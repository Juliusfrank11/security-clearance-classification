Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d, with explanations, and denied SOR
¶ 1.c, with explanations. Additional findings of fact follow.
Background Information
Applicant  is  a  47-year-old  material  management  supervisor  employed  by  a
defense  contractor  since  November  2016.  He  seeks  to  retain  his  secret  security
clearance,  which  is  a  requirement  of  his  continued  employment.  He  has  successfully
held clearances while employed by various defense contractors since 2000.  (Tr. 13-17)
Applicant  earned  his  General  Educational  Development  (GED)  certificate  in
2012. Since earning his GED, he has earned about eight college credit hours.  (Tr. 18-
20)  Applicant  married  in  2006.  He  has  an  adult  son  from  a  previous  relationship,  and
three children with his wife ages 20, 18, and 11. All three children reside with Applicant
and  he  financially  supports  them.  Applicant’s  wife  is  employed  part-time  as  an  events
planner as a non-appropriated fund employee with the Coast Guard. (Tr. 20-24)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s  responsibility  for the four  delinquent  SOR debts,  totaling  $36,985,  is
established  by  his  SOR  Answer;  his  2017,  2018,  and  2019  credit  reports;  his  2018
Office  of  Personnel  Management  Personal  Subject  Interview  (OPM  PSI);  and  his
hearing testimony.
Applicant’s financial problems trace back to his 2012 move to a high-cost location
for a better job and to provide an environment that would offer more opportunities for his
children.  After  arriving  at  his  new  location,  Applicant  found  that  his  living  expenses
exceeded  his  pay.  His  wife  began  working  outside  their  home  about  a  year  after  the
move, but not before their living costs resulted in excessive debt.  Additionally, in 2018,
Applicant’s father-in-law stayed in his home for three months prior to open-heart surgery
and during his recovery. Applicant’s wife quit her job to care for her father. In addition to
his  wife’s  loss  of  income  during  this  three-month  period,  Applicant  incurred  incidental
medical bills and transportation costs on behalf of his father-in-law. (Tr. 28-30)
The following is a summary of Applicant’s SOR debts and their status:
SOR  ¶  1.a  -  $1,200  delinquent  state  taxes  for  tax  year  2013.  Applicant  stated
that he filed his tax returns on his own for the first time using TurboTax and apparently
made a mistake. The state tax authorities caught the mistake and notified Appellant in
2014. Applicant submitted documentation that he made payment arrangements in 2018
to  pay  down  this  debt  at  a  rate  of  $50  per  month.  Post-hearing,  Applicant  submitted
documentation  that  he  is  making  payments  in  compliance  with  his  agreement.  (SOR
Answer; Tr. 31-38; AE I) DEBT BEING RESOLVED.
SOR ¶ 1.b - $8,009 charged-off automobile loan. When Applicant moved in 2012,
he sold his 2008 Toyota Highlander to an automobile dealer. However, after the sale to
the dealer, there was an $8,009 balance that remained payable to the credit union. To
cover  the  balance,  Applicant  made  an  informal  arrangement  with  his  sister-in-law  to
make payments to the credit union. Her payments to the credit union were to be in lieu
of  paying  rent  to  him  on  the  house  he  had  built.  His  sister-in-law  failed  to  honor  her
agreement,  and  the  loan  went  into  default.  Applicant  submitted  documentation  that  he
made payment arrangements in 2018 to pay down this debt at a rate of $131 per month.
Post-hearing,  Applicant  submitted  documentation  that  he  is  making  payments  in
compliance  with  his  agreement.  (SOR  Answer;  Tr.  38-47;  GE  5;  AE  E,  AE  H)  DEBT
BEING RESOLVED.
SOR ¶ 1.c - $14,993 collection account. This is the same debt alleged in SOR ¶
1.d. Applicant submitted documentation that this debt has been deleted from his credit
report. (SOR Answer; Tr. 47-49; AE E) DUPLICATE DEBT – DEBT RESOLVED.
SOR  ¶  1.d  -  $12,783  charged-off  account  for  a  personal  loan.  As  noted,  this  is
the same debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. Applicant submitted documentation that he made
payment arrangements in 2018 to pay down this debt at a rate of $100 per month. Post-
hearing, Applicant submitted documentation that he is making payments in compliance
with  his  agreement.  (SOR  Answer;  Tr.  49-51,  65-67;  AE  E,  AE  J)  DEBT  BEING
RESOLVED.
Post-hearing, Applicant submitted a budget that reflects a net monthly remainder
of  $985.  His  budget  lists  all of  his  monthly payments  to  his SOR creditors. Applicant’s
budget  also  indicates  that  he  maintains  a  modest  lifestyle  and  lives  within  his  means.
(Tr.  55-63;  AE  D)  To  improve  his  credit,  Applicant  retained  the  services  of  a  debt
resolution  company.  At  some  point  in  the  future,  the  debt  resolution  company  will
assume  making  payments  to  Applicant’s  creditors.  (Tr.  67-72;  AE  A  –  AE  C,  AE  F)
Applicant’s  post-hearing  credit  report  stated  that  all  of  his  accounts  are  in  good
standing. (AE E)
Character Evidence
Post-hearing,  Applicant  submitted  a  character  letter  from  a  senior  supervisor  at
the military installation where he is employed. The letter favorably described Applicant’s
loyalty, dedication, work ethic, and trustworthiness. (Tr. 64-65; AE K)
