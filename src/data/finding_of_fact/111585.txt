Applicant is a 62-year-old logistics analyst who has worked in that capacity for 23
years. He completed high school. He was honorably discharged from the United States
military after 22 years, he retiringed  at the rank of master sergeant. He lives well within
his means. [Otherwise sounds like he spent 22 yrs at that rank]
For  tax  years  (TY)  2012  and  2014-2015,  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file,  as
required,  his  state  and  Federal  income  tax  returns.  He  also  failed  to  timely  file,  as
required, state income tax returns for those same tax years. Usually, he used a popular
tax preparation software to file his tax returns. (Tr. 24, 31) In preparation for filing his TY
2012  returns,  he  got  frustrated  downloading  updates  to  the  software  “because  [his]
computer  was  too  old.”  (Tr.  24)  He  replaced  his  computer,  but  still  had  problems
updating the program. Increasingly frustrated, he gave up, feeling confident that at least
he owed no taxes for TY 2012. (Tr. 25)
At the time, Applicant did not know it was against the law to not file tax returns.
(Tr. 26) He said, “from the past, I’ve always received a refund. So I thought that would
still be in the same category as getting a return [sic], for state and federal.” (Tr. 26) He
felt monies owed to him as refunds were being held for him with the tax authorities and
he could “stockpile” them for later deposit into his savings or 401k accounts. (Tr. 25)
The following year,  in early 2014,  Applicant timely filed tax returns, both federal
and  state,  for  TY  2013.  (Tr.  25-26,  35,  38;  Ex.  E)  In  Applicant’s  case,  one  cannot
complete a state tax return without first finishing a federal return. He did not, however,
file  his  late  TY  2012  tax  returns  at  that  time  because  he  “didn’t  have  all  [his]
documentation.”  (Tr.  25)  He  was  working  at  home  and  managing  physical  conditions
that  would  ultimately  warrant  knee  surgery  later  that  year  and  a  heart  procedure  in
2015,  issues  that  would  distract him from  taxes.  (Tr. 35-37)   No  tax  returns  were  then
filed for TY 2014-2015. (Tr. 42-43)
In early 2017, Applicant timely completed his TY 2016 tax returns, a practice he
now continues to perform annually. (Tr. 43-44) While completing his security clearance
application (SCA) in 2017, Applicant admitted he had failed to file some tax returns. (Tr.
28) In that year he had filed his He filed his TY 2014 and TY 2015 tax returns, years for
which he was issued refunds. (Tr. 42) He forgot about the need to file his tax returns for
TY 2012 during his health issues and over time later in 2017. (Tr. 42). Since that time,
Applicant has used an accountant to prepare his tax returns. (Tr. 48)
By  2018,  Applicant  had  retained  the  services  of  an  accountant  to  handle  his
taxes. (Tr. 48) Applicant’s filed his TY 2012 tax returns were ultimately filed by in early
2019. (Tr. 32-33, 45; Ex. B) No refund was issued because he had missed the deadline
for late filing,  thus  losing  the  approximately  $4,000 he had been  owed.  He  discovered
he  had  waited  too  long  to  file  those  TY  2012  tax  returns  in  order  to  receive  the
approximately $4,000 in refunds he had been owed. (Tr. 28; Ex. B) His sister mentioned
a credit repair service that could help him get his finances in order and give him “peace
of mind,.” which he then contacted (Tr. 27, 49) It was always his intention to have all tax
requirements reviewed and completed appropriately, it just never seemed urgent to him
since  refunds  were  always  owed  and  he  was  unaware  there  were  time  limits  for
claiming refunds. His credit and financial situation have been improved and  With help,
later  refunds  were  received  from  the  taxing  authorities  and  his  financial  situation
rectified  to  the  point  that  his  credit  score  is  now  792.  (Tr.  30)  Applicant  has  no
outstanding taxes due to any taxing authority. (Tr. 29)
