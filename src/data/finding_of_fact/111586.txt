Applicant is a 42-year-old senior business analyst employed by federal contractors
since July 2009. He received a bachelor’s degree in business in 1989. (Tr. 62.) He married
in August 1996 and has an adult son. He was employed as an administrative coordinator
for a university from November 1992 to June 2009 and retired from that position.
Applicant’s  spouse  has  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  business  administration.  She
worked  for  a  real  estate  firm  and  a  title  company  before  being  hired  by  a  federal
contractor,  for  whom  she  worked  for  about  16  years.  In  January  2006,  the  federal
contractor started downsizing, and Applicant’s spouse began working as an independent
consultant in human resources for various small business, working mostly from her home.
Applicant was not involved in her consulting business. Her gross income while working
independently was ranged from about $60,000 to  about $150,000.  In November 2016,
her  primary  client  sold  his  business.  She  had  no  other  clients,  and  she  closed  her
consulting  business.  She  was  unemployed  until  she  found  employment  in  the  private
sector in July 2018. (Tr. 15-19, 53-54.)
Applicant’s  spouse  testified  that  she  had  spent  most  of  her  working  life  as  an
employee and was unfamiliar with the tax requirements for self-employed workers. Her
income fluctuated, and she consistently owed substantial federal and state income taxes
for each year, plus penalties for making  inadequate payments of estimated taxes. She
and  Applicant  twice  refinanced  the  mortgage  loan  on  their  home  to  make  monthly
payments  of  taxes  due.  She  started  looking  for  tax  help  after  the  year  she  earned
$150,000 and was confronted with a large tax liability and penalties. She did not hire an
accountant  or  tax  professional,  but  instead  she  relied  on  self-employed  friends  for  tax
advice.  Among  other  things,  she  was  advised  to  ask  Applicant  to  maximize  his  tax
withholding at the zero-exemption rate. (Tr. 37.) Applicant complied with her request. (Tr.
64.)
At about the same time that Applicant’s spouse began having tax problems, her
father had a heart attack and died suddenly. Her mother had a heart attack and moved in
with  them,  increasing  their  living  expenses.  Her  three  sisters  encountered  significant
medical problems, all of which kept her from giving full attention to her tax problems.
Applicant  and  his  spouse  kept  their  professional  lives  separate.  His  spouse
testified that he is “extremely private” about his job. She does not know what he does,
does not know his work telephone number, and has never contacted him at work. (Tr.
48.)
Applicant’s wife testified that when Applicant asked about her tax problems, she
told  him  that  she  was  working  on  them  and  had  contacted  tax  professionals  for
assistance.  In  June  2009,  Applicant’s  wife  sought  help  from  a  tax  negotiation  and
mediation service that she had learned about from an infomercial. (AE 6 at 2; Tr. 33.) She
worked  with  this  service  until  it  “sort  of  dropped  the  ball,”  and  she  then  sought  out  a
professional tax  service.  (Tr. 20-23,  58-59.)  Applicant  did  not  deal  with  either  of  these
services directly, but relied on his spouse to keep him informed. (Tr. 66.)
Applicant’s  spouse  managed  the  house  finances  until  2017.  Applicant  was  not
aware of the extent of their financial problems until he started gathering documents for a
possible bankruptcy petition. When he reviewed his credit report, he first learned about
the amounts of the federal and state tax liens as well as other delinquent debts that he
did not recognize, and he decided that they needed to talk to a lawyer. (Tr. 68-69.)
Applicant’s state of residence obtained tax liens against Applicant and his spouse
for  $2,707  in  December  2007;  $5,294  in  November  2010;  $11,463  in  October  2011;
$13,126 in December 2012; $2,016 in August 2014; $7,208 in January 2015; $14,334 in
April 2015; $9,809 in July 2015; $8,878 in December 2017. (GE 7.) The state tax liens
are alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b.
The  IRS  obtained  tax  liens  against  Applicant  and  his  spouse  for  $93,749  in
December 2013, another tax lien for $45,406 in May 2015, and a tax lien for $39,508 in
August 2016. (GE 6.) The tax levy in September 2016 was for a total of $208,835 for tax
years 2004, and tax years 2006 through 2012. (GE 2.) The federal tax debt is alleged in
SOR ¶ 1.a to be about $273,098.
In about 2014, Applicant and his wife hired a tax professional, who determined that
their tax problems arose from the failure of Applicant’s wife to make estimated quarterly
payments. (Tr. 56; AE 5.)
From  November  2016  to  June  2017,  Applicant  and  his  spouse  made  $300
estimated  tax  payments  to  the  IRS  every  month  except  May  2017.  They  made  $250
payments to the state tax authority in January, February, March, and May 2018. In 2018,
Applicant took over the family finances.
In addition to Applicant’s federal and state income tax debts, credit reports from
February  2018  and  January  2017  (GE  4  and  5)  reflected  five  delinquent  debts:  an
automobile  loan  for  $46,089,  past  due  for  $760  (SOR  ¶  1.c);  a  mortgage  loan  for
$544,000,  past  due for $3,271,  with  a  balance  of  $359,424  (SOR ¶  1.d); a  credit-card
account charged off for $2,165 (SOR ¶ 1.e); and two medical bills referred for collection
of $882 (SOR ¶ 1.f) and $85 (SOR ¶ 1.g).
On September 6, 2018, Applicant and his wife filed a joint Chapter 13 bankruptcy
petition, having completed the financial counseling required by the bankruptcy court. Their
petition included all the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant reported monthly
gross income of $9,166 and his spouse reported $1,122. Their joint disposable income
was calculated to be $3,026. They listed assets of $479,881 and liabilities of $542,118.
(GE  8.)  Their  payment  plan  was  confirmed  in  March  2019  and  provided  for  monthly
payments of $3,100 for 23 months followed by $3,605 for 27 months. The plan required
that Applicant and his wife surrender the automobile that was the collateral for the debt
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c and pay the mortgage lender alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d directly outside
the plan.
As of the date of the hearing, Applicant and his spouse had paid $21,700 into the
payment plan, of which $17,918 had been disbursed, and had made the first five monthly
payments under the plan. (AE 12; AE 13; AE 15.) Applicant testified that the payments
on the mortgage loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d were current as of September 2018, when he
filed his bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 97-98.)
Applicant summarized his attitude about the bankruptcy by equating it to buying a
new car. He testified,
I want to do my 60 months, pay what I have to pay, pay when I have to pay,
do what the trustee tells me I need to do, follow [his lawyer’s] instructions.
And  at  the  end  of  the  60  months  I  want  a  document  that  says,  Mr.
[Applicant],  you’ve  satisfied  everything  that  was  required  of  you  via  the
Federal Government, and you can go on with your life and don’t do it again.
(Tr. 93.)
Applicant’s financial manager has known him for about ten years. She regards him
as a person of good moral character who operates with integrity, works hard and “never
has a bad word to say about anyone.” She believes he is efficient, detail-oriented, and
extremely  competent.  He  is  well  organized,  never  misses  a  deadline,  or  forgets  an
assignment. (GE 14 at 1.)
One  of  Applicant’s  co-workers,  who  has  known  him  for  about  three  years,
considers  him  intelligent,  capable,  and  dedicated.  He  has  observed  that  he  is  always
“quick on his feet,” with sensible reactions in various situations requiring decisive action,
and he demonstrates high morals and integrity in everything he does. (GE 14 at 2.)
