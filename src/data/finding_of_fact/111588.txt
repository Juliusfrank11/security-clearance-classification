In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR  (Answer),  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations
except SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 2.a, and 2.b, which he denied. His admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact. He is 29 years old. As of the date of the hearing, he was engaged to
be  married  to  his  girlfriend  of  11  years,  who  is  the  mother of  their  two  minor  children.
(Answer; Tr. at 11-14, 47-48, 77, 91-97, 115, 124-125, 135-140, 144-146; GE 1)
Applicant graduated from high school in 2008. He earned an associate’s degree
in 2016 and a bachelor’s degree in 2018. As of the date of the hearing, he has worked
as  an  information  technology  help  desk  analyst  for  his  current  employer,  a  DOD
contractor,  since  November  2017.  He  also  worked  as  a  part-time  children’s  football
official since 2008. He has never held a security clearance. (Tr. at 9-10, 15, 47, 89-91,
96-97, 135-138; GE 1; AE A)
In  approximately  May  2009,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving
under the influence (DUI) of alcohol or drugs, first offense, and purchase or possession
of  alcohol.  He  was  18  years  old.  This  was  his  first  criminal-related  offense.  He  was
driving  a  friend  to  7-11  when  the  police  pulled  him  over  for  a  broken  tail  light.  He
testified  that  he  had  previously  been  at  a  party  where  he  had  taken  a  sip  of  a  drink
thinking it was juice, but when he realized it contained alcohol he “tried to quickly spit it
out.” His blood alcohol content (BAC) was .002%. The charges were nolle prossed. He
testified that his attorney told him and his father that they did not have to worry  as the
case was closed. (SOR ¶ 1.a; Tr. at 48-52, 56-57, 97-106; GE 1-4)
In approximately May 2010, when Applicant was 19 years old, the charge of DUI
of  alcohol  or  drugs,  as  set  forth  above,  was  reinstated,  to  his  surprise.  He  was
represented  by  an  attorney,  and  this  case  was  consolidated  with  his  December  2010
charge  of  marijuana  possession  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  2.b),  as  discussed  below.  Applicant
testified  that  his  attorney  advised  him  to  plead  guilty,  because  he  could  not  afford  to
fight the charge and he did not want to delay his efforts at the time to enlist in the U.S.
military. He pled guilty to DUI of alcohol or drugs in February 2011, and was sentenced
to 60 days in jail, suspended, fined $500, and his driver’s license was suspended for 12
months. (SOR ¶ 1.a; Tr. at 48-52, 56-57, 97-110; GE 1-4)
In  approximately  December  2010,  at  age  20,  Applicant  was  charged  with
marijuana  possession.  He  testified  that  at  his  sister’s  request,  he  drove  to  a  fast  food
restaurant to buy her food, using her car as he did not own a car at the time, when he
was pulled over by the police for failure to yield. The police officer found an empty bag
in the car and claimed it was an “empty marijuana pack.” Applicant testified that though
he was aware that his sister smoked marijuana on occasion, he was unaware that she
had any marijuana-related paraphernalia in the car. He was given a ticket to show up to
court. He was represented by an attorney, and this case was consolidated with his May
2010 charge of DUI alcohol or drugs (SOR ¶ 1.a), as set forth above. He testified that
his attorney told him he was just getting a ticket. In February 2011, he also pled guilty to
the amended charged of paraphernalia possession. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail
with 85 days suspended, placed on unsupervised probation for 3 years, and fined $416.
He spent about a weekend in jail. (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 2.b; Tr. at 52-60, 103-110; GE 1, 5)
In  approximately  May  2011,  at  age  20,  Applicant  was  charged  with  marijuana
possession,  driving  with  a  suspended  or  revoked  license,  and  driving  with  a  defective
brake light, all of which occurred on a military base. He testified that he was pulled over
on the base in which he worked while smoking a Black & Mild cigar. He testified that the
cigar did not contain marijuana, and he believed the police pulled him over because of
racial  profiling,  as  he  is  an  African  American  man.  He  testified  that  the  car  he  was
driving was a relative’s car, as he still did not own a car at the time, and the police found
marijuana in the car. Applicant denied that the marijuana belonged to him and testified
that he was unaware of any marijuana present in the car. He was given a ticket to show
up  to  court.  He  was  represented  by  a  court-appointed  attorney.  He  testified  that  he
underwent random pre-trial drug testing for five to six months, and approximated that he
was  drug  tested  five  to  ten  times  during  this  period.  He  pled  guilty  in  a  federal  district
court  to  the  infraction of  driving  without a  valid  operator’s  license and  was  fined  $100;
the remaining charges were dismissed. (SOR ¶ 1.c; Tr. at 58-63, 110-116; GE 6-7)
Applicant attributed his criminal involvement from 2009 to 2011 to not fulfilling his
father’s expectations after he graduated from high school. He described his father, who
is honorably retired from the U.S. military, as an “accomplished” man, and he felt like he
was  a  disappointment.  He  “got  depressed.”  He  testified  that  he  was  young,  he  made
mistakes trying to find himself, and he associated with the wrong crowd. (Tr. at 46-48,
77, 91-97, 115, 135-140, 144-146; AE A)
In approximately December 2014, at age 24, Applicant was charged with stealing
from a military  exchange  an  iPhone  USB  charging  cable  and a  pair  of  gloves,  with  an
aggregate value of less than $1,000, and assaulting an employee of the exchange.  He
was at the commissary visiting his mother, who worked there. He testified that he was
hurriedly shopping, without a cart and while on his phone, when he accidentally walked
out of  the exchange  with  a $10  cellular phone  charger  before  paying  for it, as  he  was
rushing  to  get  home  to  his  pregnant  fiancée.  When  he  then  attempted  to  pay  for  the
charger,  he  was  not  permitted  to  do  so.  He  denied  assaulting  any  employee  of  the
exchange. He was handcuffed and then released and given a ticket to show up to court.
He  testified  that  he  consulted  with  a  private  attorney,  but  elected  to  accept  a  court-
appointed  attorney  instead.  In  March  2015,  he  pled  guilty  in  a  federal  district  court  to
theft of government property and was sentenced to six months of supervised probation
and fined $150.  He  testified  that  he  chose  to  plead  guilty  because  “there  really  wasn’t
nothing I could really do to get around it.” He continued, “I just wanted to move forward.
I accepted it.” (SOR ¶ 1.d; Tr. at 42, 63-67, 115-124; GE 1, 8-9)
In  approximately  August  2015,  at  age  24,  Applicant  was  charged  with  felony
possession with intent to distribute five+ pounds of marijuana, felony transporting five+
pounds of marijuana, and resisting arrest. As of the date of the hearing, this was his last
criminal  offense.  He  stated  the  following  in  his  2017  security  clearance  application
(SCA):
An  unknown  package  arrived  at  my  parents[’]  home.  I  wrote  [“]wrong
address[”] on the package without opening the package. At this point I am
completely unaware of what the package contained. I put the package in
my  car  with  intentions  to  return  it  to  the  post  office.  I  am  unaware  that
there  were  unmarked  police  cars  parked  around  my  neighborhood
watching me. By the time I drove to the end of my street, I was pulled over
by  several  police  officers.  I  was  taken  to  the  police  station  and  was
informed  the  package  contained  marijuana.  I  cooperated  with  the  police
hoping  to  find  [anyone]  who  could  have  used  my  address  without  my
knowledge or consent. I was the one who suffered being charged for this
offense I had no intentions of committing.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 2.b; Tr. at 38-46, 67-78, 124-135, 140-141; GE 1, 10-11; AE A)
Applicant reiterated the same narrative at hearing. He testified that this incident
occurred  in  April  2015.  At  the  the  time,  he,  his fiancée,  and  his  children  lived  with  his
parents in their home. He testified that when the police took him to his parents’ home,
where he was observed to have received the package and after they stopped him as he
was  en  route  to  the  post  office,  they  entered  the  home  aggressively  to  search  it.  He
testified that the police assumed he would be resistant because of his size, and things
got  “crazy”  because  everyone  in  the  home  at  the  time,  to  include  his  mother  and
fiancée, demanded that the police show them their search warrant. He testified that the
police  did  not  find  anything  in  the  home.  He  stated  in  his  SCA  and  testified  that  the
federal  authorities  told  him  they  did  not  believe  he  was  involved  with  the  marijuana
package  and did not pursue  criminal charges  against him,  but  county  authorities  were
looking for a conviction and he fit the bill.  He testified that the county had a conviction
rate  of  approximately  97%,  and  he  believed  his  ethnicity  factored  into  their  pursuit  of
criminal  charges  against  him,  which  did  not  occur until  approximately  six  months  after
the  incident,  in  August  2015;  Applicant’s  father  echoed  the  same  sentiment  in  the
reference letter he wrote for Applicant. (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 2.b; Tr. at 38-46, 67-78, 124-135,
140-141; GE 1, 10-11; AE A)
Applicant  was  represented  by  an  attorney.  He  pled  guilty  to  possession  with
intent to distribute five+ pounds of marijuana. He testified that he did so because he was
scared and  he  did not  believe  he  had another choice,  as  his attorney  told  him  that  he
was facing five to ten years in jail, his attorney’s fees were $25,000, and he had to think
about  his  young  family.  He  testified  that  his  attorney  advised  him  to  plead  guilty
because “it’s about the jury and the area you’re living in and the county of how you look,
you fit the profile.” He testified that his attorney told him that “if you plead guilty, you can
start fresh  and  you  can  start  your  life  over.”  He  also  testified  that  he  believed  he  was
pleading  guilty  to  a  misdemeanor,  because  he  was  told  such  by  his  attorney.  The
charge of “resisting arrest” was dropped because he was compliant. He was sentenced
to  10  years  in  jail,  with  9  years  and  1  month  suspended,  his  driver’s  license  was
suspended  for  six  months,  and  he  was  fined  $628;  the  remaining  charges  were  nolle
prossed. (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 2.b; Tr. at 38-46, 67-87, 124-135, 140-141; GE 1, 10-11; AE A)
Applicant served 10 months in jail, from May 2016 to March 2017. He was  then
placed  on  work  release  and  required  to  report  in  person  to  his  probation  officer  once
monthly.  After  several  months,  his  in-person  probation  requirement  was  switched  to
once every three months; it was then lifted and he was required to simply  call into his
probation officer once monthly. He testified that he was drug tested during the period in
which  he  was  on  probation,  initially  once  every  three  months  and  then  randomly.  He
completed  probation  in  August  2018.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.e,  2.b;  Tr.  at  38-46,  67-87,  124-135,
140-141; GE 1, 10-11)
In approximately March 2017, at age 26, Applicant was found by a federal district
court to have violated his federal probation from his March 2015 conviction for theft of
government  property  (SOR  ¶  1.d),  as  a  result  of  his  August  2015  felony  charges,  as
discussed  above  (SOR  ¶¶  1.e,  2.b).  His  federal  probation  was  revoked  and  he  was
sentenced  to  15  days  in  jail,  with  credit  for  time  served.  He  served  this  time  in
conjunction with the 10 months that he served from 2016 to 2017. (SOR ¶ 1.f; Tr. at 78-
79, 134-135, 140-141; GE 12-14)
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  unaware  at  the  time  that  his  guilty  pleas  to  the
charges  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  to  1.e  equated  to  admissions  of  guilt.  He  testified  that  he  was
also unaware that he was developing a criminal record as a result of his guilty pleas. He
testified  that  he  only  began  to  understand  the  meaning  of  his  guilty  pleas  when  he
started  the  security  clearance  process  in  approximately  2017.  He testified  that  had  he
truly understood, he would have taken a “different approach” and he “would have fought
for more than just always pleading, pleading, pleading.” (Tr. at 108-110, 144-146)
Applicant used marijuana at least two to three times in approximately April 2014.
He testified that this was the first time he used marijuana, and  he experimented with it
socially with friends. He stated in his SCA that he did not intend to use marijuana in the
future  because  he  has  two  children  to  support,  he  planned  on  marrying,  and  he
intended  to  continue  his  career  in  information  technology.  He  denied  using  marijuana
after  April  2014,  and  denied  using  it  in  April  2017.  He  testified  that  he  could  not  have
used marijuana in 2017 because he was being drug tested as part of his probation for
his felony conviction (SOR ¶ 1.e), as discussed above. He testified that he had not been
drug tested since he completed probation in August 2018, and he had not yet been drug
tested  by  his  current  employer  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing.  He  testified  that  he  no
longer socialized with the individuals with whom he used marijuana in 2014. He testified
that if he were ever to find himself in a situation where illegal drugs were being used, or
legal drugs were being misused, he would leave. (SOR ¶ 2.a; Tr. at 79-89, 93-94, 107-
108, 141-142; GE 1)
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  a  “different  person.”  He  acknowledged  the
mistakes he made in his past, but stressed that “I wake up and do everything differently.
I  got  kids  that  look  up  to  me.”  He  stated  that  he  took  “full  responsibility  and
accountability [for] each of these situations and encounters I have ever had with the law
enforcement.”  Since  he  began  working  for  his  employer  in  November  2017,  he  has
received two pay increases and earned $40,000 annually as of the date of the hearing.
He testified that he has not had  any unfavorable issues at work and his employer was
aware  of  his  criminal history.  He  was  rated  favorably  in  his  2018  performance  review.
He earned a grade point average of 3.8 with his bachelor’s degree. He moved out of his
parents’ home in 2018 and has since rented a home for himself, his fiancée, and their
children. He testified that he is a family man, and he spends time with  them during his
free time. (Tr. at 77, 91-97, 115, 135-140, 144-146; AE A)
Applicant’s father described him as a “good man who has gone through the many
challenges that many of America’s young black men  [go] through . . . .” Having held a
security  clearance  and  worked  as  a  security  manager  during  his  military  career,  his
father stated that Applicant’s character was evidenced by the trust he has earned from
the  various  individuals  who  provided  references  on  his  behalf.  His  coworker  of  two
years  attested  to  his  work  ethic,  professionalism,  timeliness,  and  positivity.  His  former
high-school basketball coach described him as a dedicated family man of strong moral
character. Several other individuals who have known Applicant for a number of years, to
include one who has known him since 1998 and another who has been a fellow referee
since  2014,  reiterated  that  Applicant  possessed  the  character  and  trustworthiness  to
hold a security clearance. (AE A).
