Applicant admitted that, as of September 28, 2018 (the date of the SOR) he: (1)
had failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2017 (SOR
¶  1.a); (2)  had failed  to  timely  file  state  income  tax  returns for tax  years 2011  through
2017 (SOR ¶ 1.b); was indebted to his state for an income tax lien issued in May 2017
for $9,481 (SOR ¶ 1.c); and (3) had an unpaid $7,333 judgment filed against him by a
bank in November 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.d).
Applicant  did  not  disclose  in  his  2016  SCA  his  failure  to  timely  file  federal  and
state  income  tax  returns,  and  that  he  owed  state  taxes.  He  was  interviewed  by  a
government investigator in March 2017. During the interview, he volunteered his failure
to file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015. He failed
to  disclose  he  had  not  filed  federal  income  tax  returns  for  years  2012  and  2016,  and
state tax returns for tax years 2011, 2012, and 2016. Applicant told the investigator that
he  failed  to  file  because  he  was  living  overseas  and  did  not  have  all  the  required
documents. He promised to file in the coming weeks. He also volunteered that he had
failed to disclose in his 2016 SCA that his business credit-card account was cancelled
for lack of payments in March 2016. He told the investigator that he had paid the credit-
card account in full. He claimed both omissions were an oversight.
Under  Guideline  B,  the  SOR  alleged,  and  Applicant  admitted  that:  (1)  his  wife
and three children are dual citizens of the United States and France (SOR  ¶¶ 2.a and
2.b);  (2)  his  in-laws  are  citizens  and  residents  of  France  (SOR  ¶  2.c);  (3)  he  owns  a
home in France with an estimated value of $600,000, with a $200,000 mortgage (SOR ¶
2.d); (4) he anticipated receiving $1,000 a month from the French government upon his
retirement at age 65 (SOR ¶ 2.e); and (5) he anticipated receiving a $600,000 lump sum
from the Swiss government upon his retirement at age 65 (SOR ¶ 2.f).
Applicant’s  SOR  admissions,  and  those  at  the  hearing,  are  incorporated  herein
as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  61-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  graduated  from
high school in 1976, completed a bachelor’s degree in 1981, and a master’s degree in
1988.  All  his  education  was  completed  in  U.S.  academic  institutions. While  in  college,
he  started  working  part  time  for  a  federal  agency.  After  earning  his  master’s  degree,
Applicant  was  hired  full  time  by  the  federal  agency  and  worked  abroad  between  1989
and  1999. The federal  agency  granted  him access to  classified  information  at  the top-
secret level. While employed with the federal agency, Applicant contributed into its thrift
savings plan and currently has a balance of about $201,000. (AE 7)
After  leaving  the  federal  agency,  Applicant  worked  for  a  large  international
corporation between 1999 and 2004, and lectured at a French University between 2000
and  2005.  Between  2004  and  2012,  Applicant  worked  for  a  private  company  in
Switzerland, and between around 2011 and 2012, he worked for a private company in a
Middle Eastern country. He worked for a private company in France between 2012 and
2014. He returned to the United States in 2014, because his father was ill. He has been
working as vice-president for a federal contractor, his clearance sponsor, since 2014.
Applicant married a French citizen in 1986 in France. They have three children,
ages 31, and 28 (twins). His wife and children are now dual citizens of the United States
and France. He testified that he still provides financial assistance  to all of his children.
His older daughter lives in France in the house Applicant purchased in 2005 for about
$620,000.  He estimated the  value of  the property  at  $650,000  when he  completed  his
2016  SCA.  At  hearing,  Applicant  claimed  the  property  value  was  currently  closer  to
$400,000.  He  submitted  no documentary  evidence  concerning  the  current  value  of  his
French property.
Applicant opened a bank account in France while he was working there between
1989 and 1999. He currently maintains approximately $9,000 in the account to pay for
his  living  expenses  when  he  travels  to  France,  for  his  daughter’s  financial  assistance,
and  to  pay  the  mortgage  on  the  home  in  France.  Additionally,  he  disclosed  having  a
Swiss  bank  account  with  about  $150  (GE  2),  and  a  Swiss  retirement  account  with  an
estimated  value  of  $600,000.  At  the  time  he  completed  the  2016  SCA,  Applicant
believed  he  was  entitled  to  French  social  security  benefits,  which  he  estimated  at
$1,000 per month after age 65.
Applicant  claimed  that  while  working  for  the  U.S.  federal  agency  in  France,  he
always filed his income tax returns and paid his taxes on time. He stated that he  later
paid  income  taxes  to  Switzerland,  because  he  worked  there,  and  property  taxes  to
France,  because  he  owns  a  house  there.  He  explained  that  he  was  “getting  lazy  and
filing his taxes in batches, two or three years at a time.” (Tr. 35-36) Applicant mistakenly
believed he owed no taxes to the federal government because he was taking minimum
deductions and the first $100,000 of income was not taxable under the foreign income
tax deduction. (Tr. 36-37)
Applicant filed his federal income tax return for tax year 2012 in March 2017. For
tax  year  2013,  he  filed  his  federal  income  tax  return  in  March  2019.  The  2013  IRS
account  transcript  indicates  he  was  assessed  a  penalty  for  filing  his  2013  return  late
($216), and paid interest for late payment of taxes ($233). For tax year 2014, he filed his
federal income tax return in December 2018. The 2014 IRS account transcript indicates
he had filed for an extension of time to file his 2014 tax return, but did not file the return
until 2018.
For tax year 2015, Applicant filed his federal income tax return in June 2019. The
2015 IRS account transcript indicates he was assessed a penalty for late filing, and paid
a  penalty  for late  payment  of taxes  ($558) and  was  charged  interest  ($1,416).  For tax
year  2016,  he  filed  his  federal  income  tax  return  in  July  2018.  The  2016  IRS  account
transcript  indicates  he  had  a  $6,800  credit.  For  tax  year  2017,  he  filed  his  federal
income tax return in December 2018. The 2017 IRS account transcript indicates he had
a $14,661 credit. For tax year 2018, he timely filed his federal income tax return in April
2019.
Applicant filed his state income tax returns for years 2011 through 2017 in 2019.
As  of  August  26,  2019,  he  had  an  outstanding  state  tax  debt  of  about  $107,668,  plus
$2,587 for penalties and interest accrued. He paid his state tax debt in full in August 29,
2019. The state tax judgment against him was removed upon payment of the tax debt.
(AE  3,  SOR  ¶  2.c)  Additionally,  he  presented  documentary  evidence  showing  that  a
bank lien filed against his property was released after payment of the debt in July 2019.
(AE 1 and 2; SOR ¶ 2.d)
At  his  hearing,  Applicant  explained  that  there  were  numerous  reasons  for  his
failure  to  timely  file  his  income  tax  returns:  (1)  he  was  distracted  about  his  tax  filing
obligations because he had to return to the United States in 2014 to be with his father
who  was seriously ill  and passed away in 2014; (2) he was earning about $500,000 a
year abroad, and when he returned to the United States, he lost half of his earnings; (3)
after his father died in 2014, the executor of the estate failed to resolve the estate and
there  were  tax  problems  associated  with  it;  (4)  he  was  unconcerned  about  filing  his
federal income tax returns because he believed he was paying any taxes owed through
his  withholdings;  (5)  in  2013,  he  started  to  receive  income  from  his  beach  rental
property  and  he  did  not  know  how  to  file  the  income  tax  returns;  and  (6)  he  failed  to
seek help from a tax professional.
Concerning  his  Swiss  retirement  account  with  an  estimated  value  of  $600,000,
Applicant  received  a  lump-sum  payment  of  $491,504  and  transferred  the  money  to  a
United States bank, except for $43,000 Swiss francs that Switzerland retained, in 2019.
Applicant  testified  that  he  used  the  lump-sum  payment  to  pay  off  all  of  his  delinquent
debts and past-due taxes. (AE 6; Tr. 46)
Concerning the anticipated $1,000 a month French social security pension upon
his  retirement  at  age  65,  Applicant  testified  that  he  was  mistaken  about  it.  He  now
believes that he needed to work and contribute into the French retirement system for 10
years to vest into the French social security pension plan. Because he only worked and
contributed during seven years, he now believes he is not entitled to any pension.
In  2011,  Applicant  purchased  land  in  a  U.S.  state  to  build  a  beach  retirement
home. He completed construction of the home in 2013. Since then, he has been using
the beach property as a business property where he rents it most of the year, except for
the time when he and his family use it during the summers. Applicant’s beach property
has  an  estimated  market  value  of  $1.2  million.  He  owes  $261,000  on  the  house
mortgage, plus an additional $170,000 on a home equity loan. (AE 5)
Applicant anticipates retiring in the United States in about five years, after paying
all  of  his  mortgages.  He  intends  to  live  at  his  U.S.  beach  property,  and  to  travel  to
France  once  in  a  while  to  visit  his  daughter  and  his  wife’s  relatives.  He  was  issued  a
French “green card” when he lived in France, but it expired in July 2019. He claimed he
cannot renew it because he no longer lives in France. It is not clear whether he and his
wife owning property in France  is a consideration for his eligibility to renew his French
“green card.” (Tr. 74)
Applicant  expressed  remorse  for  not  filing  his  income  tax  returns  on  time.  He
claimed  that  he  has  learned  a  hard  lesson  and  promised  to  timely  file  his  income  tax
returns  and  to  pay  his  taxes  in  the  future.  Applicant  presented  little  documentary
evidence to show that he had contact with the IRS, the state tax authority, or  his bank
creditor before he submitted his 2016 SCA.
At the hearing, Applicant highlighted his work abroad in an important position for
a federal agency for about 10 years. During that period, he represented U.S. interests in
several foreign countries.  He believes his past  employment and  behavior have proven
that he is not a security risk. Applicant noted that  his current earnings are sufficient  to
pay  his  financial  obligations  and  living  expenses.  Moreover,  he  established  that  the
value of his assets in the United States exceeds the value of his assets in any foreign
country, including France. I find that he participated in financial counseling provided by
his attorney.
Applicant  submitted  reference  statements  from  two  long-time  friends,  one  of
which  was  also  a  professional  colleague,  and  a  retired  U.S.  major  general.  His
references consider Applicant to be trustworthy, reliable, diligent, and a loyal American
patriot.  They  recommended  Applicant’s  eligibility  for  a  clearance  without  reservations.
(AE 8)
Relations between the United States and France are active and friendly. The two
countries share common values and have parallel policies on most political, economic,
and  security  issues.  Differences  are  discussed  frankly  and  have  not  generally  been
allowed to impair the pattern of close cooperation that characterizes relations between
the  two  countries.  (U.S.  Department  of  State,  U.S.  Relations  with  France,  See,
