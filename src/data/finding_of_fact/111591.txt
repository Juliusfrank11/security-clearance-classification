Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since May 2018. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from
1991 until he was honorably discharged in 1996. He is married with three adult children
and an adult stepchild. ((Tr.) at 26-27, 38; GE 1)
Applicant earned a good salary while working overseas for a defense contractor
from 2006 to 2008. He did not make as much upon his return to the United States. He
and  his  family  did  not  sufficiently  adjust  their  lifestyle  to  their  lesser  income,  and
financial difficulties ensued. (Tr. at 18-19, 29-31)
Applicant  was  unable  to  maintain  his  mortgage  loan  payments.  He  filed  a
Chapter  13  bankruptcy  case  in  June  2010.  In  December  2012,  the  case  was  closed
without  a  discharge  because  Applicant  failed  to  file  a  financial  management  course
certificate  and  a  certificate  under  11  U.S.C.  §  1328  concerning  his  domestic  support
obligations. (Tr. at 31-34; GE 3, 5)
Applicant  needed additional assistance  with  his mortgage.  He  and  his wife  filed
another  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  case  in  December  2015.  He  was  able  to  obtain  a
mortgage loan modification, and he stopped paying the bankruptcy plan. The case was
dismissed  in  February  2017  for failure  to  make  plan  payments.  Applicant  and  his  wife
paid $6,450 into the plan during the course of the bankruptcy. Of that amount, $4,000
went to his attorney; $367 went to the trustee; and $2,082 was paid to his creditors. (Tr.
at 33-34; GE 6)
The  SOR  alleges  the  two  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  cases;  $13,312  owed  for  the
balance due on an auto loan after the vehicle was repossessed; a mortgage loan that
was  $23,638  past  due;  and  two  delinquent  telecommunications  debts  totaling  $1,574.
The allegations are established through credit reports and Applicant’s admissions.
Applicant paid the two telecommunications debts in April 2019, and he is current
on his modified mortgage loan. He has been unable to work out  payments for the auto
loan.  He  called  the  creditor,  who  told  him  to  contact  the  collection  company.  The
collection company told him they did not have his account. The most recent credit report
lists  a  balance  of  $718,  which  is  much  less  than  the  $13,312  balance  listed  on  a
previous  credit  report.  The  larger  figure  may  be  the  balance  before  the  repossessed
vehicle  was  sold,  and  the  smaller figure  may  be  the  remaining  balance.  (Tr. at  20-25,
31, 39-40; GE 3, 4, 7; AE A-C)
Applicant realized that he had to make changes to his finances. He will still help
his adult children if necessary, but not to the extent that he once did. He emphasized to
them  that  they  have  to  be  responsible for themselves.  He has  been  working  overseas
since July 2018. His wife has a good job. Their current finances are sound. He is able to
pay his bills, contribute to his 401(k) retirement account, and not accrue any additional
delinquent debts. The repossessed auto loan alleged in SOR  ¶ 1.c is the only account
with a balance on his March 2020 credit report. He has learned valuable lessons, and
he credibly testified that there will be no repeat of the conditions that led to his financial
problems. (Tr. at 19-20, 25-28, 35, 38-42; GE 3, 4, 7)
