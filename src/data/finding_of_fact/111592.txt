Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served in the Air
National  Guard  from  1996  until  he  was  honorably  discharged  in  2002.  He  graduated
from law school in 2008. He is married with children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 57, 159; GE 1-

Applicant  worked  in  software  development  before  he  went  to  law  school.  He
practiced law for a period, but then went back to software development. He worked for a
defense  contractor  from  2009  to  2017,  primarily  as  a  software  developer  and  system
administrator at a DOD agency. (Tr. at 57-60, 87; GE 1-3)
In August 2017, the DOD agency notified the Inspector General (IG) that during
routine  monitoring  of  Internet  usage  and  network  traffic,  they  detected  that  Applicant
used a government information technology (IT) system to view illicit material containing
sexual content, which was against the agency’s IT policy. The report indicated:

In January 2017, Applicant searched Google for “girl rubbing herself.” The search
contained nude images and sexual content.
In  June  2017,  Applicant  searched  Google  for  “rubbing  her  [vulgar  term  for
vagina].” The search contained nude images and sexual content.
In June 2017, Applicant searched Google for “female oral.” Applicant then viewed
several pages of nude images of men and women engaged in sexual acts. (GE

The agency further reported that since 2012, Applicant had been involved in 19
other cases of unauthorized software downloads. The software included graphics, audio
and  music  editing  software,  bar  examination  preparation  software,  and  text  editing
software.  The  agency  noted  that  Applicant  was  sent  a  user  account-violation  warning
letter on a specific date in April 2016. (GE 4, 5)
In  August  2017,  Applicant’s  access  to  the  DOD  agency’s  network  was
suspended, and he was escorted off the premises. He asserted that he was not told the
reason. He wrote an e-mail with a copy to the IG. He thought the IG might already have
an  open  investigation,  and  he  was  “concerned  that  [he]  was  being  inappropriately
removed”  from  the  contract.  He  wrote:  “If  the  reason  that  I’m  being  removed  for  is
working on [an]other project for another company, during contract hours, I would like to
explain.”  He  indicated  that  during  lulls  in  work  or  when  he  needed  a  break,  he  would
practice programming on his personal websites. (Tr. at 111-117; GE 4, 6)
The IG obtained a report of Applicant’s unclassified Internet usage. From March
2017 through August 2017, Applicant visited his personal websites 1,015 times. The IG
contacted  an  unidentified  individual,  who  stated  that  Applicant’s  use  of  his  personal
websites for duty-related purposes was not in compliance with the contract statement of
work (SOW). (GE 6)
Applicant was interviewed over the telephone by an IG investigator in December
2017.  He  stated  that  he  used  his  personal  websites  to  practice  programming  and
develop solutions for site problems at the DOD agency. He estimated that from March
2017  to  August  2017,  he  visited  his  personal  websites  about  three  to  four  times  per
week, for up to two hours per day. The IG estimated that equated to between 150 and
200  hours  at  an  hourly  rate  of  $153,  or  between  $23,071  and  $30,762.  The  IG
concluded that Applicant committed contractor cost mischarging (labor hours) when he
submitted  fraudulent  timesheets  that  included  150  to  200  hours  that  he  spent  working
on tasks not specified in the contract SOW. The U.S. Government apparently recouped
an amount in the above range from a defense contractor. (Tr. at 113-121, 148-151; GE
6)
Applicant  denied  some  of  the  conduct  and  explained  the  rest.  He  admitted  that
he downloaded software, but he stated that it was  primarily for his job. He was a data
transfer officer (DTO) who would download items for others. He admitted downloading a
few  programs  that  were  not  for  his  job,  such  as  a  Sudoku  solver  and  an  audio
manipulation program that he used to make old songs sound better. He does not recall
downloading  the  bar  examination  preparation  software,  but  he  surmises  that  he  likely
did.  He  stated  that  employees  were  permitted  incidental  non-official  use  of  their
computers,  and  he  did  not  realize  that  he  was  unauthorized  to  download  any  of  the
software. He denied ever receiving a warning letter. He stated that the only thing he was
told was that the Sudoku solver was unauthorized, and it was deleted from his system.
(Tr. at 59-70, 85-86, 123-127, 153-155; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant denied intentionally submitting fraudulent timesheets. He asserted that
his use of his websites was to hone his skills as a software developer or to benefit the
DOD  agency.  Additionally,  incidental  non-official  use  of  the  computer  was  permitted.
(Tr. at 59-60, 86-101, 141-153, 156-159; AE 5-7)
Applicant admitted that he conducted the Google searches on the government IT
system,  which  revealed  inappropriate  material,  but  he  denied  that  he  viewed  sexually
explicit material. Applicant was involved in an online affair with a woman he had  never
met in person. The affair included graphic chats and exchanges from his phone, which
involved  sexually  explicit  materials  and  “phone  sex.”  He  wanted  to  send  her  flirtatious
and  suggestive  material with  “non-explicit  but  sexual images” using  the  GIF  (Graphics
Interchange Format - short animated or moving pictures) format over the government IT
system. He knew the system had SafeSearch, which would screen out most, but not all,
graphic materials. He admitted that even with SafeSearch on, he “came across explicit
images a few times. [He] did not download these and browsed away quickly, or closed
the  browser.”  He  also  admitted  that  he  “had  several  inappropriate  text  conversations”
with the woman from a government computer. (Tr. at 71-77, 82-84, 102-106, 128-141,
155-156; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE 3, 4, 15)
Applicant  described  one  of  the  GIFs  he  sent  as  what  appeared  to  be  a  man
performing  oral  sex  on  a  woman.  Another  was  of  a  woman  with  her  hand  inside  her
underwear  apparently  masturbating.  He  asserted  that  there  was  no  visible  nudity  or
genitalia in any of the GIFs. (Tr. at 71-72, 83-84, 133-134; GE 2, 3; AE 3)
Applicant stated that his affair with the woman ended in August 2017, a few days
before he was removed from the contract. He asserted that he was never told why he
was  removed  from  the  contract.  He  thought  the  affair  itself,  but  not  necessarily  the
inappropriate searches, might have been discovered. He stated that he did not think the
inappropriate  searches  and  images  were  an  issue  until  he  thought  it  through  about  a
week or two after he was removed from the contract. He told his wife of the online affair
in August 2017. He also sought advice and counseling through his church. (Tr. at 78-80,
101, 106-113; AE 4, 9, 14)
Applicant thought the affair could have been “a point of blackmail.” He indicated
that he “drafted a letter to self-report in August of 2017 but was advised to not report by
a  trusted  advisor.”  He  discussed  the  information  during  his  background  interview  in
March  2018.  He  reported  the  information  to  his  facility  security  officer  (FSO)  in  April
2018. In that report, he indicated the incidents happened “[d]uring a rough patch in [his]
marriage in May-July 2017.” When asked at hearing how that accounted for his search
in January 2017, he stated that  he and the woman were friends before January 2017,
and the flirtatious behavior, but not the full online affair, started in January 2017.  (Tr. at
78, 107-111, 131-132; AE 4, 14)
Applicant  apologized  for  his  inappropriate  conduct.  His  actions  cost  him  his  job
and almost his marriage. He asserted that he has learned a valuable and costly lesson,
and that the conduct will not be repeated. (Tr. at 81-82, 121-122, 137)
Applicant  volunteers  in  his  community,  and  he  is  active  in  his  church.  He
submitted  documents  and  letters  attesting  to  his  moral  character  and  excellent  job
performance.  He  is  praised  for  his  work  ethic,  honesty,  trustworthiness,  judgment,
loyalty,  strength,  determination,  dependability,  integrity,  and  willingness  and  ability  to
protect  classified  information.  He  is  recommended  for  a  security  clearance.  (Tr.  at  18-
35, 51-54; AE 8-13)
