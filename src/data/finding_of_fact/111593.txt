In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations.  His
admission in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 46-year-old security officer employed by a federal contractor since
August 2016. He was self-employed from August 2007 to August 2011. He worked as an
unarmed security officer for a non-governmental employer from August 2011 until he was
hired  for his  current  job,  initially  as  an  unarmed  security  officer.  He  received  technical
training and became an armed special security officer in February 2017.  He has never
held a security clearance.
Applicant married in March 2006 and has two children, ages nine and four. He also
has had custody of his 18-year-old niece since 2013, because her parents are deceased.
(Tr. 25-26.)
The  SOR  alleges  ten  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $23,000.  The  debts  are
reflected in credit reports from December 2017 (GE 2) and August 2018 (GE 3), and court
records  reflecting  judgments  entered  against  Applicant  in  November  2017,  September
2013, and July 2011 (GE 5.)
In  2018,  Applicant  hired  a  financial  advisor  in  2018  to  devise  a  budget,  contact
creditors, and supervise his compliance with his budget and payment plans. (AE B.) He
pays her $250 every two weeks for her services. (Tr. 40-41.) He testified that she builds
up a “piggybank” that she uses to negotiate settlements. (Tr. 40-41.) Applicant testified
that he could obtain documentation of the amount of money in the “piggybank” and her
plan for settling his debts. (Tr. 47.) He did not submit any such documentation.
In February 2019, Applicant hired a law firm specializing in credit repair. He pays
the firm $100 per month. (Tr. 69-70.) The law firm sent out two “interventions,” demanding
information and validation of the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e and another debt not alleged
in the SOR. The firm also sent five “challenges” to the credit bureaus regarding the debts
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and1.h as well as another debt not alleged in the SOR. (AC C.)
Applicant’s  financial  advisor  submitted  the  answer  to  the  SOR  on  Applicant’s
behalf. She did not testify or participate in the hearing. The SOR answer included copies
of  letters  dated  August  29,  2018,  each  captioned  as  a  “Proposal  of  Settlement”  and
proposing monthly payments to the creditors alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.j.
On May 11, 2019, six days before the record closed, Applicant’s financial advisor
submitted  a  written  description  of  payments  and  payment  agreements  for  each  debt
alleged in the SOR, except the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f. Her submission indicates that
every debt alleged in the SOR is either resolved or is in the process of being resolved.
However, she submitted no documentation  to support her submission. She stated that
additional  documentation  was  forthcoming.  (AE  E.)  However,  the  record  contains  no
additional documentation. The evidence concerning the delinquent debts alleged in the
SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: deficiency of about $5,537 after vehicle repossession. Applicant
obtained a vehicle loan in August 2013, and the vehicle was repossessed in December
2013. (GE 4 at 2.) Applicant testified that he had documents showing that the debt was
paid in full, but he did not submit anything at the hearing. (Tr. 45.)  In her post-hearing
submission, Applicant’s financial advisor stated that this debt was paid in full. She did not
submit any documentation showing that the debt was resolved, but stated that she was
awaiting documentation and an order of satisfaction.
SOR  ¶  1.b:  credit-card  account  past  due  for  $199,  with  a  balance  of  $948.
Applicant’s financial advisor’s post-hearing submission stated that the balance had been
reduced to $240 and would be paid off in June 2019. She did not submit any evidence of
payments or the reduced balance.
SOR ¶ 1.c: credit-card account charged off for $430. At the hearing, Applicant
submitted evidence that his balance was $442, with a minimum payment of $103 due in
April  2019.  (AE  D.)  The  financial  advisor’s  post-hearing  submission  stated  that  the
creditor had agreed to settle the debt for $300 and that the balance due was $150. She
did not submit any documentation of a settlement agreement or any payments.
SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.e:  credit-card  account  charged  off  for  $338  and  line  of
credit charged off for $95. The financial advisor’s post-hearing submission stated that
these debts were paid in full, but her submission did not include any documentation of
payments. She stated that she was awaiting documentation from the creditors.
SOR ¶ 1.f: telecommunications account placed for collection of about $1,000.
The December 2017 credit report reflected that this debt was disputed. It was placed for
collection  in  December  2015.  (GE  3  at  3.)  Applicant  submitted  no  documentation  of
payments, payment agreements, or other resolution of this debt. However, the debt is not
reflected in the August 2018 credit report (GE 4.) Since the debt is too recent to have
“aged off” Applicant’s credit report under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, its absence from
the more recent credit report indicates that the dispute was resolved in Applicant’s favor.
SOR  ¶  1.g:  judgment  obtained  by  automobile  dealer  in  2000  for  $600.  The
financial advisor’s post-hearing submission stated that the creditor agreed to settle this
debt  for  $300,  had  accepted  a  payment  of  $50,  and  that  the  balance  is  $100.  She
submitted no documentation of a settlement agreement or payments.
SOR ¶ 1.h: judgment obtained by collection agency in 2017 for a deficiency
of $11,333 after an automobile repossession. Applicant purchased a van for his mother
in May 2015, and she helped him make the payments. His mother was injured in a vehicle
accident and could no longer drive or assist Applicant with the payments. He voluntarily
surrendered the vehicle when he could no longer afford the payments. (Tr. 31-32.) The
vehicle was repossessed in March 2017 and the judgment for the deficiency was entered
in November 2017. (GE 3 at 2; GE 5 at 1.) Applicant’s pay is being garnished for $175
every two-week pay period to satisfy the judgment. The balance due as of April 25, 2019
was $7,779. Interest continues to accrue on this judgment at $10%, which computes to
$2.11 per day on the principal amount. (AX A.) Applicant testified that the creditor is willing
to settle the debt for less than the full amount, and he hoped that his federal income tax
refund for a “few thousand” would allow him to settle the debt. (Tr. 33-34.) At the hearing,
Applicant submitted a letter from his financial advisor, explaining that garnishment left him
insufficient funds to pay other creditors. (AE B.)
SOR  ¶  1.i:  judgment  obtained  by  medical  provider  in  2013  for  $1,176.
Applicant co-signed the contract for this debt, incurred by his 76-year-old mother. (Tr. 34-
37.)  The  financial  advisor’s  post-hearing  submission  stated  that  the  creditor  agreed  to
settle  this  debt  for  $700,  to  be  paid  in  monthly  $100  installments.  She  submitted  no
documentation of a payment agreement or any payments.
SOR  ¶  1.j:  lien  obtained  by  fitness  club  in  2011  for  $1,457.  The  financial
advisor’s post-hearing submission stated that the creditor agreed to settle this debt for
$750,  to  be  paid  by  monthly  $50  payments.  She  submitted  no  documentation  of  a
payment agreement or any payments.
Applicant’s income varies between $3,300 and $4,200, depending on the number
of hours he works. He has a second job providing private security on Friday and Saturday
nights, and he earns about $600 per month. He is looking for a third job. (Tr. 70.) His wife
is employed and earns about $1,400 per month. (Tr. 48-49.) Applicant’s mother now lives
with his sister, and he sends his sister $500 to $700 every other month to  help defray
their living expenses. (Tr. 52.) Applicant’s niece is now in college and has a scholarship,
but he sends her money from time to time. (Tr. 53.)
