Applicant is a 45-year-old systems engineer for a defense contractor, employed
since  1997.  He  was  laid  off  for  three  months  in  2016,  and  four  months  in  2017.  He
previously held a DOD security clearance from 2007 to 2009. Applicant was awarded a
bachelor’s degree in 1997. He married in 2001 and has two children.
Applicant’s spouse was laid off in November 2008 and remained unemployed for
nine  months.  This  resulted  in  a  significant  decrease  in  household  income  during  the
period. In 2011, Applicant’s mother was diagnosed with dementia. He is her only child.
She moved in with Applicant’s family, and Applicant hired a private caregiver for her while
he and his spouse were at work or at the children’s events, costing about $800 per month.
He  eventually  was  able  to  place  his  mother  in  a  nursing  home,  and  continues  to  pay
$1,800 per month to subsidize her costs since February 2019. In August 2017, Applicant’s
home  was  severely  damaged  by  flooding  during  a  hurricane.  The  damage  was  not
covered  by  insurance,  but  the  federal  government  assisted  with  partial  repair  costs.
Applicant paid an additional $30,000 for repairs.
The SOR alleges under Guideline F, that Applicant has 14 delinquent consumer
and tax debts totaling about $18,700 and federal income tax debts for tax years 2012 to
2016 totaling about $24,300; and failing to file his 2012 to 2017 federal income tax returns
when due. Additionally, the SOR alleges under Guideline E, that Applicant failed to report
his  federal  income  tax  debts  and  failed  to  file  his  federal  2016  tax  return,  when  he
completed his SF-86 on May 30, 2017. Applicant generally admitted the SOR allegations
with explanations and corrections, and denied intentionally falsifying his SF-86.
SOR ¶ 1.a is a delinquent auto loan for a vehicle to which Applicant had two engine
replacements. Applicant allowed the vehicle to be voluntarily repossessed. The creditor
charged off the debt in 2015. Applicant negotiated a settlement on the debt in February
2019, and paid the agreed amount in full. The debt is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b is a delinquent apartment rent debt from 2016. Applicant negotiated a
payment  schedule,  beginning  in  February  2019.  He  has  made  consistent  monthly
payments since February 2019 per the agreement. This debt is being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c is a delinquent apartment debt from 2017. Applicant paid the debt in full
in February 2019. This debt is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.d is a small medical account. Applicant incorrectly believed the account
was covered by insurance. He paid the account in full, and the debt is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.e is a delinquent bank debt that became delinquent in 2016. Applicant
negotiated a settlement in April 2019 and paid the settlement in full. This debt is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.f is a phone company collection account. Applicant negotiated a monthly
installment  repayment  plan  in  February  2019,  and  has  made  scheduled  monthly
payments since March 2019. This debt is being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.g is a delinquent payday lender account. Applicant paid the account in
full in February 2019. The debt is resolved.
SOR  ¶¶  1.h  and  1.i  are  delinquent  telephone  utility  and  insurance  company
accounts that were paid in full in February and March 2019. These debts are resolved.
SOR  ¶¶  1.j  –  1.n  are  federal  income  tax  debts  from  tax  years  2012  to  2016.
Applicant was unable to completely pay taxes that were due as a result of the increased
household expenses for caring for his mother. He established a repayment plan with the
IRS  beginning  in  2013,  but  missed  a  payment  in  May  2017,  causing  the  plan  to  be
suspended.  Once  he  restarted  payments  in  June  2017,  the  plan  was  reinstated.  His
subsequent taxes owed were included in the plan, and Applicant has been compliant with
the terms of the plan. A substantial refund owed to Applicant for his tax year 2017 filing
was applied to the tax debt. These debts are being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.o alleges Applicant failed to file his federal tax returns for 2012 to 2017
when due, however, Applicant showed evidence that the returns were filed on time. This
allegation is resolved.
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges Applicant falsified his SF-86. Applicant did not report his federal
tax debts on his SF-86 because he was in an approved repayment plan with the IRS and
believed  that  the  tax  debts  were  no  longer  considered  delinquent.  Additionally,  he
provided evidence that his federal tax returns were submitted on time, as required.
Applicant’s  resolved  debts  no  longer  appear  on  his  most  recent  credit  report.
Applicant and his spouse now have a combined annual household income of $135,000,
and  he  has  over  $12,000  in  retirement  and  savings  accounts.  They  adhere  to  a  strict
budget, and his personal financial statement shows a substantial monthly net remainder.
He  has  not  had  financial  counseling,  but  through  the  assistance  of  his  counsel,  has
ensured that all SOR debts have been resolved or are in the process of resolution.
