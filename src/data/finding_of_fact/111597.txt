Applicant is 39 years old. She is single with one child. Applicant served on active
duty  with  the  United  States  Navy  for  15  years,  receiving  an  Honorable  Discharge  in
August 2013. She was unemployed for about 18 months after she left the service.  She
has  worked  for  several  government  contractors  since  February  2015.  She  wishes  to
obtain  national  security  eligibility  in  connection  with  her  employment  in  the  defense
industry. (Item 5 at Sections 13A, 15, and 17.)
Department  Counsel  submitted  fifteen  Items  in  support  of  the  SOR  allegations.
Item  15  is  inadmissible.  It  consists  of  summaries  of  unsworn  interviews  of  Applicant
conducted by various interviewers from the Office of Personnel Management on January
10, 2005; January 18, 2011; June 22, 2017;  and February 23, 2018. Applicant did not
adopt the summaries as her own statements, or otherwise certify them to be accurate.
Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.20,  these  Report  of  Investigation  (ROI)  summaries  are
inadmissible  in  the  Government’s  case  in  chief  in  the  absence  of  an  authenticating
witness. (See Executive Order 10865 § 5.) In light of Applicant’s admissions, Item 15 is
also  cumulative.  Applicant  is  not  legally  trained  and  might  not  have  understood
Department Counsel’s FORM commentary, which described the potential admissibility of
Item  15.  I  therefor  reviewed  it  for  any  potentially  mitigating  information  that  Applicant
might  have  thought  would  be  considered.  Any  such  mitigating  information  will  be
discussed later in this decision.
Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  she  has  failed  to  meet  her  financial  obligations  and  is  therefore  potentially
unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations with the exception of subparagraph 1.e, which
she denied. The total amount of money Applicant is alleged to owe in past-due debts is
approximately $22,300.
Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a and 1.b, which concern Applicant’s 2014,
2015, 2016, and 2017 Federal and state income tax returns. Applicant admitted that she
had not filed any of those tax returns in a timely fashion. In Section 26 of Item 5, which
concerns Applicant’s financial situation,  she stated that  her 2014 returns had not been
filed because, “I was unemployed at the time and I did not know I needed to do my taxes
for 2014 until I filed for 2015.” She further stated that, “I am in the process of gathering
the information I need from my unemployment agency to take back to H&R Block to have
them do my taxes for 2014.” (Item 5.)
Applicant also responded to interrogatories propounded on her by DOHA. In her
response, dated December 19, 2018, she again admitted not filing state or Federal tax
returns  for  tax  years,  2014  through  2017.  For  2014  and  2015  she  stated,  “I  was
unemployed.” For years 2016 and 2017 she stated, “I was unable to pay the price to get
them done due to bills accumulating. I still am trying to catch up and make payments. My
home  foreclosed  and  I’m  currently  living  in  an  apartment.”  She  also  submitted
documentation from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) confirming the fact that she had
not filed her Federal returns. (Item 6 at 6, 38-43.)
Allegations 1.c through 1.i concern Applicant’s past-due indebtedness. The current
status of the debts is as follows:
1.c. Applicant admitted owing $12,232 to a finance company for the balance due
on an automobile that was repossessed. Applicant stated in her interrogatories that she
was  making  payments  on  this debt. The  most  recent  credit  report in  the  record, dated
April 10, 2019, showed the debt as, “Redeemed or reinstated repossession.” In addition,
the report stated Applicant, “Pays account as agreed.” (Item 6 at 3, 8; Item 7 at 2.) This
debt is being resolved through payments.
1.d. Applicant admitted owing $2,228 to the Department of Veterans Affairs for a
past-due debt. Applicant did not supply any information showing that she had paid, or had
plans to pay, this debt. (Item 5 at Section 26; Item 6 at 3, 20, 21; Item 7 at 4.) This debt
is not resolved.
1.e. Applicant denied owing $365 for a past-due mobile phone bill stating, “It’s paid
off.” The  most  recent credit  report  in the  record  states,  “Account paid for less  than full
value. Paid collection.” (Item 7 at 3.) This debt is resolved.
1.f. Applicant admitted owing $2,310 to a condominium association for a judgment
entered  against  her  in  2015  for  unpaid  fees.  Applicant  no  longer  lives  at  the  property,
which was the subject of a foreclosure action. Applicant did not supply any information
showing that she had paid, or plans to pay, this debt. (Item 5 at Section 26; Item 6 at 4;
Item 9.) This debt is not resolved.
1.g. Applicant admitted owing $2,470 to a condominium association for a second
judgment  entered against  her in  2016 for unpaid fees.  Applicant  no  longer lives  at  the
property,  which  was  the  subject  of  a  foreclosure  action.  Applicant  did  not  supply  any
information showing that she had paid, or plans to pay, this debt. (Item 5 at Section 26;
Item 6 at 4; Item 10.) This debt is not resolved.
1.h. Applicant admitted owing $165.82 to a city treasurer’s office for a judgment
entered  against  her in  2016.  Applicant  submitted no  information  showing  that  she had
paid, or plans to pay, this debt. (Item 5 at Section 26; Item 11.) This debt is not resolved.
1.i. Applicant admitted owing $2,470 to a condominium association for a judgment
entered  against  her  in  2017  for  unpaid  fees.  Applicant  no  longer  lives  at  the  property,
which was the subject of a foreclosure action. Applicant did not supply any information
showing that she had paid, or plans to pay, this debt. (Item 5 at Section 26; Item 6 at 4;
Item 12.) This debt is not resolved.
Applicant submitted no documented financial information, such as a budget, from
which to make a conclusion that she is now financially stable. Applicant did not submit
any evidence concerning the quality of her job performance. She submitted no character
references  or  other  evidence  tending  to  establish  good  judgment,  trustworthiness,  or
reliability. I was unable to evaluate her credibility, demeanor, or character in person since
she elected to have her case decided without a hearing.
