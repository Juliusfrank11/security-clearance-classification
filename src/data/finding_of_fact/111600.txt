Applicant is a 61-year-old interim team lead who has performed the same type of
work  with  the  same  entity  for  about  a  year.  He  currently  earns  just  over  $100,000  a
year. Born and raised in the United States, Applicant has earned a bachelor’s degree in
statistics.  Married  in  2007,  Applicant  and  his  wife  have  three  children,  including  one
stepchild. He is committed to his spouse, who he describes as “way too cute” to divorce.
(Tr. 9) His wife teaches on an hourly basis at a Russian language and studies program.
Applicant  lives  within  his  means,  owns  an  unencumbered  $250,000  rental
property yielding a monthly profit of about $900, and maintains both a retirement and an
investment account. He does not “have to dip into” either of those accounts. (Tr. 26-27)
He  has  a  mortgage  balance  of  about  $244,000  on  a  property  with  a  market  value  in
excess  of  $600,000.  He  pays  a  monthly  mortgage  payment  on  that  home  of  $2,000.
One of his two cars has a modest monthly payment due, a payment of $300 toward its
purchase  plan.  He  and  his  family  are  settled  in  their  neighborhood.  Applicant  has  not
received credit counseling. (Tr. 38)
Applicant’s  wife  has  a  future  interest  in  an  apartment  in  Ukraine  owned  by  her
63-year-old  mother.  The  apartment  is  expected  to  pass  in  equal  halves  to  both
Applicant’s  wife  and  her  brother.  It  is  believed  the  total  value  of  the  property  is  about
$25,000-$30,000, making Applicant’s wife’s share worth about $12,500-$15,000 before
taxes  or  fees.  (PHE  14)  While  Applicant  has  not  been  to  Ukraine  since  his  2007
marriage,  his  wife  and  children  spent  about  two  months  there  in  the  summer  of  2018.
The wife regularly spends about two months in Ukraine each summer. (Tr. 44)
Applicant’s  mother-in-law  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Ukraine.  She  is  a  retired
factory worker. She has not served in the Ukrainian or Russian military or government.
Applicant’s wife sends money to her mother. Applicant does not know the exact extent
of his wife’s current largess in terms of her payments to her mother. (Tr. 39) Before his
wife  started  working  and  earning  her  own  income,  however,  Applicant  would  send  his
mother-in-law  about  $200  a  month.  (Tr.  39)  This  mother-in-law  recently  spent
approximately five months in the United States with Applicant and his wife.  Otherwise,
Applicant has periodic exchanges with her when she Skypes or phones with Applicant’s
wife, exchanges that take place weekly.
Applicant’s 46-year-old brother-in-law has not visited the United States. Although
he  is believed  to  still  be  a  citizen  of  Ukraine,  he  has  spent the  last  decade  residing  in
Russia.  (Tr. 40)  His  contact  with  Applicant  is  minimal,  limited  to birthday  calls.  Neither
speaks the other’s language. (Tr. 41) Applicant’s wife speaks with her brother “no more
than” once a month. (Tr. 41) This sibling has never worked for the Ukrainian or Russian
government. (Tr. 48) He is a salesman for a private firm.
The father of Applicant’s eldest child, who lives with Applicant and his wife in the
United  States,  lives  in  Ukraine.  This  teen  has  occasional  contact  with  her  biological
father  when  she  is  in  Ukraine.  The  ex-spouse’s  obligation  to  pay  child  support  was
waived in exchange for letting the girl move to the U.S. after Applicant and his wife wed.
For  tax  years  (TY)  2013-2017,  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  Federal  and  state
income  tax  returns.  This  failure  was  the  result  of  “pure  procrastination.”  (Tr.  30)
Applicant was aware the returns had to be filed by mid-April of each year or a request
for an extension  had to  be  submitted,  but  his  focus  was  elsewhere.  Although  he  does
not have a “specific record,” such tax return filing failures are not new;  he volunteered
that earlier TY return omissions “probably occurred.” (Tr. 37) When later asked whether
he was testifying that he had not timely filed returns for TY 2007-2012, Applicant stated:
“I’m testifying that the timely filing of taxes was inconsistent for all that. . . . There may
have been on-time filings. I couldn’t tell you whether there were or not.” (Tr. 38)
Evidence  was  offered  showing  that  the  following  delinquent  TY  returns  were
prepared, although only the Federal return for TY 2016 is signed by Applicant. (Ex. B)
The  copy  of  Applicant’s  complete  Federal  TY  2017  tax  return  is  unsigned.  (Ex.  C)  A
2018  bill for Federal taxes  due for TY  2014 for $1,235.19  was  presented along  with a
copy of Applicant’s un-transacted check in that amount. (Ex. D)
The  evidence  presented  after  the  hearing  are  copies  of  a  tax  preparer’s  forms
designed  for  electronic  transmittal.  No  direct  documentary  evidence  was  provided
showing that they were filed. The only evidence of taxes paid were copies of checks for
TY 2017 state taxes owed and an April 2019 check paying his Federal obligation from
2017 (see Exs. H-P). In sum, the evidence submitted here shows:
TY  2013  –  Federal  return  prepared  in  2017  with  $841  refund;  state  filing
presented, reflecting $340 refund;
TY  2014  –  Federal  return  prepared  in  2018;  state  filing  presented,  reflecting
$114 refund.
TY  2015  –  Federal  return  prepared  in  April  2019  showing  $2,679  owed;  state
filing presented, reflecting $367 owed;
TY 2016 – Federal return prepared in April 2019; state filing presented, reflecting
refund of $1,175;
TY  2017  –  Federal  return  prepared  in  April  2019  with  payment  of  $1,763;  state
filing presented, reflecting $752 owed.
Notice
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  following  facts:  Ukraine,  formerly  part  of  the
later dismantled Union of Socialist Soviet Republics (USSR), is a republic with a semi-
presidential  political  system.  In  2014,  the  Ukrainian  parliament  approved  a  new
government, which caused Russia to respond by seizing Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula.
Additional  unrest  occurred  in  2014,  involving  thousands  of  pro-Russian  protesters  in
eastern  and  southern  Ukraine.  In  2015,  a  ceasefire  agreement  established  a  de  facto
dividing  line  between  Ukrainian  government-controlled  and  separatist-held  areas  in
Ukraine. (GX 5.) Relations between the countries are strained.
