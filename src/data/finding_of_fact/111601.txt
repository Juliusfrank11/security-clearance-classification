The SOR alleges that Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in July
2008,  and  his  nonpriority  unsecured  debts  were  discharged  totaling  about  $216,000
(mostly  in  credit  card  debts)  in  October  2008,  and  that  he  subsequently  acquired  two
delinquent  accounts  that  were  charged  off  (¶¶  1.a,  owing  $36,364,  and  1.b,  owing
$26,858), totaling $64,222. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations and submitted
comments  in  mitigation.  His  SOR  admissions,  and  those  at  the  hearing,  are
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I
make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  55-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  is  a  1984  high
school graduate. He last attended college around 1995, and has completed about two
years  of  college  courses,  but  they  are  insufficient  for  a  college  degree.  Applicant
married in 2001. He and his wife have three children and eight grandchildren.
Applicant  served  honorably  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  between  1985  and  October
1988. After his discharge, he joined the National Guard where he apparently served two
years. He possessed a secret clearance while on active duty that was continued into his
National Guard service, and then, it was continued when he started to work for federal
contractors  to  present.  He  believes  that  his  clearance  was  upgraded  to  top  secret  in
about 2017. (Tr. 9)
Applicant’s  work  history  indicates  he  worked  for  a  private  company  between
March 2001 and March 2002. He was laid off in March 2002 and was unemployed until
March 2003. He worked for private companies between March 2003 and January 2008.
He  worked  as  a  recruiter  specialist  for  a  military  service  between  January  2008  and
November 2008. He was unemployed, in between contracts, between November 2008
and  January  2009.  A  federal  contractor  hired  him  as  an  information  technology  (IT)
specialist between January 2009 and October 2010. He was unemployed for about five
months between October 2010 and February 2011.
Applicant  worked  for  two  federal  contractors  between  February  2011  and
September 2012, and was deployed as a field engineer in support of U.S. personnel in
the  Middle  East.  He  was  unemployed  between  September  2012  and  January  2013.
Apparently, he took a break on his employment after he returned from an overseas tour
to  study  for  certifications  required  for  his  employment.  (GE  4)  He  worked  for  federal
contractors  in  the  United  States  and  was  deployed  to  the  Middle  East  twice  between
November 2014 and March 2016, and then from August 2016 to December 2016. (Tr.
58-60) He was hired as a senior field technician by his current employer and clearance
sponsor, a federal contractor, in January 2017. He is currently deployed to Europe.
Concerning  his  financial  problems,  Applicant  credibly  explained  that  he  was  a
victim  of  the  2007  –  2008  financial  crisis.  He  and  his  wife  purchased  their  primary
residence  in  2002  -  2003.  Before  the  2007  -  2008  financial  crisis,  he  purchased  three
investment properties, fixed them, and sold them for a profit of about $270,000. He used
the profit to purchase a five-acre property with a plan to build a home for himself and his
aging in-laws.
Applicant  secured  a  $490,000  construction  loan from  a mortgage company  and
started building his home. In mid-2007, the construction of the house was half complete
when  the  mortgage  company  declared  bankruptcy.  He  tried  to  obtain  another
construction loan, but was unsuccessful. He used his credit cards in an attempt to finish
the  construction  of  the  house,  but  failed.  Applicant  had  to  short-sell  the  five-acre
property  and  took  a  financial  loss.  Applicant  had  the  foresight  to  never  mortgage  his
primary residence as collateral for the new construction and was able to keep it after the
bankruptcy discharge. (Tr. 31-39; AE 6 provides some evidence of profit from the sale
of one property.)
Concerning  SOR  ¶  1.a,  Applicant  explained  that  he  purchased  a  $35,000
motorhome  in  December  2016,  after  coming  back  from  a  deployment  to  Afghanistan.
He believed that the purchase would allow him to spend more time with his wife while in
the  United  States.  He  was  scheduled  to  attend  training  in  two  different  states  for  long
periods,  and  was  scheduled  to  deploy  again  after  the  completion  of  his  training.
Applicant planned on living in the motorhome with his family, and to sell his home ahead
of  his  upcoming  deployment.  However,  his  wife  is  a  postal  worker  employee  who  is
receiving worker’s compensation since 1999. She was concerned about losing her long-
time  doctor  and  refused  to  move  or  travel  with  Applicant.  He  attempted  to  sell  the
motorhome  without  success,  and  when  he  could  no  longer  afford  the  payments,  he
voluntarily returned the motorhome to the lender.
Applicant’s  documentary  evidence  shows  that  he  made  payments  on  the
motorhome  note  between  December  2016  and  December  2017.  He  contacted  the
creditor  in  March  2018,  and  attempted  to  set  up  a  payment  plan.  The  manager  of  the
credit union indicated that he would agree to a payment plan provided Applicant’s credit
card balance was below $5,000. At that time, Applicant’s credit card balance was about
$13  -  14,000,  because  of  expenses  required  for  repairs  to  his  primary  home  resulting
from  a  leaking  roof  and  mold  issues.  It  took  Applicant  until  October  2019  to  lower  the
balance on the credit card to about $3,000.
In September 2019, the credit union offered Applicant several payment  options.
In  December  2019,  consistent  with  the  offer,  Applicant  established  a  $374  monthly
electronic payment to resolve this debt. (AE 13)
Concerning  SOR  ¶  1.b,  Applicant  explained  that  he  opened  a  bank  account  in
November  2015  for  a  long-time  friend,  and  gave  his  friend  access  to  two  credit-card
accounts because he was pending a divorce and needed financial assistance. Applicant
believed his friend would repay any charges he made in the accounts. During two years,
Applicant provided financial support to his friend, who overcharged the account alleged
in SOR ¶ 1.b. In a sworn statement, the friend admitted the account was his debt. He
has continued to promise to repay the debt, but he does not have the financial means to
repay it. (AE 5; Tr. 40-46)
Appellant made three payments on this account after it was closed  by the credit
union, and he contacted the credit union personnel three times hoping they would open
the account and let him make payments, but to no avail. If the creditors agree, Applicant
intends to pay the charged-off accounts one at a time.
Applicant  expressed  remorse  for  his  financial  situation.  He  claimed  that  he  has
learned  a  hard  lesson  and  promised  to  be  financially  responsible  in  the  future.  He
believes  that  his  overall  financial  situation  is  good.  He  is  never  late  on  his  mortgage
payments, and his earnings are sufficient for him to pay his living expenses and current
debts.  Applicant  believes  he  is doing  the best  he  can  do  in  his current  circumstances.
He is concerned about not getting his clearance, losing his job, and having to repay his
employer for his current relocation expenses to Europe that are close to $100,000.
Applicant’s 2018 credit report (GE 8) shows a total of 31 “trades” with 29 trades
in good standing. The only derogatory trades concern the accounts alleged in SOR  ¶¶
1.a and 1.b.
