Applicant is 56 years old, and has four adult children. He and his first wife divorced
in February 2014, after almost 25 years of marriage. He remarried in December 2016. He
earned a high school diploma in 1983, a licensed practical nurse (LPN) diploma in 1992,
and an online associate’s degree in 2014. He first enlisted in the National Guard in 1984,
and retired from the U.S. Army with an honorable discharge in December 2006 as a staff
sergeant (pay grade E-6). He held a Secret clearance during most of his enlisted service.
He began his current employment as a medical training project lead with a major defense
services  contractor  in  March  2015,  and  applied  for  a  trustworthiness  determination  in
connection with that position. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3; AE J; Tr. 7, 39, 54-57.)
Following his retirement from the Army, Applicant worked as a civilian federal (GS)
employee at a major military hospital from April 2007 to October 2008, from April 2009 to
November 2014, and again from June 2015 to May 2016. From November 2008 to April
2009 he worked at the same hospital as a medical trainer but was employed by a defense
contractor. Applicant voluntarily left his GS position in November 2014 under unfavorable
circumstances after some workplace incidents. After being rehired in June 2015, he was
fired by the hospital in May 2016 for missing too many days of work without justification.
He  was  unemployed  from  February  to  June  2015,  taking  “time  off”  after  his  previous
contract position ended; and again from May 2016 to September 2016, after being fired
from his GS hospital job. He reported that during both brief unemployment periods he,
“was supported financially from his military disability pay and military retirement … [and
he] had no problems from not working.” (GE 1; GE 3; Tr. 57.)
Applicant largely attributed the absenteeism that led to his May 2016 dismissal, as
well as his financial mismanagement and memory problems, to some unspecified service-
related injuries and a more recent head injury he received on July 4, 2015. One of the
guests at a neighborhood family barbecue party that Applicant hosted that evening struck
him with a beer bottle as he intervened in an alcohol-fueled altercation. Applicant provided
documentation showing that his assailant was convicted of Malicious Mischief in the First
Degree and Assault in the Fourth Degree on April 29, 2016, after she pled guilty for her
part  in  the  altercation.  During  the  evening  of  July  7,  2015,  Applicant  went  to  the
emergency room at the military hospital, where he had just resumed working, complaining
of headaches from this incident. He was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome and
lacerations to his face, and received pain medications. (Answer; AE E; AE F; AE G; AE
H; Tr. 58-63, 75-76.)
As  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  2.a,  Applicant  falsely  responded,  “No,”  to  the  question  in
Section 26 of his May 12, 2017 e-QIP, which asked whether he had any delinquencies
involving  routine  financial  accounts  during  the  past  seven  years.  In  fact,  he  had  six
delinquent personal loans  or credit  card  accounts,  as  described  in  detail  below,  which
exceeded $90,000. (GE 1; GE 4; GE 8.)
About five weeks later, on June 20, 2017, Applicant completed, certified as true,
and filed a federal court petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief. (SOR ¶ 1.g.) All six of
the delinquencies alleged in the SOR were listed on Schedule E/F of that petition, which
included  a  total  of  $124,964  in  nonpriority  unsecured  debts.  Schedules  I  and  J  of  the
petition declared that his monthly income and expenses were, respectively, $6,388 and
$5,537; yielding a monthly net income of $851. Applicant changed his mind about making
the  payments  necessary  to  obtain  bankruptcy  relief,  and  his  case  was  dismissed  on
September 19, 2017. (Answer; GE 3; GE 8; AE A; AE D; Tr. 77-78.)
On December 1, 2017, Applicant enrolled in a debt resolution program (DRP) with
a national for-profit debt-relief company to address his delinquencies. He testified that he
makes fixed monthly payments of $1,543 to this company under his DRP, for their use in
negotiating  and  paying  settlements  of  his  delinquencies.  He  implied,  but  did  not
document, that he made all of those payments. At that rate he would have paid $37,032
through November 2019 to the company. His September 2019 Program Summary from
the company shows an account balance of $910 and, as detailed below, the company
reported total payments of $7,504 toward his delinquent accounts. There is no information
concerning the $28,618 difference between the $37,032 paid into the DRP and the $8,414
paid out or retained for future payments by the company. (GE 3; AE A; AE I.; Tr. 83.)
An  investigator  for  the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  conducted  a
personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  of  Applicant  on  April  12,  2018.  The  interview  was
conducted, by mutual agreement, in the dining area of a public coffee house. Applicant
said that this arrangement made it uncomfortable for him to discuss derogatory personal
information and that the interviewer seemed somewhat accusatory and unprofessional.
(Answer; Tr. 36-39.) He later reviewed the interviewer’s summary of the PSI and provided
some corrected information. (GE 3.)
Applicant told the interviewer supplemental information to update many of his e-
QIP  answers  concerning  his  contact  information,  his  education,  his  employment  and
military histories, and his family members. When the issue of his financial considerations
was discussed, he first told the interviewer that he had begun credit counseling and debt
consolidation through his DRP, and was paying them $1,500 per month for their use in
resolving his personal loans and credit card debts. He then, reportedly, “confirms that he
has no delinquent accounts that should have been reported on the case papers and the
accounts being handled by [the DRP] would not pertain to the financial questions asked.”
(GE 3 at 4-8.)
The interviewer then confronted Applicant with information from his credit bureau
report (CBR) concerning eight delinquent debts, including the six that were subsequently
alleged in the SOR. He said that one small collection account had been fully repaid in
2017, and that the other seven were being handled in his DRP. He  acknowledged and
explained details concerning each of these eight delinquent debts to the interviewer, and
said each one was not listed on his e-QIP, “due to oversight,” when asked about them
individually.  After discussing  his dismissed bankruptcy  petition  with  the  interviewer, he
told her that he:
stopped making payments on all the above accounts when he thought he’d
file  for  bankruptcy  which  was  in  early  2017  which  is  why  the  accounts
became  delinquent  and  some  were  sent  to  collections  for  non-payment.
[He] thought it would all be resolved with the bankruptcy however he then
decided not to file. [He] did not list each account on the case papers due to
oversight and agrees with all the confronted information.
(GE 3 at 8-10.)
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed that he was unaware of delinquent
debts  when  he  completed  his  e-QIP  because  he  thought  all  of  his  bills  were  being
automatically paid by his bank. He claimed that he was not aware of his delinquencies
until they were brought to his attention during the April 2018 interview, then once he “had
been made aware of how bad the situation was [he] took corrective action went to a lawyer
filed a Chapter 13.” He said that when he became aware that he would only be able to
keep about $400 a month for many years under the Chapter 13 plan he filed to dismiss
that, and later entered into his DRP. However, he could not explain  during his hearing
why he said he was unaware of his delinquencies until the OPM PSI in April 2018, when
he had filed the bankruptcy petition involving those debts shortly after certifying the false
e-QIP, then entered the DRP to resolve them, both of which took place in 2017 while he
said he did not know they were delinquent. (Answer; Tr. 74-82.)
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges that Applicant violated a 300-foot restraining order, contained
in the 2014 Decree of Dissolution of his marriage to his first wife, at least twice during
February 2016 by accosting her in her place of employment. At the time, they both worked
at the major military hospital discussed above. There is no record evidence detailing any
such incidents, and Applicant denied that any of their communications during that period
were not mutually consensual. Department Counsel introduced a copy of the Decree in
question,  which  specifically  excludes  encounters  at,  “their  mutual  place  of  work,”  from
application  of  the  order’s  300-foot  restriction.  This  SOR  allegation  is  without  merit.
(Answer; GE 2; Tr. 89-92.)
The following subparagraphs describe the origin and status of each of Applicant’s
six  SOR-alleged  debts,  which  totaled  $90,482  and  became  delinquent  during  2016  or
early 2017. These findings are based on the information contained in Applicant’s answer
to the SOR; his October 5, 2018 interrogatory response adopting and supplementing the
report of his OPM PSI; the record CBRs; Applicant’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition; and
status documents from his DRP. (Answer; GE 3 through GE 8; AE I.)
SOR ¶ 1.a: Applicant opened this $50,000 unsecured personal loan from
an  online  personal finance  company  in  November  2015.  His  payments  became
delinquent  in  December  2016,  and  the  lender  charged  off  the  past-due  loan
balance of $46,375 after his last payment in March 2017. The debt is “enrolled” in
Applicant’s DRP, with no reported settlement amount. His most recent (May 2019)
record CBR shows no payments and an outstanding balance due of $46,375. This
debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b: Applicant opened this $35,000 unsecured personal loan from a
major financial institution in July 2012. His payments became delinquent in March
2017  and  the  lender  reported  charging  off  the  $19,878  past-due  balance  in
December 2017, after dismissal of his bankruptcy plan. Applicant’s DRP reported
an agreed settlement amount of $8,675 for this account, with “Payments Pending.”
There is no evidence of actual payments having been made to this creditor. This
debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c: Applicant also opened this $15,000-limit credit card account with
the major financial institution in July 2012. He made his last timely payment toward
the  account  in  October  2016,  and  the  lender  charged  off  the  $16,096  past-due
balance in May 2017. Applicant’s DRP reported an agreed settlement amount of
$7,244  for  this  debt,  and  that  payments  of  this  amount  were  complete  as  of
September  2019.  His  May  2019  CBR  showed  receipt  of  an  unspecified  partial
payment to this account  in April 2019, and a past-due balance of $11,896. This
debt is probably resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.d:  Applicant  opened  this  $5,000-limit  credit  card  account  with  a
different bank in May 2015. His payments became delinquent in March 2016 and
he made his last payment toward this debt in September 2016. The lender charged
off  the  $5,346  past-due  balance  in  late  2017  or  early  2018,  after  dismissal  of
Applicant’s bankruptcy plan. Although Applicant said during his OPM PSI that this
debt was included in, and being actively repaid through, his DRP, that claim was
incorrect. When asked during the hearing to clarify the situation, he claimed that
he had reached out to the bank and was told that he did not have to worry about it
anymore since it was charged off. He could not recall receiving documentation of
this,  or  an IRS  Form 1099-C  forgiving  this  debt.  He  did not pay  any  associated
income taxes if the debt was forgiven, and did not submit pertinent documentation
while the record remained open after his hearing so he could locate it. (Tr. 70-73;
AE J; AE K.) This debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.e: Applicant opened this $2,000-limit credit card account with the
major financial institution in October 2015. He made his last timely payment toward
the account in September 2016, and it was closed by the lender in January 2017.
The $2,331 past-due balance was charged off in October 2017, after dismissal of
the bankruptcy plan. The debt is “enrolled” in Applicant’s DRP, with no reported
settlement amount. His May 2019 CBR shows no payments and an outstanding
balance due of $2,331. This debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.f: Applicant opened this $300-limit account with a major credit card
company in April 2016. He made his last payment toward the already delinquent
account in September 2016, and it was subsequently placed for collection with a
past-due balance of $456. Applicant’s DRP reported an agreed settlement amount
of $260 for this $502 debt, and that payments of this amount were complete as of
March 2019. His July 2018 CBR showed receipt of an unspecified partial payment
by  the  debt  collection  agency  in  satisfaction  of  this  account,  and  it  no  longer
appears on his May 2019 CBR. This debt is resolved.
An  Army  major who  served  with  Applicant in  various  capacities  between  2000
and 2012, and remains in contact, wrote a letter praising Applicant’s medical knowledge,
composure,  leadership,  trustworthiness,  and  professionalism.  While  on  active  duty,
Applicant earned three Meritorious Service Medals, six Army Achievement Medals, six
Army  Good  Conduct  Medals,  and  various  expeditionary  or  service  awards.  His  NCO
Evaluation Reports for his final three years of service reflected excellent performance in
various capacities at two military hospitals. In November 2012, he was selected to join
the Order of Military Medical Merit, in recognition of his many significant contributions to
the  U.S.  Army  Medical  Department.  It  is,  “a non-profit  organization  that  depends  upon
[the participation of its members] to keep it viable.” (AE J; AE K.)
