Applicant is almost 34, single, and has no children. He was the valedictorian of his
high school class. In 2008, he received a bachelor’s degree in philosophy and aerospace
engineering. In 2010, he received a master’s degree in aerospace engineering. Applicant
received prestigious grants to attend both universities, which are among the best in the
United  States.  Since  December  2015,  he  has  worked  as  a  research  engineer  for  a
defense  contractor  at  a  research  facility.  He  applied  for  his  first  security  clearance  in
March 2017. (GE 1; Tr. 14-23)
Applicant admitted, with explanation, all of the SOR allegations, including: using
and  purchasing  3,4-methylenedioxy-mehtaphetamine  (MDMA)  between  January  and
August 2017; selling one MDMA pill in May 2017; and using marijuana in 2011, 2012, and
2016. He also admitted to falsifying his March 2017 SCA and making false statements
during his October 2017 personal subject interview (PSI).
On March 1, 2017, Applicant submitted his SCA, and he disclosed no involvement
with illegal drugs. When he completed the SCA, he understood that it was important to
tell  the  truth.  He  did  not  disclose  his  drug  use  because  he  was  concerned  that  any
disclosure  of  drug  use  would  prevent  him  from  obtaining  government  employment,  in
particular because he is a minority. He also felt pressure to complete the SCA quickly.
(Answer; GE 1 at 39-40; Tr. 26-28, 45-48, 51-52)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  October  2017,
November  2017,  and  May  2018.  During  his  first  PSI  on  October  20,  2017,  Applicant
affirmatively denied any drug use. In doing so, he failed again to disclose his illegal drug
involvement, and he also provided false information to the investigator. (GE 1 at 39-40;
GE 2 at 2-3, 9)
Applicant testified that he did not appreciate or understand the seriousness of the
security clearance process until his initial interview in October 2017. He explained that
after  the  initial  interview,  he  conducted  research  regarding  lying  in  a  SCA  and  during
government interviews. He then realized that drug use and lying in SCAs is a “big deal.”
(Tr. 28-31)
On November 15, 2017, Applicant called the investigator and requested that the
investigator  not  contact  his former  girlfriend. She  was  a  listed  contact  in  his SCA, and
they  had  recently  ended  their  relationship.  Applicant  was  concerned  about  what  she
would say about him and how it could hurt his chances of obtaining a security clearance.
The investigator told Applicant that because his girlfriend was listed as a source in his
SCA, interviewing her was not optional. (GE 2 at 11-12, Tr. 53-57, 76)
Two days after his request to the investigator, Applicant called the investigator and
confessed to using drugs, failing to disclose his drug use, and asked for a subsequent
interview. Several days later, on November 21, 2017, Applicant was re-interviewed by the
investigator.  He  disclosed  that  he  used  marijuana  once  in 2011 and  once  in  2012.  He
also consumed edible marijuana in the spring of 2016. All of his marijuana use occurred
at parties. He also disclosed that in early 2017, he purchased MDMA pills from a website
because he was interested in neuroscience and the affect MDMA has on the brain. He
used  MDMA  5  to  10  times,  and  sold  an  MDMA  pill  one  time  at  a  party  in  May  2017.
Applicant told the investigator that his drug use was not habitual or detrimental to his life,
and that he did not think he had to disclose it.  During a subsequent PSI in May 2018,
Applicant disclosed that he used MDMA from early 2017 until the summer of 2017. (GE
2 at 13-14, 17-18; Tr. 33-35, 53-57, 68)
In October 2018, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories regarding his drug
use. He certified the accuracy (with one minor change) of all three of his PSIs. He also
completed a worksheet, in which he claimed that he used marijuana only one time, and
affirmed that he used MDMA 5 to 10 times in 2017. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. 58)
At the hearing, Applicant initially acknowledged that he used marijuana only one
time in 2012, and that he used MDMA only 3 to 4 times in 2017. Additionally, for the first
time, he claimed that all of his MDMA use occurred after he completed his SCA in March
2017, and therefore, he did not fail to disclose his MDMA use in his SCA. Upon further
questioning, he admitted purchasing 10 MDMA pills, using MDMA 4 times with his former
girlfriend  and  once  by  himself  at  a  party,  and  using  marijuana  a  total  of  three  times.
Applicant claimed the discrepancy regarding his marijuana use was due to forgetfulness
and was unintentional. He asserted that he decided to experiment with MDMA due to his
educational background in neuroscience and philosophy. (Tr. 32-36, 49-51, 58, 66)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  maintained  that  he  continued  to  use  MDMA  after  he
completed his SCA, because he wanted to try it, and “it was gone from his mind” that drug
use was inconsistent with holding a security clearance. However, he also acknowledged
that at the same time he was concerned that if his employer learned he had used drugs
his employment would be in jeopardy. As of the hearing, Applicant had not reported his
2016  marijuana  use  and  2017  MDMA  use  to  his  FSO  or  supervisor,  because  he  was
afraid it would negatively impact his ability to get a clearance, maintain his employment,
and damage his reputation. Applicant has not been subjected to any urinalyses through
his current employment, but his employer does have a policy prohibiting the use of illegal
drugs. (Tr. 44, 66-69, 76)
Applicant’s  supervisor,  who  submitted  a  letter  of  recommendation,  has  known
Applicant for four years in a professional capacity. His letter indicated he is aware that
Applicant used drugs approximately when he was in his early teens, but he is unaware
that Applicant used drugs since he has known him. Applicant’s supervisor recommended
him for a clearance. Additionally, Applicant submitted a letter of recommendation from a
friend. Both letters of recommendation described Applicant as responsible, reliable, and
trustworthy. (AE A; AE B; Tr. 23, 69)
Applicant testified that he has not used MDMA since the summer of 2017, because
his curiosity was satisfied, and he does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. He
has friends that continue to use marijuana, but he avoids being around them when they
use  drugs.  While  in  college,  Applicant  volunteered  as  a  tutor.  Applicant  is  currently
applying to become an Air Force Reserve Officer. (GE 2 at 15, 18; Tr. 38, 41-43)
