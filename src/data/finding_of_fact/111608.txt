The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to timely file federal income
tax  returns  for tax  years 2010  through  2017  (SOR  ¶  1.a);  owes $18,240 in delinquent
federal income taxes for tax years 2010 through 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.b); failed to file his state
income tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.c); owes $7,785 on a state
income tax lien filed against him in 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.d); owes judgment debts filed against
him in 2016 for $4,944 (SOR ¶ 1.e) and in 2017 for $3,954 (SOR ¶ 1.f); and owes charged-
off or collection debts on seven other accounts totaling $28,138 (SOR ¶¶ 1.g-1.m). Under
Guideline E, Applicant allegedly was terminated from federal employment in September
2014 following an investigation for time-and-attendance abuse from January 2012 through
at  least  January  2013  (SOR  ¶  2.a);  was  terminated  from  a  defense-contractor  job  in
approximately August 2015 for poor performance (SOR ¶ 2.b); falsified material facts on a
December 17, 2013 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (hereafter
SCA) by deliberately failing to disclose that he had failed to timely file federal income tax
returns for tax years 2010 through 2012 and owed delinquent income taxes (SOR ¶ 2.c);
and falsified material facts on a June 23, 2017 SCA by not disclosing his terminations from
federal employment (SOR ¶¶ 2.d and 2.e) and his federal-contractor employment (SOR ¶
1.f) and by denying whether, in the last seven years, he had failed to file or pay federal,
state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance (SOR ¶ 2.g). (Item 1.)
When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he admitted that he failed to timely
file federal and state income tax returns for the years alleged but added that all his federal
tax returns are filed. He admitted owing the federal and state income tax delinquencies,
explaining that he plans to establish payment arrangements for his federal taxes once he is
gainfully  employed.  He  admitted  owing  the  judgment  debts,  but  indicated  that  he  had
reduced the balance of the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.e to $1,500. He admitted defaulting on the
other accounts in the SOR except for the $8,041 allegedly owed the Defense Finance and
Accounting Service (DFAS) (SOR ¶ 1.h). Applicant admitted the Guideline E allegations,
but indicated that he was unjustly terminated from his federal employment and had filed an
appeal “to fight allegations” of being absent without leave and of conduct unbecoming a
federal employee; that his poor performance with a defense contractor was due to poor
training; and that his nondisclosure of his failure to file timely tax returns on his December
2013 SCA “was an oversight.” Applicant admitted without comment SOR ¶¶ 2.e and 2.f,
which respectively allege falsification of his June 2017 SCA for failing to disclose that he
had  been  fired  from  his  federal  and  defense-contractor  employments.  (Items  2-3.)
Regarding his negative response on his June 2017 SCA to the tax filing or tax payment
inquiry, Applicant’s initial response was “I admit. However, done by accident without intent.”
(Item 2.) In his supplemental response, Applicant simply answered, “I admit.” (Item 3.) After
considering the FORM, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant  is  52  years  old  and  unmarried.  There  is  no  evidence  in  the  record
indicating that he is currently employed. He seeks a security clearance so that he can work
as a “proprietary systems specialist” for a defense contractor, who continues to sponsor
him  for  a  security  clearance  despite  the  passage  of  more  than  two  years  since  he
submitted his SCA in June 2017. (Item 4.)
Applicant has taken some college classes but has yet to earn a college degree.
(Items 4-6.) He paid for his college classes in part with a federal student loan obtained for
$17,560 in January 2003. (Items 11-13.)
While working as a help-desk agent for a federal contactor, Applicant completed an
SCA on March 12, 2009. He reported financial delinquencies on three consumer credit
accounts totaling $1,769 and a $14,000 tax debt to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). He
indicated that he had arrangements in place to repay his smallest debt of $187 and his IRS
debt, and that he would establish repayment plans for his other credit-card delinquencies.
He indicated on his SCA that another department of the U.S. government had granted him
a confidential clearance in August 2007 (Item 6), which he now believes was a grant of
eligibility for a public trust position. (Item 7.)
In May 2010, Applicant resigned from his employment with a federal contractor to
work as a civilian information technology asset manager for the DOD in June 2010. (Items
4- 6.) In 2013, Applicant was investigated for claiming 200 work hours on his time sheets
between January 2012 and January 2013 that could not be accounted for. In approximately
May 2014, he was placed on administrative leave from his position with the DOD, and in
September 2014, he was involuntarily terminated for being absent without leave and for
conduct not becoming a federal employee (SOR ¶ 2.a). Applicant unsuccessfully appealed
his  termination  (Item  7),  and  in  April  2015,  the  DFAS  sought  to  recoup  $8,017  in
unspecified overpayments, most  likely wages to which he was not entitled. As of June
2017,  Applicant owed a collection balance of $8,041 to DFAS (SOR ¶ 1.h). (Item 13.)
Applicant denies any wrongdoing with regard to his time and attendance and disputes the
validity of the debt. (Items 2-3, 7.)
On December 17, 2013, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an
SCA on which he responded negatively to the following inquiry: “In the past seven (7)
years have you failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or
ordinance?” (SOR ¶ 2.c). (Item 5.) Available account transcripts from the IRS show that he
filed  his  federal  income  tax  return  for  tax  year  2010  in  December  2011,  after  the  IRS
inquired about his non-filing in November 2011. He was assessed a penalty of $251 in
February 2012 for late filing, and, in March 2013, the IRS issued a notice of intent to levy
for nonpayment of taxes owed. IRS records also show that he had not yet filed his federal
income tax returns for tax years 2011 and 2012 as of his December 2013 SCA. Applicant
was apparently granted a DOD top secret clearance in March 2014. (Items 4, 7.)
After he was fired from his federal employment in September 2014, Applicant was
unemployed through May 2015. In June 2015, he began working as a service-desk analyst
with a defense contractor. (Item 4.) In August 2015, he was involuntarily terminated from
that job for unsatisfactory performance. (Item 7.)
Applicant was unemployed from September 2015 to February 2016. He supported
himself on his savings and unemployment compensation. (Item 7.) Applicant worked as a
contract  service-desk  analyst  from  February  2016  to  August  2016,  when  his  contract
ended, and the company decided to hire a different contractor. Applicant supported himself
on savings and on unemployment compensation received from at least November 2016
through April 2017. In June 2017, Applicant received a job offer from a defense contractor
contingent on him obtaining a DOD security clearance. (Item 7.)
On June 23, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an SCA.
Regarding the employment inquiries, Applicant stated that his federal employment ended
for the following reason:  “My Contract had ended for my agreement.” He responded “No”
to inquiries concerning whether he had been fired from that employment; quit after being
fired; left by mutual agreement following charges of allegation of misconduct; or left by
mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance (SOR ¶ 2.d). He also
responded “No” to an inquiry concerning whether he had received a written warning, been
officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in that job (SOR ¶ 2.e). As
to why he lost his job with a federal contractor in August 2015, Applicant stated that he left
because his contract ended, and he denied that he was fired; quit after being told that he
would be fired; left by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct; or
left by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance (SOR ¶ 1.f). (Item
4.)
Applicant  also  responded  “No”  on  his  June  2017  SCA  to  an  inquiry  concerning
whether he had failed to file or pay federal, state, or other taxes within the last seven years
(SOR ¶ 1.g). (Item 4.) Available IRS account transcripts reflect Applicant had belatedly filed
his federal income tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2012, but he had not filed his
federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2014,  2015,  or  2016  as  of  June  2017.  His
delinquent federal income tax returns for those tax years were filed late in October 2017.
(Item 7.) No account transcript was submitted for tax year 2013, although Applicant admits
that he filed late for that tax year. (Items 2-3.) Applicant did not disclose on his June 2017
SCA a state tax lien of $7,785 (SOR ¶ 1.d) that was filed against him on April 13, 2016.
(Item 8.)
On  his  June  2017  SCA,  Applicant  indicated  that  a  financial  judgment  of
approximately $3,000 had been entered against him in December 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.f) after
he fell behind on his payments due to unemployment. He explained that he had set up
payment arrangements for the debt. (Item 4.) Available court records show that a judgment
was filed against Applicant by the creditor in November 2016 and that a consent judgment
was entered for $3,880 in August 2017. (Item 10.) Applicant also listed on his June 2017
SCA three other delinquencies of $900 (SOR ¶ 1.j), $6,000 (SOR ¶ 1.g), and $500 (not
alleged in SOR) that he indicated he would begin to repay when he started working. (Item
4.)  Applicant  did  not  disclose  on  his  SCA  that  a  $4,347  affidavit  judgment  had  been
entered against him in January 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.e). (Item 9.)
As of June 30, 2017, Applicant owed  two consumer-credit judgments of $4,459
(SOR ¶ 1.e) and $3,954 (SOR ¶ 1.f); charged-off balances of $13,388 on an unsecured
loan (not $6,000 as reported on his SCA) (SOR ¶ 1.g), $8,041 to the DFAS (SOR ¶ 1.h),
and  $2,254  on  a  credit-card  account  (SOR  ¶  1.i); and  collection  debts  of $1,090 on a
credit-card account (SOR ¶ 1.j), $306 for storage fees (SOR ¶ 1.m), and three medical
debts (not alleged in the SOR) of $101, $97, and $38. Applicant’s federal student-loan debt
had accrued to $40,517, and his account was rated as current. (Item 13.)
On December 19, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the  Office  of  Personnel Management  (OPM).  About  his employment history, Applicant
explained  that  he  was  unemployed  since  September  2016,  but  was  in  a  defense
contractor’s  system  “as  an  employee  awaiting  security  clearance  to  start  physically
working.” Applicant claimed that he left his defense-contractor employment in August 2015
after his contract ended and that he left his job with the DOD in September 2014 because
“he  did  not  interview  to  renew  employment  for  his  position”  and  that  the  position  was
moved to another location. Applicant denied that he had any difficulties with any of his
previous employers. When asked about the adverse financial information on his credit
record, Applicant did not deny the debts except for the DFAS debt, which he was disputing.
He claimed that his supervisor had signed off on his hours worked, and that the badge in-
and-out system was faulty. Applicant explained that he had some credit cards that spiraled
out of control, and that he obtained loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.g) to repay his debts but then
could not pay them. He attributed his delinquencies to unemployment and indicated that he
would begin to repay them once he began working. (Item 7.)
Applicant was interviewed by a different investigator for the OPM on January 31,
2018. He indicated that he had seasonal employment for two weeks in 2017 but that he
was  again  unemployed.  When  confronted  about  his  termination  from  his  defense-
contractor position in August 2015, Applicant stated that his supervisor would make him
work on tasks that were beyond his knowledge and familiarity, and he expressed his belief
that he should have received training. When asked to explain his removal from his DOD
position for being absent without leave and for conduct unbecoming a federal employee,
Applicant stated that the allegations were untrue and that he never would steal time from
an employer. He stated that he filed an appeal of his termination that was still pending. On
March 5, 2018, Applicant told the OPM investigator that he intends to file for bankruptcy to
address his “overwhelming” debts, and had completed pre-counseling sessions. (Item 7.)
The OPM investigator re-interviewed Applicant on May 24, 2018. Applicant reported
that he began working in retail in December 2017. He indicated that, due to oversight, he
had not disclosed on his June 2017 SCA that he had been terminated from his defense-
contractor  employment  in  August  2015.  He  explained  that  he  had  not  reported  the
circumstances or his termination on from his DOD employment because he wanted to
disclose the information in person to an investigator. (Item 7.)
On  June  8,  2018,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  another  OPM  investigator.
Regarding his finances, Applicant stated that he did not include all of his debts on his SCA
because he had only a handful of account statements, “was going by memory for the rest
of his debts,” and figured he would discuss the rest in person. Applicant indicated that he
was  still  disputing  the  DFAS  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.h). He  asserted  that  he  had  filed  a timely
appeal of his termination, but that his initial attorney “several months later” referred him to
another attorney, who told him it was too late to file an appeal. On June 13, 2018, the OPM
investigator obtained from Applicant “copies of documents pertaining to financial issue[s]
caused  by  employment  issue.”  (Item  7.)  Those  documents  were  not  included  with  the
FORM.
When re-interviewed on August 8, 2018, Applicant indicated that he was no longer
working for the retailer because he found another job. He did not provide any details about
his new employment or the date that he left his previous employer. When confronted by the
OPM investigator about the state tax lien filed against him in April 2016 for $7,785 (SOR ¶
1.d). Applicant acknowledged that he was aware of the lien  for unpaid state taxes and
explained that he had insufficient withholdings in 2012. He indicated that he had started
repayment with the state but then dropped the payment arrangements without informing
the state when he became unemployed. When he tried to reinstate the repayment in 2016,
the state demanded half of his tax debt, and he could not afford it. He stated that the
situation would not recur because he would make sure he had enough taxes withheld from
future earnings. (Item 7.)
By way of interrogatories, DOHA provided Applicant with summarized reports of his
interviews  with  the  OPM  investigators.  Applicant  affirmed  on  February  25,  2019,  the
summarized reports of his interviews with OPM investigators were accurate, and he made
no  corrections  or  comments  in  that  regard.  In  response  to  an  interrogatory  inquiry
concerning whether he had ever knowingly submitted an inaccurate time card or failed to
submit a leave form for time that he was not at work during his federal employment from
June 2010 through September 2010, Applicant answered “No” and added, “I have disputed
the  claims  alleged  against  me.  I  filed  an  appeal  in  October  of  2014.”  In  response  to
inquiries concerning whether he had failed to file federal and state income tax returns on
time, Applicant indicated that he had failed to timely file both federal and state returns for
tax  years  2015,  2016,  and  2017,  but  listed  only  “2018”  as  currently  unfiled.  Applicant
admitted that he owed back taxes to the IRS of $18,240 (SOR ¶ 1.b) for tax years 2010
through 2013, and that he owed back state taxes (no amount listed). He answered “No” to
whether he currently had any federal or state tax liens against him for delinquent taxes.
(Item 7.)
With  his  response  to  DOHA  interrogatories,  Applicant  submitted  IRS  account
transcripts  for  tax  years  2010  through  2012  and  2014  through  2017.  Relevant  tax
information as reported by the IRS is set forth in the following table.

In response to the March 29, 2019 SOR, Applicant indicated on May 11, 2019, that
all federal income tax returns had been filed through 2018. He admitted that he had not
timely filed state income tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2017 but did not indicate
whether those tax returns have been filed. He admitted that he owed past-due federal
income  taxes  of  $18,240  and  state  income  taxes  of  $7,785,  and  the  consumer-credit
delinquencies totaling $24,051 alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.f through 1.m. Applicant denied that he
owed the DFAS $8,041. He indicated with respect to the $4,944 judgment balance (SOR ¶
1.e) that he was repaying the debt “due to garnishment.” (Item 2.) Court records of the
judgment proceedings indicate that a writ of garnishment was issued for the debt in August
2018 and that the garnishee reported being employed as of October 1, 2018. (Item 9.) On
August 22, 2019, Applicant stated about the judgment debt that he now owes $1,500. (Item
3.) As of October 31, 2019, Equifax reported a $1,533 debt balance with the creditor and a
last payment in May 2019. No progress was being reported by Equifax on the consumer-
credit debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f through 1.l. The storage debt in collection in 2017 was no longer
on his credit report, but there is no evidence showing it has been paid. (Item 11.)
On  August  22,  2019,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  was  terminated  from  his  DOD
employment in 2014 and defense contractor employment in 2015, but contended that he
was unjustly terminated from his federal job and that poor training was a factor in the loss
of his defense-contractor employment. He admitted that he failed to disclose that he failed
to  timely  file  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2010,  2011,  and  2012  on  his
December 2013  SCA,  but  claimed  that  it  was “an oversight.” He admitted that he had
deliberately failed to disclose relevant information about his employment terminations and
about his delinquent tax returns and tax liabilities on his June 2017 SCA. (Item 3.)
Applicant also indicated on August 22, 2019, that he plans “to set up reasonable
payment arrangements [for his federal tax delinquency] once gainfully employed.” (Item 3.)
There is no evidence that Applicant has made any payments toward his past-due federal
and state income taxes. The record before me contains scant information about Applicant’s
income or expenses since 2017, so any reasonable assessment cannot be made as to
when Applicant will be able to address the outstanding delinquencies on his credit record.
