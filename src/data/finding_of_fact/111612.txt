Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant  did not timely file her
federal income tax returns for the 2010 – 2017 tax years; that although she had filed her
returns for 2010 – 2012 before the SOR was issued in 2019, she had yet to file her 2013
– 2017 returns (SOR 1.a). It also was alleged that as of January 9, 2019, Appellant had
not yet filed her state income tax returns for the 2013 – 2017 tax years (SOR 1.b); and
that she owed $24,287 for past-due federal income taxes (SOR 1.c). The Government
also  alleged  under  Guideline  F  that  Applicant  owes  36  delinquent  or  past-due  debts
totaling $87,969 (SOR 1.d – 1.mm). Two of the allegations (SOR 1.v and 1.dd) address
unpaid satellite television and cell phone accounts, respectively, and total $6,419. The
remaining  allegations  addressed  unpaid  medical  accounts  that  comprise  about  93
percent of Applicant’s non-tax debt.
In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  with  explanation  the  allegations  at
SOR 1.v, and 1.w – 1.bb. She denied with explanation the allegations at SOR 1.a, 1.b,
1.dd, 1.ll, and 1.mm. Applicant indicated she could neither admit nor deny the allegations
at SOR 1.c – 1.u, 1.cc, and 1.ee – 1.kk, and her responses thereto have been entered as
denials. (Answer; Tr. 8 - 9) In addition to the facts established by Applicant’s admissions,
I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 52 years old and has worked as a long-distance truck driver since May
2005.  She  and  her husband,  with  whom  she  drives  as  a  two-person  team, have  been
married since June 2000. Applicant previously was married from July 1986 until divorcing
in February 1994. She had two children, now adults, during her first marriage. (GX 1)
Applicant  has  driven  on  government  contracts  for  her  current  employer  since
December 2016. She previously worked for that company between May 2005 and April
2013. She then worked for a different trucking company, also on government contracts,
until October 2015, when she fell ill while on the road for work. From October 2015 until
November 2016,  Applicant  worked  at  home as  bookkeeper for  her  husband  while  she
recuperated and he drove on his own. Applicant was first granted a security clearance in
2006. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2)
Applicant and her husband own their own truck and “lease” its use and their driving
services  to  the  transportation  company  with  whom  the  government  contracts  the
transportation of sensitive materials and access to sensitive locations. Applicant’s income
is reported to the IRS as that of a contract employee. She receives IRS Form 1099s each
year and is required to report and pay her income taxes either on a quarterly or annual
basis. Much of her attention throughout each year is on accurately recording her work
hours, costs of operation, and other factors required to accurately assess and report her
tax obligations. To that end, since they started their long-distance trucking work in 2005,
she and her husband used an individual (T) to compile the necessary information in the
form of receipts and driving logs and information from the transportation company. T then
forwarded  the  information  to  an  accountant  /  tax  lawyer  (H)  whom  Applicant  and  her
husband started using around the same time to file their joint federal and state income
tax returns. (Answer; AX A; Tr. 25, 37 – 45)
In 2011, Applicant was severely injured in a motorcycle accident. As a result, she
was  unable  to  work  for  several  months.  The  timing  of  her  accident  coincided  with  the
deadline for tax return filing for the 2010 tax year and Applicant did not file her federal or
state returns on time. It also does not appear that she requested an extension of the filing
deadline. Her 2010 returns were filed in August 2014. Applicant also did not file her 2011
returns until October 2016. Her 2012 returns were not filed until November 2017. During
these tax years, aside from time off in 2011 recuperating from her motorcycle accident,
Applicant steadily drove for the company that currently employs her. (Answer; GX 1; GX
2)
When  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  as  part  of  her
background investigation in  May 2018, she stated that her 2013 and 2014 federal and
state income tax returns would be filed by  October 2018, and that her 2015 and 2016
returns  would  be  filed  sometime  in  2019.  At  her  hearing,  Applicant  provided  copies  of
prepared  federal  income  tax  returns  for 2013  and  2014,  but  she  did  not  establish  that
those returns had been filed. Additionally, Applicant had not yet filed her returns for the
2015 through 2018 tax years. Applicant claimed her failure to file was due, in part, to the
fact that T developed cancer in 2016 and died sometime between 2017 and 2018. She
also claimed H’s involvement in a car accident in January 2020 caused her delay in filing
her tax returns; however, in August 2018, H told Applicant she (H) could not complete her
work on Applicant’s past-due returns until Applicant produced the information required to
complete  the  returns.  Applicant  did  not  provide  that  information  until  early  2019.  On
February 4, 2020, H told Applicant that her returns for 2015  – 2018 would be ready by
the end of February 2020. (Answer; GX 2; AX A; Tr. 20, 24 – 25, 40 – 45, 48 – 49, 50 –
52, 63 – 66)
SOR 1.c alleges that Applicant owes $24,287 in unpaid federal taxes.  Applicant
denied this allegation. SOR 1.c is based on Applicant’s disclosure in Section 26 of her
most recent e-QIP regarding her 2013 taxes. Additionally, information she discussed with
a government investigator during her May 16, 2018 subject interview (SI) about unpaid
taxes supports this allegation. During her SI, Applicant did not dispute that she owed a
significant unpaid tax debt and averred she would establish a repayment agreement with
the IRS to satisfy any past-due tax obligations; however, at her hearing, Applicant simply
denied that the IRS was trying to collect the tax debt described at SOR 1.c. Information
she  provided  in  response  to  interrogatories  in  November  2018  showed  that  Applicant
owed $20,257 for 2011 and $5,030 for 2012. Available information shows that the debt
alleged at SOR 1.c is actually $25,287, an apparent arithmetical error. (Answer; GX 1;
GX 2; Tr. 12, 22, 45 – 46, 59 – 62)
In  October  2015,  while  on  the  road  for  a  different  transportation  company,
Applicant was taken to the emergency room. She had been found unconscious and in
severe  respiratory  distress.  At  the  time,  she  did  not  carry  any  medical  insurance.  The
medical debts alleged at SOR 1.d – 1.u, as well as the delinquent cell phone account at
SOR  1.v,  arose from that  medical  emergency  and from  her 2011 motorcycle  accident.
Applicant and her husband experienced a significant loss of income for the rest of 2015
and throughout 2016, because she could not drive and he was limited in how much work
he  could  take  on  as  a  solo  driver  on  non-government  contracts.  In  January  2017,
Applicant and her husband  resumed driving as a team and restored some of their lost
income. By operation of state law, most of the aforementioned debts may no longer be
collectable;  however,  there  is  no  indication  that  Applicant  addressed  any  of  them  or
sought assistance in resolving them after she returned to work full time despite having
received  collection  notices  at  or  near  the  time  her  earlier  debts  became  delinquent.
(Answer; GX 1 – 6; Tr. 12 – 13, 57 – 58)
In January 2018, Applicant was involved in another accident when the car she was
driving was struck by a tractor trailer. Applicant again was injured and lost significant time
and income from work. In about July 2018, she returned to work full time. Additionally,
she  also  received  a  large  civil  settlement  in  May  2019  after  filing  suit  in  March  2018
against  the  trucking  company  operating  the  truck  that  struck  her.  The  medical  debts
alleged at SOR 1.x – 1.cc, as well as the delinquent cell phone account at SOR 1.dd,
resulted from the January 2018 accident, and the proceeds from the civil settlement are
being used to resolve those accounts. Applicant also indicated the settlement is sufficient
to  resolve  her  outstanding  tax  obligations,  but  there  is  no  indication  that  any  such
payments have been made. (Answer; GX 2 – 6; AX B – D; Tr. 13, 23 – 24, 55 – 57, 61)
Applicant  and  her  husband  have  excellent  reputations  with  their  employer.  The
company’s vice president for safety has known them since they started driving in 2005.
He believes they are reliable and trustworthy, and testified that they have not caused any
safety or security problems in their tenure with that company. That witness was aware of
Applicant’s  medically  related  financial  problems  but  was  not  aware  of  any  problems
related  to  Applicant’s  income  taxes.  As  to  their  current  finances,  Applicant  and  her
husband live frugally and within their means. After their personal vehicle was totaled in
Applicant’s  2018  accident,  they  purchased  an  older  used  vehicle  rather than  incur  the
financing costs of a new car. They have owned their house for about 16 years, and there
is no indication that they have incurred any new debts that they are unable to pay. (Tr. 34
– 35, 74 – 87)
