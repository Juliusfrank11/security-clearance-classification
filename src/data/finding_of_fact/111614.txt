Applicant is a 39-year-old compliance specialist who has worked in that capacity
for nearly two years. He has earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration and
an associate’s degree in management. He is currently working toward a master’s degree.
(Tr. 34) Applicant is well-regarded amongst his professional and work peers, and recently
received a sizeable salary raise. He served in one branch of the United States military on
active duty, then in another branch as both a reservist and on active duty. This occurred
between 1998, shortly after his high school graduation, and 2003. In the interim, while
living independently and away from home for the first time, he lived beyond his means.
This led him to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection  in 2002, while still in his early
20s. In 2003, he received a general discharge from the military “not for the performance
of [his] work, [but] for not being able to sustain [his] financial obligations.” (Tr. 51-52)
Today, Applicant is married. The couple has two preteen children. Both children
experienced differing allergic conditions from birth to about age two, requiring special care
and products that adversely impacted Applicant financially during intermittent periods of
employment and of unemployment. (Tr. 31-32).
In 2006, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection, which included the
rollover of the 2002 bankruptcy petition which had been dismissed in June 2004. (Tr. 53)
He did so on the advice of counsel. This included debts related to the couples’ necessities,
medical  services,  and  other  obligations  accrued  during  periods  of  unemployment  or
underemployment by one or both of the spouses. Without thus resorting to bankruptcy,
he had been unable to maintain payment arrangements or otherwise meet his obligations
despite taking a secondary job. (Tr. 53) Ultimately, that bankruptcy action was dismissed
in October 2006 for failure to make timely payments.
In  about  October  2009,  Applicant  filed  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  regarding  his
personal debts. The bankruptcy was discharged in January 2010, giving him a clean slate.
He  was  unemployed  for  two  six-month  periods  in  2009  and  2011.  He  then  lost  health
insurance  coverage  in  2012,  leading  to a  period  of  inadequate  coverage from 2012  to
2017, during which his children suffered their allergy problems. (Tr. 71)
In September 2015, however, the couple filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which
included mostly medical bills and related debts. (Tr. 57) Some of those medical bills were
new, were for addressing the children’s allergy needs, or for his wife’s medical treatments
during periods of unemployment (2009 and 2011). He failed to make or was late making
payments  in  January  2016,  October  2016,  July  2017,  October  2017,  November  2017,
January  2018,  August  2018,  and  September  2018.  Some  of  these  payments  were
interrupted  because  the  family  incurred  additional  debt  for  child  care  and  education  in
preparation  for  a  relocation.  (Tr.  77)  To  date,  however,  they  have  paid  about  $30,000
toward the bankruptcy petition balance with a current balance remaining of under $11,000
to  be paid  by  October  2021.  (Tr.  58-59) The  payment  schedule  and  balances  due  are
manageable.
At  present,  Applicant  is  living  within  his means.  Each  month,  after  all  expenses
and obligations, he has a net remainder of about $3,200, and he has a $5,000 promotion
anticipated in the foreseeable future. (Tr. 36-37) He is current on his credit cards. The
family has not had any extravagant expenses or vacations in recent times. They actively
contribute to a savings account and a 401k account. (Tr. 42) Applicant has two late model
vehicles (2008 and 2011) included in his bankruptcy petition. His wife works as an office
manager. (Tr. 38) Applicant’s wife manages the household accounts. A balance owed to
an academic institution for  contested fees in the  amount of $6,479 has been satisfied.
(AE 57-59)
Applicant had a past-due amount of $1,099 due on a total balance of $16,360. This
was for a new vehicle bought in 2017 to replace an unreliable car his wife had been using
for transporting the children. That account is now current. (Tr. 65-66; Ex. 9)
