In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, 2.a,
and 2.b. (HE 3) He denied the other SOR allegations. He also provided extenuating and

Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that from about 2003 until at least October 2014, Applicant used
marijuana with varying frequency. SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that from about March 2005 until
June  2008,  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  while  holding  a  security
clearance. SOR ¶ 1.c alleges that from about  March 2012 until at least October 2014,
Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency while employed in a position of public
trust.  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.c  explaining  that  his  marijuana  use  was
limited to June and July 2014. (HE 2)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges that from about June 2014 to July 2014, Applicant purchased
marijuana with varying frequency. SOR ¶ 1.e alleges that in about May 2014, Applicant
was  arrested  and  charged  with  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia  and  possession  of
marijuana while operating a motor vehicle. (GE 8 at 1) In May 2014, Applicant had a drink
of alcohol before he started driving home. (Tr. 24) A police officer said he crossed the
center line. (Tr. 24) He also had an open container of alcohol in his vehicle. (Tr. 24) The
police officer searched Applicant and found marijuana in his possession. (Tr. 24; GE 1 at
33) He also had a small glass marijuana pipe in his vehicle. (Tr. 25) He was not charged
with an alcohol offense. When he went to court, he received deferred adjudication for one
year,  and  his  record  was  expunged  after  one  year.  (GE  1)  Applicant  said  he  used
marijuana  three  or four  times  in  May  2014.  (Tr.  23,  25-26)  He  insisted  he  did  not  use
marijuana before May 2014. (Tr. 26) He clarified that he used marijuana 10 to 15 times
or  once  or  twice  a  week  from  May  through  July  2014.  (Tr.  35)  He  held  a  public  trust
position when he possessed marijuana. (GE 1 at 33)
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  that  in  about  October  2014,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  by  a
licensed addiction  counselor (LAC)  with  a  condition  called  Cannabis  Abuse. The  court
adjudicating  Applicant’s  July  2014  arrest  required  him  to  undergo  a  substance-abuse
evaluation. (Tr. 30) On October 9, 2014, an LAC interviewed Applicant. (Tr. 30) According
to the LAC’s report (also dated October 9, 2014), Applicant told the evaluator:
[Applicant] reports first drinking at age 17 and smoked pot for the first time
at age 18. States he got intoxicated for the first time at age 17 and has been
a regular user since age 18. States he drank three times and smoked pot
once in the last 30 days. States pot is his drug of choice, a bowl once or
twice a day . . . . States the last time he drank was 10-04-14, last time he
smoked pot was about a week and a half ago . . . . States he spends $50.00
to $100.00 a month on using . . . . States . . . pot relaxes him. Denies being
preoccupied  with  the  thought  of using.  [Applicant]  states  his using isn’t  a
problem . . . . States he has four close friends and they all use . . . . States
his mother and father are chemically dependent, they live in [a state where
marijuana] is legal. (GE 5)
The  LAC  indicated  in  Axis  I:  305.20  (Cannabis  Abuse);  and  305.00  (Alcohol
Abuse). (GE 5) The LAC concluded Applicant was “not chemically dependent,” and he
should receive a 16-hour education program. (GE 5)
Applicant  strenuously  disputes  the  LAC’s  description  of  his  marijuana  use;
however, he did not give a reason the evaluator would intentionally lie about the duration
and frequency of Applicant’s marijuana use. (Tr. 33) Applicant suggested the evaluator
“got [his] notes mixed up.” (Tr. 33) He said the LAC may have confused his description of
his alcohol use with his description of his marijuana use. (Tr. 37) Applicant called the LAC
and confronted him with his concerns about the accuracy of his notes. (Tr. 33) Applicant
said  the  LAC  mentioned  his  inability  to  remember  what  Applicant  said  during  the
interview;  however,  the  LAC  refused  to  disavow  the  accuracy  of  his  notes.  (Tr.  33)
Applicant provided a letter from the LAC dated March 28, 2019, which states as follows:
[Applicant]  called  me  on  03-19-19,  concerning  the  alcohol  and  drug
evaluation I did on him on 10-09-14. He was questioning the information in
the evaluation of when he first used marijuana. At the time of the evaluation
he reported first using at age 18. He went on stating in the report that he
used pot in the thirty days prior to 10-09-14, but during the call he assured
me that he didn’t use before 2014. When talking to [Applicant] on 03-19-19,
he  said  he  didn’t  know  if  he  reported  that  information  inaccurately  or  if  I
made a mistake in my documentation. I have no way of knowing if this is
accurate other than looking at the information I received at the time of the
evaluation. If he feels this is inaccurate, I have no other recommendation
for him other than to get another evaluation. (AE C)
Applicant said that he could not have used marijuana when he was on active duty
in the Air Force and held a TS/SCI-level clearance because of the frequency of the Air
Force’s urinalysis testing of those holding TS/SCI-level clearances with access to nuclear
materials. (Tr. 40) He insisted the LAC’s notes were not accurate. (Tr. 40-41)
There is no evidence Applicant tested positive on a urinalysis test for use of illegal
drugs. Applicant denied that he currently possesses any marijuana or drug paraphernalia.
(Tr. 38) He has friends  that  use marijuana; however, they  do  not use marijuana  in  his
presence. (Tr. 39)
Alcohol Consumption
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges that Applicant was arrested in  about July 2014, and charged
with  operating  a  vehicle  while  intoxicated.  Applicant  was  sad  or  depressed  about  his
situation after his marijuana-related arrest in May 2014, and he made a bad decision to
drink excessive amounts of alcohol. (Tr. 26-27) In July 2014, he drank eight or nine beers
over a six-hour period. (Tr. 39) The police stopped Applicant’s vehicle for improper lane
change and asked him if he drank any alcohol that day. (Tr. 26, 39; GE 3; GE 6) Applicant
denied that he drank any alcohol to the police officer because he did not want to go to
jail. (Tr. 39; GE 6) Applicant subsequently told the police officer that he only had two or
three drinks. (Tr. 39; GE 6) The preliminary blood alcohol test indicated .129 BAC. (GE 6
at 2) A police officer found an open container of beer in Applicant’s vehicle. (GE 6 at 1)
Upon arrival at jail, the police found marijuana on Applicant’s person. (GE 6 at 1-2) Two
breath tests were administered at the jail with results of .10 and .11 BACs. (GE 6 at 2)
Applicant was not charged with possession of the marijuana found on his person
in July 2014. (GE 3) Applicant pleaded guilty to operating while impaired (OWI), and he
was  sentenced  to  six  months  of  probation,  to  pay  a  fine,  to  have  a  substance-abuse
assessment, and to complete a 16-hour alcohol-treatment class. (GE 1 at 34; GE 6; GE
7) Applicant did not inform his supervisor or security officer of his arrests in May and July
2014. (Tr. 28) He said he did not inform the government of his arrests because of “fear of
losing  my  job.”  (GE  4  at  18)  About  a  year  after  his  second  arrest,  the  government
conducted a  background  check of  contractor  employees  because of  a  security  breach
unrelated to Applicant’s conduct, and his employer discovered his two arrests in 2014.
(Tr. 29) Applicant’s contractor employer fired him. (Tr. 29)
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges that Applicant was diagnosed by an LAC with a condition called
Alcohol Abuse. Applicant consumed alcohol since the age of 17. (Tr. 36) In 2014, he was
drinking alcohol four or five times a week. (Tr. 36)
In Applicant’s September 17, 2018 response to DOHA interrogatories, he said he
consumed two to three drinks, two to three times a month. (GE 4 at 19) The most recent
time he was intoxicated was on September 15, 2018. (GE 4 at 20) Applicant stated at his
hearing that he has dramatically reduced his alcohol consumption to about once every
two months. (Tr. 37) There is no evidence of alcohol-related incidents involving the police
or the courts after July 2014.
Personal Conduct
The  SOR  cross-alleges  in  ¶  3.a  the  same  conduct  as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a
through 1.e above. The SOR alleges that Applicant falsified material facts as follows:
SOR ¶ 3.b alleges Applicant stated that on or about July 5, 2016, he completed an
SCA which asked in Section 23 about whether he used any controlled substance in the
previous seven years. Applicant responded, yes, and said “I had never smoked marijuana
before June 2014. I was introduced to it during a rough period in my life. I only smoked it
a handful of times, and stopped all together in July of 2014.” (GE 1 at 32) He said he
“[e]xperimented  with  it,  only  smoked  10-15  times  between the  beginning  of  June  2014
and the end of July 2014.” (Id.) After his arrests for possession of marijuana and OWI, he
said he “decided it was time to get my life back on track. I was forced to resign my position
due to the charge. My experimental use of marijuana did damage to my life as a whole,
and I will never use it again.” (Id.)
SOR ¶ 3.c alleges Applicant stated that on or about October 19, 2017, during an
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  personal  subject  interview  (PSI),  he  used
marijuana 10 to 15 times between June and July 2014. (GE 3 at 4) He specifically denied
any marijuana use prior to June 2014. (GE 3 at 4) He said he purchased marijuana once,
and the other times he received marijuana without purchasing it. (GE 3 at 4-5)
SOR  ¶  3.d  alleges  Applicant  responded  to  DOHA  interrogatories  on  or  about
September 17, 2018, and he denied that he used marijuana except for 10 to 15 times
between June and July 2014. (GE 4) He said in his DOHA interrogatories that from April
2014 to July 2014, he used marijuana two to four times a week. (GE 4 at 9) He also said
he “bought small amounts of marijuana for personal use from April 2014  – July 2014.”
(GE 4 at 9) He concluded, “I only started smoking marijuana well after I was divorced. I
smoked a handful of times over a few month period in 2014. I stopped because marijuana
was not the way to deal with my problems.” (GE 4 at 11)
Applicant failed to disclose or admit the full duration and frequency of his marijuana
use  as  indicated  in  the  October  9,  2014  substance-abuse  evaluation  in  the  drug
involvement and substance misuse section of this decision, supra. Applicant told the LAC
on October 9, 2014, he used marijuana “once in the last 30 days” or about 10 days before
his interview. (GE 5)
Character Evidence
Six coworkers, colleagues, and/or friends as well as his former spouse provided
character  statements  supporting  reinstatement  of  Applicant’s  access  to  classified
information. (AE B; AE D-I) His character evidence includes statements from persons who
are  honorably  retired  after  many  years  of  military  service,  senior  noncommissioned
officers on active duty, and highly trained technicians and managers. The general sense
of  their  statements  is  that  Applicant  is  diligent,  knowledgeable,  intelligent,  meticulous,
professional, generous, loyal, honest, a good leader, and trustworthy. (AE B; AE D-I) His
hard  work  and  professionalism  made  substantial  contributions
to  mission
accomplishment. (AE B; AE D-I) None of his character statements described any abuse
of  alcohol  or use  of  illegal  drugs  by  Applicant.  (AE  B-AE  D-I)  There  is  no  evidence  of
security  violations,  improper  disclosure  of  classified  information,  or  that  Applicant
compromised national security.
