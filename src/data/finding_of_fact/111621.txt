Applicant admitted  both SOR allegations,  ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, with explanations and
documentation.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  62  years  old.  He  has  never  married  and  he  has  no  children.  He
earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1981.  He  has  worked  for  the  same  employer,  a  large
defense  contractor,  ever  since.  He  installs  systems  on  submarines.  He  has  had  a
clearance since 1982. He has never had any security violations or incidents. (GE 1; AE
A-E; Tr. 25-28, 42, 44, 68) Recent work evaluations show he has met or exceeded all
professional expectations. (AE E)
Applicant lived and worked  in State 1 from 1994 to October 2004. (GE 1 at 12;
Tr. 68) From October 2004 to June 2010, he lived and worked in State 2, which has no
state  income  tax.  (GE  2  at  8-9;  Tr.  42,  46-47,  68-69)  From  July  2010  to  September
2017, he lived and worked in State 3, which has a state income tax. (GE 4; Tr. 43, 69)
Since September 2017, he has lived and worked in State 4 (Tr. 43, 69).
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns as
required  for  tax  year  2004  and  for  tax  years  2006-2010.  SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  that
Applicant failed to timely file State 3 income tax returns as required for tax years 2011-
2016.  This  is  based  on  the  information  he  provided  in  security  clearance  applications
and interrogatory responses. (Ans. Att. 2, Ans. Att. 3; GE 3, GE 4)
Applicant  testified  that  before 2004,  he  always  filed  his tax  returns  on  time.  (Tr.
43) When he  submitted  an SCA  in  April 2010 for his previous  clearance  investigation,
he disclosed that he had “unfiled federal tax returns from 2004 to present” as well as an
unfiled 2004 State 1 income tax return (not alleged). (GE 1 at 12, 33, 34, 42; Tr. 45, 72-
73)
Applicant  discussed  his  unfiled  income  tax  returns  during  his  2010  background
interview.  He  said  that  his  tax  filing  issues  were  because  of  “the  hassle  of  the
paperwork” and because he moved frequently for  his job. (GE 5 at 3; Tr. 53) His 2010
clearance application was subsequently granted. (GE 2 at 23)
On  his  2015  SCA,  Applicant  reported  additional  tax  issues.  As  before,  he
reported  “unfiled  federal  returns  for  2004  to  2010.”  He  also  referenced  unfiled  State  3
tax returns from 2010-2014. He explained that his tax filing issues “started when banks
ceased sending out Form 1099-INT for small amounts of interest.” (GE 2 at 24) He also
stated,
Frequent  moves,  long  distance,  and  the  small  amounts  involved  left  me
disinclined  to  chase  it all  down  and  unwilling  to  swear to the  accuracy  of
my  estimates  for  tax  years  2010  and  2011.  Not  filing  2012,  2013,  and
2014 is a combination of laziness and not receiving any letters of protest.
(GE 2 at 24)
Applicant expanded on this explanation in his Answer and his hearing testimony.
He testified that he did not want to underreport his interest income from his various bank
accounts,  when  those  banks  did  not  him  provide  1099-INT  forms  with  exact  details.
(Answer; Tr. 59-61, 64, 84-85) He said to do so would be “lying on a government form.”
(Tr. 62) He did not contact his banks to learn why he did not get a Form 1099-INT, nor
did he contact the IRS to discuss his options beyond not filing his tax return because he
lacked such forms. (Tr. 63) He was not aware that banks do not issue 1099-INT forms
when the annual interest a taxpayer receives from an account  is so small as to be not
reportable. (Tr. 59-60; Answer)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  the  IRS  does not have  a  duty  to  inform him  of  his
own  duty  to file an annual  return.  From before  his tax  issues began,  he  was  aware  of
the significance of the April 15 annual federal tax deadline, and said it is  “crystal clear
these days.” (Tr. 81, 88-89)
Applicant’s  IRS  account  transcripts  show  that,  as  of  2018,  no federal tax  return
had been filed for tax years 2004, 2006, 2007, or 2010. The IRS prepared substitute tax
returns for tax years 2008 and 2009. (GE 3; GE 4; Tr. 56) (SOR ¶ 1.a)
Applicant  testified  that  he  did  not  know  whether  he  had  ever  filed  his  federal
income tax returns for tax years 2004, 2006, 2007, or 2008. (Tr. 54-55) He testified that
he  had  filed  his  2009  and  2010  federal  income  tax  returns,  but  provided  no  updated
corroborating  documentation.  He  believes  he  filed  his  past  due  returns  in  2017,  after
prompting by his background investigator. (Tr. (Tr. 36-38), 74-75)
Applicant  filed  his federal  income  tax  returns  on  time  for  tax  years  2005,  2011,
2013, and 2014, and he filed his 2012 federal return in late April 2013 (a few days late).
(GE  4)  He  also  documented  that  his  subsequent  federal  returns  (2014-2018)  have  all
been filed on time. (AE I, M; Tr. 44)
As  to  SOR ¶  1.b,  the documentation  Applicant  provided  in a  2018 interrogatory
response,  from  the  State  3  tax  authority,  shows  that  his  2011-2016  returns  had  been
filed,  but  were  filed  late.  (GE  4  at  12;  Tr.  57)  Applicant  testified  that  he  filed  those
returns in 2017, when he moved to State 4. He acknowledged that he filed the returns
due to “pressure from the investigator” (Tr. 58, 63, 74-75, 77)
Applicant  explained  that  his  late  filing  of  his  State  3  tax  returns  was  due  to
“habit,” because he moved there from State 2, a state with no state income tax return).
(Tr.  52,  76,  85)  As  of  March  2018,  Applicant  was  in  compliance  with  State  3  tax
authorities and owed no taxes or other liability there. (GE 4 at 14; Tr. 39)
Applicant provided a variety of reasons why he did not file his tax returns. In his
background interviews, he said it was because he was “lazy.” (GE 6 at 4; Tr. 40, 65) He
also said he rarely owed money in taxes. (Tr. 30-31; AE G, AE H, AE I)
In  his  Answer and  at hearing,  Applicant  also  asserted, for  the first  time, that  he
has  a  medical  condition  that  has  caused  him  severe  concentration  problems.  Those
issues,  in  turn,  made  it  difficult  for  him  to  prepare  and  file  his  tax  returns  on  time.
(Answer; Tr. 41-42, 85) He was diagnosed with the condition in 2011. (Ans. Att. 1; Tr.
65-66),  a  year  that  post-dates  all  of  the  tax  years  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.  Applicant
asserted that his condition went undiagnosed for some time.
Applicant  also  provided  no  documentation  to  corroborate  the  assertion  that  the
medical condition causes concentration problems. (Tr. 65, 69) He acknowledged during
his  testimony  that  none  of  his  own  doctors  had  ever  told  him  that.  (Tr.  70)  He  also
acknowledged that he had never had concentration problems  in other areas of his life.
(Tr.  70)  He  said  his  medical  condition  is  under  control,  and  his  concentration  has
improved. (Tr. 42, 69)
Applicant  testified  at  hearing  that  he  is  current  on  his  tax  filings,  including  with
State 4, where he now lives. (Tr. 28, 83) He earns over $130,000 annually. (Tr. 28) He
has excellent credit (AE F) and between $80,000 and $90,000 in savings. (Tr. 33; AE H,
AE J, AE K, AE L) He has no difficulty paying his bills. (Tr. 44)
Post-hearing, Applicant provided receipts from a nationally known tax preparation
service showing a $600 payment and receipts for certified mailings to the IRS, all dated
January  2020.  (AE  N) What  was  prepared  by  the  tax  service  and  what  was  mailed  to
the IRS is not clear, since it is not in the record.
