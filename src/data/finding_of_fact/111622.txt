Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges the following financial allegations:
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  filed  for  bankruptcy  under  Chapter  13  of  the
Bankruptcy  Code  in  2000.  His  unsecured  nonpriority  debts  were  discharged  under
Chapter 13 in 2005. Most of the reason for his bankruptcy related to unemployment and
underemployment  in  2000  or  2001  for  himself  or  his  spouse  or  both.  (Tr.  17)  About
$12,000 to $15,000 of his financial problems related to Applicant’s gambling. (HE 3; GE
2 at 11) Applicant said his bankruptcy debts were mostly from “credit card[s] and a little
gambling charges.” (Tr. 36; HE 3) He learned during financial counseling that gambling
was not a good idea, and he regretted not following that advice. (Tr. 42)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  Applicant  filed  for  bankruptcy  under  Chapter  13  of  the
Bankruptcy Code in September 2015. About $45,000 of his bankruptcy debt resulted from
gambling. (GE 2 at 11) Applicant listed $92,000 for credit cards and cash advances, and
some  of  that  debt  was  due  to  gambling.  (Tr.  38)  He  filed  bankruptcy  because  he  lost
money on a real estate property, and Applicant or his wife or both lost their employment
and  had  to  settle  for  lower  paying  employment.  (Tr.  39-40)  His  secured  claims  were
$147,854; his priority claims were $20,588; and his nonpriority unsecured claims totaled
$124,652.  (GE  5  at  38)  In  his  SOR  response,  Applicant  said  he  and  his  spouse  paid
$123,975 to the trustee, and he had 15 payments of $2,755 totaling $41,325 remaining
in his payment plan. (HE 3) He said he never missed a payment to the trustee. He worked
multiple jobs in order to fund payments to the bankruptcy trustee. (Tr. 23)  He received
financial counseling, which included an online class on gambling. (Tr. 41-42; GE 2 at 11)
He  completed  the  bankruptcy  one  year  early  by  paying  all  of  the  creditors.  (Tr.  23)  In
August 2019, Applicant’s unsecured nonpriority debts were discharged under Chapter 13.
(AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant is indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for
$2,877  for  tax  years  2014  to  2017.  Applicant’s  tax  transcript  for  tax  year  2013  shows
adjusted gross income of about $163,000 and taxable income of about $73,000. (Tr. 53;
GE 2 at 19) Applicant does not prepare his own federal income tax returns, and he did
not know the basis for the deduction or deductions that reduced his taxable income by
about $90,000 in tax year 2013. (Tr. 53-54) In his 2015 bankruptcy filing, he indicated he
owed $12,339 to the IRS for tax years 2013 and 2015. (GE 5 at 22) In June 2018, the
IRS wrote that Applicant owed $1,566 for tax year 2017. (HE 3) On April 24, 2019, the
IRS said Applicant owed $2,660 for tax years 2015 and 2017. (HE 3) His federal taxes
for  tax  years  2013  and  2014  were  paid  through  his  Chapter  13  bankruptcy.  (HE  3)
Applicant’s January 22, 2020 IRS tax transcript shows that he paid the IRS $2,755 on
May 6, 2019, and $1,000 on October 30, 2019, resolving all delinquent tax debts except
for tax year 2018. (HE 3; AE A) The tax debts for years before 2018 are resolved because
the IRS applies tax payments to the oldest tax debt first, and the $1,000 payment was
applied to tax year 2018. Applicant’s April 8, 2019 and January 22, 2020 IRS income tax
transcripts  provided  the  information  reflected  in  the  following  table.  Amounts  above
$1,000 are rounded to nearest thousand dollars.

SOR ¶ 1.d alleges Applicant is indebted to a state tax authority for $1,676. In his
2015 bankruptcy filing, he indicated he owed $6,284 to the state tax authority for tax years
2013 and 2015. (GE 5 at 22) On January 29, 2019, the state tax authority wrote that tax
returns for tax years 2013 to 2017 were timely filed. (GE 2 at 31) Each tax year from 2013
to 2017, he owed from $1,934 to $3,280 when his tax returns were filed. (GE 2 at 31) As
of January 29, 2019, all state taxes were paid except for $1,656 owed for tax year 2017.
(HE 3; GE 2 at 31-32) On January 22, 2020, the state tax authority wrote that his state
taxes were all paid. (AE A)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  Applicant  continues  to  gamble.  Applicant  said  he  had  been
gambling for 35 years. (Tr. 19) Applicant’s July 12, 2017 Office of Personnel Management
personal subject interview summary of interview states:
In [the] 1990’s or early 2000’s he may have gone [to casinos] two times per
week, but for the most part he has gone once per week on the weekends
with  his wife.  He  continues  to  go  once per week  because  this is his only
source of entertainment.
Over the last fifteen to eighteen years, Subject and his wife have spent from
$200-300  to  $800-900  per  week.  They  would  take  cash  advances  from
credit cards, which [were] tough to pay back. As a result, they had about
$45,000 in credit card debt for this most recent bankruptcy. . . . For his first
bankruptcy, he may have had about $12,000 to $15,000 in gambling debt
included in that. (GE 2 at 11)
Applicant said no one in security or his company told him he was not allowed to
gamble or that it was illegal for him to gamble. (Tr. 16, 20) He used gambling to relieve
stress.  (GE  2  at  11)  Applicant  said  he  was  in  the  “process  of  curtailing  the  gambling
scene.” (HE 3) He currently gambles about once every week or two. (Tr. 34) He usually
stays  at  the  casino  for  two  or  three  hours.  (Tr.  35)  He  typically  spends  $300  to  $400
gambling per session. (Tr. 35) He decided to continue gambling because he did not enjoy
other hobbies as much as gambling. (Tr. 42-43) The night before his hearing, he gambled
and lost $3,000. (Tr. 43) He had the cash to pay for his gambling loss, and he did not
need to charge his loss on his credit cards. (Tr. 45-46) He is willing to stop gambling if
this decision indicates he should stop gambling. (Tr. 52) Otherwise, he intends to continue
gambling as long as he is employed. (Tr. 51-52)
Applicant indicated he and his spouse’s gross monthly pay totals $13,300. (HE 3)
Their  net  monthly  pay  is  about  $9,500.  (Tr.  46-49)  He  currently  has  a  net  monthly
remainder of about $5,000. (Tr. 49) He has $1,400 in his checking account and $22 in his
savings account. (Tr. 50) He estimated that he owed the federal government $6,000 for
tax year 2018. (Tr. 50-51) He said he might owe the federal government additional taxes
when he files his tax return for tax year 2019. (Tr. 51) When he gambled after his second
bankruptcy  filing,  he  did  not  take  cash  advances  from  credit  cards,  and  he  limited  his
gambling to the amount of funds in his bank accounts. (GE 2 at 11)
Applicant concluded his statement at his hearing commenting:
I’m sorry. I’m sorry I gambled. I’m sorry I did both bankruptcies. I was not
very smart. At the time, it was fun. At the time now, it ain’t fun. At the time
coming up, it ain’t going to be fun, the way it looks. So I’ve worked all my
life and I’ve tried to do the best I can both ethically and honorably. But again,
I failed. So sorry. (Tr. 57)
And again, I’m not the smartest man in the world. But I’m just a hard worker.
And I try to do my best. And I try to help people. But the gambling was part
of it. The credit cards [were] the other part of it. The whole situation is, it’s
dire now. And like I said, I’m 74. I’m having physical and health problems.
(Tr. 60)
After his hearing, Applicant said he was quitting gambling “cold turkey.” (AE A) He
sent gambling coupons and discounts from casinos that he would be able to use if he
gambled. (AE A) He also provided two IRS Forms W-2G, Certain Gambling Winnings,
showing he received income on January 7, 2020, of $4,266, and on January 14, 2020, of
$$1,250. (AE A)
Applicant described a variety of physical and medical problems that make it difficult
for him to continue to work. (Tr. 21, 23-24, 65) Nevertheless, he indicated he wanted to
continue  to  work  for  his  current  employer,  a  DOD  contractor.  He  did  not  indicate  his
financial problems were due to paying for medical treatments.
