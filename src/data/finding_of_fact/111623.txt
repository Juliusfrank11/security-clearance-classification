Applicant admitted failing to timely file his 2008-2012 and 2014 Federal income tax
returns, accumulating over $51,000 delinquent Federal tax debt for tax years 2010-2011,
and  accumulating  over  $92,000  delinquent  state  tax  debt  (SOR  1.a-1.e).  At  hearing,
Department Counsel withdrew SOR allegations 1.d-1.e (Tr. 11).
Applicant is a 60-year-old self-employed consultant seeking access to classified
information.  He  has twice  married  and  divorced,  and  has  an adult  son.  He has  held  a
variety of clearances/public trust positions between April 1998 and February 2017 (GE
1).
Applicant  disclosed  failing  to  file  his  Federal  income  tax  returns,  and  resulting
indebtedness, on his December 2017 clearance application (GE 1). He discussed these
issues  during  his  March  2018  interview  with  a  Government  investigator  (GE  2).  He
attributed his failure to timely file his Federal income tax returns for the years at issue to
his April 2009 injury while on foreign travel. He claimed to be compliant with his payment
arrangements; however, it does not appear that he had any agreement with the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) at the time of the interview.
Applicant=s tax problems began in May 2009, when he was injured while traveling
overseas. He underwent significant surgery and rehabilitation. His final clinical review was
in July 2009 (AE B). Applicant claimed that his injury and recovery left him unable to work,
and he remained unemployed until November 2011, when he became a self-employed
consultant. Between November 2011 and October 2017, he held a series of consulting
and other positions, only one of which (October 2014-2015) lasted as long as a year.
Because  Applicant  was  unemployed,  he  took  premature  withdrawals  from  his
retirement  account  in  2009  to  pay  his  living  expenses,  not  fully  aware  of  the  tax
consequences of this action. He filed for an extension of time to file his tax year 2006-
2007 returns, but had only used a portion of each extension before filing his returns. He
received a $21,000 tax refund for tax year 2007. He had filed for an extension of time to
file his 2008 Federal income tax return, which gave him October 2009 to file. However,
he not only missed this deadline, he missed the three-year deadline for filing for the nearly
$21,000 tax refund to which he was otherwise entitled. He also missed the filing deadlines
for tax years 2009-2012.
Applicant=s  2009  premature  retirement  withdrawals  resulted
in  significant
unanticipated tax liability. It is not clear when Applicant first became aware of that liability,
but  the  IRS  filed  a  substitute  tax  return  in  late  December  2011.  Applicant=s  2009  tax
transcript shows that he later filed his tax return in July 2012, made some token payments
in late 2013-early 2014, had his taxes considered uncollectible in April 2014, made two
additional small  payments  with  a mid-October 2014  offer in  compromise,  and  had  that
offer denied in October 2015. Most of his 2009 tax liability was paid by seizing his 2013-
2016 tax refunds; the final balance appears to have been paid in March 2017.
In late December 2013, Applicant retained the services of a tax resolution service
(AE  3).  By  that  time,  Applicant  had  filed  his  then-delinquent  tax  returns.  The  service
appears to have successfully filed his 2013 and 2015-2016 income tax returns in a timely
fashion, but he was late filing his 2014 tax return, a default he has not really explained.
The tax service was unable to reach a successful offer in compromise with the IRS.
In late December 2017, Applicant retained the services of a tax attorney (GE 2).
He was also not able to settle Applicant=s taxes with an offer in compromise. However, in
May 2019, Applicant increased his 2019 Federal income tax withholding to increase his
potential 2019 refund, with an eye to having it seized and applied to his remaining 2010
balance  (AE  C).  In October  2019,  Applicant made a  lump-sum  payment  to  resolve  his
remaining  2011  tax  liability  (SOR  1.c).  In  November  2019,  Applicant  entered  into  a
repayment  agreement  with  the  IRS  to  begin  repaying  $450  monthly  beginning  in
December 2019, changing to $1,315 monthly beginning in December 2020. According to
the tax attorney, Applicant=s plan is to obtain a home equity line of credit on his home and
make the $50,000 lump sum payment necessary to pay the 2010 balance in full (AE C).
There is no indication to date that he has fallen through with this plan.
Applicant  documented  no  credit  or  financial  counseling,  and  did  not  submit  a
budget.  He  provided  no  work  or  character  references,  or  evidence  of  community
involvement.
