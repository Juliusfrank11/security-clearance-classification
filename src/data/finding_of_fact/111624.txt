Applicant admitted the ten allegations in the SOR. His admissions are incorporated
into these findings.
Applicant is 64 years old and a high school graduate. He has been married and
divorced three times. He has three children from his first marriage, whom he raised after
his wife left the family. After high school, he worked for a private company for 29 years,
until it closed. In 2007, he obtained a position with a defense contractor. He has continued
to work as a sub-contractor for defense contractors since then and has held a security
clearance since 2008. (Tr. 12, 32-36, 38)
In his 2016 SF 86, Applicant disclosed that he failed to file and pay Federal and
state tax returns for 2014 and 2015. (GE 1) According to IRS documents, his tax problems
began  with  unpaid  Federal  taxes  for  2010  and  2011.  (GE  6)  He  also  answered
interrogatories in 2018, in which he discussed his unfiled and unpaid Federal and state
income taxes. (GE 2)
Applicant  attributed  his  large  tax  delinquencies  and  financial  problems  to  four
factors: he mismanaged his income for many years; he financially supported his brother
and three children for three years when his brother’s wife left him; he supported his sister
after her divorces; and as a sub-contractor, he failed to pay Federal and state quarterly
taxes from 2010 to 2017. (Tr. 39-41, 61, 71)

While testifying, Applicant admitted that he did not timely file his tax returns and

attentive.” (Tr. 50) He did not know that failing to file or pay Federal and state taxes could
jeopardize his security clearance. (Tr. 68) He acknowledged that he procrastinated over
the years and did not diligently address his taxes and financial obligations. (Tr. 67) He

debts. He said the lawyer was not diligent in working on his case. (Tr. 70) He said his
supervisor is aware of this hearing and his tax problems. (Tr. 68-69) Two months ago,
Applicant hired a debt management company to help resolve $48,000 of credit card debt,

but may considered in making a credibility determination, in the application of mitigating
conditions, and in my whole-person analysis.) (Tr. 36-37)
Applicant’s  annual  income  is  $210,000.  For  the  last  ten  years,  his  salary  has
generally been about $200,000, varying by $10,000 to $20,000. (Tr. 45-46, 71) He now
