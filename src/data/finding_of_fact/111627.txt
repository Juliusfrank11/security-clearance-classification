Under  Guideline  D,  the  Government  alleged  that  in  November  2001,  Applicant
committed an indecent sexual act with his three-year-old daughter; and that in February
2005, he pleaded guilty a charge of indecency with a child, a second-degree felony (SOR
1.a)  Under Guideline J  (SOR  2.a) and  Guideline  E  (SOR 3.a),  the  Government  cross-
alleged  the  information  in  SOR  1.a  as  disqualifying  criminal  conduct  and  personal
conduct, respectively.
Under Guideline E, the Government also alleged that in January 2017, Applicant
intentionally made a false official statement to the Government during a personal subject
interview with an investigator about Applicant’s intent during the November 2001 incident
addressed in SOR 1.a (SOR 3.b).
Under  Guideline  F,  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  the
federal government for unpaid taxes for the 2004 (SOR 4.a), 2006 (SOR 4.b), 2007 (SOR
4.c),  and  2011  (SOR  4.d)  tax  years  totaling  $114,985.  At  the  hearing,  Department
Counsel moved to withdraw SOR 4.d and it was stricken. As a result, the total amount of
tax debt at issue in this case was reduced to $58,141. (Tr. 10)
In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanations SOR 1.a, 2.a, and
3.a. He denied with explanation any intent to falsify or mislead as alleged in SOR 3.b. As
to Guideline F, Applicant admitted with explanations SOR 4.b and 4.c, and denied SOR
4.a. In addition to the facts established by Applicant’s admissions, I make the following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 49 years old and employed as a project and logistics manager by a
defense  contractor for whom  he  has  worked  since  January  2016.  Applicant  served  on
active duty in the United States Army between 1991 and 1995. He was trained as a medic
in the Army and continued to work as an emergency medical technician and paramedic
after  leaving  the  military.  From  September  2003  until  October  2004,  Applicant  worked
overseas as a paramedic for a defense contractor. (GX 1; Tr. 51 – 54)
Applicant has been married twice. He and his first wife were married between 1992
and 1997. Applicant remarried in 1998 and had two children, a son, now age 16, and a
daughter, now age 21. Applicant and his second wife separated in 2005 and divorced in
2007;  however,  in  March  2010,  they  moved  in  together  for  financial  and  parenting
reasons. By the terms of their divorce, Applicant has principal custody of their 16-year-
old son. This arrangement appears to have been beneficial for all concerned. (GX 1; GX
5; Tr. 41)
In Section 26 of his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that his income tax refunds for the
preceding six years were applied to an $8,000 debt for unpaid taxes from 2009. During
the  ensuing  background  investigation,  investigators  identified  an  unsatisfied  tax  lien
against Applicant for the 2011 tax year. During a January 2017 subject interview with a
government  investigator,  Applicant  stated  he  had  no  knowledge  of  that  2011  tax  lien;
however, he confirmed his non-payment of his 2009 federal income taxes, explaining that
his  employer  did  not  withhold  his  taxes  as  he  had  expected  while  Applicant  worked
overseas. In November 2018, in response to interrogatories from DOD adjudicators and
in response to the SOR, Applicant provided information that showed he owes $16,062.98
in unpaid taxes for 2006, and $9,778.02 for unpaid taxes in 2007, as alleged in SOR 4.b
and 4.c, respectively. (Answer; GX 1; GX 4; GX 5; Tr. 47 – 51, 56 – 58)
Applicant also has denied that he owes $32,301 in unpaid taxes for the 2004 tax
year as alleged at SOR 4.a. However, in his November 2018 response to interrogatories,
he provided a May 2018 letter from the IRS showing he owed that amount for the 2004
tax year after his $283 tax refund for 2017 was applied. At his hearing, Applicant averred
he visited an IRS office in his state and was told that he did not owe any past-due taxes
for 2004. Applicant did not provide any support for that claim and his explanations for not
being able to corroborate his claims in this regard were not plausible. As to all of his past-
due  taxes,  apart from diversion  of  his income  tax  refunds by  the  IRS  to  satisfy  his  tax
debts, Applicant has not taken any identifiable action to arrange for repayment or other
resolution of this matter. (Answer; GX 4; Tr. 31, 42 – 47)
The matters alleged in SOR 1.a, 2.a, 3.a and 3.b arise from a single event. On or
about November 1, 2001, Applicant was home with his then-three-year-old daughter. The
child came into the bathroom and saw Applicant as he was coming out of the shower.
Rather than cover himself, Applicant had his daughter touch and rub his penis for sexual
gratification. In October 2003, Applicant’s wife was expecting their younger child, whom
they  knew  was  a  boy.  At  some  point,  his  wife  found  herself  explaining  this  physical
differences  between  boys  and  girls.  Applicant’s  daughter, who  was  then  six  years old,
told her mother she already knew  what a penis was because she had seen her father
without  clothes  on.  The  child  went  on  to  describe  for  her  mother  what  had  transpired
between  Applicant  and  his daughter in  2001.  Applicant’s  wife  called  the  police  and an
investigation began that culminated in May 2004 with a grand jury indictment of Applicant
on a charge of indecency with a child, a felony. Applicant was arrested in October 2004
when he returned from his job overseas. In February 2005, Applicant pleaded guilty to
that charge and given a suspended adjudication of guilt for five years, during which he
was  under  supervised  probation,  required  to  undergo  counseling,  and  ordered  to
complete 250 hours of community service. Between February 2005 and February 2010,
Applicant  was  prohibited  from  having  any  contact  with  his  children  or  with  any  person
under  age  17.  After  he  successfully  completed  probation,  the  felony  charge  was
dismissed; however, Applicant then had to register as a sex offender in State A where he
lived and where the offense occurred. In 2010, he moved to State B, where he still lives
and works, and registered as a sex offender there as well. His status as a registered sex
offender is to remain for 30 years, or until March 2040. Applicant acknowledged that he
is embarrassed  by  his conduct  but avers that  he  does not  try  to  hide  what  he  did.  He
testified that some of his neighbors know he is a registered sex offender either because
he  told  them  or  they  learned  of  it  through  online  public  information.  Applicant  is  now
eligible to petition State B for removal from the registry for sex offenders because he has
lived and worked in State B without incident or violation for at least 10 years. As of the
hearing, he had not yet filed a petition for removal. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 3; GX 5; Tr.
14, 30 – 31, 39 – 41)
During  his  January  2017  subject  interview  with  a  government  investigator,
Applicant discussed his conduct with his daughter. SOR 3.b alleges that he deliberately
withheld information from the investigator in an attempt to mislead the government about
his  conduct.  Specifically,  it  was  alleged  that  Applicant  “lied  .  .  .  .  by  stating  that  [he]
inadvertently exposed [himself] to [his] daughter, while, in truth, [he] deliberately had [his]
daughter touch [his] genitals.” The summary of interview states, in relevant part, only that
“[Applicant] exposed self to daughter.” It then goes on to recount what happened after
Applicant’s conduct became known to his wife and he was convicted of indecency with a
child. The summary of the January 2017 interview does not reflect any discussion of his
intent  at  the  time  of  his  misconduct.  In  short,  there  is  no  basis  for  the  Government’s
allegation  that  Applicant  intended  to  make  a  false  statement  or  representation  about
anything material to an examination of his sexual behavior with daughter. (GX 5; Tr. 60)
During Applicant’s probation, he complied with all of the court-ordered conditions
of his sentence. He paid all fines and costs, completed his community service, and he
has  not  violated  any  laws  or  ordinances  since  his  conviction.  He  also  received  court-
ordered sex offender counseling during which he examined not only his own conduct, but
factors that may have contributed to it. Prominent among those factors was Applicant’s
own  experience  as  a  victim  of  sexual  molestation.  Applicant  has  not  sought  or  been
referred for any additional counseling or treatment since 2010. Applicant also avers that
he  now  has  a  good  relationship  with  his  daughter.  Additionally,  Applicant  has  a  good
reputation for reliability with his current employer. (AX A; Tr. 31, 38 – 39, 55 – 56, 63)
