Applicant is 67 years old, and had three children during two marriages that ended
in divorce. Neither former husband paid her any child support. She earned an associate’s
degree in 1994, a bachelor’s degree in 1996, and a master’s degree in 2007. She applied
for  a  trustworthiness  determination  in  connection  with  starting  her  contract  work  in
December 2017 as a counselor at a Navy Fleet and Family Services Center. She has
never served in the military or worked in the Federal civil service. (GE 1; Tr. 15-17, 40-
42.)
From October 1999 to May 2016, Applicant worked as a domestic violence legal
victim advocate in the Human Resource Department of a Native American Tribe. She was
then laid off, through no fault of her own, when her position was eliminated due to lack of
work. When she was laid off she was earning about $92,000 per year. (GE 1; GE 6; Tr.
39, 48-49.)
In  December 1995,  Applicant  purchased  a home for about  $200,000  with funds
that  she  inherited  from  her  parents’  estate.  In  2000  and  2005,  respectively,  she
mortgaged  and  refinanced  this  property  to  withdraw  equity  funds.  In  2009,  during  the
financial collapse and mortgage financing turmoil, she lost the home through foreclosure.
She spent about $40,000 on legal fees in her unsuccessful attempt to retain ownership
of her home. (GE 1; GE 6; Tr. 42-43, 53.)
Applicant’s  bankruptcy  court record  indicates  that  she  and  her second  husband
filed bankruptcy proceedings in September 1985 that were closed in September 1988.
She  then  filed  bankruptcy  proceedings  herself  in  October  1988  and  April  2002,  which
were closed in February 1989 and February 2005, respectively. These actions were not
alleged as security concerns in the SOR, and no further detail concerning the proceedings
was made a matter of record. (GE 2; Tr. 26, 28.)
Applicant most recently filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in April 2014,
seeking to resolve $117,349 in unsecured nonpriority claims, and $59,246 in U.S. Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) claims. She was in compliance with her five-year bankruptcy plan
until June 2016, after she was laid off from the $92,000-per-year victim advocacy position
she had held for more than 15 years. This bankruptcy was finally dismissed and closed
in  March  2017  when  she  could  not  afford  to  continue  making  plan  payments  despite
applying  for unemployment  compensation  and  early  Social  Security  benefits.  (Answer;
GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 28, 39-40.)
The IRS filed a $19,533 federal tax lien against Applicant in March 2014, shortly
before her latest bankruptcy filing. She attributed her tax debt to having insufficient funds
withheld during several years when she worked two jobs at the same time, but did not
provide further details. She said that she had been in telephonic contact with the IRS, but
was  unsuccessful  in  reaching  an  agreement  that  could  resolve  her  tax  delinquencies.
(Answer; GE 1; GE 3; GE 6; Tr. 52-54.)
The SOR alleged that five of Applicant’s student loan accounts, totaling $26,710,
had  been  placed  for  collection.  In  her  March  2019  Answer,  Applicant  denied  these
allegations and said the accounts were then in a good-standing repayment status with a
different  loan  servicing  agency.  She  provided  documentation  at  the  hearing  which
confirmed that statement; and further documentation that on August 21, 2019, the agency
granted  her  request  for  forbearance  of  payments  toward  her  outstanding  $24,952
principal balance  until December 28, 2019. Although  no  payments  toward  these  loans
were  documented,  she  provided  a  statement  showing  that  she  had  fully  repaid  five
student loans she opened from 1995 to 1997, which totaled $18,772. (Answer; GE 1; GE
3; GE 6; AE A; AE B; AE C; Tr. 38, 48, 52.)
As alleged in the SOR, and admitted by Applicant, she has at least 15 delinquent
medical debts, ranging from $59 to $226 and totaling $2,046. She denied owing four other
SOR-alleged  medical debts  totaling  $555 that  had been placed for collection;  claiming
they were probably duplicates of her admitted delinquent medical bills although none of
the  amounts  due  were  the  same.  These  medical  debts  appear  to  be  relatively  small
ancillary or co-pay charges, many of which resulted from her recent operation to address
a heart-related condition.  Applicant also has eight consumer credit accounts that were
placed for collection or charged off, totaling $6,715. She provided no evidence indicating
progress toward resolving any of these accounts, or the means to do so.
Applicant  declined  to  provide  a  financial  statement  with  details  concerning  her
income, living expenses, and plans for debt repayment. She said her financial troubles
were ongoing, despite her frugal lifestyle while commuting a long distance every day with
an old vehicle to work at her job that pays $18.72 per hour. (TR. 49-54.)
Applicant  is  a  person  of  excellent  character.  Her  testimony  was  honest  and
straightforward.  Her  pastor  testified  at  length  about  her  outstanding  integrity,  caring
nature, and dedication to caring for others. She is an important officer in her church, and
has  overcome  numerous  setbacks  and  hardships  through  two  difficult  marriages  and
several  employment  setbacks.  She  has  received  numerous  academic  and  community
awards, honors, and other forms of recognition for her achievements. (AE D; Tr. 41-43,
45-48.)
