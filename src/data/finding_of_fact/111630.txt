The  SOR  identified  ten  allegations  under  this  guideline  concerning  Applicant’s
failure  to  file  his  Federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2016,  2017,  and
2018; back taxes owed as a result; and a number of delinquent debts that were placed
for collection.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits allegations 1.a., through 1.d.,
and  he  denied  the  remaining  allegations,  1.e.,  through  1.j.,  asserting  that  they  have
been paid.
Applicant’s employment history includes at least two instances of termination and
one  of  resignation  prior  to  his  termination.    The  cause  for  his  termination  from
employment  from  his  job  in  2015  also  resulted  in  suspension  of  his  Merchant  Marine
License for six months upon agreement with the Coast Guard.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
He has an extensive history of unemployment, starting most recently and then working
backwards,  from  November  2013  to  January  2014;  July  2013  to  October  2013;  April
2013 to June 2013; April 2012 to March 2013; November 2010 to March 2012; August
2009  to  August  2010; May  2008  to  June 2009;  and from  February  2007  to  July  2007.
Applicant began working for his current employer in June 2017.  In November 2017, he
was injured on his job, and has been unemployed and on disability since then.
Applicant admitted that at one time he owed approximately $14,656 in back taxes
to the State of Delaware for tax years 2010, 2012, and 2013.  As a result, in April 2008,
the State of Delaware entered a tax lien against him in the amount of $2,573.  Applicant
states  that  in  September  2017,  he  set  up  a  payment  plan  to  pay  his  Delaware  state
taxes and was making payments until he suffered a knee injury on the job in December
2017.
In  response  to  the  FORM,  Applicant  submitted  a  letter from  the  Delaware  state
tax authorities indicating that as of August 29, 2019, Applicant had a zero balance owed
toward  back  taxes.    (Applicant’s  Exhibit  A.)    Applicant  also  submitted  a  letter  he
prepared  that  stated  that  as  of  July  2,  2019,  he  had  paid  the  debts  set  forth  in
allegations  1.f., through  1.j.    These  debts  are  mainly  delinquent medical  bills that  total
approximately  $600.    He  did  not  provide  copies  of  any  receipts  or  proof  of  payments
made  to  these  creditors.    There  is  no  documentation  in  the  record  to  substantiate  the
fact that his delinquent debts have been paid.
Applicant  has  not  yet  filed  his  Federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2016,
2017,  and  2018.    There  is  also  no  evidence  in  the  record  that  he  has  filed  his  state
income tax returns for tax years 2016, 2017, and 2018.  He has no excuse for not timely
filing these income tax returns.
