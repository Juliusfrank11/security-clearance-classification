Applicant admitted the SOR financial allegations, except SOR 1.g, 1.i, and 1.j. On
my own motion, I amended SOR 1.d to correctly reflect that it was a Federal income tax
lien, not a state lien, in accordance with GE 6. Applicant is a 60-year-old operations lead
contracted to a U.S. defense contractor since July 2014. He  was briefly unemployed May-
July  2014,  while   a  bid  protest  was  resolved,  having  been  first  contracted  to  the  same
employer in  April 2014.  He  was contracted to a different defense contractor from June
2007 to March 2014. He  seeks to retain the clearance  he was issued in  May  2009 (GE
1).
Applicant married in March 1987, and had two children with his wife, an adult son
and an adult daughter. However, in the 1990s, he became involved with another woman,
and  had  three  children  with  her:  two  adult  daughters,  and  a  soon-to-be-20  son.  He  is
away  at  college,  but  will  soon  be  moving  home  to  attend  a  closer  college.  Applicant=s
oldest  son,  wife,  and  grandchild  live  with  Applicant,  as  do  both  Applicant=s  younger
daughters (GE 1).
Applicant=s earlier employment history is a bit hazy. He describes starting his own
company in about 2002, with about 15 employees, and a single, big client, but that ended
abruptly in about 2003 (Tr. 29-30). He then got a job with a Government contractor. In
about 2005, he started up his company again, as a vehicle for contracting his services,
and continued to work for his previous employer. He used a commercially-available tax
preparation software to do his taxes (Tr. 31). In late 2011, the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS)  audited  him  for  tax  years  2008-2010,  and  disallowed  a  number  of  business
deductions, which left him with a large tax liability. In spring 2012, Applicant experienced
a medical condition that required surgery, and a week=s hospital stay. Over the next few
years,  he  spent  another  three  weeks  in  the  hospital  (Tr.  32-33).  In  2012,  he  was  also
diagnosed  with  depression.  Nevertheless,  he  did  what  he  could  to  address  his  tax
indebtedness.
The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his 2010, 2011, and 2016 state
and Federal income tax returns. Applicant reported this on his December 2017 clearance
application  (GE  1),  asserting  that  he  had  made  payment  arrangements  on  his
approximately $22,000 combined 2010 debt, and satisfied the debt in August 2016, had
made  payment  arrangements  on  his  approximately  $28,000  combined  2011  debt  in
August 2015, and was paying $3,350 monthly, and was making payment arrangements
for  his  approximately  $23,000  combined  2016  tax  debt.  He  also  reported  a  $1,300
medical debt. All the SOR debts are listed in Applicant=s January 2018 credit report (GE
2).  They  do  not  appear  in  Applicant=s  November  2018  credit  report  (GE  4)  because  it
reports accounts with one credit bureau, and not the bureau that reported those debts on
GE 2.
Applicant later acknowledged that he also failed to timely file his 2012-2014 state
and Federal income  tax returns  (AE B,  Tab  A.  3).  Although these  tax issues  were  not
alleged  in  the  SOR  [because  Applicant  did  not  disclose  them  on  his  December  2016
clearance  application  (GE  1)  or  during  his  March  2018  interview  with  a  Government
investigator (GE 3)], I cannot consider them on the merits of this case, but I can consider
them for evidence of absence of mistake and other purposes.
Applicant  discussed  his  tax  filing  issues,  and  delinquent  debts,  during  a  March
2018 interview with a Government investigator (GE 3). Applicant stated that he had made
payment arrangements with the medical creditors at SOR 1.h-1.j, and was current on his
payments. He also stated that he had made payment arrangements with the IRS for tax
years  2010,  2011,  and  2016,  and  was  making  payments.  Applicant  attributed  his  tax
issues solely to his inability to make the large lump-sum payments required to satisfy his
tax liabilities. He repeated this explanation to the Government investigator.
Applicant provided a May 2019 printout listing official payments to the IRS and the
state beginning in June 2012 through a single payment in May 2018 (AE B, Tab A.4). The
payments were irregular, and it appears that Applicant entered into multiple installment
agreements  with  the  IRS,  with  varying  degrees  of  constancy  and  success.  From
September 2014 through May 2015 he made regular required payments; June 2015 he
made a partial payment; he made the July 2015 payment with two checks; and the same
with  August  2015;  he made  the  September  payment  late;  missed  the  November  2015
payment; made the December 2015 payment on time; then no installment payment until
May 2018.
Applicant=s tax  year 2010  IRS account transcript (AE B, Tab  A.1) shows that his
tax  return was filed only a month  late.  It largely confirms the  official payments records,
but  also  shows  a  large  gap   in   payments  between  August  2015   and   June  2017.  The
resumption of  payments in  June 2017  lasted until  May 2018, although several of the  2018
payments were dishonored and  had  to be made up. Applicant paid over $69,000 to the
IRS,  and   as  of   May   2019   owes only  accrued interest   and   penalties.  His  2011   account
transcript shows a $61,759.44 balance  as of May 2019  (AE B, Tab  A.2);  his 2012, 2013,
and   2014  tax   transcripts  show   balances  of  $56,913.57,  $47,900.38,  and   $11,223.39,
respectively (AE B, Tab A.3). Applicant did not provide a tax transcript for 2016.
As a result of his failure to timely file  these returns,  in  March 2013, the Federal
government obtained  a $141,017.68 tax  lien  for tax  years 2009-2011 (SOR 1.d)(GE 6),
and  in  January 2014 obtained  a $39,918.63  tax  lien for  tax  year 2012  (SOR 1.c)  GE 5),
for  $180,939 total  Federal  tax  liens. In August 2012, the state filed a $39,369.11 tax  lien
for  tax  years 2009-2010, which  Applicant  paid  in  March  2018, before the SOR  was issued
(SOR 1.f)GE 7). In February 2013, the state  filed a $12,596.72 tax  lien for  tax year 2011
(SOR 1e)(GE 7). GE 7 also reports tax  liens  for 2005, 2012, and  2013, that were satisfied
before  the  SOR  was  issued.  However,  GE  7  also  reports  a  March  2019  state  lien  of
$87,345.06 for tax years 2009-2014.
Also alleged in the SOR were a delinquent child support account (SOR 1.g) and
three delinquent medical accounts (SOR 1.h-1.i). Applicant produced an April 2019 child
support record that showed no arrears as of January 2017 (the reported delinquencies
were  dated  2015)(AE  B,  Tab  G).  He  produced  an  April  2019  letter  from  the  SOR  1.h
creditor, showing a pending monthly payment for May 2019 (AE B, Tab H). He produced
a February 2019 letter from the SOR 1.i creditor, showing the account paid in full (AE B,
Tab I). He produced a May 2019 letter from the SOR 1.j creditor, showing the account
paid in full (AE B, Tab J).
In May  2018, Applicant hired a professional tax  relief company to help him deal
with Federal and  state  issues, and  appointed it as his  representative (AE B, Tab  A.5).
Applicant=s tax  transcripts reflect  the appointment of  a representative around that time. In
May  2019,  the  representative  provided  Applicant=s  current  tax   status  (AE  B,  Tab   A.6).
Applicant  has  filed  all   his  Federal   income   tax   returns  through  2017,  owes  the  IRS
$190,765Cof which  he has paid  $1,000Cand expects to have  an installment agreement
within the next 30-60 days (or  approximately the end  of July 2019). The  due  date for his
2019  return  has  been  extended  to  October  2019.  Applicant  is  compliant  with  IRS
requirements,   which   is  what  makes  him  eligible  for   an  installment  agreement.  The
representative  estimates  his  required  monthly  payment  between   $2,500-$3,500.  The
representative did not provide  a current status for  Applicant=s state tax  issues. Applicant
claimed to have had a repayment plan with the state until February  2018, when the state
tried  to  withdraw  over  $99,000  from  his   bank  account  (AE  B,  Tab   B).  Applicant
documented the attempted withdrawal  (AE B, Tab  B.1), but no prior  payments. AE  B, Tab
A.4  documents  only  a  handful  of  payments  to   the  state,   none  after   September  2015.
Applicant=s  final   state   tax   liability  is  undetermined.  He   produced  the  actual   lien  of
judgment for unpaid state tax  showing $87,345.06 due as of  February 2019, for  tax  years
2009 through 2014 (AE B, Tab D.1).
Applicant=s work and character references [three recent work references from the
Government agency Applicant supports and a long-standing friend (AE A)], all consider
Applicant honest and trustworthy, and recommend him for his clearance. Only the friend
is aware of the SOR issues and Applicant=s health issues, but he also comments favorably
on  Applicant=s  community  involvement.  It  does  not  appear  that  Applicant  has  received
credit  or  financial  counseling.  He  provided  a  budget  that  shows  $101  positive  monthly
cash flow, after providing for a $3,500 payment on lien or judgment (presumably the IRS),
and a $1,300 payment to other (presumably the state lien).
