Applicant admitted SOR financial allegations 1.b, 1.d-1.n, and 1.p. She denied the
remaining financial allegations and the falsification allegation. She is a 38-year-old junior
program  analyst  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  August  2015.  She  was
employed in a similar position from October 2006 to April 2010, when she left because of
employment  discrimination  related  to  her  medical  issues,  and  from  November  2010  to
June 2014, when she left voluntarily Thus, she was unemployed with medical issues April-
November 2010, and voluntarily from June 2014 to August 2015.. Applicant has never
married, and has a 15-year old son. She has not previously held a clearance, although
she discovered as part of this clearance process that a previous employer had submitted
a clearance request that had not been processed before she left that employment.
The SOR alleges, and GE 1-5 substantiate, 27 delinquent debts totaling almost
$44,000.  Applicant  admits  13  debts  totaling  almost  $27,000.  Applicant  reported  one
resolved debtCnot at issue in the  SORCon her September 2015 clearance application
(GE 1), but failed to report the remaining debts, resulting in the falsification  allegation.
She was confronted with these debts, and discussed them, during subject interviews with
a Government investigator on 15 October 2015, 2 March 2016, and 16 May 2016 (GE 2),
based on her September 2015 credit report (GE 3). She asserted that she was unaware
of these debts until she was confronted by the investigator.
Applicant=s debt denials appear to be related to the fact that SOR debts 1.a and
1.c  do  not   appear  on  the  three  February  2019  credit  reports   she  submitted  with  her
Answer, a claimed, but not documented, dispute with the SOR 1.o creditor,  and  her claim
that SOR 1.q-1.aa debts were resolved. She also claimed to be working on a settlement
amount with the SOR 1.k creditor, without corroboration.
The   delinquent  debts  comprise  an  $18,769  automobile  debt  (SOR  1.k),  15
delinquent   medical   debts  totaling  $9,053  (SOR  1.a-1.h,  1.t,   and  1.v-1.aa),   and   11
delinquent   consumer  credit  accounts  (SOR  1.i-1.j,  and  1.l-1.s  and   1.u).  Applicant=s
Answer  included   February  2019  debt  validation  letters  to  each   of  the  creditors  for   the
admitted  debts,   except  for  the  automobile  loan   at  SOR  1.k.   However,   the  letters  were
generic, not identifying the dates of the derogatory credit reports, any account  balances,
account numbers, or  previous creditors.  She sent no letters to any  of the creditors  for the
debts she denied.
Of  the 15 medical  debts alleged (SOR 1.a-1.h, 1.t, and 1.v-1.aa), 13 were for  the
same medical  provider  and  held by the same creditor (SOR 1.b-1.h, 1.t,  and  1.w-1.aa).
During her subject interviews, she acknowledged  that she received  the medical  treatment
recorded, but asserted that she either had  insurance to cover the bill  or was receiving
coverage through the state. Nevertheless, she stated that she would investigate the debts
and  pay any balance  owed. She claimed, without corroboration, that the amount alleged
in  SOR debt 1.k  was incorrect,  and that she was working with the  creditor  to  arrange a
repayment plan. She generally acknowledged the non-medical  debts,  stating specifically
that she planned to pay SOR debt 1.i within the next six  months, would pay SOR debt
1.m  within the next 6-12 months,  and  had  her father pay  SOR debt 1.n. She asserted that
SOR debt 1.o was fraud by a former roommate.  However,  her  father had  not paid SOR
debt 1.n, and  she took no documented action on any of the debts she discussed with the
investigator.
Applicant=s  February  2019  creditor  letters  garnered  some  responses  from  the
creditors. On 25 April 2019, Applicant settled SOR debts 1.b-1.hCincluding the SOR 1.c
debt that she had previously deniedCat a 50% discount (AE A). On 15 March 2019, the
SOR 1.i collection agent stated that it was ceasing collection on the account and would
have it removed from her credit file, despite Applicant having previously admitted this debt
(AE B). On 24 April 2019, Applicant settled SOR debt 1.j at a one-third discount (AE C).
In  February  2019,  Applicant  documented  some  sporadic  payments  on  the  automobile
loan  at  SOR  1.k  between  July  2016  and  November  2018,  along  with  a  two-payment
settlement amount at a substantial discount, due in late May and late June 2019 (AE D).
In April 2019, the SOR 1.l creditor agreed to accept $800 in settlement of the debt, now
grown to over $2,500; Applicant provided a copy of a May 2019 check for that amount,
payable to the creditor (AE E). In March 2019, the SOR 1.m collection agent stated that
it had stopped collection action on the account, but would continue to report any account
activity to the credit bureaus (AE F). On 23 April 2019, the SOR 1.n creditor reported that
Applicant  had  completed  a  settlement  payment  at  a  40%  discount  (AE  G).  Applicant
received no response from the SOR debt 1.p collection agent, but provided a March 2019
update from a credit bureau reflecting that the collection agent was removing the account
from Applicant=s credit report (AE H). Applicant also documented some efforts to locate
the SOR 1.v (AE I) and SOR 1.w (AE J) collection agents, two medical debts Applicant
denied as having been resolved.
Applicant=s testimony generally followed her exhibits. She testified that she could
not  find  the  SOR  1.a  creditor,   was  disputing  the  SOR  1.o  debt  as  fraud   by  a  former
roommate, and  that the SOR 1.q-1.s creditor had  no record of any debts in  her name.
However, she corroborated none of these claims (Tr.  29). She stated that SOR  debts  1.t-
1.u (not a medical  bill) and  1.x-1.aa were all held by the same collection  agent as SOR
debts 1.b-1.h, and  the collection agent had  stated that SOR debts 1.b-1.h were the only
debts held by that agency. Applicant  claimed, again  without corroboration, that she paid
these debts in 2015 after her interview (Tr. 31, AE A).
Applicant attributed her financial problems to her unemployment periods, whether
voluntary or not, her son=s father=s sporadic payment of child support, and her mother=s
death  in  2012,  followed  in  regular  order  by  the  deaths  of  other  family  and  near-family
members. She also stated that when her living arrangements changed, her son=s father
and other roommates did not always forward her mail.
Applicant  testified  that  she  has  $600-700  positive  monthly  cash  flow,  and  her
current  job  provides  health  insurance  (Tr.  59-62).  However,  she  did  not  provide  any
budget. Moreover, she did not provide any evidence of any financial or credit counseling
she may have received. She provided no work or character references, or any evidence
of community involvement.
