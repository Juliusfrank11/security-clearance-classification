Applicant, 54, is divorced, and has no children. She graduated from high school in
1983 and attended one semester of college. She was previously married from 2004 until
2012. She  worked for defense  contractors  and held  a  security  clearance from 2002 to
2010.  As  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  was  unemployed  but  had  a  pending  start  date  in
December 2019 with a non-federal contractor. (GE 1; Tr. 10-13)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  has  24  delinquent  debts,  including  3  state  tax
liens, totaling approximately $28,631. Additionally, she failed to file her 2013 and 2014
state and federal income tax returns, as required by law. In her response to the SOR, she
admitted all  of  the  allegations,  except  SOR  ¶¶  1.e,  1.i, 1.l,  1.k,  1.u,  and  1.v.  All  of  the
debts alleged in the SOR were reported in Applicant’s March 2017 and November 2018
credit bureau reports (CBR). (Answer; GE 4; GE 5)
financial  delinquencies
Applicant  attributed  her
to  several  events  and
circumstances,  including  a  2006  car  accident,  her  2012  divorce,  various  periods  of
unemployment, her care of family members, and her own medical issues. In August 2013,
Applicant was hospitalized due to various medical issues. At that time, she was employed
and had health insurance. After she left the hospital, her employer gave her a urinalysis,
which she failed, and she was fired. Since she moved to State A in 2014, she has helped
care for her mother, who has dementia. Additionally, in the past five years, Applicant was
homeless  twice,  when  family  members  kicked  her  out  of  their  homes.  Though  she
appeared at her hearing pro se, Applicant initially hired an attorney to represent her during
the adjudication of her security clearance. She paid him over $1,300, which caused her
to fall behind  on  additional financial obligations,  including  her car payment,  which  was
repossessed in May 2019.  (GE 1; GE 6; GE 7; GE 8; GE 9; Tr. 30-43, 45, 48-49, 57)
Applicant  submitted  a  July  2019  letter  indicating  her  personal  information  may
have  been  compromised;  however,  she  provided  no  direct  information  that  any  of  the
alleged debts were invalid and were placed for collection during the period of the security
breach. (AE D)
Applicant’s tax issues started in 1989. She filed her state and federal income tax
returns,  but  was  unable  to  pay  her  tax  obligations.  She  filed  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy
protection in 1993, and her debts, other than her taxes, were discharged in 1994. In 2002,
Applicant learned that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had filed a $29,000 lien against
her.  Two  years  later,  she  entered  into  a  monthly  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS,
which she paid until 2010, when she was placed in a non-collectible status. The last time
Applicant filed her state and federal tax returns was in 2012. In 2014, she moved to State
B,  which  does  not  have  income  taxes,  and  she  stopped  communicating  with  the  IRS.
Applicant continues to owe State A $6,304 for the two tax liens filed against her in 2008
and  the  one  lien  filed  in  2013.  Applicant  initially  testified  that  she  owes  the  IRS
approximately $18,000 for tax years 2002 to present; however, later in the hearing, she
claimed  that  she  has  overpaid  her  federal  income  taxes  and  is  due  a  refund  of
approximately $10,000. (GE 1 at 41-43; GE 2; GE 3; GE 4; GE 5; GE 6 at 5; GE 9; Tr.
40-41, 50-58, 65-66)
A week before the hearing, Applicant hired a tax-service company to investigate
the status of her 1990 through 2018 state and federal income taxes. As of the date of the
hearing, Applicant had not paid the $495 to retain the tax-service company, nor did she
provide proof of payment in her post-hearing documentation. She testified that State A
put  her  in  a  hardship-deferral  for  her  three  state  tax  liens,  but  she  did  not  provide
documentation to support this claim, nor did she provide specifics as to when the deferral
was  granted.  Additionally,  after  the  hearing  Applicant  asserted  that  State  A  was
investigating the three liens, and she had agreed to set up a payment plan to begin in
December 2019. She provided no documentation to support this claim. (AE A; AE F; AE
G; Tr. 57-61)
In 2017, Applicant hired a credit-repair company to dispute and remove negative
items  from  her  credit  reports.  The  company  did  not  make  payments  to  her  various
creditors. Applicant worked with the company until a month before the hearing, because
she could no longer pay the $119 monthly fee. She testified that some of her debts were
resolved by the repair program, but because she was no longer paying the company, she
did  not  have  access  to  information  regarding  which  debts  had  been  resolved  through
dispute. At the hearing, she could not identify which SOR allegations were removed from
her CBR. (Tr. 45-48, 69-71)
In her post-hearing documentation, Applicant claimed that SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, and
1.l  through  1.y  were  all  resolved  through  dispute  or  no  longer  appeared  on  her  credit
report. However, she did not provide a copy of an updated CBR to substantiate her claims.
Additionally, the May 2019 documentation from the credit-repair company listed fourteen
debts that were deleted from her credit file, but only SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.q, 1.r, and 1.s were
identifiable.  The  documentation  also  indicated  that  Applicant  had  eight  new  negative
items in her credit file, of which SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g were identifiable. The credit-repair
company  documentation  did  not  indicate  the  basis  for  which  the  negative  items  were
removed from Applicant’s credit file. (AE F; AE G)
In  March  2011,  Applicant  was  awarded  primary  custody  of  her  niece,  who  has
cerebral palsy, due to her sister’s need for substance-abuse treatment. The guardianship
arrangement lasted for one year. She testified that some of her niece’s medical bills were
placed for collection in her name, including SOR ¶ 1.e. Applicant called the creditor a year
before  the  hearing,  but  was  advised  by  her  credit-repair  program  to  not  contact  the
creditor  again  as  the  company  was  trying  to  resolve  this  debt.  According  to  her  post-
hearing documentation, this debt was disputed and removed from her credit report. (AE
F; Tr. 45-46)
Based upon the information reported in her CBRs, SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i appear to
be duplicates of each other. In her post-hearing documentation, Applicant claimed for the
first time that SOR ¶1.f. is a duplicate of SOR ¶ 1.g. However, the debts have different
account numbers and different balances. (GE 4; GE 5; AE F)
Applicant has not made payments toward any of the debts alleged in the SOR. As
of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  she  was  not  following  a  written  budget  due  to  her
unemployment. However, she has followed one in the past. (Tr. 67)
Applicant’s 2010 SCA and credit bureau report (CBR) reflect numerous delinquent
debts.  She had  vehicles  repossessed  in  October 2011,  October  2014, and  May  2019.
Additionally, she has four high-interest personal loans that have become delinquent in the
past  year.  She  owes  additional  money  for  back  rent  at  a  former  apartment.  The
repossessions and delinquent personal loans are not alleged in the SOR. (GE 5; GE 6 at
2, 6; AE B; AE C; Tr. 25-26, 72-74, 79-81)
