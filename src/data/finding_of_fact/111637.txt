Applicant admitted all three SOR allegations, ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. His admissions
are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 38 years old. He was married from 2008 to 2013. He has no children.
He  currently  lives  with  his  girlfriend  and  her  teenage  son.  Applicant  has  some  junior
college credits and professional training. He has held jobs as an aircraft mechanic since
2004 for multiple defense contractors. Since October 2008, he has worked on rotational
deployments  in  Afghanistan,  for  60  or  90  days  at  a  time,  with  45  to  60  days  off  in
between. Applicant had worked for his current employer for about a year and a half at
the  time  of  the  hearing.  He  has  had  a  clearance  since  about  2007.  (Tr.  10-11;  33-35;
GE 1)
Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his federal  income  tax  returns,  as  required,  for  tax
years 2014, 2015, and 2016. At one point he had past-due federal income tax debt for
those years of over $100,000. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c)
Applicant  said  it  was  common  practice  among  his  deployed  co-workers  to
change  their  federal  tax  withholding  status  to  “exempt”  late  in  the  year.  The  purpose
was to increase their paychecks temporarily, so as to have more money for Christmas.
(Tr.  44,  52,  81-82)  During  one  of  his  deployments  in  2014,  Applicant  changed  his  tax
withholding status to exempt. Though he initially intended it to be temporary, he failed to
change his exemption status back until 2017. (Tr. 56, 61)
Applicant  said  that  he  initially  changed  his  withholding  status  by  submitting  a
revised W-4 form to a company administrator. When he went back later to change it, he
said  he  had  to  do  it  on  a  company  computer.  He  said  he  was  unable  to  effect  the
change because the computer connection from Afghanistan was poor, so after a while
he gave up trying. (Tr. 65-66, 80) He acknowledged, however, that he could have made
the re-adjustment to his W-4 while he was home on rotational leave, but did not do so.
(Tr. 84)
Applicant  asserted  that,  once  he  exempted  all  his  income,  whether  he  would
actually qualify for an overseas exemption (of $90,000, he said) would depend on who
his  tax  preparer  was,  and  what  they  told  him  about  whether  or  not  he  qualified.
However,  he  also  acknowledged  being  told  that  he  did  not  qualify  for  an  overseas
exemption, which explained his high tax bills. (Tr. 44-46)
GE  4  is  a  blank  copy  of  an  IRS  form  W-4  from  2014,  like  the  one  Applicant
prepared. Box 7 contains the following language (emphasis in original), followed by the
signature block:
I claim exemption from withholding for 2014, and I certify that I meet both
of the following conditions for exemption:
  Last  year  I  had  a  refund  of  all  federal  income  tax  withheld  because  I
had no tax liability, and
  This year I expect a refund of all federal income tax withheld because I
had no tax liability. If you meet both conditions, write “Exempt” here.
Under  penalties  of  perjury,  I  declare  that  I  have  examined  this  certificate
and,  to  the  best  of  my  knowledge  and  belief,  it  is  true,  correct,  and
complete.
Applicant  acknowledged  that,  for  tax  year  2013  and  2014,  he  owed  and  paid
taxes,  so  he  did  not  have  a  right  to  a  refund  due  to  having  no  tax  liability.  He
acknowledged that in signing the W-4 in 2014, he had asserted that his answers were
true, when, in fact, he knew they were false. (Tr. 53-56, 60-61; GE 4, GE 5)
By  treating  all  of  his  income  as  tax  exempt,  Applicant  had  no  income  taxes
withheld for part of 2014, all of 2015, and all of 2016. He then did not timely file his 2014
tax  return.  He  acknowledged  that  had  he done  so,  it  would  have  become  clear to  him
that  he  was  not  exempt  since  he  earned  far  too  much  income.  (Tr.  62-63;  GE  5  (an
excerpt from an IRS publication noting that any single filer earning more than $10,300
could not be exempt from taxes)).
Applicant earned $158,000 in 2014, $195,000 in tax year 2015, and $140,000 in
2016. He had no taxes withheld for either year. The exemption remained in place until
he changed it in 2017. (Tr. 59, 62)
Beginning  in  April  2015,  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his federal  tax  returns  for
three straight years. He testified at hearing that when he was deployed during tax time,
it was difficult to address his taxes in a timely manner. He knew that the federal tax filing
deadline is April 15 each year, and he said he filed an extension in 2015. But he did not
file  his  2015  tax  return  because  he  was  busy  and  forgot.  (Tr.  37-38;  GE  1)  He  also
received correspondence from the IRS each year about his unfiled tax returns and past-
due taxes, yet took no action. (GE 2 at 5; Tr. 64, 66-68)
At the time of the April 15, 2016 tax deadline, Applicant “freaked out” with anxiety
about  dealing  with  it,  so  he  put  it  off.  (Tr.  40,  66)  He  disclosed  his  tax  issues  on  his
SCA, which he filled out  in June 2016. He disclosed that he had failed to file his 2014
and  2015  federal  income  tax  returns,  and  estimated  owing  about  $10,000  in  past-due
taxes for each year. He said he was working on resolving the problem. (GE 1 at 33-34;
Tr. 36-37) He acknowledged that his SCA was what spurred him to act. (Tr. 40-42; GE 1
at 33-34)
However, Applicant also failed to timely file his 2016 tax return by the April 2017
deadline.  In  2017,  he  hired  a  tax  preparer  to  address  his  unfiled  taxes.  Applicant
claimed that his tax preparer told him that his 2016 tax return, filed in December 2017,
was not late, because the IRS had granted a filing extension to State 1 residents (such
as Applicant) since State 1 was impacted by Hurricane Irma. (GE 2 at 5; Tr. 41-42, 88)
However, while the IRS did grant such an extension – until January 31, 2018 -- it did not
do so until September 15, 2017. (GE 6) By that time, Applicant’s 2016 federal income
tax return, due on April 15, 2017, was already late, unless he had filed a request for an
extension (which he didn’t). (GE 3; Tr. 89-96)
With the assistance of his tax preparer, Applicant filed his 2014, 2015, and 2016
federal  income  tax  returns  in  late  December  2017.  (GE  3,  Tr.  43,  69)  He  was  then
notified by the IRS that he owed about $130,000 in past-due taxes for the tax years at
issue. While he initially considered a monthly repayment plan, he took money out of his
401(k)  fund  and  paid  the  taxes  back  in  bulk.  (Tr.  71-72;  GE  6  at  6)  The  status  of
Applicant’s late-filed returns and past-due taxes, as alleged in the SOR, is as follows:
SOR  ¶  1.a  (2014:  Amount  alleged:  $26,636):  The  IRS  assessed  penalties  and
interest  relating  to  the  late  filing.  In  mid-February  2019,  Applicant  made  a  lump-sum
payment  of  $26,149.  After  additional  adjustments  to  penalties  and  interest,  he  was
issued a refund of about $1,945 in mid-March 2019. (GE 3 at 1-2)
SOR  ¶  1.b  (2015:  Amount  alleged:  $65,190):  The  IRS  assessed  penalties  and
interest relating to the late filing. He received a large credit from his 2017 tax payment.
In mid-February 2019, Applicant made a lump-sum payment of about $56,660. In March
2019, he was assessed about $6,000 in additional penalties and interest. (GE 3 at 3-4)
His IRS account transcript for tax year 2017 reflects a $13,551 credit transferred out to
his 2015 taxes in April 2018. (GE 3 at 7) As of March 2019, he had a zero balance for
the 2015 tax year. (GE 3 at 3) (Tr. 48)
SOR  ¶  1.c  (2016:  Amount  alleged:  $40,128):  The  IRS  assessed  penalties  and
interest  relating  to  the  late  filing.  In  mid-February  2019,  Applicant  made  a  lump-sum
payment of about $44,520. In March 2019, he was assessed about $5,100 in additional
penalties  and  interest.  As  of  April 2019,  he  had  a  zero  balance  for  the  2015  tax  year.
(GE 3 at 5-6)
Applicant filed his 2017 federal income tax returns on or about April 15, 2018 (on
time). As of May 2018, he had a zero balance for the 2017 tax year. (GE 3 at 7)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  did  not  save  the  money  he  was  not  paying  in
taxes. He figured his tactic would catch up to him eventually, and he would address his
tax debt through a payment plan. (Tr. 78-79) He testified that by resolving his federal tax
debts by taking early withdrawals from his 401(k) funds, this in turn, caused additional
tax consequences, for the 2019 tax year. He said he  has an extra $500 withheld from
his  pay  to  account  for  that.  (Tr.  47-48-51,  72,  86,  107;  AE  B,  AE  C)  It  is  unclear,
however, what the tax consequences might be for the early withdrawals from his 401(k).
Applicant  acknowledged  his  actions,  said  it  was  a  mistake,  and  said  he  “didn’t
handle it well.” He also noted that his tax returns had been filed and his debts paid. (Tr.
49)
Applicant currently earns between $140,000 and $150,000 a year. (Tr. 72-73) He
owns several used cars. He purchased his most recent car in 2016, for about  $28,000
or  $30,000.  He  has  a  monthly  payment.  He  also  bought  a  $25,000  boat,  in  2015,  for
which he also has a monthly payment. (Tr. 73-75)
Applicant’s  supervisor  since  2010  provided  a  reference  letter  attesting  to  his
outstanding performance, dependability, and professional demeanor. Other professional
to  Applicant’s  character,
letters  attesting
and  personal
professionalism, dependability, and trustworthiness. (AE A)
