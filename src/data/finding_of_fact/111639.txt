Applicant  is  a  48-year-old  protective  security  officer  who  has  served  in  that
profession  for  different  entities  since  2004.  She  has  completed  nearly  100  college
credits.  Twice  divorced  and  remarried,  she  has  four  children  in  their  20s.  At  issue  are
18  federal  and  state-related  tax  issues  (SOR  allegations  ¶¶  1.a-1.q,  1.u),  including
failure  to  timely  file  multiple  federal  and  state  tax  returns,  and  three  delinquent
commercial accounts (SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.r-1.t). In sum, nearly $70,000 of delinquent
taxes and  delinquent  debts  are  at  issue,  with  almost  $58,000 related to  taxes  and  the
balances related to a medical account ($2,117), a charged off credit card ($2,347), and
about $4,774 past due on a student loan with a total balance of $86,210.
In  2004,  Applicant  divorced  her  second  husband.  The  resultant  lack  of  housing
and financial distress led her to a three-month period of homelessness (December 2007
to March 2008) while taking care of her children. (Tr. 21, 53) Related financial problems
lasted  until  at  least  2009,  when  some  of  her  children  went  to  live  elsewhere  and  she
was obligated to pay child support. Meanwhile, she failed to timely file federal and state
tax returns. Applicant’s main focus had been “trying to survive,” caring for her children,
maintaining long hours associated with her work, and, occasionally, taking second jobs.
(Tr. 40)
Applicant did not know she could seek an extension to file her taxes. (Tr. 21, 49)
As  a  result,  “personal  responsibility  to  take  care  of  [her]  administrative  paperwork  .  .  .
fell  by  the  wayside.”  (Tr.  51)  She  noted  that  “during  [her]  challenges,  unfortunately,
paying the taxes became secondary to initial survival and recovery.” (Tr. 52)  By 2013,
she was confused as to her financial situation in terms of taxes. (Tr. 63, 67) As before,
“other  things  were  happening  in  [her]  life  and  [she]  didn’t  stay  on  top  of  it.”  (Tr.  67)
Meanwhile,  errors  with  her  taxes  and  tax  forms  were  encountered,  such  as  lost  or
missing  W-2  tax  statements  and  delays  from  employers  to  get  copies  of  needed
paperwork. (Tr. 67-68, 72)
In  sum,  federal  tax  returns  were  not  timely  filed  for  tax  years  (TY)  2004-2006,
2008-2015,  and  2017  (with  delinquent  taxes  owed  for  TYs  2008-2011  and  2013-14
amounting to about $24,200); state tax returns were not timely filed for TYs 2004, 2008-
2009, and 2012-2013 (with delinquent taxes owed for TYs 2004, 2007-2009, 2012-2013
amounting  to almost $5,000); delinquent state taxes owed to a second state for about
$1,300); and a state tax return was not timely filed to a third state for TY 2017 (to which
she owed about $7,000). Applicant testified that her tax returns for TY 2017 and 2018
were filed in April 2019. (Tr. 56)
As  for  her  federal  tax  liability  of  around  $52,000,  Applicant  initially  made  some
payments  to  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS).  (Tr.  60)  Those  proceeds,  however,
were diverted to her ex-husband by the IRS to address her child support arrearage. (Tr.
60-62)  In  2013,  a  tax  advisor  briefly  started  reviewing  Applicant’s  federal  tax  situation
before  the  job  went  to  someone  else.  (Tr.  64-65)  Tax  transcripts  suggest  zero  dollars
are currently owed for TY 2004, 2005, 2006, 2012, and 2015 due to methods such as
application  of  refunds,  but  Applicant’s  information  indicate  confusion  remains.  (Ex.  4)
After the SOR was issued in September 2019, Applicant’s present husband suggested
she revisit a tax attorney and let him attempt to negotiate and compromise with the IRS
on  the  amount  owed.  (Tr.  56,  65-66,  71;  Ex.  L)  The  attorney  initiated  that  action  in
September 2019, shortly before the hearing. (Tr. 57, 74; Ex. Q) At present, the attorney
is trying to get her federal tax situation contained and resolved. (Tr. 85)
That  attorney  is  also  working  with  Applicant’s  state  tax  issues,  a  job  he  initially
started in 2013 before personal “life issues” arose that diverted him from her case. (Tr.
69-71)  Applicant’s  tax  liability  to  her  primary  state,  the  approximately  $5,000  at  issue,
was initially reviewed by the tax advisor. Actual progress on that state’s taxes, however,
was successfully initiated and made by that state in and after 2013. The state’s efforts
brought Applicant’s tax balance owed to that state to zero through garnishment and tax
refunds. (Ex. E; Tr. 87-89).
The  attorney  is  also  working  on  her  state  tax  issues  with  a  second  state.  The
second  state’s  tax  liability  was  inadvertently  satisfied  when  payments  to  a  third  state
were misapplied by Applicant’s employer (SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.o-1.p for about $1,335).
(Tr.  103)  They  were  for  delinquent  taxes  dating  back  to  2014  and  2015.  (Tr.  74)  This
followed Applicant’s initiation of an installment repayment plan in June 2019, reflected at
Ex.  H.  (Tr.  75)  She  testified  that  she  also  had  been  making  regular  payments  toward
those  balances  through  her  online  bank  account,  but  she  provided  no  documentation
reflecting  such  payments.  (Tr.  75)  She  also  testified  that  the  state  at  issue  has  no
records of her employer paying certain taxes to it on her behalf. (Tr. 76) The attorney is
also handling the tax issue involving a third state. For that state, Applicant testified that
a belated tax return was filed, but she is awaiting a refund from another state to satisfy
the balance owed. (Tr. 91)
With  regard  to  a  student  loan  account  noted  at  SOR  allegation  ¶  1.r,  Applicant
showed that she consolidated her student loans in May 2019. (Tr. Ex. B-C; Tr. 77) She
was approved in October 2019, the day before the hearing, to be in forbearance on the
account  through  May  2020  in  order  to  work  on  her  tax  issues.  (Ex.  B;  Tr.  76-77)
Applicant testified she has been making payments on a charged off credit card, noted at
SOR allegation ¶ 1.s for $2,437, but provided no documentation of such payments after
the hearing. (Tr. 78) A medical debt, noted at SOR allegation ¶ 1.t from 2016 for $2,117
has been satisfied. (Ex. A; Tr. 81)
Applicant  and  her  husband  own  their  home  on  which  they  pay  a  mortgage.
Applicant’s personal financial statement shows a net monthly remainder of $7,638, with
assets  including  the  mortgaged  home  and  about  $226,000  in  investments  and
automobiles.  (Ex.  11)  Applicant’s  husband  fully  supports  his  wife  in  addressing  her
debts and is willing to add his financial resources toward her effort to satisfy her debts
when matters are sorted and balances are clarified. (Tr. 92-98) Applicant acknowledged
that her tax debt has been “pretty much of a mess for pretty much a decade between
survival, neglect, ignorance, [and] all of that . . . [She] was so busy taking care of others
that  [she]  neglected  [herself]  and  [her]  responsibility.  .  .  .”  (Tr.  99)  At  present,  her
finances are stable and her life is peaceful. She and her husband are both committed to
resolving the accounts at issue.
