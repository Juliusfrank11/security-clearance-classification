Applicant  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.e  and  admitted  the
remaining  SOR allegations.  She  is 48  years old.  She married  in 2005 and  divorced  in
2013. She has an adult child. (Items 2, 3).
Applicant graduated from high school in 1991. She attended college from 2008 to
2013  but  did  not  earn  a  degree.  She  was  unemployed  from  March  to  April  2004  and
February  to  July  2013.  She  held  part-time  seasonal  employment  from  October  to
November  2016.  As  of  her  January  2017  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  she
worked as a dispatcher for a DOD contractor since October 2016. She has never held a
DOD security clearance. (Items 3, 4).
The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file her federal income tax returns for tax
years  2014,  2015,  and  2016,  as  required.  It  also  alleges  that  she  has  six  delinquent
consumer debts, totaling $3,091. She listed her failure to file her relevant federal income
tax returns and some of her delinquent consumer debt on her January 2017 SCA, and
discussed her financial issues during her November 2017 interview  with a background
investigator  and  in  her  February  2019  response  to  interrogatories.  Her  delinquent
consumer debts are also reported on her 2017 and 2019 credit bureau reports. (Items 1,
3, 4, 5, 6).
Applicant  attributed  her  financial  predicament  to  her  2013  separation  and
divorce. She stated in her response to the SOR that her divorce was an “abrupt change
[that] affected my finances tremendously and 6 years later I am still trying to recover.”
She  acknowledged  that  her  “finances  are  in  extreme  disarray,”  but  maintained  that  it
was  not  a  reflection  of  her  ability  to  do  her  job.  She  indicated  during  her  background
interview  that  she  divorced  her  husband  because  she  was  the  primary  caregiver  and
she no longer wanted to be with him as he did not work for one and a half years. (Items
2, 3, 4)
Applicant  also  indicated  in  both  her  SCA  and  background  interview  that,
unbeknownst to her until 2016, a previous employer made an erroneous change to her
IRS Form W-4 for tax years 2013 to 2016. She stated that the previous employer listed
her as having five dependents rather than one. She stated that she was waiting for that
employer  to  issue  her  corrected  IRS  Form  W-2  for  those  tax  years  so  that  she  could
“refile” those income tax returns. (Items 2, 3, 4).
In  her  response  to  interrogatories,  Applicant  stated  that  she  had  filed  her  2014
federal income tax return in January 2015, her 2015 and 2016 tax returns in April 2017,
and  her  2017  tax  return  in  January  2018.  She  stated  that  the  IRS  intercepted  her  tax
refunds for tax years 2017 and 2018 and applied them to her outstanding taxes for tax
years  2015  and  2016.  She  also  stated  that  she  still  owed  $970  for  tax  year  2015  and
$900  for  tax  year  2016,  the  latter  of  which  she  was  delinquent  by  $106.  She  did  not
provide documentation to corroborate her claims. IRS tax account transcripts from June
2019, however, reflect that no tax returns had been filed for tax periods 2014 and 2015
as of February and October 2017, respectively. A June 2019 IRS tax account transcript
for tax period 2016 simply reflected, “Requested Data Not Found.” The transcripts also
reflected  that  a  tax  return  for  tax  period  2017  was  filed  in  April  2018  and  Applicant
received a refund of $762. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5).
Applicant also discussed during her background interview a delinquent title loan
(SOR  ¶1.b)  and  two  delinquent  credit  cards  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d,  1.e).  She  indicated  that  the
creditor  for  her  title  loan  sold  her  car  for  $400  and  she  borrowed  $500.  She
acknowledged that she could not afford to repay her title loan and it, as well as her two
credit  cards,  remained  outstanding.  She  also  indicated  that  she  had  not  received  any
credit counseling. She listed in her SCA that she traveled for pleasure to Ireland and the
United Kingdom (UK) in February 2013, Ireland in March 2013, and the UK again in July
2013. (Items 2, 3, 4).
