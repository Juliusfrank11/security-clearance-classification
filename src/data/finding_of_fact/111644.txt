Applicant, 31, has worked as a security police officer for his current employer, a
federal contractor, since April 2012. He has worked in the physical security  field since
2009, when he was granted public trust eligibility. Applicant applied for his first security
clearance in 2010. He was granted an interim clearance, but it was revoked because of
his  derogatory  financial  history.  As  a  result,  Applicant  was  unemployed  from  March
2011 until April 2012, when he was able to provide sufficient information to mitigate the
concerns  raised  by  his  financial  history.  DOD  granted  Applicant  access  to  classified
information  in  April  2012.  Applicant  completed  his  most  recent  security  clearance
application  in  September  2015,  seeking  a  higher  level  security  clearance,  which  is
required  for  another  employment  opportunity.  He  reported  having  delinquent  student
loan  accounts.  The  ensuing  background  investigation  revealed  additional  delinquent
accounts, which form the basis of the SOR. The SOR alleged that Applicant owed over
$29,000  on  six  delinquent  accounts.  He  admitted  owing  each  of  the  six  alleged
accounts. (Tr. 16-17, 28-30, 42-43, 50-53; Answer; GE 1)
Applicant’s financial problems began in his early 20s. Applicant attended college
from  2006  to  2008.  He  withdrew  from  college,  and  began  working  full  time  to  provide
financial help to his mother as she raised Applicant’s two younger sisters. On average,
he gave his mother one-third of his paycheck to help her with household expenses. He
also  provided  financial  help  to  his  grandmother,  buying  her  groceries  and  prescription
medication,  as  needed.  Applicant  used  student  loans  to  pay  for  college,  which  were
serviced by multiple companies. He became overwhelmed by his financial commitments
and allowed the loans to go into default. In 2015, Applicant rehabilitated the loans and
consolidated them with one servicer. He kept the account current until December 2017,
when he defaulted on the consolidated loan, which is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a ($19,696).
(Tr. 21, 31-32, 53-56, 29; GE 1, 4-6)
When Applicant began working as a security guard in 2009, he commuted the 40
miles  from  his  mother’s  home  to  his  duty  station.  In  2013,  Applicant  moved  to  an
apartment  closer  to  his  duty  station.  Applicant,  then  25,  believed  he  was  renting  an
apartment for $1,100. When he arrived to sign the lease and move in, the rent was $600
more than he expected. Believing he had no other options, Applicant went through with
the  transaction,  knowing  that  the  rent  was  beyond  his  means.  He  lived  in  the  unit  for
less  than  six  months  before  breaking  the  lease  and  defaulting  on  the  remaining  rent
due. The balance on his lease is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e ($3,845). (Tr. 39-41, 50, 56, 60)
Between 2014 and 2017, Applicant went on six deployments to provide security
at other sites. Because Applicant did not have a credit card, his lodging expenses were
charged to his supervisor’s credit card.  Applicant’s employer deposited Applicant’s per
diem allowance directly into his bank account. On one such deployment, the hotel would
not  allow  Applicant’s  supervisor  to  pay  the  hotel  charges  over  the  phone.  Instead,
Applicant’s employer deposited the money for the hotel costs into Applicant’s checking
account. Applicant testified that he became confused when the hotel payment, his per
diem  allowance,  and  paycheck  were  deposited  into  his  account,  causing  him  to
overdraft  the  account  by  over  $4,000.  The  overdraft  balance  is  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b
($4,422). (Tr. 18, 32, 45-46, 61-62)
Applicant attributed his financial problems, in part, to his deployments. During his
deployments, which could last for months at a time, Applicant’s mail would be delivered
to  his  home  and  remain  unopened  until  his  return.  As  a  result,  Applicant  missed  due
dates  for  his  financial  obligations,  which  caused  his  accounts  to  become  delinquent.
Applicant testified that he is now much better about managing his incoming mail. He has
developed a system for dealing with his mail during any prolonged periods of absence.
He also now organizes his mail by date and tries to open it timely to ensure he does not
miss any due dates for his financial obligations. (Tr. 19-20)
The  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.c  ($1,351),  1.d  ($180),  and  1.f  ($409)  are  for
credit  cards.  The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  became  delinquent  in  May  2017,  and  the
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.f became delinquent between July and August 2017.
Applicant could not provide a reason as to why each account became delinquent other
than that he became overwhelmed and neglected to pay the accounts. He believes he
used the credit cards to pay for car repairs on his older model car. (GE 4-6)
SOR Debt Status
SOR 1.a: After defaulting on the consolidated student loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a,
Applicant  entered a  loan rehabilitation program  in  January  2019.  In  January  2020,  the
creditor  extended  Applicant  a  settlement  offer,  agreeing  to  accept  $2,459.55  to  satisfy
over $34,000 in student loan debt.  He settled the account after the hearing. (Tr. 21, 23-
24, 30; GE 4, AE D, J)
SOR 1.b: Applicant claims to have paid $800 toward this debt, testifying that he
made $100 payments each month beginning in March 2019. However, the record does
not  contain  evidence  of  these  payments.  In  January  2020,  Applicant  made  two
payments toward this debt, totaling $84. This account remains unresolved. He does not
have  payment  plan  established  for  this  debt,  but  expressed  his  intent  to  continue
making payments toward its resolution. (Tr. 24-25, 32-33; GE 5; AE E, K)
SOR  1.c:  Applicant  explained  that  he  became  overwhelmed  with  his  bills  and
stopped  making  payments  on  this  account.  Between  March  and  July  2019,  Applicant
paid  $675.50  on  this  account.  He  received  a  settlement  offer  in  November  2019  to
satisfy the account for a lump sum payment of $202.64. The offer expired on December
31, 2019. When asked at hearing why he failed to resolve the account by the deadline,
Applicant  explained  that  he  did  not  open  the  mail  containing  the  offer  until  late
December. He offered no explanation for his failure to open the letter, which he received
before  Thanksgiving,  or  his  failure  to  pay  the  settlement  amount  by  the  December  31
deadline. Applicant settled the account after the hearing.  (Tr. 25-26, 35-37, 63-66; GE
5-6; AE F, L)
SOR  1.d:    In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  stated  that  he  was  making  $50
monthly payments toward this account. However, he did not provide evidence of those
payments. At the hearing, he provided a receipt showing an account balance of $1,066
after  a  payment  of  $25  made  on  the  day  of  the  hearing.  After  the  hearing,  Applicant
submitted  a  second  receipt,  but  the  receipt  does  not  contain  any  detailed  payment
information  or  provide  an  updated  account  balance.  Applicant  has  not  established  a
payment plan for this account, and it remains unresolved. (Tr. 26, 37-38; GE 5-6; AE G,
M)
SOR 1.e: This debt is the balance on the 2013 apartment lease. Between 2014
and May 2017, Applicant made monthly payments on this account, totaling $4,000. He
did not make any payments on the account after May 2017. In January 2020, he made
two payments, totaling $130. This account remains unresolved. (Tr. 27, 14; GE 3; AE H,
N)
SOR 1.f: There is no evidence that Applicant made any payment on the account
after  it  became  delinquent  in  August  2018.  Applicant  settled  this  account  before  the
hearing. (Tr. 27, 41-42; GE 5-6; AE I, O)
Applicant earns approximately $70,000 annually, including regular and overtime
pay.  He  has  over  $5,000  in  retirement  savings,  consisting  entirely  of  the  contributions
made by his employer.  Applicant is single and has no children.  He no longer provides
regular  financial  support  to  his  mother,  but  will  give  her  money  if  she  asks.  Between
2016  and  2017,  Applicant  worked  with  a  credit  counseling  agency,  paying  them  $100
each month, to verify and challenge entries on his credit record. Applicant also provided
evidence  that  he  enrolled  in  three  financial/debt  counseling  programs.  He  submitted  a
budget  showing  that  he  intends  to  make  $100  monthly  payments  toward  the  debts
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. (Tr. 16-20, 35, 44, 63, 66, 71, 83, 85-86, 88; AE P-
