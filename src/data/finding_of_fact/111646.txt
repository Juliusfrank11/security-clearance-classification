Guideline F - Financial Considerations
that
lack  of
indicate  poor  self-control,
The  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  is ineligible  for a  clearance  because  he
made
judgment,  or
financial  decisions
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  raise  questions  about  his
reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to  protect  classified  information.  The  SOR
identified  twenty-one  separate  allegations  involving  a  variety  of  financial  problems.
Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010.  He failed to file his Federal income tax
returns  for  tax  years  2007,  2010,  2014,  and  2017.      The  Government  alleges  that  he
owes a total of approximately $66,390 in delinquent Federal taxes.  Applicant believes
the  total amount  he owes  in  Federal back  taxes  is closer to  approximately  $22,000 or
$23,000  dollars.   Applicant also failed to file his state  income  tax  returns for tax  years
2009, and 2010, and 2014 through 2017.  He owes approximately $3,514 in delinquent
state taxes.  He has ten other delinquent debts totaling approximately $9,898.  Applicant
admits to each of the delinquent accounts listed in the SOR, except 1.j., 1.k., 1.l., 1.m.,
1.p.,  1q.,  1.r.,  1.s.,  and  1.h.    Credit  Reports  of  Applicant  dated  July  6,  2017;  May  24,
2018; and October 31, 2019, confirm the indebtedness listed in the SOR.  (Government
Exhibits 5, 6, and 7.)
Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from  1986  to  October  2007
when  he  received  an  honorable  discharge.    He  retired  as  an  E-6  culinary  specialist.
During  his  military  career,  he  deployed  to  many  countries  around  the  world,  including
Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi, Australia, Guam,
Hawaii, and Samoa.
Applicant  testified  that  his  financial  problems  snowballed  over  time  because  he
did  not  pay  close  attention  to  them  while  he  was  out  at  sea.    After  retiring  from  the
military, he continued to live beyond his means.  Bills continued to come in, and he was
unable to pay them.  By 2010 his financial problems were so out of his control, he filed
for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy.    Matters  were  complicated  because  Applicant  also  failed  to
file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2009, 2010 and 2014, 2015,
2016 and 2017.  Applicant stated that there was no good reason, he simply did not file
his income tax returns.  He explained that for years while in the military, when he filled
out his W-4, he took out the maximum amount of exemptions he could, which left him
paying very little in taxes.  Thus, he always owed a lot of taxes at the end of the year.
Since  2007,  Applicant  has  changed  his  exemptions  to  prevent  this  problem.    He  now
understands the ramifications of doing this.  As of the hearing Applicant had still not filed
the Federal income tax returns in question.  (Tr. p. 32.)  Applicant had not filed his state
income tax returns in question ether.  (Tr. p. 36.)  However, he states that he has taken
care  of  his  back  taxes  owed  to  the  state.    Applicant  testified  that  he  has  contacted
several  tax  preparing  agencies,  but  each  time  they  took  his  money  and  were  not
successful  in  getting  his  taxes  filed.    His  latest  tax  preparer  has  all  of  Applicant’s
paperwork, but has not yet filed his 2018 Federal and state income tax returns.  (Tr. p.
37.)
Applicant also offered that from 2007 to 2009 he lived in Texas and he gambled
at the racetrack quite a bit.  He was unemployed from February 2012 to May 2013; and
from August 2015 to April 2016.  During those periods of unemployment, however, he
collected unemployment benefits, to live on.  He also received his military retirement as
well  as  his  90  percent  VA  disability.    (Tr.  pp.  28-29.)    The  following  delinquent  debts
remain owing:

has not started paying on this yet.  (Tr. p. 45.)
1.i.  A  Federal  tax  lien  was  entered  against  the  Applicant  in  the  amount  of
approximately $5,527 for tax year 2011.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  He states that he has

1.j  and  1.k.  Two  state  tax  liens  have  been  entered  against  the  Applicant  in  the
amount of approximately $1,767 for tax year 2010; and in the amount of approximately
$1,747 for tax year 2012.  In 2017, Applicant began following a regular payment plan of

liens are paid in full and removed.  (Tr. p. 49.)

$285.    He  believes  this  was  for  a  credit  card  that  he  has  since  paid  off.    He  has  not

1.n  Another  delinquent  debt  owed  to  a  creditor  in  the  amount  of  approximately
$2,600  was  a  loan  that  Applicant  thought  he  made  several  payments  on.    (Tr.  p.  54.)
He has not provided any documentation to substantiate these payments.  Accordingly, it
remains owing.

$4,346.  Applicant explained that this was a payday loan.  He started making payments

the payments.  He believes that he currently owes about $1,800.  He plans to resume
payments soon.  Accordingly, it remains owing.
1.q. Another delinquent debt is owed to a creditor in the amount of approximately
$1,210.    Applicant  states  that  he  was  using  his  GI  Bill  but  the  university  asserted  that
they never received payment, and the VA contends that Applicant received back pay to
pay  the  debt.    Applicant  realizes  that  he  owes  the  money.    He  has  not  made  any
attempts to pay it yet.  (Tr. p. 59.)  Accordingly, it remains owing.
1.r Another delinquent debt is owed to a creditor in the amount of approximately
$315.  This was a payday loan.  Applicant contends that this debt was paid in 2017 or

Accordingly, it remains owing.

$100.  Applicant explained that this was an overdraft charge that he paid in 2017.  He
has  not  provide  any  documentation  to  substantiate  this  payment.    Accordingly,  it
remains owing.

base.  He hopes to clear up his finances in order to purchase a house.  He now knows
how  to budget  his  money  properly.    Since  receiving  this counseling  he has  decreased
his expenses.  To reduce his expenses, he states that he no longer has a vehicle and
has cut back on cable services.
Guideline E - Personal Conduct
Applicant  completed  an  Electronic  Questionnaire  for  Investigations  Processing
(e-OIP)  dated  April  27,  2017.    (Government  Exhibit  1.)    In  response  to  Section  26
concerning his financial record, Applicant was asked a series of questions.  Specifically,
in the past seven years, has he had a lien placed against his property for failing to pay
taxes  or other debts?   Is  he  currently  delinquent  on  any  Federal debt?   The  Applicant
answered, “NO.”  This was a false response.  Applicant failed to list the debts set forth
under Guideline F, in subparagraphs 1.d., through 1k. above.  This allegation is found
against the Applicant, see discussion below.
On  the  same  questionnaire,  in  Section  26  concerning  his  financial  record,
Applicant was also asked, specifically, in the past seven years has he had bills or debts
turned over to a collection agency?... Has he had any account or credit card suspended,
charged  off or cancelled for failing  to  pay  as  agreed?   The  Applicant  answered,  “NO.”
These  were  also  false  responses.    Applicant  failed  to  list  the  debts  set  forth  under
Guideline  F,  in  1.l,  through  1.u.  above.    This  allegation  is  also  found  against  the

employee.  (Applicant’s Exhibit A.)
