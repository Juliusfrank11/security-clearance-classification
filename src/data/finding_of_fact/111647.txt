In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR  Applicant  admitted  the  factual  allegation  in
Subparagraph  1.a.,  but  denied  Subparagraph  1.b.  of  the  SOR,  with  explanations.  He
also  provided  additional  information  to  support  his  request  for  eligibility  for  a  security
clearance.
Applicant is 33 years old, is “single,” works for a defense contractor, and has held
a security clearance “since 2009.” (TR at page 18 line 17 to page 20 line 17.)
Guideline H – Drug Involvement
1.a. Applicant admits he used marijuana in about July of 2017, after having been
granted  a  security  clearance.  (TR  at  page  33  line  16  to  page  34  line  1,  and  GX  2  at
page 6.) This usage was not intentional. (TR at page 22 line 22 to page 32 line 17.) At
the  time  of  the  incident,  Applicant  was  a  heavy  cigarette  smoker.  He  had  run  out  of
cigarettes,  and  took  one  puff  from  a  co-workers  “vape  pen,”  not  knowing  it  contained
marijuana.  Applicant  only  discovered  that  the  vape  pen  contained  marijuana  when  “a
few minutes” later he “felt light-headed.” Only then did the owner of the pen disclose its
contents.  (Id.)    Applicant  self-reported  this  unintentional  usage.  (TR  at  page  39  lines
20~23, and at page 40 line 21 to page 41 line 18.) Applicant’s credibility in this regard is
attested  to  by  former and  present  colleagues  at  work.  (AppX  D.) Furthermore,  he  has
provided  a  signed  statement  of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  drug  involvement  and
substance misuse in the future. (TR at page 20 line 18 to page 21 line 4, and AppX D.)
This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.b.  Although  Applicant  does  not  remember  the  alleged  usage  more  than  18
years  ago,  I  find  that  he  used  marijuana  twice  in  August  of  2001,  as  disclosed  in  his
February 2007 e-QIP. (TR at page 21 line 5 to page 22 line 21, at page 36 line 20, and
GX 3 at page 23.) This allegation is also found for Applicant.
