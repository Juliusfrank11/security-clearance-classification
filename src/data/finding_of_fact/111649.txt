The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  owes  11  delinquent  debts  (SOR  1.a-1.k)  that
became delinquent between July 2013 and September 2018. The total amount of debt
is  $22,448.  In  2005,  he  filed  a  Chapter  13  Bankruptcy  petition  that  was  dismissed  in
2009 (SOR 1.l) after conversion to a Chapter 7. In April 2019, he filed a second Chapter
13  petition  that  is  pending  (SOR  1.m).  Applicant  admitted  all  allegations  with
explanations. All of the listed debts, except for SOR 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, and 1.k were included
in the April 2019 Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition (SOR 1.m).
Applicant is 55 years old. He was married for almost 11 years before divorcing in
2003. He has a 24-year-old daughter from this marriage. He and his partner have been
together  since  2006.  In  2004,  Applicant  obtained  an  associate’s  degree  in  electronic
engineering,  and  in  June  2019,  he  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  information
technology (IT), with a focus in cybersecurity. (GE 1 at 25-26, 29, 31, 45; Tr. 37; GE 2 at
3)
Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army (USA) from 1986 to 1994, when
he was honorably discharged. He served in the Army Reserve from 1994 to 2009.
Though  Applicant  certified  in  his  August  2017  e-QIP  that  he  had  never  been
investigated  or  held  a  security  clearance,  he  informed  the  OPM  investigator  in
December 2017 that he held a security clearance in the Army and when he worked for a
contractor in 2011. Except for one three-month period between May and August 2010,
Applicant  has  been  steadily  employed,  earning  at  least  $85,000  a  year,  since  his
discharge from the Army Reserve in 2009. (GE 1 at 25-26, 29, 31, 41, 45; Tr. 37; GE 2
at 2-3)
Applicant  filed  his  first  Chapter  13  Bankruptcy  petition  in  July  2005  (SOR  1.l)
because “I got to a point where I had more going out than I had coming in.…” (Tr. 69)
He indicated that he filed the petition to save his house. His former wife had incurred a
large  amount  of  debt  which  he  had  to  pay  under  the  terms  of  his  divorce  decree  in
October 2003. The decree required him to pay $368 a month in child support. GE 5 at
11, 23-26; Tr. 69-73)
The  Chapter  13  petition  was  converted  to  a  Chapter  7  in  May  2009  after  the
mortgage  company  found  an  investor  who  purchased  Applicant’s  house  and  several
other houses in the area. He conceded that he had not been making payments regularly
under  the  Chapter  13  petition  plan.  The  Chapter  7  petition  was  dismissed  in  October
2009 because Applicant was not appearing at bankruptcy meetings after he moved out
of  the  state.  Though  he  claims  he  had  no  debt  in  2009,  the  2005  bankruptcy  petition
shows under Schedule F that, among several accounts listed, he owed two delinquent
accounts totaling about $570, a judgment of $5,171, and a medical account amounting
to $1,300. (GE 5 at 11, 23-26; Tr. 69-73)
SOR  1.a  –  This  mortgage  account  on  Applicant’s  house  in  location  B  became
delinquent  in  April  2018.  The  amount  of  the  delinquency  is  $2,847  on  a  balance  of
$192,159. He purchased the house in October 2014 and rented it in 2017 while he was
working  in  location  A.  The  mortgage  account  became  delinquent  because  Applicant
took a $20,000 pay cut when he moved from employment location A to B in July 2018.
(GE 6; Tr. 31-34, 46, 73, 86; July 2019 answer to SOR)
After Applicant moved to his house in location B, he discovered the renters had
caused extensive damage which he repaired. He had to fumigate the house. Because
water had been left standing on the kitchen floor, he had to repair the floor. He had to
repaint the house and fix the yard. He withdrew $1,000 from his retirement account for
the  repairs.  After  fixing  the  damage,  he  had  no  money  to  pay  the  mortgage  account.
Applicant  filed  a  Chapter  13  Bankruptcy  petition  in  April  2019  (SOR  1.m)  to  save  his
house in location B. The additional debts listed in the petition, which include most of the
SOR  accounts,  confirm  that  the  SOR  1.a  mortgage  was  not  Applicant’s  only  overdue
account  in  April  2019.  The  reason  why  Applicant  moved  was  to  relocate  his  disabled
mother from location C to his house in location B. His mother decided to move instead
with  one  of  Applicant’s  sisters.  (GE  6;  Tr.  31-35,  46,  73,  85-86;  July  2019  answer  to
SOR)
Regarding Applicant’s payments of the mortgage through the April 2019 Chapter
13 petition, he claimed he could provide documentation showing: (1) that he was current
on his $800 monthly payments under the Chapter 13 payment plan (SOR 1.a); and (2)
that  he  would  produce  documentation  from  2018  showing  the  four  missed  mortgage
payments. Applicant’s documentation does not show an $800 mortgage payment made
in  August  2019  and  thereafter,  or  any  previous  petition-plan  payments  of  $1,000  a
month before then. There are two postings, each identified as “bankruptcy payment,” for
August 2 and August 6, 2019, but no payment amount is entered next to either posting.
(Tr. 46-50, 75; July 2019 answer to the SOR; AE A, C, G)
The  lack  of  credible  documentation  of  payments  under  the  bankruptcy  petition
payment  plan  generates  questions  of  how  Applicant  reworked  his  budget  to  bring  the
mortgage  to  a  current  status.  In  the  email  exchanges  between  Applicant  and  his
bankruptcy  attorney  on  August  18,  2019,  the  attorney  noted  that  Applicant’s  plan
payment  was  behind  and  commented  that  fewer  less  costly  payment  options  were
available  regarding  payment  plans  for  the  mortgage.  SOR  1.a  was  removed  from  the
Chapter  13  petition  after  Applicant  received  a  home  loan  modification  (HLN)  on  the
mortgage. The HLM was signed, dated, and notarized by Applicant on August 1, 2019,
but contains no lender acknowledgement date by the mortgage company, or a signature
from a notary. (Tr. 46-50, 75; July 2019 answer to the SOR; AE A, C, G; AE H at 5-6)
SOR  1.b  –  This  is  an  installment  contract  for  a  car  that  became  delinquent  in
September 2018. The past-due amount is $577 on a balance of $28,199. The account
is  listed  in  Applicant’s  April  2019  Chapter  13  Bankruptcy  petition.  (GE  6  at  14;  Tr.  47,
49-50)
SOR 1.c – This is an installment contract for a car; the deficiency balance owed
is $8,976. Applicant and his partner cosigned for the car in 2016. The account became
delinquent  in  May  2018.  Eventually,  the  car  was  sold  at  auction,  leaving  a  deficiency
balance. Applicant returned the car to the dealer in April 2018 after his partner lost his
job in February 2018 and could not meet his portion of the monthly payments. (GE 3 at
2; Tr. 51-54)
Applicant  tried  to  place  the  SOR  1.c  deficiency  balance  in  the  April  2019
Bankruptcy  petition,  but  the  trustee  refused  because  of  joint  ownership  status  of  the
account. Applicant’s partner is now working as a chef and is making all payments on the
deficiency  balance.  Applicant  indicated  he  could  provide  documentation  to  show  his
partner is making payments on SOR 1.c. No documentation was submitted. (Tr. 51-54,
81-82)
SOR  1.d  –  This  is  an  unsecured  personal  loan  that  Applicant  opened  in
September 2017, with a former female coworker as cosigner. The account, which totals
$5,193,  became  delinquent  in  September  2018.  The  female  coworker  satisfied  the
account  in  November  2018.  Applicant  took  out  the  loan  to  pay  his  daughter’s  rent  to
avoid  her  eviction,  and  to  provide  her  with  funds  for  a  car  payment.  When  the  female
coworker  could  not  make  her  portion  of  the  monthly  payments,  Applicant  became
delinquent on the full payment by two months. (GE 3 at 2; Tr. 56-57, 83; AE D)
SOR 1.e – This is an account for cable equipment which is now in the April 2019
bankruptcy  (SOR  1.m).  The  account,  which  is  $1,603,  became  delinquent  in  August
2014.  Applicant  claimed  that  he  returned  the  equipment,  but  threw  away  the  shipping
receipt.  The  Government  credit  report  information  shows  that  Applicant  disputed  the
account. (GE 1 at 49; GE 2 at 4; Tr. 58-60)
SOR 1.f – This cable account that became delinquent in April 2017; the past-due
amount  is  $450.  Applicant  testified  that  the  balance  was  actually  $900,  and  when  he
visited  the  cable  company,  an  agent  settled  the  account  for  $450.  He  testified  that  he
paid  the  amount  in  June  2018,  but  the  cable  company  does  not  have  a  record  of  the
$450 payment. Applicant believes that his bankruptcy attorney just moved the account
into the Chapter 13 petition without investigating whether the account was valid. (GE 3
at 2; Tr. 60-63)
SOR 1.g – This is a medical account ($71) that became delinquent in April 2017.
Applicant’s documentation shows that he paid the account in May 2019, about a week
after he received the SOR. He was not aware of the account until the OPM investigator
informed him in the December 2017 PSI. When asked why he waited about a year and
a  half  to  pay  the  debt  in  May  2019,  he  explained  that  after  receiving  the  SOR  a  short
time earlier in May 2019, he decided to pay the debt. He predicted that he would have
eventually paid the debt because it was so small. (Tr. 62-65)
SOR 1.h – This phone account ($120) became delinquent in May 2014. Applicant
testified  that  he  closed  the  account  30  days  after  he  received  the  phone  because  he
was dissatisfied with the service. He told the OPM investigator in December 2017 that
he was overcharged for the phone, but planned to contact the collection agency and set
a payment plan. Documentation shows that Applicant disputed the account. The debt is
now in the April 2019 Chapter 13 petition. (GE 2 at 4; GE 4 at 3; Tr. 65-66)
SOR  1.i  –  This  is  a  cable  account  ($1,555)  that  became  delinquent  in  August
2017. Applicant agreed to assume primary liability for a cable account for his daughter.
She  finally  returned  the  cable  equipment  to  the  creditor.  In  December  2017,  Applicant
indicated  to  the  OPM  that  he  intended  to  contact  the  collection  agency  and  make
payments. Applicant testified that the account no longer appears on his credit report. He
agreed to furnish a copy of his credit report to show the account was no longer posted.
No credit report was submitted. (GE 2 at 5; GE 4 at 15; Tr. 66-67)
SOR 1.j – This is a payday loan ($920) that became delinquent in August 2017.
Applicant needed the funds to pay for his travel to and from his daughter’s high school
graduation in May 2014. Applicant chose the payday loan because he could not obtain
the funds in any other way. Though Applicant believed the interest rate of the loan was
160%,  he  could  not  remember  why  he  could  not  maintain  payments.  Surprisingly,  he
informed  the  OPM  investigator  in  December  2017  that  he  was  making  $50  monthly
payments  on  the  debt.  The  account  is  included  in  Applicant’s  April  2019  Chapter  13
petition. (GE 2 at 4; GE 4 at 15; Tr. 67-68, 83)
SOR  1.k  –  This  is  a  dental  account  for  Applicant’s  daughter.  The  bill  ($136)
became  delinquent  in  July  2013.  Even  though  he  discussed  the  debt  with  the  OPM
investigator in December 2017, he did not pay the debt until after he received the SOR
in May 2019, the same explanation he supplied for paying the SOR 1.g debt. (GE 4 at
16; Tr. 68-69; AE B)
Though he provided no documentation to support his claims, Applicant indicated
that  he  used  credit  counseling  companies  to  fix  his  credit  issues.  He  paid  them  every
month, but saw no results because he was still receiving calls and letters from creditors.
He  began  contacting  the  collection  agencies  directly,  but  the  creditors  always  wanted
more money than the parties had originally negotiated. (GE 1 at 46)
In  2017,  he  paid  a  credit  repair  firm  $100  a  month  for  up  to  six  months  to
discourage  collection  agencies  from  contacting  him.  He  noted  that  the  firm  had  been
making  some  early  progress  in  removing  some  accounts  from  his  credit  report.
However, he became dissatisfied again because he was still receiving phone calls and
letters from collection agents. He testified that he pulled out of the credit-repair service
after  paying  a  $100  a  month  for  six  months  and  seeing  no  improvement  in  his  overall
finances.  Applicant  has  never  received  financial  counseling  and  has  not  obtained
financial advice from anyone. (GE 1 at 46-47; GE 2 at 4; Tr. 74, 79-80)
Though  Applicant  has  had  uninterrupted  employment  for  the  last  ten  years,  he
has been able to save only $1,000, although he believes he could borrow some of the
$4,000 that his partner has saved. The reasons for the paltry savings is: that Applicant
has  had  to  occasionally  subsidize  his  daughter’s  college  living  and  transportation
expenses over the years; that he has paid most of his partner’s bills whenever he could
not pay them; and that he had to spend a large amount of money in July 2018 to fix the
damage to his house in location B. (Tr. 78-79, 87)
In  his  closing  statement,  Applicant  conceded  that  he  has  made  some  poor
financial choices, but takes responsibility for all his decisions. He indicated that he has
established  a budget  to keep track of  his  finances.  (AE F)  He  used the  word “budget”
several times in his July 2019 answer to the SOR and in his closing statement, but did
not explain whether he has a written budget or a computer-generated budget. AE E is
not a budget, but a list of creditors with undated payment amounts posted next to each
creditor. (AE E)
