and has  three  children.  He  enlisted  in  the  U.S.  Navy  in  2006,  and  he  received  a  top
secret security clearance in 2010. In 2014, Applicant received an honorable discharge

SOR  allegation  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  Applicant  falsified  information  on  his  October
2015 SCA when he answered “No” to the following question: “Section 25- Investigations
and  Clearance  Record  –  Denied  Clearance Have  you  EVER  had a  security  clearance
eligibility/access  authorization  denied,  suspended,  or  revoked?”  Applicant  had  his
Sensitive  Compartmented  Information  (SCI)  access  revoked  in  June  2015  by  a
U.S.  government  agency.  In  his  response  to  the  SOR  he  denied  intentionally
falsifying  this question,  as  he  thought  his  Visitor  Access  Request  (VAR)  was  denied
due  to  failing  a polygraph  on  three  separate  occasions.  Until  the  receipt  of  the SOR,
he  did  not  realize  that  his  SCI  access  was  revoked  by  a  Federal  government
agency.  At
the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  answered  this  question  “No”
because he thought the question pertained to security clearances only, and he never
had  a  security  clearance  denied, suspended, or revoked. It was his impression that he
was  walked  out  of  a  building  after  the  Federal  government  agency  no
longer
supported  his  VAR.  (Tr.  23-24;  SOR response)

SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that Applicant falsified information on his July 2010 SCA when
he  answered  “No”  to  the  following  question:  “Section  23  –  Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or
Drug  Activity
illegally  used  any  controlled
substance,  for  example,  cocaine,  crack  cocaine,  THC,  narcotics,  stimulants  …?”
Another  Federal  government  agency  reported  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  on
several  occasions  from  2003  to  2007,  he  sold  marijuana  from  2003  to  2005,  and  in
2003  he  sold  crack  cocaine.  In  his  SOR  response,  Applicant  admitted  that  he
intentionally  falsified  his  drug  history when  he  completed  the  2010  SCA,  but  he  also
claimed  that  the  illegal  drug  activity  occurred  during  his  teenage  years  only.  He
intentionally  falsified  the  SCA  after  he  was advised  by  unnamed  individual(s)  to  never
divulge  his  illegal  drug  use  due  to  potential negative  consequences  while  he  was  an
enlisted  member  in  the  U.S.  Navy.  Applicant  was  subsequently  granted  a  top  secret
DOD security clearance in 2010. (Tr. 25-29, 37)
At the hearing, Applicant denied ever using illegal drugs while he was  an active
member of the Navy. He admitted that he sold marijuana in high school, for a combined
total  amount  of  less  than  $1,000.  He  also  noted  that  some  of  the  details  he  provided
during his polygraph to another government agency was due to being under stress, and
trying  to  divulge  as  much  information  as  possible  to  pass  the  polygraph  test.  He
provided  “clarification”  to  the  timeframe  and  his  involvement  with  illegal  drugs,  in  an
effort to appease the polygrapher. (Tr. 25-29, 37)
During  questioning  by  Department  Counsel,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  stole
three 30-gallon bags full of marijuana from a farmer who employed him during his high
school  years.  He  and  a  couple  of  his  friends  sold  some  of  that  marijuana  for
approximately two or three thousand dollars. Applicant told the polygrapher that he used
illegal drugs  while  he was  an enlisted member of  the  U.S. military,  and  his last use  of
illegal drugs occurred in 2007. At the hearing, Applicant claimed that he was mistaken
about the dates. He only used and sold illegal drugs during the years he attended high
school, and he stopped all illegal drug activity upon his graduation from high school in
2004.  Applicant  testified  that  after  he  reported  to  the  polygrapher  that  he  last  used
marijuana  in  2007  while  a  member  of  the  U.S.  military,  he  was  able  to  pass  that
particular  portion  of  the  polygraph  exam.  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  admitted  he  made
those  statements  to  the  polygrapher,  but  claimed  they  were  inaccurate.  When
questioned  by  Department  Counsel  if  he  had  ever  traded  marijuana  for  prescription
medication, Applicant initially denied doing so, but then recanted and said he did trade
marijuana for prescription medications when he was about 14 years old. He also denied
selling  crack  cocaine  and  stated  he  would  have  traded  crack  cocaine  for  something
else,  but  then  admitted  he  had  received  money  for  crack  cocaine,  most  likely  $10  or
$20. (Tr. 29-33, 35-37; GE 3)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges that Applicant falsified information on his May 2005 SCA when
he  answered  “No”  to  the  following  questions:  “Section  27  –  Your  Use  of  Illegal  Drugs
and Drug Activity Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have
you  illegally  used  any  controlled  substance,  for  example,  marijuana,  cocaine,  crack
cocaine …?” and “Section 29 – Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity In the last 7
years,  have  you  been  involved  in  the  illegal  purchase,  manufacture,  trafficking,
production, transfer, shipping, receiving, or sale of any narcotic, depressant, stimulant,
hallucinogen, or cannabis for your intended profit or that of another?” Applicant admitted
he also intentionally falsified his 2005 SCA because he was worried that his past history
with illegal drugs would prevent him being accepted in the U.S. Navy. He testified that
his  intentional  falsification  of  the  2010  and  2005  SCAs  did  not  show  a  pattern  of
deception,  which  occurred  due  to  unique  circumstances,  bad  advice  from  others,  and
his immature age. (Tr. 37-41)
