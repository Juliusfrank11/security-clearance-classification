Applicant  is  53  years  old  and  divorced  with  three  adult  children.    She  has  a
bachelor’s degree in information technology.  She holds the positon of journeyman for a
defense  contractor.    She  seeks  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  her
employment in the defense industry.
The  SOR  alleges
that  Applicant  has  17  delinquent  accounts
totaling
approximately $66,150.  Her student loan debt totals approximately $53,000 of the total.
The remaining debt is miscellaneous consumer and medical debt.  Applicant also failed
to timely file her Federal income tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016.  She
was  indebted  to  the  state  for  back  taxes  owed  for  tax  years  2016  and  2017.    In  her
Answer,  Applicant  admits  each  of  the  allegations  and  provides  explanations.    Credit
reports of the Applicant dated November 3, 2014; June 21, 2017; August 2, 2018; and
August 28, 2019, reflect that each of these debts was at one point owing.  (Government
Exhibits 4, 5, 6 and 7.)
Applicant served on active duty in the United States Navy  for twenty years from
1984  until  2004,  when  she  was  honorably  discharged.    Her  military  record  shows  that
she  experienced  financial  difficulties  then.    She  applied  for  and  obtained  a  security
clearance while in the military in 1989.  In 1992, due to financial difficulties, her security
clearance was suspended for about a 90-day period, and was then reinstated.  (Tr. p.
41.)    After  she  retired,  she  became  a  full-time  college  student,  using  her  GI  bill,  and
worked two jobs.   She states that ever since she retired from the Navy, she has owed
taxes.  (Tr. p. 44.)
Applicant  admits  that  she  failed  to  file  her  Federal  income  tax  returns  on  time.
She  has  no  good  excuse  for not  filing  her  income  tax  returns  on  time  other than  poor
time management, and anticipating that she would owe taxes that she did not have the
money to pay.  Applicant has at times lived beyond her means.  Since her interview in
2018 concerning her security clearance, she has been diligent about paying her bills on
time  and  living  within  her  means.    She  now  follows  a  budget  and  keeps  a  monthly
budget book to keep close track of her bills.  Each month she records all of her bills and
where her money goes.  After paying all of her monthly expenses, she has about $500
left  in  discretionary  funds.    Applicant  has  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  for  about
twelve years.  A security clearance is necessary for her position.
Allegations  1.a.  through  1.j.,  concern  a  number  of  student  loans  Applicant
obtained in order to complete her college degree.  Applicant provided a copy of a letter
she received regarding her student loan consolidation application  to lower her monthly
payments  on  her student  loans.    (Applicant’s  Exhibit  B.)  In  June 2018,  she entered a
loan rehabilitation program and completed the program in February 2019.  On October
2019, due to financial hardship, Applicant filed a general forbearance request that was
approved.  (Applicant’s Exhibit E.)  Since 2008, Applicant has made payments, off and
on,  toward  her  student  loans,  and  has  been  in  forbearance  once  before.    Her  latest
agreement will allow her to pay $104 monthly for ten years to pay off her student loan of
$53,000.  (Tr. pp. 64-65.)
Allegation 1.k., is a debt owed to a department store that was charged off in the
amount of $573.  Applicant has settled the debt.  (Applicant’s Exhibit A, and Tr. p. 67.)
Allegation 1.l., is a debt owed to a creditor on an account that was charged off in
the  approximate  amount  of  $175.    Applicant  settled  this  debt  on  August  9,  2019.    (Tr.
pp. 67-68 and Applicant’s Exhibit D.)
Allegation  1.m.,  is  a  debt  owed  to  a  creditor  for  account  that  was  placed  for
collection in the approximate amount of $4,706.  Applicant proposed a settlement offer
of  $1,416.32  that  was  accepted  to  resolve  the  debt  for  less  than  originally  owed.
Payments  were  made  in  the  amount  of  $50  beginning  December  13,  2019,  and  then
every month thereafter until June 12, 2020, in the amount of $227.72 monthly at which
time the matter will be settled.  (Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit 5.)
Allegation 1.n., is a debt owed to a creditor that was placed for collection in the
approximate amount of  $870.   Applicant  settled this account  for $434.94 on  August  7,
2019.  (Applicant’s Exhibit H.)
Allegation 1.o., is a medical bill that was placed for collection in the approximate
amount of $782.  Applicant has settled this debt.  (Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit 4.)
Allegation 1.p., is a debt owed to a creditor for an account placed for collection in
the approximate amount of $600.  Applicant settled the debt for $389.90 on September
11, 2009.  (Applicant’s Exhibit I.)
Allegation 1.q., is a medical bill that was placed for collection in the approximate
amount of $69.  Applicant has settled this debt.  (Applicant’s Exhibit G.)
Allegation  1.r.,  concern  Applicant’s failure  to  file  her Federal income tax  returns
for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016, in a timely fashion.  Applicant has now filed these
returns,  paid  any  Federal  taxes  owed,  and  has  provided  copies  of  these  tax  returns.
(Applicant’s Exhibit J.)
Allegations  1s.  and  1.t.,  concern  Applicant’s  delinquent  back  taxes  owed  to  the
state for tax year 2017 in the amount of $520, and for tax year 2016 in the amount of
$528.  Applicant has since paid all of her state back taxes in full.  (Applicant’s Exhibit K.)
Although Applicant is not normally provided a performance evaluation, she asked
her  supervisor  for  one  and  was  provided  it.    Her  performance  evaluation  dated
December 17, 2019, reflects that she “meets” and “exceeds” the goals and objectives of
her job.   She  also excels at  resolving  issues  and  situations  with  little  support from  her
supervisor.  It is also recommended that she take some classes to improve her abilities
and skillset on emerging technology.  (Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit 3.)
A letter from the Applicant’s mother, who resides with the Applicant, and who the
Applicant  takes  care  of,  alludes  to  Applicant’s  hard  working  nature,  trustworthiness,
reliability and good judgment.  (Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit 6.)
Applicant  also  provided  a  receipt  for  payment  of  a  debt  that  was  not  alleged  in
the SOR to show good faith.  (Applicant’s Exhibit C.)
