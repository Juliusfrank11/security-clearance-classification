Applicant is a 54-year-old single man. He is a veteran of the U.S. Army, serving on
active duty from 1987 to 1990, and in the National Guard from 1990 to 1995. (GE 9; AE I)
While on active duty, he earned an associate’s degree. (Tr. 54) After leaving active duty,
having been discharged honorably, Applicant enrolled in college, completing a bachelor’s
degree  in  1996  and  a  master’s  degree  in  computer science  in  1999.  He  is a software
developer who has been subcontracting with various federal government contractors since
1996. (Tr. 55; GE 1 at 11) Throughout his career, Applicant has been in positions that have
required either a security clearance or public trust eligibility. (Tr. 61)
Applicant is highly respected among his professional peers. According to his current
project supervisor, he has a stellar work ethic, logging long hours to get the job done under
highly stressful situations. (AE H) A project manager for another contractor with whom he
works, characterizes him as an outstanding software developer who “continues to impress
the customer with the quality of his work, his integrity, and his can-do attitude.” (AE H at 3)
Applicant has been using marijuana intermittently since 1982. Although the majority
of his use occurred before 1997, some of his marijuana use since then occurred while he
possessed  a  security  clearance.  (Tr.  58)  According  to  Applicant,  he  has  only  used
marijuana twice since 2014.   (Tr. 57)
Since 1996, Applicant has completed three security clearance applications and one
application  for public trust  eligibility. Each application contained a  question concerning
illegal  drug  use  within  the  seven  years  preceding  the  completion  of  the  respective
application.  Applicant  answered  “no”  on  each  application.  (GE  1  –  3;  GE  5)  After
completing the 1996 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed his omission to an
agent before being confronted, explaining that he overlooked the section of the security
clearance application that required the application to be answered with complete honesty.
(GE  9  at  5)  Specifically,  he  told  the  agent  that  when  he  completed  an  application  for
acceptance into the Army in the late 80s, the recruiter told him not to admit past drug use
because  it  could  have  a  detrimental effect  on  his career. (GE 9 at 5) He followed this
advice when he completed the 1996 clearance application.
Between 2007 and 2014, Applicant submitted two security clearance applications
and  an  application  for  a  position  of  trust.  He  omitted  the  marijuana  use  from  each
application, explaining  that the legality of marijuana in several states since the completion
of  the  1996  security  clearance  application  rendered  the  question  of  “illegal”  use  of
marijuana ambiguous. (GE 8 at 2) Marijuana was not legal, nor has it ever been legal in the
state where Applicant used it. (Tr. 59-60)
Applicant continued to use marijuana over the years despite promising during the
course  of  each  previous  investigation  that  he  would  quit.  (Tr. 61-62)  In  January  2020,
Applicant executed an affidavit swearing to abstain from all drug involvement in the future.
(AE J)
As of July 2017, Applicant owed approximately $38,000 in unpaid federal income
taxes. (AE D) Applicant attributes his tax debt to financial problems that began in 2006,
when he overextended himself financially by purchasing a home using a non-traditional
mortgage loan product that he could not afford. (Tr. 15)  The house was underwater for all
11 years that he owned it. (Answer at 6) Furthermore, Applicant testified that his financial
problems stemming from the home were exacerbated in 2008 when the market crashed,
additionally decreasing the home’s value. (Tr. 15)
In 2013, Applicant experienced a brief period of unemployment, which coincided
with the acceleration of the mortgage payments. (GE 6 at 7) Consequently, by the end of
April 2013 Applicant had exhausted his savings, and he was unable to pay his federal
income taxes for 2012. (Tr. 16, 68)  By November 2013, the tax year 2012 income tax debt
had  grown  to  $18,875.  (GE  B)  That  month,  Applicant  began  making  $5,000  monthly
payments through an installment agreement that he negotiated with the IRS. (AE B) By
November 2014, he had satisfied the income tax debt for tax year 2012. (Tr. 70; AE C at
13) Although he had satisfied the 2012 tax delinquency, he had incurred a tax debt for tax
year 2013, which totaled $10,570. (AE C at 14) Per the installment agreement, Applicant’s
2013 income tax debt rolled over automatically to tax year 2014, and has continued to roll
over to successive years after each preceding year’s tax debt is satisfied. (AE C at 14)
Applicant  continues  to  make  payments  on  his  income  tax  debt  through  his
installment agreement. Once he satisfies the tax debt for one year, the IRS then applies
the payments to the successive tax year. (Tr. 71) Applicant’s tax debt spiked in 2017, the
year he short sold his home. (AE C at 14) Since then, he has been paying $1,000 monthly.
Currently, the balance of his tax debt is approximately $16,000. (Tr. 17)
Applicant earns $111,000 annually. (Tr. 73) He anticipates receiving a raise. He will
apply the additional funds to the tax debt.
Applicant is a successful gambler. (Tr. 76) He has mastered the laws of probability
governing table games, minimizing the “house advantage.” (Tr. 76) In 2008, Applicant won
$100,000 through casino gambling. (Tr. 75) In 2012, he won $15,000. (Tr. 76) When asked
on cross-examination about additional gambling winnings, Applicant acknowledged more
winnings, but could not specifically recall the corresponding years, explaining that at “times
[he]  win[s]  $10,000,  there’s  times  [he]  win[s]  $20,000,  [and]  there’s  times  [he]  win[s]
$100,000.” (Tr. 76)
SOR subparagraph 2.e alleges that Applicant falsified his response to Section 26 of
the June 2014 security clearance application when he failed to disclose the outstanding tax
debt from tax years 2012 and 2013. Applicant did not file his 2012  tax return on time.
However,  he  applied  for  an  extension,  negotiated  a  payment  plan,  and  had  begun
executing it in November 2013, six months before he completed the security clearance
application. (AE B)
