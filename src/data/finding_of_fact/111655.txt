Personal Conduct
In about April 2004, Applicant’s  spouse  obtained a domestic  violence  restraining
order  against  Applicant.  (SOR  response  to  ¶  3.b;  GE  7)  He  was  not  convicted  of  any
offense  as  a  result  of  the  April  2004  altercation  with  his  spouse.  (SOR  response  at  6)
Applicant  was  unable  to  remember  or  unwilling  to  disclose  details  of  the  April  2004
altercation with his spouse at his hearing. (Tr. 31, 54)
In June 2007, Applicant and his spouse had another physical altercation. She was
a petty officer first class, and Applicant and his spouse were living on base in government
housing overseas. (GE 6 at 9) They were in bed, and she was insulting him. (GE 6 at 9)
Applicant  described  the  physical  altercation  to  the  Naval  Criminal  Investigative  Service
(NCIS) as follows:
At some point, [she] started to try to push me out of the bed with her leg.
She was lying on her side as she was trying to push me out of the bed. She
was not able to get me out of the bed, but she kept on saying things to me
to hurt me, belittle me, and make me mad. [She] was lying face down on
her stomach, and I got on top of her to hold her down by lying on her with
my body. I was trying to stop her from continuing to say things to me so I
grabbed her with my hands by her face and head. I kept telling her to shut
up. [She] was struggling the whole time. I did not twist or turn [her] by her
head. I am sure she got the mark on her face when I was holding her by the
head, but I do not know how she got the other marks, shown [in the photos].
. . . I knew she was going to call security, so I unplugged the phone from
the wall. (GE 6 at 9-10)
Applicant  admitted  that  he  laid  on  top  of  his  spouse  and  grabbed  her  face  hard
enough to leave marks on her skin. (See SOR response to ¶ 3.a at 5 (admitting to mutual
physical  contacts  and  unhealthy  marital  conflicts)  The  NCIS  report  of  investigation
indicates  Applicant  and  his  spouse  engaged  in  a  physical  altercation,  and  they  both
sustained bruises. (GE 6) Applicant admitting pinning his spouse to the bed and grabbing
her by  the face and head. She  had  “bruises  and abrasions  to  her chest,  shoulder, and
face.”  (GE  6  at  2,  5) Applicant  had  “a  small  injury”  to  his  neck  and  thumb.  (AE  6  at  2)
Applicant’s commander ordered him to move out of base housing until further notice. (AE
6 at 5) Applicant told NCIS that there were two prior incidents involving the police, one
involving pushing in 2004, and one involving a verbal argument  (no physical contact) in
2006. (AE 6 at 5, 11) No adverse inference is drawn from the incident in 2006. He received
marital  counseling.  (SOR  response  at  5-6)  He  was  not  convicted  of  a  crime.  (SOR
response at 5; GE 6) Applicant was unable to remember or unwilling to disclose details of
the June 2007 altercation with his spouse at his hearing. (Tr. 30, 54)
On July 2, 2019, Applicant responded to the  domestic violence allegations in the
SOR. Applicant said, “[a]fter going to counseling and working together as a team, my wife
and I came out strong and closer than ever before. We have found healthy ways to handle
conflict, so I can say with utmost confidence that the behaviors from the past will not recur.”
(Tr. 54-56; SOR response at 6)
In August 2019, Applicant was upset with his spouse because he believed she was
having  an  extramarital  affair.  (Tr.  32-33)  Applicant  and  his  spouse  argued  for  several
hours.  (Unless  another  citation  is  indicated,  the  information  in  this  paragraph  is  from  a
police report, GE 5 at 4, 6-9) They engaged in mutual shoving. (Tr. 67) She took a photo
album into the kitchen and began burning photographs. (Tr. 67) His spouse said Applicant
pulled  her  hair,  pushed  her  into  the  sink,  grabbed  her  crotch,  and  made  negative
comments  about  her  crotch.  (Id.  at  4,  6)  Applicant  said  he  could  have  pulled  her  hair;
however, he did not remember pulling her hair. (Tr. 67-68) She responded by calling the
police. Applicant admitted the mutual pushing, and that he pushed her away from the stove
because she was trying to burn photos of his deceased father. (Id. at 4)
The police arrested Applicant for the August 2019 altercation, and Applicant was
charged with assault and battery. (Id. at 4, 9) Applicant told the magistrate “he pushed her
by  the  stove,  and  also  that  he  may  have  pulled  her  hair.”  (Id.  at  4)  The  disposition
information  relating  to  Applicant’s  assault  and  battery  charge  is  not  part  of  the  record.
Applicant  said  he  did  not  understand  whether  the  court  proceeding  included  a  plea  of
guilty. (Tr. 57, 64) On December 2, 2019, Applicant paid $450 to enable him to begin  a
court-ordered 18-week domestic violence course. (Tr. 33-34, 57-58; AE K) Applicant said
he started the course. (Tr. 34) Applicant said he will be on probation until October 2020.
(Tr. 58) He might be able to have the charges dismissed. (Tr. 66)
Financial Considerations
Applicant  is  currently  unemployed,  and  he  was  unemployed  from  July  2017,  to
January  2018,  and  from  June  2006,  to  August  2007.  (Tr.  28,  44-45;  GE  1;  GE  2  at  3)
Applicant said he was unable to pay some of his debts because of unemployment. (Tr. 35-
36) He has a 70 percent disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs. (Tr. 29)
The SOR alleges three delinquent debts totaling $34,013 as follows:
SOR  ¶  4.a  alleges  Applicant  has  a  charged-off  credit-card  debt  for  $20,140.
Applicant’s June 27, 2019 Equifax credit report indicates this debt was $5,879 past due,
and  was  reported  delinquent  in  May  2017.  (AE  D  at  21)  On  November  15,  2019,  the
creditor wrote the debt was settled for $12,175, and the debt is resolved. (Tr. 34, 64-65;
AE  J)  Applicant’s  January  6,  2020  TransUnion  credit  report  reflects  a  zero  balance,
“Account paid in Full; was a Charge-off,” and “SETTLED-LESS THAN FULL.” (AE R at 2)
SOR  ¶  4.b  alleges  Applicant  has  a  store  debt  placed  for  collection  for  $9,878.
Applicant’s June 27, 2019 Equifax credit report indicates the debt was in collections until
May 2019 when a $4,270 payment was due as a balloon payment. (AE D at 9-10) In June
2019,  the  creditor  sent  Applicant  a  bill  for  $4,270.  (AE  G)  Applicant’s  January  6,  2020
TransUnion credit report reflects a zero balance, “Account Paid in Full; was a Collection,”
and “SETTLED LESS THAN FULL.” (Tr. 34-35, 64-65; AE R at 3)
SOR ¶ 4.c alleges Applicant has a delinquent vehicle debt for $3,995. Applicant’s
June  27,  2019  Equifax  credit  report  indicates  the  debt  was  $3,769  past  due,  and  was
charged-off  in  the  amount  of  $16,026.  (AE  D  at  50)  The  debt  became  delinquent  in
September  2017.  (AE  D  at  50)  Applicant’s  January  6,  2020  TransUnion  credit  report
reflects a zero balance, “Account paid in Full; was a Charge-off,” and “SETTLED-LESS
THAN FULL.” (Tr. 35, 64-65; AE R at 6-7)
In addition to the SOR alleged debts, Applicant paid a charged-off credit-card debt
for $6,747 for less  than  the full  amount  in  April 2019.  (AE  D at  24-25) He  had multiple
accounts in “pays as agreed status,” including a mortgage for about $696,000. (AE D at
33-35) In July 2019, Applicant received financial counseling and generated a budget. (Tr.
36;  AE  E;  AE  S)  His  budget  indicated  his  net  monthly  income  is  $4,500;  his  monthly
expenses total $4,256; monthly debt payments are $525; and his monthly remainder is
$219.  (AE  E  at  3-4;  AE  S  at  3-4)  According  to  his  budget,  his  spouse  pays  part of  the
mortgage. (AE E at 3-4; AE S at 3-4) Applicant said he withdrew $50,000 from his Thrift

Nigeria
Nigeria  is  the  largest  economy  and  most  populous  country  in  Africa  with  an
estimated population of more than 190 million, which is expected to grow to 400 million
by 2050 and become the third most populous country in the world after China and India.
Nigeria had an estimated gross domestic product of 375 billion USD in 2018. Although
Nigeria’s economy has become more diversified, crude oil sales have continued to be the
main source of export earnings and government revenues. Despite persistent structural
weaknesses such as a deficient transportation infrastructure, the Nigerian economy grew
briskly for the decade ending in 2013. The growth rate slowed in 2014, owing in large part
to the fall in oil prices, and in 2016 and 2017 Nigeria experienced its first recession in over
two  decades  before  rebounding  in  2018.  The  gains  from  economic  growth  have  been
uneven; more than 60% of the population lives in poverty.
The United States is the largest foreign investor in Nigeria, with U.S. foreign direct
investment concentrated largely in the petroleum/mining and wholesale trade sectors. At
$2.2 billion in 2017, Nigeria is the second largest U.S. export destination in Sub-Saharan
Africa. The United States and Nigeria have a bilateral trade and investment framework
agreement. In 2017, the two-way trade in goods between the United States and Nigeria
totaled over $9 billion. . . .  Nigeria and the United States belong to a number of the same
international  organizations,  including  the  United  Nations,  International  Monetary  Fund,
World  Bank,  and  World  Trade  Organization.  Nigeria  also  is  an  observer  to  the
Organization of American States.
Nigeria  is  a  federal  republic  composed  of  36  states  and  the  Federal  Capital
Territory. In 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress party
was elected to a four-year term in the first successful democratic transfer of power from
a  sitting  president  in  the  country’s  history.  In  February  2019,  he  was  re-elected  for  a
second  term.  Notwithstanding  important  steps  forward  on  consolidating  democracy,
Nigeria continues to face the formidable challenges of terrorist attacks, inter-communal
conflicts, crime, kidnapping, and public mistrust of the government.
The U.S. Department of State travel advisory for Nigeria is Level 3: Reconsider
Travel due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and maritime crimes; and
Level 4: Do Not Travel to Borno and Yobe States and Northern Adamawa State due to
terrorism.  (emphasis  in  original)  The  U.S.  Embassy  has  limited  ability  to  provide
emergency  services  to  U.S.  citizens  beyond  Abuja  and  Lagos  and  their  immediate
surrounding areas. U.S. Government employees are subject to movement constraints as
security conditions warrant. Both Abuja and Lagos are assessed by the Department of
State as being high-threat locations for terrorist activity directed at or affecting official U.S.
Government interests. U.S. Government personnel are currently prohibited from traveling
to Borno due to terrorist threats against United States and European citizens located in
Borno.
Boko Haram, and ISIS-West Africa, both of which are designated Foreign Terrorist
Organizations,  are  active  in  Nigeria.  Boko  Haram  seeks  to  replace  the  Nigerian
government with an Islamic state, establish an Islamic caliphate across Africa, avenge
military offenses against the group, and destroy any political or social activity associated
with Western society. It conducts attacks primarily on civilian and regional military targets.
ISIS-West Africa also seek to implement its strict interpretation of Sharia and replace the
Nigerian government with an Islamic state.
Boko  Haram  and  ISIS-West  Africa  continued  to  conduct  attacks  against
government  and  security  forces  in  the  northeast,  which  resulted  in  deaths,  injuries,
abductions,  and  the  capture  and  destruction  of  property.  Boko  Haram  attacks  did  not
appear  to  discriminate  between  civilians  and  government  officials,  whereas  ISIS-West
Africa  tended  to  generally  focus  on  government  and  security  forces,  while  trying  to
cultivate  stronger  ties  with  local  communities,  including  by  providing  limited  social
services.  The  Nigerian  military  has  expanded  its  presence  in  parts  of  northeastern
Nigeria, but the northeast remains an active zone of combat, as Boko Haram and ISIS-
West Africa insurgents continue to carry out attacks.
While  Boko  Haram  no  longer  controls  as  much  territory  as  it  once  did,  the  two
insurgencies nevertheless maintain the ability to stage forces in rural areas and launch
attacks against civilian and military targets across the northeast. Boko Haram continued
to employ indiscriminate suicide bombings targeting the local civilian populations. ISIS-
West  Africa  targeted  civilians  with  attacks  and  kidnappings  less  frequently  than  Boko
Haram, but employed targeted acts of violence and intimidation against civilians in order
to expand its area of influence and gain control over critical economic resources. As part
of a violent and deliberate campaign, ISIS-West Africa also targeted government figures,
traditional leaders, and contractors. Both groups have carried out more than 600 to 700
attacks  in  Nigeria  using  small  arms,  captured  military  equipment,  suicide  bombers,
improvised  explosive  devices  (IEDs),  vehicle-borne  (VB)  IEDs,  ambushes,  and
kidnappings.
In  2018,  Boko  Haram  recruited  and  forcefully  conscripted  child  soldiers,  and  it
carried  out  scores  of  suicide  bombings,  many  by  young  women  and  girls  forced  into
service. The group conducted abductions and subjected many abducted women and girls
to sexual and gender-based violence, including forced marriage and rape. The Nigerian
government investigated attacks by Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa and took steps to
prosecute their members, although the majority of suspected insurgent group supporters
were held in military custody without charge.
Other human rights issues reported in Nigeria during 2018 included unlawful and
arbitrary killings, forced disappearances, and torture by both government and non-state
actors;  prolonged  arbitrary  detention  in  life-threatening  conditions,  particularly  in
government  detention facilities;  harsh and  life-threatening  civilian  detentions  in military
facilities,  often  based  on  flimsy  or  no  evidence;  and  infringement  on  citizens’  privacy
rights.  The  government  took  steps  to  investigate  alleged  abuses  but  fewer  steps  to
prosecute officials who committed violations. Impunity remained widespread at all levels
of government.
