Applicant is 52 years old. (Item 3 at page 5.) He is now divorced, with one step-
daughter. (Answer at pages 3 and 51~54.)
1.a. Applicant admits that he and his, then, estranged wife failed to file their state
and  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2005~2017,  thirteen  years.  Applicant
attributes his failure to file due to lack of cooperation from his estranged wife. He avers
that he was unaware that he could separate tax returns. This averment is not credible.
Although  he  has  now  filed  his  returns  for tax  years  2012~2017  (Answer  at  pages  5~9
and 14~50, and Response at pages 2~4), and realizing the tax authorities can at most
go  back  seven  years  seeking  income  tax  delinquencies;  this  does  not  preclude
Applicant from filing for tax years 2005~2011, or from offering evidence as to why he is
precluded from filing for those tax years. This allegation is found against Applicant.
1.b.  Applicant  admits  that  he  is  indebted  to  Creditor  B  for  $12,191.00,  as  the
result  of  the  repossession  of  an  automobile  that  he  co-signed  for  with  his  step-
daughter. In his Answer, Applicant avers, “I paid my car off in FEB 2017.” However, in
his  Response  Applicant  offers  evidence  showing  that  as  of  October  of  2019  that  the
“Remaining Balance due; [was] $10,049.01.” This allegation is found against Applicant,
as the debt is not resolved.
1.c.  Applicant  admits  that  he  is  indebted  to  Creditor  C  for  $2,499.00.  In  his
Answer,  Applicant  avers,  “I  am  paying  it  off  through  .  .  .  [a  fiscal  intermediary]  giving
them $50.00 per month.” This averment is supported by documentation from said fiscal
intermediary confirming the receipt of $250.00. (Response at page 5.) This allegation is
found for Applicant.
1.d. Applicant admits that he is indebted to Creditor D for $209.00. In his Answer,
Applicant  avers  simply  “I  don’t  know  who  to  pay.”  Although  the  Government  did  not
submit a credit report in support of this allegation, this did not preclude Applicant from
obtaining a credit report and addressing the admitted past-due debt from the information
contained therein. This allegation is found against Applicant.
1.e. Applicant admits that he is indebted to Creditor E for $405.00 for a past-due
medical debt. In his Answer, Applicant avers simply “I don’t know who to pay.” Although
the Government did not submit a credit report in support of this allegation, this did not
preclude Applicant from obtaining a credit report and addressing the admitted past-due
debt from the information contained therein. This allegation is found against Applicant.
1.f. Applicant admits that he is indebted to Creditor F for $166.00 for a past-due
medical debt. In his Answer, Applicant avers simply “I don’t know who to pay.” Although
the Government did not submit a credit report in support of this allegation, this did not
preclude Applicant from obtaining a credit report and addressing the admitted past-due
debt from the information contained therein. This allegation is found against Applicant.
