Applicant, age 41, has never married nor had children. She has cohabited with her
boyfriend since 2016. She earned a high school diploma in 1996, a bachelor’s degree in
2001, and a master’s degree in 2014. She has been employed as a finance director by a
defense contractor since July 2010. She maintained a DOD security clearance from about
2007 or 2008 until she was laid off by her previous employer in May 2010. (GE 3)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  “purchased  and  used  marijuana  with  varying
frequency from approximately January 1998 through at least April 2017.” (SOR ¶ 1.a). It
also alleged that her purchase and use continued to occur after she had been granted a
security clearance in approximately 2008. (SOR ¶ 1.b). Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 1.a,
but clarified that she has not purchased marijuana since 2001, only used marijuana twice
after 2003, and has not used marijuana since April 2017. She denied SOR ¶ 1.b on the
basis that she never used marijuana while having an active security clearance. (GE 2)
Applicant began experimenting with marijuana and other illegal drugs during high
school and college. She continued to use marijuana for several years after college. She
estimated  her frequency  of  use  as follows:  cocaine,  10  times  between  June  1995 and
July 2000; marijuana, 30 times between January 1998 and January 2003; and ecstasy,
two times between January 1999 and December 1999. She used them in social settings,
and  received  them  gratis  from  people  with  whom  she  was  socializing.  She  purchased
marijuana only on a “few” occasions, and never in mass quantities or for the purpose of
redistributing it. She stopped using marijuana in 2003 because she matured and decided
that it did not benefit her in anyway. After she stopped using marijuana, she intentionally
avoided situations where marijuana was present. She had no intent to use marijuana or
other illegal drugs in the future. (GE 5 at 35-36; GE 6)
Applicant used marijuana on two occasions after 2003, once while on vacation on
an  unspecified  date  in  2014  and  once  at  music  festival  in  April  2017  (for  reasons  not
explained in the record). While she was not in possession of an active security clearance
on either occasion, she was employed by a defense contractor. The record did not specify
whether she was subjected to any type of drug-use policy by her employer. She has not
used marijuana or other illegal drugs since April 2017. (FORM response; GE 2; GE 3 at
33-34)
Applicant first applied for a DOD security clearance in 2005. During that process,
she self-reported the history of her marijuana and other illegal drug use on her 2005 SCA
and  during  her  2007  security  clearance  interview.  She  was  granted  a  clearance  which
she maintained until she was laid off in 2010. That clearance did not transfer to her current
employer because she did not have a need for a security clearance. She now has a need
for a security clearance so her current employer is sponsoring the pending application,
which was initiated in October 2017. She self-reported the history of her marijuana use
within the last seven years on her 2017 SCA and candidly discussed it in her SOR answer
and FORM response. Her 2014 and 2017 marijuana use occurred prior to her submission
of the 2017 SCA. (FORM response; GE 2, 3, 5, 6)
In her subscribed and sworn SOR answer, Applicant reiterated her commitment to
remain abstinent from marijuana and other illegal drugs. She provided a signed statement
of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that
any  future  involvement  or  misuse  is  grounds  for  revocation  of  her  security  clearance
eligibility. She understands the seriousness of illegal drug use and that it is incompatible
with the maintenance of a security clearance. She has never used illegal drugs while in
possession of an active security clearance, and would never do so. She considers herself
a steward of the U.S. government and would never do anything to jeopardize proprietary,
sensitive, or classified information. (GE 2; FORM response)
