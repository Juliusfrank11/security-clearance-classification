received  a  high  school  certificate  in  2012,  but  he  does  not  have  a  general  education
diploma. Applicant has worked as a mortgage broker since May 2019. This is Applicant’s
first application for a DOD security clearance. He is seeking a security clearance to be a

20-23, 26-28, 57-58)
Criminal Conduct:
In March 2012, Applicant was arrested for domestic assault and battery after he
punched his stepmother twice in the face, breaking her nose. He was 14 at the time of
the  arrest,  and  as  a  result  he  spent  a  month  in  juvenile  detention.  After  this  incident,
Applicant’s father sent him to live in Iraq with Applicant’s aunt. (GE 2 at 7; GE 4; GE 3 at
3-4; GE 4; Tr. 59-61)
In  October  2013,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  domestic  assault  and  battery.  His
father called the police after Applicant broke his father’s car windows. Applicant’s father
told the police that Applicant was using marijuana. Applicant was put in a juvenile home
for  approximately  one  month  after  this  incident,  and  the  charges  were  ultimately
dismissed. (GE 3 at 5; GE 4; GE 5; Tr. 60-61, 68-69)
In  June  2014,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  failure  to  stop  after  a  personal  injury
accident, and failure to have insurance. Applicant struck a motorcycle and fled the scene.
Applicant and his friend were chasing an individual who took marijuana from Applicant’s
friend.  Applicant  pled  guilty  in  2015,  after  he  was  released  from  prison  for  the  crime
alleged in SOR allegation 2.d., and he received six months of probation. Despite his guilty
plea, Applicant claimed he allowed his friend to drive his vehicle, and he was a passenger
in his own vehicle. Applicant accepted responsibility for the accident because his friend
had a suspended license. (GE 1; GE 2 at 7; GE 3 at 7; GE 6; Tr. 69-77)
In August 2014, Applicant was charged with aggravated assault. Applicant was 17,
and his brother, who was 14, called the 18-year-old victim multiple times until the victim
met  Applicant,  his  brother,  and  two  of  their friends  in  a  parking  lot. Applicant’s  brother
threw the first punch, Applicant then punched the victim in the head, but claims he only
punched  him  once,  and  then  one  of  their  friends  punched  the  victim  once.  The  victim
suffered  a  broken  jaw,  a  broken  nose,  required  stitches,  and  reconstructive  surgery.
Applicant pled not guilty. He was tried as an adult, and a jury convicted him. Applicant
was sentenced to 365 days in jail. He was released two months early for good behavior.
(GE 1 at 27-28; GE 2 at 7; GE 3 at 4; GE 4; GE 7; Tr. 24, 77-88)
In  September  2014,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  driving  while  his  license  was
suspended, operation of a vehicle without registration plates, and no insurance. He was
sentenced to six months of probation. He had just purchased a vehicle from Craig’s List,
and  he  was  using  a  screwdriver  as  a  key.  At  that  time,  he  had  a  suspended  license;
therefore, he could not obtain registration plates. The incident occurred before he was
sentenced for the incident alleged in SOR allegation 2.d. (GE 8; Tr. 89-92)
In July 2015, Applicant was arrested due to outstanding warrants for driving while
his  license  was  suspended,  no  registration,  failure  to  stop  after  an  accident,  and  no
insurance. The outstanding warrants were related to the September 2014 incident alleged
in SOR allegation 2.c. Applicant failed to resolve these issues in SOR allegation 2.c due
to being incarcerated for ten months. Applicant pled guilty to three of the charges, and in
exchange the other three charges were dropped. He received six months of probation.
(GE 4; GE 9; Tr. 92-93)
In  May  2016,  Applicant  was  pulled  over  and  ticketed  for  no  insurance  and
registration  violation.  He  had  insurance  and  registration,  but  he  did  not  have  the
documentation  with  him  at  the  time  of  the  traffic  stop.  The  charges  were  eventually
dismissed. (GE 10; Tr. 93)
In May 2018, Applicant was ticketed for failure to display a valid license. He did
have a valid license, but not on him when he was pulled over by the police. The charge
was dismissed. (GE 11; Tr. 93-94)

subject  interview.  At  the  hearing,  he  admitted  to  lying  about  his  drug  involvement.
Applicant’s failure to self-report his marijuana use was not alleged in the SOR and will not
be considered disqualifying in the determination of his security clearance. (GE 1; GE 2 at
11; GE 3; Tr. 62-67)
Applicant testified that he has turned his life around in the past several years and
no longer associates with individuals who use drugs or are involved in criminal activity.

While working at the airport from 2016 to 2018, Applicant was promoted multiple
times.  He  left  this  job  in  July  2018,  because  he  obtained  his  real  estate  license  and
became a realtor. (Tr. 23-26)
Guideline B:
Applicant’s  father  was  born  in  Iraq.  In  1991,  he  fled  to  the  United  States  as  a
refugee and was subsequently naturalized. Applicant’s father owns property in Iraq, and
he  served  as  a  linguist  for  a  defense  contractor  from  approximately  2007  to  2009.

Applicant does not own property or have financial assets in Iraq. Applicant lives in
his  fiancé’s  home,  but  does  not  own  any  real  estate.  His  assets  total  approximately
$5,000. In his CSI, Applicant told the investigator that he had equal loyalties to the US
and Iraq. At the hearing, Applicant indicated that  he would not want to have to choose
between the two countries, but he would choose the US over Iraq. (GE 2; Tr. 30-32)
Applicant’s aunt is a citizen and resident of Iraq. She lives near the Kuwait border
and sells homemade pickles. She has never been associated with the Iraqi government.
Applicant  communicated  electronically  with  her  and  his  cousins  once  a  week  until
approximately two to three years ago. (GE 3 at 3; Tr. 36-37, 44, 46-48)
Applicant is solely a United States citizen; however, he lived in Iraq with his father
from January 2003 to January 2006. They lived with his father’s sister and her children.
Applicant’s father sent Applicant to Iraq to live with his aunt in January 2008, and he lived
with her for a year. After the arrest listed in SOR allegation 2.a, Applicant’s father sent
him to Iraq to live with his aunt from March 2012 until December 2012. (GE 2; Tr. 21, 33-
37, 39-43, 46)

any ties to the Iraqi government. (GE 1 at 24; GE 2; Tr. 34, 42-43, 53)
Applicant does not consider himself to be close to his aunt, despite living with her
for  three  significant  periods  during  his  childhood  and  maintaining  weekly  electronic
communications with her and her sons until approximately three years ago. (Tr. 48-49,
51-52)
Iraq
The U.S. Department of State warns that travel within Iraq remains very dangerous
and  the  ability  of  the  U.S.  Embassy  to  assist  U.S.  citizens  is  extremely  limited.  U.S.
citizens in Iraq are at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence. Numerous terrorist
and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such groups regularly attack Iraqi
security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten U.S. citizens
and western companies throughout Iraq. (HE I)
Severe  human  rights  problems  are  widespread  in  Iraq.  Sectarian  hostility,
widespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society
weakened the government’s authority and worsened effective human rights protections.
Problems include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities;
arbitrary arrests and lengthy pretrial detention; limits on freedom of expression to include
press,  social,  religious  and  political  restrictions  in  academic  and  cultural  matters;
discrimination  against  and  societal  abuse  of  women  and  ethnic,  religious,  and  racial
minorities; seizure of property without due process and limitations of worker rights. (HE I)
