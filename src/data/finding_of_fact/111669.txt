Applicant admitted all of the allegations in her response to the SOR (Answer). She
is 28 years old, single, and does not have any children. (Answer; GE 1; AE B)
Applicant graduated from high school in 2010. She obtained a bachelor’s and a
master’s degree in chemical engineering in 2015 and 2019, respectively. She worked as
a college intern for a DOD contractor during the summers of 2013 and 2014. She obtained
full-time  employment  as  an  engineer for  the  same  DOD  contractor  in  June  2015.  She
initially worked in one division until January 2017, then transferred to the division in which
she worked as of the date of the hearing. She was granted a DOD security clearance in
2013. (Tr. at 6, 15-16, 19-20, 24, 27, 29-30, 32-33, 54-55; GE 1, 4; AE C, D)
Applicant used marijuana from approximately January 2008 to June 2015 (SOR ¶
1.a).  She  first  used  marijuana,  on  one  occasion,  in  high  school.  The  majority  of  her
marijuana  use  occurred  in  college,  with  her  then  long-term  college  boyfriend.  She
acknowledged there were a few occasions when she used marijuana on her own, to relax
while studying or going to sleep. She estimated that she used marijuana “once or twice a
month with long periods where I actually just didn’t do it.” The individuals with whom she
used  marijuana  provided  it,  but  there  were  occasions  in  which  she  contributed  money
towards its purchase. (Tr. at 18-26, 28-31, 33-39, 46-47, 50-52; GE 1-4; AE C, D)
Applicant stopped using marijuana by the time she completed her June 2013 SCA,
which  was  during  “finals week” of  her third  year in  college.  She did  not  use marijuana
during  the  duration  of  her  summer  internships  in  2013  and  2014.  She  resumed  using
marijuana when she returned to college after completing both internships, and she also
used  marijuana  once  or  twice  after  her  March  2015  graduation.  She  held  a  clearance
during this period, having been granted one in 2013 (SOR ¶1.d). She testified that she
regretted doing so, but she was not thinking long-term. She has not used marijuana since
she began working full time in June 2015. (Tr. at 18-26, 28-31, 33-40, 46-47, 50-56; GE
1- 4; AE C, D)
Applicant used ecstasy and cocaine from approximately April 2011 to  July 2016
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c). She first used ecstasy during her first year in college, while at a concert
with her college roommate. All of her ecstasy use occurred while attending concerts. She
also first used cocaine during her first year in college, while at a fraternity party with her
college  roommate.  She  used  cocaine  occasionally  throughout  college,  while  attending
concerts with friends. The individuals with whom she used ecstasy and cocaine provided
them, and there were occasions in which she contributed money towards their purchase.
She  used  both  ecstasy  and  cocaine  twice  after  graduation;  she  last  used  ecstasy  in
January 2016; and she last used cocaine in July 2016. She held a clearance during this
period (SOR ¶1.d). She decided in 2016 that she never wanted to use ecstasy or cocaine
again. (Tr. at 18-26, 28-31, 33-40, 46-47, 50-56; GE 1-4; AE C, D)
Applicant reiterated that she regretted using marijuana, ecstasy, and cocaine after
her college graduation. She testified that though she was working full time,  she did not
contemplate the long-term implications of using drugs while working for her employer and
holding  a  security  clearance.  She  first  came  to  understand  such  implications  in  2017,
when she transferred to the division in which she worked as of the date of the hearing
and underwent the security clearance process again for continued access to classified
information, as further discussed below. (Tr. at 18-26, 28-31, 33-40, 46-47, 50-56; GE 1-
4; AE C)
Applicant misused the prescription medication Adderall, not prescribed to her, after
she  purchased  it  from  friends  between  April  and  October  2011;  and  she  misused  her
prescribed  Adderall  when  she  gifted  or  sold  it  to friends  between December 2011 and
June 2013 (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f). She first used Adderall in April 2011, prior to receiving  a
prescription for it. She was struggling in school and a friend who was prescribed it offered
it to her as a study aid. She found that it helped her study so she used it several more
times. She also purchased it for her personal use two to three times between the spring
and fall of 2011. (Tr. at 18-26, 28-31, 33-40, 57-58; GE 1-4; AE C)
In  the  fall  of  2011,  Applicant  sought  counseling  to  explore  the  possibility  of
receiving her own Adderall prescription; she received such a prescription when she was
diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. She used her prescribed Adderall
throughout college. She also gifted and sold some of her Adderall pills to several friends
during the week of college exams. She stated in her 2017 security clearance application
(SCA)  and  during  her  2018  background  interview  that  she  had  no  intent  to  sell  her
prescription  Adderall  again  in  the  future.  She  briefly  stopped  usage  of  her  prescribed
Adderall after graduation, and she resumed usage from 2016 to June 2019 while pursuing
her master’s degree. Though it helped with her learning disability, she testified that she
had no intention of taking it again because she did not want to have to take a drug “for
the rest of my life.” (Tr. at 18-26, 28-31, 33-40, 57-58; GE 1-4; AE C, D)
Applicant  was  aware  of  her  employer’s  policy  against  illegal  drug  use.  She
successfully completed drug tests in conjunction with her internships in the summers of
2013 and 2014, her full-time employment in 2015, and her 2017 transfer to the division in
which she worked as of the date of the hearing. She was subject to random drug testing,
but she had not been drug tested since 2016. In June 2019, she signed a statement of
intent not to illegally use any drugs in the future and that any violation constituted grounds
for revocation of her clearance. In April 2019, she was assessed by a psychiatrist and
determined to not be drug dependent. (Tr. at 18-33, 38-46, 50-55, 57, 59; AE C, D, E)
Applicant  testified  that  she  has  matured  and  her  priorities  have  changed.  She
testified that she socializes primarily with her coworkers “because of our similar values.”
She no longer associated with the individuals with whom she had previously used drugs,
to include her college roommate as well as  her then long-term boyfriend. She testified
that she terminated her relationship with her boyfriend in April 2019 because he continued
to behave like an “adolescent teenager and I wanted to be an adult, and he wasn’t getting
there with me.” Since 2016, she has been in several situations where drugs were being
used, and she chose to leave and go home. She was remorseful about her past drug use.
She  testified  that  she  understood  the  severity  of  her  actions,  she  had  no  intention  of
repeating the mistakes of her adolescence, and she did not intend to jeopardize her job
by using illegal drugs or misusing legal drugs. (Tr. at 18-33, 38-46, 50-57, 59-60; AE C,
D, E)
Applicant  first  completed  an  SCA  in  June  2013.  She  marked  “No”  and  failed  to
disclose information regarding her drug use, as discussed above in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.f, in
response to section 23. Section 23 inquired whether she had, in the past seven years: (1)
illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled  substances,  or  (2)  intentionally  engaged  in  the
misuse of prescription drugs, regardless of whether or not the drugs were prescribed to
her or someone else (SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 2.b). Applicant testified that when she completed her
2013 SCA during “finals week” of her third year in college, she was “really stressed out.”
She had not yet begun her summer internship. She testified that the SCA was included
with her onboarding paperwork, and she did not truly understand the nature of the SCA
or  the  security  clearance  process.  She  testified  that  she  confused  the  SCA  with  her
onboarding paperwork, stating:
I  didn’t  really  honestly  know  the  difference  between  my  onboarding
paperwork and the [SCA]. It kind of seemed like all one bundle of things that
I had to do just to get an internship. So, I did receive [the SCA] at that time
back in June or late May of 2013. But I can’t really say that I recognized [the
onboarding paperwork and the SCA] were two separate entities.
(Tr. at 26-28, 31-33, 35, 37, 47-50, 55-56, 61; GE 2; AE C).
Applicant could not recall meeting with a facility security officer (FSO), but rather
worked  on  the  SCA  through  an  individual  from  human  resources  (HR)  “who,  frankly,
rushed  me  through  the  process.”  She  recalled  this  individual  warning  her  that  her
internship would be jeopardized if she did not promptly complete the SCA. She testified
that she thought that she would not get the internship if she answered “Yes” to the relevant
drug questions, and she did not understand that her ability to obtain a security clearance
would be impacted. She testified that she lacked the resources to better understand that
she  would  not  be  punished  if  she  told  the  truth.  She  also  sought  the  guidance  of  her
father, an attorney, and followed his advice to mark “No” in response to section 23. She
ultimately chose to not jeopardize her internship. (Tr. at 26-28, 31-33, 35, 37, 47-50, 55-
56, 61; GE 2; AE C, D)
Applicant self-reported information about her past drug use to her FSO in January
2017,  when  she  transferred  to  the  division  in  which  she  worked  as  of  the  date  of  the
hearing. In turn, her FSO completed an incident history report, as required, on the Joint
Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) database. Applicant also disclosed her past drug
use information on her March 2017 SCA. She also disclosed her past drug use to her
managers and coworkers. She testified that she made a mistake in not disclosing such
information on her 2013 SCA, and she was “trying to own up to it and trying to correct it.”
She acknowledged that fear kept her from disclosing her drug use sooner. As previously
discussed, she reiterated that when she underwent the security clearance process again
in  2017  for  continued  access  to  classified  information,  she  truly  understood  the
implications of her past drug use and her failure to disclose such drug use on her 2013
SCA. It was then, that she “knew exactly what it was that . . . was a potential for somebody
to blackmail me . . . .” She was remorseful about her failure to disclose her drug use on
her 2013 SCA. (Tr. at 16-18, 21, 55-56, 59; GE 1, 4; AE C).
Applicant  testified  that  she  loves  her  job  and  “really  just  dove  in  into  my  career
since college.” Her employer rated her performance as “exceeded” expectations in 2015
and “significantly exceeded” expectations from 2016 to 2018. She is involved with various
professional societies devoted to promoting careers in science, technology, engineering,
and math among young adults. She also enjoys spending time outdoors, exercising, and
cooking.  Numerous  character  references,  to  include  her  manager  from  2018  to  2019,
coworkers, and friends, describe her as a responsible, honest, and trustworthy individual.
