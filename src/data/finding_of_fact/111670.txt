The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of March 8, 2019, Applicant was past
due $30,698 on a mortgage loan with a $158,242 balance (SOR ¶ 1.a), and that he owed
three charged-off credit-card debts totaling $4,460 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.d); two collection debts
of $742 (SOR ¶ 1.e) and $484 (SOR ¶ 1.f); a defaulted student-loan debt of $472 (SOR ¶
1.g); and four medical debts totaling $790 (SOR ¶¶ 1.h-1.k). When Applicant answered the
SOR, he admitted the allegations without explanation. His admissions are accepted and
incorporated  as  findings  of  fact.  After considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  hearing
transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is 32 years old and divorced. He and his ex-wife married in July 2012 and
were divorced in December 2016. They have a seven-year-old son. Applicant adopted her
two sons, who are now ages 10 and 11. (GE 1: Tr. 32.) Applicant has been working as a
field service technician for his current employer, a defense contractor, since August 2017.
(GE  1;  Tr.  19-20.)  He  previously  worked  as  a  marine  electrician  for  another  defense
contractor from March 2013 to August 2017. (GE 1.) He does not currently hold a DOD
security clearance. (Tr. 20.)
Applicant attended an out-of-state university for one semester, from September
2008 to December 2008. (GE 1.) He obtained two federal student loans for $1,750 (SOR ¶
1.g) and $1,000 (not alleged in SOR), in September 2008. His loans were current through
May 2017, when he ceased paying them. (GE 3; Tr. 31.) He transferred to an in-state
university  near  his  home  in  January  2009,  but  did  not  finish  the  semester.  He  began
studies  at  a  marine  academy  in  March  2013  and  earned  his  associate’s  degree  in
December 2016. (GE 1.) He did not obtain any student loans for that schooling because it
was a company-paid apprenticeship. (Tr. 36.)
Applicant worked as an assistant manager at a convenience store earning $10 an
hour from August 2010 to November 2012. (GE 1; Tr. 41.) After the birth of his son in
September 2012, he was unable to work the hours needed to maintain his employment. He
then worked as a part-time cook until January 2012, when he took off a few months to
spend time with his family. (GE 1.)
Applicant has lived at his address residence since September 2011. In February
2016, he purchased the property, a three-unit apartment building, for $140,000 from his
then wife’s parents. (GE 3; Tr. 23, 38.) He obtained a mortgage loan of $137,362. In April
2016, his loan was acquired by the lender in SOR ¶ 1.a. His monthly repayment term was
$1,220 per month. When he purchased the property, two of the units were occupied, and
the renters stayed on, paying him rent of $600 monthly per unit. (Tr. 38, 51.) His ex-wife
handled most of the bills during their marriage. She made the mortgage payments through
July 2016, but then stopped paying, initially without his knowledge. (GE 1; Tr. 43, 51-52.)
As of September 2017, his loan was $12,688 past due on a balance of $144,468. (GE 3.)
Applicant and his ex-wife relied on consumer credit for purchases, even before they
married. During their marriage, his ex-wife incurred some credit-card debt in his name
without his knowledge. (GEs 1-4; Tr. 29, 33.) Applicant admits that he lost control of the
household budgeting. (Tr. 18.) Their debts began to accumulate in 2013, following the birth
of their son in September 2012, and a period of voluntary unemployment from January
2013 to March 2013, before he started working in the defense industry at $24 an hour
($45,000 to $50,000 annually) in March 2013. (GE 1; Tr. 32, 42-43.) He became “a little
overwhelmed” with going from being single to having a wife and three children to support.
(Tr. 33.) His ex-wife also incurred expenses taking their children on vacations outside their
state. Applicant believes that his ex-wife’s depression contributed to some of their financial
problems. (Tr. 39-40.)
Applicant is being sponsored by his employer for a security clearance so that he can
travel and work on jobs that require a clearance. (Tr. 20.) On October 16, 2017, Applicant
completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions
(SF  86).  He  responded  affirmatively  to  SF  86  financial  record  inquiries  concerning
delinquency involving routine accounts and indicated that he owed approximately $5,000 in
credit card debt because his “ex-wife maxed out multiple credit cards.” He also reported
that his mortgage was approximately $15,000 past due, and explained that he had been
unaware that his ex-wife was not making the mortgage payments. As for efforts to resolve
his debts, his mortgage lender was reviewing paperwork “to come to a solution” for that
debt. He expressed his intent to consolidate his credit-card debts after his mortgage is
back on track. (GE 1.)
As of October 26, 2017, Applicant’s credit report revealed that his mortgage was
past due for $12,688 with a $144,468 balance (SOR ¶ 1.a), and that his two student loans
obtained in September 2008 were past due for $167 with a $441 balance (SOR ¶ 1.g) and
$133 with a $350 balance (not alleged).  (GE 3.) Applicant owed delinquent credit-card
balances of $2,108 (account opened in March 2016 and charged off in February 2017)
(SOR ¶ 1.b); $1,523 (account opened in October 2015 and in collection with last payment
in July 2016) (SOR ¶ 1.c); $829 (account opened in July 2016 and charged off in March
2017) (SOR ¶ 1.d); and $483 (account opened in June 2016 and in collection with last
payment in March 2017) (SOR ¶ 1.f). Medical debts of $348 from March 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.h);
$208 from August 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.i); and $50 from September 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.k) were in
collection. (GE 3.)
On October 3, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  about  his  finances.  Applicant  described  his
financial  situation  as  “screwed” due  to  his inability to responsibly manage his financial
responsibilities. He related that his mortgage loan was more than $20,000 past due and in
“pre-foreclosure status.” He had asked that some payments be deferred, but his lender
was demanding payment in full of the past-due amount. He explained that his financial
issues arose before his divorce, when he discovered that his then wife had not been paying
their bills. Additionally, she had obtained and used credit cards without his knowledge and
consequently, they became financially overextended. Applicant indicated that he took full
responsibility for repaying their marital debt on their divorce to avoid any child custody
issues and that he is required to pay $1,040 per month in child support.
Applicant volunteered that he had some rental income from one unit in his property.
He was living in one unit and his ex-wife and their children was living in the other unit,
without having to pay any rent or utilities. When asked specifically about other debt issues,
Applicant responded that there were so many that it was difficult to know who was owed
what.  When  confronted  with  the  adverse  financial  information  on  his  credit  record,
Applicant  explained  that  the  three  medical  debts  in  collection  were  for  his  children’s
healthcare. He did not dispute the student loans, which he mistakenly indicated had been
incurred  for  his  study  at  the  maritime  academy,  and  acknowledged  that  he  had  not
attempted to repay them, although he planned to at some time in the future.  Applicant did
not  recognize  several  credit  card  accounts  that  had  been  settled  or  paid  after  being
charged off or placed for collection, although when asked about those settlements during
his March 2020 hearing, Applicant responded that he and his ex-wife settled them together.
(Tr. 59.) Applicant  did  not  recognize  the  charged-off  credit  cards  for $2,108  and  $829
during his OPM interview. Applicant reiterated that he had become overwhelmed about his
current financial difficulties and can only resolve one debt at a time. He planned to pay his
debts at some future date, but had not contacted his creditors or attempted repayment
plans.
Sometime between the fall of 2018 and spring 2019, Applicant’s wife and children
moved in with him because he rented out their apartment unit. (Tr. 50.) Despite rental
income  of  $1,200  per month  from  the  two  apartments,  Applicant’s  mortgage  loan was
$30,698 past due on a balance of $158,242 as of February 2019. (GE 4; Tr. 24.) As to why
he fell so far behind on his loan, given that his rental income almost covered his monthly
mortgage obligation, Applicant responded:
Well,  like  I  was  saying,  the  mortgage  got  so  far  behind.  And  one  of  the
stipulations with the FHA loan was that you have to pay half the past-due
amount. So once we got about $15,000 past due, that would mean I would
have to pay $7,500 a month and then pay the other half the next month. (Tr.
51.)
By February 2019, Applicant had also made no progress on resolving the delinquent
credit-card balances or the student loan in SOR ¶ 1.g. He asserts that he paid off one of
his student loans (Tr. 32), and the $1,000 student loan (not alleged in the SOR) was not
listed as a delinquent debt on his February 2019 credit report. (GE 4.) His credit report
included two previously unreported delinquencies: a $742 consumer-credit debt from July
2016 in collection since June 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.e) and $184 medical debt from May 2018 in
collection since October 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.j). Applicant had no new consumer-credit accounts
on his credit record. (GE 4.)
In December 2019, Applicant had a mediation session with his lender about his
delinquent mortgage loan. His lender decided to proceed with the foreclosure action on his
mortgage.  As  of  March  2020,  Applicant  was  awaiting  a  trial  date.  Applicant  stopped
charging his tenants rent in October or November 2019 when it became clear that he would
not be able to resolve his delinquent mortgage. (Tr. 22-25, 40-41, 51.) He did not think it
was right to charge rent when he was not making any payments on the mortgage loan. He
has yet to inform his tenants that his loan is in foreclosure proceedings, although they know
he was having issues with his mortgage. (Tr. 26.) Applicant has been led to understand
that the foreclosure will likely happen. He believes that his mortgage lender will then likely
list the property for sale, and he will be liable for any deficiency balance on his loan. (Tr.
27.)
In lieu of paying child support, Applicant allows his ex-wife access to his checking
account. (Tr. 47.) She continues to handle their household bills. (Tr. 54.)   She has not
worked outside of the home since they married in 2012 and is financially dependent on
him. (Tr. 28, 43.)  He understands that he is legally responsible for repaying the credit-card
debt  incurred  by  his  ex-spouse  on  his  credit  cards.  He  continues  to  receive  collection
notices for some of his debts. As of March 2020, Applicant had not reached out to resolve
the student loan, credit card, or medical delinquencies listed in the SOR. (Tr. 29-30, 33.)
He explained his failure to be more proactive about resolving the issues of known concern
to the DOD as follows:
Honestly, I want to maintain a relationship with my children. I love my kids
very  much.  And  I  get  worried  that  [his ex-wife]  will go  elsewhere  where  I
would not be able to see my children. (Tr. 55.)
Applicant testified that his ex-wife has threatened to move his children out of state
and that it has been his goal to try and put his ex-wife in a situation where she can be
responsible for herself and he can maintain a good relationship with his children. In that
regard, he recommended to his ex-wife that she pursue counseling. She went only for a
short time, but she has been taking prescription medication for her depression for the past
two or three months. (Tr. 55-56.)
Applicant is a salaried employee earning about $65,000 annually with overtime. (Tr.
42.) His take-home pay ranges from $2,000 to $3,000 every two weeks. His pay fluctuates
because of overtime and travel. Applicant owns two vehicles, a van and a sedan, both
purchased  used,  that  are  paid  for.  Most  of  his income  goes  to  expenses  for his three
children, food, and utilities (heating oil, electricity, and Internet). He pays about $800 a
month for utilities. (Tr. 35-36.) He has between $1,000 and $2,000 in his checking account,
but nothing in savings (Tr. 36), and lives paycheck to paycheck. (Tr. 59.) Applicant received
a tax refund of $3,000 to $4,000 for tax year 2019. He used the money to pay off a couple
of loans that he and his ex-wife had taken out between them. (Tr. 37.)
Applicant’s  financial  difficulties  have  been  exacerbated  in  part  by  his  ex-wife
continuing to take frequent vacation trips. Sometime in 2019, she took their children to Italy
“on a whim.” (Tr. 44.) She has also signed his name without his knowledge on some credit-
card  charges.  (Tr.  45.)  Applicant  tried  to  cut  off  her  access  to  his  money,  but  he  was
focused on his children’s well-being, and did not think she could care of their children or
herself. (Tr. 46.) He has had several discussions with his ex-wife, including as recently as
within a week of his March 2020 hearing, about her handling of their finances and of the
importance to them of his clearance so that he can continue to support their children. She
continues to respond that she will take care of it and things will get better. (Tr. 64.) There is
no evidence that Applicant has had any financial counseling.
Applicant testified that he is a very hard-worker and considers himself trustworthy.
(Tr. 62.) He requested that his track record of working for defense contractors since March
2013  be  taken  into  account.  (Tr.  62.)  He  presented  no  character  or  work  references
attesting to the quality of his work.
