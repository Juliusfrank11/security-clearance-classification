From July 2011 to April 2013, Applicant served as a linguist in Afghanistan. (Tr. 7,

combat.  (Tr.  31-32)  For  example,  around  2012,  an  improvised  explosive  device  (IED)
exploded near his Stryker vehicle, and he and other vehicle occupants were tossed around

Afghanistan as a linguist supporting the United States. (Tr. 7, 40, 43-44) Two days before
his February 5, 2020 hearing, he returned to the United States, and he planned to return
to Afghanistan the day after his hearing. (Tr. 42) There is no evidence of criminal offenses,
use of illegal drugs, delinquent debts, or security violations. (GE 1)

with  about  $500  on  deposit.  The  value  of  his  land  in  Pakistan  has  varied  from  about
$40,000 to about $100,000 depending on a variety of economic factors. (Tr. 70-71) One
bank account currently has about $4,500 on deposit, and amount changes because his
retired pay is deposited in the account by the Pakistan government. (Tr. 64, 115-116) He

transfer excess funds to his United States accounts. (HE 3 at 7, 8, 14) Applicant inherited

(Tr. 57-60) Several visits were to support one of his siblings and his mother because of
their  medical  issues.  (Tr.  57-60)  He  is  nervous  about  visiting  Pakistan  because  of
sensitivities in that country in the areas of religion and politics. (Tr. 27) Freedom of speech
in Pakistan is limited and making comments about religion and politics or support of the
United States is risky. (Tr. 27) He avoids attending public gatherings in Pakistan. (Tr. 111)
Applicant did not renounce his Pakistan citizenship because Pakistan does not recognize
renunciation of citizenship for persons born in Pakistan. (Tr. 28) He retains his Pakistan

a delay in his travel. (Tr. 29) He occasionally sends money to friends and family living in
Pakistan. (Tr. 106-109)

110) He is adamant that he would resist any attempt at coercion and unlawful influence.
(HE 3 at 10) He is happy about his life in the United States, and he does not intend to
leave the United States and return to settle in Pakistan. (Tr. 117-118; HE 3 at 16)
The Islamic Republic of Pakistan (Pakistan)
The separation in 1947 of British India into the Muslim state of Pakistan (with West
and East sections) and largely Hindu India was never satisfactorily resolved; India and
Pakistan fought two wars and a limited conflict (in 1947-48, 1965, and 1999 respectively)
over the disputed Kashmir territory. A third war between these countries in 1971 - in which
India  assisted  an  indigenous  movement  reacting  to  the  marginalization  of  Bengalis  in
Pakistani politics - resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh.
The Department of State travel advisory for Pakistan is Level 3: Reconsider Travel
to  Pakistan  due  to  terrorism.  Four  areas  of  the  country  (Balochistan  Province,  KPK
Province, Azad Kashmir, and the India Pakistan Border) are at Level 4: Do Not Travel.
Pakistan is a federal parliamentary republic. In July 2018 the Pakistan Tehreek-e-
Insaf (PTI) party won the most National Assembly seats in the general elections, and in
August 2018, PTI’s Imran Khan became prime minister.
Since 2001, U.S. policy has broadly been to assist the creation of a more stable,
democratic, and prosperous Pakistan that actively combats religious militancy. A key U.S.
ally  in  combatting  terrorism  after  9/11,  Pakistan  had  been  a  leading  recipient  of  U.S.
assistance, receiving more than $30 billion in aid and military reimbursements since 2001.
In January 2019, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence told a Senate panel of
“Pakistan’s  recalcitrance  in  dealing  with  militant  groups,”  and  predicted  Pakistan  will
continue  to  threaten  U.S.  interests  “by  deploying  new  nuclear  weapons  capabilities,
maintaining  its  ties  to  militants,  restricting  counterterrorism  cooperation,  and  drawing
closer to China.” Pakistan is a haven for numerous Islamist extremist and terrorist groups,
and successive Pakistani governments are widely believed to have tolerated and even
supported some of these as proxies in Islamabad’s historical conflicts with its neighbors.
Although  the  Pakistani  government  voiced  support  for  political  reconciliation
between the Afghan government and the Afghan Taliban, it did not restrict the Afghan
Taliban and the Haqqani Network (HQN) from operating in Pakistan-based safe havens
and  threatening  U.S.  and  Afghan  forces  in  Afghanistan.  The  government  failed  to
significantly  limit  Lashkar  e-Tayyiba  (LeT)  and  Jaish-e-Mohammad  (JeM)  from  raising
money, recruiting, and training in Pakistan - and allowed candidates overtly affiliated with
LeT front organizations to contest the July general elections.
Pakistan experienced significant terrorist threats in 2018, although the number of
attacks  and  casualties  have  continued  to  decrease  from  previous  years.  The  major
terrorist groups that focused on conducting attacks in Pakistan included Tehrik-e-Taliban
Pakistan (TTP), Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), Islamic State’s Khorasan Province (ISIS-K), and
the  sectarian  group  Lashkar-e-Jhangvi  al-Alami  (LJA).  ISIS-K  claimed  several  major
attacks  against  Pakistani  targets,  some  of  which  may  have  been  conducted  in
collaboration  with  other  terrorist  groups.  Separatist  militant  groups  conducted  terrorist
attacks against governmental, non-governmental, and diplomatic targets in Balochistan
and  Sindh  provinces.  Groups  located  in  Pakistan,  but  focused  on  conducting  attacks
outside  the  country,  included  the  Afghan  Taliban,  HQN,  LeT  and  its  affiliated  front
organizations, and JeM. Terrorists used a range of tactics to attack individuals, schools,
markets, government institutions, and places of worship, including IEDs, VBIEDs, suicide
bombings, targeted assassinations, and rocket-propelled grenades.
Terrorist  Incidents:  Pakistan  has  experienced  numerous  recent  terrorist  attacks.
Militant  and  terrorist  groups  targeted  civilians,  journalists,  community  leaders,  security
forces,  law  enforcement  agents,  and  schools,  killing  and  injuring  hundreds.  Religious
minorities faced significant threats from terrorist groups.

Terrorist financing networks in Pakistan have come under scrutiny. In early 2018,
the  United  States  joined  Britain  in  urging  other  members  of  the  Paris-based  Financial
Action Task Force (FATF) to return Pakistan to its list of countries found to be insufficiently
combating money laundering and terrorism financing, where it had been listed from 2012
to 2015. In mid-2018, FATF formally added Pakistan to this “Gray List.”
Human  rights  issues  in  Pakistan  include  credible  reports  of  extrajudicial  and
targeted killings; forced disappearances; torture; arbitrary and lengthy pretrial detention;
arbitrary  or  unlawful  interference  with  privacy;  censorship,  site-blocking,  and  arbitrary
restrictions on journalists’ freedom of movement; severe harassment and intimidation of
and  high  profile  attacks  against  journalists  and  media  organizations;  government
restrictions on freedom of peaceful assembly and association, including overly restrictive
nongovernmental  organizations  (NGO)  laws;  restrictions  on  religious  freedom  and
discrimination against members of religious minority groups; restrictions on freedom of
movement;  corruption  within  the  government;  recruitment  and  use  of  child  soldiers  by
non-state militant groups; lack of criminal investigations or accountability for cases related
to rape, sexual harassment, so-called honor crimes, female genital mutilation/cutting, and
violence  based  on  gender,  gender  identity  and  sexual  orientation;  legal  prohibitions  of
consensual  same-sex  sexual  conduct;  forced  and  bonded  labor  and  transnational
trafficking in persons; and the worst forms of child labor.
In early 2017, after Pakistan’s military announced the nationwide Radd-ul-Fasaad
or  “Elimination  of  Strife”  operation  to  prevent  cross-border  terrorist  attacks  and  limit
militants’ access to explosives and weapons, government and military sources reported
scores of military and police operations to disarm, disrupt, kill, and apprehend terrorists.
Military  courts  operated  without  transparency  and  sentenced  at  least  104  convicted
terrorists to death in 2018, up from at least 15 in 2017.
The  Pakistani  military  and  intelligence  services  nominally  reported  to  civilian
authorities but essentially operated without effective civilian oversight. There was a lack
of government accountability, and abuses often went unpunished, fostering a culture of
impunity  among  the  perpetrators,  whether  official  or  unofficial.  Authorities  seldom
punished government officials for human rights abuses.
