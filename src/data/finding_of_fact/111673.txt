Applicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since about 2017. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which
he  has  held  since  about  2014.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2013.  He  has  never
married, and he has no children. He lives with his girlfriend. (Transcript (Tr.) at 40, 48-
49, 53, 97; GE 1, 4, 6; AE 1, 4)
There is no evidence that Applicant used illegal drugs before or after June 2017.
In  June 2017,  he  accepted  an offer from  a friend  to  smoke marijuana and  use  MDMA
(3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine),  a  controlled  substance  commonly  known  as
ecstasy.1  Applicant  decided  that  he  liked  marijuana,  and  he  purchased  about  three
ounces  of  marijuana  from  his  friend.  His  friend  also  gave  him  another  MDMA  pill.
Applicant stated in his October 2018 affidavit that he paid “approximately $300” for the
marijuana.  He  testified  he  paid  “about  $500.”  He  stated  that  the  marijuana  was  for his
personal use.  He  used  marijuana on a few  more occasions  in  June  2017.  Because of
police  intervention,  Applicant  never  had  the  opportunity  to  take  the  MDMA  pill  or  the
remainder of his marijuana. (Tr. at 52-55, 64, 82-84; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE
1; AE 1, 4)
In  June  2017,  Applicant  and  his  friends  were  driving  to  a  music  festival.  They
were  stopped  by  the  police  a  few  blocks  from  his  apartment.  Applicant  believes  a
confidential  informant  provided  the  information  to  the  police,  because  the  police  knew
who they were, where they were going, and that they had drugs in their possession that
they intended to use at the festival. The police searched the car and seized about five
grams  of marijuana  that  belonged  to  Applicant  and additional  marijuana  that belonged
to  the  other  passengers.  The  police  searched  Applicant’s  apartment  and  seized  the
MDMA pill that Applicant received from his friend and about three ounces of marijuana,
half of which belonged to Applicant’s roommate. (Tr. at 55-60, 84-84; GE 1, 4; AE 1, 4)
Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana with intent to
distribute and possession of a controlled substance. In June 2018, he pleaded guilty to
possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  and  the  other  charge  was  nolle  prosequi
(dismissed).  Imposition  of  sentence  was  suspended  for  one  year  conditioned  upon
Applicant’s good behavior through 12 months of probation. His probation included drug
testing and 100 hours of community service. (Tr. at 59-67, 87; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 1, 4, 5; AE 1, 4)
Applicant’s  employer  had  an  anti-drug  policy  that  prohibited  illegal  drug
possession  and  use.  His  supervisor  testified  that  Applicant  had  access  to  sensitive
information, but he did not have access to classified information. Applicant asserted that
he  applied  for a  security  clearance,  but  he  was  never  informed  that  he  had  a  security
clearance, and he never knew that he had a security clearance. (Tr. at 24-28, 49-52, 78,
90-98; GE 4, 7)

However,  in  a  May  2015  Questionnaire  for National Security  Positions  (SF 86),
Applicant wrote that he was investigated for a secret clearance with the date of action of
“04/2014.” He added: “Date of Action is when the investigation was initiated, not when
the  clearance  was  granted.  But  I  do  have  an  active  secret  clearance.”  Additionally,  in
the  resume  he  submitted  to  his  current  employer,  he  wrote  that  he  had  a  “Secret
Clearance with DOD Suitability.”2 (GE 2, 6)
Applicant  completed  all  the  terms  of  his  probation,  including  counseling.  His
therapist  did  “not  see  him  as  a  risk  for  future  court  involvement.”  The  charge  was
dismissed,  and  he  was  released  from  probation  in  June  2019.  He  stated  that  he  is
remorseful for his actions,  and he  has  learned  a  valuable  lesson. He  asserted  that  he
does  not  intend  to  use  marijuana  or  any  other  illegal  drug  in  the  future.  He  met  his
girlfriend after his drug involvement. She works for the U.S. Government and is strongly
opposed to illegal drug use. He is active in his church and volunteers in his community.
He no longer associates with his friends who used drugs. (Tr. at 38, 42-47, 64, 67-75,
81-82; GE 4; AE 1-4)
Applicant  called  witnesses  and  submitted  documents  attesting  to  his  good
character and excellent job performance. He is praised for his trustworthiness, reliability,
and dependability. (Tr. at 14-47; AE 3)
