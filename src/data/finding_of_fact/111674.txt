Applicant, age 36, is divorced with one minor child. The record did not specify when
he received his high school diploma. He attended a university specializing in aviation and
aerospace on a part-time basis from March 2015 through May 2016, without earning a
degree. As of May 2019, he was pursuing a degree in electrical engineering technology.
He served on active duty as an aerographer in the U.S. Navy from February 2008 until
February 2017, when he received a general discharge due to misconduct. At the time of
his  discharge,  he  was  a  first  class  petty  officer  (AG1).  Since  April  2017,  he  has  been
employed as a civilian contractor working as an administrative assistant supporting a U.S.
Navy human resources and administrative support contract. He has maintained a DOD
security clearance since 2008. (Item 3; Item 4 at 4, 5, 8-9, 19, 45; Item 5)
Under Guideline G, the SOR alleged four incidents involving Applicant’s excessive
alcohol consumption between 2004 and 2016 including: two driving under the influence
(DUI) convictions (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.d), and two other alcohol-related incidents, one at
work  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  and  one  away  from  work  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  It  also  alleged  that  he  was
diagnosed  with  a  severe  alcohol-use  disorder  (SOR  ¶  1.e)  and  that  he  continues  to
consume alcohol after a treatment recommendation to abstain (SOR ¶ 1.f). In his SOR
answer, Applicant admitted the facts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.f. (Items 1, 2)
Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana, with varying
frequency, from 2001 through 2016 (SOR ¶ 2.a), including after having been granted a
security clearance (SOR ¶ 2.b). It also alleged that he was diagnosed with a  cannabis
use disorder (SOR ¶ 2.c). In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted the facts alleged in SOR
¶¶ 2.a. – 2.c. However, he reported a period of abstinence from marijuana from 2008 until
2016. (Items 1, 2)
Guideline G
In 2004, Applicant consumed three to four rum-and-coke mixed drinks during an
unspecified period of time while at a club with friends. While he was driving home, a police
officer stopped  him for  an  unknown  reason. After failing  a field  sobriety  test,  Applicant
was arrested and charged with DUI, and spent 24 hours in jail. He was later convicted of
DUI and sentenced to 40 hours in jail, including the 24 hours he already served and 16
hours he served during weekends. He also paid a $300 fine. (Item 2 at 1; Item 4 at 16-
17)
In  2009,  while  on active  duty  with  the  U.S. Navy,  Applicant  consumed 10 to  12
beers one day between 2:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m. while at a barbeque with friends. The
following morning, he overslept and missed a mandatory briefing at work. A co-worker
came to his residence to wake him up and bring him to work. Once Applicant arrived at
work, his supervisor smelled alcohol emanating from him. He was verbally reprimanded
and  sent  to  a  10-day  outpatient  alcohol  treatment  program,  which  he  successfully
completed. (Item 3 at 42; Item 4 at 10)
In 2011, while on active duty with the U.S. Navy but on extended leave for training,
Applicant consumed an excessive amount of alcohol during an unspecified period of time
while at a house party with friends. At one point, he was asked to leave the party because
he  got  into  a  verbal  altercation  due  to  being  too  drunk  and  acting  out,  too  loud,  and
inappropriate  towards  female  guests  at  the  party.  He  left  that  house  and  walked  to  a
friend’s house nearby. Because his friend did not respond to his repeated knocking, he
lost his temper and kicked the sliding glass door causing it to break. Shortly thereafter,
he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  public  swearing  and  intoxication  (Charge  1)  and
destruction of property (Charge 2), and spent one night in jail. After his arrest, he learned
that he had been at the wrong house, which belonged to a stranger and not his friend.
Charge 2 was nolle prossed. Charge 1 was dismissed after he paid $800 in restitution.
His  command  ordered  him  to  undergo  a  30-day  inpatient  alcohol  treatment  program,
which he successfully completed. (Item 3 at 36-37, 42-43; Item 4 at 14, 23; Items 6, 8)
In February 2016, while on active duty with the U.S. Navy, Applicant consumed six
vodka shots and six beers while at dinner with a friend over an unspecified period of time.
After dinner, he drove the friend to a club, which was closed when they arrived. He then
drove them to a nearby park to wait for the club to open. They fell asleep while waiting.
Applicant, who was behind the wheel, was awoken by a police officer just before midnight.
After failing a field sobriety test and having a blood alcohol content over the legal limit,
Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI, and spent the night in jail. In October 2016,
after pleading not guilty, he was convicted of DUI and sentenced to  90 days in jail (85
days suspended), which he served on the weekends. His driver’s license was restricted
for one year, and he was ordered to install an interlock ignition device on his vehicle for
six months. He also paid a $250 fine. (Item 3 at 37-39, 42; Item 4 at 15-16; Item 7)
Applicant did not notify his command of his 2016 DUI for fear that he would get
into trouble. He was hoping that he could handle the matter on his own. However, his
command discovered the 2016 DUI during an internal background investigation that was
being  conducted  for  Applicant’s  potential  promotion.  In  October  2016,  Applicant  was
charged with violating Article 92 (failure to obey any order or regulation) for which he was
imposed the following non-judicial punishment: removal of recommendation for promotion
to E-7, reduction in rank to E-5 (suspended), and forfeiture of one-half month’s pay times
two (suspended). (Item 3 at 24; Item 4 at 9, 11-13)
In November 2016, after a command-ordered alcohol evaluation stemming from
his 2016 DUI, Applicant was admitted to a 35-day substance abuse rehabilitation program
(SARP) for the treatment of alcohol dependence. He was diagnosed with severe alcohol
use  disorder.  After  Applicant  was  notified  that  he  tested  positive  for  marijuana  during
intake,  he  disclosed  a  pattern  of  regular  marijuana  use  for  several  months  prior  to  his
admission to SARP. He was then also diagnosed with mild cannabis use disorder. Upon
his successful completion of SARP, he was discharged in December 2016. At discharge,
the initial two diagnoses remained unchanged, and the recommendations of his SARP
treatment  team  included  “Patient  remains  advised  to  abstain  from  all  alcohol  and  any
other  substance  use.”  These  recommendations  were  in  addition  to  the  terms  of  the
aftercare plan discussed below. Throughout his SARP treatment, Applicant was a very
active participant. As further validation of the improvement and work he achieved while
at SARP, he was selected by his peers and treatment team to be the student-speaker at
the commencement ceremony. (Item 2 at 2, 3; Item 3 at 43-44; Item 4 at 4, 11-12, 15, 22;
Item 9 at 3, 5, 6, 7, 9)
Following  his  discharge from  SARP  in  December  2016,  Applicant was  removed
from regular duty and required to engage in a continuing care program with a command-
approved aftercare plan (formulated with input from Applicant and his  SARP treatment
team)  over  the  following  12  months.  His  aftercare  plan  included  abstention  from  the
consumption of alcohol and  drugs,  participation  in  one  to  three  Alcoholics  Anonymous
(AA)  meetings  per  week,  participation  in  bi-weekly  outpatient  group  sessions,
participation in the Navy MORE program (a web-based tool to assist with personal growth
and  abstinence  during  the  first  year  of  recovery),  and  random  and  periodic  urinalysis
testing. (Item 4 at 4; Item 9 at 8-9, 12-24)
According to treatment records, Applicant reportedly abstained from alcohol while
participating in the continuing care program. However, he failed to follow other aftercare
plan  requirements  on  more  than  one  occasion.  Despite  repeated  reminders  of  his
requirement  to  do  so,  he  failed  to  complete  the  requisite  tasks  of  the  Navy  MORE
program. He failed to attend any AA meetings or contact his sponsor one week. He used
marijuana over the New Year’s holiday weekend in January 2017 and over the Valentine’s
Day weekend in February 2017. The details of his marijuana use during those weekends
were not specified in the record. His participation in the continuing care program ended
when he was discharged from the U.S. Navy in February 2017. (Item 4 at 4; Item 9 at 8-
9, 12-24)
During  his  April  2018  security  clearance  interview  (SI),  Applicant  reported  the
following history of his alcohol consumption: from 1999 to 2004, he drank three beers per
month; from 2004 to 2008, he drank one to six beers three to four times per week; from
2008 to 2009, during his first year in the military when he cut back his consumption to
stay in good physical condition, he drank three beers once per week; from 2009 to 2017,
he drank one to six beers three to four times per week; from 2017 through present, he
drank three beers per week. Although he averred that it took eight to ten beers for him to
become intoxicated, he admitted that he drank to intoxication every two weeks prior to his
2016 DUI. He maintained that he had not consumed alcohol to intoxication since his 2016
DUI.  He  acknowledged  that  he  had  a  problem  with  alcohol  and  that  he  took  action  to
control  it  by  attending  counseling  after  his  2016  DUI.  Inexplicably,  Applicant  did  not
reference any period of abstention from the consumption of alcohol, including while he
was participating in SARP treatment and the continuing care program. (Item 4 at 18-19)
In  May  2019,  Applicant  asserted  that  he  was  committed  to  abstaining  from  the
consumption of alcohol. He cited his child as his primary motivation for doing so. In his
October  2019  SOR  answer,  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  continued  to  consume
alcohol. He stated that when he “elects to partake in an alcohol beverage,” he ensures
that he partakes “responsibly.” He averred that he does not exceed three beverages and
“takes no chances in getting behind the wheel.” (Item 2 at 2; Item 4 at 5)
Guideline H
Applicant used marijuana during two periods of his life. The first period began in
either 2001 or 2002 and continued until 2007 when he began to transition into the military.
The second period began sometime after he separated from his wife in January 2015 and
continued through February 2017, during which time he was on active duty in the U.S.
Navy and in possession of a security clearance. The facts and circumstances underlying
his use during those two periods are not entirely clear due to a combination of the lack of
specific information in the record, and Applicant’s differing accounts. (Item 2 at 2-3; Item
3 at 40-41; Item 4 at 17-18, 23)
On his June 2017 SCA, Applicant reported October 2016 as his most recent use
of marijuana. He did not specify his frequency of use during the first period beyond stating
that  it  gradually  became  more  frequent  with  his  “heaviest  use”  to  be  “about  1/8  of  an
ounce per week.” He did not address the frequency of his use during the second period.
He  asserted  that  the  second  period  began  in  the  fall  of  2016,  when  he  had  “become
discouraged with senior leadership and could no longer support agendas outlined in new
polices.” He claimed that he used marijuana during the second period because he knew
that  finding  traces  of  marijuana  “would  open  a  door  for  [him]  to  transition  back  to  the
civilian  sector.”  He  answered  “No”  to  whether  he  had  ever  purchased  marijuana.  He
answered “No” to whether he intended to use marijuana in the future. (Item 3 at 40-41)
Applicant discussed his marijuana use during his April 2018 and May 2018 SIs. He
reiterated  that  he  had  not  used  marijuana  after  October  2016.  He  acknowledged  that,
upon enlistment in the U.S. Navy, he reported using marijuana 45 times during the first
period. He estimated that he used marijuana approximately six to eight times during the
second  period.  He  explained  that  he  used  marijuana  out  of  curiosity  and  because  he
enjoyed it. He attributed his use during the second period to providing him with an escape
from the stresses of reality as he dealt with  getting caught at work for his DUI and his
marital  separation.  He  reaffirmed  that  he  had  no  intent  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future
because of its negative impact on him. (Item 4 at 17-18, 23)
Applicant acknowledged during his April 2018 SI that he obtained the marijuana
he  used  during  both  periods  either  through  friends  or  by  purchasing  it  himself.  He
estimated that he purchased it approximately 20 times between 2003 and October 2016.
He  admitted  that  he  answered  “No”  to  the  question  on  his  SCA  about  purchasing
marijuana because he did not want to “look bad.” He asserted that he had no intent to
purchase  marijuana  in  the  future.  He  acknowledged  that  he  continued  to  associate
approximately one to two times per year with one of the friends with whom he had used
marijuana. (Item 4 at 17-18)
In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted that he used marijuana, but only through
December 2016. He recognized that he made a terrible decision to use marijuana, which
he  described  as  “haphazardly  lean[ing]  on  an  old  crutch.”  He  admitted  that  he  “lost
control,” which led him toward “an escapist mentality” towards the despair he felt at that
time  of  his  life  due  to  his  2016  DUI,  unfolding  divorce,  and  other  sensitive  matters
involving his wife. He asserted that after he tested positive for marijuana during his SARP
treatment, he “immediately shifted [his] mindset.” (Item 2 at 2-3; Item 4 at 5)
Whole Person
Applicant reported facts about the 2009, 2011, and 2016 alcohol-related incidents
on  his  2017  SCA.  He  was  interviewed  by  a  DOD  authorized  investigator  three  times
between April and May 2008 in connection with his security clearance. When asked why
he  failed  to  report  the  2004  DUI  on  his  SCA,  he  asserted  that  he  misunderstood  the
question and believed that he only had to report incidents within the prior seven years.
He failed to report, acknowledge, or otherwise address the two times he used marijuana
in  2017  (which  was  revealed  in  his treatment  records)  at any  point  during  the  security
clearance  process.  These  omissions  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  so  they  will  be
considered only to evaluate mitigation and the whole-person concept. (Item 3 at 36-39,
42-43; Item 4 at 16)
In February 2017, Applicant received a general discharge from the U.S. Navy for
serious misconduct because of his 2006  DUI  conviction  and having  tested positive for
marijuana. It was unclear in the record whether the discharge related to the positive test
for marijuana during his initial SARP intake or another test in February 2017. Applicant
asserted  that  it  related  to  the  intake  test,  but  his  treatment  records  show  that  he  was
required to submit to a urinalysis in February 2017, the results of which were not specified.
His military record revealed that an enlistment waiver had been approved for his 2004
DUI and prior marijuana use. (Item 3 at 23-24; Item 4 at 4, 11-13; Item 9 at 23)
Applicant  made  statements  in  his  SCA,  during  his  SIs,  and  in  his  SOR  answer
accepting responsibility for his excessive alcohol consumption and drug involvement. He
also offered excuses and explanations that were minimizing his behavior and culpability.
He maintained that he is no longer the same person who was involved in the incidents
alleged in the SOR and hopes that his story will help others avoid the mistakes he made.
(Item 2; Item 3 at 36-39, 42-43; Item 4 at 5, 10, 14-17, 23)
Applicant  was  promoted  by  his  employer  in  January  2018.  A  senior  manager
praised his “exemplary” work performance for which he has received accolades from his
superiors  and  peers.  In  her  role,  she  has  the  opportunity  to  observe  Applicant  on  a
consistent and regular basis. She has not witnessed Applicant consuming alcohol during
company events where alcohol is available. She has not seen or heard of any instances
where  Applicant  had  been  late  to  work,  or  appeared  to  be  under  the  influence  of  any
substance while at work. She proffered that Applicant has demonstrated a high level of
humility, integrity, and strong work ethic. Without specifying  the details of what he told
her, she stated that Applicant took “full ownership” for “his actions while in the military”
and the “poor decisions he made during that period in his life.” (Item 4 at 8; AE A)
