Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony at the hearing, and the documentary evidence in the
record, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant,  45,  works  as  an  engineer  for  a  defense  contractor.  He  began  this
employment in June 2019. He has worked for other defense contractors since April 2016
with  the  exception  of  a  two-month  period  in  late  2017.  Prior  to  April  2016,  he  was
unemployed for about six months due to being laid off. He received limited unemployment
compensation income during that period and took a job in 2016 that paid much less than
his prior position. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1997. He has never married, though
he  was  in  a  long-term  relationship  and  was  engaged  to  be  married.  That  relationship
ended in 2015. He has one child, age 19, who recently entered college. Applicant also
works at one or more part-time jobs to help support himself and his child. He keeps his
living expenses to a minimum. (AE A; AE B; Tr. at 11, 21, 24-28, 79-96.).
Applicant’s employment and personal life were stable until 2015 when his fiancé
left him and their child and Applicant was laid off in October 2015. These events caused
significant  disruptions  to  Applicant’s  life  and  finances.  He  is  still  trying  to  restore  his
finances  to  a  healthy  status.  Over  the  past  two  or  three  years,  he  has  consulted  with
attorneys  and  credit  advisors.  They  have  recommended  that  he  seek  help  through
bankruptcy. Applicant is familiar with Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings, but has been
advised that if he filed for bankruptcy, he would put his security clearance eligibility at risk.
Instead, he has pursued a strategy of disputing his debts with the assistance of a credit-
repair firm. (Tr. at 79-96, 103-105.)
GUIDELINE F, Financial Considerations
SOR  ¶ 1.a,  Mortgage  Loan  Account  Foreclosed –  In  approximately  2000,  Applicant
purchased a home for about $145,000. In 2007, he refinanced his mortgage loan with a
new loan in the amount of $296,989. In 2014, he used some of the additional funds to
purchase  an  investment  property  from  a  family  member.  In  late  2014,  he  began  to
experience  financial  difficulties,  in  part  because  he  lost  his  tenant  for  the  investment
property.  He  subsequently  lost  that  investment  property  to  foreclosure,  which  is  the
subject of SOR ¶ 1.h, discussed below. With his layoff in October 2015, he could no longer
pay the mortgage on his home and the bank foreclosed on the loan. The foreclosure was
completed in about February 2016. (GE 1 at 32; GE 2 at 2; GE 3 at 1; GE 4 at 5; Tr. at
16, 36-54.)
After the foreclosure, Applicant hired two or more firms to assist him in resolving
his numerous financial issues arising from his unemployment. He believes that he owes
the bank the entire balance on the mortgage loan, even though the Government’s credit
reports reflect a zero balance. He has received conflicting information about his obligation
on that loan after the foreclosure, but he believes he still owes all or most of this debt.
Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegation  regarding  the  foreclosure,  but  the  SOR  did  not
allege any deficiency debt. The hearing record is otherwise silent as to whether Applicant
has any responsibility for a deficiency on his mortgage loan following the foreclosure. The
SOR allegation regarding the foreclosure has been proven. (GE 1 at 32; GE 2 at 2; GE 3
at 1; GE 4 at 5; Tr. at 16, 36-54.)
SOR  ¶1.b,  Car  Loan  Account  Charged-Off  in  the  Amount  of  $22,693  –  Applicant
opened this account in 2014 to purchase a car for his former fiancé. When she ended
their relationship in 2015, she took the car. He defaulted on the loan in about September
2017. The lender repossessed the car. He hired a credit-repair firm, which disputed the
debt. Applicant provided evidence that the dispute was successful. He admitted this debt,
however,  in  his SOR answer.  Furthermore, he testified  that  even  though the  debt  was
removed from his credit report, he still was liable on the debt. He commented that he was
working with the creditor to establish a payment plan, but he provided no documentary
evidence of that. This debt has not been resolved. (GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 6; AE
D; Tr. at 54-59, 77.)
SOR ¶1.c, Bank Debt Placed for Collection in the Amount of $2,851 – In his March
2018 background interview, Applicant told the interviewer that he did not recognize this
debt, which was owed to a collection agency. He disputed this debt, presumably with the
help  of  his  credit-repair  firm,  and  denied  this  allegation  in  his  SOR  answer.  The  debt
appeared on the Government’s initial investigatory credit report, dated October 27, 2017,
(GE 4) as a collection account for a bank debt. The original debt was probably incurred
as  a  credit  account  for  a  consumer  purchase  because  GE  4  refers  to  a  “Factoring
Company Account.” The debt is also listed on the Government’s December 2018 credit
report (GE 3). Applicant has provided no documentary evidence reflecting that this debt
has  been  disputed  under  the  name  alleged  in  the  SOR  and  appearing  in  the
Government’s two credit reports in the record. (GE 2 at 3; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 8; Tr. at 59-
60.) This debt has not been resolved.
SOR ¶1.d,  Account with Bank Placed for Collection  in the  Amount of $758 – The
Government’s  credit  reports  identify  the  bank  and  its  collection  agency.  Applicant
recognized the name of this bank and claims that this debt has been paid. He testified
that he does not have a receipt for his payment because he paid this debt some time ago.
In  February  2018,  his  credit-repair  firm  disputed  the  debt.  The  debt  remains  on  GE  3,
dated  December  4,  2018,  with  a  notation  that  “[Applicant]  disputes  this  account
information.”  Applicant’s  evidence  does  not  support  a  finding  that  this  debt  has  been
resolved. (GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 9; AE L; Tr. at 60-63.)
SOR ¶1.e, Cable Account Placed for Collection in the Amount of $468 – This bill is
for cable service at an address vacated by Applicant in December 2016. He testified that
he has paid it, though he did not have a document at the hearing to substantiate his claim.
Post-hearing, he provided a copy of a receipt from the creditor reflecting that this debt
was paid in full on January 18, 2019. This debt has been resolved. (GE 3 at 2; AE F; Tr.
63-66.)
SOR ¶1.f, Account Placed for Collection in the Amount of $300 – Applicant did not
recognize this debt, which is presently with a collection agency.  GE 4 reflects that this
debt relates to a returned check. He disputed this debt through his credit-repair firm, but
as of the hearing date, he had not received a response to his dispute. After the hearing,
he provided a copy of the April 2018 dispute letter. The debt continues to appear on the
Government’s December 2018 credit report. This debt has not been resolved. (GE 2 at
4; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 4; AE J; Tr. 66-67.)
SOR  ¶1.g,  Credit-Card  Account  Charged-Off  in  the  Amount  of  $101  –  Applicant
recognized this debt and testified that he paid it three months prior to the hearing. He did
not provide a document evidencing this payment. Applicant’s evidence does not support
a finding that this debt has been resolved. (GE 3 at 2; Tr. 67-68.)
SOR  ¶1.h,  Mortgage-Loan  Account  Foreclosed  with a  Deficiency  of  $57,096  –  As
noted, Applicant purchased an investment property from a relative in 2014 using funds
he borrowed against the equity in his home. He initially testified that the purchase price
was $110,000. He subsequently testified that he paid $90,000 for the house. He made a
$35,000 or $40,000 down payment. He borrowed an additional $57,000 from a mortgage
lender. Following the closing, his cousin rented the property, but only lived there eight or
nine months. The property was vacant before the end of 2014. Applicant managed the
property on his own and was unable to find a new tenant. In 2015, he defaulted on the
mortgage  payment  on  the  investment  property.  Following  the  lender’s  foreclosure,  he
believes he owes a deficiency of about $55,000. Applicant has never made any payments
on this debt. GE 4 reflects an account balance of $57,054. In his March 2018 background
interview, he reportedly stated that he was working with his credit-repair firm to develop
a payment plan. After the hearing, he submitted a copy of a May 3, 2018 email from that
firm in which it requested that this debt be validated by the mortgage lender. No further
information  or  documentation  was  presented.  Applicant  admitted  this  foreclosure  and
deficiency debt in his April 17, 2019 SOR answer. This debt has not been resolved. (GE
2 at 3; GE 4 at 3; AE K; Tr. at 68-76.)
SOR ¶1.i, Communications Account Placed for Collection in the Amount of $584 –
Applicant opened this account in 2009 and defaulted on it in 2017. He testified that he
paid this bill and that it was erroneously included on his credit report. He was unable to
locate any documentation to prove that he paid this bill. His credit-repair firm disputed the
bill,  and  it  was  removed  from  his  credit  report  on  January  8,  2018,  according  to
documentation provided by Applicant after the hearing. The debt does not appear on GE
3, the Government’s December 2018 credit report. The evidence supports a finding that
this debt has been resolved. (GE 3; GE 4 at 4; AE H; Tr. 76-78.)
SOR ¶1.j, Communications Account Placed for Collection in the Amount of $1,513
–  This  account  belonged  to  his  former  fiancé.  He  closed  the  account,  and  in  2017,  it
became delinquent and was referred to a collection agency. He is disputing the amount
of the debt, although he does not claim that he paid this debt. It was removed from his
credit report in January 2018 and does not appear in GE 3. The evidence does not support
a finding that this debt has been resolved. (GE 3; GE 4 at 9; AE G; Tr. at 78-79.)
