Applicant,  41,  is  an  aircraft  worker  telecommunications  engineer  currently
employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  July  2019.  He  has  worked  for  defense
contractors since 2016. From 1997 until 2001, he served on active duty in the U.S. Navy,
where  he  held  a  security  clearance.  He  and  his  wife  married  in  2010  and  have  two
daughters, ages 21 and 9. (GX 1; Tr. 27.)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges 17 past-due accounts totaling $31,558. The
debts are comprised of a $20,111 debt to DFAS, 2 student loan accounts totaling $6,503,
2 credit-card accounts totaling $846, and 12 medical accounts totaling $4,098. Applicant
admits each of the debts and states that he is current on the student loan accounts, in a
repayment plan for two of the medical accounts, and that 10 of the accounts are closed.
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  E  that  Applicant  intentionally  falsified  his  security
clearance application by failing to disclose his delinquent accounts. Applicant denies this
allegation. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. The delinquent debts
are reflected in Applicant’s credit bureau reports (CBR) from January 2019 and December
2016, and discussed in his January 2018 personal subject interview (PSI). (GX 4; GX 3;
GX 2.)
Applicant enlisted in the Navy in 1997 for a four-year commitment. While deployed
in  a  combat  zone  in  1999,  he  reenlisted  for  an  additional  six  years.  He  received  a
reenlistment bonus of $32,000, to be paid in several installments. He received the first
installment  of  $14,000  in  October  2000.  Shortly  after  receiving  the  bonus  payment,
Applicant  used  the  money  to  purchase  a  truck.  He  received  a  second  installment  of
approximately $1,700 in 2001. (Tr. 49-54.)
In  October  2001,  Applicant  tested  positive  for  amphetamines  in  a  urinalysis.
Ultimately, he received an other than honorable discharge. As a result of not fulfilling the
terms of his reenlistment, Applicant was obligated to repay his reenlistment bonus. The
account became delinquent in the amount of $20,111 (SOR ¶ 1.n).
Since 2002, DFAS has captured Applicant’s Federal tax refunds and applied them
to the debt. Over the years, Applicant also made several unscheduled payments. He has
called DFAS about 12 times over the past 10 years in an effort to establish a repayment
plan, but has been unable to reach an agreement. On his most recent call, he was told
that the only way he could bring the delinquent account current was to pay the balance in
full. (Tr. 56-57.) In April 2019, Applicant began making payments through an application
on his phone. He has made a $550 payment and two payments of $200. He will continue
to pay $400 a month until the debt is paid off. As of October 9, 2019, the balance on the
DFAS account was $12,588 and is not accruing interest. His payments total $9,459. (GX
1; Tr. 65-66; AX J; AX F.) SOR ¶ 1.n is being resolved.
Applicant  enrolled  in  college  courses  in  about  2005,  under  the  erroneous
impression that his tuition would be covered under the G.I. Bill. Applicant ended up using
student loans to pay the tuition. He fell behind on payments and defaulted on the $3,991
(SOR ¶ 1.a) and $2,512 (SOR ¶ 1.b) loans. He entered monthly repayment plans for each
loan in September 2017, and the loans are in current status. (AX I.) SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b
are being resolved.
Applicant  incurred  $4,098  in  delinquent  medical  debt  as  a  result  of  medical
expenses that were not paid by his insurance. (Tr. 39-40.) He has entered a repayment
plan that combines the two largest debts, $1,223 (SOR ¶ 1.c) and $1,060 (SOR ¶ 1.d).
His $200 bimonthly payments are automatically debited from his checking account. The
debt will be paid off in August 2020. (AX K.) SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d are being resolved.
Applicant paid the medical debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.j, 1.m, 1o, and 1.q and
settled 1.f and 1.l. These debts total $1,339. He was unable to find the creditors for SOR
¶ 1.h $117, 1.k $134, and 1.p. $225. The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g through 1.q do not
appear on Applicant’s recent CBRs. (AX G – AX I.) These debts are resolved.
Applicant  paid  the  credit-card  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.e  $515  and  1.f  $331.
These debts are resolved. (AX G – AX I.)
Applicant emphatically stated that he did not intentionally falsify his e-QIP by failing
to disclose his delinquent debts. Applicant was given the e-QIP to complete while he was
at work. He felt pressured to complete it quickly and get back to work. He was aware of
his DFAS debt, but was not aware of the other debts. He had never viewed his CBR until
his PSI. (Tr. 42-43; Tr. 68-69.)
Applicant’s previous supervisor while Applicant was in the Navy and current friend
has  known  Applicant  for  almost  10  years and  highly  recommends  him  for a  clearance
stating that he is capable, honest, and trustworthy. Applicant’s coworker since February
2019 recommends Applicant for a clearance and states that Applicant is trustworthy and
obeys rules and regulations. (AX C.).
Applicant admits that he did not manage his finances well when he was younger
and this was the primary cause of his debts. (Tr. 33.) He did not fully grasp the security
significance of poor finances until undergoing the security clearance process. (Tr. 44-45.)
He sought credit counseling through several different agencies but thought the monthly
fees  were  unreasonable.  (Tr.  65.)  Applicant  has  a  credit-monitoring  application  on  his
phone that alerts him when payments are due and through which he can directly contact
his creditors. His credit score has improved by 130 points. (Tr. 60.) He also has an online
account  with  a  credit  reporting  agency  through  which  he  monitors  and  maintains  his
accounts.  He  and  his  wife  maintain  a  monthly  budget.  Applicant  is  current  on  all  his
ongoing financial obligations and has not incurred any recent delinquent debts. He was
candid, sincere, and credible while testifying.
