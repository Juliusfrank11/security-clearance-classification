In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c
and 1.e-1.l. He denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.d. His admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact. In the FORM, Department Counsel amended SOR ¶ 1.l and added
SOR ¶¶ 1.m-1.o. Although the Government’s submission requested that Applicant admit
or  deny  the  amendments  to  the  SOR,  he  did  not.  I  have  treated  Applicant’s  failure  to
respond to the amendment of SOR ¶ 1.l and the addition of SOR ¶¶ 1.m-1.o as denials.
Applicant  is  a  49-year-old  audio-visual  technician  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since September 2015. He obtained a master’s degree from a U.S. university
in June 2007. He worked for a non-government telecommunications company from May
1998  to  May  2015,  took  an  early  retirement,  and  was  unemployed  from  May  to
September 2015. He has never held a security clearance.
Applicant  married  in  July  1995,  divorced  in  July  1997,  and  married  again  in
August 1997. He has two children, ages 20 and 13.
The SOR as amended alleges 15 delinquent debts totaling about $286,943. They
include  delinquent  federal  and  state  taxes,  two  delinquent  mortgage  loans,  and  two
delinquent  consumer  debts.  The  evidence  concerning  his  delinquent  debts
is
summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: state tax lien entered in 2016 for $4,037. In Applicant’s answer to
the SOR, he stated that he has an installment agreement and is paying $64 per month.
In his response to the FORM, he submitted documentation of his payment agreement,
showing  that  he  had  made  two  $64  payments,  with  58  payments  remaining,  as  of
December  2019.  (AX  B.)  The  document  does  not  reflect  when  he  and  the  state  tax
authority reached an agreement, but the timing of the payments indicates that it was not
until late 2019.
SOR ¶ 1.b: federal tax lien entered in 2015 for $18,437. This tax lien was filed
for the taxes due for tax year 2011. It has not been satisfied. (Item 7 at 2.)
SOR ¶ 1.c: federal tax lien entered in 2011 for $38,776. This tax lien was filed
for  the  taxes  due  for  tax  years  2007  through  2010.  (Item  7  at  3.)  It  has  not  been
satisfied.
SOR ¶ 1.d: delinquent mortgage loan charged off for $57,322. In Applicant’s
answer to the SOR, he stated that this debt was charged off and that he had included
the amount in income, suggesting that the debt was forgiven. However  he provided no
documentation to support his explanation.
SOR  ¶¶  1.e  and  1.f:  consumer  debt  placed  for  collection  of  $3,732  and
credit-card  account  placed  for  collection  of  $3,724.  In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the
SOR,  he  claimed  that  these  debts  are  duplicates.  Both  were  referred  to  the  same
collection agency,  but the original creditors are  different and the  account  numbers are
different. (Item 9 at 7.) In his answer to the SOR, Applicant attributed the debts in SOR
¶¶ 1.e and 1.f to credit-card fraud, but he provided no documentary evidence to support
his explanation. They are not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.g:  delinquent  mortgage  loan  past  due  for  $99,464;  in  foreclosure
with balance of $489,290. The judgment of foreclosure reflects that Applicant owed the
lender  $484,014  when  the  judgment  was  entered  in  June  2019.  (Item  11  at  1.)  The
property was sold back to the lender for $320,200 in July 2019. (Item 11 at 8.) There is
no evidence that the deficiency has been forgiven or otherwise resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.h:  delinquent  federal  taxes  of  $12,698  for  tax  year  2010.  These
delinquent taxes were part of the basis for the tax lien alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. They are
not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.i:  delinquent  federal  taxes  of  $25,175  for  tax  year  2011.  This  debt
was the basis for the tax lien alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. They are not resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.j and k: delinquent federal taxes of $18,662 for tax year 2014 and
$33,791 for tax  year 2015. In Applicant’s answer to the SOR and his response to the
FORM, he stated that he has paid a tax professional $16,000 to consolidate his tax debt
and  submit  an  offer  in  compromise  to  the  IRS.  He  submitted  no  evidence  that  the  tax
professional  has  yet  accomplished  any  of  these  tasks.  After  the  hearing,  Applicant
submitted  AX  C  and  D,  which  are  federal  income  tax  returns  completed  by  a
professional  tax  preparer  for  tax  years  2017  and  2018,  showing  that  Applicant  owes
$4,454 for 2017 and $5,852 for 2018. He also submitted a cover email explaining that
he needed to file these returns to complete his offer in compromise. (AX E.) There is no
evidence that the forms were sent or received by the IRS and no evidence of payments.
SOR  ¶  1.l  (amended  in  FORM):  failure  to  timely  file  federal  income  tax
return for tax years 2016 and 2017. As of June 2019, these returns had not been filed.
(Item 6 at 11-12.) In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he stated that his tax professional
would file the returns. There is no evidence that the 2016 return has been prepared or
filed. Applicant submitted evidence that a federal income tax return for 2017 had been
prepared, but no evidence that it had been filed. (AX C.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.m-1.o (amended in FORM): delinquent federal taxes of $10,051 for
tax year 2007; $1,661 for tax year 2008; and $16,624 for tax year 2009. The tax lien
alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  was  based  on  these  delinquent  taxes  as  well  as  the  delinquent
taxes for tax year 2010. Applicant did not respond to these allegations in his answer to
the SOR or response to the FORM. They are reflected in FORM Item 5 at 23.
When  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in  March  2018,  he
attributed his financial problems to the results of an IRS audit of his returns around 2007
through 2012 that disallowed many of the deductions he had taken and to being heavily
taxed on his early withdrawal of funds from his retirement account. (Item 5 at 13.) In his
answer to the SOR, he attributed his financial problems to leaving a higher-paying job to
be closer to his family and the expenses of caring for his mother-in-law, who lives with
him  and  is  in  remission  from  cancer,  and  caring  for  his  mother,  who  has  required
extensive medical care. He provided no documentation of the medical and related costs
of caring for his mother-in-law and mother.
