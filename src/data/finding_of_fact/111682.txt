Applicant  admitted  the  debts  alleged  at  SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  1.d-1.f,  and  1.i-1.y.  She
denied  the  debts  alleged  at  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.c,  1.g,  and  1.h.  She  provided  a  narrative
explanation with her answer. Her admissions and explanation are incorporated into the
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  the  record
evidence submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 36 years old. After graduating from high school in 2001, she served
on active duty in the U.S. Air Force, from 2001 to 2007, and in the Air Force Reserve,
from 2007 to 2014. She was discharged honorably with the rank of tech sergeant (E-6),
and she held a clearance in the Air Force. Applicant has earned an associate degree.
(GE 1, GE 2; Tr. 27-28)
From 2009 to October 2013, Applicant worked for DOD as an aircraft electrician.
She  then  went  to  work  for  a  large  defense  contractor,  in  a  similar  role.  She  was
assigned  to  work  at  an  air  base  in  England.  She  worked  there  for  two  years,  until
August 2015. She then returned to the United States, and has worked in her current job,
with the same employer, since September 2015. She is seeking to retain her clearance.
(GE 1, GE 2, Tr. 28-29, 32-40)
Applicant  was  married  from  2004  until  2016,  when  she  and  her  husband
divorced. (AE A) They have three children, ages 12, 10, and 6. They share joint custody
but the children live with their father. (Tr. 26-27)
Applicant  testified  that  her  financial  issues  began  when  she  was  working  in
England. Both she and her then husband, who is employed by the same company, were
sent  to  England  on  unaccompanied  tours.  However,  they  brought  their  children  with
them  as  well  as  Applicant’s  mother.  This  proved  to  be  more  expensive  than  they  had
planned,  because  they  only  received  food  and  housing  stipends  for  unaccompanied
tours. They also had to pay for visas so their family members could stay with them. (Tr.
29-30, 35-39)
Applicant testified that she and her husband separated when they returned to the
United States, in early September 2015. Her husband took their children to live with his
mother during this time. In June 2016, Applicant’s ex-husband returned the children to
her, and she raised them with little financial support from him. This, too, was a financial
hardship.  The  children  now  live  with  their  father,  and  she  pays  $163  a  week  in  child
support. Applicant now lives with her fiancé and her mother. (Tr. 30, 40-41)
Applicant testified that while they  were in England, her company  was supposed
to  pay  for  local  taxes.  The  company  did  so,  but  at  a  rate  or  amount  higher  than
authorized. As a result, Applicant pays $75 a week to reimburse the company. (Tr. 31-
32)
Applicant  also  acknowledged  that  she  and  her  husband  managed  their  money
poorly during their  marriage. He had bad credit when they married, so many accounts
were in her name. (Tr. 37)
The  SOR  alleges  about  $56,000  in  medical  debts  and  past-due  credit  card
accounts.  They  are  established  by  Applicant’s  credit  reports.  (GE  3,  GE  4)  With  her
Answer, Applicant included a chart detailing her intended efforts to resolve these debts
over the next two years (2019-2021) (AE E)
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  ($14,561)  and  1.c  ($9,986)  are  credit  card  debts.  Applicant  denied
them  and  documented  that  her  former  husband  has  been  assigned  responsibility  for
them in the divorce decree. (Tr. 41-44; AE A at 3)
SOR ¶ 1.b ($11,517) is a debt to the same credit card company as SOR ¶ 1.a.
Applicant testified that she cannot log into the account to attempt to resolve it. (Tr. 43)
SOR  ¶ 1.d  ($4,888) is  a  charged-off  credit  card.  Applicant  stopped  using  it  in  January
2015 when she “maxed out” the account. She has not attempted to resolve it. (Tr. 45)
SOR ¶ 1.e ($1,995) is a charged-off credit card account with a hardware store. She has
not attempted to resolve it. (Tr. 45-46)
SOR  ¶¶  1.g  ($1,675)  and  1.h  ($1,672)  are  delinquent  debts  to  consumer
accounts  for  military  personnel.  Applicant  denied  the  debts  on  the  grounds  that  they
were resolved when the government applied her federal tax refund to them. (Tr. 49, 69-
70) AE C includes IRS account transcripts from tax years 2014-2018. AE C shows that
the IRS applied Applicant’s tax refunds to several federal debts. She testified that after
she withdrew from school, she also had to repay certain  funds she received under the
GI  Bill.  (Tr.  49-51)  Both  SOR  ¶¶  1.g  and  1.h  are  listed  on  Applicant’s  January  2019
credit  report.  (GE  4)  Applicant  believes  the  garnishments  that  resolved  them  have
ended,  but  it  is  not  clear  which  debts  were  resolved  by  recapturing  of  Applicant’s  tax
returns. (Tr. 69-70; AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.n ($606) is a past-due account to an online retailer. Applicant provided
documentation  with  her  Answer  that  she  has  set  up  a  plan  to  repay  the  debt  during
2019 with six automatic monthly payments of about $75. (AE F) At her hearing, she was
unsure if the debt had been resolved. (Tr. 70-72) She settled the debt in October 2019.
(AE M, AE N)
SOR  ¶  1.u  ($213),  as  amended,  is  a  past-due  debt  to  a  power  company.
Applicant resolved the debt after the hearing. (AE J) SOR ¶ 1.x ($126) is a debt to an
apartment complex where she lived from April 2016 to June 2017 before moving in with
her fiancé. She is unsure what the debt concerns. She looked into it initially but the debt
remains unresolved. (Tr. 57-58)
SOR  ¶  1.y  ($1,055)  is  a  debt  placed  for  collection  by  a  phone  company.
Applicant  stated  in  her  Answer  that  she  has  set  up  an  automatic  payment  plan.  She
documented her efforts after the hearing. (Tr. 59-61; AE G, AE H, AE I)
Applicant  incurred  numerous  delinquent  medical  debts  since  returning  from
England.  These  include  SOR  ¶¶  1.f  ($1,701),  1.i  ($982),  1.j  ($903),  1.k  ($851),  1.l
($724), 1.m (671), 1.o ($445), 1.p ($438), 1.q ($407), 1.r ($$315), 1.s ($242), 1.t ($216),
1.v  ($172),  and  1.w  ($148).  She  testified  that  this  is  due  to  having  a  high  deductible
($3,500)  on  her  insurance  plan.  Many  of  the  medical  debts  are  for  emergency  room
visits  for her children. She  has  not  established  a  repayment  plan for any  of them.  (Tr.
46-48, 51-54, 57)
Applicant earns about $500 to $550 a week, or about $2,000 a month. She has
$75 taken out per week to reimburse her company, and $163 weekly for child support,
as noted above. Her other garnishments have ceased. She lives paycheck to paycheck,
though she has about $30,000 in her company’s 401(k) plan. She lives with her fiancé.
She does not pay rent and does not have a car payment. She no longer has any credit
cards. She has not pursued credit counseling. (Tr. 61-70; AE D, K)
Applicant provided three character letters from references at work. They attest to
her  excellent  performance  and  leadership  skills,  as  well  as  to  her  character  and
dedication. She has a good moral character and a sense of integrity. (AE L)
