Applicant is 62 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1979, and began his
current employment with a defense contractor in February 1998. He has successfully held
Secret and Top Secret security clearances since 1984. He never served in the military or
held a Federal civil service position. (GE 1; GE 2; AE 1.)
Applicant  and  his  first  wife  divorced  in  2001,  after  21  years  of  marriage.  He
remarried in 2005, but he and his second wife separated in 2017. His wife continues to
live in their primary residence with her adult special-needs daughter, and he moved into
one of their investment rental properties. Applicant provides full financial support for his
wife and stepdaughter, and endeavors to maintain an amicable relationship with them.
His  wife  earns  no  income  other  than  receiving  state  payments  for  support  and
maintenance of her daughter. (GE 1; Tr. 34-43.)
In 2011, Applicant and his wife purchased a condominium (hereafter, ‘the condo’)
in Hawaii, where they had been vacationing as a family for several years. The purchase
was arranged by Applicant’s wife, and largely financed with a 50% down payment from
funds that she had just received as the beneficiary of her former husband’s life insurance
policy. They used the condo about two weeks per year for vacations, and hired a rental
agency to offer it for use by other vacationers. The condo was not a source of income for
the  family,  since  the  costs  of  ownership  significantly  exceeded  annual  rental  receipts.
Because it was offered to renters, however, Applicant believed they were required to file
nonresident  Hawaii  state  income  tax  returns,  and  include  the  condo  information  when
preparing their Federal returns. (GE 2; Tr. 37-41, 45-46.)
Applicant and his wife did not file Hawaii state income tax returns for 2011 through
2017  in  connection  with  their  rental  of  the  Hawaii  condo.  Applicant  volunteered  this
information  in  his  March  14,  2019  response  to  DOHA  financial  interrogatories.  He
explained that he was aware of most of the expenses associated with the condo, since
he paid them, but his wife exclusively dealt with the rental agency and refused to provide
him or their former certified public accountant (CPA) with rental income information to use
in preparing and filing those tax returns. This lack of information also led to the late filing
of Applicant’s Federal tax returns for 2014, 2016, and 2017. (GE 2; Tr. 36-37, 40-45.)
Applicant initially responded to his tax return preparation problems by ensuring that
he  had  more  than  enough  money  withheld  from  his  paychecks  to  cover  any  potential
Federal tax liability. He knew that the condo lost money every year, and did not generate
actual Hawaii state tax liability. More recently, he hired a new CPA who was willing and
able to spend sufficient time to obtain the necessary condo information from his estranged
wife. (Tr. 32-34, 46, 52.)
Applicant, with the assistance of his CPA, filed his SOR-alleged delinquent Federal
income tax returns on the following dates, resulting in refunds, according to the IRS tax
account records that he provided:

Total tax due and paid:

$10,653
Applicant also submitted his IRS account records for the other tax years between 2011
and  2018,  which  documented  refunds  ranging  from  $5,431  to  $13,530  and  totaling
$40,094.  Applicant  credibly  affirmed  that  he  has  never  intended  to  avoid  paying  his
income tax liabilities, and regrets the inter-personal problems that precluded his timely
filing of several returns. He chose to over-withhold large amounts each year in order to
ensure  that  he  paid  his  taxes  in  a  timely  fashion  while  personally  incurring  any  cost
associated with his return filing problems. (AE 5; Tr. 33-34, 46.)
Applicant’s  accountant  completed  researching  and  preparing  the  non-resident
Hawaii income tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2018 on November 18, 2019. After
he was able to obtain his wife’s signature on the joint returns, Applicant filed them with
the  state,  where  they  were  received  on  November  25,  2019.  The  returns  reflected  no
(zero) taxable income for any of the years involved. Applicant’s state of residence does
not have a state income tax. (AE 8.)
Applicant provided a family financial statement documenting a monthly remainder
of  $2,195  after  meeting  routine  liabilities  and  living  expenses,  and  total  assets  of  just
under  $3  million.  He  also  provided  copies  of  his  performance  evaluations,
commendations, awards, and qualifications, which document his sustained outstanding
performance in increasingly demanding duties. He also provided affidavits from longtime
coworkers,  attesting  to  his  excellent  character,  integrity,  and  trustworthiness.  His
testimony was forthright, and his concern for safeguarding national security interests was
manifest. (AE 2; AE 3; AE 4; AE 6.)
