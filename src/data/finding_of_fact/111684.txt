The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the March 29, 2019 SOR, Applicant
owed $62,279 in delinquent federal taxes for tax years 2012 through 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.b). In
2018, his home state entered a $4,267 tax lien (SOR ¶ 1.c) against him. (Item 8) He was
$32,100 past due on his mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.d) with a balance of $621,081; $1,341 past
due on an automobile loan account (SOR ¶ 1.e) with a balance of $25,613; and $171 past
due  on  an  automobile  loan  account  (SOR  ¶  1.f)  with  a  balance  of  $14,491.  The  SOR
alleged he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in September 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.a). That
bankruptcy  was  discharged  in  October  2016.  Applicant  had  also  filed  for  Chapter  13
bankruptcy protection in April 2009, which was not alleged in the SOR. That bankruptcy
action had been dismissed.
When  Applicant  answered  the  SOR  allegations,  he  admitted  that  the  debts  are
legitimate and attributed them to having made overpayments on his bankruptcy. (Item 3)
He  was  unaware that he could readjust the amount of his payments. In July 2018, he
submitted an IRS FORM 433-D, Installment Agreement. The IRS indicated the payment
plan was being processed and no payments had been made. Applicant asserted he was
working  with  a  local  tax  attorney  in  an  attempt  to  correct  the  debt.  (Item  3)  Applicant
provided no documentation related to his association with the local tax attorney or actions
taken concerning his tax debt. In his SOR response, Applicant stated he owed the state tax
lien and was considering working with a local tax attorney concerning the tax lien. (Item 3)
Applicant admitted being past due on his mortgage, and had attempted to work with
the mortgage company, but was unable to get a loan modification. (Item 3) Being $32,100
past due would represent nonpayment on his mortgage for 14 months. He stated he would
be  leaving  the  home  following  a  sheriff’s  sale  on  August  5,  2019.  He  provided  no
documentation related to the sheriff’s sale or any funds owed following the sale. He stated
he and his wife had separated, and he would be renting a room and his wife would move in
with family. (Item 3)
Applicant admitted being past due on his wife’s vehicle (SOR ¶ 1.e) and his vehicle
(SOR ¶ 1.f). He indicated that after the foreclosure was completed and they moved out of
the home, he would contact the lenders of the automobile loan accounts to work with them
to  become  caught  up  on  past-due  payments.  (Item  3)  He  provided  no  documentation
showing  what  if  anything  has  been  done  concerning  the  past-due  automobile  loan
accounts.
After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant’s Answer to the SOR (Item 3),
I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant  is a  48-year-old  technology consultant who has worked for a defense
contractor  since  December  1999.  In  November  1992,  he  was  granted  sensitive
compartmented information (SCI) access. He and his spouse married in March 2005, and
they have an 11-year-old son. (Item 3.)
On  August  21,  2017,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  an
Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). (Item 4) He indicated he
had filed for Chapter 13, Wage Earner’s Plan, bankruptcy relief in September 2009. The
plan listed assets of $640,073 and liabilities of $990,350. (Item 10) His case was dismissed
in July 2011 due to the inability of their attorney to get the case confirmed. Applicant and
his wife refiled for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief in September 2011. They filed bankruptcy
because his retail business, a book company, had failed. (Item 4) Other than stating the
company failed due to low sales and insolvency, he provided no details or specifics about
the business or provided any documentation related to the business.
Applicant listed on his e-QIP he owed $6,867 for tax year 2012; $7,049 for tax year
2013; $12,638 for tax year 2014; $15,962 for tax year 2015; and $14,030 for tax year 2016.
The total amount of delinquent taxes listed was $56,546. (Item 4) He listed $45,216 being
more than 120 days delinquent on rental property and $101,752 being more than 120 days
delinquent  on  the  mortgage  of  his  primary  residence.  (Item  3)  A  $101,752  delinquent
mortgage of would represent 34 months of delinquency.
A check of Applicant’s credit on October 18, 2018, revealed $32,100 past due on his
mortgage, $1,341 past due on one car loan, and $171 past due on the other car loan. (Item
6)
On October 18, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  and  an  enhanced  subject  interview  was
conducted. (Item 5) As of the date of the interview, Applicant indicated his mortgage loan
had been modified reducing his monthly payments to $2,279 for the original amount of
$2,938. (Items 5 and 7) He indicated he was four months delinquent on his payments. He
indicated he owed $66,546 in state and Federal delinquent income taxes.
Applicant explained his book business failed. He had moved his book business to a
new location in hope of better sales. This was not to be and his landlord filed a lien against
him. Other creditors demanded payment as well. (Item 5) In October 2011 due to his book
business failure, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief. The plan required bi-
monthly payments of $1,269, which by April 2016, would pay off $137,101 in debt. (Item 5)
The plan listed assets of $623,430 and liabilities of $1,167,931. (Item 9) Secured debt was
$839,272.  (Item  9)  Applicant’s  monthly  gross  wages  was  listed  as  $10,416  and  his
spouse’s monthly gross income was $1,594. (Item 9) The plan listed $71,475 in taxes due.
(Item 9) Making the monthly payments under the bankruptcy plan made it difficult to pay
the basis living expenses. (Ex. 5)
In October 2011, in order to generate additional income, Applicant started working
an extra job as a deejay. His deejay job generated $15,000 to $22,000 in profit per year
from 2011 to 2016. (Item 5) He failed to set aside taxes to cover this additional amount of
income. (Item 5) He realizes he should have consulted a tax attorney when he started his
deejay  business.  (Item  5)  Applicant’s  income  was  affected  by  a  loss  of  the  use  of  a
company  car  and  then  loss  of  $400  weekly  reimbursement  for  the  use  of  his  private
automobile, which resulted in a loss of income of $19,300.
In  October  2016,  Applicant  started  working  a  seasonal/part-time  job  at  a  big
hardware appliance store. In May 2017, he resigned his job when the store wanted him to
work full time. He was unable to work two full-time jobs. (Item 5) He is very concerned
about the impact his finances could have on his ability to retain his security clearance.
(Item 5) As of the enhanced subject interview in October 2017, his primary concern was
paying off his tax debt and making timely payments on his mortgage, rent, car payments,
and utilities. (Item 5)
In the August 29, 2019 FORM, Applicant was placed on notice of the Government’s
concern  about  his failure  to  provide  any  documentary  evidence  to  show  that he acted
responsibly toward his creditors or that he has any repayment plans in place for his debts.
In rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant had an opportunity to provide information of his current
income,  actions  he  has  taken  to  address  his  financial  problems,  and  of  contacts  with
creditors  taken  to  address  the  repayment  of  his  debts.  There  is  no  indication  that  he
responded by the October 10, 2019 deadline.
