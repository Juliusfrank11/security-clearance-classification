Applicant  is  42,  married,  and  has  two  young  children.  In  2001,  he  received  a
bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, and in 2008, he received a master’s degree
in business administration. He previously held a security clearance from approximately
2003 until 2011. He has worked for a defense contractor (DC 1) as a program manager
since February 2017. (GE 1; Tr. 9-12)
Applicant started experimenting with drugs while he was in college. He continued
to use drugs after he graduated in 2001. The majority of his drug use occurred  before
2001, but he continued to use drugs occasionally until 2006. (GE 1 at 52-53; GE 2 at 7;
GE 3 at 2; AE A; Tr. 54-55)
Applicant used Ketamine two to three times between 1997 and 1998. He used and
purchased  LSD  approximately  five  times  in  1997  and  1998.  He  used  psychedelic
mushrooms once in 1998, and once in 2010 at his bachelor party. Applicant used Ecstasy
10 to 15 times between 2001 and 2003, prior to obtaining a security clearance. He used
and purchased cocaine 10 to 20 times between 2004 and 2006, while holding a security
clearance.  Applicant’s drug  use  primarily  took  place  on the  weekends  while  he  was  at
parties with his friends. (GE 1 at 52-53; GE 2 at 7; GE 3 at 2; AE A; Tr. 30-31, 41-44)
Applicant purchased marijuana and used it approximately 15 to 25 times between
1999 and 2006.  He used marijuana again approximately three to five times between July
and November 2016. At that time, he lived in a state in which recreational marijuana use
is legal, and he was employed as the vice president of product development for a small
start-up company. He was not considering seeking further government employment. (GE
1 at 50-51; GE 2 at 6-7; GE 3 at 2; AE A; Tr. 29-30, 34, 40, 47-51, 53-54)
Applicant  stopped using  marijuana  in  late  2016,  because  he  decided  it  was  not
conducive to his family life. He has not used any  illegal drugs since late 2016, and he
stopped using them prior to applying for and accepting a position with DC 1 in early 2017.
(GE 1 at 50-51; GE 2 at 6-7; GE 3 at 2; AE A; Tr. 29-30, 34, 40, 49-51)
Applicant worked for DC 1 from March 2001 until October 2002, when his position
was downsized. He applied for a security clearance during this employment, but was laid
off before the clearance investigation was completed. At the hearing, Applicant admitted
that he probably did not disclose his drug use between 1999 and 2001 when he completed
this SCA. (GE 1; Tr. 31-33, 37-39)
Applicant was rehired by DC 1 in March 2003, and he almost immediately received
a security clearance based upon his initial application. According to Applicant, the security
clearance process “didn’t really sink in,” and he “continued a pattern of behavior that [he
now realizes] is not becoming of individuals” who hold a security clearance. He was aware
that drug use was inconsistent with his employment at DC 1 and inconsistent with holding
a security clearance. (AE A; Tr. 31-32, 39-40, 47-48)
In late 2010, DC 1 sponsored Applicant for a top secret clearance with sensitive
compartmented information access (TS/SCI). In 2011, during an interview, he disclosed
all  of  his  drug  use,  including  his  drug  use  while  holding  a  security  clearance.  He  also
indicated that he intended to abstain from drug use in the future. Applicant left DC 1  in
late December 2011, prior to the adjudication of this upgrade. Applicant worked for non-
government-related companies from December 2011 until February 2017, when he was
rehired by DC 1. (GE 1 at 55; Tr. 40, 45-47)
Applicant was drug tested by DC 1 in 2001, 2003, 2007, and in 2017. He did not
test positive for any drugs on any of these tests. He was drug tested by a non-government
employer in 2011 or 2012. (Tr. 29, 45)
Applicant’s supervisor (Supervisor) from 2017 until early 2019 testified that he had
daily contact with Applicant. He reviewed Applicant’s SOR two weeks before the hearing.
Supervisor currently holds a TS/SCI security clearance. He has held a security clearance
since  2002  as  a  military  service  member,  government  service  employee,  and  defense
contractor. He has no concerns with Applicant’s behavior at work, and he has only seen
“nothing but reasonable, honorable behavior in the years” that he has known him. (Tr. 20-
28)
Applicant no longer associates with individuals who use drugs. (AE A; Tr. 31, 33,
52-53) He accepts full responsibility and the consequences for his prior actions, which
reflect “very poor judgment and a lack of understanding and respect [for] the severity of
holding a [security] clearance.” Applicant signed a statement acknowledging that future
drug use would subject his security clearance to revocation. He does not intend to use
drugs in the future. (GE 3 at 2; AE A; Tr. 29, 31, 33, 52-53)
Applicant currently volunteers at a bicycle co-op providing teaching and mentoring
for an under-privileged local community. He volunteered from 2006 to 2013 in another
state  with  the  Park  Rangers  at  a  National  Monument.  He  went  through  a  background
investigation  and  a  drug  test  for  this  work.  Since  August  2019,  Applicant  has  sought
weekly mental-health treatment to address stress, personal insight, and communication
skills. (AE A; AE B; Tr. 17-18, 35-36)
