In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  37-year-old  engineering  technician  employed  by  a  defense
contractor  since  December  2017.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from
September  2005  to  September  2013  and  was  discharged  under  the  Navy  high-tenure
rules for failure to be promoted. He began working for a defense contractor immediately
after  he  was  discharged.  He  was  employed  by  various  defense  contractors  and  non-
government employers from September 2013 until he was hired for his current position.
He  was  voluntarily  unemployed  from  May  2014  to  August  2015,  September  2016  to
August 2017, and October to December 2017 to attend college. He was unemployed from
November 2015 to June 2016, after leaving his job at a gym because it “was getting rid
of the attendees.” (Tr. 31-33; GX 1 at 13-18.) He earned a bachelor’s degree from an art
institute in June 2017. His educational expenses were covered by the GI Bill. He held a
security clearance in the Navy and retained it as an employee of a federal contractor.
Applicant  married  in  July  2004  and  divorced  in  October  2012.  He  remarried  in
January 2013. He has two children from his first marriage, ages seven and four, and a
three-year-old child from his current marriage. His oldest child lives with her mother, and
he pays child support for her. His two youngest children live with him and his current wife.
(Tr. 25.)
The SOR alleges seven delinquent debts totaling about $34,400 that are reflected
in  credit  reports  from  January  2018  and  February  2019.  (GX  2  and  3.)  The  evidence
concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: child support arrearage placed for collection of $22,636. Applicant
fell  behind  in  his  child-support  payments  during  his  periods  of  unemployment.  Since
January 2017, he has been paying $600 per month by direct deduction from his pay. The
last payment was on December 4, 2019. (AX A.)
SOR ¶ 1.b: deficiency of $14,562 after vehicle repossession. Applicant testified
that his vehicle was repossessed after he missed one or two payments. (Tr. 21.) He paid
about $900 to redeem the vehicle. He testified that his payments are current. (Tr. 54-57.)
He  believes  that  he  still  owes  about  $10,000  on  the  vehicle  loan.  (Tr.  79.)  He  did  not
provide any documentary evidence to support his testimony.  The February 2019 credit
report reflects that the account is still delinquent. (GX 3 at 2.)
SOR ¶ 1.c: secured loan charged off for $725. Applicant testified he incurred
this debt to repair the transmission in his wife’s car. (Tr. 58.) He testified that he has saved
up about $200 to pay this debt and is hoping to settle it for less than the full amount. (Tr.
20, 22.) He received an offer to settle the debt for about $300, but his wife advised him to
not accept the offer and wait for a better offer, and he followed her advice. (Tr. 58-59.)
The debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶¶  1.d-1.g:  medical  bills  placed  for  collection  of  $207,  $231,  $95,  and
$67. Applicant admitted these debts in his answer to the SOR, but he testified that he
does not know anything about them. (Tr. 19, 64.) He has not attempted to contact the
creditors or the collection agencies. (Tr. 86.) He has not disputed any of the debts. They
are not resolved.
Applicant sought and received financial counseling while he was in the Navy. He
also received financial advice from his mother, who worked in the banking industry. (Tr.
67.)
Applicant testified his gross annual income is about $52,000. (Tr. 29.) He and his
wife  currently  have  a  net  remainder of  about  $300  after paying  all  expenses.  (Tr. 70.)
About two weeks before the hearing, Applicant and his wife traded in one of their older
cars and bought a 2016 used car, borrowing about $11,000 to finance the purchase. (Tr.
73-74.)
Applicant’s  wife  has  been  offered  a  job  in  another  state.  She  will  be  moving  in
December 2019, and he and the children will follow her in January 2020. He expects to
incur moving expenses and to maintain two residences until he joins his wife at her new
job location. (Tr. 20-21.) His wife’s annual pay for her new job will be about $52,000.
Applicant hopes to find employment in their new home state, but had not done so
as of the date the record closed. (Tr. 48-50.) He intends to remain in his current job until
he finds employment at his wife’s work location. (Tr. 82.)
