Applicant,  36,  has  been  employed  in  the  information  technology  field  (IT)  by
multiple  defense  contractors  since  2006.  He  has  completed  some  college  coursework
and  numerous  certification  programs  to  remain  current  with  technology.  He  has  a  13-
year-old son. He was granted his first security clearance in approximately 2009. (GX 1;
Tr. 19-20; GX 2.)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant:  failed to timely file his state
and federal tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b);
is indebted for two student loans totaling $4,309 totaling (SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.g); owes $312
for two medical debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j); and owes $16,215 for seven delinquent debts,
which  include  credit-card  and  utilities  accounts,  the  balance  due  for  a  repossessed
vehicle, and a personal loan (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f, and 1.k through 1.o.).
Applicant denies SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, stating that he has since filed his state and
federal  tax  returns.  He  denies  SOR  ¶¶  1.l,  1.m,  and  1.n  stating  that  they  are  paid.  He
admits  the  remaining  allegations,  stating  that  he  incurred  the  debts  due  to  financial
hardship and that has contacted the debtors in an effort to establish a repayment plan.
The  unfiled  tax  returns  are  reflected  in  Applicant’s  2017  e-QIP  and  his  May  2019
responses  to  interrogatories,  which  include  Applicant’s  certified  personal  subject
interviews (PSI) from 2018. The delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant’s May 2019
and  February  2018  credit  bureau  reports  (CBR).  (GX  4;  GX  3.)  His  admissions  are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant experienced financial hardship due to multiple periods of unemployment
which include October 2013 to February 2014; October 2016 until December 2016; May
2018 until January 2019; and May 2019 until the present. Since losing his most recent
employment, Applicant has been on numerous job interviews, but has been unsuccessful
in securing a position in the IT field. He has been denied several positions because of his
lack of experience in certain areas and/or because he does not currently hold a security
clearance. (GX 1; Tr. 30-34; AX I; Tr. 65-66.)
From  2006  until  2018,  Applicant  had  custody  of  his  son.  As  a  single  parent,
Applicant incurred expenses, including for medical care. He did not receive any financial
assistance from his son’s mother. During Applicant’s periods of unemployment, both he
and his son were uninsured. (Tr. 53.) His son currently lives with his mother, but Applicant
provides financial assistance for them. (Tr. 73.)
Applicant  bought  a  rental  property  in  2011.  The  house  needed  significant
restoration.  He  experienced  difficulties  in  the  restoration  due  to  unreliable  contractors,
and the process required a significant financial investment. He did not rent the property
until sometime in 2016 or 2017. (Tr. 60.) Applicant acquired a second rental property from
a family member. He used his money to fix it up, and has used the rental income to pay
the family member for the balance owed for the property. He owns both properties free
and clear. He began renting the second property in February 2019. The tenants in both
rental properties have a history of paying their rent late. However, both properties were
rented  and  paid  on  time  beginning  in  September  2019  for  a  total  of  $1,900.  This  is
currently Applicant’s sole source of income. He and his son do not currently have health
insurance. (Tr. 59-60; Tr. 69.)
Applicant  did  not  timely  file  his  2014  through  2018  federal and  state  tax  returns
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b). He testified that he was focused on caring for his son and trying to
make ends meet and simply did not file his taxes. During his 2018 PSI, he stated that he
did  not  file  his  2016  and  2017  tax  returns  because  he  knew  that  he  owed  money  and
could not afford to pay. (Tr. 23; GX 2.)
In April 2019, Applicant hired a tax preparer to prepare and file his returns. She
filed them in April 2019, but for unknown reasons, the Federal returns were not accepted
by  the  IRS.  Applicant  refiled  them  and  as of the  date  of  the  hearing,  his 2014  through
2016 and 2018 had been accepted by the IRS. Applicant’s W-2 for 2017 was inaccurate,
and the return for that year was rejected by the IRS. Applicant received a corrected W-2
from his employer, and resubmitted the 2017 electronically resubmitted the day before
the hearing. Applicant owes between $7,000 and $8,000 for delinquent Federal taxes and
approximately  $2,500  for  his  2016-2018  state  taxes.  It  is  unclear  what  his  state  tax
obligations were for 2014 and 2015. (GX 2; Tr. 70.) He has not made any effort to contact
the IRS or the state treasury to arrange a repayment plans. (Tr. 23-29.)
The $10,569 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d is the balance due for repossessed vehicle.
Applicant bought a vehicle for $32,000 in December 2011. He fell behind on his payments
in  November  2013  while  unemployed,  and  the  vehicle  was  repossessed  in  February
2014.  Applicant  immediately  contacted  the  creditor  and  offered  to  make  a  $6,000
payment, but the creditor demanded payment in full of the outstanding balance. Applicant
recently contacted the creditor in an effort to negotiate a repayment plan, but the creditor
demanded $400 upfront and $400 a month. Applicant was financially unable to commit to
such an agreement. (Tr. 36-38.) This debt remains unresolved.
Applicant has two delinquent student loan accounts of $3,941 and $368 (SOR ¶¶
1.e and 1.g) that were opened in 2005. He made payments in 2008, then had periods of
deferment  and  forbearance.  The  accounts  became  delinquent  in  2015.  Applicant
contacted the creditor and entered a repayment agreement on September 16, 2019, for
$85 a month for repayment of both accounts. He has made one payment. (AX C; Tr. 38-
39.)
On September 24, 2019, Applicant entered repayment agreements to pay $50 a
month on each of the following accounts: the $2,230 personal-loan account (SOR ¶ 1.f);
the $216 medial account (SOR ¶ 1.i and 1.j are duplicates); the $172 utility account (SOR
¶ 1.k); and the $1,400 credit-card account (SOR ¶ 1.o). He also made his first payment
on each account on that day.
Applicant paid the $362 cable bill and the $482 and $1,000 rent balances (SOR ¶¶
1.l, 1.m, and 1.n) in 2016. (AX H.) These debts are satisfied.
Applicant has made lifestyle adjustments in an effort to gain financial stability and
not incur any more debt. He liquidated his 401(k), he lives with his parents, and he does
not own a vehicle. He attempted to sell one of his rental properties, but was unable to do
so. He also attempted to take a loan using one of his rental properties as collateral, but
was unable to do so because he did not have a job. He experienced additional financial
strain when a tree fell and damaged one of his rental properties, and although  he had
insurance,  he  was  still  required  to  pay  some  of  the  repair  costs  out-of-pocket.  He  has
been  caught  in  a  vicious  cycle  of  financial  strain  due  to  unemployment.  Applicant  has
continued to gain certifications in the IT field to increase his hireability. It is his intention
to  repay  all  his  delinquent  accounts  including  his  tax  debts,  which  he  thinks  he  could
afford $75 to $100 per month in payments. He has approximately $500 in his checking
account.  (Tr.  57-64;  Tr.  28;  AX  J;  Tr.  71.)  He  was  credible  and  sincere  during  his
testimony.
