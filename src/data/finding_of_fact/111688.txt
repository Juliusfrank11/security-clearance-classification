Applicant  admitted  to  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.f.,  1.g.,  and  2a.~2.d.  She
denied SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.a.~1.e., and 1.h.~1.j. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  registered  nurse.  (TR  at  page  26  line  14  to  page  28
line  15, and  GX  1  at page  7.) She  is married  to  a member of  the  U.S.  Navy,  and  has
one  child.  (TR  at  page  16  line  17  to  page  18  line  3.)  As  they  are  deployed  in  Japan,
Applicant has had difficulties qualifying to work in her profession, which resulted in the
alleged financial difficulties.
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a.  Applicant  denies  that  she  had  her husband  failed  to  file  their  2013  Federal
income  tax  returns  in  a  timely  fashion.  They  incorrectly  thought  that,  as  they  were
deployed  overseas,  they  “had  some  kind  of  .  .  .  extension.”  (TR  at  page  21  line  25  to
page 24 line 11.) They in fact filed this return in September of 2014, five months late, as
evidenced  by  this  filing.  (AppXs  A,  B,  and  F  at  attch  A.)  I  find  that  Applicant  made  a
good-faith effort to comply with Federal tax law; and as such, this allegation is found for
Applicant.
1.b.    Applicant  denies  that  she  had  a  past-due  debt  to  a  cable  provider  in  the
amount of about $322. Applicant avers that she was unaware of this alleged debt until
she was interviewed by a special agent. (TR at page 24 line 12 to page 25 line 14.) Her
credibility is attested to by those who know Applicant in the work place. (AppX G.) This
debt  was  “settled  in  full”  in  July  of  2019,  as  evidenced  by  a  letter  from  this  creditor.
(AppX D.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.c.  Applicant denies that she had a past-due debt to a department store in the
amount of about $299. Applicant avers that she lost her wallet and was unaware of this
alleged  debt  until  she  was  interviewed  by  a  special  agent.  (TR  at  page  36  line  20  to
page  37  line  10.)  This  debt  “has  a  zero  balance,”  as  evidenced  by  a  letter  from  this
creditor. (AppX F at attch C.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.d.  and  1.e.  Applicant  denies  that  she  is  delinquent  on  her  student  loans  that
total about $16,922. Applicant is current with her student loans, with a current balance
of about $15,055. (TR at page 37 line 11 to page 38 line 7, at page 44 line 19 to page
46 line 16, and AppX F at attchs D and E.) These allegations are found for Applicant.
1.f.  Applicant  denies  that  she  had  a  past-due  credit  card  debt  in  the  amount  of
about $8,228. (TR at page 25 line 23 to page 26 line 14.) This debt was settled and has
a “$0.00” balance, as evidenced by documentation from this creditor. (AppX F at attch
F.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.g.  Applicant  denies  that  she  is  delinquent  on  another  student  loan  for  about
$11,817.  This  loan  is  settled  in  full  as  evidenced  by  documentation  regarding  this
student loan. (TR at page 38 lines 8 ~19, at page 41 line 21 to page 42 line 8, at page
46  line  18  to  page  47  line  17,  and  AppX  F  at  attch  G.)  This  allegation  is  found  for
Applicant.
1.h.  and  1.i.  Applicant  denies  that  she  had  past-due  credit  card  debts  totaling
about  $1,442.  (TR  at  page  40  lines  3~14.)  This  debt  was  settled  and  has  a  “$0.00”
balance, as evidenced by documentation from this creditor. (AppX F at attchs H and I.)
These allegations are found for Applicant.
1.j.  Applicant  denies  that  she  had  a  past-due  credit  card  debt  in  the  amount  of
about $715. (TR at page 38 line 8 to page 49 line 6.) This debt “has a zero balance,” as
evidenced by a letter from this creditor. (AppX F at attch J.) This allegation is found for
Applicant.
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
2.a. Applicant’s father-in-law is a dual national of the Philippines and the United
States,  and  resides  in  the  Philippines.  His  is  retired  and  has  no  connection  with  the
Philippine  government.  (TR  at  page  49  lines  6~21.)  This  allegation  is  found  for
Applicant.
2.b.  Applicant’s  two  older brothers are  citizens  and  residents  of the  Philippines.
One “drives a jeep,” and the other “owns a Gown Shop.” (TR at page 13 lines 4~10, and
at page 14 lines 10~20.) She has little contact with these brothers, once in 12 year. (TR
at page 15 line 16 to page 16 line 5.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
2.c. Applicant’s aunt is a citizen and resident of the   Philippines. She also owns
“a  Gown  Shop.”  (TR  at  page  15  lines  8~15,  and  at  page  16  lines  6~16.)  Applicant’s
contact with her aunt is infrequent, at best. This allegation is found for Applicant.
2.d.  Applicant  and  her  husband  own  “undeveloped”  property  in  the  Philippines
worth  about  $60,000.  They  are  unsure  what  they  will  do  with  this  property,  which  has
appreciated  little  since  its  purchase.    As  their  son  may  return  to  the  United  States  to
further his education once he reaches college age, they may sell this property and also
return to the United States. (TR at page 18 line 4 to page 21 line 9, at page 30 line 23 to
page 32 line 20, and at page 50 lines 20~25.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
Notice
I take administrative notice of the following facts: The Philippines is a multi-party,
constitutional  republic  with  a  bicameral  legislature.  There  is  considerable  risk  of
terrorism  in  Manila.  There  are  also  human  rights  issues  including  unlawful or  arbitrary
killings  by  security  forces,  vigilantes,  and  other  groups  allegedly  connected  to  the
government.
