In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f
and he denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h. His admissions in his answer and
at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 55-year-old test engineer employed by a defense contractor since
June  2015.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Marine  Corps  from  August  1984  to
August  1988  and  in  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  from  June  1991  to  June  2007,  when  he
retired. (Tr. 58-59.) He was employed by various federal contractors before being hired
for his current position. He had periods of unemployment from  January to March 2012
and  May  to  June  2015.  He  received  a  security  clearance  in  2003.  In  his  security
clearance  application,  he  disclosed  that  his  application  to  continue  his  clearance  was
denied by another federal agency in February 2016 based on financial considerations.
(GX 1 at 55-56.)
Applicant  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  June  1989  and  a  master’s  degree  in
May 2003. He married in September 1994 and has two children ages 21 and 18.
The  SOR  alleges  a  delinquent  home-mortgage  loan  (SOR  ¶  1.a);  three
delinquent credit card accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.d); a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition that
was  dismissed  (SOR ¶  1.e); failures  to  timely  file federal and  state  income  tax  returns
for tax years 2011 through 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.f); a federal tax debt of $90,000 for tax years
2011-2016 (SOR ¶ 1.g); and a state tax debt of $12,000 for tax years 2011-2016. The
evidence concerning the allegations in the SOR is summarized below:
SOR  ¶  1.a:  delinquent  home-mortgage  loan  for  $572,585,  foreclosed  in
2018. Applicant purchased this home in December 2011 for $525,000 at a foreclosure
sale,  and  financed  the  entire  purchase  with  a  loan  guaranteed  by  the  Department  of
Veterans  Affairs  (VA).  (GX  3  at  3.) When he  purchased this home,  his adjusted  gross
income was about $162,593, and his wife was not employed outside the home. (AX E at
1; Tr. 31.) He knew the house “wasn’t in the best of shape.” (Tr. 29.) After moving into
the house, he discovered major structural problems. He used credit cards in an effort to
finance the repairs. He was laid off in January 2012 and unemployed until March 2012.
His annual income was about $110,000 when he returned to work, and later reduced to
$90,000  when  his  company’s  contract  with  a  U.S.  Government  agency  was  protested
and  delayed  for  about  a  year.  (Tr.  30,  35.)  He  testified  that  the  loan  was  modified  at
least twice, but he still was unable to catch up on the payments. (Tr. 32.) He listed the
property  for sale  in  February  2018 and  quickly  received  an  offer, but  the  contract  was
never  consummated  because  the  prospective  buyer’s  home  inspector  determined  that
the  home  required  more  than  $100,000  in  structural  repairs.  (GX  2  at  4;  Tr.  37-37.)
Applicant has made no further payments on the mortgage loan, and the house remains
in a foreclosure status.
SOR ¶ 1.b: delinquent credit-card account charged off for $15,066. At some
time before October 26, 2019, Applicant made a payment arrangement for this debt, but
the  collection  agency  was  unable  to  process  the  scheduled  $100  payments  by
automatic debit for reasons not reflected in the record. Applicant testified that he made
one  payment  by  telephone.  (Tr.  117.)  The  collection  agency’s  records  reflected  a
balance of $14,976, indicating that about $90 had been paid. (AX C.) Applicant testified
that  he  had  no  reason  for  not  making  further  payments,  except  that  he  was
overwhelmed with his financial situation. (Tr. 119.) The debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.c:  delinquent  unsecured  loan  charged  off  for  $3,554.  Applicant
testified that he did not know why he stopped making payments on this debt. (Tr. 121.)
It is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.d:  line  of  credit  charged  off  for  $7,846.  This  debt  was  due  to
overdrafts  on  Applicant’s  bank  account.  He  has  not  taken  any  steps  to  resolve  it.  (Tr.
123-24.)
SOR  ¶  1.e:  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  petition  filed  in  March  2017  and
dismissed on January 9, 2018. Applicant completed the required financial counseling
and made several payments to the bankruptcy trustee before the petition was dismissed
on motion of the IRS, apparently because of Applicant’s failures to timely file his federal
income tax returns, alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f. (GX 5 at 8-9; Tr. 124-26.)
SOR ¶ 1.f: failures to timely file federal and state income tax returns for tax
years  2011-2016.  Applicant  attributed  his  failure  to  timely  file  his  tax  returns  to
procrastination.  He  did  not  request  extensions  of  time  to  file.  He  erroneously  believed
that he did not owe any taxes and that his failures to timely file were “no big deal.” He
did not file his tax returns until his bankruptcy attorney told him that he needed to file all
his returns before filing the bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 97.) His federal income tax returns
for 2011-2015 were all signed on September 29, 2016, and his 2016 federal return was
signed on March 30, 2017. His state income tax returns for 2011-2015 were all signed
on March 29, 2017. (AX E.) He did not file state income tax returns for 2016-2018, but
the  state  tax  authority  informed  him  that  it  had  generated  substitute  returns  and
computed  his  state  taxes  based  on  his  federal  returns.  (AX  L.)  He  did  not  submit
documentary proof that the returns  in AX E were filed and received by the appropriate
tax  authorities,  but  he  did  submit  copy  of  an  email  exchange  with  his  bankruptcy
attorney  on  December  20,  2016,  in  which  he  indicated  that  he  had  a  certified  mail
receipt showing that the returns had been mailed. (AX K.)
SOR  ¶  1.g:  delinquent  federal  income  tax  debt  for  $90,000  for  tax  years
2011-2016.  In  March  2019,  Applicant  entered  into  a  payment  agreement  with  the  IRS
providing  for  monthly  payments  of  $661,  to  be  paid  by  automatic  withdrawal  from  his
bank account. (AX A.) He submitted evidence that the required payments were made in
August, September, October, and November 2019. (AX B at 1; AX I.) He also submitted
evidence  reflecting  that  his  total  debt  for  federal  income  taxes  was  $37,158,  broken
down as follows: $8,846 for 2011; $6,496 for 2012; $12,044 for 2013; $3,490 for 2015;
and $6,282 for 2018. (AX B at 2-3.)
SOR ¶ 1.h: delinquent state income tax debt of $12,000 for tax years 2011-
2016.  In  Applicant’s  security  clearance  application,  he  stated  that  he  was  paying  the
state  $1,000  per  month.  (GX  1  at  50-51.)  However,  he  has  not  provided  any
documentation  of  payments.  In  December  2019,  he  made  a  payment  agreement  with
the  state  tax  authority  to  resolve  a  balance  of  $4,176  in  24  monthly  installments,  with
the first payment due in January 2020, after the record closed. (AX J; AX L at 2.)
In  October  2019,  Applicant  and  his  wife  moved  into  a  modest  apartment  for
which they are paying rent of $1,652. (AX D.) His wife has returned to the workforce and
earns about $2,000 per month. (Tr. 137.) He estimates that they now have about $1,500
to  $2,000  per  month  in  disposable  income  that  can  be  used  for  debt  repayment.  (Tr.
144.)
