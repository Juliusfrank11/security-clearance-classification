Applicant  admitted  all  SOR  allegations  with  explanations.  His  admissions  are
incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I
make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
this contractor as an engineer for approximately two and a half years. Before his current
position, he owned a small business for 18 years, which provided software support. He
has a bachelor’s degree. He has been married twice previously. His first marriage was
from  1997  to  2010  and  his  second  marriage  was  from  2011  to  2015.  He  currently
resides with his girlfriend who he has seen since 2015. He has four children. (Tr. 7, 19-
20, 22-25, 51; GE 1)
The SOR alleged Applicant had a foreclosed-mortgage account in the amount of
approximately  $70,155;  five  past-due  medical  accounts  totaling  approximately  $1,476;
and  one  collection  account  totaling  $978.  The  debts  were  listed  in  credit  reports  from
September  2017  and  November  2018.  Credit  reports  from  June  2019  and  December
2019 show no delinquent debts, except for the foreclosure. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.g). (GE 3-5,
8)
Applicant credibly explained that the large mortgage debt was incurred during his
first marriage when he and his first wife purchased a house. When the two divorced in
2010,  his  ex-wife  was  awarded  the  house,  which  apparently  had  increased  in  equity
during  their  marriage.  His  ex-wife  was  ordered  to  refinance  the  property  and  pay
Applicant  his  share  of  the  equity.  She  failed  to  do  so.  In  December  2010,  Applicant
executed  a  warranty  deed  in  favor  of  his  ex-wife.  His  action  relieved  him  of  any
ownership  rights  to  the  property.  At  that  point,  he  believed  his  financial  responsibility
regarding  this  property  was  over.  He  provided  documentation  showing  the  executed
warranty  deed  that  was  filed  in  February  2012.  This  is  the  same  property  that  was
foreclosed in 2016. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 18-20, 31-33; GE 6-7; AE A)
Applicant incurred his medical debts (except for SOR ¶ 1.e, which was a dental
debt) as a result of his type 1 diabetes. The expenses were largely related to acquiring
medical  equipment  for  the  treatment  of  his  diabetes.  He  fell  behind  with  his payments
because his girlfriend was diagnosed with cancer and he began assisting her with those
expenses.  He  worked  out  a  verbal  agreement  with  his  medical  creditor  (the  same
company that supplies his diabetes equipment) and is on a repayment schedule where
he  is  paying  $25  monthly,  or  more  when  he  is  able.  He  documented  making  four  $50
payments from August through November 2019. The debts do not appear on his latest
credit report. These debts are being resolved. (Tr. 37-39; GE 8; AE D)
The dental debt that went to collection was caused by a mistake. Payment for the
service  was  to  be  taken  out  of  Applicant’s  paycheck,  but  that  did  not  occur.  The  debt
was  ultimately  paid  through  a  garnishment  action  in  December  2019.  This  debt  is
resolved. (Tr. 41; AE E)
Applicant  has  not  incurred  any  additional  delinquent  debts.  He  is  expecting  a
salary  raise  of  approximately  $22,000  this  coming  year  and  his  current  salary  is
approximately $104,000 (with overtime). He has not sought financial counseling, but he
and  his  girlfriend  utilize  a  monthly  budget.  He  documented  contributing  more  funds  to
his  health  savings  account  so  that  he  will  not  incur  high  out-of-pocket  medical  costs
without  a  payment  source.  Applicant  provided  two  years’  worth  of  work  appraisals,
which reflect that he has “met expectations.” (Tr. 28, 42; AE C, F)
