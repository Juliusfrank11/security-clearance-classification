In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b,
1.c,  1.f,  1.g,  and  1.h.  He  also  provided  extenuating  and  mitigating  information.  His
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 39-year-old director of operations. (Item 3) In 1998, he graduated
from high school, and in 2003, he graduated from college with a bachelor’s degree. (Id.)
In  2005,  he  received  a  master’s  degree.  (Id.)  He  has  no  military  service.  (Id.)  He  was
married from 1999 to 2004, and he married again in 2010. (Id.) His three children were
born in 1997, 2004, and 2015. (Id.)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s SCA shows no periods of unemployment after August 2011. (Item 3)
He also disclosed several financial issues in his SCA. (Id.) He said he inherited debt after
his father-in-law died, and he fell behind on some of his own debts. (Id.) Most of his debts
were generated through student loans. He received some financial counseling services
from his bank. (Id.) For his student loans, he said the financial issue began in May 2014,
and he was seeking repayment options. (Id.)
The  SOR  alleges  eight  delinquent  debts  totaling  $112,242,  as  follows:  1.a,  1.b,
and 1.c are three student loans placed for collection for $50,337, $38,006, and $5,220;
1.d is a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $3,431; 1.e is an account placed
for collection for $2,245; 1.f and 1.g are two charged-off debts for $515 and $488; and
1.h is a debt relating to a corporate credit card for $12,000. (Item 1)
In his March 29, 2018 SCA, Applicant said he owed about $12,000 on a corporate
credit  card  because  he  failed  “to  maintain  payments  within  established  timeframe  for
corporate sponsored credit card.” (Item 3) During his Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), he clarified that he went on two business trips
that were subsequently not approved, and his employer refused to reimburse his costs.
(Item  6)  In  response  to  the  denial  of  reimbursement,  he  authorized  a  $1,000  monthly
voluntary garnishment from his paycheck until the debt was paid in full. (Item 3; Item 6)
On May 16, 2019, he said the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h was paid in full. (Item 2) He is credited
with resolving the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h.
In his May 16, 2019 SOR response, Applicant said he was paying the student loans
in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c through wage garnishment. (Item 2) He said he planned to
settle the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g. (Id.)
Applicant said he was contesting the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e. The debt in
SOR  ¶  1.d  was  invalid  because  the  telecommunications  company  stopped  providing
cellular service where Applicant lived, and the telecommunications company said his plan
would  be  cancelled  without  penalty.  (Item  2)  Nevertheless,  the  telecommunications
company billed Applicant for $3,431. (Id.) He did not explain why he contested the debt
in SOR ¶ 1.e for $2,245; however, he believed it would be removed from his credit report.
(Id.)
In  the  FORM,  Department  Counsel  noted  the  absence  of  corroborating  or
supporting  documentation  of  resolution  of  the  SOR  debts.  Aside  from  Applicant’s
uncorroborated  statements,  there  is  no  documentary  evidence  that  Applicant  paid,
arranged to pay, settled, compromised, or otherwise resolved any of the SOR debts. The
record  lacks  corroborating  or  substantiating  documentation  and  other  mitigating
information. The FORM informed Applicant that he had 30 days from the receipt of the
FORM  “in  which  to  submit  a  documentary  response  setting  forth  objections,
rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as appropriate. If you do not file any
objections  or  submit  any  additional  information  .  .  .  your  case  will  be  assigned  to  an
Administrative Judge for a determination based solely” on the evidence set forth in this
FORM. (FORM at 4 (emphasis in original)) He did not respond to the FORM.
