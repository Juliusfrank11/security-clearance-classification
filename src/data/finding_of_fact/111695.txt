Applicant  is  a  45-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance. (Tr. 5-6) He is employed as a senior systems engineer for a large company
in  the  defense  industry.  He  began  working  for  this  company  in  October  2018.  (Tr. 36)
He referred to it as his “career job” and “dream job.” (Tr. 77) His gross annual salary is
about $100,000 ($8,346 monthly) as of December 2019. (Exhibit E) He has a reputation
as  a  good  employee  per  letters  of  recommendation  from  two  co-workers.  (Exhibits  B
and C) His educational background includes a bachelor’s degree in engineering physics
and a master’s degree in organizational leadership. He married in 2007 and divorced in
2015.  He  married  his  current  spouse  in  2018.  He  has  two  adult  children,  daughters,
ages 22 and 21, born from other relationships.
The  SOR  concerns  a  history  of  financial  problems  or  difficulties.  It  includes
unresolved  federal  income-tax  matters,  child-support  arrearages,  a  delinquent  student
loan,  and  delinquent  consumer  accounts.  He  attributes  his  financial  problems  to
hardship  caused  by  irregular  employment,  to  include  periods  of  unemployment  and
underemployment. (Tr. 33-36) He attributes his income-tax problems to negligence. (Tr.
33)  A  review  of  Applicant’s  employment  history  follows  below  and  is  based  on
information he provided in his security clearance application. (Exhibit 1)
Applicant  worked  as  a  systems  engineer  for  an  aerospace  company  in  State  T
from February 2004 to October 2010, when he was laid off due to the end of a particular
high-profile program. He was then unemployed for a few months before he accepted a
job as an analyst for a healthcare company. He worked there from January 2011 to April
2011,  when  he  left  to  pursue  a  master’s  degree  in  State  P.  He  was  unemployed  and
collected unemployment compensation from April 2011 to October 2011  in State P. He
lived with his parents and worked as a graduate assistant during the master’s program
from October 2011 to June 2013. He completed the necessary course work, but had yet
to receive a degree as of September 2017. (Exhibit 1 at 12) His master’s thesis was in
revision  and  being  reviewed  by  the  university,  although  he  expected  to  receive  the
degree in December 2017.
After departing the university, Applicant worked as a part-time retail associate for
a couple of months from June 2013 to August 2013, while still living in State P. He left
that job to relocate to State T to look for work. He was unemployed from August 2013 to
January 2014, when he began working as a full-time teacher for a public school district.
He had the teaching job until December 2015, when he returned to State P and moved
in  with  his  parents,  as  he  was  then  undergoing  difficult  personal  circumstances,
including  a  divorce.  He  was  unemployed  from  December  2015  to  October  2016.  He
worked  on  his master’s  thesis during  this  time.  In  about  October 2016,  he  returned  to
State T for a job as a part-time substitute teacher for a staffing company. He had that
job in State T until he began his current employment in the defense industry in October
2018, which is located in State A.
a.  Federal Income-Tax Matters
In four separate allegations, the SOR concerns two federal tax liens, filed in June
2011 and September 2011, in the amounts of $22,783 and $22,806, respectively; failure
to  timely  file,  as  required,  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2008-2017;  and
$14,536  in  back  taxes  owed  to  the  IRS  for  tax  year  2008.  Applicant  admitted  the  four
SOR  allegations  in  his  written  answer.  His  history  of  tax  problems  is  long-standing,
going  back  to  at  least  tax  year  2006,  as  shown  by  the  documentary  evidence.  It  also
appears the back taxes for 2008 are included in one or both of the federal tax liens, and
so the allegation will be decided for Applicant on the basis of the same conduct being
alleged twice.
To address the federal income-tax matters, Applicant initially hired an accountant
to prepare returns and then retained the services of a tax-relief company in April 2019.
(Exhibit A) As Applicant explained, he paid an initial investigation fee of $495 and pays
the company a month fee of $864, and the matter was pending or under review with the
company. (Tr. 38-40) A review of available IRS records—which does not include copies
of the tax liens—and credit reports follows below.
The  June  2011 federal tax  lien for $22,783  is  not  reflected  in the October 2017
credit  report.  (Exhibit  8)  It  is  reflected  in  Applicant’s  IRS  Account  Transcripts  for  tax
years  2006-2008,  although  the  dollar  amount  is  not  reflected.  (Exhibits  F,  G,  and  H).
The lien is not reflected in the more recent credit reports from 2018 and 2019. (Exhibits
9, 10, and 11)
The September 2011 federal tax lien for $22,806 is reflected in the October 2017
credit  report.  (Exhibit  8)  It  is  not  reflected  in  the  credit  reports  from  2018  and  2019.
(Exhibits 8-11) The lien is reflected in the IRS Account Transcripts for tax years 2006-
2008, although the dollar amount is not reflected. (Exhibits F, G, and H)
Because  copies  of  the  tax  liens  are  not  in  evidence,  it  is  unknown  which  tax
years the liens apply. It is certainly  possible the two federal tax liens are for the same
tax years, the second lien filed to reflect an increase in the amount of back taxes owed.
Concerning the failure to file and back taxes,  a review of IRS documentation for
13 tax years covering 2006-2018 shows the following: (1) Applicant failed to timely file a
tax return for 11 of the 13 tax years; (2) returns have now been filed for 7 of the 13 tax
years; and (3) he owes approximately $29,000 in back taxes for tax years 2006-2008 for
which he has yet to make a payment arrangement with the IRS. Details are discussed
below.  In  making  the  findings  below,  I  have  relied  on  the  IRS  Account  Transcripts
because, in my view, they are the best evidence of a taxpayer’s status with the IRS.
For tax year 2006, the IRS Account Transcript, dated May 30, 2019, reflects  an
account  balance  of  $2,436,  which  includes  $1,081  in  accrued  interest  and  $54  in
accrued penalty. (Exhibit F) The transcript also reflects that an extension of time to file a
tax return on October 15, 2007, was made on April 15, 2007; inquiry and notice for non-
filing were issued in 2008; a substitute tax return was prepared by the IRS in April 2010;
a tax return was secured in November 2010; and a collection notice was issued in 2011
before the filing of the first tax lien.
For tax year 2007, the IRS Account Transcript, dated May 30, 2019, reflects an
account  balance  of  $12,412,  which  includes  $3,182  in  accrued  interest  and  $499  in
accrued penalty. (Exhibit G). The transcript also reflects that an extension of time to file
a  tax  return  on  October  15,  2008,  was  made  on  April  15,  2008;  inquiry  and  notice  for
non-filing were issued in 2009; a substitute tax return was prepared by the IRS in April
2010; a tax return was secured in November 2010; and a collection notice was issued in
2011 before the filing of the first tax lien.
For tax year 2008, the IRS Account Transcript, dated May 30, 2019, reflects an
account  balance  of  $14,521,  which  includes  $3,530  in  accrued  interest  and  $895  in
accrued penalty. (Exhibit H) The transcript also reflects that an extension of time to file a
tax return on October 15, 2009, was made on April 15, 2009; inquiry and notice for non-
filing were issued in 2010; a substitute tax return was prepared by the IRS in July 2010;
a  tax  return  was  secured  in  March  2011;  and  a  collection  notice  was  issued  in  2011
before the filing of the first tax lien.
For tax year 2009, an IRS Account Transcript is not available.
For tax year 2010, the IRS Account Transcript, dated June 14, 2019, reflects an
account  balance  of  $0.  (Exhibit  6)  The  transcript  also  reflects  that  no  tax  return  was
filed; inquiry and notice for non-filing were issued in 2011; and a tax return was secured
in June 2019.
For tax year 2011, the IRS Account Transcript, dated June 14, 2019, reflects an
account  balance  of  $0.  (Exhibit  6)  The  transcript  also  reflects  that  no  tax  return  was
filed.
For tax year 2012, the IRS Account Transcript, dated June 14, 2019, reflects an
account of $0. (Exhibit 6) The transcript also reflects that no tax return was filed and that
the IRS issued a letter to Applicant’s then employer to limit withholding allowance.
For tax year 2013, the IRS Account Transcript, dated June 14, 2019, reflects an
account  balance  of  $0.  (Exhibit  6)  The  transcript  also  reflects  that  no  tax  return  was
filed.
For tax year 2014, the IRS Account Transcript, dated June 14, 2019, reflects an
account  balance  of  $0.  (Exhibit  6)  The  transcript  also  reflects  that  no  tax  return  was
filed;  inquiry  and  notice  for  non-filing  were  issued  in  2016  and  2017;  and  a  tax  return
was secured in June 2019.
For tax year 2015, the IRS Account Transcript, dated June 14, 2019, reflects an
account  balance  of  $0.  (Exhibit  6)  The  transcript  also  reflects  that  no  tax  return  was
filed, although an extension of time to file the return on October 15, 2016, was made on
April 15, 2016.
For tax year 2016, the IRS Account Transcript, dated June 14, 2019, reflects an
account balance of $0. (Exhibit 6) The transcript also reflects that a tax return was filed
on June 10, 2019.
For tax year 2017, the IRS Account Transcript, dated June 14, 2019, reflects an
account  balance  of  $0.  (Exhibit  6)  The  transcript  also  reflects  that  no  tax  return  was
filed.
For tax  year 2018,  the  most  recent tax  year,  the  IRS  Record  of  Account,  dated
May  30,  2019,  reflects  Applicant  timely  filed  his  federal  income  return  on  March  25,
2019.  (Exhibit  O)  A  credit  of  $1,340  was  transferred  and  applied  to  tax  year  2003.  A
credit of $1,715 was transferred and applied to tax year 2006.
At hearing, Applicant claimed his federal income tax  returns for tax years 2008-
2017 were filed by the tax-relief company. (Tr. 45-49) I informed him I could not accept
his representation without documentation, ideally from the IRS, given that the available
documentation  from  the  IRS  (e.g.,  Exhibit  6)  indicated  he  had  not  filed  for  multiple
years. The record was left open for Applicant to provide such documentation.
b.  State Tax Lien for $3,291
The SOR concerns a debt owed to State P based on a tax lien filed in February
2006 for $3,291. The state tax lien is reflected in a credit report from November 2007.
(Exhibit  7) It  is not  reflected  in  more  recent credit  reports from  2017,  2018,  and  2019.
(Exhibits  8-11)  As  a  result,  it  was  not  discussed  during  his  2017  background
investigation. (Exhibit 2) Applicant denied this debt in his answer to the SOR, explaining
that  he  thinks  it  stems  from  a  job  layoff  in  1999  when  he  received  unemployment
compensation  and  the  state  wanted  to  recoup  an  overpayment.  Applicant  had  no
documentation on the matter.
c.  Child-Support Arrearages
The  SOR  concerns  a  single  allegation  that  Applicant  is  indebted  for  past-due
child-support  payments  to  a  state  child-support  office  in  the  amount  of  $25,529.
Applicant admitted the allegation in his answer to the SOR, explaining it related to one
of  his  daughters  who  was  born  to  a  mother  who  was  receiving  public  assistance.  He
explained that he owes arrears for child support for both daughters.
A  past-due  account  for  child  support  for  $5,445  is  reflected  in  a  2007  credit
report. (Exhibit 7) Two past-due accounts for child support for $19,968 and $11,691 are
reflected  in  the  2017  credit  report.  (Exhibit  8)  A  past-due  account  for  child  support for
$25,529 is reflected in the 2018 credit report. (Exhibit 9) Two accounts for child support,
one past due for $21,625 and the other current, are reflected in the August 2019 credit
report.  (Exhibit  10)  The  current  account  has  a  balance  of  $4,131.  Three  accounts  for
child support, two past due and the other current, are reflected in the credit report from
November 2019. (Exhibit 11) The two past-due accounts are for $21,615 and $21,625.
The current account has a balance of $2,839.
The  creditors  are  still  trying  to  collect  the  child-support  arrears.  Once  Applicant
started working for his current employer, the creditors notified his employer to withhold
money for child-support payments pursuant to wage garnishments. (Exhibit 3) Applicant
had no documentation on the child-support arrearages, and the matters are considered
unresolved.
d.  Delinquent Student Loan Account
The SOR concerns a delinquent student loan account with a past-due balance of
$5,071  with  a  balance  of  $27,628.  Applicant  explained  the  student  loan  was  for  his
undergraduate  degree,  which  he  completed  in  1998,  and  he  fell  behind  on  payments
due to his irregular employment. The past-due loan is reflected as stated in the SOR in
the  October  2017  credit  report.  (Exhibit  8)  It  is  not  reflected  in  the  2018  credit  report.
(Exhibit 9) It is reflected in the credit reports from 2019 with a $0 account balance, but it
also shows that the account was transferred/sold. (Exhibits 10 and 11)
The  creditor  is  still  trying  to  collect  the  past-due  student  loan.  Once  Applicant
started working for his current employer, the creditor notified his employer that he was
subject  to  wage  garnishment  due  to  a  student  loan  in  the  amount  of  15%  monthly  to
satisfy a $57,606 debt. (Exhibit 3) Applicant had no documentation on the student loan,
and the matter is considered unresolved.
e.  Collection Accounts
The SOR also concerns six collection accounts in amounts ranging from $203 to
$2,712  for  a  total  of  $6,528.  The  debts  stem  from  an  apartment  lease,  consumer
accounts, and medical collection accounts. Applicant had no documentation for any of
the six collection accounts, and the matters are considered unresolved.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been

Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;
AG ¶ 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local
income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income
tax as required;
AG  ¶  20(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  a  death,  divorce,  or
separation,  clear  victimization  by  predatory  lending  practices,  or  identity
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort
to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and
6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶¶ E3.1.14 and E3.1.15.
AG ¶ 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax
authority  to  file  or  pay  the  amount  owed  and  is  in  compliance  with  those
arrangements.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.  The
disqualifying conditions noted above apply here.
Applicant has made very little progress in resolving his extensive list of financial
problems. He has taken the first step or two toward addressing his long-standing federal
income-tax  matters,  but  retention  of  the  tax-relief  company  has  yet  to  yield  any  fruit.
Time  will  tell  on  that  front.  The  other  matters  are  unresolved.  Nevertheless,  I  am  no
longer concerned about the state tax lien for $3,291. Given that the lien dates back to
2006, and that it no longer appears in current credit reports, it is probable that the lien
expired or self-released and is no longer on the books. It is mitigated by the passage of
time and its non-appearance in recent credit reports.
In addition, I note that an applicant’s failure to timely file tax returns and pay tax
when  due  bears  close  examination  and  is  a  matter  of  serious  concern  to  the  federal
government.  The  DOHA  Appeal  Board  has  made  it  clear  that  an  applicant  who  fails
repeatedly to fulfill their legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying tax when
due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of
those granted access to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 15-06707 at 3 (App.
Bd. Aug. 15, 2017).
Here,  I  am  concerned  about  the  duration  of  Applicant’s  federal  income-tax
problems and the timing of his remedial action. Both are questions of fact that must be
addressed. His tax problems date back to 2006 and continued through 2017, a period of
more  than  ten  years.  His  remedial  actions  date  to  2019,  when  he  retained  an
accountant  and  then  the  tax-relief  firm  to  assist  him.  It’s  possible  that  the  only  reason
Applicant is addressing his tax problems is that the matters were brought to the forefront
during  the  security  clearance  process.  He  admits  he  was  negligent  concerning  his
federal income-tax obligations, and that is mildly expressed. His negligent disregard of
his  federal  income-tax  obligations  demonstrates  unreliability,  untrustworthiness,  and
lack of good judgment. It is a disqualifying characteristic for those who seek eligibility for
access to classified information.
In mitigation, Applicant disclosed his federal income-tax problems in his security
clearance  application.  He  also  provided  additional  information  during  the  security
clearance  process.
I  also  considered  his  periods  of  unemployment  and
underemployment during 2010-2019, the multiple relocations, and the divorce in 2015.
Those  life  events  often  create  difficult  and  challenging  circumstances.  Concerning  his
employment  history,  I  note  that  he  went  many  years  between  good-paying  jobs,  from
the  layoff  in  October  2010  until  he  began  his  current  job  in  October  2018.  Obviously,
those circumstances hindered his ability to repay past-due accounts. But I also note that
Applicant’s  back  taxes  were  incurred  for  tax  years  2006-2008  before  the  job  layoff  in
2010. In other words, this is a long-standing problem for Applicant.
Applicant is now in the beginning stages of addressing the tax matters while the
other  matters  remain  unresolved.  In  that  respect,  he  has  not  acted  responsibly  under
the circumstances. He owes a sizeable sum in back taxes to the IRS, at least $29,000
for tax years 2006-2008 per IRS Account Transcripts; he owes more than $50,000 on a
delinquent  student  loan;  and  he  owes  at  least  $20,000  (if  not  more  than  $40,000)  in
child-support  arrears.  That
financially
overextended  now  and  for the foreseeable future.  Considering  the  totality  of facts  and
circumstances,  Applicant  has  not  presented  sufficient  evidence  of  reform  and
rehabilitation.  Accordingly,  none  of  the  mitigating  conditions  noted  above  apply  in
Applicant’s favor.
indebtedness  suggests  he

is
Following Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to  protect
classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence
as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he
has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with
the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
