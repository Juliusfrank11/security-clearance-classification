In her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, four of the
SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c., and 1.i.).
Applicant’s  comments  with  respect  to  both  her  admissions  and  her  denials  are
incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record,
and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving
as a material analyst with her current employer since January 2012, and before that she
was  a  material  production  coordinator  with  the  same  employer  during  two  separate
periods  essentially  going  back  to  2003.  She  is  a  1987  high  school  graduate.  She  has
never served with the U.S. military, and she has never held a security clearance. She was
married in 1990, and she has four children, born in 1991, 1999, 2002, and 2004.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can  be  found  in  the  following  exhibits:  Item  7  (Combined  Experian,  TransUnion,  and
Equifax  Credit  Report,  dated  June  14,  2017);  Item  5  (Equifax  Credit  Report,  dated
February 7, 2019); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated October 3, 2019); Item 3 (SF 86,
dated January 26, 2017); Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated July 10, 2018); and
Item 2 (Applicant’s Answers to SOR, dated May 15, 2019).
Applicant reported that she was unemployed from November 2007, when she was
laid off, until August 2008. During that period she received unemployment compensation.
(Item 3, at 13-14) She did not attribute her financial problems to any specific factors.
In her January 2017 SF 86, Applicant listed having only one delinquent account
which she claimed had arisen as a result of a motor vehicle accident in March 2015 when
the
insurance  company  denied  coverage.  She  denied  having  any  additional
delinquencies. (Item 3, at 32-33)
In  July  2018,  during  an  interview  with  an  investigator  from  the  U.S.  Office  of
Personnel Management  (OPM),  Applicant  acknowledged  that,  in  early  2015  when  she
obtained a credit report and learned that she had several other delinquent accounts, she
started  working  with  a  credit  counseling  service.  She  added  that  she  had  engaged  a
particular law firm that specializes in debt relief to negotiate payments with her creditors
and provide her credit assistance. She contended that she pays the firm $200 every pay
day for their services. She described her overall financial situation as “better.” She stated
that the majority of her delinquent accounts were in the negotiation process, some were
being paid, and others had already been paid off. (Item 4)
The OPM investigator offered Applicant the opportunity to furnish documentation
regarding the accounts, and she provided 15 pages of financial documents, not otherwise
described, that were sent to “document control” on July 12, 2018. (Item 4, at 5) No such
documents were included in the case file submitted to me. Accordingly, it is not known if
those documents included the engagement agreement with the law firm; the terms of the
credit counseling services or negotiation services furnished by the law firm; or cancelled
checks or receipts supporting payments to the law firm or to various creditors. Because
the  OPM  investigator  acknowledged  receiving  those  financial  documents,  and  the
government failed to produce them, I have given Applicant the benefit of the doubt and
concluded that she had furnished documentation that was material and relevant to the
allegations in the SOR.
The SOR alleged nine delinquent accounts totaling approximately $24,176, as set
forth as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a. is a jointly-held automobile loan with an unpaid balance of $19,208 that
was charged off in December 2015 and sold to another company. Applicant disputed the
account status with the credit reporting company. (Item 7, at 6, 10; Item 5, at 1-2; Item 6,
at 1; Item 3, at 32-33; Item 2; Letter from collection agent, dated August 5 or 6, 2017,
attached  to  Response  to  the  FORM)  Applicant  acknowledged  that  her  husband  had
cancelled his insurance coverage with one company to take advantage of lower prices
with another company, but he failed to comply with the requirement that the vehicle be
inspected, and when it was involved in an accident and totaled, both insurance companies
rejected his claim. (Item 3, at 32-33) In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the
allegation,  and  she  claimed  that  the  creditor  or  collection  agent  had  refused  any
settlement other than a full payment on the unpaid balance. The account is not yet in the
process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b. is a charge account with an unpaid balance of $699 that was charged
off  and  sold  to  another  company.  (Item  7,  at  7;  Item  5,  at  2;  Item  6,  at  3) The  unpaid
balance eventually increased to $1,133. Applicant initially claimed that she had attempted
to pay the creditor but was unable to do so because the account had been charged off
due to a hurricane, so she never made another attempt. (Item 2) On November 29, 2019,
eight months after the SOR was issued, Applicant made a $50 payment to the collection
agent. (Account Summary from collection agent, dated November 29, 2019, attached to
Response to the FORM) Applicant failed to produce any evidence that other more recent
payments have been made. The account is in the very early process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c. is a charge account with an unpaid balance of $883 that was charged
off.  The  last  payment  was  made  in  March  2018.  (Item  5,  at  2;  Item  6,  at  4)  Although
Applicant  admitted  that  the  account  remains  delinquent,  she  stated,  without  further
explanation,  that  it  is  “under  negotiation.”  In  the  absence  of  documentation  to  support
Applicant’s characterization, the account is not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.d. is a utility account with an unpaid balance of $421 that was charged
off. The last payment was made in November 2017. (Item 5, at 2; Item 6, at 6) Although
Applicant  resided  in  the  city  where  the  utility  was  located,  she  claimed  to  have  no
knowledge of the account. The account is not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.e. is a medical account with an unpaid balance of $390 that was placed
for collection in 2014. (Item 7, at 10; Item 5, at 2; Item 6, at 2) A payment in the amount
of $390 was made on May 21, 2019, approximately one month after the SOR was issued.
(Item 6, at 6; Payment List, undated, attached to Response to the FORM) The account
has been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.f. is a medical account with an unpaid balance of $127 that was placed
for collection in 2018. (Item 6, at 2) A payment in the amount of $127 was made in May
1, 2019, approximately two weeks after the SOR was issued. (Item 6, at 2; Payment List,
undated, attached to Response to the FORM) The account has been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.g. is a cellular telephone account with an unpaid balance of $1,506 that
was  placed for collection  in  2014.  (Item  7,  at  10) Although  Applicant  admitted  that the
account  remains  delinquent,  she  stated,  without  further  explanation,  that  it  is  “under
negotiation for $369.” However, her reference  to the  unpaid balance  of $369  indicates
that she is confusing this account with another delinquent account with the same creditor
with  a  different  account  number  and  different  unpaid  balance.  See  the  information
associated with SOR ¶ 1.i. The account is not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.h. is an Internet account with an unpaid balance of $647 that was placed
for  collection  in  2017.  (Item  7,  at  10)  Applicant  initially  confused  this  account  with  a
medical account, and then noted that it was no longer on her credit report. (Item 4, at 4)
The account is not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.i. is a cellular telephone account with an unpaid balance of $369 that was
placed for collection in 2014. (Item 7, at 10) Although Applicant admitted that the account
remains  delinquent,  she  stated,  without further explanation,  that  she  owes  the amount
and it is “under negotiation.” The account is not yet in the process of being resolved.
Other  than  Applicant’s  unverified  contentions  regarding  her  efforts  to  resolve
certain delinquent accounts, as noted above, there is very little documentary evidence,
such  as  repayment  plans,  cancelled  checks,  bank  account  registers,  or  receipts  from
creditors  to  support  that  she  has  made  any  efforts  to  address  any  of  her  delinquent
accounts before the SOR was issued in April 2019. In January 2020, Department Counsel
noted  in  the  FORM  that  Applicant had  not  provided  any  documentation  to  support her
contentions in her Answer. Despite that notice, with the exception of documents related
to three delinquent accounts, Applicant failed to furnish the appropriate documentation.
In  the  absence  of  such  documentation,  I  conclude  that  Applicant’s  other  delinquent
accounts have not yet entered the process of being resolved.
Despite Applicant’s contention in February 2018 that her overall financial situation
was “better,” it is not known what Applicant’s current financial resources may be because
she did not report her current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly
remainder  that  might  be  available  for  discretionary  spending  or  savings.  There  is  no
evidence of a budget. There is no documentary evidence of financial counseling. In the
absence of additional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is
currently in a better position financially than she had been.
