Applicant, age 63, is divorced without children. He received his GED in 1975. He
graduated  from  a  police  academy  in  1979.  He  received  a  HAZMAT  technician
certification in 1991. He earned two electrician certifications in 2004. Most recently, he
has  been employed  as  an  electrician  by  a  defense  contractor  since  July  2016.  This is
his first application for a security clearance. (Item 3)
In his July 2016 SCA, Applicant reported that he failed to file his federal and state
income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2014. He asserted that his certified public
accountant (CPA) was in the process of preparing them for filing. He also stated that he
expected to receive refunds. (Item 3 at 46-47)
During  his  June  2017  security  clearance  interview  (SI),  Applicant  revealed  that
he  had  not  yet  filed  his  returns  for  tax  years  2012  through  2014.  He  claimed  to  have
provided  his  CPA  with  the  information  necessary  to  file  them  sometime  in  2017.  He
promised to file them by the end of 2017. He  asserted that his 2015 and 2016 federal
and state income tax returns had been filed on unspecified dates, without providing any
corroborating documentation. Without providing any details, he attributed his delinquent
filings  to  being  a  single  man  working  overtime  and  caring  for  his  ailing  mother,  who
passed  away  in  November  2016.  During  his  June  2018  SI,  he  acknowledged  that  he
had not yet filed any federal or state income tax returns for tax years 2012, 2013, 2014,
2016, and 2017. He declared that he misspoke during this 2017 SI due to “human error”
when he stated that he already filed his 2016 return. (Item 2 at 3; Item 4 at 3, 9-10)
In his July 2019 responses to interrogatories, Applicant claimed that his 2015 and
2018 federal and state income tax returns were filed in April 2019. He asserted that he
planned  to  file  his  2017  returns  in  July  2019,  and  his  2016  returns  at  a  future
unspecified time. He claimed that he did not owe any taxes for tax year 2015, and paid
approximately  $1,075  to  the  IRS  and  state  for  tax  year  2018.  He  did  not  clearly
articulate  a  plan  for  filing  his  2012  through  2014  returns.  He  mentioned  that  it  was
beyond the three years during which he would have been eligible for a refund for those
tax  years,  and  then  suggested  that  he  might  believe  that  he  would  not  be  required  to
pay any taxes after that three-year period. He maintained that he was unable to file all
of the delinquent returns  at the same time because he did not have sufficient funds to
pay  his  CPA’s  fees  all  at  once.  He  did  not  provide  any  documents  corroborating  the
return filings or tax payment for tax years 2015 and 2018. (Item 4 at 13-14)
In his September 2019 SOR response, Applicant reaffirmed that his 2015, 2017,
and 2018 federal and state income tax returns had been filed. For unspecified reasons,
he had not received the full refund he was expecting from either the IRS or the state for
tax year 2015. He claimed to have paid an unspecified amount for taxes, late fees, and
penalties for tax year 2017. He did not provide any documents corroborating the return
filings or tax payments for tax years 2015, 2017, and 2018.  He proffered the schedule
by which he planned to file the remaining delinquent returns. Although he was expecting
refunds,  he  understood  that he  will  not  know  the  status  of  his tax  liability,  which  could
include  late  fees  and  penalties,  until  after  the  returns  are  filed  and  processed.  He
planned to file his 2014 and 2016 returns first, within 30 to 45 days from the date of his
SOR response. Then, he would file his 2012 and 2013 returns within 30 to 45 days from
the date he resolved any tax liability for tax years 2014 and 2016.  The purpose of the
staggered scheduling was to ensure that he had sufficient funds to pay any tax liability
owed.  He  also  vaguely  suggested  that  he  may  not  yet  have  provided  all  of  the
information necessary for his CPA to file the delinquent returns. (Item 2)
Applicant  was  unemployed  for  unspecified  reasons  from  April  2010  through
2012,  and  six  times  between  September  2012  and  February  2015  for  one  to  three-
month  periods  each.  He  supported  himself  with  unemployment  compensation  and
savings.  In  June  2017,  he  described  his  financial  status  as  “tight.”  The  record  did  not
otherwise specify details about his ability to meet his expenses, including CPA fees and
taxes. (Item 4 at 5-6, 10)
Applicant is a patriot who believes strongly in supporting the United States. He is
dedicated  to  his  craft.  He  desires  to  serve  his  country  and  vowed  that  he  would  be
diligent  in  protecting  any  classified  information  to  which  he  is  entrusted.  Numerous
members  of  his  family  have  served  in  the  U.S.  military  with  distinction,  including  his
father  who  was  among  the  first  to  train  as  a  member  of  the  U.S.  Navy  underwater
demolition team and an uncle who was a WWII fighter pilot. (Item 2; Item 4 at 15)
