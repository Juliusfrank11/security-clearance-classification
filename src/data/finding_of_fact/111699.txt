Applicant  is  a  50-year-old  general  manager  for  a  defense  contractor,  employed
since  approximately  January  2019.  He  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1993  and  a
master’s degree in 2009. He married in 1991 and divorced in 2010. He remarried in 2014.
He has two children and a stepchild, all adults. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army
from  1993  to  November  2018.  He  did  not  submit  information  regarding  combat  area
deployments or awards. He last served in overseas assignments in Japan (2011 to 2015)
and Germany (2015 to 2018). He retired in November 2018 with the rank of Colonel (0-
6).
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  owes  approximately  $61,245  in  delinquent  student
loans. Specifically, SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.d allege two defaulted government student loans
placed  for  collection  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education  for  $24,788  and  $6,121,
respectively. SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c allege two defaulted private student loans placed for
collection for $19,152 and $7,373, respectively. The SOR allegations are supported by
sufficient evidence in the record.
Applicant’s student loans originated from 2007 to 2009 when he obtained federally
subsidized  and  non-federally  subsidized  loans.  (Item  5)  Applicant’s  2014  credit  report
(Item 10) shows the private student loans were deferred at one time, but were reported
delinquent 150 days past due date with delinquencies occurring in March and April 2014.
The government student loans were listed as deferred as well, but were reported 90 days
past the due date three or more times, and reported delinquent in February and March
2014.
Applicant’s October 2016 credit report (Item 9) shows multiple entries for student
loans. Of note, the entries for three Department of Education loans (government loans)
are listed as in a collection status, with May 2015 listed as the date of last activity (DLA).
The private loans were also listed as past due and in a collection status, with DLAs of
February 2015 and September 2016. Applicant’s March 2020 credit report continues to
show the student-loan accounts listed in the SOR as either past due or in collections.
In  Applicant’s  SCA  of  September  30,  2016,  he  did  not  list  any  student  loan
delinquencies or past-due financial obligations, but he noted a home foreclosure in 2011
due to his divorce and military assignment overseas. (Item 3)
Applicant was interviewed (PSI) in March 2017 in Germany by U.S. Department of
State  security  personnel.  He  denied  knowing  his  student  loans  were  delinquent,  and
stated  that  he  believed  his  loans  were  deferred  while  on  deployment  and  stationed
overseas. He noted that he submitted a deferment request for each of the loans in June
2015,  and  possessed  email  confirmations.  He  explained  that  the  credit  report  entries
showing the loans past due were due to deferments and administrative problems with the
accounts.
On August 15, 2017, while Applicant was on active duty, the DOD CAF first issued
Applicant an LOI and SOR alleging defaulted student loans. (Item 5) Applicant answered
the SOR with an undated letter, submitted in early 2018. (Item 5) Applicant claimed in his
response to the first SOR that he was paying his student loans without incident until about
May 2015, when he resolved a legal dispute related to his divorce. As a result, he was
required to pay alimony and child support. In addition, his new spouse was being treated
for cancer and was not working. He claimed that in 2015 he requested a “forbearance”
from  the  student  loan  servicing  companies  from  paying  his  student  loans,  and  the
payments were not to restart until mid-2016. (Item 5) Applicant did not submit confirmation
of the forbearance requests. He noted that he then began an eight-month effort to discuss
his loan status with his creditors, but was stymied by the “operational” time differences
between the U.S. and Europe, and difficulties getting information from the lenders.
Applicant explained that he subsequently contacted the government student loans
servicing  agency  and  by  February  2018,  agreed  to  make  three  monthly  payments  of
$1,088 each, with the expectation that after three payments, his government loans would
be consolidated. (Item 5) Applicant’s submission with his response to the FORM shows
only one payment was made under this agreement, on February 7, 2018. (AE A-9) It is
unclear  why  successive  payments  of  $1,088  were  not  made  per  the  agreement.  The
record shows that Applicant believed in April 2018 that his security issues were resolved.
(AE A-4)
In  Applicant’s  October  2019  response  to  the  current  SOR,  he  noted  that  the
government loan was “entering” a loan rehabilitation program. (Item 2) He stated that he
provided the required income/debt ratio information and was awaiting terms of payment
and due dates. He said that on his own initiative, he began making $500 payments toward
the  start  of  an  anticipated  nine-month  payment  plan.  (Item  2)  Applicant’s  subsequent
response  to  the  FORM  shows that  Applicant made a $50  payment  on  this account  on
August 29, 2019, and two $500 “good faith” payments in September and October 2019,
that did not apply toward his rehabilitation program. He stated that he made these smaller
“good  faith”  payments  as  he  attempted  to  negotiate  lower  “qualifying”  payments  and
complete  the  required  paperwork.  (AE  A)  Payments  on  this  account  then  ceased  until
January 2020. (AE A-9)
In  November  2019,  Applicant  agreed  to  pay  the  required  amount  on  another
government loan rehabilitation program (labeled as loan 2 on his response to the FORM),
and made four monthly payments of $1,281 beginning in January 2020. He stated that he
is currently negotiating a more affordable repayment plan while maintaining “maximum”
monthly payments on this account. He noted that “although [the government account] is
still in default,” he is in compliance with the rehabilitation plan and expects completion of
the plan in September 2020. (AE A; A-9)
On August 13, 2019, Applicant agreed to participate in a loan-rehabilitation plan to
pay nine qualifying payments of $650 per month on the private student loans. Applicant
began  payments  on  July  31,  2019,  and  continued  consistent  monthly  payments  and
completed the program on April 13, 2020. He was notified that the account was sold to
another lender, and he would be notified of the new repayment terms. (AE A-2; A-10)
No  evidence  of  Applicant’s  current  financial  status  or  financial  counseling  was
submitted. Applicant stressed his nearly 26 years of honorable service in the Army, his
difficult divorce in 2011 after 20 years of marriage, and difficulties with communications
via mail while stationed overseas. Applicant takes responsibility to repay his loans, and
he  believes  that  as  of  September  2020,  he  will  have  met  all  of  his  student  loan
rehabilitation obligations. After that time, they will be considered current and no longer in
default.
