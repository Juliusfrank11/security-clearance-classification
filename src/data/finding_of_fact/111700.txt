In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the two SOR allegations. (HE 3) He also
provided extenuating and mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings
of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.
Applicant  is  a  31-year-old  software  engineer,  and  a  defense  contractor  has
employed him since 2017. (Tr. 22-23; AE C) In 2008, he graduated from high school, and
in 2011, he received a bachelor’s degree in applied mathematics and statistics. (Tr. 24-
25, 29; AE E) He has never married, and he does not have children. (Tr. 22; GE 1)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
In 2008, Applicant began using marijuana when he was a freshman in college and
living in the college dormitories. (Tr. 25, 45) In college, he used marijuana with varying
degrees of frequency about every three months. (Tr. 27, 48) He received marijuana from
friends, and he did not purchase the marijuana that he used. (Tr. 27-28) He knew it was
against the college’s rules to use marijuana. (Tr. 28-29)
From 2012 to 2017, Applicant used marijuana two or three times a year. (Tr. 29)
He  used  marijuana  in  his  residence  with  his  girlfriend  in  2017,  and  his  marijuana  use
occurred in a state where marijuana possession is illegal. (Tr. 43-44, 47) She procured
the marijuana and brought it into his residence. (Tr. 43) Their live-in relationship ended in
November  2018.  (Tr.  43)  He  probably  had  marijuana  in  his  residence  as  recently  as
November 2018. (Tr. 57) Applicant’s most recent use of marijuana was in July 2018. (Tr.
29)  Applicant  used  marijuana  once  in  2018.  (Tr.  31)  In  July  2018,  Applicant’s  sister
provided  edible  marijuana  to  him  in  a  state  where  possession  of  small  amounts  of
marijuana  does  not  violate  state  law.  (Tr.  30,  48-49;  AE  G)  Applicant  did  not  consider
whether he was in violation of any laws or whether marijuana possession and use would
have an adverse effect on his employment when he used marijuana. (Tr. 31-33) He knew
it violated federal law for him to use marijuana. (Tr. 32, 51) He did not think he would be
caught and punished if he used marijuana. (Tr. 32)
When  he  completed  his  SF  86,  Applicant  admitted  marijuana  use,  and  he  was
aware that using marijuana was significant to the process of approval for a public trust
position. (Tr. 33, 50; GE 1) He indicated on his SF 86 that he intended to continue to use
marijuana. (Tr. 35; GE 1) He used marijuana after completing his SF 86 because he was
in a state where possession of small amounts of marijuana is legal, and he was in the
presence of his siblings, “and they were all using.” (Tr. 33)
Recently,  Applicant  informed  his  siblings  that  they  were  not  supposed  to  use
marijuana in his presence in the future, and if they chose to do so, he would leave and it
would adversely affect his relationship with them. (Tr. 38-39; AE D) Some of his friends
used marijuana in his presence in 2017 and 2018, and Applicant did not want to sever his
relationships with them. (Tr. 40, 52) Less than two months before his hearing, Applicant
was at a party where marijuana was being used, and he did not leave the party. (Tr. 53)
He subsequently asked some of his friends not to use marijuana in his presence, and he
promised to leave their presence if they started using marijuana. (Tr. 24, 40-41, 54, 58) If
someone  started  to  use  marijuana  in  his  presence,  Applicant  would  leave.  (Tr.  25)
Applicant said his employer’s policy was to preclude use of marijuana at work, but he was
unaware  of  any  policy  precluding  marijuana  use  during  off-duty  time.  (Tr.  54-55)  His
employer conducts drug testing. (Tr. 55-56) Applicant has never tested positive for the
presence of an illegal drug in his body. (Tr. 56)
After his April 20, 2019 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject
interview (PSI) Applicant decided that he would not use marijuana in the future because
he  realized  it  would  have  a  serious  negative  effect  on  his  employment  and  access  to
sensitive  or  classified  information.  (Tr.  36-37,  41,  63)  On  October  31,  2019,  Applicant
received  a  substance abuse  evaluation from  a person  who  is  a  licensed  clinical  social
worker (LCSW), certified substance abuse counselor (CSAC), master addiction counselor
(MAC), and substance abuse professional (SAP). (AE B) Appellant advised the evaluator
that  he  “sometimes”  used  marijuana  with  his  girlfriend,  and  his  use  was  limited  to  “‘a
couple  of  hits’  every  six  to  nine  months.”  (AE  B1  at  2)  He  indicated  his  most  recent
marijuana use was in July 2018. (AE B1 at 2) The evaluator concluded Applicant has “a
low probability of an alcohol/substance use disorder” and he “is not at risk of relapse or
return  to  his  previous  behavior.”  (AE  B1  at  4)  She  did  not  diagnose  Applicant  with  a
substance use disorder, and she concluded no treatment was warranted. (AE B1 at 4)
She believes Applicant “is fully capable of safeguarding classified information,” and she
said he is “fit for duty in a position affecting national security.” (AE B1 at 4)
Applicant has increased his physical exercises for better health and wellbeing. (AE
F) Applicant does not believe that marijuana use is important to him, and he does not
intend to use it in the future. (Tr. 37; AE A) Applicant agreed “to random drug testing and
to  immediate  and  unqualified  revocation  of  [his]  security  clearance  in  the  event  of  any
future positive drug test.” (AE A)
Character Evidence
Applicant received excellent performance reviews. (AE C)  The general sense of
Applicant’s eight written character statements is that Applicant is honest, loyal, reliable,
trustworthy, and sober. (AE D) He has ended his marijuana use and has made it clear
that he will not remain in the vicinity when marijuana is being used by others. (AE D)
