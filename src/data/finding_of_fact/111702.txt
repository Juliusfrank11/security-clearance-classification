In  his  Answer to  the SOR,  Applicant  admitted,  sometimes  with  brief  comments,
nearly  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  pertaining  to  financial  considerations  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c.
through 1.h., and 1.i.). Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and
upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. It is unclear what his
current  position  is.  He  had  been  serving  as  a  welder  with  his  former  employer  from
January 2018 until August 2019. He also previously served in similar full-time or part-time
positions with other employers from December 2014 until January 2018. He enlisted in
the  U.S.  Navy  Reserve  (Inactive)  in  July  2000,  and  he  served  until  he  was  honorably
discharged in January 2012. He is a 2000 high school graduate. He attended one college
for  ten  months  and  received  a  certification  as  a  pharmacy  technician  in  2013,  and  he
attended another university at several locations around the country for over two years,
but has not received a degree. He has never held a security clearance. He was married
in 2011, and divorced in 2013. He has been cohabiting since 2015. He has three children,
born in 2004, 2016, and 2017.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can  be  found  in  the  following  exhibits:  Item  3  (Combined  Experian,  TransUnion,  and
Equifax Credit Report, dated April 11, 2018); Item 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated March
18, 2019); Item 5 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated November 2, 2018); Item 2 (SF 86),
dated February 27, 2018); Item 1 (Applicant’s Answer to SOR, dated May 15, 2019); and
Response to the FORM, undated).
Applicant noted that he was unemployed from February 2012 until April 2013 while
he was attending college; from July 2013 until April 2014, after he quit a job because he
was enrolled in college and could not balance both the school and work hours required,
and he relocated from one state to another. He was also unemployed from February 2017
until June 2017, after he resigned in anticipation of a furlough. (Item 2, at 16-17, 20-21)
While  he  did  not  attribute  his  financial  problems  to  any  factors  other  than  having
insufficient funds, he did mention that he had been irresponsible. (Item 5, at 6)
On November 2, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S.
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  During  the  interview,  he  claimed  that  after
February 2018, he had engaged the professional services of a particular national law firm
to  assist  him  in  resolving  his  delinquent  debts  by  negotiating  reduced  balances  for
potential settlement, and removing certain accounts from his credit report. He said that
he was paying that firm $129 per month to fulfill its obligations.  He also stated that he
has received financial counseling and debt consolidation services, but he failed to identify
by whom those services were being provided, and when those services took place. (Item
5,  at  4-6)  Applicant  failed  to  submit  any  documentation  regarding  the  reported
professional  relationship  with  the  national  law  firm,  or  to  confirm  any  of  the  reported
activities that may have been taken on his behalf.
The SOR alleged a failure to timely file his 2016 federal income tax return, as well
as ten delinquent accounts totaling nearly $31,500, as set forth as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a. is an automobile insurance account with an unpaid balance  of $302
that was placed for collection in 2016. (Item 3, at 8; Item 5, at 6) During his OPM interview,
Applicant claimed he had paid it off in April 2018. (Item 5, at 6) However, in his Answer
to the SOR, he claimed the account was paid in full as of March 2018. (Item 1, at 4) One
of the attachments to his Response to the FORM is a letter from the collection agent for
the creditor, dated August 2, 2019, attesting to the fact that the account has been paid in
full. The account has been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b. is an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance of $3,370 that
was charged off and placed of collection in 2010, and eventually purchased by another
lender. (Item 3, at 8) Neither Applicant nor his national law firm had any knowledge about
the account, and it is no longer listed in his 2019 credit report. (Item 5, at 6; Item 1, at 4)
The account remains unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c. is a charge account with a furniture store with an unpaid balance of
$610 that was charged off and placed for collection in 2010. (Item 3, at 9; Item 5, at 6)
Applicant  admitted  the  allegation,  but  subsequently  submitted  a  document  from  the
creditor entitled “credit card payment arrangements,” dated August 13, 2019, calling for
payments  of  $329  to  commence  on  September  5,  2019,  and  continue  each  month
thereafter until the unpaid balance, by August 2019, increased to nearly $1,302, is paid
in full. (Letter, dated August 13, 2019, attached to Applicant’s Response to the FORM)
During the ensuing five months, Applicant failed to submit any documentation, such as a
cancelled check, a bank register, a credit card statement, or a receipt from the creditor to
confirm that he has been in compliance with those arrangements. In the absence of such
documentation, it is impossible to determine if Applicant is yet in the process of resolving
the account.
SOR ¶ 1.d. is a medical account from the emergency room at a local hospital with
an unpaid balance of $518 that was placed for collection in 2016. (Item 3, at 9; Item 5, at
6) During his OPM interview, Applicant acknowledged that the account had not yet been
resolved and that his national law firm was negotiating with the creditor. In his Answer to
the SOR, he admitted the allegation, but noted that there was a repayment arrangement
under which Applicant would pay the creditor $100 starting June 1, 2019, and the account
would be paid in full by the end of that month. (Item 1, at 4) Things apparently changed,
for Applicant subsequently submitted a receipt for $120 that was paid on August 2, 2019,
supposedly leaving an unpaid balance of $190. (Receipt, dated August 2, 2019, attached
to  Applicant’s  Response  to  the  FORM)  Applicant  failed  to  explain  the  changes  in  the
repayment  arrangements,  and  with  the  exception  of  the  receipt  for  $120,  he  failed  to
submit  any  documentation,  such  as  a  cancelled  check,  a  bank  register,  a  credit  card
statement, or a receipt from the creditor to confirm that he has been in compliance with
those revised arrangements. Nevertheless, at appears that the account is in the process
of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.e. is a gymnasium or fitness center account with an unpaid balance of
$624 that was placed for collection in 2013. (Item 3, at 10; Item 5, at 6) In his Answer,
Applicant  admitted  the  allegation,  but  noted  that  there  was  a  repayment  arrangement
under which Applicant would pay the creditor a total of approximately $312, split into two
payments starting June 7, 2019, and the account would be paid in full by the end of that
month. (Item 1, at 4) Applicant subsequently submitted a receipt, dated August 2, 2019,
which  stated  that  the  account  is  now  “settled  in  full.”  (Receipt,  dated  August  2,  2019,
attached to Applicant’s Response to the FORM) The account has been resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.f.  is  an  automobile  loan  that  Applicant  co-signed  for  a  friend  with  an
unpaid balance of $12,801 that was placed for collection in 2013. (Item 3, at 10; Item 5,
at 6) Applicant admitted the allegation, but noted that his co-signer – the primary debtor
– on the loan has already commenced payment arrangements as of February 2018. (Item
1, at 4) Applicant failed to submit any documentation, such as a copy of the repayment
arrangements,  cancelled  checks,  a  bank  register,  credit  card  statements,  a  statement
from the co-signer, or receipts from the creditor to confirm that one or both co-signers
have  been  in  compliance  with  those  arrangements.  In  the  absence  of  such
documentation, it is impossible to determine if the account is yet in the process of being
resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.g. is a telephone account with an unpaid balance of $987 that was placed
for collection in 2018. (Item 3, at 10; Item 5, at 5) Applicant initially claimed that the issue
first arose in 2015, but admitted the allegation, and indicated that the national law firm
was trying to negotiate a potential settlement amount. (Item 5, at 5; Item 1, at 4) In his
Response to the FORM, Applicant stated that the collection agent advised him that the
account had been taken from them and forwarded to another collection agency, and that
the creditor was unable to furnish him information regarding the new collection agent, or
give  him  a  written  note  of  their  conversation.  Applicant  failed  to  submit  any
documentation, including reports from the national law firm, or correspondence from him
or the national law firm to the creditor or collection agent, or back to them. The account
is not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.h. is a school loan or grant with an unpaid balance of $3,018 that was
charged off in 2013 for which Applicant was responsible when he failed to finish college.
(Item 3, at 11; Item 4, at 2; Item 5, at 5) He admitted the allegation, and he acknowledged
that the account remains unresolved. (Item 1, at 4; Response to the FORM)
SOR ¶ 1.i. is a child support indebtedness or arrearage with an unpaid balance of
$605. He was delinquent in his payments in April, May, and June 2018. (Item 3, at 11;
Item 4, at 2; Item 5, at 5) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegation and
claimed that the account has been in good standing and current as of April 2018. (Item 1,
at 4) His current monthly support obligation is $521. As of July 29, 2019, his balance to
the payee – the mother of his first child – is zero. (Case Summary Information, dated July
29,  2019,  attached  to  Applicant’s  Response  to  the  FORM)  The  account  has  been
resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.j. is an automobile loan on a vehicle worth  approximately $26,867 that
was repossessed in 2016 leaving an unpaid balance of $8,576 that was charged off. (Item
3, at 11; Item 4, at 1; Item 5, at 4) He admitted the allegation, and he acknowledged that
the account remains unresolved. (Item 1, at 4; Response to the FORM)
SOR ¶ 1.k. refers to Applicant’s failure to timely file his 2016 federal income tax
return.  (Item  5,  at  4) Applicant  denied  the allegation,  claiming  that  he had filed  his tax
return in December 2018, and that he was making monthly $200 payments to the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS).  (Item 1, at 4) He failed to submit documentation, such as an IRS
account transcript or a copy of his income tax return to indicate the date when the income
tax return was actually filed. Although he discussed with the OPM investigator his failure
to  timely  file  the  income  tax  return  because  he  didn’t  have  his  W-2s;  reported  that  he
owed the IRS approximately $9,000 in unpaid taxes; and that he intended to consult with
a tax relief representative in the near future, the SOR did not allege those unpaid taxes,
and that fact is considered unalleged conduct. (Item 5, at 4) Applicant submitted an extract
of  his  Installment  Agreement  with  the  IRS  as  part  of  his  Response  to  the  FORM,  and
while it does not expressly state when the federal income tax return was filed, it does refer
to an unpaid balance of nearly $8,933, including over $1,255 in interest and penalties as
of July 10, 2019, and a $200 payment having been made on June 17, 2019. (Installment
Agreement, dated July 10, 2019, attached to Applicant’s Response to the FORM)
As  noted  above,  Applicant’s  SOR  does  not  allege  that  he  owed  federal  income
taxes. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed
five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:
(a)  to  assess  an  applicant’s  credibility;  (b)  to  evaluate  an  applicant’s
evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to
consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;
(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is
applicable;  or  (e)  to  provide  evidence  for  whole  person  analysis  under
Directive Section 6.3.
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-
0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd.
April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR
Case  No.  03-20327  at  4  (App.  Bd.  Oct.  26,  2006)).  Applicant’s  unpaid  federal  income
taxes, associated with his failure to timely file his 2016 federal income tax return, will not
be considered except for the five purposes listed above.
It is not known what Applicant’s current financial resources may be because he did
not report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder
that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a
budget.  There  is  no  evidence  of  financial  counseling  other  than  Applicant  unverified
comments  referring  to  it.  In  the  absence  of  additional  financial  information,  it  remains
difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had
been.
