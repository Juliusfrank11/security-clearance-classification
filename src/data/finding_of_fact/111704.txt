The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the July 12, 2019 SOR, Applicant
failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017,
and 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.a), and that he owes $8,512 in past-due federal income taxes for tax
year 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.b). Additionally, the SOR alleges that he owes $51,878 in delinquent
credit-card debt (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.d and 1.f-1.i) and $11,821 on a charged-off vehicle lease
(SOR ¶ 1.e). When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he denied that he had failed
to  timely  file  federal  income  tax  returns,  but  he  admitted  owing  the  alleged  debts.  He
presented documentation showing that he was in an installment repayment plan for his
federal taxes for tax year 2014. (Items 1-2.) After considering the FORM, which includes
Applicant’s Answer to the SOR (Item 2), I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is a 59-year-old college graduate with a bachelor’s degree awarded in May
1983. He served as an officer in a branch of the National Guard from May 1982 to May
1983 and as an officer in the inactive reserve from March 1983 to February 1985. He has
been married to his current spouse since July 2013. He was married to his first wife from
October 1983 to March 2012. He has two sons, ages 21 and 26, from that marriage. (Items
3-4.)
Applicant worked as a civilian project manager for a branch of the U.S. military from
September 2001 to November 2004. He held a DOD secret clearance for that job. As of
June 2002, he was making payments on a credit-card account in collection and on $6,789
in student-loan debt. A federal tax lien of $13,011, filed in October 1997, was satisfied in
April  2003.  (Item  9.)  He  left  federal  service  for  a  director’s  position  with  a  defense
contractor in November 2004, and while in that job, his clearance eligibility was upgraded
to top secret in December 2012. He stayed on with his then employer after a corporate
merger,  but  in  2014,  the  new  company  ceased  operating  due  to  financial  problems.
Applicant worked as a consultant from April 2014 to January 2015 for a company that
serviced federal and state agencies. In January 2015, he began his current employment in
the defense industry as the director of a company that manufactures custom mechanical
systems. (Items 3-4.)
On  April  14,  2017,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on which he responded “Yes” to an
inquiry concerning whether, in the last seven years, he had failed to file or pay federal,
state, or other taxes, when required by law or ordinance. He indicated that he had worked
as a consultant in 2014 and failed to have enough taxes withheld. He commented that he
was currently repaying an $8,500 tax debt for tax year 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.b) at $185 a month
to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under a repayment plan. In response to inquiries
concerning any delinquency involving routine accounts in the last seven years, Applicant
listed a $16,000 auto-lease debt for a vehicle “returned” (voluntarily surrendered) in 2015
(SOR ¶ 1.e). He explained that he had to pay child support and medical expenses for his
spouse. (Item 3.)
A  check  of  Applicant’s  credit  on  June  21,  2017,  revealed  several  credit-card
delinquencies. A credit card with an $8,140 balance was past due 30 days for $163 (SOR ¶
1.g). Two credit-card accounts obtained from a bank were in collection for $16,219 (SOR ¶
1.c) and $10,606 (SOR ¶ 1.f) with no activity on the accounts since 2015. A credit-card
account opened in February 2013 was placed in collection for $3,346 (SOR ¶ 1.i). A credit-
card debt from December 2015 was in collection for $4,040 (SOR ¶ 1.h). A credit-card debt
of  $12,900  from  January  2016  had  a  collection  balance  of  $14,072  (SOR  ¶  1.d).  He
reportedly owed $11,698 on the defaulted automobile lease (SOR ¶ 1.e). Applicant was
making timely payments on a credit card with a balance of $154; on a car loan obtained for
$4,046 in December 2014 with a $1,116 balance; and on a mortgage balance of $209,585.
He obtained the mortgage in June 2012 for $231,282. (Item 7.)
On August 14, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). When asked about his financial delinquencies,
Applicant did not dispute the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.e. He indicated that the debts were
incurred because his spouse was unemployed and had significant medical issues that were
not covered by insurance. Additionally, he had to remain current with his child support
payments. Concerning the credit-card debt in SOR ¶ 1.c, Applicant stated that he was
working on a settlement offer and expected to have a payment plan in place no later than
October 2018. As for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d, which he admitted was in collection, he stated
that he would contact the collection entity about a possible settlement and repayment plan
by October 2018. Regarding the lease for the surrendered vehicle (SOR ¶ 1.e), Applicant
indicated  that  he  was  awaiting  correspondence  from  the  creditor about  any  deficiency
balance.  When  asked  whether  he  had  any  other  delinquent  accounts,  Applicant
volunteered that he had a second account with the bank identified in SOR ¶ 1.f on which
he  settled  a  $2,250  balance  for  $640  paid  in  three  installments.  He  denied  any  other
delinquencies,  but  then  did  not  dispute  the  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.f,  1.h,  and  1.i  when
confronted. Applicant indicated that  the creditor owed the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i
refused to settle and wanted lump-sum payments that he could not afford. He expressed
his intention to pay the debts. As for the credit card that was 30 days past due (SOR ¶ 1.g),
Applicant  indicated  that  the  account  was  closed  and  had  never  been  over  120  days
delinquent. Applicant denied he was delinquent on any federal state or local income taxes,
explaining that he was current on his payment plan with the IRS for his 2014 taxes. (Item
4.)
Applicant made no progress toward resolving his delinquent credit-card balances by
March 2019. Contrary to what Appellant had claimed during his OPM interview, the account
in  SOR  ¶  1.g  had become $3,595 past due and was  charged off. He reportedly owed
$8,923 on the account as of March 2019. Additionally, a $295 medical debt from February
2018 was in collection (not alleged in SOR). (Item 6.)
In response to May 9, 2019 interrogatories from DOHA, Applicant provided proof of
his  installment  plan  for  his  federal  income  tax  delinquency  for  tax  year  2014.  He  also
submitted requested IRS account transcripts for tax years 2011 through 2015 and 2017
through 2018. Applicant indicated that his account transcript for tax year 2016 was not
available on the IRS’ system because of identity theft. In response to a June 13, 2019
request from Applicant for his tax transcript, the IRS informed him that the IRS was unable
to process the requested tax year at this time, but that he could contact the identity theft
number for any tax year not available. (Item 5.)
Applicant submits that he has filed all of his federal tax returns according to IRS tax
requirements. However, tax account transcripts from the IRS (Item 5) show that he filed
late returns for tax years 2011, 2012, and 2014. Relevant tax information as reported by
the IRS is set forth in the following table.

The  $18,203  AGI  for  tax  year  2013  does  not  seem  accurate,  given  his  W-2
withholdings were $23,849. There is no explanation in the record to explain the low AGI.
The IRS tax transcript for tax year 2014 shows that Applicant had only $8,143 in federal
income  taxes  withheld  on  a  tax  liability  of  $50,518  (SOR  ¶  1.b).  He  had  worked  for  a
company until April 2014 that year, which explains the withholdings. He apparently made
little  or  no  tax  payments  on  his  income  as  a  consultant.  Concerning  repayment  of
delinquent taxes for 2014, the IRS tax transcript shows that he made a payment to the IRS
of $7,339 on April 15, 2015. When he filed his return on October 20, 2015, five days past
the extended deadline, he paid $13,792 with his return. He was penalized $1,369 plus
$656  for  late  payment.  On  January  14,  2016,  Applicant  entered  into  an  installment
agreement to repay his tax delinquency at $185 per month. His tax refund of $5,174 for tax
year  2015  was  credited  to  his  account  on  April  15,  2016,  and  he  made  a  payment  of
$5,880 on May 31, 2016. His payments under the installment agreement began on July 21,
2016. As of June 24, 2019, the IRS was reporting a balance owed of $8,521 for tax year
2014. (Item 5.)
On July 22, 2019, Applicant received the SOR alleging financial considerations,
because of his outstanding tax delinquency for tax year 2014 and unpaid consumer-credit
delinquencies. When he responded to the SOR allegations on July 29, 2019, he denied
late filing of returns but admitted the debts. (Item 2.) Applicant received the Government’s
FORM on September 16, 2019. Applicant presented no evidence of any payments on the
seven  consumer-credit  delinquencies  alleged  in  the  SOR  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c-1.i)  either  in
response  to  the  SOR  or  the  FORM.  The  IRS  tax  transcripts  report  some  income
information for Applicant, but he provided no information about his monthly expenses apart
from his $185 monthly payment to the IRS. Applicant also provided no information about
the extent of his spouse’s medical expenses or his child support payments that reportedly
caused his financial difficulties.
