In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  disputed  a  U.S.  Department  of  Veterans
Affairs  (VA)  debt  and  admitted  the  five  collection  accounts  and  the  indebtedness  for
Federal income taxes and the state tax lien listed in the SOR. After a thorough review of
the testimony, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  senior  items  analyst  who  has  worked  for  a  defense
contractor  since  January  2018  and  seeks  to  obtain  a  security  clearance.  (Tr.  6)  He
married in December 2013 and has a 16-year-old stepchild. He has two children, ages 8
and 10, from previous relationships. (Ex. 1, Tr. 34, 67) He is current on his $1,750 monthly
child support obligations. (Tr. 43) In January 2020, his 8-year-old son moved to the same
state where Applicant resides, which may lessen the amount of support he  will have to
pay for his son. His annual salary is currently approximately $97,500. (Tr. 46) Overtime
pay is possible with his position, which would increase his yearly income. (Tr. 46)
Applicant’s  wife  is  currently  not  working  outside  of  the  home,  but  is  currently
receiving approximately $4,000 monthly in workers’ compensation due to an on-the-job
injury incurred in November 2019. (Tr. 46, 48, 50)  She is currently in physical therapy.
(Tr. 49) When injured, she was a senior logistics coordinator working in Iraq. (Tr. 49, 51)
She worked in Iraq in 2012 and 2013 and again from 2018 to 2019. (Tr. 52) He met his
wife when both were working as contractors at the same overseas location.
From  March  2004  to February  2012,  Applicant  honorably  served  on  active  duty
with  the  Army  National  Guard.  He  separated  as  a  staff  sergeant  (E-6).  (Ex.  2,  Tr.  26)
While on active duty, he had two tours to Iraq and one tour to Afghanistan. (Tr. 30) The
U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs rates Applicant’s disability at 70 percent due to post
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). (Tr. 9) His retirement and disability pay is approximately
$1,600  monthly.  (Tr.  9)  From  February  2012  to  May  2016,  he  worked  as  a  civilian
contractor at Bagram, Afghanistan. (Ex. 2, Tr. 34) While overseas for two years, he gave
his sister $500 monthly. (Tr. 36-37) He continues to provide a few hundred dollars monthly
in financial assistance to his two younger sisters and younger brother. (Tr. 37, 40)
Applicant got behind on his finances when he returned from overseas. When he
returned,  he  obtained  a  job  at  a  much  reduced  salary.  (Tr.  54)  His  salary  went  from
between $87,000 and $133,000 per year, when he was working overseas, to $32,000 to
$36,000 annually when he returned to the United States. (Tr. 54)The cost of living and
his child support obligations also contributed to his inability to pay his obligations.
The SOR alleges  six collection non-tax debts totaling $9,811 of which three are
Department of Education accounts that total $4,131. One of the collection accounts was
a  $4,416  VA  debt  (SOR  1.f),  which  Applicant  disputed.  He  owed  $10,079  in  Federal
income  tax  for  tax  years  2012,  2013,  2015,  and  2017  (SOR  1.g).  He  was  $1,665
delinquent for a state income tax lien (SOR 1.h). In 2018 a state tax lien was entered for
tax year 2013. (Tr. 67) He had filed his 2013 state income tax return in April 2014. (Ex. E,
Tr.  24,  66)  He  has  been  repaying  his  Federal  tax  delinquency  under  a  repayment
agreement established with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in February 2017.
Applicant incurred a $1,026 debt for the purchase of a computer (SOR 1.a).  (Tr.
54) The account had gone to collection, but the debt was paid in July 2019. (Ex. A, Tr. 8)
Four  times  he  requested  documentation  from  the  creditor  showing  the  debt  has  been
paid, but received no response. (Ex. A) He incurred a $238 debt (SOR 1.b) for insurance
that went to collection. The debt was incurred when he changed insurance companies.
(Ex. 4) The debt was paid in June 2019. (Ex. B) He has an installment agreement to pay
the three Department of Education collection accounts (SOR 1.c, $480; SOR 1.d, $1,101,
and SOR 1.e, $2,550). (SOR Response) As of February 2019, the amount owed on his
three Department of Education accounts was $4,890. (SOR Response) As of the hearing
date, the amount owed was $3,800. (Tr. 59) In January 2020, he paid $1,000 and entered
into a repayment agreement to pay the education debts by April 2020. (Tr. 20, Ex. C, Ex.
E)
When  Applicant  responded  to  the  SOR,  he  disputed  the  VA  $4,416  collection
account  (SOR  1.f).  Applicant  believes  the  debt  may  have  been  incurred  for  personal
equipment that he asserted he had turned in when he left the National Guard. (Tr. 23) He
had turned in the equipment and received a hand receipt, but believed he was still being
held responsible for the equipment. (Tr. 23) The debt was paid in full on August 28, 2014.
(Ex. D)
Applicant hired an accounting firm to submit his Federal income tax returns. (Ex.3
page 29) For tax years 2011 and 2012, he received Federal tax refunds of $1,093 and
$1,214. (Ex. 3 pages 7, 8) For tax year 2013, he owed Federal income tax of $5,497 on
an  income  of  $133,134.  (Ex.  3  pages  10,  11,  30,  36,  and  37)  For  tax  year  2014,  he
received  a  $280  refund  on  income  of  $89,329.  (Ex.  3  page  45)  For  tax  year  2015,  he
owed $1,687 in Federal income tax on income of $87,354. (Ex. 3 pages 13, 15) For tax
year  2016,  he  received  a  tax  refund  of  $328.  (Ex.  3,  pages  19,  26,  and  59)  The  IRS
applied $185 of his refund to his 2012 Federal income tax debt. (Ex. 3 page 26)
In  April  2014,  Applicant  entered  into  an  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS  to
repay  his  tax  indebtedness  then  at  $5,497.  (Ex.  3  page  34,  SOR  Response)  That
installment  agreement  ended  when  a  required  monthly  payment  was  not  made.  In
February  2017,  he  made  another  repayment  agreement  with  the  IRS  to  have  $185
automatically deducted monthly from his checking account. (Ex. 4, Ex. D, Tr. 24, Tr. 25,
Tr. 76) The installment agreement with the IRS covers the $10,079 in taxes owed for tax
years 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2017 (SOR 1.g). He provided documentation showing he
made  six  monthly  payments  of  $185  each:  in  August  2019,  September 2019,  October
2019, November 2019, January 2020, and February 2020. (Ex. E). He also made a $190
payment in September 2019 and a $500 payment in January 2020. (Ex. E, Tr. 76) His
total  payments  since  August  2019  have  been  $1,960.  Additionally,  tax  refunds  were
intercepted and applied to his tax liability. (Tr. 78)
In  Applicant’s  August  2018  Electronic  Questionnaires
Investigations
Processing (e-QIP), he acknowledged he had failed to file or pay his Federal income tax
as required by law, and he acknowledged the state tax lien. (Ex. 1) He explained that he
married in 2013 and did not file his taxes in that state because he resided in another state.
The  state  informed  him  he  owed  $9,300,  however  the  tax  lien  was  for  $1,665.  As  of
January 21, 2020, he had no state tax liability. (Ex. F)
for
Applicant and his wife are current on their monthly vehicle payments of $442 and
$500 each. (Tr. 45-46) They are current on their $1,450 monthly rent. (Tr. 47) He is not
receiving  calls  or  letters  from  creditors  demanding  payment.  The  move  to  his  current
location resulted in him paying $1,000 less in rent, $200 less in transportation expenses,
and having a lower cost of living. Applicant believes he has $1,500 to $1,700 per month
more income to address his debts following his move to his current state. (Tr. 81)
