Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and  the  cross-allegation,  SOR  ¶  2.a,  with
explanations. I have incorporated his admissions and statements into the findings of fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 35 years old. He was married from 2004 to 2011 and he has a 17-
year-old son from this marriage, which ended in divorce. He remarried in 2014. He and
his wife have a three-year old daughter. (GE 2 at 5) Applicant graduated from high school
in  2002.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  from  2005  to  2009,  and  was  discharged
honorably. He earned an associate’s degree in 2013 and a bachelor’s degree in 2016.
(GE 1) In early 2020, he was accepted into a master’s degree program. (AE H) Applicant
has  held  a  security  clearance  since  2005.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a
defense contractor, since April 2009, shortly after leaving the Air Force. (Tr. 26-29, 36-
38, 67; GE 1) He has an annual salary of $100,000. (Tr. 73)
In  September  2013,  Applicant  went  to  a  pool  hall  after  work.  He  consumed  a
pitcher of beer over the course of the evening. While driving home, he was pulled over by
police for having a light out on his car. He failed a roadside sobriety test, registering a
blood  alcohol  content  of  0.06.  A  search  of  his  car  revealed  a  container  of  marijuana.
(Answer; Tr. 30)
Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol
(DUI)  and  possession  of  marijuana.  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  In  March  2014,  through  a  plea
agreement, the DUI charge was dismissed, and the marijuana possession charge was
reduced  to  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia,  to  which  Applicant  pleaded  guilty.  He
received a 90-day suspended jail term and two years of unsupervised probation. He was
required to attend four meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), to attend a 48-hour drug
rehabilitation  program,  and  to  submit  to  random  drug  screenings.  Applicant  completed
the requirements of probation in late June 2014. (Answer; AE A; GE 2 at 8, 11; GE 3; Tr.
30-37) He has not used illegal drugs since his 2013 offense. He recognizes that using
marijuana, particularly with a clearance, was a very poor decision. (Tr. 41, 54, 67)
Applicant testified that his 2013 arrest occurred in the aftermath of a family tragedy.
His sister, who had suffered from a severe mental impairment due to a car accident as a
teenager years before, passed away in April 2013 at age 27. Applicant did not pursue
grief counseling. He dealt with his grief by self-medicating with marijuana from May to
September  2013.  He  also went  out  drinking with  friends.  (Tr.  30-34,  40-41,  46,  68-69)
Applicant described his drinking pattern at the time as “severe.” He consumed six drinks
a day, and “upwards of 10 sometimes on weekends.” (Tr. 46)
Applicant  abstained  from  drinking  for  about  six  months  after  his  2013  DUI.  He
resumed  drinking  during  his  honeymoon  in  August  2014.  He  limited  his  drinking
somewhat. He would consume two or three beers with dinner a few nights a week and
six beers on weekends. He also continued to go out drinking on occasion. (Tr. 46-47, 50-
54, 69-70, 74)
In July 2015, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) to renew
his clearance. He disclosed his 2013 offense. (GE 1)
In  August  2017,  Applicant  was  out  with  family  members  celebrating  his  wife’s
birthday. He consumed two or three beers over a three-hour period. While driving home,
he drove off the road while looking at his cell phone, striking a telephone pole. Applicant
refused to take a roadside field sobriety test, and he was arrested on a charge of DUI.
(Answer; GE 2 at 5-6; GE 3; Tr. 55-56) (SOR ¶ 2.a) Applicant does not believe he was
intoxicated at the time. (Tr. 74) He acknowledged that, unlike with the 2013 offense, there
was no real triggering event for the 2017 DUI beyond his own poor decision making. (Tr.
70)
In February 2018, Applicant was found guilty of DUI. He was fined and received a
60-day suspended jail term and two years of probation. He appealed to the circuit court.
(GE 3) In August 2018, Applicant entered a diversion program. He was ordered to pay
court  costs  and  fees,  to  perform  100  hours  of  community  service,  to  participate  in  an
alcohol  evaluation,  to  attend  a  victim-impact  panel,  and  to  attend  four  AA  meetings.
Applicant  completed  the  requirements  in  April  2019,  and  the  charge  was  dismissed  in
June 2019. (Answer; AE B; GE 2, GE 4, GE 5; Tr. 56-60)
As part of the diversion program, Applicant participated in alcohol counseling from
November 2018 until April 2019. In his initial screening in November 2018, Applicant was
diagnosed  with  alcohol  abuse  disorder  under  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of
Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) by a licensed alcohol and drug counselor. (AE C;
Tr. 41-44)
Applicant testified that the counseling program involved weekly group meetings for
eight weeks. He had to abstain from drinking during the program. He said he benefited
significantly from the program, and credited his participation in counseling with changing
his priorities. He became more goal-oriented. (Tr. 47-49) Applicant’s counselor submitted
a letter of recommendation noting that Applicant completed the program successfully and
attesting to Applicant’s maintenance of a healthy lifestyle. (AE E, AE G)
After his second DUI, Applicant stopped going to pool halls and started going to
the gym. He ceased drinking during the week. He testified that when he drank alcohol
outside the home, he would use ride-share programs to return to his home. Applicant is
now in a management position at work and knows the potential impact his actions would
have on his career. (Tr. 60-62, 71; AE C) He said he was last intoxicated at a party at his
house on New Year’s Eve in December 2019, when he consumed three  or four beers
over the course of the evening. (Tr. 74-75)
Applicant participated in court-ordered AA and a few additional sessions. He felt
that he did not benefit from his participation in AA. (Tr. 72-73) He had two subsequent
appointments with his counselor, but is not currently in alcohol counseling or AA. (Tr. 41-
45, 60, 75; AE G)
Applicant feels his alcohol consumption is now under control. He said, “I don’t need
it” to relax or to “de-stress” (Tr. 63-64) Applicant recognized that it took the second DUI
for him to change his outlook. He blamed the first DUI on events in his life and on his drug
use. He is now more focused on professional advancement and on his family. He accepts
full responsibility for his actions. (Tr. 116-119)
In February 2020, Applicant submitted documentation from his alcohol counselor,
who  found  that  Applicant  does  not  meet  the  diagnostic  criteria  for  any  alcohol  use  or
substance  abuse  disorders  under  the  DSM-5.  As  a  result,  no  treatment  was
recommended. (AE J, AE K)
Applicant’s  father  testified  that  Applicant  is  a  dedicated  father  and  a  good  son.
They  are  very  close.  He  said  he  was  not  aware  that  his  son  had  a  drinking  problem.
Applicant’s father, who served in the Air Force and held a clearance, regards his son as
very trustworthy. They do not talk about Applicant’s work, but instead discuss their shared
interests, like college sports. (Tr. 78-85)
Applicant’s wife testified that he is a good father. He is very intelligent and tactful.
She is very proud of him for being so driven and goal-oriented. Applicant does not drink
to excess. (Tr. 100-104)
Applicant’s  direct  supervisor  testified  that  Applicant  has  worked  for  him  for  11
years. Applicant informed him about his two arrests when they occurred. Applicant has a
great  work  ethic.  He  is  “a  bright  and  upcoming  star.”  He  is  trusted  and  liked  in  the
workplace. Applicant knows what he did was wrong. The supervisor testified that “I would
trust him with my life.” (Tr. 87-98; AE E, AE F) A coworker of Applicant’s provided a letter
of recommendation expressing similar sentiments. (AE E)
