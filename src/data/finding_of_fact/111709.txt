Applicant  admitted  to  both  allegations  in  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 15 line
1  to  page  19  line  5.)  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Army  for  eight  years,  has  been  employed
with the defense contractor since 1998, and has held a security clearance for about “20
years.” (Id.) He is single, and has no children. (TR at page 18 lines 8~13.)
Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption
1.b. In October of 2009, Applicant was arrested, charged and subsequently pled
guilty  to  Driving  under the  influence  (DUI).  (TR at  page  19  line 11  to  page  26  line  12,
and GX 4.) He was “at a bar,” consuming “a couple of beers and a couple of shots.” (TR
at page 23 lines 9~17.) [Later at his hearing, Applicant defined “a couple of beers and a
couple of shots” as “five/six beers . . . two/three” shots of alcohol.] (TR at page 29 lines
9~15.) Pursuant to his guilty plea, Applicant paid a $250 fine, and a 90 day jail sentence
was suspended. (GX 4.)

guilty to Driving with a Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) of Over .08%. (TR at page 26 line
13 to page 37 line 6, and GX 5.) He was at a friend’s house, attending a barbeque. (Id.)
Applicant consumed “five/six beers . . . two/three” shots of alcohol. (TR at page 29 lines
9~15.)  Pursuant to his guilty plea in September of 2017, Applicant paid a $1,839 fine,
attended  counseling,  and  was  placed  on probation for three  years.  (GXs  5 and  6.)  He
has successfully completed that counseling. (AppX A.)
However,  Applicant  remains  on  probation  until  September  of  2020,  and  he  still
consumes alcohol. (TR at page at page 26 line 13 to page 37 line 6, at page 37 lines
