In  Applicant’s  answer to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  the allegation  in  SOR  ¶  2.a and
denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  2.b.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  in  my
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  66-year-old  software  developer  employed  by  a  federal  contractor
since August 2011. He received a bachelor’s degree in 1975. He worked for other federal
contractors from February to October 2001, July 2006 to February 2008, and from March
2011  until  he  began  his  current  job.  According  to  his  SCA,  he  has  held  a  security
clearance since about 2004. (FORM Item 4 at 48.)
Applicant  married  in  January  1981,  divorced  in  February  2012,  and  married  in
December 2017. He has two sons from his first marriage, ages 32 and 29.
When Applicant submitted his SCA in January 2018, he did not disclose any use
of illegal substances. In an affidavit provided to a security investigator in May 2018, he
disclosed that he used a substance he believed was marijuana as well as liquid forms of
tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC)  and  cannabidiol  (CBD)  from  February  2015  to  November
2017. At the time, he lived in a state where the substances were legal. He stopped using
them when he moved to another state were the substances were illegal. Both THC and
CBD  are  extracts  of  marijuana  and  are  prohibited  substances  under  the  Controlled
Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq.
Applicant  used  the  illegal  substances  every  one  or  two  weeks.  He  used  the
substances for pain relief, because he was grossly overweight but was unable to exercise
due  to  severe  knee  pain.  He  told  the  security  investigator  that  he  used  the  illegal
substances because he felt that his health was more important than the rules for holding
a security clearance. He also told the investigator that he did not intend to continue to use
the illegal substances because they were illegal in his state of residence and he no longer
suffered from knee pain.
Applicant told the security investigator that he did not disclose his marijuana use
in  his  SCA,  because  he  was  worried  that  it  might  jeopardize  his  security  clearance.
(FORM Item 5 at 2.) His failure to disclose his drug involvement in his SCA is not alleged
in the SOR.
