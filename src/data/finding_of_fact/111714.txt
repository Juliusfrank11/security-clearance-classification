Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.e,  2.a,  3.a,  3.b,  and  3.d-3.g,  although  he  said
that SOR ¶¶ 3.e and 3.f were the same offense. He denied SOR ¶ 3.c. His admissions
are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  44-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  never
married. He has an adult son who lives in another state, an 18-year-old daughter, a 15-
year-old  daughter,  and  a  14-year-old  daughter.  His  three  daughters  live  with  their
mothers. Two of them live in other states. Applicant lives with his girlfriend and her 10-
year-old  son.  (GE  1;  Tr.  25)  Applicant  earned  a  certification  in  1997,  an  associate’s
degree in 2012, and a bachelor’s degree in 2015. (GE 1) He testified that he also has a
master’s degree. (Tr. 25, 58)
Applicant  was  employed  by  an  electronics  company  from  December  2005  to
January  2008.  He  left  the  job  to  take  a  position  in  another  state,  but  the  job  did  not
materialize.  He  was  then  unemployed  for  most  of  the  next  four  and  a  half  years.  He
spent much of this time improving his education. (GE 1; Tr. 67-69) He was employed at
a  computer  company  from  May  to  September  2013,  but  was  terminated  after  a
confrontation  with  a  coworker.  (GE  1;  Tr.  68-70  He  was  then  unemployed  again  until
May 2014, when he briefly took a job caring for seniors. He left the position because he
did not believe the employer was following regulations appropriately. (GE 1; Tr. 71-72)
Since  2017,  Applicant  has  worked  in  information  technology  for  his  current
employer and clearance sponsor. (GE 1, Tr. 72-76) On occasion, he was unemployed
between contracts. (GE 1; Tr. 61-65) He has never held a clearance. (Tr. 13) Applicant
testified that in 2019, he earned between $35,000 and $40,000. He works full time. (Tr.
65-67, 90-93)
In April 1994, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony injury to a child. He
was  convicted  and  served  five  years  in  jail.  (SOR  ¶  3.g)(GE  1  at  43-44)  Applicant
testified that the injuries to the child included bruises and a burn mark. (Tr. 34-35)
In  September  2001,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  third-degree
larceny. (SOR ¶ 3.f) He explained that he was arrested after he attempted to steal some
items of clothing from a department store. He received a period of probation, but failed
to pay the related fine. In March 2003, he was in an auto accident. In the aftermath, he
gave a false name to the police. He was arrested for making a false report and for the
larceny  charge,  due  to  the  unpaid  fine.  He  said  that  his  probation  was  extended  as  a
result. (GE 1 at 44-45; GE 5 at 11; Tr. 26-28, 35-37) (SOR ¶ 3.e)
In 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of
alcohol (DUI) and driving with a suspended license. He was convicted and sentenced to
one  day  in  jail,  12  months  of  probation,  fined,  ordered  to  perform  community  service,
and attend DUI education. (SOR ¶ 3.d) (GE 1 at 45-46; GE 5 at 8-9)
In  January  2012,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  felony  child  abuse.
(SOR ¶ 3.c) (GE 5 at 12; GE 1 at 38) He denied SOR ¶ 3.c. Applicant testified that the
girlfriend  of  his  daughter’s  maternal  grandfather  filed  a  child-abuse  complaint  against
Applicant.  The  complainant,  he  asserted,  was  herself  wanted  for  murder  at  the  time.
Applicant  was  arrested,  as  was  his  daughter’s  mother.  Applicant  denied  that  he
committed the offense. (Tr. 28-31, 37) He participated in parenting classes. (Tr. 34, 81-
83)  He  reported  the  arrest  on  his  SCA  and  noted  that  the  charge  was  dismissed  in
September  2014.  (GE  1  at  38-39)  The  arrest  is  documented  in  Applicant’s  criminal
record, but disposition of the charge is not. (GE 5)
In about June 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with public intoxication
and  resisting  arrest,  and  cited  for  speeding  and  improper  lane  usage.  (SOR  ¶  3.b)  In
October 2013, he pleaded guilty to speeding and public intoxication and was fined. The
resisting  arrest  charge  and  the  citation  for  improper  lane  usage  were  dismissed.
Applicant testified that he was on his way home and a police car going in the opposite
direction  turned  and  followed  him.  He  pulled  into  his  apartment  complex.  When  the
police asked him to exit the vehicle, he tripped over a curb and fell down because the
parking lot was not well lit. (Tr. 37-38) (Answer to SOR; GE 1 at 39-40; Tr. 31-32) The
charges are not detailed on the exhibit documenting Applicant’s criminal record. (GE 5)
In December 2014, Applicant was charged with DUI and also cited for speeding
and improper lane usage. (SOR ¶ 3.a) Applicant admitted the fact that he was charged
but denied the conduct. He testified that he was pulled over because the police officer
observed him swerving between the lanes and smelled liquor on him during the traffic
stop.  Applicant  denied  that  he  consumed  alcohol  that  night.  He  said  had  just  left  the
house,  and  was  “sleepy”  but  not  drunk.  (Tr.  83-85)  In  October  2016,  the  DUI  charge
was nolle prossed after Applicant attended a nine-month DUI class through a diversion
program. (GE 5 at 12; GE 1 at 41-42; Tr. 31-32, 39-40, 76-80, 94) He has not had any
subsequent arrests. (Tr. 40)
Applicant  reported  on  his  SCA  that  he  used  marijuana  weekly,  at  times  daily,
between  May  2003  and  July  2016.  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  His  most  recent  use  was  after  the
sudden  death  of  a  close  friend.  He  said  this  was  shortly  before  he  participated  in  the
DUI  diversion  program.  The  timing  of  his  last  marijuana  use  is  unclear.  Applicant  said
he  had  not  used  marijuana  since  July  2016.  (Tr.  43,  44)  He  later  said  this  was  some
time in 2017. (Tr. 44, 46-47) He denied using marijuana after submitting his May 2017
SCA. (Tr. 46) He acknowledged knowing that marijuana use is against state and federal
law.  He  has  attended  Narcotics  Anonymous  (NA)  a  few  times  in  the  last  three  years.
(Tr. 40-47, 94-98)
Applicant’s background investigation also included credit reports from July 2017,
May 2018, and March 2019. Applicant had five delinquent accounts, the largest by far
being  SOR  ¶  1.a,  concerning  a  $121,692  child  support  arrearage.  SOR  ¶  1.b  is  a
charged-off student loan account for $8,293. SOR ¶ 1.c is another charged-off account
for  $1,755.  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  ($250)  and  1.e  ($76)  are  two  past-due  medical  accounts.
Applicant disclosed his debts on his SCA. (GE 1)
As  to  SOR  ¶  1.a,  Applicant  testified  that  he  fell  behind  on  his  child-support
payments  during  his  periods  of  unemployment.  This  began  with  a  layoff  in  2009.  He
also acknowledged working odd jobs, but said that none of that income went to arrears
or child support. (Tr. 85-90) Applicant testified that his child support went into arrears in
about 2012. (Tr. 100)
Applicant testified that he is currently paying on his child support and has money
taken out of his paycheck regularly. He said the arrearage amount was incurred during
his  various  periods  of  unemployment.  The  child  support  concerns  his  two  younger
children,  one  of  whom  lives  in  his  home  state  and  one  of  whom  is  in  another  state.
Applicant  said  he  is  paying  between  $500  and  $600  in  child  support  monthly  for  one
child,  and  about  $425  for  another  child.  Applicant  does  not  believe  that  his  monthly
payments  address  the  amount  in  arrears.  Applicant  did  not  provide  documentation  of
the current status of his child-support payments. (Tr. 47-54, 99-104)
Applicant asserted that his student loan (SOR ¶ 1.b) is in deferment. He said he
has  other  student  loans,  which  are  also  deferred.  (Tr.  54-55,  58-61)  Applicant  did  not
provide documentation of the current status of his past-due student loan. The past-due
debt at SOR ¶ 1.c is also unresolved. (Tr. 105)
Applicant asserted that the two medical debts alleged (SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e) are
co-payments from medical procedures. He believes they should have been covered by
insurance. (Tr. 55-56) They remain unresolved.
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
Supreme  Court  has  held,  “the  clearly  consistent  standard  indicates  that  security
