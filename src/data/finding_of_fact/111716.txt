Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations, with explanations. His admissions are
incorporated  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence,  I  make
the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  56-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  has  worked  for
this  employer  for  approximately  two  years.  He  is  a  high  school  graduate  and  has
completed two years of college. He has been married for 39 years. He has three adult
children.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  Air  Force  from  1982  to  1987  and  was
honorably discharged. (Tr. 6, 16-18; GE 1)
The SOR alleged Applicant failed to timely file his federal tax returns for tax years
2010,  2011,  and  2012,  and  that  he  owes  the  IRS  for  unpaid  taxes  in  the  approximate
amount of $24,712 for tax years 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and  2017 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.h).
The  allegations  are  supported  by  admissions  in  his  trustworthiness  application,  his
answers to interrogatives, his federal tax transcripts from 2010 to 2017, and admissions
in his SOR answer. (GE 1-3; Ans.)
Applicant  attributed  his  tax  problems  to  the  time  when  he  owned  his  own
business.  He  testified  that  he  owned  and  operated  an  auto  body  repair  business  from
2006 or 2007 until 2009 when he reported on his trustworthiness application (TA) and in
January  2018,  during  his  background  interview  (BI)  that  his  business  operated  from
April 2009 to February 2011. When he owned his business, he claimed that he hired an
accountant to prepare his taxes. He did not remember the name of the accountant. He
claims he provided the accountant the necessary documents to file his tax returns and
also  gave  him  money  to  pay  the  taxes.  Applicant  believes  that  the  accountant
absconded with the funds. He went to the accountant’s office in 2010 and found it empty
with  the  telephone  disconnected.  His  2010  federal  tax  return  was  not  filed  by  the
accountant. He knows he owes on his federal taxes, but he does not know the amount.
(Tr. 19-20, 23-24; GE 1-2)
After  Applicant  closed  his  business  in  2011,  he  worked  as  a  truck  driver  for
various companies until beginning his current employment in November 2017. Applicant
does not know why he did not timely file his 2011 and 2012 federal returns.  In October
2018,  Applicant  hired  an  accountant  who  is  a  licensed  IRS  enrolled  agent  (Agent)  to
resolve  his  tax  issues.  The  Agent  testified  that  Applicant  owed  the  IRS  approximately
$176,000  for  unpaid  back  federal  taxes.  He  further  testified  that  90  percent  of  the  tax
debt was attributed to Applicant’s business in 2009. The Agent filed Applicant’s federal
returns  for  years  2010  through  2012  sometime  in  2019  (IRS  tax  transcripts  for  years
2010  and  2011  indicate  that  as  of  June  2019,  no  returns  were filed. The  transcript for
year  2012  indicates  the  return  was  filed  in  February  2019).  Tax  transcripts  for  years
2013-2017 show that Applicant owes unpaid taxes for each of those years. The Agent
testified that all Applicant’s federal returns have now been filed. (Tr. 23, 28, 30-31, 33-
36, 38; GE 3)
The  Agent  testified  that  he  has  been  negotiating  with  the  IRS  since  December
2018, to reach an offer-in-compromise to enable Applicant to begin paying his tax debt.
The  current  offer  would  reduce  Applicant’s  tax  debt  to  approximately  $25,000.  This
amount  could  be  paid  over  24  months.  Applicant  submitted  a  post-hearing  document
showing  that  the  IRS  agreed  to  further  reduce  the  offer-in-compromise  amount  to
$10,486.  Applicant  and  his  wife  agreed  to  the  new  terms  on  January  8,  2020.  The
payment terms were as follows: $152 already paid; $1,944 payable with the sending of
the  signed  offer-in-compromise  addendum  form  (no  payment  documentation  was
provided);  $1,677  due  one  month  after  acceptance  of  the  addendum;  $6,711  due  five
months  after  acceptance  of  the  addendum.  Applicant  currently  lives  paycheck  to
paycheck  and  is  having  his  wages  garnished  to  pay  for  delinquent  student  loans.  If
Applicant  misses  a  payment  under  the  offer-in-compromise,  the  agreement  can  be
voided. (Tr. 38-41, 45; AE A-B; Ans.)
Applicant offered five personal reference letters from coworkers, supervisors, and
personal friends. His coworkers and supervisors described him as highly professional, a
strong  team  leader,  and  trustworthy.  His  personal  references  noted  his  loyalty,
dedication, helpfulness, and trustworthiness. (AE C)
Other  than  seeking  assistance  with  his  tax  problem,  Applicant  has  not  sought
financial counseling and did not present evidence of a budget. (Tr. 29)
