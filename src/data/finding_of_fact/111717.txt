Applicant  is  a  44-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance  for  the  first  time.  She  works  as  a  background  investigator for  a  company  in
the defense industry. She has been so employed since September 2018. (Tr. 45) She
earned  an  associate  degree  in  1995,  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  business  administration
and  management  in  1997,  and  a  master’s  degree  in  business  management  in  2000.
She is married and has three children, the first born in 2000 and twins born in 2005. Her
husband  was  self-employed  in  the  plumbing  business  until 2018,  when he accepted a
job with a municipality.
Before her current job, Applicant’s employment history  was  a bit inconsistent or
uneven. She worked as a master scheduler for a company during 2006-2011, when she
departed due to the demands of raising twins. For the next several years she worked,
without  monetary  compensation,  as  the  office  manager  for  her  husband’s  plumbing
business.  Her  hours  were  irregular,  perhaps  ten  hours  weekly.  During  this  time,  she
decided to pursue a career in education as a teacher. She enrolled in a local university
to obtain a teacher’s certificate. She financed her attendance with two student loans in
the amounts of $9,000, loan date 09/01/2015, and $12,500, loan date 10/28/2014, for a
total of $21,500. (Exhibit L at 4)
After Applicant obtained a teacher’s certificate, she was unable to find a full-time
job  teaching.  She  worked  part-time  as  a  substitute  teacher for  the  local  school district
during 2013-2018 earning about $60 daily. (Tr. 32, 45) The income was not sufficient to
allow  her  to  maintain  regular  payments  on  her  student  loans,  and  she  eventually
defaulted. Per credit reports from 2018 and 2019, the loans had outstanding balances of
$5,385 and $15,773, for a total of $21,158, when  placed for collection. (Exhibits 2 and
3)
The  SOR  alleged  and  Applicant  admitted  a  history  of  financial  problems.  In
addition  to  her  admissions,  factual  allegations  in  the  SOR  are  established  by  the
documentary  evidence.  (Exhibits  2-4)  The  SOR  concerns  the  two  student  loans
mentioned above now in collection and two medical collection accounts in the amounts
of $1,186 and $295.
Both student loans are in collection with the same creditor. (Exhibits A, B, C, D,
G,  H,  I,  and  L)  The  balance  on  the  account  as  of  September  20,  2019,  was  $17,497.
The  outstanding  balance  was  reduced  substantially  in  April  2019,  when  a  federal
income  tax  refund  of  $6,365  was  applied.  Applicant  entered  into  a  payment
arrangement with the creditor in about May 2019, when she agreed to make  a monthly
payment, initially $366 and then reduced to $143, beginning in June 2019, and she has
made the payments as agreed.
Both  medical  collection  accounts  are  in  collection  with  the  same  creditor.
(Exhibits E, F, G, H, I, and L) The accounts stem from emergency-room visits in 2012
and 2013. The balance on the account as of September 19, 2019, was $986. Applicant
entered  into  a  payment  arrangement  with  the  creditor  in  about  May  2019,  when  she
agreed  to  make  12  monthly  payments  of  $124  beginning  in  June  2019,  and  she  has
made the payments as agreed.
Applicant attributed her delinquent debts to financial hardship brought about by a
lack of income after she left her job as a master scheduler in 2011 in order to attend to
family responsibilities. (Tr. 43; Answer to SOR) Her husband’s plumbing business and
her part-time work as a substitute teacher did not generate enough income to meet all
their  financial  obligations.  In  addition,  her  ability  to  repay  the  delinquent  debts  was
affected by expensive dental care incurred in 2019. (Exhibit K)
Applicant’s  overall  financial  situation  has  stabilized.  A  written  budget  she
prepared  reflects  a  positive  net  monthly  remainder  of  about  $396.  (Exhibit  J)  Her
husband is now a salaried employee earning about $54,000 annually. (Tr. 47-50) She is
paid  hourly  and  quarterly  bonus  pay.  She  estimated  her  2019  gross  income  at  about
$42,000. (Tr. 47-50) In addition, their financial assets consist of retirement accounts and
about $133,000 in home equity. (Tr. 51-54)
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the  burden  of  proof  is  less  than  a  preponderance  of  evidence.3  The  DOHA  Appeal
Board  has  followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s findings  of  fact  are  reviewed
under the substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.6
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,

unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;
AG  ¶  20(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  a  death,  divorce,  or
separation,  clear  victimization  by  predatory  lending  practices,  or  identity
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.  The
disqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.
Turning  to  the  matters  in  mitigation,  Applicant’s  financial  problems  are  due  to
underemployment  and  unemployment,  which,  combined  with  her  husband’s  irregular
income  as  a  self-employed  plumber,  resulted  in  financial  hardship.  She  acted
responsibly  under the circumstances,  as  shown  by  her  remedial  actions  in  addressing
the  student  loans  and  the  medical  collection  accounts.  Given  the  circumstances,  the
mitigating condition at AG ¶ 20(b) applies in Applicant’s favor.
Applicant  made  a  good-faith  effort  to  resolve  her  delinquent  financial  accounts.
She  receives  credit  for  entering  into  repayment  arrangements  with  the  creditor for  the
student  loans  and  the  creditor  for  the  medical  collection  accounts.  She  is  making
progress in repaying the student loans and will pay off the medical collection accounts
over  the  course  of  12  monthly  payments.  Given  the  circumstances,  the  mitigating
condition at AG ¶ 20(d) applies in Applicant’s favor.
Applicant presented a good but less than perfect case in mitigation, but, as in all
human  affairs,  perfection  is  not  the  standard.  A  security  clearance  case  is not  a  debt-
collection  procedure.  It  is  a  procedure  designed  to  evaluate  an  applicant’s  judgment,
reliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010).
An  applicant  is  not  required,  as  a  matter  of  law,  to  establish  resolution  of  every  debt
alleged  in  the  SOR.  An  applicant  need  only  establish  a  plan  to  resolve  the  financial
problems  and  take  significant  actions  to  implement  the  plan.  There  is  no  requirement
that  an  applicant  make  payments  on  all  the  delinquent  debts  simultaneously,  nor  is
there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No.
07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).
Here, I am persuaded that Applicant is making an honest effort to be financially
responsible  and  repay  her  creditors.  There  are  clear  indications  that  her  financial
problems are under control. Her overall financial situation has improved with the benefit
of her full-time employment and her husband’s regular income as a salaried employee.
It  is  probable  that  she  will  continue  to  make  the  agreed  upon  monthly  payments  and
resolve  outstanding  debts.  Taking  everything  into  account,  Applicant  demonstrated
good
trustworthiness  by  persevering  under  difficult
circumstances. The financial considerations concern is mitigated.
reliability,  and
judgment,
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent  standard,  I  have  no  doubts  about
Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or
sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence  as  a  whole
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or  vice
versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that she met her ultimate
burden  of  persuasion  to  show  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to
grant her eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:
For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:
For Applicant
Conclusion
It  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  interests  of  national  security  to  grant  Applicant
eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility granted.
