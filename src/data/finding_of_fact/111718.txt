Applicant, age 54, has never married nor has any children. He cohabited with his
girlfriend from 1995 until she passed away in 2017. He earned his Bachelor of Science
degree  from  a  maritime  academy  in  1987.  He  served  honorably  in  the  U.S.  Naval
Merchant  Marine  Reserves  from  1987  until  1995.  Since  at  least  2007,  he  has  worked
aboard  U.S.  military  vessels  as  a  contractor  for  various  employers.  He  has  been
employed  full  time  as  a  second  mate  by  the  same  defense  contractor  since  February
2013.  He  previously  held  a  DOD  security  clearance  from  approximately  2001  through
2011.
Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns, as required,
for at least tax years 2008 through 2017. In each of those tax years, he filed extensions.
The  status  of  his  returns  or  extensions  for  tax  year  2018  was  not  addressed  in  the
record. While he attributed his filing delays primarily to being underway and overseas as
a  merchant  seaman  for  large  periods  of  time,  he  also  acknowledged  that  his
procrastination played a role. Since at least November 2009, Applicant has lived aboard
the vessels on a schedule of between two to four months on and two to four months off.
As  of  September  2019,  he  had  been  working  the  latter.  During  his  off  periods,  he
attends trainings. (Item 1; Item 3 at 7, 9-10)
Applicant filed his 2008 and 2009 federal and state returns in October 2013. For
those tax years, he did not owe any federal taxes, and paid the $15,000 state taxes that
he owed by credit card. For tax years 2010 through 2017, he does not anticipate owing
any  federal  taxes  due  to  having  the  maximum  federal  taxes  withheld  from  his
paychecks.  However,  because  he  does  not  have  state  taxes  withheld  from  his
paychecks,  he  anticipates  that  he  will  owe  state  taxes.  He  will  not  know  the  amounts
due  until  he  files  his  returns.  He  proffered  that  he  is  willing  and  able  to  pay  any  state
taxes owed, assuming that he is able to negotiate a monthly repayment plan. His future
intent is to timely file his returns and pay his taxes. (Item 3 at 9-10, 11)
During his September 2017 security clearance interview, Applicant asserted that
he  had  sought  the  assistance  of  an  accounting  firm  to  file  his  2010  through  2017
returns. At that time, he anticipated that the returns would be filed by the end of 2018.
He also explained that he had been busy “handling details and business aspects” of his
girlfriend’s  estate  following  her  death  in  “recent  months.” In  his  July  2019  response  to
interrogatories, Applicant acknowledged that his returns had not yet been filed. He had
not been able to gather the documents required by the accounting firm due, in part, to
the  grief  he  experienced  because  of  his  girlfriend’s  death  and,  in  part,  to  his  work
schedule. He had been on a vessel since May 1, 2019 and anticipated that he would file
the returns once he returned home. (Item 3 at 4-6, 9-10)
In his September 2019 SOR response, Applicant acknowledged that his  returns
remained  unfiled.  He  reiterated  that  his  girlfriend’s  passing  and  work  schedule
continued to impact his ability to file his delinquent returns. However, he also admitted
that  he  did  not  “fully  understand”  until  he  received  the  SOR  that  him  “not  filing  taxes”
was influencing the decision as to whether or not to grant him a security clearance. He
asked  for  more  time  to  file  his  returns.  While  he  did  not  specify  a  timeframe,  he
anticipated that they would be filed “within a reasonable amount of time.” (Item 1)
Applicant  was  involuntarily  unemployed  from  January  2012  through  February
2013,  during  which  time  he  supported  himself  through  savings  and  unemployment
compensation.  Before  her  passing,  his  girlfriend  assisted  Applicant  in  managing  his
finances  while  he  was  on  the  vessels.  Applicant’s  employment  income  consists  of  an
unspecified bi-weekly salary paid while he is on the vessel, plus an additional $10,000
to  $12,000  paid  after he  is off  the  vessel as  a  payout  of  benefits. In  September 2017,
Applicant reported that he had approximately $40,000 in credit-card debt, including the
$15,000 he charged in October 2013 to pay his 2008 and 2009 state taxes. His October
2019  credit  report  revealed  no  delinquent  debts  and  that  he  was  paying  the  monthly
payments as agreed on eight credit-card accounts with balances totaling $55,093. (Item
1; Item 3 at 8, 10-11; Item 4)
