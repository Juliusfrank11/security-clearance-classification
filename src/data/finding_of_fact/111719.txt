Applicant  is  a  60-year-old  communications  specialist  who  has  worked  in  the
same  position  since  mid-2017.  He  completed  some  postsecondary  coursework  in  the
past  decade.  He  honorably  served on  active  duty in  the  U.S.  military  from  1979-1983,
then again from 1987-2003, before accepting a position as a contractor serving with the
U.S. military. Applicant married in 2003 and has two children in their early teens. He first
was  awarded  a  security  clearance  while  serving in  the  military.  He  has  held  a  security
clearance without adverse incident.
In  late  2017,  Applicant  discovered  his  wife  had  a  gambling  problem,  expending
about  $7,000  that  preceding  year.  (FORM,  Item  4  at  1)  As  a  contractor,  Applicant’s
salary was affected each time a new company won his employment contract. Each time,
this resulted in a pay reduction. His salary was thus reduced by over $23,000 in the past
decade. (Response to FORM, at 2)
At issue in the SOR are four financial situation:
First (1.a), is a charged-off account for approximately $12,712 for an automotive
debt  which  arose  after  Applicant’s  2010  bankruptcy  petition.  Applicant’s  credit  report
notes  a  date  of  last  activity  on  this  account  as  October  2017.  (FORM,  Item  4)  In  May
2019,  Applicant  negotiated  a  payment  plan  on  this  balance.  After  his  third  timely
payment plan, he satisfied the debt balance in August 2019. (AE 1, 1-2) This debt was
resolved  and  SATISFIED  with  the  help  of  funds  received  from  a  bank  settlement.  (AE
1a, 2; 1b)
Second  (1.b)  and  third  (1.c),  are  student  loan  collection  accounts  for  about
$28,660 and $22,253, respectively. They predate his 2011 bankruptcy petition, survived
that  action,  and  then  were  forgotten  or  overlooked.  They  have  been  rehabilitated  and
are  now  subject  to  a  regular  repayment  plan.  Evidence  of  the  established  repayment
plan  and  regular  payments  started  in  July  2019  were  presented.  (AE  2)  IN
REPAYMENT
Fourth  (1.d),  in  September  2010,  Applicant  filed  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy
protection  and  claimed  approximately  $481,180  in  outstanding  liabilities.  He  attributed
his  need  for  bankruptcy  largely  to  “various  and  cumulative  issues.”  (FORM,  Item  3,
Personal Interview at 4, 8) Specifically, he cited to a poor choice in financing his home
with an Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) in 2005, and a subsequent, rapid increase in
mortgage  payments.  In  addition,  he  also  cited  to  an  estimated  $20,000  salary  cut  he
took  to  stay  on  his  employment  contract.  (FORM,  Item  3,  Personal  Interview  at  4,  8)
That bankruptcy was discharged in around January 2011. Elsewhere, he mentioned his
wife had had a gaming problem.
Today, Applicant is living within his means and his salary is stable. There are no
other  delinquent  debts  at  issue.  His  student  loan  payments  are  reasonable  and
manageable. He is contrite that the delinquent debts at issue were not previously noted
and  honored.  Applicant  is  proud  to  be  continuing  to  serve  in  furtherance  of  the  U.S.
government and military.
