In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR  Applicant  admitted  the  factual  allegation  in
Subparagraph  1.a.  of  the  SOR,  with  explanations.  He  also  provided  additional
information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.
Applicant is 37 years old, is married, and works for a defense contractor. (TR at
page 15 line 18 to page 20 line 13.) It is unclear when Applicant was granted a security

However,  he  admits  the  allegation  that  he  used  marijuana  “while  granted  access  to
classified  information.”  Furthermore,  in  his  e-QIP  Applicant  avers  he  has  worked  for
“Federal Contractor(s)” since April of 2011. (GX 1 at pages 12~15.)
