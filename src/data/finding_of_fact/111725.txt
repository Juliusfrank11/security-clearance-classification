The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  owes  two  delinquent  credit  card  debts  totaling
$29,107  (SOR  1.a,  1.b).  He  admitted  both  allegations  with  explanations.  His  original
intention was to let both credit card accounts remain in default during the running of the
state  statute  of  limitations.  After  the  statute  expired,  the  accounts  would  be  removed
from  his  credit  report  and  become  uncollectible. When  Applicant  received  the  SOR  in
May 2019, he took action to pay back the debts. (May 2019 answer to SOR)
Applicant  is  44  years  old.  In  May  1999,  he  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in
journalism. In the same month and year, he began serving on active duty in the United
State  Army  (USA).  He  received  an  honorable  discharge  in  September  2004.  He  has
owned his own home since 2007. He married in 2011 and has a five-year-old daughter.
He has had a security clearance since 1994. (GE 1 at 9-10, 25 44; GE 2 at 7; Tr. 9)
Between  2004  and  2007,  Applicant  was  working  in  security-related  intelligence
positions.  Since  2007,  he  has  held  positions  related  to  information  technology  (IT).  In
his  current  job  that  he  began  in  March  2019,  he  manages  a  website  for  a  federal
government agency. (GE 1 at 12- 22; May 2019 answer to SOR; AE C; Tr. 8-9)
Before  Applicant’s  current  employment,  he  was  unemployed  in  February  2019,
after working in a 1099 temporary position from November 2018 to February 2019. The
unemployment  occurred  when  the  temporary  contract  ended.  (GE  1  at  12-  22;  May
2019 answer to SOR; AE C; Tr. 8-9)
Applicant’s  unemployment  between  June  and  July  2017  was  due  to  leaving  his
previous  job  (January  to  June  2017)  by  mutual  agreement  after  receiving  a  notice  of
unsatisfactory  performance.  Applicant  was  not  completely  qualified  for  his  job  and  his
client was difficult to work for.  During the early part of this employment, Applicant took
two recreational trips out of the United States. Each trip lasted up to five days. (GE 1 at
12-22, 37-40; GE 2 at 4-5; May 2019 answer to SOR)
Applicant’s  unemployment  from  September  2014  to  March  2015  occurred  when
his  previous  employment  contract  ended.  In his  previous  job,  a  1099  position,  he  was
employed  from  August  2013  to  September  2014.  In  March  2014,  Applicant  took  a
recreational trip out of the United States. The trip lasted up to five days. (GE 1 at 12- 22,
37-40; May 2019 answer to SOR; AE C; AE D at 9-10; Tr. 8-9)
from  April
Applicant’s  unemployment
to  his
unanticipated  release  from  a  contract after  working  for  an  employer  from  May  2012  to
April 2013. His supervisor was asking him to do work that he did not know how to do,
and  the  supervisor  could  not  find  Applicant  another  suitable  position.  In  September
2012,  Applicant  took  a  recreational  trip  out  of  the  United  States.  The  trip  lasted  up  to
five days. (GE 1 at 12- 22, 37-40; May 2019 answer to SOR; AE C; Tr. 8-9)
to  August  2013  was  due
SOR 1.a and 1.b – These two accounts are credit cards that Applicant opened in
2004.  He  used  the  cards  to  purchase  items  for  his  house  and  child.  Applicant  was
aware that both credit cards became delinquent by January 2014 because he could not
maintain  the  payments.  The  collection  agency  contacted  him  on  a  weekly  basis  for
payment until the middle of 2016 when they stopped. (GE 2 at 8; GE 3 at 2)
Applicant informed the OPM investigator in his April 2018 PSI that the two credit
card  debts  (SOR  1.a,  1.b)  became  delinquent  during  his  unemployment  in  December
2013 and January 2014. I find the OPM investigator misunderstood him because when
Applicant discussed his unemployment in an earlier part of the  PSI, he did not mention
that  he  was  unemployed  in  December  2013 or  January  2014.  His  September  2017  e-
QIP, his May 2019 answer to the SOR, and his resume indicate that he was working as
a  1099  employee  for  a  medical  health  agency  between  August  2013  and  September
2014. I find that Applicant was referring generally to the overall negative impact that the
occasional unemployment was having on his bill-paying ability. (GE 1 at 16; GE 2 at 8-
9; AE C at 2)
Regarding  his  intentions  of  avoiding  similar  financial  problems  in  the  future,
Applicant indicated in his April 2018 PSI that he intended to repay all his debts, but was
unable  to  state  when.  He  planned  on  “spending  less  and  saving  more.”  During  the
period  after  his  April  2018  PSI,  and  before  he  filed his  May  2019  answer  to  the  SOR,
Applicant changed his mind and decided not to repay the listed debts, opting to wait on
the state statute of limitations to run so that the debts would be removed from his credit
report. In his answer to the SOR, he decided to address the two debts.  At the October
2019 hearing, Applicant testified that his plan was “to pay off all debts and aggressively
start saving.” (GE 2 at 9; Tr. 35; May 2019 answer to SOR)
Attached  to  his  May  2019  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  explained  that  he
received  financial advice  from  his  facility  security  officer  (FSO)  and a  financial  advisor
about  how  to  address  the  two  listed  debts. Based  on  that  advice,  Applicant  contacted
the creditor in SOR 1.a and 1.b between May 16 and May 21, 2019, and negotiated a
settlement  of  each  debt  and  corresponding  payment  plans.  The  combined  settlement
amount  is  $8,592.  This  was  the  first  documented  time  that  Applicant  contacted  the
creditor  to  discuss  settlement  even  though  he  knew  the  delinquent  status of  the  debts
since  at  least  2014.  He  has  made  regular  monthly  payments  from  June  through
September  2019.  Both  debts  are  scheduled  to  be  paid  off  by  May  2020.  (May  2019
answer to SOR; AE A; AE D at 15-20)
The  financial  adviser  provided  recommendations  on  how  Applicant  could  repair
his credit. No further information was provided. Applicant has had no additional financial
counseling  other  than  the  information  he  supplied  in  his  answer  to  the  SOR  in  May
2019. He does not utilize a written budget in managing his finances. Instead, Applicant
keeps  a  mental  budget  because  he  knows  what  the  monthly  expenses  will  be.  He
retains  $200  for  personal  expenses  out  of  his  bi-monthly  paychecks  for  unforeseen
expenses. Based on the figures Applicant provided, his take home pay is about $7,000
a  month  and  his  expenses,  including  payments  to  the  two  creditors  and  the  Internal
Revenue Service (IRS), amount to $5,150, leaving a discretionary monthly remainder of
$1,850. However, Applicant believed his monthly remainder was $500 to $600.  He has
$2,000 in his checking account and $1,500 in his savings account. (May 2019 answer to
the SOR at 3-4; Tr. 25-31, 32, 36)
Though  unalleged  in  the  SOR,  the  Government  asked  Applicant  whether  he
owed federal or state taxes. He replied that he owes federal taxes of at least $18,000.
He explained that the delinquent taxes occurred because he did not report his taxable
income  as  a  1099  employee in 2013  and  2014.  Even  though  he  was  employed  in  the
position for more than a year, and was 38 years old during this employment, he claimed
that  he  did  not  know  the  quarterly  tax  filing  requirements  for  a  1099  employee.  In
documentation  prepared  by  the  IRS,  dated  October  3,  2019,  Applicant  owes
approximately  $4,583  for  federal  tax  year  2014.  He  contended  that  regular  monthly
payments  of  $300  since  2014  reduced  the  original  amount  of  $19,714  to  $4,583.  His
documentation  reflects  that  he  has  been  paying  the  tax  debt  since  October  2018.
Applicant could have presented his bank records to show proof of payment  to the IRS
during all or part of the period before October 2018.  Applicant paid the corresponding,
delinquent state taxes due for 2013 and 2014, in periodic payments over an eight-month
period ending in December 2014. (GE 2 at 7; AE D at 2-3, 5-8; Tr. 36-38)
Applicant  filed  his  2018  W-2  Form  with  an  erroneous  notation  that  he  was
exempt from federal taxes for the year. As a result, he owes additional federal taxes of
$14,488  for  federal  tax  year  2018.  The  combined  total  of  delinquent  federal  taxes  for
federal tax years 2014 and 2018 is $19,079. In May 2019, his payments were increased
to $500 a month to account for the additional delinquent taxes owed for tax year 2018.
Applicant’s IRS tax issues will be addressed in the discussion under the whole-person
concept. (AE D at 2-3, 5-8; Tr. 36-38)
Applicant  provided  no  character evidence regarding  his  performance  on  the  job
or his reputation in the community where he lives.
