Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  63  years  old,  married,  and  has  3  adult  children.  He  received  a
bachelor’s degree in 2004, and served in the military from 1974 to 1979, at which time he
was honorably discharged. (Item 3)
Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in July 2017. During
his April 2018 background interview with a Government investigator, he was asked if he
had failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other tax returns when required by law. Applicant
admitted to the investigator that he failed to file and pay his taxes from 2014 to 2017. He
stated that his reason for failing to do so was because he was having difficulty with his
wife’s Social Security Disability payments and the fact that taxes were not being withheld
from the payments. He told the government investigator that in addition to owing Federal
taxes, he also owed state taxes to State A, and possibly State B. He indicated he was
seeking  assistance  from  a  tax  preparer  to  rectify  the  situation.  (I  will  not  consider  any
derogatory  information  that  was  not  alleged.  I  may  consider  it  when  applying  the
mitigating conditions, making a credibility determination, and applying the whole-person
concept.) (Items 2, 4)
Applicant completed government interrogatories in May 2019. He indicated in them
that he filed his 2013, 2014, and 2015 Federal income tax returns on February 25, 2019.
He indicated that he filed his 2016 and 2017 Federal income tax returns on May 5, 2019.
He stated he filed an extension request for his 2018 Federal tax returns, and they were
filed by October 15, 2019. (Item 4)
Applicant also stated in his answer to Government interrogatories that he filed his
2013,  2014,  2015,  2016,  and  2017  State  A  income  tax  returns  on  February  25,  2019.
Because  he  also  worked  in  State  B  in  2013,  2014,  and  2015,  he  was  required  to  file
income tax returns with that state. He failed to do so timely and filed them on February
25, 2019. He did not work in State B other tax years. (Item 2)
In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  stated  the  reason  he  failed  to  timely  his
Federal  and  State  A  and  B  income  tax  returns  was  because  “I  got  stupid  then
overwhelmed.” (Item 2)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he provided proof that he paid his 2013 Federal
tax debt in June 2019 ($3,415). He stated: “I am caught up on Federal Taxes.” (Item 2)
In his Response to the FORM, he provided Internal Revenue Service transcripts showing
he has zero balances owed for tax years 2013 through 2018. He stated in his Response
the following: “The reason for being late is large medical bills due to wife’s illness. And
long wait for getting her on disability.” (AE A) No other information was provided regarding
how these facts impacted his ability to file his tax returns. (Item 2, AE A, G)
Applicant  provided  a  copy  of  an  installment  agreement  he  has  with  State  A
executed in May 2019. It shows he owes a balance for tax year 2015 to State A of $5,034.
The agreement requires him to pay $152 a month beginning in June 2019 and completing
the agreement in May 2022. He provided proof he made a payment to State A for $170
in June 2019. He also provided a “Certificate of Tax Clearance” from State B dated June
2019 to show “tax clearance valid through 09/22/2019.” (AE G)
Applicant provided exhibits documenting his military service and accomplishments
during  that  period.  He  provided  copies  of  performance  appraisals; his resume and  job
history, and an Internet article on financial issues. (AE B, C, D, E, F, H)
