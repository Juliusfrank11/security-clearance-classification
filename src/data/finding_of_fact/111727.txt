In Applicant’s answer to the SOR he admitted his tax filings had been delayed and
his  Federal  student  loan  (NAVIENT)  had  been  charged  off.  He  denied  two  collection
accounts,  but  later  admitted  that  the  debt  in  SOR  1.d  had  been  charged  off.  (SOR
Responses) After a thorough review of the testimony, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  34-year-old  electrician  who  has  worked  for  a  defense  contractor
since July 2018 and seeks to obtain a security clearance. (Ex. 2, Tr. 16) In April 2013,
Applicant married. He and his spouse have two children ages 1 and 6. (Ex. 1, Tr. 18) He
has  not  served  in  the  military.  (Tr.  17)  His  wife  is  an  entrepreneur  and  has  done  web
design for multiple companies. (Tr. 20) His salary last year was $53,000, and his salary
is  currently  $67,000  annually.  (Tr.  23,  56)  Last  year  he  received  a  three-percent  raise
based on his performance. In August 2020, at his two-year point with his employer, he
anticipates his annual salary will increase to $85,000. (Tr. 24)
Applicant’s wife started a digital company, which she still owns, and opened a juice
bar. (Tr. 20) The juice bar has not been operating for the past six months. (Tr. 31) Sales
stopped  in  July  2019.  (Tr.  34)  She  is  attempting  to  sell  the  brick  and  mortar  brewery
space. (Tr. 30) His wife is not working as much as she had previously done. (Tr. 23)
Applicant was a joint owner on the business. He could not file his individual taxes
until  the  business  taxes  were  filed.  (Tr.  27)  His  wife,  who  handled  their  tax  matters,
needed  an  accountant  to  prepare  the  business  returns.  Applicant’s  Federal  and  state
income tax returns for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017 went unfiled as she searched for
an accountant. (Tr. 20) It took four years before they could locate an accountant. In June
2018, his wife hired an accountant. (Tr. 32) During that time Applicant and his wife moved
from the northeastern United States, to their current location. His wife handled all matters
related to their taxes. (Tr. 33) In August 2018, Applicant sold his home in the northeast.
(Tr. 20) After the sale, they had sufficient funds to pay an accountant. (Tr. 20) With the
funds from the home sale, Applicant paid the accountant’s fee, paid their business taxes,
made  past-due  payments  of  $6,000  on  his  student  loans,  and  had  sufficient  funds
remaining to relocate to their new location. (Tr. 20, 22)
In  Applicant’s  July  26,  2018  Electronic  Questionnaires  for  Investigations
Processing (e-QIP), he admitted he had not filed his state or Federal income tax returns
for tax year 2015, 2016, and 2017. He stated family issues prevented him from filing his
returns and also that he had hired an accountant to help him file his tax returns. (Ex. 1,
Tr. 28) In 2015, his mother had been injured at work. (Tr. 29) His mother’s injury distracted
him from giving priority to his tax matters.
Applicant had two student loan obligations. One was a charged-off private student
loan (SOR  1.d)  and the other  was  a  Federal student  loan (SOR  1.b). In  his  e-QIP,  he
admitted  owing  $25,000  in  student  loans  debts  (SOR  1.b).  The  loans  were  obtained
starting in November 2003, when he started attending college. The loans became past
due when he had been unable to obtain a job that paid sufficient income to pay his student
loans. (Ex. 1) At the time, he was making $410 a week as an electrician. (Tr. 29) As of
his person subject interview with an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM), Applicant was attempting to locate the current holder of the private
student loan so that he could contact the correct agency.
The SOR lists a $25,083 collection debt (SOR 1.d). The debt had apparently been
charged off. Department Counsel stated the collection debt and the charged-off debt were
the same debt. (Tr. 11) This debt was a private student loan. In May 2019, the creditor
cancelled the debt and issued an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1099-C form. The
amount of debt discharged was $19,638. (Ex. E)
Applicant’s Federal student loans (SOR 1.b) had become delinquent because he
was  working  in  a  position  that  provided  insufficient  income  to  make  his  monthly  loan
payments. (Ex. 2, Tr. 7) He now has a better job and lives in a lower cost of living area,
he  is  able  to  pay  his  student  loans.  (Ex.  2)  In  August  2018,  after  selling  his  previous
residence,  he  used  $6,000  from  the  sale  to  bring  his  student  loans  current.  (Ex.  2)  In
August  2018,  he  started  making  monthly  payments  on  his  student  loans  by  automatic
withdrawal. (Tr. 41) Since August 2018, he has made timely payments of $675 monthly.
(Ex.  B,  Tr.  40  -  42)  His  Federal  student  loans  are  currently  in  forbearance,  but  he
continues to make his monthly payments. (Tr. 22) Applicant’s January 2020 credit report
lists these loans as simply “open.” (Ex. C) Some of the loans had previously been past
due, but none of the loans were delinquent or past due since August 2018. (Ex. C)
In November 2018, when Applicant was interviewed by the OPM, he indicated his
mother had been injured on the job in 2015, and he was helping his mother get to her
medical appointments and helping her with legal matters related to her injury. (Ex. 2) He
gave  priority  to  assisting his  mother  and  failed  to  file  his  tax  returns for 2015.  He  filed
extensions of the tax filing deadline for tax years 2016 and 2017, but did not file his returns
during the extension period. (Ex. 2)
Applicant’s 2015 Federal tax return was due in April 2016. The return was filed on
April 7, 2019. He was issued a refund of $481. (Ex. A, SOR Response, Tr. 6) His 2016
Federal  tax  return  was  due  in  April  2017,  but  was  also  filed  on  April  7,  2019.  He  was
issued a $1,267 refund. (Ex. A, Tr. 6) His 2017 Federal tax return was due in April 2018,
but  was  not  filed  until  July  1,  2019.  He  was  issued  a  $2,653  refund.  (Ex.  A,  SOR
Response, Tr. 6) For tax year 2018 he received a $2,080 refund and for tax year 2014,
he received a refund of $1,165. (Ex. A). These two tax years are not listed as a concern
in the SOR, but are included to show his returns have been filed and refunds issued. In
2019, once the business taxes had been filed, he filed his state and Federal tax returns
for 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. (Tr. 28, 31) He paid $10,000 in past-due state taxes. (Tr.
51) The current balance of his state taxes for tax years  2015, 2016, and 2017 is zero.
(Ex. D) His state tax returns and all of his Federal tax returns in question, except for his
tax return for tax year 2017, were filed before the SOR was issued. Although his 2017
returns were in the process of being prepared by their accountant, they were filed two
weeks after the date of the SOR. (Ex. A)
The  SOR  lists  a  $135  collection  account  (SOR  1.c).  The  debt  was  for  cable
equipment,  which  Applicant  asserts  he  returned  the  equipment  and  paid  the  amount
owed. The debt does not appear on his current credit report. (Ex. C) He failed to obtain a
receipt when he returned the equipment. (Tr. 22)
On the 5th day of each month, Applicant and his wife address their bills. (Tr. 37)
They make sure their monthly $1,298 mortgage payment, their utility bills, and their loan
payments for their two vehicles are made. (Tr. 38) Their vehicle payments and automobile
insurance are paid through an automatic deduction. Applicant commutes 120 miles daily
to work, and was paying $150 per week for fuel, so he purchased a new vehicle to lower
his  transportation  expenses.  (Tr.  47)  He  is  living  within  his  means  and  satisfying  his
financial  obligations.  He  has  approximately  $8,000  in  his  company’s  401(k)  retirement
fund.  (Tr.  54)  He  has  done  some  financial  research  to  learn  more  about  credit  and
finances.  (Tr.  55)  Applicant’s  January  2020  credit  report  lists  his  credit  score  as  686,
which is considered “good.” (Ex. C) The report lists no past-due or collection accounts.
