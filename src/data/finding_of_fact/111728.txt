Applicant,  age  32,  has  never  married  nor  has  any  children.  He  has  cohabited
with  his  girlfriend  since  2014.  Applicant’s  education  history  was  not  specified  in  the
record. This is his first application for a security clearance. He is no longer employed by
the same defense contractor who was sponsoring his  security clearance application in
July  2017.  However,  there  is  no  information  in  the  record  as  to  when  or  why  that
employment  ended  or  when  he  began  working  for  his  current  employer.  (Item  2  at  4;
Item 4 at 29-30)
In  his  July  2017  SCA,  Applicant  reported  seven  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately $19,424, including a $5,500 judgment for a defaulted loan (unalleged), a
$9,310 auto loan for vehicle that had been repossessed (unalleged), a $670 credit-card
account (unalleged), a $670 bank account (unalleged), a $1,544 medical account (SOR
¶  1.b),  a  $1,182  medical  account  (SOR  ¶  1.c),  and  a  $543  satellite  television  account
(SOR ¶ 1.d). He also reported that he failed to file his federal income tax returns or pay
his  federal  income  taxes  for  tax  years  2014  and  2016.  Only  the  failure  to  file  was
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. He explained that he had not yet filed his returns because he was
unable to locate documents that he apparently believed were necessary for him to file.
At that time, he did not know the amount of taxes, if any, that he owed. He attributed his
delinquent  debts  to  a  period  of  unemployment  that  began  in  approximately  January
2015.  He  asserted  that  he  planned  to  file  his  returns  and  pay  his  taxes  by  the  end  of
2017, and pay his delinquent debts within the next year or two years. (Item 3 at 36-44)
Applicant’s August 2017 credit report confirmed the delinquent status of the auto
loan,  the  credit-card  account,  and  the  three  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  His  November
2018 credit report confirmed the delinquent status of the $1,544 medical debt  and that
the auto loan had been paid. The reports showed that the debt underlying the judgment
was  a  $5,500  unsecured  loan  account  opened  in  2014.  Other  record  information
revealed that the judgment for the defaulted loan was entered in August 2016 for $6,203
plus interest. The reports confirm that the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.d were
sent  to  collections  in  November  2015,  April  2016,  and  December  2016,  respectively.
(Items 6; Item 4 at 11-12)
During his August 2018 SI, Applicant acknowledged that he had not yet filed his
returns or paid his taxes for tax years 2014 and 2016. He asserted that he planned  to
do  so  before  the  end  of  2018.  He  claimed  that  he  had  paid  or  satisfied  all  of  the
delinquent  accounts he  reported  on his SCA  except for the  judgment.  He averred  that
the  judgment  was  being  collected  via  a  bi-weekly  garnishment  of  25%  of  his  wages,
which  was
in
approximately  July  2018,  other  record  evidence  established  that  the  garnishment
started  in  September  2018.  He  acknowledged  that  he  had  not  received  any  financial
counseling,  but  asserted  that  his  financial  situation  was  good,  that  he  was  willing  and
able to repay all of his debts, and that he was living within his means. He stated that it
was highly unlikely that he would experience financial problems in the future. (Item 4 at
11-12; Item 5 at 2-3)
then  approximately  $480.  Although  he  recalled

In his March 2019 responses to interrogatories, Applicant acknowledged that  he
had  not  yet  paid  or  otherwise  resolved  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  through  1.d,
contrary to the claim he made during his SI. He averred that he could not afford to pay
the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c until after his garnishment ended. He believed
that  the  satellite-television  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.d  had  been  resolved  when  he
returned equipment to his creditor and promised to investigate the matter and settle the
debt  after  the  garnishment  ended.  As  of  January  2019,  the  wage  garnishments  had
reduced the balance of his judgment debt to $1,313, and he anticipated that it would be
fully paid by June 2019. He provided proof that he paid the $670 credit-card debt in April
2018. The status of his $670 bank account debt was not addressed. (Item 4 at 2-4, 9,
11-12)
In  his  March  2019  responses  to  interrogatories,  Applicant  did  not  provide  a
response to the questions about the status of his tax return filings and tax payments, but
he  did  provide  IRS  tax  records  confirming  that  he  had  not  yet  filed  his  returns  for  tax
years 2014 and 2016. Those records did not address what, if any, taxes were owed for
those years. He timely filed his 2015 and 2017 returns and received  refunds of $1,361
in February 2016 and $864 in February 2018. (Item 4 at 2, 5, 6, 15, 19, 23, 27)
In his June 24, 2019 SOR response, Applicant acknowledged that his returns for
tax years 2014 and 2016 remained unfiled. He asserted that he tried to file them on his
own, but realized that he needs professional help to do so. He claimed that the returns
would be filed “soon.” He also admitted that the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.d
had not yet been resolved because “of all the other debt that I have paid off in the past
year.” He did not provide any specific information about the referenced “other debt.” He
also stated that “I was unaware that I had a crunch in time to get all paid and settled.”
He averred that he planned to get a personal loan to pay the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶
1.b  through  1.d  and  any  taxes  that  he  owed  “by  the  end  of  June  [2019],  beginning  of
July [2019].” (Item 2)
In his December 2019 FORM response, Applicant proffered that he filed his tax
returns  and  paid  the  taxes  owed  for  tax  years  2014  and  2016,  and  paid  the  debts
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d. He provided proof of the payment for the debt alleged in
SOR  ¶  1.d,  but  not  for  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  He  promised  to  pay  the  debt
alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  “after  the  holidays.”  He  did  not  provide  proof  of  his  tax-return
filings. While  he  provided  a  document  purporting  to  prove  the  tax  payments,  it  did  not
show information sufficient to establish that fact. He stated that “if needed, I will request
the IRS forms for proof.” He also stated “I really hope I get this clearance so I keep my
job  but  if  not  it  will  be  a  life  lesson.”  He  attributed  the  further  delay  in  addressing  the
SOR  concerns  to  his  36-year-old  brother’s  passing  in  May  2019  and  his  unspecified
support of his mother who retired sometime after May 2019. (AE A, B)
Applicant  has  been  unemployed  three  times  since  January  2015:  1)  January
2015 through February 2015, which occurred after he left an employer due to a dispute
over  his  pay  rate;  2)  October  2015  through  April  2016,  which  occurred  after  he  left
another  employer  due  to  what  he  described  as  “unsatisfactory  management;”  and  3)
March 2017 through July 2017, which occurred after his contract with an employer of 11
months ended. (Item 3 at 10-17; Item 5 at 1)
Applicant’s  December  2018  and  January  2019  paychecks  revealed  two  loans
that  were  being  repaid  to  his  employer,  which  were  not  otherwise  addressed  in  the
record. The paychecks also showed that the  bi-weekly garnishment had been reduced
to  $435  in  December  and  $358  in  January.  As  of  January  2019,  Applicant  estimated
that  his  monthly  take-home  pay  was  $1,741  (after  deductions  including  the  loan
repayments  and  garnishment),  with  monthly  expenses  totaling  $1,650,  leaving  a  net
remainder of $91. Based on the two paychecks that he provided, his pay may fluctuate
with  overtime.  The  record  does  not  contain  any  information  concerning  Applicant’s
income  and  expense  history  from  the  period  immediately  preceding  January  2015
through January 2019, besides the garnishment. (Item 4 at 8, 11, 29, 30)
