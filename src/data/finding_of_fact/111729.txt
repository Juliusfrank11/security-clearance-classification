Applicant admitted to all the allegations of the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  48-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  pages  5
and 10.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since 2016. (GX 1 at page
10.) He is single, but has three children: two who are adults and a seventeen-year-old,
who lives with Applicant due to the recent death of the child’s mother. (TR at page 15
line 13 to page 18 line 21.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
Applicant’s past-due indebtedness goes back at least until 2015; but due to prior
periods of unemployment and underemployment, he has only recently began to address
his admitted past-due indebtedness. (TR at page 19 line 24 to page 30 line 4.) He now
has a positive monthly cash flow of about $625, and is well respected in his community
and in the workplace, as evidenced by six letters of support. (AppX B, and AppX C at
page 6.)
1.a.  Applicant  admits  that  he  was  indebted  to  Creditor  A,  as  the  result  of  an
automobile  repossession,  in  the  amount  of  about $15,596. This debt  has  been  settled
for  $6,300,  and  Applicant  has  made  five  of  “18”  payments,  as  evidenced  by
documentation from  Creditor A.  (TR at page  19  line  24  to page 23  line 10,  AppX  A  at
pages 1 and 2, and AppX C at pages 1~4.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.b.  Applicant  admits  that  he  was  indebted  to  State  B,  as  the  result  of  the
overpayment of unemployment benefits, in the amount of about $1,731. This debt has
been paid, as evidenced by documentation from State B. (TR at page 23 line 11 to page
26 line 17, and AppX A at page.3.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.c. Applicant admits that he is indebted to Creditor C for a past-due credit union
debt,  in  the  amount  of  about  $4,467.  Applicant  is  making  monthly  payments  of  $100
towards this debt, as evidenced by documentation from Creditor C. (TR at page 26 line
17 to page 27 line 12, at page 28 lines 4~25, AppX A at page 4, and AppX C at page 5.)
This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.d. Applicant admits that he was indebted to Creditor D for a past-due cable TV
debt,  in  the  amount  of  about  $239.  This  debt  has  been  paid,  as  evidenced  by
documentation  from  Creditor  D.  (TR  at  page  29  line  1  to  page  30  line  4,  and  Answer
Attachment D.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
