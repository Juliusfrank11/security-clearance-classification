Applicant is 42 years old. (Item 3 at page 5.) He is married, following a pervious
divorce,  with  five  children  from  both  marriages.  (Item  3  at  pages  29~31,  and  34~36.)
Applicant avers that both spouses “mishandled” the family finances. (Response at page
1.)
1.a.~1.o  Applicant  admits  15  past-due  debts  totaling  about  $97,070.  (Answer)
Through  the  auspices  of  a  debt  consolidation  service  (DCS),  on  June  10,  2020,
Applicant  began  to  address  an  unspecified  $71,560  of  these  admitted  debts.
(Response)  He  is  doing  this  by  making  bimonthly  payments  of  $464  to  the  DCS.  (Id.)
This  leaves  $25,510,  or  more  than  a  quarter  of  his  admitted  past-due  debts
unanswered.
