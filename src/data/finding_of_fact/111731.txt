Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations.  He  is  a  47-year-old  desk  side  support
technician employed by a defense contractor since March 2019. He has been employed
in similar positions since February 2001. He seeks to retain the clearance he was first
issued  in  June  1997.  He  claims  that  his  job  does  not  require  access  to  classified
information.
The SOR alleges, Government exhibits 1-6 substantiate, and Applicant admits five
delinquent  debts  totaling  over  $160,000.  The  debts  comprise  nearly  $67,000  in  three
consumer debts  owed  to  the  same  creditor, and  over  $94,000  in  delinquent  state  and
Federal income taxes. His Federal tax liability covers tax years 2011-2018; his state tax
liability covers tax years 2012, 2014-2015, and 2017-2018. He has been married for 18
years and has no children.
Applicant  reported  the  delinquent  Federal  income  taxes  on  his  June  2018
clearance  application  (GE  1).  He  discussed  the  SOR  debts  during  interviews  with  a
Government  investigator  in  September  2017  and  in  September  and  October  2018.
Applicant  acknowledged  the  delinquent  debts.  He  claimed  to  be  making  monthly
payments on his state and Federal taxes, but had not made any payment arrangements
on the consumer debts (GE 2). In his May 2019 response to DOHA interrogatories (GE
2), he stated he had a repayment plan for his state taxes but not for his Federal taxes.
His tax transcripts for tax years 2011-2018 show no Federal tax payments aside from the
seizure of his income tax refunds (GE 3). AE A reflects a series of payments to the state
tax authority between August 2016 and October 2019, but does not indicate the status of
the  account.  AE  B  reflects  that  as  of  October  2019,  Applicant  had  hired  a  financial
services company to address derogatory/frivolous items on his credit report, but that SOR
debts 1.a-1.c had yet to be addressed. AE C reflects that Applicant last made a payment
on his state taxes in November 2019, reducing his outstanding balance for tax years 2015
and 2017 to about $5,900.
Applicant  attributed  his  tax  issues  to  his  wife  not  having  adequate  income  tax
withholding  taken  from  her  earnings.  They  file  joint  taxes,  but  otherwise  manage  their
finances  separately.  However,  he  documented  no  efforts  to  address  that  issue  for  the
eight years at issue for his Federal taxes and the five years at issue for his state taxes.
He attributed his consumer debt problems to his wife not helping him with the commercial
credit obligations he undertook. His new job pays $76,000 annually; his previous salary
was $68,000 (Tr. 25).
In addition to not providing any evidence of efforts to deal with the specific SOR
debts  except  for  his  state  taxes,  Applicant  has  not  received  any  credit  or  financial
counseling. The financial services company he hired has been dealing with credit report
entries  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  He  does  not  have  a  budget.  He  provided  no  work  or
character references, or any evidence of community involvement.
