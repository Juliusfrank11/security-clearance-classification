Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e, and 1.j. She denied
the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.f through 1.i, and provided explanations. Her admissions are
incorporated into these findings.
Applicant is 34 years old. She was married from 2006 to 2013, and has a child
from that marriage of whom she has sole custody. She served on active duty in the Navy
from 2004 to 2014, when she was honorably discharged as an E-5. While serving she
held a security clearance. (GE 1)
After leaving the service, Applicant was unemployed from September 2014 until
April  2015.  She  attended  college  fulltime  during  that  period,  and  used  her  veteran’s
benefits  for  tuition  and  housing.  In  April  2015,  she  started  a  position  with  a  federal
contractor and had an annual salary of $137,000. She was terminated in November 2015
because  she  did  not  have  a  security  clearance.  She  was  then  unemployed  from
December  2015  to  August  2016,  and  returned  to  college  fulltime.  She  has  two  more
classes to complete for an associate’s degree. From September 2016 to June 2017, she
worked for a state social service agency and earned $29,000 annually. She was unable
to pay her expenses on that salary and left that position. She then moved back into her
family’s home. In October 2017, she started working for a federal contractor. She worked
for federal contractors up to September 2019 when her most recent contract ended. Her
salary for the last two years was about $50,000 annually. (Tr. 23-29, 34-40; GE 1, 2)
On October 10, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. In it,
she disclosed delinquent debts. She attributed them to a lack of employment. (GE 1) In
July 2018, a government investigator interviewed her. During the interview, she discussed
her background, employment history, and other issues, including some of the delinquent
debts listed on a credit report and subsequently alleged in the SOR. (GE 2)
Based on credit bureau reports (CBR) from March 2019 and November 2017, the
SOR alleged nine debts, which became delinquent between 2014 and 2017, and totaled
$30,382. The SOR also alleged an unpaid state tax lien for $2,570 that was filed in 2018
for tax year 2014. (GE 3, 4) The status of each debt is as follows:
1.  (1.a) The $7,758 charged-off credit card account was settled for $3,491 and
was paid in September 2019. Applicant opened the account in April 2016, while
unemployed and used it for living expenses. It was charged off in November
2017. She stated she was making monthly payments on the account when she
started the security clearance process. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 40-45; AE A
at 2; AE C).
2.  (1.b) The $7,550 debt owed to a credit union was settled for $2,138 and paid
on November 14, 2019. She opened the account in May 2014 while on active
duty.  It  was  charged  off  in  October  2017.  She  had  been  making  monthly
payments of $100 since May 2018. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 45-48; GE 2; AE
D )
3.  (1.c) The $6,190 debt owed to an apartment complex was settled for $4,344
and paid in full on June 23, 2019. She had been making payments on it. This
debt is resolved. (Tr. 49-50; AE 2 at 3, AE E)
4.  (1.d) The $4,078 charged-off account owed to a bank was settled for $1,506,
and is paid. She opened the account in March 2014 and it became delinquent
in May 2014. She started making payments on this personal loan in February
2019. This debt is resolved. (Tr.50-52; GE 1; AE I)
5.  (1.e) The $2,626  charged-off  account  owed to  a  credit  union  was settled for
$525. She opened the account in May 2016, while unemployed. She started
making payments in January 2019 and paid it off on November 14, 2019. This
debt is resolved. (Tr. 52-53; GE 3; AE F)
6.  (1.f) Applicant testified that the $418 charged-off debt owed to a retail store was
not her debt, although she had an old account with the creditor. She contacted
the creditor, who told her that it did not have information linking any charges to
her  account,  meaning  she  did  not  have  a  delinquent  debt.  She  wrote  the
creditor  a  letter  about  a  possible  fraudulent  charge.  In  November  2019,  the
retailor sent  Applicant a  response  stating  that  it  was  no  longer attempting to
collect  the  debt.  It  no  longer  appears  on  her  November  2019  credit  report,
although  it  was  on  the  Government’s  March  2019  credit  report.  This  debt  is
resolved. (Tr. 54-56; GE 3; AE A)
7.  (1.g) Applicant denied owing the $385 charged-off credit card debt. According
to the November 2017 CBR, this account was opened in December 2012 and
charged-off in September 2013. Applicant stated in her Answer that on August
1, 2019, she called and spoke to a specific agent with the creditor, who told her
that there was no open or closed account in her name. It does not appear on
her March or November 2019 CBRs. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 58-59; GE 3, 4;
AE A) (Inadvertently, this debt was not discussed during this hearing.)
8.  (1.h) Applicant denied owing the $924 collections account debt owed to a cable
company. She said she previously had service with the company and paid the
contract in full. She tried to contact the collection agency for the  creditor, but
could not find a working number. The account was reported as delinquent in
November 2017 and listed as open on the Government’s November 2017 CBR.
The debt does not appear on the Government’s March 2019 CBR or Applicant’s
November 2019 CBR. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 58-60; GE 4 at 19, GE 3; AE
A)
9.  (1.i)  The  $456  collections  account  for  utilities  is  resolved.  It  is  listed  on
Applicant’s November 2019 CBR as having  been paid in January  2018, and
there is also on a letter from a collection agency noting it was paid in November
2019. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 60-61; AE A at 3, AE H)
10.  (1.j)  In  June  2018,  a  state  filed  a  tax  lien  against  Applicant  for  a  $2,570
judgment  debt  for  tax  year  2014.  Applicant  learned  of  this  debt  when  she
received the June 2019 SOR. She thinks notices regarding this lien were sent
to her old address so she did not know about it. She contacted the state, and
was told that this lien was filed because she had not filed her state income tax
return that year. She has not entered into a repayment plan yet because she
has not had enough money to make payments. She intends to pay it; however,
there is no evidence that she has filed the 2014 return. This debt is unresolved.
(Tr. 62-65; GE 5)
Applicant  has  not  been  employed  since  October  2019.  She  knew  her  job  was
terminating  and  planned  for  the  loss  of  income.  She  prepaid  her  November  and
December 2019 rent, along with other expenses.  Currently, she receives $430 in child
support and  $460  in  disability  from the  veteran’s administration  (VA) each month. She
also collects $357 weekly in unemployment. She is returning to college in January 2020,
and  will  use  her  veteran’s  benefits.  She  will  take  the  minimum  number  of  classes  to
remain in fulltime status. (Tr. 65-72) Applicant has not taken financial or credit counseling
recently;  however,  she  took  budget  courses  while  serving  in  the  military.  (Tr.  30-31)  I
offered Applicant the opportunity to submit a written budget, but she did not do so. (Tr.
75-76)
In addition to filing a $2,570 tax lien against Applicant in June 2018 for her unpaid
2014 taxes, the state also filed a $1,515 tax lien against her in April 2019. (GE 6) Applicant
admitted that she owed both liens. In discussing them, Applicant stated that she has not
filed  her  2018  federal  or  state  income  tax  returns  and  may  owe  taxes  for  that  year,
although she appeared unclear as to that issue. She said she filed her 2017 tax returns.
(Tr. 32-33, 64-65, 73-74.)
The  SOR  did  not  allege  a  security  concern  related  to  the  2019  tax  lien  or
Applicant’s unfiled 2018 federal or state income tax returns or unpaid taxes for that year.
This information is not considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered in
making  a  credibility  determination,  in  the  application  of  mitigating  conditions,  and  in  a
comprehensive whole-person analysis.
