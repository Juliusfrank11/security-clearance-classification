Applicant was born in Somalia in 1963. He immigrated to the United States in 1984,
and became a U.S. citizen in 1992. He has a co-habitant, and one adult child from a prior
marriage. Applicant has a high school diploma and some college. He is seeking to obtain
national security eligibility in connection with a prospective job as a linguist with the DoD.
Applicant  is  conversant  in  several  languages,  but  English  is  not  his  first  language,  as
shown in the transcript. Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. (Government
Exhibit 1 at Sections 9, 12, 13.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he uses intoxicants to excess. Applicant had a severe alcohol problem for many
years.  He  began  drinking  in  1982.  He  began  drinking  heavily  in  1995.  (Government
Exhibit 3 at 11-12; Tr. at 69.)
Applicant’s alcohol problem resulted in several alcohol-related arrests, as set forth
below:
1.a. Applicant was first arrested for DUI in April 1997. The available records do
not show a disposition. Applicant does not have an accurate recollection of the disposition
of this case. (Government Exhibit 3 at 9-10, Exhibit 5 at 5; Tr. at 24-25.)
1.b.  Applicant  was  arrested  for  DUI  a  second  time  in  September  1998.  The
available  records  do  not  show  a  disposition.  Applicant  does  not  have  an  accurate
recollection of the disposition of this case. (Government Exhibit 3 at 10, Exhibit 5 at 5; Tr.
at 25.)
1.c.  Applicant  was  arrested  a  third  time  for  DUI  in  November  2004.  He  was
convicted and sentenced to one day in jail, probation for three years, and a fine. Applicant
testified that he completed all the requirements of his sentence. (Government Exhibit 5 at
2; Tr. at 26-27.)
1.d. Applicant was again arrested for DUI in December 2006. The available records
do  not  show  a  disposition.  Applicant  believes  that  this  case  was  either  vacated  or
dismissed.  He  further  stated  that  he  had  not  been  drinking  on  the  date  in  question.
(Government Exhibit 3 at 8, Exhibit 5 at 5; Tr. at 28.)
1.e. Applicant was arrested for Extreme DUI  and Failure to Stop at an Accident
Scene in January 2007. Applicant did not resolve this arrest in a timely fashion and an
arrest  warrant  was  issued.  He  resolved  this  case  in  2013,  along  with  the  offense  in
allegation 1.h. The sentence included jail for 90 days, probation for three years, a fine,
community service and restitution. (Government Exhibit 3 at 9, Exhibit 5 at 5-6; Tr. at 28-
30, 37.)
Applicant’s driver’s license was also suspended for two years as a result of this
case  and  1.h.  At  the  end  of  that  time,  approximately  2015,  Applicant  had  to  have  an
ignition interlock device installed in his car. The device was originally supposed to be in
his car for three years. However, due to two incidents involving Applicant and his vehicle,
the time was extended by an additional two years. The device was still on his car at the
time of the hearing. Applicant has a current driver’s license, which was reviewed by this
administrative judge, confirming that Applicant was restricted to driving vehicles with an
interlock device. (Tr. at 46-52, 71-73.)
1.f. Applicant was again arrested for DUI in March 2008. The available records do
not show a disposition. Applicant does not have an accurate recollection of the disposition
of this case. (Government Exhibit 5 at 3; Tr. at 30.)
1.g. Applicant was arrested for Disorderly Conduct While Intoxicated in April 2008.
The records show he was convicted and paid a fine. (Government Exhibit 3 at 10, Exhibit
5 at 3; Tr. at 30-31.)
1.h. Applicant was arrested for extreme DUI in February 2010. He failed to appear
and a warrant was issued. Applicant testified that he found out about the warrants in this
case and allegation 1.e in 2013, at that time he went to court and resolved both cases.
The  sentence  included  jail  for  90  days,  probation  for  three  years,  a  fine,  community
service and restitution. (Government Exhibit 3 at 10-11, Exhibit 5 at 6; Tr. at 31-37.)
According to Applicant, the 2010 arrest for extreme DUI occurred because he was
having an epileptic seizure after drinking. He testified that police took him to the hospital,
where  he  was  diagnosed  with  diabetes.  At  that  time  Applicant  did  not  know  he  was
suffering from diabetes. Because of his diabetes diagnosis, Applicant made the decision
to stop drinking alcohol for health reasons. As of the date of the hearing he had not had
anything  to  drink  in  approximately  nine  years.  He  submitted  a  laboratory  report  dated
October 18, 2019. That report stated Applicant had no alcohol in his system, and that he
had diabetic levels of blood sugar. (Government Exhibit 3 at 10-11; Applicant Exhibit C;
Tr. at 32-33, 37-39.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline F: Financial Considerations)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  failed  to  meet  his  financial  obligations  and  is  therefore  potentially
unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
Applicant admitted that he did not filed his 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 Federal
and state income tax returns in a timely fashion. He submitted documentation showing
that  the  subject  tax  returns  were  all  filed  in  2018.  (Government  Exhibit  2;  Applicant
Exhibits A and B.)
For  many  years  Applicant  has  owned  a  small  business  in  the  United  States.
According  to  Applicant  he  was  unable  to  complete  his  tax  returns  in  a  timely  manner
because of the actions of his business partner, who did not provide timely information to
Applicant. In addition, Applicant was making a minimal income in the United States during
those years and he wrongfully believed he did not need to file a tax return. Applicant is in
the midst of closing down the partnership so as to avoid any future problems. (Tr. 39-42,
44, 52-65.)
In addition to operating his state-side business, Applicant was living and working
outside the United States during 2014, 2015, and 2017. That fact made it difficult for him
to communicate with his business partner and his tax preparer. In 2018 Applicant decided
it  was  time  to  file  all  of  his  missing  tax  returns.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at  Section  11,
Exhibit 4.)
Available records show that Applicant’s 2017 tax returns were filed, albeit late. In
addition,  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  had  yet  to  file  his  2018  income  tax
returns. He was uncertain of the status of those tax returns, and was unable to provide a
time frame in which they would be filed. (Tr. 43-44.)
Paragraph 3 (Guideline E: Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant has engaged in conduct
that  shows  questionable  judgment,  untrustworthiness,  unreliability,  dishonesty,  and  an
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.
Allegation 3.a states that Applicant’s conduct under paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR
are cognizable under this paragraph as well.
Allegation 3.b concerns an arrest of Applicant in December 2010 for Driving with
a  Forged  or  Counterfeit  Driver’s  License,  Driving  While  License  Suspended,  and  No
Vehicle Registration. He was convicted and sentenced to three days in jail and probation
for  three  years.  Applicant  was  stopped  by  police  and  presented  his  brother’s  driver’s
license, since Applicant’s driving privileges had been suspended. Applicant admitted that
he  had  been  driving  on  an  occasional  basis  during  the  time  his  license  had  been
suspended. He stopped this conduct in approximately 2013. (Government Exhibit 3 at 12,
Exhibit 5 at 3-4; Tr. 45-46, 65-69.)
