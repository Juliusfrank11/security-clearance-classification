After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  high  school  graduate  with  about  three  semesters  of
college. He is currently in divorce proceedings with his second wife. He has been working
as a senior program manager servicing the Air Force under a contract between a staffing
company and a defense contractor since August 2019. (Tr. 94.) His continued employment
is contingent on a favorable adjudication of his clearance eligibility. (GE 1; AEs I, N-O.)
Applicant  has  a  service-connected  20%  disability  rating  with  the  Department  of
Veteran’s Affairs (VA). (Tr. 87.) He served on active duty in the United States military with a
secret clearance under the occupational specialty of military police from January 2002 to
January 2007. From March 2003 through December 2003, he was deployed to Iraq and
then Afghanistan. While serving at the rank of specialist (E-4) in South Korea, Applicant
was  accused  in  January  2006  with  fraud,  forgery,  and  making  a  false  statement  by
producing  various  military  school  certificates  allegedly  fraudulently  obtained  regarding
combat action badges, airborne school, air assault school, Special Forces training, and
lateral  appointment  to  corporal.  He  was  also  accused  of  impersonating  a  non-
commissioned  officer  and  with  unauthorized  wearing  of  a  military  uniform  for  wearing
sergeant (E-5) rank when he was an E-4. Applicant admitted to military investigators that
he had worn sergeant rank, but he denied altering documents for his enlisted records. He
explained that he had taken an assignment as a warfighter team leader and was informed
in August 2006 that he had made points to be promoted to sergeant.  The investigation
revealed that Applicant obtained a new identification card showing sergeant rank, but he
did not have orders showing his promotion. (GE 6.) Applicant did not request a trial by
court-martial. He was found to have committed offenses with respect to all five allegations
in a non-judicial punishment proceeding on September 18, 2006. His record was flagged
with a bar to reenlistment, and he was reduced in rank to private (E-1), ordered to forfeit
pay  of  $636  per  month  for  two  months,  given  45  days  of  extra  duty,  and  placed  on
restriction  for  45  days.  (GEs  7-8.)  His  case  was  referred  to  the  military  criminal
investigation command, who found probable cause to believe that Applicant committed the
offenses, including that he had presented altered or false documents to the Personnel
Services Battalion. (GE 6.)
Applicant appealed the punishment, in part asking that he be allowed to separate
from  the  military  at  the  rank  of  E-3,  the  minimum  rank  required  for  him  to  report  to  a
Special Forces command in the National Guard in January 2007. Applicant also requested
a reduction to $300 a month ($600 total) in forfeited pay because he had financial issues
caused by a divorce, and he had just enrolled at a state university. He asked that he be
given only 14 days of restriction and 14 days of extra duty because he needed surgery and
would not have enough time to complete the 45 days after convalescent leave before his
ETS  date  of  November  22,  2006.  Applicant  asserted  on  appeal  of  his  non-judicial
punishment that he “never did anything with wrongful intention.” Applicant presented some
character  references  from  soldiers  attesting  to  his  leadership.  Those  soldiers,  who
acknowledged that Applicant made “a mistake,” regarded his punishment as too harsh. (AE
G.) Applicant was apparently unsuccessful in his appeal as his DD-214 shows that he was
separated  from  active  duty  at  the  rank  of  E-1  in  January  2007.  He  was  granted  an
honorable discharge under the separation code of “LBK” (involuntary discharge). (AE G.)
Applicant now denies that he committed any fraudulent activity, to include forgery
and  making  a  false  statement,  and  he  attributes  those  charges  to  an  “obsessive”  first
sergeant, even though the Commander’s Report of Disciplinary or Administrative Action
indicates that he pled “guilty” to all five of the alleged offenses. (GE 7.) It is noted that to
receive a reduction from specialist (E-4) to private (E-1) and the other serious punishments
imposed under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the imposing commander
must be a field grade commander, not a noncommissioned officer. Applicant explained that
the non-judicial punishment was for him driving a rented vehicle in Korea, in violation of the
Status of Forces Agreement for anyone under the E-5 rank to drive a private vehicle in
Korea.  He  presented  a  record  of  Article  15  proceedings  dated  September  18,  2006,
regarding his wrongful driving without authorization between July 1, 2006, and July 31,
2006, misconduct substantiated by a staff sergeant (SSG), who swore that he witnessed
Applicant get behind the wheel of a privately-owned vehicle in late July 2006, which was
against the Status of Forces Agreement for enlisted personnel of Applicant’s rank or lower
to operate a private vehicle in Korea. The SSG attested that Applicant had told him that a
colonel had authorized the vehicle under an exception because he needed the vehicle for
training purposes. (AE G.) Records submitted by the Government (GEs 6-8) show that the
punishment,  include  the  reduction  in  rank  to  E-1,  was  imposed  for  the  misconduct  in
January 2006.
When Applicant responded to the SOR, he admitted that he wore sergeant rank
when he should not have, but asserts he had passed his E-5 Board and was on the list to
be promoted at any time. He claimed without any corroborating documentation that his
Leave and Earning Statement (LES) reflected his rank as sergeant, but acknowledged that
he did not have formal orders of that rank. He attributed his “mistake” to being a “young
Solider  that  was  too  excited.”  Applicant  maintained  that  if  he  had  known  that  the
administrative action would impact his civilian career, he would have chosen a court-martial
proceeding,  where  he  could  have  contested  the  allegations  with  evidence  and  legal
representation. He explained that he accepted the non-judicial proceedings because those
whom he trusted most told him it was not worth going through a court-martial. (Answer; Tr.
77-78.)
In his appeal of the non-judicial punishment, Applicant indicated that he had just
signed up as a student at a university. (AE G.) Applicant instead attended a different state
college for a semester and a half after he was discharged from the military. (Tr. 105.) He
withdrew from the school in May 2008. (AE H.) The credit reports in evidence (GEs 3-4, 10)
and a record from a loan servicer (AE H) show two student loans obtained in December
2006: a private student loan for $16,721 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and a federal Stafford student loan
for $3,500 (not alleged), both in default. (AE H.) He contests the validity of the private
student loan (SOR ¶ 1.a), asserting that he had only the one $3,500 student loan. (Tr.
105.)  He  presented  information  about  the  $3,500  loan  indicating  that  it  was  placed  in
forbearance in October 2009, January 2014, and June 2015. He defaulted on a $1,161
balance in December 2016, even though his repayment term was under $50 a month. (Tr.
106.) He paid $1,280 to resolve the debt on March 6, 2017, after his loan had been placed
for collection and his default reported to the credit reporting agencies. (GEs 3-4 10; AE H.)
Applicant reportedly was self-employed as a yacht captain from January 2007 to
December 2007 while attending college. His contract was not renewed, and he listed on an
August  2017  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  that  he  was
unemployed from January 2008 to August 2008. (GE 1.) His resume discrepantly indicates
that  he  worked  as  a  contract  communications  engineer  for  a  company  that  provided
communications expertise to the U.S. military and private aircraft companies from August
2007 to February 2009. (AE I.)
Applicant reports that he then worked as an information technology project manager
for an airline until September 2011. (AE I.) He was self-employed from September 2011 to
November 2013, when he relocated for a vice president position with a “partner company.”
(GE 1; AE I.)
In June 2015, Applicant began renting an apartment at $2,380 per month (SOR ¶
1.c), under a 12-month lease. (AE C.) His then employer had financial issues and reduced
his pay significantly. Applicant could no longer afford his rent, and he advised the property
management office that he needed to terminate the lease  early. When he vacated the
apartment at the end of February 2016, he thought he had a verbal agreement from the
management company and did not have to pay the remainder of the lease, even though
his lease terms required him to give 60-day notice of termination and provided for a penalty
of two months’ rent for early termination. (Answer.) In May 2016, he was billed $8,111 by
the property management company, which included a penalty of one month’s rent. (AE C.)
In August 2016, his account was placed for collection. (GE 3.)
Applicant reported no outstanding financial delinquencies on his August 2017 SF 86
for eligibility for a secret clearance to work as a consultant for an information technology
company. (GE 1.) He asserted in response to the SOR that he did not learn about the
apartment debt (SOR ¶ 1.c) before approximately September 2017, when he applied for a
home  loan.  (Answer.)  However,  May  2016  the  billing  statement,  which  he  provided  in
evidence, suggests that he knew about the debt well before September 2017.
Applicant and his wife married in October 2017, after cohabiting since March 2016.
(GE 1.) While applying for a mortgage to purchase a home, Applicant and his wife learned
that a creditor was reporting that he had defaulted on a student loan obtained in December
2006, then with the creditor identified in SOR ¶ 1.e. On September 9, 2017, Applicant and
his wife informed a mortgage consultant, in writing, that his “original and only student loan
was paid in full the beginning of this year.” They explained that the loan (i.e., his federal
student loan for $3,500) went into collections “for a couple of months many years ago and
was sold to multiple creditors.” They asserted that the listing of a $19,566 collection debt
(SOR ¶ 1.e) on his credit record was fraudulent. (GE 5; AE H.) Applicant denies that he
made a false statement to the mortgage consultant, explaining that his lone student loan
was only in default for one month before he paid it off. (Tr. 79.)
Within a few weeks of their wedding, Applicant and his wife closed on a home near
her family in October 2017. They purchased the property in part with a VA-backed loan of
$379,000,  requiring  repayment  at  $2,797  per  month.  Applicant’s  income  was  about
$50,000 annually while his wife earned “over $130,000” annually. (Tr. 56, 104.) During their
marriage, she worked as a physician in her father’s medical practice. (Tr. 56, 60.) Applicant
and  his  wife  were  paying  on  a  truck  loan  obtained  in  January  2016  for  $71,869.  The
account  was  past  due  in  September  2016,  and  again  from  December  2016  through
February  2017.  (GE  3;  Tr.  120-121.)  That  loan  was  paid  off  in  December  2017  when
Applicant bought a 2018 Ford 150 truck for himself with a loan of $83,072, to be repaid at
$1,415  a  month.  (AE  A.)  The  loan  balance  was  so  high  because  he  rolled  the  debt
remaining on his spouse’s and her sister’s vehicles into his new loan. (Tr. 62, 103.)
A  check  of  Applicant’s  credit  on  November  14,  2017,  listed  several  collection
balances:  $19,566  defaulted  student  loan  balance  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.e,  same  debt);
$19,585 for breaking his apartment lease in 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.c); $777 from June 2016 in
dispute  with  a  telecommunications  company  (SOR  ¶  1.d);  $456  for  cable  television
services (SOR 1.f); and $328 owed to an insurance company since April 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.g).
Applicant or his spouse was making timely payments on three credit-card accounts with
balances totaling $4,019. (GE 3.)
In mid-March 2018, Applicant started a new job as a contract program manager
supporting the U.S. Army. He indicated in response to the SOR that he was “so close to
being financially stable” in the spring of 2018. Yet, available credit information indicates
that  Applicant  and  his  wife  began  falling  behind  on  their  mortgage  in  April  2018.  The
account information for his new truck loan (SOR ¶ 1.a) shows that his payments have been
chronically late since February 2018, and he has been regularly assessed late fees. (AE
A.)
Applicant  and  his  wife  legally  separated  in  early  July  2018.  (Tr.  56,  94.)  In
Applicant’s  July  9,  2018  petition  for  divorce,  he  asked  the  court  to  equitably  divide,
distribute, or assign the marital property between him and his wife without regard to her
marital misconduct. (AE N.)
On August 6, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He indicated that he would not be responsible for
any of the marital debt. When confronted about the adverse credit entries on his credit
record, Applicant admitted that he had a student loan that had been in default for $1,161,
but that he then paid it. Applicant denied any knowledge of the $328 insurance debt (SOR
¶ 1.g) and stated that his account was current. Applicant asserted that the cable services
debt for $456 (SOR ¶ 1.f) was his wife’s responsibility. When asked about the student loan
with a listed high credit of $16,721 (SOR ¶ 1.b),  Applicant did not dispute that he had
obtained a student loan in December 2006, or that he had fallen behind because he had
not realized that the payments were being drawn from his account past their due dates.
Apparently  thinking  of  his  federal  student  loan,  he  asserted  that  when  the  matter was
brought to his attention, he brought the account current and stated that he could provide
documentation of its satisfaction. Applicant recognized the $777 telecommunications debt
(SOR ¶ 1.d), but stated that he was in the process of disputing the charge because the
account was in his wife’s name. Applicant stated that he was also disputing the charges
owed a former landlord (SOR ¶ 1.c). (GE 2.)
The divorce proceedings put a “huge strain” on Applicant’s finances. He testified that
he had to pay his divorce attorney around $22,700, but has paid all but $1,000 of her fees.
(Tr. 121.) On October 1, 2018, his divorce attorney billed him for $10,000 to replenish his
trust account for legal matters. (AE P.)
In December 2018, Applicant moved near his family into a family-owned house, and
he listed the marital property for sale. He did not make the mortgage payments, and his
and his spouse’s mortgage lender eventually initiated foreclosure of their mortgage loan. In
May 2019, Applicant refinanced his truck loan to remove his ex-wife’s name from any legal
responsibility for paying for his truck, as required by the terms of his pending divorce. His
truck payment on his new loan was 13 days late for June 2019, 14 days late for July 2019,
14  days  late  for  August  2019,  19  days  late  for September 2019,  and  10  days  late  for
October 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.a) (AE A), although his account was reported as current to the
credit bureaus. (GE 10.)
In August 2019, Applicant began his current job at an hourly rate of $52.13 per hour.
(AEs  I,  Q;  Tr. 55.) He used his remaining savings to cover the costs of his relocation.
(Answer.)
As of October 2019, Applicant’s credit report showed that the mortgage on his and
his wife’s marital residence was in foreclosure proceedings with a $408,876 balance. A
private student loan for $16,721 had been charged off as a bad debt after no payments
since June 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.b), but it was also reported that his dispute about the debt had
been resolved. (GE 10.) On November 8, 2019, Applicant and his wife sold their marital
residence for $350,000 plus fees for a total of $380,838 from the buyer at settlement.
Some $327,673 went to pay off their loan on the house. (AE K.)
On October 10, 2019, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant, in part because of
the  delinquent  accounts  on  his  credit  reports.  Available  credit  information  showed  the
following with respect to the SOR accounts:
Vehicle loan past due for $2,381 on an $80,111 balance (SOR ¶ 1.a)
Payment records for the truck loan indicate that since December 2017, Applicant
had been assessed $1,427.32 in late charges. His payments have been consistently late.
After making a late payment for October 2019, his loan had a principal balance of $68,863.
(AE A.) Applicant’s explanation for being chronically late is that he has had to pay his
divorce attorney, and she recommended that he pay debts only when she advised him to
pay. (Tr. 101.) Applicant asserted that he is now caught up in his payments, because in
December 2018, he had his lender add one month to the end of his loan. (Tr. 101-103.)
Student loan for $21,524 in collection (SOR ¶ 1.b, same debt as SOR ¶ 1.e)
The credit bureaus have consistently reported that Applicant obtained a joint private
loan in December 2006. (GEs 3-4, 10.) Applicant told the military in late fall 2006 that he
had just signed up as a full-time student at a university. He may have obtained a private
student loan for that institution, which he ultimately did not attend, although there is no
evidence  in  this  regard.    As  of  July  2017,  the  loan  was  reportedly  charged  off  and  in
collection  for  $16,721.  (GEs  3-4.)  In  August  2019,  the  creditor in  SOR  ¶  1.b  placed  a
$22,608 debt for collection. (GE 10; AE B.) The creditor in SOR ¶ 1.b is a student-loan
trust  entity  with  a  history  of  using  service  providers to  file  lawsuits  to  collect  defaulted
student loans barred from collection under the applicable statue of limitations or without
documentation to prove that the person owed the debt. (GE 9.) On October 1, 2019, a
collection  entity  informed  Applicant  that  the  creditor  was  willing  to  accept  $9,129  in
settlement of a $22,823 balance. On November 4, 2019, Applicant requested validation of
the debt (AE B), which was still on his credit record as an outstanding collection debt. (GE
10.) Applicant had received no response to his correspondence as of March 2020. He
asserts that the debt is fraudulent, but he provided no documentation showing the debt has
been removed from his credit record. (Tr. 63, 108.) Applicant has retained a lawyer to
assist him with regard to whether to file a lawsuit against the student-loan trust entity, but it
has  yet  to  be  shown  if  legal  action  against  the  trust  entity  by  the  Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau (CFPB) applies to him. (Tr. 108.)
Apartment rent collection debt for $19,585 (SOR ¶ 1.c)
Applicant prematurely terminated his lease for an apartment in February 2016 when
he could no longer afford the rent. (Answer.) At his hearing, he testified that for five or six
months in 2016, he was not paid because his then employer lost contracts, and he had no
income apart from his VA disability. (Tr. 64-65, 91-93.) On May 4, 2016, he was billed
$8,111 by his former landlord for back rent and utilities. In August 15, 2016, his account
was placed for collection. On September 27, 2019, a collection entity informed Applicant
that his creditor would be willing to settle his debt balance of $19,584 for $9,792. (AE C.)
On  November  1,  2019,  Applicant  contacted  the  collection  entity  for  another  offer.  He
asserts that he was told the creditor wanted the full balance. Applicant verbally asked for a
verification  of  the  debt.  (Answer.)  On  December  15,  2019,  Applicant  sent  a  letter
requesting validation of the debt. (AE L.) Applicant testified that he is solely responsible for
any balance owed because his wife (then fiancée) was not on the lease (Tr. 65), but also
that he is willing to split a bill of $6,000 with his estranged wife on their divorce settlement.
(Tr. 95-98.) Applicant’s October 2019 credit report states “Account information disputed by
consumer, meets FCRA requirements.” (GE 10.) In response to the Government’s position
that the debt appears to be a legitimate debt that meets the Fair Collection Requirements
Act, Applicant testified that he mistakenly disputed the debt under an incorrect criteria and
should have disputed the amount owed. (Tr. 100.) As of March 2020, Applicant had made
no payments on the debt. Should he receive no response from the creditor to his request
for verification, he plans to “take the legal actions appointed to [him] as a consumer.” (Tr.
118.)
Telecommunications company debt for $777 in collection (SOR ¶ 1.d)
A  $777  debt  with  a  telecommunications  company  from  January  2016  was  in
collection as of December 2018. (GE 4.) As of October 2019, the debt was on his credit
record as an unpaid collection balance. (GE 10.) Applicant submits that the credit entry
should have been removed from his credit record some time ago because the debt was for
old rented equipment that he returned late. He presented in evidence an October 2019
billing statement showing that he was an existing customer of the creditor and had just
reduced his monthly charges from $235 to $124 by bundling services. (AE D.) While that
account was current, the account bears a different number than that reported for the debt
in collection. (GE 10.) On November 4, 2019, Applicant sent a letter to the collection entity
requesting validation of the debt. (AE D.)
Cable services debt for $456 in collection (SOR ¶ 1.f)
As  of  October  2017,  a  cable  debt  of  $456  was  in  collection.  (GE  3.)  Applicant
explained that his wife did not turn in equipment from their marital residence on time. (Tr.
67.) As of November 2019, Applicant was being pursued for a collection balance of $710
by another cable services company, which Applicant asserts was for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f.
(AE E.) He provided no documentation for his claim that the two companies had “some sort
of entity agreement.” On November 4, 2019, Applicant sent a letter to the collection entity
requesting validation of the debt. On December 17, 2019, he received a response from the
collection entity pursuing him for the $710 indicating that his account had been closed and
returned to the creditor. (AE E.) There is no evidence that the $456 debt has been paid or
that it is fraudulent, although it had been removed from his credit record as of December
2018. (GE 4.) Applicant claims that the debt was removed from his credit because his wife
added his name to the account after the fact. (GE 4; Tr. 71-73.) Applicant testified that the
debt is in dispute. (Tr. 77.)
Insurance debt for $328 in collection (SOR ¶ 1.g)
Applicant incurred the debt due to financial hardship caused by his divorce, but he
paid the debt in full. (Tr. 74.) The alleged debt does not appear on Applicant’s credit report
as of October 2019. (GE 10.) Records of Applicant’s account with the insurance provider
show that, after a $205 payment in late December 2018, he renewed his policy at a cost of
$1,028 for six months.  He set up $169 automatic payments that were declined. His policy
was  cancelled  in  late  March  2019  for  nonpayment  with  $567  owed.  After  a  payment
cleared  in  late  March  2019,  his  coverage  was  reinstated.  In  July  2019,  his policy  was
renewed. After a payment of $252 in late September 2019, he was billed $463 in October
2019. (AE F.)
As of October 2019, Trans Union was reporting additional debts not listed in the
SOR, including a collection debt of $912 from September 2018 that was charged off in May
2019 by an online home furnishings retailer. (GE 10.) As of November 2019, Applicant was
disputing  the  debt  on  the  basis  that  his  wife  opened  it  for  furniture  for  their  marital
household, although he indicated that he would pay it if verified. (Answer.) A letter from the
collection entity indicates that Applicant was the account holder and that he paid $273 on
March 4, 2020. (AE S.) Trans Union was also reporting that a $6,194 debt, on an account
opened in December 2014, had been charged off in June 2015 after no payments since
January 2015. (GE 10.) Applicant testified that it was a marital debt for furniture for their
home. (Tr. 111.) The evidence shows that the debt was incurred two years before he and
his wife bought their home, and prior to their reported cohabitation. Applicant wants his
spouse to agree in the divorce to hold him harmless for debts she incurred in his name.
Applicant testified that his divorce attorney advised him to not pay any of the revolving
credit-card accounts on his credit report before his divorce settlement is finalized. (Tr. 57.)
Applicant terminated the services of his divorce attorney in February 2020 because of the
expense. He has elected to proceed pro se in his divorce proceedings going forward. (Tr.
58.)
On March 13, 2020, Applicant provided a copy of the proposed divorce settlement,
which has yet to be executed. Under the pending divorce settlement, charges in Applicant’s
name are solely his responsibility. As for joint credit-card debts, Applicant wants his spouse
to agree to hold him harmless for six accounts, none of which are listed in the SOR. Utility
bills incurred while the marital house was vacant from December 2018 to November 2019
are to be divided equally. (AE O.)
Applicant rents an apartment in the city for $2,600 per month. He has nothing in
savings, but he has checking account deposits of approximately $10,000. (Tr. 115.)
10
On January 23, 2020, Applicant’s military customer requested an interim access
waiver for six months to allow Applicant access to a NIPRnet network on the military base.
The request was approved on January 27, 2020. (AE J.) As of March 4, 2020, Applicant
was the project lead on a program involving an acquisition strategy on cyber technologies
for the military. (AE M; Tr. 86.)
