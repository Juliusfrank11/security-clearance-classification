Having  thoroughly  considered  the  evidence  in  the  record,  including  Applicant's
admissions, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 58 years old. He graduated
from college with a bachelor’s degree in 1985. In 1989, he married, but he was separated
from his spouse in 2010, and in 2012, their divorce was finalized. They have four adult
children. (Tr. 16, 19, 55; GE 1)
In 1992, Applicant started his own computer software consulting company. He was
very  successful  for  many  years  with  his  business.  In  mid-2000,  Applicant  was  not
receiving much income or profit from his business. In 2002, a doctor solicited Applicant
to start up a medical software business. Applicant and the doctor became owners of the
limited liability company, and the doctor provided his income and revenue while Applicant
developed the software. Over time, Applicant invested more of his money and time into
the  medical  software,  to  the  detriment  of  his  other  consulting  software  business.  He
acknowledged at the hearing that developing new software was a risk, but he believed
the medical software had great potential in the medical community. His income continued
to steadily decrease over time. In 2010, his wife left him, and his income was reduced
even  more.  In  2012,  he  borrowed  money  from  his  retirement  fund,  which  caused
additional adverse tax consequences for him. Applicant was unemployed with no income
from approximately 2014 through the fall of 2016,  and due to these circumstances,  he
experienced severe financial and tax complications. (Tr. 17-19, 58-59, 96)
Prior to development of the medical software in 2002, Applicant had an impeccable
credit history and had timely filed all of his annual tax returns. In 2014, the doctor found
another business partner, and Applicant was no longer receiving any income. Applicant
did  not  have  money  for  food,  and  with  the  failed  business  and  his  difficult  divorce,  he
started  to  use  alcohol  to  excess.  In  June  2014,  Applicant  was  hospitalized  after  he
stopped eating food and was only drinking alcohol. In October 2014, he realized that he
needed to turn his life around. He met with an attorney and filed his 2010-2014 tax returns
in  late  2014.  He  dissolved  the  medical  software  company  in  2015,  battled  in  court  to
maintain  his  rights  to  the  medical  software,  and  he  filed  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in
September  2015.  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  His  allowable  bankruptcy  liabilities  were  discharged  in
January 2016.  (Tr. 19, 59- 64, 71, 88-89; GE 1, GE 2)
In April 2017, Applicant obtained employment with a DOD contractor as a software
engineer. His employer is sponsoring him for a security clearance that is necessary for
him  to  perform  specific  job  duties.  Since  his  employment,  Applicant  has  received
outstanding employee evaluations and regular increases in pay. His current annual salary
is $132,016. (Tr. 23, 57; GE 1; AE A, AE B, AE G, AE H, AE M)
SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.e allege that Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government in the
approximate amount of $90,475, for the unpaid taxes for tax years 2011-2014. Applicant
overpaid his Federal taxes for tax years 2016, 2017 and 2018. His combined Federal tax
refunds in the approximate amount of $16,243 were applied to his delinquent Federal tax
debt. Applicant made an offer in compromise to the Internal Revenue Service, (IRS) in
April  2019.  Beginning  in  May  2019,  he  started  making  monthly  payments  of  $696  in
accordance  with  his  Offer  in  Compromise.  After  making  seven  consecutive  monthly
payments  totaling  $4,872,  he  received  notification  from  the  IRS  that  his  Offer  in
Compromise  was  not  accepted.  The  IRS  believed  he  was  capable  of  paying  his
delinquent  Federal  taxes  in  full.  Applicant  received  communication  from  an  IRS
representative informing him  that if an installment agreement was established with the
IRS, his monthly payments would be $1,533. In December 2019, Applicant began making
these monthly payments. As of January 2020, Applicant estimated he had repaid about
$28,181 of his delinquent Federal tax debt. He intends to continue paying his Federal tax
debt until it is fully resolved. (Tr. 23-25, 89-94; AE C, AE D, AE F, AE L, AE O)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges that Applicant is indebted to State A for delinquent taxes in the
approximate amount of $9,244. He admitted that state tax liens were filed against him,
but he was not certain of the tax years upon which the liens were based. In December
2018, State A tax department asked him to start a payment plan. His 2016 and 2017 state
taxes  were  overpaid,  and  the  refunds  from  those  tax  years  were  applied  to  offset  the
unpaid tax balance. Beginning in January 2019, Applicant agreed to pay $1,000 every
month, and he paid faithfully until November 2019, when all State A tax liens were fully
satisfied. (Tr. 22, 71-82; GE 5; AE J, AE K, AE N)
