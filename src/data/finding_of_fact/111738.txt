Applicant  is  a  62-year-old  heavy  equipment  operator  for  a  defense  contractor,
employed since December 2017. Applicant previously worked as a teacher and coach for
17 years, and a school principal for two years before retiring from education in 1999. He
then started a business in farm and home construction. He received a bachelor’s degree
in 1981 and a master’s degree in 1987. He married in 1976, but his spouse died in 2003.
He remarried in 2005 and divorced in 2008. He again married in 2016. He has three adult
children, none of whom live with him. He has never held a final security clearance.
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  has  a  $10,901  judgment,  with  a  balance  owed  of
$21,058 including post-judgment penalties, fees, and interest. The Government’s exhibits
and Applicant’s Answer and testimony support the SOR allegation.
Applicant  purchased  a  truck  in  2001,  and  financed  it  through  an  auto  company
creditor. Following the purchase, he began to have significant problems with the truck,
including  blown  spark  plugs,  three  brake  replacements  within  30,000  miles,  and  fuel
system problems. He was unsuccessful in having the vehicle declared a lemon, and was
unable  to  get  support  from  the  dealer.  In  2003,  he  gave  up  the  truck  in  a  voluntarily
repossession with 45,000 miles on it, and it was sold at auction. That was the same year
his spouse passed away.
In 2005, the lender sent Applicant an invoice for about $10,000. He contacted the
lender in 2006, and offered to settle. The lender told Applicant that the loan had been
forgiven,  but  offered  new  financing  to  purchase  another vehicle. He  accepted  the  new
loan for $28,000, and purchased another truck. Applicant believed the debt was resolved
at that time. He paid off his second and a third loan, and did not hear from the lender
again.
In 2017, Applicant was served with a writ of garnishment issued against him for
$19,802 that resulted from a 2011 judgment to collect $11,040 from his original truck loan.
The  garnishment  order  included  penalties,  fees,  and  interest  on  the  original  judgment
amount.  He  was  never  notified  of  the  judgment  proceedings,  did  not  participate  in  a
judicial proceeding, and was unaware of the garnishment proceeding until he was served
with the writ of garnishment. By November 2018, the balance due became $21,058 with
interest accruing at 8.75% per year.
Applicant believes the account to be a resurrected “ghost” account, obtained by a
collection  agent  and  enforced  by  obtaining  a  judgment.  In  2017,  Applicant’s  employer
garnished his wages, and paid $7,000 over five months. Applicant attempted to contact
the  collection  agent,  but  was  unable  to  talk to  a  person.  He  again tried  in  2018,  but  a
recording directs inquiries to an online site. An attorney for the collection agent contacted
Applicant in November 2018, and offered to discuss a payment plan. Applicant spoke to
an attorney in 2019, who suggested he obtain the district court documents. He obtained
the documents and is awaiting the attorney’s review.
Applicant  provided  an  article  from  a  free  online  credit  repair  advice  site  that
described the collection agent as a “junk buyer that buys up old debt from the banks, . . .
for pennies on the dollar. They have a history of unscrupulous debt collection practices.”
Another  article  noted  that  the  collection  agent  was  sued  in  a  class  action  suit  in  2014
claiming the agent engaged in several improper debt collection practices, including suing
debtors without sufficient evidence, making false statements in court documents, and not
providing  notice  to  defendants  while  representing  to  the  court  that  they  had.  Between
2005 and 2007, the agent filed 60,000 mass debt collections in New York City, and won
48,000 judgments. In one week, they sued 1,200 persons alone. However, only 6% of the
defendants  appeared  in  court.  The  agent  settled  the  class  action  suit,  paid  nearly  $4
million into a fund for class members, and agreed to stop related collection actions.
The judgment and garnishment order do not appear on Applicant’s credit report.
He has sufficient income and assets to pay the account, but believes it was fraudulently
obtained  and  is  awaiting  his  attorney’s  advice.  Applicant  earns  about  $56,000  net
annually and receives a state retirement paying about $10,000 annually. He has about
$1,700 net remainder per month. He has $2,000 in savings, and owns outright a home,
farm, two rental homes, motor home, four vehicles, and farm equipment. With Applicant’s
background in construction, he volunteered to build low income houses for church and
charitable  organizations.  Applicant  provided  several  character  letters  from  previous
trustworthiness,  and
supervisors  and  coworkers,  all  attesting
professionalism.
