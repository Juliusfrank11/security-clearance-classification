Applicant is 44 years old. He divorced his wife of six years in 2003. He has been
married to his second wife since 2005. He has four minor children. He served honorably
on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  1994  through  2001,  and  from  2005  until  August
2008, when he was medically discharged for reasons not specified in the record. From
2001 through 2005, he was on inactive reserve duty. He was previously granted a DOD
security clearance in 2007. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2015. Applicant has been
employed by the same defense contractor since March 2016. (Item 2)
The SOR alleged Applicant’s 11 delinquent debts totaling approximately $32,977,
and  that he deliberately  failed  to  disclose  any  of them  on  his SCA.  Applicant admitted
each of the alleged debts, which remain unresolved. I construed his failure to respond to
the falsification allegation as a denial of any deliberate intent to falsify his SCA.
The  SOR  debts  were  confirmed  by  his  November  2016  and  April  2019  credit
reports. The  November 2016  credit  report revealed  that 10  of  the 11  SOR  debts  were
then in delinquent status, including: 1) one past due since January 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.e); 2)
four  in  charged-off  status,  including  one  since  March  2014  (SOR  ¶  1.d),  one  since
February 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.f), and two since May 2016 (SOR  ¶¶ 1.b, 1.h); and  3) five in
collection  status  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  1.g,  1.i,  1.j,  1.k).  The  last  dates  of  activity  for  the
collection debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.k were reported as March 2015,
June  2015,  August  2015,  and  July  2014,  respectively.  The  April  2019  credit  report
revealed that the mortgage-loan debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a was then approximately 30
days delinquent. (Items 4, 5)
Applicant  certified  his  “no”  responses  to  whether  he  had  any  financial
delinquencies  on  his  SCA  in  July  2016.  He  was  interviewed  in  September  2018  in
connection with his security-clearance investigation to discuss the contents of his SCA.
During  his interview,  Applicant  initially  reaffirmed  his “no” response.  He  acknowledged
his delinquent debts only after  being confronted with 10 of the 11 debts alleged in the
SOR. He provided inconsistent explanations for his failure to  list them on his SCA. He
asserted  that  “he  was  not  aware  of”  all  of  the  accounts  with  which  he  had  been
confronted. Then, he averred  that his omissions  were  an  “oversight.” He  asserted  that
he  planned  to  contact  his  creditors  and  make  arrangements  to  resolve  his  delinquent
accounts within 90 days.  He maintained that he was  current with his ongoing financial
obligations and living “at or below his means.” (Item 3 at 5-6)
During  the  interview,  Applicant  attributed  his  financial  situation  primarily  to  a
period  of  underemployment  following  a  job  change.  He  did  not  specify  a  timeline  or
provide  further  details.  He  explained  that  he  began  to  accumulate  debt  “around  the
time” that he changed jobs. He was late on payments before the job change, and then
fell  further  behind  because  his  income  decreased  following  the  change.  He  became
“overwhelmed” by his bills and struggled to make the monthly payments to his creditors.
After being confronted during the interview,  he acknowledged that  he withdrew money
from his 401k in June 2016 to “pay bills,” the amount of which was $11,900 after taxes.
He did not specify how that money was allocated. (Item 3 at 5-6)
The  employment  history  on  Applicant’s  SCA  revealed
two  periods  of
unemployment.  The  first  was  from  August  2008  through  January  2009,  following  his
military discharge. The second was from February 2016 through March 2016, after his
defense-contractor  employer  lost  the  contract  on  which  he  was  working.  He  has
otherwise  been  employed  full  time  since  January  2009. The  record  did not  enumerate
his relevant income and expense history. (Item 2 at 10-16)
