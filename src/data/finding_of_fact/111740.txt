In his SOR answer, Applicant denied that he failed to file his 2016 and 2017 federal
and  state  tax  returns  as  required,  but  he  admitted  that  he  owed  state  taxes.  He  also
admitted the eight other debts alleged in the SOR under Guideline F. Under Guideline H,
he admitted five of the six allegations regarding his history using marijuana, but denied
that he intended to continue using marijuana in the future (SOR ¶ 2.c). I have incorporated
his admissions in my findings of fact. Applicant’s personal information is extracted from
his  SCA  unless  otherwise  indicated  by  a  parenthetical  citation  to  the  record.  After  a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony at the hearing, and
the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant,  51,  has  worked  as  a  senior  consultant  for  a  Federal  Government
contractor since 2014 and earns a significant salary. Prior to that he worked for another
government contractor for eight years. He has held a security clearance since at least
2006.  Applicant  earned  an  associate’s  degree  and  a  bachelor’s  degree.  He  started
college at age 14 and earned his bachelor’s degree at age 19. He has been married since
1998, and they have a 15-year-old child. Applicant also has two adult stepchildren. (Tr.
62-65.)
Applicant and his wife have experienced serious medical issues in recent years
and have incurred large medical bills that have strained their finances. In his 2017 SCA,
Applicant disclosed certain debts of which he was aware. He also disclosed his history of
using  marijuana  while  holding  a  security  clearance  and  three  arrests  for  minor  drug
offenses during the period 2002 through 2007. (Tr. 35-56, 87-88.)
Guideline F (Financial Considerations)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, Failure to File 2016 and 2017 Federal and State Tax Returns as
Required - Applicant denies these allegations. He attached to his SOR answer copies of
his 2016 and 2017 federal and state income tax returns, which he wrote were timely filed.
After the hearing, he provided federal tax return transcripts for both years. The transcripts
establish that he and his wife timely filed their federal returns and received refunds in both
years.  Applicant  has  refuted  these  SOR  allegations  as  erroneous.  The  basis  of  the
allegations is a miscommunication during his background interview and an error in the
investigator’s report of investigation. (GE 2 at 4-5; AE D, AE E; Tr. 27, 37-40.)
SOR ¶ 1.c, State Tax Debt in the approximate amount of $9,000 for Tax Years 2013-
2015 – Applicant admits this allegation, but states that in June 2018 he has entered into
a payment plan to pay $500 per month to resolve it. Applicant attached a copy of a letter
from his state with a copy of his payment plan. The agreement recites that Applicant owed
back taxes for tax years 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017 in the amount of $5,941, plus interest
and penalties, for a total amount of $7,644. He presently owes less than $5,000.
In 2015, he and his wife had entered into a payment plan with their state and had
reduced their tax debt with payments for a couple of years. His wife, however, stopped
making  the  payments  because  of  their  large  medical  expenses.  She  did  this  without
advising  Applicant.  At  that  time,  she  was  solely  responsible  for  managing  the  family’s
finances. Under the current payment plan, they have paid three monthly installments and
their back taxes will be paid off in 2020. The underlying reason for the delinquency is the
multi-state taxation of Applicant’s income and his use of the refunds from one state to pay
the taxes owed in a second state. Applicant’s wife diverted the refunds and used them for
other purposes. She then failed to pay all of their taxes in the second state where they
reside. (AE G at 1-2; AE B at 7; Tr. 11, 40-43, 45-48; 87-91, 94.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.k, Unpaid Medical Collection Accounts Totaling
about  $3,750  -  Applicant  was  unaware  of  these  accounts  before  his  April  2018
background  interview.  Since  then,  he  has  resolved  most  of  these  debts.  He  provided
evidence from the creditor identified in SOR ¶ 1.d, dated September 11, 2019, that this
debt was paid. He also provided evidence of payment from the creditors identified in SOR
¶¶ 1.h, and 1.k. (GE 1 at 34-38; GE 2 at 5-6; AE A at 1, 3, 6; Tr. at 54-55, 57-58.)
Applicant provided no evidence that he had resolved the debts owed to a creditor
that are alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.f ($197) and 1.g ($97), even though he was able to provide
evidence  of  his  resolution  of  another  debt  owed  to  the  same  creditor  (SOR  ¶  1.h),  as
noted above. He provided evidence of his payment of a fourth debt ($218) owed to this
creditor, which was not alleged in the SOR. Neither the account number nor the amount
of that debt matches the account number and debt amount alleged in either SOR ¶¶ 1.f
or 1.g. Applicant claims that the unalleged debt for $218 was the only outstanding debt
he had with that creditor and that he paid it. In addition, he was unable to resolve the debt
of $49 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i. Applicant’s June 2017 credit report, which was the basis of
that  SOR  allegation,  provides  insufficient  information  to  identify  and  pay  this  creditor.
None of these three debts appears in GE 7, the Government’s May 2019 credit report, or
in Applicant’s more recent credit reports. (GE 7 at 6; AE A at 4, GE 8; AE F; Tr. at 11, 56-
57.)
SOR ¶ 1.e, July 2016 Judgment in the Amount of $648 – Applicant was also unaware
of this debt when he was interviewed by a Government investigator. He testified that he
had resolved this judgment, and that his wife could provide details. His wife testified, but
offered no information about this particular debt. Applicant and his wife failed to follow up
on their intention to provide evidence about the payment of this judgment. The debt no
longer appears on either the May 2019 credit report or on Applicant’s two credit reports.
If the judgment was still unresolved, it would have been listed on at least one of these
credit reports, which supports Applicant’s testimony that this judgment has been satisfied.
(GE 2 at 6; GE 4; GE 7 at 4; GE 8; AE F; Tr. at 55-56.)
SOR ¶ 1.j, Collection Account for a Defaulted Bank Loan in the Amount of $1,133 –
Applicant was unaware of this collection account at the time of his background interview.
In about June 2017, his wife defaulted on this bank loan. He resolved this account with a
payment in June 2019 in the amount of $577.86, as evidenced by a letter in the record
from the bank’s collection agency. (GE 2 at 6; GE 7 at 6; AE A at 2.)
To avoid a repetition of unpaid bills in the future, Applicant is now reviewing his
family’s  bills  with  his  wife.  In  addition,  his  wife  has  learned  an  important  lesson  about
being  completely  candid  with  him.  Her  expressions  of  remorse  over  this  situation
emphasized her commitment to avoid this problem in the future. They have not sought
financial counseling, though he said they planned to do so. He has provided no evidence
of that. (Tr. at 58-61, 106.)
Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
SOR ¶¶ 2.a through 2.c, Marijuana Use from 1999 through at least 2015 – Applicant
first experimented with marijuana when he was in college at age 16 or 17. He smoked
marijuana sporadically in his 20s and 30s on social occasions. That changed when he
was diagnosed with a serious illness in 2006. He was 38 at that time. Every three years
or so, he experiences exacerbations that last for one to three weeks.  He started using
marijuana to reduce the spasms and pain that he experienced during these periods. His
physician also advised him that smoking marijuana would reduce the side effects of the
drug he took for his illness during these intense periods of his disease. The state in which
he resides has enacted a “medical marijuana” law,  but Applicant has never obtained a
prescription or the equivalent to buy marijuana under that law. (GE 1 at 31; GE 2 at 4; GE
9; Tr. 12-13, 17, 53, 65-84.)
In  his  January  2017  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  his  past  marijuana  use  during
periods when he held a security clearance. In response to a question about his future use
of an illegal drug, he wrote: “In all honesty, if I get another exacerbation, there is a good
chance that I will use marijuana again to help alleviate the effects.” In mid-2017, Applicant
last  used  marijuana  to  ease  his  suffering  from  his  illness.  At  that  point,  he  made  a
commitment to himself that he would no longer continue to use marijuana for any reason.
In his April 2018 background interview, he stated that he has ceased all use of marijuana
and does not intend to use the drug in the future. At the hearing, he identified a mistake
in  the  interview  summary  in  a  sentence  that  was  inconsistent  with  his  prior  statement
about his future intentions regarding the use of marijuana. He also submitted a letter of
intent  to  abstain  from  all  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse.  In  his  letter,  he
acknowledged that any future drug involvement or substance misuse would be grounds
for revocation of his national security eligibility, if granted. (GE 1 at 31; GE 2 at 4; GE 9;
Attachment to SOR Answer; Tr. at 12-13, 17-18, 53, 79-84.)
After  receiving  the  SOR,  Applicant  enrolled  in  an  intensive  outpatient  drug
treatment program. The program last two months, from July 8, 2019, to September 12,
2019.  He  submitted  as  evidence  a  letter  from  the  program  that  provides  a  favorable
prognosis “for long-term sobriety.” The letter also states that Applicant has committed to
abstain from all substances, including alcohol. Applicant has, in fact, abstained from both
marijuana and alcohol since entering this program and is committed to living a substance-
free life. (AE C; Tr. at 79-84.)
SOR ¶¶ 2.d through 2.f, Marijuana Charges in 2002 and Twice in 2007 – In his SOR
answer, Applicant admitted that he was charged with marijuana-related crimes on three
occasions, once in 2002, and again in October and December 2007. He pleaded guilty to
the  first  offense  and  was  sentenced  to  serve  one  year  on  probation.  He  possessed
marijuana in 2007 because he was using marijuana to mitigate a period of particularly
bad  flare-ups  of  his  illness  following  his  2006  diagnosis.  He  pleaded  guilty  to  the  first
offense in 2007 and was fined. The charges in the second offense were dropped. (GE 1
at 28-29.)
Applicant submitted six character reference letters as well as two letters from his
wife.  These  letters  provide  strong  support for  Applicant’s  trustworthiness,  honesty  and
integrity. He is a trusted and valued member of a team supporting a DOD component. In
her letters, his wife accepted full responsibility for the financial issues raised in the SOR.
She  referenced  the  extraordinary  expenses  they  have  incurred  for Applicant’s  medical
treatment and the treatment of her serious condition, which interfered with her ability for
a  period  to  continue  paying  the  monthly  installments  on  their  initial  state  tax  payment
agreement. She also wrote that she and Applicant are current with all of their bills and
live modestly in a rental home. (AE A; AE G.)
