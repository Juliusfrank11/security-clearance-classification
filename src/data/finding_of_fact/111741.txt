In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  denied  one  medical  account  ($840)  and
indicated that five delinquent accounts were duplication of other delinquent debts. She
admitted the other delinquent accounts listed in the SOR. After a thorough review of the
testimony, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  59-year-old  risk  management  team  lead  who  has  worked  for  a
defense contractor since July 2000 and seeks to retain a security clearance. (Tr. 16, Ex.
1)  A  top  secret  clearance  was  issued  to  her  in  1996.  (Tr.  17)  In  June  1995,  Applicant
divorced following a ten-year marriage. (Tr. 19, Ex. 1) She has two children ages 29 and
31. (Tr. 18) She has not served in the military. Her annual salary is $132,000. (Tr. 23, 64)
She also has a part-time job doing photography. (Tr. 24) She anticipates a five percent
raise this year, the same percentage as she received last year. (Tr. 73)
Between  2011  and  mid-2015,  Applicant  was  the  primary  breadwinner  for  her
household,  which  consisted  of  her  two  children,  her  mother  who  suffered  from
dementia/Alzheimer’s, her mother’s grandson who had been under her mother’s care and
her sister, her sister’s two children, and her sister’s grandson. (Tr. 19) In May 2004, her
mother and her mother’s grandson moved in with her. (Tr. 44) In 2011, Applicant, who
was  timely  in  paying  her  bills,  began  reading  up  on  credit.  (Tr.  52)  She  then  started
acquiring  credit  cards.  Most  of  the  credit  cards  listed  as  SOR  delinquents  debts  were
acquired by Applicant between 2012 and 2014. (Ex. 4, 5, 6) Her mother’s and her sister’s
income were included in the household income to meet the household’s expenses. Her
mother’s income consisted of a pension and social security benefits. (Tr. 44) When her
mother died in January 2015, and her sister moved out of the home, Applicant realized
she could not pay her debts. (Tr. 20) She paid her mother’s funeral expenses. (Tr. 67)
Applicant  now  lives  in  her  home  alone.  (Tr.  57)  She  helps  her  sister  financially
when  she  can.  Her  sister  is  66  years  old,  lives  on  a  fixed  income,  and  suffers  from
pancreatic cancer. (Tr. 70) Every Friday, Applicant takes time off from work to take her
sister to her chemotherapy and radiation treatment and give her sister’s children a break.
(Tr. 71) She provides her sister approximately $100 each month in financial support.
In August 2018, Applicant provided an enhanced subject interview during which
her delinquent finances were discussed. (Ex. 4, Tr. 54) During that interview, she said
she was “very prideful” and chose not to ask for help with her credit issues because she
thought  that  as  an  adult  she  should  be  able  to  handle  her finances.  (Tr.  20)  She  was
current  on her mortgage  and  car payments.  She  was  also paying  on one  of  the  credit
cards.  Her  mortgage  caused  her  some  financial  stress  in  that  her  monthly  mortgage
payments began going up $100 per month each year, and one year her payments jumped
$250  per  month.  (Tr.  20)  Her  monthly  mortgage  payment  is  currently  $2,249.  (Tr.  23)
During the summer, her electric bill can run $2,500 per month. (Tr. 23)
Applicant considered selling her home and using the equity in the home to address
her debts. However, she would have then had to buy a smaller home with a loan requiring
repayment similar to her current mortgage payments. (Tr. 21) She also considered selling
her  home  and  moving  in  temporarily  with  her  daughter.  She  owes  approximately
$202,000 on her home that has a fair market value of $320,000. (Tr. 22) She purchased
her home in 2011. She had purchased the home in cooperation with her then boyfriend.
They  anticipated  marriage,  and  she  counted  on  both  incomes  to  meet  her  mortgage
payments, utility bills, and other living expenses. When the relationship ended, Applicant
was left having to pay the household expenses on her income alone.
Applicant acknowledges she could have and should have made better decisions
concerning her finances. (Tr. 108) However, she takes responsibility for her actions and
intends to pay her debts. She provided extensive details about her debts, showing that
she is fully aware of her financial situation. (Tr. 109) Department Counsel conceded that
when she did act to address her debts, “she acted with great earnest in attempting [to
address] these accounts.” (Tr. 110) He also acknowledged Applicant was forthright about
her past and providing details of her financial difficulties. (Tr. 110)
Applicant plans to retire in four or five years and does not want to enter retirement
with  large  debts.  (Tr.  22,  53)  She  is  keenly  aware  she  could  lose  her  job  due  to  her
delinquent  financial  obligations.  (Tr. 53)  Last  year,  she  attended  budgeting  workshops
through her sorority. (Tr. 25, 63) She has access through her church to the Dave Ramsey
Peace  University  financial  studies  books.  She  has  started  a  budget,  but  believes  she
needs additional guidance to help her through her financial problems. Applicant sought
legal services to assist her with her financial problems. After being quoted $21,000 for the
services, she declined to hire the attorney. She decided if she had $21,000, she would
rather apply those funds to her debts. (Tr. 37)
Applicant  completed  two  extensive  spread  sheets  listing  all  her  debts  and  the
actions she has taken to address those debts. (Ex. C, Ex. Y) She listed the telephone
numbers called, the people she talked with, the repayment agreements that have been
made,  and  included  those  debts  where  she  has  yet  to  reach  agreements  with  the
creditors. She is mindful of not overextending herself by entering into too many repayment
agreements at this time. (Tr. 83) Details of her efforts to address the SOR debts follow.
Applicant owed a collection agency $4,198 on a bank collection debt (SOR 1.a).
She reached a repayment agreement with the creditor to make 13 payments of $50 each
and 24 payments of $150. (Ex. A) Since May 2019, she has made her monthly payments
in  a  timely  manner.  (Tr.  27)  The  payments  are  automatically  deducted  from  her  bank
account. (Tr. 28) As of March 2020, the current balance was $3,697. (Ex. Y, Ex. Z)
Applicant also owed $2,978 on a charged-off credit card account (SOR 1.e). She
reached an agreement with the law firm collecting the debt whereby she agreed to make
13 payments of $50 and 14 payments of $150. (Ex. E) In June 2019, she started making
payments, and by April 2020 the balance on the debt had been reduced to $1,724. (Ex.
C, Ex. Y, Ex. Z)
Applicant reached an agreement with this same law firm to address another SOR
debt.  She  agreed  to  make  13  monthly  payments  of  $50  and  7  payments  of  $150  to
address a $1,672 collection account (SOR 1.n). (Ex. N) She started making her payments
in  June  2019.  (Ex.  N,  Tr.  30)  As  of  April  2020,  the  balance  on  the  account  had  been
reduced to $820. (Ex. Y, Ex. Z) She credibly asserts the debt in SOR 1.n and SOR 1.p
are the same obligation. (Ex. Y) She also has made payments to the same law firm to
resolve a $1,091 department store debt (SOR 1.s). In November 2019, the judgment on
this debt was released. (Ex. S, Tr. 30)
Applicant owed a collection agency $2,658 on a bank collection debt (SOR 1.g).
She reached a repayment agreement with the creditor to make $50 monthly payments on
the debt. (Tr. 29, Ex. Y) She started making payments in May 2019. (Ex. G) As of March
2020, the balance was $2,131. (Ex. Z) She reached agreement with the same collection
agency to make payments on four other SOR debts. In June 2019, she started  paying
$13.96 monthly on an $838 collection debt (SOR 1.t). (Ex. T-1, T-2, Tr. 31) As of March
2020,  the  balance  was  $712.  (Ex.  BB)  In  June  2019,  she  also  started  making  $12.62
monthly payments on a $758 collection debt (SOR 1.u). (Ex. U, Tr. 32) As of April 2020,
the balance on the account was $644. (Ex. Y, Ex. BB) At the same time, she also started
making $12.58 monthly payments on a $755 collection debt (SOR 1.v). (Ex. V, Tr. 32) As
of April 2020, the balance on the account was $666. (Ex. Y, Ex. BB) The payments on
the  debts  in  SOR  1.t,  1.u,  and  1.v  are  made  by  automatic  deduction  from  her  bank
account. (Tr. 31) In June, July, and August 2019, she made three payments of $120.85
each to pay off the $363 bank collection account (SOR 1.w). (Ex. W, Ex. Y, Tr. 32)
Applicant resolved the $2,327 collection account that was originally owed an on-
line retailer (SOR 1.i). The accounts numbers verify the collection account  listed in the
SOR was the same account as the on-line seller’s account. As of June 2019, this account
had been paid leaving a zero balance. (Ex. I, Tr. 29) She reached an agreement with the
collection  firm  collecting  the  $1,753  (SOR  1.m)  debt,  whereby  starting  in  July  2019,
$62.50 would be automatically deducted monthly from her bank account bi-weekly. (Ex.
M, Tr. 30) The debt balance as of April 2020 was $682. (Ex. Y) She asserts the debt listed
in  SOR  1.m  is  the  same  debt  as  SOR  1.o,  for  which  she  has  arranged  a  repayment
agreement. (Tr. 31) All three debts are being collected by the same collection agency for
the same bank.
Regarding the alleged medical debts, Applicant incurred a medical emergency at
work. Her blood pressure was very high, and she also had vertigo. It was thought she
was  having  a  heart  attack.  (Tr.  33)  She  was  taken  by  ambulance  to  the  hospital  for
treatment. She paid the $425 medical debt (SOR 1.dd). (Ex. DD) She also paid $315 to
settle the $360 medical bill (SOR 1.x). (Ex. B, Tr. 32) She disputes the $840 medical debt
(SOR  1.cc)  for  dental  work.  After  x-rays  were  taken,  she  was  informed  the  dental
treatment  would  cost $8,000.  She  decided not  to  have the  procedures done.  (Tr.  101)
She  had  dental  insurance  to  cover  the  cost  of  the  x-rays.  (Ex.  Y)  The  bill for  services
rendered will be paid once the proper paperwork is submitted. (Tr. 34, 101)
The $5,900 loan (SOR 1.z) was paid. (Ex. D, Tr. 35) She had obtained the personal
loan with a now ex-boyfriend, when she moved into her home, and she paid it over the
course of five years. (Tr. 36, 91) Her April 2019 credit report lists a zero balance for this
account. (Ex. 6) She paid the $116 charged-off telephone service account (SOR 1.y) (Ex.
Y, Tr. 91)
Applicant has not made any payments toward some accounts, including the $3,422
charged-off account listed in SOR 1.d, which is likely duplicated in SOR 1.bb. (Tr. 39, 77)
Department Counsel acknowledged the $4,087 charged-off account in SOR 1.b and the
$4,087 charged-off account in SOR 1.aa are the same debt. (Tr. 96) Her plan is to address
debts and any additional debts that are not currently in a repayment plan as soon as those
debts being repaid through established plans have been satisfied. (Tr. 57, 76) The $2,848
charged-off  account  (SOR  1.f),  $2,422  (SOR  1.h)  collection  account,  and  the  $1,821
charged-off account (SOR 1.l) are to be included in the next round of payments (phase II
of her payment plans).  (Ex.  Y, Tr. 99)  Her  plan  is  to  address  the  smaller debts  before
attempting  to  pay  the  larger  debts.  (Tr.  100)  She  asserted  the  debt  listed  in  SOR  1.c
($3,590) may also be a duplicate debt, but provided no proof that the debt is otherwise
alleged  in  the  SOR.  (Tr.  76)  Since  December  2019,  she  has  made  eight  payments  of
$62.50 each on this debt. (Ex. AA)
The same collection agency attempting to collect the debt listed in SOR 1.c is also
collecting seven other SOR debts. Applicant contacted the collection agency and was told
the collection agency no longer holds the debt listed in SOR 1.c. She is talking with the
collection agency to consolidate the accounts held by the agency so that she can make
a single payment. (Ex. Y)
Applicant  made  two  monthly  $50  payments  on  the  $2,013  charged-off  bank
account (SOR 1.k). (Ex. CC, Tr. 81) She never received a statement from the creditor
following  her payments,  so  she  stopped making  payments.  (Tr.  83) She  contacted the
bank concerning the debt on learning from the collection entity that it no longer held the
debt. (Tr. 83) If contacted by a new collection agency, she intends to arrange a repayment
plan. She was also making $50 monthly payments on a $1,278 department store account
(SOR  1.q).  (Tr.  87)  She  believes  the  debt  has  been  transferred  to  another  collection
agency.  Applicant  asserted  she  had  cancelled  checks  showing  payments  on  this  debt
and on the $1,265 charged-off department store account (SOR 1.r). (Ex. CC, Tr. 89) She
made a few payments before stopping because she received no acknowledgement of her
payments. However, the checks she sent were processed. (Tr. 90)
Applicant acknowledges that she should have taken prompt action to resolve her
debts following her August 2018 subject interview, but she felt overwhelmed. (Tr. 56) She
found the SOR to be a wake-up call that led her to realize that she had to get her finances
under control. She now maintains only a single credit card, and she makes timely monthly
payments on that account. (Tr. 60)
Applicant asserts she is current on her $537 monthly car payment. As of April 2020,
the balance owed on her loan is approximated $1,000. (Ex. II) The car will be paid off in
two months, providing her with an additional $537 of monthly disposable income. (Tr. 42,
106) She has approximately $300,000 in her company’s 401(k) retirement account. (Tr.
66) She had obtained a $10,000 loan from her 401(k) account to pay her mother’s funeral
expenses. She has been repaying the loan at $156 monthly for the last five years. (Tr.
105) The debt will be shortly paid in full leaving her with $156 more in monthly disposable
income. She has filed her income tax returns in a timely manner. Last year, she received
a tax refund of a few thousand dollars, which she applied to her debts. (Tr. 102)
Applicant has always been responsible at work, ensuring that deadlines are timely
met.  (Tr.  58)  Applicant’s  2019  performance  form  shows  that  she  was  rated  as  having
exceeded  the  position’s  requirements.  (Ex.  EE)  Her  2018  performance  form  shows  a
rating  of  having  exceeded  expectations.  (Ex.  EE).  In  October  2018,  she  received  a
“Recognition Thanks Award” and a “Recognition Kudos Award” from her employer. (Ex.
FF) In October 2019, she was recognized for her leadership and in January 2020, she
received  another  “Recognition  Kudos  Award.”  (Ex.  FF)  She  is  also  active  in  volunteer
work at her work place. (Ex. HH)
Character Statement
A  criminal  district  court  judge,  who  has  known  Applicant  for  12  years,  stated
Applicant is “constantly on the go with individuals and groups as a volunteer who gives
back to the community at large which makes her leadership evident both internally within
our organization as well as externally within the surrounding communities.” (Ex. GG) He
stated  Applicant  displays  outstanding  character, loyalty,  trustworthiness,  dependability,
and  reliability.  He  also  stated  Applicant  is  an  articulate  and  dynamic  woman  with  high
integrity, good moral character, and dedicated to the community she serves. (Ex. GG)
