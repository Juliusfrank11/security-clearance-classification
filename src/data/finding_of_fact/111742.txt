The amended SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant filed for a Chapter 13
bankruptcy in about January 2019, which was still pending as of May 14, 2019 (SOR ¶
1.a); and that Applicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2015
and 2016, and owed at least $9,288 in delinquent federal taxes as of May 14, 2019 (SOR ¶
1.b). Under Guideline D, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested in September 2016 for
lewdness, open and gross; accost or annoy another person; and indecent exposure (SOR
¶ 2.a).
When  Applicant  answered  the  SOR  allegations,  he  admitted  the  Chapter  13
bankruptcy  filing,  but  explained  that  his  divorce  caused  financial  strain  and  negatively
impacted his children’s emotional and physical health. He also acknowledged that he had
not filed his federal income tax returns on time for tax years 2015 and 2016 due to his
divorce,  but  they  were  filed  in  January  2019.  His  tax  indebtedness  was  being  repaid
through his Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan, and he had made several months of payments
under the plan. In response to the Guideline D allegation, Applicant explained that his
accuser was an underage female friend of one of his daughters and that the allegations of
sexual misconduct were proven to be completely false, as evidenced by the dismissal of
the charges. (Answer.) After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcripts, I make the
following findings of fact:
Applicant is 58 years old. He has been married and divorced three times. He and his
third wife married in October 1995 and divorced in September 2013 because of domestic
violence  between  his  ex-wife  and  the  oldest  of  their  three  daughters.  He  indicated  in
response to the SOR that his ex-wife was arrested in December 2009 and removed from
the marital home because of domestic violence, and that over the next two years, he spent
thousands of dollars as a court-appointed guardian ad litem investigated and gave him
physical custody of their daughters. Additionally, he incurred the costs of therapy for their
daughters, although he did not elaborate as to the extent of those costs. Their daughters
are now ages 19, 17, and 15, and they live with him. He has a 36-year-old son from his first
marriage and a 33-year-old daughter from his second marriage. He has had no contact
with them in years. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 39-40.)
Applicant served honorably on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from August 1979 to
August 1983. He then served in the U.S. Amy from March 1984 until June 1984, when he
was separated under other than honorable conditions. (GE 1.) He explained that he was
separated after he reported his training officer for hitting other people, but he would not
elaborate any further because his records are “sealed.” (GE 2.) Applicant then enlisted in
the  U.S.  Marine  Corps  and  served  honorably  from  May  1985  to  May  1989.  He
subsequently served honorably in the Air National Guard (ANG) from May 1996 until he
retired as a senior master sergeant in February 2011. He was called to active duty for the
Air  Force  and  deployed  from  February  2002  to  November  2002.  (GE  1;  AEs  G-J,  L.)
Applicant was granted a DOD secret clearance in June 1997. He was first granted sensitive
compartmented information (SCI) access eligibility in April 2008 for his ANG duties. (GE 1.)
Applicant attended a community college from September 2007 to June 2008 while
working  full-time  for  the  ANG  as  an  information  technology  network  manager.  From
September  2008  to  June  2015,  Applicant  was  employed  as  a  systems  engineer  by  a
defense  contractor (company X). (GE 1; AE K.)  He took online classes part time from
September 2010 to March 2015, and earned his bachelor’s degree in May 2013 and his
master’s degree in March 2015. (GEs 1-2.)
In July 2015, Applicant began working as a project lead for a defense contractor at
an  Air  Force  base  located  a  considerable  distance  from  his  home.  In  June  2016,  he
became employed by the defense contractor that took over the contact. In December 2016,
he left that job for an information assurance position with company X at a worksite nearer
to  his  home.  (GE  1;  AE  K.)  While  in  that  position,  he  completed  and  certified  to  the
accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on May 17, 2017. He
listed a September 2016 criminal charge of indecent exposure, which was then in pretrial
proceedings. In response to the SF 86 inquiries into his financial record, he responded
negatively to a question concerning whether in the last seven years he had failed to file or
pay federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance. He also answered
“No” to inquiries into any delinquency involving routine accounts, but conversely responded
“Yes” to a question regarding whether he was currently seeking assistance for financial
difficulties, and stated:  “consolidation of debt due in part of divorce, a high mortgage until I
had an opportunity to refinance. Additional house repairs were needed.” Regarding efforts
to resolve his financial difficulties, he explained:
Since working with Freedom Debt Relief I have been paying down my debt
each  month  with  a  payment  of  $1,149  although  my  credit  score  was
negatively affected, the long term plan 36 months will bring my debt under
control. (GE 1.)
In July 2017, Applicant left his job with company X because he and his supervisor
“did not always see eye to eye and he wanted a different opportunity.” (GE 2; AE K.) In
August 2017, Applicant returned to work at the Air Force base under the employment of yet
another  defense  contractor.  His  resume  indicates  that  he  was  granted  a  top  secret
clearance and SCI access eligibility in 2017 (AE K), although he testified that he has held a
top secret clearance and SCI access eligibility since 2013. (Tr. 41-42.)
On April 12, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant acknowledged that he had not yet filed
his income tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016; that he owed delinquent debts; and
that he had been arrested for indecent exposure. (GE 2.) The salient details about these
issues follow.
Financial Considerations
Applicant and his third wife filed for divorce against each other in January 2010.
Their divorce became final in September 2013. They share legal custody of their three
daughters, for whom his ex-wife was ordered to pay child support of $293 per week starting
July 5, 2013. In their divorce settlement dated June 17, 2013, Applicant retained sole legal
title of the marital home purchased in September 2008 and became solely responsible for
paying the mortgage. His ex-wife was given half of his federal employee’s defined pension
plan for the portion of his benefits earned between October 1995 and March 2013. His
pension was to be divided by a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) prepared by a
professional with the costs for the QDRO to be shared equally. Applicant was required
within 90 days to pay $20,000 into his ex-wife’s retirement account and $8,500 towards the
marital debts. Applicant’s annual earnings totaled $121,825 in 2013 and $124,766 in 2014.
(AE A.)
In June 2015, Applicant refinanced the mortgage on his home, obtaining a 30-year
Department  of  Veteran’s Affairs  loan for $397,270 and lowering his monthly mortgage
payment obligation from $2,998 to $2,500. (GEs 5, 7; Tr. 46.) He paid off that loan through
a refinancing in January 2018 that lowered his monthly mortgage payment by another
$300. (GEs 5, 7.) Between 2015 and 2018, Applicant obtained several loans and credit
cards on which he defaulted in his payments (GE 7), despite more than $100,000 in annual
income each year ($118,661 in 2015, $108,039 in 2016, $115,198 in 2017, and $107,352
in 2018) and the premature withdrawal of retirement assets in 2016. (AE A.) Some of the
loans were obtained to pay for his divorce attorney. He testified that, by the time his divorce
was  finalized  in  2013,  his  attorney  cost  him  $59,000.  (Tr.  55-56.)  He  provided  no
documentation to corroborate that amount.
During his April 2018 OPM interview, Applicant did not dispute most of the adverse
credit information that was on his credit record but not reported by him on his SF 86. He
asserted that a March 2018 credit-card judgment for $1,294 had been settled for $850 (but
then included it as a $1,294 debt in a January 2019 bankruptcy filing). He admitted that he
had  not  paid  a  loan  charged  off  for  $6,566  in  May  2017;  two  loans  totaling  $15,242
charged off in October 2017; five consumer-credit debts totaling approximately $12,686
charged off in November 2017; and four credit-card accounts for $16,978 in collection
since 2017. He admitted that he had received collection notices for several of his past-due
debts.
Applicant also acknowledged that five federal student loans totaling some $63,518
had been placed for collection in November 2017 because of nonpayment. He had thought
they were in deferment until June 2018. He explained that he was under a repayment plan
for his federal student loans starting March 2018 and was making $325 monthly payments.
He claimed to not recognize two other debts: a charge-off for $1,344 from November 2017
and a collection debt of $1,186 from April 2017 (both debts are on his Chapter 13 petition).
Applicant also admitted to the investigator that he had not filed his federal income
tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016 because he was concerned he would owe taxes
and could not pay them. He wanted to catch up financially before filing them and indicated
during his OPM interview that he was in the process of filing his delinquent tax returns. (GE
2.)
Available  credit  information  from  August  2019  indicates  that  Applicant  stopped
paying on most of his consumer credit cards and personal loans in the summer of 2016.
He last paid on his federal student loans in July 2018. (GE 7.) Applicant explained to the
OPM investigator in April 2018 that he could not keep up with his finances after his divorce
from his third wife, given the loss of her annual income of approximately $80,000 annually,
and also having to pay a criminal lawyer about $10,000 to represent him for a September
2016 indecent exposure charge. He explained that he had used Freedom Debt Relief, a
credit-counseling service, from the fall of 2016 until June 2017 (Tr. 45), which helped him
consolidate and pay off some debts. (GE 2.) He paid Freedom Debt Relief about $1,000 a
month. (Tr. 44.) He expressed his intent to use a credit counseling service in the future to
help with his debts. He indicated that he was not able to meet all his financial obligations
on time. (GE 2.) Available evidence shows that $8,070 in delinquent debt was cancelled in
2017. (GE 5; AE A.)
At  his hearing,  Applicant  explained that he did not continue with Freedom Debt
Relief because “[he] had probably every appliance in [his] house break down from [his]
furnace to [his] tractor lawn mower to [his] washer and dryer to [his] refrigerator.” He gave
priority  to  keeping  his  house  functioning  rather  than  paying  on  his  delinquent  debts
because he did not want his children to be taken away from him. (Tr. 42-43.) He also
recalls that all three of his daughters may have been in orthodontic treatment at that time.
(Tr. 44.) He explained at his hearing that the divorce had “residual effect;” that there were
“so  may  things  that  weighted  [sic]  on  [his]  shoulders;”  but  he  admitted  he  made  “poor
choices,” such as $1,645 in retail credit charges at Victoria’s Secret. (Tr. 81.) When asked
about a credit card with an accumulated balance of $14,003 on his bankruptcy petition,
Applicant explained that it was for “appliances and stuff,” and for replacing carpeting with
hardwood flooring because of his children’s allergies. (Tr. 83-84.)
In August 2018, Applicant sought legal counsel for advice about dealing with his
debt. Four months later, he retained the services of the attorney at a fee of $4,000 to assist
him with a bankruptcy filing. After receiving a required briefing from an approved credit
counseling agency, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on January 31, 2019.
He listed an unsecured priority claim of $10,800 consisting of delinquent federal income
taxes ($3,800 for tax year 2015 and $7,000 for tax year 2016), and nonpriority claims of
$144,856, consisting of $66,232 in federal student loan debts and unsecured credit card
and loan debts totaling $78,624 (including some debts not discussed during his April 2018
interview).  Two  of  his  unsecured  creditors,  who  were  owed  $1,294  and  $6,741,  were
seeking judgments against him. Applicant listed as secured claims the $394,967 owed on
his mortgage and $20,775 owed on a car loan for a 2012 sport-utility vehicle. Applicant
listed monthly income of $7,935, which included $1,248 in child support and $6,327 in
take-home pay from his job as program manager with a defense contractor. His monthly
expenses included $2,130 for his mortgage, $550 for his car payment, and $335 for a
vehicle leased for his now 19-year-old daughter. With estimated monthly expenses totaling
$7,235, he reportedly had $700 in discretionary income with which to pay his creditors.
(GEs 3-5; AE A.)
On March 15, 2019, Applicant moved to amend his bankruptcy, in part to add under
Schedule D a claim for his daughter’s piano. The debt was brought to his attention when
the creditor asserted a claim in his bankruptcy. Under a new summary of his assets and
liabilities,  he  reported  that  he  owed  $19,964  in  priority  unsecured  claims  for  taxes;
$144,856 in nonpriority unsecured claims of which $66,232 was his federal student loans;
and secured claims of $428,310 (his car loan, mortgage, and $12,568 for his daughter’s
piano). He reported net income after expenses of $573 per month. He filed a Chapter 13
plan under which he proposed to pay $573 per month for 60 months. His mortgage, car
payment, and payment on a used piano for his daughter were to be paid directly to his
creditors rather than through the plan. His federal income tax delinquency of $9,288 for tax
years 2015 and 2016, state income tax debt of $760, $2,500 of his bankruptcy attorney’s
fees, and $340 in pre-petition arrearage on his car loan were to be paid in full under the
plan. His unsecured claims totaling $78,624, including the federal student loans, were to be
paid at a pro rata share of 12.42%. However, his federal student loans will survive the
bankruptcy discharge. (AE A.)
On  March  20,  2019,  Applicant  completed  a  post-petition  personal  financial
management  course  for  his  bankruptcy  filing,  and  he  made  a  payment  of  $700  to  the
bankruptcy trustee. Applicant filed amended Chapter 13 plans on May 14, 2019, and again
on June 5, 2019, which are not in the record. An order confirming his Chapter 13 plan was
entered on July 26, 2019. (GE 3.) As of August 5, 2019, 25 creditor claims had been filed
totaling $587,195, which included $429,470 in secured claims and $9,050 in priority claims
(federal and state taxes). Of his $157,674 in unsecured claims, $68,206 is his student loan
debt. (AE A.) Bankruptcy payment records show he has made monthly payments of $575
to the trustee from April 2019 through January 2020. He testified he made his payment for
February 2020 as well. (AE E; Tr. 47.) Applicant testified that he has not been late in any
debt payments since he filed his bankruptcy petition in late January 2019. (Tr. 84-85.)
Available credit information from August 2019 indicates that he had been chronically late in
making  his  car  payment  from  September  2017  through  January  2019.  His  mortgage
payments  have  been  made  on  time,  although  his  mother  and  sister  helped  him  by
contributing about $700 so that he could make his $2,200 mortgage payment for February
2020 when he was unemployed. (GE 7; Tr. 45, 48-50.)
Applicant’s federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2015 were completed
by a tax preparer on April 12, 2017, but not submitted by Applicant until late February 2019
or early March 2019, after his non-filing came to the attention of the bankruptcy court. His
federal return for 2015 was received by the IRS on March 5, 2019. For tax year 2015, his
adjusted gross income was $136,186. He reported underpayments of $1,121 in federal
income taxes and $472 in state income taxes for tax year 2015. As of June 17, 2019, he
owed the IRS $1,777 for tax year 2015. His federal and state income tax returns for tax
year 2016 were completed by a tax preparer in January 2019. His federal income tax return
for 2016 was received by the IRS on February 21, 2019. His adjusted gross income for
2016 was $151,176, which included $106,651 in salary but also $44,000 in taxable income
due to an early disbursement of retirement funds that he indicates went to house repairs
and a minivan. (Tr. 84.) He underpaid his federal income taxes by $6,662 for 2016. As of
June 2, 2019, he owed the IRS $9,748 for tax year 2016 due to penalties and interest. (AE
A.) At his hearing, he explained his belated tax filings as follows:
And that really was the height of everything just coming together financially,
you know, between car and appliances. And trying to fix the house up and
trying to make a decision on my own as to whether or not the best thing to do
was to keep the house and try to keep the children. And it was just a lot for
one person to be able to handle at that time. And you know, I think that, that
just was something that slipped. It wasn’t a priority at that time. And I realized
it. Anyways, I’ve tried to make amends for that. (Tr. 59.)
Applicant testified, without any corroborating documentation, that he had filed his
income tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018. (Tr. 62.)
In June 2019, Applicant became employed by another defense contractor when his
previous employer lost the contract with the Air Force. On January 27, 2020, Applicant was
laid off for lack of work. (AE K, Tr. 36-37.) He collected unemployment compensation of
$700 a week in February 2020. (Tr. 63-64.) On March 2, 2020, he started a new job with a
defense contractor as an information technology manager for a limited access area at an
annual salary  of  $130,000.  (Tr. 38-39,  54.)  He  is  required  to  maintain  a  DOD security
clearance and is working in an unclassified environment pending the adjudication of his
clearance eligibility. (Tr. 38-39.) The job is closer to his home pays more than his previous
job. (AE C.)
Applicant’s 19-year-old daughter was in college as of March 2020. She is no longer
his dependent for income tax purposes, although Applicant was helping her with college
expenses through his GI bill. (Tr. 41.) His ex-wife continues to pay child support for their
other two daughters, currently at a reduced $196 a week because of her financial situation.
(Tr. 43-44.) As of his March 3, 2020 hearing, Applicant had approximately $1,400 in his
checking account and $2,300 in his savings account. (Tr. 49.) He has three open credit-
card accounts on which he owes an aggregate balance of approximately $1,000. (Tr. 65-
66.)
Sexual Behavior
Applicant  was  arrested on September 10, 2016, on three counts: misdemeanor
indecent assault and battery on a person age 14 or over; felony enticement of a child; and
felony lewdness, open and gross. A female teen friend of one of Applicant’s daughters
reported to the police that she had gone to Applicant’s residence to help clean. Applicant
was home alone and directed her to his bedroom to fold some laundry. He told her that he
was going to shower in an adjoining bathroom. He came to the bedroom fully clothed a
short time later and asked her if she was interested in having sex with him, and despite her
negative  response,  he  continued  to  compliment  her  before  exposing  himself  and
masturbating in front of her. After he told her that the incident would stay between them,
she ran home. Although reportedly hysterical, she gave a similar account of the incident to
her sister, and their mother took them to the police station, where they filed a complaint.
The girl’s mother told the police that her daughter had no psychological issues and was not
on  any  psychiatric  medication.  When  the  police  questioned  Applicant  at  his  home,
Applicant stated nothing had happened at his home, and he denied that he had exposed
himself. He told the police that he and the girl were upstairs when she made a comment
about something “kinky,” looked at her phone, and then left. Applicant posted $3,500 bail
and was released. (GE 9.)
Court records indicate that Applicant was charged on September 12, 2016, with
felony  lewdness,  open  and  gross;  misdemeanor  accost/annoy  another  person;  and
misdemeanor indecent exposure. Applicant reported his arrest to security officials at work
in February 2017, when he applied for a special access program. When asked by the
facility  security  officer  why  he  had  not  self-reported  in  a  timely  fashion,  Applicant
responded that he was unaware he had to report being arrested. (GE 8.)
When  asked  about  the  charges  during  his  April 2018  OPM  interview,  Applicant
stated that he had been arrested for indecent exposure and possibly a second charge of
gross or lewd conduct. He told the OPM investigator that his daughter had a friend, then
age 16 (Tr. 68), over to their house in September 2016; that the girl walked by his bedroom
and reported seeing him drying off after a shower; and that since his door was barely ajar,
she must have opened the door. He asserted that the girl had a history of mental health
treatments and of making false accusations, and that the case against him was dismissed
on  April  10,  2018.  (GE  2.)  Available  court  records  corroborate  that  the  charges  were
dismissed with prejudice on April 10, 2018. (GE 10.)
Applicant  asserts  that  records  obtained  through  subpoena  during  his  criminal
proceedings reveal that the complainant had a history of psychological treatment, including
an admission to a mental health facility for an extended period, and that she had previously
made similar accusations against others, and so the court recommended that the case be
dismissed. (AE F; Tr. 68.)
When asked at his security clearance hearing to give his version of the events of
September 2016, Applicant responded that, at the request of his daughter, he agreed to
pay her friend for some painting, covering the pool, and yard work around his house; that
his daughter was called into work and not home when the girl came over; that he met the
girl at the front door and told her that she could return in the afternoon if she wished. He
then stated:
And  that  was  it.  I  mean  I  kind  of  looked  at  her  and  she  had  a  drink  or
something in her hand. And she just looked rather odd. So she mumbled
something under her breath and you know, she left. (Tr. 67-69.)
When confronted by his April 2018 discrepant account to the OPM investigator that
the girl must have seen him drying off after his shower, Applicant responded:
That  could  have  happened  before  because  I  was  trying  to  recall  that my
daughter has a whole bunch of friends. And this is a girl that has come over
to our house a couple of times before. And I know that they were in our pool
and they were upstairs. And they were all, you know, changing and what
have you. And you know, I’m in my master bedroom, you know, and I could
have  —  this  is  what  I’m  recalling.  I  think  that  something  that  may  have
happened a few days earlier where I was in my shower and she was upstairs
in my daughter’s room. And I think she may have seen me through my door
being, you know, ajar. . . And I believe that, that’s the story that she went
home and told her older sister. And you know, it was just absolutely shocking
to me because I didn’t — the police didn’t come over to my house for almost
five or six hours later. So I was absolutely stunned as to, you know, [that]
they were making accusations [against] me. (Tr. 69-70.)
Applicant persisted in denying that the teenager was upstairs with him on the day in
question. (Tr. 72-73.) When confronted with the police report, where he had reportedly told
the police that he and the girl were upstairs when she made a comment about something
“kinky” before leaving, Applicant denied he had made the comment, and asserted that  the
girl was in his residence less than five minutes. (Tr. 72.) As to why he did not converse with
the girl outside given his daughter was not home, Applicant responded, “But I’ve had so
many girls — children in my house over the course of this many years . . . . So that was
very normal.” (Tr. 73.)
Applicant has strong ties to his community, where he has lived for 12 years. He is
active in his church, daughters’ school, and their basketball team. (AE C; Tr. 88.)
Character References
Five  individuals authored character references for Applicant. They have worked
alongside  Applicant  in  the  military  or  as  defense  contract  employees  or  both  and
recommend him for a security clearance. They consider Applicant to be trustworthy and to
have high integrity. A captain in the Air Force expressed confidence that Applicant is very
trustworthy  and  can  be  trusted  to  maintain  confidentiality  and loyalty to our country. A
contractor employed as a project lead on an Air Force cyberspace defense weapon system
has known Applicant for four years. He indicates that Applicant is committed to his career,
his family, and the country, and that “[Applicant’s] dedication to raising his children with the
same values and respect which he demonstrates on the job is something to be admired.”
(AE B.) None of these co-workers mentioned any of the security concerns at issue, so it is
unclear whether they know of Applicant’s financial problems or his arrest.
