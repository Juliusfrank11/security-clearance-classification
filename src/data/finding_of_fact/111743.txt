Applicant  is  a  29-year-old  mechanical  technician  for  a  defense  contractor,
employed since September 2017. He graduated from high school in 2008 and completed
some college credits. He served on active duty in the United States Air Force from 2008
until he was honorably discharged in 2014. Applicant was married in 2011 and divorced
in 2015. He has no children. He also reported being fired from jobs in February 2017 and
July 2017. He remained unemployed until September 2017.
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  owes  approximately  $22,581  in  delinquent  debts.
Applicant admitted all but two allegations, and stated in his Answer to the SOR that he
was working with a credit repair company on the unresolved debts, and the two debts he
denied  were  resolved  and  removed  from  his  credit  bureau  report  (CBR).  Applicant
testified that his debts arose between 2015 and 2017 after he moved to another state to
take a job with a car dealer. He ended up in debt after a year because he did not earn
enough to live, and was nearly homeless. He moved from job to job and accumulated
additional debts.  In  about  November 2018,  he  hired  a  credit  repair  company  and  paid
about $2,000 for their service. He stopped using the company in about December 2019.
SOR  ¶  1.a  is  a  delinquent  vehicle  lease  account  that  has  been  charged  off  for
approximately $16,659 after the vehicle was voluntarily repossessed. Applicant stated the
account became delinquent in about July 2017, while he was unemployed. Appellant’s
credit  repair  company  contacted  the  lender  in  about  November  2019,  but  they  did  not
report a response. No other action has been taken on the debt, and it remains unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b is a telephone utility collection account for approximately $1,569. The
account  was  reported  in  Applicant’s  2018  CBR  as  delinquent  in  September  2018.  He
contacted the creditor in July 2019 and the lender offered to accept a payment of 70% of
the debt with the remainder due the following month. Applicant did not have the funds to
pay, and the debt remains unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c is a $609 collection account for a credit card company. Applicant stated
in his SCA that he made a critical mistake in judgment when he obtained the credit card.
He  testified  that  he  spoke  to  the  collection  agent  and  agreed  to  begin  payments  of
$134.96 the day after his  hearing in this case, but he had no written plan. In his post-
hearing submission, Applicant provided a receipt for a pending payment of $470.
SOR ¶ 1.d is a $315 collection for an electric utility account reported delinquent in
October 2018. Applicant’s 2018 CBR shows the account was disputed. Applicant testified
that he has not contacted the creditor, but the account may have been paid. He did not
submit evidence of payment on the account or a reason for disputing it. The collection
account remains on his 2019 CBR and the account remains unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.e is a $778 collection account for a veterinary center. Applicant testified
that  the  account  was  deleted  from  his  CBR because  of  a  clerical error.  However,  in  a
post-hearing  submission,  he  showed  that  he  actually  paid  the  account  in  January  16,
2020, the day of his hearing. The account is now resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.f  is  a  $1,471  collection  account  for  a  telephone  utility,  that  Applicant
claims belonged to his former spouse. Applicant testified that he disputed the account,
and it was deleted from his CBR. The account is no longer reported on his CBR.
SOR ¶ 1.g is a $841 medical account from 2016. Applicant claimed that after a car
accident, his insurance company should have paid the debt. He testified that it is under
review,  but  provided  no  documentary  evidence  of  a  dispute  or  inquiry  filed  with  the
insurance company or medical provider. This account remains unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.h is a $338 credit union debt that is reported as a charged-off debt on his
2019  CBR.  Applicant  stated  the  credit  union  debt  resulted  from  a  bad  check  from  his
employer. Applicant testified that he paid the account and it should have been removed
from his CBR. Of note, Applicant’s CBR shows two accounts from the same credit union;
one of which was for an overdrawn account that was paid in 2015. The SOR account was
reported as a major delinquency (also an overdrawn account) in February 2019. Applicant
did not provide documentary evidence of resolution of the SOR account, and it remains
unresolved.
Applicant  paid  other  debts  not  included  in  the  SOR,  and  several  collection
accounts were removed from his CBR as a result of work by the credit repair company.
He testified that he has about $1,600 in savings, $1,000 in a retirement account, and a
net  monthly  remainder  of  $500  to  $600  per month  after  paying  his  monthly  debts  and
expenses.  He  testified  that  he  has  never  received  professional  financial  counseling
except for help repairing his credit, but he has a budget and recently purchased a home.
