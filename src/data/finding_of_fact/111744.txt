Applicant,  age  60,  is  married  with  one  adult  stepson.  He  graduated  from  high
school in 1976. He served honorably in the U.S. Navy from 1980 through 2000. He has
been  employed  as  a  flight  electrician  by  the  same  defense  contractor  since  2004.  He
was granted a DOD security clearance in 2008. (Item 4; Item 5 at 2)
The  SOR  alleged  two  delinquent  student-loan  accounts  totaling  $82,850.  In  his
SOR  response,  Applicant  denied  the  allegations  on  the  basis  that  both  accounts  had
been paid in full. The SOR allegations were corroborated by Applicantâ€™s May 2018 and
April 2019 credit reports. The record did not contain any information about  how or why
the accounts went into default. (Items 1, 2)
Applicant  cosigned  the  two  alleged  accounts  for  his  stepson  to  attend  college
with  the  intent  that  his  son  would  be  solely  responsible  for  repayment.  They  were
private  loans  totaling  $49,800.  One  account  number  ending  in  1037  was  opened  in
2005  and  the  other  ending  in  1052  was  opened  in  2007.  He  was  interviewed  in
November  2018  by  a  DOD  authorized  investigator  conducting  the  background
investigation  for  his  security  clearance  application.  He  provided  documents  to  the
investigator showing that the two alleged accounts had been paid in full in 2017.  (Item
5 at 3, 6, 7; Item 6 at 12; Item 7 at 2)
In his SOR response, Applicant stated that, sometime after the SOR was issued,
his son mailed paperwork directly to the DOD CAF to confirm the full payment of the two
alleged accounts. However, the DOD CAF never received that paperwork and it was not
otherwise  included  in  the  record.  In  the  FORM,  the  Government  argued  that  Applicant
had not met his burden to prove that the two alleged accounts had been paid in light of
the  2018  and  2019  credit  report  entries  and  missing  paperwork  alleged  to  have  been
sent to the DOD CAF by his son. (FORM; Items 2, 3)
Applicant  considers his  financial  situation  to  be  stable.  He  is willing  and  able  to
pay his expenses. Besides the alleged student-loan accounts, Applicant otherwise lives
within his means and manages his finances responsibly. (5 at 2; Items 6, 7)
