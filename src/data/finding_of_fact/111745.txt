Applicant  is  a  52-year-old  self-employed  subcontractor  of  a  defense  contractor.
He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has held intermittently for more than
30  years.  He  is  a  high  school graduate,  and  he  completed  a four-year apprenticeship.
He has never married, and he has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 27, 36, 42; GE 1)
Applicant  did  not  pay  all  his  federal  income  taxes  when  they  were  due  for  tax
years 2011 and 2013. The IRS transferred $80 from his 2016 credits and $2,037 from
his 2018 credits to pay his 2011 taxes. The IRS transferred $716 from his 2016 credits
and $954 from his 2018 credits to pay his 2013 taxes. (GE 2)
Applicant made a large withdrawal from a 401(k) retirement plan in 2014, which
he  used  in  an  unsuccessful  attempt  to  be  a  “day  trader.”  He  filed  his  2014  federal
income  tax  return  on  time,  but  he  did  not  understand  the  consequences  of  his  401(k)
withdrawal, and he did not report it as income. The 2014 IRS tax transcript reported that
$3,083  and  $20,568  were  “W-2  or  1099  withholding.”  It  is  likely  that  $3,083  was  the
normal  withholding  from  his  paycheck  and  $20,568  was  withheld  from  the  401(k)
disbursement.  He  paid  an  additional  $1,576  with  his  return.  The  IRS  assessed
additional  taxes,  penalties,  and  interest  in  April  2017.  (Tr.  at  15-18,  28-35;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE A)
The  IRS  transferred  $2,023  from  his  2015  credits  for  his  2014  taxes.  In  June
2019,  the  balance  in  taxes,  penalties,  and  interest  was  $24,017.  Applicant  made  five
monthly $350 payments between August 2019 and December 2019, leaving a balance
of $22,784. He paid $22,500 to the IRS on January 14, 2020, to pay all or almost all of
what was owed for 2014. (Tr. at 22-24; GE 2; AE A, B, D-F)
Applicant did not file his federal and state income tax returns when they were due
for  tax  years  2015  through  2017.  He  stated  that  he  was  traveling  extensively  for  work
and that he was too busy. He reported his failure to file tax returns for 2016 and 2017 on
a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that he submitted in July 2018.
He wrote that he failed to file the returns because he was “out of town.” He also wrote:
“As  for  the  Federal  Tax,  at  this  time,  nothing  has  been  done.  I  feel  that  I  am  due  a
refund for this tax year so it should not create a problem by filing late.” He also reported
that  he  owed  “$20,000  (Estimated)”  for  tax  year  2014,  and  that  “[a]ny  following  tax
refund  has  automatically  been  applied  to  this  debt.”  (Tr.  at  15,  21,  36;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE A)
Applicant was interviewed for his background investigation in  October 2018. He
discussed his unfiled tax returns and his unpaid taxes. He stated that he planned to file
the returns in 2019 when he files his 2018 returns. He stated that he talked to an IRS
representative about the taxes owed for 2014, and was told the taxes were considered
uncollectable by the IRS. This is consistent with the IRS transcript for 2014 that reported
on July 3, 2017: “Balance due account currently uncollectable.” The tax transcript shows
that the account changed to “collectable” on August 15, 2019, shortly before it received
Applicant’s first $350 payment. (Tr. at 40-41; GE 2, 3; AE A)
Applicant hired an accountant and filed his state and federal income tax returns
for tax  years 2015 through  2018  in April 2019.  He  would  have  been due  refunds  from
the IRS for each year, but the IRS transferred what would have been his refunds to his
back  taxes.  His  does  not  owe  any  state  taxes.  His  state  issued  refunds  for  tax  years
2016 and 2017. (Tr. at 22, 36-37, 41, 45; GE 2-3; AE A)
Applicant lost most of the money that he invested as a day trader. He  realizes it
was a mistake, and he does not intend to pursue it again. He now has an accountant to
handle  his  taxes  and  prepare  his  returns.  He  paid  $6,500  in  estimated  federal  tax
payments in 2019 for tax  year 2019. He paid $3,250 in estimated tax payments to his
state in 2019 for tax year 2019. He credibly stated that he has learned a valuable lesson
from this experience and there will no recurrence of his tax problems. (Tr. at 16, 22, 29-
33, 37-38, 50; AE B-D)
