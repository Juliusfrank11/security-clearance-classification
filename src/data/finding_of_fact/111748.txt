Applicant is a 46-year-old site manager employed by a defense contractor since
January  2014.  She  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  January  1992  to
September  1994  and  received  an  honorable  discharge.  She  has  worked  for  defense
contractors  since  March  2004.  She  received  eligibility  for  a  public  trust  position  in
November 2010.
Applicant married  in August  1994  and  has  two  daughters,  ages 19  and  23.  Her
older daughter is in college and lives away from home, and her younger daughter lives
with her. (Tr. 31.)
Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in May 1996, and she is currently enrolled
in  graduate  school,  working  toward  a  master’s  degree  in  information  systems
management. (Tr. 32.) She also completed training as a massage therapist in 2011 and
incurred significant student loans for her training, but she has never earned any income
as  a  massage  therapist.  (Tr.  33,  45.)  Credit  reports  from  September  2018  and  June
2019  reflected  six  delinquent  student  loans  totaling  $21,247.  Three  of  the  past-due
loans totaling $8,747 were reflected as paid collections, having been paid in December
2016. The remaining student loans were reflected as assigned to the government. (GX
2 at 3-4; GX 3 at 5-6.) She increased her income tax liability by filing separately so that
her husband’s tax refunds would not be seized to pay her delinquent student loans. (Tr.
61-62.) In 2014, she received a pay raise from $75,000 per year to $95,000, but she did
not increase the amount of tax withholding until 2015. The combination of her pay raise
and the decision to file separately increased the amount of taxes due. She testified that
did  not  timely  file  her federal  and  state  income  tax  return  for 2014  because  she  knew
she owed income taxes for that year. (Tr. 36-38.)
When  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in  September  2018,
she  told  the  investigator  that  she  did  not  file  her  returns  for  2014,  2015,  and  2016
because  she  could  not  afford to  pay  the  taxes  due.  She  also told the  investigator that
she  thought  she  had  a  three-year  grace  period  to  file  her  returns.  (GX  4  at  1.)  In  her
response  to  the  SOR,  she  stated  that  she  was  advised  about  the  three-year  grace
period by a “tax professional.” At the hearing, she did not repeat her claim of relying on
a  three-year  grace  period. When  asked  who  told  her about  a  three-year  grace  period,
she responded that she did not remember who it was. (Tr. 62.)
Applicant  did  not  rely  on  a  three-year  grace  period.  She  had  not  filed  the  past-
due returns when she answered the SOR in June 2019. She filed her 2014 federal and
state income tax returns in August 2019, after she received the SOR, and she filed her
2015  returns  in  September  2019.  As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  she  had  not  filed  her
returns for 2016 and 2017. (Tr. 40, 42-43; AX B with note attached.) She testified that
she  did  not  have  a  reason  for  not  having  filed  her  2016  returns,  except  that  she  was
“preparing  them  [herself]  and  just  fine-tuning  –  you  know,  refining  it  and  making  sure
that everything was correct.” (Tr. 41.) She offered the same explanation for not filing her
2017  returns.  (Tr.  43.)  She  timely  filed  her  federal  income  tax  return  for  2018  and
received a refund. (Tr. 44.)
After  Applicant  filed  her  federal  returns  for  2014  and  2015,  she  received  a  bill
from the IRS. She made an installment agreement with the IRS to pay the taxes due for
2014  and  2015,  totaling  about  $20,610.  The  agreement  provides  for  monthly  $292
payments. She made the first monthly payment on December 13, 2019. (AX E at 2; Tr.
27-28.)
Applicant’s  current  annual  salary  is  about  $101,000.  Her  husband  is  a  police
officer  and  earns  about  $64,000  per  year.  (Tr.  48.)  She  has  worked  for  her  current
employer  for  about  15  years.  She  provided  no  evidence  of  the  quality  of  her
performance, but  her substantial pay  raise  in  2014  indicates high-quality  performance.
Her  February  2020  credit  report  reflects  that  she  has  resolved  the  delinquent  student
loans that made her unable to pay her taxes. (AX I.)
