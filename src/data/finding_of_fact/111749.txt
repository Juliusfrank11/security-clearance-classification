Applicant denied the remaining eleven debts alleged in the SOR. He asserted none
of  the  debts  were  his,  but  were  the  result  of  his former  wife’s forging  his  signature  on
credit card applications and student loans documents for his stepdaughter.
Applicant is 49 years old. He was married to his first wife from 2001 to 2015. During
that time, he adopted her two daughters who were in their teens. He married his second
wife three months ago. (Tr. 25-27, 40) He attended college, but did not earn a degree. He
used student loans for his education and paid them. (Tr. 30)
Applicant  has  been  working  for  a  federal  contractor  since  April  2017.  For  three
years prior to obtaining his position, he worked as a truck driver. He worked for a federal
contractor from 2005 to 2010, during which time he deployed overseas for periods of time.
He also worked for federal contractors from October 2013 to May 2014. He has held a
security clearance while employed by federal contractors. (Tr. 28; GE 1)
In February 2015, while separated from his first wife, Applicant emailed her about
delinquent  debts  on  his  credit  report  that  he  asserted  were  not  his  and  wanted  her  to
resolve.  He  specifically  mentioned  16  credit  accounts  that  totaled $6,474, and  student
loans that totaled $70,438. In response, she asked him to give her a list of the credit card
debts that he believed to be her responsibility. She stated that the only student loans in
his name were related to one daughter’s  Parent Plus Loans, which she said would be
paid by their daughter. (AE C) Applicant said he subsequently discussed the debts with
his former wife, but never provided a written response to her with the account names and
numbers. (Tr. 69) Their marital settlement agreement did not address the distribution of
their debts. (Tr. 77)
In March 2015, Applicant and his first wife were divorced. In September 2015, he
filed a police report, over the telephone, alleging that his former wife had opened credit
cards in his name that he had not authorized. He told the police that some credit cards
had been in default since 2007. He could not supply the account numbers of the cards
because he did not have them. He did not mention the outstanding student loans alleged
in this case. (Tr. 45, 52-53; Answer)
Applicant stated that prior to contacting the police in September 2015, he sent 10
to  12  handwritten  letters  to  various  creditors,  including  the  Department  of  Education
(DOE), inquiring about the delinquent accounts and loans, and claiming that he was not
responsible for the debts. He said every creditor replied to his inquiry and asserted that
he was responsible for the debts. (Tr. 55-56)
In  his  2018  SF  86,  Applicant  disclosed  delinquent  debts  that  were  listed  in  his
name,  and  again  asserted  they  were  accounts  opened  by  his  former  wife  without  his
consent  or  authorization.  He  noted  that  he  requested  copies  of  the  signature  page
opening the accounts from the creditors, but never received them. He indicated that he
never signed for any purchase on the accounts. He said he filed a report with the local
police department but never received updates on his report. He also stated that he called
various law enforcement agencies, but did not receive assistance in resolving this issue.
(GE 1)
Based  on  credit  bureau  reports  (CBR),  dated  November  2019,  April  2019,  and
August  2018,  the  June  7,  2019  SOR  alleged  11  debts.  Five  of  them  were  delinquent
student  loans  that  totaled  $89,655.  They  were  opened  between  2011  and  2013  and
became delinquent between 2015 and 2018. Six debts were retail or consumer accounts
and totaled $6,220. They were opened between 2009 and 2011 and became delinquent
between 2014 and 2018. (GE 2, 3, 5)
According to GE 4, in July 2011 Applicant executed a promissory note as a parent
and  agreed  to  be  financially  responsible  for  his  daughter’s  student  loans.  GE  4  lists
Applicant’s  typewritten  name  as  a  guarantor,  but  the  exhibit  does  not  contain  the
signature page to the promissory note, which Applicant asserted his former wife forged.
Applicant denied that he signed that agreement and stated that he would not have done
so because he had a strained relationship with his daughter. The last time he spoke to
her was when he separated from his former spouse in 2014. Although Applicant disputed
the student loans with the DOE, it informed him that he was financially responsible. For
the  past  two  years,  DOE  has  intercepted  his  Federal  tax  refunds,  which  have  totaled
between  $3,000  and  $4,000.  He  assumed  that  DOE  will  continue  to  do  that  until  the
student loan debt is paid. (Tr. 64-67)
After receiving the SOR in June 2019, Applicant contacted an attorney about the
forgery and delinquent debts. The attorney was unable to help him. (Tr. 59) In October
2019, he filed an amendment to his September 2015 police report, in which he included
the  name  of  the  student  loan  lender  and  the  account  number.  (Tr.  59-60;  AE  A)  In
November  2019,  he  filed  an  identity  theft  report  with  the  Federal  Trade  Commission
(FTC).  He  listed  two  fraudulent  accounts:  one  credit  card  account  for  $484,  and
educational  loans  for  $70,436.  He  stated  in  the  report  that  he  learned  of  the  fraud  in
September 2015. He said he did not know that he could file an identity theft claim on-line
with the FTC. (Tr. 62; AE B)
All of the allegations in the SOR remain unresolved, except one. In October 2019,
Applicant paid the $1,131 judgement alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g. (GE 5 at 1) He acknowledged
that he had an account with the jewelry store alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f, but claimed he paid
the $1,239 debt. He did not provide proof that it was resolved. The debt was charged-off
in October 2019. He continued to assert that his former wife is responsible for the unpaid
debts because she fraudulently opened the accounts without his consent. (Tr. 73-74; GE
5)
Applicant  stated  that  his former wife  handled  their finances  while  he  was  away,
sometimes six months out of a year. (Tr. 43) Applicant earns about $85,000 annually. His
wife earns about $58,000 annually. (Tr. 33-34) He estimated that he has about $2,300
remaining each month after paying some expenses. (Tr. 38) He did not submit a written
budget or proof of credit or financial counseling.
