Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file her Federal
tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2018. Applicant admits this allegation. Applicant
disclosed her failure to timely file her tax returns on her e-QIP and discussed it during her
personal subject interview (PSI) and in her responses to DOHA’s interrogatories. (GX 3;
GX 4.) Her admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant, 62, is a financial analyst working for a defense contractor since 1987.
She  graduated  from  a  vocational  technical  college  in  1980.  She  married  and  divorced
twice and has three adult children. She was first granted a security clearance in 2006.
(GX 3.)
Applicant was diagnosed with a serious medical condition in 2010. As a result, she
was out of work on medical leave for eight months during which time she received short-
term  disability  payments  that  were  less  than  her  regular  pay.  She  incurred  significant
medical debt during this period and has suffered subsequent medical issues where she
incurred  additional  medical  debts.  She  attributes  her  financial  difficulties  to  her  health
issues, the related medical debts, and expensive monthly prescription costs. She stated
during  her  PSI  that  she  was  concerned that she  would  be unable to  afford  to pay  any
taxes she owed and did not timely file her Federal tax return for 2010. (GX 4.) On her e-
QIP, Applicant also listed the first year she failed to timely file as 2010. In her responses
to DOHA’s interrogatories, she stated that she is “uncertain” as to whether or not she filed
her returns for 2011, 2012, and 2013. After the first year of failing to timely file, the problem
“snowballed” and she did not timely file her Federal tax returns through tax year 2018.
(GX 2; GX 3; GX 4.) Applicant lives in a state where there is no state income tax.
On her August 2016 e-QIP, Applicant estimated that she owed $3,000 for 2012
and also for 2013, and $4,000 for 2014 and also for 2015. She stated that she “must take
immediate action and contact the IRS for a plan of action.” During her November 2018
PSI, she confirmed the amounts listed on her e-QIP and estimated that she owed $5,000
for 2016 and also for 2017. She stated that she knew she needed to contact the IRS but
was afraid to do so, stating that it could “take the rest of her life” to pay off her tax debts
and  described  her  overall  financial  situation  as  “stressed.”  However,  she  asserted  her
intention to contact the IRS to establish a repayment plan before the end of 2018.
In her July 20, 2019 responses to DOHA’s interrogatories, Applicant stated that
she filed her 2018 Federal tax return on July 19, 2019, and that she owed $4,640 for tax
year 2018. She further stated that she was sending an $800 payment towards the 2018
taxes owed. Additionally, she stated that she would make monthly payments to the IRS
to satisfy all her delinquent taxes, but had not yet contacted the IRS to make payment
arrangements.  Applicant  did  not  provide  any  documentation  supporting  her  assertions
that she filed her 2018 Federal tax return or that she paid $800 towards her 2018 tax debt.
SOR ¶ 1.a has not been resolved. There is no evidence that Applicant has participated in
any financial counseling.
