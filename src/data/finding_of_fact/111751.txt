Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c through 1.e, and 2.a.
He denied the allegations in the SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.f, and 1.g. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 61 years old. He was born in India and immigrated to the United States
in 1988. He married in India in 1989 and his wife immigrated the same year. He became
a naturalized citizen in 2000. His wife is also a naturalized citizen, but the year is unknown.
They have three children who were born in the United States and are ages 28, 27, and
19. They all live at home. Applicant has worked at his current job since May 2013. He is
seeking  employment  with  a  government  contractor  and  has  been  affiliated  with  them
since November 2017. (Tr. 21-22, 90-92; GE 1)
Applicant  testified  that  he  worked  for  different  employers  from  1989  until
approximately 2009 when he was laid off when the program he was responsible for was
shut down. He testified that from 2009 to 2013 he worked as an on-call contractor, and
his work was sporadic, and his income was significantly reduced. (Tr. 28, 57-58; GE 1)
Applicant explained that at the time he was laid off his wife was employed. They
were able to pay their bills for a period, but decided to prioritize their children’s college
education. He had a mortgage on his home with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.c. Applicant had
purchased the house in 2001 and consistently made payments and additional payments
toward the principal. Applicant testified that in 2009 or 2010, he obtained a home equity
loan from the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.a. The exact amount is unknown. (SOR ¶ 1.a-$157,805;
AE A) He used the home equity loan to stay afloat during his financial hardship and paid
his creditors, including credit cards, car loans, tuition, his son’s student loans, and other
expenses that were due. (Tr. 32-39, 58
Subsequent to his unemployment, Applicant began to fall behind on his mortgage
payments.  Applicant  told  the  government  investigator  during  his  December  2017
background investigation, that he attempted to refinance his mortgage, but after a period
he told the mortgagee to foreclose on the property because the process had not been
completed, and he planned to move to a new state for a job. He and his wife were both
offered  jobs  and  a  relocation  allowance.  Regarding  the  home  equity  loan,  he  told  the
investigator that he paid $300 a month on the loan until he lost his job. He said the creditor
told him to wait until the foreclosure was resolved before addressing this debt. He told the
investigator the home equity loan owed was resolved. He moved in March 2013. (Tr. 39-
43; GE 2)
Applicant provided a copy of the Judgment for Foreclosure and Sale (Judgment)
for his house filed in December 2014. It is unsigned. The total amount owed including all
related fees and interest  on the original mortgage  was $122,088. The Judgment notes
that if the proceeds of the sale are not sufficient to satisfy those sums due the Plaintiff,
the Court shall enter a deficiency judgment. Applicant testified that he does not know if
the  house  was  sold,  and  he  has  not  received  any  notice  of  a  deficiency  judgment.
Attached  to  the  Judgment  is  an  “Affidavit  of  Prove-Up.”  The  plaintiff  is  the  original
mortgage  company  and  the  defendants  include  Applicant,  his  wife,  and  the  creditor
Applicant received his line-of-credit loan from (SOR ¶ 1.a) among others. The affidavit
notes  that  the  line-of-credit  is  a  second  mortgage  on  Applicant’s  house  which  was
conveyed in 2007. The document further showed that the balance due and owed on that
mortgage through March 2014 with fees and court costs was $212,876. (Tr. 40-43; AE A)
Applicant did not provide evidence as to whether there was a deficiency balance
on  the  first  mortgage  (SOR  ¶  1.c)  and  the  current  status  or  resolution  of  the  second
mortgage as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.a is unresolved.
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($10,564) is a credit card debt. Applicant testified that his
credit  card  was  fraudulently  used,  and  he  was  a  victim  of  identity  theft.  He  stated  he
disputed  the  charges  with  the  creditor,  and  it  was  resolved  in  May  2016.  Applicant’s
November 2017 credit report shows the debt was charged off in March 2016. A judgment
was entered for the creditor of this account in July 2016. Applicant did not provide any
evidence of his dispute or that the debt was resolved. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 79-81;
GE 1, 2, 4, 8)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($19,558) is a credit card debt. Applicant stated the debt
belongs to his wife. His March 2017 credit report shows it belongs to him. He testified he
paid it for a period and then it was charged off. He did not provide any documents to show
he is not responsible for the debt or has taken action to resolve it. (Tr. 47-50, 81-83; GE
2, 4, 5)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($5,784) is for a personal loan that Applicant cosigned for
a friend. His friend made the required payments for a period and then stopped. Applicant
made small payments for a period and then stopped. Applicant testified that the debt was
charged off. He has not provided evidence that he has resolved the debt. (Tr. 47-51; GE
2, 4, 5).
Applicant testified that he was unaware of a tax lien entered against him from State
X, where he previously lived and owned a house. The tax lien was entered in December
2018. (SOR ¶ 1.f; $1,448) Applicant did not provide evidence of any attempt he may have
made to contact State A, pay, or resolve the tax lien. (Tr. 83-89; GE 6)
The Government provided evidence of a judgment and lien for Bank Group entered
against Applicant, his wife, and two other debtors in State X. It was filed in December
2011 in the amount of $450,633. (SOR ¶ 1.g) Applicant testified that he invested $150,000
in gas stations in 2008 or 2009. He said he was a board member of the corporation and
a silent partner and not liable. No evidence was provided by Applicant to show he has
resolved this judgment. (Tr. 62-76; GE 7)
Applicant was asked where he got the money to invest in gas stations. He stated
that  he  inherited  about  $450,000  from  his  father  in  about  2008  or  2009.  He  gave  his
brother $300,000  because  India  would  not  let  him  transfer  the  entire  amount  from  the
country. During his background interview, he told the investigator that his investment in
gas stations occurred in 1995 and the venture ended in 2003 or 2004. Applicant provided
confusing and contradictory testimony. (Tr. 62-78; GE 2)
Applicant testified that in 2013, he inherited $300,000. It is unknown if he received
a second inheritance from his mother. He made several trips to India to dispose of her
property  during  this period.  He  stated  that  he  brought  some  of  the  money  back  to  the
United States and gave some to his two daughters, paid off his car loans, and paid other
things. It is unknown whether the two amounts of $450,000 and $300,000 are the same
inheritance and there is a discrepancy in the amount or if they are two separate amounts
he inherited. (Tr. 62-78)
Applicant testified that he moved from State X in 2013. He purchased a house in
the new state where he was employed. The purchase price was $168,000, and he said it
was  “owner  financed.”  Having  recently  left  State  X  and  moved  to  a  new  state,  it  is
unknown where Applicant got the money to purchase a house in the new state. He sold
this house in 2015 and purchased another house for $355,000. He currently has about
$17,000  in  savings;  $35,000  in  a  401k  pension  plan;  and  $35,000  in  stock  market
investments. His wife has about $55,000 in her 401k pension plan and about $35,000 in
stock market investments. He and his wife both lease 2018 vehicles and have two other
cars  for  their  children.  Applicant  currently  earns  about  $80,000  annually,  and  his  wife
earns  about  $85,000  annually.  Applicant  pays  his  younger  son’s  tuition,  car  note,  and
living expenses. His other children have 2015 vehicles that were paid for by Applicant.
(Tr. 93-97)
Applicant’s parents are deceased. He has five brothers and four sisters. One sister
passed away. One sister lives in the United States. Three of his brothers are citizens of
the  United  States.  The  other  two  are  citizens  and  residents  of  India.  One  is  a  retired
chemist, and the other is a retired engineer. Both previously worked in private industry
before  retiring.  All  four  of  his  sisters  are  residents  and  citizens  of  India.  They  all  are
married  and  homemakers.  None  of  his  siblings  in  India  have  ties  to  the  government.
Applicant visits his relatives in India regularly. Applicant does not have any financial ties
to India. (Tr. 23-28, 54; GE 1, 3)
Applicant  disclosed  in  his  SCA  and  in  his  Counterintelligence  Focused  Security
Screening Questionnaire (CFSSQ) that from August 2010 through September 2014, he
traveled to the Philippines as a tourist or to visit family and friends  ten times. The trips
lasted from a few  days  to  a  month.  He financed  the  trip  himself and his family  did not
accompany him. From December 1989 to September 2016, he traveled to India to visit
family and friends 13 times. He financed the trips himself and he took his wife, daughter
and  two  sons  with  him  twice.  During  one  of  these  trips  he  and  his  family  also  visited
Thailand.  His  last  trip  to  India  was  in  January  2019.  Applicant  traveled  to  Thailand  in
August 2012 by himself as a tourist. He traveled to the United Arab Emirates as a tourist
in September 2016. Applicant testified that he travels to India once every three or four
years,  which  is  inconsistent  with  information  he  provided  in  his  CFSSQ  and  SCA.  He
testified that his friend in the Philippines finances his trips there, which is inconsistent with
his CFSSQ disclosures. (Tr. 55-62, 90; GE 1, 2, 3)
