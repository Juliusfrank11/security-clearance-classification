Applicant, age 62, is married and has three adult children. He served in the U.S.
Navy for 23 years, retiring in 2001. He obtained his undergraduate degree in 2009 and
received  his  master’s degree  in  the  same  year.  (Tr.  18)  Applicant  completed  his  most
recent security clearance application on July 3, 2016. He has held a security clearance
since  1978.  He  has  been  employed  as  a  contractor  for  about  20  years.  Applicant  has
been employed with his current employer since 2000 as a program manager. (GE 1)
The SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for past-
due income taxes for tax years 2009 through 2017 for a total amount of $195,720. (1.a-
1.h.)  Applicant admitted those SOR allegations but disputed the total amounts due. . The
SOR  further  alleges  that  Applicant  has  a  past-due  mortgage account in  the  amount  of
$10,951 and two collection student loan accounts. (1.i-1.k) Finally, allegation 1.l reflects
a judgment placed in 2017 in the amount of $7,733.
Applicant acknowledged the Federal tax debt, but presented documentation that,
as of February 2020, the amount due is approximately $71,417.79. (AE B) He stated that
he is working with a tax attorney to establish a repayment plan. The tentative start date
of the plan is March 28, 2020. The terms are $1,440 a month for the first year, to increase
to $2,375 a month thereafter. (AE B)  Applicant contacted a tax relief company in 2006
and entered various installment plans, but never maintained them. He stated that in 2009
he was in a repayment plan, but he stopped making payments after his wife was laid off
from her job. (Tr. 23) In total, Applicant had made about six payments. In 2012, after the
Government  issued  tax  liens  against  him,  he  made  a  $1,200  payment.  He  made  no
payments in 2013, but he started another installment plan in February 2014. (Tr. 23) He
made  one  payment  in  2016  for $300  and  a  few  payments  in  2018. There  is  no  record
evidence of any other voluntary payments. His income and his wife’s income during these
taxable  years  averaged  about  $200,000  annually.  (Tr.  26)  Applicant’s  Navy  retirement
pay has been garnished since 2019 in the amount of $400 a paycheck. (Tr. 21)
Applicant  believes  his  tax  problems  started  in  about  2006  when  he  received  a
$19,000 tax refund the previous year. (Tr. 14) His wife was not working and he believed
that there was some issue concerning a mortgage company overcharging on interest. He
stated that after that, because he never had owed taxes, he did not file future returns. He
now  admits  that  he  used  poor  judgment.  (Tr.  35)  He  disclosed  his  tax  issues  on  his
security clearance application. Apparently he filed tax returns in 2010 and learned how
much he owed. He had also been advised that he should increase his withholdings and
decrease his exemptions, but he did not do that. (Tr. 27)
SOR allegation 1.i is a home mortgage account that is alleged to be past due in
the amount of $10,951. Applicant has a repayment plan with the bank. He presented a
document showing that his mortgage is $2,867 and is up to date as of February 2020.
(AE C) This issue began in 2018, when he noted that he “was struggling with things.” (Tr.
41) He made a lump sum payment and the loan was modified to a lower interest rate. (Tr.
43)
SOR allegations 1.j and 1.k are two Federal student loan accounts that have been
placed  for  collection,  for  $64,762  and  $16,933.  .  He  obtained  these  loans  when  he
attended undergraduate and graduate school in about 2007-2009. He stated that he fell
behind  due  to  his  wife’s loss  of  employment  on  at  least  four  occasions.  (GE  1)  In  his
security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that he was using his 401(k) money to
repay the student loans at $900 a month. (GE 1) Applicant stated at the hearing that the
last payment he made was in June 2015. He stopped paying because the loans were no
longer  deferred.  However,  he  has  been  employed  steadily  since  2000  making  a  good
salary. Applicant explained that he had financial difficulties due to the tax issues. He also
asserted that about $35,000 of the student loan debt was paid over the last two years, at
about $700 per pay period, through a wage garnishment. He provided no documentation
to support this claim beyond AE E, a statement showing that only interests had been paid
on the loans. (AE E; Tr. 39-40)
SOR  allegation  1.l  is  a  judgment  placed  in  2017  in  the  amount  of  $7,733.30.
Applicant  purchased  computer  equipment  in  2015.  At  first  money  for  payments  were
taken from his paycheck. He was vague about the details. He also noted that the creditor
might have sent him bills, but his address changed. He forgot about it, and then a lien
was placed. (Tr. 44) He believes the creditor garnished his pay and that the debt is almost
paid. He believes that he bought about $10,000 or $12,000 in equipment from the creditor
over the years. (Tr. 44)
Applicant has credit cards and some personal loans. He bought his wife a new car
in 2015. He also took a trip to the Caribbean in 2014. (Tr. 52) Applicant and his wife earn
an approximate annual income of over $200,000, though her income varies.  He has had
steady  income  for  the  years  since  2000,  sometimes  making  as  much  as  $239,000
annually.  He  knows  that  his  wife  was  unemployed  about  four  times,  but  she  is  now
employed  and  earns  about  $79,000  annually.  He  has  a  sizeable  net  remainder  each
month ($2,200). He did not submit a budget and made no mention of financial counseling.
He did not know the amount in either his checking account or his 401(k). (Tr. 51)
Applicant submitted as post-hearing documentation a power of attorney for the tax
relief company signed in 2018. He also sent copies of his 2015, 2016, and 2017 federal
income tax returns signed March 2019. (AE D)
