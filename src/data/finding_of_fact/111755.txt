bureau  report  from  August  2019,  there  are  three  new  unalleged  delinquent  debts.
Applicant fell behind on her financial obligations  due to working at jobs where she was
underemployed, and she was caring for her children as a single parent. Several of her
debts  are  delinquent  medical  bills.  Applicant’s  oldest  two  daughters  are  in  college;

In  approximately  2015,  a  former  co-worker  and  now  ex-friend  agreed  to  help
Applicant move furniture. She paid for the rental truck, and the rental agreement was in
her name. Applicant’s ex-friend asked a friend of his to help with the move, and they drove
the  rental truck  together. While  they  were  driving  the  truck,  they  rear-ended Applicant,
who was in her personal vehicle with her middle daughter. Immediately after the accident,
Applicant called the police, and they came to the scene of the accident. The driver of the
truck  was  given  two  tickets.  Additionally,  she  reported  the  accident  to  her  insurance
company and the rental company. Ultimately, she paid $500 out of her own pocket to pay
for  the  repairs  for  her  vehicle  and  received  no  money  from  her  insurance  company.
Applicant was arrested in October 2016, and charged with felony forgery and four counts
of felony insurance fraud related to the 2015 incident. She plead not guilty. In September
2017, the charges were dismissed, but other related charges were filed against her. In
2018,  the  case  was  continued,  and  since  then  she  has  not  heard  from  the  court.  The
hearing  record  was  left  open,  in  part,  to  allow  Applicant  to  submit  documentation  and
clarification as to the status of the pending charges. (Answer at 4-8; GE 1; GE 2 at 2; Tr.

of $147 in July 2019. She set up biweekly payments of $132 to be deducted from her

her accident was resolved. She testified that her insurance covered the majority of the
outstanding  balance;  however,  she  did  not  have  gap  insurance,  and  the  remaining
balance is $2,442. The collection agency contacted her approximately one month before
the  hearing,  and  she  set  up  a  settlement  agreement  to  make  automatic-biweekly
payments of $47 and pay a total of $1,000. The first payment was scheduled for the week
after the hearing; however, she provided no substantiating documentation at or after the

emergency room bills. SOR ¶¶ 1.k-1.m are included in the credit-counseling agreement,
but she provided no proof of payments other than a July 2019 payment of $147. In her
response to the SOR, she claimed that she was working to settle and resolve SOR ¶¶
1.h-1.j;  however,  she  failed  to  provide  proof  of  payment  or  settlement  agreements.
