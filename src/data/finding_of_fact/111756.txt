Applicant  prepared  his  own  tax  returns,  using  commercial  tax-preparation
software.  (Tr.  47.)  In  April  2009,  he  was  not  prepared  to  file  his  federal  income  tax
return for 2008, and he obtained an extension until October 15, 2009. On October 15,
2009, he had continued to procrastinate. He called the IRS, told the IRS representative
that  he  believed  he  was  entitled  to  a  refund  for  2008,  and  asked  about  the
repercussions  of  not
the
representative told him that there would be no penalty if he was entitled to a refund, but
that  his  refund  would  be  forfeited  if  he  did  not  file  his  return  within  three  years  of  the
original  due  date.  Up  to  this  time,  Applicant  had  always  received  refunds.  The  federal
filing  by  October  15,  2009.  Applicant
testified
that
refunds  ranged  for  $1,723  to  $4,038,  and  the  state  refunds  ranged  from  $99  to  $348.
(Tr. 21-22.)
After filing his 2008 return, Applicant adopted a three-year deadline for filing late
federal  and  state  returns.  (Tr. 23.) Each  tax  year, he  requested a six-month  extension
for  his  federal  return  and  then  filed  in  accordance  with  his  self-imposed  three-year
deadline.  (Tr.  46.)  He  never  requested  an  additional  extension  beyond  the  automatic
six-month extension. (Tr. 63.) He could not recall when he started requesting extensions
from  the  state.  (Tr.  64.)  He  did  not  consider  the  impact  of  late  filings  on  his  security
clearance until he was interviewed by a security investigator in July 2018. (Tr.  44.) He
admitted at the hearing that his attitude toward his obligations to timely file tax returns
was “lackadaisical.” (Tr. 16.)
Applicant knew that his tax liability increased as his children became adults and
he  could  no  longer  take  deductions  for  them.  In  an  effort  to  ensure  that  he  would  not
owe  federal  taxes,  he  prepaid  $1,000  with  each  extension  to  file  for  2014,  2015,  and
2016,  and  he  prepaid  $3,500  with  his  2017  request  for  an  extension  of  time  to  file.
However, his prepayments were insufficient to avoid a federal tax liability for 2016 and
2017.  (GX  2  at  8-12,  25.)  When  he  filed  his  state  income  tax  return  for  2013  in  May
2017, he sent a payment of $500 to offset any state taxes due for 2016, which resulted
in a refund for 2016. (Tr. 26.)  As of June 27, 2019, Applicant had  filed his federal and
state  tax  returns  and  paid  all  federal  and  state  income  taxes  due.  (Answer  to  SOR  at
25-28.)
Except for Applicant’s failures to timely file federal and state income tax returns
and  timely  pay  the  taxes  due,  he  has  no  other  history  of  financial  irresponsibility.  His
credit  record  reflects no  derogatory  information.  (AX  B.)  He earns about  $121,000  per
year.  His  wife  is  a  retired  educator,  receives  a  pension,  and  works  occasionally  as  a
substitute teacher. (Tr. 31.)
Applicant’s current supervisor, who has worked with him for 14 years, submitted
a letter attesting to Applicant’s honesty and trustworthiness and opining that he should
be  allowed  to  retain  his  security  clearance.  (AX  E.)  Applicant’s  department  security
representative,  who  has  worked  with  him  for  31  years,  attested  to  his  unquestionable
ethics,  integrity,  and  attention  to  detail.  He  believes  that  Applicant’s  neglect  of  his
obligation  to  timely  file  his  tax  returns  was  an  anomaly  and  should  not  preclude  him
from  holding  a  security  clearance.  (AX  C.)  A  former  peer  who  became  Applicant’s
department  manager  considers  Applicant  trustworthy,  reliable,  and  worthy  of  retaining
his security clearance. (AX D.)
