Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i, and denied ¶ 1.g stating
that the alleged account was paid in full. Additional findings of fact follow.
Background Information1
Applicant is  a  56-year-old  foreman  inspector  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since  July  1982.  He  seeks  to  retain  his  security  clearance,  which  is  a  requirement  to
maintain  his  current  employment.  His  SF-86  indicates  that  he  has  successfully  held  a
security  clearance  since  at  least  August  2002.  The  FORM  does  not  contain  any
information  about  his  educational  background.  Applicant  married  in  September  1987
and has two adult children.
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s nine SOR debts total $82,051 and are established in part by his SOR
Answer,  his  February  14,  2018  and  May  9,  2019  credit  reports,  and  his  September  6
and 11, 2018 Office of Personnel Management Personal Subject Interviews (OPM PSI).
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.i; Items 2, 4 - 6)
Department  Counsel’s  FORM  noted  that  it  is  not  clear  from  the  record  exactly
when or how Applicant’s financial problems began, apart from his statement in his SOR
Answer  that  his  delinquent  debts  “snowballed.”  (Item  4)  He  added  in  his  post-FORM
submission that he “got  [himself] in financial trouble.” To regain financial responsibility,
Applicant  retained  the  services  of  a  debt-relief  law  firm,  entering  into  a  contract  with
them  dated  July  29,  2017.  (Items  2,  6,  7)  The  debt-relief  law  firm  provided  him  with
financial  counseling  as  well  as  a  plan  to  place  all  of  his  debts  in  a  debt  negotiation
program. (Item 2, 6, 7)
Since September 2017, Applicant has been paying the debt relief law firm $1,100
a month by direct debit. His SOR Answer and post-FORM submission confirmed that he
has been making timely payments to the debt-relief law firm per their agreement. (Items
2,  7)  He  noted  in  his  SOR  Answer  that  his  largest  debt  of  $27,479  was  paid  in  full,
presumably  settled  for  a  lesser  amount.  (Item  2)  With  the  elimination  of  this  debt,  his
total SOR debt amount was reduced to $54,572. This revised amount does not provide
the current state of Applicant’s debt liability.
1 The limited background information regarding Applicant was derived from the FORM and was the most
current information available.
Applicant’s  contract  with  the  debt-relief  law  firm  estimates  that  he  will  be  debt-
free in 48 months. Applicant stated that he hopes by his documented corrective action it
will be evident that he is doing the right thing and will be out of debt in the near future.
