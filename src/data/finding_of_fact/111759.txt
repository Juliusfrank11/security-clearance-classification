Applicant  is  a  33-year-old  information  technology  (IT)  lead  for  a  defense
contractor  who  seeks  a  security  clearance.  The  SOR  allegations  that  are  admitted  by
Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant  has married for the first time in March 2020. (GE 1; Tr. 21) He has one
child  from  this  marriage.  He  earned  a  high  school  general  educational  development
(GED)  diploma  in   December  2008.  (GE   1)   He   attended  a  local  community   college
between August 2010  and December 2010 but did not earn a degree or diploma.  (GE  1)
Since March 2016 he has attended college classes on a part-time  basis  and  needs two
more credits to earn  a bachelor’s  degree in  computer information technology  and  cyber
security. (Tr. 19-20)  Applicant has never served in the military.
Since  November  2017,  Applicant  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  as  an  IT
lead.  (GE  1)  Between  September  2011  and  November  2017,  he  worked  for  various
employers in electronic technician positions. (GE 1)
Employment separation history
In  January  2012,  Applicant  was  terminated  from  his  FSR  lead  position  with
Company  A  after  engaging  in  a  verbal  confrontation  with  a  Marine  client  and
brandishing  a  knife  in  October  2011  (GE  1;  Tr.  19-20)  Before  being  sent  home  by  his
employer at the time, he was observed by several Marines to be arguing with a Marine
client  and  speaking  badly  to  him.  (GE  8)  After  the  Marine  client  pulled  a  gun  on
Applicant,  Applicant  brandished  a  knife  at  the  customer  in  an  effort  to  repel  the
perceived  threat.  (GE 2;  Tr.  52-53)  Responding  to  the  Marine  client’s  weapons  threat,
Applicant called his onsite company supervisor for help. (Tr. 47-48)
Marine  police  investigators  that  were  called  to  investigate  the  October  2011
altercation incident involving Applicant and the Marine client cited Applicant for assault
with a knife against an active duty Marine enlistee known to Applicant at the time of the
reported  assault.  (GE  8)  In  his  own  report  of  the  incident  to  investigating  Marine
investigators,  Applicant  claimed  that  his  Marine  client  customer  initiated  the  physical
exchange  with  him  and  detailed  how  the  Marine  client  entered  his  work  space  and
physically  confronted  him.  (GE  8)  Thereafter,  Applicant  and  the  Marine  enlistee
engaged in a brief but intense verbal altercation.
According to Applicant’s account in the JPAS incident report of the October 2011
incident,  shortly  after  the  Marine  client  confronted  Applicant  over  his  claimed
entitlement  to  the  computer  Applicant  was  entrusted  with,  the  Marine  client/customer
pulled  a  magazine  from  a  pouch  in  his  pants,  inserted it  into  the  magazine  well  of  his
hand  gun,  and  pointed  the  weapon  at  Applicant’s  head.  (GE  8;  Tr.  47)  After  briefly
vacating the room occupied by the Marine  client, Applicant returned to the doorway of
the  room  to  retrieve  his  laptop.  (Tr.  49-51)  Upon  Applicant’s  call  for  help  to  his  onsite
company supervisor, Marine investigators arrived at the scene and undertook their own
internal  investigation.  (GE  8;  Tr.  24-26)  At  the  outset  of  their  investigation,  they  told
Applicant to leave the room. (GE 8; Tr. 53-54) Before heeding the military investigators’
instruction to leave the room, Applicant continued to engage in a heated exchange with
the  Marine  client  that  included  physical  threats  of  bodily  harm  directed  at  each  other.
(GEs 4 and  8)
Applicant  attributed  his  aggressive  reactions  to  the  Marine  client  in  the  October
2011  incident  to  the  emotional  stresses  he  experienced  from  his  witnessing  insurgent
activity in Afghanistan. (Tr. 23-24, 54-58) He acknowledged, though, that he could have
left  the scene  earlier in  his ongoing confrontation with the Marine client and  reported the
client’s  actions  to  superior  authorities.  (Tr.  27)   What  is  especially  troubling  about
Applicant’s  account is his minimizing of the incident in  his assignment of reasons for  his
termination  in   the  electronic  questionnaires  for  investigations  processing  (e-QIP)   he
completed  in   December  2017.  (GE  1)  Asked  the  reasons  for   his  stated  firing  from
Company A in  2012, he admitted only to “fussing with  client/customer.” (GE  1) Whether
minimizing   to  promote  a  more  favorable   profile  of  himself  or  failing  to  appreciate  the
seriousness  of  his  actions  that  prompted  his  termination,  Applicant’s  responses  are
concerning and reflect  lapses in candor and judgment.
When asked for more information about the October 2011 altercation incident in
a  follow-up  OPM  interview  with  an  investigating  agent  in  September  2018,  Applicant
reported only that he was sent home by his Company A supervisor “due to arguing with
the  client”  over  their  respective  mission  roles  and  having  the  client  pull  a  gun  on  him.
(GE  2)  He  made  no  mention  in  the  interview  of  his  brandishing  a  knife  in  front  of  the
Marine client. (GE 2)
Applicant was terminated by a second employer (Company B) in March 2013 for
cited misconduct. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 55-56) Prior to  being terminated, Applicant’s  employer
cited Applicant in January 2013 for changing his itinerary without approval and failing to
be  honest  about  his  whereabouts  in  January  2013.  (GE  7;  Tr.28-33)  In  a  termination
memorandum  of  March  5,  2013,  his  supervisor  with  Company  B  characterized
Applicant’s  actions as a direct  violation of the company’s crew health and safety policy
and  actions,  enough  to  warrant  termination  of  his  services  upon  his  repatriation  to  his
home  of  record  in  the  United  States.  (GE  7)  Applicant  attributed  his  absence  from  his
assigned duty station to a misunderstanding over who he was required to notify of his
pending departure from his duty station. (Tr. 31-32, 58-60) Asked about the reasons for
his termination in his 2017 e-QIP, he could not remember why he was fired. (GE 1)
Records  confirm  that  in  November  2017  Applicant  was  terminated  by  another
employer  (Company  C).  (GEs  1-3)  This  time,  he  was  charged  by  his  Company  C
employer  with  abandoning  his  assigned  job  location  in  Afghanistan  on  November  5,
2017 without proper advance notice to his employer. (GEs 3-6; Tr. 33-40)
Applicant claimed that he left his post on November 5, 2017, to see his critically
ill  father  state  side  and  informed  his  onsite  supervisor  back  in  August  2017  of  his
intentions before making his unilateral decision in November 2017 to depart  for home.
(GE  2-4;  Tr.  33)  He  claimed,  too,  that  he  informed  his  Company  C  human  resources
(HR)  manager  of  his  intentions  before  departing  and  was  told  only  to  let  his  onsite
supervisor know. (Tr. 34)
Once  Applicant  reached  his  state  side  destination,  Applicant  claimed  he  called
his  onsite  supervisor  in  Afghanistan  and  told  him  “he  could  not  do  my  time  sheet”
because  of  restrictions  in  his  employees  handbook  that  precluded  him  from  charging
earned  leave  time  while  in  Afghanistan.
(GE  6;  Tr.  34)  He  claimed  to  have  further
advised his onsite supervisor in Afghanistan that he needed to talk to his HR manager
because  “he  was  not  going  to  come  back”  to   his  Company  C  employer  and  would  be
taking a new job state side, effective November 20, 2017. (GEs 3-6; Tr. 35, 63-65)
Applicant’s  Company  C  employer  considered  his  attempt  to  resign,  effective
November  18,  2017,  to  be  ineffective.  His  Company  C  employer  found  that  Applicant
falsified his time sheet for the period of November 5-17, 2017, and effectively resigned
his  position  on  November  5,  2017.  (GEs  3-6;  Tr.  63-65)  Company  C’s  findings  are
corroborated  in  the  DoD’s  JPAS  report.  Applicant’s  Company  C  employer  cited
evidentiary support from Applicant’s onsite supervisor that Applicant had abandoned his
position in Afghanistan on November 5, 2017, and not November 17, 2017, as Applicant
claimed in his emailed resignation. (GEs 5-6)
While  Applicant may have told his  onsite supervisor in  August 2017  that he might
be leaving his work site due  to  his father’s  illness, he never purchased  his airline tickets
for  his trip  to  the United States until the date of his departure, November 5,  2017. (GEs
4 and  6; Tr.  65-66, 68-70, and  78-79)  Despite his departure for home on November 5,
2017,  he  continued  to   submit  inventory  reports  and   timesheets  through  November  17,
2017, claiming that he was working at his work site. (GEs 3-6)
In an email of November 18, 2017 to his onsite supervisor, Applicant confirmed
his leaving his work site “to head home due to his father’s passing.” (GE 6) In this same
email, he told his onsite supervisor he was making arrangements for getting his mother
situated and starting a new job state side on November 20, 2017. (GE 6)
When  Applicant  spoke  to  his  HR   manager   on  November  20,  2017,  he  told  her
that if  he had “put the 5th  for my last day I wouldn’t got my PTO  (personal  time off) in  30
days  in   advance.”  (GE  6)   Denying  any  falsification  of  his  time  sheet,  he   defended  his
charging  time  worked  for   the   November  5-17  timeframe,   claiming  these  hours
represented  earned  and   entitled   PTO  hours.   (GEs   4-6)  Email   records  document  that
neither  Applicant’s  onsite  supervisor  nor   his  HR   manager  accepted  Applicant’s
explanations and  found him to have abandoned his worksite without proper notices and
approvals. (GEs 4-6)
Email exchanges between Applicant and his Company C employer fully support
his  employer’s  version  of  the  timing  of  Applicant’s  abandonment  of  his  work  site  on
November  5,  2017  without  proper  notices  or  approvals  (leaving  behind  keys  in  an
unlocked  vehicle  and  an  office  room  in  disarray).  (GE  6)  Once  he  was  state  side,  he
emailed his resignation, bearing a date of November 18, 2017. (GE 6)
Applicant’s  claimed  misunderstandings  as  to  who  he  needed  to  notify  before
departing  for  the  United  States  to  see  his  ill  father  are  not  corroborated  by  any  of  the
information  included  in  Applicant’s  December  2017  e-QIP,  in  his  September  2019
interview with an OPM investigator, in Company C’s November 2017 termination letter,
or by any furnished documentary evidence.
Based on a consideration of all of the compiled evidence in the record, Company
C’s findings provide the most accurate account of Applicant’s actions while employed by
Company C. Company C’s overall findings are well supported  and are accepted.
Looking  back   in   hindsight   Applicant  believes  he  should  have   contacted  his  HR
office   and   asked  for   leave  paperwork,  and  he  expressed  his  regrets   for  not  doing  so.
(Tr. 42) Because he never went through the proper channels to obtain leave, Applicant’s
Company C employer  never accepted his November 18, 2017,  emailed resignation and
treated his exit from  his work site on November 5,  2017 as a site  abandonment.  (GEs  3-
6; Tr. 71-72)
Applicant’s finances
Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  income  tax  return  for  the  tax  year  of
2016. (GE 9) An IRS account transcript confirmed that Applicant  filed his 2016 federal
tax  return  in  July  2019  and  received  a  tax  refund  of  $5,600  in  September  2019  with
added interest of $48.49. (GE 2 and AE A; Tr. 23-34)
Applicant attributed his late filing with help of his wife to his military deployment
and reliance on his retained tax accountant to prepare and submit his 2016 return. (GE
2;  Tr.  22-23)  He  later  learned  that  his  accountant  became  ill  and  was  unavailable  to
Applicant to communicate with about the status of his 2016 tax return. (GE 2; Tr. 22-23)
Both  in  his  OPM  interview  and  in  his  hearing  testimony,  Applicant  affirmed  that
his  retained  tax  accountant  never  obtained  a  federal  filing  extension  for  Applicant  and
never filed a 2016 federal tax return on Applicant’s behalf. (Tr. 22-23) Applicant assured
that he first learned that his 2016 federal tax return was never filed before he completed
his security clearance application. Applicant’s explanations for not filing his 2016 federal
tax return in a timely way are both plausible and credible, and are accepted. (GE 9; Tr.
23)
Character references
Applicant  is  well-regarded  by  his  current  supervisors,  colleagues  (both  present
and past), friends, and former clients of his who have worked closely with him and find
him  reliable  and  trustworthy.  (AEs  C  and  H-I)  Applicant  has  received  excellent
performance  evaluations  from  his  current  employer  recognizing  his  contributions  as  a
network  engineer.  (AEs  E  and  H;  Tr.  17)  Applicant  is  active  in  his  community  as  a
neighborhood  trainer  and  works  with  Little  League  organizers  in  providing  training
assistance. (Tr. 43)
