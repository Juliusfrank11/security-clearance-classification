In his two responses to the SOR, Applicant denied, with brief comments, all of the
SOR  allegations  pertaining  to  financial  considerations  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  through  1.f.).
Applicant’s comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of
the evidence  in  the  record, and  upon  due  consideration  of  same, I  make  the following
findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a field and service mechanic with his current employer since March 2018. He served
as  an  aircraft  mechanic  for  another  company  from  April  2017  until  March  2018.  He
previously served in an enlisted status with the U.S. Air Force on active duty from May
2008 until May 2014, when he was honorably discharged. Other than some commentary
regarding student loans, he reported no specific information regarding his education. He
was  apparently  granted  a  secret  clearance,  but  while  he  does  not  recall  the  date,
Department Counsel reports the date was 2008. He was married in 2008, and he was
divorced in 2017. He has no children.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can  be  found  in  the  following  exhibits:  Item  7  (Combined  Experian,  TransUnion,  and
Equifax Credit Report, dated May 31, 2018); Item 8 (Equifax Credit Report, dated April
15,  2019);  Item  6  (Enhanced Subject Interview,  dated  November 1, 2018); and  Item 4
(Applicant’s Answers to SOR, dated August 17, 2019).
Applicant reported that he was unemployed on three occasions: from March 2008
until he entered the U.S. Air Force in May 2008; from May 2014, upon his discharge, until
November  2014;  and  from  November  2016,  upon  returning  to  the  United  States  from
employment overseas, until April 2017. (Item 5 – SF 86, dated April 9, 2018, at 16-18) He
attributed his financial problems to  a variety of factors: his estimated combined total of
one year of unemployment; his separation and divorce; and his ex-wife’s financial issues
that he felt obligated to try to help her with while forgoing his own financial issues. (Item
5, at 45) He failed to specify the negative impact his separation and divorce had on his
finances, or what the specific issues were regarding her finances, and what bills he paid
for her.
In April 2018, Applicant contended that he had been in the process of rebuilding
his credit for the past year, and that he had already paid down credit cards and “taken
care of things in collections.” (Item 5, at 45) He claimed that almost all of his disposable
income is used to pay down his debts whenever he can do so. He also stated that he had
contacted  the  company  with  his  previous  student  loans,  and  that  he  was  paying  that
company $100 per month, with the intention of increasing his payments once he obtains
a new position. (Item 5, at 45)  Applicant failed to submit any documents to support his
contentions that he contacted any creditors; that the U.S. Department of Education had
placed  his  student  loans  in  deferment  or  forbearance;  or  that  he  had  been  making
payments to any creditors.
The  SOR  alleged  six  delinquent  student-loan  accounts  totaling  approximately
$71,955, as set forth as follows: SOR ¶ 1.a. is a student loan with an unpaid balance of
$23,026  that  was  charged  off  and  transferred  to  the  government,  and  because  it  was
charged off, Applicant contends that he is no longer responsible for it. (Item 7, at 11; Item
8, at 1; Item 6, at 7; Item 4, at 1); SOR ¶¶ 1.b. through 1.e. are student loans with unpaid
balances of $3,913; $3,721; $3,435; and $1,868 that were in default and assigned to the
government, but Applicant claims they were consolidated and are being paid while he is
in school. (Item 8, at 2; Item 6, at 5-8; Item 4, at 1-2); SOR ¶ 1.f. is a student loan with an
unpaid balance of $35,992 for which Applicant initially claimed to be paying the collection
agent $100 per month, but eventually he chose not to make the payments after he learned
how  creditor  procedures  work.  He  initially  stated  that  he  intended  to  wait  for  “debt
forgiveness” until the debt is written off, but if that does not occur by December 2019, he
intended to pay it off in full with one lump sum at that time. He subsequently changed his
position, claiming that the account was “falsely added and removed from collection credit
report.” (Item 7, at 11; Item 8, at 2; Item 5, at 45; Item 4, at 2; Item 6, at 5)
It is noted that despite Applicant’s claimed inability to maintain the six student-loan
accounts alleged in the SOR in a current status because of insufficient funds to do so, he
managed to take a variety of personal trips, outside of government travel, to  Morocco,
Spain,  and  Turkey  in  June  2016;  the  Netherlands  in  May  2017;  Greece  in  July  2017;
Ghana in September 2017; and the United Kingdom in December 2017. (Item 5, at 28-
37) Furthermore, while Applicant generally referred to insufficient funds as his explanation
for failing to maintain his student loans in a current status, it appears that he may have
had sufficient funds to make the one promised lump-sum payment of $35,992, but merely
chose not to do so.
It is not known what Applicant’s current financial resources may be because he did
not report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder
that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a
budget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of additional financial
information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position
financially than he had been.
