The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  F  that,  as  of  July  26,  2019,  Applicant  owes
charged-off credit-card debts of $22,580 (SOR ¶ 1.a), $11,737 (SOR ¶ 1.b), and $7,953
(SOR ¶ 1.d), and a collection debt of $8,096 (SOR ¶ 1.c). Under Guideline E, Applicant is
alleged  to  have  falsified  his  June  19,  2018  SCA  by  responding  negatively  to  inquiries
concerning whether, in the past seven years, he had any bills or debts turned over to a
collection agency, and any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for
failing to pay as agreed (SOR ¶ 2.a). (Item 1.)
When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted the debts and asserted they arose
to pay for expenses he incurred while he owned a liquor store business that failed. He
explained that he was then unemployed for about a year before taking minimum wage jobs.
Applicant  had  an  attorney  attempting  to  negotiate  settlements  for the  debts.  Applicant
responded “Admit” to the Guideline E allegation, but explained in an affidavit that he would
never willingly falsify and that he misunderstood the questions on the SCA. (Item 1.) After
considering Items 1 through 5, which includes Applicant’s response to the SOR (Item 1),
and Applicant’s response to the FORM (AE A), I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 65 years old and a native of Afghanistan. Applicant and his spouse
married in October 1978. They have two grown children ages 38 and 33. Applicant, his
spouse, and son came to the United States in February 1985 seeking asylum. In May
2000, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen. (Items 2-3.)
From October 1992 to July 2009, Applicant was managing partner of a wholesale
business  until  it  closed.  From  July  2009  to  November  2009,  Applicant  worked  for  his
current employer, a defense contractor, as a linguist in Afghanistan for the U.S. military.
(Item 2.) He lost his job after he had left his post to get some food with two co-workers.
Applicant knew he was not supposed to leave his post, but he had seen others leaving,
and he was only off the post for 10 to 15 minutes. (Item 3.) Applicant explained on his
SCA, and to an OPM investigator on July 30, 2018, that he was also having problems at
home at the time. (Items 2-3.)
When he responded to the SOR, Applicant explained that he had purchased a liquor
store for $300,000 in 2010 with all his savings and a loan obtained from refinancing the
mortgage on his home. (Item 1.) Available financial information indicates that Applicant
paid off the $81,933 mortgage on his home and obtained a new mortgage of $150,000 in
July 2010, to be repaid at $2,323 per month. (Item 4.)
Applicant inaccurately reported on his SCA that he worked for his spouse only from
January 2011 to November 2011. (Item 2.) He apparently managed his spouse’s liquor
store on his return from Afghanistan. Applicant explained that the liquor store was in a bad
location with low customer traffic, and that almost from the beginning, he “had a hard time
running the store.” Applicant was new to the business, and he lacked knowledge about
inventory and customer preferences. Almost from the start, he relied on his personal credit
to  stock  inventory  for  the  business.  He  also  used  his  credit  cards  to  pay  personal
expenses, which included monthly expenses of $2,323 for his mortgage, $500 for utilities,
$200 for phone service, $1,000 for groceries, and $300 for car insurance. Applicant paid
the monthly minimums on his credit cards for awhile. (Item 1.) He defaulted on four credit-
card accounts between September 2014 and September 2015 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d). (Item 4.)
In approximately 2015, he and his spouse sold the liquor store. According to Applicant, he
“received very little money for the store and had to practically give it away just to stop [him]
having to use [his] credit cards anymore.” Applicant asserts that he could not find another
job for over a year. (Item 1.) On his June 2018 SCA, Applicant indicated that he held two
part-time jobs from August 2016 to May 2018, as a front-desk clerk at a motel and as a
cashier at a convenience store. (Item 2.)
In January 2017, Applicant retained an attorney to negotiate settlements for his four
seriously delinquent credit-card accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d). Applicant had a little money
from  his minimum-wage  jobs to make small payments. (Item 1.)  In mid-January 2017,
Applicant’s attorney faxed letters to Applicant’s creditors for three of Applicant’s debts,
indicating that Applicant could pay ten percent of his balances in settlement, so $1,173 on
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b, $809 on the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c, and $795 on the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d.
According to Applicant, his largest debt of $22,580 had not yet been referred to collections,
so his attorney did not propose a settlement at that time. However, Applicant could not pay
the amounts that his credit lenders wanted to settle his debts. (Item 1.)
In May 2018, Applicant applied for a linguist position with his current employer. On
June 18, 2018, Applicant completed a personal financial statement on which he listed net
monthly  income  totaling  $4,600  for  him  and  his  spouse.  After  paying  their  monthly
expenses of $2,050 and $2,300 for their mortgage, they had $250 in monthly discretionary
income. Applicant listed two accounts other than his mortgage which were current: a credit
card with a $2,972 balance and an account with a $180 balance. He reported no monthly
payment on those debts. He also listed the four delinquent accounts in the SOR totaling
$50,366.  The  personal  financial  statement  included  a  remark  that  “CANDIDATE  is  in
contact with the creditors for HIS unresolved debt.” (Item 5.)
On  June  19,  2018,  he  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  an  SCA.  He
responded negatively to the SCA inquiries into any delinquency involving routine accounts,
including the following:
In the last seven (7) years, you had bills or debts turned over to a collection
agency? (Include financial obligations for which you were the sole debtor, as
well as those for which you were a cosigner or guarantor);
In the last seven (7) years, you had any account or credit card suspended,
charged  off,  or  cancelled  for  failing  to  pay  as  agreed?  (Include  financial
obligations for which you were the sole debtor, as well as those for which you
were a cosigner or guarantor); and
You are currently over 120 days delinquent on any debt? Include financial
obligations for which you are the sole debtor, as well as those for which you
are a cosigner or guarantor).
Applicant listed some foreign travel on his SCA, including to Germany in July 2016
to visit family, and to Mexico in August 2017, reportedly for volunteer purposes. (Item 2.)
Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator on July 30, 2018. He told the
investigator  that  he  worked  at  his  spouse’s  liquor  store  until  August  2016  when  the
business closed. He explained that he had not yet started working as a linguist. About his
trip to Mexico, Applicant stated that it was a pleasure trip with family and that he had been
mistaken when he listed it as a volunteer trip. A review of his U.S. passport showed that he
traveled to Germany in April 2010, February 2011, August 2011, May 2012, August 2012,
September 2013, and July 2015. When asked about any financial problems, Applicant
acknowledged that because of his spouse’s liquor store not being profitable, he has been
late about six months on the credit-card accounts with the lenders identified in the SOR,
but that he has contacted the creditors and advised them that he would contact them about
repayment arrangements once he began working with his employer. He explained that the
credit cards were used for his spouse’s liquor business. (Item 3.) There is no indication in
the record that Applicant was asked why he had not disclosed the delinquencies on his
SCA.
As of April 17, 2019, Applicant owed charged-off credit-card balances of $22,580
(SOR ¶ 1.a, no activity since September 2014); $11,737 (SOR ¶ 1.b, no activity since
September 2015); and $7,953 (SOR ¶ 1.d, no activity since November 2014). Additionally,
$8,096 was owed on a credit-card account placed for collection in October 2016 due to
inactivity since February 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.c). (Item 4.)
On  a  date  not  specified  in  the  record,  Applicant  began  working  as  a  linguist  in
Afghanistan for his employer. He was apparently granted a DOD clearance because he
asks that his security clearance not be revoked. (Item 1.) After Applicant received the SOR,
he retained the services of his attorney to again enter into settlement negotiations for him
with  his  creditors.  Applicant’s  attorney  faxed  letters  to  Applicant’s  creditors  offering
settlements  of  ten  percent  of  Applicant’s  outstanding  balances.  The  creditor owed  the
debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b countered by asking for half of Applicant’s balances. The
attorney  then  offered  settlement  terms  of  20  percent.  If  that  offer  was  rejected  by  the
creditor, Applicant’s attorney planned to offer a settlement amount of 25 percent “as a full
and final offer.” The collection entity for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c could not locate the file. The
creditor owed the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d demanded full payment of Applicant’s $7,953 balance.
Applicant’s attorney countered by offering 25 percent of the debt “as a full and final offer.”
As of Applicant’s August 16, 2019 response to the SOR, no settlements had been reached
on  Applicant’s  delinquent  accounts.  In  notifying  Applicant  of  his  attempts  to  arrange
settlements, the attorney added:
I  have  asked  all  the  credit  card  companies  for  a  written  answer  to  our
settlement  offer  because  it  is  important  to  us  to  prove  to  the  judge  in  a
hearing that you tried to settle the debts with the limited money you have but
they will not settle with you on reasonable amounts. We will also let the judge
know that you are trying very hard to settle but you can’t make an offer for
more money than you actually have. (Item 1.)
While working in Afghanistan, Applicant executed an affidavit in response to the
SOR  in  which  he  expressed  his  intention  to  settle  his debts  because  he  is in  a  better
financial  situation  “now  working  in  this  current  job  with  the  Department  of  Defense.”
Applicant stated with regard to his failure to disclose his delinquencies on his June 2018
SCA:
I  am  a  very  honest  person  and  would  never  willingly  falsely  answer  a
question  on  an  application  for  employment.  In  regard  to  the  [SCA],  I
mistakenly answered in the negative to the questions about current and past
credit debts because I did not understand the question. (Item 1.)
Applicant  did  not  elaborate  in  the  affidavit  about  the  nature  of  his  reported
misunderstanding of the SCA inquiries.
In response to the FORM, Applicant provided a letter from the collection entity for
the $8,095 debt (SOR ¶ 1.c) confirming that Applicant, through his attorney, arranged on
December 17, 2019, to pay $5,262 by January 30, 2020, in full settlement. Applicant’s
attorney had arranged, as of December 9, 2019, for Applicant to pay $4,773 by December
27, 2019, to settle his $7,953 balance with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.d. Applicant consented
to an entry of judgment against him for the full $7,953 minus any payments if he failed to
pay  the  settlement  amount  by  the  deadline.  In  a  January  7,  2020  affidavit,  Applicant
indicated that his attorney was still waiting for the creditor owed the delinquencies in SOR
¶¶ 1.a and 1.b to “send [its] settlement agreements on [his] two accounts before I can
make payments on any of the cards because I have to see if I have enough money to pay
all these credit- card companies now.” Applicant added that he needs his job as a linguist
to make the settlement payments and that he is trying his best to save the money to make
the payments. Should he not have enough money to pay off the settlements in full, he asks
that he be given more time to make the payments “or waive the requirement that [he] must
pay them off all in full in order to keep [his] job with the DOD.” He asserts that he loves the
United States and his job working as a linguist in Afghanistan for the U.S. military, and that
he is a reliable and trustworthy person who “just fell on hard times through a business loss
and for no other reason.” (AE A.)
Applicant provided no evidence of any payments toward the debts in the SOR. He
submitted  no  information  about  his  current  income  or  his  savings,  thus  precluding  a
reasonable  assessment  of  his  financial  situation.  No  information  was  submitted  as  to
whether Applicant has had any financial counseling.
