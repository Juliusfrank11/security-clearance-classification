Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  her  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the  pleadings,  including  Applicant’s  admissions  to  two  of  the  three  SOR  allegations,
Applicant’s  testimony  and  that  of  her  witness  at  the  hearing,  and  the  documentary
evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant, 60, has worked as a software engineer for a major U.S. Government
contractor since 2003. She has held a security clearance since at least 2008. She  was
awarded a bachelor’s degree in 1981 and a master’s degree in 2008. In addition, she has
earned two professional certifications in her field. She married in 1987 and divorced in
2003. She has no children. She has owned her present home since at least 2011. (Tr. at
39, 40, 42.)
In her SCA, Applicant disclosed that she had not filed her federal and state income
tax returns for the tax years (TY) 2012 through 2016. In her September 2018 background
interview, she stated that she had filed for an extension to file her  TY 2017 tax returns
that expired in October 2018. In her SOR answer, she admitted that she still had not filed
her 2012 through 2016 federal and state tax returns and that she had not filed her 2017
returns. At the hearing, she testified that these returns remained unfiled and that she had
also not filed her TY 2018 federal and state tax returns. Since her failure to file her 2018
returns was not alleged in the SOR,  this fact will only be used to determine mitigation.
(GE 2 at 2; Tr. at 52, 57-58.)
Applicant  claims  that  she  did  not  file  her federal  and  state  personal  income  tax
returns for TY 2012 through 2015 because her 2010 and 2011 federal tax returns were
under audit by the IRS. The IRS examined certain tax deductions taken by Applicant in
those returns. She testified that she felt strongly that her deductions were proper. The
IRS disagreed in part and the audits were concluded in January 2016. The IRS advised
her in a letter what deductions were permissible and what were not. She was also advised
that she would be subjected to penalties for failing to file her returns on time. (Tr. at 47-
51, 60-63.)
As noted, the IRS disallowed some of Applicant’s contested tax deductions in 2010
and  2011.  She  claimed  that  she has  paid  the  taxes  due for 2010.  Applicant  Exhibit  A,
however, reflects that she has an outstanding balance of about $2,000. The exhibit also
notes that the balance is “currently not collectable.”  She admitted that she owed about
$16,000  for  2011.  She  claims  she  is  paying  that  debt,  but  AE  B  reflects  that  her  last
payment on her TY 2012 taxes was made in April 2016. AE B also states that as of March
2019, this tax debt is “currently not collectable.” (AE A at 2; AE B at 4; Tr. at 47-52.)
Since the completion of the audits for TY 2010 and 2011 in 2016, Applicant has
not filed her returns for TY 2012 through 2015, nor has she filed her more recent returns.
She claims that she had extenuating circumstances that prevented her from filing.  Her
2012 tax returns were not filed on time because the mortgage lender on her home was
seeking  to  foreclose  on  the  property.  In  2013,  she  was  successful  in  obtaining  a
modification of the mortgage loan. At that point, she was involved in a contentious dispute
with the IRS over her tax deductions. She refused to file any further returns until the issue
was  resolved  because  she  knew  she  would  be  claiming  the  same  deductions  in  her
returns for the years after 2011. (Tr. at 45-48.)
Applicant had a number of other excuses for her delay after the completion of the
audit. The main one was that she learned in 2016 that she had mold in her house. She
began to experience health issues due to the mold. She was on disability for four months
at the end of 2016. More mold was discovered in 2017. She was also busy traveling to
Europe for work. On one occasion her roof leaked and caused additional mold problems.
On  another  occasion,  her  garage  was  flooded  causing  more  mold.  She  kept  her  tax
paperwork in the garage. She was frequently displaced from her house while contractors
repaired the recurring mold damage. At the time of the hearing, she had been living in a
hotel for most of 2019. (Tr. at 37-38, 52-58.)
Applicant hired a tax advisor a week or two before the hearing. The advisor testified
that  the  returns  would  be  filed  by  February  6,  2020,  because  that  was  the  deadline
imposed by the IRS. She had contacted the IRS and was told that the IRS did not require
Applicant  to  file  returns  for  TY  2012  and  2013.  Applicant  testified  that  her  home
contractors are helping her by removing boxes of financial records from her residence so
that she can turn the records over to her tax advisor. After the hearing, no evidence was
provided that the delinquent federal tax returns were filed. Also, no reason was given to
explain the lack of such evidence. (Tr. at 16-17, 57-58.)
After the hearing, the office of Applicant’s counsel provided the first page of state
tax  returns  for  TY  2014  through  2017.  The  exhibits  only  reflect  Applicant’s  identifying
information, filing status, and single personal exemption. There is no indication that these
returns  have  been  completed,  signed,  and  filed  or  whether  she  owes  any  state  taxes.
There  is  also  no  accompanying  representation  from  Applicant,  her  tax  advisor,  or  her
attorney that these returns have been filed. Furthermore, there is no explanation for the
omission of state tax returns TY 2012 and 2013, the first two years alleged in the SOR.
The  record  is  similarly  silent  as  to  whether  Applicant  filed  her  2018  state  tax  returns.
Applicant  Exhibit  C,  however,  is  a  letter  from  her  state  tax  authorities.  It  reflects  that
Applicant’s state taxes for TY 2014 were fully paid in 2018. (AE C-G.)
