In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  34-year-old  linguist  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  May
2011. He is seeking to work on a contract that requires a security clearance.
Guideline B, Foreign Influence
The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline B, based on Applicant’s family
connections to Iraq. He was born in Iraq. He married an Iraqi woman in January 2007.
His wife is now a U.S. citizen. They have two children, ages 11 and 6, who are native-
born U.S. citizens.
Applicant was employed by a defense contractor and served with U.S. Forces in
Iraq  from  February  2006  to  October  2008.  He  was  involved  in  direct  combat  and
participated  in  numerous  security  missions,  reconnaissance  missions,  and  prisoner
apprehensions.  He  received  numerous  accolades  and  certificates attesting  to  his hard
work, bravery, reliability, and dedication. The Army officers and noncommissioned officers
with whom he served strongly supported his application for a special immigrant visa. (AX
A through AX L; AX T through Y; AX Z.)
Applicant, his mother, his wife, and his youngest sister came to the United States
in October 2008 on a special immigrant visa. He and his family lived in the United States
with the U.S. Army captain for whom he worked in Iraq. (Tr. 41.)  His mother and sister
returned  to  Iraq  after  living  in  the  United  States  for  about  11  months.  (Tr.  45,  57.)  He
became a U.S. citizen in January 2014.
In  2009,  Applicant  decided  to  enlist  in  the  U.S.  Army  as  a  linguist.  He  took  the
Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery twice and failed it. He passed on the third
try.  Before  he  could  enlist,  his  wife  was  hospitalized  and  disabled  for  several  months.
Instead of enlisting, he applied for a linguist position with a defense contractor and was
hired. (Tr. 125-29.)
Applicant was employed by this defense contractor from September 2009 to July
2011. He worked intermittently as a cultural role player during pre-deployment training in
the  United  States  for  U.S.  Army  units  on  their  way  to  Iraq.  (GX  1  at  16-17.)  He  again
received  numerous  certificates  of  appreciation  for  his  dedication  and  service.  (AX  N
through R; AX OO.)
From May 2011 to May 2017, Applicant was employed by a federal contractor as
an  audio  technician  operating  a  broadcasting  system  for  another  government  agency
(AGA). He was commended for his skill, dedication, and teamwork. (AX OO.)
Applicant’s mother, brother, three sisters, uncle, two brothers-in-law, and mother-
in-law, are citizens and residents of Iraq. His father served as a bandsman in  the Iraqi
Army,  retired  with  a  pension,  and  is  now  deceased.  (Tr.  47.).  Applicant  has  monthly
contact with his mother by social media. (Tr. 45.) She is supported by his father’s military
pension. (Tr.
Applicant’s brother is employed by the Iraq Ministry of Interior, was trained by U.S.
Forces  in  2005,  and  works  as  an  unarmed  security  officer  for  the  Facilities  Protection
Service in Iraq. Applicant talks to his brother between two times and four times a year by
social media. (Tr. 50.)
Applicant has had no contact with his oldest sister since he visited her in Iraq in
2014. The lack of contact is due to a poor relationship between her and Applicant’s wife.
(Tr. 52.) He talks to his middle sister two or three times a year. His last contact with his
youngest sister was in 2014, when she returned to Iraq.
Applicant has had no personal contact with his mother-in-law and brothers-in-law
since 2014. His last personal contact with his uncle was in 2017, when his uncle visited
the  United  States  in  connection  with  personal  business  in  Iraq.  (Tr.  59.)  Applicant
communicates with his uncle about twice a year by text message. (Tr. 61.)
Applicant’s  wife  talks to  her mother  and  one  of  her sisters in  Iraq about twice  a
week. His wife’s other sister lives in Turkey. Applicant exchanges greetings with his wife’s
mother about twice a year. He last visited her in person in 2014. (Tr. 62-63, 65-66.)
One of Applicant’s brothers-in-law is a teacher in an Iraqi government school. His
wife talks to her brother about once a month, and Applicant exchanges greetings with him
occasionally.  (Tr.  67.)  Applicant’s  other  brother-in-law  owns  a  small  grocery  store.
Applicant’s wife talks to this brother-in-law about once a month, and Applicant exchanges
greetings with him about once a year. (Tr. 69.)
Iraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. Iraqi parliamentary elections in 2014
generally  met  international  standards  of  free  and  fair  elections  and  led  to  a  peaceful
transition of power. The United States regards Iraq as a key partner in the region as well
as a voice of moderation and democracy in the Middle East, and it maintains vigorous
and broad engagement with Iraq on diplomatic, political, economic, and security issues.
U.S.  assistance  to  Iraq  focuses  on  economic  reform,  assistance  to  vulnerable  groups,
democracy,  and  governance.  U.S.  security  assistance  supports  the  development  of  a
modern,  accountable,  fiscally  sustainable,  and  professional  Iraqi  military  capable  of
defending Iraq and its borders.
The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is a designated terrorist organization that
controls some areas of Syria on the Iraqi border and remains a threat to public safety in
Iraq through indiscriminate terrorist attacks. ISIS, criminal gangs, and local militias pose
a potential threat to U.S. citizens and interests. The Department of State travel advisory
for Iraq is Level 4: “Do not travel to Iraq due to terrorism and armed conflict.”
Iraq’s most significant human rights issues include allegations of unlawful killings
by some members of the Iraqi Security Forces, forced disappearances, torture, arbitrary
detention, and widespread official corruption. Iraqi citizens are not eligible for travel to the
United States under the Visa Waiver program, which permits citizens of certain countries
to travel to the United States for business or tourism for up to 90 days without a visa.
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
The  SOR  alleges  ten  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $56,779.  The  debts  are
reflected in credit reports from March 2017, May 2017, and April 2019. (GX 3, 4 and 5.)
Applicant testified that his financial problems began in 2017, when his income was
drastically reduced. He had been working for a contractor supporting an AGA. He worked
at night, earning a night differential, and working overtime. He earned $84,000 in  2014
and  $73,000  in  2015.  Due  to  budget  cuts,  his  employer  stopped  his  night  work  and
overtime, reducing his annual income to about $31,800. (Tr. 104-09.) When his pay was
reduced, he kept his house payments current but fell behind on his other debts. (GX 4 at
1; GX 5 at 1.) He hired a credit-repair company in April 2018. (Enclosure to SOR answer.)
He  terminated  his  contract  with  the  company  after  paying  $110  per  month  for  three
months  and  decided  to  deal  directly  with  his  creditors.  (Tr.  114-15.)  The  evidence
concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.

SOR  ¶  2.d:  automobile  lease  referred  for  collection  of  $24,965.  Applicant

unidentified person that he should lease a car instead of buying one. In 2012, he traded
in his $35,000 car and leased a luxury car for three years. (Tr. 33; GX 5 at 3.) He had a
dispute with the dealership about a $2,300 repair that he thought should covered by the
warranty.  He  stopped  making  payments  and  the  car  was  repossessed  in  September
2015. (Tr. 81-83; GX 5 at 1.) In his answer to the SOR, he submitted evidence that he
received a settlement offer in February 2019, and he settled the debt in April 2019 for less
than the full amount.

the purchase of a television. It was charged off in February 2016 and was referred to the
