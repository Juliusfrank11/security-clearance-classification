Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since 2011, but he moved to a different location in 2015. He seeks
to retain a security clearance, which he has held since about 2011. He has a bachelor’s
degree  that  was  awarded  in  2011  and  additional  credits  but  no  post-graduate  degree.
He is single without children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 40-41, 43; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  asserted  that  his  move  to  a  different  location  for  his  job  in  2015  was
more  costly  than  he  anticipated.  His  rent  increased  by  $400  per  month.  His  car  was
wrecked  in  an  accident  in  2015,  and  he  had  to  buy  a  new  car.  With  the  added
expenses, he was unable to pay all his bills. A number of accounts became delinquent,
and his student loans went into default. (Tr. at 17, 28-31; GE 2-4)
The  SOR  alleges  four  defaulted  student  loans  totaling  $91,624,  with  two  of  the
loans  reduced  to  judgments,  and  four  miscellaneous  delinquent  debts  with  balances
totaling about $28,000. Applicant admitted owing all the debts, but he stated that he was
making arrangements to pay them.
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
April 2018. He reported his four defaulted student loans as well as the debts alleged in
SOR  ¶¶  1.f  and  1.h,  which  he  listed  as  being  $1,345  and  $2,132.  Those  figures
reflected the past-due amounts, not the balances. He indicated that he planned to take
out  a  loan from  his 401(k)  retirement  plan to  pay  the  majority  of his student  loans.  He
stated that he was working overtime and putting money aside, which he planned to use
to pay the two delinquent debts the following month. (GE 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  June  2018.  He
discussed his financial problems. He stated that he planned to pay his delinquent debts
and  defaulted  student  loans.  He  indicated  that  he  was  considering  using  his  401(k)
funds to pay his debts. (GE 2)
The DOD obtained Applicant’s credit report in April 2019. The report listed all of
the  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  The  report  listed  the  account  for  the  past-due  debt
alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.g  was  opened  in  June  2018,  and  the  last  payment  was  made  in
October  2018.  The  most  recent  payment  on  the  other  delinquent  debts  and  defaulted
loans  was  made  in  May  2018.  The  credit  report  also  listed  that  Applicant  was  $1,167
past due on his auto loan, and that he was past due a total of $174 on three other small
debts. He had to travel internationally after a family member passed away in a foreign
country.  He  testified  that  he  is  still  two  months  behind  on  the  auto  loan,  but  he  is
attempting to get caught up.1 (Tr. at 38-39; GE 4)
1 The auto loan and the three small past-due debts were not alleged in the SOR. Any matter that was not
alleged in the SOR will not be used for disqualification purposes. It may be considered when assessing
Applicant’s  overall  financial  situation,  in  the  application  of  mitigating  conditions,  and  during  the  whole-
person analysis.
The  same  lender  owns  the  four  defaulted  student  loans.  The  lender  obtained
judgments  against  Applicant  for  at  least  two  of  the  loans.  His  wages  were  garnished
$8,447 in 2019 to satisfy the judgment for the $8,076 defaulted loan alleged in SOR ¶
1.e.  He  has  not  documented  any  payments  toward  the  three  other  defaulted  student
loans.  The  lender  may  attempt  to  enforce  the  other  judgment  or  judgments  by
garnishment. Applicant testified that he owed $975 on the loan against his 401(k), and
after that loan is paid, he will take out another loan to pay his two smaller student loans
($26,802  and  $15,464).  His  pay  statement  for  the  one-week  pay  period  ending
December  20,  2019,  indicated  that  $51  was  deducted  for  his  401(k)  loan,  and  that
$2,686 had been deducted year-to-date. (Tr. at 17-22, 31-34, 39; Applicant’s response
to SOR; GE 2-4; AE A, G, K-M)
The  bank  that  is owed  the $7,295  debt alleged  in SOR  ¶ 1.f  sued Applicant for
payment. In July 2019, the bank and Applicant entered into a stipulation for payment in
full. Applicant agreed to pay at least $200 a month until $7,295 plus $364 court costs is
paid in full. He provided documentation that he made the four required $200 payments
since August 2019. (Tr. at 21-25, 34-35; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE B,
G, J)
Applicant entered into a payment agreement with the collection company for the
debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.g.  He  agreed  to  pay  $53  until  the  $637  balance  (alleged  as
$544 in SOR) is paid in full. He provided documentation that he made the four required
$53 payments since September 2019, which reduced the balance to $424. (Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE D-G, I)
Applicant and the collection company for the $11,673 debt alleged in SOR  ¶ 1.h
entered into a $98 per month payment agreement, with the first payment made on May
17,  2019.  The  payments  are  electronically  withdrawn  from  his  bank  account.  He  has
made all seven required payments. The balance in December 2019 was $11,317. (Tr. at
26-27, 35; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE C, G, H)
Applicant has not made any payment arrangements for the $8,815 debt alleged
in  SOR  ¶  1.d.  He  stated  that  he  intends  to  pay  his  debts.  He  will  continue  with  the
payment plans in place, pay off two student loans with the proceeds from a loan against
his  401(k),  and  arrange  payment  plans  for  the  fourth  student  loan  and  remaining
delinquent  debt.  He  has  conducted  independent  research  on  finances,  but  he  has  not
received formal financial counseling. (T. at 35-36, 41-45; Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 3, 4)
