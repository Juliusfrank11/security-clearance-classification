Applicant is a 54-year-old software engineer who has been employed by a defense
contractor since October 2014 when he changed from being a contractor for the company
to being a full-time permanent employee. (Tr. 10) He was unemployed from March 2014
through  September  2014.  (Ex.  2)  Applicant  received  a  congratulation  letter  for  his  30
years of service with his company. (Ex. B) He seeks to retain a security clearance. (Tr. 6)
He is widowed. (Tr. 14) He has not served in the military. His annual salary for 2019, was
approximately $130,000. (Ex. A, Tr. 70)
Applicant  took  his  credit  card  accounts  to  unsafe  levels,  cashed  out  his  401(k)
retirement  plan  of  approximately  $300,000,  and  sold  investments  worth  $83,242  to
provide money to women he met at gentlemen’s clubs. (Tr. 14, Tr. 30, Ex. K and L) He
acknowledged his poor judgment for these actions. (Tr. 14) Applicant owed $112,280 in
federal income taxes for tax years 2014 through 2016. (Ex. 2)
There are no credit card accounts currently of concern. On Applicant’s May 2017
Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), he stated he had paid off two credit
card accounts and two credit union accounts totaling $70,637. (Ex. 1) He asserted he had
entered  into  a  debt-relief  program  to  successfully  pay  off  all  of  his  accounts.  (Ex.  1)
Applicant’s July 2017 and March 2019 credit reports indicate Applicant has no past due
accounts. (Ex. 3, 4)
In Applicant’s May 2017 e-QIP, he indicated he had not filed or paid his federal
income taxes for tax years 2014 and 2015. (Ex. 1) He stated:
I filed my 2014 taxes as required, requesting and receiving an extension. At
the due date of my extension I made a payment of less that the complete
amount due as, after cashing out my 401k, I ended up not having the funds
to pay the additional taxes due to early withdrawal penalties. Note: the 401k
funds  were  withdrawn  largely  as  a  result  of  my  having  been  laid  off  in
February of 2014 and I wanted to pay off existing credit card debt. I was not
contacted to pay the remainder of the 2014 taxes and, after hiring [tax firm]
to  assist  in  reaching  a  settlement  with  both  the  2015  and  2014  taxes,
discovered there had been an identity theft and the IRS had no record of
my filing. Thankfully, the record of payments, insufficient though they were,
was found.
On Applicant’s e-QIP he stated about tax year 2015, “I had insufficient funds to
pay the balanced owed at the conclusion of my extension. The amount owed was higher
than expected due to the money saved by my credit card settlements being charged as
income.” (Ex. 1) He listing owing federal income taxes of $36,385 for tax year 2015 and
estimated  he  owed  $50,000  for  tax  year  2014.  (Ex.  1)  Available  federal  income  tax

*Amount of federal tax due as of July 2019. (Ex. I)
** Applicant paid $505 when he filed his return, which was the amount of tax owing for
tax year 2013.
*** In an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) July 2019 letter, it states the IRS was not able
to  process  Applicant’s  transcript  request  for  tax  year  2014.  (Ex.  I)  The  June  2019
installment agreement with the IRS lists $60,487 owed for tax year 2014, and $112,280
in total federal income taxes due for tax years 2014 through tax year 2016. (Ex. 2)
**** The $1,329 tax refund for tax year 2018 was applied to Applicant’s tax balance for
tax year 2015. (Ex. I)
On July 5, 2019, Applicant completed his responses to written interrogatories in
which he stated he had a tax preparer file an extension for his 2014 federal income tax
return (Ex. 2, Tr. 52) Applicant believed his tax preparer would file his return  within the
extended deadline. His tax preparer never contacted him again to inform him how much
was owed for tax year 2014. (Tr. 53) The 2014 federal income tax return was not filed
until 2017. (Tr. 33) Applicant did not file his 2015 tax return until December 2016. (Ex. 2,
Tr.55) He lives in a state that does not have a state income tax obligation.
On November 2018, Applicant made an unsworn declaration during an enhanced
subject interview. (Ex. 2) He stated he had hired a tax firm to help him address his past-
due federal taxes.  (Tr.  20)  The firm  was  attempting  to negotiate  a reduction  of his tax
burden.  (Tr.  62)  There  was  to  be  a  hearing  with  the  IRS  at  which  the  tax  firm  was  to
represent his interests before the IRS. (Tr. 62) In March 2017, Applicant made an initial
payment of $6,000 to a tax firm to help him with his federal taxes. (Ex. D) He then started
making $600 monthly payments to the firm. Between March 2017 and January 2020, he
paid  the  tax  firm  $25,200  for  assistance  in  obtaining  a  reduction  of  this  federal  tax
delinquency. (Ex. D, J) As of March 2020, the attempt was unsuccessful, and he ended
the $600 monthly payment to the tax firm. (Ex. J)
Applicant had entered into an installment agreement with the IRS and paid $10,000
on April 15, 2015, on his 2014 federal income tax obligation. On October 20, 2015, he
made  a  payment  of  $100  on  his  2014  tax  obligation.  (Ex.  F)  In  2016,  he  made  two
additional payments totaling $121 to address his 2015 federal tax obligation. (Ex. F) In
May 2019, entered into a repayment agreement with the IRS agreeing to make monthly
payments of $1,387 to repay past-due taxes with his first payment due June 28, 2019.
(Ex.  2,  Tr.  20)  His  monthly  installment  payments  to  the  IRS  remain  timely  and
uninterrupted. (Ex. J., Tr. 60) Between March 16, 2016, and February 24, 2019, he made
11 payments totaling $13,696 to the IRS toward his 2014, 2015, and 2017 tax year taxes.
(Ex. F, M)
In 1997-1998, Applicant provided $6,000 to a woman not further identified in the
record. In 2000, he provided $60,000 to another woman SA. (Tr. 38) Those funds were
not  repaid.  (Tr.  39)  He  had  a  sexual  relationship  with  SA,  but  he  asserts  the  money
provided was not payment for a sexual relationship or sexual conduct. (Tr. 43) He denied
having had sexual intercourse with the other woman, but had “intimate relations,” which
were not further explained in the record. (Tr. 43)
During  Applicant’s  November  2018  subject  interview,  he  was  questioned  about
$28,725  in  payments  he  had  made  to  three  women.  He  acknowledges  he  used  poor
judgment  in  providing  money  to  women  (AB,  LW,  and  JS)  that  he  met  in  gentlemen’s
clubs. (Ex. 2, Tr. 36) He started lending money to these individuals starting in 2010. (Tr.
35) When he provided the money, he believed AB would not repay the money he gave
her. He believed LW and JS would repay him. (Ex. 2) He stated he provided money to
LW to help her with her Lupus treatment including nursing care and medical costs. As of
November 2018, he was still providing monies to help LW with her medical expenses.
(Ex. 2) He was intimate with some, but not all of the women that he provided with money.
(Tr. 40)
Applicant met LW at a gentleman’s club, where she was a dancer. (Tr. 36) On June
14, 2012, a loan agreement was written between Applicant and LW. (Ex. C) However, the
agreement was never signed not notarized by LW. The loan document listed the collateral
provided  and  the  16.99%  interest  rate,  but  did  not  list  the  amount  of  the  loan  or  the
purpose of the loan. (Ex. C) The loan agreement gave Applicant the assurance and belief
that the money provided would ultimately be repaid. (Tr. 15) He had known LW for two
years  at  the  time  the  contract  was  written  and  in  2012,  they  lived  together  for
approximately four months. (Tr. 23) In total, he provided her with $350,000. (Tr. 24) He
believes  he  will  be  repaid  the  funds  in  May  or  June  2020.  (Tr.  25)  She  anticipated
receiving funds from an automobile accident. (Tr. 25) Applicant still maintains contact with
LW. He had received a text message from LW the day of the hearing. (Tr. 43)
Applicant  met  JS  at  the  same  gentleman’s  club  where  she  was  and  LW  were
bother dancers. (Tr. 36) He stopped going to gentleman’s clubs in 2012, because he had
no  more  money.  (Tr.  46)  He  knew  JS  approximately  three  years  and  he  provided  her
money over a course of time. (Tr. 27) He provided her approximately $177,000, believing
the money  would  be  repaid from an  insurance  payoff  she  was  expecting.  (Tr. 29) The
money he gave JS was used by her for child care and living expenses. (Tr. 29) He last
saw JS six to eight months ago. (Tr. 29) He now believes the funds will not be repaid and
that  if  she  received an  insurance  payout, the  money  has  been  spent.  (Tr. 30) He  also
provided JS’s sister $64,000. (Tr. 33)
Applicant knew AB approximately three years when he loaned her money. (Tr. 27)
AB worked as a waitress at the same gentleman’s club, where JS and MW were dancers.
(Tr. 36) Applicant and AB were friends and he provided her approximately $10,000 over
a period of time, believing the money would not be repaid. (Tr. 27, 47) The money was
provided  in  a  number of  transactions  with  her using  the money  for child  care,  medical
expenses, and living expenses. (Tr. 27-28) He last saw her eight months ago. (Tr. 28)
Applicant asserts he  has known the woman he provided the money to for more
than ten years. Over that period he had intimacy with them less than ten times. (Ex. J)
The most recent contact he had with any of the individuals was in June 2019. (Ex. J)
Three  of  the  women:  ML,  AB,  and  JS  performed  sexual  acts  on  Applicant  after
which he provided them with money. (Tr. 40) However, he initially asserted the money
provided was not payment for sexual acts. (Tr. 41) He then stated the money was for the
intimate acts but not for sexual intercourse. (Tr. 41) He acknowledged the women would
come  to  his  location,  a  sexual  act  (not  intercourse)  would  take  place,  money  was
exchanged,  and  the  women  would  leave.  (Tr.  42)  He  then  agreed  the  money  was  for
sexual services. (Tr. 43) He was last intimate with ML in 2014, with AB two years ago,
and with JS six months ago. (Tr. 45, 47, 48, 82) During 2018 and 2019, Applicant provided
no money to any women other than ML. (Tr. 81) During that time period, he gave ML $200
on one occasion and $500 on another. (Tr. 82) During those two years, he had less than
ten contact with the women. (Tr. 83)
Applicant stated he provided the financial assistance expecting in good faith to be
paid back. Three of the individuals were waiting for legal settlements to receive delinquent
child  support  payments,  funds  from  being  injured  in  an  automobile  accident,  and
settlement on the death of a spouse. (Tr. 20) He asserted about his financial issues,
The needs of my friends, couple with their delayed repayments, forced me
to use credit cards to an unsafe level. The increased credit card usage and
accompanying bills resulted in my borrowing against my 401(k) and selling
my investments. (Tr. 20)
After Applicant was laid off from his job in March 2014, he thought liquidating his
401(k)  retirement  fund  was  a  reasonable  course  of  action.  (Tr.  21)  He  feared  the
impending loss of income when his severance pay expired, and with the assurance of
imminent  repayment  of the funds  provided his friends,  he  believed  he  could  repay  the
funds withdrawn from his 401(k). (Tr. 21) He had approximately $300,000 in his 401(k) at
the time he liquidated it. (Tr. 30)
As Applicant’s severance pay was ending, he was rehired as a contractor by the
company from which he had been laid off. However, his new pay when rehired was only
two-thirds of his previous pay. (Tr. 21) With reduced income and high credit card bills, he
entered into a high-interest loan in a credit card resettlement agreement in 2016. (Tr. 20,
64)  Through  the  credit  relief  service  he  consolidated  his  credit-card  accounts  and
obtained  a  $31,000  personal  loan  with  a  21%  interest  rate  to  address  his  credit-card
debts. (Tr. 66, 67) He says payment on the loan will continue for many more years. (Tr.
20) His budget includes a monthly amount of $1,036 to a financial company. (Ex. H) The
company  lists  itself  as  a  financial  network  helping  people  overcome  debt  to  achieve
financial stability through their proven solutions for debt settlement, mortgage shopping,
and  personal  loans.  All  services  provided  by  the  financial  company  ended  with  he
obtained the loan. (Tr. 67) He no longer makes payment to the credit relief service, but
still makes timely monthly payments on the loan. (Tr. 66)
Applicant does not appear to be living above his means. His monthly income is
$6,638,  and  his  budget  showed  expenses  of  $6,073,  which  left  $565  of  disposable
income. (Ex. H) The budget as presented included monthly payments of $600 to the tax
firm, $1,387 to the IRS, and $1,036 to the debt relief program. (Ex. H) It also included an
additional $3,600 for utilities, insurance, rent, food, automobile payment, food, clothing,
and  credit  card  payment.  (Ex.  H)  He  drives  a  2009  automobile.  (Tr.  76)  As  previously
stated he no longer makes the $600 monthly payments to the tax firm, which increases
his monthly disposable income to $1,165.
