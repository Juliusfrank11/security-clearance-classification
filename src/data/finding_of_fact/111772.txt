In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  43-year-old  technician  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since
October 2016. He was employed as an enrollment advisor at a university from April 2015
to October 2016, and he left this job voluntarily to accept his current employment. (FORM
Item 2 at 13-14.) He also has been self-employed since August 2005 as a process server.
He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from February 1996 to April 2005 and received
an honorable discharge. His security clearance application reflects that he has never held
a security clearance. (FORM Item 2 at 36.)
Applicant married in July 1996 and divorced in May 2005. He has three children,
ages 25, 22, and 9. He received a bachelor’s degree in May 2011.
The  SOR  alleges  seven  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $29,852,  which  are
reflected  in  credit  reports  from  May  30,  2019;  April  19,  2019;  and  February  10,  2018
(FORM Items 4-6.). The debts consist of collection accounts for $14,250 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and
$1,544  (SOR  ¶  1.d);  a  delinquent  charge  account  for  $3,492  (SOR  ¶  1.c);  and  four

otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
delinquent credit-card accounts for $4,280 (SOR ¶ 1.b); $2,921 (SOR ¶ 1.d); $2,349 (SOR
¶ 1.e); and $1.016 (SOR ¶ 1.g).
In  June  2019,  Applicant  entered  into  an  agreement  to  settle the  debt alleged  in
SOR ¶ 1.b for $1,800, to be paid at the rate of $150 per month beginning in July 2019
and ending in June 2020. (AX A.) He submitted AX A in his December 2019 response to
the FORM, but he submitted no evidence that he had made any of the required monthly
payments  from  July  through  December  2019.  He  also  submitted  no  evidence  of
payments,  payment  agreements,  or  other  resolution  of  the  other  debts  alleged  in  the
SOR.
When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator, he attributed his debts
to a slowdown in his process-server business. (FORM Item 3 at 4.) In his SOR answer,
he  stated  that  he  used  credit  cards  to  pay  living  expenses  due  to  having  a  change  in
careers. He provided no evidence explaining how a change in careers affected his ability
to  pay  his  debts.  He  stated  he  has  cut  down  on  his  spending,  but  he  submitted  no
evidence of a budget or plan to gain control of his finances. He submitted no evidence of
financial counseling and no evidence of negotiations or other actions to resolve the debts
in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c-1.g.
