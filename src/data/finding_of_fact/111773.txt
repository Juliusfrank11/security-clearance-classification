Applicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for
her current employer since about May 2016. She is applying for a security clearance for
the  first  time.  She  will  be  moved  to  a  better-paying  position  with  her  company  if  she
obtains a security clearance. She has an associate’s degree that was awarded in 2015,
and almost enough additional courses for a bachelor’s degree. She has never married,
and she has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 23-32, 44; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  financed  some  of  her  education  through  student  loans,  which  were
managed  by  her  mother.  She  played  basketball  for  her  college,  and  she  thought
medical  insurance  through  the  college  paid  her  medical  bills.  She  also  was  in  a  car
accident  and  had  medical  expenses.  She  did  not  earn  much  money  when  she  first
started working for her employer. Additionally, she was living with her mother, but had to
find her own apartment when her mother moved after Applicant’s father passed away in
about 2017. (Tr. at 21-22, 27, 30-43; GE1-4)
The SOR alleges eight defaulted federal student loans totaling about $38,600; a
defaulted  $1,830  private  student  loan  from  the  college  Applicant  attended;  and  six
delinquent  medical  debts  totaling  $487.  The  loans  and  debts  are  established  through
credit reports and Applicant’s admissions.
Applicant’s  pay  is  being  garnished  to  pay  her  federal  student  loans.  Her  pay
statement from Match 19, 2020, shows that $93 was garnished from her paycheck, and
$568 was garnished year-to-date. She retained a company that specializes in assisting
people  manage  their  student loans.  She  paid  the  company  $300 in  January  2020  and
another $300 in February 2020. She entered into a $5 per month payment plan for her
Department of Education loans, which should stop the garnishment. She made the first
two  required  payments.  When  she  completes  the  payment  plan  in  January  2021,  she
should be eligible for an income-based payment plan.1 (AE A-E)
Applicant  cosigned  a  car  loan  for  her  mother.  Her  mother  is  making  the
payments,  and  the  loan  is  current.  That  car  loan  is  the  only  non-SOR  debt  with  a
balance  on  Applicant’s  credit  report.  Except  for  what  she  may  have  received  from  the
student  loan  company,  Applicant  has  not  received  financial  counseling.  She  did  not
provide  proof  of  payments  toward  the  medical  debts  and  private  student  loan.  She
indicated that she wants to pay all  of her loans and debts and reach financial stability.

Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
August 2018. She did not report any adverse information under the financial questions.
She  credibly  denied  intentionally  providing  false  information  about  her  finances.  She
stated that she did not think she had to list her student loans, and she was unaware of
her medical debts. (Tr. at 26-27, 43; GE 1)
