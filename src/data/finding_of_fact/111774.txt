Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  February  2018.  He  is  applying  for  a  security  clearance  for
the first time. He has never married, and he has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 36-38,
67-68; GE 1)
Applicant had periods of unemployment and underemployment. He moved to an
area that had more opportunities, and he went to community college to learn a trade. He
then had an apprenticeship. He used credit, but he had difficulty paying his bills. (Tr. at
30-37; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1; AE R)
The SOR alleges ten delinquent debts totaling about $23,750. In his response to
the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  owing  all  the  debts,  except  he  indicated  that  he  paid  the
$413 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g.
Applicant  engaged  the  services  of  a  debt-resolution  company  in  June  2018.  He
enrolled  ten  debts  in  the  company’s  debt-relief  program  (DRP).  It  appears  that  all  but
the  accounts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  were  included  in  the  DRP. He  agreed  to pay  the
company $388 per month. The company negotiates settlements with his creditors, and
pays the settlement amounts out of the accumulated funds, minus their fees. Applicant
did not pay the DRP every month, as he paid other debts some months. Between June
2018 and October 2019, he made nine payments of $388, for a total of $3,492. (Tr. at

In July 2018, the company negotiated a payment plan with the law firm collecting
a  debt  for  a  bank  (SOR  ¶  1.g).  The  bank  obtained  a  $1,815  judgment  against  him  in
August 2018. From July 2018 through September 2019, the company paid the law firm
$1,347. The SOR alleges the debt with a balance of $413, which was based on an April
2019  credit  report.  However,  the  debt  was  larger  before  the  SOR  was  issued.  The
August  2018  credit  report  lists  the  balance  as  $1,322.  The  August  2019  credit  report
lists  the  balance  as  $312.  The  law  firm  accepted  $185  in  September  2019,  as  final
settlement of the debt. (GE 2, 3, 5, 7; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE B, C, J, K, P, Q,
R)
Applicant paid $144 in December 2019 and $146 in January 2020 to resolve the
$275 medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. He also paid other debts outside the DRP. He
paid $313 in September 2019 and $274 in December 2019 to pay two debts that were
not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  He  paid  in  full  two  payday  loans  that  were  not  alleged  in  the
SOR. (Tr. at 36-38, 47-50, 59-61; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 5; AE E, H, I,

In  addition  to  any  advice  he  received  from  the  debt  resolution  company,
Applicant  received  financial  counseling  from  a  company  that  specializes  in  military
customers. His counselor wrote that Applicant “has shown dedication and perseverance
in regards to getting his debt paid off and has continuously updated me on his progress
each time he has successfully paid off one of his loans.” Applicant finally has a good job
with  a  bright  future.  He  knows  that  his  job  is  conditioned  on  him  receiving  and
maintaining a security clearance, and that he could lose his security clearance and job if
he does not  continue to  pay  his delinquent debts.  He  lives  frugally  on a budget.  He  is
current  on  his  student  loan,  which  has  a  workable  balance  of  about  $10,700.  He
credibly stated that he is committed to paying all his debts and to eventually becoming
debt free. (Tr. at 32-33, 40, 51-57, 70-71; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 5; AE
D, F, O, R)
Applicant  submitted  a letter from his supervisor  attesting  to  Applicant’s  superior
job  performance.  The  supervisor  described  Applicant  as  “a  dedicated,  capable,  and
faithful person.” (AE G)
