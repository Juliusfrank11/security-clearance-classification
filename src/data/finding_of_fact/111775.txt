Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact:
Applicant,  33,  has  worked  as  a  tech  specialist  for  a  defense  contractor  since
September 2017. He graduated from high school in June 2004 and enlisted in the U.S.
Marine Corps in September 2005. He served for nine years and held the rank of sergeant
(E-5) at the time of his honorable discharge. He has never deployed to a war zone. He
held a security clearance while in the Marine Corps.
Applicant has been unemployed or under employed from the time of his September
2014  discharge  until  his  current  employment  in  2017.  From  October  2014  through
February 2016, he was a full-time college student and was receiving a stipend under the
Post-9/11 GI Bill. He supplemented his income working as a bouncer in bars. He has not
earned a college degree. He has never married, and he has no children. (Tr. at 24-30.)
Applicant  was  indebted  when  he  was  discharged  from  the  Marine  Corps.
Thereafter,  his  finances  worsened  without  a  regular  paycheck  equal  to  what  he  was
making in the military until he began his current employment. He incurred a number of
additional debts that he has been unable to pay. (Tr. 31-32.)
GUIDELINE F, Financial Considerations
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.i, and 1.j, Three Bank Accounts Charged-Off in the Total Amount of
$12,097 – The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a ($9,802) is for a loan used to purchase a vehicle.
Applicant opened the loan in October 2016. He subsequently defaulted on the loan, and
the vehicle was repossessed. After the resale of the vehicle, Applicant was responsible
for the remaining balance. At one time, the creditor offered to settle the debt for about
$1,400, but Applicant was unable to make any payments. This debt is not resolved. (GE
2 at 6; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 1; GE 5 at 14; Tr. at 34-36.)
The  debts  owed  to  the  same  creditor  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.i  ($1,143)  and  1.j
($1,152) are for an unpaid credit card and an overdrawn bank account. He wrote in his
SOR answer that he had reached an agreement with the bank to settle these debts with
partial  payments  if  made  by  July  19,  2019.  He  credibly  testified  that  he  paid  these
settlements on time. He offered an exhibit, dated July 19, 2019, to show a payment of the
two  debts,  which  are  listed  on  the  exhibit.  These  debts  are  resolved.  (SOR  answer
addendum; AE C; Tr. at 49-53.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.f, Two Education Loans Placed for Collection in the Total Amount
of $7,853. The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b ($6,937) is for a student loan for a course that
Applicant failed and was obligated to repay at that time. The education debt alleged in
SOR ¶ 1.f ($916) is also owed to the same lender. Applicant has not been able to pay
these obligations. These debts are not resolved. (SOR answer at 2; GE 2 at 6-7; GE 3 at
2; Tr. at 36-40.)
SOR ¶ 1.c, Credit Account Placed for Collection in the Amount of $4,419. This debt
is for an unpaid military credit card. Applicant defaulted on this debt in July 2016. A federal
lien  has been  levied  against  him. Payments have  been  made  to the  U.S.  Government
through  the  diversion  of  his  federal  tax  refunds.  Applicant  has  voluntarily  made  some
minor payments on this account, but he has not established a repayment plan. This debt
is not resolved. (GE 2 at 7-8; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 5; Tr. at 40-41.)
SOR  ¶  1.d,  Unpaid  Education  Account  in  the  Amount  of  $3,744.  In  May  2016,
Applicant opened this student loan with a second education lender. The loan is presently
with a collection agency acting on behalf of the Federal Government. He defaulted on the
loan  in  December  2018.  Applicant  attached  to  his  SOR  answer  a  copy  of  a  receipt
reflecting a June 2019 payment on this account in the amount of $150. Applicant testified
that he is “still paying on it regularly.” He tries to pay $50 or $100 on this account every
pay period “as I can.” He asserted that for the last eight months, he has been making
payments at least once a month, but this is uncorroborated. A November 25, 2019 credit
report reflects a balance on this account of $3,685, just $59 less than the original debt
amount. Applicant is trying to pay down this debt, but has not established a payment plan
with the bank and has not provided documentary evidence of an appropriate track record
of payments. This debt is not resolved. (SOR answer at 2; GE 3 at 2; AE A; Tr. at 41-43.)
SOR ¶ 1.e, Unpaid Rent in the Amount of $2,550. This debt is for unpaid rent Applicant
owes to his former landlord. After his September 2014 discharge, when he was no longer
receiving his basic housing allowance, he fell behind on his rent and was evicted in June
2015. The creditor will not work with Applicant to accept a partial payment in settlement
of this debt. He has not made any payments on this account. This debt is not resolved.
(SOR answer; GE 2 at 2, 7; GE 4 at 2; Tr. at 44-45.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h, Unpaid Communication Accounts Placed for Collection in the
Total Amount of $615. Applicant testified that he has paid the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g
($516) in the last couple of years while he was working for his current employer. He points
out that the debt does not appear on his current credit report that he reviewed prior to the
hearing. The debt does not appear on the Government’s two most recent credit reports.
The debt is listed in GE 5, which is dated December 16, 2017. Applicant testified that he
needs to investigate further to establish that this debt is paid. He also believes  he has
paid the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h ($99), but he has no record of the payment. As with
the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g, the smaller debt only appears on the oldest credit report
in the record. The fact that debts are no longer listed on recent credit reports, however,
is not reliable evidence of payment of a debts. Debts are often removed from credit reports
for reasons  other than  payments.  Applicant has  not established that  these debts  have
been paid. These debts are not resolved. (GE 3; GE 4; GE 5 at 4; Tr. at 45-49.)
SOR ¶ 1.k, Unpaid Court Costs and Fine in Amount of $161. Applicant testified that
he first learned about the debt when he received the SOR. He believes this debt is for a
fee related to a substance abuse program he entered as part of the disposition of a Driving
While Intoxicated (DWI) charge discussed below. He claims he was advised that he can
only pay this small debt if he pays his defense attorney $2,000 to resolve it for him. He
claims that the state will not accept a check from him directly because he had counsel in
his criminal case.  Actually,  the  record  evidence  reflects that this debt  is for  a  ticket he
received  on  February  13,  2017,  for  operating  an  unlicensed  motor  vehicle.  He  did  not
appear on the April 12, 2017 trial date and was found guilty in absentia. He was fined $50
and ordered to pay costs of $101, for a total debt of $151. The $10 discrepancy with the
debt amount in the SOR allegation appears to be a typographical error. This debt is not
resolved. (SOR answer at 3-4; GE 6; Tr. at 53-55.)
Applicant wants to resolve his largest debts first. He has no savings and no ability
to pay the unresolved debts. His take-home pay appears to be more than sufficient to
cover  his  basic  living  expenses.  His  rent  is  very  modest.  He  owns  no  motor  vehicles,
except a motorcycle. He cannot explain where he spends all of his income. (Tr. at 56-74.)
Two other incidents have impacted Applicant’s finances. Recently, Applicant was
involved in an incident with another person and a torts claim was made against him for
causing emotional distress. He settled the claim and made some payments to the other
party.  In  March  2018,  Applicant  was  involved  in  a  serious  accident  while  riding  his
motorcycle.  He  was  badly  injured  and  needed  surgery.  He  lost  work  for  an  extended
period of time, though he eventually received disability pay. He also received a settlement
in the gross amount of about $30,000. He  used those funds to pay off the loan on  his
motorcycle  and  to  pay  his  attorney.  After  that  settlement,  he  did  not  seek  financial
counseling to help him return to financial stability. (SOR answer at 4; AE B; Tr. at 56-74.)
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct
SOR ¶¶2.a and 2.b, June 2016 DWI, 1st Offense Conviction and Warrant for Failure
to attend Court-Ordered Alcohol Abuse Classes.
Applicant admits the allegations in SOR ¶ 2.a that in June 2016, he was convicted
of DWI 1st and sentenced in October 2016 to serve five days in jail. The record evidence
reflects  that  the  charge  he  pled  guilty  to  involved  a  blood  alcohol  content,  or  BAC,  of
0.15% to 0.20%. He was also sentenced to 12 months of unsupervised probation and his
driver’s  license  was  restricted  for  limited  use  until  October  2017.  In  addition,  the  court
ordered  Applicant  to  attend  a  state  alcohol  substance  abuse  program  (Program).  He
mistakenly believed that he had fulfilled all of the requirements of that Program in State 1
before  he  moved  to  State  2  to  begin  his  employment  with  his  current  employer  in
September 2017. On July 10, 2017, a charge was filed against him  in State 1 for non-
compliance with the Program. On August 10, 2017, he was tried in absentia in State 1
court  and  found  guilty.  The  court  issued  a  capias  for  his  arrest.  Applicant  has  been
declared to be a fugitive by State 1. (GE 6 at 1-2; GE 7 at 5; GE 8 at 1-2; GE 9 at 1.) As
of the date of the hearing, the warrant remained outstanding.
