In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d,
1.g-1.i,  1.k,  and  1.l.  He  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.e,  1.f,  and  1.j.  His
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  43-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  and  is  currently
deployed overseas. He has been employed by defense contractors since May 2017. He
served on active duty in the U.S. Army from October 1996 to November 2016, when he
retired  as  a  sergeant  first  class  (pay  grade  E-7).  He  held  a  security  clearance  in  the
Army and retained it as an employee of a defense contractor.
Applicant married in June 1996. He and his wife have three daughters, ages 26,
22,  and  21.  He  has  a  13-year-old  son  from  a  relationship  that  occurred  while  he  was
separated from his wife in 2005. He pays child support of $400 per month for his son.
(FORM Item 5 at 2.)
Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in May 2002, listing assets of
$22,506  and  liabilities  of  $20,300.  He  completed  the  payment  plan  and  received  a
discharge  in  October  2005.  (FORM  Item  12.)  This  bankruptcy  was  not  alleged  in  the
SOR.
The SOR alleges four Chapter 13 bankruptcies that he filed between April 2014
and  January  2017  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.d).  The  evidence  concerning  these  bankruptcies  is
summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a. Applicant filed a bankruptcy petition on April 1, 2014, while he was on
active  duty.  (FORM  Item  11.)  He  owned  and  occupied  a  home  near  his  military  duty
station. He was reassigned to another duty station and decided to rent his home. When
his tenants stopped paying their rent, Applicant was unable to pay the mortgage loan on
the home as well as his rent at the new duty station. He stopped making payments on
the  mortgage  loan  in  June  2013,  and  the  lender  initiated  foreclosure  proceedings.
Applicant filed the bankruptcy petition in April 2014 to stop the foreclosure.
When Applicant filed this petition, his monthly pay and allowances were $6,435.
His  wife,  a  joint  debtor,  was  not  employed  outside  the  home.  He  listed  assets  of
$213,859 and liabilities of $296,818. His secured debts were his mortgage loan, home
furniture,  and  two  vehicles.  He  listed  unsecured  debts  totaling  $28,122,  including
$13,975 in student loans.
The petition was dismissed in June 2014. Applicant attributed the dismissal to his
attorney’s  failure  to  timely  file  required  documents.  However,  the  bankruptcy  record
reflects that it was dismissed in response to the trustee’s objection to confirmation of the
payment plan and a motion to dismiss on several grounds, including the following: that
Applicant failed to make payments into the plan; that the plan would extend beyond 60
months;  that  it  failed  to  include  Applicant’s  child-support  obligation  and  his  rental
expense  at  his new  residence;  that  it  provided  for  an  excessive  amount  of  disposable
income  toward  automobile  debt;  and  that  it  proposed  to  retain  his  rental  property  with
negative equity. (FORM Item 11.)
SOR  ¶  1.b.  Applicant  filed  another  bankruptcy  petition  on  July  3,  2014.  In  his
response  to  the  SOR,  he  asserted  that  he  dismissed  this  petition  because  the
bankruptcy  attorney  failed  to  stop  the  foreclosure  process.  However,  the  bankruptcy
record reflects that the bankruptcy was dismissed on motion of the trustee. The trustee
objected  to  the  plan  on  multiple  grounds,  including  the  following:  that  the  plan  as
proposed  would  extend  beyond  60  months;  that  Applicant  had  failed  to  maintain  the
required  payments;  that  the  plan  proposed  to  pay  $29,068  for  two  automobiles,
indicating a lack of good faith by “attempting to refinance an auto purchase through the
Chapter  13  plan”;  and  that  Applicant  proposed  to  retain  non-residential  real  property
“that  only  serves  as  a  drain  on  the  estate.”  The  trustee’s  motion  to  dismiss  the
bankruptcy  was  granted  in  September  2014,  rendering  Applicant  ineligible  to  file
another bankruptcy petition for 180 days. (FORM Item 10.) The foreclosure of the rental
property was completed in July 2015, ten months after this bankruptcy was dismissed.
(FORM Item 14.)
SOR ¶ 1.c. Applicant filed another Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in September
2016,  when  he  was  on  terminal  leave  before  retiring  from  active  duty  in  November
2016. It was dismissed in December 2016 on motion of the trustee for several defects in
the proposed payment plan and for failure to make the payments. (FORM Item 9 at 2,
documents 19 and 23.) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he decided not
to pursue the bankruptcy because he had a job offer to start work in December 2016.
However, his SCA reflects that he was unemployed from November 2016 to May 2017.
(FORM Item 4 at 12.)
SOR  ¶  1.d.  Applicant  filed  another  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  petition  in  January
2017, which was dismissed in April 2017. In his answer to the SOR, he asserted that he
dismissed the petition because he had obtained employment overseas and had begun
earning  sufficient  income  to  address  his  financial  obligations.  The  trustee’s  motion  to
dismiss  cited  Applicant’s  failure  to  make  payments,  pointed  out  that  the  plan  failed  to
provide  for  Applicant’s  monthly  $400  child-support  obligation,  and  pointed  out  that  the
plan proposed to pay $38,617 for four automobiles, indicating a lack of good faith. The
petition  was  dismissed  with  prejudice,  rendering  Applicant  ineligible  to  file  another
petition for 180 days. (FORM Item 9, document 23.)
The SOR also alleges 12 delinquent debts, totaling about $30,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.e-
1.l). The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.e: auto loan charged off for $16,706. This debt arose when Applicant
co-signed  a  loan  for  his  daughter.  (FORM  Item  5  at  4.)  It  was  charged  off  in  January
2019 and was settled in June 2019 for less than the full balance. (FORM Items 6 at 4;
FORM Item 13 at 4.)
SOR ¶ 1.f: auto loan charged off for $4,992. In Applicant’s answer to the SOR,
he  asserted  that  he  had  been  making  monthly  payments  since  2017  on  this  debt  and
that  the  account  was current. The  credit  report from  March  2019  reflects that  the debt
was  charged  off  for  $10,554  in  January  2017,  that  the  debt  was  disputed,  and  that  a
reinvestigation  was  in  process.  (FORM  Item  6  at  4.)  The  reduction  in  the  amount
charged off supports Applicant’s assertion that he had been making payments. The debt
is not reflected in the September 2019  credit report and is too recent to have aged off
his  credit  record  under  the  Fair  Credit  Reporting  Act,  indicating  that  the  dispute  was
resolved in Applicant’s favor. (FORM Item 13.)
SOR ¶ 1.g: line of credit charged off for $1,522. This debt was included in the
July  2014  and  January  2017  bankruptcies.  (FORM  Items  8  and  10.)  In  Applicant’s
answer to the SOR, he asserted that a law firm was assisting him in resolving the debt.
It is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.h: installment sales contract for furniture, placed for collection of
$1,204.  Applicant  stopped  making  payments  on  this  debt  in  August  2016,  and  it  was
included  in  the  January  2017  bankruptcy.  (FORM  Item 8.) The  September  2019  credit
report reflects that the debt is charged off. (FORM Item 13.) In Applicant’s answer to the
SOR,  he  asserted  that  a  law  firm  was  assisting  him  in  resolving  this  debt.  It  is  not
resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.i:  credit-union  debt,  placed  for  collection  of  $428.  This  debt  was
included  in  the  January  2017  bankruptcy.  (FORM  Item 8.)  The  September  2019  credit
report reflects that the debt is unpaid. (FORM Item 13 at 2.) In Applicant’s answer to the
SOR,  he  asserted  that  a  law  firm  was  assisting  him  in  resolving  this  debt.  It  is  not
resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.j:  military  credit-card  account  past  due  for  $106.  The  September
2019 credit report reflects that this account is current. (FORM Item 13 at 2.)
SOR ¶ 1.k: cellphone account placed for collection of $3,683. In Applicant’s
answer  to  the  SOR,  he  stated  that  his  monthly  service  bill  with  his  cellphone  provider
was  current,  but  that  this  debt  is  for  six  cellphones  that  the  provider  refused  to  take
back. This account was referred for collection after Applicant’s last bankruptcy was filed
and dismissed. The March 2019 credit report reflects that this debt is disputed. (FORM
Item  6  at  9.)  The  debt  is  not  reflected  in  the  September  2019  credit  report  and  is  too
recent to have aged off his credit record under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, indicating
that the dispute was resolved in Applicant’s favor. (FORM Item 13.).
SOR ¶ 1.l: credit-union debt, placed for collection of $428. This debt appears
to be a duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i.
