Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 71 years old,
married, and he has one stepchild and three children, all adults. (Items 2, 3, 4)
Applicant  graduated from high  school in  1968.  He  served  honorably  in  the  U.S.
military  from  1970  to  1991.  As  of  his  2017  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  he
worked as a pier riser/cable technician for a DOD contractor since November 2016. He
worked for a previous DOD contractor in the same capacity from 2005 to 2016. He was
first granted a DOD security clearance in 1972. (Items 3, 4)
The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely pay his federal income taxes for
tax years 2014 through 2016. It also alleges that he is indebted to the U.S. Government
for  $38,244  in  unpaid  federal  income  taxes  for  tax  years  2005,  2009,  2010,  and  2013
through  2016,  as  well  as  incurring  two  federal  tax  liens  in  the  amounts  of  $9,808  and
$5,868 entered against him in June 2009 and January 2013, respectively. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-
1.d).  The  SOR  and  amended  SOR  also  allege  that  he  has  an  $823  delinquent
consumer debt and five delinquent medical debts totaling $2,773 (SOR ¶¶ 1.e-1.j).
In  addition  to  his  admissions  in  his  Answer,  Applicant  listed  in  his  SCA  that  he
failed  to  file  and  pay  his  2014  through  2016  federal  income  returns  and  taxes,  in  the
amounts  of  $3,192,  $10,388,  and  $6,560,  respectively.  He  further  discussed  his
financial  issues,  to  include  his  delinquent  federal  income  taxes  of  $38,244  and  his
federal tax liens totaling $15,676, during his October 2015 and August 2018 interviews
with a background investigator and in his July 2019 response to interrogatories. His tax
liens and his medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j are reported on his 2015 credit
bureau  report.  His  tax  liens,  his  consumer  debt,  and  all  of  his  medical  debts  are
reported on his 2018 credit bureau report. (Items 1-6)
Applicant  attributed  his  tax  liens,  in  his  2015  background  interview,  to  his  wife
losing money in her 401(k) retirement account in tax year 2000, his withdrawal of money
from his 401(k) retirement account in tax year 2001, and their failure to pay the correct
amount of federal income taxes for tax periods 2000 and 2001. He stated that after the
IRS informed them of their resultant tax indebtedness, they worked with a tax attorney
and reached a payment plan with the IRS of $250 monthly to resolve his liens, which he
paid from 2005 to January 2015. He stated that he contacted the IRS in 2015 because
he was not employed full time, and the collection of his liens were consequently placed
on hold. (Item 4)
Applicant  attributed  his  delinquent  federal  income  taxes  for  tax  periods  2014
through  2016,  in  his  2018  background  interview,  to  his  tax  preparer’s  failure  to  file,
unbeknownst to him and his wife, their joint federal income tax returns for those years.
He also stated that their tax preparer told them that they did not owe any federal income
taxes  for  those  years.  He  stated  that  he  first  learned  about  his  predicament  in
approximately  2017,  when  the  IRS  mailed  him  and  his  wife  correspondence  informing
them about their federal tax indebtedness for tax periods 2014 through 2016. He stated
that  when  he  and  his  wife  were  set  to  begin  paying  their  delinquent  taxes  for  those
years,  they  received  another  letter  from  the  IRS  in  around  mid-2017  stating  that  their
taxes  were  not  in  collection,  though  they  were  still  responsible  for  paying  them.  He
further stated that the IRS told them not to begin repaying their delinquent federal taxes
until they were told to do so, and they had not since heard from the IRS. He stated in his
2019  response  to  interrogatories  that  he  was  in  a  payment  plan  with  the  IRS  of  $265
monthly. (Items 3, 4)
Applicant  attributed  his  delinquent  medical  debts,  in  his  2015  background
interview,  to  a  2012  surgery.  He  stated  that  he  would  contact  his  medical  creditors  to
verify the debts and make efforts to resolve them. In his 2018 background interview, he
stated that he was unaware of his delinquent consumer and medical debts, as his wife
handled their finances, but he would look into and pay them if they were valid. (Items 3,
4)
IRS  documentation  from  August  2017  reflects  that  Applicant  and  his  wife  owe
$38,244  in  federal  taxes  for  tax  years  2005,  2009,  2010,  and  2013  through  2016.  It
reflects that the IRS “temporarily closed [their] collection case” after determining that it
was “currently not collectible” and Applicant could not “pay the money [he] owe[d] at this
time.”  However,  it  also  reflects  that  Applicant  still  owed  the  amount,  which  included
penalty and interest calculated to September 1, 2017, and that the IRS would continue
to charge penalties and interest until he paid the amount owed in full. It also reflects that
the IRS would file a federal tax lien to protect the U.S. Government’s interest, and that
the  IRS  “may  re-open  [his]  case  and  resume  collection  activities  in  the  future  if  [his]
financial situation improves.” (Item 4)
Applicant  stated  in his  2015  background  interview  that he  had not received  any
financial counseling or engaged any debt consolidation services. In his 2019 response
to  interrogatories,  he stated  that  he  was  working  with  a  tax  attorney  to  resolve  his tax
issues. (Item 4)
