Applicant is 51 years old. He has been married since 1993, and has a 24-year-old
son and a teenage daughter. In 1990, he received a diploma after attending a two-year
technical program. He has worked as an electrical and electronics mechanic for a defense
contractor since August 2002. This is his second security clearance application. (Item 3;
Item 4)
The SOR alleges four consumer debts totaling $21,448 and $17,500 in outstanding
federal  income  taxes.  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  all  five  of  the
allegations  without  explanation.  According  to  Applicant,  his  financial  issues  were  the
result of car repairs for a vehicle, paying for his son’s college education, a 2018 reduction
in  income,  and  co-signing  an  automobile  loan  for  his  son,  who  subsequently  failed  to
make the payments. (Item 2; Item 3; Item 4)
During  his  September  2018  personal  subject  interview,  Applicant  told  the
government investigator that the alleged $1,752 credit-card debt was incurred to pay for
vehicle repairs. In approximately June 2015, he fell behind on the payments and paid less
than  the  required  monthly  minimum  payment.  The  account  was  ultimately  placed  for
collection and charged off. Although Applicant told the investigator that he would contact
the  creditor  to  resolve  the  debt  by  December  2018,  the  debt  remains  outstanding  and
unpaid. (Item 3 at 31-32; Item 4 at 6; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 8)
Applicant purchased a vehicle in August 2015 for $15,787. In November 2016, he
fell behind on the payments because he was providing financial support to his son who
was in college. The vehicle was repossessed in August 2017 and sold at auction. The
outstanding  balance  for  the  vehicle  is  $5,758,  which  remains  unpaid  and  unresolved.
(Item 4 at 6; Item 5 at 2-3; Item 6 at 9)
According to Applicant, he closed his cellular-phone account with Company A in
September 2016 and paid the bill in full. Company A sent an additional bill to him for $193,
which he failed to pay. He told the investigator that he would resolve the debt shortly after
the September 2018 interview. This debt does not appear in his most recent credit report;
however,  he  provided  no  documentation  to  show  that  the  debt  has  been  paid  and
resolved. (Item 4 at 7; Item 6 at 8)
In December 2016, Applicant co-signed an automobile loan for his son’s vehicle.
In April 2017, his son fell behind on the monthly loan payments. Applicant sent his son
money to help him catch up on the payments, but the vehicle was ultimately repossessed.
The outstanding balance is $13,745, and it remains unpaid and unresolved. (Item 4 at 6-
7; Item 5 at 1-2; Item 6 at 8)
In  his  response  to  DOHA  interrogatories,  Applicant  included  Internal  Revenue
Service (IRS) transcripts for tax years 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Applicant filed
the returns for his federal income taxes in a timely manner. However, he failed to have
enough money withheld from his paychecks and accrued tax debts for tax years 2013,
2015, 2016, and 2017, the remaining balance totals over $17,500. (Item 4 at 7, 12-39)
Starting  in  April  2014,  Applicant  entered  into  various  installment-payment
agreements  with  the  IRS.  According  to  Applicant,  he  failed  to  comply  with  these
agreements due, in part, to a reduction in his income in 2017. In 2013 Applicant’s adjusted
gross income (AGI) was almost $130,000; his 2014 AGI was almost $133,000; his 2015
AGI was almost $143,000; his 2016 AGI was almost $160,000; and his 2017 AGI was
$133,550. In May 2019, he entered into a new installment agreement for the four relevant
tax  years.  However,  he  did  not  provide  proof  of  ongoing  and  continuing  payments
pursuant to the May 2019 installment agreement. There is no evidence in the record that
Applicant has obtained credit counseling. (Item 2; Item 4 at 7, 12-39)
