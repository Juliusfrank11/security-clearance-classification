Applicant  is  a  60-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance.  (Tr.  5)  She  is  employed  as  an  engineering  support  specialist  for  a  large
company  in  the  defense  industry.  She  has  worked  for  this  company  since  2016.  She
has a good employment record and is considered an outstanding employee. (Exhibit E;
Tr.  40-48)  She  married  in  1986  and  divorced  in  1999.  She  has  an  adult  son  from  the
marriage, and she is a grandmother.
The  SOR  concerns  a  history  of  income-tax  problems  as  follows:  (1)  failure  to
timely  file  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2009-2015,  and  2018;  (2) failure  to
timely  file  state  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2009-2015,  and  2018;  (3)  back  taxes
owed to the IRS in the amount of $3,286 for tax year 2018; and (4) back taxes owed to
the state tax authority in the amount of $520 for 2018. Applicant disclosed her income-
tax  problems  when  she  completed  her  2016  security  clearance  application,  and  she
provided additional information during the security clearance process. (Exhibits 1 and 2)
Applicant attributed her income-tax problems to her excessive use of alcohol. (Tr.
57) She dates her sobriety to November 17, 2009. (Tr. 59) She explained that although
she had sufficient funds withheld for taxes, she fell behind in filing tax returns because
she  was  focused  on  maintaining  her  sobriety,  one  day  at  a  time.  (Tr.  57-58)  She
described her tax problems as the “wreckage” of her past. (Tr. 58) She put off the tax
matters until she was at a point in her sobriety where she was able to handle the issue
and then focused on cleaning up the “wreckage” of her past. (Tr. 58)
Applicant  is  now  in  compliance  with  both  federal  and  state  tax  authorities.
(Exhibits  2,  A,  B,  C,  D,  F,  G,  and  I)  She  made  contact  with  an  accountant  in  late
February 2017 and filed federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014,
2015, and 2016. (Exhibit G) She repeated the process the following year for tax years
2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2017. (Exhibit G)  Going forward, she intends to continue
using the services of the accountant.
A review of the federal tax returns shows that Applicant was due a refund for tax
years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016,  and 2017. (Exhibit 2) She owed the
IRS $528 for tax year 2015, which she paid. Likewise, a review of the state income tax
returns  shows  that  Applicant  was  due  a  refund  for  tax  years  2009,  2010,  2013,  2015,
2016, and 2017. (Exhibit 2)
For  the  most  recent  tax  year  of  2018,  Applicant  obtained  an  extension  of  time
until October 15, 2019, to file her federal tax return, and it was timely filed on June 26,
2019. (Exhibit A -- 2018 IRS Account Transcript) She filed her state income tax return
the same day. (Exhibit 2) She owed $3,286 for her federal return, and she owed $506
for her state return. (Exhibit 2)
Applicant  has  paid  all  monies  due  the  IRS.  The  following  month  after  filing  the
2018 returns, she entered into a short-term payment plan with the IRS agreeing to pay
$3,524  within  the  next  120  days,  no  later  than  November  28,  2019.  (Exhibit  B)  She
made  at  least  three  payments  during  September  and  October  2019,  and  her  account
balance for tax year 2018 is now $0. (Exhibit I)
Likewise, Applicant paid all monies due the state tax authority during the course
of 2019. (Exhibits C and D) She owed a total of approximately $778 for tax years 2010,
2011, 2012, and 2018. The state tax authority certified, in a document dated December
11, 2019, that she has filed all  returns and paid all taxes due, and that she is in good
standing. (Exhibit F)
Her  overall  financial  situation  appears  to  be  stable  based  on  a  review  of  credit
reports from  2019.  (Exhibits  3  and  H)  Both  are  “clean”  reports  in  that  neither  contains
derogatory  information.  For  example,  a  December  2019  credit  report  discloses  13
accounts, all of which are described as current with $0 past due, and five accounts have
balances of $0. (Exhibit H)
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.6
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,

unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;
AG ¶ 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local
income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income
tax as required; and
AG ¶ 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax
authority  to  file  or  pay  the  amount  owed  and  is  in  compliance  with  those
arrangements.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.  The
disqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.
Applicant  made  great  progress  in  resolving  the  income-tax  matters,  and  she  is
now in compliance with both federal and state tax authorities. That means she filed all
tax  returns,  as  required;  she  paid  all  taxes  due  to  the  state  tax  authority,  as  required;
and she paid all taxes due to the IRS, as required. And she did a good job documenting
her compliance.
In addressing this issue, I note that an applicant’s failure to timely file tax returns
and pay tax when due bears close examination and is a matter of serious concern to the
federal government. The DOHA Appeal Board has made it clear that an applicant who
fails repeatedly to fulfill their legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying tax
when  due,  does  not  demonstrate  the  high  degree  of  good  judgment  and  reliability
required  of  those  granted  access  to  classified  information.  See  ISCR  Case  No.  15-
06707 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2017).
Here, I am concerned about the duration of Applicant’s income-tax problems and
the  timing  of  her  remedial  action.  Both  are  questions  of  fact  that  must  be  addressed.
Applicant failed  to  timely  file  state  and federal  income  tax  returns for  seven  tax  years,
2009  through  2015.  Payment  of  tax  was  a  minor  problem  compared  with  the  multiple
years of failure to file. She did so, as she explained during the hearing, due to her focus
on maintaining her sobriety and waiting to reach a point where she was able to handle
the tax matters.
To her credit, Applicant disclosed her income-tax problems in her 2016 security
clearance  application,  and  she  provided  additional  information  during  the  security
clearance process. She began taking remedial action in 2017, well before the SOR was
issued,  by  retaining  the  services  of  an  accountant  and  filing  several  years  of  returns.
She repeated the process the following year when she filed the remaining outstanding
returns. She has timely filed returns for the last three tax years, 2016-2018. She paid all
back taxes (less than $5,000 in total) during the course of 2019. Recent credit reports
show  she  is  a  responsible  user  of  credit  and  not  financially  overextended.  She  has  a
good employment record and is considered an outstanding employee.
Ordinarily,  I  am  not  inclined  to  make  a  favorable  decision  in  a  case  involving
multiple  years  of  failure  to  file  income  tax  returns.  But  I  am  persuaded  this  case  is
different due to Applicant’s explanation for why she incurred the tax problems, which I
found  persuasive  and  worthy  of  belief.  I  am  persuaded  that  Applicant  has  reached  a
point in her sobriety  where compliance with federal and state tax laws  is no longer an
issue for her. This is evidenced by  her timely  filing  of  tax  returns for the  last  three  tax
years (2016-2018), and her ability and willingness to pay back taxes in a relatively short
period of time. Accordingly, the mitigating condition at AG ¶ 20(g) applies. The evidence
is  sufficient  to  justify  mitigation  of  her  history  of  noncompliance  with  her  federal  and
state income tax obligations.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent  standard,  I  have  no  doubts  or
concerns  about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to
protect  classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the
evidence  as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the
unfavorable  evidence  or  vice  versa.  I  also  considered  the  whole-person  concept.  I
conclude  that  she  has  met  her  ultimate  burden  of persuasion  to  show  that  it  is clearly
consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  her  eligibility  for  access  to  classified
information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:
For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a -- 1.d:
For Applicant
Conclusion
It  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for
access to classified information. Eligibility granted.
