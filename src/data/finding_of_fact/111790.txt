In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c
through  1.k,  and  1.m.  He  also  provided  extenuating  and  mitigating  information.  His
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 53-year-old senior systems analyst who has worked for the same
employer since January 2007. (Item 3) In 1984, he graduated from high school. (Id.) He
has no military service. (Id.) In 1984, he married, and his five children were born in 1984,
1985, 1987, 1992, and 2000. (Id.)
Financial Considerations
In  December  1999,  Applicant  was  having  financial  problems,  and  he  filed  for
bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. (Item 5) The bankruptcy enabled
him to develop a plan under the bankruptcy court’s supervision to repay all or part of his
debts. In March 2006, his unsecured nonpriority debts were discharged under Chapter
13.  (Item  5)  He  received  financial  counseling  as  part  of  the  bankruptcy  process.  This
bankruptcy was not listed on his SOR.
Applicant’s  December  28,  2018  SCA  shows  no  periods  of  unemployment  after
2007. (Item 3) He also disclosed several financial issues in his SCA. (Id.) He said:
Two and [a] half to three years ago we took on full financial responsibility of
two grandkids unexpectedly. The burden has taken a toll on us financially.
We tried to work with our creditors but none of them were willing to work
with us. The everyday burden of our normal lives, which included our own
16 year old son and helping to put our 4th son through college, was a tight
squeeze, but we were managing it. When we took on a then [three to four]
year old  and  a  then  [six  to  seven]  year old,  it  just  broke  the bubble.  As I
stated, we tried to work with our creditors, but none were willing to budge.
It was an option of feed/support our new growing responsibility and let our
finances  suffer  .  .  .  or  not  take  care  of  the  family.  We  are  still  in  full
custody/care of the grand kids and our youngest son is a senior ready to
head off to college.
(Id.  at  33)  He  listed  delinquent  debts  on  his  SCA  as  follows:  $1,267;  $6,642;  $7,562;
$3,269;  $1,167;  $1,060;  $427;  $779;  $8,184;  $4,976;  and  $3,255.  (Id.  at  32-43)  In
response to the question on his SCA about actions to resolve debts, he said that he was
working to file bankruptcy. (Id.)
The SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts totaling $32,035, as follows: 1.a ($427); 1.b
($28); 1.c ($3,269); 1.d ($1,060); 1.e ($4,976); 1.f ($6,699); 1.g ($1,167); 1.h ($1,267); 1.i
($3,255); 1.j ($799); 1.k ($1,136); 1.l ($390); and 1.m ($7,562). (Item 1) The support for
the  SOR  allegations  is  found  in  Applicant’s  credit  report  and  Officer  of  Personnel
Management personal subject interview. (Items 4, 6)
In his August 13, 2019 SOR response, Applicant said he did not recognize the debt
in SOR ¶ 1.b for $28. (Item 2) He said he was paying the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h for $1,267.
(Id.)  He thought the debts in SOR ¶ 1.a for $427 and 1.l for $390 were the same debt, as
they both originated from the same bank. (Id.) He explained that his spouse was unable
to work outside their home because she needed to care for their two grandchildren. (Id.)
Part of their financial pressure resulted from their efforts to fund their fourth child’s college
education. (Id.) He reiterated his plan was to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the
Bankruptcy Code; however, he had not yet discussed this plan with an attorney. (Id.) He
indicated that he enjoyed providing support to service members and wished to do so in
the  future.  (Id.)  He  is  dedicated  to  providing  that  support  and  wanted  to  give  service
members “the best service possible.” (Id.)
In  the  FORM,  Department  Counsel  noted  the  absence  of  corroborating  or
supporting  documentation  of  resolution  of  the  SOR  debts.  Aside  from  Applicant’s
uncorroborated  statements,  there  is  no  documentary  evidence  that  Applicant  paid,
arranged to pay, settled, compromised, or otherwise resolved any of the SOR debts. The
FORM informed Applicant that he had 30 days from the receipt of the FORM “in which to
submit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation,
or explanation, as appropriate. If you do not file any objections or submit any additional
information . . . your case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination
based solely” on the evidence set forth in this FORM. (FORM at 4) He did not respond to
the FORM.
