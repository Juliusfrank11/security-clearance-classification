In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  admitted  and  denied  with  clarification  the
allegations in SOR ¶ 1.a.; he admitted with clarification the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c,
1.f, 1.g, and 1.h; and he admitted in part and denied in part the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d,
and 1.e. (HE 3) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 42-year-old senior cloud engineer. (Tr. 14-15, 17; AE G; GE 1) He
has 20 years of experience as an information technology specialist. (AE G) He attended
college for several years; however, he did not receive a degree. (GE 1; AE G) He received
numerous information technology certifications. (AE G) He has never served in the U.S.
military. (GE 1) He was married from 2002 to 2016, and he has two children who are ages
15 and 23. (Tr. 14; GE 1; AE F)
Financial Considerations
The SOR contains the following financial allegations:
SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.g, allege that Applicant failed to timely file his federal income
tax returns for tax years 2010, and 2013 through 2018. They allege he has delinquent
federal income taxes as follows: 2010 ($5,830); 2013 ($5,278); 2014 ($15,701); and 2017
($6,451). SOR ¶ 1.h alleges that Applicant filed to timely file his state income tax returns
for  tax  years  2010  through  2018,  and  he  owes  the  state  $18,361  for  delinquent  state
taxes.
Before his marital difficulties, Applicant timely filed his tax returns. (Tr. 16, 62; SOR
response at 3) He said his spouse left him in 2010, and he was required to pay $1,900
monthly for child support during the divorce proceedings. (Tr. 16; SOR response at 3) He
was also required to pay the mortgage on the family residence. (Id.) When his divorce
was finalized, his monthly child support was set at $2,139, and he was required to pay
his  children’s  medical  expenses  and  some  other  expenses.  (AE  E)  He  unsuccessfully
attempted  to  obtain  a  reduction  in  his  child  support  payment  from  the  court.  (SOR
response at 3) Beginning in May 2016, he had $2,674 automatically garnished from his
paycheck  for  child  support,  which  included  payment  for  an  arrearage.  (Tr.  20;  SOR
response at 3; AE F) He had to pay attorney fees for his divorce. (Tr. 45)
In  his  SOR  response,  Applicant  said  due  to  stress,  he  “forgot  that  he  had  an
obligation to file his income taxes.” (HE 3 at 3) His former spouse took their children with
her when she left, and he was upset. (Tr. 17) Some of the delay in the filing of his tax
returns was caused by the necessity to obtain needed documentation that was in storage
and on his accountants’ or tax preparers’ failures to correctly or expeditiously file his tax
returns.  (Tr.  49,  50-52;  AE  P)  He  subsequently  filed  all  necessary  tax  returns.  (SOR
response at 3) During his September 13, 2017 Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
personal  subject  interview  (PSI),  Applicant  said  he  did  not  timely  file  his  tax  returns
because he did not want to pay the government. (GE 2 at 14)
Applicant has lived with his parents since 2010 to assist with their medical care
and their finances. (SOR response; AE V) In 2010, his mother was diagnosed with breast
cancer.  (AE  V)  In  2012,  his  mother  was  diagnosed  with  a  gallbladder  illness  which
required  surgery,  and  in  2015,  his  mother  was  diagnosed  with  cardiovascular  disease
and a blood clot on her lungs. (AE V) In 2018, his mother was diagnosed with chronic
gastric inflammation, and she retired from her DOD employment because of her illness.
(AE V) In 2015, his father was diagnosed with kidney and prostate cancer, which required
surgery in 2016.  (AE V) In September 2019, his father was diagnosed with congested
heart  failure,  and  is  currently  under  treatment.  (AE  V)  His  father  is  or  was  an  owner-
operator  truck  driver  with  no  medical  benefits,  and  when  he  took  time  off  to  help  his
spouse during her illness, the family lost income. (SOR response) Applicant assisted with
payment of medical bills and cared for his parents. (AE V)
Applicant filed his state income tax returns at about the same time as his federal
income tax returns. (Tr. 34, 38, 40, 43, 53, 56-60) He provided the following information
regarding the timeliness of filing his federal and state tax returns.

During  Applicant’s  OPM  PSI  on  November  1,  2018,  Applicant  was  questioned
about his delinquent tax debt and failure to file tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016.
(GE  2  at  18)  He  said  he  would  file  the  tax  returns  “this  month.”  (Id.)  He  filed  them  on
November 25, 2019. (AE T)
From 2010 to present, Applicant’s annual income was from $97,000 to $200,000.
(Tr. 28) He established an IRS installment payment agreement on November 12, 2015.
(AE  A  at  4)  On  June  12,  2017,  the  IRS  said  Applicant  was  no  longer  in  installment
payment agreement status and initiated a levy. (Tr. 44; AE A at 5) In 2018 and 2019, the
IRS  erroneously  credited  him  with  several  payments  for  tax  year  2015,  and  then
transferred the payments to tax year 2010.  (Compare AE A at 1 with AE A at 6-7) On
June 21, 2018, the IRS wrote Applicant about not filing his tax return for tax year tax 2016.
(AE A at 8) On November 15, 2018, the IRS wrote Applicant about not filing his tax return
for tax year 2017. (AE A at 9) From June 2017, to 2019, Applicant did not have an IRS-
approved payment plan. (Tr. 45)
On August 3, 2019, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories. (GE 2) He said
he owed $31,429 in federal income taxes as follows: 2010 ($5,865); 2013 ($5,273); 2014
($15,686);  and  2017  ($4,605).  (GE  2  at  2-3)  On  November  15,  2019,  Applicant
established an IRS installment payment plan for tax year 2019. (AE A at 9) From October
2019, to June 2020, he made nine $250 payments to the IRS. (AE C) His current IRS
payment plan is to pay the IRS $472 monthly. (Tr. 19-20; AE B) On June 22, 2020, he
paid the IRS $5,050, and his federal income tax debt for tax year 2010 was paid. (Tr. 19;
AE J at 5, 8) As of the date of his response to the SOR and his hearing, his IRS and state
payment plans were current. (Tr. 23; SOR response) He said he would provide copies of
the tax returns filed in August 2019 after his hearing. (Tr. 52) He did not know how much
he owed the IRS for tax years 2015 and 2016. (Tr. 57) On August 7, 2020, he paid the
IRS $6,748, and he said it was to address his tax debt for tax year 2018; however, in his
response to interrogatories, he said his tax debt for tax year 2018 was zero. (GE 2 at 3;
AE S; Exhibit Cover Sheet) His IRS tax transcript for tax year 2018 shows he received a
$105 refund which was transferred to address his tax debt for tax year 2010. (GE 3 at 11)
He may have meant that his $6,748 payment was to address his federal tax debt for tax
year 2017.
On April 28, 2014, Applicant paid his state tax debt for tax year 2011. (AE Q at 1)
On August 21, 2014, he paid his state tax debt for tax year 2012. (AE Q at 1) From June
2017, to May 2018, he made monthly payments to the state tax authority from $200 to
$250, and he paid his state tax debt for tax year 2013. (AE Q at 1-2) On May 22, 2018,
he owed the state tax authority $14,582 for tax year 2014. (AE Q at 2)
From May 2018,  to July 2019, he made monthly payments to the state tax  authority
from $200 to $250, and  he reduced his state tax  debt for  tax  year 2014 to $13,162. (AE
Q at 2-3)  He estimated he owed the state tax authority $1,500 for tax year 2019. (Tr. 60-
61) From  June  2, 2018, to  January 31,  2020, Applicant made 18 payments to  the state
tax  authority totaling $3,945. (Tr. 21; AE  C; AE  I)  He  missed payments in  March 2019 and
September  2019,  and   he  made  two  payments  in   December  2019.  (AE  C;  AE   I)   The
missed payments  were  due   to   a miscommunication between Applicant’s  bank  and   the
state  tax   authority.  (Tr.   46)   At  the  time  the  SOR  was  issued,  he  owed  the  following
amounts to  the state  tax  authority for  specific tax  years: $2,042 (2013); $9,195 (2014);
$2,281 (2017);  and $624 (2018). (Tr. 42-44, 59-60; GE  2  at 4,  28)  On  December 11, 2019,
the  state  tax   authority  and   Applicant  agreed  to  a  $250  monthly  payment  plan.  (AE  U)
From  January  to  July  2020,  he  made  seven  $250  monthly  payments  to  the   state  tax
authority. (AE U)  At his hearing, he said  he was current on his state tax  payment plan.
(Tr. 24)  His balance  for tax  years 2010 through 2013 was zero. (Tr. 37-39,  43)  He  did not
know how much he owed the state tax authority for tax years 2015 and 2016. (Tr. 57)
In August 2020, he paid the state tax authority $7,501 for the following tax years:
$3,453 (2015);  $3,230 (2017);  and $818 (2018).  (AE R;  AE U)  As of  August  2020,  he
owed the state tax authority $11,561. (AE U)
Applicant provided a personal financial statement indicating as follows: his monthly
gross salary and other income was $13,031; his monthly expenses were $2,510 (includes
child support of $1,975); his monthly debt payment was $1,622 (includes federal income
tax  payment  of  $475,  but  did  not  include  payment  to  the  state  tax  authority);  and  his
monthly  remainder  was  $2,282.  (AE  K)  He  received  financial  counseling  in  December
2019. (AE D)
After receipt of the SOR, Applicant received an offer of employment with a starting
salary of $170,000. (AE M) In March 2020, Applicant started receiving an annual salary
of $170,000. (Tr. 17, 25, 30) His monthly remainder probably increased from $2,282 after
he started his new employment in March 2020. (Tr. 31)
In  2016,  Applicant  went  to  Cuba  for  10  days.  (Tr.  33)  In  2017,  he  traveled  to
Mexico, and in 2017, Applicant and his then girlfriend traveled to Morocco. (Tr. 33; GE 2
at 17) In August 2018, Applicant and a friend traveled to Jamaica and stayed at a resort.
(Id.)  He  did  not  provide  the  amounts  he  spent  for  his  overseas  trips  or  the  amount  of
money that he provided to support his parents.
