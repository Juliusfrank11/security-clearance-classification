expects to receive a master’s degree in cyber security in June 2020. She enlisted in the
U.S. Army Reserve in 1999 and served on active duty in the Army from February 2005
until August 2006. Applicant then served in the Air Force Reserve from 2007 until 2008,
and in the Air National Guard from 2010 to 2011. She received honorable discharges for
all  of  her  various  periods  of  service.  She  has  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  as  a
knowledge  management  and  information  technology  specialist  since  September  2017.

The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  fourteen  delinquent  debts  totaling  almost
$71,000. Additionally, the SOR alleges that she failed to file her 2016 state and federal
income tax returns in a timely manner, as required by law.  Applicant’s financial issues
started  in  approximately  2006  after  she  left  active  duty.  She  was  not  intentionally
negligent  toward  her  financial  responsibilities;  however,  various  life  circumstances
contributed to her inability to pay her obligations.
Applicant  has  worked  for  federal  contracting  companies  on  and  off  since  2007;
however, she has experienced various periods of unemployment and underemployment.
When her son was born in 2006, Applicant was unemployed. She relied on his father for
financial support during that 9-month period of unemployment as well as other periods of
unemployment. Since leaving the abusive relationship with the child’s father in 2015, she
has  received  child  support  on  an  inconsistent  basis.  She  has  also  incurred  significant
legal  fees  contesting  her  son’s  father’s  petitions  for  reductions  of  his  child  support
obligations.  Over  the  years,  Applicant  has  also  provided  financial  help  to  her  mother
during  significant  financial  events.  Applicant  served  as  her  mother’s  caregiver  as  she
battled  cancer  in  2012  and  during  another  health  crisis  in  2014.  Applicant  has  also
experienced her own health issues that have negatively impacted her finances. (GE 1;

The majority of Applicant’s debt consist of 11 student loans, which currently total
approximately $50,000. The loans were opened between 1999 and 2014. She fell behind
on  the  older  student  loan  accounts  in approximately  August  2006,  after she  left  active
duty. At that time, she was unemployed and pregnant. She made periodic payments, but
also deferred the loans and put them in forbearance status. Once the forbearance and
deferments expired, Applicant struggled to make regular payments. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3
at 7-8; AE A; AE B; AE J; AE K; AE L; Tr. 41-44, 47)
Applicant provided documentation demonstrating that she has been rehabilitating
her loans which are currently being administered by a third-party company. She has been
making $24 monthly payments, as required, since July 2019. In March 2020, the accounts
will be reevaluated, and then she will make payments to the Department of Education.
Her 2015 and 2016 federal tax return refunds were seized and applied to her student loan
debt. Since April 2016, payments totaling over $14,282 have been made toward this debt.
Applicant is using her GI Bill benefits to pay for her master’s program and is not incurring
new student loan debt. (AE A; AE B; AE J; Tr. 44-50)
In 2016, Applicant purchased a used vehicle for $10,499 with a 24% interest rate.
Within months it suffered several mechanical issues, and she could not afford both the
car payments and repair costs. Additionally, from June to September 2017, she was on
short-term  disability  due  to  her  thyroid  surgery.  In  July  2018,  Applicant’s  vehicle  was
repossessed,  and  the  $13,315  balance  was  placed  for  collection.  Applicant  started
contacting the lender in June 2019, and settled and resolved this debt in October 2019
with a payment of $5,100. (GE 4 at 5; AE A; AE D; AE J at 5; AE M; Tr. 24-25, 52-54)
During the summer of 2019, Applicant agreed to settle the alleged $440 utility bill.
She made payments in July, August and September 2019 totaling over $110. She made
an additional payment of $25 in November 2019. This debt will be resolved in February
2020. (GE 2; GE 3 at 9; AE A; AE E; AE G at 8; AE J at 6; AE Z; Tr. 55-58)
Applicant denied the alleged $100 medical debt because she did not recognize the
debt. After the issuance of the SOR, she contacted the creditor and learned it is legitimate,
and it was incurred in 2013. She contacted the creditor prior to the hearing and was told
that due to the age of the debt the creditor had closed out the debt. She then disputed
the debt with the three credit reporting companies. (GE 2; GE 3 at 9; GE 4; AE A; AE F;
AE G; AE Q; Tr. 25-26, 58-61)
Applicant  used  a  professional  tax  preparer  for  tax  years  2015  through  2018.  In
2017, Applicant believed that the tax preparer that she had used for previous tax years
had  submitted  her  2016  state  and  federal  income  taxes  in  a  timely  manner.  The  tax
preparer, who was elderly, did not mail Applicant’s 2016 taxes. In August 2019, Applicant
and her preparer filed her state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2016 through
2018.  She  had  previously  filed  for  extensions  for  tax  years  2017  and  2018.  Applicant
received a refunds for her 2016 state and federal income taxes, and her federal return
was applied to her student loans. She has a $2,536 obligation with the IRS for tax year
2017. In August 2019, she submitted an installment agreement request for tax year 2017.
Applicant has an installment agreement to pay her state income taxes. (AE A; AE C; AE

Applicant  received  credit  counseling from 2004 until  2006,  while  she  was  in  the
Army Reserve, and in 2016 through her church. She follows a written budget, is able to
live within her means, and has no new delinquent debts. Applicant identified that she did
not learn how to handle finances from her family,  and she has been working to correct
this issue by attending counseling and following a written budget.  Additionally, she has
been attempting to secure a second job to help pay down her debt. (AE G; AE J, at 7; AE
P; Tr. 65-70)
Applicant  received  an  Army  Good  Conduct  Medal;  National  Defense  Service
Medal;  Global  War  on  Terrorism  Service  Medal;  Army  Service  Ribbon;  and  a

friends,  family  members,  and  work  associates.  She  is  described  as  a  person  of

regarding her performance. [Applicant] is dependable, thoughtful, and well regarded…”
and  she  recommended  that  Applicant  receive  her  clearance.  Applicant’s  most  recent
performance appraisal recognized that she is responsible, reliable, and trustworthy. (AE
