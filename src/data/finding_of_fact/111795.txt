I have incorporated Applicant’s admissions in his response to the allegations set
forth in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c in my findings of fact, and I have noted his comments on each
allegation.  Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  GE  2,  his  SCA,  unless
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings,  the Government’s FORM, Applicant’s response to the FORM,
and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant,  58,  has  worked  as  a  material  handler  for  three  different  federal
contractors since January 2012. His education history is not in the record. He served in
the U.S. Army for two years until he failed a drug test in 1984. He received a General
Discharge under Other than Honorable Conditions. He married in 1994 and was divorced
in  2004.  Applicant  was  granted  a  security  clearance  in  2012  in  connection  with  his
employment with the defense contractor. With the submission of his March 2018 SCA, he
seeks to renew his clearance eligibility.
SOR Allegations, Evidence and Findings
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b – Two Credit-Card Accounts with a Creditor Charged-Off
in the Amounts of $1,528 and $192, respectively – Applicant opened two credit-card
accounts with the same creditor in October 2014 and February 2016. In March 2017, he
defaulted  on  both  accounts,  and  they  were  charged  off.  In  his SOR answer, Applicant
responded  that  he  had  been  making  payments  on  the  smaller  debt  and  that  his  last
payment would be made on September 6, 2019. He also wrote that he was in contact
with  the  creditor  and  intended  to  begin  making  payments  on  the  larger  debt  once  the
smaller debt was paid off. In his FORM response, he updated the status of the larger debt
that is the subject of SOR ¶1.a. He wrote that he made arrangements to pay the creditor
and that the account will be satisfied by March 31, 2020. (GE 4 at 2, 4, 6; GE 5 at 2-4.)
SOR  ¶  1.c  –  Car  Loan  Charged  Off  in  the  Amount  of  $15,310  –  Applicant
opened this account in April 2015 to finance the purchase of a car. The original amount
of the loan was $25,928. He stopped paying the loan in January 2018 due to a dispute
with the lender. He stored the vehicle, a convertible, in a family member’s garage during
the winter and reduced his insurance coverage by dropping the collision coverage while
the  vehicle  was  stored.  In  response,  the  lender  increased  his  monthly  payments  from
$533  to  $1,019.  Applicant  was  unable  to  pay  the  increased  monthly  amount,  and  he
voluntarily returned the car to the lender in February 2018. He understood that after the
resale of the vehicle, he was obligated to pay a deficiency of $2,000. When shown his
credit  report during  his  February  2019  background  interview,  he  learned  that  the bank
was seeking to collect $17,002. Applicant disputes the debt and has retained counsel to
represent him. On April 10, 2019, his attorney wrote to the creditor disputing the debt on
two grounds, the improper surcharge for insurance and noncompliance with the Uniform
Commercial Code in the resale of the vehicle. On May 24, 2019, the lender’s lawyer wrote
Applicant and stated that the debt was $10,319, much less than the $17,002 and $15,310
figures  the  creditor  reported  to  the  credit  bureaus.  The  creditor  then  filed  a  lawsuit.
Applicant’s attorney represented in a letter addressed to DOHA that the court has ruled
that the case presents factual issues requiring a trial, presumably in a ruling denying the
creditor’s motion for summary judgment. The attorney also writes that a trial date has not
yet been set. (GE 1 at 6; GE 2 at 32-33; GE 3 at 11; GE 4 at 5; GE 5 at 3; FORM response
at 2, 14.)
SOR ¶ 1.d –Credit Account for the Purchase of Furniture Charged-Off in the
Amount  of  $1,644  –  In  December  2012,  Applicant  opened  this  account  to  purchase
furniture. He defaulted on the payments in February 2017. He subsequently entered into
a payment plan with the creditor paying it $89 per month. The debt was fully repaid on
December 31, 2018, as evidenced by a letter from the creditor. (GE 1 at 7; GE 3 at 11.)
Whole-Person Evidence
Applicant  submitted  two  character  reference  letters  and  four  commendations
relating to his work for the Army. This evidence strongly supports Applicant, stating he is
a person of good character and integrity, as well as a leader and subject matter expert.
His  work  has  made  significant  contributions  to  the  Army  warfighter.  Applicant  also
submitted  similar  evidence  with  his  response  to  the  FORM.  (GE  3  at  12-17;  FORM
response at 5-14.)
