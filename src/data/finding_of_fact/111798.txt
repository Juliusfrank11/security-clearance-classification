Applicant,  age  57,  is  married  with  three  adult  children.  He  honorably  served  in
the U.S. Army from 1986 until he retired in 2008.  His educational background was not
specified in the record. He has been employed as an electronic technician by the same
defense  contractor  since  1997.  He  was  granted  a  DOD  security  clearance  that  same
year.
The  SOR  alleged
five  delinquent  debts
that  Applicant  accrued
totaling
approximately  $40,000,  and  that  he  deliberately  failed  to  disclose  one  of  them  on  his
SCA:  a  $27,647  home-improvement  loan  (SOR  ¶  1.b).  Applicant  denied  each  of  the
SOR  allegations.  However,  they  were  confirmed  by  his  credit  reports.  The  account
alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  was  charged  off  in  March  2015  with  a  last  date  of  activity  in
August 2012. The accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e were placed for collection in
December  2015  and  April  2015,  respectively;  with  last  dates  of  activity  in  November
2012 and August 2013, respectively. As of March 2019, the accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶
1.a and 1.c. were each approximately 30 days delinquent. (Item 3; Item 6 at 3, 6; Item 7
at 1, 2)
The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  is  a  30-year  fixed-rate  mortgage  loan  that
Applicant  opened  in  February  2003  in  the  amount  of  $123,036.  He  initially  fell  behind
with his monthly payments in February 2013. From approximately October 2013 through
September  2016,  the  account  was  120  days  or  more  delinquent.  He  became  current
with  his  payments  in  approximately  October  2016,  apparently  due  to  a  loan
modification.  By  March  2019,  he  had  fallen  approximately  30  days  behind  with  his
payments,  with  a  $900  past-due  balance.  He  paid  on  time  from  April  2019  through
October  2019,  when  his  account  status  was  “pays  as  agreed”  with  no  outstanding
balance. (AE A at 14-18; Item 6 at 4; Item 7 at 1)
The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  is  a  home-improvement  loan  that  Applicant
opened in March 2003 in the amount of $31,928. The account was charged off in March
2015  in  the  amount  of  $27,647.  There  is  no  information  in  the  record  about  any
payments made following the charge off, but the reported balance due is $24,511. (Item
6 at 3; Item 7 at 2)
The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  is  an  automobile  loan  that  Applicant  opened  in
November 2011  in  the  amount of $30,083.  Between  April 2015 and  April 2019,  he fell
30  days  behind  in  his $740  monthly  payment  approximately  10  times.  In  March  2019,
his  account  was  approximately  30  days  past  due  with  a  $9,984  remaining  balance.  In
October 2019, the account was “paid and closed” with no remaining balance due. (AE A
at 31-33; Item 6 at 4; Item 7 at 2)
The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.d  is  an  unknown  account  that  was  placed  for
collection  in  December  2015  with  a  $1,098  balance.  Applicant’s  March  2019  credit
report notes that he disputed the account information with the credit bureau. However,
there  was  no  basis  alleged  in  the  record  to  dispute  the  legitimacy  of  the  account,  nor
any documentation to establish that the credit bureau changed the delinquent status of
account after the dispute. (Item 6 at 3; Item 7 at 2)
The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  is  a  credit-card  account  that  was  placed  for
collection in April 2015 with a $441 balance. Applicant claimed that the balance resulted
from  fraudulent  use  of  his  credit  card.  However,  it  was  reported  on  his  January  2018,
March 2019, and October 2019 credit reports without any reference to a dispute by him.
He did not otherwise provide documentary evidence to substantiate the alleged fraud or
of any actions he took to resolve the issue. (AE A at 45-47; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 6; Item
7 at 2)
Applicant certified his “no” responses to questions on his SCA about whether he
had any financial delinquencies in January 2018. He was interviewed in August 2018 to
discuss,  among  other  matters,  financial  issues  developed  during  the  course  of  his
security-clearance  investigation.  During  the  interview,  Applicant  initially  reaffirmed  that
he had no financial problems, was meeting all of his financial obligations, did not have
any accounts in collections, and was not late on any payments. After being confronted
with the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d, he stated that he was unaware of them
and could not provide any information. He reiterated that he took care of all his financial
obligations.  After  he  was  confronted  about  it,  he  acknowledged  the  credit-card  debt
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e. He claimed that the debt related to charges made after the credit
card had been stolen 10 years prior. While he averred that he had contacted the bank at
the time it was stolen, he neither filed a police report nor had any other documentation
to  corroborate  the  theft  or  his  communication  with  the  bank.  He  stated  that  he  would
contact  the  creditor and  pay  the debt,  if  necessary.  At  the  conclusion  of  the  interview,
Applicant  reiterated  that  his  overall  financial  situation  was  good,  he  never  sought  or
received  any  financial  counseling,  and  he  would  be  more  proactive  to  assure  the
accuracy of his credit report. (Item 5 at 2)
Applicant  did  not  enumerate  his  relevant  income  and  expense  history  or
otherwise  explain  the  circumstances  underlying  his  accumulation  of  the  delinquent
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d. There were no account disputes noted in the
October 2019 credit report Applicant provided with his SOR response. That report did,
however, reveal that he had opened three new auto-loan accounts between May 2019
and August 2019 with monthly payments totaling $1,565. (AE A at 19-24, 28-30; Item 2;
Item 7 at 2)
