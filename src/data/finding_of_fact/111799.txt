Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  Guideline  F  allegations  contained  in  the  SOR  that
remained after the Government’s withdrawal of the four mentioned above, except those
in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.i, and 1.q, which he denied. (Tr. 10) He denied the Guideline E allegation.
Applicant is 55 years old. He served in the Navy from 1986 to 2006, when he retired
and received an honorable discharge as an E-5. He and his first wife were married 24
years and divorced. They have four adult children. He has been married to his second
wife  for  four  years.  He  does  not  have  any  children  with  her.  He  has  three  young
grandchildren,  who  live  with  him  and  his  second  wife.  In  January  2017,  he  began  his
current contractor position with the Navy. (Tr. 18-20)
Applicant has a history of financial problems, dating back to when he was in the
Navy  and  applying for  a security  clearance.  During a  background  interview  in  January
2004 with a government investigator, he discussed his 2003 Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which
he filed to dispose of his debts and avoid a wage garnishment. (GE 4) Subsequently, he
was not granted a security clearance. (Tr. 53)
On  December  12,  2016,  Applicant  submitted  an  Electronic  Questionnaires  for
Investigations Processing (e-QIP). In it, he disclosed a 2014 bankruptcy and a delinquent
loan.  After  filing  his  e-QIP,  Applicant  was  interviewed  in  June  2018  by  a  government
investigator. During the background interview, Applicant was confronted with additional
financial delinquencies listed on a February 2017 credit bureau report (CBR), including
many  debts  which  were  owed  to  credit  card  companies.  He  addressed  all  of  the
investigator’s inquiries. He said he had closed many of the credit card accounts. (GE 7)
Applicant testified that he and his first wife filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2003.
His wife was not working at time, and he did not earn enough money to support her and
their four children. According to the bankruptcy documents, he discharged over $32,500
of debt, which consisted of primarily retail and credit card accounts. (Tr. 23; GE 4, GE 6)
Applicant testified that he filed his 2014 Chapter 7 bankruptcy as a consequence
of his divorce from his first wife in 2011. He was still paying child support then and earning
a small salary. He thinks the court discharged approximately $28,000 of delinquent debts
in that bankruptcy, which included retail and credit card accounts. (Tr. 23-24: GE 5)
Applicant  attributed  his  present  financial  problems  to  several  factors:  periods  of
unemployment,  including  four  months  before  he  started  his  current  position;  his  2011
divorce from his first wife; providing support for his stepdaughter; and two moves in seven
months to accommodate three grandchildren, whom he supports. (Tr. 11-12, 21; Answer
-2) After discharging delinquent debts in his 2014 bankruptcy, Applicant said he opened
new credit card accounts and used them to pay bills. When the payments on the cards
became due, he was unable to pay them. He acknowledged that he made a poor decision
in opening those accounts. (Tr. 24-25)
Based on Applicant’s admissions and credit bureau reports (CBR) from February
2017 and May 2019, the SOR alleged: two Chapter 7 bankruptcies, in 2003 and 2014;
two charged-off automobile loans; and ten delinquent debts, including credit cards. The
automobile  loans  and  other  debts  became  delinquent  between  2014  and  2018,  and
totaled  $23,325.  (GE  2,  GE  3)  None  of  the  12  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  have  been
resolved. (Tr. 60)
Applicant  contacted  some  creditors  in  the  past,  but  does  not  have  any  current
payment plans. He said he cancelled many of the cards and no longer uses them. (Tr.
24-25)
Applicant does not have a written budget. His net monthly salary income is about
$3,000. He also receives $1,500 a month from his military retirement and $1,600 a month
as a VA disability benefit. His wife’s monthly income is $2,400. She uses her salary to
support her 36-year-old developmentally disabled daughter, who lives independently. He
has  not  sought  financial  counseling  since  2014,  when  he  filed  bankruptcy.  Appellant’s
wife is not involved in managing their household finances. (Tr. 43, 45-46, 61-62)
Applicant said his financial situation has improved since his first wife died in 2018.
He no longer pays her part of his military retirement, and his child support payments have
stopped as all of his children have reached their majority. He said he has an extra $1,350
after paying his bills. (Tr. 24, 46)
In  response  to  question  Section  26:  Financial  Record  of  his  e-QIP,  Applicant
disclosed that he filed bankruptcy in 2014 and had a delinquent loan. He did not disclose
any other delinquent debts or the charged-off accounts alleged in the SOR. (GE 1) He
testified that he did not read the questions carefully before he answered them. He knew
he had some indebtedness. He said the computer he was using was old and not working
well. Some of the alleged debts were not delinquent at the time he submitted the SOR,
as noted in the summary of his interview. He testified that he did not attempt to deceive
the Government by failing to disclose all of his delinquent debts. (Tr. 55-57; GE 1, GE 7)
