The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the June 10, 2019 SOR, Applicant
owed $35,459 in delinquent consumer-credit debt on ten accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d, 1.f-1.j,
and 1.m) and $2,729 in medical collection debt on six accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.k-1.l, and
1.n-1.p). When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he admitted that the debts are
legitimate and attributed them to having only his income in the household to pay medical
expenses (including for ambulance and emergency room services) incurred  by his spouse
and son and living expenses. He added that he was unsuccessful in negotiating affordable
payment plans with his creditors. (Item 2.)
After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant’s Answer to the SOR (Item 2),
I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is a 63-year-old inspector with a defense contractor. He has worked for his
employer since February 1984 and holds a secret clearance. He and his spouse married in
March 2005, and they have an 11-year-old son. (Item 3.)
On  May  5,  2016,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He responded affirmatively to an
inquiry concerning whether he was currently utilizing or seeking assistance from a credit
counseling service or similar resource to resolve financial difficulties. He indicated that he
had fallen behind on credit-card debt and that he had “just started” working with a credit
resolution company. He also answered “Yes” to inquiries regarding delinquency involving
routine accounts and disclosed that he had seven credit-card debts and four medical bills
totaling  $38,424  for  which  he  is  legally  liable  and  stated,  “My  son  has  had  medical
conditions since 2012 that has [sic] caused me to fall behind in my financial obligations.”
Concerning  actions  taken  to  resolve  these  debts,  Applicant  explained  that  he  was  in
contact with an agency recommended by his employer through its Employee Assistance
Program for assistance in consolidating his debts and creating a financially responsible
plan to pay off his debts. (Item 3.)
A check of Applicant’s credit on July 26, 2016, revealed several credit-card and
medical-account  delinquencies.  A  credit-card  account  with  a  $14,900  credit  limit  was
charged off for $15,987 in July 2014, after inactivity since November 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.a). A
credit-card account with a $5,000 credit limit had been in collection for $5,653 for at least
two years as of July 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.b). A credit-card account, opened with a toy retailer in
July 2013, was placed for collection in August 2014 after nonpayment since January 2014.
As of July 2016, the collection balance was $2,261 (SOR ¶ 1.c).  A credit-card debt of
$1,822 from August 2013 was assigned for collection in April 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.d). A credit-
card account, opened in April 2012, was placed for collection in August 2014 for $1,185
(SOR ¶ 1.f). A credit-card account with a retailer, opened in November 2013, was placed
for  collection  for  $884  in  June  2015  after  inactivity  since  February  2014  (SOR  ¶  1.g).
Another credit-card account with a retailer, opened in March 2012 with a $500 credit limit,
was charged off for $714 in August 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.h).  A $637 credit-card debt was in
collection after no activity since August 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.i). Applicant was an authorized user
on the account. A store credit card, obtained in October 2009, became past due and was
charged off for $606 in November 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.j). A $5,139 credit-card judgment was
entered against Applicant in October 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.m). As of July 2016, Applicant also
owed medical collection debts of $1,570 from November 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.e); $111 from
April 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.l); $408 from September 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.n); $377 from February 2013
(SOR ¶ 1.o); and $211 from December 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.p). (Item 5.)
On September 20, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  He  stated  that  he  had  contacted  a  debt
resolution company about one month prior to completing his May 2016 SF 86, and that he
was advised to file a bankruptcy petition and seek advice from an attorney. He did neither
and had no further contact with the company. Applicant admitted that he was not currently
utilizing  or  seeking  assistance  from  a  credit  counseling  service  or  similar  resource  to
resolve his financial difficulties. Applicant did not dispute the judgment debt on his record
but  indicated  that  it  had  been  incurred  by  his  spouse.  He  acknowledged  that  he  was
responsible for the debts incurred by his spouse using his credit. When asked to detail his
debts, he provided information from a September 17, 2018 credit report which confirmed
several of the delinquent accounts in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a-1.b, 1.f-1.j, and 1.m).  Applicant
stated that his financial problems began in 2010 or 2011 because of insufficient income
and medical expenses for his son, who has a neurological disorder, and that he used credit
cards for day-to-day living expenses. Applicant disputed the medical collection debts on his
record and some of the credit entries that he did not recognize. He explained that he had
made no attempt to make payments on his delinquencies because he has only had enough
money to pay his mortgage and his taxes. He denied any use of any credit cards since
2014, stating that he uses cash for purchases. He expressed a long term plan to pay off his
delinquent debt once his mortgage loan is satisfied in a few years. (Item 4.)
Applicant was re-interviewed by the OPM investigator on September 27, 2018. After
checking  his financial record, he no longer disputed any of the debts on the SOR. He
acknowledged that he had incurred the credit-card debt that went to judgment (SOR ¶
1.m). As for his plans to address his past-due debts, Applicant related that his mortgage
would be paid off in four years, and his spouse’s car would be paid off in three to four
years. At that time, he would have the income to make payments on his delinquent debts if
his creditors were willing to work with him. (Item 4.)
As of April 2019, Equifax was reporting delinquent debts totaling $37,154 (SOR ¶¶
1.a-1.m)  on  Applicant’s  credit  record.  He  has  no  new  credit-card  debt  on  his  record.
Applicant was reportedly making timely payments of $805 per month on his mortgage with
a $30,519 balance and $409 per month on an automobile loan obtained for $29,978 in July
2013. The balance of the car loan was $6,822. (Item 6.)
On  June  10,  2019,  the  DOD  CAF  issued  a  SOR  to  Applicant  because  of  his
unresolved credit-card debts. (Item 1.) In his August 14, 2019 response, Applicant cited as
causes for his legitimate debts medical bills for his wife and son; only his income in the
household; utility bills, property taxes and food; and unexpected emergency room and
ambulance expenses. Applicant explained that he tried to negotiate workable payment
plans with creditors without success. (Item 2.) He provided no details or specifics about his
income or expenses.
In  the  September  5,  2019  FORM,  Applicant  was  placed  on  notice  of  the
Government’s concern about his failure to provide any documentary evidence to show that
he acted responsibly toward his creditors or that he has any repayment plans in place for
his debts. In rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant had an opportunity to provide information of
medical bills and other expenses; of his current income; and of contacts with creditors
about affordable repayment terms for his debts. There is no indication that he responded
by the October 10, 2019 deadline.
