In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. However, with
respect to SOR ¶ 2.a, alleging falsification of his SCA, he admitted that his answer to a
question was incorrect but denied deliberate falsification. I have treated his response to
SOR  ¶  2.a  as  a  denial.  His  admissions  in  his  answer  and  at  the  hearing  are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is a  35-year-old  electrical engineer employed  by  a defense  contractor
since  October  2014.  He  has  been  employed  by  defense  contractors  since  September
2007. He has held security clearance since 2005. (Tr. 42.)
Applicant  married  in  August  2005,  separated  in  June  2016,  reconciled  in
February or March 2017, and separated again in January 2018. He has three children,
ages 13, 11, and 7, and a stepchild, age 19. He received an associate’s degree in May
2006 and a bachelor’s degree in May 2012.
In  June  2017,  Applicant  and  his wife filed a joint  Chapter 7  bankruptcy  petition.
Applicant testified he and his wife decided to file a bankruptcy petition  to allow them to
start with a “clean slate” and remove the burden of indebtedness on their effort to restart
their marriage. (Tr. 21- 22.)
The bankruptcy petition listed assets of $295,708 and liabilities of $422,090. The
debts listed in the petition included two student loans incurred by Applicant in 2002 for
$37,000 and $48,000; the mortgage loan on the marital home for $241,000, legal fees
of  $9,000  incurred  by  Applicant;  legal  fees  of  $14,600  incurred  by  Applicant’s  wife;
medical bills totaling $12,290, mostly incurred by Applicant’s wife; and credit-card debts
totaling $24,650 incurred in Applicant’s name only, but which he attributed to his wife’s
spending habits. It is not clear from the record whether the two student loans included in
the  bankruptcy  petition  were  duplicates.  They  retained  one  car  and  the  marital  home.
Applicant’s  wife  was  not  employed  outside  the  home  when  they  filed  their  bankruptcy
petition. The  bankruptcy  petition  listed  net monthly  income  of  $6,842 and  expenses  of
$6,796. Both debtors received a discharge in October 2017. (GX 6.)
When  Applicant  was  first  hired  by  his  current  employer,  his  annual  salary  was
about  $65,000.  He  has  since  been  promoted  several  times  and  his  annual  salary  has
increased to about $110,000 (Tr. 39.)
In  January  2018,  Applicant  saw  his  stepdaughter  looking  through  mail  that  had
been delivered to their home. He attempted to take the mail from her, and she accused
him of  grabbing  her arm,  spinning her around,  and  shoving  her into  the  kitchen  stove.
The  sheriff’s  deputy  who  came  to  the  home  and  investigated  the  incident  determined
that there was insufficient evidence to file charges. Applicant’s wife filed a petition for an
emergency  protective  order,  and  the  magistrate  found  the  stepdaughter’s  testimony
credible  and  issued  the  protective  order.  Applicant’s  wife  then  filed  charges  of  assault
and  battery  on  a  family  member,  and  Applicant  was  convicted.  He  appealed.  In
accordance with local law, the case was tried de novo on appeal. He was offered a plea
agreement, which he declined. The case went to trial in August 2018 and was continued
for six months, with the stipulation that the charges would be dismissed if there were no
further  incidents.  The  charges  were  dismissed  in  March  2019.  (SOR  Answer,
Enclosures  1  and  2;  GX  2  at  2;  GX  3.)  Applicant  moved  out  of  the  house  after  the
January incident. He and his wife have lived apart since that incident, but they are not
divorced.
Applicant  testified  that  the  January  2018  incident  was  the  second  time  his  wife
had filed false charges against him. According to Applicant, she had filed a petition for a
protective  order  about  a  year  earlier,  alleging  that  he  had  assaulted  her.  Her  petition
was  dismissed  because  Applicant  had  a  tape  recorder  in  his  pocket  during  the
argument  during  which  she  alleged  he  assaulted  her.  The  recording  reflected  that
Applicant’s  wife  was  the  aggressive  party.  Applicant  presented  no  documentary
evidence supporting his testimony about this earlier incident.
In April 2018, Applicant and his wife joined in a Pendente Lite order providing for
joint  custody  of  their  three  children,  visitation  rights,  and  allocation  of  marital  debts.
Applicant  agreed  to  pay  his  wife  $3,311  per  month,  allocated  as  follows:  $821  in
spousal support; $1,565 in child support; and $926 in family-debt adjustment. (AX A.) In
July  2019,  they  executed  a  consent order on  child  custody  and  visitation,  superseding
the Pendente Lite order and amplifying the conditions for custody and visitation. (AX B.)
When  Applicant  submitted  his  SCA  in  April  2018,  he  did  not  disclose  student
loans  totaling  about  $38,811  that  were  reflected  as  180  days  past  due  in  the  credit
report from June 2018. (GX 5.) Applicant testified that he understood when they started
the  bankruptcy  process  that  the  student  loans  would  not  be  discharged.  However,  he
remembered  that  the  student  loans  were  included  among  the  debts  listed  in  the
bankruptcy  petition,  and  he  testified  that  he  vaguely  remembered  seeing  a  document
that led him to believe that the student loans might be included in the debts that were
discharged. (Tr. 48-49.) After he was interviewed by a security investigator in November
2018, he knew that his student loans had not been discharged. (Tr. 55.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  making  automatic  monthly  payments  on  his
student loans for about three years after he received his bachelor’s degree. (Tr. 51.) He
stopped making payments around May 2015 because he could not afford them, and he
had not resumed payments when he filed his bankruptcy petition in June 2017. (Tr. 55.)
He  put  the  student  loans  on  the  “back  burner”  until  he  received  the  SOR.  He  then
contacted  the  loan  servicer  about  an  income-based  repayment  plan.  He  had  not
received a response from the loan servicer by the time the record closed. (Tr. 56-57.)
Although Applicant did not disclose the delinquent student loans in his SCA,  he
disclosed  other  derogatory  information,  including  the  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  and  arrest
for assault and battery in January 2018. (GX 1 at 37-38, 42-43.) He denied deliberately
falsifying  or  omitting  information.  He  admitted  at  the  hearing  that  he  should  have
disclosed the delinquent student loans. (Tr. 59.)
