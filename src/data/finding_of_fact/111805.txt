Applicant admitted the SOR allegations with the exception of 1.a, 1.i, and 1.j.
Applicant acknowledged his delinquent tax debts, but stated that he has filed his
income  tax  returns  for  the  years  in  question  when  he  learned  about  them  through  the
security process. (Tr. 16) At that point, he set up payment plans for each of the years with
the IRS.  (Tr. 17) He also stated that one account has been charged off and one account
cannot be located. (Answer) SOR allegation 1.a.
In 2017, Applicant filed his 2010 Federal income tax return, and he owed $675 for
that tax year. He entered into an installment agreement with the IRS in June 2017, but he
has not made any payments. (Tr. 22) He also entered into an agreement in 2017 for tax
owed  ($6,117)  from  2013.  He  agreed  to  pay  $225  a  month,  but  the  agreement  was
cancelled in 2018. (GE 4) He has not made any other payments. For the tax period 2014,
Applicant  owed  $4,554  and  in  2015  he  established  an  installment  agreement  with  the
IRS.  He made about eight payments between January 2016 and June 2016. During that
time  three  checks  were  dishonored,  and  by  October  2016,  Applicant  was  no  longer  in
payment  status.  (Tr.  25)  He  had  no  good  reason  for  not  continuing  the  payments.
Applicant responded that “life” just happened. (Tr. 25) At the time, Applicant was earning
about $84,000 a year. His wife also worked and the combined income was $124,816. (Tr.
26) Applicant initiated another tax agreement in 2015, which was abandoned by 2018.
No payments were made. (GE 5) In May 2017, the IRS initiated a second notice of intent
to  levy.  Then,  in  June  2017,  Applicant  entered  into  an  installment  agreement  for  a
combined 2010, 2013, 2014 and 2015 tax debt. This was prior to completing his 2017
security  clearance  application.  No  payments  were  made.  (Tr.  29)  The  2016  Federal
income tax return was filed in 2018. Applicant owes $5,209 and has made no payments.
The same pattern continued for tax period 2017. In May 2019, Applicant entered into an
installment agreement with the IRS for delinquent taxes stemming from 2010, 2013, 2014,
2015,  2016,  and  2017.  (Tr.  29)  The  agreed  upon  payment  was  $415  monthly  to  be
deducted from his salary. He stated that no payments were deducted as scheduled and
no payments made, and he does not understand why that happened. (Tr. 30) He is still
under a 2019 payment agreement. (GE 6)
Applicant’s  response  to  why  he  waited  until  2019  to  re-initiate  an  installment
agreement  for  delinquent  IRS  taxes  was  humiliation  and  being  humbled.  (Tr.  31)  He
admitted that he has been quite “lax.” (Tr. 31)
In Applicant’s 2018 subject interview, he explained that he was not aware of the
filing issue because his wife always handled the finances. He also stated that he did not
intentionally not file because he thought his wife filed and also set up payment plans. (GE

As  to  SOR  allegation  1.h,  Applicant  admitted  his  state  delinquent  taxes  in  the
amount  of  $1,956,  and  he  attached  a  2019  proof  of  payment  plan  to  settle  the  debt.
(Answer) He was to pay $385 a month to the comptroller of the state. No payments have
been made. (Tr. 32; GE 7, 8)
Applicant denied the debt in SOR 1.i, a debt for $9,870 because it is charged off.
However, Applicant produced a document that reflected the loan amount was cancelled
in an IRS Form 1099-C. (AE A)
Applicant  denied  the  medical  account  in  SOR  1.j  for  $138,  because  he  has  not
been able to locate the account and it does not appear on his 2017 credit bureau report.
(Tr. 33) He has not made any attempts to contact the creditor even though it appears on
a newer credit report. (Tr. 34)
As  to  SOR  1.k,  a  collection  account  in  the  amount  of  $290,  Applicant  paid  the
account on August 2, 2019 and provided documentation to confirm. (AE B)
