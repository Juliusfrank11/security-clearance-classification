In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) He
also  provided  extenuating  and  mitigating  information.  Applicant’s  admissions  are
accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.
Applicant is a 55-year-old communication system engineer, who was employed by
a DOD contractor from September 2007 to August 2018. (Tr. 6, 23, 25-26; GE 1) He was
recently hired by another DOD contractor. In 1987, he was commissioned in the Air Force.
(Tr. 8) He was deployed to Afghanistan from August 2005 to January 2006. (Tr. 9) His Air
Force specialty was information technology communications. (Tr. 10) In 2007, he retired
from the Air Force as a lieutenant colonel. (Tr. 8, 23) His highest award  was the Joint
Service Commendation Medal. (Tr. 9) He held a security clearance continuously since
1987  when  he  joined  the  Air  Force.  (Tr.  23-24)  In  2013,  he  was  granted  access  to
sensitive compartmented information (SCI). (Tr. 24)
In  1983,  Applicant  graduated  from  high  school,  and  in  1987,  he  received  a
bachelor’s degree with a major in electrical engineering. (Tr. 7; GE 1) In 1994, he received
his first master’s degree in information systems; in 2002, he received his second master’s
degree in military operational art and science; and in 2016, he received his third master’s
degree  in  science  and  religion.  (Tr.  7-8;  GE  1)  In  1998,  he  married  and  his  two  step
children are ages 34 and 38. (Tr. 12)
Sexual Behavior, Use of Information Technology, and Personal Conduct
SOR ¶¶ 2 (use of information technology) and 3 (personal conduct) cross-allege
conduct that is alleged in SOR ¶ 1 (sexual behavior).
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant received verbal counseling on at least two occasions
for viewing pornographic websites from August 1998 to July 2001. (Tr. 34) On about two
or three occasions,  he  used his government-owned  desktop  computer in  his  Air  Force
office to access pornographic websites for 10 to 15 minutes on each occasion. (Tr. 35-
36, 75; GE 3) It was at the end of the duty day. (Tr. 35) He did not intentionally download
any pornography on his computer. (Tr. 38) He was verbally counseled and told to stop
accessing  pornographic  websites  with  his  government  computer.  (Tr.  38)  The  first
counseling did not seem to be with serious intent. (Tr. 39) “It was given to me with like a
wink” with an instruction to “knock it off.” (Tr. 39) The policy against using a government
computer to access pornography was informal and not well developed at that time. (Tr.
39-40) He acknowledged that his computer had access to sensitive information, and his
actions  could  have  compromised  that  information  technology  system  by  exposing  it  to
viruses and malware. (Tr. 41) At the time he was accessing the pornographic sites, he
was not thinking about the risk to sensitive information. (Tr. 41)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant received a letter of reprimand in about October 2004
while serving on active duty for misuse of a government computer. (Tr. 42) He admitted
that he accessed pornographic websites on a government-issued computer. (Tr. 42) The
computer he used was a Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) computer that was in
a break area. (Tr. 32) The MWR computer was for general access to enable Air Force
employees to access their email, and the MWR computer was not assigned to Applicant.
(Tr. 42) He  went  to  two  or three pornographic  websites  over the  course  of one day  in
September 2004. (Tr. 42-43) He did not intentionally download any pornography on the
MWR computer. (Tr. 38) His computer misuse was detected through a computer log that
was  used  to  monitor  the  computer’s  use.  (Tr.  44)  There  was  no  evidence  that  the
pornography  was  downloaded  or  saved  on  the  MWR  computer.  (Tr.  45)  In  2004,  he
viewed  pornography  at  home  on  an  infrequent  basis.  (Tr.  46)  He  received  some
counseling from a licensed counselor to address his pornography issue; however, it was
ineffective. (Tr. 47) The letter of reprimand was for violation of a regulation under Article
92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). See. e.g., DOD Regulation 5500.7-R, Joint
Ethics Regulation, (Aug. 30, 1993), ¶ 2-301(2)(d). The reprimand adversely affected his
future assignments, and he was not selected for promotion to colonel. (Tr. 73) During his
November  7,  2007,  Office  of  Personnel  Management  personal  subject  interview,
Applicant  said  he  learned  his  lesson  about  misuse  of  government  computers  after  his
reprimand in 2004. (Tr. 49; GE 3)
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  used  an  employer-owned  computer  to  view
pornographic websites from about January 2018 to about July 2018. He resigned in lieu
of  being  terminated  by  his  employer  for  this  misuse  of  his  employer’s  computer.  He
viewed the pornography in his employer’s building in a conference room. (Tr. 50, 55) He
turned  off  the  virtual  private  network  (VPN)  connection  to  circumvent  or  bypass  his
employer’s  firewall.  (Tr.  59)  Switching  off  the  VPN  enabled  him  to  access  sites  his
employer would normally block. (Tr. 59) He acknowledged that by turning off the VPN he
engaged  in  “unauthorized  manipulation  of  an  information  system.”  (Tr.  59)  He  also
deleted the search logs after he went to the pornographic websites. (Tr. 72)
Applicant  viewed  pornography  once  or  twice  a  month  using  his  employer’s
computer, and he accessed the sites for one or two hours at a time. (Tr. 50; GE 3) He
accessed the sites during lunchtime or when things were slow at the office. (Tr. 51; GE
3) He estimated that he downloaded about 1,000 pictures but no videos, and he deleted
the pictures within 24 hours after downloading them. (Tr. 53-54) His employer did not find
any pornography on the computer he used to access pornographic websites. (Tr. 59) He
said  the  computer  he  misused  did  not  directly  affect  DOD.  (Tr.  30)  His  employer’s
computer did not directly access a DOD network; however, this computer did access his
employer’s  network.  (Tr.  30-31)  His  misuse  of  his  employer’s  computer  violated  his
employer’s policies and procedures. (Tr. 58) He committed multiple infractions because
after he misused his employer’s computer the first time, and nothing happened, he did
not believe his employer was serious about enforcement of prohibitions against accessing
pornography on his employer’s computers. (Tr. 55-57) He resigned from his employment
because he believed it was likely that he would be fired. (Tr. 57)
Applicant received routine annual briefings on security and information systems.
(Tr.  32-33)  Throughout  his  career,  Applicant  was  aware  that  he  was  not  permitted  to
access pornography websites or view pornography using government or his employer’s
computers.  (Tr.  31-32)  He  viewed  pornographic  websites  for  pleasure.  (Tr.  36)  He
became  sexually  aroused;  however,  he  did  not  masturbate  while  viewing  the
pornography. (Tr. 37, 52) He did not view child pornography. (Tr. 38) He conceded that
in  the  past  he  had  a  problem  with  or  addiction  to  pornography.  (Tr.  46-47)  Applicant
infrequently viewed pornography on his home computer from 2004 to 2018. (Tr. 49)
Theoretically,  when  Applicant  downloaded  a  pornographic  picture  onto  his
employer’s computer, that picture might have contained a virus that could be transferred
onto his employer’s network. (Tr. 75-76) The virus could be transferred via his employer’s
network onto a Microsoft Word document or PowerPoint presentation, and in turn, when
these items were sent to the DOD, the virus could be downloaded onto the DOD network.
(Tr. 75-76) Applicant was not thinking about possible penetration of security or creation
of  a  “backdoor”  into the  DOD network when he  was  looking at pornography  or visiting
pornographic websites using his employer’s computer. (Tr. 77)
Applicant reluctantly conceded that in the past he was “addicted” to pornography.
(Tr. 70) His viewing of pornography was a choice, and ultimately, he had the power  or
free will and could choose not to view pornography. (Tr. 70) He said that in the past he
had a compulsion to view pornography, and he “fell into a bondage area.” (Tr. 70)
Applicant met with his pastor on a weekly basis from August 2018 to about March
2019, and less frequently thereafter for counseling to help with his pornography issue.
(Tr. 62-66; SOR response) After July 2018, Applicant viewed pornography on his home
computer  on  only  one  occasion.  (Tr.  61)  He  disclosed  this  viewing  to  his  spouse  and
pastor. (Tr. 61) Occasionally his spouse attended the meetings with his pastor. (Tr. 64)
His  spouse  has  complete  knowledge  of  his  issue  with  pornography.  (Tr.  64)  Applicant
disclosed his misuse of computers involving pornography to security, coworkers, friends,
people  at  church,  and  family.  (Tr.  60,  66;  GE  3)  He  was  not  worried  about  public
disclosure of his past problem with pornography because of his success in his endeavors
to stop viewing pornography. (Tr. 67-68) He expressed his remorse for his involvement
with pornography. (Tr. 83)
Character Evidence
A  GS-15,  who  has  known  Applicant  for  14  years  in  a  professional  capacity,
described  Applicant  as  having  excellent  integrity  and  loyalty.  (SOR  response)  His

received an annual merit increase and spot bonus increase from his employer for his hard
work. (AE B)
Applicant’s  pastor  has  provided  counseling  to  Applicant  since  July  2018.  (SOR
response)  He  said  Applicant  is “remorseful, repentant, and  stands  in  low  probability  of
improperly  using  any  PC  or  network  again.”  (Id.)  He  recommended  mitigation  of
Applicant’s issues. (Id.)
Applicant  described  himself  as  patriotic  and  loyal  to  the  government.  (Tr.  77)
