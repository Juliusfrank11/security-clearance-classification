Applicant, age 35, is married without children. She earned a bachelor’s degree in
2006  from  one  university  and  a  master’s  degree  in  2012  from  another  university.  She
has  been  steadily  employed  full  time  in  her  chosen  field  as  a  senior  consultant  since
2012 by two different employers.1 She has worked for her current employer since 2018.
She  was  granted  a  DOD  security  clearance  in  2007  when  she  worked  for  another
employer. The status of that clearance was not addressed in the record.
The  SOR  alleged  11  student-loan  debts,  including  four  federal  loans  totaling
$51,959 and seven unspecified loans totaling $231,047. It also alleged a $134 medical
debt.  Applicant  admitted  each  of  the  student-loan  debt  allegations.  She  denied  the
medical  debt  allegation  on  the  basis  that  it  had  been  “paid  in  full”  on  an  unspecified
date. She provided a confirmation number for her payment, but was awaiting receipt of
a  letter  from  the  creditor  to  prove  the  payment.  Each  of  the  alleged  debts  were
confirmed by a 2019 credit report. (Item 2; Item 4 at 2; Item 5)
Applicant  attributed  defaulting  on  her  student  loans  to  underemployment.  She
took on significant student-loan debt in 2002 to pay for college and again in 2010 to pay
1  Although  the  start  date  for  her  first  field-related  employment  is  listed  as  October  2010  in  her  SCA,  it
appears to be a typographical error. I have assumed a start date of October 2012 based on other record
information. (Item 3 at 14)
for graduate school. She asserted that student loans were her only option to pursue her
degrees. In March 2019, she described her financial situation as “improving.” In August
2019,  she  described  her  salary  as  sufficient  to  enable  her  to  “work  towards  restoring
[her]  financial  situation.”  The  record  did  not  specify  details  concerning  her  relevant
income  and  expense  history  beyond  the  information  alleged  in  the  SOR  and  the
information  regarding  Applicant’s  loan  repayment  history.  In  November  2017,  she
reported that her adjusted gross income was $61,551. In November 2019, although she
held  the  same  job  title,  she  worked  in  a  higher position  with  a  significantly  higher  (but
unspecified) salary than what she earned in 2017. (FORM response; AE B; Item 2; Item
4 at 2)
Applicant  tried  to  negotiate  a  loan  consolidation  for  her  student  loans  in  2017.
However, she was unsuccessful because several loans were not eligible for the income-
based repayment plan she requested and were “difficult for her to repay.” She continued
to work with her loan service providers to repay her student loans. At times, her loans
were  placed  in  deferment  status,  but  they  still  accrued  compound  interest.  At  other
times,  she  made  minimum  monthly  payments.  When  able,  she  paid  more  than  the
minimum. Through documentary evidence, she proved the payments she made from at
least April 2017 through January 2020 to two student-loan service providers, one for the
federal  loans  (Provider  A)  and  one  for  the  unspecified  loans  (Provider  B).  (FORM
response; AE A, B, C, D; Item 2; Item 3 at 43-46; Item 4 at 2-3)
From April 2017 through April 2019, before the SOR was issued, Applicant made
16 payments totaling $14,031 to Provider A including: two payments totaling $2,252 in
April 2017; five monthly payments of $419 from September 2017 through January 2018;
seven  monthly  payments  from  February  2018  through  June  2018,  of  which  five  were
$455,  and  two  totaled  $2,320;  a  $357  payment  in  July  2018;  and  a  $191  payment  in
April  2019.  Applicant  made  five  consecutive  monthly  payments  of  $908,  as  part  of  a
loan  rehabilitation  program,  to  Provider  A  from  August  2019  through  December  2019.
From  January  2019  through  January  2020,  she  made  24  consecutive  bi-monthly
payments,  12  of  which  occurred  before  the  SOR  was  issued,  to  Provider  B  totaling
$16,690, which included: 10 monthly payments of $1,417; one monthly payment totaling
$892; and one monthly payment totaling $1,628. (FORM response; AE A, B, C, D; Item
2; Item 3 at 43-46; Item 4 at 2-3)
In  her  SOR  response,  Applicant  expressed  that  she  understood  the  security
concerns surrounding financial health. She considers herself a patriot with a deep love
for her country. She has served in AmeriCorps. She asserted that she would never do
anything to compromise the security of the United States. She continues to work hard to
repay  her  student  loans  in  full  and  believes  that  her  hard  work  will  pay  off.  Her  2019
credit  report  revealed  no  new  delinquent  debts  and  two  credit-card  accounts  in  good
standing  with  no  reported  delinquencies  over  a  60  day  period.  It  also  revealed  an
unalleged  student-loan  collection  account  that  was  paid;  and  an  open  $17,949 federal
student-loan  account  with  a  $143  per  month  payment  in  good  standing  with  no
delinquencies reported over a 30 day period. (Item 2; Item 4 at 2; Item 5)
