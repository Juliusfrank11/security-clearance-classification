Applicant  is  a  51-year-old  quality  inspector  who  has  worked  for  a  defense
contractor since June 2018 and seeks to obtain a security clearance. His current annual
salary is approximately $110,000. (Tr. 47) He married in 2007 and was divorced in May
2019. (SOR Response) He has two children ages 25 and 20 and two stepchildren ages
23 and 25. (Tr. 16) He has no child support obligation. (Tr. 34) He is currently living with
his parents to save on expenses. (Tr. 25)
The SOR alleges a $72,574 student loan collection account (SOR 1.b); a $3,509
telephone service collection account (SOR 1.c); a $1,092 credit card collection debt (SOR
1.d);  an  $833  bank  credit  card  collection  account  (SOR  1.e);  and  a  $155  bank  card
account (SOR  1.f) in  collection.  The  four  debts,  other  than the  student loan  obligation,
total approximately $5,500. He has not made any payments on these four debts. (Tr. 28)
At  the  time  of  his  September  2018  enhanced  subject  interview,  he  had  no information
about these debts and speculated that they might have been joint credit cards he shared
with his wife. At the time of his subject interview he was arguing with his wife as to who
was responsible for a telephone collection debt (SOR 1.c, $3,509). (Ex. 2, Tr. 107) The
debt became so large because his then wife had used the account to purchase a number
of new cell phones. (Tr. 108) He admitted all of the debts in the SOR except for a $155
collection debt (SOR 1.f). That account was removed from his credit record by the credit
reporting agencies after he challenged the debt. (Ex. G, Tr. 26)
In July 2014, Applicant and his then wife filed for Chapter 13, Wage Earner’s Plan,
(SOR 1.a) bankruptcy protection. (Ex. 5) The action was taken in an attempt to save his
home  from  foreclosure  and  to  address  delinquent  obligations  due  to  periods  of
unemployment  and  an  employment  strike  that  he  had  experienced.  (Tr.  107).  He  had
been laid off three times and then in 2012, the company experienced a 10-week strike.
(Tr. 29) The bankruptcy listed $200,000 in assets and $345,000 in liabilities. (Ex. 5, page
42) His home represented $168,500 of the assets and $129,000 of the liabilities. (Ex 5,
page 18 and 21) Liabilities included $131,072 in student loans, which included his wife’s
student loans. (Ex. 5, page 43) At the time of filing, Applicant and his wife’s combined
annual income was $108,000. (Ex. 5, page 63)
Applicant’s Chapter 13 plan required $350 payments for the first six months and
then  $1,075  monthly  for  54  months.  The  plan,  if  completed,  would  repay  the  creditors
$60,150. (Ex. 5, page 72). (Tr. 32) In October 2017, the bankruptcy was dismissed. (Ex.
5, page 76) Applicant asserted he had been current on his monthly Chapter 13 payments
until he moved to Australia  after separating from his wife. (Tr. 30) He lived in Australia
from June 2017 through March 2018. (Tr. 24) Following the dismissal of the bankruptcy,
he made no payments on the obligations listed in the bankruptcy. (Tr. 59) He was required
to  obtain  financial  counseling  as  part  of  the  bankruptcy  proceedings.  (Tr.  105)  No
information  was  provided  as  to  what  he  learned  in  the  counseling  or  the  nature of  the
counseling.
As reflected in Applicant’s June 2018 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations
Processing (e-QIP), he claimed that $276 weekly was being withheld from his paycheck
due to a court-ordered Chapter 13 bankruptcy garnishment. (Ex 1) It was not explained
why there was a Chapter 13 garnishment when the bankruptcy had been dismissed in
October 2017. (Ex. 5, page 3 and 76)
Applicant asserted there is $70,000 equity in his home, which was purchased in
July 2005. (Tr. 24, 53) During the marital separation, while Applicant was in Australia, his
wife  made  a  very  few  monthly  payments  on  the  home.  (Tr.  24)  The  home  went  into
foreclosure,  but  was  brought  out  of  foreclosure  before  it  was  sold.  (Tr.  52)  During  the
bankruptcy proceeding, the real property could not be divided in the divorce. (Tr. 45) He
purchased his wife’s equity in the home. (Tr. 77) Following his divorce, the home was not
in  a  saleable  condition.  (Tr.  68)  Applicant  has  been  renovating  the  family  home  and
intends to turn it into a rental property. (Tr. 23) Documents presented show Applicant has
spent $21,900 repairing the home. (Ex. D, Ex. E, Ex. G) He spends most of his disposable
income on the renovation, which is nearly complete. (Tr. 28) In May 2019, he  resumed
making payments on the mortgage. (Tr. 52) Applicant is current on his $1,653 monthly
mortgage payments on the property he is renovating. (Ex. B, Ex. C, Tr. 21)
Applicant  obtained  student  loans  from  1992  through  1994.  (Tr.  20)  Prior  to  the
bankruptcy filing, Applicant asserts he made payments on his student loans, but stated
there  were  also  periods  of  deferments,  forbearances,  and  non-payment.  (Tr.  54)  As  of
January  10,  2020,  he  was  paying  $185.80  every  two  weeks  per  court-ordered
garnishment to address his $72,000 student loan obligation. ((Ex. A, Tr. 19, Tr. 27, and
Tr. 55) The garnishment went into effect in late 2019, and his pay statement shows that
only two payments totaling $369.93 had been made as of the hearing. (Ex. A, Ex. 56)
In  October  2005,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Aggravated  Sexual  Assault  on  a
child, a first degree felony. (Ex. 3, page 19, Ex. 4) It had been alleged he had touched his
girlfriend’s daughter’s private areas while bathing the child, then 10 years old. (Tr. 89) He
and the girl’s mother were living together at the time. Applicant denies any inappropriate
conduct and asserts the girl was old enough to bathe herself. (Tr. 92) After a few months
in therapy,  the  girl admitted  to  her  therapist  that  she  not been  molested. (Ex.  97)  This
information  was  brought  to  the attention  of  the  prosecution.  In  March  2007,  the  action
against  Applicant  was  dismissed  by  the  state,  citing  “Other,  Specify:  In  the  interest  of
justice.” (Ex. 3, page 40)
At the hearing, it was suggested Applicant might want to send documentation as
to  the  current  status  and  any  payments  made  on  his  delinquent  obligations.  (Tr.  109)
Information was received challenging the $155 bank card disputing on this credit report.
(Ex.  G).  No  documentation  related  to  the  other  delinquent  accounts  was  received
following the hearing.
