Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, except ¶ 1.c, which he denied. After
a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is 53  years old.  He  served  in  the military  from  1985  to 1992  and  was
honorably  discharged.  He  earned a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2002.  In 2003,  he  started an
insurance business and was self-employment. He married in 2006 and divorced in 2013.
He has two children from the marriage, ages 12 and 11 years old. He also has a 23 year
old child from a previous relationship, age 23 years old.. He remarried in 2018.
Applicant worked full time as an insurance agent from March 2003 until November
2013. His business failed, and he sought other employment. He worked from November
2013  to October 2014  at  two  places of  employment, but  was  underemployed.  He  was
then unemployed from October 2014 to September 2018. He was supported financially
by  his  wife’s  income  and  personal  savings.  He  began  employment  with  a  federal
contractor in 2018. (Item 3)
Applicant admitted in the SOR that he failed to file, as required, his Federal income
tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2017. He admitted he was indebted to the Federal
Government for delinquent taxes in the amount of approximately $148,000 for tax years
2008 through 2012. (Item 2)
In his November 2018 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed
that he also failed to pay his 2009 Federal income taxes because he did not have enough
money  from  sales  commissions,  and  he  did  not  have  taxes  withheld  from  previous
commissions. He stated  in the SCA that he was engaging a tax relief firm to begin an
offer in compromise (OIC) with the IRS for his 2009 and 2010 tax debt. He estimated he
owed $28,000 for tax year 2009 and $37,000 for 2010. IRS documents show that he owed
approximately $69,968 for tax year 2009. They also show he had not filed tax returns for
2010 through 2017. He filed his 2018 Federal tax return about a week late and the refund
he received was involuntarily applied to a 2005 tax debt. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2004. The documents show he had a debt
owed  to  the  IRS  for  tax  year  2003  for  approximately  $6,199.  He  filed  Chapter  13
bankruptcy in 2006 and disclosed he owed $42,710 in delinquent taxes for tax years 2003
through 2005. Both bankruptcies were dismissed prior to completion. In 2009, Applicant
filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy and it was discharged later that year. There is no indication he
was relieved of his tax obligations from the bankruptcy discharge. (Items 5, 6) (I have not
considered  any  derogatory  information  not  alleged  for  disqualifying  purposes.  I  may
consider  such  information  for  making  a  credibility  determination,  in  applying  mitigating
conditions, and in my whole-person analysis.)
In his SCA, Applicant also stated that he now had a steady job and no longer was
working on commissioned-based insurance sales. He increased his withholdings at his
current job and believed he was on a “path back to good graces with the IRS.” (Item 3)
He  said,  “Before  I  started  the  insurance  business  I  had  never  missed  any  filings  or
payments  of  my  federal  and  property  taxes.  I  simply  did  not  realize  how  commission
based earnings affected taxes.” (Item 3) He further stated, regarding his 2011 and 2012
tax returns, that he was working with a tax relief firm to get them filed and paid. (Item 3)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in January 2019. During
his interview he confirmed that he had not filed or paid any taxes from 2009 to the present.
He also stated that he was not required to file  income tax returns since tax year 2013,
because he did not earn enough money. Applicant has not provided any evidence that he
was not required to file Federal income tax returns based on his limited income. (Item 4)
Applicant told the investigator that he had not yet contracted with a tax relief firm
as he previously stated in his SCA. He said he may eventually use one, but he first needed
to research the best way to address his tax issue and then choose the right company. He
confirmed that he was not on a payment plan with the IRS for his delinquent taxes and
estimated he owed approximately $128,000 for tax years 2009 through 2012. He told the
investigator he failed to pay his Federal taxes from 2009 through 2012, because he did
not have enough money set aside to pay them when they were due. Instead, his earnings
were invested in his business. (Item 4)
Applicant disclosed in his SCA that he failed to file his 2010 Federal income tax
return because he was unemployed and no taxes were withheld from his income, and he
could  not  afford  to  pay  his  taxes.  He  estimated  he  owed  about  $37,000.  For his  2011
Federal income taxes, he said his failure to file was because he had medical and health
issues  and  was  “frozen  from  fear from  dealing  with  the  IRS  at  this  point.”  (Item  4)  He
estimated he owed about $35,000. For his 2012 Federal income tax returns, he explained
he did not file because he separated from his wife and was going through a divorce. He
was aware he would have to negotiate a settlement with the IRS at some point. (Items 3,
4)
Applicant  completed  Government  interrogatories  in  July  2019.  In  them  he
disclosed he also owed Federal income taxes for tax year 2008 ($20,000). He confirmed
he had not filed Federal tax returns for 2013 through 2017 and provided no evidence to
corroborate he was not required to do so. He stated, “2014 through 2017 I don’t believe I
earned  enough  to  file  returns.  I  am  requesting  transcripts  to  get  more  accurate
information. I filed my first clean return since 2008 this year and [the] IRS kept my refund
of [$]1,300 so technically repayment has begun.” (Item 4)
Regarding the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c, Applicant told the investigator that this collection
account is for a vehicle that he financed and subsequently wrecked and totaled. He was
behind on payments at the time of the accident. His insurance paid the creditor, but the
creditor was still pursuing Applicant for the late payments owed. Applicant disagreed with
the manner in which the debt is being handled by the creditor, and he has no intention of
paying it. No evidence was provided to show he has disputed the debt. It is unresolved.
(Items 2, 4, 8, 9)
Applicant  admitted  owing  the  accounts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  through  1.h.  They  are
corroborated  by  credit  reports dated  December 2018 and  May  2019.  Applicant  did not
provide evidence that he has paid, has payment plans, or otherwise resolved these debts.
