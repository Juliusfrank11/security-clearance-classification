Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant did not timely file her
state income tax returns (SOR 1.a) or her federal income tax returns (SOR 1.b) for the
2011  through  2018  tax  years.  In  response,  Applicant  admitted  both  allegations  and
provided information showing that her state and federal returns for those years were filed
in  September  2019.  (Answer)  In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by  Applicant’s
admissions, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 50 years old and works in an information technology (IT) position for
a  defense  contractor.  She  was  hired  by  her  current  employer  in  February  2020  after
working for two years at a different company that sponsored this request for a security
clearance. Applicant has worked in the IT industry since 1993. She has associate’s and
bachelor’s  degrees  in  IT-related  fields.  She  enjoys  an  excellent  reputation  in  the
workplace,  and  a fellow Marine  who has known Applicant  for  25 years  regards  her  as
trustworthy, hardworking, and of high integrity. (GX 1; GX 2; AX A; AX B)
Applicant served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps between 1993
and 1997. Thereafter, she served part time in the Army National Guard and Reserve until
retiring in 2018. Applicant first received a security clearance as part of her military duties
in 1994. (GX 1; GX 2; AX A)
As alleged in the SOR, and as she disclosed in her e-QIP, Applicant did not timely
file her state and federal income tax returns for eight consecutive years starting in 2012
with her 2011 taxes. Applicant averred that in 2012, she was forgetful and had difficulty
concentrating  due  to  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  and  other  unspecified
personal  problems.  In  early  2013,  when  she  was  required  to  file  her  2012  income  tax
returns, she realized she could not do so until her past-due 2011 returns were filed. As a
result, Applicant put off filing her 2012 returns. Applicant continued to not file her returns
for the next seven years because her procrastination “snowballed” into an overwhelming
circumstance. (Answer; GX 1 – 3; Tr. 23 – 25, 30 – 31)
In July 2019, Applicant began the process of resolving her past-due returns and
unpaid taxes. In September 2019, her state and federal income tax returns for the 2011
through 2018 tax years were filed. Applicant timely filed her 2019 state and federal income
tax returns in March 2020. She received refunds for some of the tax years at issue, and
she owed additional taxes for other years. All refunds have been issued and all of her
past-due taxes have been paid. (Answer; GX 2; AX B; Tr. 28 – 29)
To resolve her delinquent tax filing obligations, Applicant enlisted the services of a
nationally-known  tax  preparation  company.  She  had  previously  used  that  company  up
until 2011, when she last filed her tax returns as required. Applicant was aware at all times
over  the  last  nine  years  that  she  could  have  used  that  company  to  file  her  past-due
returns. (Tr. 31)
