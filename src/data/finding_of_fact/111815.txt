Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, except the allegation in ¶ 1.d. After
a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 60 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2007 and a master’s
degree in 2014. He never married and has no children. He was employed  by a federal
contractor from August 2011 to August 2017. He was then unemployed from August 2017
to November 2017. He worked one week in November 2017 for a federal agency and left
because it  failed  to  disclose  the  parking  requirements  and  costs.  He  was  unemployed
from November 2017 until he was hired by his current employer, a federal contractor in
April 2018. (Items 2, 3, 4)
The SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling approximately $40,971. Applicant
admitted  owing  all  but  the  debt  alleged in  SOR  ¶  1.d  (past  due  $740).  All  of  the  SOR
debts are corroborated by credit bureau reports dated May 2019 and April 2018. Applicant
was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  July  2018  and  August  2018.  He  was
confronted during the first interview with the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, which was past
due at the time. Applicant could not recall any delinquencies on any of his accounts. He
was given an opportunity to provide documentation regarding the delinquent account, but
did not do so during the first or subsequent interviews to corroborate his disagreement.
(Items 3, 4)
In Applicant’s August 2019 answer to the SOR, he attributed his financial problems
to having two knee surgeries in the past two and half years and a one-week hospital stay
for pneumonia. He stated that he has adequate health insurance from his employer, but
was liable for a portion of the surgeries and hospital stay that were deemed necessary by
his doctors. In 2018, he lost three months of work due to his surgery, which created a
financial  burden  for  him.  Working  overtime  was  not  available  until  approximately  April
2019. Applicant indicated that he is taking advantage of overtime opportunities, which he
sees as a long-term solution to him resolving his financial obligations. He indicated that
he will continue to pay his accounts.
Applicant stated in his SOR answer that the delinquent debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($25,739)
that became past due in April 2018, and charged off in June 2018, is no longer delinquent.
He provided a document from the collection division of the creditor  dated August 2019
that says a repayment agreement is confirmed, and Applicant agrees to make 49 monthly
payments of $514 with the final payment due in August 2023. The outstanding default will
continue to be reported to the credit bureaus until the agreement is satisfied. Collection
activities will continue if Applicant fails to fulfill the agreement. Applicant provided a letter
from the creditor dated July 27, 2019, authorizing a payment to be processed in July 2019.
Applicant  did  not  provide  any  other  documents  to  corroborate  he  has  made  any  other
payments and is in compliance with the agreement. (Item 2)
Applicant provided a letter from the creditor for the charged-off account alleged in
SOR ¶ 1.b ($9,862). It was dated August 2019 and stated: “Applicant is making payments
again  on  the  following  account.  Last  payment  processed  on  July  26,  2019.”  (Item  2)
Applicant did not provide any other documents to corroborate that he has continued to
make payments on this debt. (Item 2)
Applicant provided a settlement offer from the creditor for the charged-off account
in SOR ¶ 1.c ($3,283) dated July 2019. It stated that when Applicant completed payments
of $900, due in August 2019, and $650, due in September 2019, the debt will be settled
in full. Applicant did not provide any documents to show he paid these amounts and the
debt is settled. (Item 2)
Applicant provided a document from the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.d ($740 past due, with
a  total  balance  of $2,476). This  was  a  loan  from  2015.  Applicant  paid  the  debt in  July
2019. This debt is resolved. (Item 2)
Applicant  provided  a  payment  agreement  from  the  creditor  for  the  collection
account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e ($1,347). It required Applicant to make bi-monthly payments
of $336 in August and September 2019. The payments were to be received no later than
the  due  dates.  Applicant  did  not provide  documentary  evidence  to  corroborate  that  he
made the payments as required. (Item 2)
Applicant provided medical documents to substantiate his medical issues, but not
the specific amounts that he was required to pay that he stated impacted his finances. He
did  not  provide  any  information  regarding  his  current  finances,  such  as  his    income;
overtime pay; savings; investments; expenses; or other financial information to show he
has the ability to repay his debts. He did not disclose whether he maintains a budget or
has participated in financial counseling. He did not explain why he failed to contact his
creditors until after he received the SOR and was on notice that his finances might be an
issue when he was interviewed in July 2018.
