In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and
1.b.  He  did  not  expressly  admit  or deny  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.c  through  1.p.  In
response to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.n, he stated that the debts were settled,
but he did not provide any documentation of a settlement. In response to the allegations
in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.f-1.j, 1.m, 1.o, and 1.p, he stated that he would make an effort to
pay the debts. He did not respond to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.l. His answers
to the SOR are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 66-year-old custodian employed by a federal contractor since June
1998. He applied for a security clearance in June 1998, and it apparently was granted
and has been revalidated at least once since he was hired by his current employer.
Applicant attended an institute for the deaf and blind from about August 1960 to
May 1969 and then attended a trade school for about three years. He did not receive a
diploma or degree from either institution. (FORM Item 4 at 3.)
Applicant married in April 1984 and divorced in March 2010. He has lived with his
ex-wife since July 2016. He has a 33-year-old daughter, who assisted him in completing
his SCA and handles all his financial matters. (FORM Item 3 at 18; FORM Item 4 at 3-5.)
The  security  investigator  who  interviewed  Applicant  noted  that  he  did  not  understand
several of the concepts discussed during the interview. The investigator also noted that
Applicant cannot read, write, or type and has limited ability to use sign language. Applicant
told the investigator that he did not know what a credit report is, because his daughter
handles all his financial affairs. (FORM Item 4 at 5.)
Applicant and his wife filed a joint Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in January 2009
and  received  a  discharge  in  April  2009.  The  petition  listed  $21,094  in  secured  claims,
including two automobiles, and $41,133 in unsecured debts, including deficiencies after
two  repossessions  and  multiple  consumer  debts  and  credit-card  accounts.  The
bankruptcy is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a.
The SOR also alleges 15 delinquent debts totaling about $35,486  (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-
1.p). Applicant did not provide evidence that any of the debts have been resolved. In his
answer to the SOR, he promised to resolve 11 of the debts, but provided no evidence of
specific  actions  to  resolve  them.  During  the  interview  by  the  security  investigator  in
September 2018, he was unable to provide any specific information about the delinquent
debts  reflected  in  his  credit  reports.  Most  of  the  debts  became  delinquent  before  May
2016,  except  the  $70  medical  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.j,  which  became  delinquent  in
September 2018.
