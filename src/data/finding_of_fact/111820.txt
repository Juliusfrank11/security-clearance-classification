Applicant is  a  55-year-old employee  of a  defense  contractor. He  has worked  for
his  current  employer  since   about  October  2019.  He  served   on   active   duty   in  the   U.S.
military   from   1978   until  he   was  honorably   discharged   in  1982.  He  held  a   security
clearance   while   in  the   military   and   for  a   few   years  thereafter,   but  this  is  his  first
application   for  a   security   clearance   since   about  1986.  He   has   a   General  Educational
Development  (GED)   high   school   equivalency   certificate,   and   he   has  taken   graduate-
level classes from  a  prestigious university.  He is married  for the  third  time, but  he  and
his  wife   are  separated.  He   has  four   children.   (Transcript  (Tr.)   at  16-19,   22,  47-48;
Applicant’s response  to SOR,  Atch  A, C, D; GE  1, 2)
Applicant did not file  his federal and state income  tax returns when they were due
for tax  years 1995  through  1997  and  2009  through  2015, and  he  also  did not pay  all  the
taxes  for those  periods when  they  were due.  He worked  for a  car dealer in the  1990s,
and  he  stated  that he  thought he  had  filed  the  returns  for those  years. (Tr. at 30-31, 49-
50; Applicant’s response to  SOR;  GE 1-7)
Applicant worked as an independent contractor (IRS Form 1099) for a company
from 2002 through 2016.  He attributed his failure to file the returns from 2009 through
2016 to a series of events. His second wife kidnapped their two children in 2001. He did
not see either of his children for more than 15 years. He indicated that there is a federal
warrant  for  his  second  wife’s  arrest.  Applicant  also  suffered  from  serious  health
problems, including a stroke in 2003 and heart attacks in about 2009 and 2011. Finally,
the company he contracted for was financially unstable. It did not pay well, and it would
go  months without paying  what  it  owed  to  Applicant.  It also failed to  provide  Applicant
with the appropriate IRS Form 1099s that he felt that he needed to file the  tax returns.
He also admitted that he did not have the money to pay whatever taxes he owed. (Tr. at
22-30, 35-37, 56-60; Applicant’s response to SOR, Atch E; GE 1, 2)
Applicant stayed  with  the  company  far longer  than  he  should  have. The  company
went  bankrupt   in  2016   and   closed   its   business.  Applicant   stated   that  he   had   low   self-
esteem,  and  with  his health  issues, he  did  not have  the  confidence  to  seek another job.
He  also  stated   that   he   was  afraid   that   if   he   left,   he   would  never  receive   all   the   back
payments owed to him. (Tr. at  24-26, 54)
Applicant  decided  that  he  needed  to  rectify  his  tax  issues  in  about  2015.  He
contacted the IRS and his state taxation authority. He gathered his documents as best
he could, and he purchased the software to file the tax returns on his own.  He paid the
state $901 in 2015, which was applied to his 2010 taxes.  He reported his failure to file
state  tax  returns  and  that  he  owed  taxes  for  tax  years  2009  through  2011  on  a
Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  that  he  submitted  in  September
2016. (Tr. at 32-33, 40, 51, 55, 61; Applicant’s response to SOR, Atch G, H; GE 1)
Applicant  filed   his   1995   through   1997   state   and   federal  income   tax   returns   in
2017. It  is unclear if the  IRS  accepted  the  federal returns,  as the  IRS does not expect
individuals to  file  returns from  that long  ago.  Applicant paid  the  state  more than  $1,600
in 2018  to  pay  his tax  debt  in  full.  The  state  released  three  tax  liens  in 2018.  (Tr.  at 32-
36, 50-53; Applicant’s response to SOR, Atch  F, G; GE  6,  7)
The   IRS   prepared   substitute   tax   returns  for  tax   years  2009   through   2011.
Applicant filed  his 2009  through  2011  federal and  state  income  tax  returns  in  2017. He
filed  his 2012  through  2015  federal and  state  income  tax  returns in May  and  June  2019.
(Tr. at 32, 38;  Applicant’s response to  SOR;  GE 7)
Applicant  filed   his  2016   through   2019   federal  and   state   income   tax   returns  on
time.  The   IRS   transferred   $2,731  from   his refund  for 2016   to  his 2008  taxes. The   IRS
transferred  $4,666  from  his refund  for 2017  to  his  2009  taxes. He  paid the  IRS  $200  per
month  from  September 2019  to  January  2020, and  a  final payment  of  $170  in February
2020,  for  a   total  paid  of   $1,170.  Of   that  amount,  $31   went  to   his 2019   taxes,  and   the
rest  went to  pay  his 2012  and  2013  taxes. The  IRS  certified  that  he  does  not owe  any
additional taxes.  (Tr. at 41; Applicant’s response to  SOR, Atch  F-H;  GE  4-7; AE  A)
Applicant accepted  responsibility  for his poor judgment.  He has a  good  job  with  a
stable  income.  He   took  financial  management  courses.   His  finances  are  currently   in
good   shape,  and   he   is  aware  that  neglecting   his  tax   obligations   in  the   future   could
jeopardize  his security clearance  and  his job.  He credibly  stated  that he  has learned  a
valuable lesson,  and  all  future  tax  returns and  taxes will be  filed  and  paid on  time,  even
if   he   does  not  receive   a   security   clearance.   (Tr.  at  38,  42-47,  60,  68-72;  Applicant’s
response to SOR, Atch H-J;  GE 3, 4)
Applicant  submitted   documents   and   letters  attesting   to   his   moral  character   and
excellent  job   performance.   He  is  praised   for  his  judgment,  discretion,  reliability,
dedication,  honesty,  trustworthiness,  patriotism,  and   integrity.  (Applicant’s  response   to
SOR, Atch B, D; AE  B)
