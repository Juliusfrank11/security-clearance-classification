In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted the SOR allegation in ¶ 1.a, and she

information. Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact.

The SOR alleges three delinquent debts totaling $33,645 as follows:
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  Applicant  has  a  debt  placed  for  collection  for  $33,001.
About 10 years ago, Applicant borrowed about $35,000 using a line of credit option on a
credit card to renovate her basement after it flooded. (Tr. 22, 30-32, 34, 64-65) She made
payments for a time, and then the creditor increased her interest rate without notifying
Applicant. (Tr. 22) The interest rate went from 4.9 percent to 27.9 percent. (Tr. 31) She
denied  that  she  missed  a  payment.  (Tr.  31-33)  The  creditor  was  unwilling  to  accept  a
payment for the amount of her previous payments. (Tr. 22) The creditor demanded a $900
monthly payment and would not accept a  $400 payment. (Tr. 22, 34, 36) The balance
was about $25,000 in August 2013. (Tr. 34-35) In November 2015, a collection agent took
over the account. (Tr. 37) She did not receive correspondence from the collection agent,
and she did not contact the collection agent. (Tr. 37-38, 52) In October 2019, Applicant
called the original creditor, and the original creditor told her the account is closed because
of the age of the debt. (Tr. 22, 37-38) Moreover, the creditor did not have a record of the
account. (Tr. 22, 37-38) She acknowledged she was responsible for the debt; she was
willing to pay it; and she simply did not know who to pay or how to pay it. (Tr. 42-43, 53)
After  the  hearing,  she  contacted  the  collection  agent,  and  on  January  27,  2020,  the
collection agent agreed to settle the debt for $8,500. (AE J) On January 27, 2020, she
paid the creditor $2,550, and on January 29, 2020, she paid the creditor $6,000. (AE K)
This debt is settled and resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c allege that Applicant has two delinquent medical accounts for
$251 and $393. Applicant said she paid both debts in 2018. (Tr. 43-44) On January 22,
2020, the creditor for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b wrote that on October 30, 2018, the debt was
“paid in full.” (AE I) On February 11, 2020, the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.c wrote that on October
30, 2018, the creditor received a payment for $393, and the debt was “PAID IN FULL.”
(AE H)

negative  entry,  and  that  negative  entry  relates  to  SOR  ¶  1.a.  (AE  E-AE  G;  GE  3)
Numerous accounts reflected a zero balance, paid, or otherwise successfully resolved.
Her January 20, 2020 credit report shows good credit scores. (Tr. 23; AE A)
