The SOR alleged that as of June 26, 2019, Applicant had not yet filed her federal
income tax returns for the 2015, 2016, and 2017 tax years (SOR 1.a); and that she owes
$2,857 for three delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.b – 1.d). In response to the SOR,
Applicant admitted SOR 1.a, but denied SOR 1.b – 1.d. With her response she provided
an explanatory statement and a credit report, dated July 26, 2019. (FORM, Items 1 and
3).  In  addition  to  the facts  established  by  Applicant’s admissions, I  make  the following
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  55-year-old  employee  of a defense  contractor,  for whom  she  has
worked, first as a temporary agency employee then as a permanent company employee,
since April 2012. She was unemployed between January 2010 and April 2012 after being
laid  off  due  to  a  reduction  in force from a  previous  employer.  Applicant  was  otherwise
steadily  employed  between  June  2000  and  January  2010.  She  attributes  the  debts
alleged in the SOR to her two years of unemployment. As to SOR 1.b, she averred that
the debt was not valid, that she disputed it (reason not specified), and  that it has been
removed from her credit history. As to SOR 1.c and 1.d, Applicant  stated that she has
resolved both debts through a repayment agreement with the collection agency to which
both credit card debts had been referred. (FORM, Items 1 and 3)
All three debts are documented in the credit reports produced by the Government.
The date of last activity or payment on those debts was in either September or October
2012. They  do not appear on  a  July  2019  credit  report provided  by  Applicant  with  her
Answer. In her response to the FORM, Applicant provided information that established
that the SOR 1.c and 1.d debts have been satisfied. She continued to rely on the absence
of the SOR 1.b debt from her credit history for the past two years to support her claim that
it  was  removed  for  being  invalid.  Generally,  the  absence  of  an  account  from  a  credit
report,  without  more,  is  not  sufficient  to  show  that  a  debt  has  been  resolved.  In  this
instance, in addition to Applicant’s claim about SOR 1.d, the record shows she acted to
resolve her other debts; however, the passage of more than seven years since the SOR
1.b debt became delinquent could also suggest it is no longer being reported due to the
Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) statute of limitations. (FORM, Items 3, 7, and 8)
When Applicant submitted her e-QIP in September 2017, she disclosed that she
had not yet filed her federal income tax return for the 2016 tax year because “I am behind
on paperwork. (Terrible excuse).” She further stated, “I will file within the next 30 days.”
In November 2018, Applicant was interviewed as part of her background investigation by
a government investigator. During the interview, she stated that she did not file her 2016
return because she had no reportable income. As discussed below, this was not true. She
also  acknowledged  that  she  knew  she  had  to  file  a  return  anyway.  In  April  2019,  in
response  to  interrogatories  about  her  taxes  from  the  DOD  CAF,  Applicant  provided
information that shows she had not yet filed her federal returns for the years alleged in
SOR 1.a. The same information showed her 2014 return was filed seven months late but
she did not timely file an extension when the return was first due. Also in response to the
interrogatories, Applicant stated her intention to file her past-due returns by July 2019.
(FORM, Items 4 – 6)
In  response  to  the  FORM,  Applicant  provided  copies  of  her  past-due  federal
income tax returns. They were signed on October 1, 2019. The IRS received the returns
on  November  19,  2019.  As  to  her  2016  return,  it  shows  she  earned  about  $50,000  in
reportable income that year. Applicant does not appear to owe any unpaid taxes for the
years at issue. She did not show that she has filed her 2018 return or if all of her state
income tax returns have been filed.
