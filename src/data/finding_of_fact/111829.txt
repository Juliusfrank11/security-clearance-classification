Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $106,920 for 19
delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a – 1.s). Twelve of the debts alleged (SOR 1.a –
1.k, 1.n) are for delinquent student loans totaling $97,238, or about 90 percent of the total
debt  at  issue.  In  response,  Applicant  admitted  with  brief  explanation  all  of  the  SOR
allegations.
At the hearing, additional relevant information was produced that showed Applicant
had not filed his state or federal income tax returns for the tax years 2015 through 2018.
(Tr. 58 – 59, 64 – 66) As provided for by Directive, Section E3.1.17, Department Counsel
moved to amend the SOR to conform to this new information by adding a new allegation
(SOR 1.t). The proposed amendment was presented as follows:
1.t You failed to timely file, as required, your federal and state income tax
returns  for  tax  years  2015,  2016,  2017,  and  2018.  As  of  the  date  of  this
amended Statement of Reasons, the tax returns remain unfiled. (Tr. 69)
Applicant did not object and I granted the motion. Additionally, he admitted the new
allegation,  and  I  left  the  record  open  for  16  days  so  that  Applicant  could  provide
information  in  response  to  SOR  1.t.  (Tr.  69  –  72)  As  noted  above,  Applicant  provided
three post-hearing exhibits. Only one of those exhibits, AX G, addresses the information
presented in SOR 1.t. In addition to the facts established by Applicant’s admissions to all
of the SOR allegations, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 33 years old and employed by a defense contractor in a position that
requires  eligibility  for  a  position  of  trust.  His  duties  in  an  information  technology  (IT)
position  includes  safeguarding  personally  identifiable  information  (PII)  and  access  to
sensitive facilities. Applicant has worked for his current employer since September 2018.
Between December 2006 and October 2017, he worked in a similar position for a large
telecommunications  company.  He  was  involuntarily  terminated  for  violating  company
policies, and he was unemployed until being hired for his current position. This is his first
request for position of trust eligibility. (GX 1; GX 4; Tr. 12, 41, 33)
Applicant  attended   college   between   2005   and   2009,  when   he   received   a
bachelor’s degree. He also attended  a  technical college  in 2011  and  2012. The  student
loans addressed  in the  SOR were obtained  to  pay  his tuition  at  both  colleges. He and  his
wife  have  been  married  since  2011. In  addition  to  her 12-year-old child  from  before the
marriage, they  have two children  together, ages 5  and  6.  Additionally, in 2014,  Applicant
and  his wife  were given  custody  of  his then  15-year-old cousin  who  had  been  sexually
molested  by  her mother’s boyfriend. The  child  joined  the  military  when  she  turned  18, but
now   has  left  the   service  and   is looking  for work. Applicant  and   his  wife   have   provided
sporadic  financial assistance to  her over the  past year or so.  (GX 1;  Tr. 25  –  30, 51  –  55,
59 –  61)
Since March 2019, Applicant’s wife has held both a full-time and a part-time job,
and she now earns about $72,000 annually. She was unemployed between January and
September 2014, between March and September 2015, and between May and December
2018. Her 2014 and 2015 periods of unemployment arose from medical problems related
to the birth of their two children. Her 2018 unemployment started when she was laid off
from a previous job. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 33 – 35, 51 – 55)
Applicant’s financial problems arose from a combination of circumstances. His two
children were born within 16 months of each other, and his wife was unable to work for
medical reasons for most of 2014 and 2015. His own unemployment between October
2017  and  September  2018  also  created  financial  burdens  that  he  struggled  to  carry.
Applicant  remained  in  good  standing  with  his  student  loans  until  about  April  2018;
however, both he and his wife found themselves unemployed for most of 2018.  In July
2019, he began the process of trying to resolve those debts and, since October 2019, has
been  making  monthly  payments  through  a  student-loan  rehabilitation  program.
Satisfactory participation in that program will bring his loans current. As of February 2020,
the total due, with interest and penalties, for all 12 accounts was $120,359. (GX 4; AX A;
AX B; Tr. 37 – 39, 55 – 56)
During  his  wife’s  unemployment  in  2014  and  2015,  Applicant  resorted  to  using
credit cards to make ends meet. He eventually became unable to pay those accounts as
required.  Between  2016  and  2018,  the  accounts  were  either  charged  off  as  business
losses or referred for collection. The debts alleged at SOR 1.l, 1.m, and 1.o – 1.s reflect
those  debts,  which  total  $9,682.  In  January  2019,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a
government  investigator  as  part  of  Applicant’s  background  investigation.  During  the
interview, he discussed all of the debts alleged in the SOR and stated that his intent to
resolve  his  debts  within  two  years  by  saving  money  and  reducing  expenses,  such  as
moving  his  children  from  private  school  to  public  school.  In  August  2019,  he  started
working  with  a  professional  financial  counselor  to  improve  his  finances.  He  has
established  a  monthly  budget  and  has  corrected  discrepancies  in  his  credit  history  to
increase his credit score; however, Applicant has not yet established a plan to repay or
otherwise  resolve  those  debts.  The  budget  he  submitted  post-hearing  does  not  reflect
any  debt  payments  other  than  his  student-loan  rehabilitation  payments.  Additionally,  it
reflects  a  negative  monthly  cash  flow  of  about  $100  after  deducting  expenses  from
Applicant’s  pay  alone.  He  earns  $43,000  annually.  With  his  wife’s  income,  the  total
household income is about $115,000 annually. It is unclear what access Applicant has to
his wife’s income  to  resolve  debts  and  to  pay unplanned  expenses.  Applicant  testified
that the net remainder each month is actually about $150. (Answer; GX 1 – 4; AX C; AX
F; AX G; Tr. 33 – 36, 43 – 48)
During  Applicant’s  testimony  about  the  state  of  his  current  monthly  finances,
Applicant  revealed  that  he  had  not filed  his federal or  state  income  tax  returns  for  the
2015 through the 2018 tax years. Applicant had not disclosed this information in his e-
QIP, and it was not discussed during his January 2019 interview. In July 2019, Applicant
and his wife (they have always filed joint returns)  started working with a tax-debt-relief
and tax-preparation company to resolve their past-due tax filings and any unpaid tax debt
that may result. Applicant did not present any additional information regarding the status
of his past-due returns. (AX G; Tr. 58 – 59, 64 – 67)
Applicant  has  a  good  reputation  in  the  workplace.  In  February  2020,  he  was
promoted on the strength of his job performance and professional expertise. (AX D; Tr.
33 – 36)
