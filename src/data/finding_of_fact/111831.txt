Applicant  admitted  to  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.~1.d.  He  denied  SOR
allegation  ¶  1.e.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and
testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  52-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  “for  over  30  years,”  and  has  held  a  security
clearance  for  those  30-plus  years.  (TR  at  page  19  line  18  to  page  21  line  4.)  He  is
recently divorced, and has three adult  children. (TR at page 21 line 14 to page 24 line
8.)  Applicant  attributes  his  financial  difficulties  to  his  divorce,  when  his  former  spouse
“walked  out”  of  their  marriage,  leaving  all  of  the  alleged  past-due  debts,  save  the  last
one, to Applicant. (TR at page 23 line 4 to page 24 line 5.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a. Applicant admits a former  past-due  credit-card  debt, incurred by his former
spouse without his knowledge, in the amount of about $30,000. (TR at page 28 line 17
to  page  30  line  21.)  Through  the  auspices  of  a  legal  mediator;  he  paid  this  debt  in
August  of  2020,  as  evidenced  by  documentation  from  this  legal  mediator  (AppX  F  at
page 2.)
1.b.  Applicant  admits  a  former,  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  B  in  the  amount  of
about $3,492. (TR at page 31 line 16 to page 32 line 21.) Through the auspices of the
same legal mediator noted above; he paid this debt in January of 2020, as evidenced by
documentation from this legal mediator (AppX F at page 2.)
1.c.  Applicant  admits  a  former,  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  C  in  the  amount  of
about  $4,648.  (TR at page  32  line 22  to  page  35  line  2.) Through  the  auspices  of  the
same legal mediator noted above; he paid this debt in November of 2018, as evidenced
by documentation from this legal mediator (AppX F at page 2.)
1.d.  Applicant  admits  a  past-due  debt  on  a  second  mortgage  in  the  amount  of
about $58,000. (TR at page 26 line 22 to page 27 line 4, and at page 34 line 20 to page
36 line 8.) Through the auspices of the same legal mediator noted above, Applicant is
making monthly payments of $1,824 towards this debt, which will be paid off on March
1, 2021. (TR at page 38 line 24 to page 39 line 9.) This is evidenced by documentation
from this legal mediator (AppX D.)
1.e.  Applicant  denies  his  ex-spouse’s  medical  debt  in  the  amount  of  about
$1,047. (TR at page 22 line 17 to page 34 line 19.) This debt also does not appear on
Applicant’s most recent October 2020 credit report. (GX 10.) I find that Applicant is not
responsible for this debt.
