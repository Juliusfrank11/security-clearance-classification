Applicant admitted  SOR ¶¶  1.a  –  1.d,  1.g – 1.l, and  1.n,  with  explanations,  and
denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.e,  1.f,  and  1.m,  with  explanations.  Applicant’s  admissions  are
incorporated or adopted herein as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.
Background Information
Applicant is a 53-year-old data collector employed by a defense contractor since
November  2007.  He  seeks  to  retain  his  secret  security  clearance,  which  is  a
requirement of his continued employment. (SOR Answer; Tr. 15-18, 58, 60; GE 1; AE 9,
AE 12)
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  May  1985.  He  was  awarded  an
associate’s  degree  in  criminal  justice  administration  in  May  1992,  and  a  bachelor  of
science degree in criminal justice in May 1999. (GE 1; Tr. 18-21) Applicant was married
from December 2005 to June 2010, and that marriage ended by divorce. He has a 15-
year-old daughter from his marriage, who lives  with his former spouse. Applicant pays
his former spouse $268 monthly for child support. (Tr. 25, 57-58; GE 1; AE 8, AE 13)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s  responsibility  for  the  14  delinquent  SOR  debts,  totaling  $23,987,  is
established  in  part  by  his  SOR  Answer;  his  May  2018,  May  2019,  and  October  2019
credit  reports;  his  December  11,  2018  Office  of  Personnel  Management  Personal
Subject  Interview  (OPM  PSI);  and  his  hearing  testimony.  At  the  hearing,  it  was
determined  that  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.e  were  duplicate  debts.  (SOR
Answer; Tr. 71-77; GE 2 – 5)
Applicant’s  financial  problems  originated  when  he  was  married  to  his  former
spouse. At that time, he was employed as a railroad conductor, owned a home, had two
paid-off automobiles, and had good credit. In 2007, at age 40, he had a heart attack. He
testified that his former spouse “actually started to max out everything (credit cards) like
as if she was leaving. . . [s]o shortly after, she filed for divorce and basically took most
of the house.” (Tr. 26-27, 28)
Applicant’s  divorce  and  ongoing  relationship  with  his  former  spouse  have  been
very contentious. (Tr. 24; AE 4) The divorce decree required, among other things,  that
Applicant’s  spouse  pay  him  $4,590  at  a  rate  of  at  least  $50  per  month  with  interest
accruing at the statutory rate until paid in full, to reimburse him for the SOR ¶ 1.a. debt,
discussed below. Applicant’s spouse was also required to pay him $945 as replacement
cost  of  items  of  clothing  she  wrongfully  sold,  destroyed,  or  disposed  of,  as  well  as
several other debts the court determined she was responsible for during their marriage.
Applicant’s spouse refused to honor her court-ordered debt payments, leaving Applicant
responsible. (SOR Answer; Tr. 31-32, 51; AE 1)
After the divorce, Applicant had visitation rights to see his daughter every week.
In  March  2018,  the  local  family  law  court  allowed  Applicant’s  former  spouse  and
daughter  to  relocate  to  another city  within  the  state. The modified  court  order  reduced
Applicant’s  visitation  rights  to  seeing  his  daughter  every  other  weekend.  He  also
incurred  visitation  travel  costs  and  the  court  increased  his  monthly  child  support
payments  because  his  spouse  moved  to  a  higher  cost  area.  (Tr. 54-55,  58,  60;  AE  5,
AE 10, AE 13)
In  February  2013,  Applicant  was  rear-ended,  with  his  daughter in  the  car,  in  an
automobile  accident  that  caused  him  to  be  out  of  work  for  approximately  five  months.
Between  2013  and  2017,  Applicant  was  in  and  out  of  the  hospital  for  surgeries  and
other ailments  such  as  valley  fever  and  thoracic  outlet  syndrome,  causing  him  to  play
catch  up  with  bills  and  child  support.  At  times,  he  was  able  to  receive  short-term
disability (STD) funds. (SOR Answer; Tr. 27-29, 32, 39-40, 61, 66-67; AE 2, AE 16, AE
26)
However,  if  his  savings  and  the  money  he  received  from  STD  did  not  cover
medical bills or child support, he would borrow money from his parents, to stay current.
Moreover,  on  the  rare  occasion  he  had  a  child  support  arrearage,  the  arrearage  was
automatically taken out of the following year’s income tax refund. Applicant has always
made  paying  child  support  a  priority  and  is  current  on  his  child  support  obligations.
(SOR Answer; Tr. 55-57, 67; GE 2; AE 7, AE 27)
In  addition  to  Applicant’s  own  medical  problems,  his  daughter  was  diagnosed
with  scoliosis  in  2018.  Per  his  divorce  decree,  he  pays  for  his  daughter’s  medical
insurance  and  55%  of  her  uncovered  medical  bills.  Applicant  believes  some  of  the
medical  bills  discussed  below  pertain  to  his  daughter.  His  former  spouse  does  not
inform him  of  their  daughter’s  medical  bills  when  they  are  incurred,  and  he  typically  is
not aware of them until they are delinquent. Because of these various medical issues,
“[a]ll  the  medical  bills  started  racking  up.”  Applicant  summed  up  his  position,  “I  was
overwhelmed by . . . medical bills.” In addition, as recently as November 2019, Applicant
hit a tire while driving on the freeway that  damaged his automobile and caused him to
sustain soft tissue damage. This accident  caused Applicant to lose two weeks of work
and  he  was  required  to  pay  for  uncovered  automobile  repairs  and  medical  treatment.
(Tr. 29-31, 34, 51-55, 58-60, 62-65, 71-77; AE 1, AE 2, AE 3, AE 6, AE 11, AE 19 – AE
22)
The following is a summary of Applicant’s SOR debts and their status:
SOR  ¶  1.a  -  $11,323  charged-off  credit  card  debt.  Applicant’s  former  spouse
incurred this debt while she was married to Applicant before filing for divorce. Applicant
settled  this account for $3,397  and  paid the amount  in full  on  December 27, 2019. As
noted,  his former  spouse  was  required  to  reimburse  him  $4,590  for  her  portion  of  this
debt  plus  interest.  To  enforce  this debt  and  the  $945  discussed  above,  Applicant  was
required to file two post-decree judgment requests after his divorce was final. Applicant
was ultimately successful in collecting $2,090 from his former spouse that he received
in  three  separate  payments  in  January  and  February  2020.  (SOR  Answer;  Tr.  34-38,
61-62, 65; AE 14, AE 15, AE 18, AE 23, AE 24) DEBT RESOLVED.
SOR  ¶¶  1.b  –  1.n.  The  remaining  13  SOR  debts  are  all  delinquent  medical
accounts: 1.b - $956; 1.c - $930; 1.d - $704; 1.e - $704 (duplicate of 1.d); 1.f - $613; 1.g
- $483; 1.h - $437; 1.i - $362; 1.j - $323; 1.k - $234; 1.l - $50; 1.m – $1,302; and 1.n -
$5,566  (settled  for  $2,784  and  paid  in  full).  Post-hearing,  Applicant  provided
documentation showing that he has made payment arrangements to resolve all of these
debts, with the exception of 1.n, which is settled and paid in full. (Tr. 38-51; 68-72, AE
28,  AE  30)  DEBTS  BEING  RESOLVED  EXCEPT  FOR  SOR  ¶  1.N  WHICH  IS
RESOLVED.
Post-hearing, Applicant consulted a financial counselor, who provided him with a
strategy  on  how  to  pay  off  or  pay  down  his  delinquent  medical  accounts.  Applicant
followed the counselor’s advice and, as demonstrated by his post-hearing evidence, he
is  on  a  path  to  regain  financial  responsibility.  (Tr.  67,  78-79,  80-83;  AE  28)  Applicant
also  submitted  a  budget  that  reflects  a  gross  monthly  income  of  $2,217,  with  a  net
monthly  remainder  of  $418.  His  budget  further  reflects  that  he  maintains  a  modest
lifestyle  and  lives  within  his  means.  Applicant  is  current  on  his  mortgage  and  other
debts. (Tr. 66-68, 79-80; AE 25, AE 29)
Character Evidence
Applicant  submitted  two  character  letters,  one  from  his  supervisor  and  the
second  from  a  coworker.  His  supervisor  described  him  as  a  model  employee,
hardworking, sincere, and reliable. Applicant’s supervisor has known him for a lengthy
period and is familiar with his clearance financial issues. Applicant’s coworker described
him  as  the  first  to  offer  assistance,  responsible,  and  considerate.  Both  individuals
recommend and support continuation of Applicant’s clearance. (Tr. 61-62; AE 17)
