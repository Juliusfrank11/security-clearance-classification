Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, through 1.e. He denied SOR
allegations  ¶¶  1.f.  and  1.g.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,
exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  35-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  page  7,
and TR at page 16 lines 5~6.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since
August of 2018. (GX 1 at page 19.) Applicant was born in the United States; but as a
child,  he was  taken to  Taiwan by  his  Taiwanese parents. (GX  1 at  page 7,  and TR  at
page 16 line 7 to page 18 line 2.) He returned to the United States in 2016, has received
a Master’s Degree from an American university, and is pursuing a Ph.D. from that same
university.  (TR  at  page  18  line  3  to  page  24  line  9.)    He  is  married,  and  has  one
American born child, age 2. GX 1 at page 38.)
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a. Applicant’s parents are citizens and residents of Taiwan. (TR at page 25 line
6 to page 30 line 21.) However, “they have been separated for more than 30 year.” (Id.)
His mother is a retired nurse, having been retired “for more than 20 years.” (TR at page
25 line 10 to page 26 line 10.) She never worked for the Taiwanese government, and he
contacts her only about “four times a year.” (TR at page 25 line 6 to page 30 line 21.)
Applicant’s  father  is  “a  dentist.”  (TR  at  page  26  lines  11~19.)  Apart  from  his
mandatory  military  service,  Applicant’s  father  had  no  connection  with  the  Taiwanese
government.  (TR  at  page  25  line  6  to  page  30  line  21.)  He  contacts  his  father  about
“once every year.” (TR at page 29 lines 7~18.)
1.b.  Applicant’s two sisters are citizens and residents of Taiwan. (TR at page 30
line 22 to page 34 line 6.) His oldest sister has mental health issues, and his youngest
sister is a veterinarian. (Id, and at page 71 lines 15~17.) Applicant has little contact with
his oldest sister, and only about four times a year with his youngest sister. (TR at page
30  line  22  to  page  34  line  6.)  Neither  sister  has  any  connection  with  the  Taiwanese
government.
1.c.  Applicant’s  mother-in-law  and  father-in-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Taiwan. (TR at page 34 line 11 to page 36 line 3.) His mother-in-law is “a cook,” and his
father-in-law is “retired.” (TR at page 71 lines 18~25.)  Through  his  wife,  Applicant  has
contact with these in-laws about  four times a year. (TR at page 34 line 11 to page 36
line 3.)
1.d.   Applicant’s sister-in-law is citizens and resident of Taiwan. (TR at page 37
line 7 to page 39 line 8.) She is a “full-time mother,” and their contact is limited to about
twice a year. (Id, and TR at page 72 at lines 1~3.)
1.e. Applicant maintains contact, about once or twice a year, with friends who are
citizens of Taiwan, but for the most part reside in the United States. (TR at page 37 line
7 to page 39 line 8.)  None are affiliated with the Taiwanese government, and he met
them through his university schooling in the United States. (Id.)
1.f.  Applicant  denies  that  he  owns  any  real  property  in  Taiwan.  He  transferred
ownership to his wife, who is in the process of selling said property. (TR at page 39 line
9 to page 43 line 13, at page 54 lines 7~16, and AppX A and B.) Furthermore, they are
in  the  process  of  purchasing  real  property  in  the  United  States,  as  evidenced  by
documentation. (AppXs V and W.)
1.g. Applicant denies that he has two bank accounts in Taiwan, valued at about
$50,000.  He  has  transferred  said  funds  to  the  United  States,  as  evidenced  by
documentation to that end. (TR at page 43 line 14 to page 45 line 21, and AppXs C, D,
E~I.)
Notice
I  take  administrative  notice  as  to  certain  facts  regarding  Taiwan:  The  United
States  recognizes  Taiwan  as  part  of  the  Peoples  Republic  of  China.  It  perpetrates
economic espionage.
