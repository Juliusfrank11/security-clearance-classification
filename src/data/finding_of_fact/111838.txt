Applicant  is  a  35-year-old  married  woman  with  one  child,  age  14.  A  previous
marriage ended in divorce in 2018. She earned an associate’s degree in April 2012, and is
currently working as a customer service team lead. (Item 3)
The SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts totaling approximately $29,330. Applicant
admits all of the allegations, contending that she first fell behind on her debts in 2013 after
she  financed  the  purchase  of  a  car  with  a  high  interest  rate  loan.  (Item  4  at  54)  The
monthly loan payments proved to be higher than anticipated. Shortly after purchasing the
car,  Applicant’s  son  required  unexpected  medical  treatment,  which  generated  more
expenses. Consequently, she began falling behind on her debts. By June 2019, she had
incurred  17  debts,  totaling  $29,330.  (Item  2)  She  asserts  that  she  is  making  monthly
payments towards the satisfaction of subparagraphs 1.c, 1.h, 1.k through 1.o, and 1.q. She
provided no evidence supporting her assertion, nor did she did elaborate on the current
status of the remaining SOR debts.
