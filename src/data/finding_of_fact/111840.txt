Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.d,  and  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.e  and  1.f,  all  with
explanations. I incorporate his admissions and explanations into the findings of fact. After
a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  the  record  evidence,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 33 years old. He has been married twice. He was married for less than
a year in 2008-2009. He remarried in 2012, but he and his second wife soon separated.
Their divorce became final in January 2015. He has no children. (Tr. 42-43, 80-82, 84-
86; GE 1; AE C; AE K)
Applicant graduated from high school in 2006. He spent about 20 months in the
Army (2008-2009) before he was honorably discharged after a service-related injury, with
60% disability. (Tr. 30, 49-50, 82-83; AE P) Between 2009 and 2012, he held several jobs
as a security officer. (Tr. 36; AE D, AE Q)
Applicant testified that he was working long hours, with low pay. (Tr. 30-32) This
led him to decide to earn his commercial driver’s license (CDL), which he hoped would
lead to better income. He financed his training himself. (Tr. 50; AE D, AE Q)
Applicant was an independent truck driver for about two years, from 2012 to 2014.
His truck broke down several times, which led to increased expenses and lower income.
At one point, he was stranded in a city far from his home state for several months. He left
that  position  in  December  2013.  He  was  terminated  from  his  next  trucking  job,  per
company policy, after he was in an accident in the middle of the night, in September 2014.
(GE 1; Tr. 31-32, 53-55, 78-79) Applicant was not making much income, and his truck
driving  job  took  him  far  from  home.  The  marriage  quickly  foundered  and  Applicant  fell
behind on his debts. After their marriage failed, they sold the home. (Tr. 31-32, 35-36)
Applicant then worked as a technician for a telecom company from October 2014
to August 2015. From fall 2015 to spring 2017, he returned to school, earning associate’s
degrees in cyber security. (AE D, AE Q) He was then unemployed from May to November
2017. He submitted his SCA in November 2017 for his current clearance sponsor. He has
worked on unclassified assignments but his full employment has been “on hold” pending
resolution of his clearance eligibility. (Tr. 68-69; GE 1 at 14) Since then he held several
jobs in the defense industry, in his field of cyber security. (AE V, AE W, Tr. 102-110) In
the meantime, he is doing contract work as a satellite technician. (Tr. 94-95)
Applicant  earned  very  little  income  in  2014  and  2015.  His  tax  returns  reflect
adjusted gross income of less than $10,000 each year. (AE S, AE T, AE U) From 2015 to
2017 he was in school, not making much money. (Tr. 98-99) Since then, his income has
improved.  A  2018  tax  return  shows  income  of  about  $34,000.  (AE  V)  He  had  multiple
employers in 2019, both in the defense industry and with the satellite company. His W-2
forms show a combined income of about $42,400. (AE W)
The  six  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  total  $18,585.  They  are  established  by  credit
reports from January 2018 and April 2019. (GE 2, GE 3) Applicant disclosed two past-
due debts on his SCA. (GE 1)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($6,235) and 1.b ($5,125) are charged-off debts to a credit union. After
they  married  in  2012,  Applicant  and  his  second  wife  moved  into  a  new  home.  These
accounts were for furniture and home improvements. Applicant fell behind on these and
other accounts because his priority was to save the home from foreclosure. (Answer; Tr.
31-32, 48-49, 53-56, 86) The debts have now been settled and paid. (AE G, AE H, AE I)
SOR  ¶  1.c  ($5,459)  is  a  charged-off  debt  to  a  different  credit  union.  The  debt
concerns a car Applicant purchased for his wife in 2012, so she could get to work. She
assumed responsibility for this debt, but did not make payments after they separated. (AE
J) She was also responsible for the debt in their divorce stipulation. (Answer; AE C) She
stopped making payments on the car after it was totaled. (Tr. 37-40, 43, 86-87; Answer)
Applicant is considering pursuing his former wife in court to get her to pay the account,
as agreed. (AE M) However, Applicant admits the debt and has assumed responsibility
to pay it. (Tr. 32-33, 43-45, 51, 57-59, 86-88; AE N, AE O) He has arranged a $300 a
month  payment  plan  with  the  creditor.  As  a  result,  a  garnishment  of  his  wages  by  the
creditor has been released. (AE Y) The debt is being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.d ($1,016) relates to a home alarm system Applicant and his second wife
installed  at  their  home.  (Answer)  Documentation  from  the  creditor  shows  they  are  no
longer collecting on the account. (Tr. 33, 46-48, 60-63, 88-89; AE E; AE L) It is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.e ($526) is a debt placed for collection by a bank. Applicant denied the
debt, asserting that it is being paid. (Answer) He submitted post-hearing documentation
that the account was satisfied in December 2018. (AE X; Tr. 34, 63-66, 89)
SOR  ¶  1.f ($224)  is  a  debt  placed  for  collection  by  a  cable  company.  Applicant
believes the debt belongs to a former tenant. (Answer) He believes it is no longer listed
on his credit reports. He was unable to provide documentation of its resolution. (Tr. 34,
66-68, 89-91)
Applicant  retained  a  credit  counselor  in  November  2019.  His  budget  indicated
$4,500 in income from his job, and $1,100 a month in disability pay. (AE F) He lives with
his grandmother and pays $250 in rent, and $460 in utilities. (Tr. 74-77; AE F) He has a
$619  monthly  truck  payment  and  a  $360  motorcycle  payment.  His  budget  shows  a
monthly surplus of almost $3,000. (AE F; Tr. 45-46, 51, 83-84)
A  co-worker  and  personal  friend  testified  for  Applicant.  He  testified  that  he  and
Applicant met in 2017 while taking a course together. They worked together at a computer
“help  desk”  at  a  prior  employer  for  about  six  to  eight  months,  in  2018  and  2019.  The
witness  was  Applicant’s supervisor,  and  has a clearance.  Applicant  was  conscientious
and  a  hard  worker.  He  is  also  smart.  The  witness  attested  to  Applicant’s  judgment,
trustworthiness, and reliability. (Tr. 102-110)
