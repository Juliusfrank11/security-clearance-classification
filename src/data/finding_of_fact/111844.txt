Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts totaling $31,389, and record evidence for
each debt is as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a is a debt placed for collection for $12,697. Applicant said he is currently
in the process of disputing the amount he owes to the creditor. (Item 2 at 1) Applicant’s
August 18, 2019 Equifax/Credit Karma credit report shows this account was opened on
March 31, 2018, and the status is “Consumer disputes this account information.” (Id. at
16)
SOR ¶ 1.b is a charged-off vehicle loan for $11,250. Applicant’s December 6, 2018
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) states that the
debt resulted from a vehicle loan upon which he defaulted. (Item 7 at 7) His vehicle was
repossessed on an unspecified date. (Id.) Applicant said he intended to satisfy the debt
in 2019. (Id.) Applicant said the account was opened in June 2012, and closed in June
2015.  (Item  2  at  1)  He  believed  this  account  exceeded  the  reportable  period  of  seven
years.  (Id.)  Applicant’s  August  18,  2019  Equifax/Credit  Karma  credit  report  shows  this
account was opened on June 9, 2012, and his last payment was on November 1, 2015.
(Id. at 5)
SOR  ¶  1.c  is  a  charged-off  bank  debt  for  $999.  Applicant  said  he  believed  this
account  was  opened  in  May  2012,  and  it  was  over  seven  years  old.  (Item  2  at  3)
Applicant’s August 18, 2019 Equifax/Credit Karma credit report shows the account was
opened on May 1, 2012, and his last payment was on April 1, 2013. (Id. at 11)
SOR ¶ 1.d is a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $949. Applicant
said he is currently disputing the information in his credit report. (Item 2 at 3) Applicant’s
August 18, 2019 Equifax/Credit Karma credit report shows this account was opened on
May 16, 2016, and the status is “Consumer disputes this account information.” (Id. at 16)
SOR ¶ 1.e is a charged-off department store debt for $606.
SOR ¶ 1.f is a charged-off department store debt for $452.
SOR ¶ 1.g is a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $859.
SOR ¶ 1.h is a credit union debt placed for collection for $1,333.
SOR ¶ 1.i is a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $869.
SOR ¶ 1.j is a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $675.
For SOR ¶¶ 1.e through 1.j, Applicant had the same explanation. Applicant said
his  credit  report  was  erroneous,  and  the  negative  entry  was  removed  from  his  credit
report. (Item 2 at 3) In his August 24, 2019 SOR response, for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f
through 1.j, he stated that the negative entry was “removed.” (Id. at 3) In his October 25,
2019 SOR response, for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e through 1.j, he wrote “I deny” for each
debt and explained the entry was removed from his credit report. (Id. at 21-22) Applicant’s
August  18,  2019  Equifax/Credit  Karma  credit  report  does  not  include  any  of  these  six
accounts. (Id.)
SOR  ¶  1.k  is  a  telecommunications  debt  placed  for  collection  for  $404.  In  his
December 6, 2018 OPM PSI, Applicant acknowledged he had the account in SOR ¶ 1.k.
(Item 7 at 5) He said he was erroneously charged for telecommunications equipment that
he returned, and he disputed the debt. (Id.) In his SOR response, he indicated the debt
was removed from his credit report, and his August 18, 2019 Equifax/Credit Karma credit
report does not include this debt. (Item 2)
SOR ¶ 1.l is a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $296. Applicant
said the account was fraudulent, and it was removed from his credit report. (Item 2 at 3)
The  creditor  has  an  open  fraud  investigation.  (Id.  at  3)  Applicant’s  August  18,  2019
Equifax/Credit Karma credit report does not include this account.
In his SOR response with respect to his trustworthiness, Applicant said:
I am loyal to the United States, and would never do anything to jeopardize
national security or [the] safety of our servicemen and women especially not
for financial gain. I have never had a history of drug, alcohol or gambling
issues.  [The]  only  issue  I  have  had  was  being  [the]  sole  provider  in  my
household  and  getting  behind  on  my  financial  obligations  due  to  job
transitions and amount of bills. However, I would not jeopardize my honor,
freedom  or  reputation  for  financial  incentive.  Also  I  have  cleared  up  [my]
credit report and continue to meet my financial obligations.  (Item 2 at 2)
In  the  FORM,  Department  Counsel  noted  the  absence  of  corroborating  or
supporting  documentation  of  resolution  of  the  SOR  debts.  Aside  from  Applicant’s
uncorroborated  statements,  there  is  no  documentary  evidence  that  Applicant  paid,
arranged to pay, settled, compromised, or otherwise resolved any of the SOR debts. The
record lacks corroborating or substantiating documentation and detailed explanations of
the  causes  for  his  financial  problems  and  other  mitigating  information.  The  FORM
informed Applicant that he had 30 days from the receipt of the FORM “in which to submit
a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation,
or explanation, as appropriate. If you do not file any objections or submit any additional
information . . . your case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination
based solely” on the evidence set forth in this FORM. (FORM at 4 (emphasis in original))
He did not respond to the FORM.
Personal Conduct
Section 26, “Financial Record – Delinquency Involving Routine Accounts,” of
Applicant’s June 26, 2018 SCA asked whether in the previous seven years: (1) Applicant
had any property voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed; (2) Applicant defaulted on any
loan; (3) Applicant had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency; and (4) Applicant
had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as
agreed?  Applicant  answered  “No,”  to  all  of  these  questions,  and  did  not  disclose  any
negative financial information or the repossession of his vehicle on his SCA.
Applicant’s December 6, 2018 OPM PSI states “Subject verified no to all financial
record questions.” (Item 7 at 5) In response to follow-up questions during his OPM PSI,
Applicant verified that he had accounts pertaining to the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($11,250),
1.c ($999), 1.d ($949), 1.e ($606), 1.h ($1,333); 1.j ($675), and 1.k ($404). (Id. at 3-8) He
had problems paying the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e, and he said he would pay it through a credit
counseling service. (Id. at 6) He had problems paying the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h in 2015, and
he attempted to set up a payment plan with the creditor. (Id. at 4) He denied knowledge
of the accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($12,697), 1.f ($452), 1.g ($859), 1.i ($969), and 1.l ($296).
(Id. at 3-8)
Applicant denied that he intended to provide false information on his SCA. (Item 2
at 4) He explained that at the time he completed the SCA, he had not obtained a copy of
his  credit  report.  (Id.)  He  “was  not  aware  of  errors  and  discrepancies  I  have  now  had
removed from report as well as accurate dates and accounts showing delinquent which
was a huge oversight on my part.” (Id., emphasis in original)
