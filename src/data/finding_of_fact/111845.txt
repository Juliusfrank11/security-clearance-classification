Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g. He denied SOR ¶¶ 1.b and
1.f.  His  admissions  and  explanations  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 41 years old. He graduated from high school in 1997 and joined the
Navy.  He  served  in  the  Navy  as  a  jet  engine  mechanic  from  1997  to  2010,  and  was
honorably discharged as an E-5, with severance pay. He held a clearance in the Navy.
He and wife have been married for almost 20 years.  She is a homemaker. They have
two children, now ages 18 and 17. (GE 1; Tr. 29-30, 42-43, 103-104, 116) Their son is
in college, and Applicant helps with his expenses. (Tr. 102-103)
Applicant  testified  that  after  he  left  the  Navy,  he  was  unemployed  for  about  18
months.  (Tr.  45)  Between  April  2011  and  mid-2012,  he  worked  overseas  on  several
brief contracts. (Tr. 45-48) Between these contracts, he was unemployed. (GE 1) From
about July 2012 to November 2015, Applicant worked for a large defense contractor at
a job in his home state. He was terminated after a dispute with his supervisor over the
quality of his work. (GE 1; Tr. 31-32, 50)
For much of the next three years, Applicant then worked for an aviation company
in another part of the state, several hours’ drive from his home. He would return home
on  weekends.  In  that  job,  he  made  less  money,  and  had  more  expenses  in  gas  and
food, since he was living away from home. At times during that job, he lived in his car.
(Tr. 34-38, 113-115)
Applicant  held  that  job  until  June  2018,  when  he  began  working  for  his  current
employer  and  clearance  sponsor,  another  defense  contractor.  (Tr.  29;  GE  1)  In
Applicant’s  most  recent  work  evaluation,  for  2018,  he  either  met  or  exceeded
expectations  in  all  respects.  (AE  N)  In  April  2019,  he  took  a  new  position  with  the
company, which increased his annual salary from $60,000 to $73,000. (Tr. 29-36, 125-
126; AE I)
Applicant  testified  that  his  financial  problems  initially  began  when  he  was
unemployed after leaving the Navy. They worsened after he was terminated. (Tr. 31-33,
37-38,  44)  When  he  fell  behind  on  his  debts,  Applicant  worked  with  credit  agencies
(debt-resolution companies) to address his debts but “all they did was take money.” (Tr.
58, 97)
The  SOR  debts  total  about  $22,186.  They  are  established  through  Applicant’s
credit reports from September 2018 and March 2019. (GE 2, GE 3) He also disclosed
several of his debts on his SCA and discussed them in his background interview. (GE 1,
GE 4)
SOR ¶ 1.a ($14,038) is a charged-off debt to a credit union. Applicant opened the
account in 2011 and the date of last activity was September 2014. (GE 2) Applicant said
the account was a consolidation loan that he took out to help get his bills under control.
(Tr. 52-57) The debt remains listed as charged off on more recent credit reports. (AE B
at 17; AE L at 43) Applicant has contacted the creditor but has not arranged a payment
plan. (Tr. 59-60, 70-72) The account is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b is an auto loan alleged as past due in the amount of $456. Applicant
documented that the account has been current for several months, with a $238 monthly
payment. (AE C; AE M; Tr. 61-64) The account is current and being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c ($2,506) is a charged-off debt to a bank. The debt was charged off in
June 2014. (GE 2) It remains past due, and Applicant has not attempted to repay it. (Tr.
64-67; AE K at 38; AE L at 13) The account is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.d  ($2,117)  is  a  debt  placed  for  collection  by  a  bank.  Applicant
established  that  the  account  has  been  settled  for  $1,270  and  paid.  (AE  B;  Tr.  65-69)
The account is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.e ($1,963) is a charged-off debt to the same creditor as for SOR ¶ 1.a.
The  debt,  which  Applicant  incurred  when  he  was  still  in  the  Navy,  has  a  date  of  last
activity of July 2014. (GE 2) It remains charged off and unresolved. Applicant intends to
pay it. (AE K at 19-20; AE L at 19; Tr. 65, 69-75) The account is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.f  ($643)  is  a  charged-off  credit  account  to  an  auto  shop.  Applicant
denied the debt, asserting that it had been removed from his credit report. He also did
not recognize it. (Tr. 76-77, 82-84) The credit reports in the record all show a balance of
$479 (not the $643 alleged) but the account remains past due. The date of last activity
is July 2014. (GE 2, GE 3, AE K at 29; AE L at 3) The account is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.g ($463) is a charged-off debt to a bank. The date of last activity is July
2014. (GE 2) It remains past due. (Tr. 98-99; AE K at 12) The account is not resolved.
Applicant testified that he intends to pay all of his delinquent debts. He was told
by  his  bank  to  “pay  off  anything  that’s  actionable  now,  that’s  current  now,  your  credit
cards,  your  collections”  so  he  could  get  them  to  a  manageable  debt  level  before
addressing older debts. He intends to address his debts in this manner going forward,
(Tr. 59, 70) He has contacted all the creditors for the debts he owes. (Tr. 84-85)
Applicant now earns about $3,800 per month, a salary allowing him more ability
to  pay  his  debts.  (Tr.  113,  118-119).  He  talked  to  his  bank  about  financial  counseling
and learned to set aside money in envelopes to pay for certain budgeted items. He says
this process is helping him control his expenses. (Tr. 88-94)
Applicant currently has five credit cards, but carries little to no balance on any of
them.  He  has  had  some  of  the  cards  for  many  years.  Other,  newer  cards  have  small
credit limits in order to boost his credit. (Tr. 86-88, 109-112; AE D – AE H)
Applicant  provided  several  recommendation  letters  from  references.  (AE O)  His
employer’s facility security officer (FSO), who was involved in Applicant’s hiring process,
found  him  to  be  easy  to  work  with,  patient,  respectful,  and  with  a  positive  outlook.
Another reference, a retired Army command sergeant major who recruited Applicant for
his  current  employer,  finds  Applicant  knowledgeable,  loyal,  and  dedicated  to  his
employer’s  mission,  his  family  and  community.  Both  references  endorse  Applicant’s
ability and willingness to protect national security. (AE O)
A  current  supervisor  asserts  that  Applicant  has  a  strong  and  ethical  character
and  is  “trusted  to  always  do  the  right  thing,  even  when  no  one  is  looking.”  He  is
hardworking and  trustworthy,  dependable,  honest,  responsible,  and courteous.  (AE O)
Applicant  volunteers  in  his  local  community,  and  a  leader  of  the  volunteer  program
attested that Applicant has a great attitude and a good moral character. (AE O)
A former co-worker  with  the  aviation company attested  that Applicant  had  been
his  “right-hand  man.”  Applicant  exceeded  expectations  in  the  job,  provided  excellent
technical expertise, and was a valuable employee. The reference offered strong support
for Applicant’s eligibility for a clearance. (AE O)
