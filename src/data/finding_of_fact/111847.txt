Under  Guideline  F,  the  Government  alleged  that  in  July  2000,  Applicant  filed  a
Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition that was discharged in October 2000 (SOR 1.a). It was also
alleged that Applicant owed $87,089 for 14 delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.b – 1.o).
In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  1.a,  but  he  denied  the  remaining
allegations. He also provided a six-page excerpt from a September 25, 2019 credit report,
as well as a one-page explanatory statement. (Answer)
Applicant’s denials created issues of controverted fact as to SOR 1.b  – 1.o, and
required  the  Government  to  produce  sufficient  reliable  information  to  establish  those
allegations  as  facts.  (Directive,  E3.1.14)  The  information  presented  in  GX  1,  2,  and  4
satisfied that requirement. In addition, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 59 years old and works for a defense contractor. He was hired by his
employer in February 2017 and relocated to State A from  State B,  where he lived and
worked following his retirement from the military.  Applicant served in the United States
Coast Guard from December 1984 until October 2013, when he retired as a Chief Warrant
Officer  3  (CWO3)  after  a  career  in  aviation  assignments.  Applicant  also  served  in  the
United States Air Force between September 1978 and September 1982, and in the United
States Army Reserve from October 1982 until December 1984. Applicant first received a
security clearance in 1985. His certificate of discharge lists  numerous personal awards
and was authorized to wear several unit-based awards. (Answer; GX 1; AX A; Tr. 42)
Applicant  has  been  married  twice.  The  dates  and  circumstances  of  his  first
marriage were not listed in his e-QIP and not otherwise developed in the record. In July
2000, around the time he averred his first marriage ended, Applicant filed for Chapter 7
bankruptcy liquidation of the marital debts for which he was responsible. He was the sole
debtor listed in that petition and his debts were discharged in October 2000. (Answer; GX
3; Tr. 39)
Applicant remarried in March 2001. As of the hearing, he and his second wife had
been separated since September 2015. Her subsequent return to State B was one factor
that has delayed finalization of a divorce. Since they separated, Applicant has paid about
$4,200 each month in spousal support. Applicant claims that one reason for the failure of
their marriage was his wife’s failure to manage their finances and pay bills on time as the
principal manager of their joint finances. At all times during their marriage, Applicant was
serving  in  the  military  but  was  able  to  be  co-located  with  his  wife  wherever  he  was
assigned. He believes his wife purposefully hid their unpaid debts from him and was able
to stay ahead of collectors and collection notices because they moved every two or three
years for his military postings. (Answer; GX 2; Tr. 47, 71 – 72)
Most  of  the  debts  documented  herein  are  for  student  loans  Applicant  obtained
between  2003,  when  he  began  studies  for  an  associate’s degree,  and  2013,  when  he
completed studies for a master’s degree in business administration. While Applicant was
a full-time student, his loans were in forbearance and in good standing, but still accruing
interest.  The  debts  alleged  at  SOR  1.c  –  1.g  and  1.i,  totaling  $33,484,  are  for  student
loans that became delinquent in 2014 and 2015. Applicant consolidated those accounts
in July 2018 and makes one $400 student loan payment on the 4th of each month through
automatic  debit  from  his  checking  account.  These  accounts  are  in  good  standing.
(Answer; GX 1 - 6; AX B; AX C; Tr. 39 – 40, 48 – 49, 73, 81)
Another delinquent student loan, with a balance due of $47,168, is alleged at SOR
1.b  and  represents  47  percent  of  the  total  debt  documented  by  the  Government’s
information. Unlike the other six student loans discussed above, this account is listed as
a  joint  account.  At  his  October  9,  2018,  subject  interview  (SI)  with  a  government
investigator, Applicant averred this account had been consolidated with his other student
loans.  The  investigator  asked  Applicant  to  provide  documentation  regarding  his
consolidated  accounts.  On  October  16,  2018,  Applicant  provided  documentation  that
supported his claims regarding SOR 1.c – 1.g and 1.i, but produced no information about
SOR 1.b. At his hearing, Applicant again claimed the debt had been consolidated with the
others; however, he eventually acknowledged that the debt was for a student loan he had
co-signed for his estranged wife and that he likely had not included that account in his
consolidation effort. As of May 2019, this account was still being reported on Applicant’s
credit report. Three days after his hearing, Applicant established a “temporary payment
arrangement” with the law firm that holds the account for collection to begin resolving the
$47,282  balance  due.  Starting  on  February  21,  2020,  Applicant  was  to  make  $400
monthly payments through June 21, 2020. At that time, Applicant will be able to negotiate
a further resolution of his debt. (Answer; GX 2; AX G; Tr. 52 – 62)
The  debt  alleged  at  SOR  1.h  is  for  a  past-due  utility  bill  from  State  B  that  was
referred for collection in February 2016. Applicant was unaware of the debt during his SI.
At hearing, he testified that he was still unaware of what the debt was for; however, after
the hearing, he was able to contact the creditor and make an initial nominal payment as
a precursor to a negotiated settlement. (Answer; GX 2 – 6; AX I; Tr. 62)
The debts at SOR 1.j and 1.k represent two delinquent credit card accounts from
the same lender that were charged off as business losses in January 2013 and December
2012, respectively. Applicant paid off the SOR 1.k account in 2018. The account at SOR
1.j is no longer collectable because the creditor charged it off as a business loss. Applicant
incorrectly  believed  that  charging  off  a  debt  meant  it  was  no  longer  his  responsibility.
(Answer; GX 3 – 5; AX H; AX J; Tr. 62 – 66)
The debt at SOR 1.l is for a delinquent cell phone account. A 2017 credit report
listed the debt as “in dispute.” According to a May 2019 credit report, Applicant paid the
debt through a negotiated settlement for less than the full amount past due. (GX4; GX 5;
Tr. 66 – 67)
Applicant stated during his SI and at hearing that he had paid the debts at SOR
1.m – 1.o. Applicant provided only handwritten notes about those debts during his SI. At
hearing, he relied on the absence of those debts in his credit report; however, after the
hearing he presented information showing they have been resolved. (GX 2; GX 4 – 6; AX
D; AX F; Tr. 67 – 68)
All of the debts at issue in this case involve accounts that were opened well before
Applicant  and  his  wife  separated  in  2015.  All  of  the  non-student  loan  debts  became
delinquent before the separation. As to his current finances, Applicant is in good standing
with all of his monthly obligations. His monthly income derives from his defense contractor
pay,  his  military  retired  pay,  and  a  disability  benefit  from  the  Department  of  Veterans
Affairs (VA). After withholdings for taxes and insurance, as well as for his monthly spousal
support  obligations,  Applicant  brings  home  about  $14,800.  In  2018,  he  obtained  a
mortgage to buy the house he had lived in as a renter beginning in 2017. Applicant is in
the  process of refinancing  his  mortgage  at  an  annual interest  rate  about three  percent
lower than his current mortgage. He has not missed any mortgage payments. (Answer;
GX 4 – 6; AX B – D; Tr. 40 – 41, 45, 47, 77, 80 – 81)
