I have incorporated Applicant’s admissions in her response to the allegations set
forth  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.d  in  my  findings  of  fact.  I  have  also  noted  her  explanation  in
mitigation.  Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  GE  4,  her  Application,
unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and
careful review of the pleadings, the Government’s FORM, and the documentary evidence
in the record, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant, 42, is married and has three children, ages 23, 16, and 9. She graduated
from high school and has earned some college credits. Her husband served in the U.S.
Army and was discharged between 2015 and 2017. The record is unclear with respect to
her husband’s post-discharge employment history, except that he was unemployed for a
period. Applicant and her family relocated to another state to live with her parents in about
2015. Applicant was unemployed for five or six months after the relocation, at which time
she obtained a job as a teacher in child-care program. For a period of time in 2017 and
2018, Applicant also worked at a second job. (Answer.)
Applicant  experienced  financial  distress  when  she  and  her  husband  were
unemployed  and  relocated  to  another  state.  Also,  she  reported  in  her  background
interview  that  she  experienced deaths  in  her  family;  however, she did  not  provide  any
further information about what financial impact, if any, arose from these losses. I note that
her  2018  Application  reflects  that  both  her  mother  and  her  father  were  deceased.

Vehicle  Loan  Charged-Off  in  the  Amount  of  $18,367  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  –In  March
2015, Applicant opened an account at a credit union (Credit Union) to purchase a vehicle.
The loan amount was $49,368 and the monthly payment was $690. She defaulted on the
loan in May 2018. Her June 2018 credit report reflects that she also borrowed $31,405
from a different lender in March 2015 to purchase a second vehicle and that this account
was closed following a default. In her background interview, Applicant reported that she
had a vehicle repossessed. It is not clear from the record which vehicle was repossessed.
Her June 12, 2019 credit report in the record reflects that the credit union account has a
balance of $18,367. In her Answer, Applicant claimed, “I’m currently working on resolving
all  the  incurred  debts  listed  [in  the  SOR.]”  She  has  provided  no  additional  details  or
documentary evidence to show that she has taken any steps to pay this debt or any of
the others alleged in the SOR. (GE 5 at 1; GE 6 at 2; GE 7 at 2.)
Credit-Card Debt Charged-Off by the Credit Union in the Amount of $9,182
(SOR  ¶  1.b)  –  Applicant  opened  this  credit-card  account  in  September  2016.  She
defaulted on the account in about November 2017. In her background interview and in
her SOR answer, she provided no additional information. (GE 6 at 6; GE 7 at 2.)
Credit-Card  Account  Charged-Off  in  the  Amount  of  $1,852  (SOR  ¶  1.c)  –
Applicant  defaulted  on  this  credit-card  account  in  about  February  2017.  The  record
contains no additional information. (GE 7 at 2.)
Bank-Loan  Account  in  Collection  in  the  Amount  of  $988  (SOR  ¶1.d)  –
Applicant  defaulted  on  this  account  in  about  November  2016.  The  record  contains  no
additional information. (GE 6 at 7; GE 7 at 2.)
Applicant reported in her background interview that she has received no financial
counseling. She provided no additional information about financial counseling in her SOR
answer. (GE 5 at 3.)
