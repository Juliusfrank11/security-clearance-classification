In his responses to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, all of the
SOR allegations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.g.). Applicant’s admissions and accompanying
comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence
in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  an  operations  supervisor  with  his  current  employer  since  February  2014.  He  had
previous  experience  with  other  employers  as  a  full-time  data  entry  (August  2012  until
February 2014), and as a part-time server (May 2009 until March 2013). He is a 2009
high school graduate, with a semester of college credits, but no degree. He enlisted in
the  U.S.  Army  Active  Reserve  in  December  2011,  and  served  until  he  was  honorably
discharged in December 2017. He transitioned into the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR),
and remained in that status until he was released in December 2019. He has never been
granted  a  security  clearance.  He  has  never  been  married,  but  he  has  a  child,  born  in
2013.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can  be  found  in  the  following  exhibits:  Item  3  (Combined  Experian,  TransUnion,  and
Equifax Credit Report, dated November 1, 2017); Item 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated
June 12, 2019); Item 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated January 15, 2020); Item 2 (SF 86,
dated October 24, 2017); Item 6 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated February 13, 2018);
Item 6 (Subject Contact, dated February 21, 2018); and Item 1 (Applicant’s Answers to
SOR, dated October 11, 2019, and December 2, 2019).
Applicant reported that he was unemployed from March 2013 until October 2013.
(Item 6, at 5) He identified several factors that led to his financial difficulties. He claimed
his difficulties began when he was 21 years old and continued until he was 27 years old,
and  he  indicated  that  immaturity  and  youth were  his basic  causes.  His  problems  were
exacerbated  when  his  overtime  hours  were  reduced,  leaving  him  insufficient  funds  to
maintain his accounts in a current status. (Item 6, at 7, 10) As a result, he got behind on
his bills.
In his 2017 SF 86, Applicant listed having only one delinquent account – a vehicle
repossession – caused by unspecified “financial trouble.” (Item 2, at 32-33) On February
13,  2018,  during  an  interview  with  an  investigator  from  the  U.S.  Office  of  Personnel
Management (OPM), Applicant did not identify or discuss any other delinquent accounts
until  he  was  confronted  by  the  investigator  with  information  associated  with  additional
delinquent accounts. He indicated that he did not list them in his SF 86 because he was
confused by the term “charge off.” During a subsequent interview on February 21, 2018,
he  was  able  to  discuss  more  specifics  regarding  his  delinquent  accounts.  He
acknowledged that he had not made any payments on the accounts, but indicated that
he would contact several of his creditors or collection agents in an effort to start resolving
them.  He  added  a  confusing  comment  regarding  several  of  the  ignored  accounts  by
noting that they were charged off, and thus they were “resolved.” (Item 6, at 9-10)
The SOR alleged seven delinquent accounts totaling approximately $27,800, as
set forth as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a. is motor vehicle lease for $24,000 on a vehicle that Applicant leased
for the mother of his child, but when his overtime hours were reduced and he and the
woman split up, he was unable to continue making the $288 monthly payments and the
vehicle  was  involuntarily  repossessed  in  2016,  and  $10,365  was  charged  off.  The
remaining unpaid balance is now $10,979. (Item 3, at 5; Item 4, at 1; Item 5, at 2-3; Item
6, at 6, 8) The account remains delinquent. (Item 1)
SOR  ¶  1.b.  is  a  credit-card  account  with  an  unpaid  balance  of  $9,932  that  was
charged off in 2016. (Item 3, at 5; Item 4, at 2; Item 5, at 3-4; Item 6, at 10) The account
remains delinquent. (Item 1)
SOR  ¶  1.c.  is  a  credit-card  account  with  an  unpaid  balance  of  $2,552  that  was
charged off in 2015. (Item 3, at 5; Item 4, at 2; Item 5, at 4; Item 6, at 9) The account
remains delinquent. (Item 1)
SOR  ¶  1.d.  is  a  credit-card  account  with  an  unpaid  balance  of  $1,818  that  was
charged off in 2017. (Item 3, at 5; Item 4, at 2; Item 5, at 2; Item 6, at 9) The account
remains delinquent. (Item 1)
SOR ¶ 1.e. is a charge account with an unpaid balance of $655 that was charged
off on an unreported date. (Item 4, at 2; Item 5, at 2) However, Applicant contends that
the  account  is  still  active  and  that  he  has  been  making  payments  on  it  since  October
2016. Although he failed to submit any documents to support his claims that he has been
making those payments, his January 15, 2020 credit report confirms that the account has
been current since December 2017, and that the most recent $55 payment was made in
December  2019,  leaving  a  balance  of  $747.  (Item  5,  at  3)  Applicant  claims  that  the
remaining  balance  as  of  December  2019  is  $842.  (Item  1)  The  account  has  been
resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.f.  is  an  Internet  or  cable-television  account  with  an  unpaid  balance  of
$1,341 that was placed for collection in 2017. (Item 3, at 8; Item 6, at 7, 9) During his
February 21, 2018 OPM interview, Applicant indicated he would contact the creditor or
collection agent to resolve the debt, but as of his October 2019 Answer to the SOR, he
claimed  to  be  working  on  it  to  be  settled  within  six  months.  (Item  6,  at  9;  Item  1)  The
account remains delinquent. (Item 1)
SOR ¶ 1.g. is a cellular-telephone account with an unpaid balance of $523 that
was placed for collection in 2016. (Item 3, at 8; Item 6, at 6-9) During his February 21,
2018 OPM interview, Applicant indicated he would contact the creditor or collection agent
within the following month to resolve the debt, but as of his October 2019 Answer to the
SOR, he claimed to be working on it to be settled within three months. (Item 6, at 8-9;
Item 1) The account remains delinquent. (Item 1)
It is not known what Applicant’s current financial resources may be because he did
not report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder
that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a
budget. Although he had previously indicated that he planned to seek credit counseling,
there is no documentary evidence of financial counseling.  In the absence of additional
financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better
position financially than he had been.
