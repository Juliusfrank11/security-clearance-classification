Applicant is a 67-year-old married man with three children, ages 22, 19, and 15.
He  is  a  veteran  of  the  U.S.  Navy,  serving  honorably  from  1971  to  1977.  He  is  a  high
school graduate with a certification in radar technology, and has been working in the field
of radar technology for various defense contractors since 2004. (Item 2 at 10)
Applicant failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013
through 2018, resulting in delinquent debts totaling more than $100,000. In addition, he
filed  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  relief  in  April  2018,  requesting  the  discharge  of
approximately $482,000 of debt, and he was evicted from his home in January 2019 after
a foreclosure proceeding. (Item 2 at 2; Item 5 at 21; Item 1 at 5)
In  November  2018,  the  IRS  contacted  Applicant  and  notified  him  that  he  was
claiming exemptions on his Employee’s Withholding  Certificate  (W-4 form) to which he
was not entitled. Moreover, the IRS instructed his employer not to honor Applicant’s W-4
form  or  any  new  W-4  forms  completed  by  Applicant.  (Item  3  at  199,  IRS  letter  to
Applicant’s employer, dated November 29, 2018).
Applicant contends that he has no legal responsibility to pay federal income tax
because  the  U.S.  Constitution  limits  the  federal government’s  authority to  levy income
taxes to residents of the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories or possessions. (Item
1  at  5)  Moreover,  Applicant  characterizes  the  IRS’  collection  of  income  tax  payments
from citizens who have no Constitutionally-mandated responsibility to pay federal income
taxes,  as  “the  largest  financial  crime  in  the  history  of  the  world.”  (Item  3  at  26)  By
extension, Applicant contends that any IRS garnishment of his pay is not valid. There is
no record evidence of Applicant having pursued his arguments in the U.S. Tax Court.
Applicant contends  that the  state  taxing  authority’s notice  of tax  lien  was invalid
because  it  was  filed  using  the  wrong  form  and  that  absent  “a  valid  assessment  and
verified proof of claim under perjury and signed by someone who has authority to perform
this function,” the state  taxing authority has not established  its contention that  he owes
any delinquent tax debt. (Item 1 at 6) There is no evidence that Applicant pursued this
argument in the state tax court.
