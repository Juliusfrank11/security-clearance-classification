The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  incurred  delinquent  debt  totaling  approximately
$62,000  which  include  educational  loans,  medical  bills,  and  numerous  charge-off
accounts.    He  also  failed  to  file  his  Federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  on  a  timely
basis for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017.  In his answer, he admits each of the debts
listed in the SOR, but provides no further details.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated
May 12, 2011; December 18, 2018; June 4, 2019; and November 8, 2019, confirm this
indebtedness.    (Government  Exhibits  4,  5,  6  and  7.)    Applicant  began  working  for  his
current  employer  in  November  2013.  In  his  security  clearance  application  dated
September 20, 2018, Applicant  indicates that his household  went from two  incomes to
one  at  some  point,  which  obviously  contributed  to  his  financial  problems.    There  is
nothing more said about his finances to gleen any further understanding of his situation.
Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army for four years from June 1991 to
June 1995, and received an honorable discharge.
For some unknown reason, Applicant failed to file his Federal and state income
tax returns for tax years 2015, 2016 and 2017 in a timely fashion.  He now claims that at
the time he submitted his answer to the SOR, these returns were being filed, however,
he provides no documentary evidence to support this assertion.
