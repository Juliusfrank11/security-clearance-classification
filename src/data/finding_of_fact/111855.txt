In  her  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  all
the  SOR  allegations,  with
explanations. Her admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the
pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She began working
at her present job in August 2018. She has a high school diploma and has taken some
college courses. She is single, never married, and has no children. (Tr. at 6, 25; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  failed  to  file  her  2012-2018  federal  and  state
income  tax  returns  as  required;  and  that  she  was  indebted  on  two  charged-off  credit
cards totaling approximately $7,800. She admitted failing to file her federal and state tax
returns  during  her  December  2018  background  interview  and  when  she  answered
interrogatories in September 2019. The charged-off debts were listed in a credit report
from January 2020 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.d). (GE 2, 3)
Applicant attributed her tax-filing problems, beginning in 2012, to the break-up of
a nine-year engagement; transitioning into a new job; being involved in a car accident;
being  arrested  for  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol;  and  being  advised  by  an
attorney  that  she  would  not  qualify  for  bankruptcy.  She  calculated  that  she  owed
approximately  $6,000  for  her  2012  federal  taxes.  She  decided  not  to  file  her  2012
federal or state tax returns because she did not have the funds to pay the taxes owed.
Applicant also did not timely file her 2011 federal and state tax returns. This year is not
alleged  in  the  SOR  and  this  evidence  will  not  be  considered  for  disqualification
purposes, however, I may use it to consider the applicability of mitigating conditions and
whole-person considerations. (Tr. 26, 33; AE D)
In  early  2014,  after  receiving  some  financial  counseling,  Applicant  received
assistance  from  a  bookkeeping  service,  which  prepared  her  2011-2013  federal  and
state  tax  returns.  Applicant  filed  those  returns  in  June  2014,  making  them  all  untimely
filings.  (2013  was  untimely  because  no  extension  was  requested)  Additionally,  at  the
time she filed the returns, she failed to pay the federal taxes owed for 2012 and 2013.
Her  failure  to  pay her  taxes also  will not  be  considered  for  disqualifying purposes,  but
may be considered for mitigation and whole-person considerations. (Tr. 27; AE C, D, J)
Applicant failed to timely file her 2014-2018 federal and state tax returns. In late
July or early August 2019, Applicant hired an accountant, and she filed her 2014-2018
federal  and  state  tax  returns.  She  also  made  a  series  of  payments  to  the  IRS  in  July
2019, August 2019, and November 2019 that resolved her federal tax debt for all years.
She also presented documentation showing that she filed all required state tax returns
and paid all taxes owed. Applicant was able to pay a large part of her tax debt from the
proceeds of a car accident settlement she received. All of her tax filings and payments
(for tax years 2014-2018) came after she received interrogatories in this case. (Tr. 29-
32, 36-38; GE 2; AE A, B, E-H, N)
Applicant  admitted  that  she  stopped  paying  on  the  two  delinquent  credit  cards
(SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.d) in 2013. She claims that she called the creditor for these accounts and
was told that the debts were uncollectable because of the statute of limitations. She also
pointed out that neither debt is listed in her two credit reports from February 2020. Both
debts are listed in the Government-provided credit report from January 2020. The debts
were  charged  off  and  reflect  the  date  of  the  first  major  delinquency  as  October  2013.
(Tr. 27-28, 39; GE 3; AE I, M)
Applicant’s  annual  income  is  approximately  $60,000.  She  currently  maintains
about  $6,000  in  her  checking  and  savings  accounts  combined.  She  has  a  retirement
account  with  approximately  $30,000  invested  and  a  separate  investment  account
valued at about $7,000. She has resided with her parents since 2013, but does not pay
them rent. She assists with the household expenses. She has no other major expense
items. She claims to have filed her 2019 federal tax return. (Tr. 42-44)
