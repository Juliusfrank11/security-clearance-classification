I have incorporated Applicant’s admissions in his response to the allegations set
forth in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.x in my findings of fact, and I have noted his comments on each
allegation.  For  the  reason  stated  above,  I  consider  SOR  ¶¶  1.y  and  1.z  to  be  denied.
Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  FORM  Item  4,  his  SCA;  Item  5,  the
summary  of  Applicant’s  security  clearance  subject  interview,  which  he  verified  as
accurate  (Verified  Subject  Interview);  and  Item  3,  his  January  2020  SOR  Answer.
Additional  findings  are  based  upon  other  evidence  in  the  record.  I  have  noted  such
findings with a parenthetical citation to the record.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, the Government’s FORM and
the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant, 41, has worked as an information technology engineer for a number of
companies since at least 2008. He received a bachelor’s degree in information technology
in December 2016. He has held a top secret clearance since December 2013, though in
2017 he was advised by a DOD agency that he was not eligible for access to sensitive
compartmented information. (Item 4 at 52.)
Applicant has been married and divorced twice. Both marriages lasted about two
years (2001-2003 and 2014-2016). He has three children, who were born in 1999, 2010,
and 2017. He pays monthly child support of $2,500 for his two youngest children. In his
SOR  Answer,  he  asserts  that  this  child  support  obligation  limits  his  financial  ability  to
address his other debts. (Item 3 at 1.)
Applicant provided two different versions of his employment history during the two
time periods relevant to the Guideline F allegations in the SOR. One period is the later
part  of  2015  (Period  1),  which  preceded  Applicant’s  commencement  of  a  business  in
January 2016. The business was related to Applicant’s hobby and had no relationship to
his information technology engineering work. The second period is 2016 through part of
2017 (Period 2), when Applicant incurred significant credit-card debts and loans to fund
his business. During Period 2, he defaulted on these debts when his business “stalled”
eight months after it commenced operations and ultimately failed in 2017. (SOR Answer
at 2; Item 4 at 55-57; Item 5 at 12.)
In  the  employment  section  of  his  July  2018  SCA  (Section  13A),  Applicant
represented that he has been continuously employed since at least 2008. He failed to
mention that he started and operated a business in 2016 and 2017. During Period 1, he
listed working for Company A (November 2014 through at least the date of the SCA, July
2018)  and  simultaneously  working  for  Company  B  (October  2014  through  February
2017), and Company C (September 2010 through May 2016). He wrote that he worked
for a fourth employer, Company D, from June 2014 to June 2015. His employment history
in the SCA does not reflect any loss of employment or income in the second half of 2015,
except for his work for Company D. (Item 4 at 13-14, 18-23; Item 5 at 4.)
In Section 26 of Applicant’s SCA regarding his Financial Record, he disclosed that
in Period 1, preceding the commencement of his business, he lost an “IT Contract paying
him $150,000 per year and then lost a “second job” paying him $127,000 per year. He
wrote that after the loss of these two jobs, he started his business to “generate additional
income.”  He  noted  further  that  “the  business  took  a  turn  and  downward  spiral  (sic)
extremely fast and I was unable to . . . maintain the payments” on his business debts. He
also  noted  that  his  third  child  was  born  (January  2017),  which  “further  complicat[ed]
things”  and  that  he  “was  also  dealing  with  the  financial  fallout  from  [his]  divorce  the
previous year.” He finalized his divorce in March 2016. (Item 4 at 33, 37, 55-57; Item 5 at
12.)
In  September  2015,  Applicant  moved  out  of  his  marital  home  and  rented  the
residence to a friend. He purchased a new home in the same month with a mortgage in
the  amount  of  $440,000.  In  his  Verified  Subject  Interview,  Applicant  reported  that  his
“financial problems began” when he lost his job with Company B in February 2017. He
noted  that  this  employment  was  his  full-time  employment.  He  also  explained  in  his
Verified Subject Interview that he and his business suffered a financial loss as a result of
actions of a now-former friend. (Item 4 at 33, 37, 55-57; Item 5 at 12; Item 8 at 1.)
From this record evidence, it is unclear what employment losses Applicant suffered
prior to starting his business in January 2016. His work for Company D ceased in June
2015. As of January 2016, he was working simultaneously at Company A, Company B,
and Company C. Applicant’s employment at multiple companies at the same time during
Periods  1  and  2  creates  some  confusion  in  the  record,  which  he  tried  to  clarify  in  his
Verified Subject Interview. Applicant’s failure to list his self-employment in Section 13A of
his SCA creates additional confusion. He explained in his interview that he omitted his
self-employment with his business “due to oversight.” (Item 4 at 13-14, 18-20; Item 5 at
4, 12.)
In  his  SOR  Answer,  Applicant  asserts  that  many  of  his  debts  arise  from  his
business, which ultimately failed in September 2017. He used multiple credit cards and
loans to fund his startup and operating expenses for his business. He also claims that he
provided some capital from his savings. He was unable to pay his business debts due to
the loss of his job with Company B in February 2017 and the failure of the business. As
noted,  however,  he  worked  for  Company  A  throughout  2017  and  for  other  companies
beginning  in  May  2017  to  the  present.  He  also  suffered  income  loss  from  his  rental
property when a tenant, who was a friend, failed to pay the rent. (Item 3 at 2, 3; Item 4 at
55, 63; Item 5 at 4, 9, 12, 13.)
Guideline F:
Mortgage  Debts  –  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  allege  delinquencies  on  two  mortgage
debts: the mortgage on Applicant’s residence and a mortgage on his rental property.
SOR  ¶  1.a  In  his  January  2020  SOR  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  was
delinquent on his residential mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.a, a debt of $432,371). He wrote that he
fell behind in his mortgage payments due to the failure of his business. He claimed further
that he had entered into a repayment plan with the lender and will have be current on his
mortgage  payments  and  past-due  amounts  with  payments  made  up  to  and  including
August 2020. He provided with his Answer a letter from the lender, dated August 9, 2019,
setting forth the terms of the payment plan. The plan calls for Applicant to pay his regular
mortgage  payment  of  $2,767,  plus  an  additional  amount  of  $1,820  to  repay  his
delinquencies, starting September 1, 2019 and ending on August 1, 2020. Aside from his
assertion in his Answer that he will satisfy his past-due balance on August 1, 2020, he
provided no evidence showing that he made any of the required 12 monthly payments.
The most recent credit report in the record, dated June 6, 2019, does not provide any
useful information about the current status of this debt because it predates the payment
plan. The Government provided no evidence to raise doubts about Applicant’s assertion
that he was repaying the past due amounts. The debt is, therefore, resolved. (Item 8 at
1; AE A.)
SOR ¶ 1.b Applicant admitted that he was delinquent paying a mortgage on his
rental property  in  the  amount  of  $375,172.  In  his  SCA,  Applicant  wrote  that his  tenant
failed  to  pay  the  rent.  Applicant’s  attempts  to  save  the  property  from  foreclosure  were
unsuccessful.  The  property  was  sold  at  auction  in  September  2017.  He  asserted  that
“everything was ratified and closed in March 2018.” In support of his assertion that he
owes nothing further on this debt, he provided with his Answer a copy of the court’s online
case information summary of the foreclosure proceeding. It reflects that on March 7, 2018,
the  “Final  Order  Ratifying  the  Auditor’s  Report”  was  entered.  No  deficiency  balance  is
indicated.  The  Government’s  2019  credit  report  (Item  8)  reflects  the  foreclosure,  but  it
does not indicate that Applicant has any further obligations to the lender. The evidence
establishes that Applicant lost this property due to his default on the mortgage loan and
the lender’s foreclosure of the property. The Government’s evidence does not establish
that  the  auction  of  the  property  resulted  in  a  deficiency  or  to  otherwise  contradict
Applicant’s assertions. The debt is, therefore, resolved. (Item 4 at 56-57; Item 5 at 9; AE
B.)
Credit-Card Debts - The SOR sets forth 11 allegations involving delinquent credit-
card debts that were used to fund Applicant’s business. The total amount of these debts
is over $140,000. In his SOR Answer, he provided evidence that one of these debts had
been resolved (SOR ¶ 1.e). Applicant made no claim and presented no evidence that any
of the remaining debts have been addressed, let alone paid. He wrote that he was paying
$1,125 per month on two business debts and that he was “nearing the end of repayment
and will free up monies to go towards other debts.” He also wrote that his monthly child-
support  payments  for  two  of  his  children  was  about  $2,500  and  that  these  payments
constrained  his  ability  to  repay  more  of  his  debts  at  that  time.  He  asserted  that  he  is
committed to repaying all of his debts. (SOR Answer at 2-7.) In his SOR Answer, Applicant
admitted each of these debts, except for one that he paid, which is:
SOR ¶ 1.e (collection account in the amount of $17,557) – Applicant opened this
credit-card  account  in  March  2016  and  defaulted  in  about  August  2016.  The  creditor
obtained a judgment on this debt in August 2017. Applicant submitted evidence that the
judgment was satisfied in August 2019. This debt has been resolved. (Item 8 at 2; AE G
at 3.)
The admitted, unpaid credit-card debts alleged in the SOR are the following:
SOR ¶ 1.c (past due on a debt of $48,958) – (Item 8 at 2; Item 9 at 8.)
SOR ¶ 1.g (charged-off account in the amount of $13,673) – (Item 8 at 2; Item 9
at 3; Item 5 at 10.)
SOR ¶ 1.h (charged-off account in the amount of $13,529) – (Item 8 at 2; Item 9
at 3; Item 5 at 10.)
SOR ¶ 1.i (charged-off account in the amount of $13,022) – (Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at
4; Item 5 at 10.)
SOR ¶ 1.j (collection account in the amount of $11,298) – (Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at
6.)
5.)
5.)
29.)
5.)
SOR ¶ 1.l (charged-off account in the amount of $10,637) – (Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at
SOR ¶ 1.m (charged-off account in the amount of $7,778) – (Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at
SOR ¶ 1.n (collection account in the amount of $3,173) – (Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at
SOR ¶ 1.o (charged-off account in the amount of $2,425) – (Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at
SOR ¶ 1.q (collection account in the amount of $1,268) – (Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at 6.)
Miscellaneous SOR Delinquent Debts
Applicant admitted in his SOR Answer each of the 11 miscellaneous debts. These
debts total about $66,000. Applicant made no claim and presented no evidence that any
of  these  debts  have  been  addressed,  let  alone  paid,  with  the  exception  of  two  debts
discussed below, SOR ¶¶ 1.y and 1.z.
The debts alleged at SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.k, 1.t, 1.u, 1.v, and 1.w remain outstanding.
Applicant explained in his SOR Answer that he is paying $2,500 in monthly child support
for two of his children, as well as  $1,125 per month on two business debts (Amended
SOR ¶¶ 1.y and 1.z, discussed below). These payments, he said, have constrained his
ability to pay these miscellaneous SOR debts. He asserted, however that he is committed
to repaying all of his debts. (Item 3 at 2-7) These six debts as well as five other outstanding
debts are addressed individually below.
SOR ¶ 1.d (bank loan in collection in the amount of $20,786) – In his SOR Answer,
Applicant  admitted  that  he  owed  this  debt  and  commented  that  it  was  related  to  his
business. (Item 3 at 2; Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at 28.)
SOR ¶ 1.f (unsecured home improvement loan in the amount of $14,174 on the
foreclosed rental property) – In his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted this debt. He wrote
that the lender has been acquired by one company and then by a second company. He
commented,  without  providing  corroborating  documentation,  that  he  is  seeking  to
determine which company owns the debt and “once that is settled a way forward can be
established.” The loan has been in default since about February 2017. (Item 3 at 3; Item
8 at 2; Item 9 at 8.)
SOR  ¶  1.k  (charged-off  line  of  credit  in  the  amount  of  $10,895)  –  In  his  SOR
Answer,  Appellant  admitted  this  debt  was  outstanding  and  describes  this  debt  as  a
“Checking Line of Credit used to help fund and sustain my former business until its failure
in 2017.” (Item 3 at 4; Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at 4.)
SOR ¶ 1.p (bank loan in collection in the amount of $1,538) – Applicant admitted
in his SOR Answer that he owed this collection account. He claimed that he was in the
process of making “arrangements . . . with [the collection agency] to satisfy this debt within
the next 30 days. Documentation can be provided upon collection.” His assertion was not
subsequently corroborated with any documents. (Item 3 at 5; Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at 29.)
SOR ¶ 1.r (collection account in the amount of $907 for a delinquent insurance
debt)  –  Applicant  admitted  this  debt  in  his  SOR  Answer.  He  wrote  that  he  is  “making
arrangements to satisfy this account within the next 30 days” and that “[d]ocumentation
can  be  provided  upon  completion.”  Applicant  submitted  no  documentation  evidencing
payment. (Item 3 at 6; Item 8 at 3.)
SOR ¶ 1.s (collection account in the amount of $379 for a delinquent utility bill) –
In his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted that there is a balance due on this account, which
is associated with his foreclosed rental property. He asserted that there is a dispute about
who is responsible for this debt. He also wrote, however, that the balance will be paid,
“within the next 30 days” and that “documentation can be provided upon completion.” He
provided no additional documentation evidencing the payment of this debt. (Item 3 at 6;
Item 8 at 4.)
SOR ¶ 1.t (charged-off debt in the amount of $13,103 for a delinquent account with
an equipment supplier)  – In his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted this debt, which  was
related to his business. In his Verified Subject interview, he reported that he was working
with  the  creditor  to  resolve  the  debt.  He  provided  no  documentation  at  that  time  or
subsequently to support his claim or to evidence that he had resolved the debt. (Item 3 at
6; Item 5 at 10; Item 9 at 4.)
SOR ¶¶ 1u, 1.v, and 1.w (charged-off debts in the amounts of $2,139; $1,981;
and $307, respectively, for delinquent accounts with an equipment supplier) – Applicant
admitted in his SOR Answer that these business debts remained unpaid. (Item 3 at 6-7;
Item 9 at 6-7.)
SOR ¶ 1.x (collection account in the amount of $1,013 for a delinquent account) –
Applicant  admitted  in  his  SOR  Answer  that  this  debt  was  “valid.”  He  commented  that
“there  was  concerns  over  who  owed  the  balance  as  this  account  is  related  to  [the
foreclosed rental property.]” He noted further that “arrangement are being made to satisfy
this  debt  within  the  next  60  days”  and  that  [d]ocumentation  can  be  provided  upon
completion.” He provided no further documentary evidence to show that this debt had, in
fact, been paid. (Item 3 at 7; Item 9 at 29.)
SOR Allegations Added in the Amendment
SOR ¶ 1.y ($32,971) and SOR ¶ 1.z ($17,109) are both judgments entered against
Applicant  in  favor  of  two  lenders  to  his  business.  Neither  judgment  is  listed  on  credit
reports in the record. However, Applicant listed both debts on his SCA, though the debt
at  ¶  1.y  was  listed  as  being  owed  to  a  different  creditor.  (SCA  at  55-56.)  He  also
addressed  the  status  of  both  debts  in  his  SOR  Answer,  and  provided  letters  from  the
judgment creditors regarding settlement offers. (AE C; AE F)
Department  Counsel  amended  the  SOR  on  the  basis  of  this  information.  Since
Applicant did not respond to the SOR or to the FORM, I consider SOR ¶¶ 1.y and 1.z to
be denied. However, the debts are established by Applicant’s own statements in his SCA
and by the settlement documents he provided with his Answer.
SOR ¶ 1.y  -  The  debt  alleged  at  SOR  ¶  1.y  was  listed  by Applicant  in  his SCA
under the name of a different creditor, but that creditor and debt were not listed among
the  original  SOR  allegations.  Applicant  submitted  with  his  SOR  Answer  a  letter,  dated
October 22, 2018, from the lawyer of a judgment creditor agreeing to settle the debt with
monthly payments commencing on November 1, 2018, and ending on or about December
1, 2022. This letter established this debt. Under this settlement, Applicant was obliged to
pay various amounts over that time period. At the time of his January 2020 SOR Answer,
he was obligated to pay $800 per month. He provided no documentary evidence that he
was  making these  payments. In addressing  other  debts  alleged in the  SOR,  Applicant
asserted that he was paying $1,125 towards two business debts. He did not identify the
debts, however, he provided documents identifying this business debt and the business
debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.z.  I  accept  Applicant’s  undisputed  representation  that  he  has
been paying the monthly payments on the resolution of this judgment. This debt is being
resolved. (Item 3 at 55-56; AE C at 1-2.)
SOR ¶ 1.z - Applicant attached to his SOR Answer a letter, dated February 11,
2019,  regarding  a  proposed  settlement  agreement  for  the  payment  over  time  of  a
judgment in the amount of $17,109 entered on September 28, 2016, against Applicant
and  his  business  by  a  state  court  in  a  state  other  than  where  Applicant  resided  and
conducted  his  business.  Under  the  terms  of  the  proposed  settlement,  Applicant  was
obliged to make monthly payments in various amounts over time from February 2019 until
late 2020. At the time of Applicant’s January 2020 SOR Answer, Applicant was obliged
to pay $625 per month. The total of the two payments under the settlement terms of the
two debts that Applicant was paying January 2020 would have been $1,425 ($800 plus
$625), not the $1,125 amount Applicant claimed in his SOR Answer. Applicant provided
no explanation for this discrepancy in his SOR Answer. Nevertheless, I accept Applicant’s
unchallenged  representation  that  he  has  made  his  monthly  payments  under  his
settlement agreement with this judgment creditor. This debt is being resolved. (SCA at
55; AE F at 1-2.)
Guideline G:
The SOR sets forth five allegations under Guideline G regarding Applicant’s two
alcohol-related  arrests  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a  and  2.b)  and  his  participation  in  two  alcohol
awareness, recovery, and rehabilitation programs (SOR ¶¶ 2.c and 2.d). The SOR also
alleges that he continued to drink alcohol until at least April 2019. In his  January 2020
SOR Answer, Applicant admitted each of the allegations under Guideline G and provided
some additional information. He also wrote he no longer drinks alcohol and “frequently
refrain[s] from associated (sic) in places that will have alcohol.” (Item 3 at 7-8.)
Shortly after midnight on November 2, 2014, the state police stopped Applicant’s
car after observing that Applicant and a second driver appeared to be racing at a high
rate of speed. After failing a set of field sobriety tests and registering a BAC of .13 in an
alcohol breath-analysis test, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the
Influence (DUI) and certain other charges. Before his court case was finally adjudicated,
he was arrested again for DUI on August 2, 2015. He wrote in his SOR Answer that the
second arrest occurred after he was involved in a single-vehicle accident. The charges
arising  from  the  first  arrest  were  subsequently  dropped,  and  Applicant  was  given
probation before judgment on his second arrest and DUI charge. (Item 3 at 7-8; Item 7 at
1-6, AE H; AE I.)
From  January  to  March  2015,  Applicant  participated  in  an  alcohol  and  drug
recovery program. He attended six group sessions and was given a “Good” prognosis at
the time of discharge. On or about November 18, 2015, after his second DUI arrest on
August  2,  2015,  he  completed  a  26-session  rehabilitation  program,  which  began  on
September 22, 2015. These programs are improperly alleged in the SOR as disqualifying.
(SOR ¶¶ 2.c-2d.) Applicant completed a third alcohol  program on March 23, 2019.  He
also provided evidence that he completed a three-hour alcohol awareness program on
November 6, 2014, shortly after his first arrest. He has never been diagnosed as having
any issues or dependencies on alcohol. (Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 6-9.)
Applicant  responded  to  the  Government’s  interrogatories  on  July  29,  2019,
regarding his alcohol consumption. He wrote that he drank alcohol on two occasions in
2019, once on January 11, 2019, and again on April 20, 2019. He reported that the last
time he drank alcohol to excess and became intoxicated was on December 14, 2018. He
commented that he has removed all alcohol from his home and aspires to be the best
person he can be for the sake of his youngest child. (Item 6 at 2-4.)
