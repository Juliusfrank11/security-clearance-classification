Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.e., 1.f., and 1.h~1.k. He denied
SOR  allegations  ¶¶  1.a~1.d,  and  1.g.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  46-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  pages  5
and  13.)  He  has  a  Bachelor’s  Degree,  and  two  Master’s  Degrees  from  American
universities. (TR at page 15 lines 6~19.) Applicant has been employed with the defense
contractor since April of 2017. (GX 1 at page 13, and TR at page 59 line 20 to page 61
line 18.) He is married to a U.S. citizen. (GX 1 at pages 21~22.)
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a.~1.d.  Applicant  categorically  denies  these  allegations  regarding  a  former
business  interest  in  Pakistan.  His  American  company  dealt  with  solar  panels.  (TR  at
page 18 line 3 to page 24 line 12, and AppX F.) It was deregistered in the United States
and Pakistan in in 2019, as evidenced by formal documentation submitted by Applicant
on behalf of his former business. (TR at page 18 line 3 to page 24 line 12, and AppXs A
and E.)
Applicant’s  enrolment  with  the  solar  panel  company  was  never  “hidden,”  as
alleged.  This  is  clear  from  the  registration  and  deregistration  documentation,  noted
above. He  did draft email correspondence to Pakistan’s Minister of Finance (AppX B),
but  it  was  for  his  American  nephew,  who  was  the  company’s  Chief  Operating  Officer.
(TR at page 27 line 5 to page 30 line 1, at page 46 line 22 to page 48 line 10, and AppX
C.)
While  the  former  company  did  employ  six  Pakistani  relatives,  it’s  foreign  bank
accounts  have  been  closed,  as  evidenced  by  banking  documentation.  (TR  at  page  30
line 2 to page 32 line 7, and AppXs G and H.)
1.e. Applicant’s 70 year-old mother and 74 year-old father are dual nationals with
Pakistan.  (TR  at  page  32  line  8  to  page  34  line  10,  and  GX  1  at  pages  24~28.)  His
mother is not employed and his father is retired from a U.S. state “transit authority.” (Id.)
Apart from their primary residence in the United States, “they own a house in . . . [their]
village,” which they visit “once every two years . . . [for] about three months” at a time.
(TR at page 32 line 8 to page 33 line 17.)
1.f. and 1.g. Applicant’s brother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. (TR
at  page  34  lines  11~14.)  Between  2013~2016,  Applicant  lent  his  mother-in-law  about
$35,723 to fund the brother-in-law’s “startup home building business,” and to “help build
a family home” for his mother-in-law in Pakistan. (TR at page 34 line 11 to page 37 line
15.)  These  monies  have  been  repaid,  and  Applicant’s  mother-in-law  now  lives  in  the
United States. (TR at page 62 line 7 to page 64 line 2, and AppXs M and N.)
1.h. Applicant’s father-in-law is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. (TR at page 37
line  16  to  page  38  line  23.)  “He  works  .  .  .  on  a  dairy  farm.”  As  they  speak  different
dialects, Applicant has spoken to his father-in-law in person “probably [only] five times”
during the 12 years that he has been married. (Id.)
1.i.  Applicant’s male cousin is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. (TR at page 38
line 24 to page 40 line 15.) He is “a barber.” (TR at page 64 line 16 to page 65 line 4.)
Applicant has spoken to his cousin “five to 10 times over the last 40 years. (TR at page
38 line 24 to page 40 line 15.)
1.j. Applicant’s uncle is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. (TR at page 40 line 11
to page 41 line 4.) He is also “a barber.” (TR at page 65 lines 5~8.) Applicant has met
with or spoken to his uncle perhaps only three times. (TR at page 40 line 11 to page 41
line 5.)
1.k.  Over  the  last  13  years,  since  2007,  Applicant  has  provided  his  Pakistani
family  about  $4,000,  normally  in  increments  of  $300~$500  pursuant,  to  the  Muslim
tradition “called Zakth.” (TR at page 41 line 5 to page 42 line 16.)
Notice
I take administrative notice of the following facts regarding The Islamic Republic
of  Pakistan:  Pakistan  is  a  federal  parliamentary  republic.  The  U.S.  State  Department
has  issued  a  Level  3;  Reconsider  travel  advisory  to  Pakistan  due  to  terrorism.  The
Pakistani military and intelligence services nominally reported to civilian authorities but
essentially operate without effective civilian oversight. (HE 1 at pages 1~5.)
