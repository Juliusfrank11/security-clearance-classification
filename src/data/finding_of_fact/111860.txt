Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 49 years old.
As of his 2017 security clearance application (SCA), he was unmarried, he did not have
any children, and he has resided with his parents since July 2017. (Items 2, 3)
Applicant  attended  college  in  2008  but  did  not  earn  a  degree.  He  was
unemployed from September 2011 to May 2012. As of his 2017 SCA, he worked as a
quality assurance inspector for a DOD contractor since July 2016. He has never held a
DOD security clearance. (Items 3, 4)
The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for
tax years 2012 and 2015 through 2017 and state income tax returns for tax years 2012
through 2018 (SOR ¶¶ 1.i, 1.j). It alleges that he failed to timely pay his federal income
taxes  for  tax  years  2012  and  2015  through  2018  and  he  owed  the  U.S.  Government
approximately $6,963 in unpaid federal income taxes (SOR ¶¶ 1.k, 1.l). It also alleges
that he has eight delinquent consumer debts, totaling $63,389 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.h).
In addition to his admissions in his Answer, Applicant listed his failure to file his
2015 and 2016 federal income tax returns and pay his taxes for those years on his 2017
SCA. He further discussed his financial issues during his December 2018 and January
2019 interviews with a background investigator, as well as in his August 2019 response
to interrogatories. His consumer debts are reported on his 2017 and 2019 credit bureau
reports. (Items 1-6)
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  predicament  to  caring  for  his  ailing  elderly
parents.  He  stated  that  when  he  began  providing  daily  in-home  care  for  his  father  in
2009,  he  consequently  had  little  time  to  collect  his  tax  documents  or  find  a  tax
accountant.  In  2011,  he  became  unemployed  after  exhausting  his  vacation  and
personal leave due to caring for his parents. In 2016, his finances further suffered when
he  provided  financial  assistance  to  his  parents  when  they  could  not  meet  their
obligations. He obtained an auto loan to lease a car in 2015 and permitted his domestic
partner to use the car and make the payments on the loan, and then did not make the
payments  himself  when  his  domestic  partner  could  not  afford  to  do  so  in  June  2017.
(SOR ¶ 1.a)  (Items 3, 4)
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax account transcripts from August 2019 reflect
that Applicant did not file a federal income tax return for tax year 2018, and he failed to
timely  file  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2012  through  2017.  He  filed  his
federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2012  through  2017  as  follows:  for  tax  year
2012,  he  filed  in  July 2013,  and  then  he  filed  an  amended  return  in  July  2018;  for  tax
years 2013, 2016, and 2017, he filed in August 2018; for tax year 2014, he filed in July
2015; and for tax year 2015, he filed in September 2018. The transcripts also reflect that
Applicant owed a total of $5,606 in federal taxes for tax years 2012 and 2015 to 2017,
and he did not owe federal taxes for tax years 2013 and 2014. (Item 4)
Applicant  stated  during  his  background  interviews  that  his  May  2018  request  to
the IRS for a payment plan of $250 monthly was denied in approximately October 2018.
He further stated that he resubmitted another request in November 2018, for a payment
plan of $1,000 monthly, and he was still awaiting a response as of his December 2018
background interview. He provided documentation reflecting that he submitted a request
to the IRS for an installment agreement of $250 monthly in August 2019. He also stated
in his August 2019 response to interrogatories that he had not yet filed his state income
tax  returns  for  tax  years  2012  and  2015  through  2018.  Though  he  stated  that  he  had
filed his state income tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2014, he was uncertain about
the date in which he filed them and the amount he owed. (Item 4)
Applicant  also  discussed  during  his  background  interviews  the  repossession  of
his leased car (SOR ¶ 1.a), as discussed above, and his seven delinquent credit cards
(SOR  ¶¶  1.b-1.h).  He  stated  that  he  retained  a  debt  consolidation  service  in  August
2017  in  an  effort  to  resolve  his  delinquent  consumer  debt.  He  stated  that  he  paid  the
service  $800  monthly  until  approximately  April  2018,  when  he  terminated  the  service
after discovering that the company was only paying one of his consumer accounts. He
stated that he intended to contact his employer’s financial program in January 2019 for
help with resolving his delinquent debts. (Item 4)
