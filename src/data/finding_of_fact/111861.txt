In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.g
and denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  42-year-old  program  manager  and  cost  analyst  employed  by  a
defense contractor since September 2014. He earned a bachelor’s degree in May 1999.
He  was  employed  by  defense  contractors  from  June  2000  to  December  2011,  and he
was a civilian employee of the Navy from December 2014 to August 2014. He has held a
security clearance since 2001. (Tr. 77.)
Applicant married in September 2007, separated in February 2013, and divorced
in  August  2017.  His  marriage  began  to  deteriorate  in  2012,  and  he  and  his  then  wife
began marriage counseling in 2013. They separated when Applicant’s wife moved out of
the marital home without notice, taking their two children with her. His wife left him a letter
notifying him to call her lawyer if he wanted to see their children. (Tr. 80.)
Applicant has lived with a cohabitant since March 2014. He has two children from
his previous marriage, ages 11 and 7. He and his cohabitant have two children, ages 4
and 3.
When Applicant and his wife separated, all the family debts were current. However,
the  divorce  was  contentious,  drawn-out,  and  expensive.  In  August  2015,  Applicant
contacted an attorney regarding a divorce and possible bankruptcy filing. He testified that
his financial situation had fallen apart, he was “treading water,” and he needed help. When
he  contacted  the  attorney,  his  net  monthly  income  was  $6,899,  his  expenses  were
$6,595, and his debt payments were $1,654, leaving a monthly shortfall of $1,350. (AX
3.d.2.) The lawyer advised Applicant to file a joint bankruptcy before the divorce to save
legal  fees  and  avoid  having  to  litigate  responsibility  for  marital  debt.  He  also  advised
Applicant  that,  if  he  intended  to  file  a  bankruptcy  petition,  he  should  stop  paying
unsecured  creditors  whose  debts  were  likely  to  be  discharged.  (AX  1.)  At  the  time,
Applicant  and  the  lawyer  believed  that  the  divorce  hearing  was  imminent.  Applicant
notified his security officer that he was considering bankruptcy. (Tr. 93-94.)
In October 2015, Applicant’s ex-wife filed a petition for bankruptcy. She obtained
a  bankruptcy discharge, leaving  him  solely responsible  for  what  had  been  joint  marital
debts. (Tr. 89-90.)
Applicant’s divorce was not granted until August 2017. By then, he had incurred
about  $34,000  in  legal  fees.  He  also  was  required  to  pay  his  wife’s  legal  fees,  child
support, and allocation of marital debt totaling about $39,085.
When Applicant submitted his SCA in May 2018, he and his cohabitant had pooled
their assets and had net monthly income of $11,981, expenses of $5,811, debt payments
of $5,064, and a net remainder of about $1,107. (AX 3.e.2.) At the time of the hearing, he
and  his  cohabitant  had  net  monthly  income  of  $11,524,  expenses  of  $6,177,  debt
payments of $10,212, and a net remainder of about $1,311. (AX 3.f.)
When Applicant submitted his SCA, he had total indebtedness of about $94,696.
Before the SOR was issued, he paid off several debts not alleged in the SOR, including
a $19,000 student loan. (AX 3.a at 6.) As of the date of the hearing, Applicant had paid
his lawyers in full; he had reduced his financial obligation to his ex-wife from $39,085 to
$20,688; and his total indebtedness had been reduced to $72,184. (Tr. 88-89; AX 3.h.)
The  SOR  alleges  seven  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $37,082.  The  evidence
concerning these debts is summarized below.
SOR  ¶  1.a:  unsecured  personal  loan  charged  off  for  $17,065.  This  debt
originated as a car loan obtained by Applicant and his ex-wife in February 2012. They
applied to another lender for refinancing of the loan to obtain a lower interest rate, and
their  application  was  approved  in  January  2013.  (AX  2.a.1.)  However,  after  they
separated in February 2013, Applicant’s then wife had possession of the car and refused
to sign the car title. Thus, the refinancing was never completed, and they fell behind on
the  payments.  In  May  2013,  Applicant  obtained  an  unsecured  personal  loan  from  the
original creditor, at a significantly higher interest rate, to pay off the original secured car
loan. (Tr. 107-110.) Applicant’s last payment on the unsecured loan was in August 2015,
when  he  was  considering  bankruptcy.  He  did  not  consider  continuing  the  payments
because the bankruptcy attorney advised him that this creditor was not likely to pursue
him. (Tr. 111.) The debt was charged off in March 2016.  In October 2019, the creditor
offered to settle it for $5,119. (AX 2.a.3.) In January 2020, the creditor again offered to
settle the debt, this time for $5,973. (AX 2.a.4.) The debt is not settled. Applicant testified
that he intends to pay this debt, even though his attorney has told him that collection is
barred by the statute of limitations. (Tr. 99-100.)
SOR ¶ 1.b: credit-card account charged off for $12,513. This credit card was
issued by the same creditor as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a and it was jointly held by Applicant
and his ex-wife. His ex-wife’s obligation was extinguished by her bankruptcy discharge.
Applicant’s last payment on this debt was in September 2015, and it was charged off in
November 2015. (AX 3.a at 1.) In January 2020, the creditor offered to settle the account
for $4,379, but Applicant has not accepted the offer or made any payments on this debt.
(Tr. 101.)
Based on Applicant’s conversations with the bankruptcy lawyer, he believed that
the creditor would not pursue him for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. He also
knew that the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b were not accruing interest, and so he
concentrated  on  paying  other  high-interest  debts  first.  (Tr.  117.)  At  the  hearing,  he
admitted that he had been receiving letters from this creditor about twice a year, but he
did not identify which of the three debts to this creditor were the subject of those letters.
He testified that he had not received any letters from this creditor for a couple of months,
and his indebtedness to this creditor “just wasn’t on [his] mind” when he submitted his
SCA. (Tr. 115.) He testified that he had put these debts on the “back burner” until he could
revisit them when he was financially able to resolve them. He estimated that it would be
two and half years before he will have paid off his court-ordered obligations to his ex-wife
and will be able to address the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. (Tr. 116-18.)
SOR  ¶  1.c:  credit-card  account  charged  off  and  reduced  to  judgment  for
$6,084. This debt was charged off in July 2014. (GX 2 at 2.) The collection agency filed
suit in October 2015. In November 2015, Applicant notified the collection agency that he
was unable to repay the debt. (AX 2.c.1.) The collection agency obtained a judgment in
April 2016. (GX 4.) Applicant testified that initially the creditor wanted the entire amount
paid in full and there was no negotiation about a payment plan. He also testified that the
collection attorneys made no efforts to collect the debt by garnishment or other means.
(Tr.  120.)  However,  in  September  2019,  Applicant  began  repaying  this  debt  under  a
payment plan providing for monthly $260 payments. He has paid about $1,560 on this
debt. His payments were current through January 2020. (Tr. 101; AX 2.c.)
SOR ¶ 1.d: utility bill placed for collection of $165. This debt was for utilities for
a  townhouse  jointly  owned  by  Applicant  and his  ex-wife.  They purchased  the  property
before they were married and kept it as a rental property when Applicant began working
for  a  defense  contractor in  another  state. The  tenants  did  not  timely  pay  the  rent,  and
Applicant could not afford the payments on the mortgage loan. The loan on the property
was foreclosed in May 2014 and the property was sold. There was no deficiency after the
foreclosure sale, and the defaulted mortgage on the rental property is not alleged in the
SOR. The utility bill is listed in the April 2019 credit report as disputed but does not reflect
the date or the basis for the dispute. (GX 2 at 2.) Applicant paid it in August 2019. (AX
2.d.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f: delinquent medical bills for $148 and $58. In Applicant’s
answer  to  the  SOR,  he  stated  that  the  divorce  court  ordered  his  ex-wife  to  pay  these
debts. After she received a bankruptcy discharge, Applicant paid one bill in August 2019
and the other in November 2019. (AX 2.e; AX 2.f.)
SOR  1.g:  line  of  credit  referred  for  collection  of  $1,049. The  creditor for  this
debt is the same creditor alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. It was charged off in June 2018.
(GX 3 at 11.) In December 2018, Applicant received an offer to settle this debt for less
than the full amount. He accepted the offer and paid the agreed amount in August 2019.
(AX 2.g.)
Applicant’s cohabitant has been employed by a defense contractor for about five
years  and  recently  received  a  top  secret  clearance.  (Tr.  52-53.)  She  met  Applicant
through an online dating service in November 2013, about nine months after Applicant
and his wife separated. She testified that they intend to marry but have not yet done so
because she does not want her financial assets to be vulnerable to legal actions by his
ex-wife. (Tr. 55-56.) They kept their finances separate until the divorce was final. They
have now merged their incomes with the goal of resolving all of their debts. (Tr. 68-70.)
Applicant and his cohabitant share the same financial vision and have embraced
the Dave Ramsey methodology for resolving their debts. They first tackled their current
debts and then moved on to older debts. They paid off several medical bills, the loans on
two cars, Applicant’s student loans, and Applicant’s legal bills. They next began working
on  credit-card  accounts,  paying  off  some  and  consolidating  others.  (Tr.  67-68;  AX  5.l)
Starting in 2013, Applicant has used budget spreadsheets to prioritize the resolution of
his debts.
Applicant is generally familiar with the security-clearance process. His most recent
SCA was his third. When he submitted it, he did not disclose any of the debts alleged in
SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.g. However, he disclosed the foreclosure of the loan on the jointly-owned
townhouse in May 2014, a $200 fine for contempt of court in May 2014 when he violated
the terms of a child-custody order, a court order requiring him to repay his ex-wife $35,000
from a retirement account, and a court order requiring payment of child support.
Applicant testified that he was confronted with the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a by a security
investigator at some time after he submitted his SCA. The record does not reflect when
the interview occurred and does not include a written summary of the interview. Applicant
testified that he was more concerned with the fact that he omitted it in his SCA rather than
the fact that it was delinquent. (Tr. 114.) He also testified that it was a “red flag” when the
security investigator also questioned him about the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c, because
he had not disclosed it in his SCA. (Tr. 121.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  relied  on  his  budgeting  worksheets  to  answer  the
financial questions in the SCA. The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.g were not on
his budgeting worksheets because he did not intend to pay them in the near future. His
worksheets were used to allocate income toward the high-priority debts he was trying to
resolve.  (Tr.  122-23.)  His  personal  financial  statement  dated  May  17,  2018  (two  days
before the date of his SCA) listed the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.g as
charged  off,  with  no  payments  scheduled.  (AX  3.e.2.)  He  had  been  advised  by  the
bankruptcy attorney that collection of these debts was barred by the statute of limitations.
His “debt reduction calculator,” a worksheet dated August 15, 2018, listed ten debts to be
paid in order of priority. It did not list the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.g.
(AX 3.e(3).)
The delinquent utility bill alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d was left over from the foreclosure
on  the  rental  property  in  May  2015,  and  it  was  not  included  in  Applicant’s  worksheet
prioritizing the debts to be paid. Applicant’s ex-wife had been ordered by the divorce court
to pay the two medical debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f. The medical debts were not
on Applicant’s priority list, and Applicant reasonably could have thought that he was not
required to disclose them because they were his ex-wife’s responsibility. It is not clear
why he did not disclose the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g, except that it was the same creditor
as alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, his bankruptcy lawyer assured him that this creditor
would not pursue these debts, and it was not included in the prioritized list of debts in his
budget worksheets.
Applicant’s performance evaluations for 2015 through 2018 reflect his growth as a
project  manager,  with  strong  managerial  and  leadership  skills.  (AX  4.a-AX  4.i.)  His
evaluation  for  2017  rates  his  performance  as  “exceptional”  and  comments  on  his
expertise and ability to manage and prioritize smartly. His evaluation for 2018 states that
he “consistently demonstrates exceptionally sound judgment and the ability to effectively
prioritize and balance many competing efforts.” It notes that he “takes care of his people
and is a respected team player.”
The  co-founder  and  current  majority  owner  of  the  defense  contractor  for  which
Applicant  works  is  a  retired  Navy  captain.  He  testified  that  he  is  Applicant’s  direct
supervisor and interacts with him several times a week. He considers Applicant one of
the  most  important  program  managers  in  the  company.  He  has  found  him  to  be  a
trustworthy,  reliable  and  responsible  employee.  Applicant  approached  him  about
“negative  feedback”  on  his  SCA  and  told  him  about  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.  He
considers  Applicant  a  “very  highly  reliable  and  trustworthy  servant  of  the  federal
government.” (Tr. 24-29.)
The  vice-president  and  co-owner  of  Applicant’s  employer,  also  a  retired  Navy
captain,  submitted  a  statement  supporting  Applicant’s  application  for  a  clearance  and
expressing his high regard for Applicant’s character, performance, and integrity. (AX 5.a.)
He  also  testified  at  the  hearing.  He  considers  Applicant  a  “stellar  contractor”  whose
reputation is “impeccable.” (Tr. 35-40.)
The  Navy  contracting  officer  representative  for  the  program  that  Applicant
manages testified and submitted a written statement. (AX 5.j.) For the past five years, he
has  interacted  with  Applicant  almost  every  day.  He  believes  that  Applicant’s  financial
problems  were  caused  mostly  by  his  divorce.  He  believes  that  Applicant’s  failure  to
disclose  his  delinquent  debts  in  his  SCA  was  due  to  his  erroneous  reliance  on
spreadsheets  that  did  not  list  all  his  delinquent  debts.  He  considers  Applicant  very
trustworthy  and  believes  that  his  opinion  is  shared  by  others  involved  in  Applicant’s
program. (Tr. 42-49.)
One of the four owners of the company employing Applicant has known him since
2014  and  regards  him  as  one  of  the  company’s  most  valuable  managers.  She  has
observed his skill in managing multi-million-dollar contracts. She considers him a great
leader and mentor. She is aware of the allegations in the SOR and strongly recommends
that his security clearance be continued. (AX 5.b.)
Applicant’s mother, younger sister, and several former colleagues and long-time
friends submitted letters on his behalf. They uniformly admire Applicant for his honesty,
integrity, reliability, compassion, technical skills, and devotion to his children. They find
Applicant’s explanation for not disclosing his debts  in his SCA plausible and consistent
with  the  way  he  organizes  problems  with  spreadsheets.  (AX  5.b-5.k.)  Applicant’s
cohabitant  submitted  a  statement  describing  the  contentious  nature  of  the  divorce
proceedings  and  expressing  her  admiration  for  Applicant’s  consistency,  strength,  and
integrity. (AX 5.l.)
