this  claim,”  in  reference  to  allegation  ¶  1.b.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.

20 to page 16 line 22, and GX 1 at page 7.)  He has been employed  with the defense
contractor since January of 2019, but does not currently hold a security clearance. (TR
