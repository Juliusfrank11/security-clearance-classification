Applicant admitted the sole allegation in his Answer. He is 46 years old, married,
and does not have any children. (Answer; Tr. at 18, 84-94; GE 1)
Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in 1996 and a doctorate degree in 2010. As
of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  he  worked  as  a  lead  scientist  for  his  employer,  a  DOD

Applicant used marijuana from approximately  1991 to March 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.a).
He purchased marijuana for personal use from friends and his brother between 1991 and
2012. After marijuana was legalized in his home state in 2012, he purchased ingestible
marijuana  from  state  dispensaries  between  2014  and  2018.  He  disclosed  his  use  and
purchase  of  marijuana  on  his  2018  SCA.  He  has  always  known  that  marijuana  use  is
illegal.  He  first  used  marijuana  during  his  first  year  of  college  in  1991.  He  used  it
recreationally and approximately once a week throughout college. His marijuana use was
primarily  with  college friends, but  he acknowledged  that  he used  it  alone on  occasion.
(Answer; Tr. at 26-84; GE 1)
Applicant continued to use marijuana after graduating from college while working
in the private sector. He underwent and passed pre-employment drug testing with various
employers, but he was not subsequently subject to drug testing. He was unaware  that
any  of  his  employers  prohibited  illegal  drug  use.  He  did  not  use  marijuana  at  work  or
report  to  work  under  the  influence  of  marijuana.  He  used  it  recreationally  and
approximately twice monthly from around 1996 to 2000. He then used it approximately
once every three weeks from around 2000 to 2003, and then once monthly from around
2003 to February 2018. He used marijuana to relax, primarily when he was alone at home
and during the weekends. He stated that it was “my equivalent of having a glass of wine
after a long day or a long couple of weeks.” He used marijuana with his brother, his wife’s
cousin, and friends; and he used marijuana with his spouse once, in around 2002. His
marijuana use did not adversely affect his job performance and he was favorable rated
by his employers during this period. (Answer; Tr. at 26-94; GE 1)
Applicant abstained from marijuana use four times: (1) in 2006 for three months;
(2) from 2008 to 2009; (3) from 2010 to early 2012; and (4) from 2014 to 2015. The first
two  periods  of  abstention  occurred  during  two  major  examinations  for  his  doctoral
program;  the  third  occurred  during  the  year  that  he  worked  overseas,  where  the
consequences of illegal drug use were severe, and for five months after his return to the
United States; and the fourth occurred because he had no need to use it. (Answer; Tr. at
26-94; GE 1)
Applicant  decided  to  permanently  stop  using  marijuana  in  March  2018.  The
impetus for his decision was his recruitment by his current employer. He testified:
[My employer] described the position to me and we had a very frank and
open  discussion  about  my  marijuana  use  and  my  history.  The  exact
conversation we’ve had here, I had with [my employer]. And [my employer]
made it very clear to me that marijuana use was strictly prohibited and was
not  conducive  with  the  position  that  I  was  looking  at  taking.  And  I
immediately  stopped.  I  realized  that  this  position  was  the  --  so  at  first,  I
hadn’t  really  looked  very  closely  at  positions  in  government,  advising  the
government on tactical matters. That was not a job that I had really looked
at  closely.  I  was  approached  by  [my  employer].  We  had  this  frank
discussion. I went out through my network and spoke with other people that
had similar positions, and I became very attracted to the idea of coming out
here. So I immediately stopped my marijuana use and signed an agreement
with [my employer] . . . .

Applicant  testified  that  it  was  not  difficult  for  him  to  decide  to  never  again  use
marijuana, and he would leave if he were to find himself in a situation where illegal drugs
were  being  used.  He  adopted  a  new  and  active  lifestyle  in  2018.  An  August  2019
evaluation by a licensed clinical social worker determined that Applicant did not have a
substance use disorder. He also signed a letter of intent to not use illegal drugs or misuse
legal  drugs  in  the  future  in  August  2019.  He  declared  such  an  intention  despite  his
employer’s lack of a drug testing program. His spouse was aware of and supported his
commitment to abstain from marijuana use. He disassociated from most of the individuals
with whom he previously used marijuana, except for his brother, his wife’s cousin, and his
two friends. He notified these four individuals in March 2018 about his decision to abstain
from marijuana and his intent to disassociate from anyone who used it in his presence,
and they were supportive of his decision. (Answer; Tr. at 18-94; AE I, J, K, L)
The two founding partners of the company for whom Applicant worked testified.
Both  were  aware  of  Applicant’s  illegal  drug  use  and  were  confident  in  his  decision  to
abstain  from  such  use.  They  described  Applicant  as  an  outstanding  employee  and  a
trustworthy, honest, and reliable individual. Several former co-workers who were aware
of  Applicant’s  marijuana  use  also  attested  to  Applicant’s  reliability,  honesty,  and
trustworthiness.  His  performance  for  the  period  of  September  to  December  2018  was
rated favorably by his employer. His previous employer also rated him favorably for the
years in which he worked there, from 2011 to 2018. (Answer; Tr. at 94-122; AE I, J, K, L)
