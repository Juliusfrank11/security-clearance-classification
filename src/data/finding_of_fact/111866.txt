Applicant is a 38-year-old strength coach for a defense contractor, employed since
2017. He received a bachelor’s degree in 2006, and a master’s degree in 2008. He served
on active duty in the United States Army Reserve from 1999 to 2007, and was activated
from 2001 to 2003. He deployed to Qatar for eight months in 2001 to 2002. He married in
2009, but separated in July 2015 and is planning to divorce. He has three children, ages
5, 9, and 14.
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  owes  approximately  $83,000  in  delinquent  debts,
including substantial student loans, and some medical and utility debts. He admitted all
of  the  SOR  allegations  except  for  a  small  medical  collection  account  (SOR  ¶  1.u).
Applicant  testified  that  his  student  loan  debts  fell  into  default  because  of  his  pending
divorce, but he intends to arrange payment plans. He noted that while in college, he had
a garnishment order to collect student loans, but has not had contact with loan servicing
companies  since.  He  noted  that  his  financial  priority  was  resolving  the  divorce  before
paying student loans. He has not taken action to resolve the remaining utility and medical
debts, however he believes he paid the medical debts listed on his credit report that are
in a collection status, including SOR ¶ 1.h. No documentary evidence of such payments
or account resolutions was submitted.
Applicant testified that his spouse did not work, and he did not earn enough to pay
his expenses and student loans. He hired a credit-repair company but only used them for
about  five  months  before  closing  the  account.  He  has  about  $500  net  remainder  after
paying expenses, and currently about $3,000 in bank savings, although he usually has
only $200 to $300 in savings at any given time. There is no evidence that Applicant has
had financial counseling.
