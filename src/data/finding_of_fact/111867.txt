Applicant  is  a  44-year-old  single  woman  with  one  child,  age  3.  She  earned  an
undergraduate degree in 1998, followed by a master’s degree in 2005. She works for a
defense contractor as a travel coordinator. (Tr. 18) She has worked for the same employer
for the past six years.
The SOR alleges a student loan delinquency totaling $32,110 (subparagraph 1.a).
Applicant disputes this debt, contending that her grandmother, who paid for her college
education, satisfied this loan in 2004. (GE 2 at 10) Moreover, Applicant asserts that she
had no idea this debt appeared on her credit report as unresolved until she applied for a
mortgage loan in 2008. (Tr. 14) She provided the bank’s loan officer with a letter from the
student loan creditor, dated August 24, 2004, notifying her that her student loan was fully
satisfied.  (GE  2  at  10)  Subsequently,  the  mortgage  loan  was  approved  and  Applicant
purchased the home. (GE 3 at 1)
Applicant  received  no  further  derogatory  information  about  this  allegedly
outstanding loan until she applied for a security clearance in 2018. (Tr. 32) Then, two
credit bureau reports generated as part of her background investigation noted that the debt
still existed, had been transferred to another lender, and was in collection. (GE 3 at 2; GE
4 at 2)   When Applicant sent the new creditor a copy of the 2004 letter informing her that
the debt was satisfied, the creditor stated that this was not dispositive, and it instructed her
to provide additional information, such as a cancelled check. (Tr. 36) By then, Applicant
could  not  procure  any  additional  information  from  her  grandmother  because  her
grandmother had been deceased for 12 years.
Applicant then began searching for an attorney to contest the debt. (Tr. 38) While
she was looking for an attorney, the creditor garnished her wages for $700 monthly. (Tr.
34)  On  February  12,  2020,  Applicant  entered  into  a  rehabilitation  agreement  with  the
creditor in which she agreed to satisfy the debt in $5 monthly payments. (AE B; Tr. 39)
This  rehabilitation  loan  is  a  bridge  to  a  federal  government  student  loan  for  which
Applicant applied on February 20, 2020. (AE A) Although Applicant still contends that the
loan was satisfied in 2004, she has decided to continue executing a consolidation and
payment plan in the event that her dispute is unsuccessful. (Tr. 37-38)
The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.b is a cable television bill allegedly totaling
$795. Applicant admits that she owes the creditor money, but denies that the amount is as
high as alleged in the SOR. Specifically, she admits that she was two months behind on
her bill when she stopped service in June 2018, but contends that the total was $350, not
$795. (Tr. 42; Answer at 2)  After receiving the bill with the allegedly incorrect amount due
in September 2018, Applicant began contacting the creditor to dispute it. (Tr. 41) Despite
multiple attempts to contact the creditor, she has yet to receive a response. She does not
want  to  pay  the  $350  balance  that  she  agrees  is  owed  unless  she can verify with the
creditor that that amount represents the full and final amount due. (Tr. 42)
The  debt  alleged  in  subparagraph  1.c  totals  $1,304.  Applicant  disputes  it,
contending  that  she  once  had  a  credit-card  account  with  this  company,  but  that  she
satisfied it ten years ago. She disputed it online, but provided no documentary evidence
supporting her contention. (Tr. 46)
The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.d totals $1,633. Applicant contends that she
satisfied  this  debt.  Specifically,  she  had  a  previous  account  with the same credit card
company.  When  she  closed  it  several  years  ago,  there  was  no  outstanding  balance.
Applicant contends that payments to the account alleged in subparagraph 1.d were being
erroneously credited to the old account.  The only exhibit the Government submitted in
support of the existence of this debt is a credit bureau report which indicates that the bill is
in dispute and that Applicant formally disputed it six months before she underwent her
investigative  interview. (GE 4 at 5)  It no longer appears on any of her updated credit
reports. (AE C - AE E)
Applicant  earns  $91,000  annually.  (Tr.  18)  She  contributes  5  percent each pay
period to her retirement plan and saves $100 each month in a college savings account.
(Tr. 58) Her mortgage payments and her car note payments are current.
