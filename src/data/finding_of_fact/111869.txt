Applicant  was  unemployed  from  August  2008  to  June  2009;  March  2015  to

$42,000.  The  debts  became  delinquent  between  approximately  2014  and  2018.  The

and a debt related to an apartment lease. (Item 1; Item 5; Item 6; Item 7)
During her March 2019 personal subject interviews with a government investigator,
Applicant indicated that her debts were the result of her various periods of unemployment
and her maternity leave following the May 2018 birth of her son. She is willing to repay
her financial obligations, but does not have the resources and, as a result, has not yet
resolved the delinquent debts. Applicant has not attended credit counseling. (Item 5)

explanation, additional information, or supporting documentation. She did not respond to
