Applicant is a 38-year-old design engineer employed by a defense contractor since
February  2019.  He  was  previously  employed  as  a  shipyard  contractor  employee  from
2004 to 2019. Applicant graduated from high school in 1999, and completed some college
credits. He married in 2002, separated in about 2008, and divorced in 2010. He remarried
in 2018 and has two children that do not live with him. He served on active duty in the
United States Air Force from 2000 until he was honorably discharged in 2004.
The  original  SOR  alleges  Applicant  has  four  delinquent  debts  totaling  about
$45,000.  The  debts  include  a  home  equity  line  of  credit  and  credit  card  accounts.
Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, with explanations. The amended SOR alleges
under guideline G, that Applicant was arrested in September 2019 for driving under the
influence  of  alcohol  (DUI).  The  DUI  allegation  was  cross  alleged  under  Guideline  J.
Applicant admitted the DUI arrest, but denied the cross allegation under Guideline J.
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  a  home  equity  line  of  credit  (HELOC)  debt  with  his  former
spouse. According to Applicant’s 2019 credit report, the last payment on the loan was in
October 2013. Applicant’s December 2008 separation agreement permitted him to live in
the property and pay expenses until it was sold, but his former spouse was responsible
for paying the HELOC as required. She did not do so, and the HELOC debt was eventually
charged  off.  Applicant  received  an  IRS  Form  1099-C  (Cancellation  of  Debt)  for  the
charged-off  amount.  The  account  is  resolved.  Of  note,  but  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,
Applicant and his mother lived in the home for about one year without paying the majority
of mortgage payments as required, and the home was foreclosed around 2009.
SOR ¶ 1.b is a consumer credit card debt. The debt was placed for collection in
June  2018.  Applicant  negotiated  a  settlement  and  paid  the  debt  in  June  2018.  This
account is resolved. SOR ¶ 1.c is another credit account with the most recent payment
being paid in August 2017. Applicant resolved it in Jan 2018 and it was removed from his
credit  report.  This  account  is  resolved.  SOR  ¶  1.d  is  a  home  improvement  credit  card
account  that  fell  into  default  and  was  charged  off  in  about  January  2018.  Applicant
testified that  he paid the debt in 2018, and it was removed from his credit report. This
account is resolved.
Applicant  purchased  a  house  in  February  2019,  and  has  not  missed  a  house
payment.  He  has  bank  savings  accounts  valued  at  about  $5,000,  a  401K  retirement
account  valued  at  about  $10,000,  and  a  pension  fund  with  over  $40,000.  His  current
spouse  works  at  the  same  government  facility  as  he  does.  He  has  not  had  financial
counseling.
In  September  2019,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  DUI.  He  met  his  spouse  at  a
restaurant/bar  to  discuss  plans  for  their  wedding  anniversary.  When  he  left,  he  was
stopped for not maintaining his lane, and failed the field-sobriety test. His blood alcohol
level tested at .13%, well over the legal limit. He was confined and released on bail. He
pleaded not guilty in September 2019, and is awaiting trial. Applicant had a previous DUI
in  2006  that  was  resolved  in  2007  with  a  dismissal  after  completing  probation  and  an
alcohol and substance abuse program. He has not submitted to a medical or substance
abuse  evaluation,  although  after  the  hearing  in  this  case,  he  attempted  to  contact
counselors  that  would  accept  a  new  client,  but  so  far  he  has  been  unsuccessful  in
scheduling a program. He noted that he uses a ride share service after drinking when a
designated driver is unavailable. He claims that he drinks one to two beers a week on a
social basis. No character or work performance evidence was submitted.
