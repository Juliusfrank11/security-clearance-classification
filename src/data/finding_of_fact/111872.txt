Applicant, age 34, married her second husband in November 2017. She divorced
her  first  husband  of  three  years  in  December  2016.  She  has  one  minor  child  with  her
first husband, and two stepchildren with her second husband (one minor and one adult).
She earned a bachelor’s degree in 2008 and master’s degree in 2011, from the same
university. She attended a different university from 2014 through 2016, without earning
a degree. She has been employed by the same defense contractor since 2010, during
which  time  she  has  been  promoted  five  times,  most  recently  in  April  2016.  She  was
initially employed as an administrative assistant and now works as a program director.
She is seeking to upgrade the DOD security clearance granted to her in August 2018.
On  her  October  2018  SCA,  Applicant  reported  approximately  $120,000  of
delinquent  federal  student-loan  debt.  She  explained  that  she  fell  behind  with  her
monthly loan payments following the separation from her first husband. She separated
on  an  unspecified  date  due  to  his  adultery  and  abusive  actions  against  her  and  their
infant child. She incurred substantial expenses to set up a new life for her and her child.
She  has  not  received  any  financial  support  from  her  first  husband,  and  he  has  never
paid  his  $725  monthly  child  support  obligation.  As  of  September  2019,  he  was
approximately $20,000 in arrears. The record did not specify her income and expense
history from before, during, or after the separation. (Item 2 at 3; Item 3 at 42-43)
Applicant has been in contact with her student-loan lenders at various times prior
to and since her 2016 divorce. She has made requests for forbearance, deferment, and
repayment  plans,  and  also  “made  payments  when  [she]  could.”  While  some  of  her
requests  were  granted,  others  were  not  because  the  lenders  considered  only  her
income  and  not  her  monthly  obligations.  In  June  2012  and  December  2013,  her
forbearance requests were approved by one of her lenders. That same lender approved
deferments in September 2014 and December 2014. Between February 2013 and July
2014, she scheduled four unspecified payments for unspecified student-loan accounts.
Between  May  2015  and  June  2018,  she  sent  ten  payments  totaling  $1,343  for
unspecified  student-loan  accounts.  In  about  2017,  at  least  one  of  her  income  tax
refunds (of an unspecified amount) was applied towards one of her unspecified student
loans.  In  October  2018,  she  requested  an  income-driven  repayment  plan,  which  was
approved as of August 2019. There is no evidence in the record of any payments made
since June 2018. (AE G, H; Item 2; Item 3 at 43; Item 4 at 7; Items 5, 6)
The  August  2019  SOR  alleged  four  student-loan  debts  totaling  $288,526,
including  the  federal  student-loan  debt  reported  on  Applicant’s  SCA,  which  was  in
collection  status  with  a  $126,126  balance  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  The  three  other  alleged  debts
included:  1)  a  collection  account  with  a  $54,272  balance  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  (while  not
specified  in  the  record,  this  account  appears  to  be  likely  related  to  the  eight  private-
loans she borrowed between January and August 2009 with a major commercial bank,
which initially totaled $38,197); 2) a collection account with a balance of $42,306 for a
$24,000  loan  she  borrowed  in  November  2005  (SOR  ¶  1.c);  and  3)  another  federal
student-loan  account  in  collection  status  with  a  balance  of  $65,822  (SOR  ¶  1.e).  The
SOR  also  alleged  a  $102  consumer  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.d),  which  Applicant  had  resolved
before  the  issuance  of  the  SOR.  Each  of  the  alleged  SOR  debts  were  established  by
the credit reports. (AE I; Items 1, 2; Item 5 at 1-2; Item 6 at 4, 9-11, 13, 18)
In  her  September  2019  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  that  the  four  student-
loan  accounts  alleged  in  the  SOR  had  not  yet  been  resolved,  but  denied  them  as
alleged  in  the  SOR,  apparently  based  on  a  concern  that  the  amounts  claimed  to  be
owed  may  be  incorrect.  However,  she  asserted  that  she  fully  intends  to  repay  them
once she receives “complete and accurate proof of debt.”  Three of the accounts (SOR
¶¶ 1.a, 1.c and 1.d) were combined and placed for collection with one agency, and the
fourth  account  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  was  placed  for  collection  with  another  agency.  In  August
2019,  she  sent  certified  letters  to  those  two  agencies  to  dispute  the  debts  in  order  to
require  the  agencies  to  affirm  the  legitimacy  of  the  debts  and  the  accuracy  of  the
amounts  that  are  claimed  to  be  owed.  Although  the  letters  had  been  received  by  the
agencies,  she  had  not  received  any  response  from  them  as  of  the  date  of  her  SOR
answer. However, she received information from  her credit monitoring service that two
credit  bureaus  removed  the  collection  account  for  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  from
Applicant’s credit report. One of the agencies noted that the removal was due to: 1) an
incorrect  balance  or  past  due  amount,  and  2)  the  contract  related  to  the  collection
account having been cancelled. (AE K; Item 2)
Applicant is a valued employee who has earned high praise and recognition for
her contributions. Her duties as program manager require that she maintain a security
clearance. She has not had any financial counseling. (AE A-F; Item 2; Item 4 at 4)
