In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. At the hearing,
he amended his answer to deny SOR ¶ 1.n, on the ground that the delinquent debt alleged
in  SOR  ¶  1.n  was  paid.  Department  Counsel  did  not  object  to  the  amendment  and
conceded that the debt was paid. (Tr. 13-14.) Applicant’s admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 50-year-old program manager employed by federal contractors since
October 2011. He was cleared for a public trust position by another federal agency, but
he has never held a security clearance. (GX 1 at 28; AAX I at 2.)
Applicant  married  in  July  1994  and  divorced  in  October  2000.  He  married  his
current wife in August 2001. He has three children from his first marriage, ages 25, 23,
and 21, and a 16-year-old daughter from his current marriage.
Applicant’s wife worked in the private sector, was laid off for about six months, and
then was hired as a software programmer for a federal agency in December 2002. (Tr.
58, 66.) She was self-taught until she began taking college courses in 2006. She incurred
two student loans, which are her sole responsibility. The payments were about $442 and
$227 per month until they were consolidated a “few years ago.” (Tr. 59.) Her student-loan
debt is about $178,000. (AAX E.)
When  Applicant’s  wife  was  hired  in   December  2002,  Applicant   had   been
unemployed for  about a  year. (Tr. 66.)  They had  made a $20,000 earnest-money  payment
on a home, which they lost when they could not afford to complete the purchase. (Tr. 67.)
In August 2010, Applicant’s wife accepted a federal position in another state that required
a  security  clearance,  which  she  received.  Her  new  job  increased  her  annual  pay  from
$57,000 to $120,000. (Tr. 72-73.) In 2018, she was hired by a defense contractor for her
current job as the director of cybersecurity. (AAX E.)
Applicant’s  16-year-old daughter has asthma and severe allergies. She requires
daily medication. Her asthma places her at a higher risk of allergic reactions. Her asthma
can be triggered by cigarettes, dust, mold, plants, pets, wood smoke, peanuts, and tree
nuts.  She  requires  an  immediate  injection  of  epinephrine  upon  display  of  allergic
symptoms. Her allergies are is so severe that exposure to them in an enclosed space can
cause her to go into anaphylactic shock. (AX BB.)
Applicant’s  daughter  is  now  enrolled  in  a  private  school,  and  she  has  an
individualized education plan that can accommodate her special needs. (AX I; Tr. 83-84.)
Applicant and his wife incur continuing tuition expenses, expenses for special equipment,
and the expenses of modifications to their home to accommodate her medical needs. (Tr.
85-86; AX BB; AX DD.)
Applicant’s wife has an inherited genetic mutation that causes multiple pulmonary
embolisms and venous thrombosis. She had two miscarriages before their 16-year-old
daughter was born in 2004, and she was on bed rest for 14 weeks after childbirth. (Tr.
64.) While Applicant’s wife was pregnant, Applicant had medical conditions that required
surgery  on  three  occasions,  including  emergency  surgery  for  kidney  failure  caused  by
kidney stones. (Tr. 64.)
In  September  2004,  Applicant  and  his  wife  filed  a  joint  petition  for  Chapter  13
bankruptcy. It was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2005, and a discharge
was  granted  in  July  2005.  (GX  6.)  Seventeen  debts  totaling  about  $49,271  were
discharged. The debts were for lawn service ($80); two unsecured loans ($295 and $740);
school tuition for their daughter ($587); three medical debts ($572, $2,680, and $864);
five  credit  cards  ($539,  $618,  $553,  $553,  and  $2,317);  two  car  loans  ($17,278  and
$20,294);  two  debts  to  a  moving  company  ($580  each);  and  state  taxes  ($136).  This
bankruptcy is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a.
Based on a pediatrician’s advice, Applicant was voluntarily unemployed from July
2005 to October 2011 to stay home and care for their daughter and homeschool her. (Tr.
62.)  He worked  in intermittent construction jobs on weekends  or when his  wife  was  at
home. (Tr. 70.) He attended college classes on line and on weekends from 2002 to 2008,
and he incurred student loans to pay for his classes. (Tr. 72.)
In  September  2010,  Applicant’s  parents-in-law  moved  in  with  them  because  his
father-in-law had serious health problems and they were unable to make their mortgage
payments. His in-laws lived with them for two years, during which time Applicant and his
wife paid all their living expenses. (Tr. 73-74).
In  October  2011,  Applicant  was  hired  as  a  program  manager  for  a  federal
contractor. He left this job in August 2012 for what he considered a better position with
his  current  employer,  also  a  federal  contractor.  His  current  financial  problems  were
triggered in December 2012, when his former employer sued him for violation of the non-
compete provisions in his contract, seeking $2.5 million in damages and injunctive relief.
(AX C.) The lawsuit was vigorously contested by Applicant and his new employer, who
voluntarily paid more than $80,000 of Applicant’s legal expenses. (AX D-G; Tr. 105.)
In January 2013, Applicant was informed by his new employer that the payment of
legal  expenses  was  a  bonus,  for  which  no  federal  or  state  taxes  were  withheld.  As  a
result, Applicant’s taxable income was increased from around $190,000 to $285,000. (Tr.
114; AX H; AX M.)
In February 2013, Applicant filed a demurrer to his former employer’s complaint,
asserting that the complaint was based on an unenforceable non-compete agreement.
(AX E.) In May 2013, the court granted the demurrer in part. (AX G.) In October 2013,
Applicant  filed  a  motion  for  summary  judgment.  (AX  F.)  Shortly  thereafter,  his  former
employer accepted an offer to settle the lawsuit for $40,000.
Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in March 2015. (GX 5.) This
bankruptcy is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. This petition and all subsequent bankruptcy petitions
were filed by Applicant as the sole debtor. This petition listed one secured debt for a car
loan with an unpaid balance of  $25,328; an unsecured priority debt for $58,000 to the
IRS; and $220,876 in unsecured nonpriority debts, all of which were student loans, except
for two credit-card accounts with balances of $1,773 and $3,400. The May 2019 credit
report  (GX 7)  reflects  that  all of Applicant’s  student  loans became  delinquent  between
December  2013  and  February  2014.  The  petition  was  dismissed  in  March  2016  after
confirmation  of  his  plan  was  denied,  because  his  unsecured  debts  exceeded  the
maximum allowed in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. (Tr. 23.)
Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2016. (GX 4.) This
bankruptcy is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. In this petition, he listed a tax debt of $3,575 to the
state  where  he  resided  from  August  2010  to  September  2014;  a  federal  income  tax
penalty of $5,845; a federal income tax debt of $89,937 for tax years 2012 through 2014;
student loans totaling $372,789; and other nonpriority unsecured debts totaling $110,502.
Six of the nonpriority unsecured debts were listed as disputed, including two large debts
for $16,228 and $45,290, but the bases for the disputes are not reflected in the record. In
January  2017,  he  requested  that  the  case  be  dismissed  because  the  maximum  dollar
amount of unsecured debts permitted in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy had been increased,
and he had paid down some of his unsecured debts. (Tr. 24.)
In  2017,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  a  blood  deficiency  and  suffered  two
pulmonary  embolisms.  He  also  underwent  multiple  gallbladder  surgeries.  (AAX  E.)  He
continued to work full time in spite of his medical problems. In November 2017, his wife
was granted workplace accommodations that include telework, an air filtration machine
in her office, no air travel, and “maxiflex” work schedules. (AX AA and DD.)
Applicant  did  not  file  his  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2013  through
2016. (AX J.) In July 2018, he made a payment agreement with the IRS for tax year 2013,
and he began making monthly payments of $1,310 per month. His total payments for tax
year 2013 were $11,790. He made no payments for tax years 2014, 2015, or 2016. His
federal tax debt as of July 2019 was $130,324. (AAX D.) He testified that in 2019, the IRS
terminated his payment plan because his tax debt was more than the $100,000 limit on
payment plans. (Tr. 110-11, 126.) He has not made any further payments on his federal
tax debt since his payment plan was terminated. His federal tax debt is alleged in SOR ¶
1.d.
Applicant did not timely file his state income tax returns for 2014 and 2015. A state
tax debt of $8,802 to his former state of residence is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d. In his answer
to the SOR, he stated that his tax debt to his previous state of residence was included in
his most recent bankruptcy petition. However, the only state tax debt in his January 2020
petition is a debt to his current state of residence, which is not alleged in the SOR. His
answer to the SOR included a statement from his wife stating that he was paying $550
per  month  on  his  delinquent  state  taxes.  She  did  not  state  whether  he  was  making
payments  to  his  current  state  of  residence  or  his  former  state  of  residence.  (AAX  E.)
Applicant has not provided any documentation of payments to either state.
Applicant timely filed his federal returns for 2018 and 2019. He and his bankruptcy
attorney testified that he is in the process of amending the returns for these two years in
an  effort  to  lower  the  amount  of  taxes  due.  (Tr.  114.)  He  and  his  wife  had  been  filing
separate returns, which increased their total income tax obligation, in order to protect her
income from the lawsuit by his former employer. (Tr. 50-51.) As of the date the record
closed,  Applicant  had  submitted  no  evidence  that  he  had  filed  his  amended  federal
income tax returns.
Applicant  filed  a  petition  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  in  January  2020.  This
bankruptcy was not alleged in the SOR. He listed a tax debt of $25,000 to the state where
he currently resides, a federal tax debt of $108,000, student loans totaling $262,594, and
nonpriority unsecured debts of $7,875. He did not list the tax debt of $8,802 to the state
where he resided from August 2010 to September 2014, which he admitted in his answer
to  the  SOR.  He  did  not  list  any  medical  debts,  but  in  his  post-hearing  submission  he
provided  documentation  of  family  medical  expenses  totaling  about  $54,352,  incurred
between May 2018 and September 2020. (AX CC; AX DD.) This bankruptcy petition was
dismissed in July 2020 at Applicant’s request, when he discovered that his payments on
the mortgage loan for their home, which was not included in the bankruptcy, would have
made his monthly payments to the bankruptcy trustee more than he felt he could afford.
His  listing  of  monthly  expenses  in  his  petition  reflected  monthly  payments  on  the  first
mortgage  on  their  home  of  $3,100  and  monthly  payments  of  $800  on  an  additional
mortgage. (GX 3; Tr. 26.)
Applicant refiled his petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in August 2020, and it was
pending at the time of the hearing. (GX 2.) This petition was not alleged in the original
SOR. Department Counsel’s motion to amend the SOR to include this bankruptcy was
granted  without  objection,  and  it  is  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.x.  (Tr.  139.)  (The  additional
allegation was mistakenly referred to as SOR ¶ 1.y at the hearing.) As of the date of the
hearing,  Applicant  had  not  filed  Schedules  E  and  F  (unsecured  claims),  because  he
hoped that filing amended federal income tax returns jointly instead of separately would
reduce the amount of delinquent federal taxes included in the bankruptcy. (Tr. 42-43.) As
of the date the record closed, Applicant had submitted no evidence that he had completed
his bankruptcy petition by filing Schedules E and F.
In the  August 2020  bankruptcy petition, Applicant  and  his wife reported monthly
income of $20,822.39  and a net remainder after paying monthly expenses of $3,554.39,
which  will  be his monthly payment if the  plan is approved. (Tr. 27.)  Applicant’s bankruptcy
attorney testified that the monthly payment to  the trustee would require Applicant and  his
family  to  “live   tight”  during  the   period   of  the  bankruptcy  plan,  because   they  would  be
required  to  dedicate  almost   all  of  their  disposable  income  to  the  bankruptcy  plan.
Applicant’s monthly payments on the home mortgage loan  (reported in his January 2020
petition as   $3,100 on  the  first  mortgage and $800 on  an additional   mortgage)  and   car
payments  (reported in  the January 2020 petition as  $829 and  $771  for  two cars)  are not
included in the  proposed  plan, because  Applicant intends to keep the family home and
their  cars. (Tr. 31.)
Applicant has completed the financial counseling required by the bankruptcy court.
(Tr. 35-36.) He maintains a spreadsheet of family income and expenses, and he updates
it weekly. (Tr. 118-19.) His current annual salary is about $190,000. (Tr. 128.) He and his
wife have a combined annual income of more than $400,000. (Tr. 131.) He testified that
he has increased the tax withholding from his pay and included the increased withholding
in calculating his ability to comply with a Chapter 13 payment plan. (Tr. 132.)
In addition to Applicant’s bankruptcy filings alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c and 1.x and
the  federal  and  state  tax  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.e,  the  SOR  alleges  18
delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $408,827.  The  evidence  concerning  these  debts  is
summarized below.
SOR ¶¶ 1.f-1.i, 1.k, 1.l,  and  1.o-1.w: delinquent student loans  totaling about
$373,763. Applicant’s delinquent  student loans are  reflected in  a M  ay 2019 credit report.
(GX  7.)   All  the  student  loans  were  included  in   the  January  2020   bankruptcy   petition.
Although most  student  loans are not discharged in  bankruptcy, Applicant  is counting on
the  likelihood  that  some  of  the   student  loans  are  private  loans  that  may   not  be   not
enforceable  because   the  statutes  of  limitation  have   run.  (Tr.  29-30.)   He   submitted  no
evidence of any payments or other resolution of the delinquent student loans.
SOR ¶ 1.j: judgment for $7,020. In Applicant’s answer  to the SOR, he admitted
this  judgment but  stated that he was unable  to  identify the original creditor.  However, in
his Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition, he identified the original creditor.  (GX 4 at 9, 18.) He
also stated that the debt was disputed, but he did not state the basis for the dispute. The
judgment  is  not  reflected  in   the  credit  report   from  May  2019   or  the  two  credit  reports
submitted by Applicant. (GX 7) By listing this debt in his most recent bankruptcy petition,
he hopes that the validity of the debt will be determined. It is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.m: payments on settlement agreement past due for $3,360. After the
lawsuit filed by Applicant’s former employer for violation of a non-compete law was settled
for $40,000, Applicant made an immediate payment of $30,000 and agreed to pay $250
per  month  toward  the  balance  of  $10,000.  For  about  a  year  and  a  half,  he  made  his
payments in cash by making counter deposits to the former employer’s bank account. He
discontinued his payments when the bank would no longer accept the counter deposits.
He testified that, in spite of several inquiries, the former employer has not provided any
new instructions for making the payments. (Tr. 106-08.) This debt is not reflected in the
May 2019 credit report (GX 7), but Applicant admitted it in his answer to the SOR. It was
included in the March 2016 bankruptcy petition, but it was not included in January 2020
bankruptcy petition.
SOR  ¶  1.n:  past  due  car  payments  totaling  $24,684.  This  debt  arose  when
Applicant stopped making payments to a third-party loan servicer and surrendered the
vehicle, which was sold. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that the loan servicer
told him in 2016 that the account was settled. The May 2019 credit report lists the account
as  a  “closed  or  paid  account”  with  a  zero  balance.  (GX  7  at  5.)  A  credit  report  from
September 2020 reflects that the account is current with a zero balance. (AX A at 39.)
Another credit report from September 2020 reflects that the debt was “paid satisfactorily
and is closed. (AX B.) Department Counsel conceded that the debt was resolved in 2013.
(Tr. 13-14.)
Applicant has received top ratings from his current employer for the past five years.
(AX K.) The Chief Operating Officer for his current employer considers him highly skilled,
reliable, credible, and devoted to his family. (AX L at 1-2.) A retired member of the Senior
Executive  Service  has  known  Applicant  for  more  than  seven  years  and  considers  him
trustworthy, loyal, and reliable. (AX L at 4-5.) A personal friend, who is a retired Air Force
officer, has known Applicant since 2014 and believes he is patriotic, devoted to his job,
and dedicated to his family. (AX L at 6-7.)
One  of  Applicant’s  immediate  subordinates,  who  holds  a  bachelor’s  degree  in
economics  and  a  law  degree,  submitted  a  letter  supporting  Applicant.  She  considers
Applicant one of their employer’s most effective leaders and committed supporters. She
describes  him  as  a  warm,  welcoming,  charismatic,  helpful,  and  effective  leader.  She
considers  him  faithful,  trustworthy,  and  a  person  of  integrity.  She  has  witnessed  his
devotion to his family. She has observed that his consistency and unwavering support of
his team has garnered staff loyalty, respect, and dedication. As a subordinate, she feels
valued and appreciated by Applicant. (AAX I.)
A coworker, who served in the U.S. Air Force for 23 years, has known Applicant
for  three  years,  and  has  had  a  personal  friendship  with  him  for  one  year.  He  strongly
supports  Applicant’s  application  for  a  security  clearance.  He  has  been  impressed  by
Applicant’s  commitment  to  the  mission  and  watched  him  inspire  his  team  members  to
provide  the highest level of service to their employer.  He  considers  Applicant  an excellent
steward of  his employer’s and  the  public’s money. He  trusts Applicant  without reservation.
(AAX J.)
