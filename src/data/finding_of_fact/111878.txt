Applicant  is  33  years  old.  She  worked  for  a  defense  contractor from  December
2017 until the end of May 2020. Her former employer plans to rehire her if she obtains a
security clearance. She is the single mother of a 16-year-old daughter. She dropped out
of high school to care for her daughter and her gravely ill mother. She earned her high
school diploma in June 2017, and she is taking college classes. ((Tr.) at 15-18, 25-26;

Applicant was arrested in July 2008 and charged with simple assault, attempted
threats  to  do  bodily  harm,  and  attempted  possession  of  a  prohibited  weapon.  In
September 2008, the charges were dismissed for want of prosecution, which is defined
as  an  “involuntary  dismissal  accomplished  on  the  Court’s  own  motion  for  lack  of
prosecution  or  on  motion  from  the  defendant  for  lack  of  prosecution  or  failure  to
introduce  evidence  of  facts  on  which  relief  may  be  granted.”  (Tr.  at  27;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2; AE I)
Applicant  stated  that she had an  altercation at  a night  club  with  her friend, who
was  her  neighbor  and  was  also  sleeping  with  the  father  of  Applicant’s  daughter.  The
friend  and  others  went  to  Applicant’s  home  where  the  altercation  escalated.  Applicant
stated that she picked up a knife in  self-defense, but did not use it.  She has not been
arrested  or  charged  with  any  offense  since  those  charges  were  dismissed.  (Tr.  at  27,
41-42, 68-70; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant usually worked 80 hours per pay period in 2010. Her employer cut her
hours  to  three  days  per  week.  This  caused  her  to  have  difficulty  paying  her  rent.  The
rental assistance office told her that she needed a letter from her supervisor explaining
why  her  hours  were  cut.  Her  supervisor  provided  a  letter  but  it  did  not  state  why  the
hours  were  cut.  Rather  than  go  back  to  her  supervisor,  Applicant  changed  the  letter
herself. Applicant told her supervisor, who stopped scheduling her for work, which was
the functional equivalent of a termination. (Tr.at 40; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant lied on a job application in 2011 when she falsely reported that she had
a  high  school  diploma.  She  received  the  job,  but  was  terminated  in  November  2013
when her employer discovered the lie. (Tr. at 17; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1)
Applicant  has  a  history  of
to
unemployment and the costs of raising her daughter without the benefit of child support.
There has not been any significant unemployment since 2014. The SOR alleges unpaid
federal ($1,025) and state ($1,300) income taxes and 11 delinquent debts totaling about
$17,400.  Applicant  admitted  that  she  owed  all  the  taxes  and  debts  at  one  time.

financial  problems,  which  she  attributed
Applicant  contracted a credit repair law firm in  2013, 2014,  May 2019, and July
2020.  It  is  unclear  if  the  law  firm  provided  anything  of  value  to  Applicant.  She  also
engaged the services of a debt-relief company in March 2019. She enrolled seven debts
totaling approximately $12,686 in the company’s debt-relief program. She agreed to pay
$200 per month into the program, and the company would use the accumulated funds,
minus their fees,  to settle  her debts. She  withdrew from  the program  after she did not
see any results. (Tr. at 19-20, 49-50; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE A, W-Z)
Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in October 2019. Under Schedule D,
Creditors  Holding  Secured  Claims,  the  petition  listed  a  vehicle  loan.  Under  Schedule
E/F, Creditors Who Have Unsecured Claims, the petition did not list any priority claims.
The  petition  listed  25  nonpriority  claims  totaling  $24,693.  Applicant’s  debts  were
discharged in March 2020. She completed credit counseling and financial management
courses as a requirement of her bankruptcy. (Tr. at 20-24; GE 3; AE A, C, Q, R)
Applicant  did not pay  all of  her federal and state  income  taxes  when  they were
due for tax years 2017 and 2018. In September 2019, she requested a $100 per month
installment agreement from  the  IRS to pay $1,754 in back taxes. IRS  records indicate
that she made $50 payments in August and September 2018, which were applied to her
2017  taxes,  and  a  $107  payment  in  November  2019,  which  was  applied  to  her  2019
taxes. She submitted proof from the IRS that she is current on all her taxes through tax
year 2019. (Tr. at 24-25, 37; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE B, S, T)
Applicant entered into a payment plan with her state in July 2020 to pay $56 per
month for 36 months for $1,794 in back taxes. She made a $50 payment on August 10,
2020. (Tr. at 28-30; AE N, P)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
December 2017. She reported adverse information such as delinquent debts, that she
was denied a security clearance in 2012, and that she was fired in 2013 for lying about
having  a  high  school  diploma.  She  reported  that  she  had  been  attending  an  online
university since September 2017. She was accepted to that university in July 2017, but
she had never attended classes. She enrolled in a community college in the fall of 2017.
She credibly denied intentionally providing false information about  her education. I find
that  any  misstatement  on  the  SF  86  about  Applicant’s  education  was  not  due  to  an
attempt on her part to mislead the DOD. (Tr. at 26, 39, 64-65; GE 1; AE E, F)
Applicant  submitted  documents  and
to  her  community
involvement,  moral  character,  and  positive  job  performance.  She  is  praised  for  her
positivity,  dedication,  dependability,  compassion,
trustworthiness,  selflessness,
kindness, responsibility, honesty, work ethic, and integrity. (AE K-M)
