Applicant  is  60  years  old.  (GX  2  at  page  5.)  He  avers,  “I  couldn’t  choose  the
country where I was born, my ancestors were exiled to Siberia from Poland and Estonia
where  they  were  fighting  against  the  Russian  Empire  for  freedom  of  their  countries.”
(AppX A at page 1.) Applicant  was previously married to a Russian women in Russia;
but is now married a second time to a native born American, and has two native born
American  children.  (AppX  A  at  page  1.)  In  1976,  he  attended  a  university  in  the  then
Soviet Union. (Id.) However, in 1991, nearly 30 years ago, he fled the Soviet Union, and
“applied  for  Political  Asylum.”  (AppX  A  at  page  2.)  Applicant  has  worked  for  his
employer since February 2016.  (Item 2 at page 12.)
Guideline B – Foreign Influence
1.a.  Applicant  admits  that  his  father,  sister  and  two  children  from  a  previous
marriage  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Russia.  (GX  2  at  pages  27~30,  and  32.)  (His
mother died in 2018.) (GX 3 at page 3.) He last saw his father in 2004, about 16 years
ago.  (AppX  A  at  page  1.)  He  has  little  contact  with  his  sister,  who  works  at  a  beauty

than 30 years,” since his divorce in 1984. (GX 2 at pages 36~37, and AppX A at page
1.)
1.b.  Applicant  admits  that  he  has  two  friends  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Russia.  However,  he  has little  contact  with  them,  one  in  2014,  and  the  other  a former
coworker, in 2016. (GX 2 at pages 39~40.)
1.c.  Applicant  admits  that  he  has  two  “associate(s)”  who  are  citizens  and
residents  of  Russia,  and  who  are  also  employed  by  the  Russian  government.  One
works for the government “as a Deputy Govenor (sic) for National Resources.” (GX 3 at
page 14.) He contacts this Deputy Governor “via Skype approximately 1 time every 1 to
2 years,” the last time being in 2017. (Id.) The other “holds a high position with the IRS
working for the Russian government.” (GX 3 at page 14.) He also contacts this Russian
IRS official “via Skype approximately 1 time every 1 to 2 years,” the last time being in
2015.  (Id.)  These  last  two  associates  clearly  pose  the  potential  for  improper  foreign
influence on Applicant.
Administrative Notice
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  following  facts  about  Russia:  Russia  uses
cyber operations as an instrument of intelligence collection to inform its decision-making
and  benefit  its  economic  interests.  Russian  intelligence  services  have  conducted
sophisticated and large-scale hacking operations to collect sensitive U.S. business and
technology information. Based on the eight pages summary offered by the Government,
Russia appears to be a significant threat to our national security.
