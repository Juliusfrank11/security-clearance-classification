The SOR alleges a $16,400 medical account in collections and six miscellaneous
delinquent debts totaling $4,570. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted owing
five  of  the  debts,  and  he  asserted  the  remaining  two  were  paid.  He  attributed  his
financial problems to being a student, unemployment for about six months after college,
and an auto accident in 2012. (Tr. at 21-23; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  was  injured  in  2012  while  a  passenger  in  a  car  accident.  He  did  not
have medical insurance at the time. The $16,400 medical account in collection (SOR ¶
1.e) resulted from the medical bills associated with the accident. He thought the driver
had  auto  insurance,  but  Applicant’s medical  expenses  were  not paid,  so he  may  have
been mistaken about the driver having insurance. Applicant called the medical provider
and the collection company, and both told him that they did not have the debt. The debt
is listed by all three credit reporting agencies on the June 2017 combined credit report.
The  activity  date  is  March  2012.  It  is  not  listed  on  any  subsequent  credit  report,  most
likely because it is beyond the seven-year reporting period. (Tr. at 22-25, 34; Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 5, 6; AE G)
Applicant  denied  owing  the  $637  debt  to  a  collection  company  on  behalf  of  a
financial  institution  (SOR  ¶  1.f),  asserting  that the  debt  was  paid  in  2017.  He provided
proof in 2018, as part of his background investigation, that the debt and a non-alleged
$722  debt  to  the  same  collection  company  on  behalf  of  a  different  financial  institution
were  paid.  All  three  credit  reporting  agencies  listed  the  debts  on  the  June  2017
combined  credit  report.  Neither  debt  is listed  with  a  balance  on  any  subsequent  credit
report. (Tr. at 35; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 5, 6; AE G)
Applicant  provided  documentation  in  his  response  to  interrogatories,  his  SOR
response, and at his hearing that the $634 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c was paid in May
2019. He testified that he paid the $214 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g. The debt was listed
by Equifax and Experian on the June 2017 combined credit report, with an activity date
of September 2015. The debt is not listed on the February 2019 Equifax credit report or
the  January  2020  combined  credit  report.  (Tr.  at  33,  35-36;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 2-6; AE B-D, F, G)
Applicant  paid  $218  and  $1,094  in  January  2020  to  resolve  the  $1,313  debt
alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.  He  paid  $300  and  $941  the  same  month  to  resolve  the  $1,241
debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. He paid $267, also in January 2020, to settle the $535 debt
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d. (Tr. at 31-34; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5, 6; AE B-D, G)
To  summarize,  Applicant  started  paying  his  debts  well  before  the  SOR  was
issued. He paid or settled all of the debts in the SOR, with the exception of the medical
debt. He also paid debts that were not alleged in the SOR. He has not received financial
counseling,  but  he  is  able  to  pay  his  current  bills  and  not  accrue  any  additional
delinquent debts. His January 2020 credit report lists the SOR debts that were recently
paid. It does not list any other delinquent debts. (Tr. at 21-22, 25-26, 29-31, 36-38; GE
2-6; AE E, G)
Applicant  submitted  letters  attesting  to  his  superior  job  performance.  He  is
praised for his good character, reliability, responsibility, dependability, and integrity. (AE
