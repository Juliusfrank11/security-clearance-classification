The SOR alleges two delinquent consumer debts totaling $86,419 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-
1.b). The debts are established by the 2016 and 2019 credit bureau reports. Applicant
also  disclosed  and  discussed  his  debts  in  his  2016  security  clearance  application
(SCA). (GE 1-3)
SOR  ¶  1.a  is  for  a  $73,299  charged-off  home  equity  line  of  credit  (HELOC).
Applicant purchased a condominium in 2006. He obtained a first mortgage for $300,000
and a $75,000 HELOC, and his mortgage payments were $2,200 monthly. From 2006
to 2015, he was current on his first mortgage and this HELOC. When he moved in 2014,
he obtained renters for his home and supplemented the rental income he received with
money from his retirement savings to make his mortgage payments from 2013 to 2015.
He  began  to  fall  behind  on  his  mortgage  in  2015.  He  telephoned  the  creditor  and
unsuccessfully  attempted  to  reach  a  payment  agreement.  He  then  unsuccessfully
attempted to  short sell his condominium with his realtor’s assistance  from 2016 until  it
was  foreclosed  and  auctioned  in  around  February  2017.  He  was  not  contacted  by
anyone  concerning  a  deficiency  balance  on  his  first  mortgage.  He  settled  the  HELOC
for $10,694, and paid it in December 2019.  (Tr. at 16, 20-23, 25-36, 42-51; GE 1, 3, 4;
