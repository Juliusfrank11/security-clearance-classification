Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant did not file his federal
income  tax  returns  on  time  for  the  2010  –  2017  tax  years,  and  as  a  result,  owes
$23,120.61 in past-due taxes (SOR 1.a). It was also alleged that Applicant filed a Chapter
7 bankruptcy petition in February 2013, declaring $188,638.02 in unsecured debts, and
that  he  was  discharged  of  his  debts  in  July  2013  (SOR  1.b).  Finally,  the  Government
alleged that Applicant had delinquent credit card debts of $2,739 (SOR 1.c) and $1,711
(SOR 1.d) to the same credit card company. In response to the SOR, Applicant denied
with explanations each of the allegations. (Answer; Tr. 10 – 11)
Applicant’s denials created issues of controverted fact as to SOR 1.a – 1.d, and
required  the  Government  to  produce  sufficient  reliable  information  to  establish  those
allegations as facts. (Directive, E3.1.14) The information presented in GX 1 - 8 satisfied
that  requirement  and  established  those  allegations  as  facts.  In  addition,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 58 years old and works in an information technology (IT) position for
a defense contractor. He was hired by his current employer in June 2019, and he has
worked in similar positions for defense contractors and for companies outside the defense
industry since December 1996. Applicant first received an industrial security clearance in
2007. (Answer; GX 1; AX L)
Applicant has been married twice. He and his first wife were married from March
1991 until 2004, when she abandoned the marriage, leaving him to raise their child (now
age 26). Applicant remarried in May 2006, creating a blended family with his wife and her
two children, now ages 25 and 28. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2)
When he submitted his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed much of the adverse financial
information addressed in the SOR. His financial problems began with the failure in 2011
of a small IT services business he had started in 2008. The business began as a part-
time venture at a time when his full-time defense contractor employment was unstable
due  to  government  contract  expirations  and  his  employer’s  organizational  changes.
Initially, Applicant ran the business from his home and it became successful enough that
he  relocated  to  a  commercial  space  and  hired  additional  employees.  Unfortunately,
starting  in  about  2010,  his  business  began  to  suffer  as  part  of  the  national  economic
downturn  and  he  had  to  close  the  business  in  2011.  A  subsequent  partnership  in  a
woodworking  business  in  2012  also  failed.  Applicant  had  financed  both  businesses
through the use of personal credit and he was unable to stay current on his repayment
obligations when the business closed. As alleged in SOR 1.b, in February 2013, Applicant
filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation of his debts, and he was discharged of his debts
in July 2013. (Answer; GX 1; GX 3; GX 5; AX E; Tr. 48 – 49, 61)
After July 2013, Applicant was beginning to recover financially when a series of
unexpected expenses arose. In January 2013, as a result of his bankruptcy, Applicant
and his family of five had to leave a house he had purchased in July 1991. They moved
into a three-bedroom, two-bathroom house that initially was big enough for all of them.
Later in 2013, Applicant’s grandfather, who lived about two hours away, became ill and
could  not  care  for  himself.  Applicant  was  the  nearest  relative  who  could  help  his
grandfather and began traveling to see him on a regular basis. Applicant lost time and
income from work, and he bore the costs of some of his grandfather’s medical expenses.
Additionally, because Applicant is legally blind and cannot drive, his wife also had to take
time off from work to drive him. In 2015, Applicant’s grandfather was relocated to a nearby
skilled nursing facility where he died three years later. (Answer; GX 3; AX O; Tr. 49 – 51)
Also in 2013, Applicant’s mother became ill and was hospitalized in an adjoining
state. After she was transferred to a hospital and recovery facility in Applicant’s state, he
often had to drive three hours to tend to her. Later that year, she moved in with Applicant
and his family. As noted above, the house Applicant was renting at the time was large
enough  for  his  family  of  five  when  they  moved  in  at  the  beginning  of  2013.  It  quickly
became too small to house six adults (Applicant’s child and stepchildren were in their 20s
by 2013). Applicant and his wife moved to a larger house that commanded a significantly
higher monthly rent. At this point, Applicant’s wife had been unemployed for several years
because of medical issues and Applicant was relying too much on credit cards to make
ends meet. In 2016, Applicant and his family moved to a house with lower rent. His mother
lived with him and his family until she died in 2017. Applicant’s wife regained employment
in  2014,  and  by  2018,  Applicant’s  own  employment  had  stabilized.  He  and  his  wife
recently  qualified  for  mortgage  financing  and  hope  to  buy  a  house  in  2020.  Applicant
meets  all  of  his  current  obligations  and  estimates  he  has  between  $500  and  $750
remaining each month after expenses, which include his IRS payments. (Answer; GX 3;
HX 3; Tr. 54 – 56)
Applicant did not file his income tax returns on time for the tax years 2011 through
2017. In each year, he requested an extension of the April 15 filing deadline; however, he
only filed his 2011 returns before the extension expired. He did not file his federal returns
for 2012 through 2017 until December 2018. He filed his 2018 returns on time and, as of
his hearing, he expected to file his 2019 return by the end of February 2020. Applicant
did not file his returns as required because he was either personally overwhelmed by the
stresses of his personal life or, more recently, he could not afford to pay an accountant to
compile and file his tax returns. As a result, Applicant owes in excess of $23,000 in unpaid
taxes. Applicant began taking action to file his returns and pay his past-due taxes in late
2018. Once his returns were filed, his accountant negotiated a repayment plan with the
IRS in May 2019. That effort was delayed by a federal government shutdown in December
2018  and  January  2019.  Since  July  2019,  Applicant  has  paid  $341  each  month  as
required by the plan. (Answer; GX 1 – 3; AX V; Tr. 52 – 53, 57 – 61)
Applicant  also  has  resolved  the  debts  alleged  at  SOR  1.c  and  1.d.  They  were
delinquent credit card debts Applicant accrued in late 2015. He was able to resolve the
debt  at  SOR 1.c through settlement  in  January  2017. As to  SOR  1.d, he had  difficulty
communicating with the collection agency that owned the account. In January 2020, he
resolved  the  debt  by paying a lesser  amount  agreed to  by the  creditor  in  a settlement
agreement. (Answer; GX 1 – 3; GX 6 – 8; AX F; AX G; AX N; AX P – R; AX X; Tr. 61 –
64)
Applicant  has  an  excellent  reputation  with  friends  and  co-workers.  Information
about  his  performance  at  his  last  two  employers  reflects  reliability,  hard  work,  and
professionalism. People who have known Applicant for most of the past 20 years feel he
has the requisite integrity, honesty, and trustworthiness to occupy a position of trust. A
co-worker who has known Applicant since 1998 has personally observed Applicant as a
single father who endeavors to act responsibly and who has always been reliable. (AX H
– K, AX M; Tr. 44 – 47)
