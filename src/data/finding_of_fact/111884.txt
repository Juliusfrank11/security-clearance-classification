Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, except the allegation in ¶ 3.a. After
a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 36 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2008. He is not married
and has no children. He was employed from May 2008 to October 2013,  with a private
company. He then worked from October 2013 to July 2016, for a federal contractor. He
left  this  job  because  he  was  having  difficulties  with  his  alcohol use,  and  he  voluntarily
enrolled in an alcohol recovery program where he was a patient for one month. After his
discharge,  he  was  unemployed  for  eight  months  before  starting  work  with  his  current
employer in March 2017. (Items 2, 3, 4, 6)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  March  2010  for  possession  of  marijuana.  He  was  on
probation for a year and completed a drug rehabilitation course. The charge was nolle
prossed.  During  his  August  2018  background  interview,  he  told  the  government
investigator that after his arrest he had no intention of being involved with illegal drugs
again. He made changes in his life and found more positive outlets for his time. There is
no evidence of subsequent drug involvement. (Item 5, 7)
Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in August
2012.  The  charge  was  nolle  prossed.  He  has  had  no  other  alcohol-related  incidents.
Applicant continued to consume alcohol after his arrest, drinking four to six drinks a night.
He  decided  to  address  his  alcohol  consumption  and  voluntarily  entered  an  alcohol
rehabilitation  program  in  July  2016.  This  coincided  with  him  leaving  his  job  and
subsequent unemployment. He was diagnosed by a medical doctor with alcohol abuse
disorder.  He  successfully  completed  the  rehabilitation  program.  He  indicated  in  his
answer  to  government  interrogatories  that  he  has  not  consumed  alcohol  since  August
2016. There is no evidence to the contrary. (Items 4, 5, 7)
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  in  August  2017.
Section 22 asked if he had ever been charged with an offense involving drugs or alcohol.
Applicant  failed  to  disclose  his  marijuana  arrest  and  his  DUI.  In  his  SOR  answer,  he
explained that he misread the question believing it asked him if he had been convicted of
these  type  of  offenses.  I  found  his  explanation  credible  and  conclude  he  did  not
intentionally fail to disclose the requested information. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5)
The SOR alleges 29 delinquent debts totaling approximately $165,742. Applicant
admitted owing all of the debts. He was confronted with many of these debts during his
background interviews. He indicated his willingness to pay his debts and attributed them
to poor decisions he made when he was consuming alcohol. He was going to look into
the debts and work to resolve them. (Items 3, 4, 5, 8, 9)
In  June  2019,  Applicant  began  working  with  a  law  firm  to  help  him  dispute  and
settle his delinquent debts. He provided a copy of the agreement and information included
to show he had disputed certain debts that were removed from his credit report. He has
delinquent  student  loans  that  total  approximately  $117,598  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b;  this
amount is included in the overall delinquent debt balance). It appears he has two debts
owed for vehicles (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-$12,848 and 1.n-$17,688); numerous medical debts (SOR
¶¶  1.d-$8,051;  1.i-$351;  1.p-$720;  1.s-$409;  1.v-$132;  1.x-$92;  1.y-$80;  1.z-$80;  1.aa
$65; 1.bb-$60 and 1.cc-$39); delinquent rent (SOR ¶ 1.e-$2,218); and other consumer
and payday loans. (Items 2, 4, 5, 8, 9)
Applicant did not provide information that any of the alleged SOR debts have been
settled  or  paid.  The  document  he  provided  showed  that  nine  debts  were  removed,
presumably from his credit report. Only one debt removed may possibly be included in
the SOR, but the only information noted is that the creditor is “medical.” It does not specify
the amount of the medical debt or the collector. The other debts removed do not appear
to be those included in the SOR. Applicant did not provide any evidence to identify if any
other debts removed were alleged in the SOR. He did not provide any other information
about whether he has paid any of these debts, even the smallest ones. (Items 2, 4, 5, 8,
9)
During his background interview, Applicant indicated that his finances were stable,
and he was working to better manage them. He did not provide a budget or any other
information  about  his  finances  or  any  proof  that  he  has  paid  or  settled  any  of  his
delinquent  debts.  Applicant  received  his  college  degree  in  2008.  He  provided  no
explanation for his failure to make payments on his student loans when due and while he
was  employed.  He  indicated  to  the  government  investigator  that  he  was  making
arrangements to pay his student loans. He did not provide evidence that he has done so.
