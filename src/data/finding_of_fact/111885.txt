Applicant, age 38, is single after two marriages and has two children. He graduated
from high school in 2000. He enlisted in the military (United States Marine Corps) in July
2000  but  in  February  2001,  he  received  a  discharge  under  medical  conditions  which
prevented  him  from  completing  training.  Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance
application on July 16, 2018. (Item 3)  He is currently working for a federal contractor,
which he started in 2018. He seeks to obtain a security clearance.
The SOR alleges that Applicant has three delinquent debts.  The first two are child
support  arrears  in  two  states  totaling  approximately  $82,000.  (Item  1).  The  third  is  a
telecommunications  collection  account  in  the  amount  of  $836.  Applicant  admits  the
alleged delinquent debts (SOR paragraphs 1.a through c.) (Item 2) His 2019 credit report
confirms the three SOR allegations. (Item 5)
Applicant  attributes  the  child  support  arrears  to  insufficient  income  since  2006.
(Item 3) He did not have enough money to pay the full amount of child support, which is
$100 monthly for each state. His wages have been garnished since 2013, but arrears still
exist. He noted the amount of $60,000 on his security clearance application. He worked
with Lexington Law to help repair his credit, but he stopped working with them in 2018.
(Item 4)
Applicant reported one period of unemployment from July 2012 to February 2013.
He has worked steadily since that time. He has lived with his parents from February 2013
until August 2018. He now lives with his sister. (Item 3)
Applicant  presented  no  information  as  to  the  current  status  of  any  of  the  debts
alleged.  He  did  not  report  any  contact  with  the  creditor  for  the  collection  account.  He
intends to pay his bills in the future. He provided no information or documentation of any
payments  he  may  have  made  regarding  child  support.  In  his  subject  interview,  he
disclosed that he had about $3,000 in medical debt. (Item 4) He stated that he plans to
set up payment arrangements.
There is  no information in  the record  concerning  his  earnings or  that  he  uses a
budget or that he is now seeking financial counseling. He described his financial situation
as “fair.” (Item 4)
