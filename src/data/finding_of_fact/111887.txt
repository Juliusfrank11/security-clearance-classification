Having  thoroughly  considered  the  evidence  in  the  record,  including  Applicant's
admissions, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant  is  33  years  old.  He  is  unmarried  and  does  not  have  any  children.
Applicant is employed by a medical service company. He was hired in June 2018 as a
unit  coordinator.  Prior  to  this  employment,  he  had  been  unemployed  from  November
2017  until  June  2018.  He  received  unemployment  benefits  during  a  portion  of  his
unemployment period. Applicant attended three years of college and stopped attending
in 2015 due to family reasons. At the time he withdrew, he was majoring in physiology,
and  his  grade  point  average  was  3.62.  Applicant’s  current  monthly  take-home  pay  is
approximately  $2,000.  His  employer  requires  him  to  be  issued  a  trustworthiness
determination in order to continue his employment. (Tr. 14-18, 22-23; GE 1)
In  2012,  Applicant  began  to  experience  financial  difficulties  following  his
hospitalization for a blood clot. From 2013 to November 2017, he was  underemployed,
working less  than  20  hours  a  week,  by  a national appliance  store  for  minimal  pay.  He
testified that, until recently, he was not educated about financial matters. The first time
he  looked  at  a  credit  report  occurred  during  his  January  2019  background  interview.
Once he realized the amount of his debt, he immediately contacted all of his creditors to
begin resolving his debts. He hopes one day he will be able to purchase a house, and
he  cannot  have  lingering  past-due  debt  if  he  is  to  achieve  this  goal.  He  values  his
employment, and he is grateful for earning a decent income for the first time in his life.
(Tr. 19-21, 37-38)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a-f allege six delinquent Department of Education student loans placed
for collection in the amount of $34,190. Applicant admitted all of the student loans in his
SOR response.  After he withdrew from college due to family reasons, his student loans
became due immediately, which he could not afford to pay. He testified that he did pay
on  his  student  loans  for  a  short  period  of  time  while  working  part-time,  but  he  had  to
stop after he was unable to afford the payments. Applicant stated that he started paying
his student loans again after his January 2019 background interview. He is paying $5 a
month  to  rehabilitate  his  student  loans.  He  has  maintained  regular  payments  for
approximately  one  year.  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  did  not  have  any  documentation  to
verify his claim. Post-hearing documentation showed he has consistently made monthly
payments from February 2019 to January 2020. (Tr. 25-32, AE A)
SOR  ¶¶  1.g  and  1.h  are  duplicate  accounts  for  an  unpaid  cell  phone  service
account in  the  amount  of  about $763.  Applicant  provided  documentation  with  his  SOR
response showing that he settled this account in November 2019 after he paid less than
the full balance. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 32; SOR response attachment)
SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j allege two unpaid medical accounts totaling $1,502. Applicant
testified that these accounts are related to his hospital stay in 2012. He  stated that he
had  been  paying  on  these  medical  accounts  after  he  completed  his  background
interview  in  January  2019,  and  he  made  regular  monthly  payments  for  approximately
one year. At the hearing, Applicant did not have any documentation to verify his claim.
Post-hearing  documentation  showed  from  February  2019  to  January  2020,  Applicant
consistently made payments, totaling approximately $65, on his two delinquent medical
accounts. (Tr. 34-36; AE A)
On  March  17,  2020,  Applicant  submitted  a  bank  account  snapshot  showing
regular  payments  for  his  student  loans  and  medical  accounts  from  February  2019
through  January  2020.  He  submitted a  current  employee  performance  appraisal  which
showed he was highly ranked as an “Outstanding Contributor” for his employer. He also
sent his monthly budget which showed that he had not accumulated any new debt. After
paying  all  of  his  monthly  expenses,  Applicant  is  able  to  deposit  approximately  $130  a
month into his savings account. (AE A, AE B, AE C)
