Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with explanations. After a thorough
and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 42 years old. She married in 2004 and divorced in 2011. She has a
12-year-old son from the marriage. She has cohabitated with her fiancé since 2011. She
disclosed in her June 2018 security clearance application (SCA) that she was employed
from  August  2006  to  October  2014;  unemployed  from  October  2014  to  August  2015;
employed from  August  2015 to  June  2016;  unemployed  from  June 2016  to  December
2016;  and  employed  from  December  2016  to  December  2017,  when  she  began  her
current employment with a federal contractor. (Items 3, 4)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  August  2018.  She
attributed  her  financial  difficulties  to  her  2011  divorce,  periods  of  unemployment,  and
medical issues that began in 2011 and required surgery in 2014, which caused her to be
out  of  work  for  several  months  under  the  Family  and  Medical  Leave  Act  (FMLA).  She
indicated  that  she  won  a  settlement  from  her  employer  for  being  terminated  while  on
FMLA. She did not disclose the details of the settlement. (Item 4)
Applicant told the investigator that she had timely filed her 2014 federal income tax
returns and most of her tax debt was due to an early withdrawal of approximately $68,200
from her 401k retirement account. She had timely filed her 2015 and 2016 federal income
tax returns without owing additional taxes. Her 2015 federal tax refund was applied to an
unknown non-IRS debt.
In  response  to  Government  interrogatories,  Applicant  disclosed  that  she  owed
approximately $7,868 to the IRS for tax year 2014 and that she had not timely filed her
2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns. She stated she filed her 2017 and 2018 federal
tax returns late because she had moved. She also attributed her failure to timely file and
pay her federal and state income taxes to a lack of money as a result of her 2011 divorce,
medical issues, and job loss.
Applicant provided mail tracking numbers, presumably to show that she mailed her
2017  federal  and  state  tax  returns  on  March  15,  2020.  She  provided  a  copy  of  her
TurboTax balance sheet for 2017 for state and federal tax returns (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c).
She  filed  her  2018  federal  tax  return  approximately  five  months  late,  but  did  not  owe
additional taxes. She provided documents to show she also filed her 2018 state tax return.
In addition, a document from the IRS from September 2019, noted that a state refund of
$639 was seized and applied to Applicant’s federal tax debt (SOR ¶ 1.d). (Items 2, 4; AE
F, G, H, I, J)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she stated that she established a payment plan
with the IRS in September 2019, which was to begin in November 2019, whereby she
would make monthly payments of $300 towards her delinquent tax debt. In her response
to the FORM, she provided documents to show she has been making the payments and
her tax debt balance as of March 2020 was $6,150. (Item 2, AE A).
The  SOR  debts  are  corroborated  by  Applicant’s  disclosures,  admissions,  and
credit reports from August 2018 and March 2019. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
The  SOR  alleged  student  loan  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.i  ($703),  1.n  ($256)  and  1.p
($100).  Applicant  provided  a  document  from  March  2020  from  the  state  where  she
previously lived notifying her that a state tax refund of $702 was intercepted and applied
to  her  delinquent  student  loans.  She  provided  a  document  from  the  Department  of
Education agreeing to accept a payment of $1,000 as settlement for her delinquent loans.
Applicant wrote on the document that she had made three payments, the last in March
2020 to settle the debt. She also provided confirmation numbers. (AE D, E)
Applicant provided a document dated August 2019, indicating her debt owed to the
creditor in SOR ¶ 1.e ($1,720) was paid in full. (AE C).
Applicant disclosed in her SCA numerous medical debts from 2016 and indicated
they were “pending payment”, but she had taken no action to resolve them. During her
background interview, she stated that she had numerous medical bills, some dating back
to  2012.  She  was  attempting  to  pay  some  smaller  bills.  Applicant  did  not  provide  any
evidence  regarding  the  status  of  the  medical  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.f  ($965),  1.g
($814), 1.h ($710), 1.j ($560), 1.l ($470), and 1.o ($221). She did not provide any evidence
regarding the status of the consumer debts owed in SOR ¶¶ 1.k ($526) and 1.m ($423).
