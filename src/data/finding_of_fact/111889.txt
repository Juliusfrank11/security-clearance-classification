Applicant,  age  43,  has  four  adult  children.  She  divorced  in  February  2012  after
four  years  of  marriage,  and  remarried  in  June  2018.  She  served  on  active  duty  from
1994  through  1996  with  the  U.S.  Marine  Corps,  and  from  2003  through  2006  with  the
U.S. Army. She earned an associate degree in 2008 and a nurse-aid certificate in 2017.
She  has  been  employed  by  a  military  medical  center  since  June  2018.  She  reported
that she was granted a DOD security clearance in 2017. However, it is unclear from the
record  on  what  basis  it  was  granted  since  she  was  not  then  employed  by  a  defense
contractor. (Items 1, 3)
Applicant  admitted  each  of  the  11  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR,  which  totaled
$64,521.  She  has  not paid  any of  those  debts.  In  her  SOR  answer,  Applicant  claimed
that  1)  she  was  in  negotiations  to  settle  the  debts  alleged in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.i,  and  1.j,
and 2) the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.h and 1.k had been removed from her
credit report. She did not provide documents sufficient to corroborate either claim. Only
three  of  the  alleged  debts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.c)  appear  on  her  most  recent  credit
report. (AE A, B; Items 1, 7)
Applicant’s credit reports dated June 2018 and August 2019 confirm each of the
alleged  debts.  The  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  1.e,  and  1.i  through  1.k  are
individual  accounts  (totaling  $39,002)  and  the  remaining  alleged  debts  are  joint
accounts  (totaling  $25,519).  All  but  one  of  the  joint  accounts  was  opened  during  the
Applicant’s first marriage. For reasons not specified in the record, the joint debt alleged
in SOR ¶ 1.c. was opened after the divorce. (Items 6, 7)
Applicant  engaged  the  services  of  a  credit  repair  company  to  assist  her  with
correcting what she described as “inaccuracies” in her credit reports. She asserted that
the  inaccuracies  related  to  reporting  debts  for  which  her  former  spouse  was  solely
responsible.  In  letters  dated  January  and  October  2019,  the  company  proffered  that
Applicant  “has  a  responsible  credit  history”  and  that  it  initiated  a  case  against  “the
creditors involved” in order “to prove that her credit report contains major discrepancies
through  no  fault  of  her  own.”  Neither  Applicant  nor  the  company  specified  details  or
provided documents to corroborate their claims. There is no evidence in the record that
Applicant received financial counseling from the company or elsewhere. (AE A, B; Item
2 at 13)
Applicant  was  not  aware  that  her  home  mortgage  was  delinquent  until  her  first
husband  petitioned  for  divorce  in  September  2011.  The  foreclosure  alleged  in  SOR  ¶
1.h  was  finalized  sometime  in  2012.  When  confronted  during  her  2018  SI,  Applicant
asserted that she had no knowledge of the delinquent status of the accounts alleged in
SOR ¶ 1.a, 1.c through 1.g, and 1.i through 1.k. She maintained that those accounts all
belonged  to  her  former  spouse,  who  managed  their  finances  during  the  marriage
without consulting her or allowing her to see any records. (Item 3 at 5-6)
Applicant answered “No” to each of the questions in the financial record section
of her 2018 SCA and did not otherwise disclose her foreclosure or any delinquent debts
therein.  Five  of  the  six  individual  accounts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  1.e,  1.i,  and  1.j)  were  in
delinquent  status  well  before  she  completed her  2018  SCA.  Applicant  did  not  address
during her SI or elsewhere in the record why she failed to report the foreclosure or her
then delinquent individual accounts on her SCA. The omissions were not alleged in the
SOR and will be considered only for the purpose of evaluating mitigation and the whole
person concept. (Item 2 at 33-35; Item 3 at 5; Items 6, 7)
