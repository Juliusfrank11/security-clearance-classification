honorably  discharged  in  1985.  He  was  married  in  1985  and  divorced  in  1995;  again

The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  owes  approximately  $29,000  in  delinquent  debts.
Applicant admitted all of the allegations, and stated in his Answer to the SOR that he was
unaware of some of the medical debts alleged. He noted that he was generally current
on all of his debts until about January 2018, when he was unable to make ends meet and
had to choose which debts to pay.
Applicant has not addressed any of the SOR debts. He lives from paycheck -to -
paycheck and has little to no savings. He used $18,000 in his retirement plan  to pay a
debt in 2018, and owns a house valued at $150,000 with a mortgage of $126,000. He is
paying his mortgage, car loan, and student loans (owes $11,000) on time, but is unable
to make payments on other debts. He testified that he was told by his employer that he
should not seek financial counseling or bankruptcy protection, as it would preclude him
from  receiving  a  security  clearance.  Regardless,  Applicant  has  had  no  contact  with
creditors nor has he made attempts to resolve his debts.
Applicant and his spouse are both working, and earn about $65,500 in net pay. He
is supported by his team lead and human resources manager. Both believe Applicant is
an employee in good standing, trustworthy, and well-liked by the soldiers he serves.
