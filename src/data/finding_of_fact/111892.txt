In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  32-year-old  field  engineer  employed  by  a  defense  contractor.  He
served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from May 2009 to May 2015. At the hearing, he
described  himself  as  a  “great  technician  but  a  mediocre  sailor.”  (Tr.  36.)  He  received
nonjudicial punishment in August 2014 for a one-day unauthorized absence. (GX 1 at 19;
Tr. 36-37.) He received an honorable discharge but was ineligible to reenlist. (Tr. 27.) He
held a security clearance while in the Navy. He was unemployed from May 2015 until he
was hired for his current job in March 2016.
Applicant  attended  a  university  from  August  2006  to  December  2007.  After  his
discharge from  the Navy, he  attended a university from June  to  November 2015, using
his GI Bill  benefits,  but he  did not receive a degree. (Tr. 37-38.)  He  is  currently taking
college courses and  seeking a bachelor’s degree in  engineering. (Tr. 34.)  (AX C and  D.)
The   GI  Bill   pays  for  the  college  courses  and  he  receives  $1,733   per  month   for   living
expenses.  (AX  K.)  His  current  annual   salary  is  about   $72,000,  plus  overtime  which   is
usually about ten hours  per week.  He is paid his regular hourly rate for overtime. (Tr. 42-
44)
Applicant married in January 2011 and divorced in October 2011. He married again
in February 2015, separated in February 2018, and divorced in December 2019. (Tr. 39.)
His  second  ex-wife  obtained a protective order  in September  2018 for  family abuse in
which a weapon was involved. (AX N.) He reported the protective order to his supervisors
and stated that his ex-wife obtained it to “seek advantage and get him out of the house.”
(GX 4.)
Applicant  has a nine-year-old child from his first  marriage, and  two children, ages
five and  four, from his second  marriage. He testified that he was not the father of the five-
year-old  child but raised  her as his own. (Tr. 29.)  He  pays child support  totaling $1,400
per month for all three children. (Tr. 40.)
Applicant was deployed three times during his second marriage, for periods of six
months,  two  and  a  half  months,  and  four  months.  (Tr.  45.)  He  received  a  letter  of
appreciation for his exceptional performance during his last deployment. (AX L.)
The  SOR  alleges  five  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $39,000.  The  debts  are
reflected in credit reports from June 2019 and October 2018 (GX 2 and 3.) The evidence
concerning these debts is summarized below.
SOR  ¶  1.a:  deficiency of  $23,362  after  repossession  of  a  vehicle.  Applicant
purchased this vehicle in August 2017 for his second ex-wife. Applicant signed the loan
and his mother cosigned it. Applicant made the first payment and counted on his ex-wife
to make subsequent payments. The vehicle was repossessed in January 2018 because
his ex-wife did not make any payments even though Applicant sent her the funds for that
purpose. He knew when the repossession occurred because his neighbor knocked on the
door and told him that the vehicle had just been towed away. He asked his then wife if
she had been making the payments and she replied that she had not. (Tr. 46-47.)
In July 2018, Applicant informed his employer about the repossession, some other
financial delinquencies, and a protective order against him obtained by his then wife. (GX
4.) When Applicant answered the SOR in November 2019, he stated that he was unable
to redeem the vehicle because he was catching up on other bills such as his mortgage
payments, utility bills, and car payments that were also three or four months past due. He
did  not  contact  the  lender  for  the  repossessed  vehicle  until  about  a  week  before  the
hearing. He testified that he did not contact the lender earlier, because he was waiting
until the vehicle was sold so that the amount due could be calculated. (Tr. 46-49.) After
the  hearing,  he  contacted  the  creditor  about  a  payment  agreement  and  made  a  $100
payment on this debt. As of the date the record closed, Applicant and the creditor had not
reached an agreement on the amount due or a payment plan. (AX Y; AX BB.)

trusted  his  ex-wife
SOR ¶ 1.b: delinquent vehicle loan placed  for collection of  $10,996.  In April
2018, while Applicant  and  his then wife were  separated, he  bought an inexpensive used
car for  her  after the first one  was repossessed, because he did not want her and  their
children to be stranded  without transportation.  He  obtained the loan in  his name and  his
ex-wife’s. His ex-wife agreed to make the  payments, which were around $360  per  month.
He
the   payments,  notwithstanding  her  previous
irresponsibility.   She  surrendered  the  vehicle   instead  of  making   any  payments.   (Tr.  52-
53.)  She  filed  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  petition  in   January  2019.  She  converted  her
bankruptcy to a  Chapter  7 in  April 2019. The  bankruptcy petition was filed solely in  his ex-
wife’s name. (AX P.) Applicant was notified of  the bankruptcy filing by mail,  because he
and  his ex-wife are co-owners of the marital home, where Applicant currently lives. (Tr.
64.) He  believes he will  be responsible for  part  of  the  debt even if his ex-wife obtains a
Chapter  7  discharge.   (Tr.  52-54.)   He   testified  that  he  expected  the  bankruptcy  to  be
completed “within the next few months,”  but that his  ex-wife and  her bankruptcy attorney
refused to give him any information. (Tr. 63-64.) The record does not reflect the status of
the bankruptcy.  After the hearing,  Applicant  contacted the creditor in  an effort  to  negotiate
a  payment  agreement  or  settlement.  As  of  the  date  the  record  closed,  he  had  not  yet
reached an agreement or made any payments. (AX BB.)
SOR ¶ 1.c: unsecured personal loan charged off for $1,894. Applicant testified
that  he  obtained  this  loan  early  in  his  Navy  service,  around  2013.  He  testified,  “I  was
young, I wasn’t smart with money. I wanted to buy the newest video game system at the
time.” He  took no action to resolve this debt because he had  “other  things that kind of
took  precedence.”  (Tr.  56.)  He  made  a  $150  payment  on  September  1,  2020,  and  he
testified that he intends to continue making payments until the debt is satisfied. (AX M;
Tr. 56-57.) He does not have a formal payment agreement. (Tr. 66.) In his post-hearing
statement, he promised that the debt will be resolved by the end of October 2020. (AX
BB.)
SOR  ¶  1.d:  cellphone  account  placed  for  collection  of  $1,303.  The  October
2018 credit report reflects that this account  was placed for collection in October 2018.
(GX 3 at 5.) In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he disputed this debt because
he turned off his cellphone while he was deployed while on active duty in 2009 or 2010,
but the provider continued to charge him for the service. (Tr. 66-67.) It is not reflected in
the June 2019 credit report submitted by Department Counsel or the September 2020
credit report submitted by Applicant. (GX 3; AX O.) At the hearing, he testified that he did
not intend to pay this debt, because it was not reflected in the credit reports. (Tr. 75.) After
the  hearing,  he  submitted  documentary  evidence  that  the  debt  was  paid  and  that  the
creditor submitted a request that the account be deleted from his credit record. (AX W.)
SOR  ¶  1.e:   cellphone   account  placed   for  collection  of  $1,501.  Applicant
testified that he disputed this account because it was in  another person’s name  who used
his Social Security number. (Tr.  66-67.) He  testified that he  did not  intend to  pay this debt
for  the same reason that he did not intend to pay the debt alleged in  SOR ¶ 1.d, i.e.,  it
was  not  reflected  in   the  credit  reports.  After  the   hearing,  he  submitted  documentary
evidence that he had paid the debt on September 11, 2020. (AX X.)
After the hearing, Applicant submitted evidence that he filed a dispute in February
2020  and  another  on  September  15,  2020.  (AX  Z.)  However,  the  document  does  not
reflect the debts being disputed, the basis for the disputes, or the results of the disputes.
Applicant’s  stepfather  testified  for  Applicant.  (He  was  erroneously  identified  as
Applicant’s  father-in-law during the hearing.) He  testified that Applicant’s ex-wife called
Applicant’s  mother  while  Applicant  was  deployed  and  asked  for  a  loan  to  pay  bills.
Applicant’s mother lent Applicant’s ex-wife $2,400 to pay bills and later discovered that
she  deposited  the  money  in  an  account  and  did  not  pay  the  bills.  (Tr.  20.)  Applicant’s
stepfather testified that when Applicant returned from deployment he found that his then
wife  had  moved  out  of  the  marital  home  and  taken  all  the  furniture  with  her.  (Tr.  23.)
Applicant’s stepfather later loaned Applicant about $7,000 to hire a divorce lawyer. (Tr.
21.)
Applicant  recently  purchased  a  seven-year-old  vehicle  when  his  old  one  broke
down. He borrowed money from a friend for the down payment. His monthly payments
on the loan are $363. (Tr. 60-61.)
Applicant’s personal financial statement from August 31, 2020, reflects net monthly
income of $4,653, expenses of $4,504, and a net remainder of $159. It does not include
the income of $1,733 he receives under the GI Bill for living expenses. (Tr. 59-60.) The
listed expenses include child support of $1,400, a $150 payment to the creditor alleged
in SOR ¶ 1.c, and monthly payments on the vehicle that Applicant recently purchased. It
also  reflects  monthly  savings  of  $50,  leaving  $109  in  discretionary  income.  (AX  B.)
Applicant estimated that he has borrowed about $2,000 from his mother and has repaid
her about $600 or $700. (Tr. 61-62.) He has not repaid his father for the $7,000 loan for
attorney’s fees. (Tr. 21.) Applicant’s FICO scores in September 2020 ranged from 562 to
626, in the “fair” range. (AX Q-U, AA.)
