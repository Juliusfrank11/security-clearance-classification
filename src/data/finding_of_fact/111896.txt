In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comments, all of the SOR
allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.d.). His silence
in  failing  to  answer the  amended  SOR  ¶  1.a.  is considered  a  denial  of  that allegation.
Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and
thorough  review  of  the  evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon due  consideration of  same, I
make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  a  security  officer  with  his  current  employer  since  September  2017.  He  previously
served with the U.S. Navy on active duty from April 1997 until May 2011, and in the U.S.
Naval Reserve from May 2011 until July 2017, when he retired honorably as a  leading
petty officer (E-6). His is a 1995 high school graduate. He was granted a secret clearance
in 2013. He was married in 2000. He has three biological children, born in 1996 and 2001,
as well as two adopted children, born in 2008 and 2009.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can  be  found  in  the  following  exhibits:  Item  6  (Combined  Experian,  TransUnion,  and
Equifax Credit Report, dated April 26, 2018); Item 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated July
16,  2019);  Item  4  (Enhanced  Subject  Interview,  dated  January  23,  2019);  and  Item  2
(Applicant’s Answer to SOR, dated October 7, 2019).
Applicant noted that upon retiring in July 2017, he was unemployed for two months
until he was able to obtain his current employment. During that brief period, he spent time
working on home projects. His financial needs were taken care of by his terminal leave
salary and his wife’s salary. (Item 4, at 5) He attributed his financial problems to a variety
of factors: he was not always financially responsible; during 2015 or 2016 while he was
aboard ship, because of a medical issue and missed work, his wife failed to make some
monthly mortgage payments; and on a rental property, he was unable to find stable and
consistent tenants. (Item 4, at 8-10)
The SOR, as amended, alleged four delinquent accounts totaling approximately
$243,000, as set forth as follows: SOR ¶ 1.a. is a mortgage loan on his current residence
that was initially charged off but eventually foreclosed with an unpaid balance of $162,358
(Item 5, at 1; Item 4, at 9); SOR ¶ 1.b. is a second mortgage loan on his current residence
that had an unpaid balance of approximately $74,000, of which nearly $17,000 was past
due,  and  was  eventually  foreclosed,  leaving  an  unpaid  deficiency  balance  of  nearly
$17,000 (Item 6, at 5, 8; Item 5, at 2; Item 4, at 9-10); SOR ¶ 1.c. is an unspecified type
of account with an unpaid balance of nearly $43,000 that was charged off (Item 6, at 10;
Item 5, at 2; Item 4, at 9); and SOR ¶ 1.d. is a mortgage loan on a former rental property
with  an  unpaid  balance  of  over  $409,000  that  was  foreclosed,  leaving  an  unpaid
deficiency balance of nearly $21,000. (Item 6, at 5; Item 5, at 1; Item 4, at 10)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  also  had  financial  difficulties  associated  with  a
residence where he lived from 2003 until 2011, but that he was able to save the property
from foreclosure by selling the property at a short sale.
It is noted that despite Applicant’s inability to maintain the four accounts alleged in
the SOR in a current status because of insufficient funds to do so, he managed to take
two personal trips, outside of government travel, to the Bahamas for six to ten days in
November 2017, and again to the Bahamas for one to five days in December 2017. (Item
4, at 7)
Applicant contends that his mortgage is currently paid up to date, and that he is
able  to  make  all  payments  on  time.  His  current  residence  is  the  same  one  that  was
previously foreclosed, and he did not offer any explanation as to how the property was
retrieved from foreclosure. (Item 3, at 9; FORM Receipt, dated November 7, 2019) Other
than Applicant’s unverified contentions regarding his expenses and his efforts to resolve
certain delinquent accounts, there is no documentary evidence to support that Applicant
made  any  efforts  to  address  any  of  his  delinquent  accounts.  In  the  absence  of
documentation, I conclude that Applicant’s delinquent accounts have not been resolved.
It is not known what Applicant’s current financial resources may be because he did
not report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder
that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a
budget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of additional financial
information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position
financially than he had been.
