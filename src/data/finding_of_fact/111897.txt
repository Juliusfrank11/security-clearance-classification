Financial Considerations

24; GE 1; GE 5 at 4) Applicant timely filed and paid her federal and state income taxes.
(Tr. 47-48)
The  debts  listed  in  the  SOR  are  documented  in  her  SCA,  credit  reports,  or  her
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), or in more than
one of these documents. (GE 1-5) The SOR alleges 24 delinquent debts totaling $52,588.
After  subtracting  the  three  withdrawn  SOR  allegations  in  ¶¶  1.p,  1.q,  and  1.u,  21
delinquent debts totaling $47,624 remain, and their status is as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant owes $12,866 for a charged-off debt. Applicant
and her husband financed a vehicle in 2011 as a joint account. (Tr. 24-25; GE 4 at 4)
They  were  unable  to  afford  the  payments,  and  they  had  the  vehicle  voluntarily
repossessed in 2012. (Tr. 24-25; GE 5 at 4) The date of the last payment is September
2015. (GE 4 at 4) Applicant’s spouse is the primary account holder, and Applicant has
responsibility  as  a  joint  account  holder.  (AE  G  at  2)  Two  months  before  her  hearing,

Applicant left an apartment before her lease ended. (Tr. 27) She made $50 payments in
September,  October, and  November  2019.  (Tr.  27-28;  AE  F)  Her  November  15,  2019
credit report indicates a different collection agent than the SOR, a balance of $2,511, and
in the comments, it states that the Applicant disputes the account information. (GE 4 at
2)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges that Applicant owes $2,083 for a charged-off debt. She rented-
to-buy  a dinette  set  in  October 2016,  and  her  most  recent payment  was  made  in  May

2016, to May 2017, Applicant and her spouse made eight payments totaling $1,144. (AE

debt.  (AE  G  at  11)  On  January  10,  2020,  the  creditor  confirmed  the  balance  owed  is
$1,061. (AE G at 1-2) Applicant’s husband accepted responsibility for this debt, and he
said he intend to resolve this debt with one payment. (AE G at 6) If Applicant’s husband
does not pay this debt, Applicant said she intends to pay it. (AE C)
SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  that  Applicant  has  a  telecommunications  debt  placed  for
collection for $1,964. Her November 15, 2019 credit report indicates a balance of $1,964,
and in the comments, it states that the Applicant disputes the account information. (GE 4
at 2) On January 7, 2020, Applicant agreed to a payment plan the creditor proposed to
make monthly $30 payments beginning on January 15, 2020, until the debt is paid. (AE

SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 1.m, and 1.n allege that Applicant has three medical debts placed for

SOR ¶ 1.l alleges that Applicant has a debt placed for collection for $406. At her
hearing, Applicant said she has not made any payments because she is using CRC2 to
confirm  the  correct  amount  of  the  debt.  (Tr.  36;  AE  C)  Her  November  15,  2019  credit
report indicates a bank-originated debt, a balance of $406, and in the comments, it states
that the Applicant disputes the account information. (GE 4 at 2) On January 16, 2020, she
made a $150 payment to the creditor. (AE G at 25) On January 16, 2020, the creditor

She has not contacted the creditor or made any payments. (Tr. 37)

(Tr. 37-38)

for  collection  for  $1,167  and  $99.  Applicant  did  not  make  any  payments  to  the  two
creditors. (Tr. 38) Her November 15, 2019 credit report comments for the debt in ¶ 1.v
that  the  Applicant  disputes  the  account  information.  (GE  4  at  2,  item  2)  She  did  not
recognize the debt in SOR ¶ 1.x; it is not listed on her November 15, 2019 credit report;
and she believed it was deleted from her credit report. (Tr. 38; GE 4; AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.w alleges that Applicant has one medical debt placed for collection for
$746. Applicant utilized CRC2 to establish the amount of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.w. (AE C)
On January 15, 2020, she made a $35 payment to the creditor.
Applicant had a medical debt for $890 placed for collection in September 2019.
(AE G at 22) She was credited with a payment for $267 in August 2019. (Id.) She made
a $26 payment on January 2, 2020, and the current balance is $597. (Id. at 20-22) The
collection  agent  is  not  shown  on  her  November  15,  2019  credit  report,  and  there  is
insufficient evidence to connect this debt to any of the debts alleged on her SOR. (GE 4)
Applicant made a $39 payment to another collection agent on January 15, 2020.
(AE G at 25) The collection agent is not shown on her November 15, 2019 credit report,
and there is insufficient evidence to connect this debt to any of the debts alleged on her
SOR. (GE 4)
On  December  17,  2019,  a  collection  agent  informed  Applicant  that  she  had  a
$3,329 medical debt placed for collection. (AE G at 19) The collection agent is not shown
on her November 15, 2019 credit report or SOR. (GE 4) There is insufficient evidence to
connect this debt to any of the debts alleged on her SOR. (GE 4)
Applicant’s  November 15,  2019  credit  report  indicates  the following  information:
(1) she has a $15,947 debt with a scheduled payment of $498 on a 72-month payment
plan that is current (GE 4 at 2-3); (2) her student loans with the following balances are
current: $8,265; $3,575; $4,827; and $3,869 (GE 4 at 3); (3) some of her student loans
may be duplications (GE 5 at 5);  (4) a vehicle loan with high credit of $18,431 was paid
in September 2017 (GE 4 at 4-5); (5) the following 12 SOR debts are not listed: 1.e, 1.f,
1.g, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, 1.r, 1.w, and 1.x (GE 4); and (6) all of the SOR debts not
listed on her November 15, 2019 credit report except for SOR ¶ 1.f and 1.o are medical
debts.
Applicant employed two credit restoration companies (CRC1 and CRC2) to assist
her in determining which debts on her credit report were valid. (Tr. 35-36; GE 5 at 3-4;
AE G at 3-4) On September 18, 2019, and December 18, 2019, CRC2 listed the accounts
currently disputed and already deleted from her credit report. (SOR response; AE B) It is
noteworthy that CRC2 is disputing some accounts that Applicant indicated at her hearing
were valid, such as her student loan accounts; however, she may be disputing the amount
of  the  debt.  She  was  unfamiliar  with  several  of  the  debts  that  appeared  on  her  credit
report. (Tr. 35-36)
On January 16, 2020, CRC2 wrote:
After an extensive amount of research in assisting [Applicant] with accounts,
we  learn[ed]  there  are  several  accounts  listed  which  are  either  not
belonging, incorrect balance reporting and/or not primary account holder.
There are several accounts that we do not have knowledge of or access to,
as they are not physically reporting on the current reports. We also do not
have any history or knowledge throughout any portion of her enrollment in
our credit education program of any accounts below. The following accounts
have  been  contacted,  [they  either  do  not  exist  or  they  do  not  belong  on
Applicant’s credit report]. (AE G at 4)
CRC2 listed nine debts in the following SOR paragraphs as not substantiated: 1.w
($746); 1.x ($99); 1.o $4,827); 1.f ($1,287); 1.j ($491); 1.k ($486); 1.m $389); 1.n ($375);
and 1.h ($840). (AE G at 4) Applicant recently made a payment to address the debt in
SOR ¶ 1.w.
Applicant  and  her husband  share  expenses.  Her  husband  is employing  training
drivers  for  delivery  trucks.  (Tr.  47)  Applicant’s  budget  provides  the  following  monthly
information:  pay  $3,010;  expenses  $1,062;  rent  $1,780;  food  $300;  gas  $200;  and
miscellaneous items $150. (AE A) Her net remainder is a negative $482; however, her
husband agreed to pay $450 monthly to address the SOR debts and household expenses
and to pay half of the rent once the family debts are paid. (AE G at 6) He also pays for
vehicle loans, utilities, vehicle insurance, and his child support (Tr. 43; AE A; AG G at 6)
Her spouse’s gross monthly income is $3,846; however, he has worked for his current
employer for only about five months. (AE G at 8) She may have miscalculated the amount
of  her  spouse’s  contributions.  Her  budget  shows  monthly  payments  totaling  $313  to
address SOR debts as follows: SOR ¶¶ 1.s and 1.t, student loans ($228); SOR ¶ 1.i, retail
account ($35); and SOR ¶ 1.u, withdrawn ($50). She has allocated about 10 percent of
her net income to address her SOR debts.
Character Evidence
Applicant’s cousin by marriage has known her for 14 years. (Tr. 51) He described
her as honest, reliable, loyal, and trustworthy. (Tr. 51) He believes she will pay her debts
and establish her financial responsibility. (Tr. 53)
