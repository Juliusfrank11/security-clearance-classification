In  his  combined  responses  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted,  with  very  brief
comments, three of the SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR ¶¶
1.a.  through  1.c.).  Applicant’s  admissions  and  his  comments  are  incorporated  herein.
After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the  evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due
consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as engineer with his current employer since August 2017, and previously worked for the
same contractor as a systems administrator from March 2016 until July 2017. A 2001 high
school graduate, he received an associate’s degree in 2013, and he  earned additional
credits from  a  college but  no  other  degree. He  enlisted  in  the  U.S.  Army  in  November
2004, and served on active duty, including two tours in Iraq (August 2005 until December
2005, and December 2007 until December 2008), until he was discharged in March 2013
with a general discharge under honorable conditions. He was granted a secret clearance
in 2016. He was married in 2007, and he has five children, born in 2012, 2013, 2015, and
2017 (twins).
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can  be  found  in  the  following  exhibits:  Item  5  (Combined  Experian,  TransUnion,  and
Equifax Credit Report, dated March 2, 2017); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated May
1,  2019);  Item  4  (Enhanced  Subject  Interview,  dated  June  7,  2018);  and  Item  2
(Applicant’s Answers to SOR, dated November 11, 2019).
Applicant  reported  that  he  was  unemployed  from  March  2013,  when  he  was
discharged from the U.S. Army, until September 2013; and from January 2015, when he
was terminated for tardiness, until April 2015. He attributed his financial problems to only
one factor: he was not earning enough money. (Item 4, at 24)
In his November 2016 SF 86, Applicant denied having any delinquent accounts.
(Item 3 (2016 SF 86), at 43-44) However, when he was interviewed by an investigator
with  the  U.S.  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  on  June  7,  2018,  after  being
confronted by the investigator, he discussed various accounts, but contended that he was
unaware that they were delinquent, or as he characterized them individually, a “negative
account.”  (Item 4,  at  44-47) The  OPM  investigator offered  Applicant  the  opportunity  to
furnish  documentation  regarding  his  delinquent  accounts  that  they  discussed,  but  he
failed to do so during or after the interview. (Item 4, at 20-23)
The SOR alleged seven delinquent accounts totaling approximately $28,082, but
as Department Counsel noted, there was a scrivener’s error to one of the allegations, and
the  actual  amount  should  have  been  $27,362.  The  accounts  can  be  divided  into  two
groups: a. those for which Applicant acknowledged that he had taken no action prior to
the  issuance  of  the  SOR,  but  which  he  intended  to  take  care  of  them  soon,  after  he
completes resolving the smaller accounts; and b. those for which  Applicant contended
that as of “today,” the account had been settled.
In the first group, there are three delinquent accounts, set forth as follows: SOR ¶
1.a. is an automobile loan with an unpaid balance of $14,600 that was placed for collection
and charged off in February 2016. (Item 5, at 6; Item 6, at 2; Item 4, at 23; Item 2). SOR
¶ 1.b. is a personal loan with a past-due and unpaid balance of $4,252 that was placed
for collection and charged off in November 2013, but as of April 2019, the unpaid balance
had increased to $11,173. (Item 5, at 5; Item 6, at 2; Item 4, at 23; Item 2) SOR ¶ 1.c., as
informally amended, is a personal loan with an unpaid balance of $4,200 that was placed
for collection in November 2013. (Item 5, at 13; Item 6, at 2; Item 4, at 21; Item 2)
In the second group, there are four delinquent accounts which Applicant contended
he  had  resolved.  They  are  set  forth  as  follows:  SOR  ¶  1.d.  is  an  unspecified  type  of
account with an unpaid balance of $306 that was placed for collection and charged off in
June 2014. (Item 5, at 7; Item 4, at 2); SOR ¶ 1.e. is a credit-card account with an unpaid
balance of $1,178 that was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser. (Item 5, at
6; Item 4, at 22-23) SOR ¶ 1.f. is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $1,861
that was placed for collection in February 2015. (Item 5, at 13; Item 4, at 20) SOR ¶ 1.g.
is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $965 that was placed for collection in
February 2016. (Item 5, at 13; Item 4, at 20)
Other than Applicant’s unverified contentions regarding his efforts to resolve the
last  four  delinquent  accounts,  there  is  no  documentary  evidence,  such  as  repayment
plans, cancelled checks, bank account registers, receipts from creditors, or other material
correspondence between him and his creditors to support his position. In December 2019,
Department  Counsel  noted  in  the  FORM  that  Applicant  had  not  provided  any
documentation to support his contentions in his Answer to the SOR. Despite that notice,
Applicant  failed  to  furnish  any  material  documentation.  In  the  absence  of  such
documentation, I conclude that Applicant’s delinquent accounts have not yet entered the
process of being resolved.
It is not known what Applicant’s current financial resources may be because he did
not report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder
that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a
budget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of additional financial
information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position
financially than he had been.
