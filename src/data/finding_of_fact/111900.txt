In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  70-year-old  helicopter-modification  manager  employed  by  federal
contractors since September 2009. He holds a top secret clearance.
Applicant served in the U.S. Marine Corps from May 1972 to February 2004 and
retired as a lieutenant colonel. He married in November 1969, divorced in October 1972,
and  has  been  married  since  June  1973.  He  has  four  adult  children.  After  Applicant’s
retirement from the Marine Corps, he worked in law enforcement positions, and he was
a  deputy  sheriff  in  the  city  where  he  resided  until  he  retired  from  that  position  in  June
2019. (Tr. 25; AX B.)
In June 2011, Applicant’s son was seriously injured in an almost-fatal automobile
accident. (Tr. 27.). In August 2011, Applicant’s home was damaged by a hurricane. In
spite of the hurricane damage and the emotional impact of their son’s injuries, he and his
wife timely filed their tax returns for 2011 and 2012. In November 2016, Applicant’s home
was damaged by another hurricane. He testified that most of the records he needed to
file his tax returns were lost during this hurricane. He and his wife moved their remaining
records  to  another  location,  where  more  records  were  lost  during  a  hurricane  in
September 2018. They did not file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013
through 2018. Applicant testified that he and his wife failed to file tax returns  for those
years because, “We were building things, things were going on in our life, and we were
just getting overwhelmed and did not do it.” (Tr. 51-53.)
For several years, Applicant’s wife worked as a real estate agent. She worked as
an independent contractor, and no taxes were withheld from her income. She did not file
quarterly  returns  or  pay  estimated  taxes  on  her  income.  (Tr.  35.)  Until  2012,  the  tax
withholdings from Applicant’s income were sufficient to pay the taxes due on their joint
income.  In  2012,  Applicant’s  wife  started  a  team  of  realtors,  and  she  began  to  earn
commissions on the sales of her team members. Applicant testified that he and his wife
owed significant federal taxes for 2012, although he could not recall the amount. They
entered  into  payment  plans  providing  for  payments  of  $400  per  month  to  the  IRS  and
$215  per  month  to  the  state  tax  authority,  both  by  direct  debit.  (Attachments  to  SOR
Answer.)
When Applicant submitted his SCA in June 2017, he disclosed that he had not filed
his federal tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016, because his home was flooded during
a hurricane and his financial records were destroyed. In June 2018, he was interviewed
by a security investigator and he again disclosed his failures to file tax returns, citing the
flood damage and destruction of his financial records.
In July 2019, DOHA sent Applicant tax interrogatories. He responded on August
7, 2019, and stated that he owed $23,000 in delinquent taxes for tax year 2014. He also
disclosed that he had not filed federal income tax returns for 2015 through 2018 and had
not filed state tax returns for 2014 through 2018.
On August 6, 2019, the day before Applicant responded to the tax interrogatories,
he and his wife hired a tax attorney, who is also a certified public accountant, to prepare
their federal and state income tax returns for 2013 through 2018 and to represent them
with the IRS and the state tax authorities regarding their tax liabilities for those years. As
of the date of Applicant’s answer to the SOR, his tax attorney had filed his federal and
state income tax returns for 2013 and 2014. (Attachments to SOR Answer.) As of the date
of the hearing, his tax attorney had filed all state and federal tax returns through 2018,
but the IRS was still computing Applicant’s tax debt for 2013 through 2018, and he had
not made any payments for those years. However, in August 2020, he made payments
to the IRS and state tax authorities of estimated income taxes for tax year 2020, and he
increased  the  withholding  of  federal  income  taxes  from  his  retired  pay.  (AX  D.)  At  the
hearing, Applicant testified that he estimated his federal tax debt to be about $150,000
and his state tax debt to be between $30,000 and $35,000 (Tr. 59-60.).
Applicant  and  his  wife  purchased  their  primary  home  in  2004  and  have  about
$200,000 in equity. (Tr. 41.) They have owned another home since 1991, in which they
have equity of about $80,000 (Tr. 41.) Applicant owns a 2003 pickup truck which is fully
paid for. His wife purchased a new car in 2019 for about $39,000, on which the monthly
payments are about $609. He also owns a 2011 motorcycle that he purchased in 2015
for $10,500, on which the payments are $235 per month. (Tr. 44.) He has about $4,000
in savings and investments (Tr. 45.)
Applicant  estimated  that  for  the  seven  years  since  2013,  his  wife’s  income  has
fluctuated from about $60,000 to $110,000. He testified that for every tax year since 2012,
he and his wife had joint income above $200,000. (Tr. 38.) He estimated that their net
monthly remainder each month is between about $8,000 and $10,000. (Tr. 65.)
