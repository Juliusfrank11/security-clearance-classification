In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  both  allegations,  with  explanations.  His
admissions  are  adopted  as  a  finding  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 61-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He began working at
his  present  job  in  December  2017.  Except  for  two  months  of  unemployment  from
October to December 2017, Applicant has worked for a federal contractor since 1998.
He  has  held  a  security  clearance  for  over  25  years  without  incident.  He  holds  a
bachelor’s degree. He has been married for 30 years and has one adult son. (Tr. 21, 23,
26-27, 34; GE 1)
The SOR alleged one charged-off and one collection debt (a home improvement
loan  and  a  personal  loan  to  pay  for  their  son’s  private  secondary  education)  totaling
approximately  $81,000.  The  debts  are  established  by  a  credit  report  from  November
February 2018, Applicant’s SOR admissions; and his hearing testimony. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a –
1.o). (Tr. 24, 36-39, 55; GE 2)
In  2005,  Applicant  and  his  wife  purchased  a  family  home  for  approximately
$450,000.  They  financed  this  purchase  with  two  loans  secured  by  a  primary  and  a
secondary  mortgage.  Applicant  earned  approximately  $120,000  yearly  at  the  time  and
his  wife  earned  approximately  $75,000  yearly.  Their  monthly  payments  on  both
mortgages was approximately $2,200 (the two mortgages were held by the same bank).
They made their monthly mortgage payments until about 2010. (Tr. 34-35, 40-41, 51-53,
55)
In 2005, Applicant took out a home improvement loan of approximately $45,000
(SOR ¶ 1.a). This loan was apparently not secured by his residence. Applicant incurred
this  loan  to  add  a  swimming  pool  to  his  property  along  with  ancillary  landscaping.
Applicant  estimated  his  monthly  payments  on  this  debt  were  $400.  In  2006  or  2007,
Applicant  obtained  another  non-secured  personal  loan  to  fund  his  child’s  private
secondary  education  in  the  amount  of  approximately  $37,000  (SOR  ¶  1.b).  Applicant
incurred  this  loan  because  his  child  was  associating  with  an  undesirable  crowd  at  his
public  school  causing  disciplinary  and  legal  concerns.  Applicant  felt  that  sending  his
child to a private school away from his son’s current associates would be in his child’s
best  interests.  He  funded  this  education  with  the  aforementioned  loan.  Applicant  does
not  recall  the  amount  of  his  monthly  payments  on  this  loan,  but  believes  they  were
under $1,000. Applicant claims that he made his monthly payments on both loans until
approximately 2009, when his wife became ill and stopped working, thus reducing their
overall  income.  The  date  of  last  action  on  the  home-improvement  loan  was  in  March
2012  when  it  was  in  a  “collection”  status.  The  education  loan  was  charged  off  in  April
2012. Applicant did not receive IRS 1099-C, cancellation of debt notices, for either loan.
(Tr. 36, 38-40, 42, 51-52, 5; GE 2)
Applicant’s  wife  became  ill  in  2009,  incurred  additional  medical  treatment
thereafter,  and  was  unable  to  return  to  work.  She  has  not  applied  for  social  security
disability  payments.  As  a  result  of  this  income  loss,  Applicant’s  residence  was
foreclosed in approximately 2010, when he stopped making his monthly payments upon
the advice of his lender. This advice was predicated on allowing Applicant to qualify for
a mortgage modification. However, a modification never occurred and Applicant lost the
property through foreclosure. Between 2010 and 2012, Applicant claims that he sought
to negotiate with the creditor holding the two SOR debts. He documented sending the
creditor a letter in April 2012 requesting to negotiate lower payments on the two loans.
He  did  not  get  a  reply  and  had  no  further  communications  with  this  lender  until  after
October  2019,  when  he  received  the  SOR.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  stopped  paying
on  the  two  loans  in  2012  because  he  became  frustrated  that  the  lender  would  not
negotiate with him. Neither of the loans appear on his current credit report. (Tr. 38, 40-
46, 52-53, 55-56; AE G-H)
Applicant provided a budget, which showed that he has approximately a $1,000
monthly  remainder  after  paying  his  regular  monthly  expenses.  He  testified  that  in
November  2019,  he  obtained  a  $34,000  loan  to  pay  off  several  high  interest  credit
cards. His monthly payments on this new loan is $893. His credit report showed that he
had  made  two payments  as of  February  2020.  He  has  a retirement  account  valued at
approximately $100,000. His current income is approximately $162,000 annually and he
receives a $1,800 monthly pension payment from an earlier job. (Tr. 46-47, 57-58, 62;
GE 3; AE H-I)
Applicant was unable to provide copies of his recent job performance appraisals
because  they  included  proprietary  information  his  company  did  not  want  made  public.
He provided copies of awards and certifications he has earned over his career. His work
has secured five patents for his employers. He also provided six letters from current and
former  colleagues  and  personal  friends  who  noted  his  trustworthiness,  honesty,  and
other admirable character traits. Two colleagues recommended that Applicant retain his
security clearance. (Tr. 33; AE B-F, J)
