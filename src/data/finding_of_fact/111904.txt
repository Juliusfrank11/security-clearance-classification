The  SOR  alleges  15  defaulted  federal  student  loans  totaling  about  $195,000;  a
defaulted  $16,721  private  student  loan;  and  a  charged-off  $2,384  credit  card  account.
Applicant admitted owing all of the student loans and the credit card debt.
Applicant paid $253 toward his federal student loans in February 2019. The IRS
withheld $3,413 from his income tax refund the same month and applied it to his student
loans. He entered into a loan rehabilitation agreement for his 15 federal student loans in
March 2019. The balance of the loans at that time was $237,123. The monthly payment
was  $253.  He  made  all  of  the  required  monthly  payments  through  October  2019,  and
his loans were considered rehabilitated and in good standing. (Tr. at 25-28; Applicant’s
response to SOR; AE A, B, G, J)
In  December  2019,  Applicant  was  approved  for  a  Revised  Pay  As  You  Earn
Repayment  Plan  (REPAYE  Plan)1  for  his  rehabilitated  federal  student  loans.  His
monthly payment will be based on his income. His current monthly payment is $72, but
will be revised in March 2020. He expects the payments to be about $300 per month. If
he makes the required payments for 25 years, any remaining balance will be forgiven.
The  balance  of  the  15  loans  was  about  $204,200.  The  difference  from  the  $237,123
figure appears to be from payments and the elimination of some fees and penalties after
the loans were rehabilitated. (Tr. at 25-28; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE C)
Applicant  paid  $1,913  in  January  2020  as  settlement  in  full  for  the  $2,384
charged-off credit card account. His grandfather managed and paid the $16,721 private
student loan until he passed away in 2015. Applicant  settled the loan  in January 2020
for $6,643, which will be paid by a $277 payment, followed by 23 monthly payments of
$276. (Tr. at 30-39, 42-47; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE D, G, H, I)
Applicant  admitted  that  he  was  somewhat  cavalier  about  his  student  loans.  He
realizes that he could have started the process years ago, but he was unfamiliar with his
options. He received financial counseling through his employer. He credibly testified that

he intends to continue to pay his student loans. He will always be able to pay his federal
student loans because the payments are based on his income. He knows that the loans
have to be paid, and that failure to do so could adversely affect his security clearance
and  his  job.  His  finances  are  otherwise  in  order.  (Tr.  at  24-29,  52-56,  60-62,  70-72;
