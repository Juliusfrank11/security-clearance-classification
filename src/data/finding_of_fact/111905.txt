Applicant  is a  27-year-old  single  man.  He has a high school education and has
earned some college credits. For the past eight years, he has been working for a defense
contractor as a system administrator. (Tr. 20)
Over the years, Applicant has incurred approximately $45,000 of delinquent debt, as
alleged in the SOR. The delinquency alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.a, totaling $24,506,
constitutes the balance of a car note that was due in 2017 after Applicant was in a car
accident.  Although  Applicant  had  gap  insurance,  the  insurance  company  refused  to
reimburse  him,  contending  that  he  was  contributorily  negligent.  (Tr.  22)  In  July  2020,
Applicant contacted the creditor who agreed to settle the account for $5,000. (AE A at 2)
He made his first payment, totaling $900, the day he negotiated the settlement. (AE A at 1)
On  August  7,  2020,  he  made  a  payment  of  $1,100.  (AE  J)  The  current  balance  is
approximately $3,000.
The delinquency alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.b is a delinquent car note, totaling
$14,459. This stems from another car accident. As in subparagraph 1.a, the delinquency
constitutes the balance due on a car that Applicant totaled in an accident. (Tr. 23) Applicant
possessed  gap  insurance,  which  did  not  cover  the  claim.  Applicant  has  not  made  any
payments towards the satisfaction of this delinquency. (Tr. 40) He has been in contact with
agents of the loan company, but has been informed that the negotiation process will take
longer because of COVID-related delays. (Tr. 40)
SOR subparagraph 1.c is a credit card account totaling $5,377.  Applicant settled
this  account  for  $1,344,  and  satisfied  it  on  June  23,  2020.  (AE  B)  Subparagraph  1.d,
totaling $1,165 is a credit account that Applicant used to purchase furniture in 2014. In
June 2020, he settled and paid the account for $630. (AE C)
Subparagraphs 1.e and 1.f allege delinquencies collectively totaling $468. Applicant

4)  Applicant cosigned this account for a cousin. Applicant satisfied this debt.   (Tr. 26-27)
SOR subparagraph 1.h, totaling $1,091, is a delinquency stemming from a cable
television box that Applicant forgot to return after he moved. He satisfied this debt in its
entirety in July 2020. (AE D)
The debt alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.i is a delinquent car loan totaling $10,918.
(AE E) Applicant cosigned this loan for his roommate who defaulted, leading the creditor to
obtain  a  judgment  against  both  Applicant  and  his  roommate  in  July  2018.  Applicant’s
roommate has been paying this debt through a garnishment since August 2020. (AE I; Tr.
62)
When Applicant first began working as a systems administrator eight years ago, he
earned $34,000. (Tr. 29) As the only member of his extended family with a steady job, he
would sometimes overextend himself financially to help relatives pay bills. (Tr. 29-30)  In
addition, some of his debt includes money he used to finance the funerals of two family
members who passed away between 2013 and 2014. (Tr. 24, 29)
Since 2015, Applicant’s annual salary has increased by $40,000. (Tr. 62 – 63) He
uses a budgeting app to track his finances. (Tr. 66) He has $2,000 of monthly discretionary
income that he applies to his delinquencies, and he has $500 in savings. (Tr. 64)
Applicant completed a security clearance application in November 2018. He did not
list the July 2018 judgment, as required in response to Section 26. Applicant contends that
the  omission  was  unintentional,  as  he  did  not  know  about  this  judgment  until  after  he
completed the security clearance application. (Tr. 60)  Applicant and the primary borrower
on the loan were roommates when the judgment was filed. (Tr. 61) The initial pleading lists
both gentlemen as codefendants. (GE 4) The court records indicate that the court issued
two summons in April 2018 and that service was executed on two individuals on June 20,
2018. (GE 4 at 3)
