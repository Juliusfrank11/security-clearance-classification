The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of October 4, 2019, Applicant owed two
student-loan debts of $11,054 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and $7,329 (SOR ¶ 1.c) in collection; a $9,546
charged-off automobile loan (SOR ¶ 1.b); two mobile-phone debts of $2,091 (SOR ¶ 1.d)
and $1,255 (SOR ¶ 1.u); four delinquent credit-card debts of $603 (SOR ¶ 1.e), $377 (SOR
¶ 1.f); $345 (SOR ¶ 1.g), and $517 (SOR ¶ 1.t); a $438 satellite-television debt in collection
(SOR ¶ 1.h); and 11 medical debts in collection totaling $2,804 (SOR ¶¶ 1.i-1.s). (Item 1.)
When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted the debts and provided documentation of
some payments toward his debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.h, 1.o, and 1.u, and to the collection
agency  that  he  asserted  holds  his  medical  bills  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.i  to  1.p  and  1.q.  He  also
indicated that he had established a repayment arrangement for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.t. (Item
2.)
After considering Items 1 through 7, which includes Applicant’s response to the SOR
(Item 2), and Applicant’s response to the FORM (AE A), I make the following findings of
fact:
Applicant  is  59  years  old  and  a  high  school  graduate  who  attended  a  technical
college from December 2010 to February 2011. He served in the U.S. military from July
1985  to  February  1987  when  he  was  given  a  general  discharge  for  marijuana  use.
Applicant has been married to his current spouse September 2009. He was married to his
first wife from August 1992 to July 2008. He has a son age 41, two daughters ages 28 and
20, and a stepchild age 17. (Item 3.)
No information was provided about Applicant’s employment for approximately the
first  20  years  after  his  military  discharge.  Between  August  2006  and  March  2018,  he
worked  primarily  as  a  telecommunications  technician  or  engineer  for  a  succession  of
employers outside of the defense industry. He was unemployed from December 2010 to
February 2011, while attending a technical college, and most recently from November 2017
to January 2018. Since March 2018, Applicant has been employed as a technician for a
defense contractor in support of the U.S. military. (Item 3.)
Applicant built a new home for his family into which they moved in December 2015.
He obtained a 30-year mortgage loan for $327,635. At the time, he was earning $95,000 in
annual salary. In October 2016, he was laid off. He was given six weeks notice and a
severance package. He found another job almost immediately, but at loss of $30,000 in
annual salary from his previous job. He fell behind 30 days on his mortgage loan payments
in May 2017, but brought the loan current in July 2017. However, Applicant was laid off in
November 2017 when his then employer lost the contract, and he was unemployed until
January  2018.  He  collected  unemployment  compensation,  but  could  not  maintain  the
payments on his mortgage. He contacted his mortgage lender and was told that he could
not obtain a loan re-modification until his loan was 120 days past due. As of May 2018, his
account was $13,444 past due on a balance of $327,427. In July 2018, he successfully
modified his loan. In October 2018, he began repaying his loan under a modified payment
agreement  where  the  delinquency  was  added  to  the  end  of  his  loan  and  his  monthly
payments were lowered from $2,094 to $1,668. He made his loan payments on time until
November  2019,  when  he  missed  his  payment.  As  of  December  2019,  his  modified
mortgage was $1,997 past due. (Items 2-7.) In rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant admitted
that he was 15 days behind on his mortgage, but he borrowed $827 from his 401k to catch
up  on  his  loan.  Available  loan  documentation  shows  that  he  made  his  January  2020
payment late. His loan has a principal balance of $229,629. His home has a taxable value
of $383,065, so he has considerable equity in his residence. (AE A.)
Applicant began working for his defense-contractor employer in March 2018, earning
approximately $63,000 a year. (Item 4.) In application for initial DOD clearance eligibility,
Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions  (SF  86)  on  April  3,  2018.  In  response  to  financial  record  inquiries,  Applicant
indicated  that  he  was  currently  seeking  assistance  from  a  credit-counseling  service  or
similar resource to resolve financial difficulties in that he had entered into a program to
lower  his  interest  and  payments  on  debts  that  he  did  not  specify.  He  responded
affirmatively to questions concerning any delinquency involving routine accounts, and he
listed  seven  debts:  (1)  a  medical  bill  of  $1,959  from  May  2013  that  he  was  reportedly
repaying at $25 monthly; (2) a medical bill of $726 from April 2016 that he was repaying at
$20  monthly  (SOR  ¶  1.o);  (3)  a  school  loan  of  $2,005  in  a  nine-month  rehabilitation
program; (4) a $517 credit-card debt in collection that he was repaying at $35 per month
(SOR ¶ 1.t); (5) a $9,581 car-loan debt for a vehicle “totaled out” in an accident (SOR ¶ 1.b)
that he was reportedly repaying at $20 a month; (6) a $590 credit-card debt from June 2017
(SOR ¶ 1.g); and a mortgage loan past due for $9,294 (not alleged). Applicant stated that
he fell behind on his home loan due to a job loss in November 2017 [sic] and that he had
successfully modified the loan to have the delinquency added to the end of a new loan with
a lower monthly repayment. (Item 3.)
Available  credit  reports  of  May  23,  2018  (Item  5),  May  15,  2019  (Item  6),  and
December 19, 2019 (Item 7), list several delinquencies on Applicant’s credit record. Details
about the debts in the SOR and repayment arrangements follow.
Student loans in collection for $11,054 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and $7,329 (SOR ¶ 1.c)
Applicant  obtained  two  federal  student  loans  in  January  2011,  for  $3,500  (not
alleged in SOR) to be repaid at $19 per month, and for $5,415 (SOR ¶ 1.c), to be repaid at
$49 per month. Applicant obtained another federal student loan, for $8,500 in September
2011, with required repayment at $72 per month. (Items 2, 5-7.) He defaulted on the three
loans in July 2017, and his debts were sold or transferred in March 2018. (Item 5.) He
made $25 payments in April 2018 and May 2018, and a $20 payment in July 2018. He
consolidated his three student loans, which were in collection. On October 5, 2018, he
entered into an arrangement to make $75 monthly payments toward his student loans. He
made $75 payments in November 2018 and December 2018. On February 7, 2019, during
his PSI, Applicant explained that he made $75 payments in November 2018 and December
2018, but that the company holding his loans made an error in his paperwork. He stated
that he was awaiting a new loan agreement so that he could resume payments toward a
consolidated balance of $22,081. (Item 4.)
Available documentation shows that he made a payment of $35 on February 16,
2019. As of February 19, 2019, his student loans had past-due balances of $4,425 (not
alleged in SOR), $12,995 (SOR ¶ 1.a), and $8,616 (SOR ¶ 1.c), and were included in an
income-based repayment plan requiring monthly payments of $5 to start on February 20,
2019. Applicant began making $10 monthly payments ($5 extra each month) toward his
student-loan debts. (Item 2.) As of October 30, 2019, the aggregate balance of his three
outstanding student loans was $22,824. Payments of $10 monthly were being automatically
debited from his bank account. As of November 2019, his student loans were current with
respective balances of $11,473 (SOR ¶ 1.a), $7,607 (SOR ¶ 1.c), and $3,852 (not alleged
in SOR). (Item 2.) He paid $23 toward his student loans in December 2019. As of March
2020,  his  student  loans were  in  administrative forbearance with  a balance  of  $23,179.
Applicant explained in response to the FORM that he completed a rehabilitation program to
lower his monthly payment from $281 to $203 with his first payment due on March 20,
2020. (AE A.)
Auto loan charge-off for $9,546 (SOR ¶ 1.b)
In April 2016, Applicant and his spouse obtained a joint automobile loan for $24,340,
requiring repayment at $443 per month. (Items 5-7.) The dealer offered no gap insurance.
When his spouse had an accident in 2017, their insurance company decided “to total out
the car,” leaving them owing a $9,500 debt. Applicant states that the creditor would not
finance  the  amount  in  a  new  vehicle  and  instead  gave  them  the  options of  paying the
balance in two or three installment payments, which they could not afford. Applicant made
no payments after May 2017, and his account was charged off for $9,581. (Items 2, 4.) The
debt was placed for collection in April 2018 with $9,561 owed. During his February 2019
PSI, Applicant stated that he had been making $25 monthly payments every couple of
months. On February 8, 2019, Applicant told the OPM investigator that he had arranged to
make  automatic  payments  of  $20  monthly  toward  this  loan  deficiency.  He  provided
documentation of a $20 payment pending as of March 1, 2019. (Item 4.) As of April 2019,
the loan balance was past due for $9,546. (Items 5-7.) Applicant presented documentation
of $5 monthly payments toward the debt from May 2019 through November 2019. (Item 2.)
His reported balance was $9,511 as of November 30, 2019. (Item 7.) Effective February 28,
2020, he raised his monthly payment from $5 to $25. (AE A.)
Mobile phone debt in collection for $2,091 (SOR ¶ 1.d)
As of May 2018, a collection entity was reporting a past-due balance of $2,106 from
December 2017 in collection. (Item 5.)  During his February 2019 PSI, Applicant denied
knowing about the debt and indicated that he would establish repayment arrangements if
the debt was valid. He subsequently provided the OPM investigator with documentation
showing that he arranged to make $20 monthly payments to start on March 1, 2019. (Item
4.) Applicant now asserts that the creditor would only accept a one-time payment, but he
began repaying the debt at $5 per month starting May 1, 2019. Those payments were
accepted by the creditor, who was reporting a $2,056 balance as of December 5, 2019.
(Items 2, 7.) Effective February 28, 2020, Applicant raised his monthly payment from $5 to
$15. (AE A.)
Credit-card debt in collection for $603 (SOR ¶ 1.e)
A credit-card account was charged off and sold in January 2017 to a collection entity
with $603 owed. As of February 2019, Applicant mistakenly believed that the debt was held
by the same entity managing his accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g. (Item 4.) As of May 2019,
the debt was unpaid. (Items 5-7.) Applicant arranged to repay the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e at
$19.45 per month from October 28, 2019, through April 28, 2022. (Item 2.) As of December
2019, Applicant’s credit report was showing a debt balance of $564 after his November
2019 payment. (Item 7.)
Collection debt for $377 (SOR ¶ 1.f, same debt in SOR ¶ 1.t)
In April 2017, a credit-card collection debt of $517 was assigned for collection with
the entity in SOR ¶ 1.t. (Items 5-7.) As of May 2018, the account had a past-due balance of
$377. (Item 5.) During his February 2019 PSI, Applicant related that, about four or five
years  prior,  he  and  his  spouse  had  several  department  store  credit  cards  that  were
charging high interest rates, so they contracted with a debt management company, initially
to negotiate for lower interest rates on their credit balances. In return for $130 a month, the
company initially managed five accounts. Applicant added accounts to the plan as needed.
(Item  4.)  As  of  his  response  to  the  SOR,  the  debts  in  SOR ¶¶  1.f  and  1.g  were  being
managed by the company. Payment records show Applicant made lower payments to the
debt management company of $115 in February 2019 and April 2019, and increased his
payments to $130 in March 2019 and from May 2019 through October 2019. (Items 2, 4.)
As of October 2019, the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f had a  balance of $273. After a payment in
November 2019, his balance was $251. (Items 2, 6-7.)
Credit-card debt in collection for $345 (SOR ¶ 1.g)
A charge card opened with a retailer in December 2009 was charged off for $590
due to no payment since March 2017. As of April 2018, the debt was in collection. As of
April 2019, the account had a $345 past-due balance. (Items 5-6.)The debt was being
managed by the debt management company with a $234 balance as of October 2019. On
October 24, 2019, he made a $22.85 payment directly to the collection agency for the debt.
After a $40 payment in November 2019, his debt balance was $150. (Items 2, 7.)
Satellite television debt in collection for $438 (SOR 1.h)
In June 2017, a satellite television service provider placed a $438 debt for collection.
In January 2018, the debt was acquired by the collection entity in SOR ¶ 1.h. As of May
2018, the debt was still outstanding. (Item 5.)  When confronted about the debt during his
February  2019  PSI,  Applicant  explained  that  he  had  paid  the  final  bill,  but  the  dish
equipment was still on the roof of his home. He explained that he would contact the creditor
to return the dish and set up a repayment plan. (Item 4.) In response to the SOR, Applicant
explained that he was not satisfied with the service, but the provider would not let him out of
the two-year contract. Between May 1, 2019, and November 1, 2019, Applicant made $5
monthly payments toward the debt. His payments were accepted by the creditor. (Item 2.)
Effective February 28, 2020, he raised his monthly payment from $5 to $15. (AE A.)
Medical collection debt for $686 (SOR ¶ 1.o)
A medical debt of $726 from April 2016 was placed for collection. As of May 2018,
the  balance  was  $686.  (Item  5.)  Applicant  began repaying the  debt  at  $25  a month  in
approximately February 2019. (Item 4.) As of October 22, 2019, the balance was $461
because he made nine months of payments at $25 each. (Item 2.)
Medical collection debts for $43 (SOR ¶ 1.i); $100 (SOR ¶ 1.j); $180 (SOR ¶ 1.k); $199
(SOR ¶ 1.l); $1,133 (SOR ¶ 1.m); $229 (SOR ¶ 1.n); $49 (SOR ¶ 1.p); $35 (SOR ¶ 1.q);
$77 (SOR ¶ 1.r); and $73 (SOR ¶ 1.s)
As of May 2018, Applicant owed medical collection debts of $43 from September
2015; $100 from December 2013; $180 of a $270 debt from December 2012; $199 from
December 2012; $1,133 from August 2014; $229 from August 2014; $49 from October
2016; $35 from October 2016; $77 from August 2014; and $73 from December 2013. (Item
5.) During his February 7, 2019 PSI, Applicant stated that he consolidated the bills in 2018,
and was assigned an account manager in January or February 2019, who established a
plan requiring him to make $25 to $35 monthly payments toward these debts. (Item 4.) On
February  8,  2019,  Applicant  told  the  OPM  investigator  that  he  had  arranged  to  make
automatic payments of $20 monthly toward these medical debts, which were from multiple
knee surgeries. (Item 4.) In response to the FORM, Applicant provided a payment record
showing automatic payments of $20 on March 1, 2019, and $10 monthly between April 1,
2019, and November 1, 2019, to the collection entity reportedly now holding the debt. (Item
2.) None of those debts were on his credit record with Equifax as of December 2019 (Item
7), even though they have not been fully satisfied. He is continuing to make $10 monthly
payments toward the medical debts. (AE A.)
Wireless telephone debt for collection for $1,255 (SOR ¶ 1.u)
In August 2017, a wireless services provider placed a $1,255 debt for collection. As
of  May  2018,  the  debt  had  not  been  paid.  (Item  5.)  During  his  February  7,  2019  PSI,
Applicant said the debt was for his spouse’s phone, although he was also on the account,
and that his spouse cancelled the service prematurely. He denied knowing that the debt
was in collections. (Item 4.) On February 8, 2019, Applicant told the OPM investigator that
he had arranged to make automatic payments of $20 monthly toward this loan deficiency.
(Item 4.) In response to the SOR, Applicant indicated that the vendor “would not let [them]
out  of  the  unknowing  contract  we  had  with  them.”  He  made  a  $20  payment  that  was
processed  by the creditor on March 1, 2019, and made $5 monthly payments through
January  2020.  (Item  2.)  Effective  February  28,  2020,  Applicant  raised  his  monthly
payments to $15. (AE A.)
As of May 2018, Applicant was making timely payments on a closed credit-card
account with a $1,113 balance; on open credit-card accounts with balances of $58, $322,
and $1,371; on a joint vehicle loan obtained for $16,726 in May 2017 with a current balance
of $16,115; and on a home-furnishings debt with a $2,570 balance. (Item 5.)
During his February 7, 2019 PSI, Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to the
decline  in  household  income  when  he  lost  his  job  in  October  2016  and  then  his
unemployment  between  November  2017  and  January  2018.  He  indicated  that  he  was
“trying to pay creditors here and there and playing catchup on past-due bills.” His spouse
works only occasionally as a photographer. (Item 4.) He provided no information about her
income.
In its December 2019 FORM, the Government acknowledged Applicant’s payments
on his debts but found them to be “extremely low.” The Government also expressed some
concern because he was delinquent on his mortgage loan and car loan payments for the
vehicle purchased in May 2017. As of December 2019, Applicant was $1,997 past due on
his mortgage loan; $1,027 past due on the car loan obtained in May 2017; and $225 past
due on a home-furnishings account (balance $2,862) that had been current for over two
years until October 2019. In response to the Government’s concerns, Applicant raised his
monthly payments on some of his delinquencies effective February 28, 2020, to “the most
[he] can pay to fit [his] budget.” Concerning his home loan, he indicated that he brought it
current  with  the  funds  borrowed  from  his  retirement  account,  although  the  loan
documentation shows that he requested the withdrawal on February 7, 2020, and the funds
had not been disbursed as of February 8, 2020. He indicated that he was no longer behind
on his car loan because he refinanced his loan to lower his monthly payment to $251.
Applicant made car payments of $682 in September 2019, $1,745 on December 23, 2019,
and $400 on December 30, 2019. A $1,745 payment on December 24, 2019, was returned,
and he paid nothing in October or November 2019. Account information for the vehicle loan
shows that, as of February 6, 2020, $758 was due on a loan balance of $12,444. (AE A.)
Applicant  did  not  explain  why  he  fell  behind  on  his  mortgage  and  car  loans.  He  also
provided no specifics  about  his  finances, including his household budget, which would
indicate he has the means to make his student-loan payment initially due on March 20,
2020.
Applicant  has  been  a  lead  communications  technician  on  a  military  base  for
approximately two years. He supports all communications on the base, which includes
telephone and fiber optic infrastructure. He works 50 to 55 hours most weeks, and is on
call. He does not get paid for the on-call time. He indicates that he put two children through
college  and  is  “working  on  the  next,”  and  that  it  is  going  to  take  some  time  for  him  to
resolve his delinquent debts. (AE A.) Applicant submitted no evidence about the extent to
which he covered college costs for his children.
