Applicant is 33 years old and single.  She has a bachelor’s of science degree in
electrical  engineering.    She  holds  the  positon  of  systems  engineer  for  a  defense
contractor.  She seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment
in the defense industry.
The  SOR  alleges
that  Applicant  has  10  delinquent  accounts
totaling
approximately  $60,000.    Her  student  loan  debt  totals  approximately  $50,233.39  of  the
total.  The remaining debt is medical debt.  In her Answer, Applicant admits each of the
allegations  and  provides  explanations.    Credit  reports  of  the  Applicant  dated  October
19,  2018;  May  10,  2019;  January  23,  2020;  and  March  4,  2020,  reflect  that  each  of
these debts was at one point owing.  (Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5, and 6.)
Applicant is  a  native-born  American  citizen  who  did  not  come  from  a  financially
privileged  background.    Her  parents  are  Haitian  immigrants  who  became  naturalized
citizens  of  the  United  States,  wanting  better  opportunities  for  themselves  and  their
children.    Applicant  was  taught  to  work  hard,  obtain  her  education,  and  make  her
parents  proud, by  creating  a  better life  for herself.   Applicant did  just  that.    She  was  a
high  achiever and an  excellent  student.    She  did  exceptionally  well in high  school  and
was  admitted  to  a  prestigious  out-of-state  university.    Her  parents  could  not  afford  to
pay  for  her  college  education  and  so  she  obtained  student loans  to  attend.    Applicant
always had every intent to pay back her student loans.
From 2004 to 2007, Applicant completed three and a half years at this university,
and  did  well,  before  a  tragic  event.    A  shooting  occurred  on  campus  which  killed  20
people.  For her safety, Applicant moved back home and transferred to a local in-state
university  to  finish  her  degree.    This  disruption  in  her  education  caused  even  more
expenses.    When  Applicant  transferred  to  the  local  in-state  university,  she  initially
started school on a full-time basis, but soon had to go part time, while working odd jobs,
in order to pay for her living expenses and tuition.  She always lived frugally.  Applicant
graduated  from  this  university  in  May  2014,  and  had  a  challenging  time  obtaining
employment.    Two  years  before  she  graduated,  in  2012 or  2013,  some  of  her  student
loans became due, and Applicant had no ability to pay them.  She tried to defer them,
but because they were private loans they could not be deferred beyond five years.  She
tried to work out a payment plan, but the payments the creditors offered were more than
she  could  afford  to  pay.    Applicant  further  testified  that  when  she  turned  26,  she  no
longer had medical benefits as a student, and the two medical bills she incurred on the
SOR became owing and delinquent because she did not have the money to pay them.
It was not until August 2018, that Applicant obtained a full time job when she was
hired by her current employer.  At that time, she contacted her creditors, and found out
that her debts were in a charged-off or default status.  They offered her settlements, but
they were large sums that she did not have.  Applicant started saving her money toward
paying the settlement amounts as soon as she started working.   Applicant testified that
she has paid off all of the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR except one, allegation
