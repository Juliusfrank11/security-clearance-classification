The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of September 24, 2019, Applicant owed
four credit-card debts in collection for $6,367 (SOR ¶ 1.a), $6,344 (SOR ¶ 1.b), $929 (SOR
¶ 1.e), and $1,430 (SOR ¶ 1.f), and two loans charged off for $14,282 (SOR ¶ 1.c) and
$2,852  (SOR  ¶  1.d).  Applicant  admitted  the  debts,  which  he  explained  were  incurred
because  of  attorney  fees  for  his  divorce  that  was  finalized  in  February  2009;  travel
expenses to see his son when his ex-wife had primary custody; child support for his son
until July 2014 when he became the custodial parent; non-payment of child support by his
ex-wife since July 2014; and a June 2018 apartment fire in which he lost everything. He
indicated that he had taken care of some debts not alleged in the SOR, and that he was in
the process of contacting his creditors to arrange repayment terms for the SOR debts,
starting with the smallest debt. (Answer.)
Applicant’s admissions to the SOR debts are accepted and incorporated as findings
of fact. After considering the pleadings, the exhibits, and the hearing transcript, I make the
following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  40-year-old  task  manager.  He  began  working  as  an  engineering
technician for a defense contractor in March 2011. He became an employee of his current
employer in October 2014, when the company acquired the contract. He holds a DOD
clearance, which he needs to maintain for his job. (GE 1; AE D; Tr. 14.) Applicant served
honorably on active duty in the United States Navy, holding either a secret or top secret
clearance, from July 1999 to February 2011 when he was discharged at the rank of petty
officer second class (E-5) for failure to meet physical readiness standards. (AE H; Tr. 43.)
He earned an associate’s degree in April 2011 and two bachelor’s degrees in April 2012
and April 2013, respectively. (GE 1.)
Applicant mismanaged credit extended to him during his early years in the Navy. He
obtained two credit cards on which he reached his credit limit. After making the monthly
minimum  payments  on the  cards  for  about  a year, he stopped paying on them. At the
urging of his then fiancée in 2003, he contacted the entities pursuing him for collection and
settled in full a charged-off MasterCard account for $576 in March 2004 and a Visa account
for $339 in May 2005. He satisfied a $2,301 debt in collection for a computer in January
2005. (GEs 2, 5-6.) Applicant did not report any delinquencies on his April 2005 security
clearance application (SF 86) because he had paid or settled the debts, or in the case of a
$2,013  debt  on  his  credit  record  for  testing materials  and  books,  he  disputed the  debt
because he did not receive all the materials ordered. (GEs 5-6.) On January 31, 2006, the
Department of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility (DON CAF) notified Applicant of its
intent  to  deny  him  continued  security  clearance  eligibility  because  of  the  delinquent
accounts  on  his  credit  record  and  his  failure  to  report  them  on  his  SF  86.  (GE  5.)  On
February  28,  2006,  Applicant  provided  evidence  of  debt  resolution  for  the  Visa,
MasterCard, and computer debts, and explained that he was in financial counseling. (GE
6.) On April 10, 2006, the DON CAF granted Applicant a top secret clearance and eligibility
for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI), but cautioned him that any future
derogatory  information,  especially  of  a  similar  nature,  would  be  cause  for  immediate
reconsideration of the favorable security determination. (GE 7; Tr. 39, 47.)
On January 31, 2006, Applicant and his ex-wife married in October 2003, had a son
in January 2004, and divorced in February 2009. (GE 1; AE F.) He moved into military
barracks on their separation in December 2007. (GE 1.) On their divorce, she became
primary custodial parent of their son. Applicant was required to pay child support at $168
per  week  and  51%  of  their  son’s  daycare  and  medical  expenses  not  reimbursed  by
insurance. (AE F.)
Applicant and his ex-wife had no joint bank deposits or other assets to divide. They
retained individual responsibility for their own debts. Applicant retained possession of his
vehicle, a 2004 model-year Jeep, purchased in October 2008 with a loan for $25,249 from
the credit union (SOR ¶ 1.c). (GE 4; AE F.) He also had some open credit-card accounts,
including  two  accounts  with  a  credit  union  opened  in  March  2008.  He  obtained  a
MasterCard (SOR ¶ 1.b) with the credit union to pay his divorce attorney’s fees of more
than $4,000 (Tr. 80-81) and “inadvertently” opened a VISA account (SOR ¶ 1.a) at the
same time. He “racked up” debt on the credit cards, “not making the smartest decisions.”
(Tr. 36.) Shortly after his divorce was final, he obtained a $5,000 loan from the credit union
(SOR ¶ 1.d) in March 2009 to cover the security deposit and purchase furnishings for an
apartment  that  he  planned  to  share  with  his  then  girlfriend.  After  he  paid  the  security
deposit, the plan fell through, and he rented an apartment on his own for the next year.
(GEs 1, 4.) He used some of the loan money for living expenses, including food. (Tr. 61-
64.)
In April 2010, Applicant relocated to another state for his military duties. For the next
few years, he incurred mileage, gasoline, and entertainment expenses to see his son one
weekend  each  month.  (GE  1;  AEs  F-G,  J;  Tr.  35.)  Three  credit-card  debts  became
seriously delinquent during this time: a $2,022 debt from July 2010 (not alleged); an $8,200
military exchange credit-card debt from December 2010 (not alleged); and a $1,125 debt
from April 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.f). (GEs 1, 4.)
On his discharge from the military, Applicant began working for a defense contractor
in March 2011, but his monthly income was about $1,600 less per month than what he had
earned in the military. He continued to pay his child support and daycare obligations on
time at $375 every two weeks. (AEs J-K; Tr. 36.)
By early 2012, Applicant’s Jeep was having mechanical difficulties. He tried to trade
it in without success. In February 2012, he bought a 2006 model-year automobile with a
loan for $15,375, and abandoned his Jeep at the roadside. (AE F; Tr. 57-63.) He made
timely payments for his new car (GE 4), but over the next three months, he stopped paying
on his four accounts with the credit union (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d). He testified that he was told by
a car dealer to stop paying on the loan for the Jeep (SOR ¶ 1.c). (Tr. 60.) As of July 2013,
his MasterCard and Visa accounts with the credit union were in collection for $6,367 (SOR
¶ 1.a) and $6,344 (SOR ¶ 1.b). His vehicle and personal loans with the credit union were
charged off for $14,282 (SOR ¶ 1.c) and $2,852 (SOR ¶ 1.d), respectively. (GE 4; AE F.)
He also owed credit-card collection balances to other creditors: $929 from May 2012 (SOR
¶ 1.e), $1,430 (placed for $1,125) from April 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.f), and $2,022 from July 2010
(not alleged). The $8,200 credit-card debt (not alleged) that had been seriously past due
had not been fully repaid. (GEs 1, 4.)
In late July 2014, Applicant became the primary custodial parent for his son. In a
post-judgment decree, the court terminated Applicant’s obligation to pay child support and
ordered his ex-wife to pay $30 per week in child support plus 38% of unreimbursed medical
and daycare expenses for their son. (AE F; Tr. 37-38.) Applicant’s ex-wife did not pay any
child support or reimburse Applicant for any of their son’s medical expenses. (AE J; Tr. 69-
70.) Their son, who has been diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, had therapy for almost two
years after Applicant became the primary custodial parent. (Tr. 67-70.) Applicant did not
provide any details about the extent of his co-payments for his son’s care.
In October  2014,  Applicant  began working for  his  current  employer.  (GE 1.) On
December 2, 2016, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an SF 86 for his
ten-year update of his security clearance eligibility. (GE 1; Tr. 34.) In response to financial
record inquiries concerning delinquency involving routine accounts, Applicant listed three
credit-card debts of $2,021 ($2,022 in collection on his credit report, not alleged in SOR),
$6,303 (debt originally $8,200, not alleged), and $929 (SOR ¶ 1.e), and two medical debts
of $340 and $916 (not alleged). He did not list his four delinquent debts with the credit
union on his SF 86. Applicant cited his divorce and having primary custody of his son as the
reasons for the debts. As for efforts to resolve the debts, Applicant stated with respect to
each debt, “Currently developing long term goal to figure out a course of action to resolve
this debt.” He explained that his tax refunds were taken and applied to the $8,200 credit-
card debt. (GE 1; Tr. 49.) The evidence shows that he fully resolved that debt in June 2018,
in part by paying $400 a month from about September 2017 to June 2018. (GE 4; AE G; Tr.
37, 49-50.)
In December 2016, Applicant bought a new car with a loan of $26,571, to be repaid
at $489 per month. As of May 2019, he had not been late in any of his payments and had
paid down the loan balance to $18,369. (GE 3.)
As of March 2017, Applicant’s credit report showed no progress on the delinquent
accounts in the SOR or on the $2,022 debt (not alleged). Applicant was making timely
payments on two active credit-card accounts: an account held since December 2004 with a
current balance of $1,906, and an account held since April 2016 with a current balance of
$1,445. (GE 4.)
In early June 2018, Applicant had a devastating fire in his apartment. He lost all of
his possessions, including his financial paperwork. (GE 2; AE J; Tr. 35-36.) He had renter’s
insurance  for  $20,000.  He  filed  a  claim  for  $32,687  as  the  cost  of  replacement  for  his
belongings. The insurer discounted the value to $21,246 due to depreciation. He was paid
$1,000 upfront and $19,000 when his claim was processed. (AE M; Tr. 35.)
Applicant and his son lived in a hotel room after the fire. Applicant had insurance that
covered the difference between the rent he had paid for the apartment ($900 per month)
and the cost of the hotel room. (Tr. 87.) He was unable to find an apartment for rent at less
than  $1,400  a  month,  so  in  July  2018  he  bought  a  home  built  in  1880  that  had  been
renovated. (AE J; Tr. 86.) He obtained a mortgage loan of $152,518 to be repaid at $1,169
per month. (GE 3; AE E.) On the advice of the mortgage company, some of the insurance
payout from the fire went to reduce the balances on his active credit cards so that he would
qualify for a mortgage. (Tr. 54-55.) About $2,600 of the insurance payout was used for the
down payment on his new home. (Tr. 84.)
Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) on September 21, 2018. He explained he began repaying the $8,200
credit-card delinquency after he was notified that his wages were to be garnished, and the
debt was paid off in June 2018. He stated that he was paying off his smaller bills and
working to address his larger ones. He acknowledged a credit card delinquency of $1,430
on the account in SOR ¶ 1.f. He recognized the credit-union debts in SOR ¶ 1.c and 1.d as
his debts, but indicated that they had been written off. He could not provide any information
about the debts because he had not received any statements from the credit union in a
long time. He did not dispute the $929 debt in collection (SOR ¶ 1.e), but was unable to
provide any information about that debt. Applicant described his current credit as decent,
citing his recent house purchase and improved budgeting. (GE 2.)
On April 8, 2019, Applicant was re-interviewed by the investigator. He stated that he
was “plugging away” at a $583 collection debt (not alleged) that, according to his March
2017 credit report, had been placed for collection in October 2012. Applicant indicated that
the  $2,022  credit  card  debt  (not  alleged)  had  been  charged  off  in  February  2014.  He
explained that he was trying to save money to repay his debts. Applicant admitted the
credit-card delinquencies with the credit union (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b) when confronted, and
expressed his belief they had been charged off. He attributed those delinquencies to his
divorce. (GE 2.)
As of June 2019, Equifax was reporting no delinquency trades on Applicant’s credit
record. The SOR delinquencies had been dropped from his credit record with no evidence
of  any  payments.  Applicant  was  making  timely  monthly  payments  of  $1,169  on  his
mortgage; $489 on his December 2016 car loan; $206 on an unsecured loan obtained in
March  2019  for  $7,500;  and  on  five  active  credit-card  accounts  with  balances  totaling
$6,701, which required a total of $198 in monthly minimum payments. (GE 3.) His new
home needed a new oven, refrigerator, doors, microwave, and central air conditioning,
some or all of which he paid for with credit. (AE J.) He testified that the home also needed
new doors and new basement-support jacking posts. (Tr. 85.)
Applicant continued to take on new credit as the delinquencies in the SOR went
unresolved.  In  June  2019,  he  obtained  a  credit  card  with  a  $750  limit  from  a  home-
improvement retailer. As of July 2019, the balance on that account was $375. In August
2019, he opened a revolving charge account with a $500 credit limit with another creditor.
As of September 2019, the balance was $264. (AE E.)
After  his  May  2019  annual  review,  Applicant  was  promoted  at  work  to  a  task
manager and engineering technician 5 position. His hourly wage increased from $28 to
$32. His take-home pay is now “a little over $1,900” every two weeks. (Tr. 44-45; 84.) He
understands from his supervisor that he will no longer be employed if he does not retain
security clearance eligibility. (Tr. 46.) He received income tax refunds of approximately
$200 each for tax years 2018 and 2019 because he did not claim his son as a dependent
on his returns. (Tr. 50-51.) His ex-wife claimed their son on her returns. (Tr. 52.)
On September 24, 2019, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant because of
unresolved  delinquencies  on  six  accounts  totaling  $32,204.  In  his  October  15,  2019
Answer, Applicant cited those debts which had been resolved for his clearance in 2006 and
the $8,200 credit-card debt satisfied in June 2018 as evidence that he has the initiative and
willpower to pay his debts, “given the proper time.” He indicated that he had spoken with a
financial advisor to discuss options to resolve his debts; that he was in the process of
contacting his creditors to work out payment plans, starting with the smallest debt first; and
that he was considering a second job for extra income, but “it has been tough looking for
one  that  would  work  for  [his]  work  schedule,  [his]  son’s  needs,  and  to  be  able  to  still
function mentally.” (Answer.)
Applicant continued to make timely payments on his open accounts (his mortgage,
car loan, unsecured loan, and credit cards). As of January 2020, he had eight open credit
cards with balances totaling $10,735, which was less than his credit limit of $12,350, but
with balances generally trending upward in recent months even with paying the monthly
minimum or slightly more than the minimum on some accounts. (AE E; Tr. 79.) None of the
three credit reporting agencies reported any delinquencies on his credit record. (AE E.)
In December 2019, Applicant formulated a plan to resolve his debts. (Tr. 73.) In
January 2020, Applicant refinanced his car loan for $17,394, which lowered his monthly
payment  from  $489  to  $298.  (AE  C.)  In  mid-February  2020,  Applicant  refinanced  his
mortgage for more than the $150,755 he owed on his previous mortgage, but at a lower
interest rate than his previous loan. He was unable to recall the amount of his loan at his
hearing. (AE A; Tr. 74, 78.)
As of his March 2020 hearing, Applicant had made no payments on any of the SOR
debts.  (Tr.  38,  55-56.)  He  expressed  his  intent  to  contact  his  creditors  and  work  out
payment plans “once things level out.” (Tr. 38.) He planned to take the funds saved from
lowering his mortgage and car payments and pay the SOR debts, starting with the smallest
(SOR ¶ 1.e). (Tr. 64-65, 71.) As to why he had not made any arrangements with the credit
union to resolve the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d, despite the fact that the debts had been
brought to his attention during his OPM interviews, Applicant responded:
So for those — I, being honest here, those were going to be later. I was
going  to  take  care  of  these  smaller  ones,  first,  once  everything  was
adjudicated, the fire, the refinancing, and all that stuff, waiting on it leveling
out. And every time I tried to do this, something comes up that costs, like,
$500, $700, $750. (Tr. 53.)
Applicant decided against seeking a second job because of his son and instead
chose to refinance his car and mortgage loans to lower his monthly payments. His first
payment on his new mortgage was not due until April 1, 2020. He expected a refund of
more than $700 in escrow funds from his previous mortgage, and a check for the difference
between his new loan and the $150,755 that went to satisfy his previous mortgage. (AE A;
Tr. 73.) He testified that with those funds, he would be able to satisfy the debts in SOR ¶¶
1.e and 1.f, if not also the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d. (Tr. 73-74.)
As of March 2020, he had $5 in his savings account and $1,400 in his checking
account. He “essentially” lives from paycheck to paycheck. (Tr. 65-66.) He also indicated
that his son gets emotional and sometimes has suicidal thoughts, and so he gives him $20
here and there. (Tr. 67.) When asked for assurances that he would move forward and take
care of his debts, Applicant admitted that he had not acted as he should have but that
some of his co-workers know about the issue and “they have kept [him], try to keep the fire,
for a lack of better term, underneath [his] butt.” (Tr. 72.)
On April 24, 2020, I informed Applicant that I would consider re-opening the record
at his request to provide him an opportunity to supplement the record. There being no
objections from the Government, on April 28, 2020, I re-opened the record for post-hearing
submissions at Applicant’s request. Applicant was given a May 12, 2020 deadline.
On April 29, 2020, a collection entity for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e notified Applicant that
it would settle his $929 balance for $557 payable in five installments starting May 29, 2020.
(AE Q.) On May 7, 2020, Applicant paid $557 and the debt was settled in full. (AEs O, P,
R.)
On May 8, 2020, Applicant began making payments of $150 a month to the credit
union toward resolving the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d. (AE N, P.) It is unclear how the credit
union plans to apply those payments; whether the credit union is willing to settle for less
than the full balances owed on the four accounts; or when the debts will be resolved.
Work Performance
Evaluation Report and Counseling Records for his military performance from August
2004 to February 2011 reflect that Applicant was a hardworking and dedicated sailor with a
flexible leadership style and positive attitude. He was often rated as a must promote or
early  promote  despite  having  failed  three  physical  fitness  assessments  in  a  four-year
period. He sought increased responsibilities and routinely greatly exceeded standards in
terms of professional knowledge. His military evaluation on his discharge shows that he
remained  productive  and  knowledgeable,  needed  minimal  supervision,  and  showed
tremendous initiative. He wanted to stay in the Navy, but he could not meet the physical
readiness standards. (AE D; Tr. 43.) Applicant received several commendations while in
the Navy for his duty performance between June 2000 and June 2006. He was awarded
the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal for his achievements from February 2006
to June 2006.
As s defense contractor employee, Applicant received a letter of commendation from
the  Navy  in  January  2013  for  being  instrumental  in  overhauling  planned  maintenance
procedures for a submarine sonar system. He was lauded for his positive mental attitude,
expert knowledge, and dogged attention to detail. (AE I.) At his annual review in January
2013, Applicant was given the highest rating in several categories and recommended for
immediate  promotion.  (AE  D.)  In  February  2013,  his  then  employer  recognized  his
outstanding performance with an award of excellence. (AE I.)
Applicant  displayed  similar  dedication  in  his  work  for  his  current  employer,  who
recognized his professionalism and contributions in April 2016 and June 2019. In June
2019, he received a $100 cash award from his employer for an outstanding job as a quality
assurance reviewer on a successful task that “cast a shining beacon on the work and ability
of [his employer] to get the job done.” (AE I.) Additionally, Applicant received several emails
in  his  current  job  from  co-workers  and  his  company’s  military  customer  commenting
favorably about his consistently high level of service and hard work. (AE B.) His annual
performance appraisals since he began his current employment show that he is held in high
regard  for  his  initiative,  job  knowledge,  leadership  on  the  job,  quality  of  his  work,  and
teamwork. He has consistently exceeded his employer’s expectations and is considered a
major  contributor.  As  a  task  manager  since  2017,  he  has  significantly  exceeded
requirements as to performing his tasks in a time and cost-saving manner, handling extra
assignments, and contributing to positive customer relations. He requires little supervision.
(AE D.)
In October 2015, in late July 2016, and in December 2019, Applicant notified his
employer of possible spillage of a classified drawing onto his workstation. In all instances,
the document was determined to be unclassified but bore improper or unclear markings.
(AE L.)
Two of Applicant’s co-workers testified on his behalf. A co-worker on the technical
engineering side of their workgroup has known Applicant since January 2016. He now
works  for  the  primary  contractor  who  took  over  the  contract  in  December  2019.  While
Applicant’s employer is now a “minority partner,” this co-worker and Applicant continue to
work together. He attests that Applicant is very professional and a hard worker, including in
his role on the recreation and morale committee at work. This co-worker knows little of the
details  of  Applicant’s  financial  situation,  but  he  understands  that  Applicant  is  a  single
parent,  had  a  fire,  and  purchased  a  new  home.  He  believes  Applicant  will  pay  off  his
outstanding debts based on the responsible behavior he has demonstrated at work. He
opined that Applicant has “a bright future” if he can keep his clearance. (Tr. 89-94.)
A  project  manager,  who  signed  off  on  Applicant’s  most  recent  performance
evaluations as a second-level supervisor, testified that Applicant has proven his capabilities
over and over. Applicant is trusted by their government customer and upper management.
This supervisor is aware that Applicant has had some financial difficulties, caused in part by
his apartment fire and other circumstances not his fault. Applicant’s financial issues first
came to the manager’s attention some time ago when a garnishment issue arose. He is
aware that Applicant has also had to deal with issues involving his son, who lost two of his
best friends to suicide in the last couple of years. Despite these struggles, Applicant gives
his  best  effort  every  day.  The  supervisor  believes  Applicant  is  “on  the  right  track”  by
refinancing his mortgage and car loans to free up funds so that he can pay his old debts.
He  believes  Applicant  will  be  able  to  resolve  the  debts  over  time.  In  this  supervisor’s
opinion, should Applicant lose his security clearance, it would damage the company and
their government customer who rely on his expertise. He considers Applicant to be one of
his  best  technicians,  if  not  the  best,  and  attests  that  Applicant’s  handling  of  classified
information is above reproach. He does not think Applicant is a security risk. (Tr. 98-108,
113.)
