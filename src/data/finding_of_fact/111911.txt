Applicant,  age  45,  is  divorced,  remarried  in  2011  and  has  six  children.  She
graduated from high school in 1992 and has taken college courses for several years but
has  not  yet  obtained  her  undergraduate  degree.  Applicant  completed  her  security
clearance application on February 9, 2018. She has held a security clearance since 2007.
She has been employed as a contractor since 2003. She has been employed with her
current employer since 2015 as a program analyst. (GE 1)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  nine  delinquents  totaling  approximately
$38,000.  Applicant admitted the SOR allegations with the exception of 1.a, and 1.c. and
provided explanations. She did not believe the amount of the debt was accurate for 1.a
and 1.c.
Applicant acknowledged her financial problems and her delinquent debts although
she disagreed with the amounts. She attributed them to raising her three children as a
single mother for many years. She also stated that she was a victim of identity theft and
that higher prices in health insurance in 2015, have contributed to her financial instability.
However,  she  was  adamant  that  given  her  stellar  government  career  and  various
promotions, she should not be judged by how her finances appear. (Tr.18) She presented
evidence that she just received a promotion. (AE B) She is adamant that this is a financial
lapse of judgment in her obligations but does not undermine her 20 years of excellent
service to the Government. (Tr.81) She stated that she has never had a security violation
and would never sell U.S. secrets. She claims that she is very reliable.
Applicant also stated that at one point she moved to another state to live with her
sister so that she could save money. She lived there for about six months, but returned
and had difficulty finding a place for her and her three children to live due to expensive
rent.  She  kept  delaying  financial  counseling  because  she  “wanted  to  get  her  credit
straight.” She has recently set up a meeting to obtain financial counseling. (Tr. 39, AE A)
Applicant  denied  the  debt  in  SOR  allegation  1.a,  a  charged-off  account  in  the
amount of $17,008, because it was the result of a van that burned and was a total loss.
Applicant purchased the vehicle in 2014 and in 2018 the insurance company evaluated it
as  a  total  loss  and  settled.  Applicant  avers  that  a  payment  of  $8,360  was  sent  to  this
account and she believes the charge-off amount is not $17,008.  (Tr. 21) However, she
did not produce any evidence to confirm her assertion. Her credit report confirms that she
owes $17,008. (GE 2, 3)
As  to  SOR  allegation  1.b,  a  charged-off  account  in  the  amount  of  $12,699,
Applicant stopped making payment in March 2017 because she could no longer afford
them. This was a car loan and Applicant had been making payments of $20 a month. The
car was repossessed. (Tr. 25)
SOR allegation 1.c, a collection account in the amount of $613, Applicant denied
the allegation, but stated that she has never made any payments on the account, which
was opened in 2016. She believes this is a duplicate of 1.e.
SOR allegation 1.d, a collection account in the amount of $600 was related to items
in an apartment in 2014. Applicant has not taken any steps to resolve this account. (Tr.28)
As  to  SOR  allegation  1.e,  a  charged-off  account  in  the  amount  of  $553,  a  last
payment was made in 2015. It is not resolved. (Tr. 28)
As to SOR allegation 1.f, a collection account in the amount of $471, this credit
card became delinquent in 2014 and is not resolved. (Tr. 28)
SOR allegation 1.g, is a credit card in collection for $435 that went to collection in
2019, but the last payment was in 2017. This is not resolved.
SOR allegation 1.h, is a charged-off account in the amount of $5,629. The account
was for furniture that was bought and not paid for. (Tr. 48) Applicant has not attempted to
resolve this account but stated that she is going to set up credit counseling so that she
could set up a payment plan. (Tr. 29) The account is unresolved.
SOR allegation 1.i is a charged-off credit account in the amount of $129. The card
was charged off in 2012. Applicant has not made any efforts to address this account. (Tr.
30)
At the hearing, the SOR was amended to include an SOR allegation 1.j, to reflect
that Applicant has not timely filed her 2018 income tax returns for both Federal and state.
(Tr. 43) She has not requested an extension and admitted that she had no good reason
for not filing. She stated that she just hasn’t made time to file. (Tr.42)
Applicant’s husband who she married in 2011, earns about $25 an hour. (Tr. 67)
He worked as an Uber driver and related how he had an accident in 2009 involving the
issue alleged in SOR 1.a. The vehicle was totaled. In 2011 and 2012 two other vehicles
were purchased. Applicant’s husband lost the Uber job in 2016, and they could not keep
up with the payments. He blames himself for these issues. (Tr.47) However, he believes
the correct amount should be $7,000 or $8,000. Neither Applicant nor her husband has
any documentation to confirm the assertions. (Tr. 56)
Applicant’s husband also invested in a food truck for his wife. He took out a loan
for $10,000 in his name and was making monthly payments of $246.  However, the food
truck has not passed all the regulatory inspections or licensing requirements and the truck
is just sitting. Applicant is not able to make the payments on the loan. Thus, Applicant
can’t use it to generate extra income. Her husband stated that he did not understand the
severity of the matter regarding his wife’s security clearance.  Her husband pointed out
that Applicant is paying college tuition for one child.
In Applicant’s 2018 subject interview, she explained that she and her husband took
a five day cruise to the Bahamas (Tr. 38).  She had other debts that were resolved by
garnishment or she has paid as required. (GE 7) She affirmed, however, that none of the
debts listed on the SOR have been paid or are in a payment plan. (Tr.75) Her husband
took out a $10,000 loan for the food truck in 2018 when they already had delinquent debts.
Applicant  currently  earns  about  $75,000  a  year  and  she  has  been  consistently
employed.  She has not had any financial counseling, but has made an appointment. She
has a budget. It is not clear what the monthly net remainder is in her budget.
Applicant  submitted  as  post-hearing  documentation  letters  from  an  insurance
company  concerning  the amount  owed  in  SOR  allegation  1.a  ,  but  does not  state that
there is no balance owing. (AE D, E) She stated in her post-hearing statement that she
has started financial counseling.
