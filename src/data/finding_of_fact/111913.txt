Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.k, with explanations, but denied the remaining
allegations in ¶¶ 1.l-1.r. His admissions are incorporated into these findings of fact. After
a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working
at  his  present  job  as  a  test  specialist  in  July  2014.  He  has  worked  for  this  contractor
since  July  2009,  except  when  he  was  laid  off  from  November  2013  to  July  2014.  He
holds  an  associate’s  degree.  He  married  in  1997,  divorced  in  2002,  and  he  has  two
adult children. He was the custodial parent for his children when they were minors. (Tr.
6, 17-20; GE 1, 3)
The SOR alleged that Applicant had 18 student loans in collection status totaling
$47,966. The debts were listed on a credit report from January 2019. (GE 4)
Applicant  incurred  student-loan  debt  while  attending  technical  school  to  receive
his associate’s degree from 2005-2007. The school he attended ultimately went out of
business. He credibly testified that seven of the delinquent student loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-
1.g) were transferred or sold to a collection agent (SOR ¶¶ 1.l-1.r). He has been making
approximately $500 monthly payments through wage garnishment since approximately
late 2016. While Applicant did not provide documentation showing the transfer or sale of
the  student  loans,  he  provided  copies  of  his  bi-monthly  earnings  statement  starting  in
February 2017 (this was as far back as his company’s records could go) through August
2017, and from August 2019 through February 2020, which corroborate his student loan
payments  (I  told  Applicant  to  provide  a  representative  sampling  of  his  earnings
statements to include six months showing the start of his payments and six months from
the  present  time, which  he did. He  was  not  asked to provide  statements for the  entire
time period). (Tr. 19-25; AE A)
that
testified
Applicant
the  amount  of  his  original  student
loans  was
approximately $32,000. He provided documentation showing that his current balance is
approximately  $16,700.  Applicant  admitted  having  a  sporadic  student-loan  payment
history before the garnishment order in 2016. The reasons for his interrupted payments
included periods of unemployment and trying to provide for his two minor children as the
sole  income  provider.  After  the  garnishment  order,  Applicant  did  not  receive  any
correspondence from any creditors or collection services about his student loans. Four
student  loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.h-1.k)  are  shown  on  the  Government’s  most  recent  credit
report as assigned to a government collection account. (Tr. 25-27; GE 5; AE A-B)
Applicant  indicated  that  his  current  financial  status  is  much  improved.  He  is
currently living with and caring for his elderly mother who owns her home, thus negating
any rent for Applicant. He provided a recent credit report showing that he only has two
accounts, his student loans and a car payment. He is current on both accounts.
