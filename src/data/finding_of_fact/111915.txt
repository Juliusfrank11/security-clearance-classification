Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations,  with  explanations,  and  his  admissions
are  incorporated  into  these  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He began working
at  his  present  job  as  a  communications  security  manager  in  July  2018.  He  holds  a
bachelor’s and two associate’s degrees. He served in the U.S. Army from 2009 to 2013.
He  deployed  to  Iraq  for  a  year  and  received  an  Army  Commendation  Medal  for  his
service  there.  He  was  an  intelligence  analyst  and  held  a  top  secret  clearance  at  that
time.  He  separated  with  an  honorable  discharge  as  a  specialist  (E-4).  He  married  in
2012, and he has two children. (Tr. 5, 21, 23; Answer; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  four  charged-off  debts  and  one  collection
debt  totaling  approximately  $14,745.  The  SOR  went  on  to  allege  six  private  student
loans in collection status totaling $31,738. The debts were listed on credit reports from
January 2019, July 2019, and December 2019.
Applicant  credibly  testified  that  six  of  the  debts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.g-1.l)  were  from
delinquent  private  student  loans  he  took  out  to  help  pay  for  college  in  2005  to  2007,
before he joined the Army.  Because of his academic standing, he was required to use
private student loans to pay for college. He accumulated approximately $65,000 worth
of  student  loans.  He  realized  that  he  could  never  pay  these  loans  with  the  college
degree he had chosen. He joined the Army and paid his student loans directly from his
paycheck,  reducing  the  overall  balance  to  approximately  $30,000.  His  payment
assertions are corroborated by his January 2010 credit report that showed the student
loans  in  good  standing.  These  student  loans  went  into  delinquent  status  after
Applicant’s  discharge,  during  his  unemployment,  and  after  his  deferments  expired.
None  of  these  private  student  loans  appear  on  Applicant’s  two  most  recent  credit
reports contained in the record. (Tr. 24, 27-29; Answer; GE 3, 7-8)
After his honorable service in the Army, Applicant believed his background as an
intelligence  analyst  put  him  in  a  good  position  to  obtain  a  civilian  contractor  position.
This  was  not  the  case,  and  he  struggled  to  provide  for  his  family  during  extended
periods  of  unemployment  (July  2013-September  2015;  January  2016-March  2016;
October  2016-May  2017;  May  2018-July2018)  and  part-time  employment  (September
2015-January  2016;  January  2018-May  2018).  He  went  back  to  college  and  obtained
his  bachelor’s  degree  in  2014  using  his  GI-Bill  benefits  and  securing  federal  student
loans. He also earned two associate’s degrees. (Tr. 21-23)
Applicant established two lines of credit from banks while in the Army in an effort
to  establish  a  good  credit  resume  and  raise  his  credit  score.  While  on  active  duty  he
borrowed against the credit lines  and then repaid them. When he was discharged and
became  unemployed,  he  was  unable  to  continue  his  payments  on  these  credit  lines.
This  resulted  in  the  charged-off  debts  listed  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.b  and  1.d-1.e.  Applicant
credibly testified that he has attempted to negotiate payment plans with the two banks,
but  they  only  will  accept  lump-sum  payments,  which  Applicant  is  unable  to  afford.  He
intends  to  pay  these  credit  lines  when  he  accumulates  the  needed  finances  to  do  so.
Applicant’s payment plan includes using the approximately $7,000 bonus he will receive
shortly  and  his 2019 federal  income  tax  refund,  which  he  expects to be approximately
$10,000 to pay the outstanding credit lines, as well as the deficiency balance on an auto
repossession (SOR ¶ 1.c).  Applicant’s current annual salary is approximately $75,000.
He is current on his rent and both of his older model vehicles are paid.  His wife works
part  time,  but  mostly  provides  child  care  for  their  two  young  children,  which  would
otherwise  cost  approximately  $1,900  monthly.  Applicant  provided  a  reference  number
indicating his payment of the consumer debt listed at SOR ¶ 1.f. (Tr. 23-25, 35, 37-40;
Answer; AE D)
Applicant documented his regular payments on his federal student loans, which
he  incurred  while  completing  his  bachelor’s  and  associates’  degrees.  He  intends  to
continue making these student-loan payments. (Tr. 34, 42; AE B-C)
Applicant  provided  letters  of  support  from  his  former  supervisor,  who  was  also
the former facility security officer (FSO), and his current supervisor, who is the current
FSO.  Both  have  the  highest  regard  for  Applicant.  Applicant  disclosed  his  financial
difficulties  to  both  people  and  they  believe  he  is  on  his  way  to  financial  recovery.
Applicant is characterized as a trusted team member who is totally reliable. His former
supervisor recommended the retention of Applicant’s clearance. (Answer)
