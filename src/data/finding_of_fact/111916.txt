Applicant, age 60, is married with one adult child. He earned a bachelor’s degree
in  1982  and  a  master’s  degree  in  1988.  He  has  held  a  DOD  security  clearance  since
1983.  He  has  been  employed  full  time  as  an  engineer  by  a  defense  contractor  since
2001, and part time as a lecturer by a state university since 2013. (SCA1, SCA2)
Applicant  accumulated  significant  debts  due  to  his  and  his  wife’s  excessive
spending  which  led  them  to  file  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  in  November  2012.  Their
reported  liabilities  totaled  $481,890,  including  a  $346,217  home-mortgage  account,  a
$7,000 tax debt, and unsecured debts totaling $125,526. They paid $170,174 during a
period of  59  months  pursuant  to  the  Chapter 13  repayment plan. The  bankruptcy  was
discharged in January 2018. (Item 7 at 10; Item 8)
Applicant  failed  to  file,  as  required,  his  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for
tax years 2012 through 2018 for reasons he did not specify in the record. Those returns
remain  unfiled.  The  $7,000  tax  debt  reported  during  his  bankruptcy  related  to  state
income taxes for tax years 2013 through 2016, which he repaid in 2018. As of January
2019,  he  owed  $80,000  in  federal  income  taxes  for  tax  years  2013  through  2017.  He
attributed his delinquent taxes to excessive spending during those tax years. In January
2019,  he  anticipated  setting  up  a  repayment  plan  to  resolve  his  federal  tax  debts.  In
August 2019, he anticipated making a $500 payment to the IRS in September 2019.  In
his  January  2020  SOR  answer,  in  an  apparent  reference  to  his  federal  tax  debts,  he
stated  that  he  “payed  some  liens”  and  was  “paying  increased  taxes”  toward  “eventual
compliance.” He did not provide any documents corroborating agreements or payments
to resolve his federal tax debts. Since his delinquent federal taxes were not alleged in
the  SOR,  they  will  be  considered  only  in  the  context  of  evaluating  the  whole  person
concept and mitigation. (Item 3; Item 7 at 10-11, 16-17)
Between  approximately  2000  and  2017,  Applicant  misused  his  company-issued
credit  card  by  paying  for  personal  expenses  related  to  the  long-distance  commute
between his home and work, including gas, meals, and hotels. During the period when
he misused the credit card, he was aware of his company’s policy that it could only be
used  for  authorized  work-related  expenses.  He  was  not  confronted  about  his  misuse
until February 2017, at which time the policy was reiterated to him and he was required
to  complete  follow-up  training  related  to  proper  use  of  the  credit  card.  His  employer
estimated that Applicant charged personal expenses to his company-issued credit card
totaling $109,514 between February 2008 and February 2017. Applicant estimated that
the  total  personal expenses  he  charged  was  approximately  $1,000,000  between  2000
and 2016. (Item 5 at 13, 39-40; Item 6; Item 7 at 11)
Applicant  answered  “no”  to  each  question  on  SCA1  about  his  financial  record,
including whether, in the last seven years, he had filed a petition for bankruptcy or failed
to file his federal or state tax returns or pay his federal or state taxes. He affirmed those
“no” responses in October 2015 by certifying that “my statements on this form . . . are
true,  complete,  and  correct  to  the  best  of  my  knowledge  and  belief  and  are  made  in
good faith.”  (Item 4 at 34-35)
On  SCA2,  Applicant  reported  his  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  filing,  his  failure  to  file
his federal tax return and pay approximately $7,000 in federal taxes for tax year 2012,
and  his  credit-card  misuse.  He  affirmed  those  responses  in  March  2018  by  certifying
that “my statements on this form . . . are true, complete, and correct to the best of my
knowledge and belief and are made in good faith.” (Item 5 at 38-39, 40-41)
Applicant  was  interviewed  in  January  2019  in  connection  with  his  security-
clearance investigation to discuss, among other things, the contents of SCA2. He was
forthcoming  about  the  facts  and  circumstances  surrounding  his  derogatory  financial
history,  including  facts  that  were  not  disclosed  on  SCA1 or SCA2.  He  claimed  that  he
did not report his failure to file state tax returns and pay state taxes for tax years 2012
through 2016 on SCA2 due to oversight. He did not address why he had not disclosed
his failure to file federal tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2016 on SCA2. He also
claimed that he listed owing $7,000 in federal taxes on SCA2 because he believed that
was  the  total  amount  that  he  owed  at  the  time,  and  only  later  learned  that  the  $7,000
amount  related  to  his  state  taxes  and  that  he  actually  owed  $80,000  in  federal  taxes.
(Item 7 at 10-11)
In January 2019, Applicant asserted that his overall financial status had improved
after  he  completed  the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  process.  He  acknowledged  that  he
remained  in  arrears  with  his  tax  payments,  but  was  timely  meeting  his  other  financial
obligations  and  had  eliminated  the  use  of  credit  cards.  He  reported  a  monthly  net
remainder  of  about  $2,000,  taking  into  consideration  his  and  his  wife’s  income  and
expenses,  which  included  amounts  he  anticipated  spending  to  repay  his  taxes.  In
January  2020,  Applicant  argued  that  the  successful  discharge  of  his  Chapter  13
bankruptcy  demonstrated  his  ability  to  manage  his  finances.  He  and  his  wife  both
completed  a  financial  management  course  in  connection  with  their  Chapter  13
bankruptcy. (Item 3; Item 7 at 9-10; Item 8 at 8-9)
In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted each of the Guideline F and Guideline E
allegations.  He  admitted  that  he  deliberately  failed  to  disclose  his  Chapter  13
bankruptcy and his failure to file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2012
through  2014  on  SCA1.  He  also  admitted  that  he  deliberately  failed  to  disclose  his
failure  to file federal and  state  income  tax  returns for tax  years  2013  through  2016 on
SCA2. His failure to disclose his unfiled 2012 state income tax return on SCA2 was not
alleged  in  the  SOR.  While  he  accepted  responsibility  for  his  “reporting  failures,”  he
argued  that  his  exemplary  work  record  of  20  years  and  record  of  complying  with
program  security  guidelines
into
consideration. The facts surrounding the deliberate falsifications alleged in the SOR of
SCA1 included tax year 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.c) and of SCA2 included tax year 2017 (SOR ¶
1.d). Given the dates that the respective SCAs were certified, tax years 2015 and 2017
would  not  have  been  reportable.  Thus,  I  have  not  considered  those  dates  in  the
respective SOR allegations and answers. (Item 3)
