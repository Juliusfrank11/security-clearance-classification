In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  52-year-old  security  specialist  employed  by  defense  contractors
since December 2017. He graduated from high school in June 1985. He served on active
duty in the U.S. Air Force from August 1985 to March 1991 and received an honorable
discharge. He married in February 1998, divorced in October 2009, married in September
2016, and divorced in May 2018. He has two children, ages 19 and 24. He attended a
university  from  September  2003  to  March  2005  but  did  not  receive  a  degree.  He  first
received a security clearance while in the Air Force in 1986 and again in September 2009
as an employee of a defense contractor.
Applicant worked for defense contractors as a police advisor in Iraq from May 2007
to January 2009 and as a law enforcement professional in Afghanistan from March 2009
to October 2012. He was unemployed from October 2012 to December 2013. He was a
county police officer from December 2013 to May 2014 and then moved to another state
and  was  unemployed  for  three  months.  He  worked  in  the  private  sector  as  a  field
technician from August 2014 to January 2016. He relocated to another state again and
was  unemployed  from  January  to  March  2016.  He  worked  in  the  private  sector  as  a
security officer from March 2016 to January 2017, when his company lost its contract. He
was unemployed from January to March 2017. He was employed as a commercial driver
from  May  to  October  2017,  relocated  again,  and  was  unemployed  from  October  to
December  2017,  when  he  was  hired  by  a  defense  contractor.  When  that  employer’s
contract expired in January 2019, he was immediately hired for his current job.
The SOR alleges ten delinquent debts totaling about $35,714, which are reflected
in credit reports from March and December 2019. (FORM Items 5 and 6.) He admitted all
the debts in his answer to the SOR. The evidence concerning these debts is summarized
below.
SOR  ¶  1.a:  credit-card  account  referred  for  collection  of  $9,700.  Applicant
used this credit card to purchase a timeshare.
SOR  ¶  1.b:  credit-card  account  charged  off  for  $5,568.  Applicant  used  this
credit card for daily living expenses.
SOR ¶ 1.c: collection account for $9,123. In the April 2019 PSI, Applicant was
unable to provide any information about this account. The December 2019 credit report
reflects that it is an educational debt. (FORM Item 6 at 1.) It became delinquent in May
2017 and was referred for collection in September 2017.
SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.g: collection accounts on behalf of the same original creditor
for  $3,004;  $2,730;  $2,204;  and $1,763.  Applicant  has  provided  no  information  about
these accounts.
SOR ¶ 1.h: telecommunications account referred for collection of $681. This
debt was referred for collection in June 2016.
SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j: debts of $216 and $185 to an insurance company. Applicant
switched  insurance  companies  before  paying  the  full  premium  to  the  first  insurance
company. The debts are for unpaid premiums.
Applicant provided no evidence of contacts with his creditors, payments, payment
plans, disputes, or other resolution of the debts. In his answer to the SOR, he attributed
his delinquent debts to his divorce in 2009 and a substantial loss of income. He did not
provide any further details. He did not provide any information about the circumstances
of his multiple moves from one state to another. He did not provide any information about
his current financial status.
