Applicant  is  53  years  old.  She  is  married,  and  has  a  21  year  old  son  by  a
previous marriage. (Item 3 at pages 7, 26~27 and 30.) As Department Counsel correctly
notes,  Applicant  attributes  her  financial  difficulties  to  a  2011  divorce,  two  periods  of
unemployment: from May 2014~March 2015 and again from January 2018~May 2018,
the death of her former spouse in 2013 thus ending child support, and the death of her
brother in 2017. (FORM at page 2.)
1.a.  Applicant  admits  that  she  is  indebted  to  Creditor  A  as  the  result  of  an
automobile  repossession,  but  disputes  the  $12,500  amount.  In  support  of  her  dispute
she  offers a  February 2020  credit  report with  a  pen  and  ink  notation:  “offer settlement
for  5K,”  and  nothing  more.  (Response  at  page  18.)  Without  more,  this  does  not
establish  a  good-faith  effort  to  address  this  rather  significant  debt.  This  allegation  is
found against Applicant.
1.b   and   1.c.   Applicant  denies  that  she  is  indebted  to  Creditor  B  for  past-due
debts  totaling  about  $1,326.  As  these  debts  do  not  appear  on  Applicant’s  2020  credit
reports (Response), these allegations are found for Applicant.
1.d.~1.k.  Applicant  admits  that  she  was  indebted  to  the  U.S.  Department  of
Education as the result of eight college loans totaling about $16,138. In her Response,
Applicant  submitted  documentation  showing  she  is  now in  good  standing  vis-à-vis  the
student  loans.  (Response  at  pages  2~3,  and  8~12.)  These  allegations  are  found  for
Applicant.
1.l.  Applicant denies that she is indebted to Creditor L for an alleged $244 past-
due debt. As this debt does not appear on Applicants 2020 credit reports (Response),
this allegation is found for Applicant.
