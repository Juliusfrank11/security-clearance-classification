Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, with explanations, and his admissions are
incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I
make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working at
his present job in September 2017. Aside from two months of unemployment from July to
September  of  2017,  he  has  worked  for  defense  contractors  since  1996.  He  holds  a
master’s degree earned in 1990. He is divorced (married in 1987, divorced in 2017) and
has two adult children. He has held a security clearance since 2002. (GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  had  three  delinquent  credit  card  debts  including  a
collection debt of $26,514 (SOR ¶ 1.a); a charged-off debt of $2,270 (SOR ¶ 1.b); and a
collection debt of $21,118 (SOR ¶ 1.c). The debts were listed in credit reports from April
2018 and April 2019. (GE 2-3)
Applicant credibly explained that his financial difficulties began when his then-wife
lost her job in 2015 and remained unemployed for approximately 18 months. He further
testified that he paid for the college education of both of his children and he is currently
providing $400 monthly to his son to help fund his graduate studies. Applicant testified
that his divorce in 2017 also impacted his finances. He paid his ex-wife a settlement lump
sum of  approximately  $200,000, from his retirement  account,  and pays  her alimony  of
$400 monthly. (Tr. at 24, 30-32, 35; Answer)
Applicant documented that he earns approximately $168,000 per year from his job;
that his retirement account’s balance is approximately $320,000; and that he is current
on his home mortgage payments. He also pointed out that he is current on the student
loan payments he took out to assist his son with his undergraduate payments and that he
owns a second home worth approximately $130,000 with no mortgage obligation. (Tr. at
35, 39-40; Answer)
The status of his delinquent debts is as follows:
Credit  Card  Debt-$26,514  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  Applicant  credibly  explained  that  he
became delinquent on this account when his ex-wife was unemployed. He attempted to
negotiate a lower payment and interest rate, but was told by the creditor the only way to
do so was to stop making payments. He did so, which resulted in the delinquency. He
documented that he reached a settlement with the creditor in August 2020 and paid the
agreed  upon  settlement  amount  of  approximately  $19,700  in  September  2020  (the
documentation  showed  his  written  check  to  the  creditor,  but  not  the  completed
transaction. I infer that the check process was completed). This debt is resolved. (Tr. at
24-26, 37-38; AE B, E)
Credit  Card  Debt-$2,270  (SOR  ¶  1.b).  Applicant  credibly  explained  that  he
became delinquent on this account when his ex-wife was unemployed. He attempted to
negotiate a lower payment and interest rate, but was told by the creditor the only way to
do so was to stop making payments. He did so, which resulted in the delinquency. He
documented that he reached a settlement with the creditor in August 2020 and paid the
agreed  upon  settlement  amount  of  approximately  $1,795  in  August  2020  (the
documentation  showed  his  written  check  to  the  creditor,  but  not  the  completed
transaction. I infer that the check process was completed). This debt is resolved. (Tr. at
27-28; AE C-D)
Credit  Card  Debt-$21,118  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  Applicant  credibly  explained  that  he
became delinquent on this account when his ex-wife was unemployed. He attempted to
negotiate a lower payment and interest rate, but was told by the creditor the only way to
do so was to stop making payments. He did so, which resulted in the delinquency. He
documented  that  he  reached  a  settlement  with  the  creditor  in  July  2018  and  paid  the
agreed  upon  settlement  amount  of  approximately  $16,000  in  July  2018.  This  debt  is
resolved. (Tr. at 35-36; AE A; Answer)
