In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with very brief comments, all of
the  SOR  allegations  pertaining  to  financial  considerations  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  through  1.g.).
Applicant’s admissions and his comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and
thorough  review  of  the  evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon due  consideration of  same, I
make the following findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  admin  support  with  his  current  employer  since  October  2014.  A  2005  high  school
graduate, he earned credits from a college but no degree. He served in various capacities
with the U.S. military after enlisting in the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) in November 2007.
He  served  on  active  duty  until  November  2011,  when  he  transitioned  into  the  USMC
Inactive  Reserve.  In  April  2013,  he  entered  the  U.S.  Army  Active  Reserve,  and  he
remained there until May 2015, when he again returned to the USMC Inactive Reserve.
He  remained  with  the  USMC  Inactive  Reserve  until  September  2015,  when  he  was
honorably  discharged.  He  was  granted a  secret  clearance  in 2009.  He  was married  in
2010, and he has two children, born in 2010 and 2012, as well as a stepchild, born in
2008.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can  be  found  in  the  following  exhibits:  Item  5  (Combined  Experian,  TransUnion,  and
Equifax Credit Report, dated  February 16, 2019); Item 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated
August  6,  2019);  Item  3  (SF  86,  dated  January  30,  2019);  Item  6  (Enhanced  Subject
Interview,  dated  March  12,  2019);  and  Item  2  (Applicant’s  Answers  to  SOR,  dated
October 11, 2019).
Applicant reported that he was unemployed from November 2011, when he was
honorably discharged from active duty, until April 2012; from September 2012, when he
voluntarily quit a job, until May 2013; and from May 2014, when he voluntarily quit another
job, until June 2014. He attributed his financial problems to a variety of factors: he lived
above his means for an unspecified period; he went through periods of unemployment;
his  wife  was  not  earning  enough;  and  there  were  unspecified  issues  with  the  U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) involving an overpayment, the “garnishment” of his
federal and state income tax refunds totaling approximately $10,000, and a successful
appeal by him, followed by a delay in refunding those funds to him. (Item 6, at 4; Item 3,
at 44) Applicant failed to submit any documents to support the issues raised regarding
the VA.
In  his  January  2019  SF  86,  Applicant  listed  four  delinquent  accounts,  including
three  apartment  leases,  two  of  which  he  claimed  had  already  been  resolved,  and  a
repossessed automobile. He acknowledged that he had not taken any action to resolve
the other lease or the automobile loan, but he intended to do so. (Item 3, at 44-47)
In  March  2019,  during  an  interview  with  an  investigator  from  the  U.S.  Office  of
Personnel  Management  (OPM),  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  had  several  other
delinquent  accounts.  He  claimed  that,  until  the  time  of  the  interview,  his  options  for
rectifying his financial situation had been limited, but with steady job, he was not seeking
counseling  or credit  consolidation  services  to  solve his financial  issues.  He  stated  that
once he receives his tax refund, he would start rectifying some of his delinquent accounts.
The  OPM  investigator  offered  Applicant  the  opportunity  to  furnish  documentation
regarding his delinquent accounts, but he failed to do so during or even after the interview.
(Item 6, at 4)
The SOR alleged seven delinquent accounts totaling approximately $15,147, as
set forth as follows: SOR ¶ 1.a. is a jointly-held automobile loan on a vehicle that was
repossessed, leaving a past-due balance of $2,026 that was placed for collection (Item
5, at 6); SOR ¶ 1.b. is an individual automobile loan with a past-due and unpaid balance
of $8,651 that was placed for collection (Item 5, at 6); SOR ¶ 1.c. is a wireless-telephone
account with an unpaid balance of $2,035 that first became delinquent in 2015 and was
eventually  sold  to  a  debt  purchaser  (Item  5,  at  6;  Item  4,  at  1-2);  SOR  ¶  1.d.  is  an
unspecified type of account with a federal department with an unpaid balance of $833
that was charged off (Item 5, at 7; Item 4, at 2); SOR ¶ 1.e. is a medical account with an
unpaid balance of $1,125 that was placed for collection in 2018 (Item 5, at 9); SOR ¶ 1.f.
is a cable-television account with an unpaid balance of $293 that was placed for collection
in 2018 (Item 5, at 9); and SOR ¶ 1.g. is a fitness center or gymnasium account with an
unpaid balance of $184 that was placed for collection in 2019 (Item 5, at 9).
.
Other  than  Applicant’s  promised  intentions  to  start  resolving  his  delinquent
accounts, he failed to offer any evidence, oral or documentary, of any such efforts. He did
not state that he had commenced negotiations with any of his creditors, or that he had
started making  payments  to any  of  his creditors. There  is still  no evidence  of financial
counseling. In November 2019, Department Counsel noted in the FORM that Applicant
had not provided any documentation to support his contentions in his Answer to the SOR,
essentially  that  he  would  satisfy  his  delinquent  debts  in  the  near  future.  Despite  that
notice,  Applicant  failed  to  furnish  any  material  documentation.  In  the  absence  of  such
documentation, I conclude that Applicant’s delinquent accounts have not yet entered the
process of being resolved.
Despite  Applicant’s  contention  in  March  2019  that  his  overall  financial  situation
was sufficient to not seek financial counseling or credit consolidation, it is not known what
Applicant’s current financial resources may be because he did not report his current net
monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder that might be available
for  discretionary  spending  or  savings.  There  is  no  evidence  of  a  budget.  There  is  no
evidence  of  financial  counseling.  In  the  absence  of  additional  financial  information,  it
remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than
he had been.
