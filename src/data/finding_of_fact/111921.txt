In  his  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted,  with  brief  comments,  all  of  the
SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.o.), and he
denied  all of  the SOR  allegations pertaining  to foreign  influence  (SOR  ¶¶ 2.a.  through
2.c.). Applicant’s admissions and his comments are incorporated herein. As a result of
the  evidence  furnished  with  respect  to  the  allegations  related  to  foreign  influence,  the
Government  withdrew  SOR  allegations  2.a.  through  2.c., and  those  allegations  are  no
longer an issue. (FORM, at 1) After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in
the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
in several positions of increased importance with his current employer since September
2014, and he now supervises a staff of 18 individuals. According to his Agency Director,
Applicant  is  a  “mission  critical”  employee  providing  “essential”  federal  government
services. (Attachment 5, dated March 23, 2020, to Response to the FORM) He previously
served as a doorman from May 2011 until February 2014, and he was unemployed from
February 2014 until September 2014. He received a bachelor’s degree in 2011. He has
never served in the U.S. military. He is unsure if he had been granted a security clearance
when he took his current job. He has never been married.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can be found in the following exhibits:  Item 3 (SF 86, dated January 17, 2018);  Item 7
(Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated February 2, 2018);
Item 8 (Equifax Credit Report, dated  June 4, 2019); Item 6 (LexisNexis Judgment and
Lien Filings, undated); Item 2 (Applicant’s Answers to the SOR, dated October 11, 2019),
2018); and Applicant’s Responses to the FORM, dated April 17, 2020, with attachments).
In addition to his period of unemployment, Applicant reported that he had a 2012
bankruptcy  discharge under Chapter 7 of  the  U.S. Bankruptcy  Code.  He  attributed  his
financial  problems  to  the  following  factors:  he  was  young  and  not  mature  enough  to
handle his personal finances back then, that he could not handle his finances while in
college, and that he did not know how to handle his finances when he was in his 20s.
(Item 2, at 1; Item 3, at 35; Response to the FORM, at 1-2) He acknowledged making
mistakes in the past, but contends that he has learned from his mistakes and is now a
different person. He now has a budget as well as a plan to resolve his delinquent debts.
(Response to the FORM, at 1)
In  addition  to  the  2012  bankruptcy,  the  SOR  alleged  14  delinquent  accounts
totaling approximately $66,905, with one delinquent credit-card account in the amount of
$2,867,  and  the  remaining  delinquent  accounts,  totaling  $64,038,  characterized  as
student loans. The accounts can be divided into two groups: (a) those for which Applicant
contends that he had paid off; and (b) those for which Applicant contends that they are
under repayment plans and are in the process of being paid off.
In the first group, there are two delinquent accounts, set forth as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.e. is a student loan with a university that became delinquent and went to
judgment in the amount of $7,604 in 2017. (Item 7, at 6; Item 8, at 2; and Item 6) Applicant
contended that he had been making payments for “the past 2 years,” and that he reduced
the unpaid balance to $5,531. (Item 2, at 1) On October 9, 2019, he made a final payment
to the designated Court Officer in the amount of $5,351,  and on December 6, 2019, a
Warrant  to  Satisfy  Judgment  was  filed.  (Item  2,  attachments;  Response  to  the  FORM
attachments) The judgment has been resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.i.  is  a  credit-card  account  with  an  unpaid  balance  of  $2,867  that  was
placed for collection. (Item 8, at 2) The creditor and Applicant agreed to a settlement for
a reduced amount, and on October 11, 2019, Applicant made a payment in the amount
of $1,679. (Item 2, at 1; Response to the FORM, at 1; Settlement Paid Confirmation, dated
October  28,  2019,  attached  to  the  Response  to  the  FORM)  The  account  has  been
resolved.
In  the  second  group,  there  are  12  delinquent  student-loan  accounts  which
Applicant contended he  is in the process of resolving: SOR ¶ 1.b. is with a servicer of
student loans, and has an unpaid and past-due balance of $15,734 that was placed for
collection in 2017. (Item 8, at 1; Item 7, at 15)  Applicant and the creditor agreed to an
income-driven  repayment  plan,  and  in  June  2019,  three  months  before  the  SOR  was
issued,  he  made  his  initial  payment  of  over  $187.  On  a  monthly  basis  thereafter,  he
continued to make payments of at least that amount, and sometimes over $191. The most
recent verified payment occurred in April 2020. (Account History, various dates, attached
to Item 2 and Response to the FORM; Payment Confirmation, dated January 14, 2020,
attached to Response to the FORM)
As  part  of  the  federal  CARES  ACT  legislation  associated  with  the  COVID-19
pandemic passed on March 27, 2020, the loan servicer suspended payments and interest
accrual  on  all  U.S.  Department  of  Education  (DOE)  owned  loans  until  September  30,
2020. (www.navient.com/covid-19) In other words, Applicant’s student loans with the loan
servicer  are  currently  in  a  forbearance  status.  Nevertheless,  despite  the  forbearance
status, he apparently continued to voluntarily make at least one payment after it went into
effect. The account was in the process of being resolved.
The remaining defaulted student loans are currently held by the DOE, and they
are  in  the  following  amounts:  SOR  ¶  1.c.  ($7,659);  SOR  ¶  1.d.  ($4,451);  SOR  ¶  1.f.
($4,665);  SOR  ¶  1.g.  ($3,818);  SOR  ¶  1.h.  ($3,476);  SOR  ¶  1.j.  ($1,896);  SOR  ¶  1.k.
($3,329); SOR ¶ 1.l. ($3,169); SOR ¶ 1.m. ($2,309); SOR ¶ 1.n. ($1,497); and SOR ¶ 1.o.
($1,431). (Item 7, at 6-8; Item 8, at 2, 8) In October 2019, Applicant and the credit recovery
company  that  was  representing  the  DOE established  a  rehabilitation  agreement under
which it was determined that, based on his income, he was to make monthly payments in
the amount of $92. That agreement was quickly modified in November 2019 when all of
his student loans were consolidated, and he also paid an additional $118 for the remaining
loans. Commencing in December 2019, the consolidated payment of $210 was made by
automatic electronic withdrawals, and it was established that such future payments in the
same amount was authorized. According to the credit recovery company, Applicant had
a principal balance of $35,556; interest in the amount of $7,129; and a collection charge
of $7,649, totaling nearly $50,335. (Item 2, at 1; Bank Account debit, dated October 11,
2019,  attached  to  Item  2;  Letter,  dated  October  10,  2019;  and  Recurring  Payment
Confirmation, dated November 12, 2019, both attached to the Response to the FORM)
Applicant  brought  the  student  loans  out  of  a  default  status  when  he  started  his
monthly payments under the rehabilitation agreement, and although it was not developed
that the payments have been continued, the loans are in forbearance, and they are in the
process of being resolved.
With  respect  to  Applicant’s  Chapter  7  bankruptcy,  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.,  he
voluntarily  filed  for  such  bankruptcy  on  December  30,  2011.  He  also  completed  credit
counseling that same day and received a certificate. He listed $46,573 owed to creditors
holding unsecured priority claims, essentially student loans; as well a $20,036 owed to
creditors holding unsecured claims, essentially consumer loans and credit-card balances,
but also including the creditor alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e. The total of liabilities ($66,609) was,
according to the Bankruptcy Trustee, scheduled to be discharged. An Order was issued
on April 5, 2012, discharging the debtor. (Items 4 and 5 (Extracts of the bankruptcy file,
various dates)) While student loans are not normally discharged without convincing the
bankruptcy  judge  of  certain  factors,  in  this  instance,  the  loan  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.e.  is
described in the bankruptcy petition as an unsecured nonpriority claim on an installment
account, turned into a judgment, and it appears that it was discharged by the bankruptcy
judge, as well as paid off by Applicant.
Despite Applicant’s contention that he has changed his financial outlook and ways
since he matured into his 30s, it is not known what his current financial resources may be
because he did not report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any
monthly  remainder  that  might  be  available  for  discretionary  spending  or  savings.
However, considering his successful efforts to resolve two debts, and his rehabilitation of
his now-consolidated student loans from a default status to a forbearance status, there
appears to be reduced financial pressure on him, and with his continued employment, he
seems to be on the path to eventual financial recovery.  There is evidence of a budget.
There is evidence of financial counseling in 2011.
