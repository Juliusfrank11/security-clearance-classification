After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant’s Answer to the SOR (Item 2),
I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 32 years old. She married in May 2011 and has a five-year-old daughter,
who was born in December 2014. Applicant attended a community college from August
2006 to May 2008 and a state university from January 2009 to May 2013. She has yet to
earn a college degree. (Items 3, 7.) She paid for her college classes in part with seven
federal student loans obtained for $36,870 between September 2009 and September 2012.
(Item 6.)
While  attending  college,  Applicant  worked  at  a  regional  medical  center  from
February 2007 to March 2011; was unemployed and supported by her husband from March
2011 to June 2011; worked at a pet store from June 2011 to October 2011; returned to
work for the regional hospital from October 2011 to January 2013; and was employed by a
different  medical  facility  from  January  2013  until  September  2013,  when  she  and  her
spouse  moved  to  another  state.  (Items  3,  7.)  No  information  is  in  the  record  about
Applicant’s income in any of these jobs.
Applicant was employed in retail in her new locale from October 2013 to February
2014,  when  she  began  working  for  a  defense  contractor.  On  May  26,  2015,  Applicant
completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA).  In
response  to  inquiries  concerning  any  financial  delinquency  involving  routine  accounts,
Applicant  listed  as  outstanding  debts  a  $245  collection  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.f)  that  she  had
recently learned was on her credit report, and federal student loans totaling $36,800 (SOR
¶¶ 1.a-1.e). Applicant explained about her defaulted student loans that her income was
insufficient to make monthly payments when the loans first came due in 2013; that “life
changes happened;” and that she did not have the money to make payments. Applicant
indicated that she would pay the collection debt by June 2015 and that she would start
making monthly payments toward her student-loan debts. (Item 3.) She did not specify
when she would start repayment of her student loans.
As of June 4, 2015, Applicant owed past-due balances totaling $45,780 on seven
past-due federal student- loan accounts, which reportedly had been inactive since March
2014. She was 90 days past due on an automobile loan obtained for $8,240 in February
2010 (not alleged), but a joint car loan obtained in March 2014 for $34,206 was being
repaid on time at $618 per month. The $245 was a medical debt from August 2013 in
collection since January 2015. (Item 6.)
On June 12, 2015, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  When  asked  about  her  financial  situation,
Applicant explained that she fell behind on her student loans after she had her daughter
and was unable to work. She added that the loan servicer was not willing to work with her
on lowering her monthly payments because of her spouse’s income. She lacked recall of
the specifics of the seven student loans. She did not recognize the $245 medical debt but
indicated  that  she  would  contact  the  collection  entity  holding  the  debt  to  arrange  for
repayment. Applicant was confronted about other debts on her credit report, which had
been settled, and about her delinquent car loan. She explained that she fell behind while on
maternity  leave,  and  that  she was  working to  get  caught  up on the  account.  Applicant
denied any intention of becoming delinquent on any accounts in the future. She attributed
her  financial  problems  to  moving  several  times,  changing  jobs,  and  having  a  child.
Applicant reported changes of address in June 2014, November 2014, and June 2015.
(Item 7.) No information was provided about her and her spouse’s rent at any of these
apartments.
In September 2017, a creditor obtained a $3,008 judgment against Applicant (SOR ¶
1.h). (Item 4.) Available information does not indicate when the debt became seriously
delinquent.  Her joint car loan for $34,206 was paid off according to terms in July 2018. In
February 2019, Applicant satisfied the judgment debt in SOR ¶ 1.h. (Item 2.) It is unclear
whether she made installment payments; paid a lump sum; or her wages were garnished to
repay the judgment.  In June 2019, Applicant paid off the smaller car loan that had been 90
days delinquent in 2015. (Item 4.)
As of July 2019, Equifax was reporting outstanding delinquency totaling $51,817 on
five  of  Applicant’s  student-loan  accounts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.e).  Two smaller  student  loans
totaling $2,447 as of June 2015 were no longer on her credit report, although there is no
evidence they had been paid. Applicant had not paid her $245 medical debt in collection
(SOR ¶ 1.f). Additionally, a $165 medical debt from January 2018 was in collection (SOR ¶
1.g). Applicant had no other past-due debts on her credit record. She was making timely
payments on a credit card with a $1,472 balance. (Item 5.)
On September 5, 2019, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant because of her
past-due federal student loans totaling $51,817 and her two medical collection debts on her
credit record as of June 2019. Available address information for Applicant from financial
statements shows that sometime between July 2019 and October 2019, Applicant had
moved to another state. (Item 2.) She began working at a plant involved in the destruction
of chemical agents, and was being sponsored for a public trust position. (FORM Receipt.)
On September 27, 2019, the entity collecting Applicant’s defaulted federal student
loans billed her for an accrued balance of $65,394. Applicant entered into a repayment plan
to pay $366 per month on the federal student loans. She authorized automatic payments
from her bank account to start on October 4, 2019. On October 7, 2019, Applicant paid
$245 in full satisfaction of the medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.f. As of October 9, 2019, she had
authorized a $182 debit payment from her bank account to satisfy the medical debt in SOR
¶ 1.g.  When Applicant responded to the SOR on October 10, 2019, Applicant provided
evidence of her payment arrangement for her student loans and documentation showing
she resolved her other debts. (Item 2.) She provided no information about her financial
situation, such as her current income and expenses; about the circumstances that led her
to delay resolving her past-due accounts; or about any financial counseling.
In  the  Government’s  November  13,  2019  FORM,  which  Applicant  received  on
December  4,  2019,  she  was  advised  that  she  had  the  burden  to  establish  mitigation,
including to address concerns about whether she voluntarily repaid the judgment debt,
whether she has made monthly payments on her student loans, and whether her financial
situation is currently under control. There is no indication that Applicant filed a response to
the FORM.
