The  SOR alleges  Applicant  owes  approximately  $36,000  in  delinquent  debt. He
admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  Applicant  testified  that  his  debts  arose  from  bad
choices, travel expenses, and his spouse’s spending.
SOR ¶ 1.a is a loan on a vehicle that was voluntarily repossessed. He received a
collection notice prior to the hearing, but no contact with the creditor has been made. The
debt remains unresolved. SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c are delinquent vehicle loans. Applicant was
not aware of when the loans became delinquent and their current status. He has had no
contact with the creditors and the debts remain unresolved. SOR ¶ 1.d is a delinquent
personal loan that Applicant thought was paid. However, he has not had contact with the
creditor, nor does he know its current status. The debt remains unresolved.
SOR  ¶¶  1.e  through  1.m  include  delinquent  credit  cards,  utility  debts,  personal
loans, and medical debts that remain unresolved. Applicant has not made contact with
creditors to inquire into the current status of the debts or attempt to resolve them.
Applicant  was  laid  off  in  1998,  and  remained  underemployed  until  2010.  He  is
currently paying his ex-spouse’s car loan and insurance because she cannot afford it. He
believes  that  since  his  last  divorce,  he  is  able  to  start  saving  about  $1,000  per  month
because he is moving to a lower-cost home. He has about $1,025 in his bank accounts,
and $700 in a 401K retirement savings program. He has not pursued financial counseling
or assistance with debt management.
