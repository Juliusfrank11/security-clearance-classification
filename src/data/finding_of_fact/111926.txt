Applicant is a 44-year-old quality assurance supervisor for a defense contractor,
employed since September 2017. He honorably served on active duty in the United States
Air Force from 1995 to 2015, when he retired. He was a full-time student from 2015 to
2017. He received two associate’s degrees in 2012, and a bachelor’s degree in 2018. He
married and divorced three times; from 1995 to 1999; 2006 to 2010; and 2014 to 2018.
He has three children, ages 24, 19, and 10, none of whom live with him. He held a security
clearance while on active duty.
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  owes  approximately  $46,000  in  delinquent  debts,
including  a  truck  loan,  child  support  arrearages,  credit  card,  medical,  store  credit,  and
utility debts. He admitted the child support, credit card, and store credit allegations, and
denied the car loan, medical, and phone service debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.e, and 1.f). The
Government’s exhibits support the SOR allegations.
Applicant  refinanced  his  home  in  January  2020,  and  paid  debts,  including
delinquent debts noted on his current credit report. He distributed $152,059 toward debts,
including SOR debts for child support arrearages (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c), and a credit card
(SOR  ¶  1.d).  He  used  funds  to  pay  other  debts,  including  a  portion  of  his  mortgage,
personal loan, student loan, and a credit card debt, none of which were alleged in the
SOR. He received an additional $81,000 in cash.
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a delinquent car loan. Applicant co-signed a truck loan in 2011
with his girlfriend at the time, and shortly thereafter they parted ways. His girlfriend had
the truck and was responsible to make the payments, but she defaulted after paying about
$21,000. The truck was repossessed and sold by the lender. The lender sent notifications
to  his  girlfriend  to  collect  a  deficiency  balance,  but  not  him.  Applicant  learned  of  the
defaulted loan during his security clearance interview, and tried to obtain information from
the lender, but was unsuccessful. A collection company eventually attempted to recover
the  balance  owed.  Applicant  disputed  the  debt  amount  because  it  should  have  been
reduced by the value of the truck when sold. The account was eventually removed from
his current credit report and no collection action continued.
SOR ¶ 1.e is a medical debt that was resolved in 2018. The medical company used
the wrong information when they submitted the charges to Applicant’s military retirement
medical insurance. The account is now resolved. SOR ¶ 1.f is a telephone service debt.
Applicant disputed the bill in 2013 or 2014 as incorrect after canceling the service. He
again disputed the amount owed in 2017, and with a collection company in 2020. The
debt has been removed from his current credit report. SOR ¶ 1.g is a store credit account
for furniture purchased in 2010 for a former girlfriend. She and Applicant parted ways,
and she took the furniture. She eventually defaulted on the loan. Applicant contacted the
lender in 2017 or 2018, but did not receive the requested information on the debt. The
debt has been removed from his credit report, and there are no current collection efforts.
Applicant  attributes  his  debts  to  overspending  while  on  active  duty  where  he
earned less income than he does now. He ignored some of his debts and was unaware
of others. Regardless, he did not have funds to pay them while he was a student. Once
he  was  hired  in  his  current  position  and  applied  for  a  security  clearance,  he  began  to
address  his  debts,  and  with  the  help  of  his  refinanced  home,  was  able  to  pay
delinquencies on his credit report. He has not received financial counseling. He testified
that he has bank accounts valued at about $4,000 (before receiving his refinancing cash
distribution). He earns an annual salary of about $88,000, and receives annual military
retirement  pay  and  VA  disability  pay  of  about  $35,000.  He  testified  that  he  meets  his
expenses  and  debts  with  his  current  income,  and  applies  any  excess  to  increase  his
mortgage payments in an effort to pay off his home mortgage early.
