In her response to the SOR, Applicant denied, with very brief comments, all of the
SOR  allegations  pertaining  to  financial  considerations  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  through  1.i.).
Applicant’s comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of
the evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due  consideration  of  same, I  make  the following
findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 61-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving
as a technical publications delivery specialist with her current employer since September
2018.  She  has  a  blemished  employment  history  involving  voluntary  and  involuntary
terminations separated by periods of unemployment: she had full-time employment as an
appliance manager for a major retailer from November 2006 until April 2011, when she
was  fired;  was  unemployed  from  April  2011  until  September  2011;  had  full-time
employment  as  an  assistant  branch  manager  and  eventually  branch  manager  for  a
finance  company  from  September  2011  until  April  2017,  when  she  voluntarily  quit
because of her brother’s death; was unemployed from April 2017 until September 2017;
had full-time employment as a security officer from September 2017 until November 2017,
when  she  voluntarily  quit  because  she  was  made  to  feel  old;  was  unemployed  from
December 2017 until January 2018; had full-time employment as a credit counselor from
January 2018 until April 2018, when she quit because of a “lack of leadership”; and was
self-employed as an independent contractor from May 2018 until September 2018. (Item
3, at 15-22)
A 1977 high school graduate, Applicant earned additional credits from a university
but no degree. She has never served with the U.S. military. She has never held a security
clearance. She was married in 1983, and divorced in 1987. She remarried in 2001, and
divorced in 2016. She has two adult children from her first marriage, born in 1983, and
1985.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can  be  found  in  the  following  exhibits:  Item  5  (Combined  Experian,  TransUnion,  and
Equifax Credit Report, dated April 17, 2019); Item 3 (SF 86, dated April 3, 2019); Item 4
(Enhanced Subject Interview, dated June 7, 2018); Item 2 (Applicant’s Answer to SOR,
dated November 4, 2019); and Applicant’s Response to the  FORM, dated February 4,
2020, with relevant attachments).
Applicant  reported  her  periods  of  unemployment,  but  she  did  not  specifically
include them as factors that led to her financial problems. Instead, she attributed those
problems  to  the  following  factors:  her  creditors  kept  increasing  her  credit  limits  on  her
accounts that had been open for over ten years; because she was unable to assist her
children with the costs of their education, she opened some accounts to assist them with
the purchase of their homes; for most of her life she worked in jobs that did not pay “great,”
but gave her the flexibility to put her children first; she became overconfident as to her
financial abilities; her brother passed away in January 2017; because her brother left no
last will and testament, she was named the administrator of his estate, requiring flexibility
to handle the varied requirements of being an administrator; as the estate administrator,
she engaged in a two-year legal battle with her brother’s fiancée; and Applicant quit her
job  and  cashed  in  her  401k  to  spend  significant  time  to  perform  her  duties  as
administrator.    (Response  to  the  FORM)  Another  possible  factor  was  that  at  one
unspecified  point,  her  ex-husband,  the  father  of  her  two  children,  had  child-support
arrearages of over $200,000, and his social security was garnished. (Item 3, at 25) It is
unclear if those arrearages have been resolved.
In her SF 86, Applicant acknowledged having four delinquent accounts. (Item 3 at
46-52) She also acknowledged that she had taken “several” Caribbean cruises, but only
identified one such cruise from 2015. (Item 3, at 35-41) When she was interviewed by an
investigator  with  the  U.S.  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  on  May  2,  2019,
Applicant initially contended that all of her accounts were paid in full and current. She was
confronted with a number of delinquent accounts, and claimed to be unaware that several
of  those  identified  were  her  accounts  or  that  several  of  the  other  accounts  were
delinquent.  She  discussed  various  accounts,  and  she  denied  having  more  than  one
account  with  one  particular  creditor,  although  three  separate  accounts  were  revealed.
She  later  acknowledged  that  after  her  brother  passed  away,  she  stopped  making
payments  on  all  accounts  but  for  her  car  and  a  bed.  She  admitted  that  she  willingly
“prioritized her family” – over her bills. She felt that it was a one-time situation, and that
she  got  overwhelmed  when  everything  got  out  of  control.  She  claimed  that  she  was
working on paying off her debt. She promised to resolve her debts if she is satisfied that
they are her debts and she has the means to pay them. When given the opportunity to
furnish the investigator with documents associated with her financial debts, she indicated
that she had no such documents. (Item 4, at 4)
In November 2016, Applicant made an initial contact with a law firm to discuss the
possibility of filing for bankruptcy. No other contacts were made until October 1, 2019 –
one  month  after  the  SOR  was  issued.  (Letter,  dated  January  27,  2020,  attached  to
Applicant’s Response to the FORM) On November 4, 2019, Applicant filed a petition for
bankruptcy  under  Chapter  7  of  the  U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code,  listing  $50,765  in  debts.
Although the bankruptcy trustee report had been filed in December 2019, no decision by
the bankruptcy judge regarding discharge of any debts had been made by the time the
record closed. (Item 6 (Bankruptcy History))
The  SOR  alleged  nine  delinquent  accounts  totaling  approximately  $29,338,  set
forth as follows: SOR ¶ 1.a. is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $7,501 that
was placed for collection and charged off in April 2017 (Item 5, at 6; Item 4, at 4). SOR ¶
1.b. is an unsecured loan with an unpaid balance of $4,054 that was placed for collection
and charged off in April 2017. The unpaid balance increased to $4,488 as of July 2018.
(Item 5, at 6; Item 4, at 4; Letter, dated July 30, 2018, attached to Applicant’s Response
to the FORM). SOR ¶ 1.c. is a credit-card account with a past due and unpaid balance of
$3,315 that was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser. (Item 5, at 6; Item 4,
at 1; Item 3, at 47-48) SOR ¶ 1.d. is an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance
of $2,619 that was placed for collection and charged off in May 2017. The unpaid balance
increased to $3,089 as of July 2018. (Item 5, at 7; Item 4, at 4; Letter, dated July 30, 2018,
attached to Applicant’s Response to the FORM) SOR ¶ 1.e. is a credit-card account with
a past due and unpaid balance of $3,188. (Item 5, at 7; Item 4, at 4) SOR ¶ 1.f. is a credit-
card account with a past due and unpaid balance of $2,149 that was placed for collection.
(Item 5, at 7; Item 4, at 4) SOR ¶ 1.g. is a charge account with an unpaid balance of $325
that was placed for collection and charged off in May 2017. (Item 5, at 7; Item 4, at 1-2;
Item 3, at 49-50) SOR ¶ 1.h. is a cable account for which equipment was not returned
leaving an unpaid balance of $187 that was placed for collection. (Item 5, at 11; Item 4,
at 2, 4; Item 3, at 50) SOR ¶ 1.i. is an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance
of approximately $6,000. (Item 3, at 48-49; Item 4, at 1) Although Applicant contends that
her financial problems started in January 2017, a review of her credit report reveals that
her delinquent accounts started experiencing late or non-payments as early as October-
November 2016.
Other than Applicant’s 2016 initial contact with her bankruptcy attorney, and her
July 2018 inquiry of a creditor as to the status of three of her delinquent accounts, which
have  been  confirmed  by  documents,  she  has  offered  only  unverified  contentions
regarding  her  efforts  to  resolve  the  remaining  delinquent  accounts,  for  there  is  no
documentary  evidence,  such  as  repayment  plans,  cancelled  checks,  bank  account
registers, receipts from creditors, or other material correspondence between her and her
creditors  to  support  her  positions.  On  November  4,  2019,  she  denied  that  all  of  the
accounts alleged in the SOR remained delinquent. That denial was false, for while she
may have filed her petition for bankruptcy on that date, the simple filing of a bankruptcy
petition does not automatically eliminate the standing account delinquencies.
It is not known what Applicant’s current financial resources may be because she
did  not  report  her  current  net  monthly  income;  monthly  expenses;  and  any  monthly
remainder  that  might  be  available  for  discretionary  spending  or  savings.  There  is  no
evidence of a budget. There is evidence of financial counseling associated with the filing
for  bankruptcy.  In  the  absence  of  additional  financial  information,  it  remains  difficult  to
determine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than she had been, or if
her focus on her family’s financial desires are still given priority over her own finances.
