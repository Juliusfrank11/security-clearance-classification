Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations, with explanations. His admissions are
incorporated  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence,  I  make
the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  29-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  has  worked  for
this  employer  for  approximately  two  years.  He  is  a  high  school  graduate  and  has
completed  some  college  courses.  He  is  single  and  has  no  children.  He  served  in  the
U.S. Air National Guard from 2009 to 2014 and was honorably discharged. (Items 3-4)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  accumulated  seven  collection  and  five  charged-off
debts totaling approximately $24,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.l). The allegations are supported by
his  statements  to  a  defense  investigator  during  his  background  investigation  in  June
2018,  credit  reports  from  August  2017  and  January  2019,  and  admissions in  his  SOR
answer. (Items 2, 4-6)
Applicant  attributed  his  delinquent  debts  to  his  life  becoming  difficult  without
further explanation. After receiving the SOR, Applicant engaged a debt relief company
(DRC)  to  settle  eight  of  his  SOR  debts.  Four  SOR  debts  totaling  $1,336  were  not
addressed  by  the  DRC  and  Applicant  provided  no  further  information  on  their  status.
Under his DRC plan, Applicant began making $147.50 bi-weekly payments to the DRC
in November 2019. Applicant provided documentation from the DRC showing that as of
January  20,  2020,  he  had  a  balance  of  $555  in  his  DRC  account  and  two  debts  had
been settled, although the specific settled debts are not identified in the documentation.
(Item 2; AE A-C)
Applicant  prepared  an  income  and  expense  statement  for  the  DRC,  which
showed that he has a monthly income of approximately $3,600, with monthly expenses
of  approximately  $3,270, leaving  a  net  monthly remainder  of  $330.  He  did not  provide
any  evidence that  he  sought  financial  counseling,  other  than  engaging  the  DRC. (Item
2; AE A-C)
