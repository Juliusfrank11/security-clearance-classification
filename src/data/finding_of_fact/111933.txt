In  his  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted,  with  brief  comments,  all  of  the
SOR allegations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c.). Applicant’s admissions and accompanying
comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence
in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  a  computer  operator  with  his  current  employer  since  June  2018.  He  had  previous
experience as a quality control inspector (July 2015 until July 2017), and as a drilling fluids
specialist (May 2012 until February 2015). He is a 1989 high school graduate. He enlisted
in the U.S. Navy in April 1992, and served on active duty until he was honorably retired
as a petty officer first class (E-6) in May 2012.  He was granted a secret clearance in July
1992. He was married in 1996, and divorced in 2008. He has no children.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can  be  found  in  the  following  exhibits:  Item  6  (Combined  Experian,  TransUnion,  and
Equifax Credit Report, dated August 4, 2018); Item 7 (Equifax Credit Report, dated May
13, 2019); Item 8 (Equifax Credit Report, dated December 18, 2019); Item 4 (SF 86, dated
June 3, 2018); Item 5 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated February 28, 2019); and Item
3 (Applicant’s Answers to SOR, dated November 12, 2019).
Applicant reported that he was unemployed due to layoffs on two occasions: from
February 2012 until February 2015, and from July 2017 until June 2018. (Item 4, at 13-
14) As a result of the cumulative effect of his layoffs, he underwent periods of financial
strain and got behind on his bills. Several accounts became delinquent, and although he
attempted  to  resolve  issues  with  his  home  mortgage,  the  house  was  eventually
foreclosed.
In his June 2018 SF 86, Applicant candidly listed having five delinquent accounts,
including his foreclosure, attributing them to his unemployment and resulting insufficient
funds. (Item 4, at 35-40) In February 2019, during an interview with an investigator from
the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM),  Applicant characterized his financial
situation as “improving.” He discussed four specific accounts, and he claimed that he had
been  in  contact  with  collection  agencies,  and  he  has  either  been  making  payment
arrangements  to  pay  off  his  debts,  or  he  has  been  making  monthly  payments  to  his
creditors. (Item 5, at 5) In his Answer to the SOR, he confirmed that since returning to
work,  he  had  made  arrangements  with  his  creditors,  and  that  payments  have  been
regularly made on all accounts. (Item 3, at 2)
Applicant’s May 2019 credit report reported one foreclosure and four charged-off
accounts (one of which was listed under both the original creditor and the debt purchaser),
and reflected that other accounts either were current or had zero balances. (Item 7) His
December  2019  credit  report  reported  that  Applicant  had  made  payments  to  several
accounts that had resulted in decreases of the remaining balances for several delinquent
accounts. (Item 8)
The SOR alleged three delinquent accounts totaling approximately $35,474, not
approximately $37,000 as alleged by Department Counsel, as set forth as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a. is a credit-card account with a past due and unpaid balance of $16,171
that was charged off in  the amount of $16,721. Applicant had been making payments,
with  the  most  recent  reported  $50  payment  listed  in  his  December  2019  credit  report
made in November 2019, and the unpaid balance had been reduced to $15,821. (Item 6,
at 10; Item 7, at 2; Item 8, at 2; Item 5, at 5) However, Applicant submitted two receipts
from the collection agent reflecting $50 payments made in December 2019 and January
2020, reducing the remaining balance to $15,721 as of January 24, 2020. (Letters, dated
December 23, 2019, and January 24, 2020, attached to his Response to the FORM) The
account is in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b. is another credit-card account with a past due and unpaid balance of
$16,141  that  was  charged  off  in  the  amount  of  $16,716.  Applicant  had  been  making
payments, with the most recent reported $150 payment listed in his December 2019 credit
report made in November 2019, and the unpaid balance had been reduced to $15,091.
(Item 6, at 9; Item 7, at 2; Item 8, at 2; Item 5, at 5) However, Applicant submitted two
receipts from the collection agent reflecting $150 payments made in December 2019 and
January  2020,  reducing  the  remaining  balance  to  $14,792  as  of  January  23,  2020.
(Letters, dated November 21, 2019, and January 23, 2020, attached to his Response to
the FORM) The account is in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c. is a furniture store charge account with an unpaid balance of $3,162
that was charged off and sold to a debt purchaser. Applicant had been making payments,
with  the  most  recent  reported  $51  payment  listed  in  his  December  2019  credit  report
made in December 2019, and the unpaid balance had been reduced to $2,783. (Item 6,
at 9; Item 7, at 2; Item 8, at 1; Item 5, at 5) However, Applicant submitted two receipts
from the debt purchaser reflecting $51 payments made in  January 2020 and February
2020, reducing the remaining balance to $2,733 as of January 23, 2020. (Letters, dated
January  3,  2020,  and January  22,  2020,  attached  to his Response  to  the  FORM) The
account is in the process of being resolved.
Despite Applicant’s contention in February 2019 that his overall financial situation
was  “improving,”  it  is  not  known  what  Applicant’s  current  financial  resources  may  be
because he did not report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any
monthly remainder that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is
no evidence of a budget. Although he had previously indicated that once his employment
is secured  he planned  to  seek  credit  counseling,  there  is no documentary  evidence  of
financial counseling. (Item 4) In the absence of additional financial information, it remains
difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had
been.
