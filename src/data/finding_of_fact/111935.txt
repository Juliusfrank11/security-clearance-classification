The SOR alleges financial considerations security concerns based on Applicant’s
unfiled Federal income tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2017. The SOR also alleges
four unpaid credit card accounts totaling approximately $22,500. In his Answer, Applicant
admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.e.)  After  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 56 years old. He graduated from high school in 1982. He served on
active duty in the U.S. Air Force from 1985 to 1989. He was a sergeant at the time of his
honorable  discharge.  After  his  separation,  he  was  transferred  to  the  inactive  reserve.
Applicant attended college seeking a physical therapy degree, but in 1999, he dropped
out of the last class he needed to complete a college degree. Since February 2018, he
has  been  employed  as  an  engineer  with  a  DOD  contractor.  His  annual  salary  is
approximately  $80,000.  He  has  been  married  since  1999,  and  he  has  two  daughters,
ages 17 and 14, and an eight-year-old son. His wife works full-time as a comptroller and
makes approximately $90,000 a year. (Tr. 24-29, 31-32; GE 1, GE 2)
Applicant  and  his  spouse  have  been  employed  full-time  since  2015,  making
approximately  $150,000  to  $170,000  per  year.  He  stated  that  their  financial  and  tax
problems  developed  after  their  restaurant  business  failed.  They  opened  their  first
restaurant in 2004, and later sold it in 2012. He stated this restaurant was making a little
bit of money over the years. Applicant worked other full-time employments from February
2008 through July 2011, February 2012 to July 2012, and October 2012 to April 2013,
which overlapped with his restaurant business. Applicant opened another restaurant in
2013 at an outdoor mall. Due to cold temperatures during the winter season, and other
unfavorable  weather  conditions,  the  restaurant  did  not  have  many  customers.  The
restaurant  was  occasionally  busy  on  the  weekends,  but  during  the  weekdays,  the
restaurant  had  a  very  limited  number  of  customers.  Applicant  and  his  wife  soon  used
credit cards to fund their business operation. Applicant used what little money he had to
pay  his  employees,  to  the  detriment  of  his  creditors.  After  two  years  of  losing  money,
Applicant and his wife decided to close the restaurant in 2015. (Tr. 32-36)
Financial Considerations
Applicant failed to timely file Federal income tax returns, as required, for tax years
2010 through 2017. (SOR ¶ 1.a) He stated that the unfiled Federal income tax returns
from 2010 through 2017 resulted from his wife, who was the one who usually prepared
their tax returns, being too busy with the restaurant business and children. He admitted
at the hearing that the estimated amount of Federal taxes currently owed is more than
$10,000.  Although  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  Applicant  also  did  not  timely  file  his  state
income tax returns for the same years. He estimated that he owed approximately $3,000
for delinquent state taxes.
Applicant claimed that he was not aware that their income tax returns had not been
filed for several years. Applicant and his spouse filed all of their delinquent Federal income
tax returns in September 2019. He stated it took approximately four weeks to gather the
necessary paperwork to get their tax returns filed. As of the date of the hearing, Applicant
had not reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the repayment
of  his  delinquent  Federal  taxes,  nor  had  he  reached  a  repayment  agreement  with  the
state’s  department  of  taxation.  Post-hearing  documentation  submitted  by  Applicant
showed that on March 26, 2020, he and his spouse sent FORM 12153, a Request for a
Collection Due Process or Equivalent Hearing, concerning their delinquent Federal taxes
owed  for  tax  year  2013.  (AE  E)  Although  Applicant’s  Federal  income  tax  returns  have
recently been filed, his delinquent Federal tax debt has not been resolved. (Tr. 36-41, 45;
GE 3)
Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $9,066 for a charged-off credit
card balance. (SOR ¶ 1.b) Applicant stated that he contacted the creditor in December
2019, and the creditor told him he had two options with the charged-off account:  He could
do nothing since the account is no longer in collection, or he could pay the debt. Applicant
has  not  paid  any  money  on  this  account.  His  background  interview  took  place  in
November 2018, and during the interview the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR were
discussed  with  Applicant.  During  the  hearing,  Department  Counsel  asked  why  it  took
Applicant over a year after his interview to make contact with the creditor. Applicant stated
that he did not have an answer. He stated that this creditor informed him a 1099-C will be
issued to him in April 2020. (Tr. 45-48)
Post-hearing  documentation  submitted  by  Applicant  showed  that  on  March  3,
2020, he and his spouse received a confirmation of settlement offer from the creditor. The
letter stated that the current balance was $9,067, but if a payment of $4,081 was received
no  later  than  March  3,  2021,  the  account  would  be  considered  settled.  There  was  no
evidence submitted to show that the settlement payment of $4,081 was made, therefore,
this account is unresolved. (AE F)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges that Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $7,955
for a charged-off credit card balance. Applicant reported that in approximately February
2020 a default judgment was issued against him, which at the time of the hearing, was
still unsatisfied. Applicant stated that he contacted the creditor in December 2019 in an
attempt  to  resolve  the  debt.  He  admitted  that  over  a  year  has  passed  since  his
background  interview  in  November  2018,  where  he  did  not  call,  email,  or  contact  the
creditor in any fashion to resolve this debt. (Tr. 49-50)
Post-hearing  documentation  submitted  by  Applicant  showed  that  on  March  3,
2020,  Applicant’s  bank  reported  to  the  court  that  his  account  had  $3,064  available  for
garnishment. On March 12, 2020, the creditor sent a letter of acceptance for a payment
plan with the following conditions: Balance due $8,170, and $425 paid by April 17, 2020,
and  $425  paid  monthly  thereafter  until  the  debt  is  paid  in  full.  There  was  no  evidence
submitted showing that the any payments have been made on this delinquent debt. This
account is unresolved. (AE G)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges that Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $2,440
for a charged-off credit card balance. Post-hearing documentation submitted by Applicant
showed that on February 28, 2020, the creditor offered a settlement. The settlement offer
letter  stated that the current  balance  was $2,440,  and  if  Applicant made a payment  of
$1,099 no later than February 28, 2021, the account would be considered settled. There
was no evidence submitted showing that the settlement payment of $1,099 was made to
the creditor, therefore, this account is unresolved. (Tr. 51 AE H)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges that Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $3,027
for an unpaid credit card balance referred for collection. At the hearing, Applicant provided
a document showing that the account had been settled in February 2020 after he made
a payment of $1,200. This account has been resolved. (Tr. 16-20, 51; GE 4; AE C)
Applicant  admitted  there  were  a  couple  of  more  creditors  that  have  developed
recently with outstanding balances that were not reported in the SOR. He was unable to
state with certainty the total amount of these debts since his wife handles the household
finances. Applicant and his wife both purchased new cars in 2015, the same year they
closed their restaurant after two years of poor business. Applicant estimated that the cars
will be paid off in approximately 18 months. (Tr. 52-54)
Post-hearing documentation submitted by Applicant showed that as of March 28,
2020, he and his spouse did not have sufficient income to pay their monthly expenses
and  the  monthly  settlement  payment  for  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  1.c.  His  wife  was
furloughed by her employer in mid-March 2020, due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Her
monthly unemployment income was $2,078, and after paying all of the expenses listed
on their budget, there was a deficiency balance of -$1,620 at the end of the month. (AE
