Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  28  years  old.  He  is  not  married  and  has  no  children.  He  attended
college, but did not earn a degree. He later earned a technical certificate. Applicant has
worked with his current employer, a federal contractor, since August 2017. (Item 3)
In  November  2011,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana, first offense in State A. This charge was dismissed following completion of a
drug education class, mandatory drug testing, and a probationary period. (Items 2, 3, 4,
5, 6)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  September  2018  and  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana,  a  first  offense  misdemeanor  in  State  B.  Applicant  disputed  the  September
2018 date and said it occurred in October 2018. Court documents confirm the September
2018  date.  His  charge  was  deferred,  pending  the  completion  of  a  drug-screen
assessment to determine if he needed drug counseling and the completion of three drug
tests a month apart. He was also required to complete 100 hours of community service.
He began drug testing in January 2019, completed the terms of the deferment in June
2019, and the charge was dismissed. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  on  December  20,
2018. In it, he disclosed that he used marijuana once every few days from August 2010
until October 2018, the month he said he was arrested for marijuana possession. He also
disclosed that he intended to continue using marijuana as a sleep aid and because it was
legal in the jurisdiction where he lived. (Item 3)
In March 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. During
his interview, he told the investigator that he intends to continue to use marijuana when
he goes out, but had not used it since January 2019, because, at that time, he had to
pass the three drug tests that were part of the diversion program for his 2018 marijuana
possession  arrest.  He  stated  he  would  probably  use  marijuana  after  his  probationary
period ends in June 2019, but could stop if he needed to. He stated that his family and
friends use marijuana. He said that his marijuana use has decreased over the years, and
he probably only used it three or four times during the past year. Applicant stated that he
usually  obtains  marijuana  from  individuals  in  social  settings,  typically  from  a  friend  or
cousin. (Item 6)
Applicant  answered  government  interrogatories  on  September  12,  2019.  He
disclosed  that  his  last  marijuana  use  was  December  12,  2018.  He  was  “gifted”  the
marijuana from his cousin. He indicated he did not intend to use marijuana in the future.
(Item 6).
