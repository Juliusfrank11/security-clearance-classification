In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through
1.m. (HE 3) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  31-year-old  information  technology  specialist,  and  he  has  been
employed  by  his  current  DOD  contractor  since  October  2019.  (Tr.  6,  9)  In  2006,  he
graduated from high school, and in 2013, he received a bachelor of science degree in
management communication systems. (Tr. 7) In 2016, he received a master’s degree in
computer science and information technology. (Tr. 8-9, 25) He served in the Army from

(Tr. 7-8) His highest military award is an Army Commendation Medal (ARCOM). (Tr. 8)

Financial Considerations
In  the  past  three  years,  Applicant  was  unemployed  once  and  that  was  for  two
months in 2019. (Tr. 9, 29-31) He said he was the victim of identity theft. (Tr. 24) In 2017,
he employed CRC1 to correct his credit reports. (Tr. 62, 33-35, 64-65; GE 2 at 7) He also
received some financial counseling from CRC1. (Tr. 62-63) He wanted CRC1 to arrange
consolidation of his verified debts; however, the CRC1 was too slow. (Tr. 32-33) In March
2018, he ended his employment of CRC1, and he decided that his sister-in-law was a
better choice to handle his debt resolution. (Tr. 33, 65) Based on his sister-in-law’s advice,
he  decided  to  pay  one  debt  at  a  time.  (Tr.  33-34,  66)  He  learned  about  most  of  the
delinquent debts on his SOR in 2017 when he employed CRC1 to repair his credit. (Tr.
32, 35) He has a written budget. (Tr. 67)
Applicant  provided an  agreement  with  a  different  credit  repair  company (CRC2)
dated February 11, 2020; however, the agreement was unsigned. (AE C) In return for a
flat fee of $1,200, CRC2 agreed to provide the following services: (1) assess Applicant’s
current  financial  situation;  (2)  provide  a  detailed  review  of  his  income,  assets,  and
expenses; (3) provide personalized options based on his goals, which may include social
service referrals, educational materials and resources, and a debt management plan; and
(4) assist with either a debt management plan or debt consolidation. (AE C)
Applicant did not provide any documentation to corroborate his hearing statement
that he paid any of his debts. He said he paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l, and
those three debts were removed from his most recent credit report. The other SOR debts
that he said were resolved were still listed on his most recent credit report of record.
The SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts totaling $27,598 as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant has a utility debt placed for collection for $255.
Applicant  said  he  owed  the  debt.  (Tr.  32-34)  SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  1.c,  and  1.m  allege,  and
Applicant admitted that he has three medical accounts placed for collection for $84, $212,
and $97. (Tr. 34-36, 53; HE 3)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges that Applicant has a charged-off telecommunications debt for
$848. (Tr. 28) Applicant contacted the creditor and learned the debt was sold to another
creditor, and he asked about settling the debt. (Tr. 36-37) He did not indicate the creditor
proposed a settlement amount.
SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f allege that Applicant has two debts placed for collection that
are owed to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for $875 and $286. The VA overpaid
Applicant  for  his  tuition.  (Tr.  38)  Applicant  said  the  two  debts  were  paid  when  the  VA
received his Army National Guard drill pay. (Tr. 38-39) The two debts are still shown as
delinquent  on  his  most  recent  credit  report.  He  did  not  provide  Army  National  Guard
records showing any payments to the VA.
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges that Applicant has a charged-off bank debt for $1,160. Applicant
admitted responsibility for the debt, and he said he had not made any payments to the
creditor. (Tr. 41-42) He planned to pay the debt. (Tr. 42)
SOR  ¶  1.h  alleges  that  Applicant  has  a  charged-off  debt  for  $22,330.  In  2014,
Applicant borrowed funds to enable his sister to have a vehicle, and Applicant is the only
borrower on the loan agreement. (GE 2 at 7; GE 3) His sister told Applicant that she would
pay  the  debt.  In  2016,  she  defaulted  on  the  loan,  and  in  2017,  the  vehicle  was
repossessed. (GE 2 at 7; GE 3) His August 19, 2019 credit report indicates the charged-
off  amount  was  $22,330.  (GE  3)  Applicant’s  June  27,  2018  Office  of  Personnel
Management  (OPM)  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  states  that  Applicant  planned  to
resolve the $7,000 debt with a lump-sum payment by April 2019. (GE 2 at 7) Payment
was delayed because Applicant wanted to verify that the creditor seeking payment was
actually the creditor holding the debt. (Tr. 43-46) On January 2, 2020, the creditor wrote
the outstanding balance is $14,035; the creditor offered to settle the debt for $2,105; and
Applicant  was  offered  the  option  of  making  six  $351  monthly  payments  to  resolve  the
debt. (AE A) At his hearing, Applicant said he intended to make his first payment after his
hearing on February 22, 2020. (Tr. 48, 72) Department Counsel reminded Applicant about
providing proof of the $351 payment. (AE B) However, the record closed on March 13,
2020, and he did not provide proof of the first $351 payment.
SOR  ¶  1.i  alleges  that  Applicant  has  a  charged-off  bank  card  debt  for  $913.
Applicant  admitted  responsibility  for  this  debt.  (Tr.  49;  HE  3)  SOR  ¶  1.j  alleges  that
Applicant has a store credit card placed for collection for $279. Applicant said he paid the
debt  in  2018,  and  CRC1  was  able  to  get  it  removed  from  his  credit  report.  (Tr.  50)
Applicant’s  August  19,  2019  credit  report  does  not  include  the  SOR  ¶  1.j  debt,  and
Applicant is credited with paying it. (GE 3)
SOR  ¶  1.k  alleges  that  Applicant  has  a  telecommunications  debt  placed  for
collection for $151. Applicant said he paid the debt in 2018. (GE 2) He also said the debt
was resolved when he turned in cable equipment. (Tr. 51-52) This debt does not appear
on his August 19, 2019 credit report, and Applicant is credited with resolving it. (GE 3)
SOR ¶ 1.l alleges that Applicant has an insurance debt placed for collection for
$108. Applicant said he paid the debt in 2018; he disputed his responsibility for this debt;
and it was removed from his credit report. (Tr. 52-53; GE 2; GE 3) Applicant is credited
with resolving this debt.
In addition to the SOR-alleged debts, Applicant is making payments on a state tax
debt that resulted from an error in his tax return for tax year 2014. (Tr. 54) When he began
making  payments,  he  owed  $2,200.  (Tr.  54)  Payments  are  being  taken  out  of  his
paycheck, and he currently owes $770. (Tr. 54) Applicant has student loans totaling about
$50,000 that are in deferment. (Tr. 69-70; GE 3) I asked Applicant to provide a copy of
IRS Form 1040s for the last five years, documentation showing the status of his state tax
debt, his request for deferment of his student loans, and any approval of deferment of his
student loans. (Tr. 70-73) After his hearing, Applicant provided a document showing he
was applying for an Income-Driven Repayment plan to address his student loans. (AE B)
He did not provide the previous request for deferment, and I reiterated my request for a
copy of his student loan deferral and approval. (AE D) Applicant traveled to Panama in
2017 and to Jamaica in 2018 for tourism. (Tr. 58-60; GE 2)
Applicant’s  June  27,  2018  OPM  personal  subject  interview  provided  notice  to
Applicant of the delinquent status of several accounts. (GE 2) For several of the debts,
he indicated CRC1 was resolving the debts. (GE 2) For others, he said he was unaware
of the delinquent debts. (GE 2)
Applicant  emphasized  that  he  has  been  in  the  Army  for  13  years,  and  he  is
pursuing promotion to staff sergeant. (Tr. 24) He needs a security clearance for his Army
employment and his DOD-contractor employment. (Tr. 24, 29-30) He intended to improve
his financial decisions and financial responsibility. (Tr. 24-25)
