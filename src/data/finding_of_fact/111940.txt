In his Answer, Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations except ¶ 1.f, which he
denied. He is 31 years old, single, and does not have children. (Answer; Tr. at 7, 9; GE
1)
Applicant graduated from high school in 2007. He then served in the U.S. military
from  2007  until  he  was  honorably  discharged  in  September  2015.  He  was  discharged
from the National Guard (NG) in late 2017. As of the date of the hearing, he worked as
an aircraft mechanic for his employer, a DOD contractor, since September 2018. He was
first granted a security clearance in 2008. (Tr. at 5-7, 21-25, 36-38; GE 1)
The SOR alleges five delinquent consumer accounts totaling $32,761 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a
- 1.e) and a delinquent $358 U.S. Government overpayment (SOR ¶ 1.f). The debts are
established by Applicant’s admissions and 2018 and 2019 credit reports. Applicant also
disclosed and discussed his debts in his 2018 security clearance application (SCA) and
during his 2019 background interview. (GE 1-4)
Applicant  attributed  his  delinquent  debt  to  a  period  of  self-employment  from
February to July 2016 and a period of underemployment from July 2016 to September
2018. Having worked as a truck driver from September 2015 to February 2016, he formed
an  owner-operator  business  in  which  he  was  contracted  by  a  company  to  haul
recreational vehicles (RVs) from the manufacturer to dealerships around the country. To
do  so,  he  purchased  a  business  vehicle  for  which  he  was  responsible  for  carrying
insurance, as further discussed below. He earned approximately $8,000 monthly during
this period of self-employment. (Tr. at 21-77; GE 1, 4)
In May 2016, Applicant’s anticipated two-week NG training unexpectedly lasted for
five weeks. He did not earn income from his business during this period and he did not
get paid for his NG training until September 2016. When he returned from NG training,
the company to which he was contracted did not provide him with as many RV units to
haul.  He  was  consequently  unable  to  make  the  monthly  payments  on  his  business
vehicle,  it  was  repossessed  in  around  September  2016,  and  his  business  faltered.  He
then  worked  on  an  as-needed  basis  for  $15  hourly  in  home  entertainment  installation,
and he supplemented his income as a ride share service driver. From approximately July
2017 to September 2018, he worked for a fast food restaurant in which he earned $28,000
annually  as  a  shift  leader  and  then  $40,000  annually  as  a  general  manager.  He  also
incurred  $5,000  in  out-of-pocket  expenses  for  his  cross-country  move  in  2018  for  his
current employment. (Tr. at 21-77; GE 1, 4)
SOR ¶ 1.a is for a $28,081 charged-off automobile account related to Applicant’s
purchase  of  a  business  vehicle,  as  previously  discussed.  Applicant
financed
approximately  $72,000  in  February  2016  to  purchase  an  $80,000  truck.  When  he
purchased  this  vehicle,  he  turned  in  two  other  vehicles  and  made  a  minimal  down
payment.  Within  the  cross-country  RV  hauling  community,  it  was  common  business
practice  to  purchase  a  vehicle  that  was  reliable  and  served  as  a  place  to  sleep.  His
monthly payment was $1,300. He received delinquent notifications by e-mail when he did
not  make  his  monthly  payments,  beginning  in  around  May  2016.  The  vehicle  was
repossessed  in  September  2016.  He  did  not  learn  that  his  outstanding  balance  after
repossession was $28,081 until he checked his credit report and communicated with the
creditor in early to mid-2017. As of the date of the hearing, he had not yet taken action to
resolve  this  account  because  he  lacked  the  financial  means  to  do  so.  Additionally,  he
focused  on  addressing  his  daily  living  expenses  to  ensure  he  did  not  incur  additional
delinquent debt and was paying his smaller delinquent SOR debts, as discussed below.
He intends to resolve this debt. (Tr. at 24-36, 38, 71-72, 74; GE 1, 2, 3, 4)
SOR  ¶  1.b  is  for  a  social  group  membership  account,  placed  for  collection  for
$2,635. Applicant signed paperwork for a one-year membership with the group in July
2017. He attended the group’s events and paid its monthly membership dues for three
months, after which time he stopped attending the group’s events but was still charged
for  the  remaining  dues.  He  did  not  understand  the  one-year  financial  commitment  he
made when he joined the group. He provided documentation reflecting that he paid this
account in March 2020. (Tr. at 38-41, 73-74; GE 2, 3, 4; AE A)
SOR  ¶  1.c  is  for  a  cellular  wireless  account  placed  for  collection  for  $1,077.
Applicant  believed  he  paid  this  account  before  he  switched  carriers  in  2015.  He  first
became aware that it was delinquent when he observed it on his credit report in late 2018,
at which point he telephoned the underlying creditor and was told that they did not have
a record of the account. After he received the SOR, he telephoned the collection agency
and  unsuccessfully  disputed  the  outstanding  amount.  He  began  receiving  delinquency
notices from the collection agency in February 2020. He intended to resolve this account
with his anticipated tax refund for tax year 2019. He provided documentation reflecting
that this collections account was removed from his credit bureau report between March
27 and April 2, 2020. (Tr. at 41-44, 71, 73-74; GE 2, 3, 4; AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.d is for a supermarket credit card placed for collection for $493. Applicant
used this credit card for both business and personal expenses. It became delinquent in
around July or August 2016. He provided documentation reflecting that he settled and
paid this card in March 2020. (Tr. at 44-46, 71, 74; GE 2, 3, 4; AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.e is for a credit card placed for collection for $475. Applicant could not
recall when this card first became delinquent. He provided documentation reflecting that
he settled and paid this card in March 2020. (Tr. at 46-48, 71, 74; GE 2, 3, 4; AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.f is for a U.S. Government life insurance overpayment that was placed
for collection for $358. Applicant recalled receiving a notice from the U.S. Government
between  approximately  February  and  April  2019,  indicating  that  the  overpayment  was
resolved through a garnishment of his income tax refund for tax year 2018. This debt is
only reflected in Applicant’s October 2018 credit report; it is not reflected in his most recent
credit report from June 2019. (Tr. at 48-49; GE 2, 3, 4)
Applicant has earned $70,000 annually, or a net income of $4,000 monthly, since
September 2018. His monthly rent is $600. He owns two cars, a $15,000 truck that he
financed  with  a  five-year  loan  in  July  2017,  and  a  $29,000  compact  crossover  that  he
financed with a $25,000 five-year loan in April 2019. His truck and insurance payments
were $525 and $125 monthly, respectively, and he withdrew $4,000 from his retirement
savings  account  to  pay  his  truck  loan  in  2019  so  that  he  could  have  more  disposable
income. He is current on his payments of $500 monthly for his compact crossover and
insurance of $100 monthly. He has a credit card with a $400 limit, which he uses to rebuild
his credit. He tries to set aside his estimated monthly net remainder of $600 for savings,
and had $600 in savings as of the date of the hearing. He has used a tax preparation
company to file his taxes and was current on his annual income tax filings; he also paid
the taxes associated with his $4,000 withdrawal from his retirement savings account.  He
received  financial  counseling  when  he  was  discharged  from  the  U.S.  military,  and  he
monitors his credit by checking his credit report. He does not have any other delinquent
debt. (Tr. at 21-22, 51-70, 74; GE 4)
