In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and
1.d-1.i and denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c. I have treated his admission of
SOR ¶ 1.e as a denial for the reasons set out below. His admissions in his answer are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 32-year-old technician employed by a defense contractor. He was
unemployed from December 2007 to February 2009. He served on active duty in the U.S.
Marine  Corps  from  February  2009  to  February  2013  and  received  an  honorable
discharge. He was unemployed from February 2013 to September 2015, while attending
school  and  being  financially  supported  by  the  GI  Bill.  He  was  employed  in  the  private
sector from September 2015 until he was hired by his current employer in January 2018.
He received a security clearance in July 2009, while serving in the U.S. Marine Corps.
Applicant married in July 2012 and divorced in January 2015. He has a five-year-
old child. The record does not reflect whether he is obligated to pay child support.
The  SOR  alleges  nine  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $31,977.  The  debts  are
reflected in credit reports from February 2020, August 2019, and October 2018. (FORM
Items 4, 5, and 6.) The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: car loan charged off for $4,606. This loan was for a car that Applicant
purchased  in  May  2014.  The  car  was  a  total  loss  after  an  accident  in  2016.  Applicant
believed  that  his  auto  insurance  would  pay  off  the  loan,  but  the  amount  paid  by  the
insurance company apparently was less than the balance on the loan. During the January
2019  security  interview,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  received  some  collection
attempts, but he attributed these attempts to the insurance company’s delay in paying off
the loan. (FORM Item 3 at 4.) He settled the remaining balance on the car loan for less
than the full amount in March 2020. (AX A at 1.)
SOR  ¶  1.b:  telecommunication  bill  charged  off  for  $211.  This  debt  was  for
unreturned equipment. It was charged off in April 2017. Applicant paid it in full in February
2020. (AX A at 21.)
SOR ¶ 1.c: car loan placed for collection of $4,606. This debt is a duplicate of
the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a is for the same amount to
the same creditor, and the nine-digit account number alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a is the same
as the first nine digits in the account number alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c.
SOR ¶ 1.d: installment sales contract charged off for $1,260. This account was
opened in November 2009, while Applicant was on active duty in the Marine Corps, and
the debt was charged off in June 2012. In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he stated that
this debt was settled. The October 2018 credit report reflects that the account is closed
but does not indicate that it was resolved. (FORM Item 4 at 4.) The debt is not reflected
in the August 2019 and February 2020 credit reports.
SOR ¶ 1.e: jewelry store account placed for collection of $9,934. In his answer
to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debt but contended that it was for jewelry he ordered
but never received. In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he had contacted the creditor
in an effort to settle the debt. The October 2018 credit report reflected that the debt was
disputed.  In  his  response  to  the  FORM,  he  included  a  press  release  from  the  state
attorney general announcing the conviction of the owner of the jewelry store for felony
conspiracy  to  engage  in  illegal  financing  and  debt-collection  practices  targeting  sailors
and marines. The owner of the jewelry store was sentenced to 90 days in jail and three
years of felony probation, ordered to pay restitution to victims, and required to cancel the
outstanding debts incurred by victims. (AX A at 42-44.)
SOR ¶ 1.f: collection account for $7,712. This debt was for early termination of
a lease. During his security interview in January 2019, Applicant told the investigator that
he was uncomfortable living in an apartment after he learned that a previous occupant
had died there. He requested that he be allowed to move into another apartment in the
same complex. When his request was denied, he moved out of the apartment six months
before  the  end  of  the  lease  term  and  stopped  paying  rent.  (FORM  Item  3  at  4.)  In
Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he stated that the debt was resolved, but he submitted
no  documentary  evidence  to  support  his  claim.  Applicant  received  an  offer  in  2019  to
settle the debt for $3,900, payable by May 7, 2019. (AX A at 25.) However, he submitted
no evidence that he paid the agreed amount by the due date. The debt is not reflected in
a credit report dated January 30, 2020, submitted by Applicant in response to the FORM,
or in the credit report dated February 7, 2020, included in the FORM. (FORM Item 4; AX
A at 29-41.).
SOR ¶ 1.g: telecommunications account placed for collection of $2,133. This
debt, a cellphone account, was placed for collection in March 2017. It was settled for less
than the full amount in March 2020. (AX A at 22.)
SOR ¶ 1.h: collection account for $1,395. This debt was referred for collection
in July 2018. The nature of the debt is not reflected in the record. In Applicant’s answer,
he stated that the debt was paid in full. When he was interviewed by a security investigator
in January 2019, he told the investigator that he paid the debt in November 2018. He did
not provide documentary evidence of payment in his answer to the SOR or his response
to the FORM. The debt is reflected in the October 2018 credit report (FORM Item 6 at 9),
but it is not reflected in the credit reports from August 2019 and February 2020 (FORM
Items 5 and 6), nor is it reflected in the February 2020 credit report submitted by Applicant
in his response to the FORM. (AX A at 29-41.)
SOR ¶ 1.i: insurance debt placed for collection of $120. In the January 2019
security interview, Applicant admitted that this debt was referred for collection in 2017.
(FORM Item 3 at 4.) It was paid in full in March 2020. (AX A at 20.)
