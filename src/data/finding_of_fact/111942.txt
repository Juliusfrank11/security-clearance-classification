Applicant is a 50-year-old aviator for a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance.  The  allegations  covered  in  the  SOR  and  admitted  by  Applicant  are
incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant married in June 1996 and divorced in May 2009. (Item 3) He has three
children  from  this  marriage  (ages  20,  17,  and  15).  He  remarried  in  October  2012  and
has five stepchildren from this marriage (ages 39, 28, 18, 15, and 12). (Item 2) Applicant
earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  June  1994.  He  joined  the  Air  Force  in  June  1994
following  his  college  graduation  and  served  10  years  of  active  duty  and  four  years  of
active reserve before receiving his honorable discharge in October 2008. (Item 8)
Since February 2017, Applicant has been employed as an aviator by his current
defense  contractor.  (Items  3  and  4)  Between  March  2015  and  January  2017,  he  was
employed  by  another  company  in  the  same  capacity,  located  in  a  state  closer  to  his
current state of residence. GE 1; Tr. 140) And, between March 2008 and March 2015,
he was  employed by other  employers  as an aviator  in  other  states  much farther  away
from his current state of employment and residence. (Items 3-4)
Applicant’s finances
In March 2015, Applicant took a lower paying aviator’s position in a state much
closer to his current state of residence to be nearer to his wife and children. (Items 1-4)
With  this  lower  paying  position,  he  encountered  difficulties  keeping  up  with  his  child
support and consumer obligations and fell behind in his payment responsibilities. (Items
1-4)
In an effort to address his child support arrears (in excess of $40,000), Applicant
applied  in  2015  to  his  state’s  child  services  agency  for  an  adjustment  to  his  ordered
child support payments. (Items 2-4) While waiting for a child support reduction decision
from  the  enforcing  state  agency,  he  ceased  making  payments  on  his  child  support
obligations altogether. Credit reports confirm that he has been delinquent with two credit
card accounts listed in the SOR, ¶¶ 1.b ($23,851) and 1.c ($15,307), since April 2016
and November 2017, respectively. Both credit card accounts have since been charged
off.
Until  Applicant  finds  a  higher  paying  job,  he  is  not  financially  positioned  to
address  either  his  child  support  arrears  or  his  charged-off  credit  card  delinquencies.
(Items  2-4)  While  he  remains  committed  to  addressing  these  debts  when  he  finds  a
better  paying  job,  he  has  provided  no  updates  on  his  job  searches.  He  provided  no
evidence of financial counseling or budgeting.
