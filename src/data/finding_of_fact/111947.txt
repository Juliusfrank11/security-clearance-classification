Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, except the allegation in ¶ 2.a, which
he  failed  to  answer.  His  failure  to  answer  will  be  considered  to  be  a  denial.  After  a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 54 years old. He served in the military from  1986 to 1990 and was
honorably discharged. He has a grown child from a previous relationship. He married in
2003 and has 16-year-old child and 20-year-old stepchild.
Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to periods of unemployment, which he
disclosed in his security clearance application (SCA)  were  from January 2016 to June
2016; January 2015 to May 2015; and February 2014 to June 2014. He was employed
by a government contactor from 2007 to January 2014. He also attributed it to his wife’s
loss of job due to medical issues. She reentered the workforce four months later, but her
medical issues recurred and she was again unable to work. Applicant did not provide the
specific dates when his wife lost her job, but said she was out of work a couple of years
ago for two years. It is unknown whether she is currently working. (Item 2)
The  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  are  substantiated  by  Applicant’s  admissions  and
credit reports from June 2018 and January 2019. (Items 2, 4, 5)
The  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  ($24,145)  is  a  vehicle  repossession.  The  account  was
opened in January 2015 and the last activity on it was November 2017. Applicant wrote
on the SOR: “I admit. I owe the money. But I turned the car in voluntarily.” In Applicant’s
narrative answer to the SOR, he stated: “[w]e tried to keep the [car] but with only one
person  working  I  just  couldn’t  do  it.”  (Item  2)  Applicant  did  not  provide  documentary
evidence to substantiate he has paid, made arrangements to pay, or otherwise resolved
this delinquent debt. (Items 2, 4, 5)
The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($7,217) and 1.g ($277) are charged off accounts
from the same creditor. Applicant avers that he is making payments on both. He provided
a  letter  from  November  2019  indicating  an  agreement  to  pay  $50  in  the  next  week.
Applicant  did  not  provide  documentary  evidence  that  he  made  the  agreed  upon  $50
payment or that he has made other payments on the agreement and it is resolved. (Items
2, 4, 5)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($1,813) is a telecommunications debt that Applicant admits
and stated he is on a payment plan. The debt resulted when he switched cell phone plans.
He has not provided documentary evidence to show he has paid, made arrangements to
pay, or otherwise resolved this debt. (Items 2, 4, 5)
Applicant indicated he was on a payment plan with the creditor for the debt in SOR
¶ 1.d ($909). He provided a November 2019 letter from the collection agency that holds
the account reflecting a settlement agreement with Applicant to make a payment of $25
in November 2019 and December 2019, and a final payment of $632 in January 2020.
Applicant did not provide documentary evidence to show he made any of the three agreed
upon payments, or that he has otherwise resolved the debt. (Items 2, 4, 5)
Applicant provided proof that in November 2019, he paid the delinquent medical
debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($137). Applicant admits he is responsible for the telecommunications
debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.f  ($833).  He  provided  a  letter  from  the  collection  agency  holding  the
account that reflects it agreed to settle the account with payments of $25 in November
and  December  2019,  and  a  final  payment  of  $366  in  January  2020.  Applicant  did  not
provide  documentary  evidence  to  show  he  made  the  agreed  upon  payments  or  has
otherwise resolved the debt. (Items 2, 4, 5)
Applicant completed a SCA in April 2018. Section 26 asked if in the past seven
years he had any property voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed; bills or debts turned
over to a collection agency; any accounts charged off; or if he  was currently over 120
days delinquent on any debt. Applicant answered “no” to all of those inquiries and failed
to disclose his repossessed vehicle, charged off debts, and debts in collection as alleged
in SOR ¶¶ 1.a though 1.d and 1.g. When responding to the SOR, Applicant wrote next to
¶ 1.a that he voluntarily turned in the vehicle. He stated in his answer that he attempted
to keep up with the vehicle payments, but was unable to because he was the only one
working. The last activity on this account was November 2017. Applicant was aware his
vehicle was repossessed and he was past due on payments when he submitted his SCA.
He deliberately failed to disclose this information on it. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5)
