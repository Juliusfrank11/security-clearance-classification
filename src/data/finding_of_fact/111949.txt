The SOR (GE 1) alleges under Guideline F that, as of October 31, 2019, Applicant
owed delinquent debts totaling $62,518: charged-off automobile loan debts of $7,305 (SOR
¶ 1.a) and $5,917 (SOR ¶ 1.b); a collection debt of $1,378 (SOR ¶ 1.c); a cable television
debt  of  $231  (SOR  ¶  1.d);  utility  debts  of  $195  (SOR  ¶  1.f)  and  $153  (SOR  ¶  1.g);  a
Federal income tax lien of $28,058 (SOR ¶ 1.h); a loan debt of $8,055 (SOR ¶ 1.i); an
insurance debt of $234 (SOR ¶ 1.l); a judgment debt of $9,418 (SOR ¶ 1.y); and medical
collection debt totaling $1,574 on 15 accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.j-1.k, and 1.m-1.x). Under
Guideline  E,  Applicant  is  alleged  to  have  deliberately  falsified  his  February  14,  2018
Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (or SCA) by responding
negatively to inquiries concerning any financial delinquency involving enforcement (any tax
liens in the last seven years and current delinquency on any federal debt) (SOR ¶ 2.a), and
to inquires concerning delinquency on routine accounts (any bills or debts turned over for
collection and any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled in the last
seven years) (SOR ¶ 2.b).
When he responded to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b,
1.e, 1.g-1.h, and 1.j-1.y, but indicated that several of them, including all but one of his
medical collection debts, have been paid (SOR ¶¶ 1.j-1.x); that he was making payments
on his Federal tax debt and had reduced the balance to $10,000 (SOR ¶ 1.h); and that the
judgment case for $9,418 was “closed” (SOR ¶ 1.y). Applicant denied the debts in SOR ¶¶
1.c-1.d and 1.f, stating that they had been paid, and SOR ¶ 1.i, stating that the account
was closed. Applicant admitted the alleged falsifications of his SCA and explained that he
had not checked into his tax issue. He added that he was working diligently to correct all of
his  delinquencies;  that  the  majority  of  his  debts  had  been  paid,  and  he  was  working
towards paying off the others; and that he currently had only two delinquent accounts on
his credit report. (GE 3.)
After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant’s Answer to the SOR (GE 3),
I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor (company X) involved in
ground-based operational surveillance systems. He has worked in the defense industry
since his July 2010 discharge from the United States military. (GEs 5, 7.) Applicant married
his current  spouse  in  January 2018. His first marriage ended in divorce in June 2012.
Applicant has a 24-year-old son from his first marriage with whom he has no contact. (GE
7.)  Applicant  has  a  19-year-old  stepson  and  a  six-year-old  adopted  daughter  with  his
current wife. (GEs 5, 7.)
On his graduation from high school in June 1990, Applicant enlisted in the United
States  Marine  Corps.  He  was  granted  a  DOD  secret  clearance  for  his  military  duties.
Applicant  and  his  first  wife  married  in  June  1995,  and  they  apparently  had  financial
problems from the start. On April 8, 1997, they filed a joint Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition.
The evidentiary record about the bankruptcy consists of a case summary that shows it
covered consumer debt and was discharged on October 23, 2001. The case summary
does not show the creditors, debt amounts, or payments to a trustee. (GE 9.)
While serving at the rank of staff sergeant, Applicant completed an SCA on May 10,
2007,  to  renew  his  security  clearance  eligibility  for  his  military  duties.  He  responded
negatively to all questions regarding issues of potential security concern, including financial
record inquiries into whether he had been over 180 days delinquent on any debts in the
last seven years and whether he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts. He
indicated on his SCA that he and his first wife had been separated  since December 3,
2002. (GE 4.)
On August 7, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  about  some  adverse  information  that  was
apparently on his credit record at the time. Applicant explained that he and his spouse
were in divorce proceedings, and she had his power of attorney. He denied knowledge of
the  debts  on  his  credit  record  except  for  a  car  loan  for  a  vehicle  that  was  voluntarily
repossessed around 2005. He indicated that he would investigate the eight accounts of
concern on his credit record and attempt to pay his legitimate debts. With $678 per month
going to his estranged wife and $1,886 in recurring expenses (rent, utilities, insurance,
$316 car payment, gasoline, food, cable and Internet, and cell phone costs), he estimated
that he had about $914 per month for discretionary expenses and to pay past-due debts.
(GE 6.)
On  October  18,  2007,  the  Department  of  the  Navy  Central Adjudication  Facility
(DON CAF) granted Applicant a secret clearance despite expressed concerns about the
past-due debts then on his credit record and his failure to list those debts on his SCA.
Applicant  was  advised  of  the  seriousness  of  financial  irresponsibility  and  required  to
immediately  contact  his  command’s  financial  counselor  for  assistance  in  making
arrangements to resolve his delinquent debts. The DON CAF warned him that failure to
address  his  delinquent  debts  would  be  cause  for reconsideration  of  his eligibility  for a
security clearance. Applicant was also reminded that he is responsible for ensuring that
any future SCAs are complete and accurate prior to their submission. (GE 8.)
In July 2010, Applicant was honorably discharged from the U.S. military. He worked
as a trainer for a defense contractor for about a year before relocating in August 2011 to
his current area for a position with company X. In December 2013, he accepted a training
consultant position with another defense contractor. (GE 5.)
On February 14, 2018, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an SCA
on  which  he  responded  negatively  to  all  the  financial  record  inquiries,  including  the
following:
In the last seven (7) years have you failed to file or pay Federal, state, or
other taxes when required by law or ordinance?; In the last seven (7) years,
[have] you had a judgment entered against you . . . ; In the last seven (7)
years, [have] you had a lien placed against your property for failing to pay
taxes or other debts . . . ; [Are] you currently delinquent on any Federal debt.
. . .; In the last seven (7) years, [have] you had bills or debts turned over to
a collection agency? . . .; and In the last seven (7) years, [have] you had
any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to
pay as agreed? . . .  (GE 5.)
As  of  March  1,  2018,  one  or  more  of  the  three  credit  reporting  agencies  were
reporting that Applicant owed delinquent debt on several accounts. (GE 14.) The record
evidence for each debt in the SOR is as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a is a charged-off automobile loan debt for $7,305. (GE 1.) Applicant and a
co-borrower obtained a loan for $13,295 in October 2014. The loan became delinquent in
October  2016.  In  June  2017,  the  account  was  charged  off  for  $7,891.  (GEs  14-16.)
Applicant asserts that his ex-wife was supposed to make the payments (GE 7), but he did
not explain why she would be responsible for a loan that credit reports show was opened
after his divorce was final. After a $1,457 payment in August 2018, the balance of the debt
was $7,305. (GE 16.) There is no evidence of any subsequent payments.
SOR ¶ 1.b is a charged-off vehicle loan for $5,917. (GE 1.) Applicant obtained a
$25,525 loan for a truck in October 2013. Applicant made no payments on the loan after
June 2015, and his truck was repossessed. In September 2015, his account was charged
off for $5,916. When interviewed by an authorized investigator for the OPM in October
2018, Applicant surmised that the $5,916 must be the deficiency balance on his loan. He
indicated that was never told that he had to pay the remaining balance on the loan after the
truck  was  sold,  but  that  he  would  pay  the  debt  if  required.  (GE  7.)  As of March 2020,
Applicant had made no payments toward that debt, which was still adversely affecting his
credit. (GEs 14-16.)
SOR  ¶  1.c  is  a  collection  debt  for  $1,378.  (GE  1.)  Applicant  moved  in  with  his
current  spouse  in  November 2017.  (GE  5.) In  March  7,  2018,  a  default judgment was
entered  against  Applicant  for  $1,378  in  restitution  and  court  costs  owed  to  a  property
management company. (GE 13.) As of April 2019, the debt was in collection with a $1,378
balance. (GE 15.) He claims he paid the debt. (GE 3.) As of March 2020, the debt was no
longer on his credit report (GE 16), but the court was reporting no progress by Applicant on
resolving the judgment debt. (GE 13.)
SOR ¶ 1.d is a satellite television debt in collection for $231. (GE 1.) A delinquent
balance of $231 from March 2015 was placed for collection in March 2018. As of March
2019, the debt had not been paid. (GE 15.) The debt was no longer on his credit report as
of March 2020. (GE 16.) Applicant claims it has been paid (GE 3), but he provided no
corroboration for his assertion.
SOR ¶ 1.e is a medical collection debt for $200. (GE 1.) In February 2018, a medical
creditor placed a $200 debt from September 2017 for collection. As of February 2020, the
debt had not been paid. (GEs 15-16.)
SOR ¶ 1.f is a $195 collection debt for utility services. (GE 1.) A $195 debt from
March 2018 was placed for collection in May 2019. (GE 15.) Applicant paid the debt on
October 18, 2019. (GE 16.)
SOR ¶ 1.g is a $153 collection debt for utility services with the same creditor named
in SOR ¶ 1.f. (GE 1.) The account became delinquent in September 2015, and the creditor
placed a $152 balance for collection in November 2016. The debt had not been paid. (GEs
3, 15-16.)
SOR  ¶  1.h  is  a  Federal  tax  lien  for  $28,058.  (GE  1.)  On  November  1,  2016,  a
Federal  tax  lien  of  $28,058.76  was  filed  against  Applicant  for  unpaid  taxes  and
assessments of $2,209.59 for tax year 2011, $1,190.45 for tax year 2012, and $24,658.72
for  tax  year  2013.  (GEs  10,  14.)  The  Federal  tax  lien  was  issued  to  Applicant  at  the
address where he resided from February 2011 to August 2011. (GEs 5, 10.) As of March
2018, the debt had not been paid. (GE 14.) Applicant denied any knowledge of the tax lien
as of October 2018. (GE 7.) In December 2019, he asserted that he was currently making
payments  and  that  the  balance  was  $10,000  (GE  3.)  He  provided  no  evidence of any
payments or a more recent assessment by the IRS to substantiate the claimed balance.
SOR ¶ 1.i is a loan in collection for $8,055. (GE 1.) As of March 2018, Equifax was
reporting  that  Applicant  was  a  co-maker  on  a  loan  that  was  referred  for  collection  in
January 2019 because of nonpayment since November 2011. (GE 14.) The debt was no
longer on  his credit  record  as  of  April 2019.  (GE  15.)  Applicant  disputes  the debt and
indicates that the account is closed. (GE 3.) He provided no proof that he is not legally
liable for repayment.
SOR ¶ 1.j is a $342 medical debt in collection. (GE 1.) A medical debt from October
2013 was assigned for collection in January 2014. As of February 2018, the debt balance
of $342 had not been paid. (GE 14.) The debt was no longer on his credit record as of April
2019. Applicant claims it has been paid (GE 3), but he submitted no evidence of payment.
SOR ¶ 1.k is a $237 medical debt in collection. (GE 1.) The debt was reportedly in
collection as of March 2018. (GE 14.) It was no longer on his credit record as of April 2019.
(GE  15.)  Applicant  claims  it  has  been  paid  (GE  3),  but  he  submitted  no  evidence  of
payment.
SOR ¶ 1.l is an insurance debt in collection for $234. (GE 1.) The account became
delinquent in June 2015 and was assigned for collection in September 2015. As of March
2020, the $234 balance had not been paid. (GEs 14, 16.)
SOR ¶ 1.m is a medical debt in collection for $125. (GE 1.) The debt, which is from
February 2018, had not been paid as of March 2018. (GE 14.) As of April 2019, the debt
was no longer on his credit record. (GE 15.) Applicant claims it has been paid (GE 3), but
he submitted no evidence of payment.
SOR ¶¶ 1.n-1.x are medical debts in collection, ranging from a low of $22 to a high
of $99 and totaling $670. (GE 1.) The debts were incurred between October 2012 and
October 2015. Applicant had not paid them as of March 2018. (GE 14.) The debts had
been dropped from his credit record by April 2019. (GE 15.) Applicant claims all of those
medical debts have been paid (GE 3), but he submitted no evidence of payments.
SOR ¶ 1.y is a $9,418 judgment debt from February 2018. (GE 1.) On November
21, 2017, a creditor filed for a judgment against Applicant and a co-debtor. On February 1,
2018, a default judgment was entered against them for $9,418.91. (GE 11.) The debt does
not appear on Applicant’s credit reports from March 2018 (GE 14), April 2019 (GE 15), or
March 2020 (GE 16). On July 9, 2018, Applicant’s then employer reported to the DOD CAF
that  the  company  had  received  an  order  of  garnishment.  (GE  12.)  Later  that  month,
Applicant became re-employed by company X, who won the contact from the company that
filed the incident report. (GE 7.) Applicant was credited with payments totaling $2,736.93
between July 2, 2018, and August 28, 2018, to reduce the debt balance to $7,135. (GE
11.) It is unclear whether those payments were made through wage garnishment. Applicant
presented no evidence of any subsequent payments toward the $7,135 balance.
On October 17, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the OPM about the delinquent accounts reported on his credit record as of March 2018 and
about his failure to list them on his February 2018 SCA. He volunteered that he had several
accounts placed for collection, including medical debts for allegedly unbilled co-payments,
and that he also had a truck repossessed. His explanation for not listing any debts on his
SCA was that he lacked information regarding the accounts. He asserted that his former
spouse had opened accounts in his name without his knowledge, and she failed to pay the
bills. He did not realize that his ex-wife had damaged his credit until after their divorce,
when accounts became delinquent, and he could not afford to pay them. When confronted
about the specific debts, Applicant stated that he first became aware of them when they
went to collections. He claimed to have paid all but four of his medical debts in collection.
He believed the $342 medical debt (SOR ¶ 1.j) had not been paid, but indicated that he
would address all of his remaining medical collection debts within the next few months.
Applicant did not recognize the $153 utility debt (SOR ¶ 1.g), the $234 insurance debt
(SOR ¶ 1.l), or the $237 (SOR ¶ 1.k) and $59 (SOR ¶ 1.t) medical debts. He surmised that
the  $8,055  collection  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.i)  was  opened  by  his  former  spouse  without  his
knowledge. He claimed that the $7,305 debt (SOR ¶ 1.a) was on a joint loan for his ex-
wife’s vehicle. He acknowledged that the $5,917 deficiency balance (SOR ¶ 1.b) was for
his  repossessed  truck.  Applicant  denied  any  knowledge  of  the  Federal  tax  lien,  but
indicated that he would look into it. He asserted that he lives within his means and that he
had  not  filed  for  bankruptcy  or  received  any  credit  counseling.  Applicant  did  not  avail
himself of opportunities during and after the interview to submit documentation regarding
his financial issues. (GE 7.)
The DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant on October 31, 2019, because of the
outstanding delinquencies on his credit record and because of his failure to list any past-
due debts on his February 2018 SCA. (GE 1.) In response, Applicant stated in December
2019 that several of his debts had been paid (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.d, 1.f, 1.j-1.x), and that he had
made payments to reduce the balance of his Federal tax delinquency to $10,000. (GE 3.)
He provided no documentation showing satisfaction of any debts, although his latest credit
report (GE 16) corroborates the payment of the $195 utility debt (SOR ¶ 1.f). Applicant
disputed the $8,055 debt (SOR ¶ 1.i), stating that it was “closed,” although he provided no
documentation to substantiate his dispute. He acknowledged the $9,418 judgment debt,
but indicated that it had been “closed.” Applicant maintained that he was working diligently
to correct all his debts, and that he had only two delinquent accounts currently on his credit
record. Applicant responded “Accept” to the alleged falsifications of his February 2018
SCA, but added that he had not checked for the tax lien and was working on his tax debts.
(GE 3.)
As of March 2020, Equifax was reporting three unpaid collection debts, of $200
(SOR ¶ 1.e), $153 (SOR ¶ 1.g), and $234 (SOR ¶ 1.l), and the two charged-off vehicle loan
balances of $7,305 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and $5,917 (SOR ¶ 1.b). Applicant was making timely
payments of $316 per month on an unsecured installment loan opened in May 2015 for
$12,352 and on a credit card opened in July 2019 with a credit limit of $5,000. Applicant
paid $300, which was more than his monthly scheduled payment of $101, to reduce the
balance to $5,048 as of February 2020. Applicant was also making timely payments of
$454 per month on a vehicle loan with a $22,016 balance that was obtained in December
2019. (GE 16.)
