In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted both allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is  a  55-year-old  process  mechanic  employed  by  a defense  contractor
since November 2018. He worked for non-government employers from May 1994 to June
2018  and  was  unemployed  for  five  months  before  being  hired  for  his  current  job.  He
married  in  May  1990  and  has  three  adult  children,  ages  29,  25,  and  22.  His  security
clearance application reflects that he has never held a security clearance. (FORM Item 4
at 30.)
When Applicant submitted his security clearance application, he disclosed that he
had failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2016, 2017, and
2018. He explained that he needed to obtain additional paperwork, some of which had be
obtained by his dependents. He stated that he had begun the process of obtaining the
necessary paperwork. (FORM Item 4 at 30-31.)
When  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in  May  2019,  he
admitted that he did not have a good reason for not filing his income tax returns. He told
the investigator that it took substantial time to gather his paperwork and that he “got lazy”
and did not finish gathering his paperwork. He also told the investigator that he had hired
a tax professional to prepare his returns, that his returns had been completed, and that
he intended to file them within the next two or three months. (FORM Item 5 at 4.)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he stated that he intended to file his past-due
federal and state income tax returns by the end of the year. However, he did not respond
to the FORM. Thus, there is no evidence that the returns have been filed.
