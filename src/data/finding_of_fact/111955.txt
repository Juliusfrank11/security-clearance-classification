In her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, seven of the
SOR allegations (SOR ¶¶ 1.c., 1.d., 1.g., 1.h., 1.k., 1.m., and 1.n.). Applicant’s admissions
and  accompanying  comments  are  incorporated  herein.  After  a  complete  and  thorough
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the
following findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving
as  a  security  officer  with  her  current  employer  since  October  2018.  She  had  previous
experience with another employer as both a security guard and an office coordinator from
July 2014 until February 2018. She is a 1980 high school graduate. She has never served
with the U.S. military. She has never held a security clearance. She was married in 1986
and divorced in 1997. She has two adult children, born in 1983 and 1988.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can  be  found  in  the  following  exhibits:  Item  6  (Combined  Experian,  TransUnion,  and
Equifax  Credit  Report,  dated  November  29,  2018);  Item  3  (SF  86,  dated  October  28,
2018); Item 4 (Responses to Interrogatories, dated August 6, 2019); Item 7 (Enhanced
Subject Interview, dated January 10, 2019); Item 7 (Subject Contact, dated January 29,
2019);  Item  7  (Subject  Contact,  dated  February  25,  2019);  and  Item  2  (Applicant’s
Answers to SOR, dated November 29, 2019).
Applicant reported that her financial issues arose because of a combination of two
factors  during  the  period  2016  through  2018:  low-paying  jobs  and  unemployment
(February 2018 – October 2018), or as she commented, she was down on her luck and
unemployed. (Item 7, at 7; Item 2, at 3) In addition, because she did not have enough
money to pay someone to file her federal and state income tax returns for a multiple tax
year period, or to actually pay her income taxes, she did not timely file them or pay any
income taxes. (Item 7, at 5, 7) While she was unemployed, she received unemployment
compensation, and she was supported by one of her sons. (Item 7, at 4) A review of her
2018 credit report reveals that Applicant’s financial difficulties actually predated the period
that she identified, for she actually had several accounts that became delinquent during
the  period  2012  –  2014  (Item  6,  at  6,  11-12).  It  is  noted  that  in  her  SF  86,  Applicant
reported  that  in  June  2018,  during  her  financial  struggles  with  unemployment,  she
managed to take a six-to-ten day tourism visit to two Caribbean Islands. (Item 3, at 25-
26)
In  her  October  2018  SF  86,  Applicant  listed  having  only  one  financial  issue
associated with her federal income taxes, claiming that it commenced in August 2017,
and it was related to her unemployment. She estimated that she owed $6,522 in federal
income  taxes,  but  she  also  contended  that  she  was  on  a  payment  plan,  and  she  was
making monthly payments. She denied having any other delinquent accounts. (Item 3, at
33-34) On January 10, 2019, during an interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office
of Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant did not initially identify or discuss any other
delinquent  accounts  until  she  was  confronted  by  the  investigator  with  information
associated with additional delinquent accounts. She indicated that she did not list them in
her SF 86 because she was unaware of them. (Item 7, at 5-7) Following that interview,
Applicant reported that she had obtained a credit report and learned about some of her
delinquent  accounts.  She  subsequently  furnished  the  OPM  investigator  with  payment
agreements related to two delinquent accounts. (Attachments to Item 7)
In August 2019, in response to the Interrogatories, Applicant reported that she was
working with a specific national law firm “to mitigate and remove false or incorrect and
negative  reports  on  [her]  credit. The  accounts  in  question  are  making  [her]  (sic)  credit
scores low. [She] expects these accounts and all subsequent debts to be removed from
[her]  reports  within  the  next  60  to  90  days.”  (Item  4,  at  2)  She  failed  to  submit  any
documents related to her reported association with the law firm, their purported efforts on
her behalf, or any results of any of those efforts.
In addition to the allegations related to Applicant’s failure to timely file federal and
state income tax returns for the tax years 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, the SOR alleged
12  delinquent  accounts,  including  unpaid  federal  and  state  income  taxes,  totaling
approximately $26,468. Although she claimed that she had entered into repayment plans
with some of her creditors, or that she was making payments to certain creditors, with the
exception of two documents which reflected agreed repayment plans, Applicant failed to
submit  any  documentation,  such  as  receipts,  cancelled  checks,  or  bank  account
statements, to support her positions that payments had been made to any creditors or
that she had complied with any of the expected requirements of the reported repayment
plans.
With  respect  to  Applicant’s  admitted  failure  to  timely  file  her  federal  and  state
income tax returns, the SOR allegations are as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.c. alleges that the federal income tax return for the tax years 2015, 2016,
and 2017 were not timely filed, as required. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued
account transcripts, dated July 16, 2019, that indicated that the tax returns were not filed
until May 7, 2018, and Applicant was penalized for her failures;
SOR ¶ 1.c. also alleges that the federal income tax return for the tax year 2018
was not timely filed, as required. The IRS issued a letter of verification of non-filing, dated
July 30, 2019, that indicated that the tax return was not yet filed; and
SOR ¶ 1.d. alleges that the state income tax returns for the tax years 2015, 2016,
2017, and 2018 were not timely filed, as required, and Applicant offered no evidence that
she had yet filed those state income tax returns.
With  respect  to  those  delinquent  accounts  for  which  Applicant  claimed  that  she
had repayment plans in place or that she was making payments to certain creditors, the
SOR allegations are as follows:
SOR  ¶  1.a.  alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  the  Federal  Government  for
delinquent taxes in the amount of $4,237 for the tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017. In her
2018 SF 86, she claimed she “was making monthly payments,” but failed to specify how
much was being paid or when those payments supposedly commenced. (Item 3, at 33)
During  her  January  2019  OPM  interview,  she  claimed  that  she  was  currently  paying
$25.46 per month “to each account,” but she failed to specify whether she meant federal
versus state or to the IRS for each delinquent year. (Item 7, at 5) In her Answer to the
SOR, she claimed that she made an arrangement to pay $53 per month. (Item 2, at 3)
None  of  the  documents  presented  from  the  IRS  indicate  any  installment  agreements
having been established or any payments having been received. Because Applicant failed
to submit any documentary evidence of installment agreements or payments, there are
only her unverified contentions that any positive efforts have been made;
SOR ¶ 1.b. alleges that Applicant is indebted to the state for delinquent taxes in
the amount of $790. During her January 2019 OPM interview, she acknowledged that the
delinquent balance was $790, but in her Answer to the SOR, she stated the amount was
only $279, and claimed that she had made an arrangement to make monthly payments
of  $45.  Because  she  failed  to  submit  any  documentary  evidence  of  an  installment
agreement or payments, there are only her unverified contentions that any positive efforts
have been made;
SOR ¶ 1.i. is a time-share account with an unpaid balance of approximately $514
that was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser. Applicant initially claimed to
be  unaware  of  the  account,  but  subsequently  disputed  responsibility  for  the  account
because  her  ex-boyfriend  –  the  purported  co-signer  on  the  account  –  had  declared
bankruptcy. (Item 7, at 6; Item 2, at 4) In January 2019, she agreed to a repayment plan
under which she was to start making $35 payments, with the first such payment due on
January  31,  2019.  (Letter,  dated  January  31,  2019,  attached  to  Item  7)  She  failed  to
submit any evidence that she had actually made any payments;
SOR ¶ 1.k. is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of approximately $391
that  was  placed  for  collection.  In  December  2018,  the  collection  agent  offered  her  a
discount if she would start making payments on the account, and the following month she
agreed to a repayment plan under which she was to make a $25 payment on January 31,
2019,  to  be  following  by  monthly  payments  of  approximately  $61  through  July  2019.
(Letters dated December 19, 2018, and January 31, 2019, attached to Item 7) She failed
to submit any evidence that she had actually made any such payments.
With respect to those delinquent accounts for which Applicant did not claim that
she had repayment plans in place or that she was making payments to any creditors, the
SOR allegations are as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.e is an automobile loan with an unpaid balance of $5,546 that was placed
for collection (Item 6, at 6); SOR ¶ 1.f. is an unspecified type of account with an unpaid
balance of $2,337 that was placed for collection and charged off (Item 6, at 6; Item 7, at
7); SOR ¶ 1.g. is a charge account with an unpaid balance of $32 that was placed for
collection (Item 6, at 6; Item 7, at 7); SOR ¶ 1.h. is an unspecified type of account with an
unpaid balance of $11,770, of which $881 was past due that was placed for collection
(Item 6, at 8); SOR ¶ 1.j. is a cellular-telephone account with an unpaid balance of $404
that was placed for collection (Item 6, at 11); SOR ¶ 1.l. is a cellular-telephone account
with an unpaid balance of $296 that was placed for collection (Item 6, at 11); and SOR
¶¶ 1.m. and 1.n. are medical accounts with unpaid balances of $81 and $70 that were
placed for collection (Item 6, at 12).
The IRS account transcripts reflect the following adjusted gross incomes for the
years in question: $31,376 (2015); $28,106 (2016); and $29,861 (2017). (Attachments to
Item 4) It is not known what Applicant’s 2018 or 2019 adjusted gross income was, or what
current financial resources may be because she did not report her current net monthly
income;  monthly  expenses;  and  any  monthly  remainder  that  might  be  available  for
discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence
of  financial  counseling.  In  the  absence  of  additional  financial  information,  it  remains
difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than she had
been.
