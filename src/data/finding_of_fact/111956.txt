The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of November 8, 2019, Applicant owes
charged-off debts of $18,145 (SOR ¶ 1.a); $6,699 (SOR ¶ 1.b); and $2,168 (SOR ¶ 1.d);
and collection debts of $3,066 (SOR ¶1.c); $895 (SOR ¶ 1.e); $4,763 (SOR ¶ 1.f); $4,593
(SOR ¶ 1.g); and $437 (SOR ¶ 1.h). (Item 1.)  When Applicant answered the SOR, he
admitted the debts and asserted he was making a good-faith effort to address the debts in
SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.d,  1.e,  and  1.h  through  a  DMP.  He  stated  that  he  had  entered  into
agreements with the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.f, and 1.g to make monthly payments on
those  debts  and  was  adhering  to  those  agreements.  He  related  that  he  was  pursuing
refinancing options to repay his student-loan debt (SOR ¶ 1.c). (Item 2.)
After considering Items 1 through 6, which includes Applicant’s response to the SOR
(Item 2), and Applicant’s response to the FORM (AE A), I make the following findings of
fact:
Applicant is 39 years old and a native of the Philippines. He came to the United
States as a child and became a naturalized U.S. citizen on his own application in July 2008.
He earned a bachelor’s degree in May 2004 and a master’s degree in May 2014. Applicant
has worked for a succession of defense contractors since July 2014, and he was granted a
DOD secret clearance in September 2014. (Item 3.)
Applicant  was  married  from  January  2012  to  December  2015.  He  lived  with  his
parents from May 2014 to January 2016, when he began a cohabitant relationship with his
current girlfriend, so he and his ex-wife may have separated in May 2014. In October 2018,
Applicant began renting an apartment near his girlfriend, and he was spending about 30%
of his time in that apartment. Applicant has two daughters, age 8 years and age 11 months,
respectively. They live with him and his cohabitant girlfriend. (Items 3-4.)
After  graduating  from  college,  Applicant  worked  as  a  computer-aided  design
technician  for  an  engineering  company  until  April  2005.  He  then  worked  as  a  service
manager until October 2013, when he was laid off. He was unemployed from November
2013 to July 2014. He collected unemployment benefits and was a stay-at-home father
while  his  ex-wife  worked.  In  July  2014,  Applicant  began  working  as  an  analyst  in  the
defense industry. He began his current employment in July 2018. (Item 3.) Applicant did not
provide  any  details  about  his  income  when  he  was  employed  or  his  unemployment
compensation.
As part of the DOD Continuous Evaluation Program, Applicant’s credit was checked
on  November  7,  2018.  Seven  delinquent  accounts  totaling  $37,729  were  on  his  credit
report. (Item 6.)  On March 11, 2019, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to financial inquiries into
delinquency  involving  routine  accounts,  Applicant  indicated  that  he  lost  a  home  to
foreclosure  in  December  2016  after  being  unable  to  pay  his  mortgage  due  to  limited
income. (Item 3.) Available credit information shows that he obtained a $137,040 mortgage
loan in October 2008, to be repaid at $1,095 monthly. He was current on his mortgage
payments during his marriage, but he defaulted on the payments after his divorce. The loan
balance was paid by insurance. (Item 5.) Applicant also listed on his SF 86 collection debts
of $4,763 (SOR ¶ 1.f); $5,030 (SOR ¶1.g); and $310 (not alleged in SOR). He indicated
that he had an established repayment plan for the $4,763 that will conclude in August 2020;
was  awaiting  a  repayment  plan  for  the  $5,030  debt;  and  had  paid  the  medical  debt  in
February 2019. (Item 3.)
As of March 23, 2019, Applicant’s credit report showed the following delinquencies
on his credit record:
  A credit-card account opened in September 2005 was charged off for $18,145 in
May 2017 due to inactivity since September 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.a). As of March 2019,
the debt was unpaid.
  An $8,000 line-of-credit account opened in May 2006 was charged off for $6,699 in
December 2017 for failure to make the $169 monthly payment since June 2017
(SOR ¶ 1.b). As of February 2019, the debt was unpaid.
  A student loan obtained in August 1999 for $6,060 was in collection for $3,066 for
failure to make the $64 monthly payment since February 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.c). As of
March 2019, the debt was unpaid.
  A  credit-card  account  opened  in  February  2005  was  charged  off  for  $2,168  in
August 2017 for nonpayment since December 2016. As of March 2019, the account
balance was $2,162 (SOR ¶ 1.d).
  A retail charge account opened in February 2008 with a $700 credit limit was in
collection for $895 due to nonpayment since October 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.e). As of March
2019, the debt was unpaid.
  A  $4,763  charge-account  delinquency  from  February  2017  was  acquired  by  a
collection entity in June 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.f). As of March 2019, the debt was unpaid.
  A $4,593 credit-card balance from January 2017 was placed for collection in August
2017 (SOR ¶ 1.g). As of March 2019, the debt was unpaid.
  A  $437  credit-card  balance  from  December  2016  was  placed  for  collection  in
November 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.h). As of March 2019, the debt was unpaid.
As of February 2019, Applicant was making timely payments on a credit card with a
$1,200 balance. He owed federal student-loan debts of $100,239 and $22,066, which were
rated as current. (Item 5.) Apparently, they were in a hardship deferment as Applicant was
making no payments on his student loans. (AE A.)
On April 23, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant attributed his financial delinquencies to
his lack of income and divorce proceedings, although he did not provide any details of his
income or the cost of his divorce. He indicated that he has been repaying the debt in SOR ¶
1.f at $247 per month, and that he was still trying to negotiate repayment plans for the
credit-card debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h. Applicant denied that he had any accounts in
collection or more than 120 days past due. Then confronted about the $895 delinquency
(SOR ¶ 1.e), Applicant indicated that he though he had paid it off, and he indicated that he
would provide proof of satisfaction within five days. Applicant denied that he had any other
delinquent accounts. When then confronted with the $3,066 student loan (SOR ¶ 1.c),
Applicant admitted that he had not resolved the debt. When confronted about the charged-
off credit-card debts for $18,145 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and $2,168 (SOR ¶ 1.d), and the charged-off
personal loan for $6,699 (SOR ¶ 1.b), Applicant expressed his belief that the debts never
went to collections, and because the debts had been charged off, he did not have to report
them on his SF 86 or take any action to resolve them. He stated that he was willing to pay
the  debts,  but  that  they  had  been  charged  off.  Applicant  had  not  had  any  financial
counseling, but admitted that he had been irresponsible in relying too heavily on consumer
credit cards. He expressed an intention to avoid incurring delinquent debts in the future,
and indicated that his financial situation was improving. (Item 5.)
Payment records indicate that, on March 18, 2019, Applicant made the first of $264
monthly payments toward debt in SOR ¶ 1.f. As of his February 4, 2020 payment, he had
made 12 payments totaling $3,175 toward the debt. On October 18, 2019, Applicant made
a $356 payment toward the collection entity holding the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h. After
that payment, he made $136 monthly payments from November 2019 through January
2020. (AE A.) Those payments were apparently being allocated to the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g.
(Item 2.)
On October 25, 2019, Applicant entered into a DMP in which he listed $35,577 in
unsecured debt (SOR ¶ 1.a, $18,145; SOR ¶ 1.b, $6,699; SOR ¶ 1.d, $2,162; SOR ¶ 1.e,
$895; SOR ¶ 1.f, $2,646; SOR 1.g, $4,593; and SOR ¶ 1.h, $437). Under the DMP, he
agreed  to  make  $835  monthly  payments  starting  November  1,  2019,  with  $763  of  his
monthly  payment  to  be  paid  out  to  his  creditors.  Under  the  DMP,  his  debts  would  be
liquidated over the next 52 months. Applicant continued to make separate payments to the
creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.f-1.h while also making payments under the DMP. Following an initial
$50 payment to enter the DMP, Applicant made DMP payments of $985 in November 2019
and December 2019, and of $893 in January 2020 and February 2020. As of his response
to the FORM, he had paid a total of $3,806 to the DMP. (AE A.)
As of October 2019, Applicant was paying $315 a month on a vehicle loan, $800 a
month  in  utility  expenses,  $2,099  for  housing,  $15  a  month  toward  a  credit  card,  and
$1,043  in  miscellaneous  household  expenses.  He  was  setting  $25  a  month  aside  as
required  by  an  unspecified  “hardship  program.”  He  reported  net  income  of  $5,150  per
month. (AE A.)
On November 8, 2019, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant because of his
defaulted student loan and the consumer-credit delinquencies included in his DMP. When
Applicant responded to the SOR, he indicated that he was making payments toward the
debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b, 1.d-1.e, and 1.h through the DMP, and toward the debts in SOR
¶¶  1.f  and  1.g  under  separate  agreements  with  those  creditors.  (Item  2.)  He  provided
documentation showing his payments in response to the FORM in February 2020. (AE A.)
