Applicant  is  a  51-year-old  instructor  for  a  defense  contractor  who  seeks  a
security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are
incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant  married  in  August  1995  and  separated  in  May  2002.  (Item  3)  He  has
one  adult  child  from  this  marriage.  Applicant  earned  an  associate’s  degree  from  a
business college in September 2002. (Item 3)  He enlisted in the U.S. Army in February
1987  and  served  eight  and  one-half  years.  (Item  3)  He  received  in  August  1997  for
reported medical reasons. (Item 3) Since February 2011, Applicant has been employed
as an instructor for a defense contractor. (Item 3)  He reported unemployment between
November  2010  and  February  2011  and  worked  for  various  non-defense  contractors
between  1997  and  2010.  (Item 3)  Applicant held  a  security  clearance  during  his Army
enlistment at the level of secret. (Item 3)
Applicant’s finances
Between  November  2011  and  May  2019,  Applicant  accumulated  15  delinquent
debts  exceeding  $27,000.  (Items  4-6)  He  provided  no  documentation  showing  that  he
has  addressed  any  of  these  listed  accounts,  and  they  remain  unresolved  and
outstanding.  Records also  confirm  that  Applicant failed  to file  state  income  tax  returns
for tax years 2010 through 2018. While he claims to have paid the only tax debt owing
to  the  state  (i.e.,  the  sum  of  $275)  with  his  2019  state  tax  return,  he  provided  no
documentation  of  any  amounts  paid  or  owing  and  since  resolved.  He  attributed  his
failures to file state income tax returns to his beliefs that he did not owe anything. (Item
4) Undetermined at this time is whether Applicant ever filed state tax returns for the tax
years stated (2010-2018) and whether he owes any monies for these tax years. Without
documentation  of  filing  his  returns  for  these  years  and  paying  any  amounts  owing,  he
cannot be credited with resolving any of the tax issues raised in the SOR.
