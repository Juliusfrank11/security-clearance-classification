The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of December 13, 2019, Applicant owed
delinquent debt totaling $24,646 on eight accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.h). Under Guideline E,
Applicant  is  alleged  to  have  deliberately  falsified  his  February  13,  2019  Electronic
Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (or security clearance application
(SCA)) by responding negatively to inquiries concerning whether he had any debts turned
over for collection in the last seven years and whether he had any accounts or credit cards
suspended, charged off, or cancelled in the last seven years (SOR ¶ 2.a).
When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he admitted each of the debts but
indicated that the debts in SOR ¶¶  1.d and 1.h had been paid. He answered “I admit”
regarding  the  negative  responses  to  the  financial  inquiries  on  his  SCA,  but  he  then
described it as “simply a mistake on [his] part,” and added that he “was not trying to hide
anything.” (GE 2.)
Applicant’s admissions to the debts are accepted as findings of fact. His response to
SOR ¶ 2.a is seen as an admission to having responded negatively to the inquiries but
without intention to falsify. After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant’s Answer
to the SOR (GE 2), and Applicant’s response to the FORM (AE A), I make the following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 32-year-old senior electrical technician who has worked for a defense
contractor since February 2019. He requires a DOD security clearance for his position.
(GEs 3-4.) He was apparently issued an interim security clearance that was withdrawn. (GE
2; AE A.) Applicant earned an associate’s degree in September 2011. He has been married
since November 2013. He has two sons who live with him and his wife. The younger son,
who was born in January 2017, is adopted. (GEs 2-3.)  It is unclear whether Applicant’s
older son, who does not bear his surname, is his biological son, adopted, a stepson, or a
foster  child.  If  the  birthdates  listed  on  the  SCA  for  Applicant  and  this  son  are  correct,
Applicant was only 13 years old at the time of his son’s birth.
Applicant  was  unemployed  while  pursuing  his  associate’s  degree  at  a  technical
institute from September 2009 to September 2011. He obtained federal student loans of
$3,500 and $6,000 in January 2010, a private student loan for $5,955 in July 2010, and a
federal  student  loan  for  $18,742  in  September  2010.  Applicant  worked  as  a  master
technician for a commercial electronics company from January 2012 to November 2014,
when he left the job voluntarily to move from state X to state Y. He was unemployed for the
next  six  months.  From  May  2015  to  August  2017,  Applicant  was  employed  as  a  test
technician for a power company. In August 2017, he and his family moved back to state X,
and Applicant returned to work for the commercial electronics company for the next 14
months. In October 2018, Applicant and his family moved to their current residence, and he
started a new job as a quality technician for a technology company. Applicant began his
current employment in February 2019 at a higher salary than in his previous employments.
(GEs  3-4.)  The  record  contains  no  information  about  his  previous  earnings.  As  for  his
current income, Applicant indicated only that he makes less than $2,919 a month. It is
unclear whether he was referring to his gross or net income. (AE A.)
On February 13, 2019, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an SCA
for his current employment. He responded negatively to all of the financial record inquiries,
including the following questions concerning delinquency involving routine accounts:
In the last seven (7) years, [have] you had bills or debts turned over to a
collection agency? . . . [and] In the last seven (7) years, [have] you had any
account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay
as agreed?. . . . (GE 3.)
As  of  March  5,  2019,  one  or  more  of  the  three  credit  reporting  agencies  were
reporting that Applicant’s federal student loans with balances of $27,205 and $15,100 were
in deferment, although they had been seriously past due in early 2015. Some accounts had
been paid in collection back in March 2016, but Applicant was reportedly delinquent on the
eight accounts alleged in the SOR. (GE 5.) The record evidence for each debt in the SOR
is as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a is a charged-off loan debt for $17,614.  (GE 1.) Applicant and a joint
borrower (likely his spouse) obtained a vehicle loan for $26,819 in October 2016 and fell
behind in their payments from the start. The loan was past-due 30 days in November 2016
and 90 days in April 2017 before the vehicle was repossessed. The loan was charged off
for $17,614 in June 2017. (GEs 2, 4-5; AE A.) Applicant explained that he fell behind in his
payments because his wife “had to quit her job to take care of [their] son,” and other family
needs took priority. (GEs 2, 4.)  On January 17, 2020, in response to the SOR, Applicant
indicated that he would contact the creditor to establish a repayment plan. (GE 2.) He had
no payment plan established as of his March 2020 response to the FORM. The collection
entity now handling the debt is only willing to accept payments “on a 6-month schedule,
which would amount to $2,919 per month,” which is more than he earns in a month. (AE A.)
SOR ¶ 1.b is a charged-off student loan for $2,744. (GE 1.) Applicant obtained an
unsecured guarantee loan for $5,955 in June 2010 with repayment at $22 a month. A debt
of $2,744 was charged off after no account activity since September 2013. As of January
2019, the account was $1,531 past due with a balance of $2,744. (GE 5.) After he received
the SOR, Applicant  arranged to repay the debt at $80 a month. He made his first $80
payment on March 10, 2020. If his clearance eligibility is reinstated, he anticipates that he
will be able to make a larger payment to settle the debt, which now stands at $2,663. (AE
A.)
SOR ¶ 1.c is a joint deposit-related debt for $156. (GE 1.) Applicant and a joint
owner opened a bank account in January 2012. After the account was closed, $156 in
overdraft fees were charged off in April 2016. (GEs 4-5.) Applicant recognized the debt
when  questioned  about  it  during  his  May  2019  PSI  and  indicated that  his  spouse  was
staying in touch with the creditor and trying to settle the account. (GE 4.) Yet, when he
answered the SOR in January 2020, Applicant stated that he had previously been unaware
of  the  debt  and  indicated  he  would  contact  the  creditor  to  make  a  payment.  (GE  2.)
Applicant’s spouse paid $156.63 by credit card on February 28, 2020, which resolved the
debt. (AE A.)
SOR ¶ 1.d is a cellular phone debt in collection for $3,257. (GE 1.) Applicant recalled
during his PSI that when he switched providers, his new provider promised to pay off his
old contract for him, but failed to do so. (GE 4.) His account was assigned for collection in
June 2017 after no activity since April 2015. As of February 2019, the debt had not been
paid. (GEs 4-5.) Applicant asserted in response to the SOR on January 17, 2020, that the
debt  had  been  paid,  and  that  the  account  was  closed  as  of  January  4,  2020.  (GE  2.)
Applicant’s March 2020 credit report shows that the debt was legally satisfied for less than
the  full  balance.  A  statement  from  the  collection  entity  shows  that  he  paid  $651  in  full
settlement of the debt on August 15, 2019. (AE A.)
SOR ¶ 1.e is a phone debt in collection for $300, which Applicant indicates was
incurred in  state Y and then not paid after he and his family moved back to  state X in
August 2017. (GE 2.) His account was assigned for collection in December 2018. As of
February 2019, the debt had not been paid. (GE 5.) Applicant attributes the debt to him and
his family living beyond their means (GE 2), although he provided no specific information in
that regard. Applicant paid the debt on February 26, 2020. (AE A.)
SOR ¶ 1.f is a cable television debt in collection for $260, which was a bill for service
in state Y that went unpaid after he and his family moved back to state X. (GE 2.) His
account was assigned for collection in December 2018. As of February 2019, the debt had
not been paid. (GE 5.) Applicant provided documentation showing that he paid $137 by
credit card on February 26, 2020. Experian is reporting the debt as paid after collection as
of March 1, 2020. (AE A.)
SOR ¶ 1.g is a medical debt in collection for $163 from August 2015. His account
was assigned for collection in May 2016. As of February 2019, the debt had not been paid.
(GE 5.) On January 17, 2020, Applicant stated that he would contact the collection entity
and pay the debt this year. (GE 2.) Applicant satisfied the debt on February 26, 2020. (AE
A.)
SOR ¶ 1.h is a collection debt for $152 incurred with a credit services company. His
account was assigned for collection in January 2019 after no  activity since September
2018. As of February 2019, the credit bureaus were reporting the debt as unpaid. (GE 5.) In
response to the SOR, Applicant provided a confirmation number as evidence that he had
paid the debt on February 28, 2019. (GE 2.) Creditor documentation submitted by Applicant
in response to the FORM corroborates the debt was paid in full in February 2019. (AE A.)
On May 2, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) about his delinquent accounts and his failure to list
them  on  his  SCA.  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  had  some  financial  issues,  but  he
explained that he did not know specific information about his accounts because his spouse
handled their finances. He indicated that his debts had been paid, but when confronted with
the adverse information on his March 2019 credit report, Applicant did not dispute that he
still owed the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d. He provided some details about the debts, including
that the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a was owed on a loan for a repossessed vehicle, and indicated
that  his  spouse  was  trying to  settle  those debts. He did not recognize some collection
debts, including the debts in SOR ¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h but expressed his belief that those
three  debts  and  a  medical  bill  not  covered  by  insurance  (SOR  ¶  1.g)  had  been  paid.
Applicant  explained  that  his  financial  issues  were  due  to  “hard  times”  and  not to living
beyond  his  means,  carelessness,  or  financial  irresponsibility.  He  cited  his  geographic
relocations and changes of jobs, which put him in the position of having to catch up on
expenses. He described his current financial situation as stable, and indicated that with the
income from his current job, he can save money to pay off his collection debts. Applicant
expressed a willingness to pay all his debts. He admitted that he had not had any financial
counseling or utilized any debt consolidation services, but he and his spouse were working
on rebuilding their credit, saving money, and paying their bills. In response to why he had
not listed any delinquencies on his SCA, Applicant stated that he was unsure how to report
the information because he did not feel that his situation fit the specific sections, and there
was no place for comments to explain his financial situation. (GE 4.)
The DCSA CAF issued an SOR to Applicant on December 13, 2019, because of the
outstanding delinquencies listed on his March 2019 credit report and because of his failure
to  list  any  past-due  debts  on  his  February  2019  SCA.  (GE  1.)  In  response,  Applicant
admitted the debts and stated in part:
These charges were from a particularly difficult time in life, we were living
paycheck to paycheck and any time something happened we had to make a
sacrifice. We would have to choose which bills to pay at which time. At that
time we were not able to regularly catch back up. At my current position I am
doing much better with my bills and keeping up with things. (GE 2.)
Applicant indicated on January 17, 2020, that he would make arrangements to repay
the defaulted car loan (SOR ¶ 1.a) and that he would pay his other outstanding debts (SOR
¶¶ 1.b-1.c and 1.e-1.g) this year. He stated that the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.h had been
paid, and provided a confirmation number for the latter but no documentation of payment
for either debt. Applicant explained that the defaulted car loan did not appear on his credit
report and that he would have taken care of the debts sooner had he the means to do so.
He expected to be able to address his remaining financial issues “once [his] clearance is
reinstated.” As for his failure to list any debs on his SCA, Applicant stated:
This was simply a mistake on my part. I spoke to an investigator about this
issue in April [sic] of last year, before my interim clearance was issued. I was
not trying to hide anything and am honest about my financial struggles. (GE
2.)
In the Government’s February 27, 2020 FORM, Department Counsel noted the lack
of  specific  information  in  the  record  about  circumstances  that  apparently  stressed
Applicant’s finances, and the absence of corroborating or supporting documentation from
Applicant showing resolution of any of the SOR debts. In response on March 18, 2020,
Applicant provided a recent credit report and receipts showing that he had an established
plan to repay the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b and had resolved the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.h, as
noted above. He explained that the collection entity currently holding his defaulted car loan
(SOR  ¶  1.a)  wants  payments  that  he  cannot  afford  and  is  unwilling  to  work  with  him.
Applicant indicated that he would continue to try to resolve the account, and added:
As I stated in my subject interview, these issues were from a time that I was
not in a financially stable position to settle these debts. In my current position,
with  my  clearance  reinstated,  I  can  continue  to  make  smart  financial
decisions and work on my credit. (AE A.)
The record contains little detail about Applicant’s income, expenses, or savings. As
of March 2010, Experian reported that he had a $129 current balance on a low-limit credit-
card account opened in August 2019 and a $2,880 balance on a joint installment loan
obtained for $3,221 in August 2019 that was being repaid on time at $129 a month. His
federal student loans were in deferment with balances of $35,937 and $15,850. They were
rated as current but had been 120 days or more delinquent in May and June 2014 and
again in January and February 2015. In February 2017, Applicant paid off a vehicle loan
obtained for $24,299 in May 2015. The car loan for the repossessed vehicle (SOR ¶ 1.a)
was still on his credit report as past due for $17,614 (SOR ¶ 1.a). His credit score was 594
as of March 18, 2020, which is considered “fair.” (AE A.)
