In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations and explained
what  actions  he  was  taking  to  resolve  the  delinquent  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  His
admissions and explanations are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is 57 years old and is seeking employment by a federal contractor in a
public trust position. He was self-employed as a construction worker from August 2006 to
September  2009  and  has  been  self-employed  as  a  home-repair  service  provider  from
