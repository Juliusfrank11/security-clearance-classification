In her Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.f and denied
SOR ¶¶ 1.g to 1.i. I construe her lack of a specific admission or denial to SOR ¶ 2.a as
a denial. (Answer)
Applicant is 27 years old. As of her Answer, she was single and did not have any
children. She graduated from high school in June 2011 and earned a bachelor’s degree
in  May  2018.  She  has  worked  as  a  systems  engineer  for  a  defense  contractor  since
August 2018. She has never held a security clearance. (GE 1)
Applicant  recreationally  used:  (1)  marijuana,  with  varying  frequency,  from  June
2008  to  October  2018;  (2)  ecstasy,  10  to  20  times,  from  June  2011  to  July  2018;  (3)
cocaine,  with  varying  frequency,  from  January  2014  to  July  2018;  and  (4)  LSD  in
November  2017.  She first used marijuana  in  high school,  at  age  15.  She continued  to
use marijuana in high school, from ages 15 to 18, approximately four times monthly with
friends. In college, from ages 18 to 22, she used marijuana daily to four times a week, at
parties  or  friends’  homes.  During  her  latter  years  in  college,  from  ages  22  to  25,  she
used  marijuana  between  10  to  48  times  a  year.  In  2018,  at  age  25,  she  smoked
marijuana approximately 20 times. She used marijuana in October 2018 while attending
a college homecoming game. She approximated in her August 2018 security clearance
application  (SCA)  that  she smoked marijuana “well over  1000”  times  in  total.  Between
October 2012 and July 2015, she purchased marijuana from a friend “pretty frequently,”
approximately 30 times, for her personal use. (GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s first use of ecstasy in 2011, at age 18, was at her high-school prom.
She  subsequently  used  ecstasy  during  the  weekends  from  2011  to  2018  at  friends’
homes,  music  festivals,  or  during  trips  to  state  A.  She  used  ecstasy  in  July  2018  at  a
music festival. (GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s first use of cocaine in 2014, at age 21, was with a friend at a college
party. From 2014 to 2015, she used cocaine four times monthly during the weekends at
college  parties  or  concerts.  From  2015  to  2018,  she  used  cocaine  two  to  three  times
yearly at music festivals. She used cocaine in July 2018 during a weekend trip to state
A. Between April 2016 and May 2018, she purchased cocaine twice for a music festival
and a few other times while consuming alcohol. She attributed her purchase of cocaine
to being “young and dumb.” She stated in her SCA and during her background interview
that she did not intend to use cocaine again because she did not like the next-day side
effects  and  she  did  not  want  to  risk  her  job.  Applicant’s  one-time  use  of  LSD  in  2017
was at a concert with a friend.   (GE 1, 2)
Applicant  stated  in  her  SCA  that  she  intended  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future
because  “[i]t’s  not  illegal  in  [state  B--the  state  in  which  her  family  resides]  and  I  enjoy
the effects of THC.” She also stated that she would “most likely use [ecstasy] again if I
go to another music festival” and she “might take LSD at a music festival.” She stated
during her January 2019 background interview, however, that she no longer wanted to
use illegal drugs. She also stated that she had no future intent to purchase marijuana or
cocaine. She stated that her motivation to stop using and purchasing illegal drugs was
her  employment.  She acknowledged  during  her  interview  that  she  still  associated  with
the individuals with whom she previously used illegal drugs. In January 2020, Applicant
signed a statement of intent to not use any illegal drugs or abuse any prescription drugs
in the future. (Answer; GE 1, 2)
Applicant received an award from her employer in December 2019 for excellent
performance.  Her  first  character  reference,  her  boyfriend  whom  she  met  in  2018
through  mutual  work  friends,  described  her  as  extremely  reliable  and  a  serious
employee.  He  stated that  he held  a security  clearance and  he  was  aware of  the  SOR
allegations. He wrote:
[Applicant]  moved  very  far  away  from  the  people  and  places  which  were
associated  with  her  past  indiscretions  with  drugs  and  is  in  a  completely
different environment which doesn’t promote that sort of behavior. I have
never  see  that  type  of  behavior  nor  do  I  think  it  will  recur  based  on  her
dedicated work ethic.
(Answer)
Applicant’s  second  character  reference  is  a  friend  of  two  years  and  a  U.S.
military  veteran  who  previously  held  a  security  clearance.  He  stated  that  he  and
Applicant  became  friends  through  his  wife,  whom  Applicant  met  at  work,  and  they
socialize  frequently  for  dinner  or  game  nights.  He  stated  that  Applicant  did  not  truly
understand the seriousness of a security clearance until after she moved to state C and
began  working  for  her  current  employer.  He  described  her  as  a  career-oriented,
responsible, and trustworthy individual. (Answer)
