Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 48 years old. He served in the military from 1993 to 1996. He earned
an associate’s degree in 2001 and a bachelor’s degree in 2007. He first married in 1993
and divorced in 1996. He remarried in 1998 and divorced in 2008. He remarried in 2009.
He has two children, ages 9 and 2, and an 18-year-old stepchild. Applicant worked for

February  2019.  He  did  not  disclose  any  periods  of  unemployment  on  his  April  2019
security clearance application (SCA). (Item 3)
The  SOR  alleges  14  delinquent  debts  ranging  from  $23  to  $4,291,  totaling
approximately $24,742.  The debts are corroborated by an April 2019 credit report and
Applicant’s admissions and statements. (Items 3, 4, 5)
Applicant  disclosed  to  a  government  investigator,  during  his  June  2019
background investigation, that his financial problems were due to a divorce, job loss, and
not earning enough income. He also stated he fell behind on bills when his son was born.
His son was born in 2010. His daughter was born in 2017. He also stated his financial
problems began in 2015, but did not elaborate. He told the investigator that he planned
to hire someone to help him resolve his debts. He indicated he would attempt to contact
a debt consolidation company. He has not received financial counseling.  Applicant did
not provide evidence of any action he may have taken to resolve any of the SOR debts.
