In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR allegations. (Item 2) He
did not provide any supporting documentation about the status of delinquent debts in his
SOR  response.  Applicant’s  admissions  are  accepted  as  findings  of  fact.  Additional
findings follows.
Applicant is a 44-year-old systems data analyst employed by a DOD contractor
since July 2009. (Item 3 at 7, 14) From 1993 to 2009, he served on active duty in the
Navy, and he received an honorable discharge. (Id. at 17-18) In 1993, he received a
high school diploma. (Id. at 12) In 2018, he received a bachelor’s degree. (Id. at 13) In
1996, he married, and he is currently separated from his spouse. (Id. at 20-21) His
children were born in 1997, 2000, 2009, and 2011. (Id. at 25-27) There is no evidence
of workplace misconduct or criminal conduct. He did not provide copies of performance
evaluations or character references.
Financial Considerations
The  SOR  alleges  eight  delinquent  debts  totaling  $49,961  as  follows:  1.a  is  a
charged-off debt for $5,895; 1.b is a charged-off debt for $4,295; 1.c is a bank debt placed
for  collection  for  $4,501;  1.d  is  a  bank  debt  placed  for  collection  for  $16,501;  1.e  is  a
charged-off debt for $4,180; 1.f is a charged-off debt for $4,312; 1.g is a charged-off store
debt for $1,896; and 1.h is a charged-off debt for $8,841.
In his April 15, 2019 SCA, Applicant said the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($5,895), 1.b
($4,285),  1.d  ($16,359),  1.f  ($4,312),  1.g  ($1,896),  and  1.h  ($8,841)  resulted  from  his
“[i]nability  to  make  payments  after  sep[a]ration  from  spouse  and  solely  funding  my
sustainment and agreements for child and spousal support during sep[a]ration.” (Item 2
at 40-46). As for actions taken to resolve these debts, he said “No current action taken.
When funds are available, [I] will work to make payments if before 3/2020 at which point
3 year statute of limitations expires on legal action for unsecured credit debt.” (Id.)
In his April 15, 2019 SCA, Applicant did not mention the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($4,501).
(Item  2)  For  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  ($4,180),  he  said  it  resulted  from  “failure  to  pay
unsecured credit card during dispute with separated spouse,” and it was being resolved
through garnishment of  his  wages.  (Id. at 38).  The  garnishment  was  15  percent  of  his
wages,  and  the  final payment  was  scheduled for May  30,  2019. (Id. at  39) Applicant’s
September 24, 2019 credit report, the most recent credit report of record, indicates the
balance is $184, and the date of last payment is June 2019. (Item 5) On July 30, 2019,
Applicant provided proof to an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that
his garnishment was successfully completed, and the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e was resolved.
(Item 3)
In the summary of Applicant’s July 29, 2019 OPM personal subject interview (PSI),
he said that he separated from his spouse in September 2015. (Item 3 at 2) His spouse
did not work outside their home. (Id.) Applicant agreed to pay his spouse $4,000 monthly,
and she agreed to pay their mortgage and utilities, and to take care of their children. (Id.)
Applicant moved to a separate residence. (Id.) Applicant and his spouse used credit cards
to  fund  any  shortfalls  in  their  income.  (Id.)  In  July  2016,  Applicant’s  son  had  a  brain
aneurism and stroke. (Id.) His son had surgery, and he received extensive rehabilitation.
(Id.) Applicant had good medical coverage; however, these medical problems resulted in
additional financial problems.  (Id.)  For  a time,  he borrowed from  his  401(k)  account  to
maintain his credit cards and pay his support obligation. (Id.) In March 2017, he “stopped
making regular payments on his credit cards since they were unsecured and would not
impact on meeting his and his family’s monthly living expenses.” (Id.)
After  March  2017,  Applicant  tried  to  make  smaller  payments  to  the  credit  card
companies.  (Item  3  at  2)  He  tried  to  arrange  payment  plans.  (Id.)  The  credit  card
companies were unwilling to work with him, and he was unable to establish affordable
payment  plans.  (Id.  at  2-5)  He  said  that  after  he  completed  the  garnishment,  and  the
statute of limitations ends the risk of a lawsuit to collect the debts, he planned to attempt
to  establish  payment  plans  to  resolve  his  debts.  (Id.  at  5)  He  did  not  provide  any
documentation showing attempts to make payments or to establish payment plans.
In  Applicant’s  July  29,  2019  OPM  PSI,  Applicant  said  his  monthly  net  income,
including 40 percent disability from the Department of Veterans Affairs and a contribution
from  his  cohabitant,  was  $9,247.  (Id.  at  5)  His  total  monthly  expenses  included  the
payment of $4,000 to his spouse, but did not include his garnishment to pay the debt in
SOR ¶ 1.e, and totaled $7,929. (Id. at 5-6) His net monthly remainder was $1,318. (Id. at
6) In June 2019, he completed paying the $1,200 monthly garnishment to address the
debt in SOR ¶ 1.e. (Id. at 3, 5-6) While the garnishment was ongoing, he reduced his
support  payments  to  his  spouse  by  $300  monthly,  and  then  after  the  garnishment,  he
provided $4,300 to her monthly until the $300 deduction was repaid. (Id.)
In  the  FORM,  Department  Counsel  noted  the  absence  of  corroborating  or
supporting  documentation  of  resolution  of  the  SOR  debts.  Aside  from  Applicant’s
uncorroborated  statements,  there  is  no  documentary  evidence  that  Applicant  paid,
arranged to pay, settled, compromised, or otherwise resolved any of the SOR debts. The
record lacks corroborating or substantiating documentation and detailed explanations of
the  causes  for  his  financial  problems  and  other  mitigating  information.  The  FORM
informed Applicant that he had 30 days from the receipt of the FORM “in which to submit
a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation,
or explanation, as appropriate. If you do not file any objections or submit any additional
information . . . your case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination
based solely” on the evidence set forth in this FORM. (FORM at 4 (emphasis added)) He
did not respond to the FORM.
