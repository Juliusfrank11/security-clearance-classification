Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since May 2017. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from
1986  until  he  retired  with  an  honorable  discharge  in  2008.  He  deployed  to  Iraq  from
2004  to 2005.  He  has  a  bachelor’s degree  that  he  earned  in  2004.  He  is married  with
two adult children. (Items 2, 3)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  problems.  He  was  granted  a  security
clearance in 2007, with a warning that “failure to resolve [his] delinquent debts or other
subsequent  unfavorable  information  may  result  in  the  suspension  of  [his]  security
clearance.”1  He  was  also  “strongly  advised  to  avoid  any  further  incidents  of  failure  to
pay  debts  that  [he]  legally  incurred.”  The  memorandum  with  the  warning  notice  is
addressed  to  Applicant  through  his  command,  but  there  is  no  documentation  in
evidence that Applicant acknowledged receipt of the memorandum. (Items 4, 9)
Applicant  attributed  his  recent  financial  problems  to  a  period  of  unemployment
from  November  2015  to  May  2016.  He  had  his  military  retirement,  unemployment
compensation,  and  a  part-time  job  officiating  at  sporting  events,  but  he  was  unable  to
pay all his bills. (Items 2, 3; AE A)
The SOR  alleges  a  mortgage  loan  that  was  $26,293  past  due,  with  a  $354,777
balance; a $23,159 charged-off auto loan; nine miscellaneous  delinquent debts; and a
Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. Three of the delinquent debts, SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.i, and 1.j, are
duplicate  accounts.  When  two  of  the  duplicate  accounts  are  eliminated  from  the  nine
delinquent debts, there are seven miscellaneous debts totaling about $4,750. Applicant
admitted owing all the financial obligations.
Applicant  stated  during  his  February  2019  background  interview  that  he  was
working  on  a  modification  to  his  mortgage  loan.  The  October  2017  credit  report
indicates the loan was $19,015 past due, with a $336,444 balance, and in foreclosure. It
also  indicates  that  Applicant  had  made  arrangements  with  the  lender  to  make  partial
payments.  The  April  2019  credit  report  indicates  the  loan  had  been  modified  under  a
federal government plan. However, it also indicates that the loan was $26,293 past due,
with a $354,777 balance, and a date of last action of March 2018. The May 2020 credit
report indicates the loan was $44,712 past due, with a $370,148 balance, and a date of
last payment of September 2018. (Items 3, 5-7)
Applicant was current on the auto loan in 2017. The October 2017 credit report
indicates  the  loan  was  opened  in  September  2014  for  74  months  at  $674  per  month.
The high credit was $28,445, and the balance was $22,318. The April 2019 credit report
indicates the loan was charged off with a high credit of $20,893 and a $23,159 balance.
The  date  of  last  action  was  June  2018.  The  May  2020  credit  report indicates  the  loan
1 The SOR did not allege financial issues in 2007. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will not be
used  for  disqualification  purposes.  It  may  be  considered  when  assessing  Applicant’s  overall  financial
situation, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in the whole-person analysis.
was  charged  off  for  $20,893.  It  lists  an  actual  payment  of  $674,  and  a  date  of  last
payment of August 2019. The balance on the loan was $20,227. (Items 5-7)
Applicant  filed  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  case  in  March  2019.  The  case  was
dismissed the same month for failure to file all the required documents. Applicant stated
that he did not continue the bankruptcy process because he felt that he could address
his finances on his own. He indicated that his credit score does not  determine the kind
of person he is and how hard he worked to provide for his family.  He asserted that he
planned to pay his debts, and that he was on track to restore his credit score. He did not
indicate  what  he  was  doing  to  correct  his  financial  issues.  Some  of  the  debts  are  not
listed  on  the  most  recent  credit  reports.  Except  for  the  limited  payments  that  are
gleaned from the credit reports and discussed above, there is no evidence of any actual
payments toward the debts alleged in the SOR. (Item 5-8; AE A)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
July 2017. He did not report any adverse information under the financial questions. He
denied  intentionally  providing  false  information  about  his  finances.  He  stated  that  his
wife handled the family’s finances, and with the exception of the mortgage loan, he was
unaware that the debts alleged in the SOR were delinquent. He stated that he did not
think about the mortgage loan when he completed the SF 86. (Items 2, 3)
