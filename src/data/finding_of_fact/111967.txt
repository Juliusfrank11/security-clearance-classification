In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d,
and 1.e, and denies all remaining SOR allegations.
Applicant  is  a  29-year-old  employee  of  a  DOD  contractor  who  seeks  a  security
clearance. This is his first time applying for a security clearance. He has been employed
with  his  current employer  since March 2020.  He  has a  high school diploma and some
technical school credits. He lives with his girlfriend and has an eight-year-old daughter
from a prior relationship. He has never been married. (Tr.9; Gov 1) (Note: The facts in
this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, or locations
in  order  to  protect  Applicant  and  his  family’s  privacy.  The  cited  sources  contain  more
specific information.)
Guideline H – Drug Involvement
Under the drug involvement concern, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana
with  varying  frequency  from  January  2014  to  July  2016.  (SOR  ¶  1.a:  Gov  1  at  43-44;
Gov  2  at  8)  He  is  alleged  to  have  purchased  and  distributed  marijuana  between
January 2014 and July 2018. (SOR ¶ 1.b: Gov 2 at 8)  It is alleged that Applicant told
the  investigator  conducting his  background  investigation that  he intends to continue to
purchase  and  distribute  marijuana.  (SOR  ¶  1.c:  Gov  2 at  8)  Applicant  was  arrested  in
October 2014 and charged with possession of marijuana. (SOR ¶ 1.d: Gov 1 at 40-41;
Gov  2  at  7;  Gov  3; Gov  5).  Finally,  Applicant  was  arrested  in  July  2016  and  charged
with  possession  of  marijuana.  (Gov  1  at  41-42;  Gov  2  at  7;  Gov  4;  Gov  5).  Applicant
pled  guilty  to  both  offenses.  Applicant  was  issued  a  citation  for  possession  of
marijuana, a misdemeanor offense, during both incidents. He was not arrested.
The  police  officer  involved  in  the  October  31,  2014,  incident  summarized  the
events leading to Applicant’s citation for possession of marijuana in  a police report. He
stopped a car driven by Applicant’s girlfriend for speeding. Applicant was a passenger in
the car. Once the window was rolled down, the police officer noticed a strong smell of
fresh  marijuana  coming  within  the  vehicle.  He  told  Applicant  and  his  girlfriend  that  he
was going to search the car for marijuana and asked them to step out of the car.  Fresh
marijuana  wrapped  in  white  paper  was  discovered  in  an  open  compartment  by  the
dashboard. Five partially smoked marijuana cigarettes were found inside the ash tray by
the  dashboard.  Applicant  and  his  girlfriend  were  separately  read  their  Miranda  rights.
Applicant’s  girlfriend  said  that  she  does  not  smoke  marijuana  but  Applicant  does  and
smokes in the car with his friends. She said all of the marijuana in the car belonged to
Applicant. After being read his rights, Applicant admitted that all of the marijuana in the
car belonged to him. He was issued a summons for possession of marijuana. (Gov 3 at
7)
The  police  report  for  the  July  7,  2016,  indicated  that  this  incident  began  when
Applicant  pulled  into  a  convenience  store.  When  he  walked  into  the  store,  a  police
officer  who  was  outside  the  convenience  store  near  Applicant’s  car  smelled  a  strong
odor  of  marijuana  coming  from  Applicant’s  car.  When  Applicant  exited  the  store,  the
officers  asked  Applicant  if  the  car  belonged  to  him.  They  told  him  that  they  smelled  a
strong smell of marijuana coming from his car. They told him they were going to search
his  car  based  on  probable  cause.  Applicant  became  upset  and  told  them  they  did  not
have  probable  cause  to  search  the  car.  The  car  was  searched  and  a  plastic  bag  of
green  leafy  plant  material  was  found  in  the  center  console.  The  green  leafy  plant
material tested positive as marijuana. The marijuana was confiscated and Applicant was
issued a summons for possession of marijuana. (Gov 4 at 6-7)
In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d
and 1.e. He clarifies his answer to SOR ¶ 1.a by indicating he used marijuana off and
on between 2014 and 2015. He denies the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c because
he  claims  he  never  distributed  marijuana  and  “would  never  say  a  statement  like  that.”
(Response to SOR, dated January 7, 2020)
Personal Conduct
Under  the  Personal  Conduct  Concern,  the  SOR  cross  alleges  the  allegations
listed under the Guideline H, Drug Involvement Concern.  In addition, the SOR alleges
under  the  Personal  Conduct  Concern  that  Applicant  falsified  material  facts  during  his
background investigation interview on July 18, 2018; by stating:
(SOR ¶ 2.b)  that he used marijuana from January 2014 to February 2014,
when he used marijuana at least from January 2014 to July 2016;
(SOR ¶ 2.c) that he was not using marijuana when he was cited for
possession of marijuana in October 2014; and
(SOR ¶ 2.d) that he was not using marijuana when he was cited for
possession of marijuana in July 2016.
for
On  April  30,  2018,  Applicant  submitted  an  electronic  questionnaire
investigations  processing  (e-QIP)  also  known  as  a  security  clearance  application.  In
response to questions in Section 22, Applicant listed his two citations for possession of
marijuana  in  2014  and  2016.  In  response  to  questions  in  Section  23  –  Illegal  Use  of
Drugs  or  Drug  Activity,  Applicant  estimated  that  he  used  marijuana  between  January
2014 and July 2016, in the amount of “7-10 times total.” (Gov 1, sections 22 and 23, at
40-44)
On  July  18,  2018,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  an  investigator  who  was
investigator
conducting  his  security  clearance  background
subsequently  prepared  an  unsworn  summary  of  the  interview.  Regarding  his  October
2014 arrest for possession of marijuana, Applicant told the investigator that he claimed
the  marijuana  in  the  car  was  his  to  protect  his  girlfriend.  Applicant  also  said  the
marijuana  joints  were  left  behind  in  the  car  by  someone  else.  During  his  July  2016
investigation.  The
citation  for  misdemeanor  possession  of  marijuana,  Applicant  again  claimed  the
marijuana  found  in  his  car  did  not  belong  to  him.  He  purchased  the  marijuana  for  a
family member. (Tr. 41-42Gov 2 at 6-7)
Applicant told the investigator that he smoked marijuana between January 2014
and February 2014, on average of one to two times per week. He does not know why
he  listed  the  last  date  of  marijuana  use  on  paperwork  as  July  2016.  He  told  the
investigator  that  he  occasionally  purchased  marijuana  for  friends  and  family  members
when requested. He is aware that it is illegal to purchase and possess marijuana in the
state where he resides. He told the investigator that he intends to continue to purchase
marijuana for family and friends when requested.  (Gov 2 at 8)
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Department Counsel sent Applicant
a set of interrogatories. The interrogatories attached a summary of Applicant’s July 18,
2018, interview with the investigator conducting his background investigation. Applicant
was told to read the summary of the interview. He was given an opportunity to point out
any  inaccuracies  in  the  summary  of  the  interview.  Applicant  acknowledged  that  the
summary  of  the  interview  was  accurate.  He  swore  (or  affirmed)  that  he  read  the
enclosed  report  of  his  July  18,  2018  interview  and  that  he  found  the  report  to  be
accurate  or  that  he  amended  the  report  to  make  it  accurate.  He  signed  the  document
before a notary on October 2, 2019. (Gov 2)
During  the   hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  never  distributed   marijuana.  He
said   he used marijuana “on and off” from 2014   to 2015.  He   again stated that when he
was charged with possession of  marijuana  in  2016,  the marijuana was not his. He  was
charged  because   it  was  found   in   his  car.   (Tr.   19)   Applicant   also  admitted  during  the
hearing  that  he  used  marijuana  during  the  2014  arrest  for  marijuana   possession.  He
admitted that marijuana was his and not his girlfriend’s.  (Tr. 44-46)
Regarding his July 2016 arrest for marijuana possession, Applicant testified that
he  did  not  use  marijuana  in  2016.  He  claims  he  was  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana  because  no  one  else  admitted  ownership  of  the  marijuana.  He  has
occasionally  purchased  a  small  amount  of  marijuana  for  a  family  member.  He  did  not
believe  that  purchasing  marijuana  for  a  family  member  was  considered  marijuana
distribution. At the hearing, Applicant claimed the only time he purchased marijuana for
a family member was in July 2016. He purchased about $20 worth for his cousin. (Tr.
45-49, 52)
Later  in  the  hearing,  Applicant  claimed  that  he  did  not  use  marijuana  in  2015.
Applicant testified that his last day of marijuana use was in October 2014. He has not
associated  with  people  using  marijuana  for  several  years.  His  marijuana  use  was
recreational. He does not have a drug problem. (Tr. 51-54)

SOR  alleged  11  delinquent  accounts  that  were  placed  for  collection,  an  approximate
total balance of $13,149. This was, in large part, the result of low-paying jobs. The SOR

earned about $41,000 a year. His current annual income is $44,000. (Tr. 22, 27) In early
2018,  Applicant  began  working  with  a  credit  counseling  group  to  help  him  repair  his
credit  and  to  settle  accounts.  He  stopped  working  with  them  a  few  months  before  the
hearing because he felt they were working too slowly. He decided to pay off the debts
on his own. (Tr. 27-29; Gov 2 at 8). Applicant said all of his debts were paid off.  The
record was held open after the hearing to provide Applicant the opportunity to provide a
copy of his agreement with the credit repair firm; a copy of his budget, a copy of receipts
