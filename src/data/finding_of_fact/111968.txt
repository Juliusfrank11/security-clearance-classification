Applicant is 49 years old. He has been married since 2003, and has two teenage
children. In 1999, he received an associate’s degree. From 2005 until 2014, he worked
for a defense contractor. He was self-employed from 2014 until April 2016, when he went
back to work for his former employer as a designer/drafter. (Item 4; Item 5, AE A)
The SOR alleges two consumer debts totaling $51,238. In his answer to the SOR,
Applicant admitted the $50,757 home equity line of credit (HELOC) and denied the $481
credit card debt. He provided explanations and documentation. (Item 3)
In June 2006, Applicant purchased a home and opened a HELOC to make repairs
to  the  house.  He  made  interest-only  payments  toward  the  HELOC  until  approximately
September  2015,  when  the  account  was  sold  to  another  creditor.  The  new  creditor
refused  payments,  and  Applicant  was  told  by  the  original  creditor  to  wait  to  make
payments  until  he  was  contacted  by  the  new  creditor.  The  debt  subsequently  became
delinquent, and in July 2016, the HELOC was charged off in the amount of $51,399. (Item
5 at 1-2; Item 6 at 3; AE A)
On January 30, 2020, Applicant and his wife entered into a forbearance agreement
to  make  $200  monthly  payments  from  January  30,  2020  through  December  30,  2020,
toward  the  HELOC  debt.  His  credit  reports  reflect  that  the  balance  was  reduced  from
$51,399 in January 2017 to $50,757 in July 2019 and to $50,557 in April 2020. These
balances  demonstrate  that  he  made  additional  payments  before  the  2020  payment
agreement. In his May 2020 response to the FORM, Applicant provided documentation
that he made five timely $200 payments between January and May 2020, in accordance
with the agreement. (Item 3, Item 6, Item 7, Item 8, AE B)
Applicant provided proof that he paid in full the $481 credit card debt in January
2020,  and  his  most  recent  credit  bureau  report  reflects  that  it  has  been  resolved.  It
appears that he made payments toward this debt between January 2017 and July 2019
as the delinquent amount decreased from $581 to $481. The account originally became
delinquent because Applicant was under the impression that his wife had paid the debt in
a timely manner. (Item 3; Item 5 at 1; Item 6 at 3; Item 8 at 2)
Applicant’s April 2020 credit bureau report reflects no new delinquent debts. There
is no record evidence of credit counseling. (Item 8)
