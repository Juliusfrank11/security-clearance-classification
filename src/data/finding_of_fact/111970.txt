Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since August 2018. He served in the U.S. military from 1989 until
he was honorably discharged in 1999. He is married for the second time. He has three
adult children. (Items 3, 4)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  problems,  including  unpaid  federal  income
taxes, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, repossessed vehicles, and delinquent debts. He
attributed  his  problems  primarily  to  maintaining  two  households  while  he  worked  in  a
different state than his wife, leaving a good-paying job to move to another state to help
his  daughter  who  was  suffering  from  depression,  and  helping  his  mother  and  other
family members financially. He moved from State A to State B in 2014 for a better job,
while his family remained in State A. He moved back to State A to help his daughter in
2016. (Items 2-8)
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant’s  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  case;  approximately
$26,000 in back federal income taxes; and 11 delinquent debts totaling about $46,000.
Applicant admitted all the allegations except the delinquent debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.i
($697),  1.j  ($525),  and  1.l  ($155),  which  he  asserted  were  paid.  The  three  disputed
debts are listed on the most recent credit report in evidence, which was obtained in May
2019. Applicant did not submit any documentation to corroborate his statements that the
debts were paid. (Items 2, 7, 8)
Applicant  and  his  wife  filed  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  case  in  December  2014.
Under  Schedule  D,  Creditors  Holding  Secured  Claims,  the  petition  listed  $213,195  in
secured  claims,  which  included  a  mortgage  loan  and  four  vehicle  loans.  Under
Schedule  E,  Creditors  Holding  Unsecured  Priority  Claims,  the  petition  listed  debts  of
$26,000  to  the  IRS  for  back  taxes  and  $3,300  in  attorney’s  fees.  The  petition  listed
debts  totaling  $50,881  under  Schedule  F,  Creditors  Holding  Unsecured  Nonpriority
Claims.  The  IRS  filed  claims  totaling  about  $42,000  against  the  bankruptcy  for  back
taxes,  penalties,  and  interest.  The  IRS  claimed  Applicant’s  wife  owed  $2,989  for  tax
years 2006 and 2007, and Applicant owed the remainder for tax years 2008 and 2010
through 2013. (Items 2-8)
The Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was dismissed in April 2016 for failure to make
the plan payments. Applicant and his wife paid a total of $24,036 into the plan, but none
of  the  taxes  or  other  unsecured  debts  were  paid.  The  trustee  and  Applicant’s
bankruptcy  attorney  received $5,388.  The  remainder  was  paid to  secured claims  such
as the mortgage arrearage ($5,118) and a vehicle loan ($13,529). (Items 2-5)
Applicant’s bankruptcy petition indicated that he was on a payment plan with the
IRS. (Item 5) He reported his bankruptcy, tax issues, and delinquent debts on an August
2018  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86).  He  wrote  the  following  as
the  reason  for  the  tax  problems:  “Change  in  employment  due  to  family  issues.  My
marriage was in shambles so we moved back to [State A] and the reduction in income
caused me to default on my installment plan with the IRS.” (Item 3)
Applicant  told  the  background  investigator  in  November  2018  that  he  was  on  a
$700  per  month  installment  plan  with  the  IRS,  and  the  payments  were  automatically
deducted from his bank account. In his December 2019 response to the SOR, he wrote
that he had been on a monthly “installment plan for 12 months and [had] not missed a
payment.” (Items 2, 4)
Applicant received financial counseling as a requirement of his bankruptcy. (Item
5)  He  indicated  in  his  response  to  the  SOR  that  he  was  working  with  several  of  his
creditors  on  settlements.  He  did  not  provide  any  corroborating  documents  about  his
taxes or his debts, and he did not respond to the FORM.
