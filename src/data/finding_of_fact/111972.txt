Applicant is a 58-year-old systems engineer for a defense contractor who seeks
a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are
incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant  married  in  June  1996  and  divorced  in  May  2009.  (Items  3-4)  He  has
three children from this marriage (ages 20, 17, and 15). He remarried in October 2012
and has five stepchildren from this marriage (ages 39, 28, 18, 15, and 12). (Items 3-4)
Applicant  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  August  2005.  Applicant  reported  no  military
service.  (Items  3-4)  Since  February  2007,  Applicant  has  been  employed  as  a
multidiscipline system engineer lead by his current defense contractor. (Items 3 and 4)
He  reported  no  prior  employment,  and  he  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  1990.
(Item 4).
Applicant’s finances
In December 2012, Applicant incurred a $52,063 federal tax lien. (Items 5-7) He
disputes the merits of this lien that covers delinquent taxes owed on a $3,000 charitable
contribution  he  made  to  his  church  in  2003  with  funds  withdrawn  from  his  401(k)
retirement  account.  (Item  7)    The  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  declined  to  credit
Applicant with a non-taxable donation because it found the church beneficiary to be not
properly structured for eligibility under Title 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)3) to receive non-taxable
donations.  (Item 7)
Section  501(c)(3)  tax  exemptions  apply  to  entities  that  are  organized  and
operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes.
Where  applicable,  the  IRS  provides  a  deduction  for  federal  income  tax  purposes  for
some  donors  who  make  charitable  contributions.  Being  denied  a  tax  exemption  for
reasons not fully detailed by Applicant, he has continued to dispute the IRS’s declination
to  treat  his  donation  as  a  non-taxable  contribution  and  claims  enforcement  of  the  lien
will  expire  in  August  2020.  (Item  2)  Currently,  the  aggregate  of  Applicant’s  federal  tax
liability is $52,063, inclusive of cumulative penalties and interest. (Items 5-7)
Applicant recently engaged a tax consultant to address his incurred 2012 tax lien.
(Items 2 and 7) To date, he has reported no success  with his IRS negotiations and has
provided  no  documentation  of  his  ongoing  efforts  to  address  and  resolve  the  tax  lien
issue. Because of his failure to provide any supporting documentation of his resolution
efforts with the IRS, little debt resolution credit can be extended to Applicant. So, while
he  remains  committed  to  addressing  the  documented  tax  lien,  he  has  provided  no
updates on his IRS negotiations, or evidence of financial counseling or budgeting.
E-QIP omissions
Asked to complete an e-QIP in June 2017, Applicant omitted the federal tax lien
entered against him in 2012 in the space provided in section 26 of the e-QIP. (Item 3)
He  attributed  his  omission  to  his  misunderstanding  the  question  in  the  face  of  his
ongoing  dispute  with  the  IRS  over  his  church’s  entitlement  to  501(c)(3)  status.
Previously,  he  omitted  any  information  about  tax  delinquencies  in  the  e-QIP  he
completed  in  August  2007  for  a  public  trust  position.  (Item  4)  Applicant  provided  no
explanations for why he omitted this tax information in both e-QIPs.
What  communications  Applicant  exchanged  with  the  IRS  between  2003  and
2012 is unclear. For he provided no details of any disputes he initiated with the IRS over
his church donation in 2003, or why he elected to omit his $3,000 federal tax debt in the
e-QIP  he  completed  in  2007.  Whether  he  was  ever  interviewed  by  an  OPM  agent
following  his  submission  of  his  2007  e-QIP  is  also  unclear.  Without  more  information
from Applicant as to why he omitted (a) the $3,000 tax debt he incurred with the IRS in
his 2007 e-QIP (with explanations or comments if disputed) and (b) the ensuing tax lien
entered  against  him  in  2012  in  his  2017  e-QIP  (with  explanations  or  comments  if
disputed), drawn inferences of candor lapses cannot be averted.
When questioned about any tax liens and delinquencies by an investigator from
the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  in  October  2018,  Applicant  voluntarily
acknowledged  the  2012  tax  lien  without  any  prior  confronting.  In  his  interview,  he
provided detailed information about the origins of the tax imposition in 2003 and ensuing
tax lien entered against him in 2012 with added penalties and interest. (Item 7) His OPM
disclosures, while voluntary and by all evidentiary accounts made in good-faith, did not
include  any  explanations  for  why  he  omitted  the  tax  information  in  both  of  his  prior  e-
QIPs.
Afforded an opportunity to explain any ongoing tax dispute with the IRS over his
unresolved  federal  tax  lie  in  the  answers  to  interrogatories  he  submitted  in  July  2019,
Applicant  acknowledged  anew  the  delinquent  $52,063  tax  lien  and  confirmed  the  lien
remained unaddressed and unsatisfied. (Item 5)  Claiming that IRS lien enforcement will
expire in August 2020 (Item 2), he offered no other tangible basis for disputing the lien
or omitting it from his 2017 e-QIP.
