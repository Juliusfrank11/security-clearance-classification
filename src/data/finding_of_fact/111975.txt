Under  Guideline  F,  the  Government  alleged  that  in April  2003,  Applicant  filed  a
Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition and was discharged of debts totaling $41,230 in August
2003 (SOR 1.k). The Government also alleged that Applicant owed $26,001 for ten past-
due or delinquent debts (SOR 1.a – 1.j).
Under  Guideline  E,  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately  omitted
from his August 2018 e-QIP the debts alleged in SOR 1.a – 1.j (SOR 2.c); and that during
his PSIs on December 21 and 28, 2018, he falsely denied owing any delinquent debts
until he was confronted with corroborating information about those debts (SOR 2.d).
Also under Guideline E, the Government alleged that Applicant deliberately made
a  false  statement  when  he  failed  to  disclose  in  his  e-QIP  that,  in  April  2014,  he  was
suspended  from  work  for  two  weeks  due  to  misconduct  (SOR  2.a).  Finally,  the
Government  alleged  Applicant  made  another  false  statement  when,  after  failing  to
disclose his 2014 suspension in his e-QIP, he failed to disclose it during his December
21, 2018 PSI; and that it was not until he was confronted during a May 23, 2019 PSI that
that he disclosed the suspension. (SOR 2.b).
In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  without
comment.  In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by  Applicant’s  admissions,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 49 years old and has been employed in an information technology (IT)
position  by  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has  worked  since  October  2019.  His
previous  employer,  for  whom  he  worked  between  August  2018  and  October  2019,
sponsored  his  submission  of  an  e-QIP  in  August  2018,  and  his  current  job  requires
eligibility for access to classified information. In 1997, he earned a bachelor’s degree in
electrical engineering, and he has earned several IT certifications. (GX 1; Tr. 31)
Applicant was married in May 2003, but divorced in May 2008. He has no children,
and he currently rents a room at his brother’s house for $1,000 a month. Shortly before
he married, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in which he declared $41,230
in unsecured debts against $3,820 in assets. Applicant testified he accrued those unpaid
debts  by  age  31  because  he  was  “young  and  reckless.”  Credit  reports  obtained  by
government  investigators  and  adjudicators  in  October  2018  and  August  2019,
respectively,  list  the  debts  alleged  at  SOR  1.a  –  1.j.  Those  debts  became  delinquent
between 2012 and 2018. (GX 3; GX 4; GX 6; Tr. 71 – 72, 89 – 90)
Applicant first received a security clearance in 1998 for defense contractor work at
a military installation. He testified that before submitting his most recent e-QIP, Applicant
had  submitted  as  many  as  ten  security  clearance  applications,  and  that  he  views  a
security clearance to be “as good as gold” and “a license to make money.” Since 1998,
he has worked for multiple defense contractors in positions that required either a security
clearance or eligibility for a public trust position. Between 2009 and 2014, he worked as
a  government  employee  for  a  federal  agency.  That  job  required  he  meet  certain
production quotas during each performance appraisal period. In April 2014, Applicant was
suspended  for  two  weeks  for  violating  workplace  policies,  including  failing  to  meet  his
quotas and keeping a work schedule outside of prescribed workday hours. Applicant did
not believe he was violating agency rules by working late evening to early morning hours;
however, before being suspended he was counseled about the need to adhere to a core
workhours policy. He also was counseled about his failure to meet his production goals.
(Answer; GX 2; Tr. 32, 36 – 39, 44 – 46, 72, 85 – 86)
In Section 26 (Financial Record) of his e-QIP, Applicant did not disclose any of the
debts alleged in SOR 1.a –  1.j. He also did not disclose, as required by e-QIP Section
13C  (Employment  Record),  that  he  was  suspended  for  two  weeks  from  his  federal
employment in April 2014. During his background investigation, he was interviewed on
December 21, 2018. The investigator conducting the interview reviewed with Applicant
the  answers  on  his  e-QIP  and  Applicant  confirmed,  in  relevant  part,  that  his  negative
answers in Sections 26 and 13C were correct. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2)
On  December  28,  2018,  Applicant  was  re-interviewed  about  his  finances.  The
investigator  initially  asked  Applicant  if  he  had  any  delinquent  debts,  and  Applicant
answered “no.” The investigator then confronted Applicant with credit report information
that documented several delinquent or past-due debts, including those listed in the SOR.
Applicant claimed he omitted the debts from his e-QIP because  of a “mental lapse.”  At
his hearing, he testified that he did not disclose his debts because either he already had
paid  some  of  his  debts  on  his  own  or  he  was  repaying  the  rest  through  a  debt
management plan (DMP) in which he had enrolled before he submitted the e-QIP. (GX 2;
GX 3; Tr. 47 – 49, 69 – 71, 74 – 76)
Section  13C  of  the  e-QIP  requires  disclosure  of  information  about  adverse
workplace actions in the preceding seven years; specifically, whether an applicant was
fired, quit a job after being told he would be fired, left a job by mutual agreement after
allegations of misconduct or notice of poor  job performance, or had received a written
warning, official reprimand, suspended or otherwise disciplined for misconduct. Applicant
answered “no” to this inquiry rather than list the two-week suspension discussed above.
In listing a reason for his departure from his federal employment in 2014, he stated he
resigned. During both of his December PSIs, Applicant failed to disclose his suspension
while  reviewing  his  negative  answers  in  Section  13C.  He  again  was  interviewed  by  a
government  investigator  on  May  23,  2019,  and  he  initially  denied  any  adverse
employment history. After then being confronted with information about his suspension,
he acknowledged the incident and provided details about what had occurred. During the
May 2019 PSI, he did not provide any explanation about why he did not list the suspension
in his e-QIP or why he did not disclose the information during either of his December 2018
interviews. At his hearing, he acknowledged he left his government job in July 2014 by
mutual agreement under adverse circumstances related to the underlying causes of his
suspension. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 36 – 43, 93 – 94)
As to Applicant’s debts, during his December 28 interview, he stated that he fell
behind on his debts after being hospitalized. At his hearing, Applicant described being ill
while working for the federal government. He testified that he suffered from unspecified
intestinal problems which caused him to take time off without pay under the Family and
Medical Leave Act (FMLA). However, he did not provide more detailed information about
his  illness  or  how  it  impacted  his  finances.  He  has  stated  that  he  was  unable  to  work
during  his  illness;  however,  available  information  shows  that  he  has  been  consistently
employed, albeit at varying income levels, since at least 1998. Applicant averred that he
has paid several of his debts and that he has been repaying others through the DMP in
which he enrolled just after he submitted his e-QIP in August 2018. A recent credit report
he presented at hearing shows many of his debts have been paid and closed; however,
they  were  closed  by  the  creditor.  The  record  contains  no  information  directly  showing
actual  payments  by  Applicant  to  resolve  those  debts.  Put  another  way,  the  fact  that  a
credit  report  may  list  an  account  as  paid  does  not  mean  Applicant  resolved  the  debt.
Taken together with the Government’s credit reports, it appears many of Applicant’s debts
were sold to collection agencies and may still be his responsibility. The question of proof
of  payment  or  resolution  was  raised  at  the  hearing  and  Applicant  averred  he  could
document  his  claims  that  many of  his  debts  had been  paid.  Despite  having extra time
after the hearing to provide that information, Applicant has not presented anything further
to corroborate his claims. (Answer; GX 3 – 5; AX A; AX B; Tr. 48 – 65, 67, 75 – 76, 92 –
