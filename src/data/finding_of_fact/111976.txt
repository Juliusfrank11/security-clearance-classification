Applicant’s  SOR  response  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  Applicant
also  provided  extenuating  and  mitigating  information.  Applicant’s  admissions  are
accepted as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of
record, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  42-year-old  information  technology  specialist  employed  by  the
same  defense  contractor  since  February  2016.  (Tr.  6-7,  38;  AE  V  at  1)  He  has
not  been unemployed  during  the  previous  five  years.  (Tr.  8)  He  has  never  served  in
the military. (Tr. 7) He has never married, and he does not have any children. (Tr. 7)
In  1995,  Applicant  graduated  from  high  school.  (Tr.  6)  In  2000,  he  received
two bachelor’s degrees, one in music education and one in music performance. (Tr. 8,
22-23; AE T; AE V at 4) In 2002, he received a master’s degree in music. (Tr. 8, 27-28;
AE T; AE V at 4) In 2011, he received a doctorate degree in musical arts (DMA). (Tr. 8;
AE T; AE V at 4)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s SOR alleges 23 student loan debts totaling $435,830 that were placed
for collection in the following amounts: 1.a ($70,373); 1.b ($62,616); 1.c ($58,320); 1.d
($56,786);  1.e  ($38,207);  1.f  ($15,394);  1.g  ($14,985);  1.h  ($10,198);  1.i  ($10,198);  1.j
($8,808); 1.k ($7,198); 1.l ($5,482); 1.m ($5,165); 1.n ($4,580); 1.o ($4,356); 1.p ($4,057);
1.q ($3,267); 1.r ($2,999); 1.t ($12,379); 1.u ($12,379); 1.v ($2,617); 1.w ($20,156); and
1.x  ($5,310).  The  creditor  for  the  first  18  SOR  debts  is  the  Department  of  Education
(DOE),  and the  creditor for the  last  five SOR debts  is  a bank.  Applicant  said  he owed
more than $435,000 to his student loan creditors. (AE V at 1)
SOR  ¶  1.s  alleges  a  telecommunications  debt  placed  for  collection  for  $111.
Applicant believes the telecommunications bill was erroneous. (AE F) Applicant’s most
recent credit report of record was dated February 14, 2020, and it does not include the
telecommunications debt. (GE 4)
After  receiving  his  DMA  degree  in  2011,  Applicant  had  difficulty  finding
employment in music that paid enough for him to address his student loans. (Tr. 33-34)
He did not maintain contact with his creditors because he could not afford payments. (Tr.
34-35)  Between  2011  and  2016,  he  may  have  submitted  one  or  more  requests  for
hardship  deferments.  (Tr.  40-41)  He  may  have  contacted  some  of  his  student  loan
creditors around 2016. (Tr. 39) He had difficulty assessing and reconciling the various
payment options. (Tr. 39-40) Around 2017, he entered a rehabilitation program for five of
his student loans. (Tr. 36; AE B) He claimed he did not realize his rehabilitation program
did not include all of his student loans. (Tr. 37) He said he was confused because he was
working with multiple websites and creditors. (Tr. 37) Some of his pay at some point was
being garnished to pay his student loans. (Tr. 38)
On  October  29,  2018,  an  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  investigator
interviewed Applicant about his delinquent student loans. (GE 5) Applicant estimated his
student loan debts totaled $442,000. (GE 5) Prior to October 2018, he had been paying
his  creditors  about  $20  each  month  for  nine  months.  (GE  5)  He  said  he  planned  to
consolidate his loans and then arrange a payment plan. (GE 5)
In his December 27, 2019 SOR response, Applicant said, “The [student] loans are
in the process of consolidation and establish[ment] of repayment plan through Navient,
the  recommended  option  at  the  time  I  completed  repayment  forms  on  the  federal
government  student  loans  website.”  (HE  3)  He  did  not  provide  a  copy  of  the
documentation showing his application for consolidation or to establish a repayment plan.
At his hearing, Applicant provided a student loan account summary for five student
loans being collected by ECMC showing payments for the period from October 12, 2017,
to November 20, 2018. He said the five student loans were not included in the student
loans listed on the SOR, and ECMC is not a creditor on his SOR. (Tr. 59) This summary
was printed on March 13, 2020. (AE B) When the five accounts were created on October
12, 2017, the principal totaled $41,872 for the five student loans in the following amounts:
$2,074; $4,208; $9,809; $9,809; and $15,972. (AE B at 5) He made $5 monthly payments
(AE  B  at  4)
from February to October 2018. (AE B) In February 2018, his employer made two $268
payments.
“Lender/School”  made
In  November  2018,
“Rehabilitation/Repurchase  Payment[s]  totaling  $49,572  as  follows:  $18,909;  $4,982;
$2,455;  $11,613;  and  $11,613.  (AE  B  at  1)  Applicant  did  not  provide  documentation
showing the current status of the five student loan debts. He did not know what happened
to them. (Tr. 59) The summary does not show any payments after November 20, 2018.
(AE B)
the
From January 21, 2018, to November 20, 2019, Applicant paid $536 per month to
address  the  student  loans  held  by  DOE’s  Default  Resolution  Group;  however,  the
payments were not applied “to guaranty agencies or to the Department prior to when the
debt entered default.” (AE G; AE H; AE V at 1-2) From November 20, 2019, to March 11,
2020, he paid $592 per month to DOE. (AE G; AE I; AE V at 1-2) All of his payments were
applied to fees and interest, and none of his payments were applied to the principal owed.
(AE G) The student loan payments were temporarily stopped  in April 2020, due to the
Corona virus. (AE J; AE V at 1-2)
On March 9, 2020, and May 15, 2020, Applicant paid Navient $305. (AE C; AE M)
He said his first payment to Navient was on March 9, 2020. (Tr. 61) He said he believed
the $305 payment applied to the five  ECMC loans totaling $49,572. (Tr. 60; AE B) He
provided an April 2020 statement indicating the $305 payment applied to two consolidated
student  loans  totaling  $52,810.  (AE  M)  No  payment  was  due  in  April  2020  due  to  the
impact of the Corona virus. (AE M)
Applicant said he was making “two simultaneous payments with Navient and then
[to]  Immediate  Credit  Recovery”  (ICR).  (Tr.  41)  He  was  making  $592  payments  every
month through garnishment of his salary. (Tr. 41-42; AE A)  His pay statement for March
6, 2020, showed that his employer paid $1,479 out of his salary to address his student
loans in the year to date. (AE A) He was unsure about how long the garnishment was in
effect. (Tr. 57) He believed that after five more payments to ICR, he would complete the
ICR program and rehabilitate his loans. (Tr. 42) Applicant did not provide documentation
showing which student loans were included in the Navient or the ICR programs that were
being paid through a garnishment.
Applicant  said  he  always  wanted  to  pay  his  student  loans;  however,  he  lacked
sufficient income to do so. (Tr. 42) Applicant sets aside about $300 monthly for his parents
in case they have an emergency. (Tr. 45-46) He also has some medical bills totaling about
$1,500. (Tr. 46, 52-53) He has a savings account with more than $10,000 but less than
$100,000 on deposit. (Tr. 48-49) He clarified that he might have between $40,000 and
$50,000 in his savings account. (Tr. 48-49)
On March 13, 2020,  Applicant  signed  a Federal  Loan  Rehabilitation  form which
includes a budget to enable a student loan creditor to set a payment level that he could
afford. (AE E) The loan rehabilitation program involves making nine9 payments over 10
months, and the monthly payment amount is as low as $5. (AE E at 1; See Department
of  Education,  Federal  Student  Aid  Website  Links:  Home;  Manage  Loans;  Delinquency
and Default; Getting Out of Default, located at  https://studentaid.gov/manage-
loans/default/get-out  (HE  7)  Applicant’s  March  13,  2020  Loan  Rehabilitation  form
indicated his current monthly income is $5,221. (AE E at 1) His monthly expenses total
$4,013, and his four largest monthly expenses are food ($1,800), student loans ($896),
housing ($550), and utilities ($400). (AE E at 1) There is no item on the form for amounts
withheld for Social Security, Medicare, and federal and state taxes, which total $1,278, in
his pay statement. (AE A (pay statement))
After his hearing, Applicant submitted his March 30, 2020 Loan Rehabilitation form,
which  indicated  his  current  monthly  income  is  $3,085.  (AE  K)  He  said  his  monthly
expenses total $2,537, and his four largest monthly expenses are food ($500), private
student loans ($305), housing ($550), and utilities ($600). (AE K) According to Applicant’s
pay statement for March 15, 2020 to March 28, 2020, his gross pay for two weeks was
$2,611 or $5,222 per month. (AE J). He did not explain the income discrepancy between
the March 13 and March 30, 2020 Loan Rehabilitation forms; however, I conclude that
the March 30, 2020 the student loan form reflects correctly reflects net pay information
and not gross pay information.
Applicant’s Loan Rehabilitation form states, “If I rehabilitate a loan and default on
the same loan again in the future, I may not rehabilitate that loan a second time.” (AE K,
at 1 ¶ 12; AE K at 3 § 4 ¶ 6) Other than the five ECMC loans totaling $49,572 discussed
previously,  he  did  not  specify  any  particular  student  loans  that  were  previously
rehabilitated.
Applicant is in the process of applying for an income-driven student loan payment
program. A brief explanation of that program follows:
Under  a  loan  rehabilitation  agreement,  your  loan  holder  will  determine  a
reasonable  monthly  payment  amount  that  is  equal  to  15  percent  of  your
annual  discretionary  income,  divided  by  12.  Discretionary  income  is  the
amount  of  your  adjusted  gross  income  (from  your  most  recent  federal
income  tax  return)  that  exceeds  150  percent  of  the  poverty  guideline
amount for your state and family size. You must provide documentation of
your income to your loan holder. (HE 7)
It is possible to obtain a lower monthly payment than that described in the quoted formula,
which  is  known  as  an  alternative  monthly  payment.  (HE  7)  The  alternative  monthly
payment is based on submitting a budget and not on the information on a tax return. (AE
E; HE 7)
On  March  25,  2020,  Applicant  signed  a  loan  rehabilitation  agreement  which
specified  “I  understand  that  I  must  make  at  least  9  monthly  payments  of  $128.00
beginning March 25, 2020, with each payment due on the 25th of each month thereafter.”
(AE K) In March 2020, an Education Department representative informed Applicant “that
all collection activity has been suspended for at least 60 days and [he was] not required
to make payments due to the pandemic.” (AE V at 2) His first $128 payment was made
on  May  11,  2020.  (AE  L;  AE  V  at  2)  He  believed  that  after  he  completes  the  loan
rehabilitation  period,  he  will  be  able  to  consolidate  his  federal  student  loans  through
Navient and make the required monthly payments of about $337. (AE V at 2)
Applicant attended credit counseling in May 2020. (AE N; AE O; AE V at 2-3) He
completed a budget. (AE O) He also completed training courses in several areas including
information technology, cyber security, and protection of personal and medical privacy.
(AE S)
Applicant timely filed his federal income tax returns for the last four years. (AE P;
AE  V  at  2)  His  adjusted  gross  income  on  his  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  tax
transcripts  for  tax  years  2016,  2017,  and  2018  was  as  follows:  2016-$51,576;  2017-
$54,667;  and  2018-$56,428.  (AE  P)  For  each  of  those  three  years,  he  received  a
substantial tax refund when he filed his tax returns. (AE P)
Applicant promised to maintain his financial responsibility in the future. He said:
I will always pay my debts to maintain financial stability. I will never put myself
in a financial situation where my Security Clearance will be in question or be
placed at risk, and if I fail to adhere to this statement, I consent to automatic
revocation of my Security Clearance. (AE Q; AE V at 3)
