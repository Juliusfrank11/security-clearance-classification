Applicant,  44,  was  hired  by  a  federal  contracting  company  in  May  2018.  It  is
unclear  from  the  record  if  Applicant  started  the  assembler  positon  for  which  he  was
hired.  He  completed  the  security  clearance  application,  his  first,  in  May  2018.  In
response to questions about financial delinquencies, Applicant disclosed a student loan
account. This delinquent account for $21,708 is the only allegation in the SOR. (GE 1-3)
Applicant  attended  community  college  between  June  2004  and  July  2005,
earning  an  associateâ€™s  degree  in  an  unspecified  area  of  study.  He  financed  his  tuition
with at least two student loans. Applicant claims that one of the student loans became
delinquent  during  a  period  of  unemployment  from  September  2008  to  January  2009.
Applicant  blames  his  ongoing  inability  to  rehabilitate  or  repay  the  delinquent  loan  on
three  periods  of  unemployment  between  September  2008  and  May  2018,  totaling  22
months. He also cites chronic underemployment at a series of day labor and temporary
jobs. (GE 3-4)
Applicant  did  not  provide  any  updated  financial  information  in  response  to  the
FORM. The only available financial information in the record, a July 2018 credit report,
shows that Applicant has an overwhelmingly favorable credit history. Of the 12 accounts
reported, 11 (including the other student loan account) have a history of being paid as
agreed and are in good standing. The credit report also shows that the creditor holding
the  student  loan  account  at  issue  has  written  off  the  debt.  Applicant  has  not  provided
any  updated  information  about  the  status  of  the  account  or  his  attempts,  if  any,  to
rehabilitate it. (GE 5)
