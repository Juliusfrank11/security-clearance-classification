Applicant  is  57  years  old.  He  has  two  adult  children  from  his  first  marriage.  He
and his second wife have been married since 2003. He earned a bachelor’s degree in
1984. He served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1984 through 1986 and from
1990  through  2004.  Since  2004,  he  has  worked  intermittently  for  a  government
contracting company owned by his wife (Company A). He was granted a DOD security
clearance  in  2008.  He  has  worked  full  time  for  Company  A  since  2018.  Another
company,  for  whom  he  has  not  begun  working,  sponsored  this  pending  security
clearance application. (FORM response; Items 4, 5)
The SOR alleged Applicant’s eight delinquent debts totaling $67,772, which were
confirmed  by  the  credit  reports.  In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  each  of  the
alleged debts, but disputed that any of them remained unresolved. However, the record
evidence established that only three SOR debts had been resolved. (Items 3, 6-8)
Applicant  initiated  contact  with  the  creditor  of  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a
($33,297 unsecured-loan account) in November and December 2019. He proffered that,
because the account was “closed,” the creditor did not require an official payment plan
and would accept a monthly payment of “any amount,” which could only be scheduled
three months at a time. In December 2019, he scheduled a $25 monthly payment to be
debited  in  January,  February,  and  March  2020.  His  February  2020  credit  report
reflected that he made one $26 payment. This debt remains unresolved. (AE A;  AE J;
AE M at 3)
Applicant negotiated a settlement with the creditor of the debt alleged in SOR ¶
1.b ($9,969 secured-loan account) in February 2020. He agreed to pay a total of $6,604
via  monthly  payments  of  $660  for  10  months  beginning  in  March  2020.  He  provided
proof  of  the  settlement  agreement,  but  not  of  any  payments.  This  debt  remains
unresolved. (AE F)
Applicant  initiated  contact  with  the  creditor  of  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c
($8,664  unsecured-loan  account)  in  December  2019  and  February  2020.  He  proffered
that  the  creditor  would  not  accept  any  payments  pursuant  to  a  statute  of  limitations
under state law. This debt remains unresolved. (AE A, L)
Applicant negotiated a settlement with the creditor of the debt alleged in SOR ¶
1.d  ($5,871  credit-card  account)  in  November  2019  and  February  2020.  He  agreed  to
pay  $143  per  month  from  November  2019  through  February  2020.  He  increased  the
payment to $172 per month beginning March 2020 in order to have the account paid off
by December 2020. Applicant provided proof of a $143 payment made in January 2020.
His  January  2020  statement  and  February  2020  credit  report  reflected  balances  of
$4,290 and $4,146, respectively. This debt remains unresolved. (Item 8 at 1; AE C; AE
M at 5)
Applicant  resolved  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  ($3,369  unsecured-loan
account),  SOR  ¶  1.f  ($2,540  credit-card  account),  and  SOR  ¶  1.g  ($935  credit-card
account)  in  January  2020,  March  2019,  and  September  2019,  respectively.  (AE  G,  K;
AE M at 3, 8; Item 8 at 3)
Applicant  paid  $100  per  month  to  the  creditor  of  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.h
($3,127 credit-card account) between June 2019 and September 2019. As of February
2020, Applicant asserted that the creditor stopped accepting payments due to a statute
of limitations under state law. This debt remains unresolved. (AE H)
In  November  2019  and  February  2020,  Applicant  initiated  contact  with  the
creditor of a $1,230 credit-card debt not alleged in the SOR. He negotiated a settlement
to pay $52 in February 2020, $77 per month between March and November 2020, and
one  payment  of  $69  in  December  2020.  He  provided  proof  of  the  $52  payment.  This
debt remains unresolved. (AE A, B)
In  November  2019,  he  initiated  contact  with  the  creditor  of  a  $15,082  loan
account not alleged in the SOR. He negotiated a settlement to pay $8,353 via monthly
payments  of  $232  beginning  in  October  2019.  He  provided  proof  of  a  $232  payment
made  in  February  2020.  This  debt  remains  unresolved.  I  will  consider  any  unalleged
debts only for the purposes of evaluating mitigation and the whole person concept. (AE
A, I; Item 5 at 4)
The  SOR  debts  became  delinquent  between  2016  and  2017.  Without  providing
specific details or corroborating documents, Applicant attributed those debts to income
losses  that  he  and  his  wife  suffered  between  2014  and  2017.  Following  a  2014  work
injury, his wife has struggled with chronic health issues that have affected her ability to
work. She was initially rendered unable to work for approximately eight months. Since
then,  she  has  only  been  able  to  resume  part-time  work,  which  does  not  provide  “any
significant  income  to  the  household.”  Additionally,  Applicant  spent  several  months  in
2016  working  remotely  to  help  his  mother  care  for  his  ill  father  and,  once  he  passed
away, settle the estate. During that time, he provided unspecified financial assistance to
his  mother.  Finally,  Applicant  was  laid  off  by  his  employer  of  five  years  in  July  2017.
While he regained employment in October 2017, he did so at a lesser salary. (Items 3,
4; FORM response)
Applicant  previously  experienced  financial  problems  due  to  Company  A’s
financial  instability  following  the  2008  global  recession  and  2013  federal  government
sequestration. A steady decline in contract awards beginning in 2009 eventually led to a
complete loss in 2013. In order to try to keep Company A afloat in the interim, he and
his  wife  incurred  significant  debts.  Without  providing  specific  details  or  corroborating
documents, he averred that he was able to manage and eventually resolve those debts
with the assistance of a debt consolidation company. Applicant has chosen to manage
the  SOR  debts  on  his  own  with  his  family’s  increased  income.  (Item  5  at  6;  FORM
response at 3)
Applicant’s  wife  received  a  worker’s  compensation  settlement  of  an  unspecified
amount, which “helped bridge [them] in 2016.” Without providing a specific breakdown
or  corroborating  documents,  he  asserted  that  he  and  his  wife  settled  or  paid  off
approximately  $870,000  of  debt  between  2009  and  2019  (prioritizing  his  wife’s  debts
first and then their joint debts), including short-selling their home, paying non-delinquent
federal income taxes to the IRS pursuant to an installment agreement, and “many other”
unspecified secured and unsecured debts. He declared that, as of at least January 2020
(and for a prior period not specified in the record), his wife has been receiving monthly
disability compensation “in excess of $3,000” after qualifying for a 100% disability rating
from the U.S. Department of Veteran’s Affairs for an injury sustained while she served in
the Army. In February 2020, Applicant described his income from Company A as “more
income”  than  he  had  been  receiving  from  previous  employers  for  whom  he  worked
between 2012 and 2018. He provided no more specific details about his and his wife’s
relevant income history. The record evidence also contained scant corroborating details
and  documents  concerning  his  family’s  relevant  expense  history.  (Item  3;  FORM
Response)
Applicant’s  current  repayment  strategy  has  been  influenced  by  a  nationally
recognized  financial  counseling  program.  He  explained  that  the  goal  of  the  program’s
snowball  plan  is  to  establish  a  small  savings  first,  and  then  tackle  each  debt  from
smallest to largest. He attributed his delay in resolving the SOR debts primarily to a lack
of  sufficient  income  and  his  creditors’  unwillingness  to  accept  partial  payments.  He
declared that he had enough income to begin addressing his SOR debts as of October
2019 and that, as of February 2020, he had budgeted $1,142 per month to pay off his
SOR debts. (FORM Response; Item 3)
In his FORM response, Applicant maintained that he had “not felt this confident in
[his]  career  or  financial  future  in  ten  years.”  He  anticipated  that  Company  A’s  income
opportunities will continue growing. He wished to remain eligible for a security clearance
so that he can “contribute at an even greater level to our nation’s success and security.”
He volunteers in a leadership position with an organization involved with national policy
and infrastructure resilience readiness.
