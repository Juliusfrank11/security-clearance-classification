The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to timely file Federal (SOR
¶ 1.a) and state (SOR ¶ 1.b) income tax returns for tax years 2013, 2016, and 2017, and
that, as of January 3, 2020, he owed $67,869 in Federal student-loan debts in collection
(SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.o).
When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he answered “I admit” to having
failed to timely file Federal and state income tax returns for the years alleged. He asserted
that his W-2 form arrived too late to timely file his income tax returns for 2013; that when he
received the form, he informed a “tax agent,” who told him to file the next tax year. He cited
financial hardships that apparently led to his failure to timely file tax returns for 2016 and
2017. Applicant provided documentation of Federal and state income tax payments to show
that he had resolved his tax liabilities. Applicant also admitted that he had defaulted on the
Federal student loans. He explained that he could not keep up with the payments, which
resulted in penalties and then a delinquency status where he was no longer allowed to
make payments. He provided documentation of a loan-rehabilitation program, and indicated
that, because he is in graduate school, he is not currently required to make payments. After
considering the FORM, which includes Applicant’s Answer to the SOR (GE 1), and AE A, I
make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is a 53-year-old dual citizen of his native Mexico and the United States
since his U.S. naturalization in March 2009. He began working as an engineer in the U.S.
defense industry in December 2016, and in December 2018, he submitted a Questionnaire
for National Security Positions (SF 86) seeking his first DOD clearance. (GE 2.)
Applicant immigrated to the United States at age 23 after a difficult childhood and
years of personal hardship in Mexico. Applicant was mistreated by his mother, who blamed
him for her divorce from his father. After he ran away from her home at age 13 or 14, he
lived with his father and then an uncle for a few months until he was taken in by a family
that  owned  a factory  that  manufactured handbags.  He  stayed with  the  family  for three
years, and worked in their family business for over two years. In his late teens, he moved to
Mexico City where he resumed his schooling at the junior high level, but he struggled to
support  himself  and  stayed  only  a  year  before  returning  to  his  previous  locale.  In
September 1989, he married his first wife, a native of Mexico. After several years, his visa
was approved to immigrate to the United States, and he lawfully emigrated in December
1989. He became a U.S. permanent resident in December 2000. (GE 1; AE A.)
Applicant’s knowledge of English was limited when he came to the United States. He
supported himself over the years through various employments, including as a baker, car
washer, salesman, janitor, waiter, taco maker, and gardener (AE A), although the dates for
each job were not provided. In June 2001, Applicant and his first wife separated, and they
were divorced in May 2005. (GE 2.)
In approximately 2000, Applicant began studies at a community college toward an
associate’s degree in liberal arts. Applicant lacked any formal education and had to take
remedial classes. He demonstrated an interest in and facility with mathematics. (GE 1.) He
volunteered at the college’s tutorial center where he became friendly with another student.
In May 2003, Applicant began living with this student and his family, and their home served
as Applicant’s primary residence while in college. (GEs 1-2; AE A.) Applicant supported
himself  as  a  math  tutor.  In  the  spring  of  2004,  with  the  support  and  assistance  of  two
professors,  he  started  a  Math  Club  on  campus.  In  the  summer  of  2004,  Applicant
participated in a program at a nearby public university (university X), which introduced him
to hands-on research in science and engineering. In November 2004, Applicant began a
teaching internship in mathematics at a local high school under a program sponsored by
university X. At age 38, in May 2005, he earned an associate’s degree. At graduation, he
was given an award for excellence in performance by a student. (AE A.)
In August 2005, Applicant began studies at university X toward his bachelor’s degree
in electrical engineering. (GE 1.) Between August 2005 and September 2008, Applicant
obtained 13 Federal student loans totaling $54,870 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.o). (GEs 3-5.) He also
took on three private student loans, of $3,000 in March 2007, $4,000 in July 2007, and
$2,444 in May 2008. (GE 3.) From February 2006 to June 2009, Applicant worked as a
research intern. In approximately July 2009, Applicant earned his bachelor’s degree. (GE
2.)
In December 2008, Applicant married his current wife in Mexico. He adopted her
son, who was born in June 2003. (GE 2.) His spouse and son remained in Mexico while
Applicant lived on campus during first three years in college and then with a friend in an
apartment during the school weeks of his final year. (GEs 1-2.)
After he graduated from college, Applicant was unemployed until September 2009,
when he began working under a staffing contract as a sustaining engineer for a commercial
electronics company. In November 2011, he converted to a full-time employee. (GE 2.)
In June 2011, Applicant’s spouse and son joined him in the United States. He rented
an apartment for his family, and over the next few years, he furnished their home on credit.
He bought a leather sofa, flat televisions, and other items, including musical instruments.
(GE 2.) Applicant paid his consumer credit-card and car-loan obligations according to their
account  terms.  His  Federal  student  loans  were  current  through  April  2012.  (GE  4.)
Applicant obtained car loans for $21,505 in July 2012 and for $32,269 in August 2012. (GE
1.)
Around 2013, Applicant began to struggle financially. He made minimum payments
on  some  accounts  and  skipped  payments  on  some  accounts,  which  led  to  increased
balances due to penalties. (GE 1.) Applicant was 120 days past due on his Federal student
loans as of June 2013. (GE 4.)
After his Federal student loans (then totaling approximately $75,361 due to interest
and  collection  fees)  were  placed  for  collection,  Applicant  entered  into  a  student-loan
rehabilitation program in February 2015. His $170 monthly payments were automatically
deducted  from  his  pay  for  eight  months.  He  successfully  completed  the  rehabilitation
program, but then could not keep up with the payments and again defaulted. (GE 1.)
In approximately May 2016, Applicant was laid off when his division was closed
down. (GE 1.) He found a job as a product development engineer for another commercial
company but left that employment under mutual agreement in July 2016 over an issue
involving certification of a unit’s performance. (GE 2.)
Applicant  was  unemployed  for  the  next  four  to  five  months  except  for  part-time
janitorial work. He primarily supported the family by running up debt on his credit cards.
(GEs 2-3.) His and his spouse’s rent at that time was $1,365 per month. In December
2016, Applicant moved to a Midwestern state without his spouse and son for a job as an
application engineer with a defense contractor. He continued to pay his spouse’s rent while
incurring his own expenses in his new locale. Applicant indicates that he paid rent and
utilities for two apartments for about seven or eight months until the lease for his spouse’s
apartment  ended  and  she  and  their  son  joined  him  in  his  new  locale.  Available  lease
documentation shows that their lease ran from November 1, 2015, through October 31,
2016, when it became a month-to-month tenancy. (GE 1.)  Applicant has been living at his
current address since February 2017. (GE 2.)
Applicant demonstrated an “extraordinary ability” to learn about new concepts and
immediately apply it to his work. Before long, he outgrew his position for which he was hired
and became a design engineer in an engineering services group. (GE 1.) In November
2017, Applicant began working for his current employer. The job promised more complexity
and paid him 30% more than his salary with his previous employer. (GE 2.)
In June 2018, a collection entity billed him $83,315 for his defaulted Federal student
loans.  Some  $16,309  of  the  debt  was  for  collection  fees.  Applicant  requested  the
opportunity to rehabilitate his student loans, but he objected to the repayment amount. He
requested an alternative repayment based on reported joint income with his spouse of
$3,300 per month but $3,305 in monthly expenses, which included $900 in housing costs.
(GE 2.)
In December 2018, Applicant was offered a position with a defense contractor that
required him to obtain a security clearance. On December 17, 2018, Applicant completed
and certified to the accuracy of an SF 86. Although a report of his February 2019 subject
interview indicates that he was employed by the defense contractor sponsoring him for a
security clearance, his W-2 form for 2019 and other evidence indicate that he still works for
the company that hired him in November 2017. (GE 2; AE A.) On his SF 86, Applicant
responded affirmatively to an inquiry into whether, in the last seven years, he had failed to
file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance. He indicated
that he filed his returns, but with respect to tax year 2013, he filed his returns “very close” to
the due date for that tax year, but that he received his W-2 form late from a part-time job.
He  indicated that he filed an update the following year. He reported that he had owed
$1,476 in Federal income taxes for 2013; $4,012 in Federal and $324 in state income taxes
for 2016; and $4,464 in Federal and $594 state income taxes for 2017. He explained that
his Federal and state tax delinquencies for 2016 resulted from his failure to timely pay
income taxes on his part-time income from his janitorial business, and that he had failed to
make timely payments on an installment agreement with the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS). He cited the cost of maintaining separate residences for himself and his spouse
while he was working in the Midwest as the reason for his tax delinquencies for tax year
2017. However, he explained that all of his delinquent income taxes had been paid by
October 2018. (GE 1.)
Tax  documents  in  the  record  show  that  Applicant  entered  into  an  installment
agreement with the IRS in early 2016 to repay his tax liability for 2013. He made a $180
payment on March 20, 2016, and a $300 payment on June 6, 2016. On June 8, 2016, the
IRS  billed  his  installment  of  $300  on  a  balance  of  $1,562  for  tax  year  2013.  Applicant
defaulted on that agreement. In 2018, he entered into an installment agreement with the
IRS to address his tax debt for tax year 2017 at $150 a month. He provided evidence of
Federal tax payments of $150 on June 6, 2018, $150 on September 15, 2018, and $735 on
September 25, 2018, under his installment agreement. On September 25, 2018, Applicant
made separate lump-sum credit-card payments, inclusive of service fees, of $1,505 for tax
year 2013, $4,091 for tax year 2016, and $4,552 for tax year 2017, which resolved his
Federal tax debts. (GE 1.)
Sometime before February 27, 2018, Applicant requested an installment agreement
to  repay  his  state  income  tax  liabilities  (tax  year  not  specified)  at  $100  a  month.  He
submitted the paperwork on March 14, 2018, and he made a $100 payment on June 20,
2018, although it is unclear whether he was under an established installment agreement.
On September 25, 2018, he made lump-sum credit-card payments of $330 for tax year
2016 and $607 for 2017, which resolved his state tax debts. (GE 1.)
Applicant also responded affirmatively on his SF 86 to an inquiry concerning any
current delinquency on a Federal debt, and he listed $83,463 in student-loan debts that
were in a loan-rehabilitation program that was close to being completed. He explained that
he was responsible for the “bad organization” of his income between 2013 and 2017, but
that after rehabilitating his student loans, he planned to pay off his accounts, reduce his
family’s living expenses, and diligently manage his family’s budget. He added that he was
working hard toward possibly being promoted for the income that would bring to enable him
to repay his student loans faster. He expressed his understanding that that his student-loan
delinquencies could be seen as carelessness or a failure to commit to resolving them on his
part.  He  requested  the  opportunity  to  solve  the  matter,  and  mentioned  some  of  the
hardships over the years that he endured to obtain his education. (GE 2.)
A  check  of  Applicant’s  credit  on  January  17,  2019,  revealed  that  Applicant  was
making timely payments on his three private student loans with balances totaling $4,528,
although the loans had been 90 days past due in April 2017. He was also making timely
monthly payments of $380 and $591 respectively on two joint car loans obtained in May
2016 for $21,738 (balance $10,645) and $33,850 (balance $17,964). His had three active
credit-card accounts with outstanding balances totaling $2,442 that he was repaying on
time. His Federal student loans were in collection status. (GE 3.)
On  February  20,  2019,  Applicant  had  a  telephone  interview  with  an  authorized
investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The investigator’s report of
that interview indicates that Applicant responded affirmatively when asked whether, in the
last seven years, he had failed to file Federal and state income tax returns, and that he
stated he did not file his taxes in 2013, 2016, and 2017 because he was worried he was
going to owe a big tax bill and would not have enough money to survive. However, he had
paid all his tax bills in full as of October 25, 2018. He admitted owing student-loan debts,
but indicated that he had started repaying them at $500 [sic] per month in December 2018.
He characterized his financial situation as “getting better.” (GE 3.)
Applicant rehabilitated his student loans, and they were transferred to a Federal
student-loan servicer in late January 2019. At that time, he owed principal balances totaling
$54,870 and $13,068 in interest. In February 2019, he paid $60 toward his Federal student
loans. He made $350 payments in March 2019, April 2019,  May 2019, and July 2019.
There is no evidence that he made a payment in June 2019. In August 2019, Applicant paid
$175, and in September 2019, he paid $100 to bring his balance to $67,954. Some $1,735
of his payments went to interest in 2019. His student loans are currently deferred with a
total balance of approximately $69,402. (GE 1.)
In the summer of 2018, Applicant began graduate studies in electrical engineering to
improve  his  earnings  potential  and  to  better  contribute  to  the  nation’s  technical
advancement in communications. He was admitted to the program conditioned on him
completing nine or more hours of graduate work with a cumulative grade point average of
at least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale. He completed an independent study for two credit hours that
summer. During the fall term 2018, he earned six hours credit. He took and passed four
hours in the summer of 2019, so by the fall of 2019, he was considered to be in good
standing. That fall, he enrolled in two graduate-level courses with two labs but withdrew
from one of the courses and its associated lab because of his commitments at his full-time
job. (GE 1; AE A.) For the spring semester 2020, he is presently taking one graduate level
course, a related lab, and thesis work. He plans to resume his student-loan payments in
September 2020 when he finishes graduate school, which is being paid for by his current
employer. (GE 1.)
Applicant’s April 2019 credit report shows that his Federal student loans are deferred
until May 2022. He continued to make timely payments on his three open revolving charge
accounts  with  balances  totaling  $4,981;  his  three  private  student  loans  with  balances
totaling $3,891; and his joint car loans with balances of $5,902 and $10,004. He had no
new credit accounts. (GE 5.)
Applicant and his spouse filed their joint Federal income tax return on time for tax
year 2019. Applicant’s W-2 shows earned wages of $83,451, but social security wages of
$86,600. He and his spouse’s earned wages totaled $105,749. They overpaid their Federal
income taxes by approximately $6,750. (GE 1.) There is no evidence of what they did with
their refund. In April 2020, Applicant indicated that he and his spouse are taking steps to
save money by cooking at home and purchasing only items they need. (AE A.)
A co-worker who has worked alongside Applicant on multiple projects over the last
two years attests that Applicant has always been willing to go the extra mile to ensure
successful  outcomes  at  work.  Applicant  provides  support  to  advance  the  technical
understanding  for  manufacturing  technicians  as  designs  move  into  the  manufacturing
phase.  This  co-worker  considers Applicant to be a crucial team member.  As Applicant
continues his engineering studies, he has shared his knowledge across their division. (GE
1.)
