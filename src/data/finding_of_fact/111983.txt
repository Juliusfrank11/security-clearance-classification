Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges ten delinquent debts totaling $32,717 as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a is a judgment entered against Applicant in August 2018 for $13,849. In
his  SOR  response,  he  said  he  is  paying  $150  monthly  to  address  this  debt.  In  the
summary of Applicant’s June 20, 2019 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal
subject interview (PSI), he said the vehicle was repossessed, and he will be making $150
monthly payments until August 2024. (Item 5 at 2) Applicant’s April 2, 2020 credit report,
the most recent credit report of record, indicates the current balance is $11,128. (Item 7
at 2) He is credited with mitigating this debt because he has an established payment plan
addressing this debt.
SOR  ¶  1.b  is  a  judgment  entered  against  Applicant  in  June  2019  for  $7,161.
Applicant and his spouse co-signed for this debt, which relates to purchase of a vehicle.
(Item 3) In Applicant’s June 20, 2019 OPM PSI, Applicant said the debt resulted from a
repossessed  vehicle  in  2017.  (Item  5  at  3)  Applicant  and  his  spouse  were  divorced  in
2017,  and  she  did  not  make  payments.  (Item  3)  Applicant  discussed  payment
arrangements  with  the  creditor;  however,  no  payment  arrangements  have  been
established. (Id.)
SOR ¶ 1.c is a child support debt for $5,266, and SOR ¶ 1.e is a child support debt
for $864. As for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c, Applicant “waited a year for DNA testing.” (Item 3)
Child support accrued beginning the date his third child was born. (Id.) After parentage
was established, an arrearage payment was added to his monthly child support payment,
and the payment is made directly from his monthly income. (Id.) In Applicant’s June 20,
2019 OPM PSI, he said that he was paying child support for three children. (Item 5 at 2)
Around September 2017, he fell behind on payments for two of his children while he was
changing jobs. (Id.) Applicant was unsure about the amount of his child support arrearage.
(Id.)  Applicant’s  April  2,  2020  credit  report,  the  most  recent  credit  report  of  record,
indicates three child support accounts, and only one of them was delinquent for $4,758.
(Item 7 at 4-5) Applicant is credited with mitigating the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($864) because
his credit report indicates it is not delinquent.
SOR ¶ 1.d is a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $3,109, and SOR
¶  1.g  is  a  debt  placed  for  collection  for  $679.  Applicant  said  he  had  not  made  any
arrangements  for  these  debts  because  of  paying  off  other  debts.  He  promised  to  take
care of these debts. (Item 3)
SOR ¶ 1.f is a debt placed for collection for $435. In Applicant’s June 20, 2019
OPM PSI, Applicant said this credit card debt went to collections in 2014. (Item 5 at 3)
Applicant  discussed  payment  arrangements  with  the  creditor;  however,  no  payment
arrangements have been established. (Item 3)
SOR ¶ 1.h is a debt placed for collection for $632. Applicant discussed payment
arrangements  with  the  creditor,  and  the  creditor  said  he  could  establish  payment
arrangements when he could afford to do so. (Item 3)
SOR ¶ 1.i is a debt placed for collection for $425. This debt resulted from a broken
lease  when  Applicant  was  traveling  for  work.  (Item  3)  Applicant  discussed  payment
arrangements with the creditor, and he said he would make payment arrangements when
he could afford to do so. (Id.)
SOR ¶ 1.j is a debt placed for collection for $297. In Applicant’s June 20, 2019
OPM  PSI,  Applicant  said  the  debt  resulted  when  his  vehicle  was  towed  during
repossession. (Item 5 at 5) Applicant said he would make payment arrangements to pay
this debt when he can afford to do so. (Item 3)
In his SOR response, Applicant concluded, “I believe I am trying my best, to [the
extent] which my funds will allow [and] to take care of all [of] my debt. All the debt will be
taken care of, it just takes time.” (Item 3)
In  the  FORM,  Department  Counsel  noted  the  absence  of  corroborating  or
supporting  documentation  of  resolution  of  the  SOR  debts.  Aside  from  Applicant’s
uncorroborated statements and the most recent credit report, there is no documentary
evidence  that  Applicant  paid,  arranged  to  pay,  settled,  compromised,  or  otherwise
resolved  any  of  the  SOR  debts.  The  record  lacks  corroborating  or  substantiating
documentation  and  detailed  explanations  of  the  causes  for  his  financial  problems  and
other mitigating information. The FORM informed Applicant that he had 30 days from the
receipt  of  the  FORM  “in  which  to  submit  a  documentary  response  setting  forth
objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as appropriate. If you
do  not  file  any  objections  or  submit  any  additional  information  .  .  .  your  case  will  be
assigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination based solely” on the evidence
set forth in this FORM. (FORM at 6 (emphasis added)) He did not respond to the FORM.
