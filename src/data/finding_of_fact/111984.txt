In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, two of the three
SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.c.). Applicant’s
admissions and his comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the
following findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  an  acquisition  management  analyst  with  his  current  employer  since  May  2020.  He
previously worked as a business analyst for another contractor from September 2018 until
May  2020.  He  was  unemployed  from  September  2017,  when  another  employer  lost  a
contract  and  laid  off  its  employees,  including  Applicant,  and  he  remained  unemployed
until September 2018. A 2009 high school graduate, he received a bachelor’s degree in
2014. He has never served with the U.S. military. He was granted a secret clearance in
2014. He has never been married, and he has no children.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can be found in the following exhibits: GE 1 (SF 86, dated June 19, 2019); GE 2 (Equifax
Credit Report, dated July 9, 2020); GE 3 (Equifax Credit Report, dated July 25, 2019);
and Applicant’s Answer to SOR, dated November 11, 2019).
In  his  SF  86,  Applicant  acknowledged  having  two  delinquent  accounts  that  he
attributed to his unemployment. He contended that he was making monthly payments to
one  creditor,  and  that  he  would  reach  out  to  the  other  creditor  to  seek  an  “amicable
solution to catch up on payments.” (GE 1, at 33-35)
The SOR alleged three delinquent accounts totaling approximately $29,454, set
forth as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a. refers to an automobile loan opened in December 2015 that became
delinquent in June 2018, and $21,944 was charged off. The account was closed by the
creditor. (GE 3, at 1; Tr. at 35-36) In October 2018, with funds derived from an inheritance,
Applicant made a $3,240 payment to the creditor. (AE E; Tr. at 36-37) That was the most
recent payment made by him, and the current unpaid balance is approximately $19,053.
(GE 2, at 2; Tr. at 40) In June 2019, he declared that he would reach out to the creditor
to reach the “amicable solution.” (GE 1, at 35) In March 2020, he indicated that he hoped
to be able to resolve the account within the next three years. (Answer to the SOR, at 4)
However, he was contacted by a collection agent in April 2020, and he agreed to make a
$500 payment in May 2020. (AE B) That payment was never made. (Tr. at 41) Despite
the fact that the account was closed, Applicant has retained the vehicle, and currently
uses it. (Tr. at 35, 38) The account has not been resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.b.  refers  to  a  credit-card  account  opened  in  April  2015  that  became
delinquent in September 2017, and approximately $10,393 was charged off. (GE 1, at 34;
GE 2, at 2) In May 2019, a Garnishment Summons was issued in the amount of $10,524,
and another such summons was issued in January 2020 in the amount of $5,567. (AE A)
In June 2019, Applicant claimed to be making $500 per paycheck. (GE 1, at 34) In March
2020, he stated that the account would be paid in full by the end of July 2020. (Answer to
the  SOR, at  5) He submitted  some  documentation  supporting eight  payments,  totaling
approximately $3,637 made on July 15, 2020, but he denied that he had made payments
in the amounts reported. (AE C; GE 5; Tr. at 45) As of a week before the August hearing,
the remaining unpaid balance was $1,718. (AE G) He claimed that he attempted to call
the collection agent, but has been unsuccessful. He has not written the  creditor or the
collection agent. (Tr. at 48) The account was seemingly in the process of being resolved,
but  Applicant  has  failed  to  furnish  documentation  reflecting  his  actual  undisputed
payments.
SOR ¶ 1.c. refers to a jewelry store charge account opened in August 2016 with a
$7,000 credit limit that became delinquent with a past due balance of $358 in September
2018, and was eventually sold to a credit purchaser of delinquent debt. (GE 2, at 2; GE
3, at 2) In March 2020, Applicant stated he would pay one-half of the account by March
13, 2020, with the remainder to be paid by March 27, 2020. (Answer to the SOR, at 6) He
actually made his first payment, for $180 in September 3, 2020, and a second payment,
for $178, on September 8, 2020, both of which took place after the Notice of Hearing was
already issued. (AE F) The account has been resolved.
After   his  period   of  unemployment  ended  in   September  2018,  Applicant’s  new
employer started him  out at  $63,000 per year, and  by  the time  he left that employer in
May 2020, he was making $70,000 per year. He reported his current annual salary to be
$92,000.  (Tr.  at  35)   Although  Applicant  was  furnished  a  blank  Personal   Financial
Statement to be completed and  submitted by September 2020, he failed  to do so. (Tr. at
67) Therefore, it is not  known what  his  current financial  resources may be because he did
not report  his  current net monthly income  or  monthly expenses. He reported  a  monthly
remainder  of  $1,800  that  might  be  available  for  discretionary  spending  or  savings.  He
estimated that he currently has $3,000 in savings. (Tr. at 51-53) There is no evidence of
a  budget.  There  is  no  evidence  of  financial  counseling.  In  the  absence  of  additional
financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better
position financially than he had been.
