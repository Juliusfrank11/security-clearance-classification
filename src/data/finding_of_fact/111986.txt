In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted his 2013 Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing and
resulting discharge, but denied the three  charged-off debts and one collection account
alleged  in  the  SOR.  The  four  delinquent  debts  totaled  approximately  $31,000.  His
admission  is  adopted  here  as  a  finding  of  fact.  After  a  careful  review  of  the  pleadings
and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 61 years old. He has worked for federal contractors since September
2014.  He  had  periods  of  unemployment  from  August  to  November  2013  and  from
January to July 2012. He served in both the Navy and Army for approximately 10 years
and  received  honorable  discharges.  He  completed  his  bachelor’s  degree  in  1985.  He
was married for the fifth time in February 2018. The dates of his earlier marriages are:
1979-1981; 1982-1987; 1989-1992; and 1992-2018. He has five adult children. (Item 4)
Applicant’s  financial  difficulties  began  when  he  was  laid  off  from  a  senior
executive position, which led to his filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2013. The largest debt
included in the bankruptcy was his mortgage. He was unable to pay his mortgage as a
result of his job loss. Applicant claims that the remaining  SOR debts were incurred by
his fourth ex-wife. She revealed a drug addiction to opiates and several of the accounts
were  opened  to  fund  her drug  usage.  Applicant  was  unaware  of  the  accounts  until  he
was made aware of these debts during his background investigation. This ex-wife faced
several  felony  charges  for  criminal  behavior.  Applicant  sought  a  divorce,  which  was
finalized  in  2018.  All  the  debts  appear  on  Applicant’s  credit  reports.  (Items  3,  6,  8-10;
AE A)
Applicant  documented  that  he  enrolled  into  a  debt  resolution  program  (DRP)  in
December  2017  to  address  his  delinquent  debts.  Under  the  DRP,  Applicant  began
paying  $542  monthly  into  a  fund  held  by  the  DRP,  which  then  would  negotiate
settlements  with  Applicant’s  creditors.  Applicant  has  paid  into  this  account  monthly
since  February  2018.  An  account  activity  statement  shows  that  the  DRP  has  made
regular  payments  on  three  of  the  SOR  debts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b-1.d).  All  these  payments
predated  the  SOR.  Additionally,  payments  were  made  on  an  account  not  listed  in  the
SOR. Applicant’s credit report documents that he disputed the debt listed in SOR ¶ 1.e.
His credit report also shows that he is current on his student loan payments. (Item 3; AE
A-D)
