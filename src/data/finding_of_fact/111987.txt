Applicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since August 2018. He is applying for a security clearance for the
first  time. He  has  a  General  Educational  Development  (GED)  high  school  equivalency
diploma. The most recent information available indicates that he has never married and
he has no children. (Items 2, 3)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  problems.  The  SOR  alleges  four  delinquent
debts totaling about $40,000. The debts include two charged-off vehicle loans ($28,464
and  $6,464),  a  medical  debt  ($2,355),  and  unpaid  rent  ($3,354).  Applicant  admitted
owing all the debts.
Applicant  stated  that  he  cosigned  with  his  mother  for  the  $28,464  vehicle  loan
and  for  her  rent,  and  she  did  not  pay  the  accounts.  He  asserted  that  his  mother’s  car
was stolen and “insurance didn’t want to pay out.” None of the credit reports in evidence
list  the  debts  as  joint  accounts.  The  $6,464  vehicle  loan  resulted  from  a  motorcycle
accident. Insurance did not pay the full amount of the loan, and Applicant chose not to
pay  the  deficiency  balance  because  he  felt  that  his  credit  was  already  ruined  by  his
mother’s  failure  to  pay  the  auto  loan.  The  medical  debt  was  incurred  when  he  did  not
have health insurance. (Items 2-6)
Applicant indicated during his background interview in March 2019 that he did not
have the means to pay the debts at that time, but he planned to consolidate the debts in
the  following  year  to  pay  the  debts.  He  also  stated  that  he  will  not  cosign  any  more
loans.  He  asserted  that  he  was  living  within  his  means,  that  he  planned  to  rebuild  his
credit,  and  that he will pay all his  future  debts.  There is no evidence of  any payments
toward the debts alleged in the SOR. (Items 2-6)
