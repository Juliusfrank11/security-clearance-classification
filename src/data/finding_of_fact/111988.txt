Applicant  is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He  has worked for
his   current   employer  since  2009.  He  has   a  bachelor’s  degree   and   additional  post-
graduate  and  technical   courses.  He  is   married   for   the  second   time.   He   has  three
children  and five  stepchildren.  (Transcript (Tr.) at  32-34, 63; GE 1, 6; AE D-H)
Applicant’s  criminal  history  includes  arrests  for  driving  under  the  influence  and
domestic violence in 2001. He filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in 2009, and his debts
were discharged the same year. He was denied a security clearance in 2015 for failing
to  report  his  domestic  violence  charges  on  a  January  2012  security  clearance
application. He reported his criminal history, the denial of his security clearance, and his
financial  problems  on  a  January  2019  security  clearance  application.  He  submitted
documents and letters attesting to his excellent work performance and moral character.

The  SOR  as  amended  alleges  four  delinquent  debts.  The  debts  include  a
charged-off vehicle loan ($28,572), a charged-off credit card from a home improvement
store  ($5,623),  a  collection  account  to  a  telecommunications  company  ($945),  and  a
collection account for a warehouse store credit card ($6,286).
Applicant worked in the auto industry for a number of years. From about 2014 to
2018,  he  was  the  owner  of  a  part-time  business  in  which  he  bought  and  sold
aftermarket parts for cars. In about July 2015, he bought a performance truck for about
$75,000.  He  paid  about  $20,000  as  a  down  payment,  and  financed  the  remainder.  A
credit report shows the high balance on the loan as $50,054. (Tr. at 23, 34-35; GE 1-3,
6, 7)
About two weeks after he bought it, the truck was in an accident. The frame was
damaged,  and  the  car  dealer  told  Applicant  that  the  truck  should  be  totaled.  The
insurance company wanted to repair the truck. Applicant is not a mechanic, but he has
extensive  mechanical  experience,  and  he did  not  feel the truck would  be safe  to  drive
his family with a repaired frame. Applicant never reclaimed possession of the truck and
stopped  making  payments.  It  is  not  completely  clear,  but  the  truck  was  apparently
repaired  and  sold  at  auction.  Credit  reports  show  that  $24,381  was  charged  off.  The
August  2020  TransUnion  credit  report  lists  a  balance  of  $29,568,  but  the  September
2020 Equifax credit report lists a balance of $24,381. Applicant lost the $20,000 down
payment  on  the  truck,  but  he  never  paid  what  was  apparently  the  deficiency  owed  on
the loan. There is no evidence that the finance company has actively pursued collection
of the debt. (Tr. at 23-27, 35, 39-48, 54, 56-58; GE 1-3, 6, 7; AE A, I
Applicant denied owing the three remaining debts. His wife handles most of their
financial  matters.  She  credibly  testified  that  she  lost  one  of  her  wallets  with  several
credit  cards  in  about  2015.  She  was  an  authorized  user  on  some  credit  cards.  They
continued to pay the accounts for a period before she realized what had happened. She
believes  the  two  credit  card  debts  and  possibly  the  telecommunications  debt  resulted
from the  lost  wallet.  (Tr.  at  27-30,  39,  48-53,  56,  58-63;  Applicant’s  response to  SOR;
GE 1, 6)
The  $5,623  charged-off  home  improvement  store  credit  card  debt  became
delinquent in April 2016. The creditor issued an IRS Form 1099-C (Cancellation of Debt)
in  July  2019,  which  cancelled  $4,821  in  debt.  The  income  from  the  cancellation  was
addressed  in  Applicant’s  and  his  wife’s  income  tax  returns.  The  most  recent  credit
reports show the account with a $0 balance. The September 2020 Equifax credit report
indicates,  “Consumer  disputes  –  reinvestigation  in  progress.”  (Tr.at  27-28;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1-3, 6, 7; AE I, J, L)
The two remaining debts are reported on the August 2020 TransUnion report that
was  provided  by  Applicant  and  introduced  as  GE  7.  The  warehouse  store  credit  card
account  became  delinquent  in  about  August  2015.  Applicant  and  his  wife  denied  ever
having an account with the telecommunications company. The August 2020 TransUnion
credit report indicates that it was placed for collection in January 2020. It does not show
when  the  debt  became  delinquent,  but  it  indicates  that  the  debt  is  estimated  to  be
removed in September 2021, which would appear to indicate the debt is about six years
old. (Tr. at 28, 49-50, 63-64; GE 2, 3, 7)
Applicant  has  been  disputing  debts  on  his  credit  report  since  at  least  2016.  He
has  not  been  successful  thus  far  in  having  any  of  the  alleged  debts  deleted.  His
finances  are  otherwise  stable.  He  is  current  on  his  mortgage  loan,  child  support,  and
income  taxes.  He  has  an  auto  loan  that  is  almost  paid,  and  he  does  not  have  a
significant amount of revolving debt. (Tr. at 28, 31, 61-63; GE 2, 3, 6, 7; AE C, K, M-P)
