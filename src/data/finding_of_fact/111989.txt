Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant did not file his federal
income tax returns as required for the 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 tax years (SOR 1.a).
In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation and requested a hearing. In
addition to the facts established by Applicant’s admission, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  38  years  old  and  has  been  employed  by  the  defense  contractor
currently sponsoring his request for clearance since August 2016. After graduating from
college  in  2005  with  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  engineering,  he  received  an  officer’s
commission in the United States Navy. Between 2005 and 2011, Applicant was stationed
aboard ship and in shore assignments at various locations in the United States. Applicant
was  raised  in State A and lived there  until he graduated from college and entered the
Navy. He maintained State A as his home of record throughout his military career and
until he returned from overseas in 2018. While stationed in State B between 2005 and
2008, he bought a house in which to live during that assignment. When he left State B for
his next assignment, he kept the house as a rental property. Between October 2011 and
his honorable discharge from active duty in September 2014, Applicant was stationed in
a foreign country. After leaving active duty, he remained in that country, affiliating with a
Navy Reserve unit there while studying for a master’s degree in business administration
(MBA), which he received in June 2017. Applicant remained overseas for his first job with
his current employer until August 2018, when he relocated to his current residence in the
United States.  Applicant and  his wife were married in  November 2016 and  have a three-
year-old child. (GX 1; Tr. 29 –  34)
Applicant has held a security clearance since he began his military career in 2005.
His  eligibility  for  access  was  last  renewed  in  2011.  In  his  most  recent  clearance
application in November 2017, he disclosed that he had not timely filed his federal income
taxes for  the  2012,  2013,  2014,  and 2015  tax years.  He also stated that  in November
2017, he had filed his 2012, 2013, and 2015 returns, but was still waiting for information
he needed to complete his 2014 return. Available information shows that his 2012, 2013,
and 2014 returns were received by the IRS in March and April 2018. Despite Applicant’s
claim that he also submitted his 2015 return in 2017, available information shows that the
IRS did not receive his 2015 return until January 27, 2020. In his testimony on this issue,
Applicant reiterated his claim that he filed his 2015 return in 2017, further asserting that
there was some confusion in IRS processing of the 2015 return. In advance of his hearing,
he  resubmitted  that  return  by  registered  mail  on  September  6,  2020.  Applicant  also
testified that he filed all state and federal returns as required through the 2011 tax year
and that he has timely filed his returns for the tax years 2016 through 2020. At hearing,
Applicant  submitted  copies  of  his  federal  returns  for  2012  –  2015;  however,  those
documents are unsigned and undated products of an electronic filing system. After the
hearing, Applicant submitted an IRS transcript of Applicant’s 2015 tax filing activity that
reflects the aforementioned January 2020 filing date. Applicant testified that he has been
able to file his returns electronically through the IRS website without assistance. (GX 1 –
3; AX E; AX F; Tr. 22 – 23, 40 – 43)
Applicant claims he did not file the returns in question for three reasons. First, while
living and working overseas, he had difficulty receiving tax documents pertaining to his
State  B  rental  property  and  could  not  complete  his  2012  return.  Second,  Applicant
believed that because he knew he would be receiving refunds for excess taxes paid in
2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, and because he was living outside the United States, he did
not have to file returns for those years. Finally, Applicant believed that because his home-
of-record State A no longer taxed military income, he did not have to file a federal return.
Applicant  was  mistaken  on  all  three  counts.  He  further  has  claimed  that  when  he
submitted  his  November  2017  e-QIP,  he  realized  that  he  was  delinquent  in  his  tax
reporting  obligations  and  acted  to  compile  and  submit  his  past-due  returns.  When  he
submitted  his  e-QIP,  he  also  notified  his  company’s  security  manager  of  his  tax  filing
discrepancies. (GX 1; GX 3; AX C; Tr. 17 – 22)
As  to  his  understanding  of  State  A’s  tax  laws,  Applicant  testified  that  State  A
changed its tax laws regarding military income in 2010. Nonetheless, Applicant filed his
federal income tax returns as required for 2010 and 2011. Beginning with his 2012 tax
return,  the  first  return  he  should  have  filed  after  transferring  overseas  from  State  B,
Applicant  stated  he  had  difficulty  receiving  tax  documents  about  his  State  B  rental
property and could not complete his return. He did not indicate when or if he has since
received that information, but at the time he was able to determine based on previous
years’ returns that he would receive a refund for the 2012 tax year. Applicant’s only known
reason for not filing the other returns at issue here was a combination of his beliefs that if
he did not owe any taxes (or was due a tax refund), and if State B did not tax military
income, and if he was living outside the United States, he did not have to file returns. He
did not base those beliefs on any professional tax advice and he has not sought any such
advice or assistance in filing his past-due returns despite the fact such assistance was
readily available to him, at least while he was on active duty. Applicant also did not explain
why or how the act of submitting his most recent e-QIP caused him to realize his failure
to file his returns was incorrect. (AX C; Tr. 26 – 27, 34 – 40)
Applicant owes no unpaid taxes and his personal finances are sound. He recently
engaged the services of a financial counselor who assisted him in establishing a monthly
budget. There is no indication from the available information that Applicant owes unpaid
taxes to the IRS or any other tax authority. (AX E; Tr. 27)
Applicant provided four letters of support for his request for a clearance. Each of
his references stated they were familiar with the SOR allegation, but none had any direct
knowledge  of  Applicant’s  conduct  regarding  his  taxes.  Despite  the  government’s
concerns about his failure to file his tax returns, each reference endorsed and supported
Applicant’s  request  for  clearance.  They  each  cited  their  experience  with  Applicant’s
reliability, professionalism, integrity, and hard work as the reasons they had no concerns
recommending Applicant for access to classified information. (AX D)
