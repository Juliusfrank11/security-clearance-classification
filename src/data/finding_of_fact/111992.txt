Applicant,  age  49,  is  married  and  has  two  adult  children.  He  completed
requirements for an undergraduate degree in May 2018 and obtained his degree. (Answer
to FORM, D) He accomplished this while working full time. He served in the United States
Navy from 1989 until 2009, when he retired honorably. Applicant completed  a security
clearance application on February 9, 2018. (Item 3) He is currently working for a federal
contractor, which he began in 2018. He initially held a security clearance in the military
and maintained his clearance after retirement in the contracting field. (Items 2 and 3)
The SOR alleges that Applicant has five delinquent debts and two judgments for a
total amount of debt of $87,000. Applicant admits all the SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.a through
1.g, and provides explanations. (Item 1)
Applicant  attributes  his  financial  difficulties,  his  inability  to  maintain  financial
stability, and pay all his debts to a “rough patch” in 2014, 2015, and 2016. His wife was
not working; he housed his mother-in-law who had stage-four cancer; and his father-in-
law who was unemployed. In addition, he admits that he overextended himself financially.
(Answer to FORM) He paid for medical treatments for his mother-in-law that exacerbated
his financial difficulties. Applicant admits to making some poor judgments.
Applicant  stated  that  he  did  not  try  to  escape  from  his  financial  obligations.  He
attempted  to  reduce  expenses  by  modifying  his  home  mortgage.  He  failed  to  do  so,
moved out, and rented another place. He had rented a small apartment for his wife on the
mainland because he was to be transferred there by his command. However, the transfer
did not take place. He could not maintain the home mortgage loan and the rent. (Item 3)
Before the home went to foreclosure, Applicant was able to sell it. Applicant admits that
he should have acted sooner. His in-laws do not live with him now. It is not clear when
they  left  Applicant’s  home,  but  it  was  sometime  after  2016.  His  wife  is  now  working.
(Answer to FORM)
He admits being scared and stressed and not able to navigate his way. (Answer
to FORM) Applicant realizes that this is not an excuse. He also discusses having major
repairs with his vehicles and the need to purchase a car in 2016, which also exacerbated
his financial difficulties. He regrets not seeking legal help sooner for the vehicle issue. In
2018, Applicant was unemployed for a short period for health reasons. (Answer to FORM)
Applicant has a budget and provided a bill-paying checklist. The documents shows
his  creditors and  the  amounts  he  is  currently  paying  on  the  accounts.  It  also  shows  a
monthly net total income of about $11,000, including military retirement pay and military
disability pay. He has a net remainder. (Answer to FORM, E)
Applicant’s combined credit report reflects that he has multiple accounts that were
paid as agreed. Some of these accounts go back as far as 2003. (Item 4) The delinquent
debts  originated  on  his  credit  report  after  the  2014,  2015,  and  2016,  events  that  are
described in the finding of facts above.
For SOR ¶ 1.a, Applicant had a November 2, 2018 judgment entered against him
in the approximate amount of $36,353. This judgment is the result of an automobile loan
that Applicant obtained in 2016. The account was past due, and the car was repossessed.
Applicant  has  been  making  payments  to  the  debt  collector  since  August  2018.  He
provided an account summary reflecting that he has paid a total of $1,600 with consistent
monthly payments of $200 since 2018. (Answer to FORM, A)
As  to  SOR  ¶  1.b,  Applicant  admits  the  2014  judgment  entered  against  him  for
$7,849 for non-payment of a home owner association debt. He paid the account in full in
June 2017 from the proceeds of the sale of the home property. (Item 1)
As to SOR ¶ 1.c, Applicant admits that he is indebted for a charged-off account in
the amount of $29,268 for a consolidation loan. The consolidation loan was obtained from
the  same  institution  as  listed  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.  Applicant  has  been  making  $200  monthly
payments consistently since August 2018 to the debt collector. He provided an account
summary reflecting a total of $1,400 paid on the account. (Answer to FORM, A)
.
As to SOR ¶ 1.d, Applicant admits he is indebted for an account that is past due in
the amount of approximately $406, with a total balance of $4,626. He states that he has
been  current  on  this  account  for  several  months  and  provided  a  March  2020  account
summary to show nothing past due and a record of payments made on the account. (Item
1)
The  charged-off account  in  SOR  ¶  1.e, for $4,626,  is the  result  of a  credit  card
account. Applicant provided a confirmation of electronic transfers from his bank deposit
account. The payment plan shows the payments starting in July 2020 and continuing until
April 2023. He provided documentation of one payment of $128.51 made in June, 2020.
(Answer to FORM)
The charged-off account in SOR ¶ 1.f in the amount of $482.27 is in a repayment
status. Applicant made his first payment of $96.40 on April 2, 2020. (Item 1) He stated
that he has eight payments remaining.
As  to  the  SOR  allegation  in  ¶  1.g,  for  a  charged-off  account  in  the  amount  of
$9,005,  Applicant  admits  that  he  initially  incurred  this  debt.  However,  he  contests  the
amount owed. He takes responsibility because it is in his name. He explained the cause
of the debt in his subject interview in great detail. (Item 3) In 2016, he traded in his vehicle
for  another  car.  He  presented  documentation  that  part  of  the  agreement  was  a  down
payment of $6,000 cash, and the trade in. (Answer to FORM, C) The car dealer was to
take the vehicle that was traded, sell it, and pay off the balance of the loan. (Answer to
SOR) The agreement was not honored, and Applicant has attempted to resolve this issue
since  at  least  2017.  The  car  dealer  wanted  another  $6,000,  which  Applicant  did  not
possess.
Applicant has been working with a law firm to resolve the financial issue raised in
SOR 1.g. (Answer to FORM, C) Since 2017, Applicant has made many efforts to resolve
this matter. The law firm contacted the car dealer, who promising to resolve the issue,
has not. The sales contract confirms Applicant’s description of the event. He provided a
letter  from  his  attorney  and  the  2016  sales  contract.  His  legal  team  advises  that  the
original car dealer is liable for the balance of the car loan and not the Applicant. The letter
from his attorney refers to an unfair and deceptive trade practice. (Answer to FORM, C)
Applicant intends to resolve the matter with the assistance of the law firm.
