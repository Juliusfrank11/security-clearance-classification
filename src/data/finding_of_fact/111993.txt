In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since March 2019. He is currently a trainee, awaiting a decision on
his application for a security clearance. (Tr. 20.) He graduated from high school in June
1991. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from July 1991 to March 1997, and in
the  Army  National  Guard  from  March  1997  to  August  1998.  He  received  honorable
discharges for both periods of service.
Applicant  held  several  non-federal  jobs,  many  of  them  entry-level  or  minimum
wage, from August 2004 to January 2010, July 2011 to November 2018, and from January
to March 2019. He was unemployed from January 2020 to July 2011 and November 2018
to January 2019. His SCA reflects that he has never held a security clearance. (GX 1 at
31.)
Applicant married in February 1994 and divorced in February 2001. He has two
children, ages 26 and 22. He was required to pay child support of $600 per month starting
around 1998 or 1999 and ending in 2018. (Tr. 29, 46-47.)
Applicant’s SCA reflects that he has no college credits. However, he testified that
he attended college for about three years, and his credit reports reflect multiple student
loans opened in December 2006. (Tr. 26, 56; GX 2 at 2-3; GX 3 at 203.) He dropped out
of college so that he could work full time and pay his child support and living expenses.
(Tr. 56-57.)
The SOR alleges four delinquent debts reflected in credit reports from May 2019
and December 2019. (GX 2 and 3.) The evidence concerning these debts is summarized
below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: credit-card account placed for collection of $394, reflected in GX
3 at 4. When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in May 2019, he told
the investigator that he did not recognize this debt. (GX 4 at 1.) In his answer to the SOR,
he admitted it, but it appears that he thought it was another credit-card account that was
not alleged in the SOR. At the hearing, he testified that  his only credit-card account is
current and has never been delinquent. (Tr. 31.) The credit report from May 2019 reflects
two credit cards with the same generic name but issued by different banks. The first credit-
card  account  is listed  as  current;  the  second  is  listed  as  referred  for  collection  in  April
2019. (GX 3 at 2, 4.) The second account is alleged in the SOR. The credit report from
December 2019 reflects the first account as  current, does not list  the second account,
and reflects that Applicant has no debts in collection status. (GX 2.)
SOR ¶ 1.b: cellphone account placed for collection of $1,491, reflected in GX
3 at 5. Applicant admitted that he had an account with this cellphone provider and that he
fell behind on his payments. The credit reports reflect that the debt became delinquent in
June 2013 and was referred for collection in August 2016. (GX 2 at 1; GX 3 at 5.) When
he  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in  May  2019,  he  said  that  he  did  not
recognize the  debt.  (GX 4 at 1.)  He  testified that  he had never  been contacted  by the
creditor or a collection agency. (Tr. 32.) After the hearing, Applicant submitted evidence
that he paid the collection agency $497 on September 9, 2020, to settle this debt. (AX B.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d: delinquent student loans, one placed for collection of
$45,640  and  the  other  180  days  past  due  for  about  $9,436.  (GX  3  at  2,  4,  and  5.)
Applicant testified that he believes the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d is included in the debt
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. (Tr. 35-36.) His belief is supported by the May 2019 credit report
and the December 2019 credit report, both of which reflect a zero balance for the debt
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d and recite that the loan was assigned to the government. (GX 2 at
2-3; GX 3 at 4.) When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in May 2019,
he stated that  he fell behind  on  his  student  loan  payments  in 1997,  during his divorce
proceedings, and he began making payments of $60 per week in July 2002. (GX 4 at 1.)
He  submitted  no  documentary  evidence  of  payments.  He  testified  that  his  tax  refunds
have been diverted to pay these debts and his pay has been garnished. He was not sure
about the amount of the garnishment. (Tr. 37.) He testified that he has not approached
the lenders about a payment plan because he will not have a job if his application for a
security clearance is denied. (Tr. 39-40.) After the hearing, he submitted evidence that he
had applied for a federal direct consolidation loan on September 9, 2020. (AX A.)
Applicant’s  current  take-home  pay  is  about  $2,400  per  month.  (Tr.  41.)  His  net
monthly remainder after paying all living expenses is between $800 and $900 per month.
(Tr. 44.) He has accumulated about $3,000 in his checking account. He does not have a
savings account or any investments. (Tr. 45.) He paid off the loan for his 15-year-old car
in 2017. (Tr. 45.) The December 2019 credit report reflects no delinquent accounts except
for the cellphone debt alleged in SOR ¶1.b and his student loans.
