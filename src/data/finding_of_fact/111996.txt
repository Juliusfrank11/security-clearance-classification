Applicant,  age  55,  divorced  in  2005.  She  has  two  adult  children.  She  earned  a
bachelor’s degree in 1987. She was granted a DOD security clearance in 2005. Although
the record does not mention when or why that clearance lapsed, there is no indication
that  it  was  terminated  for  cause.  This  is  her  first  application  for  a  public  trust  position.
While she is currently unemployed, her application is being sponsored by a prospective
employer. (Items 2, 3; FORM Response)
Applicant  admitted  each  of  the  delinquent  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  totaling
$58,960,  including  a $369 utility  account;  a $2,199 auto-loan account;  nine credit-card
accounts  totaling  $45,748;  and  delinquent  federal  taxes  totaling  $10,644.  These  debts
remain unresolved. She has not sought any financial counseling. After consulting with an
attorney in 2015 to discuss her bankruptcy options, she decided not to file. Instead she
plans to “chip away” at her SOR debts, which will become a priority, once she becomes
gainfully employed again. She expects that she will be “out of debt . . . in no time” with
the income she expects to receive from her prospective employer. (Item 2; Item 4 at 9;
FORM response)
Applicant attributed her indebtedness to extended periods of unemployment and
underemployment that began in about 2014. During these times, she withdrew funds from
her retirement account and used credit cards to “keep afloat” and pay bills. She prioritized
paying  her  current  expenses,  resolving  her  home  mortgage  debt  to  avoid  foreclosure
twice,  and  financially  supporting  her  children  through  college,  over  repaying  her  SOR
debts. (Item 2; Item 4 at 17; FORM Response)
Prior to a March 2012 layoff, Applicant was gainfully employed in the same position
for almost eight years. She was unemployed for two months between March 2012 and
May 2012, 11 months between March 2013 and February 2014 (after she was fired for
performance  issues),  and  10  months  between  March  2018  and  January  2019  (after
another  layoff).  She  has  been  unemployed  since  November  2019  for  reasons  not
specified in the record. Applicant reported that, between February 2014 and June 2017,
her salary was $25,000 less than what she earned from her two prior employers. Despite
the substantial salary differential, she stayed in that position, in part, because she loved
the job so much. She did not otherwise detail her income history in the record. (Item 2;
Item 4 at 8, 14; FORM Response)
Applicant also did not enumerate her expense history in the record. However, her
credit reports revealed that she has neither incurred any new debts nor opened any new
accounts since 2017, and is managing her current finances responsibly without the use
of credit cards. She has owned her home since 2005. As of January 2020, both her first
and second mortgage-loan accounts were in good standing with the help of a “large sum
of money” that she borrowed from her father and  a lender-approved loan modification.
Her combined monthly payment was $894, and the remaining balances were $137,335
and $29,344, respectively. Applicant opened five federal student-loan accounts between
2013 and 2017, totaling $21,550, which were in deferment status in January 2020. The
record suggests that the student loans were opened for the benefit of at least one of her
children.  In  January  2020,  Applicant  had one auto-loan  account  (opened in 2014)  that
was in good standing, with a $284 monthly payment and a $2,142 remaining balance.
(Item 2 at 4; Item 4 at 12; Items 6-8)
During her unemployment period in 2012, Applicant was financially supported by
funds withdrawn from her retirement account. Between March 2013 and February 2014,
she  was  supported  by  unemployment  benefits  and  retirement  funds.  Between  March
2019  and  December  2018,  she  was  supported  by  unemployment  benefits.  From
September  or October  2018 through at  least  February 2019,  Applicant  earned income
working for a ride-sharing company on the weekends. Since November 2019, she has
been supported by unemployment benefits and “a little bit of help” from her family. When
she withdrew funds at various times from her retirement account, she incurred taxes and
early withdrawal fees. The record did not specify the amounts of her retirement account
withdrawals  and  associated  fees,  unemployment  benefits,  part-time  income,  or  family
support. (Item 2 at 4; Item 4 at 8, 16)
Applicant is indebted to the IRS in the amount of $10,644 for delinquent federal
income taxes for tax years (TY) 2014 through 2016. In her SOR answer, she claimed that
her TY 2019 refund was applied to reduce the balance to $9,002. In her FORM response,
she  claimed  that  the  balance  had  been  further  reduced  to  $5,823  for  reasons  not
specified. She did not provide any documents to corroborate her claims. Applicant plans
to make monthly payments to resolve her tax debts as soon as she begins working again.
(Item 2; Item 4 at 28-30)
Applicant  experienced  issues  paying  her  federal  income  taxes  beginning  in  TY
2012 and initiated efforts to resolve her delinquencies at various times since then. She
established an installment agreement with the IRS to repay her TY 2012 debt in August
2013. She made four payments totaling $1,395 in 2013. She paid $200 in 2014 and $100
in 2015. In September 2015, her first agreement lapsed and a tax lien was issued. She
established a second installment agreement in October 2015, which lapsed in November
2016. After a tax lien was issued, she established a third installment agreement in June
2017. She made four payments totaling $719 in 2017. She made $200 monthly payments
between January and August 2018. Refunds from federal taxes she paid in TY 2013 and
2017 totaling $2,755 were applied to her TY 2012 debt, which was resolved in August
2018. (Item 4 at 18-20, 30-31)
Applicant established an installment agreement with the IRS to repay her TY 2014
debt in October 2015. She paid $30 to the IRS in July 2016. Her first agreement lapsed
in  November  2016.  After  a  tax  lien  was  issued  in  May  2017,  Applicant  established  a
second installment agreement in June 2017. Refunds totaling $4,948, from federal taxes
she paid in TY 2012, 2017, and 2018, were applied to her TY 2014 debt in April 2018,
August 2018, and April 2019. For a period between August 2018 and October 2019, her
TY  2014  account  was  in  “not  collectible”  status.  The  TY  2014  account  has  been
considered collectible since October 2019. (Item 4 at 21-22, 30-31)
Neither direct payments to the IRS nor refunds from other tax years were applied
towards Applicant’s TY 2015 and 2016 debts. After a tax lien was issued in May 2017,
she established an installment agreement for TY 2015. That agreement lapsed in August
2018. For a period between August 2018 and October 2019, her TY 2015 account was in
“not  collectible”  status.  The  TY  2015  account  has  been  considered  collectible  since
October 2019. She has not established any installment agreements for TY 2016. (Item 4
at 23-24).
Applicant  did  not  timely  file  her  federal  or  state  income  tax  returns  for  TY 2016
through 2018. She did not timely file in TY 2016 because she knew that she would owe
extra  money  due  to  having  withdrawn  funds  from  her  retirement  account.  She  did  not
specify the reasons that she failed to timely file in TY 2017 and 2018. She filed her TY
2017 returns in July 2018, and her TY 2016 and 2018 returns in November 2019. Because
her failure to timely file her returns was not alleged in the SOR, I will consider it only to
evaluate mitigation and the whole person concept. (Item 4 at 2-3, 9, 25-27)
Applicant’s paycheck was garnished by State A in 2015 for delinquent state income
taxes for TY 2014. State A also garnished her paycheck in 2017 for delinquent taxes for
TY 2015 through 2016. As of January 2020, she owed no taxes to State A for TY 2012
through 2018. The record did not specify the amount of delinquent state taxes that were
paid by Applicant either directly or via the garnishments. (Item 4 at 10, 15, 32-38)
Applicant  has  spent  more  than  half  of  her  career  working  for  various  defense
contractors  in  support  of  the  U.S.  Navy.  She  proffered  that  she  is  “very  loyal  and
trustworthy”  and  has  a  “top  notch  work  ethic.”  She  described  herself  as  “dependable,
determined,  passionate,  and  honest.”  She  asserted  that  she  is  “wholeheartedly”
committed to making a difference by continuing to serve the federal government. (Item 2;
FORM response)
