Applicant  denied  the  six  allegations  contained  in  the  SOR  on  the  basis  that  the
statute  of  limitations  (SOL)  expired  on  the  delinquent  debts  and  that  he  is  no  longer
obligated to pay them. (Item 2)
Applicant is 55 years old and has been married since 1996. He has five children.
He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1985 to 1989 and received an honorable
discharge. He has been steadily employed since 2010, with the exception of one month
in  2017  when  he  was  unemployed  between  positions.  In  January  2019,  he  started  a
position with a defense contractor. (Item 3)
Applicant attributed his delinquent debts to medical bills he accumulated between
2012 and 2013, when his son experienced serious mental health issues resulting in in-
patient  and  outpatient  treatment.  Applicant’s  medical  insurance  did  not  cover  many  of
those bills, so he paid them. As a consequence, he did not have sufficient money to pay
his family’s living expenses and maintain payments on debts. He contemplated filing a
Chapter  13  bankruptcy,  but  determined  it  would  be  to his  financial  benefit  to  allow  the
SOL to expire on the debts, which would eliminate his legal responsibility for them. (Item
2 at 3)
During a background interview in May 2019, Applicant stated his financial status
was  “healthy.”  (Item  4  at  5)  He  told  the  interviewer  that  he  contributes  to  his  401(k)
pension plan and stays on a budget. He has not participated in financial counseling. (Id.)
Based on an April 2019 credit bureau report (CBR), the SOR alleged six delinquent
debts  that  totaled  about  $32,000  and  arose  between  2010  and  2016.  Applicant  stated
that  some  debts  were  cancelled,  that  he  received  Internal  Revenue  Forms1099-C  for
them,  and  he  paid  taxes  on  them.  (Item  2  at  3)  He  did  not  submit  documentation
confirming those assertions.
Applicant  submitted  a  February  2020  CBR  to  show  that  many  of  the  alleged
delinquent  debts  are  no  longer  listed  by  that  agency.  (AE  A)  However,  that  CBR  still
shows the delinquent debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d for $1,129 , and lists his last payment as
June 2013.
