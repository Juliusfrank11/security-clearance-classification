Applicant, 62, is a logistics analyst employed by a federal contractor since August
2017. He served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from December 1984 until he
retired in January 2005. While on active duty, he was awarded numerous medals and
commendations.  He  earned  his  bachelor’s  degree  in  2002  and  his  master’s  degree  in
2015, and was enrolled in a technical institute from 2015 until 2016. He is divorced and
has three adult children. He previously held a security clearance while on active duty and
while working for the government. (GX 1.)
The SOR alleges two debts: SOR ¶ 1.a is a past-due mortgage loan for $60,036
and SOR ¶ 1.b is a charged-off car-lease debt for $9,226. Applicant denies SOR ¶ 1.a
stating that he rehabilitated the account, and admits SOR ¶ 1.b with an explanation. The
debts are reflected in Applicant’s October 2019 credit bureau report (CBR) (GX 5).
The SOR further alleges that Applicant tested positive for cocaine in June 2017,
was reprimanded by his employer in 2014 and 2015 for failing to appear at work and for
submitting improper timesheets, and was also reprimanded by his employer in 2014 for
the unauthorized use of a government sponsored credit card. In his answer, Applicant
admits these allegations. However, in his response to the FORM, Applicant explains that
he  was  reprimanded  twice,  once  in  2014  for  unauthorized  use  of  his  government-
sponsored  credit  card  and  once  in  2015  for  failing  to  appear  at  work  and  submitting
improper  timesheets  in  2013  and  2015.  The  underlying  facts  of  these  reprimands  and
suspensions are discussed more fully below. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact.
After  retiring  from  the  Marine  Corps,  Applicant  was  employed  by  a  federal
contractor from 2005 until 2009, when he obtained a position with a federal government
agency.  Following  the  Washington  Navy  Yard  shooting  in  September  2013,  Applicant
misunderstood the guidance for reporting in, and failed to timely contact his supervisor. It
was  later  determined  by  Applicant’s  employer  that  Applicant  was  absent  from  work
without  authorization  and  that  he  failed  to  properly  submit  his  timesheets.  In  2014,
Applicant used his government-sponsored credit card for $260 of unauthorized charges.
He promptly repaid this account in full. However, these two actions resulted in Applicant’s
employer reprimanding Applicant and suspending him for five days in June 2014.
In March 2015, there was a snowstorm and Applicant lost power to his home. He
was under the mistaken impression that the base where he was employed was closed
due to the inclement weather conditions. He did not report to work and did not contact his
supervisor  until  his  power  was  restored.  Applicant’s  employer  took  into  account
Applicant’s prior conduct that resulted in his 2014 reprimand, and reprimanded him with
a suspension for 10 days. He remained employed by this federal agency until November
2016. Applicant fully disclosed the circumstances of his two reprimands and suspensions
on his e-QIP. He regrets his actions and has no intention of engaging in any similar future
conduct.
In November 2016, Applicant left his position with a federal agency to pursue other
opportunities, but was not immediately successful. He was unemployed from November
2016  until  July  2017.  During  this  period  of  unemployment,  Applicant  experienced
significant financial strains and was unable to maintain his mortgage loan and automobile
lease payments.
In  2016,  Applicant  contacted  the  creditor  for  his  automobile  lease,  returned  the
vehicle, and paid the early termination fee for the lease. He thought the lease account
was satisfied and closed. It was not until he received the SOR that he became aware of
the outstanding balance of $9,226 (SOR ¶ 1.b) on this account. He again contacted the
creditor and was told that the creditor had sold the vehicle and charged off the account.
The creditor informed Applicant that it would accept payment in full on the charged-off
account. This account remains unresolved.
In  December  2018,  Applicant   entered  a  repayment  agreement  for  his  $60,036
delinquent  mortgage  loan  (SOR  ¶  1.a).   His  monthly  payments  are  $200.  Applicant’s
mortgage lender stated in  a letter from  April 2020 that Applicant was in  compliance with
the agreement and the loan balance was $32,142. (Answer.)
Applicant’s CBR shows a credit history dating back to 2000 that includes paid off
personal loans, vehicle loans, credit cards, and current student loans. Applicant has not
incurred any other delinquent accounts since his 2016-2017 period of unemployment. He
is current on all his open accounts. (GX 5.)
During  his  period  of  unemployment,  Applicant  became  “depressed  and
disillusioned about [his] possibilities  and  future.”  While attending a party in  June 2017,
someone offered Applicant cocaine and he used it. Applicant deeply regrets this conduct.
Shortly after this single use of cocaine, he tested positive during a pre-employment drug
screening. He stated that he has “not been involved with any of this type of activity before,
or since.” He recognizes the negative impact such conduct could have on his family, his
community  and  himself.  He  has  no  future  intention  of  any  illegal  drug  use.  He  fully
disclosed this conduct on his e-QIP.
