Applicant  admitted  SOR  allegations  ¶¶  1.a,  1.c,  1.d,  and  1.f.  He  denied
allegations  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.e.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,
exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  71-year-old  employee  of a defense  contractor.  He  is  married and
has  two  adult  children.  Applicant  was  born  in  Pakistan  in  1949,  entered  the  United
States in 1973, and became a naturalized American citizen in 1982. He has a master’s
degree.  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  June  2018.  He
does  not  currently  hold  a  security  clearance,  but  has  held  one  in  the  past.  (Item  3  at
Sections 1-4, 9, and 13B; Applicant Exhibit A.)
Applicant  worked  as  a  Federal  civilian  employee  from  1982  to  1990,  and  again
from  2005  to  2012.  Applicant  worked  overseas  in  the  Persian  Gulf  area  from  2005  to
August  2014,  and  again  from  September 2015  to  January  2018.  Applicant  returned  to
the United States full-time in January 2018. (Item 3 at Sections 11 and 13B; Applicant
Exhibit A.)
1.a. Applicant has two brothers and four sisters. Except for one brother, all of his
remaining  family  now  lives  in  the  United  States.  His  brother  retired  from  the  Pakistani
Army as an officer in 2017. Applicant has not seen this brother since he returned to the
United States in January 2018. His only contact with this brother since then is through
social media.  (Item 2; Item 4; Applicant Exhibit A.)
1.b.  The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant’s  son  resided  in  Saudi  Arabia.  Applicant
stated  that  his  son  returned  to  the  United  States  in  2017.  The  Government  conceded
that  this  allegation  has  been  mitigated.  Accordingly,  it  is  found  for  Applicant.  (Item  2;
FORM at footnote 1.)
1.c.  The  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  maintained  close  and  continuing
contact  with  various  friends  and  family  members  in  Pakistan.  In  this  regard  Applicant
stated,  “Since  2018,  there  is  ONLY  minimal/infrequent  contacts  with  friends  and
relatives in Pakistan using social media (WhatsApp) for personal greetings.” (Applicant
Exhibit A at 1-2.)
The  following  three  allegations,  1.d,  1.e,  and  1.f,  concern  Applicant’s  financial
connections in Pakistan. For ease of discussion they will be addressed together. At the
time the SOR was issued in February 2020, Applicant had cash and property assets in
Pakistan worth between $140,000 and $160,000. This included $22,000 in several bank
accounts;  an  apartment  owned  by  Applicant’s  wife  worth  approximately  $70,000;  and
property  that  was  alleged  to  be  worth  $111,000,  but  due  to  currency  deflation  in
Pakistan had been reduced to approximately $70,000. (Item 5.)
Applicant  submitted  documentation  from  his  bank  in  the  United  States  showing
that  approximately  $100,000  had  been  remitted  from  his  Pakistani  bank.  Applicant
stated that only approximately $20,000 remained in Pakistan as of June 29, 2020, and
that  amount  was  in  the  process  of  being  transferred.  (Applicant  Exhibit  A.)  Item  5
indicated  that  Applicant  had  approximately  $601,000  worth  of  assets  in  the  United
States, before transfer of the funds from Pakistan.
Pakistan
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  facts  set  forth  in  Item  6.  Pakistan  is  a
parliamentary federal republic, created in 1947 after British India was partitioned when
the  British  government  granted  India  its  independence.  Pakistan  was  created  for  the
Moslem population of the Indian sub-continent. Its population is about 170 million. After
September 11, 2001, Pakistan reassessed its relations with the Taliban and supported
the U.S. and international coalition in its efforts to remove the Taliban from power. Many
Islamic  extremists  and  terrorists  are  known  to  inhabit  parts  of  Pakistan,  leading  to  a
growth of their insurgency. Although Pakistan has intensified its efforts to deal with the
violence and terrorists, the country continues to experience serious problems. The U.S.
Department  of  State  confirms  that  many  border  cities  are  known  as  safe  havens  for
terrorists. Numerous suicide bombings and kidnappings have taken place over the past
years. Human rights violations continue to be a significant problem, as killings, torture,
and  disappearances  remain  prevalent.  The  Pakistani  government  maintains  domestic
intelligence surveillance activities. The U.S. government warns Americans against travel
to Pakistan.
