The  SOR identified  three  allegations  under this guideline  concerning  Applicant’s
failure to  file  his  Federal and state  income  tax  returns for tax  years   2007, 2008, 2009,
2010,  2011,  2012,  2013,  2014,  2015,  2016,  and  2017;  and   a   delinquent  medical  debt
that was  placed  for collection.   In  his  answer to  the  SOR,  Applicant admits  allegations
1.a.   and   1.b,  and   he   denied   allegation   1.c.,   asserting   that  the   debt  has   been   paid.
Applicant  has  no   prior  military   service.    He  has   primarily   worked   as  an   automobile
technician  from September 2005 to July 2011; and  from  September 2011 to the present.
1.a.,  and  1.b.  Applicant  explained  that  during  his  marriage  to  his  ex-wife,  from
September 2006 to February 2014, she would file their income taxes each year claiming
only  herself  and  their  children  in  order  to  receive  a  tax  refund.  She  would  keep  the
refund for her spending.  Instead of filing and owing taxes, Applicant simply did not file
income tax returns.  Applicant stated, “I failed  to  take  adequate  action  to  curb her [his
wife’s] behavior.”  (Government Exhibit 2.)  For eleven years,  Applicant allowed  her to
continue  these  false  tax  filings  during  and  after  their  marriage.  Applicant  was  aware
that  her  false  tax  filings  would  cause  him  future  tax  problems.  Applicant  and  his  wife
divorced in 2014.  At some point, due to his ex-wife’s drug addiction, Applicant filed for
custody of his children.  The divorce and child custody matters caused Applicant serious
financial hardship which delayed his ability to address his tax issues.
In May 2017, at
the conclusion of the child custody case, Applicant was awarded full legal and physical
custody  of  their  two  children.  At  that  time  he  began  to  explore  his  options  on  how to
address his tax issues.
On June 13, 2018, Applicant hired a tax relief  company to guide and direct him
on how to resolve his tax issues.  (Government Exhibit 5 and Applicant’s Exhibit A.)  In
February 2019, when Applicant had completed payments for their services, the tax relief
company  began  working  to  resolve  Applicant’s  tax  problems.  Applicant  contends  that
he was advised by the tax relief program that he did not have to file his state or Federal
income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2007,  2008,  2009,  2010,  2011,  2012,  and  2013.
Applicant  submitted no  documentation for this assertion.  Applicant  states that he  was
required to file his state and Federal income tax for tax years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017,
and  2018.  He  provided  copies  of  those  income  tax  returns,  which  were  filed  in
November 2019.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  Applicant was told by the tax relief company
that  he  would  owe  approximately  $3,000  for  each  tax  year  that  he  did  not  file  a  tax
return.  They  are  currently  negotiating  a  settlement  with  the  tax  authorities  to  help
Applicant begin a repayment program.
Applicant  provided   several   documents   that   are  not  definitive   concerning   his
delinquent tax  indebtedness  to  the  state.  A  copy  of  a  check to  the  state  tax  authorities
dated   November  26,   2019,  shows  that  he   made   a   payment  in   the   amount  of   $373.
(Applicant’s  Exhibit  A.)     An   installment  bill   from   the   state   dated   February   18,  2020,
reflects  a   balance   due   of  $3,186.19,   with   a   required   monthly   payment   of  $102.42.
Applicant’s   bank  records   show   that  he   has  made   at  least  four  payments  toward  this
debt.   (Government Exhibit 2.)  He also submitted  a  remittance  notice  showing  a  refund
of   $732.39   was  issued   to   him   on   May   19,   2020   by   the   state.     (Applicant’s   Exhibit  A.)
Applicant  has   also  filed   his  2018   income   tax   returns.     Applicant  submitted   a   payment
agreement   which  sets   forth   a   payment  plan   of  $191.35   per  month   for  36   months,  the
first payment being due on June 15, 2020.
Regarding   his federal  back taxes,  Applicant submitted   a   bill from   the  IRS  dated
February   17,   2020,   indicating   that   he   owes  $1,146.07   for  tax   year  2017.   (Applicant’s
Exhibit  A.)   Applicant  stated   in  his  response   to   the   FORM   that  he   initially   wanted   to
negotiate  a  payment plan  of  $150  monthly, but the  IRS  requested  $250  monthly,  which
he  agreed upon.  At that time  he  was waiting  for the finalized  agreement from  the  IRS  in
order  to   begin  this  payment  plan.     (Government  Exhibit  2.)    There  is  nothing   in  the
record that confirms the total amount of  back taxes owed to the  federal government.
1.c.  A  delinquent medical debt  in  the  amount  of $114  that  was sent  to  collection
was paid in full  on  June  26, 2019, in the  amount of  $120.89.   A  transaction  record from
Applicant’s Capital One account reflects  this payment. (Government Exhibit 2.)
Applicant  admits  his  mistakes  of  the  past  and  states  that  they  will  not  be
duplicated.  He  states  that  this  tax  situation  has  caused  him  much  grief,  anxiety  and
money.  He also states that he started rectifying his tax situation well before he applied
for a government position. (Government Exhibit 2.)
