In  her  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted,  with  brief  comments,  all  of  the
factual  allegations  pertaining  to  financial  considerations  in  the  SOR  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  and
1.b.). Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete
and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same,
I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving
as  a  subcontract  administrator  with  her  current  employer  since  December  2018.  She
previously  worked  as  a  programs  purchasing  manager  from  December  2013  until
December  2018.  From  January  2005  until  February  2017,  she  was  a  part-time  office
manager  for  a  business  that  she  and  her  husband  owned.  While  her  high  school
educational background was not reported, she received an associate’s degree in 2012.
She has never served with the U.S. military.  She has never held a security clearance.
Applicant was married and divorced in 1995, and remarried in 2009, and again divorced
in 2017. She has one child, born in 1993.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can
be found in the following exhibits: Item 2 (Answer to the SOR, dated June 15, 2020); Item
3 (SF 86, dated January 14, 2019); Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated February
27, 2019); and Item 5 (Responses to Interrogatories, dated October 26, 2019).
As of June 15, 2020, when she answered the SOR, Applicant had failed to file her
federal income tax returns for the tax years 2016, 2017, and 2018, and she still owed the
Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  approximately  $12,868  in  unpaid  2015  income  taxes,
accrued interest, and accrued penalty. (Item 2) In January 2019, in her SF 86, Applicant
attributed  her  financial  issues  to  going  through  a  separation  and  divorce.  She  claimed
that she had contacted a tax relief company for help in resolving her 2015 issues, and
that she would start making monthly payments, and anticipated that the unpaid income
taxes would be paid within the next 36 months. (Item 3, at 34) With respect to the unfiled
2016 and 2017 federal income tax returns, she claimed to have filed for an extension for
2016,  but  missed  the  filing  date.  Both  federal  income  tax  returns  would  be  filed  either
“soon” or “very soon.” (Item 3, at 34) Neither action has yet been taken.
During  an  interview  with  an  investigator  from  the  U.S.  Office  of  Personnel
Management  (OPM)  on  February  27,  2019,  Applicant  acknowledged  that  she  had  not
paid the federal income taxes for 2015 through 2017. She claimed to be willing and able
to pay those federal income taxes, but contended that the 2015 debt was associated with
her husband’s business and solely that of her husband. She also stated that the federal
income  tax  returns  for 2016 and 2017 would  be filed during the 2018 tax filing period.
(Item  4,  at  1)  Those  actions  have  not  been  taken.  She  acknowledged  that  she  never
followed up with the tax relief company for help in resolving her 2015 issues. (Item 4, at
1)
With  respect  to  the  unpaid  federal  income  taxes  for  2016,  2017,  and  2018,
unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA
Appeal  Board.  (Conduct  not  alleged  in  an  SOR  may  be  considered:  (a)  to  assess  an
applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation,
or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to  consider  whether  an  applicant  has  demonstrated
successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative
Guidelines  is  applicable;  or  (e)  to  provide  evidence  for  whole-person  analysis  under
Directive § 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR
Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd.
Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing
ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327
at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant’s  unalleged and unpaid federal income taxes,
will be considered only for the five purposes listed above.
In her October 2019 responses to the interrogatories, Applicant acknowledged that
she had still not filed the federal income tax returns for 2016, 2017, and 2018. She also
stated  that  after  the  income  tax  returns  are  filed,  she  would  start  making  payments  to
cover any taxes left due. She planned for all actions to be “implemented” by the end of
November  2019.  (Item  5,  at  2)  As  of  October  30,  2020,  because  Applicant  failed  to
respond to the FORM, she has offered no evidence to indicate that those federal income
tax returns have yet been filed, or the payments made.
Although Applicant claimed to be willing and able to pay her federal income taxes,
it is not known what her current financial resources may be because she did not report
her current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder that might
be  available  for  discretionary  spending  or  savings.  There  is  no  evidence  of  a  budget.
There is no evidence of financial counseling.
