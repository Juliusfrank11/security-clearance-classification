Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e. He denied the SOR
allegations in ¶¶ 1.f through 1.p. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 30 years old. He graduated from high school in 2009 and received a
certificate of achievement from a technical school in 2013. He has been employed by a
federal contractor since April 2018. From 2013 to 2018, he worked for two different private
companies.  He  also  worked  from  2011  to  2013  while  attending  school.  Applicant
disclosed on his May 2018 security clearance  application (SCA) that he is not married
and does not cohabitate with anyone. He disclosed he has a child, five years old, and a
stepchild who is seven years old. (Item 3)
Applicant attributed his financial issues to a period when he was attending school,
was young, and he did not have the discipline or knowledge about finances. He stated in
his FORM response: “I am fully aware of most of my debt and did not make much effort
to resolve my debt until it was brought to my attention.” (AE A)
Applicant has approximately $45,000 of student loan debt. The loan amounts were
disbursed from 2011 to 2013 and the accounts are reported in his November 2019 credit
report  as  sold  or  transferred  in  2017.  Applicant  provided  a  document  to  show that  his
monthly payment is supposed to be $193. The document shows he made a payment of
$5  in August 2019; $35  in September 2019; and $5  in October 2019. He  stated in his
answer  to  the  SOR  that  the  accounts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.g  through  1.p  have  been
consolidated into one account, and he is making payments. In his FORM response, he
provided a copy of a budget that includes a payment of $193. He did not provide evidence
of  any  other  past  payments  or  that  he  has  been  making  his  budgeted  payment.  The
document  from  the  creditor  shows  that  the  past  due  amount  is  zero  and  the  current
balance owed is $46,992. It appears the creditor has agreed to accept minimal payments.
(Item 2, 5; AE A, D)
In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  stated  that  he  was  offered  a  settlement
agreement  from  the  creditor  for  the  debt  in  ¶  1.a  ($20,003)  if  he  made  consistent
payments for eight months. In his FORM response he provided a copy of an agreement
dated  June  2020,  which  requires  monthly  payments  of  $100.  The  document  shows  a
balance of  $19,803, so presumably  Applicant has made two payments. His November
2019 credit report shows the last activity on this debt was in 2015. (Items 2, 5; AE C)
The charged off debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($2,962) has been delinquent since 2016. He
stated  in  his  SOR  answer  that  he  has  a  weekly  payment  plan  to  satisfy  the  debt.  He
provided a copy of  a receipt showing he made one payment of $50 in April 2020. The
account is included in his budget with a prospective payment of $200. No other receipts
were provided to show additional payments. (Items 2, 5; AE D).
The charged off credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($1,061) has been delinquent since
approximately 2016. Applicant said that he intended to pay the debt with his Government
stimulus  check.  In  his  FORM  response,  he  stated  he  was  still  making  payment
arrangements with the creditor. It is included in his budget. (Items 2, 5; AE A, D).
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($5,700) is for a repossessed vehicle. Applicant stated in
his  answer  to  the  SOR  that  he  made  payment  arrangements  to  satisfy  the  debt.  He
provided  a  copy  of  an  agreement  dated  April  2020.  The  agreement  requires  he  make
payments of $190 a month, beginning in May 2020. The debt is included in his budget.
Applicant did not provide supporting documents that he made the first two payments for
May and June 2020, or any other payments. (Items 2, 5; AE A, D)
Applicant stated in his SOR answer that he had “a plan and action to pay off the
full amount” of the medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($585). (Item 2) In his FORM response, he
stated he would pay the bill within a month. He did not provide any documents to show
the debt is paid. (AE A)
Applicant denied he owed the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f ($147) stating it had been
paid. His November 2019 credit report shows the date of last activity on the account was
October 2018. In his FORM response he provided a receipt indicating the debt had been
satisfied. (Items 2, 5; AE B)
Applicant  stated  that  his  supervisor  has  assisted  him  in  making  a  budget.
Applicant’s budget shows a negative balance of $110. I have considered that his monthly
estimate for car repairs ($300) may not be a recurring expense. He stated in his FORM
response that he is making an effort to arrange payment plans and agreements for his
delinquent debts. (AE D)
