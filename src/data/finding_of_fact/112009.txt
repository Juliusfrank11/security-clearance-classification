Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges two debts: a $22,136 charged-off vehicle loan
and a $136,902 charged-off mortgage loan. Applicant admits each of these debts. The
delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant’s September 2018 and September 2019 credit
bureau reports (CBR) (GX 4; GX 5) and discussed in his personal subject interview (PSI).
(GX 3.) His admissions in his Answer are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant, 46, is a supervisor employed by a defense contractor since June 2018.
He has worked for federal contractors since at least January 2008. He served honorably
in  the  U.S.  Army  from  January  1993  until  July  2002.  He  received  two  aerospace
certifications in 2012. He was denied a security clearance in 2013 due to financial issues.
He married in 1996 and divorced in 2002. Applicant remarried in 2016. He has an adult
son and a 17-year-old daughter. (GX 2.)
In  February  2012,  Applicant  cosigned  a  vehicle  loan  for  his  then-girlfriend.
Applicant accepted a position to work overseas from October 2012 until October 2014.
He left his then-girlfriend in charge of his finances to include his mortgage loan, his truck
loan, and several consumer accounts. Applicant’s then-girlfriend did not pay the accounts,
including her vehicle loan on which Applicant was the cosigner and Applicant’s mortgage
loan.  (GX  2  through  5.)  Applicant’s  then-girlfriend  routinely  withdrew  money  from
Applicant’s  accounts  in  the  amounts  of  the  account  payments  that  were  due  which
resulted  in  Applicant’s  believing  that  she  was  timely  paying  his  accounts.  (GX  2.)
Applicant was informed by a relative of his then-girlfriend that his accounts were not being
paid in about October 2013. Applicant contacted the creditors and began attempting to
resolve the delinquent accounts. (GX 2; GX 3.)
The  $22,136  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  is  for  the  charged-off  vehicle  loan  that
Applicant cosigned for his then-girlfriend. Applicant was contacted in 2015 by an agent
attempting to recover the vehicle. Applicant explained to the agent that Applicant’s former
girlfriend was in possession of the vehicle and that he had not seen the vehicle since he
returned from overseas. He provided the agent with as much information as he had to
assist in the recovery of the vehicle. This debt was charged off to profit and loss in July
2017. (GX 2; GX 4.)
Upon  learning  that  his  accounts  were  delinquent,  Applicant  contacted  his
mortgage-loan lender and was informed that his loan was in foreclosure. He attempted to
resolve  the  account  but  was  informed  by  the  lender  that  it  was  too  late  to  stop  the
foreclosure process. The $136,902 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b was charged off to profit
and loss in July 2017. (GX 2.)
Applicant  was  also  delinquent  on  the  following  accounts:  an  $8,300  car  loan;  a
$5,300  car  loan;  a  $373  consumer  account;  a  $3,800  consumer  account;  a  $390
consumer account; a $362 cable bill; and a $500 credit-card account. He resolved the
majority of these accounts in 2013 and the final outstanding account in March 2017. (GX
2; GX 4.)
Applicant purchased his current house in June 2018 and is current on his mortgage
loan with no record of any late payments. He is current on all his open accounts, including
his child support payments, a credit card, and several consumer accounts. He lives within
his means and has not incurred any delinquent debt since 2013. (GX 4; GX 5.)
