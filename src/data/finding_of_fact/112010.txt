The  SOR (Item  1) alleges under Guideline  F that, as of  April 2, 2020, Applicant
owed  a  $179,4500  deficiency  balance  on  a  foreclosed  mortgage  loan  (SOR ¶  1.a) and  five
medical collection  debts  of  $951  (SOR ¶  1.b), $401 (SOR ¶ 1.c), $103 (SOR ¶ 1.d), $77
(SOR ¶ 1.e), and $61 (SOR ¶ 1.f).
When  he  responded  to  the  SOR, Applicant denied  the  alleged  debts.  He indicated
that  the   balances  were  erroneous,  and   that  the   debts  had   been  “cleared  by   the  credit
bureau”  and   no   longer  appeared   on   his  credit  reports.  He  provided   no   substantiating
documentation but asked the DOD to retrieve his credit report for confirmation. (Item  2.)
After considering  the  FORM  (excluding  the  PSI but including  Applicant’s Answer to
the  SOR), and  Applicant’s rebuttal to  the  FORM  (AE  A), I make  the  following  findings of
fact:
Applicant  is   a   45-year-old  immigrant  from   Haiti  who   finished   high   school  in  the
United  States in 1992. He is twice married  and  divorced  and  has no  children. Applicant
earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in May  2006  while  working  as a  risk and  security  administrator
in the  information  technology  sector. He began  working  for a  defense  contractor in March
2019  and  seeks a  security  clearance  for his duties as a  senior  cyber-security  engineer.
(Item  3.)
Applicant married  his first wife  in January  2001. It  is unclear whether Applicant was
employed   at  that  time.  In   March  2003,  he   began   working   as  a   risk  and   security
administrator for a  large  bank. (GE 3.) In  January  2007, Applicant executed  a  promissory
note,  and   he   and   his  first  wife   obtained   a   $123,971   30-year  mortgage   loan   securing
payment of  the  note. Monthly  mortgage  payments for their  home  were initially  $753  per
month  based on an interest rate of 6.125%. (Item  7.)
Applicant  and   his first  wife’s relationship  ended   in approximately   January   2008.
Applicant retained  possession  of  the  marital residence  following  their  divorce.  (Item  3.) In
February  2009, Applicant  obtained  a  modification  of  the  promissory n  ote  and  mortgage.
Under the new terms, he agreed to repay a principal loan balance of $129,844, initially at
$552 per month, with the loan to mature on March 1, 2049. The interest rate on the loan
was 4.125%. (Item 7.)
Applicant was married to his second wife from January 31, 2010 to December 1,
2012. From October 2011 to July 2012, Applicant was employed as an information security
administrator in the maritime industry. During that time, he traveled to Haiti for less than a
week in March 2012 to visit family or friends. (Item 3.) It is unclear whether his second wife,
also a native of Haiti, accompanied him.
Applicant lost his job with the maritime company in July 2012 due to a corporate
merger, but he started a new job as an information technology security analyst with an
investment company in August 2012. Based on available address information for Applicant,
he moved out of his home upon his divorce from his second wife in December 2012. (Item
3.) He continued to own the home, however, and, in December 2013, he obtained another
modification of the mortgage on the marital home shared with his first wife. Under the new
terms, he agreed to pay a principal loan balance of $154,857, initially at $647 per month.
The  loan’s new maturity  date  was November 1, 2053, and its interest rate was 4.00%.
(Item 7.) Applicant did not explain his rationale for increasing his mortgage obligation by
approximately $25,000.
In November 2014, Applicant traveled to Haiti for less than a week to visit family and
friends. In February 2015, Applicant was laid off from his job with the investment company.
Unemployed until October 2015, he went to Haiti for three or four weeks in March 2015 and
for less than one week in September 2015 to visit family and friends. He also took two
separate trips to Jamaica for volunteer activities for six to ten days in June 2015 and in
October 2015. (Item 3.)
Applicant made no mortgage payments after May 2015. In late October 2015, his
mortgage lender moved to foreclose on the property for nonpayment of the loan with a
principal balance of $151,644. In April 2017, the company servicing his loan obtained a
final judgment of foreclosure. With interest, expenses, costs, and fees, the balance of his
loan debt was $177,621. (Item 7.) A judgment lien was filed against Applicant and his first
wife in the amount of $151,644, the principal due on the note secured by the foreclosed
mortgage.  (Item  8.)  On  August  28,  2017,  the  loan  servicer  acquired  the  property  for
$80,600. (Item 7.)
From October 2015 to May 2018, Applicant worked as a contractor for a succession
of three companies. He traveled to Haiti for little over a week in August 2016 for volunteer
activities, and in December 2012, he went to Europe as a tourist. After his employment
contract ended in May 2018, Applicant was unemployed until March 2019. He traveled to
Cuba for tourism purposes in November 2018. (Item 3.)
In March 2019, Applicant began working for his defense-contractor employer. On
March  29,  2019,  he  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a  Questionnaire  for
Investigations Processing (SF 86). Applicant responded negatively to the SF 86’s financial
record inquiries concerning any delinquency involving enforcement, including whether he
had a lien placed against his property for failing to pay taxes or other debts in the last
seven years. He responded affirmatively to the financial record inquiries regarding any
delinquency  involving  routine  accounts  in  the  last  seven  years  and  listed  a  $49,267
mortgage delinquency on his marital home with his first wife and one medical debt that was
placed  for  collection  for  $501.  He  indicated  that  the  mortgage  had  been  resolved  in
December 2017 and that he was currently making payments on the medical debt. He gave
the following explanation for the mortgage delinquency:
My  financial mortgage  circumstances started  after the  divorce of  my  wife.
Prior to  our divorce we  were both  working  and  contributing  to  the  mortgage
and  household expenses. However, after our divorce the  mortgage  was still
under  my   name   and   I  struggled   to   pay   the   mortgage.   Therefore,  I  made
several attempts to  sell  the  home, however, my  ex-wife  was not willing  to
collaborate  in the  process of  selling  the  home. The  situation  got worse after
losing  my  job  and  I ended  [up] losing the home in foreclosure. Fortunately,
the   home   has  been   sold  at  fair   market   value   and   the   remaining   debt  of
$49,267.36  has been  discharged  by  the  bank resulting  in zero debt.  (Item  3.)
Regarding efforts to address that debt, Applicant stated:
I applied  for mortgage  modification  which helped  reduced  [sic]  the  mortgage,
however that was not enough  to  sustain my  financial situation  at the  time. I
spend   [sic]  a   few   days  negotiating   with   the   mortgage   company   on   a
resolution to stop the foreclosure process. However I did not have  the  total
amount required by the bank to reverse the foreclosure. (Item 3.)
A  check of  Applicant’s credit on  April 12, 2019, showed  Applicant’s mortgage  loan
as $32,081  past due  on  a  balance  of  $179,450  as of  October 2017. Applicant had  five
medical collection  debts on  his record: $951  from  April 2019; $401  from  June  2014  in
collection since September 2018; $103  from  October 2012  in collection  since  May  2013;
$77   from   May   2014   in  collection   since   December  2014;  and   $61   from   May   2014   in
collection  since  December 2014. Applicant was reportedly making timely payments on a
credit card with  a  disputed  balance  of  $2,710; on  a  secured  loan  obtained in September
2017  for $16,483  with  a  balance  of  $12,168; and  on  a  credit card with  a  $610  balance.
Applicant owed $26,819 on  six  deferred  student loans that had  been  delinquent in 2017.
(Item 6.)
As of November 16, 2019, Equifax was reporting Applicant’s foreclosed mortgage
loan  as  $32,081  past  due  on  a  $179,450  balance  as  of  October  2017.  His  monthly
mortgage  payment  obligation  was  reportedly  $895.  Applicant  was  continuing  to  make
timely payments of $429 per month on a secured loan (balance $10,902) and on two credit
cards with balances of $2,491 and $49. The balance on his student loans had risen to
$28,478, and his student loans were last delinquent in 2017. The medical collection debts
had been deleted from his credit record. (Item 5.)
The   DCSA   CAF  issued   an   SOR  to   Applicant  on   April  2,  2020,  because   of   the
delinquent  mortgage,  alleging   a   deficiency   balance   of   $179,450   (SOR  ¶   1.a), and  five
medical collection  debts totaling  $1,593  (SOR ¶¶  1.b-1.f). (Item  1.) In  response, Applicant
stated  on  April 27, 2020, that the reported debt balances were erroneous, and that all of
the  debts had  been  “cleared  by  the  credit bureau  and  [are] no  longer showing  in [his]  credit
report accounts.” (Item  2.)  He did not provide  with  his SOR response  any  substantiating
documentation  to  show  that the  debts have  been  resolved  or that his liability  for  repayment
was cancelled in whole or in part.
In  response  to  the  FORM, Applicant provided  an  incomplete  copy  of his  credit  report
obtained  from  Experian  on  July  3, 2020.  It  showed  a  zero balance  on  his mortgage  loan  as
of  August 1, 2017, with  the  following  payment status: “Credit grantor  reclaimed  collateral  to
settle  defaulted   mortgage.”  No  collection   accounts  were  listed   under  the   collections
section. Applicant did not provide  the  section  of  his credit report listing  his open  accounts.
The  account summary  shows that he  has two  open  credit-card accounts with  balances
totaling  $3,354   (credit limits $4,150) and seven  installment loans (likely  his six  student
loans and  the  September 2017  secured  loan) with  balances totaling  $34,911. Eight of  his
accounts had been late at some time. (AE A.)
Applicant presented no details about his income or expenses. There is no evidence
that he has had any financial or budget counseling.
