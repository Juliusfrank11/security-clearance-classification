Applicant  is  47  years  old.  He  is  divorced,  with  three  children.  Applicant  retired
from the Navy in January of 2016 with an honorable discharge. (Item 3 at pages 7, 19,
22~23, and 25~27.)
1.a.  Applicant  admits that he was in  arrears for  his child  support in  the  amount of
about  $23,467.  He  attributes  this  delinquency   to   being   “underemployed”  after  retiring
from   the   Navy.   (Item   7   at  page   5.)  Applicant  is  paying   down   this arrears  with   monthly
payments   of  $666   from   his  retirement   pay,  with   monthly   withholdings  of  $90   from  his
civilian  pay, and  with  any  tax  refunds also being  applied  to  said arrears ($1,200 from  tax
year  2019.)  This  is  supported   by   documentation   provided   by   Applicant.   (Response   at
pages  3~12.)  I  find   that  Applicant  monthly   payments  of   $756,   or  more  than   $9,000
annually,  is a  good-faith  effort  to  address  this, his  largest past-due  debt. This allegation
is found  for Applicant.
1.b.   and   1.c.   Applicant  admits  that  he   owes  two   past-due   to   Creditor  B   totaling
about  $8,407.  He  has   settled   these   debts  for  $4,100,  as  evidenced   by   documentation
submitted   by   Applicant.   (Response   at  pages  13~16.)  These   allegations  are  found   for
Applicant.
1.d. Applicant denies that he owes a  past-due  debt to  Creditor D in the amount of
$1,901.  As the  past-due  amount is noted  as “$0” on  the  government’s most recent July
2020 Credit Report (CR), this allegation is found  for Applicant.  (Item 4 at page 2.)
1.e.    Applicant  denies  that he  owes a  past-due  debt to  Creditor E  in  the  amount
of  $427. As  the  past-due  amount is noted  as  “$0” on  the  government’s most recent  July
2020 Credit Report (CR), this allegation is found  for Applicant.  (Item  4 at page 5.)
