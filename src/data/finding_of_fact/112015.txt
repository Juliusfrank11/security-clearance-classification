Applicant  admitted  SOR ¶¶ 1.a,  2.a,  and 3.a-3.c,  with  explanations,  and denied
SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.c. The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  49  years  old.  She  has  never  married  and  has  one  child.  She  is
seeking  a  position  requiring  a  security  clearance.  She  previously  held  a  security
clearance  before  it  was  revoked  by  another  government  agency  (AGA)  in  2013.  She
currently works as an information technology (IT) systems engineer. She has worked for
her current employer (her clearance sponsor) since June 2018. She holds a bachelor’s
degree. She also owns a fitness business. (Tr. 11-8; 46; GE 5-8)
The  SOR  alleged,  under  Guideline  E,  that  Applicant  committed  employee  theft
between 1989 and 1990 by stealing approximately 25 pieces of clothing (SOR ¶ 1.a). It
also  alleged  that  between  2000  and  2005,  while  employed  by  employer-1  (E1),  and
between 2005 and 2007, while employed by employer-2 (E2), Applicant stole numerous
computer hardware items, including computer towers, monitors, keyboards, mouse sets,
speakers, laptop computers, memory sticks, a hard drive, and a digital scanner (SOR ¶¶
1.b-1.c).  The  employee  theft  of  clothing  was  also  alleged  as  criminal  activity  (SOR  ¶
2.a). Under Guideline M, the SOR alleged that Applicant engaged in illegal downloading
of movies from 1993-2008; music from 2008-2011; and computer software, games, and
emulators (SOR ¶¶ 3.a-3.c).
In  December  2011,  Applicant’s  employer  sponsored  her  for  access  to  AGA’s
sensitive compartmented information (SCI). Applicant held a top secret clearance at that
time. A corresponding background investigation ensued and Applicant was interviewed
and  required  to  take  a  polygraph  examination.  In  March  2012,  during  her  interview,
Applicant admitted that in approximately 1990, she used stolen credit cards to purchase
clothing  items.  The  credit  cards  were  from  a  customer  who  reported  her  purse  stolen
from  the  store  where  Applicant  worked.  A  police  investigation  revealed  Applicant  and
her friend as the crime perpetrators. She was charged with felony theft, but the charges
were  reduced  to  misdemeanors.  She  paid  restitution  and  served  a  work-release
sentence. (Tr. 48; GE 2-5)
Also  during  the  March  2012  interview,  Applicant admitted  that  while  working  for
two  different  employers  (one  was  a  successor  contractor  to  the  other)  from  2000  to
2007 she took, without permission or authorization, numerous computer items, including
multiple  computer  towers,  monitors,  keyboards,  mouse  sets,  speakers,  and  memory
sticks. She also took at least three laptop computers. She used these herself at home
and gave several away to family members, her friends, and even her church. The value
of  the  items  was  in  excess  of  several  thousands  of  dollars.  She  explained  to  the
interviewer that she took the items because she could not afford to buy similar items at
the time and the company was overstocked with these surplus items. She was told by a
government  employee  that  the  items  were  to  be  strictly  accounted  for,  but  he  also
insinuated  that  he  did  not  care  if  she  took  things.  She  knew  what  she  was  doing  was
wrong and she stopped. In her SOR answer and during her testimony, Applicant backed
away from total acceptance of responsibility for her actions and claimed she had verbal
authority from a supervisor to take the items. She also claimed that there was a culture
of permissiveness when it came to computer accountability at these companies during
that  time.  Her  SOR  responses  on  this  issue  and  her  testimony  were  not  credible.  (Tr.
47; GE 5-6, 8)
Applicant  further  related,  during  her  March  2012  interview,  that  she  engaged  in
illegally  downloading  of  music,  movies,  software,  games,  and  emulators  from
approximately  1993  to  2011.  She  estimated  that  she  downloaded  over  10,000  songs
valued  at  over  $10,000  and  over  hundreds  of  movies  valued  at  over  $5,000.  She
engaged  in  this activity  using  her personal computer  equipment and  other  times  using
her  employer’s  computers  and  peripherals.  She  also  illegally  downloaded  software,
game programs, and emulators valued at between $400 and $1,000. Between 2002 and
2007,  she  also  downloaded  music  and  movies  from  a  government  server  without
authorization. In her hearing testimony, Applicant claimed that the permissive culture at
the  government  agency  allowed  the  downloading  from  the  government  server  for
personal use. (Tr. 47; GE 5, 6)
Applicant’s actions described above were fully investigated by AGA and she was
denied  SCI  access  in  December  2012.  Applicant  appealed  that  decision  in  February
2013, and the denial decision was sustained in March 2013. (GE 5-7)
Applicant’s former supervisor from 2006 to 2007 testified that he had no personal
knowledge of Applicant taking company property during that timeframe. He commented
that there was a lack of accountability standards at the company when he took over his
position in 2006. Even though he has not worked with Applicant since that time, he has
stayed  in  contact  with  her  and  is  not  aware  of  any  other  bad  acts  on  her  part.  He
believes that she learned from this incident and has grown because of it. (Tr. 37, 39-41,
43-44)
Applicant  also  presented  written  letters  of  thanks  from  a  former  employer  in
2016, and a certificate of excellence from her employer in 2008. She presented a letter
from  her  supervisor  in  2018  who  fully  described  her  talents  and  skills  within  their
organization.  He  further  described  Applicant  as  a  reliable  and  trustworthy  employee.
Additionally,  Applicant  presented  documentation  showing  her  active  community
involvement by restoring a local residence for cancer patients and her participation in a
local  community  workgroup.  She  is  described  as  an  intelligent,  caring,  and  excellent
team  player.  Applicant  testified  that,  other  than  traffic  tickets,  she  has  not  had  any
further involvement with law enforcement. (Tr. 51; AE A-C, E, H)
