Applicant is a 43-year-old single man. He was previously married from 1995 to 1999.
The marriage ended in divorce. He has an adult child from this relationship. Currently, he is
engaged to his longtime girlfriend.
`
Applicant  earned  a  bachelor’s  of  science  degree  in accounting in 2011, and he
earned a master’s degree in the same field in 2014. (Tr. 17) He has been working as a
consultant for an accounting firm since June 2016. (GE 1 at 11)
In August 2016, Applicant’s girlfriend caught him cheating on her. (Answer at 5)
Applicant had engaged in infidelity, with random strangers whom he met online, 20 to 30
times in the previous 12 months before  his girlfriend discovered it. (Tr. 30) Applicant’s
“feeling of powerlessness to stop [his] behavior drove [him] to attempt” suicide by ingesting
three bottles of prescription medicines. (Answer at 5) Fortunately, Applicant began vomiting
immediately after ingesting the pills, and was admitted into a ten-day inpatient psychiatric
program.  (Answer  at  4)  Upon  discharge,  he  was  diagnosed  with  bipolar  disorder  and
prescribed  various  medications.  Since  then,  Applicant  has  been  attending  therapy
approximately every two weeks and seeing a psychiatrist every two months to monitor his
medication. (GE 2 at 5; Tr. 21)) In addition, he began attending a sexual-addictions support
group  for  his  promiscuous  behavior.  He  attended  the  support  group  meetings  for
approximately 18 months.
Applicant’s  mental-health  condition  is characterized  by  manic behavior.  (Tr. 22)
When Applicant is in a manic state he becomes “overly energetic” and anxious, prompting
him to engage in impulsive behavior in an attempt to calm himself, such as promiscuous,
risky sex with strangers and excessive shopping. (Tr. 22, 30; GE 6 at 4) From 2002 to
2009, Applicant drank alcohol excessively to manage his symptoms. (Tr. 22) Excessive
alcohol consumption is no longer a problem.
Ascertaining the proper balance of medications was challenging. Specifically, if the
daily amount of Applicant’s anti-anxiety prescription was too small, he would continue to
experience anxiety. Conversely, if the prescribed dosage was too high, Applicant would
become depressed. Things “finally clicked” for Applicant with respect to a proper balance of
medication approximately a year and a half ago. (Tr. 41- 42)
Applicant has been taking his medication “religiously, every morning and night.” (Tr.
35) His therapist taught him coping strategies for dealing with his bipolar disorder. He has
not cheated on his girlfriend since the 2016 episode that prompted his suicide attempt, and
he  has  not  engaged  in  any  other  risky,  impulsive  behavior.  Now,  when  Applicant
occasionally experiences manic feelings, he responds by “hyperfocus[ing] on work and
walking his dog. (GE 5 at 1) His work history shows a pattern of stability. (GE 6)
In  September  2018,  Applicant  underwent  a  psychological  evaluation  from  an
independent medical examiner. (GE 6) Per the psychologist, although Applicant “appears
to be on a positive trajectory in terms of remediating what has been a longstanding mental-
health condition,  he still has a medical condition that could negatively impact his judgment,
reliability,  and  trustworthiness  in  the  context  of  safeguarding  sensitive  information  and
working in a cleared setting.”(GE 6 at 6-7) Specifically, Applicant, during his consultation,
demonstrated limited self-awareness and only minimally monitored what he was saying,
leading the psychologist to conclude that “[Applicant’s] talkativeness along with residual
impulsivity led [the psychologist] to believe that a nefarious person could extract sensitive
information from [Applicant] with little effort.” (GE 6 at 6)
Approximately  a  year  after  the  psychological  examination  with  the  independent
medical  examiner,  Applicant’s  treating  therapist  prepared  a  report.    Applicant  began
receiving treatment from her in April 2018 and he continued to consistently attend therapy
sessions through August 19, 2019, when she prepared her report. (GE 5) Per the therapist,
Applicant  still  experienced  manic  episodes;  however,  he  was  engaged  in  the  therapy
sessions, which focused on coping strategies for his manic and depressive symptoms. (GE
5) Her report does not address whether his mental-health disorder could affect his ability to
safeguard sensitive information.
Applicant has approximately $150,000 of delinquent debt. The majority of the debt
consists of delinquent income taxes ($27,730) and delinquent student loans ($119,000).
Applicant’s  financial  problems  began  in  2012  after  relocating  from  State  1  to  State  2.
Applicant was briefly responsible for two lease payments, as his girlfriend remained in their
State 1 residence for approximately a year until their lease expired. Shortly after Applicant
moved to State 2, his  ex-wife, a military member who had physical custody of their then
teenage daughter since the divorce, was deployed abroad, prompting Applicant who had
never previous had physical custody of his daughter more than two weeks per year, now
had to assume physical custody of the daughter during his ex-wife’s deployment. (Tr. 25)
Applicant recognized that continuing to support his girlfriend financially until she relocated
to  his  new  home  in  State  2,  while  at  the  same  time  taking  in  his  daughter  posed  a
tremendous financial burden; however, “in [his] particular manic state, [he] felt like [he]
could do it all.” (Tr. 25)
Overwhelmed, Applicant increased his income tax withholdings to generate more
take-home income. (Tr. 73) By 2017, he owed $15,800 in delinquent federal income taxes
from tax years 2012 through 2016, as alleged in SOR subparagraph 2.a, and he owed
approximately $14,000 in delinquent state income taxes. (Answer at 1) In 2017, Applicant
began satisfying his federal income-tax debt through a payment plan, under which he paid
the IRS $220 per month. (Tr. 79) Applicant has missed half of the scheduled payments,
and he has not made a payment in the past six months. (Tr. 80, 82) Recently, the IRS
applied a $2,000 refund from Applicant’s 2019 income tax return to the delinquency. (Tr.
27) The current debt totals $13,575. (AE A)
Applicant owes approximately $14,155 in delinquent state income taxes, as alleged
in SOR subparagraph 2.b. When he researched the delinquency, he realized that he had
not filed his tax returns for 2012 and 2014. After he filed these returns, the tax burden was
reduced to $7,140, as the refunds were applied to the delinquency. (Tr. 27; AE B) He then
set up a payment plan. He has not made any payments in more than a year. (Tr. 83-84)
The  debts  alleged  in  SOR  subparagraphs  2.c,  2.e,  2.f,  and  2.i  through  2.m  are
delinquent credit-card accounts, totaling approximately $6,200. Applicant has made no
payments  and  they  remain  outstanding.  (Tr.  88-89)  These  bills  became  delinquent  in
September  2017  after  Applicant  “drew  the  line”  and  concluded  that  he  could  not
simultaneously pay for mental-health treatment and meet his debt payments. (Tr. 97)
SOR subparagraph 2.d, totaling $2,275, is owed to a company that publishes study
materials for accountants. (Tr. 86; GE 1 at 13) Applicant disputes this bill, contending that
his then employer was supposed to have satisfied it. (Tr. 86) He provided no evidence in
support of this contention.
The debts alleged in SOR subparagraphs 2.g and 2.h are student-loan accounts.
They  total  approximately  $119,000.  In  April  2019,  Applicant  entered  a  rehabilitation
agreement to satisfy the loans. Under the plan, he was to pay $345 monthly for a ten-
month probationary period. (Tr. 90) If Applicant were to conform to the agreement, the
creditor would no longer consider the loan to be in delinquent status. (Tr. 90) Applicant
made  payments  for  the  first  three  months,  as  agreed,  but  he  missed  the  payment  for
August 2019. He provided evidence of a September 2019 payment, but he did not provide
any proof that he made the payments for October through December of 2019.
Applicant  earns  $114,000  per  year.  (Tr.  65)  He  has  $3,000  invested  in  a  401k
account. (Tr. 72) He has not attended any credit counseling. (Tr. 90) There is no record
evidence that he maintains a budget.
