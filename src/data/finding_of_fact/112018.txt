Applicant  is  a  50-year-old  employee  of  a  DoD  contractor  seeking  to  maintain  a
security clearance. He has worked for his  current employer since 2015. Applicant also
has his own company, but he stopped running the business in 2016. Prior to his current
job,  he  worked  for  private  industry,  government  contractors,  and  as  a  federal
government civilian employee. He has held a security clearance on and off since 1986.
The  highest  level  of  education  Applicant  has  achieved  is  a  doctorate  degree.  He  is  a
graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy. He served on active duty for over four years. He
was medically discharged and received an honorable discharge.  He is married and has
three adult children. (Tr.67-74, 123; Gov 1)
On July 17, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. (Gov 1) A
subsequent  security  clearance  background  investigation  resulted  in  the  following  SOR
allegations:  Applicant  failed  to  file  his  Federal  and  State  income  returns  for  tax  years
2011,  2012,  2013,  2014,  and  2015.    (SOR  ¶  1.a:  Gov  1  at  60-65);  a  delinquent
mortgage  account  was  past  due  in  the  amount  of  $38,371  with  a  total  approximate
balance  of  $391,536.  (SOR  ¶  1.b:  Gov  1  at  67-69;  Gov  2  at  2;  Gov  3  at  5);  a
homeowners  association  filed  a  warrant  in  debt  against  Applicant  on  January  2018
(SOR  ¶  1.c:  Gov  4  at  1-2);  a  $13,907  delinquent  account  with  a  bank  was  placed  for
collection  (SOR  ¶  1.d:  Gov  2 at 2;  Gov  3  at  2);  and  a $7,263  credit-card  account  was
charged off. (SOR ¶ 1.e: Gov 2 at 2; Gov 3 at 2).
Additional allegations include:  a charged-off account with a bank in the amount
of $4,668 (SOR ¶ 1.f: Gov 2 at 2; Gov 4 at 3-4); an account with a timeshare owner’s
association in the amount of $1,268 that was placed for collection. (SOR  ¶ 1.g:  Gov 2
at  10);  and  a  $134  delinquent  medical  account  that  was  placed  for  collection.(SOR  ¶
1.h: Gov 2 at 10).
Failure to File State and Federal Income Tax Returns
Applicant admits he failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for tax
years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. He failed to file his income tax returns
initially  because  he  moved  in  2009  to  a  new  area  and  immediately  was  assigned
overseas  for  five  months.  When  he  returned  in  May  2010,  he  was  late  filing  his  tax
returns,  and  he  could  not  find  his  documentation  because  it  was  located  in  storage.
Applicant admits he procrastinated filing his state and federal tax returns over the next
five years. He believed that he was to receive refunds and did not think it was important
to  file  his  state  and  federal  tax  returns.  At  the  urging  of  his  friends,  Applicant  hired  a
CPA in 2016. His state and federal tax returns for tax years 2010  – 2015 were filed in
June 2016. Applicant received refunds on his tax returns. There is no indication in the
record  whether  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  assessed  a  penalty  regarding  the  late
filing of the returns. (Tr. 79-84; Answer to SOR; AE H – M)
In  the  middle  of  2017,  Applicant  was  contacted  by  the  state  department  of
taxation regarding his failure to file back taxes. The state apparently lost the tax returns
so  Applicant  re-submitted  his  state  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2010  –  2015  in  April  23,
2018.  In  a  letter  dated  August  31,  2018,  the  state  department  of  taxation  indicated
Applicant owed $464.59. On January 10, 2019, the state department of taxation issued
Applicant a refund on $111.40 for tax year 2015. (Tr. 86-89, 91-92; AE P; AE Q)
During the hearing, Applicant testified that he had not filed his state and federal
tax  returns  for  tax  years  2016  and  2017.  Applicant  testified  that  his  failure  to  file  his
state  and  federal  tax  returns  for  2016  and  2017  was  his  responsibility.  He  was  still
gathering documentation to give to his accountant to file the returns. (Tr. 89-90, 93)
During  the  hearing,  Department  Counsel  moved  to  amend  to  the  SOR  to  be  in
conformity  with  the  evidence  in  accordance  with  Directive,  paragraph  E3.1.17.  The
motion was granted, but the record was held open for an additional two weeks to allow
Applicant  additional  time  to  provide  additional  documents  regarding  the  status  of  his
2016 and 2017 federal and state tax returns. (Tr. 132-136) After the hearing, Applicant
timely provided an Internal Revenue Service (IRS Form 4868), Application for Automatic
Extension  of  Time  to  File  U.S.  Individual  Income  Tax  Return  for  tax  year  2017.  The
extension  gave  Applicant  six  more  months  to  file  his  2017  income  tax  return,  which
would have been due October 15, 2018. At the close of the record, there was no proof
that Applicant filed his state and federal income tax returns for 2016 and 2017. (AE R;
AE S)
Other Financial Issues
In 2005, Applicant and his wife built a house which ended up costing more than
they  had  anticipated.  In  order  to  pay  for  some  special  upgrades  during  the  home
construction, Applicant charged a lot on his credit cards. As the sole breadwinner of the
family, Applicant had difficulty making the mortgage payments.  In May 2008, Applicant
resigned his position as a U.S. contractor and accepted a position as a GS-15 with the
federal government. His new job was located in another city several hours from where
he  resided.  He  commuted  to  his  new  job  location  during  the  week  and  would  return
home on the weekends. (Tr. 94-99; Answer to SOR)
In June 2008, Applicant put the house on the market in the midst of the housing
crisis. The mortgage on the house was more than the value of the house. He rented the
house for a few  years, but often the rent did not cover the mortgage.  He had difficulty
making payments and got behind on his other finances. (Tr. 94-100; Answer to SOR)
In 2017, Applicant changed jobs and began working as a government contractor,
hoping that it would increase his income. He continued to fall behind on his expenses.
He refused to give up on his debts. Towards the end of 2017, the contract that he was
working  on  was  not  renewed.  He  lost  billable  hours  resulting  in  his  financial  situation
becoming more unstable. He was only able to find a contract job which paid one third of
his previous income. (Answer to SOR)
In January 2017, Applicant stopped making mortgage payments. He attempted to
obtain  a  short  sale  the  property  or  a  deed  in  lieu  of  foreclosure.  His  efforts  were
unsuccessful. The home was foreclosed in October 2017. (Tr. 95-103; Answer to SOR)
After  many  years  of  trying  to  keep  his  mortgage  and  maintain  his  finances,
Applicant contacted a debt-relief agency to help him negotiate his delinquent accounts.
Applicant signed an agreement with the debt-relief agency on March 20, 2018. He pays
the debt-relief agency $1,500 a month, which the debt-relief agency uses to enter into
settlement  agreements  and  pay  off  debts.  His  anticipated  debt-free  target  is  March
2022. (Tr. 105-106; Answer to SOR; AE C – AE G).
The accounts in the plan with the debt-relief agency include the debts alleged in
SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g. In addition, there were several debts that are not alleged in
the  SOR.  The  debts  include  a  $47,800  debt  owed  to  a  bank,  which  is  the  second
mortgage  on  the  home  that  went  to  foreclosure;  a  $20,800  debt  owed  to  a  bank;  a
$20,543  debt  owed  to  a  credit  union,  and  a  $5,278  debt  owed  to  a  financial  services
company. (Tr. 103-106; AE D; AE E; AE F; AE G: AE N)  In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at
4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct
not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:
(a)  to  assess  an  applicant’s  credibility;  (b)  to  evaluate  an  applicant’s
evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to
consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;
(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines
is  applicable;  or  (e)  to  provide  evidence  for whole-person  analysis  under
Directive Section 6.3.
(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633
at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). I have considered the non-SOR derogatory information
accordingly.
The status of the SOR debts is:
SOR ¶ 1.a: - Failure to file state and federal income tax returns for 2010, 2011,
2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 - During the hearing, SOR ¶ 1.a was amended to add tax
years 2016 and 2017. The state and federal tax returns for 2010 to 2015 were filed in
June 2016. He resubmitted the state tax returns for tax years 2010 to 2015 in 2018. It
appears  he  received  refunds  for  each  year.  No  documentation  was  provided  from  the
Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  discussing  the  status  of  his  tax  situation,  such  as  if
penalties were imposed as a result of the late filing of his tax returns. At the close of the
record, the state and federal tax returns for tax years 2016 and 2017 remain unfiled.
SOR ¶ 1.b: - Mortgage past due in the amount of $38,371, with a total balance of
$391,536  -  The  home  was  foreclosed  in  2017.  Applicant  stopped  making  mortgage
payments  in  January  2017.  He  is  not  aware  whether  he  owes  a  deficiency  after  the
mortgage  foreclosure.  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  provided  a  copy  of  an  IRS  form
1099-A,  Acquisition  of  Abandonment  of  Secured  Property.    It  states  the  foreclosure
occurred on November 14, 2017.  The fair market value of the property was $421,104.
The  balance  on  the  principle  mortgage  was  $391,535.  It  appears  there  was  no
deficiency regarding the primary mortgage.  (Tr. 94-103; Answer to SOR, attach 1.b)
SOR  ¶  1.c:  -  Warrant  in  debt  filed  against  Applicant  by  a  homeowner’s
association  -  On  February  27,  2018,  an  attorney  collecting  on  behalf  of  the

SOR ¶ 1.d: - $13,907 debt placed for collection - Applicant believes this is either
a credit-card debt or a debt owed to a timeshare. In April 2018, the debt-relief agency
negotiated a settlement for Applicant in the amount of $6,258.27. Payments towards the

SOR  ¶  1.f:  -  $4,668  charged-off  account:  Agency  negotiated  this  debt  -  He
agreed  to  pay  $2,000  by  December  2017.  The  remaining  balance  of  $2,668  was
discharged  by  the  creditor  in  tax  year  2017.  In  his  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant
provided  a  copy  of  the  1099-C,  Cancellation  of  Debt,  from  the  creditor.  The  $2,668
amount was discharged. The account is resolved. However, Applicant may have some
tax  implications  as  a  result  of  the  cancellation  of  debt.  (Tr.  114;  Answer  to  SOR,
attachment 1.f)
SOR  ¶  1.g:  -  $1,268  collection  account  for  fees  owed  to  a  timeshare  -  This
account is being negotiated by his debt-relief agency. On April 9, 2018, an agreement
was  reached  to  settle  this  account.  The  balance  was  $5,479.  Applicant  agreed  to  pay
$2,188.51  and  to  sign  a  deed  in  lieu  of  foreclosure.  He  agreed  to  pay  $211  a  month
from  May  2018  to  February  2019  to  settle  the  account.  He  provided  proof  payments
were made from May 2018 to December 2018. (Tr. 115-116; Answer to SOR; AE B; AE
N; AE O)
SOR  ¶  1.h:  -  $134  medical  collection  account  -  Applicant  disputes  this  debt
because he does not recognize the account. (Tr. 116)
Applicant  owned  three  timeshares.  The  first  timeshare  was  purchased  in  1994.
He  owned  this  timeshare,  but  was  still  responsible  for  fees.  He  purchased  a  second
timeshare  a  few  years  later.  He  purchased  a  third  timeshare  in  2009,  after  his  family
moved to his new work location. He wanted a place for his wife and children to go to the
pool  during  the  summer.  Applicant  could  not  pay  his  annual  fees  for  all  three
timeshares.  He  is  negotiating  settlements  with  them  in  his  debt-relief  plan.  (Tr.  117-
120)
Applicant has not sought the advice of a financial planner or credit counselor. He
has not used a credit card in over a year. He testified that he has no open credit-card
accounts. He has not incurred new debt within 16 months prior to the hearing. He does
not  know  the  amount  of  his  current  monthly  income.  In  addition  to  his  salary,  he
receives  a  $1,300  monthly  payment  from  the  Veteran’s  Administration  for  his  medical
retirement and disability. He does not know what his monthly expenses are. He claims
he  is  able  to  pay  his debts  and  has  a  little  income  left  over  each  month.  He  does  not
have a 401(k). (Tr. 121-129)
Whole-Person Evidence
Dr.  J.,  Applicant’s  friend  and  business  partner,  testified  during  the  hearing.  He
has known Applicant since 2004. Their business contracts with private and government
organizations  for  training.  They  both  studied  for  their  doctoral  programs  at  the  same
time. Around 2015, Dr. J. invited Applicant to come work  for him as a contractor. They
have been business partners since 2015. There was a period around 2016 where some
of their contracts ended and there was no money coming into the business. (Tr. 28-37)
Dr. J. is aware of Applicant’s tax and financial issues.  In October 2018 or 2019,
he  was  contacted  by  the  IRS  and  told  to  change  Applicant’s  tax  withholdings  to  zero
exemptions. He testified that Applicant is not good at paper work, which is the cause of
Applicant’s  problems.  Aside  from  these  issues,  Applicant’s  character  is  beyond
reproach.  His  reliability  and  ethics  are  good.  Dr.  J.  has  no  concerns  with  Applicant
having a security clearance. (Tr. 40-43)
Dr.  J.  is  in  charge  of  the  S  corporation.  The  corporation  has  four  full-time
employees  and  two  part-time  employees.  They  all  work  on  different  contracts.  He
estimates  Applicant’s  annual  income  was  approximately  $175,000  annually  in  a  good
year when Applicant worked a full schedule. Applicant’s income was less in years where
they did not have as many contracts. There was not much business in 2016 and 2017,
so  Applicant  earned  less  income.  In  2017,  Applicant  changed  to  being  a  salaried
employee. His annual income is around $143,000. (Tr. 46-49, 56)
Applicant  told  Dr.  J.  about  his  financial  issues  in  2015.  Dr.  J.  does  all  of  the
bookkeeping,  so  he  is  not  concerned  about  Applicant’s  financial  situation.  He  wants
Applicant  to  resolve  his  tax  situation  before  he  is  listed  as  a  company  officer.  (Tr.  50-
51.)
