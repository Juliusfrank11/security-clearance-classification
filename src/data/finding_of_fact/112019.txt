Applicant is 41 years old, a high school graduate with some college credits. He is
married with three children, two daughters ages eight and three, and a son age five. Since
February 2006, Applicant has been employed by defense contractors. (Tr. 21, 31-33; GE
1.)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  has  10  delinquent  accounts  totaling  $20,901.
(SOR  ¶  1.)  Applicant  admitted  all  of  those  accounts.  (Answer  ¶  1.)  Applicant  testified
about the status of the SOR delinquent debts. SOR ¶ 1.a is Applicant’s home mortgage.
Applicant testified that he brought the mortgage current 6 to 12 months ago. That debt,
however,  was  reported  delinquent  as of  March  15,  2018.  (Tr. 57-59; GE 4.) The other
nine delinquent debts are charge-offs (4), collections (4), and one judgment. (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-
f & h; SOR ¶¶ 1.b, g-h & j; SOR ¶ 1.i.) The virtually uniform descriptions of the current
status of the delinquent SOR debts are: (1) they went delinquent between 2012 and 2014;
(2) Applicant  plans to pay  those  debts  by  payment  plan or otherwise;  (3) there are no
payment plans in effect; and (4) Applicant has made no payments on those debts. (Tr.
57-80.)
Applicant testified about the circumstances that caused his financial problems. Not
long  after  Applicant’s  oldest  daughter  was  born,  she  showed  signs  of  developmental
delay. Applicant took her to a number of specialists and neurologists. At age 4, she was
diagnosed to be fully on the far end of the autism spectrum. She is non-verbal with erratic
behavior. She is currently enrolled in a special needs program. (Tr. 21-22.)
When  Applicant’s  daughter  was  evaluated  for  a  school-based  special  needs
program,  Applicant  was  told  that  she  would  not  qualify  for  a  high  school  diploma  and
would need to go through a certificate program instead. Because Applicant believed his
daughter was smart and capable, Applicant objected to that finding and hired a lawyer to
challenge it. That was not an expense Applicant had anticipated before her birth (about
$2,500  to  $3,000).  The  challenge  was  successful,  and  Applicant’s  daughter  was
recommended for a very expensive form of in-home therapy, involving four to five days
per week of therapist visits. The insurance that Applicant has through his employer does
not cover that therapy. As a result, Applicant had to go to the outside insurance market
for  insurance  that  would  cover  that  therapy.  He  was  successful,  but  the  insurance  he
obtained  has  very  high  deductibles.  He  estimated  that  her  specialized  coverage  costs
more than $500 per month. Applicant’s daughter needs constant attention and now has
a full-time therapist. (Tr. 23-24, 27-28, 50-52, 87.)
As  a  result  of  the  costs  of  his  daughter’s  in-home  therapy,  Applicant  had  to
prioritize his mortgage, taxes, and utilities to keep a roof over his family’s head and to
make sure his other two children were being taken care of. His credit card bills, however,
were not being paid on time. To keep himself gainfully employed, Applicant took out-of-
state and out-of-country work assignments. (Tr. 23-25.)
Applicant also suffered loss of household income when his spouse took time off
after the birth of her three children. The oldest daughter was born in April 2011, and her
mother took about 12 to 18 months off after her birth. At the time, Applicant’s spouse was
making about $80,000 per year. Although she applied for unemployment compensation,
the household income suffered a significant loss until Applicant’s spouse went back to
work at the $80,000 per year range. Applicant’s son was born in May 2014. Applicant’s
spouse took about three to six months off, and at the time, she had been making about
$100,000  per  year.  Applicant’s  younger  daughter  was  born  in  September  2016.
Applicant’s wife took three to six months off, and at the time she was making just over
$100,000  per  year.  When  Applicant’s  wife  rejoined  the  workforce,  she  made  about
$70,000 per year, which is her current salary. She took a pay cut in order to work from
home to get the children to school, be home when they return, and be home when her
oldest daughter’s therapist is there. In sum, Applicant’s household income decreased by
about $80,000 when his oldest daughter was born, about $50,000 when his son was born,
and about $50,000 when his youngest daughter was born. (Tr. 41-49.)
Applicant testified about his household finances. Currently, he and his spouse earn
$80,000 and $70,000 per year, respectively. They have no other sources of income. They
have  no  car  loans  and  no  savings  account.  Applicant’s  401(k)  has  about  a  $15,000
balance.  The  only  real  estate  they  own  is  the  family  home.  In  2009,  when  it  was
purchased,  the  sale  price  was  $390,000.  Applicant  is  current  on  his  state  and  federal
income taxes. He has never owed any taxes and always gets a refund. He has never filed
for bankruptcy. Applicant has not taken any financial counseling courses. (Tr. 37-40, 53,
55, 81-82, 91-92.)
Applicant’s mortgage payment is $2,500 per month. Groceries are about $800 per
month.  Utilities  are  $250  per  month.  Cable  and  cellphones  are  $300  per  month.  Car
insurance  and  gas  are  $650  per month.  Specialized  insurance  coverage  is  more  than
$500 per month. Employer-sponsored health insurance is $400 per month. That yields a
net remainder of $7,125 per month. Applicant sets aside some of that remainder to pay
some  of  the  smaller  debts.  His  plan  is  to  get  current  on  the  mortgage  and  day-to-day
expenses to improve his credit score, so he can take out a home equity loan to pay off all
outstanding bills.   (Tr. 27, 82-99.)
