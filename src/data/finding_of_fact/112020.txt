Applicant is a 32-year-old cable technician who has performed the same type of
work with the same entity since April 2016. Married in 2018, Applicant and his wife have
a toddler and a preteen child. They bought their home in 2016.
Applicant completed high school and  briefly attended some college. During high
school, starting in about March 2003, Applicant began using marijuana infrequently as a
“social  thing.”  (Tr.  87).  He  continued  using  the  drug  infrequently  in  college,  where  he
played football and was subject to drug testing, but he never tested positive for an illegal
drug. Subsequent drug use was intermittent. In January 2016, living in a new home with
his  new  bride  and  a  baby  on  the  way,  he  was  ready  to  face  adult  responsibilities.  He
decided to quit using marijuana on New Year’s Day. He has no interest in returning to
drug use and he has signed a statement of intent not to again use drugs under penalty
of  loss  of  an  clearance  granted.  (Ex.  C)  Since  that  time,  he  has  been  subject  to  drug
testing, but never been flagged for drugs. He is committed to remaining marijuana-free.
Over  the  past  dozen  years,  Applicant  has  experienced  two  periods  of
unemployment – a two-month period from late October 2014 to December 2014 and a
five-month  period  from  June  2009  to  November  2009.  He  was  also  unemployed  for
about three months after leaving college in 2007. He has not had financial counseling.
Applicant failed to timely file federal and state tax returns for tax year (TY) 2007.
At  that  time,  he  was  19,  a  dependent  of  his  mother,  a  full-time  student,  and  any
“income”  at  issue  was  paid  to  Applicant  by  his  mother.  (Tr.  17-18)  Consequently,  he
was not required to file tax returns for that year. (Tr. 18)
For  TY  2012,  based  on  “some  bad  advice,”  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his
federal tax returns. (Tr. 19) At the time, he owed approximately $1,847 for TY 2012. He
had his tax returns for TY 2012 done on his behalf in June 2014, but the amount owed
went  unpaid.  (Tr.  19)  At  the  same  time,  his  federal  tax  returns  for  TY  2013  were
belatedly filed, but a balance of $7,372 was not paid. (Tr. 20) They had not initially been
filed on time because of “bad advice” he had received. (Tr. 20)
In 2017, Applicant used a professional tax preparer and had his TY 2014 federal
tax  returns  filed.  (Tr.  20)  He  made  no  payments  toward  taxes  owed  because  he  was
given  poor  advice  and  because  he  was  afraid  he  could  not  afford  to  satisfy  the  total
sums owed during a year in which he had endured a significant period of unemployment
followed by a [period of reduced income. (Tr. 21) He had been advised that there was
no  urgency  in  filing  late  returns.  (Tr.  23)  Moreover,  he  had  never  set  money  aside  for
bonuses  on  which  taxes  had  not  been  withheld.  (Tr.  22)  He  had  no  savings  account,
preferring  to  put  any  saved  money  into  his  retirement  account.  He  “didn’t  have  a
complete understanding” of the tax process and what had to be filed by April 15. (Tr. 21)
When the tax professional filled in missing tax returns, he told Applicant “late fees were
waived, and things of that sort,” but failed to stress the urgency of paying the amounts
due. (Tr. 23)
Today,  all  federal  tax  returns  have  been  filed.  Regarding  TY  2015,  Applicant
belatedly filed for that year in October 2017, but the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was
unable  to  verify  that  it  had  been  filed  after a  request  for  proof  of  filing  was  initiated  in
2018. (Ex. D; Tr. 24) Due to an internal issue and past identity theft, the IRS is unable to
identify Applicant, making him go through a multi-step verification process. (Ex. E) He is
now in a repayment plan where he pays $100 each month to satisfy any outstanding tax
balance. (Ex. G) His overall tax balance is substantially reduced. (Tr. 29)
Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  state  tax  returns  and  pay  owed  taxes  for TY  2012
through 2016. In addition, tax liens were entered against Applicant in 2015 ($3,474) and
in 2017 ($1,561). Again, Applicant had been given poor tax advice and an initial person
helping  him  was  less  than  thorough.  Applicant  has  since  filed  state  tax  returns  for TY
2012  through  2016.  As  per  state  rules  dictating  tax  repayment,  he  is  in  a  repayment
plan  under  which  he  timely  pays  $146.05  per  month  to  satisfy  his  entire  state  tax
balance, which was last noted as a balance of $3,685.54.(see Ex. I; Applicant’s e-mail
narrative of Oct. 17, 2018, at 2-3)
Also at issue are seven delinquent debts:
ADVERSE  JUDGMENT  -  $6,201  –  DISPUTED  -  Dating  from  2016,  the
delinquent debt is related to a rental property in which Applicant resided with his mother.
Applicant has been unable to locate the creditor for his mother. He disputes the balance
cited. (Tr. 54-56, 74)
US  DEPT.  OF  EDUCATION  COLLECTIONS  -  $2,269/$1,508/$1,455  –  IN
REPAYMENT  as  of  2016  after  completion  of  a  rehabilitation  program.  His  balance  is
notably reduced and he is in good standing under the repayment plan. (Ex. A; Ex. D; Tr.
57-61)
STATE  COLLECTION  -  $1,867  –  UNRESOLVED  –  Applicant  is  looking  in  to
setting up some form of repayment plan.
BANK COLLECTION - $1,133 – IN REPAYMENT – This debt is now at $500 or
less through timely repayments. (Ex. A; Tr. 69-72)
GYM COLLECTION - $115 – PAID on or before February 2017. (Ex. B)
In around October 2014, Applicant and other employees were terminated from a
telecommunications  entity  for  falsifying  records.  At  the  time,  Applicant  worked  two
overlapping shifts amounting to 232 hours during each two-week pay period. (Tr. 77-78,
80)  On-call  services  were  regularly  performed  before  his  usual  regular  shift  began
because  he  would  often  cover  for  other  employees.  For  example,  he  might  begin
performing  on-call  services  at  7  a.m.  before  starting  his  nine-hour  11  a.m.  to  8  p.m.
shift. (Tr. 77-78) In doing so, he would log in for work at 7 a.m., thus reflecting a longer
than expected work day consisting of what could be viewed as two nine-hour shifts. (Tr.
78) In addition, he was to be available on-call 24-hours a day as needed. (Tr. 80) During
those periods, he was the only employee receiving on-call assignments. (Tr. 81)
Although  all  the  work  Applicant  reported  as  completed  was  performed,
management claimed it tracked insufficient movement of his truck. This was an internal
earmark for activity even though some calls could be monitored from the central office
(e.g.,  problems  related  to  power  outages  beyond  his  company’s  control)  without  an
actual  trip  to  the  problem  site.  (Tr.  82-83)  Applicant  and  other  techs  were  put  on
administrative  leave  for  such  perceived  deficiencies,  during  which  time  Applicant
objected.  Ultimately,  they  were  terminated  for  falsification  of  documents.  (Tr.  85)
Despite this consequence, there was no written guidance advising against  this practice
or dictating another protocol. (Tr. 85) Indeed, there had been an agreement noting that
employees could not be fired for anything related with the GPS system. (Tr. 86)
