SOR ¶ 1.n is a debt owed to a cell phone provider for $640. Applicant testified that
she recognized this debt. She contacted the provider in about July 2016 and learned that

explained that for all the SOR debts she denied, she was trying to clean up her credit
report  in  connection  with  buying  her  house  in  August  2018.  Applicant  went  on  Credit
Karma and clicked the “Dispute” selection for the denied debts. She never heard anything
back  from  Credit  Karma.  Applicant  has  no  written  documentation  that  confirms  those
debts are disputed. (Tr. 20, 57-58.)

using her credit card. Applicant recalled that there was some damage to the car that her
friend failed to pay. The rental was paid but not for the damage. Applicant testified that it
happened when she was very young, over 10 years ago. The debt was written off, but
she  does  not  know  when.  Applicant  is  currently  able  to  rent  from  the  same  car  rental
company. (Tr. 58-61.)
SOR ¶ 1.r is a medical debt for $129. Applicant has two accounts with this medical
insurer. She is not sure which account this debt is for. Applicant disputed this debt on
Credit Karma in about April or June 2018. (Tr. 61-62.) (This was not alleged as a medical
debt in the SOR.  Based on Applicant’s testimony, it is such a debt.)
Applicant  testified  about  her personal finances.  She has not  taken  any financial
counseling. Applicant’s full-time employment with the defense contractor pays $50,000
per year. She also has a business on the side doing children’s parties and other child
entertainment  events.  That  averages  about  $1,500  per  month.  Those  incomes  yield
$5,667 take-home pay per month. (Tr. 24-25, 62-63.)
Applicant’s mortgage is $2,800 per month. She receives $528 per month in child
assistance.  Her  brother  pays  for  her  children’s  clothes.  Applicant’s  gas,  utilities,  auto
insurance, and miscellaneous expenses come to about $785 per month. She has no car
payments. Applicant owns two cars, but both are paid off. Her monthly remainder is about
$1,100 per month. Of that remainder, Applicant puts $500 per month in the bank so she
“does not see it.” The remaining $1,000 Applicant uses to pay bills. She has about $1,500
in savings and about $3,500 in her retirement account. (Tr.27, 29-30, 62-69.)
Applicant’s deceased partner made $75,000 per year as an electrical contractor.
When he died, she lost 60% of the household income. If she needs financial help, her
father, brother, an aunt, and an uncle can be counted on to assist her. Applicant has had
gaps  in  her  employment  history  due  to  a  workplace  injury  that  put  her  on  workers’
compensation. She still suffers from residual effects of that injury. Applicant also had gaps
in employment due to pregnancies. (Tr. 19, 29-30; GE 1, pp. 12-19; GE 2, pp. 3-5.)
