Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct
When Applicant submitted her December 24, 2014 SCA, she disclosed that she
owed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS): about $30,000 for tax year 2008; about $10,000
for tax year 2010; about $11,000 for tax year 2011; about $5,000 for tax year 2012; and
about $5,000 for tax year 2013. (GE 1) She said she was “working on putting a payment
plan in place.” (GE 1)
During Applicant’s July 11, 2016 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal
subject interview (PSI), Applicant said she paid the IRS $1,000 monthly and paid her tax
debts as follows: for tax years 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2012  she paid the taxes around
2015; and for tax year 2013, she plans to pay this debt in August 2016. (GE 6 at 10-11)
She plans to complete payments on her $50,000 federal tax lien by August 2016. (GE 6
at  11)  These  statements  about  resolution  of  her  federal  income  tax  debts  were  not

The SOR alleges the following financial allegations:
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.j allege Applicant failed to timely file her federal and state income
tax returns for tax years 2007 through 2016 under Guideline F. SOR ¶ 2.a cross-alleges
the same allegations under Guideline E.
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant owes the IRS $2,690 for tax year 2007. On February
26, 2018, Applicant paid the IRS $2,693, and on March 19, 2018, Applicant paid the IRS
$26. (AE 14 at 1-2) In 2018, she paid her IRS debt for tax year 2007. (AE. 4)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant owes the IRS $24,642 for tax year 2008. On February
26, 2018, Applicant paid the IRS $24,517. (AE 14 at 3) In 2018, she paid her IRS debt for
tax year 2008. (AE 5)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges Applicant owes the IRS $25,524 for tax year 2009. On February
27, 2018, Applicant paid the IRS $3,870, and on March 2, 2018, she paid $26,500. (AE
14 at 4-6) In 2018, she paid the IRS debt for tax year 2009. (AE 6)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant failed to timely pay, as required, the IRS for tax year
2010.  Her  2010  IRS  tax  transcript  shows  her  tax  per  return  was  $1,221,  and  her
withholding was $7,619. (AE 7) On April 15, 2011, $6,772 was transferred from her IRS
account for tax year 2010  to pay her taxes for tax  year 2008. (AE 7)  On February 27,
2018,  she  paid  the  IRS  $4,294.  (AE  14  at  7)  Her  IRS  tax  transcript  for  tax  year  2010
shows a zero balance owed. (AE 7) It is unclear why additional taxes were paid in 2018.
The SOR does not allege a failure to timely pay federal income taxes for tax years
2011 and 2012. On February 28, 2018, Applicant paid the IRS $7,063 for tax year 2011.
(AE 14 at 8) On February 28, 2018, she paid the IRS $7,760 for tax year 2012, and on
March 20, 2018, she paid the IRS $75 for tax year 2012. (AE 14 at 9-10) She paid her
IRS debts for tax years 2011 and 2012. (AE 8, 9)
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  Applicant  owes  the  IRS  $5,085  for  tax  year  2013.  When
Applicant filed her tax return, she owed $12,873, and she had previously paid $9,620.
(AE 10) She made three payments to the IRS in 2018 as follows: $7,153 (March 2, 2018);
$1,200  (March  8,  2018);  and  $4,050  (March  8,  2018).  (AE  14  at  11-13)  Her  IRS  tax
transcript shows a zero balance owed for tax year 2013. (AE 10)
SOR  ¶  1.g  alleges  Applicant  owes  the  IRS  $91,087  for  tax  year  2015.  When
Applicant filed her tax return, she owed $12,873, and she had previously paid $9,620.
(AE 10) On March 1, 2018, she paid $90,950, and her IRS tax transcript shows a zero
balance  owed  for  tax  year  2015.  (AE  10;  AE  14  at  14)  It  is  unclear  why  her  taxes
significantly increased after she filed her tax return.
SOR  ¶  1.h  alleges  Applicant  owes  the  IRS  $22,291  for  tax  year  2016.  When
Applicant filed her tax return, she owed $92,258, and she had previously paid $27,380.
(AE 13) Applicant made the following significant payments in 2018: $15,179 (March 19,
2018);  $20,000  (April  23,  2019);  $10,000  (August  23,  2018);  $10,000  (September  17,
2018); and $4,987 (November 17, 2018). (AE 13, AE 14 at 15-20) Her tax debt was also
reduced due to transfers of overpayments for tax years 2008, 2012, and 2013. (AE 13)
Applicant’s IRS tax transcript indicates she has a zero balance for tax year 2016, and two
refunds  totaling  $2,204  were  transferred  to  non-IRS  debts.  (AE  13)  The  transfers  to
address non-IRS debts are an indication that as of November 2018 all IRS debts were
paid. (AE 13)
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges the IRS filed a tax lien for $50,875 against Applicant in about
October 2013. SOR ¶ 1.k alleges a state tax authority filed a tax lien for $8,854 against
Applicant, and SOR ¶ 1.l alleges Applicant owes a state tax authority $17,705. On March
4, 2019, the state tax authority indicated Applicant owed $12,390; the monthly installment
amount is $710; and the first monthly payment is due on March 15, 2019. (AE 16) On
October 28, 2019, the state tax authority wrote the balance due is $40,455. (AE 17D) A
payment plan requiring monthly payments of $1,300 for 36 months was established with
the first payment due on November 15, 2019. (AE 17D)
According  to  Applicant’s  IRS  tax  transcripts,  Applicant  had  an  adjusted  gross
income (AGI) of more than $300,000 in four of ten of the tax years from 2007 to 2016.
(AE 4-13) For tax year 2007, she said she was sued by another company based on an
allegation  of  non-compete,  and  “trying  to  defend  that  ate  up  most  of”  her  $1,110,000
income  in  2007.  (Tr.  24)  Her  taxable  income  for  2007  was  $1,058,000.  (AE  4)  She
explained that she could not utilize all of the funds indicated in her AGI on her federal
income tax returns because she used the funds to make payroll, and she does not have
a line of credit. (Tr. 23) She did not provide documentation showing the funds spent for
litigation  or  payroll.  For  tax  years  2010,  2011,  and  2012,  she  had  negative  income
because she was starting a new company. (Tr. 29) Applicant’s current budget indicates
she has sufficient income to pay her tax debts. (AE 17A)
Applicant described her tax issues as an anomalous period in her life that she has
resolved, except for the two payment plans with the IRS and state tax authority. (Tr. 33)
She has never been arrested or convicted. (Tr. 33; GE 1) She passed a DOD lifestyle
polygraph. (Tr. 33) She has built a profitable company and provided important support to
the U.S. Government. She assured her tax problems will not recur. (Tr. 33)
