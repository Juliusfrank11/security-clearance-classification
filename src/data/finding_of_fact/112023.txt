After a careful and thorough of the pleadings, the testimony at the hearing, and the
documentary evidence, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant,  38,  is employed  by  a  defense  contractor  performing  design  work.  He
has  held  a  security  clearance  since  2004  or  2005.  He  began  working  for  his  current
clearance  sponsor  in  December  2015.  From  November  2013  to  December  2015,  he
worked for a different federal contractor. According to his SCA, he worked for a company
that  was  not  a federal  contractor from  December  2012  through  October  2013.  Prior to
that, he was unemployed for a period of eight or nine months in 2012. He disclosed in his
SCA that he was fired in April 2012 from his prior employment for “job abandonment.” In
that position, he was working in a combat zone in Country A. Since 2005, he had been
performing similar work in Country A and in a second combat zone, in Country B. He has
also  worked  in  several  European  countries  at  various  times  during  the  2005  to  2012
period. He has not worked overseas since 2011 or early 2012. He earned a high school
diploma in 1999 and has participated in a specialized, week-long course in his field of
employment. He married his long-time girlfriend in 2016 after he submitted his July 25,
2016 SCA. They have four children, ages, 12, 8, 6, and 5. (Tr. 15, 63-64, 71; GE 1 at 11-
19, 25, 28-30; GE 2, GE 3 at 6.)
Guideline G
Applicant’s Alcohol Consumption and DUI Arrests, SOR ¶¶ 2.a through 2.g
(and Guideline E cross-allegation, SOR ¶ 3.b): Applicant admitted each of the seven
SOR allegations under Guideline G. In 2009, while working as a contractor in Country A,
Applicant drank homemade wine for several hours in his employer’s housing on a military
base. The alcohol content in the wine was high. While intoxicated, he drove to another
part of the base where food was available. He does not recall the drive because of his
intoxication. He was stopped by the military police and detained overnight. As a result of
his actions, his driving privileges on the base were restricted. He received no reprimand
from  his  employer  because,  he  suspects,  his  supervisor  “hid”  the  incident  from  the
company’s  U.S.  managers.  Had  the  incident  been  reported  to  the  managers,  he  was
afraid that the incident would have resulted in serious consequences because his actions
were a violation of the U.S. Military’s General Order No. 1 for all U.S. military and civilian
personnel working in Country A. After this incident, he stopped drinking alcohol for eight
months to a year, but then resumed, even though it was not permitted. At times, he would
drink to excess and become intoxicated. (Tr. 73-75, 124-126; GE 1 at 39; GE 2; GE 3 at
7.)
In early 2012, Applicant came home on leave and then deferred returning to his
job  in  Country  A  due  to  a  concern  about  one  of  his  children.  He  and  his  wife,  then-
girlfriend, had ended their relationship at that time. He was “going through a hard time.”
On May 16, 2012, he went to a bar “just to calm down” and get out of his house. He felt
intoxicated when he left the bar. As he drove his car onto the street, he was stopped by
the  police  for failing  to  turn  on  his  headlights.  His  BAC  tested  at  0.13.  He  pleaded  no
contest to a charge of DUI and was ordered to take a three-month alcohol course for first-
time offenders and to serve a three-year period of probation. He completed the course in
December 2012. He stopped drinking alcohol for a while, but then began drinking again.
(Tr. 69-70, 76-80, 126-128, 136-137; GE 1 at 40-41; GE 2; GE 3 at 7; AE M.)
On June 3, 2013, he was arrested again for DUI. He claims he took an Ambien pill
due  to  sleep  problems  and  then  had  a  verbal  fight  with  his  wife  and  started  drinking
alcohol. He does not recall what happened after that. He knows that he woke up in jail
the  next  morning.  He  was  told  that  he  drove  his  wife’s  car  and  hit  a  curb  or  a  rock
damaging a wheel. His BAC was 0.14. He again pleaded no contest to the charge of DUI
and was ordered to continue on probation until the end of 2018. He was also ordered to
take an 18-month, second-offender DUI course that met weekly. He was terminated from
the course for excessive absenteeism, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Following
a court proceeding, he was reinstated in the course, and the warrant was dismissed. He
completed the course in February 2016. According to GE 4, the FBI Identification Report,
Applicant was also sentenced to serve 40 days in jail. During the probationary period, he
knew  that  if  he  experienced  another DUI  conviction,  he  would  be  incarcerated for one
year. He believes that he would  also go to jail for one year if he was convicted of DUI
after the termination of his probation. Applicant held a security clearance at the time of
each  of  his  three  DUI  arrests.  He  reported  the  two  more  recent  arrests  to  his  current
employer knowing that his security clearance would require renewal in 2016. (Tr. 69-70,
76-80, 126-128, 136-137; GE 1 at 42-43; GE 2; GE 3 at 7-8; GE 4 at 2; AE M.)
Applicant  provided  records  of  his  alcohol  courses  and  treatment.  He  has  never
voluntarily entered AA or a similar program for persons who have problems with alcohol.
He continues to drink alcohol socially. He currently has no formal support network in case
he experiences a significant stressor and desires to drink alcohol excessively again. (AE
L, M; Tr. 131-132.)
Applicant  was  raised  by  alcoholic  parents  and  learned  to  cope  with  them  by
drinking alcohol, starting at a young age. He believes that he presently has a problem
with drinking “to a certain extent.” He has never been diagnosed as having an alcohol use
disorder. The last time he drank alcohol was one week prior to the hearing, when he and
his wife had a couple of glasses of wine at their home. He now drinks about once a month,
usually with his wife at home. He last drank excessively at a friend’s house three months
prior to the hearing. His wife drove him home. He no longer drinks and drives and does
not drink around his children. As noted below, his wife testified earlier in the hearing and
gave conflicting evidence, testifying that she last saw him drink alcohol six months ago.
(Tr. 81-86, 133; GE 2 at 8.)
Guideline E
Marijuana Use, SOR ¶ 3.a: Applicant admits this allegation. In March 2011, while
home on leave from his job in Country A, he drank an excessive amount of alcohol and
was severely intoxicated. While intoxicated, he smoked marijuana with a cousin. The next
morning, he did not recall the incident until his wife advised him what he had done.  He
held a security clearance at the time. Applicant failed to disclose this use of an illegal drug
in his SCA. In his March 2016 background interview, he reported that he had not smoked
marijuana  since  2002,  which  was  false.  He  failed  to  correct  this  misstatement  in  his
responses to interrogatories, though he made several other corrections and clarifications.
In a follow-up interview in December 2017, he disclosed the March 2011 marijuana use.
He testified that he has not used marijuana since this incident in 2011. (Tr. 60-61, 86-87;
GE 3 at 9, 17.)
Guideline F
Late-Filed  Tax  Returns  for  Tax  Years  2010  and  2011,  SOR  ¶  1.a:  Applicant
admitted this allegation. While working in Country A in 2010 and 2011, Applicant failed to
file his state and federal tax returns for tax years (TY) 2010 on time. When he returned to
the United States in February 2012, he had a month or two to file his 2011 tax returns.
He believes he filed for extensions while he was in Country A. He testified that with the
help of a CPA, he filed his 2010 and 2011 tax returns in 2013 or 2014 and owed $3,500.
He  provided  no  documentary  evidence  to  show  that  he  filed  his  TY  2010  returns.  He
testified further that the IRS offset his tax refund for TY 2012 of $5,500 by the amount of
his unpaid taxes and fees for 2010 and 2011. Applicant’s Exhibit D actually reflects that
he filed his TY 2012 federal return on October 3, 2013. This exhibit also shows that no
refund was due because he made no withholding tax payments that year. Also, Applicant
provided no evidence to show that he filed for an extension to submit his TY 2012 returns
on  or  before  October 15,  2013.  His  evidence  further  shows  that  he  filed  his  2011  and
2013 tax returns on May 29, 2014. Accordingly, Applicant’s documentary evidence fails
to establish that he filed his TY 2010 returns and  reflects that his returns for TY 2011,
2012, and 2013 were not filed timely, though the SOR only alleged that Applicant untimely
filed his TY 2010 and 2011 returns. He has timely filed his subsequent tax returns using
a tax professional. (Tr. 102-105, 119-121; AE C, D, and E.)
Mortgage Foreclosure, SOR ¶ 1.b: Applicant admitted this allegation. As noted,
Applicant left his job in Country A and returned to the United States in or about February
2012. He testified that during the following 18-month period, he was unemployed for about
15 months. His SCA reflects that he was only unemployed from March 2012 to November
2012. He and his brother, who also worked in Country A, had jointly purchased a home
in 2007 (House 1) and jointly paid the monthly payments on a mortgage loan that they
used  to  buy  the  residence.  At  some  point,  his  brother  decided  to  stop  paying  the
mortgage, even though he was living in House 1 at the time with his girlfriend and her four
children. As a result, Applicant had to continue paying the entire monthly mortgage. His
brother wanted to buy a new house, and Applicant loaned his brother $17,000 so he could
buy the house and move out of House 1. Applicant had significant savings from his job
working in Country A. He testified that his savings eventually “ran out” and he could no
longer  pay  the  mortgage.  Government  Exhibits  5  and  8  and  AE  A  reflect  that  the  last
payment on this mortgage loan was in April 2012, shortly after Applicant returned from
Country A, left his job, and was unemployed. He testified further that he actually used his
remaining savings to purchase a second house (House 2). He clarified that he “paid [the
mortgage on House 1] until I found other - - another property to buy.” In August 2012, he
purchased House 2 for his family in a cash transaction without a mortgage loan. He was
unemployed at the time. His financial resources were very limited after his purchase of
House 2, and he sold the house in November 2014. The record is silent as to what he did
with the proceeds of the sale of House 2. (Tr. 87-91, 109, 112; GE 1 at 8-9, 15; GE 5 at
5; GE 8 at 5; AE A at 9-10.)
In September 2012, the mortgage on House 1 went into foreclosure. The amount
of the outstanding balance of the mortgage loan was about $260,000. The house was
only worth about $120,000. The foreclosure was completed in January 2013. Applicant
testified  that  before  the  foreclosure  was  finalized,  he  tried  to  do  a  short  sale,  but  was
unsuccessful. He also said, without any explanation, that after his default on the mortgage
payments, it was too late to avoid the foreclosure on House 1. He did not provide any
testimony  regarding  attempts  to  rent  House  1  before  defaulting  on  the  mortgage.
Following the foreclosure, he was not responsible for the significant deficiency as a result
of a state anti-deficiency statute. (Tr. 90, 115-116.)
Credit Union Line of Credit Account Charged-Off in the Amount of $24,352, SOR ¶
1.c: Applicant admitted this allegation. In 2003, he obtained an unsecured $25,000 line
of credit (LOC) from a credit union. He borrowed against the LOC and repaid it several
times over the years. More recently, he borrowed about $24,000, possibly in connection
with  his  purchase  of  House  2  in  August  2012,  and  has  not  paid  anything  to  the  credit
union since early 2013. The lender has charged-off the loan. Applicant testified that he
intends  to  repay  this  loan  in  the  future  even  though  he  believes  it  is  no  longer  an
enforceable obligation. He is unable to pay this debt at this time. (Tr. 91-93; GE 8 at 2;
AE A at 5-6; AE B at 35.)
Bank  Loan  Account  Charged-Off  in  the  Amount  of  $16,417,  SOR  ¶  1.d:  Applicant
admitted this allegation. In 2007, he borrowed money to purchase a “travel trailer,” which
he  used  as  his  residence  whenever  he  returned  to  the  United  States  from  his  work
locations abroad. He financed the purchase with a bank loan of about $16,000. His wife
became pregnant with their first child, and Applicant wanted his family to have a house to
live in while he worked in Country A. As noted, he and his brother bought House 1 in 2007
for his brother’s girlfriend and her children. Applicant co-owned this house so that his wife
and child could live in it as well. She only lived there for a brief period, choosing to live
with her mother while Applicant was in Country A. Applicant kept making payments on
the trailer until “times became too tough,” and in 2013, he voluntarily gave it back in a
repossession.  The  trailer  was  sold  at  auction,  and  Applicant  is  responsible  for  the
deficiency on the outstanding loan balance in the amount of about $7,390. He has made
no payments on this debt since the repossession. (Tr. 93-96; GE 8 at 2; AE A at 11.)
Two Delinquent Credit-Card Accounts, Two Delinquent Cellphone Accounts, and a
Delinquent Medical Account, SOR ¶¶ 1.e through 1.i: Applicant admits these debts
except SOR ¶¶ 1.g (cellphone debt for $91) and 1.i (medical debt for $2,102). Applicant
provided no evidence that he has paid the admitted debts, which total about $3,143, since
he  submitted  his  June  2018  SOR  response.  He  believes  the  medical  debt  and  the
cellphone  debts  have  been  paid.  He  provided  no  evidence  of  payments  of  these  two
debts.  He  provided  a  large  amount  of  evidence,  but  failed  to  specify  the  documents
reflecting  his  payments  of  these  two  debts.  After  a  careful  review  of  all  of  Applicant’s
documentary evidence, I was unable to identify such evidence. Accordingly, these five
debts remain unpaid. He has made no payment plans with any of these creditors, nor has
he provided evidence that he has  tried to contact them regarding these debts. (Tr. 97-
100, 117; GE 6 at 3-4, 9; AE A at 8-9, 13-14.)
Applicant has not sought any financial counseling, other than for the tax assistance
he received from a CPA. Since he married in 2016, he and his wife combine their finances,
and together, they earn a significant income. They live in a modest home and do not have
an extravagant lifestyle. (Tr. 63-64, 117; AE K, Q.)
Four character witnesses testified at the hearing. Applicant’s immediate supervisor
described  Applicant  as  reliable  and  hard  working.  She  also  described  him  as  honest,
trustworthy, and a model employee, who consistently meets her deadlines. A co-worker
and  casual  friend  testified  that  Applicant  does  not  have  an  extravagant  lifestyle  and
spends  his  available  money  on  his  children.  This  witness  described  Applicant  as
trustworthy  and  honest.  Another  co-worker  and  personal  friend  testified  that  he  sees
Applicant outside of work often. He believes that Applicant is trustworthy, honest, and a
valuable  employee.  He  explained  that  Applicant  and  his  family  live  as  permanent
residents in a camping facility. He testified that Applicant has lived at the facility for about
a year and one-half so that he can save money to buy a house for his family. This friend
stated that he has never seen Applicant drink alcohol nor has Applicant ever informed
this witness whether or not he drinks alcohol. (Tr. 14-22, 24-29, 31- 37.)
The  fourth  witness  was  Applicant’s  wife.  She  works  as  a  licensed  professional.
She has known Applicant for 15 years. During the period October 2011 to May 2012, they
had  broken  up  as  a  couple.  She  and  their  two  children  at  the  time  were  living  at  her
mother’s residence. She testified that when he returned to the United States in February
2012, they had “broke[n] up because he was out there, and so he quit his job to come
home.” (Tr. 34-47, 61.)
Applicant’s wife testified about his criminal history related to drinking alcohol. He
had told his wife about his 2009 DUI incident when he was working in Country A. She
was not with him when he was arrested for DUI in 2012 during a two-week leave when
he was home, but she received a call from him the next morning asking to be picked up
at the police station. She testified that he went to a bar by himself and drank too much.
After this incident, he stopped drinking and returned to House 1. At that time, she did not
reside at that house. She also testified about his third alcohol arrest in 2013 after they
had reconciled and were again living together. She said that he blacked out after drinking
alcohol  and  taking  an  Ambien  pill.  She  felt  that  his  intoxication  was  the  result  of  the
combination of the alcohol and medication and was accidental. She testified that he has
not consumed any alcohol for the last three or four years, though she also testified that
she last saw him drink six months prior to the hearing at a party. Her claim that he was
abstinent over the preceding six months was contradicted by Applicant and is not credible.
(Tr. 38-47, 57-58, 64.)
Applicant’s wife also testified about Applicant’s finances. His financial difficulties
began in 2012 after he quit his job in Country A. He had previously obtained the LOC,
and in 2013, he used funds from that account to purchase House 2. She also testified
that he “paid cash for [House 2],” explaining that the cash came from his savings from his
work in Country A. She testified that he had no job for a period of about 18 months after
returning from Country A in February 2012. As a result, he sold the house and made a
profit. She did not explain why the LOC was not paid off when the house was sold. She
also testified that Applicant’s debts started to increase during his unemployment. She said
that  she  was  employed  during  this  period.  Since  he  became  employed,  Applicant  has
paid  pursuant  to  payment  plans  the  uninsured  portions  of  medical  bills  he  incurred  in
connection with a surgery. He also paid off a credit card. Neither account is the subject
of an SOR allegation. She testified that Applicant had a voluntary repossession of a trailer
in 2012. She is unaware of the final status of Applicant’s loan on the trailer. She testified
that she and Applicant had saved some emergency money by living in a camping facility,
but not enough to pay off his debts or to buy a house. (Tr. 48-55.)
