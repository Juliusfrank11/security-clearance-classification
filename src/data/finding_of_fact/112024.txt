In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through
1.h, 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c. (HE 3) He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 3.a. He also
provided extenuating and mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  a  46-year-old  senior  systems  administrator  working  for  a  defense
contractor. (Tr. 18-20; GE 1) In 1992, he graduated from high school, and in 1996, he
graduated from college. (Tr. 19) He has never served in the military. (Tr. 19) He majored
in computer science. (Tr. 19) He has never married, and he has four children who are
ages 13, 19, 23, and 25. (Tr. 18) Since 1996, he has been employed working for a defense
contractor without periods of unemployment until his security clearance was revoked on
July 19, 2019. (Tr. 20) He has held a DOD security clearance for at least 20 years. (Tr.
25, 71) There is no evidence of a security violation.
When Applicant’s security clearance was revoked, he lost his employment with a
DOD  contractor,  and  he  filed  for  unemployment.  (Tr.  26)  Despite  having  20  years  of
information  technology  experience  and  a  college  degree,  he  was  unable  to  find
information  technology  employment  without  a  security  clearance.  (Tr.  26)  He  found  it
heartbreaking to be unable to use his skills to contribute to DOD. (Tr. 26) On November
1, 2019, he found employment, but now he has to commute 51 miles from his home on
dangerous highways, and for reduced pay. (Tr. 26)
Applicant explained the source of his financial problems and why he should have
a security clearance:
For 25 years I’ve performed my duties as a government contractor with prior
loyalty  and  commitment.  I  was  excited  about  the  work  I  was  doing  as  a
senior system administrator for the [DOD contractor] and looking forward to
the opportunities ahead of me with a top secret security clearance as high-
performance computing continues to advance. I was good at my job; my co-
workers  held  me  with  high  regards.  As  you  can  see  by  the  performance
reviews and letters of recommendation provided.
*  *  *
I’m  a  good  person  who  has made  some  mistakes, but  I  would  never sell
classified information. I love my country; I may have [fallen] upon some hard
times financially, been the sole source of income with dependent children. I
may have gotten into trouble when my mom was sick and the mother of my
children left home after 20 years together.
I was taking care of my sick mom and dealing with the pain of a love lost. I
admit my mistakes; I have learned from my mistakes, and I’ve grown and
moved on from my mistakes. I am worthy of a top secret clearance, and I
will serve my country well with it just as I did with my secret clearance.
However,  Your  Honor,  if  you  do  [not]  see  fit  for me  to  have  a  top  secret
clearance,  I  ask  you  [to  grant  my  request]  to  keep  my  secret  clearance,
which was revoked, so I can find work closer to home and not have to travel
up and down a dangerous highway. (Tr. 25-27, 35)
Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges the following financial allegations:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant owes $4,860 for a  charged-off debt. Applicant
incurred the debt to install floors in his residence. (Tr. 41) On March 22, 2019, the creditor
offered to settle the debt for $2,916; however, the payment would have to be made by
the March 29, 2019, or the settlement offer would be null and void. (AE N) Applicant failed
to provide any documentation showing that he settled this account or made payments to
the creditor. (Tr. 41-42; GE 2; GE 3; GE 4)
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.i allege that Applicant owes about $2,000 for a charged-off credit
card account. On March 22, 2018, the creditor obtained a judgment against Applicant for
$1,838. (GE 7) Applicant settled this credit card debt after making two $800 payments in
late 2018. (Tr. 42-43; GE 3; AE E) On October 5, 2018, the creditor wrote that the debt
was settled. (AE E)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  that  Applicant  owes  $927  for  a  telecommunications  account
referred for collection. Applicant made some payments on this account, and he returned
equipment to the creditor. (Tr. 43-45) On April 13, 2019, the creditor wrote the balance
owed  was  $536.  (AE  O)  The  current  remaining  balance  owed  to  this  creditor  is  about
$450. (Tr. 45-46; GE 3; GE 4; AE G; AE H; AE O) He would have made more payments
except he was unemployed after he lost his security clearance. (Tr. 46)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges that Applicant owes $141 for his car insurance. He provided
documentation with his SOR response showing that he paid this debt. (Tr. 46-47; GE 3;
GE 4)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  that  Applicant  owes  $102  for  a  medical  account  referred  for
collection. Applicant provided a receipt with his SOR response showing that this account
was paid. (Tr. 47; GE 3)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges that Applicant owes $21,777 in delinquent Federal income taxes
for  tax  years  2015  and  2016.  In  March  2015,  a  creditor  forgave  a  mortgage  debt  for
$25,526, and the IRS determined he received income when the creditor forgave this debt.
(Tr. 48-49; GE 1 at 36-37; GE 2 at 29; GE 5 at 32; AE J) He also withdrew $24,000 from
his 401(k) account and was unable to repay his account in time to avoid a federal income
tax  penalty.  (Tr.  48-49)  In  his  December  21,  2016  SCA,  Applicant  stated  he  was  in  a
payment  plan,  and  he  was  making  $228  monthly  payments  to  the  Internal  Revenue
Service (IRS). (GE 1 at 37-38; GE 2 at 29) Applicant subsequently stopped making his
monthly payments. (Tr. 48; GE 2 at 29) His  plan was “to  let them take my income tax
[refund] in addition to [his] monthly payments.” (Tr. 28; GE 5)
As of May 2018, the IRS tax transcript for tax  year 2015 showed that Applicant
owed $14,353. His 2016 tax transcript showed that his delinquent tax debt was $7,424.
Applicant’s 2017 tax refund was intercepted and applied to his delinquent accounts owed
for tax years 2013, 2014, and the remainder of $1,917 was applied to his debt for tax year
2015. (GE 5)

For tax year 2012, Applicant paid the IRS $385 in April 2014, resolving his tax debt
for tax year 2012. (GE 5 at 1) For tax year 2013, he made payments to the IRS in February
2015, April 2015, and April 2016. (GE 5 at 2-3) His payments in August and September
2017 were dishonored. (GE 5 at 3) In February 2018, the IRS transferred a $281 credit
from tax year 2017, and his tax debt for tax year 2013 was resolved. (GE 5 at 2-3)
In 2017, the IRS dishonored three payments toward his tax debt for tax year 2014.
(GE 5 at 5) In February 2018, the IRS transferred a $2,695 credit from tax year 2017, and
his tax debt for tax year 2014 was resolved. (GE 5 at 5)
For tax year 2015, Applicant made $227 payments in April and November 2016.
(GE 5 at 7) In February 2018, the IRS transferred a $1,917 credit from tax year 2017. (GE
5 at 7) The balance owed was $14,353 as of May 25, 2018. (GE 5 at 6)
For tax year 2016, Applicant made the following payments: $100 (August 2017);
$200 (September 2017); $328 (October 2017); and $328 (December 2017). (GE 5 at 8)
The balance owed as of May 25, 2018, is $7,424. (GE 5 at 8)
In  sum,  Applicant’s  federal  income  taxes  for  tax  years  2013  and  2014  were
delinquent until Applicant’s refund for tax year 2017 was transferred in February 2018.
(GE 5 at 10) As of May 25, 2018, his tax debt for tax years 2015 and 2016 is $21,777.
(GE  5)  He  did  not  provide  proof  of  any  federal  income  tax  payments  to  address  his
ongoing tax debt for tax years 2015 and 2016 after December 2017.
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges that Applicant owes $2,466 for a state tax lien entered against
him in 2017. On October 14, 2019, the state obtained a judgment against Applicant for
$2,466. (GE 6) Applicant planned to gradually reduce the debt through the state taking
his refunds, and then he would pay off the debt when it was low enough. (Tr. 50; GE 5 at
30) Applicant did not have a state-approved payment plan to address this debt. (Tr. 50)
SOR  ¶  1.h  alleges  that  Applicant  owes  real  estate  taxes  to  a  city  totaling
approximately $9,000 for tax years 2008 through 2016. Applicant stopped paying his real
estate  taxes  in  2008.  (GE  5  at  30-31)  In  2016,  he  made  $225  monthly  payments  for
several months. (GE 5 at 31) In June 2016, he received a $9,000 bill for real estate taxes.
(GE 5 at 31) Applicant said he is making monthly $50 payments, and he paid $51 in March
2019, September 2019, and December 2019. (Tr. 51; GE 2; GE 5 at 31; AE I, AE J; AE
R)
Applicant’s gross annual income was about $82,000 before his security clearance
was revoked. (Tr. 53) His adjusted gross income on his federal income tax return for tax
years 2015 and 2016 were anomalous because a creditor forgave a mortgage debt and
his withdrawal from his 401(k) account resulted in a higher income than he actually had
available to pay his debts. (Tr. 53) He started new employment on November 1, 2019,
and his new salary is $70,000 annually. (Tr. 55)
Alcohol Consumption
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges that Applicant was arrested in March 2015 for speeding and
operating  a  vehicle  while  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  (OVI).  The  police  stopped
Applicant for speeding, and they smelled alcohol on his breath. (Tr. 56) Applicant said he
did  not  remember  his  breathalyzer  test  or  blood  alcohol  test  (BAT)  result.  (Tr.  56)
However, he conceded his BAT result was above the legal limit. (Tr. 72) The court record
shows a .14 BAT result. (GE 8 at 1, 3) Applicant pleaded guilty to OVI first offense, and
the speeding charge was dismissed. (SOR response) Applicant was sentenced to a fine
and court costs, 180 days in jail with 177 days suspended, and one year of probation.
(GE 8 at 1) Applicant was required to attend a three-day alcohol awareness course and
his  driver’s  license  was  suspended  for  six  months.  (Tr.  56;  GE  1;  GE  2;  GE  8;  SOR
response)
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges that Applicant was arrested in May 2016 and charged with OVI
and physical control. Applicant had consumed some alcohol. He was on his way home,
and he decided to pull over to the side of the road where he fell asleep. (Tr. 58-59) The
police arrived and arrested him. The police said he did not blow into the breathalyzer hard
enough to register, and the police declared it to be a refusal. (Tr. 72) He pleaded guilty to
physical control, and the OVI was dismissed. (Tr. 59; SOR response; GE 8 at 5) He was
fined, paid court costs, and placed on five years of community control. (Tr. 73; GE 1, GE
2, GE 8) Applicant was unsure what “community control” entailed. (Tr. 73-74) During his
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview, he said he was prohibited from having
any similar incidents. (GE 2 at 26)
SOR ¶ 2.c alleges that Applicant was arrested in April 2018 for physical control of
vehicle  while  under  the  influence  of  alcohol.  Applicant  was  moving  his  vehicle  in  the
driveway  of  his  residence  and  honking  the  horn  at  his  cohabitant  who  was  inside  the
residence. (GE 2 at 17) His cohabitant called the police. (GE 2 at 17) The police described
Applicant as being “highly intoxicated.” (GE 2 at 17, 21) His speech was slurred, and he
was unable to stand without assistance. (GE 2 at 21) Applicant told the police “he had
been drinking all day and night.” (GE 2 at 18) He refused a breathalyzer test. (Tr. 73) The
police  seized  a  Xanax  pill  that  was  in  his  pocket.  (GE  2  at  18)  Applicant  was  initially
charged  with  physical  control  and  possession  of  drugs,  but  he  pleaded  guilty  to  an
amended  charge  of  reckless  operation,  and  the  possession  of  drugs  charge  was
dismissed. (Tr. 60-61; GE 8 at 7)
There is no evidence that Applicant was diagnosed with an alcohol-use disorder.
Applicant  did  not  attend  any  Alcoholics  Anonymous  meetings  or  receive  any  other
outpatient  treatment for alcohol consumption.  (Tr. 73)  His  most  recent  consumption  of
alcohol was 30 days before his hearing when he consumed two or three beers. (Tr. 74-
75)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The SOR alleges in ¶ 3.a that Applicant used Xanax, without a prescription, on at
least  three  occasions,  until  at  least  2018,  while  he  held  a  security  clearance.  When
Applicant was arrested in April 2018, the police searched him and found a green pill inside
a baggie in his pants pocket. (Tr.  62; GE 2 at 18) Applicant stated, “Oh, that’s just my
Xanax.” (Tr. 62; GE 2 at 18) Xanax is a Schedule IV Controlled Substance. Applicant told
the police that he did not have a prescription for the Xanax. (Tr. 62; GE 2 at 18) At his
hearing,  Applicant  said  that  he  did  not  “have  any  recollection”  of  having  Xanax  in  his
pocket when he was arrested, and he “was made aware of it when [he] read his [police]
statement.” (Tr. 63) He did not remember telling the police officer the pill was Xanax. (Tr.
75) Applicant suggested he may not remember what he told the police because he was
intoxicated. (Tr. 75)
The possession of Xanax charge was subsequently dismissed. Applicant admitted
that he took Xanax at least once as recently as 2018. (Tr. 67-69) He was uncertain how
many times he used Xanax, and he refused to estimate how many times he took Xanax
without a prescription. (Tr. 67-69) He has never had a prescription for Xanax. (Tr. 71)
Character Evidence
The mother of Applicant’s children described him as a good provider and father
figure. (Tr. 29, 33) She has lived with him most of the time for 23 years. (Tr. 30) In the
past year, he dramatically reduced his alcohol consumption because of health concerns
relating  to  high  blood  pressure  and  cholesterol.  (Tr.  30,  33-34)  She  has  not  seen  him
drink any alcohol for six months. (Tr. 31) They have not had any alcohol in their home for
six  months.  (Tr.  31-32)  She  does  not  use  illegal  drugs,  and  she  is  unaware  of  the
presence of any illegal drugs in their home. (Tr. 32)
Five  coworkers,  colleagues,  and/or  friends  provided  character  statements
supporting reinstatement of Applicant’s access to classified information. (AE A; AE B; AE
C; AE D; AE Q) The general sense of their statements is that Applicant is honest, diligent,
knowledgeable,  intelligent,  generous,  courteous,  loyal,  respectful,  kind,  reliable,  and
trustworthy. (AE A; AE B; AE C; AE D) His performance evaluations describe him as an
excellent employee who made substantial contributions to mission accomplishment. (AE
K; AE L; AE P) He received salary increases in 2015 ($1,094) and 2016 ($1,034). (AE K;
AE L)
