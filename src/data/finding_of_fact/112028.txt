The SOR alleged that Applicant has 13 delinquent accounts totaling $51,045, of
which $49,614 are student loans. (SOR ¶ 1.) Applicant admitted all of those accounts,
except for two medical accounts ($645 and $359), of which he denied any knowledge.
(Answer.) Those medical debts appear on the 2017 credit report, but the $359 debt does
not appear on the 2018 credit report. (GE 3; GE 2.) In his security clearance application,
Applicant disclosed eight student loan debts, one medical debt, and one consumer debt.
In making those disclosures of student loan debts, he stated:
“Until recently, I didn’t have an understanding or clear knowledge of the multiple
loans  and  dollar  amounts.  Since  pulling  my  credit  report  and  going  through  it  for  this
application I can now approach how to move forward on this debt . . . . Contacting debtor
[sic – he meant creditor] for payment arrangements.”(GE 1.)
By the time Applicant filed his Answer, he had payment plans in place for each of
the alleged student loans. (Answer.) By the time of his hearing, he had been adhering to
his payment plans or had otherwise resolved his SOR debts. (Tr. 39-40, 43, 47-50; AE A;
AE B; AE C.) Applicant embarked on paying delinquent debts before he completed his
security application in 2017. (GE 1.)
Applicant testified about the circumstances that caused his financial problems. He
explained  that  when  he  graduated  from  college,  he  had  difficulty  finding  a  good  job.
Applicant’s current job is steady. Applicant testified that receiving the SOR “incentivized
him to work on his [student] debt.” Applicant embarked on paying student loan delinquent
debts before he completed his security application in 2017. (GE 1.) He began payments
on his student loan plans in July 2018. (Tr. 39, 54.) Applicant’s post-graduate employment
history above supports that explanation.
Applicant  testified  about  his  household  finances.  They  are  also  set  forth  in  a
student Loan Rehabilitation Income and Expense form completed in July 2018 attached
to his Answer, It and his testimony show that he is living within his means. Applicant is
current on all expenses and on his state and federal income taxes. (Answer; Tr. 50-53.)

professional and proficient manner.” (AE C.)
