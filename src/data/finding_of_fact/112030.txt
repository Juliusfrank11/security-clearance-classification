In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f.
She did not admit or deny the delinquent debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g. Her admissions have
been incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for
her current employer since November 2018. She has never held a security clearance or
eligibility for a public trust position.
Applicant attended college from October 2000 to September 2001 and received a
certificate of completion for training as a legal office assistant. She attended college from
January 2006 to August 2007 and October 2009 to September 2011 but did not receive
a degree. She has student loans totaling about $74,000, on which deferment ended in
December 2018. (Tr. 69.) The student loans are not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant married in July 2011. (GX 1 at 6.) Around December 2011, her husband
left her. She filed for divorce in 2012, and the divorce was final in May 2014. She has an
11-year-old daughter from her previous marriage, for whom she receives child-support
payments of $800 per month. She also has a 15-year-old son from a previous relationship,
for whom she receives child support of $147 per month. She remarried in 2017 and has
a 19-month-old daughter from this marriage. (GX 2 at 2-3; Tr. 30-31.)
Applicant  has  worked  for  federal  contractors  since  at  least  February  2002  as  a
receptionist,  technical  assistant,  executive  assistant,  administrative  specialist,  human-
resources  specialist,  performance-management  analyst,  and  payroll
time-and-
attendance  specialist.  She  was  unemployed  from  June  to  November  2011,  when  her
employer’s contract ended. Her previous jobs did not offer medical insurance, and she
incurred debts for medical care. She had a full-time day job and worked at full-time night
jobs at fast-food restaurants during the summer of 2012. She worked part time at a fast-
food restaurant for three months in 2012 or 2013. (GX 2 at 2.) In each case, she quit her
night job because she was physically unable to work two jobs.
Applicant  purchased  a  home  in  2005  with  an  adjustable-rate  mortgage.  Her
husband’s pay was reduced when he was moved from a supervisory position to a lower-

otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
paying  non-supervisory  position.  (Tr.  46.)  They  filed  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in
September 2007 because they could not afford to pay the mortgage loan and could not
obtain  a  loan  modification.  The  bankruptcy  also  included  her  then  husband’s  car  loan,
medical bills, and her then husband’s credit-card debt. They received a discharge in June
2009. About $259,000-$280,000 was discharged. (GX 2 at 5; Tr. 32.)
After Applicant’s first husband left her, she remained in the marital home, which
she had purchased in July 2010. Her mother, who has since passed away, also was living
with and supported by her. Applicant stayed in the marital home for about two months,
moved in with a friend, and then sold the marital home in a short sale. The credit report
from  April  2017  reflects  that  the  mortgage  loan  was  paid.  (GX  4  at  1.)  Her  friend  was
retired  military  and  employed  full  time.  They  agreed  to  split  their  living  expenses,  but
Applicant found herself paying most of the expenses. She could not afford to move out,
and so she continued to live with her friend for about two years. (Tr. 37-39.)
Around 2015, Applicant began living with a co-worker, and they married in 2017.
(Tr.  30.)  Her  current  husband  is  retired  military  and  she  is  entitled  to  military  medical
benefits  as  a  military  family  member.  Her  current  husband  has  given  her  financial
guidance and has joined her in managing the family finances. (Tr. 40-41.) She testified
that her husband has prepared a spreadsheet for her, setting out a plan to resolve her
delinquent debts. It lists specific creditors and specific payment amounts to each creditor.
She did not submit the spreadsheet at the hearing. She promised to submit a copy of it,
but it was not included in her post-hearing submission. (Tr. 75-76.)
The  SOR  alleges  the  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  (SOR  ¶  1.a),  a  delinquent  car  loan
(SOR ¶ 1.b), and five medical debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.g). The bankruptcy and delinquent
debts are reflected in credit reports from November 2018 (GX 3), April 2017 (GX 4), and
October 2014 (GX 5.)
The allegations of delinquent medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.g do not comply with
the requirement for specificity in Directive ¶ E3.1.3, which requires that the SOR “shall be
as  detailed  and  comprehensive  as  the  national  security  permits.”  The  SOR  does  not
identify  the  creditors  or  collection  agents  and  provides  no  account  numbers.  The  April
2017 credit report on which they are based lists only the date each account was opened.
However, Applicant was able to track down each of these medical debts. The evidence
concerning the delinquent debts is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.b: delinquent car loan charged off for $10,375. Applicant testified that
this  debt  was  jointly  incurred  during  her  previous  marriage.  (Tr.  47.)  The  account  was
opened in December 2011, and the debt was charged off in June 2014. (GX 3 at 5; GX 5
at  3.)  In  a  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  in  November  2014,  Applicant  told  an
investigator  that  she  was  negotiating  with  this  creditor.  She  admitted  this  debt  in  her
answer to the SOR and stated that she would resolve it after she resolved other smaller
debts.  At  the  hearing,  she  testified  that  she  contacted  the  creditor  and  was  offered  a
settlement for $8,000, but she could not afford to accept it. (Tr. 47-48.) She did not provide
any documentary evidence of the settlement offer. In her post-hearing submission, she
asserted  that  this  creditor  informed  her  that  it  would  not  attempt  to  collect  this  debt
because it is barred by the statute of limitations. (AX D.) She provided no documentary
evidence to support her assertion regarding the statute of limitations.
SOR  ¶  1.c:  medical  debt  for  eye  surgery,  past  due  for  $172.  This  debt  was
incurred in December 2014, and the last payment was in March 2015. (GX 3 at 6; GX 4
at 2.) The total amount due on this debt is $2,826. (GX 4 at 2.) Applicant underwent laser
surgery after her vision declined and she began wearing glasses. She decided that the
surgery  made  more  financial  sense  than  paying  for  new  glasses  whenever  her  vision
changed. (Tr. 51.) Applicant has promised to make biweekly $75 payments beginning on
January  19,  2019.  (AX  I.)  As  of  the  date  the  record  closed,  she  had  not  made  any
payments.
SOR ¶¶ 1.d: medical debt for $651. This debt was incurred when Applicant went
to  an  emergency  room  after  an  automobile  accident  in  2013.  She  testified  that  she
disputed the amount of the debt because she left the emergency room for an unspecified
personal emergency before being treated. She settled the debt for a lesser amount on
November 30, 2018, after she received the SOR. (AX A; Tr. 53-54.)
SOR ¶ 1.e: medical debt for $331. This debt was paid in full on September 28,
2017, after Applicant received the SOR. (AX H.)
SOR ¶ 1.f: medical debt for $156. This debt was paid in full in March 2016. (AX
G.)
SOR ¶ 1.g: medical debt for $47. This debt was paid in full on January 9, 2017.
(AX F.)
Applicant’s annual pay is about $96,000, which is a substantial increase from her
previous job, which paid $65,000 per year. Her take-home pay ranges from about $2,000
to $2,300. She has no savings. (Tr. 80.) Her husband is retired military, and his annual
pay is about $104,000. (Tr. 80.) Applicant does not know how much he receives in military
retired  pay.  Her  husband  has  four  children  from  his  previous  marriage  and  pays  child
support for two of them. He also is still jointly liable for the mortgage payments on his
previous  marital  home.  (Tr.  88.)  Applicant’s  rent  is  $2,700.  She  pays  $1,700,  and  her
husband pays $1,000, plus the utilities. They have a monthly car payment of $554. (Tr.
67.) She did not provide any other information about her monthly living expenses.
Applicant testified that she did not contact the various creditors alleged in the SOR
until recently, because she did not have sufficient income to make payments, and she did
not want to make a payment agreement that she would be unable to afford. (Tr. 86.) Her
current employment contract is for three years, and she is confident that her income will
not decrease during the duration of the contract and may increase. (Tr. 83.)
