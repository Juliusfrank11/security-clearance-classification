Applicant,  56,  is  a  senior  software  systems  engineer  currently  employed  by  a
defense contractor since April 2008. He was previously employed in the same position by
defense contractors since at least 2002. Applicant worked as a Federal employee from
1988 until 1997. He earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering in 1985. He and
his wife married in 1982 and have three adult children. He was granted his first security
clearance in 1988. (GX 1.)
Under Guideline F, the SOR as amended alleges that Applicant failed to timely file
his state and federal tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2016. Applicant admits the
SOR allegations. The delinquent tax filings are documented in Applicant’s responses to
interrogatories, Answer, and documentary submissions. His admissions are incorporated
in my findings of fact.
Applicant does not have any formal training in tax preparation. He prepares and
files  his  own  tax  returns  using  tax-preparation  software,  due  in  large  measure  to  his
concern that accountants and tax preparers are likely targets of hacking. For many years,
Applicant erroneously believed that if he was entitled to a refund from the IRS, he was
not required to file his tax return on the annual deadline, but was instead required to file
within three years of the annual deadline or he would forfeit his refund. (GX 2; Tr. 37-38;
Answer.)  Applicant  also  stated  that  his  state  of  residence  withholds  refunds  after  two
years, so he historically tried to file his Federal and state taxes within two years of the
deadline. (Tr. 37-38.)
Applicant attributes his late tax filings primarily to the complexity of his taxes, his
misconception about filing requirements, and his efforts to maintain balance in his family
and work lives. (Answer.) The issues and events that Applicant identifies as having made
his tax accounting and preparation complex, and his filings and payments delinquent, are
discussed more fully below.
In 2002, Applicant’s wife was in a serious car accident in which she was gravely
injured. She suffered from ongoing health issues for many years that required frequent
medical attention. Applicant incurred significant medical costs, and itemized these on his
tax returns. (GX 2; Tr. 50.) Applicant’s wife’s health deteriorated in 2012 and 2013, and
she underwent surgery in 2014 as a result of the injuries she received in the accident.
Through  the  years,  Applicant  prioritized  his  wife’s  medical  care  and  concern  over  her
health over preparing his tax returns. (Answer.)
In  approximately  2008,  Applicant  started  a  two-pronged  business  venture.  He
purchased  a  used  recreational  vehicle  (RV)  with  the  intention  of  refurbishing  it  and
reselling it. He also bought an online subscription service that was theoretically designed
to  permit  Applicant  to  purchase  deeply  discounted  vacation  packages  to  resell.  A
component of the vacation-sale business was to recruit other people to purchase and sell
the packages, and Applicant would receive a percentage of their sales. Applicant did not
generate any reportable income from either part of the business, nor did he ever obtain a
business  license.  (GX  2;  Answer.)  However,  the  business  did  generate  expenses  that
Applicant itemized on his tax returns. Applicant did not keep business records in real time
and this complicated his ability to gather information in order to timely file his tax returns.
(Tr. 53-58.) Applicant officially closed the business in June 2016. (Answer.)
In tax year 2011, Applicant’s then-employer issued stock options to its employees,
including Applicant. Because of the way the employer issued the stock options, the value
of  the  options  was  imputed  to  the  employees  as  income,  which  necessarily  increased
their tax obligations. The employer sent Applicant an IRS Schedule K-1 that was incorrect.
Applicant contacted the employer, which in turn contacted the IRS to amend the Schedule
K-1s. It took several years for this issue to be corrected, and Applicant did not file his tax
returns  while  the  issue  was  pending.  (GX  2.)  It  is unclear  when  the  schedule  K-1  was
amended. Applicant sold the stocks in April 2017 and received his last Schedule K-1 in
March 2017. (Tr. 63-65.)
It took Applicant approximately 440 hours to do the accounting and tax preparation
for tax year 2014. Despite this large investment of time, Applicant miscalculated his tax
obligation and owed approximately $90. He filed the 2014 Federal return in July 2017,
and paid the amount due in September 2017. (GX 2; Tr. 45-46; Answer.)
Applicant  spoke  extensively  about  his  delinquent  tax  filings  during  his  personal
subject  interview  (PSI)  in  May  2015.  Applicant  identified tax  year  2011 as  the  year  he
began having difficulty in his tax accounting and preparation in both his e-QIP and his
PSI.  He  stated  because  of  his  difficulties  filing  his  2011  tax  returns,  he  was  unable  to
timely file 2012, 2013, and 2014. He filed his 2011 Federal return on April 21, 2015. He
anticipated filing his 2013 and 2014 tax returns soon. Additionally, the IRS sent inquiries
to Applicant for non-filing of tax returns in at least 2012, 2013, and 2016. (GX 2; Answer.)
Applicant signed his responses to DOHA’s interrogatories on October 4, 2017. The
interrogatories required Applicant to submit IRS account transcripts for tax years 2011
through  2016.  Applicant  stated  that  his  2016  state  and  Federal  tax  returns  remained
unfiled. However, his 2015 state and Federal returns were also unfiled. He filed his 2015
Federal return on October 10, 2017. Applicant filed for an extension for his 2016 Federal
return.  However,  he  missed  the  October  15,  2017,  deadline  and  filed  the  return  on
November 24, 2017. (GX 2; Tr. 43-45; Answer.).
The instructions section of IRS Form 1040, updated annually, specifically sets forth
the filing requirements for that tax year. For example, in 2011 married couples filing jointly
with  both  spouses  under  the  age  of  65  with  a  gross  income  of  at  least  $20,600  were
required to file a Federal return by April 18, 2016.1 Applicant’s income has exceeded the
annual minimum gross income for tax years 2011 through 2016.2 (Answer.) Applicant was
generally entitled to receive refunds from the IRS. However, he forfeited his 2011 refund
by  filing  the  return  more  than  three  years  after  the  filing  deadline  on  April  21,  2015.
Applicant filed automatic extensions for several tax years, but did not meet the October
15 deadlines. (GX 2; Tr. 40-43; Answer.)
Applicant  filed  an  extension  for  his  2017  Federal  tax  return,  which  moved  his
deadline  to  October  15,  2018.  However,  Applicant’s  accounting  and  tax  preparation
resulted  in Applicant’s  owing  Federal  tax  for  2017.  He  was  required  by  Federal  law  to
submit his payment by the April 2018 filing deadline. On May 31, 2018, Applicant filed the
return with a check for $2,500 for tax payment. (AX A.) Further, this submission occurred
one week after Applicant acknowledged receipt of the Notice of Hearing.3 Regarding his
2017 return, Applicant stated:
It is interesting that my 2017 "Application for Automatic Extension of Time
to File" projects us receiving a $300 refund while my actual tax filing shows
us owing additional taxes. In other words, we made yet another mistake. It
is a humbling lesson learned for me going forward that estimates (just like
2014) can be wrong. (AX B.)
1  The  relevant  pages  from  2011  1040  instructions  from  www.irs.gov  are  appended  to  the  record  as  Administrative
Exhibit (AD EX) IV.
2 See www.irs.gov.
3 The email acknowledging receipt of the Notice of Hearing is appended to the file as AD EX II. Appellant’s sheet of
corrections of the transcript is amended to the file as AD EX III.
It is unclear when Applicant realized he was required to file by the IRS deadlines
regardless of whether or not he was entitled to a refund, but it was at some point prior to
filing his Answer on November 30, 2017. However, Applicant also stated in his Answer
that his “previous security investigations revealed this same issue since [his] wife’s wreck
in 2001 and since the start of [his] business in 2008.” Upon receiving the SOR, he realized
that his practice of delinquently filing his tax returns could have a negative impact on his
security clearance. (Tr. 67-70.)
Applicant  does  not  owe  any  balance  for  his  2014  state  tax.  However,  as  of
September  28,  2017,  Applicant  had  not  filed  his  2015  and  2016  state  tax  returns.
(Answer.) Applicant filed his 2017 state tax return on May 31, 2018. (AX A.)
Applicant thinks filing his tax returns will be simplified now that he no longer has to
wait for a Schedule K-1 or incorporate the information from it into his tax calculations, but
instead  receives  a standard  employee W-2. (Tr. 66.)  Applicant  stated that because  he
was operating under the misconception that he had three years to file if he was owed a
refund from the IRS, he did not think he was violating any laws. (Tr. 70.) Applicant stated
several times that he remains circumspect about hiring a tax preparer or accountant out
of concern that Applicant’s personal information will be hacked. His current intention is to
continue  preparing  his  own  tax  returns.  (Tr.  64-73.)  Applicant  does  not  have  any
delinquent accounts or other financial issues. (AX C-AX H.) Now that Applicant is aware
of the negative impact his delinquent filing of his Federal and state tax returns could have
on his security eligibility, he intends to timely file all future tax returns. (Tr. 70-71.)
Applicant’s witness, a security specialist who has worked with Applicant for more
than  11  years,  holds  a  security  clearance.  She  is  aware  of  the  SOR  allegations.  She
testified that Applicant is trustworthy and reliable, stating that he has identified and helped
to  rectify  several data spillages  that  were  potentially  damaging,  and that  he has never
caused a security-related incident. (Tr. 28-31.) Applicant provided character references
from his supervisor since 2003, a friend of over 30 years, a coworker since 2008, and a
former  coworker  and  friend  of  28  years.  Each  is  aware  of  the  SOR  allegations.
Collectively,  they  stated  that  Applicant  is  a  person  of  integrity  who  is  skilled  in  his
profession.  Given  Applicant’s  character  and  trustworthiness,  they  highly  recommend
Applicant for continued access to classified information. (Answer.)
