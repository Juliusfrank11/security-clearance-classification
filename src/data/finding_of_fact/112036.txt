Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d-1.f, 3.a-3.m, and he denied
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 2.a. He is 29 years old, single, and he has one child, a minor.3
Applicant graduated from high school in 2007. He earned a bachelor’s degree in
2011 and a master’s degree in 2015. As of the date of the hearing, he was enrolling to
earn  a  second  master’s  degree.  He  worked  for  previous  DOD  contractors  from
approximately  2015  to  2017.  He  received  an  offer  of  employment  from  a  DOD
contractor  in  September  2018,  contingent  on  obtaining  a  security  clearance.  He  has
never held a clearance, and his interim clearance from November 2016 was suspended
after the issuance of the SOR.4
In  September  2012,  Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  with  a  suspended
license;  he  denied  that  he  was  arrested  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  2.a).  He  was  pulled  over  by  a
police  officer  for  driving  with  a  suspended  license,  which  stemmed  from  an  unpaid
traffic-related  ticket.  As  instructed  by  the  officer,  he  left  his  car  parked  and  a  friend

picked  him  up.  He  immediately  called  the  state  motor  vehicle  administration,  paid  the
$100 ticket, and returned to retrieve his car the next day.5
In  May  2014,  Applicant  was  charged  with  negligent  driving  in  a  careless  and
imprudent  manner,  endangering  property,  life,  and  person,  and  driving  under  the
influence  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  1.c,  2.a).  He  was  on  a  date  with  his  child’s  mother  at  a  sushi
restaurant.  He  drank  sake  for  the  first  time.  He  did  not  feel  intoxicated  so  he  drove
home.  As  he  approached  his  home,  the  road  that  he  lived  on  was  flooded.  He
unknowingly  drove  his  car  on  top  of  a  submerged  tree,  then  called  the  police  for
assistance. The responding officer asked him if he had been drinking, and he said “Yes”
and  disclosed  that  he  had  consumed  a  “couple  of  sak[e]s.”  The  officer  looked  into  his
eyes  with  a  flashlight  and  administered  a  walk-and-turn  sobriety  test.  The  officer  then
placed him in the front seat of the officer’s car, without handcuffs, and drove him to the
precinct.  There,  he  was  administered  a  breathalyzer  test  and  tested  under  the  legal
limit.  He  received  18  months  of  probation  before  judgment,  a  $140  fine,  and  he  was
ordered to attend alcohol-education counseling. He completed probation, paid the fine,
and attended alcohol counseling; he did not receive an alcohol-related diagnosis. (SOR
¶¶ 1.c, 2.a).6
In  July  2015,  Applicant  was  charged  with  second-degree  assault  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d,
2.a).  This was  his  first  domestic-violence-related  charge.  He  was  living  with  his  child’s
mother and they got into a verbal argument. She called the police and reported that he
hit her on her leg, which he denied. The case was placed on a stet docket. In August
2015,  the  case  was  taken  out  of  the  stet  docket  when  he  was  again  charged  with
second-degree assault (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 2.a). He testified that he and his child’s mother got
into  another  argument,  after  she  hit  him  on  his  head  with  a  remote.  He  denied  hitting
her.  He  stated  that  “She  was  coming  at  me  in  an  aggressive  way,”  so  he  threw  her
purse  at  her,  and  the  buckle  of  the  purse  scratched  her  forehead  and  caused  her  to
bleed. When the police arrived, they immediately arrested him upon seeing the blood on
her  forehead.  At  trial,  his  child’s  mother  admitted  that  she  lied  about  the  July  incident
and  he  was  consequently  found  not  guilty  of  that  charge.  He  received  24  months  of
probation  before  judgment  for  the  August  charge,  and  he  was  ordered  to  attend
domestic-violence counseling. He completed counseling in 2016 and probation in 2017.
He has since returned to the counseling program on invitation to share his experiences
with other attendees.7
In  June  2018,  Applicant  was  charged  with  second-degree  assault  for  the  third
time  (SOR  ¶¶  1.f,  2.a).  He  testified  that  he  told  his  child’s  mother  that  he  no  longer
wanted her living with him. He then went to his weekly church group and returned to a
vandalized  home.  He  told  her  to  take  what  she  wanted  but  leave  their  son  with  him,
since he was the sole breadwinner. He grabbed her keys and got into a tug-of-war with
her over her cell phone, which he wanted to keep because he paid for it. When he let go

of the phone, he fell backwards onto the floor, and as he was standing up, she said “you
just  hit  me,  I’m  calling  the  police.”  He  gathered  his  belongings  and  went  to  a  friend’s
house  to  spend  the  night.  In  the  morning,  he  reported  to  the  police  station  to  try  to
provide his statement to any report that she might have filed the previous night. He was
given the name and number of the reporting officer, because the officer was not at the
station, and he left the officer a voicemail. He returned to the station when the officer did
not return his call, and another officer was sent to his home later that day. That officer
told  him  that  there  was  no  police  report  filed  and  he  was  not  charged.  He  was  thus
surprised  when  he  received  a  court  summons  reflecting  that  he  had,  in  fact,  been
charged with second-degree assault. His child’s mother claimed in a police report that
he  hit  her  and  placed  her  in  a  headlock.  He  hired  an  attorney  and  intends  to  fight  the
charge. The case was scheduled for a pre-trial hearing in December 2018.8
Applicant testified that the relationship between him and his child’s mother ended
in December 2017. As her name is still on the lease, she has continued to reside in their
home approximately two to three days out of the week. He unsuccessfully attempted to
remove  her  name  from  the  lease.  He  has  known  her  since  elementary  school.  They
dated  briefly  in  high  school  but  fell  out  of  touch  when  their  families  moved.  They
reconnected and began dating again in May 2014. He testified that he did not take the
time to get to know her, and he learned throughout the course of their relationship that
she  has  a  criminal  background,  to  include  domestic-violence-related  charges  from
previous relationships. He also learned that “the way that she communicates is through
violence. And she’s clever. I have to give that to her because she calls the police.” He
testified that he never initiated any violence, as he is not a violent person. He has not
brought  domestic-violence-related  charges  against  her  because  she  is  his  child’s
mother and does not want her to get into trouble.9
In  the  future,  Applicant  intends  to  be  more  pragmatic  in  how  he  assesses  and
responds  to  situations  involving  his  child’s  mother,  and  to  call  the  police  if  necessary.
He  no  longer  intends  to  protect  her  at  his  expense.  He  does  not  have  any  other
criminal-related  incidents.  He  testified  that  his  employer  was  aware  of  his  2014  and
2015  charges,  but  he  had  not  yet  reported  his  2018  charge.  While  he  was  concerned
about the impact on his employment that the outcome of his 2018 charge would have,
he was not concerned about his employer finding out about it.10
The SOR also alleges the following delinquent accounts: a medical debt of $478
(SOR ¶ 3.a); eight student loans totaling $118,656 (SOR ¶¶ 3.b-3.i); and four consumer
accounts totaling $1,602 (SOR ¶¶ 3.j-3.m). The debts are established by a 2018 credit
bureau  report.  Applicant  also  disclosed  his  debts  in  his  2015  security  clearance
application (SCA).11

Applicant  attributed  his  delinquent  debts  to  being  the  primary  provider  from
approximately  2014  to  2018  for  his  child,  his  child’s  mother,  and  her  10-year-old  child
from a previous relationship. He was also involved in a no-fault car accident in which his
car  was  totaled.  He  received  $4,000  from  the  accident,  but  he  had  to  apply  it towards
the  expense  of  obtaining  another  car.  He  attributed  his  minor  medical  debt  to  his
involuntary termination.12
SOR ¶ 3.a is for a $478 medical debt. Applicant testified that he believed he had
health  insurance  after  his  involuntary  termination  from  a  previous  employer.  He
indicated  that  he  did  not  receive  a  bill  for  his  visit  to  an  urgent  care  center  for  strep
throat, and he was unaware of this debt until he received the SOR. He researched the
debt and intended to resolve it with his tax refund.13
SOR ¶¶ 3.b through 3.i are for Applicant’s eight defaulted student loans from his
bachelor’s  degree,  totaling  approximately  $118,656.  He  testified  that  he  first  learned
that  his  loans  were  in  default  when  he  began  working  with  the  credit-repair  company
Lexington  Law  in  May  2018  to  resolve  his  delinquent  accounts,  as  he  did  not  receive
any  delinquent  notices.  He  contacted  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education  after  he
received  the  amended  SOR  in  November  2018,  and  he  set  up  an  income-based
payment  plan  of  $5  monthly  for  nine  months  to  get  his  loans  out  of  default.  As  of  the
date  of  the  hearing,  he  paid  a  total  of  $10  towards  that  plan;  he  also  made  a  $10
payment in December 2018. He intended to continue to abide by the payment plan, and
once  his  loans  were  out  of  default,  he  intended  to  make  timely  monthly  payments
towards his student loans.14
SOR  ¶¶  3.j  and  3.k  are  for  two  credit  cards  in  collection  for  a  total  of  $827.
Applicant  testified  that  he  cosigned  the  credit  cards  for  his  child’s  mother  in
approximately 2015. He intended to resolve them with his tax refund.15
SOR ¶ 3.l is for a charged-off credit-card account for $238. Applicant testified that
he was a victim of identity theft or hacking, so he closed his account with the creditor in
2015. He testified that he is a claimant to a pending federal lawsuit against the creditor,
and he believed the account would be resolved through the lawsuit. He testified that he
disputed  the  debt  through  Lexington  Law.  Since  he  canceled  his  subscription  with
Lexington Law, he intended to dispute the debt directly with the credit bureaus.16

SOR ¶  3.m  is  for  another  charged-off  credit-card  account  for  $537.  Applicant
testified  that  this  debt  is  for  his  credit  card,  which  he  forgot  about.  He  intended  to
resolve it with his tax refund.17
As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  worked  as  a  financial  analyst  for  his
current employer. He was promoted in October 2018. His annual income was $61,200.
He  testified  that  he  received  financial  counseling  from  three  credit-repair  companies,
Credit Karma in 2016, and Credit Sesame and Lexington Law in 2018. He canceled his
subscription  to  Lexington  Law  because  he  did  not  find  them  helpful;  however,  he  was
continuing  to  monitor  his  credit  through  Credit  Sesame.  He  has  also  received  budget
training at work, and he has a budget. He is current on his rent of $1,225 monthly and
his car payment of $360 monthly. He continues to be primarily responsible for his child’s
expenses,  as  his  child’s  mother  does  not  contribute.  After  expenses,  his  monthly  net
remainder is approximately $500. He has a savings account with a balance of $140. He
has  a  retirement  account  with  an  unknown  balance.  He  testified  that  “I’m  just  now
starting to really take control of my finances,” whereas in the past five years, he focused
on his immediate, day-to-day expenses.18
Applicant’s  previous  supervisor  described  Applicant  as  an  “exceptional  member
of our team,” and stated that he had “full confidence in [Applicant’s] ability to maintain [a
security  clearance].”  Applicant’s  pastor  of  ten  years  described  Applicant  as  a  highly
professional and trustworthy individual. A friend of ten years described Applicant to be
an “upstanding, centered, and skilled gentleman.”19
