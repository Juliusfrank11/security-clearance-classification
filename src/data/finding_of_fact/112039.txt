Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations.  He  is  a  58-year-old  industrial  security
specialist  employed  by  a  U.S.  defense  contractor  since  June  2016.  He  has  been
employed in related positions since February 1999, with periods of unemployment from
January-June  2011  and  January-June  2016.  He  has  previously  had  favorable
background investigations in June 2002 and July 2009. This is a periodic reinvestigation
of that clearance (GE 1).
The  SOR  alleges,  Government  exhibits  substantiate,  and  Applicant  admits  six
delinquent  debts  totaling  over  $122,000.  The  debts  comprise  a  $20,619  Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) tax lien filed in May 2010,  and five delinquent education loans
totaling  $101,629.  Applicant  obtained  the  education  loans  to  pay  for  his  children’s
college expenses. Applicant disclosed the fact, but not the amount, of the tax lien on his
August 2014 clearance application (GE 1). He did not disclose any delinquent education
loans on his clearance application, but discussed them with a Government investigator
during a February 2015 interview (GE 2) based on an August 2014 credit report (GE 4).
Applicant’s July 2016 credit report (GE 3) reflects the education loan amounts alleged in
the  SOR.  Applicant’s  January  2017  Answer  contains  a  December  2016  loan  account
statement showing a $103,546 combined principal balance.  4
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  being  laid  off  in  January  2011.  At
the time, he was making $145,000-150,000 annually, and was generally not having any
problems keeping up with his financial obligations. He received an unstated amount of
severance  pay  (GE  2).  He  was  unemployed  until  June  2016,  when  he  obtained
employment  paying  $125,000  annually.  In  January  2012,  he  obtained  a  different  job,
earning $128,000  annually. In  January  2016,  he  resigned  that  position,  and  remained
unemployed until June 2016, when he obtained his current position, earning $124,000
annually (Tr. 41).
Applicant did not explain why he had Federal income tax liens filed against him in
2010, only that his January 2011 layoff made it difficult for him to keep up his payment
plan,  which  he  otherwise  did  not  document.  Similarly,  during  his  February  2015
interview, he claimed to have just arranged a repayment plan on his education loans, to
pay $120 monthly. He could not recall the start or payoff dates for his repayment plan
(GE  2).  At  hearing,  he  claimed,  without  corroboration  to  be  paying  $1,000  monthly
through direct withdrawal for about the last six months (Tr. 35-36).
Applicant had two other tax liens filed in 2010, which were satisfied (GE 4). Also not alleged in the SOR,
Applicant had state tax garnishments issued against him in March and July 2013, which were satisfied. He
had a June 2014 garnishment order for $91,464.12 in delinquent education loans. In June 2014, he had a
$27,826 IRS levy for tax years 2005-2007 (GE 2). Applicant provided no independent documentation of his
current tax status.
The account statement showed no past-due amounts. The $1,100 January monthly payment included unpaid
fees, not otherwise specified.
Applicant  documented  no  credit  or  financial  counseling,  and  did  not  submit  a
budget.  He  provided  no  work  or  character  references,  or  evidence  of  community
involvement.
