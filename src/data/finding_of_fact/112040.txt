In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with limited comments, nearly all of
the factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through
1.d., and 1.f.); he failed to admit or deny one allegation pertaining to personal conduct
(SOR  ¶  1.e.),  so a  denial  was  registered for  him;  he  admitted,  with  limited  comments,
nearly all of the factual allegations pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR ¶¶ 2.a. through
2.c.); he failed to admit or deny one allegation pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR ¶ 2.d.),
so  a  denial  was  registered  for  him;  and  he  admitted  several  allegations  pertaining  to
financial considerations (SOR ¶¶ 3.i. through 3.n.). He denied, with limited comments, all
of the remaining allegations.
During  the  hearing,  Department  Counsel  moved  to  amend  the  SOR  by  adding
eight  additional  factual  allegations  pertaining  to  financial  considerations  (SOR  ¶¶  3.o.
1 Effective June 8, 2017, by Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), dated December
10, 2016, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) for all covered individuals who require initial or
continued  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  or  eligibility  to  hold  a  sensitive  position,  were
established  to  supersede  all  previously  issued  national  security  adjudicative  criteria  or  guidelines.
Accordingly,  those  guidelines  previously  implemented  on  September  1,  2006,  under  which  this  security
clearance review case was initiated, no longer apply. In comparing the two versions, there is no substantial
difference that might have a negative effect on Applicant in this case.
2 Although the pre-printed form upon which Applicant selected the chosen forum was dated 2016,
it is clear that if the SOR was issued in December 2016, he could not have received it in January 2016.
3 Although a copy of the purported transcript was received on October 2, 2018, while the cover of
the  transcript  was  the  one  for  this  case,  the  contents  were  associated  with  a  different  case.  Upon
determining the error, the correct transcript was electronically transmitted to me on January 17, 2019.
through 3.v.). There being no objection, the motion was granted.4 Applicant was afforded
20 days to respond to the new allegations. He failed to admit or deny any of the added
allegations pertaining to financial considerations, so denials were registered for him.
Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact.
After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the  evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  a  missile  assembler  with  his  current  employer  since  October  2004.  Although  he
attended high school for six years, in 2000, he received a certificate of completion, but
not  a  diploma.  He  has  never  served  in  the  U.S.  military.  He  was  granted  a  secret
clearance in 2004. Applicant has never married, but he has resided with a cohabitant for
an  unspecified  period,  and  he  had  four  children,  born  in  2002,  2004,  2008,  and  2015,
respectively.
Personal Conduct and Criminal Conduct
Applicant has a lengthy history of disregarding laws, rules, and regulations. The
SOR alleged nine incidents of criminality and personal conduct by Applicant commencing
in 2006, and continuing until at least 2016.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 3.n.): In June 2006, Applicant was charged with 1) Driving with
Suspended License, 2) Operating a Vehicle without Insurance, and 3) Switched Tag. He
was convicted and fined.5 He was granted a payment plan. While he paid $35 associated
with the Switched Tag conviction, he failed to pay the remaining $256 for that charge, and
the $306 and $356 for the other charges.6
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b. and 3.n.): In July 2012, Applicant was charged with 1) Driving while
License  Suspended,  and  2)  Operating  a  Vehicle  without  Insurance.  He  was  convicted
and fined.7 He was granted a payment plan. While he paid $356 for the Insurance charge,
and  $244  associated  with  the  Suspended  License  conviction,  he  failed  to  pay  the
remaining $62 for that charge.8
(SOR ¶¶ 1.c. and 3.n.): In July 2013, Applicant was charged with 1) Driving with
License Revoked, 2) Operating a Vehicle without Insurance, and 3) Expired Tag. He was

convicted and fined.9 He was granted a payment plan. His fines of $306 for the Revoked
License, $356 for the Insurance, and $206 for the Expired Tag remain unpaid.10
(SOR ¶¶ 2.a. and 3.n.): In October 2013, Applicant was charged with Contempt of
Court associated with his failures to pay his outstanding fines. In March 2014, after he
paid $35 in fees and court costs, the charge was nolle prossed.11
(SOR ¶¶ 1.d., 1.f., and 3.n.): In January 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged
with  1)  Driving  with  License  Revoked,  2)  Failure/Refusal  to  Display  Insurance,  and
Expired Tag. He was convicted and fined.12 He was granted a payment plan. His $306
fine  for  Revoked  License,  $356  fine  for  Insurance,  and  his  $206  fine  for  Expired  Tag
remain unpaid.13 Applicant failed to self-report his arrest to his security manager of facility
security office.14
(SOR  ¶¶  2.b.  and  3.n.):  In  September  2014,  Applicant  was  again  charged  with
Contempt of Court associated with his failures to pay his outstanding fines. In November
2014, a warrant was issued for his arrest. He was eventually ordered to pay $303 in fees
and court costs, but that amount remains unpaid.15
(SOR ¶ 1.g.): In December 2015, a coworker brought a shocking pen into the work
area. Applicant took the device from the coworker and entered another work area where
he attempted to “prank” another employee. Human Resources determined that Applicant
had conspired to be untruthful in an interview when he was questioned about his level of
involvement  in  the  incident.  Applicant  was  subsequently  issued  a  written  warning  for
failure  to  comply  with  the  company’s  guidelines  for  professional  conduct.16  Applicant
denied both the allegation and taking the device into the work area, claiming the incident
was incorrectly reported.17
(SOR  ¶  2.c.):  Although  he  is  aware  that  it  is  illegal  to  operate  a  motor  vehicle
without a driver’s license, when he is unable to obtain transportation to and from work

with a coworker, to avoid being fired from his job,  Applicant admitted that he takes the
risk and has continued to drive unlawfully since his 2014 arrest.18
Financial Considerations19
Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to several factors: he is a single father;
he and his children reside with Applicant’s grandmother – the individual who raised him
– in her house; his girlfriend refused to allow him to get a tag for the vehicle in her name
for which he had cosigned; and in 2012, his girlfriend left him and the children. Although
not cited by him as a contributing factor to his financial problems, three or four years ago,
for Christmas, Applicant purchased an unspecified number of all-terrain-vehicles (ATVs)
for his children, each costing $5,000 to $6,000.20 For reasons not explained other than
experiencing “rough times,” in addition to the traffic fines and fees that remain unpaid,
other accounts became delinquent.
The SOR, as amended, identified 21 purportedly delinquent accounts, including
unpaid court fines and fees, which had been placed for collection, charged off, or filed as
judgments,  as  generally  reflected  by  Applicant’s  December  2010,  June  2016,  or
September  2018  credit  reports.  Those  debts  total  approximately  $48,677.  The  current
status of the non-court fines and fees accounts is as follows:
There  are  six  delinquent  accounts  that  were  placed  for  collection  and  filed  as
judgments that were eventually partially or fully satisfied by garnishments: $5,028 (SOR
¶¶ 3.c. and 3.l.); $1,048 (SOR ¶ 3.d.); $1,400 (SOR ¶¶ 3.e. and 3.m.); $1,025 (SOR ¶
3.f.); $5,064 (SOR ¶¶ 3.g. and 3.i.); and $1,149 (SOR ¶ 3.h.).21 There has been no change
in  the  status of  a  vast  majority  of  Applicant’s  accounts  that  were  placed for collection,
most of which were charged off with unpaid balances: $4,787 (SOR ¶ 3.a.); $374 (SOR
¶ 3.b.); $2,167 (SOR ¶ 3.o.); $1,385 (SOR ¶ 3.p.); $2,088 (SOR ¶ 3.q.); $9,073 (SOR ¶
3.r.); $6,154 (SOR ¶ 3.s.); $418 (SOR ¶ 3.t.); $175 (SOR ¶ 3.u.); and $714 (SOR ¶ 3.v.).22

Applicant claimed he made some payments to creditors, and he contended that in
March 2018 he engaged the professional services of a debt relief organization to resolve
his  delinquent  accounts,  and  that  he  pays  that  organization  $400  per  month  for  their
services.23 Although Applicant stated an intention to submit documentation regarding his
relationship  with  the  debt  relief  company;  the  status  of  all  of  his  delinquent  accounts;
payment plans established with his creditors; and payments made to creditors by himself
or in his behalf, no such documentation was submitted.
Applicant  submitted  a  Personal  Financial  Statement  to  reflect  his  monthly  net
income; monthly expenses; and a monthly remainder available for discretionary saving or
spending. He reported that his monthly net salary was about $2,731.80, and his monthly
expenses,  including  $500  child  support,  and  $600 for debt  relief and  credit  cards,  was
$2,450.24  That  leaves  him  approximately  $282  per  month  available  for  discretionary
saving or spending. There is no evidence of financial counseling.
