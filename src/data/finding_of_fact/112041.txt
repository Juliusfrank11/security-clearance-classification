The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of November 20, 2017, Applicant owed
delinquent debt totaling $44,184 on nine accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.i). In response to the
SOR allegations, Applicant admitted three consumer credit debts of $15,449 (SOR ¶ 1.c),
$4,743 (SOR ¶ 1.d), and $6,126 (SOR ¶ 1.e). He denied owing a $131 satellite-television
debt (SOR ¶ 1.a), a $1,323 medical debt in collection (SOR ¶ 1.b), a $765 charged-off
balance (SOR ¶ 1.f), a delinquent mortgage past due for $13,748 (SOR ¶ 1.g), a $1,183
utility debt in collection (SOR ¶ 1.h), and a $666 collection debt (SOR ¶ 1.i).
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 55-year-old extrusion engineer with a general equivalency diploma.
He  has  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  since  July  2015.  He  testified  that  he  held  a
clearance that was withdrawn, but he does not know the level. (Tr. 34-35.) He was married
to his first wife from August 1991 to October 2009, and has a 21-year-old son from that
union.  He  has  a  37-year-old  daughter  from  a  previous  relationship.  Applicant  and  his
current spouse began cohabiting in September 2011. They married in September 2018.
(GE 1; AE A; Tr. 30.)
Applicant  worked  as  a  vice  president  of  sales  for  his  brother’s  company  from
October 1994 to July 2009. In July 2009, he left his job paying him $90,000 annually to
start his own extrusion business in another part of their state. The expectation was that his
brother would refer business to him. (GE 1; Tr. 37-38, 41-42.) In October 2009, Applicant
purchased a home in his new area. He made a down payment of $25,000 and obtained a
mortgage loan of $144,000 (SOR ¶ 1.g) to be repaid at $1,302 monthly. (GEs 1-4; Tr. 63-
64.) In December 2009, he charged $1,088 on a jewelry store account for earrings (not
alleged in SOR). In October 2010, he bought a snowmobile, obtaining a loan for $11,264,
to be repaid at $228 per month (SOR ¶ 1.d). In December 2011, he bought a car with a
loan of $16,439 (not alleged in SOR). Applicant relied on credit cards obtained in August
1987 (SOR ¶ 1.c) and January 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.e) for household needs. (GEs 2-4; AE A; Tr.
47.)
Applicant’s income from his business was about $40,000 a year at first.  It never
exceeded $100,000. He incurred unexpected expenses in renting a building that did not
have adequate electrical voltage to run the equipment needed for his business. (Tr. 38-40.)
He had to buy a transformer that cost $25,000, which was delayed in its delivery. It put his
business behind at the start. (Tr. 38-40.) Then Applicant’s brother stopped sending him
business.  Applicant’s  income  dropped  to  $10,000,  and  he  began  to  default  on  some
financial obligations. (Tr. 65-66.)
Applicant made no payments after February 2012 on the snowmobile (SOR ¶ 1.d),
and the recreational vehicle was subsequently repossessed. The deficiency balance on his
loan was charged off for $4,743 and placed for collection in November 2012. (Tr. 56.) His
credit-card account in SOR ¶ 1.c became seriously delinquent in October 2012 and was
charged off for $15,000. He had a second account with the creditor opened in September
1987 with a high credit of $254 that had been closed due to inactivity in September 2012.
He made a last payment on his credit card in SOR ¶ 1.e in March 2012, and the creditor
charged off his account for $6,126 in May 2012. Applicant stopped paying on his jewelry
debt in early 2013, and his account was charged off for $733 in approximately July 2013.
(GEs 1-4.)
In early 2013, Applicant’s business lost its biggest customer. (Tr. 25-26, 40.) Around
February 2013, Applicant had a heart attack.1 He incurred a $1,323 ambulance charge that
he did not repay. He was not held responsible for repayment of his other medical bills
because his income was minimal. (Tr. 49.)
1  Applicant  testified  that  he  had  a  heart  attack  in  2014,  shortly  before  he  went  to  work  for  the  trucking
company. (Tr. 49-50.) Available credit reports show that the medical bill at issue is from February 2013. (GEs
2-3.)  According  to  his  SF  86,  he  began  working  for  the  trucking  company  in  2013.  (GE  1.)  His  present
recollection of the 2014 date appears to be inaccurate. (Tr. 81.)
In July 2013, Applicant closed his business. He used his retirement savings to pay
his  business  creditors.  (Tr.  68.)  He  paid  off  a  personally-guaranteed  business  loan  of
$77,090 in September 2013. (GE 3.) He made no payments toward his mortgage loan
(SOR ¶ 1.g) after July 2013, however, and he vacated the property in September 2013. As
of  April  2014,  his  loan  was  $13,748  past  due  on  a  balance  of  $136,203.  (GEs  1-4.)
Applicant testified that he was told when he vacated the property “that would be fine.” He
had about $20,000 in equity in the property. (Tr. 27, 69-71.)
From  July  2013  to  June  2015,  Applicant  worked  as  a  truck  driver  earning
approximately  $50,000  annually.  (GE  1;  Tr.  26,  36.)  In  October  2013,  his  car  was
repossessed, and his account was charged off. (GEs 1-4.). He borrowed $20,000 from his
brother to purchase a used car. According to Applicant, his brother does not expect to be
repaid. (Tr. 78-79.) A satellite-television debt of $131 from January 2015 was charged off
and then placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.a). A credit-card account opened in May 2015
became delinquent in July 2015, and a $696 debt was charged off and placed for collection
(SOR ¶ 1.i). (GEs 1-4.)
In  July  2015,  Applicant  began  working  for  his  defense-contractor  employer.  On
August  31,  2015,  he  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a  Questionnaire  for
National  Security  Positions  (SF  86).  In  response  to  financial  inquiries  regarding  any
delinquency on routine accounts, he indicated that he owed past-due credit-card debts of
$6,126  (SOR  1.e),  $15,449  (SOR  ¶  1.c),  and  $733  for  jewelry  (not  alleged  in  SOR).
Applicant indicated that he owed nothing on his defaulted snowmobile, car, and home
loans. Concerning his defaulted mortgage loan, he indicated that his loan was resolved in
April  2014,  when  he  returned  the  keys  to  the  property  (SOR  ¶  1.g).  He  attributed  his
financial delinquencies to his business loss and expressed his intention to repay his credit-
card debts. He also related that he was discussing possible options with an attorney about
the  credit-card  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.c.  (GE  1.)  At  his  hearing,  he  elaborated  that  he  had
discussed filing for bankruptcy with an attorney, but he felt at the time that he would get a
chance to repay his creditors. (Tr. 48.)
A check of Applicant’s credit on September 5, 2015, revealed that his $15,449 and
$6,126 credit-card debts, his $4,743 snowmobile loan balance, and his $1,323 medical
debt  from  February  2013  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  were  in  collection.  His  defaulted  mortgage  was
$13,748 past due as of April 2014. A credit card was past due 30 days for $50 on a $468
balance  (SOR  ¶  1.i).  Applicant  was  making  timely  payments  on  two  credit  cards  with
balances of $4,088 with creditor X and $584 with creditor Y. (GE 2.)
On October 6, 2015, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  When  asked  about  his delinquent  accounts,
Applicant admitted that he owed the $15,449 and $6,126 credit-card debts. He asserted
that he owed nothing on the defaulted jewelry account, snowmobile loan, or mortgage loan.
When  confronted  about  the  $1,323  medical  debt,  Applicant  indicated  that  it  was  an
ambulance  bill  that  he  was  disputing  because  the  ambulance  broke  down  while
transporting him to the hospital. As for the credit card that was past due for $50 (SOR ¶
1.i), Applicant explained that he was having trouble contacting the creditor to repay the
debt. He expressed a plan to start making monthly payments toward his delinquencies by
January  2016,  and  to  attempt  to  verify  his  disputed  debts.  He  described  his  financial
situation as stable and catching up. (AE A.)
In  February  2016,  the  credit-card  account  that  had  been  past  due  for  $50  was
placed for collection for $696 with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.i. In April 2016, a utility provider
placed a $1,183 debt for collection (SOR ¶ 1.h). (GE 3.) Applicant claims that the debt was
incurred  by  subsequent  tenants  after  he  moved  out  of  the  apartment  (Tr.  71),  but  he
submitted no proof, and it is on his credit report. In April 2016, Applicant opened a credit-
card account, which had a current balance of $535 as of July 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.f). As of
August  2016,  Applicant  was  making  timely  payments  to  creditor  X  toward  a  $3,376
balance. (GE 3.)
As  of  November  15,  2017,  Equifax  reported  no  progress  toward  resolving  the
delinquencies in the SOR. Applicant’s foreclosed mortgage loan was listed as $13,748 past
due as of April 2014 with no recent update. The balance on the defaulted snowmobile loan
(SOR ¶ 1.d) had accrued to $7,488. The $131 satellite-television debt (SOR ¶ 1.a) had
been placed for collection in March 2017, and was listed as unpaid as of November 5,
2017, although Applicant testified at his hearing that he paid the debt by check “a couple of
years ago.” (Tr. 43.) His account with creditor X was current with a $3,293 balance. The
account has a credit limit of $3,300. (GE 4.) As of August 2015, his credit limit on the
account was $4,000. (GE 2.)
At his hearing, Applicant testified about the delay in addressing his past-due debts
that “things are just coming up in my life that are out of my control, and you know, take
precedence  over  paying  debts  off.”  (Tr.  25.)  He  had  a  motorcycle  accident  while  on
vacation visiting his brother in February 2018, and he was out of work on disability for
about eight months. (Tr. 25, 28, 74-75.) His disability income was “basically the same” as
his employment income, but it was paid out in lump sums. (Tr. 28.) His friends raised about
three months’ rent for him when he was in the hospital being treated for a traumatic brain
injury following his accident. (Tr. 29.)
On March 13, 2019, Applicant stated that the credit-card account in SOR ¶ 1.c and
the defaulted mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.g) were being removed from his credit report. (AE B.) A
record  from  the  creditor  (AE  D)  indicates  that  it  could  not  verify  an  account  ending  in
x36423. (AE D.) That account number matches that of the account that was closed in 2012
due to inactivity and not the account ending in x23183, on which Applicant owes a $15,449
balance. Applicant admitted that he has paid nothing on the credit-card debt in SOR ¶ 1.c,
but  he  is  not  receiving  any  collection  notices.  (Tr.  47,  55.)  Concerning  the  defaulted
mortgage, documentation from the creditor indicates only that Applicant was provided with
the company’s credit retraction fax number so that they could attempt to resolve his inquiry.
(AE E.) Applicant testified that the debt should no longer be on his credit report because
the  house  was  sold  for  more  than  what  he  paid  for  it.  (Tr.  77.)  Applicant  presented
documentation  showing  that  his  spouse  had  delinquent  cellphone  (AE  F)  and  cable
television  (AE  G)  accounts  that  were  settled  in  November  2017.  On  March  11,  2019,
Applicant made a $1,000 payment to creditor X. (AE C.)
Applicant indicates that he had an agreement with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.e to settle
his $6,126 debt for $3,500. (AE B.) At his hearing, he testified that, a few months ago, he
was told he could settle the debt for $3,000, and he told the creditor that he would respond
when he had the money to settle it. (Tr. 57.) Applicant asserts that he had reached out to
the  creditor  in  SOR  ¶  1.d  but  had  no  payment  plan  in  place  to  address  his  defaulted
snowmobile loan; that he paid $131 to resolve the satellite-television debt (SOR ¶ 1.a); that
the utility provider in SOR ¶ 1.h was still trying to locate his account; and that he was still
trying to connect with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.f about that credit-card debt that he now
believes has not been paid. Applicant added that it was going to take some time to address
his debts, but that he is “on top of it.” (AE B.) Applicant understands that he has to repay
the ambulance debt (SOR ¶ 1.b), but he believes the ambulance company should be held
accountable because the ambulance broke down on the highway when he was having a
heart attack. (Tr. 45-46.) He acknowledges that he has made no payment on the credit-
card debt in collection with the entity in SOR ¶ 1.i. (Tr. 72.)
Applicant’s son currently attends a community college. Applicant cashed in his life
insurance policy of $26,000 to pay his son’s tuition. Applicant gives his son about $100 a
week for his college expenses. (Tr. 32-33.)
Applicant’s current salary with the defense contractor is $75,000. He has earned
bonuses annually of about $2,500. (Tr. 35-36.) He estimates that he owes approximately
$5,000 in medical bills as a result of his accident. He also will have some medical bills for a
procedure  in  January  2019,  although  he  expects  them  to  be  minimal because  he  has
medical insurance. (Tr. 52-54.) He returned to work the day following the procedure. (Tr.
54.) For the most part, he lives from paycheck to paycheck. When he has extra money, he
tries to pay off debts. (Tr. 76.) As of his hearing in February 2019, he had about $9 in his
checking account. (Tr. 79.) His spouse receives about $900 a month in Social Security
Disability income. (Tr. 82.) Applicant and his spouse pay $1,800 per month in rent. (Tr. 83.)
