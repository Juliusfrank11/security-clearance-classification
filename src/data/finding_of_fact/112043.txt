Applicant  is  a  46-year-old  configuration  manager  employed  by  a  U.S.  defense
contractor  since  October  2013.  She  has  served  previously  in  similar  positions  with  a
series of defense contractors since May 1992. She has had small gaps in employment
as  her  currently employer lost  its  bid  on  the  renewal  contract,  only to  have herself  be
hired by the successor contractor. The longest such gap was from December 2005 to
June 2006. She seeks to retain the clearance she was issued in July 2007 (Item 5, 6).
The  SOR  alleges,  and  Government  exhibits  (Items  6-8)  establish,12  delinquent
debts totaling nearly $12,000, and a May 2005 Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition which was
discharged in June 2005. Applicant admitted some debts, and the bankruptcy; claimed
that  some  debts  had  been  included  in  her  bankruptcy;  and  claimed  to  have  been
unaware  of  some  other  debts.  She  listed  no  delinquent  debts  on  her  December  2014
clearance  application  (Item  5),  but  was  confronted  with  them  during  an  April  2015
interview with a Government investigator (Item 6) based on a January 2015 credit report
(Item 7). She similarly failed to disclose a handful of criminal arrests/citations (SOR 2.a-
2.f), but was confronted with them during her interview.3
Applicant documented no efforts to address her debts, either after her interview or
after she received the SOR. She attributed her 2005 bankruptcy filing to her August 1997
divorce, but it is difficult to see this as anything but attenuated. She provided no budget
or financial statement. She has not documented any financial or credit counseling. She
provided no work or character references, or any evidence of community involvement.
