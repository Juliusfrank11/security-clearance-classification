In Applicant’s SOR response, he denied all eight allegations set forth in SOR ¶¶
1.a through 1.h.
Applicant is a 57-year-old licensed attorney. He honorably served in the U.S. Air
Force on active duty from 1986 through 1992. Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in
1985, a master’s degree in 1987, and a juris doctorate in 2003. He is married and has
one adult child. He is sponsored for national security eligibility by a DOD contractor, for
which Applicant is the Chief Executive Officer. (CEO) (Tr. 8-9; GE 1)
Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file state and Federal income tax
returns for multiple years. He owes three state tax debts, three Federal tax debts, and he
has an unsatisfied judgment. The combined total of Applicant’s delinquent indebtedness
is  approximately  $802,288.  The  record  establishes  the  status  of  Applicant’s  unpaid
accounts and untimely tax returns as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant failed to file state and Federal income tax returns for
tax years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2012. He denied this allegation
in his SOR response because he has since filed all of his state and Federal income tax
returns. The testimony and evidence at the hearing showed that Applicant did not timely
file his state and Federal income tax returns for tax years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007,
2008, 2011, and 2012, as required. The income tax returns for tax year 2003 was filed in
2006, and the income tax returns for tax years 2004 through 2008 were filed in 2009. Tax
years 2011 and 2012 income tax returns were filed in May 2014. (Tr. 10 -13, 49, 55, 89-
91)
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, c, and d allege Applicant had two state tax liens entered against him
in  2013,  and  another state  tax  lien  entered against  him  in  2016,  in  the  combined  total
amount of $37,097. Applicant denied these allegations in his response to the SOR. The
testimony and evidence at the hearing showed that Applicant’s state tax liens are unpaid
and unresolved. (Tr. 15, 50, 72)
SOR ¶¶ 1.e, and f allege Applicant had a Federal tax lien entered against him in
2009, and  another  Federal  tax  lien  entered against  him  in  2016,  in  the combined  total
amount of $654,148. Applicant denied these allegations in his response to the SOR. The
testimony  and  evidence  at  the  hearing  showed  that  Applicant’s  Federal  tax  liens  are
unpaid and unresolved. (Tr. 15, 50, 72)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent
2005 income taxes in the amount of $20,225. He denied this allegation in his response to
the  SOR.  The  testimony  and  evidence  at  the  hearing  showed  that  the  Federal
Government  is  currently  claiming  approximately  $860,000  for  Applicant’s  combined
delinquent  Federal  taxes.  Applicant  initiated  a  one-year  repayment  agreement  to  pay
$500 per month to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) four weeks before his hearing. At
the time of his hearing, Applicant had not yet made any payments to the IRS for resolution
of these delinquent taxes. (Tr. 15, 50, 72, 88, 92-93, 95; AE H; AE J)
SOR  ¶ 1.h alleges  Applicant owes  on  a bank  promissory  note  in  the  amount  of
$90,818. The  bank filed  a  lawsuit  against  him  in  October 2014  to collect  this  debt. He
denied  this  allegation  in  his  response  to  the  SOR.  The  testimony  and  evidence  at  the
hearing  showed  that  this  case  is  still  pending  litigation  and  the  debt  is  unresolved.
Applicant believes that he has repaid this debt in full and possibly overpaid the debt, but
he  failed  to  provide  evidence  at  the  hearing  showing  his  history  of  payments  on  this
account. Applicant claimed that he never received any statements from the bank and the
payments on this note were automatically deducted from his bank account for years. He
called his law partner as a witness since she represented Applicant during the litigation
of  the  alleged  promissory  note,  now  valued  at  approximately  $150,000.  (Tr.  39)  She
testified that the lawsuit was pending, and if she filed a motion to dismiss the case, she
believed  it  would  most  likely  be  granted  by  the  court.  As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,
Applicant’s attorney had not filed a motion to dismiss the case, and there was no evidence
presented of Applicant’s claimed payments on this account. This debt is unresolved. (Tr.
20-21, 25-31, 33-35, 40, 77-78; AE A - G)
Applicant stated that his financial problems stem from a catastrophic, million-dollar
loss from a fire that damaged his rental property in 2003. He received a letter from his
insurance  company  the  very  day  the  fire  occurred  advising  him  that  the  insurance
company would no longer insure his rental properties. Applicant suffered a heart attack
shortly thereafter. He was financially ruined, and he borrowed $60,000 from his friends to
survive. Applicant reported that he has repaid all that borrowed money to his friends. (Tr.
10, 92)
Applicant’s office also burned in the fire, and he lost all business records. He did
not timely file state or Federal income tax returns for 2003, but he eventually filed those
income tax returns. He did not file his state and Federal income tax returns for tax year
2004 because he was depressed, and he was on the verge of financial ruin. Applicant
eventually hired a certified public accountant (CPA). The CPA took Applicant’s tax records
and money, and made an appearance on his behalf before the IRS. About a year and a
half later, the CPA kept the money, returned the tax records to Applicant, and told him he
could not help Applicant with his tax issues.  (Tr. 10-11)
Applicant hired a second CPA in about 2005, and he immediately noticed that his
income tax returns were finally being filed. The IRS requested to do an audit of Applicant’s
filed 2009 and 2010 income tax returns. Applicant testified that he and his CPA met with
an IRS representative. The IRS representative had Applicant sign a Power of Attorney
(POA)  for  his  CPA,  and  then  she  advised  him  that  she  would  reschedule  the  audit.
Applicant claimed the IRS representative instructed him not to open his mail from
the IRS because it would only upset him.  He thought that the IRS representative would
send the notices of the audits to Applicant and Applicant’s tax representative(s), the CPA
and eventually Applicant’s sister, who is an IRS enrolled agent and was also added to
Applicant’s POA. (Tr. 11-13, 65-66, 84-85, 90)
After  an  extended  period  of  time, Applicant contacted  his  CPA to determine his
current tax status. The IRS audits for tax years 2009-2010 and 2012-2013 had already
occurred when Applicant learned that the IRS failed to provide any notices of the audits
to his tax representative(s). Applicant admitted that he had received an envelope from the
IRS that contained the audit notice for both of his audits. He did not open any mail from
the  IRS  based  on  the  advice  he  received  from  the  IRS  representative.  Since  no  one
appeared  at  the  hearing  for  Applicant’s  Federal  tax  audits,  all  expenses  reported  on
Applicant’s 2009-2010, and 2012-2013 income tax returns were disallowed by the IRS for
tax write-offs. (Tr. 12-13, 44, 64-70; AE I)
Applicant’s sister, who is a tax expert, testified as a witness. She stated that the
IRS agent’s letter (AE I) pointed out that Applicant’s CPA would not have been provided
a  notice  of  the  tax  audit  since  her  name  was  added  to  the  POA  in  about  2016,  which
essentially cancelled the CPA on the POA. She also stated that, at one point in time, the
CPA and she were both listed on the POA, but in late 2016 Applicant took action to have
the  CPA’s  name  removed  from  the  POA.  She  believed  Applicant’s  two  audits,  for  tax
years 2009-2010 and 2012-2013, took place prior to her name being added on the POA,
so she would not have received any of the audit notices. She did state that Applicant’s
CPA would have received these audit notices prior 2016. (Tr. 53) She testified that her
brother  had  talked  with  his  CPA  about  the  audit  hearings  and  the  CPA  said  he  had  it
handled. The CPA had obviously received the audit notices but he was not appearing at
the audit hearings, as he told her brother.2 (Tr. 58-59, 61) The audit for 2009-2010 tax
years would have most likely taken place in 2011 or 2012, and the audit for 2012-2013
would have most likely taken place in 2014 or 2015. Applicant’s sister filed Applicant’s
2016 and 2017 income tax returns. She stated that her brother owed taxes for both of
those tax years, but he did not pay the Federal taxes owed because he did not have the
funds. (Tr. 62)  She submitted a request for an audit reconsideration in September 2017
but, as of the date of the hearing, the IRS had not yet responded to that request. (Tr. 42-
47, 52-55, 58-63, 72; AE H; AE I)
2 Applicant’s sister’s testimony conflicts with Applicant’s testimony that his CPA did not receive any audit
notices  from  the  IRS.  Applicant  claimed  that  after  the  audits  were  over  and  no  one  appeared,  he  then
received information from the IRS that showed he owed a horrendous amount of Federal taxes for those
audited tax years. He admitted that he received the audit notices from the IRS. Applicant stated that his
sister’s testimony was in error. (Tr. 64-68, 73-74)
Applicant stated that the total amount of Federal and state delinquent taxes were
merely unrealistic numbers due to his disallowed expenses. Applicant wishes to have his
tax issues resolved so he can pay the actual tax money that is owed and be in complete
compliance.  His  most  recent  notice  from  the  IRS  disclosed  that  he  currently  owes
approximately $860,000 for Federal tax liabilities. (Tr. 15, 50, 72) Applicant recently set-
up a one-year repayment plan with the IRS covering tax years 2005, 2008, 2009, 2010,
2012,  2013,  2014,  2015,  2016,  and  2017,  which  includes  all  of  the  tax  years  with
delinquent Federal taxes owed. As of the date of his hearing, he had not yet made any
payments on the one-year repayment plan. He noted that the state tax authority relies on
the Federal Government to determine an individual’s tax liability. Once the Federal tax
numbers are correctly calculated, the state tax authority will then reset his state taxes,
interest, and penalties numbers. He has not yet made any payments on his outstanding
state taxes. (Tr. 13-15, 48-51; 61-62, 71, 76, 87-88; AE H, J)
