arrival in Egypt, he used his Egyptian passport as identification to show that he was an
Egyptian  citizen,  because  it  was  convenient  for  him  to  do  so.  He  relinquished  his
Egyptian  passport  to  his  facility  security  officer  (FSO)  when  he  received  the  SOR  in

SCA  was  approximately  $40,000  USD  (SOR  ¶  2.h).  With  help  from  his  mother  and
siblings,  he  purchased  it  for  approximately  $10,000  USD  from  his  60-year-old  brother,
with the idea that he would use it with his family when he traveled to Egypt. He sold it

Egypt. At the time of his SCA, he also had a bank account in Egypt. He opened it with

Significant  human  rights  problems  in  Egypt  include  excessive  use  of  force  by
security  forces;  deficiencies  in  due  process;  and  the  suppression  of  civil  liberties,
including  societal  and  government  restrictions  on  freedoms  of  expression  and  the
press, and the freedoms of peaceful assembly and association. Political protests occur
without warning in Egypt. Demonstrations have led to frequent violent clashes between
police and protestors, resulting in deaths, injuries, and property damage.
