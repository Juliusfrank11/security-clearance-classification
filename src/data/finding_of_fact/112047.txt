In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the delinquent obligations (SOR 1.a
-1.f), specifically admitting a $15,149 (SOR 1.a) medical debt, which he had been told
was covered by his health insurance, but later he learned the majority of the cost was not
covered by his insurance. (Tr. 21) He admitted he owed four student loans (SOR 1.c -1.f)
that were for his daughter’s college education. The loans totaling approximately $35,500
were  $2,572  past  due.  He  denied being  more  than  120 days  delinquent  on  a $32,478
(SOR 1.g) home equity loan, which he asserted had been paid when he sold his home in
June 2016. After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following
findings of fact.
1 The DoD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on September 1,
2006.
2 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my decision in
this case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/5220-6 R20170608.pdf.
Applicant is a 64-year-old aircraft technical design engineer who has worked for a
defense  contractor  since  July  2015.  (Ex.  2)  He  seeks  a  favorable  security  clearance
determination. (Ex 2) He is married and has a 31-year-old son, a 32-year-old daughter3,
and  a  36-year-old  stepdaughter.  (Ex.  2)  His  annual  income,  with  overtime,  is
approximately $110,000. (Tr. 44) His wife is not employed.
From November 2004 until January 2015, Applicant had worked as a contractor
for an aircraft manufacturing company. From January 2015 through July 2015, he was
unemployed due to company downsizing. (Tr. 43) In July 2015, he obtained a contractor’s
position with the same aircraft manufacturing company, but the position required him to
move to a new state. (Ex. 2) As a result of the move, he sold his house and had to pay
the cost of the 2,000 mile move. (SOR Response, Tr. 12).
In  2015,  Applicant  missed  two  or  three  mortgage  payments  on  his  loan  for  his
previous residence and worked with the Making Home Affordable Program. (Ex. 3) For
approximately  a  year,  from  July  2015  through  June  2016,  he  was  paying  his  $800
mortgage at his old location and paying for a hotel at his new location, which left no extra
money. (Ex. 3, Tr. 35) The SOR lists $1,869 as being 120 days past due on a $32,478
home  equity  line  of  credit.  (SOR  1.g)  In  June  2016,  he  sold  his  home.  (Ex.  3)  All
outstanding debts were paid at the time of sale, including the mortgage and equity line of
credit. (Tr. 28, SOR Response) He received $87,858 at the time of sale representing his
equity in the home. (SOR Response)
Three months after he sold his previous home, Applicant purchased a new home
at his new location. (Tr. 30) The home he purchased has been paid for in full. (Tr. 39) He
asserted  he  has  $25,000  in  savings  and  $5,000  in  his  checking  account.  (Tr.  40)  His
vehicles  are  paid  for  and  he  has  no  loan  payments  apart  from  his  payment  on  his
consolidated student loan. (Tr. 40) His only large monthly expenditure is $1,600 for health
insurance. (Tr. 48)
In 2015, when Applicant was unemployed, he was unable to make student loan
payments.  The  student  loans  were  for  his  daughter’s  college  education  and  had  been
obtained  between  November  2005  and  October  2008.  (Ex.  4)  The  loans  totaling
approximately  $35,500  were  $2,572  past  due.  In  June  2017,  he  contacted  the  federal
loan servicing company which serviced the student loans in order to consolidate the four
loans. (Ex. C-3) The servicing company’s February 2018 letter indicates he owed $39,203
on the student loans with monthly payments of $270. (Ex. C-1) At that time, he was zero
days  delinquent  on  the  loan  and  had  unpaid  interest  of  $57.  (Ex.  B)  The  student  loan
payment is automatically debited from his bank account. (Tr. 47) He asserts he has made
his monthly payments in a timely manner since March 2017. (Tr. 37)
During his June 2016 enhanced subject interview, he stated his intention was to
first buy a house and then establish a payment plan to resolve the student loan obligation.
(Ex. 3) At that time, he believed he could pay off all of the student loans in three to five
years. (Ex. 3)
3 At the hearing, Applicant stated his daughter was 24 year old and was living with him. (Tr. 23)
In March 2017, Applicant agreed to pay a financial repair company approximately
$600 over six months to assist him in restoring his credit profile and maximizing his credit
score. (Ex. C-2, Tr. 46) He had one financial counseling session with the company. (Tr.
38) He had incurred a $15,489 medical collection debt (SOR 1.a) when he had a stent
inserted  in  the blood  vessel  going  to his  liver.  (Tr. 44)  He  had medical  insurance, and
prior  to  the  procedure  had  been  told  the  medical  procedure  would  be  covered  by  his
insurance. (Tr. 24) After the procedure, he learned most of the cost was not covered by
his insurance. The medical debt no longer appears on his credit report. (Tr. 24, Ex. 6)
Applicant’s November 2015 credit report lists the four past-due student loans, a
past-due home equity line of credit, a past-due mortgage, and the medical collection debt
(SOR 1.a $15,489). (Ex. 4) It also list 18 accounts as being “paid as agreed.” His August
2016  credit  report  lists  a  zero  balance on his home  equity line  of credit  and  mortgage
loan. (Ex. 4) The credit report lists the medical collection account, but does not list any
amount as past due on the debt. (Ex. 5) His February 2018 credit report lists no collection
accounts or any past-due amounts. (Ex. 6) The medical debt no longer appears as a debt
on his February 2018 credit report. (Ex. 6) He asserted he paid the $115 medical debt
(SOR 1.b). (Tr. 27) The debt does not appear on either of his most recent credit reports.
(Ex. 5, Ex. 6)
