Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  3.a,  3.b,  and  3.c.  He  denied
SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  2.a.  He  is  50  years  old.  He  married  in  2000,  divorced  in  2009,  and
remarried  in  2010.  He  has  four  minor  children.  All  are  native-born  U.S.  citizens.  His
eldest child is from a prior relationship. His second child is from his prior marriage. His
youngest two children are from his current marriage.3
Applicant graduated from high school in 1986. He earned a bachelor’s degree in
1990  and  a  master’s  degree  in  2002.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from  1990  to  1994,
when  he  was  honorably  discharged.  He  has  since  worked  for  various  defense
contractors. As of the date of the hearing, he worked as a senior engineer for his current
employer, for whom he has worked since late February 2015. He previously worked for
the  same  company  from  June  2007  to  February  2009.  He  was  first  granted  a  security
clearance in 1990.4
Applicant’s  wife  was  born  in  Russia.  She  is  33  years  old.  She  earned  a
bachelor’s and a master’s degree from a university in Russia in around 2002 and 2009,
respectively.  She  first  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  2004.  She  then  returned  to
Russia,  where  she married  her first  spouse,  who  was then  a  Russian  citizen,  in  2005.
Her first spouse is now a U.S. citizen residing in the United States. They immigrated to
the United States in 2005 and divorced in 2007. She remarried a Ukrainian national in
2009 and they lived together in the United States. She then returned to Russia in 2009
for one month to finish her master’s degree, after which time she returned to the United
States. She divorced her second spouse in 2010.5

Applicant’s  wife  became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  2014.  She  renounced  her
Russian  citizenship  in  2016.  She  has  worked  as  a  business  financial  manager  for  an
engineering  firm  since  May  2015.  The  company’s  partner,  who  is  also  the  facility
security  officer  (FSO),  indicated  that  while  Applicant’s  wife  does  not  need  a  security
clearance, she has received security training like those who do. He described her as a
valued and trusted employee who safeguards the company’s confidential, sensitive, and
proprietary  information.  He  also  indicated  that  she  appears  to  be  a  loyal  American
citizen.6
Applicant’s  parents-in-law  and  brother-in-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Russia. His parents-in-law divorced in 2010. His father-in-law is 60 years old. Applicant
testified that his wife’s father is estranged from the family. She talks to her father several
times yearly, and she has seen him three times between 2008 and 2018. Her father met
her during one of her trips to Russia so that he could meet his grandson. Applicant has
never met or talked to his father-in-law. Applicant is unaware whether his father-in-law is
currently employed, and his wife believes her father is retired. Applicant’s father-in-law
is a former Russian military officer. Applicant testified that his father-in-law served in the
Russian military for several years from around 1983 to 1985, before he was discharged
for stealing rubbing alcohol.7
Applicant’s  mother-in-law  is  60  years  old.  She  works  as  an  accountant  for  a
brewery.  His  brother-in-law  is  24  years  old.  After  Applicant’s  brother-in-law  graduated
from  college,  he  completed  one  year  of  mandatory  service  in  the  Russian  military  in
around December 2017. He works as a chemist for a private pharmaceutical company.
Applicant  was  unaware  if  his  brother-in-law  had  any  ongoing  affiliations  with  the
Russian  government  or  military.  Applicant’s  wife  video  chats  with  her  mother  once
weekly.  She  is  close  to  her  brother  and  talks  to  him  more  frequently,  at  least  several
times  weekly  and  most  recently  because  of  his  imminent  wedding.  His  mother-in-law
speaks “very little” English and Applicant speaks “very little” Russian, so he simply says
“hello” and ensures that his children do the same on the occasions that his wife talks to
her mother. He has a similar relationship with his brother-in-law.8
Applicant traveled to Russia in 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2014. He followed security
clearance protocol and reported such travels to his FSO. His wife travels to Russia once
yearly, and she stays with her mother during such visits. Though Applicant planned to
travel to Russia with his family to attend his brother-in-law’s wedding and celebrate his
50th birthday, he elected not to do so while his clearance decision was pending. His wife
and two children planned to attend her brother’s wedding in Russia, where they would
stay  in  a  condominium  paid  for  by  her  brother.  His  mother-in-law  and  brother-in-law
have  visited  and  stayed  with  them  in  the  United  States.  They  did  so  before  Applicant
and  his  wife  married,  and  his  mother-in-law  did  so  again  after  the  birth  of  their  son  in

2013  for  six  months.  She  has  attempted  to  revisit  them  since  but  her  visa  has  been
denied at least three times.9
In around 2013, Applicant’s mother-in-law sold her condominium in Russia, and
gave $90,000 of the proceeds to Applicant and his wife, which they used as a deposit
for  their  home  in  the  United  States.  Applicant  reported  this  monetary  gift  to  his  FSO.
They  have  not  received  any  additional  money  and  his  wife  does  not  have  standing  to
inherit any money from anyone in Russia. They do not have any assets, obligations, or
affiliations in Russia. Their assets in the United States total around $1,840,000.10
Applicant’s in-laws in Russia are aware that he works as an engineer. He has not
told them that he holds a security clearance or works on U.S. Government contracts. He
is unaware if his wife has ever disclosed this information to them; she indicated that she
has  not  shared  information  about  Applicant’s  work  or  need  for  a  clearance  to  any
foreign national, to include her mother and brother. Applicant is unaware whether his in-
laws  in  Russia  have  ever  been  approached  by  anyone  in  the  Russian  government  or
military  seeking  information  about  him  or  his  employment.  He  testified  that  he  would
report  to  his  FSO  and  the  proper  authorities  any  attempts  by  anyone  in  Russia  to
blackmail him.11
Applicant  looked  at  pornography  on  his  work  computer  from  around  February
2014  through  February  2015.  At  the  time,  he  had  been  working  for  a  subcontractor
since 2008. He attributed his actions to the “gross miscalculation” he made as a result
of an “extreme amount of stress” from 2013 through 2015. His eldest child was born in
2013  with  a  medical  condition  requiring  multiple  surgeries  through  2015,  as  well  as
continuous  checkups  every  six  months  indefinitely.  He  described  this  experience  as  a
“traumatic” one. In addition, he and his wife “were not in a good spot at all” after she had
disclosed to him that she had multiple affairs between 2013 and 2015.12
Initially,  Applicant  only  looked  at  pornography  at  home.  When  he  became
addicted to it, he also looked at pornography at work. He testified that pornography:
[w]as  my  outlet,  that  was  my  release.  Whether  it  was  five,  ten  minutes,
you know, before work started. Ten, 20, 30 minutes after work . . . before I
went home . . . It relaxed me. It prepared me for going home and having to
work through everything that was going on in the house.
He  also  acknowledged  that  he  looked  at  pornography  at  work  at  lunch  time.  He
estimated that he looked at pornography at work an average of 15 to 30 minutes daily.

He maintained that it never interfered with his work. He did not tell anyone at the time
that he was looking at pornography at work because he knew it was improper.13
In  early  February  2015,  the  primary  defense  contractor removed Applicant  from
the U.S. Government contract to which he had been assigned through his subcontractor
company.  His  program  manager  informed  him  that  computer  monitoring  revealed  that
he had been accessing pornography on his work computer. He immediately reported his
removal and the reason for his removal to his company’s President, Vice President, and
FSO.  He  was  placed  on  administrative  leave  by  his  company  during  the  two-week
period  in  which  the  primary  contractor  conducted  its  investigation,  then  he  was
terminated by his company in around mid-February 2015.14
The investigation conducted by the primary contractor, summarized in an April 2,
2015 letter, consisted of a forensic examination of Applicant’s computer, an interview of
the  contract’s  technical  lead,  and  a  review  of  Applicant’s  time  sheets,  contract
documents,  and  internet  logs.  Applicant  was  never  interviewed.  The  investigation
determined  that  Applicant  viewed  pornography  during  periods  that  were  billed  to  the
U.S.  Government.  As  such,  the  primary  contractor  indicated  that  it  would  issue  to  the
U.S. Government a credit of $21,577.15
Applicant denied that he ever mischarged to the government contract any time in
which he looked at pornography at work. He testified that he was aware that the primary
defense contractor paid $20,000 to the U.S. Government agency in association with his
alleged mischarging; his company repaid the primary contractor $20,000 at the latter’s
request; he was unaware how the amount of $20,000 was quantified; and he was never
asked  to  repay  any  money.  He  acknowledged  during  his  July  2016  background
interview that the $20,000 was restitution for an established 100 hours of computer use
during  work  hours  for  personal  purposes.  A  May  2016  letter  memorializing  a  meeting
between Applicant, his attorney, and debarment officials, reflects that “it was clear that
[Applicant]  has  accepted  responsibility  for  mischarging  a  government  contract  for
misspent time.”16
Applicant  was  placed  under  surveillance  for  one  year  by  his  company’s  ethics
committee from 2016 to 2017. He was required to report his time and his computer was
monitored,  as  further  discussed  below.  He  has  had  no  other  unfavorable  issues.  He
testified  that  it  was  not  easy  for  him  to  stop  looking  at  pornography  at  work.  Once  he
was  terminated  by  his  prior  company,  he  sought  help  for  the  first  time.  He  voluntarily
attended multiple Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA) meetings for two  and a half years to
address his addiction. He no longer feels he is addicted to pornography, he intends to
continue  to  attend  SAA  meetings  in  the  future,  and  he  does  not  intend  to  look  at

pornography on his work computer in the future. He eventually disclosed his conduct of
viewing pornography at work and his consequent termination to his wife, who supports
his  SAA  attendance  and  has  herself  attended  such  meetings.  He  handles  stress  by
working out, playing games on his phone, and keeping busy with his family.17
Applicant’s character witness was a vice president for the defense contractor for
whom  they  worked.  He  was  also  Applicant’s  division  director  and  direct  supervisor  of
three  years.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance  at  various  occasions  over  a  30-year-
period.  Though  the  witness  was  not  involved  in  rehiring  Applicant,  he  testified  that
Applicant had self-reported his issue with his prior defense contracting company to both
the witness and his predecessor, and despite such knowledge, the predecessor chose
to  rehire  Applicant.  He  testified  that  he  was  aware  that  Applicant  viewed  pornography
on  his  work  computer  during  his  off  hours  while  employed  by  the  prior  defense
contractor;  he  self-reported  his  conduct  to  his  then-employer;  and  Applicant  had  to
leave that company after he was consequently removed from the contract. The witness
testified  that  he  was unaware  that  any  allegations  were  ever  substantiated  concerning
Applicant  mischarging  his  prior  employer  for  time  associated  with  his  pornography
usage at work.18
The  witness  testified  that  he  discussed  the  matter  with  an  individual  from
Applicant’s  prior  employer,  who  described  Applicant’s  conduct  as  a  mistake  and
indicated that Applicant had otherwise been trustworthy. The witness also testified that
he  discussed  the  matter  directly  with  Applicant  and  brought  it  to  the  attention  of  their
employer’s  ethics  committee.  The  committee,  noting  that  Applicant  did  not  have  any
unfavorable  issues  during  his  previous  employment  with  their  company,  placed
Applicant  on  a  one-year  observation  period  beginning  in  around  July  2016,  which
coincided with Applicant’s proposed debarment period.19
During  this  time,  Applicant  reported  his  time  to  the  witness  daily,  his  computer
access  was  monitored,  and  the government  contractor  to  which  he  was  assigned  was
asked  to  provide  any  relevant  observations.  At  the  year’s  conclusion,  the  committee
determined that there was no longer a need for further observation of Applicant and the
proposed  debarment  had  also  ended.  Applicant  continued,  however,  to  report  to  the
witness.  The  witness  has  received  favorable  reports  of  Applicant’s  performance,  and
rated  Applicant  outstanding  in  his  performance  evaluations.  He  testified  that  Applicant
has  complied  with  annual  security  and  ethics  trainings,  and  he  considers  Applicant
trustworthy,  of  good  judgment,  and  capable  of  following  rules  and  regulations.
Applicant’s  FSO  since  2010  described  Applicant  as  an  individual  who  follows  security
rules and procedures. His FSO also indicated that Applicant has completed his annual
security training requirements. 20

Russia
In  2016,  Russia  continued  to  be  a  leading  state  intelligence  threat  to  U.S.
interests.  Its  intelligence  services  target  U.S.  and  allied  personnel  with  access  to
sensitive computer network information. It is assuming a more assertive cyber posture
based on its willingness to target critical infrastructure systems and conduct espionage
operations, even when detected and under increased public scrutiny. It has developed a
ground-launched cruise missile that the United States has declared is in violation of the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
Russia  remains  one  of  the  top  two  most  aggressive  and  capable  collectors  of
sensitive U.S. economic information and technologies, particularly in cyberspace. Non-
cyberspace collection methods include targeting of U.S. visitors overseas, especially if
the  visitors  are  assessed  as  having  access  to  sensitive  information.  Russia’s  highly
capable  intelligence  services  are  using  human  intelligence  gathering,  cyber,  and  other
operations  to  collect  economic  information  and  technology  to  support  its  economic
development  and  security.  It  continues  to  take  information  warfare  to  a  new  level,
working to fan anti-U.S. and anti-Western sentiment both within Russia and globally.
The  most  significant  human  rights  problems  in  Russia  in  2015  involved
restrictions  on  the  ability  to  choose  one’s  government  and  freedoms  of  expression,
assembly,  association,  and
freedom;  political
the  media,  as  well  as
prosecutions and administration of justice; and government discrimination against racial,
ethnic,  religious,  and  sexual  minorities.  Other  problems  included  allegations  of  torture
and  excessive  force  by  law  enforcement  officials;  executive  branch  pressure  on  the
judiciary; electoral irregularities; and extensive official corruption. The government failed
to take steps to prosecute or punish most officials who committed abuses.

Although Russian law prohibits officials from entering a private residence except
in  cases  prescribed  by  federal  law  or  when  authorized  by  a  judicial  decision,
government officials entered residences and premises without warrants. While Russian
law also prohibits government monitoring of correspondence, telephone conversations,
and other means of communication without a warrant, government officials engaged in
electronic surveillance without appropriate authorization.
In October 2016, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Office of
the  Director  of  National  Intelligence  (ODNI)  issued  a  Joint  Statement  on  Election
Security,  stating  that  the  U.S.  intelligence  community  was  confident  that  the  Russian
government directed recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions,
including from U.S. political organizations. In December 2016, the DHS, ODNI, and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation released a Joint Analysis Report stating that activity by
Russian  intelligence  services  has  been  part  of  a  decade-long  campaign  of  cyber-
enabled  operations  directed  at  the  U.S.  Government  and  its  citizens.  The  campaign
included  spear  phishing;  targeting  of  government  organizations,  critical  infrastructure,
think  tanks,  universities,  political  organizations,  and  corporations;  theft  of  information
from  these  organizations;  and  the  recent  public  release  of  some  of  this  stolen
information.
