Applicant,  45,  has  worked  as  a  security  guard  with  several  different  federal
contracting  companies  since  October  2013.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,
earning  approximately  $60,000  annually,  since  December  2014.  He  completed  a
security clearance application, his first, in March 2015, disclosing a 2012 conviction for
driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol.  The  ensuing  investigation  revealed  a  more
extensive  criminal  record.  The  investigation  also  revealed  that  Applicant  failed  to  file
federal  and  state  tax  returns  for  a  number  of  years  between  2010  and  2015,  and  that
Applicant owes $7,000 on 12 delinquent accounts.3
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant’s  criminal  history  under  the  personal  conduct
guideline. Applicant’s first arrest for unlawful use of a vehicle, occurred in 1990 (SOR ¶
1.a).  He  was  among  a  group  of  people  participating  in  a  carpool.  Neither  he  nor  the
other passengers were aware that the driver did not have permission to use the car. He
was released without being charged. He was arrested again in 1992 for felony assault
on a police officer (SOR ¶ 1.b). Applicant testified that he and his friends intervened in a
domestic dispute they witnessed on a public basketball court. When the police arrived,
Applicant was one of several people arrested. He denies assaulting a police officer. The
charges were dismissed.  In 2011, Applicant was charged with domestic violence after
an incident involving his son, who was 20 at the time (SOR ¶ 1.e). The young man was
intoxicated and started hitting his 18-year-old sister. Applicant intervened. Although he
was  arrested,  Applicant  testified  that  he  was  released  without  charges.  Applicant  was
charged  in  March  2013  for  driving  with  a  suspended  license  (SOR  ¶  1.i)  and  in
November 2013 for driving on a revoked license (SOR ¶ 1.j). Applicant testified that he

was  unaware  of  the  status  of  his  license  in  March  2013  and  that  the  November  2013
incident was the result of an administrative mistake. Both charges were nolle prossed.4
Applicant  admits  being  arrested  multiple  times  for  alcohol-related  incidents.  He
was  arrested  in  1996  and  1998  for  DUI  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c  –  d).  The  dispositions  of  these
charges is not in the record. In 2009 and 2012, Applicant was charged with driving while
impaired  by  alcohol  (SOR  ¶¶  1.f  and  1.h)  He  was  convicted  both  times.  He  received
probation  before  judgment  for  the  2009  incident  and  served  seven  days  in  jail  for  the
2012 incident. At hearing, Applicant admitted that he had an alcohol problem. However,
he  realized  that  his  alcohol  consumption  habits  were  incompatible  with  his  work  as  a
security officer. He has abstained from alcohol since 2014.5
The  SOR  also  alleges  a  series  of  financial  issues,  specifically  that  Applicant
failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for 2010 through 2015 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a
and  1.b).    However,  based  on  wage  and  income  transcripts  in  the  record  for  2010
through 2012, Applicant was not required to file federal or state income tax returns for
2012.  Although  he  testified  that  his  2013  income  did  not  meet  the  minimum  filing
requirement,  he  did  not  provide  any  corroborating  documentation.  Applicant  explained
that  he  failed  to  file  his  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  because  “time  got  away
from him.”  He filed his 2011, 2014 and 2015 federal income tax returns in September
2017, but did not pay the additional taxes owed. He testified that his outstanding state
income tax returns were prepared, but he did not know if they had been filed. At hearing
he  admitted  that  he  also  failed  to  file  his  2016  and  2017  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns.6
Believing he owed outstanding federal taxes, Applicant testified that he intended
to hire a law firm to help him negotiate with the IRS to pay a reduced amount. However,
in  his  post-hearing  submissions,  he  provided  an  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS
filed in October 2018 to pay $11,048 in outstanding federal taxes for the 2011 and the
2014  through  2017  tax  years.  The  installment  plan,  which  requires  $400  monthly
installment,  begins  in  December  2018.  Applicant  did  not  provide  any  additional
information  about  the  status  of  his  outstanding  state  income  tax  returns.  Applicant  is
also in debt to the state for $1,064 (SOR ¶ 2.c) for an outstanding judgment. He claims
the judgment had been paid, but did not provide any corroborating documentation.7
In  addition  to  his  outstanding  income  tax  obligations,  the  SOR  also  alleges  that
Applicant owes $7,000 for 12 delinquent accounts (SOR ¶¶ 2.d through 2.n). Applicant
admits that he owes the accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 2.d through 2.i. In his answer, he
claimed  that  the  debts  were  consolidated  with  a  debt  repayment  program.  At  the
hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  signed  up  for  the  program,  but  did  not  execute  a

repayment plan. He provided documentation that he has made arrangements to resolve
SOR ¶ 1.e, the deficiency balance on an automobile loan. He plans to work additional
hours to pay the $1,226 debt. Applicant denies owing the debts  alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.j
through 1.n as he is not familiar with the accounts. He believes that the debts may be
attributed  to  identify  theft.  He  did  not  provide  any  documentation  to  establish  that  he
filed  an  identity  theft  complaint  or  that  he  challenged  the  debts  in  question  with  the
credit reporting agencies. The alleged delinquent accounts remain unresolved.8
Currently, Applicant provides the only source of income for his household, which
includes  his  partner  and  their  four  children,  ages  27,  25,  21,  and  15.  After  paying  his
recurring bills, Applicant has approximately $200 in disposable income each month. He
hopes  his  partner,  who  has  been  unemployed  since  April  2018,  is  able  to  secure
employment in the near future.9
