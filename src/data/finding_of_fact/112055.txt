Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations.  He  is  a  63-year-old  aircraft  mechanic
employed  by  a  U.S.  defense  contractor  since  June  1992.   He  has  previously  had
favorable background investigations in July 2002 and August 2013. The genesis of the
current background investigation is unclear (GE 1).
The SOR alleges, Government exhibits substantiate, and Applicant admits eight
delinquent  debts  totaling  over  $99,000.  The  debts  comprise  $200  in  delinquent  traffic
tickets  (SOR  1.k-1.l),   a  $2,700  state  tax  lien  (SOR  1.j),   four  delinquent  medical
accounts totaling nearly $1,400 (SOR 1.f-1.I),  and a delinquent education loan totaling
over  $95,000  (SOR  1.e).   The  SOR  also  alleges,  Government  and  Applicant  exhibits
establish,  and  Applicant  admits  filing  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  protection  five  times
between August 1998 and March 2018 (SOR 1.a-1.d and 1.m). The March 2018 filing
was  pending  approval  (AE  I);  the  October  2013  filing  was  converted  to  a  Chapter  7
petition in March 2014, and discharged in November 2014. The August 1998, October
2000, and September 2011 petitions were dismissed in October 1999, June 2001, and
March  2013,  respectively.   Applicant  completed  the  bankruptcy-required  financial
counseling in February 2018 [AE C(2)], and another financial counseling in March 2018
[AE C(1)]. His tentative Chapter 13 plan anticipated the creditors’ meeting later in April
He has also been self-employed in the vending machine business since April 2010.
Paid by Applicant on 2 February 2017 (Answer, AE H). The amounts and creditor are an exact match.
AE G, a 26 February 2018 letter from the state tax authority, reflects an agreement to pay $121.50 toward
a $716 tax liability. However, the account number listed is not the same as that listed on GE 2 and 3 for SOR
debt 1.j. Moreover, Applicant did not document any of the required payments for February and March 2018.
Applicant paid SOR 1.i on 30 January 2017 (AE F). He paid SOR 1.h on 30 January 2017 as well (Answer,
AE E). He paid SOR 1.g the same day (Answer). He offered AE M(10) as proof that SOR 1 f was paid on 15
February 2017, but the amounts do not match and GE 3 contains no account number for the account.
AE M(14) reflects that Applicant entered into a rehabilitation agreement on 24 June 2014 in which he was
to pay $5.00 monthly beginning 25 June 2016, and continuing until he made nine voluntary and on time
payments within a ten month period..AE D confirmed his entry into the program.  AE M(9) shows that he made
13  $5.00  payments  between  June  2017  and  February  2017,  at  which  point  the  rehabilitated  loan  was
apparently purchased by another lender in accordance with the rehabilitation agreement. The outstanding
balance for the loan when it went into rehabilitation was $92,421.46, almost the amount listed on Applicant’s
March 2018 petition (AE I, M(15) under a different creditor, presumably the successor-in-interest.
The August 1998 and October 2000 petitions were dismissed when Applicant received insurance settlements
which allowed him to repay his creditors. The September 2011 petition was dismissed when Applicant was
able to gather the funds necessary to repay his creditors.
2018, with confirmation in May 2018. The plan called for $700 monthly payments, and
Applicant made the first required payment the week after the hearing [AE M(12)].
Applicant reported his two most recent (at  the time) bankruptcy petitions on his
June 2015 clearance application (GE 1). He resolved approximately $60,000 in debt in
his September 2011 Chapter 13 petition, and resolved approximately $70,000 in debt in
his  November  2014  Chapter  7  discharge.  His  pending  Chapter  13  petition  lists
approximately $135,000 in unsecured claims, of which over $93,000 are an education
loan and another nearly $9,000 are to state and Federal tax authorities. Neither of these
debts  is  likely  to  be  dischargeable.  Applicant  documented  that  he  had  an  installment
plan with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and made his $100 July 2017 payment as
required [AE M(11)]. However, his balance at the time was over $9,000.  9

Applicant’  financial  problems  predate  his  August  1998  Chapter  13  bankruptcy
petition.  He  and  his  wife  have  been  plagued  with  a  seemingly  endless  string  of
accidents,  injuries,  and  illnesses.
The  August  1998  petition  was  precipitated  by  an
automobile  accident  that  left  her  unable  to  work  for  two  years  (Tr.  25),  but  was
dismissed  in  October  1999  when  the  case  settled  and  Applicant  was  able  to  pay  his
creditors. Similarly, the October 2000 petition was precipitated by another accident that
left  his  wife  unable  to  work  for  a  long  time;  additionally,  Applicant  had  an  illness  that
required a week in the hospital. However, the petition was dismissed in June 2001 when
the case settled and Applicant was able to pay his creditors.
Nevertheless, their medical adventures continued: in 2003, their minor child had
a  burst  appendix  and  was  hospitalized  for  three  weeks;  in  2004,  Applicant’s  wife  had
additional  knee  surgery  from  the  earlier  accident,  and  Applicant  had  pneumonia.  He
missed time at work, which was unpaid because he had used all his accumulated time
off. Applicant’s wife had another accident in 2005, had major breast cancer surgery in
2007, costing $30,000 out of pocket, and another accident. She had more knee surgery
in 2008 and a knee replacement in 2009.
Applicant had a collapsed lung in 2010, three surgeries to repair it, and six more
weeks  out  of work.  In  2011,  he  had  another bout  of  pneumonia,  and  was  out  of  work
another three weeks. He filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy again in September 2011, but
was able to catch up on his payments to his creditors and have the petition discharged
in  March  2013  (Tr.  53).    Meanwhile,  in  2012,  he  developed  knee  problems  himself
which required surgery. He filed another Chapter 13 petition in October 2013, converted
it to a Chapter 7 petition in March 2014, when he realized that he would not be able to
make  the  required  plan  payments,  and  was  discharged  of  his  dischargeable  debt  in
November 2014.
He listed $10,000 IRS debt on his March 2018 Chapter 13 petition.

Applicant’s wife experienced serious medical issues beginning in 1992, when she had three accidents; she
had another serious accident in 1994, and again in 1997, leading to surgery in 1998 (Tr. 45-46).
Applicant’s  financial  reprieve  was  short  lived.  In  2014,  his  wife  tripped  in  the
driveway,  smashed  her  elbow,  and  required  three  surgeries  to  repair  the  damage.
Applicant  took  time  off  from  work  to  care  for  her.  Their  out-of-pocket  expenses  were
$40,000-50,000.  In  2015,  she  had  another  accident,  which  required  her  fourth  neck
surgery  to  repair.  Those  out-of-pocket  expenses  ran  $20,000-$30,000.  She  later
contracted pneumonia in 2016, which devolved into bronchitis, incurring more medical
bills. Applicant was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2017, but the cancer was detected
early,  and  his  prognosis  is  good  (Tr.  37-38).  In  2018,  Applicant’s  wife  had  hip
replacement  surgery,  but  hurt  herself  while  in  rehabilitation,  which  required  a  second
surgery, and developed an infection which required a third surgery; the expected out-of-
pocket expense is $30,000.
Applicant  documented  his  credit  and  financial  counseling,  and  submitted  a
February  2018  personal  financial  statement  (PFS) showing $39  positive  monthly  cash
flow  (AE  J).  In  fairness  to  Applicant,  he  overlooked  additional  sources  of  income  [AE
M(5)-M(8)]. His March 2018 Chapter 13 petition shows $700 positive monthly cash flow.
Applicant’s work and character references [AE J, M(13)] have both known him for many
years,  are  aware  of  Applicant’s  financial  problems,  and  hold  clearances  themselves.
They consider Applicant honest and trustworthy, and recommend him for his clearance,
notwithstanding his financial troubles.
