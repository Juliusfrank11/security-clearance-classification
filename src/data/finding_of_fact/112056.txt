In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he stated he was working to resolve the $10,928
automobile loan (SOR 1.a) and $1,469 telephone service debt (SOR 1.b). He denied the
remaining six delinquent accounts. He admitted he had relatives who were citizens and

residents of Cameroon. After a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits,
I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  40-year-old  project  specialist  who  has  worked  for  a  defense
contractor since September 2014. (Ex. 1, Tr. 27) He seeks to obtain a security clearance.
(Ex. 1) He is married and has two children. (Ex.1, Tr. 59) He has never served in the U.S.
military. (Tr. 30) In February 2018, he received an applause award and monetary award
for his work contributions. (Ex. G) In December 2003, he received a Master’s of Business
Administration (MBA) from an American university. (Ex. 1)
Applicant was born in and was a citizen of Cameroon. In February 2000, Applicant
visited the United States when he came to the United States to further his education and
to avoid violence and turmoil in Cameroon. (Tr. 31) At that time, Cameroon was politically
unstable  and  had  a  high  murder  rate.  (Ex.  3)  He  feared  for  his  life  in  Cameroon  and
applied for political asylum in the United States. (Tr. 32) In 1997, he had been arrested
for  protesting  against  the  Cameroon  government.  (Tr.  33)  His  brother  had  also  been
arrested. (Tr. 35) One of his cousins has been jailed indefinitely and Applicant has had
friends  killed  by  the  police.  (Tr.  94)  The  government  had  been  autonomous  and  a
dictatorship.  (Tr.  34)  Cameroon  has  improved  politically  to  the  point  Applicant  visited
Cameroon for three weeks in 2013. That was his first visit since leaving the country in
2000. (Ex. 3, Tr. 64) Cameroon does not accept dual citizenship. (Tr. 52)
Applicant’s brother and his sister are Cameroon nationals. His other brother is a
naturalized U.S. citizen and lives with him. (Ex. 3, Ex. D, Tr. 20) A couple of months after
Applicant arrived in the United States, his brother arrived and two years later, his other
brother and sister arrived. (Tr. 19) His siblings were granted political asylum. (Ex. 3) One
brother  lives  in  Canada  and  is  a  Canadian  permanent  resident  pending  Canadian
citizenship. (Tr. 56) His sister, a cosmetologist, lives in Arkansas and is a U.S. registered
alien pending her citizenship. (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr. 20, Tr. 54) She cannot apply for citizenship
until she has been a registered alien for five years. (Tr. 53) In 2012 and 2013, he traveled
to Canada to visit his brother and in 2013, he visited his family in Cameroon, as previously
stated.
In June 2012, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen. (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr. 32)
He  feels  loyalty  to  the  United  States  and  has  no  divided  loyalty.  (Tr.  97)  His  wife  is  a
Cameroon national and has U.S. alien registration. (Ex. 3, Tr. 25) His wife was already
living  in  the  United  States  when  they  met  in  2011.  She  had  been  previously  jailed  in
Cameroon for political protesting and was granted political asylum in the United States.
(Tr. 63) They met in March 2011 and married in November 2011. (Ex. 1, Ex. 2) (Ex. 3) He
anticipates his wife will become a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2020. (Ex. 3, Ex. D) She is a
business analyst working for an insurance company. (Tr. 2, Tr. 59) His two children were
both born in the United States. (Tr. 59) His father-in-law is a Cameroon national, retired
from the Cameroon railway services, and is now a fireman. (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr. 60) Applicant
has contact with his father-in-law by telephone twice a month. (Tr. 61) His wife has two
siblings living in Cameroon and three living in the United States. (Tr. 62) The record is
silent as to Applicant’s contact with these individuals.
Applicant’s  mother  and father are  both  Cameroon  nationals and  are retired  civil
servants. In her mid-30 to mid-40s, his mother worked ten years as a meteorologist for
the Cameroon government. (Ex. 2, Ex. 3, Tr. 45, Tr. 46) After retiring, she worked as a
finance manager for a private construction and security company and is now retired. (Ex.
1, Ex. B, Tr. 25, Tr. 49) He has daily contact with her via email, text, or telephone calls
when she is in Cameroon. (Ex. 3) She is currently visiting him in the United States.
For nine or ten years, Applicant’s father, a Cameroon national, was one of thirteen
justices  on  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  Republic  of  Cameroon  and,  at  one  time,  was
president of the high court. (Tr. 41). (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr. 25, Tr. 39) When he turned 65 years
old, he retired.3 (Ex. B, Tr. 40) While his father served on the Supreme Court, it was the
highest  court4  in  the  country.  His  father  served  as  a  judge  in  Cameroon  in  various
positions  for  40  years.  (Tr.  38)  Applicant  has  contact  with  his  father  twice  a  week  via
email,  text,  or  telephone  calls.  (Ex.  3,  Tr.  51)  His  parents  receive  pensions  from  the
Cameroon government. (Tr. 66)
Applicant’s parents have decided not to move to the United States because they
would not be able to cope with the life style in the United States and because his father’s
arthritis would make winters in the United States unbearable for him. (Tr. 43) Applicant
would consider the area they live in Cameroon to be “very dangerous.” (Tr. 44) His mother
visits him in the United States every two years and is currently visiting him, as previously
stated. (Ex. 3, Ex. I) In March 2017, he applied for U.S. alien registration for his mother.
(Ex. I-2, Ex. I-3, Tr. 25, Tr. 51) With alien registration, an individual must live in the United
States  six  months  out  of  the  year,  which  is  another  reason  he  did  not  apply  for  alien
registration for his father. (Tr. 52)
The SOR alleges Applicant has four charged-off accounts totaling $23,175, three
collection accounts totaling $14,847, and he was $16,599 past due on another account.
The delinquent obligations totaled $54,621. He alleges that after completing his MBA in
2003  and  after  he  purchased  his  home,  he  started  receiving  letters  stating  he  had
purchased various goods, which he had not purchased. (Tr. 22, 29) When he located to
a job on the other coast, the company reviewed his credit and he discovered many flags
on his credit report. (Tr. 22) He disputed some of the accounts and made payments on
others. (Tr. 22) In 2008 or 2009, Applicant asserts he was the victim of identity theft. (Ex.
2) He now employs two different credit monitoring services, neither of which are credit
counseling services. (Ex. 2) The services are to notify him of any irregular activity, dispute
fraudulent activity, and alert him if his credit is pulled. (Tr. 85) He has had the service for
two years. (Ex. I, K)
In 2011, Applicant’s wife became ill and stopped working. She has now returned
to working. The home they own is located in another state and is rented to tenants. (Tr.
67) As of June 2015, Applicant owed approximately $218,000 on investment real estate.
3 Exhibit A, written in French and not translated, states Applicant’s father was due to retire because he was
65 years old. (Tr. 93)
4 Two or three  years ago,  Cameroon established a constitutional court,  which supersedes the Supreme
Court. (Tr. 37)
(Ex.  2)  At  the  hearing,  he  asserted  he  owed  $209,000  on  the  property  that  has  a  fair
market value of $250,000. He has put down a deposit on a new home being built where
they currently live. (Ex. F, Tr. 67) The new home costs $460,000. (Tr. 69) He intends to
keep his rental home after buying his new home. (Tr. 92)
The automobile debt listed in listed in SOR 1.a ($10,928) appears on Applicant’s
January 2015 credit report. (Ex. 4) A previous automobile loan with the same lender was
listed as “Pays as Agreed” with a high credit amount of $26,276 and a current balance of
$21,784. The auto loan obtained in June 2011 required monthly payments of $598 for 72
months. (Ex. 4) He had purchased a used BMW, which developed problems. He traded
it in, and in September 2012, and purchased an Acura using the same creditor for the
new auto loan. (Ex. I-5, Tr. 24)
In April 2016, Applicant could no longer afford the monthly car payments. (Ex. 3)
Even though he had not missed any payments on the loan, he called the bank and had
his  car  voluntarily  repossessed.  (Ex.  3)  At  the  time  of  the  repossession,  Applicant
asserted he owed $18,000 on the loan and the vehicle was sold for $11,000 following the
repossession. (Ex. 3) In his July 2016 enhanced subject interview, he said he was in the
process of setting up a repayment plan with the bank. In his July 2017 SOR response, he
stated he was working on a resolution of this debt. His November 2016 credit report lists
$5,626 past due on a $10,928 balance (SOR 1.a). (Ex. 6) At the hearing, he said he was
working with the creditor to reach a settlement agreement on the debt. (Tr. 71) He was
unsure  when  a  settlement  agreement  would  be  reached.  (Tr.  87)  His  May  2018  credit
report reflects $12,590 charged off as a bad debt. (Ex. I-5)
Applicant asserted he was unable to continue with payment on the loan because
his wife had a large amount of medical bills. (Ex. 3) The nature of his wife’s illness or the
cost of treatment are not reflected in the record. (Tr. 88) He said he was able to satisfy all
his other financial obligations.
During a June 2015 enhanced subject interview, Applicant stated that in 2002, a
student loan (SOR 1.f, $5,516) was opened in his name and his brother’s name by an
unknown person (Ex. 2) On his January 2015 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations
Processing (e-QIP) he stated the “loan was originated by my Brother,” and Applicant was
disputing the debt. (Ex. 1) He has disputed the loan since he found out about the loan in
2008 or 2009. (Ex. 2) In his April 2017 SOR Response, he denied the debt, but said he
was working to resolve it. His January 2015 credit report states the account was opened
in  January  2002  with  a  high  credit  level  of  $6,325  and  a  balance  of  $7,374.  The  loan
required monthly payments of $60 for 196 months. (Ex. 4) In March 2012, a debt of $5,516
was charged off. (Ex. 4) Applicant asserts this was his brother’s student loan and does
not know how or why it is attached to his credit report. (Tr. 78) This loan belongs to his
brother living in Canada. (Tr. 81) Applicant never co-signed on any student loans. (Tr. 78)
Applicant admits he has a student loan with the same company to pay for his MBA
education. That loan is current. (Tr. 78) His January 2015 credit report states the larger
student loan status is “Pays as Agreed,” and it had a $33,307 balance. That loan required
$196  monthly  payments  for  300  months.  (Ex.  4)  His  November  2016  credit  report
indicates the balance on the larger student loans is $30,510. (Ex. 5) As of December 31,
2017, the balance on the student loans was $28,645. (Ex. I-4) His February 2018 credit
report lists the balance as $28,658 with no past-due amounts. (Ex. 6) His May 2018 credit
report lists it as “current” with a balance of $28,114. (Ex. I-5)
In Applicant’s January 2015 e-QIP he stated he owed $4,000 on a bank credit card
(SOR  1.g,  $4,557).  (Ex.  1)  He  stated,  “I  had  a  business  in  2008  and  as  a  result  the
business accumulated some debt which I was the garantor [sic] and thus had to be liable.”
(Ex. 1) In his June 2015 interview he provided a different explanation of the charged-off
credit card debt. In the interview, he said the credit card account was opened in January
2009 by an unknown individual as a result of identity theft. (Ex. 2) He told the investigator
that  he  did  not  know  why  it  stated  that  he  had  a  business  in  2008,  and  as  a  result  of
business  debt accumulated,  he  was  liable.  (Ex.  2)  He  stated  he  did  not  know  why  the
case papers stated this. He asserted it was a fraudulent account, but asserted he paid it
in March 2011 “just because he wanted it off of his credit report.” (Ex. 2)
Applicant’s January 2015 credit report lists two bank credit card accounts with the
creditor listed in SOR 1.g ($4,557), which is the debt referred to in the previous paragraph.
(Ex. 4) He asserts one account is his, and he paid it, and the other account is a fraudulent
account. (Tr. 83) He asserted he could provide information on the account he paid. (Tr.
83) No documents showing the debt had been paid were received. Both accounts were
at times delinquent. One account opened in May 2006 had a high balance of $4,053 when
it was closed by the grantor. (Ex. 4) The debt went to collection. The second account with
the same creditor was opened in August 2007 and $4,557 was charged off in September
2014. (Ex. 4) He asserted he contacted the creditor, and they removed it from his credit
account. (Tr. 84) He provided no documentation supporting his assertion.
Applicant listed a federal credit union account debt of $7,300 on his e-QIP stating
he was disputing it and was working  with a company to resolve the issue. (Ex. 1) The
debt  (SOR  1.e,  $13,263)  was  an  automobile  loan  opened  in  September  2007  that
required $353 monthly payments for 72 months. (Ex. 4) The high credit on the loan was
$17,399. The delinquent obligation went to collection. (Ex. 4)
Applicant’s  January  2015  credit  report  lists  two  obligations  to  this  federal  credit
union, one in the amount of $13,263, listed as a collection account, and the other a $7,300
account  listed  as  “Pays  as  Agreed.  The  larger  account  was  listed  as  “closed”  and  the
smaller listed as “Account Closed by Grantor” and charged off. (Ex. 4) The credit report
lists both debts as “Dispute Resolved – Consumer Disagrees.” (Ex. 4) He assets this was
a fraudulent account, that he worked with the credit union, and they removed it from his
credit report. (Tr. 76) He provided no documentation supporting his assertion.
The  credit  card debt  in  SOR  1.h  ($2,174)  appears  on Applicant’s January  2015
credit report listing that $2,174 had been charged off in December 2010. He asserts he
reached a settlement with the creditor in 2011 and paid the debt. (Tr. 84) He provided no
documentation supporting payment of the debt. He asserted he cannot “get a hold of the
bank to validate my account status. But this account was paid in full.” (Ex. I-6)
Applicant’s November 2016 credit report lists a $1,469 telephone service collection
account  (SOR  1.b)  and  a  $115  cable  television  collection  debt  (SOR  1.c).  (Ex.  6)  He
asserted the telephone account debt was a fraudulent account. He has had numerous
communications with the telephone company and asserts the telephone company agreed
this was not his debt. (Tr. 72) His May 2018 credit report lists the account as closed and
seriously  past  due  date  and  assigned  to  a  collection  agency.  (Ex.  I-5)  The  debt  also
appears on his May 2018 credit report as closed and as a collection account. (Ex. I-5) As
of August 2018, he was still working with the creditor to have the debt removed from his
credit report. (Ex. I) The debt is not reported by one credit reporting agency. (Ex. I-5) The
cable debt arose when he moved. The account was paid and shows a zero balance on
his credit report. (Ex. I)
On Applicant’s January 2015 e-QIP he listed $16,000 owed to the creditor listed in
SOR 1.d ($16,599), but indicated it was caused by identity theft. On the e-QIP, he stated
he was working directly with all creditors and collection agencies listed on his credit profile
to fix any pending issues. He said he was doing so to make sure it does not happen again
and also to make sure his credit profile is correct. (Ex. 1)
The past-due account listed in SOR 1.d ($16,599) appears on Applicant’s January
2015 credit report listing the account as being opened in November 2011. It was listed as
being 120 days or greater past due and in collection. (Ex. 4) The credit report also lists
the account as “Account in Dispute.” In his June 2015 subject interview, he asserted this
debt was a fraudulent account opened by an unknown person. (Ex. 2) At the hearing, he
said, “I have no idea what this one – This one, too, was also a long time, and I just kept
calling  them  and  denying  [responsibility  and  stating]  that  it  wasn’t5  my  debt,  and
eventually,  it  was  removed  from  my  account.”  (Tr.  76)  He  provided  no  documentation
supporting this assertion.
Applicant  makes  regular  contributions  to  his  401(k)  retirement  plan  and  has  a
balance of approximately $53,000 in the plan. (Ex. H, Tr. 68) His wife has approximately
$11,000 in her retirement plan. (Tr. 69) He has approximately $31,000 in savings. (Ex. I-
1Tr. 69) Over the past four years he has spent approximately $30,000 working with his
brother  to  develop  a  computer  application.  (Tr.  90)  His  May  2018  credit  report  lists  a
collection account with a zero balance. (Ex. I-5)
Prior  to  closing  arguments,  Applicant  was  again  informed  of  the  importance  of
to  support  his  assertions  of  payment,  settlement,  or
providing  documents
acknowledgement by the creditors that the delinquent obligations are not his. (Tr. 103)
Republic of Cameroon
French  Cameroon  became  independent  in  1960  as  the  Republic  of  Cameroon.
The following year the southern portion of neighboring British Cameroon voted to merge
with  the  new  country  to  form  the  Federal  Republic  of  Cameroon.  The  country  has
generally enjoyed stability, which has enabled the development of agriculture, roads, and
5 Applicant probably meant to say he kept calling them and denying it “was” his debt.
railways, as well as a petroleum industry. Political power remains firmly in the hands of
the President.
The  United  States  established  diplomatic  relations  with  Cameroon  in  1960,
following  the  independence  of  the  French-administered  part  of  the  country.  Cameroon
has  had  just  two  presidents  since  independence.  U.S.  relations  with  Cameroon  are
positive,  although from  time  to  time  they  have  been  affected  by  concerns over  human
rights abuses and the pace of political and economic liberalization. Cameroon plays a key
role in regional stability and remains a strong regional partner with the United States in
countering terrorism in the Lake Chad Region. Cameroon is currently the United States’
124th largest goods trading partner.
International  migration  from  Cameroon  has  been  driven  by  unemployment
(including fewer government jobs), poverty, the search for educational opportunities, and
corruption. The United States and Europe are preferred destinations. Cameroon has a
large youth population, with more than 60% of the populace under the age of 25.
The U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens to avoid all travel to the North and
Far North Regions and parts of the East and Adamawa Regions of Cameroon because
of terrorist threats, the risk of violent crime, and civil unrest. (Cameroon Travel Warning,
U.S.  Embassy  in  Cameroon)  Violent  crime,  such  as  armed  robbery  and  carjacking,  is
common.  Local  police  lack  the  resources  to  respond  effectively  to  serious  criminal
incidents. In the North and Far North Regions, as well as parts of East and Adamawa
Regions,  terrorists  may  attack  with  no  warning,  targeting  local  facilities,  and  places
frequented  by  Westerners.  Kidnapping  by  terrorists  and/or  kidnapping  for  ransom  are
serious concerns in Cameroon.
In Northwest and Southwest Regions, an Anglophone separatist movement has
led to increased levels of violence. Armed clashes with the government and other acts of
violence  have  occurred.  The  Boko  Haram  terrorist  group  has  actively  targeted  foreign
residents, tourists, and government leaders in the North and Far North Region. The U.S.
Embassy’s ability to provide consular services in remote and rural areas of Cameroon is
extremely  limited  and  the  U.S.  Government  has  limited  ability  to  provide  emergency
services to U.S. citizens.
