Applicant denied all five SOR allegations with explanations. After a thorough and
careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of
fact.
Applicant  is  a  40-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  pages  5
and 9.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since April of 2016. (GX 1 at
page 9.) He is married, and has three children. (TR at page 13 line 25 to page 14 line
16.) Applicant attributes his past financial difficulties to a substantial cut in his pay, and
to medical issues for both his spouse and his 14-year old daughter. (TR at page 25 line
23 to page 26 line 11.) He is addressing the Governmentâ€™s concerns, listed below, and
lives  within  his  family  budget.  (TR  at  page  332  lines  5~11,  and  AppX  B  the  last  three
pages.)
1.a. Applicant is making monthly payments of $360 towards the past-due debt to
Creditor  A,  which  has  now  been  reduced  to  about  $6,298.  (TR  at  page  20  line  22  to
page 25 line 2.) This is evidenced by documentation from Creditor A. (GX B at page 2.)
1.b.  Applicant is making monthly payments of $101 towards the past-due debt to
Creditor  B,  which  has  now  been  reduced  to  about  $3,189.  (TR  at  page  26  line  15  to
page 27 line 13.) This is evidenced by documentation from Creditor B. (GX B at page
4.)
1.c. Applicant is making monthly payments of $130 towards the past-due debt to
Creditor C, which has now been reduced to about $2,054. (TR at page 27 line 4 to page
30 line 3.) This is evidenced by documentation from Creditor C. (GX A.)
1.d. Applicant is making monthly payments of $80 towards another past-due debt
to Creditor B, which has now been reduced to about $2,607. (TR at page 32 line 18 to
page 33 line 4.) This is evidenced by documentation from Creditor B. (GX B at page 3.)
1.e.  Applicant  has  paid  the  alleged  past-due  medical  debt  to  Creditor  E,  as
