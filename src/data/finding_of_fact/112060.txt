Applicant is a 46-year-old warehouse material expeditor, employed by a defense
contractor since 1998. He graduated from high school in 1991. He married in 1992 and
divorced in 2008. He again married in 2014. He has two adult children and one adult step-
son. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1992 to 1997, and was honorably
discharged. Applicant was previously granted a top secret security clearance with access
to sensitive compartmented information in 2006, but it was revoked for financial concerns
and denied by a DOHA Administrative Judge in 2013.
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  is  delinquent  on  nearly  $20,000  in  debts,  including
unpaid Federal income taxes for tax year 2015, and child support obligations. The SOR
also  alleges  that Applicant filed  a  Chapter 13  bankruptcy  in  September 2007  that  was
dismissed in November 2007, and that Applicant failed to file Federal and state tax returns
when  due  for  tax  years  2009-2013.  The  SOR  allegations  are  sufficiently  supported  by
relevant evidence.
Applicant’s financial problems began during his first marriage and 2008 divorce.
Applicant  and  his  spouse  filed  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  in  2007  to  reorganize  about
$30,000  in  debts.  (Tr. 31)  The  bankruptcy  was  dismissed  because  Applicant’s  debt  to
income  ratio  did  not  qualify  for  a  Chapter  13  proceeding.  (GE  3)  He  did  not  pursue  a
Chapter 7 discharge. By 2013, Applicant again had nearly $30,000 in delinquent debts.
(GE 10) He attributed these debts to medical expenses, his divorce in 2008, his former
spouse’s  poor  spending  habits,  and  a  decrease  in  work  hours.  After  a  2013  DOHA
hearing,  Applicant  was  denied  security  eligibility  based  on  his  unmitigated  delinquent
debts.
Applicant failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2009
through  2013,  when  due.  He  later  filed  the  delinquent  returns,  and  owes  the  IRS
approximately $4,000 in unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest from the 2015 tax year. At
his hearing in this case, Applicant admitted that his Federal and state income tax returns
for  2016  and  2017  were  also  past  due  and  unfiled.  In  his  post-hearing  submission,
Applicant did not provide evidence that these returns have been filed.  He attributed his
failure to file tax returns on time to his inability to work with his former spouse regarding
claiming the children as dependents, and their efforts to reconcile. He also admitted that
he did not have sufficient money to pay taxes owed. He did not seek assistance from a
tax preparer, and he has not arranged a payment plan with the IRS.
After their divorce, Applicant and his ex-spouse reconciled and lived together from
late 2008 to 2011. They purchased a 2009 luxury vehicle together. His spouse kept the
vehicle after they separated in 2011, and it was repossessed in 2012. Applicant is jointly
responsible for the debt. He noted that he contacted a debt collection agency in 2012 or
2013, but was unable to renegotiate the debt which totals over $8,000. (SOR ¶ 1.a)  He
claimed that subsequent contact with the agency showed they no longer held the debt.
Applicant’s  2017  credit  report  shows  the  debt  became  delinquent  in  2011  and  was
charged off. No post-hearing documentation was provided to show the current status of
the debt or Applicant’s efforts to resolve it.
SOR ¶ 1.c is a $6,816 timeshare property debt, placed in collection with an agency
in about 2015. Applicant admitted the debt, and stated that he has been making automatic
monthly payments from his bank account to resolve it. The debt no longer appears on his
2016 or 2017 credit reports.
Applicant is delinquent on a mortgage for rental property he owns. He stated that
the property is occupied, but he has been unable to catch up on his mortgage payments
that became delinquent in May 2017, when he used the funds to pay for maintenance of
the  property.  The  debt  is  reported  on  his  2017  credit  report  as  a  past-due  Veterans
Benefits Administration mortgage. (SOR ¶ 1.d) No post-hearing information was provided
showing the current status of the mortgage or efforts to resolve the past-due debt.
Applicant  became  delinquent  on  child-support  obligations  because  of  a
disagreement with his former spouse. (SOR ¶ 1.e) His pay was involuntarily garnished in
2016 or 2017, and released in July 2018 after the arrearage was paid. (AE F) This debt
is resolved.
Applicant has not sought financial counseling nor does he have a budget. He noted
that since his 2013 DOHA case, he controls his purchases and pays his debts. He has
less than $1,200 in savings. His current supervisor testified to Applicant’s trustworthiness
and work ethic. He noted that Applicant is a family man who would never put himself in a
negative light in front of his children, and that his financial problems have not affected his
work. Several other co-workers also attested to his trustworthiness, reliability, dedication,
expertise and professionalism.
Law and Policies
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484  U.S.  518, 528  (1988). As  Commander in  Chief,  the President  has  the  authority  to
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is  clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An
administrative  judge  must  consider  a  person’s  stability,  trustworthiness,  reliability,
discretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG ¶ 1(b).
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the
possible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant
has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the  President  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  have
established for issuing a clearance.
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the
personal or professional history  of  the applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant from
being  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information.  The  Government  has  the  burden  of
establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531.
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v.
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria
listed  therein  and  an  applicant’s  security  suitability.  See  ISCR  Case  No.  92-1106 at 3,
1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).
Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 1(d).
