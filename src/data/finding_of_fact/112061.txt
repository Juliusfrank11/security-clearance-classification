Applicant is 57 years old. He graduated from high school in 1979 and had some

The SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts totaling approximately $26,571, including a
past-due second mortgage on his primary residence in the amount of $14,681 at SOR ¶
1.i. The SOR also alleges three delinquent medical debts, utility and credit-card debts.
Applicant did not disclose any of these delinquencies in section 26 (Financial Record) of
his SCA. (GE 1)
Applicant’s  credit  reports  reflect  that  he  obtained  a  primary  mortgage  in  the
approximate amount of $148,000 in March 2006. (GE 2) At the same time, he obtained
a  home  equity  loan  or  second  mortgage  in  the  amount  of  $37,000.  Both  loans  were
transferred several times, and Applicant has continuously paid his primary mortgage as
agreed.  (GE  2–6)  His  2014  credit  report  indicates  that  the  second  mortgage  was  past
due  in  the  amount  of  $14,681,  and  the  last  activity  on  the  account  was  in  December
2011  before  it  was  closed  and  transferred.  (GE  2)  A  real  property  transaction  record
concerning his primary residence, reflects that at some point the second mortgage was

clearance  application  (SCA)  and  the  summaries  of  his  security  clearance  interviews  on  February  17,
2015, and November 1, 2016.
transferred to Countrywide Mortgage Company.2 (GE 7) It fell off Applicant’s later credit
reports without explanation. (GE 5-6)
In his personal subject interview (PSI)  with a clearance investigator in February
2015, Applicant stated he had been making payments of $350 per month on the second
mortgage  when  he  fell  behind  on  payments.  (GE  8)  He  tried  to  negotiate,  but  the
creditor  wanted  payment  of  the  full  $14,681  due,  and  he  could  not  afford  to  pay  that.
Applicant  testified  credibly  that  since  then,  the  second  mortgage  (SOR  ¶  1.i)  was
transferred and he has made multiple phone calls to try to discern the present creditor
holding that loan, to no avail. (Tr. 53-54) He fell behind on payments because he had a
heart attack in 2011. He was disabled, and out of work, for six months. (Tr. 33, 55) The
creditor  stopped  communicating  with  Applicant.  He  testified  that  he  refinanced  his
primary  residence  in  August  2018  without  problems  and  there  was  no  mention  of  the
second  mortgage  by  his  present  lender.  (Tr.  57-60)  Applicant  corroborated  this  by
including  a  closing  disclosure
providing  supplemental,  post-hearing  documents
statement showing a payoff of $124,195 to the previous mortgagee and no reference to
any second mortgagee.3 (AE A)
SOR  ¶  1.a  is  for  a  medical  debt  placed  for collection  in  the  amount  of  $2,229.
Applicant testified that this was a result of an ambulance ride required to transport him
between hospitals after his heart attack. (Tr. 37) He felt that the total ambulance bill of
$4,000  was  exorbitant for  a  short  ride.  Nonetheless,  he  is  now  in  a  payment  plan  and
making monthly payments of $150 per month on this debt. (AE A) SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d
are  also  medical  debts  placed  for  collection  by  the  same  creditor  as  a  result  of  co-
payments  that  were  not  covered  by  Applicant’s  medical  insurance.  These  have  been
paid in full. (Tr. 39-40, AE A, GE 5) Applicant testified that the charged-off debt for $242
at SOR ¶ 1.b was for the purchase of a horse trailer. (Tr. 38) It was paid in full in May
2017. (AE A)
Applicant  testified that  the debt  placed for  collection  in  the amount  of  $1,077 at
SOR  ¶  1.e  was  disputed  with  the  three  major  credit-reporting-bureaus  as  it  is  not  his
credit-card  debt.  (Tr.  40-41)  He  researched  the  matter  and  made  phone  calls  to  the
original creditor (bank). Applicant provided post-hearing documentation that the creditor
was  unable  to  substantiate  these  debts  and  no  longer  considers  them  valid  collection
accounts.  (Tr.  42,  AE  B)  Applicant  was  overseas  for  extended  periods  of  time  for  his
job, and he admits that he did not check his credit reports for about 10 years. (GE 8) He
2 This  disgraced  mortgage-lender  was  “at  the  epicenter  of  the mortgage meltdown  that  in  2008  brought
the nation’s economy to its knees.” (N.Y. Times, June 24, 2016 article) John Leibowitz, Chairman of the
Federal Trade Commission was quoted “Its business model was based on deceit and corruption, and the
harm  caused  to  the  American  consumer  is  absolutely  massive  and  extraordinary.”    Countrywide  was  a
subsidiary of Bank of America (BOA). The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) reached a $16.65 Billion civil
settlement with BOA in 2014 for systematic mortgage fraud – the largest civil settlement against a single
entity in American history. See DOJ Office of Public Affairs press release dated August 21, 2014 – Bank

estate law and practices.
told the clearance investigator he was not aware of the credit-card debts and he ignored
some debts. He has an active account with the creditor at SOR ¶ 1.e. He testified that
the same status applies to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.g ($1,466) and ¶ 1.l ($4,419), which
are for a credit-card debt placed for collection in the amount of $4,419 and an account
placed  for  collection  for  $1,466.  These  were  effectively  disputed  and  the  creditor  no
longer considers them to be valid debts. (AE B)
The  credit-card  debt  placed  for  collection  by  a  bank  at  SOR  ¶  1.h  was  also
effectively disputed to the three credit bureaus, and the creditor no longer considers it a
valid  debt.  (AE  B)  This  was  a  credit  card  for  a  home-improvement  store.  (GE  8)  The
debt  placed  for  collection  by  a  telecommunication  company  in  the  amount  of  $197  at
SOR ¶ 1.f has been paid in full. (GE 5-6) The retail store debt placed for collection in the
amount  of  $1,157  at  SOR  ¶  1.j  was  compromised  and  settled  for  $354.  (AE  A)  The
delinquent phone bill at SOR ¶ 1.k for $296 was paid in full in July 2014. (AE A, Tr. 46)
The debt placed for collection by a bank in the amount of $1,466 at SOR ¶ 1.l was for a
computer that Applicant never received. (GE 8) He disputes this debt.
Applicant testified that he had a salary of $135,000 to 140,000 in 2018. (Tr. 60)
He receives $600 a month in military retirement, and he has approximately $15,000 in
savings.  He  told  the  clearance  investigator  that  he  and  his  wife  have  residual  or
discretionary income of approximately $ 3,000 each month. (GE 8) Applicant completed
his SCA in Korea in July 2014. He did not list his delinquent debts because he was not
aware  of  them,  and  he  admits  making  financial  mistakes  and  not  checking  his  credit
reports.  (Tr.  70)  He  testified  credibly  that  he  was  honestly  unaware  of  these
delinquencies and he did not deliberately intend to deceive the government or falsify the
SCA.
