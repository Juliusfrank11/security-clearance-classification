Applicant  admitted  to  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  through  1.e,  with  some
explanation. He denied SOR allegation ¶ 1.f. After a thorough and careful review of the
pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  49-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  pages  5
and 12.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since 2010. (GX 1 at page
12.) Applicant emigrated from what is now Ukraine (formerly part of the Soviet Union),
and  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  December  of  1991.  (GX  1  at  pages  6~7,  and  TR#2  at
page  7  lines  18~20.)    He  is  married  to  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  who  also  emigrated
from Ukraine. (GX 1 at pages 20~21.) Applicant has four adult children, and a 13 year-
old  son.  (GX  1  at  pages  23.)  Both  Applicant’s  father  and  an  uncle,  because  of  their
Pentecostal religious beliefs, were sent to Soviet prisons where they perished. (TR#2 at
page 8 line 18 to page 9 line 23~27.) Applicant is a “deacon” for his Pentecostal church,
as  evidenced  by  a  letter from his “Pastor.”  (AppX  C at  page  2.)  Applicant  net  worth  in
the United States is about $400,000. (TR#2 at page 40 lines 6~17.)
1.a.  and  1.d.  Applicant  brother,  who  is  married  to  a  German  national,  is  a  dual
national of Germany and Ukraine. (TR#2 at page 16 line 11 to page 17 line 10,  and at
page  17  line  25  to  page  26  line  14.) This  brother  is  a  Pentecostal  missionary,  who  at
times travels to  Russia,  but presently  resides  “in  Estonia  or Latvia.” (TR#2  at  page  26
lines  7~14.)  Since  about  2007,  Applicant  has  provided  about  $100  each  month  in
financial support for his missionary brother. (TR#2 at page 16 line 11 to page 17 line 10,
and at page 17 line 25 to page 26 line 14.) In 2013, Applicant also provided this brother
with a lump sum, one-time $5,000 gift. (Id.)
1.b.  Applicant’s  other  brother,  and  his  two  sisters,  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Ukraine.  (TR#2  at  page  26  line  15  to  page  33  line  5.)  His  brother  “is  working
construction” in Germany.  (TR#2 at page 26 line 15 to page 27 line 22.) Applicant’s two
sisters are both housewives living in the Ukraine. One is the mother of “18 kids,” and the
other  “had  11”  children.  (TR#2  at  page  26  line  15  to  page  33  line  5.)  None  of  these
siblings have any connection with the Ukrainian government.
1.c.  and  1.e.  Applicant’s  77  year-old  mother-in-law  is  a  “retired”  citizen  and
resident of the Ukraine (TR#2 at page 33 line 7 to page 35 line 12.) Since about 1994,
Applicant, through his wife, has provided about $100 each month in financial support for
his  mother-in-law.  (TR#2  at  page  17  lines  10~21.)  Applicant’s  mother-in-law  has  no
connection with the Ukrainian government.
1.f.  Applicant  admits  that  he  was  investigated  in  2015  for  possible  connections
with a Russian/Armenian criminal organization. (TR#2 at page 22 lines 4~19, at page 39
line  8  to  page  40  line  5,  and  GX  2.)  No  such  connection  was  found,  and  Applicant
denies any such connection. (Id.)
Notice
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  following  facts:  Ukraine  is  a  republic  with  a
semi-presidential  political  system.  In  2014,  the  Ukrainian  parliament  approved  a  new
government, which caused Russia to respond by seizing Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula.
Additional  unrest  occurred  in  2014,  involving  thousands  of  pro-Russian  protesters  in
eastern  and  southern  Ukraine.  In  2015,  a  ceasefire  agreement  established  a  de  facto
dividing  line  between  Ukrainian  government-controlled  and  separatist-held  areas  in
Ukraine. (GX 5.)
