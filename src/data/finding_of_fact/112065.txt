Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR,  with  explanations.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  40-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  pages  5
and  14.)  He  has  been  employed  with  the  defense  contractor  “since  November  2016.”
(TR  at  page  13  line  21  to  page  16  line  11.)  Previously  divorced  “in  2014,”  he  is  now
married to a Philippine national, and has two children from his previous marriage. (Id.)
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a.  and  1.d.  Applicant’s  wife  is  a  citizen  of  the  Philippines,  but  resides  with
Applicant  in  Korea.  (TR  at  page  16  line  19  to  page  18  line  21,  and  at  page  35  lines
5~11.)  He  gives  his  wife  about  $250  each  month  which  she  deposits  in  a  Philippine
bank account. (Id.)
1.b.,  and  1.c.  Applicant father-in-law  “passed  away” in  2017, and  his mother-in-
law “is a homemaker.” He currently provides no financial support for his mother-in-law,
who plans to join her sister in the United States. (TR at page 19 line 3 to page 20 line
22, and at page 23 lines 2~13.)  Applicant’s seven brothers-in-law and two sisters-in-law
“live in the mountains.” (TR at page 19 line 3 to page 20 line 22.) The men work “a little
construction, [and] farm work,” while the women “wash clothes for money.” (TR at page
34 line 8 to page 35 line 11.) “They [all] think . . . [Applicant fixes] electronics.” (TR at
page 22 line 23 to page 23 line 1.)
1.e. Applicant only owns property in the Philippines, worth about $18,000, where
he plans to “retire” in about 15~20 years.  He does not own any property in the United
States. (TR at page 21 line 12 to page 22 line 22.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
Applicant  attributes  his  current  financial  difficulties  to  the  hospitalization  of  his
former spouse, his subsequent divorce, a cut in pay, and a personal bout with stomach
cancer. (TR at page 26 line 11 to page 27 line 15, and at page 38 line 16 to page 40 line
25.)
2.a.  Applicant  has  filed  his  Federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2014  and
2015, as evidenced by documentation included in his Answer to the SOR.  (TR at page
25 line 25 to page 26 line 10, at page 27 line 19 to page 28 line 15, and Answer.)  This
allegation is found for Applicant.
2.b.    Applicant  owes  a  past-due  debt  to  the  Army  and  Air  Force    Exchange
Service  (AFES)  in  the  amount  of  about  $11,000.  (TR  at  page  28  lines  16~21,  and  at
page  37  lines  5~20.)  Despite  having  two  months  after  his  hearing  to  do  so,  Applicant
has provided nothing further in this regard. This allegation is found against Applicant.
2.c., 2.e., and 2.f.   Applicant owes three past-due debts to a credit union in the
amount of about $21,000. (TR at page 28 line 22 to page 31 line 4, at page 32 line 3 to
page 35 line 8, and at page 36 line 12 to page 37 line 4.) Despite having two months
after his hearing to do so, Applicant has provided nothing further in this regard. These
allegations are found against Applicant.
2.d.  Applicant  has  paid  a  $532  past-due  debt  on  an  automobile  loan,  as
evidenced  by  documentation  showing  this  automobile  has  been  sold.  (TR  at  page  31
lines 5~17, and AppX A.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
Notice
I take administrative notice of certain facts relating to the Philippines: the United
States  continues  to  work  with  the  Philippine  government  to  monitor  and  investigate
groups  engaged  in  or  supporting  terrorist  activities  in  the  Philippines.  The  Philippine
government  is  also  currently  engaged  in  a  nationwide  counter-narcotics  campaign.
Extrajudicial killings have been the chief human rights concern in the Philippines.
