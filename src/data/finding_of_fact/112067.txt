In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  with  comments  all  of  the  factual
allegations pertaining to financial considerations of the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.e.).
Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration
of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as an information systems service operations manager since around 1994 with a business
unit of one company that was eventually purchased by another company. A 1981 high
school graduate, Applicant earned some college credits, but no degree. He enlisted in the
U.S.  Air  Force  in  August  1981,  and  he  served  on  active  duty  until  he  was  honorably
discharged  in  December  1991  as  a  Staff  Sergeant  (E-5).  He  was  granted  a  secret
clearance in 1981, and has retained that clearance except for periods when he possessed
a  top  secret  clearance  with  access  to  Sensitive  Compartmented  Information  (SCI).
Applicant was married in July 1985, separated in August 2012, and divorced in December
2016.  He  started  cohabiting  in  September  2014,  and  in  October  2017,  he  was  again
married. He has two daughters, born in 1991 and 2001.
1 Effective June 8, 2017, by Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), dated December
10, 2016, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) for all covered individuals who require initial or
continued  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  or  eligibility  to  hold  a  sensitive  position,  were
established  to  supersede  all  previously  issued  national  security  adjudicative  criteria  or  guidelines.
Accordingly,  those  guidelines  previously  implemented  on  September  1,  2006,  under  which  this  security
clearance review case was initiated, no longer apply. In comparing the two versions, there is no substantial
difference that might have a negative effect on Applicant in this case.
Military Service, Awards, and Decorations
During  his  military  service,  Applicant  was  deployed  from  August  1990  until
February 1991 in support of Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm. He was awarded
the Air Force Commendation Medal, the Joint Service Achievement Medal, the Air Force
Achievement  Medal,  the  Joint  Meritorious  Unit  Award,  the  Air  Force  Outstanding  Unit
Award,  the  Air  Force  Good  Conduct  Medal  (with  two  clusters),  the  National  Defense
Service Medal, the Air Force Overseas Short Tour Ribbon, the Air Force Overseas Long
Tour  Ribbon,  the  Air  Force  Longevity  Service  Award  Ribbon,  the  Non-Commissioned
Officer  Professional  Military  Education  Graduate  Ribbon,  the  Small  Arms  Expert
Marksmanship Ribbon, and the Air Force Training Ribbon.2
Financial Considerations3
Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to several different issues that initially
arose in or about mid-2012: he and his wife separated, leading to a lengthy and costly
divorce; he was required to maintain two households during the period of separation; he
was  ordered  to  pay  child  support  and  alimony;  his  employer  was  unsuccessful  in  re-
competing  on a contract, and he was initially issued a layoff notice; he was subsequently
offered a new position with the same employer which required that he relocate, at his own
expense, to a different state;4 and although his primary residence was on the market for
over  six  months,  it  did  not  sell.  Because  of  the  additional  unexpected  expenses,
insufficient  funds  caused  him  to  fall  behind  on  his  mortgage.  Although  Applicant
attempted to obtain mortgage relief through the Home Affordable Modification Program
(HAMP)  in  August  2015,5  and  offered  to  include  a  deed-in-lieu  of  foreclosure,  nothing
worked, and the property was eventually foreclosed.
The SOR identified five purportedly delinquent accounts that had been placed for
collection, charged off, or foreclosed as generally reflected by Applicant’s November 2015
credit report or December 2016 credit report. Those debts total approximately $272,220.
The current status of those accounts, is as follows.
(SOR  ¶  1.a.):  This  is  a  bank-issued  home  mortgage  loan  with  a  high  credit  of
$261,506 and an unpaid balance of $244,414 (of which $11,726 was past due), that was

eventually  sold  at  foreclosure  in  June  2016.6  Although  there  was  an  in  personam
deficiency judgment balance of $24,777 against Applicant  as of October 20, 2016,  the
amount was considered by the court to be a marital debt to be paid by Applicant and his
ex-wife.7 Applicant stopped making his monthly payments in July 2015, in anticipation of
a layoff, has not yet made any payments on this account after the foreclosure because
he supposedly had insufficient funds to do so,8 and his ex-wife has avoided paying her
share by filing a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.9
The account has not been resolved.
(SOR  ¶  1.b.):  This  is  a  bank-issued  line  of  credit  with  an  unpaid  and  past-due
balance of $27,059 that was placed for collection and charged off in 2016.10 As with the
home mortgage loan, the amount was considered by the court to be a marital debt to be
paid by Applicant and his ex-wife.11 Applicant’s ex-wife has avoided paying her share by
filing a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Applicant
initially contended that he had entered into an agreement with a particular company that
purchased the account,12 but that payment agreement to which he refers is a credit-card
account  with  the  same  creditor,  in  the  amount  of  $11,674,  that  was  not  alleged  in  the
SOR, which was also considered to be a marital debt to be paid by both Applicant and
his ex-wife.13 Although he said he would reach out to the creditor in an effort to set up
repayment arrangements,14 to date, he has offered no evidence that he has done so.15
The account has not been resolved.
(SOR  ¶¶  1.c.  through  1.e.):  These  are  three  medical  accounts  with  unpaid
balances of $430, $195, and $122 that were placed for collection.16 Applicant paid the
largest and the smallest accounts, for a total of $553, in April 2017,17 and he paid the

remaining account, in the amount of $195, in January 2017.18 The accounts have been
resolved.
In  addition  to  the  delinquent  accounts  alleged  in  the  SOR,  there  are  additional
delinquent accounts not alleged in the SOR19  for which Applicant is either completely or
partially responsible. His divorce decree identified the joint bank-issued credit card with
an unpaid balance of $11,674 which was referred to above for which there is a payment
plan calling for preauthorized monthly payments of $121.60 commencing in April 2017;20
and there is a bank-issued credit card in his ex-wife’s name, also considered a marital
debt, with an unpaid balance of $21,438.21 Applicant referred to other credit cards for both
his ex-wife and himself for which he was making payments, and that he managed to get
one account paid off. He submitted documentation to support his position that one such
past-due  account  for  $2,769  was  settled  in  August  2018  when  he  paid  $830,22  but  he
failed  to  submit  documentation,  such  as  receipts,  letters, cancelled  checks,  or account
statements reflecting either continuing monthly payments or payment plans.
Although Applicant has “definitely been thinking about” financial counseling, he has
never  had  it.23  During  the  hearing,  Applicant  said  his  current  annual  salary  was  over
$120,000.24 After the hearing, he submitted a Personal Financial Statement reflecting a
monthly net income of $7,237; monthly expenses of $5,281; with a monthly remainder of
$1,290 that might be available for discretionary spending or savings.25 However, based
on  the  figures  furnished  by  Applicant,  his  actual  annual  salary  is  approximately
$125,000.26  Among  the  debts  listed  in  his  Personal  Financial  Statement,  Applicant
indicated that he was making monthly payments on four of his current wife’s accounts,

19 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal
Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to
evaluate  an  applicant's  evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to  consider
whether  an  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful  rehabilitation;  (d)  to  decide  whether  a  particular
provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis
under Directive § 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No.
02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also

Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant’s unlisted and unalleged
delinquent accounts will be considered only for the five purposes listed above.

totaling $250; and two of his own accounts, totaling $416. He noted that three accounts
for which his ex-wife was partially responsible were closed as part of her bankruptcy, and
he was not making any payments for them. There is no mention of any monthly payments
of $121 being made on the marital credit card that had an unpaid balance of $21,438.27
In fact, Applicant’s banking and debit card withdrawals and purchases for the period July
26, 2018 through September 24, 2018, while reflecting numerous restaurant expenditures
(often several times in the same day), there is not one payment of $121.28
