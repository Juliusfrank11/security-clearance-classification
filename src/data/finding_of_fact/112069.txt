Applicant, 46, is a systems engineer currently employed by a defense contractor
since January 2014. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from March 1994 until he
retired  in  March  2014.  His  service  included  three  combat  tours,  and  he  received
numerous metals and commendations, including a Bronze Star for meritorious service.
He and his current wife married in 2001. They have four adult children and twins in high
school.  Applicant  was  first  granted  a  security  clearance  in  1994.  (GX  1;  AX  A;  AX  II
through WW; Tr. 14.)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges four debts totaling $36,884 and a Chapter 13
bankruptcy  discharged  in  2006.  Applicant  admits  each  of  these  allegations.  The
delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant’s February 2017 and April 2016 credit bureau
reports (CBR) and discussed during his September 2016 personal subject interview (PSI).
(GX 5; GX 4; GX 2.) Applicant’s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Prior  to  their  marriage  and  2001,  both  Applicant  and  his  wife  individually  filed
Chapter  13  bankruptcy.  (Tr.  59.)  The  bankruptcies  were  discharged  in  2006.  (GX  3.)
Applicant and his wife struggled financially early in their marriage, in part because they
were both active duty and not earning significant salaries, and because of the size of their
household. (Tr. 20.) However, Applicant was promoted and their finances had otherwise
stabilized, so Applicant purchased a boat for $28,694 in April 2008. (GX 4; GX 5; Tr. 35;
Tr. 65.)
Both  Applicant  and  his  wife  testified  that  Applicant’s  wife  is  responsible  for
managing  the  household  finances.  (Tr.  45;  Tr.  60.)  Applicant  attributes  his  financial
difficulties to the combined impact of several events in 2011. Applicant’s wife was eligible
to  retire from  the military  in  2011. They  reviewed  their finances  and determined that  if
Applicant deployed, he would receive greater pay and his wife could retire. She retired in
May  2011.  Applicant’s  wife  was  approved  for  80%  disability  compensation  upon
retirement, but did not start receiving payments until approximately May 2012. Applicant’s
wife’s  reduced  income  and  delayed  disability  compensation  created  greater  financial
strains on the household. (Tr. 59-60.)
Additionally,  the  vehicle  Applicant’s  wife  was  driving  during  this  time  had  major
engine trouble that required repairs that cost $7,000 to $9,000. (Tr. 52; Tr. 27.) Despite
the fact that Applicant had purchased an extended warranty for the vehicle, the dealership
would not honor the warranty. The vehicle underwent several repair attempts, but never
ran  properly,  and  eventually  became  inoperable.  At  some  point,  Applicant  stopped
making payments, and the vehicle was ultimately repossessed. (Tr. 26-28.) The $7,241
balance (SOR ¶ 1.b) was charged-off in March 2012. (GX 4.)
In September 2011, Applicant’s son was in an accident that resulted in third-degree
burns and had to be airlifted to a hospital in another city for medical treatment. Applicant
was deployed and his wife had to travel several hours from their home to see their son in
the hospital. This resulted in travel-related and childcare costs as well as medical bills.
(Tr. 50; GX 2.)
Due  to  the  increased  financial  stressors,  Applicant  fell  behind  on  his  monthly
obligations,  including  his  monthly  boat  payments  of  approximately  $500.  Applicant
attempted  to  negotiate  with  the  creditor,  but  the  creditor  demanded  a  full  lump-sum
payment. Applicant’s last payment on the boat was in September 2011, and the boat was
later voluntarily repossessed. (Tr. 36-37; GX 4.) Applicant believes the boat was sold at
auction. The creditor charged-off the $28,694 original loan amount (SOR ¶ 1.c) in June
2014. (GX 4.) Applicant’s wife testified that the creditor sent Applicant letters attempting
to collect the debt, but because they did not have the money to pay the debt, she did not
respond. (Tr. 70.) She further stated that between 2012 and 2016 she “did not make any
effort to pay the debts . . . we did start making more money in 2014, but honestly it had
been so long that I didn’t make any effort to pay those.” (Tr. 74.)
Applicant discussed his delinquent accounts with the investigator during his PSI in
September  2016.  At  that  time,  Applicant  stated  that  he  did  not  know  the  status  of  the
$7,241  repossessed-vehicle  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  or  the  $28,694  repossessed-boat  debt
(SOR ¶ 1.d) and had not had any contact with the creditors. The investigator confronted
Applicant  with  several  other  delinquent  accounts  including  the  $605  credit-card  debt
(SOR ¶ 1.c) and the $344 cellular telephone debt (SOR ¶ 1.e). Applicant was unaware of
these debts but stated that he would consult his wife, and if the debts were valid, he would
attempt to resolve them within the next 30 days. (GX 2.) In his Answer, Applicant stated
that, “now that we are financially able and I am aware of the repercussions, I intend to
pay these debts.”
Applicant testified that the first time he recalls being aware of his delinquent debts
was in 2016 when reviewing his CBR with the mortgage broker. (Tr. 51-52.) He further
testified that the mortgage broker advised Applicant not to contact the creditors of or to
make  payments  on  the  outstanding  $7,241  repossessed-vehicle  debt  or  the  $28,694
repossessed-boat  debt.  Applicant  explained  that  the  mortgage  broker  stated  that  the
debts were old, but any activity on the accounts could reactivate them, which could result
in a negative impact on Applicant’s credit and ability to qualify for a favorable interest rate.
(Tr.  52-53.)  Applicant  also  stated  that  the  mortgage  broker  told  him  that  paying  the
delinquent  accounts  would  result  in  Applicant’s  not  being  “able   to    purchase   the   home
because   our   credit   rating   would  drop.”  (Tr.  30-31.)  Applicant  opted  not  to  contact  the
creditors. (Tr. 37.)
Applicant received an IRS 1099 C Forgiveness of Debt Form in 2017, and paid the
required tax. (Tr. 45.) Neither Applicant nor his wife specifically recognize the $605 credit-
card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. (Tr. 39; Tr. 69.) The debt was charged off in September
2010.  The  $344  delinquent  cellular  telephone  account  (SOR  ¶  1.e)  was  last  paid  in
September 2009 and transferred to collection in November 2011. (GX 5.) In December
2017 or January 2018, when the initial hearing was pending, Applicant was concerned
about  any  remaining  delinquent  accounts.  He  contacted  the  creditors  of  these  two
accounts  and  paid  them  by  telephone.  (Tr.  39.)  SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  1.c,  and  1.e  have  been
resolved.
Applicant’s  four  character  witnesses,  all  of  whom  hold  security  clearances  and
know Applicant professionally and personally, have served with or worked with Applicant.
The witnesses collectively testified to the strength of Applicant’s character, stating that
Applicant  had  an  outstanding  reputation  of  integrity,  honesty,  trustworthiness,  and
dedication. (Tr. 75-93.) Applicant’s 1997 to 2013 military evaluation reports are positive,
and  his  service  school  academic  evaluations  show  that  he  met  or  exceeded  course
standards. (AX I through FF.) He received the following awards for his military service:
Army Achievement medal 1996, 1999, 2000; Armed Forces Expeditionary medal 1996;
Good Conduct medal 1997, 2003, 2005; Army Commendation medal 2003, 2004, 2008,
2010; Bronze Star medal 2008; and Meritorious Service medal 2013. Applicant’s 2014 to
2017 employee performance reviews show that Applicant met or exceeded performance
expectations  and  that  Applicant  was  a  valuable  team  member  and  a  key  asset  to  the
programs on which he has worked. (AX E through AX H.)
Applicant’s current monthly net income is $4,400, and he and his wife both receive
military retirement and disability compensation payments. Their net monthly household
income is approximately $11,100. (Tr. 41-43.) Applicant and his wife both testified that
they  are  currently  in  a  good  financial  position.  (Tr.  41;  Tr.  67.)  Applicant  purchased  a
house  in  July  2016  with  a  30-year  fixed-rate  mortgage-loan  of  3.75%.1  (Tr.  31.)  His
monthly loan payment as of December 2016 was $2,108. (GX 5.) Applicant did not submit
a written budget, nor is there any reference to maintaining a budget in Applicant’s or his
wife’s  testimony.  Applicant  contributes  $2,000  a  month  to  his  401(k)  and  pays  $6,000
annually for additional medical insurance. Applicant testified that he does not have any
other  delinquent  accounts.  (Tr.  48.)  There  is  no  other  record  evidence  regarding
Applicant’s financial obligations. Neither of the parties submitted a current credit bureau
report.  Applicant  has  not  taken  any  action  to  dispute  his  debts  with  credit  reporting
agencies. (Tr, 45-46.) Applicant does not have a plan to resolve his remaining delinquent
debt.
