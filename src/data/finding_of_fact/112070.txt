Applicant  denies  the  allegations  in  SOR  1.e  ($479)  and  SOR  1.x  ($342).  She
admitted, with explanation, the remaining allegations in SOR paragraphs 1.a through 1.
bb. She was uncertain about the debt in SOR 1.w ($356), asserted she had paid the debts
in SOR 1.m ($167) and SOR 1.t ($1,222), and had payment plans in place for the debts
in  SOR  1.j  ($1497),  SOR  1.k  ($1,222),  SOR  1.u  ($697),  and  SOR  1.v  ($647).  She
provided no documentation showing payment on the debts or copies of the repayment
agreements. After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following
findings of fact
Applicant is a 40-year-old systems engineer working for a defense contractor since
May  2001.  (Tr.  18)  She  seeks  to  retain  a  security  clearance.  Her  annual  salary  is
approximately $124,000. (Tr. 59) Her duty performance during the more than 17 year of
2  Executive  Order  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified  Information  within  Industry  (February  20,  1960),  as
amended;  DoD  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review  Program
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (Sept. 1, 2006 AG) effective
within the DoD on September 1, 2006.
3 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my decision in
this case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/5220-6 R20170608.pdf.
working for the defense contractor has been outstanding. Between August 2004 and June
2017, she received numerous awards at work, which totaled in excess of $4,000. (Ex. E,
Ex  M)  Since  2003,  her  work  performance  has  met  or  exceeded  her  employer’s
expectations.  For  the  last five  years,  her  performance has  been  rated  as  exceeded  or
significantly exceeded. (Ex. L) In 2018, Applicant received an award in recognition of her
accomplishments in science, technology, engineering and mathematics community. (Ex.
N) She received the outstanding achievement award as a technology raising star. (Ex. N)
In January 2015, Applicant married. Her husband’s annual salary is approximately
$45,000 and he has worked for a government contractor since 2007. (Tr. 60, 64) He has
additional jobs: one as a referee, a second as a DJ, and does production work. (Tr. 62,
64) The net monthly household take-home income is approximately $5,000. (Tr. 55) In
May 2000, Applicant received her Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering.
In August 2005, she received her Master of Science degree in system engineering. She
married in January 2015 and has a 19-year-old, who is a college student, a 7 year old,
and a 10-year-old stepson. (Tr. 21) Her stepson lives with his mother.
On  Applicant’s  February  2013  Electronic  Questionnaires  for  Investigations
Processing (e-QIP) she listed a single medical debt of $919. (Ex. 1) She stated she was
working with the creditor and would be setting up a monthly payment to resolve the debt.
Her February 2018 credit report listed six delinquent obligations: SOR 1.b ($11,724), SOR
1.c ($11,436), SOR 1.d ($8,245), SOR 1.f ($972), SOR 1.g ($297), and SOR 1.j ($497).
These six obligations total $33,171. She asserted she had a debt payoff plan to address
24 delinquent obligations listed. The payoff plan would address $40,230 in debt.
The payoff plan was scheduled to start in June 2018, three months following the
hearing, and anticipated to end in May 2019.The payoff plan estimated she which would
pay  off  the  debt  in  SOR  1.j  ($497)  in  September  2018,  the  debt  in  SOR  1.g  ($528)  in
November 2018, and the debts in SOR 1.b ($12,377), 1.c ($11,437), and 1.d ($8,245)
would be paid in May 2019. (Ex. K) The plan also includes paying off 12 medical debts
and seven other debts in additional to the five debts previously listed. (Ex. K) Applicant
did not provide any documentation showing that payments had been made in accord with
the plan.
Applicant  experienced  financial  difficulties  while  a  single  mother  raising  her
daughter. She was not receiving financial assistance from her daughter’s father. (Tr. 17,
23)  At  that  time,  her  student  loans  (SOR  1.a,  $43,000  and  SOR  1.bb).had  been  in
deferment status since 2010. (Tr. 24) She had paid $200 monthly on her student loans
until they went into deferment status. (Tr. 25) When her deferment ended she expected
to receive a letter from the company from which she obtained her student loans. (Tr. 25)
She did not know the loans had been transferred to another company for collection. (Tr.
17) She received letters from the company then holding the student loan notes, but did
not respond to the letters wrongfully assuming the letters were letters of solicitation from
a company wishing to consolidate her student loan with that company. (SOR Response)
She  did  not  believe  the  collection  letters  came  from  a  company  that  held  her  student
loans.
In June 2014, Applicant’s wages were garnished to collect the funds she owed on
her  student  loans.  She  was  unaware  of  the  transfer  until  her  wages  were  involuntarily
garnished  in  the  amount  of  $1,200  monthly.  This  amount  was  more  than  her  monthly
mortgage  payments.  She  was  unsuccessful  in  attempting  to  have  the  amount  of  the
weekly  garnishment  lowered.  The  garnishment  was  15  percent  of  her  wages.  (Tr.  27)
While the garnishment was in place, she was unable to address any of her other debt.
(Tr. 17)
In  December  2017,  the  last  amount  owed  on  Applicant  student  loans  was
garnished from her wages. (Ex. J) Her student loan debt of $43,000 was then completely
paid by the garnishment. (Tr. 28) Her February 2018 credit report lists a zero balance on
her  state  guaranteed student  loans  and  her  educational financial accounts.  (Ex.4)  Her
October 2015 credit report listed $38,237 in student loans. (Ex. 2) While her wages were
being garnished, she was unable to address many of her financial obligations.
Applicant had a $12,377 vehicle purchase account (SOR 1.b) charged off. In April
2016, a hailstorm “totaled” the vehicle. (Tr. 32) Her insurance coverage paid $5,000 on
the vehicle. She did not have gap insurance resulting in the $12,377 debt. (Tr. 33) She
was  unable  to  address  this  debt  while  the  garnishment  was  in  place.  Now  that  the
garnishment  has  ended,  she  has  $1,200  monthly  to  address  her  other  delinquent
accounts. (Tr. 50) She asserts she intends to start addressing her delinquent debts. She
provided the payoff plan with payments to start in June 2018.
Applicant  incurred  an  $11,4374  collection  account  (SOR  1.c).  She  is  current  on
another  loan  with  the  same  creditor  that  has  a  loan  balance  of  approximately  $4,000.
Once that loan is paid, she asserted she will commence paying this debt. (Tr. 34) She
had a line of credit that resulted in the bank charging off $8,245 (SOR 1.d). She also had
a  $972  credit  card  account  (SOR  1.f)  that  was  also  charged  off.  (Tr.  37)  In  her  SOR
Response, she indicated a repayment plan had been established to pay the debt. She
also stated in her SOR Response that “payment mitigation plans” had been set up with
the creditors in: SOR 1.h, SOR 1.i, SOR 1, j, SOR 1.k, SOR 1.m. SOR 1.n, SOR 1.o, SOR
1.t, SOR 1.u, SOR 1.v, SOR 1.w, SOR 1.y, SOR 1.z, and SOR 1.aa. The accounts went
delinquent in 2009 or 2010, before the garnishment started. (Tr. 37) The accounts when
delinquent at the time her daughter’s father stopped providing child support.
In Applicant’s May 2017 SOR Response, she stated the debts in SOR 1.q ($60),
SOR 1.r ($35), and SOR 1.s ($35) had been paid, but provided no documentation showing
payment had been made. (SOR Response) In her response, she indicated the following
delinquent  obligations  would  be  paid  by  December  2017:  SOR  1.w  ($356),  SOR  1.y
($227), SOR 1.z ($194), and SOR 1.aa ($125). (SOR Response) No documentation was
received  showing  payment  had  been  made  on  these  debts.  These  four  medical  debts
appear in her payoff plan showing she intended to pay the debts in June 2018, July 2018,
and August 2018. (Ex. J)
4 The collection account in SOR 1.c was listed as “$11,4377.” Department Counsel moved to amend the
amount to $11,437. (Tr. 8) There being no objection, the amount was changed.
In May 2017, when Applicant responded to the SOR, she stated she was unfamiliar
with the $479 past-due account (SOR 1.e). (Tr. 37) She had a $528 credit card account
(SOR  1.g)  charged  off.  The  credit  card  was  used  to  purchase  school  clothes  for  her
daughter in 2014. (Tr. 39) Her February 2018 credit report indicates a balance of $297
showing she has made some payments on the debt. (Ex. 4) She had a $507 collection
account (SOR 1.h) for a home improvement store. (Tr. 40) It is part of a repayment plan
she intends to start. (Tr. 41) She plans on starting to pay her smaller debts and allow the
“snowball effect” to help her address her delinquent accounts. (Tr. 41)
Applicant  owed  approximately  $2,200  on  12  delinquent  medical  debts:  SOR  1.i
($499), SOR 1.l ($379), SOR 1.n ($149), 1.o ($144), SOR 1.p ($60), SOR 1.q ($60), SOR
1.r  ($35), SOR 1.s  ($1),  SOR  1.w  ($356), SOR 1.y  ($277),  SOR  1.z  ($194),  and  SOR
1.aa ($125). She had health insurance and assumed her insurance company would have
paid these medical debts for surgery received. (Tr. 42) She asserted that in April 2017,
she made a repayment plan with one of the creditors and made a payment on the plan.
(Tr.  41)  She  has  not  made  any  additional  payments.  She  was  unfamiliar  with  these
medical debts. She was the victim of identity theft and wanted to make sure the debts
were valid. (Tr. 44) She believes she has paid some of these medical debts. (Tr. 46)
Applicant learned that her identity had been stolen when she attempted to file her
taxes one year and was told her tax return had already been filed. (Tr. 51) It took nine
months to resolve the problem. She has been on a fraud alert with one of the major credit
reporting agencies. (Tr. 52) When credit inquiries are made, she receives notification of
the  inquiry.  She  provided  no  additional  information  has  to  how  the  identity  theft  has
affected  her  finances.  In  her  SOR  Response  she  denied  two  of  the  SOR  debts  and
admitted, sometimes with explanation, the other 26 SOR delinquent obligations.
Applicant owed a $497 collection balance on a department store account (SOR
1.j).  (Tr.  41)  She  owed  $405  on  another  credit  card  collection  account  (SOR  1.k)  in
collection.  She  owed $697 on  a  telephone company  collection  account  (SOR  1.u)  and
$647 on an electrical bill collection debt (SOR 1.v). (Tr. 47) She has included these four
debts in her repayment plan. (Tr. 42) She disputes a debt with the bottled water company
(SOR 1.m, $167). (Tr. 43) In December 2017, she asserts the cable television collection
account (SOR 1.t, $1,222) was paid. (Tr. 47) She disputes a $342 insurance collection
debt (SOR 1.x, $342) since she never had insurance with the company. (Tr. 48)
At some period of time not set forth in the record, Applicant sought the services of
a  credit  correction  company  who  sent  letters  on  her  behalf disputing  each  of  the SOR
debts.  (Tr.  49)  She  employed  the  credit  correction  company  to  assist  her  in  having
delinquent  accounts  removed  from  her  credit  report.  She  had  34  negative  accounts
removed5 from her credit report. (Ex. F) There is no indication she made any payment on
the negative accounts. Her credit score was 602 indicating her credit was “fair.” (Ex. F)
5 The removal of debts supposedly includes the debt in SOR 1.c ($11,436). The credit collection company’s
information indicates this debt was to be removed in August 2017 and October 2017. However, the debt
still appears on her February 2018 credit report and appears as a debt to be paid in her payoff plan. (Ex. F,
Ex. J, and Ex. 4)
Nor did she indicate which, if any, of the removed accounts were listed as SOR delinquent
obligations. The document from the credit collection company indicates that should she,
fail to pay a credit or charge card bill, bounce a check, or miss payments on
other credit related bills, the issuer may continue in house collection efforts
or send you overdue bill to a third pay collection agency, a company that
will then attempt to obtain payment from you. (Ex. F)
Applicant now monitors her finances to the penny. (Tr. 53) She has approximately
$128,000 in her 401(k) retirement plan. (Tr. 54) Her husband has approximately $20,000
in his 401(k) retirement plan. (Tr. 65) She pays $1,100 monthly on her mortgage for the
house she has lived in since 2003. (Tr. 55) She is current on her monthly car payment
($500) and truck payment ($700). (Tr. 56) Both vehicle were purchased used.
Applicant’s husband believes they are getting back on track and believes the future
is  “a  whole  lot  brighter.”  (Tr.  63)  They  had  a  plan  to  address  their  debts  which  was
interrupted  by  the  garnishment.  (Tr.  63)  They  have  read  books  on  financial  planning,
talked with their pastor, and listened to the Dave Ramsey radio show about implementing
the financial planning techniques set forth in the Financial Peace University. (Tr. 63) They
now take time to evaluate their situation before making a financial decision. (Tr. 64) In
August 2017, her mother died and she paid expenses from her death. (Ex. G)
Applicant testified at her hearing that her approach to her finances has changed,
as follows:
We have been, you know, kind of lackadaisical in our approach to paying
off previous debts, but now that we are fully aware that it affects my job, that
we have been aggressively trying to get these [her delinquent debts] to zero.
(Tr. 73)
Applicant  made  five  payments,  which  totaled  approximately  $6,500,  for  her
daughter’s tuition. (Ex. H) Three of the payments, which totaled $3,166, occurred after
the hearing. In addition to paying her daughter’s tuition, she provided documentation that
she made five payments to creditors that totaled $180. (Ex. I) In May and June 2018, she
made two payments of $25.37 each to the creditor of the SOR 1.h debt ($507). (Ex. I) In
May 2018, she made a $19.82 payment to a creditor. In May and June 2018, she made
two payments of $55 each to a creditor, but failed to indicate to which SOR debt it applied.
(Ex. I) She stopped making payments to these three creditors when she found out her
daughter’s tuition would not be fully funded. (Ex. G)
