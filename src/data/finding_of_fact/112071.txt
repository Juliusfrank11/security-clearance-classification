In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.r and 4.b, and she denied
the  other  SOR  allegations.  She  also  provided  extenuating  and  mitigating  information.
Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.
Applicant is 42 years old, and a DOD contractor employs her as a management
specialist in Afghanistan. (Tr. 29, 88, 90) She served in the Army from 1996 to 2000, and
she received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 89-90) In 2006, she received an associate’s
degree. (GE 1)
In 1999, Applicant married, and in September 2016, her divorce was final. (Tr. 89)
Her three children are teenagers. (Tr. 89) In August 2014, Applicant filed for divorce. (Tr.
50, 57) She paid “well over $30,000” to her divorce attorney. (Tr. 51) She received security
training in 2012. (AE SR R)
Financial Considerations
While  Applicant  was  deployed  to  Afghanistan,  she  believed  her  husband  was
paying the family bills, and she was unaware of the delinquent SOR debts. (Tr. 52) After
she learned of her delinquent debts, she reduced her expenses, especially her rent. (Tr.
53) She cashed in her 401(k) account to pay her debts. (Tr. 54) She paid all of the SOR
debts; however, she noted the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a for $1,438 is still listed as delinquent on
her current credit report. (Tr. 16, 37, 55) The status and disposition of the debts alleged
on the SOR are as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a charged-off debt for $1,438. On June 7, 2018, Applicant paid
the creditor $1,000, and the debt was settled. (AE B; AE SR S) However, on September
1, 2018, Applicant emailed that her credit report had not been updated to reflect resolution
of this debt. (SOR response) I have credited her with resolving this debt.
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.h, and 1.l allege telecommunications debts placed for collection for
$783, $173, and $783. On May 16, 2018, Applicant paid the SOR ¶ 1.b creditor $783.
(AE C at 1; AE SR D) On May 14, 2018, Applicant paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h. (AE SR N;
AE C at 26) The accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.l reflect the same debt. (SOR response)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a charged-off debt for $599. On May 18, 2018, the creditor wrote
Applicant’s debt was paid in full as of January 13, 2016. (AE C at 23-24)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges an account placed for collection for $588. On May 24, 2018, the
creditor wrote that the debt was resolved, and the balance owed was zero. (AE C at 13)
SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.i, 1.j, 1.p, and 1.q allege six delinquent medical debts for $572,
$360, $92, $1,572, $165, and $165. SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.i, 1.j, 1.p, and 1.q do not allege
specific creditors seeking payment of the medical debts. On May 14, 2018, Applicant paid
a medical collection debt of unspecified amount. (AE SR O; AE C at 12) On May 15, 2018,
Applicant  paid  the  creditor  in  SOR  ¶  1.j  $1,572.  (AE  C  at  7)  The  creditor  provided  an
undated letter stating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.p and 1.q were paid by insurance. (AE SR
P; AE SR H; AE C at 25) On May 15, 2018, Applicant received an email indicating her 12
medical debts for $1,589, $595, $1,633, $91, $100, $3,145, $339, $83, $190, $190, $85,
and $24, were being paid in full. (AE C at 29-43)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges a debt placed for collection for $350. On September 1, 2018,
Applicant indicated in an email that the creditor had closed the account and would not
accept payment. (SOR response)
SOR ¶ 1.k alleges an account placed for collection for $1,255. On May 14, 2018,
Applicant paid $1,255 to the creditor. (AE C at 28; AE SR C)
SOR ¶ 1.m alleges an account placed for collection for $539. On May 24, 2018,
the creditor wrote that Applicant’s debt was resolved, and the balance owed was zero.
(AE C at 10)
SOR ¶ 1.n alleges a charged-off debt for $486. On May 24, 2018, the creditor wrote
Applicant’s account was resolved, and the balance owed was zero. (AE SR J)
SOR ¶ 1.o alleges an account placed for collection for $468. On May 24, 2018, the
creditor wrote that Applicant’s debt was resolved, and the balance owed was zero. (AE C
at 8)
SOR ¶ 1.r alleges Applicant’s pay was garnished to address a student loan debt
for $8,777. On May 15, 2018, a student loan creditor wrote a defaulted student loan of
unspecified  amount  was  paid  in  full  in  August  2012.  (AE  C  at  3)  On  June  7,  2018,
Applicant  paid a  student  loan for $2,505.  (AE  C at  6)  On  July  3,  2018,  a  student  loan
creditor  wrote  that five  student  loans of  $5,500, $3,387,  $2,750,  $208,  and  $758  were
paid in full. (AE C at 15-22) On January 7, 2019, three student loans for $3,353, $7,326,
and $5,500 were paid in full. (AE C at 4-5)
Applicant did not include her income of about $5,000 from customers seeking her
time and other personal services on her 2016 federal income tax return. In ISCR Case
No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances
in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:
(a)  to  assess  an  applicant’s  credibility;  (b)  to  evaluate  an  applicant’s
evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to
consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;
(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is
applicable;  or  (e)  to  provide  evidence  for  whole  person  analysis  under
Directive Section 6.3.
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-
0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd.
April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR
Case  No.  03-20327  at  4  (App.  Bd.  Oct.  26,  2006)).  I  limited  my  consideration  of
Applicant’s admission that she did not declare income from her customers in violation of
the Internal Revenue Code to the five purposes listed above.
Criminal Conduct, Sexual Behavior, and Personal Conduct
SOR  ¶¶  2.a,  3.a,  and  4.a  allege  that  Applicant  was  cited  in  March  2017  for
prostitution  and  operating  a  business  without  a  city  license.  SOR  ¶  4.b  alleges  and
Applicant admitted that she failed to timely report this citation to her security officer. (SOR
response) Applicant did not report her arrest because her attorney told her not to do so
because “it would implicate [her] in a crime.” (Tr. 76)
In March 2017, the police arrested Applicant at her residence. (Tr. 71) Applicant
said she was not charged with operating a business without a license, and the prostitution
charge was dismissed because of lack of evidence that she engaged in prostitution. (Tr.
75;  SOR  response,  Order  Dismissing  Charge)  After  her  arrest,  she  stopped  seeking
customers on a dating website. (Tr. 78, 81) After her Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), she reported the arrest to her security officer. (Tr.
76-77) Applicant’s counsel indicated the prostitution charge was a municipal violation and
not a violation of state law. (Tr. 16-17) In Applicant’s state of residence, prostitution is a
class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $500.
Under  the  statute  in  Applicant’s  state,  §  567.020,  “A  person  commits  the  offense  of
prostitution if he or she engages in or offers or agrees to engage in sexual conduct with
another person in return for something of value to be received by any person.”
Applicant believed her husband called the police and alleged she was engaged in
prostitution. (Tr. 80; SR) Applicant criticized the credibility of a police officer involved in
the investigation of her prostitution charge. (Tr. 17-19) Her counsel cited a 2015 Eighth
Circuit  decision  that  named  the  police  officer  as  having  omitted  information  from  an
affidavit used to obtain a search warrant. (AE D) The magistrate noted information was
omitted; however, the magistrate concluded that  “the officer did not act intentionally or
recklessly to mislead the issuing judge.” (AE D at 2) The district court judge agreed with
the magistrate. (AE D at 2-3) The Eighth Circuit found the omissions were negligent but
otherwise  agreed  the  omissions  were  not  made  with  deliberate  falsity  or  reckless
disregard, and declined to suppress the product of the search. (AE D at 4, 6) Applicant
also provided a copy of a 2014 deposition of the same police officer relating to an alleged
stalking  incident  the  police  officer  investigated  in  2012.  (AE  D)  Applicant  asserted  the
police officer admitted in the deposition that he made a false statement in his investigation
of the stalking allegation. (Tr. 17-20) Applicant and her former husband were not involved
in the alleged stalking incident. (AE D)
Applicant’s  concerns  about  the  officer’s  credibility  have  low  relevance  because
Applicant  did  not  contest  most  of  the  material  facts  in  the  police  report.  The  only
information  Applicant  challenged  were  the  allegations,  as  summarized  by  the  police
officer,  of  the  two  witnesses  who  said  Applicant  provided  sex  to  them  in exchange for
their  payments  of  the  amounts  specified  on  Applicant’s  Internet  advertisement.  (SOR
Report) Written statements from the two witnesses were not included in the file. The two
witnesses were soldiers at a nearby military base, and Applicant’s counsel said he was
unable to locate them. Applicant’s admissions at her hearing, and the advertisement and
pictures from the website are sufficient to establish the allegation of prostitution under the
substantial evidence standard.
SOR ¶¶ 3.b, 3.c, 3.d, and 4.a allege Applicant engaged in sex with strangers that
she  met  on  websites,  including  a  dating  website  with  a  history  of  being  involved  with
prostitution. Her website posting indicated she charged $80 for 30 minutes and $150 for
60 minutes. At least one man that she met online paid her $80 following sex.
For about one year from 2016 to 2017, Applicant’s semi-nude photographs and
contact information were placed on a dating or escort website. (Tr. 60-63, 68-70; GE 5)
Her time was available for $80 for 30 minutes and $150 for 60 minutes. (Tr. 61-63) She
offered conversation, warmth, massage, dance, and  a special event to her customers.
(Tr.  61-62,  74)  In  April  2018,  the  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ)  issued  a  press  release
indicating the website Applicant was using to solicit customers was seized, as it was “the
dominant marketplace for illicit commercial sex, a place where sex traffickers frequently
advertised children and adults alike.” (Tr. 77; GE 9)
On  March  11,  2017,  the  police  stopped  a  vehicle  that  had  just  left  Applicant’s
residence. (GE 4) The driver was a soldier at a nearby military installation. The driver said
he had just paid Applicant $80 for sex. He said he also paid her $150 for sex on March 8,
2017. (OPM ROI at 17) The police went to Applicant’s residence and asked for the money
the witness paid her, and she provided four $20 bills. Id. Applicant told the police that she
was  not  engaging  in  prostitution.  The  police  interviewed  another  witness  who  was  a
soldier at a nearby military installation, and he said he paid for sex about four times at
Applicant’s residence. Id. (police report) Applicant’s lawyer said he was unable to locate
the two witnesses cited in the police report to challenge their credibility. (Tr. 45-46) When
Applicant  was  questioned  by  the  police,  she  “was  concerned  about  the  charge  of
prostitution as it would affect her security clearance.” (GE 4)
Applicant had difficulty estimating how many people paid her for her time; however,
she estimated “at least see[ing] 40 or more.” (Tr. 64-66) She estimated that she had sex
with about 20 men. (Tr. 66-67) She was vague about how many of them paid after having
sex with her. (Tr. 67-68) Some of the customers may have asked her for drugs; however,
she always refused to give them drugs. (Tr. 88) Applicant did not have anyone to protect
her if the date with her customers became violent. (Tr. 87)
Applicant consistently denied that she engaged in prostitution. (Tr. 43, 47-48) She
denied that there was a direct relationship between the payment of funds and the sexual
activity.  (Tr.  82;  SR;  GE  2)  The  purpose  of  the  semi-nudity  on  her  webpage  was  to
encourage  men  to  call  her  to  go  out  with  her.  (Tr.  70)  After  the  first  date,  some  men
continued their relationships with her and continued to pay her, and some did not pay her.
(Tr.  71,  82)  As  for  whether  she  was  soliciting  prostitution,  Applicant  explained,  in  an
advertisement a girl holding a soda may be wearing a bikini, “but that doesn’t mean she’s
a prostitute.” (Tr. 93) Applicant held a security clearance in the 2016 to 2017 time period
when her webpage advertised her time to customers. (Tr. 75)
Applicant’s  spouse  was  vindictive  towards  her  because  of  her  conduct.  Her
husband placed her pictures on a bad website to damage her reputation. (Tr. 38-42, 61;
SOR  response;  GE  5)  In  2016,  he  called  her  a  prostitute  at  a  basketball  game  their
children were attending. (Tr. 39-40) He threatened to seek her conviction and sentencing
to jail for prostitution. (Tr. 39) He sought an order barring her from seeing her children;
however, the judge denied his motion, and he had to pay her attorney fees. (Tr. 40) Her
husband encouraged the police to investigate Applicant for engaging in prostitution. (Tr.
41)
Applicant conceded that she “presented [herself] in the wrong manner as far as
that  [she]  may  have  been  doing  an  illegal  action.”  (Tr.  80)  At  the  time  Applicant  was
utilizing  the  webpage  to  solicit  customers,  she  had  full-time  employment  and  earned
$53,500 annually. (Tr. 84) In 2016, she made a little more than $5,000 from the website.
(Tr. 85) She did not include the income from the customers on her federal tax return for
tax year 2016. (Tr. 85-86)
Character Evidence
In 2018, Applicant received two promotions and a certificate of appreciation from
her  employer.  (Tr.  50)  She  served  in  Afghanistan  in  2014,  and  she  was  serving  in
Afghanistan at the time of her hearing. (Tr. 48)
Applicant’s program manager has known her since 2000. (Tr. 28-29) He described
her as an excellent employee who is conscientious, reliable, and responsible. (Tr. 30-31)
She did not commit any security or rule violations. (Tr. 36) He supported her for positions
of greater responsibility and a security clearance. (Tr. 32-33)
