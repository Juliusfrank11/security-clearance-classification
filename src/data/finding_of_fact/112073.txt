Applicant admitted both of the SOR allegations. He is 49 years old. He married in
1991, divorced in 1995, remarried in 1996, divorced in 2011, and remarried in 2011. He
has  three  children:  one  is  an  adult  from  his  second  marriage,  and  the  other  two  are
minors from his current marriage.1
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  1987,  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in
1992, and earned a juris doctorate degree in 1995. He worked in state law enforcement
from around 2001 to 2007, and he has since served as a reserve officer. He has worked
for various DOD contractors since 2008. As of the date of the hearing, he worked as a
division vice president for a DOD contractor since January 2018. He has never held a
security clearance.2
The SOR alleges a delinquent consumer account for $5,709 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and a
state tax lien from December 2006 for $31,253 (SOR ¶ 1.b). SOR ¶ 1.a is established
by a 2017 credit bureau report. Applicant disclosed and discussed SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b
in his 2015 security clearance application (SCA), 2016 background interview, and 2017
response to interrogatories.3
SOR  ¶  1.a  is  for  the  outstanding  balance  on  an  apartment  lease  placed  in
collection for $5,709. Applicant and his wife broke their lease seven months early. She
unexpectedly  became  pregnant  with  their  second  child  in  2013  and  they  decided  they
needed to rent a bigger place. Prior to breaking the lease, he unsuccessfully attempted
to  work  with  the  apartment  company  to  resolve  the  outstanding  balance,  but  was  told
there was nothing that could be done and his balance would be placed in collection.4

In  2014,  Applicant  unsuccessfully  attempted  to  work  with  the  collection  agency
when he received a demand letter for payment. The collection agency only wanted a full
or  a  half  payment,  which  he  could  not  then  afford.  He  paid  a  security  deposit  and  the
first and last month’s rent on his new rental; he was paying child support for his eldest
child; and he was ensuring that his mortgage on his home, as further discussed below,
remained current. He stopped trying to work with the collection agency in 2014, when it
threatened  to  sue  him.  Between  2014  and  2017,  he  received  telephone  calls  from  the
collection agency demanding payment in full, which he still could not then afford.5
In December 2017, Applicant contacted the collection agency to try to resolve the
debt.  He  was  motivated,  in  part,  from  having  received  the  August  2017  SOR.  He
managed to rebuild his credit, and he had a credit card that he could use to resolve the
debt.  He  also  had  enough  money  in  his  401k  retirement  account  that  he  could  use,  if
necessary. He sought to pay in full with his credit card, only to learn that the collection
agency  stopped  accepting  any  payments  from  his  credit-card  company.  In  May  2018,
he resolved the account in full with a loan from his 401k retirement account.6
SOR  ¶  1.b  is  for  a  $31,253  state  tax  lien  entered  against  Applicant  in  2006.
Applicant attributed the lien to incorrect advice that he and his parents received from a
certified public accountant (CPA) in 2003. In around 2000, his parents put his name on
their home; the home was fully paid, he was living in it, and they retired and wanted to
move elsewhere. When he sold the home in 2003 and gave the money to his parents,
the CPA advised him that he would not have to pay taxes on the proceeds from the sale
of the home.7
In  2006,  Applicant  received  a  letter  from  the  IRS  and  the  state  Department  of
Revenue (DOR), informing him that he owed back taxes on the sale of the home in the
amounts of approximately $60,000 to the IRS and $30,000 to the state DOR, for a total
of  $90,000.  He  could  not  then  afford  to  pay  the  back  taxes,  as  he  earned  $30,000
annually working as a state police officer and his then-wife was a bank teller. The IRS
and  the  state  consequently  placed  tax  liens  on  his  home,  which  he  and  his  first  wife
purchased in 2004, effectively preventing him from selling it. His ability to sell the home
was  further  hampered  when  the  economic  downturn  affected  its  value  from  2006
through 2010.8
Applicant  testified  that  his  and  his  then-wife’s  yearly  federal  income  tax  refunds
from  2006  to  2017,  totaling  approximately  $5,000  to  $10,000,  were  applied  to  the
$60,000  in  back  taxes  owed  to  the  IRS,  and  the  IRS  released  its  lien  in  2016.  He
testified that his yearly state income tax refunds from 2006 to 2009,9 and his then-wife’s

yearly  state  tax  refunds  from  2006  to  2014,  totaling  approximately  $3,000  to  $5,000,
were applied to the $30,000 in back taxes owed to the state DOR. He testified that the
state has not made any efforts to collect on its lien since 2014. He hired an attorney in
2017  to  assist  him  with  resolving  the  outstanding  state  tax  lien,  though  she  had  been
advising him since the lien was placed against his home in 2006 because he has known
her  for  a  long  time  both  professionally  and  personally.  He  testified  that  his  attorney
advised  him  against  setting  up  a  payment  plan  for  the  back  taxes  when  his  and  his
then-wife’s federal and state income tax refunds were being intercepted, since the IRS
and  the  state  DOR  already  placed  a  lien  against  his  property  and  he  could  not  then
afford a payment plan; he testified that he also did not attempt an offer-in-compromise
(OIC) because he could not then afford a sufficient offer amount to do so.10
In 2017, Applicant started to see value return to his home, and he had $50,000 in
equity in it as of the date of the hearing. However, he testified that he had not listed the
home  for  sale  because  the  existing  lien  would  prevent  him from  securing  a buyer.  His
attorney  advised  him  that  his  best  course  of  action  is  to  find  a  qualified  buyer  who  is
aware  of  the  lien  on  the  home;  notify  the  state  DOR  that  they  have  a  qualified  buyer;
negotiate with the state DOR on an OIC for the outstanding state tax lien; and use the
proceeds  from  the  sale  of  the  home  to  resolve  the  negotiated  OIC  for  the  lien.  He
intends  to  follow  his  attorney’s  advice.  His  attorney  is  assisting  him  with  finding  a
qualified buyer for the home. His prior renter from 2015 to 2018 desired to purchase the
home,  but  she  ultimately  did  not  qualify  for  financing.  His  current  renter  desires  to  get
prequalified  to  purchase  the  home,  but  her  efforts  are  at  a  standstill  until  her  pending
divorce  is  final.  He  believed  the  balance  on  the  state  tax  lien  as  of  the  date  of  the
hearing was approximately $50,000 to $60,000, with penalties and interest.11
Applicant’s  household  annual  income  was  $254,000  as  of  the  date  of  the
hearing. His wife started working as a teacher in 2018. In 2008, his annual income was
approximately $78,000; in 2009, it was $90,000; in 2012 it was $150,000; in 2015 it was
$170,000;  and  in  2016  it  was  $185,000.  He  has  approximately  $8,000  in  savings  and
$30,000 in his 401k retirement account. After his income and expenses, his monthly net
remainder is approximately $1,000. He testified that he has timely filed his federal and
state income tax returns. He does not have any other delinquent debts. He is current on
his  expenses,  to  include  his  mortgage  of  $1,000  monthly  and  repayment  of  his  401(k)
loan. Other than the financial advice given to him by his attorney, he has not received
financial counseling.12
Two former supervisors described Applicant as an exemplary worker and a man
of  professional  integrity.  Applicant’s  landlord  from  2016  to  at  least  2018,  who  also
considered Applicant a friend, attested to Applicant’s timely rental payments as well as
10 Tr. at 27-35, 43-56, 66-77; GE 1, 2, 3; AE A, B, E.
11 Tr. at 27-35, 43-56, 66-77; GE 1, 2, 3; AE A, B, E.

his  trustworthiness  and  unquestionable  ethics.  Other  character  references  also
described Applicant as a responsible and diligent individual.13
