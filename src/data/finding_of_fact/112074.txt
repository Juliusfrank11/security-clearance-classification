Applicant  is  a  43-year-old  employee  of  a  Department  of  Defense  contractor
seeking to maintain a security clearance. He has worked for his current employer since
August  2017.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  October  1994  to
December  2003.  He  separated  as  an  E-5  with  an  honorable  discharge.  Between
December 2010  and December 2011,  Applicant  was  unemployed.  In  2010, he  lost  his
job as a result of a reckless driving offense, which resulted in him serving 15 days in jail.
During  this  period  of  unemployment,  he  lived  off  savings  and  took  college  courses.
Between  2011  and  2018,  he  served  in  the  Air  National  Guard.  He  has  worked  for
various  DoD  contractors  as  well  as  other  jobs.  He  is  a  high  school  graduate,  has
attended college courses, but does not have a degree. He is single and has no children.
(Tr. 32- 38; Gov 1; Gov 2; Gov 9)
Applicant  has  held  security  clearances  in  the  past.  On  February  4,  2000,  the
Army  issued  an  SOR  and  notified  Applicant  of  their  intent  to  deny  his  access  to
sensitive  compartmented  information  (SCI)  and  classified  information  for  financial
reasons.  Applicant submitted a response to the SOR. Based on his answer, the Army
Central Clearance Facility (CCF) reinstated his security clearance and access to SCI on
June  7,  2000.  The  Army  CCF  warned  Applicant  that  retention  of  his  SCI  access
eligibility and security clearance was contingent upon Applicant not incurring any further
financial  mismanagement  or  other  personal  behavior  that  would  render  him  ineligible.
(Gov 8)
On  February  14,  2016,  Applicant  submitted  a  security  clearance  application  as
part of a periodic reinvestigation. In  “Section 26 – Financial Record” of the application,
he disclosed a delinquent debt owed to a homeowner’s association; delinquent student
loans;  a  delinquent  car  loan;  and  a  delinquent  military  exchange  account.  (Gov  1,
section 26)
A  subsequent  security  clearance  background  investigation  resulted  in  the
following  SOR  allegations:  failure  to  file  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for  tax
years 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a: Gov 2 at 10, 15);  a delinquent federal
tax debt in the amount of $7,561 for tax year 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.b: Gov 2 at 10, 15, 19); a
$995 delinquent state income tax debt for tax year 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.c: AE A at 6, 13, 14,
36);  a  mortgage  account  that  was  delinquent  in  the  amount  of  $3,596,  with  an
approximate total balance of $287,763 (SOR ¶ 1.d: Gov 1 at 11; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 7);
a $5,065 judgment from a home owner’s association filed in October 2014  (SOR ¶ 1.e:
Gov 1 at 12; Gov 4 at 4); a $2,830 judgment filed in May 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.f: Gov 1 at 10;
Gov 4 at 4); a $6,917 charged-off car loan (SOR ¶ 1.g: Gov 1 at 2; Gov 3 at 2); and a
$2,948 charged-off account motorcycle loan. (SOR ¶ 1.h: Gov 3 at 2).
Applicant admits that he did not file his federal and state income tax returns for
tax  years  2012,  2013,  2014,  and  2015.  Applicant  states  that  he  got  into  tax  problems
because of financial problems from being unemployed, trying to maintain his mortgage
payments, and the stress from his mother and his guardian both suffering from terminal
illnesses  at  the  same  time.  Applicant  testified  he  was  stressed  out  about  his  mother’s
illness. He focused on his mother, forgot about paying bills, and did not pay attention to
the mail.  His mother passed away in 2016. (Tr. 39-40; Gov 2)
Applicant’s federal income tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015 were
filed  on  March  11,  2017,  a  few  days  before  submitting  his  answer  to  DOHA
interrogatories on March 13, 2017.  In his answer to interrogatories, Applicant stated: “I
do  intend  to  pay  all  the  monies  owed  to  the  IRS  with  the  payment  plan,  as  discussed
with  the  IRS.  I  plan  on  filing  on  time  this  year  for  my  2016  taxes.  Please  allow  me  to
remedy these issues; I will be able to do so. I can provide the payment agreement once
I receive it.” (Gov 2 at 15)
Applicant is still attempting to file his 2012 federal tax return. He obtained his W-2
forms for tax years 2013-2015 online. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did not post
the 2012 W-2 online. Applicant has to contact the IRS directly in order to get his W-2 for
2012. Applicant received refunds for tax years 2013 and 2014. He owes federal income
taxes for tax year 2015. He originally owed around $7,561. The balance is now $3,324.
He  was  on  a  payment  agreement  for  a  period  of  time.  The  IRS  did  not  allow  him  to
continue with the payment agreement because he did not timely file his 2016 and 2017
income tax returns. (Tr. 41-44; AE A; AE B)
Applicant’s  federal  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2016  and  2017  were  filed
approximately  one  week  before  the  hearing.  He  owes  about  $4,651  for  tax  year  2016
and is expecting a refund for tax year 2017 of $2,723. He also expects a refund for tax
year 2018 of 5,252. The IRS will apply the refunds towards the taxes he owes for 2015
and 2016. Applicant did not timely file his federal tax returns for 2016 and 2017 because
he  was  dealing  with  issues  with  his  mortgage  and  was  attending  school.  His  house
payment increased from $1,600 to $2,200 and he was trying to keep his house. (Tr. 45-
47; AE L; AE M; AE N)
Applicant’s 2010 reckless driving offense, his previous financial issues that raised
a  security  concern  in  2000,  his  failure  to  timely  file  his 2016  and  2017  federal  income
tax  returns,  and  his  $4,651  federal  tax  debt  for  tax  year  2016  were  not  alleged  in  the
SOR  as  disqualifying  conduct.  I  considered  these  facts  when  evaluating  evidence  of
extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances,  to  consider  whether  an  applicant
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation, or as part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR
Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct 26, 2016)
Regarding  the  state  income  tax  returns,  Applicant  filed  his  state  income  tax
returns  for  tax  years  2013,  2014,  and  2015  in  March  2017.  He  has  not  filed  his  2012
state  income tax  return.  His 2016,  2017  and  2018  state  tax  returns  were  filed  with  his
federal tax returns in early April 2019. Applicant owes $955 in state income taxes for tax
year  2015.  He  owes  $453  in  state  income  taxes  for  tax  year  2016.  He  anticipates
receiving a refund of $862 for tax year 2017 and a refund of $1,285 for tax year 2018.
He anticipates the refunds will be applied towards his state tax debt. He anticipates that
all state and federal taxes owed will be paid by the end of 2019. (Tr. 48-51; AE A; AE C;
AEL; AE M; AE N)
The status of the SOR debts other than the tax debts are:
SOR ¶ 1.d: $3,596 delinquent home mortgage account:  Applicant purchased the
house  in  January  2010.  He  tried  to  keep  up  with  is  mortgage  payments,  but  the
mortgage  went  to  foreclosure  in  August  2018.    Applicant  claims  he  owes  nothing
because  the  house  sold  for  more  than  the  mortgage  balance.  (Tr.  51-52,  77;  AE  A  at
16-17; AE C)
SOR  ¶  1.e:  $5,065  judgment  owed  to  a  homeowner’s  association  (HOA):
Applicant failed to pay the monthly HOA fees of $95. The HOA would add a $25 late fee
each  month  that  he  was  late.  The  balance  of  the  judgment  includes  attorney’s  fees.
Applicant’s  paycheck  was  garnished  $194.37.    In  total,  approximately  $2,493  was
garnished. The remaining balance is around $3,400. In March 2019, Applicant agreed to
pay $500 monthly towards the debt. He did not provide proof of payments made in April
2019 in accordance with the payment plan. (Tr. 54-58; AE A at 19-23; AE F)
SOR ¶ 1.f: $2,830 judgment entered in 2012: Applicant testified that this was for
a watch that he bought on credit for $3,000 in 2010.  Applicant satisfied this judgment.
(Tr. 59-61; AE A at 25-26; AE H at 22-23)
SOR ¶ 1.g:  $6,917 car loan that was charged off:  Applicant purchased this car
in late 2009. Applicant reduced the balance to $3,416. He is still attempting to settle this
account. He last contacted the debtor in 2017 in an attempt to settle the account. Status
remains unpaid. (Tr. 63-65; AE A at 28-29)
SOR ¶¶ 1.h: $2,948 motorcycle loan that was charged off: Applicant purchased
this motorcycle in February 2010. He paid this account in April 2017. (Tr. 63-64; AE A at
30-31; AE G; AE H at 20)
Although  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  Applicant  also  has  a  delinquent  military
exchange debt. He currently is making payments towards this debt. (Tr. 66; AE 10)
Applicant  is  currently  staying  with  a  friend.  He  has  been  paying  his  debts  for
about a year. He does not owe any other debts. He has not made any major purchases.
His net monthly income is $3,500. Applicant applies most of his income to his debts. He
timely  pays  $349  towards  his  student  loan  debt.  He  has  not  attended  recent  financial
counseling.  When  he  encountered  finance-related  security  clearance  issues  in  early
2000,  his  command  sent  him  to  financial  counseling.  The  financial  counseling  helped
him  organize  his  bills.  Applicant  has  not  vacationed  in  years.  He  intends  to  make
payments towards all of his remaining debts monthly until they are paid in full. (Tr. 68-
76)
