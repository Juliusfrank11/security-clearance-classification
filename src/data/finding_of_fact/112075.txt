The SOR alleges that Applicant owes delinquent child support of $15,673 (SOR
1.a). The account was placed in collection in In September 2015. Applicant admitted the
allegation. (GE 2 at 1; Applicant’s answer to SOR)
Applicant is 38 years old. He married in 2004 and divorced in 2012. He has five
children, two 17-year-old daughters, and three sons, ages 17, 4, and 1 year. Applicant
served  on  active  duty  in  the  United  States  (U.S.)  Army  from  July  1999  until  his
honorable discharge in March 2008. He attended vocational school from March 2008 for
six  years.  In  2014,  Applicant  began  taking  course  material  for  a  bachelor’s  degree  in
cybersecurity,  but  withdrew  to  begin  course  work  to  earn  information  technology  (IT)
certifications. In March 2018, he began online course work towards a bachelor’s degree
in science, with an ultimate goal of obtaining a master’s degree in IT. (GE 1 at 13, 27,
30; Tr. 7-15)
After  his  discharge  from  the  U.S.  Army  in  March  2008,  Applicant  worked  in
defense  contractor  positions  and  in  federal  employment  positions.  He  worked  as  a

material  coordinator,  a  supply  technician,  an  account  manager,  a  quality  safety
manager,  and  a  management  and  program  analyst.  In  2015,  Applicant  worked  in  his
first cyber security position. He was employed at a help desk from 2016 until June 2018,
when  the  contract  ended  resulting  in  his  unemployment.  He  is  still  unemployed.  He
currently  has  a  sponsor.  His  previous  periods  of  unemployment  were  March  to  June
2008, March to May 2012. September to November 2012, and July to September 2013.
He has held a security clearance since 1999. (GE 1 at 13-33; Tr. 10-15, 33-34)
Applicant’s first daughter  was  born  in 2002 and  she  is 17  years old.  In  January
2003, a child support court order for this daughter began in state X. The child support
payments were $289 a month; the support order increased to $350 a month in October
2008. Applicant  claims  that he  began  having  difficulty  paying  the  support after he  was
discharged  from  the  Army  in  2008.  Because  of  joint  marital  accounts  related  to  the
marriage (2004 to 2012) and lawyer fees related to the divorce, he could only pay some
but not all the monthly child support. He initially filed for separation from his former wife
in state X, but after he moved to state Y, he had to refile for separation. (Tr. 37-39)
When  Applicant’s  first  daughter  came  to  live  with  him  in  June  2016,  his  child
support should have been modified downward but it was not. In October 2016, the first
daughter  was  removed  from  Applicant’s  home  because  of  allegations  of  sexual abuse
against  Applicant  that  were  found  to  be  totally  groundless.  The  first  daughter  was
relocated  to  her  grandmother’s  residence,  but  after  residing  there  for  three  to  four
months,  she  ran  away.  The  daughter  was  placed  in  an  outplacement  program  at  a
boarding school in July 2018 and was to move back with Applicant in December 2018,
when she was discharged from the program. (Tr. 44-45, 53-55)
Applicant’s child support payment ledger for January 2003 through May 11, 2017
(child  support  for  first  daughter)  indicates  that  his  payment  record  to  the  county  child
support office of state X was neither regular in amount nor frequency. That is probably
why  his  child  support  arrears  ($35)  started  accruing  immediately  when  his  support
payments increased from $289 to $350 a month in October 2008. On March 30, 2017,
the state Y division of child support enforcement (DCSE), the state where he currently
resides,  informed  him  by  letter  that  he  owed  $15,673  in  past-due  child  support  and
threatened to suspend his driver’s license because his past-due child support was over
$5,000 or was past due by 90 days or more. (AE A; AE F)
When Applicant received the letter In March 2017 from state Y claiming he owed
child  support  arrears  of  $15,673  to  state  X  (division  of  child  support),  he  began  to
investigate  why  the  arrearage  was  so  high.  In  June  2017,  he  was  informed  by  letter
from  the  state  Y  division  of  child  support  enforcement  (DCSE)  that  because  of  the
existence of an out-of-state support order for the first daughter living with him in state Y
during the period, and an in-state child support order for the second daughter residing in
state  X,  the  wage  garnishment  payments  were  “splitting”  and  neither  mother  was
receiving  the  correct  support  due.  Instead,  they  were  receiving  partial  instead  of  full
support payments from state X child support office, which increased Applicant’s arrears.
No additional information was provided. Applicant hired an attorney in May 2018 and an
audit was conducted of his entire child support payment history for the first daughter. On
November 8, 2018, his attorney notified him that his child support hearing had just been
held  that  day.  The  court  found  that  his  child  support  obligation  (SOR  1.a)  was
suspended  retroactive  to  March  2018.  Applicant  still  owed  arrears  of  $6,794  to  the
mother of the SOR 1.a child support recipient, to be repaid at $30 a month. Applicant’s
arrears  owed  to  the  child  support  recipient’s  grandmother  was  $4,114,  to  be  repaid  at
$200 a month. Though Applicant had not received a court order that memorialized the
findings,  he  informed  the  judge  that  he  would  start making  payments  on  December  1,
2018, to the mother and grandmother. (AE A; AE B; AE D; AD E; Tr. 43-46)
Applicant  has  a  second  17-year-old  daughter  whose  child  support  order
(unalleged) was also implemented in January 2003. The terms of the support order are
the same as for the daughter in the preceding paragraph. Applicant claimed that he  is
regularly paying child support of $350 and $35 toward the arrearage on a monthly basis.
The arrearage amount, about $10,000, is not alleged in the SOR. Also unalleged in the
SOR are Applicant’s unofficial child support payments for his three sons: about $350 a
month  for  his  17-year-old  son;  about  $350  a  month  for  his  4-year-old  son;  and  about
$200 a month for his one-year-old son. (Tr. 40-42, 52, 57) I will consider this unalleged
evidence in evaluating Applicant’s case in mitigation or changed circumstances, and in
applying the factors of the whole-person concept.
Applicant receives a partial disability pay from the U.S. Army and is financing his
education  from  his  military  benefits.  He  lives  by  himself  in  an  apartment  that  that  he
rents for $1,100 a month. He has two cars; one is for commuting; the other is used  for
transporting  his  children  in  the  local  area  and  when  he  travels  to  state  X  to  visit  his
children. He purchased one car in September 2016 and one car in December 2017. He
pays  a  total  of  $973  a  month  for  both  cars.  He  pays  a  total  of  $100  a  month  for  two
motorcycles. He does not remember when he purchased one of the motorcycles, but he
remembered it cost between $3,000 and $4,000. He purchased the other motorcycle in
May 2018 for $5,000. He uses one of the motorcycles for the track and the other is for
leisure riding. Applicant has a total of $3,000 in his checking and saving accounts. He
has about  $500  in  stock.  He  participated  in financial  counseling  in  September 2018  to
remove the collection items that were negatively affecting his credit score. (Tr. 46-61)
In  March  2018,  Applicant  opened  a  limited  liability  cybersecurity  company  and
seeks to qualify for a facility security clearance so he can start bidding on contracts. He
is  trying  to  obtain  his  small  business  certification,  minority-owned  certification,  and  a
service veteran certification. (Tr. 71-73)
To  manage  his  earnings  and  expenditures,  Applicant  utilizes  a  budget  with  the
help  of  a  computer  software  program.  He  testified  that  he  wanted  an  opportunity  to
submit evidence of a budget. The record remained open until November 30, 2018, but
no post-hearing evidence was received. (Tr. 49, 62-63)
