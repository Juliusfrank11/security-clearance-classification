Applicant,  age  58,  is  married  and  has  one  adult  child.  She  obtained  her
undergraduate  degree  in  2007.  She  also  has  a  master’s  in  theology  and  other
certifications.  Applicant  completed  her  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  on
September 29, 2015. She has held a security clearance since 2004. (GE 1) She worked
for her current employer since 2015. She previously worked as a contractor since 1998.
(Tr. 18)
The  SOR  alleges  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  filing  in  2005  that  was  dismissed  in
2005 when Applicant failed to complete required filings; a 2016 state tax lien in the amount
of $7,308; a 2011 state tax lien in the amount of $13,132.00; a 2012 Federal tax lien in
the amount of $41,313.00; a medical account in the amount of $560; and a 2014 eviction
law suit. Applicant admitted the allegations relating to the financial allegations. The SOR
alleged  under  personal  conduct  concerns  three  instances  of  falsification  on  her  2015
security  clearance  application.  Applicant  denied  the  falsifications  on  the  security
clearance application and she provided explanations for her financial situation.
FINANCIAL
Applicant acknowledged her financial hardship, but reported unemployment from
December 2014 to February 2015 and from July 2015 to September 2015. Applicant was
self-employed from May 2007 to May 2009 and from October 2009 to December 2010.
(GE 2) Applicant also referred to bad advice from an accountant regarding the filing of
her self-employment tax return. A final unemployment occurred when a contract ended in
October 2017 until April 2018. (Tr. 47)
Applicant suffered a stroke in the workplace, but did not have health insurance as
she was working as a 1099 employee and responsible for health insurance. She suffered
some short term memory loss as a result, and noted this to the OPM investigator when
she had neglected to provide certain dates. (GE 2)
As to SOR 1.a, Applicant admitted the bankruptcy filing (GE 9) and explained that
her attorney advised her to file as there was a home contractor who was attempting to
garnish her wages and extract $68,000 from her for work that had not been done and for
which she had no account. (Tr. 51) She was not aware of this until she was purchasing a
home and it appeared on her credit report. Her attorney asked for proof from the company
that  Applicant  owed  $68,000  and  nothing  was  forthcoming.  The  bankruptcy  was
dismissed. It has not appeared on her credit bureau report for some time and she has
discussed this issue in previous investigations. The action is 12 years old.
Applicant  admitted  that  she  was  indebted  for  the  state  tax  lien  (SOR  1.b)  in  an
original amount of $7,308. However, Applicant stated that there is only one account or
lien for the state and the total is $13,132, which is the other state tax lien alleged in SOR
1.c. She submitted a document from the state comptroller, dated March 2018 showing a
balance of $4,786.08 for tax year 2007 and a balance of $9,072.72 for tax year 2009. (AE
A) Applicant explained that the tax was due to the inaccurate tax filing by her accountant.
Applicant was to file as an S corporation but the filing was for a C corporation. (Tr. 22)
She explained that in 2011, she began paying $400 a month, but it was not clear from the
record that the payment was going to the IRS. At one point, she received the checks back.
They had been torn in half. In 2018, Applicant contacted the state comptroller’s office and
explained her “situation.” Applicant reached an agreement for a payment plan for a term
of 60 months with a down payment of $1,374 and monthly payments of $235. She stated
that  the  tax  year  2008  had  been  paid  in  full.  Applicant  has  not  started  making  any
payments and stated that her husband had a massive heart attack and she is the only
one employed. (Tr. 25)
As to SOR 1.d, a 2012 Federal tax lien in the amount of $41,313, Applicant made
an offer in compromise for $2,400, which was accepted. She made monthly payments of
$100. Applicant presented a Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien (AE B) and a letter
from  the  IRS,  dated  2013  that  the  final payment  was  made  by  credit  card  and  that  all
payments had been made. (AE B)
As to SOR 1.e, a medical account in the amount of $560, Applicant stated that she
has been making payments to a creditor monthly in the amount of $87. However, there is
no record of any payments made to the account. As a post-hearing submission, Applicant
provided a receipt for $480, but it was not clear to whom it was paid. (AE F)
Applicant explained that the law suit situation which resulted in allegation SOR 1.f,
is due to a flood that occurred above her apartment in May 2014, when her dining room
filled  with  scalding  water  from  the  roof.  She  called  maintenance  and  after  about  20
minutes  a  technician.  The  technician  was  unsuccessful  in  stopping  the  water  and  he
called  the  supervisor.  It  took  another  20  minutes  to  turn  the  water  off  in  the  above
apartment. This left her  apartment uninhabitable and she checked into a hotel. (AE C)
Management asked Applicant to move all her belongings out so that the apartment could
be renovated. When Applicant asked to be reimbursed for her May rent and expenses
paid for the hotel night, she was told no. Applicant moved things as fast as she could.
Before she was finished a notice of eviction was placed on her door. She was charged
for various repairs for which she paid.
Applicant  volunteered  that  she  filed  for  an  extension  for  her  2017  Federal  tax
return. (Tr. 59) It has been filed and she owes about $8,000. She stated that she believes
she  also  owes  states  tax  for  2017.  (Tr.  60)  She  testified  that  this  was  due  to  the  old
accountant that she had a problem with concerning the S versus C corporation,  i.e,  filing
the wrong tax returns during her self-employment in 2008.  She has a new accountant.
PERSONAL CONDUCT
When  Applicant  completed  her  2015  SCA,  she  answered  “No”  to  Section  26
concerning liens against your property or failure to pay taxes in the past seven years. She
also  answered  “No”  to  Section  26  concerning  bills  or  debts  turned  over  to  collection
accounts.  Also,  Applicant  responded  “No”  to  Section  28  regarding  non-criminal  court
actions in the last ten years.
Applicant denied that she intentionally falsified her 2015 SCA. In her answer, she
stated that she did not have a lien placed against her property for failure to pay taxes.
She stated that she did not become a home owner until 2015 and the taxes owed were
paid in 2013.  She testified that she answered all questions to the best of her ability and
as for being a party to a law suit regarding the apartment, the amount of money was paid
and she did not regard this as being a party to a law suit. She realized at the hearing that
she answered incorrectly. (Tr. 35)  She was adamant that she did not believe the medical
account  was  in  collection  because  it  was  due  and  owing  to  a  hospital.  (Tr.  36)    She
testified  at  the  hearing  that  she  had  liens  (both  state  and  federal)  but  they  had  been
resolved in years prior.  Applicant stated that she kept no information from the investigator
during her interview. (Tr.45) She reiterated that she was completely open and honest with
the Government when she answered the questions.
