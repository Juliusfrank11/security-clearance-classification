Applicant  is  a  56-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance.  He  is  employed  as  a  custodian  for  a  company  in  the  defense  industry.  He
has  been  so  employed  since  2016.  He  was  initially  hired  at  an  hourly  rate  of  $11.00,
and  he  now  earns  $13.67  per  hour.  His  formal  education  consists  of  a  high  school
diploma and a certificate in automotive repair or maintenance from a technical institute
awarded in 1984. He married in 2013, and he has no children. His spouse works as an
administrative  assistant  for  a  community  college.  Applicant  is  unaware  of  her  income;
they handle their money separately; and they share living expenses.
Before his current employment, Applicant worked full-time as a carpet technician
for a casino during 2014-2016. Before that, he worked full-time as a security guard for
two  different  companies  during  2008-2014.  Before  that,  he  worked  full-time  as  a
custodian  for  a  federal  contractor  during  1999-2008.  His  employment  history  does  not
include service in the U.S. armed forces.
The SOR concerns a history of financial problems consisting of about $5,000 in
back taxes owed to the IRS for multiple tax years and 22 delinquent accounts totaling
more  than  $50,000.  Concerning  the  delinquent  accounts,  they  include  13  collection
accounts, 7 charged-off accounts, and 2 unpaid judgments for a total of about $56,152.
Two  of  the  13  collection  accounts  are  medical  collection  accounts  for  about  $1,687  in
total.  In  addition  to  his  admissions  in  his  answers  to  the  SOR  and  during  the  hearing,
the  delinquent  accounts  are  established  by  credit  reports from  2016,  2017,  and  2018.
(Exhibits  4,  5,  6,  and  7).  He  explained  that  he  incurred  the  large  amount  of
indebtedness  because  he  had  too  many  credit  cards.  (Tr.  37)  At  the  hearing,  it  was
established  that  the  $453  charged-off  account  in  SOR  ¶  1.t  was  paid.  (Tr.  45-46)
Likewise, it was established that the $154 medical collection account in SOR ¶ 1.x was
not  supported  by  the  documentary  evidence.  (Tr.  48)  Otherwise,  Applicant  did  not
present  any  reliable  documentation  to  establish  that  any  of  other  20  delinquent  debts
were  paid,  settled,  in  a  repayment  arrangement,  in  dispute,  forgiven,  cancelled,  or
otherwise resolved. I find that those 20 delinquent accounts in the SOR are unresolved.
Concerning the tax matters, Applicant admitted owing back taxes to the IRS for
tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015 in amounts of $2,708, $1,932, and $306, respectively.
He explained that he incurred the tax debt because he did not have enough tax withheld
from his paycheck. (Tr. 31) He has been repaying the IRS in an installment agreement
since at least 2016. (Exhibit 3) A November 2016 monthly notice from the IRS showed
that he was required to make a $150 monthly payment and that  he owed $132 for tax
year 2011, $2,708 for 2013, $1,932 for 2014, and $360 for 2015. (Exhibit 3) A May 2017
monthly  notice  from  the  IRS  showed  that  he  was  required  to  make  a  $150  monthly
payment  and  that  he  owed  $2,890  for  tax  year  2013,  $1,462  for  2014,  and  $381  for
2015. (Exhibit 2) He did not present more up-to-date documentation from the IRS at the
hearing.  He  stated  he  is  paying  $180  monthly  on  the  installment  agreement,  and  he
estimated owing a total of about $1,899. (Tr. 31-34) He stated that refunds for tax years
2016  and  2017  were  withheld  by  the  IRS  for  payment  of  the  back  taxes.  (Tr.  35)  He
thinks he owes back taxes to the state tax authority, but he did not have much detail on
the subject. (Tr. 34)
Applicant  has  a  checking  account  with  a  balance  of  about  $899,  but  does  not
have a savings account. (Tr. 50) He had no financial assets other than a 401(k) account
with his current employer with a balance of about $7,000. (Tr. 50-51) He estimated his
annual gross income at about $32,000. (Tr. 37)
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has
1  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S.  518,  528  (1988)  (“it  should  be  obvious  that  no  one  has  a
‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no
right to a security clearance).
2 484 U.S. at 531.
3 484 U.S. at 531.
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.6
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;
AG ¶ 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local
income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income
tax as required;
4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).
5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).
6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶¶ E3.1.14 and E3.1.15.
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and
AG ¶ 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax
authority  to  file  or  pay  the  amount  owed  and  is  in  compliance  with  those
arrangements.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. His problematic
financial history is likely traceable to financial irresponsibility and neglect. He used credit
cards to spend more than he could repay, and he did not stay current with his federal
tax obligations. The disqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.
Concerning  the  remaining  delinquent  accounts  for  more  than  $50,000,  what  is
missing  here  is  obvious;  namely,  Applicant  failed  to  take  any  substantial  affirmative
action  (“a  good-faith  effort”)  to  resolve  the  indebtedness.  He  owes  more  in  delinquent
debt than he earns on an annual basis, and he has little in the way of financial assets.
He does not have a realistic plan in place to resolve the indebtedness. It is unlikely that
he will repay those debts in the foreseeable future, if ever. Given the level of his assets
and liabilities, his best course of action may be to seek relief in bankruptcy court.
It does appear that Applicant has made some progress on the federal income tax
matters.  There  is  some  documentation  from  2016  and  2017  to  establish  that  he  has
made  payments  under  an  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS.  But  again,  what  is
missing here is obvious; namely, current documentation  showing his adherence to  the
agreement.  Given  the  lack  of  current  documentation,  I  cannot  conclude  that  he  is  in
compliance with the IRS installment agreement.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent  standard,  I  have  doubts  about
Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or
sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence  as  a  whole
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or  vice
versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he has  not met his
ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  show  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
