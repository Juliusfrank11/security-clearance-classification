Applicant admitted the two allegations in SOR: ¶¶ 1.a, and 1.b. After a thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  31-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  pages  5
and 14.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since July of 2016. (GX 1
at  pages  14~15.)  He  is  unmarried,  and  has  no  children.  (GX  1  at  pages  24~25.)
Applicant attributes his admitted financial difficulties to periods of unemployment. (TR at
page 12 line 24 to page 17 line 6.)
Guideline F – Financial Considerations
1.a.  Applicant  has  failed  to  file,  as  required,  Federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax
years 2011~2013 and for 2016. (TR at page 20 line 10 to page 28 line 13.) He attributes
his failure to file  due  to  periods  of  overseas  deployment  while  in  the  Air  Force,  and to
simple  procrastination.  (Id,  and  GX  1  at  pages  18~19.)  Applicant  has  submitted
documentation showing his filing for tax year 2014 (AppX A), and he had no income in
2015 as he was unemployed (GX 1 at page 15). Despite having two months to do so,
however, Applicant submitted nothing showing he has filed for tax years 2011~2013 and
for 2016; and as such, this allegation is found against Applicant.
1.b. Applicant admits that he has a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of
about $3,783. (TR at page 17 line 3 to page 19 line 13, and at page 28 line 13.) Despite
having  two  months  to  do  so,  Applicant  submitted  nothing  showing  he  has  addressed
this admitted debt; and as such, this allegation is found against Applicant.
