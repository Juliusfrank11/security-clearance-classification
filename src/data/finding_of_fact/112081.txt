The  SOR  alleged  under  Guideline  F  that  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  federal
income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2014, and 2016; and state income tax returns for
tax  years  2013  and  2014. (SOR  ¶¶ 1.a  and  1.b, respectively.)  Under  Guideline  E,  the
SOR alleged that Applicant failed twice to adhere to court-ordered alcohol abstinence in
2015. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b) It further alleged that Applicant falsified his 2015 SCA when
he answered  “No” to questions  in  Section  26  (Financial  Record)  and failed  to  disclose
that he did not timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2014, and 2016;
and state income tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2014. (SOR ¶ 2.c)
In his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b,
and 2.c. He denied SOR ¶ 2.a, but at his hearing, Applicant amended his SOR Answer
and admitted the allegation. (Tr. 71) He denied SOR ¶ 2.b. His admissions to the SOR
and at his hearing are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of
the  record  evidence,  including  his  testimony  and  all  evidence  admitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  58-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  received  a
General  Education  Development  (GED)  certificate  in  1978.  Since  then,  he  has
completed  numerous  job-related  technical  certifications.  He  has  never  been  married,
and has no children.
Applicant’s  employment  history  shows  that  he  has  worked  for  different  federal
contractors  since  1990.  He  has  held  a  secret  clearance  continuously  since  the  early
1990s. His current employer and security sponsor hired him in July 2014.
Applicant explained that his failure to file 2011 income tax returns resulted from
medical problems in 2011-2012 (diagnosed with cancer). He received treatment during
two years, but he is now considered to be in remission. (Tr. 20-22) Additionally, in 2014,
he  withdrew  $50,000  from  his  401k  retirement  account  to  buy  a  home.  He  was  not
aware of the tax penalties associated with an early withdrawal of 401k monies, and the
additional  income  placed  him  in  a  higher  tax  bracket.  Applicant  claimed  that  he
prepared the 2014 federal income tax return, but did not file it because he did not have
the money to pay the tax owed. Apparently, he also failed to file his 2016 federal income
tax  return  and  his  state  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2013  and  2014  because  he  did  not
have the money to pay the taxes owed. He averred that unexpected maintenance costs
for his new home were so high that he did not have the money to pay his owed taxes
and did not file his income tax returns. (Tr. 22-23)
Applicant  also  stated  during  his  2016  interview  with  a  government  investigator
that  he  did  not  file  his  2014  and  2016  income  tax  returns  because  he  moved
residences,  and  he  could  not  find  his  documents.  He  was  not  diligent  about  filing
because he believed it was not a big deal since he believed that he owed no taxes. He
promised  the  investigator  that  he  would  promptly  file  his  2014  and  2015  income  tax
returns, and he did. (GE 2)
After his 2016 interview, Applicant became scared about the concerns raised by
his failure to file his 2014 income tax returns and hired a tax preparer to do so. He filed
his 2014 federal income tax return in February 2017, and in June 2017, he paid the IRS
$27,000 for back taxes. (Tr. 100) At his hearing, Applicant testified he had filed all of his
overdue returns and he owed no back taxes to the IRS.
Although  Applicant  requested  tax  return  transcripts  for  tax  years  2008  –  2010,
the IRS no longer has those records. The IRS Wage and Income Transcript form for tax
year 2011 (prepared in 2017) shows that Applicant filed his 2010 income tax return and
received  a  $53  refund.  The  IRS  Wage  and  Income  Transcript  form  for  tax  year  2011
does  not  indicate  that  Applicant  filed  his  2011  income  tax  return.  (Only  the  first  page
was  submitted  and  it  appears  to  be  a  multipage  document.)  He  provided  no
documentary  evidence  to  show  he  filed  it,  but  implied  that  he  did.  (Tr.  33)  During  his
2016  interview,  Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  he  did  not  file  his  2011  income  tax
return, and when confronted by the IRS about it, and threatened with a garnishment of
wages, Applicant agreed to the garnishment of wages to satisfy the 2011 tax debt. (GE
2, Tr. 77-81)
Applicant  filed  his  2012  federal  income  tax  return  in  October  2013.  He  filed  his
2013 federal income tax return in April 2014. He filed his 2014 federal income tax return
in  February  2017.  Apparently,  he  filed  his  2015  income  tax  return  between  2016  and
2017. He requested a 2015 tax transcript, but the IRS informed him that there was an
identity  theft  issue  with  that  year’s  return.  (GE  2) He filed  his  2016 federal  income  tax
return on June 26, 2017. (GE 2)
Concerning  his  2013  and  2014  state  income  tax  returns,  Applicant  testified  he
filed them late and paid off any taxes due for tax year 2013. He still owes about $2,000
for tax year 2014, but has been making $150 monthly payments as agreed. (Tr. 35)
Section  26  (Financial  Record  -  Taxes)  of  the  2015  SCA,  asked  Applicant  to
disclose  whether  in  the  last  seven  years  he  had  failed  to  file  or  pay  federal,  state,  or
other taxes when required by law. Applicant answered “No,” and failed to disclose that
he did not timely file a federal income tax return for tax year 2011, and a state income
tax return for tax year 2013. I note that Applicant submitted the 2015 SCA in February
2015. Thus, at that time, the only late returns would have been the 2011 federal return
and the 2013 state return.
Applicant admitted that he provided an inaccurate response in his 2015 SCA, but
averred  that  he  is  an  honest  person  who  made  an  inadvertent  and  honest  mistake.
Applicant  explained  he  had  submitted  an  SCA  before  he  failed  to  file  his  income  tax
returns in 2011, and before he was charged with DUI in 2014. (The prior SCA is not part
of  the  record.)  When  his  employer’s  FSO  found  out  about  his  2014  DUI  charge,
Applicant was asked to update the prior SCA with the DUI information. Because he was
not  asked  to  update  the  whole  SCA,  he  only  updated  the  DUI  questions,  and  did  not
look at or update any other SCA sections, including the questions about his failure to file
income  tax  returns.  Applicant  highlighted  that  when  he  was  asked  during  his  2016
interview  about  his  tax  problems,  he  promptly  disclosed  that  he  had  failed  to  file  his
federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2014; the state returns for 2013 and 2014; and
he disclosed that he had identity theft issues with his 2015 tax return. (Ge 2, Tr. 24-25)
Regarding  the  SOR  allegations  that  Applicant  failed  twice  to  adhere  to  court-
ordered  alcohol  abstinence  in  2015  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a  and  2.b),  I  find  that  the  evidence  is
insufficient  to  establish  SOR  ¶  2.b.  Applicant  explained  that  the  court  ordered  him  to
abstain  from  alcohol  consumption  while  undergoing  alcohol  counseling.  Applicant
admitted that during his counseling period, he took a urinalysis screening for alcohol in
his  system  and  failed  once.  (GE  5)  He  denied  that  the  Interlock  device  in  his  vehicle
was  ever  fully  triggered.  He  repeatedly  stated  that  the  device  had  a  false  positive  on
one  occasion,  but  that  the  Interlock  device  was  not  activated.  When  he  retried  the
Interlock device after five minutes, the car started. After Applicant’s compliance with the
other  terms  of  his  sentence,  the  charge  for  violating  the  terms  of  his  probation  was
dismissed. (Tr. 75, GE 5)
Applicant considers himself to be honest, reliable, hardworking, and a key player
within  his  company.  He  believes  he will  be  devastated  if  he  was  to  lose  his  clearance
eligibility because he would likely lose his job, and at his age it would be difficult to get a
new  job.  His  references  consider  Applicant  to  be  honest,  trustworthy,  dedicated,
hardworking, and a competent and valuable employee. They endorsed his eligibility for
a clearance.
Applicant acknowledged that he made a mistake when he failed to timely file his
federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  because  he  did  not  have  the  money  to  pay  the
taxes  owed.  He  acknowledged  he  should  have  been  more  diligent  about  filing  the
income tax returns. He believes that he has learned a valuable lesson. He understands
the  seriousness  of  the  security  concerns  raised  by  his  tax  problems.  He  promised  to
timely  file  and  pay  his  taxes  in  the  future.  Applicant  highlighted  his  40  years  of
employment with federal contractors while holding a clearance since 1990s. He believes
that his financial situation is now stable.
