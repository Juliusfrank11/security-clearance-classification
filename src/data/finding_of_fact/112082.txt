Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since 2009. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1986
until his general under honorable conditions discharge in 1994. He attended college for
a  period  without  earning  a  degree.  He  is  married  for  the  second  time,  but  separated
since about 2013. He does not have children. (Items 4, 5)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  problems.  He  apparently  resolved  the
problems  he  had  in  the  2000s.  He  attributed  his  recent  problems  to  his  marital
separation, medical issues, and a significant reduction in his salary. (Items 2, 5-10; AE
A)
The  SOR  alleges  a  mortgage  loan  that  is  in  foreclosure;  four  defaulted  student
loans  totaling  $18,445;  two  delinquent  debts  to  banks  totaling  $12,114;  and  a  $1,488
debt to a state. The SOR also alleges a $5,756 debt (SOR ¶ 1.c) to the same bank as
the  $7,406  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.h.  I  conclude  these  are  duplicate  allegations  that
allege  the  same  debt.  Applicant  admitted  owing  all  the  non-duplicate  debts,  but  he
stated that he was paying some of the debts. (Item 2; AE A)
Applicant  contracted  with  a  credit  counseling  company  in  about  2016  to  assist
him  in  resolving  his  debts.  The  specifics  of  how  long  he  was  in  the  company’s  debt-
management  plan  and  how  much  he  paid  are  unavailable.  However,  when  he
responded  to  the  SOR  in  June  2017,  he  indicated  that  he  had  been  paying  debts
through the plan for more than a year. (Item 2; AE A)
Applicant indicated in his June 2017 response to the SOR that he planned to use
his income tax refund to pay his Department of Education student loans. It is unclear if
anything  was  paid  in 2017.  However,  in  October 2018,  the  IRS  withheld  $10,752 from
his  income  tax  refund  and  applied  it  to  his student  loans.  The  April  2019  credit  report
listed  the  total  balance  of  the  four  student  loans  as  $9,756.  In  July  2019,  the  IRS
withheld another $8,675 from his income tax refund and applied it to his student loans.

Applicant started payments to the state for the $1,488 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i
in 2017. He paid the debt in full in November 2017. (Items 2, 7-10; AE A, B)
Applicant wrote in his June 2017 response to the SOR that he had been paying
the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h through the debt-management plan for about a year. He
did not submit documentation of the actual payments, but the credit reports support his
assertion. The April 2016 credit report lists the balance of the debt as $7,408. The three
subsequent  credit  reports  list  the  balance  as  $5,756  in  March  2017;  $4,584  in  August
2017; and $3,268 in April 2019. The evidence for the $4,706 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d
is similar to the above. The balance in 2017 was $4,706. In April 2019, the balance was
$3,647. (Items 2, 7-10; AE A)
Applicant bought a house for $248,500 in 2007. The purchase was financed by a
joint mortgage  loan.  It  appears  that the  house  was  mainly  for his wife  to  live  in, as  he
has lived primarily in Japan since 2006. He lived in the house for about  five months in
2008 to 2009, before returning to Japan. The creditor initiated foreclosure proceedings,
but agreed to a short sale. The house was sold for $229,458 in August 2018, which was
less than what was owed on the mortgage loan. There is no indication that the creditor
is seeking the deficiency owed on the loan. (Items 2, 4, 7-10; AE A, F)
Applicant  stated  that  his  finances  are  greatly  improved.  He  plans  to  continue
paying  his debts.  He  will  increase  the  payments  to  the  two  remaining  consumer  debts
after the student loans are paid. He expects to be completely debt free within two years.
