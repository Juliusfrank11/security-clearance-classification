In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 42-year-old messaging analyst employed by a defense contractor
since April 2015. He worked for federal contractors from November 2000 to November
2005, was unemployed from November 2005 to December 2006, and worked for federal
contractors from December 2006 to December 2007, November 2009 to October 2011,
and November 2011 to mid-2013. He left his job as a federal contractor in 2013, because
he  had  not  completed  required  training.  (FORM  Item  10  at  3.)  He  has  worked
intermittently as an independent contractor since April 1998. When he has a full-time job,
he works as an independent contractor on weekends. (FORM Item 10 at 2.)
Applicant is a high school graduate. He has never married and has no children. He
has held a security clearance since at least November 1998 (FORM Item 10 at 5.)
The SOR, as amended, alleges six delinquent debts reflected in credit reports from
April 2015 (FORM Item 9), February 2017 (FORM Item 7), and September 2018 (FORM
Item 6). The evidence concerning these delinquent debts is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: mortgage loan past due for $16,834, in foreclosure with balance
of $271,350. Applicant submitted no documentary evidence of the status of this debt. The
September 2018 credit report reflects that the last payment on this debt was in July 2017.
It is not resolved.
1 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (FORM Item 5) unless
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
SOR ¶ 1.b: home-improvement loan charged off for $33,381. In his answer to
the  SOR,  Applicant  stated  that  he  had  an  agreement  to  pay  $50  per  month  on  this
account. The September 2018 credit report reflects that the last payment on this debt was
in August 2017. He did not provide any documentary evidence of a payment agreement
or payments.
SOR ¶ 1.c: credit-card account charged off for $10,327. In his answer to the
SOR,  Applicant  stated  that  he  had  a  payment  agreement  providing  for  monthly  $195
payments. The September 2018 credit report reflects that the last payment on this debt
was in July 2017. He did not provide any documentary evidence of a payment agreement
or payments.
SOR  ¶  1.d:  withdrawn.  This  debt  was  resolved  before  Applicant  submitted  his
answer to the SOR.
SOR ¶ 1.e: judgment filed in 2016 for $7,962. This debt is for delinquent taxes.
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that his “tax person” is working to resolve or
set up a payment agreement for this debt. It is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.f: withdrawn. This debt is a duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a.
SOR  ¶  1.g:  debt  to  local  government,  placed  for  collection  of  $180.  In  his
answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he thought that this debt was a traffic ticket. In
the August 2016 PSI, he stated that it was a delinquent utility bill. (FORM Item 10 at 6.) It
is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.h: debt to fitness club, placed for collection of $125. In his answer to
the SOR, Applicant stated the collection account was closed and returned to the original
creditor. He did not provide any documentary evidence showing that the debt is resolved.
When  Applicant  submitted  his  SCA,  he  answered  “no”  to  all  questions  asking
whether  he  had  any  financial  delinquencies.  He  did  not  disclose  any  of  the delinquent
debts alleged in the SOR. In his answer to the SOR, he stated that all debts reflected in
his credit report were paid off before he purchased his home and that, if he had any recent
delinquent debts, he must have misread the question due to haste in completing the SCA.
The credit reports reflect that his mortgage loan was opened in April 2016, about a year
after he submitted his SCA. (FORM Item 6 at 2; FORM Item 7 at 1.)
Applicant submitted his SCA on April 7, 2015. The credit report from April 21, 2015
reflected five delinquent debts: (1) a credit card that was past due for $1,365, on which
the last activity was in October 2013; (2) a telecommunications account that was past due
for $564, on which the last activity was in January 2014; (3) a telecommunications account
that was past due for $238, on which the last activity was in October 2013; (4) a delinquent
traffic ticket for $180, alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g; and (5) a delinquent $125 debt to a fitness
club, alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h.
When Applicant was confronted with these debts during the August 2016 PSI, he
told an investigator that he did not list these debts in his SCA because he paid the $238
telecommunication bill in December 2015 and paid the other debts on specific dates he
could not recall in 2015. (FORM Item 10 at 6-7.) The credit reports from February 2017
and September 2018 reflected that the delinquent credit-card account and one of the two
delinquent telecommunications accounts had been paid at some time after the April 2015
credit report was issued, but the $564 telecommunications account and the debts alleged
in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h were not resolved. (FORM Item 7 at 2.)
Applicant  attributed  his  delinquent  debts  to  inadequate  self-employment  income
when he was not employed full time between mid-2013 and April 2015. (FORM Item 10
at 9.) He has not provided any specific information about his income and expenses during
his  period  of  unemployment,  nor  has  he  provided  any  specific  information  about  his
income and expenses since he began his current job in April 2015.
