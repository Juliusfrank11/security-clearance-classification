In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through
1.i,  and  she  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.j  and  1.k.  (HE  3)  She  also  provided
extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings
of fact.
Applicant is 44 years old, and she has been employed by a defense contractor in
workforce  planning  since  2016.  (Tr.  5,  8,  35;  GE  1)  In  1999,  she  graduated  from  high
school; in 1996, she received a bachelor’s degree; and in 2001, she received a master’s
degree in business administration. (Tr. 5, 7) She has not served in the military. (Tr. 7) In
2001, she married, and in 2012, she separated from her spouse. (Tr. 6, 20) Her twins are
age 11, and her other child is 12. (Tr. 7) She has custody of her three children, and her
husband is living outside of the United States. (Tr. 29)
Financial Considerations
Applicant gave her financial information to her husband’s father who was supposed
to file her income tax returns. (Tr. 21) When her father-in-law filed the tax returns, he filed
married separate, and he allocated the deductions to her husband. (Tr. 21, 42-43; GE 1)
When  she  received  correspondence from  the  IRS,  she  gave  the  documentation  to  her
father-in-law, and she believed he was handling filing of necessary tax returns for her in
good faith. (Tr. 22) She believed her husband was going to pay her share of the taxes
because he was using the deductions. (Tr. 23; GE 1) She believed that the tax lien was
a  marital  debt,  and  thus,  her  husband  was  responsible  for  half  of  the  debt.  (Tr.  24)
Applicant’s husband was arrested on multiple occasions for domestic violence, and on
one  occasion,  he  knocked  out  some  of  Applicant’s  teeth.  (Tr.  31)  She  made  12  Child
Protective Services (CPS) complaints against him, and he does not visit their children.
(Tr. 31) When her husband left, he took the funds from their retirement accounts. (Tr. 40)
Her September 8, 2012 separation agreement indicated Applicant and her husband had
to file a consent order to have their mutual protective orders against each other dismissed.
(AE V at 17) Applicant recently obtained a second job to enable her to pay her debts. (AE
L) See also GE 1, Section 22 (indicating in August 2012 Applicant’s husband obtained
her arrest for trespass, disturbing the peace, and assault).
In 2012, Applicant was sick and unable to work outside her home for four months.
(Tr.  34-35,  41;  SOR  response;  GE  1)  Applicant’s  SOR  alleges  the  following  financial
issues.
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.g,  and  1.i  allege  eight  delinquent  medical  debts  totaling
$2,198 in the following amounts: $877; $674; $321; $121; $67; $35; $34; and $69. She
said she paid several of the medical debts. (Tr. 31-32; AE B) Applicant paid $15,000 for
her children’s braces. (Tr. 21) She said she just paid the debt for $877. (Tr. 31-32; AE U)
She pays her family’s medical bills as she receives them. (Tr. 32)
After  her  hearing,  Applicant  provided  a  printout  of  her  healthcare  claims  and
payment  activity  from  August  2016  to  January  2019.  (AE  U)  The  chart  listed
approximately  140  payments  to  medical  creditors.  Many  of  the  payments  were  made
using a credit card and the source of the claim is not indicated on the printout. Several
substantial  payments  are  from  a  health  savings  account.  (AE  U)  The  following  table
shows a sample of some of the payments for medical and orthodontic bills she made from
December 2017 to January 2019.

Applicant’s  September  8,  2012  separation  agreement  indicated  Applicant’s
husband was required to maintain health insurance for Applicant and their three children
so  long  as  it  was  available  at  reasonable  cost  through  his  employer.  (AE  V  at 11,  13)
Unreimbursed  medical,  dental,  and  orthodontic  expenses  for  each  minor  child  were
required  to  be  paid  in  direct  proportion  to  each  party’s  share  of  their  combined  gross
income. (AE V at 12) His separation agreement required him to pay some of the other
family bills; however,  he only made sporadic payments. (Tr. 30) She has attempted to
convince  her  husband  to  pay  some  of  the  medical  debts.  (AE  M)  Applicant  acted
reasonably and responsibly in the overall resolution of her medical and dental debts, and
she mitigated SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.g, and 1.i.
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges a tax lien filed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2012
for $28,188. A copy of the tax lien is not part of the record, and it is unclear which tax year
or  years  were  addressed  with  this  lien. The  lien appears to  be for  tax  years  2008 and
2011 based on the IRS tax transcripts which show transfers of refunds to those two tax
years.  (AE  F;  AE  G)  Applicant’s  September  8,  2012  separation  agreement  indicated
Applicant and her husband were responsible for joint debts incurred prior to May 2012,
and Applicant has a good faith argument that her husband is jointly responsible for half
of her tax debts for tax years 2008 and 2011. (AE at 15)

Applicant’s tax transcript for tax year 2008 indicates that she timely filed and paid
($32,955) to address her federal taxes for tax year 2008. (AE G) In March 2011, the IRS
assessed $15,590 in additional taxes for tax year 2008 and over the next seven years,
about $10,000 in penalties and interest. (AE G) Her federal income tax refunds for tax
years 2012 ($16,262) and 2013 ($1,024) were applied to this debt. (AE G) On August 31,
1 Applicant may have miscalculated the child and dependent care credit. She indicated $1,000 on
lines 3 and 6 of Form 2441, instead of $6,000. (AE Q) She may be entitled to a credit of $1,200 instead of
$200 on line 49 of Form 1040. (AE Q)
2018, she paid the IRS $4,701, and the IRS credited her with paying her tax debt on her
tax transcript for tax year 2008. (AE G)
Applicant did not owe any federal income taxes for tax years 2009, 2010, 2012,
2013,  and  2014.  (Tr.  25-26;  AE  F)  Applicant  timely  filed  her  2011  federal  income  tax
return; however, she owed about $3,500 at the time she filed her tax return. (AE F) On
August 31, 2018, the IRS transferred a $490 credit from tax year 2008, and on October
5, 2018, she paid $4,230, resolving her tax debt for tax year 2011. (AE F; AE G)
SOR  ¶  1.j  alleges  Applicant  failed  to  file  or  pay  her  federal  income  taxes  as
required for tax years 2012 through 2015. She said she filed her 2013 and 2014 federal
income tax returns sometime before she responded to the SOR; however, she did not
specify  when  she filed  them.  (Tr. 25-26; SOR  response) In  November  2017,  Applicant
paid the IRS $14,504. (AE C) At the time of her hearing, she had not filed her tax returns
for tax years 2015 and 2016 because she needed information from her husband to file
her  tax  returns.  (Tr.  25-27)  She  wanted  to  be  sure  that  she  correctly  filed  all  needed
information  for  her  tax  returns.  (Tr.  26-27)2  She  met  with  a  divorce  lawyer  in  2014;
however, she had not seen a lawyer recently because she lacked funds to pay her lawyer.
(Tr. 27) Her lawyer told her not to file the tax returns. (Tr. 27) Her lawyer said she needed
to consult someone knowledgeable about taxes before doing anything. (Tr. 27-28) The
first  certified  public  accountant  (CPA)  she  consulted  wanted  $5,000  before  he  would
advise her on what she should do. (Tr. 28) Her husband said he filed his tax returns. (Tr.
29) He is outside the country working for the U.S. Government, and he refused to give
her information or assist her. (Tr. 29) He did not believe a court would be able to force
him to cooperate with her because he is out of the country. (Tr. 29)
SOR ¶ 1.k alleges Applicant failed to file or pay her state income taxes as required
for tax years 2012 through 2015.
On  December  21,  2018,  I  asked  Applicant  to  provide  copies  of  her  federal  and
state tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2016.3 If the tax returns are undated, I asked
her to disclose when they were filed. Her “final suspense” was January 25, 2019.
2  The
inaccurate  return.  See
Internal  Revenue  Service  may  reject  an
IRS  website,
https://www.irs.gov/faqs/electronic-filing-e-file. Applicant filed her tax returns using a commercial electronic
software program. (AE N-AE Q) Applicant attempted to file her 2015 federal income tax return on April 18,
2016, (the date it was due) electronically; however, the IRS rejected her electronic return without specifying
the reason(s). (AE Q) Electronic returns are not accepted by the IRS after November of the year they are
due. (IRS website) The proper recourse after a return is rejected is to contact the IRS, and then the IRS
may instruct the caller to file the return manually. Applicant provided a 2015 federal income tax return dated
December 1, 2018, which was manually signed. (AE Q) When tax information is unavailable, the taxpayer
is supposed to provide a good-faith estimate and disclose the estimation to the IRS. See American Institute
of  Certified  Public  Accountants  website,  “Standards  for  Tax  Services  No.  4,  Use  of  Estimates,”
https://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/tax/resources/standardsethics/statementsonstandardsfortaxservices/
downloadabledocuments/ssts-no.4-use-of-estimates.pdf.
3 Copies of email communications from and to Applicant are the source for the information in this
paragraph and the next three paragraphs. (AE W)
On January 24, 2018, Applicant said she provided as attachments to emails:
[c]opies of all my Federal and state returns. From 2012 on. I cannot get onto
the IRS website to get the filing dates for the ones prior to 2015 because I
changed my phone number and that's how the[y] verify. I need to have a
new code mailed to access the online website to see my transcripts. I've
been calling and cannot get through. I would assume that's due to the shut
down. I'll call again in the morning. 2015 and 2016 were mailed in Dec.
Applicant provided her federal and state tax returns for tax years 2012, 2013, and
2014, and she provided her federal tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016. On January
27, 2019, I asked Applicant to provide copies of her federal and state tax returns for tax
year 2017. I also asked her to provide copies of her state tax returns for 2015 and 2016.
I noted that many of the tax returns she previously provided are undated, and I asked her
to disclose when they were filed.4 Her suspense to submit documentation was February
20, 2019. I did not receive a response to my January 27, 2019 email.
In  November  2017,  Applicant  paid  a  credit  card  debt  for  $5,272.  (AE  A)  On
December 12, 2018, she sent $5,000 to the IRS to ensure the IRS had ample funds to
address any income tax she owed. (AE L)
