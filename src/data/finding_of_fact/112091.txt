Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 20 line
22 to page 21 line 13, and GX 1 at page 5.)  He has been employed  with the defense
contractor “since July of 2017.” (TR at page 20 line 22 to page 21 line 13.) He is married
to  a  Philippine  national;  and  has  three  children,  the  two  eldest  living  with  his  former
spouse in the United States. (TR at page 20 lines 18~21, and GX 1 at pages 46~47 and
53.)  His  youngest  child  resides  in  the  Philippines  with  the  child  mother,  Applicant’s
current wife. Applicant resides in the United States.
Guideline F – Financial Considerations
Applicant  attributes  his  admitted
to  brief  periods  of
unemployment, the one “started May 31, 2017, to July 17, 2017.” (TR at page 34 lines
1~10.)
financial  difficulties
1.a. Applicant admits that he has a past-due debt in the amount of about $7,291,
as the result of a breach of contract with a former employer. (TR at page 21 line 21 to
page  25  line  6.)  Through  a  credit  counseling  service,  Applicant  is  making  monthly
payments of $134 towards this admitted debt, as evidenced by documentation from that
counseling service. (AppX A at page1 and AppX B at page 1.) This allegation is found
for Applicant.
1.b.  and  1.f.  Applicant  admits  that  he  has  two  past-due  debts  with  the
Department of Education totaling about $3,672. (TR at page 25 line 7 to page 27 line 2.)
In  August and  September of 2017, Applicant  was  trying  to  make monthly  payments  of
only  $5  towards  this  admitted  debt.  (Id,  and  AppX  A  at  page  2  and  AppX  B  at  pages
2~3.) This documentation also shows that Applicant was “past due” $5 on his payments.
(Id.)  Despite  having  a  month  to  do  so,  Applicant  has  submitted  nothing  further  in  this
regard. (TR at page 42 line 23 to page 43 line 19.) These allegations are found against
Applicant.
1.c.  Applicant admits that he has a past-due debt in the amount of about $1,747
to  Creditor  C.  (TR  at  page  27  line  3  to  page  28  line  10.)  Through  a  credit  counseling
service,  Applicant  is  making  monthly  payments  of  $88  towards  this  admitted  debt,  as
evidenced by documentation from that counseling service. (AppX A at page1 and AppX
B at page 1.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.d. Applicant admits that he had a past-due debt with Creditor D in the amount
of about $696, but avers that this “phone bill account . . . was paid off.” (TR at page 28
line  11  to  page  29  line  8.)  Despite  having  a  month  to  do  so,  Applicant  has  submitted
nothing further in this regard. This allegation is found against Applicant.
1.e. Applicant admits that he had past-due child support payments totaling about
$7,747. In August of 2017, this was being paid through wage garnishment. (TR at page
29 line 9 to page 31 line 14, and AppX at page 3 and AppX B at pages 4~5.) Despite
having  a  month  to  do  so,  Applicant  has  submitted  nothing  further  in  this  regard.  This
allegation is found against Applicant.
Not alleged; but admitted to by Applicant at his hearing, he is a month past due
on a car payment, and  owes about $800 in state back taxes. (TR at page 32 line 3 to
page 36 line 2.)
Guideline B – Foreign Influence
2.a,  2.b.,  and  2.d.  Applicant’s  current  spouse  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  the
Philippines. She hopes to immigrate to the United States. Their four-year-old American
son resides with Applicant’s spouse. Applicant provides financial support of about $600
every few months to his spouse. She lives with her parents. (TR at page 20 line 4~21, at
page 37 line 18 to page 40 line 17.)
2.c. Applicant’s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of the
Philippines. (TR at page 41 line 18 to page 42 line 3.) They know little about Applicant’s
employment, only that he is “a mechanic . . . [who does] work for the Military.” (Id.)
2.e. In 2012, over five years ago, Applicant gave a one-time gift of about $500 to
a  female  friend  in  the  Philippines.  (TR  at  page  40  line  18  to  page  41  line  17.)  Their
relationship was terminated years ago. (Id.)
Administrative Notice
I take Administrative Notice of the following facts regarding the Philippines: It is a
multiparty,  constitutional  republic  with  a  bicameral  legislature.  However,  dynastic
political families continue to monopolize elective offices. The U.S. Department of State
advises  all  U.S.  citizens  traveling  to  the  Philippines  to  exercise  caution  due  to  crime,
terrorism, and civil unrest. (GX 5 at pages 3~5.)
