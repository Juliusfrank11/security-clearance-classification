Applicant is a 35-year-old single woman with four children. The oldest child is a
teenager, the middle children are five-year-old twins, and the youngest is three months old.
Applicant earned an associate’s degree in health science in 2016. (Tr. 19) From August
2015 to December 2017 she worked as a medical administrative assistant. Her duties
included helping service members transfer from active duty to civilian life. (GE 1 at 12) She
left the job after her clearance was denied (Tr. 74), and was unemployed until September
2018, when she gained a part-time job as a paralegal. (Tr. 14) According to Applicant’s
supervisor when she worked as a medical administrative assistant, she was an impressive
employee who provided great care to the service members. (AE O)
The SOR alleges approximately $35,000 of delinquent debt. The debts alleged in
subparagraphs  1.a  through  1.c  are  delinquent  car  loans.  Subparagraph  1.a,  totaling
$14,233, is a loan used to finance the purchase of a car in 2011. (GE 5 at 9) She kept up
with payments for eight months until she stopped receiving child-support payments from
her oldest child’s father in December 2011. (GE 3 at 1)  The car was repossessed in 2012.
(Tr. 68)
In  September  2012,  Applicant  purchased  another  car,  financing  it  with  a  loan
secured by the creditor alleged in subparagraph 1.c. (Tr. 35; GE 3 at 2) Three months later,
she discovered that she was pregnant with her twins. By May 2013, recurring difficulties
related to the pregnancy required her to go on bedrest. (Tr. 36) Unable to work, she fell
behind on her car note. (GE 5 at 9; Tr. 33)
With  the  help  of  her  mother,  who  cosigned  the  loan,  Applicant  purchased  an
automobile  in  2015.  When  she  applied  for  the  loan,  the  loan  officer  told  her  the
delinquency on the loan, alleged in subparagraph 1.c, was too high to roll into the new car
loan.  Consequently,  he  advised  her  to  allow  the  car  secured  by  the  loan  alleged  in
subparagraph 1.c to be repossessed. (Tr. 32) Kicking the deficiency down the road would
enable her to secure a loan for the purchase of the new car. Applicant then lost her job.
Subsequently,  she  defaulted  on  the  loan,  and  the  car was repossessed, as alleged in
subparagraph 1.b. (GE 3 at 2; Tr. 32)
In  sum,  all  three  cars  that  Applicant  purchased  between  2011  and  2015  were
repossessed. In November 2017, Applicant wrote each creditor a letter with a proposed
payment  plan.  (AE  G  –  H)  Under  each  respective  plan,  she  proposed  to  satisfy  the
delinquencies with $100 monthly payments. (AE G – H) Shortly after writing the automobile
creditors, Applicant lost her job, and just regained part-time employment one month before
the hearing in September 2018. (Tr. 42, 74)  She has been unable to execute any of the
proposed payment plans.
The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.d is a loan for which Applicant applied during
the period when she was not working and on bedrest in 2013. (Tr. 42) When Applicant lost
her job, the account became delinquent in the approximate amount of $1,106. (Tr. 42-43)
Applicant contacted the creditor and agreed to a payment plan. Per the agreement, she
was to pay $140 per month. (Tr. 42) In December 2017, she lost her job, rendering her
unable to make the payments. (Tr.  42)
Subparagraph 1.e is a delinquent utility bill in the amount of $228. This delinquency
coincided with the period of time when she was not working and on bedrest. (Tr. 21) In
November 2017, Applicant contacted the creditor to arrange payment. (Tr. 44) Per the
agreement, the creditor was supposed to automatically debit her account. They never did,
and Applicant never called them again. (Tr.  45)
The creditor alleged in subparagraph 1.f is an insurance company that insured one
of the repossessed cars. (Tr. 45) The alleged delinquency is $136. Applicant disputed this
debt, contending that, per the auto insurance agreement, she always paid the insurance
payment  in  advance  of  the  month  she  received  the  insurance  coverage.  (Tr.  45)  She
successfully disputed the debt and it was removed from her credit report. (45-46)
Subparagraph  1.g  is  a  delinquent  repair  bill  owed  to  a  rental-car  company  for
damages incurred in 2010 when Applicant was in a car accident with a rental car. (Tr. 47)
The delinquency totals $2,311. She disputes the bill, contending that she opted for car
insurance, but the rental company did not include it in the contract. (Tr. 47) She provided
no evidence in support of her dispute.
Subparagraph 1.h, is a credit-card debt totaling $483. It has been delinquent since
April  2010.  (GE  2  at  5)  Applicant  satisfied  it  through  $50  monthly  payments  from
September 2015 to June 2016. (GE E at 7) She has reported payment of this debt to the
credit reporting agency and is seeking to have it removed from her credit report. (GE E at
7)
The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.i stems from  eviction-related costs from an
apartment  where  Applicant  lived  from  June  2012  to  May  2013.  (Tr.  51)  The  alleged
delinquency  totals  $3,819.  Applicant  denies  this  account,  but  provided  no  evidence  in
support of her contention that she does not owe it.
Subparagraph 1.j is an alleged delinquent hospital bill totaling $3,132. Applicant
disputed this bill, contending that she received the treatment, but her medical insurance
covered it. (Tr. 54) She contacted her insurance company, who resubmitted the insurance
information at her request. (Tr. 54) She then contacted the credit agency and had this bill
removed from her record. (AE F)
The  debt  alleged  in  subparagraph  1.k  is  a  disputed  medical  bill  totaling  $319.
Applicant contacted the credit-reporting agency and had the debt deleted from her record.
(AE F)
The  debt  alleged  in  subparagraph  1.l  is a  disputed  parking  ticket  totaling  $240.
Applicant contacted the credit agency and had it removed from her credit report. (AE F)
Since  Applicant  answered  the  SOR  and  began  reaching  out  to  creditors,  her
financial situation has worsened. Specifically, after she discovered she was pregnant with
her fourth child, her boyfriend demanded that she terminate the pregnancy. (Tr. 74) When
she refused, he kicked her out of his home. (Tr. 74-75) Although the three oldest children
stayed with him, Applicant was left without a steady home address during the period that
coincided with her unemployment. While unemployed, she was unable to follow through on
the delinquent car note payment plans, and incurred approximately $1,700 of additional
delinquent debts. (Tr. 70)
Applicant gained a part-time job in September 2018.  It pays $1,770 per month. (Tr.
14) She remains without a fixed home address. Realizing that she would not be able to
satisfy her delinquencies under these circumstances, she filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy
protection in October 2018. By January 8, 2019, the bankruptcy court had administered her
estate and closed the proceeding. (AE Q) The record does not contain the schedule of the
discharged debts.
