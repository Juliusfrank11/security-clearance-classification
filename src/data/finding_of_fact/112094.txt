Federal tax returns in a timely manner (SOR 1.a), failing to file his state income tax returns
in  a  timely  manner  (SOR  1.b), and  denied owing  a  gas  utility  bill  (SOR  1.g),  which  he
asserted he had paid. He admitted the remaining four delinquent obligation allegations.
After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.

varies. His wife operated her own business making craft items sold at craft shows. (Tr.
27, 48)
In 2011, Applicant made a job-related relocation from Texas to Florida. (Tr. 54) In
February 2015, Applicant made another job-related relocation from Florida to his current
state.  (Ex.  1,  Ex.  E,  Tr.25) On  June  26, 2017,  he filed  a 2015 part-year  resident  state
income tax return. (Ex. E, AE) He listed $61,439 state income, $2,666 of state withholding
tax, and a refund due of $2,613. (Ex. E)
On  Applicant’s  September  2015  Electronic  Questionnaires  for  Investigations
Processing  (e-QIP),  he  indicated  he  had  not  filed  his  2013  Federal  income  tax  return
because he could not locate all the documentation he needed to file the return. (Ex. 1) In
his August 2015 enhanced subject interview, he indicated he had not filed his 2013 or
2014 Federal tax returns3 because he was missing documents and planned to file the
returns  by  December  2015.  (Ex.  2)  His  tax  filings  were  further  delayed  when  his  tax
documents  were  boxed  up  when  he  moved  in  February  2015.  (Ex.  5)  He  was  in  the
process of filing his returns when things became misplaced during the move. (Tr. 22)
In November 2016, Applicant contacted the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) about
his failure to file his 2013, 2014, and 2015 returns. (Tr. 30) He was granted an extension
until December 2016 and told if he was unable to meet the deadline, he should continue
working to get his returns filed. (Ex. 5, Tr. 28) He had initially received an extension on
the 2013 Federal income tax filing due date, but that extension did not extend until the
returns were actually filed in June 2017. (Tr. 28) He did not request an extension for tax
year 2014 or 2015 because he believed he could do nothing with his 2014 or 2015 returns
until he had filed his 2013 return. (Tr. 29)
Once Applicant had obtained the bank statements and other missing document he
needed to file his 2013 return, he did so. (Tr. 30) Once his 2013 return was filed, he was
able to complete his 2014 and 2015 returns. (Tr. 30) Applicant submitted a copy of his

income tax return signed and dated June 24, 2017. (Ex. B, C, D, E, and SOR Response4)
His  2015  Federal  tax  return  listed  wages  of  $85,152,  a  $9,528  business  loss,  $5,750

In April 2013, his 2005 Honda automobile was “totaled” in the accident when he
was rear ended by an ambulance. (Tr. 21) The ambulance caved in the back end of his
vehicle. (Tr. 21) On his e-QIP, he listed medical bills of $3,200 and incurred during the
accident. (Ex. 1) He incurred $1,500 in medical bills for a rotator cuff injury, and his wife
incurred $3,500 in medical bills for a dislocated disc. (Ex. 2, Tr. 21) He did not pay the
debts because he was waiting for settlement from the ambulance company. (Ex. 2, Tr.
25) It took four years of working with the ambulance company’s insurance company to
address a portion of the medical bills. (Tr. 23)
Applicant  has  continued making  payments on  his medical  bills  and  has  paid  off
numerous medical bills. (Ex. L, N, O, X, Y, Z, AA, AB, AC) He paid more than $5,000 on

medical bills as being past due, charged-off, or in collection.

made regular payments on his student loans until 2002 when unemployment caused his
payments to become irregular. (Ex. 2, Tr. 55) At some point, he stopped making payments
until 2004, when he started making irregular payments. He continued making irregular
payments until the April 2013 automobile accident. (Ex. 2, Tr. 55) In 2015, the accounts
were again in forbearance. He requested forbearance so he could address some medical
bills. (Tr. 34, 35) In a February 2018, Applicant’s student loan services’ provided a letter
