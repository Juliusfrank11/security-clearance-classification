Applicant is a 29-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance
previously granted to him. He is employed as a weapons and communications operator
for a company in the defense industry. He has been so employed since 2011, and his
place  of  work  is  a  military  proving  ground.  His  formal  education  includes  a  bachelor’s
degree  awarded  in  2013.  He  and  his  wife  have  three  children,  ages  10,  6,  and  1.  His
employment history includes honorable service on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps
during  2006-2010,  which  included  a  deployment  to  Iraq.  His  wife  is  a  military  veteran
too.
The SOR concerns four delinquent debts consisting of two charged-off accounts
owed to the same credit union, a $1,330 collection account stemming from a credit card
account, and a $91 medical collection account for a total of about $14,059. He disclosed
the  debts  in  his  September  2016  security  clearance  application.  He  also  disclosed  a
past-due  mortgage  loan  that  had  been  resolved  by  modification  of  the  loan.  He
attributed his financial problems to the 2014 timeframe when he and his wife went from
four streams of income or paychecks to one. They had four streams of income based on
their  jobs  and  both  received  GI  Bill  benefits  as  they  were  attending  school.  The
reduction  in  income  occurred  when  he  graduated  and  his  wife  lost  her  job  and
postponed  attending  school.  They  quickly  found  themselves  over  their  heads  with  the
single  paycheck  from  Applicant’s  job.  The  status  of  the  four  delinquent  debts  is
discussed below.
Charged-off loans for $8,160 and $4,478 obtained from same credit union.2 The
initial loan was made to finance the purchase of the car, and then another personal loan

was  made,  but  it  was  secured  by  the  car  too.  After  defaulting  on  the  loans,  Applicant
voluntarily returned the vehicle, and the balances owed were charged off. The creditor
union then obtained a judgment in the amount of $13,436 plus $959 in attorney fees for
a total of $14,395 in November 2016. The judgment was paid and satisfied via a writ of
garnishment on both Applicant’s and his wife’s paychecks, and the writ of garnishment
was released in February 2018.
Collection account for $1,330. This debt stemmed from a credit card account that
was opened to finance the purchase of automobile tires. By the time the debt came to
Applicant’s attention, they were in their period of financial difficulty and unable to pay it.
Since  then,  the  balance  on  the  account  grew  to  more  than  $2,000,  which  Applicant
resolved by agreeing to pay $1,450 in May 2018.3
Medical  collection  account  for  $91.  Applicant  was  unaware  of  the  debt  until  he
submitted his 2016 security clearance application. He paid the debt in July 2017.4
In addition to the four delinquent accounts in the SOR, an April 2018 credit report
shows  an  unpaid  medical  collection  account  for  $2,197.  Applicant  explained  this  debt
stemmed  from  an  injury  he  sustained  while  operating  a  Bradley  Fighting  Vehicle  at
work.5 He understands the debt is covered by the state’s workers’ compensation system
and will be resolved in due course.6
Applicant  earned  a  gross  income  of  about  $53,000  in  2017.7  His  wife  had
recently  accepted  a  full-time  teaching  position  to  begin  in  fall  2018;  previously  she
worked  as  a  teacher’s  aide.8  He  described  their  current  financial  situation  as  “much
more stable,” he has a $1,000 set aside for an emergency fund, and their joint checking
account had a balance of about $1,500.9

Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.10
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.11  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”12  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.13 The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.14
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a  security  clearance  for  access  to  confidential,  secret,  or  top-secret  information.15  An
unfavorable  clearance  decision  (1)  denies  any  application,  (2)  revokes  any  existing
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.16
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.17  The  Government  has  the  burden  of  presenting
evidence  to  establish  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  have  been  controverted.18  An
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts  that  have  been  admitted  or  proven.19  In  addition,  an  applicant  has  the  ultimate
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.20

Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is:
Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to
protect classified or sensitive information. . .21
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;
AG  ¶  20(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  a  death,  divorce,  or
separation,  clear  victimization  by  predatory  lending  practices,  or  identity
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.  The  two
disqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.
Concerning the evidence in extenuation and mitigation, Applicant receives credit
under both AG ¶¶ 20(b) and 20(d). His financial problems stemmed from a reduction in
household  income.  In  particular,  his  wife’s  job  loss  and  her  decision  to  postpone
attending  school  (via  the  GI  Bill  benefits)  were  unexpected  events  that  resulted  in  a
reduction  of  household  income.  More  to  the  point,  Applicant  took  sufficient  action  to
resolve the four delinquent accounts in the SOR. Perhaps he could have acted sooner,
21 AG ¶ 18.
but his ability (cash flow) to do so was no doubt limited by the demands of supporting
his  spouse  and  three  children.  His  financial  situation  is  now  improved,  he  has  stable
employment,  and  his  spouse  is  transitioning  into  a  full-time  job.  Taken  together,  it
appears he has done a good job at putting his financial house in order.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent  standard,  I  have  no  doubts  or
concerns  about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to
protect  classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the
evidence  as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the
unfavorable  evidence  or  vice  versa.  I  also  considered  the  whole-person  concept.  I
conclude  that  he  has  met  his  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  show  that  it  is  clearly
consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  him  eligibility  for  access  to  classified
information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:
For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a -- 1.d:
For Applicant
Conclusion
It  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for
access to classified information.
