Applicant admitted all of the allegations with the exception of SOR ¶ 2.a, which
he denied. He is 37 years old. As of the date of the hearing, he had never been married
and he did not have any children.1
Applicant graduated from high school in 1999 and earned a bachelor’s degree in
2005. He has worked for various defense contractors since 2008. He has worked for his
current  employer,  a  defense  contractor,  since  2016.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance
since 2009.2
Applicant started consuming alcohol at age 15. In July 1999, at age 18, he was
charged with driving under the influence (DUI) (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a). This was his first DUI.
Though his blood alcohol content (BAC) was under the legal limit, he was convicted of
DUI  due  to  a  zero  tolerance  violation  for  consuming  alcohol  as  a  minor.  His  driver’s
license was suspended for six months, he was ordered to complete a six-month alcohol
program, and he was fined $100.3
In  July  2001,  at  age  20,  Applicant  was  charged  and  convicted  of  underage
possession  of  alcohol.  He  was  in  college  and  he  threw  a  party  where  alcohol  was
present.  He  was  sentenced  to  one  year  probation,  50  hours  community  service,  and
alcohol counseling (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 2.a). He completed individual alcohol counseling from
August to December 2001. During this period, he consumed beer a few times weekly.4

In  December  2005,  Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  while  intoxicated  (DWI),
BAC  .15%  to  .20%,  1st  offense.  This  was  his  second  and  last  alcohol-related  offense
while driving. He had a few drinks while watching football at a bar. As he was driving to
his  parents’  home,  he  hit  a  patch  of  ice  and  his  car  slid  into  a  ditch.  A  police  officer
asked  him  if  he  had  been  drinking  and  he  said  “Yes.”  He  was  convicted  of  reckless
driving and fined $250 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 2.a). He consumed two to three beers three to four
times weekly during this period.5
In  June  2012,  Applicant  was  disciplined  for  reporting  to  work  hungover  and
smelling  of  alcohol.  He  had  consumed  alcohol  the  night  before.  This  was  his  first  and
only alcohol-related incident at work. He was consequently involuntarily terminated from
employment in August 2012 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 2.a). He consumed six beers daily during this
period.  He  also  started  drinking  hard  liquor  in  October  2010,  after  his  long-term
relationship  of  five  years  ended;  he  found  himself  battling  depression;  he  isolated
himself;  and  he  used  alcohol  as  a  coping  mechanism.  His  mother  testified  that  she
observed Applicant begin to binge drink on the weekends in 2010, which had not been
his normal behavior. He also withdrew from participating in family events and he did not
answer her telephone calls.6
In October 2012, Applicant was  charged and convicted of drunk in public (SOR
¶¶  1.e,  2.a).  He  was  fined  $25.  He  was  walking  to  his  residence  from  a  convenience
store when the police stopped him because he was stumbling. When the police asked
him  if  he  had  been  drinking,  he  said  “Yes.”  The  police  arrested  him,  took  him  to  the
police station, and advised him to pay the fine, which he did. He consumed two beers
daily and more on the weekends from June to October 2012. He was still in denial about
his alcoholism.7
By  March  2014,  Applicant’s  level  of  alcohol  consumption  had  escalated.  He
consumed primarily hard liquor, and “more than the average person drinks in a sitting.”
He asked his mother for help and she took him to the emergency room, where he was
held  until  a  bed  was available  for  him  at  an  addiction  treatment services  program.  His
BAC was .392%. He disclosed his family history of alcoholism. For the first time and for
four  days,  he  received  inpatient  alcohol  treatment.  He  was  diagnosed  with  alcohol
dependence (SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 2.a).8
After completing treatment, Applicant was sober for one month. He then resumed
consuming alcohol. By his November 2014 background interview, he consumed alcohol
approximately  two  times  weekly  (SOR  ¶¶  1.g,  2.a).  By  April  2015,  his  alcohol
consumption had escalated to an average of eight to twelve drinks daily, prompting him
to again contact his mother for help. She helped him enroll in a 28-day inpatient alcohol

treatment program at an addiction treatment center. He received treatment through May
2015, and he was diagnosed with alcohol dependence, continuous (SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 2.a).9
Applicant  has  been  sober  since  the  day  he  entered  the  April  2015  treatment
program. Though he knew he had an issue with alcohol when he enrolled in the March
2014  treatment  program,  he  had  neither  accepted  that  he  is  an  alcoholic  nor  taken
responsibility for such knowledge and his recovery until April 2015. He testified that the
day he entered the April 2015 treatment program was:
[A] pivot point for me . . . a moment of clarity, that there was a lot more to
my  life  that  I  could  be  doing,  and  that  I  needed  to  ask  for  help.  I  found
strength  in  asking  for  help,  that  I  couldn’t  find  within,  and  I  sought
treatment that day.
During  his  final  week  at  the  2015  treatment  program,  he  was  elected  the  male
community  representative--a  role  through  which  he  helped  the  other  men  in  the
program.10
Applicant complied with the recommendations of his treatment counselor after his
2015  discharge  from  the  treatment  program:  he  attended  90  Alcoholics  Anonymous
(AA)  meetings  in  90  days;  he  obtained  an  AA  sponsor;  and  he  saw  a  licensed
professional counselor weekly. As of the date of the hearing, he was still attending AA
daily;  he  was  in  daily  contact  with  his  AA  sponsor;  he  was  also  in  daily  contact  as  a
sponsor  for  an  individual  in  recovery;  and  he  was  seeing  his  licensed  professional
counselor  weekly  to  biweekly.  In  2016,  the  counselor  diagnosed  him  with  alcohol
dependence  in  full  sustained  remission.  He  intended  to  continue  attending  AA,
remaining active in his AA community, and seeing his counselor, whom he viewed as a
coach that has taught him different coping strategies for life’s stressors.11
Applicant testified that he learned through both the 2015 treatment program and
AA that his previous failure to remain sober hinged on his thinking that he could handle
his alcoholism on his own, rather than reach out to others for help. He also learned that
“I  couldn’t  drink  safely  or  like  other  people  could,  and  that  I  was  fully  alcoholic”  and
“there  are  consequences  when  I  drink.”  A  friend  from  AA  since  2016  testified  that
Applicant is a “rock… [h]e knows what to do and he does it consistently and he does it
always.”12
Applicant signed a statement of intent in June 2018 to abstain from using alcohol
on penalty of losing his security clearance. He testified that he now has a social life, and
he  enjoys  fishing,  playing  guitar,  and  reading  books.  He  is  also  a  part  of  his  family’s

lives,  talking  to  his  mother  often,  spending  a  lot  of  time  with  his  father,  and  he  values
being involved as an uncle to four minor children.13
Applicant’s  supervisor  from  September  2016  to  December  2017  is  a  retired
brigadier  general  and  a  former  deputy  director  for  a  federal  government  agency  from
2014  to  2015.  As  of the  date  of the  hearing,  he  was  the  vice  president  for a  business
unit within the company. He testified that he first met Applicant in 2014, when Applicant
worked for him as an executive assistant in a contractor capacity until 2015, when the
witness  left  the  government  agency.  He  then  hired  Applicant  to  work  for  him  at  their
current  company  in  2016.  He  described  Applicant  as  an  outstanding  performer.  He
identified Applicant as a high potential employee and gave him a top performance rating
in 2017.14
The  witness  testified  that  he  first  became  aware  of  Applicant’s  challenges  with
alcohol  in  2014.  The  witness  testified  that  Applicant’s  mother  also  informed  him  about
Applicant’s  2015  treatment  for  alcoholism  the  day  Applicant  entered  the  program,  and
he observed Applicant’s impressive work performance when Applicant returned to work
after  completing  treatment.  The  witness  also  testified  that  he  reviewed  the  SOR,  and
Applicant  was  forthright  about  his  issues  with  alcohol  and  his  efforts  to  address  them.
While the witness was aware of Applicant’s history with alcohol, he testified that he did
not believe that anyone else at work was and that there was some speculation among
several individuals at their prior job of Applicant’s challenges. The witness testified that
he  has  seen  Applicant  on  numerous  occasions  in  social  situations  where  alcohol  is
present,  and  described  Applicant  as  firm  in  his  decision  to  not  consume  alcohol.  The
witness  indicated  that  he  had  no  doubts  that  Applicant  has  turned  his  life  around.
Numerous professional and social character references describe Applicant as a superb
employee  and  a  man  of  exemplary  character,  with  demonstrated  integrity  and
trustworthiness.15
