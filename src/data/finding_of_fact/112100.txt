The SOR alleges that Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2009 which was
dismissed in 2012, that he has 40 delinquent debts totaling $66,165, and that between
1990 and 2014, he was arrested and charged with fraudulently issuing worthless checks.
The  debts  include:  25  medical  accounts  totaling  $5,284;  mortgage-loan  arrearages  of
$9,376; deficiency balances on three repossessed vehicles totaling $37,498; an $8,222
judgment;  and  several  small  consumer  accounts.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admits  the
bankruptcy and the 25 medical debts and 8 of the other debts, denies 7 of the debts, and
admits the worthless checks charges. The debts are reflected in Applicant’s credit bureau
reports (CBR) from July 2017 and February 2017. (GX 4; GX 3.) His admissions in his
Answer are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  53-year-old  program  analyst  currently  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since October 2016, and periodically employed in the defense industry since
2007. He and his wife married in 1991 and have a 13-year-old son. This is Applicant’s
first application for a security clearance. (GX 1.)
After high school, Applicant worked for a local manufacturing plant for many years
and  was  generally  able  to  support  his  family  on  his  income.  In  1999,  Applicant’s  wife
opened her own business, which she continues to operate. Her income from the business
is minimal and unreliable, and sometimes she does not generate any income. When the
manufacturing plant closed in 2003, Applicant was initially unemployed. He worked odd
jobs and used his savings to support his family. In an effort to increase his employability,
Applicant enrolled in college in 2008. He graduated in 2012 with a bachelor’s degree, and
has been taking master’s degree level courses since June 2016. (GX 1; Tr. 18; Tr. 20-21;
Tr. 23.)
Between 2007 and 2012, Applicant worked for a federal contractor in a low-paying,
unskilled position. Due to ongoing financial strains, Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy
in  December  2009  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  From  2009  until  September  2012,  Applicant  paid
approximately  $1,500 a  month  on his  bankruptcy  payment  plan through  an  automated
payroll deduction. He was laid off from his federal contractor job in September 2012 and
was  financially  incapable  of  maintaining  the  payments  while  providing  basic  living
necessities  for  his  family.  The  bankruptcy  was  dismissed  for  noncompliance  with  the
payment plan in April 2013. (Tr. 30; GX 3.)
Applicant  was  unemployed  from  September  2012  to  February  2013;  from
September 2014 to March 2015, and from January 2016 to September 2016 (Tr. 19-20;
GX 1.) He was unable to afford health insurance during the periods of unemployment,
and primarily due to his wife’s and his son’s chronic medical issues, incurred numerous
medical debts. (Tr. 72-73.)
Applicant denies liability for the $10,201 vehicle-loan debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.w.
Applicant’s vehicle was repossessed for nonpayment after he had been laid off for more
than  10  months.  He  initially  negotiated  repayment  arrangements  with  the  creditor,
however, the creditor reneged on the agreement. (Answer.) Despite Applicant’s position
concerning this debt,  the  creditor  sent Applicant  a  1099-C  Cancellation  of  Debt,  which
Applicant properly filed and paid the appropriate taxes for the forgiven debt amount. (Tr.
39-40.) This debt has been resolved.
Applicant denies the $8,222 judgment entered against him in November 2010 by
a  merchandise-franchising  company.  (SOR  ¶  1.dd.)  Applicant  considered  entering  a
business venture with the company. The company requested Applicant’s personal contact
information for the stated purpose of sending Applicant an invitation to a vendor show. At
the show, Applicant collected information about the company, but did not sign a contract
or  make  any  other  commitments  to  enter  into  a  business  venture  with  it.  Without  his
permission, the company shipped merchandise and supplies to Applicant. He attempted,
without  success,  to  return  the  shipments.  Applicant’s  calls  and  letters  to  the  company
went unanswered or unreturned. The company eventually stopped sending merchandise
to  Applicant,  but  he  received  an  invoice  demanding  payment  for  the  merchandise  he
received and was unable to return. He refused to pay the invoice, but again stated his
willingness to return the items.
The company sought a judgment against Applicant. Applicant was served by the
sheriff, and began in earnest trying to reach representatives from the company in order
to prevent the matter from going to court. Applicant did not appear in court because he
did not understand the process or the consequences of his failure to appear. (Tr. 47-48.)
A default judgment was entered against Applicant for the full amount in November 2010.
However, the company did not pursue collection of the default judgment and the judgment
does not appear on Applicant’s July 2017 CBR. (GX 4.)
Applicant has paid $15,060, through garnishment of $200 per pay period, on the
$16,367 judgment alleged in SOR ¶ 1.ee. Applicant purchased a vehicle which never ran
properly.  He  voluntarily  relinquished  the  vehicle  to  the  seller,  which  sought  and  was
granted a judgment against Applicant for the vehicle-loan balance. (AX A; Tr. 48-49.) This
debt is being resolved.
Applicant paid the past due balance of $9,376 (SOR ¶ 1.hh) owed for his mortgage-
loan  through  a  six-month  repayment  agreement  with  the  mortgage  lender  which  was
completed in June 2017. He is occasionally late with his mortgage-loan payments, but
has not fallen into arrears since satisfying his repayment plan. (GX 4; Tr. 51- 52.) This
debt has been resolved.
In early 2018, Applicant contracted with the credit-repair firm in an effort to resolve
his delinquent accounts. Due to the high fees, Applicant terminated his relationship with
the firm and attempted to resolve his delinquent accounts on his own by contacting many
of the creditors and attempting to enter repayment plans. His efforts were not particularly
successful, and he again retained the credit repair firm in May 2018. (Tr. 37-39.) The $762
and $527 consumer debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.bb and 1.cc were paid through the credit-
repair firm. Applicant disputed the $424 consumer debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.gg and the
$200 and $70 medical debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.ll and 1.mm through the credit-repair
firm and they have been removed from Applicant’s CBR. (AX B; Tr. 32-33.)
Applicant denies the $959 and $568 cellular-telephone services debts alleged in
SOR ¶¶ 1.o and 1.p. Applicant changed service carriers with the understanding that the
new service carrier would buy out any remaining contractual obligation Applicant had with
the previous service carrier, and that both service carriers were paid in full through such
an  agreement.  Several  months  after  changing  carriers,  Applicant  received  a  list  of
charges, but no explanation, from each of the carriers. He is disputing these debts through
the credit-repair firm. (Tr. 36-38; Answer.)
Applicant has contacted the creditors of the medical debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b
through 1.n, 1.q through 1.s, 1.u, 1.v, 1.ii through 1.kk, and 1.nn, and will begin repayment
of these accounts as soon he is able. (Tr. 35-36; Tr. 38; Tr. 42.) Applicant contacted the
creditor for the $10,930 delinquent vehicle-lease debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.aa, and stated
that it was his intention to enter a repayment plan once his medical debts were resolved.
(Tr.  41.)  Applicant  contacted  the  creditor  for  the  $588  payday  loan  (SOR  ¶  1.t)  and  is
negotiating payment arrangements. The $506 past-due debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.z is for
a one-month arrearage on the vehicle loan for Applicant’s wife’s vehicle. She has regular
contact with the creditor and is working to bring this account current. (Tr. 41-42.)
Additionally,  Applicant’s  wife  periodically  failed  to  timely  file  her  quarterly  tax
returns for her business and was delinquent on her tax payments. Applicant established
a payment plan with the IRS and the IRS also withheld Applicant’s tax refunds for several
years to offset the balance due. The IRS contacted Applicant several years ago to inform
him  that  the  account  had  been  placed  in  a  non-collectible  status.  Applicant  recently
contacted the IRS and was informed that there is no current balance due. (AX F; Tr. 62-
64.)
In  1990,  2009,  and  2014,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  fraudulently
issuing worthless checks. In each instance, Applicant was experiencing financial strains
and wrote checks for necessities, usually groceries, with the intention of depositing money
into his checking account to ensure that the checks would clear. However, he was unable
to do so and the checks bounced. Applicant made full restitution and paid the requisite
court costs. Applicant never intended to commit a fraudulent or illegal act, is remorseful
about these mistakes and is actively more diligent about monitoring his checking account
balance. (Tr. 56-58.)
All of Applicant’s SOR debts were incurred prior to Applicant’s current employment,
which began in October 2016. (GX 4.) Applicant lives within his means, has not incurred
any recent delinquent debts, and is able to maintain his ongoing financial obligations as
well  as  unusual  expenses  such  as  uniforms  or  other  costs  associated  with  his  son’s
extracurricular  activities.  (Tr.  73.)  Applicant  is  also  paying  $100  a  month  for  a  $2,000
judgment  for  past-due  homeowner’s  association  dues.  When  Applicant  purchased  his
home, the seller did not disclose the requirement of homeowner’s association dues, and
it was several years before Applicant was aware of the requirement. (Tr. 24-25; Tr. 60-
61.)  Applicant  works  part  time  as  a  pastor  and  receives  a  biweekly  donation  of
approximately $200. He also sporadically earns about $100 a week when working for a
friend  with  a  lawn-care  service.  (Tr.  66-68.)  Applicant  intends  to  resolve  his  remaining
delinquent accounts. He was sincere and credible while testifying.
