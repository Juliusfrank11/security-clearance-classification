Applicant  is  45  years  old  and  married,  with  two  children.  He  earned  a  GED  in
July 1991, and a certificate from a technical/trade school in February 2002. He has held
his present employment with a defense contractor since February 2002, and is seeking
to  continue  the  security  clearance  he  has  held  since  2005  in  connection  with  that
position. He has no military service or Federal Government employment. (Item 3.)

record  evidence.  Applicant  entered
Applicant  admitted  owing  delinquent  Federal  income  taxes  for  each  year  from
2012  through  2016,  totaling  $27,578,  as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.e.  (Item  2.)
The  amounts  due  were  based  on  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  account  transcripts
that he obtained on June 5, 2017, and submitted 14 days later in his response to DOHA
interrogatories. (Item 4.) These delinquent taxes remain largely unpaid and outstanding
according
into  several  short-lived
installment/repayment  agreements  with  the  IRS  concerning  these  taxes,  which  ended
after his attempted payments were dishonored. He attributed his initial tax problems to
an  audit  of  his  2012  and  2013  tax  returns,  on  which  he  had  claimed  and  received
substantial refunds, but actually owed a combined $12,658 in unpaid taxes. He blamed
subsequent  deficiencies  on  under-withholding  and  his  family’s  routine  spending  in
excess  of  available  income.  The  five  IRS  account  transcripts  for  2012  through  2016
report total family joint adjusted gross income (AGI) of $701,395 over that period, for an
average annual AGI of $140,279. (Item 2; Item 4; Item 5.)
1  These  guidelines  were  promulgated  in  Appendix  A  of  Security  Executive  Agent  Directive  (SEAD)  4,
National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for use when rendering any final national
security  eligibility  determination.  SEAD  4  ¶  D.7  defines  “National  Security  Eligibility”  as,  “Eligibility  for
access  to  classified  information  or  eligibility  to  hold  a  sensitive  position,  to  include  access  to  sensitive
compartmented information, restricted data, and controlled or special access program information.”
Applicant also admitted owing $4,540 in delinquent state income taxes for 2012,
2013, and 2015, as alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.f through 1.h, and that the state had entered a
tax lien against him in May 2016 in the amount of $5,890. He made several payments
toward these state taxes under an installment plan, and provided a letter from the state
comptroller, dated June 5, 2017, reflecting that $4,540 remained unpaid as of that date.
Applicant  did  not  submit  evidence  of  any  additional  payments  toward  his  Federal  or
state income tax debts in his October 2017 response to the FORM. (Item 2; Item 4; Item
5; Item 7; Item 8.)
Applicant  admitted  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.j,  that  his  home  mortgage,  with  a
total  loan  balance  of  $288,895,  was  past  due  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $65,697.
These figures were based on, and are documented by, Applicant’s May 19, 2017 credit
report.  Applicant  and  his  wife  opened  this  loan  for  $295,923  in  November  2007,  with
scheduled  monthly  payments  of  $1,984.  This  was  an  FHA-guaranteed
refinancing/equity-withdrawal  loan  to  replace  the  $220,000  and  $55,000  conventional
first  and  second  mortgages  with  which  they  had  purchased  their  home  in  December
2005.  The  first  reported  delinquency  on  the  current  loan  payments  was  in  July  2014,
and  the  reported  past-due  amount  comprises  the  succeeding  33  months  of  failure  to
pay. (Item 2; Item 4; Item 6.)
Applicant’s  bankruptcy  attorney  filed  a  Chapter 13 petition for Applicant and  his
wife on July 12, 2017. The attorney explained:
The  filing  was  prompted,  in  part,  by  the  Debtors’  inability  to  negotiate  a
“short  sale”  with  the  lienholders  on  their  former  residence  located  at
[address]. The purpose of the case is to manage debts resulting from the
surrender of that property and otherwise.
He reported that the five-year Chapter 13 plan had been confirmed on October 2, 2017;
and that Applicant and his wife had been excellent clients who “have every intention of
completing their plan in the time allotted.” Their first two $936 monthly payments were
made to the trustee in August and September 2017. (AE A.)
Applicant  did  not  document  any  financial  counseling.  He  did  not  submit  the
income  and  expense  schedules  from  his  bankruptcy  filing,  or  any  other  budgetary
information, from which to analyze his future ability to comply with the bankruptcy plan
while  meeting  family  living  expenses  and  repaying  his  income  tax  delinquencies.
Applicant  offered  no  evidence  concerning  the  level of  responsibility  his  duties  entail  in
his  defense  contractor  work,  or  his  track  record  with  respect  to  handling  sensitive
information  and  observation  of  security  procedures.  I  was  unable  to  evaluate  his
credibility, demeanor, or character in person, since he elected to have his case decided
without a hearing.
