Applicant  is  38  years  old.  He  has  been  married  since  August  2015  and  has  no
children. He received a bachelor’s degree in 2005. He has worked as a federal contractor
since September 2005 and has held a security clearance since approximately 2006 or
2007.2 Applicant has worked for his current employer, as a system software engineer,
since October 2015. (Item 2)
Between March 2000 and January 2014, Applicant was arrested or charged eight
times  with various  crimes  or  infractions.  He  was  charged  with  alcohol-related  offenses
five  times.  He  was  also  charged  with  a  felony-level  destruction  of  property  offense,
reckless driving, and driving without a license. He purchased drugs in 2010, while holding
a  security  clearance,  and  he  used  marijuana  in  2014,  while  holding  a  clearance.
Additionally, Applicant falsified his February 2016 SCA regarding his criminal history and
drug use. In his initial Answer to the SOR that described these facts, Applicant denied all
of the allegations, with explanation. (Item 1, Answer)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d allege that Applicant was charged with public intoxication
four times between March 2000 and December 2002, while he was in college. He was
involved in a bar fight during one of those incidents. Applicant disclosed the September
2000 and October 2002 incidents during his March 2010 personal subject interview (PSI).
During  that  interview,  he  claimed  he  had  no  other  alcohol-related  incidents  or  arrests,
which was untrue.3 Applicant disclosed all four arrests in his December 2010 SCA, but in
his February 2016 SCA, he did not disclose the December 2002 incident.4 In his Answer,
Applicant admitted the underlying conduct, but denied the allegations. He argued that all
of  these  SOR  allegations  should  have  been  alleged  under  Guideline  G  (Alcohol
Consumption) or Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). (Item 1, Answer at 4-7; Item 2 at 54-56;
Item 3 at 6-7, 13, 22-23; Item 4 at 53-55)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleged  that,  in  February  2006,  Applicant  was  charged  with  driving
without a license, driving without registration, and driving on a suspended license. At the
time of the arrest, his license was suspended because he had several outstanding parking
tickets and he did not have the funds to register his vehicle. He was found guilty and spent
three  days  in  jail.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  denied  the  allegation,  but  admitted  the
underlying conduct. (Item 1, Answer at 7-8; Item 3 at 5-6, 13, 21; Item 4 at 53)
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleged  that  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  felony-level
destruction of property in July 2009. He claimed that early in the morning, after he left a
club, he was assaulted by a group of young men. His girlfriend, who was with him, called
2 Applicant was briefly unemployed between July 2010 and October 2010.
3  Because  Applicant’s  failure  to  tell  the  truth  to  the  investigator  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  I  will  only
consider this information as a factor in evaluating credibility, mitigation, and whole–person factors.

SOR, I will only consider this information as a factor in evaluating credibility, mitigation, and whole–person
factors.
the police, and they gave statements. After the police left the scene, the men returned,
and Applicant broke the window of their vehicle. He was subsequently arrested, but the
charges were dismissed by a judge the next day. Applicant disclosed this arrest in his
February 2016 SCA. In his Answer, Applicant denied the allegation, and the underlying
criminal conduct. Additionally, he argued that the incident should have been alleged under
Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). (Item 1, Answer at 8; Item 2 at 52-53; Item 3 at 4-5, 13,
22; Item 4 at 52-53; Item 6 at 4)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleged that, in September 2010, Applicant purchased cocaine in the
form  of  a  “Thai  stick”.  He  was  not  employed  at  this  time,  but  he  still  held  a  security
clearance. He disclosed information regarding this incident in his December 2010 SCA,
and  during  his  2011  PSI,  and  2017  PSI.  While  Applicant  was  in  Las  Vegas  with  his
girlfriend  on  vacation,  they  attempted  to  identify  drug  users  on  the  street  by  the  way
people appeared, and they decided to see if they could purchase drugs from a stranger.
Applicant  asked  the  strangest  person  he  saw  if  he  could  purchase  cocaine  from  him.
When the person said yes, Applicant claimed he told the individual that he was just joking,
because he did not really intend to purchase drugs. However, according to Applicant, the
individual made Applicant go to an ATM and withdraw money for the cocaine. After the
sale was completed, Applicant claimed he destroyed the cocaine and did not use it. In his
Answer, Applicant admitted the underlying conduct, but claimed he was coerced into the
purchase. Additionally, he claimed that this incident occurred in September 2012, which
is inconsistent with his disclosures in his 2010 SCA and 2011  PSI. Applicant asserted
that  this  allegation  should  have  been  alleged  under  Guideline  H  (Drug  Involvement  or
Substance Abuse) (Item 1, Answer at 8-9; Item 2 at 57-59; Item 3 at 14, 24, 28)
SOR ¶ 1.h alleged that, in June 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with
driving  while  intoxicated,  first  offense;  driving  under  the  influence  (DUI);  and  operating
while impaired. He did not disclose this arrest in his 2016 SCA. During his February 2017
PSI,  the  investigator  confronted  Applicant  regarding  his  arrest  history  twice,  before  he
questioned Applicant about this arrest.5 Applicant told the investigator that after leaving a
bar, he ran a red light, and was pulled over by law enforcement. According to Applicant,
he  passed  the  field  sobriety  test,  but  was  arrested  and  taken  to  the  police  station.  He
claimed he never heard anything from the arresting agency after the arrest. Applicant told
the investigator that he thought the incident was outside the reporting period. Additionally,
he stated he was unaware that he was charged with an offense or that the arrest would
be on his record. In his Answer, Applicant denied the allegation, because he claimed he
passed the field sobriety tests. (Item 1, Answer at 9-10; Item 3 at 28; Item 6 at 4-5)
SOR ¶ 1.i alleged that, in November 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged
with reckless driving. He pled guilty to this charge in March 2014, and was ordered to pay
a $500 fine and costs. Applicant did not disclose this arrest in his 2016 SCA, or during

I will only consider this information as a factor in evaluating credibility, mitigation, and whole–person factors.
the January 2017 PSI or February 2017 PSI.6 In his Answer to the SOR, he denied the
allegation, and claimed the arresting officer did not use a radar gun; therefore, there was
no evidence that his speeding rose to the level of reckless driving. He asserted that the
underlying conduct should have been alleged under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). (Item
1, Answer at 9-10; Item 3; Item 5 at 1)
SOR ¶ 1.j alleged that Applicant used marijuana, multiple times during the summer
of 2014, while holding a security clearance. He told the government investigator that he
used marijuana with his siblings and their spouses. In his Answer, he denied the allegation
because he believed the underlying conduct should have been alleged under Guideline
H (Drug Involvement or Substance Misuse). Additionally, he claimed he no longer uses
marijuana. (Item 3 at 23-24)
SOR ¶¶ 1.k through 1.m alleged that in his February 2016 SCA, Applicant failed to
disclose the June 2012 DUI arrest, the January 2014 reckless driving arrest, and his 2014
use of marijuana. During his February 2017 PSI, Applicant told the investigator that he
did not disclose his 2014 marijuana use in his February 2016 SCA because he forgot that
he used marijuana in 2014. In his Answer, Applicant denied the allegations, because he
claimed he was “rushing when he completed the form.” (Item 3 at 28)
In his supplemental Answer to the SOR and FORM, Applicant claimed he did not
disclose  the  June  2012  DUI  arrest  and  2014  drug  use  in  his  2016  PSA  because  he
misunderstood the term, “charged and convicted,” which does not appear in the question
to  which  he  falsely  responded.  He  also  claimed  he  did  not  disclose  the  2014  reckless
driving arrest because he did not know he was fined more than $300. (AE A)
During Applicant’s March 2010 PSI, Applicant discussed his earlier disclosure of
drug  use  that  included  use  of  marijuana  approximately  three  times  in  October  2000,
mushrooms two times in April 2001, and ecstasy twice in October 2001. Applicant told
the investigator that he did not intend to try or experiment with drugs ever again. During
his March 2011 PSI, Applicant reaffirmed the extent of his previous drug use, and claimed
that he did not intend to ever use drugs again.7 (Item 3 at 8-9, 14-15)
In  January  2017,  Applicant  was  confronted  by  an  investigator  regarding  the  full
extent of his drug history. He admitted he used marijuana three times between 1995 and
2003;  he  used  mushrooms  six  times  between  March  2000  and  March  2004;  he  used
ecstasy five times between October 2001 and March 2003; and he used cocaine once in
2000.8 (Item 3 at 23-24)
6 Because Applicant’s failure to disclose this arrest to the investigator was not alleged in the SOR, I will only
consider this information as a factor in evaluating credibility, mitigation, and whole–person factors.
7 Because Applicant’s failure to be truthful regarding his drug use during his PSIs was not alleged in the
SOR, I will only consider this information as a factor in evaluating credibility, mitigation, and whole–person
factors.
8 Because Applicant’s involvement with drugs prior to 2010 was not alleged in the SOR, I will only consider
this information as a factor in evaluating credibility, mitigation, and whole–person factors.
Applicant  submitted  three  employment-related  awards  and  an  October  2017
certificate that he completed a drug and alcohol course. He also submitted two letters of
recommendation. There is no evidence as to whether Applicant disclosed his 2014 arrest
and 2014 drug use to his facility security officer or company. (Item 1, Answer at 19, 20,
22-25)
