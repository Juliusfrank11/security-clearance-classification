Applicant is 49 years old, married (since1997), and has two children, a daughter age
20 (who attends an American university) and a son age 16 (who is in high school). Applicant
was born Egypt and took his bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering in 1991 from an Egyptian
university.  He  arrived  in  the  United  States  in  2009  and  promptly  obtained  a  green  card
(Permanent U. S. Resident). He was naturalized in 2015. Because his children were minors
living with him when Applicant was naturalized, they are now U.S. citizens. Applicant took
a Master’s in Business Administration from a U. S. university in 2016. From May 2012 until
July  2016,  he  worked  for  a  defense  contractor.  In  July  2016,  Applicant  formed  his  own
company  and  is  now  self-employed.  He  specializes  in  construction  and  project
management. He continues to do work for his former employer. Applicant has worked on
federal government projects, including embassy construction, since 1995. While working for
his former employer, Applicant surrendered his Egyptian passport in 2015 or 2016. When
he travels, he uses only his U. S. passport.1
The SOR alleged that Applicant has family members who are citizens and residents
of Egypt and that Applicant has property interests in Egypt. More specifically, as to family
members, the SOR alleged that Applicant’s: (1) mother is a citizen and resident of Egypt
and  a  retired  pharmacist  for  the  department  of  health;  (2)  two  sisters  are  citizens  and
residents of Egypt and that one is a teacher at a technological academy and the other is a
diplomat for the Egyptian government; (3) mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Egypt
and a retired pharmacist for the Ministry of Health ; (4) sister-in-law and brother-in-law are
physicians, the former employed by the department of health and the latter retired from the
department of health.2 Applicant admitted those allegations with explanations, upon which
he elaborated at the hearing.3

As  to  property  interests  in  Egypt,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant:  (1)  owns  two
apartments; (2) co-owns a home with his mother and two sisters; (3) has bank accounts
and  bank  certificates  of  varying  values;  (3)  has  two  bank  accounts  maintained  by  his
spouse.4 Applicant admitted those allegations with explanations, upon which he elaborated
at the hearing.5
Applicant stated in his Answer that when he became a permanent resident in 2009,
his long-time goal and passion was to become a U. S. citizen along with his wife and children
and to serve this nation with honor and dignity. He reiterated those sentiments in his hearing
testimony. Applicant wanted his children to live in the United States and be educated here.
When  he  became  a  U.  S.  citizen,  he  pledged  complete,  undivided,  and  unconditional
allegiance to this country. Applicant could never be manipulated, coerced, or induced to do
anything that would be against the interests of the United States.6
In all of Applicant’s years working on federal government projects (since 1995), he
has never had any security violations or any disciplinary issues. If he learned that one or
more  of  his  family  members  in  Egypt  were  being  exploited  to  compromise  our  national
security through him, Applicant would report it his Facility Security Officer (FSO) and other
appropriate authorities. He has been briefed on the appropriate reporting requirements in
such a situation.7
Applicant’s character witnesses vouched for his exemplary character. The witnesses
each had personal knowledge of Applicant. They had known him from as far back as 2006,
2009,  and  2012.  They  each  knew  the  security  concerns  that  prompted  this  hearing.
Applicant was described as “honest” and “trustworthy,” “reliable” with “great integrity.” Those
positive qualities were also expressed in the character letters submitted by Applicant. 8
Applicant  testified  about  his  family  members  in  Egypt.  His  mother  retired  as  a
pharmacist about 15 or 16 years ago. She is 87. Applicant does not provide any financial
support to his mother. She has no ties to the Egyptian government and was not required to
join any political party to work in the department of health. Applicant visits her about once a
year. His mother knows nothing about him seeking a security clearance. She  only knows
that Applicant does construction engineering but not exactly what his job entails. She only

knows that at some point Applicant was working on an embassy project. He speaks to his
mother about once a week.9
One of his sisters, a chemical engineer, teaches science and chemistry at the Arab
Academy for Science and Technology. The Academy is a private school. Applicant’s sister
has no ties to the Egyptian government or the military.
Applicant’s other sister has an administrative position with the Egyptian consulate in
Bahrain.  It  is  not  a  political  appointment  but  is  a  civil  service  position.  His  sisters  know
nothing  about  him  seeking  a  security  clearance.  They  only  know  that  Applicant  does
construction engineering but not exactly what his job entails. They only know that at some
point Applicant was working on an embassy project. He speaks to them about every two to
four weeks. Applicant sees them when he visits his mother about once every year.10
Applicant sees his mother-in-law about once a year, when he visits his mother. His
mother-in-law has no ties to the Egyptian government or military. She does not know about
Applicant seeking a security clearance and does not know about his work for the United
States government. He speaks to her about every two to three weeks. Applicant has never
given his mother-in-law any financial support.11
Applicant’s sister-in-law is a physician with the Ministry of Health. She specializes in
infection control. Her spouse is a retired physician from the Ministry of Health. He has been
retired for about seven to eight years. Applicant visits his sister-in-law  when he visits his
mother.  Other  than  that  he  speaks  with  his  sister-in-law  about  once  a  month  or  less.
Applicant  speaks  only  infrequently  to  her spouse.  Applicant  has never provided  financial
support  to  his  sister-in-law  or  her  spouse.  She  and  her  spouse  have  no  ties  to  the
government or the military. They do not know about Applicant’s application for a security
clearance or the work he does for the United States government.12
Applicant testified about his real property and financial holdings in Egypt. He owns
two apartments. The first apartment (Apt. 1) was alleged to be worth about $70,000.13 That
is not currently an accurate evaluation of Apt. 1. Applicant sold that property in July of this

year because he no longer needed it and could use the proceeds on the new home he is
buying here. The sale price was $49,000.14
The second apartment (Apt. 2) was alleged to be worth about $125,000.15 That is not
currently an accurate evaluation of Apt. 2. Because of the economic situation in Egypt and
the depreciation of the Egyptian pound, Applicant estimated that its current value is between
$60,000 and $70,000. Apt. 2 was a gift from his father (now deceased). Egyptian custom is
that  the  father  gives  his  son  the  gift  of  an  apartment  (if  he  can  afford  it).  In  any  event,
Applicant has not tried to sell Apt. 2, because he wants to keep it as a place to stay when
he and his family visit.16
Along with his mother and his two sisters, Applicant is a co-owner of a home that was
alleged to be worth approximately $15,000.17 That is not currently an accurate evaluation.
Because of the depreciation of the Egyptian pound and that the home’s roof has collapsed,
it  is  now  worth  about  $8,000.  Of  that  value,  Applicant’s  mother  would  take  the  first  one-
eighth, Applicant would take half of the remainder, with his sisters sharing the other half of
the remainder. That works out to be about $3,500 going to Applicant.18
Applicant  testified  about  his  two  bank  accounts  alleged  to  have  a  value  of  about
$40,000.19 Applicant testified that he closed those two accounts, one in 2016 and the other
in 2017.20
Applicant testified about his bank certificates and savings bonds alleged to be worth
about  $16,000.21  The  value  of  those  instruments  have  depreciated  to  less  than  half  that
amount  because  of  the  depreciation  of  the  Egyptian  pound.  They  are  now  worth  about
$6,000. Those instruments are in Egyptian pounds, which makes it very hard to convert to
U.  S.  dollars.  When  economic  conditions  improve,  Applicant  intends  to  close  those
accounts.22

Applicant testified about the bank certificates alleged to be worth about $16,000.23
These were gifts from Applicant’s mother-in-law to his two children. Again, because of the
depreciation  of  the  Egyptian  pound,  those  certificates  are  now  worth  about  $7,000  or
$8,000. Those certificates are in the name of his children.24
Applicant  testified  about  the  two  bank  accounts  his  wife  maintains  in  Egypt,  one
alleged to have a value of about $14,000 and the second with a value of about $50,000.25
His wife closed the first account in July of this year. The second account has been devalued
due to the depreciation of the Egyptian pound. It is now worth about $23,000 to $27,000.26
By  my  calculation,  Applicant’s  Egyptian  assets  alleged  in  SOR  totaled  $354,000.
Based on Applicant’s testimony, either by closing some of those accounts or by virtue of
currency devaluation (or a combination of both), his current Egyptian assets total between
$149,000  and  $163,500.27  Of  that  amount,  $7,000  to  $8,000  are  gifts  (bank  certificates)
from his mother-in-law to his two children, which are held in their names, not Applicant’s
name.28
Applicant’s  average  salary  is  between  $180,000  and  $190,000  annually,  although
this year his business has picked up and he might make between $250,000 and $300,000.29
Applicant’s  wife  is  a  civil  engineer  for  a  defense  contractor,  and  she  makes  between
$140,000 and $150,000 a year including a bonus.30 Applicant has a 401k plan with about
$37,000  to  $38,000  in  it.31  He  and  his  wife  own  their  home,  which  is  valued  between
$530,000 and $540,000. They are buying a new home, closing at the end of August this
year.  It  is  valued  at  $950,000.32  Applicant’s  combined  bank  accounts  (business  and
personal) total between $512,000 and $519,000.33 He estimated that his U.S. assets total

Egypt
Egypt is a geopolitical partner of the United States, and those two countries have
had strong economic and security relationships since 1979. They have worked in tandem
to combat global terrorism and violent extremism. In 2015, Egypt and the United States
held a Strategic Dialogue to strengthen the security cooperation between them.
The United States Department of State warns U.S. citizens of threats from terrorist
groups in Egypt and to consider the risks of travel to the country. U.S. citizens have been
kidnapped  and  murdered  by  terrorist  and  extremist  groups.  Several  terrorist  groups,
including  ISIS,  have  committed  multiple  deadly  attacks  in  Egypt,  targeting  government
officials,  security  forces,  public  venues,  tourist  sites,  civil  aviation  and  other  modes  of
public transportation, along with diplomatic facilities. U.S. citizens remain at risk as ISIS
uses  kidnapping  for ransom to finance  their  operations.  Due  to  security  concerns,  U.S.
diplomatic  personnel  are  prohibited  from  travel  to  parts  of  Egypt  and  U.S.  citizens  are
warned to avoid those areas.
Extremist  organizations  operate  in  Egypt  and  ISIS  has  called  on  supporters  to
attack  U.S.  citizens  and  coalition  partners.  ISIS  media  has  threatened  that  places
associated  with  Westerners,  Christians,  the  Egyptian  military  and  police,  and  Egyptian
government facilities  could be  struck at any  time.  Authorities  believe  there  is continued
likelihood  of  such  potential  attacks.  These  terrorist  groups  use  conventional  and
nonconventional weapons to target U.S. Government interests and private interests.
Egypt’s  human  rights  problems  involve  the  excessive  use  of  force  by  security
forces, including unlawful killings and torture; and deficiencies in due process, including
excessive  use  of  preventive  custody  and  pretrial  detention,  use  of  military  courts  to  try
civilians, trials of hundreds of defendants in which authorities did not present evidence on
an  individual  basis,  suppression  of  civil  liberties,  including  societal  and  government
restrictions on freedom of expression, the press, and peaceful assemble and association.
There are also problems with arbitrary arrests; a politically motivated judiciary; restrictions
on  academic  freedom;  impunity  for  security  forces;  limits  on  religious  freedom;  and
violence, harassment, and societal discrimination against women and girls.35
