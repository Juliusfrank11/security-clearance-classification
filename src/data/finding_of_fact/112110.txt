Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. Her SOR answer is incorporated in my
findings  of  fact.  She  contends  that  she  would  not  deliberately  or  intentionally  falsify  a
government form, and she has not been arrested for over five years, and has worked on
a military installation with a CAC credential for over one year.
Background Information
Applicant  is  40  years  old.  She  has  been  employed  -  using  her  CAC  since
December 12, 2016 by a federal contractor, aboard a military installation. (AE B, Tr. 24)
Applicant  graduated  high  school  in  1996  and  had  some  college  courses.  She  was
1 Department Counsel’s briefcase was sidetracked en route to the hearing. I left the record open for him to
submit  the  GEs,  which  had  already  been  provided  in  discovery,  to  Applicant.  I  also  allowed  time  for
Applicant to object. She did not raise an objection.
married in 2004, and recently separated in 2015. She had no children by that marriage,
but  she  has  a  25-year  old  son  who  still  lives  with  her.  (Tr.  24-25)  She  is  profoundly
disabled. She seeks CAC eligibility as a condition of her continued employment. (GE 1;
Tr. 10)
The  SOR  alleges  in  ¶  1  several  minor  offenses  or  infractions  committed  by
Applicant  between  2008  and  2013.  SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  she  was  charged  with  reckless
driving on March 29, 2013. Applicant admitted this and testified that she drove off at a
high rate of speed after a dispute with her husband. (Tr. 24) SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c allege
Applicant was arrested on April 27, 2012, for theft by deception for passing bad checks
under $50, and other bad checks under $10. She admitted to both and testified that it
was one arrest but she was subsequently found guilty on all counts. (Tr. 15-16) SOR ¶
1.d  alleges  that  on  January  14,  2011,  Applicant  gave  a  false  name  to  a  police  officer,
and she was also charged with possession of marijuana (MJ) and drug paraphernalia.
She  admitted  these  allegations  and  she  was  sentenced  to  20  days  (served  over  10
weekends)  in  jail.  (Tr.  28)  Applicant  testified  that  she  went  out  to  walk  her  dog  in  the
middle of the night and discovered a police officer hiding in her bushes. She was scared
and refused to provide her correct name and address. (Tr. 29) Within minutes, several
police officers showed up and entered her home to find a remnants of an MJ cigarette,
and  MJ  residue  in  an  ashtray.  (Tr.  31)  She  claimed  that  the  MJ  belonged  to  her
husband  and  cousin.  I  did  not  find  this  testimony  to  be  credible.  She  pled  guilty  to  all
charges. (Tr. 31-32)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant was arrested for cruelty to animals on May 21, 2010.
She testified that she came home from work to discover her dog missing. She conferred
with her son and they determined that the dog was mysteriously taken by animal control
officers, from inside the home, because it was deprived of water. (Tr. 33-34) Applicant
offered few details of this taking, and I did not find her to be complete or credible.
Applicant’s earliest arrests were for harassing communications on April 14, 2008,
and  again  on  April  30,  2008.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.f  and  1.g)  She  testified  that  both  arrests
stemmed  from  a  dispute  with  another  woman  with  whom  Applicant’s  husband  was
cheating.  (Tr.  36)  This  interloper  supposedly  followed  Applicant  everywhere.  So,
Applicant threatened to beat her up and the woman reported this to police. (Tr. 37-38)
Applicant  testified  that  a  restraining  order  was  entered  mandating  that  she  stay  away
from  the  woman  for  six  months  and  then  the  charges  were  dismissed.  (Tr.  38).
Applicant  has  no  additional  arrests  since  2013.  Applicant  provided  two  positive
character-reference letters attesting to her hard work and kindness. (AE A and B) She
notes  that  she  is  in  good  standing  with  her  employer,  which  made  special
accommodations for her.
When Applicant  completed  her  Declaration for  Federal  Employment (Form  306)
on  December  12,  2016,  she  answered  yes  to  item  9,  which  asked  “During  the  last  7
years,  have  you  been  convicted,  been  imprisoned,  been  on  probation,  or  been  on
parole?” (GE 2, Tr. 40) However, she only disclosed the 2012 check offenses and the
2011 arrest for providing false information to a policeman. She filled out the Form 306 in
a classroom setting. She testified that it was not her intent to falsify a government form.
(Tr.  19-20)  She  simply  forgot  about  all  the  various  misdemeanors.  In  particular,  she
forgot  to  list  the  only  offense  for  which  she  went  to  jail  at  SOR  1.d.  The  only  reason
Applicant could ascribe for her omissions was “simple forgetfulness.” (Tr. 42)
