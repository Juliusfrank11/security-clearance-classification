Applicant is 50 years old. He obtained a bachelor’s degree in 1991 and a master’s
degree  in  2002.  (Tr.  10-12)  Applicant  was  married  in  1992,  divorced  in  2006,  and  he
remarried  in  2009.  He  reports  two  children  and  two  stepchildren  from  his  wife’s  first
marriage.  He  previously  served  as  a  police  officer  in  a  small  town  from  1995  to  2002.
Applicant has been employed as an information technology (IT) professional by a federal
contractor since September 2015. Applicant reports no military service, and he has held a
security clearance since 2006. (Tr. 18-20)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges under Guideline M that in 2015, Applicant violated his employer’s
information protection acceptable-use policy by viewing child-pornography images on his
company’s laptop computer. A second allegation at SOR ¶ 2.a asserts that Applicant was
terminated from his employment on August 20, 2015, as a result. SOR ¶ 2.b alleges that
Applicant failed to disclose this derogatory information during an interview on December
19,  2016,  with  an  authorized  investigator  for  DOD.  SOR  ¶  2.c  cross-alleges  the  same
misconduct under SOR ¶ 1.a and raises a concern under Guideline E, personal conduct.
The basis for these allegations is an August 19, 2015 letter of termination from the vice
president of his company (GE 4), and Applicant’s answers to interrogatories dated July 31,
2017, with an attached two-page statement clarifying the summary of his personal subject
interview (PSI) conducted by an authorized investigator on December 19, 2016 (GE 3).
Applicant was terminated from his employment by a previous federal contractor on
August 19, 2015. (Tr. 21) He testified that he was called in by his supervisors in June 2015,
and told that inappropriate images had been found on his work laptop computer. Applicant
admitted he had viewed adult pornography on this laptop. They took his laptop away and
provided him with another loaner laptop. (Tr. 34) Applicant was called in again on August
19,  2015.  He  vehemently  denied  ever  downloading,  accessing,  or  viewing  child
pornography-images on his work laptop computer. (Tr. 45) He did not ever see the offensive

clearance application (SCA) (GE 1).
images  obtained  by  his  employer,  but  was  told  that  his  laptop  contained  inappropriate
images. He was terminated after 13 ½ years with that employer, and he did not appeal. (Tr.
45)  Applicant  had  taken  computer-security  courses  and  training  and  he  knew  that  the
company prohibited viewing adult pornography on work computers. (Tr. 50, 83)
Applicant  lived  with  his  wife  and  four  children  in  2015.  Local  police  obtained  and
executed a search warrant at his house in March 2016 seeking evidence of a computer
crime. (Tr. 36) Since the internet service provider (ISP) subscription at that address was in
Applicant’s name, he was interviewed first by the police. He vehemently denied viewing or
downloading child-pornography images on his laptop computer. When Applicant’s 17-year-
old stepson was interviewed separately, he admitted downloading the compressed files of
pornographic images of his minor girlfriend on his computer. (Tr. 39, AE A) The stepson
went  to  court  and  pled  guilty  to  a  reduced  charge  of  computer  harassment.  He  was
sentenced to two years of probation and therapy, which he completed, and the conviction
was expunged. (Tr. 40-41) Applicant never gave anybody else his password or computer
access card (CAC) card to access his work laptop computer. (Tr. 43)
In a December 19, 2016, personal subject interview (PSI), a clearance interviewer
went  through  the  various  sections  of  Applicant’s  June  2014  SCA  and  asked  Applicant
questions.  Applicant  told  her  that  he  voluntarily  resigned  from  his  employment  in  2015
because he did not like the contract. (Tr. 56) Applicant testified that this was a snap decision
and he lied to her because he was embarrassed. Applicant wholeheartedly regrets this and
the ensuing falsifications in sections 13 (c) (employment record) and 27 (use of information
technology  systems)  of  the  same  SCA.  (Tr.  57)  Applicant  was  not  forthcoming  with  the
clearance interviewer about derogatory information in his background. Applicant testified
that he viewed adult pornography on his work laptop for three years starting in 2012, and
he last viewed adult pornography in 2015. (Tr. 77, 81)
