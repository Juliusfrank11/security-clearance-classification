Applicant has a history of criminal behavior, primarily related to substance abuse.
She  started  smoking  marijuana  in  about  1978  while  in  high  school.  She  continued
periodically  using  marijuana  until  about  2014.  She  told  a  background  investigator  in
September 2016 that she smoked marijuana on a weekly basis, off and on, from 1978
until she stopped smoking marijuana in 2014. She was interviewed again in May 2017,
and  provided  similar  information.  She  stated  that  she  did  not  use  marijuana  at  all
between  1992  and  1995,  and  then  smoked  marijuana,  with  some  breaks  of  weeks  or
months,  until  2014.  In  her  response  to  the  SOR,  she  wrote  that  she  stopped  using
marijuana  in  1984,  and  then  resumed  after  decades  of  abstinence  “for  medicinal
purposes  only”  for  her  bad  back.  She  testified  that  she  only  smoked  marijuana
occasionally, maybe once every year or two with her friends, with her most recent use in
about 2012. She later testified that her marijuana use varied from about once a month
to about once every two to three months, with a period of abstinence of about eight to
nine years. (Tr. at 25-28, 51-57; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  1990  and  charged  with  possession  of  a  controlled
substance. The controlled substances were marijuana and methamphetamine. She was
convicted  of  the  charge  and  sentenced  to  30  days  in  jail,  which  was  suspended,  and
probation for 24 months. (Tr. at 23-24, 34-38; GE 2, 3)
Applicant was arrested for assault in 2000. She stated that she was drunk, got in
a  fight  with  her  ex-husband,  and  “poked”  him  with  a  pair  of  scissors.  The  District
Attorney’s Office declined to prosecute. (Tr. at 23, 38-40; GE 3)
Applicant was arrested in 2004 and charged with criminal mischief and disorderly
conduct. She testified that she had been drinking, and she set her ex-husband’s clothes
on  fire  on  the  lawn.  She  thought  the  charges  were  dismissed.  However,  the  FBI
identification  record  indicates  that  she  was  convicted  of  the  offenses.  She  was
sentenced  to  six  months  in  jail  (suspended)  and  a  $500  fine  for  the  criminal  mischief
offense; and ten days in jail and a $100 fine ($50 suspended) for the disorderly conduct
offense. (Tr. at 23, 40-41; GE 3)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  2006  for  injury  to  property.  She  stated  that  she
accidently broke her sister’s window. Her sister was angry at her for an unrelated matter
and called the police. Applicant paid for the window, and charges were either never filed
or dismissed. (Tr. at 22-23, 42-43; GE 3)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  2011  and  charged  with  driving  under  the  influence
(DUI).  She  pleaded  guilty  to  impaired  driving.  She  was  sentenced  to  180  days  in  jail,
with 178 days suspended; probation for 12 months; 48 hours of community service; and
a  fine.  Applicant  does  not  believe  she  was  too  drunk  to  drive.  She  asserted  that  she
only had one beer. She admitted it was a large beer of about 32 ounces. She stated that
her blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was .04%. (Tr. at 20-22, 43-47; GE 2, 3)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  June  2015  and  charged  with  disorderly  conduct  and
trespassing  on  private  property.  She  paid  a  fine,  and  was  ordered  to  complete
community service. The charges were then nolle prosequi (dismissed). She stated that
she and a friend were in a bar in a resort town. Her friend became extremely intoxicated
and was yelling and screaming. The hotel they were staying at  attempted to kick them
out. They were subsequently arrested. (Tr. at 20, 47-49; GE 2, 3)
Alcohol  played  a  significant  role  in  Applicant’s  criminal  record.  She  stated  that
she rarely drinks anymore, and then only in moderation. She has not been arrested or
charged  with  anything  since  the  June  2015  arrest.  Applicant  moved  to  her  current
location  in  2014  to  live  with  her  son  who  is  in  the  military.  He  has  been  a  positive
influence  on  her,  and  she  no  longer  associates  with  a  bad  crowd.  He  has  noticed  a
change  in  her  and  believes  that  she  is  honest,  loyal,  and  not  a  threat  to  national
security. (Tr. at 28-29, 49, 58-62; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
April  2016.  She  reported  her  2011  DUI  and  her  2015  arrest  for  disturbing  the  peace
(disorderly  conduct).  She  denied  any  involvement  with  illegal  drugs  in  the  previous
seven  years.  Applicant  told  the  background  investigator  that  it  was  unintentional,  and
she  must  have  misread  the  question.  She  testified  that  she  did  not  list  her  marijuana
use because she “wasn’t a big-time marijuana smoker. It was an occasional thing, and
[she]  didn’t  think  it  would  be a big  deal.” She  also  indicated  that  she  is  “not  good  with
words . . . . [She] didn’t leave it out on purpose. [She] just didn’t know how to word it.”

The  SOR  alleges  two  defaulted  student  loans  and  a  $370  delinquent  medical
debt. Applicant rehabilitated the student loans, and they are in good standing. She was
jointly responsible for her ex-husband’s medical debt. He was supposed to pay it. It is
not reflected on the two most recent credit reports in evidence. (Tr. at 33-34; GE 4-6)
