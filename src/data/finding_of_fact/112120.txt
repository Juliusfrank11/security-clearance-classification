Applicant is a 43-year-old software engineer. He is married to his second wife, and
has a Bachelor of Science degree. He is seeking to obtain national security eligibility for
a security clearance in connection with his work with the DoD.
Applicant  has  severe  physical  issues  that  have  resulted  in  periods  where  he
received  disability  while  recovering.  He  was  basically  unemployed  between  2005  and
2011 due to his physical issues. During that time he attended college. Applicant worked
full time from 2013 to 2015, when he again went on disability.  He was unemployed for
about  a  year  before  obtaining  work  with  his  current  employer  in  October  2016.  He
returned to disability in August 2017, and was on disability at the time of the hearing. He
returned  to  work  in  June  2018.  When  on  disability  Applicant  makes  about  60%  of  his
salary. Applicant contends his physical problems have caused the majority of his financial
issues. (Government Exhibits 1 at Section 26, and 2; Applicant Exhibits L and N; Tr. 17-
19, 26, 31-32, 35-36, 64-66.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline F – Financial Considerations)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he has a history of past-due indebtedness that can raise questions about his
reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.
Applicant  admitted all  the  allegations  set forth  in  the  SOR  with  the  exception  of
subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.g, and 1.x.1  The total amount of money Applicant is alleged to
owe is approximately $31,000. The existence and amount of the debts is documented by
credit reports dated March 24, 2017; and March 15, 2018. (Government Exhibits 4 and
5.) (See Government Exhibit 1 at Section 26.)
1.a. Applicant admitted filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2004. The debts included
an automobile loan, medical bills, and student loans. Applicant received a discharge in
bankruptcy  on  February  14,  2005.  Given  the  length  of  time  since  Applicant  filed  this
bankruptcy, I find that it has no current security significance and this allegation is found
for Applicant. (Government Exhibit 3; Tr. 19, 30-31.)
1.b. Applicant denied he was indebted for past-due child support in the amount of
$5,369.  Applicant  submitted  documentation  showing  that  he  had  paid  all  the  past-due
child support and a lien filed by the county had been lifted. In addition, the credit reports
show  that  Applicant’s  payments  were  timely  and  that  he  paid  as  agreed.  This  debt  is
resolved. (Answer; Government Exhibits 4 and 5; Applicant Exhibits B and D; Tr. 19-20,
34, 65-66.)
1.c. Applicant denied that he owed a creditor $3,680 for a judgment from 2013.

Paragraph 2 (Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  used  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  all  three  allegations  under  this
paragraph.
2.a and 2.b. Applicant purchased marijuana once, and used it several times during
a single month in 2013. At that time Applicant was in severe pain from his knee and back,
and  prescription  painkillers were  not  working for  him.  He  used marijuana  between  two
and four times during that period. The marijuana did nothing for his pain, so he stopped
using it. (Government Exhibits 1 at Section 23, and 2; Applicant Exhibit K; Tr. 24-25, 52-
58.)
2.c.  Applicant  began  having  seizures  in  2015.  He  did  research  that  indicated
ingesting  marijuana  or  pills  that  contained  tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC),  the  active
ingredient in marijuana, would possibly help stop the seizures. At that time he consumed
several THC pills that were prescribed for someone else. The pills were unsuccessful in
stopping his seizures, so he stopped using them. (Government Exhibits 1 at Section 23,
and 2; Applicant Exhibit K; Tr. 25, 58-62.)
Applicant had not used illegal drugs since 2015 and has no intention of using illegal
drugs in the future. As of the date of the hearing he was not taking any pain medication,
or other medication. (Tr. 60-63.)
