Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He is 38 years old. He has never
been married and he does not have any children.1
Applicant graduated from high school in 1998. He attended college from 1998 to
2004, but he did not earn a degree. He has worked for his current employer, a defense
contractor,  since  May  2017.  Since  he  started  working  for  his  current  employer,  he
received  two  raises  and  was  recently  promoted.  He  has  worked  for  various  defense
contractors and held a security clearance since 2008.2
Applicant  lied  about  having  a  bachelor’s  degree  during  a  November  2008
background  interview,  on  his  August  2010  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  and
during a December 2016 background interview. He also lied about having a bachelor’s
degree during the hiring process with a prospective employer in late 2011. Though this
employer fired him in early 2012 after learning that he did not have such a degree, he
lied  on  his  December  2015  SCA  and  during  the  2016  background  interview  when  he
stated that he left this job in 2012 because he received a new employment offer (SOR
¶¶ 1.a - 1.f). He admitted that he initially lied about having a bachelor’s degree, and the
true reason for his 2012 firing, only after he was confronted during the 2016 interview.3
Applicant  struggled  academically  in  college.  He  was  suspended  for  several
semesters  because  his  grade  point  average  fell  below  a  2.0.  He  walked  away  from
college in 2004. He testified that lying about graduating from college is one of his life’s
biggest regrets. He testified that he is ashamed that he never graduated, as he comes
from  a  family  who  have  earned  professional  degrees.  He  testified  that  he  was  in  his
early 20s when he first told the lie, and he did not truly understand the ramifications. He
testified that when he applied for a job, “the lie just became my story . . . it’s catching up
to  me  now  .  .  .  with  my  security  clearance.”  He  expressed  remorse  for  his  deception,
stating “that’s not who I am, and it’s something that I’m . . . very, very ashamed about.”4
1 Response to the SOR; Tr. at 7, 24-25, 91-92; GE 1-3.
2 Tr. at 7-8, 25, 42-52, 78, 83-88; GE 1-3.
3 Response to the SOR; Tr. at 22-110; GE 1-5. Applicant acknowledged that he likely lied about having a
bachelor’s degree to two other employers in around 2005 and 2007. Tr. at 29-32, 34-36.
4 Tr. at 22-110.
Applicant  testified  that  after  his  2012  employment  termination,  he  revised  his
resume  to  reflect  only  that  he  attended  college  from  1998  to  2004  in  pursuit  of  a
bachelor’s degree. He testified that he gave his revised resume to his prior employer as
well as to his current employer. He testified that his current employer is aware that his
highest level of education is a high-school diploma. He provided a copy of his resume,
which reflects under the heading titled “Education,” the name of the college he attended
and his area of study. He also provided copies of two emails, dated March 8, 2012 and
April 2, 2013, purporting to corroborate his testimony that he gave his revised resume to
his  prior  employer  from  2014  to  2017.  As  both  the  emails  reflect  that  he  is  both  the
sender and the receiver, I do not give these documents any weight.5
As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  Applicant’s  mother,  siblings,  and  girlfriend  were
unaware  that  he  did  not  have  a  bachelor’s  degree,  and  that  he  falsified  information
about  having  one.  Though  he  testified  that  he  would  not  be  concerned  if  they  were  to
find  out,  he  has  not  yet  told  them  because  he  is  still  ashamed.  He  does  not  want  to
disappoint his mother.6
