In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments some of the factual
allegations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.b., 1.e., 1.f., and 1.h.). She denied with comments the
remaining  allegations,  and  she  claimed  that  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  and  1.g.  were  identical.
Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration
of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is 33 years old. It is unclear what her current employment status is for
the records indicate that she is a teacher-assistant with a local county school system (as
of October 2016) during the day; and an unspecified type of employee of a local health
center  (as  of  September  2016)  during  the  evenings;  or  an  employee  or  employee-
candidate  (at  least  since  April  2018)  with  an  unspecified  position  in  a  local  military
hospital.  It  is  unclear  when  she  graduated  from  high  school,  for  she  indicated  to  an
investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in April 2017 that she
had  graduated  more  than  ten  years  earlier.  She  received  a  certification  in  massage
therapy in October 2005. Applicant has never served with the U.S. military. She has never
held  a  security  clearance,  and  it  is  unclear  if  she  ever  held  a  position  of  public  trust.
Applicant has never married, but she has been cohabitating since September 2007.  She
has five children, born in 2003 (residing with the child’s father), 2009, 2010, 2013, and
2015.
Financial Considerations1
It is unclear when Applicant’s financial difficulties first arose.  Applicant attributed
her financial problems to several different factors: 1) according to her e-QIP entries, in
March 2013, because she was disappointed with her job, expecting a baby, and having
migraine  headaches, she decided to  quit  the  job  she  had  held  since  March 2006,  and
“take  care  of  [her]  health  and  stay  at  home  with  [her]  children;”  2)  she  remained
unemployed until February 2014, as a “stay at home mom;” 3) she was again unemployed
from June 2014 until September 2014; 4) she loaned her brother’s significant-other an
unspecified amount to catch up on their bills, but the money was never paid back; 5) her
fiancé and she made poor job decisions that did not work out; 6) her son’s father refused
to furnish her with insurance information to resolve a medical bill; 7) when she was unable
to pay her property taxes in 2015, her tax refund was applied to the debt; and 8) she had
poor money management and financial decision-making.2
During  her  OPM  interview,  she  added:  9)  her  fiancé  was  trying  to  run  a  self-
employed business as a wedding disc jockey, but the business failed and they were left
in  a  difficult  financial  situation.3  In  her  Answer  to  the  SOR,  she  added:  10)  she  had
insufficient funds to keep her mortgage payments current; 11) she was unaware that her
fiancé was intercepting the mail associated with their home mortgage; and 12) she was
unaware that her fiancé was not making the monthly payments on the car loan for which
she  had  cosigned.4  Applicant’s  credit  reports  included  additional  information.  In  2012
there was a judgment filed against her for $316, which was paid in April 2013; and the
mortgage on her house was chronically late, between 30 and 120 days past due, as early
as 2010.5
The SOR identified eight purportedly continuing delinquent debts totaling $14,287
that had been placed for collection, charged off, or gone to foreclosure (not including the
unspecified  unpaid  mortgage  balance  on  a  home  mortgage  that  was  foreclosed),  as
reflected  by  the  September  2016  credit  report  or  the  April  2017  credit  report.  While
Applicant  contended  that  several  of  the  accounts  were  on  repayment  plans  and  were
being  paid,  or  were  already  paid  off,  with  some  exceptions,  she  failed  to  submit
meaningful documentation from her creditors, such as copies of those plans or receipts,
to support her own handwritten notes that certain agreements had been reached. As for
the other accounts, she claimed that she would make either continuing payments or start

Internal Revenue Service (IRS).6
Applicant’s delinquent accounts are as follows: a telephone account with an unpaid
balance  of  $231  that  was  eventually  settled  for  less  than  the  full  balance  with  two
payments of $67 in April 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.a.);7 an individual home mortgage, originally in
the  amount  of  $115,995,  that  was  foreclosed  in  May  2015  when  the  credit  grantor
reclaimed  collateral  to  settle  the  mortgage  (SOR  ¶  1.b.);8  a  joint  automobile  loan  for
$13,987, of which $10,601 was charged off, and Applicant has made no effort to resolve
(SOR  ¶  1.c.);9  a  satellite  television  account  with  an  unpaid  balance  of  $778  that  was
purportedly settled for $428, and a payment of that amount in April 2017, but for which
there is no documentation to support Applicant’s contention that there was a settlement
(SOR ¶ 1.d.);10 and an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance of $1,089 for
which  Applicant  purportedly  entered  into  a  payment  arrangement  calling  for  a  $282
payment in February 2018, and Applicant’s promise to pay the remainder upon receipt of
her income tax refund in late February 2018, but for which there is no documentation to
support  the  existence  of  a  repayment  arrangement  or  subsequent  payments  (SOR  ¶
1.e.).11
In addition, there are a medical account with an unpaid balance of $728 for which
Applicant  purportedly  entered  into  a  payment  arrangement  calling  for a $5 payment  in
January  2018,  and  Applicant’s  promise  to  either  continuing  paying  that  amount  each
month or pay the remainder upon receipt of her income tax refund in late February 2018,
but  for  which  there  is  no  documentation  to  support  the  existence  of  a  repayment
arrangement or subsequent payments (SOR ¶ 1.f.);12 a cable television account with an

in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR

unpaid balance of $318 that Applicant claims is identical to her telephone account, for
which there is no documentation to support her claim that the two different creditors are
the same company, and there is no evidence to indicate that any contacts with the creditor
have been made or any payments to the creditor have been made (SOR ¶ 1.g.);13 and an
unspecified  type  of  account  with  an  unpaid  balance  of  $542  for  which  Applicant
purportedly  entered  into  a  settlement  arrangement  calling  for  a  $326  payment  upon
receipt of her income tax refund in February 2018, but for which there is no documentation
to support the existence of a settlement arrangement or any payments (SOR ¶ 1.h.).14
There is no evidence that Applicant has ever received financial counseling. There
is  no  evidence  of  a  budget.  Applicant  did  not  explain  what  corrective  actions  she  has
taken over an extensive period to avoid the pitfalls or other factors that she identified as
the ones that caused her financial difficulties. She offered no explanation for her failure
to  make  attempts  to  resolve  her  accounts  before  she  was  interviewed  by  the  OPM
investigator on February 12, 2017 – the same day she made her initial modest payments
to her creditors. Furthermore, there is no Personal Financial Statement to reflect her net
monthly income, monthly expenses, or any remainder available for discretionary use or
savings. There is no evidence to indicate that Applicant’s financial situation is now under
control.
