Applicant  admitted  to  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.,  1.b.,  1.d.,  and  1.e.  She
denied  SOR  allegation  ¶  1.c.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,
exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  65-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  page  5.)
She has been employed with the defense contractor since August of 2015, and she has
held  a  security  clearance,  with  extended  periods  of  unemployment  and  under
employment,  since  about  October  of  1989.  (GX  1  at  pages  10~17  and  29.)  She
attributes her admitted financial difficulties to her periods of unemployment, and to her
focus on caring for her father and grandmother. (TR at page 22 line 8 to page 26 line
21.) Her father suffered from dementia, and her grandmother “lived to be 106 years old.”

Guideline F – Financial Considerations
1.a.  and  1.b.  Applicant  admits  that  she  filed  both  her  Federal and  state  income
tax returns in an untimely fashion from 2000~2015. (TR at page 39 line 5 to page 40 line
20, see also TR at page 26 line 22 to page 32 line 13.) She attributes her late filings to
her family pressures. (Id.) Applicant filed her 2016 tax returns in a timely fashion. (TR at
page 39 line 5 to page 40 line 20.)
1.c.~1.e.  Applicant  admits,  in  part,  and  denies,  in  part,  that  she  owes  back
federal income taxes for tax years 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016, totaling about $10,320.
(TR at page 40 line 21 to page 42 line 5; see also TR at page 32 line 14 to page 37 line
19.) Pursuant to an “Installment Agreement,” she is making monthly payments of about
$160  to  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS),  as  evidenced  by  documentation  from  the
IRS. (AppX J.)
Applicant  lives  within  her  financial  means,  as  evidenced  by  a  monthly  budget
showing a monthly surplus of about $689, including her IRS payments. (AppX L.) She is
also  well  respected  at  work  and  in  her  community  as  evidenced  by  eight  letters  of
support.  (AppX  K.) These  letters include  those from a  lawyer,  from a  law  enforcement
officer, and from a Public Safety Commissioner.  (Id.)
