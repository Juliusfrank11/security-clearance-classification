Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b and denied SOR ¶ 1.c.
She  is  47  years  old.  She  married  in  1997  and  divorced  in  2014.  She  has  two  adult
children.1
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  1989.  She  then  enlisted  in  the  U.S.
military  and  honorably  retired  in  2009.  She  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2016.  She
has worked for various defense contractors since 2009. She has worked for her current
employer,  a  defense  contractor,  since  approximately  2015.  She  was  first  granted  a
security clearance in approximately 1991.2
Applicant  started  consuming  alcohol  at  age  18,  after  she  enlisted  in  the  U.S.
military. She acknowledged that she drank to excess, at times, from age 18 to 24. She
binge drank approximately eight to nine beers twice weekly on the weekends. From age
24 to 39, she drank three to four beers or shared a bottle of wine with her then-husband
once weekly.3
In  December  2011,  Applicant  was  charged  and  convicted  of  driving  while
intoxicated  (DWI)  1st  offense  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  This  was  her  first  alcohol-related  offense.
She went to a friend’s retirement party and had two glasses of wine. She learned later
that because the wine she consumed was  homemade, it had a higher alcohol content
than store-bought wine. She did not feel impaired. On her way home, she picked up a
friend  at  a  nearby  bar  who  asked  her  for  a  ride.  She  was  pulled  over  as  she  was
dropping her friend off at his home. When the police asked her if she had been drinking,
she replied “Yes.” She was administered a breathalyzer and her blood alcohol content
(BAC) was .10%. She was sentenced to 60 days suspended, driver’s license restriction

for six months, ordered to complete a 20-hour safe driving course, and fined $450. She
complied with the court’s sentence.4
In October 2013, Applicant was charged and convicted of DWI 2nd offense (SOR
¶  1.b).  This  was  her  second  alcohol-related  offense  and  the  last  time  she  drove  after
drinking.  After  work  that  day,  she  went  directly  to  class.  She  and  several  classmates
grabbed drinks at a bar across the street after class. She had three beers. She last ate
at  noon.  She  was  tired  but  she  did  not  feel  impaired.  She  was  pulled  over  about  one
mile  from  home.  The  police  officer  told  her  that  she  was  driving  erratically,  and  she
replied  “Yes”  when  asked  if  she  had  been  drinking.  She  was  administered  a
breathalyzer and her BAC was .11%.5
Applicant  was  sentenced  to  180  days  with  150  suspended;  probation  for  three
years;  suspended  driver’s  license  for  four  months,  then  driver’s  license  restriction  for
three  years  with  an  interlock  device  installed  on  her  car  for  six  months;  ordered  to
attend  alcohol  counseling  and  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA),  and  abstain  from  alcohol;
and fined $700. She complied with the court’s sentence. She served 15 days in jail; she
successfully  completed  probation;  she  did  not  consume  any  alcohol  during  her  three-
year probation period; and she attended counseling once monthly and two AA meetings
weekly  for  36  weeks.  She  did  not  receive  an  alcohol  diagnosis,  but  learned  through
counseling  how  to  handle  her  tendency  to  make  decisions  impulsively  and  how  to
exercise mindfulness.6
In March 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with probation violation, due
to  an  alcohol  reading  registering  on  the  interlock  device  installed  on  her  car  (SOR  ¶
1.c). She denied that she consumed alcohol in violation of her probation. She testified
that  she  appeared  in  court  to  fight  the  charge,  was  found  not  guilty,  and  the  court
ordered the removal of the interlock device, which was done in July 2015. She believed
that a court record reflecting that she was found guilty of the violation was an error. The
same record reflected that she did not receive a sentence from the court in connection
with  this  offense.  She  provided  a  copy  of  another  court  record  reflecting  that  she  was
found not guilty for the same offense, and the court ordered the removal of the interlock
device in June 2015.7
Applicant testified that she resumed consuming alcohol in November 2016, when
she  had  a  glass  of  wine  with  Thanksgiving  dinner.  She  consumes  one  drink  once
monthly, and testified that she does not have a compulsion to drink more. She has no
future  intentions  of  driving  after  drinking.  On  the  occasions  where  she  knows  she  will
have  a  drink  and  have  to  get  home,  she  plans  ahead  and  arranges  for  alternate
transportation.  She  attributed  her  heavy  drinking  in  2011  and  2013  to  adjusting  to  life

after  military  retirement,  her  2010  separation,  and  her  subsequent  divorce,  while
simultaneously working and attending school. She testified, though, that she never felt
she  abused  alcohol,  and  her  alcohol  use  did  not  negatively  factor  into  her  previous
marriage.  She  testified  that  other  than  a  2013  speeding  ticket,  her  driving  record  is
clean.8
Applicant indicated that her two DUIs are common knowledge. She testified that
she told her witness and her character reference about her DUIs. Her witness was her
team supervisor since 2015. He testified that he was aware that Applicant had at least
one  DUI.  He  had  never  witnessed  Applicant  report  to  work  under  the  influence  of
alcohol.  He  had  occasions  to  observe  her  consume  alcohol  and  did  not  witness  her
consume irresponsibly. He also relied on her to serve as a designated driver for a fellow
team member several times between 2015 and 2018. He described Applicant as one of
his best analysts on a team of 23, and an exceptional worker. Her character reference
was  her  direct  supervisor  since  March  2017.  He  wrote  that  he  was  “extremely
impressed by [Applicant’s] work ethic and reliability,” and described her as a trustworthy
individual.9
