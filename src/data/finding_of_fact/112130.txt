Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for
her current employer since September 2018. She seeks to retain a security clearance,
which  she  has  held  since  about  2008.  She  is  a  high  school  graduate.  She  married  in
2016. She has two adult children and a child less than a year old. (Tr. at 17, 24-26, 29;
GE 1)
Except for about a six-month period in 2013, Applicant was unemployed between
September  2012  and January  2015. She  was  raising  her teenage  children  without  the
benefit of child support, and she was taking care of an ill sister. Her sister passed away
in  2015.  Applicant  and  her  mother  paid  for  the  funeral  and  burial  expenses.  Applicant
and  her  mother  own  a  home  together  and  share  the  mortgage  payments.  Her  mother
works ten  months  a  year at  a  school. They  spilt  the mortgage  payments for those  ten
months, and Applicant pays the full mortgage payments for the remaining two months.
Applicant felt that she had to keep a roof over her children’s head and she concentrated
on the mortgage loan while her car was repossessed and other debts went unpaid. (Tr.

The  SOR  alleges  a  charged-off  deficiency  balance  of  $16,323  owed  on  a  car
loan  after  the  car  was  repossessed;  a  student  loan  that  was  $765  past  due;  five
delinquent  medical  debts  totaling  $1,307;  and  three  miscellaneous  delinquent  debts
totaling  $1,614.  Except  as  addressed  below,  the  allegations  are  established  through
credit reports and Applicant’s admissions.
Applicant  has  made  periodic  payments  toward  the  deficiency  owed  on  the  car
loan (SOR ¶ 1.a). She made payment arrangements with the creditor in August 2017 to
pay $50 per month. The balance then was $16,323. She made four $50 payments from
August 2017 through November 2017; four $50 payments from February 2018 through
May  2018;  a  $25  payment  in  April  2019;  and  $50  payments  in  May  2019  and  June
2019.  The  payments  total  $525.  The  balance  in  June  2019  was  $15,798.  Applicant
stated that the creditor is willing to accept a  $3,000 lump-sum settlement, but she has
been unable to afford to pay the amount requested. (Tr. at 19, 39-44; GE 2-4; AE A, F,
I, Q)
In  July  2017, Applicant  was  $765  past  due on  a  student  loan  with  a  balance  of
$6,165 (SOR ¶ 1.b). The loan was transferred to a student loan servicing company. The
April 2019 credit report shows that Applicant was current on her payments toward two
student loans serviced by the company. The company approved Applicant’s request for
forbearance  on  the  loans.  The  approval  notice  “confirms  that  [she  is]  willing  but
temporarily unable to make payments due to financial hardship.” Interest will continue to
accrue, but Applicant is not required to resume payments until March 2020. (Tr. at 44-
48; GE 2-4; AE I, N)
Applicant opened a credit card account in May 2016. The July 2017 credit report
shows  the date of  last  action  was  September 2016. It  shows  a  charged-off balance of
$1,111 (SOR ¶ 1.c). She established that she made seven monthly $25 payments from
November  2017  through  April  2018;  a  $10  payment  in  May  2018;  five  $25  payments
from June 2018 through October 2018; and three payments totaling $76 from April 2019
through  June  2019.  The  payments  total  $386.  The  April  2019  credit  report  lists  the
balance of the debt as $826, but that was before the most recent payments of $76 (Tr.
at 20-21, 49-50; GE 2-4; AE I, L, P)
The  February  2015  credit  report  lists  a  past-due  telecommunications  debt  in
collections  with  a  balance  of  $427.  The  July  2017  credit  report  lists  the  debt  with  a
balance of $49, which is the amount alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e. That indicates that Applicant
paid $378 to the creditor between February 2015 and July 2017.  Applicant paid $31 in
March 2017 to pay the final amount owed on the debt. (Tr. at 19, 57; GE 2-4; AE D)
The  February  2015  credit  report  lists  a  department  store  credit  card  opened  in
August  2007,  with  a  date  of  last  action  of  November  2008.  It  shows  a  charged-off
balance of $454 (SOR ¶ 1.h). The account had been delinquent for almost nine years
when the SOR was issued in July 2017. Applicant stated that she believed the account
was  paid.  It  was  not  listed  on  credit  reports  from  July  2017  and  April  2019,  likely
because it was past the seven-year reporting window. Applicant contacted the creditor
and was told the creditor showed the account with a zero balance. (Tr. at 58-60; GE 2-
4; AE I)
The SOR alleged five medical debts totaling $1,307.  The debts are all listed on
the  July  2017  credit  report.  From  August  2017  through  May  2018,  Applicant  made
payments totaling $367 to the company collecting the $558 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f.
The  $298  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.d  is  the  only  medical  debt  listed  on  the  July  2017
credit report. Applicant stated that she believes the medical debts are paid. None of the
medical debts are listed on the April 2019 credit report. (Tr. at 19, 51-58; GE 2-4; AE O)
Applicant married in 2016. She pays the debts that she bought into the marriage;
her  husband  pays  the  ones  that  he  had;  and  they  share  responsibility  for  paying  their
current bills. She stopped paying her older debts when she was on maternity leave from
October 2018 through January 2019. She resumed her payments in April 2019. She has
not  received  formal financial  counseling,  but  she  stated  that  her  finances  are  in  better
shape.  Her  husband  is  employed.  They  are  able  to  pay  their  current  bills  while
continuing to work on paying her older debts. In addition to her mortgage payments, she
is paying  $624 per month  on  a  $28,625  car  loan  she  took  out  in  June  2017.  She  also
cosigned  the  $13,830  car  loan  for  her  husband’s  car.  He  pays  that  loan.  The  debt
alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  is  the  only  delinquent  account  listed  on  her  April  2019  credit
report.  She  credibly  stated  that  she  is  committed  to  maintaining  her  finances  in  order
and paying her debts. (Tr. at 24, 30-38, 44, 48-49, 60; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE
2-4; AE I)
