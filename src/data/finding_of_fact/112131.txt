In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all of the factual
allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.n.),
and  the  factual  allegation  pertaining  to  personal  conduct  in  the  SOR  (SOR  ¶  2.a.).
Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration
of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving
as  a  provisioning  specialist  with  her  current  employer  in  three  different  geographical
locations since April 2005. A 1987 high school graduate, Applicant attended a community
college for three months in 2002, but she did not earn a degree. She enlisted in the U.S.
Air Force in June 1987, and served on active duty until February 1996, when she was
honorably  discharged.  She  was  first  granted  a  secret  clearance  in  1987,  and  it  was
renewed in 2005. Applicant has never been married. She has two children, born in 1993
and 1995.
Financial Considerations1
It is unclear when Applicant first started having financial difficulties, although in her
2005  e-QIP  she  identified  some  accounts  that  had  been  delinquent  since  2001.  Her
December  2005  credit  report  also  lists  a  number  of  delinquent  accounts  that  became
delinquent  in  2001.  Applicant  identified  only  three  factors  that  she  attributed  to  her
financial  difficulties:  she  is  the  single  mother  of  two  children;  she  was  unemployed  for
nearly  a  full  year  in  2001;  and  she  has  exhibited  poor  management  and  made  poor
financial decisions (including supporting a family that resided with her).2 The record refers
to one period of unemployment, starting in May 2001, and lasting until October 2001, as
well as one period of under-employment with the state department of social and health
services, providing day-care services, starting in October 2001, and lasting until August
2002. Applicant claimed to have either set up payment plans or intended to do so with
several creditors or collection agents; claimed to be making monthly payments on some
accounts; and intended to have all of her delinquent debts resolved by the end of 2006.3
In  her  December  2015  e-QIP,  Applicant  acknowledged  only  one  continuing
financial issue, identified as unpaid federal income tax for the tax year 2010, but indicated
that  she  was  working  with  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  on  a  payment  plan.4
Applicant apparently had insufficient funds to cover all of her monthly bills, and accounts
became  delinquent.  Some  accounts  were  charged  off,  and  two  judgments  were  filed
against  her.  Applicant’s  wages  were  garnished  in  2011,  but  it  is  unclear  as  to  which
creditor the garnishment  was associated. Applicant also failed to timely file her federal
income tax returns over a multi-year period, essentially claiming that she did so because
she knew she owed tax because of insufficient withholding and insufficient funds to pay
her  2010  taxes,5  and  she  now  owes  a  substantial  sum  of  unpaid  taxes  to  the  IRS.

5  The  legal  requirement  to  file  a  federal  income  tax  return  is  based  upon  an  individual’s  gross
income and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined that there is an obligation to so file, the
following applies:
Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title
or  by  regulations  made  under  authority  thereof  to  make  a  return,  keep  any  records,  or
supply  any  information,  who  willfully  fails  to  pay  such  estimated  tax  or  tax,  make  such
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law
or  regulations,  shall,  in  addition  to  other  penalties  provided  by  law,  be  guilty  of  a
Applicant did not discuss the reasons for her subsequent failures to timely file her federal
income  tax  returns  for  the  tax  years  2011  through  2015.  There  is  no  evidence  that
Applicant ever received financial counseling.
In  addition  to  unfiled  federal  income  tax  returns  covering  the  tax  years  2010
through 2015; $43,237 in unpaid taxes owed to the IRS; and a garnishment of $3,989 in
wages, the SOR identified seven delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection,
charged off, or reduced to judgments as generally reflected by Applicant’s five different
credit  reports.  Those  seven  debts,  total  approximately  $2,690.  There  are  also
approximately one dozen delinquent debts that were not alleged in the SOR.6  Although
Applicant has repeatedly promised that she would address her delinquent debts within
certain stated time frames, she has offered little documentation to indicate that: she has
contacted  her  creditors  or  collection  agents  to  negotiate  payment  plans;  established
payment plans; made payments in an effort to resolve any delinquent debts; or actually
paid  off  any  of  her  debts.  The  sole  exceptions  were  her  entering  into  two  installment
agreements in 2013 and 2016 with the IRS with respect to her federal income taxes for
the tax year 2010, and the cancellation of those agreements associated with Applicant’s
failures to remain in compliance with them, and her request to the IRS for tax transcripts
covering the tax years 2010 through 2015, on November 7, 2017.7
Among the federal income tax returns that Applicant failed to timely file were: the
income tax return for the tax year 2010, which was eventually filed in February 2012, for
which there was an unpaid balance of approximately $6,745, and only one payment was
made for $100 in June 2012 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.f.);8 the income tax return for the tax year
misdemeanor  and,  upon  conviction  thereof,  shall  be  fined  not  more  than  $25,000
($100,000  in  the  case  of  a  corporation),  or  imprisoned  not  more  than  1  year,  or  both,
together  with  the  costs  of  prosecution.  In  the  case  of  any  person  with  respect  to  whom
there is a failure to pay any estimated tax, this section shall not apply to such person with
respect to such failure if there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect
to such failure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the first
sentence of this section shall be applied by substituting "felony" for "misdemeanor" and "5
years" for "1 year."
26 U.S.C. § 7203, Willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax.
6 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal
Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to
evaluate  an  applicant's  evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to  consider
whether  an  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful  rehabilitation;  (d)  to  decide  whether  a  particular
provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis
under Directive § 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No.
02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also
ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd.
Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant’s unlisted and unalleged
delinquent accounts will be considered only for the five purposes listed above.

2011,  which  was  eventually  filed  in  December  2015,  for  which  there  was  an  unpaid
balance of approximately $5,471, and only one payment was made for $10 in April 2012
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b. and 1.f.);9  the income tax return for the tax year 2012, for which there was
an unpaid balance of approximately $9,058, and no evidence that the income tax return
has yet been filed (SOR ¶¶ 1.c. and 1.f.);10 the income tax return for the tax year 2013,
which was eventually filed in December 2015, for which there was an unpaid balance of
approximately $7,641, and only one payment was made for $1 in April 2014 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d.
and  1.f.);11  the  income  tax  return  for  the  tax  year  2014,  which  was  eventually  filed  in
December 2015, for which there was an unpaid balance of approximately $14,323, and
no evidence of any payments made (SOR ¶¶ 1.e. and 1.f.);12 and the income tax return
for the tax year 2015, which was eventually filed in September 2018, for which there was
an  unpaid  balance  of  approximately  $3,520,  and  no  evidence  of  any  payments  made
(SOR  ¶  1.f.).13  Other  than  three  miniscule  payments  totaling  $111  over  the  multi-year
period,  there  is  no  evidence  that  other  agreements  have  been  made  or  that  other
payments, other than through garnishment, have been made by Applicant. While most of
the federal income tax returns were eventually filed, Applicant still owes a substantial sum
to the IRS. These accounts have not been resolved, and there is little evidence that they
will soon be in the process of being resolved.
In addition to the unpaid federal income taxes, the SOR listed seven delinquent
accounts.  Those  debts,  none  of  which  have  been  addressed  or  resolved  by  Applicant
since her December 2016 interview with an investigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel
Management (OPM), or since her SOR was issued in September 2018, are described as
follows: a charge account with an unpaid balance of $904 that was charged off (SOR ¶
1.g.); an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance of $436 that was purchased
from  the  original  creditor  (SOR  ¶  1.h.);  a  cable  television  or  Internet  account  with  an
unpaid balance of $305 (SOR ¶ 1.i.); a cellular telephone account with an unpaid balance
of $239 (SOR ¶ 1.j.); a medical account with an unpaid balance of $74 (SOR ¶ 1.k.); an
unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance that was reduced to a judgment for
$149 (SOR ¶ 1.l.); and an apartment lease with an unpaid balance that was reduced to a
judgment for $583 in 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.m.).
It is not known what Applicant’s current financial resources may be because she
did  not  report  her  current  net  monthly  income;  monthly  expenses;  and  any  monthly
remainder  that  might  be  available  for  discretionary  spending  or  savings.  There  is  no
evidence of a budget. Although Applicant noted that her children are now grown, and they
no longer rely on her as much, and that she is currently in a better position to be able to

start resolving all of her current indebtedness,14 she offered no evidence to indicate that
her financial situation is now under control.
Personal Conduct
In  2011,  although  there  were  continuing  financial  issues  from  2005,  Applicant
lacked  candor, and  in her 2011  e-QIP,  she denied  any  such  issues.  Her failure  in  this
regard is unalleged conduct, as it was not alleged in the SOR.
On December 2, 2015, when Applicant completed her e-QIP, she responded to
certain questions pertaining to her financial record found in Section 26. Some of those
questions asked if, in the past seven years, she had defaulted on any type of loan; had
bills  or  debts  turned  over  to  a  collection  agency;  had  any  account  or  credit  card
suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed; and been over 120 days
delinquent on any debt not previously entered; as well as if she is currently over 120 days
delinquent on any debt? Applicant answered “no” to all of those questions, and certified
that her responses were “true, complete, and correct” to the best of her knowledge and
belief.15  In  fact,  her  answers  were  incorrect,  for  Applicant  actually  had  delinquent
accounts that clearly came within the scope of the questions asked.
There was one other question in Section 26 that could have been cited in the SOR,
but for some reason it was not specifically cited: In the past seven years did she have a
judgment  entered  against  her?  Applicant  also  answered  “no”  to  that  question.16  In  her
Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  that  she  had  deliberately  falsified  the  material
facts in her responses to the e-QIP inquiries, although she modified that admission by
claiming she misunderstood the question and was answering it based on her credit report
at the time. Nevertheless, even though she claimed to now understand the question, she
admitted that she did falsify material facts.17
