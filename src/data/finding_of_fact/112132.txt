Applicant is 51 years old and works for a defense contractor. He married in 2004,
and he separated from his wife in January 2016. He and his wife have no children, though
his wife has an adult son from a prior relationship. Applicant has no financial responsibility
to his wife following their separation in January 2016. (GE 2 at 20; Tr. at 39-41, 44.)
Applicant graduated from high school in 1985, and in May 2007, he received his
bachelor’s degree. He has worked full time for a defense contractor since January 2007.
From  2003  to  2017,  Applicant  had  a  second,  part-time  job  with  a  different  defense
contractor. In or about May 2009, he began working for his current employer and security
clearance sponsor. He received his first security clearance in June 2004. His clearance
was renewed in 2010 or 2011. He submitted a security clearance application on January
20, 2016, (SCA) seeking the renewal of his top secret clearance. (GE 1; GE 2 at 20, 24;
Tr. 39, 44, and 48.)
The  SOR  contains  nine  allegations  under  Guideline  F,  eight  of  which  involve
Applicant’s  failure  to  pay  federal and  state  taxes  in  2014  and  2015  and  state  taxes  in
2013, as well as his failure to file federal tax returns in 2013, 2014, and 2015. Applicant’s
total federal and state tax debts are alleged to be about $32,000 for these years. He is
also  alleged  to  owe  $1,339  on  a  judgment  obtained  by  the  homeowners’  association
(HOA)  where  he  lived  with  his  wife  from  2002  to  2016.  In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant
admitted all of the allegations except the HOA judgment. He also claimed that he owes
significantly less in taxes  than was alleged in the SOR and that he has filed amended
returns to support that position.
1 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application, dated January 20,
2016 (GE 1), unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
In  August  2016,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  under  the
influence (DUI) and other related charges. He failed to report the arrest to his part-time
employer at the time, as required by the employer’s rules. This was a major rules violation,
and  his  employer  terminated  him  on  January  20,  2017.  Under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR
alleges  Applicant’s  2016  DUI  arrest  and his subsequent  termination from  his part-time
employment. Applicant admitted both allegations in his SOR answer. (GE 4 at 2; GE 2 at
23.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e: failure to pay federal income taxes in 2014
and 2015 in the approximate amount of $27,913 and failure to file federal income
tax returns, as required, in 2013, 2014, and 2015. In his January 2016 SCA, Applicant
disclosed that he failed to file his 2014 federal tax return because he owed taxes for that
year. He wrote that he was saving money every month so he could satisfy this obligation
in 2015. His SCA, however, was signed on January 20, 2016.  He testified that he had
originally prepared the SCA in 2015, and due to a technical problem, he had to resubmit
the SCA in 2016. (Tr. at 27.)
In response to the DOD CAF’S April 2017 interrogatories, Applicant provided his
Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  tax  account  transcripts  for  the  years  2013,  2014,  and
2015, which were dated June 5, 2017. The 2013 transcript shows that Applicant failed to
file a tax return for that year. The 2014 transcript shows that the return was filed late on
April 24, 2017, and that Applicant owed about $15,500. The 2015 transcript shows that
the return was filed late on May 29, 2017, and that Applicant owed approximately $20,490.
(GE 2 at 8-10.)
In his January 2017 background interview, Applicant explained that prior to 2014,
he and his wife filed jointly, but in 2015, she advised him that she wanted to file separately.
He  said  that  because  of  this  change,  he  failed  to  file  his  2014  and  2015  tax  returns.
Applicant advised the investigator that he believed he owed taxes. He said that he had
not yet done anything about his taxes, but he intended to work with a friend, who is a tax
accountant, to file his returns. He also said he intended to make payment arrangements
with the IRS. (GE 2 at 24.)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  later  in  2017,  he  consulted  his  tax
accountant friend and the accountant filed amended returns for those two years and filed
the missing 2013 return. He explained that prior to 2013, he and his wife had previously
worked together with a large tax preparation company to prepare and file their tax returns.
Starting in 2013, his mother and sister became seriously ill and he was busy taking care
of them. He also blamed his tax delinquencies on his marital problems with his wife. He
failed to work with his tax preparer that year. He did not contact a tax accountant until
2017. During the three years in question, which was before his January 2016 separation
from his wife, he also stopped taking any deductions on his family home. Instead he let
his wife take these deductions on her separate returns. Applicant claimed that his failure
to file for three years was not due to the fact that he knew he owed money and was not
in a position to pay the taxes at the time.(Tr. at 67-73; 78, 83, 90, and 106.)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  introduced  into  evidence  updated  IRS  tax  account
transcripts, dated August 15, 2018. These transcripts show that Applicant filed his 2013
tax return on September 11, 2017, and owed $8,572. The reason he owed more taxes
was due to his change in his tax filing status and his failure to adjust his withholding after
receiving  an  increase  in  his  income.  He  testified  that  he  has  never  changed  his
withholding. The updated 2014 transcript reflects that Applicant filed an amended return
on November 7, 2017, and that he had no balance due as a result of credits for his refunds
from 2016 and 2017 and certain other adjustments. Similarly, the updated 2015 transcript
reflects  that  Applicant  filed  an  amended  return  on  November  20,  2017,  and  that  after
certain adjustments and a small credit from his 2017 refund, Applicant only owed $5,008.
(Tr. at 73-84; AE A, B, and C.) Accordingly, Applicant’s total tax debt for 2013 and 2015
is  approximately  $13,580,  as  of  August  15,  2018,  based  upon  Applicant’s  amended
returns.
Applicant admitted at the hearing that the IRS had not fully accepted the numbers
in  the  amended  returns,  and  therefore,  the  Service  has  not  given  him  a  final  number
representing  his  total  tax  liability  for  the  2013-2015  period.  As  a  result,  he  has  not
commenced paying his federal tax debt on a payment plan. He blamed the 2017 amended
returns for the delay. Applicant has not received any financial counseling in connection
with his tax indebtedness or more generally since 2013. (Tr. at 86, 95-96, and 109.) His
federal tax debt is not resolved, though he ultimately filed his tax returns for 2013-2015 in
2017.
SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h: failure to pay state income taxes in 2013, 2014, and
2015 in the total amount of $4,088. As noted, Applicant disclosed in his SCA his failure
to  file  his  state  tax  return  for  2014.  The  Government’s  evidence  includes  state  tax
computation  notices,  dated  May,  June,  and  July  2017,  for  the  years  2014,  2015,  and
2013, respectively. Applicant testified that these dates in 2017 are the dates he filed his
state tax returns. Applicant provided these documents in response to the Government’s
interrogatories. They reflect Applicant owes state taxes for 2013 in the amount of $1,889.
For 2014, the record evidence shows that he owes $861, and for 2015, he owes $1,900.
As of mid-2017, Applicant’s total state tax debt was approximately $4,650. (Tr. at 84-94.)
At the hearing, Applicant introduced into evidence a state installment tax bill, dated
July 30, 2018, which reflected that his remaining balance was about $220 and that he
owed an installment of about $94 on August 15, 2018. He testified that he commenced
paying  on  his  installment  payment  plan  in  approximately  January  2018  and  presently
owes  about  $126.  (AE  D;  Tr.  at  93.)  Applicant  has  resolved  his  state  tax  debt  with
consistent monthly payments, though he filed his 2013-2015 state tax returns in 2017,
long after their due date.
SOR ¶ 1.i: December 2016 judgment in favor of HOA in the amount of $1,339.
At the hearing, Applicant also introduced into evidence a court order quashing the HOA’s
garnishment of his bank account and ordering the Garnishee bank to return all garnished
funds  to  Applicant.  He  testified  that  he  was  able  to  have  the  judgment  and  the
garnishment  of  his  bank  account  vacated  because  he  was  never  notified  about  the
proceeding.  Also,  the  home  that  was  the  subject  of  the  HOA  dues  was  solely  the
responsibility of his wife and he had no obligation to pay these fees. The HOA judgment
was obtained against Applicant about 11 months after he left the home, and it was solely
occupied by his wife and her son at that time. (Tr. at 98-100; GE 3.)
SOR  ¶  2.a:  August  2016  DUI  arrest  and  guilty  plea  to  a  lesser  offense.
Applicant  admitted  that  he  used  poor  judgment  the  night  of  his  DUI  arrest.  He  had
consumed two beers at a bar where he was listening to music and then he drove home
when he was arrested. The police officer who stopped him said that he had swerved into
another lane. At the security clearance hearing, Applicant testified that he passed the field
sobriety test following the traffic stop by the police, though in his background interview,
he admitted that he failed the test. He was then given a breathalyzer test and his BAC
was over the legal limit at 0.9 grams. He pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and received
probation  before  judgment  in  December  2016.  He  was  given  a  one-year  period  of
probation, which he successfully completed. This arrest occurred after his January 2016
separation from his wife. He believes that the sinus medication he was taking that night
enhanced the effect of the alcohol he consumed. This was Applicant’s second DUI arrest.
The first occurred in 1995 when he was 27. That arrest is not alleged in the SOR. He no
longer  drinks  and  drives,  and  he  spends  his  limited  free  time  engaged  in  more
constructive activities. (Tr. at 52-54, 56-58, and 103.)
SOR  ¶  2.b:  January  2017  employment  termination  for  failing  to  report  DUI
arrest in compliance with employer’s security rules. With the consent of the parties,
I  amended  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  2.b  to  correct  a  scrivener’s  error  in  the  incorrect
reference to the allegation in SOR ¶2.a. Department Counsel also moved to amend this
allegation to conform to the evidence that the employer’s  self-reporting policy required
reporting within 12 hours of an arrest, not 12 days. With Applicant’s consent, I granted
the Government’s motion to amend this allegation, as noted. Applicant then entered his
admission to the modified allegation. (Tr. at 12-14.)
Applicant testified that after the DUI court action was completed, he brought the
court papers to his supervisor at his part-time employer and filled out a form disclosing
the arrest. The supervisor forwarded these documents to the “front office.”  He claimed
that he verbally reported the arrest and probation before judgment to his supervisor in or
about December 2016. He was told that he failed to report the arrest in a timely manner
and  was  suspended  pending  an  investigation.  He  was  subsequently  terminated  for
violating the employer’s policy after having worked there for ten years. Applicant testified
that he was unaware of the policy. He said that he notified the security officer at his full-
time  employer  shortly  after  his  arrest  and  subsequently  provided  the  court  paperwork
when his case was completed. Presently, Applicant only works at his full-time job. (GE 5
and 6; Tr. at 46, 58-67, 108.)
