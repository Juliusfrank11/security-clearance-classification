Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  supplier-diversity-specialist  currently  employed  by  a
defense contractor since February 2015. She earned her bachelor’s degree in 2008 and
her juris doctor in 2013. This is her first application for security clearance. (GX 1.)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges 22 past-due accounts totaling $17,762, 19 of
which are past-due medical accounts totaling $10,517. In her Answer, Applicant admits
each of the debts and explains their origin and current status. The delinquent debts are
reflected in Applicant’s credit bureau report (CBR) from April 2017, discussed during her
personal subject interview (PSI) from May 2017, and many are listed on her e-QIP from
January 2017. (GX 3; GX 2; GX 1.)
In 2012, Applicant was in law school, working a part-time job, and living at home
with her mother and two  younger siblings.  Her mother became gravely ill, and was no
longer  able  to  work.  Applicant  used  her  meager  earnings  and  took  additional  student
loans to pay the family’s living expenses, including the mortgage. Applicant fell behind on
the  payments  on  her  two  credit-card  accounts  that  she  had  opened  during  college.
Additionally,  Applicant  was  unable  to afford health  insurance.  She began  experiencing
medical issues and was diagnosed with an illness that required frequent blood screening
and sometimes required hospitalization. She amassed significant medical debt which she
was unable to pay due to the expenses of maintaining the family’s household. (Tr. 16-
19.)
After graduating from law school, Applicant worked as a law clerk from September
2013 until August 2014. She worked on a campaign for a senator from September 2014
until  December  2014.  Applicant  experientially  benefited  from  these  two  jobs,  but  they
were  not  lucrative.  She  was  unemployed  from  December  2014  until  she  started  her
current job in February 2015, which required her to move to another state. Applicant took
out  a  loan  to  help  with  moving  expenses,  including  the  requisite  down-payment  on  an
apartment of first and last month’s rent and a security deposit, which was approximately
$3,600. She had a long commute and spent a significant amount each month on gas and
tolls. At the end of 2016, Applicant was required by her employer to again relocate. She
took another loan to cover moving expenses. She completed repaying the two moving-
related loans in March 2017. (Tr. 38-39.) Her student loans are in good standing. (Tr. 40.)
Applicant then started addressing her delinquent debt. Her ongoing plan is to pay
off the smaller debts first and progress to the largest one. Applicant paid the $160 medical
debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.p. (AX B.) She settled-in-full the $2,286 delinquent credit-card
debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a and the $524 medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.q. (AX A; AX
D.) She entered a repayment plan in July 2017 with the medical creditor of SOR ¶¶ 1.b,
1.c, and 1.r. She has satisfied SOR ¶¶ 1.b - $122 and 1.c - $35, and owes approximately
$1,093  on  the  $1,308  account  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.r.  (Tr.  24-25.)  She  has  16  monthly
payments  of  $55  remaining  on  her  repayment  plan  with  the  creditor  of  SOR  ¶  1.p,  a
delinquent credit card originally $1,318 and now $823. (AX C.)
The creditor of the $3,641 credit-card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.o sought a default
judgment which was entered against Applicant in 2016. Applicant’s friend, an attorney,
successfully  petitioned  to  have  the  judgment  vacated  because  Applicant  was  never
served with notice. The attorney is now negotiating with the creditor on Applicant’s behalf
and is attempting to reach a settlement agreement. (AX E; Tr. 22-23.)
The $102, $166, and $108 medical debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g are
in collection with the same creditor. The $200, $40, and $65 debts are in collection with
another creditor. Applicant contacted the creditors to verify that the accounts were hers.
Applicant  stated  that  she  intended  to  enter  repayment  agreements  with  these  two
creditors in July 2018. (Tr. 26-28.)
The  remaining  accounts,  SOR  ¶¶  1.l  through  1.n  and  1.s  through  1.v,  totaling
$7,473 were incurred when Applicant had to be hospitalized for her medical condition and
was uninsured. Applicant will contact this creditor as soon as she is financially able to
enter into a repayment plan, which she anticipated would be the end of 2018. (Tr. 27-29.)
Applicant now earns approximately $73,000 annually in salary. (Tr. 38.) She lives
within her means and has not incurred any delinquent debt since 2014. (GX 3; Tr. 41-42.)
Applicant’s direct supervisor of over three years, who is aware of the nature of the SOR
allegations,  highly  recommends  Applicant  for  a  security  clearance,  stating  that  she  is
trustworthy  and  that  her  most  recent  performance  evaluation  rated  her  as  overall
exceeding  expectations.  (AX  F.)  Applicant  was  candid,  sincere,  and  credible  while
testifying.
