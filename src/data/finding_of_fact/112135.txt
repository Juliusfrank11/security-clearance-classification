Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a.~1.c., 1.e.~1.l, 1.o., and 2.a.
and 2.b. He denied SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.d., 1.m., and 1.n. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  66-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  pages  5
and 14.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since January of 2014. (GX
1 at page 14.) Applicant immigrated to the United States from Afghanistan in 1985, and
became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  1995.  (TR at  page  19  line  4  to  page  21  line  21.)
He is married to a naturalized U.S. citizen, and has two children. (Id.)
Guideline F – Financial Considerations
1.a. Applicant admits that from about 2003 until 2008 he lost about $40,000 due
to  gambling  at  a  local  casino.  (TR  at  page  24  line  17  to  page  27  line  10.)  Although,
Applicant has not gambled for about 10 years, he admits that his gambling is one of the
roots of his present financial difficulties. (Id.) The other root is periods of unemployment
and underemployment. (GX 1 at pages 15~21.)
1.b.~1.c.,  and  1.e.~1.l.  Applicant  admits  that  he  is  indebted  to  ten  separate
creditors  for  past-due  debts  totaling  about  $20,531.  (TR  at  page  24  line  4~16,  and  at
page  27  lines  11~21.)  Despite  having  been  given  a  month  to  address  these  admitted
past-due  debts,  Applicant  has  submitted  nothing  further  in  their  regard.  These
allegations are found against Applicant.
1.d. Applicant disputes that he is indebted to Creditor D for an alleged past-due
medical debt in the amount of about $5,014. (TR at page 21 line 25 to page 22 line 23.)
Despite  having  been  given  a  month  to  address  this  disputed  debt,  Applicant  has
submitted  nothing  further  in  this  regard.  As  this  debt  does  appear  as  past-due  on  the
Government’s July 2017 credit report, this allegation is found against Applicant. (GX 4
at page 2.)
1.m. Although Applicant initially denied this alleged past-due $155 medical debt
in his Answer to the SOR; at his hearing, Applicant admits that “this one may be true.”
(TR  at  page  21  line  25  to  page  22  line  23.)  Despite  having  been  given  a  month  to
address  this  debt,  Applicant  has  submitted  nothing  further  in  this  regard.  As  this  debt
does appear as past-due on the Government’s July 2017 credit report, this allegation is
found against Applicant. (GX 4 at page 3.)
1.n.    Applicant  denies  that  he  is  indebted  to  Creditor  N for an  alleged  past-due
utility debt in the amount of about $105. (TR at page 23 lines 6~23, and at page 36 line
9 to page 37 line 15.) Despite having been given a month to address this disputed debt,
Applicant has submitted nothing further in this regard. As this debt does appear as past-
due  on  the  Government’s  July  2017  credit  report,  this  allegation  is  found  against
Applicant. (GX 4 at page 3.)
1.o. Applicant admits that he has an outstanding state tax lien against him in the
amount of about $7,613. As Applicant has submitted nothing further in this regard, this
allegation is found against Applicant.
Guideline B – Foreign Influence
2.a. Applicant admits that his brother, who works in a pharmacy, and his 70-year-
old sister are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. (TR at page 29 line 22 to page 34
line 4.) As Applicant has very little contact with either of these siblings, this allegation is
found for Applicant.
2.b. Applicant admits that his mother-in-law and his father-in-law are citizens and
residents of Afghanistan. (TR at page 43 line 13 to page 44 line 13.) As Applicant has
very little contact with either of these in-laws, this allegation is found for Applicant.
