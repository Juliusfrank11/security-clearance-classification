Applicant is 64 years old, married with three adult children, the youngest of whom
was in college at the time of the hearing. The two oldest children are college graduates.
Applicant is a college graduate with a major in Accounting. In the near future, she plans
to take courses in preparation for the certified public accountants exam. From 1993 until
2016, Applicant was the owner and independent contractor of her own company. She did
consulting, financial analysis, and project management for federal agencies. Her husband
was  one  of  her  employees.  Since  March  2016,  Applicant  has  been  employed  as  an
accountant and auditor for a defense contractor. Since Sept 2016, her spouse has been
employed as a contract representative for a national accounting firm. (GE 1; Tr. 16-19,
55-56.) Although there were instances of personal financial and professional hardship,
discussed below, since 2016 Applicant and her spouse have had full-time employment
and make $108,000 and $175,000 per year, respectively. (Tr. 18-19, 54-55.)
The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file as required her federal income tax
returns for 1989, 1991 and 1992, 1995 and 1996, 2005 and 2006, 2009 through 2012,
and 2014 and 2015. The SOR also alleged that Applicant failed to file as required state
income tax returns for 1989, 1991 through 1996, 2003, 2005 and 2006, and 2008 through
2012. The SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to the federal government for delinquent
taxes  for  2011  ($69,849)  and  2012  ($5,225).  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-d.)  Applicant  denied  those
allegations and pleaded matters in mitigation, but she admitted that her federal and state
income tax returns were not timely filed. Applicant also contended that the 13 untimely
federal  filings  all  had  an  “allowable  six-month  ‘extension’”  and  that  seven  of  those  13
estimated a refund. She was advised by her tax preparer that timely filing was not required
if she was getting a refund. All of the late state and federal income tax returns were filed
between 1991 and 2012 (state) and 1991 and 2017 (federal). (Answer ¶¶ 1.a-d; Tr. 21,
57.)
Applicant attributed her failure to file federal and state income tax returns and pay
taxes due to a number of reasons: (1) in 1989 her father-in-law was diagnosed with cancer
and died in 1995; (2) Applicant and her spouse experienced job lay-offs due to downsizing
of companies they worked for; (3) in 2009 Applicant’s youngest sister was diagnosed with
cancer  and  her  husband  had  been  laid  off,  so  Applicant  and  her  spouse  financially
supported her sister, who had no medical insurance; her sister died in December 2013.
(Answer ¶¶ 1.a & b; AE U.)
The SOR also alleged 14 delinquent consumer debts totaling $105,093. (SOR ¶¶
1.e-r.) Applicant denied the allegations, answering that she is either “continuing to make
all monthly payments per [her] legal agreement with [the creditor]” (Answer ¶¶ 1.e-g, and
n),  or  that  she  has  “worked  with  [the  creditor]  to  establish  a  repayment  agreement”
(Answer ¶¶ 1.h-m, and o-r).
Applicant’s  first  financial  problems  (in  contrast  to  her  tax  filing  problems)
developed in 2009, when her sister was diagnosed with terminal cancer. At that time, her
sister’s spouse had been laid off. He had no income, nor did his wife, who had no medical
insurance. As a result, Applicant and her spouse assumed all of the financial burdens of
Applicant’s sister and her husband until her sister died. Applicant purchased a car for her
sister, so she could get to her treatments. Applicant’s sister and husband were living in a
hotel, which Applicant paid for by making cash transfers to her sister. (Tr. 49-50; GE 1;
AE U.)
Several  months  before  Applicant’s  sister  died,  Applicant  received  notification  in
April 2013 from one of her prime contractors, to which her company was a subcontractor,
that the federal agency was making significant contractual cuts due to sequestration. That
required Applicant to cut two of her five employees who were working on that subcontract.
One of those employees was her spouse; she had no discretion as to whom to cut as the
prime contractor specifically named her spouse as one of the two to be cut.  Applicant’s
spouse had worked for her company from 2009 to 2013. Applicant did not testify as to the
financial  impact  these  cuts  had,  but  it  is  fair  to  infer  that  the  effect  was  adverse  to
Applicant’s company and to the family finances. (Tr.51-54; AE T.)
Applicant  also  testified  about  college  expenses  for  her  three  children  in  that
timeframe.  Her  oldest  and  middle  daughters  were  in  private  colleges.  Together,  their
tuition,  books,  and  living  expenses  were  about  $50,000  to  $60,000  per  year.  They
graduated in 2013 and 2015. Applicant currently has one child, her son, who is in college,
and she pays his expenses. (Tr. 54.)
Applicant testified that the federal government sequestration and an early contract
termination caused reduced income from mid-2013 through the early contract termination
in  March 2016.  From mid-2013  through  2015,  Applicant  was  paying  all  her credit  card
debt every month. Applicant explained that she ran up significant credit card debt primarily
to  support  her  business.  It  was  “very  difficult  to  get  capital,  in  particular  when  [her]
subcontractor’s being cut back.” Applicant testified about an April 24, 2016 notice (AE S)
terminating  her  company’s  subcontract  that  was  supporting  a  federal  agency  prime
contract. The termination was unexpected and cancelled all funding for that project. That
termination  had  a  dramatically  adverse  effect  on  Applicant’s  business.  Before  the
termination, Applicant’s gross revenues had been at least $50,000 per month. It was her
sole source of income. After the termination, her income and her husband’s income went
to zero. From May 2016 until September 2016, her spouse was unemployed. (Tr. 18-19,
38-39, 49, 54-55, 60-61.) Applicant found full-time employment in March 2016.
Applicant  offered  exhibits  and  testimony  about  how  she  has  addressed  and  is
addressing  her  income  tax  problems.  Applicant  submitted  IRS  tax  transcripts  showing
monthly payments under installment plans for tax years 2009 through 2012  in amounts
varying from $3,000 in June 2013 until the last payment for tax year 2012 in September
2018 for $2,000 (AE X). She also provided documents showing monthly payments under
installment agreements for tax years 2009 through 2010 varying from $1,000 to $3,000
per month (Tr. 23-29, AE Z; AE AA through AE CC). She made no monthly payments to
the IRS from February through May 2016. When her payments were not in the amount
set forth in the latest installment agreement, the IRS accepted the payments and credited
them  to  another  tax  year.  (AE  X;  GE  5,  p.  25.)  Notwithstanding  Applicant’s  payments
under IRS payment plans, she still needs to defray about $70,000 in tax arrearages for
2011, which is the approximate amount alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. (Tr. 73-74.)
Applicant currently has applied with the IRS for a new payment plan, and she was
not certain if her recent payments were under an existing plan.  (Tr.  62-64.) The latest
IRS agreement signed by Applicant and her spouse is dated May 29, 2018, and applies
to  tax  years  2011  and  2012  with  a  balance  due  of  $70,096  with  $2,000  in  monthly
payments. (AE BB.)  That same exhibit also includes the first page of an IRS letter dated
July, 25, 2018, acknowledging receipt of an installment agreement for tax year 2017. It
instructs Applicant to continue to make payments under any existing agreement while the
IRS  processes  the  latest  request.  (AE  BB.)  To  recap,  Applicant  has  been  under  IRS
payment plans regularly, if not necessarily continuously, since May 31, 2013 to present.
(AE X; AE Z; AE AA; AE BB.) She currently continues to make monthly payments to the
IRS of $2,000. (Tr. 71-73.)
Applicant  has  not  filed  her  federal  income  tax  return  for  2016,  which  is  “being
worked on by someone else” because she does not have the time. Applicant has not filed
her federal return for 2017; she claims that it is not due until October 2018 because of an
extension. No document was submitted at the hearing or post-hearing showing such an
extension. Applicant does not know if she owes any federal taxes for 2016 or 2017. She
has not filed her state income tax returns for 2016 or 2017. (Tr. 74-75.)
Applicant testified about SOR ¶¶ 1. e and f, two signature loans with a credit union
($826 past due, $24,761 bal.). Applicant’s documents show monthly payments ($620) to
this creditor since October 2017. (Tr. 36-38; AE A; AE Y, pp. 6-10.) These accounts are
being resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.g  is  a  credit  card  account  ($233  past  due,  bal.  $1,247).  (Tr.  38-39.)
Applicant’s documents showed a statement payment due date of February 24, 2018 for
$29.00; it did not report that that amount, or any amount, was paid by that date. (AE B.)
Another document showed $29.00 paid on August 24, 2018. (AE Y, pp. 3-4.)
SOR ¶ 1.h is a credit card account charged off by the creditor ($18,452).  Applicant
promised to submit payment documents post-hearing. (Tr. 39-40.) Applicant’s documents
showed one payment of $100 on September 28, 2018 (AE GG.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.i and j are two credit cards charged off by the creditor ($16,267). (Tr. 41-
42.) Applicant’s documents showed a first payment of $100 on September 17, 2018, with
five additional monthly payments scheduled, the second one  to be paid on September
19, 2018. (AE C; AE HH; AE II.)
SOR  ¶  1.k  is  a  credit  card  charged  off  by  the  creditor  ($13,946).  (Tr.  42.)
Applicant’s  documents  showed  a  one-time  payment  on  September  17,  2018,  but  no
amount  was  stated.  (AE  D.)  Applicant’s  post-hearing  submissions  did  not  provide  any
additional documents about this debt. (AE Z through AE PP.)
SOR ¶ 1.l is an account placed for collection by the creditor ($1,419). (Tr. 43-44.)
Applicant promised to submit payment documents post-hearing. Applicant’s post-hearing
submission showed one payment to the collection agent of $100 on September 18, 2018.
(AE FF; AE JJ.)
SOR ¶ 1.m is an account charged off by the creditor ($8,822). Applicant’s AE E
refers to two different accounts with this creditor but does not refer to the account that is
the subject of this SOR allegation. The correct exhibit shows monthly of payments of $620
being paid from October 17, 2017 to September 6, 2018. (AE Y, p. 8 (no payment was
made in August 2018).) (Tr. 44-45.) This account is being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.n is a credit card account ($1,619 past due, bal. $40,290). Applicant was
referred to AE F, which showed a minimum payment due date of February 16, 2018 but
did not show any payment made. A more recent statement showed no past due payment
and previous payments made of $707 with no available credit. (AE Y, p. 11; Tr. 45-46.)
SOR ¶ 1.o, an account that has been charged off by the creditor ($17,913). (Tr.
46.) Applicant’s documentation for this account shows a schedule of automatic monthly
bank debits prepared by collection counsel from July 21, 2017, to June 21, 2018 ($620).
(AE  E;  AE  G.)  This  appears  to  be  a  duplicate  of  SOR  ¶  1.m.  If  it  not  a  duplicate,  this
account is being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.p is an account that has been charged off by the creditor ($5,949). She
said she was on a monthly payment plan and would submit documentation post-hearing.
(Tr. 46-47.) Applicant submitted documents showing one payment of $100 on October 3,
2018. (AE LL.)
SOR ¶ 1.q is an account that has been charged off by the creditor ($8,895). She
said that she is on a payment plan and would provide documentation post-hearing. (Tr.
47.) Applicant’s post-hearing submission showed one payment of $100 on September 28,
2018, to collection counsel. (AE MM.)
SOR ¶ 1.r is an account that has been charged off by the creditor ($10,752). She
testified that she is on a payment agreement and referred to AE H. (Tr. 47.) That exhibit
shows four monthly payments of $100 from September 17, 2018, through December 30,
2018.
Applicant submitted three letters of recommendation. The first author praised her
“quality of work and attention to detail” and had a high regard for her “professional integrity
and strength of character.” A second author lauded Applicant as “highly professional and
honest” and that her “dedication and loyalty to the mission [was] unwavering.” The third
author noted  her  “great  integrity,  both  personally  and  professionally” and  that  she  was
highly  “trustworthy.” The  authors had  known  Applicant for 10  years  or more.  Applicant
testified that the authors were aware of the SOR allegations. (AE O; Tr. 47-48.) Applicant
provided  documents  that  she  enrolled  in  and  completed  an  online  financial  education
program on September 26, 2018. (AE DD.)
