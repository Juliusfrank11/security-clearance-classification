Applicant  admitted the  allegations  in  the  SOR  in  ¶¶  1.d and  1.e. He  denied  the
allegations in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.f, and 1.g. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings
and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 46 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1995. He was married
from  2000  to  2014,  and  has  three  children,  ages  16,  14,  and  11  years  old  from  the
marriage. The children live with their mother. He pays $850 per month in child support.
He remarried in 2015 and has two stepchildren. Applicant has been employed by federal
contractors since 2001.2
The  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  are  corroborated  by  Applicant’s  admissions  and
credit reports from March 2016 and July 2017.3
Applicant attributed his delinquent debts to his ex-wife who he said managed their
finances  and  was  responsible  for  paying  their  bills.  They  had  agreed  early  in  their
marriage that she would handle the finances. He had always lived frugally and was raised
in a fiscally responsible family. He first learned that she was not paying their bills in 2001
or 2002. He testified he had been saving money to take a trip. When he went to withdraw
the money, the account was empty. Applicant stated that this happened several times.
Each time his wife told him she had used the money to pay bills. He admitted to being
naive.  He  wanted  to  believe  she  was  doing  the  right  thing.  He  was  unaware  that  her
spending habits were escalating, and her purchases were for high-end and luxury items.
1 Hearing Exhibit (HE) I is the Government’s discovery letter. HE II is Applicant’s email submitting additional
documents. HE III is Government Counsel’s email noting there were no objections to Applicant’s additional
exhibits. Applicant’s attorney timely submitted additional documents that he marked as AE O and P. He
previously submitted exhibits marked AE O and P. I have remarked the additional exhibits as AE Q and R.

He stated he was never a shopper and did not notice her expensive choices. She used
credit cards to purchase these items.4
When  Applicant  and  his  wife  divorced,  as  part  of  the  marital  distribution,  he
received the house and was responsible for the two mortgages (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-$49,696 and
1.d). He was also responsible for the credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.f ($7,548). The house
was  foreclosed.  In  2015,  he  received  an  IRS  Form  1099-A,  abandonment  of  secured
property from the lender. He testified he filed the form with his federal income tax returns.5
Applicant remained responsible for the second mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.a).6
In  April  2016,  Applicant’s  ex-wife  filed  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  to  address  the
marital debts she was responsible for in the divorce decree. Included in her bankruptcy
were the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.f and 1.g. Applicant testified that he never discussed
including his debts in her bankruptcy. He is listed as the co-debtor for the debts in SOR
¶¶  1.a,  1.c,  and  1.g.  Applicant  provided  a  notarized  letter  from  his  ex-wife  that  she  is
current on her Chapter 13 bankruptcy payments. Applicant testified that he did not pursue
resolving any of the debts that his ex-wife included in her bankruptcy. He assumed they
would be resolved by the bankruptcy. They are being paid through the bankruptcy.7
Applicant  admitted  responsibility  for  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  ($9,726).  He  made
payment  arrangements  in  September  2013  and  paid  $35  until  December  2017.  He
increased his payments to $100 in January 2018 and has made consistent payments.8
This debt is being resolved.
Applicant testified that he has participated in financial counseling. He provided a
detailed  written  budget.  His  wife  is  employed  and  he  manages  their  finances.  He  has
savings  and  investments.  He  provided  copies  of  awards  and  character  letters.  He  is
described as outstanding, hardworking, responsible, valued, honest and trustworthy.9
A  character  witness  testified  that  he  has  known  Applicant  for  11  months  and
considered  him  knowledgeable  and  experienced.  He  has  never  seen  him  act

Applicant’s ex-wife’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy, Applicant, as the joint owner and co-debtor may still be liable
for the debts once his ex-wife’s bankruptcy is discharged. Applicant is also listed in the bankruptcy as co-
debtor for SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.g.

considers him very reliable and honest.10
