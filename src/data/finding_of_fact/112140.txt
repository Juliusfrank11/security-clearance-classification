Applicant  admitted  to  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  2.a.,  and  2.b.  He  denied  SOR
allegations  ¶¶  1.a.,  and  3.a.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,
exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 18 line
23  to  page  19  line  9,  and  GX  1  at  page  5.)  He  has  been  employed  with  the  defense
contractor since “April of” 2017. (GX 1 at page 5.) Applicant was terminated by his prior
employer in September of 2015 for “Policy Violations,” that will be discussed at length,
below.  (GX  3.)  He  served  in  the  Marine  Corp  from  2000~2006,  achieving  the  rank  of
Sergeant. (AppX C at page 3.)

1.a.,  2.a.  and  2.b.  Applicant  admits  that  at  his  prior  employment  he  installed
unauthorized software, a Mouse Jiggler,” which prevented his “screen from locking out.”
(TR at page  24  line  23  to page  31  line  6.)  He  avers that  he  was  “unaware  that  it  was
unauthorized,” as he was introduced to it “by a senior administrator that(sic) was acting
as a mentor to . . . [Applicant] at that time.” (Id, and TR at page 84 lines 4~17.) Applicant
has  offered  five  undated  letters  of  support  from  those  he  works  with  at  his  current
employer, but nothing to corroborate averment regarding the unauthorized software.
1.a., and 3.a. Applicant denies that he created five administrated accounts, some
in the names of coworkers, on a classified system without approval. (TR at page 31 line
7 to page 45 line 8, at pages 50 line 15 to page 51 line 3, and at page 55 line 11 to page
68 line 5.) He avers this misconduct was authorized. (TR at page 83 line 25 to page 84
line 3.) However, Applicant has submitted nothing further in support of his averment.
1.a. Applicant denies that he falsified his time card over a seven day period. (TR
at page 45 line 19 to page 50 line 14.) His “Desktop’ was monitored by his employer for
seven of a planned ten days. (AppX A at page 1.) During this period, Applicant “spent”
the  majority  of  his  “Active  Time  on  Non-Work  related  activities  .  .  .  included  doing
homework, browsing online retailers, and watching YouTube videos.” (Id.) I find that this
was a clear misuse of information technology.
