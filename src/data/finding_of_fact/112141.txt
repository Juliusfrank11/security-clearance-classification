After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I find that the debt in SOR ¶
1.j is an earlier balance of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e and does not represent a new debt.
Additional findings of fact follow.
Applicant is a 58-year-old software engineer with a bachelor’s degree awarded in
May 1981. (GE 1; Tr. 57.) He and his spouse separated in 2014 after 23 years of marriage,
although  they  were in the process of reconciling as of May 2018. (Tr. 59.) He and his
spouse have two grown children, now ages 21 and 25. Applicant was granted a top secret
security  clearance  and  sensitive  compartmented  information  (SCI)  access  eligibility  in
2010. His latest background investigation was conducted while he was working for his
previous defense-contractor employer (company X). (GEs 1-2.) In January 2018, Applicant
began working for another defense contractor, and he needs a secret clearance for his
current employment. (Tr. 23, 29, 58.)
Applicant built his home in 1997. In 1998, he and his spouse obtained their first
mortgage.  (Tr.  64.)  Over  the  years,  he  and  his  spouse  relied  on  consumer  credit  for
purchases. His spouse did not work outside the home for most of their marriage, but he
earned  enough  income  to  where  he  did  not  see  a  need  to  monitor  their  spending  or
maintain  a  household  budget.  Applicant  earned  $152,805  in  2000  while  working  as  a
consultant. (GEs 1-2; AE A.)
In 2004, after about six months of unemployment (Tr. 63), Applicant began working
in a permanent position as a principle software engineer with a commercial company at
less income than as a consultant but with more security. His salary was $90,979 in 2005.
(GE 1; Answer; AE E; Tr. 54.) In 2008, Applicant began working for company X. (GE 1; Tr.
23.)
Applicant twice refinanced the mortgage on his home to pay off some credit-card
debts. (GE 2; Answer; Tr. 50.) Available credit reports (GEs 3-4; AEs A-D) show he and his
spouse obtained a 30-year mortgage loan in 2005 for $378,000, to be repaid at $2,263 per
month. They made their mortgage payments on time for several years. (GE 3.)
On the death of his mother, Applicant inherited some funds in approximately 2012
that  he  admits  he  mismanaged.  (Tr. 86-87.)  Despite  some  financial  strain,  his spouse
refused to look for work outside the home. (GE 2.)
In  December  2013,  Applicant  notified  his  supervisor  and  security  officer  that,
through financial mismanagement on his part, his monthly mortgage obligation was half of
his take-home pay. While he was not then behind on any accounts, he had accrued credit-
card debt over time. He indicated that he realized that he had to deal with his financial
situation  and  had  engaged  the  services  of  a  financial  advisor.  His mortgage  loan  was
current, but the principal balance was higher than his home was worth so a conventional
refinance was “all but impossible.” Applicant added that he and his spouse were taking
measures  to  further  reduce  their  expenses  and  create  additional income,  including  by
selling assets. (AE A.)
Struggling  to  make  the  monthly  minimum  payment  on  his  credit-card  debts,
Applicant retained a bankruptcy attorney with the intention of filing a Chapter 13 wage-
earner plan.1 (Tr. 66-67.) His income was too high for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. (Tr.
68.) In September 2014, Applicant updated his financial situation for his employer. He
indicated that he planned to file for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy within the next 90 days and
1 Applicant testified that he first talked to a bankruptcy attorney after he and his spouse separated, “probably
[in] August or September of 2014.” (Tr. 67.) However, he informed his then employer that he had stopped
paying on his home loan and his credit-card accounts on the advice of the bankruptcy attorney in anticipation
of  the  bankruptcy  filing.  Available  credit  reports  show  that  he  made  no  payments  on  some  credit-card
accounts after June 2014, so it is likely that he consulted with a bankruptcy attorney before August 2014.
expected to pay a manageable $450 a month under his Chapter 13 plan. He had stopped
paying his credit-card debts because they were to be included in the bankruptcy, and his
accounts were 90 days past due. His mortgage loan was 60 days past due, but he was
working to refinance his loan through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP).
His employer notified the government that Applicant was having some financial issues. (AE
A.)
For a periodic investigation of his security clearance eligibility, Applicant completed
and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on
November 3, 2015. In response to the financial record inquiries, Applicant indicated that he
stopped paying on his credit cards on the advice of a bankruptcy attorney. His mortgage
servicer was not willing to work with him before he fell behind 60 days on his loan and
indicated that he would be filing a bankruptcy petition. He disclosed that he and his spouse
were  currently  working  with  their  mortgage  servicer  to  modify  their  loan  under  HAMP.
Applicant indicated that he made some mortgage payments by selling assets, but it was
not a sustainable plan going forward. To obtain a modification under the HAMP, he needed
to file a separation agreement with his wife, who would then sign a quitclaim deed.  He
anticipated that the modification of his mortgage would free up about $600 per month in
income.  Applicant  responded  affirmatively  to  inquiries  about  financial  delinquency  on
routine accounts. He disclosed that he was delinquent on the accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a
($24,000), 1.b ($3,000), 1.c ($5,000), 1.d ($950), and 1.e ($1,000); on his home mortgage;
and on two consumer credit-card accounts (not alleged in the SOR) that were past due for
$6,000  and  $8,000.  Applicant  attributed  his  consumer-credit  delinquencies  to  his
mismanagement of his inheritance and his sizeable mortgage obligation, which limited his
ability to make his credit card payments. He planned to resolve his credit-card debts by a
Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing. Applicant denied any intention to rely on consumer credit for
any purchases in the future. (GE 1.)
In November 2015, the creditor owed the $8,000 debt agreed to settle Applicant’s
balance of $7,027 for $2,811, payable in two payments of $1,405. (AE L.) The debt was
settled in December 2015. (GE 3.) Regarding the $6,000 credit-card delinquency reported
on his SF 86, Applicant obtained a credit card in May 2013 with a $6,000 credit limit. He
made  no  payments  on  the  account  after May  2014  and  reportedly  owed  $6,127  as  of
December 2015. (GE 4; AEs B-D.) In approximately late January 2016, after the creditor
sought a judgment against him (AE K), Applicant legally settled the debt for less than its full
balance.2 (AEs A-D.)
Applicant and his spouse’s mortgage loan was rated as past due throughout 2015. It
was past due for $9,805 as of November 2015, but was successfully modified in January
2016. (AE A.) Applicant has been current on the mortgage payments since then. (GE 4.)
As of mid-January 2016, some of his credit-card accounts had been charged off, and some
medical debts were reportedly in collection for $30 (SOR ¶ 1.g), $10 (SOR ¶ 1.h), and $10
(SOR ¶ 1.i). (GE 3.)
2 The letter from the creditor indicating that the debt was settled is dated January 28, 2016. A court record,
dated March 1, 2016, shows that the creditor voluntarily withdrew its action. (AE K.) The file does not include
the amount paid in settlement.
As of January 2016, Applicant had not filed for bankruptcy, apparently because his
attorney  “kept  trying  to  figure  out  the  right  formula”  for  a  Chapter  13  filing.  (Tr.  68.)
Applicant  looked  into  alternative  ways  to  address  his  debt,  and,  in  early  2016,  he
discovered  a  “commonsense” program  advocated  by  a  radio  personality  who reported
success in helping people out of debt. Applicant learned the value of budgeting, of having a
long-term financial plan, and of debt inhibiting the accumulation of net worth. He started
selling some assets to build a cash emergency fund of $1,000. (Answer; Tr. 48-49.) He
sold  a  2007  or  2008  model-year vehicle,  but  he  did  not  have  enough  money  to  make
settlement offers on most of his delinquent credit-card debts. (Tr. 68-69.)
In December 2016, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  He  admitted  that  he  had  mismanaged  his
inheritance  and  had  neglected  to  manage  his  money.  He  had  no  explanation  for  his
outstanding credit-card balances other than that he bought things that he did not need. He
described himself as “house poor” because he had twice rolled credit-card debt into his
home mortgage loan. He explained that after he refinanced, he continued to charge items
on credit. On the advice of a bankruptcy attorney, he stopped paying on his some bills in
2014 so that he would be eligible for a bankruptcy filing and “special mortgage rewrite
programs.” However, he later decided against filing for bankruptcy. He contacted some of
his creditors and began negotiating settlements. He indicated that he would be making
arrangements in early 2017 to settle other credit-card balances that had been charged off
or placed for collection. Applicant denied using any credit cards after 2014. He paid down
some of his debt by withdrawing some 401(k) assets, and he expressed his intention to
withdraw the rest of the account (estimated at $31,000) to make debt payments. Applicant
explained that he did not want to withdraw all of his retirement funds in the same year
because  of  the  tax  consequences  and  the  loss  of  “thousands  of  dollars.”  Applicant
indicated that he was following the financial advice of a radio personality, who advocated
repaying  smaller  debts  first,  not  applying  for  new  credit,  paying  only  in  cash,  and
establishing a budget. After he accumulated some emergency savings and improved his
credit score, he planned to refinance his mortgage loan from a 30-year to a 15-year loan.
Applicant did not recognize the medical collection debts on his record, but indicated that he
would pay them if they were owed. (GE 2.)
By  August  2017,  Applicant  had  not  made  the  promised  payments  toward  his
consumer-credit  delinquencies,  and  the  DOD  CAF  issued  the  SOR.  In  October  2017,
Applicant responded that he had $11,000 in reserve cash, $10,000 of which he would use
to pay down debt. (Answer.) At his hearing, Applicant attributed the delay in addressing his
past-due  debts  in  part  to  “trouble  making  additions  to  the  amount  of  money  [he]  had
stashed.” He was concerned that if he needed a new roof or a water heater, he might not
have the funds available to pay for them. (Tr. 75-76.)
In late January 2018, Applicant left company X for a higher-paying position with his
current  defense  contractor  employer.  His  annual  salary  increased  from  $118,000  to
$150,000, and he was paid a signing bonus of $15,000 after taxes. (Tr. 52, 99-100.) He
spent about $1,000 of the bonus on tires for his spouse’s vehicle, but could not account for
the rest of the money. (Tr. 87, 99-100.)
Available evidence reflects the following delinquency and payment histories for the
SOR debts as of June 2018:
Charged-off credit card for $22,854 (SOR ¶ 1.a)
Applicant’s credit-card account with a credit union, which he opened in February
1999, was charged off for $22,854 in December 2014. Date of last activity on the account
was April 2014. As of September 2017, Applicant had made no payment on the balance.
(GEs 1-4; AEs A-D.) In mid-February 2018, after he received the signing bonus from his
current employer (Tr. 71), Applicant submitted an offer of $8,000 to the credit union to
settle the debt. (AEs J, M.) As of mid-May 2018, he had $9,000 in his emergency fund and
$1,000  in his checking account, which was not enough to settle the debt, although he
testified that he had a small gun collection that he could sell for an estimated $10,000. (Tr.
50, 72, 82.) He had $178,000 in a retirement account with company X that he could access
because he is no longer employed by the company, although he was concerned about
maximizing  his  money.3  (Tr.  83.)  In  late  May  2018,  the  credit  union  agreed  to  accept
$12,190,  payable  by  June  25,  2018,  to  settle  the  $22,854  balance.  (AE  Q.)  Applicant
expressed an intention to withdraw some of his retirement funds to settle this debt and the
overdraft debt in SOR ¶ 1.d, but he was waiting for his accountant to inform him about the
correct amount to withdraw so that he is “prepared for any taxes due on both the settled
debts and the early withdrawal from [his] retirement.” (AE S; Tr. 70.) As of the close of the
evidentiary record, there was no evidence that the debt had been paid or settled.
Charged-off credit card for $4,515 (SOR ¶ 1.b)
Applicant opened a credit-card account with a retailer in April 2011. His account was
charged off for $5,326 in December 2014 due to nonpayment after June 2014. (GE 3.) As
of January 2017, the creditor was reporting a past-due balance of $4,515. (GE 4; AEs A-D;
Tr. 79.) On August 9, 2017, the creditor cancelled $3,472.86 of debt and issued a 1099-C,
Cancellation of Debt form to Applicant for tax year 2017.4 (AE I; Tr. 79.) Applicant testified
that  he  paid  taxes  on  the  amount  of  cancelled  debt  (Tr. 54),  although  he  provided  no
corroborating documentation.
Charged-off credit card for $3,510 (SOR ¶ 1.c)
Applicant’s credit-card account with a retailer, which he opened in October 2011,
was charged off and placed for collection for $3,510 in June 2015 after nonpayment since
3 When asked whether he would be willing to withdraw retirement assets to pay the $22,854 debt, Applicant
responded:
If it comes down to it, I’m going to have to. I don’t want to, but only because, as it stands, the
future value of that $22,000 comes out to more like half a million in 12 to 14 years, at roughly
8 to 9 percent growth. (Tr. 83.)
4 Applicant testified that he called the creditor several times about a settlement, the first time in “roughly”
November 2017, but the creditor elected to cancel the debt. (Tr. 73.) The 1099-C shows that the creditor
cancelled the debt before November 2017.
November 2014. (GEs 1-4; AEs A-D.) In mid-May 2018, the creditor agreed to settle the
debt for $1,580 payable in a lump sum by June 16, 2018. Applicant paid the $1,580 on
May 24, 2018. (AE P.)
Charged-off credit line for $740 (SOR ¶ 1.d)
Applicant opened an overdraft-protection account in April 2002 with a $1,000 limit. In
late January 2015, a $740 balance was charged off to profit and loss. (GEs 1-4; AEs A-D.)
In  mid-February  2018,  Applicant  notified  the  creditor  of  his  willingness  to  pay  the  full
balance to settle the debt. (AE J.) On May 30, 2018, the creditor gave him until June 25,
2018, to pay the debt. (AE Q.) He expressed his intention to withdraw retirement funds to
pay the debt. (AE S.) As of the close of the record, there was no evidence that the debt
had been paid or settled.
Charged-off credit card for $408 (SOR ¶ 1.e, duplicated in SOR ¶ 1.j)
Applicant  opened  a  credit-card  account  with  a  home-improvement  retailer  in
September 2001. He made no payments on the account after June 2014, and a $670
collection  balance  was  owed  as  of  June  2015.  (GE  1,  3.)  As  of  November  2016,  the
creditor was reporting a charged-off $408 balance. (GE 4; AEs A-D.) Applicant had not
paid the debt by late May 2018. He expressed an intention to pay the debt after his debts
with the credit union (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.d) have been settled. (AE M; Tr. 54.)
Medical collection debt for $100 (SOR ¶ 1.f)
In  September  2016,  a  $100  medical  debt  from  March  2016  was  placed  for
collection.  (GE 4; AEs B-D.) Applicant asserted in October 2017 that the debt was for
service  at  a  medical  center  and  that  it  had  been  paid  off  for  a  long  time.  (Answer.)
Available billing information for outpatient surgery at the medical center in March 2016
shows that $100 was paid by credit card on February 3, 2017, and he had no outstanding
balance as of May 2018. (AE G.) Available credit reports confirm that the debt was paid in
2017. (AEs B-D.)
Medical collection debt for $30 (SOR ¶ 1.g)
In November 2015, a $30 medical debt from June 2015 was placed for collection.
(GEs 3-4.) Applicant asserted in October 2017 that the debt was a medical co-payment
that he paid at the time of service. (Answer.) The debt was still on his credit record as of
January 2017, but the information showing the outstanding collection balance was from
December 2015. (GE 4.) The debt was not on his credit record with Equifax as of May
2018.5 (AE C.) Applicant presented a document from a medical practice, showing that he
5 Applicant presented credit reports from Trans Union (AE B), Equifax (AE C), and Experian (AE D) dated May
10, 2018. Trans Union listed no collection debts. Equifax listed only the collection debt in SOR ¶ 1.f. Applicant
entered in evidence an incomplete copy of his Experian credit report, which does not include the collections
section.
had a zero balance on his account as of May 2018 (AE H), although there is no evidence to
tie the medical provider to the collection debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.g-1.i.
Medical collection debt for $10 (SOR ¶ 1.h)
In July 2015, a $10 medical debt from February 2015 was placed for collection.
(GEs 3-4.) Applicant asserted in October 2017 that the debt was a medical co-payment
that he paid at the time of service. (Answer.) While the debt was still on his credit record as
of January 2017, the information showing the outstanding collection balance was from
November 2015. (GE 4.) The debt was not on his credit record with Equifax as of May
2018. (AE C.)
Medical collection debt for $10 (SOR ¶ 1.i)
In April 2015, a $10 medical debt from October 2014 was placed for collection. (GEs
3-4.) Applicant asserted in October 2017 that the debt was a medical co-payment that he
paid at the time of service. (Answer.) While the debt was still on his credit record as of
January 2017, the information showing the outstanding collection balance was from June
2015. (GE 4.) The debt was not on his credit record with Equifax as of May 2018. (AE C.)
Applicant has no open credit-card accounts for which he is legally responsible. (GE
4;  AEs  B-D.)  He  pays  cash  for  purchases.  (Tr.  82.)  Applicant  and  his  spouse’s  joint
mortgage loan had a balance of $290,772 as of May 2018. Monthly payments on the loan
of $2,880 were being paid on time. The current interest rate on the loan is 5.99%. He
would like to refinance for a 15-year loan with a lower interest rate. (Tr. 53.) Applicant
cosigned a student loan for his older daughter. The loan has a balance of $27,029 that his
daughter  was  repaying  at  $234  per  month.  His  credit  was  rated  as  fair  by  the  credit-
reporting agencies. (AEs B-C; Tr. 62.) His budget for June 2018 showed that his monthly
expenses equal his income with $1,000 going toward his retirement and almost $745 to his
emergency  fund.  (AE  R.)  He  testified  that  he  will  never  again  become  financially
overextended. (Tr. 56.) He asserted that he has had a monthly surplus of about $1,000
since his first paycheck with his current employer in February 2018. (Tr. 80.) However, he
admitted that he had not stayed within his budget in that $750 of the $1,000 was being
spent every month on activities such as “eating out too often.” He also purchased a ham
radio and two other minor items. (Tr. 81-83.)
As  of  May  2018,  Applicant’s  first  priority  was  retaining  his  home.  His  younger
daughter and her husband live with him. (Tr. 50, 62.) His daughter gives him $120 a month
to offset the cost of her cellphone plan and her car insurance. (T. 61.) In May 2018, he paid
$2,500 for a class for his daughter to help her obtain a higher-paying job. (Tr. 81, 88.)
Applicant has had no other large, unexpected expenses in the last two years. (Tr. 88.)
Applicant’s supervisor at company X from 2008 until January 2018 corroborated that
Applicant  self-reported  that  he  had  financial  issues.  To  his  knowledge,  Applicant  had
violated no security practices or procedures. He observed Applicant to handle classified
information  appropriately.  He  recommended  continued  security  clearance  eligibility  for
Applicant with the caveat that Applicant reconcile his financial situation. He understands
that Applicant left company X in part to fix his financial situation. (Tr. 24-30.)
