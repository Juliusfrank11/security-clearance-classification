Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except ¶ 1.f. He is 36 years old. He
graduated from high school in 2000, and he attended some college, but did not earn a
degree. He is married. He has one stepchild and two children; all are minors.1
Applicant has worked for various DOD contractors since 2001. He has worked as
a  courier  and  support-service  specialist  for  his  current  employer,  a  DOD  contractor,
since March 2018. He has held a security clearance since 2001.2
The  SOR  alleges  ten  delinquent  consumer  accounts  totaling  $12,631  (SOR  ¶¶
1.a - 1.c, 1.f - 1.l) and one delinquent medical debt for $153 (SOR ¶ 1.d). It also alleges
that  Applicant  filed  chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  2008  and  received  a  discharge  in  2009
(SOR  ¶  1.e).  The  allegations  are  established  by  Applicant’s  admissions,  credit  reports
from  November  2015,  July  2017,  and  May  2018,  and  Applicant’s  bankruptcy  record.
Applicant  also  disclosed  and  discussed  his  debts  and  his  bankruptcy  on  his  2015
security clearance application (SCA) and during his 2017 background interview.3
Applicant  attributed  his  delinquent  debts  and  his  bankruptcy  to  the  following
factors:  (1)  medical  expenses  incurred  after  a  2001  car  accident;  (2)  moving  costs
incurred  in  2006;  (3)  burial  expenses  of  $900  in  2008  and  2010;  (4)  $1,500  in
unauthorized charges that he incurred around 2010 when his identity was stolen; (5) he
was the primary breadwinner after his marriage in 2011 through the birth of his children
in  2012;  (6)  he  assisted  his  mother  with  paying  for  her  medication  in  February  and
March  2018;  and  (7)  he  has  assisted  with  caring  for  his  grandmother.  Despite  these
factors, he traveled overseas for tourism in 2009 and 2015. He testified that by the time
of  his  2017  background  interview,  he  was  already  in  the  process  of  trying  to  resolve
some of his delinquent accounts, to include SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c. He also testified that

he had scheduled payments in September 2017 to resolve some of the SOR debts, as
further discussed below.4
SOR  ¶  1.a  is  for  a  $10,321  charged-off  auto  loan  account  for  Applicant’s  used
car  which  was  purchased  in  2009  and  voluntarily  repossessed  in  2011.  He  became
delinquent  because  he  did  not  have  the  money  to  pay  for  necessary  repairs.  He
established  a  $200  monthly  payment  plan  in  September  2017  that  was  scheduled  to
begin  in  October  2017  and  continue  through  September  2020.  With  the  exception  of
missing  two  monthly  payments  in  February  and  March  2018,  he  testified  that  he  has
otherwise abided by the plan. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim
of payments for this debt.5
SOR ¶ 1.b is for a $651 delinquent auto account that Applicant cosigned for his
wife. He testified that he was unsure why the account became delinquent because she
was  responsible  for  paying  it.  He  testified  that  she  brought  the  account  current  in
December  2017,  and  he  expected  that  the  account  would  be  fully  paid  by  September
2018.  His  most  recent  credit  reports  from  May  2018  corroborate  his  claim  that  this
account is current.6
SOR  ¶  1.c  is  for  a  $574  charged-off  credit  card.  Applicant  testified  that  he
established  a  monthly  payment  plan  in  September  2017,  and  he  paid  this  debt  by
November 2017. His most recent credit reports from May 2018 corroborate his claim.7
SOR ¶ 1.d is for a $153 delinquent medical account. Applicant was unsure about
the origin of this debt, but he testified that he paid it in full in September 2017. He did
not  provide  documentation  to  corroborate  his  claim  of  payment.  While  this  debt  was
reported  on  his  2015  and  2017  credit  reports,  it  was  no  longer  reported  on  his  most
recent credit report from 2018.8
SOR ¶ 1.f is for a $562 delinquent cable account. Applicant denied this debt. He
testified that he has not had an account with this cable company since 2006, when he
ended  service  with  the  company  and  returned  the  associated  equipment.  He  testified
that he unsuccessfully attempted to contact the company in September 2017 to dispute
the  account,  and  he  intended  to  re-contact  the  company  to  close  out  any  outstanding
accounts.  He  had  not  yet  disputed  the  account  through  the  credit  bureaus.  While  this
debt  was  reported  on  his  2015  credit  report,  it  was  no  longer  reported  on  his  most
recent credit reports from 2017 and 2018.9
4 Tr. at 30-32, 51, 56, 60-62, 69-72; GE 1, 2.
5 Tr. at 29-33, 51-52, 62-65, 70-71; GE 2, 3, 4; AE A, C.
6 Tr. at 33-34, 62-65, 69-72; AE C.
7 Tr. at 34-35, 51, 62-65, 69-72; GE 3; AE C.
8 Tr. at 35-37, 62-67; GE 3, 4; AE C.
9 Tr. at 37-39, 62-68; GE 3, 4; AE C.
SOR ¶¶ 1.g through 1.l are for six traffic tickets totaling $523. Applicant testified
that  he  called  the  parking  authority  and  paid  $462  to  resolve  all  of  his  outstanding
tickets. He provided documentation corroborating his payment.10
SOR ¶ 1.e is for Applicant’s Chapter 7 bankruptcy filed in 2008 and discharged in
2009. He listed liabilities totaling $25,692. Applicant testified that he was advised to file
bankruptcy  because  of  his  inability  to  pay  around  $25,000  in  medical  bills  that  he
incurred after a 2001 car accident. He acknowledged that he included a personal loan
and another car loan in his bankruptcy.11
Applicant testified that he does not have any other delinquent debts. He indicated
that  he  consolidated  $25,000  in  student  loans,  which  he  was  paying  at  $300  monthly.
His May 2018 credit reports reflect that he has two student loans in collection for $1,001
and $1,404, respectively. He testified that he received financial counseling as part of his
2008 bankruptcy, and his church pastor was also assisting him with getting his finances
together. He indicated that he and his wife enrolled with a credit-counseling company in
May 2018. He intended to clean up his credit report, to include $1,500 in charges that
he incurred in 2010 when his identity was stolen, though he received reimbursement by
his bank for such unauthorized charges.12
Applicant  indicated  that  he  and  his  wife  manage  their  finances  together.  He
provided  a  copy  of  their  monthly  budget,  reflecting  a  monthly  net  remainder  of
approximately $1,500, which can vary depending on changes to their expenses that can
occur during certain times in the year. He testified that while they are able to meet their
monthly expenses, at times they are overextended by around $500. He testified that he
has  a  401k  retirement  savings  account  of  around  $600,  and  he  believes  his  wife  also
has  such  an  account  though  he  did  not  know  the  balance.  He  testified  that  he  has
always  received  favorable  ratings  on  his  performance  evaluations.  He  provided
documentation to show that he received numerous certificates of appreciation from his
employers  over  the  years.  His  current  annual  income  is  approximately  $60,000,  from
$18,000 in 2001, which included a recent pay raise.13
