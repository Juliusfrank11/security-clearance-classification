Applicant is 54 years old. He graduated from high school in 2004, and had some
college, but no degree. He retired after serving honorably in the U.S. Army from 1984 –
2005.  He  has  been  employed  intermittently  as  a  federal  contractor  since  November
2006, most recently as a functional analyst stationed overseas. He reported a period of
unemployment  from  January  2015  to  December  2015.  Applicant  reported  a  previous
security clearance from DOD in September 2001. Applicant married in September 1983
and  divorced  in  1992.  He  married  again  in  1995,  and  he  has  a  16-year-old  son,  and
three adult stepchildren.
Applicant reported his failure to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years
(TYs)  2011-2014  in  section  26  of his  security  clearance  application  (SCA).2  There,  he
stated his intention to hire a tax return preparation agency to file the delinquent income
tax returns, and he claimed the matter was resolved in January 2016. In his Answer to
the SOR on October 23, 2017, Applicant admitted the allegation of failure to timely file
income tax returns at SOR ¶ 1.a. He also admitted the alleged delinquent debts placed
for  collection  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  -1.d,  and  the  charged-off  debt  for  $1,400  at  SOR  ¶  1.e.
Applicant claims that he learned he was overdue on filing his federal income tax returns
during his personal security interview (PSI) in August 2016.3 He stated his intention to
resolve the matter as soon as possible.
Attached to his October 2017 Answer to the SOR, were two checks made out to
the  U.S.  Treasury  on  Applicant’s  account  in  the  amounts  of  $3,324  and  $1,928.  Both
checks  were  dated  July  7,  2017.  Presumably,  this  was  for  back  taxes  owed,  plus
penalties  and  fees  to  the  IRS,  because  Applicant  stated  his  intent  to  file  all  overdue
returns  and  resolve  all  tax  issues  with  the  IRS  no  later  than  June  30,  2017.4  He
provided no explanation why he was unable to file his federal income tax returns timely
in  the  first  place.  He  produced  no  documentary  evidence  to  show  that  he  followed
through  and  actually  filed  the  tax  returns  or  entered  into  any  repayment  arrangement
with the IRS except for the two checks.
The  single  debt  in  the  amount  of  $605  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  was  for  a  utility
account that was opened in December 2011 and the last activity was in March 2015 on
this  account.5  Applicant  claims  to  have  paid  it  off  in  his  answer  but  he  provided  no
substantiation. Similarly, he stated that the energy company debt placed for collection at
1  Unless  stated  otherwise,  the  source  of  the  information  in  this  section  is  Applicant’s  January  21,  2016
security clearance application (SCA) (Item 3), or his personal security interview (PSI) on August 18, 2016.

5 Item 6.
SOR ¶ 1.d, and the charged-off account at SOR ¶ 1.e, were paid off to the best of his
knowledge. Yet, he provided no documentation to confirm payments. The debt for $470
placed for collection by a bank at SOR ¶1.c, was for a credit card account. Applicant’s
February 2016 credit bureau report reflects that it was opened in December 2014, and
the last activity on the account was in January 2016. (Item 6) It remains delinquent.
Applicant  provided  no  response  to  the  FORM  or  evidence  that  he  received
financial counseling. He provided no budget showing income against expenses, or other
documentation to show progress on his delinquent debts. He professed his intentions to
file his overdue income tax returns and repay his delinquent debts in his SCA in January
2016,  and  in  his  PSI  in  August  2016.  He  produced  no  documentary  evidence  that  he
has done so.
