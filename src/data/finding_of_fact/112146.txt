when  she  travels  there.  The  combined  balance  on  both  accounts  was  $2,000  USD  at
the  time  of  her  October  2017  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  and  it  was  $1,020
USD  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing.  Her  husband  has  a  bank  account  in  India  that  his
parents use to pay for their medical and daily living expenses. He also uses it to pay for
his expenses when he travels to India. Its balance at the time of her SCA was $28,000
USD,  and  it  was  $24,000  USD  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing.  Applicant’s  husband
intends  to  close  his  bank  account  in  India  when  he  no  longer  needs  it  to  pay  for  his
parents’  expenses.  He  also  owns  one  property  in  India.  He  purchased  it  for
approximately  $12,000  USD  in  1999,  before  he  and  Applicant  were  married,  for  his
parents to live. Its value as of the date of the hearing was $50,000 USD. Applicant and
her husband intend to sell this property when his parents no longer need to live in it, and
invest the money from the sale in the United States.9

future to live, as their life is in the United States. She also testified that they are loyal to

and their retirement and investment accounts.10

her  or  her  family  in  India  to  the  proper  authorities.  Prior  to  holding  her  current  public
trust position, she was a homemaker from 2001 through 2009. She then worked in the
public  school  system  for  several  years  from  2009  to  2016.  She  is  involved  in  her
community, to include serving as her children’s Girl Scouts treasurer.11

India
India  and  seven  other  countries  were  identified,  in  a  2008  Annual  Report  to
Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, as being involved
in  economic  and  industrial  espionage.  In  its  2009  to  2011  Report  to  Congress,  the
Office  of  the  National  Counterintelligence  Executive  reported  that  sensitive  U.S.
economic information and technology are targeted by the intelligence services, private
sector, and citizens of dozens of countries, to include U.S. allies and its partners. The
U.S.  Department  of  Justice  identified  numerous  criminal  cases  concerning  export
enforcement  related  to  proprietary  defense  information,  economic  espionage,  theft  of
trade  secrets,  and  embargo-related  criminal  prosecutions  involving  both  the  Indian
government as well as private companies and individuals in India.
Anti-Western  terrorist  groups,  including  some  on  the  U.S.  Government’s  list  of
foreign terrorist organizations, are active in India, and the DOS warns U.S. citizens that
India  continues  to  experience  terrorist  and  insurgent  activities  that  may  affect  U.S.
citizens  directly  or  indirectly.  The  South  Asian  Terrorism  Portal,  run  by  the  nonprofit
Institute for Conflict Management, reported fatalities during the first half of 2017 due to
terrorism and insurgency in India.
India  continues  to  experience  significant  human  rights  abuses.  In  its  2018
annual human rights report for India, the DOS identified the following as India’s most
significant  human  rights  problems:  police  and  security  force  abuses;  widespread
corruption; reports of political prisoners in certain states; instances of censorship and
harassment  of  media  outlets  including  some  critical  of  the  government;  and  a  lack  of
accountability  for  misconduct  at  all  levels  of  government,  contributing  to  widespread
impunity.
The  Central  Monitoring  System  (CMS)  in  India,  a  mass  electronic  surveillance
data-mining  program  installed  by  a  government-owned  center,  continued  to  allow
governmental  agencies  to  monitor  electronic  communication  in  real  time  without
informing  the  subject  or  a  judge.    The  CMS  also  provides  agencies  with  centralized
access  to  the  telecommunications  network,  the  ability  to  hear  and  record  mobile,
landline,  satellite,  and  Voice  over  Internet  Protocol  phone  calls,  read  private  e-mails
and text messages, and track geographical locations of people in real time.
