The  SOR  alleges  a  Chapter  bankruptcy  discharge  in  2001,  and  a  Chapter  13
discharge  in  February  2010.  The  SOR  also  alleges  21  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately  $67,472,  of  which  $58,700  is  student  loan  debt.  Applicant  admitted  the
bankruptcies  under  the  financial  considerations  guideline.  She  admitted  SOR  1.c
through 1.i; she denied the medical accounts at SOR 1.j through 1n; and she admitted
SOR  1.o  through  1.w,  with  explanations.  The  delinquent  debts  include  a  rental
judgment,  a  car  insurance  judgment,  two  department  of  education  loans,  two  cable
debts, two phone debts, five medical debts, a utility debt, four parking tickets, and a pest
control debt.
Applicant  is  44  years  old  and  divorced.  She  has  two  adult-aged  daughters,  25
and  24  years old.  After high  school,  she  received  several  computer certifications.  She
has  worked  for  defense  contractors  from  2008  to  2018.  Since  March  2018,  she  has
been  employed  by  a  contractor  in  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act  (FOIA)  office  of  a
Federal agency. In her job, she processes document requests for time sensitive delivery

2011;  October  to  December  2011;  and  August  to  November  2012.  Applicant  believed
her  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  2001  was  caused  periods  of  unemployment  resulting  in
bills  before  2001.  She  also  recalled  that  she  had  a  car  repossessed  before  the
bankruptcy.  The  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  that  she  successfully  discharged  in  February
2010,  was  caused  by  working  on  contracts  that  expired  and  looking  for  new
employment. (G1 at 12-18; Tr. 9-10, 45-46)
SOR 1.c – The Government documentation shows that the judgment was filed in
April  2011,  after  Applicant’s  February  2010  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  discharge.  In  her
November 2017 answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed that she disputed the judgment.
During  her  testimony,  she  indicated  she  spoke  with  the  landlord  and  paid  the  debt  in
2010.  Upon  further  questioning  about  the  reason  for  the  debt,  she  indicated  that  she
had  medical  surgery  and  had  to  take  short-term  disability  and  did  not  get  paid.  She
intended to check her paperwork to determine when she paid the judgment. (GE 4 at 5;
Tr. 34, 48) The debt is unresolved.
SOR  1.d  –  Government  documentation  indicates  that  a  judgment  was  filed
against Applicant in 2015. In her answer, Applicant claimed that she paid the judgment
and submitted AE B and AE G to establish that the judgment was paid. Even though the
insurer’s  name  does not  appear in either exhibit.  In  October 2017,  the  author  of AE B
instructed her to pay the $628 balance and the judgment and suspension and judgment
would be removed. In February 2018, the state motor vehicle agency advised her that
judgment  and  suspension  was  removed  based  on  the  agencies  receipt  of  an  order  of
satisfaction. (AE B, AE G; Tr. 51-53) The allegation is resolved for Applicant.
SOR  1.e,  1.f  –  the  two  allegations  represent  student  loans  for  Applicant’s  two
daughters. Government documentation shows that the loans became delinquent in April
2015 and were no longer in forbearance as on June and July 2018. Applicant cosigned
for  both  loans,  but  did  not  realize  that  she  was  liable  as  cosigner  if  her  daughters
defaulted  on  the  loans.  Applicant’s  post-hearing  documentation  reflects  that  the  loans
have been restored to forbearance, are in grace, or in repayment. (GE 2; AE C, AE D,
AE K, AE L; Tr. 34-36, 53-6)
