SOR  allegation  ¶¶  1.b,  1.c,  1.g,  and  1.h  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  50-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  pages  5
and 9.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since April of 2016. (GX 1 at
page 9.) He is “separated” from his spouse; and has three son’s ages “20, 12 and 10,”
The two youngest live with Applicant. (TR at page 18 line 16 to page 24 line 3, and GX
1  at  page  14.)  Applicant  served  in  the  U.S.  Navy  for  “16  or  17  years,”  but  family
concerns  and  a  personnel  “draw  down”  caused  Applicant  to  leave  active  duty.  (TR  at
page 18 line 16 to page 24 line 3.)
Guideline F – Financial Considerations
1.a.  Applicant  admits  that  he  is  indebted  to  Creditor  A  for  a  past-due  debt  of
about  $544.  He  has  engaged  the  services  of  a  debt  counseling  service;  and  through
that  service,  he  is making  monthly  payments  of  $197  towards  this  and  his  other past-
due debts. (TR at page 24 line 8 to page 25 line 11, at page 33 line 3 to page 35 line 16,
AppX C, and AppX D at page 1.)
1.b.  Applicant  denies  that  he  is  indebted  to  Creditor  B  for  a  past-due  debt  of
about  $250.  He  believes  this  debt  is  actually  owed  by  his  eldest  son;  but  in  an
abundance  of  caution,  he  is  making  monthly  payments  of  $197  towards  this  debt  and
his other past-due debts. (TR at page 25 line 13 to page 26 line 18, at page 35 line 17
to page 36 line 10, and AppX D at page 1.)
1.c.  Applicant  denies  that  he  is  indebted  to  Creditor  C  for  a  past-due  debt  of
about $60. He has “no idea what this is”; but in an abundance of caution, he is making
monthly payments of $197 towards this debt and his other past-due debts. (TR at page
26 line 20 to page 27 line 3, at page 36 lines 11~15, and AppX D at page 1.)
1.d.  Applicant  admits  that  he  owed  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  a  past-
due tax lien in the amended amount of $290. (TR at page 27 line 24 to page 32 line 18,
at  page  36  line  17  to  page  37  line  12,  and  AppX  D  at  pages  2~3.)  He  has  been  in
contact with the IRS (AppX B); and has “PAID” the amended amount, as evidenced by
documentation from the IRS (AppX D at pages 2~3).
1.e.  Applicant  admits  that  he  owed  the  IRS  a  second  past-due  tax  lien  in  the
original amount of $16,928. (TR at page 27 line 24 to page 32 line 18, at page 36 line
17 to page 37 line 12, and AppX D at pages 2~3.) He has been in contact with the IRS
(AppX  B);  and  the  amount  owed  has  yet  to  be  determined,  as  evidenced  by
documentation from the IRS (AppX D at pages 2~3).
1.f. Applicant admits that he owed IRS a third past-due tax lien in the amended
amount of $364. (TR at page 27 line 24 to page 32 line 18, at page 36 line 17 to page
37 line 12, and AppX D at pages 2~3.) He has been in contact with the IRS (AppX B);
and  has  “PAID”  the  amended  amount,  as  evidenced  by  documentation  from  the  IRS
(AppX D at pages 2~3).

about $53. He does not “recall owing them anything”; but in an abundance of caution,
he is making monthly payments of $197 towards this debt and his other past-due debts.

(TR at page 27 lines 21~23, at page 37 lines 15~24, and AppX D at page 1.)
