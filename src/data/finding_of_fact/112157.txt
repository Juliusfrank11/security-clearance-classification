In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d-
1.f, 2.a, and 2.b. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c.  His admissions are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  45-year-old  mechanic  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since
February 2008. He has held a security clearance since September 2008. He worked at
an  automobile  dealership  from  December 1998  to  October  2007,  when  the  dealership
went out of business. He was unemployed from October 2007 until he began his current
job.
Applicant  married  in  October  2000  and  divorced  in  February  2007.  He  has  two
children, ages 18 and 15, and he shares custody with his ex-wife. He was paying child
support  for  both  children  until  recently.  He  is  no  longer  paying  child  support  or  his
daughter, now that she is 18 years old. (AX A.) His child support payments are current.
Applicant filed a  petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy  in  June 2002  and  received  a
discharge  in  September  2002.  (FORM  Item  7.)  The  record  does  not  reflect  the
circumstances of this bankruptcy, and it is not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant  filed  another  petition  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  January  2017  and
received  a  discharge  in  April  2017.  (FORM  Item  8.)  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he
attributed this bankruptcy to a back injury in November 2013, back surgery in January
2014, uninsured medical expenses, and unspecified legal issues in 2015.
When Applicant submitted his SCA in December 2015, he disclosed that he had
failed  to  file  municipal  income  tax  returns  and  pay  the  taxes  due  for  2013  and  2014,
estimated  at  about  $400  for  each  year.  In  response  to  DOHA  interrogatories,  he
explained that his delinquent municipal taxes were incurred because he moved from a
municipality without taxes and was unaware that his new place of residence was subject
to municipal taxes. He submitted a statement reflecting that he owed $740 in municipal
income taxes for 2013 and 2014. (FORM Item 6 at 40.) The taxes have not been paid.
IRS tax transcripts reflect that Applicant’s 2013 return was filed late on May 12,
2014, and there is no indication that an extension of time was granted for this return. A
six-month  extension  of  time  to  file  was  granted  for  the  2014  return,  and  it  was  filed  in
November 2015, about a month after the due date. A six-month extension of time to file
was  granted  for  the  2015  return,  and  it  was  filed  on  December  5,  2016,  about  two
months after the due date. The 2016 return was filed late on May 29, 2017, and there is
no indication that an extension was granted for this return. (FORM Item 6 at 34-39.)
IRS  income  tax  transcripts  reflect  that  Applicant  owed  $452  for  2013,  $797  for
2015, and $502 for 2016. IRS transcripts reflect that his refund for 2014 was applied to
his  tax  debt.  The  transcripts  also  reflect  that  he  made  a  payment  agreement  in
September  2014  and  made  11  payments  of  $25  between  March  2015  and  October
2016. (FORM Item 6 at 31-39.). He submitted a copy of his federal income tax return for
2017  reflecting  an  anticipated  refund  of  $904.  (FORM  Item  3.)  Applicant  has  filed  his
federal income tax return for 2018 and expects a refund, which he will use to pay debts.
(AX A.)
In  Applicant’s  response  to  the  FORM,  he  stated  that  during  the  recent  federal
government  five-week  shutdown,  he  used  all  his  savings  to  stay  current  on  his  living
expenses,  and  he  is  just  now  starting  to  recover  from  his  loss  of  pay.  He  is  living
paycheck to paycheck. (AX A.) I have taken administrative notice, without objection by
Department  Counsel,  that  the  federal  government  was  shut  down  from  December  22,
2018  to  January  26,  2019,  during  which  time  many  employees  of  federal  contractors
were furloughed without pay.
Applicant  disclosed  in  his  SCA  that  he  was  charged  with  driving  under  the
influence (DUI) in July 1996. He was convicted, fined, lost his driver’s license for a year,
and  was  required  to  take  a  three-day  alcohol  education  class.  (FORM  Item  4  at  31.)
This incident was not alleged in the SOR.
In  February  2013,  Applicant  was  cited  for  public  intoxication  and  disorderly
conduct. (FORM Item 15.) In his SCA, Applicant stated that this incident occurred when
he  was  leaving  a  bar,  knocked  over  a  free-standing  sign,  and  was  confronted  by  a
security guard who swore at him and ordered him to pick up the sign. Applicant stated
that  he  responded  to  the  security  guard  in  the  same  hostile  and  profane  manner.  He
admitted the incident in his answer to the SOR. He paid a fine online. (FORM Item 3 at
2.)
In  April  2015,  Applicant  and  his  children  were  visiting  at  a  friend’s  home.
Applicant and his friend were both drinking heavily. Applicant and his then 14-year-old
daughter began arguing. He slipped and fell, and his daughter ridiculed him. He slapped
his daughter and grabbed her after she continued to make disrespectful comments and
kicked  him.  Someone  not  identified  in  the  record  called  the  police.  Applicant  was
sleeping on a sofa when the police arrived. According to the police report, Applicant was
so intoxicated that the police needed to hold him upright to handcuff him. He was held in
jail on an “intoxication watch” for six hours. (FORM Item 14 at 4.) He was charged with
domestic violence and endangering a child. He self-reported the incident to his security
manager. (FORM Item 3 at 2; FORM Item 4 at 29; FORM Item 5.) He hired an attorney
and demanded a jury trial. A few days before the trial, he accepted a plea bargain and
pleaded  guilty  to  unlawful  restraint.  He  was  sentenced  in  August  2015  to  a  $200  fine
plus  court  costs.  He  was  placed  on  probation  for  two  years,  required  to  complete  a
domestic-violence-awareness class, abstain from alcohol, attend Alcoholics Anonymous
(AA) meetings, and meet with a probation officer once a month. (FORM Item 5.)
Applicant  underwent  an  alcohol  assessment  in  June  2016  as  part  of  his
probation. The results of the assessment were reported to the court, but Applicant was
not  informed  of  them  He  did  not  receive  any  alcohol-related  treatment  or  receive  a
diagnosis  or  prognosis.  (FORM  Item  6  at  15.)  He  was  released  from  probation  early,
after completing one year.
When  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in  January  2017,  he
told the investigator that his alcohol use had never affected his work performance, but
that it had adversely affected his professional and personal relationships. He abstained
from  alcohol from  April 2015 to  September 2016,  because  it  was  a  requirement  of his
probation.  He  described  himself  as  a  social  drinker  who  has  two  or  three  glasses  of
wine in the evening on weekends. (FORM Item 6 at 15-16.)
