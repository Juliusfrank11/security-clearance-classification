corporation1 doing business as a defense contractor. He has been the primary owner of
the  company  since  2002.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  military  from  1989  until  he  was
honorably  discharged  in  1991.  He  seeks  to  retain  a  security  clearance,  which  he  has
held  for  many  years.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree,  which  was  awarded  in  1994,  and  a
master’s  degree,  which  he  earned  in  1995.  He  is  married,  but  separated.  He  has  four
adult children.2
Applicant sold a division of his company in 2011. With the profit from the sale and
his other income, his adjusted  gross income for federal tax purposes was $5,942,002.
His  tax  liability  was  $1,013,836.  The  IRS  reported  that  $36,068  was  withheld  from  his
pay;  $72,836  was  credited  from  a  previous  tax  period;  $200,000  was  paid  in  October
2012;  and  the  federal  income  tax  return  was  filed  in  December  2012.  Applicant  paid
another $200,000 in April 2013; $480 in October 2014; and $8,882 in October 2015. His
tax refunds for 2013 and 2014 were withheld, and $1,021 and $26,542 were transferred
to his 2011 tax debt in April 2015. The IRS issued a notice of intent to levy in November
2014.  As  of  June  2017,  with  penalties  and  interest,  his  tax  liability  for  2011  was
$705,014. As of July 2018, it had increased to $724,332.3
Applicant  also  owes  the  IRS  for  tax  year  2012,  when  he  received  the  final
payment  for  the  sale  of  the  division  of  his  company.  His  adjusted  gross  income  was
$267,151.  The  IRS  reported  that  he  was  credited  with  $2,000  and  $862  in  April  2013,
but the IRS records do not indicate any other payments. His federal income tax return
was filed in February 2015. As of June 2017, with penalties and interest, his tax liability
for 2012 was $58,728. As of July 2018, it had increased to $60,757.4
Applicant stated that he had little choice but to sell the division of his company to
a large company in 2011, as the large company would have taken their business away if
he  had  not  sold.  The  loss  of  the  profitable  division  adversely  affected  Applicant’s
company  financially.  He  stated  that  his  accountant  advised  him  to  pay  the  IRS
$200,000,  and  that  he  would  be  able  to  receive  credits  from  losses  that  would  permit
him to offset the taxes.5
1  S  corporations  are  corporations  that  elect  to  pass  corporate  income,  losses,  deductions,  and  credits
through  to  their  shareholders  for  federal  tax  purposes.  Shareholders  of  S  corporations  report  the  flow-
through  of  income  and  losses  on  their  personal  tax  returns  and  are  assessed  tax  at  their  individual
income  tax  rates.  This  allows  S  corporations  to  avoid  double  taxation  on  the  corporate  income.  S
corporations  are  responsible  for  tax  on  certain  built-in  gains  and  passive  income  at  the  entity  level.

Applicant was unable to offset the taxes for 2011 and 2012. He stated that he put
much of the money that he received from the sale of the division back into the company.
He  used  about  $1.6  million  from  the  sale  to  pay  the  mortgage  loan  on  his  house.  He
also paid credit cards and car loans, and he put about $200,000 away for his children’s
college education.6
When  he  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
September  2015,  Applicant  wrote  that  he  was  “[i]n  process  of  putting  payment  plan  in
place with IRS.” In July 2017, he responded to DOD interrogatories and wrote that his
accountants contacted the IRS to establish an installment agreement, but his case was
awaiting assignment to a local IRS collection office. He wrote that “[o]nce the accounts
are  assigned,  we  will  continue  working  with  the  IRS  to  establish  an  installment
agreement.”  He  testified  that  his  tax  experts  worked  with  the  IRS  for  a  payment  plan,
but one was never reached. He stated that he was unaware that he could pay the IRS
outside  of  an  established  payment  plan.  Applicant  stated  that  his  company  is  doing
better  financially  and  has  been  awarded  several  contracts.  He  plans  to  pay  his  back
taxes from the additional profits generated by his company.7
While  his  company  was  struggling,  Applicant  took  on  personal  debt,  and  he
personally guaranteed debt in order for his company to receive credit. A past-due credit
card with a $38,688 balance was closed by the creditor and transferred to a collection
company (SOR ¶ 1.c). A creditor obtained a judgment of $685,000 against Applicant’s
company and Applicant personally in July 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.f). Another creditor obtained a
judgment of $399,363 against Applicant and his company in July 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.g).8
Applicant  entered  into  a  payment  agreement  with  the  collection  company
handling  the  $38,688  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.c.  He  agreed  to  pay  $403  per  month  for  96
months. He made the first payment under the plan on October 1, 2018.9
Applicant and his company entered into a confidential settlement agreement with
the  creditor  holding  the  $685,000  judgment  in  SOR  ¶  1.f,  and  the  judgment  was
vacated. Applicant’s company agreed to pay $20,000 per week until $479,000 was paid
to  the  creditor.  Applicant  documented  that  from  July  2018  to  September  2018,  the
company made the ten $20,000 payments required under the settlement agreement.10
Applicant  and  his  company  settled  the  $399,363  judgment  in  SOR  ¶  1.g.  They
paid $109,898 to complete the settlement in June 2018.11
