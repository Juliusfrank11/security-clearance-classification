The  Appeal  Board  noted  that  the  2013  Federal  tax  transcript  submitted  by
Applicant contained the following entries near the top of the page:
RETURN DUE DATE OR RETURN RECEIVED DATE (WHICHEVER IS LATER) Apr. 15, 2014
May 12, 2014
PROCESSING DATE
However, the transcript also contained the following entries further down on the page:
CODE  EXPLANATION OF TRANSACTION
150
Tax return filed
CYCLE
2014705
DATE
5-12-2014
AMOUNT
$5,798
The apparent conflict between the first line, reflecting that the return was received on or
before April 15, 2014,  and  the  last  line,  reflecting  that  the  return was  filed  on  May  12,
2014, was the basis for the Appeal Board’s decision to remand the case.
Without objection from either party, I have taken administrative notice of the portion
of Section 8A of the IRS Master File Codes pertaining to Transaction Code 150, which
was cited in footnote 2 of the Appeal Board decision. The relevant portion of the Master
File Codes is attached to the record. (Remand Exhibit V.)
In  my  original decision,  I  interpreted  the  second  “tax  return filed” entry  near the
bottom of the page, below the reference to Code 150, as the actual date of filing. However,
my review of the Master File Codes has convinced me that the entry on the first line is the
date on which the return was due or received, whichever is later, and the second entry
under Code 150 is the date on which the tax return was processed and the amount of tax
due  was  determined. Accordingly,  I  have  reconsidered and  revised  my findings of fact
pertaining to the dates on which Applicant filed his federal tax returns for 2013 through
2016.
My original findings of fact regarding Applicant’s tax filings are set out below:
IRS tax transcripts reflect that Applicant’s 2013 return was filed late on May
12, 2014, and there is no indication that an extension of time was granted
for this return. A six-month extension of time to file was granted for the 2014
return, and it was filed in November 2015, about a month after the due date.
A six-month extension of time to file was granted for the 2015 return, and it
was filed on December 5, 2016, about two months after the due date. The
2016 return was filed late on May 29, 2017, and there is no indication that
an extension was granted for this return. (FORM Item 6 at 34-39.)
I have reconsidered the above findings of fact after reviewing the IRS Master File
Codes pertaining to Transaction Code 150. My revised findings of fact on reconsideration,
in place of the above paragraph, are as follows:
The tax transcripts for 2013 reflect that Applicant timely filed his return on
April  15,  2014;  that  he  had  a  six-month  extension  for  2014  and  filed  his
return  on  October  19,  2015,  four  days  late;  that  he  had  a  six-month
extension for 2015 and filed his return on October 17, 2016, two days late;
and that he timely filed his 2016 return on April 15, 2017.
I  adhere  to  and  incorporate  by  reference  the  remaining  findings  of  fact  in  my
original decision, including the findings regarding Applicant’s two Chapter 7 bankruptcies,
his tax debts, and the findings of fact regarding the allegations under Guideline G.
