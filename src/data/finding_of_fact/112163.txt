In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all of the factual
allegations  pertaining  to  criminal  conduct  in  the  SOR  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  through  1.d.).
Applicant  did  not admit  or deny  the  allegations  pertaining  to  personal conduct  (SOR ¶
2.a.),  so  a  denial  was  registered  as  to  that  allegation.  Applicant’s  admissions  and
comments  are  incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  complete  and  thorough
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the
following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a solution-delivery designer with his current employer since April 2016. He completed
his high school education through the General Educational Development (GED) Program
in 1987. He also earned some college credits, but no degree. Applicant enlisted in the
Army National Guard in February 1987, and he remained with the National Guard until he
was  transferred  to  the  U.S.  Army  Reserve  in  October  1987.  In  August  1988,  after
receiving administrative disciplinary punishment by written counseling or under Article 15,
Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) on three separate occasions for (1) “bouncing”
several checks, (2) having long hair, and (3) being under the influence of alcohol, he was
administratively  discharged  and  issued  an  uncharacterized  discharge  while  training.
Applicant was granted a confidential clearance in 1988, and he held a secret clearance
from 2007 until 2008. Applicant was married in 1993 and separated in 2011. He has been
cohabiting since April 2013. He has two children, born in 1996 and 1999.
Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct
Applicant’s relationship with his wife has been rather toxic and volatile. He noted
that  his  wife  has  mental-health  issues,  and  that  she  has  been  hospitalized  and
institutionalized on several occasions. Because of a variety of issues created by his wife’s
erratic behavior, and her refusal to take her medication, Applicant and his wife have been
involved in a series of incidents that have escalated to alleged mutual domestic violence,
as well as police and court interventions:
(SOR ¶.1.a.): In September 2006, Applicant sustained a head injury because of a
motorcycle accident, and the result was equilibrium problems and extreme dizziness that
left him temporarily unable to stand up.  On November 26, 2006, he and his wife were
arguing about reasons he could not recall. Applicant’s wife ordered him out of the house
and started kicking and pushing him, and even attempted to push him down the stairs.
He did not strike her, but he did grab her as he was falling. She eventually went outside
to  talk on  the telephone,  and  when  she  did, Applicant  locked the  door behind  her and
called the sheriff. The sheriff interviewed both parties, and issued citations for harassment
to both Applicant and his wife. Applicant was permitted to remain in the house with his
son that night, while his wife was persuaded to leave with her father and brother.1 The
following  day,  she  returned  home  while  he  was  packing  for  a  job  interview  in  another
state. Once again, an argument ensued, and again it involved her kicking and pushing
Applicant. He did not strike her. When she went outside to talk on the telephone, Applicant
again  locked  the  door  and  called  the  sheriff.  The  sheriff  remained  in  the  residence  to
enable Applicant to complete his packing and leave. Neither party was arrested.2
As  a  result  of  the  harassment  citations,  Applicant  and  his  wife  were  offered
accelerated rehabilitative disposition (ARD), a special pre-trial intervention program in the
state for non-violent offenders with no prior or limited record. The primary purpose of the
program  is  the  rehabilitation  of  the  offender  and  secondarily  the  prompt  disposition  of
charges,  eliminating  the  need  for  costly  and  time-consuming  trials  or  other  court
proceedings. They both successfully completed the program on December 19, 2006.3
(SOR ¶.1.b.): On November 27, 2006, the date of the second incident, Applicant’s
wife  filed  an  emergency  protection  from  abuse  order  (PFA)  -  a  civil  order  of  the  court
available to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking, that prohibits the
offender from abusing, stalking, harassing, threatening or attempting to use physical force
that would reasonably cause bodily injury to the victim – following the advice of a woman’s
support  group,  claiming  Applicant  beat  their  children.4  Applicant  offered  two  separate

accounts  regarding  the  PFA,  initially  claiming  that  he  was  unaware  of  it,  but  later
acknowledging that it was served on him. He was told not to have contact with his wife.
Several months later, during a period of reconciliation, Applicant and his wife were seen
together, and someone not identified reported the PFA violation to the sheriff. On March
29, 2007, the sheriff came to the family residence and arrested Applicant for contempt for
violating the PFA. Unable to obtain $10,000 bail, Applicant remained in jail until April 5,
2007.5 Applicant’s wife made several attempts to have the PFA  rescinded, and on that
date, the district attorney’s motion to withdraw the violation was granted and the matter
was dismissed.6
In April 2013, Applicant went to visit his sons for a week and work on the mediation
papers  for  an  amicable  divorce.  Somehow,  Applicant’s  wife  obtained  control  of  his
telephone and found text messages from his at that point, future cohabitant. She became
enraged  and  they  got  into  an  argument.  She  tore  up  the  divorce  paperwork.  She  also
attempted to remove the clothing he had in his vehicle and tried to take the vehicle. They
struggled  at  the  doorway  to  the  vehicle.  Applicant  called  the  police  who  arrived  and
observed her screaming and yelling, and attempting to throw his belongings out of the
vehicle. No one was arrested, and Applicant returned home without further incident.7
(SOR ¶.1.c.): On June 24, 2013, Applicant’s wife filed a criminal complaint against
him  for  grabbing  her  arm  and  pushing  her.  When  the  police  arrived,  they  interviewed
Applicant’s  wife  and  children.  She  claimed  that  Applicant  grabbed  her  arm  during  a
confrontation  identical  to  the  one  that  occurred  in  April  2013.  The  two  sons  –  then
approximately  17  and  14  years  of  age  –  denied  that  Applicant  touched  her.  She  then
requested  a  person  the  police  described  as  her  “friend,”  but  actually  her  brother,  to
confirm that Applicant grabbed her arm while she was removing items from the vehicle
that  her brother had  “doctored” so  the  engine  would not  start.  A warrant  of  arrest  was
issued, and Applicant’s wife obtained her own  warrant. She also filed a request for an
emergency protective order – family abuse (EPO).8 The following day, while attending a

discussed by the DOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess
an  applicant's  credibility;  (b)  to  evaluate  an  applicant's  evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed
circumstances;  (c)  to  consider  whether  an  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful  rehabilitation;  (d)  to
decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence
for whole-person analysis under Directive § 6.3.).  See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26,

Applicant’s unalleged EPO will be considered only for the five purposes listed above.
custody hearing at the family courthouse, Applicant was arrested for assault and battery
against a family or household member, a class 1 misdemeanor. After spending several
hours  in  jail,  he  was  released  and  allowed  to  return  to  his  out-of-state  home  until  the
eventual hearing date.9 On September 26, 2013, after hearing the conflicting testimony
from the police officers, Applicant’s wife, and her brother, the charges were nolle prossed,
and the EPO was dismissed, with the judge admonishing Applicant’s wife for abusing the
system.10 Applicant contends that  his wife leverages the system, and that  the charges
and  EPO  were  intended  to  prevent  him  from  visiting  his  children  and  recovering  his
personal property.
Applicant’s relationship with his cohabitant – now referred to as his fiancée - has
also  been  at  times  somewhat  volatile.  She  has  had  anger  and  psychiatric  issues  that
required  medication,  and  because  of  those  issues,  they  have  separated  periodically.
However,  now  that  she  is  back  on  her  medication,  her  issues  have  been  successfully
modified.11
(SOR ¶.1.d.): Applicant and his fiancée reunited in February 2017, after a three-
month separation, and they were still having difficulties over their relationship. On April
22, 2017, although Applicant tried holding her hand to stop her from doing more harm,
she  pushed  and  struck  him,  and  slammed  his  wrist  in  the  door.  Applicant  pushed  her
away. At one point during their disagreement, she went outside and threw a hatchet at
the  house,  putting  a  hole  in  the  house.12  Applicant  called  the  police.  When  the  police
arrived, Applicant’s wrist was treated with an ice pack and wrap, and both Applicant and
his  fiancée  were  interviewed.  Applicant’s  fiancée  acknowledged  having  anger  issues,
leading  to  violent  outbursts,  and  denied  that  Applicant  struck  her.  Nevertheless,  both
Applicant and his fiancée were arrested and charged with domestic violence, 3rd degree.13
On October 2, 2017, the court found Applicant not guilty of the charge and dismissed the
charge nolle prossed. All records pertaining to the charge were ordered expunged and
destroyed.14

13 GE 2 (Order for Destruction of Arrest Records, dated November 3, 2017); Applicant’s Answer to
the SOR, supra note 10. Domestic Violence, 3rd degree is the lowest of the degrees in the state. It is illegal
to cause physical harm or injury to another “household member” as defined under the law, or to offer or
attempt to cause physical harm or injury to a household member with apparent present ability to reasonably
create imminent fear a misdemeanor and will receive of fine of between $1,000 and $2,000, jailed up to 90
days or both. Although the statute was previously modified to allow the officer freedom to decide if an arrest
should in fact be made, most officers take the position that they must still make an arrest to remove one
person from the dispute to prevent or minimize potential or further injury.
