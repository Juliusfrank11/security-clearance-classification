Applicant  is  43  years  old  and  has  worked  as  an  assembly-line  mechanic  for  a
defense contractor since February 2015. He was married from 2000 until he divorced in
2002, and he has two adult sons from that relationship. Applicant also has full custody of
his minor daughter from another relationship. Applicant has attended some college. (Item
3; Item 6; Response)
Applicant  experienced  problems  related  to  custody  issues.  Until  approximately
2003 or 2004, Applicant and his ex-wife shared joint custody of  their two sons, and he
paid her $640 a month in child support. At that time, she abandoned their children with
Applicant. As a result of the ensuing custody battle, Applicant received full custody of their
children, and his ex-wife was ordered to pay $264 in monthly support. Applicant’s arrears
were forgiven, because his ex-wife did not make her child-support payments. (Item 6 at
6-8; AE 1; AE 3)
Applicant’s daughter was born in 2004. He was unaware that he had a daughter
until 2006 when his daughter’s mother notified him. At that time, he was approximately
$6,000 in arrears for child support, and he was required to pay $406 a month, plus $204
for arrears. In 2008, he obtained full custody of his daughter, and the court held that any
arrears that existed at that time were waived. (Item 6 at 8-9; AE 2)
Applicant also experienced medical issues that negatively affected his finances. In
2007,  Applicant  was  in  an  automobile  accident  and  broke  both  of  his  legs.  He  was
unemployed  from  January  2010  to  February  2015.  During  this  period,  he  took  classes
and cared for ill family members and his children. He was supported by his parents and
state aid. In June 2016, Applicant started to experience seizures and took a  22-month
medical leave of absence from his employer. He was paid approximately 50% of his salary
for six months and was unpaid for the next sixteen months. He returned to work in April
2018. (Item 3 at 11; Item 6 at 2, 3, 12-14; Response; AE 6; AE 7)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  has  twenty  delinquent  debts,  totaling  almost
$25,000. The debts became delinquent between approximately 2010 and 2016 when he
was unemployed. (Item 4; Item 5; Item 6) Applicant admitted to all of the alleged debts in
his  Answer,  with  no  explanation.  In  his  Response,  he  claimed  most  of  the  debts  were
resolved. To support his claim that many of the non-student loan debts were resolved, he
provided three credit bureau reports (CBR). Many of the older debts no longer appear in
the 2018 CBRs. (AE 4)
SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  1.c,  1.d,  and  1.h  are  five  government  student  loan  accounts
totaling $13,158. They were opened between 2010 and 2012, and they were assigned
for government collection in 2016. In his May 2015 SCA, Applicant indicated that he was
working to resolve his student loans, and they were all deferred until June 2017. During
his October 2016 personal subject interview (PSI), Applicant told the investigator that his
loans were still deferred and might be forgiven. (Item 4 at 1-2; Item 6 at 14-16)
The alleged delinquent student loan debts appear in a CBR dated August 30, 2017.
(Item 4) Applicant submitted credit bureau reports (CBR) from each of the credit bureaus,
all of which were dated June 12, 2018. (AE 4) In these CBRs, Applicant appears to have
more than five student loans, and the student loans alleged in the SOR remain delinquent.
There are several additional student loans that appear as deferred by two companies that
service  both  private  and  federal  student  loans.  Applicant  submitted  a  letter  dated
December 2018, from one of these companies. The letter indicated that all of Applicant’s
loans in “Group G” are in forbearance status until March 2019. It is unclear from the letter
which of his alleged student loans are included in the forbearance program. The letter
does not list the loans or the amounts placed in forbearance.1  Additionally, the account
numbers and balances listed in Item 4 are inconsistent  with the  account numbers and
balances listed in AE 4. It is unclear from the record evidence how many student loans
Applicant has and which are deferred or are in forbearance. (Item 4; AE 4; AE 8)
SOR  ¶¶  1.e,  1.f,  1.g,  1.i,  1.j,  1.k,  1.m,  1.n,  1.o,  1.p,  1.q,  1.r,  1.s,  and  1.t  are  all
delinquent medical debts totaling $11,175. They became delinquent between 2011 and
2014. SOR ¶ 1.l is a $117 delinquent phone account. (Item 4; Item 5)
1 The December 2018 letter submitted by Applicant lists only one account. His counsel submitted an email
claiming  all  of  the  delinquent  student  loans  are  included  in  forbearance,  but  did  not  provide  detailed
documentation to support his assertions. (AE 8; HE I)
In Applicant’s Response, he claimed that only three of the alleged non-student loan
debts remain unpaid (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.i). The three debts appear as delinquent in
AE 4, and their combined current outstanding balance is $1,252. (Item 4; Item 5; Equifax
at 32-33; Transunion at 13; Experian at 2) Applicant did not provide proof of payment or
resolution of the other alleged non-student loan debts. His counsel stated that debts are
removed by credit agencies when they are paid. However, debts may no longer appear
on  credit  reports  for  a  variety  of  reasons:  the  debt  may  be  beyond  the  seven-year
reporting  period;  the  creditor  has  taken  a  loss  on  the  debt;  a  new  creditor  may  have
purchased the debt; or the debt was paid.
Applicant  submitted  a  pay  stub  and  a  budget  worksheet.  According  to  the
documentation, his income exceeds his monthly expenses. (AE 5) He also submitted 11
letters of recommendation from family members and others who have worked with him
and  known  him  for  many  years.  Several  of  these  individuals  hold  or  have  held  DOD
security clearances. They describe Applicant as trustworthy, reliable, honest, responsible,
dependable, and ambitious. (AE 7)
