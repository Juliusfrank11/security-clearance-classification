In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through
1.f.  (HE  3)  She  also  provided  mitigating  information.  Her  admissions  are  accepted  as

At  the  time  of  her  hearing,  Applicant  was  a  59-year-old  specialist  in  conducting

graduated  from  high  school.  (Tr.  5)  She  has  about  two  years  of  college.  (Tr.  6)  She
married  the  same  man  twice,  in  1977  and  1984,  and  they  were  divorced  in  1983  and
1993. (Tr. 6) She married in 2005 and divorced in 2010. (Tr. 6) Her children are ages 37
and 40. (Tr. 6) She adopted her three-year-old granddaughter in 2006, and Applicant had

Financial Considerations
Applicant received federal civil service retirement pay after July 2014. (Tr. 23-24)
She had a period of unemployment from July 2015 to February 2016. (Tr. 22) In 2014,
she withdrew $64,000 from her Thrift Savings Account, which increased her tax liability
in 2014. (Tr. 24) The status of the financial issues alleged in the SOR at the time of her
hearing were as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns for
tax years 2013 through 2015. For tax year 2013, Applicant said she thought that she filed
her tax return about one week after her extension expired. (Tr. 30) The Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) advised her in 2017, that the IRS had not received her tax return for tax
year 2013. (Tr. 50) The IRS recalculated her tax return, and she did not owe any taxes
for tax year 2013. She was supposed to receive a refund; however, since her 2013 tax
return was more than three years overdue, the IRS refused to credit her with the refund.
Applicant said she did not timely file her tax returns because she was distracted by issues
involving  her  grandchild  and  children.  (Tr.  31)  Her  son  and  daughter-in-law  are  drug
addicts; her son was incarcerated; and her grandchild was severely injured. (Tr. 31-32)
Her son is not currently incarcerated; however, her daughter is now in jail. (Tr. 33) She
described the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI)
as “a kick in the rear” to motivate her to file her federal income tax returns. (Tr. 34)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  that  Applicant  owes  delinquent  federal  income  taxes  for  tax
years  2013  through  2016.  Applicant  admitted  that  she  has  a  debt  for  unpaid  federal
income taxes. (Tr. 34) Applicant provided tax transcripts for tax years 2013 through 2016,
and information from those tax transcripts (GE 2) is depicted in the following table:

estimated that she owes about $12,500 in total to the IRS. (Tr. 51; January 24, 2018 IRS
letter) In February 2018, Applicant started making payments in compliance with her $384
monthly payment plan to the IRS. (Tr. 35) Up to the date of her hearing, she had made
all of her scheduled payments. (Tr. 35-38)
SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.d  allege  a  charged-off  debt for $1,434 and  a  debt placed for
collection for $1,272 owed to the same creditor. On February 8, 2018, the creditor wrote
thanking Applicant for payment of $315 and stating the current balance owed is $1,141.
(Tr. 19) She conceded she “blew them off” and failed to make payments for several years.
(Tr. 41) At the time of her hearing, she planned to continue to make payments until the
debt is resolved. (Tr. 41)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  a  charged-off  bank  debt  for  $508.  In  her  SOR  response,
Applicant said she intended to make two $254 payments in March 2018. At her hearing,
she conceded that she did not get around to making the payments to resolve this debt.
(Tr. 41-42)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a debt owed to Applicant’s landlord for $4,223 which was placed
for collection. On November 15, 2009, Applicant signed a one-year lease in which she
agreed to pay $1,985 monthly for an apartment. (Tr. 19-20) She said she disputed her
responsibility  for  this  debt.  (SOR  response)  She  did  not  provide  a  copy  of  the
correspondence disputing the debt.
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges a utility debt placed for collection for $123. Applicant said the
creditor agreed she did not owe the debt because it was paid in June 2015. (Tr. 42; SOR
response) She asked the creditor to provide updated information to the credit reporting
companies.  (Tr. 42) The debt  does  not  appear as  delinquent  on her February  2, 2018
TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian credit reports. (SOR response)
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges Applicant owes a past-due amount of $294 on a debt for $5,104.
Her  SOR  response  indicated  the  balance  owed  is  $4,326,  and  the  account  is  current.
Applicant’s  February  2,  2018  credit  reports  indicate  the  balance  is  $4,479,  and  her
payment is 30 days past due in the amount of $92. (February 2, 2018 TransUnion credit
report at 29; February 2, 2018 Equifax credit report at 24; Experian credit report at 29)
Applicant said her payments on this credit card debt are current. (Tr. 42-43)
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges Applicant is past due $343 on a debt for $5,003. The debt relates
to Applicant’s 2005 vehicle. (Tr. 43) In December 2017, shortly after her son was released
from jail, he wrecked Applicant’s vehicle; it did not have insurance; and it is in Applicant’s
garage. (Tr. 43-46) The account is now $964 past due. (Tr. 43) At her hearing, she said
she planned to pay off the debt. (Tr. 44)
On  March  21,  2018,  Applicant  paid  a  debt  for  $16,829  originally  owed  to  a
motorcycle  company.  (Tr.  20,  28) With  employer  matching,  she  is  contributing  $1,600
monthly into a retirement plan. (Tr. 38)
