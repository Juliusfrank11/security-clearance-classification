Applicant  is  a  55-year-old  senior  systems  engineer,  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since 2013. He worked for previous defense contractors since about 2003. He
graduated from high school in 1981. He married in 1984 and divorced in 1986. He married
again  in  2010,  and  has  one  adult  child.  Applicant  has  held  a  security  clearance  since
2003.
The SOR alleges under Guideline F, that  Applicant failed to file Federal income
tax returns for tax years 2005-2009 and 2011. The SOR also alleges under Guideline E,
that Applicant failed to disclose that his 2008 and 2009 tax returns were not filed when he
completed his 2015 SCA. Applicant admitted the Guideline F allegation with explanations,
and denied the Guideline E allegation, stating that he did not deliberately fail to disclose
the information. The Guideline F SOR allegation is supported by substantial evidence,
but the Guideline E allegation is unfounded.
Applicant reported in his SCA, that he worked as a civilian contractor in Iraq from
2005 to 2010 in support of U.S. Armed Forces. He left Iraq in March 2010, and remained
unemployed until he began working in Afghanistan in November 2010 to March 2011.3
He worked in Macedonia from March 2011 to February 2012, when he returned to the
United States. Applicant was required to file Federal income tax returns,4 however while
in a combat zone or contingency operation area under IRS rules,5 he received automatic
extensions  to  file  Federal  tax  returns  until  the  expiration  of  180  days  after  leaving  the
combat zone or contingency operation area.6
After  leaving  the  combat  zone  area  in  2011,  Applicant  did  not  file  his  Federal
income tax returns for the tax years while deployed, because of distractions caused by
searching for a new job, arranging the immigration needs for his foreign-born spouse, and
3 Applicant testified that he worked in Iraq and Afghanistan continuously from 2003 to 2011.

of the Armed Forces serving in a combat zone or a contingency operation.

moving his family to two different states within six months. After he filed his 2012 Federal
tax return on time in April 2013, he stated that the IRS notified him about his unfiled tax
returns. He maintained continuous contact with the IRS thereafter and filed the returns he
was  instructed  to  file.  He  stated  that  he  was  instructed  over  the  phone  on  several
occasions, to file his 2010 tax return, which he signed on January 6, 2013, and received
by the IRS on June 18, 2013, but was instructed not to file the remaining unfiled returns
(2005 to 2009 and 2011). He indicated that the IRS was applying a three-year look-back
period for any refunds owed to the taxpayer, and a six-year look-back period for any taxes
owed to the IRS.
Internal Revenue Service tax transcripts in evidence show the following:

In August 2014, Applicant received an IRS notice of a balance of $8,555 was due
for tax year 2010. He filed a petition in 2015 in the United States Tax Court challenging
the deficiency amount. In May 2015, Applicant and the IRS settled the case with a ruling
that no deficiency or additional tax was due for tax year 2010.  Applicant agreed  to pay
the $3,376 balance owed, which he paid in July 2017. The tax year 2010 transcript shows
a zero balance.
Tax  returns  for  tax  years  2012  to  2017  were  filed  on  time  and  no  tax  is  owed.
Applicant re-contacted the IRS by phone after the hearing, and confirmed that he was in
full compliance with IRS instructions, and that they did not require him to file any of the
unfiled  tax  returns.  The  IRS  representatives  contacted  would  not  provide  a  written
confirmation.
When  Applicant  completed  his  2015  SCA,  he  was  asked  in  section  26,  to  list
whether “in the past seven years, have you failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other
taxes when required by law or ordinance?” He responded “yes,” and stated that he failed
to file his 2009 return:
“due  to  working  overseas  in  a  war  zone,  I  was  not  required  to  file  until
permanent return to the states from working in said war zone. I had not filed
in a timely manner for several of those years, but have been working with
the IRS to get all returns filed. 2009 is the only one outstanding at this time,
though we are still working through 2010 at present.”
In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  stated  that  2008  tax  return  was  not  listed
because he did correctly count back seven years, rather he thought 2009 was the first
year to report. Also, since the IRS told him he did not have to file the 2011 return, he did
not think to list it as a failure to file a tax return. He acknowledged these errors, but noted
that he listed 2009, which was pending at the time, and did not intentionally or willfully fail
to list his 2008 and 2011 tax returns.
Applicant is financially stable. He and his spouse earn over $112,000 per year and
reported  a  monthly  net  remainder  of  over  $2,000  after  paying  expenses.  He  has  no
delinquent debt, a paid mortgage, and about $76,000 in other assets.
Law and Policies
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484  U.S.  518, 528  (1988). As  Commander in  Chief,  the President  has  the  authority  to
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is  clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An
administrative  judge  must  consider  a  person’s  stability,  trustworthiness,  reliability,
discretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG ¶ 1(b).
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the
possible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant
has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the  President  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  have
established for issuing a clearance.
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the
personal or professional history  of  the applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant from
being  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information.  The  Government  has  the  burden  of
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. “Substantial
evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. Washington
Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a
nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the  criteria  listed
therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3
(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015).
Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG ¶ 1(d).
