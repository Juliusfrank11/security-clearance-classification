The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  owed  approximately  $54,000  in  past-due
indebtedness to various creditors. Applicant denied owing the debt in SOR allegation 1.c.
Applicant partially admitted and partially denied the remaining allegations. The existence
and  amount  of  the  debts  is  supported  by  admissions  of  Applicant,  and  credit  reports
submitted by the Government dated October 6, 2015; and August 24, 2017. (Government
Exhibits  4  and  3.)  Applicant  submitted  credit  reports  dated  November  16,  2017;
November  25,  2017;  and  two  different  reports  each  dated  April  12,  2018.  (Applicant
Exhibits K, B, P, and Q.)
Applicant was married to his first wife from 1988 through 2013. From 2010 to 2012
Applicant was stationed in a combat zone, and was making a substantial monthly income.
He believed his wife was taking care of the family finances, but she was not. He had to
pay this wife substantial spousal support after their divorce, because of his income at that
time. This began his financial difficulties. Applicant was able to reduce his spousal support
to a more manageable amount in July 2017. (Tr. 24-30; Applicant Exhibits F and G.)
Applicant moved to Germany in 2012, and married his second wife in August 2014.
His  wife  and  her  son  moved  to  Germany,  but  she  did  not  work  there.  (Tr.  31,  35;
Government Exhibit 1 at Section 17.)
Applicant was stricken with a case of bacterial meningitis in March 2015. He was
hospitalized for over a month, and was in a coma for approximately three weeks. He was
off work for approximately three months. During that time he was only earning 65% of his
normal  pay.  This  increased  his  already  serious  financial  issues.  (Tr.  32-38,  67-71;
Applicant Exhibit L.)
Applicant  returned  to  the  United  States  in  December  2016.  He  began  trying  to
resolve his past-due indebtedness starting in 2017. (Tr. 73-77.)
The current status of the debts is as follows:
1.a. Applicant admitted that he owed approximately $12,970 to a credit union for a
charged-off  debt.  SOR  allegations  1.b  and  1.d  relate  to  different  debts  with  the  same
credit union. He reached a payment agreement with this credit union in August 2017, and
has been consistently making monthly payments in accordance with this agreement, as
is  shown  by  documents  from  the  credit  union.  This  debt  is  being  resolved.  (Applicant
Exhibits N and U; Tr. 38-42, 77-83.)
1.b. Applicant admitted that he owed $11,579 to a credit union for a charged-off
debt. He reached a payment agreement with this credit union in August 2017, and has
been  consistently  making  monthly  payments  in  accordance  with  this  agreement,  as  is
shown  by  documents  from  the  credit  union.  This  debt  is  being  resolved.  (Applicant
Exhibits N and U; Tr. 38-42, 77-83.)
1.c. Applicant denied that he owed $10,215 for a charged-off debt on a department
store credit card. Applicant disputed this debt, stating that  the account belonged to his
mother. Applicant further stated that he was an authorized user on the account, but he
did not incur the debts. Records from the creditor confirm that Applicant’s mother is the
account holder. Applicant’s mother submitted a notarized letter stating that Applicant was
not responsible for the debt. Finally, Applicant has disputed the debt in writing with the
creditor.  Based  on  the  available  information,  I  find  that  insufficient  evidence  has  been
submitted to show that this is actually Applicant’s debt. It is in dispute. (Applicant Exhibits
BB, CC, and DD; Tr. 49-55, 83-85.)
1.d.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  owed  $8,085  to  a  credit  union  for  a  charged-off
debt. He reached a payment agreement with this credit union in August 2017, and has
been consistently making monthly payments in accordance with this agreement as shown
by documents from the credit union. This debt is being resolved. (Applicant Exhibits N
and U; Tr. 38-42, 77-83.)
1.e. Applicant admitted that he owed another credit union $777 for a charged-off
debt. He submitted documentary evidence showing that he paid this debt in full. It has
been resolved. (Applicant Exhibits J, P at 25, Q at 44-46; Tr. 42-45.)
1.f. Applicant admitted owing a delinquent medical bill in the amount of $376. He
has paid this debt in full, as shown by documentation from the creditor’s collection agent.
This debt is resolved. (Government Exhibit 15 at 3; Applicant Exhibit H at 4-5; Tr. 45-46.)
1.g.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  owed  $10,914  for  a  charged-off  personal  loan.
Applicant  made  a  payment  arrangement  with  the  creditor’s  collection  agent,  and
submitted  documentation  from  the  collection  agent  that  showed  he  has  been  in
compliance with that arrangement. This debt is being resolved. (Applicant Exhibits H, M,
W, and X; Tr. 46-49.)
Applicant’s current financial situation is stable. His wife is employed, and they are
able  to  pay  their  current  indebtedness  with  no  trouble.  Applicant  has  taken  credit
counseling courses. He also submitted documentation showing that he is current on other
formerly  delinquent  accounts  not  discussed  in  the  SOR.  Applicant  understands  the
importance of resolving his past-due debts and remaining fiscally secure into the future.
(Applicant Exhibits C, D, T, V, Y, Z, and AA; Tr. 55-64, 85-87.)
Mitigation
Applicant provided nine letters of recommendation from people who know him in
the defense industry, both military members and civilians. He is described as a man of
character, a person who is trustworthy, and a valued professional. They all recommend
him for a position of trust. (Applicant Exhibits A and R.)
Applicant served in the Air Force from 1992 to 2001. He received an Honorable
Discharge at the end of his military service. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 15.)
