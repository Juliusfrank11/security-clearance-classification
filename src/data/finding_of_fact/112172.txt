After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 44-year-old high school graduate who has worked as a uniformed
protection  officer  for  his  employer,  a  defense  contractor, since  October 2016.  He  was
employed as a county correctional officer from March 1997 to August 2016. Applicant and
his spouse have been married since July 2000, and they have three children, ages 16, 14,
and 9. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 79.) Their children have some medical issues. (Tr. 72.)
Applicant and his spouse purchased their current residence in July 2006, acquiring
an adjustable-rate mortgage loan for $256,500. Applicant recalls that the initial mortgage
payments were only $1,300 a month. (GE 3; Tr. 88-90.) In May 2007, they obtained a
second mortgage for $24,496 (SOR ¶ 1.a) to pay for household repairs and appliances.
(GEs 2-3; AE R; Tr. 89.) In October 2007, the monthly obligation on their primary mortgage
increased from $2,028 to $2,694. (AE O.) Applicant was unable to refinance for a fixed-rate
mortgage at that time because his home was worth less than the mortgage debt. (Tr. 92.)
In the fall of 2008, their mortgage payment decreased to $2,512. (AE O.) Applicant and his
spouse struggled to make that mortgage payment. At times, they relied on the credit cards
in SOR ¶ 1.c and ¶ 1.d to cover some of their mortgage payment. (Tr. 94-95, 109.)
Over the next few years, Applicant and his spouse were late in paying some bills.
They  stopping  paying  on  some accounts, including their second mortgage. In January
2010, they obtained a car loan for $14,736. They were chronically late, from 30 to 90 days,
in making their $297 car payment. Applicant worked overtime when he could, and he held
a second job as a security guard at a high school 16 hours a week from July 2012 to June
2014, but they still struggled to pay their bills. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 96.)
Applicant  was  recognized  for  his  professionalism  and  teamwork  as  a  county
correctional officer, including in April 2016. (AE I.) However, he went 12 years without a
raise, and earned only $21 an hour after 20 years on the job. (Tr. 80, 96.) In August 2016,
he lost his job after he submitted an inaccurate claim for hours worked, which he maintains
was due to a clerical error. (GE 2; Tr. 68.) While unemployed and without health insurance,
Applicant incurred out-of-pocket prescription costs of $630 in September 2016 for his son.
(Tr. 84-87.)
Applicant had “probably $80,000” in his retirement contributions disbursed to him
when he was terminated from his job as a corrections officer. (Tr. 117, 120.) Within six
months, he spent $40,000 to $41,000 of the funds on cars for himself and his spouse. (Tr.
120-121.)  The  remainder  went  to  catch  up  on  their  primary  mortgage  and  other  living
expenses, including electric and gas debts of approximately $2,000 each. They were so
delinquent on their gas bill that the meter was removed from their house, and the company
would not accept installment payments. (Tr. 121-123.)
In  mid-October 2016,  Applicant  was  hired  by  his current  employer,  pending the
government’s approval of his assignment to its contract with the company. (GE 2.) He was
sent for one month of training in another state. He was advised to bring proof of citizenship,
a  valid  social  security  card,  and  valid  photo  identification  acceptable  for  federal
identification. He was not told to bring all the information that he might need to complete an
accurate  e-QIP. (AE D.) He was advised that no controlled substances could  be used
during the training, so he discontinued his prescription medications for his attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  (AE X; Tr. 72.)
Applicant reported for training on October 24, 2016. The next day, he was advised
that  he  needed  to  complete  an  e-QIP,  and  he  received  an  email  with  the  information
needed to access the form electronically. (AE D.) Applicant expressed some concern to
another trainee that he did not have the information available to accurately complete the
form. He was instructed to do the best that he could. He felt stressed and unprepared to
complete the task, but he completed the form in the hotel lobby that night. (AE X; Tr. 63-
64.)  He  responded  negatively  to  the  e-QIP’s  financial  record  inquiries  concerning
delinquency involving routine accounts, including whether he had any bills or debts turned
over to a collection agency in the last seven years and whether he had any account or
credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled in the last seven years for failing to pay as
agreed. (GE 1.)
A check of Applicant’s credit in late January 2017 showed charged-off balances of
$24,496 on his second mortgage and $5,752, $5,698, and $4,108 on three consumer-
credit accounts. Some smaller debts were reportedly in collection. A car loan obtained in
January 2010 was $692 past due on a $720 balance. (GE 3.) Applicant denies that he had
any intention to conceal his financial delinquencies, citing the lack of notice and information
available at the time to complete the form accurately. The training classmate, to whom
Applicant  had  confided  his  concerns  about  the  form,  indicates  that  Applicant  lacked
adequate time and opportunity to complete the form. (AE G.)
On May 17, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  When  asked  about  any  financial  issues,  he
responded “Yes” to whether he had a credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled and
to being over 120 days delinquent on a credit card because of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b. He
explained that he fell behind on the debt when his mortgage payment increased and that
he had no success in working out a payment plan with the credit lender. He asserted that
he paid down the debt to $3,500 through a collection entity. Applicant denied that he had
any additional delinquencies or financial problems. He was then confronted about the other
debts on his credit record.1 He recognized the credit card debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d and
his student loan, which he maintained was deferred. He did not recognize the medical
collection debts, and explained that his spouse handles the bills. Applicant explained that
he had not previously disclosed the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d due to error; the student
loan because it was deferred; and the credit-card debt in SOR ¶ 1.c because he was only
an authorized user on his spouse’s account. Regarding his second mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.a),
Applicant denied there was any problem because he combined it with his primary mortgage
when he refinanced. Applicant described his financial situation as good in that he was
paying his bills on time. He attributed the delinquencies to the financial strain caused by the
increase  in  his  monthly  mortgage  obligation.  Applicant  expressed  his  intention  to
investigate the adverse credit information on his record and pay his debts. (GE 2.)
On May 25, 2017, Applicant was re-interviewed to provide documentation about his
financial accounts, which showed that the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.c had obtained a financial
judgment  against  his spouse.  The  court  determined  on  April 6, 2017, that she had no
present ability to repay the $5,843 balance. He provided documentation showing that Trans
Union had deleted the mortgage debt (SOR ¶ 1.a) from his credit report. He asserted to the
investigator that the debt was paid. He presented documentation showing that he had
requested a financial hardship deferment of his federal student loan on February 16. 2017,
and asserted that it was not delinquent. Applicant had requests pending with Trans Union
to report the status of the account in SOR ¶ 1.b as closed and to verify the balance of the
credit-card account in SOR ¶ 1.d. Regarding the medical collection accounts, Applicant
explained  that  his spouse  paid  their  medical  bills.  Applicant  expressed his intention to
inquire about the accounts discussed and pay them. (GE 2.)
Available evidence reflects the following delinquency and payment histories for the
SOR debts:
Charged-off mortgage loan for $24,496 (SOR ¶ 1.a)
Applicant and his spouse’s second mortgage has been delinquent since May 2010.
(AE R.)  Their account was charged off for $28,019 in February 2011, but they then made
monthly  payments  from  $200  to  $250  through  July  2012.  A  last  payment  of  $100  in
September 2012 reduced the balance to $24,496. (GE 3; AE E.) Applicant indicated during
his May 2017 interview with the OPM investigator that he made monthly payments of $225
on  the  loan  until  approximately  2008,  when  he  combined  the  debt  with  his  primary
mortgage  in  a  refinancing.  Around  2011,  Applicant  noticed  the  charged-off  second
mortgage on his credit report and disputed the debt. (GE 2.) Trans Union removed the
credit  entry  with  the  original  lender  from  his  credit  profile  in  February  2013.  (AE  E.)
Available evidence shows that the debt had been transferred, so it is likely that the original
lender could not verify the debt.
As of January 2017, the creditor now holding the debt (SOR ¶ 1.a) was reporting a
charged-off balance of $24,496. (GE 3.) In May 2017, Applicant told the OPM investigator
1 Applicant testified that he did not recall some debts until they were brought up by the investigator. (Tr. 78.)
that he contacted the creditor, who billed him for the debt, and  that he was advised to
submit loan documents proving the debt was either paid or combined with his primary
mortgage. He told the investigator that he intended to send  the loan documents to the
creditor. (GE 2.) The creditor billed him every month, including in September 2017 (AE R),
for  the  principal  balance  of  $24,496  on  the  loan.  (Tr.  100.)  In  late  November  2017,
Applicant disputed the debt with the creditor. (AE R.) The creditor proved to him that it
legitimately held the debt, so Applicant is no longer disputing it. (Tr. 55-56; 99.) Sometime
during the second week of May 2018, Applicant applied to his primary mortgage lender to
modify his loan to include this debt. Action on his application is pending an appraisal on his
home. If he is denied, he intends to repay the charged-off second mortgage at $150 a
month. (Tr. 56-58, 101.)
Charged-off credit account for $5,572 (SOR ¶ 1.b)
Applicant  and  his  spouse  opened  a  joint  credit  account  in  August  2008  with  a
$5,000 credit limit for dental work. (GE 3; Tr. 102-103.) He paid on the debt until July 2011,
and in October 2011, the creditor charged off the account for $5,752. As of January 2017,
all three credit reporting agencies were reporting a balance of $5,752 ($969 past due). (GE
3.) He indicated during his May 2017 subject interview that, after being contacted by a
collection entity, he began repaying the debt at $50 to $100 a month. He could not recall
the date on which he began making payments, but he believed the debt had been paid
down from $5,752 to $3,500. (GE 2.) Applicant contacted the creditor after he received the
SOR, but the account had been removed from collections. (Tr. 103-104.) In early January
2018, Applicant and his spouse asked the creditor to contact them about resolving the
debt.  (AE  N.)  As  of  mid-May  2018,  they  were  still  awaiting  repayment  terms  from  the
creditor. (AE H; Tr. 58-59, 103.) Applicant presented no recent credit information that could
corroborate the reduced balance of $3,500. High credit on the account is reported to have
been $3,826.
Charged-off credit card for $5,698 (SOR ¶ 1.c)
Applicant was an authorized user on his spouse’s credit-card account opened in
February 2000. They used the credit card for groceries and medicine. (Tr. 59.) The creditor
charged off a balance of $5,698 because of nonpayment after October 2013. In October
2015, the creditor was awarded a judgment of $5,484 against Applicant’s spouse.  (Tr.
105.) Applicant indicates that they heard nothing further about the debt until January 2017,
when his spouse was summoned to court to answer for nonpayment of the judgment. (AE
Q.) The court determined in April 2017 that his spouse did not  then have the financial
means to pay the debt because she had no income apart from social security disability
income (SSDI). Applicant testified that he initially agreed to make $25 payments on the
debt but did not make those payments. (Tr. 105.) In December 2017, Applicant entered
into an agreement in court to pay the accrued judgment balance of $5,906 for his spouse
at $50 a month starting in mid-January 2018. (AE Q; Tr. 59-60.) Applicant began repaying
the debt in April 2018. He had made two payments as of late May 2018. (Tr. 61, 106.) He
admits that he did not make the payments required from January through March 2018.
When asked for his reason, he responded that he “just didn’t get to pay it.” He then added
that his basement had been flooded with sewage around that time and in late March or
early May 2018, he had water damage in his house from a burst water pipe. (Tr. 107.)
Charged-off credit card for $4,108 (SOR ¶ 1.d)
Applicant and his spouse opened a joint credit-card account in August 2005 with a
$5,000 credit limit. High credit on the account reached $5,066. In March 2014, the creditor
charged off the account for $4,108. As of January 2017, the charged-off balance was still
reported on Applicant’s credit report as an outstanding delinquency. (GE 3.) During his first
interview in May 2017, Applicant asserted that he paid $125 per month on the account until
2009. He lacked current information about the debt, and he indicated that he would look
into  the  debt.  A  week  later,  Applicant  told  the  OPM  investigator that  Trans  Union  was
investigating the debt. (GE 2.) In early January 2018, Applicant and his spouse asked the
creditor to contact them about resolving the debt. (AE M.) Just days before his security-
clearance hearing, Applicant entered into an agreement to repay the debt at $25 monthly.
(AE H; Tr. 61, 108.)
Student loan past due for $173 (SOR ¶ 1.e)
Applicant obtained federal student loans of $8,455 and $727 for college studies that
he  did  not  complete.  (GEs  2-3;  AE  A.)  The  loans  were  consolidated  for  repayment
purposes. He explained in May 2017 that he had made $38 monthly payments until 2009,
when he applied for a deferment. He presented no documentation showing his loan was
deferred, but available credit records suggest that he made no payments between hardship
deferments. His loan was 120 days past due from July 2012 through October 2012, June
2015 through December 2015, and July 2016 through September 2016. (AE S.) As of
December 2016, his account was 90 days past due for $173 on a $10,162 balance. (GE 3.)
His student loan was current in January 2017 but 90 to 120 days late from February to May
2017. (AE S.) In February 2017, Applicant requested a financial hardship deferment, which
he asserts was granted through June 2017. (GE 2.) Documentation shows that he made
$85 monthly payments in August 2017 and September 2017. (AE A.) He testified that he
has continued to make the monthly payment through automatic deduction. (Tr. 62, 109.)
After his January 2018 payment, his student-loan balance was $9,627. (AE S.)
Insurance collection debt for $231 (SOR ¶ 1.f)
In October 2014, an insurance company placed a $231 debt from August 2014 for
collection.  (GE  3.)  Applicant  did  not  recognize  the  debt  during  his  May  2017  subject
interview. (GE 2.) He then contacted the creditor and was told the debt had been paid. (AE
H.) When he answered the SOR, he asserted his account had a zero balance, and the
debt had been removed from his credit. He provided a telephone number for the creditor,
and added that the collection agency would provide a confirmation letter. (Answer.) He
explained at his hearing that he was double billed and so owes no balance. (Tr. 62.)
Medical collection debt for $93 (SOR ¶ 1.g)
In June 2015, a $93 medical debt from May 2012 was placed for collection. (GE 3.)
In May 2017, Applicant told the OPM investigator that he recalled seeing the name of the
collection entity on mail, but he knew nothing about it because his wife handles the bills.
(GE 2.) Applicant paid the debt in mid-October 2017. (AE B.)
Medical collection debt for $38 (SOR ¶ 1.h)
As of January 2017, the credit bureaus were reporting that a $38 medical debt from
July 2011 was placed for collection in August 2012. (GE 3.) Applicant did not recognize the
debt  when  he  was  confronted  about  it  during  his  May  2017  interview  with  the  OPM
investigator. (GE 3.) As of May 2018, he had no success in identifying the creditor. (AE H;
Tr. 62-63, 110-111.) He recently filed a dispute with Credit Karma. (Tr. 111.)
Medical collection debt for $38 (SOR ¶ 1.i)
As of January 2017, the credit bureaus were reporting that a $38 medical debt from
July 2011 was placed for collection in January 2012. (GE 3.) Applicant did not recognize
the debt when he was confronted about it during his May 2017 interview with the OPM
investigator. (GE 3.) As of May 2018, he had no success in identifying the creditor. (AE H;
Tr. 62-63, 110-111.) He recently filed a dispute with Credit Karma. (Tr. 111.)
Medical collection debt for $25 (SOR ¶ 1.j)
In May 2016, a $25 medical debt was placed for collection. (GE 3.) When queried
about the debt by an OPM investigator in October 2017, Applicant recognized the creditor
as a medical billing company and speculated that the debt was from an emergency room
visit  for  his  child.  He  denied  knowing  of  any  collection  activity  for  the  debt.  (GE  2.)
Applicant paid the debt in mid-October 2017. (AEs C, H.)
As  of  January  2018,  Applicant’s  federal  student  loan  and  his  and  his  spouse’s
primary mortgage (balance $238,039) were considered current. Their mortgage had been
seriously delinquent as recently as May 2016, but it was brought up-to-date in June 2016.2
They  modified  their  home  loan  to  lower  the  monthly  mortgage  payments  to  $1,400  a
month. (AE S; Tr. 56, 93-94.)
Applicant earns $28 an hour in his current job. He works three 12-hour shifts a week
and an extra four-hour shift every other week. (Tr. 67-68, 70, 80.) He requires a secret
clearance because it is a condition of his employer’s contract with the government. He
does not access classified documentation and submits that he would be no risk to security.
The job is very important to him and his family because of the income and fewer hours and
less stress than working in corrections. (AE T; Tr. 65-67, 71, 75, 79, 96.) His spouse last
worked outside the home in 2005. She worked as a hair stylist, and developed medical

rate. (Tr. 56.) The file does not indicate the date for the refinancing.
problems that caused her to stop working. In 2006, she began receiving SSDI, which has
been consistent over the years. (Tr. 73-74, 82.) As of May 2018, her SSDI was $1,320 plus
$110 for their children every month. (Tr. 69.) Applicant’s take-home pay averages $1,800
every two weeks. He has worked overtime in the past but had not had any overtime during
the first five months of 2018. Any extra income is used for household bills. (Tr. 70-71, 80-
81.) It took until late winter or early spring 2018 for Applicant to stabilize his finances. (Tr.
86.) He testified, without any corroborating documentation, that he and his spouse have
$1,000 to $1,500 in discretionary income after they pay their monthly expenses, excluding
groceries. When asked what he does with the discretionary income, Applicant responded,
“Now lately, we’ve been fixing this stuff.” (Tr. 112.) Applicant has not taken any vacations
away from home in several years. He takes pride in maintaining his house and backyard.
(Tr. 113.)
Applicant and his spouse owe the IRS approximately $10,000 for tax year 2016
because of the disbursement of his retirement contributions by his previous employer. The
IRS  intercepted  their  tax  refund  for tax  year 2017  and  established  an  installment  plan
under which Applicant and his spouse are required to repay their tax debt at $150 a month.
(Tr. 115-117.) When asked when he made his first payment, Applicant responded, “It’s
gonna [sic] start. . . . So I just paid that, so next month.” (Tr. 119.)
Applicant  presented  a  character  reference  letter  dated  August  2014  from  a
neighbor.  The  neighbor  described  Applicant  as  hardworking,  driven,  and  possessing
integrity. He was dedicated to his family and offered assistance to friends and neighbors on
a  regular  basis  even  while  working  multiple  jobs.  (AE  F.)  In  June  2016,  this  neighbor
reiterated his support for Applicant as a valuable asset to any organization. (AE K.)
Applicant’s cousin attested to Applicant having good moral character and being well
liked among his friends. As evidence of Applicant’s kindness, she cited Applicant’s care for
an ill, elderly neighbor who has no local family to care for him. She described Applicant as
“a stand up guy.” (AE U.)
The evening supervisor at Applicant’s jobsite authored a character reference letter.
He described Applicant as an excellent officer, who is trustworthy and very attentive to his
job duties. (AE V.)
