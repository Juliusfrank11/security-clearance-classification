In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, or admitted in part, with comments,
most of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶
1.a.  through  1.e.,  and  1.i.),  and  both  of  the  factual  allegations  pertaining  to  foreign
influence  in  the  SOR  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a.  and  2.b.).  As  to  the  allegations  that  he  denied,
Applicant  also  furnished  comments.  Applicant’s  admissions  and  comments  are
incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the
evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due  consideration  of  same,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as an information technology force protection specialist since he joined his employer in
January 2019. He was previously an electronics technician with another employer from

3  Administrative  or  official  notice  is  the  appropriate  type  of  notice  used  for  administrative
proceedings. See McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986);
ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct.

administrative notice at ISCR proceedings is to notice facts that are either well known or from government
reports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for
administrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize authoritative information or sources
from the internet. See, e.g. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006) (citing internet sources for numerous
documents).  In  this  instance,  although  Department  Counsel  has  selected  only  certain  pages  of  facts
appearing in the identified publications, I have not limited myself to only those facts, but have considered
the publications in their entirety.
February 2017. Applicant has been employed as a civilian contractor in several countries
in  the  Middle  East  for  over  eight  years,  commencing  in  2010.  The  day  following  the
hearing, he was scheduled to return to the Middle East.  A 2005 high school graduate,
Applicant received a technical degree in weather technology in 2010; and a bachelor of
science in business administration, magna cum laude, in 2017. He enlisted in the U.S. Air
Force in December 2005, and served on active duty until he was honorably discharged
as a senior airman (E-4) in January 2010. He was granted a secret clearance in 2005.
Applicant has never been married, but he began cohabiting with his now-fiancée in July
2012. He has one child, born in 2013.
Military Awards and Decorations
During his period of military service,  Applicant served brief deployments in both
Afghanistan (as a force protection specialist) and Iraq (as a senior weather forecaster).
He was awarded the following awards and decorations: the Air Force Achievement Medal,
the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, the Air Force Good Conduct Medal, the National
Defense Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism
Service Medal, the Air Force Overseas Ribbon Long, the Air Force Expeditionary Service
Ribbon with gold border, the Air Force Longevity Service Ribbon, the Small Arms Expert
Marksmanship Ribbon (Rifle), the Air Force Training Ribbon, and the NATO Medal.4
Financial Considerations5
For  approximately  ten  years,  Applicant  has  supposedly  been  supporting  his
parents – his father had a stroke and a quadruple bypass – with a monthly payment which
he inconsistently quantified as $500, $700, and $1,000.6 It is unclear when Applicant first
started  having  financial  difficulties,  although  he  acknowledged  that  there  was  some
significant adverse impact on his finances as a result of his fiancée’s pregnancy in 2013.
Because  she  was  going  through  pregnancy  alone,  without  any  form  of  family  support,
Applicant was motivated to go to the Philippines to assist her. In addition, since the birth
of his child, Applicant purportedly spent about $15,000 in medical expenses because his
fiancée  did  not  have  medical  insurance.  He  has  also  been  sending  his  fiancée
approximately $1,500 per month in child support, as well as $800 to $1,000 per month for
housing.7 During the hearing, Applicant said the monthly rent for the apartment, in a major

March 19, 2017); and Answer to the SOR, dated January 2, 2018.
6 During the hearing, Applicant quantified the payment as $1,000.  See Tr. at 31-32. However, in
his Schedule I – Current Income of Individual Debtor(s), which was incorporated in his Voluntary Petition
for Bankruptcy, dated August 14, 2013 (GE 5), he listed the payment as $500 and $700. He did not submit
any documentation such as cancelled checks or bank account statements to support his claim that he was
paying any amount to his father.
city,  was  $2,500.8  With  respect  to  the  purported  medical  expenses,  child  support,  or
housing  support,  Applicant  did  not  submit  any  documentation to  support  his  claim  that
such payments had been made.
On  August  14,  2013,  three  months  before  his  child  was  born,  Applicant  filed  a
voluntary Petition for Bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, primarily
to save his residence from foreclosure. He identified $208,460 owed to creditors holding
secured claims (including $8,000 in mortgage arrears); $3,500 owed to creditors holding
unsecured priority claims; and $134,168 owed to creditors holding unsecured nonpriority
claims.9 The child was born in the Philippines through C-section in November 2013, and
because Applicant’s fiancée and child needed extended assistance, he remained in the
Philippines and allowed his employment contract to expire in December 2013. Applicant
continued to draw on his savings and a housing allowance to pay his bills. However, the
combination  of  pregnancy  and  childcare  expenses,  and  a  lack  of  income,  eventually
caused extreme financial hardship for Applicant, and he was unable to comply with the
Bankruptcy Trustee’s payment plan, paying only a net total of $3,795 for attorney’s fees
and Trustee expenses and compensation. No payments were made to any creditors. On
May 1, 2014, the bankruptcy case was dismissed.
When  the  bankruptcy  was  dismissed,  all  of  Applicant’s  delinquent  accounts
returned to an active collection status, but he claimed that he did not have sufficient funds
to address them. One residence was foreclosed in October 2014. In March 2016, when
completing  his  e-QIP,  Applicant  noted  some  financial  issues  such  as  delinquencies,
collections,  or  accounts  being  charged  off,  as  well  as  the  foreclosure.  In  March  2017,
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  an  investigator  from  the  U.S.  Office  of  Personnel
Management  (OPM).  During  that  interview,  Applicant  stated  that  since  his  bankruptcy
dismissal, he engaged  the professional services  of a  law  firm  to negotiate  settlements
and set up payment plans for all of his delinquent debts, with the one exception being the
mortgage lender on the foreclosed residence.10 He failed to submit any documentation to
support his claims that he has an agreement with the law firm; that the firm is to perform
any financial services for him; or that any such prepayment agreements or payments have
been  made.  Applicant  added  that  he  “expects  to  be  in  the  process  of  resolving  [the
delinquent accounts] this month,”11 meaning March 2017.
Nine  months  later,  on  December  4,  2017,  Applicant  enrolled  with  a  credit
counseling  service  to assist  him  in  preparing  a  customized  action  plan, and  a  detailed
budget  analysis,  as  well  as  to  review  options  or  alternatives  regarding  his  debt.  The
program introduced him to several core financial concepts, including prioritizing expenses

in order to set financial goals; and examining spending habits in terms of fixed, variable
and periodic expenses.12
On  September  12,  2018,  Applicant  engaged  the  services  of  a  “credit  repair”
organization  to  require  that  the  credit  reporting  agencies demonstrate  compliance  with
the various laws governing fair, accurate and substantiated consumer credit reporting,13
essentially to challenge the accuracy of his credit reports by disputing the reported status
of  various  listed  accounts.  Applicant  explained  that  they  are  to  dispute  “just  some  old
accounts . . . that should have been taken off. . . .”14 Applicant pays the organization $100
per month for their services, and while various disputes have been filed, Applicant was
unable to articulate any specific reasons to provide a specific reasonable basis to do so.
On  September  21,  2018,  approximately  one  year  after  the  SOR  was  issued,
Applicant  engaged  the  professional  services  of  a  debt  settlement  organization  to
negotiate and secure settlements with his creditors. Under that program, Applicant listed
five creditors with total debts of $121,489 for which settlements and payments are to be
negotiated, and Applicant is to pay the organization $1,834 per month for a period of 53
months. The total estimated cost of the program is $30,372.15
In addition to Applicant’s Chapter 13 Bankruptcy (SOR ¶ 1.i.), the SOR identified
eight delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection, charged off, or foreclosed
as  generally  reflected  by  Applicant’s  April  2016,  August  2017,  or  January  2019  credit
reports. Those  debts,  minus  the foreclosure,  total approximately  $121,161.  Applicant’s
outstanding financial  obligations,  all  of  which  were  placed  for collection,  alleged  in  the
SOR are as follows:
(SOR  ¶  1.a.):  This  is  a  home  mortgage  with  a  high  credit  of  $205,168  and  an
unpaid balance of $193,409 that was foreclosed in October 2014 when the fair market
value of the property was listed as $165,847. A Substitute Form 1099-A, Acquisition or
Abandonment  of  Secured  Property,  was  issued  to  him.16  Without  furnishing  a  reason,
Applicant  disputed  the  account  after  foreclosure.  Since  the  fair  market  value  of  the
property is less than the outstanding balance, it is likely there is a deficiency remaining.
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): This is an unsecured loan with an unpaid balance of $45,369  that
was  charged  off  in  June  2014.  In  October  2018,  one  year  after  the  SOR  was  issued,
Applicant and the creditor agreed to a settlement for $18,148, with one $553 payment to
be made by October 31, 2018, and 17 remaining monthly payments of $1,035 to be made

by  the  end  of  each  succeeding  month  until  March  31,  2020.  Applicant  submitted
documentation  to  reflect  several  continuing  payments  under  the  settlement.17  Without
furnishing a reason, Applicant disputed the account after resolution. The account is in the
process of being resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): This is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $10,323 that
was  charged  off.  While  the  account  is  one  of  those  included  in  his  debt  settlement
organization agreement, Applicant did not offer any evidence to indicate that settlement
negotiations had taken place with the creditor or that any payments had yet been made.
The account is not yet in the process of being resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): This is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $10,791 that
was charged off. In January 2019, 15 months after the SOR was issued, Applicant and
the creditor agreed to a settlement for $4,020, with 12 payments of $335 to be made by
the 15th of each month starting in January 2019 and continuing each succeeding month
until  December  2019.  Applicant  submitted  documentation  to  reflect  only  one  such
payment  under  the  settlement.18  Nevertheless,  the  account  is  in  the  process  of  being
resolved.
(SOR  ¶  1.e.):  This  is  an  unspecified  type  of  account  with  an  unpaid  balance  of
$31,174. While the account is one of those included in his debt settlement organization
agreement, Applicant did not offer any evidence to indicate that settlement negotiations
had taken place with the creditor or that any payments had yet been made. The account
is not yet in the process of being resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.f.): This is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $14,725. In
his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied that he still owed any money on the account,
claiming  that  he  had  paid  it  in  full  in  April  2017.  However,  the  account  to  which  the
settlement referred, according to the creditor, had  a different account number, and the
settlement offer was in the approximate amount of $1,244, a significant difference from
the  original  unpaid  balance.19  Further  confusing  the  situation  was  the  reference  by
Applicant in his Answer to the SOR to another account with a different creditor. In the
absence of some documentation indicating that the settlement was in connection with the
subject SOR account, this account remains unresolved.

(SOR ¶ 1.g.): This is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $6,291. In
April  2017,  Applicant  and  the  creditor  agreed  to  a  full  settlement  for  $2,496,  and  that
payment was received by the creditor in May 2017.20 The account has been resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.h.): This is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $2,488 with
the  same  creditor  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.f.,  above.  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant
denied that he still owed any money on the account, claiming that he had paid it in full in
April  2017.  However,  the  account  to  which  the  settlement  referred,  according  to  the
creditor, had a different account number, and the settlement offer was in the approximate
amount of $1,595, a slight difference from the original unpaid balance.21 Further confusing
the situation was the reference by Applicant in his Answer to the SOR to another account
with a different creditor, referred to in SOR ¶ 1.f. In the absence of some documentation
indicating  that  the  settlement  was  in  connection  with  the  subject  SOR  account,  this
account remains unresolved.
Applicant’s income over the past few years has fluctuated. In August 2013, as part
of his Bankruptcy Petition, Applicant reported his average monthly net income as $6,785
– or generally approximately $80,000 per year; his average monthly expenses as $5,395;
and an average monthly remainder of $1,390.22 Upon obtaining a new position in October
2014,  following  his  period  of  unemployment,  his  new  annual  salary  was  between
$120,000 and $140,000.23 In 2017-18, Applicant’s annual salary was about $111,000,24
and as of two days before the hearing, it increased to $154,000.25
During  the  hearing,  Applicant  submitted  a  Personal  Financial  Statement.  It
indicated that his monthly net salary was $8,386; monthly expenses were $4,700; monthly
debt  payments  were  $1,455;  leaving  a  monthly  remainder  of  $2,231,  available  for
discretionary saving or spending.26 However, considering his newly increased salary, the
information in that Personal Financial Statement was no longer considered accurate, and
another one was solicited. A substitute Personal Financial Statement was submitted after
the hearing. It indicated that his monthly net salary was $8,345; monthly expenses were
$2,480;  monthly  debt  payments  were  $2,145;  leaving  a  monthly  remainder  of  $3,720,
available for discretionary saving or spending.27 Despite his significant delinquent debt

Character References
The Chief, Special Programs Division, Pacific Air Forces, a major, worked closely,
on a daily basis, with Applicant in Iraq for approximately six months. Applicant was timely,
courteous,  and  professional,  in  addition  to  being  a  critical  lynchpin  as  a  member  and
liaison to his team and the U.S. Department of State. Applicant excelled and maintained
integrity  and  honesty  with  all  tasks  at  hand.28  Applicant’s  former  flight  commander,  a
retired captain, characterized him as a highly skilled and motivated young man who has
shown he has the leadership and skill to excel at any task. She had total confidence in
his leadership ability throughout their time together. Applicant’s cool-headed thinking and
overall planning allowed other to see an example of true leadership. His demonstrated
leadership skills lead to the squadron leadership trusting him to represent the squadron
and career field through deployments supporting operations. She noted that Applicant’s
trustworthiness will not disappoint.29 Applicant’s former training manager, a retired master
sergeant, stated that Applicant has proven to be trustworthy and reliable.30 Other former
colleagues who have worked with Applicant in Kuwait and Iraq are equally effusive about
his integrity, trustworthiness, positive attitude, loyalty, and dedication.
Foreign Influence31
Applicant was born in the Philippines. He entered the United States in 1995, and
he derived his U.S. citizenship through his parents when they became naturalized U.S.
citizens in 2002. Applicant’s parents are both Philippine-born residents and citizens of the
United  States.  His  two  brothers  are  also  Philippine-born  residents  and  citizens  of  the
United States. None of Applicant’s family members, identified above, are of any security
interest.
Applicant  met  a  young  lady  in  July  2012  when  he  was  vacationing  in  the
Philippines.  She  was  both  a  resident  and  citizen  of  the  Philippines,  working  as  a  disc
jockey. Over time, Applicant and the young lady developed a close relationship, and she
became  pregnant  and  they  became  engaged.  Applicant’s  fiancée  gave  birth  to  their
daughter  in  the  Philippines  in  2013.32  The  child  acquired  U.S.  citizenship  at  birth  as

Philippines
The  Philippine  Islands  became  a  Spanish  colony  during  the  16th  century,  and  they
were ceded to the United States in 1898 following the Spanish-American War. In 1935 they
became a self-governing commonwealth, and on July 4, 1946, attained independence. The
Philippines  is  a  multiparty,  constitutional  republic  with  a  bicameral  legislature.  Over  the
ensuing years, there have been periods of economic and political stability, and instability, with
several coup attempts, charges of corruption, and impeachment efforts. The United States
closed its last military bases, including Clark Air Base, the largest U.S. air base outside of the
United  States,  in  1992.  The  country  conducted  nationwide  elections  in  May  2016  for  the
presidency, both houses of congress, provincial governors, and local government officials.
Some local elections were delayed for one year. International and national observers viewed
the 2016 elections as generally free and fair but reported that vote buying was widespread
and that dynastic political families continued to monopolize elective offices.
In its most recent annual human rights report, the U.S. Department of State reported
that the most significant human rights issues included: killings by security forces, vigilantes
and others allegedly connected to the government, and by insurgents; torture and abuse of
prisoners and detainees by security forces; often harsh and life threatening prison conditions;
warrantless arrests by security forces and cases of apparent government disregard for legal
rights and due process; political prisoners; killings of and threats against journalists; official
corruption and abuse of power; threats of violence against human rights activists; violence
against women; and forced labor.
Extrajudicial killings have been the chief human rights concern in the country for many
years and, after a sharp rise with the onset of the antidrug campaign in 2016, they continued
in 2017. From January to the end of September 2017, media reports chronicled more than

for the foreign-citizen fiancé(e) of a United States (U.S.)  citizen. The K-1 visa permits the foreign-citizen

arrival. The foreign-citizen will then apply for adjustment of status to a permanent resident (LPR) with the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Because a
fiancé(e) visa permits the holder to immigrate to the U.S. and marry a U.S. citizen shortly after arrival in the
United  States,  the  fiancé(e)  must  meet  some  of  the  requirements  of  an  immigrant  visa.  See

900 fatalities in police operations suspected to be connected with the government’s antidrug
campaign. Police claimed to have begun investigations of all reports of extrajudicial killings.
As of August 2017, police claimed to have resolved 1,889 cases, and 4,373 remained under
investigation.
The Philippine Government investigated a  limited number of reported human rights
abuses, including abuses by its own forces, paramilitaries, and insurgent and terrorist groups.
Concerns about police impunity increased significantly following the sharp increase in police
killings. President Duterte publicly rejected criticism of police killings, but he said authorities
would investigate any actions taken outside the rule of law. Significant concerns persisted
about impunity of civilian national and local government officials and powerful business and
commercial figures.
In  May  2017,  members  of  the  terrorist  Maute  Group,  a  radical  Islamist  group
composed of former Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and supporters of other extremist
organizations  attacked  Marawi  City,  on  the  southern  island  of  Mindanao.  In  response
President  Duterte  declared  martial  law  in  all  of  Mindanao.  The  Armed  Forces  of  the
Philippines  (AFP)  restored  government  control  of  the  city  in  October  2017.  Approximately
360,000 persons were displaced as a result of the crisis.
Conflicts  continued  between  the  government  and  Muslim  separatist,  communist
insurgent,  and  terrorist  groups,  displacing  communities  and  resulting  in  deaths  of  security
force  members  and  civilians.  Terrorist  organizations  engaged  in  kidnappings  for  ransom,
bombings of civilian targets, beheadings, and the use of child soldiers in combat or auxiliary
roles,  and  the  organizations  operated  shadow  governments  in  areas  they  controlled.  The
government called off negotiations with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines, the
political arm of the New People’s Army, in early 2017 after clashes between the armed forces
and  New  People’s  Army  guerilla  fighters  in  violation  of  a  2016  ceasefire.  The  government
resumed peace talks with the MILF.
In the Philippines, the emergence of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)-affiliated
extremist  groups,  persistent  kidnappings  by  the  Abu  Sayyaf  Group  (ASG),  attacks  on
government  forces,  and  bombings,  all  indicated  that  domestic  and  international  terrorism
remained a serious problem. Terrorist acts included criminal activities designed to generate
revenue, such as kidnapping for ransom, extortion, and bombings for hire. However, ASG
fighters on Sulu beheaded two Canadian hostages, one in April and one in June 2016, when
their ransoms were not paid. The two men had been held captive since September 2015.
The  Philippine  Government  recognized  the  threat  posed  by  radicalized  Philippine
citizens supporting ISIS and ISIS supporters traveling to the Philippines to promote violent
extremism in the country or seek safe haven. Members of numerous groups – including parts
of the ASG; the Dawlah Islamiyah Lanao (DIL), commonly referred to as the Maute Group;
and  Ansar-al  Khalifah  Philippines  –  have  pledged  allegiance  to  ISIS.  ISIS  called  on  its
supporters in Southeast Asia to join these groups and attack targets in the Philippines, and
named former ASG leader Isnilon Hapilon as its regional leader.
Philippine  military  and  police  counterterrorism  efforts  kept  up  pressure  on  terrorist
organizations, but were unable to prevent numerous attacks against government, public, and
private facilities, primarily in central and western Mindanao. In November 2016, a bomb was
11
discovered and disarmed near the U.S. Embassy in Manila. In April and May 2017, bombings
in  Quiapo,  Manila  killed  two  and  injured  twenty,  and  conflict  between  terrorist  groups  and
Philippines security forces in Marawi City, Mindanao resulted in hundreds of dead and injured.
In June 2017, security forces rescued at least 60 civilians held hostage by members of the
Islamic militant group Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) after the group launched
an  attack  in  North  Cotabato.  In  August  2017,  suspected  members  of  the  ASG  attacked  a
village  in  Basilan,  killing  at  least  nine  civilians  and  wounding  a  dozen  more.  In  December
2017, an attack on a police station in Misamis Oriental by approximately 100 members of the
New  People’s  Army  (NPA),  which  is  the  armed  winged  of  the  Communist  Party  of  the
Philippines  (CPP),  exemplified  the  group’s  frequent  strikes  at  military,  police,  and  local
government targets.
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  advises  all  U.S.  citizens  contemplating  travel  to  the
Philippines  to  exercise  increased  caution  due  to  crime,  terrorism,  and  civil  unrest.  U.S.
citizens are specifically advised to not travel to Sulu Archipelago, including the southern Sulu
Sea, and Marawi City, and to reconsider travel to Mindanao which remains under a state of
national  emergency.  Terrorist  and  armed  groups  continue  plotting  possible  kidnappings,
bombings, and other attacks in the Philippines. The U.S. Department of State has assessed
Manila as being a high-threat location of crime directed at or affecting official U.S. government
officials.  As  noted  above,  Applicant’s  fiancée  and  daughter  reside  nowhere  near  the
identified areas of unrest and terrorist threats.
