Applicant denied both of the SOR allegations. She is 52 years old. She married
in 1986, divorced in 2009, and remarried in 2015. She has two children, both of whom
are adults.1
Applicant  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2012.  She  has  worked  for  her  current
employer, a defense contractor, since 2017. She previously worked for another defense
contractor  from  2006  through  2017.  She  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  around
2008.2
The  SOR  alleges  two  delinquent  consumer  accounts  totaling  $31,491  (SOR  ¶¶
1.a - 1.b). The allegations are established by an October 2016 credit report. SOR ¶ 1.a
is for a $14,510 charged-off credit card, and SOR ¶ 1.b is for a $16,981 credit card in
collection. Applicant opened both credit cards between 2004 and 2006. She used them
primarily  for  her  tuition  expenses,  as  well  as  for  household  expenses  and  wedding
expenses for her daughter in 2008.3
Applicant  attributed  her  delinquent  debts  to  her  2008  separation  and  2009
divorce. The divorce decree held her responsible for five debts, two of which were the
debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b.  She  went  from  a  two-income  to  a  single-income
household,  at  a  time  when  she  earned  approximately  $40,000  annually.  She  received
spousal  support  for  only  a  few  months  after  the  divorce.  She  did  not  receive  child
support, as both of her children were adults, but she continued to support one child who
lived  with  her  after  the  divorce.  She  was  in  school  part-time  from  2006  through  2012,
and though her then-employer provided tuition reimbursement, it was not at 100%.4
In  2009,  Applicant  closed  all  five  of  her  credit  cards  for  which  she  was  held
responsible,  and  she  retained  the  services  of  a  debt  consolidation  company  to  assist
her with settling them, to include SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b, as she did not have the income
to  pay  her outstanding  debts  in full.  She  chose  to  try  to  resolve  her  outstanding  debts
rather than join her ex-husband’s bankruptcy that he filed in 2009. She testified that she
worked  with  and  made  payments  to  the  debt  consolidation  company  for  three  years,

from  2009  through  2012,  in  an  effort  to  resolve  her  outstanding  debts.  She  indicated
that  the  debt  consolidation  company  successfully  settled  three  of  her  credit  cards,  to
include another credit card that she had with the same creditor in SOR ¶ 1.b. The 2016
credit report corroborates Applicant’s claim that she resolved several other outstanding
debts.5
Applicant testified that the debt consolidation company was unable to settle SOR
¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b. She indicated that the creditor for SOR ¶ 1.a was unwilling to work with
a  third  party  to  settle  the  debt,  and  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  was  charged  off  in  2010
before a settlement could be reached. She did not subsequently attempt to negotiate a
settlement  directly  with  both  creditors  because  when  the  debt  consolidation  company
“called  me and  told  me  .  .  . that they  were not  able  to  settle  those,  I thought  we  were
done.  Since  they  were  not  able  to,  I  didn’t  realize  that  I  might  be  able  to.”  She  also
indicated  that  at  the  time,  her  limited  income  prevented  her  from  paying  both  debts  in
full,  as  she  did  not  receive  a  significant  pay  raise  until  after  she  earned  her  degree  in
2012.6
After  she  received  the  SOR  in  October  2017,  Applicant  testified  that  she
immediately  contacted  both  of  the  creditors  for  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  and  1.b,  in  an  attempt  to
settle both accounts. She indicated that she had multiple conversations with the creditor
for SOR ¶1.a, and she requested documentation regarding her efforts to settle the debt
to  no  avail.  She  also  indicated  that  she  was  told  by  both  creditors  that  both  accounts
were  archived  and  no  longer  in  collection,  and  that  she  should  reach  out  to  the  credit
reporting agencies if she continued to have problems with her credit report.  Both debts
are not reported on her recent credit reports from 2017 and 2018, and she has not had
any  such  problems  with  her  credit  report.  She  could  not  recall  if  she  ever  received  an
IRS  Form 1099-A  for  either  debt. She  acknowledged  that  neither  creditor told  her  that
they  would  not  accept  payment  towards  her  accounts,  but  stated  that  she  and  her
husband  would  have  paid  both  debts  if  she  were  given  information  about  where  she
could send payment.7
As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  and  her  husband  earned  a  combined
income  of  $255,000  annually.  Their  assets,  to  include  their  home,  total  approximately
$529,000.  Applicant  testified  that  she  likely  took  a  credit  counseling  course  when  she
enrolled with the debt consolidation company, and she took another such course on the
date of the hearing. She indicated that she learned budgeting skills and she manages
and  pays  her  bills  in  a  timely  manner.  Their  budget  reflects  a  substantial  positive  net
remainder  after  their  monthly  expenses  are  paid.  She  does  not  have  any  other
delinquent debts.8

As of the date of the hearing, Applicant’s husband worked as a program manager
for a defense contractor and held a security clearance since 1984. He met Applicant in
2008. He testified that he was aware of both of Applicant’s delinquent debts and he also
attributed  them  to  her  divorce.  He  testified  that  she  told  him  that  she  previously
attempted to resolve both debts through a debt consolidation company. He also testified
that she told him that when she recently contacted both creditors, she was told that the
accounts were archived and the debts no longer existed. He consequently advised her
to ask both creditors to provide documentation reflecting such, which she did to no avail.
He  testified  that  they  would  have  paid  both  debts  if  they  were  still  outstanding.  He
testified that she had taken a credit counseling course, and he described her approach
to handling finances as frugal. He testified that they handle their finances jointly, they do
not  have  any  delinquent  debts,  and  they  have  timely  filed  their  income  tax  returns.  A
number  of  character  references  described  Applicant  as  a  trustworthy,  honest,  and
reliable individual.9
