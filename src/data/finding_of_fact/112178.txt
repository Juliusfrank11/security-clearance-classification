Applicant is 54 years old. He graduated from high school in 1982. Applicant has
been employed as an assembly technician by a federal contractor since 1985. He had a
security  clearance  since  then  with  no  issues.  Applicant  reports  no  military  service  and
he has been married since June 1993. Previously, he was married in 1983 and divorced
one year later. He reports one adult daughter, and three adult step-children.
Applicant  reported  delinquent  debts  in  section  26  of  his  security  clearance
application (SCA),2 including failure to file his 2008 federal income tax return, and failure
to file and pay his 2009 federal income taxes as required.  Applicant stated he did not
have enough money to pay $12,000 for 2009 income taxes, and he did not remember
the  circumstances  why  he  forgot  to  file.3  He  stated  that  he  has  now  entered  into  a
repayment plan with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Applicant also reported credit-
card debt and a Nissan automobile loan that he had cosigned for his step-son who was
unable to make payments. The loan went into default and the vehicle was subsequently
repossessed. He ascribes his wife’s loss of employment in April 2015 as the reason for
these debts.4 She had produced 40% of their household earnings.
In his enhanced subject interview (ESI) conducted by an Office of Management
Personnel (OPM) investigator on July 20, 2017, Applicant stated that the 2007 vehicle,
for  which  he  cosigned,  was  repossessed  in  2015.5  He  received  notice  of  a  default
judgment  entered  against  him,  in  the  amount  of  $7,584,  on  April  4,  2017.  This  was  a
result of the repossession of his 2005 Ford. The creditor obtained a writ of garnishment
against  Applicant  in  June  2017.  He  claimed  that  this  judgment  at  SOR  ¶  1.a  was
satisfied when the garnishments of $400 or $500 per month from his paycheck ended in
June 2016.6 He produced no documentary evidence to substantiate this claim.
Applicant’s wife went to the emergency room at a hospital in February 2016, and
her treatment was out of network or part of their deductible. Again, the delinquent debt
escalated  to  a  judgment  against  Applicant  in  the  amount  of  $1,430  and  a  writ  of
garnishment  by  the  creditor  was  filed  at  SOR  ¶  1.i.  Applicant  and  his  wife  both  had
medical  issues.  Applicant  claims  he  does  not  have  the  money  to  pay  his  uncovered
medical  debts  at  SOR  ¶¶  1.i  to  1.o  because  he  is  only  earning  60%  of  his  ordinary

income while he is out on disability since December 2016 for back related issues.7 The
debt placed for collection in the amount of $2,576 at SOR ¶ 1.p arose from a credit-card
linked  to  his  store-0club  membership.  Applicant  stated  that  the  debt  in  the  amount  of
$781 at SOR ¶ 1.q was for an old cell-phone account that he thought he had paid off.
The debt in the amount of $600 placed for collection at SOR ¶ 1.r was for an apartment
that he  cosigned  with  his  step-son.  Applicant  admits  owing  the  latter  debt for  cleaning
fees, but he can not afford to pay it.
Applicant’s financial difficulties started in late 2016 after his wife lost her job and
he  went  out  on  disability  for  a  back  injury,  thereby  losing  the  opportunity  for  overtime
earnings. Applicant’s stepson is living with him due to his own difficulties, and Applicant
is  also  raising  two  grandchildren,  including  one  with  a  disability.  (Item  3)  This  has
caused  enormous  financial  strain  and  Applicant  stated  he  is  “robbing  Peter  to  pay
Paul.”8 He decided it was more important to pay his mortgage and put food on the table,
and he let the credit card and medical debts go into arears. (Item 3) Applicant stated he
was  planning  to  meet  with  a  bankruptcy  attorney  in  July  2017  and  discuss  filing  a
bankruptcy  petition.  However,  no  documentation  has  been  provided  to  reflect  that  he
actually  filed  for  bankruptcy  protection,  except  for  documents  produced  by  the
government  to  show  an  earlier  Chapter  7  petition  was  filed  by  Applicant  in  1994.9
Applicant stated that he has no discretionary income left over at the end of each month
and he is “drowning in debt.” (item 3) He hopes to retire debt-free in three or four years.
In 2008, Applicant changed his IRS Form W-4 withholdings to 10. Thus, he was
not paying  enough federal  income  taxes and  he  owed  the  IRS $12,000  in back  taxes.
He started a repayment plan with the IRS but did not follow through. For the last several
years,  he  was  supposed  to  get  a  $3,000  to  $5,000  income  tax  refund,  but  the  IRS
withheld  these  payments  and  applied  them  to  his  tax  debt.  (Item  3)  He  started  a  new
repayment plan with the IRS on July 25, 2017, and he is supposed to send the IRS $25
a month for one year.10 He attached to his answer proof of only one payment to the IRS
of $100 on April 2, 2018.
In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted owing  the  $3,000 federal  income
tax  deficiency,  the  three  judgements,  and  all  the  other  alleged  consumer  or  medical
debts totaling $20,535. He provided no evidence of payment plans, except with the IRS,
or financial counseling. He did not demonstrate a stream of payments of $25 made to
the  IRS  in  compliance  with  the  purported  repayment  plan.  Instead,  he  provided
evidence of one payment of $100 to the IRS made in April 2018. Applicant provided no
performance  evaluations,  character  reference  letters,  or  evidence  of  community
involvement.
