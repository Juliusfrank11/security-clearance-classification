Applicant admitted some of the financial allegations and denied others. He denied
the  personal  conduct  allegations.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  into  these  findings  of
fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings
of fact.
Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working at
his present job in  2018. He worked for other government contractors before attaining his
current position. He experienced periods of unemployment to include: December 2011 to
April  2012;  July  2012  to  March  2013;  and  June  2013  to  February  2014.  He  has  been
employed  full-time  since  February  of  2014.  He  works  in  the  information  technology  (IT)
field. He served in the Air Force from 1998 to 2008, when he was honorably discharged as
a  staff  sergeant  (paygrade E-5) for medical reasons.  He deployed  three  times during  his
service. He has not completed his application for veterans’ benefits from the VA.  He is a
high  school  graduate  and  has  taken  numerous  college  courses,  but  has  not  obtained  a
degree. He is married for a second time and has two stepchildren from this marriage. He
supports an 11-year-old daughter from his first marriage. (Tr. 6, 20-23; GE1)
The SOR alleged 32 delinquent debts totaling approximately $74,214. Of that total,
over  $50,000  of  the  debt  is  for  delinquent  student  loans.  The  debts  were  listed  in  credit
reports  from  September  2016,  August  2017,  and  April  2019.  The  SOR  also  alleged
Applicant  failed  to  list  two  liens,  a  judgment  and  multiple  collection  debts  on  his  security
clearance application (SCA) executed August 7, 2016, as he was required to do. (SOR ¶¶
1.a – 1.ff, 2.a-2.b; GE 1, 3-4, 8)
Applicant’s wife handles the family’s finances. She does not work outside the home.
Applicant provided documentation showing that the debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.j, 1.p, 1.r, 1.t,
1.z, 1.aa, 1.cc, and 1.ff were paid. Those debts are resolved. He also provided proof that
the  debt  listed  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  was  resolved  when  the  creditor  cancelled  the  debt.  He
documented making payments to the IRS on the cancelled debt. The debts listed in SOR
¶¶ 1.l, 1.w, 1.bb, 1.dd, and 1.ee do not appear on Applicant’s latest credit report and are
resolved for him. (Tr. 38, 41-43, 45-47; 49-50, 53, 55-60; GE 4, 8; AE B-C, E)
The  remaining  non-student-loan  debt  includes  two  telecommunications  collection
accounts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.n-1.o),  which  Applicant  disputed,  but  provided  no  documentation
supporting those disputes. Applicant admitted the debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.s. 1.u, 1.v and
1.x-1.y are still owed. He did not present proof of payment or payment plans. These debts
are unresolved. (Tr. 43-45, 48-53)
Applicant  incurred  over  $50,000  of  student  loans  after  using  all  of  his  GI  Bill
educational  benefits  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.c-.1.i,  1.k,  1.m,  1.q).  These  loans  have  been
delinquent since April 2017. He claims to have spoken with the loan servicing agent, but
he  has  no  plan  to  repay  the  student  loans  except  to  seek  what  his  wife  described  as
additional deferments or a “zero dollar payment plan,” which apparently is a payment plan
based upon the debtor’s income. These debts are unresolved. (36-37, 87-89; AE E)
Applicant is apparently using a budget, though none was produced, and he and his
wife  have  enrolled  in  a  financial  management  class  offered  by  a  well-known  national
financial  expert.  Applicant’s  wife  testified  that  at  the  end  of  the  month,  after  all  bills  and
expenses are paid, they typically have a residual of between $50-$100. (Tr. 61-62, 79; AE
D)
Applicant  presented  six  reference  letters  from  current  and  former  coworkers.  All
describe  him  as  a  trusted  and  competent  professional  who  should  retain  his  security
clearance. (AE A)
Applicant failed to list his liens, a judgment, and other delinquent debts on his SCA,
other than his child support obligations. His student loans were not yet delinquent when he
completed  his  SCA.  He  claimed  that  he  wanted  to  be  able  to  explain  his  answers  when
completing  his  SCA,  but  was  not  allowed  to  do  so  by  his  company.  His  wife’s  testimony
supported that assertion. When Applicant was interviewed by a defense investigator, after
completing  his  SCA,  he  was  asked  about  whether  he  had  any  financial  issues.  Besides
explaining  his  child  support  arrearage,  he  stated  he  was  unaware  of  any  other  debt.  He
was then confronted with other debt listed in his September 2016 credit report. In his SOR
answer, Applicant also claimed his memory is affected by brain injury he suffered while in
the Air Force. He did not provide supporting documentation for this assertion. I did not find
Applicant credible. (Tr. 66-67, 90-91; Answer; GE 1-2)
