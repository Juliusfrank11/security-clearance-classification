After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 53-year-old college graduate. He served in the enlisted ranks in the
National Guard from February 1990 to February 1993, while also working as a Federal
employee from July 1990 to December 1994. (GE A.) He held a top secret clearance and
sensitive compartmented information (SCI) eligibility from August 1990 to late November
2014. (Tr. 60.) Applicant has worked for his current defense-contractor employer since
August 2018. (Tr. 56, 58.) He was previously employed by the company from December
1995  to  June  2012.  According  to  his  former  supervisor,  Applicant  held  his  security
clearance without any issue for the duration of his tenure at the company. (AE 1 Tab 12.)
Applicant married in November 1998. He and his now ex-wife had two sons, who are
16 and 13. (GE A; AE 1 Tab 13; Tr. 62.) He and his ex-wife began having marital problems
in 2008. (Tr. 61.) In late July 2010, Applicant began treatment with a licensed professional
counselor also licensed in marriage and family therapy. (AE 1 Tab 12; Tr. 65.) He and his
spouse attended two or three sessions as a couple, but his ex-wife was not interested in
pursuing marital counseling. (Tr. 68.)
Applicant and his ex-wife separated in July 2011. (AE 1 Tab 13; Tr. 61.) Applicant
moved into an apartment, and his ex-wife continued to reside in the marital residence with
their  two  sons  for  another  year.  (Tr.  41.)  In  January  2012,  on  his  attorney’s  advice,
Applicant began paying spousal and child support totaling $5,007 per month (child support
of $1,204 and spousal support of $3,803) on his gross income of $12,933 per month. (GEs
B, E; AE 1 Tabs 3, 8, 15; Tr. 61) Applicant defaulted on a credit-card account (SOR ¶ 1.b)
after July 2011, and the creditor eventually charged off his account for $34,264. (GE D-E.)
Applicant could not maintain his support obligations and living expenses if he paid the
credit card. (Tr. 96.)
In approximately February 2012, Applicant’s then employer laid off some managerial
staff. Applicant took a reduction in salary of $25,000 so that he could stay on for a few
months until June 2012. (GE A.) Applicant began a new job almost immediately as a senior
principal  systems  engineer  with  another  defense  contractor.  (GE  A;  AE  1  Tab  2.)  On
annual wages totaling $129,498 in 2012, he paid $44,705 in alimony. (AE 1 Tabs 7-8.)
Applicant and his ex-wife were divorced in February 2013. On his monthly gross
salary of $12,833, Applicant agreed to pay spousal support for his wife for seven years
from February 2013, initially at $3,400 per month and then declining by $200 each year
thereafter, subject to recalculation should his earnings decline by 10% or more from a
stipulated $148,000 in gross income and his ex-wife’s earnings equal or exceed $40,000
annually.  Applicant  also  agreed  to  pay  child  support  of  $1,174  per  month  starting  in
February 2013 for his sons, to terminate when his sons turn 18 or graduate from high
school or are not self-supporting and not yet 19 years old. (AE 1 Tabs 8, 13; Tr. 62-65.) In
their divorce settlement, Applicant and his ex-wife were held fully responsible for their own
debts. They agreed on joint legal custody of their sons, with his ex-wife being the primary
custodial parent. (AE 1 Tab 14.) For income tax purposes, Applicant was entitled to claim
their older son as a dependent. (AE 1 Tab 13.)
At the time of their divorce, Applicant and his ex-wife jointly owned their marital
residence, which was encumbered by a deed of trust securing payment of a joint note
(mortgage) in the approximate amount of $449,000 (SOR ¶ 1.a). Applicant was liable for a
home-equity line of credit (HELOC) obtained in February 2006 for $167,671 to add a porch
and for landscaping. (Tr. 45.) Neither Applicant nor his ex-wife made the payments on the
mortgage or the HELOC after July 2012. Applicant could not afford to make the payments.
(Tr. 43.) His rent was $1,850 per month (AE 1 Tab 12), and he had incurred $20,000 to
$30,000 in legal fees for his divorce. (Tr. 97.) A buyer was willing to purchase the home in
a short sale, but the HELOC remained in collections, and they lost the buyer. In April 2013,
the primary lender foreclosed on the property. The house sold at auction in May 2013 to
resolve the first mortgage. The HELOC with a balance of $167,852, was not resolved in the
foreclosure. (GEs B, E; AE 1 Tabs 2-3, 13; Tr. 41.)
Applicant became very depressed, despite ongoing counseling with his therapist for
depression and anxiety. He had 111 counseling sessions  between July 2010 and May
2014.  His  therapist  reports  that  he  was  late  reporting  for  work  at  times,  and  was
disorganized in his thinking. (AE 1 Tab 12.) He stopped checking his mail, and he did not
file his income tax returns when they were due for tax year 2013. (AE B; Tr. 78.) Applicant
understood that he should he filed his return even if he could not pay the taxes owed. He
explained that he “was in a pretty dark place . . . and for a period of time there had a hard
time just making it to and from work.” (Tr. 42.) Collection debts of $308 (SOR ¶ 1.d) and
$283 (SOR ¶ 1.e) owed to a cable television and Internet provider since 2012 went unpaid.
(GE E.) Applicant had boxed up the cable equipment when he moved from an apartment
and then forgot about it. (Tr. 47.)
In August 2014, Applicant started a new job at gross income of $13,000 a month. In
November  2014,  he  left  that  employment  under  mutual  agreement  following  alleged
misconduct. Applicant admits that, in September 2014, he lied about being at a company
site when he was at home. He had charged his time to the contract. (GE A.)
Applicant was unemployed from December 2014 through June 2016. He made little
effort to look for a job before September 2015 “by choice.” (GE A; AE 1 Tab 2.) When
asked about his lengthy unemployment, he testified that he “was completely burned out”
(Tr. 74), but then also indicated that he “was taking it easy and was living life and pursuing
happiness.” (Tr. 77.) He supported himself largely by taking approximately $250,000 in
401(k) withdrawals, which had income implications of $223,687 for tax year 2015. (AE 1
Tab 7; Tr. 75-76.) Applicant did not set aside any funds to pay his taxes or penalties for the
early  withdrawals  from  his  401(k).  (Tr.  76.)  He  continued  to  default  on  some  financial
accounts. He made no payments on a credit card (SOR ¶ 1.c) after November 2014, and
the creditor charged off his account for $1,111. (GEs C-D.) In January 2015, a medical
creditor placed a $25 debt for collection (SOR ¶1.f). (GE E.) On July 29, 2015, the creditor
holding the defaulted HELOC issued a 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt form, for $167,671.
(AE 1 Tab 7.) Available checking account statements from that time are incomplete, but
they show that he made several PayPal purchases for gaming in 2015 as the aforesaid
debts went unpaid. (AE 1 Tab 10.)
On September 2, 2015, Applicant completed an e-QIP in application for a security
clearance to commence work as a systems engineer for a consulting group. He disclosed
that he had not filed his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2014
due to “simple neglect” on his part. Applicant estimated that he was owed tax refunds from
the IRS and state for the tax years because of his spousal support. He described his life as
“somewhat  overwhelming  for  the  last  several  years,”  and  expressed  a  plan  to  file  his
returns  and  pay  any  penalties  by  the  end  of  September  2014.  In  response  to  any
delinquency involving enforcement in the last seven years, Applicant listed the HELOC on
his  marital  home  that  he  was  unable  to  repay  because  of  his  support  obligations  and
payments to his lawyer. Applicant also responded affirmatively to whether he owed any
delinquency on routine accounts. He listed credit card debts of $17,000 (not alleged)3 and
$34,000 (SOR ¶ 1.b), and the HELOC, which he indicated was in collection. He explained
his financial problems, stating in part:
All  of  the  financial  problems  begin  [sic]  as  a  result  of  my  separation  and
divorce from my ex-wife. Prior to then my bill[s] were paid on time. We were
underwater on our house after the market collapsed but home life became
unbearable  so  I  moved  out.  I  could  not  sustain  two  households  on  my
income; as a result debts mounted, including $30,000 in legal fees. I agreed
to take the second mortgage and two credit card bills if she would take the
other four. My thinking at the time was that I would declare bankruptcy but I
have not done so yet. . . . I’ve opt[ed] to walk away from the debts instead
and  to  pay  them  after  I’m  done  paying  spousal  support.  I  am  paying  my
lawyer and my [creditor name omitted] bill, but not the [routine delinquencies
listed on his SF 86]. (GE A.)
Applicant responded negatively on his e-QIP to an inquiry in section 21 concerning
whether he had consulted with a health care professional regarding an emotional or mental
health  condition  in  the  last  seven  years.  (GE  A.)  Instructed  to  respond  “No”  if  the
counseling was “strictly marital, family, grief not related to violence by you” and not court-
ordered,  Applicant  testified  that  he  “honestly  felt  [his]  counseling  was  related  to  his
marriage.” (Tr. 55.) On cross-examination, he admitted that he was treated for anxiety and
depression as well as for marital issues, and that of his 111 sessions with the therapist,
only two or three were with his ex-wife. (Tr. 67-69.) Applicant elaborated about his state of
mind as follows:
So I think a lot of the result—the impact of what happens to me was as a
result of my marriage. And I think working and living within a family was also
part of that. And so when I answered no I thought of it as being a legitimate
answer  of,  I  was  trying  to  repair  myself  because  of  the  injury  that  had
occurred to me because of my marriage and because of how I was working
within a family and having to take care of children who had just been through
a divorce as well. (Tr. 70-71.)
However, Applicant also acknowledged that his counseling was not strictly related to his
marital and family issues. He admitted that “[he] did not pay close attention in answering
that question and [he] should have.” (Tr. 71.)
In January 2016, Applicant’s ex-wife began earning a salary of $4,083 per month.
There  was  no  adjustment  to  his  child  support  or  spousal  support  obligations  to
accommodate for her income. Applicant asserts that he overpaid his spousal support by
$10,000 to $15,000 as a result, but he did not pursue  his ex-wife for the overpayment
because he had fallen behind in his spousal support in June 2016 and July 2016. He had

7.)
paid  only  $826  of  his  then  $2,800  monthly  spousal  support  obligation.  In  July  2016,
Applicant  began  working  as  a  systems  engineer  for  a  defense  contractor  at  a  gross
monthly salary of $14,166. Between August 2016 and January 2017, Applicant paid extra
to catch up on his spousal support. (GE C; AE 1 Tabs 4, 8; Tr. 52-53.)
Realizing that he had to file his delinquent federal and state income tax returns for
tax years 2013 through 2015, Applicant hired a professional tax service in early October
2016.  The  tax  preparer  finished  his  Federal  income  tax  return  for  those  tax  years  in
October 2016. Applicant assets that he filed his delinquent tax returns in October 2016 (Tr.
43, 77), although IRS tax transcripts show that his returns for 2014 and 2015 were not
received until November 17, 2016. On wages of $141,059, he paid $40,800 in alimony, so
his adjusted gross income for 2013 was reduced to $100,259. He underpaid his Federal
income taxes for 2013 by $4,328.4 On adjusted gross income of $105,131 for tax year
2014, he owed $7,028 with penalties and interest. Even though he was unemployed for the
entire year of 2015, he calculated his Federal tax debt at $44,380 for 2015 because of
cancelled debt and the premature withdrawal of his 401(k) on reported adjusted gross
income of $265,887.5  (GE B; AE 1 Tabs 7-8.)
On October 20, 2016, Applicant was notified that he owed state income taxes of
$3,108  (SOR  ¶  1.j).  Applicant  indicates  that  the  taxes  were  owed  for  2012,  although
documentation indicates that his tax liability was for tax year 2015. On his state tax return
for tax year 2014 submitted with the assistance of the tax service, he claimed a refund of
$2,051. (AE 1 Tab 7.) In December 2016, he was assessed a state tax liability of $4,385
for tax year 2015. His wages were levied at $150 every two weeks starting in May 2017 for
his state tax delinquency. (AE 1 Tab 4; Tr. 83-84.)
On January 31, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He indicated that he had filed his delinquent
tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2015 in October 2016, but that the IRS could not
process his return for 2013 because he was missing a required 8332 form from his ex-wife
so that he could claim their older son as a dependent on his income tax return. (GE C; Tr.
44.) Applicant admitted that he owed Federal income taxes of approximately $5,442 for
2014 and $44,380 for 2015. He also acknowledged that he had become $4,358 delinquent
on his spousal support in May 2016 and June 2016, but he paid off the arrearage at $626
per  month  from  July  2016  to  January  2017.  About  his  HELOC  and  credit-card
delinquencies,  Applicant  indicated  that  his  debts  would  be  cancelled  and  become
“unrealized income” for income tax purposes. He did not recognize the collection debts in
SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.f. (GE C.)
4 Applicant provided no evidence to corroborate that his 2013 Federal income tax return was filed with his
2014  and  2015  income  tax  returns  in  October  or  November  2016,  but  the  return  was  signed  by  the  tax
preparer on October 10, 2016, and by Applicant on October 12, 2016. (AE 1 Tab 7.)
5 The cancellation of his HELOC led him to incur a significant tax liability for tax year 2015. He included as
income $78,174 (cancelled debt less the equity in the property) in cancelled debt on his Federal income tax
return for tax year 2015. His remaining tax liability came from the 401(k) transactions in 2015. (GE B; AE 1
Tab 7; Tr. 83.)
From February 2017 through February 2018, Applicant paid child support of $1,539
per month. He paid $2,235 monthly in spousal support from February 2017 through May
2017; $2,146 in June 2017; $2,057 monthly from July 2017 through October 2017; $1,853
in November 2017; $1,645 each in December 2017 and January 2018, but only $87 in
February 2018. (AE 1 Tab 8.)
Applicant filed his Federal income tax return for tax year 2016 on time in April 2017.
On adjusted gross income of $61,945, he was entitled to a $13,225 refund that was applied
by the IRS to taxes Applicant owed for tax year 2012. (GE B; AE 1 Tab 7; Tr. 43.) In May
2017, he re-filed his tax return for tax year 2013 with the IRS. (Tr. 78.)
In response to DOD  CAF interrogatories, Applicant indicated on September 11,
2017,  that  he  owed  a  significant  amount  in  Federal  and  state  income  taxes,  largely
because of the delayed impact of his defaulted HELOC and the taxes and penalty on the
distribution of his 401(k) while he was unemployed. He explained that his nonpayment of
taxes  was  “not  one  of  intent,  but  one  of  means,  and  a  lack  of  understanding  about  a
cleared path forward.” Applicant provided IRS tax transcripts for tax years 2014 and 2015
showing unpaid balances of $8,226 for tax year 2014 and $61,863 for tax year 2015 as of
September 2017. He submitted a notice from the IRS of a request for more information
before it could provide a tax transcript for 2013. A collection notice from the state showed a
balance due of $3,108. Applicant submitted a personal financial statement indicating that
the state had levied against his wages and was taking $300 a month to address his state
tax liability. He estimated his net monthly discretionary income at $743. (GE B.)
On October 25, 2017, Applicant paid his $308 cable bill in collection (SOR ¶ 1.d).
On October 26, 2017, he paid the $25 medical debt in collection (SOR ¶ 1.f). On October
30,  2017,  Applicant  made  a  final  payment  of  $2,317  to  fully  resolve  his  state  tax
delinquency  for  tax  year  2015  under  a  tax  amnesty  program.  On  October  21,  2017,
Applicant  authorized  recurring  payments  of  $50  every  two  weeks  from  his  checking
account from November 2017 to April 2018 toward his $34,264 credit-card delinquency
(SOR ¶ 1.b). He indicated in response to the SOR that he would renew the payments until
the debt is paid. (AE A Tab 3.) At his hearing, he testified that he has not missed any
payments since entering into the agreement. (Tr. 98.) On November 6, 2017, he returned
the cable equipment to resolve the collection debt in SOR ¶ 1.e. On November 9, 2017, he
satisfied  the  $1,111  credit-card delinquency (SOR ¶ 1.c). (AE 1 Tabs 3-4; Tr. 84, 95.)
About the delayed resolution, Applicant testified that he was overwhelmed with his debts,
and it “just got lost in the chaos.” (Tr. 99.) Applicant admitted that he was irresponsible and
should have addressed his debts sooner. (Tr. 102.) Available checking account statements
for  Applicant  covering  the  period  July  25,  2017,  through  October  23,  2017,  show  that
Applicant made several purchases for gaming and ITunes before his delinquencies were
paid. (AE 3.)
As of October 2017, Applicant owed the IRS approximately $89,105 for tax years
2012 through 2015 ($10,534 for 2012, $6,403 for 2013, $8,458 for 2014, and $63,708 for
2015). (AE 1 Tab 4.) The issuance of the SOR on October 20, 2017, prompted him to
contact the IRS on November 30, 2017, about an installment plan to repay his substantial
tax delinquency.6 (AE 1 Tab 6; Tr. 79.) On December 12, 2017, Applicant entered into an
installment agreement to pay his Federal income tax delinquency at $524 per month. He
made payments of $417 and $524 in February 2018 and $524 in March 2018 that were
applied to his tax liability for 2012. Payments of $524 in April 2018 and again in May 2018
were applied to his income tax liability for tax year 2014. (AE 1 Tabs 5-6.)
In  February  2018,  Applicant  was  laid  off  from  his job  paying  him  approximately
$170,000 a year. (Tr. 72-73.) Security clearance and access requests had been submitted
for Applicant, but they had not been granted, and he was let go for lack of unclassified
work. (AE 1 Tab 12.) He paid nothing in spousal or child support while he was unemployed.
(AE 1 Tab 8.) In April 2018, he moved in with his parents because he was unemployed.
(AE 1 Tab 2.)
Applicant filed his income tax returns for tax year 2017 on time. (Tr. 43, 85.) On
adjusted gross income of $137,203, he expected a tax refund of $13,147. (AE 1 Tab 7.) In
July 2018, he received notice from the IRS that his Federal tax liability for tax year 2012
had been satisfied, but he still owed Federal income taxes of $6,580 for 2013, $3,885 for
2014,  and  $68,903  for  2015.  In  August  2018,  Applicant  began  working  for his current
employer at  a monthly income of approximately $12,916, and he renewed his support
payments.  (AE  1  Tabs  2,  8-9;  Tr.  56,  58,  72.)  He  contacted  the  IRS  to  resume  his
installment agreement at $524 per month, but no payments were deducted from his bank
account. In November 2017, the IRS notified him of its intention to cancel his installment
agreement  for  failure  to  provide  income  verification  to  the  IRS  (Collection  Information
Statement Form 433-F) that he had not realized was required. He submitted the form in
December 2017, but processing was delayed because of the partial government shutdown
over the holidays. In late January 2019, the IRS returned his debt to collections. (Tr. 49.)
On February 7, 2019, Applicant executed a new Installment Agreement Request with the
IRS, proposing to repay $81,383 at $525 per month. (AE 1 Tabs 2, 5-6.) As of Applicant’s
hearing in mid-February 2019, Applicant was awaiting a response from the IRS about his
proposed installment plan. (Tr. 81-82.) Applicant intends to repay his tax delinquency. (Tr.
45.) His income tax returns for 2018 were not yet prepared as of February 2019, so he was
unsure whether he would owe taxes for 2018. (Tr. 85.)
In October or November 2018, Applicant’s car was “totaled” by a fallen tree. He
obtained a $23,000 loan for a 2018 model-year vehicle that he is repaying at $560 per
month. (Tr. 87-88.) As of February 2019, Applicant was paying his parents $500 a month to
cover  rent  and  monies  given  him  previously.  He  was  current  on  his spousal and  child
support. (Tr. 65.) He testified that he had about $5,000 after paying his car loan, support
obligations,  and  parents,  but  that  did  not  include  his  other  expenses,  such  as  food,
gasoline, or car insurance. (Tr. 91.)  He had approximately $6,000 in savings to move back
to his previous state of residency to be near his sons. He believes he can obtain a job
transfer with his current employer, although it would be predicated on him being granted
6 Applicant testified that he owed the IRS as much as $96,000 at one point, but that his tax liability has been
reduced by $26,000 through the IRS interception of his tax refunds for tax years 2016 and 2017. (Tr. 51.) He
expressed his belief that he had made some tax payments before the October to November 2017 time frame
(Tr. 82), although he provided no documentation of any such payments.
access  to  SCI.  The  transfer  would  likely  mean  an  increase  of  $1,500  in  his  monthly
expenses, although he estimated that he would likely still have a monthly surplus of $896.
(Tr. 86-93.) His spousal support is scheduled to end in January 2020. (AE A 1 Tab 8.) He
then  plans  to  pay  an  additional  $1,200  per  month  toward  his  IRS  debt.  (Tr.  93.)  He
estimates that it is going to take him more than six years to satisfy his Federal income tax
delinquency. (Tr. 94.)
Applicant owes his divorce attorney $13,000 to $14,000. He testified that he has
been paying about $100 a month consistently, except when he was unemployed between
November 2014 and July 2016. Applicant stated that his attorney is allowing him to make
payments when he is able. (Tr. 97-98.) Available checking account statements show $200
payments on May 26, 2015, and February 22, 2016. (AE 1 Tab 10.) His checking account
activity from July 25, 2017, through October 23, 2017, shows one payment to his divorce
attorney during those three months, of $75 on July 28, 2017. (AE 3.) He did not provide
any documentation of the claimed $100 consistent payments.
Over the years, Applicant’s parents have given him about $18,000. When he was
short of funds, they gave him about $4,000 to pay his spousal and child support. They paid
about  $2,000  for  him  to  put  his  belongings  in  storage  in  April  2018.  They  purchased
furnishings for him in the past. He started repaying them at $1,500 a paycheck in August
2017, but he recently reduced the amount to $500. (Tr. 103-104.)
Applicant  provided  favorable  character  reference  letters  from  three  former  co-
workers who had ample opportunity to observe his work during his previous tenure with his
current employer. They attest to Applicant’s dedication to their mission and to Applicant’s
recognition and protection of sensitive data. In their experience, Applicant had a “unique
combination of analytic experience and technical skills.” (AE 1 Tab 12.)
