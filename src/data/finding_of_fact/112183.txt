Applicant is 33 years old and employed by a defense contractor. He is single, with
one  child.  Applicant  is  seeking  to  retain  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his
employment.
Applicant is a disabled, retired Soldier. He was severely injured on active duty in a
combat zone. He suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI), as well as other physical injuries.
He  also  has  been  diagnosed  with  Post-Traumatic  Stress  Disorder  (PTSD).  He  was
medically retired in 2010 with the rank of Specialist (E-4). He continues to have physical
and  psychological  issues  connected  to  his  military  service.  These  issues  include
organizational skills, ability to prioritize, and memory lapses. This situation had an impact
on  his  ability  to  organize  his  finances  and  pay  his  debts  for  several  years.  (Applicant
Exhibits N, Q at 47-61; Tr. 41-49, 54, 153.)
Applicant  was  medically  retired  in  February  2010.  He  was  unemployed  or
underemployed  until  November  2011,  when  he  was  hired  by  the  predecessor  of  his
current employer. This also had an impact on his ability to pay his debts. (Government
Exhibit 1 at Section 13A.)

supported  by  admissions  of  the  Applicant,  and  credit  reports  submitted  by  the

The  business  manager  of  Applicant’s  union  has  helped  Applicant  organize  his
finances.  This  includes  determining  the  full  extent  of  his  debt  load  and  a  plan  moving
forward to resolve it. (Applicant Exhibits I and J; Tr. 105-109.)
Applicant  has  had  some  family  issues  that  have  impinged  on  his  finances,
including his grandmother’s recent death and the hospitalization of his mother. Applicant
realized that he must take care of his own indebtedness first, in order to help his family
into the future. (Applicant Exhibits H, Q at 44-46; Tr. 109-114, 141-143.)
Applicant’s  current  financial  situation  is  stable.  He  lives  very  frugally,  renting  a
room in a house. Applicant continuously monitors his credit and pays off his older debts
as his income allows. He is current on child support payments of $900 a month for his
daughter who lives in a different city. He has worked hard over the last several years to
get his financial house in order, and has a plan to pay the rest of his debts in the near
future.  Applicant  successfully  paid  off  an  automobile  in  2016.  He  also  paid  off  three
personal loans totaling approximately $20,000 including interest between 2014 and 2016.

recommended him for a position of trust. (Tr. 29-39.)

the defense industry. Applicant’s program manager stated, “I trust [Applicant] to continue
working in classified spaces and I have never found a reason to doubt or question him.”
A coworker stated, “I have always trusted [Applicant] with information and I have never
found a reason to doubt or question him. I can confidently attest that he will not let you
down.” (Applicant Exhibits B and C.)
