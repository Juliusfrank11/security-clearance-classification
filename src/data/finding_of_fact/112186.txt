Applicant  is  41  years  old.  He  was  married  in  2003  and  separated  in  2014.  His
divorce  became  final  in  June  2017.  (Tr.  73)  Applicant  and  his  ex-wife  raised  five
children. The oldest three are adults, in the service or college. Applicant and his ex-wife
share  custody  of  the  youngest  two  boys,  ages  12  and  14.  He  obtained  a  bachelor’s
degree  in  2010,  and  reports  no  military  service.  (Tr.  53-54)  Applicant  has  been
employed by a federal contractor as a consultant since November 2011. Applicant’s ex-
wife did not work outside the home.
The SOR alleged a debt to the federal government for past-due [sales] taxes in
the amount of $115,861 (SOR ¶1.a) and a debt to state A for past-due-income taxes in
the amount of $10,486 (SOR ¶ 1.b). It also alleged a charged-off debt for a credit card
in  the  amount  of  $62,147  (SOR  ¶1.c).  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  his
Answer to the SOR. Applicant testified credibly that he initially had tax problems when
he changed status from a W-2 to a 1099 employee in 2009-2010. (Tr. 58-60) He didn’t
understand  that  he  was  supposed  to  estimate  and  pay  quarterly  taxes.  He  had  a
certified  public  accountant  (CPA)  prepare  and  file  returns  at  the  end  of  each  tax  year
(TY). However, he could not afford to pay the taxes due. So, he entered into a payment
plan and has paid all income taxes owed for TY 2009-2010, which are not alleged in the
SOR.
Applicant  was  working  full  time  as  a  federal  contractor  in  2013.  He  decided  to
start a retail store to supplement his income. (Tr. 79) He provided the lease for Chatman
Solutions,  LLC,  which  required  that  he  make  payments  of  $5,500  over  five  years
starting  on  November  1,  2013.  (AE  B)  This  was  his  first  venture  into  retail.  Almost
immediately,  a  large  Walmart  store  opened  up  across  the  street  from  his  store,
siphoning off business. (Tr. 58) Applicant struggled and didn’t even break even on the
store. (Tr. 53-54) He slept on a couch in the back of the store as he separated from his
wife in 2014. His ex-wife did not work, he had children in college, his store was failing,

security clearance application (SCA).
and now he was headed for a divorce proceeding. (Tr. 53) Applicant admitted he did not
pay the required quarterly taxes on his LLC for TY 2012 to TY 2016.
Applicant submitted answers to interrogatories on November 13, 2017, verifying
an  attached  summary  of  his  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  conducted  on  June  12,
2017. (GE 2) He attached a packet of documents including: payment coupons to state A
for delinquent sales tax as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. These confirmed his testimony that the
state-tax  lien  is  in  a  repayment  plan;  (Tr.  97)  IRS  tax  transcripts  reflecting  a  total
balance of overdue federal taxes owed by the Chatman Solutions, LLC, for TY 2012 –
2016, of $115,047 as of October 2017; a payment plan for overdue income-taxes owed
to state A in the amount of $10,486 with several tax lien expungements; and a portion of
a  divorce  decree  showing  that  [Applicant]  husband  was  responsible  for  working  out  a
payment  plan  with  the  IRS,  and  state  A,  for  all  tax  debts.  GE  8  reflects  a  series  of
intermittent payments of approximately $458 made between May 2014 and July 2017 to
satisfy  the  state  tax  liens.  Applicant  provided  a  sheaf  of  documents  showing  a
continuous stream of $200 payments to state A department of revenue from July 2012
to November 2018. (AE F) The remaining balance owed to State A is $16,911.
Applicant  testified  and  provided  documents  showing  that  he  opened  a  credit
card  account  in  late  2012  to  pay  expenses  for  his  retail  store.  (Tr.  81)  He  put  in
approximately $60,000 to $70,000 but the store always lost money. (Tr. 88) The credit
card  went  into  default  in  early  2014.  (Tr.  88)  GE  6  shows  a  judgment  entered  against
Applicant  in  a  county  court  in  the  amount  of  $68,772  owed  to  this  creditor.  Applicant
entered  a  repayment  agreement  and  demonstrated  a  series  of  $100  dollar  check
payments to the creditor or its collection agency from April 2016 to November 2018. (AE
G)
Applicant  testified  and  produced  documentation  showing  that  the  lien  entered
against him in the amount of $1,400 by a homeowner’s association (HOA) as alleged in
SOR ¶ 1.d has been paid in full. (Tr. 96) This was owed for a vacant parcel of land for
which  Applicant  has  a  mortgage  loan,  and  he  agreed  to  keep  making  the  payments
pursuant to the divorce decree.
Applicant’s  IRS  tax  transcripts  and  W-2’s  were  attached  to  his  answers  to
interrogatories. (GE 2) They reveal his adjusted gross income (AGI) of $247,000 in TY
2012; $158,000 in TY 2013; $143,000 in TY 2014; $160,000 in TY 2015; and $124,000
in  TY  2016.  He  testified  that  he  filed  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  timely  each
year, but he could not afford to pay the taxes owed due to his alimony and child support
payments, failing store, and divorce. (Tr. 66, 139) He admits to also making some bad
decisions about money. (Tr. 120) He contemplated filing for bankruptcy protection, but
considered that to be a cop out, and avoided it. (Tr. 145)
Applicant testified about an earlier installment payment plan that he had with the
IRS in 2013 for overdue taxes from TY 2011. He detrimentally relied on a CPA who led
Applicant  to  believe  this  was  in  a  non-collectible  status.  (Tr.  126-128)  His  repayment
agreement with the IRS fell apart after 18 months when Applicant encountered financial
distress  with  his  retail  store,  and  became  separated  in  2014.  (Tr.  122)  On  March  21,
2018, Applicant entered into an Offer in Compromise with the IRS after providing all of
his financial information to the IRS. (Tr. 106) The IRS used a formula to set the amount
of  the  payment  due  and  he  settled  for  $8,000,  conditional  upon  his  timely  filing  and
paying all taxes due for five years. (AE E, Tr. 113-117) An October 7, 2018, letter from
the IRS to Applicant accepted his offer in compromise and included a copy of a check to
IRS  from  Applicant  for  $6,575.  This  was  the  balance  owed  for  TY  2012,  according  to
IRS tax transcripts. (AE E) The tax transcripts reflect a zero balance owed for TYs 2013,
2014, 2015, and a $15,185 balance for TY 2016. (AE E) Applicant testified credibly that
all of his overdue federal taxes have now been paid off. (Tr. 117-118)
Applicant  provided  evidence  of  financial  counseling  from  his  aunts  and  a  well-
known company with an action plan to formulate a budget and payment plan. (AE D, Tr.
145) He also provided 16 character reference letters, all attesting to his positive attitude,
integrity,  work  ethic,  trustworthiness  and  reliability.  (AE  A)  Applicant  had  his  pastor
testify on his behalf at the hearing. (Tr. 37-42) He testified that Applicant is a family man
and  actively  involved  in  his  church  and  he  was  even  elected  recently  to  the  vestry  or
leadership.  Applicant  volunteers  his  time  in  the  community  and  he  is  well  respected,
trustworthy,  and  reliable.  The  pastor  has  no  reservations  about  Applicant  holding  a
security clearance.
