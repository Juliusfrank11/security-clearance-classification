Applicant is 45 years old. He attended some college courses and is just short of
an associate’s degree. Applicant was married to his first wife from 2008 until they divorced
in 2012. He married his second wife in May 2014, and they separated in July 2015, and
divorced in January 2016. Applicant has worked for his current employer as an electrical
installer since late 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 20-21, 34)
During  his  first  marriage,  Applicant  paid  the  family  mortgage  and  financially
supported members of his wife’s family. He used credit cards to supplement their income
and cover household expenses. When they divorced in 2012, he was required to assume
responsibility for all of the marital debts, including the debts alleged in the SOR, and his
wife  was  awarded  their  house.  After  the  divorce,  Applicant  was  unable  to  continue  to
make the minimum monthly payments, in part, because he was laid off from his job in
early 2013. He also financially supported his second wife throughout their marriage. When
Applicant started working for his current employer, in late 2016, his salary nearly doubled.
(Tr. 20-23, 27, 33, 37)
Applicant  opened  the credit  card  debt alleged  in  SOR  ¶ 1.a.  in  1996  and  made
payments until approximately 2013. The debt was charged off by the creditor in  March
2014. In December 2017, Applicant was issued a 1099-C for cancellation of debt, which
required  him  to  pay  $6,500  in  state and federal  income  taxes  on  the  discharged  debt.
Applicant made payments toward these debts in 2018, and resolved the outstanding state
and federal income tax liabilities in early 2019. (GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 2; AE A; AE D; AE H;
AE I; AE J; Tr. 17, 19-20, 22, 25, 30, 36)
Applicant opened the credit card account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. in 2006 and made
payments  until  approximately  2012  or  2013.  He  attempted  to  make  settlement
arrangements with the creditor several times, but experienced difficulty communicating
with the creditor. In January 2019, Applicant signed an agreement to settle the debt for
just under $8,000 and made a $500 payment. (GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 2; AE A; AE G; AE J;
Tr. 22-24, 29-30)
Applicant’s current finances are in good standing, and he has no new delinquent
debts.  He  provided  documentation  that  he  has  resolved  and  paid  debts  that  were  not
alleged in the SOR. Finally, he attended credit counseling and follows a written budget.
