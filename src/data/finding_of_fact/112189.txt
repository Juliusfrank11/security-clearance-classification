In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all of the factual
allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.g.).
Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration
of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving
as a claims processer with her current employer since May 1998. She graduated from
high school in 1983. She also received an associate’s degree in 1985. She has never
served  in  the  U.S.  military.  She  has  never  held  a  security  clearance,  but  has  been
occupying a position of public trust since 1998. Applicant was married in 1985. She has
one son, born in 2000.
Financial Considerations1
There  was  nothing  unusual  about  Applicant’s  finances  until  2006  when  she
decided not to place her mother in a nursing home and instead became her caretaker.
Applicant’s  mother  was  afflicted  with  a  variety  of  health  issues:  diabetes,  high  blood
1 General source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can be found in the
following  exhibits:  GE  1  (e-QIP,  dated  February  19,  2015);  GE  2  (Personal  Subject  Interview,  dated
December  4,  2015);  GE  3  (Combined  Experian,  TransUnion,  and  Equifax  Credit  Report,  dated  June  4,
2016); GE 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated September 29, 2017); and Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, dated
November 8, 2017.
pressure,  diabetes-related  foot  surgery,  and  Alzheimer’s.  Eventually  her  mother’s
situations necessitated obtaining a wheelchair, a lifter (to get her into and out of bed, and
a ramp for egress and ingress to and from the house. Although there was some financial
support  through  Medicare  and  Medicaid,  Applicant  was  responsible  for  uncovered
expenses. In 2009, Applicant’s mother-in-law died from cancer. Applicant’s husband lost
his $25 an hour job in 2010 when his company shut down in the area. In order to generate
some income, he started driving a bus (making between $13 and $15 per hour) and he
did seasonal landscaping. Applicant was also forced to borrow funds from her 401(k). In
2012, Applicant’s  son was  diagnosed  with  keratoconus  –  a  progressive  eye  disease  –
that resulted in three surgeries in 2013 and one in 2015, as well as different prescription
medications  which  he  continues  to  take.  In  2013,  Applicant’s  mother  passed  away.  In
June 2015, her husband had foot surgery, and he was out of work for two months.
The continuing combination of family health issues caused expenses to increase,
and her husband’s health and employment issues reduced the family income. As a result,
some accounts became delinquent. A federal tax lien was filed when Applicant’s husband
erred in applying his Form 1099 associated with his landscaping earnings. As a result,
their  anticipated  federal  income  tax  refund  for  a  subsequent  year  was  applied  to  the
earlier year. Applicant’s most recent federal and state income tax refunds amounted to
over $4,000, and those funds were used primarily to make mortgage payments to make
sure it remained current, and for her son’s school expenses.
The SOR identified seven purportedly delinquent accounts that had been placed
for  collection  or  charged-off,  as  generally  reflected  by  Applicant’s  June  2016  or
September  2017  credit  reports.  Those  debts  total  approximately  $34,302.  The  current
status of those accounts is as follows:
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): This is a joint installment loan with an unpaid and past-due balance
of $13,438 that was placed for collection and charged off.2 Applicant reached out to the
creditor and agreed to a repayment plan under which she commenced making monthly
$50  payments  before  November  2017.  She  submitted  documentation  of  routine  past
monthly  payments  with  a  recent  receipt,  dated  July  25,  2018,  reflecting  a  reduced
remaining balance of $12,988.3 Applicant also discussed settlement possibilities, and the
creditor  initially  offered  to  settle  the  account  for  a  one-time  payment  of  $6,494,  or  a
monthly payment of $780 for ten months, neither of which Applicant could afford. Another
option  was  an  increased  monthly  payment  of  $75,  commencing  in  September  2018.
Applicant  claimed  that  she  agreed  to  this  option,4  but  she  has  not  submitted  any
documents to support any such payments. Nevertheless, the account is in the process of
being resolved.

4 AE N (Statement, undated).
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): This is an unspecified type of account with an unpaid and past-due
balance of $3,891 that was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser.5 Applicant
reached  out  to  the  debt  purchaser  and  agreed  to  a  repayment  plan  under  which  she
commenced  making  monthly  $50  payments  before  November  2017.  She  submitted
documentation  of  routine  past  monthly  payments  with  a  recent  receipt,  dated  July  24,
2018, reflecting a cumulative payment of $350.6 Applicant also discussed a settlement
possibility, but Applicant could not afford the one offered to her. She intends to increase
her  monthly  payments  for  six  months  before  exploring  another  settlement  option.7
Nevertheless, the account is in the process of being resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): This is a joint secured installment loan, which Applicant claims was
made  to  purchase  a  vehicle,  with  an  unpaid  balance  of  $3,727  that  was  placed  for
collection and charged off in 2014.8 Applicant contends that she called the original creditor
and the eventual creditor, to validate the account, but neither creditor had any information
about it. She claims that she searched for paperwork and found a letter stating that the
balance was $463.50, and that on February 28, 2014, she paid the creditor $471.22 with
her  debit  card  and  has  a  confirmation  number.9  While  Applicant  is  specific  in  her
references and claims, she failed to submit any documents to: (1) connect the original
creditor to the eventual creditor; (2) support her position that she contacted the creditors
or  was  advised  that  they  had  no  information  regarding  the  accounts;  (3)  support  her
position that she made the claimed payment; or (4) support her position that the account
has been paid in full. Until those documents are submitted, it is impossible to determine
the current status of the account. The account has not been resolved.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.d. and 1.g.): These are two medical accounts with unpaid balances of
$101  and  $123  that  were  placed  for  collection  and  charged  off.10  Applicant  and  the
creditor  agreed  to  a  settlement  regarding  the  smaller  of  the  two  accounts,  and  on
December 10, 2015 – two years before the SOR was issued – she paid the remaining
balance  of  $76.13,  settling  the  account  in  full.  With  respect  to  the  larger  of  the  two
accounts, on December 10, 2015 – again two years before the SOR was issued – she
paid the creditor $123.84.11 Both accounts have been resolved.

be  noted  that  Applicant’s  June  2016  credit  report  clearly  states  that  both  accounts  were  paid  off  in
December  2015.  See  GE  3,  supra  note  1,  at  15.  The  September  2017,  incorrectly  reports  the  smaller
account as unpaid. See GE 4, supra note 1, at 2.
(SOR ¶ 1.e.): This is consumer loan from a financial institution with a high credit of
about $10,000 that was placed for collection. A judgment for $11,524 was filed in 2014.12
Applicant explained that she had made monthly payments of about $300 for two to three
years.  When  her  financial  issues  made  it  difficult  to  make  the  regular  payments,  the
creditor agreed to accept reduced payments.13 She failed to submit any documentation
to support her contention that before the judgment was filed she had made any payments.
By July 2017, the unpaid balance on the judgment had increased to $14,272, including
interest.  Applicant  reached  out  to  the  collection  attorneys  and  discussed  settlement
possibilities,  and  she  was  offered  a  proposed  settlement  of  60  percent  of  the  existing
balance  to  be  paid  by  October  2017,14  but  she  was  unable  to  agree  to  that  offer.
Negotiations continued, and in November 2017, Applicant agreed to a repayment plan
under  which  she  authorized  automatic  withdrawals  from  her  account  in  the  amount  of
$50. She submitted documentation of routine past monthly payments. Unfortunately for
Applicant, despite her continuing monthly payments, because of the accrual of interest,
the  unpaid  balance  keeps  increasing.  As  of  April  2018,  it  was  $14,659.15  Applicant
intended to continue making the monthly payments, and after six months, she expected
to  receive  another  settlement  offer.  While  the  record  is  silent  as  to  what  subsequent
events had occurred, the account is in the process of being resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.f.): This is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $1,499 that
was  placed for collection and  sold  to a  debt purchaser.16  Applicant  reached out  to  the
debt purchaser and agreed to a repayment plan under which she authorized automatic
withdrawals  from  her  account  in  the  amount  of  $63.  She  submitted  documentation  of
routine  past  monthly  payments,  and  expects  the  account  to  be  paid  in  full  by  August
2019.17 The account is in the process of being resolved.
In addition to the accounts alleged in the SOR, Applicant addressed various other
accounts that were not alleged in the SOR, and they have been resolved. Other than the
accounts alleged in the SOR, Applicant is not aware of any other delinquent accounts.
Following the hearing, Applicant prepared a Personal Financial Statement to reflect her
combined  monthly  net  income  ($4,572);  monthly  expenses  ($4,324),  including  those
made  to  her  creditors  described  above;  and  a  monthly  remainder  ($203)  available  for
discretionary  saving  or  spending.18  The  unanticipated  expenses  associated  with  the

earlier  described  problems  have  disappeared,  and  Applicant  has  made  significant
progress  in  stabilizing  her  finances  and  avoiding  other  financial  delinquencies.  In  July
2018, Applicant completed financial counseling with a certified financial planner.19
Character References and Work Performance
One friend, who has known Applicant for 15 years, described her as a hard-working
person  of  integrity  who  is  very  hospitable,  disciplined,  kind-hearted,  loyal,  strong,  and
morally  excellent.20  Applicant’s  annual  performance  reviews  over  the  years  generally
reflect  an  individual  whose  performance  exceeds  expectations,  although  there  are
instances where she is either exceptional or merely meets expectations.21
