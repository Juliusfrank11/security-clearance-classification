After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I find that SOR ¶ 1.f does
not allege additional conduct of security concern, but rather reflects the disposition for the
offenses covered in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.e. My findings of fact are as follows:
Applicant is a 24-year-old high school graduate, who completed certificate programs
to be a nurse’s aide in late 2013 and an automotive technician in July 2016.  He is not
married  but  is  in  a  cohabitant  relationship  with  his  fiancée.  They  have  a  two-year-old
daughter. (GEs 1-2; AE A; Tr. 20, 26-27, 32.) Applicant is employed in automobile sales,
but  he  has  an  offer  of  defense-contractor  employment  contingent  on  him  obtaining  a
security clearance. (Tr. 27-28.)
Applicant began using mood-altering substances as a teenager. He was influenced
by friends in his environment and used marijuana on a daily basis with two friends from
June 2010 to June 2014. He purchased the drug from those friends, and he sold marijuana
to his friends. The date when he started drinking alcohol is not in the record, although he
volunteered that he drank alcohol in quantity of five drinks or more to intoxication until early
2015, when he then moderated his consumption. (GE 4; Tr. 30, 70.)
Applicant also began committing crimes as a teenager. At age 15 in July 2009,
Applicant broke into some vehicles with a friend and stole loose change and a GPS unit.
He  was  charged  with  felony  burglary  and  placed  on  two  years  of  probation.  In
approximately July 2011, Applicant was loitering at a local baseball field with three friends
when the police arrived. Intoxicated from drinking at a party earlier that night, Applicant ran
into a pharmacy and stole five packs of cigarettes. He was given accelerated rehabilitation
for the theft. (GEs 1, 4.)
The month following his high school graduation, Applicant started the nurse’s aide
program at a local community college in July 2011. That September, he began working a
part-time retail job. (GEs 1, 4.)
On March 20, 2012, Applicant was arrested for sale of a controlled substance, a
felony.1 He was a passenger in a vehicle with some friends when they were pulled over by
the state police for a brake light issue. The police smelled marijuana because Applicant
and his friends had been smoking the drug in the backseat, and Applicant had multiple
bags of marijuana in his jacket. (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 52-53.) Applicant completed court-ordered
treatment for his marijuana use from September 2012 to November 2012. (GE 1; Tr. 37.)
1 During his subject interview, Applicant recalled the offense as occurring in May 2012, and that he was at a
carnival with three bags of marijuana to sell and to smoke. He indicates that an unknown individual walked up
to him and gave him a cell phone for the marijuana. Applicant was then arrested in a vehicle in the parking lot.
(GE 4.) An FBI record shows that he was arrested in March 2012 for sale of a controlled substance. (GE 3.)
The statute Applicant violated, Section 21a-277(b) provides in part:
(b) Any person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds,
transports with intent to sell or dispense, possesses with intent to sell or dispense, offers,
gives  or  administers  to  another  person  any  controlled  substance,  except  a  narcotic
substance, or a hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, except as authorized in this
chapter, may, for the first offense, be fined not more than twenty-five thousand dollars or be
imprisoned  not  more  than  seven  years  or  be  both  fined  and  imprisoned;  and,  for  each
subsequent  offense,  may  be  fined  not  more  than  one  hundred  thousand  dollars  or  be
imprisoned not more than fifteen years, or be both fined and imprisoned.
The FBI record does not indicate that he was arrested for possession with intent to sell as alleged in the SOR,
although intent to sell would violate the same statute.
Applicant sold marijuana with some regularity, including at times once or twice a
week, from 2012 to September 2014. He sold the drug usually to friends and “here and
there” to friends of his friends. His profit from the marijuana sales was usually enough for
him to purchase more for his personal consumption. (Tr. 35-37, 45.)
On  April 7, 2012, Applicant was stopped for OUI and reckless driving, although
formal charges were not filed against him until December 2012. Applicant had consumed
alcohol at a party when his companion suggested that he drive because he appeared to be
more sober. He drove her to another party, where Applicant became “totally drunk.” He
then  drove  three  friends  to  a  store,  but  on  returning  to  the  party  with  his  friends,  he
“blacked out” and crashed his vehicle into a house. Applicant was unconscious, and broke
his neck and back in the accident. (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 56-61.) He was ordered into alcohol
counseling following his arrest in December 2012, which he completed. (Tr. 38-39.)
Applicant was terminated from his part-time retail job in July 2012 after he failed to
report for work. He failed to keep track of his work schedule and was often tardy. Applicant
also  speculates  that  his  co-workers  may  have  told  his  supervisor  that  he  smelled  of
marijuana. He had rolled a “blunt” in the bathroom the day before his termination, although
he claims it was for future use. (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 43-44.)
Applicant was unemployed from July 2012 to June 2013. He supported himself by
selling marijuana. He also spent his time partying. (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 44.) On June 17, 2013,
Applicant was sitting on his porch when a minor age 15 or 16 spat at him. It escalated into
a physical altercation. A few weeks later, the police charged Applicant with risk of injury, a
felony, and with assault, 3rd degree, and disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors. (GEs 1,
3-4;  Tr.  62-64.)  Applicant  now  asserts  that  he  “just  basically  restrained”  the  minor  by
putting him in a headlock to calm him down.2 He denies that he injured the youth in any
way and attributes his arrest to the youth’s brother, who disliked Applicant. (Tr. 64.)
Applicant worked as a part-time cashier at a doughnut shop from June 2013 to
August 2013. He was late for work several times because he was out too late partying and
did not report for his 5:00 a.m. shift. He was issued written warnings three or four times
before being fired for tardiness. Applicant was unemployed for the next year. He supported
himself by selling marijuana. (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 45.)
On March 1, 2014, Applicant was arrested for felony sale of a controlled substance
and for misdemeanor possession of marijuana. Applicant was stopped by the police in
2 Applicant testified about the July 2013 assault of a minor, as follows:
They said that [the minor] was bleeding. And they said that he was hurt. But the only thing I
did to him was I put him in a headlock and I had to calm him down. He kept trying to swing at
me. But I already knew that he was young and underage. So I just basically restrained him.
And even after the fact that he spit on me even after everything got broken up and all that
stuff. (Tr. 64.)
route to a party after he threw something from his vehicle. He had three bags of marijuana
on him to sell at a party, and he smelled of marijuana.3 (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 65-66.)
On June 26, 2014, Applicant was arrested for felony possession of marijuana, felony
sale of a controlled substance, felony conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to sell,
and  felony  conspiracy  to  sell  a  controlled  substance.  A  friend  contacted  him  about
purchasing some marijuana from him in a local parking lot. When Applicant arrived, the
police  arrested  him  for  selling  marijuana  for  financial  profit.  He  had  four  ounces  of
marijuana in his possession. (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 66-67.) Applicant asserts that he ceased his
marijuana use in June 2014 because it made him feel “demotivated.” (GE 4.) He continued
to  sell  marijuana  until  September  2014  to  pay  for  his  lawyer.  He  possessed  some
marijuana after his arrest and he “wasn’t going to give it away.” (Tr. 45-46.)
With the aforesaid criminal charges still pending against him for offenses committed
since March 2012, Applicant began working part time as a cashier at a sporting goods
store  in  September  2014.  He  was  terminated  in  November  2014  after  he  was  caught
stealing. He is ineligible for rehire. Applicant attempted to steal some food from the store
because he did not have enough money to pay for lunch. He was making “wrong decision
after wrong decision.” (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 46-47.) Applicant lived at home with his mother, and
she supported him financially when he was unemployed from November 2014 to January
2015. (GE 4.)
In January 2015, Applicant began working as a part-time cook at a pizza restaurant.
He left the job in March 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 46.) According to the employer, he is not eligible
for rehire because he was slow and did not follow instructions. Applicant held a second
part-time job at a fast-food establishment from February 2015 to February or March 2016,
when he resigned to spend time with  his child and focus on his training to become an
automotive technician, which he had started in July 2015. (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 50.)
Pursuant to a plea deal, on March 9, 2015, Applicant pleaded guilty to the March
2012 felony sale of a controlled substance and the April 2012 misdemeanor OUI (arrested
in December 2012). In exchange, the prosecutor entered nolle prosequi dispositions for the
April 2012 reckless driving infraction and all of the criminal charges filed against him since
July 2013.4 Applicant was sentenced for OUI to six months in jail (suspended); 18 months
of supervised probation, to be served concurrent with his probation for the felony drug
charge;  a  fine  of  $500;  and  100  hours  of  community  service.  For  the  felony  sale  of  a
controlled substance, he was sentenced to five years in jail, suspended; three years of
supervised  probation;  and  50  hours  of  community  service.  (GEs  1,  3-4;  Tr.  67-70.)  In
approximately May 2015, Applicant cut his ties with those friends involved with marijuana.
(Tr. 33.)
3 During his subject interview in March 2017, Applicant inaccurately recalled the possession and drug sale
charges as occurring in September 2013. (GE 4.)
4 A nolle prosequi (shortened as “nolle” in the FBI record) is a formal entry on the record by a prosecutor by
which he or she declares that there will be no further prosecution.
Applicant was drug tested during his probation on a regular basis, and all of the
tests  were  negative.  (Tr.  70.)  He  was  also  required  to  complete  counseling  for  his
marijuana use and to complete an Ignition Interlock Device (IID) Program. Applicant had
substance abuse counseling from  April 2015 to July 2015, which he asserts “definitely
started to drive [him], wake [him] up a little bit in the right direction.” (Tr. 40-41.) On his
completion of the IID program on September 26, 2016, the interlock device was removed
from his vehicle. He successfully completed his probations for the OUI on September 9,
2016, and for the felony sale of a controlled substance on March 9, 2018. (GEs 1, 3-4; AEs
B-C.)
As part of his employment application to work for his defense-contractor employer,
Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86) on October 29, 2015. He disclosed his arrest record; his use of marijuana
(“Smoked a blunt once a day”) from June 2010 to June 2014; his sales of marijuana to his
friends once or twice a week from May 2012 to June 2014 “due to the surroundings in
which  the  substance  brought  upon  [him];”  and  his  completion  of  counseling  for  his
marijuana use in 2012 and 2015. He denied any intention to use marijuana in the future for
the following reason:
Marijuana has changed my life in a very negative way. Bad characteristics
had been introduced and held onto, through this substance. Through me
quitting this substance I’m more motivated and ready to pursue my career
and maintain a happy standard of living. (GE 1.)
In July 2016, Applicant earned his automotive technician certificate. (GE 4; Tr. 20.)
He has since worked in the automotive industry, primarily in sales, without any adverse
incidents. (GEs 1, 4.)
On March 2, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant discussed his criminal charges, his
marijuana use, his alcohol use, and his involuntary termination from some previous jobs.
He indicated that the date of his last use of marijuana was accurately reported on his SF
86 and that he was no longer associating with any known illegal drug users. About his
alcohol use, he indicated that his drinking had decreased since early 2015 to once a month
and not to intoxication. He admitted that he drank to intoxication once a week until early
2015. He denied any intention to use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future. He
did not expect his drinking habit to change in the future. (GE 4.)
On September 20, 2017, Applicant responded to interrogatories from the DOD CAF
concerning his illegal drug use. He indicated that he had used cannabis a total of 20 times
in 2011, 2012, and 2014. He responded affirmatively to an inquiry concerning whether he
had ever purchased, sold, transported, or manufactured the drug. He also listed a one-time
use of Xanax in 2015, which was apparently obtained from his mother-in-law who has a
prescription. He was working and going to school and used it as a sleep aid. (Tr. 41-42.)
He denied any use of marijuana since his arrest in March 2014.5 Applicant indicated that
5 Applicant disclosed discrepantly on his SF 86 that he used marijuana (“smoked a blunt once a day”) to June
he did not have any illegal drugs or paraphernalia in his possession and that he had no
current association with any illegal drug users.  He also responded “Yes” to whether he had
ever participated in any drug or alcohol rehabilitation program and disclosed that he had
inpatient therapeutic meetings from March 2015 to June 2015. (GE 2.)
At his hearing, Applicant testified that he has put his past behind him and wanted
the opportunity to work for the defense contractor that is sponsoring him for a clearance.
(Tr. 24-25.) He denies any marijuana use since June 2014 and any current association with
illegal drug users. He spends his time outside of work with his fiancée and their daughter.
He and his fiancée began dating around the time of his last arrest in 2014, and they are
currently cohabitants. (Tr. 32, 73.) His fiancée works as a dental assistant. (Tr. 32-33.) He
attributes his turnaround to his probation officer, who became a mentor to him. (Tr. 72.)
