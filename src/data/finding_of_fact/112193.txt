Applicant admitted that she failed to timely file her federal and state income tax
returns for tax years 2012 through 2015. (SOR ¶ 1.a) She denied the remaining seven
SOR  allegations  (¶¶  1.b  through  1.h),  claiming  that  she  had  either  paid  or  disputed
them. Her SOR admission, and those at the hearing, are incorporated herein as findings
of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional
findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  41-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  She  received  an
associate’s  degree  in  2003,  and  has  completed  several  technical  certifications
thereafter.  She  married  in  2002  and  divorced  in  2006.  She  has  two  children,  ages  16
and 4. She receives $1,800 a month in child support.
Applicant has worked for many federal contractors from 2004 to present, except
for a short period of unemployment between July 2008 and August 2008. She also was
laid  off  in  October  2015,  and  worked  as  an  independent  contractor  for  federal
contractors  between  October  2015  and  May  2016.  She  received  eligibility  for  a  secret
clearance in 2006, which has been continued to present without any issues or concerns,
except for those in the SOR. Her current employer hired Applicant in May 2016.
In  her  response  to  Section  26  (Financial  Record)  of  her  2016  SCA,  Applicant
disclosed  financial  problems,  which  included  her  failure  to  timely  file  her  federal  and
state tax  returns for  tax  years  2012  through 2014,  a  state  tax  lien filed  against  her for
her  2012  unpaid  taxes,  and  several  medical  and  consumer  accounts  that  were
delinquent or in collection.
Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  her  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for  tax
years 2012 through 2017. Specifically, she filed her 2012 and 2013 income tax returns
in 2017; and filed her federal and state 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 income tax returns
in  2019.  According  to  her  income  tax  returns,  Applicant  owes  $3,217  in  taxes  for  tax
year  2012.  The  IRS  denied  her  refund  of  $1,755  for  tax  year  2013  because  she  filed
more than three years late. She owed no taxes for tax year 2014, but she owed $573 for
tax year 2015. For tax year 2016, she owed $11,314 in taxes; and she owed no taxes
for tax year 2017. (See AEs 1, 2, 3, 10(a) and 10(b), and documents submitted with her
SOR answer.)
Applicant  testified  that  she  agreed  with  her  state  tax  authorities  to  pay  $350  a
month  until  the  state  determines  her  balance.  Any  overpayments  she  makes  will  be
refunded. She is waiting for the IRS to provide her with a final balance.
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.f alleged debts in collection for telecommunications providers.
Applicant disputed both accounts, but then paid SOR ¶ 1.f in January 2019. (AE 6) The
remaining  SOR  allegations  (¶¶  1.c  through  1.e,  1.g,  and  1.h)  alleged  small  medical
debts, likely for unpaid insurance co-payments. Applicant paid SOR ¶ 1.h in April 2018.
(AE  8) She  testified  that  she either  paid  or disputed  the  remaining debts  because  she
could not identify the creditor. Considering the evidence as a whole, I resolve SOR ¶¶
1.b through 1.h for Applicant.
Applicant  testified  that  she  prepared  and  filed  all  her  income  tax  returns  before
2012.  She  failed  to  file  her  2012  tax  return  because  of  complications  resulting  from
multiple states assessing income taxes against her. She was a stay-at-home employee
with  work  connections  to  three  different  states.  She  did  not  know  how  to  file  her  tax
returns and procrastinated doing so. (Tr. 72) Applicant visited an IRS office in 2017, and
they  advised  her  they  were  not  interested  in  her  2012  income  tax  returns,  but  on  her
more  recent  delinquent  returns.  She  retained  an  accountant  to  help  her  file  her
delinquent income tax returns in 2017.
Concerning her failure to timely file her 2013, 2014, and 2015 income tax returns,
Applicant  stated  that  she  was  under  the  mistaken  belief  that  if  she  paid  her  taxes  up-
front (by automatic pay deductions), she would not have any problems if she were to file
her  income  tax  returns  late.  She noted  that after  her  uncle,  an attorney,  corrected her
mistaken belief, she has been making every effort to file her income tax returns as soon
as  possible.  Applicant  believes  that  she  has  been  open  and  forthcoming  during  the
clearance process about not filing her tax returns. She testified that she takes her duties
and clearance responsibilities seriously.
The  filing  of  Applicant’s  income  tax  return  for  year  2016  was  complicated
because  she  was  working  as  an  independent  contractor  and  was  missing  documents
(bank  statements  and  information  from  her  business  accounts).  Her  business  failed
when she got sick in 2017, and she claimed not having access to her business records
and accounts.
Applicant  noted  that  her  efforts  to  file  her  delinquent  income  taxes  were
hampered  by  her  recent  medical  problems.  In  about  September  2017,  she  was
diagnosed with Cushing’s disease. The day before her operation for Cushing’s disease,
she was diagnosed also with breast cancer. As a result, she underwent two operations
and was incapacitated and unable to work for about seven months. During that period,
she was unable to make any progress filing her delinquent tax returns.
Applicant expressed sincere remorse for not filing her income tax returns on time.
She claimed that she has learned a hard lesson and promised to timely file her income
tax  returns  and to  pay  her  taxes  in  the future. She  is  very  concerned  about  losing her
clearance  and  her  job  because  she  is  the  sole  provider  for  her  children  and  she  has
serious ongoing medical problems. Applicant’s 2016 income tax returns shows that her
income was $64,587; and for tax year 2017 her income was $84,657. (AE 10(b), AE 3)
