Applicant is a 54-year-old configuration and data manager who has been in that
particular  position  for  two  years,  and  with  the  same  entity  for  13  years.  She  receives
positive  appraisals  annually  and  earns  approximately  $135,000  a  year.  She  has
supported the military in some capacity since she was about 18 years old, and earned
an income since she was 13 years old. She earned a high school diploma and attended
some college. Her husband recently began a job as a bus driver after being let go from
a  transit  agency,  where  he  earned  about  $55,000.  He  accepted  that  job,  which  pays
$40,000  a  year,  after  being  unemployed  from  May  2018  to  August  2018.  The  couple
has a teenage son. Applicant is highly community-minded and devoted to this country.
Applicant’s  financial  problems  began  when  her  husband  was  subject  to  a
corporate  downsizing  maneuver  in  October  2011,  reducing  their  joint  income  by
$55,000.  He  remained  unemployed  until  December  2012,  leaving  the  entire  burden  of
marital bills, child-rearing, and mortgage on Applicant alone. Since that time, Applicant
has received no monetary assistance from her husband, although he currently pays for
their  child’s  private  school  tuition.  Financially  maintaining  their  family  of  three  on  her
salary alone, currently amounting to about $135,000, has been “very hard.” (Tr. 25) She
admits her financial situation is “a mess.” (Tr. 45). She recently started a part-time job to
supplement  her  income.  (Tr.  46)  Applicant  has  received  financial  counseling.  She
concedes she did not act as quickly on her debts as she should have. (Tr. 45-46)
At  issue  in  the  SOR  are  15  delinquent  debts  (1.a-1.o).  The  debt  at  1.a  is  a
mortgage  past  due  in  the  amount  of  approximately  $7,019.  This  situation  has  been
rectified and the Applicant is now current on that account. (Ex. K; Tr. 26)
The  debts noted  in  the  SOR  at  1.b-1o  consist  primarily  of  credit  card  balances,
amounting  to  about  $81,000,  plus  the  debts  at  1.l  (personal  loan  for  $7,178)  and  1.o
(time share-related judgment for $995 on a share acquired in 2011). In the past, only a
smattering  of  payments  was  ever  applied  to  these  debts.  She  acquired  so  much
delinquent  credit  card  debt  because  she  expected  her  husband  to  contribute  more  to
the family  coffers,  a dilemma dating  back  to 2008.  (Tr.  27)  At  that point,  she  only  had
one credit card. Doing her best, working hard, and applying her bonuses, however, did
not help. She relied increasingly on payday loans then credit cards. (Tr. 27, 35)
In  September  2018,  Applicant  filed  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  protection,  a
solution she had hoped to avoid. (Ex. N) She had previously filed for bankruptcy around
2004. (Tr. 32) Applicant recently submitted a proposed payment plan under which she
would pay $100 a month for two months, then pay $500 per month for 58 months. At the
time of the hearing, her proposal was pending approval. In the bankruptcy paperwork, at
Schedule J, Applicant calculated her monthly net income. (Ex. N; Tr. 36-37) It resulted
in  a  negative  net  monthly  remainder.  She  hopes  to  ameliorate  this  situation  with  a
home-based part-time job and the completion of monthly payments on her car ($435).
After  the  hearing,  Applicant  provided  documentary  evidence  that  two  payments
of  $100  were  submitted  to  her  bankruptcy  trustee  in  October  2018,  scheduled  for
deposit  in  October  and  November  2018,  respectively.  She  provided  a  screen  shot
indicating  the  one  check  was  posted  in  October  2018.  It  is  unclear  whether  her
proposed payment plan has been formally implemented by the bankruptcy court.
