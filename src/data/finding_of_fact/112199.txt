The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of November 14, 2017, Applicant owed
a single, charged-off debt for $68,240 (SOR ¶ 1.a). When Applicant answered the SOR,
she admitted the debt without explanation. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and
transcript, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 25 years old and unmarried. She is the second of six children born to
immigrant parents. (GE 1; Tr. 43-44, 80.) Two of Applicant’s sisters (both younger) were in
college as of March 2018. (Tr. 44, 87.) Applicant has been cohabiting with her boyfriend in
his apartment since July 2016. (GE 5; Tr. 17-18, 51.)
Applicant has worked for a defense contractor since June 2016. She started as a
learner  in  her  trade  and  quickly  progressed  through  six  steps.  With  the  approval  of
management,  she  was  selected  for  a  leadership  position  in  her group  and  has  added
responsibilities in that regard. In 2018, she was promoted to a draftsman position. As of
March 2018, Applicant was working 45 to 50 hours per week and sometimes 55 hours per
week. Applicant held a company-issued clearance that was withdrawn on issuance of the
SOR. Because Applicant is a valued employee, her supervisor found work for her that
currently does not require a security clearance. (Tr. 19-23.)
Applicant graduated from high school in 2010. (Tr. 30, 50.) In August 2010, she
matriculated in a private university at a cost of approximately $44,000 annually, inclusive of
room and board and books. Applicant obtained a private student loan for $43,990 (SOR ¶
1.a) to pay for her first year of college. She was contractually liable on the loan but signed
with the understanding from her parents that they would repay most of the loan for her.1
(GE 2; Tr. 30-31, 43, 46, 58.) Applicant’s father testified that he and his spouse expected to
help their daughter repay the loan. He had worked in construction part time while being
1 Applicant indicated during her May 18, 2017 subject interview that her father had co-signed on the loan. (GE
5.) Her father testified that he co-signed for the loan. (Tr. 93.) Available credit information indicates that the
account was opened individually. (GE 3.)
employed as a police officer for many years. After he retired from the police force in 2006,
he  began  working  in  construction  full  time.  (Tr.  81.)  His  income  from  the  construction
business  fluctuated. He earned $400,000 annually in 2007 and 2009 and $200,000 in
2012. He did not anticipate there would be a problem helping Applicant financially. (Tr. 94-
97.)
To reduce her college expenses, Applicant transferred to her state university at the
start  of  her  sophomore  year.2  She  lived  on  campus,  but  the  move  still  saved  her
approximately $20,000 a year. (Tr. 32-33, 47-48.) Applicant obtained federal student loans
for college starting in August 2011 that totaled $24,501. For her junior year, she and her
father jointly obtained a private student loan for $14,062 from lender X in October 2012.
(GE 3.) A Dean’s List student at the university,  Applicant was forced to withdraw  from
college in December 2013 when her application for a student loan for her final semester
was denied. Applicant’s father was to be a co-signer on that loan, but  his construction
business was not doing very well. (Tr. 33-35, 56-58.) Applicant’s father testified that his
then business partner in 2012 embezzled approximately $650,000 from the business and
took off for parts unknown. (Tr. 88.) Applicant’s father was left holding the notes on several
properties owned jointly by him and his former business partner. (Tr. 89, 98.) He sold one
of  the  properties  at  a  loss,  but  has  continued  to  incur  expenses  (insurance,  mortgage
payments, taxes, maintenance) for other properties.3 (Tr. 90.) After he paid off debts and
expenses for the properties, he cleared about $20,000 to $30,000 in income. (Tr. 91.) It
has been a financial struggle since then, even with his police retirement pay of $49,250
annually. (Tr. 94-96.)
Applicant had a part-time job at a fast-food restaurant since June 2008, but her
income was not enough to cover the costs of college. (GEs 1, 5.) After she left college, in
addition to her student loan debts, Applicant owed $6,200 to the university in unpaid tuition
and other expenses. (GEs 1, 5.) Applicant lived at home with her parents and siblings. She
worked as many hours as she could at the fast-food restaurant. She became a full-time
employee during her last year on the job. (Tr. 52.) She held a second part-time job at night
with a competitor from January 2015 to May 2015. In August 2015, she moved into her
own apartment and obtained a car loan of $16,326 for a 2011 model-year vehicle. (GEs 1,
3, 5; Tr. 61.)
Applicant’s $6,200 debt with the university was placed for collection in the summer
of 2014. In response to a collection letter, Applicant paid $100 a month toward the debt by
automatic deduction from her bank account. After about a year, her debt was transferred to
another collection entity. Applicant failed to notice that the withdrawals for the debt had
ceased. In February 2016, she received a notice for collection of the $4,700 balance. She
2 Applicant had applied to the university while she was finishing high school, but she was not accepted. (Tr. 59-
60.)
3 Applicant’s father testified that he still has income property purchased by the business consisting of a six-
family  home,  a  single-family  house,  a  duplex,  and  42  acres of undeveloped land. He managed to sell a
property at a loss, but he lost another to foreclosure. (Tr. 101-102.)
made a lump-sum payment to fully satisfy the debt in February 2016 with funds provided by
her parents. (GEs 1, 5.)
When her student loan that she obtained at age 18 for her freshman year of college
(SOR ¶ 1.a) came out of deferment, Applicant was required to pay $741 a month, which
she could not afford on her income of $13.50 an hour from the fast-food restaurant. (Tr.
51.) Applicant’s account was closed in February 2015 and placed for collection. She made
a $300 payment in April 2015,4 but while her payment was accepted, she was told that her
monthly obligation had increased to $790. As of February 2016, she owed a charged-off
balance of $68,240. The creditor wrote off the balance to profit and loss.5 (GE 5; Tr. 38.)
Her  other  private  student  loan  came  out  of  deferment  in  July  2014  and  has  not  been
delinquent. Applicant recalls making payments toward that loan in 2015. (Tr. 33.) As of July
2017, her monthly payment was approximately $212 on a balance of $11,804. (GE 3.) Her
consolidated federal student loan balance of $23,772 was reportedly in deferment as of
March 2016. (GE 2.) The balance of her consolidated federal student loans was $24,925
as of June 2017. (GE 3.)
Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National
Security  Positions  (SF  86)  on  March  21,  2016.  She  listed  two  routine  delinquencies,
consisting of her debt with the university, which she paid off in February 2016, and the
charged-off private student loan alleged in the SOR. She explained that her student loan
had been recently charged off because she could not afford the $790 monthly payments
demanded by the creditor. (GE 1.) In early June 2016, Applicant left her position as an
assistant manager for the fast-food restaurant to work for her current employer, a defense
contractor, at $15 an hour. (Tr. 52, 78.)
On May 18, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant indicated that she had made only one
$300 payment on a student loan that had been charged off. She made no further payments
because the creditor was not willing to accept a smaller monthly payment that she could
afford.  Applicant  added  that  she  had  obtained  her  credit  report  in  March  2016,  which
showed the account as charged off and closed. She assumed that she no longer had to
pay  the  debt.  She  had  not  been  contacted  about  the  debt  in  over  a  year.  Applicant
expressed her intention to follow up with the lender to ensure that she no longer owes on
the account. If she discovers she is still responsible for repayment, she is willing to make
$200 to $300 monthly payments until it is satisfied in full. She indicated that she is able to
pay her other bills on her income from her defense-contractor employment. She did not
intend to fall behind on any accounts in the future or to borrow more money than she can
afford to repay. Applicant presented extracts from an updated credit report showing that
4 Applicant speculated that she may have paid the $300 in October 2014. (Tr. 66.) Available credit information
shows a date of last payment in April 2015. (GE 5.)
5 As of May 2017, TransUnion was reporting a date of February 28, 2015, for closure of her account and a last
payment on the account of April 17, 2015. Equifax was reporting the debt as in collection/charge off as of
February 2015. (GE 5.) The debt was reported in collection for $68,240 as of March 2016, but also as a
charge off. (GE 2.)
she was making timely payments of $335 per month on her car loan and $212 on her
private student loan with lender X. (GE 5.)
Applicant is paying her car loan, her consolidated federal student loans, and her
student  loan  with  lender  X  on  time.  Her  federal  student  loans  (subsidized  and
unsubsidized)  have  been  in  a  debt  relief  program  since  2016  where  her repayment  is
based on her income. She is currently paying $251 per month toward her federal student-
loan debt and approximately $212 per month toward her private student loan with lender X.
(AE C; Tr. 35-37, 50, 71.)
In October or November 2017, Applicant  contacted the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.a to
possibly arrange for repayment of her charged-off student loan. (Tr. 66-67.) She was given
three options to repay the balance: $1,100 a month until fully satisfied; five years of equal
monthly payments toward a reduced settlement of $64,000; or $680 a month for the first
three months and then equal monthly payments toward the remaining balance over the
next 4.75 years. Applicant informed the creditor that she could not afford the payments, but
that  she  could  pay  $200  a  month  until  her  other  student  loans  and  car  payment  are
satisfied.  The  creditor  refused  her  counteroffer.  (Tr.  40-41;  Tr.  66.)  Applicant  did  not
consider sending any money to the creditor at that time because she “didn’t think it would
do anything.” (Tr. 62.) In early March 2018, Applicant sent the creditor a $200 payment that
has not been cashed. The SOR was a factor in her deciding to send the payment. (Tr. 63.)
She has not received a 1099-C Cancellation of Debt form from the creditor, but interest is
no longer accruing on the debt. (GE 4; Tr. 41-42, 68.) If the creditor accepts the payment,
she intends to continue repayment at $200 a month. (Tr. 42.) When her vehicle loan is paid
off  in  2021,  she  will increase her payment on the  defaulted student loan by  $335 (the
amount of her car payment). In 2023, her private student loan with lender X will be paid off,
so she can put another $215 each month toward the defaulted student loan. (Tr. 49.)
Applicant’s cohabitant boyfriend is a registered nurse. He is on the lease for their
apartment  and  pays  the  rent  of  $800  a  month.  (Tr.  29,  50,  70.)  Applicant  pays  the
electricity,  cable,  and  telephone bills, which totaled approximately $413 a month as of
March 2018. (AE A; Tr. 29.) Her base hourly wage is now $19.69. (AE B; Tr. 25.) After
paying  her  expenses  and  her  student  loans,  including  the  $200  toward  the  defaulted
student loan, she is left with $38 in net discretionary monthly income based on a 40-hour
work week. However, because of her routine overtime averaging 45 to 55 hours a week,
she nets about $560 a month. She was paid a $500 bonus in January 2018.  (AE A.) She
has approximately $1,000 in combined checking and savings deposits. (Tr. 69.) She has
had no financial counseling. (Tr. 70-71.)
Applicant is only two classes short of earning her bachelor’s degree. She plans to
complete her degree when she can afford to return to school. (Tr. 35, 54.)
Applicant’s father cannot presently provide her any financial assistance. After his
former partner’s embezzlement, his spouse reorganized the articles and made herself 98%
owner of the business. (Tr. 91.) In the fall of 2017, his spouse abandoned their marriage.
Applicant’s father still has three children living at home.  He is currently helping his two
daughters in college with their educational expenses. (Tr. 103-104.)
Applicant’s  supervisor  described  Applicant  as  a  highly  reliable  and  exceptional
worker.  For  her  excellent  performance,  she  was  submitted  for  two  non-automatic
progressions in pay and approved as a working leader or “tutor.” As a “tutor,” Applicant acts
as  a  resource  helping  with  training,  mentoring,  process  improvement,  and  production
support.  In  her  supervisor’s  opinion,  Applicant  “continues  to  grow  and  improve  at  an
exponential rate.” (AE D.)
