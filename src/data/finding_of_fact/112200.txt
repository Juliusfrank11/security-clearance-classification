After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 51 years old and a college graduate. He and his spouse married in May
1991, and they have two sons, now ages 21 and 24. For most of their marriage, Applicant’s
spouse did not work outside the home. Applicant has worked as a staff scientist with his
current employer since May 2011. He holds a secret clearance that was granted to him in
September 2011. (GEs 1-2; AE L; Tr. 44-48.)
Applicant worked as a reliability engineer and scientist for a company from July
2000 to April 2011, when he was laid off. (GE 1; AE L.) He was given severance pay of
$20,000, but he lost a job paying him $105,000 a year, and his spouse was unemployed. In
May  2011,  Applicant  began  working  for  his  current  employer  at  an  annual  salary  of
$79,000. (GE 2; Tr. 40, 48.)
Applicant cashed in his retirement account of $50,000 in 2012, and he used those
funds to pay for his older son’s college expenses. That premature withdrawal of retirement
assets had income tax implications. (GE 2; Tr. 67.)
Applicant’s spouse handled the family’s finances, including filing their income tax
returns. Applicant and his spouse prepared their tax returns, using tax software purchased
online. (GE 2; Tr. 32, 52.) In 2015 or 2016, they were notified by the IRS that they owed
delinquent income taxes for tax year 2012.1 Applicant checked his computer and could find
no record of their 2012 tax returns. He assumed that the returns had been filed, and that
he was a victim of computer hacking or a scam. (GE 2; Tr. 56-57.) He later learned that
neither the IRS nor the state had any record of them filing a return for 2012. Substitute
returns were filed by the IRS and state, and tax liabilities were assessed.2 (Tr. 36, 57.)
Applicant does not now know for certain whether their tax return for 2012 was filed as
required by law. (Tr. 52.)
Concerned that he might be the victim of identity theft, Applicant obtained a copy of
his credit report in 2016, which revealed that some of his consumer credit accounts were
seriously delinquent. His spouse had used his credit cards and hidden from him that she
was not making payments. (GEs 1, 3.)
On  July  15,  2016,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to the financial record
inquiries, Applicant responded affirmatively to the following question: “In the past seven
(7) years have you failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law
or ordinance?” Applicant indicated that he had recently discovered that he owed $23,000 in
federal and state income taxes from 2012, which he believed to be inaccurate. He added
that he had retained a lawyer to investigate the error,3 and expressed his concern that
1 The evidentiary record contains discrepant debts about when and how Applicant was notified of his tax
problems for 2012. He told an investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in June 2017 that
he received notification from the IRS in June 2015 that he owed $3,851 to the IRS for tax year 2012. (GE 2.)
At his hearing, he testified that he learned he had a potential tax issue in 2016 when he obtained his credit
report that listed his tax liabilities. (Tr. 53-54.)
2 As of April 30, 2018, the IRS was reporting an outstanding tax liability of $18,865 for tax year 2012.  There is
no record in evidence showing the state tax liability. SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a state tax debt of $3,934 for 2012.
Applicant disputed the debt in November 2017. (GE 2.) His tax return prepared in March 2018 showed a state
underpayment for 2012 of $2,174. (AE J.)
3 Applicant named the attorney and provided her contact information on his SF 86, and he indicated during a
June 2017 interview with an OPM investigator that he immediately contacted the tax attorneys, to whom he
paid $500 upfront to resolve the issue. (GE 2.) At his hearing, he submitted an email (GE G) of October 27,
2016, from an attorney with a tax relief firm of a different name and contact information. The attorney indicated
“someone has stolen [his] information and claiming [sic] extra income in an attempt to get
money.”  In  response  to  questions  involving  delinquency  involving  routine  accounts,
Applicant listed three credit card debts, of $2,944 (SOR ¶ 1.d), $1,486 (SOR ¶ 1.e), and
$585 (SOR ¶ 1.1.h), and added that he was making monthly payments to resolve them. He
provided the following reason for the credit card debts:
When  the  tax  discrepancy  surfaced  I  ran  a  credit  report  and  discovered
several unresolved credit card problems. Since my wife manages our home
finances  I  spoke  with  her  regarding  the  credit  card  issues.  She
acknowledged that they were legitimate and had attempted to conceal them
from me.
Applicant listed two other debts on his SF 86: a $14,000 car loan debt that was paid
off with funds borrowed from his parents, and a $10,000 student loan obtained for his older
son’s education. The loan came out of deferment when his son had to suspend his studies
for medical reasons. (GE 1.) Neither of those debts was alleged in the SOR. Available
credit information shows that the student loan was delinquent in February 2015, October
2015, and November 2015.  (GE 4.)   The issue was resolved by the loan again being
deferred. (GE 1.) The car loan was obtained in October 2011 for $26,759. Payments were
current  until  the  spring  of  2014,  and  the  loan  was  charged  off  in  the  fall  of  2014  for
$14,244. Applicant borrowed funds from his parents and paid off the loan.4 (GE 3.)
Available  credit  reports  (GEs  3-4)  and  payment  records  reflect  the  following
consumer credit delinquencies and some payments toward the debts.
Charged-off credit card for $1,894 (SOR ¶ 1.d)
Applicant’s credit card account, which he opened in July 2006, was charged off and
closed in 2014 for nonpayment. In approximately October 2016, Applicant began repaying
the debt at $75 per month. As of November 2016, the past-due balance was $2,644. He
that he had just received Applicant’s inquiry and been assigned to his case. At his hearing, Applicant testified
that the attorney he listed on his SF 86 was not accurate, and he found out that he had retained the services of
the company in AE G. (Tr. 54-55.) Applicant provided no evidence linking the two attorneys or tax firms. Given
his history of switching tax relief firms, he may have retained a new tax firm. He presented no documentation
of payment to the attorney listed on his SF 86 or to the tax firm identified in AE G. He testified that the tax firm
in AE G was the only tax relief company that had contacted the IRS and state tax authority on his behalf. (Tr.
60.)
4 Applicant indicated on his SF 86 that he and his spouse had difficulty with the car manufacturer’s financing
and their online electronic payment tools. (GE 1.) During his subject interview (GE 2) and at his hearing (Tr.
65), he explained that he had traded in a hybrid vehicle in October 2011 for his current car. In the fall of 2014,
he received a call indicating that he was behind four months on his payments for the loan for the hybrid vehicle
that he had not owned for two years. Available credit reports show that Applicant obtained a vehicle loan for
$24,554 that was paid off and closed in November 2011. (GE 3.) That loan was likely for the hybrid. The
evidence suggests a problem with Applicant’s payments for his current vehicle. Although the delinquency was
not  alleged,  it  is  relevant  to assessing Applicant’s understanding of his finances and whether he  can be
counted on to pay his debt obligations going forward.
continued to make the payments to reduce the balance to $1,894 as of September 2017.
After his May 2018 payment, the balance was $1,369. (GEs 1-4; AE D; Tr. 28.)
Collection debt for $1,069 (SOR ¶ 1.e)
Applicant opened a credit card account with a retail clothing company in November
2008. In February 2015, a past-due balance of $1,486 was placed with a collection entity
after no payments since November 2013. In July 2016, Applicant contacted the creditor
and began repaying the debt under terms acceptable to his creditor. During a June 2017
interview with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator, Applicant indicated
that he had arranged to make 50 payments of $29.71 each starting in July 2016. As of
September 2017, the balance was $1,069. After a $30 payment in April 2018, he owed
$856 on the account. (GEs 2-4; AE B; Tr. 25.)
Past-due utility debt for $864 (SOR ¶ 1.f)
In  March  2017,  Applicant’s  power  supplier  placed  an  $864  debt  for  collection.
Applicant arranged to make an extra payment each month toward the delinquency with his
regular bill payment. As of late March 2018, the balance under the repayment agreement
was $955. (GE 4; AE F; Tr. 29.)
Collection debt for $626 (SOR ¶ 1.g)
In September 2012, Applicant opened a credit card account with a retailer. As of
April 2014, his account was charged off and in collection for $626 due to no payments
since  September  2013.  Applicant  asserts  that  the  $75  monthly  payment  to  the  entity
collecting  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.d  also  covers  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.g.  (GE  2;  Tr.  28.)
However, AE D shows that the full $75 payment is being credited toward the account in
SOR ¶ 1.a. Applicant presented no documentation showing progress toward resolving the
debt in SOR ¶ 1.g, which had been charged off to profit and loss by the creditor. (GE 3.)
Collection debt for $235 (SOR ¶ 1.h)
In September 2015, a delinquent credit card balance of $585 for a computer was
placed for collection after inactivity since September 2014. Applicant began repaying the
debt at $25 a month in July 2016. He made extra payments when he could, and as of
September 2017, the balance was $235. As of late April 2018, the outstanding balance
was $34. (GEs 1-4; AE C.)
Collection debt for $210 (SOR ¶ 1.i)
Applicant obtained a retail charge card in November 2008. His account was charged
off and placed for collection for $420 due to nonpayment since September 2013. As of
September 2017, the account had a past-due balance of $210. The debt was fully satisfied
with a final payment of $70 received by the creditor on December 1, 2017. (GEs 3-4; AE A;
Tr. 24.)
On June 23, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator about the
delinquent accounts on his credit report and about his tax issues for 2012. He explained
that he did not realize he had any financial problems until he received a letter from the IRS
in June 2015 stating that he owed $3,851 after an audit of his 2012 income tax return.5 He
did not understand why he owed taxes, and so he paid a $500 fee to a tax attorney to
resolve the issue with the IRS and also any state tax issue for tax year 2012. He denied
receiving any notification from the state of a tax liability for 2012. After receiving notice of
the federal taxes, he obtained his credit report in 2016 and learned that  several of his
accounts were past-due. He allowed his spouse to use his credit cards, and she failed to
adjust her spending in line with his lower salary. He did not dispute the debts with the
exception of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.i, which he did not recognize at the time. He indicated that
he  immediately  contacted  his  creditors  and  made  repayment  arrangements.  Applicant
added that he and his spouse had taken several steps to resolve cash-flow issues and
obtain the funds to pay off his past-due debts. They reduced their rent from $1,878 to
$1,500 a month and lowered their utility costs by moving to a smaller apartment in June
2016.  With  a  change  in  cable  television  and Internet plans, they lowered that monthly
expense by $100 to $248. Additionally, his spouse obtained employment at an arcade that
netted income of $1,000 a month. They had $5,940 in monthly net household income to
pay expenses totaling $4,925, which did not include any payments to the IRS or on the
student loan obtained by Applicant for their older son’s education. (GE 2.)
After about a year, the tax firm wanted another $800 from Applicant to resolve his
tax issues. Dissatisfied with the firm because of a lack of communication from the firm,
Applicant retained a local tax resolution entity that he found by a Google search. (Tr. 61.)
He  paid  the  company’s  $2,500  retainer  fee  over  time.  He  made  a  $625  payment  in
November 2017 to the company. (AE H; Tr. 33-34, 61.)
On November 1, 2017, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories. He denied
that he had failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for 2012 on time, and he
denied  the  balances  claimed  by  the  IRS  ($20,575)  and  the  state  ($3,934).  Applicant
provided  a  document  showing  that  he  had  purchased  online  tax  software  in  2013  to
prepare his 2012 tax returns and explained in part:
Since I started working I have always claimed zero dependents in my tax
paperwork so that I would always receive tax money back. Typically this was
in  the  three  thousand  dollar  range  with  the  Federal  and  state  combined.
When I learned in 2016 that there was some sort of issue I went to my home
computer to obtain the 2012 tax information and it was the only year missing
from my computer. I obtained a tax specialist online to rectify the situation. I
paid the specialist their fee and they never seem to communicate what they
were doing or had done for the money I provided. I ended up changing to a
local law firm who deals with these issues. . . . (GE 2.)
5 The amount of federal tax liability is discrepant with what he reported on his SF 86, and with his testimony at
his hearing. When asked how he came up with the $23,000, he responded that he could not recall exactly the
source, although it was possibly the credit report, and that he “just added state and federal together.” (Tr. 55.)
He could not recall the source of the $3,851 figure provided during his interview. (Tr. 60.)
For several months, the tax resolution firm claimed that it could clear up Applicant’s
tax  issues  in  weeks.  In  approximately  early  March  2018,  the  state  filed  a  lien  against
Applicant’s bank account for past-due state taxes for 2012 (allegedly $3,934 as of August
2017).  It  became  clear  to  Applicant  that  the  tax  resolution  company  had  made  little
progress  on his behalf.  On the suggestion of one of his co-workers, Applicant  and his
spouse then had their joint federal and state income tax returns for 2012 prepared by a
professional tax service. Three days later, and after paying a fee of $275, their tax returns
for 2012 were completed and filed on March 16, 2018. They owed $949 to the IRS and
$2,174 to the state for tax year 2012. (AE J; Tr. 34-38, 58, 61-64.)
After  reviewing  the  return  submitted  in  March  2018,  the  IRS  recalculated  their
federal income taxes for 2012, and instead of owing a balance of $18,865 Applicant and
his  spouse  were  entitled  to  a  refund  of  $1,361.  (AE  I.)  The  state  suspended  the  levy
against his bank account on receiving their state tax return but seized their federal refund
for $1,361. As of Applicant’s hearing in May 2018, the state was still assessing their tax
liability for tax year 2012. (Tr. 35-38, 72.)
Applicant  has  been  handling  the  household  finances  since  mid-2016,  when  he
learned of his consumer credit delinquencies. (Tr. 40-41.) Applicant’s two sons currently
live at home. His younger son was attending college as of May 2018. The other son had
temporarily  withdrawn  from  school  to  pursue  an  entrepreneurial  venture  involving
purchasing items on sale from retailers and sending them to Amazon for online resale.
Applicant gave his son approximately $1,000 over time to facilitate this business venture.
(Tr. 68-69.) As of late April 2018, Applicant was making monthly payments of $167 toward
the student loan obtained for his older son’s education. The loan had a balance of $12,690.
(AE E; Tr. 29, 73.) His sons have student loans of their own for which Applicant has no
contractual liability. (Tr. 73.)
Applicant is paying his parents $300 a month toward the personal loan to pay off his
vehicle. The remaining balance is approximately $6,000. Applicant and his spouse have no
other vehicles. (Tr. 38, 65-66.) He intends to fully satisfy his outstanding debts. (Tr. 40.)
Applicant’s  annual  salary  is  currently  $92,000.  He  has  $1,200  in  the  bank,  but  no
retirement  funds.  (Tr.  48,  66.)  Applicant  is  currently  disputing  a  $27  PayPal  debt  in
collections that he did not authorize. He is working with his insurance company to resolve
an  outstanding  $199  medical  debt.  He  maintains  an  Excel  spreadsheet  to  track  the
household income and expenditures. (Tr. 48-51.)
At his annual performance review for the period from June 2017 through May 2017,
Applicant was given excellent to outstanding ratings. He consistently displayed a positive
attitude and willingness to do whatever was required by his team. (AE K.)
