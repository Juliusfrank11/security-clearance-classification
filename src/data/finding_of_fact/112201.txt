Applicant  disclosed  in  his  SCA  that  he  was  in  a  payment  plan  with  the  IRS  for
federal income taxes. (FORM Item 2.) The SOR alleges that Applicant owes $11,564 in
delinquent federal income taxes (SOR ¶ 1.a) and that he failed to timely file his federal
income tax return for tax year 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.b). In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he
admitted  both  allegations  with  explanations.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  in  my
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  52-year-old  security-systems  engineer  employed  by  defense
contractors  since  October  2012.  He  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  information
technology  security  in  January  2009  and  a  master’s  degree  in  information  security
assurance in January 2010. He has been employed as an adjunct professor at several
universities since February 2010. He married in September 1993 and has four children,
ages 23, 22, 17, and 16. He has held a security clearance since November 2012.
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he stated that his tax debt was due to “errors in
my  tax  filing.”  He  did  not  provide  any  further  details.  He  stated  that  he  was  making
payments as required on a payment plan for the tax debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. He did
not  provide  any  documentary  evidence  of  a  payment  plan  or  payments.  Department
Counsel requested that he provide a tax transcript for 2014 showing payments, but he
did not comply with the request. In Department Counsel’s submission, she pointed out
the absence of documentation to support Applicant’s statements.
In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he submitted a document reflecting that he
had made one $350 payment in May 2018 and five $200 payments from May through
September 2018 on a debt for tax year 2014. However, the document does not contain
any indicia that it was issued by the IRS. He did not submit any documentary evidence of
a payment agreement. He asserted that he also made $200 payments in June through
October 2018, but he submitted no documentation of these payments. He stated that he
had  reduced  his  indebtedness  to  the  IRS  from  $11,564  to  $7,005,  but  he  provided  no
documentation to support his statement.
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he stated that he believed that he electronically
filed his federal income tax return for tax year 2016, and that he had mailed a hard copy
of  the  2016  tax  return  to  the  IRS,  but  he  provided  no  documentation  to  support  his
statement. In his response to the FORM, he repeated his statement that he had filed his
2016 return, elaborating that his tax return was received by the IRS and was processed

on June 18, 2018. However, he did not submit any documentary evidence in his SOR
answer or response to the FORM showing that the 2016 return had been filed.
