Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  set  forth  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  through  1.d,  with
explanations. She denied SOR ¶ 1.a.
Guideline F – Financial Considerations
Applicant is 49 years old, married and has two adult children. (GX 1 at pages 5
and 18, and TR at page 16 lines 4~13.)
1.a.  Applicant  denies  that  she  has  a  Federal  tax  lien,  in  the  amount  of  about
$30,000, entered against her and her husband in February of 2015. She avers that, as
she now files separate tax returns from her husband, she is not responsible for his  tax
delinquencies.  (TR  at  page  16  line  14  to  page  21  line  20.)  However,  at  her  hearing
Applicant also acknowledged her responsibility, as they owed back taxes, in part, as a
result  of  their  2012  joint  tax  return filing.  (Id,  and  Response  at  page  6.) Applicant also
noted  in  her  Response  that  her  husband  had  intermittent  tax  levies  filed  against  his
separate  Federal  tax  returns.  (Response  at  pages  3  and  4.)  At  her  hearing,  Applicant
averred  that  she  would  submit  further  documentation  showing  that  her  spouse  is  now
paying $833, biweekly, to the Internal Revenue Service towards this tax lien. (TR at page
18  lines  1~18.)  Despite  having  more  than  five  months  to  submit  said  documentation,
Applicant  has  only  submitted  a  budget  showing  that  no  federal  taxes  are  being  paid.
(AppX E at page 1.) This allegation is found against Applicant.
1.b.~1.d.  Applicant admits that she is indebted to the Navy Federal Credit Union
for past-due debts totaling about $80,000. (TR at page  21 line 21 to page 26 line 19.)
Applicant  has  submitted  documentation  showing  she  has  begun  to  make  monthly
payments of $600 towards these admitted debts. (AppXs C and D.) I find she is making
a good-faith effort to address these credit union debts; and as such, these allegations are
found for Applicant.
