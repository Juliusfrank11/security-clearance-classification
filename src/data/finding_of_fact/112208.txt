Applicant is a 52-year-old software developer who is seeking a position of public
trust with his employer, a federal contractor, where he has worked full time since August
2015. He holds an Associate’s degree (in 2008), a Bachelor’s degree (in 2014), and is
working on his Master’s degree. Applicant earned his Associate’s degree using the GI Bill
and  his  Bachelor’s  degree  through  a  Veterans  Vocational  Rehabilitation  Program.
Applicant is twice married and twice divorced (1987 to 1996 and 2000 to 2016). He has
six children ranging in ages from 14 to 31, none of whom live with him. Applicant pays
about $1,500 per month in child support for the two children who are under age 18.
Applicant  served  in  the  U. S.  Navy  from 1987  to 1991,  when  he was  honorably
discharged.  In  October  2006,  he  became  disabled  as  a  result  of  service-connected
injuries.  In  about  2008,  Social  Security  (SS)  deemed  him  to  be  100%  disabled,  and
Applicant began receiving Social Security disability benefits. The Veterans Administration
(VA)  deemed  him  to  be  40%  disabled.  As  a  result  of  his  disability,  Applicant  was
unemployed  from  September  2006  until  August  2015.  The  disability,  the  resulting
unemployment, and lack of income caused his ‘financial life [to go] into default.” (GE 1;
Tr. 11-12, 17, 18-20, 60-61, 77-78, 83, 94.)
SOR alleges 20 delinquent debts totaling $43,947. The evidence pertaining to the
debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  is  summarized  below  and  is  gleaned  from  Applicant’s
admissions to the SOR, the parties’ exhibits, and Applicant’s hearing testimony.
SOR  ¶  1.a:  electric  utility  account  placed  for  collection  for  $589.  Applicant
claimed that he paid this account in a lump sum in 2016. He did not have any supporting
documentation at the hearing but said he could provide some. Applicant did not provide
such documentation post-hearing. (Tr. 21-23.)
SOR  ¶  1.b:  cell  phone  account  placed  for  collection  for  $387.  Applicant
claimed that he paid this account in 2015. He did not have any supporting documentation
at  the  hearing  but  said  he  could  provide  some.  Applicant  did  not  provide  such
documentation post-hearing. (Tr. 23-25.)
SOR  ¶  1.c:  medical  account  placed  for  collection  for  $302.  Post-hearing,
Applicant submitted documentation showing this account to be paid. (AE A.)
SOR ¶ 1.d: judgment on a credit union account for $9,422 filed in February
2011. This judgment was paid in March 2017. (Answer; Tr. 27-29.)
SOR ¶ 1.e: judgment on a rental account for $982 filed in September 2012.
Applicant  claimed  that  his  ex-wife  paid  this  judgment  and  that  he  would  try  to  get
supporting documentation from his ex-wife. Applicant did not provide such documentation
post-hearing. (Tr. 29-32.)
SOR  ¶  1.f:  past-due  university  account  placed  for  collection  for  $968.
Applicant  incurred  this  debt  in  2011  or  2012.    He  has  not  resolved  this  account  but
believes  that  it  should  have  been  covered  by  student  loans.  Applicant  did  not  provide
such documentation post-hearing. (Tr. 32-34, 36-37.)
SOR  ¶  1.g:  past-due  online  university  account  placed  for  collection  for
$4,210. Applicant will attempt to find documentation that this account should have been
covered  by  student  loans.  Applicant did  not  provide  such  documentation  post-hearing.
(Tr. 34-37.)
SOR ¶ 1.h: The Government moved to withdraw this allegation as a duplicate of
SOR ¶ 1.d. The motion was granted without objection. (Tr. 85-86.)
SOR ¶ 1.i: The Government moved to withdraw this allegation as a duplicate of
SOR ¶ 1.f. The motion was granted without objection. (Tr. 85-86.)
SOR ¶ 1.j: cell phone collection account place for collection for $394.  This
account was paid in December 2017. (Answer; Tr. 39-40.)
SOR ¶ 1.k:  account for a purchase of furniture placed in collection for $1,257.
Applicant  testified  that  he  made  a  $1,000  down  payment  to  the  original  creditor  and
monthly payments of about $100 totaling about $1,200. He was never given credit for the
down payment or the monthly payments. Applicant denied this allegation, because he is
in  an  adversarial  process  with  the  original  creditor.  SOR  ¶  1.s  is  owed  to  the  same
collection  agency  for  the  same  original  creditor  in  an  approximately  similar  amount
($1,995),  although  the  collection  account  numbers  are  different.  (GE  4,  pp.  13,  19.)
Applicant believes that those are duplicate accounts. (Tr. 40-44, 63-65.) The weight of
the evidence suggests that they are duplicates.
SOR  ¶  1.l:  account  for  an  electric  utility  placed  in  collection  for  $235.
Applicant resolved this account in November 2017. (AE B; Tr. 44-46.)
SOR ¶ 1.m: account for a broken lease placed for collection for $3,373.  At
the time, Applicant was having problems with his then wife, and he moved out and made
no further payments on the lease. Although he disputed this debt and had it removed from
his credit report, Applicant agrees that he still owes that debt and intends to pay it after
taking care of some of the larger debts. He has not, however, set up a payment plan. (Tr.
46-49.)
SOR ¶ 1.n: medical account placed for collection for $188. Applicant testified
that this debt was for medical treatment for his son. Applicant paid this debt and had it
removed  from  his  credit  report.  This  debt  does  not  appear  on  the  most  recent  credit
reports. (Tr. 49-51; GE 2; GE 3.)
SOR  ¶  1.o:  cell  phone  account  placed  for  collection  for  $2,019.  Applicant
testified  that  this  was  an  account  he  had  in  about  2009,  and  he  disputed  the  amount
owed. He does intend to pay this account but has not set up a payment plan. (Tr. 51-56.)
SOR  ¶  1.p:  cell  phone  account  placed  for  collection  for  $769.  Applicant
testified  that  he  closed  the  account,  because  he  was  dissatisfied  with  the  service.  He
planned to pay this off in December 2016 but was unable to do so due to lack of money.
Applicant plans to contact the creditor in October 2018. (Tr. 56-59.)
SOR ¶ 1.q: gym membership account placed for collection for $449. Applicant
testified that he became a member of the gym in 2013 or 2014 but was unable to use it,
because  his  disability  made  exercising  too  painful.  He  planned  to  pay  this  debt  and
contact the gym in December 2018. (Tr. 59-62.)
SOR  ¶  1.r:  cell  phone  account  placed  for  collection  for  $1,982.  Applicant
testified that this is an account he set up for his sister in about 2009 but is in his name.
He has not made any payments but intends to address that bill in 2019. (Tr. 62-63.)
SOR ¶ 1.s: See discussion of SOR ¶ 1.k, supra.
SOR ¶ 1.t: gym membership account placed for collection for $500. Applicant
testified  that  he  joined  this  gym  in  2014.  He  was  going  to  use  the  membership,  but  it
closed  and  left  no  phone  numbers  or  where  it  had  moved.  Applicant  called  a  national
number and was told they did not have his account. So, he stopped making payments.
He intends to pay the collection agency. (Tr. 65-67.)
Applicant testified that he incurred the SOR debts between October 2006 (when
he became disabled due to service-connected injuries) and August 2015 (when he found
full-time employment). (Tr. 21-23, 27-37, 40-56, 59-63, 65-67; AE A; GE 2-GE 4.)
To sum up, Applicant has resolved the following debts: SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.d, 1.j and
1.n = $10,306. The following debts have been deleted as being duplicative: SOR ¶¶ 1.h-
1.i  and  1.s  =  $15,921.  Corrected  for  duplicate  accounts,  the  SOR  alleged  $28,026  of
delinquent debts of which $10,306 have been resolved, leaving $17,720 of unresolved
SOR debt. Applicant has disputed SOR ¶ 1.k ($1,257) with the original creditor, because
he  claims  it  failed  to  give  him  credit  for  his  down  payment  ($1,000)  and  for  monthly
payments  totaling  $1,200.  If  that  dispute  is  credited  to  Applicant,  $16,463  remains  of
unresolved SOR debt.
Applicant testified about the current state of his finances. His gross monthly pay
before deductions is about $6,000. After payroll deductions, which includes child support
and  medical  insurance  for  his  two  minor  children,  Applicant’s  take-home  pay  is  about
$3,900 per month. After deductions for his mortgage, car, utilities, cable, his monthly IT
continuing education courses and adding in $350 per month of VA benefits, Applicant has
a monthly remainder of between $1,500 and $1,800. He uses that remainder to continue
to  pay  off  his delinquent  debts.  Applicant  tried  a  credit  counseling service  but  was  not
satisfied  with  it.  His  budget  is his checkbook.  Applicant  has  a  401(k)  plan  to  which  he
contributes 3% per paycheck but does not know its balance. In November 2017, he got
three credit cards, one with a $500 line, and two with $400 lines. Applicant is current with
those credit card payments, and they are not maxed out. (Tr. 68-76, 78-80, 84-85.)
Applicant  has  no  student  loan  payments,  because  they  are  deferred  while  he
pursues  his Master’s  degree.  He  purchased  his house  in  November 2017.  At  present,
Applicant is temporarily renting, because his house has mold infestation to which he is
allergic.  (Tr. 74, 81-82.)
