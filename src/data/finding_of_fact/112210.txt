Applicant is a 58-year-old trainer, employed by a defense contractor since 2012.
He graduated from high school in 1979. He was previously married in 1985 and divorced
in  2013.  He  has four adult  children, but  continues  to  pay  child  support for one  special
needs child. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1979 to 1982, and in the
Army Reserve since 1982. Applicant has held a security clearance for 40 years since first
entering  the  Army.  In  2007,  The  Department  of  the  Army  warned  Applicant  about
delinquent debts when his clearance was renewed.
The SOR alleges Applicant is delinquent on five debts totaling over $97,000, and
he failed to file and pay Federal income taxes for tax year 2016; owes the IRS for income
taxes due for tax years 2014 to 2016; and has two state tax liens from 2013 and 2015.
Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, but explained that his 2016 tax return was filed
when due, but the taxes were not paid.
Applicant attributes his poor financial status largely to his 2013 divorce. He noted
that his spouse handled household financial matters including taxes. They purchased a
home in 1998, and Applicant left the home in 2012 after his spouse left. They agreed to
list  the  home  for  three  to  six  months,  but  were  unable  to  sell  it.  Applicant  stopped
payments when he left for a job in another state. A foreclosure action was started in 2017,
and Applicant is past due about $85,000. He has done nothing to determine the status of
the debt or to attempt to resolve it. (SOR 1.a) Applicant noted that after the divorce, he
had difficulty transitioning to single living and paying bills on his own.
Applicant is past due on a loan that he claimed was taken out with his ex-spouse
for  about  $1,000.  His  credit  report  shows  the  loan  was  in  his  name  individually.  In
response to Government interrogatories, Applicant was unaware of the debt. In testimony,
he claimed that he has a payment agreement with the creditor and paid the loan off, but
he did not provide evidence of the agreement or evidence that the loan has been paid,
despite discussing it at the hearing. (SOR 1.b) This debt remains unresolved.
Applicant provided evidence that his 2016 Federal tax return was filed when due,
but  he  failed  to  pay  the  income  tax  owed.  (SOR  1.c)  Applicant  admitted  that  he  owed
Federal taxes for 2014 to 2016, that he did not have the money to pay his taxes on time,
and that he was slow about contacting the IRS to make payment arrangements. (SOR
1.d)  However,  the  documentation  he  provided  from  the  IRS  shows  he  was  behind  on
income tax payments for tax years 2012 to 2016, causing him to owe interest, penalties
or other charges, totaling $23,340. His pay was garnished and in 2016, he contacted the
IRS and made an arrangement to repay past-due income taxes. He borrowed money from
his 401k retirement program and made three sizable lump-sum payments in January and
February 2017, then paid monthly to June 2017. By July 2017, he reduced his tax liability
to $7,424, and apparently continued to pay. In March 2019, the IRS applied Applicant’s
2018 refund ($532) to the remainder of his 2016 tax liability, and paid off the balance.
Applicant’s  tax  preparer  assisted  him  in  adjusting  his  income  withholding  to  cover  his
future tax liabilities. This debt is resolved.
Applicant owes state taxes resulting in liens filed in 2013 and 2015, totaling $4,369.
He has not shown sufficient efforts to resolve these debts and they remain unpaid. (SOR
1.e and 1.f)
Applicant has not sought financial counseling and earns about $92,000 annually.
He has about $700 net savings per month after paying expenses, and has about $2,000
in  a  savings  account.  In  2018,  he  paid  a  state  income  tax  liability  from  2015  owed  to
another state, and intends to continue to pay other debts as appropriate according to his
financial ability.
Law and Policies
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484  U.S.  518, 528  (1988). As  Commander in  Chief,  the President  has  the  authority  to
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his  designee to grant applicants
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is  clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An
administrative  judge  must  consider  a  person’s  stability,  trustworthiness,  reliability,
discretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG 1(b).
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the
possible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant
has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the  President  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  have
established for issuing a clearance.
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the
personal or professional history  of  the applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant from
being  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information.  The  Government  has  the  burden  of
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. “Substantial
evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. Washington
Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a
nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the  criteria  listed
therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3
(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015).
Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the
facts. Directive E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG 1(d).
