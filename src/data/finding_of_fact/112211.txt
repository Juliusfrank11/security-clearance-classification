Applicant  is  a  28-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance  for  the  first  time.  He  is  employed  as  a  manufacturing  technician  for  a  large
company  in  the  defense  industry.  He  has  been  so  employed  since  March  2016.  He
earns a wage of about $17 per hour.  His educational background includes attending a
technical institute from September 2010 to December 2012, when he was awarded an
associate’s  degree  in  electronics  engineering.  He  married  in  2016,  and  he  and  his
spouse  had  a  church  wedding  in  July  2018.  He  has  a  ten-year-old  stepdaughter.  His
spouse  does  not  receive  child  support  for  her  daughter.  His  spouse  has  a  minimum-
wage job as a school-bus monitor for children with special needs.
Before  his  current  job,  Applicant  had  a  full-time  job  as  an  assembler  from
September 2014 to March 2016. Before that, he worked as a contractor from June 2014
to  September  2014.  Before  that,  he  worked  as  an  installer  from  March  2013  to  June
2014. And before that, he was unemployed and a full-time student as noted above.
The SOR  concerns  a history  of financial problems  consisting  of failure  to  timely
file  state  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2014  and  2016;  failure  to  timely  file  federal
income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2016; $668 in back taxes
owed to the IRS for tax year 2015; and a delinquent student loan account charged-off in
the  amount  of  $8,426.  Department  Counsel agreed  that  Applicant  was  not  required  to
file  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2011  and  2012,  because  Applicant  was  then  a  full-time
student  and did  not  have  earned  income  subject  to taxation.  (Tr. 43-44) This fact  was
also  established  by  tax  records  for  those  years.  (Exhibits  A-D)  Accordingly,  tax  years
2011 and 2012 are not discussed further herein. In both his answer to the SOR and in
his  hearing  testimony,  he  attributed  his  tax  problems  to  immaturity,  ignorance,  and
apathy.  (Tr.  32,  49)  He  attributed  his  charged-off  student  loan  to  an  inability  to  obtain
employment in the technology field after earning his degree in December 2012. He then
worked  a  series  of minimum-wage  jobs  that  did  not  provide  sufficient  income  to  repay
the loan.
Applicant is now in compliance with both federal and state tax authorities. Those
matters are discussed below, beginning with the federal tax matters.
Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  a  federal  income  tax  return  for  tax  year  2013.
(Exhibit  E)  He  eventually  filed  a  return  on  March  9,  2015;  he  was  issued  a  refund  of
$981; and he had an IRS account balance of $0 as of April 2015.
Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  a  federal  income  tax  return  for  tax  year  2014.
(Exhibits F and M) He eventually filed a return on December 5, 2017. He was accessed
penalties for not pre-paying tax, for the past-due return, and for late payment of tax. An
overpayment  from  tax  year  2017  was  applied  to  tax  year  2014  in  May  2018.  He
received a $703 refund for tax year 2014. He had  an IRS account balance of $0 as of
May 2018.
Applicant  timely  filed  a  federal  income  tax  return  for  tax  year  2015  on  April  15,
2016. (Exhibits H and N) He was accessed penalties for late payment of tax. He had a
past-due balance of $668 as of November 2017. He made two payments, in June and
September  2017,  for  a  total  of  $1,181.  The  IRS  applied  a  $520  refund  due  to  an
overpayment for tax year 2015 in September 2017. He had an IRS account balance of
$0 as of December 2017.
Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  a  federal  income  tax  return  for  tax  year  2016.
(Exhibits I and O) He requested and received an extension to file on October 15, 2017.
He eventually filed a return on December 5, 2017. He had a past-due balance of $1,191
as of October 2017. He had an IRS account balance of $0 as of May 2018.
Applicant timely filed a federal income tax return for tax year 2017, which was the
most recent tax year as of the September 2018 hearing. (Exhibit P) He filed the return
on April 15, 2018. He had an IRS account balance of $0 as of May 2018.
Applicant wrote in his answer to the SOR that he eventually filed a state  income
tax  return  for  tax  year  2014  around  November  22,  2017,  which  was  untimely,  and  he
learned  that  he  owed  $586  in  back  taxes.  He  contacted  the  state  tax  authority  in
January  2018  and  arranged  a  monthly  payment  of  $28  beginning  in  May  2018.  He
further wrote that he filed a state return for tax year 2016 around November 2017, which
was also untimely, and he owed no further tax. He contacted the state tax authority in
September 2018, and received confirmation by e-mail that the past-due balance for tax
year 2014 was paid, and there was no balance due on his account. (Exhibit G) After the
hearing,  he  provided  a  certificate  of  compliance/letter  of  good  standing  from  the  state
tax authority, dated September 26, 2018, which shows he has filed returns and paid all
taxes due. (Exhibit Q)
Applicant  has  just  started  repaying  the  charged-off  student  loan  for  $8,426.
(Exhibit J) About a month before the hearing in August 2018, he entered into a payment
arrangement  with  the  lender  to  pay  $20  monthly  on  the  18th  of  every  month.  He  had
made one payment per the agreement at the time of the hearing. He also made a $25
payment shortly after he received the SOR. (Tr. 41-42) Altogether, he estimated making
less  than  $500  in  total  payments  on  his  total  student  loan  obligations  since  he  was
awarded  his  degree  in  December  2012.  (Tr.  41)  A  September  2018  credit  report
presented by Applicant shows he has several more student loan accounts  (nine by my
count) that are 120-days or more past due. (Exhibit L)
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
1  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S.  518,  528  (1988)  (“it  should  be  obvious  that  no  one  has  a
‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no
right to a security clearance).

presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.6
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;
AG ¶ 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local
income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income
tax as required;
AG  ¶  20(c)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  a  death,  divorce,  or
separation,  clear  victimization  by  predatory  lending  practices,  or  identity
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and
6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶¶ E3.1.14 and E3.1.15.
AG ¶ 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax
authority  to  file  or  pay  the  amount  owed  and  is  in  compliance  with  those
arrangements.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.  The
disqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.
Turning  to  the  matters  in  mitigation,  it  appears  the  genesis  of  Applicant’s
indebtedness  was  a  series  of  minimum-wage  jobs  after  completing  his  technical
education in December 2012. That went on until he began his current job in 2016.  The
result  was  he  lacked  the  means  to  service  his  student  loan.  Nevertheless,  his  under
employment did not prevent him from timely filing state and federal income tax returns.
Given  these  circumstances,  the  mitigating  condition  at  AG  ¶  20(c)  applies,  but  only  in
part, and Applicant receives some credit in mitigation.
Concerning the charged-off student loan for more than $8,000, Applicant has not
yet  made  “a  good-faith  effort”  to  resolve  the  debt.  He  defaulted  on  the  account  years
ago and only made a payment arrangement with the lender shortly before the hearing.
Doing  so  is the  first  step  in  the  right  direction,  but  it  is too  soon  to  tell  if  Applicant  will
adhere  to  the  repayment  arrangement.  Given  these  circumstances,  the  mitigating
condition at AG ¶ 20(d) does not apply.
Applicant  made  good  progress  in  resolving  the  tax  matters,  and  he  is  now  in
compliance with both federal and state tax authorities. That means he has filed all tax
returns, as required, and he has paid all taxes due, as required. And he did a good job
documenting his compliance.
In addressing this issue, I note that an applicant’s failure to timely file tax returns
and pay tax when due bears close examination and is a matter of serious concern to the
federal  government.  Here,  I  am  concerned  about  the  duration  of  Applicant’s  tax
problems  (multiple  tax  years)  and  the  timing  of  his  remedial  action.  Applicant  failed  to
timely file state income tax returns for two tax years, and he failed to timely file federal
income tax returns for three tax years. He has been in compliance since the December
2017-May 2018 timeframe, and he filed his federal return for tax year 2017 on a timely
basis in April 2018. Still, it is too soon to tell if he will continue to meet his tax obligations
on  a  timely  basis.  Given  these  circumstances,  the  mitigating  condition  at  AG  ¶  20(g)
applies,  but  the  evidence  is  not  sufficient  to  justify  complete  mitigation  of  his  long-
standing irresponsibility in failing to meet his lawful tax obligations.
Following Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to  protect
classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence
as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he
has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with
the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a -- 1.d:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for
access to classified information. Eligibility denied.
