4 Applicant “denied” SOR ¶ 1.e, but only because the relative has since been promoted from the military
rank referenced in the allegation. (Answer; Tr. 12)
Applicant  is  34  years  old.  He  was  born  in  Afghanistan  in  1984.  He  graduated
from  high  school  in  Afghanistan  in  2004.  He  worked  for  defense  contractors  with  U.S.
military  forces  in  Afghanistan  from  2005  until  he  came  to  the  United  States  under  the
special immigrant visa program in 2009, and became a permanent resident of the U.S.
soon thereafter. He became a U.S. citizen in October 2016, and holds a U.S. passport.
His Afghan passport expired in 2015. He is no longer a citizen of Afghanistan. (Tr. 32-
33, 62-64; GE 1)
Since he came to the U.S., Applicant has largely worked in the defense industry,
both  before  and  after  he  became  a  U.S.  citizen.  He  began  working  for  his  current
employer  in  2009.  He  deployed  to  Afghanistan  from  April  2010  to  August  2012  and
worked  with  U.S.  forces.  After  taking  time  off,  he  redeployed  to  Afghanistan  from
February  2013  to  November  2014.  He  was  then  laid off  because  his  company  had no
work for permanent U.S. residents. He was unemployed in the U.S. for several months
before finding work outside the defense industry. (Tr. 34-39, 62-64; GE 1)
Applicant resumed working for his current employer in 2016, when he submitted
his SCA. He redeployed to Afghanistan as a linguist and translator in January 2017. He
remained there until December 2018. He has never held a clearance before. (Tr. 6, 15,
60-65; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleges  foreign  influence  security  concerns  due  to  Applicant’s  family
members  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Afghanistan,  specifically  his  parents,  a
sister,  five  brothers,  and  a  brother-in-law.  Applicant’s  family  lives  in  a  major  city  in
Afghanistan. Their details are as follows:
Applicant’s mother: (SOR ¶ 1.b) She passed away in early December 2018, three
days after Applicant returned to the U.S. on leave. He did not return to Afghanistan for
her  funeral.  (Tr.  31,  65,  Answer;  GE  1)  Understandably,  Applicant  has  spoken  to  his
father and his siblings frequently since then, including two days before the hearing. (Tr.
41, 66) SOR ¶ 1.b is found for Applicant, since his mother is deceased. (Tr. 95)
Applicant’s  father:  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  He  is  in  his  mid-70s.  He  retired  about  25  years
ago as a colonel in the Afghan army. He collects a monthly pension. Applicant usually
contacts  his father monthly.  His  father  has never  visited  the  United  States.  (Tr. 40-43,
48, 70; Answer; GE 1)
Applicant’s sister and brother-in-law (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.e) Applicant’s sister, age 39,
is a housewife. She is married to Applicant’s brother-in-law, who is also his cousin. He
is about 45 years old, and is an officer in the Afghan army, assigned to a training facility.
He was recently promoted from major (as alleged) to lieutenant colonel. Applicant has
little direct contact with him, though he speaks to his sister every three or four months.
Through  his  oldest  brother,  he  sends  her  money  (less  than  $100)  every  few  months.
They have never visited the United States. (Tr. 43-44, 48, 54, 69-70)
Applicant’s oldest brother: Applicant is in closest contact with his oldest brother,
at least once a month, sometimes more. Applicant sends him money to be distributed to
his other siblings. This brother is married and has several children. He formerly owned a
hotel  and  a  restaurant  but  now  drives  a  taxi.  He  has  no  military  or  government
affiliations. (Tr. 48-51, 67; Answer; GE 1)
Applicant’s  second  older  brother:  He  owns  a  small  shop  near  his  other  family
members.  He  has  no  military  or  government  affiliations.  He  is  married  with  several
children. Applicant contacts him every four to six months to check on his well-being, and
occasionally sends money for his children ($100). (Tr. 50-51; Answer; GE 1)
Applicant’s third older brother: He worked with U.S. forces as a local interpreter
from  2009  to  2011,  when  he  was  wounded  on  a  mission.  He  lives  at  home  with  his
father. He is seeking to come to the U.S. on a special immigrant visa. Applicant contacts
him about every two months. (Tr. 51-52; Answer; GE 1)
Applicant’s  two  younger  brothers.  One  brother  recently  graduated  from  college
and  started  a  job  for  an  American  company,  working  in  Afghanistan.  Applicant’s
youngest  brother  is  still  in  college.  Neither  is  married,  and  they  have  no  children.
Applicant speaks to them about every two months. (Tr. 52-53; Answer; GE 1)
During  his  prior  deployments,  Applicant  earned  as  much  as  $185,000  annually.
He estimated that he sent his family between about $50,000 and $65,000 between 2010
and 2014. He paid to renovate his parents’ house in Afghanistan, and he sent money to
one of his brothers as an engagement and wedding present, which the brother used to
buy a car. Since then, he has not sent them nearly as much money. In 2017, he sent his
family  about $600. In 2018,  he and  his  girlfriend  sent  his father  about $2,000. (Tr.  42,
53-54, 73)
Applicant  testified  that  his  family  members  know  that  he  is  deployed  to
Afghanistan, but they do not know what he does. He is not allowed to visit them while
on duty because he is not authorized to leave the base. Applicant has visited his family
when he is on leave. He is not allowed to visit his family while on his current contract, so
he will not see them after his return to Afghanistan after the hearing. (Tr. 44-47, 66-69)
Applicant owns no property in Afghanistan and he has no assets there. He may
inherit a share of his father’s house one day, like his other siblings. He is registered to
vote in the U.S. He has money in the U.S. stock market through an investment account,
which  he  valued  at  about  $100,000.  His  pay  is  deposited  into  a  U.S.  bank  account.
Applicant’s U.S. home of record is his girlfriend’s parents’ house. (Tr. 57-60, 71, 72)
Applicant’s girlfriend, age 37, is a naturalized U.S. citizen from Afghanistan. She
came to the U.S. with her parents and siblings as a child, in 1990. She became a U. S.
citizen in 2008, and holds a U.S. passport. Her parents and two of her four brothers are
also  naturalized  U.S.  citizens.  Since  leaving  as  a  child,  she  has  never  been  back  to
Afghanistan,  though  she  has  extended  family  there.  She  has  spoken  to  several  of
Applicant’s Afghan family members by phone. She has a bachelor’s degree. She helps
her mother, who owns a hair salon. (Tr. 80-88)
Applicant  and  his  girlfriend  met  online  and  have  been  together  since  August
2013. She testified that he is dedicated, patient, fair, and loving. He is trustworthy and
reliable.  (Tr.  80-84)  She  said  he  took  the  job  in  Afghanistan  to  help  them build for  the
future. (Tr. 88-89)
Applicant supplied strong character references from several U.S. military officers
who served with him in Afghanistan, often on a daily basis, both several years ago, and
recently.  All  attested  to  his  professional  skill  and  high  value  as  an  interpreter,  cultural
advisor, and trusted team member. They universally attest to his loyalty, reliability, and
trustworthiness.  (AE  B  -  AE  F.  AE  I)  Applicant  also  submitted  several  certificates  of
appreciation and training certificates, detailing his hard work, dedication, and exemplary
performance. (AE A, AE G, AE H)
Administrative Notice-Afghanistan5
The U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens not to travel to Afghanistan due
to  crime,  terrorism,  civil  unrest, and  armed  conflict.  Extremists  associated  with  various
Taliban  networks,  the  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Levant,  and  members  of  other  armed
opposition  groups  are  active  throughout  the  country.  Afghanistan  continues  to
experience  aggressive  and  coordinated  attacks  by  the  Taliban  and  other  terrorist
groups. The border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan remains a safe haven for
terrorists.  The  country’s  most  significant  human-rights  concerns  are  widespread
violence,  armed  insurgent  groups’  attacks  on  civilians,  and  killing  of  persons  affiliated
with the government.
