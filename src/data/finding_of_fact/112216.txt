Applicant  is  a  65-year-old  software  developer.  He  has  worked  for  his  current
security  clearance  sponsor  since  about  April  2018.  He  worked  for  a  different  federal

Applicant was born in Pakistan and entered the United States in September 1972
at the age of 18. He married a U.S. citizen in 1974 and divorced in 1977. He remarried

the  United  States.  They  have  become  U.S.  citizens,  as  well.  Applicant  has  one  other
brother and  six  sisters, who  are  citizens  and  residents  of Pakistan.  Applicant’s  mother
returned to Pakistan due to her health and lives with Applicant’s brother and one of his
sisters. Applicant’s sisters take care of her in her old age. (Tr. 18-19; SCA 19-20, 23-24,
26-27, 32, and 42-43.)
Applicant’s mother-in-law has been a housewife her entire life. She is almost 80
years old. He does not speak with her due to a disagreement. He last spoke with her in
2015  or  2016.  Since  then,  Applicant’s  wife  has  also  not  spoken  with  her  mother.
Applicant’s father-in-law was a civil engineer. Applicant’s wife has travelled to Pakistan
on two occasions since he married her in 1989 and brought her to the United States. (Tr.
30-32 and 43-4; SCA 31.)
Since arriving in the United States in 1972, Applicant travelled to Pakistan twice,
once in 1982, after becoming a U.S. citizen and again in 2015 for less than 10 days to
visit with most of his family. He made the trip with one of his American brothers and was
unemployed at the time. Applicant’s wife did not accompany him. He did not visit with any
non-family members during that trip. He did not return to Pakistan for the funeral of his
father in 1989. He does not plan to attend the funeral of his mother or any other relative
in the future for practical reasons. He has no plans to return to Pakistan for any reason in
the future. He speaks or otherwise communicates with his mother every few months. He
last saw her in Pakistan during his 2015 trip. His mother does not know that he is seeking
a security clearance from the U.S. Government. (Tr. 14-15, 19-20, 31-32, 36, 39, and 45.)

passport, and he does not consider himself to be a Pakistani citizen. He also submitted a
substantial  amount  of  character  evidence  attesting  to  his  loyalty  and  dedication  to  the
interests of the United States. (Tr. 46; SCA 9; AE A, E, H, I, and J.)
Pakistan
The  U.S.  State  Department  warns  U.S.  citizens  to  reconsider  travel  to  Pakistan
due  to  terrorism.  Travel  by  U.S.  Government  personnel  within  Pakistan  is  restricted.
Terrorist  groups  continue  to  pose  a  danger  to  U.S.  citizens  throughout  Pakistan,  and
evidence suggests that some victims of terrorist activity were targeted because they are
Americans.  Although  al-Qaida  in  Pakistan  has  been  degraded,  its  global  leadership
continued to operate from remote locations in the region that the group has historically
exploited for safe haven. Pakistan has not taken substantial action against the Afghan
Taliban or Haqqani Network, or substantially limit their ability to threaten U.S. interests in
Afghanistan. Pakistan has also not taken sufficient action against other externally focused
terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad, which continued to
operate, train, organize, and fundraise in Pakistan.
The  U.S.  State  Department’s  2017  Human Rights  Report for Pakistan  indicates
that  the  most  serious  human  rights  problems  in  Pakistan  were  the  following:  (1)
extrajudicial and targeted killings; (2) disappearances; (3) torture; (4) lack of rule of law;
(5)  poor  implementation  and  enforcement  of  laws;  and  (6)  frequent  mob  violence  and
vigilante  justice  with  limited  accountability.  Other  human  rights  problems  included
arbitrary  detention,  lengthy  pretrial  detention,  governmental  infringement  on  citizens’
privacy rights, a weak criminal justice system, and a lack of judicial independence in the
lower  courts,  and  harassment  of  journalists.  There  were  government  restrictions  on
freedom  of  assembly  and  limits  on  freedom  of  movement.  Government  practices  and
certain  laws  limited  freedom  of  religion,  particularly  for  religious  minorities.  Corruption
within  the  government  and  police,  as  well  as  discrimination  against  women  and  girls
remained  serious  problems.  The  authorities  seldom  punished  government  officials  for
human rights violations.
