Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2010
through 2018. He paid his 2010 and 2011 income taxes after the IRS filed collection and
levy  notices  against  him.  He  has  yet  to  file  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2012
through  2018.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b)  His  SOR  admissions,  and  those  at  the  hearing,  are
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I
make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  59-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  graduated  from
high  school  in  1979.  He  enlisted  in  the  U.S.  Navy  in  1981  and  honorably  served  until
2002,  when  he  retired  as  an  E-6,  and  was  then  transferred  to  the  Reserve.  He
possessed a secret clearance during most of his service. Applicant married in 1991 and
divorced in 2004. He has one son, age 24.
Applicant submitted an SCA in March 2016, requesting eligibility for a clearance,
recently required for him to continue his job with the U.S. Merchant Marine (USMM). He
started  working  for  federal  contractors  with  the  USMM  in  2006.  He  was  employed
between 2006 and 2014; unemployed between April 2014 and September 2015 (due to
medical  issues);  and  employed  from  September  2015  to  present  with  different
companies and federal contractors.
In  his  response  to  Section  26  (Financial  Record)  of  his  2016  SCA,  Applicant
disclosed that he did not timely file his federal income tax return for tax year 2010. He
explained he failed to file his 2010 income tax return because he was deployed, but he
requested an extension to file his tax return.
The record evidence shows that Applicant failed to timely file his federal income
tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2018. Specifically,  he filed his 2010 income tax
return  in  August  2012;  established  an  installment  agreement  in  September  2012;  and
paid  off  his  2010  tax  debt  in  May  2019.  He  filed  his  2011  income  tax  return  and
established  an  installment  agreement  in  May  2012;  and  paid  off  his  2011  tax  debt  in
September 2015. (AE 1, IRS account transcripts for 2010-2011) Applicant claimed that
he did not timely file his 2010 and 2011 income tax returns because his accountant had
mental  health  problems  and  failed  to  file  the  taxes.  The  IRS  sent  him  collection  and
intent  to  levy  notices  before  Applicant  established  payment  agreements  to  pay  taxes
owed for 2010 and 2011.
As  of  his  hearing,  Applicant  had  not  filed  his  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax
years  2012  through  2018.  The  total  taxes  he  owes  for  those  years  is  unknown.
Applicant testified that he retained the services of another accountant to help him file his
late  tax  returns  after  he  received  the  SOR.  He  claimed  he  was  in  the  process  of
providing  the  accountant  with  information  so  that  he  can  complete  and  file  his
delinquent tax returns.
Applicant  expressed  remorse  for  not  filing  his  income  tax  returns  on  time.  He
claimed  that  he  has  learned  a  hard  lesson  and  promised  to  timely  file  his  income  tax
returns  and  to  pay  his  taxes  in  the  future.  He  averred  that  he  failed  to  file  his  2012  –
2018 tax returns because of his multiple deployments and his prior accountant’s mental
health problems.
Applicant  highlighted  his  over  35  years  of  combined  service  in  the  Navy  and
working for the USMM. He is concerned about not getting his clearance and losing his
job.  In  the  past,  his  job  did  not  require  him  to  have  a  clearance,  but  recently  they
changed  the  rules.  Applicant’s  boat  captain  (master)  submitted  a  highly  favorable
endorsement.  In  his  opinion,  Applicant  has  served  with  distinction  as  the  ship’s
storekeeper  during  the  last  three  years.  He  considers  Applicant  to  be  honest  and
trustworthy; the single best storekeeper in the fleet; highly respected by his peers; a true
seaman; a model citizen; and a patriot in the truest sense of the word. (AE 2)
Applicant’s  crewmember  evaluation  reports  for  years  2018  and  2019  show  that
he  has  been  rated  excellent  (the  highest  rating)  in  most  categories,  or  above  average
(the second highest rating) in the remaining categories. (AE 3)
