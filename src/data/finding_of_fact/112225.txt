In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  admitted  all  the  allegations.  Her
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 36-year-old licensed practical nurse (LPN) employed by a federal
contractor since July 2016. She was licensed after completing school in June 2009. She
was employed in the private sector from December 2009 to October 2014. She worked
part  time  from  December  2009  to  March  2010,  was  unemployed  from  March  to  June
2010, worked full time from June 2010 to February 2013, left by mutual agreement, and
was  unemployed  from  to  February  2013  to  August  2013.  She  was  employed  by  a
medical  doctor  from  August  2013  to  October  2014  and  left  by  mutual  agreement.  She
was  unemployed  for  two  months  and  then  worked  for  a  federal  contractor  from
November 2014 to March 2016, when she was fired for tardiness and absenteeism. She
was  unemployed  until  she  was  hired  for  her  current  position.  (FORM  Item  2  at  11-17;
FORM Item 3 at 2, 12.) She has never married and has no children. She has never held
a security clearance or eligibility for a public trust position.
The  SOR  alleges  18  delinquent  debts,  totaling  about  $37,366.  The  debts  are
reflected in credit reports from June 2016 and September 2017 and the summary of a
personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  conducted  in  March  2017.  (FORM  Items  3,  4  and  5.)
The  debts  are  a  $10,209  indebtedness  to  the  U.S.  government  related  to  disability
payments,  a  delinquent  car  loan,  three  delinquent  student  loans,  three  delinquent
medical bills, and ten miscellaneous consumer debts. In the March 2017 PSI, Applicant
admitted  the  delinquent  student  loans  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.i  and  promised  to
bring them up to date by January 2018. (FORM Item 5 at 9-10.)
1 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from her application for a public trust position (GX 1) unless
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  admitted  all  the  debts  and  stated  that
payment  plans  were  in  place  for  two  student  loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.i).  She  also
stated  that  a  telecommunications  bill  had  been  paid  (SOR  ¶  1.p),  and  that  she  had
payment plans in place or was trying to negotiate settlements for the rest of the debts
alleged in the SOR. She attached a document to her answer, reflecting that the student
loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.i are “in repayment,” and that the accounts were not
delinquent as of January 25, 2018. (Attachment to Answer.)
Both student loans were delinquent when Applicant was interviewed by a security
investigator in March 2017. (FORM Item 3 at 10-11.) The credit report from September
2017 reflected that both loans were still delinquent and that the date of last activity on
both  loans  was  in  November  2013,  when  they  were  assigned  to  the  government.
(FORM  Item  5  at  2.)  The  Attachment  to  Answer  reflects  a  disbursement  date  of
September 19, 2017 for both loans. It does not reflect when the loans became current,
nor  does  it  indicate  whether  they  became  current  through  voluntary  payments  or
involuntary  action  such  as  garnishment  or  diversion  of  tax  refunds.  Although  the  loan
servicer  reflected  in  the  Attachment  to  Answer  was  different  from  the  loan  servicer
alleged in the SOR, the amounts were almost identical. Accordingly, I find that the debts
in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.i were not delinquent as of January 25, 2018.
Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR  did  dispute  any  of  the  debts.  The  credit  report
from  September  2017  (FORM  Item  5)  did  not  reflect  any  disputed  accounts.  In  her
response to the FORM, she submitted documentary evidence that two student loans not
alleged  in  the  SOR  were  current.  She  also  submitted  a  credit  report  from  June  2018,
reflecting  that  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.b,  1.d-1.h,  and  1.j-1.n  were  currently
under  dispute,  but  the  credit  report  does  not  reflect  the  basis  for  the  disputes  or  the
dates when they were disputed. (AX A.)
I adhere to and incorporate by reference the statement of policies in my original
decision.
