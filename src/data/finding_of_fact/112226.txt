Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $102,076 for five
delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a – 1.e), two of which (SOR 1.c and 1.d) were for
unpaid federal income tax liens totaling $71,886.78. The SOR also alleged that in June
2002,  Applicant  filed  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  petition  through  which  his  debts  were
discharged in November 2002 (SOR 1.f).
In response to the SOR, Applicant denied SOR 1.a, asserting that he had been
repaying  the  debt  through  an  agreement  with  the  creditor established  before  the  SOR
was issued. He denied SOR 1.b, asserting that he had repaid the debt before he received
the SOR (the last payment was made on October 31, 2017; Applicant signed for the SOR
on November 28, 2017). Applicant admitted SOR 1.c and 1.d, but he asserted that he
had  entered  into  an  agreement  with  the  IRS  to  place  both  liens  temporarily  into
“uncollectible status” so he could resolve his other debts, and that he planned to begin
repaying his tax debts in early 2018. Applicant denied SOR 1.e, claiming the debt and the
lien enforcing it had already been paid. Finally, Applicant admitted SOR 1.f, but asserted
that  the  bankruptcy  action  was  taken  15  years  ago  and  has  no  relevance  to  an
assessment of his current suitability for access to classified information. (Answer; Tr. 12
– 14)
In support of his response, Applicant provided documents that show, as of the date
of his Answer, he has been paying the SOR 1.a debt on a monthly or near-monthly basis
since March 2015; that the SOR 1.b debt was resolved in  October 2017; that the SOR
1.e debt and a lien enforcing that debt also had been resolved in August and November
2017,  respectively.  Applicant’s  Answer  also  included  documentation  of  his  agreement
with the IRS in January 2016 to hold his tax debts (SOR 1.c and 1.d) in abeyance.
In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by  Applicant’s  admissions  and  by  the
information presented with his Answer, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 42 years old and has worked as a certified information technology (IT)
specialist  since  at  least  June  2001.  He  started  working  for  defense  contractors  in
November  2010  and  first  received  a  security  clearance  in  March  2011.  Between
November 2010 and February 2015, he worked on a series of military support contracts
and  was  located  in  Afghanistan.  Thereafter,  he  worked  until  August  2015  on  a  similar
contract  in  South  Korea.  From  December  2015  until  July  2018,  he  was  assigned  to  a
military  support  contract  in  State  A.  Since  then,  he  has  worked  on  a  different  military
support  contract  in  State  B.  Applicant  produced  ten  letters  of  recommendation  and
support that portray him as professional, hardworking, trustworthy, and reliable. He also
received  numerous  awards  and  other  forms  of  recognition  and  appreciation  from  his
military customers for his work in or near combat zones in Afghanistan. (GX 1; GX 7; Tr.
65 – 68)
Applicant was married from July 2003 until divorcing in April 2006. He remarried in
July 2011, but divorced in August 2012. Applicant has one child (now 11 years old) with
a third woman with whom he lived between 2006 and 2009. Since April 2014, that woman
and their child lived, with Applicant when he was between contracts, in a house Applicant
has owned in State C since April 2014. The debt alleged at SOR 1.e is for a lien against
that property that arose from the woman’s failure to pay homeowners association (HOA)
dues; however, she paid that debt in August 2017 and the lien was removed in November
2017. (Answer; GX 2; GX AX 5; Tr. 62 – 63, 103)
Between  November  2010  and  February  2014,  Applicant  worked  on  a  series  of
contracts for two defense contractors at a forward operating base (FOB) in Afghanistan.
When he was hired by the second contractor in late 2011, he was asked to complete an
IRS form to be used in calculating his tax obligations for income earned overseas. He
was unsure how to complete the form and asked fellow employees and his manager for
guidance. He submitted the form based on the information they provided; however, their
advice was incorrect. As a result, Applicant’s employer did not withhold enough income
tax from his paycheck for the 2012 and 2013 tax years. On July 31, 2014, the IRS filed a
tax lien against Applicant to protect and enforce a $28,441.31 debt for unpaid taxes in the
2012 tax year. On August 31, 2015, the IRS filed a tax lien against Applicant to protect
and enforce a $43,445.47 debt for unpaid taxes in the 2013 tax year. (Answer; GX 2; GX
7; GX 9; AX 3; AX 4; Tr. 53 – 55, 126)
After he completed his work in Afghanistan in February 2014, Applicant was hired
by another defense contractor for work in Korea. He lived and worked there between April
2014 and August 2015. While he was in Korea, he learned of the tax liens against him
and contacted the IRS to resolve his debts through repayment plans. Around July 2014,
he also received unsolicited calls and emails from companies specializing in tax relief and
claiming to help him resolve his obligations for far less than the debt he actually owed.
Applicant hired one of those companies (GTS) for $10,000 but soon realized their plan
would not resolve his tax debt. In 2015, he hired another company (TDN) who contacted
the IRS on his behalf. At that time, Applicant was out of work, having been laid off by his
employer at the end of their contract in Korea. The IRS agreed to place Applicant’s 2012
and 2013 tax debts in an uncollectable status because of his financial situation. Under
that agreement, the liens would remain in place to protect the IRS’s interests; Applicant
would  claim  zero  exemptions  from  income  tax  withholding;  interest  would  continue  to
accrue;  and  Applicant  would  not  have  to  make  payments  until  such  time  as  the  IRS
determined he was again able to pay his debts. (Answer; GX 7; AX 3; AX 4; Tr. 56 – 59,
86 – 88, 128)
After  his  contract  in  Korea  ended,  Applicant  was  unemployed  between  August
2015 and December 2015. His company then rehired him for work at a military installation
in State A. When Applicant was sent to Korea, his employer paid him a monthly stipend
for housing. That money was provided separate from Applicant’s paycheck and was not
reduced  by  income  tax  withholdings,  and  it  covered  Applicant’s  housing  expenses  in
Korea. Applicant was supposed to receive money for relocation and a four-month housing
stipend, under the same payment arrangements as in Korea, to pay for his housing while
working in State A; however, when the housing stipend began in January 2016, it was
reduced  through  income  tax  withholdings.  The  result  was  that  Applicant  did  not  have
enough money to pay for both his State A and State C residences. Not only was he still
unable to start repaying his IRS debts, he accrued additional debts, two of which (SOR
1.a and 1.b) were alleged in the SOR. Although Applicant’s employer eventually made
good on the shortfall in his stipend, Applicant had already fallen behind on some of his
debts. And after the four-month stipend period ended, he had to support two residences.
Since July 2018, Applicant’s current employer in State B has paid all of his State B living
and  transportation  expenses,  thus  alleviating  Applicant’s  dual  residence  expenses.
(Answer; GX 2; GX 9; AX 9; Tr. 73 – 82, 119 – 122)
Applicant started repaying, and is still repaying, the SOR 1.a debt in March 2015.
To date, he consistently has made at least 48 monthly payments averaging $300 as part
of a resolution agreed to by the creditor. The total paid up to April 2019 is about half the
amount  alleged  in  SOR  1.a.  In  October  2017,  Applicant  completed  a  repayment
agreement to resolve the SOR 1.b debt. (Answer; AX 1; AX 2; Tr. 83 – 86)
In the first half of 2018, Applicant and TDN began working  with the IRS to start
repaying his tax debts. Applicant testified that the whole process took several months as
he responded to IRS requests for information. In January 2018, Applicant’s income had
increased to a point where he could cover all of his regular expenses, as well as his other
debts, and commit to a meaningful repayment plan with the IRS. Before that agreement
was  finalized,  Applicant  of  his  own  accord  made  payments  in  August  and  September
totaling $2,315. On November 15, 2018, TDN notified Applicant the IRS had approved a
repayment plan beginning in December 2018, whereby Applicant is to pay $1,431 each
month  on  a  total  tax  debt  of  $98,756.  That  figure  includes  Applicant’s  tax  liabilities  for
2012  through  2017.  The  additional  tax  years  were  included,  ostensibly,  because
retroactive correction of his 2012 and 2013 returns affected subsequent filings and tax
liabilities.  As  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  had  timely  made  the  required  payments  via
automatic bank account deductions starting in December 2018. It does not appear that
Applicant has ever failed to file his income tax returns as required. (Answer; AX 3; AX 4;
Tr. 15, 59 – 60, 86 – 92)
Applicant has experienced financial problems in the past. In 2002, he filed for and
received  Chapter  7  liquidation  of  his  then-existing  debts.  The  record  does  not  contain
information about the amount of debt that was liquidated or the circumstances that led to
his decision to file bankruptcy. When he submitted an e-QIP in 2010, Applicant disclosed
15  delinquent  or  past-due  debts  totaling  $7,435.  During  a  November  2010  subject
interview during the ensuing background investigation, Applicant explained that his debts
arose from a combination of his 2006 divorce and a period of unemployment. Many of the
debts he disclosed had already been paid when he submitted his e-QIP. During the 2011
adjudication of his clearance, he provided O adjudicators with documentation of his efforts
to resolve his debts and his clearance was granted. (Answer; AX 6; AX 8; Tr. 94 - 101)
Applicant has not incurred any new delinquencies in addition to those alleged in
the  SOR.  He  meets  all  of  his  current  obligations  and,  after  meeting  all  of  his  monthly
expenses  including  tax  lien  payments  and  payment  of  the  SOR  1.a  debt,  he  has  a
significant  positive  cash  flow.  Applicant  also  has  had  to  pay  for  unexpected  events,
including  family  emergencies,  and  he  has  repaid  earlier  personal  loans  from  family
members  who  helped  him  when  he  was  struggling.  Currently,  Applicant  and  TDN  are
negotiating with the IRS to subordinate the tax liens against him so he can refinance the
mortgage  on  his  house.  He  hopes  to  use  an  estimated  $40,000  in  available  equity  to
accelerate repayment of his tax debts. (Answer; Tr. 101 – 116, 130 – 131)
Applicant  has  an  excellent  reputation  among  his  professional  and  personal
associates.  Numerous  letters  of  recommendation  voice  support  based  on  the  authors’
integrity,  and
positive  observations  of  Applicant’s  work  ethic,  professionalism,
trustworthiness. Each of his references expressed, without reservation, their confidence
in  Applicant’s  ability  and  willingness  to  protect  sensitive  information  and  in  his
commitment  to  the  government  and  military  missions  he  supports.  His  references
represent  a  cross  section  of  Applicant’s  military,  governmental,  private  industry,  and
community  interactions.  Applicant  also  has been  personally  recognized  for his work in
support of forward-deployed military organizations. (Answer; AX 7; AX 8; Tr. 131)
