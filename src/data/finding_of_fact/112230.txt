Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.j, 1.l, 1.n, 1.p, 1.q, 1.u
through 1.w, 1.aa, and 1.dd through 1.kk. She denied the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.k, 1.m,
1.o, 1.r, 1.s, 1.t, 1.x, 1.y, 1.z, 1.bb, and 1.cc stating they were duplicates of debts she
admitted.  She  did  not  respond  to  SOR  ¶  1.ll,  and  it  will  be  considered  a  denial.  She
admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  2.a  and  2.b,  stating  she  made  an  error.  Her
explanation  will  be  considered  denials  for  those  two  allegations.  After  a  thorough  and
careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 46 years old. She married in 2003. She and her husband have been
separated at different times, but are reconciled. They have two children, ages 27 and 20
years old. In 2010, she earned an associate’s degree.1
Applicant disclosed on her May 2016 security clearance application (SCA) that she
had  been  employed  by  a  federal  contractor  since  May  2013,  but  has  had  periods  of
to  contract  changes.  Applicant  has  had  other  periods  of
unemployment  due
unemployment to include: February 2018 to May 2018; September 2012 to March 2013;
and May 2011 to August 2011. These may be periods when she was between contracts.
She testified that she has been working for a temporary agency since August 2018.2
Applicant attributed her financial problems to unemployment, underemployment,
lack of health insurance, and when she and her husband were separated. Their children
were minors when they were separated, and he did not pay child support. He occasionally
contributed to household expenses. She stated that in May 2011 she lost her job where
she had worked for more than seven years. She had some debts at that time. She did not
earn enough to pay her bills. She lost her health insurance when she was laid off. She
did not have medical insurance from approximately 2011 to 2016. She testified that she
has not intentionally neglected her debts, but she cannot afford to pay them.3
Applicant decided to go back to school in 2007 so she could earn more money.
She  needs  three  more  classes  to  earn  her  bachelor’s  degree.  She  accumulated  more
than  $80,000  in  student  loans.  She  testified  the  loans  were  deferred,  and  she  began
1 Tr. 17-18.
2 Tr. 18-24. On  her  SCA, Applicant disclosed she  was unemployed from May  2013 to July  2013 and  in
February 2014 which is inconsistent with her disclosure that she has been employed by a federal contractor
since May 2013.

making $120 payments in August 2018. The creditor wanted her to pay $400, but she
was able to defer that amount for six months. She testified that she now has a budget
and has $218 remaining at the end of the month after paying her bills.4
Applicant’s admissions, bankruptcy documents, and credit reports from September
2017 and July 2016, corroborate the SOR allegations.5 SOR ¶¶ 1.m, 1.s. 1.t, 1.y, 1.bb
and 1.cc are duplicate accounts of other allegations. I find in Applicant’s favor on these
allegations.6
In  January  2003,  Applicant  filed  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  and  her  debts  were
discharged in May 2003. She stated that she had two credit cards and medical debts, and
she was not managing her money properly at the time. The amount of the debts that were
discharged is unknown.7
In  February  2018,  Applicant  again  filed  Chapter  7  bankruptcy.  Her  debts  were
discharged in May 2018. It appears that the debts alleged in the SOR are included in this
bankruptcy  petition. The  debts  discharged were medical,  a  vehicle  loan,  a  credit  card,
satellite television, cell phone, and for an apartment. She stated a medical creditor placed
a lien on her checking account for a debt she owed from 2012, so she had to pay $75 a
month beginning in October 2017. She stated this payment was to a collection agency.
She stopped paying the account when she filed bankruptcy. She stated she also owed
her  state  taxing  authority  for  failure  to  have  insurance.  She  had  a  $100  balance  and
planned to pay it in two increments by November 2018. Applicant testified that prior to her
bankruptcy she was making small payments on some delinquent accounts.8
In April 2014, Applicant completed a Public Trust Position Questionnaire. Under
Section  22,  it  asked  if  she  was  over  180  days  delinquent  on  any  loan  or  financial
obligations. She answered “no.” At the time, Applicant had numerous delinquent debts
that she failed to disclose.9
When Applicant completed her SCA in May 2016, she answered “no” to all of the
questions  under  Section  26,  Financial  Delinquency  Involving  Routine  Accounts,  which
asked if in the past seven years she had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency;
and if she had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or canceled for failing
to pay as agreed.
4 Tr. 45-49, 61.
5 GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; AE A.
6 Applicant claimed other allegations were also duplicates. A review of the evidence supports that these
accounts have different numbers and were opened on different dates. See GE 2 and 3.
7 Tr. 58-59.
8 Tr. 32-58, 69-70, 75-76; GE 4.
9 GE 6.
Applicant testified that she misunderstood the questions when she answered “no.”
She  said  that  she  believed  that  she  had  disclosed  on  a  2014  Public  Trust  Position
Questionnaire the requested information and her current 2016 SCA had populated the
information, and she did not have to disclose it. She testified that she was aware of her
delinquent debts, but did not read the question, did not understand the question, or was
in a rush when completing the document. She stated she was aware that some medical
debts  had  been  turned  over  to  collection  accounts.  She  also  had  debts  that  became
delinquent after 2013, the date she said she completed an SCA. She also had debts that
were  more  than  180  days  when  she  completed  her  2014  Public  Trust  Position
Questionnaire,  but  did  not  disclose  them  on  that  document.  I  did  not  find  Applicant’s
testimony credible. I find she deliberately failed to disclose her delinquent debts on her
2014 Public Trust Position Questionnaire and 2016 SCA.10
Applicant’s  admissions,  testimony,  bankruptcy  documents,  and  credit  reports
corroborate  the  SOR  allegations.  Applicant  testified  that  she  completed  the  financial
counseling required to file bankruptcy.11
