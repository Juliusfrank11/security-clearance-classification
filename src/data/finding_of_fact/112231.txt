Applicant is 55 years old. She was widowed in 2012 and remarried in 2017. She
is  a  high  school  graduate  and  has  worked  for  her  current  employer  since  2011.
(Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A and 17; Applicant Exhibit C.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  she  has  failed  to  meet  her  financial  obligations  and  is  therefore  potentially
unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, and 1.i. She denied SOR allegations 1.c
through 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j through 1.w.
With regard to all of her financial issues Applicant maintained that her late husband
took care of the finances until his death. After his passing in 2012 Applicant stated that it
took her over two years to begin resolving her financial issues. However, Applicant was
often vague as to her knowledge of her past, or current, financial situation. (Tr. 42-43, 62-
65, 77-82.)
The SOR alleges in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b that Applicant failed to timely file
her Federal and state tax returns for at least tax years 2010 through 2015. The SOR was
amended at the hearing to add tax year 2016 in both allegations, in conformity with the
evidence  and  in  accordance  with  the  Directive,  Additional  Procedural  Guidance,
paragraph E3.1.17. (Tr. 99-101.)
In Section 26 of Applicant’s e-QIP (Government Exhibit 1) she admitted that she
had not filed Federal or state taxes for tax years 2010 through 2014. Asked for the reason
she stated, “late husband was the bookkeeper.”  She further stated that she was in the
process  of  finding  out  what  she  owed,  that  she  was  obtaining  tax  help,  and  that  back
taxes were being paid through garnishment.
1.a. Applicant admitted that she had not filed her Federal tax returns in a timely
manner from 2010 to at least 2015.
Documentation provided by Applicant from the IRS showed that she had not filed
her 2010 through 2014 Federal tax returns as of November 2017. Applicant testified that
she had prepared some of these returns by hand, however she also testified that she did
not know if these returns had ever been filed. She also stated that one or more of her
back  tax  returns  may  have  been  filed  by  a  tax  preparer  she  had  hired.  (Government
Exhibit 3 at 13-19; Tr. 30, 63-64, 88-89.)
Documentation provided by Applicant from the IRS showed that her 2015 Federal
tax  return  was  filed  August  15,  2016.  Additional  documentation  provided  by  Applicant
from her accountant showed that her 2016 Federal tax return was to be filed after March
31, 2018. I find that both returns were filed late. (Government Exhibit 3 at 12; Applicant
Exhibits K and M; Tr. 83-84.)
1.b. Applicant admitted that she had not filed her state tax returns for at least tax
years 2010 through 2015. Applicant stated at the hearing that she believed these returns
had been filed. However, other than the 2016 state tax return, she submitted no evidence
supporting her statement. (Government Exhibit 3 at 21; Applicant Exhibits K and M; Tr.
35-36, 88-89.)
Applicant  also  testified  that  she  had  paid  state  back  taxes  through  garnishment
and did not owe any money to the state. (Applicant Exhibit F; Tr. 36-38, 64-69.)
1.c.  Applicant  denied  in  her  March  2018  Answer  that  she  owed  the  Federal
Government $11,108.44 for 2010 back taxes, stating had not received any notice from
IRS.
Documentation  supplied  by  Applicant  from  the  IRS  showed  that  she  received
notice of this debt in November 2017. (Government Exhibit 3 at 18-19.)
Applicant testified that she believed all of her Federal back taxes had been paid
through assignment of her tax refund. However, documentation from the IRS provided by
Applicant after the hearing showed that she continued to owe $12,998.59 for that tax year.
This debt is not resolved. (Applicant Exhibit P; Tr. 33-35, 84-85.)
1.d.  Applicant  denied  in  her  Answer  that  she  owed  the  Federal  Government
$10,488.53 for 2011 back taxes, stating had not received any notice from IRS.
