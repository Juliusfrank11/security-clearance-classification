The SOR contains one allegation that Applicant did not file his Federal and state
tax returns for tax years 2009 through 2012. Applicant admitted that he failed to file the
returns  and  explained  that  when  employed  by  a  fast  food  restaurant  in  2009,  his
employer  inserted  an  incorrect  social  security  number  (SSN)  for  Applicant  on  his W-2
form and their personnel employment system records.
Applicant is 27 years old and single. He has a four-year-old daughter. He and the
daughter’s mother (former girlfriend) each have 50% custodial rights of the child. He has
been  working  as  a  helpdesk  administrator  since  April  2017.  Before  his  current  job,  he
was  employed  for  about  18  months  as  a  field  technician  for  a  public  school  system.
After  graduating  from  high  school,  Applicant  received  three  computer  certifications
between 2011 and 2013. Those certifications were in computer knowledge, networking
and security. This security clearance application is Applicant’s second. In 2012, he was
sponsored  for  a  security  clearance,  but  his  interim  clearance  was  denied  for unknown
reasons. (GE 1 at 11-30, 46; Tr. 6-13, 33)
Applicant’s tax problems started in tax year 2009, when his first employer, a fast
food operation, entered an incorrect SSN on his W-2 form, a document that an employer
must send to an employee and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) at the end of the tax
year. Two days before Applicant (19 years old at the time) was required to file the 2009
Federal  tax  return  (April  2010),  he  discovered  the  W-2  form  had  the  wrong  SSN.  He
filed  for  an  extension,  but  did  not  file  a  return  for  2009.  He  tried  unsuccessfully  to
contact his employer’s corporate offices. Then, Applicant informed his general manager
who responded that the SSN would be corrected. (GE 1 at 25-30; Tr. 22-24)
Later  in  2010,  Applicant  received  another  W-2  form  with  a  corrected  SSN.  He
spoke  with  a  family  friend  who  told  him  that  he  could  not  file  for  the  current  tax  year
unless he had filed for the previous tax year. Nonetheless, he filed for an extension for
2010 (April 2011) as he had done for 2009. However, he did not file the 2010, 2011, or
2012  Federal  and  state  tax  returns  because  he  was  still  guided  by  the  notion  that  he
could  not  file  for  current  tax  years  unless  he  had  filed  for  previous  tax  years.  He
remembered saving the W-2 forms for 2009 through 2012 tax years and intended to file
the  Federal  tax  returns.  Even  though  he  had  the  corrected  W-2  forms,  he  could  not
furnish a reason for not filing the federal tax returns. He eventually lost the 2009 through
2012  W-2  forms.  Applicant  claimed  that  after  he  was  told  in  2013  he  could  file  for
current  tax  years even  though  he  had not filed for previous  years,  he filed his Federal
and  state  tax  returns  for  all  subsequent  years.  Applicant  submitted  proof  that  he  filed
Federal  returns  for  tax  years  2013,  2014,  2015,  and  2016.  There  is  no  evidence  that
Applicant  owes  any  Federal or state  taxes for any  tax  year. (Answer to  SOR;  GE 3  at
18-26; Tr. 24-29)
In an effort to recover his W-2 forms for the missing Federal tax years, Applicant
tried to contact his previous employers, but received little cooperation from them, and in
some instances his phone calls were never returned. He claimed that he contacted the
IRS, but had no success. He entered the IRS website and obtained the tax transcripts
(GE 3), but only for the years he filed returns. He has been unable to speak with an IRS
representative because of his work hours. (Tr.29-31)
Applicant’s  post-hearing  documentation  consists  of  emails  explaining  his  efforts
to obtain the necessary Federal and state tax documentation. On September 17, 2018,
four days  after the  hearing  (September  13,  2018),  Applicant  reported  that  he  obtained
the state tax returns from 2013 to the present and would be submitting them at a later
time.  Regarding  the  missing  W-2  forms,  a  tax  preparer  service  informed  him  that  he
would have to fill out an application with the IRS. Then, it would take up to 10 days for
the IRS to send him the IRS income tax reports. Applicant did not believe he would be
able  to  retrieve  the  pertinent  documents  by  the  September  28,  2018  deadline  for
submitting post-hearing documents. (AE A at 1)
On  September  18,  2018,  Applicant  indicated  that  that  he  had  applied  for  a
personal identification number (PIN) with the IRS. He estimated that it would take up to
two weeks from September 18, 2018 (beyond the post-hearing deadline) to receive the
PIN and consult with the tax preparer service to process the return. He inquired whether
he  should  copy  and  submit  the  complete  state  tax  returns  or  just  the  first  page  of  the
return showing the stamp of the state tax agency. On September 25, 2018, Department
Counsel indicated no objection to an extension of the September 28, 2018 deadline for
submission of post-hearing documents. On September 26, 2018, I granted an extension
of the deadline to October 17, 2018. (AE A)
On October 16, 2018, Applicant provided an update of the difficulties confronted
in obtaining his W-2 forms so that he could file his tax returns. First, he was unable to
get the W-2 forms from most of his previous employers. He obtained the income reports
from  the  IRS,  but  they  do  not  contain  earned  income  numbers  (EIN)  for  previous
employers and state tax withholding information. One state tax agency in which he was
previously  employed  advised  him  that  they  do  not  retain  state  tax  withholding
information. The agency informed him that he would have to submit an application with
the Social Security Administration (SSA) to receive the missing W-2 forms. According to
the  form,  it  would  take  up  to  six  weeks  to  receive  copies  of  the  W-2  forms.  Then,  he
would  provide  W-2  forms  and  income  reports  to  his  tax  preparation  service  for
processing.  Applicant  requested  another  extension  of  deadline.  On  October  17,  2018,
Applicant’s  request  for  an  extension  was  granted  until  November  7,  2018.  No
documentation was presented. (AE A)
