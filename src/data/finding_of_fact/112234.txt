The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to file his federal (SOR ¶
1.a) and state (SOR ¶ 1.b) income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2016. Applicant
denied  the  allegations  and  indicated  that  there  were  extenuating  circumstances.  After
considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  53  years  old  and  a  computer  network  administrator.  He  has  an
Associate Degree in applied electronics technology awarded in May 1986. (GE 1; AEs A, I.)
He has worked for a succession of defense contractors at the same military installation
from August 1992 to October 2012 and from June 2014 to present.  He was granted a
secret clearance in 1994 that was renewed in 2007. (GE 1; AE I; Tr. 22-23, 26.)
Applicant and his spouse married in 2002. (GE 1.) She took responsibility for paying
the bills and completing and filing their income tax returns from the start of their marriage.
Their joint income tax returns were filed on time through tax year 2011, and they received
refunds. (Tr. 73-74.) Applicant’s spouse worked full time for a communications company for
almost 20 years. In August 2007, she acquired her real estate license. (Tr. 74.)
Applicant was unemployed from October 2012 until June 2014 for medical reasons.
He had major surgery in the fall of 2012 and, in June 2013, he developed serious medical
complications that resulted in him being placed in a medically-induced coma for 52 days.
He  had  subsequent  medical setbacks. (Tr. 75-81.)  During his lengthy unemployment,
Applicant’s spouse had a power-of-attorney to handle their finances. She had to reduce her
work hours as a realtor to be with him when he was hospitalized, and then care for him
when  he  was  home.  Applicant  had  some  unemployment  compensation  and  disability
income, but he also liquidated a 401(k) of approximately $152,000 in 2013, which paid for
COBRA medical insurance coverage and their mortgage when he was out of work. (Tr. 29-
31, 78-83.) Applicant’s spouse did not file federal or state income tax returns for tax year
2012, and their federal return for tax year 2013.1 (GEs 1-2; AEs C-D, Tr. 55-57.) Their tax
returns were complicated because of several withdrawals from retirement accounts and her
business expenses as a self-employed realtor. (Tr. 56.)
Applicant returned to work in June 2014 for a defense contractor at a nearby military
installation located in a state that collects taxes on non-residents that earn income in the
state. (Tr. 32, 66-67.) Applicant assumed that federal and non-resident state taxes were
withheld from his pay. Apparently only recently, he learned that non-resident state income
taxes had not been withheld from his pay, and he rectified his withholding issue.2 (Tr. 59.)
On  March  16,  2015,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to an inquiry concerning
whether he had failed to file or pay and Federal, state, or other taxes by law or ordinance in
the last seven years, Applicant indicated that he had not filed federal or state income tax
returns for tax years 2012 and 2013. He explained that he had been hospitalized for an
extended time and was not able to file his tax returns for those tax years. During tax year
2013, he prematurely withdrew retirement assets. He indicated that he would file his 2012
and 2013 tax returns at the same time, and that he expected refunds for tax year 2012,
which he would use to pay any taxes owed for 2013. (GE 1.) Applicant relied on his spouse
to file their income tax returns because she itemized her self-employment expenses. (Tr.
67.)
Applicant and his spouse filed their joint federal income tax return for tax year 2012
on August 3, 2015. On adjusted gross income of $54,999, they were entitled to a $4,889
refund. (AE C.) They filed their federal income tax return for tax year 2013 on August 17,
2015. On adjusted gross income of $121,052, they underpaid their federal income taxes by
$6,071 for tax year 2013. Their federal income tax refund for tax year 2012 was applied to
their tax liability for tax year 2013. (AEs C-D.) With assessed penalties and interest, they
owed approximately $1,618, which they paid. (GE 2; AE D.) Applicant did not present any
documentation of his state income tax return for tax year 2012. Applicant’s spouse testified
about 2012 and 2013 that they owed minimal state taxes for one year and were entitled to
a refund of approximately $2,200 for the other tax year. She advised the state to apply it to
any taxes owed for subsequent tax years. (Tr. 94-95.)
In 2015, Applicant’s parents-in-law were both diagnosed with cancer. Applicant’s
spouse put her realtor license in inactive status, and she took on caregiver responsibilities
1 It is unclear whether Applicant and his spouse were required to file a state income tax return for tax year
2013. He was unemployed that entire year, and there is no evidence that his spouse earned income in a state
that taxes employment income. There is no evidence that they were required to file a state return because of
his premature withdrawal of retirement assets.
2 Applicant did not indicate when he learned state taxes had not been withheld from his pay. His and his
spouse’s joint income tax return for 2017 shows that no state income taxes were withheld for that tax year.
(AE H.) What is clear is that no taxes were withheld before 2018, so his rectification of the issue is recent.
for  her  parents.  Her  father  died  in  early  September  2018.  (Tr.  85-86,  98.)  She  felt
overwhelmed by all of her obligations, and she did not file Applicant and her joint federal or
state income tax returns when they were due for tax years 2014 through 2016. (Tr. 69.)
Applicant took no responsibility for filing their returns. His spouse had gathered most of the
paperwork and thought she could handle it. (Tr. 99.)
On May 3, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He volunteered that he and his spouse had yet to
file their federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2014 and 2015, but that his
spouse was working on them. He expressed hope that she would complete their returns for
2014 and 2015 within the next week. He also indicated that their delinquent tax returns for
2012 and 2013 were filed late; that they owed no federal or state income taxes for tax year
2012, or state income taxes for 2013; and that they have paid their federal tax debt of
about $1,500 for tax year 2013. Applicant expected to owe no tax debt for tax years 2014
and 2015. He told the OPM investigator that he and his spouse “just now have time to sit
down and figure [their taxes] out.”  (GE 2.)
In September 2017, the DOD CAF requested information from Applicant about his
tax situation. On September 22, 2017, Applicant’s spouse indicated that she is responsible
for their tax filing and that she was “almost finished with 2014 and have 2015 and 2016 set
up to complete as possible.” She requested an extension of time for Applicant because of
health issues with her parents, and she is their closest caregiver. Applicant was granted an
extension to October 23, 2017, to respond to the DOD CAF’s request. On October 27,
2017,  Applicant’s  spouse  responded  that  they  worked  hard  to  meet  the  deadline  but
“circumstances  beyond  [their]  control  have  made  it  impossible  to  get  all  the  returns
completed.”  Applicant’s  spouse  indicated  that  her  father  was  scheduled  for  upcoming
surgery, and she asked for more time. She added that she would continue to work on
completing their tax returns. (GE 5.)
On December 8, 2017, the DOD CAF issued a SOR to Applicant because of his
failure to file federal and state tax returns by the filing deadlines for tax years 2012 through
2016. In February 2018, Applicant and his spouse retained the services of an enrolled tax
agent to assist them in preparing their delinquent income tax returns for tax years 2014
through 2016. (Tr. 87-88.)
With the assistance of the tax agent, Applicant and his spouse filed their federal
income tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016 on June 13, 2018. (AEs F-G.) Their state
income tax returns were for tax years 2015 and 2016 were completed on June 13, 2018,
but were not mailed until the week of September 9, 2018. (Tr. 98.) On joint adjusted gross
income of $57,384 in 2015, they overpaid their federal income taxes by $798. Their refund
was issued to them on July 9, 2018. (AE F.) No state taxes had been withheld from his pay
for tax year 2015, which resulted in a tax underpayment of $1,420. With penalties for late
payment, they owed state taxes of $1,987 for tax year 2015. (AE F.) On adjusted gross
income of $57,159 in 2016, they overpaid their federal income taxes by $666. Their refund
was issued to them on July 9, 2018. No state taxes were withheld from his pay for tax year
2016, and with penalties for failure to timely file and pay, they owed $1,747 in state taxes
for tax year 2016. (AE G.)
Through the enrolled tax agent, Applicant and his spouse requested an extension to
October 15, 2018, to file their federal tax return for tax year 2017. On June 13, 2018, they
timely filed their federal return for tax year 2017. On adjusted gross income of $50,931 for
tax year 2017, they overpaid their federal income taxes by $1,695. Their refund was issued
to  them  on  June  27,  2018.  As  with  previous  tax  years, no  state  income  tax  had  been
withheld from Applicant’s pay. As a result, they underpaid their non-resident state income
taxes by $1,119. With a $45 underpayment penalty, they owed the state $1,197. (AE H.)
They mailed their state income tax return for tax year 2017 sometime during the week of
September 9, 2018. (Tr. 98.)
Also  on  June  13,  2018,  the  tax  agent  finished  Applicant  and  his  spouse’s  joint
federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2014. Based on the returns, Applicant and
his spouse underpaid their federal income taxes by $156 and their state income taxes by
$135  ($201  with  penalties)  for  tax  year  2014.  The  tax  returns  could  not  be  submitted
electronically, so the tax agent gave them to Applicant’s spouse to mail. As of September
10, 2018, the IRS had no record of Applicant and his spouse filing an income tax return for
tax  year  2014.  (AE  E.)  Applicant’s  spouse  did  not  file  the  returns  until  the  week  of
September 9, 2018, because she waited to see whether the IRS and state tax authority
would take part of their refunds for previous years and apply them to their tax liabilities.
Applicant and his spouse paid the taxes owed for tax year 2014 when she mailed the
returns  the  week  before  his  security  clearance  hearing.  (Tr.  89-90.)  Applicant  and  his
spouse have not yet been billed for any delinquent state taxes, so they have not satisfied
their state tax liabilities for 2015 through 2017, which totaled $4,931 per their returns. They
are not sure what they owe. (Tr. 94.)
Applicant’s spouse attributes her delay in addressing their tax filings to her parents’
and her own medical issues, including since April 2017. Her father had an operation in
October 2017, and he died in early September 2018. (Tr. 66, 86. 90.) She assumed that
they did not owe taxes because they “had paid the taxes as [they] went along for the most
part and it was just the reconciliation part that [she] didn’t have time to deal with because of
all the medical.” (Tr. 102.) Applicant has recently taken on repayment responsibility for
some of the household expenses. (Tr. 91.) They intend to retain the services of the tax
agent to prepare their future income tax returns. (Tr. 87, 93, 95, 99.)
As of April 2018, Applicant had some outstanding medical collection debt on his
credit  record:  $85  from  May  2015;  $1,211  (disputed)  from  November  2012;  $66  from
September 2015; and $321 from May 2017. They were making timely payments of $1,256
per month on their mortgage loan obtained in May 2003. As of April 2018, the loan balance
was $93,538. Applicant was paying $262 per month on a credit card with a current balance
of $12,818. He had been late 30 days in August 2017 on a car lease payment of $186 per
month, but had been current since then. (AE I.)
Applicant received several awards from a previous employer for his dedication and
valuable contributions in support of the military installation. (AE A.) In October 2012, he
received a letter of appreciation from his military customer for his expertise on high-priority
projects. (AE B.) Applicant completed voluntary training over the years to ensure that he
continues to perform his duties in information systems security with professionalism and
high quality. (AE A.)
Applicant  has  the  strong  endorsement  of  present  and  former  co-workers,  who
consider him to be a network administrator of the highest quality. Applicant is relied on for
his  knowledge  and  research.  He  has  worked  on  “countless  tasks  and  projects  with
sensitive  and  secret  information”  and  respected  privacy  and  security  requirements.
Applicant is known for giving security issues priority and resolving them in a timely manner.
