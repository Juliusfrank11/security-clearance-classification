Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c - 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.l - 1.o, and she denied SOR
¶¶  1.b,  1.f,  1.i,  1.j,  1.k,  and  1.p  -  1.t.  She  admitted  SOR  ¶  1.u  during  her  hearing
testimony.  Her  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  46  years  old.  She  was  married  from  1997  to  2011.  She  has  two
children:  a  daughter,  age  19,  and  a  son,  age  17.  Both  children  live  at  home  with  her.
Her  daughter  attends  junior  college  and  her  son  is  a  high  school  senior.  Applicant
remarried in May 2015 and divorced a year later, in February 2017. (Tr. 29-31; 91; AE
D; GE 1)
Applicant  served  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  1997  to  1999.  She  was  discharged
honorably after she became pregnant with her first child. (Tr. 36; GE 1) She has earned
a bachelor’s degree, and has had subsequent schooling. (Tr. 35-36)
2 AE A through AE C were attached to Applicant’s Answer.
3 Tr. 47, 101-103. The motion was granted without objection. During the hearing, I erroneously referenced
the new allegation as “SOR ¶ 1.m,” instead of by  what came next in the sequence (SOR ¶ 1.u)  as it is
identified here.
Applicant  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  2004.  She  worked  for  defense
contractor B from 2004 until November 2012. She then took a new contractor position,
where she worked until she was furloughed, in July 2013. Over the next five years, she
was  employed  from  September  2013  to  January  2014;  laid  off  and  unemployed  until
March  2014;  employed  again  until  November  2016;  and  laid  off  and  unemployed  until
January  2017.  Since  then,  she  has  been  employed  as  a  software  developer  for  her
current employer and clearance sponsor. She earns $100,000 annually. (Tr. 36-41, 94-
95; GE 1; AE D)
Applicant  enrolled  her  children  into  private  school  from  about  2011  to  2013,
because  they  were  being  bullied  in  public  school.  (Tr.  92-94;  AE  D)  In  2012,  after
leaving  her  job  with  defense  contractor  B,  Applicant  cashed  out  her  401(k),  taking  out
about $25,000. She used the 401(k) money to finance her children’s tuition and to pay
off  several  consumer  debts.  (Tr.  44-45)  After  2013,  Applicant  returned  her  children  to
public school after she moved. She also was not able to afford private tuition. (Tr. 93)
Applicant  was  not  aware  that  an  early  withdrawal  from  her  401(k)  caused  tax
consequences,  so  she  did  not  pay  taxes  on  that  income  at  the  time.  SOR  ¶  1.a  is  a
state  tax  lien  issued  in  2016  for  $5,904.  When  Applicant  learned  of  the  tax  debt,  she
contacted tax authorities and attempted to repay it, but she stopped making payments
after  she  was  laid  off  in  late  2016.  (Tr.  34,  43-45,  52)  She  did  not  make  further
repayment efforts until after the SOR. (Tr. 34, 52-53)
AE F reflects payment plans for two state tax debts. One is for Applicant and her
former  spouse,  though  Applicant  is  responsible  for  it.  Applicant  is  to  pay  about  $67  a
month for 12 months (on one $765 state tax debt). Under the second plan, Applicant is
to  pay  $184  a  month  for  36  months  (on  another  state  tax  debt,  of  about  $6,000).  The
repayment  agreements  are  in  place  as  of  August  15,  2018,  but  no  evidence  of
payments was submitted. (Tr. 53-55; AE F)
In  2017,  Applicant  also  learned  that  she  owed  federal  taxes  as  a  result  of  her
early  401(k)  withdrawal.  She  testified  that  she  owed  about  $12,000  in  federal  income
taxes.  She  said  the  IRS  has  kept  about  $6,000  of  her  federal  refunds  to  resolve  this
debt.  She  has  about  $6,000  left  to  pay.  (Tr.  44,  47-49)  (SOR  ¶  1.u)  Applicant  did  not
provide  any  documentation  to  corroborate her  testimony.  She has  not taken any  other
steps to repay her federal tax debt.
Applicant  asserted  that  the  credit  reports  (GE  2,  GE  3)  contain  incorrect
information  and  that  many  of  her  debts  are  resolved,  either  because  they  are  now  in
good standing, or because they no longer appear on her credit reports. (AE D) She said
she  contacted  the  credit  bureaus  to  address  the  errors  and  dispute  them.  (Tr.  13,  32,
107) She provided more recent credit reports which do not show all of the debts alleged.
(AE A; AE G)
SOR  ¶  1.b  is  a  2012  judgment  against  Applicant  in  favor  of  creditor  M,  a
collection agency, for $1,577. (GE 2 at 3; GE 3 at 3) Applicant asserted that the debt is
the same as SOR ¶ 1.s ($1,897), a past-due credit card account issued by Bank C and
reported to collection agency M. (GE 3 at 12) Applicant denied both debts because they
are no longer listed on her credit reports. (AE A; AE G) She also said she never had a
credit card with Bank C. (Tr. 55-62)
SOR  ¶¶  1.c  ($21,261),  1.d  ($9,112),  1.e  ($9,915),  1.l  ($19,398),  1.m  ($12,931),
1.n ($9,372), and 1.o ($2,835) are past-due private student loan debts. As alleged, they
total about $85,000. However, they are based on two separate credit reports, and some
are duplicates. SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.e are the same debt. They are to the same creditor,
were both opened in October 2011, and have almost identical account numbers. (GE 2
at 4) SOR ¶ 1.l (listed on GE 3 at 3) is also a duplicate of debt ¶ 1.c.
Applicant’s  student  loans  were  deferred  for  several  years.  They  became
delinquent  during  her  divorce  (2011-2012),  though  she  only  learned  this  later.  (Tr.  33,
63) She consolidated most of her student loans in 2015. (AE C; AE E) She documented
that four of her loans (totaling about $34,600) were consolidated and “paid in full” by the
U.  S.  Department  of  Education  in  2015.  (AE  E)  Applicant  acknowledged  that  she  still
has to repay the loans, but now owes the federal government instead of private lenders.
Applicant believes she owes between $40,000 and $60,000 overall. (Tr. 63-72)
All but one of Applicant’s student loans are again in deferment. She neglected to
include one of her private loans (it is not clear which one) in consolidation. She intends
to  keep her  student  loans in  deferment  while  her  children  are  in  school. She  hopes  to
begin repayment in 2019 or 2020. (Tr. 69-74)
SOR  ¶  1.f  ($3,242)  is  a  charged-off  debt  relating  to  an  old  computer  purchase.
SOR ¶ 1.q ($1,714) is the same debt. The account numbers are the same, the creditors
have the same initials and the two accounts are listed on separate credit reports. (GE 2
at 4; GE 3 at 5) Applicant acknowledged that one  of the debts is valid. She contacted
the  creditor  to  try  to  settle  the  debt,  and  intends  to  pay  it.  (Tr.  75-77)  SOR  ¶  1.q  is  a
duplicate, but SOR ¶ 1.f remains unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.g ($68) is a charged-off debt to a credit union at a military base where
Applicant used to work, from 2009 to 2013. It remains listed on her credit reports and is
unpaid. (GE 2 at 4; AE A at 34; AE G at 1-2). Applicant intends to pay it. (Tr. 76-78)
SOR ¶¶ 1.h ($1,059) and 1.t ($1,081) are the same debt. The bank, the collection
agency, and the account numbers are the same. (GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 78-82). SOR ¶ 1.t is a
duplicate, but SOR ¶ 1.h remains unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.i ($1,029) is a debt placed in collection by a bank. It became delinquent
in about 2010. Applicant believes it has been paid. Applicant recently disputed the debt
with  credit  bureaus.  (Tr.  79-83;  GE  2  at  11)  She  provided  no  corroborating
documentation. The account remains unresolved.
SOR  ¶ 1.j  ($695)  is  an  old, past-due  utility  bill,  incurred  when Applicant  lived  in
another  state  during  her  first  marriage.  (GE  2  at  11)  Applicant  disputed  it  with  the
creditor,  and  asserts  that  it  was  removed  from  her  credit  report.  (Tr.  82-87)  She
provided no corroborating documentation. The account remains unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.k ($185) is a past-due debt to a cable company. (GE 2 at 11) Applicant
said it is an old bill and that it has been paid. She said she contacted the cable company
for verification. (Tr. 85-87) She provided no corroborating documentation. The account
remains unresolved.
SOR  ¶  1.p  ($1,824)  is  a  past-due  debt  owed  to  a  department  store.  Applicant
denied  the  debt,  which  has  been  pending  since  2010.  She  intends  to  pay  it,  but  it
remains unresolved. (Tr. 88; GE 3 at 5)
SOR ¶ 1.r ($1,509) is a past-due credit card account issued by a large hardware
store. (GE 3 at 5). It has been pending since 2010. Applicant intends to pay it. (Tr. 89)
Applicant  declared  several  delinquent  debts  on  her  SCA,  in  2015,  noting  that
many were due to her first divorce. She did little to try to resolve them until she received
the  SOR.  This  was  due,  in  part,  to  her  somewhat  sporadic  employment  situation,  but
she also acknowledged that she did not pay attention to her finances. (Tr. 95-98; GE 1;
AE D) Currently, Applicant is living paycheck-to-paycheck. She has little money saved.
She  pays  $1,575  in  rent.  She  bought  a  used  car  in  2017.  She  pays  for  some  of  her
daughter’s college expenses. (Tr. 49-52)
Applicant began a credit counseling program two months before the hearing. She
learned about a well-known credit counselor’s “snowball” method of repayment (paying
the  smallest  debt first,  then  the next  smallest, and  so  on).  She  intends to address  her
debts one by one in this way, while also paying her tax debts, and then addressing her
student loans at a later date. She also has learned how to keep a monthly budget. (Tr.
88-90, 95-96, 108)
A  co-worker  and  supervisor  who  hired  Applicant  for  her  current  job  attests  that
Applicant  is  a  knowledgeable  professional.  She  is  also  honest,  trustworthy,  hard-
wording,  and  loyal.  She  maintains  confidentiality  and  has  been  entrusted  to  maintain
access to sensitive information without issues. (AE H)
