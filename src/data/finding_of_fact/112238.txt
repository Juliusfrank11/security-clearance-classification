Applicant denies the SOR allegations, except for SOR 1.a-1.d and 1.f. She is a
43-year-old  senior  information  systems  technician  employed  by  a  U.S.  defense
contractor  since  September  2015.  She  has  held  similar  jobs  since  December  2004,
except for being unemployed from October to November 2009, November 2013 to June
2014, and from July to August 2015.  She received a clearance in November 2006, but
gaps  in  her  contractor  employment  required  the  new  application  in  December  2015
(Item 3).
The  SOR  alleges,  and  Government  exhibits  (Items  4-6)  establish,11  delinquent
debts  totaling  over  $53,000.  However,  record  evidence  shows  that  the  October  2017
balance  for  SOR  1.a  was  $7,335  (Item  6)  and  the  January  2016  balance  for  SOR  1.e
was $12,975 (Item 5). Consequently,  the balance at issue is nearly $27,000. Applicant
claims, without corroboration that SOR 1.a and SOR 1.e are the same account.3
The debts comprise three automobile repossessions totaling nearly $24,000 (SOR
1.a-1.b and 1.e), four delinquent medical accounts totaling $1,000 (SOR 1.c and 1.i-1.k),
two delinquent cable accounts (SOR 1.g-1.h) and two consumer credit accounts totaling
$500  (SOR  1.d  and  1.f).  Applicant  listed  none  of  these  debts  on  her  December  2015
clearance  application  (Item  4),  but  was  confronted  with  them  during  interviews  with  a
Government investigator on 6 June and 25 July 2017 (Item 4). She claimed to have been
unaware  of  the  SOR  debts  until  she  was  confronted  with  them.  However,  all  the  SOR
debts were in various stages of delinquency before December 2015. Nevertheless, she
stated her intent to address the listed debts.
Applicant documented no efforts to address her debts, either after her interview or
after she received the SOR. She attributed her financial problems to her unemployment
periods and her husbandâ€™s retirement. However, she provided no evidence to show how
these  events  changed  her  financial posture.  Moreover,  her  most  recent  unemployment
period  was  barely  more  than  a  month  long.  She  provided  no  budget  or  financial
statement. She has not documented any financial or credit counseling. She provided no
work or character references, or any evidence of community involvement.
