The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of February 15, 2018, Applicant owed
$24,594 in defaulted Federal student-loan debt (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.j), a $116 medical collection
debt  (SOR  ¶  1.k),  and  state  education  debts  in  collection  for  $2,978  (SOR  ¶  1.l)  and
$10,185 (SOR ¶ 1.m). In his Answer to the SOR (Item 2), Applicant admitted the debts, but
he  also  provided  payment  receipts  to  show  that  the  amount  of  his  indebtedness  was
incorrect. After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant’s Answer to the SOR (Item
2), and AE A, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 27 years old and married. He graduated from high school in June 2009
and pursued university studies between August 2009 and May 2014 with a break from
September 2010 to January 2012.1  He has yet to earn a degree. Applicant has been a
member of the National Guard since November 2010. He has worked part time or full time
for several companies as a security guard since March 2013, at times holding more than
one job. As of May 2016, Applicant was being sponsored for security clearance eligibility
for part-time work as a security guard on a military base.2 (Item 3.)
1 Applicant indicated on his SF 86 that he attended college from August 2009 to September 2010 and resumed
his studies at a different university from August 2012 to May 2014. (Item 3.) He discrepantly advised an Office
of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator in March 2017 that he had withdrawn from the first university in
September 2011. (Item 4.) Available credit reports show no Federal student loans obtained after the spring
semester of 2010 until the spring semester of 2012. His tuition debt to the first university was in collection for
$10,185 as of October 2011.
2 At my request, Department Counsel confirmed in October 2018 that Applicant was still being sponsored for
security clearance eligibility by the employer listed first in response to the employment activities inquiry on his
May 2016 security clearance application (SF 86). I marked his email noting the sponsorship as a file exhibit for
the administrative record. Applicant told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that he left
the company in June 2016 after less than one month for a full-time position with another Federal contractor.
Applicant obtained ten Federal student loans for college totaling $22,379 between
October  2009  and  January  2014  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.j).  He  incurred  another  $10,185  in
educational debt to the university that he attended from August 2009 to September 2010.
(Item 3.) Applicant withdrew from the university only two or three days into the semester
when his mother became ill, but it was too late to negate his tuition obligation. He could not
afford to make the initial payment, which was 20% of the balance owed. As of October
2011, his account was in collection for $10,185 (SOR ¶ 1.m). (Items 3-4.)
Applicant  was  unemployed  until  November  2010,  when  he  joined  the  National
Guard. He had no other income apart from his part-time Guard duties until October 2012,
when he began working as a bouncer at a bar on the weekends. He resumed his college
studies at another state university in 2012, and his Federal student loans were deferred. In
March 2013, he began working full time as a night-shift supervisor for a company that
provides mall security while continuing to take college classes and work as a bouncer. In
March 2015, he took on a part-time job as a security guard with a security company. Five
months later, he was offered a full-time position with the security company, and he left his
job  in  mall security.  In January 2016, he began working for company X  as a part-time
“Federal armed security officer” while also working for the security company. In May 2016,
he took on another part-time job, as a security officer on a military base for his current
employer. (Item 3.)
Needing  a  clearance  for  his  job  on  the  military  base,  Applicant  completed  and
certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on May
11, 2016. He listed his civilian employments and also his Guard duty. He indicated that he
had been investigated for a security clearance for his duties with company X, but he had
not  been  granted  a  clearance.  He  listed  a  Secret  clearance  granted  to  him  in  2011,
presumably for his Guard duties. In response to the financial record inquiries, Applicant
disclosed that he owed approximately $26,000 in delinquent Federal student loans and
explained:
A payment plan exists it was set up in 2014, no payments have been made
as of yet because the loan[s] were deferred up until February (est) of this
year. Payment should still be defed [sic] as I am enrolled in the [military]
Student Loan repayment. I am 87 Days Delinquent.
Applicant added that he would establish a payment plan as soon as he returned to a
full-time  position.  Applicant  also  indicated  that  he  owed  $9,997  (SOR  ¶  1.m)  to  the
university he first attended because he had withdrawn from classes. He added that the
state  withheld  his income  tax  refund  for tax  year 2015,  but  that  the  debt  was  not  fully
resolved. Applicant disclosed another $3,500 debt (SOR ¶ 1.l) for his college studies in
2014.  Under  the  additional  comment  section,  Applicant  explained  that  his  educational
debts to the state were in the process of being placed on a repayment plan. (Item 3.)
As of August 2016, Applicant’s Federal student-loan debt had accrued to $25,610.
He was in default since May 2016, when his loans came out of deferment.  His student
(Item 4.)
debts with the state were in collection for $10,185 and $2,978. Applicant was making timely
payments of $279 per month on an $11,205 five-year auto loan obtained in July 2015. He
had three open credit card accounts that were rated as current. (Item 5.)
In  January  2017,  Applicant  left  his  employment  with  company  X  because  of  a
military  deployment  with  his Guard  unit.  He was on a military installation preparing for
deployment when, on March 2, 2017, he was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  He provided the OPM investigator with a
letter from the U.S. Department of Education notifying him that his loans were in default
and that he had 60 days to make repayment arrangements before his default status would
be reported to the credit bureaus. The balance of his loans was then $27,054 ($25,690 in
principal and $1,364 in interest). (Item 7.) He could not afford the $275 monthly payments
initially required in repayment because of a lack of full-time work. Applicant acknowledged
that the loans had been  87 days delinquent as of May 2016, but he was enrolled in a
military  student-loan  repayment  program.  He  expressed  his  intention  to  immediately
arrange for repayment and to pay at least $500 per month toward the loans during his
impending deployment from April 2017 to April 2018.3 About his state education debts,
Applicant explained that he became delinquent on the account in SOR ¶ 1.m one year after
he withdrew from the university, and he could not afford the required first payment of 20%
of the balance. The other debt (SOR ¶ 1.l) became delinquent in August 2015. He provided
evidence of a $200 payment in February 2017, which was allocated between his two state
debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.l and 1.m), and added that the state took his $600 income tax refund in
partial  repayment.  He  expressed  an  intention  to  continue  to  make  $200  payments.
Applicant described his financial situation as good in that he was meeting his financial
obligations on time. (Item 4.)
On February 28, 2017, Applicant was re-interviewed by the OPM investigator about
his college debts. He provided documentation showing that the state withheld his income
tax refund of $607, and that he made payments of $200 on January 23, 2017, and again
on March 5, 2017, which were split between his two accounts. Applicant was re-contacted
about the debts on May 9, 2017, but was unable to provide any additional information.
(Item 4.)
As  of  late  October  2017,  Equifax  was  reporting  that  Applicant  owed  past-due
Federal student loan balances totaling $26,416. A $116 medical debt from December 2016
had been placed for collection in May 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.k). Applicant had not been late on his
car loan or credit-card payments. (Item 6.)
On February 15, 2018, the DOD CAF issued a SOR to Applicant because of his
college debts and the $116 medical collection debt. (Item 1.) Applicant asserted in April
2018 that his Federal student loans were now current. He explained that, in the process of
moving, he was not aware that his Federal student loans had become 180 days overdue.
He provided documentation showing that he made $200 monthly payments from March 14,
3 Applicant had apparently not been deployed as of May 9, 2017, when he was interviewed in person by an
OPM investigator. The investigator subsequently had no success in contacting Applicant because he was
deployed until January 2018. (Item 4.)
2017, through March 8, 2018, toward his Federal loans, of which almost $1,895 went to
pay interest on the loans in 2017. Applicant maintained that he had paid the $116 medical
collection debt, although he provided no proof. He provided documentation of credit-card
payments totaling $3,003 between January 23, 2017, and December 8, 2017, to resolve
the college debt in SOR ¶ 1.l, and of three credit-card payments of $100 each between
January 2017 and May 2017 toward his debt in SOR ¶ 1.m. (Item 2.) In rebuttal to the
FORM, Applicant provided a payment receipt showing that the debt in SOR ¶ 1.m was fully
satisfied as of December 11, 2017, with $2,977.95 collected by the state at that time. (AE
A.)
On July 23, 2018, Applicant entered into a formal loan rehabilitation program for his
Federal student loans then totaling $25,609, inclusive of interest. Applicant agreed to make
at  least  nine  monthly  payments  of  $228 beginning on July 28, 2018. Because he was
rehabilitating Direct Loans (Item 7), he was required to complete the initial payment and at
least eight of the other required monthly payments within a ten month period starting in July
2018.  On  rehabilitation  of  the  loans,  the  loan  servicer will set a new monthly payment
amount and due date. (AE A.)
