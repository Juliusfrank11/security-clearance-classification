In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the initial
SOR (SOR ¶ 1.a.). Applicant did not admit or deny SOR ¶ 1.b., but merely acknowledged
and conceded the concerns, so a denial was registered as to that allegation. Applicant’s
admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete
and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same,
I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a systems analyst with his current employer since December 2016. He is a 1988 high
school graduate, and received an associate’s degree in 1992. In 1995-1996, he was an
ordained minister. Applicant has never served with the U.S. military. He has never held a
position of public trust. Applicant was married in 1996, separated in 2014, and divorced
in 2017. He remarried in April 2018. He has two children, born in 1999 and 2001.

Financial Considerations2
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  several  different  factors:  he  had
personal  family  life  issues  involving  a  wife  who  lost  her  teaching  position;  she
mismanaged their money and “self-medicated” by spending money on clothing and eating
out; she totaled her vehicle; estate tax issues arose involving an estate inherited by his
wife; more tax issues arose in 2011 over capital gains when he cashed in a pension plan
to generate funds to enable him to resolve some of his growing financial debt; their house
was foreclosed in 2013; he was unemployed from May 2014 until August 2014; his federal
income tax refund for the tax year 2016 was withheld by the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) and applied to his outstanding tax debt; and Applicant and his wife were separated
for three years before finally divorcing. In addition, although they shared custody of the
children, Applicant kept physical custody of their children and did not receive any financial
support from his wife.3
When Applicant completed his e-QIP in February 2017, he reported that he had
failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for the tax years 2012 through
2015,  and  that  he  had  failed  to  pay  his  federal  and  state  taxes  for  the  same  period.4
However,  during  his  interview  with  an  investigator  from  the  U.S.  Office  of  Personnel
Management (OPM) in August 2017, Applicant changed the narrative and contended he
had timely filed his income tax returns for that period, and was sent refunds, claiming his
e-QIP entries were in error.5 In his Answer to the SOR and during the hearing, Applicant
acknowledged that the filings had not yet taken place.6 Although he claimed that he had,
at one point, entered into an Installment Agreement with the IRS, he acknowledged that
he had failed to make any payments under it for fear that his checks might bounce. He
also  denied  that  he  has  been  in  contact,  in  writing  or  by  telephone,  with  the  IRS  for
approximately five years for anything associated with those tax years.7 During his hearing,
Applicant said that he was now in a position to start paying his delinquent taxes and some
retail credit debt about which he was not aware.8

delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and
otherwise  acting  in  a  financially  responsible  manner.  ISCR  Case  No.  07-13041  at  4  (App.  Bd.  Sep.  19,

In August 2018, Applicant asserted that he had finally filed his federal income tax
returns  for  the  tax  years  2010  through  2016.9  The  U.S.  Individual  Income  Tax  Return
(Form 1040) for 2010, reflecting an adjusted gross income of $82,032, was dated August
1, 2018;10 the Forms 1040 for 2011, reflecting an adjusted gross income of $76,945,11
and 2012, reflecting an adjusted gross income of $76,969,12 were dated August 2, 2018;
the  Form  1040  for  2013,  reflecting  an  adjusted  gross  income  of  $46,229,  was  dated
August  3,  2018;13  the  Form  1040  for  2014,  reflecting  an  adjusted  gross  income  of
$58,427,  was  dated  August  5,  2018;14  and  the  Forms  1040  for  2015,  reflecting  an
adjusted gross income of $72,246,15 and 2016, reflecting an adjusted gross income of
$72,515,16 were dated August 6, 2018 – all clearly beyond the required initial or extended
dates of filing.17
On  August  10,  2018,  Applicant  submitted  an  Installment  Agreement  Request
(Form 9465) to the IRS, stating that he owed the IRS $12,506 in unpaid taxes, interest,
and  penalties,  and  offered  to  pay  the  IRS  a  monthly  $340  under  the  requested

17  The  legal  requirement  to  file  a  federal  income  tax  return  is  based  upon  an  individual’s  gross
income and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined that there is an obligation to so file, the
following applies:
Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title
or  by  regulations  made  under  authority  thereof  to  make  a  return,  keep  any  records,  or
supply  any  information,  who  willfully  fails  to  pay  such  estimated  tax  or  tax,  make  such
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law
or  regulations,  shall,  in  addition  to  other  penalties  provided  by  law,  be  guilty  of  a
misdemeanor  and,  upon  conviction  thereof,  shall  be  fined  not  more  than  $25,000
($100,000  in  the  case  of  a  corporation),  or  imprisoned  not  more  than  1  year,  or  both,
together  with  the  costs  of  prosecution.  In  the  case  of  any  person  with  respect  to  whom
there is a failure to pay any estimated tax, this section shall not apply to such person with
respect to such failure if there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect
to such failure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the first
sentence of this section shall be applied by substituting "felony" for "misdemeanor" and "5
years" for "1 year."

agreement.18 He sent a check to the IRS for $300 that same day.19 Applicant offered no
documentation from the IRS to indicate that his Installment Agreement Request had been
approved.  In  addition,  he  offered  no  explanation  for  paying  the  IRS  less  than  he  had
promised to pay under the Installment Agreement Request, or if he had continued making
subsequent payments in compliance with the proposed Request.
In addition to his difficulties with respect to his federal income tax returns and the
taxes he still owes the IRS, Applicant also had two delinquent debts that were not alleged
in the SOR.20 Although one account became delinquent in 2011 and the other account
became  delinquent  in  2017,  and  at  least  one  of  them  was  discussed  during  his  OPM
interview in August 2017, Applicant did not attempt to resolve one debt until he made a
payment  of  $295.94  on  July  31,  2018,  thereby  paying  it  off.21  During  the  hearing,  he
discussed the other, earlier debt, and stated that he intended to get it resolved as well,
but he offered no evidence to indicate that any further efforts to do so had been made.
In  August  2018, Applicant  submitted a  Personal Financial  Statement to  indicate
monthly  income,  monthly  expenses,  and  debts.  He  reported  $7,609  in  combined  net
monthly income; and $5,410 in monthly expenses, including $320 in federal taxes. Among
his  debts  are  monthly  payments  of  $430  on  his  Lexus  vehicle.  He  reported  a  monthly
remainder of $419 available for discretionary spending or savings.22
There is no evidence that Applicant has ever received financial counseling. While
there  is  evidence  of  two  recent,  post-hearing  payments  on  both  SOR  and  non-SOR
delinquent  debts,  nearly  a  year  after  the  SOR  was  issued,  and  there  is  evidence  of  a
modest monthly remainder, there is little meaningful evidence to indicate that Applicant’s
financial situation is now under control.

20 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal
Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to
evaluate  an  applicant's  evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to  consider
whether  an  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful  rehabilitation;  (d)  to  decide  whether  a  particular
provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis
under Directive § 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No.
02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also

Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant’s unlisted and unalleged
delinquent accounts will be considered only for the five purposes listed above.
