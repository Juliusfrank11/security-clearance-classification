Applicant,  34,  has  worked  for  her  current  employer,  a  federal  contracting
company,  since  February  2018.  She  was  initially  granted  access  to  classified
information when she served in the U.S. Navy between 2004 and 2008. She completed
her most recent security clearance application in July 2016, while working for a different
employer,  and  disclosed  a  $200  delinquent  debt.  An  April  2016  entry  in  the  Joint
Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) indicated that Applicant resigned from a position
in  September  2015  after  allegations  that  she  falsified  her  timecard  in  June  2015.  The
ensuing  investigation  also  revealed  that  Applicant  owed  that  employer  a  $13,000  debt
for tuition assistance.2
Between  October  2012  and  September  2015,  Applicant  worked  for  a  different
federal  contracting  company.  She  accepted  tuition  assistance  to  pursue  her  graduate
degree  with  the  understanding  that  she  would  be  required  to  repay  any  benefits  she
received  if  she  left  the  company  within  12  months  of  receipt.  In  July  2015,  Applicant
learned that she was the subject of an investigation into allegations that she was doing
schoolwork  during  work  hours.  While  the  investigation  did  not  substantiate  that
allegation,  it  prompted  a  review  of  her  time  cards,  which  showed  that  Applicant  over
charged her time on three days in June 2015. Applicant believes a coworker with whom
she had a bad relationship made the initial allegation of misconduct.3
In  September  2015,  Applicant  resigned  in  lieu  of  termination.  Upon  her
resignation,  Applicant  signed  a  promissory  note,  agreeing  to  repay  $13,000  in  tuition
assistance benefits. Under the terms of the promissory note, she agreed to pay $1,088
from  her  last  paycheck  and  $665.01  for  18  months.  She  claims  that  the  employer  told
her  that  someone  would  contact  her  with  the  details  of  submitting  her  monthly
payments. Because no one from the company reached out to her, she did not make any
payments. However, the promissory note provided payment instructions, including point
of contact information.4
When  she  reported  the  resignation  on  her  July  2016  security  clearance
application, Applicant indicated that she left the job “for a better opportunity.”5 She then
reported  three  months  of  unemployment.  When  asked  about  the disclosure  during  her
August  2017  interview,  Applicant  admitted  that  she  was  concerned  about  how  the
departure would affect her background investigation. She also admitted that she quit the
job before she was fired. At the hearing, Applicant stated that she was not informed that
2 Tr. 13-14; GE 2 - 4.
3 Tr. 15-16, 21-22.
4 Tr. 16-18; GE 1 - 4.
5 GE 1.
she  was  going  to  be  fired,  but  that  she  chose  to  leave  on  her  own  terms  before  the
investigation  was  completed.  She  claims  to  have  contacted  her  former  employer  after
the background interview to honor the promissory note, but she failed to follow through.6
Applicant and her husband have a household income of over $200,000. In 2017,
they purchased a home for $725,000 and a vehicle for $80,000. She testified that she
has the means to repay the education benefits, but has chosen not to do so, prioritizing
other issues in her life.7
