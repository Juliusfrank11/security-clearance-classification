Applicant  is  a  44-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  retain  a  security
clearance. He is employed as a technician who installs and repairs security systems at
overseas locations. He has been so employed  in Afghanistan since July 2016. He has
had multiple overseas job locations with the same employer since he began working for
them  in  mid-2014.  His  formal  education  includes  a  high  school  diploma  and  some
college.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Marine  Corps  during  1995-1999  and
received  an  honorable  discharge.  He  married  recently  in  July  2018,  and  he  has  three
stepchildren from his marriage. (Tr. 69-71) He also has a 12-year-old daughter from a
previous relationship to whom he pays child support and provides health insurance. He
is now a resident of a state that does not impose an income tax.
The  evidence  establishes  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  problems,
which he does not dispute. The SOR concerns the following matters: (1) five delinquent
accounts, charged off or in collection, ranging in amounts from $164 to $5,966 for a total
of about $10,321; (2) failure to timely file income tax returns in the state of Virginia for
tax year 2012 and failure to timely pay income tax for the same year; (3) failure to timely
file income tax returns in the state of Oklahoma for tax years 2012, 2013, and 2014; and
(4)  failure  to  timely  file  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2012  and  2013  and
failure to timely pay income tax for those years. Except for the $912 collection account
he  is  disputing  and  a  $271  medical  collection  account,  Applicant  admitted  the  SOR
allegations in his answer to the SOR or during his hearing testimony or both. Additional
evidence establishing the SOR allegations is found in the documentary evidence.
Applicant attributed his history of financial problems to a difficult relationship with
a  cohabitant  during  2006-2009,  which  ended  in  separation  in  June  2009,  and  the
resulting  dispute  over  visitation  with  and  custody  of  their  daughter.  He  explained  at
length  that  his  cohabitant  was  financially  irresponsible,  failed  to  pay  bills  on  a  timely
basis, and overspent during their relationship. For example, he stated that she wrote 40
bad  checks  in  less  than  a  year  and  failed  to  pay  for  daycare  while  he  was  working  in
Afghanistan.  (Tr.  35-36)  After  the  separation  in  2009,  Applicant  stopped  working
overseas and took a job where he could live near his daughter and be involved with her.
As a result, he earned less money. In 2012, he brought an action in family court, which
was unsuccessful. At that point he decided he could no longer afford to live in a high-
cost  of  living  area  along  with  paying  child  support  and  meet  his  other  financial
obligations.  He moved  to  Oklahoma  in mid-2012 for a  job as  a  junior field  engineer in
the energy industry. He lived about half of 2012 in Virginia and half in Oklahoma, which
is the basis for the requirement to file two state income tax returns for tax year 2012. He
worked in Oklahoma for about two years until June 2014, when he decided to leave the
energy industry and resumed working overseas as a technician, which is more lucrative.
Taken together, the circumstances noted above put Applicant in a financial hole
and  created  some  chaos  in  his  financial  affairs.  He  described  it  as  a  “mess.”  (Tr.  35)
After  departing  Oklahoma  and  returning  to  working  overseas,  he  became  more
financially  stable  and  was  able  to  begin  the  process  of  putting  his  financial  house  in
good order. For example, he filed the past-due federal income tax returns for 2012 and
2013 in mid-2015.
Addressing the five delinquent accounts first, the charged-off account for $5,966
stems  from  a  deficiency  balance  on  an  automobile  loan  obtained  from  a  credit  union.
(Tr.  49-50;  Exhibits  B  and  M)  The  vehicle  was  repossessed  in  August  2013.  The
balance due was adjusted to $4,733, and Applicant made a series of payments during
August and September 2018. The debt was paid in full on September 28, 2018.
The  charged-off  account  for $3,008  stems  from  a  line  of  credit  obtained  from  a
credit union. (Tr. 50-51; Exhibit N). The debt was settled in full as of May 11, 2018.
The $912 collection account stems from an apartment lease Applicant had when
he was living in Oklahoma. (Tr. 51-54; Exhibit L) He explained at length that he did not
break the lease and left the apartment in good order. He challenged the $912 bill when
he  received  it  from  the  landlord,  but  they  refused  to  provide  the  basis  for  the  bill  and
would  not  deal  with  him.  He  hired  an  attorney  in  January  2014  who  formally  disputed
the bill with the landlord. No response was received from the attorney’s demand letter.
The $271 medical collection account is a mystery to Applicant. (Tr. 54-55; Exhibit
4)  He  had  no  information  on  the  account  and  was  unable  to  verify  the  account. While
the  debt  is  reflected  in  an  October  2017  credit  report,  it  was  not  reflected  in  the  most
recent  credit

circumstances, I find that this debt is no longer a concern.
(Tr.  55)  Given

The $164 medical collection account stems from a medical visit or appointment in
Oklahoma. (Tr. 54-55; Exhibit A). The bill, after payment by insurance, was sent to an
address he had since departed. He was able to verify the account and paid it off with a
$170 payment in August 2018.
Turning  to  the  tax  problems,  Applicant  presented  extensive  documentation  to
establish that he is now in compliance with state and federal tax authorities, has filed all
the  required  returns,  and  does  not  owe  back  taxes.  (Exhibits  C-K  and  O-S)  As  noted
above, Applicant filed the past-due federal returns for tax years 2012 and 2013 in mid-
2015.  He  self-prepared  the  returns  with  the  aid  of  TurboTax.  (Exhibit  P)  For  tax  year
2012, the IRS account transcript shows an extension was granted to October 15, 2013;
the  return  was  filed on  June 12, 2015;  penalties for late filing  and  late  payment of  tax
were assessed; a $3,844 credit was transferred in from tax year 2015; and the balance
was  $0  as  of  May  2016.  (Exhibit  C)  Likewise,  for  tax  year  2013,  the  IRS  account
transcript shows the return was filed on July 13, 2015; penalties for late filing and late
payment  of  tax  were  accessed;  a  $1,310  payment  was  made  with  the  return;  and  the
balance was less than $1 and written-off as of September 14, 2015, the effect of which
is a $0 balance. (Exhibit D) In addition to the tax years at issue, IRS transcripts for tax
years 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, show that Applicant timely filed returns and has $0
balances. (Exhibits E, F, G, and H)
More recently in April-May 2018, after the SOR was issued in this case, Applicant
retained  the  services  of  a  CPA  in  Oklahoma  to  review  his  tax  returns.  (Tr.  60)  As  a
result, federal returns for tax years 2012 and 2013  were filed in May 2018. (Exhibit O)
These returns are not reflected in the IRS account transcripts mentioned above, which
were issued on July 30, 2018.
Turning  next  to  the  Oklahoma  tax  matters,  Applicant  filed  returns  for  tax  years
2012, 2013, and 2014 in approximately March 2015, which means the 2014 return was
timely  filed.  (Exhibits  P  and  Q)  He  self-prepared  the  returns  with  the  aid  of  TurboTax.
He filed  as  an  Oklahoma  nonresident/part-year taxpayer for tax  years 2012 and 2014.
He was due refunds of $95 and $53 for tax years 2012 and 2013. He owed a balance of
$9 for tax year 2014. As with the federal returns in April-May 2018, Applicant tasked the
Oklahoma  CPA  to  review  his  Oklahoma  tax  returns.  (Exhibit  O)  Returns  were  filed  in
May 2018 reflecting a $17 refund for tax year 2012, a $53 refund for tax year 2013, and
a  balance  due  of  $1,044 for tax  year 2014.  He  subsequently  contacted  the  Oklahoma
tax authority and was told that he owed $19. (Tr. 61) He paid that amount through the
state’s online system. (Exhibit K)
Turning last to the Virginia tax matters, the 2012 tax return was not filed until May
2018,  as  it  was  also  prepared  by  the  Oklahoma  CPA  in  April-May  2018.  (Exhibit  O)
Applicant conceded that he did not have a good answer why the 2012 return was filed
so late, he lost track of it while addressing other matters, and receipt of the SOR in April
2018 got his attention. The May 2018 Virginia return reflects an amount owed of $3,279.
He  made  a  payment  of  $550  in  July  2018.  (Exhibit  I)  Upon  his  return  to  Afghanistan
after the hearing, he received a notice of assessment from the Virginia tax authority for
a  total amount  owed of  $5,349.  (Exhibits  R and S) Applicant  believed  it  was  mistaken
due to using his combined income from both Virginia and Oklahoma, as he was a part-
year  resident  of  Virginia  in  2012.  He  attempted  to  contact  his  Oklahoma  CPA  several
times. After not receiving a timely response, he retained the services of a Virginia CPA
in  mid-October  2018.  (Exhibit  T)  An  amended  return  for  tax  year  2012  was  filed  on
October 31, 2018, and it reflects a small refund and no further tax owed. (Exhibit U)
Overall, Applicant’s current financial situation appears to be stable. He earns an
annual  gross  income  of  about  $140,000.  (Tr.  58)  He  pays  $744  monthly  for  child
support  and  about  $235  in  health  insurance  for  his  minor  daughter,  and  he  is  current
with his payments. (Tr. 58-59) He has a 401(k) account with his current employer with a
balance of about $17,185. (Tr. 81) He has a brokerage account with a balance of about
$15,000.  (Tr.  82)  He  has  a  savings  account  with  a  balance  of  about  $11,000,  and  he
has  a  checking  account  with  a  balance  of  about  $1,100.  (Tr.  83)  He  traveled  from
Afghanistan at his own expense for the hearing in this case.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for

Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;
AG ¶ 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local
income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income
tax as required;
AG  ¶  20(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  a  death,  divorce,  or
separation,  clear  victimization  by  predatory  lending  practices,  or  identity
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and
6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶¶ E3.1.14 and E3.1.15.
AG ¶ 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax
authority  to  file  or  pay  the  amount  owed  and  is  in  compliance  with  those
arrangements.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.  The
disqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.
Applicant’s problematic financial history is traceable to a difficult relationship with
a cohabitant during 2006-2009, when they separated that year in June. The separation
was largely due to the cohabitant’s financial irresponsibility, failure to pay bills on time,
and overspending. They fought over visitation with and custody of his daughter, and he
changed jobs and worked for less money so he could be near his daughter during 2009-
2012.  He  attempted  a  career  change  to  the  energy  industry  during  2012-2014  until
deciding to return his previous employment working overseas for more money. Many of
those  circumstances  were  largely  beyond  his  control.  Moreover,  his  motive  in  making
those changes was, he believed, in the best interests of his daughter.
Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances. He resolved nearly all
of the delinquent debt at issue, and he is disputing a collection account stemming from
an apartment lease. He also fixed his tax problems and is in compliance with both state
and federal tax authorities, although he could have acted more promptly, especially with
the state of Virginia. He is now in a much stronger financial position, meaning that it is
unlikely that a similar problem  will recur. By  way of example, I note that he has timely
filed federal income tax returns since 2014.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent  standard,  I  have  no  doubts  about
Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or
sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence  as  a  whole
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or  vice
versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he met his ultimate
burden  of  persuasion  to  show  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to
grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:
For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a -- 1.g:
For Applicant
Conclusion
It  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for
access to classified information. Eligibility granted.
