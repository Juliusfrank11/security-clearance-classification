In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  factual  allegations
pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.o.), as well as
the sole allegation pertaining to personal conduct (SOR  ¶ 2.a). Applicant’s admissions
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the
evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due  consideration  of  same,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a financial technician (travel auditor) with his current employer since April 2019, after
serving in a different position as a clerk with the same employer since July 2016. A 1983
high  school  graduate,  Applicant  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1990,  and  earned  a
number of additional  credits  towards a  higher degree.  He  served  on  active  duty  as an
infantry officer with the U.S. Marine Corps  (USMC) from August 1992 until June 1998,
when he accepted a regular commission, and continued serving with the USMC until he
resigned his commission and received an honorable discharge as a major in June 2000.
He was granted a secret clearance in 1994, and has been occupying a position of public
trust since 2016. Applicant was married in 2000, and he has been separated since 2010,
with an intention of divorcing, once he has the money to do so. He has one child, born in
2004.
Military Record
During  his  military  career,  Applicant  was  deployed  overseas  to  Kuwait,  Korea,
Japan,  and  Somalia,  and  while  in  the  United  States,  was  involved  in  counterdrug
operations.  He  was  awarded  the  National  Defense  Service  Medal,  a  Certificate  of
Appreciation,  the  Sea  Service  Deployment  Ribbon,  the  Armed  Forces  Expeditionary
Medal, the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, the Combat Action Ribbon, the Meritorious Unit
Commendation, and the Marine Corps Recruiting Ribbon.1
Financial Considerations2
As  noted  above,  after  the  hearing  was  conducted,  Applicant  accepted  another
position from his employer, with an immediate increase of his annual salary, as well as
overtime.3  However, before his  recent  string of favorable  employment  experiences, he
went through a series of unemployment periods commencing in August 2008, during the
national housing crisis and plummeting national economy. He had previously been hired
as a pharmaceutical sales specialist in April 2004, and when his mentor left the company
for a competitor, Applicant joined his mentor in May 2007. Because he was unable to sell
his  residence  in  one  city,  he  could  not  afford  to  maintain  two  mortgages.  His  new
employer  had  a  policy  that  mandated  that  he  reside  fulltime  within  his  designated
geographical  territory  within  six  months  of  being  hired.  Recognizing  the  difficulties,
Applicant’s district manager extended him an extra 12 months to move. However, senior
management refused to permit an additional extension, and Applicant was terminated in
August 2008.4
Although  he  sought  employment  in  his  field  in  entry-level  positions  in  multiple
locations, he was unsuccessful because he was deemed overqualified and because he
had previously made too much salary. Applicant was eventually able to gain a variety of
full-time and part-time seasonal positions starting in February 2010, but he went through
additional  layoffs  and  unemployment  from  August  2010  until  October  2013;  July  2014
until January 2015; and July 2015 until March 2016.5
Applicant’s  savings  were  eventually  depleted,  and  some  accounts  became
delinquent.  At  least  one  account  was  charged  off.  The  SOR  identified  15  purportedly
delinquent  accounts  that  had  been  placed  for  collection  or  charged  off,  as  generally
reflected  by  Applicant’s  June  2016  or  October  2017  credit  reports.  Those  debts  total
approximately $45,544. The current status of those accounts is as follows:
1 AE H (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD Form 214), dated June 3, 1998);
AE I (DD Form 214, dated June 15, 2000); AE J (List of Deployments, undated); AE L (Award List, undated).

(SOR ¶ 1.a.): This is a home mortgage with a high credit of $180,000 and a past-
due balance of $5,164, which was placed for collection after Applicant’s June 2016 credit
report was issued.6 The account was actually current until  mid-2016, when Applicant’s
wife was involved in an automobile accident. It occurred during a transition period when
Applicant was between employers and health coverages, leaving him fully responsible for
the unanticipated approximately $6,000 in medical payments and vehicle repair costs. He
eventually  managed  to  substantially  reduce  the  delinquency,  but  a  natural  disaster  –
called Hurricane Michael – occurred in October 2018, leaving him further behind. That
hurricane was the first category 5 hurricane to strike the contiguous United States since
1992. Applicant had previously been granted annual leave, and, as an hourly employee
rather than a salaried employee, he was required to take the leave although the facility
had shut down. Because of his reduced income caused by the shutdown, Applicant did
not have sufficient funds to make his monthly mortgage payment. He managed to make
multiple monthly payments in early 2019 in an effort to catch up, and as of April 3, 2019,
he  was  only  two  months  behind.  His  parents  became  aware  of  his  situation,  and  they
were scheduled to make his April payment, an action that would bring his mortgage  to
only one month delinquent, and Applicant planned to make his May payment on the due
date to bring it back into a current status.7 The account has either been resolved or is the
process of being resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): This is a bank-issued credit-card account with a $16,659 credit limit
that was placed for collection and a disputed amount was reported to have been charged
off in June 2012. Applicant’s June 2016 credit report stated that $16,659 was charged off,
but his October 2017 credit report seems to indicate that there was a past due balance
of $10,320 and an unpaid balance of $14,609.8 In 2014, approximately three years before
the SOR was issued, Applicant entered into a repayment arrangement with the creditor’s
collection agent under which he agreed to make monthly $50 payments commencing on
January  31,  2014.  He  continued  to  make  his  payments  in  compliance  with  those
arrangements through October 2018, when the creditor withdrew the account from the
collection agent, eventually reducing the unpaid balance from $16,659.91 to $13,909.91.9
Applicant contends that the creditor informed him in May 2019, that it anticipates issuing
him a Form 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt, in the amount of $13,901.91,10 but he failed to
submit any documents to support his contention. Notwithstanding the absence of such
supporting documentation, it appears that the account is in the process of being resolved.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.c. through 1.e.): These are three bank-issued credit-card accounts from
the  same  bank  with  reported  unpaid  and  past-due  balances  of  $12,165,  $6,986,  and

$3,127  that  were  placed  for  collection.11  Applicant  was  not  aware  that  his  wife  had
stopped making the monthly payments on the accounts because she was handling the
bills  and  never  told  him  about  the  delinquencies.  When  he  found  out  about  the
delinquencies and questioned her, she denied knowing that they were in collection.12 The
creditor issued Applicant three Form 1099-Cs, cancelling the three debts: on May 3, 2014,
cancelling the debt for $5,404.40  (SOR ¶ 1.d.); on November 15, 2014, cancelling the
debt for $10,900.63  (SOR  ¶  1.c.); and  on  December 31,  2015,  cancelling  the  debt for
$3,054.02  (SOR  ¶  1.e.).13  While  the  two  older  Form  1099-Cs  were  to  be  applied  to
Applicant’s 2014 income, and the most recent one was to be applied to his 2015 income,
Applicant seemingly amended his earlier filings and added all three to his federal income
tax return for the tax year 2014, which he filed in March 2018.14 Because his withheld
income  tax,  earned  income  credit,  and  child  tax  credit  were  more  than  his  total  tax,
including the income from the cancelled debts, Applicant anticipated a tax refund.15 Those
accounts have been resolved.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.j., 1.k., 1.l., 1.n., and 1.o.): These are eight medical debts,
totaling  $3,063,  purportedly  generated  in  2013  by  unidentified  medical  providers  with
unpaid balances of $1,211, $588, $420, $389, $274, $130, $31, and $31 that were placed
for  collection,  as  reported  solely  by  Equifax  (with  one  exception  regarding  an  account
reported  also  by  TransUnion)  in  Applicant’s  June  2016  credit  report.16  None  of  these
debts  are  reported  in  Applicant’s  October  2017  Equifax  credit  report.  Although  he
“verified”  the  information  pertaining  to  the  accounts  during  his  interview  with  an
investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in July 2017, in fact,
he  was  under  the  impression  those  debts  were  related  to  his  May  2016  accident  and
resulting  injuries  while  at  work.  Moreover,  when  asked  about  each  particular  account,
Applicant had no specific information to discuss because the charges should have been
handled by his workers compensation claim.17 Applicant contacted both the hospital and
the billing department of the medical group that he thought had generated the bills, but
they had no record of any outstanding accounts in his name. He contacted Equifax, but
it too had no such information.18
During the hearing, because he was unable to obtain any information regarding
the  accounts,  he  stated  that  they  might  be  related  to  his  wife’s  June  2016  accident.19

Applicant’s wife managed to locate two explanations of benefits (one for herself and one
for their son) which indicated that the charges related to a June 9, 2016 incident were, for
some unexplained reason, sent directly to Medicaid rather than to the primary insurance
company. Neither bill was in an amount listed in the credit report or in the SOR.20 The
Appeal Board previously explained:21
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for
the debt or that matters in mitigation apply.
In attempting to meet his burden, Applicant contacted the credit reporting agency,
the hospital, the billing department of his medical group, and the only identified collection
agent. His wife contacted the insurance companies and potential medical providers. No
relevant information pertaining to 2013 medical charges was furnished to them. Since the
identities of the unidentified  creditors have  not been  reported  to Applicant,  despite  his
being motivated and able to resolve these purported debts, it is impossible for him to take
further  action. While  it  is  not  dispositive  of  the  allegations,  it  is  significant  that  neither
Experian nor TransUnion (with the one exception) reported the accounts in Applicant’s
June 2016 credit report, and Equifax, after reporting them in that credit report, did not
report the accounts in the October 2017 credit report.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.i. and 1.m.): These are two medical debts, totaling $519, purportedly
generated in 2014 by unidentified medical providers with unpaid balances of $389 and
$130 that were placed for collection, with one reported by Equifax and TransUnion, and
one reported solely by Equifax in Applicant’s June 2016 credit report.22 Applicant and his
wife  took  the  actions  described  above  regarding  the  2013  medical  accounts,  with  the
same results.
Other  than  the  accounts  alleged  in  the  SOR,  there  is  no  evidence  of  any  other
delinquent  accounts.  During  the  hearing,  Applicant  indicated  that  in  the  past,  he  had
earned six-figure salaries and bonuses, and that became a major issue in his inability to
obtain  employment  over  the  ensuing  years.23  During  the  tax  year  2018,  Applicant’s
income  was  $32,236.49.24  As  noted  above,  on  April  24,  2019,  Applicant  received  an
official job offer for a civil-service positions with a salary, including locality pay, of $37,843,

a  position  he  accepted.25  While  there  is  no  evidence  of  financial  counseling,  in  the
absence  of  any  additional  delinquent  accounts,  it  appears  that  Applicant’s  financial
situation is now under control.
Personal Conduct
On June 9, 2016, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he responded to certain
questions pertaining to his financial record found in Section 26. Some of those questions
asked if, in the past seven years, he had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency;
and had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay
as agreed. Applicant answered “no” to those questions, and certified that his responses
were “true, complete, and correct” to the best of his knowledge and belief.26 In fact, his
answers  were  incorrect,  for  Applicant  actually  had  several  delinquent  accounts  that
clearly came within the scope of the questions asked.
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he had deliberately falsified the
material  facts  in  his  responses  to  the  e-QIP  inquiries,  although  during  the  hearing  he
modified that admission by claiming that he did not purposely try to deceive, and did not
know why he had answered as he had.27 He claimed that he had used his 2010 e-QIP for
most of his entries, and noted that in that 2010 e-QIP, he answered the same questions
with a “yes.” He reiterated that it was not his intention to deceive.28
Work Performance and Character References
Several  individuals  have  known  Applicant  for  over  30  years.  One  former  senior
non-commissioned officer – a member of a special forces group, and now with the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security – has had years of interaction with Applicant when he
was an infantry officer and a recruiter. He is aware that Applicant holds on to the traditions
and codes of conduct. He does not believe that Applicant is capable of trying to deceive
the U.S. Government about his financial status.  He knows Applicant is very serious about
security issues, and based on 30 years of interaction, he is confident that Applicant’s error
was unintentional and would not be repeated. He is also aware that Applicant is dealing
with an estranged wife, and based on his experience in dealing with such situations, it is
quite common for the estranged spouse not to share certain financial issues.29
A retired U.S. Navy lieutenant commander has also known Applicant for 30 years.
Without reservation, he does not believe that Applicant would ever purposely attempt to

public trust, but rather a position that requires a secret clearance.

deceive investigators. His comments echoed those of the first character reference.30 A
retired  USMC  master  sergeant  has  known  Applicant  for  four  decades.  Knowing
Applicant’s character and excellent personal ethics, any question regarding misleading or
actively deceiving the Government “simply is not within his core.”31 Another individual who
has known Applicant for over 30 years is equally supportive. She stated that Applicant
“has more integrity than any person I have known. His strength of character is evident as
he will not compromise his morals for any reason. I have never known this man to tell a
lie  or  deceive  in  word  or  action.”  She  added,  that  he  possesses  all  of  the  following
attributes: honesty, integrity, strong core values, and the strength to stand by them.32
The director of the Navy’s largest personnel support detachment has had Applicant
on his staff for three years. Applicant is considered very proficient and knowledgeable,
with a proactive approach in all tasks assigned. He is considered loyal, trustworthy, and
dedicated to mission success. He is also versatile, self-motivated, and very reliable.33
Applicant has received several performance awards, including one for initiative.34
Applicant’s  military  performance  reports  reflect  an  individual  with  outstanding  future
potential who is detailed, mature, motivated, and efficient, who always maintains a crisp
military  appearance,  has  outstanding  organizational  skills,  has  an  imaginative  and
proactive approach to problem-solving skills, and who is an honest broker.35
