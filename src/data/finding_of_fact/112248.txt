Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He is 57 years old. He married in
1993 and divorced in 2008. He has an adult daughter, and both she and his grandson
live with him.1
Applicant obtained a high school equivalency diploma in approximately 1980. He
has attended college since 2010 but had not yet earned a degree. He honorably served
in  the  U.S.  military  from  1982  to  1986.  He  has  worked  as  a  graphic  artist  for  a  DOD
contractor since December 2016. He has never held a security clearance.2
Applicant  attributed  his  delinquent  debts  to  the  2008  economic  downturn;  his
divorce; his job loss in 2010 and subsequent periods of unemployment or employment
with  limited  income;  and  his  diabetes-related  expenses  when  he  did  not  have  health
insurance. Applicant testified that through his divorce, he was held primarily responsible
for  the  debts  incurred  during  his  marriage.  After  he  lost  his  job  of  five  years  as  a
multimedia director at an architectural firm in May 2010, he went from an annual salary
of  $85,000  to  being  unemployed  until  June  2011.  During  this  and  his  subsequent  two
periods  of  unemployment,  he  attended  school  through  a  program  available  to  military
veterans, and supported himself, in part, through student loans.3
Applicant  worked  as  a  truck  driver  from  October  2011  to  December  2012,  until
his diabetes affected his ability to work and he became unemployed for a second time
until  June  2013.  He  incurred  medical  expenses  for  his  diabetes  because  he  did  not
have health insurance. In 2011, though he worked as a janitor and did part-time work in
computer  animation  through  his  service-disabled  veteran-owned  small  business,  he
could  not  afford  the  mortgage  on  his  $340,000  home  that  he  purchased  in  around
February  2009.  He  moved  out  and  found  tenants  for  his  home,  but  fell  behind  on  his
mortgage  when  two  separate  tenants  failed  to  pay  rent  and  the  homeowners’
association  (HOA)  fees  from  2011  through  2014.  During  this  period,  he  lived  with  his
brother; he rented an inexpensive apartment at $700 monthly; and he lived with his best

friend for seven months. He was unemployed for a third time, from June to December
2016.4
The  SOR  alleges  two  judgments  from  2014  and  2015  totaling  $2,407  (SOR  ¶¶
1.a-1.b) and six delinquent consumer accounts totaling $36,847 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.h). The
debts are established by a 2017 credit bureau report and court records. Applicant also
disclosed and discussed his debts in his 2017 security clearance application (SCA) and
2017 background interview.5
The two judgments in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b for $2,407 from 2014 and 2015 stem
from  Applicant’s  tenants’  failure  to  pay  rent  and  HOA  fees  for  his  home.  Applicant
testified  that  he  used  money  from  his  401k  retirement  account  to  resolve  both
judgments. The judgments were paid in December 2017.6
SOR ¶ 1.c is for a credit card charged off for $3,050. Applicant testified that this
was a joint credit card with his then wife, which he used to pay his mortgage. Applicant
provided  documentation  reflecting  that  he  settled  this  debt  for  $1,835  and  paid  it  in
October 2018.7
SOR ¶ 1.d is for a credit card charged off for $7,708. Applicant was the primary
account  holder  but  he  permitted  his  then  wife  to  be  an  authorized  user.  Applicant
testified  that  she  continued  to  use  the  card  after  the  divorce,  but  the  card  was  later
destroyed. Applicant testified that he disputed this debt through the credit repair service
Lexington  Law,  and  the  debt  was  consequently  removed  from  his  credit.  He  also
indicated that he attempted to contact the creditor to settle the debt, but was told that he
could  not  do  so  because  the  debt  was  forgiven.  He  indicated  that  he  had  not  yet
received an IRS Form 1099-C from the creditor, despite his attempts to obtain one.8
SOR ¶ 1.e is for a $294 charged-off account for a printer, which later turned out
to not work. Applicant provided documentation to show that he paid this debt.9
SOR  ¶  1.f  is  for  a  $24,927  charged-off  debt-consolidation  loan.  Applicant
obtained the loan in 2009 to resolve debts from his marriage that were lingering after his
divorce.  He  indicated  that  after  he  lost  his  job,  he  used  money  from  his  401(k)
retirement account to pay down the balance of this debt to $13,504, with the intention of
continuing to pay it once he found a job. He exhausted the money from his retirement
account  and  was  unable  to  find  another  job,  so  the  balance  climbed  to  $24,927.    He

testified that he was advised by Lexington Law to obtain another debt-consolidation loan
to  resolve  it.  However,  he  provided  documentation  to  show  that  he  instead  settled  the
debt in October 2018 for $13,804, for which he would pay at $100 monthly until it was
paid in full.10
SOR  ¶  1.g  is  for  a  $676  apartment  fee  placed  in  collection.  Applicant  was
charged a fee by his apartment for his daughter living with him. Applicant indicated that
he  paid  this  debt  in  June  2017.  He  provided  documentation  reflecting  that  this  debt  is
paid.11
SOR  ¶  1.h  is  for  a  telecommunication  account  charged  off  for  $192.  Applicant
indicated  that  he  paid  this  debt  in  June  2017.  He  testified  that  he  requested  that  the
creditor send him documentation reflecting his payment, but the creditor did not comply.
He provided documentation from the creditor reflecting that the debt was being removed
from his credit reports.12
Applicant  brought  his  mortgage  current  by  utilizing  a  program  available  through
his  mortgage  holder  that  permitted  him  to  make  partial  mortgage  payments,  while
tacking the remainder onto the balance of the loan. He exhausted the money from his
401k retirement account, obtained a student loan, and supplemented with money from
his  janitorial  and  computer  animation  work  to  make  his  mortgage  payments.  He
indicated that he has not had problems paying his mortgage since obtaining his current
job. He testified that he is current on his monthly mortgage payments of $2,167, and he
has been current on his two monthly HOA fees totaling $240 since November 2017.13
Applicant  testified  that  he  has  worked  diligently  to  improve  his  credit  score  by
tackling  his  debts  one  at  a  time.  He  testified  that  he  prioritized  bringing  a  delinquent
student loan current, which he did in June 2018, and paying other bills not alleged in the
SOR.  He  testified  that  he  has  received  telephonic  financial  counseling  from  Lexington
Law  once  every  two  months  since  June  2017,  and  he  pays  them  $68  monthly.  He
testified  that  he  took  their  advice  to  continue  rebuilding  his  credit  by  timely  paying  his
bills, so that he could obtain a debt-consolidation loan to resolve any remaining debts at
once;  he  had  not  obtained  such  a  loan  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing.  Meanwhile,  he
testified  that  Lexington  Law  was  negotiating  with  his  creditors  for  forgiveness  of  any
interest  and  penalties  on  his  outstanding  accounts.  He  provided  a  copy  of  his  budget,
reflecting  a  monthly  income  of  $4,876  and  a  monthly  net  remainder  after  expenses  of
$785. He testified that he has not had a credit card for eight to ten years, and his sole
line of credit was for his car. He testified that he commutes 106 miles daily to get to and
from work.14

Applicant’s brother testified that Applicant lived with him after losing his job. The
brother testified that he was aware that Applicant had just purchased his “dream home,”
and  encouraged  Applicant  to  find  tenants  to  live  in  it.  He  corroborated  Applicant’s
testimony that Applicant worked as a truck driver, then as a janitor, to make ends meet.
The brother testified that one set of tenants sued Applicant when he attempted to move
back into his home. When they lost, they vandalized the home, which Applicant had to
spend money to repair. The brother testified that Applicant’s strength of character pulled
him through his difficult times.15
Applicant’s best friend of 25 years testified that Applicant also lived with him for
around seven months in 2014, when Applicant faced difficult times and could not afford
to  pay  the  mortgage  on  his  home.  He  testified  that  he  never  witnessed  Applicant  live
beyond  his  means.  He  testified  that  he  found  it  commendable,  and  a  reflection  of
Applicant’s  dedication,  perseverance,  and  commitment,  that  Applicant  ultimately  held
onto  his  home  without  having  to  file  bankruptcy.  As  a  clearance  holder,  the  witness
vouched for Applicant’s trustworthiness.16
