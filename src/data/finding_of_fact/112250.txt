Applicant  is  a  45-year-old  senior  electrical  engineer,  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since 2003. She earned a bachelor’s degree in 1999 and a master’s degree in
2006. She married in 1995 and divorced in 2011. She remarried in 2012. She has four

The SOR alleges 16 delinquent debts totaling over $31,000, a deed relinquished
in  lieu  of  foreclosure,  and  a  2006  bankruptcy  discharge.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.r.)  SOR  ¶  1.s
alleges Applicant’s failure to file Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013
to 2017. The record evidence is sufficient to establish the SOR allegations.
In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations, but for SOR
¶  1.h,  a timeshare deed  in  lieu  of foreclosure  allegation,  stating  that  it  was  part of  her
divorce and was settled and paid. Applicant provided post-hearing evidence of resolution
of this allegation. Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 1.s during testimony.
While married to her first spouse, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in 2005,
which resulted in the discharge of nearly $80,000 in debts in 2006. Applicant accumulated
debts from a business venture from 2001 to 2005, and defaulted on other debts and credit
cards.  The  largest  SOR  debt  is  an  $18,734  new  car  loan  from  2011  that  became
delinquent in 2012 after Applicant had an accident and stopped paying. (SOR ¶ 1.a) Since
she was uninsured and could not afford the repairs, she abandoned the car with the auto
dealer. This debt remains unresolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.i are duplicate debts for $2,876, for damage to a rental property.
Applicant paid the collection company (SOR ¶ 1.i) in May 2018, and provided evidence
in her post-hearing submission. These allegations are resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c is a collection account for a credit card that is past due in the amount
of $896. Applicant testified that it was unpaid, and that she had not contacted the creditor
or collection agent. In her post-hearing submission, she stated that intends to dispute the
amount owed with the assistance of a second credit repair company. This debt remains
unresolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.d - 1.f,2 1.l - 1.n, and 1.p - 1.q, are medical debts. Applicant testified that
none of the debts were resolved. However, in her post-hearing submission, she provided
evidence  of  payments  or  partial  payments  toward  the  medical  debts.  They  are  now
resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.g is a 2009 judgment for $3,184 from an appliance and furniture company
that has not been paid. Applicant testified that she has not resolved the debt. In her post-
hearing submission, Applicant stated that she was advised by a credit repair attorney that
although the judgment is current, she should not make efforts to pay it so that it does not
reappear on her credit report. However, the debt stays in the public record for 20 years.
This debt is unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.j is a cable company debt for $600 on an item that was returned but not
accounted for by the company. The debt also appears as SOR ¶ 1.o. Applicant disputed
the  debt  and  was  issued  a  lost  equipment  ticket.  She  stated  that  after  30  days,  the
equipment will be considered permanently lost and the charge will be removed. SOR ¶
1.k is a credit card account for $290 placed for collection. In her post-hearing submission,
Applicant stated the account has been paid in full. These debts are resolved.
During testimony, Applicant stated that after her divorce in 2011, she believed that
she filed her 2012 Federal income tax return, and sent in a check for $13,000 in taxes.
The IRS notified her that they could not match the check with a tax return. Applicant stated
that she mailed in a copy of the return, but continued to receive letters from the IRS. This
incident caused her to lose confidence in her ability to file tax returns, so Federal returns
after 2012 were not filed. Regarding state returns, Applicant claimed that she filed her
2013 tax return in another state, but has not filed any other state returns. She testified
that  she  hired  an  accountant  to  file  all  tax  returns  owed,  however  she  did  not  provide
evidence of additional tax return filings or the current status of her efforts to resolve SOR
¶  1.s  in  her  post-hearing  submission.  SOR  ¶  1.s  remains  unresolved.  In  testimony,
Applicant also admitted that she did not report her failure to file tax returns on her 2016
SCA.
Applicant’s gross income is $178,000. She testified that she had $2,500 in bank
accounts and about $90,000 in a 401K retirement account. She borrowed about $30,000
from  the  401K,  and  owes  $9,000.  Her  spouse  restarted  a  bath  and  beauty  product
business at home, and earned about $8,000 in 2017 and $20,000 in 2018. Their business
inventory is worth $15,000 - $18,000. Applicant testified that she needed to learn to be
responsible  and  manage  her  debts,  and  had  never  had  formal  credit  counseling.  She
acknowledged in her post-hearing submission that her hearing was a “wake up call,” and
that she was ashamed that she allowed her financial neglect to impact her clearance. She

noted  that  she  needed  to  do  better  and  needed  help  to  be  successful.  She  attended
employee  sponsored  debt  counseling,  created  a  budget,  cut  expenses,  and  started  to
save for an emergency. She also contacted a debt resolution attorney to assist her with
her debts.
