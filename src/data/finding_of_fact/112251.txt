Applicant  is 59  years old.  She  was  married  to  her first husband from 1983 until
they  divorced  in  1993.  She  was  married  to  her  second  husband  from  1993  until  they
divorced  in  2016.  She  has  three  adult  children  from  her  first  marriage  and  one  adult
daughter from her second marriage. Applicant attended some college and has worked as
an accounting clerk for her current employer since February 2017. This is her first security
clearance application.
Applicant’s financial problems began during her second marriage. Her ex-husband
was abusive and he gambled. They separated in 2012, and their divorce was finalized in
2016. The financial stresses of raising her children and helping her mother contributed to
her financial difficulties. Additionally, Applicant was unemployed for approximately three
weeks in 2015, and from April 2009 until March 2010. (Item 1; Item 3 at 9-10, 14)
The  SOR  alleged  five  delinquent  debts,  totaling  almost  $26,000  and  a  2017
Chapter  13  bankruptcy  filing.  In  Applicant’s  Answer,  she  claimed  she  was  making
payments  toward  two  debts,  was  in  negotiations  for  two  debts,  and  claimed  one  debt
belonged to her ex-husband. Additionally, she claimed she was making payments toward
the Chapter 13 bankruptcy. At some point, she obtained a part-time job to help her repay
her delinquent debts. (Item 1)

payments, or how many payments she had made. (Item 1; Item 6 at 22)
SOR  ¶  1.b.  In  2014,  Applicant  purchased  a  home  directly  from  the  owner  for
$89,000.  She  fell  behind  on  her  $810  monthly  payments,  and  in  approximately  March
2017, she stopped making all payments per the recommendation of an attorney. Applicant
was advised to stop making payments to force a strategic foreclosure and a subsequent
loan modification. She is currently delinquent in the amount of $14,618. In her Answer,

payments,  nor  did  she  indicate  when  she  started  making  payments,  or  how  many
