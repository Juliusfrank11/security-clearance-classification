Applicant is a 45-year-old single woman with two children. She has been married
previously,  from  2000  to  2014.  The  marriage  ended  in  divorce.  (Tr. 74) She  earned  a
bachelor’s  degree  in  1995.  Applicant  is  an  information  technology  professional  who
oversees the processing of military health data. (AE J at 5) She has been employed in this
line of work since 1995. (Tr. 42)
Applicant is highly respected on the job. Her supervisor characterized her work as
stellar.  (Tr.  17)  Per  a  team  member  from  another  company,  Applicant  has  in-depth
knowledge of data processing and is a critical member of the team. (AE J at 4)
Applicant failed to file her federal and state income tax returns timely for tax years
2009 to 2013. (Answer at 1) She attributes her failure to file income tax returns to her
troubled  marriage,  which  by  2009  had  begun  to  deteriorate.  Specifically,  her  husband
whose $140,000 salary exceeded hers by $40,000, “wasn’t pulling his weight” with the filing
of tax returns and the corresponding tax bills, leaving her solely responsible for their filing
and payment each year. (Tr. 50) By 2009, she “had had it.” (Tr. 50) Consequently, she told
him that she was no longer going to file the tax returns and pay the tax debts, and that he
had to do it. (Tr. 51)
Applicant’s husband did not file the federal and state tax returns either for 2009 or
2010. (Tr. 53) Periodically, Applicant would ask him if he had filed them, and he would
reassure her that he was working on them. (Tr. 81-83) Unbeknownst to Applicant, her
husband filed his income tax returns individually. Ultimately, she did not discover that he
was not filing the income tax returns jointly until 2011, when he moved from the family
home. (Tr. 83)
After  Applicant’s  husband  left  her,  her  financial  problems  snowballed.  (Tr.  53)
Despite  earning  a  higher  salary,  he  paid  less  than  half  of  the  children’s  expenses.
Moreover,  although  they  shared  joint  custody,  the  children  stayed  with  Applicant
approximately 75 percent of the time. (Tr. 80)
Applicant remained hopeful that she and her husband would reconcile and that he
would  help  her  with  her  financial  problems.  Although  they  made  some  attempts  at
reconciliation, he never moved back into the home. In 2015, he told her that he was in love
with someone else, was filing for divorce, and getting remarried. (Tr. 44) Preoccupied and
emotionally devastated by her failing marriage,1 Applicant had failed to file her state and
federal income tax returns for 2011 to 2013, in addition to 2009 and 2010, by the time her
divorce was finalized. (Tr. 57)
As part of the divorce settlement, Applicant’s ex-husband was supposed to pay part
of the tax delinquency. (Tr. 55) He did not do so. After the divorce was finalized, Applicant
retained an attorney to help her file her delinquent income tax returns. (GE 7) By this time,
the federal government had entered a lien against her property for  $214,039 in federal
income taxes, and she owed approximately $15,000 in delinquent state income taxes for
tax years 2009 through 2014. (GE 7 at 1; Item 2 at 3-4; Answer at 1) With the help of her
attorney, she filed her state income tax returns, and negotiated a payment plan with the
state tax authority. (Item 2 at 4) Beginning in September 2015, she began making $950
monthly payments consistent with the plan. By September 2017, she had satisfied her
state income tax delinquency. (GE 3 at 20)
Applicant’s attorney attempted to negotiate an offer-in-compromise (OIC) with the
Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS).  Through  her  attorney,  Applicant  proposed  to  make
monthly payments for the part of the delinquency from 2009 through 2013 that remained
legally collectible, totaling 24 months. (GE 7 at 2) OIC negotiations lasted approximately a
year between 2016 and 2017. While negotiations were pending, Applicant paid $675 per
month towards the delinquency. (Tr. 120)
The IRS rejected the proposed OIC. (GE 7 at 2) Applicant’s attorney then referred
her  to  a  bankruptcy  attorney.  On  August  14,  2017,  Applicant  filed  for  Chapter  13
bankruptcy protection (AE D at 1) The case was later converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
Under the plan, she sought a discharge of her tax debts from 2009 to 2014. On September
12, 2018, the court discharged all of the debt for tax years 2009 through 2013. (AE B, AE
C) It denied her request to discharge the 2014 bankruptcy, reasoning that it remained a
priority debt because of its recency. (AE D at 1)
Applicant then contacted the IRS and entered into an installment agreement to pay
the  remaining  2014  income  tax  balance,  totaling  $26,868.  (AE  D  at  1;  AE  E)  Monthly
payments of $430 were scheduled to begin in November 2018. (AE N) The lien remains
outstanding.
1  Applicant’s  emotional  distress  from  the  marital  separation  was  so  acute  that  it  prompted  her  doctor  to
prescribe her anti-depressants. (Tr. 122)
Applicant has been filing her taxes timely since 2015. Her federal tax payments from
2015  through  2017  are  all  up-to-date  and  no  balance  is  owed.  (AE  M)  She  has  been
making payments on her 2018 tax returns on a quarterly basis. Payments are current. (Tr.
57)
Applicant currently earns between $100,000 and $110,000. She maintains a budget
and has between $200 and $300 of monthly discretionary income. (Tr. 117) She credits the
financial  management  course  she  took  as  part  of  the  bankruptcy  proceedings  with
improving her financial management skills. (Tr. 114)
