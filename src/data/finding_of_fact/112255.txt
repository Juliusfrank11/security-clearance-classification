Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  2015.  He  seeks  to  obtain  a  security  clearance.  He  has  a
master’s degree, which was awarded in 2013. He is married with three children.1
Applicant was born in Iraq to Iraqi parents. He attended college in Iraq. He then
performed  his  mandatory  service  in  the  Iraqi  military  for  two  years.  He  worked  under
dangerous  conditions  as  a  linguist  with  the  U.S.  military  in  Iraq  from  2005  to  2007.
Because  of  his  work  with  the  military,  he  was  eligible  for  a  special  immigrant  visa.
Applicant and his immediate family immigrated to the United States in 2007. He became
a U.S. citizen in 2013, while maintaining his Iraqi citizenship. His wife and three children
also became U.S. citizens.2
Applicant’s father is deceased. His mother, four siblings, and parents-in-law are
citizens  and  residents  of  Iraq.  His  mother  has  never  worked  outside  the  home.  His
brother  is  a  music  teacher.  His  three  sisters  are  married  and  do  not  work  outside  the
home.  Their  husbands  have  no  direct  connection  to  the  Iraqi  government.  Applicant’s
father-in-law retired from the Iraqi military. He receives a pension for his service, but he
has no other ongoing connection to the Iraqi military or the Iraqi government.3
Applicant’s grandfather passed away in 2007 or earlier. Before he immigrated to
the United States, Applicant bought the family home in Iraq for the equivalent of about
$15,000. His mother was living in the house at the time. He bought the house so that his
brother  could  live  in  the  house  and  take  care  of  his  elderly  mother.  Applicant  has  no
intention to ever return to live in the house. He estimated the current value of the house
to be between about $40,000 and $45,000. He also owns a house in the United States
that he purchased in 2009.4
Applicant regularly contacts his mother by telephone. He will speak to his brother
and  sisters  when  he  calls  his  mother.  His  wife  regularly  contacts  her  parents  by
telephone.  Applicant  will  usually  get  on  the  phone  to  say  hello.  He  sends  his  mother
about $200 to $300 per month to help with her living expenses.5

Applicant voted in an Iraqi election while in the United States in 2014. He wanted
to  promote  democracy  in  Iraq.  He  returned  to  Iraq  to  work  for  defense  contractors  in
2009, 2010 to 2011, and periodically since  2015. He does not visit his family while he
works in Iraq. He periodically visits his mother and other family members in Iraq during
periods he is not working in Iraq. He credibly testified that his family in Iraq could not be
used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information.6
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
September  2015.  He  answered  in  the  negative  to  questions  about  foreign  military
service;  real  estate  in  a  foreign  country;  financial  support  for  a  foreign  national;  and
voting  in  a  foreign  election.  Applicant  testified  that  he  did  not  intend  to  provide  false
information. He did not think he had to report the information about Iraq, because as an
Iraqi  citizen,  Iraq  was  not  a  foreign  country  to  him.7  One  of  the  primary  definitions  of
foreign  by Merriam-Webster’s  dictionary  is “situated  outside  one’s  own  country.”  Since
Iraq was one of Applicant’s two countries, his interpretation is not unreasonable. In any
event, I find it was honest and genuine.
