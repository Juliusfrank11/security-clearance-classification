Applicant,  41,  has  worked  as  an  operations  analyst  for  a  federal  contracting
company  since  June  2017.  He  previously  served  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  May  2002  to
November  2016,  achieving  the  rank  of  major  (O-4).  He  was  initially  granted  access  to
classified  information  in  1996  during  his  service  in  the  Army  Reserve  Officer  Training
Corps  (ROTC).  He  completed  his  most  recent  security  clearance  application  in  May
2017,  disclosing  outstanding  federal  and  state  income  taxes  and  other  delinquent
accounts.  Based  on  Applicant’s  disclosures  and  information  developed  during  his
background  investigation,  the  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  owes  $65,000  in  delinquent
debt.  Most  of  the  alleged  debt  is  for  the  $26,900  past-due  balance  on  a  mortgage
account.3
Applicant’s  financial  problems  began  in  approximately  2008,  when  he  received
orders for his new duty station. His wife wanted to remain in State 1 in the family home
with  the  couple’s  two  minor  children.  Applicant  agreed  and  moved  to  his  new  duty
station  unaccompanied.  His  wife  did  not  work  outside  the  home,  so  Applicant  fully
supported  the  household  in  addition  to  paying  his  separate  living  expenses.  Applicant
and his wife separated in 2010. They did not have a formal separation agreement, but
Applicant  agreed  to  continue  the  support  arrangement,  which  cost  him  approximately
$2,000 per month. In addition, he also paid $452 in child support for his daughter from
another relationship.4
Applicant  maintained  this  arrangement  for  eight  years.  The  couple  agreed  to
continue  the  support  arrangement  in  their  2016  divorce  decree.  Applicant  struggled
financially and began to accumulate delinquent debt. He incurred a 2012 state income
tax balance after his tax preparer erroneously applied a tax credit that Applicant was not
entitled  to  receive.  Although  he  filed  his  2015  federal  income  returns  as  required,  he
could not afford to pay his additional tax obligation. He also began falling behind on the
mortgage of the family home in early 2016 and ultimately lost the house to foreclosure
in  October  2016.  After  separating  from  the  Army  in  November  2016,  Applicant  was
unemployed  for  seven  months  until  he  began  his  current  position.  While  unemployed,
he received $116 per week in unemployment compensation.5

When  Applicant  retuned  to  work  in  June  2017,  he  began  earning  $70,000
annually.  He  has  since  earned  a  raise  to  $84,000.  He  began  repaying  his  delinquent
debt.  To  date,  he  resolved  the  accounts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.c  ($6,619),  1.f  ($3,701),
1.h ($60), 1.j ($37), 1.k ($36), and 1.l ($32). He paid the outstanding state income taxes
alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.m  ($2,300)  in  October  2017.  He  claims  to  have  entered  into
payment  plans  to  resolve  the  student  loans  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.e  ($3,761)  and  1.g
($559)  and  the  federal  income  taxes  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.n  ($5,312)  since  May  2017,
paying $175 each month. However, he did not provide evidence of a payment history for
the accounts. Applicant’s home, which  was  secured by a loan from the Department of
Veterans Affairs, was sold at a foreclosure sale. He does not know how much the home
sold for and claims that the VA advised him that he does not owe a deficiency balance
on the loan. The record is unclear about the status of the mortgage loan alleged in SOR
¶ 1.a. The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($9,542) and 1.d ($6,351) remain unresolved.6
Applicant  lives  with  his  girlfriend  and  their  infant  daughter.  He  pays  $1,100  in
child support for his two minor children and provides his oldest son approximately $400
each month to help with his college expenses.7
