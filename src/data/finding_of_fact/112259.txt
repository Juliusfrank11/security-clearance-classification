Applicant  is  33  years  old,  unmarried,  and  has  no  children.  He  received  a  high
school diploma in 2004 in Iraq. From 2005 until October 2009, Applicant worked for the
U.S. military in Iraq as a security guard and as a local interpreter on U.S. military missions.
He immigrated to the United States in November 2009 on a special immigrant visa (SVI),
and he was naturalized in November 2015. He is attempting to get a job as a linguist for
a defense contractor. This is his first security clearance application. He has worked as a
truck driver for his current employer since 2006. (GE 1; AE C; Tr. 10, 16-21, 39)
Guideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant disclosed in his 2017 SCA that he used marijuana between August 2012
and  February  2016.  In  June  2012,  while  living  in  a  state  in  which  it  was  legal  to  use
medical  marijuana,  Applicant  broke  his  leg.  Two  months  later,  he  obtained  a  medical
marijuana card and started using marijuana as pain relief for the broken leg. He did not
renew the card when it expired in August 2013, but continued to use marijuana once a
month or every other month with friends and by himself for medical and personal reasons.
In his SCA, Applicant disclosed that he used marijuana only three to five times after his
leg healed. He told the government investigator during his May 1, 2017 interview that he
used marijuana one to two times a week for three months in 2012 to help him sleep. (GE
1 at 59; GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 2; Tr. 22-23, 25-26, 30-33)
In  2014,  Applicant  obtained  a  commercial  driver’s  license  (CDL)  from  the
Department of Transportation (DOT) to be a commercial truck driver. Applicant started
working for Company A as a commercial truck driver in August 2014. This company drug
screened  their  drivers  and  marijuana  use  was  not  permitted.  Applicant  had  a  pre-
employment urinalysis and one random urinalysis before he left Company A in May 2015.
Applicant continued working as a commercial driver for two other companies. For these
employments, he had pre-employment urinalyses tests.
In  February  2016,  Applicant  was  working  as  a  truck  driver  for  a  company  that
prohibited the use of drugs. He acknowledged that he was aware of his employer’s policy
that  employees  remain  drug-free,  and  he  was  subject  to  random  urinalysis  tests.
However, Applicant thought the policy only applied to when he was working, not during
off hours or “private time.” That month, Applicant took a random-work-related urinalysis,
which was positive for marijuana. At the hearing, Applicant testified that the last time he
used marijuana was approximately one week before this positive urinalysis. (GE 1 at 61;
Tr. 23-27)
Later during his testimony, Applicant claimed the positive urinalysis was the result
of exposure to second-hand smoke at a concert or from innocent ingestion. (Tr. 24, 26)
He also made this claim in his Answer to the SOR and in his May 1, 2017 background
interview. He also testified that he did not knowingly use marijuana after he received  a
CDL in 2014, because he knew it was forbidden by the DOT to use drugs and hold a CDL.
(Answer; GE 2 at 5; Tr. 26-29, 33-35)
The following colloquy occurred during the hearing:
Mr. Nagel: And you violated that rule?
Applicant: Well, not – I didn’t use marijuana on the job.
Mr. Nagel: Right.
Applicant: I used it as like, in my time off. But, I didn’t know that it stays in
the body for that long. And in that case – and that won’t actually – I didn’t
even use it. I think I had a second-hand smoke. I’m not sure about it, but….
(Tr. 24)
As a result of the positive urinalysis, Applicant was sent to drug treatment, but he
was ultimately released  by the employer. (GE 2 at 2-4; GE 3 at 1-2; AE B; Tr. 25, 35)
According to Applicant, February 2016 was the last time he was around people who were
using  marijuana.  (Tr.  23-25,  38)  His  last  drug  test  was  in  January  2018,  and  it  was
negative. (Tr. 37)
Guideline D: Sexual Behavior
In September 2011 Applicant was arrested in State A and charged with  forcible
rape in the second degree, a felony. He was handcuffed and taken to the police station,
fingerprinted,  and  photographed.  He  spent  four  days  in  jail;  met  the  $75,000  bail;  and
then consulted with an attorney. At the hearing, Applicant claimed the attorney told him
he  did  not  need  to  hire  anyone  to  represent  him.  He  testified  that  he  knew  he  was
arrested,  but  he  thought  he  was  just  accused,  not  charged,  which  is  why  he  did  not
disclose  the  arrest  in his SCA.  The  case  was  closed,  and  the  charges  were  ultimately
dismissed. (GE 1 at 58-59; GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 1-2; AE A; Tr. 44-50)
In  August  2011  Applicant  had  sex  with  a  women  he  met  through  a  dating
application. She told the police that their first interaction began as consensual; however,
she  requested that  Applicant  wear a  condom, he  refused  her request, their  interaction
then  became  non-consensual,  and  he  forcibly  had  vaginal/penile  intercourse  with  her.
Applicant told the police interviewer in September 2011 that the woman asked him to use
a condom, and he complied with her request. At the hearing, Applicant claimed he asked
the woman for a condom, which was inconsistent with his earlier version of events. (GE
2 at 7; GE 4; GE 5 at 12; Tr. at 40-45)
Applicant testified that they had sex one time, and it was consensual. The woman
told the police and gave a detailed description of how Applicant raped her a second time,
in late August 2011. Applicant forced his way into her apartment and then forced himself
on her again. The next day, she reported the rapes to the police. (GE 4; Tr. 45-46)
Applicant obtained copies of all of the police paperwork in 2014 before he applied
for his U.S. citizenship. In his Answer to the SOR, he denied that this was a felony charge,
but the documentary evidence reflects that he was charged with a felony. (Answer; GE 5;
AE A; Tr. 44, 50-51)
Guideline E: Personal Conduct
Despite obtaining a copy of the arrest record, as stated above, Applicant claimed
at the hearing and in his Answer that he was unaware that he was charged with felony-
level  rape.  In  his  April  2017  SCA,  Applicant  failed  to  disclose  that  he  was  arrested  in
September 2011, and charged with forcible rape, a felony. He did disclose that he used
marijuana  between  August  2012  and  February  2016  due  to  a  broken  leg.  Applicant
understood that when he signed the SCA, he certified that the information he provided
was correct. (Answer; GE 1 at 59-61; Tr. 53)
At the hearing, Applicant claimed he did not know he was actually charged with a
crime. When  he  was  questioned  as to  why  he  did  not  list  the  arrest  as  required  in  his
SCA, he claimed he disclosed the arrest in an earlier SCA. At the hearing, he provided a
February  28,  2017  “review  copy” of an SCA,  which  was  unsigned. In  the  review  copy,
Applicant  disclosed  the  rape  arrest  and  derogatory  gambling  information.  He  did  not
disclose the  gambling information  and  rape arrest  in  the  April 2017  SCA.1  There  is no
evidence that Applicant provided the review copy SCA to his employer or facility security
officer. (GE 1; AE D at 36, 39; Tr. 47-50, 54-63, 69-70)
Applicant also asserted at the hearing that an employee of his sponsor may have
modified his SCA before it was submitted to the government. Finally, Applicant admitted
that he was concerned that if he disclosed the rape arrest in his SCA, it might prohibit him
from being hired as an interpreter. (AE D; Tr. at 54-63, 69-70)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator on May 1, 2017 and by a
U.S. Army investigator in late May 2017. He disclosed the arrest in both interviews. (GE
2 at 4-5; GE 3 at 1-2; Tr. 56) During his second interview, Applicant stated that he thought
he disclosed the rape arrest in his SCA. (GE 3 at 10; Tr. 55-57, 64)
Applicant applied for a security clearance because he loved working with the U.S.
Army in Iraq. (Tr. 52, 67) He provided several documents relating to his valued work with
the U.S. Army in Iraq. (AE C)
1 Applicant disclosed in the February 2017 review copy of a SCA that from November 2015 to present he
had incurred $17,000 in gambling losses. “As of now I have close to 35000 [sic] in debt , [sic] but its [sic]
not  all  because  of  gambling.  I  still  make  payments  on  time  each  month  ,  [sic]  and  I  100%  on  [sic]  time
payments. But if i [sic] did not gamble , [sic] I could have paid all my debt long time ago. I have take  [sic]
action to stop gambling such as not keeping cash with me all of the time ,  [sic] and I have told some friends
about my gambling problem so they can keep me going on the right path of not gambling. And for now I  do
not gamble as much as before ,  [sic] and one of the reasons that I’m seeking overseas job is because I
want to stay as far as I can from any gambling.” (AE D at 39)
