The  first  paragraph  of  the  SOR  alleges  thirteen  delinquent  debts  under  the
financial  considerations  guideline.  Those  debts,  which  total  $51,311,  include  eight
student  loan  accounts  and  five  medical  accounts.  The  second  paragraph  lists  two
allegations  under  the  personal  conduct  guideline.  Applicant  admitted  all  allegations.
(Answer to SOR)
Applicant  is  31  years  old  and  single.  He  has  been  employed  as  a  service
technician for a defense contractor since February 2015. His job requires him to travel
to  job  sites  around  the  world,  and  erect  and  start  compressors  or  provide  general
maintenance  to  existing  units.  His  employment  between  2006  and  2014  was  in  low-
paying  jobs  as  a  car  salesman,  a  detailer,  jobs  in  fast  food  restaurants,  and  a  hotel
bellman. In September 2008, he earned an associate’s degree in business and collision
refinishing. Applicant has never held a security clearance. (GE 1 at 5-22, 36-37; Tr. 10)
Applicant  explained  in  his  May  2017  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)
interview (PSI) that the reasons for his financial problems were a lack of funds caused
by low paying jobs, and taking care of his father. As a result, he had trouble paying his
financial obligations. He believed the student loans at SOR 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l
were  consolidated.1  He  surmised  that  the  student  loan  at  SOR  1.m,  that  had  become
delinquent  in  November  2010,  had  been  consolidated  and  he  was  trying  to  settle  the
debt.  Applicant  believed  that  the  medical  accounts  at  SOR  1.b  through  1.f  had  been
1 These accounts became delinquent in July 2010. (AE 2 at 6)
settled. He informed the OPM investigator that he would contact the creditors and pay
the accounts. (AE 2 at 15)
During the hearing, Applicant testified that all the student loan accounts listed in
the  SOR  were  opened  to  finance  Applicant’s  associate’s  degree  which  he  received  in
September  2008.  He  conceded  that  the  SOR  1.a  student  loan  account  was  still  in
default and that he has to make arrangements to begin paying the account.  He had no
documents  showing  correspondence  with  the  student  loan  servicer.  His  only  contact
occurred by telephone. Regarding the student loan accounts at SOR 1.g through 1.l, he
indicated  that  the  servicer  for  the  accounts  informed  him  that  he  was  actually
responsible  for  12  loan  accounts.  Applicant  admitted  that  the  student  loan  account  at
SOR  1.m  was  in  default  and  he  intended  to  contact  the  servicer  to  bring  the  account
current.  The  only  documentary  evidence  that  Applicant  furnished  is  AE  A,  but  it  is
impossible to determine from the exhibit what action Applicant took to return any of the
student loan accounts to a current status. (GE 2 at 5-6, 15; AE A; Tr. 23, 25-26)
According to Applicant, the five medical accounts at SOR 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and
1.f,  resulted  from  a  single  trip  to  a  hospital  emergency  room.  He  was  prescribed
medication to alleviate the pain from a toothache until he could see a dentist. Applicant
could provide no explanation for why he received five bills for one emergency room visit.
He  was  not  certain  whether  he  had  medical  insurance  to  cover  the  emergency  room
treatment.  The  Government  credit  bureau  reports  reflect  that  the  medical  bills  were
incurred on five different occasions between May 2011 and July 2016. (GE 2 at 15-17;
GE 4 at 2; Tr. 24-25)
Applicant  testified  at  the  hearing  that  he  did  not  contact  and  negotiate
settlements with the listed creditors as he stated to the OPM investigator  in May 2017
because  of  his  work-related  travel.  He  is  out  of  the  office  three  to  four  days  a  week.
Though his employer’s policy is to have employees in the office 50 percent of the time
and on travel 50 percent of the time, sometimes he is out of the office up 80 percent of
the time. (Tr. 26-27)
Between  2013  and  2015,  Applicant  was  taking  care  of  his  father  who  was
unemployed.  Applicant  provided  money  and  food  to  his  father  during  this  period.  This
was  one  of  the  reasons  his  debts  became  delinquent.  His  father  resumed  working  in
2015. (GE 3 6-7; Tr. 28)
Another reason for Applicant’s delinquent debts was his low-paying employment
before  he  began  working  at  his  present  employer  in  February  2015.  His  monthly  take
home  pay  from  his  much  better  paying  current  job  is  between  $2,100  and  $2,200  a
month.  After  he  pays  his  monthly  expenses,  he  has  about  $400  to  $500  a  month  of
discretionary income left over. He has approximately $1,000 in his savings account. He
has never had financial counseling. (Tr. 29-30)
In his May 2017 PSI, Applicant indicated that his omission of information from his
e-QIP (SOR 2.a, 2.b) was inadvertent. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted falsifying
the  Section  26A  question  when  he  answered  “no”  to  being  delinquent  on  any  federal
debt, deliberately failing to disclose federal student loans at SOR 1.a and 1.g through 1.l
(SOR  2.a).  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  deliberately  falsifying  Section  26A
question when he answered “no” to having bills turned over to a collection agency in the
past seven (7) years (SOR 2.b). (GE 3 at 6; answer to SOR)
During  the  hearing,  Applicant  explained  the  reason  for  his  “no”  answer  to  SOR
2.a was not inadvertence as he stated in his May  2017 PSI. Rather, he testified, “from
what  I  [was]  paying  during  that  time  (October  2016),  I  thought  that  everything  was
consolidated, but it was not. So, I answered no because I believed I [was] current at that
current  time.”  Applicant  had  no  documents  to  verify  he  was  making  payments  in
October 2016 or that his student loans were current. Applicant’s testimonial explanation
for his  “no” answer to SOR  2.b  was  based  on  a  credit  report  he  claimed he  viewed  in
December 2015  showing  that  he had  no  collection  accounts.  (Answer to  SOR;  Tr.  30-
31)
Applicant’s post-hearing exhibit, AE A, two pages in length, is entitled “payment
history”  generated  by  the  student  loan  servicer  identified  in  SOR  1.a.  The  exhibit
contains  six  columns:  the  first  column  identifies  the  date  payments  were  made;  the
second  column  of  figures  is  labeled  payment  amount;  the  third  column  identifies  the
portion of the payment amount that was applied to the principal debt; the fourth column
identifies the portion of the payment amount that was applied to interest; the fifth column
identifies  the  payment  amount  that  applied  to  fees  (a  notation  on  the  second  page
indicates  the  United  States  Government  does  not  assess  late  or  returned  payment
fees);  and  the  sixth  column  identifies  the  payment  type.  The  sixth  column  (payment
type)  indicates  that  from  January  2013  to  June  2013,  Applicant  apparently  paid  the
student loan servicer by check on seven occasions. The payment type for the remaining
payments  is  labeled  “other.”  Applicant  supplied  no  explanation  for  how  to  define  the
“other” payment type.
AE A shows that all payments are below $175 except for a payment of $12,689
in  September  2015,  and  a  payment  a  $32,176,  the  only  payment  for  2018. Where  do
these large payments come from and are they payments or loan consolidations? Which
student loan account or accounts in AE A are listed in the SOR? AE A does not provide
answers to these two questions. AE A does not indicate whether any of the student loan
accounts  have  been  placed  in forbearance  or rehabilitation.  Applicant  testified  that  his
“no” answer to SOR 2.a was based on what he was paying at the time of the October
2016  e-QIP.  A  review  of  the  payment  dates  in  2016  show  that  he  made  five  $160
payments from February through June 2016, but no payments to the servicer from July
2016  through  October  2016.  In  November  2016,  he  made  a  payment  of  $160,  but  no
payment  in  December  2016.  He  made  only  four monthly  payments  in  2017,  two  $160
monthly  payments  and  one  $320  payment  (where  he  doubled  the  monthly  payment).
Due to the foregoing unanswered questions about the exhibit and the sporadic record of
payments shown within the exhibit, I can only assign limited weight to AE A. In addition,
Applicant  provided  no  documentary  evidence  indicating  that  he  has  taken  action  to
resolve the listed medical accounts. (Tr. 30-31; AE A)
