Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.h, and 1.i. She denied SOR ¶¶ 1.d,
1.f, 1.g, 1.j, and 2.a. She provided some explanations and a narrative statement, but she
provided  no  documents  with  her  Answer.  Her  admissions  and  other  comments  are
incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings
and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 32 years old. She graduated from high school in 2004. Since then, she
has worked as a sheet metal worker for a defense contractor at a naval shipyard. She
has never married. She has a 17-year-old son. She has never held a clearance before.
(Item  3)  On  her  May  2016  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  a  past-due  debt  relating  to  an
automobile, and said she was making payments. She did not disclose that she had any
other financial issues. (Item 3)
Under Guideline F, the Government first alleged that Applicant failed to timely file
her state and federal tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b)
The Government also alleged that she owed about $6,600 in unpaid federal taxes (SOR
¶  1.c),  an  undefined  amount  in  past-due  state  income  taxes  (SOR  ¶  1.d),  and  about
$28,240 in other delinquent debts, all to private creditors. (SOR ¶¶ 1.e – 1.j)
Applicant  discussed  her  delinquent  debts  in  her  September  2017  background
interview. She also acknowledged that she did not file her state and federal income tax
returns on time for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016, information she did not disclose on
her SCA. She acknowledged in her background interview that she decided not to file her
tax returns because she could not pay what she owed. She intended to save money and
file her returns when she could afford to do so. (Item 3 at 22; Item 4 at 9)
Applicant  authenticated  the  summary  of  her  background  interview  in  an
interrogatory response she submitted to the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals in
March 2018. She also reported that she had filed her state and federal income tax returns
for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016, when she filed her 2017 taxes. She did not provide
documentation  to  corroborate  her  assertion.  She  acknowledged  that  she  owed  about
$6,600 in past-due federal income taxes. (Item 4 at 2)
In  SOR  ¶  1.d,  the  Government  alleges  that  Applicant  owes  an  “undetermined
amount” in past-due state income taxes. Applicant denied the allegation in her Answer.
In her Interrogatory Response, Applicant answered “No” to the question, “Do you currently
owe back State taxes?” and there is no other indication in the record that she owes any
past-due state taxes. (Items 1, 3, 4)
The  remaining  SOR  allegations  concern  debts  to  private  creditors.  Applicant
admitted some and denied others. She provided no supporting documentation with her
Answer.
SOR ¶ 1.e is a $15,227 charged-off debt. Credit reports from July 2016, November
2016, and June 2018 reflect that it relates to an automobile account. Applicant was initially
current on the account but later fell behind on payments, and it is now charged off. (Items
5, 6, 7) Applicant admitted the debt in her Answer without further comment. She provided
no updated information on the debt’s current status.
Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  1.f,  a  charged-off  debt  for  $188,  and  said  she  did  not
recognize it. The account is listed on Applicant’s credit reports, but they also indicate that
she is disputing the debt. (Items 5, 6)
SOR ¶ 1.g is a $146 debt to an unspecified medical creditor. Applicant denies the
debt, saying she does not recognize it and cannot pay it. The debt is listed on Applicant’s
November 2017 credit report, as alleged, but it is not listed on the others. No account
number is provided, and the medical creditor is not named. (Item 6)
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges a debt that has been charged off and remains delinquent. No
amount is alleged as being delinquent. The debt is to a jewelry store. Applicant admitted
the debt without further details. The debt is listed on the November 2017 and June 2018
credit  reports  as  having  been  charged  off  and  sold  to  another  creditor.  The  past-due
amount is listed as $0. (Items 3, 5, 6)
SOR ¶ 1.i is a $12,126 judgment issued against Applicant in November 2010. The
debt relates to an automobile. (Item 7 at 2) The debt is not listed on later credit reports.
Applicant admitted the debt and asserted that she has been making monthly payments
on it. This may be the account listed on her SCA. Applicant provided no corroborating
documentation of any payments made.
SOR ¶ 1.j is a $553 debt to a collection agency. It is listed on Applicant’s July 2016
credit report as having become delinquent a month earlier. (Item 7 at 4) Applicant denied
the  debt  in  her  Answer,  stating  that  she  did  not  recognize  it.  She  provided  no
documentation about the debt’s current status.
Under Guideline E, SOR ¶ 2.a alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose
her state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016 when she
submitted her SCA in May 2016. The relevant question asked, “In the last seven (7) years,
have  you  failed  to  file  or  pay  Federal,  state  or  other  taxes  when  required  by  law  or
ordinance?”  (Item  3)  Applicant  answered  “No”  to  this  question  on  her  May  2016  SCA.
Since  the  2016  tax  year  was  ongoing  at  that  point,  Applicant’s  2016  state  and  federal
income tax returns were not due until spring 2017.
Applicant denied SOR ¶ 2.a, stating that her omission was not intentional and was
an “honest mistake,” since she misread the question. She also noted that she disclosed
her  unfiled  tax  returns  during  her  background  interview  (which  the  summary  of  the
interview confirms). (Items 2, 4)
Applicant concluded her Answer by stating that she had financial issues at an early
age  but  that  the  best decision  she  made  is to  build  a  career  at  the  shipyard.  She has
never been questioned or investigated at work. She takes her job and its responsibilities
seriously and takes great pride in the important work she does there. (Item 3)
