Applicant admitted all the allegations with some explanation. The admissions are
adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make
the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 44 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since January
2017.  Between  2012  and  2017,  he  worked  as  a  non-DOD  contractor  performing
carpentry  duties.  He  also  experienced  multiple  periods  of  unemployment  during  this
time frame. He has never married. He has one adult child.1
The SOR alleged Applicant’s failure to timely file his 2012-2015 federal and state
tax  returns.  It  alleged  he  owed  the  Federal  Government  for  delinquent  taxes  in  the
amount of approximately $13,000 for tax year 2009, approximately $6,485 for tax year
2010,  and  approximately  $341  for  tax  year  2014.  It  also  alleged  he  owed  on  four
collection accounts totaling approximately $671. Applicant admitted in his August 2017
statement to a defense investigator and in his answer to the SOR that he failed to file
his  2012-2015  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  and  that  he  owed  the  alleged
amount for delinquent federal taxes for tax years 2009, 2010, and 2014. Credit reports
from July 2017, March 2018, and June 2018 support the remaining delinquent debts.2
Applicant  was  sent  a  set  of  interrogatories  where,  inter  alia,  he  was  asked  to
provide  his  federal  and  state  tax  transcripts  for the  years  in  question.  He  provided  the
following  transcripts  for  his  federal  returns:  2015  (return  filed  October  2017);  2014
(return filed September 2017); 2013 (return filed October 2017); and no transcript was
provided for 2012. Concerning his state tax returns, he did not provide any  transcripts
for  the  alleged  years  2012-2015.  He  provided  no  other  evidence  that  the  remaining
federal and state tax returns were filed.3
Applicant  claims  he  hired  an  attorney  in  June  2017,  who  was  working  with  the
IRS to resolve his debt through a payment plan. He failed to provide documentary proof

2 Items 2, 3-6.
3 Items 1,3; Answer; AE A.
of any agreement reached with the IRS or any written proof of payment for his IRS tax
debt. Applicant’s tax issues are unresolved.4
Applicant  claimed  he  paid  the  four  alleged  consumer  debts,  but  he  failed  to
present documentation evidencing these payments. These debts are unresolved. He did
not provide any information about his current financial situation or a budget. There is no
evidence of financial counseling.5
