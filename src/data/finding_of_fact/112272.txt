Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $524,191 for four
delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a – 1.d). The $67,363 debt alleged at SOR 1.c is for
unpaid federal income taxes for the 2014 tax year. The $425,873 debt alleged at SOR
1.d  is  for  a  delinquent  small  business  loan  being  enforced  by  a  civil  judgment  against
Applicant, whose pay is being garnished at a rate of $400 every other week. In response,
Applicant denied SOR 1.a – 1.c, but admitted SOR 1.d. As to SOR 1.b, Applicant averred,
and  the  Government  agreed,  that  the  credit  card  at  issue  belonged  to  his  father  (now
deceased). SOR 1.b is resolved for Applicant. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 35, 41)
The remaining SOR allegations are supported by Applicant’s e-QIP disclosures,
his responses to DOHA interrogatories and the SOR, and three credit reports obtained
during Applicant’s background investigation and by DOD CAF adjudicators. In addition to
the facts thus established, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 63 years old and employed by a defense contractor in a position that
requires  eligibility  for  a  position  of  trust,  because  his  duties  include  safeguarding
personally  identifiable information  (PII) and  access  to  sensitive  facilities.  Applicant  has
worked for his current employer since January 2017. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 38)

2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017.
3 AX E is a letter of recommendation, dated December 16, 2018 (one page); AX F is a repayment agreement
regarding the debt alleged at SOR 1.a, dated March 28, 2018 (one page); AX G is a billing statement from
Applicant’s accountant, dated May 31, 2016 (one page); AX H is billing and payment information from a tax
preparation  service,  dated  June  6,  2013  (two  pages);  and  AX  I  is  a  copy  of  Applicant’s  most  recent
performance evaluation, dated November 27, 2018 (five pages).
After graduating from high school, Applicant received training as a paramedic and
has worked in that field for most of his adult life. He and his wife have been married since
July 1982. He has three children, all adults with children of their own. Applicant and his
family lived in State A until 2001. Since then, he has resided in State B, residing in, and
paying the mortgage for, a house owned by his late father. Applicant currently is the sole
income earner for his wife, who is medically disabled, and two of his adult children and
their three children, two of whom have special needs. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; AX A; AX D;
Tr. 51 – 54)
In 1998, while working in State A as a self-employed paramedic, Applicant sought
to  expand  his  business  by  seeking  a  contract  for  non-emergency  patient  transport
services with a city in State A. As a prerequisite for such a contract, he obtained from the
city a certificate of need for those services. That certificate was valid for a limited period
of time, in which it was incumbent on Applicant to get his business up and running. To
that  end,  he  obtained  approval  for  a  loan  to  be  guaranteed  by  the  Small  Business
Administration (SBA) through a local bank. With part of the money he had requested in
hand, Applicant proceeded to obtain equipment and to lease and renovate a building to
house his business. Unfortunately, the bank that was to provide the loan failed to fully
fund the loan Applicant had requested. Before Applicant could resolve matters with the
bank  (which  later  went  out  of  business),  the  certificate  of  need  expired  and  Applicant
could not begin doing business with the city as he had planned. He had to auction off the
equipment  he  had  purchased,  but  still  owed  between  $150,000  and  $200,000  for  the
portion of the loan that was funded, which he could not afford to pay. (Answer; GX 1; GX
2; AX A; Tr. 32 – 35, 54 – 58)
In 2002, after the original lender went out of business, the creditor listed in SOR
1.d bought the  account  and  obtained  a  civil  judgment  against  Applicant  to  enforce the
debt through levy and wage garnishment. Over the past 18 years, the amount owed under
that judgment, has grown to more than $608,000 as a result of a 10 percent interest rate
assigned  to  the  debt.  Starting  in  2002,  every  time  Applicant  has  obtained  new
employment, as much as 25 percent of his pay has been garnished by the creditor. On
one  occasion,  the  garnishment made  it more  advantageous for Applicant  to  choose to
collect unemployment and public assistance rather than work for a net income that was
insufficient,  after  garnishment,  to  support  his  family.  In  2014,  Applicant  exhausted  his
retirement  savings  account  ($8,700)  in  an  unsuccessful  attempt  to  settle  this  debt.
Currently, $400 of Applicant’s bi-weekly pay is garnished for this debt. In 2013, Applicant
consulted  a  bankruptcy  attorney  who  advised  him  that  he  could  not  include  an  SBA-
guaranteed  loan  in  a  bankruptcy  petition.  At  the  current  rate  of  wage  garnishment,
Applicant will be unable to resolve the SOR 1.d debt in his lifetime.  (Answer; GX 1; GX
2; AX A; AX B; Tr. 26 – 27, 41 – 43, 60 – 61)
Applicant’s business continued after his failed attempt to expand. He did not wrap
up the incorporated business until 2016. The tax debt addressed in SOR 1.c arose after
he used a nationally-known tax service to prepare his state and federal returns starting in
2014. That tax service characterized Applicant’s business as a Subchapter-S corporation,
meaning that any income from the business flowed through the business to Applicant as
personal  income.  Because  of  these  complications,  Applicant  was  late  in  filing  his  tax
returns  between  2012  and  2015.4  In  2016,  when  Applicant  filed  his  2014  tax  return,  it
resulted in a debt for unpaid income taxes totaling about $50,000. That debt has since
grown,  through  interest  and  penalties,  to nearly  $68,000.  In  2016,  Applicant  consulted
with an accountant who advised that filing as a Subchapter-S corporation was a mistake
and that he should have filed as a sole proprietor. Applicant has no outstanding federal
and state income tax returns and he is currently negotiating a monthly repayment plan
with the IRS. He does not yet know how much he will have to pay, but he has obtained a
second job with a medical transport company to earn the extra money he will need for
that debt. Applicant disclosed the debt in his e-QIP, but it is not listed as a delinquency in
any of the credit reports obtained by the Government. (Answer; GX 1 – 5; AX A; AX B;
AX G; AX H; Tr. 34 – 36, 43 – 48, 50, 59 – 60)
In  addition  to  being  self-employed,  Applicant  worked  in  several  paramedic  and
emergency medical services positions between 2002 and 2016. A job as a paramedic on
an  offshore  oil  platform  provided  him  with  a  significant  increase  in  pay  and  benefits;
however, he lost that job in May 2016 due to a fall in oil prices that resulted in numerous
oil-industry  layoffs.  Applicant  was  unemployed from  May  2016  until  being  hired  for  his
current  job  in  January  2017.  While  he  was  unemployed,  Applicant  relied  on
unemployment benefits and food assistance programs to support his family. He also used
a credit card to make ends meet, but he was unable to stay current on the balance due.
That debt is reflected in SOR 1.a. After Applicant started his current job and again had a
steady  income,  he  entered  into  a  repayment  agreement  whereby  he  would  pay  $100
monthly on this debt. In March 2018, Applicant negotiated a new repayment plan and now
pays  $25  monthly  until  February  2019,  at  which  time  he  will  be  able  make  further
settlement arrangements. (Answer; GX 1 – 5; AX A; AX F; Tr. 36 – 37, 40)
Applicant  currently  has  little  money  remaining  each  month  after  expenses,
including  debt  repayments  and  garnishments.  His  wife  suffers  from  serious  medical
problems, the medications for which cost as much as $3,000 each month. His medical
insurance only covers 80 percent of her medical bills. He and his wife have applied for
Social Security disability benefits, but that process is not likely to finish for another year.
Applicant  has  not  incurred  any  new  unpaid  debts  since  he  started  working  again  in
January  2017.  He  is  well-regarded  by  his  current  supervisor  as  reliable,  honest,
hardworking, and professional. Applicant’s only performance evaluation to date reflects
excellent work and trustworthiness. (Answer; GX 1 – 5; AX A; AX E; AX I; Tr. 48 – 50)
Eligibility for a position of public trust must be based on a determination that it is
“clearly consistent with the interests of national security” to do so.5 All such adjudications
