Applicant admitted to all the allegations of the SOR, except for SOR ¶¶ 1.b., 1.e.,
1.f., 1.i., 1.l., and 1.q. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and
testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 13 line
2 to page 18 line 4, and GX 1 at pages 5 and12~13.) He has been employed, part time,
with  the  defense  contractor  since  about  November  of  2015.  He  is  divorced,  and  has
three children, two of which he is paying child support for. (TR at page 13 line 2 to page
18 line 4.) He is homeless, and lives in his car. (TR at page 33 lines 15~21.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a.  Applicant  admits  a  state  tax  lien  to  his  former  state  of  residence  in  the
amount of about $553. (TR at page 18 line 11 to page 20 line 11.) Despite having two
months to do so, Applicant has submitted nothing further in this regard. This allegation
is found against Applicant.
1.b.  Applicant  denies  that  he  has  an  outstanding  judgment  to  Creditor  B  in  the
amount of about $1,828. (TR at page 20 line 12 to page 21 line 9.) As this outstanding
judgment  appears  on  the  Government’s  February  2016  credit  report  (CR);  and  as
Applicant  has  submitted  nothing  further  in  this  regard,  this  allegation  is  found  against
Applicant. (GX 3 at page 3.)
1.c. Applicant admits that he has a past-due debt to Creditor C in the amount of
about  $395.  (TR  at  page  21  line  10  to  page  22  line  6.)  As  he  has  submitted  nothing
further in this regard, this allegation is found against Applicant.
1.d. Applicant admits that he has past-due child support payments totaling about
$12,436. He avers that he is paying about $120 each month by way of garnishment to
address this admitted debt. (TR at page 22 line 8 to page 24 line 12.) As Applicant has
submitted nothing further in this regard, this allegation is found against Applicant.
1.e.  Applicant denies that he has a past-due debt to Creditor E in the amount of
about $7,202. (TR at page 24 line 13 to page 25 line 7, and at page 25 line 24 to page
26 line 7.) As this past-due debt appears on the Government’s October 2017 CR; and
as Applicant has submitted nothing further in this regard, this allegation is found against
Applicant. (GX 4 at page 2.)
1.f. Applicant denies that he has a past-due debt to Creditor F in the amount of
about $2,314. (TR at page 25 lines 8~23, and at page 26 lines 8~10.) As this past-due

nothing further in this  regard,  this allegation is found against Applicant.  (GX  4 at page
2.)
1.g. Applicant admits that he has a past-due debt to Creditor G in the amount of
about $2,058. (TR at page 26 lines 11~24.) As he has submitted nothing further in this
regard, this allegation is found against Applicant.

amount totaling about $1,766. (TR at page 26 line 25 to page 27 line 9, and at page 27
line  20  to  page  28  line  3.)  As  he  has  submitted  nothing  further  in  this  regard,  these
allegations are found against Applicant.

about  $683.  (TR  at  page  27  lines  10~19.)  As  this  past-due  debt  appears  on  the
Government’s October 2017 CR; and as Applicant has submitted nothing further in this
regard, this allegation is found against Applicant. (GX 4 at page 2.)
1.k.~1.r. Applicant, at his hearing, now admits that he has eight past-due debts to
eight separate creditors in an amount totaling about $20,021.  (TR at page 28 line 4 to
page 29 line 2, and at page 30 lines 4~11.) As he has submitted nothing further in this
regard, these allegations are found against Applicant.
1.s.  and  1.t.  Applicant  admits  that  he  has  past-due  student  loans totaling  about
$80,000. (TR at page 30 line 12 to page 32 line 12.)  They were once in “forbearance”;
