In her SOR answer, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b,
1.d through 1.f, and 1.h. She denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.g. Applicant’s
admissions to the SOR and those at her hearing are incorporated herein as findings of
fact.  After  a  thorough  review  of  the  record  evidence,  including  her  testimony  and
demeanor while testifying, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  She  completed  a
bachelor’s degree in May 2012, and a master’s degree in 2015, both in criminal justice.
She  married  her  first  spouse  in  2007,  separated  in  2009,  and  divorced  in  2012.  She
married her second spouse in 2012 and divorced in 2016. She has two children, ages
18 and 10.
In  her  May  2016  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  that  she had financial problems  that
included  a  repossessed  car  and  numerous  delinquent  credit  accounts,  most  of  them
alleged  in  the  SOR.  Applicant  credibly  explained  that  her  financial  problems  resulted
from  her  extensive  periods  of  unemployment,  her  2012  divorce,  several  relocations  to
different  states  seeking  help  from  family  members  or  job  opportunities,  and  she  being
the sole provider for her children. Applicant noted that one of her children is entitled to
court-ordered financial support; however, the father only provides sporadic support and
is  in  arrears.  (Tr.  25)  Additionally,  Applicant’s  78-year-old  mother  developed  breast
cancer, and Applicant moved to another state to care for her mother and provided her
with some financial assistance.
Applicant’s  employment  history  shows  that  she  worked  as  a  city  police  officer
between 2001 and October 2005. She was laid off after a hurricane destroyed the city’s
infrastructure  and  was  unemployed  between  October  2005  and  June  2006.  She  was
employed between June 2006 and February 2009, as an assistant bank manager. She
was unemployed between February 2009 and January 2010. She was employed during
a  probationary  period  as  a  city  police  officer  between  January  2010  and  December
2012.  She  was  not  offered  the  position  after  the  probationary  period  ended,  and  was
unemployed between December 2011 and October 2012.
Applicant  was  employed  as  a  part-time  legal  clerk  between  October  2012  and
August  2014,  and  unemployed  between  August  2014  and  November  2014.  She  was
employed  with  a  Federal  agency  between  November  2014  and  January  2015,  and
unemployed between January and March 2015. She was rehired by the federal agency
in March 2015 and worked there until March 2016. Her current employer and clearance
sponsor, a federal contractor, hired Applicant in March 2016, and she was been working
there until the present.
Most  of  the  alleged  SOR  debts  date  back  to  the  period surrounding  Applicant’s
2009  marital  separation  and  2012  divorce.  She  stated  that  she  did  not  address  her
delinquent debts sooner because she believed they were paid by her ex-husband after
the  divorce.  She  realized  she  had  delinquent  debts  when  she  received  the  January
2018 SOR. Applicant explained that even if she had known about her delinquent debts
sooner, she was the sole breadwinner of the family, and her income was insufficient to
pay her family’s living expenses and pay her debts.
Since  January  2018,  Applicant  has  been  diligently  addressing  her  delinquent
accounts.  The  SOR  alleged  eight  delinquent  or  charged-off  accounts.  Applicant’s
documentary evidence (AE 1) shows that she settled and paid seven of the SOR debts
(¶¶ 1.a through 1.f and 1.h).
The  remaining  debt,  SOR  ¶  1.g,  alleged  a  delinquent  car  note  for  $12,985.
Applicant and her first husband purchased a car in 2008. When they separated in 2009,
her ex-husband promised to make the car payments, but he failed to do so. When the
creditor  confronted  her  with  the  delinquent  payments,  she  voluntarily  surrendered  the
car to the creditor. I note that the debt is more than seven years old, and as such it is
uncollectable. Her ex-husband has some responsibility for paying the debt. Additionally,
Applicant  disputed  the  debt  (GE  2),  and  it  is  no  longer  reflected  on  Applicant’s  more
recent credit reports.
Applicant  acknowledged  that  she  should  have  been  more  diligent  paying  her
delinquent accounts. However, she believes she was doing the best she could do under
her circumstances. She understands the seriousness of the security concerns raised by
her financial problems. Applicant credibly promised to timely pay her debts in the future
and to resolve her financial problems.
Applicant  believes  that  with  her  current  income,  her  financial  situation  is  now
stable,  and  she  will  be  able  to  maintain  her  financial  responsibility  and  eligibility  for  a
clearance. Her hourly wage is $30.80, and she makes between $75,000 and $85,000 a
year, depending on overtime. Applicant has not received financial counseling, but she is
following a budget, subscribed to credit reporting agencies to keep track of her finances,
and purchased books to help her improve her credit. (Tr. 22-23).
Applicant  owes  about  $130,000  in  student  loans.  She  is  current  on  her  student
loan  payments  and  is  paying  them  under  an  income-based  repayment  plan.  Applicant
understands  that  for  her  to  be  eligible  for  a  clearance,  and  her  job  with  a  Federal
contractor, she has to maintain and demonstrate her financial responsibility. A review of
Applicant’s most recent credit reports shows that she has no current delinquencies, and
she is keeping up on her finances.
