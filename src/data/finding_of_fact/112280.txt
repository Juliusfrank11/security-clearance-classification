Applicant,  45,  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  federal  contractor,  since
December 2003. He completed a security clearance, his first, in April 2017. The ensuing
investigation revealed undisclosed federal income tax and delinquent consumer debts.
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  owes  $19,000  in  unpaid  federal  tax  debt  for  the  2013
through 2016 tax years, and three delinquent accounts totaling $3,300.3
Between  2009  and  2012,  Applicant  timely  filed  his  federal  income  tax  returns
using  the  “head  of  household”  filing  status.  In  2013,  his  wife  started  a  small  business.
However,  she  did  not  pay  income  or  self-employment  taxes  as  she  earned  income.
Sometime after starting the business, she experienced a health crisis that affected her
ability  to  work.  During  her  ailment,  she  hired  employees  to  ensure  the  business
remained  a  going  concern.  Although  Applicant  filed  his  2013  through  2016  federal
income tax returns on time, he could not afford to pay his federal tax obligations when
they were due.4
According  to  the  tax  transcripts  in  the  record,  Applicant  owes  $2,433  in  federal
income  taxes  for  2013,  $3,002  for  2014,  $8,887  for  2015,  and  $3,844  for  2016.  He
established an installment agreement for the 2013 taxes in April 2014. He did not make
any  payments  under  the  agreement  and  the  IRS  terminated  it  February  2015.  He
attempted to establish an installment agreement for the 2014 though 2016 income tax
obligations  in  April  2017;  however,  the  installment  agreement  was  terminated  that
month.  In  March  2017,  Applicant  consulted  a  law  firm  specializing  in  tax  issues  to
negotiate a settlement with the IRS on his behalf. He claims that the firm advised him to
stop  making  payments  on  the  tax  debt  until  they  reached  a  settlement.  In  his  SOR
answer, Applicant claims that as of March 2018, he established a payment plan with the
IRS for $300 each month. He provided evidence of the first two payments.5
Applicant admits he owes the three delinquent consumer accounts alleged in the
SOR (¶ 1.e, $2,255; ¶ 1.f, $1008; and ¶ 1.g, $32). He claims that he has entered into a
payment  plan  for  $100  each  month  for  SOR  ¶  1.e  beginning  in  March  2018  and
provided evidence of the first two payments. He also claims to have resolved the debt
alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.g,  but  did  not  provide  proof  of  payment.  The  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.f

remains unresolved. The record does not contain information about Applicant’s current
household finances.6
