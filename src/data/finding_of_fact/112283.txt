After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 53 years old and a high school graduate. (Tr. 16.) He and his spouse
married in 2000. They have three children.1 Applicant owned and operated an auto sales
business for about 15 years until September 2005. He sold the business to care for his
wife, who had been injured in a car accident in 2005. (GE 1, Tr. 95.) She returned to work
in  the  mutual  funds  industry  within  weeks  of  her  surgery  (Tr.  76),  but  Applicant  was
1 On his SF 86, Applicant listed a biological son, now age 17, and two adopted daughters, now ages 15 and
21. (GE 1; Tr. 29.) The daughters’ surname is the same as his spouse’s maiden name. (GE 1.)
unemployed for over a year. (GE 1.) Unbeknownst to Applicant at the time, his spouse
began gambling at a local casino in 2005. (99, 102.)
In January 2007, Applicant purchased a vehicle towing business. (GE 1; Tr. 19.) He
later learned that the company had a lawsuit pending against it from an accident caused by
the previous owner’s son. Applicant spent about two years in arbitration.  He states that he
did not make much money in the towing business, but he had a towing contract with the
local police. (GE 1; Tr. 50.)
In April 2008, Applicant purchased a home for his family, obtaining a mortgage loan
for $130,050. (GEs 2-4.) His spouse had a motor vehicle accident in 2008. (Tr. 77.) In
January 2010, Applicant sold the towing business after his contract with the local police
was not renewed. (GE 1; Tr. 29-30.) Applicant had no employment income from January
2010 until October 2016. In late 2010, his spouse needed additional surgery after being
rear-ended a third time. (Tr. 96-97.) In contrast to her previous surgeries, where she was
able to return to work within weeks, she had debilitating pain. She developed an addiction
to opiate medication.2  (Tr. 78-79, 100-101.)
In January 2011, the IRS filed a $20,269 tax lien against Applicant and his spouse
for unpaid taxes for tax year 2007. (GE 3.) His spouse had taken a premature withdrawal of
her 401(k) assets, in part to fund her gambling. (Tr. 71, 102.) They filed an amended tax
return for 2007 and paid the tax debt in December 2011.3 (GE 3; Tr. 103.) In September
2011, Applicant’s sister died unexpectedly in a car accident. Applicant’s parents provided a
home for his sister’s children, who were then ages 17, 19, and 20, but Applicant and his
spouse helped the children financially. (GE 1; Tr. 22-23, 82.)
In March 2012, Applicant’s parents purchased a two-family property, obtaining a
mortgage  for  approximately  $100,000.4  The  plan  was  to  provide  a  home  for  their
grandchildren who had lost their mother and obtain a renter for the other unit. Applicant
relied on his personal credit cards to pay for renovations and refurbishing the property. (Tr.
49, 83.) He completed the renovation work himself, which took him over a year. His father
died within the next year or so, and his mother inherited the property. The property has had
tenants  on  and  off.  The  present  rent  is  $1,800  a  month.  (Tr.  31-32,  37.)  Apart  from
2 Applicant’s spouse began taking a prescribed narcotic in 2008. Her physician switched her to oxycodone and
increased her dosages. Eventually, he prescribed 12-hour release Oxycontin. She was slowly weaned off
opiates under the care of a physician from 2013 to 2015. (Tr. 100-101.)
3 Neither Applicant nor his spouse had employment income at the time, although Applicant’s spouse had some
settlement money from her accidents. There is no explanation in the record for the source of the tax payment.
4 Applicant indicated on his SF 86 that he has “acted as Property Manager/Owner” since 2012. (GE 1.) When
he was interviewed in February 2017, he explained that he did not own the property but instead manages it for
his mother. (GE 5.) At his hearing, he responded affirmatively when asked to confirm that  he bought the
property in March 2012 and that he has been renting it out for the past five years. After paying the mortgage at
approximately $600 a month, property taxes, and expenses, the remaining rental income is $500 a month if
the  property  is  fully  rented.  (Tr.  33-34.)  There  is  no  open  mortgage  on  Applicant’s  credit  reports  for  the
property. It appears that his mother makes the mortgage payment. Applicant subsequently confirmed that the
rental property belongs to his mother, and she receives the rental income. (Tr. 49-50.)
managing the property part time for his mother, Applicant had no other employment. (GE
1.)
Applicant’s  spouse  received  settlements  from  her  three  car  accidents  totaling
approximately $117,000.5 (Tr. 97.) Applicant bought a 2007 model-year car for $27,000
cash in 2012. They paid for their son’s expenses playing baseball and some household
bills. They also put some of the money into remodeling the house his parents bought. His
spouse also gambled away some of the money.  (GE 5; Tr. 35-36, 81, 98.) She played
poker at a local casino from 2005 to 2012 and hid her gambling with $3,000 to $6,000 of
household income per month from Applicant. (Tr. 99-100.) After Applicant learned about
the IRS tax lien, she admitted to him that she was addicted to pain medication and had
been  gambling.  Facing  divorce  and  not  wanting  to  break  up  the  family,  she  stopped
gambling in 2012. (Tr. 102.)
Applicant and his spouse twice considered filing for bankruptcy but wanted to pay
their debts. When Applicant filled out his application to work for a defense contractor in
2016,  they  heard  that  “you  can’t  have  a  bankruptcy  on  your  record,”  so  they  decided
against filing. (Tr. 84-85.)
On  July  27,  2016,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  incorporated  within  an  e-QIP.
Concerning  any  financial  delinquency  involving  enforcement  in  the  last  seven  years,
Applicant listed the federal tax lien that was repaid (allegation withdrawn). He listed no
other  delinquencies  involving  enforcement,  and  responded  “No”  to  whether  he  had  a
judgment entered against him in the last seven years. Concerning delinquencies involving
routine accounts, Applicant listed one debt: a $9,000 state tax delinquency from 2005 that
he was reportedly repaying at $50 a month (not alleged). Applicant responded negatively to
inquiries concerning any other delinquency involving routine accounts, including whether
he had any bills or debts turned over to a collection agency in the last seven years and
whether he had any accounts or credit cards suspended, charged off, or cancelled for
failing to pay as agreed in the last seven years.6 (GE 1.)
A check of Applicant’s credit on August 27, 2016, revealed two unpaid judgment
debts for $7,489 from July 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.k) and $2,104 from October 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.j); a
charged-off  credit  card  debt  for $12,311  (SOR  ¶  1.a); and  six  collection debts totaling
$14,165 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.d and 1.f-1.h). (GE 2.)
After  four  years  with  no  employment  other  than  managing  his  mother’s  rental
property,  Applicant  began  working as an outside machinist for a defense contractor in
5 Applicant apparently had a cash-out of $47,100 from his credit union account. He indicated that it was from
his spouse’s insurance settlement (GE 5), which she recalls receiving in 2012. (Tr. 81.)
6  The Government’s withdrawal of the personal conduct allegations  removes falsification as a potentially
disqualifying concern. What Applicant knew about his finances remains an issue because of its implications
for his current and future financial management and financial judgment.
October 2016 after two weeks of paid training in September 2016. (GEs 1, 5; Tr. 17.) His
starting hourly wage was just over $17 an hour. (Tr. 20.)
On February 28, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant was asked whether he had any
debts over 120 days overdue or in collection within the last seven years that had not been
listed on his SF 86. He responded negatively and was then confronted with the adverse
credit information on his record. Applicant did not dispute the delinquencies, but he was
unable to provide any details about the debts. He indicated that his spouse was aware of
them and that they were making payments. He attributed his financial difficulties to his
periods of unemployment and his spouse having had multiple car accidents and surgeries.
He  denied  that  any  of  the  financial  issues  were  due  to  gambling  or alcohol.  Applicant
described his finances as improving now that he had income from his defense-contractor
employment. (GE 5.)
As of June 26, 2017, Equifax was reporting that Applicant’s home loan had been
modified under a federal government program in September 2015. His home mortgage had
been  delinquent  throughout  the  fall  of  2014.  (GE  4.)  The  delinquency  and  payment
histories for the accounts in the SOR are as follows:
Charged-off debt for $10,100 (SOR ¶ 1.a)
Applicant’s  credit  card  account,  opened  in  February  1992,  was  charged  off  for
$12,311 in June 2014 after becoming delinquent in September 2012. (GE 2.) The card was
used to remodel the home for his parents. (Tr. 81-82.) As of May 2017, the account was
past due for $10,100. (GE 3.) Applicant was brought to court over the debt, and he agreed
to garnishment of his wages at $75 a week. His wages were garnished throughout 2017.7
(GE 4; AE A; Tr. 27, 41, 59.) The garnishment stopped because he lost his job with the
defense  contractor.  As  of  January  2018,  Equifax  was  reporting  a  past-due  balance  of
$7,925. (GE 4.) Applicant made no payments on his own after garnishment stopped. (Tr.
41-42.)  His  spouse  testified  that  when  he  became  unemployed,  she  contacted  the
collection agency to renegotiate the terms of repayment. Applicant and his spouse are
waiting for a decision on his security clearance eligibility before resuming payments. (Tr.
58-59.)
Charged-off debt for $4,688 (SOR ¶ 1.b)
Applicant’s credit card account, opened in September 2006, became delinquent in
April 2013. It went into collections in August 2013 before being charged off for  $4,701.
(GEs 2, 4.) One payment was made in December 2016 to reduce the past-due balance to
$4,668. (GEs 3, 4.) As of January 2018, Appellant and his spouse  were attempting to
negotiate a payoff of his debt. (Tr. 42.) The creditor agreed to settle for $2,600, but they
have been unable to commit to the payment without knowing whether Applicant would
regain his job with the defense contractor. (Tr. 62, 111.)
7 As of the week ending November 25, 2017, $3,787 had been garnished from his wages in 2017. (AE A,) At
$75 a week, the garnishment would have started before his February 28, 2017 interview.
Collection debt for $3,965 (SOR ¶ 1.c)
A credit card account, opened in December 2010, became delinquent in April 2013.
It was charged off for $3,114 in November 2013, and then placed for collection for $3,841
in June 2015. As of June 2017, the past-due balance was $3,965. (GEs 2, 3.) Applicant’s
spouse testified that neither she nor Applicant can recall opening the account, which was
obtained  in  Applicant’s  name.  They  disputed  the  debt  on  that  basis,  but  they  began
repaying  the  debt.  (GE  4;  Tr.  63.)  As  of  February  2018,  the  account  had  a  past-due
balance of $3,765. (GE 4.)
Charged-off debt for $2,328 (SOR ¶ 1.d)
Applicant opened a credit card account in January 2012 with a home-furnishings
retailer. His account was charged off and closed by the creditor in June 2013 with a past-
due  balance  of  $2,328  after  inactivity  since  May  2013.  (GEs  2-4.)  Applicant’s  spouse
testified that the account has been closed and that the creditor was going to send a 1099-C
(Cancellation of Debt) form to them. (Tr. 63-64.) No 1099-C form was submitted into the
record either during or after the hearing.
Collection debt for $2,244 (SOR ¶ 1.e, possibly the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.j)
In  April  2014,  Applicant’s  credit  card  account  with  a  retailer  was  assigned  for
collection for $2,105 after inactivity since February 2013. In October 2015, the collection
entity (collection agency X) obtained a judgment for $2,104, which appears to be for the
debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.e.8  As  of  June  2017,  collection  agency  X  was  reporting  a  collection
balance of $2,244 on the debt. (GEs 2-3.) As of February 2018, Equifax was reporting a
past-due balance of $2,004 on the account in SOR ¶ 1.e with a date of last payment in
January 2018. (GE 4.)
Collection debt for $1,765 (SOR ¶ 1.f)
In April 2015, a wireless phone service placed a $1,765 balance from May 2013 for
collection. (GE 2.) As of June 2017, the debt had not been paid. (GE 3.) Applicant disputed
his liability (Answer), and the debt was no longer on his credit record as of February 2018.
(GE 4.) Applicant’s spouse testified that her sister applied for wireless phone service in her
name without her knowledge. (Tr. 67-68.) Neither Applicant nor his spouse have filed a
report  with  the  police  of  identity  theft  because  they  have  yet  to  see  the  result  of  their
verification request with the creditor. (Tr. 116.)
Collection debt for $782 (SOR ¶ 1.g)
Applicant  bought  some  merchandise  on  credit  from  a  mail  order  company  in
December 2012. When his account became six months past due in October 2013, it was
placed for collection for $782. (GEs 2-4.) Applicant’s spouse testified that $25 monthly

October 2015.
payments went toward that debt (Tr. 69), although Equifax was not showing any progress
toward resolving that debt as of February 2018. (GE 4.)
Medical collection debt for $296 (SOR ¶ 1.h)
In February 2016, a $296 medical debt from July 2010 was placed for collection.
(GE 2.) Applicant initially disputed the debt, believing that insurance should have covered
it.  He  and  his  spouse  later  learned  that  he  had  incurred  the  debt  during  a  gap  in  his
insurance coverage. (Tr. 69.) Applicant’s spouse testified that the debt has been paid. (Tr.
70.) Applicant provided no documentation in that regard, but the debt was no longer on his
credit report as of June 2017. (GE 3.)
Judgment debt for $7,489 (SOR ¶ 1.k)
In  April  2014,  Applicant’s  credit  card  with  a  home  improvement  retailer  went  to
collections with a balance of $7,490. In July 2015, the collection entity obtained a $7,489
judgment.  (GEs  2-4.)  Available  copies  of  money  orders  show  that  Applicant  paid  a
collection entity $50 on December 14, 2017, and on January 16, 2018. (AE B.)  After a
payment  in  January  2018,  Applicant  owed  a  past-due  balance  of  $7,439.  (GE  4.)
Applicant’s spouse made another $50 payment on February 8, 2018. (AE B.)
Applicant’s spouse testified that she made monthly payments of $25 each on four
delinquent accounts held by a collection law firm. (Tr. 72.) Available money orders show
separate payments of $25 each on three accounts on January 5, 2017, June 14, 2017, July
17, 2017, and August 12, 2017; a $150 payment covering three accounts on October 6,
2017 (apparently covering a missed September payment and the October 2017 payment);
a single $75 payment on November 11, 2017; three $25 payments on December 14, 2017;
and three $25 payments on January 16, 2018. (AE B.) The payments were likely toward
the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.e, given Applicant’s credit report showed a last payment on
those  accounts  in  January  2018,  and  possibly  1.g,  based  on  his spouse’s  testimony.9
Payments toward the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k were to a different collection entity. (AE B.)
Applicant regularly worked overtime for the defense contractor because he had bills
to pay. He had only two days off between October 2016 and January 2018, when he was
walked off the job because of the issuance of the SOR. (Tr. 18, 25, 38.) He was paid time
and a half on Saturdays and double time on Sundays. (Tr. 38.) He received three pay
increases while at the defense contractor, including a raise to a base pay of $21.79 an
hour  just  before  he  lost  his  job.  (Tr.  20-21.)  He  is  subject  to  recall  if  his  clearance  is
adjudicated favorably. (Tr. 25-26.) As of March 2018, Applicant had unemployment income
of $643 a week. (Tr. 26-27.) He had about $800 in his checking account and only $25 in
savings. He has a 401(k) account with $2,000 to $3,000 on deposit. (Tr. 44.) By the time
9 The account and file numbers on the money orders differ from the account numbers on Applicant’s credit
report and are likely the numbers assigned by the collection attorney. The payment amounts indicate three
debts were being repaid on a monthly basis. The payments may pertain to four SOR allegations, however, if
the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.j is a duplicate listing of SOR ¶ 1.e.
the household expenses are paid, he and his spouse have little to nothing left over each
month. (Tr. 45.) Applicant’s spouse has not worked since 2010 or 2011, although she had
social security disability income of $1,700 a month from at least 2013 through 2015.10 (Tr.
76-77, 108.) They need his income to make payments on his past-due debts. (Tr. 85.) His
spouse is looking for work. (Tr. 109.) Neither Applicant nor his spouse has not had any
financial counseling. (Tr. 51, 117.)
Applicant and his spouse have had marital difficulties since 2011 or 2012. She was
unable to explain how Applicant spent his time because they have not seen each other
much since he learned about her drug addiction and gambling. They have not divorced and
continue to live in the same house for the sake of the children since 2011 or 2012, but he
lives on the lower level. (Tr. 107.) She continues to handle the household finances. (Tr. 43,
55.) The older of Applicant’s and his spouse’s two daughters is in college. She apparently
finished high school early and works two part-time jobs while going to school. Their son
and younger daughter live at home. (Tr. 94.) Applicant bought a 2006 model-year vehicle
for $3,000 cash for his son but no other large purchases or vacations in the last three
years. (Tr. 45, 117.) He has opened no new credit card accounts. (GE 4.)
