The  SOR  alleges  27  delinquent  debts  totaling  over  $54,000,  including  debts
placed for collections, and judgments against Applicant. Applicant “agreed” or admitted
15  of  the  alleged  delinquent  debts  in  her  Answer  to  the  SOR,  including  all  of  the
delinquent  student  loans.  (Answer,  Tr.  9).  She  “disagreed”  or  denied  the  six  medical
debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant testified that SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.m were student loan
debts  accrued  from  the  four-year  period  when  she  was  unable  to  work.  (Tr.  22)  Her
daughter  was  born  with  food  allergies  triggering  seizures,  requiring  Applicant  to  stay
home and care for the child. Her first husband was a low-paid teacher. (Tr. 23)
Applicant  testified  that  some  of  her  delinquent  student  loans  were  federal  and
owed  to  the  DOE.  Others  were  state-subsidized  loans  owed  to  the  state  student  loan
agency. (Tr. 23) She claims that her DOE student loans have been rehabilitated and will
be  consolidated  into  one payment  in  June  2018.  (Tr. 24) She  has also  reached  out  to

KHEAA to inquire about rehabilitation programs. She provided a post-hearing letter from
the Department of the Treasury indicating that Applicant’s IRS tax refund was withheld
in  the  amount  of  $2,294  to  apply  to  her  DOE  delinquencies.  (AE  B).  Otherwise,  she
hasn’t paid on her student loans for seven years. (Tr. 26)
Applicant  testified  that  when  she  left  her  husband  in  2016,  she  had  $30  in  her
bank  account  and she  was  earning  very  little. When  she  returned  to  the  work  force in
2012, she was earning $250 every two weeks. (Tr. 25) She was unable to pay her bills.
Now, she earns approximately $46,000 per year, and her new husband earns $20,000
per year. (Tr. 27)
SOR ¶¶ 1.l, 1.o, 1.s, 1.t, and 1.u are delinquent medical debts in connection with
her daughter’s health issues, that were placed for collection. Applicant testified that the
child’s  father  is  supposed  to  pay  for  half  of  these  medical  expenses,  but  he  has  not
done so. (Tr. 29) He does send her $417 each month for child support. (Tr. 30) SOR ¶
1.n is an insurance debt that she contends should have been paid by her ex-husband.
She  claims  she  removed  herself  from  the  insurance  policy  when  they  split.  (Tr.  30)
Similarly,  SOR  ¶  1.f  was  for  cable  television  that  should  be  paid  by  her  ex-husband
since he supposedly kept the cable boxes. (Tr. 32) Applicant “disagrees” with SOR ¶¶
1.q,  1.s,  1.t,  and  1.u,  but  she  has  not  reached  out  to  the  creditors  or  provided  any
evidence of dispute. All of her delinquent debts are listed in her credit reports.
Applicant testified that the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.r is for a bank credit card she
used,  and  she  is  working  on  a  payment  plan.  (Tr.  34)  She  provided  no  documents  to
substantiate her payment plan. Applicant testified that SOR ¶¶ 1.v through 1.z all relate
to delinquent debts or judgment (1.x), which she does not deny owing, but disputes with
her  ex-husband  about  who  owes  this  debt.  (Tr.36-38)  She  plans  to  satisfy  all  of  her
delinquent debts in the future. (Tr. 37) She provided post-hearing documents showing a
payment made on March 28, 2018, in the amount of $149 on her federal student loans,
and another one due on April 19, 2018 (AE A); and another document advising her to
continue her $5 per month payments to the collection agency for DOE, but her payment
plan  expires  June  4,  2018.  (AE  C)  She  also  produced  a  student  loan  rehabilitation
packet  showing  that  due  to  her  increased  annual  salary,  her  DOE  monthly  payments
increased from $25 per month to $232 per month as of May 2018. (AE D)
Applicant’s  financial  issues  started  when  she  was  out  of  the  work  force  for  four
years  caring  for  her  sick  daughter.  Her  problems  worsened  when  she  left  her  ex-
husband and disputed with him many of their jointly held debts in 2016. Before that, she
was  diagnosed  with  a  serious  illness  ten  years  ago.  (Tr.  43)  It  is  now  in  remission.
Applicant has not had debt consolidation services or financial counseling. (Tr. 40) She
does  claim  to  have  a  budget,  but  it  was  not  provided.  Applicant  stated  her  plan  going
forward  is  to  address  the  larger  delinquencies  first  and  resolve  those.  She  has  not
provided documentary evidence of a continuous stream of payments to establish a track
record of repayments on any of her delinquent debts.
