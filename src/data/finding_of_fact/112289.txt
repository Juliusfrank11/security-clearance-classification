Applicant admitted allegations in the SOR ¶ 1.a through ¶ 1.d and denies ¶ 1.e.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 58 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1982 and a master’s
degree in 1991. Applicant has been married three times. His last divorce was in 2013. He
has no children. He served as a commissioned officer on active duty in the Air Force from
1983 until 1995. He served in the Air Force Reserve from 1996 to 2008. He retired from
the  military  in  2008.2  Applicant  has  worked  for  federal  contractors  from  1995  to  the
present.3
In June 2007, Applicant pled not guilty at a General Court-Martial to violations of
the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ).4  He  was  found  guilty  of  all  charges  and
specifications. They were as follows:
1 Administrative Exhibit I includes email correspondence verifying and confirming that Applicant elected to
have his case decided on the written record.
2 There was no evidence as to the characterization of Applicant’s discharge.
3 Item 2.
4 Items 5, 6, 7.
One specification of violation of UCMJ Article 80, attempting to steal United States
currency, military property, of a value of more than $500 from the U.S. Air Force.
Six specifications of violations of UCMJ Article 107, false official statement. Each
specification  alleged  a  different  date  from  April  2,  2005  to  April  17,  2006,  and
different amounts of money claimed for lodging reimbursement on each date. The
six amounts claimed were $4,620; $180; $1,010; $3,060; $120; and $2,040. The
allegations were that Applicant with intent to deceive, signed an official document,
a  travel  voucher,  which  was  false  in  that  his  lodging  cost  was  not  the  amount
claimed, and Applicant knew it was false at the time he signed the voucher.
Four specifications of violations of UCMJ Article 121, larceny. Two specifications
alleged  that  in  May  2005  and  September  2005,  Applicant  stole  United  States
currency, military property, of a value of less than $500, the property of the U.S.
Air Force. Two specifications alleged that in April 2005 and September 2005, he
stole United States currency, military property, of a value of more than $500, the
property of the U.S. Air Force.
Six specifications of violations of UCMJ Article 132, submission of a false claim.
Specifically, the allegations stated that for the purposes of obtaining the approval,
allowance, and payment of a claim against the United States, in different amounts
for  each  specification,  on  six  different  occasions,  Applicant  made  and  used  a
writing, which Applicant knew said writing was false and fraudulent.
Applicant  was  sentenced  to  confinement  for  45  days,  forfeiture  of  $1,000  per
month  for  12  months,  a  fine  of  $7,350,  and  a  reprimand.  He  was  released  from
confinement after 37 days due to good behavior. Applicant held the rank of major (O-4)
at the time of his General Court-Martial. He retired as a captain (O-3).5
The facts surrounding the charges are that Applicant formed a corporation in which
he was the only employee. The corporation purchased a recreational vehicle. During his
reserve  duty,  the  corporation  rented  to  Applicant  the  recreational  vehicle  for  lodging.
Applicant rented a space to park the recreational vehicle on the military base where he
was  serving.  The  space  cost  $15  a  day.  Applicant  submitted  claims  to  the  U.S.
Government for approximately 177 nights of lodging from 2005 to 2006. He claimed he
was  staying  at  the  XX  Apartment  Complex.  The  amount  claimed  was  for  the  cost  of
lodging at XX Apartment Complex. The corporation provided Applicant invoices reflecting
Applicant had paid for lodging at XX Apartment Complex and the amount Applicant had
paid. This was false in that XX Apartment Complex did not exist, and Applicant had not
paid a lodging expense for the amount he claimed for reimbursement by the Air Force.
Applicant submitted these claims for payment. Applicant’s criminal conviction is recorded
in the FBI database.6
5 Items 1, 2, 5, 6, 7; AE A.
6 Items 1, 2, 5, 6, 7.
In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR  and  response  to  the  FORM,  he  disputed  the
Government  prosecution’s  interpretation  of  the  Joint  Federal  Travel  Regulations  and
other aspects of his General Court-Martial.7
In  Applicant’s  October  2015  e-QIP,  he  disclosed  that  he  failed  to  timely  file  his
2012, 2013, and 2014 federal and state income tax returns. Regarding his 2012 returns,
he stated: “Unable to compile and complete documentation due to pending divorce.”8 For
2013, he stated: “Unable to compile and complete documentation due to recent divorce.”9
For 2014, he stated: Unable to compile and complete documentation due to incomplete
tax filings.”10 He provided the same information for any action he had taken regarding his
failing  to  file  his  returns,  stating:  “Withholding  at  single  and  zero  status  should  have
covered all taxes due. Attempting to complete filings in the next two months.”11
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  January  2016.  He
admitted to the investigator that he failed to file his state and federal income tax returns
because  he  was  unable  to  organize  documents  and  paperwork  for  his  taxes.  This
impacted all of his taxes for the following years because he could not file any tax returns
until he filed his 2012 tax returns. He told the investigator he intended to file for a six-
month extension on his 2015 tax returns and would resolve his tax issues by the end of
2016.12
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant said that he filed his 2012 federal and state
tax returns in May 2016. He provided an unsigned federal income tax form and a copy of
a May 2016 check to the United States Treasury in the amount of $1,993. Applicant also
provided signed copies of his 2013, 2014, and 2015 federal and state income tax returns.
They are all dated March 2018. Based on the forms Applicant provided, it shows he was
due refunds for those tax years.13 There was no copy of an extension request to the IRS.
Applicant denied the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e, a mortgage that was in foreclosure status
and was delinquent. In his SOR answer, he indicated he was able to resolve this mortgage
7 Item 1; AE A, B, C, D, and F are documents and arguments by Applicant regarding his dispute with the
finding and  verdict of the  General Court-Martial. Applicant’s answer to the  SOR is in  the form of a brief
signed  by  his  attorney  and  submitted  on  behalf  of  Applicant.  Throughout  the  decision,  comments  are
attributed to Applicant that were provided as part of his answer to the SOR in the brief.

by paying it off. Documents were provided that show the mortgage was paid in 2015.14 It
is resolved.
Applicant admitted the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d, a second mortgage on rental
property he owns. Credit reports from November 2015 and February 2017 show the loan
is  past  due.  A  credit  report  from  April  2018  indicates  the  debt  has  been  charged  off.
Applicant stated in his answer that in his last conversation with the creditor he was told
that  foreclosure  actions  would  be  held  in  abeyance  pending  Applicant’s  sale  of  the
property,  refinancing  it,  or  bringing  the  debt  current.  He  planned  to  pay  the  debt  and
refinance it after he received his tax refund.15
In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he stated:
The  foreclosure  actions  by  the  second  mortgage  holder  were  also
terminated, and the account is in an agreed status that payment-in-full will
be rendered upon any future sale of the property. I acknowledge the debt,
and  I  am  working  to  settle  it  as  soon  as  possible.  I  have  received  no
correspondence  that  indicates  the  agreed  upon  status  has  changed.  I
continue to list the mortgage holder on the current home insurance policy
should any damage or destruction occur to the property.16
Applicant provided a copy of a voluntarily dismissal of a foreclosure complaint from
the  creditor  in  SOR  ¶  1.d  that  was  granted  in  July  2013.  Applicant  did  not  provide
documentary evidence to corroborate the “agreed status” or efforts he has taken to pay
the delinquent debt, refinance the loan, or sell the property. The debt is now reported as
charged  off  in  the  most  current  credit  report.17  Although  the  creditor  is  not  pursuing
foreclosure, evidence was not provided to show the debt is resolved or being resolved.
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  his  last  divorce,  stating  his  wife
accumulated excessive debt, and she failed to act responsibly in addressing it. Applicant
did not recognize there was a problem until his wife stopped working. He also had tenants
that stopped paying, and he was unable to pay the mortgage on his rental property. He
stated when he was separated from his wife, she would not help him file joint tax returns.
His divorce was finalized in November 2013. He then focused on work and lost sight of
many  things.  He  stated  he  would  start  to  work  on  filing  his  tax  returns,  but  something

16 AE A.
17  Item  1;  AE  A.  SOR  ¶  1.d  alleged  the  account  was  placed  in  collection  in  the  approximate  amount  of
$6,752. Items 9 and 10 show the debt past due for the same amount. Item 11, the most recent credit report
shows the charged off amount is $62,735. The last payment made was in February 2012. In Applicant’s e-
QIP (Item 2) he disclosed the debt was delinquent and listed the amount of the financial issue as $62,735,
and not as $6,752.
would  come  up  that  needed  his  immediate  attention.  He  decreased  his  expenses  and
withdrew money from his pension plan. He increased his withholdings for his taxes, so he
would not owe tax when he did file. He saw this as an interest-free loan to the government.
He viewed his late filing as a “ministerial action,” but he concedes, a required one, but it
did not deprive the government of revenue.18
Applicant provided copies of performance evaluations from his employers, awards,
college transcripts, resume, and a personal financial statement, among other documents.
I considered them all, along with his statements and explanations.19
