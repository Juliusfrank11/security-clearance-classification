After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 51-year-old high school graduate who has worked as a field technician
for a defense contractor since December 2016. He and his spouse married in February
2016, and they have a six-year-old son. Applicant’s spouse has an 18-year-old daughter
from a previous relationship. Applicant seeks a security clearance for his current duties. He
held a DOD security clearance some 30 years ago. (GE 1.)
In August 2003, the youngest of Applicant’s three sisters passed away at age 37.
Applicant and his parents became guardians of her four children, who were all under age
18.1 Applicant’s parents took the children into their home. Applicant moved into his parents’
home  to  help  care  for  his  three  nephews  and  a  niece  and  provide  some  financial
assistance. He was allowed by a court order to claim the children as dependents on his
income tax returns. Applicant obtained health insurance coverage for his nephews and
niece,  and  he  went  from  paying  $58  a  month  to  more  than  $300  a  month  for  health
insurance. His food expenditures more than doubled to $400 to $600 a month. Applicant
also helped with other household bills, but his father paid the mortgage on the house. (Tr.
23-26, 53-54.) The record evidence contains no information about Applicant’s income at
that  time.  There  is  also  no  evidence  about  any  financial  assistance  provided  by  the
children’s father.
In November 2005, Applicant began working as a systems administrator at $50,000
a year. (Tr. 37.) In 2006, his father died. Applicant became the primary provider for his ill
mother, his three nephews, and his niece. In addition to the household bills, Applicant
covered some of the cost of his mother’s medications, which, at times, amounted to $800 a
month. (Tr. 24-25.)
Applicant’s mother died in 2009. Applicant’s youngest nephew was age 17 and his
niece was age 15 at the time. The younger of Applicant’s sisters claimed the two children
as dependents on her income tax returns. When Applicant’s parents’ home sold in 2010,
Applicant’s niece went to live with the older of Applicant’s two living sisters. His nephew
turned 18, but Applicant continued to claim three exemptions for income tax withholding
purposes because he needed the extra money. (GE 2; Tr. 26-29, 55-58.)
Applicant did not file his Federal or state X income tax returns when they were due
for tax years 2009 through 2014, even for those years when he believed he overpaid his
taxes. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 41.) He knew he was supposed to file his income tax returns and he
“just didn’t do it.” (Tr. 59.) After Applicant received a notice from state X of tax delinquency
for tax years 2009 to 2012,2 he established a repayment plan to address his state his tax
delinquencies, and he paid $150 a month until April 2016. He believes he has resolved his
state tax liabilities for tax years 2009 through 2011. (GE 2; Tr. 51, 60.) Applicant did not
adjust his tax withholdings until 2015, when he began to claim zero exemptions. (GE 2, Tr.
51, 59.)
1 Applicant testified that, in 2006, his niece was age 10 and his nephews were ages 12, 13, and 15. (Tr. 24.)
However, Applicant discrepantly told an OPM investigator (GE 2) and testified at his hearing (Tr. 25, 55) that
his two older nephews were 19 and 20 years old and his underage niece and nephew were 15 and 17 years
old in 2009.
2 Applicant is reported to have  indicated during his July 2017 interview with an OPM investigator that he
received the state tax delinquency notice in 2012 for tax years 2009 through 2014 [sic]. (GE 2.) His income tax
returns for tax years 2012 through 2014 would not have been due in 2012. It is unclear when he received the
notice of tax delinquency. GE 5 shows that he made some tax payments to state X before July 2017 that were
applied to his tax delinquency for 2012.
Applicant and his spouse planned to marry in 2012, but her mother became ill in
state  Y.  His  spouse  returned  to  state  Y  to  care  for her mother. With  their  son  born  in
November 2012 being raised by his spouse across the country, Applicant began to pay
court-ordered  child  support.  He  told  an  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)
investigator in July 2017 that he paid around $500 a month in child support. (GE 2.) At his
hearing, he recalled that he paid around $800 a month for child support. (GE 2; Tr. 27-28,
76.)
In February 2016, Applicant and his spouse married in state Y. Applicant resigned
from  his  job  in  state  X  in  March  2016  and  moved  to  state  Y  in  April  2016.  He  was
unemployed until July 2016 and supported by his spouse and his savings. He worked as a
contact field technician for the next five months at an income of $4,000 a month before he
obtained a permanent position with his current employer in December 2016. (GE 1; AE D;
Tr. 37.)
Applicant’s spouse handled his income tax returns after their marriage. (Tr. 72.) His
Federal and state X income tax returns for tax year 2015 were submitted electronically on
the  tax  deadline  of  April 18,  2016.  (Tr. 41.)  On  adjusted  gross  income  of  $64,492,  he
overpaid his Federal income taxes by $1,632 (AE A) but owed $1,216 in income taxes to
state X. (AE B.) Applicant testified that his Federal refund was applied to delinquent taxes
for previous tax years. (Tr. 41.)
On  May  1,  2017,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). Applicant responded affirmatively to
an inquiry concerning whether he had failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes
when required in the last seven years. He indicated that he had not yet filed his Federal
and state income tax returns or paid his taxes owed for tax years 2009 through 2014 and
that he owed an estimated $5,000 in back taxes. He explained that there was “really no
reason not to file,” with respect to tax years 2009 through 2013, but that he had submitted
his W-2 forms and would file his delinquent returns for those tax years within 30 days.
Concerning tax year 2014, he explained that he was working with a tax agency to resolve
his  back  taxes  and  get  his  returns  filed.  He  indicated  that  his  sibling  “wrote  off”  his
deceased sister’s children on her taxes without his consent, and that as the children’s legal
guardian, he should have been allowed to claim them as dependents. Applicant related
with respect to tax year 2015 that his tax returns had been filed, but he owed $1,500 to
state X and was working with the state to resolve his tax debt. Under optional comments,
Applicant asserted that he “did start filing and paying taxes again in 2015.” He expressed
his belief that his state taxes had been paid up to tax year 2014. (GE 1.)
In response to an SF 86 inquiry concerning any delinquency involving enforcement,
Applicant listed a judgment estimated at $7,775 [sic] for a defaulted auto loan (SOR ¶ 1.e)
on which he could not afford payments after his son was born. He explained that he had
contacted  the  creditor  recently  to  arrange  for repayment.  Applicant  answered  “Yes” to
whether he had any bills or debts turned over for collection in the last seven years, and he
indicated that he owed $315 for a payday loan (SOR ¶ 1.d), $2,214 for wireless phone
services (SOR ¶ 1.i), and  $149 for cable television service (SOR ¶ 1.f) that he would
repay. He explained that he defaulted on the payday loan and his wireless phone account
because he had to pay child support. He questioned his liability for the cable television debt
claiming  that  he  did  not  open  the  account.  However,  he  also  indicated  that  he  would
contact the creditor to pay the debt in full. (GE 1.) A check of Applicant’s credit on July 7,
2017, revealed that he owed $7,755 on the previously disclosed defaulted auto loan (SOR
¶ 1.e); $315 on the payday loan (SOR ¶ 1.d); $149 for cable television (SOR ¶ 1.f); and
$2,214  for  wireless  phone  services  (SOR  ¶  1.i).  His  cell  phone  account  first  became
delinquent in December 2015 and was considered seriously past due as of January 2017.
His credit report also revealed old collection debts of $668 for natural gas services (SOR ¶
1.g), $416 for utility services (SOR ¶ 1.h), and $114 for insurance when he lived in state X
(SOR ¶ 1.j). (GE 3.)
On July 21, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator for the OPM.  He
admitted that he had not filed his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2009
through 2014.  His tax returns for tax year 2015 were filed, but he owed approximately
$1,500 in state X taxes. After he received a notice from state X indicating that he owed
taxes for several years starting with tax year 2009, he reported making $150 payments
toward his state X income tax debts until he moved in April 2016. Applicant acknowledged
that he had yet to resume his tax payments because all of his tax documents had been
provided  to  a  local  accountant.  He  indicated  that  the  accountant  would  file  all  of  his
delinquent federal and state income tax returns along with his 2016 income tax returns in
August 2017. Applicant stated that he would establish repayment plans for his tax debts.
(GE 2.)
Regarding his listed judgment debt for the defaulted car loan, Applicant explained
that he made timely payments of $584 a month for about a year until November 2012,
when his son was born and his brother passed away. Applicant helped pay for his brother’s
funeral,  and  he  had  an  ongoing  child  support  obligation  for  his  son  until  April  2016.
Applicant  had  the  vehicle  voluntarily  repossessed,  and  it  was  sold  at  auction  in  2013,
leaving  him  responsible  for  a  $7,775  [sic]  deficiency  balance.  On  receiving  notice  in
October  2016  of  a  May  2016  default  judgment,  Applicant  contacted  the  creditor,  who
demanded a lump-sum payment that he could not pay. Applicant explained that he and his
spouse intended to sell her home to repay the debt.3 As for the payday loan, Applicant
obtained  the  loan  in  January  2013  for  food,  gasoline,  and  other  living  expenses.  He
indicated that he contacted the collection entity in January 2017, and indicated that he
would pay off the debt in full. However, he later learned that his spouse had not paid the
debt. He explained that he and his spouse had budgeted to pay off the debt in October
2017. Applicant acknowledged the $2,214 wireless telephone debt, which he maintained
would  be  paid  in  full  in  August  2017.  As  for  the  $149  cable  television  debt,  Applicant
indicated  that  he  closed  the  account  when  he  moved  in  October  2012.  He  had  been
unaware of a balance due before he obtained his credit report in September 2016. He cited
lack of funds as the reason why he had not paid the debt, but his child care expenses
would  be  reduced  in  September  2017  when  his  son  started  school.  Concerning  the
delinquencies not listed on his SF 86, Applicant became aware of the $114 insurance debt
3 As of November 2018, Applicant and her spouse were still residing at the same address, so it does not
appear that his spouse sold her home to help him pay his debts.
when  he  obtained  his  credit  report.  He  indicated  that  he  would  satisfy  the  debt  by
December 2017. Applicant did not deny the $416 utility debt when confronted, which he
assumed was a final bill that he did not receive. As for the $668 natural gas debt, Applicant
was a tenant when he had a gas leak, and he had heard nothing further about the debt
after he contacted his landlord. He indicated that he would work the debt into his budget to
repay it by December 2017. Applicant described his financial situation as “getting better” in
that he and his spouse have been able to pay their current living expenses. He added that
they  would  continue  to  use  a  budget,  live  within  their  means,  and  start savings  for an
emergency fund. (GE 2.)
On July 19, 2017, state X billed Applicant for unpaid income taxes totaling $7,810
for tax years 2012 through 2015 after being credited for $783 in payments applied to his
tax  debt  for  tax  year  2012.  (GE  5.)  On  July  28,  2017,  Applicant  provided  the  OPM
investigator with a copy of the notice. He explained that the payments he made to state X
before April 2016 fully resolved his state X tax debts for tax years 2009, 2010, and 2011.
He expressed an intention to contact state X to establish a payment plan for the taxes
owed for tax years 2012 through 2015 and to file his delinquent Federal and state income
tax returns in August 2017. Applicant related that he contacted the gas company about the
$668 debt and was waiting to hear back about the debt. Applicant had made no effort to
look into the $416 utility debt in collection, but he planned to pay it off by December 2017.
(GE 2.)
Applicant submitted his Federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2016 on
September 29, 2017.4 (AEs C-E.) Applicant asserts that he filed his income tax returns on
time.  (Tr.  42.)  Based  on  adjusted  gross  income  of  $51,515,  Applicant  was  entitled  to
Federal tax refund of $301. (AE C.) He earned $34,158 of his income in state Y, and was
paid a refund of $103. (AE D.) Applicant underpaid his state X income taxes by $133 on
earnings  of  $17,357  in  state  X  for  2016.  He  arranged  for  the  debt  to  be  paid  through
automatic deduction from his bank account. (AE E.)
Applicant  filed  his  Federal  and  state  tax  returns  for  tax  year  2017  before  his
November 2018 hearing. (Tr. 43.) After his hearing, he provided copies of his Federal and
state income tax returns confirming that they had been filed electronically, but his returns
do  not  show  the  filing  date.  Based  on  adjusted  gross  income  of  $95,030,  Applicant
overpaid  his Federal income  taxes  by  $1,985  (AE  F) and his state Y  income taxes by
$1,623. (AE G.) He received a notice from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that he
owed approximately $1,300 for tax year 2010 and assumed that his refund for 2017 would
be seized and applied to his debt for tax year 2010. However, he received his refund for
2017. (Tr. 44, 48.)
As  of  November  2018,  Applicant  had  not  filed  his delinquent  Federal and  state
income tax returns for tax years 2009 through 2014. (Tr. 43.) When asked to explain his
continuing  noncompliance  with  his  legal  obligation  to  file  these  tax  returns,  Applicant
indicated  that  he  had  given  his  documentation  to  a  local  tax  preparer,  but  his  spouse

the deadline to October 16, 2017.
thought it cost too much and that she could handle them. (Tr. 46.) He was told by state X
that  if  he  filed  his  delinquent  state  returns,  he  would  receive  refunds  rather  than  owe
income taxes. (Tr. 45-46.) Applicant now intends to consult a tax attorney for assistance in
filing his delinquent tax returns. (Tr. 47.) Applicant has not made any payments toward his
state X tax debts since moving to state Y in April 2016. (Tr. 52.)
Applicant focused on resolving his largest consumer credit debt. He testified that he
made payments starting in January 2018 to fully satisfy the car loan deficiency in SOR ¶
1.e. (Tr. 52, 62-64.) As of November 5, 2018, Equifax was reporting the account as having
a zero balance after a $1,127 payment made in October 2018. (GE 4.) Applicant had made
no  progress  toward  resolving  the  $315  payday  loan  (SOR  ¶  1.d),  the  $2,214  wireless
phone  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.i),  and  the  $416  utility  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.h).  (GE  4;  Tr. 52,  66-70.)
Applicant owes $169 on a personal services debt placed for collection in the amount of
$489  in  September  2017.  The  delinquent  cable  television  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.f)  and  $114
insurance debt (SOR ¶ 1.j) were no longer on his credit record (GE 4), but there is no
evidence that he made any payments toward them. Applicant acknowledges that he has
not paid the insurance debt. (Tr. 70.) He was making timely payments of $534 monthly on
an automobile loan obtained for $22,837 in December 2016. (GE 4.) He had to purchase a
new car when his truck broke down. (Tr. 52, 65.)
Applicant’s current salary is $72,300 annually. (Tr. 36.) As of November 2018, he
had $230 in combined savings and checking deposits. He has about $3,000 in retirement
assets. (Tr. 70.) His spouse just started a new, full-time job with the state. She is paid $36
an hour. For the past two years, she worked part time, about 20-30 hours a week at $35-
$36 an hour, while attending school. (Tr. 71, 74-75.) Afterschool care for his son is about
$300 a month. (Tr. 66.) He and his spouse had previously paid $700 a month for daycare.
(Tr. 67.)  Applicant believes he is “on track to do a lot better [financially].” (Tr. 72.) He
estimates that after paying his routine bills, he has $500 a month to put toward his debts,
such as his taxes. (Tr. 73.)
