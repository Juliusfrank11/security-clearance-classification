Applicant  is  a  55-year-old  senior  electrical  engineer,  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since 1986. He married in 1987 and separated in July 2015. He shares custody
of two children, 18 and 14 years old. He currently holds a top secret security clearance.
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  is  delinquent  on  seven  consumer  debts  totaling
approximately $30,500; failed to file Federal tax returns for 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017;
and is delinquent on approximately $13,137 in Federal income taxes for tax years 2015
and 2016. The SOR allegations are supported by substantial evidence. In his Answer to
the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations except he disputed the amount owed in SOR
¶ 1.a, and noted that he filed his 2013 and 2014 tax returns, but he had not filed his 2016
and 2017 tax returns as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h.
Applicant separated from his spouse, moved from the house, and filed for divorce
but never completed the process due to attorney costs. He paid about $5,000 in attorney
fees in 2015 and 2016. Marital debts were not divided, but a temporary order was filed in
2015 regarding the parties’ rights and obligations with respect to the children. Applicant
pays child and spouse support totaling about $2,400 per month, and he pays his spouse’s
home utilities and insurance costs. He began to accumulate debts in 2015 and 2016 due
to the costs of separation and divorce proceedings. In 2018, Applicant borrowed about
$40,000 from his 401k retirement plan. The home occupied by his spouse is paid, and he
is renting a home for himself. Applicant disclosed that he is delinquent on debts not listed
in the SOR, and is paying on two auto loans, including his spouse’s car.
Applicant testified that he filed his 2014 and 2015 taxes when due, but did not file
the 2016 or 2017 returns on time because he did not have sufficient income to pay the
taxes  owed.2  When  he  started  to  file  tax  returns  as  a  single  filer,  his  tax  liability
substantially  increased.  After  the  hearing,  Applicant  submitted  a  letter  from  the  IRS
accepting his offer to pay his 2015 and 2016 tax arrearage of $6,053, by December 22,
2018.  However,  at  the  hearing,  Applicant  was  unsure  of  how  he  could  raise  sufficient
funds to pay the tax arrearage. He stated that he has about $1,500 net remainder each
month, but “something always comes up.” He noted he had about $150 in his checking
and savings accounts. No evidence of final satisfaction of the tax debt was provided.
2 Applicant testified  that he  has already  paid about $36,000  in  2018,  to cover taxes owed for 2016  and
2017.  AE  C  shows  IRS  transcripts  showing  payments  of  $24,681  with  Applicant’s  2016  and  2017  tax
returns. The 2016 return was filed in May 2018, and the 2017 return was filed on time in April 2018.
SOR  ¶  1.a  is  a  2017  judgment  owed  to  a  credit  card  company  for  $10,861.
Applicant  agreed  to  a  post-judgment  settlement  to  pay  a  total  of  $5,000  in  monthly
payments beginning in September 2017. At the hearing, Applicant stated that he hired an
attorney to settle the debt and to work on other delinquent debts. Applicant agreed to pay
$416 per month until August 2018, but at the hearing, he stated that he was late in making
payments and was behind about $2,500. No evidence of final satisfaction of the debt has
been provided. Applicant testified that consumer debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b–1.g have
not been resolved, but he intended to ask his attorney to work with the creditors. Post
hearing, Applicant provided a letter from his attorney, indicating that she proposed waiting
for  lawsuits  before  settling  debts,  but  that  she  could  pursue  them  prior  to  litigation  if
Applicant preferred. No evidence of substantial progress toward resolution of the debts
has been provided.
Applicant  described  himself  as  a  mentor  at  his  employment  who  started  new
initiatives. Applicant has not sought financial counseling.
Law and Policies
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484  U.S.  518, 528  (1988). As  Commander in  Chief,  the President  has  the  authority  to
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is  clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An
administrative  judge  must  consider  a  person’s  stability,  trustworthiness,  reliability,
discretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG ¶ 1(b).
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the
possible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant
has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the  President  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  have
established for issuing a clearance.
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the
personal or professional history  of  the applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant from
being  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information.  The  Government  has  the  burden  of
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. “Substantial
evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. Washington
Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a
nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the  criteria  listed
therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3
(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015).
Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG ¶ 1(d).
