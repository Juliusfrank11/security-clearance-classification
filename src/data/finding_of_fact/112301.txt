Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. He denied the allegation
in SOR ¶ 2.a. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  51  years  old.  He  earned  an  associate’s  degree  in  1988.  He  was
married  and  divorced  twice  from  1997  to  2003.  There  were  no  children  from  the
marriages. He remarried in 2012 and has children, ages five years old and 21 months.
He has worked for the same federal contractor since 1988.3
Applicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2007 through
2016 and owed past-due federal income taxes.4
Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in February 2015. He
disclosed that he failed to timely file his 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 federal income
tax returns. He stated: “I am currently working to file federal taxes for 2007.”5 He repeated
this statement for each of the tax years he disclosed and stated he estimated owing $500
for each year. He did not disclose he failed to timely file federal income tax returns for

2012, 2013 and 2014. He testified he could not recall why he failed to disclose the other
tax years. At that time his 2015 federal income tax return was not yet due.6
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  November  2015.  He
disclosed  that  in  September  2015  he  filed  his  2007  through  2011  federal  income  tax
returns. He explained that these tax returns were not timely filed because he was lazy
and did not realize he owed money. He was unaware at that time of the total amount he
owed,  but  stated  that  he  would  possibly  set  up  a  payment  plan.  He  initially  hired  a
professional tax consultant firm to help him, but it went bankrupt.7
Applicant testified that he mailed his 2007, 2008, and 2009 federal tax returns in
2015 and he never heard back from the IRS and the returns were not processed. He said
he called the IRS frequently to find out the returns’ status. 8
Applicant  completed  government  interrogatories.9  In  response  to  inquiries,  he
explained that he failed to file his 2007 through 2011 federal income tax returns. He said
he did not realize at the time that he owed taxes. He stated: “There is not a real reason
for not filing other then I had been burning myself in my work.”10 He stated he had met
with the IRS in December 2016 about negotiating a payment plan or settlement. There
was an error in his 2007 return so he was told it needed to be corrected and resubmitted.
He explained his plan was to hire a tax attorney to complete his taxes, resubmit his 2007
return and negotiate a settlement. He provided the first page of his 2008, 2009 and 2010
IRS  1040  forms  that  only  included  his  income  and  no  other  information.  They  were
stamped by the IRS on December 13, 2016.11
Applicant  completed  additional  government  interrogatories  in  April  2018.  He
explained he submitted tax documents to the IRS three weeks prior to his government
interview, but the IRS had not received his submission. He resubmitted tax documents in
person at an IRS office. He said all of his tax documents were accepted except for tax
year 2007 because it was missing a document. He resubmitted it, and he said his 2007
tax return was being processed to determine his tax liability. Applicant provided the first

disqualifying  purposes.  I  may  consider  such  information  when  making  a  credibility  determination,  in  the
application of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis.

However, in his narrative response he provided dates he made contact with the IRS as December 2016,
which would have occurred after the date he signed his interrogatories.

page of his 2007 IRS 1040 that was stamped on January 24, 2016. The second page
shows that it was prepared on January 19, 2018, by a tax preparer.12
IRS  transcripts  confirmed  that  Applicant  submitted  a  2007  IRS  1040  form  in
January 2016, and it was filed in January 2018. Substitute tax returns were prepared by
the IRS for tax year 2008 in May 2010 and for tax year 2009 in August 2011. Applicant
submitted his federal income tax returns to the IRS for tax year 2010 in December 2016;
tax  years  2011,  2012,  2013,  2014,  2015,  and  2016  were  all  filed  in  January  2018.
Applicant’s annual income for tax years 2008 to 2016 ranged from $98,000 to $130,000.
He was not married in 2007 through 2011.13
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  dedicated  to  his  work  and  did  not  practice  due
diligence in timely completing his federal income tax returns. He said he had been working
with a professional tax consultant firm in 2012, but it went bankrupt. He said after that he
was  missing  documents.  He  understood  he  had  a  duty  to  file  his  tax  returns.  He  kept
getting busy and delayed filing his tax returns. He said he was unable to retrieve from the
IRS tax transcripts for 2007 and 2008, because they were too old. He said the reason he
failed to timely file his 2011 through 2016 federal tax returns was because he was trying
to get a tax number for his wife. He was told by the IRS that he was due refunds for certain
tax years, and he should wait for all of the delinquent years to be processed. Applicant
testified that refunds he was entitled to for tax years 2012 through 2016, were applied to
the federal income taxes he owed for tax years 2006, 2007, and 2008. In May 2018, he
withdrew  money  from  his  pension  plan,  paid  the  penalty,  and  paid  the  federal  income
taxes he owed for tax years 2009, 2010 and 2011. Applicant provided an IRS document
that shows he has a zero balance as of January 2019.14
Applicant was asked if he had timely filed his 2017 federal income tax return, which
was due on April 15, 2018. He did not. He stated he filed it about three weeks before his
hearing.  He did not file  an  extension.  He  did  not  have  an explanation for  his failure to
timely file his 2017 federal income tax return. He stated “It was a credit, I didn’t owe”. He
testified that he promised he would file his tax returns on time in the future.15
Applicant’s mother-in-law was born in the Philippines. She became a permanent
resident  of  the  United  States  in  September  2015.  She  was  sponsored  by  Applicant’s
wife’s  sister  and  her  husband,  who  are  U.S.  citizens.  Applicant’s  mother-in-law  has
returned  to  the  Philippines  for  several  months  since  acquiring  her  permanent  resident
status, but has not returned there since 2017. She works as a child care provider and is
