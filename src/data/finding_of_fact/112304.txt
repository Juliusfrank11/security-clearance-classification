After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 60 years old and a high school graduate. He has worked for his current
employer,  a  defense  contractor,  since  March  2008.  He  has  been  at  his  present  duty

location since September 2011 and provides program management support. He previously
worked  for  another  defense  contractor  from  1983  to  February  2008  and  has  held  a
clearance since September 1983. He was granted sensitive compartmented information
(SCI) eligibility in 2003. (GEs 1, 2; Tr. 29-30.) He currently holds a secret clearance. (Tr.
36.)
Applicant and his spouse married in January 1985. They have one child, a son now
age 33. Applicant has a 35-year-old daughter from a previous relationship while his spouse
has a 39-year-old daughter from her previous marriage. (GE 1; Tr. 34.) Applicant’s spouse
worked  during  their  marriage  until 2002,  when  Applicant became legal guardian to his
grandson, then an infant. (Tr. 34-35.) Applicant’s spouse manages the finances in their
household. (Tr. 58.)
In September 2004, Applicant purchased a new home for his family. (GEs 1-2.) He
obtained a 30-year mortgage for $219,900, to be repaid at $1,831 per month. Within a year
or so, Applicant opened a secured line of credit (SOR ¶ 1.a) to finish the basement.2 (GEs
3-4;  Tr.  22,  50.)  Over  the  course  of  the  next  five  years,  he  borrowed  approximately
$32,000. (Tr. 51, 68.)
Applicant and his spouse’s son was wounded while serving in Iraq in September
2007. He was medically evacuated to a hospital in Europe before returning to his home in
another state. In February 2008, Applicant and his spouse relocated to their son’s area to
help him with his recovery. In March 2008, Applicant began working as a contractor for his
present employer on a U.S. military base at $83,000 a year, about $2,000 less than his
previous salary. His household expenses increased significantly. He and his spouse rented
a house at $1,200 a month in their new area while continuing to pay the mortgage on their
previous residence, which was occupied by Applicant’s daughter and her two children.
Applicant’s daughter, who was a waitress, contributed “roughly $800” a month, about half
of the monthly mortgage payment on the home. (Tr. 20-21, 30-32.) Applicant’s spouse
made the mortgage payments on time through July 2009. Applicant’s loan was past due 30
days  when  it  was  transferred  shortly  thereafter  to  a  new  loan  servicer.  The  new  loan
servicer failed to withdraw the mortgage payment from their bank account, and their loan
was  placed  into  a  government  program,  which  increased  the  balance  of  the  loan  to
$231,520. (GEs 3-4; Tr. 22.)
In  May  2011,  Applicant’s  daughter  vacated  Applicant’s  house,  and  Applicant’s
spouse  and  grandson  returned  home  in  June  2011.  (Tr.  32-33.)  As  of  August  2011,
Applicant and his spouse had an open line of credit for $5,000 (SOR ¶ 1.b) as overdraft
protection  for  the  home-equity  line  of  credit  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.  Monthly  payments  on  the
account were $143. (GE 3.) After a job opportunity at the same salary surfaced for his
employer in his current location, Applicant moved back home in September 2011. (Tr. 32-
33.)
2 Applicant testified that he obtained a home-equity line of credit in 2005 with a small community bank, and it
was later transferred to the bank identified in SOR ¶ 1.a. (Tr. 50.) Available credit reports show an opening
date of August 2007 with the bank listed in SOR ¶ 1.a. (GEs 3-4.)
In August 2013, Applicant’s spouse was diagnosed with cancer and began incurring
medical bills that strained their finances. (Tr. 33-34.) While Applicant had health insurance,
he had a $9,000 deductible to cover any medical copayments. (Tr. 39-40.) Over the next
two  years,  Applicant  and  his  spouse  paid  $11,000  to  $12,000  toward  her  medical
expenses.  He  also  lost  income  because  he  was  unable  to  travel  during  his  spouse’s
treatments. (Tr. 40.)
After November 2013, Applicant and his spouse stopped paying on the home-equity
loan in SOR ¶ 1.a. When they were billed for two months of payments (approximately
$886), Applicant contacted the bank holding the debt and was informed that the loan had
been converted to a 30-year second mortgage and that he was in default. He had paid on
the secured line of credit for several years and disputed the terms claimed by the bank.
Over  the  next  five  months,  the  balance  continued  to  accrue  because  of  nonpayment.
Applicant  assumed  he  was  a  victim  of  predatory  lending.  Applicant  learned  that  the
conversion to a 30-year loan was in the terms of his original contract. Not knowing how to
proceed and unable to pay the full balance of the debt, Applicant contacted the bank. On
its advice, he applied for a 30-year mortgage to address the delinquent secured line of
credit, only to be denied. When he indicated that he could not pay the full balance, he was
told that a lien would be placed against his home. In February 2015, the bank charged off
the account for $37,193 and placed a lien on his home. (GEs 3-4; Tr. 23, 52-56.)
In  March  2014,  Applicant  and  his  spouse  stopped  paying  on  the  line  of  credit
obtained in July 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.b) that was held by the same bank as the secured home-
equity loan. In October 2014, the bank charged off a balance of $4,482. (GEs 3-4.)
Applicant missed one payment on his primary mortgage because of a lack of funds.
He then made regular payments on his mortgage, but his account was chronically 30 days
past due in 2014 and 2015 because he could not afford to make a double payment. (GEs
2-4.)
In July 2015, Applicant leased a 2015 model-year truck, taking on an $18,991 debt
to be repaid at $486 per month. In December 2015, he obtained a $12,795 car loan for a
2011 model-year small sport utility vehicle for his spouse. Monthly payments on the loan
are $248. (GEs 3-4; Tr. 59, 65-66.)
On  February  24,  2016,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire  for  National  Positions  (SF  86).  In  response  to  financial  record  inquiries
concerning any delinquency involving routine accounts, Applicant indicated that he owed
$35,000 in credit card and second mortgage debt because of medical bills. (GE 1.)
A  check  of  Applicant’s  credit  on  April  12,  2016,  showed  that,  in  addition  to  the
charged-off  balances  of  $37,193  (SOR  ¶  1.a) and  $4,482  (SOR  ¶  1.b) on the lines of
credit, medical debts of $150 from June 2014 (SOR ¶1.e), $150 from March 2015 (SOR ¶
1.f), and $119 from April 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.g) were in collection. Applicant or his spouse was
making payments on a closed credit card account with a $1,780 balance, on the auto lease
with a $15,096 balance and loan with a $12,590 balance, and on open credit card accounts
with balances of $5,250 and $142. (GE 3.) A more recent credit report of November 27,
2017, revealed that a $786 consumer credit debt was placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.c) in
November 2015. As of April 2017, a cellphone debt of $262 from September 2016 was in
collection  (SOR  ¶  1.d).  A  credit  card  opened  in  November  2003  with  Applicant  as  an
authorized user was charged off for $1,827 in 2013 (not alleged). (GE 4.)
In May 2017, Applicant had a medical issue that required his hospitalization for a
month. He was out of work until August 2017, and his short-term disability income was
60% of his regular income. (Tr. 26-27.) Applicant incurred approximately $10,000 in out-of-
pocket medical expenses in addition to the income loss for being unable to travel for work.
(Tr. 41.)
On August 16, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He acknowledged that he could owe as much as
$40,000 on the secured line of credit, which he actively disputed until 2015 on the basis
that it was a ten-year loan, not the 30-year loan claimed by the bank. He had not received
any correspondence about the account since 2015 and had not paid anything toward the
debt.  He  expressed  an  intention  to  make  payments  on  the  account  if  he  receives
information  on  the  account.  Applicant  volunteered  that  he  missed  two  payments  on  a
MasterCard  account  that  was  charged  off  for  approximately  $700  and  could  be  in
collections. He did not know the current status of the account but would pay it if contacted
by  the  creditor.  When  confronted  with  other  adverse  credit  information  on  his  record,
Applicant indicated about the medical collection debt on his record that he could have
overlooked some medical bills from his spouse’s cancer treatments, but he did not recall
any specifics. When asked about his late payments on his primary mortgage, Applicant
related that after he missed one payment, he was always one month behind because he
could not make a double payment. However, he indicated that he brought the loan current
in 2017. Applicant did not recognize the $1,827 delinquency on his credit record. As for the
$4,482 charged-off credit line, Applicant explained that it was for overdraft protection of the
secured line of credit account, and that it was charged off. Applicant related that his current
financial status was positive, and he did not anticipate any future financial issues. (GE 2.)
As of September 2017, Applicant was one month behind on his $1,711 monthly
payment of his primary mortgage. (GE 4.) He fell behind last year because of his loss of
income, registration costs for both vehicles, and the expense of having to put new tires and
brakes on his truck. He has been consistently one month behind since then. (Tr. 60.)  A
credit card account with a current balance of $252 had been delinquent as recently as
June  2017.  Applicant  was  making  timely  payments  for  his  and  his  spouse’s  car  loan
balances of $9,455 and $5,843. He was also making timely payments on his credit card
with a home improvement retailer, which had a balance of $4,339. (GE 4.)
As of May 2018, Applicant had made no payments on the charged-off line of credit
(SOR  ¶  1.a)  or  its  overdraft  protection  account  (SOR  ¶  1.b),  which  were  closed  with
reported outstanding balances of $37,193 and $4,482. (AE C.) He testified that he intends
to repay those debts when he sells his home and that he has no choice in that regard. (Tr.
23-24, 56.) Applicant testified that he received a 1099 form from the bank in 2017, but he
“could not trace it” because the amount does not correspond to information that he has
about the account. (Tr. 57-58.)  He reported the amount as income on his tax return and
incurred a federal tax underpayment of $1,100. He was expecting a state tax refund of
$1,300 that he planned to use to satisfy his federal tax liability. (Tr. 61.) As for consumer
credit  card  accounts,  Applicant  stated  that  five  collection  entities  are  currently  taking
between $40 and $60 a month from his checking account.3  (Tr. 24, 44.) Applicant believed
that one of his debts (SOR ¶ 1.c) was being actively collected at $37 a month. After he
received the SOR, he contacted the creditor holding the debt and made a payment in late
January 2018, which reduced the balance to $742. (AE B; Tr. 43.) He did not realize until
May 2018 that he failed to authorize recurring payment. He corrected the issue to repay the
debt  at  $37  a  month  from  May  2018  through  December  2019.  (AEs  A,  D.)  Applicant
believes that the medical accounts and the wireless phone debt are paid “as noted by the
absence of these accounts in the collections section” on his credit report. He testified that,
in November 2017, he made repayment arrangements with an entity now collecting the
wireless phone debt, and that he is repaying the debt at $60 a month from his account with
a credit union. (Tr. 46-47.) Information from Credit Karma indicates the wireless phone
collection account (SOR ¶ 1.d) has been closed with an outstanding balance of $200 as of
late  May  2018.  (AE  C.)  There  is  no  documentation  confirming  payments  toward  the
medical collection debts, although Applicant stated that he began making $40 monthly
payments toward the debts after he received the SOR. (Tr. 48.) With regard to the timing of
his debt repayments, Applicant stated:
I  didn’t  have  any  more  money  available.  I  realized  the  importance  of  the
impact of some of these bills. I wasn’t ignoring them. I was paying other bills.
I  didn’t  want  anything  else  to  get  onto  the  credit  report.  I  decided  to  pay
them. (Tr. 49.)
Applicant testified to his belief that the $119 medical collection debt (SOR 1.g) has
been paid (Tr. 49), although he provided no corroborating documentation. Since January
2018, he and his spouse have less than $100 in discretionary income each month. (Tr. 58.)
He had $2,500 to $3,000 in his checking account as of mid-May 2018 because he had just
been paid. (Tr. 62.)
Applicant and his spouse have been raising his grandson (age 15 as of May 2018)
since  infancy.  Applicant  has  expenses  for  his  grandson’s  driving  school,  competitive
archery training, and high school activities, in addition to necessities such as food and
clothing. Applicant’s spouse is currently unemployed and has not worked since 2002. (Tr.
25, 34.) She finished her cancer treatment in 2016. (Tr. 26.) Applicant’s current salary is
$93,000 a year. (Tr. 37.) Since 2014 or 2015, he has had retirement income of $1,300 a
month from his previous job. He applied for the disbursement when his spouse was under
medical  treatment.  (Tr.  63.)  He  has  accumulated  $7,000  in  a  401(k)  with  his  current
employer. Applicant’s spouse has $12,000 in a retirement account. (Tr. 64.) Before his own
medical  problem  in  May  2017,  he  traveled  for  work  and  had  per  diem  income  that
augmented his salary by $10,000 a year on average. Applicant expects to resume traveling

for work in the near future. (Tr. 37-39.) He described his financial situation as “the worst it’s
been in 30 years, but it’s getting better.” (Tr. 64-65.)
