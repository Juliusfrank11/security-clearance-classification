The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of January 16, 2018, Applicant was
past due $14,588 on a mortgage in foreclosure status with a $109,401 balance (SOR ¶
1.a),  and  that  he  owed  charged-off  credit  card  balances  of  $11,984  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  and
$8,070 (SOR ¶ 1.c). When he responded to the SOR in March 2018, Applicant admitted
the debts, which he attributed to loss of a job and an economic downturn in the information
technology sector in his previous locale, which made it difficult for him to find a job at an
income  needed  to  cover  all  his  financial  obligations.  He  indicated  that  the  mortgage
delinquency was settled without a final judgment of foreclosure. Applicant explained that he
had no success in negotiating a settlement of the credit card debts. After considering the
pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  46-year-old  information  technology  network  engineer.  He  has  a
bachelor’s degree in computer science awarded in June 1996, and a master’s degree in
business administration awarded in December 2000. He began working for his current
employer, a defense contractor, in September 2016. (GEs 1-2.)
Applicant and his ex-wife married in March 1998 and purchased a home. They had
a  daughter  in  2001.  In  April 2004,  they  moved  to  a  new  locale.  They  bought  a  home,
obtaining a mortgage loan for $60,000. They began having marital difficulties, and decided
to separate in 2006. (GE 1; Tr. 40-41.) They sold their marital home for approximately what
they owed on the mortgage. They also sold a parcel of land to settle some debts. In August
2006, Applicant’s ex-wife purchased a home for herself and their daughter. She paid for
the home in part with an $88,400 mortgage loan on which Applicant was also liable. The
mortgage  payments  were  $768  a  month.  Applicant  resided  with  his  ex-wife  and  his
daughter until February 2007, when he purchased a residence for himself with a mortgage
loan of $101,200, on which his ex-wife was also liable (SOR ¶ 1.a). His mortgage loan
payments were approximately $916 monthly. They jointly obtained a $25,300 home-equity
loan, to be repaid at $103 monthly. Applicant was employed as an information technology
manager at the time. (Answer; GEs 1-5; AE F; Tr. 40-42, 45-46.)
Applicant and his ex-wife were able to maintain the mortgage payments on their
respective residences for a few years. In March 2009, Applicant left his job of six years
after  his  employer  hired  someone  else  to  maintain  a  program  that  Applicant  had
upgraded.1  Applicant started his own computer business, but his self-employment income
was not sufficient to cover all of his bills. He relied on credit cards, retirement savings, and
financial assistance from his father, to pay his living expenses, mortgage, and car payment.
He obtained a car loan of $13,982 in July 2007 that he repaid at $277 a month until it was
fully satisfied in January 2012. (Answer; GEs 1-2; Tr. 42, 47.)
In July 2012, Applicant and his ex-wife became delinquent on the mortgage loan
(SOR ¶ 1.a) and on the home-equity loan for his then residence. Applicant consulted with a
realtor  in  late  September 2012  for help  with  the  paperwork “to  get  out  from  under the
house.” Applicant moved out of the house in November 2012 (Tr. 47-48) and prepared
paperwork to deed the property in lieu of foreclosure, which the lender rejected in April
2013. (AE E.) The lender wanted to do a short sale, but rejected an offer of $50,000 for the
property. (Tr. 43.) When the mortgage account became past due for $14,588, the lender
initiated foreclosure proceedings. (GEs 1-5.)
In  February  2013,  Applicant  obtained  part-time  employment  with  a  home-
improvement retailer. (GE 1; Tr. 43.) His credit-card account in SOR ¶ 1.b was closed in
March 2013 for nonpayment since December 19, 2012. A credit line obtained in February
2008 (SOR ¶ 1.c) was likewise closed in March 2013 for nonpayment after December 19,
2012. As of August 2016, the balances of the charged-off accounts were $11,984 (SOR ¶
1.b)  and  $8,070  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  Another  credit-card  account,  which  had  a  credit  limit  of
$7,200 but a high credit of $12,369, was placed for collection after no payments were
made  after  February  2013.  Applicant  settled  the  debt  for  less  than  its  full  balance  by
January 2014. (GE 3.)
With his divorce not yet finalized, Applicant relocated to his present area in August
2013 for a full-time position with the home-improvement retailer. He took on a second job
with another retailer for a short time, and was able to pay his bills but not get ahead. (GE 1;
AE E; Tr. 43-44.) On October 10, 2013, the lender released the mortgage on his previous
residence, and on October 31, 2013, issued a 1099-A Form, Acquisition of Abandonment
1 Applicant indicated on his August 2016 security clearance application that he left his job for “health reasons.”
(GE 1.) When he responded to the SOR, he indicated that he lost his job after the employer hired someone at
a much lower salary to maintain the system Applicant upgraded. (Answer.) He provided no documentation
showing that he was laid off.
of Secured Property.2 At the time, Applicant and his ex-wife owed a principal balance of
$91,282 on their mortgage loan, and the property was valued at $105,570. (AE F; 42-44,
48.) Applicant’s understanding was that he and his ex-wife no longer had any obligation on
the loan or on the home-equity loan. (Tr. 49.)
Applicant’s gross income for tax purposes was $31,005 in 2014, $30,696 in 2015,
and $21,609 in 2016. (AE B.) He collected worker’s compensation in 2016 after injuring his
knee on the job, which was not taxable. (Tr. 44-45.)
On  August  2,  2016,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) to work for his current employer. In
response to the delinquency involving routine accounts, Applicant listed the delinquent
mortgage, which he indicated was resolved in October 2013 through return of the property.
He  also  listed  the  defaulted  home-equity  line  of  credit  as  resolved  in  October  2013.
Applicant listed the charged-off credit card for $11,984 (SOR ¶ 1.b), and indicated that he
had not taken any actions to resolve it because of a lack of income. He disclosed the
defaulted credit account for $8,070 (SOR ¶ 1.c), but stated in part: “Checking—I received a
‘gains’ tax form for a write off but still shows on credit report—will need to call and correct
them showing that I owe money.” (GE 1.) In September 2016, Applicant began working for
his current employer at an annual salary of $80,000. (Tr. 57.)
On September 28, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant explained that he signed over the
deed  in  lieu  of  foreclosure  to  resolve the defaulted mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.a) and related
home-equity  loans  on  the  property.  He  indicated  that  he  could  not  maintain  the  loan
payments because of low-paying jobs and insufficient income while self-employed. He
asserted that he was still in negotiations with his creditors to settle his $11,984 and $8,020
credit-card delinquencies. He had settled a $12,369 credit-card collection debt for $2,000.
Applicant volunteered that he began working part time for the home-improvement retailer in
early September 2017 in addition to maintaining his full-time job with a defense contractor.3
(GE 2.)
2 As the borrower, Applicant was instructed on the 1099-A that if he abandoned the property, he may have
income from the discharge of indebtedness in the amount of the unpaid balance of his cancelled debt. (AE F.)
The market value of the property as of October 2013 exceeded the principal loan balance by $14,288.34, but
Applicant and his ex-wife were $14,588 past-due on the loan at the time it was released. There is no evidence
that the lender has pursued Applicant for any deficiency, even though the debt was still on his credit record as
of March 2018. (GE 5.) For tax purposes, abandonment is treated differently from foreclosure. Generally,
abandonment is not treated as a sale or exchange of the property while a foreclosure is treated as a sale or
exchange. If the amount realized from an abandonment is more than an individual’s adjusted basis, it amounts
to a gain, if less, then it is a loss. See IRS Publication 544.  If property is abandoned that secures a debt for
which one is personally liable (recourse debt) and the debt is cancelled, the individual realizes ordinary income
equal to the canceled debt. That income must be reported on an individual’s tax return unless one of the
exceptions or exclusions applies. See IRS Publication 4681. There is no evidence that the mortgage holder
issued a 1099-C cancelling the debt. As to whether Applicant reported release of responsibility for the debt as
income on his tax returns for 2013, Applicant testified that an accountant handled his and his then wife’s
income tax returns, which were filed separately. He indicated that he did not receive a copy of his return and
could provide no information in that regard. (Tr. 62-63.)
3Applicant testified at his September 2018 hearing that he has held the part-time job for four or five months.
In  November  2017,  Equifax  reported  the  delinquent  mortgage  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  as
$14,588 past due as of November 2014. The defaulted credit cards (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c)
were reported as unpaid charge-offs. (GE 4.) In January 2018, the DOD CAF issued an
SOR to Applicant because of the mortgage and two credit-card delinquencies. In response
to the SOR, Applicant indicated that the mortgage was settled without a foreclosure, but
that he had been unable “to get any recourse” regarding the credit-card debts. (Answer.)
As of March 2018, the mortgage was on his credit record as a “foreclosure” and past due
for $14,588. No payments had been made toward the $11,984 and $8,070 charged-off
credit delinquencies. Applicant was making payments on terms acceptable to his creditor
on a credit card with a $1,000 limit opened in January 2017. (GE 5.) The card is self-
funded in that Applicant deposits $1,000 and can charge against his balance. (Tr. 58.)
Applicant  purchased  a  legal  plan  through  his  part-time  job  with  the  home-
improvement  retailer,  and  in  approximately  July  2018,  he  consulted  with  an  attorney,
primarily about routine legal services. (Tr. 54.) Applicant advised the attorney that he had
two old credit-card accounts that he last used six years ago and were closed in 2013. The
attorney advised him to look into the applicable state statute of limitations regarding debt
collection. According to Applicant, the attorney stated that if it was close to the date barring
legal collection, he would suggest “just let it ride.” (Tr. 29-30.) Applicant already knew that
the state in which he incurred his credit debts has a three-year statute of limitations for
credit-card debts. (Tr. 56.) He learned that the state has a five-year statute of limitations on
written contracts, and that the state in which he has resided since August 2013 was more
favorable to creditors in that it has a six-year statute of limitations for all financial contracts.
(AEs D, G; Tr. 56.) Applicant considered the credit-card delinquencies “off the books and
off [his] plate.” Thinking he had a slim chance of obtaining the security clearance needed to
keep his job, he made no effort to resolve his delinquent debts as of September 2018. (AE
D; Tr. 49-50, 56.)
Applicant’s current annual income from his defense-contractor job is approximately
$80,105. (Tr. 44-45, 51, 57.) He had $3,635 in combined checking account deposits as of
September 2018, but his rent check had not yet cleared. (Tr. 26.) He had $13,272 in his
savings  accounts.  (AE  C.)  Applicant  has  been  building  his  savings  for  emergency
expenses  because  of  his  difficulty  getting  consumer  credit.  (Tr.  51-52.)  He  averaged
$2,195 in monthly bill expenses from April 2018 to September 2018, which included rent at
$1,435  per  month  but  excluded  food,  personal  care  items,  and  other  miscellaneous
expenses. (AE B.) Applicant pays $100 in child support per month and has his daughter on
his health insurance. (Tr. 52.) Applicant recently purchased a motorcycle for $700 cash that
he uses on occasion to keep down the mileage on his 2007 model-year vehicle, which has
160,000 miles on the engine. (Tr. 53.)
At his hearing, Applicant admitted that he did not want to reach out to his creditors to
resolve the credit-card delinquencies because it would “restart the time clock” on the debts
if  he  was  going  to  be  denied  security  clearance  eligibility  because  of  the  defaulted
mortgage. (Tr. 30.) He expressed a willingness to contact his creditors and attempt good-
(Tr. 57.) He discrepantly gave a start date of September 9, 2017, for his part-time employment during his
subject interview in late September 2017. (GE 2.) The discrepancy was not clarified.
faith  settlements.  I  held  the  record  open  for  over  two  months  for  Applicant  to  present
evidence of settlement efforts. Applicant presented a letter from his attorney who rendered
his professional opinion that Applicant’s debts are no longer legally collectible because the
laws of the state where the debts were incurred are likely controlling, and it has been more
than three years since  Applicant’s last payment on the credit accounts. Regarding the
defaulted mortgage, the attorney indicated that the five-year statute of limitations for written
contracts has expired because Applicant defaulted on the loan before the October 31,
2013 date of abandonment of the property. (AE G.) The attorney billed Applicant $1,091 for
his services providing advice and his legal opinion on the debt matters. (AE I.)
On November 8, 2018, Applicant explained that he would have resolved his past-
due credit-card debts two years ago if he had not been told by a co-worker that he would
be  disqualified  from  having  a  security  clearance  granted  if  he  had  a  bankruptcy  or  a
foreclosure on his record. Applicant requested that he be granted three months to address
his  credit  issues,  and  that,  if  he  fails  to  do  so,  Department  Counsel  could  appeal  a
favorable grant. (AE H.) I held the record open to November 26, 2018, for proof of any
efforts to resolve the SOR debts. On November 26, 2018, Applicant responded that he
used the time to contact his creditors, but he had not been able to resolve the issues. He
admitted that he is “conflicted” about resolving the debts because they are so close to
dropping from his credit record, but that to get a clearance and work the issue in a short
time as a requirement for continued employment would be the only option to “accept the
punishment of having 7 more years of bad debt.” (AE I.)
Applicant  provides  engineering support for a U.S. military program on a military
base.  The  program  manager  has  been  able  to  rely  on  him  “to  be  polite,  inquisitive,
professional and a team player in any area of [their] work.” Applicant has been “punctual,
dedicated and passionate about his work.” (AE A.)
Applicant also provided character reference letters from personal associates and
friends.  Applicant  has  been  active  in  his  church.  He  has  demonstrated  honesty  and
reliability  in  his  dealings  with  his  pastor.  A  longtime  friend  also  attested  to  Applicant’s
trustworthiness. A former co-worker and small business partner indicated that Applicant
has always upheld the strictest of moral standards. Applicant was described as “efficient,
detail-oriented, and extremely competent” by a former colleague. They met in 1999 while
performing contract work for a defense contractor. Applicant has been “a go-to resource”
for  him  on  more  than  one  occasion  when  he  needed  help  on  projects.  He  has  known
Applicant  to  “lead  by  example  when  it  came  to  ensuring  the  safety  and  security  of
information and people both professionally and personally.” (AE A.)
