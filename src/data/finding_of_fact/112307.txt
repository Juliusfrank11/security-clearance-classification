Applicant is a 53-year-old administrative assistant and consultant. Married for the
third time, she is the mother of four adult children and two adult stepchildren. At issue are
16  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $80,000,  as  gleaned  from  her  security  clearance
application  (SCA)  and  credit  reports  submitted  as  Items  4  and  6  of  the  FORM.  The
1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry
(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective
within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017.
overwhelming majority of these debts, about $68,558, consist of federal and state taxes
owed  (SOR  allegations  1.c-1.f)  Applicant  cites  the  origin  of  many  of  these  delinquent
debts to a failed home remodeling business run by her second husband when she lived
with him in about 2009, as well as to medical debts accumulated when she had no health
insurance coverage.
At issue in the SOR are the following delinquent debts:
1.a – Collection account ($552) – Addressed. This balance and those noted below
at 1.h ($1,160) and 1.j ($335) are related, consisting of the underlying debt and
two  collection  efforts.  While  it  is  unclear  how  or  when  they  were  combined,
Applicant  provided  a  November  2017  receipt  reflecting  both  entity  names,
payments of $1,381.48, and a showing the balance due is now zero. (FORM, Ex.
A)
1.b – Collection account ($286) – Addressed. This account was settled by payment
of $184.69 in February 20018. (FORM, Ex. B)
1.c-1.d – State tax liens ($28,291, $4,490) – In repayment. Applicant wrote that
these 2009 business taxes were “rolled in” with personal income taxes from 2010
and 2012. (FORM Response Narrative) Applicant explained that her portion of this
debt,  as  opposed  to  that  owed  by  her  second  husband,  is  $10,667.38.  She
provided  a  copy  of  a  payment  schedule  and  evidence  of  $446  debit  payments
since July 2017.
1.e-1.f  –  Federal  tax  liens  ($3,209,  $32,568)  –  No  progress  shown.  On  some
unspecified date, Applicant was told by a representative at the Internal Revenue
Service  (IRS)  that  as  of  October  2014,  these  2007,  2009,  and  2010  personal
income taxes were no longer collectible. She wrote: “They could accept voluntary
payments  but  would  not  create  a  payment  agreement  and  would  not  track  any
payments.” She also wrote that the IRS’ “only solution . . . would be to create a
‘mirror’ account which would separate my-ex-husband and myself and allow me to
pay toward the total, showing my payments. A mirror account would take 90 days
to create.” Applicant provided no documentary evidence substantiating where the
status of these liens last was. (SOR Response Narrative) A February 2018 IRS
letter shows the unpaid balances for 2007, 2009, and 2010 uncollectable because
Applicant “can’t pay the money you owe at this time. . . .” (Supplemental FORM
Response) It reflects $34,370.71 remains at issue.
1.g  –  Medical  collection  ($2,553)  –  No  documentary  evidence.  The  balance  is
owed to a periodontist. Applicant ceased making payments on the balance in early
2013. Applicant wrote she would commence making payments on the balance until
paid, but provided no documentary evidence to that effect. (Ex. D)
1.h – see 1.a above.
1.i  –  Medical  collection  ($400)  –  Addressed.  Applicant  satisfied  this  debt  by
payment of the settlement amount of $133.64 in December 2016. (Ex. E) A second
receipt  from  that  date  shows  the  balance  as  paid  in  full  on  deposit  of  $724.
(Supplemental FORM Response) This account appears to be merged with the one
below at 1.p.
1.j - see 1.a
1.k – Medical collection ($300) – Status unclear. Applicant provided a copy of an
acknowledgement  to  debit  $100  from  Applicant’s  account  toward  this  surgical
practice in December 2016. A handwritten notation indicates “pd in full 12/16,” but
it is unclear if this is a settlement offer or even whether the $100 was drawn. An
accompanying bank statement from April 2016 provides little insight.
1.l – Medical collection ($3,805) - No documentary evidence. Applicant wrote that
this delinquent balance was sufficiently old that she had to request it be put back
on the provider’s books. It is unclear when or if this action transpired. She further
conveyed she does not have to make monthly payments, currently owes $3,5479,
and plans to pay the balance within the next two years.
1.m –  Medical  collection  ($485) –  Addressed.  Applicant  offered a page from  an
Experian  credit  report  showing:  this  account  with  an  original  balance  of  $485,
payments made between September 2016 through January 2017, a handwritten
notation stating “paid 12/15/16,” and no past due amount owed. The account was
opened in 2014. Based on the payments made and lack of outstanding balance, it
is probable this debt was paid.
1.n –  Medical  collection  ($1,047) Unaddressed –  No  documentary  evidenced of
progress by Applicant.
1.o  –  Medical  collection  ($228)  Unaddressed  –  No  documentary  evidenced  of
progress by Applicant.
1.p – Medical collection ($668) – see 1.i above.
