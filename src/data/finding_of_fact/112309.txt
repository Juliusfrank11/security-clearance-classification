Applicant is a 54-year-old program lead/project manager who has served in the
same capacity for over three-and-a-half years. She has earned a bachelor’s degree in
project  management,  as  well  as  a  master’s  degree  in  project  management  and
information technology. She also earned a second master’s degree in cyber forensics.
She is single and has no children. There is no evidence of formal financial counseling.
From  October  1985  to  November  1989,  Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the
United States military. After a period of time as a reservist, she returned to active duty in
early 1992, where she remained until retirement at the level of E-7 in November 2008.
From  that  time  until  March  2013,  she  was  employed  by  a  defense  contractor.  From
March  2013  until  May  2014,  Applicant  was  unemployed  before  accepting  a  brief

At  issue  are  six  delinquent  debts,  five  of  which  are  related  to  federal  or  state
taxes.  In  both  types  of  obligations,  tax  liabilities  were  acquired  which  Applicant  had
insufficient income or resources to  pay. (Tr. 34) Her federal tax issues are reflected in
the  SOR  at  allegations  1.a  ($11,554  November  2015  tax  lien  for  tax  year  2014  taxes
owed),  1.b  ($2,788  for  related  sums  owed  for  tax  year  2013),  and  1.c  ($10,598  for
unpaid tax from tax year 2014).
Applicant began  corresponding  with  the  Government  concerning  her federal tax
issues in 2015. (Tr. 51, 53) Other strides were made in 2016 and in 2017 to address her
federal  tax  obligations  and  work  out  a  settlement  or  reduction.  By  August  2018,  she
started  making  arrangements  to  commence  a  comprehensive  repayment  agreement
with  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS).  (Tr.  49,  51)  The  IRS  dallied  in  arranging  a
repayment  terms.  Applicant  had  no  objection  to  the  delays  because  she  “knew  that  if
[she] started paying [the debt balance] back, the chances of them  offering any type of
forgiveness  of  the  early  withdrawal  fees,  penalties,  interest,  and  so  on  was  nil,  once
[she]  started  paying.”  (Tr.  50,  53)  Consequently,  she  did  not  push  the  issue  because
she hoped her liability would be reduced to just the taxes originally owed.
In May 2019, she tried to contact the IRS by telephone “to determine the status
[of  the  debt]  because  she  had  not  seen  any  correspondence”  in  recent  months
conveying any information except the IRS needed more time to evaluate her situation.
(Tr. 50) She then discovered that the case had been closed with no action by the IRS to
reduce the amount  owed,  and that  the  matter  had  been  transferred  to  collections.  (Tr.
50)  Consequently,  payment  of  $200  on  an  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS  was
made  toward  her 2013  tax  balance  on  May  21,  2019,  followed  by  another payment  in
early June 2019. (Ex. C at 5)
Applicant showed all taxes owed for 2013 (1.b) have been paid and, at this point,
she has a credit of $420.22 on that account. (Ex. M at 2) However, a related lien (1.b)
“will not be released now until ALL back taxes, penalties, and interest have been paid.”
(emphasis in the original) (Ex. J) As for the tax liabilities owed for tax year 2014 (1.c), its
remaining  balance,  which  includes  accrued  penalties  and  interest,  is  in  repayment  as
per the payment plan implemented in May 2019 and referenced above. (Ex. M)
for  unpaid  state
Applicant also owed her state sums at SOR allegations 1.d ($3,766 for a tax lien
taxes).  She  provided
dated  March  2015)  and  1.e  ($3,598
documentation showing that the lien at 1.d has been satisfied and released. (Ex. Q) She
also showed that  a repayment plan on the debt noted at 1.e was initially  implemented
around  September  2017,  then  a  payment  schedule  was  initiated.  A  new  arrangement
was  then  established  in  August  2018.  (Exs.  R-S)  Applicant  showed  she  is  currently  in
good  standing  on  that  plan.  (Ex.  S)  As  of  July  3,  2019,  Applicant  owed  a  balance  of
about $812. (Ex. T) Applicant also provided a copy of a July 3, 2019, check dated July
3,  2019,  and  made  out  for  the  sum  of  approximately  $213  to  be  sent  to  her  state
comptroller toward that balance. (Ex. T)
In addition, Applicant has a sixth delinquent debt at issue. It is for $232,919 and
is  related  to  student  loans  obtained  between  2009  and  2017  (1.f).  At  the  time  of  the
October  4,  2018,  SOR,  they  were  noted  as  being  in  forbearance  until  approximately
October 2018. Applicant finished her education in 2017. Payments were deferred during
her  enrollment.  She  then  had  them  in  forbearance  due  to  her  circumstances.  (Tr.  55)
Applicant  showed  that  the  related  loans  were  subsequently  taken  out  of  forbearance
and have been in timely repayment. (Ex. E at 14-24) She currently pays approximately
$644 a month on the total balance due.
At  present,  Applicant  is  generating  sufficient  income  to  meet  her  regular
obligations  while  making  strides  on  her  tax  and  student  loan  obligations.  She  has  a
monthly net remainder of about $940, which she puts into savings or into her budgeting
for future payments. (Tr. 59) She bought a new car in 2017 in order to replace an older
model  and  secure  safer  travel  for  the  approximately  94,000  miles  she  puts  on  her
vehicle  per  year  commuting.  She  uses  credit  cards  less,  and  otherwise  tends  to
economize.  Applicant recently  sold  a  horse which  had  health  issues,  thus  yielding  her
savings from veterinary and other care.
