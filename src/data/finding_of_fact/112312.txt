Applicant admitted the four financial allegations contained in the SOR. He denied
the personal conduct allegation. He provided some explanations. (Item 2)
Applicant is 44 years old, married, and has three children, ages 22, 19, and 1 . He
earned a bachelor’s degree in 1996. In July 2016, he began a position with a defense
contractor and works overseas. Prior to this position, he owned a martial arts business
for many years and periodically worked for other companies. (Item 3)
In  February  2016,  Applicant  submitted  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA).
Under Section 26: Financial Record, which inquired into his financial history, he did not
disclose  any  financial  delinquencies,  tax  liens,  or  automobile  repossessions.  (Item  3)
During an October 2017 background  interview  with a  government investigator, he was
confronted with information about two tax liens, an automobile repossession, and a 2008
bankruptcy. Applicant stated that he failed to list the 2014 tax lien due to an oversight. He
told the investigator he did not intend to mislead the Government about the information.
He  said  his  wife,  a  lawyer,  manages  their  finances,  implying  that  he  is  not  involved  in
them. He said he was not required to disclose the 2008 bankruptcy because it was outside
the  time  limit  of  the  question.  Although  the  automobile  repossession  account  was  not
charged off until May 2016, which was after he submitted his SCA, the related delinquent
loan  payments  and  resulting  deficiency  debt  occurred  earlier.  He  did  not  disclose  the
repossession or the underlying debt on his SCA, or assert that it first arose after February
2016. He acknowledged to the investigator that he did not disclose this repossession. In
his Answer, he said he did disclose it because he did not know that he owed any money
on the automobile after the car was returned. (Items 1, 2, 8)
Based on credit bureau reports (CBRs) from December 2017 and May 2016, public
records, Applicant’s 2008 bankruptcy documents, and his admissions, the SOR alleged
four financial security concerns. The status of each allegation is as follows:
(SOR ¶ 1.a) In 2013, Applicant entered into a car lease. Toward the end of 2015
he  stopped  making  payments  on  the  lease  and  it  was  repossessed.  This  $8,716
automobile  repossession  debt  was  charged  off  in  May  2016.  Applicant  stated  he  was
trying to negotiate a settlement. (Items 2, 4, 8) It is unresolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.b) In 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a $29,236 income
tax lien against Applicant for unpaid taxes related to a business he owned.1 He said his
wife secured payment of this debt with the IRS through a home equity loan. It will be paid
by the future sale of the house, unless he and his wife pay it sooner. He did not explain
or justify his failure to timely pay the taxes involved, or submit any documentation from
the IRS corroborating the status of this debt or the settlement agreement. (Item 2) It is
unresolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.c) In November 2017, Applicant’s home state filed an income tax lien
against  him  for  $3,629.  Applicant  said  his  wife  negotiated  the  same  settlement  noted
above  with  the  state  taxing  agency.  He  did  not  submit  documentation  from  the  state
corroborating his assertion, or explain why he failed to pay the taxes when due. (Items 2,
6) It is unresolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.d) In March 2008, Applicant and his wife filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
The bankruptcy petition listed outstanding income taxes owed to the IRS for years 2004,
2005, and 2006, and state income taxes owed for those years. It also listed outstanding
student  loans.  The  total  liability  owed  for  unpaid  state  and  Federal  taxes,  and  student
loans was listed as $194,206. Their unsecured nonpriority claims totaled $127,857, and
included  numerous  medical debts, personal  loans,  credit  cards,  and professional fees.
Their personal and real assets totaled $577,031; and their liabilities totaled $893,643. The
bankruptcy was discharged in June 2008. The final amount of debt discharged is unclear,
but delinquent tax and student loan debts are not usually eligible. (Item 7)
The SOR alleged in ¶ 2.a that Applicant deliberately falsified information in his SCA
because  he  failed  to  disclose  the  charged-off  automobile  repossession  debt  and  the
unpaid  Federal  tax  lien  filed  in  2014.  As  noted  above,  Applicant  said  the  2014  tax
omission was an oversight and not intentional. He said he did not report this repossession
because he was unaware that he owed money on the lease.
In his Answer, Applicant said his finances are more stable now and he continues
to pay down his remaining debts. He said the monthly family income now exceeds their
monthly  expenses.  He  stated  that  10  years  ago,  he  experienced  financial  difficulties
because of the real estate market downturn and he was a sole business owner, raising
three young children. (Item 2)
1 The tax years are not in the record; however, Applicant listed his self-employment from 2010 to 2015 in
his SCA. (Item 3)
