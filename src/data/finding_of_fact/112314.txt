Applicant,  46,  has  worked  as  a  project  manager  for  federal  contracting
companies since 1999. She has been in her current position since May 2018. Applicant
has  previously  held  public  trust  eligibility  and  a  security  clearance  issued  by  other
federal  agencies.  She  completed  her  most  recent  security  clearance  application  in
September  2014,  disclosing  four  delinquent  accounts  and  one  account  she  was
disputing  with  a  creditor.  The  ensuing  investigation  revealed  additional  delinquent
accounts.  The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  owes  $97,705  in  delinquent  debt,  including
$3,496 and $31,841 in outstanding state and federal income taxes, respectively. (GE 1
– 7; Tr. 23-24).
Applicant blames her financial problems on a series of events between 2012 and
2018.  First,  she  experienced  three  periods  of  unemployment,  totaling  seven  months.
Second,  Applicant  was  involved  in  a  serious  motorcycle  accident  in  March  2015  that
resulted in months of recovery during which she collected disability income at a fraction
of  her  pay.  In  March  2016,  she  lost  her  job  earning  $184,000.  When  she  returned  to
work  in  May  2016,  she  did  so  earning  $120,000.  Although,  her  income  has  increased
over  the  years,  she  has  not  been  able  to  secure  a  position  at  the  pay  she  earned  in
2016.  In  addition,  Applicant  serves  as  the  financial  pillar  of  her  family.  She  is  often
called  upon  to  help  family  members  with  unexpected  expenses,  as  was  the  case  in
2015, when she paid the burial and related expenses for two family members. Divorced
in 2002, Applicant raised her two children, now adults, on her own without the benefit of
child support. She continues to provide financial support to one of her children and her
parents, totaling $1,500 each month. (GE 1; Tr. 25-28, 30-32, 57-58, 60).
In her March 2018 answer to the SOR, Applicant provided documentation that  in
February  2018,  she  resolved  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  –  1.i,  and  1.l  –  1.m,
totaling  $3,350.  She  also  established  that  she  rehabilitated  her  mortgage  (SOR  ¶  1.a,
$21,175), to current status, explaining that she refinanced the loan and added the past-
due  amount  to  the  principal  balance  of  the  loan.  However,  at  the  hearing,  Applicant
admitted  that  she  was  one  month  behind  on  the  refinanced  mortgage  loan.    Applicant
also  credibility  testified  that  she  was  unable  to  find  the  creditor  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.n
($322).  The  delinquent  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  –  1.c,  1.j  –  1.k,  and  1.o,  totaling
almost $73,000, remain unresolved. (Answer; Tr. 17-22, 34-37, 40-42, 44-46).
Applicant  incurred  the  largest  debt,  SOR  ¶  1.b  for  $27,401,  when  she  was
medically evacuated by helicopter under emergent circumstances to a hospital after her
March  2015  motorcycle  accident.  Her  insurance  carrier  declined  to  cover  the  related
charges because the helicopter transport service, which Applicant did not choose, was
out of network. Applicant claims that she has been making $150 payments each month
since  November  2018.  She  did  not  provide  any  corroborating  evidence  of  these
payments.  The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.d  is  the  deficiency  balance  on  an  automobile
loan  Applicant  co-signed  for  her  son.  Applicant  claims  that  the  outstanding  balance  is
$6,000, not $10,000 as alleged. She did not provide documentation to corroborate this
information. (Tr. 37-40).
The  SOR  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.j,  1.k,  and  1.o  are  related  to  outstanding
state and federal income taxes. Applicant blames her tax problems on the actions of the
tax preparer she used at the time. In 2012, Applicant started her own business. She did
not  understand  the  tax  requirements  of  being  self-employed.  Relying  on  her  tax
preparer’s advice, Applicant did not pay income taxes as she earned income, resulting
in a $31,842 federal income tax obligation that she could not afford to pay. (Tr. 68-69).
Applicant testified that she began mailing payments toward the 2012 federal tax
debt  in  November  2017  and  that  the    IRS  entered  into  an  installment  agreement  with
her  in  February  2018.  She  agreed  to  pay  $300  per  month.  In  October  2018,  the  IRS
cancelled  the  agreement  for  nonpayment.  Applicant  explained  that  she  made  her
monthly payments as required, but sent them to the wrong address. The IRS returned
the  payments  to  her.  After  the  hearing,  Applicant  negotiated  a  new  installment
agreement with the IRS, in which she agrees to pay $315 for 71 months to resolve her
tax liability. According to documentation provided by Applicant’s state tax authority, she
owes  $2,449  in  unpaid  state  taxes.  In  December  2017,  she  established  a  monthly
payment plan of $115. She did not provide a history of payments for her outstanding tax
liabilities  or  documentation  confirming  the  new  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS.
(Answer; AE A; Tr. 43, 48-50, 67).
The  record  shows  that  Applicant  failed  to  file  her  2012  through  2014  federal
income  tax  returns  on  time.  According  to  the  tax  transcripts,  she  did  not  file  for
extensions. The  2012 and 2013  returns  were filed  in August  2014.  She filed  her 2014
federal  income  tax  return  in  May  2015.  In  December  2017,  Applicant  received  a  letter
from the IRS indicating that no returns were filed for the 2015 and 2016 tax years. It is
unclear from the record when the returns were filed, but she did not owe any additional
tax  liabilities  for  either  year.  At  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  she  had  yet  to  file  her
federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for  2017.  She  filed  the  outstanding  state  and
federal income tax returns when she filed her 2018 returns in April 2019. She received
refunds for both years, which will be applied to her outstanding tax balances.  (Answer;
GE 2; AE A; Tr. 42-44, 47).
Applicant  currently  earns  $150,000.  She  also  does  occasional  odd  jobs  to  earn
additional money. In 2017, she sought financial counseling and made life style changes
to reduce her delinquent debt. (Tr. 32-33, 63-65).
