Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for
defense  contractors  since  2010.  She  seeks  to  retain  a  security  clearance,  which  she
has held since 2011. She has a bachelor’s degree, which was awarded in 2014, and a
master’s degree, which was awarded in 2009. She is married with an infant child.1
Applicant  smoked  marijuana  about  five  to  seven  times  from  2001  to  2008.  She
was in college and graduate school at the time. She reported her marijuana use on the
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) she submitted in September 2010.
During  her  background  interview  in  October  2010,  she  stated  that  she  regretted  using
marijuana  and  she  did  not  intend  to  use  marijuana  or  any  other  illegal  drug  in  the
future.2
Applicant had surgery in 2013. She was in considerable pain and was prescribed
narcotic  painkillers.  She  had  side  effects  from  the  narcotics,  including  constipation,
headaches,  vomiting,  and  a  “fuzzy”  head.  She  had  another  surgery  in  October  2015.
She  was  again  prescribed  opioid  painkillers.  She  completed  the  course  of  narcotics
prescribed  to  her,  but  she  was  still  in  a  great  deal  of  pain.  A  friend  offered  her  some
marijuana  for  her  pain.  Applicant  lives  in  a  jurisdiction  that  permitted  medical  and
recreational marijuana use. She chose to accept the marijuana from the friend because
she  received  it  immediately  without  having  to  wait  for  it  to  be  prescribed  by  a  doctor.
Applicant used the marijuana over the course of a few weeks to alleviate her pain.3
Applicant  knew  that  her  marijuana  use  was  against  federal  law  and  contrary  to
her company’s and DOD’s policies, even though it was not illegal in her jurisdiction and
even  if  it  had  been  prescribed  by  a  doctor.  However,  she  did  not  realize  the  full
ramifications of her actions.4
Applicant  reported  her  marijuana  use  on  the  SF  86  she  submitted  in  February
2016 and during her background interview in September 2017. She provided a signed
statement of intent to abstain from all illegal drug use with the acknowledgment that any
future  involvement  with  illegal  drugs  would  be  grounds  for  revocation  of  her  security
clearance.  She  credibly  testified  that  she  will  not  use  any  illegal  drugs,  including
marijuana for pain management, in the future.5
Applicant  submitted  documents  and  letters  attesting  to  her  excellent  job
performance  and  strong  moral  character.  She  is  praised  for  her  professionalism,
