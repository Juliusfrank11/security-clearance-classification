Applicant is 31 years old. He graduated from high school in 2005 and obtained his
bachelor’s degree in 2012. He has been employed as a software engineer for a federal
contractor  since  March  2017.  He  previously  left  graduate  school  to  work  for  a  major
automobile  manufacturer  in  Detroit  from  2014  to  2017.  He  was  married  in  2013  and
reports no children and no military service. Applicant has not previously held a security
clearance. (Tr. 43)
On May 5, 2017, Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SCA), and
in section 23 (illegal use of drugs or drug activity) he responded “yes” to questions about
illegal  drug  use  and/or  misuse  of  prescription  drugs  within  the  last  seven  years.  He
estimated his use of marijuana MJ was from 2001 with varying frequency and his last use
was  in  2017.2  He  also  disclosed  that  he  used  LSD  once  in  2016,  and  hallucinogenic
mushrooms twice, in 2010 and 2015.3 He indicated that his spiritual and soul-searching
experiences  are  over  and  he  does  not  intend  to  use  any  controlled  substances  in  the
future. He also signed a statement promising to abstain from future use of illegal drugs
and medicinal MJ and acknowledging any future use would be grounds for revocation of
his national security eligibility. (AE A, attachment 1; Tr. 15)
Applicant  was  forced  to  take  medical  leave  from  college  in  2010  due  to  a
devastating disease diagnosis. (Tr. 22) He required extensive surgery, removal of a large
part of his intestine, and multiple transfusions. (Tr. 23) He provided a detailed summary
of his medical conditions and treatments. (AE A, Attachment 4) He is coping with multiple
life-threatening  illnesses.  He  also  required  an  ostomy  bag  (Tr.  26)  Consequently,  he
suffered from anxiety and depression and complex post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
due to what he describes as a lack of adequate coping skills. (Tr. 28)
Applicant described himself as a socially awkward youth. He smoked marijuana
socially every couple of weeks during high school (HS) due to peer pressure. However,

1).
2 At the hearing, he testified that his last use of medical marijuana was in December 2018.

he stopped using it early in HS when his mother caught him in 2003. He resumed using
MJ in college, but never purchased MJ or sold it. (Tr. 31-32) He used MJ once every two
or three months in college. (Tr. 57) He stopped using MJ socially once he started working
full time after college as it no longer fit his lifestyle and he no longer associated with the
same friends. (Tr. 31)
The first time Applicant took hallucinogenic mushrooms was in 2010 after his initial
diagnosis. (Tr. 32) They were a gift. (Tr. 52) A friend suspected Applicant was depressed
and offered the mushroom suggesting it would help. The second time was when Applicant
and his wife took mushrooms that were given to them as a proposed bonding experience.
(Tr. 33) Neither one liked the effects nor will they ever use mushrooms again. (Tr. 33)
Applicant also admitted to experimenting with LSD one time in 2016. (Answer, Tr. 33) It
was offered to him in a social setting at a Spring festival. (Tr. 34) He did not enjoy it and
will never try it, or any other illegal drug, again. He no longer associates with the festival
attendees. (Tr. 34)
Most  of  the  pain  management  surrounding  Applicant’s  multiple  surgeries  was
opiate based. (Tr. 35) He was prescribed medicinal MJ by a physician in April 2017 to
help  with  stress  and  aid  recovery.  MJ  was  legalized  in  his  state  in  2008.  (Tr.  60)  He
received  a  medical  marijuana  card.  (AE  A,  attachment  5,  Tr.  35)  Applicant  testified
credibly that the medical MJ helped with his unique medical conditions. (Tr. 36) He last
used MJ recreationally before he left college in 2014. He believed that his medical MJ
use starting in 2017 was legal in his state, and he never shared it with anybody. Now,
since receiving the SOR, he understands that the Federal Government considers all MJ
use  to  be  illegal.  (Tr.  37)  Applicant  attributes  his  past  drug  use  to  untreated  or  poorly
managed medical conditions. (Tr. 40) He is taking different medications now.
Applicant testified credibly that he informed his current employer about his medical
MJ use. (Tr. 39) He was hired by a college friend who responded that it was fine so long
as Applicant had the medical MJ certification. (Tr. 39) He concedes that his MJ use before
2014 was illegal. (Tr. 52) Applicant stopped using medical MJ in December 2018 after
enduring two more surgeries in 2017. (Tr. 66) That was about nine months after the SOR
issued.  (Tr.  65)  He  did  not  stop  using  sooner  due  to  confusion  about  the  interplay  of
options and laws surrounding MJ use. (Tr. 66)
Applicant has never been diagnosed as having a substance-abuse disorder and
he  did  not  seek  treatment.  He  has  now  disassociated  from  friends  who  use  MJ
recreationally. He last used MJ recreationally in 2014, and subsequent use was under
physician’s care and for medicinal purposes only.
