Applicant is 26 years old and married. He was born in Afghanistan in 1991. In 1992,
his father, a commander in the Afghan military, was assassinated. Shortly thereafter, his
mother  fled  to  Pakistan  with  Applicant,  his  sister,  and  his  brother.  They  remained  in
Pakistan until 2001 when they immigrated the United States as refugees. They became
U.S. citizens in 2007 and continue to reside in the United States. (Item 4)
Applicant graduated from high school in 2009. He subsequently obtained student
loans  and  attended  a  U.S.  college  between  August  2010  and  May  2015.  He  did  not
complete a degree. While in college, he was unemployed for some months and financially
supported by his brother. (Items 4-6)
Applicant visited Afghanistan multiple times since becoming a U.S. citizen in 2007:
from  December  2013  to  January  2014;  June  2014  to  July  2014;  December  2014  to
January  2015;  March  2015;  July  2015;  August  2016;  June  2017; and  August  2017. In
December 2013, Applicant married his wife in Afghanistan. She is an Afghanistan citizen
and was residing there at the time. (Items 4 and 6) Applicant and his wife had a son born
in Afghanistan. In 2017, his wife moved to the United States with their young son and she
became a permanent U.S. resident. (Item 3)
Applicant’s  mother-in-law  and  father-in-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Afghanistan. His mother-in-law is a homemaker and his father-in-law is a taxi driver. His
father-in-law  is  also  Applicant’s  uncle.  Applicant  has  three  brothers-in-law.  Two  are
citizens and residents of Afghanistan. One brother-in-law is citizen of Afghanistan and a
permanent  U.S.  resident.  That  brother-in-law  previously  worked  for  the  Afghan  police.
Applicant has monthly contact with his in-laws residing in Afghanistan. Applicant stayed
with his in-laws when he visited Afghanistan. (Item 3, 4, 6)
Applicant  has  eight  friends  and  a  cousin,  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Afghanistan. He has yearly contact with six friends and quarterly contact with two friends.
He contacts his cousin yearly. (Item 5) Applicant said that since his wife has moved to the
United States, he no longer needs to maintain contact with multiple family members or
friends in Afghanistan. (Item 3)
Based  on  credit  bureau  reports  (CBR)  from  May  2017,  January  2018,  and  May
2018, the SOR alleged six debts that became delinquent between 2014 and 2018, and
totaled  over  $14,503.  They  included  an  automobile  repossession,  three  unpaid  credit
cards, an unpaid cell phone bill, and unpaid tuition. (Items 8, 9, 10)
In  his  Answer,  Applicant  stated  that  he  is  responsible  for  resolving  the  alleged
debts. He said that he is making payments on the $371 credit card debt. The most recent
CBR confirmed that the $371 debt listed in SOR ¶ 1.a had a balance of $143 as of April
2018.  (Item  10).  He  also  stated  that  he paid  the  $143  cell  phone debt, but  there  is  no
evidence to confirm that status. Applicant said he intended to pay the other four debts
when he has more money. (Item 3)
According  to  the  May  2018  CBR,  Applicant  has  student  loans  that  total  about
$53,350. SOR ¶ 1.f alleged that one of those loans has a delinquent balance of $2,607.
Applicant has not made arrangements to make payments on that loan. He makes nominal
payments of $1 to $3 on several other student loans. (Item 10)
Applicant  was  employed  full-time  from  October  2015  to  January  2016  with  a
temporary staffing firm. He then obtained a full-time position with a healthcare company.
He continues to work for that company while his application for a security clearance is
pending. (Item 6)
Applicant admitted that he provided $19,400 of financial support to his wife from
2013  until  2017,  before  she  moved  to  the  United  States.  Throughout  the  case  file,  he
stated that as a consequence of sending her money and traveling to Afghanistan, he did
not have sufficient money to pay the alleged delinquent debts. (Items 3-6)
Applicant  did  not  provide  a  current  budget  or  other  information  related  to  his
financial obligations from which to determine his current financial reliability, compliance
with  payment  agreements,  or  ability  to  maintain  payments  on  the  debts.  There  is  no
evidence that he has financial investments or other monetary connections in the United
States. Applicant asserts that his loyalty is to the United States. (Item 2)
Afghanistan
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  facts  contained  in  U.S.  Government
pronouncements  concerning  the  state  of  Afghanistan.  Specifically,  Afghanistan  faces
many challenges fueled by sectarian and ethnic divisions. Numerous terrorist groups are
increasingly active throughout Afghanistan. Threats of kidnapping and violence are high,
and the Department of State warns U.S. citizens that all travel to Afghanistan should be
avoided.  Of  particular  significance  are  the  poor  human  rights  situation;  the  active  and
hostile presence of Al Qaida, the Taliban, the Haqqani Network; and other insurgent and
extremist groups that generate instability and openly attack police, security and military
forces, the local populace, and U.S. persons and interests.
