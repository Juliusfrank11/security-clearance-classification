Applicant  admitted  four  SOR  allegations  and  denied  the  remaining  three.  Her
admissions are incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings
and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She recently began
working at her present job in approximately November 2018. She was laid off from her
previous  contractor  job  and  was  unemployed  from  May  to  October  2018.  Before  that,
she  worked  for  other  federal  contractors.  She  is  married,  but  recently  separated  from
her husband. She has four adult children. She has a high school diploma and has taken
some college courses.1
The SOR alleged Applicant failed to file her federal and state income tax returns
for  years  2012  and  2013,  and  that  she  had  five  delinquent  collection  debts  totaling
approximately $11,430. Four of the debts are delinquent medical debts and the fifth is a
deficiency  from  a  vehicle  repossession  for  a  car  loan  she  cosigned  with  her  daughter.
She admitted not filing her tax returns during her interview with a defense investigator in
March 2017 and during her testimony. The debts were listed in credit reports from May
2016, August 2017, and May 2018 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.g).2
Applicant  credibly  explained  that  she  failed  to  file  her  tax  returns  because  she
experienced a series of medical issues that debilitated her to the point that she thought
she had filed those returns when she had not. She was also unemployed during some
of this time. She explained that she had hip surgery in 2009; back surgery in 2010; foot
surgery in 2013; and another back surgery, involving fusion, in 2014. She was heavily
medicated  after  these  surgeries,  which  caused  her  to  lose  focus  on  daily  life  matters.
After  she  completed  her  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  in  March  2016,  she
received correspondence from the IRS indicating that she failed to file her tax returns for
2012 and 2013. This is when she was first made aware that those returns were not filed.
Applicant filed her 2012 and 2013 federal tax returns in April  2017. She contacted the
state  taxing  authority  to  determine  what  years  she  needed  to  file.  Because  of  a
communication  breakdown  with  the  state  tax  authority,  she  did  not  file  her  2012  and
2013 state tax returns until March 2018. She paid the required tax due for those years
(totaling $80) at the same time. She filed all of her federal and state tax returns before
2012 and has filed them all for tax years 2014 forward.3
1 Tr. at 5, 19-21; GE 1.
2 GE 3-6.
3 Tr. at 23, 25-27; Answer; GE 2-3.
The status of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR is as follows:
Repossession  account-$4,626.  This  is  an  automobile  loan  account  Applicant
cosigned with her daughter in 2011. Applicant’s daughter stopped making payments on
the  debt,  and  Applicant  continued  to  do  so  through  approximately  2014.  Her
unemployment  and  medical  issues  caused  her  to  stop  making  payments  at  that  time.
She has been in contact with the creditor attempting to work out a payment plan.4
Four  Medical  Accounts-$2,788;  $1,822;  $2,144;  $50.  Applicant  documented
that three of the medical debts were settled and are resolved. Concerning the remaining
debt, Applicant provided post-hearing information that she entered into a payment plan
to make $100 monthly auto payments to the creditor. None of these accounts appear on
her most recent credit report.5
Applicant  testified  that  her  current  finances  are  in  good  order  and  that  she
typically has an $800 monthly surplus after paying all her expenses. She is current on
her  car  loan,  her  camper,  and  her  student  loans.  Her  May  2018  credit  report
corroborates these assertions.6
