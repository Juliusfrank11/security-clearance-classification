In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.e,
with explanations. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 2.a. His admissions are
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  35  years  old.  He  was  born  in  Iraq  in  1983.  He  lived  there  until  he
immigrated to the United States in 2008. He became a U.S. citizen in 2013. In 2006, he
received  his  bachelor’s  degree  from  an  Iraqi  university.  He  is  employed  in  the  private
sector,  but  is  pursuing  a  linguist  position  with  a  federal  contractor,  for  which  he  is
seeking a security clearance. He has never been married and has no children.3
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant’s  mother,  four  brothers  and  his  sister  are  all
residents  and  citizens  of  Afghanistan.  It  further  alleged  that  one  brother  works  for  the
Iraqi  National  Police.  The  SOR  also  alleged  that  Applicant  has  one  friend,  who  is  a
resident and citizen of Iraq, and who is also currently enlisted in the Iraqi Army; and a
second  friend,  a  resident  and  citizen  of  Iraq,  who  is  employed  by  the  Iraqi
Counterterrorism  unit.  The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  admitted  his  allegiance  to  the
United States and Iraq was divided to about 50 percent to each country.

Applicant was hired locally as a linguist from 2004 to 2008 for U.S. forces in Iraq.
He  provided  linguist  services  at  several  different  locations  and  for  several  different
missions.  In  approximately  2005,  he  began  working  at  a  police  academy  providing
linguistic  services  to  U.S.  forces  who  were  training  Iraqi  police  candidates.  He  later
transitioned  to  missions  that  had  him  working  “outside  the  wire”  providing  linguistic
services to U.S. forces at roadside checkpoints and providing liaison services between
U.S. forces and local leaders. His work was hazardous. He experienced frequent rocket
propelled  grenade  (RPG)  attacks  from  insurgent  forces.  In  approximately  2007,  he
began  providing  linguistic  services  at  an  Iraqi  detention  facility.  At  this  facility,  where
approximately  20,000  Arabic-speaking  detainees  were  held,  Applicant  translated
sensitive  written  and  oral  documents  for  U.S.  forces.  He  was  awarded  a  certificate  of
appreciation  from  a  U.S.  Army  Military  Police  Battalion  for  his  work  at  the  detention
facility.4
The current status of Applicant’s relatives listed in the SOR is as follows:
1. Applicant’s mother (M). M is 68 years old and in poor health. She immigrated
to  the  United  States  in  2015.  She  is  a  legal  resident  alien  in  this  country  (green  card
holder). She lives with Applicant who provides for her. She is currently visiting Iraq. She
returned  to  Iraq  in  May  2018  to  visit  her  husband’s  gravesite  (he  passed  away  in
January 2018). She intended to stay approximately 15 days. She experienced bleeding
while there and was diagnosed with cancer. Currently, she is undergoing chemotherapy
and unable to travel. She is staying in the house her husband owned presently occupied
by  her  sons  and  daughter.  She  intends  to  return  to  the  United  States  when  she  is
healthy enough to do so. She has no affiliations with the Iraqi government or military.5
2. Applicant’s four brothers and sister (B1-B4, S1). B1 immigrated to this country
in 2015 with his mother. He is a legal resident alien (green card holder). He lives with
Applicant and their mother. He works for a private sector employer. He took his mother
to  Iraq  in  May  2018,  but  returned  alone  after  15  days  when  she  experienced  medical
issues. B2 is a resident and citizen of Iraq. He works for the Iraqi National Police as a
corrections  officer.  Applicant  has  infrequent  contact  with  him,  possibly  on  a  quarterly
basis through social media. B3 is a resident and citizen of Iraq. He is unemployed. He
has  no  government  or  military  affiliation.  Applicant  has  contact  with  him  approximately
twice  a  year.  B4  is  a  resident  and  citizen  of  Iraq.  He  works  in  customer  service  for  a
telecommunication  company.  He  has  no  government  or  military  affiliations.  Applicant
has  quarterly  contact  with  him.  S1  is  a  resident  and  citizen  of  Iraq.  She  is  a  school
teacher. Applicant has quarterly contact with her. All of Applicant’s siblings were aware
of his linguist work for U.S. forces from 2004 to 2008. There were no repercussions as a
result.6

3. Applicant’s two friends (F1 and F2). Both F1 and F2 are residents and citizens
of Iraq. Applicant met them when he was attending college. Applicant’s last contact with
F1 was in 2016. Applicant knew that F1 was in the Iraqi Army at one time, but now he
has  no  idea  as  to  F1’s  status.  Applicant’s  last  contact  with  F2  was  in  April  2017.  He
knew  that  F2  was  working  for  an  Iraqi  counterterrorism  unit.  At present,  Applicant  has
no idea what F2 does for a living.7
Applicant  addressed  his  apparent  statement  to  a  defense  investigator  in  June
2017 during his background interview. The investigator noted in his report that Applicant
stated  that  his  allegiance  to  the  two  countries  was  50  percent  each.  In  March  2018,
when  given  a  chance  to  review  the  investigator’s  summarized  interview,  Applicant
explained that he meant that he still appreciated the culture, history, and the arts of Iraq,
however, he has no allegiance to the government of Iraq. His undivided allegiance is to
the United States as demonstrated by his willingness to put himself in harm’s way while
working with U.S. forces in Iraq. During his testimony, he reiterated his allegiance to the
United  States,  while  also  explaining  that  he  will  always  love  the  history  and  culture  of
Iraq. He documented that his Iraqi passport expired in 2016 and has not been renewed.
He has a current U.S. passport that was issued in 2017.8
Character Evidence.
Applicant  supplied  character  references
four  military  commanders
associated with his translator duties from 2007 to 2008. All those commanders noted his
trustworthiness  and  other  positive  character  traits  that  made  him  a  valuable  asset.
Additionally,  the  Deputy  Task  Force  Commander,  a  Marine  major  general,  stated  that
Applicant  “risked  his  life  in  support  of  Coalition  Forces  in  Iraq  while  other  interpreters
have been kidnapped, killed, or quit. [Applicant’s] dedication, commitment, and support
to our cause no doubt saved the lives of American soldiers.”9
from
Administrative Notice.
The  U.S.  State  Department  warns  U.S.  citizens  against  travel  to  Iraq  as  travel
within the country remains dangerous. The U.S. Embassy warns that U.S. citizens are at
high  risk  for  kidnapping  and  violence  and  to  avoid  all  but  essential  travel  to  Iraq.  The
U.S. government considers the potential threat to U.S. government personnel in Iraq to
be serious enough to require them to live and work under strict security guidelines. The
Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Levant  (ISIL)  remained  the  greatest  terrorist  threat  globally,
maintaining a formidable force in Iraq and Syria.10
