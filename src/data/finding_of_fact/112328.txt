Applicant  is  48  years  old  and  married.  He  reports  no  children.  He  was  born  in
Bulgaria  and  moved  to  Turkey  at  age  seven.  He  came  to  the  United  States  (U.S.)  in
1996  to  further  his  education  because  Turkey  plummeted  into  chaos.  He  became  a
naturalized U.S. citizen in 2011. He earned a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree
1  Unless  otherwise  stated,  the  basis  for  these  findings  of  fact  is  Applicant’s  Questionnaire  for  National
Security  Positions (SCA) dated  August 23, 2016 (GE 1) and the summary of personal subject interview
conducted on September 25, 2017. (GE 2)
before emigrating from Turkey. He obtained his Ph.D. in the U.S. in 2000. (GE 1, Tr. 12)
He has been employed as a senior engineer by a U.S. corporation since 2000 and he
has  recently  applied  for  another  position  with  a  federal  contractor,  which  approval  is
contingent  on  Applicant  obtaining  a  security  clearance.  (Tr.  60)  Applicant  provided
documents  listing  his  professional  accomplishments,  including  numerous  certificates
and awards, and 12 U.S. patents in his field of micro-electrical mechanical systems. He
also listed his academic accomplishments. (AE A, B, C)
Applicant testified that he or his wife, a naturalized U.S. citizen, owned three real
estate  parcels  in  Turkey  before  he  became  a  U.S.  citizen.  (Tr.  15,  47)  His  wife
purchased  an  apartment  in  Turkey  in  2006  before  they  were  married.  She  is  the  sole
owner. (AE H) He purchased a second property in Turkey in 2008. (Tr. 49) Applicant’s
wife  purchased  a  third  apartment  for  her  totally  disabled  mother  to  live  close  to  her
relatives  in  2012,  the  year  of  their  marriage.  (AE  D,  Tr.  50)  The  three  real-estate
holdings alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d have lost 50–60% in value compared to when they were
purchased, due to the tumultuous conditions in Turkey. (Tr. 15-16) Applicant provided a
graph that visually depicts the details of their purchases of real estate in Turkey. (AE D)
Applicant  testified  credibly  that  the  exchange  rate  for  Turkish  currency  (lira)  was
relatively flat for a long time, but then it lost half of its value on world markets in a five-
year span from 2012 to 2017. (Tr. 48)
Applicant  testified  that  the  property,  which  he  purchased  in  Turkey  in  2008,
actually  was  not  completely  built  until  2013,  due  to  chaos  in  that  country.  (Tr.  74)
Therefore, it could not be sold previously. Applicant’s wife became a U.S. citizen in June
2017. She was a market researcher in Turkey previously and she had no affiliation with
the Turkish government. Her mother also has a green card as a permanent resident in
the U.S. since 2017. (Tr. 76) Applicant testified credibly that it was extremely difficult to
sell the real estate in Turkey due to instability, its loss in value, and a saturated market
from  overdevelopment  around  Istanbul.  (Tr.  50-51,  AE  D)  He  provided  supplemental
post-hearing documents including a deed showing that the real estate he purchased in
2008  has  now  been  donated  or  conveyed  to  his  sister  under  Turkish  law.  Applicant’s
wife provided a power of attorney (POA) dated January 28, 2019, to effectuate the sale
of  property  purchased  for  his  mother-in-law.  (AE  H)  Applicant’s  former  Turkish  real
estate interests had a total value of $337,000. (Tr. 58)
Applicant has telephonic contact with his parents once or twice a week. (Tr. 63)
Applicant contacts his sister living in Turkey only in crisis. (Tr. 66) He had a falling out
with  his  sister  because  she  is  angry  that  Applicant  lives  so  far  away,  and  the  care  of
their  infirm  parents  falls  to  her.  (Tr.  67-69)  Applicant’s  80-year-old  father  had  brain
surgery in 2016 and he has not recovered well. (Tr. 30) Applicant testified that the last
crisis was when his father fell down and lacerated his scalp and Applicant flew to Turkey
in  September  2018  to  assist.  (Tr.  69)  His  father  is  prone  to  falling  and  often  injures
himself. Applicant has visited Turkey about once a year for the last ten years. (Tr. 69-
70) Applicant’s 76-year-old mother had a heart attack and subsequent bypass surgery,
also  in  2012.  (Tr.  32)  His  parents  never  had  any  affiliation  or  employment  with  the
Turkish  government  of  intelligence  agencies.  (Tr.  42)  Applicant  never  sent  them
financial aid.
Applicant owns real estate and other assets in the U.S. as well. He purchased a
home  in  September  2014,  for  $533,000.  His  mortgage  on  that  property  is  down  from
$276,000  to  $248,000.  (Tr.  56,  AE  D)  Applicant  has  more  than  50%  equity  in  that
property. He also has a $287,000 retirement account; $262,000 savings account in U.S.
banks;  and  approximately  $100,000  in  publicly  traded  stocks  and  bonds.  Applicant’s
U.S.  assets,  excluding  real  estate,  total  over  $650,000.  (Tr.  61)  He  has  no  intent  to
return to Turkey, unless it is to visit and help care for his parents in crisis. (Tr. 76, 93)
Applicant communicates via telephone only with his parents in Turkey, and nobody else.
(Tr. 81) Applicant testified credibly that the plan is for his parents to leave everything to
his sister, when they pass, as she has primarily cared for them. (Tr. 88)
