Applicant is a 35-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance
at  a  higher  level  than  previously  granted  to  him  in  2008.  (Tr.  7)  He  is  employed  as  a
system administrator for a company in the defense industry. He has been so employed
since  November  2015;  he  transferred  to  his  current  location  in  July  2016.  He  was
initially  hired  at  an  annual  salary  of  $65,000;  he  received  a  promotion  when  he
transferred to his current location; and his current annual salary is $78,000. He works in
direct  support  of  a  military  organization  located  on  a  military  installation.  His  formal
education includes an associate’s degree from a technical institute awarded in 2004. He
has never married, but he and his longtime fiancée have a ten-year-old child.
Applicant’s  employment  history  includes  three  periods  of  unemployment  during
2012-2015. (Exhibit 1) He worked as an assistant systems administrator from May 2008
to August 2012, when he was laid off. He was out work for about two months. (Tr. 25)
He accepted a job as a systems administrator in support of a contract that required him
to  live  and  work  in  Afghanistan.  He  worked  overseas  until  about  May  2014  when  the
contract  ended.  He  was  then  out  of  work  for  about  three  months,  from  May  2014  to
August 2014. During that time, he  enjoyed spending time with his family, including two
trips to Hawaii to visit family. He returned to work as a system administrator in August
2014 and had that job until September 2015, when he was laid off. He was then out of
work for about two months, from September 2015 to November 2015, when he began
working for his current employer. Other than those three periods, Applicant has had full-
time employment in his field since at least June 2006.
The  SOR  concerns  a history  of financial  problems  consisting  of  nine  delinquent
accounts, in collection or charged off, in amounts ranging from $88 to $10,593 for a total
of about $21,674. The two largest debts, for $10,593 and $6,158, stem from automobile
loans  that  ended  in  repossession  resulting  in  deficiency  balances.  None  of  the  nine
delinquent  debts  are  medical  collection  accounts.  Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR
allegations in his answer to the SOR and during his hearing testimony. In addition, the
delinquent debts are established by credit reports from 2016, 2017, and 2018. (Exhibits
2-5).  None  of  the  nine  delinquent  debts  were  paid,  settled,  entered  into  a  repayment
arrangement, forgiven, cancelled, or otherwise resolved. (Tr. 31)
Overall, Applicant attributed his financial problems or difficulties to unemployment
and  the  expenses  associated  with  providing  for  his  fiancée  and  young  child.  He
accepted  the  job  in  Afghanistan,  where  he  earned  more  than  $100,000  annually,  not
including a substantial bonus, in order to focus on reducing his student loan debt. (Tr.
25, 35-36) He stated that he reduced the balance from about $40,000 to $11,000. (Tr.
35)  The  most  recent  credit  report  from  September  2018  shows  a  balance  of  $19,818
with $0 past due. (Exhibit 5) Applicant described his current financial situation as living
paycheck to paycheck. (Tr. 44) He estimated a checking account balance of $1,000 and
a savings account balance of $0. (Tr. 37-38) The September 2018 credit report shows a
new collection account for $680 stemming from an apartment lease. (Exhibit 5; Tr. 36-
37)
In  September  2018,  a  few  days  before  the  hearing  in  this  case,  Applicant
retained the services of a firm that specializes in credit repair and optimization. (Exhibit
A; Tr. 27-29)  He pays  a monthly fee  of  $100 for  the  service.  His goal is to  restore  his
credit to good standards.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has
1  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S.  518,  528  (1988)  (“it  should  be  obvious  that  no  one  has  a
‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no
right to a security clearance).

followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.6
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;
AG  ¶  20(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  a  death,  divorce,  or

separation,  clear  victimization  by  predatory  lending  practices,  or  identity
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.  The
disqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.
Applicant  is  in  a  difficult  situation  dealing  with  a  large  amount  of  indebtedness
with a number of creditors or collectors. His problematic financial history is traceable to
three relatively brief periods of unemployment during 2012-2015. One of those periods
also  served  as  rest  and  recreation  after  returning  from  his  job  in  Afghanistan.  The  job
layoffs and periods of unemployment were circumstances largely beyond his control. He
used  the  additional  income  he  earned  working  in  Afghanistan  during  2012-2014  to
attack the large balance on his student loan, which was not unreasonable.
Nevertheless,  what  is  missing  here  is  obvious;  namely,  Applicant  failed  to  take
any  substantial  affirmative  action  (“a  good-faith  effort”)  to  resolve  the  nine  delinquent
debts for more  than $20,000  in the SOR.  Not  even  the  smallest  collection account  for
$88  was  paid.  This  lack  of  action  occurred  despite  his  full-time  employment  since
November  2015,  and  earning  a  decent  income  ranging  from  $65,000  to  $78,000  at
present.  His  action  in  September  2018  in  retaining  a  credit-repair  firm  cannot  be
considered a good-faith effort at this time. It is an initial step in the right direction, but it
is too soon to tell if it will result in either a large or small reduction of his indebtedness.
Given  the  totality  of  facts  and  circumstances,  the  evidence  is  not  sufficient  to  mitigate
the  security  concern  stemming  from  his  long-standing  history  of  financial  problems,
which is ongoing and likely to continue for the foreseeable future.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent  standard,  I  have  doubts  about
Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or
sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence  as  a  whole
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or  vice
versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he has  not met his
ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  show  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a -- 1.i:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for
access to classified information. Eligibility denied.
