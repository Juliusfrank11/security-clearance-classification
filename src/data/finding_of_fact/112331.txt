Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e, with explanations.
(Answer.) The allegations are supported by credit reports dated November 21, 2017, and
June 7, 2018. (Item 6; Item 7.)
Applicant is 23 years old. She is single and resides with her mother to save money.
She  was  enrolled  in  classes  from  June  2013  to  May  2014  at  a  university,  and  then
transferred to a college in October 2015. As of July 2016, she was still enrolled in classes
at the college. She worked part time as a clerk in a discount retail store from November
2014 to present. Prior to that, she was an unemployed student. (Reply; Answer; Item 4;
Item 7.)
Applicant is indebted on a lease agreement in the amount of $5,771, as stated in
SOR ¶ 1.a. This debt was for student housing while attending the university and became
delinquent  in  2014.  Initially,  she  did  not  realize  that  this  loan  was  separate  from  her
student-loan accounts addressed below. However, when she realized it was a separate
debt, she contacted this creditor and set up an arrangement to pay $150 monthly until
this debt is resolved. She provided the name of her point of contact and a phone number
to verify her payments under the agreement. While she did not provide documentation of
payments under this agreement, she appears to be resolving this debt. (Reply.)
Applicant is indebted on three student-loan accounts held by the same creditor in
the total amount of $10,547, as stated in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. These loans became
delinquent  in  2016  and  2017.  Applicant  entered  into  a  repayment  agreement  with  this
creditor to resolve these delinquencies through monthly payments of $149. She did not
establish a repayment agreement until after receiving the SOR, because she originally
thought that he mother was repaying this debt. She documented that she has made six
monthly payments according to this agreement. These debts are being resolved. (Reply;
Item 7.)
Applicant was indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $369, as stated
in SOR ¶ 1.c. This was a credit card account that became delinquent in 2016. Applicant
settled this debt for less than the balance due, as documented in a May 2018 letter from
this creditor. It is resolved. (Item 3.)
Applicant is addressing her delinquent debts as best she can with the funds that
she  has  available.  She  lives  “paycheck  to  paycheck”  but  is  dedicated  to  resolving  her
debts in full. (Reply.)
