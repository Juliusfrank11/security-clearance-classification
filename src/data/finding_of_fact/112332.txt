Applicant is a 32-year-old firearms instructor, employed by a defense contractor
since  January  2017.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  2004.  He  married  in  2005  and
divorced in 2007, and has one 11-year-old child. He served in the Army National Guard
from 2003 until being honorably discharged in 2009. Applicant held a security clearance
from 2004 to 2009.
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  is  delinquent  on  three  debts  totaling  approximately
$40,000; defaulted on a mortgage and the home was foreclosed in 2013; and failed to file
Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016. The SOR allegations
are  supported  by  substantial  evidence.  Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  with
explanations.
Applicant’s financial problems began after he divorced in 2007. He incurred sole
responsibility for a child-support obligation, home mortgage and other expenses. He was
unable  to  make  the  mortgage  payments,  defaulted  in  about  2008  and  the  home  was
foreclosed  in  2013.  (SOR  ¶  1.f)  No  deficiency  is  owed  and  his  credit  report  no  longer
shows the debt.
Other debts include a $39,633 car loan that was reported in his 2017 credit report
as $2,192 past-due. (SOR ¶ 1.c) Applicant stated that he used the loan payments to pay
for trips to visit his ill father from 2017 until he passed away in 2018. He testified that he
was  eight  months  behind  in  payments  and  owed  about  $32,000.  He  did  not  have  an
agreement to resolve the delinquent account. Applicant  claimed that he paid two small
debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e, in February or March 2017 with a debit card. No record
of the payments was submitted, but they are no longer reflected in his most current credit
report.
Applicant testified that he failed to file Federal and state income tax returns for tax
years 2015 to 2017 because of stress from a custody dispute with his ex-spouse, and
that he is waiting to accumulate sufficient funds to pay a tax lawyer or someone to assist
him, and to pay approximately $3,000 in taxes owed. He noted in testimony that he is
unfamiliar  with  how  to  file  delinquent  tax  returns  and  he  could  not  find  a  tax  preparer
outside of tax season, but admitted that he had not been diligent in that effort.
Applicant  earns  about  $80,000  per  year,  has  a  monthly  net  remainder  of  about
$800, and $1,000 in savings. He has not sought financial counseling.
Law and Policies
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484  U.S.  518, 528  (1988). As  Commander in  Chief,  the President  has  the  authority  to
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is  clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An
administrative  judge  must  consider  a  person’s  stability,  trustworthiness,  reliability,
discretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG ¶ 1(b).
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the
possible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant
has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the  President  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  have
established for issuing a clearance.
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the
personal or professional history  of  the applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant from
being  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information.  The  Government  has  the  burden  of
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. “Substantial
evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. Washington
Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a
nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the  criteria  listed
therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3
(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015).
Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG ¶ 1(d).
