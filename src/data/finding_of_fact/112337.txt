After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  49  years  old.  He  has  been  employed  by  his  present  employer,  a
federal  contractor,  since  2005.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  of  science  in  business
management in October 2004. He has been married since 2000 and has two children,
ages  18  and  15.  He  enlisted  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  in  March  1988.  In  June  1991,  he
received a general discharge due to his marijuana use while in the military. (Items 4, 5)
Applicant was interviewed in September 2017 by an authorized DOD investigator
for  his  background  security  clearance  investigation.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he
began  using  marijuana  in  1986  while  he  was  in  high  school.  He  admitted  using
marijuana  on  approximately  three  occasions  while  he  was  in  the  military.  Since  his
discharge from the military in 1991, he admitted that he continued to smoke marijuana
on a monthly basis to the present time. Prior to October 2015, Applicant would purchase
marijuana  from  an  individual’s  home.  Since  October  2015,  he  obtained  a  medical
marijuana card and now purchases his marijuana from the dispensary, since it is legal
to  do  so  in  his  state.  Applicant  admitted  he  falsified  his  drug  answers  on  the  SCA
because  he  was  afraid  the  information  would  have  an  adverse  impact  on  his  security
clearance.  Applicant  stated  that  he  no  longer  plans  to  use  marijuana  because  he now
has no desire to use it. (Item 9)
On  the  2005  SCA,  Applicant  only  disclosed  marijuana  use  in  March  1990.  He
intentionally failed to disclose his current use of marijuana, and that he used cocaine in
at least 2000. Applicant voluntarily entered treatment in 2000 due to his use of cocaine,
but  he  did  not  disclose  that  information  either.  On  the  2016  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed
that he used marijuana in the military, and he disclosed his voluntary treatment in 2000
for  his  use  of  cocaine.  Applicant  intentionally  failed  to  disclose  his  current  use  of
marijuana, to include after he was granted a DOD security clearance in January 2007.
(Items 4, 5)
The  DOD  investigator  also  questioned  Applicant  about  the  delinquent  accounts
he listed on his 2016 SCA. Applicant stated that beginning in about December 2010, he
could  no  longer  afford  to make  regular payments  on  these financial  accounts  after  his
spouse had her hours reduced by her employer. Applicant admitted that he has not paid
any  of  his  delinquent  creditors.  He  was  currently  doing  research  into  the  possibility  of
consolidating his delinquent debt, but he had not yet taken any action to do so. (Item 9)

disclose  that  he  had  used  marijuana  within  the  last  seven  years,  and  he  deliberately
failed to divulge he had continued to use marijuana after he had been granted a DOD
security  clearance  in  January  2007.  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation  in  his  SOR
response. (Items 1, 3)
