Applicant  is  a  52-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  retain  a  security
clearance.  He  works  as  a  consultant  in  the  fields  of  proposal  management,  capture
management, and business development for various companies in the defense industry.
(Tr.  18-19;  Exhibit  C)  His  formal  education  includes  a  bachelor’s  degree  from  a
prestigious  private  university.  He  married  in  1999,  and  he  and  his  spouse  have  two
teenage children from the marriage.
The  SOR  alleged  and  Applicant  admitted  a  history  of  financial  problems.  In
addition  to  his  admissions,  the  six  delinquent  financial  accounts  in  the  SOR  are
established  by  the  documentary  evidence.  (Exhibits  3-8)  In  particular,  the  SOR
concerns  a  past-due  mortgage  loan  in  the  amount  of  $3,890  with  a  total  balance  of
$948,215, and five charged-off accounts in the total amount of about $64,433. Three of
the  charged-off  accounts  are  credit  card  accounts,  and  two  charged-off  accounts  are
unsecured loans from peer-to-peer lending companies.
financial  problems
In  general,  Applicant  attributed  his
to  circumstances
surrounding his wife’s mental-health condition (bipolar disorder) in 2016, and a business
downturn in 2017 due to the transition of presidential administrations, leaving delays in
large  government  procurement  programs.  His  wife’s  mental-health  condition  is  long-
standing; the first undiagnosed manic episode occurred in 2007-2008; and she was first
diagnosed  with  bipolar  disorder  and  had  court-ordered  treatment  in  2011.  (Tr.  53-54)
Her most recent manic episode was in 2016. Her condition has stabilized since the last
episode with no further incidents, and she remains under the care of a psychiatrist. (Tr.
43-44)
The  2016  episode  resulted  in,  among  other  things,  Applicant  and  his  wife
entering  into  a  written  partial  marital  settlement  agreement  in  April  2016.  (Exhibit  AA)
The agreement summarized the relevant circumstances surrounding his wife’s mental-
health condition as follows:
WHEREAS,  the  Wife  has  been  hospitalized  several  times  during  the
parties’ marriage which has resulted in periods of marital separation, and it
appears  that  in  order  for  the  parties  to  continue  their  marriage  and  to
continue to  reside  in the  same  residence and  to  protect  the  safety  of  the
children, the parties have agreed that a marital agreement is necessary for
them  to  live  together  as  husband  and  wife.  Specifically,  [Applicant’s
spouse]  suffers  from  significant  mental  illness.  To  date,  she  has  been
hospitalized  (involuntarily  and/or  voluntarily)  four  (4)  times  since  2011.
This includes four (4) court supervised hospitalizations and multiple court
supervised  medical  treatment  plans.  Manic  attacks  preceded  each  of
these  hospitalizations,  and
law  enforcement/crisis  prevention
authorities deemed her to be a possible danger to herself or others. In two
(2) of these hospitalizations,  different medical  teams  have  diagnosed her
as having Bi-polar disorder with manic tendencies.

damaged/attempted to destroy personal property belonging to her family.
For  example,  in  2011,  she  destroyed  office  equipment  used  by  her
husband  and  attempted  to  give  away  family  possessions  (including
valuable  jewelry). And  in  2013,  she  locked  out  her husband and  children
from  their  family  home  during  another  manic  attack.  Also,  on  or  about  in
2008/2009,  she  also  locked  out  her  husband  from  the  family  home  until
local  law  enforcement  were  able  to  gain  access  to  the  house  for  the
husband.
During  manic  attacks,  [Applicant’s  spouse]  has  shown  disregard  for  the
safety of family financial assets. For example, in 2011 she wrote a check
for $100,000 on the family account which if cashed would have bounced.
In  2011,  she  also  tried  to  give  away  assets  of  the  family  to  realize  a
delusional vision of good fortune. And in 2013, she emptied out joint bank
accounts,  which  created  a  dangerous  situation  for  the  husband  and
children who were at that point outside the home area. (Exhibit AA at 1-2)
Among  other  things,  Applicant  and  his  wife  agreed  that  he  has  sole  legal  and
physical custody of their minor children and his wife had liberal access to the children so
long as she remains in the marital home. His wife agreed to continue treatment, follow
all doctor’s recommendations, and take all prescribed medications. She also agreed to
have no further contact with a named paramour or any subsequent paramour and cease
all contact, direct or indirect, with such persons. Applicant and his wife also agreed that
they will have one joint checking or savings account with a particular bank and all other
joint accounts will be closed.
Irresponsible  spending  was  a  feature  of  Applicant’s  wife’s  manic  episodes.  The
indebtedness  reflected  in  the  five  charged-off  accounts  in  the  SOR  stems  from  her
irresponsible spending with three credit card accounts, spending to pay for medical care
and  treatment  for  her,  or  both.  Applicant  has  taken  steps  to  reduce  the  likelihood  of
recurrence  of  a  similar  event.  (Tr.  46-47)  To  address  the  irresponsible  spending,
Applicant and his wife have one joint account, which allows him to monitor ongoing cash
flow, and he has taken her off of all his business accounts. (Tr. 48-50) Together, they
have three bank accounts with the same bank; she has her own checking account; they
have a joint account; and he has an account for household expenses. (Tr. 50) Most of
the money is in the household account, which she does not have access to while he has
access  and  transparency  for all  three  accounts.  (Tr.  50-51)  In  addition  to  the  financial
accounts, his spouse does not have access to matters related to his work in the defense
industry. (Tr. 63-64)
Turning  to  the  delinquent  debts  in  the  SOR,  the  first  concerns  the  past-due
mortgage loan for a home in their state of current residence. Applicant fell behind on the
loan  due  to  a  tenant  defaulting  on  his  rental  obligation  while  Applicant  and  his  family
were living and working in another state during 2014-2017. (Tr. 25-32) The tenant made
two payments on a 24-month lease before defaulting and eventual eviction. In addition
to  the  lack  of  a  monthly  rental  payment,  which  was  used  to  cover  the  mortgage
payment,  the  tenant  damaged  the  property  to  an  extent  that  the  cost  to  repair  and
rehabilitate the home was about $40,000.
In  April  2018,  Applicant  entered  into  a  repayment  plan  agreement  for  the
mortgage  loan,  which  then  was  past  due  in  the  amount  of  $12,028,  with  a  payment
schedule calling for six monthly payments ending in September 2018. (Exhibit M)
In October 2018, the mortgage lender agreed to extend the plan for another six
months  ending  in  March  2019.  (Exhibit  W)  As  of  October  2018,  the  past-due  amount
was $5,376.
A  November  16,  2018  account  statement  reflects  the  following:  (1)  the  amount
due  on  December  1,  2018,  was  $16,043;  (2)  the  unpaid  principal  balance  was
$905,116;  (3)  past  payments  year-to-date  include  $12,994  in  principal,  $13,685  in
interest, $9,174 in escrow, and $2,668 in unapplied funds, for a total of $38,552; and (4)
the  current  amount  due  consisted  of  $1,463  in  principal,  $1,501  in  interest,  $1,127  in
escrow for a monthly payment of $4,092, plus a past-due amount of $11,951. (Exhibit Z)
A  December  8,  2018  account  statement  shows  an  unpaid  principal  balance  of
$903,661  with  a  past-due  balance  of  $12,059.  (Exhibit  Y)  Applicant  anticipates  the
mortgage loan will be current by approximately March 2019. (Tr. 31)
Turning  next  to  the  charged-off  accounts,  the  $23,957  charged-off  credit  card
account  was  settled  in  2017,  when  Applicant  agreed  to  make  two  payments  totaling
$13,954,  and  a  pending  collection  lawsuit  against  Applicant  was  dismissed  with
prejudice in early 2018. (Tr. 32-36; Exhibit N)
The $17,051 charged-off credit card account was settled in 2017, when Applicant
agreed  to  make  12  monthly  payments  of  $1,222  ending  in  October  2018  for  a  full
settlement amount of $14,675. (Tr. 36-37; Exhibits O and U)
The  $13,323  charged-off  unsecured  loan  was  settled  in  2018,  when  Applicant
agreed  to  make  three  payments  for  a  total  of  $4,000  ending  in  May  2018.  (Tr.  38-39;
Exhibit P)
The  $8,866  charged-off  unsecured
loan  was  resolved  by  a  repayment
arrangement calling for $100 monthly payments beginning in October 2017. (Tr. 39-41;
Exhibits Q and V) The account has not been settled for a lesser amount, and Applicant
intends to adhere to the payment arrangement until the account is paid.
The $1,236 charged-off credit card account was settled in November 2017 for a
lump-sum  payment  of  $1,512,  and  a  pending  collection  lawsuit  against  Applicant  was
dismissed with prejudice in early 2018. (Tr. 37-38; Exhibit R)
Applicant is a high-earner, averaging about $20,000 monthly in billable revenue.
(Tr. 42)  A self-prepared financial statement shows the following: (1) monthly income of
$15,000; (2) monthly expenses of $8,090; (3) monthly debt payments of $3,332; and (4)
a  monthly  net  remainder  of  $3,578;  and  listed  assets  (excluding  real  estate)  of
$263,000. (Exhibits K and S) In addressing his indebtedness to recover from the 2016
incident,  Applicant  has  followed  a  four-step  plan:  (1)  relocating  to  their  current  home
and  state  of  residence  in  mid-2017,  which  resulted  in  a  reduced  cost-of-living;  (2)
focusing  on  the  key  accounts  to  obtain  settlements;  (3)  establishing  a  three-month
financial reserve, which is still a work in progress; and (4)  paying off their current debt
by the spring of 2020, all of which would result in a full recovery. (Tr. 41-42) In addition
to  the  above  matters,  Applicant  had  credit  counseling  from  a  consumer  credit
counseling organization in April 2018. (Exhibit J)
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
1  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S.  518,  528  (1988)  (“it  should  be  obvious  that  no  one  has  a
‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no
right to a security clearance).
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the  burden  of  proof  is  less  than  a  preponderance  of  evidence.3  The  DOHA  Appeal
Board  has  followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s findings  of  fact  are  reviewed
under the substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.6
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
2 484 U.S. at 531.
3 484 U.S. at 531.
4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).
5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).
6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶¶ E3.1.14 and E3.1.15.
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;
AG  ¶  20(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  a  death,  divorce,  or
separation,  clear  victimization  by  predatory  lending  practices,  or  identity
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.  The
disqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.
Turning  to  the  matters in  mitigation,  Applicant’s  financial  problems  are  due  to  a
combination  of  factors:  (1)  his  wife’s  last  manic  episode  in  2016,  her  related
irresponsible  spending,  and  expenses  for  her  care  and  treatment;  (2)  the  business
downturn  in  2017;  and  (3)  the  tenant  who  defaulted  on  the  lease  and  damaged  their
home  while  they  were  living  and  working  in  another  state.  Those  circumstances  were
largely  beyond  his  control.  Applicant  acted  responsibly  under  the  circumstances,  as
evidenced by the remedial actions taken in 2017 and 2018 to address his indebtedness.
He  also  acted  responsibly  by  taking  steps  to  rehabilitate  his  marriage  and  care for his
spouse,  protect  his  minor  children,  and  prevent  his  spouse  from  engaging  in  further
irresponsible spending. Given the circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG ¶ 20(b)
applies in Applicant’s favor.
Applicant  has  initiated  and  is  adhering  to  a  good-faith  effort  to  resolve  his
indebtedness.  He  receives  substantial  credit  for  addressing  all  the  debts  in  the  SOR.
The past-due mortgage loan is still past due, but Applicant has paid tens of thousands
of dollars on the loan during 2017-2018, and he anticipates being current on the loan by
March  2019.  He  also  paid  a  total  of  $34,141  to  settle  four  of  the  five  charged-off
accounts,  and  he  is  making  monthly  payments  per  a  repayment  arrangement  for  the
other.  Moreover,  it  does  not  appear  that  Applicant  was  slow  to  act.  He  has  being
working  on  these  matters  since  the  mid-2017  relocation  to  his  state  of  current
residence.  Given  the  circumstances,  the  mitigating  condition  at  AG  ¶  20(d)  applies  in
Applicant’s favor.
Applicant presented a good but less than perfect case in mitigation, but, as in all
human  affairs,  perfection  is  not  the  standard.  A  security  clearance  case  is not  a  debt-
collection  procedure.  It  is  a  procedure  designed  to  evaluate  an  applicant’s  judgment,
reliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010).
An  applicant  is  not  required,  as  a  matter  of  law,  to  establish  resolution  of  every  debt
alleged  in  the  SOR.  An  applicant  need  only  establish  a  plan  to  resolve  the  financial
problems  and  take  significant  actions  to  implement  the  plan.  There  is  no  requirement
that  an  applicant  make  payments  on  all  the  delinquent  debts  simultaneously,  nor  is
there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No.
07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).
Here, I am persuaded that Applicant  is making an honest effort to be financially
responsible and repay his creditors. He’s not running from or avoiding his debts. There
are clear indications that he is repaying his creditors, and his financial problems appear
to  be under control. With  additional time  coupled  with  his ability  as  a  high-earner, it  is
probable  that  he  will  continue  to  make  the  required  mortgage  loan  payments  and
adhere to the repayment arrangement for the unresolved charged-off account. It is also
probable  that  he  will  meet  his  financial  goal  of  full  recovery  by  spring  2020.  Taking
everything  into  account,  Applicant  demonstrated  good  judgment,  reliability,  and
trustworthiness by persevering under difficult and trying circumstances that were largely
beyond his control. The financial considerations concern is mitigated.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent  standard,  I  have  no  doubts  about
Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or
sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence  as  a  whole
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or  vice
versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he met his ultimate
burden  of  persuasion  to  show  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to
grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:
For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a--1.f:
For Applicant
Conclusion
It  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  interests  of  national  security  to  grant  Applicant
eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility granted.
