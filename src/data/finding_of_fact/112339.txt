In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted misuse of prescription drugs as
alleged under ¶ 1.a.
Applicant is 38 years old. She married in May 2015 and gave birth to a daughter
on  August  26,  2017.  She  has  owned  her  home  since  March  2011.  In  May  2003,
Applicant  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  history;  in  August  2004,  she  earned  a
master’s degree in cultural studies; and in May 2009, she was awarded a law degree.
From 2009 to September 2010, she clerked for a federal district court judge. She was a
law  firm  associate for three  years before  landing  her current  job  in  2014  where  she  is
presently a senior contract attorney. She is a member of two state bars. Applicant has
never  been  investigated  or  held  a  security  clearance.  She  has  no  criminal  record  and
the only drug she has used in her life is Adderall. (GE 1 at 9-14, 22, 69, 72; GE 2 at 16;
AE B; AE C; AE F; AE G; AE N at 2-3; AE O)
In her October 2016 PSI, Applicant indicated she used Adderall about two times
a  month  beginning  in  January  2016,  when  she  was  34  years  old.  The  controlled
substance  was  prescribed  to  her  brother  for  his  attention  deficit  disorder.  She  began
taking the drug to curb her appetite. She indicated that the drug never had an adverse
effect  on  her  judgment,  her  work,  or  her  finances.  She  informed  the  OPM  investigator
that she intended to continue using the drug unless required to stop to obtain a security
clearance. (GE 2 at 16)
In her interrogatory answers dated and notarized on February 9, 2018, Applicant
noted  several  minor  changes  in  her  October  2016  PSI.  She  then  disclosed  that  her
daughter was born in August 2017. She also indicated that she used Adderall about 30
times from January 2016 to February 9, 2018. (GE 2 at 1-5, 16)
Though  not  mentioned  in  her  October  2016  PSI  or  her  February  2018
interrogatory  answers,  she  informed  a  licensed  clinical  social  worker  (LCSW)  in  April
2019  that  during  her  pregnancy  and  nursing  of  her  daughter  from  December  2016  to
approximately February 2018, she used no Adderall. (AE N at 2-3)
The LCSW conducted a full evaluation of Applicant in April 2019. For part of the
evaluation, she administered the drug assessment screening test (DAST) to Applicant.
She  conducted an  examination using  the  11-point  screening  criteria  of  Diagnostic  and
Statistical  Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). She  conducted  a  mental status  exam
followed  by  a  clinical  interview.  After  referencing  the  AGs  for  security  clearance
eligibility  and  reviewing  the  pertinent  sections  of  the  DSM-5,  the  LCSW  diagnosed
Applicant as having no substance abuse disorder. (AE N at 1-4)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  explained  that  her obesity  was  the  reason  she  started
using Adderall in January 2016. Over the next several months, she lost 70 pounds and
became pregnant in December 2016. She indicated that she did not use Adderall during
her  pregnancy  (December  2016  to  August  2017)  and  while  she  was  nursing  her
daughter for the next four months. Applicant resumed her Adderall use in January 2018
because she wanted to lose weight again, a decision she regrets. She discontinued use
in  February  2018  “because  that’s  when  I  received  the  Government’s  Statement  of
Reasons.”  (Tr. 33) (She  is mistaken as  the SOR  was  not  issued until March 1, 2018.)
Applicant did not know the drug was a controlled substance until a later date. (SOR; Tr.
22-28; 33)
The circumstances in Applicant’s life have changed since the birth and nursing of
her daughter. She is no longer trying to lose weight to achieve pregnancy. She pledged
not to use Adderall or another person’s prescription drugs in the future. Applicant’s six
drug  tests  from  October  2018  through  March  2019  registered  negative  results.  On
December 11, 2018, she signed a statement of intent to abstain from future misuse of
prescription drugs, realizing that future misuse of prescription medication is grounds for
revocation of national security eligibility. (Tr. 22-28; AE L; AE M)
In November 2018, Applicant’s treating psychiatrist recalled that that she told him
in August 2016 she was using Adderall though he was unable to conclude “during that
time”  or  “since  that  time”  that  she  was  addicted  to  the  drug.  Applicant’s  weight  loss
doctor, who she has been consulting occasionally for four years,  discouraged her from
using Adderall. She has never tried to obtain a prescription for the drug from a medical
professional.  She  has  had  some  success  with  other  prescribed  weight-loss  drugs,  but
stopped using one of those drugs because of the risk of birth defects. (Tr. 31-33, 35-38;
AE K)
Applicant selected Adderall to control her appetite because somehow she knew
the  drug  could  subdue  hunger  desires  and  she  was  aware  her  brother  had  a
prescription for the drug. She did not know if the drug had any side effects or a negative
influence on her fertility. (Tr. 36-37, 42-43)
Applicant’s  fear  of  not  being  granted  a  security  clearance  was  one  reason  she
stopped  using  Adderall.  However,  when  she  received  the  SOR  labeling  her a  national
security concern, she knew she had to strengthen her resolve for continued abstinence
from Adderall misuse or misuse of another’s prescription drugs. (Tr. 37)
Character Evidence
Applicant’s colleague (Mr. R3) at her current employer testified that he has been
working with Applicant for three years. In his daily contact with her, he has found her to
be very professional and a trustworthy attorney. Applicant expressed her remorse to Mr.
R3 for having used Adderall that was prescribed to her brother. She was trying to lose
weight so that she could become pregnant. (Tr. 11-19)
Applicant submitted nine character references. A program manager (Mr. R1) has
known Applicant since 2011 because they worked together on government contracts at
a  law  firm  until she  accepted  her present  job  in  2014.  Applicant’s professionalism and
trustworthiness  is  based  on  Mr.  R1’s  regular  interaction  with  her.  Mr.  R2  has  known
Applicant  for  nine  years  and  believes  that  she  is  a  diligent  worker.  Mr.  R3,  corporate
counsel  who  testified  at  the  hearing,  indicated  that  Applicant  is  involved  in  a
neighborhood  charity  that  provides  scholarships  to  worthy  candidates  from  the  area.
(AE H; AE J)
Mr.  R4,  a  contractor,  has  known  Applicant  professionally  and  socially  for  four
years.  He  believes  she  is  a  knowledgeable  member  of  the  government  contractor
community. Ms. R5 has known Applicant since they were in law school in 2006. Ms. R5
and  Applicant  have  maintained  friendship  over  the  years.  Mr.  R6,  an  associate  law
school  professor,  was  a  law  clerk  with  Applicant  in  2009.  They  have  remained  friends
with Mr. R6 and Applicant socializing often. (AE H)
Mr. R7, who has known Applicant for five years, worked with her for a period of
time at her current employer. He found her to be honest, dedicated, and a team player.
Mr.  R8,  currently  a  police  officer,  worked  with  Applicant  at  her  employer’s  industrial
security office. He personally observed her trustworthiness and high caliber of her work
product. (AE H)
Mrs. R9, a lawyer, has known Applicant since 2012, when Mrs. R9 was hired at a
contracts law firm, and Applicant was assigned to be her adviser. Applicant’s mentoring
helped Mrs. R9 manage her time  more  effectively  and  stimulate  her  professional
development.  Applicant  is an  honest  person,  a  responsible  wife,  and  attentive  mother.
(AE H) None of the nine glowing character endorsements, not even the reference from
Mr. R3, make any reference to Applicant’s misuse of prescription drugs.
