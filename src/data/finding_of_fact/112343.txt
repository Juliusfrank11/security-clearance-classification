Applicant is a 47-year-old lab manager currently employed by a defense contractor
since October 2010. He has worked as a defense contractor and held a security clearance
since 1996. He has worked as a first responder since 1998 and is now a sergeant in the
county rescue squad. He has been awarded numerous commendations for his volunteer
service, including two citations from the state General assembly. (AX G.) Applicant and
his wife married in 1995. (GX 1.)
Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  alleges  eight  past-due  accounts  totaling  $29,492.
Applicant admits seven of the accounts and denies the $1,243 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h.
The delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant’s credit bureau reports (CBR) from April
2018, December 2017, and February 2017. (GX 2; GX 3; GX 4.)
Applicant  and  his  wife  historically  struggled  financially  due  to  low-paying  jobs.
Applicant worked for his previous employer from 1996 until 2010. He started as an hourly
employee  earning  $5.90  per  hour.  By  2010,  Applicant  had  worked  his  way  up  to  the
position of lab manager where he earned $27 per hour, grossing approximately $56,000
annually.  Applicant’s  wife  previously  worked  for  the  same  employer,  at  a  lower  hourly
rate, until she was laid off in 2010. She was unemployed for approximately six months,
until beginning part-time work for the contractor who employs Applicant. This period of
unemployment and underemployment created financial strains for Applicant’s household
prompting Applicant to sell his vehicle to help make ends meet. (Tr. 64-65.) Applicant’s
wife has since gained full-time employment. Applicant and his wife earn a combined gross
salary of approximately $130,000, of which Applicant earns approximately $86,000. (Tr.
38-40; Tr. 42-43.)
Applicant’s  most  recent  financial  issues  arose  from  unanticipated  financial
demands.  Applicant’s  mother,  who  lived  in  Florida,  died  in  2014.  The  obligation  of
wrapping up his mother’s affairs fell to Applicant. He had to make multiple trips to Florida,
and  incurred  travel-related  expenses.  Because  he  was  frequently  away  from  home,
Applicant’s  wife  took  over  the  responsibility  of  managing  the  household  finances.  She
was  inexperienced  at  handling  the  accounting  and  was  delinquent  in  paying  several
accounts. (Tr. 21.)
Following Applicant’s mother’s death, his father became overwhelmed. Applicant
provided financial as well as emotional support to his father. Within months of his mother’s
death,  Applicant’s  mother-in-law  was  stricken  with  cancer.  She  was  no  longer  able  to
perform her job. Applicant’s father-in-law’s income was unreliable. Applicant and his wife
provided financial support for her mother. (Tr. 22-23.) Applicant and his wife are no longer
financially supporting any family members. (Tr. 56-58; Tr. 70-72.)
Applicant and his wife incurred significant medical expenses between 2008 and
2009.  During  this  period,  it  was  also  discovered  that  Applicant’s  wife  had  cancer  that
subsequently required extensive surgery and treatments. They primarily used a dedicated
credit card to pay the medical expenses. (Tr. 44-46.) The account first became delinquent
in 2013 and has since been charged off in the amount of $11,065. (SOR ¶ 1.a). Applicant
also took two personal loans through this same creditor which have since been charged
off in the amounts of $2,091 and $1,901 as alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g. Since 2016,
Applicant made sporadic payments to this creditor, usually in increments of $50. Applicant
entered  a  repayment agreement  with  this creditor  in  March  2019 which  addresses the
three  delinquent  accounts.  The  creditor  automatically  withdraws  $250  a  month  from
Applicant’s checking account. (Tr. 45-46; AX C; AX D.) These debts are being resolved.
In  2012,  Applicant  returned  to  college.  In  order  to  finance  his  tuition  and  other
expenses, Applicant took out several student loans. These loans became delinquent and
Applicant was past-due $304 (SOR ¶ 1.b), $386 (SOR ¶ 1.c), and $153 (SOR ¶ 1.d). The
creditor consolidated loans and Applicant has made sporadic payments since 2014 and
increasingly  since  2016.  His  current  balance  is  approximately  $36,000.  Applicant  has
been in discussions with the creditor in an effort to negotiate a monthly payment that is
financially manageable for Applicant. The creditor is currently requiring a $2,000 lump-
sum  payment,  which  will  be  followed  by  monthly  payments  of  $226.  In  the  interim,
Applicant has continued making payments whenever he is able. (Tr. 26-28.) These debts
are being resolved.
The $3,362 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e was for a credit account with a computer
company where Applicant purchased a computer in about 2015. Applicant did not realize
that  this  account  was  delinquent.  The  original  creditor  sold  the  account  to  a  collection
agency that Applicant did not recognize as one of his creditors. However, he made a $50
payment to a collection agency. (AX C.) In March 2019, Applicant entered a repayment
agreement  with  the  monthly  payment  of  $44  that  is  debited  directly  from  Applicant’s
checking account by the creditor. (AX A.) This debt is being resolved.
Applicant denies the $1,243 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h. The debt was owed for
tuition for a college course that Applicant dropped. The debt was resolved in 2014 when
the state withheld Applicant’s tax refund. The debt has not appeared on Applicant’s CBRs
since February 2017. (GX 4.) This debt is resolved.
Applicant and his wife purchased the land on which their house stands in 1996 and
built their house in 2006. Their mortgage-loan payment is $1,244 a month and is current.
Their  second  mortgage-loan  payment  is  $942  month,  which  is  also  current.  Applicant
recently made his final $810 payment for his vehicle and now has title. Applicant’s wife’s
car is paid off. Applicant lives within his means, to include the expenses for two dogs with
chronic health issues. Applicant’s second mortgage loan will be paid off in 2021 and his
primary mortgage loan will be paid off in 2025. Applicant purchased a recreational vehicle
for  $18,000  in  approximately  2016  using  a  401(k)  loan.  He  is  current  with  his  loan
payments  of  $40  per  pay  period.  Applicant  has  approximately  $3,000  in  his  checking
account and approximately $60,000 in his 401(k). (Tr. 62; Tr. 59.) Applicant intends to
use the $810 a month that was previously allotted for his truck payment to make payments
on his other outstanding accounts. (Tr. 72-73.)
Applicant  did  not  understand  the  potential  security  significance  of  financial
delinquencies  until  his  2017  personal  subject  interview  (PSI).  Upon  realizing  the
importance  of  resolving  any  and  all  the  delinquent  accounts,  Applicant  contacted  his
creditors and began making sporadic payments on his accounts when he was able. (AX
B; Tr. 70-71.) Applicant now maintains a spreadsheet with the tickler system to alert him
to when bills are due for payment. (Tr. 70-72; Tr. 62.)  In the event that Applicant changes
employers, he is eligible to cash out his unused leave which totals more than 360 hours.
He would use this money to pay down any remaining debts. (AX D.) Applicant has not
incurred any recent delinquent debts. He was sincere and credible while testifying.
Applicant’s current direct supervisor of more than four years states that Applicant
has an amazing work ethic and that he is loyal, trustworthy, and an asset to the team.
She further states that he demonstrates integrity and that he should be granted access
to  classified  information.  Another  of  Applicant’s  supervisors,  who  frequently  travels
officially with Applicant, states that Applicant should be granted a clearance and that he
demonstrates  loyalty,  trustworthiness,  and  integrity.  (AX  H.)  Applicant  received
outstanding performance appraisals in 2017 and 2018. (AX E; AX F.)
