Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  through  1.j,  and  she  denied
SOR ¶ 1.a. She is 34 years old. She has never married. She has three children, ages
14, 8, and 7.1
Applicant graduated from high school in 2003. As of the date of the hearing, she
was  attending  college  and  expected  to  receive  her  bachelor’s  degree  in  2022.  She
worked for a previous employer, a DOD contractor, from 2015 to 2016. She has worked
for her current employer, a DOD contractor, since July 2016. She became a team lead
medical  appointment  coordinator  in  August  2017.  She  was  unsure  whether  she  has
ever had access to sensitive information.2
Applicant  attributed  her  delinquent  debts  to  losing  her  job,  in  which  she  earned
$20,000 annually, in August 2009, when she was pregnant with her second child. She
was subsequently unemployed three times: from August 2009 to December 2012, May
2013  to  September  2014,  and  July  to  October  2015.  During  these  periods,  she  only
received limited state unemployment benefits twice. She was otherwise underemployed,
until  she  obtained  a  job  with  a  DOD  contractor  in  2015.  She  is  also  a  single  parent,
though  she  receives  assistance  from  her  eldest  child’s  father.  She  attributed  her
delinquent debt in SOR ¶ 1.a to her stolen identity, discussed further below.3
The  SOR  alleges  seven  delinquent  consumer  debts  totaling  $22,551  (SOR  ¶¶
1.a-1.d,  1.h.-1.j),  two  delinquent  student  loans  totaling  $6,215  (SOR  ¶¶  1.e-1.f),  and  a
$22 delinquent state overpayment debt (SOR ¶ 1.g). The debts are established by the
2016  credit  bureau  report.  The  2017  credit  bureau  report  only  reported  the  debts  in
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. Applicant also disclosed and discussed her debts in her 2016
security clearance application (SCA) and 2017 background interview.4

SOR  ¶  1.a  is  for  a  $1,247  wireless  cellular  account  placed  for  collection.
Applicant  testified  that  her  identity  was  stolen  and  used  to  open  this  account  in  her
name. She testified that the same thing happened to her mother. She indicated that she
disputed  this  debt  for  years  with  the  credit  reporting  agencies.  The  debt  was  not
reported on her April 2018 credit report. She indicated that she has a fraud alert on her
credit report as a result of the identity theft incident.5
SOR ¶ 1.b is for a $472 wireless cellular account placed for collection. Applicant
provided documentation reflecting that she paid this debt in March 2018.6
SOR  ¶  1.c  is  for  a  $153  cellular  account  placed  for  collection.  Applicant  co-
signed  this  account  for  an  ex-boyfriend.  Applicant  provided  documentation  reflecting
that she paid this debt in November 2017.7
SOR  ¶  1.d  is  for  a  $6,756  balance  due  for  a  voluntary  car  repossession,  and
SOR  ¶  1.h  is  for  a  $13,423  collection  account  by  the  same  creditor  as  SOR  ¶  1.d.
Applicant indicated that SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.h are duplicate accounts for the balance due
on  the  car  that  she  voluntarily  surrendered  in  August  2010,  after  she  had  lost  her  job
and  gave  birth  to  her  second  child.  She  testified  that  she  contacted  the  underlying
creditor, from whom she obtained the car loan, by telephone in approximately 2017, and
was  told  that  they  did  not  have  any  information  because  they  placed  the  account  for
collection. She testified that she then contacted the collection agency with the intention
of  making  payment  arrangements,  but  was  told  that  they  too  did  not  have  any
information  because  the  debt  was  older  than  seven  years.  She  indicated  that  she
attempted  to  obtain  documentation  from  the  creditor  reflecting  that  the  debts  were
duplicates, but she did not receive a timely response.8
SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f are for two student loans totaling $6,215 placed for collection.
Applicant testified that she obtained these loans when she went to school. She testified
that  her  tax  refunds  were  intercepted  and  applied  toward  the  loans,  and  she  paid  the
remaining  $100  balance  in  November  2016.  She  testified  that  she  was  able  to  obtain
financial  aid  to  finance  her  schooling  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing.  She  provided
documentation reflecting that both student loans were resolved as of December 2017.9
SOR  ¶  1.g  is  for  a  $22  state  unemployment  overpayment  placed  for  collection.
Applicant provided documentation reflecting that she paid this debt in November 2017.10

SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j are for two parking tickets totaling $500 placed for collection.
Applicant testified that she paid these tickets in around 2014 or 2015, and they are no
longer  reported  on  her  credit  report.  She  testified  that  she  registered  her  car  with  the
jurisdiction’s  department  of  motor  vehicles  (DMV)  in  2018,  and  she  provided
documentation  from  the  DMV  website  reflecting  that  she  would  not  have  been  able  to
do so if she had any outstanding tickets.11
Applicant  testified  that  she  has  been  promoted  twice  since  she  started  her
current job in July 2016. She earned $47,000 annually since August 2017, but suffered
a pay cut of $800 monthly in April 2018 due to a contractor change, which has impacted
her ability to pay her bills. As of the date of the hearing, she had fallen behind on her
rent of $1,095 monthly, as well as her gas and electric bill. However, she testified that
she  was  in  communication  with  her  landlord;  she  sought  energy  assistance  for  her
electric  bill;  and  she  was  current  on  her  $470  monthly  payments  for  her  car  she
purchased in February 2018, as well as her cellular bill. She was also looking for part-
time  jobs  to  supplement  her  income.  Her  2018  credit  report  does  not  reflect  any
delinquent  debts.  She  receives  budgeting  advice  from  her  mother,  but  she  has  not
otherwise received financial counseling.12
that  Applicant  was  responsible
Applicant’s director of operations at her current job describe her as an excellent
communicator, and an independent, organized, and detail-oriented worker. The director
wrote
for  supervising  10  medical  appointment
coordinators in her section, and she did so efficiently and in a manner that led them to
quickly become “subject matter experts” in their respective procedures and operations.
Applicant’s  supervisor  of  two  years  wrote  that  Applicant  is  a  valuable  asset,  and  her
contributions are mission-essential.13
