Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for

years. He attended college for a period without earning a degree. He is married with two
children, ages 23 and 17.1
Applicant has a history of financial problems, which he attributed primarily to his
wife losing her job in 2013. His mother and a sibling both passed away within the last
four  years.  He  also  admitted  that  he  “was  not  watching  the  shop  as  closely  as  [he]
should have and things got out of hand.”2

received  formal  financial  counseling,  but  he  has  hired  tax  professionals  to  help  him
address his tax problems.7
