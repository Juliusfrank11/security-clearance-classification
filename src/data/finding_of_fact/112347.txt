Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $22,158.40 for
six delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a – 1.f). SOR 1.a addressed a $3,409 delinquent
federal income tax debt for the 2015 tax year, and SOR 1.f addressed a $1,872 debt for
unpaid  state  personal  property  taxes  in  the  2015  tax  year.  The  remaining  allegations
addressed a total of $16,876 for four delinquent or past-due personal credit accounts. In
response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  all  but  SOR  1.e,  claiming  without  any
documentary support that he had paid that debt. (FORM, Item 1)
Under  Guideline  E,  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  intentionally  made  a
false official statement when he omitted from a July 2009 e-QIP the debts alleged at SOR
1.a  –  1.e  (SOR  2.a).  The  record  compiled  in  support  of  the  SOR  did  not  support  that
allegation.  As  provided  for  by  section  E3.1.13  of  the  Directive,  Department  Counsel
amended the SOR by withdrawing SOR 2.a. (FORM, Section III at 2) Accordingly, only
the issues raised under Guideline F were before me for decision.
All  of  the  SOR allegations  are  supported  by  Applicant’s admissions  to  the  SOR
(FORM, Item 1) and in statements he made during two personal subject interviews (PSI)
on  July  19  and  August  15,  2017.  Additionally,  the  information  presented  in  two  credit
reports (FORM, Items 4 and 5) and documents from the IRS (FORM, Item 6) and the tax
authority in the state where Applicant lives (FORM, Item 7) support the SOR allegations
under Guideline F. In addition to the facts thus established, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  a  27-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  for  whom  he  has
worked  since  March  2010.  Applicant’s  federal  income  tax  debt  arose  from  early

1 – 7).

withdrawal penalties from his 401k account to make a down payment on his home. The
funds he withdrew became taxable income that Applicant failed to declare on his 2015
income tax returns. (FORM, Item 3)
Applicant’s  state  property  tax  debt  is  actually  due  for  the  2016  tax  year,  not  for
2015  as  alleged  in  SOR  1.f.  Applicant  incurred  this  debt  for  not  paying  the  taxes
associated  with  his  mortgage.  His  taxes  and  insurance  were  not  bundled  with  the
mortgage  and  interest  payments  each  month.  The  record  does  not  contain  any
explanation of why Applicant did not pay his property taxes in 2016. (FORM, Ite 3)
During his PSIs, Applicant stated his intention to use his 2017 income tax refund,
along with a home equity loan, to resolve all of his outstanding debts. Applicant did not
submit,  either  with  his  response  to  the  SOR  or  by  responding  to  the  FORM,  any
information that shows he has acted to resolve any of his debts.
