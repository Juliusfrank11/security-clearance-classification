Applicant admitted  all of  the allegations with the exception of  SOR  ¶ 1.p, which
he denied. He is 53 years old, married since 1990, and he has two adult children.5
Applicant was born in Guyana. He immigrated with his family to the United States
at  age  six.  He  became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  2002.  He  graduated  from  high
school in 1982 and subsequently attended a technical school, but did not earn a degree.

5 Applicant’s response to the SOR; Tr. at 13-14, 49-50; GE 1; AE J.
He  worked  for  previous  DOD  contractors  from  2009  to  2017.  He  has  worked  for  his
current employer, a DOD contractor, since November 2017. He was first granted a DOD
security clearance in 2011.6
The  SOR  alleges  the  following  delinquent  accounts:  a  $25,789  federal  tax  lien
and  a  $5,303  state  tax  lien,  both  from  2018  (SOR  ¶¶  1.o-1.p);  five  consumer  debts
totaling $137,027 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, 1.k); and seven medical accounts totaling
$4,161  (SOR  ¶¶  1.g-1.j,  1.l-1.n).  The  SOR  also  alleges  two  mortgage  foreclosures  in
2016 and 2017 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.d). The debts and foreclosures are established by court
records and credit reports from 2016 and 2017. Applicant also disclosed his debts in his
2016 security clearance application (SCA).7
Applicant attributed his delinquent debts to his family’s moves, beginning in 2005,
from state A to state B to state C. He did not receive correspondence as a result of his
moves,  and  he  was  unaware  of  a  number  of  his  debts,  to  include  his  wife’s  medical
expenses, until he received the SOR.8
Three months after moving his family from state A to state B, Applicant moved to
state  C  because  he  was  unable  to  find  comparable  work  in  state  B.  He  subsequently
moved  his  family  to  state  C  when  it  became  too  difficult  for  them  to  live  apart.  They
initially rented, and then they bought a home in state C in 2007. He rented his home in
state B, but the tenants did not pay the equivalent of his monthly mortgage so he was
responsible for paying the difference.9
In 2008, the housing market crashed. In 2009, Applicant rented his first home in
state C and purchased another home in state C, because his first home was too small
for his family. He had three separate renters for his first home in state C; each of them
did not pay the equivalent of his monthly mortgage for that home, so he was responsible
for paying the difference. His last renters for his first home in state C eventually stopped
paying their rent.10
In  2011,  Applicant’s  tenants  moved  out  of  his  home  in  state  B,  and  he  was
responsible  for  the  mortgages  on  his  homes  in  both  states  B  and  C.  He  became
unemployed for approximately four to six months in 2014 or 2015, and he supported his
family  with  money  solely  from  his  savings  and  401k  retirement  plan.  In  approximately
October  2016,  Applicant’s  second  home  in  state  C  was  foreclosed,  and  Applicant’s

family moved back to their home in state B. He moved back to his first home in state C,
and that home was foreclosed in October 2017.11
Applicant  wife’s  medical  issues  started  in  approximately  1998,  after  the  birth  of
their  second  child.  Her  issues  progressively  worsened  over  the  years.  He  earned
approximately  $80,000  to  $90,000  annually  when  his  wife’s  medical  issues  began.
Though they have had health insurance, they incurred significant out-of-pocket costs for
the specialists his wife has seen over the years.12
SOR ¶ 1.a is for a mortgage account for the home Applicant owns in state B. The
account is $28,320 past due with a total loan balance of $391,740. He purchased this
home  in  2005  for  $365,000,  and  he  refinanced  it  several  months  later  for  $417,000.
Applicant  testified  that  he  completed  two  loan  modifications:  the  first  in  2007  or  2008,
when he was first delinquent on his mortgage, and the second in April 2018. During the
second  loan  modification  process,  the  initial  mortgage  holder  sold  the  account  to  the
current  mortgage  holder  and  the  $39,000  past-due  amount  was  forgiven.  He  provided
documentation,  executed  by  both  himself  and  his  mortgage  holder,  to  corroborate  his
claim.  His  total  loan  balance  was  $360,000,  for  which  he  was  paying  $3,100  monthly.
He  testified  that  he  made  a  total  of  four  to  five  monthly  mortgage  payments  between
April 2018 and the date of the hearing. He acknowledged that he was $6,000 to $9,000
delinquent on this mortgage.13
SOR ¶ 1.b is for an $83,301 charged-off home equity line of credit (HELOC) from
Applicant’s home in state B. He obtained the HELOC in approximately 2007, to pay for
his  family’s  moving  expenses  from  state  B  state  C.  He  also  used  $55,000  as  a  down
payment for his first home in state C. He testified that he made three to four payments
towards the HELOC, but stopped until he completed the first loan modification for SOR
¶  1.a. He became delinquent  on the HELOC in 2011. He testified that he worked  with
the Lexington Law Firm to verify the debt; he then made several monthly payments of
$250 towards the HELOC in accordance with a payment plan beginning in the summer
of  2018.  He  provided  documentation  reflecting  such  monthly  payments  from  June  to
November  2018.  He  acknowledged  that  he  missed  some  monthly  payments.  He
testified that the total balance remaining of the HELOC was approximately $81,000.14
SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.d  are  for  mortgage  accounts  that  were  foreclosed  in
approximately  October 2016  and  October  2017,  respectively,  after Applicant  defaulted
on both loans. SOR ¶ 1.c is the mortgage for his second home in state C, and SOR ¶
1.d is the mortgage for his first home in state C. He purchased his first home in state C
in 2007 for approximately $299,000. He moved out of his first home in 2009, when he

purchased  his  second  home  in  state  C  for  approximately  $409,000,  with  his  father-in-
law as a cosigner. His second home was foreclosed in approximately October 2016.15
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  in  the  process  of  a  loan  modification  when  his
second home was foreclosed, and he unsuccessfully attempted to settle the  mortgage
account when he contacted the creditor. He stayed in his second home in state C until
June 2017, when he then returned to live in his first home in state C. In October 2017,
his first home in state C was foreclosed. He lived in the home until December 2017. He
indicated  that  he  had  not  been  contacted  by  either  creditor  about  any  deficiency
balances  for  his  first  or  second  homes  in  state  C,  and  he  was  working  with  the
Lexington  Law  Firm  to  attempt  to  remove  both  mortgage  accounts  from  his  credit
report.16
SOR  ¶ 1.e is for a $21,761  charged-off  account.  Applicant  testified  that  he was
unsure  about  this  debt.  He  did  not  recall  having  a  credit  card  with  this  creditor  since
1992, and he did not realize that the indebtedness on the card was $21,000. He testified
that  he  was  working  with  the  Lexington  Law  Firm  to  validate  it.  If  the  account  is
validated, he intends to work out a payment plan with the creditor to resolve this debt.17
SOR  ¶  1.f  is  for  a  $3,195  charged-off  account.  Applicant  testified  that  he  was
also  working  with  the  Lexington  Law  Firm  to  validate  this  debt,  as  he  did  not  recall
having a credit card with this creditor since 2010.18
SOR ¶¶ 1.g to 1.j and 1.l through 1.n are for seven delinquent medical accounts
totaling  $4,161.  Applicant  testified  that  these  debts  are  a  result  of  his  wife’s  medical
issues,  as  previously  discussed.  He  contacted  a  debt-resolution  company,  Freedom
Debt Relief, to assist him with resolving his wife’s medical expenses once he saw them
reported on his credit report. He paid the medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n,
for which he testified that Freedom Debt Relief successfully negotiated a settlement. He
also testified that Freedom Debt Relief referred him to the Lexington Law Firm, who is
working to  validate the  remaining medical  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶ 1.h, 1.i,  and 1.j, before he
pays them.19
SOR  ¶  1.k  is  for  a  $450  charged-off  department-store  credit  card.  Applicant
testified that he was unaware of  this debt because he did not receive correspondence
from  the  creditor  due  to  his  family’s  various  moves.  He  worked  with  Freedom  Debt
Relief and paid this debt.20

SOR ¶ 1.o is for an August 2018 state tax lien of $5,303, and SOR ¶ 1.p is for a
September 2018 federal tax lien of  $25,789.  Applicant testified that  he has timely filed
all of his federal and state income tax returns. He indicated that the liens in SOR ¶¶ 1.o
and  1.p  are  for  outstanding  federal  and  state  taxes  for  tax  year  2016,  because  he
claimed  more  dependents  that  tax  year  so  that  he  could  receive  more  money  per
paycheck  to  apply  towards  his  debts.  He  testified  that  he  started  making  payments
towards his outstanding federal and state taxes, but stopped when he had to pay other
debts,  to  include  his  wife’s  medical  expenses.  He  testified  that  he  was  paying  his
outstanding federal taxes through a payment plan with the IRS in 2017, but he stopped
when he was locked out of his account. He testified that he was unaware that liens were
filed  against  him  until  he  received  the  amended  SOR.  He  was  going  to  verify  the
balance of his outstanding liens and then attempt to negotiate a payment plan to resolve
them. He was also going to adjust his withholdings, as he had not yet done so as of the
date of the hearing.21
Applicant’s gross monthly pay as of the date of the  hearing was between $6,000
and  $9,000.  He  previously  grossed  $4,000  to  $7,000  monthly  from  2014  to  2017.  He
has  approximately  $8,000  in  his  401k  retirement  plan  and  he  does  not  have  any
savings. His wife has not worked outside of the home since 1996.  His motorcycle was
repossessed  in  September  2018,  and  he  drives  a  rental  car  for  which  he  pays  $185
weekly. He pays $3,100 monthly for his home in state B where his family lives; he also
pays $500 monthly for a rental apartment in state C where he lives. His wife manages
the  family’s  finances.  While  he  initially  neglected  to  develop  a  budget,  he  provided
documentation  reflecting that  he  compiled  one.  He  acknowledged  that  there  are  times
when he finds himself with a monthly negative net remainder.22
Applicant  testified  that  he  began  working  with  Freedom  Debt  Relief  in
approximately 2015 to negotiate  settlements  and payment plans with  his creditors.  He
had  a  second  job  that  enabled  him  to  pay  Freedom  Debt  Relief  $1,012  monthly.  He
paused  his  payments  in  the  summer  of  2018  when  he  no  longer  had  the  second  job,
and he planned to resume payments once he obtained another. He testified that he has
been  working  with  the  Lexington  Law  Firm  since  approximately  2016  to  validate  his
debts,  and  he  pays  them  $99  monthly.  He  testified  that  he  has  not  received  financial
counseling.23
Applicant’s direct supervisor since November 2017 testified that he met Applicant
in 2011, when they worked together for another employer, and he recruited Applicant for
their  current  contract.  He  interacts  with  Applicant  daily.  He  was  aware  that  Applicant
had  significant financial concerns affecting  Applicant’s security  clearance, as  Applicant
disclosed  them  to  him  several  months  prior  to  the  hearing  date.  He  suggested  that
Applicant  seek  legal  assistance  for  his  financial  problems.  He  has  rated  Applicant’s
performance as successful. He described Applicant as trustworthy, “one  of  the  hardest

working people I’ve ever met in my life,” and an individual who has never exhibited any
questionable behavior.24
Applicant’s coworker since February 2018 testified that he met Applicant in 2012,
when they worked for a previous employer until 2014. He described their relationship as
primarily a professional one, but indicated that they also became personally acquainted
when they worked for their prior employer. He learned  in 2012  about Applicant’s wife’s
medical  issues,  and  testified  that  he  would  not  be  surprised  if  they  amassed  medical
bills  as  a  result.  He  testified  that  he  had  recently  learned  there  were  questions  about
possible financial stability  affecting  Applicant’s security  clearance,  but he  was unaware
of
the  amount  of  Applicant’s  financial  indebtedness.  He  described  Applicant’s
performance for their prior employer as superior. He testified that he had not witnessed
Applicant’s  performance  for  their  current  employer  because  he  works  in  a  different
department. He described Applicant’s work ethic as without question, and Applicant as
a trustworthy individual. Additional character references, to include previous coworkers,
described Applicant as a reliable and trustworthy individual.25
