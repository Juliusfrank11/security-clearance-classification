Applicant denied failing to timely file his state and Federal income tax returns as
alleged in the SOR, but admitted owing the Internal Revenue Service over $58,000 for
eight delinquent tax years. He is a 50-year-old senior administrative associate employed
by  a  U.S.  defense  contractor  since  January  2007.  He  has  been  employed  in  related
positions with two other defense contractors since October 1993. He has previously had
favorable background investigations in September 1998 and April 2006. This appears to
be a periodic reinvestigation of that clearance (Item 1).
Applicant disclosed his IRS tax debt for tax years 2006-2007 and 2009-2013 on
his  January  2016  clearance  application  (Item  3),  and discussed  them  at  length  during
his  June  2017  interview  with  a  Government  investigator  (Item  4).  He  stated  that  he
received  a  notice(s)  in  January  2016  about  the  delinquent  tax  years,  made  one
telephone  call  to  the  IRS  that  went  unanswered,  and  thereafter  made  no  effort  to
contact  the  IRS  to  arrange  a  payment  schedule.  He  attributed  his  tax  debt  to  his  not
adjusting  his  income  tax  withholding  to  reflect  his  income.  However,  he  offered  no
explanation  for  his  failure  to  file  his  Federal  tax  returns  on  time.  Applicant’s  IRS  tax
transcripts for the years in question show that the IRS filed tax liens against Applicant in
July  2017.  Applicant’s  Answer  admits
tax  debt  and  states  only,  without
corroboration, that he was working with the IRS and his bank to pay the debt off.
the
Applicant denied failing to timely file his 2005-2007, 2010-2013, and 2016-2017
state  and  Federal  income  tax  returns  (SOR  1.a-1.r).  He  admits  owing  the  Internal
Revenue  Service  (IRS)  over  $58,000  (SOR  1.s-1.aa,  exclusive  of  1.w—not  used).
Applicant  denied  failing  to  timely  file  his  state  and  federal  income  tax  returns  for  nine
years.  However,  Applicant’s  IRS  tax  transcripts  for  2005-2016  (Item  4)  show  that
Applicant failed to timely file his Federal income tax returns for 2005-2006, 2010-2013,
and  2016.   Record  evidence  does  not  confirm  that  Applicant  failed  to  file  his  2017
Federal  income  tax  return  (SOR  1.i)  or  his  2005-2007,  2010-2013,  2016-2017  state
income tax returns (SOR 1.j-1.r). Accordingly, I find those allegations for Applicant.
Applicant  documented  no  credit  or  financial  counseling,  and  did  not  submit  a
budget.  He  provided  no  work  or  character  references,  or  evidence  of  community
involvement.
