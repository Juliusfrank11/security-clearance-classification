Applicant  admitted  the  seven  allegations  in  the  SOR.  His  admissions  are
incorporated into these findings.
Applicant is 38 years old and divorced since 2009. His seven-year-old son from
that marriage lives in another state with his mother. Applicant pays child support for his
son. Applicant earned an associate’s degree and is working on a bachelor’s degree. (Tr.
17-19)
After  graduating  from  high  school,  Applicant  enlisted  in  the  Army  in  1999.  He
served on active duty for six years. He received an honorable discharge, as a sergeant,
E-5. While serving, he deployed to the Middle East for a year and served in a combat unit.
(Tr. 19-22; GE 1) He has worked for defense contractors since 2005. In 2016, he started
a position working as an independent contractor for another Federal agency. (Tr. 22, 32;
GE 1) He was also a partner in a small company from 2010 until 2015. (Tr. 26, 31)
Applicant has a history of failing to timely file Federal income and state tax returns
and pay Federal taxes. (Tr. 28) He said the tax problems began with his 2010 Federal tax
return. He thought the company for whom he worked handled his taxes and filings. He
learned in 2011 or 2012 that his 2010 taxes remained unfiled and he owed about $59,000
in unpaid income taxes. He then hired an outside company to file his tax returns for that
year. That company failed to perform and he subsequently hired a second company to
resolve the 2010 tax issues. (Tr. 34-37)
Applicant acknowledged that his tax problems have been ongoing since tax year
2010. (Tr. 28) He testified that he had not filed his Federal tax returns for 2010, 2011,
2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. He said he did not know what to do after he learned that the
2010  return  was  not  filed.  He  admitted  that  he  should  have  been  more  proactive  in
addressing the tax issues. (Tr. 46-49, 73)
Contrary  to  Applicant’s  testimony,  transcripts  from  the  IRS,  dated  May  2018,
indicate that those six years’ returns were filed, albeit not all of them were filed timely.

According  to  the  May  2018  IRS  transcripts,  Applicant owed  $406,030  in  unpaid
taxes for the above years. (GE 2) His post-hearing submission indicated that on August
25, 2018, he paid the IRS $8,456 to resolve his 2015 tax debt. (AE A)
In response to a question about the discrepancy between his testimony that he had
not filed tax returns for years 2010 through 2015, and the IRS’s records indicating that he
had filed them, Applicant said he “might have [filed]” but could not remember. (Tr. 53, 79-
80) In a post-hearing submission, he stated the second company he hired to handle his
tax returns filed the above-mentioned returns. (AE A)
Applicant testified that he owed about $40,000 for his 2017 Federal taxes.3 To date
he has paid about $16,000 toward the 2017 tax debt (Tr. 48, 53, 62) He acknowledged
that he did not make estimated quarterly tax payments in 2017 or for other years when
he was an independent contractor. (Tr. 63, 73)
Applicant has filed his state income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2017.
(Tr. 54) As of December 14, 2018, he resolved a $57,791 tax debt he owed the state for
delinquent tax debts through a two-year payment plan. (Tr. 55-56; GE 3; AE B)
1 Applicant was a W-2 employee during 2015 and his taxes were deducted from his salary and paid by his
employer.
2 Applicant was a W-2 employee during 2016 and his taxes were deducted from his salary and paid by his
employer.
3 The SOR does not allege a security concern related to Applicant’s unpaid 2017 Federal tax debt. Hence,
it  will  not  be  discussed  in  analyzing  disqualifying  conditions.  It  may  be  considered  in  the  analysis  of
mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept, and in an evaluation of Applicant’s credibility.
In  2013  or  2014,  Applicant  contacted  the  IRS  to  establish  a  payment  plan  for
unpaid  taxes  for  previous  years,  but  he  never  entered  into  one.  (Tr.  43)  In  December
2018, he paid his 2015 Federal tax debt, but has not established a payment plan for tax
years  2010,  2011,  2012,  2013,  and  2014.  His  large  unpaid  Federal  income  tax  debt
remains unresolved. He admitted that he has been neglectful. (Tr. 75)
Applicant  earns  $140,000  annually  from  his  current  employer.  He  is  an
independent contractor and is responsible for tax planning for the year. He said he puts
about 30% of his monthly income aside for taxes. (Tr. 56-57)
