In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted without comments all of the factual
allegations  in  the  SOR  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  through  1.s.).  Applicant’s  admissions  are
incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the
evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due  consideration  of  same,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  a  technician  with  his  current  employer  (or  subcontractor)  since  November  2016.  A
2005  high  school  graduate,  Applicant  received  an  associate’s  degree  in  2012,  and  a
bachelor’s degree in 2014. He has never served with the U.S. military. He has never been
granted a security clearance. Applicant was married in 2012. He has no children.
Financial Considerations1
During his enhanced subject interview conducted by an investigator from the U.S.
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  in  September  2017,  Applicant  initially  denied
having any judgments filed against him or having any accounts sent to collections. Upon
being confronted with certain contrary facts, he either acknowledged the status of certain
accounts, disputed the status of some accounts, overlooked some accounts, or claimed
he  did  recall  anything  about  other  accounts.  He  subsequently  attributed  his  financial
issues to “bouts of unemployment and low paying jobs, where [he] was unable to cover
1 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in
the  following  exhibits:  Item  4  (e-QIP,  dated  June  15,  2017);  Item  5  (Enhanced  Subject  Interview,  dated
September 19, 2017); Item 6 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated June 22,
2017); Item 7 (Equifax Credit Report, dated January 31, 2018).
all of his debt.”2 But, he noted that in April 2017, he received a wage increase and that
increase would enable him to start paying off his delinquent debts.3 In his Answer to the
SOR, Applicant added that the debt was accrued because he was forced to use credit
cards and sustained his debt. “Unfortunately this debt became too much and [he] was
unable  to  pay  any  of  it  off.”4  In  his  e-QIP,  Applicant  noted  only  one  period  of
unemployment  (November  2011  until  September  2012)  after  he  was  let  go  by  mutual
agreement  (actually  fired)  following  notice  of  unsatisfactory  performance.  During  that
period,  he  was  a  student  supported  by  his  wife  and  unemployment  compensation.
Although he was not unemployed for any reported period thereafter, another employer
released him for unsatisfactory performance because Applicant routinely failed to follow
the company’s shift schedule and was repeatedly disciplined and counseled.5
The  SOR  identified  19  delinquent  accounts  that  had  been  placed  for  collection,
charged  off,  or  filed  as  judgments,  all  generally  reflected  by  Applicant’s  June  2017  or
January  2018  credit  reports.  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  had  made  no  effort  to
resolve the accounts, but stated that he planned to do so once the accounts with lower
balances are paid  off.6  Those  debts,  totaling approximately  $93,582,  all of  which  were
placed for collection, are described below:
(SOR ¶ 1.a.) an unspecified type of account for $1,355 that was sold to a debt
purchaser before becoming a judgment; (SOR ¶ 1.b.) an unspecified type of account for
$6,555 that was sold to a debt purchaser before being reduced to a judgment; (SOR ¶
1.c.) an unsecured guaranteed loan for $3,067 that was charged off; (SOR ¶¶ 1.d. through
1.p.) education loans that fell into default and were returned to the U.S. Department of
Education  in  the  amounts  of  $5,116;  $4,032;  $6,121;  $3,965;  $6,121;  $376;  $4,497;
$3,164; $6,619; $4,266; $6,913; $8,924; and $9,278; (SOR ¶ 1.q.) an unspecified type of
account for $11,621 that was charged off; (SOR ¶ 1.r.) an unspecified type of account for
$1,521 that went to judgment; and (SOR ¶ 1.s.) an unspecified type of account for $71.
Applicant failed to indicate his current monthly net pay, monthly expenses, debt
payments, or if he has any monthly remainder that might be available  for discretionary
spending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of financial
counseling. There is no evidence that since his April 2017 pay increase he has made any

off delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner
and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19,
2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).
efforts to contact his creditors, enter into repayment plans with any creditors, or make any
payments to any creditors to resolve any of his delinquent or charged-off accounts, even
to the one creditor to which he owes $71. While not alleged in the SOR, it is noted that
Applicant also had an account with a jewelry company with a high credit of $4,500 that
went to judgment, but was eventually paid off in 2016.7 Other than his general statements
about  his  future  intentions,  Applicant  offered  no  evidence  to  indicate  that  his  financial
situation has improved, or that it is now under control.
