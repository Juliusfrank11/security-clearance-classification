Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for
her  current  employer  since  2017.  She  attended  college  for  a  period,  but  she  has  not
earned a degree. She is the single mother of two minor children.2
Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  problems,  which  are  attributed  primarily  to
unemployment, underemployment, her children’s significant medical problems, and the
costs associated with being a single mother of two children without meaningful support
from the children’s father. She filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in 2005, and her debts
were discharged in 2006.3
The  SOR  alleges  41  delinquent  debts,  including  28  medical  debts  and  13
miscellaneous  debts.  However,  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.v;  1.c  and  1.p;
and 1.d, 1.t, and 1.u are duplicate accounts. There are 27 non-duplicate medical debts
and  10  non-duplicate  miscellaneous  debts.  The  debts  are  listed  on  a  February  2016
credit report, an October 2017 credit report, or both credit reports.4
The ten non-duplicate miscellaneous debts total about $4,350 and include debts
to  telecommunications  companies  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-$1,058;  1.d-$435;  and  1.bb-$371);
banks  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b-$694;  and  1.f-$366);  a  public  utility  (SOR  ¶  1.i-$938);  a  returned
check (SOR ¶ 1.hh-$60); a toll bridge (SOR ¶ 1.oo-$54); and two retail accounts (SOR
¶¶ 1.cc-$165; and 1.gg-$212).
Applicant  contracted  with  a  debt-settlement  company  in  January  2018.  She
enrolled  four  debts  totaling  $6,675  in  the  company’s  debt-settlement  program  (DSP),
including  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.  The  three  additional  debts  are  owed  to  two
financial institutions ($2,075 and $1,200) and a hospital ($2,500). It is difficult to ascribe
the three debts to any of the debts alleged in the SOR, although the hospital debt could

be connected to one or more SOR debts. The DSP documentation called for Applicant
to pay $252 per month for 18 months, plus $59 per month in fees.5
Applicant admitted owing the non-duplicate miscellaneous debts alleged in SOR
¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  1.f,  and  1.bb.  She  wrote  in  her  response  to  the  SOR  for  all  four  debts:  “I
have  made  payment  arrangements  with  a  debt  consolidation  company.”  She  wrote  In
her response to the FORM:
I finally landed a full time position last year. Since working full time I was
able  to  move  into  my  own  apartment.  I  have  been  trying  desperately  to
pay off my debts and maintain a household for me and my children. Many
of the debt[s] in question ha[ve] already been paid. Some of which are no
longer on my credit reports. I also contacted a debt consolidation company
to work out a payment plan. . . . I will continue to work on paying off all of
my debt as quickly as possible.
Applicant provided credit reports with her response to the SOR and FORM, but
no  actual  proof  of  payments.  I  reopened  the  record  for  her  to  submit  additional
documentation. She responded that she was no longer working with the debt-settlement
company  because  it  was  too  much  money.  On  January  29,  2019,  she  retained  a  law
firm  to  repair  her  credit  and  dispute  inaccurate  items  on  her  credit  report.  She  stated
that she is paying the law firm $109 per month. She also documented that on February
27, 2019, she paid the $435 debt to the telecommunications company (SOR ¶ 1.d).6
Applicant admitted owing the $938 public utilities debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i, but
she  wrote  that  she  was  “currently  making  payments  to  [the  utility  company]  on  this
account.”  The  debt  was  reported  by  Experian  on  the  February  2016  combined  credit
report, but it is not listed on the February 2018 Experian credit report.7
Applicant denied owing the non-duplicate miscellaneous debts alleged in SOR ¶¶
1.cc, 1.gg, 1.hh, and 1.oo. She stated that she was unaware of the $165 debt alleged in
SOR ¶ 1.cc. The debt was reported by Equifax on the February 2016 combined credit
report, but it is not listed on the October 2017 Equifax credit report, nor any other credit
report.8
Applicant  stated  that  she  paid  the  $212  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.gg.  The  debt
was  reported  with  a  $212  balance  on  the  February  2016  combined  credit  report.  The
February  2018  Experian  credit  report  and  the  March  2018  TransUnion  credit  report,
which were submitted by Applicant, also report the account with a $212 balance.9

Applicant  denied  owing  the  $60  debt  for  a  returned  check  (SOR  ¶  1.hh).  She
stated that her credit union was hacked during the time the check was being processed.
The debt was reported by Experian on the February 2016 combined credit report and on
the  three  credit  reports  from  February  and  March  2018.  On  July  18,  2018,  she  sent  a
letter  to  the  creditor  requesting  verification  of  the  account  and  deletion  from  her  credit
report if not verified. No additional information on its status was provided.10
Applicant  stated  that  she  paid  the  $54  debt  for  a  toll  bridge  (SOR  ¶  1.oo).  The
debt was reported by TransUnion on the February 2016 combined credit report. It is not
reported on any subsequent report.11
Applicant  admitted  owing  some  of  the  medical  debts,  while  denying  owing  the
rest. Some of the debts have been removed from her credit report, but there is no other
evidence that any of the medical debts have been paid.12
Credit reports indicate that Applicant paid or settled a $188 debt and a $402 debt
that  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  The  February  2016  credit  report  lists  a  $19,671
deferred  student  loan.  The  balance  had  increased  to  $26,966  on  the  October  2017
credit  report.  The  loan  is  reported  in  March  2018  as  deferred  with  a  $27,366  balance.
The deferment was scheduled to end in May 2018.13
