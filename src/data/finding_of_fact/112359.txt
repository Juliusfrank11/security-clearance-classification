Applicant  is  a  33-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance.  He  is  employed  as  a  transportation  operations  specialist.  He  has  been  so
employed  since  March  2016.  His  formal  education  includes  a  bachelor’s  degree  in
business administration awarded in 2008. He has never married and has no children.
Applicant’s  employment  history  includes  three  periods  of  unemployment  since
2011.  He  was  laid  off  from  a  job  in  February  2011  and  unemployed  until  about  June
2011. He then had a part-time job as an office assistant from June 2011 to November
2011,  when  he  departed  because  it  was  a  temporary  job.  He  was  unemployed  from
November  2011  to  February  2012.  He  then  had  another  part-time  job  as  a  museum
guide from February 2012 to November 2015, when he was terminated or fired. He was
unemployed  from  November  2015  to  March  2016,  when  he  began  his  current  job.  He
received  unemployment  compensation  during  all  three  periods  of  unemployment.  He
estimated that it amounted to 60% less than the income he earned.
The SOR, as amended, concerns a history of financial problems consisting of the
following:  (1)  six  delinquent  student  loan  accounts  placed  for  collection  or  charged  off
for a total of approximately $62,000; (2) five consumer accounts placed for collection or
charged  off  for  a  total  of  approximately  $5,172;  (3)  back  taxes  owed  to  a  state  tax
authority for tax years 2011 and 2012 in the amount of approximately $2,704, as well as
failure  to  timely  file  state  income  tax  returns  for tax  years  2011  through  2015;  and  (4)
failure to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2015, as well
as  failure  to  timely  pay  federal  income  tax  when  due  for  those  tax  years.  Applicant
admitted  to  all  the  SOR  allegations  in  his  answer  to  the  SOR  or  during  his  hearing
testimony.  Additional  evidence  establishing  the  SOR  allegations  is  found  in  the
documentary evidence.
Overall,  Applicant  attributed  his  history  of  financial  problems  to  the  unexpected
circumstances  that occurred  in  2011,  the  three  periods of  unemployment,  and the  two
part-time jobs he had before returning to full-time employment in 2016. The unexpected
circumstances  in  2011  consisted  of  an  incident  where  he  was  stabbed  in  the  back
(resulting  in  only  minor  injuries)  while  in  a  bar,  and  injuries  sustained  in  two  car
accidents resulting in a strained neck and a bruised spine. (Tr. 39-41).
The six delinquent student loans are now held by two different entities. Applicant
obtained the loans while earning his bachelor’s degree from August 2003 to May 2008.
Three accounts, with a total balance due of $56,919 as of July 2018, are held by a debt-
collection  company  contracted  by  the  current  creditor.  (Exhibit  B)  The  debt-collection
company  offered  Applicant  the  opportunity  to  enter  into  a  repayment  plan  with  a
reduced interest rate in August 2017 as well as a lump-sum settlement offer of $5,490 in
July 2018, but he was unable to accept either offer. He attempted to obtain a loan so he
could accept the lump-sum offer, but he was unable to do so. (Tr. 69-71)
The  other  three  student  loans,  which  were  obtained  from  the  Department  of
Education, are now in a repayment arrangement. (Exhibits C and D). Initially, Applicant
was required to make a series of payments to rehabilitate the loans, completed in June
2018, which qualified his accounts for transfer to one of the Department of Education’s
loan servicers. A loan transfer of $7,727, with a principal balance of $6,964, was  made
in June 2018. Applicant made payments in July, August, September, and October 2018.
Concerning the five delinquent consumer accounts, one is repaid, three are in a
repayment  arrangement,  and  one  is  unresolved.  Applicant  paid  the  $1,387  collection
account, stemming from a mobile-phone account, in full in September 2018. (Exhibit F)
He is using the services of a consumer-credit-counseling firm to repay three accounts.
(Exhibit  E)  The  arrangement  began  in  April  2018,  and  he  made  monthly  payments  of
$108  in  April,  May,  June,  July,  August,  and  October  2018.  Applicant  denied  the  $346
collection  account  in  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  but  he  acknowledged  in  his  hearing
testimony that the debt was his and stemmed from automobile insurance. (Tr. 57-60) He
further explained that he contacted the debt-collection company, they had no record of
the account and advised him to dispute the account, which he said he is doing.
Applicant  fell  behind  on  his  state  and  federal  income  tax  obligations  during  his
period  of  unemployment  and  underemployment  during  2011  through  2015.  He  altered
his tax withholding to maximize his income during that period. He did not file tax returns
because he knew he would owe money he could not then afford to pay. Applicant filed
all  the  past-due  state  and  federal  income  tax  returns  in  January  2017,  along  with  his
returns for tax year 2016. He also entered into repayment arrangements with both the
state tax authority and the IRS.
Concerning  the  state,  he  reached  a  payment  agreement  in  April  2018  on  a
balance of $2,773 for tax years 2011, 2012, and 2016. (Exhibits G and H) He agreed to
make  $200  monthly  payments  and  has  done  so  through  October  2018.  He  estimated
owing about $1,000. (Tr. 36)
Concerning the IRS, he entered into an installment agreement in August 2017 for
tax  years  2011,  2012,  2014,  2015,  and  2016.  (Exhibit  I).  He  agreed  to  make  $200
monthly  payments  beginning  on  September  15,  2017.  He  made  seven  monthly
payments,  for  a  total  of  $1,400,  from  October  2017  to  June  2018.  (Exhibit  J).  Those
payments reduced the balance to $2,788 from $4,379 as of July 2018. The most recent
account  statement  from  November  2018  shows  he  owes  $2,982  for  balances  due  for
tax years 2012 and 2017. (Exhibit K)
Applicant  stated  that  he  earned  an  annual  salary  of  about  $59,000.  He  further
stated that he had no money in the bank or other financial institution, although he was
participating in his employer’s 401(k) retirement plan. He does not use a credit card and
manages his finances with a debit card connected to his checking account.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
1  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S.  518,  528  (1988)  (“it  should  be  obvious  that  no  one  has  a
‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no
right to a security clearance).
2 484 U.S. at 531.
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.6
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;
3 484 U.S. at 531.
4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).
5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).
6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶¶ E3.1.14 and E3.1.15.
AG ¶ 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local
income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income
tax as required;
AG  ¶  20(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  a  death,  divorce,  or
separation,  clear  victimization  by  predatory  lending  practices,  or  identity
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and
AG ¶ 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax
authority  to  file  or  pay  the  amount  owed  and  is  in  compliance  with  those
arrangements.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.  The
disqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.
Applicant  is  in  a  difficult  situation  where  he  is  dealing  with  a  large  amount  of
indebtedness with a number of creditors or collectors.  His problematic financial history
is  traceable  to  unexpected  circumstances  in  2011  when  he  was  injured  in  two  car
accidents, and he then began a years-long period of periodic unemployment and part-
time  employment,  which  only  ended  in  March  2016  when  he  began  his  current  job.
Since then, he’s done a decent job addressing a number of the delinquent debts. Three
of  the  student  loans  were  rehabilitated  and  are  now  in  a  repayment  arrangement.  He
paid  off  one  of  the  consumer  debts  and  placed  three  accounts  in  a  repayment
arrangement.  He  also  filed  all  the  past-due  state  and  federal  income  tax  returns  in
January  2017  (before  the  SOR  was  issued),  and  he  reduced  the  balances  owed  for
back taxes via repayment arrangements with the state and federal tax authorities.
Unfortunately, the largest delinquent debts, the three student loans for more than
$50,000,  remain  wholly  unresolved.  That  is  a  sizeable  amount  of  money.  Moreover,  I
consider nonpayment of student loans a serious matter, akin to nonpayment of income
tax or court-ordered child support. Applicant has neither a realistic plan nor the means
to  address  the  loans.  I  have  credited  Applicant  for  circumstances  largely  beyond  his
control,  and  note  than  he  has  made  progress  in  repaying  debt  and  fixing  his  tax
problems.  Nevertheless,  the  evidence  is  not  sufficient  to  fully  mitigate  the  security
concern stemming from his long-standing history of financial problems, which is ongoing
and likely to continue for the foreseeable future.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent  standard,  I  have  doubts  about
Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or
sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence  as  a  whole
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or  vice
versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he has  not met his
ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  show  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a -- 1.n:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for
access to classified information.
