Applicant is a 32-year-old divorcée with no children. She was married from 2008
until  2015.  Having  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree,  completed  some  graduate  study,  and
mastered  three  languages,  she  is  presently  an  operations  specialist.  Successful  at
work,  she  was  recently  given  a  pay  raise,  increasing  her  annual  salary  to  $59,000.
Applicant has received credit counseling.
During  her  marriage,  both  Applicant  and  her  husband  worked.  She  does  not
recall his salary, but remembers their joint income supported their household, with her
salary paying for the lion’s share. (Tr. 19) Applicant found herself in an unhappy marital
situation. Her 2015 divorce left her with marital bills that were deemed her responsibility
and  which  she  could  not  pay.  (Tr.  18)  They  subsequently  became  delinquent  despite
her  efforts.  Her  salary  as  a  single  teacher  earning  a  gross  income  of  about  $32,000
could not cover both the delinquent bills and her current expenses, including rent, food,
auto, and other day-to-day costs.
At issue in the SOR are the following delinquent debts:
1.a & 1.b – Student loan ($10,112) and Student loan ($5,993) – These two loans
were  combined  in  the  debt  rehabilitation  process.  (Tr.  31)  During  2018,  a  payment  of
$78  was  processed  toward  these  debts.  Processing  for  future  payments  on  the  plan
was  delayed  because  the  lender  needed  tax  return  information  from  Applicant.  Ex. W
reflects a payment of $271 on the debts in January 2019. Ex. A is a statement showing
a payment will be processed in the future. Ex. B is a schedule of payments to be made
in the future. A second payment (pending) is reflected from February 2019 at Ex. Y.
1.c – Past due account with balance of $427 – Paid. (Ex. C; Tr. 23, 31-32)
1.d – Charged off account ($666) – Account satisfied and current. (Exs. D-E; Tr.
23)
1.e Debts ($1,051 medical balance from August 2012); 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j ($1,051,
$118, $118,  $118, $86  (medical  balances  dating from 2014-2015.  (Exs.  F-J,  Z-AA; Tr.
23-25).
1.i – Student debt ($3,013 in collection since August 2014) – Applicant believes
this  was  incorporated  into  the  student  debts  since  consolidated  from  1.a  and  1.b,  but
failed to provide documentary evidence to that effect. (Tr. 34)
Applicant  is  currently  able  to  pay  her  day-to-day  living  expenses  and  make
needed  payments  to  her  remaining  delinquent  debts.  (Tr.  25)  She  now  has  a  savings
account. Combined, her checking and savings accounts have a current balance of over
$5,500. (Tr. 26)
