Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  in  SOR,  except  for  SOR  allegation  ¶  1.a.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  35-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  pages  5
and 16.) He has been employed as a linguist with the defense contractor since January
of  2017.  (GX  1  at  page  16.)  In  August  of  2017,  while  on  patrol  with  U.S.  Marines,
Applicant was wounded by a suicide bomber. (TR at page 38 line 14 to page 40 line 25,
at page 82 lines 6~25, and AppX C1.) He has submitted eight letters of support (AppXs
A,  E  and  J),  to  include  one  from  a  Brigadier  General  (AppX  E5),  and  numerous
Certificates of Appreciation (AppX H1~9).
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a. Applicant denied that his mother is a citizen and resident of Afghanistan, as
she  is  now  deceased.  (TR  at  page  43  lines  16~18,  and  at  page  44  lines  2~6.)  This
occurred in January of 2018, and Applicant could not attend her funeral as he could not
leave the protection of his military post. (Id.)
1.b.  Applicant  admits  that  three  brothers  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Afghanistan. (TR at page 50 line 10 to page 52 line 3, and at page 53 line 14 to page 55
line 6.) Two of these brothers are merchants, and the third a teacher. (Id.) To the best of
his  knowledge  and  belief  none  of  these  brothers  are  connected  to  the  Afghan
government.
1.c.  Applicant  admits  that  a  fourth  brother,  also  a  citizen  and  resident  of
Afghanistan, was a “Clerk” for the Afghan government. (TR at page 52 line 4 to page 53
line 12.) He is currently unemployed, but most recently worked for a U.S. company. (TR
at page 55 lines 7~21, and at page 69 lines 7~23.)
1.d. Applicant admits that between 2010~2016, he gave a total of about $5,000
to a brother, in support of his, now deceased, mother. Applicant disclosed this financial
to
the  U.S.  Government,
in  January  of  2011,  as  evidenced  by  his
support
Counterintelligence-Focused  Security  Screening  Questionnaire  (CFSSQ).  (TR  at  page
42 line 7 to page 43 line 18, at page 55 line 22 to page 56 line 11, and GX  at page 7.)
Guideline E - Personal Conduct
2.a. Applicant answered “No” on his February 2017 e-QIP to the question: “Have
you EVER provided financial support for any foreign national?” (GX 1 at page 51.) He
mistakenly thought this question did not apply to his immediate family. (TR at page 56
line  12  to  page  60  line  6,  and  at  page  71  line  1  to  page  74  line  24.)  Applicant  had
already  disclosed  his  mother’s  financial  support,  through  his  brother,  in  his  January
2011 CFSSQ. He reaffirmed his 2011 admission, just 12 days after he executed his e-
QIP, when he again executed a February 2017 CFSSQ. (GX 4 at pages 1 and 2.) I find
no willful falsification, here.
2.b.  Applicant  admits  that  he  resided  in  the  United  States  illegally  from  about
2006~2010. In about 2003, as an 18 year old,  he started working as an interpreter for
U.S. Forces in Afghanistan. (TR at page 22 lines 5~13, and at page 28 line 21 to page
31 line 12.) In 2006, while Applicant was training in the United States, he discovered he
was on a “hit list” if and when he returned to Afghanistan. (Id, and 60 line 7 to page 61
line 9, and at page 68 line 11 to page 69 line 2.)  As a result, he went to live with a half-
brother in California from 2006~2010. (Id.) Applicant disclosed his illegal status when he
applied for and was granted a Green Card. (TR at page 34 line 17 to page 36 line 11,
and at page 37 line 1 to page 38 line 13.) He was again deployed back to Afghanistan in
support  of  U.S.  forces,  and  while  there  applied  for  and  was  granted  U.S.  citizenship.
(Id.)
Notice
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  following  regarding  Afghanistan.  A  U.S.
Department of State Travel Advisory remains in effect for Afghanistan. Extremist groups
and kidnapping syndicates are actively targeting foreign nationals. Decades of disorder
and warfare have made Afghanistan fertile territory for international terroism.
