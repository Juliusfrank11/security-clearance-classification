Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for
her  current  employer  since  September  2016.  She  is  a  high  school  graduate.  She  is
married with an adult child, a minor child, and an adult stepchild.1
Applicant has a history of financial problems, which include tax returns that were
not filed on time, unpaid taxes, delinquent debts, and a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. She
attributes her financial problems primarily to her unemployment in 2008 and 2009, and
her  minor  child’s  significant  and  persistent  medical  problems.  Her  child  had  multiple
surgeries  and  procedures  and  requires  recurring  medical  care.  Even  with  insurance,
Applicant’s  and  her  husband’s  annual  out-of-pocket  expenses  for  their  child’s  medical
care has been greater than $10,000.2
Applicant  and  her  husband  filed  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  case  in  2012.  Under
Schedule D, Creditors Holding Secured Claims, the petition listed $300,651 in secured
claims,  which  included  a  mortgage  loan  and  two  vehicle  loans.  Under  Schedule  E,
Creditors Holding Unsecured Priority Claims, the petition listed $4,055 in federal income
taxes owed by Applicant’s husband to the IRS for the 2004, 2007, and 2010 tax years.
The  petition  listed  debts  totaling  $83,864  under  Schedule  F,  Creditors  Holding
Unsecured  Nonpriority  Claims.  Applicant  and  her  husband  realized  that  it  would  be
difficult to maintain payments with her husband’s sporadic income, and they converted
the  case  to  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy.  Their  dischargeable  debts  were  discharged  in
2012.3
Applicant  incurred  additional  financial  problems  after  the  bankruptcy  discharge.
The  SOR  alleges  15  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $6,976.  Six  of  the  debts  totaling
$1,724  are  medical  debts.  Applicant  admitted  owing  all  of  the  delinquent  debts  except
for  the  $253  credit  card  debt  alleged  in  SOR  1.k,  which  she  asserted  has  been  paid.
Applicant stated that she paid a number of the debts alleged in the SOR. She submitted
credit reports that show that some of the delinquent debts are no longer reported. She
stated  that  she  has  been  paying  the  smallest  debts  first,  and  then  moving  on  to  the
largest debts.4 Her assertions about the delinquent debts are accepted.
The SOR also alleges that Applicant did not file her state and federal income tax
returns  for  tax  years  2014  and  2016;  that  she  owes  the  IRS  $5,941  for  tax  year  2013
and $1,313 for 2015; and that she owes her state $1,795 for tax year 2013 and $1,913
for  2015.  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  tax  allegations.  She  stated  that  she  usually
prepared her and her husband’s tax returns, and she panicked when she was preparing
1 Tr. at 31, 56; GE 1; AE A.
2 Tr. at 21-23; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 5; AE A.
3 Tr. at 23-25; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 5.
4 Tr. at 17, 44-50, 56; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3-5; AE B, C.
their 2014 returns because they owed so much. She stated that “then life took over and
[she] forgot about the taxes.”5
Applicant  and  her  husband  retained  a  tax  professional  to  prepare  their  income
tax  returns.  Their  2016  state  and  federal  income  tax  returns  were  filed  in  November
2018. The returns indicated their adjusted gross income was $138,018, and they owed
the  IRS  $4,538  and  the  state  $1,059.  Those  amounts  do  not  include  interest  and
penalties. They did not pay the IRS and the state when the tax returns were filed. She
stated  that  the  tax  professional  is  working  on  the  2014  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns, but they have not yet been filed.6
IRS tax transcripts show that as of March 2018, Applicant and her husband owed
the  IRS  $5,941,  which  includes  interest  and  penalties,  for  tax  year  2013.  As  of
December  2018,  they  owed  the  IRS  $4,320  for  tax  year  2015.  They  were  due  a  $378
federal refund for tax year 2017, but that amount was withheld and applied to their tax
liability  for  tax  year  2010.  Applicant  testified  that  the  taxes  owed  to  the  state  for  2013
and  2015  were  paid  through  a  refund  from  tax  year  2017,  but  she  did  not  submit  any
supporting documentation.7
Applicant stated that once all the tax returns are filed, she and her husband will
enter  a  payment  plan  with  the  IRS  to  pay  their  back  taxes.  She  also  plans  to  pay  her
state taxes. Her current job pays well, and she has the financial ability to pay her taxes
and other debts. She received financial counseling as a requirement of her bankruptcy.8
