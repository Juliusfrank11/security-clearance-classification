Applicant is 38 years old. He graduated from high school in 1999 and obtained his
bachelor’s  degree  in  2003.  He  obtained  a  master’s  degree  in  2008.  He  has  been
employed  as  an  architect  for  a  federal  contractor  since  2004.  He  was  promoted  to
principal  and  partner  in  an  architectural  firm  engaged  as  a  federal  contractor  in  2018.
Applicant reports no military service, and he has never married. Applicant previously held
a security clearance since 2007, without incident.
On May 12, 2017, Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SCA),
and in section 23 (illegal use of drugs or drug activity) he responded “yes” to questions
about illegal drug use and/or misuse of prescription drugs within the last seven years. He
estimated his first use of marijuana was in January 2002, and he used marijuana (MJ)
“once or  twice  a  year, for fun,  with friends.”2 He  also  stated  that he  used  MJ  while  he
possessed a security clearance and he did not intend to use any controlled substances
in the future. In an earlier SCA signed by Applicant on December 21, 2006, he responded
“yes” to similar questions about any illegal use of drugs or controlled substance in section
24 (Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity).3 He indicated that he used MJ about 10-15
times between September 1999 and February 2002. He was granted a security clearance
in 2007.
In his Answer to the SOR in April 2018, Applicant stated that his most recent use
of MJ in 2017, was due to a misinterpretation of the change in the law effectively legalizing
MJ in Washington, D.C. He used the drug only recreationally at social settings where it
was provided by friends and he never cultivated, sold, or purchased MJ. Since the District
is a federalized city, he wrongly assumed that the legalization of MJ applied across the
federal  government.  Although,  he  self-reported  his  use  of  MJ  occurring  between
September 1999 and May 2017, Applicant stated that there was a long lapse of several
years before he re-offended in 2017. He does not know which years he used MJ, or the
exact  number  of  usages.  He  provided  a  statement  of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  drug
involvement or substance misuse subject to revocation of his national security eligibility.

Clearance Application (SCA) (Item 3) and his SCA dated December 21, 2006 (item 4).
2 Item 3, p. 35.
3 Item 4, p. 29.
Applicant has never been diagnosed as having a substance-abuse disorder and
he did not seek treatment. He has now disassociated from friends who use MJ. Applicant
also attached his resume, detailing his significant experience and accomplishments in his
profession, several letters of appreciation, and two performance appraisals showing that
he was rated excellent or outstanding in all categories. He has experience working on
high  visibility,  secure,  projects.  He  received  year-end  bonuses  each  year  from  2014 –
2017. He also provided four positive character reference letters at Tab E attached to his
Answer  to  the  SOR,  including  one  from  his  facility  security  officer  (FSO).  All  attest  to
Applicant’s integrity, trustworthiness, and reliability.
