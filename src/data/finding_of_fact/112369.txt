In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  with  comments  all  of  the  factual
allegations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.t.). Applicant’s admissions and comments
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the
evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due  consideration  of  same,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a material specialist with his current employer since February 2017. A 1993 high school
graduate,  Applicant  received  an  associate’s  degree  in  2014,  and  completed  additional
credits but no other degree. He has never served with the U.S. military. He has never
been  granted  a  security  clearance.  Applicant  was  married  the  first  time  in  2007,  and
divorced in 2015. He remarried in 2016. Although he did not list having any children in his
e-QIP, Applicant has two children born in 1994 and 1996.
Financial Considerations1
In his e-QIP, Applicant essentially attributed his financial difficulties to a period of
unemployment in 2014 that left him with insufficient funds to pay his rent. He also noted
that  his  ex-wife  was  to  repay  one  particular  credit  card  in  2013  because  he  was  not
working.  He  denied  having  any  other  delinquencies,  accounts  in  collection,  accounts
1 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in
the following exhibits: Item 4 (e-QIP, dated February 13, 2017); Item 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion,
and Equifax Credit Report, dated April 19, 2017); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated December 12, 2017);
Item 7 (Equifax Credit Report, dated April 30, 2018); Item 8 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated August 25,
2017); Item 3 (Answer to the SOR, dated March 19, 2018).
charged off, or repossessions,2 a position that was untrue.3 During his enhanced subject
interview conducted by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management
(OPM)  in  August  2017,  Applicant  initially  denied  having  any  other  accounts  sent  to
collections. Upon being confronted with certain contrary facts, he generally acknowledged
the delinquent status of most of the accounts. He noted that he had experienced several
periods of unemployment: October 2012 until February 2013, because he quit his job to
relocate to his spouse’s new job location, and he was supported by his spouse and his
401(k); May 2013 until July 2013, for the same reasons; November 2013 until December
2013, while he was attending school, studying, and looking for a new job, and supported
by his spouse; July 2014 until October 2014, after he was fired, and was supported by his
spouse; and November 2016 until February 2017, after he quit and got remarried.
During  that  OPM  interview,  Applicant  stated  that  it  was  his  plan  to  rectify  his
financial problems over the next five years with increased salaries until the accounts were
paid off.4 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant added that the debt was accrued because
he had “endured some hardship” and his new plan was to have all of his creditors “paid
off within [two] years, but no longer than [five] years.”5 In an undated Answer to the FORM,
Applicant modified his plan by stating that he will have all of his small creditors paid off in
two years, and the remaining creditors will be paid off in five years.6
The  SOR  identified  20  delinquent  accounts  that  had  been  placed  for  collection,
charged off, or repossessed, all generally reflected by Applicant’s April 2017, December
2017, or April 2018 credit reports. Applicant acknowledged that he had made no effort to
resolve  nearly  all  the accounts,  largely  because of a  lack  of  income,  but  reiterated his
intention to rectify them. Those debts, totaling approximately $21,206, all of which were
placed for collection, are described below:

3 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal
Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to
evaluate  an  applicant's  evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to  consider
whether  an  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful  rehabilitation;  (d)  to  decide  whether  a  particular
provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis
under Directive § 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No.
02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also
ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd.
Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant’s unlisted and unalleged
delinquent accounts, as well as his lack of candor on his e-QIP, will be considered only for the five purposes
listed above.
4 Item 8, supra note 1. It should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay
off delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner
and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19,
2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).
5 Item 5, supra note 1.
6 AE B (Answer to the FORM, undated).
(SOR ¶ 1.a.) is a joint (with his ex-wife) credit-card account for $6,061 that was
charged off, and by virtue of their divorce decree, both Applicant and his ex-wife are each
responsible for one-half of the balance; (SOR ¶ 1.b.) is an automobile loan with an unpaid
balance of $4,404 that was voluntarily repossessed; (SOR ¶ 1.c.) is an apartment lease
with an unpaid balance of $3,402 from which Applicant was evicted; (SOR ¶¶ 1.d., 1.h.,
1.k., 1.l., 1.n., 1.o., and 1.q.) are medical accounts with unpaid balances of $1,966; $465;
$368; $231; $207; $206; and $195; (SOR ¶¶ 1.e. through 1.g.) are credit-card accounts
with unpaid balances of $623; $604; and $491, that were charged off; (SOR ¶ 1.i.) is a
cellular  telephone  account  with  an  unpaid  balance  of  $424  that  was  charged  off;  and
(SOR ¶ 1.j.) is an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance of $372. None of
those accounts have been resolved.
In addition, there are several accounts for which there is some evidence of possible
resolution efforts made by Applicant:
(SOR ¶ 1.m.) is a cable internet or television account with an unpaid balance of
$216 for which Applicant submitted one document acknowledging an authorization to the
collection agent to debit $108.08 on June 20, 2018  – three months after the SOR was
issued.7  There  is  also  a  handwritten  entry  by  an  unidentified  individual  indicating  that
another debit might be scheduled for June 27, 2018, but there is no documentation (bank
account  or  credit  card  register  or  statement,  or  creditor-issued  receipt)  to  indicate  that
one payment, much less two payments, had actually been made. The account has not
been  resolved.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.p.,  1.r.,  1.s.,  and  1.t.)  are  medical  accounts  with  the  same
collection agent with unpaid balances of $353; $222; $199; and $197, totaling $971. In
his Answer to the FORM, Applicant contended that he had paid off each of those accounts
“as of May 30, 2018,”8 and he attached a letter from the collection agent acknowledging
his authorization for them to initiate weekly $100 electronic payments from his account
commencing on March 21, 2018, and continuing until May 30, 2018,9 totaling $1,100. The
authorization does not identify the creditor account numbers to be addressed. Applicant
failed to submit any documentation, including account registers, creditor receipts, etc., to
support  his  contentions  that  the  payments  had  been  made.  In  the  absence  of  some
documentation to support his reported efforts, the accounts have not been resolved.
In  response  to  comments  made  by  Department  Counsel  regarding  evidence  of
possible  irresponsible  spending  by  Applicant  when  he  purchased  a  new  automobile
(actually a used 2009 luxury vehicle) in February 2018, for $12,941, Applicant stated that
most  of  the  funds  came  from  his  insurance  after  his  earlier  vehicle  was  totally  lost
following an accident in March 2016.10
7 AE C (Letter, dated June 14, 2018).
8 AE B, supra note 6, at 1.
9 Item 3 (Letter, dated March 21, 2018), attached to Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1.
10 AE B, supra note 6, at 1; AE A (Statement, dated February 12, 2018); Also see AE A (Customer
Payment History Recap Sheet, dated February 14, 2018).
In addition to the SOR-related accounts, there is an educational loan for $7,268
with an unpaid balance of $5,941 that was placed for collection in February 2018.11 For
some  reason,  not  explained  by  Applicant,  he  submitted  two  scheduled  payments  of
$131.18 each to a collection agent for an unidentified creditor or account to take place in
July  2018.12  In  the  absence  of  some  commentary  connecting  the  payments  to  some
account, the significance of the document is minimal.
Applicant failed to indicate his current monthly net pay, monthly expenses, debt
payments, or if he has any monthly remainder that might be available  for discretionary
spending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of financial
counseling.  There  is  little  evidence  that  since  his  SOR  was  issued  in  March  2018,
Applicant  has  made any  significant  efforts to  contact  the  vast majority  of  his creditors,
enter into repayment plans with creditors, or make payments to creditors to resolve most
of his delinquent or charged-off accounts, even to the smaller creditors to which he owes
$195,  $206,  or  $207.  Other  than  his  general  statements  about  his  future  intentions,
Applicant offered no evidence to indicate that his financial situation has improved, or that
it is now under control.
