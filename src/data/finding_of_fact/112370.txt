Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a through  1.d, 1.h,  and  1.i with  explanations.  She
denied SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and
exhibits, I make the following findings of fact, in chronological order.
Applicant is 41 years old. She earned a bachelor’s degree in 2016. She is married
and has three minor children. (Answer.) She has been employed in her position with a
government contractor since June 2015, although the contract holder changed in March
2017.  She was unemployed from August 2012 to May 2015. (Item 5.)
Applicant  filed  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  September  2009  (SOR  ¶  1.b).  She
attributed her financial problems at that time to an unstated period of separation from her
husband.  In  2009  her  husband  was  discharged  from  the  Army  and  diagnosed  with
multiple sclerosis. They separated and Applicant was left to support her daughter. She
could not afford to pay all of her bills on her salary. As a result, she consulted an attorney,
who  recommended  she file  Chapter  7 bankruptcy.  She  discharged $155,518  in  claims
through that bankruptcy in February 2010. She has since reconciled with her husband.
(Answer; Item 6.)
Applicant owed Federal income taxes for tax years 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2014,
in the amounts of $732; $7,279; $4,560; and $3,843, respectively, as alleged in SOR ¶¶
1.d through 1.g. Those amounts are reflected on March 2018 account transcripts from the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS). As of April 2018, Applicant owed $0 for 2010, 2012, and
2013 after balances of $546 for 2010; $5,937 for 2012; and $4,047 for 2013 were “written
off” by the IRS.  She has established multiple installment agreements with the IRS in the
past, but has no history of regular payments under those agreements. (Answer; Reply;
Item 3; Item 5.)
Additionally,  Applicant  failed  to file  her  Federal  and  state tax  returns  in  a  timely
manner  in  2011,  as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c.  They  were  filed  late,  in  October  2012.  She
blamed the late filing on having a baby in March 2012 and moving to another state in July
2012. Her 2011 IRS account transcript reflected she had a zero account balance for 2011.
(Answer; Reply; Item 3; Item 5.)
Applicant  was  employed  by  a  U.S.  government  agency  from  July  2011  to  July
2012. In March 2012, she was confronted by her supervisor and accused of using her
government credit card for personal use (SOR ¶ 1.i). Applicant admitted she used her
government  credit  card  to  take  out  three  “cash  advance[s]  for  gas  money  and  to  help
supplement for food and bills.” She set up a repayment plan with her employer, but failed
to complete the repayment plan when she terminated her employment in August 2012.
The debt was eventually discharged in her 2017 Chapter 7 bankruptcy, discussed below.
She received an IRS 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt, from this creditor.  (Answer; Item 5.)
Applicant was indebted to her state taxation authority for delinquent taxes in the
amount of $2,218 (SOR ¶ 1.h). In February 2018, she set up a payment agreement to
resolve  this  debt  through  23  monthly  payments  of  $145.  She  failed  to  produce
documentation of payments under that agreement. This debt is unresolved. (Answer; Item
5.)
In October 2017 Applicant filed her second petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy (SOR
¶ 1.a). She discharged $115,187 in debt on January 10, 2018. (Item 4; Item 7; Item 8.)
Applicant  received  financial  counseling  from  a  financial  readiness  center.
Documentation  from  financial  counseling  suggests  Applicant  and  her  husband  have  a
monthly surplus of $1,094, after their monthly expenses are paid. The financial counselor
advised them to pay off small debts first and begin to pay back student loans, which are
currently in deferred status. The financial counselor recommended Applicant’s husband
quit smoking. They were advised to eliminate unnecessary services and subscriptions to
save  money.  It  is  unclear  from  the  record  if  Applicant  implemented  any  of  these
suggestions, although she indicated she was working to improve her finances and resolve
her debts. (Answer; Response.)
