Applicant is a 63-year-old woman, twice divorced, with two adult children. She has a
high school diploma, and she served in the U.S. Air Force National Guard from 1977 to
1979.  She  was  discharged  honorably.  Since  2014,  she  has  worked  for  a  defense
contractor as a senior subcontracts administrator. (Item 3)
The SOR alleges a delinquent credit card in the amount of $25,098 (subparagraph
1.a), and a deficiency stemming from a car repossession, totaling $9,418 (subparagraph
1.b).  Applicant  admits  that  she  incurred  the  debts  in  2010,  but  denies  being  currently
responsible for them, as they have been charged off her credit report. (Item 4 at 3) She
was aware of the debts when she completed interrogatories in March 2018, but had no
intention of paying them, as the seven-year statute of limitation was set to elapse within a
year of answering the interrogatories. (Item 4 at 3)
The  Government  propounded  interrogatories  to  Applicant  in  2018. Interrogatory
number two asked her to list any delinquencies and to provide documents as to what she
was doing to resolve them, noting as follows:
Simply a written statement that you are making payments on a debt or that a
debt  was  paid,  disputed,  repossessed,  charged  off  or otherwise not your
responsibility, is not sufficient documentation. You must also provide valid
PROOF of whatever claims you are making concerning each account.
Applicant contends that she is financially stable, as she recently was approved for a
home  loan  at  a  favorable  interest  rate,  and  that  no  problems  arose  when  the
mortgage company checked her credit.
