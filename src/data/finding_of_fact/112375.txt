In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comments, all of the factual
allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.q.).
Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and
thorough  review  of  the  evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon due  consideration of  same, I
make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  test  technician  with  his  current  employer  since  March  2013.  A  1977  high  school
graduate,  Applicant  received  a  non-credited  certificate  in  electronics  in  1986.  He  has
never served in the U.S. military. He was granted a secret clearance in 1987, held it until
1990, and was granted it again in 2013. Applicant was married in 1987, and divorced in
2002. He has been cohabiting since 2013. He has two children, born in 1989 and 1993.
Financial Considerations
Applicant  began  experiencing  financial  difficulties  in  about  2009  when  he  was
ordered  to  pay  $1,000  per  month  in  child  support.  That  amount  was  automatically
garnished from his paycheck. In 2010, and 2011, because of the child support obligation
and the reduction in his overtime hours, Applicant had insufficient funds to cover all of his
monthly bills and his residence periodically went into a foreclosure status. He was laid off
in October 2012, and he remained unemployed until March 2013. His finances improved
when he obtained his present position, and the house is no longer in a foreclosure status.
Because of limited funds, although he was aware that he might owe the Internal
Revenue  Service  (IRS)  approximately  $1,000  in  federal  income  taxes  each  year,  an
amount that he did not have, Applicant decided not to file federal income tax returns over
a  number of  years. He failed  to  timely  file federal income  tax  returns for the  tax  years
2008  through  2014,  and  he  had  not  done  so  as  of  June  2018  when  he  answered  the
SOR.1  As  a  result  of  his  non-filings,  Applicant  owes  the  IRS  substantial  back  taxes,
although the balance has been stabilized by income tax refunds for more recent years
being applied by the IRS to those unpaid taxes, while penalties and interest continue to
accrue.2  During  his  interview  with  an  investigator  from  the  U.S.  Office  of  Personnel
Management  (OPM)  in  November  2017,  Applicant  stated  that  he  would  meet  with  his
accountant  in  early  2018  to  file  those  missing  income  tax  returns.  During  the  ensuing
year, Applicant has offered no evidence to indicate that he has done so, and his Answer
to the SOR supports the conclusion that he has not done what he promised to do.3
In addition to his problems with the IRS, Applicant also failed to timely file his state
income tax returns for the tax years 2008 through 2014, and he had not done so as of
June 2018 when he answered the SOR.4 As a result of his non-filings, Applicant owes the
state  substantial  back  taxes.  In  July  2017,  the  state  department  of  revenue  started
garnishing his wages.5
In  October  2017,  Applicant  informed  the  OPM  investigator  that  his  monthly  net
salary  was  $2,532,  but  overtime  brought  it  to  $3,132;  and  his monthly  expenses  were
1 The legal requirement to file a federal income tax return is based upon an individual’s gross
income and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined that there is an obligation to so file, the
following applies:
Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title
or  by  regulations  made  under  authority  thereof  to  make  a  return,  keep  any  records,  or
supply  any  information,  who  willfully  fails  to  pay  such  estimated  tax  or  tax,  make  such
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law
or  regulations,  shall,  in  addition  to  other  penalties  provided  by  law,  be  guilty  of  a
misdemeanor  and,  upon  conviction  thereof,  shall  be  fined  not  more  than  $25,000
($100,000  in  the  case  of  a  corporation),  or  imprisoned  not  more  than  1  year,  or  both,
together  with  the  costs  of  prosecution.  In  the  case  of  any  person  with  respect  to  whom
there is a failure to pay any estimated tax, this section shall not apply to such person with
respect to such failure if there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect
to such failure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the  first
sentence of this section shall be applied by substituting "felony" for "misdemeanor" and "5
years" for "1 year."

3 It should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts
in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting
in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR

$2,841, to be reduced to $2,157 once his state back taxes are paid. He anticipated being
able to save funds to address his outstanding federal income taxes.6 It is not known what
Applicant’s  current  financial  resources  may  be  because  he  did  report  his  current  net
monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder that might be available
for  discretionary  spending  or  savings.  There  is  no  evidence  of  a  budget.  There  is  no
evidence of any financial counseling.  Applicant offered no evidence to indicate that his
financial situation is now under control.
