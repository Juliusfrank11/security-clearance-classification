In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.e,
1.g,  and  1.h.1  He  also  provided  extenuating  and  mitigating  information.  Applicant’s
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is 32 years old, and he has been employed by a defense contractor in
weapons installation since October 2016. (Tr. 6; GE 1) In 2003, he received a General
Educational Development (GED) diploma. (Tr. 6) He is currently seeking an associate’s
degree in firearms technology. (Tr. 6-7) He served in the Navy from 2004 to 2013. (Tr. 7)
His Navy specialty was aviation ordnanceman, and his rank when he was discharged was
petty officer second class (E-5). (Tr. 8) He received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 8)
Financial Considerations
Applicant had variations in his income, and a period of unemployment after leaving
the Navy. These circumstances adversely affected his finances. Applicant’s SOR alleges
the following financial issues:
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.h allege Applicant failed to timely file his federal income
tax returns for tax years 2009, 2011, and 2014. SOR ¶ 1.c alleges he failed to pay his
federal income taxes as required for tax year 2013.  SOR ¶ 1.g alleges Applicant failed
to timely file his state income tax return for tax year 2011.
1 As part of this SOR response, Applicant  provided  a  copy of a federal tax  lien filed  against his
father to establish that it was not Applicant’s tax lien. (Tr. 17-18) No adverse inference is made because of
this tax lien.
Applicant filed his federal income tax returns for each of these tax years as follows:
2009  filed  on  January  27,  2011  (Tr.  22-23,  27-28;  SOR  response);  2011  filed  in
September 2018; 2013 timely filed in April 2014 (Tr. 48; GE 2); and 2014 filed on July 21,
2017 (Tr. 33).
Applicant’s  March  22,  2018  IRS  tax  transcript  for  tax  year  2013  indicates  in
February 2016 he had additional taxes assessed of $5,007. (Tr. 34; GE 2) He explained
that  he  failed  to  include  a  withdrawal  from  his  Thrift  Savings  Program  account  on  his
income tax return resulting in additional taxes for “unreported income.” (Tr. 33; GE 2) His
federal  income  tax  refund  for  tax  year  2015  ($1,271)  and  2016  ($1,593)  were  used  to
address  his  delinquent  taxes  for  tax  year  2013.  (Tr.  34;  SOR  response)  The  IRS
apparently waived some fees and charges because his 2018 IRS tax transcript for tax
year  2013  shows  a  zero  pay  off  amount.  (GE  2)  A  February  27,  2017  IRS  letter  also
indicates his tax debt for tax year 2013 has a zero balance. (GE 2) His federal income tax
debt for tax year 2013 is resolved.
Applicant was deployed as part of his Navy duties for most of 2010 and the first
few months of 2011. (Tr. 24, 26-27, 29; SOR response) He was waiting for the state to
provide a copy of his W-2 so he could file his state tax return for tax year 2011. (Tr. 25,
30, 45) He was unable to get a W-2 from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service
(DFAS).  (Tr.  46)  Applicant’s  state  tax  return  has  not  been  filed  as  of  the  date  of  his
hearing. (Tr. 25, 45-46)
Applicant timely filed his federal income tax returns for tax years 2007, 2008, 2010,
2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. (SOR response; GE 2) He received a refund for all of
these tax years. (SOR response; GE 2)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  Applicant  has  a  charged-off  debt  owed  to  a  credit  union  for
$22,983. In 2012, Applicant borrowed funds to purchase a vehicle. (Tr. 35) The vehicle
was  not  repossessed.  (Tr.  38)  He  stopped  making  payments  for  a  time,  and  then  in
September 2017, he resumed making $200 monthly payments. (Tr. 35, 37) The account
is in current status.
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a charged-off debt for $7,245. From May 2017 to April 2018,
Applicant paid the creditor $200 monthly, and then in April 2018, the creditor offered to
settle the remaining debt for $3,000. (Tr. 40-41) In April 2018, Applicant paid $3,000 and
settled the debt. (Tr. 41)
Personal Conduct
When Applicant completed his October 4, 2016 SCA, he failed to disclose that he
did not timely file his federal or state tax returns in 2011. Applicant said at the time he
completed his SCA, he had forgotten that he did not timely file his tax returns. (Tr. 42-43)
On November 16, 2017, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator
asked him during his personal subject interview (PSI) whether he failed to file or pay his
federal  or  state taxes.  (Tr.  47; GE 2)  Applicant  disclosed  that  he did not  timely  file  his
federal income taxes for tax year 2013, and he said he paid his tax debt for that year in
February 2017. (Tr. 47; GE 2) He did not disclose that at the time of his PSI he failed to
file his federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2011. At his hearing, he said he
could not remember why he did not disclose to the OPM investigator that he had not filed
his federal income tax return for tax year 2011. (Tr. 47; GE 2) 2
