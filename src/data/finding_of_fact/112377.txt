Applicant, age 44, is single. She obtained her associate’s degree in 2000, and has
been studying for her undergraduate degree for a few years. She is not attending classes
at this time.  She is a senior administrative assistant for a defense contractor. Applicant
completed her security clearance application (SCA) on March 28, 2016. (GE 1) She has
held  a  security  clearance  for  about  12  years.  (GE  1)  She  has  worked  for  her  current
employer since June 2018. She previously worked as a contractor since about 2005. (Tr.
18)
The SOR alleges in 1.a through 1.n, 14 delinquent debts totaling about $34,000,
which include four student loan accounts, charged-off consumer accounts, and medical
accounts. (GE 2-4) Applicant admitted the SOR allegations and provided explanations for
each one. (Answer)
FINANCIAL
Applicant acknowledged her financial hardship, and explained that she believed
her finances were under control when she submitted her SCA, but explained that six knee
surgeries,  other  medical  issues  in  2016  through  2018,  including  a  back  surgery,  2016
sexual assaults in the workplace, and lost days of paid employment for months resulted
in her current delinquent debt. (Tr. 8) Applicant missed many days of employment due to
the  workplace  issue  and  did  not  have  a  full  paycheck  for  about  one  and  a  half  years.
Applicant was unemployed when she left the workplace after the late 2016-2017 sexual
assaults  and  took  a  reduction  in  pay  in  her  next  job.  (Tr.  22)  She  has  spoken  to  a
bankruptcy attorney, but she does want to pay her debts. (Tr. 9) She is in the process of
consolidating student loans.
Applicant  recounted  how  the  sexual  assaults  at  work  led  to  depression  and
because she was afraid to report the incidents to her employer, she would take sick days
maybe one or two days a week. (Tr. 21-24) She spoke to an attorney and had a case
worker and found the experience traumatic. Her emotional instability prevented her from
concentrating on her finances. This was the time period of 2016-2017 before she looked
for other employment. She knows that she has to take full responsibility for the financial
situation.
Applicant has paid the following SOR accounts: 1.j, an account in the amount of
$581; 1.e, an account in the amount of $1,126; 1.f, a medical account in the amount of
$245;  1.g,  a  medical  account  in  the  amount  of  $103;  1.h,  a  collection  account  in  the
amount of $89; 1.i, a medical account in the amount of $181; and 1.n, a phone account
in the amount of $202. (AE D-F)
Applicant has the following SOR accounts in a payment plan: 1.a, a charged-off
account in the amount of $11,215 that has a term of 45 monthly payments of $250. (AE
A) SOR 1.c, a charged-off account in the amount of $5,536 that has a term of 44 monthly
payments of $125. (AE B) Applicant has made one or two payments on each account,
but did not provide documentation.
As to the student loans at issue, SOR 1.b, 1.d, 1.k, and 1.l, Applicant believes they
total about $25,000. (Tr. 32) She started making payments on the loans but stopped in
2016. (Tr.32)  Her student loans are not in deferment as she is not taking any classes.
Applicant’s intention was to return to class, but that did not occur.  She has been in contact
with the Department of Education and is in the process of arranging a payment plan that
she  can  afford.  At  the  present  time,  she  cannot  afford  the  offered  $700  a  month.  A
collection agency now is handling the loans and Applicant has been in touch with them
and hoping for a $300 a month payment. This has not been approved. (Tr. 35)
Applicant admitted that she was indebted to a state university for a registered class
that she did not take and did not timely withdraw. (SOR 1.m) The amount owed is $1,797.
She  explained  that  she  has  not  attempted  to  resolve  this  account.  She  explained  that
there were times when she was depressed that she did not open her mail. (Tr. 42)
Applicant is working with her father to develop a budget and a strategy to handle
her finances. She earns about $70,000 a year and lives with her two brothers. She has
no  new  delinquent  debt  and  no  car  loan.    Applicant  has  also  spoken  to  the  collection
agent  for  the  student  loans  concerning  financial  counseling.  She  has  a  monthly  net
remainder of about $365 after expenses. She has health insurance.
