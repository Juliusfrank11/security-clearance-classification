The SOR lists three allegations under the financial considerations guideline: SOR
1.a - Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in September 2016; SOR 1.b - a
delinquent  credit  union  debt;  and  SOR  1.c  –  a  delinquent  medical  debt.  Applicant
admitted the three allegations and provided explanations.
Applicant is 39 years old and divorced. Since 1999, he has been earning college
credits  and  is  one  course  short  of  receiving  his  bachelor’s  degree.  He  served  in  the
United  States  (US)  Navy  from  March  2000  to  March  2004,  receiving  an  honorable
discharge.  Applicant  has  been  continually  employed  from  2005  to  the  present.  During
that  time,  he  has  received  several  training  certificates  in  connection  with  his
employment.  Since  June 2007, Applicant has  been  working  in  communication  security
for several different  defense  contractors.  He  has  no  issues  with  his security  clearance
which he has held since 2000. (GE 1 at 10-11, 11-13, 17-18, 41; Tr. 56-60, 62)
In December 2013, Applicant purchased a home (HX) for $420,000 in his name,
though  his  then-girlfriend  provided  unexplained  financial  help  with  the  purchase.  He
financed the entire amount of the purchase with a Veterans Affairs (VA) loan at a fixed
interest  rate.  His  then-girlfriend  paid  the  utilities  and  food,  and  Applicant  paid  the
mortgage and insurance. At the time of the purchase of HX, Applicant was renting out a
townhouse (not listed in the SOR) that he had purchased in 2005. After his girlfriend left
him  in  March  2014,  Applicant  had  trouble  managing  all  the  financial  responsibilities  of
HX.  His  financial  problems  increased  in  December  2014  or  January  2015,  when  his
renters  moved  out  of  the  townhouse  and  Applicant  was  unable  to  rent  the  property.
After the first and second mortgages on the townhouse became delinquent, he sold the
townhouse  in  a  short-sale.  The  resulting  deficiency  balance  after  the  short-sale  was
forgiven by the mortgage lender. (GE 1 at 42; GE 2 at 4; Tr. 50, 65-69)
SOR  1.a  –  Following  his  March  2014  breakup,  and  losing  the  renters  of  his
townhouse,  Applicant  began  misusing  credit  cards  to  supplement  his  income  so  he
could  pay  bills.  In  September  2016,  Applicant  filed  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  petition,
listing $457,000 in liabilities and assets of $390,580. He included HX ($420,000) in the
Chapter  13  petition,  along  with  a  car  loan,  utility  accounts,  medical  accounts,  and  two
federal credit union accounts. One of the credit union accounts was a credit card (SOR
1.b), and one was a personal loan (unlisted). The payment terms of the plan were: $325
a  month for the first  14  months;  $400  a month  for months  15  through  17;  and  $965 a
month for 43 months for a total of 60 months. The payment plan began in October 2016.
In  June  2017,  he  moved  out  of  HX  and  rented  the  property  for  $3,000  a  month  until
June 2018. The Chapter 13 petition plan was confirmed in September 2017. (GE 2 at 6-
7; GE 5 at 13; Tr. 72, 75)
Applicant  testified  that  in  September  2018,  HX  was  placed  under contract  for  a
short-sale.  The  contract  price  was  $420,000,  and  Applicant  owed  $428,000  on  the
mortgage. He indicated that the buyer requested a 60-day approval process. Applicant
contacted the mortgage lender on October 29, 2018, and was told they were waiting on
an  unidentified document.  He did  not have  a  set  date for finalization  of the  short-sale,
but assumed it would be before December 2018. There are several emails between the
realtor  and  Applicant,  but  no  emails  showing  that  the  mortgage  lender  finalized  the
short-sale, or that the process would be completed before December 2018. (AE C; Tr.
52-53)
Although  Applicant  claimed  that  he  decided  to  place  HX  on  the  market  shortly
after  he  filed  the  Chapter  13  petition  in  September  2016,  all  documentation  related  to
his efforts to sell HX occurred in 2018. Applicant seemed to modify his earlier decision
to  sell  by  indicating  that  he  wanted  to  exhaust  all  avenues  to  keep  HX.  One  of  those
avenues was to acquire tenants (which he did between June 2017 and June 2018)  for
HX to generate extra money to pay bills and meet  the Chapter 13 plan payments. (Tr.
88-89)
On October 4, 2018, the Chapter 13 trustee filed a Motion to Dismiss the Chapter
13  Petition  and  Notice  of  an  Opportunity  for  a  Hearing.  The  trustee  indicated  that
Applicant had defaulted on $2,850 in plan payments. Applicant admitted that he missed
two plan payments. Also, Applicant failed to provide the trustee a copy of his 2016 and
2017 federal tax returns as required by the terms of the Chapter 13 order. Applicant was
given until October 25, 2018, to provide a responsive pleading to the trustee’s  motion,
together  with  a  request  for  a  hearing,  or  the  case  could  be  dismissed  on  October  25,
2018. The record contains no documentation of a response by Applicant to the motion.
(GE 5 at 11; GE 7)
The Chapter 13 payment history, which appears at the last page of the October
2018  motion  to  dismiss,  lists  the  payments  Applicant  made  (and  missed)  between
October  2016  and  September  2018.  Applicant  attributed  the  missed  payments  to
oversight.  In  addition,  he  complained  to  his  bankruptcy  lawyer  that  the  payment  plan
amounts remained at the same level even after the renters of HX between June 2017
and June 2018, moved out in June 2018. Without the rental income, it was more difficult
to  make the higher plan  payments.  Applicant  made  the  $965 payment  on  October 25,
2018. (GE 7; Tr. 80-87, 93, 97)
Though Applicant provided no documentation, he testified that a hearing date on
the  motion  to  dismiss  the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  case  was  scheduled  for  December
2018.  He  plans  to  have  the  short-sale  of  HX  finalized  before  the  hearing.  Then,  his
bankruptcy attorney can inform the bankruptcy court that HX is no longer a liability and
should be removed from the Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 91-92)
SOR  1.b  –  This  credit  card  account  that  Applicant  opened  in  2012,  became
delinquent in August 2016. The account is past due in the amount of $4,449, with a total
balance of $11,678. The account is listed in Applicant’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition.
(AE E; Tr. 94)
SOR  1.c  –  This  medical  account  ($1,880)  became  delinquent  in  2017  and  was
placed for collection. Applicant’s documentation shows that he made a payment of $103
in  May,  $216  in  August,  and  $216  in  October  2018.  In the future,  Applicant  intends  to
use  the  creditor’s  website  to  make  future  payments.  Besides  the  accounts  listed  in
SOR,  Applicant  has  an  unlisted  delinquent  cell  phone  bill  amounting  to  $670.  The  bill
represents an outstanding balance with his former service provider that his new service
provider promised to pay when he switched service. (AE B; Tr. 97-102)
Applicant’s  budget  since  August  2018  has  a  net  monthly  remainder  of  $470  a
month.  His  savings  account  is  depleted  to  about  $200  after  he  paid  a  $1,000  home
owners association bill. He exhausted his retirement account in 2014. He has only one
corporate  credit  card  which  he  uses  on  work  trips.  Applicant  has  had  no  additional
financial  counseling  since  the  mandated  counseling  he  received  when  he  filed  his
Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in September 2016. (GE 1 at 43; AE A; Tr. 102-107)
Character Evidence
The audit chief for a branch of a federal agency has known Applicant for a long
time as an employee and does not believe he is a security risk. He should be allowed
time to resolve his mishandling of unidentified financial matters. (AE F) The branch chief
for the same federal agency as the audit chief indicated that he has known Applicant for
14  years  and  states  that  Applicant  is  not  a  security  risk.  Applicant  counseled  with  the
branch  chief  about  filing  bankruptcy  in  August  2016.  The  branch  chief  advised  him  to
inform his facility security officer and disclose everything about the process. (AE G)
