In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations except SOR ¶
1.h, which he denied. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  43-year-old  solution  developer  employed  by  a  federal  contractor
since January 2015. He received a bachelor’s degree in May 1999 and a master’s degree
in  May  2004.  He  worked  as  a  software  developer  for  a  private-sector  employer  from
January  2006  to  November  2011,  when  he  was  laid  off.  He  was  unemployed  from
November 2011 to January 2013. He was self-employed from January 2013 to January
2015, when he accepted his current position. He has never held a security clearance.
Applicant has never married and has no children. He provided no information about
his income and expenses while self-employed or since his current employment in January
2015.
The SOR alleges 20 delinquent debts totaling about $443,600. It includes seven
default judgments totaling about $330,206, of which six are unsatisfied. The court records
reflect that the default judgments were entered after notices were sent to the addresses
for  Applicant’s  rental  properties,  posted  on  the  rental  properties,  sent  to  his  mother’s
home,  where  he  lived  from  2006-2009,  sent  to  his  residence  from  2009-2015,  sent  to
Applicant’s post office box, and served by publication. (FORM Items 7-13.)
Many of the debts are related to Applicant’s investments in rental properties. The
debts are reflected in court records (FORM Items 7-13) and credit reports from October
2015 (FORM Item 5) and December 2017 (FORM Item 6.) The evidence concerning the
debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
1  Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  security  clearance  application  (GX  3)  unless
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
SOR  ¶  1.a:  judgment  for  $10,115,  filed  in  November  2010.  This  is  a  default
judgment for a delinquent credit-card account. (FORM Item 7.) During the February 2017
PSI, Applicant told an investigator that he was unable to pay this debt because he was
unemployed at the time and had other financial obligations. (FORM Item 4 at 9.) The debt
is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.b:  judgment  for  $44,999,  filed  in  November  2011.  This  is  a  default
judgment for a delinquent mortgage loan on a rental property. The October 2016 credit
report  reflects  that  the  property  was  sold  after  foreclosure  and  the  debt  has  a  zero
balance. (FORM Item 5 at 6.) This judgment is satisfied.
SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.g: judgments for $60,981, filed in February 2012; $42,547, filed
in August 2013; $35,081, filed in August 2013; $42,200, filed in January 2015; and
$94,283, filed in June 2015. These are default judgments for delinquent mortgage loans
on rental properties. Applicant attributed these delinquencies to his unemployment from
November 2011 to January 2013 and inability to find renters for his properties. (FORM
Item 4 at 10-11.) In Applicant’s SCA, he stated that the lender foreclosed on the property
in  SOR  ¶  1.f  (judgment  for  $42,200),  but  he  submitted  no  evidence  to  support  his
statement. (GX 3 at 45.) These judgments are not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.h:  collection  account  for  $23,836.  The  credit  report  from  May  2016
reflects that this debt is a delinquent student loan being collected by garnishment. (FORM
Item 5 at 3-4.) In the February 2017 PSI, Applicant told an investigator that he fell behind
on  his  payments  because  he  was  laid  off.  (FORM  Item  4  at  10-11.)  The  debt  is  not
resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.i:  line  of  credit  charged  off  for  $9,479.  In  the  February  2017  PSI,
Applicant  told  an  investigator  that  he  did  not  intend  to  pay  this  debt  because  it  was
charged off. (FORM Item 4 at 10.) This debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.j: collection account for $1,129. This debt is not reflected on the credit
reports in the record. This allegation is not supported by the evidence.
SOR  ¶¶  1.k,  1.q,  1.r,  1.s,  and  1.u:  utility  bills  placed  for  collection  of  $364,
$292,  $88,  and  $73  (two  bills).  These  debts  were  incurred  when  Applicant’s  tenants
failed to transfer the accounts to their names or failed to pay the bills. (FORM Item 3 at
44; Form Item 4 at 12-14.) They are not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.l: collection account for $35,706. This debt is a delinquent credit-card
account. It is not resolved. (FORM Item 4 at 10.)
SOR ¶ 1.m: collection account for $32,575. This debt is a delinquent student
loan being collected by garnishment. (FORM Item 5 at 3.) It is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.n: credit-card account charged off for $8,605. In the February 2017
PSI, Applicant told an investigator that he did not intend to pay this debt because it was
charged off. (FORM Item 4 at 12.) It is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.o: debt to credit union charged off for $285. This debt is an overdraft
charge. (FORM Item 4 at 13.) It is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.p: credit-card account placed for collection of $916. In the February
2017 PSI, Applicant acknowledged this debt. (FORM Item 4 at 12.) It is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.t: telecommunications account placed for collection of $49. This debt
is reflected in the October 2016 credit report. (FORM Item 5 at 12.) In the February 2017
PSI, Applicant was unable to identify this debt. (FORM Item 4 at 15.) It is not resolved.
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he asserted that the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶
1.h and 1.i were duplicates. It is unclear whether the same lending institution is involved
in both debts. However, the evidence shows that the debts are not duplicates. The debt
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h is a student loan, and the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i is a line of credit.
