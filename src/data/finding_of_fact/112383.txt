Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 29 years old. He is a high school graduate, and attended some college
classes between 2007 and 2010. He has worked for his employer, a federal contractor,
since October 2016. He is unmarried and has a ten-year-old child. He is current on his
child support obligation. (Item 2.)
Applicant was employed from 2012 to 2016 as a forklift operator. Before that, he
worked  in  retail  from  2008  to  2012.  He  also  worked  at  a  fast  food  restaurant  in  2008.
These jobs were low paying positions and did not afford him sufficient income to repay
his student loans that he incurred while attending college. (Item 2; Item 3.)
Applicant is alleged to be indebted on 11 delinquent student loan accounts (SOR
¶¶ 1.a-1.d, and 1.f-1.l) owed to the U.S. Department of Education, totaling $32,442. He
presented  a  payment  agreement  with  a  collection  agency  for  the  U.S.  Department  of
Education  dated  April  26,  2018,  with  his  Answer  to  the  SOR.  That  letter  authorized
recurring payments to be withdrawn from his account, but did not state a payment amount
or otherwise document any payments were made under that agreement. In Applicant’s
Response,  he  indicated  that  he  consolidated  his  delinquent  student  loans  into  one
account  and  that  since  April  2018,  he  has  remitted  $22  per  month  as  required  in  the
repayment agreement. His June 5, 2018 credit report reflects multiple accounts owed to
the Department of Education as past due with the date of last payment as April 2018. It
is  unclear  if  he  made  any  payments  after  his  the  April  2018  payment,  which  was
presumably the first payment under his repayment agreement. His June 5, 2018 credit
report also shows multiple other student loans were transferred or sold. Applicant did not
provide enough evidence to establish a track record of responsibility for these delinquent
student loan accounts. These debts are unresolved. (Answer; Response; Item 3; Item 4;
Item 5; Item 6.)
Applicant  also  owes  approximately  $2,812  (SOR  ¶  1.e)  to  the  university  he
attended  for  another  student  loan.  His  Answer  and  Response  indicate  that  all  of  his
student loans have been “consolidated into one monthly payment plan” but there is no
evidence  that  indicates  this  debt  was  included  in  that  agreement.  This  debt  became
delinquent in 2011. It is identified on his June 5, 2018 credit report as past due and no
recent payments are reflected. This debt is unresolved. (Answer; Response; Item 3 at 7;
Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.)
Additionally, Applicant is indebted to the IRS in the amount of $5,284 for tax years
2014, 2015, and 2016, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.m. He filed his tax returns for those years
in a timely manner, but had insufficient funds to pay the balance owed. Tax transcripts for
those  tax  years  reflect  that  he  established  an  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS  to
resolve his delinquencies in April 2017, but was no longer in installment status in March
2018. (Item 3.) He documented that he re-engaged the IRS in April 2018 and established
a new agreement to pay $64 per month. (Answer.) In his Response, he indicated he was
current  with  that agreement, but provided  no  documentation  to  show  a  track  record  of
payments under that agreement.
Applicant’s June 5, 2018 credit report reflects that he has an additional delinquent
account, owed to a payday-loan vender in the amount of $616. (Item 6.)1 He admitted this
debt  in  his  Response  and  explained:  “In  my  current  financial  situation,  I  am  living
‘paycheck to paycheck’, meaning, after I am finished paying my monthly rent and utilities
and  other  expenses  that  are  required  raising  my  son,  I  am  not  left  with  extra  funds.”
Despite  his  shortfall,  he  intends  to  pay  all  his  delinquent  debt  when  he  is  able.
