In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d through
1.n.  (HE  3)  She  also  provided  extenuating  and  mitigating  information.  Applicant’s
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 56-year-old supply quality engineer, and she has been employed by
her  current  defense-contractor  employer  since  August  2017.  (Tr.  5-6;  GE  1)  She  has
never served in the military. (Tr. 6) In 1987, she married, and her children are ages 24
and 27. (Tr. 6) Her husband has driven a truck for several years, and he has been an
owner-operator of a truck for the previous two years. (Tr. 7)
In  1981,  Applicant  graduated  from  high  school,  and  in  1986,  she  received  a
bachelors of science degree in electrical engineering. (Tr. 7-8) She has held a security
clearance for 28 years, and there is no evidence that she ever compromised security. (Tr.
19)
Financial Considerations
Applicant attributed most of her financial problems, including her federal income
tax  debts,  to  her  unemployment  for  about  30  months  and  her  husband’s  occasional
unemployment.  (Tr.  8-9,  22)  She  was  unemployed  from  2014  to  2016  and  for  several
months in 2017 until August 2017. (Tr. 8-9) She was continuously employed from 1986
to  2013  by  two  large  defense  contractors.  (Tr.  8-9)  Applicant  and  her  husband  have
separate  households  in  different  states  because  of  employment  requirements,  which
results  in  additional  expenses.  (Tr.  26)  Applicant’s  SOR  alleges  the  following  financial
issues:
SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c allege Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax
returns for tax years 2011, 2012, and 2016. Her 2011 federal income tax return was filed
three months late. (Tr. 27) She provided an IRS Form 1040 for her 2012 federal income
tax return, and it is undated. (AE C) Her federal income tax transcript shows her 2016
federal income tax return was timely filed. (AE D)
SOR  ¶¶  1.d  through  1.g  allege  Applicant  owes  federal  income  taxes  totaling
$40,828,  for  the  following  amounts  and  tax  years:  $13,695  for  2009;  $4,674  for  2010;
$4,050  for  2011;  and  $18,409  for  2014.  She  made  payments  to  the  IRS  under  an
installment program from October 2015 to April 2017. (Tr. 22-23) She stopped making
payments  in  April  2017,  due  to  unemployment.  (Tr.  23-24)  Her  payments  under  the
installment agreement may also have been affected by her Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing.
(Tr. 25) She currently owes the IRS about $75,000. (Tr. 25) In July or August 2018, she
contacted the IRS and attempted to establish another installment agreement; however,
“it fell through.” (Tr. 25-26) Applicant did not know why it was not reestablished. (Tr. 26)
Her most recent payment to the IRS under an installment agreement was in April 2017.
(Tr. 27)
SOR  ¶  1.h  alleges  Applicant filed a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  in  about  September
2016, and the bankruptcy was dismissed in about February 2017. Applicant completed
financial  counseling.  (Tr. 29) The  bankruptcy  court  wanted her to pay  $1,600 monthly,
and  she  considered  this  amount  to  be  unaffordable.  (Tr.  29)  The  bankruptcy  was
dismissed. (Tr. 29; GE 8)
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges Applicant had a mortgage in the amount of $448,867, and her
mortgage  was  foreclosed  around  2016.  For  one  year,  Applicant  made  her  mortgage
payments using funds from her 401(k) account. (Tr. 30) During her unemployment, she
was unable to make payments on her mortgage, and she had “to walk away.” (Tr. 31)
She did not know how much the bank lost on the sale of her home. (Tr. 31) Her Chapter
13  documentation  filed  in  September  2016,  indicated  the  value  of  her  residence  was
$293,609, the amount of the mortgage debts were first mortgage: $417,160 and second
mortgage: $24,800, and the unsecured portion of the debt was about $148,000. (GE 8 at
17-18)  As  of  May  3,  2017,  her  mortgage  arrearage  was  $32,121.  (GE  9  at  3)  The
mortgage debt is listed on her October 19, 2018 credit report as a foreclosure account
with  a  last  payment  in  February  2016,  a  balance  of  $448,867;  however,  the  past  due
amount is zero. (GE 5) The current status of the two mortgage accounts is unspecified in
her October 19, 2018 credit report. From the information submitted, I infer the foreclosure
has been completed, and there is no proof of a deficiency. The debt is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.j alleges an account placed for collection for $80. Applicant said she paid
this debt. (SOR response) The debt is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.k alleges a past-due debt of $693 on a vehicle loan for $17,892. Applicant
indicated she was not current on her vehicle payments. (Tr. 31; AE A, email of Feb. 8,
2019) She said she would provide evidence after the hearing showing the status of the
debt; however, she did not provide it. (Tr. 32)
SOR ¶ 1.l alleges a delinquent debt owed to a city for $2,503; SOR ¶ 1.m alleges
a delinquent debt owed to a county for $1,765; and SOR ¶ 1.n alleges a delinquent debt
owed to a school district for $4,727. These three debts relate to her residence that was
foreclosed.  (Tr.  32-33)  While  those  three  debts  may  have  been  paid  by  the  mortgage
lender to ensure clear title for the transfer of the property, Applicant may still owe them.
(Tr. 33) Applicant did not provide updated status information on the three debts. The three
debts are unresolved.
Applicant and her husband’s adjusted gross income on their 2015 federal income
tax return was $175,760, and she indicated that part of this income included funds from
her 401(k) account. (Tr. 36) She owed the IRS $22,000 for tax year 2015. (Tr. 36-37)
Applicant’s  budget  shows  the  following  monthly  amounts:  gross  income  of
$12,600;  net  income  of  $10,071;  expenses  of  $5,801;  debt  payments  of  $1,579  (no
payment to the IRS listed); and net remainder of $2,620. (AE E)
A manager where Applicant is employed described Applicant as diligent and highly
motivated  with  exceptional  potential.  He  is  a  retired  Navy  officer,  and  he  supports
reinstatement  of  her  security  clearance.  (AE  G)  Another  manager  lauded  her  work
performance, positive attitude, and effectiveness. (AE H)
Applicant’s post-hearing statement concluded:
I am not trying to avoid my responsibilities, and I am embarrassed that I am
even in this position in the first place. To begin this process, I am trying to
work  with  the  IRS  as  well  as  a  credit  management  company.  I  have  the
upmost respect for my Country and my company and would not put either
at risk. Just as I love and respect my family and self that is how dearly I hold
the responsibility of the clearance. I know if given the opportunity I can work
on my finances and clear the concerns that this has set for the granting of
the Security Clearance. (AE F)
