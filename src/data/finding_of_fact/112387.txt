Applicant is 43 years old and never married. She graduated from high school in
1992, and attended college for two years. She has a 19-year-old daughter from a previous
relationship.  She  started  working  for  her  current  employer,  a  defense  contractor,  in
August 2016. Prior to this position, she experienced periods of unemployment between

On  September  13,  2016,  Applicant  submitted  a  security  clearance  application
(SCA).  In  it,  she  disclosed  a  garnishment,  a  bankruptcy,  and  delinquent  accounts,
including several medical debts. She stated that she could not afford to pay many of them
because she was supporting other people and unemployed at times. She disclosed that
she  filed  bankruptcy  in  January  2010  and  subsequently  discharged  about  $11,000  in
delinquent debts. (Item 2)
On September 6, 2017, a government investigator interviewed Applicant about her
background and information in her SCA, including financial matters. (Item 3) During the
interview, she said that she filed bankruptcy because she was a single parent and could
not pay all of her daughter’s medical bills and their living expenses. She used credit cards
to pay bills at times. It is unknown if she received child support. (Item 3)
In her April 23, 2018 answer to the SOR, Applicant acknowledged that she had
been financially irresponsible in the past. However, she stated that she has since learned
to live within her means and has used a well-known financial management system to help
resolve debts. She submitted several documents with her answer indicating that she had
been making payments on some medical debts that were not alleged in the SOR. She
also noted that in July 2017 she paid off two open credit cards. (Item 1)

and $2,562. She intended to begin the plan in November 2018, and have the debts paid
by August 2019. (AE A) In her March 27, 2019 submission, Applicant stated that she was
