In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 39-year-old tactical communicator employed by defense contractors
since June 2012. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from October 1998 to June
2012, attained the rank of staff sergeant, and received an honorable discharge because
of his inability to maintain weight standards due to a medical condition. He is taking online
college courses and expects to receive his bachelor’s degree by the end of 2018. (Tr. 31-
32.)  He  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  1998  and  received  eligibility for  access to
sensitive compartmented information (SCI) in November 2008. (Tr. 34.)
Applicant  enlisted  in  the  Army  National  Guard  in  1997  and  was  assigned  to  a
Special Forces unit. He was assigned to an installation in the United States from 1998 to
2001. During this time he was single and followed the “Sam Walton” practice: “If you can’t
afford it, you don’t buy it.” From 2001 until 2012, he was deployed most of the time. He
married in 2004, and has two children from the marriage, ages 14 and 11. He trusted his
wife  to  manage  the  family  finances  while  he  was  deployed.  (Tr.  27.)  His  wife  incurred
several of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR and used a power of attorney to open
accounts in his name without his knowledge. (Tr. 53.) Except for the debt alleged in SOR
¶ 1.d, he did not specifically identify which accounts were opened without his knowledge
or consent. He has not disputed any of the debts alleged in the SOR.
The SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts totaling about $27,000, which are reflected
in credit reports from August 2016 (GX 2) and February 2018 (GX 3). In October 2017,
Applicant and his wife joined a personal finance counseling group that met weekly. They
completed the program December 2017. The leader of the counseling group considers
Applicant and his wife as “one of the success stories” for the counseling group. (Answer

otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
to SOR; AX A.) The counseling program assigns a sponsor to each participant. Applicant
testified that he meets with his sponsor about every two weeks to review his progress.
(Tr. 71.) He testified that he received financial counseling while he was on active duty,
but he enrolled in the most recent course so that his wife would attend it. His wife now
understands that “debt doesn’t have to be a lifestyle.” (Tr. 44.) Their plan is to set aside
$1,000 per month and use it to pay off delinquent debts. (Tr. 69.)
Applicant’s take-home pay is about $5,556 per month, and he receives disability
pay of $1,809 per month. His wife has been employed since September 2017, and her
take-home  pay  is  about  $1,750  per  month.  Their  monthly  budget  accounts  for  all  their
monthly income. It provides for payments on the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d,
1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k, and a monthly contribution of $1,096.50 to an “emergency fund. (Tr.

him,  testified  that  Applicant  is  “one  of  the  most  thrifty,  cost-conscious,  less  excessive
personalities”  that  he  has  encountered.  He  has  no  reason  to  question  Applicant’s
reliability or trustworthiness. (Tr. 19-25.)
