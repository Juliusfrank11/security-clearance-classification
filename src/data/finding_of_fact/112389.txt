Applicant is 28 years old. She is a high school graduate. She has worked for her
employer since August 2017. (Item 3.)
On June 8, 2017, Applicant was involuntarily terminated by her prior employer for
stealing  money  from  another  employee’s  purse.  She  indicated  she  “immediately
regretted” her decision and “tried to put the money back” but was caught in the act. A
disciplinary action form from Applicant’s former employer documents the theft. (Item 5;
Answer.)
The SOR alleged that Applicant’s material, intentional false statement, deception,
or fraud raised concerns under DoDI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, Appendix 2, Supplemental
Adjudicative Standards. Specifically, it alleged that Applicant falsified material facts on a
Declaration for Federal Employment form (306), signed by Applicant on September 26,
2017,  when she failed  to  disclose she  was discharged  by  her  employer  in  June  2017.
She answered  “No”  on  that  declaration  to  the  question  that  asked  whether  in  the  past
five  years  she  had  been fired,  quit  after  being  told  she  would  be fired,  or  left  a  job  by
mutual  agreement  because  of  specific  problems.  She  admitted  that  she  “didn’t  think
[she] would get the job if [she] checked yes.” (Item 4; Answer.)
Applicant expressed remorse for being dishonest. She has worked hard to be a
top performer for her current employer. (Answer.)
Applicant  presented  four  letters  of  recommendation  from  supervisors  and
coworkers.  The first  letter  indicated  that  Applicant  was  recognized  as  the  employee of
the  month  during  her  first  90  days  of  employment  and  is  trustworthy.  Her  program
manager believes she has dedication, character, and dependability required for the job.
Her  deputy  program  manager  finds  her  character  to  be  “beyond  reproach.”  Her  team
lead  believes  Applicant  to  be  honest,  hardworking,  and  a  motivated  team  player.
