Applicant is 38 years old. He married his second wife in September 2017. They
have two children, and he has two children from his first marriage. Applicant was married
to his first wife from 2006 until March 2017, though the parties separated in May 2012.
He has received both a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Bachelor of Science degree. He
has  worked for his current  employer since 2006 and  wishes  to  retain  national security
eligibility  for  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  that  employment.  (Government
Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A and 17; Applicant Exhibit B; Tr. 22-25.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  failed  to  meet  his  financial  obligations  and  is  therefore  potentially
unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a, 1.j, 1.p, and 1.q. He denied SOR allegations 1.m
and  1.n.  Applicant  admitted  in  part  and  denied  in  part  the  debts  set  forth  in  SOR
allegations 1.b through 1.i, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.o. The existence and amounts of all of the debts
are set forth in credit bureau reports dated July 26, 2016; and May 11, 2018. (Government
Exhibits 5 and 6.)
Applicant argued that a long and arduous divorce proceeding from his now ex-wife
was the primary cause of all of his financial issues. According to Applicant, he had to pay
excessive spouse and child support, as well as his ex-wife’s attorney fees. Eventually, he
was unable to maintain payments on his debts. Only recently has he been able to begin
to resolve his debts. (Applicant Exhibits G, H, and K; Tr. 26-29, 59-62.)
The current status of the debts is as follows:
1.a. Applicant admitted that he owed several unpaid student loans, as set forth in
this allegation and SOR allegation 1.j. Applicant entered into a rehabilitation agreement
concerning all of his student loans, totaling approximately $61,646. Beginning in March
2018, Applicant began making monthly payments of $240 a month. Applicant had made
seven payments as of the date the record closed. Once he has made nine payments in
ten months, his loans will be taken out of default status and then regular payments can
begin. His actions are sufficient to show a good-faith effort to resolve this debt. This debt
is being resolved through agreed payments. (Applicant Exhibits V and L; Tr. 28-34, 79-
80, 88-89.)
1.b. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed $15,958 for a past-
due credit card bill. He admitted to this allegation on the record, and that he had not made
any payments towards it. Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt relief company
on  August  16,  2018,  to  attempt  to  resolve  this  and  other  past-due  indebtedness.  The
agreement posits that Applicant will make monthly payments of $290, out of which the
debt  relief  company  will  attempt  to  make  payment  arrangements  with  his  creditors.
Applicant made his first payment on September 7, 2018, which is the only one before the
record closed. One payment is insufficient to show that Applicant has made a good-faith
effort to resolve this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 34-36, 39-40, 81-83; Applicant
Exhibit BB.)
