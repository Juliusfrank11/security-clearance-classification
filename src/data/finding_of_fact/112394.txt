Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 56 years old. He earned an associate’s degree in 1981. He served in
the military from 1982 to 1989 and was honorably discharged. He is pursuing a bachelor’s
degree. He married in 1982. He has two adult children, ages 35 and 23 years old. Both
live with him. His oldest child, a daughter, has three children. She is separated from her
husband. She and her children live with Applicant. His daughter does not receive child
support. She sporadically contributes to the household.2
Applicant began experiencing financial difficulties in 2015. He purchased a house
in July 2015. Shortly thereafter, he and his wife had marital problems. He moved out of
the  house  in  December  2015.  His  wife  has  medical  issues  and  is  unable  to  work.  In
January  2016,  his  daughter  lost  her  job  and  moved  in  with  Applicant’s  wife.  Applicant
started supporting two households, which included his daughter’s family. This had a major
impact on his finances. He lost his job in August 2017. He maintained the two households
until he and his wife reconciled in November 2017, and he moved back into their house.3
In 2014, Applicant moved to a different state for a job. He withdrew money from
his  pension  plan  and  believed  the  federal  income  tax  was  paid  at  the  time  of  his
withdrawal. In 2015, he learned that he owed more federal income taxes as the amount
was not fully paid (SOR ¶ 1.a-$21,578). He testified that he contacted the company that
was handling his pension plan and was told that only a percentage of the tax was paid.
He contacted the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and arranged an installment agreement
to pay the taxes owed. The agreement was to pay $300 a month. The IRS involuntarily
withheld subsequent annual tax refunds and applied them to the balance. He testified that
he started the installment agreement sometime in 2015 and made the payments until he
stopped in late 2017 when he lost his job. He said he contacted the IRS, but did not make
another payment until March 2018. In October 2018, he entered into a new installment
agreement with the IRS to pay $150 a month until December 2019, when the amount will

increase  to  $375.  He  makes  an  automatic  monthly  payment.  He  provided  proof  of  his
most recent payment.4 It is being resolved.
In November 2016, Applicant fell behind on his mortgage payments because he
was  maintaining  two  households  (SOR  ¶1.b-$10,725).  He  contacted  the  mortgage
company  and  entered  a  loan  modification  agreement  in  May  2017.  He  made  timely
payments  on  the  new  mortgage  agreement  until  he  lost  his  job  in  August  2017.  He
contacted  his  mortgage  company  again  and  a  new  loan  modification  was  approved  in
February 2018. He made a lump-sum payment of $8,038 in October 2018 to catch up,
and  has  been  making  the  new  payments.  He  provided  proof  of  his  November  2018
payment. He testified he obtained the lump-sum amount from a loan that he is repaying.
He provided proof that he is paying the loan. Applicant and his wife have decided to sell
the house and are working with a realtor to put it on the market. They intend to downsize
and purchase a more affordable house. The mortgage in SOR ¶ 1.b ($10,725) is being
resolved. 5
The credit-card debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($14,802) was used by Applicant when he was
separated from his wife to help him pay expenses. He said he made some payments to
the collection company. He provided a copy of a recent payment plan with the collection
company,  which  required  he  pay  $2,000  in  November  2018  and  monthly  payments
thereafter of $500 a month. He provided proof of his $2,000 payment.6 The debt is being
resolved.
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($2,802) became past due when Applicant lost his job. He
has  a  payment  plan  with  the  creditor  that  agrees  to  monthly  automatic  withdrawals  of
$231.  He  provided  documented  proof  of  the  agreement  with  the  creditor  and  his
November payment.7 The debt is being resolved.
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($1,159) is a debt that became delinquent when Applicant
lost his job. He provided documented proof that he is making payments to resolve the
debt. He testified that he believed the remaining balance owes is about $700.8 This debt
is being resolved.
Applicant was unaware he owed the medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.f ($89). He paid the
debt in April 2018. He provided documented proof.9 This debt is resolved.

Applicant provided a detailed copy of a budget he has been using for a couple of
months. It includes all of his payment plans and debts. He testified that he and his family
have  significantly  cut  their  expenses. They  do  not  go  out  to eat.  He  does not take his
grandchildren  out  for  entertainment  because  he  cannot  afford  it.  In  his  post-hearing
submission, he stated that his son and daughter are now paying the house’s utility bills to
help with the expenses.10
