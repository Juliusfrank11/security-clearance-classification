Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 32 years old. He began college in 2006 and graduated in May 2012
having earned a bachelor’s degree. He married in 2013. He has no children. Applicant
has been employed by a federal contractor since October 2016.
The SOR alleged that Applicant has approximately $156,322 in delinquent student
loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.g).  He  stated  in  his  October  2016  security  clearance
application (SCA) the following:
I attended a private university. With little financial literacy, I took out private
and  government  loans  that  I  couldn’t  hope  to  pay.  Since  leaving  college,
I’ve been unemployed and haven’t been able to secure a job that paid more
than $13.25 an hour. The defaulted loans are a consequence of my inability
to secure adequate wages given my college education and my inconsistent
employment history. I wish the story was different but those are the facts.1
* * *
My Federal Student Loans tally to approximately $51,988. My private loans
are approximately $177,683.2
Regarding the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.h (credit card debt-$1,189), 1.k (medical debt-
$119), 1.l (medical debt-$63), and 1.j (cell phone debt-$198), Appellant stated in his SCA
the following:
The credit card was a simple issue of non-repayment. It’s been closed and
written off. The other three collection issues are still pending and total $380
dollars. One is a cancellation fee, the other is a fee for an urgent care trip
that I thought was resolved a long time ago and the last one is a fee that
was supposed to be paid by my previous employer when I was forced to
visit the ER within the hospital I was working at.
1 Item 3.
2 Item 3.
* * *
The [credit card] charge has been written off and charged off as a bad debt.
The other three are still open in collections.3
* * *
The open collection accounts are simple to resolve. $380 dollars will take
care of that. The [credit card debt] issue has been resolved.4
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  November  2017.  He
was confronted with the delinquent student loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e. He
told the investigator these were private student loans, and he cannot afford to pay them
because he does not earn enough income. The creditor offered to settle the debt for a
lump sum amount of $63,000, but Applicant could not afford it. He has no plans to resolve
these loans because he cannot afford to make the monthly payments required.5
Applicant  was  not  sure  if the  student  loans alleged  in  SOR ¶¶ 1.f and  1.g  were
private student loans or government loans. He stated his government student loans were
in a rehabilitation program, and he did not know if the loans in SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g were
part of that program. He said he could not pay these loans because he does not earn
enough income.6
Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  he  intended  to  pay  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.l  by
December 2017.He said that he would contact the creditor for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k in
December 2017, to discuss it. He said he contacted the creditor for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.j
and would call the creditor again in December 2017, to try and resolve it. Regarding the
credit  card  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.h,  he  did  not  plan  on  contacting  the  creditor  to  resolve  it
because he cannot pay this debt and his federal student loans at the same time. Applicant
did not provide any documents or other information regarding his efforts to resolve these
smaller debts.7
The  investigator  confronted  Applicant  with  the  charged  off  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.m
($2,200). This was a loan he used to purchase his wife’s engagement ring. He indicated
that because he had inconsistent employment, he was unable to pay this loan. Due to his
current  plan  to pay  his  federal  loans, he  does  not have  sufficient funds to  resolve  this
debt.8

4 Item 3.
5 Item 4.
6 Item 4.
7 Item 4.
8 Item 4.
Applicant was employed from October 2015 to September 2016 before starting his
current job. He disclosed that he worked as a camp counselor during the summers (June
through  August)  while  in  college  from  2009  to  2012,  and  then  continued  during  the
summers  through  2016.  He  lists  other  employment  from  September  2014  to  February
2015 (he left this job because it was a temporary job for six months); October 2013 to
May 2014 (he left this job to work at summer camp); November 2012 to December 2012
(he quit this job because it did not suit him).9
Applicant disclosed to the investigator that he and his wife took a five-day cruise
in August 2017 to the Bahamas. He and his wife also took a five-day cruise to Jamaica
and Cayman Islands in May 2014.10
Applicant’s admissions and credit reports from January 2017 and February 2018
corroborate all of the debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant did not provide any information
about his and his wife’s current income; documents to substantiate he is paying his federal
student loans; a budget; or proof that he resolved the smaller debts.11
