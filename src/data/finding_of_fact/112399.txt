Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for
his current employer since September 2017. Before her current position, she worked for
a  private  sector  employer  from  May  1999  to  July  2017,  when  she  was  fired  for
employee misconduct.1
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  was  involuntarily  terminated  from  her  hospital
position  in  July  2017  for  committing  a  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability
Act (HIPPA) violation. It further alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose her
termination when she completed a Declaration for Federal Employment (Form 306) on
October 17, 2017.
Applicant’s  employer  determined  she  committed  a  HIPPA  violation  while
employed as a nurse with the hospital. She had texted confidential patient information to
a family member. As a result, she was terminated by her employer on July 31, 2017. In
her answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegation.2
Applicant submitted a Form 306 in October 2017 for a position she was seeking.
She answered “No” to question 12, which asked: “During the last five years, have you
been  fired  from  any  job  for  any  reason?”  In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she
admitted  answering  the  question  in  the  negative.  She  explained  that  she  was  so
focused on answering the question about her student loans that she did not pay enough
attention to this question. I find this explanation implausible.3
