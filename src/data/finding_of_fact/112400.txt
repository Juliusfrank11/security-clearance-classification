Under  Guideline  F,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant  owed  $20,371  for  ten
delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a – 1.j). In response, Applicant denied SOR 1.c and
1.g  –  1.i,  and  admitted  the  remaining  allegations.  He  also  provided  explanations  and
supporting  documents.  (Answer)  In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by  Applicant’s
admissions, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 59 years old and works as a laborer for a federal contractor, where he
has been employed since May 2015. He requires a security clearance for access to the
facilities to which he is assigned for work. Applicant and his wife were married in April
2017  after  living  together  since  July  2010.  Applicant  was  previously  married  between
September 1992 and April 1997, and between April 2004 and June 2010. He has one
child,  now  an  adult,  from  his  first  marriage.  Applicant  paid  monthly  child  support  as
required between his divorce in 1997 and September 2015, when his support obligations
ended. (Answer; GX 1; AX E; AX K; Tr. 61 – 62)
1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.
2 At the time they issued the SOR, DOD adjudicators applied the adjudicative guidelines implemented by
the  Department  of  Defense  on  September  1,  2006.  On  December  10,  2016,  the  Director  of  National
Intelligence issued a new version of the adjudicative guidelines, to be effective for all adjudications on or
after June 8, 2017. My decision in this case would have been the same under either version.

Applicant attended a technical training institute between 2009 and 2013, receiving
certification as a help desk professional. He also attended one month training courses in
2006, 2007, and 2014. He financed his 2009 – 2013 studies through student loans that
are currently in forbearance. Applicant has been employed in a variety of jobs since at
least 2006. He was unemployed at the end of his employers’ contracts between May 2013
and November 2014; and in April and May 2015. All of the alleged debts in the SOR are
documented in two credit reports obtained during his background investigation. (GX 1 –
3; AX D)
The debt at SOR 1.a is for unpaid rent placed in collection and enforced by a civil
judgment entered against Applicant in July 2012. Available information shows Applicant
made several payments on this debt in 2012 and 2013. More recently, Applicant has been
trying  to  negotiate  a  settlement  or  repayment  plan  for  the  remaining  balance  due.
(Answer; GX 2; GX 3; AX J; Tr. 31 – 36)
The debt alleged at SOR 1.b is for unpaid debt, also in 2012. Applicant submitted
information showing this debt has been paid. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; AX G; AX M; Tr. 36
– 38)
Applicant  disputes  the  debt  at  SOR  1.c,  which  is  for  a  delinquent  cell  phone
account. He submitted information that shows the creditor has no information attributing
this  debt  to  Applicant.  The  debt  is  not  listed  in  the  credit  report  Applicant  submitted.
(Answer; GX 2; GX 3; AX F; AX Q; Tr. 39 – 42)
The debt at SOR 1.d is for a delinquent utility account. Applicant has been making
$100 payments on that debt each month since April 2018. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; AX A;
AX P; Tr. 39 – 43)
The  medical  debts  at  SOR  1.e,  1.g,  and  1.j  are  being  addressed  as  one
consolidated  debt.  Applicant  has  made  monthly  $100  payments  since  April  2018.
(Answer; GX 2; GX 3; AX B; AX C; AX L; Tr. 43 – 44, 49, 50 – 52)
The  debt  at SOR  1.f  is  for  the  balance  remaining  after  resale of a  car  that  was
repossessed in 2011. Applicant has not resolved this debt. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; AX N;
44 – 47, 65 – 66)
Available information shows that the debts at SOR 1.h and 1.i are for the same
delinquent  cable  television  account.  Applicant  presented  information  showing  the  debt
has been paid. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; AX O; Tr. 50)
Appellant attributes his unpaid debts to expenses arising from his second divorce
in 2010. Thereafter, he endured periods of unemployment between 2013 and 2015 that
interrupted his efforts to resolve his debts and further exacerbated his financial problems.
He was unaware of several of the debts alleged in the SOR until he was interviewed by
a government investigator in December 2017. His efforts to pay his debts did not begin in
earnest  until  April  2018  because  he  did  not  have  enough  money  saved  up  to  make
payments. The largest of his unresolved debts is for the remainder after resale of a car
that was repossessed in 2011, around the time of his second divorce. Applicant believed
at the time that he had no further obligation, but he has recently attempted to correspond
with  that  creditor  (SOR  1.f)  to  make  repayment  arrangements.  In  addition  to  the  debt
resolution  progress  reflected  in  his  response  to  the  SOR  and  in  his  hearing  exhibits,
Applicant  has  enlisted  the  services  of  a  credit  counseling  service  through  which  he
intends to clear up inaccuracies in his credit history and to negotiate repayments with his
remaining creditors. (Answer; AX N; AX Q; Tr. 26 – 27, 44 – 47, 53 – 55, 65 – 66)
Applicant and his third wife manage their finances together. Because her income
is substantially more than his, he provides his income to her to cover the expenses she
does not pay. Credit reports show that Applicant has not incurred any new debts since
2016, and Applicant files and pays his federal and state income taxes as required. (GX
2; GX 3; Tr. 28 – 30, 58 – 76)
Applicant was candid and straightforward in his testimony. He appeared earnest
in his desire to continue resolving his remaining debts and improve his finances. Applicant
has a good reputation at work for reliability, hard work, and honesty. (AX H; AX I)
