Under Guideline F, the Government alleged Applicant owed the IRS $22,167 for
unpaid taxes in the 2012 tax year (SOR 1.a), and $28,175 for unpaid taxes in the 2013
tax year (SOR 1.b), with the $50,342 total debt being preserved through a single tax lien
entered against Applicant in September 2016. It was further alleged that Applicant owed
$1,605 for an unpaid medical account (SOR 1.c). In response, Applicant admitted all three
allegations,  and  he  provided  explanations  and  supporting  documents.  (Answer)  In
addition to the facts established by Applicant’s admissions, I make the following additional
findings of fact.
As  to  SOR  1.c,  Applicant  disputed  this  debt  during  his  November  14,  2017
personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  with  a  government  investigator.  At  hearing,  Applicant
presented information that shows this debt has been satisfied. SOR 1.c is resolved for
Applicant. (Answer; GX 2; AX A; Tr. 11 – 12)
Applicant is 49 years old and works as an instructor for a federal contractor, where
he has been employed since September 2015. Applicant served in the U.S. Army from
January  1992  until  July  1995,  when  he  received  an  honorable  discharge  for  medical
reasons. Applicant has held a security clearance since early 1992. He and his wife have
been married since September 2013 and have one child together. Applicant was married
twice previously and has one adult child from his first marriage. (GX 1)
From August 2005 until September 2015, Applicant worked for two different federal
contractors  providing  security  for  overseas  diplomatic  personnel.  During  that  time,  he
lived and worked overseas on a nearly permanent basis. Most years during that period,
Applicant qualified for exemption from federal income tax of the first $97,000 of his annual
income. Each year he used a certified public accountant (CPA) to prepare and file his
returns and to assist him in resolving any discrepancies that might arise with regard to his

federal and  state  income  taxes.  Applicant has  always  timely  complied  with  his  income
reporting and payment obligations. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 34 – 35, 38, 40 – 41)
In 2014, the IRS audited Applicant’s taxes for the 2012 and 2013 tax years. Based
on  that  audit,  the  IRS  retroactively  disallowed  large  portions  of  Applicant’s  claimed
overseas income tax exemptions and determined that he owed the taxes alleged in SOR
1.a and 1.b. Applicant contacted his CPA and they notified the IRS of their intent to appeal
the audit findings in federal tax court. After being given a court date, a deadline was set
for submitting information in support of Applicant’s appeal. At the time the court date and
filing  deadlines  were  established,  Applicant  had  been  in  the  United  States  on  medical
leave for about two months. However, the notice of his court date and the filing deadline
were sent to his overseas address. By the time Applicant became aware of the deadline,
he was unable to timely submit the necessary information. As a result, his appeal was
denied.  Subsequently,  the  IRS  perfected  a  single  lien  of  $50,342  against  Applicant  to
preserve  the  IRS’  claim  against  him.  The  lien  was  obtained  in  September  2016,  but
Applicant did not become aware of it until January 2017. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 26 –
28, 30 – 33, 45 – 46)
Applicant’s finances are otherwise sound. Available information shows that he is
currently  carrying  more  credit  card  debt  than  he  would  prefer,  he  attributes  those
expenditures  to  unexpected  repairs  needed  on  a  home  he  and  his  wife  recently
purchased. Aside from the liens documented in his credit report, all of his debts are in
good standing. Applicant averred that the only reason the IRS obtained these liens is that
he  missed  his  filing  deadline  through  no  fault  of  his  own.  He  is  confident  they  will  be
resolved in his favor, but cannot say when that will happen. In response to the IRS’ action,
Applicant and his CPA have been working to resolve Applicant’s tax debts through the
Taxpayer  Advocate  Service  (TAS)  within  the  IRS.  One  of  the  TAS  representatives
advised Applicant on March 8, 2018, that Applicant’s case had an estimated resolution
date of May 22, 2018. On October 4, 2018, Applicant’s case was still pending and another
TAS representative advised that additional time would be needed to resolve the case and
that  Applicant  would  be  notified  of  the  status  of  his  case  by  November  1,  2018.  No
additional information has been forthcoming from TAS. (Answer; AX B; Tr. 35 – 37, 51 –
52)
Applicant believes that the IRS does not plan to levy any of his pay or assets to
enforce the liens against him. In the event he does not prevail in having the liens released
and  the  debts  extinguished,  Applicant  will  pursue  one  of  two  paths  to  resolve  any
remaining debt. He might negotiate a settlement for a lesser amount he could pay off in
monthly installments. Alternatively, in most of the years he worked overseas, he received
per diem benefits that were not taxable. Nonetheless, he declared that money as income
out of a sense of obligation. In order to reduce his tax obligations for 2012 and 2013, his
CPA has suggested that he could refile those returns without the previously declared per
diem so as to reduce his overall tax for those years. Theoretically, this would reduce his
tax  debts  that  would  be  subject  to  the  results  of  the  2014  audit.  Regardless  of  which
resolution he might pursue, available information shows Applicant has sufficient income
and  monthly  net  cash  flow  to  resolve  the  liens,  should  a  final  determination  be  made
against him. (Answer; GX 2; Tr. 29 – 30, 39 – 40, 46 – 48)
Applicant excelled in his work overseas between 2005 and 2015. He now works in
the  United  States  and  has  continued  his  outstanding  performance.  He  returned  from
overseas in September 2015 after being injured, and he does not plan on returning to
overseas assignments with his current employer. (Answer; Tr. 33 – 35, 44)
