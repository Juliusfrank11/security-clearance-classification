Applicant is a 41-year-old technician, employed full time by a defense contractor
since September 2016, and part time as a student intern from August 2015 to September
2016. He was unemployed from 2008 to 2015. He received a bachelor’s degree in 2016.
He married in 1998 and divorced in 2000; again in 2004 and divorced in 2012; and finally
remarried in 2017. He has four children and two stepchildren. He served on active duty
in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  from  1995  to  1999  and  from  2000  to  2005.  He  was  honorably
discharged both times.  Applicant held a security clearance while in the military.
The SOR alleges Applicant is delinquent on child support, education loans, and a
medical account totaling approximately $64,000. The SOR allegations are supported by
substantial evidence. Applicant admitted the SOR allegations.
Applicant’s financial problems began when his second spouse divorced him. He
was  a  full-time  student  and  was  not  working.  From  2012  to  2016,  Applicant  made  no
payments for child support. He restarted payments in 2017 via a garnishment from his
paycheck. He believes he still owes about $39,000. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b)
Applicant owes about $17,000 plus interest in unpaid student loans. He believes
they are now in default. Applicant has insufficient income to pay his student loans. He has
not contacted the government creditor to arrange a repayment plan. (SOR ¶¶ 1.c to 1.e.)
Applicant  owes  approximately  $782  on  a  medical  bill  incurred  while  he  was  a
student.  He  paid  about  half  of  the  debt  before  stopping  payments  in  2014  because  of
insufficient income. (SOR ¶ 1.e)
Applicant admitted that he lives paycheck to paycheck, and has no net remainder
after  paying  monthly  expenses.  He  and  his  spouse  owe  on  credit  cards,  rental
agreements,  and  vehicle  loans,  one  of  which  is  a  title  loan.  He  describes  himself  as
incredibly  lazy  when  it  comes  to  financial  matters and  paying  bills.  He  has  not  sought
financial counseling.
Law and Policies
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484  U.S.  518, 528  (1988). As  Commander in  Chief,  the President  has  the  authority  to
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is  clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An
administrative  judge  must  consider  a  person’s  stability,  trustworthiness,  reliability,
discretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG ¶ 1(b).
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the
possible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant
has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the  President  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  have
established for issuing a clearance.
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the
personal or professional history  of  the applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant from
being  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information.  The  Government  has  the  burden  of
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. “Substantial
evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less  than a preponderance.” See v. Washington
Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a
nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the  criteria  listed
therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3
(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015).
Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG ¶ 1(d).
