Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except ¶ 1.b, which he believed was
a duplicate with ¶ 1.c. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 59 years old. He holds an associate’s degree. He served in the Army
and was honorably discharged. He married in 1984 and has four children, ages 33, 31,
25,  and  22.  He  has  worked  for  his  present  employer,  a  federal  contractor,  since  April
2016.1
Applicant disclosed on his August 2016 security clearance application (SCA) that
he was unemployed December 2015 to January 2016; September 2013 to January 2014;
and July 2009 to November 2009. He explained in his answer to the SOR that he worked
as  a  independent  contractor  and  could  not  control  the  duration  of  the  contracts,
unexpected  cancelations,  and  whether  the  contract  was  renewed.  When  he  was  not
working on a contract, it impacted his finances. He also explained that he earned more
money when he worked as a independent contractor. He has decided to work in a job
where he receives a regular salary, where he earns less money than when he worked
independently, but he receives a consistent salary with benefits.2
Applicant’s  admissions  and  credit  reports  from  September  2016  and  February
2018, corroborate the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR.3
Applicant stated in his SOR answer and provided documents to show that in May
2018,  he  sought  financial  assistance  with  a  debt  solution  company.  The  company
provided him a proposed plan to pay his delinquent debs. Not all of the SOR debts were
included in the plan. There is no evidence that Applicant has implemented the plan and
made any monthly payments towards resolution of the debts that are alleged in the SOR.4
Applicant  stated  in  his  answer  that  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  ($15,464)  is  for  a
repossessed vehicle. He purchased the vehicle in March 2013, and he fell behind on his
monthly payments in about September 2013, because he was in between contracts and

unemployed. He attempted to catch up payments for the two delinquent months, but the
creditor  refused  to  accept  his  payments  and  repossessed  the  vehicle.  Apparently,
Applicant had an unpleasant encounter with the creditor. In his FORM response, he said
he contacted the creditor and was told the account was past the time to collect, and he
should leave it alone. It is unknown what this advice means, other than to wait until the
statute  of  limitation  runs.  In  his  FORM  response,  he  said  that  he  received  a  letter
indicating  there  was  a  lawsuit  against  this  creditor  for  devious  practices.  No  other
information or documents were provided.5 This debt is not resolved.
Applicant  indicated  that  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  ($1,364)  is  a  duplicate  of  ¶  1.c
($974). In the Government’s FORM, it advised Applicant that the two allegations were not
the  same  debt  and  the  credit  reports  reflect  they  are  different  accounts.  Applicant
indicated he was working with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.c. He did not provide documentation
that he has a payment plan, has resolved either of these debts, or substantiated the debts
are duplicates. These debts are not resolved.6
Applicant had a dispute with the merchant in SOR ¶ 1.d ($242). He felt he was
treated badly when he tried to return merchandise. The debt was charged off in December
2011.  He  stated  that  when  he  contacted  the  creditor  that  holds  the  account,  he  was
advised the account is past the statute of limitation. The debt is unresolved.7
Applicant  was  told  that  the  debt  in SOR ¶  1.e  ($2,140),  which  was  a  consumer
account,  is  past  the  statute  of  limitations,  and  he  was  advised  to  leave  it  alone.  It  is
unresolved.8
Applicant’s  response  to  SOR  ¶  1.f  ($1,230)  does  not  articulate  whether  he  has
resolved the account. He wrote “settlement $1,230,” but failed to provide information that
shows he has paid the debt or reached a settlement agreement that he has paid. It is
unresolved.9
Applicant indicated that with the help of his credit counselor, he is still working to
resolve the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g ($384), a cell phone account. He did not provide any other
information or documentary evidence. It is unresolved.10

Applicant stated in his answer to the SOR that he paid the medical debt in SOR ¶
1.h ($160) that was in collection. He did not provide documentary evidence to show it is
paid. It is unresolved.11
Applicant said that he attempted to speak to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.i ($57). He
said the creditor told him it did not have his social security number showing he had a debt.
Applicant did not provide documentary evidence to show he has disputed the debt. It is
not resolved.12
In Applicant’s FORM response he provided a document to show he paid a medical
collection  account  in  January  2019.  It  appears  this  debt  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.
Applicant  stated  that  he  is  not  irresponsible  or  in  financial  “bad  shape.”  He  provided
financial documents to  corroborate his  statement.  He  said and  the  documents  support
that  as  of  January  2019,  he  had  approximately  $18,657  in  one  of  his  bank  accounts;
$5,723  in  another  account;  approximately  $30,000  in  a  401k  pension  plan;  and  about
$32,290 in stock options that will  vest in about a year. Applicant further stated that he
owns a home and has a second investment home.13
