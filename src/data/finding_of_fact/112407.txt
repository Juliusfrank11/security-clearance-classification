In his Answer to the SOR,1 Applicant admitted, with comments, nearly all of the
factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.b. through
1.h., and 1.j.). Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings
of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a network analyst with his current employer since May 2017. He completed his high
school education through the General Educational Development (GED) Program in 1978,
and  he  graduated  from  high  school  in  1983.  At  the  time  of  the  hearing,  he  was  three
credits  shy  of  completing  the  requirements  for  an  Associate’s  degree.  He  has  never
served  in  the  U.S.  military.  He  has  never  held  a  security  clearance,  but  has  been
occupying a position of public trust since 2017. Applicant was married in 2009. He has
four children, born in 1981, 1984, 1987, and 1989, as well as two stepchildren, born in
1994, and 1995.
1 Although Applicant’s Answer to the SOR was submitted  on April 4, 2018, the DOD CAF noted
that he had failed to respond to SOR ¶ 1.j. After being reminded by the DOD CAF that he had initially failed
to address the allegation, on April 11, 2018, Applicant admitted the allegation by e-mail.
Financial Considerations2
With the exception of one reported delinquent account from 2011, there apparently
was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until 2016 when a series of factors started
taking their cumulative toll on his ability to remain current on his various accounts. He had
been unemployed or underemployed on several occasions before 2016: from May 2009
until  September  2009;  from  December 2013  until  February  2014;  and  from  April  2015
until November 2015. It was Applicant’s initial intention to earn an Associate’s degree,
and to do so, he accepted low paying and less demanding positions to increase his skills
through  on-the-job  training.  However, in  April  2016,  Applicant  was terminated from  his
position  because  of  unhappiness  over  his  performance  progression.  He  remained
unemployed  or  underemployed  until  May  2017.  During  that  most  recent  period,
Applicant’s savings were depleted, and accounts became delinquent. His residence went
into  a  foreclosure  status,  a  tax  lien  was  filed,  and  various  accounts  were  placed  for
collection.  Some  accounts  were  charged  off.  Another  factor  exacerbating  Applicant’s
finances were his repeated relocations from state to state, either to follow his wife and
her employment activities, or to accept temporary employment opportunities.3
Applicant  sought  guidance  from  several  credit  counselors;4  completed  a  credit
counseling course;5 contacted various creditors in an effort to settle accounts or enter into
reasonable  repayment  plans;  engaged  the  professional  services  of  both  a  credit
consolidation company and a debt resolution company;6 and, starting in July 2017 – eight
months before the SOR was issued – he started setting aside $756 per month intended
for repayments to creditors.7 In April 2018, he was scheduled to commence a financial
counseling course with a nationally renowned financial expert.8
The SOR identified 12 purportedly delinquent accounts that had been placed for
collection or charged off, including one tax lien and one house in a foreclosure status, as
generally  reflected  by  Applicant’s  August  2017  or  January  2018  credit  reports.  Those
debts total approximately $71,303. The current status of those accounts is as follows:

(SOR ¶ 1.a.): This is a conventional home mortgage with a high credit of $100,000
and an unpaid balance of $68,868, of which $18,534 was past-due, which was placed for
collection  and  entered  into  a  foreclosure  status.9  Because  of  a  new  job,  Applicant’s
financial situation had to be recertified, but the process took more time than anticipated,
and new loan modification documents had to be prepared.  Applicant continued making
monthly payments of $428.86 for five months. The foreclosure action was terminated in
May 2018, and as of June 1, 2018, the modified mortgage was established in the amount
of $67,375.85, with monthly payments of $313.81, plus escrow, totaling $537.90.10 The
past-due amount has been added into the amount of the mortgage, and the mortgage is
current. The account has been resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): This is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $24,275,
and  a  past-due  balance  of  $8,606,  that  was  placed  for  collection  and  charged  off.11
Through  his  debt  resolution  company,  Applicant  reached  out  to  the  creditor  and  after
approximately  one  year,  negotiations  went  nowhere.  In  his  e-QIP,  he  stated  that  the
creditor had agreed to a settlement of $12,678, and unspecified monthly payments would
be made through his debt resolution company.12 That assertion was not accurate, for the
creditor  refused  to  accept  any  reduced  payments. In  June 2018,  working  with  another
credit counseling organization, Applicant was referred to another lender, with whom the
creditor frequently worked, and he was approved for a $24,275 loan, to be repaid under
a  repayment  plan  under  which  he  would  make  previously  authorized  $566  monthly
payments for 35 months, starting in August 2018.13 At some point by the end of 2018, it
was  anticipated  that  the  original  creditor  would  be  paid  in  full  by  the  new  loan,  and
Applicant would merely be responsible for the continuing reduced monthly payments to
the new lender.14 The account has been resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): This is a bank-issued credit-card account with an unpaid and past-
due  balance  of  $10,091  that  was  placed  for  collection  and  charged  off.15  Applicant
reached  out  to  the  collection  agent  in  June  2017  –  nine  months  before  the  SOR  was
issued – and agreed to a repayment plan under which he agreed to make preauthorized
bi-monthly  $64  payments,  starting  in  June  2017.  He  made  those  payments,  totaling
$1,088,  until  the  account  was  transferred  to  a  new  collection  agent  in  early  2018.16  A
revised  repayment plan  was  accepted  by  the  new  collection agent  in  mid-2018,  under

which  Applicant  agreed  to  preauthorized  automatic  $110  monthly  payments  until
December 2018. At that point, the collection agent was anticipated to offer a discount of
30 percent for a 15-month payoff plan.17 The account is in the process of being resolved.
(SOR  ¶¶  1.d.  and  1.e.):  These  are  two  bank-issued  credit-card  accounts  with
unpaid balances of $5,948 and $3,997 that were placed for collection and charged off.18
Applicant’s debt resolution company and the collection agent agreed to repayment plans
for both accounts, and commencing in April 2018, monthly payments have been made to
the larger of the two accounts: $162 for the first month, and $146 each successive month;
and to the smaller account: $100 each month.19 Both accounts are in the process of being
resolved.
(SOR  ¶  1.f.):  This  is  a  bank-issued  charge  account  with  an  unpaid  balance  of
$3,230 that was placed for collection.20 Applicant reached out to the collection agent in
July 2018, a repayment plan was proposed under which he agreed to make monthly $44
payments.  While  there  is  a  schedule  of  future  payments,  Applicant  only  furnished
documentation to confirm that the initial payment had been made.21 Applicant stated that
it is his intention to continue making the monthly payments, and after other debts are paid
off,  he  would  increase  these  monthly  payments.22  Nevertheless,  the  account  is  in  the
process of being resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.g.): This is an unspecified type of account with an unpaid and past-due
balance of $1,615 that was placed for collection and charged off.23 Applicant reached out
to  the  debt  purchaser  and  agreed  to  a  repayment  plan  under  which  he  authorized
automatic  monthly  withdrawals  from  his  account  in  the  amount  of  $50.  He  submitted
documentation of several routine past monthly payments.24 Applicant also contended that
the collection agent had agreed to settle the account for $795, he failed to submit any

manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd.

documentation  to  support  his  contention.  He  expects  the  account  to  be  paid  in  full  by
January 2019.25 The account is in the process of being resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.h.): This is an unspecified type of bank account with an unpaid balance
of $1,066 that was placed for collection.26 Applicant and the collection agent agreed to a
repayment plan under which, commencing in July 2018, monthly $45 payments would be
made. He submitted documentation reflecting only one such payment.27 On August 16,
2018, the collection agent offered to settle the account for one lump-sum payment of $465
to be made by August 28, 2018, but Applicant was apparently unable to make such a
payment. Nevertheless, the account is in the process of being resolved.28
(SOR  ¶  1.i.):  This  is  a  bank-issued  charge  account  with  an  unpaid  balance  of
$1,015  that  was  placed  for  collection  and  sold  to  a  debt  purchaser.29  Applicant’s  debt
resolution company and the debt purchaser agreed to a $601 settlement, followed by a
repayment plan in September 2017  – six months before the SOR was issued – and in
March 2018, a final payment was made under that plan. The current balance is zero.30
The account has been resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.j.): This is a state tax lien in the amount of $1,205 that was filed in 2016,
and placed for collection.31 Applicant claimed that he resided in the state for six months
and after he moved, but he never received any notice of delinquent taxes. The unpaid tax
of  $137  was  increased  because  of fees.  After several unsuccessful efforts  to  set  up a
repayment plan with the collection agent, an agreement was finally established in July
2018,  under  which  Applicant  agreed  to  make  monthly  $100  payments.32  Applicant
furnished  documentation  to  confirm  that  a  few  payments  had  been  made.33  Because
there was an issue regarding the accuracy of the amount owed the state because of a
tax-preparer  error,  the  state  is  reviewing  the  issue.34  Nevertheless,  the  lien  is  in  the
process of being resolved.

(SOR ¶ 1.k.): This is a cellular telephone account with an unpaid balance of $175
that was placed for collection.35 Applicant contends that the original balance was $120,
and that he had been making unspecified payments for an unspecified period. He also
claimed that the collection agent offered to settle the account for $80 in two separate $40
payments. Those payments were made on April 20, 2018 and May 18, 2018.36 However,
it  appears  that  the  collection  agent  representative  was  not  legitimate,  and  a  fraud
investigation was opened. Applicant contended that he paid the creditor $87, and that a
letter would be furnished to him to indicate the account was paid in full.37 Applicant did
not  submit  documentation  to  support  his  contention  that  the  payment  was  made.
Nevertheless, the account is the process of being resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.l.): This is a medical account with an unpaid balance of $152 that was
placed  for  collection.38  Applicant  contended  that  the  account  was  listed  in  error for  he
actually  paid  for  his  medical  services  directly  to  the  provider  in  2011.  The  creditor
confirmed the error.39 The account has been resolved.
Other than the accounts alleged in the SOR, Applicant is not aware of any other
delinquent  accounts.  During  the  hearing,  Applicant  submitted  a  Personal  Financial
Statement  to  reflect  his  monthly  net  income  ($5,300);  monthly  expenses  ($3,387),
including those made to his debt resolution company, described above; and a monthly
remainder ($1,913) available for discretionary saving or spending.40 One month after the
hearing, he submitted an updated Personal Financial Statement to reflect his monthly net
income  ($5,266),  not  including  any  income  by  his  wife;  monthly  expenses  ($4,681),
including  those  made  to  his  debt  resolution  company,  described  above,  and  other
payments  made  directly  to  his  creditors; and  a  monthly  remainder ($585) available  for
discretionary saving or spending.41
