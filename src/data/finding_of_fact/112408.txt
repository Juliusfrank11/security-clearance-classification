Under  Guideline  F,  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  owed  $12,669  for
unpaid federal taxes from tax years 2009, and 2011 – 2013. (SOR 1.a) It was also alleged
that Applicant did not timely file, as required, her federal income tax returns for tax years
2009 through 2016 (SOR 1.b); and that she failed to pay her state income taxes for the
2008, 2009, and 2012 tax years, with the 2008 and 2009 tax debts having been satisfied
through levy on her employment wages (SOR 1.c). The SOR also alleged that Applicant
owed $15,219 for 11 delinquent medical bills (SOR 1.d – 1.m, 1.o); and that she owed an
unspecified balance due on a commercial credit card account (SOR 1.n).
In  response  to  the  SOR  (Answer),  Applicant  admitted,  with  explanations  and
supporting  documents,  all  but  one  (SOR  1.o)  of  the  allegations.  With  her  Answer,
Applicant provided copies of her 2015 and 2016 federal income tax returns. They were
not signed or dated. (Tr. 14)
In addition to the facts established by Applicant’s admissions, I make the following
findings  of  fact.  Applicant  is  49  years  old  and  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  in  a
position  that  requires  eligibility  for  a  position  of  trust.  Applicant  works  as  a  claims
processor for a company that supports management of the health care system used by
members  of  the  military,  and  her  duties  include  safeguarding  personally  identifiable
information (PII) associated with the health care system’s constituents. She has worked
for  her  current  employer  since  October  1996,  and  she  has  held  a  public  trust  position
since at least 2004. (GX 1; Tr. 37 – 38)
The allegations regarding Applicant’s failure to timely file her federal income tax
returns  between  2009  and  2016  are  based  on  her  disclosures  in  response  to  tax  and
finance  questions  in  her  e-QIP.  At  or  near  the  time  of  her  September  2017  subject
interview  by  a  government  investigator, Applicant  provided  information  that  shows  she
timely filed her 2014 return and owed no additional taxes. At her hearing, she presented
information that shows her 2013 return was timely filed, but it was rejected due to errors
by  the  person  who  prepared  the  return.  That  year,  Applicant  received  an  erroneous
$6,000 refund that she had to repay. Applicant’s information at hearing showed that the
total federal income tax debt alleged has been reduced to $2,568, and that her refunds,
most recently for tax year 2016, have been applied to the debts for tax years 2009, 2011,
and  2012.  Her  remaining  tax  debt  is  for  2012  alone.  This  information  implies  that
Applicant’s returns for those years have, as she has claimed, been filed. (Answer; GX 1;
GX 2; AX A; Tr. 27 – 28, 30 – 34)
In her e-QIP, Applicant also disclosed her state income debts for the 2008, 2009,
and 2012 tax years. Available information further shows that only her 2012 debt remains
unresolved.  That  debt  is  being  enforced  through  a  February  2017  tax  lien  for  $1,233.
(Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 5; Tr. 34, 48 – 50)
Applicant has a history of income tax problems. A 2003 signed, sworn statement
from a previous subject interview showed she had incurred numerous delinquent or past-
due  debts,  including  federal  and  state  income  tax  debts  totaling  about  $4,650.  She
averred  therein  that  her  financial  problems  stemmed  from  circumstances  beyond  her
control, such as surgery and a car accident. As to her taxes, most often, Applicant testified
that she failed to timely file her income tax returns, usually because she knew she could
not  afford  to  pay  any  additional  taxes.  Applicant’s  taxes  due  after  her  returns  usually
resulted from the fact that she claimed nine exemptions from withholding. This practice
results in higher paychecks, but also requires payment of those taxes with her returns.
Applicant still claims nine exemptions from withholding. (GX 6; Tr. 44 – 50, 65 – 67)
In her e-QIP, Applicant disclosed numerous unpaid medical bills. For the most part,
her medical debts (SOR 1.d – 1.m, 1.o total $15,219) are for services provided to her and
her  family  over  the  past  several  years.  The  largest  of  her  medical  debts  (SOR  1.d  for
$9,099)  is  for  Applicant’s  hospitalization  for  cardiac  care.  Applicant  has  always  had
employer-provided medical insurance, albeit, with high deductibles. SOR 1.d aside, she
has not explained why she did not pay her other more moderate bills. Applicant also has
not taken any discernable action to pay or otherwise resolve any of her medical debts.
(Answer; GX 1; GX 4; GX 5; Tr. 34, 50 – 51, 68 – 70)
Applicant and her husband  have been married since June 2005, and they have
two children (ages 11 and 13). Applicant had financial problems before they were married,
but  she  avers her  current  debt  is  largely  due  to  her  husband’s  drinking  and  gambling.
However, Applicant testified that her husband’s vices have not been an issue for them
since 2008. More recently, he has had sporadic employment since 2016 which, in 2018,
caused them to fall behind on their mortgage and lose a car to repossession. Applicant
has not sought any professional financial counseling or other assistance, but she testified
that, now that her husband is again employed, they can afford to file, and would be able
to make payments under, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection “to save the house.” She
indicated they would file such a petition a few days after her hearing. (Answer; GX 1; GX
2; Tr. 28 – 29, 35, 40 – 42, 60 – 63, 70 – 71)
In 2013, Applicant’s husband was injured in a car accident and had to leave his
job of 25 years without retirement benefits. In 2016, he  received a $59,000 settlement
from that accident. In July 2016, Applicant and her husband paid $10,000 down on a new
house,  financing  the  remaining  $80,000  with  a  mortgage.  After  paying  for  repairs  and
other costs associated with that purchase, they had about $45,000 remaining. In August
2016, Applicant and her family went on a one-week cruise. Applicant did not specify for
what other purposes they used the settlement funds. Applicant’s current finances are not
sound. She has incurred additional unpaid debts over the past year, and her checking
account was overdrawn by about $400 as of the day of her hearing. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 44,
51 – 59, 63 – 64)
