Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 1.e. He admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d in
part and denied them in part.3 His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 47 years old. He is a retired U.S. Air Force officer and F-16 pilot who
is  employed  by  a  defense  contractor.  He  and  his  wife  have  been  married  since  1995.
They have three children, ages 22, 21, and 10. Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in
1993  and  a  master’s  degree  in  2005.  He  served  in  the  Air  Force  from  1993  to  2016,
retiring  as  a  lieutenant  colonel.  Rated  as  a  “command  pilot,”  he  had  over  2,500  flying
hours and more than 300 hours flying over combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. He
has  worked  for  his  employer  in  the  defense  industry  since  May  2016,  as  the  deputy
director of one of the company’s divisions. He has held a security clearance for 26 years
1 When he answered the SOR, Applicant did not formally “admit” or “deny” the allegations. I noted this in
an  e-mail  to  counsel  before  the  hearing,  and  Applicant  addressed  each  allegation  during  hearing
preliminaries. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) I; Tr. 10-14)
2 Post-Hearing e-mail correspondence between myself and the parties is marked as HE IV. On December
21, 2019, when he provided Applicant’s post-hearing submissions, counsel requested “an indefinite delay
in  your  ruling  in  order  to  provide  ongoing  updates”  from  Applicant’s  counselor.  I  declined  to  hold  the
record open indefinitely for submission of evidence on an ongoing basis. DOD Directive 5220.6 ¶ E.3.1.10
states  that  “[t]he  Administrative  Judge  .  .  .  shall  conduct  all  proceedings  in  a  fair,  timely,  and  orderly
manner.”  (Emphasis  added)  Additionally,  ¶  E3.1.25  states  that  “The  Administrative  Judge  shall  make  a
written  clearance  decision  in  a  timely  manner  .  .  .”  An  applicant  is  not  entitled  to  a  delayed  or  deferred
adjudication of his or her security eligibility. ISCR Case No. 10-07892 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 7, 2011); ISCR
Case No. 09-02926 at 2 (App. Bd. May 11, 2010).
3  Applicant’s  partial  denials  as  to  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.d  largely  concerned  the  fact  that  the  allegations
misidentified the facility where he was treated and diagnosed. He otherwise admitted the substance of the
allegations. (Tr. 12-13, 28-29)
since he was commissioned as an Air Force officer. (Tr. 16, 53, 122-123, 159-162; Ans.
Encl. 11; SCA; AE G)
Applicant discussed his historical drinking pattern in his background interview. He
was  a  social  and  weekend  drinker  in  college.  He  drank  alcohol  sporadically  in  the  Air
Force until about 2012, when his drinking increased significantly after his wife  became
seriously ill. Applicant dealt with the resulting stress by  drinking frequently as a coping
mechanism.  He  said  in  his  background  interview  that during  this period, he  consumed
four  to  six  glasses  of  beer  or  wine  on  a  daily  basis.  (Tr.  165;  GE  2  at  12)  At  hearing,
Applicant  testified  that  his  drinking  became  “unhealthy”  sometime  in  early  2015,  and
that he was drinking habitually, four or five times a week at the time. (Tr. 145-147) He
said  no  one  came  to  him  at  the  time  and  said  he  was  drinking  too  much,  nor  did  he
realize that himself. (Tr. 190-191)
In  June  2015,  Applicant  was  stationed  at  a  military  base  near  where  he  now
lives,  in  State  1.  He  went  to  another  state,  State  2,  to  attend  a  conference.  The  night
before  he  was  to  return,  he  consumed  eight  to  ten  alcoholic  drinks  over  a  five-hour
period, alone in his hotel room. He had been working out beforehand, and had nothing
else to eat or drink. (Tr. 162-164; GE 2 at 11)
Applicant went to sleep after midnight. He woke at about 3:30 am and drove to
the  airport for  his  return  flight. While  en  route,  he  became  disoriented  and  entered  an
interstate  highway  by  driving  the  wrong  way  down  the  exit  ramp.  He  was  stopped  by
police after he was seen driving eastbound in a westbound lane. (Tr. 123-125, 163-164;
GE 2 at 11; GE 7 at 1)
Applicant  was  administered  a  breathalyzer  test  at  the  scene  and  registered  a
blood alcohol content (BAC) of .225. Results of a blood test later showed a BAC of .28.
He  was  arrested  and  initially  charged  with  driving  under  the  influence  (DUI)  and
reckless driving under State 2 law. (SOR ¶ 1.a) (Tr. 125; GE 7 at 1; GE 2 at 7, 11)
Applicant  immediately  disclosed  his  arrest  to  his  command.  Upon  returning,  he
was referred to the Air Force Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention Treatment (ADAPT)
program  and  diagnosed  in  early  July  2015  with  a  severe  alcohol  use  disorder  after
meeting 8 of the 11 criteria for alcohol use disorder under the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). (Tr. 126, 131, 144, GE 4 at 1)
Applicant  then  entered  recommended  inpatient  treatment  at  the  Substance
Abuse Rehabilitation Program (SARP) at a local Navy hospital. (SOR ¶ 1.b)4 While his
attendance was voluntary, he was also told that if he chose not to enter inpatient alcohol
treatment,  the  Air  Force  would  begin  administrative  separation  proceedings.  While  he
4  SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  that  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  alcohol  use  disorder,  severe,  while  in  inpatient
treatment  at  the  Navy’s  SARP  program,  when  in  fact,  the  initial  diagnosis  was  made  during  his  initial
alcohol evaluation by Air Force ADAPT providers. (Tr. 131; GE 4 at 2). While there is no documentation of
SARP’s diagnosis, Applicant testified that SARP accepted the diagnosis he received from the Air Force,
“and just put me into treatment.” (Tr. 150)
initially  preferred  outpatient  treatment,  he  also  recognized  that  he  had  a  problem  with
alcohol,  so  he  was  “easily  convinced  and  ready  to  get  help.”  (Tr.  126-127,  130,  135,
149-150, 166; GE 1 at 38, 46).
Applicant  was  in  inpatient  treatment  at  SARP  for  30  days  in  July  and  August
2015. He was considered “an active and motivated member of treatment groups,” and
he successfully completed inpatient treatment in August 2015. (Tr. 131, 151, GE 4 at 2;
GE 5; Ans. Encl. 3)
Applicant’s  continuing  care  and  aftercare  plan  developed  by  ADAPT  in  August
2015, which he acknowledged by signature, detailed certain requirements over the next
12 months. They included: 1) abstinence from alcohol; 2) participation in at least one to
three  self-help  group  meetings  per  week  (Alcoholics  Anonymous,  or  “AA”);  3)  weekly
follow-up  counseling  with  his  ADAPT  counselor;  and  4)  participation  in  a  formalized
continuing care group on a weekly basis for the next 12 months. (Tr. 131-132, 151-153;
GE 5 at 2-3)
Applicant testified at hearing that his abstinence “was unrelated to the treatment”
he  received  at  SARP,  but  was  instead  “related  to  me  wanting  to  fly  again.”  (Tr.  151;
Ans.  Enc.  3)  The  documentary  record  says  otherwise,  however,  as  abstinence  from
alcohol is the first requirement listed in the ADAPT program. (GE 5 at 2)
After  inpatient  treatment,  Applicant  transitioned  to  the  ADAPT  continuing-care
abstinence group, where he continued treatment on a bi-monthly basis. He met with a
counselor  to  discuss  treatment  goals  (maintaining  abstinence  from  alcohol,  improving
stress  management  skills  and  improving  his  marriage).  He  attended  meetings  with  a
local alcohol-abstinence support group, what he called “AA for aviators,” became more
engaged  at  church,  and  began  marital  counseling.  (Tr.  131-133,  167-169;  GE  4  at  2;
Ans. Encl. 3)
In  September  2015,  Applicant  received  a
from  his
commanding  officer  as  a  result  of  his  arrest.  (SOR  ¶  1.c)  The  letter  noted  that,  in
addition to the civilian  charges of DUI and reckless driving, he  was also in  violation of
Article  111  of  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ)  for  drunken  operation  of  a
vehicle. (GE 7 at 1) A determination was made to adjudicate Applicant’s DUI in State 2
criminal  court,  so  Applicant  was  not  formally  charged  by  military  authorities.  (Tr.  126-
128; GE 2 at 7)
letter  of  reprimand
In  October  2015,  after  two  months  in  continuing  care,  Applicant  transitioned  to
the  aftercare  phase  of  the  ADAPT  program.  (SOR  ¶  1.d)5  During  this  phase,  he  met
monthly  with  his  ADAPT  program  manager,  an  Air  Force  captain  in  the  Biomedical
Service  Corps  (BSC). He  also  continued  attending  other support groups,  including  the
5  SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  that  Applicant  received  aftercare  treatment  with  ADAPT  at  the  Navy  hospital  from
August  to  October  2015,  and  was  again  diagnosed  with  alcohol  use  disorder,  severe.  In  fact,  Applicant
began  the  Aftercare  program  in  October  2015,  after  two  months  in  the  “continuing  care  abstinence
group,” and the program was run by the Air Force, not the Navy.  Applicant said he did not recall a “new
diagnosis” at that stage. (Tr. 152)
“AA for aviators”  program.  He  abstained from  alcohol throughout the  program,  verified
by lab tests. (Tr. 131-133, 154, 167-169; GE 4 at 2; GE 6; GE 7 at 3-6; Ans. Encl. 3)
In  February  2016,  Applicant  requested  an  updated  alcohol  evaluation  from
ADAPT  in  order  to  maintain  his  flight  status.  His  DSM-V  diagnosis  at  that  time  was
alcohol  use  disorder,  severe,  in  early  remission,  because  he  had  no  demonstrated
symptoms for “longer than three months but less than one year.” (GE 4 at 3-4)
The  ADAPT  providers  noted  that,  given  the  “beneficial  and  socially  supportive
nature” of Applicant’s participation in marital therapy and the “AA for aviators” group,
it is recommended that he continue to engage in these therapeutic outlets
in the future (i.e., post-ADAPT treatment), in order to continue his upward
prognostic  trajectory  and  best  assist  him  in  the  maintenance  of  his
abstinence as well as the continued remission of his condition.6
Given  this  evidence,  and  given  Applicant’s  stated  desire  to  maintain  a  sober
lifestyle and to continue progressing towards recovery, his  prognosis was regarded as
excellent. It was estimated that in the absence of relapse, his condition would eventually
meet  the  criteria  for  alcohol  use  disorder,  severe,  in  sustained  remission  if  he
demonstrated no symptoms for over a year. (GE 4 at 4)
Applicant  was  allowed  to  maintain  his  flight  status.  (Tr.  132-133,  161,  170)  He
was  subject  to a  retirement  grade  determination but  was  allowed  to  retire from  the  Air
Force as a lieutenant colonel in early May 2016.7 (GE 2 at 7; Ans. Encl. 5; AE A – AE C)
Applicant did not complete the Air Force’s ADAPT aftercare program because he
retired  from  the  Air  Force.  (Tr.  137,  181)  The  record  does  not  indicate  that  Applicant
pursued a civilian alternative to the ADAPT program once he retired.
Applicant’s DUI case in State 2 remained pending until February 2017, when he
pleaded guilty to one count of DUI, extreme BAC, .15 – .19. The remaining charges, a)
DUI; b) DUI – liquor BAC .08 or more; c) DUI extreme BAC .20 or more; and d) reckless
driving) were dismissed. (GE 3; GE 1 at 40-41) Applicant was sentenced to 12 months
of unsupervised probation, which he completed. He was ordered to pay about $3,000 in
fines, fees, and costs, which he did in October 2017. He had an ignition interlock device
installed on his car from May 2017 to May 2018, and had no violations. He attended a
Mothers  Against  Drunk  Driving  panel.  He  was  not  under  any  pre-trial  restrictions  from
State  2  authorities  before  he  pleaded  guilty,  and  was  not  required  to  abstain  from
alcohol while on probation. (Tr. 128-129, 155-158, 171-175; GE 1 at 41-42; GE 3; AE H)
6 GE 4 at 4 (emphasis added)
7  In  March  2016,  DOD  CAF  issued  Applicant  a  Memorandum  of  Intent  (MOI)  to  revoke  his  security
clearance,  alleging  security  concerns  due  to  the  DUI  arrest.  As  a  result,  his  security  clearance  was
suspended. Applicant responded to the MOI on March 15, 2016. (GE 8)  Because he retired from the Air
Force soon thereafter, it does not appear that the March 2016 MOI was ever adjudicated. (Tr. 189-190)
Applicant resumed drinking after leaving the Air Force. He said in his background
interview that he resumed drinking in June 2016 (about one year after the DUI). (GE 2
at 12) At hearing, he said he resumed drinking around his birthday, in September 2016
(about 15 months after the DUI). (Tr. 134-136, 158, 176-177)
Applicant testified that his current pattern of consumption is to have two to three
drinks about two or three times a week. He described his pattern as social drinking with
family  and  friends,  such  as  on  weekends  watching  football,  and  a  drink  on  special
occasions, such as birthdays or holidays. (Tr. 137-138, 177-178; GE 2 at 2, 12) He said
when he is on business travel, he takes customers out and will “probably have a couple
more drinks than my average.” (Tr. 138)
Applicant’s renewed consumption of alcohol is alleged as a security concern, as
it post-dates his treatment for alcohol use disorder. (SOR ¶ 1.e) In an affidavit submitted
with his Answer to the SOR, he reported that:
[Applicant’s  mental  health  doctor  during  ADAPT  treatment]  knew  I  was
abstaining  from  alcohol  during  treatment  and  that  I  was  hitting  or
exceeding all of my progress goals. My doctors also knew I had not made
a decision as to whether I would abstain forever, and complete abstinence
was  never  a  mandatory  part  of  my  long-term  treatment  plan.  In  fact,  I
recall several treatment sessions where we discussed that living sober did
not necessarily mean living dry.8
Applicant also stated in his affidavit that he was required to abstain from alcohol
only  as  long  as  he  was  on  flight  orders,  though  this  was  “not  an  official  part  of  my
treatment  plan.”  (Ans. Enc. 3  at  2)  He  asserted  in  his  affidavit  that his resumed  social
drinking  has  been  safe  and  responsible,  and  without  any  adverse  issues,  either
personally  or  professionally.  Applicant  also  attested  that  “my  responsible  consumption
of  alcohol  is  completely  in  line  with  my  treatment  plan,  as  explained  to  me  by  my
doctors when I completed treatment.” (Ans. Encl. 3 at 2) He testified that he was never
told by his doctors that he could never drink alcohol again. (Tr. 133, 158, 171) Applicant
was  not  told  by  anyone  else  that  he  is drinking  too  much.  (Tr. 191)  These  statements
are  unsupported  by  updated  corroborating  documentation.  Applicant  did  not  indicate
that  he  currently  drinks  to  intoxication,  and  he  reported  no  additional  alcohol-related
offenses or “negative incidents.” (Tr. 138, 176; GE 2)
After retiring from the Air Force, Applicant continued marital counseling. He also
supported  his  wife  as  they  sought  medical  care  at  various  hospitals  for  her  medical
conditions,  as they  raised  their  three  children.  He  began  a busy  travel schedule  in  his
current job. Applicant attended the “AA for aviators” support group for about a year and
benefitted from it, but stopped going in part because it was geographically difficult to get
there.  (Tr.  182-183:  GE  2  at  12)  Applicant  offered  no  evidence  at  hearing  that  he  is
8 Ans. Encl. 3; see also Tr. 133-134.
currently  participating  in  AA  or  any  similar  counseling  group,  nor  did  he  indicate
sustained involvement with a formal support network to help him address his drinking.
Applicant testified that after the DUI, he was prohibited from driving in the county
in  State  2  where  the  offense  occurred.  (Tr. 174) Shortly  before  his  DOHA  hearing,  he
was on a business trip in another state, and was told that his driver’s license was about
to  expire,  which  he  had  not  noticed.  Even  though  he  had  lived  in  State  1  for  several
years, he still had a driver’s license from State 3, where he had served in the Air Force
from 2007 to 2010. (GE 1 at 17) When he sought to get a new license, he learned that
his  State  3  driver’s  license  had  been  suspended  as  a  result  of  the  DUI.  Applicant
testified that he was unaware of this, and said that he did not drive until his license was
renewed. (Tr. 183-188)
After the hearing, Applicant presented documentation from State 3 of an alcohol
assessment  he  underwent  in  November  2018  in  order  to  have  his  driving  privileges
renewed there (a prerequisite for getting a valid license in State 1). He testified that he
was issued a valid driver’s license from State 1 a few days before his hearing. (Tr. 183-
188)
The assessment is from a licensed professional counselor (LPC) in State 1.  (AE
J;  AE  L)  She  met  with  Applicant  for  one  hour,  in  November  2018.  (AE  I)  The
assessment summarizes the procedural history of the DUI case in State 2, Applicant’s
treatment  and  counseling,  retirement  from  the  Air  Force,  and  the  requirements  of  his
probation.  The  assessment  does  not  mention  Applicant’s  June  2015  diagnosis  of  a
severe  alcohol  use  disorder,  or  the  February  2016  diagnosis  that  his  disorder  was  in
early remission at that time. The documentation does not include an updated diagnosis
of Applicant’s alcohol use disorder.
With respect to a prognosis, the assessor finds that Applicant “did not present as
a risk to himself or others regarding the use of alcohol.”  The LPC found that Applicant
demonstrated that “he is managing his stress level and appears to be functioning within
normal limits at this time.” (AE J at 15/26)
The  assessor  noted,  however,  that  a  “plan  should  be  in  place  for  [Applicant]  to
manage  his  stress  levels  and  not  [succumb]  to  relapse  or  alcohol  abuse.”  (AE  J  at
13/26)  Counseling  was  recommended  to  help  him  manage  his  stress  and  his  wife’s
health issues. (AE J at 16/26) After the hearing, Applicant e-mailed the LPC and said he
wanted  to  begin  counseling  with  her.  (AE  K)  There  is  no  indication  of  additional
counseling with the LPC as of the date the record closed.
In his testimony, Applicant acknowledged his poor judgment the night of the DUI.
He  referred  to  the  event  as  “life-changing.”  He  intends  to  continue  making  “good
personal decisions” and relying on his support network of family, friends and counselors
going forward. He is also very patriotic, and understands the security significance of his
actions.  He  accepted  responsibility  for  his  actions  and  was  remorseful.  (Tr.  123,  139-
143)
Two witnesses from Applicant’s current employment testified. Witness 1 (W1) is
a senior lead engineer for Applicant’s employer. Applicant is one of his supervisors, but
they  work  in  separate  geographic  areas.  Witness  2  (W2)  is  the  facility  security  officer
(FSO) for Applicant’s employer and several of its subsidiaries. (AE D) He  served in the
Air  Force  for  30  years,  retiring  as  a  master  sergeant.  Both  W1  and  W2  have  had
clearances  for  many  years.  Applicant’s  work  performance  is  “beyond  reproach”  and
“stellar.” Applicant has been upfront about the DUI, and uses it as a cautionary tale for
others. The incident had a “huge impact on him.” W1 and W2 are aware that Applicant
abstained from alcohol for a year and has resumed drinking.  As the FSO, W2 has had
interaction  with  others  who  have  had  alcohol  issues.  He  noted  no  “telltale”  signs  of
alcohol  issues  with  Applicant.  He  said  it  would  be  a  security  concern  if  Applicant  had
repeated  alcohol  issues,  but  he  had  none,  but  for  the  DUI.  Both  W1  and  W  2  rate
Applicant  a  “10”  (on  a  1-10  scale)  for  national  security  trustworthiness  and  suitability.
(Tr. 37-49; (Tr. 50-55; AE D)
Two  other  witnesses  testified  who  had  firsthand  knowledge  of  the  DUI  and  its
aftermath. Witness 3 (W3) and Witness 4 (W4) are both retired Air Force colonels. W3
was the deputy division chief at the Air Force command where Applicant  served at the
time of the DUI. W4 was Applicant’s supervisor at the time, and he issued Applicant GE
7,  the  letter  of  reprimand.  Applicant’s  performance  at  the  command  was  “outstanding”
and  “exemplary.”  Both  W3  and  W4  recommended  that  Applicant  retain  his  rank  at
retirement. (AE A; AE B) W3 testified that he has “absolute faith and trust” in Applicant,
and he provides a valuable service to the Air Force in his position. W3 regards Applicant
as a “fine gentleman.” (Tr. 71-108)
W4  is  aware  of  Applicant’s  participation  in  alcohol  treatment.  W4  said  that
Applicant’s  professionalism  “never  wavered”  after  the  DUI.  He  said  Applicant  was
forthcoming,  admitted  his  mistakes,  and  wanted  to  move  forward  from  them.  W4
believes  Applicant  has  learned  “a  tremendously  difficult  lesson.”  Applicant’s  judgment,
trustworthiness,  and  reliability  are  “upstanding  [and]  of  the  highest  order”  and  he
believes Applicant should have a clearance. (Tr. 89-108; AE B; AE E)
Witness  5  (W5)  is  Applicant’s  brother.  He  testified  by  phone.  He  is  a  police
sergeant  in  a  large  U.S.  city.  He  is  professionally  experienced  with  the  importance  of
confidentiality,  privacy,  and  the  protection  of  sensitive  information.  W5  testified  that
Applicant is a loving father and family man with excellent character. (Tr. 111-113) W5 is
aware of the DUI, but has never known Applicant to otherwise behave irresponsibly with
alcohol. W5 is aware of Applicant’s alcohol treatment, his one year of abstinence, and
the  fact  that  he  has  resumed  drinking.  It  does  not  cause  W5  concern  with  respect  to
Applicant’s  ability  to  safeguard  secrets.  W5  considers  his  brother  a  role  model  and
“moral  compass.”  He  has  always  admired  Applicant’s  patriotism,  dedication,  and
commitment to his family. (Tr. 111-119)
