In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  60-year-old  engineer  employed  by  a  defense  contractor.  He  was
employed  by  defense  contractors  from  June  1981  to  February  2002.  He  worked  as  a
civilian employee of the U.S. Navy from February 2002 to March 2008. He has worked as
a program manager for a defense contractor from April 2008 until the present. He has
held a security clearance since 1981.
Applicant graduated from college with a bachelor’s degree in May 1981. He has
completed  graduate  course  work  in  metallurgical  engineering  but  has  not  received  a
graduate degree. He married in October 1981. He and his wife have four adult children.
Applicant  did  not  timely  file  his  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  from  2008
through 2016. He relied on his concept of a “three-year rule,” under which he could file a
return and receive a refund without penalty within three years of the due date for a tax
return. His understanding of the “three-year-rule” was based on his own research and not
on advice from a tax professional. His plan was to delay filing each year’s return until he
was certain that his refund from a previous year was sufficient to cover any taxes due.
(Tr. 18-19, 28.)
When Applicant filed an SCA in April 2012, seeking to continue his clearance, he
disclosed that he had not timely filed his federal and state income tax returns for 2008,
2009, and 2010, and that he owed a total of about $18,361 for 2008; $12,828 for 2009;
and $6,061 for 2010. He explained that, due to “unorganized business accounting,” he
did not have the required forms to support filing his returns on time. He also explained
that he paid estimated taxes but had miscalculated the amount of taxes due. (GX 2 at 32-
33.) During a personal subject interview (PSI) in April 2012, he told an investigator that
he was concerned about the impact of the tax issues on his security clearance, that he
had retained a tax consultant and a bookkeeper to assist him with his tax and returns,
and that he expected to file all past-due returns by the end of May 2012. (GX 4 at 6.) He
1 Applicant submitted AX A through Q with his answer to the SOR. He resubmitted them at the hearing,
along with AX R, S, and T. (Tr. 8.)
2 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1), his personal
biography (AX B), and his personal resume (AX C), unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation
to the record.
testified  at  the  hearing  that  all  past-due  returns  were  filed  by  the  end  of  2012,  but  he
admitted that he did not hire someone to help him with his taxes. (Tr. 30.)
When Applicant responded to financial interrogatories from the DOD CAF in June
2014, he provided federal and state tax transcripts for 2008 through 2011. The transcripts
reflected that he filed his state return for 2008 in April 2012 and federal return for 2008 in
June 2012. (GX 4 at 16, 24.) He filed his state return for 2009 in July 2012 and his federal
return for 2009 in August 2012. (GX 4 at 18, 29-30.) He filed his state return for 2010 in
July 2012 and his federal return for 2010 in August 2012. (GX 4 at 19, 33-37.) He filed his
state return for 2011 in February 2013 and his federal return for 2011 in June 2014. (GX
4 at 22, 45.) At the end of the interrogatories, he commented:
I would like to emphasize that while my returns were late, it is because I
assumed I had a refund coming and there are no penalties for late personal
returns.  .  .  However,  it  is  clear  to  me  now  that  the  late  filings  are  poorly
regarded from an investigation standpoint. I have hired a new tax advisor to
help me keep up with the process.
(GX 4 at 8.) Notwithstanding his failures to timely file his federal and state tax returns, his
security clearance was never suspended or revoked. (Tr. 36.)
When Applicant submitted his most recent SCA in March 2017, he disclosed that
he had failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for 2010 through 2015.
(GX 1 at 35-38.) In response to interrogatories from the DOD CAF in February 2018, he
submitted tax transcripts reflecting that he filed his federal return for 2012 in June 2016,
his federal return for 2013 in August 2016, and his federal return for 2014 in August 2016.
(GX 3 at 5-8.) He submitted an account history from the state tax authority reflecting that
his state returns for 2011 through 2014 had been filed. (GX 3 at 15.) He submitted copies
of his federal and state returns for 2015 and 2016, along with evidence that the federal
returns for 2015 and 2016 were mailed in June 2018 and the state returns for 2015 and
2016 were personally delivered to the state revenue authority in January 2018. (GX 3 at
9-14, 16-19.) At the end of these interrogatories, he commented,
Regarding reasons for my late filing, in the past since I knew I had a refund
coming I would wait to file my return to make sure the following year was
adequately covered with withholding, estimated taxes, or prior tax year carry
over. I only offer this as my rationale as to why there were late. I did not fully
appreciate the impact of delinquent returns on my clearance eligibility. It is
clear to me now that the late filings are poorly regarded from a clearance
standpoint. [To] help ensure timely returns going forward, I am now working
with a tax preparation company in my town to help with the process. I have
already met with the [name redacted] tax preparation service and discussed
preparation plans for my 2017 return, which I am currently preparing and
will file on time.
(GX 3 at 4.) He received an extension of time to file his federal income tax return for 2017
and filed it in July 2018. (AX T.) He filed his state income tax return, which was due on
May 1, 2018, on June 9, 2018. (AX I.) The record does not reflect whether he requested
and received an extension of time to file his state return for 2017.
In October 2018, Applicant executed a “Statement of Intent,” declaring his intent
to never again fail to untimely file his federal and state income tax returns, and agreeing
that any future failures to time file or pay taxes would be grounds to revoke his national
security  eligibility.  (AX  S.)  In  November  2018,  Applicant  hired  a  business-advising
company to help him with tax planning and compliance. (AX R.)
Applicant’s annual salary is about $94,000. (Tr. 16.) He testified that between 2008
and 2016, he usually received a tax refund. (Tr. 22.) He is financially secure. At the time
of  the  hearing,  he  had  $2,400  in  his  checking  account.  (AX  N.)  In  June  2018,  he
completed an online credit-counseling course, a budget analysis, and a financial action
plan.  (AX  O;  AX  P.)  As  part  of  the  budget  analysis,  he  indicated  that  he  has  monthly
income of about $10,312; expenses of about $9,855; and a net remainder of about $457.
(AX P.) This information was generally consistent with a personal financial statement that
he submitted with his answer to the SOR. (AX M.) A credit report from June 2018 reflects
no negative information. (AX Q.)
Four former and current coworkers submitted letters on Applicant’s behalf. They
describe him as an outstanding mentor; a skilled, personable, dedicated, and respected
engineer;  and  a  dedicated  spouse  and  parent.  They  consider  him  a  person  of  high
integrity  and  honesty,  who  is  truthful  and  forthright,  even  under  difficult  or  stressful
conditions. (AX A.)
