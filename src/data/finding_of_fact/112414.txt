Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  in  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.l,  and  denied  the
allegations in ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 33 years old. He attended college for approximately two years, but did
not earn a degree. He married in 2014, and has a four-year-old child. He served in the
Army Reserve from March 2006 to May 2016, and was honorably  discharged. He has
been employed by a federal contractor since February 2017.1
In his June 2017 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), Applicant
disclosed  his  work  history  and  periods  of  unemployment:  he  worked  part-time  from
February 2006 to April 2010, and was a drilling reservist from March 2006 to April 2010;
active duty from April 2010 to February 2013; unemployed from February 2013 to April
2014;  active  duty  from  April  2014  to  May  2016;  and  unemployed  from  May  2016  to
February 2017.2
In Applicant’s response to Section 26 of his SF 86 that requested information about
financial delinquencies, he disclosed one debt owed to a satellite television service in the
amount of $173. He noted that it would be paid immediately. No other debts turned over
to a collection agency, defaulted loans or debts that had been delinquent over 120 days
or were currently over 120 days delinquent were disclosed.3
In  December  2017,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator.
Applicant attributed his financial problems to unemployment after being discharged from
the military. He took a job with a federal contractor working overseas so he could address
those financial problems. He intended to pay all of his delinquent debts. In his answer to
each debt alleged in the SOR, he stated: “I admit. However, the conditions occurred under
unique such circumstances that are unlikely to recur and should not cast doubt on my
current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.”4

4 Item 2, 4.
Applicant further disclosed to the investigator that in February and March 2017, he
was unable to pay his rent. His wife was working at the time, but he was not. Her income
was insufficient. He arranged a payment plan with the landlord to pay the overdue rent.5
Applicant disclosed to the investigator that in July 2014, he received notice that
because he failed to return his apartment’s pool pass he owed $30. He was employed at
this time, but his wife was not. He did not have the money to pay that debt. He was notified
by mail in July 2014 that the debt was turned over to a collection company. He intended
to pay the debt in January 2018. He told the investigator that he was now earning $85,000
tax free while he was working in Kuwait. He forgot to list this debt when he completed his
SF 86.6
Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  he  owed  approximately  $18,000  to  the  DOD
due  to  an  overpayment  made  to  him  for  a  period  of  six  months.  He  said  that  he  was
released from the military in May 2016, but he did not receive his official DD 214 discharge
document until September 2016. He said he continued to receive pay from May 2016 to
September 2016. He said he did not think anything of the fact that he was still receiving
pay. After he received his DD 2014 the pay stopped. He said he thought this was normal.
In January 2017, Applicant was notified by the Defense Financial and Accounting
Service  about  the  overpayment and informed  that  he  owed $18,000. Applicant  did  not
take action to repay this debt because he did not have the money. He told the investigator
that he did not have the address to contact the creditor for this debt. He intended to obtain
a copy of his credit report to obtain the information. He believed the debt may have been
turned over to a collection company. He intended to repay the debt in full beginning in
January 2018. He reiterated to the investigator that his current income was $85,000, and
he planned to use his income to repay all of his debts. He failed to disclose this debt on
his  SF  86  because  he  forgot  about  it.  (SOR  ¶  1.a-$17,655).  Applicant  did  not  provide
evidence that he has made arrangements to repay this debt.
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($10,409), 1.c ($8,866), 1.d ($7,692) 1.e ($5,780) and
1.h ($589) are credit card debts, and the debt in ¶ 1.g ($820) is owed to a furniture store.
The debts  were  incurred  while  Applicant  was  unemployed from  May  2016  to  February
2017. He used the credit cards to pay living expenses. During this period, Applicant was
unable to pay the credit cards and furniture store. He told the investigator that the credit
cards were in collections. He said he did not have a payment plan, and he could not afford
to pay the debts. He planned to use his salary to repay the debts. He intended to obtain
a  credit  report  and  start  making  payments  on  the  debts  in  January  2018.  He  failed  to
5 Item 4. I have not considered for disqualifying purposes any derogatory information that was not alleged
in  the  SOR.  I  may  consider  information  when  making  a  credibility  determination,  in  the  application  of
mitigating conditions, and in my whole-person analysis.
6 Item 4.
disclose  these  debts  on  his  SF  86  because  he  forgot  them.  He  did  not  provide  any
information about the status of these debts. They are unresolved.7
The  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.j  ($96)  is  a  medical  debt  owed  for  services  provided  to
Applicant’s daughter in May 2016. Applicant told the investigator he was unable to pay
the debt when it was due. He said that it was still unresolved, but he would use his salary
as a federal contractor to pay it. He did not provide evidence the debt is paid.
Applicant was confronted by the investigator with the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i ($176);
1.k ($1,464), and 1.l ($80). He said he was unfamiliar with these accounts. He told the
investigator he would obtain a credit report and begin contacting creditors and establish
payment plans.
The  delinquent  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  are  corroborated  by  Applicant’s
admissions  in  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  statements  to  the  government  investigator, and
credit reports from July 2017 and February 2018.8
Applicant denied that he intentionally failed to disclose on his June 2017 SF 86
that  he  had  debts  turned  over  to  a  collection  agency;  had  a  credit  card  suspended,
charged off, or canceled for failing to pay as agreed; in the past seven years had been
over 120 days delinquent on any debt; or was currently over 120 days delinquent on any
debt.  His  answer  stated:  “I  used  a  credit  report  pulled  that  same  day.  However,  I  was
unaware that the report was incomplete or inaccurate.”9
