Applicant is 69 years old. She was married for 24 years and has been a widow
since  2008.  She  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1971.  In  approximately  2012,  after
working as a medical records technician for 21 years, she retired. She has worked for her
current employer since February 2016. She attributes her financial issues to her four-year
period of retirement between 2012 and 2016. (Item 6).
The  SOR  alleges  12  delinquent  debts,  totaling  over  $87,000.  Additionally,
Applicant failed to disclose delinquent debts in her November 2016 SCA. In Applicant’s
Answer to the SOR, she admitted to some of the allegations, but claimed that several of
the debts were resolved. She also denied the one Guideline E allegation.
During her November 2017 personal subject interview (PSI), Applicant volunteered
to  the  government  investigator  that  she  had  defaulted  on  her  mortgage.  She  did  not
disclose any other debts until she was confronted by the investigator. Applicant told the
investigator that she failed to disclose the delinquent debts in her SCA due to “oversight”
or they became delinquent after she completed the SCA in  November 2016. She also
claimed that she had set up payment plans for several of the debts, including SOR ¶¶
1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k. At that time, Applicant told the investigator that she
had not sought credit counseling.  (Item 6 at 4-9)
In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed that she did not falsify her SCA, but
there was a problem “with the system and answers to questions.” She also claimed that
she told the investigator “about [her] bills that were in collection, charged off and [she]
was enrolled with a debt consolidation program.” (Item 2 at 4)
During  her  four  years  of  retirement,  Applicant  was  supported  by  retirement
savings;  however,  this  money  was  insufficient  to  pay  her  bills  and  numerous  debts
became delinquent. The alleged debts became delinquent between 2014 and 2016. (Item
3; Item 6)
2 The Directive’s provisions for amending the SOR are permissive. See ISCR Case NO. 08-02404 at 5
(App.  Bd.  Jun.  5,  2009)  and  Additional  Procedural  Guidance  E.3.1.17.  Applicant  did  not  object  to  DC’s
motion to amend; therefore, I will amend the SOR per DC’s request.
3 SOR ¶ 1.h was changed from $467 to $867. SOR ¶ 1.j was changed from $6,638 to $7,661.
4  Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  her  security  clearance  application  (Item  3)  unless
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
