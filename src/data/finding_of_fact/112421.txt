Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  1.e  –  1.i,  and  1.k.  He  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.c,
1.d,  1.j,  and  1.l.  For  most  allegations,  he  included  a  brief  explanation.  His  admissions
and explanations are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings
of fact.
Applicant is 56 years old. He was married from 2000 to 2009. He has one adult
son.  Applicant  has  a  high  school  diploma  and  some  community  college  credits.  He
served in the United States Navy from 1980 to 2000, retiring as a chief petty officer (E-
7). He has worked in the defense industry ever since, either for his current employer, or
its predecessor. He has had a security clearance for 18 years. (Tr. 12, 26-30, 57; GE 1)
The  SOR  first  alleges  that  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  and  state
income  tax  returns,  as  required,  for  tax  years  2011  to  2016.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b)  The
1 Applicant initially did not specifically “admit” or “deny” SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.j. He did so in a September 14,
2018 e-mail to DOD CAF that is included in his Answer.
2  In  post-hearing  correspondence,  I  referred  to  Applicant’s  post-hearing  exhibits  as  AE  A  through  D.
(Hearing  Exhibit  III)  Since  his  hearing  exhibit  is  already  marked  as  AE  A,  I  have  re-marked  his  post-
hearing exhibits sequentially, starting with AE B.
remaining allegations concern past-due federal and state income taxes. (SOR ¶¶ 1.c –
1.l)
On his January 2016 SCA, Applicant disclosed unfiled state and federal income
tax returns for 2014 and 2015 and some tax debt. (GE 1 at 31-37) He discussed his tax
situation  in  personal  subject  interviews  conducted  in February  2017,  September 2017,
and December 2017. (GE 2)
Applicant  prepared  and  mailed  his  state  and  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax
years 2011 to 2016 in May 2018, while preparing GE 2, his interrogatory response. (Tr.
33-38,  53-56)  When  he  signed  GE  2,  in  June  2018,  he  indicated  that  his  returns
remained unfiled, but clarified at hearing that though he had mailed the returns, he did
not consider them “filed” until he had received confirmation of receipt from the IRS and
the state tax authority. (Tr. 38-42)
Applicant also stated that he owed about $24,278 combined in past-due federal
income taxes for 2011-2016, with specific amounts detailed for each year. (SOR ¶¶ 1.e
– 1.i; 1.k) He explained at hearing that he calculated those figures based on the returns
that he prepared at that time. (Tr. 53) He stated that he had requested a payment plan
with  the  IRS.  He  stated  that  he  owed  $500  in  past-due  state  income  taxes  for  those
years.  (SOR  ¶  1.l)  He  did  not  provide  documentation  from  the  IRS  or  the  state  tax
authority, though he was requested to do so. (GE 2) He said this was because he did
not keep copies of the returns, which is also why he was not able to provide them at his
hearing. (Tr. 40)
Applicant has lived in the same house since 2010. (Tr. 28-30; GE 1) The home
he shared with his wife was foreclosed in 2009, after she stopped paying the mortgage,
he said. He disclosed the foreclosure on his SCA. (GE 1) It is not alleged in the SOR,
and is not reflected on credit reports in the record. (Tr. 28-30) Applicant and his former
wife  remain  on  good  terms.  For  a  time,  he  paid  her  rent  ($600  a  month)  but  stopped
doing that to have more money to pay his back taxes. Applicant’s former wife now lives
with him. (Tr. 32)
Applicant  explained  that  his  tax  debts  and  filing  problems  arose  from  two
circumstances,  both  arising  after  his  2009  divorce.  First,  he  stated  that  for  several
years,  he  had  not  received  his  IRS  form  W-2  related  to  his  Navy  pension,  from  the
Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS). He acknowledged at hearing that, though
he received W-2’s regularly from his employer, he never reported to DFAS that he had
moved in 2010, which could explain why he did not receive his Navy W-2s. (Tr. 30-31;
GE 1; GE 2) Since he did not have his Navy W-2s, he did not file his tax returns, and
chose instead to wait passively until he received them. This went on for several years,
through tax years 2011 to 2016. Applicant testified he procrastinated and that “it slipped
my  mind.”  Applicant  did  not  rectify  his  issues  with  DFAS  until  he  prepared  his
interrogatory response. (Tr. 30-31, 36)
Second,  Applicant  also  acknowledged  at  hearing  that,  although  he  had  been
divorced from his wife since 2009, he never changed his tax filing status to reflect that
he was no longer married. As a result, he incurred significant federal income tax debt,
since  his  taxes  were  being  calculated  on  the  basis  of exemptions  to  which  he  was  no
longer entitled. (Tr. 44-45)
Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  1.j,  a  2015  wage  garnishment  by  the  IRS  for  $7,115,
and said he did not recall it. (Tr. 52) However, he also disclosed that garnishment on his
SCA,  with  the  exact  dollar  amount.  (GE  1  at  34)  Applicant  also  denied  SOR  ¶  1.c,  a
$3,856 state tax lien issued in 2010. Both debts are on GE 5, an incident report relating
to Applicant from DOD’s Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). (GE 5; Tr. 45-46)
The tax lien at ¶ 1.c is no longer reflected on more recent credit reports. (GE 3, 4)
Applicant denied SOR ¶ 1.d, a $21,279 federal tax lien, also issued in 2010. (GE
5) He testified that when he learned of the lien, he went to the bank and paid it off with a
check, in full. (Tr. 48-52, 55) He provided proof of the payment after the hearing. (AE C)
Applicant  denied SOR  ¶  1.l,  the  $500  state tax  debt from  tax  years  2011-2016.
He  paid  the  debt  in  April  2018.  (AE  B;  Tr.  56)  Applicant  also  stated  that  he  does  not
know if he owes any additional state taxes because he was told that those returns are
“in  processing”  with  state  tax  authorities. They  told  him there are no  outstanding  state
liens. (Tr. 33-34) He provided no state income tax returns, and no documents from state
tax authorities about the status of his returns and state tax debt, even after the hearing.
Applicant said he had a tax advisor when he owned his marital home and paid a
mortgage, but has not otherwise had a tax counselor or pursued credit counseling. He
has not sought tax advice available to him through the military. (Tr. 69-74)
AE  A  is  Applicant’s  payment  agreement  with  the  IRS,  dated  July  3,  2018.  It
references tax years 2016 (alleged) and 2017 (not alleged).3 Applicant is to pay $600 a
month for six  years (a total of about $43,000), through automatic withdrawals from his
checking account. His first payment was on August 10, 2018. (AE A; AE D; Tr. 42-43,
67-69) No other tax payments are documented.
AE A does not reference any other tax years. There are no other documents from
the IRS in the record. Applicant’s tax returns from 2011-2016 are also not in evidence.
Thus,  there  is  no  documentation  of  what  Applicant  currently  owes  in  past-due  federal
taxes, penalties and interest.
Applicant’s supervisor attested that Applicant is responsible and trustworthy. He
has  integrity.  He  is  reliable,  efficient,  and  has  an  excellent  work  ethic.  He  works  well
3 Applicant testified that he filed his 2017 state and federal income tax returns on time, and paid what he
owed. (Tr. 31, 54) The reference in AE A to the 2017 tax year suggests that Applicant may owe past-due
taxes for that year. However, there are no additional details in the record on that point, so I do not make
that inference.
with  others,  and  is  an  easy-going  and  well-liked  team  member.  He  is  a  “phenomenal
employee.” (AE E)
