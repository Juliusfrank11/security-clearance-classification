In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 2.a,
2.b, 3.a, 3.c, and 4.a. He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.

(Tr.  6,  24)  In  2005,  he  graduated  from  a  university  and  received  a  bachelor’s  degree;
however, the physical diploma was lost, and despite “back and forth” between Applicant
and  the  university,  he  was  unable  to  get  another  copy  of  the  diploma.  (Tr.  27-28)  In
December 2011, he received a technical information technology certification. (Tr. 25) He
intends to complete another “year or so” of classes so he can receive another bachelor’s
degree. (Tr. 6; AE B; AE H) In 2007, he received an on-line master’s degree; however,

several awards. (Tr. 112)
Applicant served in the Army from August 1988 to August 1991. (Tr. 7) His Army
military occupational specialty (MOS) was encrypted signal interceptor. (Tr. 7-8) While he

Sexual Behavior
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges in April 1991, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment (NJP)
for  four  acts  of  voyeurism,  in  violation  of  Article  134,  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice
(UCMJ). A military police report indicates a person generally fitting Applicant’s description
was inside the female shower area looking at female soldiers coming out of or inside the
showers on four occasions from December 26, 1990, to January 17, 1991. (GE 11 at 5-
7) He received company grade NJP of forfeiture of 7 days of pay, reduction from specialisr
to private first class, 14 days of restriction, and 14 days of extra duty. (GE 11 at 4) In May
1991, Applicant wrote a statement addressed to his company commander in which he
admitted he had a problem with voyeurism; he traced his problem to sexual abuse when
he was a child and unresolved anger; he wanted therapy; and he requested a discharge
from the Army. (GE 11 at 2-3) At his hearing, he said he was outside someone’s room
looking in, and he viewed people inappropriately on two or three occasions. (Tr. 58) He
said he was caught each time he did it. (Tr. 58) He received some therapy before he was
discharged from the Army. (Tr. 60) In August 1991, he received a general discharge under
honorable  conditions  for  misconduct.  After  he  was  discharged  from  the  Army  and
continuing until the middle of 1993, he received therapy to recognize and resist triggers
for voyeurism. (Tr. 62) The triggers to his desire for voyeurism were emotional extremes
such as becoming too angry, hungry, or lonely. (Tr. 62)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  in  April  1994,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  four
counts of aggravated sexual battery. Applicant said that because he was angry about his
life, particularly his lack of financial success and low-paying employment, he “graduated”
from  voyeurism  to  “frottage.”  (Tr.  63)  According  to  the  Merriam-Webster  Dictionary,
frottage is “the act of obtaining sexual stimulation by rubbing against a person or object.”
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/frottage.  Applicant  said  he  was  in  a  club,
and  someone  touched  a  woman  inappropriately  on  her  rear.  (Tr.  64)  He  may  have
bumped her. (Tr. 64) She accused Applicant of touching her inappropriately, and he was
arrested  and  charged  with  sexual  assault.  (Tr.  64)  Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to  sexual
assault.  (Tr.  64)  In  his  SOR  response,  he  said,  “Against  my  own  desire,  I  touched  a
woman inappropriately in a public place.” At his hearing, he denied that he touched her
touched  one  woman
inappropriately.
inappropriately; however, he denied that he touched the other three women. (Tr. 66) He
said  that  “[o]ut  of  camaraderie,  they  all  said  that  I  did.”  (Tr.  66)1  He  conceded  that  he
pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual assault on four women. (Tr. 67-68) He claimed he
only touched one woman, and the touching was unintentional and not sexual. (Tr. 67-68)
He  pleaded  guilty  because  the  prosecutor  reduced  the  four  felony-level  aggravated
sexual battery charges to four misdemeanor-level sexual battery charges. (Tr. 68-69) He
(Tr.  65)  He  subsequently  admitted  he
1 In his August 1, 2016 Officer of Personnel Management personal subject interview (OPM PSI),
Applicant said in 1992 or 1995, he was walking on the street and touched a woman’s breast. (GE 2 at 15)
He did not realize he touched the woman’s breast. (GE 2 at 15) In his November 15, 2016 OPM PSI, he
said that the act was not intentional or conscious. (GE 2 at 21) He was arrested for sexual assault. (GE 2
at 15)  A  1992  police report indicates  Applicant  was riding  a bicycle  and he reached out and grabbed  a
woman’s breast. (GE 3) He was charged with sexual assault. (GE 3) The disposition of this allegation is
unknown. It was not addressed during his hearing, and it was not alleged in the statement of reasons (SOR).
No adverse inference is made against Applicant because of this allegation.
served  30  days  for  each  misdemeanor-level  conviction  and  paid  a  substantial  fine
(between $1,000 and $2,000). (Tr. 69-70) He was on probation for three years. (Tr. 70)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges in September 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with
solicitation of prostitution. Applicant went with an undercover police woman to a motel,
and when he arrived, some police came out of the bathroom and arrested him. (Tr. 74-
76) He was found guilty of soliciting a prostitute and fined $335. (Tr. 75) He denied that
he offered the undercover police woman any money. (Tr. 75-76) The police report states,
“The  subject  wanted  to  commit a  sex  act for  $30.00.”  (GE 5 at  3) He  said he  pleaded
guilty without admitting that he offered her money for sex. (Tr. 75)
Criminal Conduct
SOR  ¶  2.a  cross-alleges  the  conduct  in  SOR  ¶  1.  SOR  ¶  2.b  alleges  that  in
December  2005,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  petit  larceny.  (GE  4)  An
employee of a drug store said Applicant picked up two items and walked out of the store.
(Tr.  80) The police  accused  Applicant  of  stealing.  (Tr.  78)  Applicant pleaded  not  guilty
and told the judge he purchased the items earlier from a different store. (Tr. 79) The judge
found him guilty of petty larceny, and Applicant believed he was convicted because he
was unable to produce the receipts for the items. (Tr. 79) He was sentenced to 12 months
in jail with 10 months suspended. (Tr. 81)
SOR ¶ 2.c alleges that in July 2010, Applicant was arrested and charged with petty
theft. Applicant said he was in a store and someone left their wallet at the register. (Tr.
82) Applicant took the wallet and attempted to return it to its owner who was outside the
store. (Tr. 83) The wallet was returned to the owner. (Tr. 83) The owner said $200 was
missing from his wallet. (Tr. 83) Applicant was convicted of “petty larceny.” (Tr. 84-85) He
received a $200 fine and was required to pay $150 in court costs. (Tr. 84)
Financial Considerations
Applicant was unemployed from August 2012, to June 2014, and from November
2014 to December 2015. (Tr. 45-46, 49) He lived in a homeless shelter for two months,
and he lived in his car for a time. (Tr. 48-49) He used the unemployment time to burnish
his  credentials  and  earn  information  technology  certifications.  (Tr.  46)  He  recently
received several salary increases, and his current salary is around $104,000. (Tr. 45, 100)
He receives 30 percent disability pay ($497 monthly) from the Department of Veterans
Affairs. (Tr. 108)
Applicant’s SOR alleges the following financial issues:
SOR  ¶  3.a  alleges  his  student  loan  for  $2,272  was  charged  off.  Applicant  is
currently enrolled in college, and he believed the correct loan status should be deferred.
(Tr. 40) He has about $12,000 in student loans that are not deferred because he “took a
pause at school.” (Tr. 73) He owes approximately $46,000 in student loans and they are
in deferment because he has been enrolled in a bachelor’s degree program since 2016.
(AE B) This debt is mitigated.
SOR ¶ 3.b alleges a collection debt for $350. Applicant was unaware of the source
of the debt, and he used a credit repair company to dispute his responsibility for it. (Tr.
42-43) This is the only SOR debt in collections. Applicant is credited with mitigating this
debt.
SOR  ¶  3.c  alleges  a  delinquent  child-support  debt  for  $55,584  owed  to  a  state
department of social services. Applicant said he started paying child support in 1996 or
1997. (Tr. 36) He said he consistently made child-support payments for the past three
years,  and  whenever  possible  he  pays  extra  to  reduce  the  arrearage.  (Tr.  87)  In  his
November  15,  2016  Officer  of  Personnel  Management  personal  subject  interview,
Applicant  said  his  child-support  arrearage  was  $46,715.  (GE  2  at  21)  His  current
arrearage is about $48,000. (Tr. 72) In October 2018, he owed the following amounts for
four children: $22,613; $9,988; $3,900; and $11,728, for a total of $48,229. (Tr. 71; AE
G) He currently pays $475 through a wage withholding or garnishment2 for one child and
$475 for his arrearage or a total of $950 per two-week pay period. (Tr. 36-37, 100) He
said  this  amounts  to  $1,400  or  $1,400  monthly.  (Tr.  100)  He  said  he  pays  extra  each
month in addition to the wage withholding. (Tr. 38) His November 16, 2018 child-support
statement indicated he paid $760. (AE G) In June 2018, he ended the garnishment and
is voluntarily paying his child-support debt. (AE A; AE G) This debt is not mitigated.
Applicant was unsure when he filed his federal income tax returns for tax years
2014 and 2015. (Tr. 114) He said he had not “completely” filed tax returns for the last five
years. (Tr. 113, 115) He said, “I have not filed taxes for 2017 yet, but I have filed taxes
for ’15 and ’14.” (Tr. 114) He said he filed his 2016 tax return. (Tr. 114) I asked him to
provide his Internal Revenue Service Form 1040s for the previous three years. (Tr. 116)
Applicant did not object to Department Counsel’s proposed amendment of the SOR to
add SOR ¶¶ 3.d through 3.g.
SOR  ¶¶  3.d  and  3.e  allege  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  income  tax
returns for tax years 2016 and 2017. (Tr. 117) SOR ¶¶ 3.f and 3.g allege Applicant failed
to timely file his state income tax return for tax years 2016 and 2017. (Tr. 117)
After  Applicant’s  hearing,  he  provided  documentation  depicted  in  the  following
table for tax years 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2017 (not 2015).
2 Of course, Applicant loses some mitigating credit because his child support payments were made
through garnishment of his salary even though his opportunity to establish a payment plan may have been
limited at times because of unemployment, lack of income, and other financial commitments. Payment of a
debt  “though  garnishment  rather  than  a  voluntary  effort  diminishes  its  mitigating  force.”  Compare  ISCR
Case No. 08-06058 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2010) with ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26,
2006) (payment of two of four debts through garnishment did not bar mitigation of financial considerations
concerns). See also ISCR Case No. 09-05700 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011) (garnished payments towards
delinquent tax debts is not mitigating information in light of other factors); ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 6
(App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009) (remanding the case to the administrative judge and stating when addressing an
Internal  Revenue  Service  garnishment,  “On  its  face,  satisfaction  of  a  debt  through  the  involuntary
establishment  of  a  creditor’s  garnishment  is  not  the  same  as,  or  similar  to,  a  good-faith  initiation  of
repayment by the debtor.”).

Applicant’s state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014, 2016,
and 2017 did not indicate that he owed any federal or state income taxes. (AE C-AE F)
Applicant said he did not need to file a tax return for tax year 2012 because his income
was too low, and he said his tax preparation service said he did not need to file tax returns
if it was more than six years ago. (AE A) If the IRS wants to pursue tax evasion or related
charges, it must do this within six years from the date the unfiled return was due. This six-
year  time  limit  does  not  remove  the  requirement  to  file  tax  returns  prior  to  2012.  No
adverse  inference  is  made  about  whether  Applicant  has  failed  to  file  or  timely  file  tax
returns other than those for tax years 2014, 2016, and 2017.
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 4.a alleges that Applicant was terminated from his employment in January
2016 for viewing inappropriate material on a computer while at work. (Tr. 51-57) While at
work, he was on a website where women do “silly things” such as “twerking” or “shaking
their butts.” (Tr. 53) He said not all of the videos on the website are sexually oriented. (Tr.
55)  He  was  working  at  the  front  desk  of  a  hotel,  and  another  employee  saw  the
inappropriate video and reported him to management. (Tr. 53) He said the problem was
he walked away from the desk, and he failed to close out the video. (Tr. 53) The time he
was caught on the website at work was not the first time he viewed material from that
website at work. (Tr. 56-57) SOR ¶ 4.b cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1
and 2.
Character Evidence
Applicant provided 19 pages of letters and emails positively describing his work
and contributions to his community from 1996 to 2011. (AE I) The statements laud his
integrity, responsibility, dependability, and intelligence. (AE I) He worked numerous hours
as a volunteer and often helped others with computer problems. (AE H) He presented
certificates  and  diplomas,  dated  from  1996  to  2015,  documenting  his  training  and
education accomplishments.
3 The income threshold for filing his 2013 tax return was $10,000 (filing status single under age 65),
and Applicant was not required to file a tax return for tax  year 2013. See IRS Publication 501, Cat. No.
