Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  the  SOR  with  explanations.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 54 line
13 to page 60 line 1, and GX 1 at pages 5~6.) He has been employed with the defense
contractor  since  2003,  and  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  2004.  (TR  at  page  54
line 13 to page 60 line 1, and GX 1 at pages 15~16.) He is respected in the workplace.
(AppXs E~G.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
Although  Applicant  had  some  health  issues,  as  attested  to  by  his  wife  (TR  at
page 23 line 12 to page 25 line 19), they attribute their financial difficulties to an inability
to handle a sudden abundance of wealth, about $200,000 from his mother-in-law’s trust
fund. (TR at page 18 line 5 to page 19 line 25, and at page 61 line 6 to page 62 line 2.)
They began living beyond their means. (TR at page 61 line 6 to page 62 line 2.)
1.a. Applicant admits that he failed to file his state income tax return for tax year
2014. (GX 3 at page 22.) He has offered nothing further in this regard. This allegation is
found against Applicant.
1.b. Applicant initially admitted that he failed to pay his state income taxes for tax
years 2011~2014. However, the Government has offered evidence that Applicant has a
“$0.00”  balance  for  tax  years  2011  and  2013.  (GX  3  at  pages  25  and  27.)  It  also
appears that Applicant has a payment plan with the state for tax years 2012 and 2014.
(TR at page 86 line 8 to page 89 line 20, and GX 3 at pages 28~32.) This allegation is
found for Applicant.
1.c. Applicant initially admitted that he failed to file his Federal income tax returns
for  tax  years 2011~2016.  However, he  has offered  evidence  that he  has now  filed  his
Federal  tax  returns  for  tax  year  2016.  (TR  at  page  65  line  24  to  page  66  line  5,  and
AppX B.) As the filings for tax years 2011~2015 still remain outstanding, this allegation
is found against Applicant.
1.d.~1.g. Applicant admits that he owes the Federal government about $38,271
in  past-due  taxes  for  tax  years  2011~2014.  (TR  at  page  95  line  1  to  page  96  line  13,
and  Answer  at  attachments  B~E.)  Although  he  averred  that  he  would  submit  post-
hearing  documentation  showing  a  payment  plan  with  the  Internal  Revenue  Service
(IRS) in this regard, Applicant has offered nothing further. These allegations are found
against Applicant.
1.h. Applicant initially admitted that he failed to pay his past-due Federal income
taxes for tax year 2015. In his Answer, Applicant has offered evidence showing this debt
has been paid. (Answer at attachment F.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.i. Applicant admits that he has past-due student loans totaling about $55,818.
He has now set up a payment  plan by which he will make monthly payments of  $332,
beginning in February of 2019, towards this admitted past-due debt. (TR at page 76 line
21  to  page  81  line  20.)  This  is  evidenced  by  documentation  submitted  by  Applicant.
(AppX  I.)  I  find  that  Applicant  is  making  a  good-faith  effort  to  address  his  past-due
student loans; and as such, this allegation is found for Applicant.
1.j.  Applicant  admits  that  he  has  a  past-due  medical  debt  for  $331,  but  has
submitted nothing further in this regard. (TR at page 81 line 21 to page 83 line 14.) This
allegation is found against Applicant.
1.k.,  1.l  and  1.q.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  additional  past-due  medical
debts  totaling  about  $126,  but  has  offered  documentation  that  he  has  successfully
disputed these medical debts. (TR at page 81 line 21 to page 83 line 14, and AppXs K
and L.) These allegations are found for Applicant.
1.m. Applicant initially admitted that he had a past-due debt to Creditor M in the
amount  of  about  $242,  but  has  submitted  post-hearing  documentation  that  he  is
addressing  this  debt.  (TR  at  page  83  line  15  to  page  84  line  3,  and  AppX  M.)  This
allegation is found for Applicant.
1.n.  Applicant  initially  admitted  that he  had a  past-due  debt  to  Creditor N in  the
amount  of  about  $179,  but  has  submitted  post-hearing  documentation  that  he  is

for Applicant.
1.o.  Applicant  initially  admitted  that  he  had  a  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  O  in  an
unspecified  amount,  but  has  submitted  post-hearing  documentation  that  he  is
addressing  this  debt.  (TR  at  page  84  line  13  to  page  85  line  9,  and  AppX  O.)  This
allegation is found for Applicant.
1.p. Applicant admits that he has a past-due to Creditor P in the amount of $29,
but  has  submitted  nothing  further  in  this  regard.  (TR  at  page  85  lines  10~17.)  This
allegation is found against Applicant.
