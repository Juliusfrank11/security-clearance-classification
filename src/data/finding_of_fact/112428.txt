After considering the FORM, Applicant’s response to the FORM, and his response
to the SOR (Item 1), I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 50-year-old foreman and has worked for a defense contractor since
November 1999. He holds a confidential clearance, which is required for him to perform his
job. From September 1987 through September 1990, he honorably served in the U.S.
Army.  (Item  2)  His  rank  while  serving  is  not  contained  in  the  record.  In  April  2004,  he
married his wife. He had previously been married from December 1989 through July 1993.
(Item 2) His son, who lives with him, is 17 years old and he has two adult step-children.
(Item 3) The record does not reveal if his wife is currently working, what her income is if
working,  his  income,  the  amount  of  the  household’s  income,  or  what  their  monthly
expenses are.
In 2012, Applicant purchased a truck with monthly loan payments of $520. In 2014,
the truck was repossessed when his payments were three months delinquent. He became
delinquent on his payments when his adult step-children moved in with him, and he started
paying their bills. Following the repossession, a $12,710 (SOR 1.a) debt resulted. (Item 3)
The debt has been transferred from the original creditor to a collection agency. (Item 3) As
of October 2017, he had not made any payments on the debt because he asserts he has
not been contacted by the original creditor since the repossession. (Item 3) In his PSI, he
indicated he intended to satisfy this debt, but did not provide a date for doing so. (Item 3)
This delinquent obligation appears on his February 2016, January 2018, and July 2018
credit reports. (Item 4, Item 5, Item A)
Applicant, in his January 20, 2016 e-QIP, failed to list the 2014 repossession even
though  Section  26  specifically  asked  him  to  list  any  repossession that  occurred  in  the
previous seven years. (Item 2) He stated he did not list the debt on his e-QIP due to an
oversight.
During Applicant’s PSI, he indicated the $61 medical collection debt (SOR 1.g) may
have been his copayment on one of his children’s medical bill. He intended to look into the
account and satisfy it at some future date. (Item 2) He believes the $176 collection account
(SOR 1.f) was the final bill for his cable service. He intended to satisfy the debt at some
future date. He had no knowledge about the $305 cable collection debt (SOR 1.b). This
delinquent obligation appears on his February 2016, January 2018, and July 2018 credit
reports. (Item 4, Item 5, Item A) He incurred a $1,026 delinquent obligation (SOR 1.d) on a
rental agreement that was charged off in January 2014. (Item 4) He had a $388 credit card
debt (SOR 1.e) charged off in August 2009. (Item 4)
During the November December 2008 time period, Applicant became behind on his
$800 monthly rent when his wife lost her job. (Item 3) He answered “no” on the question on
his  e-QIP  that  asked  if  during  the  previous  seven  years  he  had  been  evicted  for  non-
payment of rent. The record is insufficient to show that an eviction occurred only that he
became delinquent on his rent payments. Based on the amount owed the landlord, he was
more than six months behind on his rent. In February 2009, the landlord obtained $5,231
judgement against Applicant. (Items 3 and 6) A garnishment of $450 to $500 every two
weeks was obtained against Applicant. (Item 3) As of July 2010, $4,536 was yet owed on
the $5,231 garnishment. (Item 6) As of October 2010, $2,990 was yet owed on a $3,331
garnishment. It is not clear from the record if these garnishments were the same obligation.
In March 2003, a garnishment of $2,919 was obtained by a different creditor. In February
2012, another creditor obtained a garnishment of $1,998. (Item 6) In November 2013, a
judgment action was filed against Applicant in the amount of $983 (SOR 1.c). (Item 4) The
judgment  remains  unsatisfied.  In  his  SOR  response,  he  asserted  he  did  not  list  his
garnishments on his e-QIP because he asserts the garnishments had occurred before
2010. (Item 1) He provided no documentation supporting the garnishments occurred prior
2010, which was the seven-year period of concern in the e-QIP.
When Applicant completed his January 20, 2016 e-QIP, he answered “no” when
asked if during the past seven years he had any property repossessed, had his wages
garnished,  had  bills  turned  over  to  a  collection  agency,  had  accounts  charged  off,
suspended or canceled, or had ever been more than 120 days delinquent on any debt. He
had had accounts turned over for collection, other accounts that had been charged off, and
other accounts that were more than 120 days delinquent. Additionally, he answered “no”
when asked if a judgment had been entered against him during the previous seven years.
The November 2013 judgment had been entered against him only three years earlier. He
also  answered  “no”  when  asked about his wages being garnished during the previous
seven years even though garnishment actions had been entered against him in March
2010, July 2010, October 2010, and February 2012. (Item 6)
Applicant in his July 2018 SOR response, he denied falsifying his e-QIP or any other
document. (Item A) Included with his SOR response were copies of his July 2018 credit
reports.
