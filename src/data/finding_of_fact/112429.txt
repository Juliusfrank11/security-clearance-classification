In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  with  comments  all  of  the  factual
allegations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.i.). Applicant’s admissions and comments
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the
evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due  consideration  of  same,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a service technician with his current employer since October 2016. A 1997 high school
graduate,  Applicant  received  an  associate’s degree  in 2011.  He never served  with  the
U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance. Applicant was married in October
1999, and separated in June 2011. He has been cohabiting since July 2014. He has two
children, born in 1999 and 2009.
Financial Considerations1
During his enhanced subject interview conducted by an investigator from the U.S.
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  in  September  2017,  Applicant  attributed  his
financial issues to his separation from his spouse after he found out about her infidelity;
child  support  payments;  and  several  periods  of  unemployment.  He  had  previously
reported in his e-QIP that he had been unemployed from July 2009 until June 2010; from
December  2010  until  March  2011;  from  June  2011  until  September  2011;  and  from
1 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in
the following exhibits: Item 2 (e-QIP, dated March 31, 2017); Item 3 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated
September  28,  2017);  Item  6  (Answers  to  Interrogatories,  dated  February  19,  2018);  Item  4  (Combined
Experian,  TransUnion,  and  Equifax  Credit  Report,  dated  May  18,  2017);  Item  5  (Equifax  Credit  Report,
dated December 20, 2017); Item 1 (Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, dated June 11, 2018).
December 2011 until August 2012. During his periods of unemployment, Applicant was
supported  financially  by  unemployment  compensation,  his  father,  or  by  his  personal
savings,  and  he  spent  his  time  hunting  for  a  job,  doing  chores  on  the  family  farm,  or
attending school.2 Those combined factors made it difficult for him to remain current on
his bills and child support, and some accounts became delinquent, and he developed a
child support arrearage. The arrearage was resolved in August 2013 when the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) applied his tax refund to the debt, and he borrowed $3,000 from
his family to make the final payment.3
The SOR identified nine delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection
or charged off as generally reflected by Applicant’s May 2017 or December 2017 credit
reports. Applicant claimed that some of the accounts may have been generated by his
wife,  or  because  she  broke  their  informal  agreement  that  he  would  work  to  earn  the
money, and she would stay home and pay the bills.4 He acknowledged that he has not
entered into any agreements or made any payments to the creditors, although he said in
his Answer to the SOR that he hoped to start doing so by July 2018.5 Those debts, totaling
approximately $38,625, are described below:
There are seven delinquent student loans (SOR ¶ 1.a., for $7,745); (SOR ¶ 1.b.,
for $6,863); (SOR ¶ 1.c., for $6,646); (SOR ¶ 1.d., for $4,938); (SOR ¶ 1.e., for $4,306);
(SOR ¶ 1.f., for $3,277); and (SOR ¶ 1.h., for $3,211), that remain unresolved, with no
evidence of any efforts by Applicant to either contact the creditor(s), enter into  repayment
arrangements, or make even small periodic payments. There are also a satellite television
account (SOR ¶ 1.g., for $401), and a cellular telephone account (SOR ¶ 1.i., for $1,238),
that remain unresolved, although Applicant previously indicated the former would be paid
off by July 2018, and the latter would be paid off by November 2018.6
Applicant failed to indicate his monthly net pay, monthly expenses, debt payments,
or if he has any monthly remainder that might be available for discretionary spending or
savings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of financial counseling.
Applicant offered no evidence to indicate that his financial situation has improved, or that
it is now under control.

6 It should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts
in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting
in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR
Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).
