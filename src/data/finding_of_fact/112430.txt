After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 45-year-old defense-contractor employee with a bachelor’s degree
awarded in 1995 and a master’s degree awarded in 1997. More recently, he took some
online courses between October 2011 and May 2012 and night classes in person at a local
private university. Applicant has worked for his employer since November 2017, initially
learning electrical drafting. In April 2018, he transferred to detail planning for a full-time
salaried position, and in December 2018, he was scheduled for another transfer to quality
control.  (GEs  1-2;  Tr.  29-31.)  Applicant  has  never  previously  held  a  DOD  security
clearance and understands that he does not need clearance eligibility to keep his current
job. (Tr. 33.)
Applicant and his spouse married in 1998, and they have two children ages 13 and
16. (GE 1; Tr. 30.) Applicant’s spouse has a bachelor’s degree and also a law degree,
which she earned in 1998. She practiced law for only about 1.5 years. In approximately
February 2002, she stopped working while pregnant with their daughter and was a stay-at-
home mom for the next 15 years. (Tr. 33-35.)
In 2003, Applicant moved his family to their current state of residence for him to
work at a new private boarding school as a teacher. His salary decreased by $10,000 to
about $30,000, but housing was provided. (Tr. 26-37.) In January 2009, Applicant and his
spouse purchased their residence in a short sale for $175,000 to $180,000. (GE 1; Tr. 46-
47.)
While employed at the boarding school, Applicant began taking college classes part
time at night and also online. (GE 1; Tr. 57-59.) Between August 2009 and January 2014,
he  obtained  Federal student loans totaling approximately $115,951.1 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.j).
(GEs 2-5.) In August 2011, Applicant left his employment at the boarding school. (GE 2.)
He  taught  at  a  magnet  school  for  the  next  academic  year  with  a  temporary  teacher
certification.  His  contract  was  not  renewed  after  the  school  year  because  he  had  not
finished  his  schooling  for  his  teacher  certification.  (GE  1;  Tr.  36-39.)  Applicant  was
unemployed during the summer of 2012, but then taught at another school from August
2012 to June 2014. (GE 1.) In July 2013, his vehicle was repossessed for nonpayment of a
car loan obtained for $20,497 in October 2007. With funds obtained from his parents, he
paid off the debt and redeemed the vehicle in January 2014. (GEs 2-5.)
In August 2014, Applicant began teaching in a public school system. He was allergic
to the mold in the building and resigned for health reasons when the school year ended in
June 2015. Applicant began working as a teacher for another public school system in July
2015, but he left the job in February 2016 because his daughter had been diagnosed with
a disability. Over the next 21 months, he worked on and off as a substitute teacher for
several school districts earning $75 to $85 an hour. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 36-42.) Due to lack of
income and medical bills (Tr. 71), he did not make any payments on his Federal student
loans which he was obligated to repay starting in July 2015. Nine of his student loans were
rated as seriously delinquent as of October 2016. (GEs 2-5.) Applicant and his spouse
became delinquent on their mortgage loan in October 2015, and foreclosure proceedings
commenced in approximately April 2016. (GEs 2-3; AE A.) A lien was placed on their home
in July 2017 for nonpayment of a medical judgment debt of approximately $360. (AE E; Tr.
25, 53-54.)
In April 2017, Applicant’s spouse began working during the day as a school para-
professional 18 hours per week at $17 an hour and nights and weekends at a public library
four  to  eight  hours  per  week  at  $11  an  hour.  (Tr.  27-28,  44-45.)  In  September  2017,
1  Applicant  testified  that  one  or  two  of  his  student  loans  are  consolidated  loans  for  his  undergraduate
education, but that most of his loans were incurred for his graduate school and his education coursework. (Tr.
57, 60.) Two of his student loans are consolidated loans obtained on July 6, 2012. (GEs 3-5.) The loans
consolidated in 2012 may be from his undergraduate education.
Applicant began working as a part-time math teacher at a night school three hours per
week at $60 an hour. (Tr. 33.) He was otherwise unemployed. (Tr. 42.)
On  August  16,  2017,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to an inquiry concerning
any financial delinquency involving enforcement in the last seven years, Applicant indicated
that a lien was against his house for nonpayment of a medical debt that had been brought
to judgment. He indicated that he had arranged to pay $150 by the end of August 2017 and
to pay the $157 remaining by the end of September 2017. He disclosed no other past-due
debts. (GE 1.)
As of September 12, 2017, Applicant’s student loans were $119,910 past due and in
collection (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.j). A credit-card account opened in February 2013 was past due
and  in  collection  for  $2,743  (SOR  ¶  1.l).  A  second  credit  card  with  the  same  creditor,
obtained in December 2014, was in collection for $3,252 (SOR ¶ 1.k). A music and arts
debt for $1,086 was in collection as of August 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.m). Medical collection debts
of  $435  from  July  2015  (SOR  ¶  1.o),  $121  from  August  2015  (SOR  ¶  1.p),  and  $447
assigned in May 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.n) were also outstanding. (GE 2.)
On September 27, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant explained about the medical debt
disclosed on his SF 86 that he and his spouse could not pay the bill because they were
unemployed at the time. When asked whether he owed any other delinquencies, Applicant
volunteered  that  his  home  loan  was  in  foreclosure,  and  that  he  had  several  other
outstanding past-due balances. When confronted with the details of his debts, Applicant
averred that he thought his student loans were in deferment because of his unemployment.
He acknowledged the outstanding credit card and music debts, and explained that the
music debt was for a saxophone for his son. Applicant acknowledged that he owed medical
debts,  and  that  one  medical  provider  had  obtained  a  judgment  lien  on  his  home.  He
indicated  that  he  had  paid  $187.70  toward  the  debt  but  still  owed  $180.15.  As  for the
mortgage, Applicant admitted that his  mortgage loan was in foreclosure for the last 18
months, but that he was in mediation to resolve the delinquency.2 He indicated that he was
seeking full-time employment for the income to allow him to begin repaying his delinquent
debts. (GE 2.)
In November 2017, Applicant began his defense-contractor employment at an hourly
wage of approximately $16 while continuing to work nights as a math teacher until June
2018. (GE 2; Tr. 31-33.) Applicant was re-interviewed by the investigator on November 13,
2017. He was unable to provide any update to his financial situation other than to indicate
that he could try to pay off his debts now that he had full-time employment. (GE 2.)
A  check  of  Applicant’s  credit  on  January  9,  2018,  revealed  no  progress  toward
resolving his Federal student loans, which totaled $189,722 and were $134,911 past due.
The credit card debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.l had been charged off. Applicant also owed
2 Applicant testified that he was paying an attorney $500 a month until December 2018 to assist him and his
spouse in obtaining a modification of their home mortgage loan. (Tr. 65-66.)
three medical collection debts for $435, $326, and $121. Applicant was making payments
on six consumer credit accounts with balances totaling $2,465. (GE 4.) On March 6, 2018,
Applicant paid the $435 medical collection debt (SOR ¶ 1.o).
In  April  2018,  Applicant  underwent  a  department  transfer at  work for a  salaried
position at $48,000 annually (approximately $23 per hour). He routinely works five to ten
hours per week in overtime. (Tr. 31-32.) During the summer of 2018, Applicant’s spouse
filled in for several employees at the library, and she worked extra hours. (Tr. 44.)
On  July  20,  2018,  Applicant  agreed  to  pay  $5  per  month  for  nine  consecutive
months as a trial rehabilitation for his defaulted Federal student loans. His first payment
was due September 15, 2018. Under the agreement, Applicant agreed to continue to make
monthly payments after the minimum nine payments until he is notified in writing by the
loan servicer that the  rehabilitation has been completed. The loan servicer would then
establish a new monthly payment amount based on the balance owed at the time the loans
are rehabilitated. (AE C.) In September 2018, Applicant made a payment of approximately
$249 that was disbursed among his Federal student loans. (GE 5.) As of November 2018,
his Federal student loans totaled $241,503. (AE C.)
On September 27, 2018, Applicant entered into a Federal Housing Authority Trial
Repayment Plan for his delinquent mortgage loan with a principal balance of $177,110.
Under the terms, Applicant agreed to make monthly payments of $1,703 from October 1,
2018, through December 1, 2018. Should Applicant miss a payment, the state housing
authority  reserved  the right to a foreclosure action. Applicant made a $1,703 payment
posted on October 11, 2018. The housing authority acknowledged receipt of the payment
but issued a delinquency notice billing Applicant for the $57,205  past due on the loan.
Applicant was informed that failure to pay the $57,205 by November 1, 2018, could result
in fees and foreclosure. (AE B.) Applicant testified that he made  a second payment of
$1,703 in the week preceding his November 16, 2018 hearing (Tr. 48-49), but he provided
no documentation of that payment.
The creditor owed the balances in SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.l filed to garnish Applicant’s
wages to recover a judgment awarded for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k. On October 3, 2018,
Applicant asked for a modification to repay the debt at $75 per week. The creditor agreed
to the modification on October 22, 2018. (AE D.) After the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k is satisfied,
Applicant intends to have the garnishment continue until his other debt with the creditor
(SOR ¶ 1.l) is paid off. (Tr. 66-69.)
As of early to mid-October 2018, Applicant had not paid the $121 medical collection
debt from August 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.p). He contacted the provider and was referred to the
collection entity that has no record of the debt. (Tr. 75.) Two open credit-card accounts for
gasoline  were  past  due  in  amounts  of  $111  on  a  balance  of  $608  and  for  $120  on  a
balance of $607. He contacted the creditor owed the $608 debt and has initiated a plan to
address the delinquency in three installment payments. A retail charge card obtained in
August 2015 was $27 past due on a balance of $361. Applicant has a plan in place to
address that delinquency by January 2019. (Tr. 82-83.) He had made no payments on the
account  in  SOR  ¶  1.l  since  February  2017,  and  the  past-due  balance  had  accrued  to
$2,743. After a September 2018 payment on the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k, he owed $3,329 on
that delinquent account. Applicant was making timely payments on four open consumer
credit accounts with balances totaling $1,783. (GE 5.) The music debt in collection (SOR ¶
1.m) was no longer on Applicant’s credit report. Applicant recalls that he may have mailed
the  creditor  a  check  for  $700,  but  he  provided  no  documentation  to  corroborate  the
payment even though I left the record open for post-hearing submissions. (Tr. 73-74.) The
medical collection debt in SOR ¶ 1.n was no longer on his credit record as of November
2018. (GE 5.) Applicant believes that he made a payment to his daughter’s psychologist
(Tr. 75), but he provided no proof.
Applicant estimated that he had only $3 in his bank accounts as of mid-November
2018. He has retirement assets “in the thousands” in one account that he cannot access
before age 59½. He recently applied to close out an $8,000 teacher’s retirement account
and was notified that it would be processed effective December 31, 2018. He plans to use
the funds to pay some bills. (Tr. 77-78.) Applicant owes approximately $580 in Federal
income taxes for tax year 2017. When the taxes were due in April 2018, he entered into a
repayment  arrangement  with  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  to  repay  the  debt  in  $50
monthly installments, but there was a problem with debiting his account, so no payments
had been withdrawn from his account as of mid-November 2018. (Tr. 79-80.) Applicant’s
household  finances  have  improved  since  October  2017,  as  evidenced  by  the  housing
authority’s willingness to grant him the loan modification. He had previously been denied
modification because of insufficient income. (Tr. 80-81.)
Applicant estimates that he paid “thousands of dollars” in medical expenses for
therapy visits for himself in 2005 and for his children since 2012 or 2013. His children see a
therapist  once  a  month,  but  it  has  been  at  no  charge  for  the  past  year.  (Tr.  84-85.)
Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  a  form  of  high-functioning  autism  and  asks  that  it  be
considered in mitigation. (Tr. 52.)
