Unless  otherwise  indicated  by  citation  to  another  part  of  the  record,  I  have
extracted  these  findings  of  fact  from  SOR  Answers  1  and  2  (Item  1),  and  Applicant’s
2017 SCA (Item 3). Applicant is 45 years old. He shares two children, ages 14 and 19,
with  his  ex-wife,  whom  he  divorced  in  2008.  He  married  his  current  wife  in  2011.  He
honorably served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from 1995 through 2008, when he
was  medically  discharged.  He  earned  his  associate  and  bachelor’s  degrees  in  2007,
and his master’s degree in 2008. He has been employed by a defense contractor as a
professional services engineer since December 2016. He was previously granted DOD
security clearances in 1996 and 2005. Applicant submitted a SCA in 2009  (Item 2) for
reasons not specified in the record.
Applicant  experienced  three  periods  of  unemployment  after  his  2008  service
discharge: 1)  March  2009  through  May  2009,  after  his  employment  contract ended;  2)
December 2014 through November 2015, when he voluntarily left his employment after
having  a  conflict  with  his  supervisor  over  a  medical  leave  issue;  and  3)  May  2016
through December 2016, following a layoff. During his 2009 period of unemployment, he
was  supported  by  his  step-father,  other  family  members,  and  his  Department  of
Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  disability  benefits.  During  his  periods  of  unemployment  in  2014
and  2016,  he  was  financially  supported  by  his  wife’s  employment  income  and  his  VA
benefits. The record does not specify any dollar amounts for these alternate sources of
income. (Item 3 at 13-16, 15-23; Item 4 at 26-27)
In 2010, Applicant received a $62,000 lump-sum severance payment from the Air
Force. In 2015, he received a $177,000 inheritance in the form of a distribution from a
federal retirement account. Applicant attributed the eight delinquent debts alleged in the
SOR, which totaled $50,418 (including a $23,671 child-support arrearage and a $9,877
automobile loan) to his 2016 period of unemployment.
Applicant admitted all but one of the eight delinquent debts alleged in the SOR.
His admitted debts totaled $44,429. He denied the $5,989 judgment (SOR ¶ 1.h) on the
basis  that  he  was  “unable  to  find  any  evidence”  of  it  in  his  credit  report  or  during  a
search  of  County  A’s  judicial  records.  The  judgment  was  reported  in  the  2017  credit
report provided by the Government in the FORM. It was issued by a court in County B,
and remains unresolved. (Item 1; Item 5 at 3)
Between February and April 2019, Applicant resolved each of the seven admitted
SOR debts and paid off his federal student loans (which were not in delinquent status).
He paid a total of $35,105 to resolve the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, and 1.c through
1.g. He paid all but one (SOR ¶ 1.g/$737) of the  seven debts after receiving the SOR.
The amounts he paid to resolve the automobile loan (SOR ¶ 1.b) and pay off his student
loans were not specified in the record. (Item 1; Item 7 at 2; AE C)
In 2014, Applicant borrowed money to pay for the university where he earned his
bachelor’s  and  master’s  degrees  via  federal  student  loans  totaling  $47,278.  In
November 2017, when his loans were in deferment status, he promised  to resume his
loan  payments  in  July  2018.  The  record  did  not  specify  the  amount  or  duration  of  the
loan  payments  that  he  made.  However,  the  loans  were  paid  in  full  in  February  2019.
(AE B; Item 4 at 32)
Applicant  admitted  that  he  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  income  tax  returns  for
tax  years  2010  through  2013,  and  2016.  He  filed  his  2010  through  2013  returns  in
August  2014,  and  his  2016  returns  in  February  2018.  He  timely  filed  his  2014,  2015,
and 2017 returns. The status of his 2018 return was not specified in the record. (Item 4
at 7-22)
Applicant  also  failed  to  timely  pay  his  federal  income  taxes  for  tax  years  2010
through  2015,  and  2017,  which  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  He  owed  approximately
$22,293  (after  withholding  and  exclusive  of  penalties  and  interest).  He  established
installment  agreements  with  the  IRS  to  repay  his delinquent  taxes  in August 2014  (for
tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014); in June 2016 (for tax year 2015); and in
June 2018 (for tax year 2017). The IRS account transcripts reveal a sporadic payment
history  and  entries  suggesting  that  Applicant  received  hardship  accommodations.  By
March  2019,  the  tax  delinquencies  were  resolved  for  tax  years  2010  through  2017
through  amounts  paid  directly  by  Applicant  and  tax  refunds  applied  by  the  IRS  from
other  tax  years.  Between  2014  and  2018,  Applicant’s  payments  totaled  approximately
$8,359 for tax years 2010 through 2015, with no payments for tax year 2017. Because
the SOR alleged only the failure to timely file his tax returns, I will consider his failure to
timely pay his taxes only for the purposes of mitigation and whole-person analysis. (Item
4 at 7-22)
Applicant  did  not  specify  the  reason  for  his  failure  to  timely  file  his  tax  returns.
However,  he  attributed  his failure  to  timely  pay  his  taxes  to  having  insufficient  income
(due  to  unemployment  and  a  child-support  arrearage)  to  cover  the  additional  taxes
associated  with  unanticipated  income  earned  in  2010  and  2015.  He  reported  owing
additional  taxes  of  $20,000  following  the  2010  severance  payment,  and  $15,000
following the 2015 inheritance. (Item 3 at 42-43; Item 4 at 29)
By  late  2017,  Applicant  asserted  that  he  was  financially  stable  and  unlikely  to
have  a  recurrence  of financial  difficulties.  He  promised  to  resolve his delinquent  debts
when he could “afford to do so.” He has not had any financial counseling. (Item 4 at 29-
30, 31-32).
The record did not enumerate the income, including from the VA, that Applicant
or  his  wife  earned  or  their  ongoing  expenses  (besides  Applicant’s  child  support
obligation) since his 2008 discharge. Applicant reported his payments for child support
as $2,200 monthly, and for the arrearage as $1,150 bi-weekly. He asserted that he used
the money received from his 2010 severance and 2015 inheritance for living expenses
and debts caused by his 2008 divorce, without detailing any specific amounts. (Item 3 at
13-16 and 44; Item 4 at 26-27 and 29; Items 5 through 7)
Applicant  disclosed  a  prior  period  of  financial  instability  when  he  reported
delinquent  debts  totaling  $38,344  on  a  November  2009  SCA.  Applicant  did  not
specifically  address  the  underlying  cause  of  those  debts  in  the  record.  However,  his
2008 divorce and 2009 unemployment could have been factors. (Item 2; Item 4 at 29)
