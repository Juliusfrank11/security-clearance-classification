Applicant  admitted  both  of  the  SOR  allegations.  She  is  48  years  old.  She  was
born in Guyana. She immigrated to the United States in 1974 and became a U.S. citizen
in 1985. She married in 2001. She has two children, one adult and one minor, and  an
adult  stepchild.  She  has  owned  her  home  since  2001.  (Tr.  at  21-22,  77,  81,  123-124,
125-136; GE 1; AE M).
Applicant  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1992  and  a  master’s  degree  in  1993.
She  has  worked  for  various  U.S.  Government  contractors  since  approximately  1997.
She was unemployed after the birth of her child from May to December 2007, and she
was  briefly  unemployed  in  November  2015  and  January  2017.  As  of  the  date  of  the
hearing,  she  worked  as  a  program  analyst  for  her  employer,  a  Department  of  State
(DOS)  contractor,  since  February  2017.  She  was  first  granted  a  security  clearance  in
1996. (Tr. at 6, 17-21, 62-63, 85-90, 100-101, 136-148; GE 1; AE T).
The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns
for tax years 2012 through 2016, as required (SOR  ¶ 1.a). It also alleges that she was
delinquently indebted to the state tax authority for $6,230 in  state income taxes for tax
years  2012  and  2013  (SOR  ¶  1.b).  She  listed  her  failure  to  timely  file  and  pay  her
federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2012  through  2016  and  her  state  income  tax
returns for tax years 2014 through 2016 on her April 2017 security clearance application
(SCA). She also listed her failure to timely file her state income tax returns for tax years
2012 and 2013 on her 2017 SCA, stating that the state tax authority filed on her behalf
as a result. December 2017 IRS account transcripts reflect that Applicant did not timely
file her federal income  tax  returns for tax  periods  2012  through  2016,  and  though  she
was  given  extensions  until  October  2013,  October  2014,  and  October  2015  for  tax
periods 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively, she failed to file the relevant tax returns by
the extension deadlines. (Tr. at 26-28, 90-91; GE 1, 2; AE B, C).
Applicant  attributes  her  untimely  filing  of  her  relevant  federal  and  state  income
tax  returns  and  her  delinquent  state  taxes  to  unforeseen  circumstances  that  began  in
2013, when her husband was fired from his job. His employer of approximately 19 years
lost  its  contract  to  a  new  company  that  required  her  husband  to  provide  proof  of  a
bachelor’s degree for continued employment. He had misled both her and his previous
employer  to  believe  that  he  had  such  a  degree.  She  unsuccessfully  attempted,  from
January to March 2013, to prevent her husband from losing his job as he was only a few
classes short and had worked in his field for nearly 20 years. Their household income
dropped  from  $200,000  to  $90,000,  and  he  was  unemployed  from  about  March  to
August 2013 and April 2014 to April 2015. (Tr. at 26-27, 35-75, 91-101, 120-121, 125-
136; GE 1).
During  this  period,  Applicant  also  assisted  her  stepson  with  paying  an
indeterminate amount in legal fees for his then-pending criminal charges. She incurred
the additional expense of housing both her stepson, after his apartment eviction, and his
mother, after her incarceration release, when she temporarily permitted them to reside
in  her  home  until  they  became  self-sufficient.  (Tr.  at  26-27,  35-75,  91-101,  120-121,
125-136; GE 1; AE N).
From  approximately  late  2013  to  November  2014,  Applicant  faced  issues  with
her  then-employer  of  nearly  seven  years,  which  in  turn  affected  her  health.  She  also
experienced  issues  involving  her  children  from  2014  through  2018,  to  include  three
incidents  in  which  one  child  was  assaulted  by  school  bullies  and  led  to  her  pursuit  of
criminal charges against the assailants, and behavioral incidents for her other child that
led to an ADHD diagnosis and the implementation of a reasonable accommodation plan
at  that  child’s  school.  She  testified  that  she  notified  both  the  IRS  and  the  state  tax
authority about her circumstances that impeded her ability to timely file her income tax
returns  and  of  her  intention  to  eventually  file  them.  (Tr.  at  26-27,  35-75,  91-101,  125-
136, 148-155; GE 1; AE O, P, Q, R, S).
Applicant testified that at different times during this period:
When I would try to sit down at different times, I would try to work on my
taxes, the weight of everything and knowing the importance of getting the
taxes  done,  but  knowing  everything  that  I  had  to  look  through  and  all  of
the  paperwork,  it  just  was  making  me  get  --  I  would  start  getting  really
anxious. And I couldn’t really, like, be still to do what I needed to do, even
though I knew I needed to do it. And I was getting, like, really, most of the
times, a lot of the times, these crying spells. I would have, like, when I felt
really overwhelmed, I’d just go off somewhere and just really be crying . . .
I  kind  of  feel  like  I  was  fighting  depression,  but  I  never  really  went  to  a
doctor or anything like that, to get diagnosed with depression.
(Tr. at 73).
While Applicant asked her husband for help, his efforts were also stymied by his
struggle, then, with depression. Though she understood she had a legal obligation to file
her  tax  returns,  she  did  not  prioritize  doing  so,  in  part  because  of  her  perception  that
she did not believe she would owe any taxes and she was “basically holding up my own
refund.” She also testified that she did not think about the impact that failing to file her
tax  returns  would  have  on  her  security  clearance.  In  her  SCA,  she  listed  that  she
traveled for pleasure to the Bahamas in December 2014 and to the Dominican Republic
in November 2015. (Tr. at 73, 93-120, 125-136; GE 1).
Applicant  filed  her  2012  through  2017  state  and  federal  income  tax  returns  in
January  2019.  She  hired  a  tax  advisor  in  February  2018  to  assist  her,  though  she
personally sorted through “seven to ten boxes” of paperwork to support the exemptions
and  deductions  that  both  she  and  her  husband  claimed  for  their  home  office.  She
acknowledged  that  her 2017 SCA  prompted  her to  file her relevant  tax  returns.  (Tr. at
22-35, 68, 93-120; GE 1; AE A-F, H, J, V, W, X, Z).
IRS account transcripts from March 2019 reflect that she has a zero balance for
tax periods 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017. An April 2019 letter from the IRS reflects
receipt of her federal income tax return for tax year 2014, but necessary documentation
that was missing needed to be received before her return was processed.  (Tr. at 22-35,
68, 93-120; GE 1; AE A-E, H, V, W, Z).
Applicant testified that when the state tax authority filed her 2012 and 2013 state
income tax returns on her behalf in 2016, after she had failed to timely file them, the tax
authority  gave  her  the  option  of  paying  her  outstanding  state  taxes  of  approximately
$8,000 to $9,000 in full or through a payment plan. She elected the payment plan and
began  payments  accordingly  in  December 2016.  In  approximately  late  2018,  the  state
tax  authority  notified  her  that  it  had  also  filed  her  2014  and  2015  state  income  tax
returns on her behalf after she failed to timely file them and tacked on her outstanding
state taxes for these tax years to her existing payment plan. (Tr. at 22-35, 68, 93-120;
GE 3; AE D, F, G, I, J, W, Y, Z).
A  January  2018  state  tax  authority  record  reflects  that  Applicant’s  outstanding
balance for tax years 2012 and 2013 was $6,230; she established a monthly payment
plan in July 2017 of $235 for 36 months; her first installment was due in August 2017;
and she was in good standing. January 2019 records from the state tax authority reflect
that Applicant has no outstanding state tax income liability after her filed returns for tax
years 2012 through 2017 were processed. The records state that such a determination
could  be  subject  to  change  if  the  IRS  made  any  adjustments  that  would,  in  turn,
necessitate adjustments to her state income tax returns.  (Tr. at 22-35, 68, 93-120; GE
3; AE D, F, G, I, J, W, Y, Z).
Applicant received an extension of time to file her 2018 federal and state income
tax  returns  and  she  filed  them  on  April  17,  2019.  She  testified  that  prior  to  tax  year
2012, she timely filed all of her federal and state income tax returns. She described her
current financial health as “pretty good.” She stated that her husband recently changed
employers  in  October  2018,  but  he  previously  worked  for  the  same  employer  since
2015, and his salary was approaching the amount he earned prior to 2013; he was also
completing his courses towards his bachelor’s degree in May 2019. She also stated that
their  household  annual  salary  was  approximately  $200,000,  they  have  $6,200  in
savings,  $140,000  in  equity  in  their  home,  and  they  intend  to  resume  setting  aside
money  in  their  401(k)  retirement  accounts.  They  do  not  have  any  other  delinquent
debts. They have not sought financial counseling, but they received tax assistance from
their tax advisor. (Tr. at 71, 75-85, 121-136; AE K, L, M, Z).
Applicant’s  U.S.  Government  supervisor  from  January  2017  to  the  date  of  the
hearing testified that he interacted with her daily. He testified that she told him about her
tax issues in late 2018 and he considered them a “blip within her career.” He described
her  as  a  straightforward,  astute,  and  trustworthy  individual  who  observes  rules  and
exercises  good  judgment.  He  testified  that  “she  really  keeps  us  between  the  lines  on
financial issues” and adheres to government finance regulations. He has provided input
to her contract supervisor that he considers her an excellent employee. (Tr. at 136-148).
A friend, who previously  worked  with Applicant from 2012 to 2014, testified that
she  was  aware  of  the  issues  Applicant  faced  with  their  previous  employer,  and  her
accompanying  health  issues.  The  witness  also  testified  that  she  was  aware  of
Applicant’s  tax  issues.  She  described  Applicant  as  a  dedicated  worker  and  a  reliable,
law abiding individual with sound judgment. This witness testified that she was aware of
Applicant’s tax issues. (Tr. at 148-155).
Applicant was selected as “Staff of the Month” in 2009 for her outstanding work.
Her  performance  appraisals  from  2010  through  2014  reflect  that  she  was  a  highly-
regarded employee. She received a commendation in 2016 from an employer for whom
she was on a one-year contract. Her employer noted in her 2017 to 2018 performance
review that she has continued to demonstrate exemplary work performance. (Tr. at 59-
63; AE T, U).
