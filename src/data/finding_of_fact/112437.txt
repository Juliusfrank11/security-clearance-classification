Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c, 1.e, 1.g, 1.m,
1.o, and 1.q. He denied the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f, 1.h through 1.l, 1.n, and 1.p.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 44 years old. He earned an associate’s degree and recently started
working on a bachelor’s degree. He has never been married. He has four children. He
has twins who are 22 years old from a former relationship. He has two children ages 11
and 9-years-old from a former relationship who live with their mother. Applicant has been
employed by a federal contractor since August 2016. He has been consistently employed
and has not disclosed periods of unemployment.2
Applicant  was  previously  employed  by  a  state  agency  from  August  2015  until
August 2016. In January 2016, he was involved in a serious car accident while working.
He did not collect unemployment benefits. He testified he did not receive any pay after
the accident. He filed a claim for worker’s compensation. During this time, he fell behind
on his child support payments.3
Applicant testified he had to take his employer to court to receive compensation
for  his  accident.  He  provided  a  copy  of  a  settlement  agreement  with  his  employer
administered  through  the  compensation  claims  division  of  the  state.  The  settlement
agreement  stated  that  it  was  a  complete  and  final  release,  and  waiver  of  all  medical
benefits which Applicant might be entitled from his former employer. The employer agreed
to pay a lump sum of $7,500, inclusive of attorney’s fees and costs. It noted that Applicant
understood that this payment would settle his entitlement to all classifications of medical
benefits.  It  highlighted  that  the  settlement  specifically included any  and  all  outstanding
medical  bills,  either  currently  known  or  unknown  to  the parties,  as  well  as  outstanding
medical bills owed to various entities that provided medical services incurred by Applicant
as result of the accident. The agreement stated that Applicant agreed that he will be solely
responsible for payment of such bills and holds the employer harmless from any liability.
The indemnity portion of the claim was previously settled. Out of the $7,500, Applicant
1  Hearing  Exhibit  (HE)  I  is  the  exhibit  list  and  II  is  the  discovery  letter.  HE  II  is  the  exhibit  list.  HE  III  is

was  to  pay  his  attorney  $1,250  and  other  court  fees.  His  net  recovery  was  $6,181.
Applicant signed the agreement before a notary on July 28, 2018.4
Applicant stated that the medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.n
were to be paid by his employer. He explained that when his accident occurred he learned
that the contract for medical insurance had lapsed and the state would pay only $10,000
for  his  medical  debts. He  testified that  his  attorney  told  him  his  medical  bills  would  be
paid. He said he believed his medical bills were covered by worker’s compensation. He
used some of his settlement payment to pay child support.5
Applicant disputed the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.m on his October
2018 credit report. He testified he hired a law firm to dispute his debts. The credit report
confirms that these accounts are being disputed. No determination was made as to the
validity of the debts. Applicant testified that he paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.m ($329). I find
in his favor on these debts. He testified that he paid the debt in SOR 1.p ($200) and would
provide documentation. He did not. This debt is not resolved.6
Applicant testified that he no longer has to pay child support as of March 2017 for
his twin children. He said he is paying the arrearages owed (SOR ¶1.a-$15,065). He said
he was paying $1,000 a month toward the amount owed. He provided a document that
shows he made payments of $244 twice in September 2018, four payments of $244 in
October 2018, and a payment of $244 in November 2018. The document shows that as
of November 2018, the total arrears owed is $5,466. His intention was to complete paying
this arrearage and then begin paying the arrearages for his other two children (SOR ¶
1.c-$12,313) and make the full payments. He provided a document from the state where
they reside that shows the current balance of his arrearage is $16,822. The document
showed he made $200 payments in April, May, June, August, September, and February
2017. In March 2017, he made two payments of $200 and one payment of $1,360. The
child support order requires him to pay $660 a month. He understands that each month
he  is  deficient  in  amount  of  his  payments.  Applicant  testified  when  he  received  his
settlement payment, he paid about $5,000 toward child support.7
Applicant provided a document to show he made a payment of $107 in May 2018
for  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.q  ($249).  There  is  still  a  balance  owed.  He  also  provided  a
payment receipt showing that he made a $50 and $23 payment on the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e.
The account lists a remaining balance of $281. These debts are not resolved.8

settlement.

In Applicant’s October 2017 background investigation, he disclosed he purchased
a  vehicle  in  about  2011  and  then  could not afford the  payments.9  He  testified  that  the
vehicle was repossessed (SOR ¶ 1.b-$13,013) in 2014. He told the investigator that once
he caught up on child support payments, he would pay $20 a month on the repossessed
vehicle. He testified that he contacted the creditor in August 2018 to see if the balance
could  be  reduced.  They  did  not  respond.  He  has  not  contacted  the  creditor  again.  He
intends to pay the debt in the future. The debt is not resolved.10
Applicant acknowledged the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g was for an apartment in which he
lived with the mother of his younger children in about 2013 or 2014. When they separated,
he  broke  the  lease.  During  his  background  investigation,  he  told  the  government
investigator that he would begin paying $35 a month within 30 days to resolve the debt.
He  testified  that he does  not  have  the  resources  to  pay  this  debt at  this time,  but  had
contacted the creditor and advised them he would pay it. He admits the debt in SOR ¶
1.o has been delinquent since about 2015, and was not paid.11 The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.g
and 1.o are unresolved.
The  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  are  corroborated  by  Applicant’s  admissions,
documents, and credit reports from September 2017 and October 2018.12
Applicant testified that he is attending school so he can get a better job and earn
more money. He has approximately $41,000 in student loans that are deferred. He began
incurring the student loans in 2008.13
