In  Applicant’s  answer,  he  admitted  the  allegation  in  the  SOR.  I  adopt  his
admission as a finding of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and
exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  40  years  old.  He  is  married  with  one  child.  He  has  worked  for  his
current  employer,  a  federal  contractor,  since  April  2007.  He  attended  college  for
approximately three years, but did not receive a degree.1
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  used  marijuana,  with  varying  frequency  from
approximately  June  1998  to  April  2017.  In  October  2017,  he  admitted  to  a  defense
investigator that he used marijuana about once every three months from June 1998 to
January  2017  (which  post-dated  the  completion  of  his  SCA).  He  further  described  his
use  of  marijuana  as  using  it  with  friends  or  family  in  their  homes.  He  claims  to  have
stopped his use when his wife became pregnant (no date in the record for this event).
He  further  claims  he  will  not  use  marijuana  in  the  future.  In  April  2018,  when  he
completed interrogatories sent to him concerning this case, he was unable to recall the
dates of his use of marijuana. His employer has a workplace drug policy that comports
with  the  “Drug-Free  Work  Force  rules  issued  by  the  DOD.”  Since  Applicant  submitted
this  case  for  an  administrative  determination,  I  was  not  able  to  judge  his  credibility
based on demeanor.2
