In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.k,
and 1.v. (HE 3) Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  56-year-old  pilot  and  maintenance  specialist for  unmanned  aerial
vehicles (aircraft piloted by remote control or onboard computers) and drones. (Tr. 7-8,
25)  He  has  worked  for  the  same  government  contractor  since  July  2014.  (Tr.  25)  He
served in the Air Force for almost 28 years, and he honorably retired from the Air Force
Reserve in 2008 as a master sergeant. (Tr. 8, 28) He served in Panama in Operation Just
Cause,  in  Southwest  Asia  in  Desert  Shield/Desert  Storm,  in  Kosovo,  Iraq,  and
Afghanistan. (Tr. 8-9) His most recent deployments have been to Iraq and Africa. (Tr. 26)
In  1981,  Applicant  graduated  from  high  school,  and  in  2003,  he  received  a
bachelor’s  degree  in  management.  (Tr.  7-8)  In  1997,  he  married,  and  in  2014,  he
divorced. (Tr. 9-10) His children are ages 12 and 14. (Tr. 10)
Financial Considerations
Applicant attributed his financial problems to his spouse’s failure to maintain his
finances while he was deployed overseas. (Tr. 19) She used illegal drugs. (Tr. 38) She
failed to make payments on two houses, and they were lost to foreclosure. (Tr. 38) After
they divorced in 2014, Applicant’s spouse did not pay her share of marital debts. Around
the time of his divorce, he owed his brother $50,000 “and some other people.” (Tr. 29)
Applicant  was  deployed  in  2015  when  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  started
garnishing  his  pay,  and that  is  when he first  learned he  had problems  with  his federal
income taxes. (Tr. 74) Applicant has been in the United States without being deployed
overseas since March 2017. (Tr. 26) He was injured during his last deployment. (Tr. 26)
His  current  annual  salary  is  about  $105,000.  (Tr.  27)  He  has  custody  of  his  children;
however, he does not receive any child support from his former spouse. (Tr. 29-30)
From May 2011 to May 2015, Applicant was not deployed, except for some brief
trips overseas. (Tr. 91) He was employed in fracking for almost two years in the United
States. (Tr. 31, 91) He was mostly deployed from May 2015 to March 2017. (Tr. 92)
Applicant’s SOR alleges the following financial issues:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a mortgage account that went to foreclosure and resulted in a
deficiency balance of $21,525. Applicant said he was overseas when his residence and
a  rental  property  were  foreclosed.  He  denied  that  he  owed  anything,  and  he  said  he
received a letter from the creditor indicating he did not owe the debt. (Tr. 40) Applicant’s
March  6,  2018  Equifax  credit  report  shows  the  $21,525  as  a  “past  due”  amount;  the
account became delinquent in 2012; and the property was sold. (GE 3) His December 31,
2018 Equifax credit report does not list this debt. (GE 2)
SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.f  allege  delinquent  utility  accounts  for  $1,671  and  $551.
Applicant said his wife paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.f around 2010 or 2011. (Tr.
41-42, 48-49)
SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.l , 1.s, 1.t, and 1.u, allege eight medical debts placed
for collection for $1,125, $969, $759, $480, $81, $2,715, $917, and $711. SOR ¶¶ 1.k
and  1.v  allege  delinquent  medical  debts  for  $84  and  $93.  Over  the  last  five  years,
Applicant  has  received  some  medical  treatments.  Around  2015,  he  was  taken  by
ambulance to a hospital for emergency treatment. (Tr. 43) He did not have documentation
on the ten medical SOR debts, or if he did, he did not provide it. When he contacted the
medical providers, they were unable to locate supporting documentation. (Tr. 45, 51, 68-
69) He wanted to determine whether the bills were for himself or his former spouse. (Tr.
45-47,  58-59)  He  had  medical  insurance,  and  he  wanted  to  determine  whether  the
medical bills were his responsibility or the responsibility of his insurance. (Tr. 46-47, 58)
He believed he paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.l and 1.v for $81 and $93; however, he was
unable  to  obtain  documentation  showing  payment.  (Tr.  59,  69)  Applicant  accepted
responsibility for the medical  debt  in  SOR ¶  1.s for  $2,715,  and  the creditor offered  to
settle the debt for $735. (Tr. 66-67) He was waiting for the creditor for SOR ¶ 1.s to send
him a settlement bill. (Tr. 67)  None of the 10 medical debts were shown on his December
31, 2018 Equifax credit report. (Tr. 48; GE 2) Applicant is credited with resolving all of the
medical debts except for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.s, which he admitted was unresolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.m allege miscellaneous delinquent debts for $295, $245,
$205, and $3,415. Applicant said he successfully disputed the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h. (Tr. 52-
54)  He  did  not  think  the  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.i  and  1.j  were  legitimate  debts,  and  he
contacted the original creditors. (Tr. 55-57) He did not understand why the debts in SOR
¶¶ 1.i and 1.j were on his credit report. (Tr. 55-57) Applicant said he did not owe the debt
in  SOR  ¶  1.m  because  his  former  spouse  improperly  opened  the  account  without  his
permission. (Tr. 60) He said the creditor for SOR ¶ 1.m is pursuing his former spouse for
payment of the debt. (Tr. 61)
SOR ¶ 1.p alleges a mortgage account was foreclosed in 2011. Applicant said the
foreclosure was actually in 2012. (Tr. 61) His spouse received a check from the creditor
for  $3,800.  (Tr.  62)  He  blamed  his  spouse  for  not  paying  the  mortgage  while  he  was
deployed.  (Tr.  63-64)  He  believed  the  creditor  owed  him  money  from  the  sale  of  his
residence. (Tr. 63)
SOR ¶¶ 1.q, and 1.r allege two bank debts owed to the same bank, which were
placed for collection for $8,624 and $4,577. Applicant contacted the creditor and learned
there  were  two  accounts;  however,  he  believed  one  of  them  was  his  spouse’s
responsibility. (Tr. 64-65) He believed the smaller debt was his responsibility. (Tr. 65) He
did not provide any evidence of payments to address either debt. (Tr. 66)
SOR ¶ 1.w alleges a charged-off bank debt for $17,797. Applicant contacted the
creditor, and in December 2018, the creditor offered to settle the debt for $8,000. (Tr. 70-
71) Applicant accepted the settlement offer; however, he wanted to resolve the IRS debt
first. (Tr. 72)
SOR ¶ 1.x alleges a federal tax lien filed in November 2014 for $20,711. Applicant
said his spouse lied to him about filing their tax returns for tax years 2007 to 2014. (Tr.
19, 31, 73) She had a power of attorney. (Tr. 73) Applicant was “taking home $16,000 a
month”  while  he  was  deployed overseas.  (Tr.  73) He  deployed  overseas, and the IRS
began garnishing his pay. (Tr. 31) After he learned about his tax problems, he hired a tax
company to work on his taxes. (Tr. 31) The tax company lost his documentation, and in
2016, he stopped working with the tax company that lost his documentation. (Tr. 31, 76)
In April 2018, Applicant sought the assistance of an expert in tax-exempt status
and  contractor taxes. (Tr.  19, 32,  38)  He believed  the  IRS owed  him  refunds  because
some of his income overseas was tax exempt. (Tr. 32) The expert was unable to timely
complete his tax returns because Applicant’s documentation was in storage. (Tr. 33) He
described his tax situation as a “big mess” and asserted he is contacting his creditors to
“clear everything up.” (Tr. 20, 34)
Applicant intended to file or refile his federal income tax returns for 2007 to 2014,
and he plans to file his tax returns for 2015, 2016, and 2017. (Tr. 35-36, 79) He filed tax
returns for tax years 2007 to 2014 in the beginning of 2016. (Tr. 80) He also filed a tax
return in 2015 for tax year 2014. (Tr. 79) He was reluctant to file his tax returns for tax
years  2015,  2016,  and  2017  because  the  IRS  might  take  his  refunds  to  address  the
$20,000  debt  that  Applicant  believed  was  erroneous.  (Tr.  37)  He  believed  the  IRS
erroneously believed he made a profit on his home that was foreclosed. (Tr. 81) He said
the IRS owed him $100,000 to $120,000. (Tr. 79) He wanted to file everything together.
(Tr. 38, 75)
I requested that Applicant provide the following documents: his IRS tax account
transcripts;1 his DD Form 214; the IRS power of attorney he gave to his spouse to file his
tax returns without his knowledge; proof of any payments, payment plans, or settlement
negotiations relating to any SOR creditors; and a recent credit report from the three major
credit reporting companies. (Tr. 93-94) I explained that he could also provide performance
evaluations,  awards,  letters  of  recommendation,  and  any  other  documentation  that  he
believed would help him obtain reinstatement of his security clearance. (Tr. 96)
Personal Conduct
Applicant’s May 11, 2016 SCA asked about his delinquent debts including debts
in collections and charged-off debts in the previous seven years. Applicant denied that he
had debts meeting this criteria; however, in the comments sections of his SCA he said
his spouse “did not pay bills, caused all financial issues to include foreclosure, bad debts,
not  paying  income  taxes  or  filing  income  taxes  for  many  years.  I  have  taken  steps  to
resolve all the financial issues and clear my bad credit.” (GE 1 at 33-34) He disclosed his
delinquent tax  debt of  $21,000, for  tax  year  2014,  and  he  said  it was  satisfied  in April
2016. (Tr. 89; GE 1 at 30) He said, “I have filed and [am] paying installments to correct
the issue currently. I have an install[ment] agreement with the IRS and [am] completing
them currently.” (GE 1 at 30) He said he was unaware of his delinquent debts when he
completed  his  May  11,  2016  SCA.  (Tr.  83)  He  had  difficulty  completing  the  security
clearance application while deployed overseas due, in part, to problems with the Internet
and saving the document. (Tr. 84)
During Applicant’s June 1, 2017 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal
subject interview (PSI), Applicant volunteered that his spouse failed to file and pay their
federal income taxes in the amount of $21,000 for tax year 2014. (Tr. 92) He said he was
making monthly payments to the IRS of $428, and his payments would be complete in
two  months.  (Tr.  92;  GE  7  at  6-7)  He  was  unable  to  provide  the  status  of  numerous
delinquent debts the OPM investigator asked him about during this PSI. (GE 7)
1 An Applicant’s failure to provide requested, available tax documentation, including IRS-generated
federal income tax transcripts, can undermine mitigation of tax debts. See ISCR Case No. 16-02322 at 4
(App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2018).
