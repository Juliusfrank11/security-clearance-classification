Applicant  admitted  all  the  Guideline  F  allegations  (except  ¶  1.e,  which  was
neither admitted nor denied) and those admissions are incorporated into these findings
of  fact.  He  denied  the  Guideline  E  allegation.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He began working
at his present job in October 2016. He served in the Air Force from 2001 until 2003 as a
security  forces  airmen  (military  police)  when  he  was  discharged  under  other  than
honorable conditions (UOTHC). He held a security clearance before his discharge. His
discharge was so characterized because he received Article 15 UCMJ punishment from
his  commander  for  having  an  adulterous  affair  with  the  spouse  of  another  military
member. He has a high school diploma and has completed several college (technical)
courses  resulting  in  him  receiving  information  technology  (IT)  certifications.  He  is
married (since 2001) and has one son, age 17.2
The  SOR  (and  subsequent  amendment)  alleged  three  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately $2,624 (no amount was alleged for SOR ¶ 1.d). The debts were listed in
credit reports from February 2017 and March 2019 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b – 1.e). The SOR also
alleged  Applicant  failed  to  file  his  federal  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2014-2016.  It  was
further  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately  failed  to  list  his  2015  marijuana  use  when
asked  if  he  had  used  any  illegal  drug  or  controlled  substance  within  the  past  seven
years on his December 5, 2016 security clearance application (SCA). He stated “no” to
the question on his SCA. (SOR ¶ 2.a).3

Applicant‘s financial difficulties began in approximately 2013. His wife worked as
the family’s sole means of financial support. Applicant remained at home caring for their
son  who  has  emotional  and  social  issues  that  manifest  in  behavioral  problems.
Applicant’s  wife  worked
industry  and  made
approximately $30 per hour. In late 2013 and early 2014, Applicant’s wife suffered from
medical issues that restricted her ability to work and caused her to use Family Medical
Leave  in  February  2014.  She  was  unable  to  return  to  work  until  August  2015.  She
received six weeks’ worth of short-term disability pay in 2014. Applicant began working
at  a  convenience  store  to  assist  with  the  family  finances.  He  attended  school  at  night
seeking  certifications  in  the  IT  field.  In  2015  he  was  hired  in  an  IT  position.  They
accrued medical debts during Applicant’s wife’s period of illness. Those debts were not
specifically identified in the record.4

The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.b (consumer debt)-$548. Applicant presented documentation showing
that this debt was settled in full in April 2019. This debt is resolved.5
SOR  ¶  1.c  (medical  debt)-$860.  Applicant  incurred  this  medical  debt  from  a
motorcycle accident he was in. He presented documentation showing that this debt was
paid in February 2016. This debt is resolved.6
SOR  ¶  1.d  (consumer  debt).  Applicant  incurred  this  debt  in  the  amount  of
approximately  $1,000  for  a  gaming  computer.  In  April  2019,  he  arranged  to  have  $50
monthly payments made from his bank account by electronic funds transfers (EFT) for
21 months to pay this debt. This debt is being resolved.7
SOR ¶ 1.e (college course debt)-$1,216. Applicant incurred this debt  when he
enrolled in a course that his employer agreed to pay for on the condition that Applicant
achieved at least a “B” grade in the course. He failed to achieve a “B” and was required
to  pay  for  the  course  himself.  He  negotiated  a  settlement  with  the  creditor,  which  has
him making a $611 payment on April 30, 2019, and a $300 payment on May 30, 2019.
No proof of payment was submitted. This debt is being resolved.8
Applicant claimed that the reason he did not timely file his 2014-2016 tax returns
was because his brother-in-law, who is not a tax professional, told him that if he is due a
refund,  he  did  not  have  to  file  his  tax  returns  by  the  April  15  annual  deadline.

Additionally,  his  wife  had  prepared  their  tax  returns  in  the  past  and  because  of  her
health issues and her job situation, she was overwhelmed and the tax returns for 2014-
2016  were  not  timely  filed.  In  2018,  a  friend  helped  prepare  their  missing  tax  returns
using tax preparation software. The 2014 tax return shows no filing date, but Applicant
testified that it was filed in April 2018. The 2015 tax return was filed March 2, 2018 and
the  2016  tax  return  was  filed  April  2,  2018.  Applicant  also  stated  that  their  2017  tax
return was timely filed in April 2018. 9
In  Section  23  of  his  December  5,  2016  SCA,  Applicant  was  asked,  “In  the  last
seven years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled substance?” He responded
by  checking  the  “No”  option.  In  September 2017,  when  interviewed  by  an  investigator
during  his  background  check,  Applicant  was  again  asked  if  he  used  any  drugs  or
controlled  substances  in  the  last  seven  years.  He  responded  with  a  “No”  answer.  He
was  then  asked  again  by  the  investigator  if  he  had  ever  used  illegal  drugs.  Applicant
responded by asking if the investigator meant “ever?” The investigator clarified that he
meant had Applicant used illegal drugs in the past seven years. Applicant responded to
this question with an affirmative response and explained that he had used marijuana in
December 2015 when a friend gave him a small amount.10
Applicant  claimed  during  his  hearing  testimony  that  when  he  answered  the
question in his SCA that he had “a lot going on with my family and my personal life.” He
also claimed he misunderstood the question and thought it was asking if he used illegal
drugs  as  a  manager  or  supervisor.  He  then  claimed  he  came  forward  during  his
background  investigation  and  admitted  his  use  of  marijuana  in  December  2015.  He
failed to mention that he initially denied such use to the investigator and it was only after
the  investigator  repeated  the  question  and  clarified  it  that  Applicant  admitted  to  the
marijuana use. I found Applicant’s testimony to be not credible.11
