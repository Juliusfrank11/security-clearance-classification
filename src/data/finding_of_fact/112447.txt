Under  Guideline  F,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant  owed  $21,901  for  16
delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a – 1.p). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted
only SOR 1.d, and he denied the rest. In his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed the debts alleged
at SOR 1.a – 1.c, 1.g, and 1.i. The remaining debts are documented in three credit reports
obtained during Applicant’s background investigation and the adjudication of this case.
(Answer; GX 1 – 4) In addition to the facts thus established, I make the following additional
findings of fact.
Applicant is 29 years old. After working in various jobs after high school, he joined
the  Army  in  April  2010.  Applicant  served  on  active  duty,  which  included  a  one-year
deployment to Afghanistan in 2011 and 2012, until receiving an honorable discharge in
October  2013.  Thereafter,  he  served  in  the  Army  Reserve  until  he  was  medically
discharged in February 2014. Except for four months in 2014, Applicant was unemployed
after leaving the Army until he was hired by a defense contractor in July 2015. Applicant
was hired by his current employer in January 2016. Applicant previously held a security
clearance as part of his military duties in the Army Signal Corps. (GX 1; Tr. 6 – 7, 27, 29)
Applicant and his wife have been married since December 2016. They have two
children  under  two  years  of  age,  for  whom  his  wife  cares  as  a  stay-at-home  mom.
Applicant was previously married from June 2010 until a divorce decree was finalized in
August  2014.  The  couple  separated  in  2012,  one  month  after  Applicant  returned  from
Afghanistan. All but two2 of the debts at issue in this case were opened in Applicant’s
name by his ex-wife either while he was overseas or shortly after he returned. She did so
1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.
2 The debt at SOR 1.h was owed to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for overpayment of benefits.
That debt was resolved in February 2018. The debt at SOR 1.m was owed to the Defense Finance and
Accounting  Service  (DFAS)  for  military  equipment  Applicant  had  not  turned  in  when  he  returned  from
deployment. That debt was resolved in June 2016. (AX E; Tr. 38 – 40)
using a general power of attorney he gave her so she could manage their affairs in his
absence.  His  ex-wife  opened  several  accounts  to  buy  things  they  could  not  afford,
including  a  houseful  of  furniture,  two  cars,  and  even  orthodontic  braces.  None  of  the
accounts was paid as required during his absence. Applicant had no knowledge of her
malfeasance until he returned. Even after they separated, she was able to abuse their
finances by writing checks from their bank account and purchasing a second car. His ex-
wife’s conduct ended when Applicant closed their joint bank account. (GX 1 – 4; Tr. 26 –
27, 41)
Despite  his  ex-wife’s  misconduct,  Applicant  has  accepted  responsibility  for  the
debts because it was he who gave her power of attorney in the first place. In May 2016,
after nearly a year of steady employment with a defense contractor, Applicant obtained
the  services  of  a  debt  management  firm  (DMF)  to  negotiate  with  his  creditors  and
establish  a  monthly  repayment  plan  that  would  resolve  most  or  all  of  his  outstanding
debts. Initially, debt payments were delayed by about seven months because DMF was
unable to implement automatic withdrawals from either of Applicant’s two bank accounts.
When Applicant submitted his e-QIP, he was paying $700 each month to pay the debts
at  SOR  1.a,  1.b,  1.c,  1.e,  and  1.f.  To  date,  only  SOR  1.a  remains  unresolved,  but  his
current monthly payment of $483 is now being directed to pay that debt. (GX 1; AX B; AX
E; Tr. 44 – 45)
Applicant successfully resolved the debts at SOR 1.g and 1.j after proving to those
creditors that his ex-wife had misused his identity. In those instances, she had used his
social  security  number  but  with  her  name  on  the  accounts.  Applicant  resolved  the
remaining debts listed in the SOR by paying those creditors directly. (AX C – E; Tr. 31 –
41)
Applicant’s current finances are sound. He has only two credit cards, which as of
the  hearing,  had  a  combined  balance  due  under  $700.  He  currently  earns  $81,000
annually  and  has  no  other  outstanding  debts.  Applicant  files  and  pays  his  taxes  as
required,  has  a  good  command  of  his  personal  finances,  and  appears  to  be  living
modestly and within his means. (AX A; Tr. 28 – 30, 41, 46)
