Applicant is 43 years old and works as a defense contractor. He served in the U.S.
Navy for 20 years and was honorably discharged in June 2014 at the pay grade of E-6.
He worked primarily as a machinist and “contractor engineer.” He has been married twice,
once in 1994 and again in 2017. His first marriage ended in divorce in January 2005. He
has three children, two of whom are adults and one is a minor. He pays child support to
the mother of the minor child. He also has two stepchildren as a result of his remarriage.
(Tr. 22, 23, 47.)
Applicant received his high school diploma in 1994 or 1995, and has been taking
college courses to earn an associate’s degree in automotive technology. He also hopes
to earn a bachelor’s degree in business. (Tr. 7, 21.)
Following his honorable discharge from the Navy in 2014, Applicant obtained a job
with  a  defense  contractor  in  another  state.  He  is  currently  employed  with  a  successor
company. At his own expense, he moved to the area where his new employment was
located. The new area has a higher cost of living, which has strained Applicant’s financial
situation.  He  is  also  still  recovering  from  certain  expenses  associated  with  his  2005
divorce. (Tr. 24, 25.)
While in the Navy, Applicant held a security clearance. On October 25, 2011, the
Department of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility granted Applicant a secret clearance
with a condition that he seek financial counseling for assistance in resolving his delinquent
debts. Applicant failed to provide this information in his SCA. A 2011 credit report reflected
that Applicant  had  several delinquent debts  and a  vehicle  repossession  and auto  loan
deficiency at that time. He testified that he was never advised about the conditional nature
of his clearance, and he did not seek financial counseling at that time. He testified further
that his debts in 2011 were the result of his 2005 divorce. (GE 2; GE 4; Tr. 15, 24.)
On June 20, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) in
connection with his new employment with a defense contractor. He disclosed a tax debt
in his SCA, which he subsequently paid through a garnishment. That debt was not alleged

in the SOR. He failed to disclose the debts alleged in the SOR because he claims he was
unaware of them at the time he prepared his SCA. (GE 2; Tr. 4.)
to
information
Applicant  provided
income  and  expense
the  background
investigator,  which  showed  that  he  had  a  $4,000  monthly  surplus.  At  the  time  of  the
hearing, his monthly financial situation was still stable, though his wife was contributing
less  income  from  her  part-time  employment  and  his  monthly  rent  had  increased  from
$1,275 to $2,500 after moving his new family in March 2017. (Tr. 54; GE 3 at 8.) In his
SOR Answer, Applicant wrote that he was working with a financial counselor to resolve
his debts with the debt collectors. He testified that he had received financial counseling
from his tax preparer. He claimed that this person helped him contact one or more of his
creditors for the purpose of seeking to resolve his debts and has helped him prepare a
budget.  Applicant  was  unable  to  recall  her  name  at  the  hearing,  and  he  provided  no
additional information or documentation after the hearing. (SOR Answer at 1; AE 3 at 8-
9; Tr. 32-33, 42, 45-46, 53.)
The SOR alleges seven delinquent debts totaling about $38,000. Applicant’s most
significant debts arose in 2016 and 2017 while he was employed as a contractor and was
receiving retirement and disability pay from the Navy. One small credit-card debt arose in
2011 and two minor debts arose  in 2014 and 2015 after he retired from the Navy and
relocated for his new employment.
SOR ¶¶ 1.a: rental expense in collection with a balance of $986. In June 2016,
Applicant was evicted from an apartment he shared with his future second wife and her
child  after  a  disruptive  incident  involving  the  woman  and  the  child.  Applicant  was  not
present at the time of the incident. According to his testimony, Applicant paid the creditor
$500  towards  this  debt  in  October  2018,  one  month  before  the  hearing.  (Tr.  28.)  On
December 3, 2018, three weeks after the hearing, he paid the balance due of $780. He
provided  evidence  of  the  second  payment.  (AE  B.)  Applicant  has  resolved  this  debt,
though he paid it well after his receipt of the SOR.
SOR  ¶  1.b:  credit  card  account  in  collection  with  a  balance  of  $1,416.
Applicant took out this credit card while in the Navy. He defaulted on the account in 2017.
(GE 5 at 3.) He agreed to pay the debt through a voluntary, automatic deduction of $220
from his Navy retirement account. (GE 3 at 5; Tr. 28-29.) He has paid this debt, and he
now has a credit on the account of $342. (AE C.) This debt is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c: vehicle loan charged off for $26,058. Applicant’s ex-wife opened this
account in April 2011 in Applicant’s name using a power of attorney that she held. She
did this without his knowledge. Shortly thereafter, he found out about her unauthorized
actions. He did not dispute the $24,000 loan, however, because he was trying to get back
together with her at that time, some six years after they had divorced. At that time he was
paying his ex-wife $1,200 of monthly child support, and she was using that money to pay
the  $700  per-month  vehicle  loan  payment.  For  a  reason  unknown  to  Applicant,  she
stopped paying on the loan in 2016, and the bank charged off the loan in December 2016
after  repossessing  the  truck.  At  the  time  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  had  been  unable  to
resolve this debt because the creditor wanted a large, lump-sum payment, which he could
not afford. He testified that the creditor did not want to work with him on a payment plan.
He last contacted the creditor in September 2018, and he was waiting for the creditor to
respond. After the hearing, he advised in an email that he had set up with the creditor an
automatic payment of $400 per month out of his retirement pay starting in January 2019.
Neither Applicant’s offer of a payment plan nor the creditor’s acceptance of the plan has
been documented, and no payments have been made as of the close of the record. (Tr.
30-33, 50-51, 56; AE A.) The debt is not yet resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.d: installment loan charged off for $8,595. Applicant borrowed money
to pay for his relocation in 2014 following his retirement from the Navy. He repaid the loan
and took out a second loan in April 2016, basically refinancing the initial loan. At that time,
he had additional expenses to move some personal property he had left in storage in his
prior  residential  area  and  to  pay  rent  that  was  past  due  on  his  prior  residence.  He
defaulted on this installment loan in 2016, and the lender wrote off the loan balance in
November  2016.  In  his  November  2017  background  interview,  Applicant  said  that  two
months earlier, he began paying the creditor $175 per month and the current amount of
the debt was $7,540. He provided no documentation to support this assertion. After the
hearing, he sent me an email in which he wrote that he has increased the payments to
$390 per month from his retirement account, starting in January 2019. (GE 5 at 3; GE 3
at  5; Tr. at 33-38,  52; AE  A.)  It appears that  this debt may  be  in  the process of  being
resolved,  but  Applicant  has  provided  no  documentary  evidence  to  support  that
conclusion.
SOR ¶ 1.e: credit card account charged off for $492. The bank that issued this
credit card charged off this account in July 2011. Applicant admitted this debt in his SOR
response, but at the hearing he testified that he had forgotten about the debt. As of the
hearing, he had not contracted the creditor. He testified that the debt was related to his
2005 divorce. After the hearing, he paid the debt with another credit card, and he provided
the confirmation number because he did not yet have a  corroborating receipt from the
creditor.  (GE  5  at  3;  Tr.  38-39;  AE  A.)  It  appears  that  this  credit-card  debt  has  been
resolved with a payment using another credit card.
SOR ¶¶ 1.f, and 1.g: delinquent auto insurance and utility bills in collection
with a total balance of $169. These accounts have been in collection since 2015 and
2014, respectively. After the hearing, Applicant provided evidence of his payment of the
insurance bill. (AE D.) Applicant provided no information regarding the utility debt in the
amount of $52, though he testified that he would pay it off by the end of November 2018.
(Tr. 40.) The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f is resolved; the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g is not.
