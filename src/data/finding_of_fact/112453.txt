Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since 2016. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 2002
until  he  was  honorably  discharged  in  2011.  He  seeks  to  retain  a  security  clearance,
which he has held since he was in the military. He has a bachelor’s degree, awarded in
2016, and  he attended graduate school  in  pursuit of a master’s degree. He has never
married,  but  he  and  his  fiancé  have  cohabitated  since  about  2008.  He  does  not  have
children.1
Applicant had a difficult childhood. His father was not in his life, but he was raised
by  his  mother  and  stepfather,  who  he  refers  to  as  his  father.  His  parents  smoked
marijuana.  His  stepfather  sold  marijuana  and  occasionally  cocaine.  Applicant  started
smoking  marijuana  when  he  was  about  12  or  13  years  old.  He  started  smoking
marijuana with his mother when he was about 16 years old. He completed one year of
college after high school. He worked and occasionally sold marijuana. He came home
one day and found that his home had been burglarized and ransacked. He decided he
needed a change in his life and joined the U.S. military in 2002 at the age of 22.2
Applicant was stationed overseas from 2003 through 2006. He deployed to Iraq
from  October  2003  to  July  2004  and  from  September  2007  to  January  2008.  In  about
December 2004, Applicant was home visiting his mother and stepfather. His stepfather
had  been  diagnosed  with  Alzheimer’s  disease  and  dementia.  His  stepfather  smoked
marijuana  to  help  manage  his  pain.  He  asked  Applicant  to  smoke  marijuana  with  him,
which  Applicant  did  on  one  occasion.  Applicant  again  smoked  marijuana  with  some
friends  about  a  day  later.  He  held  a  top  secret  security  clearance  with  access  to
sensitive  compartmented  information  (SCI)  at  the  time.  His  marijuana  use  was  not
detected by the military.3

Applicant  was  coming  to  terms  with  his  sexuality  when  he  had  his  first
homosexual relationship with a foreign national in about 2004.4 The foreign national was
emotionally and physically abusive to Applicant. The foreign national pushed Applicant
to use cocaine, which he did on about five to six occasions in 2005. He held a top secret
security  clearance  with  access  to  SCI  at  the  time.  These  were  the  only  occasions
Applicant  ever  used  any  illegal  drugs  other  than  marijuana.  His  cocaine  use  went
undetected by the military.5
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
August 2009, while he was still in the military. He did not report any illegal drug use in
the  previous  seven  years,  and  he  did  not  report  his  marijuana  and  cocaine  use  while
holding a security clearance.6
Applicant submitted another SF 86 in November 2014. He answered “no” to the
question  that  asked  if  he  had  ever  illegally  used  a  drug  while  possessing  a  security
clearance.7
Applicant  submitted  a  third  SF  86  in  February  2015.  He  answered  “yes”  to  the
question  that  asked  if  he  had  ever  illegally  used  a  drug  while  possessing  a  security
clearance.  He  reported  marijuana  use  in  May  2005.  He  wrote  that  he  “[s]moke[d]
marijuana once with [his] friends after coming back from deployment . . . .” He did not
report that he used cocaine in 2005 while he held a security clearance.8
Applicant’s  eligibility  for  access  to  SCI  was  denied  by  a  government  agency  in
May  2016.  He  submitted  a  fourth  SF  86  in  July  2017.  He  reported  his  marijuana  and
cocaine use in 2004 to 2005.9 He wrote:
There  will  be  a  discrepancy  in  this  answer  on  my  last  SF86  and  it  is
because I did not notice the question was asking for “EVER” instead of a
time period. I had also forgotten about the incidents because they are over
12  years  old  and  it  wasn’t  until  I  was  undergoing  a  full  scope  polygraph
that I started to remember the incidents.10
4  The  adjudicative  guidelines  specifically  state  that  “[n]o  adverse  inference  concerning  the  standards  in
this  Guideline  may  be  raised  solely  on  the  basis  of  the  sexual  orientation  of  the  individual.”  AG  ¶  12.
Applicant’s sexual orientation is not relevant to a determination of his security worthiness. It is discussed
here solely because Applicant specifically addressed it as part of the reason he “buried” his illegal drug
use and did not remember it when he completed Questionnaires for National Security Positions.

Applicant  denied  intentionally  providing  false  information  on  any  of  the  SF  86s.
He stated that he did not remember the drug use when he filled out the questionnaires.
He stated that he buried the incident with his stepfather “because of what it meant and
how much it hurt to come back after being gone a year.” He stated that he also forgot
about  smoking  marijuana  with  his  friends  because  it  all  happened  on  the  same
weekend,  and  he  “looked  at  it  as  one  situation.”  He  also  buried  the  cocaine  use
because it was associated with an abusive relationship.11
Applicant’s  stepfather  passed  away  in  2010.  At  some  point  after  his  stepfather
passed  away,  Applicant  told  his  fiancé  that  he  smoked  marijuana  with  his  stepfather.
Applicant’s  fiancé  helped  him  fill  out  the  2015  SF  86.  Applicant  stated  that  he  had
forgotten about his marijuana use in 2004. It was his fiancé who reminded him that he
smoked marijuana with his stepfather. He stated that he did not report the cocaine use
on that questionnaire because he did not remember it.12
Applicant’s  fiancé’s  testimony  was  consistent  with  Applicant’s  testimony.  He
helped Applicant fill out the 2015 SF 86. He testified that Applicant looked confused like
he  did  not  remember  when  he  reminded  Applicant  of  his  marijuana  use  with  his
stepfather.  He  believes  Applicant  is  an  honest  and  truthful  person.  He  completely
believes  Applicant’s  testimony  that  he  did  not  report  his  drug  use  because  he  forgot
about it.13
Applicant  stated  that  he  only  remembered  the  cocaine  use  when  he  was  being
questioned  about  his  foreign  contacts  in  a  pre-polygraph  interview  for  the  government
agency.  While  discussing  his  foreign  boyfriend,  the  interviewer  asked  him  if  they  ever
used  drugs,  which  triggered  his  memory  that  they  used  cocaine,  and  he  divulged  that
information to the interviewer.14
Applicant  spent  two  years  in  Afghanistan  working  for  a  defense  contractor  in
support  of  the  U.S.  forces.  He  regularly  volunteers  in  his  community.  He  submitted
documents  and  letters,  and  he  called  six  witnesses  who  attested  to  his  excellent  job
performance in the military and in his current job. He is praised for his trustworthiness,
technical  expertise,  honesty,  reliability,  moral  character,  patriotism,  work  ethic,
dedication,  judgment,  maturity,  professionalism,  leadership,  loyalty,  and  integrity.  His
witnesses  are  all  aware  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.  They  completely  believe
Applicant’s statements and testimony that he did not report his marijuana and cocaine
use because he forgot about it. They recommend that he retain his security clearance.15
