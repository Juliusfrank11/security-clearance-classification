Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations with explanations. Her admissions are
incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review  of the  pleadings and evidence, I
make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She began working
at her present job in approximately March 2018. From January 2016 to March 2018, she
was a shift supervisor for corporate security. She is single, never  married, and has no
children. She earned a bachelor’s degree in 2009.1
The SOR alleged Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in July 2015 and
that the dischargeable debts were discharged in November 2015. The SOR also alleged
four  charged-off  student  loans  totaling  approximately  $135,516.  The  allegations  are
supported  by  court  documents  showing  the  2015  bankruptcy  and  credit  reports  from
November  2017,  April  2018,  and  March  2019  showing  the  delinquent  student  loans.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.e).2
Applicant  credibly  explained  that  when  she  graduated  from  college  in  2009  she
had  accumulated  approximately  $80,000  worth  of  student  loans  paying  for  her
education.  For  some  period  after  her  graduation  she  was  unemployed  and
underemployed because of the poor economy. Her loans were deferred during this time,
but  they  were  incurring  interest  charges  at  rates  between  15%  and  19%.  When  she
finally  secured  employment  in  her  chosen  field,  her  annual  salary  was  approximately
$42,000 and her student loan amounts had risen to approximately $160,000. She could
not  afford  to  make  the  $2,000  monthly  payments  the  credit  holders  were  demanding.
She sought to consolidate the loans, but the creditor refused. She was willing to pay her
student loans, but she was unable to do so.3
Applicant  kept  in  contact  with  her  student  loan  creditor,  but  she  also  sought
advice from an attorney. In 2015, she spoke with an attorney who advised her that she
should  file  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  and  include  her  student  loans  in  the  bankruptcy.
Applicant  reluctantly  followed  this  advice  and  included  her  student  loans  in  her
bankruptcy. Her total liabilities listed in the petition were approximately $181,000 and of
that amount approximately $161,000 were from her student loans. She had never been
delinquent on her other debts listed in the bankruptcy before her attorney advised her to

stop paying them so they could be included in the bankruptcy. Her petition was granted
and  her  debts  were  discharged  except  for  her  student  loans  which  were  non-
dischargeable in bankruptcy. Applicant was given incorrect advice by her attorney.4
Applicant sought assistance from  a second attorney who began negotiating with
the student loan creditor in August 2017 about reaching a settlement. The creditor sued
Applicant in state court, but those claims were all involuntarily dismissed by the judge in
August,  October,  and  December  2018.  Despite  these  dismissals,  Applicant  had  her
attorney  purse  settlement  negotiations  with  the  creditor.  The  settlement  terms  were
reached  in  March  2019  and  include  Applicant  paying  a  total  of  $30,000  through  four
payments.  Applicant  documented  that  she  completed  her  payments  under  the
agreement.  Applicant  obtained  these  funds  from  her  parents  who  recently  won  a  $1
million  lottery.  All  her  student  loans  are  now  resolved.  Her  March  2019  credit  report
shows no other delinquent debt.5
Based upon Applicant’s recent personal financial statement, her financial affairs
are  in  good  order  showing  a  monthly  surplus  of  approximately  $1,468.  She  received
financial  counseling  through  her  bankruptcy,  and  more  recently,  as  advised  by  her
second  attorney.  She  also  provided  three  character  letters  from  two  former  coworkers
and a personal friend. All attest to her honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness.6
