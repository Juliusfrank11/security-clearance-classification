Applicant is a 54-year-old pilot instructor, employed by a defense contractor since
2017. From 2005 to 2013, Applicant worked as a retail salesman, a director of a youth
club, a fireplace technician, and as a rock climbing guide and yoga instructor. He next
operated a lodge business with his current spouse from May 2013 until the business failed
in February 2014. He was unemployed for about one month in 2014 while he requalified
for  his  pilot’s  license,  then  he  worked  as  an  airline  pilot  from  2014  to  2015,  and  as  a
contract military instructor pilot from 2015 to 2017. (GE 1) Applicant twice filed Chapter 7
bankruptcy;  first  in  2000  that  was  discharged  in  2001,  and  next  in  2010  that  was
discharged in 2011.
Applicant received a bachelor’s degree from a U.S. military academy in 1986, and
served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force until he was honorably discharged in 1998.
(Tr. 9) He was previously married in 1990 and divorced in 2001. He remarried in 2007,
and has four adult children. Applicant held a security clearance while on active duty until
he was discharged in 1998 (Tr. 7).
The SOR alleges under Guideline F, that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in
2010 that was discharged in 2011; failed to file Federal income tax returns for tax years
2010  to  2016;  is  delinquent  on  unpaid  state  sales  tax  totaling  about  $2,000;  and  two
delinquent  real-estate  timeshare  debts  totaling  over  $15,800.  Applicant  admitted  the
bankruptcy, Federal income tax filing delinquency,  and state sales tax allegations, and
denied the two timeshare debts. (Ans.) He noted in his answer to the SOR, that he was
working on the delinquent Federal tax returns, and that the state sales tax debt is paid.
Applicant first filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2000 as a result of about $200,000 in
debt largely incurred in treating his first spouse’s alcohol and drug problems, and mental
instability. He testified that her problems became apparent in 2000, and that her drug and
alcohol abuse drove them into bankruptcy “with [his] permission at the time,” because he
willingly used treatment centers that cost as much as $900 per day. He also developed
his own health issues causing him to resign his job and move to another state, but could
not find executive level employment. (Tr. 42-44) Applicant’s second spouse worked and
cohabitated with him beginning in 2003, and contributed to household income. However,
Applicant claims that some credit card debts “slipped through the cracks” and were not
listed in his first bankruptcy filing. Applicant claims that creditors began pursuing about
$13,000 in delinquent debt, interest and fees, seven years after his first bankruptcy. (Tr.
46)  A  judgment  was  entered  against  Applicant  in  2004  and  a  delinquent  credit-card
account opened in 2002, well after his first bankruptcy. (Tr. 46-47) He filed his second
Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010, and discharged about $33,000 in liabilities in 2011. (GE 5)
Appellant’s  spouse  testified  that  they  are  in  the  process  of  exploring  filing  another
bankruptcy  (Tr.  29,  34).  In  Applicant’s  post-hearing  submission,  he  provided  evidence
that he and his spouse completed internet credit counseling mandated by the bankruptcy
court on June 20, 2019, the day before the hearing in this case. (AE E)
SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e allege debts to a financial company on timeshare properties,
totaling  about  $15,818.  In  2011,  Applicant  purchased  an  interest  in  two  timeshare
properties, but refused to pay a debt incurred because he believed the seller operated in
bad  faith.  (Tr.  48-51)  Appellant’s  spouse  disputed  a  debt  to  the  credit  bureaus,  and
reported  the  results  were  “inconclusive.”  (Tr.  51)  Applicant  testified  that  he  “gave  the
property  back.”  (Tr. 50) The  debts  were  reported  on  Applicant’s  combined  2017  credit
report (GE 3), but do not appear on his August 2018 Equifax credit report (GE 4). In his
post-hearing  submission,  Applicant  provided  a  “screen  shot”  from  a  free  online  credit
access company, suggesting a dispute filed against a known debt collection agency, and
a  separate  page  showing  a  collection  account  for the  timeshare  debt  in  question.  The
debt  collection  company  dispute  was  apparently  filed  in  2016,  and  Applicant  noted  in
handwriting on the document, that no response was received on the dispute as of June
21,  2019.  (AE  E)  It  is  unclear  whether  the  page  showing  the  debt  collection  company
dispute is related to the page showing the timeshare debt. The timeshare debt page only
shows that the joint account was opened in 2014, and it was placed for collection. (AE E)
Of note, Applicant’s 2017 credit report does not show the timeshare debt being collected
by  the  debt  collection  agency,  or  any  other collection  agency.  (GE  3)  Finally,  no  clear
documentary evidence was presented showing the current status of the timeshare debts,
communications with the creditor, or a final resolution of the debts was provided.
Applicant did not file Federal income tax returns when due, for tax years 2010 to
2016. During the hearing, he admitted that he also failed to file his 2017 or 2018 Federal
income tax returns when due. Although Applicant’s spouse primarily handled tax return
preparation for the family, Applicant knew that she was not filing returns. (Tr. 39) Applicant
testified that:
At the time it’s – it’s an old pilot deal. Here’s everything that’s on my plate
to do, here’s what I have the capacity to effect [sic] so I let the taxes go.”
(Tr. 56) Needless to say, I am not good at taxes and I intentionally delayed
them until I could reasonably get to them and until we had the resources to
actually hire a new CPA to help us with it and found the right one. So I suck
at taxes. (Tr. 63-64)
Applicant’s spouse testified that tax returns went unfiled, in part, as a result of a
sexual assault of her by their tax accountant in 2008. She did not disclose the assault to
Applicant  until  2013  or  2014,  nor  did  they  report  the  assault  to  authorities,  but  they
continued to use the same accountant for several years after the incident. (Tr. 36-37) Of
note,  Applicant’s  spouse  was  also  caring  for  her  parents  in  around  2008,  and  was
suffering from her own  illness  which  led  to her  employment  termination  in  2012 and  a
diagnosis of a brain tumor in 2013. (Tr. 36-37) She has not worked since 2013, except
for  their  lodge  business,  purchased  in  March  2013  and  ended  in  February  2014.  The
business  failure  resulted  in  foreclosure  of  the  lodge  property  and  about  $250,000  in
losses. (Tr. 29, 33; GE 2)
Applicant filed his 2010 Federal tax return in April 2015. His 2011 and 2012 Federal
tax returns were completed and signed on June 4, 2019, two days before his hearing in
this case. (AE A and B) Federal tax returns for 2013-2018 were completed and signed on
June  21,  2019,  the  date  the  post-hearing  submissions  were  due.  The  post-hearing
submission included Federal e-filing authorizations for his 2017 and 2018 tax returns, also
completed and signed on June 21, 2019. There is no documentary evidence showing the
2013 to 2016 tax returns were submitted to the IRS. Of note, Applicant stated in his post-
hearing  email  that:  “[a]ll  documents  are  being  sent  certified  mail  or  have  already
been e-filed.” (emphasis added) (AE E)
Applicant reported in his SCA and his interview with a Government investigator,
that he owed a state government $1,000 to $2,000 for unpaid sales tax. (SOR ¶ 1.c) He
noted in his interview, that he received letters from the state tax authorities, but that he
did  not  have  the  money  to  pay  the  debt.  In  his  post-hearing  submission,  Applicant
provided documentary evidence that two state tax liens from the state in question totaling
approximately $1,616, were released on October 23, 2017. It is unclear from the evidence
whether the two satisfied liens are related to the state sales tax debt.

Applicant’s  colleague
in  support  of  Applicant’s  honesty  and
trustworthiness.  They  have  worked  together  as  pilots  on  government  contracts  since
2015. In addition, Applicant submitted a letter of support from his current site manager,
who  attested  to  Applicant’s  work  ethic,  integrity,  dedication,  leadership  skills,  and
trustworthiness with classified information. Applicant’s current income is about $9,000 per
month, and he has about $4,500 in savings.
Law and Policies
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484  U.S.  518, 528  (1988). As  Commander in  Chief,  the President  has  the  authority  to
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is  clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An
administrative  judge  must  consider  a  person’s  stability,  trustworthiness,  reliability,
discretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG ¶ 1(b).
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the
possible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant
has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the  President  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  have
established for issuing a clearance.
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the
personal or professional history  of  the applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant from
being  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information.  The  Government  has  the  burden  of
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. “Substantial
evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. Washington
Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a
nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the  criteria  listed
therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3
(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015).
Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG ¶ 1(d).
