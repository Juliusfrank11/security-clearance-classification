Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact. He is 27 years old, married, and he has one child, a minor. He has
owned his home since approximately 2018. (Answer; Tr. at 9, 45-66, 85; GE 1; AE I).
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  2010.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree
from  The  U.S.  Military  Academy  at  West  Point  (West  Point)  in  2014  and  was
commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army. He was involuntarily honorably
discharged in November 2016. He was unemployed until March 2017, when he became
a systems engineer for his current employer, a defense contractor. As of the date of the
hearing, he was pursuing his master’s degree and expected to obtain it in May 2020. He
has held a security clearance since 2011. (Tr. at 6-7, 85-90, 96-100, 105-115, 144-146,
163; GE 1, 4, 5, 6; AE D, F, I, K, M, N).
Applicant  began  consuming  alcohol  when  he  was  a  senior  in  high  school.  He
drank a few beers on occasion. He did not consume alcohol during his first year at West
Point, but drank about five to seven beers on the six to seven occasions when he was
on  leave from West  Point during  his second  year.  His  leave  increased  during  his  third
year  and  he  drank  five  to  seven  beers  on  12  to  14  occasions.  By  his  fourth  year,  he
consumed six to nine beers approximately once monthly. (Tr. at 164-167; AE I).
In  November 2014,  Applicant  was  cited  with  public  drunkenness.  He  was  a  22-
year-old flight school student. He described his level of alcohol consumption during this
period  as  the  same  as  his  fourth  year  at West  Point.  He  and  his  classmates  had  just
completed  their  two-month  basic  officer  leadership  course  and  decided  to  attend  a
weekend  college football  game  during  their two  week  break  to  “blow  some  steam off.”
He  drank  beer  and  mixed  drinks  from  early  in  the  day  while  tailgating,  fell  asleep
sometime after the game commenced, and was wakened by a campus police officer for
sleeping  in  public  and  taken  to  a  local drunk  tank  to  get  sober.  He  was  cited,  pled  no
contest, and paid his fine. He “laid low” from consuming alcohol for a while because he
was upset and ashamed of himself. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a, 3.a; Tr. at 90-96, 100-103, 146-
147, 167-168, 171-172; GE 1; AE I).
From November 2014 to April 2016, Applicant was “deep into the training of flight
school.” He and his classmates consumed alcohol at a friend’s house or a local bar to
“enjoy the free time that we did have.” By January 2016,  his alcohol consumption had
increased  to  eight  to  ten  beers  every  weekend.  In  April  2016,  he  was  arrested  and
charged with driving under the influence (DUI). This was his first DUI. He was 23 years
old and a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army. He was less than one week from flight school
graduation and felt “on top of the world . . . a little bit invincible.” He attended a party at
a friend’s house with the intention of spending the night. He consumed beer and mixed
drinks and drove home. The police stopped him after he took “a right-hand turn out of
the  straight-only  lane”  and  then  a  “left-hand  turn  without  signaling  my  turn.”  Upon  his
arrest,  he  initially  denied  having  consumed  alcohol  out  of  fear,  but  then  admitted  to
drinking during his field sobriety test. His blood alcohol content (BAC) was .16%. (SOR
¶¶ 1.b, 2.a, 3.a; Tr. at 60, 90-96, 103-117, 147-154, 158-161, 168-169, 172-173; GE 1,
2, 4, 5, 6, 8; AE I, J, M, N).
The  DUI  was  nolle  prossed.  The  U.S.  Army  revoked  Applicant’s  driving
privileges;  issued  him  a  General  Officer  Memorandum  of  Reprimand  (GOMR)  in  May
2016; and notified him in July 2016 that he would be involuntarily honorably discharged.
He  enrolled  in  and  completed  the  Army  Substance  Abuse  Program  (ASAP)  in  May
2016,  through  which  he  received  alcohol  counseling.  He  did  not  consume  alcohol  for
three  months  from  around  April  to  July  2016.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  2.a,  3.a;  Tr.  at  60,  90-96,
103-117, 147-154, 158-161, 168-169, 172-173; GE 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8; AE I, J, M, N).
While  Applicant’s  involuntary  discharge  was  pending,  he  was  charged  with  his
second  DUI  in  October  2016.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  2.a,  3.a).  He  was  24  years  old.  He  had
resumed consuming alcohol in July 2016 as self-medication for his depression about his
“unknown future and unknown fate.” His tipping point occurred in September 2016 when
his roommate moved out. He found himself socializing with “bar buddies” who he did not
really  know  and he  did  not  communicate or  seek  help from  his family  or friends.  On a
holiday  weekend,  he  consumed  alcohol  at  a  Halloween  party.  He  then  drove  to  a  bar
where he continued to consume alcohol. On his drive home, he was going too fast upon
arriving at an intersection, tried to turn his car sideways, hit  a curb, and flipped his car
into a ditch. His BAC was .23%. The DUI was dismissed. He was discharged from the
U.S Army honorably, due to unacceptable conduct. (SOR ¶ 3.b; Tr. at 90-96, 108, 117-
125, 132-133, 154-161, 168-169, 172-174; GE 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8; AE F, I, M, N).
Applicant confided in his parents and wife after his second DUI. During his two-
to  three-week  out processing  from  the  U.S.  Army,  he  received  alcohol  counseling  and
treatment from the same ASAP counselor as his first DUI. The counselor diagnosed him
with  alcohol-related  disorder,  moderate  and  recommended  that  he  attend  Alcoholics
Anonymous  (AA)  and abstain from alcohol. His  father  took  him to his first  AA meeting
and he attended AA daily for two to three weeks. He testified that he accepted that he is
an  alcoholic  at  his  first  AA  meeting.  He  then  returned  to  live  with  his  parents  and
continued  to  attend  AA  meetings  weekly  to  twice  weekly  from  approximately  March
2017 until April 2018, when he relocated. He attended one to two AA meetings in June
2018. Since his October 2016 DUI, he consumed alcohol on  three occasions when he
was with close friends and family: he had three beers at his wedding in December 2016,
and four to five beers on two occasions in January 2017. (Tr. at 50, 60, 62-66, 121, 125-
144, 161-164,172-178; GE 1; AE A, I).
Applicant  has  not  consumed  alcohol  since  January  2017.  He  intends  to  remain
sober.  He  testified  that  although  he  intends  to  resume  with  AA  meetings,  he  does  not
rely  on  AA  to  maintain  his  sobriety.  He  has  instead  focused  on  his  family,  job,
education,  exercise,  home,  church,  and  friendships  that  are  not  centered  around
alcohol. In June 2018, he sought an alcohol evaluation and his previous diagnosis was
updated
remission.  He  was
recommended  to  continue  with  AA  and  remain  sober.  He  does  not  have  any  other
alcohol-related  incidents.  He  testified  that  he  identified  that  the  root  cause  of  his
problems was alcohol, so he completely removed it from his life. He testified:
to  alcohol-use  disorder,  moderate
in  sustained
I  don’t  regret  what  happened,  because  my  life  has  completely  turned
around from it. I think if I didn’t have the second DUI, I would really, truly
[not]  realized  I  had  a  problem  until  something  worse  might  have
happened.
(Tr. at 50, 60, 62-66, 121, 125-144, 161-164, 175-178; AE B, C, I).
Applicant  disclosed  to  his  previous  and  current  managers  his  first  DUI  and  his
consequent military discharge.  He testified that he  would disclose his second DUI, but
had  not  done  so  because  he  was  not  so  required,  since  it  was  not  a  conviction.  He
received a performance evaluation rating of “successful” from his employer in 2017 and
an “excellent” rating in 2018.  (Tr. at 96-100, 170-171; AE E, G, I, L).
Applicant’s  wife  testified.  She met and began  dating Applicant  in 2014  and  was
aware  of  his  alcohol-related  incidents  and  involuntary  discharge  from  the  U.S.  Army.
She  reiterated  that  he  has  not  consumed  alcohol  since  January  2017.  She  does  not
consume  alcohol.  She  testified  that  though  they  have  found  themselves  in  social
situations  where  alcohol is present,  to  include  through  their  intramural kickball  league,
she  has  no  concerns  about  his  ability  to  maintain  sobriety.    She  described  him  as  a
matured,  responsible, determined,  self-motivated  individual  “focused  on his health and
his career and family” who has “turned his life around.” She testified that Applicant has
“realized that alcohol serves no purpose in his life.” (Tr. at 45-66; AE H).
One of Applicant’s West Point classmates, who was also a roommate on various
occasions, testified. The witness was serving in the U.S. military on active duty as of the
date  of  the  hearing.  He  was  aware  of  the  SOR  allegations.  He  testified  that  while
attending West Point, he, Applicant, and their peers drank fairly often on the weekends.
Though  he  did  not  consider  Applicant  to  have  an  alcohol  problem,  he  was
“disappointed”  but  “not  completely  blindsided”  when  he  learned  of  Applicant’s  DUIs.
Since  graduation,  they  communicate  approximately  once  monthly  and  see  each  other
occasionally.  The  witness  testified  that  Applicant  informed  him  about  Applicant’s
sobriety.  The  witness  also  observed  Applicant  practice  sobriety  on  around  four
occasions  and  stated  that  he  has  no  concerns  with  Applicant’s  ability  to  maintain  his
sobriety.  He  described  Applicant  as  “very  intelligent”  and  one  who  has  “always  done
very well at everything he set his mind to.” (Tr.at 33-44; AE G).
Applicant’s colleague and mentor since 2017 testified. She previously interacted
with  him  daily,  but  since  his relocation  in  April 2018  they  interacted  twice  weekly.  She
testified  that  she  was  aware  of  his  alcohol-related  incidents  and  involuntary  military
discharge. She testified that he “has always  been one of the highest performing junior
engineers”  who  “performs  above  his  level.”  As  such,  she  has  given  his  managers
“extremely  positive”  peer  feedback  for  his  performance  evaluations.  She  testified  that
she  had  been  in  social  situations  with  Applicant  and  never  observed  him  consuming
alcohol.  She  was  aware  that  he  was  sober.  She  considers  him  to  be  an  honest  and
trustworthy individual. Numerous professional and social character references describe
Applicant  as  a  man  of  exemplary  character,  with  demonstrated
integrity  and
trustworthiness. (Tr. at 66-84; AE G).
