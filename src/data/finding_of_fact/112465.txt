Applicant is 54 years old. He graduated from high school in 1982, and obtained
his  associate’s  degree  in  December  1986.  Applicant  has  been  employed  as  a  senior
programmer  by  a  federal  contractor  since  November  2012.  He  reported  a  period  of
unemployment  from  June  2012  to  November  2012.  Applicant    reported  no  military
service  and  a  previous  security  clearance  from  DOD  in  September  2002.  Applicant
married in September 1998 and he has a 19 year-old daughter.
Applicant reported the delinquent debt, which was placed for collection by a bank
in  the  amount  of  $31,702,  in  section  26  of  his  security  clearance  application  (SCA).2
There,  he  stated  his  intention  to  contact  an  attorney  to  resolve  this  delinquency  by
making payment arrangements with the creditor. In his Answer to the SOR on July 12,
2018,  Applicant  admitted  this  single  alleged  delinquent  debt.  Applicant  claims  that  he
was  laid  off  by  his  employer  in  June  2012,  and  he  fell  behind  on  his  mortgage
payments. He produced no documentary evidence to show that he followed through and
contacted  an  attorney  or  of  any  repayment  arrangement.  He  stated  that  he  had  a
household  reduction  in  income  of  30%  and  he  depleted  his  401k  account  to  make
mortgage payments during his period of unemployment. 3
The  single  debt  in  the  amount  of  $31,702  alleged  in  the  SOR  was  for  a  credit
card account that was opened in April 1998 and Applicant’s March 2017 credit bureau
report  reflects  the  last  activity  on  that  account  was  in  November  2012.  (Item  5)  In  his
January  2018  PSI,  Applicant  stated  that  his  financial  problems  were  due  to  his
unemployment  for  six  months  in  2012,  and  he  is  now  capable  of  meeting  financial
expenses    and  paying  the  delinquent  debt  if  needed.  (Item  4)  He  stated  his  “plans  to
contact this creditor and make payment arrangements within 3 months if there is still an
outstanding  balance.”4  He  was  given
to  provide  additional
documentation  regarding  the  financial  delinquency.  He  only  provided  documentation
showing that his mortgage account is current with no past due payments. (attachment to
