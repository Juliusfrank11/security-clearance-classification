Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.g. He denied SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.h, and 1.i.
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  had  a  Federal  tax  lien  entered  against  him  in  2015  for
delinquent taxes from unstated years in the amount of $36,130; was delinquent on child
support payments in the amount of $7,759; had a home in foreclosure in November 2014;
and had  six  other  delinquent  consumer accounts  totaling  $41,102.  Applicant  disclosed
the majority of his debts on his 2016 security clearance application. (Answer; Response;
Item  4.)  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits,  I  make  the
following findings of fact:
Applicant  is  47  years  old.  He  has  worked  in  his  position  since  August  2008,
although the contractor for whom he worked changed in 2013. He was unemployed from
July 2006 to January 2007 and May 2008 to August 2008. He was married from 1999
through 2012. He has three adult children, two from his marriage and one from a prior
relationship.  He  previously  had  financial  difficulties,  which  led  to  a  discharge  of  debt
through Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2001. (Item 4; Item 5; Item 10.)
Applicant  attributes  his  delinquent  accounts  to  his  contentious  divorce  and
unemployment. Their separation and divorce were caused by infidelity on the part of his
ex-wife. (Response; Answer; Item 10.)
Applicant was indebted on a Federal tax lien entered against him in 2015 in the
amount of $36,130, as stated in SOR ¶ 1.a. The tax debt pertains to tax years 2010, 2011,
and  2012,  when  Applicant  failed  to  have  proper  payroll  withholdings.  He  has  since
corrected  his  payroll  withholdings.  In  his  response,  he  explained  that  he  has  been
repaying his tax debts since 2014 in the amount of $700 per month, although his records
do  not  show  a  steady  stream  of  payments  until  2016.  Applicant  provided  IRS  tax
transcripts and transaction statements from his bank that show Applicant established a
new installment agreement with the IRS in April 2016, and has made consistent monthly
payments since September 2016. His balance for the 2010 tax year had decreased from
$18,820 to $546, as of October 2018. Once 2010 is resolve, his payments will presumably
be  applied  to  his  2011  and  2012  unresolved  Federal  taxes.  Applicant  is  resolving  his
Federal tax debt. (Answer; Response; Item 10.)
Applicant was indebted to a credit union on a charged-off account in the amount
of $20,939, as stated in SOR ¶ 1.b. In April 2017, Applicant established a payment plan
with this creditor to resolve this debt through monthly payments of $300. As of April 19,
2018,  Applicant  had  repaid  $3,800  of  this  debt,  as  documented  in  a  letter  from  this
creditor. Applicant is resolving this debt. (Answer; Response.)
Applicant  was  indebted  on  a  charged-off  account  in  the  amount  of  $1,621,  as
stated in SOR ¶ 1.c. Applicant provided a letter from this creditor, dated April 16, 2018,
offering to settle this account for six payments of $175.66. He indicated he intended to
resolve this debt as funds allow. (Answer.)
Applicant  was  indebted  on  a  collection  account  owed  to  a  telecommunications
service provider in the amount of $165, as stated in SOR ¶ 1.d. This debt was incurred
when Applicant switched service providers, but was unaware of the delinquency. He paid
this debt on April 21, 2018. (Answer.)
Applicant and his ex-wife purchased a residence in December 2004 for $542,000,
financed through a mortgage. Applicant paid that loan through May 2011, until he moved
out due to his separation. For a year prior to moving out, he attempted to sell the property,
but its value had declined and was worth less than what he owed on the mortgage. He
received  an  offer  that  the  bank  approved,  but  his  ex-wife  would  not  sign  the  required
documents  needed  to  sell  the  property  in  2012.  He  provided  a  copy  of  the  real-estate
listing and the purchase offer. His home was foreclosed upon by the mortgage holder in
approximately November 2014, as stated in SOR ¶ 1.g. Applicant was delinquent on a
home-owners association fee related to this property, totaling $5,032, as stated in SOR ¶
1.e. (Answer.) This debt was for homeowners association fees incurred after he moved
out of the property and added assessments for not maintaining the yard after he vacated
the property. Applicant credibly asserted that he contacted this creditor and was told this
debt was resolved. (Item 4.)
Applicant was delinquent on a judgment filed against him in September 2010 in
the  amount  of  $17,721,  as  stated  in  SOR  ¶  1.f.  This  account  became  delinquent  after
Appellant was laid off. He claimed to have a payment plan in place with this creditor. He
provided nothing further in this regard. (Answer.)
Applicant was delinquent on his child support obligation in the amount of $7,759,
as stated in SOR ¶ 1.h. This debt was for his first child. He was unable to pay child support
during  his  periods  of  unemployment.  Applicant  documented  regular,  $150  monthly
payments on this debt. His balance has been reduced to $3,934. Applicant is resolving
this debt. (Answer.)
Applicant was delinquent on a collection account in the amount of $656 as stated
in SOR ¶ 1.i. He denied this debt because he contacted both the collection agent and the
original creditor “and both companies do not have information relating to amount balance
or records stating that there’s an amount owed.” (Answer.) He indicated he was “ready,
and able to pay” but the creditor could find no record of this debt. (Answer.)
