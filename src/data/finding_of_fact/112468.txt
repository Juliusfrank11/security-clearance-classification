Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since March 2017. He has a bachelor’s degree, awarded in 2006,
and a master’s degree, awarded in 2007. He is single without children.1
Applicant  smoked  marijuana  when  he  was  in  college  and  graduate  school  and
less frequently after he graduated. He held a security clearance when he worked for a
defense  contractor  from  2007  to  2011.  He  reported  on  a  Questionnaire  for  National
Security Positions (SF 86) in April 2017 that he used marijuana on about 60 occasions
between 2002 and 2016, including while holding a security clearance. He stated that he
did not intend to use marijuana in the future:
My use has always been casual, and only when it was offered to me. I’ve
in
generally  been  unemployed  or  self-employed,  and  usually
states/countries where it’s already been legalized. I don’t have any desire
to use it when it would directly affect my livelihood.2
In response to DOHA interrogatories in April 2018, Applicant admitted that he ate
cookies  baked  with  marijuana  in  July  2017,  and  that  on  October  31,  2017,  a  friend
offered  him  a  “vaporizer-pen  with  some  marijuana  in  its  contents.”  Applicant  “took  a
single  pull  and  barely  felt  any  effects.”  He  again  stated  that  he  did  not  intend  to  use
marijuana in the future:
Though I have admitted that I am not against Marijuana, I also use it very
infrequently. Since the experience on October 31st, I haven’t used it since.
I have never purchased it, nor any related paraphernalia. Upon conducting
the  clearance  interview  [in  December  2017],  I  realized  that  I  would  not
want to jeopardize my employment for its occasional use.3
In  his  June  2018  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  stated  that  he  was  an
infrequent marijuana user, and that he “clearly underestimated the gravity and severity
of  choosing  to  use  marijuana  during  this  specific  period  [2009-2011]  under  which  [he]
held a clearance.” His marijuana use never adversely affected his job performance, and
he  volunteered  to  work  in  Iraq.  He  now  fully  understands  that  marijuana  use  is
inconsistent with holding a security clearance. He moved to a different city, away from
the  people  with  whom  he  used  marijuana.  He  signed  a  statement  of  intent  to  abstain
from all drug involvement and substance misuse.4
