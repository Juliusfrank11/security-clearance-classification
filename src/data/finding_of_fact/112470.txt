In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR 13 financial allegations (¶¶
1.a through 1.m). He submitted comments in mitigation and explanation noting that he
had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy (SOR ¶ 1.a) and was anticipating the discharge of all
remaining SOR debts (¶¶ 1.b through 1.m) in the near future, releasing him of any legal
obligation  to pay  those  debts.  (Answer  to SOR)  His  SOR  admissions and  those  at  his
hearing are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  35  years  old.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  2001,  and  has
completed  no  additional  formal  education.  He  married  in  2006,  and  has  five  children
(two biological, one foster child, and two adopted) ages 16, 10, 3, and 2 (twins).
Applicant has been working for federal contractors since 2007. He has performed
the same work, but for several federal contractors depending on who held the contract.
He  was  granted  a  secret  clearance  in  2008,  which  has  been  continued  to  present.
Applicant was hired by his current employer and clearance sponsor in January 2017. He
seeks  the  continuation  of  his  clearance  which  is  required  for  his  work  with  his  current
employer.
In  response  to  Section  26  (Financial  Record)  of  his  2017  SCA,  Applicant
disclosed  he  was  seeking  assistance  to  resolve  his  financial  problems,  and  alluded  to
attempts to refinance his home, a car, and a late mortgage payment. He noted that he
had  notified  his  facility  security  officer  (FSO)  of  his  financial  problems.  He  also  stated
that  he  consulted  an  attorney  in  October  2017,  with  a  view  to  filing  Chapter  7
bankruptcy, and was in the process of setting up a credit counseling class.
In  his  SOR  response,  Applicant  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  the  higher
cost  of  medical  insurance,  out-of-pocket  medical  expenses,  medical  leave,  reduced
income  due  to  being  in  disability,  remodeling  his  home  for  his  growing  family,  his
inability to refinance his home, having to purchase a home water treatment system, and
the reduction on his wife’s working hours, and ultimately her unemployment to take care
of their children in October 2017.
Applicant  has  been  continuously  employed  since  2007,  with  no  periods  of
unemployment.  However,  he  was  out  of  work  due  to  undergoing  surgery  and  was
placed on disability between April and October 2018. While in short-term disability (April
through August 2018), his income was reduced by $1,000 per month, and while in long-
term  disability  (September  through  October  2018),  his  income  was  further  reduced  by
an additional $300 per month.
At hearing, Applicant acknowledged that his financial problems were partially due
to him making poor financial decisions. He noted that he went through periods where he
used  his  credit  cards  to  supplement  his  and  his  family’s  income  and  to  pay  for  their
living expenses and yearly vacations. (Tr. 31, 92) He averred that other expenses were
due to circumstances beyond his control. (Tr. 26) As examples, he noticed the cost of
his  daughter’s  braces,  totaling  $5,000  that  he  incurred  after  his  insurance  denied
payment in in 2017. He took a loan to pay for his daughter’s braces in August 2018. He
also  noted  an  unknown  number  of  expensive  fertility  tests  that  his  wife  underwent  to
determine why they could not have more children in about 2012-2013. (Tr. 28)
After  the  tests,  Applicant  and  is  wife  decided  to  adopt,  and  they  incurred
additional  expenses  to  get  their  home  certified  for  the  adoptions,  including,  a  home
water  filtration  system  at  a  cost  of  over  $5,500.  He  later  defaulted  on  that  account’s
payments.  The  debt  was  included  in  his  Chapter  7  bankruptcy,  and  Applicant  claimed
he reaffirmed the debt after his bankruptcy discharge. (SOR ¶ 1.g) However, as of his
hearing date, he had not set up a payment plan to pay this creditor.
Concerning  his  yearly  vacations,  Applicant  testified  that  his  family  have  been
taking “one big [vacation] once a year” during the last six years. They drive to Florida for
a week to 10 days, and try to stay with family. (Tr. 93) Sometimes, Applicant would take
leave  without  pay  and  use  his  credit  cards  to  pay  for  his  vacation  expenses.  At  his
hearing, he acknowledged that it was a poor decision to spend money you do not have.
(Tr. 83)
Applicant  and  his  wife  bought  a  small  house  in  2003  and  lived  in  it  until  2011.
They rented a residence between June 2011 and April 2012. Sometime between 2010
and 2011, Applicant took a $10,000 personal loan to consolidate his debts. (Tr. 54) That
loan remained delinquent until it was discharged through bankruptcy in 2018. In 2013,
Applicant  took  a  $10,000  loan  to  purchase  a  car  for  his  wife.  In  November  2017,
Applicant voluntarily returned a car to the creditor because he no longer could afford the
payments.  The  residual  debt  after  the  sale  of  the  car  was  also  discharged  through
bankruptcy.
Applicant purchased their current home in 2012. He explained that up until then,
all the furniture they had was second hand. When they bought their current home they
bought  new  furniture  (a  lawn  mower,  tools,  a  generator,  a  snow  blower,  etc.)  and
acquired a significant debt. (Tr. 65-66) He took another personal loan to consolidate his
debts. (Tr. 58) He claimed some of the debt was paid, but some carried on over time.
(Tr. 32)
In 2016, Applicant took a $50,000 personal loan to consolidate debts and use the
remaining balance to finish his house basement. (Tr. 31, 36, SOR ¶ 1.g) He used part of
the  $50,000  loan  to  pay  previous  debt  consolidation  loans.  (Tr.  56)  His  plan  was  to
finish  the  house  basement,  anticipating  based  on  his  own  research,  that  the  house
reappraisal  would be at  least  $40,000 to  $50,000  higher.  He  then would  refinance  the
house  for  the  higher  value  and  take  some  of  his  equity  money  to  pay  off  the  $50,000
personal  loan.  However,  Applicant’s mortgage  payment became 30-days  delinquent  in
October 2017, and he no longer qualified for the refinancing loan.
Applicant’s  income  was  insufficient  to  pay  for  his  living  expenses  and
accumulated debts. He had maxed out his credit cards and was unable to pay them. In
about October 2017, he consulted with a bankruptcy attorney, and scheduled his credit
counseling  classes.  He  notified  his  facility  security  officer  of  his  financial  problems  in
December 2017. He filed his Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2018, and was discharged
of  his  dischargeable  debts  in  July  2018.  (GE  7)  Concerning  his  current  financial
situation, Applicant testified he is making $82,000 yearly. His monthly take-home pay is
about $3,000.
Applicant testified that he reaffirmed his mortgage debt and has been making his
mortgage  payments.  He  submitted  a  checking  account  statement  showing  he  paid
$1,969 in February, March and April 2018; made two payments of $1,969 in May 2018;
made  payments  in  June  and  July  2018;  skipped  the  August  2018  payment;  made  a
payment in September 2018, and made two payments in October 2018. Applicant also
testified  that  he  reaffirmed  his  car  loan  after  the  bankruptcy.  He  presented  a  receipt
from  November  2018,  showing  he  paid  $260  to  a  credit  union,  and  that  the  next
payment would be due in December 2018. (AE 1)
Applicant expressed remorse for his financial problems. He claimed to recognize
the  many  financial  mistakes  he  made,  although  he  does  not  regret  some  of  the
expenses  incurred  such  as  buying  the  new  home,  the  new  furniture,  and  the  fertility
medical  testing.  He  testified  that  he  and  his  wife  no  longer  use  credit  cards,  and  only
purchase necessities with cash.
