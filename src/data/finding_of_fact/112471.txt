Applicant, age 32, was married in 2013 and has three minor children. He received
a high school diploma in 2005. He has been enrolled in a community college since August
2017,  as  part  of  the  apprenticeship  program  with  which  he  has  been  employed  since
January 2017. Applicant was previously granted a DOD security clearance in 2010.
The SOR alleged twelve criminal charges including assault and strangulation of a
family  member  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  2.a),  three  incidents  of  driving  under  the  influence  (DUI)
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.k, 1.l, 2.a, 3.a), four incidents of contempt of court (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, 1.g,
1.h, 2.a), and four incidents of driving on a suspended license (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.f, 1.i, 1.j,
2.a). In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted the following Guideline J allegations: SOR
¶¶  1.a  through  1.c,  1.f,  and  1.k.  Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  Guideline  E  and  G
allegations, which I have construed as denials.
In  December  2016,  Applicant  was  involved  in  a  disagreement  with  his  wife
concerning their child. Applicant’s wife alleged that he assaulted and strangled her, for
which he was arrested and charged (SOR ¶ 1.b). Applicant claimed that his wife tried to
run him over with a vehicle, and admitted that he grabbed her in an effort to stop her from
doing so. However, he denied either assaulting or strangling his wife. A court dismissed
both charges. Applicant and his wife have since reconciled and remain married. (Item 5
at 6 and 8; Item 9 at 5). The Government did not provide any documents to  challenge
Applicant’s version of the facts surrounding the incident or the court’s disposition. (Item 9
at 5, details only the charges).
Applicant admitted two of the three alleged DUI charges. The record established
one DUI in 2009 (SOR ¶ 1.k) and another in 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.a). A 2007 DUI (SOR ¶ 1.l)
was alleged based on the apparent mistaken reliance of a date referenced as “possibly
in 2007” in one portion of Applicant’s 2017 SI. (Item 5 at 7). However, in another portion
of that same 2017 SI, the “possibly in 2017” reference was corrected to 2009. (Item 5 at
7-8). Applicant provided inconsistent accounts of the facts and circumstances of his 2009
DUI during his 2008 and 2017 SIs. The Government neither alleged nor otherwise noted
the discrepancy, nor did it provide any documents to detail the facts and circumstances
of the 2009 DUI.
In February 2009, Applicant did not feel impaired and believed that he was okay
to  drive  after  consuming  alcohol.  The  facts  and  circumstances  surrounding  his
consumption of alcohol prior to driving are uncertain given Applicant’s differing accounts.
He  was  pulled  over  by  a  police  officer  for  speeding.  A  breathalyzer  revealed  a  blood
alcohol count  of  .12%.  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DUI.  In  June  2009,  a
court adjudicated him guilty and sentenced him to 90 days in jail (suspended), restricted
his  driver’s  license  for  a  year,  ordered  him  to  attend  Alcohol  Safety  Action  Program
(ASAP) classes, and fined him $250. (Item 5 at 7-8; Item 6 at 1; Item 8 at 15-16; Item 9
at 5).
Applicant’s March 2017 DUI occurred three days after he submitted his SCA. On
that occasion, he consumed five beers over the course of two to three hours while he was
at a bar with a friend. He did not feel impaired and believed that he was okay to drive
when they left to meet another friend. Applicant hit a guard rail after being cut off by a
semi-truck  on  an  interstate  highway.  The  officer  responding  to  the  accident  smelled
alcohol on Applicant’s breath and administered a breathalyzer, which registered an blood
alcohol count of .12%. Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. In January 2018, a
court adjudicated him guilty and sentenced him to 6 months in jail (all but 10 weekend
days suspended), placed him on unsupervised probation for three years,  restricted his
driver’s  license  for  three  years,  ordered  the  installation  of  an  interlock  device  on  his
vehicle for six months, ordered him to attend ASAP classes, and fined him $500. Applicant
completed his jail term in February 2018. (Item 5 at 6-8; Item 7; Item 8 at 1-2).
Applicant does not believe that he has a problem with alcohol and has never been
diagnosed alcohol dependent or an alcohol abuser. He began consuming alcohol at the
age of 21, regularly consuming approximately two beers a week in social settings with
others. After his daughter was born in February 2014, he reduced the frequency of his
consumption to special occasions approximately twice per year, during which he would
drink to intoxication (approximately five beers). As of December 2017, Applicant had not
consumed any alcohol since his March 2017 DUI and expressed a future intent to abstain
from any consumption of alcohol or driving after consuming alcohol. He cited his daughter
and career as motivation for the abstention. (Item 5 at 9).
In his SOR answer, Applicant denied all four contempt of court charges alleged in
SOR  ¶¶  1.d,  1.e,  1.g,  and  1.h.  In  August  2009,  a  court  adjudicated  Applicant  guilty  in
absentia of the June 2009 charge alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h. (Item 8 at 17-18). The charges
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g involved a mistaken identity and were dismissed by
the court in December 2015. (Item 5 at 8; Item 8 at 3-8, 9 at 5).
Applicant was convicted of two of the four driving on suspended license charges
alleged in the SOR; the other two were dismissed by the court. Despite Applicant’s claim
that his license had been reinstated at the time he was charged in April 2009 (SOR ¶ 1.i),
the court adjudicated him guilty in June 2009 and fined him $100. (Item 6 at 1; Item 8 at
11-12). In June 2013, a court adjudicated Applicant guilty of the March 2013 charge (SOR
¶ 1.c), sentenced him to 30 days in jail (suspended), suspended his driver’s license for
90 days, and fined him $750. (Item 8 at 9-10). Although Applicant did not claim mistaken
identity  as  to  the  November 2010  charge  (SOR  ¶  1.f),  the  record  suggests  that  it  was
dismissed for that reason on December 2015. (Item 8 at 7-8). The November 2010 charge
was  initiated  by  the  same  complainant  and  adjudicated  at  the  same  time  as  the  other
mistaken  identity  charges  noted  above.  Applicant’s  February  2009  charge  (SOR  ¶  1.j)
stemmed from his 2009 DUI, and was dismissed by the court on the same day that the
DUI was adjudicated. (Item 8 at 13-14).
