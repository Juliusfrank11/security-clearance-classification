Applicant  is  a  32-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance for the first time.  She  is employed  as  a  supplier-quality  engineer for a  large
company  in  the  defense  industry.  She  has been  so  employed  since  2017.  Her annual
salary is about $71,000. (Tr. 34) Her formal education includes attendance at a private
university  from  August  2005  to  December  2009,  when  she  was  awarded  a  bachelor’s
degree in mechanical engineering. She also did some graduate work during 2016. She
married  in  2009.  She  and  her  husband  have  no  children.  Her  husband  works  as  a
general  laborer  for  a  transportation  company  with  take-home  pay  of  about  $900
monthly. (Tr. 34)
Applicant’s post-college employment history has been inconsistent. (Exhibit 1) It
includes  multiple  jobs,  periods  of  underemployment,  and  periods  of  unemployment  as
follows:  (1)  she  worked  as  a  caregiver  from  January  2010  to  January  2011;  (2)  she
worked  as  a  contract  engineer  from  January  2011  to  June  2011;  (3)  she  was
unemployed from June 2011 to September 2011; (4) she worked as a mechanical data
team member from September 2011 to April 2012; (5) she worked as an engineer from
April 2012 to May 2013; (6) she was unemployed from May 2013 to September 2013;
(7)  she  worked  as  a  data-entry  clerk  from  September  2013  to  February  2014;  (8)  she
was unemployed from February 2014 to April 2014; (9) she worked as a pizza-delivery
driver from April 2014 to May 2014; (10) she worked as an engineer from May 2014 to
June 2016; (11) she worked as an engineer from June 2016 to August 2016, when she
was  fired  for  attendance  issues  within  the  first  90  days  of  employment;  (12)  she  was
unemployed  from  August  2016  to  October  2016;  (13)  she  worked  as  a  grocery-store
clerk  from  October  2016  to  February  2017;  (14)  she  was  unemployed  from  February
2017 to April 2017; and (15) she worked as kitchen staff at a restaurant from April 2017
until she began her current job in the defense industry in mid-2017.
The  SOR  alleges  and  Applicant  admits  a  history  of  financial  problems.  In
particular, the SOR concerns 17 delinquent accounts for a total of about $95,000. Those
delinquent  accounts  fall  into  three  categories:  (1)  11  medical  collection  accounts  in
amounts  ranging  from  $138  to  $5,790  for  a  total  of  about  $14,361;  (2)  4  student  loan
accounts  in  collection  for  a  total  of  about  $70,877;  and  (3)  2  collection  accounts
stemming  from  early  termination  of  apartment  leases  for  a  total  of  about  $10,325.  In
addition  to  her  admissions,  the  delinquent  accounts  are  established  by  credit  reports
from 2017 and 2018. (Exhibits 2, 3, and 4)
Applicant has made no progress in resolving any of the 17 delinquent accounts.
She did  not  present  documentation  to establish  that any  of  those accounts  were  paid,
settled,  in  a  payment  arrangement,  in  dispute,  cancelled,  forgiven,  or  otherwise
resolved. All 17 delinquent accounts are unresolved.
In both her answer to the SOR and in her hearing testimony, Applicant attributed
her financial problems to her inconsistent employment history. Concerning the medical
collection accounts, she explained that those debts were incurred for necessary medical
care  when  she  was  uninsured.  She  has  health  insurance  with  her  current  job,  but
otherwise  was  uninsured  since  aging-off  her  mother’s  health-insurance  policy.  (Tr. 28-
29)  Concerning  the  student  loan  accounts,  she  stated  that  that  loans  were  at  various
times in forbearance, deferment, or income-based payment plans. (Tr. 39) She has not
had  contact  with  the  student  loan  creditors  in  2018.  (Tr.  55)  She  noted  that  she  has
other student loan accounts that are in good standing, as reflected in Exhibit 4. (Tr. 45)
Concerning  the  apartment  leases,  she  explained  she  was  unable  to  complete  the  full
terms  of  the  leases  due  to  changes  in  employment.  (Tr. 46-50)  She  and  her husband
are in good standing with their current monthly rent and other living expenses. (Tr. 50-
51)
Applicant has about $3,000 in savings in a checking account with a credit union.
(Tr.  52-53)  She  participates  in  her  employer’s  401(k)  plan.  (Tr.  53)  She  has  no  other
financial  or  investment  accounts.  Looking  forward,  she  described  a  general  plan  to
address  her  indebtedness  by  reaching  out  to  her  creditors  with  the  hope  of  reaching
affordable payment plans. (Tr. 54-55)
Applicant has a good employment record for her current job based on the highly
favorable  letter  of  recommendation  submitted  by  a  co-worker  or  supervisor  or  both.
(Exhibit A) The letter described Applicant as diligent and motivated; with potential to be
a  candidate  for  a  long  career;  showing  great  integrity;  and  overall,  an  exceptional
employee with the highest standards who is suitable for a security clearance.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.6
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .

‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no
right to a security clearance).

5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).
6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶¶ E3.1.14 and E3.1.15.
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;
AG  ¶  20(c)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  a  death,  divorce,  or
separation,  clear  victimization  by  predatory  lending  practices,  or  identity
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.  The
disqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.
With that said, I attach minimal security significance to the 11 medical collection
accounts  for  a  total  of  about  $14,361.  Applicant  incurrent  those  debts  for  necessary
medical  care  and  treatment  when  she  was  uninsured.  Such  indebtedness  does  not
indicate poor self-control, frivolous or irresponsible spending, living beyond her means,
or questionable judgment. On that basis, the matters in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.h through 1.q
are decided for Applicant.
Turning to the matters in mitigation, the genesis of Applicant’s financial problems
is her inconsistent employment history, which includes multiple jobs and several periods
of underemployment and unemployment. For the most part, these were circumstances
largely beyond her control.  She acted reasonably under the circumstances by seeking
work wherever she could find it, to include working in jobs below her qualifications as a
mechanical engineer. Given these circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG ¶ 20(c)
applies, and Applicant receives credit in mitigation.
Applicant has not made “a good-faith effort” to resolve the six collection accounts
stemming  from  student  loans  and  broken  apartment  leases.  Taken  together,  she  is
facing  a  small  mountain  of  debt;  about  $70,000  for  the  four  student  loan  accounts  in
collection;  and  about  $10,325  for  the  two  apartment  leases  in  collection.  Given  her
means  and  limited  financial  assets,  it  is  unlikely  that  any  of  those  debts  will  be  paid,
settled, or in a payment arrangement in the foreseeable future. Although Applicant has
faced  difficulties  since  entering  the  workforce,  she  has  simply  made  no  progress  in
repaying  her  overdue  creditors  or  otherwise  resolving  the  debts,  and  it  is  my
assessment  that  she  is  unlikely  to  do  so.  Given  these  circumstances,  the  mitigating
condition at AG ¶ 20(d) does not apply in Applicant’s favor.
Following Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to  protect
classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence
as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence  or  vice  versa.  I  also  considered  the  whole-person  concept.  I  gave  particular
consideration to the highly favorable letter of recommendation submitted on Applicant’s
behalf.  Although  Applicant  presented  some  favorable  evidence  in  mitigation,  it  was
outweighed by the unfavorable evidence.  I conclude that  she has not met her ultimate
burden  of  persuasion  to  show  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to
grant her eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
