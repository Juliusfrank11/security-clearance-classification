Applicant denied the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the
pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  43-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  pages  5
and 13.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since October of 2014. (GX
1 at page 13.) He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1999, and  achieved the
rank  of  Lieutenant  Commander  until  his  departure  from  active  duty  in  2008.  (GX  1  at
pages  19~29,  and  AppX  B.)  While  on  active  duty,  Applicant  went  to  “Justice  School,”
and was certified as “a legal officer.” He has held a security clearance since 1999. (Id,
and TR at page 39 line 19 to page 41 line 25.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a. and 1.b. Applicant failed to file both his Federal and state income tax returns,
in a timely fashion, for tax years 2012~2016. (TR at page 28 line 20 to page 37 line 25,
and at page 41 line 13 to page 48 line 20.) He was working several jobs, had some non-
life-threatening  health  issues,  and  a  romantic  break  up  with  his  “girlfriend.”  (Id.)  He
avers  that  if  he  was  due  a  refund;  he  was  not  required  to  file,  but  would  forfeit  any
refund. (TR at page 29 lines 2~21.) In light of Applicant’s education from a U.S. military
academy, coupled with his attending the Naval Justice School, I find this averment not
to be credible.
Applicant  subsequently  filed  all  of  his delinquent tax  returns  in  May  of  2018,  as
evidenced by documentation of those filings. (AppXs D, H and 24~29.) It is interesting to
note, that on his 2012 Federal income tax return (FITR) Applicant owed $1,322, and on
his 2014 FITR he owed $969. (AppX D.)
Applicant’s  current  supervisor,  prior  supervisor,  and  a  co-worker  testified  as  to
Applicant  good  character.  (TR  at  page  15  line  22  to  page  26  line  11.)  However,  his
current  supervisor  was  surprised  by  Applicant’s  averment  as  to  Applicant’s  lack  of
understanding of his responsibility to file his income tax returns. (TR at page 17 line 18
to  page  18  line  6.)  Applicant  also  submitted  a  favorable  reference  from  another  co-
worker. (AppX C at page 5.)
