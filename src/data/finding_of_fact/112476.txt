Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except ¶ 1.e. After a thorough and
careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of
fact.
Applicant  is  35  years old.  He  served  in  the military  from  2001  to 2005  and  was
honorably  discharged  in  the  paygrade  E-3.  He  attended  college  at  different  times  and
earned  an  associate’s  degree  in  2015.  He  married  in  2002  and  divorced  in  2009.  He
remarried in 2010. He has four children, ages 16, 13, 10 and 9 years old, who live with
him. He has another child from a relationship. He pays child support for this child.1
Applicant  was  employed  from  approximately  September  2015  until  May  2017,
when he was laid off. He was unemployed until August 2017, when he began work at a
car  dealership  on  commission.  He  disclosed  he  was  also  self-employed  as  a  financial
services  advisor  from  May  2017.  He  attributes  his  most  recent  unemployment  for  his
financial issues.2
Applicant’s  admissions  and  a  consolidated  credit  report  from  January  2018
corroborated the SOR allegations. In his answer to the SOR, he stated that after being
released from his management position, he was unable to make minimum payments on
his debts due to insufficient income. He also stated that when he initially opened certain
accounts, he had no intention of defaulting on them.3
In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he explained he had previously paid his bills,
showing he was financially responsible. He explained that he currently has $73 a month
to repay his delinquent debts. He intends to increase this amount to $200 in April 2019.
After January 2020 he intends to increase it to $330 and in November 2021 to $500. He
expects all of his debts to be paid by February 2025. He provided a one-page document
stating three steps on how to reduce debt. He provided another document listing his debts
with  proposed  minimum  payments  and  proposed  payoff  dates.  He  did  not  provide
evidence  that  he  has  made  any  payment  or  a  budget  showing  his  other  expenses,
income, or ability to make the payments. He explained that his plan did not provide for
potential settlement offers that would reduce the amount he would pay and expedite the

2 Items 3, 4, 5.

process. He did not mention whether his proposed plan included providing for the amount
of debt increasing due to interest.4
Applicant acknowledged the debt owed in SOR ¶ 1.a and explained it was for a
repossessed vehicle, which he purchased in 2015. His car payments were $709 a month.
When he lost his job, he could not afford the payments. He attempted to trade the vehicle
in  for  a  less  costly  one,  but  due  to  the  negative  equity,  he  could  not.  He  voluntarily
returned the vehicle and then purchased a less expensive vehicle.5
Applicant  provided  a  document  from  the  IRS  showing  that  he  was  entitled  to
$5,410  income  tax  refund.  The  IRS  involuntarily  withheld  $1,855  from  the  refund  and
applied  it  to  his  delinquent  child  support  debt  in  February  2018.  It  is  unknown  what
Applicant did with the remainder of the refund.6
Applicant  denied  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  stating  that  neither  he  nor  his  wife
recognized it. It is listed on his credit report. He did not provide evidence of any action he
may have taken to dispute it with the creditor or on his credit report.7
