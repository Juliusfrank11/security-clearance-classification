Applicant admitted both SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  55  years  old.  He  earned  bachelor’s  degree  in  1985.  He  married  in
1989 and divorced in 2011. His children from the marriage are ages 27, 23, 19, and 15
years  old.  Applicant  remarried  in  2012.  He  has  four  adult  stepchildren.  Applicant  has
worked for his current employer, a federal contractor since May 2017.1
Applicant  worked  in a foreign  country  and  was  employed  by  a foreign  company
from June 2013 until March 2017. He testified that in the past, he completed his federal
income  tax  returns  without  assistance  He  testified  it  was  difficult  to  file  his  tax  returns
when  living  in  a  foreign  country  due  to  the  foreign  tax  issues.  He  said  his  employer
provided  an  attorney  for  him,  but  he  was  not  a  competent  tax  attorney  and  did  not
complete  his  obligation.  Applicant  further  stated  he  did  not  want  to  file  his  federal  tax
returns because he knew they would be incorrect. He believed his U.S. tax debt would be
minimal  and  most  of  his  taxes  would  be  owed  to  the  foreign  country  where  he  was
working.  He  explained  that  he  was  not  able  to  get  his  attorney  to  understand  the
complexity of the issue. He also stated that he did not want to pay for a competent tax
professional because the other one was being provided by his employer.2
Applicant testified that he failed to timely file his 2013 through 2016 federal income
tax returns. He said he returned to the United States twice a year, but did not use that
opportunity  to  file  his  tax  returns.  He  did  not  seek  the  assistance  of  tax  professionals
because of anxiety over his tax situation. He stated he procrastinated and each year he
ignored the problem and told himself he would address the issues in in the future. He was
aware of his legal tax obligations. When he left employment in the foreign country and
returned to the United States in April 2017, he said he thought about filing his tax returns,
but failed to do promptly.3
Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in April 2017. He was
interviewed by a government investigator in July 2017 and his delinquent tax returns were
discussed. He completed government interrogatories in March 2018. In response to the

interrogatories,  he  provided  IRS  transcripts  for  tax  years  2013,  2014,  2015,  and  2016
verifying  he  failed  to  file  his  tax  returns  for  these  years.  In  May  2018,  he  filed  federal
income tax returns for 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. He provided an IRS document
that shows he owes $7,832 for tax year 2013. He provided a document to show he made
one payment of $500 in November 20, 2018 on that tax debt. He provided documents
confirming an agreement with the IRS to pay $500 a month. He provided IRS documents
to show he did not owe taxes for the other tax years.4
Applicant’s explanation for his failure to timely file federal income tax returns for
multiple years and his failure to pay foreign taxes was because his father passed away in
June  2013,  and  his  father-in-law  passed  away  in  October  2015.  After  each  death,  he
returned to the United States. He said these trips were unexpected expenses.5
Applicant disclosed in his SCA that he traveled for tourism to European countries
in May 2014, September 2014, March 2015, July 2015, November 2015, April 2016, July
2016, August 2016, and March 2017. Applicant’s wife provided a letter and noted these
were relatively inexpensive trips.6
Applicant  admitted  he  was  responsible  for  paying  taxes  in  the  foreign  country
where he was living. He explained that he did not want to file his U.S. federal income tax
returns because of the complexity with his foreign tax returns. He testified that he was
paying  very  little  toward  his  foreign  income  taxes  because  he  had  a  significant  child
support obligation in 2013 that he was paying. He said he owed so much money that the
United States would not issue him a passport. His ex-wife agreed to waive the support
obligation if he agreed to make certain payments, which he did.7 He testified that at the
time his foreign taxes were not being paid. He was required to budget throughout the year
so he could pay the taxes at the end of the tax year, but he failed to do so. At one point,
personnel from the foreign tax authority came to his house and made him pay 5,000£,
which he did. He continued to procrastinate and did not pay his foreign taxes. He admitted
he paid minimal foreign taxes the years he was required to pay foreign taxes.8
Applicant  testified  that  he  paid  approximately  33,000£  for  his  foreign  taxes.  His
final  two  months  of  income,  from  February  and  March  2017  before  he  returned  to  the
U.S., was seized by the foreign government. He said he had no money to live on during
this period. He went to see a new attorney in the country where he was living, who worked

7 Applicant’s child support is not an issue, except as he testified how it may impacted his ability to pay his
foreign tax debt. I have not considered any derogatory information that was not alleged for disqualifying
purposed. I may consider it when making a credibility determination, in applying mitigating conditions, and
in my whole-person analysis.

with the foreign tax authorities, so he could receive some income while living there. Once
he returned to the United States, Applicant testified he did not feel a sense of urgency to
resolve the foreign tax issues. After he received the government interrogatories, he began
pursuing resolution of his foreign tax debt.9
Applicant  testified  and  provided  a  copy  of  a  July  2018  letter  from  his  foreign
attorney who requested that Applicant provide him certain information. At the time of his
hearing, Applicant had not yet responded to the request. Part of the letter included an
accounting  of  the  tax  balance  owed  by  Applicant,  which  noted  credit  for  amounts  he
previously paid. The amount owed in dollars based on exchange rates from November
2018  is  approximately  $142,532.  In  his  post-hearing  statement,  Applicant  said  that  he
was in contact with his attorney and requested that he work out a payment agreement
with the foreign tax authority with payments beginning in January 2019.10
Applicant testified that he would propose to pay $1,000 a month for ten years to
resolve his foreign tax debt. He stated his finances are stable. Applicant’s wife provided
a character letter. She provided insight into their travels and finances when they had to
return to the Unites States due to family matters. She considers him to be a good and
devoted father.  She noted he has great respect for the law and follows the rules.11
