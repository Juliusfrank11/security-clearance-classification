Applicant  is  a  35-year-old  employee  of  a  DOD  contractor  seeking  a  security
clearance.  She  has  worked  for  her  current  employer  since  2013.  Her  highest  level  of
education is an associate’s degree. She separated from her husband in 2010 and has
an 18-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. (Item 3)
On  February  1,  2018,  Applicant  submitted  an  Electronic  Questionnaire  for
Investigations  Processing.  (Item  3)  A  subsequent  background  investigation  revealed
Applicant  had  the  following  delinquent  debts:  a  $29,169  deficiency  account  on  a
mortgage that was foreclosed in 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.a:  Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 8); a $91 debt
placed  for  collection  in  January  2012  (SOR  ¶  1.b:  Item  5  at  2;  Item  6  at  8)  and  two
medical accounts  in  the  amounts  of  $345 and  $181 placed for collection  in  December
2012 and February 2013 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d). In her response to the SOR, Applicant
admitted SOR ¶ 1.a, but denied the remaining three allegations. (Item 2)
Applicant started having financial problems in 2010 when she separated from her
husband.  He  was  unfaithful  and  eventually  went  to  jail.    The  record  is  not  clear  on
whether  her  husband  remains  incarcerated.    She  could  not  make  the  mortgage
payments without her husband’s income. Her home was foreclosed in July 2014, which
resulted in the deficiency balance alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a.
She  provided  confirmation  numbers  next  to  each  of  the  remaining  SOR
allegations.  While  it  would  have  been  better  to  have  provided  a  statement  from  the
creditor  indicating  the  debt  was  paid  in  full,  I  find  SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.d  for  Applicant,
because they are no longer on her most recent credit report. (see Item 5)   The $91 debt
alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  is  a  minimal  amount  and  does  not  raise  significant  security
concerns.  The  debt  of  most  concern  is  the  $29,169  mortgage  foreclosure  deficiency
debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a.  Applicant intends to pay this debt off when she completes
making payments towards her smaller debts.
There are several debts that were not alleged in the SOR, which Appellant paid
off.    At  least  five  delinquent  debts  were  paid  off  by  Applicant  before  the  SOR  was
issued. She appears to be systematically paying off her delinquent accounts when she
is able to do so. (Item 4; see also Items 5 and 6)
