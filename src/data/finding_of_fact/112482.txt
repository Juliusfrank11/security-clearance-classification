The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  filed  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  September  2005
which  was  discharged  in  December 2005;  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  in  June  2016  which
was  dismissed  in  September  2016;  and,  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  in  2016  which  was
dismissed  in  January  2017.  The  SOR  further  alleges  that  Applicant  was  $18,695  in
arrears on  his past-due  mortgage  loan,  and had  seven  delinquent consumer accounts
totaling  $6,387.  Applicant  admits  each  of  the  SOR  allegations.  The  bankruptcies  and
debts  are  reflected  in  records  from  the  bankruptcy  court and  Applicant’s  credit  bureau
reports  (CBR)  from  April  2019,  March  2018,  and  August  2017.  (GX  2  –  GX  7.)  His
admissions in his Answer are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  52-year-old  creative  writer  currently  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since July 2017, and periodically employed in the defense industry since 2005.
He served honorably on active duty in the U.S. Navy from October 1985  to June 2000
and in the Reserve from June 2000 until October 2005. He was briefly recalled to active
duty in 2001. Applicant received his bachelor’s degree in 1995. He and his current wife
married in 2010. Applicant was previously married from 1988 until 1999. He has three
children ages 28, 21, and 18. The 21-year-old and 18-year-old reside with Applicant and
his wife. Applicant received his first security clearance in 1985 while on active duty. His
security clearance was revoked for financial issues following his Chapter 7 bankruptcy in
approximately 2005. This is his first re-application for a security clearance. (GX 1; Tr. 28-
33; Tr. 35.)
Applicant left active duty in 2000 and joined the Reserve. He was activated from
December 2001 until June 2002. He was unemployed from June 2002 until July 2003.
This period of unemployment ultimately led to Applicant’s filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy in
September 2005. After filing, Applicant voluntarily participated in financial counseling and
regained his financial footing until 2012 when he was laid off from his federal contracting
position.  (Tr.  51.)  He  was  unemployed  between  March  2012  and  July  2012.  Applicant
was underemployed as a pizza delivery driver earning approximately $18,000 a year from
July 2012 until July 2017, when he started his current job. Initially, he worked both jobs,
but the schedule was too demanding for him to maintain it. (Tr. 27.) Applicant’s wife is
unable to work outside the home due to a medical condition. She sells handcrafted items
which sporadically produces less than $100 a month. (Tr. 39.)
Applicant purchased a house in February 2011. Following his layoff in 2012 and
the subsequent extended period of underemployment, Applicant was unable to sustain
his financial obligations. He defaulted on his mortgage loan in May 2015 and foreclosure
proceedings were subsequently started by the lender. After consulting with an attorney,
Applicant  filed  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  in  June  2016  to  prevent  losing  his  house  in
foreclosure.  He  was  unable  to  maintain  the  payments  and  his  case  was  dismissed  in
September 2016. He re-filed the bankruptcy in September 2016, but was again unable to
sustain  the  payments  and  the  case  was  dismissed  in  January  2017.  At  some  point  in
2016, Applicant and the mortgage-loan lender reached a mortgage-loan reorganization
agreement. Applicant has been paying down his mortgage-loan arrearage (SOR ¶ 1.d)
and  the  current  balance  is  approximately  $2,000.  He  has  made  timely  mortgage-loan
payments  since  reaching  the  agreement.  (GX  7.)  All  of  the  other  SOR  debts  became
delinquent between May 2012 and January 2017. (GX 5; GX 6; GX 8; GX 3; GX 4; Tr.
36-37; Tr. 41-46.)
Applicant  disputed  in  person  and  by  telephone  the  $200  cable  television  debt
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.l. and it is not listed on his April 2019 CBR. He has not been contacted
recently by any of the SOR creditors. Of the remaining SOR debts totaling $6,187, only
SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.h, totaling $1,728 are listed on his April 2019 CBR. (GX 7.)
All of Applicant’s SOR debts were incurred prior to Applicant’s current employment,
which began in July 2017. (GX 4.) Applicant lives within his means, has not incurred any
recent delinquent debts, and is able to maintain his ongoing financial obligations. He and
his wife maintain a monthly budget and timely file their tax returns. Applicant intends to
continue  to  maintain  control  of  his  finances.  (Tr.  51-53;  Tr.  57.)  He  was  sincere  and
credible while testifying.
