The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to timely file his federal
income tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.a), and that as of July 6,
2018, he owed charged-off balances of $17,381 (SOR ¶ 1.b) and $892 (SOR ¶ 1.d) to a
credit union, and collection balances of $1,121 (SOR ¶ 1.c) and $328 (SOR ¶ 1.e) to the
U.S.  government.  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR  (Item  2),  Applicant  indicated  that  his  tax
returns for tax years 2014 through 2015 have been filed and he had paid off the $1,121
debt in 2016. He admitted that he owed the credit union, but indicated that he had been
repaying the debts on a monthly basis. Applicant denied the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e based on
lack of knowledge.  After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant’s Answer to the
SOR (Item 2), and AE A, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  30  years  old  and  unmarried.  He  has  attended  college  but  has  not
earned a degree. He served honorably on active duty in the U.S. military from August 2006
to August 2012, and he held a DOD secret clearance granted to him in 2006. He was in the
active  reserve  from  October  2014  until  March  2017,  when  he  was  given  a  general
discharge under honorable conditions. He was not able to fulfill his drill service on the
scheduled dates because he was either working out of the country or attending school in a
distant state. (Items 4, 7.)
On  his  discharge  from  active  duty,  Applicant  lived  with  his  parents  and  was
unemployed for a year. From August 2013 to May 2014, he attended college full time. In
July 2014, he began working as a weapons technician for a defense contractor. (Item 4; AE
A.)  Applicant  earned  $18,341  in  wages  from  July  2014  through  December  2014.  He
allowed the April 15, 2015 deadline for filing his federal income tax return for tax year 2014
to pass without filing his tax return.1 (AE A.) He cites his focus on completing his tasks as a
1 The SOR does not allege a failure to file state income tax returns. A record of the state tax authority indicates
that Applicant does not have a filing requirement for tax years 2014 through 2017, and no tax liabilities or
pending tax assessments for those tax years. (Item 5.)
weapons technician, the difficulty in transitioning from the military to civilian life, and fear of
losing  his  new  job  as  the  reasons  why  he  “neglected  to  start  on  [his]  taxes  on  time.”
Applicant acknowledges that it was irresponsible of him to not file his return on time. (AE
A.)
In mid-September 2015, Applicant began working remotely as a weapons technician
for another company at an hourly wage of $14.50. He was paid $1,000 to assist him with
his relocation expenses. (Item 4; AE A.) While living and working outside of the United
States until May 2016, Applicant filed his federal income tax return for 2014 on April 15,
2016. On his wages of $18,341, he overpaid his federal income taxes by $1,391. The IRS
applied $1,292.94 of his tax refund to his tax liability for tax year 2013. Applicant did not file
his federal income  tax  return  for tax  year 2015  by the April 18, 2016 deadline for that
return. (Item 5; AE A.)
About six months into his new job, Applicant decided to continue his college studies
toward a degree in electrical engineering. (AE A.) In May 2016, Applicant resigned from his
job without giving the required two-week notice, and he enrolled in college in the United
States. He had to repay the $1,000 to his former employer because he did not stay in his
job for a year. (Item 4; AE A.) In June 2016, he paid two debts, of $1,121 and $125 in
government overpayments (SOR ¶ 1.c), that were in collections. He used funds from his GI
bill and student financial aid to pay the debts. (Items 2, 5-7.)
Applicant was unemployed while a full-time student from May 2016 to May 2017.
He became seriously delinquent on an auto loan that he obtained for $28,091 in November
2014 for a 2013 model-year vehicle. The loan was to be repaid at $565 a month for five
years.  The  loan  became  seriously  delinquent  in  September  2016  because  he  lacked
income to make the payments. The creditor repossessed the vehicle and sold it. A past-
due deficiency balance of $17, 984 was charged off in January 2017 (SOR ¶ 1. b). (Items
5-7.)
In May 2017, Applicant began working for a defense contractor as a maintenance
technician.  On  May  16,  2017,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire  for National Security  Positions (SF 86). He responded negatively to the
financial record inquiries, including to questions regarding whether he had failed to file or
pay federal, state, or other taxes within the last seven years; whether he had defaulted on
any loans in the last seven years; and whether he had any bills or debts turned over for
collection in the last seven years. (Item 4.)
A  check  of  Applicant’s  credit  on  July  22,  2017,  revealed  that  Applicant  owed  a
charged-off balance of $17,984 on the auto loan; that the same credit union had placed a
$1,460 charged-off balance for collection after nonpayment since January 2017 (SOR ¶
1.d);  that  a  personal  loan  had  been  charged  off  for  $2,311  in  July  2016  but  paid  in
collection (not alleged in SOR); that a $265 insurance debt had been in collection since
May  2015  (not  alleged  in  SOR);  and  that  a  $181  utility  services  debt  was  placed  for
collection in December 2015 (not alleged in SOR). (Item 7.)  Applicant had repayment
plans in place with the credit union to address his debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d. On June 9,
2017, he arranged to repay the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d, which was a personal loan taken out to
pay  living  expenses,  at  $100  a  month.  On  July  3,  2017,  Applicant  agreed  to  make
payments of $200 a month toward his auto loan deficiency. (Item 2.)
On January 9, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). When asked whether he had failed to file or pay
federal,  state,  or  other  taxes  on  time,  Applicant  indicated  that  he  had  not  yet  filed  his
federal income tax return for tax year 2016, but that he had received an extension to April
2018 from the IRS.2  When asked about any debt to the federal government, Applicant
indicated that he had paid the government creditor named in SOR ¶ 1.c. The debts arose
because of overpayments that he recalled receiving in May 2016. He explained that he
paid  the  debts  to  clear  his  credit  history  for  the  security  clearance  required  for  his
employment. He described his current financial situation as poor. He had other financial
issues that were being repaid, including the loans in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d. When confronted
about the insurance debt in collection on his credit report, Applicant indicated that he had
paid that debt in April 2017. The debt was for insurance on his repossessed vehicle. He
also  related  that,  in  April  2017,  he  had  paid  the  $2,311  defaulted  loan  in  collection.
Applicant did not recognize the $181 collection debt for utility services that was on his
credit record. Applicant was given five business days to provide documentation confirming
payment or repayment arrangements for his debts. (Item 5.) There is no evidence that he
provided evidence of payments or payment arrangements within the five days.
As of March 9, 2018, Applicant’s credit report from Equifax reflected outstanding
balances of $17,381 on his defaulted auto loan (SOR ¶ 1.b) and $892 on the personal loan
with the credit union (SOR ¶ 1.d). A government debt of $328 (SOR ¶ 1.e) from July 2017
was in collection. His credit report had not been updated to show the repayment of the debt
in SOR ¶ 1.c. No other delinquencies were on his credit report. (Item 6.)
DOHA sent interrogatories to Applicant asking in part whether he had ever failed to
file  his  federal  income  tax  returns  on  time.  On  June  18,  2018,  Applicant  responded
affirmatively and indicated that he had yet to file his federal and state income tax returns
for tax years 2015 and 2016, but that he had no outstanding federal or state tax liabilities.
Account transcripts from the IRS showed that he filed his federal income tax return for tax
year 2014 on April 15, 2016, but that he had yet to file his federal income tax returns for tax
years 2015, 2016, and 2017 as of June 12, 2018. (Item 5.)
On July 6, 2018, the DOD CAF issued the SOR to Applicant because of his failure to
timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2016 and because of
consumer credit delinquencies totaling $19,722. (Item 1.) In response to the SOR, on July
17, 2018, Applicant provided documentation from the credit union showing that he was in
compliance  with  his  repayments  on  the  loans  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.d.  He  had  made
2 Applicant did not provide any corroborating documentation to support his claim that he had an extension of
the filing deadline for tax year 2016 to April 2018, which was beyond the October 2017 extended deadline to
which he would have been entitled had he filed Form 4848 on or before the April 18, 2017 tax-filing deadline
for tax year 2016.
payments to reduce the respective loan balances to $16,181.43 and $392.34 as of July 17,
2018. Applicant provided documentation corroborating his claimed resolution of the debt in
SOR ¶1.c in 2016. Applicant denied any knowledge of the $328 government debt in SOR ¶
1.e. He asserted that his delinquent federal income tax returns for tax years 2014 through
2016 (Item 2.)
On October 15, 2018, DOHA sent Applicant a FORM in response to his request for
a decision based on the written record.3 In rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant submitted IRS
account transcripts dated August 21, 2018, which showed that he filed his federal income
tax return for tax year 2014 on April 15, 2016, but that he had not filed his federal income
tax returns as of his July 17, 2018 response to the SOR allegations. He filed his federal
income tax return for tax year 2015 on August 5, 2018, more than two years beyond the
tax-filing  deadline  of  April  18,  2016.  On  adjusted  gross  income  of  $44,280,  Applicant
underpaid his federal income taxes by $938. He filed his federal income tax return for tax
year 2016 on August 7, 2018, more than a year after the tax-filing deadline of April 18,
2017. On adjusted gross income of $15,654, he owes $365 in federal taxes for 2016. On
August 3, 2018, Applicant filed his income tax return for tax year 2017. His income tax
return was due on April 17, 2018, unless he applied for an extension of the deadline to
October 2018. There is no evidence that he filed a Form 4868 requesting an extension. On
adjusted gross income of $40,447 for tax year 2017, Applicant overpaid his federal income
taxes by $2,841. (AE A.)
Regarding his late tax filings for tax years 2015 through 2017, Applicant explained
that he could not file his income tax returns until he paid the $1,000 owed his previous
employer and he could not afford to do so:
The islands policy was for me to stay at least one year in the country to keep
the  $1,000  payment.  I  then  owed  this  amount  back  to  [his  previous
employer]. It was mainly this exact situation in filing my taxes 2015, 2016 and
2017 became a struggle. I have always filed my taxes through Turbo Tax. As
I attempted to do so the site informed me that nothing could be done to file
taxes until that debt was paid off. I was not making a sufficient amount of
income at that time, and could not afford to pay off the debt in one whole
payment.  Between  rent  and  food  it  was  difficult  to  manage  this  debt.
Between 2015 through 2017 income has been straining my ability to pay this
debt and getting the taxes filed on time.
My last resort was to talk to tax preparer [name and email omitted] and seek
advice  how  to  tackle  this  situation.  He  advised  me  after  3  years  of  not
knowing that I can indeed file all of my taxes through him without having to
pay my $1,000 dollar first. I finally completed them all. I now have a high
paying job to manage any debt now. (AE A.)
3 The FORM was sent to Applicant through an employer other than that listed on his August 2016 SF 86. No
information was provided about when Applicant changed employers or about his income with his current
employer other than his statement that he has a high-paying job. See AE A.
