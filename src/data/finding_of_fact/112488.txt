Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer, or a predecessor contractor, since April 2015. He attended college
for several years, but he has not earned a degree. He is single with one child. He has
custody of his child, and they live at his parents’ house.1
Applicant had periods of unemployment and underemployment before 2015. The
amended SOR alleges two delinquent student loans in the amounts of $36,479 (SOR ¶
1.a) and $26,204 (SOR ¶ 1.b), an unpaid judgment to a credit card provider for $5,335
(SOR  ¶  1.c),  and  Applicant’s  failure  to  file  state  and  federal  income  tax  returns  when
they  were  due  for  2017  (SOR  ¶  1.d).  However,  the  two  student  loans  are  duplicate
accounts.2
Applicant stated that the judgment was paid in early 2017 through garnishment of
his  wages.  He  provided  documentation  that  the  judgment  was  paid  and  satisfied  at
some  point  before  March  2018.  Since  May  2018,  his  pay  has  been  garnished  $451
twice a month for his student loan. He paid a total of $7,667 during that period, and he
reduced the balance from $36,479 to $30,920.3

2 Tr. at 29-30, 33-34, 43-45; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-4.
3 Tr. at 30-31, 43, 49-51; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE B, C.
Applicant filed his 2017 state and federal income tax returns in January 2019. He
is due a $1,709 refund from the IRS, and he owes his state $3, which he assures he will
pay.4
Applicant admitted that he was negligent when he failed to file his tax returns on
time. He paid debts that were not alleged in the SOR before the SOR was issued. He
stated  that  his  current  finances  are  sound,  which  is  corroborated  by  the  most  recent
credit  report  in  evidence.  He  has  a  good  job  that  enables  him  to  provide  for  his  child.
The garnishment of his student loans was recently lifted. He credibly testified that he will
continue to pay his student loans, file his tax returns on time, and maintain his financial
stability. He has not received formal financial counseling.5
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
August  2016.  He  did  not  report  any  financial  issues  on  the  questionnaire,  but  he
reported derogatory information under other questions. He credibly denied intentionally
providing  false  information  on  the  questionnaire.  He  stated  that  he  had  already  made
arrangements  to  pay  the  debt  that  resulted  in  the  judgment.  The  August  2016  credit
report listed the student loan as in deferment.6 I find that he did not intentionally provide
false information of the SF 86.
