Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 2.a, and 2.b. He
denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.d.1 (Item 3)
Applicant  is  57  years  old.  He  is  divorced  twice  and  has  two  adult  children.  He
served in the Army from 1980 to 2004, and received an honorable discharge. He held a
security clearance while in the Army. He has worked for federal contractors since 2004.
In 2014, he was granted an interim security clearance. (Item 4)
In his August 2017 SCA, Applicant stated that in June 2017 he used marijuana for
the first time  to  alleviate  arthritic  pain.  He  said  his physician  was  going  to  issue  him  a
medical certificate  to use  it,  so  he  decided to  try  it  before  that.  On  June 30, 2017,  his
employer notified him that he tested positive for marijuana on his recent drug urinalysis
and was required to enroll in a mandatory Employee Assistance Program (EAP) starting
July 6, 2017. He was placed on a leave of absence from July 3, to August 2, 2017, and
required  to  complete  some  form  of  treatment.2  He  stated  that  he  is  now  required  to
participate  in  a  five-year  drug  treatment  program,  beginning  on  July  27,  2017,  and
continuing to July 27, 2022. He explained that his employer requires him to be drug free
during those years. (Items 4, 5, 6)
During a December 2017 interview, Applicant told an investigator that on June 23,
2017, he used marijuana to relieve arthritic pain in his back. He said his doctor had offered
to  prescribe  him  a  medical  marijuana  card,  but  Applicant  refused  because  it  was
prohibited under federal law and his employer’s policies. He stated that on June 26, 2017,
he was randomly selected for a drug urinalysis. On June 30, 2017, his employer notified
him that he tested positive for marijuana and was ordered not to return to work, beginning
on July 3, 2017. He was off work for 30 days and had to take another drug urinalysis on
July 24, 2017. Those results were negative and he returned to work on August 2, 2017.
(Item 6)
1 Applicant denied that he tested positive for marijuana on June 28, 2017, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d.
He admitted that it was July 5, 2017, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e. He asserted he only tested positive once
during the June to July 2017 timeframe. There is confusion in this record as to the correct date of his positive
urinalysis in 2017. I find that the date of the positive drug screen was in June 2017, which is consistent with
the preponderance of the evidence, including his SCA, interview, and interrogatories. (Item 6)
2 There is no information describing the components of this mandatory treatment program.
On May 10, 2018, a government investigator obtained Applicant’s medical records.
The  records  documented  that  Applicant  had been  using marijuana from approximately
October 2015 until July 2017, during which time he held a security clearance. According
to the medical records, Applicant’s physician prescribed him Tramadol, and required him
to refrain from alcohol or marijuana use while using this drug. On October 14, 2015, he
tested positive for marijuana. Subsequently, Applicant acknowledged to his physician in
writing  that  he  would not  use  alcohol or marijuana  and  agreed  to random  drug  testing
ordered by his physician to confirm abstinence. Despite his promise, he tested positive
for  both  marijuana  and  alcohol  on  January  22,  2016,  and  March  22,  2016.  He  later
reported  to his physician that he  discontinued marijuana  use, but  his  subsequent drug
test in June 2017 again tested positive for marijuana. (Items 3, 7)
On June 12, 2018, Applicant completed a set of  government interrogatories. He
reported that he had used marijuana only once, on June 26, 2017. He admitted that he
failed a drug test, but stated he had no intention of using marijuana again. He submitted
a  Certificate  of  Completion  of  an  eight-hour  drug  and  alcohol  awareness  class  in  July
2017, while on his leave of absence. He wrote that he had recently taken cortisone shots
for his arthritic pain and participated in physical therapy, both of which were alleviating
his pain. (Item 6)
