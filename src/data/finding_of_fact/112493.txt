Applicant admitted the sole SOR allegation. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 34 years old. He is a high school graduate. He served in the military
from 2003 to 2012 and was honorably discharged in the paygrade E-5. He was married
from 2006 to 2007. He has no children. He has been employed since December 2014.1
Applicant disclosed on his April 2015 e-QIP that he failed to file and pay his 2012
federal income tax return. He stated: “Recently discharge[d] from the military at the time
[and]  was  unemployed  and  unable  to  pay  the  amount  owed.”2  He  estimated  he  owed
$6,000.  He  further  stated:  “Requested  reissuance  of  2012  W-2  from  DFAS3  as  I  am
unable to access, once W-2 is received taxes will be filed and amount paid.”4
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  October  2017.  He
discussed his failure to file his 2012 federal tax return. He said that he had entered his
information to an online tax program, but did not file and panicked when he found out he
might owe $6,000 in taxes. He did not have the money to pay the total amount to the IRS.
He said he subsequently lost his W-2. He attempted to obtain a new W-2. He contacted
DFAS for a copy, but had not received a response. He said he failed to contact the IRS
and  make  payment  arrangements.  He  intended  to  contact  DFAS  again  and  request  a
copy  of  the  W-2  and  file  his  2012  federal  tax  return.  He  anticipated  this  would  be
completed by April 2018.5
Applicant answered government interrogatories in March 2018. In them he stated:
“I have requested a 2012 W-2 from DFAS to ensure that any taxes owed are paid[,] but
have not received it yet. When I do[,] I will file and set a payment plan.”6
