The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal
(SOR ¶ 1.a) and state (SOR ¶ 1.b) income tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2016,
and that he owed $27,748 in past-due consumer credit debt on a total balance of $36,702,
and  $1,678  in  delinquent  property  taxes.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  not  filed  his
income  tax  returns  on  time  as  alleged,  but  indicated  that  his  returns  have  been  filed.
Applicant  admitted  the  outstanding  indebtedness  as  alleged,  and  explained  that  his
attorney has prepared a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing.  After considering the pleadings,
exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 69-year-old engineering technician, who has worked for his defense-
contractor employer since July 1969. He earned an associate’s degree in January 1983
and  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  July  1996.  He  has  never  married,  but  has  affection  for  a
godchild.  Applicant  seeks  to  retain a secret clearance that he has held throughout his
career. (GE 1; Tr. 38-40, 43.)
An ex-nephew by marriage to Applicant’s niece lived with Applicant from 2010 until
March 2018, when he was arrested for a reason not explained in the record. This nephew
abused Applicant (AE A) and took advantage of Applicant financially.1 He ran up debt on
Applicant’s credit card account in SOR ¶ 1.c, which Applicant had given him for a couple of
months  to  use  for  gasoline  expenses.  (Tr.  49.)  His  nephew  used  the  card  for  other
expenses as well. As Applicant paid down the balances, his nephew “charged it up again.”
Applicant also used the credit card for purchases. Applicant ran into trouble because he
1 Applicant endured the abuse because his nephew was custodial parent on the weekends for Applicant’s
godchild. Applicant’s godchild, who is very special to Applicant, spent the weekends at Applicant’s house when
her mother was working. (Tr. 43.)
“was actually spending the money, and then paying it off.” At some point, Applicant was
either unable or unwilling to make the payments according to the terms of his account, and
the creditor charged off a balance of $17,059 in November 2014. (Tr. 49-50.) Applicant
used another credit card (SOR ¶ 1.d) to pay for the restoration of electricity service for
some family members. (Tr. 54-55, 64.)
Applicant  did  not  file his  Federal or state income tax returns for tax years 2011
through 2016 when they were due.2 Applicant’s explanation for his non-filing is that his
nephew drank excessively and “trashed [Applicant’s] records several times.” Applicant did
not have all the records needed to file his tax returns, and he did not then know how to
obtain  them.  Apparently  because  of  the  cost  (“it  was  like $2,000 to go out and get an
accountant to pull the—to be able to file for the 2011, the 2012 [tax years]”), Applicant did
not  seek  professional assistance. He rationalized that he had already paid his income
taxes  because  his  income  tax  withholdings  were  more  than  sufficient  to  cover  his  tax
liabilities. (Tr. 33-34, 36, 41-44.)
To renew his security clearance eligibility, Applicant completed and certified to the
accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on January 13, 2016.
He responded affirmatively to a financial-record inquiry concerning whether he had failed to
file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance in the last
seven years. He disclosed that he had not filed his Federal or state income tax returns for
tax years 2011 through 2014. He estimated his tax liabilities at $1,200 per year for those
tax years and indicated that he was working with a certified public accountant to prepare
and  file  his delinquent  tax  returns.  In response to inquiries concerning delinquency on
routine accounts, Applicant disclosed that he owed $2,885 in bank-overdraft fees (SOR ¶
1.f), and $16,000 (SOR ¶ 1.c) and $2,000 (SOR ¶ 1.g) in past-due credit-card debt. He
explained that he was working with a credit counselor “to develop a sustainable plan to
resolve [his] deficiencies.” (GE 1.)
As  of  February  9,  2016,  Applicant’s  accounts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.g  had  been
charged off and were in collection for $17,059 and $1,840. His bank-overdraft account
(SOR  ¶  1.f)  had  been  charged  off  for  $2,885  in  July  2013,  and  he  owed  an  accrued
balance of $3,464. Applicant was also 60 days past due on a loan balance of $3,070 for an
automobile redeemed after repossession. He was making payments according to terms
acceptable to his creditors on credit cards with balances of $15,767 and $9,551 (SOR ¶
1.d). A line of credit for $1,000 with a credit union was current with a $938 balance (SOR ¶
1.i). (GE 3.)
In  May  2017,  Applicant  consulted  with  an  attorney  about  filing  a  Chapter  13
bankruptcy petition. The attorney advised Applicant on June 13, 2017, that he was not able
to  represent  him  (AE  C),  apparently because the attorney did not know enough about
Applicant’s tax situation. (Tr. 34-35, 42.)
Applicant consulted with another attorney (attorney X), who advised him to obtain
his account transcripts from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (AE B; Tr. 34-35.) After
2 Applicant works in a state that collects taxes on non-residents that earn income in the state.
obtaining  the  documents  needed  to  prepare  his delinquent  tax  returns,  Applicant  then
consulted  with  an  enrolled  tax  agent,  who  prepared  his  Federal  and  state  income  tax
returns for tax years 2012 through 2015 on September 13, 2017, and for tax years 2011
and 2016 on October 16, 2017.3 (AEs E-J.) On adjusted gross income of $166,415 for tax
year 2011, he owed the IRS $4,425 and the state $86. (AE E.) On adjusted gross income
of $137,338 for tax year 2012, he owed the IRS $2,101. He expected a refund of $32 in
state taxes. (AE F.) On adjusted gross income of $112,164 for tax year 2013, he overpaid
his Federal taxes by $1,595 and his state income taxes by $176. (AE G.) On adjusted
gross  income  of  $98,014  for  tax  year  2014,  he  overpaid  his  Federal  income  taxes  by
$1,530 and his state income taxes by $207. (AE H.) On adjusted gross income of $83,922
for tax year 2015, he expected a Federal income tax refund of $1,671 and a state income
tax refund of $218. (AE I.) On adjusted gross income of $90,820  for tax year 2016, he
overpaid his Federal income taxes by $1,987 and his state income taxes by $219.4 (AE J.)
Applicant incurred tax preparation fees of $365 for his 2014 tax returns (AE H), $319 for his
2015 tax returns (AE I), and $1,987 for his 2016 tax returns (AE J). Applicant understands
that he forfeited his tax refunds for those tax years where his returns were filed more than
three years after the returns were first due. (Tr. 35.) Applicant testified that he returned a
tax refund check to the IRS and had it applied to his Federal tax liabilities, which because
of assessed penalties and likely also interest totaled $9,000 to $10,000 as of September
2018. He testified that he was making payments of $100 a month to the IRS. (Tr. 46-47.) At
Applicant’s  request,  I  held  the  record  open  after  the  hearing  for  him  to  document  his
Federal tax balance and his payments to the IRS. No documents were received.
Applicant had the same tax agent prepare his Federal and state income tax returns
for tax year 2017. She completed the returns on September 17, 2018. On adjusted gross
income of $91,189,5 he expected refunds of $1,873 from the IRS and $218 from the state.
He incurred fees totaling $473 for the tax preparation. (AE K.)
As of April 2018, Applicant had made no progress toward resolving his delinquent
consumer-credit accounts. He owed charged-off credit-card balances of $17,059 (SOR ¶
1.c) and $1,840 (SOR ¶ 1.g). In December 2017, the credit union identified in SOR ¶ 1.d
3 Both the IRS and the state allow for a six-month extension of the tax deadline, which was April 18, 2017, for
tax year 2016. However, there is no evidence that Applicant filed for extensions by the April 18, 2017 tax
deadline. With his income tax returns prepared for tax year 2016 on October 16, 2017, Applicant was advised
that if he had filed for an extension, the return must be filed by October 15 and that any balance due had to be
paid by April 18, 2017, to avoid penalties and interest. (AE J.)
4 Applicant’s belatedly-filed income tax returns show that his adjusted gross income has routinely exceeded his
wage income primarily because of pension income. His wages for tax year 2011 were $67,964, and he had
pension income of $97,977. (AE E.) His wages for tax year 2012 were $77,092, and his pension income was
$57,425. (AE F.) His wages for tax year 2013 were $87,769, and his taxable pension income was $24,161.
(AE G.) His wages for tax year 2014 declined to $75,729, and his pension income was $19,163. (AE H.) His
wages for tax year 2015 further declined to $68,757, and his pension income was $14,773. (AE I.) His wages
for tax year 2016 increased to $76,083, and his pension income was $14,681. (AE J.) Applicant did not explain
the source(s) of his pension income. He is of age to collect Social Security income, but Social Security income
is not included in gross income. He admitted at his hearing that he had taken individual retirement account
distributions to pay bills. (Tr. 66.)
5Applicant’s wage income for 2017 was $76,333, and his pension income was $13,960. (AE K.)
charged  off  his  account  for  $8,801.  His  account  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  had  been  placed  for
collection in May 2016 for $3,476. (Tr. 55-56.) He owed a charged-off balance of $3,464 on
an overdraft account (SOR ¶ 1.f) and $1,305 on a charged-off automobile loan (SOR ¶ 1.h)
obtained in May 2016. His line of credit in SOR ¶ 1.i was an overdraft account attached to
a checking account. It was $60 past due on a balance of $957 (SOR ¶ 1.i). (GE 2.)
As of September 18, 2018, attorney X was in the process of preparing a Chapter 13
bankruptcy petition for Applicant to resolve his delinquent debts. Attorney X attests that
Applicant  was  fully  cooperative  and  diligent  in  providing  the  documentation  needed  to
complete  the  petition.  (AE  B.)  Other  evidence  indicates  that  the  delay  in  filing  for
bankruptcy  was  caused  in  part  by  Applicant  not  following  up  to  ensure  that  he  was
receiving correspondence from attorney X’s office. When asked about the delay in filing his
bankruptcy petition, Applicant responded:
A couple months ago, I was like—I haven’t figure out, and, you know—and
what they did were sending me and email. I didn’t get anything in the—and it
was so. It was so hot that I really was just going home. I know it doesn’t
sound right, but I was just going home after work. I did stop in, and I was
using the other email account . . . and that’s what they were—what [name
omitted] was messaging me on, and so we got everything squared away. (Tr.
71.)
Applicant wants his creditors to be “made whole.” (Tr. 36, 51.) He intends to include
the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.e on his bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 52, 56.) Sometime during
the week preceding his security-clearance hearing, the creditor owed the debts in SOR ¶¶
1.d and 1.i offered to accept less than his balances to settle the debts. Applicant did not
recall the settlement amounts, but he plans to pay them. Regarding the overdraft debt in
SOR ¶ 1.f, Applicant testified that he “got in trouble” after the bank starting charging $60 to
$70 a month against the reserve credit attached to the account. He did not look at his
statements. (Tr. 58.) He testified that it will be paid. (Tr. 59.) As for the $1,000 credit line in
SOR ¶ 1.g, he similarly had made no payments toward the debt, but indicated that it will be
paid. (Tr. 60.) Applicant incurred the $1,305 vehicle debt in SOR ¶ 1.h when he totaled the
car in a weather-related accident in early 2017 and lacked gap insurance. He was forced to
rent a car for eight to nine months and did not pay the balance remaining on his car loan.
(Tr. 60-63.)
Applicant does not dispute that he owes delinquent property taxes of $1,678 for his
home, although he does not understand why the debt was not paid because the bank was
withdrawing funds to pay his property taxes. (Tr. 64-65.) He has a mortgage on his home
that he obtained in September 2003 for $79,800. As of February 2018, his home loan was
rated as current with a $58,468 balance, although it had been delinquent in May 2017 and
July 2017. (GE 2.) His monthly mortgage payment is $586. He has a car payment of $480
per month for a 2017 model-year vehicle. He no longer provides any financial support for
anyone else. He has one open credit-card account that has a balance of almost $15,000.
He is current on his payments. Applicant has a total of about $1,000 in his savings and
checking accounts. (Tr. 67-70.)
Applicant  earns  $38  an  hour  in  his  defense-contractor  job.  He  has  taken
withdrawals from an individual retirement account to pay some of his bills. He exhausted
that asset so he no longer has that source of income available to him. (Tr. 66-67.)
