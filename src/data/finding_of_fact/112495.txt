In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through
1.f, and 1.j. (HE 3) He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant  is  57  years  old,  and  he  has  been  employed  by  various  defense
contractors since 1996. (Tr. 6, 8; GE 1) He is currently a logistician. (Tr. 8) He has no
periods of unemployment over the previous 22 years. (Tr. 8) In 1980, he graduated from
high  school,  and  in  2008,  he  received  an  associate’s  degree.  (Tr.  6)  He  served  in  the
Marine  Corps  from  1980  to  1996.  (Tr.  7)  He  received  a  medical  discharge.  (Tr.  7)  He
received a 60 percent disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). (Tr.
7-8) He has been married four times, and his most recent marriage was in 2012. (Tr. 8)
His three children were born in 1980, 1981, and 1990. (Tr. 9)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s  annual  salary  is  $92,000.  (Tr.  18)  He  has  held  a  security  clearance
since 1983. (Tr. 19-20) In 2013, his spouse lost her job. (Tr. 21) Her salary was about
$40,000  annually.  (Tr.  21)  From  2014  to  2016,  she  had  14  surgeries  to  her  leg,  and
Applicant  had  health  insurance.  (Tr.  22)  His  spouse  was  unable  to  work,  and  they  fell
behind on their mortgage and some of their other bills. (Tr. 22) Starting in mid-2017, his
spouse began receiving about $1,000 monthly in disability payments. (Tr. 23, 43) When
her  disability payments  started,  she  also  received  about  $32,000  in  disability  pay  as a
lump  sum,  and  those  funds  were  used  to  pay  some  debts.  (Tr.  43)  She  has  not  been
employed outside their home since 2014. (Tr. 23)
In 2017, Applicant spent $1,700 to purchase furniture. (Tr. 25) In 2018, Applicant
purchased  two  used  vehicles  and financed $19,000 for  one and  $17,000 for  the  other
vehicle. (Tr. 24) In 2018, he borrowed $2,000 against his motorcycle to pay their rent. (Tr.
25) When Applicant’s spouse received the $32,000 lump sum disability payment in mid-
2017, he did not use the funds from the lump sum disability payment to pay his delinquent
tax debt because the tax debt was “out of sight, out of mind” at that time. (Tr. 43)
Applicant’s SOR alleges the following financial issues:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for
tax years 2014 through 2016. When he completed his January 9, 2017 SCA, he explained
that he had not filed his tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016, and he intended
to file them in 2017. (GE 1) Actually, he failed to timely file his federal income tax returns
for tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2017. (Tr. 28; AE A) His federal income
tax returns were timely filed for tax years 2013 and 2016. (AE A) Currently, he does not
owe federal taxes for tax years 2010 through 2013, and he resolved the federal income
tax debt for those four years through a payment plan in 2014. (Tr. 34) He owes about
$6,000 of federal  income taxes for  tax  years 2015  and  2016,  and he  does  not  have  a
payment plan to resolve this tax debt. (Tr. 33-34; AE A) His tax refunds for tax years 2017
and 2018 will be sufficient to fully resolve his delinquent federal income tax debt. (AE A

tax year 2011. (AE B at 26-27) His IRS Wage and Income Transcript shows income information and some
deductions. It does not show when his federal income tax return was filed or whether any additional taxes

SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant failed to timely file his state income tax returns for tax
years 2010 through 2013. He said he filed his state tax returns for tax years 2010 through
2013, in 2014. (Tr. 26) He filed his state tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016,
in 2017. (Tr. 26-27) At the time of his hearing, he had not yet filed his state tax returns for
tax year 2017. (Tr. 27) He may have owed about $1,500 for tax years 2010 through 2013,
and he paid that debt. (Tr. 32) He started a payment plan for tax years 2014, 2015, and
2016; however, he was unable to complete it because of medical bills for his spouse’s
surgeries. (Tr. 32) He believed he had a state tax lien for about $1,100, and he paid it.
(Tr. 31, 33)
Applicant said he did not have the funds to pay his taxes, and he decided to “wait
three years and then take care of it.” (Tr. 29) He acknowledged this was not the correct
approach for handling taxes. (Tr. 29) He promised to call the state tax authority the day
after his hearing to request supporting documentation and to provide the information to
Department Counsel. (Tr. 31, 33) He was unsure about what tax documentation he had
at home. (Tr. 35)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  Applicant  had  a  delinquent  mortgage  account  that  went  into
foreclosure. In 2007, he purchased a residence and financed about $154,000. (Tr. 36)
The purchase of the residence was financed with a loan from the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA),8 and repayment was guaranteed by the VA. (Tr. 37-38; GE 2-4) In July 2015,
he began to fall behind on his mortgage payments. (Tr. 36) In February 2016, he stopped
making  payments.  (Tr.  36)  His  credit  reports  show  a  zero  balance,  and  the  debt  is
resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges an account placed for collection for $740. Applicant said the
debt was in a payment plan, and Applicant agreed to provide proof of the payment plan
and payments after his hearing. (Tr. 38)
8 The VA loan guarantee is as follows: “For loans between $45,000 and $144,000, the minimum
guaranty  amount  is  $22,500,  with  a  maximum  guaranty,  of  up  to  40  percent  of  the  loan  up  to  $36,000,
subject to the amount of entitlement a veteran has available.” As to whether the VA loss on a loan must be
repaid, the VA explains:
Must the loan be repaid?
Yes.  A  VA  guaranteed  loan  is  not  a  gift.  It  must  be  repaid,  just  as  you  must  repay  any
money you borrow. The VA guaranty, which protects the lender against loss, encourages
the lender to make a loan with terms favorable to the veteran. But if you fail to make the
payments you agreed to make, you may lose your home through foreclosure, and you and
your family would probably lose all the time and money you had invested in it. If the lender
does take a loss, VA must pay the guaranty to the lender, and the amount paid by VA must
be  repaid  by  you.  If  your  loan  closed  on  or  after  January  1,  1990,  you  will  owe  the
Government in the event of a default only if there was fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith
on  your  part.  Factsheet  VAP  26-4
