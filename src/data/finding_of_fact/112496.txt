The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in
or about December 2008 that was dismissed in or about December 2008 (SOR ¶ 1.a), and
that, as of May 8, 2018, she owed collection debts totaling $26,422 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.m).
Under  Guideline  E,  Applicant  is  alleged  to  have  deliberately  falsified  her  April  2016
Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) by responding negatively
to inquiries concerning any financial delinquency on routine accounts  in the last seven
years (SOR ¶ 2.a). In her SOR response, she admitted each of the alleged debts, except
for a $71 cable service debt (SOR ¶ 1.m). She indicated that the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and
1.g-1.h are student loans under a repayment plan and that an $81 insurance debt (SOR ¶
1.l) had been paid. As for the alleged falsification of her security clearance application,
Applicant  responded,  “Hit  wrong  button.  I  admit.”  In  an  attached  statement,  she  listed
several circumstances that compromised her finances. After considering the pleadings,
exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 57-year-old defense contractor employee seeking a DOD security
clearance.  Separated  from  her  husband  since  June  1997,  Applicant  has  been  in  a
cohabitant relationship since September 2014, with the exception of a few months in the
spring of 2016. Applicant served on active duty in a branch of the United States military
from  March  1996  to  December  1999.  She  has  worked  for  her  current  employer  since
August 2012. (Items 3, 8.)
Applicant  earned  an  associate’s degree  at  a  technical  institute from  September
2003 to August 2005. She pursued her bachelor’s degree from August 2006 to June 2008,
while working full time as a warehouse manager for a packaging company from March
2005 to August 2012. Applicant obtained a combination of federal and private student
loans to pay for her education. (Items 4-8.)
Applicant became delinquent on her car and mortgage loan payments when her
annual income was $33,676 in 2006 and $35,234 in 2007. (Items 4, 8.) In December 2008,
Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. She owed $143,892 on her mortgage, and
her home was valued at approximately $135,000. She owed $27,847 on a loan for a 2007
model-year vehicle. She listed, as unsecured nonpriority claims, $25,391 in consumer-
credit debts and $61,606 in student loan debts, including $8,287 in federal student loans.
Applicant reported monthly net income of $680 after expenses. Her bankruptcy case was
confirmed in February 2009, with unsecured claims to receive 10% of  what she owed.
Payments of $632 per month were made by payroll deduction from February 2009 to July
2009. In June 2009, Applicant moved to amend her bankruptcy to have all of her student
loans paid outside her plan, and to increase her monthly payments under the plan to $720
a month. Her pay was garnished at $332 every two weeks from mid-July 2009 through
June  2010.  As  of  June  22,  2010,  she  had  paid  $12,695  under  the  bankruptcy  plan.
Applicant made no payments from July 2010 through September 2010, and a motion to
show cause for the $2,160 arrearage was filed in October 2010. In late December 27,
2010, her Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed for failure to file the necessary documents
to  convert  her  bankruptcy  to  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy.  (Item  4.)  Appellant  provided  no
explanation for her failure to see the bankruptcy process through to completion.
In August 2012, Applicant was involuntarily terminated from her employment as a
warehouse  manager  over  how  she  handled  a  sexual  harassment  issue  involving  a
temporary  employee.  (Item  8.)  Applicant  began  working  for  her  current  employer  that
month. (Item 3.) In early 2014, three of her private student loans, with balances of $13,297,
$3,372, and $3,227, were charged off for nonpayment. As of March 2015, Applicant was
past due on 11 other student loans totaling $40,727. (Item 5.)
In approximately February 2016, Applicant took another position with her employer,
which  required  a  relocation  to  her  present  locale.  (Items  3,  8.)  She  took  the  position
because of the higher pay. Her moving costs, which are not in evidence, were not covered
by her employer. (Item 3.) In March 2016, Applicant obtained a car loan for $33,694, to be
repaid at $691 a month for 72 months. (Item 6.)
Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National
Security  Positions  (SF  86)  incorporated  within  an  e-QIP  on  April  14,  2016.  Applicant
responded negatively to all of the financial record inquiries, including whether, in the past
seven years, she had defaulted on any loan; had bills or debts turned over for collection;
had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as
agreed;  had  her  wages  garnished  for  any  reason;  or  she  had  been  over  120  days
delinquent on any debts. She also answered “No” to whether she was currently over 120
days delinquent on any debt. (Item 3.)
As of November 16, 2016, Applicant had several delinquent accounts on her credit
record. The three private student loans charged off in 2014 were in collection for $13,332
(SOR ¶ 1.g), $3,235 (SOR ¶ 1.b), and $3,381 (SOR ¶ 1.h). Seven other debts were also in
collection: a $175 online education debt from January 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.k); an $81 insurance
debt from February 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.l); a $518 medical debt from November 2015 (SOR ¶
1.j); two debts from 2015 owed a former landlord of $2,344 (SOR ¶ 1.c, likely duplicated in
SOR ¶ 1.i based on the available credit reports) and $875 (SOR ¶ 1.d); a $73 insurance
debt placed in October 2016 (not alleged); and a $71 cable services debt from June 2015
(SOR ¶ 1.m). The 11 student loans that had been more than five payments past due in the
spring of 2015 had been transferred to a federal loan servicer in July 2015. As of October
2016, the loan servicer was reporting an $81,212 balance in deferment.  Applicant was
making timely payments on five credit-card accounts with balances totaling $3,091 and on
her car loan obtained in March 2016. (Item 6.)
On June 21, 2016, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  Applicant  admitted  that  she  should  have
answered “Yes” on her SF 86 to whether her wages had been garnished for any reason in
the last seven years. She explained that her wages had been garnished from July 2014 to
July 2015 at $485 a month to catch up on her student loans. As for her failure to disclose
any delinquencies on her SF 86, Applicant stated that she had not paid attention to the
questions on her SF 86. Applicant claimed to not recall any further details about her debts.
However, when confronted about the charged-off student loan accounts, she indicated that
the accounts became delinquent because she forgot to apply for continued deferments.
She  explained  that  she  was  making  payments  of  $16.75  per  month  toward  her
consolidated  student  loans.  Applicant  denied  knowing  about  any  of  the  outstanding
collection debts on her credit record, but indicated that she would examine her credit report
and follow up with the creditors. When asked about her Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which was
outside the scope of her SF 86, Applicant indicated that it was dismissed in December
2010  after  she  made  two  years  of  payments  to  satisfy  the  terms.  She  described  her
financial situation as gradually improving and presently in great shape. (Item 8.)
A check of Applicant’s credit in March 2018 revealed new collection debts for cable
services from 2017 for $244 and $72 (SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f).  Her student loans with the
federal loan servicer were in forbearance, with a balance of $81,265, as she continued to
take on new debt. In April 2017, Applicant obtained an unsecured loan for $5,400 to be
repaid at $237 per month. In May 2017, she obtained a secured loan for $35,298, to be
repaid at $896 per month.  Applicant’s credit report also revealed that she had opened
several new credit card accounts since her subject interview. As of March 2018, she was
making timely payments on $5,960 in credit card debts. (Item 5.)
On  May  8,  2018,  the  DOD  CAF  issued  an  SOR  to  Applicant  because  of  her
dismissed bankruptcy and the collection debts on her record, including the three charged-
off student loans, and because of her failure to disclose any past-due debts on her SF 86.
(Item 1.)   In June 2018, Applicant refinanced an unsecured loan for $1,600, to be repaid at
$311 a month. By November 2018, she was past due $643 on that loan; $237 on the April
2017 unsecured loan; $322 on a credit card obtained in January 2016; and $170 on a
credit  card  obtained  in  March  2018.  The  outstanding  balance  of  her  deferred  federal
student loans had increased to $91,927. Applicant was making timely payments on the
$35,298 secured loan (balance $29,936) and on 14 credit cards (balances totaling $8,609),
including on a new credit card account opened in August 2018 with a $729 balance. She
had opened more than ten new credit card accounts since June 2016. (Item 7.)
In response to the SOR allegations, Applicant provided documentation from  the
entity collecting her charged-off student loans in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.g, and 1.h, which showed
that she entered into agreements in May 2018 for automatic repayment of the $3,235 loan
(SOR ¶ 1.b) at almost $81 a month for 24 months; of the $13,332 loan (SOR ¶ 1.g) at $100
per month for six months; and of the $3,381 loan (SOR ¶ 1.h) at $50 per month for six
months. She provided proof of an $81 payment to satisfy the insurance debt in SOR ¶1.l.
Applicant explained that she never started taking classes at the university allegedly owed
$175 (SOR ¶ 1.k). She disputed the cable services debt in SOR ¶ 1.m for $71, stating that
she never had service with the creditor. She attributed her debts to having to care for her
disabled sister since 1999, who receives only $7,000 in Social Security income a year; to
taking in her girlfriend’s daughter and six-month old baby; to taking on car loan payments
for her girlfriend’s daughter who then wrecked the car; and to incurring $3,000 in veterinary
expenses  on  credit  for  her  dog  in  April  2018.  She  indicated,  with  no  corroborating
documentation, that she pays her sister’s property taxes and electricity bills, and pays to
repair  or  replace  items  that  break  in  her  sister’s  home.  Applicant  explained  that  the
apartment debts were from early termination of her lease due to “unfit living conditions,”
although she also claimed that she was let out of the lease. About her failure to list any
delinquencies on her April 2016 SF 86, Applicant stated:
Did I click the wrong button about if I had debt etc., sure maybe. That was
over  two  years  ago.  Those  forms  are  so  extensive  you  almost  need  an
attorney with you to fill them out correctly. (Item 2.)
In the FORM, the Government argued that Applicant’s explanation for the SF 86
omission of any delinquencies is not plausible, given her disclosure during her subject
interview that her wages had been garnished for her student loans. Additionally, if she hit
the wrong button, she had an opportunity to add additional comments on her SF 86 and did
not do so.
In her rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant indicated about her SF 86 response: “People
make mistakes and yes, I guess I hit the wrong button on the form. I was at work at and
probably should have taken it home to complete.” She asserted she did not know that she
“would  have  to  remember every  facet  of  [her]  life  so  that  [she]  could  answer all  these
questions about it.” Applicant provided more information but not the expense figures for
assistance provided for her sister, for whom she provides some food and pays her property
taxes, or for her girlfriend’s daughter. Applicant indicated that she and her girlfriend used
their vacation time and money to bring her girlfriend’s daughter and child to live with them.
They pay the child’s childcare expenses and have incurred an increase in food and utility
expenses. As the main financial provider in the household, Applicant has been paying on
the car loan for the vehicle purchased for her girlfriend’s daughter, who had begun working
but then became pregnant, and with two children cannot take over the payments. Applicant
submits that she will likely lose her job if her clearance eligibility is denied, which would
cause a financial hardship, not only for her, but also for those financially dependent on her
income. Applicant indicated that she has just recently been able to save some money,
which has alleviated some of the stress of living from paycheck to paycheck.  (AE A.)
Applicant had enjoyed her work with her employer before her employer apparently
reassigned  her  to  other  duties.  She  indicated  that  she  spent  three  years  improving
processes at work and acquired her bachelor’s degree and “a green belt in Six Sigma” for
her employment. (AE A.)
