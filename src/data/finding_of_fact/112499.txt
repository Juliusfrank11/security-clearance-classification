Applicant  is  45  years old  and  married  with  two  biological  children  and  a  grown
step-child. He has an associate’s degree, and since November 2015, Applicant has been
employed by a federal contractor. He reported periods of unemployment from November
2007 to June 2010, while he attended school, and another from February to June 2002.
Applicant is seeking to obtain eligibility to occupy a position of public trust, because his

4 See generally ISCR Case No. 12-10933 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2016) (In a concurring opinion, Judge Ra’anan
notes the historical concern about reports of investigation in that they were considered by some to present
a  heightened  problem  in  providing  due  process.  Judge  Ra’anan  raises  a  number  of  pertinent  questions
about using an unauthenticated ROI in a non-hearing case with a pro se applicant.).
sponsor  is  the  Defense  Health  Agency.  Eligibility  is  necessary  because  a  job  with  his
sponsor would involve access to sensitive but unclassified information.5
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged 13 delinquent debts totaling about $46,928,
made up of $32,919 in consumer debt and about $14,032 in student loan debt.6 Applicant
admitted all of those debts.7 Four attachments to Applicant’s answer documented that he
had resolved four SOR debts. Those debts are SOR ¶¶ 1. i, j, k, and l ($548, $430, $410,
and $350, respectively, totaling $1,738).8
The  status  of  Applicant’s  delinquent  student  loans  warrants  discussion,  as  that
status is unclear. SOR ¶¶ 1. c, d, and g alleged three delinquent student loans ($6,841,
5,809, and $1,362, respectively, totaling $14,012). One of the attachments to Applicant’s
answer notified Applicant on March 12, 2018, that his student loans had been assigned
to a collection agency. That attachment set forth a plan whereby Applicant would arrange
for  automatic  withdrawals  of  $5.00  per  month  to  be  made  beginning  March  15,  2018,
through  November  15,  2018.  As  of  March  12,  2018,  the  current  balance  (including
interest,  fees,  and  costs)  was  $28,250.9  It  is  unclear  which  of  the  student  loans  this
arrangement  addressed,  or  whether  this  was  a  consolidation  of  those  three  loans.  In
addition, Applicant submitted no documentation showing that he adhered to that plan.
Putting aside the student loans and the four SOR debts that Applicant has resolved
(totaling $15,750), there remains $31,178 of unresolved delinquent debts. Those debts
remain unresolved as recently as April 3, 2018.10
