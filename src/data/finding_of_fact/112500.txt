Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant filed Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in
April 2015 and was dismissed in August 2016 for failure to make payments, and has 14
delinquent  accounts  totaling  $179,408  including  a  Federal  tax  debt  of  $26,376.  In  his
Answer, Applicant admits each of the allegations and offers explanations for his debts.
The delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant’s credit bureau reports (CBR) from April
2018 and May 2017, disclosed on his e-QIP, and discussed during his personal subject
interview (PSI). (GX 5; GX 4; GX 3; GX 3.) Details concerning the Chapter 13 Bankruptcy
are reflected in bankruptcy court records. (GX 6.) Applicant’s admissions are incorporated
in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  57-year-old  program  manager  currently  working  for  a  defense
contractor since 1984. He received his bachelor’s degree in 1984. He married in 1979
and divorced in 2015. He was first granted a security clearance in 2006. (GX 2; GX 3.)
Applicant  states that he filed Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in April 2015 due to the costs
of  a  contested  divorce,  including  legal  expenses,  and  the  impact  that  the  loss  of  his
spouse’s income had on his ability to maintain his monthly financial obligations.  (GX 3.)
Applicant began making bankruptcy plan payments in May 2015, but later fell behind on
his payments. In July 2016, the trustee filed a motion for dismissal for noncompliance with
the  payments  and,  despite  Applicant’s  objection,  the  judge  dismissed  the  bankruptcy.
Applicant filed a motion to reconsider the order of dismissal, the motion was denied, and
the  order  dismissing  the  bankruptcy  for  noncompliance  with  the  agreed  payment  plan
became final in August 2016. (GX 6.)
However, in his PSI, Applicant stated that he withdrew his bankruptcy in August
2016 to obtain a mortgage-loan modification. Applicant stated in his Answer, “I voluntarily
suspended the Chapter 13 Bankruptcy plan on the advice of my lawyer until I could get a
first mortgage loan modification plan approved.”
In his Answer, Applicant asserts that he is on an approved IRS payment plan for
his $26,376 delinquent tax debt. (SOR ¶ 1.b.) Applicant also states that he settled the
$1,593 judgment (SOR ¶ 1.c). He did not submit any documentation in support of these
assertions.
1  The  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA)  transmittal  letter  is  dated  June  1,  2018,  and
Applicant’s receipt is dated June 14, 2018. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30
days after receiving it to submit information.  The DOHA transmittal letter and receipt are appended to the
record as Administrative Exhibit 1.
Applicant  was  granted  the  mortgage-loan  modification  in  August  2016,  and  his
monthly payments are approximately $3,300. However, his April 2018 CBR shows a past-
due balance of $3,335 (SOR ¶ 1.d). (GX 3.)
During his PSI, Applicant stated his intention of refiling Chapter 13 Bankruptcy to
resolve all his outstanding delinquent accounts no later than June 2018. In his May 2018
Answer,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.e  through  1.o,  stating  that  the  debts  would  be
resolved through refiling Chapter 13 Bankruptcy at the direction of his attorney. Applicant
did not submit any evidence of refiling Chapter 13 Bankruptcy or any other evidence of
efforts to resolve his debts.
Applicant  stated  during  his  PSI  that  he  has  not  participated  in  any  financial
counseling, nor has he been advised to do so. However, he was required to complete an
online  financial-counseling  course  as  a  condition  of  participating  in  a  Chapter  13
Bankruptcy. He categorized his financial situation as “poor.”
