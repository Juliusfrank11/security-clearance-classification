The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to file, as required, her
Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.a). Applicant
admitted the allegation, but indicated that she had completed her tax returns for tax year
2014 as of May 29, 2018. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 65-year-old widow with a 29-year-old son, who has had mental-health
issues since he was a young child.  Her son lives with her, and he has  Social Security
disability income. Applicant has a bachelor’s degree awarded in June 1982. She spent
most of her career in the commercial sector. In June 2015, she lost her employment of 33
years when she was laid off during a reduction-in-force. She was unemployed until August
2016, when she began working in the defense industry as a technical content manager for
her current employer. (GEs 1, 3; Tr. 47, 50-51.)
Applicant did not file her Federal and state income tax returns when they were due
for tax years 2013 and 2014. She filed for an extension to October 2014 to file her income
tax returns for tax year 2013. Shortly before the deadline, her son was hospitalized for six
weeks from October 2014 to November 2014. Insurance claims show that the institutional
provider  filed  medical  claims  with  Applicant’s  then  insurer  for  $18,084  for  her  son  on
October 14, 2014, and for $18,084 on November 1, 2014. Applicant had medical issues of
her own from January 2014 through May 2015. (AE D.) She did not file her tax returns for
2013, but paid the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) an estimated tax liability of $462. When
her Federal and state income tax returns for 2014 were due in 2015, she attempted to file
for an extension using tax software but was unsuccessful because she had not filed her
income tax returns for 2013. She made a Federal tax payment of $400 for tax year 2014 at
the tax deadline without submitting her tax return. (GE 2; AE E; Tr. 40-42.)
On  July  28,  2016,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) for a DOD security clearance needed
for access to military bases without an escort. (Tr. 45.) In response  to financial record
inquiries concerning whether she had failed to file or pay any Federal, state, or other taxes,
Applicant indicated that she had failed to file state income taxes for 2013, but that she had
satisfied a tax assessment of $196 in May 2016. (GE 1.)
On September 26, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). She volunteered that she prepares and files
her income tax returns, and that she failed to file her Federal and state income tax returns
for tax year 2013. She asserted that she paid a $500 late filing fee, but had not yet filed her
returns for 2013. She denied any intention to evade taxes and attributed her failure to file to
procrastination; to having to locate some paperwork needed for her tax returns for tax year
2013; and to feeling overwhelmed at times about filing her tax returns. Applicant stated that
she had filed her returns for subsequent tax years. She explained that she was considering
hiring a professional accountant to file her tax returns for 2013 and all income tax returns
due in the future. (GE 3.) She did not recall at the time that she had also not filed her
income tax returns for tax year 2014. (Tr. 40.)
On October 25, 2017, Applicant was re-interviewed by telephone. She admitted she
had not yet filed her delinquent Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013.
She clarified that she paid fees of $500 to the IRS and $196 to the state for not filing her
returns for tax year 2013. (GE 3.)
In response to a January 23, 2018, request from the DOD CAF, Applicant provided
on March 23, 2018, her IRS tax account transcripts for tax years 2013 through 2016. The
IRS account transcripts showed that she had paid the IRS $426 in April 2014 for tax year
2013 and $400 in April 2015 for tax year 2014, with no returns filed for those tax years.
She filed her Federal tax return for tax year 2015 on time and was entitled to a $170 refund
on adjusted gross income of $69,447. She submitted her Federal income tax return for tax
year 2016 within the extended deadline and was issued a Federal tax refund of $2,387 on
adjusted gross income of $36,372. As of May 23, 2018, state tax records showed that she
paid $196 in May 2016 for tax year 2013, and $200 on April 15, 2015, for tax year 2014.
Tax returns had not been received by the state for tax year 2013 or 2014. She filed her
state income tax returns on time for tax year 2015 and 2016. She paid $146 for tax year
2015 and was credited $1,216 for tax year 2016. (GE 2.)
Applicant filed her Federal income tax return for tax year 2014 on June 1, 2018,
using tax software. She was assessed penalties for late filing and late payment. She paid
almost $277 on August 21, 2018, in full resolution of her Federal tax delinquency for tax
year 2014. (AE E; Tr. 42-43, 52.) As of her hearing in September 2018, she had completed
her state income tax return for tax year 2014 using tax software, but she had not submitted
it. She expected a state tax refund of $500 for tax year 2014. (Tr. 52.)
Applicant had not filed her Federal or state income tax returns for tax year 2013 as
of her September 17, 2018 hearing. (Tr. 51-52.) It is too late to file online for tax year 2013
so she has to obtain the paper forms to file the returns. (Tr. 43, 54.) She believes that she
has a “mental block against [filing] taxes.” She consulted psychotherapists and behavioral
therapists “probably before 2014 and 2015” about her anxiety in that regard. (Tr. 46, 53-
54.) She also has “trouble with the paperwork and getting all the records together because
[she is] a little bit disorganized, especially with paperwork, and [she tends] to put things
off.”  (Tr.  47.)  She  finds  tax  preparation  confusing  but  has  not  sought  professional
assistance because gathering the paperwork is her responsibility, and she has difficulty
doing it. (Tr. 56-57.)
Applicant had not filed her Federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2017 as
of September 2018, but she had an extension to file to mid-October 2018. (Tr. 57.) When
asked  about  her  intention  regarding  filing  her  tax  returns  on  time  in  the  future,  she
responded:
Well, I can’t give you a big guarantee, but I will try because this is kind of a
big mess. And I’m not sure if I will be working next year on April 15th, but I’ll
have  plenty  of  time  to  get  the  paper—get  the  things  together, get  all  the
papers together. I’ve had some medical issues, so that’s kind of, you know, I
come home and I just go to bed. But, you know, I mean, basically it’s my
responsibility. It’s my—you know, I’m not saying that those things are the
reasons why I haven’t done it, but it is definitely my big—my big sore spot.
And it doesn’t really make sense, because I think that I would have had more
money in refunds if I had filed my taxes on time and, you know, found the
paperwork  to  do  the  insurance  correctly  and,  you  know,  the  medical
deductions and all that stuff. (Tr. 64-65.)
Applicant’s annual gross income is approximately $85,000. (Tr. 58.) She has an
investment portfolio with a value exceeding $500,000 as of late April 2018. (AE A.) She has
a mortgage on her home that she repays at $2,248 per month. As of early June 2018, the
principal balance of her mortgage loan was $203,565. She has more than $400,000 in
equity in her home. (AE B.)
A  military  officer  familiar  with  Applicant’s  work  performance  attested  that  her
attention to detail and commitment to her duties is invaluable. She has been an “overall
contributor” to the organization’s success. He has “utmost confidence” in her dedication
and  her  abilities  to  execute  her  duties,  and  he  considers  her  to  be  of  “great  moral
character.” In his opinion, Applicant has demonstrated that she is worthy of being trusted
with the security clearance needed to perform her work more effectively. (AE G.)
A  co-worker  described  Applicant  as  “efficient,  detail-oriented,  and  extremely
competent.”  Applicant  has  been  extremely  responsible  and  a  leader when it comes to
meeting  project  schedules  with  quality.  She  has  demonstrated  an  understanding  of
complex technical content and high interpersonal skills. This co-worker highly recommends
Applicant as a valuable asset. (AE F.)
