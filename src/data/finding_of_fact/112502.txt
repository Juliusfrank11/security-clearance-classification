In Applicant’s SOR responses, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, and 1.e
through  1.i.  (HE  6)  He  denied  the  other SOR  allegations  except  he  was  unsure  about
SOR  ¶  1.j.  (HE  6)  He  also  provided  extenuating  and  mitigating  information.  (HE  6)
Applicant’s SOR responses and attached documentation are admitted into evidence. (Tr.
16)

Financial Considerations
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that a federal tax lien was filed against Applicant in April 2016
for  $49,000.  SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  1.c,  and  1.d  allege  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal
income tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2017. Applicant used accountants to
help him file his income tax returns for at least the previous 10 years. (Tr. 35-36) Applicant
said the IRS initially audited tax years 2008, 2009, and 2010, and he was first notified that
additional taxes were due in 2013 or 2014. (Tr. 31)
On  November  8,  2012,  the  IRS  wrote  Applicant  and  explained  that  the  IRS
reclassified  Applicant and  some other workers from  “independent contractors”  or 1099
filers to “employees” who receive W-2s from their employer. (Tr. 31; AE C at 31) The IRS
denied  Schedule  C  expense  deductions;  however,  Applicant  was  credited  with  the
employer paying the employer’s share of Social Security taxes. (AE C at 31) For tax year
2009, Applicant owed an additional $17,000 and for tax year 2010, Applicant owed an
additional $6,000. The IRS advised Applicant that he could appeal the IRS examination.
(Tr. 31-32; AE C at 29) On October 16, 2013, the IRS wrote Applicant about his tax debt
for tax years 2009 and 2010 and indicated he owed a total of about $40,000 for those two
years. (GE 6) The IRS provided a detailed list of the charges and changes for those tax
years. (GE 6)
The IRS represented that Applicant owed the following federal income tax debts:

Applicant did not disclose any delinquent debts and that he failed to timely file or
fully  pay  his  federal  income  taxes  when  due  on  his  May  31,  2015  security  clearance
application  (SCA).  (GE  1)  In  Applicant’s  February  20,  2018  Office  of  Personnel
Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), he discussed the IRS tax lien, said
he disputed his tax debt, and claimed he timely filed all tax returns. (GE 2 at 7-8) In the
OPM PSI, Applicant said he had a plan to resolve his delinquent debts, and he intended
to execute that plan. (GE 2 at 10) He blamed his delinquent debts on his former spouse’s
gambling and excessive spending. (GE 2 at 10-11)
The  IRS  indicated  as  of  August  11,  2018,  Applicant’s  federal  income  tax  debt
totaled $85,000. (AE C at 5) The IRS summary included information about taxes, interest,
and penalties. (AE C at 5)  The IRS letter also notes that the IRS had not received a tax
return for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2017, and Applicant owed delinquent taxes and/or
interest and penalties for tax years 2009, 2010, 2014, 2015, and 2017. (AE C at 1, 5; GE
3 at 19, 21; GE 3 at 25) Applicant’s accountant also said he owed delinquent taxes for
tax year 2011 ($206). (AE C at 1, 5)
On  December  18,  2018,  the  U.S.  Attorney  filed  a  response  in  Applicant’s
bankruptcy indicating: (1) Applicant did not appeal the audits for tax years 2009 and 2010,
and the audit’s determination of his tax debt constitute his tax liability; and (2) Applicant
never filed a tax return for tax year 2014. (GE 6 at 65)
Applicant said he timely filed the tax returns, and he had copies of them. (Tr. 36-
37) I asked Applicant to provide copies of the tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and
2015. (Tr. 65) He said he was going to ask his accountant when she submitted those tax
returns. (Tr. 65) He sent a registered mail receipt showing something was submitted to
the IRS on April 15, 2015, and he said this was his 2014 federal income tax return. (Tr.
66, 73; AE A at 2) I have credited Applicant with timely filing his federal income tax return
for tax year 2014. He said he was unaware that the IRS had not received his tax returns
until 2018 when he received the IRS information at his bankruptcy. (Tr. 37) He said he
“reproduced” the tax returns and received the refunds. (Tr. 37)
Applicant’s May 22, 2018 IRS tax transcript for tax year 2016 indicates a $4,000
refund was transferred to address his debt for tax year 2009 on April 15, 2017. (GE 3 at
24)
On May 20, 2019, the IRS notified Applicant that he was credited with a $4,000
refund for tax year 2015, and this refund was applied to his tax debt for tax year 2009.
(AE C at 9) He was also credited with a $3,000 refund for tax year 2017, and this refund
was applied to his tax debt for tax year 2009. (AE C at 11)
Applicant  said  he  was  unwilling  to  settle  with  the  IRS  because  the  IRS  kept
changing the amounts owed. (Tr. 53, 60) He said the IRS did not act in good faith. (Tr.
54) He believed everyone who worked for his employer was targeted by the IRS. (Tr. 54-
55) Applicant believed he was making constructive progress resolving his federal income
tax debt because he recently asked the IRS for an advocate to be appointed. (Tr. 34) He
wanted the tax advocate to obtain a settlement amount from the IRS, and then negotiate
an offer in compromise and payment plan. (Tr. 60)
Applicant’s May 10, 2019 IRS tax transcript for tax year 2009 shows a zero balance
owed. (AE C at 17-22) On October 8, 2018, the IRS wrote off the balance due of $30,000.
(AE C at 22) It is unclear why the IRS applied the refunds of $4,000 and $3,000 for tax
years 2015 and 2017 to tax year 2009 because they were applied in 2019 after the IRS
wrote off the balance owed for 2009.
Applicant’s May 22, 2018 IRS tax transcript for tax year 2009 shows $30,000 owed.
(GE 3 at 5) The most recent payment that was not a refund from another tax year was
$150 paid on February 27, 2017. (GE 3 at 8)
On  June  25,  2019,  Applicant’s  accountant  wrote  that  Applicant  owed  an
unspecified  amount  to  the  IRS  for  tax  year  2009,  and  citing  a  May  19,  2019,  IRS  tax
transcript, the accountant said Applicant owed $24,000 to the IRS for tax year 2010. (Tr.
57; AE C at 1-2, 24-28) The most recent payment toward his tax debt for tax year 2010,
according to the May 19, 2019 IRS tax transcript, was $150 on February 10, 2014. (AE C
at 27; GE 3 at 11) The IRS added $11,000 to the debt for tax year 2010 on February 10,
2014 “by examination.” (AE C at 2, 27; GE 3 at 11) The accountant was unsure about the
basis of examination’s result. (AE C at 2) Applicant’s accountant believes the tax debt for
tax year 2010 is unsettled and might be substantially less. (Tr. 58; AE C at 2)
Applicant believed the IRS miscalculated his taxes, and he was actually taxed as
both an employee and an independent contractor. (Tr. 32) Applicant believed the lien was
filed against his residence; he was able to refinance his mortgage; and he believed the
lien was lifted. (Tr. 33) Applicant said that his accountant determined he might be due a
refund. (Tr. 32)
On  September  30,  2019,  Applicant  sent  an  email  and  provided  an  Installment
Agreement Request, IRS Form 9465 indicating he offered to settle a $48,000 IRS debt
by making $884 monthly payments for 72 months. (AE G; AE I) Applicant’s signature is
dated September 27, 2019. (AE I) Payments under the installment agreement  start on
November 25, 2019. (AE I)
Applicant continues to contest the amount of the tax debt, and his accountant plans
to meet with a taxpayer advocate. (AE I; AE J) Applicant’s accountant promised to work
with the taxpayer advocate to resolve Applicant’s tax issues. (AE J)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  Applicant  filed  for  bankruptcy  under  Chapter  13  of  the
Bankruptcy Code in August 2018, and it was dismissed on April 25, 2019. Applicant said
the IRS was not cooperating with him, and he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection.
(Tr. 38) His attorney advised him that the bankruptcy was a good idea, and he went along
with  this  advice.  (Tr.  60)  The  bankruptcy  required  monthly  payments  that  Applicant
believed he could not afford; the IRS “changed the deal”; and he elected not to continue
the bankruptcy. (Tr. 39-41) He received a $19,000 refund from the bankruptcy court. (Tr.
51) He said he was retaining the $19,000 for the present. (Tr. 51) He has about $35,000
in his 401(k) account, and he is holding those funds in reserve too. (Tr. 51-53)
SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g allege that two charged-off debts were owed to the same bank
for $9,286  and  $10,590.  Applicant  said  his former spouse  handled  the family  finances
during their marriage, and she mismanaged these two credit cards. (Tr. 41-43) Applicant
assumed responsibility for the debts in his divorce, and the creditor charged off the debts.
(Tr. 42) He accepted responsibility for the debts, and he said it was very difficult to settle
them. (Tr. 42) In a letter dated August 2, 2019, the creditor for the $9,286 debt agreed to
settle the debt for $5,575 with the first installment payment of $3,645 due by August 1,
2019. (AE E) It is unclear why the letter is dated after the first payment is due. (AE E) He
did not present any evidence of payments actually made to address these two delinquent
bank debts.
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges Appellant’s has a $208,760 mortgage debt that is $15,601 past
due.  Applicant  said  the  account  became  past  due  during  the  Chapter  13  mortgage
process. (Tr. 43) On July 12, 2019, Applicant accepted a new payment arrangement with
the mortgage lender, and on July 18, 2019, the mortgage lender signed the agreement.
(Tr. 44; AE B; AE F) At the time of his hearing, he expected to make his first mortgage
payment  under  the  new  agreement  on  August  1,  2019;  however,  according  to  his
mortgage agreement, his first payment is due on September 1, 2019. (Tr. 45; AE F)
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges Appellant has a $2,103 credit-card debt that is $258 past due.
Applicant said he erroneously indicated in response to a DOHA interrogatory that he was
responsible for the debt. (Tr. 46) He subsequently determined that he was an authorized
user on this credit-card account, and he was not responsible for this debt. (Tr. 45-47)
SOR  ¶  1.j  alleges  Appellant  has  a  $1,061  bank  debt  that  is  $293  past  due.
Applicant was responsible for this debt in the divorce decree. (Tr. 47) Applicant said he
was  unaware  of  this  account,  and  it  did  not  appear  in  his  credit  report.  (Tr.  47)  He
accepted responsibility for this debt in his SOR response.
Applicant said he did not have any formal financial counseling; however, he did
receive advice and counsel from his accountant. (Tr. 55) His Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing
indicates he had credit counseling within 180 days of filing his Chapter 13 bankruptcy in
August 2018. (GE 6 at 5 of 54) He uses a monthly budget, and he sets aside about half
of his income for debt resolution. (Tr. 55-56)
Character Evidence
A GG-13 has known Applicant for more than 20 years and worked with Applicant
for  nine  years.  (AE  A  at  5)  He  described  Applicant  as  loyal  and  trustworthy,  and  he
recommended approval of Applicant’s security clearance. (AE A at 5)
