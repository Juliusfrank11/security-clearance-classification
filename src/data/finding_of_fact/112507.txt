Applicant is a 49-year-old chief executive officer (CEO) and owner of a company
doing  business  as  a  subcontractor  for  a  defense  contractor.  He  is  a  high  school
graduate. He is divorced with one child.1
Applicant  was  president  and  owner  of  a  company  from  1996  to  2007;  he  was
CEO and owner of another company from 2007 to 2015; and he has been the CEO of
his current company since 2015.2
Applicant  developed  financial  problems,  which  he  attributed  to  loss  of  business
after  the  attacks  on  9/11,  the  financial  crisis  and  recession  in  the  later  2000s  that
affected his business, and his 2010 divorce. He did not pay his federal and state income
taxes and other debts.3
Applicant  owes  the  IRS  for  tax  years  2002,  2003,  2004,  2008,  and  2010.  The
taxes owed for 2002 through 2004 are civil penalties from when Applicant failed to pay
the  taxes  that  were  withheld  from  his  employees’  paychecks.  He  stated  that  he  could
not keep his employees  working and also pay the taxes, so he decided not to pay the
taxes.4
Applicant’s  adjusted  gross  income  for  2010  was  $171,420;  his  tax  liability  was
$34,986;  and  his  only  payment  was  $4,987,  which  was  paid  on  April  15,  2011.  As  of
September  2016,  with  penalties  and  interest,  he  owed  the  IRS  $56,536  for  2010.  It  is
unclear how much he owes the IRS in total, but Applicant estimated his federal tax debt
at  $400,000.  In  May  2015,  the  IRS  temporarily  closed  the  collection  case,  having
determined  that  Applicant  did  not  have  the  ability  to  pay  the  amount  owed.  The  IRS
informed him that he still owed the money, and penalties and interest would continue to
accrue.  In  August  2018,  the  IRS  determined  that  the  account  was  again  considered
collectible.5
In April 2017, the IRS transferred $2,272 from what would have been a refund for
tax year 2016 to Applicant’s civil penalty for 2002. Applicant owed the IRS for tax year
2017, but he made three payments totaling $6,954 between August 2018 and October
4,  2018,  to  pay  all  the  taxes  owed  for  that  year.  Applicant  is  working  on  an  offer  in

compromise with the IRS. As of the close of the record on June 4, 2019, there was no
agreement in place.6
Applicant and  his  state  entered  a  payment agreement  in August 2018,  in  which
Applicant agreed to pay $851 per month for 60 months for the balance due of $44,533.
He  established  that  he  made  payments  and  reduced  the  balance  to  $39,726  as  of
February 2019.7
In  addition  to  the  unpaid  federal  and  state  taxes,  The  SOR  alleges  three
delinquent  debts  totaling  $18,576  and  an  unpaid  $10,709  judgment.  Applicant
established that he paid the $5,718 (SOR ¶ 1.d) and $5,682 (SOR ¶ 1.e) debts in April
and May 2018. The creditor for the $7,176 debt (SOR ¶ 1.c) issued an IRS form 1099-C
(Cancellation  of  Debt)  in  2015,  forgiving  the  debt.  Applicant  settled  the  judgment  in
October  2018  for  $10,709  (SOR  ¶  1.f),  payable  in  ten  monthly  payments  of  $1,079.
Applicant established that he made payments pursuant to the agreement.8
Applicant  called  a  neighbor  as  a  witness  who  testified  that  he  is  honest  and
diligent. Applicant stated that he deeply cares about his service to this country, and that
he hopes he can continue to serve it. He asserted that regardless of the decision in this
case,  he  “will,  of  course,  take  care  of  [his]  financial  obligations  as  [he  has]  always
done.”9
