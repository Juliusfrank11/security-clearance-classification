In Applicant’s SOR responses, he admitted all of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) He
also provided extenuating and mitigating information. (HE 3) His admissions are accepted
as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 38-year-old information assurance security officer or a cybersecurity
analyst for a defense contractor. (Tr. 5-6) In 2000, he graduated from high school, and he
attended  college  for  one  year.  (Tr.  5)  He  has  no  military  service.  (Tr.  6)  He  has  never
married, and he has two children ages five and nine. (Tr. 21-22) His only unemployment
in the last five years was for five or six months in 2018 to 2019. (Tr. 7)
Financial Considerations
SOR ¶ 1.a alleged Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for
tax years 2012 through 2016. Applicant admitted he failed to timely file his federal income
tax returns. He explained why he did not timely file his tax returns as follows:
I claimed kids that I thought were mine at the time, unfortunately. And that
came back as a very  big hit on my taxes in me owing. And in my mind I
stated that, you know what? The Government can keep all taxes that I have.
I don’t require that money back. But coming into, you know, working with
the Government in my job field, especially with this -- this -- with getting my
clearance to continue my job I see the importance of filing regardless if I
don't mind if the Government keeps my money or not.
(Tr.  20-21)  In  his  SOR  response,  he  said  he  “assum[ed]  that  the  Federal  government
would be satisfied with the tax withholdings being deducted from [his] pay without taking
action to file a return” and in response to the security-clearance process he has taken
action to file all required returns.
The  IRS  represented  in  May  9,  2018  tax  transcripts  that  Applicant  filed  federal
income tax returns and owed the following federal income tax debts as follows:

In the column above, the IRS claimed amount is the first amount, and the amount
determined  by  Applicant’s  subsequent  tax  filing  is  in  parenthesis.  Applicant  owed  the
following amounts when he filed his state tax returns: 2012 return undated (refund: $300);
2013  return  dated  October  2019  (amount  owed:  $100);  2014  return  undated  (amount
owed:  $200);  2015  return  dated  October  2019  (amount  owed:  $100);  and  2016  return
dated April 2017 (refund: $1,000). (AE E; AE F) Applicant explained that somehow the
state tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2015 were not recorded when sent, and they had
to be refiled in October 2019. (AE H, email) Applicant is credited with intending to file his
state  tax  returns  the  same  month  in  2018  as  he  filed  his  federal  income  tax  returns.
Information from federal income tax returns is easily transferred to state tax returns, and
Applicant did not have any reason not to file his state tax returns when he filed his federal
income tax returns. However, he was negligent in that he should have retained a copy of
his state tax returns when he filed them; he should have been able to show that he paid
the commercial tax preparer who prepared his federal income tax return to generate both
a federal and state tax return; and he should have noticed when his payments to the state
for tax years 2013 and 2015 were not cashed or deducted from his accounts.
On April 2, 2018, a state tax lien for $2,000 was vacated and withdrawn. (Tr. 31-
33; AE C) On February 6, 2018, Applicant established a nine-month payment plan with
the state tax authority wherein he agreed to pay $46 a month. (Tr. 31) He said he timely
made all of his payments, and his state tax debt is resolved. (Tr. 31, 34) After he filed his
state tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2015 in October 2019, he owed additional taxes.
(AE H) Starting November 15, 2019, Applicant has a payment agreement with the state
tax authority to pay $65 monthly for three months. (AE H)  He timely filed his 2017 and
2018 federal and state tax returns. (Tr. 28-29; AE A; AE B; AE G) He owes a small state
tax debt which is less than $40 for tax year 2018. (Tr. 35)
In May 2018, Applicant agreed to begin making monthly payments to the IRS of
$25 for the first year and $80 for the second year to address his federal income tax debt
for tax years 2012, 2015, and 2016. (Tr. 35-36; GE 2) The IRS letter is inconsistent with
the  tax  information  presented  in  the  above  table.  He  made  the  following  monthly
payments to the IRS from March 2018 to September 2019: March 2018 ($31); June 2018
through  May  2019  ($50);  and  June  2019  through  September  2019  ($85).  (AE  E)  His
payments were made to address tax debts from tax years 2012, 2017, and 2018. (AE E)
It is unclear why Applicant’s federal income tax return for tax year 2012 shows a refund
of $400; however, the IRS applied the most recent 15 payments up to September 2019
to address his federal income tax debt for tax year 2012. (AE E) Applicant did not provide
an explanation for this inconsistency.
In sum, Applicant failed to timely file his state and federal income tax returns for
tax years 2011 (filed March 2018), 2013 (filed May 2018), and 2015 (filed March 2018).
His 2011, 2013, and 2015 tax returns were filed after he completed his March 18, 2016
SCA,  and  after  his  June  21,  2017  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  personal
subject interview (PSI), but before the SOR was issued on June 13, 2018. The magnitude
of his current federal income tax debt is unclear. His state and federal income tax debts
are in the process of being resolved through payment plans.
Personal Conduct
Two questions in Section 26 of Applicant’s March 18, 2016 SCA asked about filing
and paying federal or state income taxes when required during the previous seven years.
In response to one question, Applicant disclosed that he failed to file or pay his 2011 state
taxes. (GE 1) He said in the comments section that he was audited and his deduction or
exemption for two dependents was denied, and he owed about $1,000 to the state.  Id.
He said he had an established payment arrangement to pay $50 monthly to the state. Id.
The second question asked whether he had any other instances when he failed to file or
pay  federal  or  state  income  taxes  in  the  previous  seven  years  as  required,  and  he
answered, “no.” Id.
During Applicant’s June 21, 2017 OPM PSI, he disclosed that he had not filed or
paid his state and federal income tax returns for tax year 2015. (AE D at 11) He said he
did not want to deal with taxes anymore and was fearful because of the audit of his 2011
taxes. Id. He said he did not list the failure to file a tax return for tax year 2015 on his SCA
because he overlooked the question. Id. The OPM PSI does not include anything about
his not timely filing his income tax returns for tax years 2011 and 2013. (AE D) Applicant
clarified that he believed the tax audit related to taxes prior to 2010 and not tax year 2011
as indicated in his March 18, 2016 SCA. (Tr. 45)
At his hearing, Applicant said he did not disclose his failure to timely file his federal
income tax returns as follows:
To be honest why I was very bad with this stuff with taxes and stuff like that,
I  answered  to  the  best  of  my  ability  at  that  time.  Until  and  when  it  was
brought to my attention that it wasn’t, I called IRS, called State as well to
make sure that, you know, I’d get all this stuff straightened away.
(Tr. 37)
