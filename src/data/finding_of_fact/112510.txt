Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  16  delinquent  accounts
totaling $64,265. Applicant denies SOR ¶ 1.a, a $12,765 debt for a car loan, and SOR ¶
1.p,  a  $1,136  credit-card  account.  He  admits  the  remaining  14  debts,  all  of  which  are
delinquent  student  loans  totaling  $50,364.  The  delinquent  debts  are  reflected  in
Applicant’s  credit  bureau  reports  (CBR)  from  May  2018  and  December  2017,  and
discussed on his e-QIP and during his personal subject interview (PSI). (GX 6; GX 5; GX
3; GX 4.) Applicant’s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  33-year-old  service  desk  administrator  currently  working  for  a
defense  contractor  since  September  2017.  He  served  honorably  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force
from  June 2006  until March  2012,  and  was  granted  a  security  clearance  in  November
2006.  He received his associate’s degree in 2013 and his bachelor’s degree in 2015. He
and his wife married in 2009. (GX 2.)
Applicant denies that he owes the $12,765 debt for a car loan alleged in SOR ¶
1.a. According to Applicant, during the process of purchasing a new car from a dealership,
the dealership paid off the loan on the car that Applicant was trading in, but then would
not  accept  the  actual  trade  in.  Applicant  went  to  a  second  dealership,  where  he  was
informed  that  the  original  dealership  had  paid  off  the  trade-in  car.  When  the  original
dealership discovered that it had paid for a trade-in that it did not receive, it changed its
records to reflect that Applicant was liable for the amount the original dealership paid for
the trade in. (GX 3; GX 2.) With his Answer, Applicant provided a letter from the lender
from November 2014 that stated the loan for the trade in had been paid in full. Applicant
further stated that he discussed the loan with another dealership and was told that he was
not  responsible  for  the  debt.  However,  Applicant’s  CBRs  show  that  the  account  was
charged off by the original dealership in April 2015. Applicant’s May 2018 CBR also shows
that he disputed the debt after it was charged off. Applicant did not provide any information
about what actually happened to the trade-in car. This debt remains unresolved.
Applicant provided a letter from March 2018 from the creditor of the $1,136 credit-
card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.p, which stated that the account was paid. This debt has
been resolved.
Applicant admitted each of the 14 delinquent student loan accounts. He attributes
his inability to pay his student loans to underemployment. Applicant asserted that he was
trying to consolidate his student loans and that he was seeking better paying employment
1  The  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA)  transmittal  letter  is  dated  June  1,  2018,  and
Applicant’s receipt is dated June 14, 2018. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30
days after receiving it to submit information.  The DOHA transmittal letter and receipt are appended to the
record as Administrative Exhibit 1.
in order to resolve these debts. (GX 3.) However, there is no record evidence of resolution
of these debts.
Applicant  was  unemployed  for  five  months  after  leaving  the  military  in  2012.
However, he has been consistently employed since August 2012.
