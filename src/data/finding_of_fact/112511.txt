Financial Considerations
The  SOR  alleges  in  ¶  2.a  that  Applicant  had  a  gambling  addiction  beginning  in
about  2012.  The  SOR  alleges  in  ¶¶  2.b  through  2.g  that  Applicant  borrowed  funds  in
various  amounts  from  friends  under  false  pretenses  to  support  his  gambling  habit,  and

friends who live in the United States as listed in SOR ¶¶ 2.b to 2.g to use for gambling.

contact  information for  the  creditors  in  SOR  ¶¶ 2.e and 2.g.  (SOR  response) He  either

(Tr. 68)
SOR  ¶  2.h  alleges  in  about  2014  to  2015,  Applicant  initiated  electronic  fund
transfers to a credit card, even though he knew he did not have the funds to cover the
transfers in his account. He then used his credit card for cash advances to enable him to
gamble. (Tr. 69-71; SOR response)
SOR  ¶¶  2.i,  2.j,  and  2.k  allege  three  delinquent  debts  as  follows:  a  charged-off

and a debt placed for collection for $617 (2.k).
For  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  2.i,  he  borrowed  $12,500  and  used  the  funds  to  gamble.
(Tr. 69-72) In 2016, he made three payments totaling about $750. He wanted to offer to

with the creditor, and he stopped making payments. (Tr. 70, 77-78)

the  creditor  wanted  $2,500.  (Tr.  79)  He  is  willing  to  settle  the  debt;  however,  he  was
unable to arrange a settlement that was fair. (Tr. 79-80)

gambled about six times. (Tr. 73) Since 2016, he has lost more than $10,000 gambling.
(Tr.  74)  He  said  he  is  trying  to  control  his  gambling.  (Tr.  74)  He  has  reduced  his
gambling from two or three times a week to about once a month or less. (Tr. 75, 83) He
continues to have  brief  urges  to  gamble;  however,  he  is able  to  resist  these  urges  and
not gamble. (Tr. 75) He has watched some documentaries and Internet presentations on
gambling  addiction;  however,  he  has  never  received  gambling-addiction  counseling  or
therapy. (Tr. 83)
Applicant  has  little  savings  and  lives  month-to-month  on  his  salary.  (Tr.  82)  In
2015, he received a federal income tax refund, and he used half for gambling and sent

and letters of support for his service as a linguist in Afghanistan and the United States.
(AE A) Letters and certificates lauded his outstanding performance of duty and support
of  U.S.  Forces

Afghanistan in 2005. (AE A at 16)

Afghanistan
Afghanistan  is  a  country  in  Southwestern  Asia  that  is  approximately  the  size  of
Texas  (249,935  square  miles).  Pakistan  borders  it  on  the  east  and  the  south.  Iran
borders it on the west and Russia to the north. It is a rugged and mountainous country
which  has  been fought  over  by  powerful  nations for  centuries.  In  2009,  the  population
was  about  28  million  people  with  about  3  million  Afghans  living  outside  Afghanistan,
mainly in Pakistan and Iran, although over 5 million have returned since the removal of
the Taliban regime.
Afghanistan  is  presently  an  Islamic  Republic  with  a  democratically-elected
president. Afghanistan has had a turbulent political history, including an invasion by the
Soviet  Union  in  1979.  After  an  accord  was  reached  in  1989,  and  the  Soviet  Union
withdrew  from  Afghanistan,  fighting  continued  among  the  various  ethnic,  clan,  and
religious militias. By the end of 1998, the Taliban rose to power and controlled 90% of
the country, imposing aggressive and repressive policies.
In October 2001, U.S. forces and coalition partners led military operations in the
country,  forcing  the  Taliban  out  of  power  by  November  2001.  The  coalition  sought  to
oust  al-Qaeda,  Osama  bin  Laden,  and  other  terrorists  seeking  to  attack  the  United
States  from  Afghanistan. The  new  democratic  government  took  power  in  2004  after  a
popular election.
A  U.S.  State  Department  Travel  Advisory  remains  in  effect  for  Afghanistan  at
Travel  Advisory  Level  4-Do  not  travel.  The  State  Department  warns  U.S.  citizens
against  travel  to  Afghanistan  because  of  continued  instability  and  threats  by  terrorist
organizations  against  U.S.  citizens.  Travel  to  all  areas  of  Afghanistan  remains  unsafe
due  to  the  ongoing  risk  of  kidnapping,  hostage-taking,  suicide  bombings,  military
combat  operations,  landmines,  terrorist  and  insurgent  attacks,  banditry,  armed  rivalry
between  political  and  tribal  groups,  militant  attacks,  direct  and  indirect  fire,  and
insurgent attacks, including attacks using vehicle-borne or other IEDs. Attacks may also
target  official  Afghan  and  U.S.  governmental  convoys  and  compounds,  foreign
embassies, military installations, and other public areas.
No  province  in  Afghanistan  is  immune  from  violence,  and  the  potential  exists
throughout the country for hostile acts, either targeted or random, against United States
and  other  foreign  nationals  at  any  time.  Extremists  associated  with  various  terrorist
networks  and  members  of  other  armed  opposition  groups  are  active  throughout  the
country and remain violently opposed to the Afghan government and Coalition Forces.
These  terrorist  groups  have  attacked  Afghan,  Coalition  Forces,  and  U.S.  targets  with
little regard for or the express intent to cause civilian casualties.
According to the June 2017 U.S. Department of Defense report on Afghanistan,
Afghanistan  faces  a  continuing  threat  from  insurgent  and  terrorist  networks  present  or
operating  in  the  Afghanistan-Pakistan  region.  Department  Counsel’s  administrative
notice lists recent terrorist attacks in Afghanistan resulting in the deaths of hundreds of
civilians and military personnel in 2017 and 2018. Although al-Qaeda’s core leadership
in  the  Afghanistan-Pakistan  border  region  has  been  degraded,  elements  continue  to
seek safe haven on both sides of the border to regenerate and conduct attack planning.
The United States’ extraordinary commitment to Afghanistan is balanced against
the inherent dangers of the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan to its citizens and residents
and Afghan government problems developing and complying with the rule of law. A top
national  security  goal  of  the  United  States  is  to  establish  relationships,  cooperation,
training,  and  support  of  the  Afghanistan  Government  and  military  in  the  ongoing  war
against terrorism.
