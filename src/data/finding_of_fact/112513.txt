After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant’s response to the SOR as
Item 1, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 58 years old and has worked for a defense contractor since July 2012.
He has not held a DoD security clearance. In June 1981, he married his wife. They have a
35-year-old daughter and a 33-year-old son. (Item 2) From May 2009 until November 2017,
he was a pastor. He had previously served as a pastor from June 2001 through October
2008. Between October 2008 and May 2009, he was the Director of Operations for an
association of churches.
On Applicant’s Electronic Questionnaires for Investigation Processing (e-QIP), he
indicated  he  lived  in  Canada  from  August  2012  through  November  2017.  (Item  2)  He
estimated his financial problems at $125,000 and listed the reason was because his wife
was prohibited from working while they lived in Canada. (Item 2) When interviewed by an
authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in January 2018, he
indicated his wife was now working for a doctor as a medical secretary. (Item 3) On his e-
QIP, he indicated the “Debts were forgiven.” He did not further explain this statement or
provide documentation supporting this assertion.
Applicant’s December 2017 credit report lists the debts in SOR 1.a ($50,658), SOR
1.b ($20,627), SOR 1.c ($15,534), and SOR 1.f ($276) as being in collection. (Item 4) The
report also lists the debts in SOR 1.d ($13,451) and SOR 1.e ($4,712) as being charged off
by the creditor. Applicant’s June 2018 credit report lists the debts in SOR 1.b ($20,627),
SOR 1.c ($15,534), and in SOR 1.d ($13,451) as being charged off by the creditor. (Item 5)
Applicant  indicated  in  his  January  2018  interview,  his  financial  delinquencies
resulted from his diagnosis and treatment for cancer twice. (Item 3) He did not list this as a
reason for his financial problems when he completed his e-QIP. He asserted, even though
he had health insurance, all of his treatment was not covered by his insurance. His income
as a pastor was insufficient to pay his medical bills. Additionally, his wife was not allowed to
work while in Canada.
Applicant indicated the credit card accounts listed in SOR 1.b, SOR 1.d, SOR 1.e,
and SOR 1.f were used to pay medical bills. There is no indication in the record as to when
he was diagnosed or treated for cancer or the cost of treatment. The delinquent obligation
listed in SOR 1.a ($50,658) was a student loan he took out for his son’s education. The
delinquent obligation listed in SOR 1.c ($15,534) was a department store account he used
to buy appliances and clothing. As of the date of his personal statement, January 2018, he
had not received financial counseling. During the interview, he did not indicate an intent to
pay any of the delinquent obligations.
