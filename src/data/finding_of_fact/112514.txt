In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  with  comments  all  of  the  factual
allegations pertaining to criminal conduct in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.i.), but he
failed to admit or deny the cross-allegations pertaining to personal conduct (SOR ¶ 2.a),
so  a  denial  was  registered  for  him.  Applicant’s  admissions  and  comments  are
incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the
evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due  consideration  of  same,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a condenser maintenance worker with his current employer since July 2017. A 2001
high school graduate, Applicant earned college and vocational credits but no degree. He
enlisted in the U.S. Navy in September 2001, and served on active duty until September
2009,  when  he  was  honorably  discharged.  He  remained  in  the  active  reserve,  with
deployments to Guam and Afghanistan, and he re-enlisted on active duty in November
2014. Applicant was discharged in April 2016, and  he was issued a general discharge
under honorable conditions. He was granted a secret clearance in 2004. Applicant has
never married. He has no children.
Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct
In part, because of Applicant’s consumption of alcohol, he has a lengthy history of
disregarding laws, rules, and regulations. The SOR alleged nine incidents of criminality
and  personal  conduct  by  Applicant  commencing  in  2003,  and  continuing  until  at  least
2017.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a.): In March 2003, when he was a 19-year-old seaman (E-3), Applicant
received non-judicial punishment for violation of Article 91  (Disrespect toward Superior
Petty Officer), Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). He was restricted to the vessel
for five days. Applicant denied, and there is no independent evidence to the contrary, that
he  was  reduced  in  rank  as  alleged  in  the  SOR,  although  Applicant  caused  some
controversy  initially  by  saying  the  allegation  was  accurate.  He  described  the  episode
leading  up  to  his  discipline,  as  follows:  He  was  sitting  with  his  roommate  during  lunch
when he got up to obtain some additional beverage, but when he returned, someone was
sitting in his place, although Applicant’s full tray of food was still unmoved. He asked the
individual to move so he could finish his meal and was told to wait because the individual
was  talking  to  someone.  Applicant  placed  his  hands  under  the  individual’s  armpits  to
assist him out of the seat. Applicant was not aware of the individual’s rank at the time.
With added maturity, Applicant realized that he could have handled the situation better by
simply moving his seat to finish his lunch.1
(SOR  ¶  1.b.):  In  September  2007,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with
Driving  While  Intoxicated  (DWI)  –  1st  offense,  a  misdemeanor.  Although  the  Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Identification Record reported that he was convicted of the
charge on November 7, 2007, and sentenced to 12 months and 5 days, with 12 months
suspended, along with unsupervised probation, Applicant stated, and the SOR alleged,
that he was sentenced to 10 days in jail.2 The trial court apparently also mandated that
Applicant  install  an  ignition  interlock  or  car  breathalyzer,3  suspended  his  operator’s
license  for  one  year,  and  ordered  him  to  attend  an  Alcohol  Safety  Action  Program
(ASAP).4  Applicant  described  the  events  leading  up  to  his  arrest:  He  had  attended  a
friend’s promotion party-cookout, consumed three of four mixed vodka drinks, and then
went  to  another  event  that  was  motorcycle-related.  That  event  became  somewhat
raucous,  and  when  the  police  arrived,  everyone  departed.  Applicant  was  stopped  one
block from the party and administered a sobriety test, which he failed.5
(SOR  ¶¶  1.c.,  1.d.,  and  1.e.):  As  noted  above,  because  of  the  court  sentence
associated with Applicant’s September 2007 DWI, he was required to attend ASAP. He
repeatedly failed to do so, claiming that he did not have sufficient funds available because
of  the  costs  associated  with  the  ignition  interlock,  attorney  and  court  fees,  and  his
increased insurance costs.6 In March 2008, he was required to show cause on a charge
of ASAP Non-Comply. On April 24, 2008, he entered a plea of guilty and was ordered to
pay court costs of $76. He paid his court costs in March 2009.7 In September 2008, he

the SOR, dated July 9, 2018), at 1.

3 Such a device prevents drunk drivers from driving their vehicle. It is connected to the vehicle, and
it has a preset level for blood alcohol concentration (BAC) determined by  the state. If a would-be driver
blows into the device when he or she is over the set BAC limit, the vehicle will not start.

was again required to show cause on a charge of ASAP Non-Comply. On May 7, 2009,
he entered a plea of not guilty, but was found guilty, and he was ordered to pay court
costs  of $76.  He paid his court costs  in  December  2009.8  In  May  2010,  he  was  again
required to show cause on a charge of ASAP Non-Comply. On June 24, 2010, he entered
a plea of not guilty, but was found guilty. The case was immediately appealed,9 because
Applicant claimed that he had actually fulfilled his ASAP obligation.10
(SOR ¶ 1.f.): In October 2015, Applicant was charged with DWI – 2nd offense, a
misdemeanor. On January 4, 2016, he was found guilty and sentenced to 60 days (50
days  suspended),  fined  $500,  ordered  to  pay  $296  in  court  costs,  and  his  operator’s
license was restricted for three years, commencing on January 4, 2016. He paid his fine
and court costs on April 7, 2016.11 Applicant described the events leading up to his arrest:
A girlfriend was being transferred so a group of friends decided to take her out. One of
the friends – a designated sober driver – got angry towards the end of the evening and
as she was departing in another vehicle, she threw Applicant’s keys out the window to
him, leaving him without a designated driver. Although Applicant denied being intoxicated,
he  drove  the  vehicle  away,  and  was  stopped.  He  acknowledged  that  he  made  an
irresponsible decision.12
(SOR ¶ 1.g.): In March 2016, Applicant was charged with  Contempt of Court, a
misdemeanor.13  Applicant’s  descriptions  associated  with  this  incident  are  somewhat
inconsistent. He initially claimed it was about a missed court date, but later claimed that
the  charge  was  associated  with  his  failure  to  enroll  in  ASAP  by  a  certain  date.  He
displayed proof that he was enrolled in a class that was scheduled to commence in April
2016. The charge was eventually dismissed on July 25, 2016.14
(SOR  ¶  1.h.):  In  March  2016,  Applicant  received  non-judicial  punishment  for
violation of Article 92 (Failure to Obey a Lawful Order), UCMJ. The charge was related to
his October 2015 DWI. He was restricted to the vessel for 45 days and reduced from E-6
to  E-5.  Applicant  was  also  notified  that  he  was  to  be  administratively  processed  for
discharge.15

(SOR  ¶  1.i.):  In  February  2017,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Operating
Suspended/Revoked,  a  misdemeanor,  essentially  driving  after  a  forfeiture  of  an
operator’s license. On March 17, 2017, he was convicted as charged and sentenced to
30 days (suspended), 3 additional months of suspension, fined $250, and ordered to pay
$91 in court costs. He paid his fine and court costs on June 7, 2017.16 Applicant described
the events leading up to his arrest: Because he could no longer afford to reside in his
home,  and  he  was  unable  to  find  someone  to  assist  him  in  moving  his  belongings  to
storage, he moved them himself on two trips. On the third trip, he was stopped by the
same  officer  who  had  stopped  him  in  October  2015.  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he
made a foolish decision.17
Applicant contended that he completed a four-week ASAP in May 2016, and that
as  of  October  2017,  he  was  still  participating  in  another  18-week  class  that  was
temporarily interrupted by a job-related trip to sea. He failed to submit any documents to
support his contentions related to his attendance or completion of the ASAP programs.
He denied ever being diagnosed for any alcohol-related condition. He also finally realized
that  drinking  and  driving  resulted  in  his  having  to  pay  expensive  fines,  and  that  is
something  he  no  longer  wishes  to  do.  Although  he  used  to  drink  three  to  four  mixed
vodkas  during  the  weekends,  he  now  claims  that,  as  of  September  2017,  he  stopped
consuming alcohol.18
