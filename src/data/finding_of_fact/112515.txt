In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f,
1.h-1.l,  1.n,  2.a,  and  2.b.3  She  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.g  and  1.m.  Her
admissions  in  her  answer  and  at  the  hearing  are  incorporated  in  my  findings  of  fact.  I
granted  Department  Counsel’s  motion  to  withdraw  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.i  as  a
duplicate of SOR ¶ 1.b. (Tr. 17.)
Applicant  is  a  57-year-old  information  technology  (IT)  technician  employed  by
federal  contractors  since  April  2011,  with  a  period  of  unemployment  and  intermittent
employment  from  November  2015  to  March  2016.  She  has  held  a  security  clearance
since March 2012.
Applicant  married  in  April  1990  and  separated  in  April  1998.  Her  spouse  is
incarcerated. She has three children, ages 35, 28, and 26. She is a high-school graduate
and is attending a community college, working toward a professional certification. (Tr. 34-
35.)
Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army from November 1980 to March
1997 and was honorably discharged based on family hardship. She worked in the private
sector from May 1997 to July 2010 and was unemployed from July 2010 until she began
working for a federal contractor in April 2011.
Applicant testified that she left her job in November 2015 and moved to another
state to get away from a difficult customer of her employer. She testified that everyone in
her family was debt-free, she was intrigued by another city, and she wanted to get away
and be alone for a while. (Tr. 39.). She supported herself with income from intermittent
employment,  a  substantial  inheritance,  and  her  military  disability  pay.  (Tr.  41.)  She

2  Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  her  SCA  (GX  1)  unless  otherwise  indicated  by  a
parenthetical citation to the record.
3  Applicant  admitted  that  she  incorrectly  answered  “No”  to  two  financial  questions  in  her  SCA,  but  she
denied that she was aware of the judgment alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e and the delinquent debts alleged in SOR
¶¶ 1.a-1.d and 1.f-1.k. I have treated her responses to SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b as denials.
returned to her current state of domicile and began working for her current employer in
August 2017. (Tr. 36.).
The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file her federal and state tax returns,
that she owes federal and state taxes totaling about $7,000, and that she has 11 other
delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $19,720.  Her  delinquent  debts  are  reflected  in  credit
reports  from  September  2016  (GX  2)  and  February  2018  (GX  3).  The  evidence
concerning the allegations in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.g, and 1.k: medical bills placed for collection of $2,495;
$202; $10; $268; and $28. Applicant testified that she disputed these bills because she
was hospitalized for only two hours and she had medical insurance. She testified that she
contacted the medical provider and disputed the bills by telephone, but she did not reduce
her dispute to writing. (Tr. 44-45.)
SOR ¶ 1.c: cable-service bill placed for collection of $71. Applicant has taken
no action to resolve this debt. (Tr. 46-47.)
SOR ¶ 1.d: collection account for $10. Applicant has taken no action to resolve
this debt. (Tr. 47.)
SOR  ¶  1.e:  judgment  for  medical  debt  filed  in  2015  for  $289.  Applicant  was
unaware that this judgment was entered, because she was living in another state when it
was filed. She paid it in full in November 2015. (AX A.)
SOR  ¶  1.f:  debt  for  time-share  property  charged  off  for  $15,811.  Applicant
testified  that  she  contacted  the  property  manager  and  indicated  that  she  wanted  to
dispose of this property, but she has taken no further action to sell it or resolve the debt.
(Tr. 48-49.)
SOR  ¶¶  1.h  and  1.j:  utility  bill  placed  for  collection  of  $204  and  cable  bill
placed for collection of $140. Applicant testified that she incurred these bills while living
in another state. She has not contacted the creditors or made any effort to resolve these
debts. (Tr. 45-46.)
SOR ¶ 1.l: failure to timely file federal income tax returns for 2014, 2015, and
2016). Applicant timely filed her federal returns for 2013 and 2014. (AX B at 5-7.) She
filed her federal income tax returns for 2015 and 2016 in August 2018. (AX B at 9-11; AX
E; AX F.)
SOR ¶ 1.m: failure to file state income tax returns for 2014, 2015, 2016.4 As of
the date the record closed, Applicant had not filed her past-due state income tax returns
4 I granted Department Counsel’s motion to amend SOR ¶ 1.m to add an allegation of failure to file a state
income tax return for tax year 2013, delete the allegation of failure to file for 2015 and 2016, and amend
the state for which returns were required. (Tr. 65-68.)
for  2013  and  2014.  (Tr.  31-32.)  A  state  tax  lien  for  $3,428  was  filed  against  her  in
September 2018 for taxes due for tax years 2010, 2011, and 2013. (AX H.) The lien has
not been satisfied.
SOR  ¶  1.n:  tax  debt  totaling  $7,000  for  federal  and  state  income  taxes  for
2014, 2015, and 2016. Applicant’s IRS tax transcript for tax year 2013 reflects a tax debt
of  $7,475.  (AX  B  at  5.)  In  January  2018,  she  told  a  security  investigator  that  the  IRS
calculated her tax debt based on her receipt of an inheritance. (GX 4 at 4.) She did not
produce any documentation from the IRS stating the specific basis for recalculating her
tax debt for 2013. The IRS tax transcript for 2014 reflects that she owed $1,634 for that
year. (AX B at 7.) The transcript for 2015 reflects a zero balance, and the transcript for
2016  reflects  a  balance  of  $2,671.  In  October  2018,  she  wrote  two  letters  to  the  IRS,
challenging  the  computation  of  her  federal  income  tax  for  2013.  (AX  C;  AX  D;  AX  G.)
There is no response from the IRS in the record.
Applicant’s father passed away in September 2011, and she was the appointed to
administer  his  estate.  She  opened  the  estate  in  January  2012  and  completed  the
distribution  of  assets  by  the  end  of  2012.  (Attachment  to  SOR  answer.)  She  received
about  $250,000.  She  distributed  part  of  her  inheritance  by  giving  her  mother  $42,000,
giving her sons $10,000 each, and spending a substantial sum (an amount not specifically
reflected in the record) on renovating and improving her home. (Tr. 53-54.) Although she
hired an accountant and an attorney to help her administer the estate, she has not sought
professional help in resolving the dispute with the IRS. (Tr. 54-57.) She has never sought
or received financial counseling. (Tr. 76.)
Applicant’s take-home pay is about $3,500 per month. She receives $1,100 per
month in disability pay related to her military service. Her monthly expenses are about
$3,280. She has no retirement accounts and no savings. (Tr. 71-72.) She testified that
she has a net monthly remainder of about $1,500. (Tr. 73.) She submitted a budget sheet
after the hearing, reflecting monthly expenses of about $3,320. (AX I.)
In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  stated  that  she  was  unaware  of  the
judgment for the medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e, because she was living in another
state  when  it  was  filed.  At  the  hearing,  she  testified  that  she  was  unaware  of  the
delinquent  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.d  and  1.f-1.k  when  she  submitted  her  SCA,
because she does not review her credit reports, she had sufficient money, she was not
borrowing or opening credit accounts, and she “thought that everything was fine.” (Tr. 79.)
