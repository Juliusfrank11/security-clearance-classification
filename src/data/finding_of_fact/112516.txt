Applicant,  64,  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  federal  contactor,  since
August  2015.  He  previously  held  a  security  clearance  during  his  military  service  from
1975  to  1980.  He  completed  his  most  recent  security  clearance  application  in  August
2017.  He  affirmatively  answered  the  question  about  delinquencies  regarding  routine
accounts,  but  did  not  provide  any  details  about  specific  accounts.  The  ensuing
investigation  revealed  that  he  is  indebted  to  five  creditors  for  approximately  $13,332.
The debts are alleged in the SOR and he admits the allegations.3
Applicant  claims  that  his  financial  problems  began  when  his  17-year  marriage
dissolved  in  2000.  He  claims  that  he  and  his  ex-wife  accumulated  debt  during  the
marriage and that she did not pay her share of the debt. Applicant continued to pay the
joint debts for an unspecified amount of time, but stopped paying at an unspecified date.
He claims that his financial situation worsened in 2011, when he left the job he held for
10 years to become the full-time caregiver for his ailing mother until her death. During
his  four  years  out  of  the  workforce,  Applicant  claims  that  he  depleted  his  savings.  He
also claims that he had a hard time re-entering the work, which he attributes to his age.
He  accepted  his  current  position,  but  at  a  lower  rate  of  pay  than  his  previous
employment.4
The  alleged  debts  remain  unresolved.  The  record  does  not  contain  information
about Applicantâ€™s current finances.
