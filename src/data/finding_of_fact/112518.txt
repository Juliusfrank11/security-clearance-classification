Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  58-year-old  “independent  contractor  for  [the]  State  Department.”
(TR at page 15 line 10 to page 16 line 5, and GX 1 at page 5.) She has been employed
as  an  independent  contractor  since  September  of  2014.  (GX  1  at  page  14.)    She  is
married,  and  has  two  adult  children.  (TR  at  page  16  line  16  to  page  19  line  10.)
Applicant  attributes  her  financial  difficulties  to  her  intermittent  employment,  and  to  her
husband’s poor health, due to heart attacks. (TR at page 26 line 12 to page 27 line 4.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a. Applicant has “settled” her automobile loan with Creditor A, as evidenced by
documentation from Creditor A. (TR at page 25 line 7 to page 26 line 14, at page 27 line
5  to  page  29  line  23,  and  AppX  B  at  page  9.)  This  $20,000  allegation  constitutes  the
majority of Applicant’s alleged past-due indebtedness, and is found for Applicant.
1.b.  Applicant  is  making  monthly  payments  of  $83  towards  an  admitted  $2,962
past-due  debt  to  the  satisfaction  of  Creditor  B,  as  evidenced  by  documentation  from
Creditor B. (AppX B at pages 10~13.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.c,  1.d.,  and  1.f~1.p  Since  July  of  2018,  through  the  auspices  of  a  debt
consolidation  service,  Applicant  is  making  monthly  payments  of  $250  towards  these
thirteen admitted past-due debts totaling about $9,035. (TR at page 19 line 15 to page
25 line 6, and at page 30 line 22 to page 32 line 5.) This is evidenced by documentation
from  her  debt  consolidation  service.  (AppX  B  at  pages  1~7.)  These  allegations  are
found for Applicant.
1.e. Applicant has settled her admitted past-due debt to Creditor E for $494, as
evidenced  by  documentation  from  Creditor  E.  (AppX  D.)  This  allegation  is  found  for
Applicant.
Applicant  performs  her
job  well,  as  evidenced  by  numerous
letters  of
recommendation, citations and achievement awards. (AppX C.)
