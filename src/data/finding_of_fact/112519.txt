Applicant  is  a  44-year-old  program  analyst  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since  January  2017.  She  worked  as  a  site  manager  from  January  2005  to  January
2013, earning about $82,000 per year. She was laid off and unemployed from January
2013  to  April  2013.  (GX  2  at  3.)  She  worked  as  an  office  assistant  in  a  salvage  yard
from March to June 2014, earning about $10 per hour. She moved from another state to
her  current  state  of  domicile  in  June  2014.  She  worked  as  a  data  analyst  from  June
2014  to  December  2015,  earning  about  $72,000  per  year.  She  worked  as  a  program
manager  for  a  federal  contractor  from  December  2015  to  May  2016,  earning  about
$82,000 per year, and she was laid off when this employer’s contracted ended. She was
unemployed  from  June  2016  to  January  2017,  when  she  began  her  current
employment. Her beginning salary with her current employer was $52,000, she received
a  raise  to  $55,000  per  year  about  a  month  before  the  hearing.  (Tr.  28-37.)  She  was
cleared for a public trust position by another government agency in July 2014.
Applicant  was  enrolled  in  an  online  university  from  April  2007  to  January  2012.
She received an associate’s degree in April 2008 and a bachelor’s degree in business
management  in  January  2012.  She  has  about  $175,000  in  student  loans,  which  are
deferred and not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 61-62.)
Applicant has never married. She has three children, ages 22, 20, and 15. She
testified  that  she  was  entitled  to  child  support  for  her  two  older  children,  but  that  their
father  was  about  $50,000  in  arrears,  and  she  has  been  unable  to  collect  it.  She  was
uncertain whether a court order requiring payment of the arrearage is still in effect. (Tr.
59-60.)
The SOR alleges 22 delinquent debts totaling more than $57,000. The debts are
reflected in credit reports from July 2017 and April 2018, and in court records submitted
by  Department  Counsel.  In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  admitted  all  the
allegations.  Her  admissions  in  her  answer  and  at  the  hearing  are  incorporated  in  my
findings of fact. The evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized
below.
1  Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  her  security  clearance  application  (GX  1)  unless
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.

that part of this debt was reduced to judgment, alleged in SOR ¶ 1.l, that the judgment

the remainder of the debt, and that the balance has been reduced to about $6,000. She
submitted  no  documentary  evidence  to  support  her  testimony.  (Tr.  39-40.)  The  April
2018 credit report reflects that the creditor for this debt is the same as the plaintiff in the
judgment alleged in SOR ¶ 1.l. The credit report reflects that this collection  account is
for attorney’s fees and “outstanding balance.”
