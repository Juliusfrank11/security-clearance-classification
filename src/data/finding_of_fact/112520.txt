In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  with  comments  two  of  the  three
factual  allegations  pertaining  to  financial  considerations  of  the  SOR  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  and
1.b.). Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact.
After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the  evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  a  director  of  field  applications  with  his  employer  since  September  2016.  He  was
previously an owner of a construction corporation from August 2012 until December 2015.
A  1997  high  school  graduate,  Applicant  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2001  and  a
master’s  degree  in 2009.  He has never served  with  the  U.S. military.  He  never held  a
security clearance. He was married in 2004. He has two sons, born in 2007 and 2012.
Financial Considerations1
There  was  nothing  unusual  about  Applicant’s  finances  until  2014.  Applicant’s
company merged with another company in late 2012, and he became the co-owner and
operator of a small real estate development firm organized as an S corporation. Together
with two partners, they shared equally in the income, liabilities, and management of the
corporation. The company was doing rather well financially, and in early 2014, it had eight
residential  and  commercial  properties  in  various  stages  of  construction.  There  were
approximately  $1,000,000  in  outstanding  gross  billings  and  approximately  $175,000  in
outstanding short-term liabilities associated primarily with labor and materials for those
jobs.2 In January 2014, Applicant’s two partners unexpectedly decided to abandon the
business, leaving him with the liabilities. They were removed from the corporation.3 He
later determined that that they had improperly and secretly bid against the corporation
under  a  company  name  they  had  created,  and  had  charged  personal  expenses  and
expenses for their secret company to the corporate account, and had already delivered
$25,000 to $35,000 in upgrades to customers without Applicant’s knowledge.
Applicant  focused  on  attempting  to  complete  the  construction  jobs  that  were
unfinished.  Two  of  the  families,  with  about  75  percent  of  the  work  on  their  respective
houses  completed,  and  final  inspections  performed,  stopped  making  payments.  The
unpaid  balances  totaled  approximately  $150,000.  Applicant  filed  liens.  He  sued  one
family  in  arbitration  for  $93,000,  but  only  received  $13,000  after  arbitration  in  August
2015.4  Those  funds  went  back  to  the  corporation  to  pay  off  debts.  He  sued  another
homeowner,  and  in  December  2017,  he  received  a  judgment  for  $43,000,  plus  court
costs.5 He did not actually receive the funds until nearly a year later. Applicant worked
three  jobs:  building  homes  and  as  an  information  technology  consultant,  in  order  to
generate  the  funds  necessary  to  resolve  the  debts  that  resulted  from  his  ex-partners’
actions  and  the  refusal  of  his  customers  to  timely  pay  their  bills.  However,  it  was  the
actions  of  his  bank  in  2015  that  resulted  in  the  most  lasting  damage  to  his  financial
situation.
Applicant and one of his customers happened to use the same bank. His customer
wrote him a check for approximately $54,500 one Friday afternoon in August 2015, and
Applicant deposited it into his account. That evening, Applicant’s account details reflected

that the funds were available. The following Tuesday, the funds were removed from the
account by the bank without Applicant’s knowledge or authorization, eventually causing
several  of  his  checks  to  bounce.  Applicant’s  efforts  to  have  the  funds  restored  were
successful, and the funds were put back into his account on Friday. Applicant’s personal
banker at the bank and the branch manager even acknowledged that the re-deposit was
made with no holds on the deposit, and they explained that the issue developed because
of  internal  bank  processing  difficulties.  Unfortunately,  during  the  week  of  the  missing
funds, Applicant’s laborers refused to show up for work because payments could not be
guaranteed.  For  the  third  time,  the  bank  again  removed  the  funds  from  Applicant’s
account without his knowledge or authorization, and once again Applicant had several
more checks bounce. The experience and the delays cost Applicant roughly four weeks
of  production  on  a  commercial  project,  and  his  cash-flow  was  negatively  impacted.  In
October 2015, Applicant requested a $20,000 credit line from that same bank so he could
have  sufficient  funds  to  complete  two  construction  projects  and  have  approximately
$155,000  in  receivables  released  to  him,  but  the  bank  rejected  his  request.6  Although
Applicant estimated that the bank measures cost him $200,000, and the bank denied any
liability  for  its  actions,  the  bank  settled  Applicant’s  claims,  and  it  agreed  to  pay  him
$55,000 in September 2016.7
Applicant debated whether or not to sue his former partners for fraud, but based
on estimated legal costs of up to $30,000, he decided not to do so.8 Because of the impact
on his finances, Applicant was not in a position to make more timely payments to his two
creditors, but he did contact them in an effort to establish repayment plans or settlements.
On January 17, 2017, the first such repayment plan was agreed to, and Applicant started
making monthly $500 payments. Payments were made as agreed, and in August 2018,
the account was satisfied. In May 2018, based on settlement offers, Applicant presented
repayment plans to his remaining creditor, the holder of two of his delinquent accounts.9
The SOR identified  three purportedly delinquent accounts that had been placed
for collection or charged-off, as generally reflected by Applicant’s July 2017 or January
2018 credit reports. Those debts total approximately $56,139. The current status of those
accounts is as follows:
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): This is a bank loan with a high credit of $30,000 and an unpaid and
past-due  balance  of  $23,920,  of  which  $22,638  was  charged  off  in  March  2016.10
Applicant reached out to the creditor and agreed to a settlement in the amount of $9,560.
He  offered  to  start  making  monthly  payments  of  $300  or  more,  but  the  bank  wanted

something like $800.11 In October 2018, Applicant sold some real estate for $195,000,
with an estimated net receipt of $177,975.12 He contacted the creditor the day before the
sale,  and  expects  to  use  funds  from  the  sale  to  resolve  the  debt.13  There  is  no
documentary evidence of any payments on the account since the sale. The account has
not been resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): This is a bank-issued credit card with a high credit of $22,638 and
an  unpaid  and  past-due  balance  of  $20,219  that  was  charged  off  in  June  2016.14
Applicant reached out to the creditor and agreed to a settlement in the amount of $8,088.

documentary evidence of any payments on the account since the sale. The account has
not been resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): This is an unspecified type of account with a past-due and unpaid
balance of $12,000 that was placed for collection.18 Applicant set up a payment plan with
the creditor calling for monthly $500 payments. Payments were made as agreed, and in
August  2018,  the  account  was  satisfied.19  To  date,  there  should  be  two  completed
preauthorized payments. The account has been resolved.
In addition to the accounts alleged in the SOR, Applicant addressed various other
accounts  that  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  For  example,  he  had  to  resolve  all  of  the
disputes, debts, and litigation caused by the actions of his two former partners and his
bank’s  unusual  dysfunctional  activities.20  Other  than  the  accounts  alleged  in  the  SOR,
Applicant is not aware of any other delinquent accounts, and his most recent credit report
does  not  reflect  any  additional  delinquencies.  In  March  2018,  Applicant  prepared  a

dry. He respects Applicant on how he has handled himself in becoming financially stable
again, and he considers Applicant to be trustworthy, honest, and loyal.24
A certified public accountant has known Applicant since 2004, as both a friend and

outstanding  business  debts.  He  considers  Applicant  to  be  a  person  of  integrity  with  a
strong desire to always do the right thing.25
