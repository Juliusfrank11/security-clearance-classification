Applicant denied all of the allegations in the SOR. The credit reports dated April 3,
2018, and October 27, 2017, establish the allegations. (Item 4; Item 5.) After a thorough

1998 and February 2012, and was honorably discharged. He is divorced since 2008 and
resides with a cohabitant. He listed four children born in 1999, 2002, 2008, and 2013 on
his security clearance application. (Item 3; Item 6.)
In 2014, Applicant learned he fathered a fifth child, born in 2001, which he forgot
to disclose on his security clearance application. Applicant attributed his delinquencies to
the garnishment of his wages for support of that child, and child support payments for
other children totaling $1,290.46 monthly. He also attributed his debts to unemployment
