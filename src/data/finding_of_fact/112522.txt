Applicant  is  45  years  old.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1996.  He  is  not
currently married, but he has been with his girlfriend for over 20 years, and they have four
children between the ages of 12 and 23. The oldest daughter is not Applicant’s biological
daughter, but he claims her as his own child. Since June 1996, he has been employed
full time for different defense contractors, with no periods of unemployment. He currently
works as a senior systems administrator, and he has held a DOD security clearance since
1996. His annual salary is approximately $82,000. (Tr. 10-11, 22, 37-39, 76; GE 1)
Financial Considerations
Applicant has suffered financial problems over a long period of time. He filed for a
Chapter  13  bankruptcy  in  2008  when  his  residence  was  going  into  foreclosure.  In
approximately 2013, he finalized his Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Shortly after the bankruptcy
was finalized, he suffered financial problems due to being the only source of income for
a large family. Additionally, Applicant had to pay taxes in tax year 2015 for the $25,000
his  mortgage  holder  forgave  from  his  mortgage.  The  1099  placed  him  in  a  higher  tax
bracket, and he could not pay the taxes he owed to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
(Tr. 42-44)
In 2008, Applicant changed his tax withholding status with his employer’s payroll
office on the advice of his bankruptcy attorney. After his bankruptcy was finalized in 2013,
Applicant  did  not  update  his  tax  withholding  status,  and  continued  to  have  insufficient
taxes  deducted from  his paycheck.  This pattern  continued for a  number of  years  to  at
least 2016. He admitted that he always filed his state and Federal tax returns timely, but
he was unable to pay the amount of taxes due with his income tax filings. Applicant also
cashed out his 401K from a previous employer, which contributed to his tax issues.  He
used the money to remodel his house and pay for his daughter’s graduation party. (Tr.
17, 51-53, 80-81; GE 1, GE 5)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant owes $4,860 for a personal loan he took out in
about 2015 to have new floors put into his home. He was to make monthly payments of
about $145 for two years with 0% interest. He made one payment and did not make any
other  payments.  Applicant  contacted  the  creditor  the  day  before  his  hearing.  He
requested  a  settlement  offer  and  was  waiting  for  settlement  documentation.  Applicant
planned to make payments in the near future to settle this account, and he indicated he
would  provide  documentation  within  the  one-month  period  the  record  was  to  be  held
open. On April 24, 2019, Applicant provided a copy of a settlement offer from the creditor.
The letter dated March 22, 2019, showed that the creditor was willing to accept $2,916.25,
but the payment would have to be made by the March 29, 2019, or the settlement offer
would be null and void. Applicant failed to provide any documentation showing that he
settled this account. This debt has not been resolved.  (Tr. 45-46; GE 2, GE 3, GE 4; AE
N)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that Applicant owes $2,154 for a credit card account charged-
off as a bad debt. SOR ¶ 1.i is a duplicate of the same credit card debt that eventually
resulted in a judgment filed against him in 2018. Applicant provided documentation that
he settled this credit card debt after making two $800 payments in late 2018. The debt
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b, and duplicated in ¶ 1.i, has been settled for less than the full value
of the alleged debt. (Tr. 46-48; GE 3; AE E)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  that  Applicant  owes  $927  for  a  utility  account  referred  for
collection. Applicant made a $50 payment on this account a few days before his hearing,
and he had just recently returned equipment to the creditor. He testified that the creditor
needed  to  recalculate  the  balance  of  his  account,  and  he  would  provide  updated
documentation within the one-month period the record was to be held open. On April 24,
2019,  Applicant  provided  a  copy  of  the  creditor’s  statement  showing  that  another  $50
payment  was  received  in  April  2019,  and  $290.27  was  credited  to  the  account  for  the
returned equipment. As of the date the record closed, the remaining balance owed to this
creditor was $536.28. (Tr. 48-49; GE 3, GE 4; AE G, AE O)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges that Applicant owes $141 for his car insurance. He provided
documentation  with  his  SOR  response  showing  that  he paid  this debt. This delinquent
account has been resolved. (GE 3, GE 4)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  that  Applicant  owes  $102  for  a  medical  account  referred  for
collection. Applicant provided a receipt with his SOR response showing that this account
was paid.  This delinquent account has been resolved. (Tr. 49-50; GE 3)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges that Applicant owes $21,777 in delinquent Federal income taxes
for tax years 2015 and 2016. Applicant stated he was in a repayment agreement with the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS), but he fell behind on his monthly payments. He usually
initiates a new repayment agreement with the IRS every year after tax season. At some
point after the agreement plan is established, he finds he in unable to continue with the
repayment plan. Applicant planned to obtain a new payment agreement with the IRS in
April 2019. At the hearing, he indicated that he would provide documentation of his past
tax payment history while the record was held open in his case. Applicant failed to provide
documentation of his payment history with the IRS by the time the record closed. This
Federal tax debt is outstanding, and is not currently being paid. (Tr. 50-56, 75-76; GE 5)
As of May 2018, the IRS tax transcript for tax  year 2015 showed that Applicant
owed $14,353. His 2016 tax transcript showed that his delinquent tax debt was $7,424.21.
Applicant’s 2017 tax refund was intercepted and applied to his delinquent accounts owed
for tax years 2013, 2014, and the remainder of $1,917 was applied to 2015. (Tr. 75; GE
5)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges that Applicant owes $2,466 for a state tax lien entered against
him in 2017. Applicant believed the balance should now be around $1,500 since his 2017
state  tax  refund  was  intercepted  to  pay  this  tax  debt.  Applicant  failed  to  provide  any
documentation  by  the  close  of  the  record  to  support  his  claim.  The  state  tax  debt  is
outstanding, and the lien has not been released. (Tr. 56; GE 6)
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges that Applicant owes the city in which he resides approximately
$9,000 for unpaid real estate taxes for tax years 2008 through 2016. Applicant  stopped
paying his mortgage, which included escrow, when he filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy. After
his bankruptcy was finalized, he did not make any real estate  tax payments to the city,
even though he received delinquent real estate tax notices. He admitted that he had been
on a payment plan at one time, but the payment plan was withdrawn after he did not make
timely payments. Applicant did not made any payments on this account for a long period
of time until the day before his hearing when he made a $50 payment on an account that
now totaled $12,000, with accruing interest and penalties. The city tax debt has not been
resolved. (Tr. 57-58; GE 2; AE I, AE J)
Applicant cashed out his unused vacation pay in December 2018 for approximately
$2,300. He used the money to provide Christmas gifts to his family instead of paying off
delinquent debt. Applicant does not have a monthly budget established, he does not have
a savings account, and he has not participated in any financial counseling. He admitted
that he still owes about $20,000 for his student loans, but he recently requested a student
loan forbearance. Applicant also admitted that he does not always pay his utilities in full
each month, but he has made payment arrangements with his utility creditors to prevent
his utilities being shut off. (Tr. 58-64, 76-77, 79-81; AE F)
Alcohol
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges that Applicant was arrested in March 2015 for speeding and
operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol (OVI). Applicant admitted that he pled
guilty to the OVI charge, and the speeding charge was dismissed. He was arrested while
driving to the casino with his poker friends. Applicant was required to attend a three-day
alcohol awareness course. (Tr. 65-66, GE 1, GE 2, GE 8)
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges that Applicant was arrested in May 2016 and charged with OVI
and physical control. Applicant admitted that he was guilty of the physical control charge
only. He had been at a bar watching a sporting event and drinking alcohol. He felt fine
when  he  left  the  bar. His  home  was  about  seven  miles  away. While  driving,  Applicant
realized that he could be arrested for OVI, so he pulled over and fell asleep in his car.
The police arrived and arrested him. He was fined and paid court costs, and placed on
five years of community control. (Tr. 66-68; GE 1, GE 2, GE 8)
SOR ¶ 2.c alleges that Applicant was arrested in April 2018 for physical control of
vehicle  while  under  the  influence  of  alcohol.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  was  initially
charged  with  physical  control,  but  he  pled  guilty  to  an  amended  charge  of  reckless
operation. He admitted that he had consumed alcohol and was trying to reconcile with his
girlfriend when he was arrested. (Tr. 69-70; GE 8)
Misuse of Prescription Drugs
During Applicant’s April 2018 arrest, the police found a green pill in his possession.
It  was  determined  that  the  green  pill  was  “Xanax.”  Since  Applicant  did  not  have  a
prescription for the Xanax, he was also charged with possession of a drug (Schedule IV).
This  charge  was  subsequently  dismissed.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  obtained  Xanax
from his friend, and that he had used Xanax without a valid prescription on three or four
occasions while he possessed a DOD security clearance. Applicant said he obtained the
prescription drug to help him sleep. He has participated in security briefings over the years
and he is aware that using a prescription drug without a valid prescription is against DOD
policy.  (Tr. 71-74; 85-87; GE 2)
Character Evidence
Applicant’s girlfriend testified at the hearing. She confirmed Applicant is the sole
source of income for the family. She observed his continuing efforts to pay the delinquent
bills. She does not believe he is dependent on alcohol or illegal drugs. She testified that
she is not currently employed, but she is currently searching for employment, and is also
considering going back to school. (Tr. 89-94; AE)
Applicant  provided  four  character  reference  letters  at  the  hearing.  One  of  the
references stated: “To the best of my knowledge, [Applicant] has never broken any laws
and has always been courteous and kind to co-workers and those in authority.” (AE B)
None of the character references mentioned that they were aware of the security issues
alleged  in  Applicant’s  SOR.  All  four  character  references  recommended  Applicant  be
granted a top secret security clearance. (AE A, AE B, AE C, AE D)
