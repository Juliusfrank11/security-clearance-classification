various locations since 1996. (Tr. 50) He is highly respected on the job. According to a
former supervisor, he was an excellent employee who worked day and night. Moreover, “if

In January 2014, a lien was entered against Applicant’s property for unpaid Federal
income taxes from tax years 2006 to 2008, totaling $87,950, as alleged in subparagraph
1.d. (GE P at 4) There are no allegations that Applicant did not file his 2006 or 2007 federal
tax returns on time. The record evidence indicates that, contrary to the allegation set forth
in SOR subparagraph 1.b, Applicant did file his 2008 federal income tax return on time.
(GE 2 at 17) Applicant contends that the debt from these years stemmed from an audit
conducted a few years later that revealed that he owed more than he paid when he filed
the income tax returns. Specifically, as a contractor, Applicant files his federal income tax
returns  using  a  1099  form.  (Tr.  109)  Applicant  owed  additional  money  after  the  IRS
disallowed the business expenses that he claimed.  (Tr. 111)
Applicant satisfied his 2008 Federal income tax delinquency with  two payments
made in March 2019, totaling $39,363. (AE B at 3-5) It is unknown from the record whether
he has satisfied the tax delinquency from 2006 and 2007. Moreover, the evidence that the
federal tax lien for tax years 2006 through 2008 (subparagraph 1.d) has been released is
inconclusive.
Applicant filed his 2009 federal and state income tax returns on time, contrary to the
allegation set forth in subparagraph 1.b. (AE B, AE T at 3; Tr. 60) He paid a $5,003 federal

returns until February 2016, (AE D at 1; AE E at 1); he did not file his 2013 income tax
return until June 2015, (AE F at 1);  he did not file his 2014 income tax return until May

Applicant’s payment of his 2010 tax delinquency resulted in the release of a lien against his
property,  as  alleged  in  subparagraph  1.d,  in  March  2019.  (AE  O)  He  made  the  tax
payments with his credit card. At the end of each month that he made the payments, he
would typically pay his credit card balance, using money drawn from either his savings
account, or his checking account. (Tr. 72, 75, 98) His credit and retail card debt totals
approximately $140,000. (AE K at 3; AE l at 2) All of his accounts are current.
In March 2019, Applicant requested a transcript of all of the state income tax returns
that had outstanding delinquencies.  (Tr. 93) Per the transcript, he owed $4,777 for tax
year 2014 and $2,265 for tax year 2015. (AE N at 1) Applicant paid the balance for tax year
2015 on March 20, 2019. (AE N at 3) He is making monthly $311 payments on the 2014

In April 2015, a lien was entered against Applicant’s property for delinquent 2010
state income taxes totaling $3,333, as alleged in subparagraph 1.i. This lien was released
in June 2018 after Applicant paid the delinquency. (AE P at 1)
Applicant attributes his failure to file or pay his federal and state income taxes timely
to the deterioration of his second marriage, followed by his 2014 divorce and the ensuing
litigation that began when he filed for full custody of their child in December 2017. (AE Q at
4). Their marriage began deteriorating shortly Applicant’s wife had their child in 2012. (Tr.
53)  Their separation was particularly bitter because Applicant raised allegations that his
second  wife  was  physically  abusing  their  daughter.  Fearing  for  his  daughter’s  safety,
Applicant spared no expense during the divorce proceedings, hiring one of the best family
law attorneys in the state, who told him that his legal fees would range between $100,000
and $150,000. (Tr. 123)  Applicant then began saving money to pay the attorney. Some of
the money ordinarily would have been set aside to pay income taxes. (Tr. 54-56)
In  2013,  Applicant  went  on  a  tropical  cruise.  (Tr.  119;  GE  1  at  29)  He  spent
approximately $5,000. (Tr. 120) In late 2014, approximately nine months after his divorce
from his second wife was finalized, Applicant traveled out of the country to visit his current
wife’s family.  His in-laws paid for most of the expenses. He spent approximately $1,400.
Applicant earns $113,000 per year. He has approximately $15,000 deposited in a
savings account, and $15,000 invested in a 401k plan. (Tr. 126) He has $2,000 of monthly
discretionary income.
