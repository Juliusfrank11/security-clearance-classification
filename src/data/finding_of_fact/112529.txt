In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, 2.b through
2.e, and 3.a through 3.e. (HE 3) He also provided extenuating and mitigating information.
(HE 3) Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact
follow.
Applicant is a 43-year-old aircraft maintenance specialist in flight test mechanics
who has been employed by the same defense contractor since 2007. (Tr. 10, 13, 27) In
1995,  he  graduated  from  high  school.  (Tr.  10)  He  attended  college  for  several  years;
however, he did not receive a degree. (Tr. 10) He served in the Navy from 1998 to 2001,
and he received a general discharge under honorable conditions. (Tr. 10-11) In 2001, he
married; in 2010, he separated from his spouse; and in 2012, he divorced. (Tr. 11-12, 28)
His children are ages 13 and 16. (Tr. 12)
Financial Considerations
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b allege Applicant owes federal income taxes of $19,010 for tax
year 2011 and $5,096 for tax year 2012. He filed his 2011 and 2012 federal income tax
returns in April 2013. (Tr. 29-30) He has been aware that he owed federal income taxes
since April 2013. (Tr. 30) More details about his payments to address delinquent taxes
are contained in this section, infra.
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.f allege Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state M tax
returns for tax years 2013 through 2016. He said he filed his 2013 through 2016 federal
and state M tax returns in 2019. (Tr. 31) However, he might have filed those tax returns
in  the  last  half  of  2018,  based  on  the  payments  he  made  after  June  2018,  and  his
response  to  DOHA  interrogatories  indicating  he  planned  to  file  his  tax  returns  in  June
2018. (GE 2) Filing was somewhat delayed by a flood around 2012 and 2013 and possibly
by his divorce, which was final in 2012. (Tr. 31)
SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e allege Applicant owes state M income taxes as follows: $5,537
for tax year 2003; and a total of $10,572 for tax years 2011 and 2012. SOR ¶ 1.g alleges
in March 2014, a state M tax lien was filed against Applicant for $7,597. On September
21, 2018, Applicant paid the state M tax authority $20,000 by cashier’s check, and state
M  released  the  hold  on  Applicant’s  driver’s  license.  (AE  J;  AE  K)  In  October  2018,
Applicant paid the state M tax authority a total of $7,934 by cashier’s checks. (AE L; AE
M) He currently has a 2018 state M tax debt of $11,928, which is not alleged in the SOR.
(Tr. 39) He has not made any payments to address his 2018 state M tax debt. (Tr. 40)

Applicant’s annual salary is about $85,000. (Tr. 28) On May 1, 2019, the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) wrote Applicant and established a payment plan to address his
tax debts for tax years 2011, 2012, 2015, 2016, and 2017. (AE A) It is unclear why some
of the tax years were not listed that are depicted  as delinquent in the above table. For
example, the federal tax debt for tax year 2018 of $36,082 does not appear to have been
included in the installment agreement. Applicant’s federal tax debt for 2018 was $36,082,
which  resulted  from  withdrawals  from  his  401(k)  account,  which  has  been  almost
exhausted. (Tr. 36-37, 71) According to the May 1, 2019 IRS installment agreement, his
monthly payments were supposed to be $1,000 with the first payment due on May 25,
2019. (AE A) He provided page 1 of the agreement. (AE A) In May 2019, he paid $100;
in June 2019, he paid $200; and in July 2019, he paid $100. (AE B) He is renegotiating
the payment plan because he believed the IRS erred and overestimated his gross annual
income or ability to pay the tax debt. (Tr. 35) He planned to pay the IRS $200 a month
until the monthly payment to the IRS is renegotiated. (Tr. 36-37)
On April 29, 2019, Applicant paid the IRS $42,463, which was used to address his
tax debt for 2012. (Tr. 32, 65; AE B) From December 3, 2018 to July 8, 2019, he made
one  payment  of  $3,563, one  payment  of  $2,022,  six  payments from $1,000  to $2,000,
and seven payments from $100 to $500 during this time period. (AE B) He estimated that
he  owed  the  federal  government  about  $65,000  after  he  was  credited  for  his  $42,463
payment when his home was refinanced. (Tr. 32-35, 37) He hopes to net about $45,000
on the sale of his residence, and he wants to use those funds to pay his tax debt. (Tr. 38)
He  is  also  working  overtime  to  obtain  additional  income  to  address  his  delinquent  tax
debt. (Tr. 40)
Alcohol Consumption and Personal Conduct
SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 3.a allege that around 1999, Applicant was charged with driving
under  the  influence  of  alcohol  (DUI),  and  in  2000,  he  was  charged  with  driving  while
license suspended. (Tr. 40-41, 45, 64) He received deferred prosecution for five years for
the DUI, and the DUI charge was later dismissed after his successful completion of his
probation; however, he was convicted of driving with a suspended license. (Tr. 41) His
driver’s license was suspended for one year. (Tr. 41-42)
SOR  ¶  2.b  alleges  in  May  2000  while  Applicant  was  in  the  Navy,  he  received
disciplinary action for failure to obey an order. Applicant violated the order of a chief petty
officer who told him to remove his sunglasses when he was on a vessel. (Tr. 43; GE 6 at
32) He had consumed alcohol ashore before the incident. (Tr. 44) He received nonjudicial
punishment for disobeying the order of the chief petty officer. (Tr. 44)
SOR  ¶  2.c.  alleges  in  September 2001,  Applicant  received  a  general  discharge
from  the  Navy  due  to  alcohol  rehabilitation  failure.  After  the  1999  DUI,  Applicant
volunteered to attend alcohol counseling. (Tr. 45) After the incident with the chief petty
officer in 2000, Applicant was discharged from the Navy for alcohol rehabilitation failure.
(Tr. 45-47)
SOR  ¶  3.b  alleges
in  December  2001,  Applicant  was  charged  with
assault/domestic violence. He struggled with his spouse and took the keys to his truck
from her. (Tr. 48-49) He conceded under state law the struggle constituted assault. (Tr.
49) He was not under the influence of alcohol. (Tr. 48) He attended anger management;
he was convicted of assault; and he received probation for two years. (Tr. 47-49)
SOR ¶ 3.c alleges in June 2007, Applicant was charged with petty theft/shoplifting.
He  wanted  to  purchase  sunglasses  at a military  exchange.  (Tr.  49-50) A  sales  person
would not assist him with the purchase. (Tr. 49-51) According to the January 29, 2008
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), he took the tag
off of the sunglasses and left his old sunglasses on the counter. (GE 2 at 67-68) During
his February 14, 2013, and January 18, 2018 OPM PSIs, and at his hearing, he said he
put some money on the counter, and then he took the sunglasses. (Tr. 51; GE 2 at 77,
85) The January 29, 2008 OPM PSI does not mention that he left money on the counter
for the sunglasses. (GE 2 at 67-68) The theft charge was dismissed after he completed
40 hours of community service. (Tr. 52; GE 2 at 67-68)
SOR ¶ 3.d alleges in February 2009, Applicant was charged with second degree
assault  of  his  spouse.  Applicant  was  upset because  his spouse  was mismanaging  the
family finances. (Tr. 52) Applicant took her phone from her and threw it against the wall.
(Tr. 52) When he took her phone, he grabbed her arm and left a red mark on her wrist.
(Tr. 53) She did not testify against Applicant, and the charge was dismissed. (Tr. 53)
SOR ¶ 2.d alleges in June 2012, Applicant was charged with operating a vehicle
while under the influence of alcohol (OWI). (Tr. 54-55) A police officer stopped him for
speeding and gave him a breath alcohol test (BAT) because they could smell tequila on
his breath. (Tr. 56) His BAT result exceeded .08. (Tr. 56) He pleaded guilty to this offense
and  received  five  years  of  probation  before  judgment,  and  he  completed  an  alcohol-
education  class.  (Tr.  57-58)  After  successful  completion  of  probation,  the  charge  was
dismissed. (Tr. 57) He was allowed to consume alcohol during probation. (Tr. 57-59)
SOR  ¶  3.e  alleges  in  January  2014,  Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  on  a
suspended  license.  His  case  was  placed  on  the  Stet  docket.  He  explained  that  he
completed  all  requirements  for  reinstatement  of  his  driver’s  license,  and  the  state
erroneously failed to completely process and reinstate his driver’s license. (Tr. 59) The
charge was dismissed. (Tr. 59-60)
SOR ¶ 2.e alleges in June 2017, Applicant was charged with disorderly conduct.
He  was  subsequently  convicted  of  disturbing  the  peace/obstruct  public  area.  He  had
consumed  alcohol  prior  to  this  arrest.  Applicant  and  a  friend  were  wrestling  or
“roughhousing,”  and  Applicant  fell  and  cut  his  head  on  some  concrete.  (Tr.  60-61)
Applicant had consumed a beer before the wrestling occurred. (Tr. 60) Applicant and his
friend were taken to jail. (Tr. 61) Applicant said his conviction was equivalent to a traffic
infraction. (Tr. 62)
SOR ¶ 3.f alleges the same information that is in SOR ¶¶ 2.a through 2.e. Applicant
has not been charged with any offenses since June 2017, and he is not on probation. (Tr.
63) Applicant has not consumed sufficient alcohol to the extent to become intoxicated for
about two years. (Tr. 68-69) He ended his alcohol consumption almost one year ago. (Tr.
