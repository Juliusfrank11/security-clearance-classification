Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR ¶ 1.a, that she was $33,395 in
arrears in her $305,325 mortgage, which was in a foreclosure status. Her admission to
the  SOR  allegation,  and  those  at  her  hearing,  are  incorporated  herein  as  findings  of
fact.  After  a  thorough  review  of  the  record  evidence,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  41-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  She  recently
completed  an  associate’s  degree  and  is  currently  pursuing  her  bachelor’s  degree.
Applicant married in 2004 and divorced in 2013. She has no children.
Applicant worked as a personnel security specialist for a federal law enforcement
agency  between  2005  and  2012.  She  was  unemployed  between  June  2012  and  April
2014. She worked for a federal contractor between April 2014 and February 2015, and
was  unemployed  between  February  and  August  2015.  She  worked  for  a  federal
contractor  between  August  2015  and  March  2016.  Her  current  employer,  a  federal
contractor, hired Applicant in March 2016 and is currently sponsoring the continuation of
her clearance. She is a personnel security assistant. (Tr. 23)
Applicant  was  first  granted  a  clearance  when  she  was  a  stay-in-school  student
working  for  the  federal  agency  in  1999.  She  did  not  remember  the  level  of  her  first
clearance,  but  stated  that  the  DOD  granted  her  a  top-secret  clearance  in  2002,  and
subsequently other agencies granted her secret clearances related to her duties. (GE 1)
Applicant submitted a SCA in March 2010. (GE 7) She disclosed in her answers
to  Section 26  (Financial  Record)  that she  had financial  problems within  the  last  seven
years,  including:  filing  for  bankruptcy  in  2003;  having  a  house  (purchased  in  February
2006)  foreclosed  in  September  2008;  and  having  delinquent  debts  in  collection.
Applicant explained that “due to the mortgage note being so high ($2,800 a month) my
spouse and I had to walk. No financial companies would refinance the loan.” She also
explained  her  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  was  discharged  in  2003.  She  noted  that  she
currently had some delinquent debts because her spouse has been unemployed since
October 2009. (GE 7, Section 26)
The SOR concerns a single debt, a delinquent mortgage. (SOR ¶ 1.a) Applicant
claimed she was delinquent in her mortgage payments because she was lied to during
the  purchase  of  the  house  in  2016.  She  was  told  the  mortgage  payment  would  be
$1,300,  when  in  fact,  the  note  payment  was  $1,600.  She  claimed  she  did  not  know
anything about escrow funds or any additional expenses for insurance and taxes. She
could  not  afford  the  additional  mortgage  payments.  She  made  two  or  three  mortgage
payments  following  the  purchase  of  the  house,  and  she  then  stopped  paying  the
mortgage in August 2016, because she had other living expenses to pay. Additionally,
Applicant  testified  that  she  could  not  afford  the  mortgage  payments  because  she
provided  financial  support  to  her  mother  in  an  as-needed  basis  and  incurred  financial
expenses  related  to  the  death  of  an  unidentified  family  member.  She  provided  no
documentary evidence to support these last two claims.
At  her  hearing,  Applicant  admitted  that  she  previously  purchased  a  house  in
2006  that  was  foreclosed  for  lack  of  payments  in  2008.  She  claimed  that  she  did  not
learn  anything  about  escrow  accounts  from  owning  that  property  because  the  note
payments  were  automatically  drafted  from  her  bank  account.  Applicant  earns  close  to
$21  an  hour.  Her  monthly  take  home  pay  is  about  $2,500.  She  testified  that  she
submitted several requests for a mortgage modification to the original creditor and to at
least  two  subsequent  mortgage  account  holders.  Her  last  modification  request  is
currently pending with the most recent mortgage note holder.
Although she is living  in the house, Applicant has made no mortgage payments
since  August  2016.  During  2017,  she  took  in  a  renter  for  a  period  of  eight  months  to
increase her earnings to pay the mortgage. The renter paid her $850 a month, for a total
of  $6,800.  Applicant  claimed  she  saved  $1,000  from  the  renter’s  income  to  pay  her
mortgage.  She  presented  no  documentary  evidence  of  any  mortgage  payments  made
since August 2016. She claimed that she used the rent income to pay other debts and
old payday loans that she and her ex-husband incurred while married.
Applicant  testified  that  she  has  been  talking  to  telecommunication  service
providers,  her  home  security  service  company,  and  other  utility  companies  seeking  to
reduce  the  services  she  receives,  or  to  cancel  her  service  contracts,  in  an  effort  to
reduce her expenses and be able to afford her mortgage payments. She presented no
documentary evidence of these efforts.
Applicant noted that she purchased a 2018 car for about $23,000 in 2017, with a
monthly  payment  of  about  $600.  After  realizing  she  was  having  difficulty  making  the
monthly  payments,  she  traded  in  the  2018  car  for  a  2007  luxury  car  that  cost  her
$12,000, with a monthly payment of $316. (Tr. 32-36)
Applicant  has  not  participated  in  financial  counseling.  She  averred  she  is
currently  following  a  budget,  but  provided  no  documentary  evidence  to  support  her
claim.  She  promised  to  take  herself  out  of  debt  by  concentrating  on  paying  her
mortgage  first,  and  then  addressing  her  remaining  debts.  She  claimed  she  has  been
looking for a second job to increase her earning since 2016. As of her hearing date, she
had  not  found  any  job  opportunities.  She  promised  to  repair  her  credit  and  to  be
financially responsible in the future.
The  SOR  was  issued  under  Executive  Order  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified
Information  Within  Industry  (February  20,  1960),  as  amended;  DOD  Directive  5220.6,
