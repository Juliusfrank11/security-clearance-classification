Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since 2012. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1992
until  he  retired  in  2012.  He  is  a  high  school  graduate.  He  is  married  with  an  adult
stepchild.1
Applicant  did  not  file his  federal income  tax  returns  when  they  were  due  for  tax
years 2011 through 2016. His mother passed away in 2011, and he inherited an annuity
of  less  than  $10,000.  His  father  and  brother  were  upset  that  they  did  not  inherit
anything. His father threatened to disown Applicant if he did not sell the annuity and split
it with his father and brother. Applicant sold the annuity, which may have created a tax
liability,  and  split  the  results  with  his  father  and  brother.  He  was  overwhelmed  by  the
loss of his mother and the strain placed on him by his family, and he did not feel that he
was  competent  to  prepare  his  federal  income  tax  return.  Rather  than  hire  someone  to
prepare the return, he simply did nothing.2
Applicant  thought  he  had  to  file  the  2011  tax  return  before  he  filed  subsequent
years, and he did not file federal income tax returns for another five years. His wife was
diagnosed with cancer, which also contributed to his failure to fulfill his obligations.3
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
April 2017. He reported that he did not file his 2011 federal income tax return, but he did
not report his failure to file the additional years. He wrote that the estimated amount of
taxes  owed  was  $45,000,  and  that  he  was  “Working  with  the  IRS  to  resolve/Monthly
payments.” He also reported derogatory information under a different section.4
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  August  2017.  He
discussed his tax issues. He stated that he did not report the additional tax years on the
SF 86 because he was unsure how to do so. He told the investigator that the $45,000
figure on the SF 86 was his income for 2011, and it did not reflect the taxes owed for
that year. He stated that he recently contacted tax professionals to file his tax returns,
and he would then pay the IRS what he owes.5 After considering all the evidence, I find
that Applicant did not intentionally provide false information on the SF 86.
Applicant  provided  documentation  in  his  response  to  the  SOR  that  he  retained
tax  professionals.  He  asserted  that  the  federal  tax  returns  for  2011  through  2016  had
been filed. He stated that he paid the IRS $15,910 as payment in full for tax years 2009

and 2010. He also indicated that when the IRS determines how much he owes for 2011
through 2016, the tax professionals will arrange a payment plan with the IRS.6
