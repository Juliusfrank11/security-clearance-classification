clearance.
In January 2016, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA),2 and
in section 22 (Police Record), he disclosed a May 2013 arrest for driving while intoxicated
(DWI). However, he did not disclose any previous involvement with, or use of illegal drugs
in section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity). In his July 2017 clearance interview,
he volunteered his repeated use of various illegal drugs, to the investigator.3 Applicant
stated  that  he  had  extensive  use  of  various  illegal  controlled  substances  including
cocaine,  mushrooms,  ecstasy,  marijuana,  Ritalin,  Vicodin,  and  various  pain  pills.  He
started  using  cocaine  as  a  senior  in  high  school  in  1998,  and  he  continued  to  use  it
recreationally about once every six months, until 2002.
In  2002,  Applicant  moved  in  with  his  girlfriend  and  his  drug  use  intensified.
Together, they used a panoply of illegal drugs every weekend for three years, until they
broke up in 2005. Then, Applicant’s illegal drug use slowed down again to once every six
months or so.4 He stated that he last used marijuana two years ago, and he last used un-
prescribed pain killers in 2005. Applicant never purchased or sold illegal drugs. They were
usually provided to him by friends in social settings. He stated he last used cocaine in
April 2017. He estimated he has driven under the influence of cocaine 12 to 16 times.
Applicant  initially  stated  that  he  did not  intend  to discontinue his  recreational  drug  use

Kuwait, where they are unavailable.
In  his  June  2018  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations
including his illegal use of various drugs (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.f) and testing positive on a drug
test administered by his employer in May 2015. (SOR ¶ 1.g) He clarified his admission to
the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.h since he has started a new job in the oil fields that requires
random  drug  testing  and  he  quit  using  recreational  drugs.  In  SOR  ¶  2.a,  Applicant
admitted to falsifying his responses in section 23 of his SCA, and termination from his
employment after testing positive on the May 2015 random drug test (SOR ¶ 2.b) He also
admitted to three DWI arrests in 2000, 2006, and 2013 (SOR ¶¶ 2.c – 2.e). The 2000
case was dismissed, and the 2006 DWI was reduced to a lesser offense.
Applicant was evaluated for alcohol and other substance use/abuse on October
18,  2018.  The  evaluating  doctor  found  no  evidence  of  any  Diagnostic  and  Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM 5) alcohol or substance use disorder. He did not find
that  Applicant  manifests  features  of  either  addiction or  dependence. Applicant  told  the
evaluator  that  he  last  used  cocaine  in  February  2017.  (AE  A)    Applicant  provided  no
evidence of character references or performance evaluations from his employer. He did
provide a statement of his unequivocal intent to not use illegal drugs after being granted
a security clearance and agreeing to automatic revocation of his security clearance if he
does.  (attachment  D  to  Answer)  He  also  provided  time  card  and  earnings  documents
reflecting that he earned approximately $21 per hour, and $31.50 per hour for overtime,
in 2018. He routinely worked six or seven days a week on 12 hour shifts.
