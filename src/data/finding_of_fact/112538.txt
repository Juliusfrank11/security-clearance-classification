Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  21  delinquent  accounts
totaling $19,102, is indebted to the Federal Government for a 2011 tax lien of $1,570 and
for a 2010 tax lien of $15,331, and that she failed to timely file her Federal tax returns for
2010, 2011, and 2016. The total alleged delinquent debt is $36,003. Applicant admits 12
of the SOR debts totaling $19,777, and to failing to timely file her tax returns. She denies
all  other  allegations.  The  delinquent  debts  are  reflected  in  Applicant’s  credit  bureau
reports (CBR) from April 2018 and March 2017, and discussed on her e-QIP, and in her
responses to Interrogatories, which include the summary of her personal subject interview
(PSI). (GX 6; GX 7; GX 4; GX 5.) Applicant’s admissions are incorporated in my findings
of fact.
Applicant is a 42-year-old curriculum director currently working a civilian supporting
a branch of the U.S. military. From 2014 until 2016, she was employed as a civilian for
another branch of the U.S. military. She was granted her first security clearance at some
point  during  that  employment.  She  completed  her  bachelor’s  degree  in  2007,  and
university-level certification in 2009. She married in 2006 and divorced in 2010. She has
one adult daughter. (GX 4.)
In her Answer, Applicant states, without specificity, that she began having financial
difficulties in 1999. However, Applicant identifies 2007 as a year that her ongoing financial
problems arose. Applicant graduated from college, and was employed by a state agency
as  a  social  worker.  Applicant  was  passionate  about  her  work,  but  due  to  her
compensation,  she  classifies  the  job  as  underemployment.  That  same  year,  Applicant
unexpectedly  gained  custody  of  her  friend’s  daughter,  then  11  years  old.  Becoming  a
sudden  parent  of  a  young  girl  who  was  then  experiencing  emotional  upheaval  had  a
significant impact on Applicant’s personal life. It also necessarily created additional strains
on  Applicant’s  already-stretched  finances,  including  counseling-related  costs  and
unanticipated medical costs. Applicant and her husband divorced in 2010, and Applicant
has remained a single parent. (GX 3.)
From 2007 forward, Applicant struggled financially, with some periods being more
difficult  than  others.  Applicant  also  stated  that  that  she  has  not  always  made  the  best
financial decisions. (Response; GX 3.) In 2016, she was also personally and financially
overwhelmed by having to care for her father during his terminal illness, which resulted in
many hours of long-distance commuting and the associated costs, as well as causing her
to leave graduate school before completing her coursework. (GX 3; GX 6.)
As a result of the onset of her financial difficulties, in 2007, Applicant was unable
to timely pay her 2006 tax-year obligation. During her PSI in April 2017, Applicant stated
that she owed the IRS approximately $8,000, was repaying the debt annually by having
her tax refund withheld and applied to her tax debts, and did not know when she would
satisfy the debt. She further stated that although she owed an outstanding balance, she
had regularly filed her tax returns. (GX 5.)
Applicant provided a copy of a letter to the IRS from May 2017 in which she stated
her intention to resolve any outstanding taxes, and requested information about the IRS’s
liens.  However,  the  letter  does  not  contain  a  mailing  address,  nor  does  it  contain
Applicant’s Social Security number or other taxpayer identification information. In 2018,
Applicant  contacted  the  IRS and  requested an  installment agreement for  unpaid  taxes
from 2008, 2009, 2012, and 2014. The IRS responded by letter, stating that it could not
consider  an  installment  agreement  because  it  had  not  received  Applicant’s  return  for
2016. There is a handwritten notation by Applicant on the IRS’s letter stating that the tax
returns have been filed, but she did not provide any corroborating evidence. (GX 5.)
Applicant’s May 23, 2018, IRS transcripts for tax years 2009 through 2017 show
that Applicant owes $15,983 in past-due taxes, interest, and penalties for tax years 2008,
2009, 2012, and 2014. The transcripts state that Applicant has not filed a return for 2010
or 2016, and there is simply no record relating to 2011 in the transcript. The transcript
also  shows  that  Applicant  filed  her  2017  return  on  May  7,  2018,  and  indicates  that
Applicant had a $1,829 tax liability for 2017. (GX 5.) The 2010 $15,331 (SOR ¶ 1.m) and
the $1,570 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.n) tax liens do not appear on the transcript, but remain unpaid
as of April 2018. (GX 6.)
However,  Applicant  submitted pages  3  and 5  of a five-page  document from  the
IRS to her regarding her 2016 tax return. Specifically, page 3 states that Applicant owes
an additional $3,217 for her 2016 taxes. The document states that Applicant is required
to  pay  this  amount  by  August  6,  2018,  to  avoid  penalties  and  interest  charges.  The
document lists a failure-to-file penalty of $610 and shows that the IRS received the return
on September 15, 2017. (GX 3.) There is no evidence that Applicant paid the $3,217 of
past-due taxes.
In her Answer, Applicant does not deny the tax liens alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.m and
1.n, but does dispute owing the amounts alleged in the SOR. Applicant stated that she
received  a  letter  from  the  IRS  showing  a  different  balance  owed,  but  not  showing  the
liens. She further stated that she contacted the IRS requesting a current amount due on
the liens.
In May 2008, Applicant made a $10 payment each on the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶
1.a, 1.h, 1.l, and 1.k. In her Answer, Applicant stated that she had received repayment
options from the creditor for SOR ¶ 1.a in August 2018; that she was waiting to hear from
the creditor for SOR ¶ 1.b about repayment options; that she was trying to find the original
creditor for the collection accounts for SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i with the intent of entering into
repayment agreements; and that she was entering into a repayment agreement with the
creditors for SOR ¶¶ 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.o, and 1.r. There is no record evidence that Applicant
entered any repayment agreements with any of these SOR creditors. Applicant admits
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d and has not taken any action on these debts.
Applicant disputed the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.p, 1.q, 1.s through
1.w with the three major credit reporting agencies. Applicant was told by a credit advisor
to dispute the delinquent accounts in order to ascertain if the accounts were Applicant’s
and were accurately reported. (Response.) However, there is no record evidence that any
of these debts were successfully disputed or removed from her credit reports.
Applicant  has  created  and  maintains  a  budget  worksheet,  and  uses  a  credit-
monitoring application on her cell phone. Her credit score has recently improved by 22
points. (GX 3.) Applicant’s April 2018 CBR shows no recently delinquent accounts. (GX
6.)  Applicant  is  active  in  her  community,  is  a  gubernatorial  appointee,  and  has  been
officially  recognized  for  her advocacy for  the  underserved. She  is dedicated  to  her  job
and to supporting the United States. Her daughter has recently earned a master’s degree.
