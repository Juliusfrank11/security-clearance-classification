Applicant, age 39, is single and has no children. He obtained his undergraduate
degree in 2005, and his master’s degree in 2017. He served in the United States Army
Reserve  from 1997  until  2005.   Applicant  completed  his  security  clearance  application
(SCA) on October 3, 2014. (GE 1)  He has worked for his current employer since May
2018. He also owns and operates an IT company, which began in 2017. He has held a
security clearance since 1997. (GE.1)
The SOR alleges in 1.a through 1.c, that Applicant failed to timely file, as required,
his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016; that he
failed to timely file, as required, state income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2012, 2013,
and 2015; and finally that he failed to timely pay, as required, his state income tax returns
for  tax  years  2011,  2012,  2013,  and  2015.  Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  but
explained that his failure to file or pay was due to a long-term overseas deployment in a
combat zone.
Applicant  attributed  his  tax  problem  to  extraordinary  circumstances.  (Tr.16)  He
worked as a project manager for a contracting company abroad in conflict areas and war
zones  from  November  2008  until  May  2016.    He  submitted  letters  of  authorization  to
confirm his claim. (Documents with Answer)  His trips home throughout the term of his
employment were brief and infrequent. He was home about twice a year for about a week.
While Applicant worked for the same defense company from 2008 until 2016, he was on
the move to various conflict zones. (Tr. 61) However, in tax year 2016, Applicant was a
part-time independent contractor abroad earning about $10,000, so he did not initially file
a tax return. (Tr. 30) He relied on the applicable tax code section and submitted a copy.
(Tab D) Applicant returned to the United States permanently at the end of 2016. (Tr. 68)
In Applicant’s 2014 SCA he disclosed his difficulty in filing tax returns due to the
time  it  took  to  collect  all  necessary  documents.  Applicant  explained  that  he  self-filed
Federal tax returns for tax years 2011 and 2012 and paid the tax due in September 2013.
(Tr. 80) In 2013 he attempted to work with a tax preparer, but they stated the issue was
too complex for them. (Tr. 32) In 2014, he hired a CPA to resolve the issues of filing while
he was deployed. (Tr. 32) For tax year 2015, he filed for an extension, then filed and paid
taxes within a timely manner. (Tr. 19. GE 2) During his 2015 investigative interview, he
explained the tax situation. (GE 2)
As to SOR 1.a, Applicant submitted tax transcripts from the IRS that show he filed
his  Federal tax  returns  from  2011 to  2016  within  the  time allotted  for  someone  who  is
working in a combat zone. He presented tax transcripts that show the date filed and the
amount of tax he paid. He owes not tax for that period.  (AE, Tab D) He has filed his 2016
and 2017 Federal tax returns.
As to SOR 1.b, and 1.c, Applicant stated that there was confusion as to which state
he  owed  taxes,  and  which  state  was  his  official  residence  while  abroad.  (Tr.  81)  He
believed  because  he  had  a  driver’s  license  from  state  A  and  had  lived  there  prior  to
deployment that it was his state of residence. His parents live in state B. State B contacted
his parents via telephone. (Tr. 81) He did not have a license in state B and did not believe
it was his state of residence. He left state A and gave his mailing address as his parent’s
residence.  (Tr. 96) Applicant learned about the state B tax issue and turned things over
to a tax person. Although no one was certain that he really owed state B, he filed and paid
all taxes for the years in question. (GE 3) Applicant stated that he and his tax agent are
working with the state treasury to resolve, if indeed, Applicant owed tax to state  B. He
now believes he may owe state taxes to state A, but they are trying to resolve any issue.
Applicant also believed after three years of living overseas, he gave up residence to state
A. (Tr. 120) It is in the record that  Department Counsel agreed to the confusion about
owing taxes to state B. (Tr. 128)
Applicant  submitted  various  awards  that  he  received  while  overseas  and
certificates of appreciation. (Tab B). The vast majority of his professional career has been
working for DoD. It reflects an extraordinary career.
Applicant  submitted  seven  character  letters,  including  one  from  his  FSO,  an
enrolled tax agent, supervisor, colleagues and others who have known him for about 20
years and served with him on deployments abroad. (AE Binder, Tab A). Each letter attests
to  his outstanding  qualities  and  ability  to handle  classified  information.  One  supervisor
stated that Applicant has never violated security rules or regulations. (Tr. 48)
