After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 30-year-old high school graduate with an electrical certificate received
from a technical school in May 2012 and an emergency medical technician license earned
in 2015. (GE 1; Tr. 30.) He was married from May 2009 to January 2013. (Tr. 31-32.) He
has a nine-year-old son and a six-year-daughter for whom he is obligated to pay child
support to his ex-wife. His child support is approximately $261 a month. (GEs 1-3.) As of
November  2018,  Applicant  and  his  cohabitant  fiancée  were  living  with  his  parents.
Applicant’s fiancée receives Social Security disability income (SSDI), and she has never
been employed. (Tr. 28, 32-33.)
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  June  2006.  More  than  a  decade  ago,
Applicant worked at a commissary on a military installation. (AE A.) It is unclear whether he
held any other employment before matriculating at a community college in August 2007.
After withdrawing from the college in October 2007, Applicant worked odd jobs “under the
table”  for  his uncle.  From  February  2011  to  May  2012,  Applicant  attended  a  technical
institute to obtain his certificate to work as an electrician. (GEs 1, 4.) Applicant paid for his
technical training in part with federal student loans. He obtained loans of $5,378 (SOR ¶
1.a) and $3,500 (SOR ¶ 1.b) in March 2011, and of $1,125 in March 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.c).
(GEs 2-3.) While in school, Applicant worked for a local electric company “under the table”
during the summer of 2011. (GE 4; Tr. 34.)
In January 2013, Applicant and his ex-wife divorced, and he was ordered to pay
child support. (GEs 1, 3.) According to Applicant, his child-support obligation was “pro-rated
for [his] earning potential at $350 a week, based on a job [he] didn’t have.” (Tr. 27.) There
is no evidence that he held any employment other than working for his uncle. After two to
three months of litigation, his child-support obligation was lowered to $150 a week. (Tr. 27.)
Applicant was employed by a solar-installation company from April 2015 to July
2015,  when  he  was  fired.  Applicant  told  an  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)
investigator in January 2018 that he was fired for operating a vehicle aggressively in the
company’s  parking  lot.  He  accidentally  accelerated  quickly.  (GE  4.)  At  his  hearing,
Applicant testified somewhat discrepantly that the company had a two-strike system. His
first strike occurred when a 19-year-old informally under his charge drove through the back
of the main panel and hit the bus barn. The second strike was that Applicant “dumped the
clutch” by accident on a company vehicle. (Tr. 34-35.)
In  December  2015,  Applicant  started working for a local electrical business.  He
indicates that he missed work when his son was hospitalized for a brain tumor, and was
terminated for attendance issues in April 2016. (GE 4; Tr. 35.)
In  August  2016,  Applicant  was  placed  by  a  temporary  agency  as  a  chemical
compounder for a pharmaceutical company. He moved from his parents’ home into an
apartment  with  his  fiancée.  After  not  reporting  to  work  for  three  days  due  to  illness  in
November  2016,  Applicant  was  terminated  by  the  temporary  agency,  even  though  he
maintains that he left a voice message that he was unable to report due to illness.1 (GE 4;
Tr. 36.) He and his fiancée lived off her disability income, his unemployment compensation,
and some financial assistance from his parents, but it was not enough to meet all of his
financial obligations while he was unemployed. He fell behind on his child support (SOR ¶
1.d),  and  he  and  his  fiancée  were  evicted  from  their  apartment  in  late  June  2017  for
nonpayment of rent.2 (GE 4.) In August 2017, Applicant’s former landlord placed a $5,807
debt for back rent and damages to the apartment for collection (SOR ¶ 1.e). Applicant and
his fiancée vacated the apartment owing $744 in utility charges for which Applicant was
legally liable for repayment. The debt was placed for collection in August 2018 (not alleged
in SOR). (GEs 2-3.)
1 Applicant told the OPM investigator in January 2018 that he had the flu. (GE 4.) He testified discrepantly that
he lost his job because he had to drive his ill mother for medical treatments every other day. (Tr. 33.)
2  Applicant  testified  that  his  monthly  rent  was  $791,  but he was charged an extra $300 a month for late
payment of his rent. (Tr. 49.)
Applicant and his fiancée moved  in with his parents in their home in July 2017.
Since then, he has primarily worked for his father, who owns a barbecue company, in lieu
of having to pay rent. Applicant has also worked for his uncle, who is a carpenter. Applicant
has  done  odd  jobs for neighbors. (AE A; Tr. 29, 38.) Applicant worked in a temporary
assignment at a sheet-metal factory from June 2017 to November 2017. (Tr. 37.)
In November 2017, Applicant was offered a position as an outside electrician at
$18.65  per  hour  with  a  defense  contractor,  contingent  on  him  obtaining  a  security
clearance.  (Tr.  31.)  On  November  20,  2017,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the
accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86).  In response to an
inquiry  concerning  any  delinquency  involving  enforcement  in  the  last  seven  years,
Applicant disclosed that he was $800 behind in his child-support payments, but that his
fiancée has been paying his child support for him “on the first of the month.” Applicant
responded negatively to inquiries concerning any delinquency on routine accounts. (GE 1.)
A  check  of  Applicant’s  credit  on  December  12,  2017,  revealed  that  his  federal
students loans were in collection for $8,140 (SOR ¶ 1.a), $4,352 (SOR ¶ 1.b), and $1,331
(SOR ¶ 1.c). Applicant was 120 days or more past due on his child support in the amount
of  $1,891  (SOR  ¶  1.d).  Applicant  also  owed  collection  debts  of  $5,807  to  his  former
landlord (SOR ¶ 1.e), $189 for medical services from October 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.f), and $67
for wireless-telephone services from December 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.g). (GE 2.)
On January 22, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the OPM. Applicant related that he and his fiancée were evicted from their apartment in
June 2017 for nonpayment of rent. He estimated that he owed his former landlord one
month’s rent of $791 and damage/utility charges of approximately $2,000. He indicated
that he had not received a bill, but he planned to pay the debt once he started working for
the defense contractor in approximately March 2018. Applicant volunteered that his child-
support arrearage had increased to $1,000 because of his unemployment, but he also
indicated  that  his  cohabitant  fiancée  has  been  making  payments  for  him.  He  also
volunteered that he owes an excise-tax debt from 2013 for a vehicle that was totaled in an
accident, although the record does not reflect the amount of the debt. He indicated that he
owes $1,200 on a delinquent credit-card account that he opened in 2006 (not alleged in
SOR). He had taken a $900 cash advance for living expenses that he then failed to repay.
Applicant admitted that he was still receiving demands for payment from the creditor. When
confronted with the adverse credit entries on his credit record, Applicant expressed his
belief  that  the  $189  collection  debt  was  an  outstanding  cable-television  debt  from  his
former apartment that he thought was his fiancée’s responsibility. About the federal student
loans, Applicant stated that his parents obtained the loans and have been repaying them.
He  denied  knowing  that  his  name  was  on  the  loans,  but  also  indicated  that  he  would
discuss them with his mother. Applicant expressed an intention to begin to repay his debts
when  he  starts  his  employment  with  the  defense  contractor.  The  investigator  gave
Applicant an opportunity to provide documentation about the debts on his credit record. He
provided no documents. (GE 4.)
As of November 5, 2018, Equifax was showing no progress toward resolving his
federal student loans, which had accrued to $8,499 (SOR ¶ 1.a), $4,486 (SOR ¶ 1.b), and
$1,362 (SOR ¶ 1.c). Likewise, Applicant had not made any payments toward the $5,807
collection debt owed his former landlord (SOR ¶ 1.e) or a $744 utility bill in collection from
that apartment (not alleged in SOR). His child-support arrearage was $3,619 (SOR ¶ 1.d).
When asked to explain the arrearage, given he had told the OPM investigator that his
fiancée was making his child support payments, Applicant responded that “she was at one
point.” (Tr. 42.) Applicant made a child-support payment of $200 in September 2018. (GE
3; Tr. 43.) He testified that his child-support obligation is currently $50 a week (Tr. 27),
while his credit report reflects a scheduled amount of $261 monthly. (GE 3.) The $189 and
$67 collection debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g) were no longer on his credit record, but there is
no evidence that they have been paid.
Applicant testified that he has paid as many of his bills as he is able based on his
limited  income.  He  has  been  helping  to  care  for  his  ill  mother  and  grandmother  and
indicates  that  he  has  not  had  the  time  or money  to pay off his debts.  (Tr. 20, 30.) He
worked on and off for electrical companies, as he was laid off when the job for which he
was hired ended. (Tr. 39.) When he was employed, his take-home pay was approximately
$350 a week from which he paid child support at $78 weekly, which included $28 toward
the  arrearage.  He  testified  that  he  incurred  some  $35,000  in  legal  fees  to  obtain  joint
custody of his children. He averred that he paid a $10,000 retainer fee upfront in 2012 and
then $300 a month toward the $25,000 balance. (Tr. 22-23, 26.) Applicant later explained
that he and his mother obtained a loan against her credit and paid off his attorney. (Tr. 48.)
Applicant testified about his federal student loans that he was granted four hardship
deferments that were each valid for two years. However, he then claimed that when he last
obtained a deferment four years ago, he was told that it was good for four years. (Tr. 23-
24.) His November 2018 credit report shows that his student loans have been seriously
delinquent since September 2016 (GE 3), which calls into question his deferment claim
about the length of the latest deferment. He testified that he spent hours on the phone
trying to determine if he can get another deferment and that he has had no success in
ascertaining to whom he is supposed to make his student-loan payments. He understands
his student loans are in collection status. (Tr. 40.) He also indicated that he and his parents
have  tried  unsuccessfully  to  obtain  a  consolidation  loan  to  address  his  student  loans.
Applicant was granted three weeks after his hearing to submit documentation of any or all
of his claimed deferments. He presented no documentation, even though he stated that he
had emails about the deferments and documentation showing that he had applied for a
consolidation loan. (Tr. 24, 40-42.)
Applicant’s cohabitant fiancée receives disability income of $791 monthly. Applicant
intends  to  claim  her  as  a  dependent  on  his  income  tax  returns  for  tax  year  2018.  He
expects that he overpaid his income taxes and that his refund will be seized by the state
and applied to his child-support arrearage. (Tr. 28.)
Applicant testified that he attempted to arrange for repayment of his $5,807 debt to
his former landlord, but he was told to deal with the collection entity. (Tr. 43-44.) Applicant
asserts  that  he  would  have  repaired  the  little  holes  in  the  walls  from  his  children  and
cleaned the dirty carpets, but he was evicted and so did not have the opportunity to fix the
damages  to  the  apartment.  (Tr.  44.)  Applicant  asserts  that  the  $67  cell-phone  debt  in
collection  was  supposed  to  have  been  paid  by  his  ex-wife  on  their  divorce.  He
acknowledged that the account was in his name, however. (Tr. 45.) He disputes the validity
of  the  $189  medical  debt  in  collection  because  his  children  had  medical  insurance
coverage from the state. (Tr. 45.) As for the utility debt in collection for $744, Applicant
testified that he was charged for power for six months after his eviction. (Tr. 48.)
Applicant  had  no  funds  in  checking  or  savings  accounts  as  of  his  hearing  in
November 2018. He was working directly for his parents. His parents require him to work
12 hours a month in exchange for paying rent of $300. Any work beyond those hours pays
for his food, gasoline, and other expenses. (Tr. 45-46.) Applicant has applied for public
assistance but been denied because he lives with his parents, and his father’s earnings
disqualify him. (Tr. 47.)
A longtime friend of Applicant’s provided a character reference letter for him. They
met  16  years  ago,  and  they  were  once  co-workers  at  the  commissary  on  a  military
installation. They see each other frequently. She described Applicant as “an incredibly
focused  and  driven  individual.”  She  knows  him  to  be  “a  very  reliable,  trustworthy  and
dependable person.” Applicant has kept a positive attitude despite struggling to find full-
time, gainful employment. He has been a devoted father to his two children. (AE A.)
