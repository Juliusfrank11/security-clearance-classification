In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d through 1.i, and
1.r. He denied SOR ¶¶ 1.c, and 1.j through 1.q.  At the hearing, Applicant stated that his
previous admission to SOR ¶ 1.i was a mistake, and denied owing this debt. (Tr. 25)
Applicant is 40 years old. He earned an associate’s degree in 1998. He married in
2000 and divorced in 2001. He considered himself to be in a common-law marriage from
2003 to at least 2017. He legally married his common law spouse in 2018. He has three
children,  ages  4,  9,  and  12.  He  is  employed  with  a  Federal  contractor  as  a  fire  pump
technician since October 2016. He does not currently possess a DOD security clearance.
(Tr. 8-9; GE 1, GE 2)
Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file state and Federal income tax
returns for 2013, 2014, and 2015.1 He owes seven state tax liens totaling approximately
$14,323. He is also indebted for a deficiency balance from his mortgage, a delinquent
student loan, a repossessed car deficiency balance, and various other forms of consumer
debt. These debts total approximately $55,000. Applicant attributed his financial problems
to a failed business he opened in March 2013 and closed in September 2013.2 He was
then underemployed in 2013-2014, which provided a minimal amount of income. (Tr. 23)
The  record  established  the  status  of  Applicant’s  unpaid  accounts  and  untimely
filed tax returns as follows:
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and 1.b  allege  Applicant failed  to file  state and  Federal  income  tax
returns for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015. He has not filed these tax returns because
1 Department Counsel asked to amend SOR ¶ 1.a to include tax year 2013, to conform to the testimony
and evidence presented at the hearing, which I granted without objection.
2 There is a discrepancy in dates when comparing the SCA with the dates provided in Applicant’s testimony
at the hearing. I used the dates of self-employment listed on the 2017 SCA. (GE 1)
he  claimed  his  previous  employer  has  not  provided  him  with  the  necessary  tax
documentation.  At  the  hearing,  he  admitted  that  he  has  not  contacted  the  Internal
Revenue Service or state tax agency to discuss these tax issues. On February 26, 2019,
Applicant  submitted  two  documents  showing  that  he  was  continuing  to  have  taxes
assessed against him by the state for his business that closed in 2013. He also provided
an agreement with a company he hired to help him resolve his state tax issue and assist
him in filing his 2013-2015 state and Federal income tax returns. (Tr. 15-19, 33; AE C,
AE D)
SOR ¶ 1.c3 (SOR ¶ 1.p) alleges a mortgage deficiency in the amount of $12,668,
after  Applicant’s  residence  was  sold  via  short  sale  in  2015.  Applicant  claimed  that  he
could not recall if he received a 1099-C from the mortgage creditor to reflect the deficiency
amount as income for his unfiled 2015 income tax return. Applicant admitted that he had
not contacted this creditor to resolve this financial issue. (Tr. 29-33)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges a deficiency balance of $14,157, the amount due after a car
was repossessed for failure to make timely payments. Applicant purchased a new car in
late  2012,  but  it  was  repossessed  approximately  one  year  later.  This  account  has  not
been resolved, and he has not contacted this creditor. (Tr. 22, 24)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a delinquent account in the amount of $9,902, which Applicant
used to purchase tools for his business he opened in 2013. At the time of his hearing,
Applicant had not taken any action to resolve this debt. (Tr. 23-25)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges an unpaid utility account in the amount of $788. Applicant moved
from state A to state B, and did not realize that he had an outstanding utility bill. He has
not made any payments on this account, but stated he hopes to pay this account in full in
the  near  future.  As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  he  had  not  made  any  contact  with  the
creditor. (Tr. 24-25)
In January 2019, Applicant paid the two outstanding medical bills alleged in SOR
¶¶ 1.g and 1.h, in the combined amount of $130. These debts are resolved. (Tr. 25; AE
A, AE B)
SOR ¶¶ 1.i -1.o allege seven state tax liens filed in the total amount of $14,323.
Applicant claimed the state tax liens were related to his 2013 self-employment. During
the time he operated his business, he did not file or report quarterly earnings to the state.
The state then filed the maximum amount of taxes for each quarter. The seven tax liens
are for seven quarters, and include taxes assessed against Applicant long after he closed
the business in September 2013. Applicant admitted that he failed to notify the state when
he closed his business. In about August 2018, Applicant filed a form through the state
website providing notice that he had closed his business in September 2013. He admitted
that he had not called the state tax agency directly to discuss the seven tax liens filed
against him. On February 26, 2019, Applicant provided a document showing that the state
3 Note SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.c and 1.p are duplicate allegations with the same creditor, which is actually a
mortgage creditor and not a student loan creditor, as mistakenly alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. (Tr. 29-31)
continued  to  assess  taxes  against  him  in  at  least  2017.  He  also  submitted  a  signed
agreement dated February 2019 with a tax resolution company to provide assistance with
his current tax issues. (Tr. 25-29; AE C, AE D)
SOR ¶ 1.q alleges a delinquent student loan in the amount of $16,577. Applicant
stated that he has only had one student loan account, and his tax refunds for tax years
2016 and 2017 were intercepted to pay this outstanding debt. He claimed that the balance
of his unpaid student loan is approximately $11,439. He failed to provide documentation
with his SOR response and at the hearing. On February 27, 2019, Applicant stated that
he had called the student loan servicer and claimed his current outstanding student loan
balance was $11,276. He asked that his 2018 tax refund be voluntarily intercepted to pay
this account. Applicant failed to provide any supporting documentation with his e-mail to
show the current student loan balance, or whether this account has been fully resolved.
(Tr. 34-35, e-mail dated February 27, 2019.)
SOR ¶ 1.r alleges a $750 debt owed to a bank. Applicant claimed this amount was
for a safety deposit box he had closed with the bank, but he did not provide the bank with
the safety deposit box key, as required. He admitted at the hearing that this debt had not
been paid and he had not yet made contact with the bank to resolve this account. (Tr. 36-
37)
On the January 2017 SCA, Applicant listed that he had not filed his tax returns for
2013,  2014,  and  2015.  He  listed  that  he  disputed  the  state  taxes  for  2013,  and  was
seeking the help of a tax attorney. For tax years 2014 and 2015, he listed that he had not
filed his tax returns due to negligence. He was currently working with a tax preparation
company  to  resolve  his  tax  issues.  During  his  background  interview  in  October  2017,
Applicant admitted that he had not filed his state and Federal income tax returns for 2013,
2014, and 2015, but it was his intention to file these tax returns. During his January 2019
hearing, he had not filed these state and Federal tax returns.
