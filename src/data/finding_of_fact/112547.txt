Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through 1.f, and 1.l through 1.v,
and denied the allegations in ¶¶ 1.g.through 1.k. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 48 years old. She earned an associate’s degree in 1998. She married
in 1988 and divorced in 1997. She remarried in 1998. She has children ages 23 and 19
years old. Both children live at home. She has been employed by a federal contractor
since July 2017. She was laid off from a prior position in April 2017. She was unemployed
for a month, accepted a job in May 2017, and then resigned and accepted her current
position.  She  had  to  relocate  to  another  state.  She  testified  that  she  did  not  receive  a
paycheck  for  three  months,  and  her  husband  was  unemployed  when  they  moved.
Applicant testified that her salary was $90,000 in 2014, and it has incrementally increased
to her current salary of $110,000, and her husband’s current salary is $50,000.2
The SOR debts are corroborated by Applicant’s admissions, testimony, and credit
reports from August 2017 and April 2018.3
Applicant testified that she has had financial difficulties in the past. Her husband
had inconsistent employment and periods of unemployment. She said that since 2011,
she has been more financially stable because her husband has been working. She said
that  prior  to  2011,  she  was  not  earning  as  much  money  and  was  only  paying  for
necessities.4
Applicant testified that she timely filed her state income tax returns from 2003 to
2012, but did not pay the taxes because she did not have enough money.5 She said she
believed  she  paid  one  year,  but  could  not  recall  which  year.  She  did  not  make
arrangements at the time with the state taxing authority to pay her state income taxes.

5 Applicant testified that she timely filed her federal income tax returns. There are no allegations concerning
her federal income tax returns. I have not considered any derogatory evidence that was not alleged in the
SOR for disqualifying purposes. I considered it when making a credibility determination, in the application
of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis.
She said she attempted to adjust her withholdings, but it did not make a difference. She
said  in  2011,  she  attempted  to  make  a  payment  arrangement  and  contacted  an
accountant to recalculate her taxes. She said the state tax authority advised her that upon
paying the delinquent taxes, it would forgive the penalties. State tax liens are alleged in
SOR ¶¶ 1.g ($4,484-entered April 2014); 1.h ($528-entered January 2014); 1.i ($5,518-
entered  January  2014);  1.j  ($5,163-entered  January  2013);  and  1.k  ($2,969-entered
November 2012).6
In February 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. She
disclosed  that  in  2014  she  was  notified  by  the  state  taxing  authority  that  she  owed  a
significant amount of taxes dating back to 2004. She did not agree with the amount owed
and had her accountant recalculate it. She told the investigator that she made an offer to
pay $800 a month to the state, but it was denied. She said she sent emails, letters, and
faxes to the taxing authority, but did not receive responses. She said she managed to get
the penalties waived. She continued to dispute the amount she owed. She said she would
continue to actively try to resolve the tax debt. She provided a letter from the state taxing
authority from June 2015, which stated: “Penalties will be waived upon payment of tax
and interest.”7
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she provided correspondence between her and
the state taxing authority. She made a request in May 2018 for a waiver of penalties for
tax years 2008 and 2009. She listed that her total tax liability for those years as $11,092.
The request did not offer a settlement amount or monthly payment. Applicant testified that
she is still negotiating a payment arrangement with the taxing authority. She rejected an
offer to make 12 monthly payments of $1,000 to settle the tax liens because she was not
in a position to pay that amount, so she is still in negotiations. She testified that she could
not  afford  to  make  payments  immediately  because  she  has  prioritized  her  daughter’s
schooling  over  paying  her  taxes.  After  her  hearing,  she  provided  an  email  dated
November 26, 2018, to the state taxing authority for an offer in compromise to pay $1,000
for 12 months beginning on January 15, 2019. No additional emails or correspondence
was provided to confirm the agreement was accepted.8
Applicant admitted that the other debts alleged in the SOR were from 2005 to 2015.
She  had  medical  insurance  and  many  of  the  delinquent  accounts  alleged  are  unpaid
copayments. She said she did not have the money to pay the medical debts. She did not
make payment arrangements when these bills were owed. The charged-off debt in SOR
¶ 1.a ($6,422) is a personal loan Applicant obtained in 2014. She testified that she made
payments until she moved in April 2017. She stopped making payments and defaulted on
the loan. She testified she attempted to make a payment, but it was returned. Applicant
testified that the charged-off debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($1.693) was a joint account she had with
her father,  who  passed  away  in  2015.  It  was for a  line of  credit. She  testified that  she

stopped paying the debt in July 2017. In May 2018, Applicant initiated a payment plan to
make monthly payments of $379 for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($6,422), 1.b ($4,324), 1.c
($2,459), 1.d ($1,864), 1.e ($1,693), and 1.f ($772). She testified that she began making
payments  in  June  2018.  She  provided  proof  of  the  agreement  and  an  August  2018
payment.9
Applicant  disputed  many  of  the  debts  in  her  credit  report.  Many  of  the  medical
debts were deleted. She did not provide detailed information as to which debts alleged
on the SOR were deleted. I have given her the benefit of the doubt and conclude those
remaining medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.m through 1.v were deleted.10
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.l is owed to a college where Applicant enrolled for a course.
She did not complete the course and agrees she owes the debt, but has not paid it.11
Applicant testified that she did not have a budget. In her post-hearing documents,
she provided a budget worksheet that included her payment plan and an amount allotted
to pay her state tax liens. She has not taken credit counseling. She testified that she lives
paycheck  to  paycheck.  She  had  a  friend,  who  is  an  accountant,  review  her  spending
habits  and  found  that  she  spends  $2,000  a  month  on  food  and  that  she  goes  to
restaurants four times a week. She has $900 in savings and no investments, other than
a 401k pension with $3,000-$4,000 in it. She admitted that she has been neglectful with
her finances, which were overwhelming.12
