Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.h, 2.a through 2.o,
2.q through 2.t, and 3.a, with explanations. She denied SOR ¶¶ 2.p, and 3.b through 3.e.
(Item 1.)
Applicant is 42 years old. She earned an associate’s degree in 1997. She listed on
her April 2016 electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) that she
has been employed in her present position since May 2001. She occupies a position of
trust. She was married to her first husband from June 1996 to February 2009. She married
her second husband in 2010, and has three children and one stepchild. (Item 2; Item 3;
Item 4.)
On  Applicant’s  April  2016  e-QIP,  she  indicated:  “I  experimented  with  several
different drugs in high school, but the only one that I continued to do beyond high school
was marijuana and there were stretches of years (including my first marriage) when I did
not do it out of respect for those around me who do not smoke.” (Item 4.) She estimated
the dates of use to be June 1991 through April 2016. She further checked the box that
indicated  she  intended  to  engage  in this  activity  in  the  future  and  indicated  that  “while
there  are  no  specific  plans  of  continuing  [to  use  marijuana],  there  are  also  no  specific
plans of avoiding it, either.” (Item 4.)
During her subject interview conducted on May 23, 2017, Applicant discussed her
drug  use  in  detail.  (Item  5.)  She  indicated  that  she  used  and  purchased  marijuana  at
varying  frequencies  since 1991.  At the  time of  the  interview,  she  used  marijuana on a
weekly  basis.  She  used  marijuana  with  her  husband  and  friends.  She  disclosed  that
between 1991 and 1994 she used cocaine once, LSD three times, and amphetamines at
varying frequencies. (Item 5.)
Applicant  completed  Public  Trust  Position  Applications  in  July  2003  and  March
2005.  Questions 21(a)  and  21(b)  on  those forms asked  Applicant if  she  had used  any
controlled substance within the last year and whether in the past seven years she had
been involved in the illegal purchase of any narcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen,
or cannabis. She answered all of these questions no. She claimed in her answer to the
SOR that between March 1994 and May 2008, she did not use or purchase any controlled
substance to include marijuana. Her claim is credible, as she consistently indicated that
she did not use marijuana during the course of her first marriage, which corresponds with
the dates of her Public Trust Position Applications. (Items 2-5.)
Applicant  was  also  alleged  to  be  indebted  on  19  delinquent  accounts  totaling
$34,656, and to have discharged debt through Chapter 7 bankruptcy in June 2004. These
debts and the bankruptcy filing were established in the bankruptcy petition and the credit
reports dated May 6, 2005, June 9, 2016, and July 16, 2018. (Items 7-10.) She attributed
her debts to her divorce, the need for emergency medical care, and underemployment.
(Item 5.)
In Applicant’s Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, filed in March 2004, she listed assets
totaling  $16,053  and  liabilities  of  $64,500.  All  of  her  liabilities  were  unsecured  claims.
They were discharged in June 2004. (Item 10.)
Of her alleged delinquent debts, a total of $10,102 related to unresolved medical
accounts,  as  stated  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.d,  1.g  through  1.o,  1.q,  and  1.s.  In  her
answer, she indicated, “I admit  that  I have many medical bills and am actively making
payments every month to pay them off. I do not know which of these debts is legitimate
and/or still outstanding.” She provided nothing further in this regard. Her July 2018 credit
report listed four delinquent medical accounts, which correspond  with  SOR ¶¶ 1.k, 1.l,
1.m,  and  1.n.  It  is  unclear  if  the  other  medical  debts  alleged  were  resolved  through
payment or if they are no longer reported on the credit report due to their age. SOR ¶¶
1.a through 1.d, 1.g through 1.o, 1.q, and 1.s are unresolved. (Items 8, 9.)
Applicant also had four non-medical debts identified on the SOR. She was alleged
to be delinquent in the amount of $3,707 for a judgment against her by a bank, as stated
in SOR ¶ 1.e. She satisfied this judgment in January 2013, as reflected on her July 2016
credit  report.  She  was  also  alleged  to  be  indebted  on  a  judgment  obtained  by  a  utility
company in the amount of $658 as stated in  SOR ¶ 1.f. She satisfied this judgment in
February  2011,  as  reflected  on  her  July  2016  credit  report.  These  debts  are  resolved.
(Item 8.)
SOR  ¶  1.p  alleged Applicant  was  indebted  on  a  repossessed  automobile  in  the
amount of $16,873. This debt became delinquent in January 2010. Applicant denied this
debt. She indicated that this debt was incurred by her ex-husband without her knowledge
or permission. “As soon as [she] discovered the purchase had been made, [she] left him.
In  [their]  divorce  papers,  this  is  the  date  of  [their]  separation.”  Applicant  presented  no
evidence  establishing  that  she  contested  this  debt  with  the  creditor  or  credit  reporting
agency. This debt is unresolved. (Item 8.)
SOR ¶ 1.r alleged Applicant was indebted to a bank in the amount of $3,316. The
debt was reported as delinquent in October 2014. She admitted this debt and claimed to
have set up a payment agreement with this creditor. She provided no documentation of
that agreement or of any payments made to this creditor. This debt is unresolved. (Items
5, 8.)
