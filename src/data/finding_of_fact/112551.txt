Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance. He works as a military jet aircraft mechanic and crew chief. He is responsible
for  scheduled  maintenance,  unscheduled  maintenance,  pilot  safety,  and  security.  (Tr.
18) He has had this job with a company in the defense industry since January 2017. His
formal education includes a high school diploma, completion of military technical school,
and a  certificate as  a medical assistant awarded  in  July  2016.  Applicant’s  background
includes honorable service in the U.S. Air Force from November 2003 to about January
2015, for about 11 years in total. (Exhibit E) His primary specialty in the Air Force was
tactical aircraft maintenance. He obtained and held a security clearance while on active
duty.
Applicant  is  twice  married.  His  first  marriage  ended  in  divorce  in  June  2014,
when  he  was  serving  in  the  Air  Force.  (Exhibit W) The  couple  separated  in  2010.  (Tr.
19)  He  has  three  children  from  the  marriage,  ages  17,  14,  and  11.  Applicant  shares
custody  of  the  minor  children  with  his  former  spouse  as  follows:  one  week  with
Applicant,  two  weeks  with  the  mother,  then  alternating  throughout  the  year.  Applicant
and  the  mother  have  joint  legal  decision  making  concerning  the  children.  Applicant
married his current spouse in 2014. He has three adult stepchildren from the marriage,
none  of  whom  reside  in  his  household.  His  mother-in-law,  age  68,  lives  in  Applicant’s
household,  and  she  contributes  financially  as  she  is  able  (e.g.,  buying  grocery  items).
Applicant  paid  child  support during  the  separation.  The  court ordered  Applicant  to  pay
$586 monthly in child support and $600 monthly in spousal maintenance for 36 months.
(Exhibit W) The court-ordered amounts were based on Applicant’s then military pay and
benefits.
Applicant  has  had  inconsistent  employment  since  his  departure  from  military
service in January 2015. As a trained and experienced aircraft mechanic, he had a job
lined up to work in that field, but the job fell through a few weeks before his discharge.
(Tr. 61) As a result, he accepted a job as a forklift operator for $9 per hourl. (Tr. 21) He
had that job from February 2015 to September 2015. He next worked as a laborer until
December 2015. He was an unemployed full-time student from December 2015 to July
2016,  when  he  completed  the  medical  assistant  certificate.  He  worked  as  a  medical
assistant  from  July  2016  to  January  2017,  when  he  began  his  current  job  working  in
aircraft  maintenance.  He  now  earns  nearly  $33  per  hour,  and  he  estimated  his  gross
income  for  2018  at  about  $64,000.  (Tr.  65;  Exhibit  H)  His  spouse  is  a  manager  for  a
grocery store, and he estimated her gross income for 2018 at about $27,000.
Applicant  has  largely  admitted  the  delinquent  financial  accounts  alleged  in  the
SOR,  and  those  allegations  are  also  established  by  the  documentary  evidence.
(Exhibits 2-6) In particular, the SOR concerns seven delinquent accounts, in collection,
charged  off,  or  past  due.  The  most  serious  are  the  past-due  child  or  family  support
accounts  indebted  to  a  state  department  of  economic  security  in  amounts  of  $17,089
and $10,089. The remaining five delinquent accounts, in collection or charged off, range
in amounts from $246 to $4,564 for a total of about $9,546.
Applicant  attributed  his  history  of  financial  problems  to  loss  of  income  when  he
left military service in January 2015 and his inconsistent employment over the next two
years.  He  characterized  the  change  in  income  as  “drastic.”  (Tr.  20-21)  He  could  not
afford  his  child-support  and  spousal-maintenance  obligations  along  with  his  rent  and
monthly  living  expenses.  (Tr.  19-22)  As  a  result,  he  went  into  arrears  on  his  court-
ordered payments. He explained that he was always making payments, but not the full
amount, perhaps $200 or $300 monthly. The situation changed in about January 2017,
when he began his current employment in the defense industry.
Applicant is no longer required to pay $600 monthly in spousal maintenance, as
that  terminated  after  36  months  (June  2017).  Although  he  remains  in  arrears  for  both
accounts,  since  combined  into  one,  he  has  made  regular  payments  for  the  last  two
years (2017 and 2018). He is now paying $586 for child support and about $136 extra
for arrears; pay stubs from December 2017 and June 2018 show a deduction of about
$361, which totals $722 monthly. (Exhibit H)
The  current  balance  on  the  account  with  the  state  department  of  economic
security was $16,367, as of November 23, 2018. (Exhibit V) The balance was $17,484,
as  of  July  3,  2018,  which  consisted  of  a  child-support  arrearage  of  $3,064  and  a
spousal-maintenance arrearage of $14,209. (Exhibit K at 1) Records also establish that
from February 21, 2016, to July 5, 2018, he paid a total of $24,349, with $10,550 toward
arrears and $13,799 toward the current obligation. (Exhibit K) A payment of $7,937 was
made on March 7, 2016, which was an income-tax refund intercepted by the IRS. It was
applied toward arrears.
Turning next to the consumer debts, the $4,546 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.c
stems  from  an  apartment  lease  Applicant  co-signed  for  his  first  wife  when  they  were
married  but  separated.  (Tr. 23-27, 49-51)  He  was  unaware  of  this  debt until receipt  of
the  SOR;  he  did  not  recall  it  during  the  background  investigation.  (Exhibit  2)  His  then
wife was evicted from the apartment due to nonpayment of rent; the court ordered the
eviction in February 2013, although neither Applicant nor his wife were present in court;
the court entered a judgment in the sum of $2,385, plus a $230 late fee and $70 in court
costs.  (Exhibit  Q)  Applicant  entered  into  a  payment  arrangement  with  the  current
creditor  for  $50  monthly,  and  he  made  the  first  monthly  payment  on  December  12,
2018. (Exhibit U at 2)
The $2,864 charged-off account in SOR ¶ 1.d stems from an unsecured personal
loan Applicant obtained from a lender that serves the military community. (Tr. 27-31, 51-
54)  He  defaulted  on  the  loan  due  to  inability  to  pay,  making  his  last  payment  in
December 2014, which was after his divorce was final and shortly before his discharge.
(Tr.  54)  The  account  is  now  in  collection  with  a  law  firm;  the  current  balance  was
$5,882, as of November 30, 2018; and Applicant agreed to a payment arrangement of
$250  monthly.  (Exhibit  T)  He  made  the  first  monthly  payment  on  December  7,  2018.
(Exhibit U at 2)
The $101 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.e stems from an account with an electric
utility. Applicant paid this account in full in January 2018. (Exhibit L)
The  $1,771  collection account  in  SOR ¶  1.f stems from an  apartment  Applicant
had  leased.  (Tr.  31-32)  He  moved  out  of  the  apartment  thinking  the  security  deposit
would  cover  any  remaining  expenses.  The  account  was  reduced  to  judgment  in  the
amount of $1,403, plus interest, and then collected via a writ of garnishment beginning
in  May  2017.  (Exhibit  J)  The  judgment  was  satisfied  through  the  garnishment  as  of
February 2018. (Exhibit 6 at 1)
The  $246  collection  account  in  SOR  ¶  1.g  stems  from  a  telecommunications
account.  Applicant  settled  this  account  for  the  lesser  amount  of  about  $197  in  August
2017. (Exhibit I)
Applicant  recently  qualified  to  obtain  a  mortgage  loan  to  buy  a  home  for  about
$183,000.  (Tr.  35,  54-57;  Exhibit  6  at  1-2)  He  bought  the  home  in  October  2017,  and
then refinanced the loan to a lower interest rate with a different lender in May 2018. He
had  some difficulty  in qualifying  for the  loan,  but  was  able  to  do  so  once  he produced
paperwork showing  he  had  been  paying  child  support.  (Tr.  57) The  loan  is  a  $0  down
payment mortgage issued by a private lender, and guaranteed by the U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs. The most recent credit report from November 2018 shows that both
loans have been paid as agreed. (Exhibit 6 at 1-2)
In addition to the home purchase, Applicant obtained financial counseling from a
consumer  credit  counseling  organization  in  August  2018.  (Exhibit  N)  The  counseling
appears to have been comprehensive, as it resulted in a 31-page report for Applicant’s
review and use. Personal financial statements also establish that Applicant’s household
budget has a positive monthly net remainder. (Exhibits M and N)
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the  burden  of  proof  is  less  than  a  preponderance  of  evidence.3  The  DOHA  Appeal
Board  has  followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s findings  of  fact  are  reviewed
under the substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.6
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
1  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S.  518,  528  (1988)  (“it  should  be  obvious  that  no  one  has  a
‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no
right to a security clearance).
2 484 U.S. at 531.
3 484 U.S. at 531.
4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).
5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).
6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶¶ E3.1.14 and E3.1.15.
Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;
AG  ¶  20(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  a  death,  divorce,  or
separation,  clear  victimization  by  predatory  lending  practices,  or  identity
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.  The
disqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.
Turning  to  the  matters in  mitigation,  Applicant’s  financial  problems  are  due  to  a
combination  of  factors;  namely,  his  divorce  and  the  resulting  support  obligations,  his
decline in income upon leaving military service, and his inconsistent employment for the
two years prior to his current job. Those circumstances were largely beyond his control.
He  acted  reasonably  under  the  circumstances  by  taking  jobs  below  his  qualifications
and paying whatever he could afford. He made a major improvement to his situation by
obtaining  his  current  job,  which  has  good  pay  and  benefits.  Given  the  circumstances,
the mitigating condition at AG ¶ 20(b) applies in Applicant’s favor.
Applicant  has  initiated  a  good-faith  effort  to  resolve  his  indebtedness.  He
receives substantial credit for addressing the highest priority debt in the SOR, which is
his ongoing child-support obligation, and he is making progress on the arrears too. He
also  receives  credit  for  resolving  the  two  minor  collection  accounts  and  the  $1,771
collection  account.  The  latter  was  resolved  after  it  was  reduced  to  judgment  and
collected via garnishment, which is not considered voluntary or in good faith under AG ¶
20(d), although some people prefer the garnishment process because it works. He also
receives  credit  for  making  payment  arrangements  for  the  two  largest  consumer
accounts, the $4,564 collection account and the $2,864 charged-off account in SOR ¶¶
1.c and 1.d. His efforts in that regard were quite recent, which suggests he was slow to
act once he returned to better-paying employment in 2017. And there is no track record
of  payments  for  those  two  accounts,  and  so  it  is  premature  to  conclude  that  he  is
adhering to a good-faith effort to repay those particular debts. Given the circumstances,
the mitigating condition at AG ¶ 20(d) does not fully apply in Applicant’s favor, but he is
entitled to partial credit for the reasons discussed above.
Applicant did not present a perfect case in mitigation, but, as in all human affairs,
perfection  is  not  the  standard.  A  security  clearance  case  is  not  a  debt-collection
procedure.  It  is  a  procedure  designed  to  evaluate  an  applicant’s  judgment,  reliability,
and  trustworthiness.  See  ISCR  Case  No.  09-02160  (App.  Bd.  Jun.  21,  2010).  An
applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged
in  the  SOR.  An  applicant  need  only  establish  a  plan  to  resolve  the  financial  problems
and  take  significant  actions  to  implement  the  plan.  There  is  no  requirement  that  an
applicant  make  payments  on  all  the  delinquent  debts  simultaneously,  nor  is  there  a
requirement  that  the  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  be  paid  first.  See  ISCR  Case  No.  07-
06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).
Here, I am persuaded that Applicant is making an honest effort to be financially
responsible and repay his creditors. There are clear indications that he is repaying his
creditors,  and  his  financial  problems  appear  to  be  under  control.  So  long  as  he
continues in his present job, which has good pay and benefits, it is most probable that
he  will  continue  to  make  the  court-ordered  support  payments  and  adhere  to  the
payment  arrangements
for  the  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.d.  The  financial
considerations concern is mitigated.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent  standard,  I  have  no  doubts  about
Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or
sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence  as  a  whole
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or  vice
versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he met his ultimate
burden  of  persuasion  to  show  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to
grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:
For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.g:
For Applicant
Conclusion
It  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  interests  of  national  security  to  grant  Applicant
eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility granted.
