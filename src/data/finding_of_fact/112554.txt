Applicant is 37 years old. She obtained her associate’s degree in 2011 and her
bachelor’s degree in 2013. She has been employed as a human resources manager for
a federal contractor since July 2016.  Applicant was unemployed briefly from May 2016
to June 2016 when she was terminated for alleged theft from her employer by uttering a
forged instrument. Applicant reports no military service. She married in June 2001 and
divorced in June 2009. Applicant is a single mother of three children. Applicant has not
previously held a security clearance.
On May 25, 2017, Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SCA),
and in section 22 (Police Record) she disclosed her arrest in May 2016 when her previous
employer accused her of forgery and grand larceny alleging that she forged and cashed
phony payroll checks. She also disclosed that she was fired from this job. She stated that
the case was dismissed by the court in December 2016.2 Applicant responded to the SOR
on June 21, 2018 (Answer) and denied creating the duplicate payroll checks, then cashing
them. An arrest warrant was issued on June 18, 2018, and she turned herself in to police.
Since she could not afford an attorney, a public defender was assigned to her case. The
public defender advised her to pay restitution for the duplicate payroll checks that were
fraudulently cashed, and she did. In return, the prosecutor dropped the charges. (Answer)
Applicant’s FBI criminal history record reflects the arrest for larceny by check on
September 12, 2016, and the case dismissal on December 12, 2016. (Item 6) However,
the offense report from the sheriff’s department involved, reflects that on May 4, 2016,
Applicant came in to report that persons unknown cashed two false payroll checks in her
name at local retail stores after Applicant cashed the original check at a bank. (Item 5)
Interestingly, when sheriff’s deputies checked the loss detection video tapes in these local
stores,  they  clearly  show  Applicant  cashing  the  two  checks.  In  her  personal  subject
interview (PSI), Applicant stated she left this employer by mutual agreement. (Item 4) This
contradicts her assertion in section 13A of her SCA (Employment Activities) that she was
fired.  She  also  stated  “I  have  absolutely  no  idea  how  these  checks  were  printed  or
cashed.” (Answer) She also stated it “was a poor decision on my part.”
