Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  cited  as  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.f.  After  a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact. Applicant is 56 years old. He has been married since 1995.
He has two daughters, ages 23 and 21. He earned his bachelor’s degree in 2016. He
has held a DOD security clearance since approximately 1997. He has been employed
as  an  aviation  project  lead  for  a  federal  contractor  since  September  2007.  His  current
salary is about $85,000, and his wife’s annual salary is about $30,000. (Tr. 13-16)
Applicant  and  his  spouse  currently  live  in  his  parents’  home.  His  parents  have
agreed  to  allow  them  to  live  in  their  home  for  free  until  both  of  their  granddaughters
have graduated from college. Applicant pays rent for his two adult daughters, one who
graduated from college in May 2018, and the younger one, now a senior in college. He
estimated  that  he  pays  approximately  $3,000  total  each  month  for  their  rent,  utilities,
and  food.  He  also  pays  for  insurance  on  four  cars,  and  for  his  daughters’  cell  phone
service. He recently started paying $210 a month for his oldest daughter’s student loan,
which became due shortly after her 2018 college graduation. He is paying this amount
currently until his daughter is established and can start paying for her student loans. (Tr.
20-23, 41-42, 49)
Financial Considerations
The SOR alleged in ¶ 1.a that Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in March
2013. His liabilities totaled approximately $250,603. The bankruptcy was discharged in
April  2018.  Applicant’s  financial  issues  are  attributed  to  a  real  estate  business  his
spouse  started  in  approximately  2007.  They  also  purchased  a  more  expensive  home
that year, anticipating a second income from his spouse. Within a year or two, her real
estate  career  ended  after  her  business  failed  during  the  housing  market  crisis.  In
addition,  in  approximately  2010,  his  daughter  suffered  a  sports-related  injury,  which
required  three  surgeries.  Without  the  anticipated  income  from  his  spouse,  Applicant
admitted they were living beyond their means. They started using credit cards to pay for
their  food  and  other  living  expenses.  All  of  these  factors  contributed  to  Applicant’s
decision  to  file  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  in  2013.  He  made  monthly  payments  to  the
bankruptcy  trustee  through  payroll  deduction  until  the  bankruptcy  was  successfully
discharged in 2018. (Tr. 24-29, 31-32; GE 2)
The SOR alleged in ¶¶ 1.b-e, four student loans referred for collection with the
Department  of  Education  (DOE),  with  a  combined  total  of  $22,799.  Applicant  was  a
project  lead  with  his  employer  working  on  DOD  contracts.  One  of  the  DOD  contracts
required all project leads to have a bachelor’s degree. Applicant only had an associate’s
degree.  He  took  college  classes  online  and  graduated  with  his  bachelor’s  degree  in
2016.  He  took  out  student  loans  every  semester  for  two  years  beginning  in  January
2014  to  pay  for  his  classes.  Two  years  of  his  Federal  tax  refunds  were  intercepted  to
pay the outstanding balance of his student loans. Beginning in June 2018, he started a
rehabilitation  loan  agreement  where  he  is  to  pay  $329  a  month  for  11  consecutive
months  to  rehabilitate  his  student  loans.  After  his  April  2019  payment,  his  loan  will  be
considered  rehabilitated  and  he  can  negotiate  with  the  creditor  for  a  lower  monthly
payment.  Applicant’s  monthly  payments  are  automatically  deducted  from  his  bank
account. He provided a copy of his student loan rehabilitation agreement on January 22,
2019.  (Tr. 34-41, 48-49; AE A)
The  last  delinquent  debt  alleged  in  the  SOR  (¶  1.f)  is  a  medical  account  in  the
amount of $147. In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he stated he was unaware of this
account until the SOR was issued. In June 2018, he paid this account in full. He did not
provide  supporting  documentation  with  his  SOR  response  or  during  his  hearing.
Applicant provided a copy of his receipt on January 22, 2019. (Tr. 42-43; AE B)
Applicant and his spouse established a revised monthly budget in January 2019
after taking financial planning classes through their church. His youngest daughter will
graduate  from  college  in  May  2019,  and  she  expects  to  start  working  immediately
thereafter.  He  expects  a  substantial  decrease  in  their  monthly  expenses  after  they  no
longer  have  to  pay  her  monthly  expenses.  With  the  new  budget,  Applicant’s  income
covers all of the monthly expenses. They use a cash envelope system which works well
for them and prevents use of credit cards to pay for monthly bills. His wife pays for the
family health insurance through her employment. Her monthly net pay is approximately
$800, which they have been putting into a savings account. Applicant provided a copy
of their monthly budget on January 22, 2019. (Tr. 50-52; AE C)
