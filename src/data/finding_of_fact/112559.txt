Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g. She denied
those in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d. Her admissions are incorporated into these findings.
Applicant  is  54  years  old  and  never  married.  She  has  a  14-year-old  daughter,
whom she supports. She earned a bachelor’s degree in 1988 and a master’s degree in
1998. She began working for her current employer, a defense contractor, in September
2017. (Tr. 17-22)
.
Applicant earns $106,000 annually. Prior to this position, she worked for another
federal contractor from June 2016 to September 2017 and earned $68,000 a year. She
was  unemployed  from  December  2015  to  June  2016,  after  being  laid  off  by  a  federal
contractor  for  whom  she  worked  from  October  2012  to  December  2015.  She  earned
$90,000 annually during those three years. (Tr. 22-23; GE 1)
Based  on  a  credit  bureau  report  (CBR)  from  November  2017,  the  SOR  alleged
seven financial security concerns: a 2015 Chapter 7 bankruptcy; a state tax debt; a retail
store  debt;  an  electric  bill;  an  automobile  repossession;  a  foreclosed  mortgage;  and  a
tollway debt. The debts accumulated between 2016 and 2017 and totaled $28,133. (GE
3) The status of each allegation is as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a: Applicant’s financial problems were exacerbated when she was laid off
in  2015  and  unable  to  pay  her  bills.  (Tr.  26)  In  October  2015,  she  filed  a  Chapter  13
bankruptcy in an effort to save her home from foreclosure.1 The case was dismissed in
April 2016 because she was unable to make the payments as a result of the layoff. None
of the debts included in the bankruptcy were discharged. (Tr. 24-29)
SOR ¶ 1.b: The $3,000 state tax debt from 2003 is unresolved. Applicant admitted
that she owed the debt. (Answer) She said she tried to negotiate a resolution a year ago,
but could not afford the state’s offer. On the morning of this hearing, November 6, 2018,
she made a $310 payment on a repayment plan she established, which requires her to
make monthly payments of $60. This debt was included in her Chapter 13 bankruptcy.
Applicant said she had been disputing this debt for years. (Tr. 29-33, 63, 73; GE 2; AE A)
Post-hearing, she submitted a document indicating that the debt was deleted from her
credit report. However, that document is insufficient to prove that she paid the debt or is
no  longer  responsible  for  it,  given  her  admissions  and  the  documentary  evidence
indicating that it is her debt. (AE 1) This debt is unresolved.
1 The bankruptcy petition included $37,523 in accounts, including $29,000 of student loans. It also recorded
a $3,000 state tax debt. (GE 2)
SOR ¶ 1.c: This $841 delinquent debt is owed to a retail store for a 2015 purchase.
Applicant credibly stated that she did not owe it and had notified the store that she had
returned an item in question. She hired a credit repair company to dispute it. (Tr. 34-37)
It was removed from her credit report in December 2018. (AE 1) This debt is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.d: The $110 unpaid electric bill is resolved. Applicant credibly said she
paid it in 2017. (Tr. 38-39) It was removed from her credit report in January 2018. (AE 1)
SOR ¶ 1.e: Applicant admitted that she owed the $18,932 debt for an automobile
repossession. (Answer) She purchased a $26,000 car in May 2013 and stopped making
payments in 2015 after her layoff. She never made a subsequent payment on the debt.
She spoke to the creditor in July 2018 about resolving it. She was unable to settle the
debt for $8,000, as offered by the creditor, because she did not have enough money. A
week prior to this hearing, she contacted an attorney to inquire about resolving the debt.
(Tr. 39-43) It is unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.f: In December 2009, Applicant purchased a home. Between 2012 and
2013,  she  had  difficulty  paying  her  monthly  $2,000  mortgage  payment  and  the  $460
homeowner’s assessment. She subsequently obtained a loan modification that resulted
in a minor decrease in the monthly payment in 2013. In October 2015, the bank foreclosed
on the property. In January 2017, the bank completed the foreclosure, sold the property,
and gave Applicant $2,000 as a payoff. (Tr. 24-29) This allegation is resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.g:  In  August  2018,  Applicant  established  a  payment  plan  to  resolve  a
$5,250 debt owed to a county for unpaid fines and tolls from 2016 and 2017. She agreed
to begin making monthly payments of $225 in August 2018. As of that date, the debt’s
balance  was  listed  as  $2,791.2  She  testified  that  she  had  not made  the  October  2018
payment. (Tr. 43-26; AE B) This debt is unresolved.
Applicant submitted a budget. Her net monthly income is $6,200. Her expenses
are $5,455, and include a $60 payment for her state tax debt; a $100 payment on the
tollway debt; and a $65 payment to the Internal Revenue Service for a 2016 Federal tax
debt of $4,000. She started that payment plan a month ago.3 She recently consolidated
her  student  loans  and  was  scheduled  to  make  monthly  payments  of  $195  toward  that
debt. She made a payment in October 2018. Her student loans total $28,000. She has
about $745 remaining at the end of the month that she uses for other expenses. She has
not participated in credit or budget counseling. (Tr. 49-52, 58, 72-74; AE 4)
A human resources (HR) individual from Applicant’s employer testified. He knows
that this proceeding involves Applicant’s finances, but has not reviewed the SOR. He has
2It is not clear why there is a difference in alleged balance and listed balance on the county’s document.
3 The SOR did not allege the Federal tax debt for 2016 as a security concern. Thus, it will not be considered
in analyzing disqualifying conditions. It may be considered in the analysis of mitigating conditions and the
whole-person concept, and an evaluation of Applicant’s credibility.
known Applicant for over a year. He said she has been a successful member of her team.
He had nothing negative to report. (Tr. 76-79)
