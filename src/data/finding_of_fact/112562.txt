Applicant denied ten of the eleven allegations contained in the SOR and provided
explanations. She admitted the allegation in ¶ 1.e. (Item 3)
Applicant is 36 years old and married since 2012. She has a seven-year-old child.
She has earned some college credits. She has worked for federal contractors since 2006
and has held a security clearance since 2008. (Item 4)
In May 2016, Applicant submitted an electronic Questionnaires for Investigations
Processing (e-QIP). In February 2018, she was interviewed by a government investigator
about  her  background  and  financial  delinquencies.  The  investigator  inquired  about  12
medical debts that became collection accounts in 2015 and appeared on her July 2016
credit bureau report (CBR). Applicant stated she did not recognize 10 of the accounts,
but would investigate them. She said she had two medical debts that she could not pay
after her son’s birth in April 2012, because she did not have enough money. She said she
subsequently paid them. (Item 8)
Based on the July 2016 CBR, the SOR alleged 11 delinquent medical debts that
totaled  $19,367.  They  arose  between  August  2011  and  December  2012,  and  became
collection accounts between September 2015 and November 2015. In her Answer to the
SOR, Applicant stated that she was only responsible for one debt, ¶ 1.e.1 She said she
was making payments on it and had lowered the balance. She did not submit proof of her
assertion. She stated that she had no knowledge of the other 10 alleged debts. (Items 3,
8)
With her Answer to the SOR, Applicant provided an August 2016 document from
a credit-reporting agency indicating that it deleted numerous debts after investigating the
disputes she filed regarding them. The following debts were disputed and deleted: ¶ 1.c
for $3,528; ¶ 1.g for $757; ¶ 1.h for $625; and ¶ 1.i for $584. Applicant did not provide
evidence documenting the basis for her disputes or the deletions. (Item 3)
1 In her Answer, Applicant confused two SOR debts. She misstated the amount of the alleged debt in ¶
1.e as $2,936. The correct amount in ¶ 1.e is $1,859. The amount of $2,936 is alleged in ¶ 1.d, and is
seemingly the debt she said she is paying. (Item 3)
Applicant submitted a November 2016 credit report from another credit-reporting
agency  noting  that  the  following  debts  were  “no  longer  on  file”  and  removed  from  her
credit report: ¶ 1.a for $3,806; ¶ 1.b for $3,717; ¶ 1.d for $2,936; ¶ 1.f for $811; and ¶ 1.j
for  $375.  She  did  not  provide  any  evidence  documenting  the  basis  for  removal  of  the
debts from her credit report, such as they were wrongly reported, or the debts were paid.
She stated that she also needed to have the credit bureaus remove the debt alleged in ¶
1.k for $369, but gave no reason. (Item 3)

restoration  program  since  August  2016.  The  program  provides  budget  and  credit
counseling services. (AE A) She did not provide a budget or other information related to
her financial obligations from which to determine current financial reliability or compliance
with payment agreements.

of  the  evaluations  consistently  rate  her  as  “meeting  expectations”  and  “exceeding
expectations” in various categories. (AE A)
