Applicant,  44,  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  federal  contractor,  since
January  2018.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance,  at  varying  levels  of  access,  since
1996.  He  completed  his  most  recent  security  clearance  application  in  August  2017,
while  being  sponsored  by  another  company.  The  ensuing  background  investigation
revealed  several  delinquent  debts.  The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  owes  $50,911  in
delinquent  accounts,  including  a $301,000 mortgage  that  was  $7,000  in  arrears at  the
time the SOR was issued. Applicant’s financial problems stem from his move to another
city in 2015.4
Applicant worked as a civilian employee of the federal government from 2010 to
2016.  His  wife  was  also  a  civilian  employee  for  the  same  agency,  but  in  a  different
organization.    In  2015,  they  had  a  household  income  of  approximately  $200,000.  In
2015,  Applicant  and  his  wife  decided  to  relocate  with  their  son  from  City  1  to  City  2.
They wanted their son to attend high school in a community better suited to his needs.
They purchased a home in City 2 in December 2014 for approximately $301,000. They
maintained  homes  in  both  locations,  until  they  sold  the  home  in  City  1  in  December
2015.  Applicant  planned  to  transfer  his  position  to  a  satellite  office  near  City  2.
Applicant’s  wife’s  position  was  not  eligible  for  transfer,  so  she  resigned  from  federal
employment in July 2015. Appellant received approval to transfer to the satellite office in
November 2015 and worked there for one year.5
Applicant’s  wife  launched  a  business  in  2015.  It  generated  approximately
$20,000  in  revenue  in  2016.  Applicant’s  estimates  their  household  income for 2016  at
$120,000. When Applicant learned the satellite office was closing in December 2016, he
was  given  the  opportunity  to  move  his  position  back  to  City  1.  Instead,  he  chose  to
2  Upon  reading  the  transcript  in  this  case,  I  discovered  that  the  email  address  Applicant  provided  for
receipt of an electronic transcript was incorrectly transcribed. Concerned that he did not receive a copy of
the  transcript  as  required  pursuant  to  Additional  Procedural  Guidance  ¶  E3.1.24,  I  sent  the  parties  an
electronic  copy  of  the  transcript  to  their  respective  email  addresses  of  record  on  April  5,  2019.  I  also
reopened  the  record  to  allow  Applicant  to  submit  the  items  as  requested  in  the  transcript.  In  his
conformation  of  receipt  of  the  transcript,  Applicant  indicated  he  attempted  to  submit  his  post  hearing
submission to Department Counsel and me on December 4, and again on December 28, 2018. Neither
Department counsel nor I received the emails,  which  were likely blocked by the  security features of the
DOHA email system. On April 9, 2019, Applicant provided a copy of his December 28, 2018 post-hearing
submission email and the attached documents. (HE II.)

resign  from  federal  employment,  citing  the  long  commute,  which  was  more  than  two
hours each  way.  He  was  unable  to find  comparable  employment  in  City  2.  He  worked
temporary  jobs  as  they  became  available  and  helped  his  wife  with  her  business.  He
estimates their household income for 2017 at $65,000, consisting of $10,000 in income
from  the  business  and  $55,000  withdrawn  from  their  retirement  accounts.  They  also
relied on credit cards to cover their living expenses. Their mortgage became delinquent
and the mortgage holder initiated foreclosure proceedings. The nine credit cards alleged
in the SOR (¶¶ 1.b through 1.j), also became delinquent during 2017.6
In January 2018, Applicant learned about a federal government facility in City 3,
about  90  miles  from  his  home.  He  secured  a  position  earning  $87,000.  As  of  the
hearing, his wife’s business generated approximately $30,000 in revenue for 2018. She
also  returned  to  full-time  employment  in  November  2018,  earing  $20  per  hour.  Since
January 2018, Applicant has paid the $7,000 past-due balance on his mortgage (SOR ¶
1.a) and the $2,000 past-due amount on his car loan, which is not alleged in the SOR.
Both accounts are current. He has also resolved the debt alleged at SOR ¶ 1.j ($1,071).
In  February  2018,  he  established  a  payment  plan  for  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.d
($7,649) for $230 each month. He has paid $2,300 toward this debt. In October 2018,
he established a payment plan or the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i ($1,325) for $55.23 per
month and has reduced this debt by $110. Applicant has also paid $300 toward the debt
alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.h  ($2,087).  The  debts  alleged  in  SOR    ¶¶  1.b,  1.c,  1.e,  and  1.f,
remain unresolved.  Applicant contacted the creditor holding SOR ¶ 1.k ($110), but the
creditor did not have any record of the account.7
Before 2017, Applicant enjoyed a favorable financial history. He does not have a
history of delinquent debt or financial problems.
