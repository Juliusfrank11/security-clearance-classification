Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 54-year-old senior configuration
manager employed by a U.S. defense contractor since March 2017.  He served in the
U.S.  military  for  four  years  in  the  late  1980's—during  which  time  he  held  a
clearance—and  was  honorably  discharged.  He  claims  to  have  held  an  industrial
clearance since 2005 (GE 1).
The  SOR  alleges,  Government  exhibits  substantiate,  and  Applicant  admits  four
delinquent debts totaling over $131,000. The debts comprise $128,110 of a charged-off
home equity line of credit and two charged-off  credit cards (SOR 1.a-1.c)4  held by the
same creditor, and $2,627 of a charged-off store credit card (SOR 1.d).
Although  Applicant  did  not  report  any  financial  problems  on  his  January  2017
clearance application (GE 1), he volunteered his financial problems—including the SOR
debts—during a February 2018 interview with a Government investigator (GE 2), based
on his June 2017 credit report (GE 3). He  told the investigator that he thought he had
received a Form 1099-C covering SOR debt 1.a.
AE  A  shows  that  the  SOR  1.a  creditor  issued  Applicant  an  Internal  Revenue
Service  (IRS)  Form  1099-C  (Cancellation  of  Debt)  for  the  SOR  amount  for  tax  year
2016; issued Applicant a Form 1099-C for the SOR 1.b amount for tax year 2017; and
issued Applicant a Form 1099-C for the SOR 1.c amount for tax year 2018. The SOR
1.d  creditor  did  not  issue  Applicant  a  Form  1099-C.  The  Form  1099-Cs  do  not  state
when the forms were issued, only the tax year covered.
Applicant claims, without corroboration, that he tried to work out a payment plan
with  the  creditor  for  SOR  debts  1.a-1.c,  but  was  unsuccessful  because  once  the
accounts  were  charged  off,  the  creditor  insisted  on  a  full,  lump  sum,  payment.  He
claims, also without corroboration, to have reported the debt cancellations as income in
the noted years, as required. However, applicant did not submit copies of his income tax
returns  to  corroborate  that  claim; 5  the  2016  tax  transcript  Applicant  submitted  did  not
report a gross income figure, and the adjusted gross income figure the transcript reports
is less than the $100,000 amount of forgiven debt. Moreover, Applicant discovered that
3Previously, he worked for a different vendor in support of the same user agency from October 2016 to March
2017, and with yet another vendor for the same user agency from April-September 2016. He had previously
been employed with yet a third vendor for the same user agency from May 2005 to July 2013, when he was
laid off.
4The line of credit and two credit cards are Applicant’s individual debts; the store credit card is a joint account
with his wife (GE 3).
5Moreover, Applicant’s September 2018 response to DOHA interrogatories (GE 2) included a July 2018 IRS
tax account transcript for tax year 2016 that records an adjusted gross income that is too low to include the
amount of debt forgiven. Applicant did not submit tax account transcripts for 2017 or 2018, so there is no
evidence to show whether Applicant’s adjusted gross income for those years reflects the amounts of forgiven
debt.
the cancellation of debt applies only to his tax calculations; it does not relieve him of his
legal  obligation  to  pay.  Yet,  while  the  creditor  has  apparently  not  taken  any  action  to
recover the debts, Applicant appears to have undertaken no efforts to have the creditor
formally  commit  to  not  pursue  the  debts  further.  Applicant  has  taken  no  action  to
address the delinquent store credit card.
Applicant  attributes  his
to  his  unemployment  and
underemployment between about July 2013 and May 2014. While this may explain the
delinquencies of SOR debts 1.a-1.c, each of which was last acted upon February-March
2014, this does not explain the delinquent store credit card, which was last acted upon
in December 2011 (GE 3).
financial  problems
In addition to not providing any evidence of efforts to deal with the specific debts,
Applicant  documented  no  credit  or  financial  counseling.  He  submitted  no  budget.  He
submitted  no  work  or  character  references,  or  any  evidence  of  civic  or  community
involvement.
