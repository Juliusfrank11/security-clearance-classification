Applicant  is  a  33-year-old  senior  consultant  who  has  been  employed  by  a
defense  contractor  since  August  2012.  He  requires  a  security  clearance  for  this
employment. He was previously granted an interim secret clearance in 2012, which was
approved  in  2014.  Applicant  is  single  and  has  no  children.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s
degree in 2009. (Tr. 9-10, 16-17)
In  February  2012,  Applicant  went  to  New  Orleans  for  a  vacation  during  Mardi
Gras. Over the course of the day, he consumed several alcoholic drinks with his friends.
Applicant  continued  to  drink  that  night,  he  became  intoxicated,  but  could  not  find  a
public restroom. While Applicant was urinating outdoors in a public area, a police officer
approached  him,  and  gave  him  a  citation  for  lewd  conduct.  Applicant  hired  a  local
attorney  to  represent  him  in  absentia  at  his  court  hearing,  and  the  citation  was
dismissed. (GE 1 at 41; GE 2 at 13; GE 5 at 5; Tr. 17-20, 42-43)
Applicant  disclosed  the  2012  incident  in  his  2012  and  2016  SCAs,  because  he
was advised to “include anything and everything.” The incident above occurred shortly
before  he  completed  his first  SCA;  however,  Applicant  did  not  disclose  the  incident  to
his facility security officer (FSO) or program manager.1 (GE 1 at 41; GE 2 at 13; Tr. 42-
43)
In  March 2013,  Applicant  had  plans  to attend  a  National Hockey  League  (NHL)
game after work with a coworker, during the middle of the week. That morning when he
went to work, he left his vehicle outside of a public transportation center in anticipation
of his evening plans. Applicant consumed three beers at the game, he went to at least
one bar after the game, and consumed two liquor drinks. (GE 1 at 42; GE 2 at 3, 13-14;
Tr. 20-23, 44-45)
At the end of the night, Applicant took public transportation to his car and  drove
for  approximately  five  to  seven  minutes. While  he  was  driving,  he  felt  intoxicated,  and
decided  to  pull  his  vehicle  over  to  the  side  of  the  road  and  sleep.  He  slept  for
approximately an hour, when a police officer knocked on the window of Applicant’s car
and  woke  him  up.  Applicant  was  sitting  in  the  driver’s  seat  and  the  keys  were  in  the
ignition.  Applicant  failed  the  field  sobriety  tests.  He  was  given  a  breathalyzer,  and  his
blood  alcohol  content  (BAC)  was
.13%.  He  was  arrested  and  charged  with
driving/attempting  to  drive  a  vehicle  while  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  (DUI).
Applicant’s license was suspended for a period prior to the court hearing. The arresting

parents or coworkers about the 2012 lewd conduct citation. (GE 2 at 13)
officer  did  not  appear  at  Applicant’s  court  hearing,  and  the  charges  were  dismissed.2
(GE 2 at 3, 13-14; GE 3; Tr. 20-23, 44-46)
Applicant  testified  that  after  the  2013  arrest,  he  did  not  seek  counseling  or
treatment,  but  he  changed  his  behavior for a  period  of  time.  He  used  ride  shares  and
stopped  drinking  for  a  few  months  before  his  court  hearing.  After  the  charges  were
dismissed, he resumed the consumption of alcohol. (GE 2 at 14; Tr. 23-24)
In August 2017, Applicant  went out for dinner on a work night  with a friend and
consumed a couple of drinks. After dinner they went to the friend’s parents’ house and
he had approximately two more drinks. He testified that did not intend to drink alcohol,
but  consumed  approximately  four  drinks  in  four  to  five  hours,  and  he  thought  he  was
sober  enough  to  drive.  He  left  the  house,  drove  five  minutes,  and  then  pulled  over  to
rest. After sleeping for approximately 45 minutes, a police officer approached his vehicle
and  woke  him.  Applicant  was  sitting  in  the  driver’s  seat  with  the  keys  in  the  ignition.
Applicant failed the field sobriety tests, and his BAC results were .14%. He was arrested
and charged with (DUI). The arresting officer did not come to his court hearing, and the
charges were dismissed in December 2017. (GE 2 at 3, 14-15, 17; GE 4; Tr. 24-29, 48)
Applicant  did  not  seek  treatment  or  counseling  after  his  third  alcohol-related
arrest. He testified that he was relieved that the charges were dropped, he reflected on
the incident, stopped drinking for a few weeks, but did not believe that alcohol classes
would  have  been  “beneficial.”  Applicant  resumed  drinking  after  the  2017  DUI  charges
were dismissed in late 2017. (GE 2 at 6; Tr. 28-31, 33-34, 47, 49)
In  his  September  2018  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  indicated  he  intended  to
seek an alcohol evaluation, and he was abstaining from the consumption of alcohol. On
January 1, 2019, he paid for an alcohol and drug evaluation from a private facility. The
assessment found that Applicant does not need treatment. (Answer; AE A; AE D)
Applicant  testified  that  he  continued  to  drink  after the  SOR  was  issued,  and  he
last  consumed  alcohol  a  few  weeks  before  the  hearing.  After  each  of  the  incidents
alleged in the SOR, Applicant told government investigators that he intended to modify
his consumption of alcohol. (Answer; GE 5 at 5; GE 2; AE A; AE C; AE D; Tr. 15, 32-33,
35-37)
Applicant’s  two  DUI  arrests  occurred  on  work  nights.  He  testified  that  on  both
occasions, he drove, in part, because it was a work night, and he wanted to get home to
be  responsible,  sleep,  and  then  go  to  work  the  next  day.  Following  both  arrests,
Applicant was taken into custody, and his vehicle was towed. He was released early in
the  morning  on  both  occasions  and  called  into  work  as  sick,  and  did  not  disclose  the
arrests to his FSO. In his notes that he prepared for the hearing, Applicant stated that
he “wasn’t really driving” before the 2013 and 2017 arrests.  (AE C at 1; Tr. 21, 25; 62-
63)
2 During his October 2017  government interview,  Applicant told the investigator that he had not told  his
parents or coworkers about the 2013 arrest. (GE 2 at 14)
Throughout his six and half years of employment for his company, Applicant has
attended yearly security clearance training. He was aware that he had a duty to report
derogatory  or  adverse  information  to  his  employer.  Applicant  testified  that  he  was
unsure  if  he  was  required  to  report  information  prior  to  a  final  determination  and  if  he
was required to report the two DUI arrests despite the dismissal of the charges. There is
no evidence that Applicant sought clarification on this issue. (AE C; Tr. 37-39)
Applicant  did  not  report  either  of  the  DUI  arrests  to  his  FSO  when  the  arrests
occurred. He testified that the arrests were embarrassing, and he was worried about his
job.  Applicant  did  disclose  the  2013  and  2017  arrests  to  the  government  investigator
during his interview in October 2017. (GE 1 at 41-42; Tr. 39-41, 46-47, 50-56)
Applicant presented a reference letter from his program manager. She found him
to be reliable and effective in his role at the company. (AE B; Tr. 15)
