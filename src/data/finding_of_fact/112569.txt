In his Answer and Supplemental Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without
comments, both of the factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct in the SOR (SOR
¶¶  1.a.  and  1.b.),  and  nearly  all  of  the  factual  allegations  pertaining  to  financial
considerations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 2.b. through 2.i.), although he disputed the amount
set forth in SOR ¶ 2.f. He failed to respond with an “admit” or “deny” to SOR ¶ 2.a., so a
denial was registered for him. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings
of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. The record is silent
as to the position that he now holds, and when he joined his new employer. A 1999 high
school graduate, Applicant received some college credits, but no degree. He enlisted in
the U.S. Army in July 1999, and served on active duty until August 2003, when he was
administratively  discharged,  and  issued  a  General  Discharge  Under  Honorable
Conditions. He stated that he was granted access to sensitive compartmented information
(SCI) in 2000 and 2008, but did not identify the level of the clearances granted, and a
subsequent application for a security clearance  was denied. Applicant has never been
married, and he reports no children.
Personal Conduct
In September 2011, Applicant’s application for a security clearance was denied by
another government agency when it was determined that he had 20 delinquent accounts,
totaling more than $18,000 ;  because  he  had  misused  corporate  credit  cards  issued  to
him  by  two  former  employers  (in  March  2005,  when  he  charged  $3,000;  and  in  2008-
2009,  when he  charged  $29,000); and  because  he  had  received a  General Discharge
Under Honorable Conditions from the U.S. Army, in part because he wrote checks with
insufficient funds.1
On October 12, 2017, Applicant was terminated by his employer for willful misuse
of  company  assets,  by  continuously  charging  non-business  related  expenses  on  his
company credit card in violation of company policies. A review of his credit card usage
revealed  over  $7,500  in  personal  charges,  including  more  than  $4,000  in  rental  car
transactions; $1,200 on Uber transactions; $623 on cable television costs; and over $800
at a sports bar with billiards. In addition, Applicant allowed the account to become over
130 days delinquent, resulting in the card being cancelled and the balance of over $7,500
being charged to the company.2
Financial Considerations3
It is unclear when Applicant first started having financial difficulties, and he did not
identify  any factors that  contributed  to  them. The  record  does  refer to  three  periods  of
unemployment:  August  2003  until  September  2003;  September  2006,  for  less  than  a
month  when  he  was  fired  because  he  repeatedly  failed  to  come  to  work  on  time;  and
November 2006 until May 2007. Because of his financial difficulties Applicant apparently
had  insufficient funds to  cover all  of  his monthly  bills,  and  corporate  credit  cards  were
sometimes used by him. Accounts became delinquent, some accounts were charged off,
judgments  were  filed  against  him,  and  one  vehicle  was  repossessed.  Some  of  those
delinquent  debts  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.4  Applicant  never  received  financial
counseling.
In addition to the three company credit-card accounts described above, the SOR
identified eight delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection or charged off as
1 Item 3 (e-QIP, dated March 30, 2012), at 41-42; Item 4 (e-QIP, dated August 13, 2015), at 44-46;
Item 2 (Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, dated July 17, 2018), at 1; Item 5 (Personal Subject Interview, dated
June 6, 2012), at 1, 7.
2 Item 8 (Employment Records – Termination of Employment, dated October 12, 2017).
3 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in
the following exhibits: Item 9 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated August
20, 2015); Item 10 (Equifax Credit Report, dated April 12, 2018); Item 8, supra note 2; Item 5, supra note
1); Item 6 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated June 20, 2017); Item 6 (Subject Contact, dated August 10,
2017); Item 3, supra note 1; Item 4, supra note 1; and Item 2, supra note 1.
4 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal
Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to
evaluate  an  applicant's  evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to  consider
whether  an  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful  rehabilitation;  (d)  to  decide  whether  a  particular
provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis
under Directive § 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No.
02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also
ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd.
Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant’s unlisted and unalleged
delinquent accounts will be considered only for the five purposes listed above.
generally reflected by Applicant’s August 2015 or April 2018 credit reports. Those debts,
totaling approximately $27,364, none of which were addressed or resolved by Applicant
since his June 2012, June 2017, or his August 2017 interviews with an investigator from
the  U.S.  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM),  are  described  as  follows:  an
automobile loan that was charged off in the amount of $12,360 (SOR ¶ 2.b.); an apartment
lease with an unpaid balance of $8,813 (SOR ¶ 2.c.); a charge account that was charged
off in the amount of $3,841 (SOR ¶ 2.d.); a cable account with an unpaid balance of $799
(SOR ¶ 2.e.); a telephone account with an unpaid balance of $791 (SOR ¶ 2.f.); a medical
account with an unpaid balance of $482 (SOR ¶ 2.g.); an unspecified type of bank account
that was charged off in the amount of $153 (SOR ¶ 2.h.); and a medical account with an
unpaid balance of $125 (SOR ¶ 2.i.).
It is not known what Applicant’s current financial resources may be because he did
not report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder
that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a
budget. Applicant offered no evidence to indicate that his financial situation is now under
control.
