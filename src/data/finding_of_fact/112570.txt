Applicant is a 53-year-old information technology support technician, employed by
a defense contractor since 2009. He graduated from high school in 1984. He married in
2002 and has seven children, three of whom live with him. Applicant has never held a
security clearance.
The SOR alleges Applicant is delinquent on 17 debts totaling over $65,000; failed
to pay Federal income taxes for tax years 1995-1997, 1999, and 2000-2012; owes the
IRS for a tax lien totaling $13,930; and filed Chapter 13 bankruptcies in 1992, 2008, 2010,
2011, and twice in 2012. All of the bankruptcy filings were dismissed except for 1992 that
was discharged in 1995, and 2012 that was discharged in 2017. The SOR allegations are
supported  by  substantial  evidence.  Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  with
explanations except he denied a debt in SOR ¶ 1.m that he did not recognize. For some
debts he claimed to have included them in a credit repair agreement, and for others, he
claimed to have a payment plan. No documentary evidence of payment plans or credit
repair efforts was submitted.
Applicant attributes his poor financial status largely to caring for his parents in their
latter years and helping with their financial needs. His father passed away in 2005 and
his  mother  passed  away  in  2012.  Both  suffered  from  illnesses  and  did  not  have  the
financial  means  to  fully  support  themselves.  Applicant’s  spouse  has  had  an  erratic
employment  history  due  to  medical  conditions.  Applicant  also  had  a  significant  child-
support  obligation to  satisfy.  He  used  the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  system  to  attempt  to
gain  control  of  his finances,  however  three  of the bankruptcies  were  dismissed  due  to
Applicant’s  failure  to  make  plan  payments,  or  in  one  instance,  failure  to  file  required
documentation.  In  his  final  bankruptcy  discharged  in  2017,  he  claimed  $81,106  in
unsecured debts, and paid $31,281 in disbursements to creditors.
Applicant  testified  that  he  could  not  pay  his  taxes  when  due,  but  he  started  a
repayment plan with the IRS in November 2018. At the time of the hearing, he testified
that he made two monthly payments toward the plan, and that $418 per month will be
automatically deducted from his checking account. He noted that he owes the IRS about
$28,000.  Applicant  stated  he  has  made  three  monthly  installments  toward  a  utility
company debt (SOR ¶ 1.j), and owes about $500. No documentary evidence has been
offered to show that SOR debts have been addressed.
Applicant spoke to a credit repair agency in 2018 and paid the initial fees, however
he has not shown that the company has made any progress with his debts. He admitted
during testimony that he is delinquent on payments on a credit card debt that he obtained
to rebuild his credit because other financial needs arose. He also testified that he is behind
on student loan payments. These debts are not reflected on the SOR. He also admitted
that he has been irresponsible with debts and financially overextended over the years,
and currently lives paycheck-to-paycheck. His spouse is not working and his children help
pay utility bills because they do not want to see him in a poor financial situation.
Law and Policies
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484  U.S.  518, 528  (1988).  As  Commander  in  Chief,  the President  has  the  authority  to
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is  clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An
administrative  judge  must  consider  a  person’s  stability,  trustworthiness,  reliability,
discretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG ¶ 1(b).
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the
possible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant
has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the  President  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  have
established for issuing a clearance.
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the
personal  or  professional  history  of  the applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant from
being  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information.  The  Government  has  the  burden  of
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. “Substantial
evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. Washington
Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a
nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the  criteria  listed
therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3
(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015).
Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG ¶ 1(d).
