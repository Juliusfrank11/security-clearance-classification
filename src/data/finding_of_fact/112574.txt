Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 65 years old. He is married and has two adult children. He earned a
bachelor’s degree in 2000 and a master’s degree in 2016. He has also earned several
technical certificates.
Applicant disclosed on his August 2016 security clearance application (SCA) his
employment history as follows:
From May 2006-August 2007-employed in construction business;
From August 2007 to June 2008-unemployed;
From June 2008 to September 2009-employed;1
From September 2009 to February 2011-employed;
From  February  2011  to  May  2015-unemployed-attending  school,  attempting  to
acquire clients for self-employment; and
From May 2015 to the present-self-employed.2
The SOR alleges seven delinquent debts. Five are judgments entered from 2009
to 2013; including 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.a-$4,005); 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.b-$3,619); 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.c-
$21,810);  2010  (SOR  ¶  1.d-$2,858);  and  2009  (SOR  ¶  1.e-$13,472).  It  also  alleges  a
collection account  debt  in  SOR  ¶ 1.f  with  a balance  of $5,306 for a  credit  card,  and  a
delinquent state tax debt from 2005 in the amount of $18,160 in SOR ¶ 1.g. All of the
alleged debts total $69,230. Applicant’s admissions and a September 2016 credit report
corroborate the debts alleged in the SOR.3
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  difficulties  to  the  economic  downturn  in  2007-
2008.  He  worked  in  the  construction  business  at  the  time  and  this  impacted  his
employment. In his SOR answer, he stated that in 2006 he planned to purchase property
and build a new house. He intended to use the equity in his old house to pay down a
construction loan and reduce his mortgage payments. When the construction of the new
house was completed, his old house had been on the market for a year and had not sold.
1 Item 3. Applicant also listed that from February 2009 to September 2009 he was unemployed. This is
inconsistent with his other entry.
2 Item 3.
3 Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; AE A, B, C.
He converted his construction loan into a second mortgage. He stated that after two years
and only one income, presumably his wife’s, he had to do a short sale on the old house
to sell it. He stated that by then, he had depleted his cash savings and pension.
Applicant  stated  in  his  answer  to  the  SOR  that  another  factor  impacting  his
finances “was the loss of our records and return for the tax year 2005-2006.”4 He stated:
Never before this particular year, or since, had we failed to file a return, and
rarely did we owe taxes. Nevertheless, the return was apparently never filed
and by the time we found out about it, the interest and penalties were high.
We could only pay for either the federal or the state taxes at one time so we
opted to pay the federal debt first, which was recently satisfied. We currently
have an agreement to make payments on the state taxes.5
Applicant did not provide specific information as to when he learned his income
tax  filing  for  2005  was  delinquent  or  an  explanation  for  why  he  did  not  address  the
delinquent state tax debt for 12 years. He provided a document from the state tax office
showing in February 2017, he entered into an installment agreement to pay $341 a month
for  60  months  beginning  in  March  2017.  In  his  response  to  the  SOR,  he  provided  a
document from the state tax office that shows he has reduced the balance owed on the
$18,160 debt to $9,502 as of December 2018.6
Applicant stated in his SOR answer that due to his age and eyesight, employment
in the housing industry is not feasible even if a position was available. He is self-employed
and his income is much lower than it was in 2006.
In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  explained  that  his  strategy  to  resolve  his
debts was to negotiate lower payments and temporarily suspend paying some creditors
while  paying  his  main  obligations.  This  became  untenable,  and  he  suspended  paying
creditors  with  unsecured  debts,  such  as  those  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.f.  He
explained that his financial problems are not due to lack of self-control or poor judgment.
He has not sought bankruptcy protection. He intends to satisfy all of his debts when he
has the means.7
In  Applicant’s  response  to  the  FORM,  he noted  that  the  creditors alleged  in  the
SOR are not the original creditors because the delinquent debts were sold. He believes
the balances are inflated. He stated he will continue to negotiate payment of the debts.
Applicant did not provide any documentary evidence of actions he has taken to negotiate,
resolve, settle, or pay the judgments and collection debt alleged in the SOR. He did not

indicate if he has contacted any of the creditors. Applicant did not provide specific details
about his income. He did not provide information about whether his wife is employed, her
income, or if he provides support to others. He did not provide information about whether
he  has  a  budget  and  his  current  expenses.  Applicant’s  credit  bureau  report  from  April
2018 reports he has approximately 13 revolving accounts to which he is making current
monthly payments with a total cumulative balance of approximately $37,572. In addition,
he  is  making  payments  on  three  student  loans  totaling  approximately  $21,481,  and  a
monthly mortgage payment of approximately $2,849.8
