Applicant is 50 years old, and he was born in what is now South Sudan. In 1999,
Applicant and his wife fled Sudan and entered the United States. They were persecuted
by the Sudanese government due to their religion. Applicant and his wife were naturalized
in 2005. He has been married to his wife since 1999, and they have five children between
the ages of 8 and 18, all of whom were born in the United States. (Tr. 27-28, 101; GE 1;
GE 3 at 2, 8; AE H)
In 1995, Applicant received a college degree from a school in South Sudan, and
he  has  completed  some  college  courses  in  the  U.S.  Between  June  2006  and  January
2009, he served as a linguist in Iraq with the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps. During
this period, he was in Fallujah, Ramadi, and Baghdad, and subject to live fire. He was
granted  a  secret  security  clearance  in  2006,  and  he  received  a  top  secret,  sensitive-
compartmented information clearance in 2008. He is sponsored by a defense contractor
and requires a clearance for this position. (Tr. 17, 25-26, 30-35; GE 1; GE 3 at 2)
After Applicant returned to the United States  from Iraq in January 2009, he was
unemployed  for  eight  months.  He  was  then  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  from
August  2009  until  late  2011,  when  his  position  was  eliminated.  Applicant  struggled  to
regain  employment,  and  as  a  result,  in  the  spring  of  2009,  he  and  his  wife  started  a
trucking company. They owned a tractor-trailer truck, leased trailers, and hired operators
to drive their truck. They closed the business in 2012. (Tr. 17-18, 35-39; GE 1 at 18-21;
AE C)
In approximately May 2012, an individual filed a lawsuit against Applicant and his
company for $75,000. The plaintiff was supposed to buy Applicant’s truck, but the plaintiff
misplaced a trailer; as a result, Applicant cancelled the transfer of title for the truck. In
May 2019, the lawsuit against Applicant was dismissed. In June 2019, the lawsuit against
Applicant’s company was dismissed. At this time, there are no ongoing lawsuits against
Applicant or his company. (Tr. 37-39, 45-46; GE 1 at 71; GE 2 at 3; AE E; AE F; AE I)
After  Applicant  closed  his  trucking  company  in  2012,  he  was  unemployed  for
several months. To support his family, he moved to another state and drove a cab for
approximately one year. In 2014, Applicant and his wife opened a restaurant together.
Because  the  restaurant  was  not  doing  well,  Applicant  worked  for  other  businesses
between May 2017 and February 2018. At that time, they closed the restaurant because
it was not profitable. Applicant currently drives a supply truck and restocks gas stations
with vending supplies. His wife owns a cleaning business, and together they cater events
several times a year. (Tr. 41-44; GE 1 at 13-18; GE 2 at 2)
Due  to  Applicant’s  inability  to  find  consistent  employment  and  the  two  failed
business ventures, he fell behind on his mortgage payments. Applicant filed for Chapter
13  bankruptcy  protection  in  April  2016  to  avoid  foreclosure.  His  monthly  mortgage
payment  was  $1,500,  and  the  monthly  bankruptcy  payment  was  $1,000.  Because  his
restaurant was not doing well, he was unable to make the required bankruptcy payments,
and the bankruptcy was dismissed in November 2017. (Tr. 47-49, 97; GE 1 at 68-69; GE
2 at 3-4; GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 4; GE 5 at 2; GE 7)
Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in October 2017, and the plan
was confirmed in March 2018. Since the confirmation of the bankruptcy plan, he has made
monthly payments of $3,800. His mortgage is included in the bankruptcy plan as well as
the credit card debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 2.c and 2.d. (Tr. 49-51, 54-56, 60; GE 4 at 4; GE
5 at 2; GE 8)
Applicant and his wife follow a written budget, and they attended a Dave Ramsey
credit-counseling  class  through  their  church.  They  also  received  credit  counseling  in
conjunction  with  their  bankruptcies.  They  have  no  outstanding  debts  related  to  their
former  businesses.  They  owe  no  new  outstanding  income  taxes  and  have  timely  filed
their income tax returns for the past several tax years. Applicant brought to the hearing a
$3,800  money  order  that  reflected  his  March  bankruptcy  payment.  After  the  hearing,
Applicant provided a spreadsheet reflecting the payments he made between March and
May 2019 to the bankruptcy plan. Although he did not provide documentation of all of the
payments he has made since March 2018, when the plan was confirmed, he and his wife
testified  credibly  that  he  has  been  making  the  required  monthly  payments.  The
government offered no evidence to rebut his claims, and the admitted credit reports do
not show any new unalleged debts. (Tr. 61, 97-100, 104; GE 4; GE 5; GE 6)
South Sudan
South Sudan became an independent presidential republic in July 2011, when it
gained  its  independence  from  Sudan.  Shortly  thereafter,  conflict  arose  between  the
government and opposition forces, and it is an ongoing issue. Additionally, there has been
border conflict between South Sudan and Sudan and South Sudan and Uganda. As a
result, over a million people have been displaced and tens of thousands were killed. Due
to  ongoing  armed  conflict,  crime,  human  rights  issues,  including  extrajudicial  killings,
abuse, rape, and abduction, the U.S. Government advises against travel to South Sudan.
South Sudan is not known for intelligence-collection efforts against the United States or
U.S. citizens.
The Government did not request that I take administrative notice of any facts or
issues related to Uganda. (Tr. 83)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant’s  half-brother,  stepbrother,  and  brother-in-law
(sister’s husband) are citizens and residents of South Sudan, and they currently serve in
the South Sudanese Army. Applicant testified that all of these men are still citizens and
residents of South Sudan. He has not seen his half-brother since approximately 1997,
and the last time he spoke to him was in 2008. Applicant heard that his stepbrother is a
major in the South Sudan Army. Applicant met his stepbrother once when he was young

signify the service he provided to various military commands. Additionally, he received a
letter of appreciation related to his service in Iraq. The Marine officer described Applicant
as  invaluable,  diligent,  responsible,  hardworking,  and  devoted  despite  the  duress  of
enemy  fire.  The  Marines  with  whom  Applicant  worked  relied  upon  his  linguist  skills  in
“countless  tactical  interrogations,  convoys,  foot  patrols,  detainee  screenings,  and
document exploitations.” (Tr. 108; AE C; AE D)
