Applicant  is  a  45-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance for the first time. He is employed as a material program manager in the field
of  supply-chain  management  for  a  company  in  the  defense  industry.  He  has  been  so
employed  since  July  2016.  His  biweekly  base  pay  is  $3,401,  or  an  annual  salary  of
about  $81,624.  (Exhibit  A)  He  relocated  to  his  current  state  of  residence  in  mid-2016.
He attended college for many years, apparently on a part-time basis, during 1992-2001.
He was awarded a bachelor’s degree in 1999. He married in 2001 and divorced in 2005.
He has one child from the marriage. He has another child from a previous relationship.
He pays child support on an informal basis or agreement without the benefit of a court
order or written agreement.
Applicant  had  a  full-time  job  as  a  procurement  agent  for  a  large  aerospace
company from June 2002 to November 2014, when he was laid off due to a reduction in
force.  As a  result, he received  an  unspecified  amount  of  severance  pay.  He  was  then
unemployed or under employed until he began his current job in July 2016. He was out
of work from December 2014 to May 2015. He worked as a consultant from May 2015
to April 2016, and  was unemployed from May 2016 to July 2016. During the period of
unemployment  in  2015,  he  cashed  out  a  401(k)  account  from  his  previous  employer,
which withheld the tax due and the 10% penalty.
The SOR  concerns  a history  of financial problems  consisting  of failure  to  timely
file  state  and  federal  tax  returns  and  17  delinquent  accounts,  either  charged  off  or  in
collection,  for  about  $69,341  in  total.  Twelve  of  the  delinquent  accounts  are  student
loans  for  about  $49,658  in  total,  which  Applicant  used  to  attend  college  during  1999-
2001.  The  other  five  delinquent  accounts  are  credit  card  accounts  from  major  banks.
Four  of  these  accounts  were  reduced  to  judgment,  by  default,  as  reflected  in  county
court  records  from  2017  and  2018.  (Exhibit  2)  Department  Counsel  agreed  that  the
$5,000 unpaid judgment in SOR ¶ 1.t was a duplication of the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c or
1.f.  In  addition  to  his  admissions,  the  delinquent  accounts  are  established  by  the
documentary evidence (Exhibits 2-6). In both his answer to the SOR and in his hearing
testimony,  he  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  his  2014  job  layoff  and  the  resulting
period of unemployment and under employment.
Applicant  has  made  some  progress  in  repaying  the  delinquent  credit  card
accounts.  The  $6,144  charge-off  account  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  was  reduced  to  judgment  and
paid off through wage garnishment with a date of last payment in November 2018. (Tr.
33, 38-41; Exhibit B at 11) Likewise, the $4,489 charged-off account in SOR ¶ 1.f was
reduced to judgment and is being repaid through wage garnishment at the rate of $335
per  pay  period,  with  $1,005  paid  to  date.  (Tr.  33-34,  39-40;  Exhibit  A)  For  the  other
three delinquent credit card accounts, two of which were reduced to judgment, Applicant
stated that he is attempting to negotiate a payment arrangement with the creditors. (Tr.
34-35, 41-43) In addition to the wage garnishments, Applicant has two loans against his
current 401(k) account. (Exhibit A; Tr. 53-54)
Concerning the delinquent student loans, Applicant is currently paying $436 per
pay  period  on  those  accounts,  although  he  was  uncertain  if  the  payment  was  being
made directly to the Department of Education or a collection firm. (Tr. 32-33; Exhibit A)
He  did  not  present  a  current  account  statement  for  the  student  loans.  (Tr.  33)  He
estimated  the  current balance on  the  student  loan accounts  is about $50,000.  (Tr.  55)
The  student  loan  accounts  were  also  reduced  to  a  judgment,  which  is  being  paid
through wage garnishment. (Tr. 43-44; Exhibit A)
Turning to the tax matters, Applicant admitted failure to timely file an income tax
return for tax year 2014 in his state of previous residence. (Tr. 36-37) He also admitted
failure to timely file income tax returns for tax years 2016, 2017, and 2018 in his state of
residence since 2016. (Tr. 51-52) And he admitted failure to timely file a federal income
tax  return  for  tax  year  2014.  (Tr.  36-37)  To  date,  neither  the  state  nor  federal  returns
have been filed. He did not present any documentation from the state tax authorities or
the  IRS.  He  admitted  that  his  failure  to  timely  file  returns  was  due  to  oversight  and
failure on his part. (Tr. 44) In light of the wage garnishments, he admitted reducing his
tax withholdings to pay less tax and receive more income, which has resulted in having
tax due when returns were required to be filed. (Tr. 44-46)
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.6
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive

indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;
AG ¶ 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local
income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income
tax as required;
AG  ¶  20(c)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  a  death,  divorce,  or
separation,  clear  victimization  by  predatory  lending  practices,  or  identity
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and
AG ¶ 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax
authority  to  file  or  pay  the  amount  owed  and  is  in  compliance  with  those
arrangements.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.  The
disqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.
Turning to the matters in mitigation, it appears the genesis of Applicant’s financial
problems  was  the  November 2014  job  layoff.  That  event  resulted  in  a  nearly  two-year
period  of  unemployment  and  underemployment,  which  would  be  a  difficult  setback  for
anyone. Still, Applicant received severance pay, cashed out a 401(k) account, and had
some  earned  income  during  this  period,  so  he  was  not  completely  without  funds.
Further, his unemployment and under employment did not prevent him from timely filing
state  and  federal  income  tax  returns.  Given  these  circumstances,  the  mitigating
condition at AG ¶ 20(c) applies, but only in part, and Applicant receives limited credit in
mitigation.
Concerning  the  delinquent  student  loan  and  credit  card  accounts  for  more  than
$60,000, Applicant has not made “a good-faith effort” to resolve those matters. Although
one  of  the  charged-off  card  accounts  was  repaid  and  another  is  being  repaid,  that
occurred  due  to  wage  garnishments  to  enforce  money  judgments,  not  voluntary
payment plans arranged by Applicant. The same goes for the payments on the student
loan accounts, which were reduced to a judgment and are being repaid through a wage
garnishment.  Given  these  circumstances,  the  mitigating  condition  at  AG  ¶  20(d)  does
not apply.
Applicant has not made any progress in resolving the tax matters. The state and
federal  tax  returns  for  tax  year  2014  remain  unfiled.  What  is  more,  Applicant  has  not
gotten around to filing a state income tax return since relocating to his current state of
residence  in  2016.  He  presented  no  documentation  from  the  state  and  federal  tax
authorities.  He  is  a  long  way  from  being  in  compliance  with  state  and  federal  tax
authorities. Given these circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG ¶ 20(g) does not
apply.
Following Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to  protect
classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence
as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he
has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with
the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a -- 1.s:
Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.t:
For Applicant
Conclusion
It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for
access to classified information. Eligibility denied.
