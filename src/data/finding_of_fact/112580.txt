Applicant  disclosed  an  arrest  in  November  2015  for  misapplying  entrusted
federal  property  in  section  22  of  his  Security  Clearance  Application  (SCA).3  He  pled
guilty  in  March  2016  to  this  misdemeanor  offense  and  paid  a  $300  fine  and  $800  in
court costs. He admitted to dumping several flyers and newsletters in a dumpster while
he  was  employed  as  a  letter  carrier  with  the  U.S.  Postal  Service  (USPS).  Applicant
stated  he  resigned  from  the  USPS  under  adverse  circumstances  but  he  was  not
terminated.4
In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR  (Answer),  Applicant  admitted  two  of  the  three
delinquent  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  totaling  $37,340,  Including  the  $36,532  child
support  arrearage  alleged  at  SOR  1.a.  He  denied  the  debt  placed  for  collection  in  the
amount of $237 at SOR ¶ 1.c, stating that this account was paid in full as of June 22,
2018.  He  attached a  receipt documenting  this  payment  to his  Answer  to  the  SOR.  He
also attached an “Income Withholding for Support” agreement that he entered into with
his employer on February 16, 2018. This required Applicant to pay $1,012 per month in
child support based on an order from the county court in state A.
The  child  support  arrearage  arose  because  although  Applicant  pays  child
support,  his  payments  have  been  sporadic  due  to  chronic  unemployment.5  His  first

marriage in 1990 was to a German national. They had a son and a daughter together.
Applicant has had no contact with his son since 2004. Starting in 2006, a county court
ordered that Applicant’s pay be garnished in the amount of $1,052 and sent to Germany
via  the  county  court  in  state  A.  This  court  order  was  reaffirmed  in  2014.  Applicant
attached  a  one-page  payment  history  to  his  response  to  the  FORM,  reflecting  child
support  payments  of  $425  every  two  weeks  in  2017,  and  $506  every  two  weeks  (or
$1,012  a  month)  in  2018,  in  compliance  with  the  income  withholding  for  support
agreement. The last reported payment was made on August 17, 2018. He also attached
two character reference letters attesting to his work ethic, integrity and trustworthiness.
He admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b, for an automobile loan that is past due
in  the  approximate  amount  of  $571,  with  a  total  balance  of  $7,131.  In  his  clearance
interview,  applicant  claimed  that  he  opened  this  account  in  2005,  and  he  eventually
gave the vehicle to a friend who was supposed to take over payments on the loan. The
friend  reneged on his promise  to make  payments and  Applicant  attached a  letter from
the creditor dated June 26, 2018, to his Answer. It reflects a payment in the amount of
$291  was  verbally  authorized  in  June  2018,  and  Applicant  was  supposed  to  continue
making monthly  payments on this  automobile  loan, pursuant  to  this  verbal  agreement.
However, Applicant has provided no documents or evidence of the payment agreement,
aside from this one-time payment, to support his claims.
In his  Answer  to  the SOR,  Applicant  also  admitted the  allegation under  SOR ¶
2.a for personal conduct, his conviction for depositing postal flyers in the trash, with an
explanation. He was already punished for this misconduct on the job as a letter carrier,
when  he  paid  court  costs  and  a  fine.  He  felt  pressure  to  complete  his  mail  route  in  a
finite amount of time, which did not allow for additional advertising flyers to be delivered.
He was also forced to resign under adverse conditions.
