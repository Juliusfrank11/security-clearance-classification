The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  failed  to  file  his  Federal  and  State  income  tax
returns as required for tax years 2002, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and
2014.   He also failed to timely file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years
2015 and 2016.  Applicant failed to pay his 2003 Federal income taxes and they were
been written off by the IRS in 2015.  He owes  approximately $23,579 in  Federal back
taxes  and  approximately  $17,262  for  four  other  delinquent  debts.    In  his  answer,
Applicant  admitted  allegations  1.a.,  through  1.k.,  and  1.o.    He  was  not  aware  of  the
debts set forth in allegations 1.l., 1.m., and 1.n.
Applicant began working for his current employer in 2006 and worked there until
2009.    He  was  rehired  in  2015  and  he  has  worked  there  since  then.    On  August  23,
2018,  Applicant  was  offered  a  promotion  if  he  is  able  to  obtain  a  security  clearance.
Credit Reports of the Applicant dated August 10, 2017; and February 20, 2019, confirm
each of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.)
Applicant  experienced  several  long  periods  of  unemployment  that  has  affected
his ability to pay his debts.  He was unemployed from September 2008 to August 2009;
December  2009  to  October  2012;  June  2013  to  September  2014;  and  June  2015  to
March 2016.  He states that due to a bad economy, he was unable to find a suitable job.
During these periods, he collected unemployment benefits.  However, being off work for
so long, he became depressed, overwhelmed and despondent.  The little money he did
have he used to pay his rent and to survive.  (Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit B.)  He
states that he did not file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2002,
2004,  2005,  2006,  2007,  2009,  2010,  2012,  2013,  and 2014  because  he  did not  have
the money to file or pay his taxes.
Applicant  also  did  not  timely  file  his  Federal  or  State  income  tax  returns  for  tax
years 2015 and 2016.  As a result of not filing his 2003 Federal income tax returns, his
balance was written off by the IRS in 2015.  Applicant’s status report from the state tax
authority dated December 5, 2018, indicates that as of that date, Applicant had filed his
2011, 2015, 2016 and 2017 state income tax returns.  (Applicant’s Exhibit C.)
Applicant currently owes Federal income taxes for tax years 2006, in the amount
of  $3,191;  2007,  in  the  amount  of  $3,714;  2008,  in  the  amount  of  $1,297.51;  2015,  in
the amount of $9,074.05; 2016, in the amount of $2,662.21; and 2017, in the amount of
$3,639.84.  These taxes have not been paid and remain outstanding.  Applicant states
that  he  plans  to  start  a  payment  plan  with  the  IRS  to  resolve  this  debt  in  June  2019.
(Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit B.)
Applicant initially testified that all Federal and state income tax returns have been
filed and everything has been cleared up.  (Tr. p. 52.)  Applicant had no proof of filing
with  him,  nor  proof  that  he  has  paid  his  back  Federal  and/or  state  taxes.    Applicant
stated that he started filing his taxes about three years ago, when he started working for
his current employer.  The record was left open after the hearing to allow the Applicant
to provide this documentation.   Applicant did not provide it.  Applicant also testified that
if he receives his security clearance, the financial matters will be fixed immediately.  He
will  be  promoted and assigned  overseas,  and  the new  job  will allow  him  to  be  able  to
pay  his delinquent  taxes  and  other debts.    (Tr. pp.  60-62.)   Applicant  stated  that  he  is
not currently on a payment plan with the IRS, but he plans to set up a payment plan and
begin payments by next month.  (Tr. p. 62.)
Applicant  contends  that  in  early  2018,  his  personal  information  was  stolen  and
things have appeared on his credit report that he is not aware of, and that should not be
there.  Applicant is disputing some of the delinquent debts listed on his creditor reports,
and has placed a credit freeze and credit monitoring through the credit bureaus on his
reports.    (Applicant’s  Post-Hearing  Exhibit  B.)  He  initially  thought  that  the  following
debts were not his:
1.l.    A  delinquent  debt  owed  to  a  creditor  was  placed  for  collection  in  the
approximate  amount  of  $524.    Government  Exhibit  4  indicates  that  the  account  was
opened in 2016. Therefore, this debt had nothing to do with identity theft that took place
in 2018.  Also, Government Exhibit 2 shows that Applicant discussed the debt at length
with the interviewer.  Applicant now believes that it could be his debt.  Applicant recently
located  a  copy  of  the  “return  receipt”  showing  that  he  returned  the  equipment  to  the
creditor  and  that  there  is  no  balance  owed.    (Applicant’s  Post-Hearing  Exhibit  B.)
Applicant  states  that  he  is making  sure  that  the  debt  is  being  removed  from  his  credit
reports.
1.m.    A  delinquent  debt  owed  to  a  creditor  was  placed  for  collection  in  the
approximate  amount  of  $1,119.    Government  Exhibit  3  indicates  that  the  account  was
opened in June 2013.  Therefore, this debt had nothing to do with identity theft that took
place in 2018.  Applicant now believes the debt could be his debt.  (Tr. p. 68.)  In fact,
during  his  interview  with  the  investigator,  Applicant  disputed  the  debt  because  he
thought he had paid it, but he does not know for sure.  (Government Exhibit 2 and Tr. p.
69.)  Since the debt does not appear on the Applicant’s most recent credit report, it will
be assumed that the debt was paid.  (Tr. p. 70.)
1.n.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the amount
of  $619.    Government  Exhibit  4  shows  that  the  account  was  opened  December  2016.
Therefore,  this  debt  had  nothing  to  do  with  identity  theft  that  took  place  in  2018.
Applicant also discussed the debt with the investigator  and stated that he disputed the
debt.    (Government  Exhibit  2  and  Tr.  p.  71.)    Since  the  debt  does  not  appear  on
Applicant’s  most  recent  credit  report,  and  Applicant  states  that  he  did  not  pay  it,  it  is
assumed to be successfully disputed.  (Tr. p. 72.)
1.o.    A  delinquent  debt  to  a  creditor  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $15,000  is
being paid by the Applicant through garnishment.  Applicant pays $250 every pay period
toward the debt.  Applicant states that he has now paid back $7,406 of the $7500 owed
and when he pays it off in full, (when the garnishment is completed on June 1, 2019), he
will begin a payment plan with the IRS.  (Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit B.)
Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit A is a notice of account dispute, indicating that a
creditor has been removed from Applicant’s credit report.  The creditor is not one that is
listed in the SOR.  Applicant has never received any financial counseling to improve his
finances.  He is not adverse to the idea and believes it could be helpful.
Applicant admits to his financial mistakes of the past.  He indicates that he  has
solicited  advice  from  his  financial  officer  concerning  his  tax  problems  and  was  told  to
change his deductions on his W2 in order to avoid owing taxes at the end of the year.
Applicant  also  increased  his state  tax  each month  by  $50.    Applicant  states  that he  is
now taking ownership and responsibility for his finances and his life.  (Applicant’s Post-
Hearing Exhibit B.)
Guideline E – Personal Conduct
The  Government  alleges  that  the  Applicant  engaged  in  conduct  involving
questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules
and  regulations  that  raise  questions  about  his  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to
protect classified information.
In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  each  of  the  allegations  set  forth
under this guideline.  Applicant completed an e-QIP dated August 8, 2017.  Section 26,
Financial  Record  -  Taxes  asked,  “In  the  last  7  years  have  you  failed  to  file  or  pay
Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance?”  Applicant provided
information  on  tax  years  2013,  2015  and  2016.    He  failed  to  provide  any  information
about tax years 2010, 2012, and 2014.  (Government Exhibit 1.)
In his interrogatory response dated August 22, 2018, Applicant was asked “have
you  ever  failed  to  file  your  Federal  income  tax  returns  on  time?  .  .  .  if  yes,  list  which
years you failed to file your returns on time.”  Applicant failed to provide information that
he failed to file his Federal income tax returns on time for tax years 2002, 2004, 2005,
2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015.  (Government Exhibit 2.)
In that same interrogatory response, Applicant was asked “Have you ever failed
to  file  your  Federal  income  tax  returns  on  time?  .  .  .  if  yes,  list  which  years  are  not
currently filed.”  Applicant stated that, “all years have been filed.”  He did not list the fact
that his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009,
2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014 had not been filed.  (Government Exhibit 2.)
In that same interrogatory response, Applicant was asked, “Have you ever failed
to file your state income tax returns on time? . . . if yes, list which years you failed to file
your  state  returns  on  time”.    Applicant  did  not  provide  information  that  he  failed  to  file
state income tax returns for tax years  2002, 2004, 2005, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014,
and 2016.   (Government Exhibit 2.)
In that same interrogatory response, Applicant was asked, “Have you ever failed
to file your state income tax returns on time? . . . if yes, list which years are not currently
filed”.  Applicant failed to provide information that he had not filed his State income tax
returns for tax years 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2014.
(Government Exhibit 2.)
Applicant  explained  that  he  is  really  bad  with  times  and  dates.    His  memory  is
terrible.  And for the most part, he does not know why he answered the questions on his
e-QIP and in response to the interrogatories the way he did.  He does not remember his
mindset  and  at  the  time,  he  could  have  been  thinking  something  completely  different.
He may have misunderstood the question or made a mistake.  (Tr. p. 89 – 96.)
Performance  appraisals  of  the  Applicant  for  the  years  2016,  2017,  and  2018,
reflect  that  he  has  consistently  completed  all  of  his  goals,  has  a  strong  and  positive
work relationship with his team, and has mentored new employees.  (Applicant’s Exhibit
B.)
Letters of recommendation from various coworkers of the Applicant attest to his
hard working nature and tireless efforts to maintain the highest quality of products.  He
is considered to be an exceptional employee, who is caring, empathetic, and supportive
to  others.    If  he  does  make  a  mistake,  he  is  forthcoming  and  honest  about  them  and
fixes the problem.  He is recommended for a security clearance.  (Applicant’s Exhibit B.)
An  email  correspondence  from  a  government  customer  indicates  that  Applicant
has been a valuable asset to the program’s efforts.  (Applicant’s Exhibit D.)
Applicant  received  both  a  silver  award  on  December  10,  2018,  and  a  copper
award  on  October  27,  2017,  from  his  employer  for  going  above  and  beyond,  and  for
exemplary performance and team commitment in volunteering for overtime that kept the
programs on track.  (Applicant’s Exhibit B.)
Applicant has completed the requirements and received a Certificate, qualified as
a Certified IPC Specialist in Soldered Electrical and Electronic Assemblies, and qualified
as  a  Certified  IPC  Specialist  in  Acceptance  for  Cable  and  Wire  Harness  Assemblies.
(Applicant’s Exhibit B.)
