Financial Considerations
Applicant  attributed  her  financial  complications  to  a  failed  business,  periods  of
unemployment and underemployment, and unexpected medical issues without medical
insurance. In April 2014, Applicant opened a tanning salon business. She purchased the
tanning  equipment and  operated  the  business  out of  her  home.  Her  business  was  not
producing much income, and Applicant eventually closed the business in May 2016. She
was unemployed until November 2016, when she was hired by a temp agency. During
the period of her self-employment, she did not have medical insurance. Her boyfriend, at
the time, was paying the majority of her bills. After their relationship ended, Applicant’s
grandmother provided her with financial assistance. (Tr. 22-24, 47-52)
