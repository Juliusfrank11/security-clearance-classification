Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and the newly added SOR ¶ 1.d.3 He denied
SOR  ¶  1.b,  which  was  withdrawn.  His  admissions  and  explanations  are  incorporated
into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and
exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  52  years  old.  He  has  never  married,  but  he  has  a  fiancée,  who  is
also his cohabitant. He has a daughter, age 19, who is in college, and an adult son, age
25.  Applicant  has  a  high  school  diploma.  He  has  worked  for  his  employer,  a  defense
contractor, since 1990. He has held a security clearance for many years. (Tr. 12, 18-24,
1 Department Counsel called Applicant to confirm whether he had submitted post-hearing documents, but
never heard back from him. He does not have e-mail. (Hearing Exhibit III)
2 Tr. 18-25. Applicant did not object to the amendments. He admitted SOR ¶ 1.d. (Tr. 21) Because SOR ¶
1.d was added at the start of the hearing, I gave Applicant about seven weeks after the hearing to submit
responsive documents. (Tr. 118) He did not do so. (HE III)
3 In his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 1.a only in part. At the start of the hearing, he admitted it in full.

29, 46, 109, 110, 115; GE 1) Applicant works in State 1. He has lived for many years in
State 2, a neighboring state. (Tr. 112-113)
As to federal tax issues, Applicant disclosed on his September 2015 SCA that he
“failed  to  file  and  pay  federal  income  taxes  during  the  years  2007,  2008,  and  2009.  I
made payments and loss [sic] income returns.” He estimated that he had failed to pay
about $5,000 in federal income taxes. He also stated that the debt had been satisfied in
about May 2012. (GE 1 at 29)
As to state tax issues, Applicant stated on his SCA, “I do not know why I failed to
file/pay for the years listed 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014.” He
estimated  that  he  had  failed  to  pay  about  $15,000  in  state  income  taxes,  and  said  he
was “still making payments for the unpaid taxes.” (GE 1 at 30)
Applicant  had  background  interviews  on  January  23  and  26,  2018.  He
authenticated the interviewing agent’s summaries of those interviews in an Interrogatory
Response to DOHA in July 2018. (GE 2) Those interview summaries do not address the
issue of Applicant’s failure to timely file state and federal income tax returns. Applicant
also had an earlier interview, in July 2017, but the summary of that earlier interview is
not in evidence. (GE 2 at 6)
Applicant  stated  in  his  January  23,  2018  interview  summary  that  $300  of  his
monthly pay had been garnished to resolve his federal income tax debt. The start date
is not noted, but the garnishment ended in May 2012, when the IRS notified him that his
federal income tax debt was satisfied. (GE 2 at 6) This evidence provided the basis for
the Government’s withdrawal of SOR ¶ 1.b (which Applicant also denied in his Answer).
Applicant’s State 2 tax debt was initially being paid through a wage garnishment,
which began in 2015. (GE 3; Tr. 91, 98-100) In November 2017, the garnishment was
removed when Applicant contacted State 2 tax authorities and arranged to pay $382 a
month  through  his  bank  account  to  resolve  his  past-due  state  income  tax  debt,
estimated at about $15,000, for tax years 2007-2014.4 (Tr. 100, 114-115; GE 2 at 6, 7;
GE 3; AE A) He began those voluntary payments in January 2018. (Tr. 49)
A “Statement of Account” from State 2’s Department of Revenue shows that as
of  July  2018,  Applicant  owed  $8,465  in  State  2  taxes,  penalties,  and  interest,  for  tax
years  2013  and  2014.  (SOR  ¶  1.c)  He  had  paid  $2,934  towards  his  tax  debt  during
2018. The  July  2018  “Statement  of  Account”  does not  reference  any  earlier  tax  years.
(GE 4)
4 This $15,000 figure was erroneously alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b as what Applicant owed in past-due federal
tax debt. He disclosed on his SCA that he owed $5,000 in federal taxes, not $15,000, and in any event,
SOR ¶ 1.b was withdrawn, since that debt was paid in 2012.

Applicant provided a November 2018 bank statement showing that he continues
to  have  $382  withdrawn  each  month  towards  his  State  2  tax  debt.  (AE  A)  He  did  not
provide  documentation  from  State  2  of  an  updated  balance,  but  said  he  had  paid  an
additional $1,000 or $1,200 since July 2018, and had about $7,000 left to pay. (Tr. 50,
62, 70, 98)
As amended, the SOR alleges that for tax years 2007 to 2014, Applicant failed to
timely file his federal income tax returns (SOR ¶ 1.a) and state income tax returns (SOR
¶ 1.d), as required.
Applicant  testified  that  he  filed  his  state  and  federal  tax  returns  for  tax  years
2007, 2008, and 2009, “all three at the same time,” in 2010. (Tr. 52, 55-57, 64, 82, 86)
When asked why he filed his returns late, Applicant said he was told by an informal tax
advisor that “if I didn’t owe taxes I could file three years together.” He also said he heard
the person who told him this was later indicted. (Tr. 56) (Tr. 82-83) If Applicant filed all
three of these returns in April 2010, as he said, this would make his 2009 returns timely,
but his 2007 and 2008 returns late. (Tr. 59, 84)
While the record is rather unclear on this point, Applicant also testified that, either
for  those  years  (2007-2009),  or  perhaps  for  some  years  after  that  (2010-2013),  his
fiancée attempted to file their tax returns on their home computer, through a nationally
recognized tax preparation software program. (Tr. 51, 52, 55, 68) This “didn’t work out
altogether correct either. So that just put me deeper in the hole,” he testified. (Tr. 52) It
is unclear if this refers to calculation of taxes owed, or to tax filings as well.
Applicant  also  asserted  that,  since  he  worked  in  State  1,  his  employer  had  not
been  withholding  state  taxes  for  State  2,  where  he  lives.  (Tr.  52)  He  asserted  that  he
was  supposed  to  file  state  income  tax  returns  both  for  State  2,  where  he  lives,  and  a
“non-resident”  tax  return  for  State  1,  where  he  works.  (Tr.  52-54,  88,  113)5  He  also
attempted to claim his commuting expenses, because he has an interstate commute to
and from work every day. This was not successful, and he had to pay a penalty when
he filed his three years of returns, in 2010. (Tr. 56-57)
For  tax  years  2014  through  2016,  Applicant  hired  a  tax  preparation  firm  from
California (not Applicant’s home state) who he heard about on the radio. He paid them
$5,000. He said they assisted in preparing and filing his federal returns for those years,
but not his State 2 returns. By the time of his background interviews (2017 and 2018),
he  decided  to  contact  State  2  himself  to  resolve  his  state  tax  issues  (as  discussed
above). (Tr. 59-62, 69, 71, 84-94)
5  There  is  no  allegation  in  the  SOR  about  overdue  State  1  taxes  or  tax  returns,  nor  is  there  any  such
indication in the record. He also has never lived there.

In  his  Answer  to  SOR  ¶  1.a,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  “failed  to  timely  file  as
required federal income tax returns for the tax  years 2007, 2008, and 2009.” (Answer)
This comports with what he disclosed on his SCA. (GE 1 at 29) He did not address tax
years 2010 to 2014 in his Answer. At the start of the hearing, when this was brought to
his  attention,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶  1.a  in  full,  as  to  all  federal  tax  years  alleged.
(2007-2014) (Tr. 16, 51)
Later in the hearing, however,  when asked about the status of his filings for tax
years 2010-2014, Applicant testified, “[w]ell, I didn’t file on time for [State 2]. As far as
my federal taxes, I thought that I filed every one [of those years] on time, I honestly did.”
(Tr.  63;  see  also  Tr.  64)  Applicant  also  said  he  thought  he  filed  all  of  those  federal
returns on time “except for maybe one” year, tax year 2014. (Tr. 65)
Applicant acknowledged at hearing, both in answering SOR ¶ 1.d, and later, that
he filed his State 2 tax returns late, for tax years 2007 through 2014. (Tr. 21, 63, 66, 88,
91) This admission also comports with what he disclosed on his SCA. (GE 1 at 30) He
did not file an extension to the annual filing deadline. (Tr. 88)
Applicant testified that as of the date of the hearing, he had no federal or State 2
tax  returns  that  remained  unfiled,  including  tax  years  not  alleged  (2015,  2016,  and
2017). He stated that since 2014, his federal and State 2 tax returns had been filed on
time. (Tr. 66-67) He also testified that he owed no past-due federal taxes, and no past-
due State 2 income taxes beyond the $7,000 he still owes for tax years 2013 and 2014.
(Tr. 69)
With his July 2018 Interrogatory Response to DOHA, Applicant provided copies
of account transcripts from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years 2015-2017,
but not for any earlier tax year. He said he was only able to request those three years
by phone, and would have had to make a written request to the IRS for earlier account
transcripts. He did not do that. (Tr. 116)
Applicant  filed  his  2015  federal  tax  return  in  November  2016  (though  it  was
several months late). He filed his 2016 and 2017 federal tax returns on time. (GE 2)6 GE
2, then, largely supports Applicant’s testimony as to his more recent federal tax filings.
He was not asked to provide State 2 tax transcripts with the Interrogatory Response.
Applicant  recently  began  working  with  a  nationally  recognized  tax  preparation
service.  With  their  assistance,  he  filed  his  2017  state  and  federal  tax  returns  on  time.
(Tr. 67-68, 86; GE 2) His plan is to use them for his 2018 taxes, and in the future. (Tr.
108)
6  Applicant  submitted  federal  tax  transcripts  for  tax  years  2015,  2016,  and  2017  when  he  responded  to
DOHA’s  Interrogatory.  Those  returns  were  not  initially  submitted  as  part  of  GE  2,  but  were  offered  by
Department Counsel during the hearing when they came up during Applicant’s cross-examination. They
were then included as part of GE 2, and admitted without objection. (Tr. 71-81)

In 2015, Applicant earned about $69,000 in adjusted gross income; in 2016, he
earned  just  under  $71,000  in  adjusted  gross  income;  and  in  2017,  he  earned  over
$116,000 in adjusted gross income. (GE 2) He attributed this significant increase to an
extended  work  assignment  in  another  state  when  he  worked  a  lot  of  overtime.  His
current  income  level  is  between  $60,000  and  $64,000  annually,  before  overtime,  and
about  $80,000  including  overtime.  During  summer  2018,  Applicant  was  sidelined  for
several  months  with  an  injury,  so  he  earned  significantly  less  income  than  usual.  (Tr.
101-104)
Applicant  and  his  fiancée  live  in  a  home  that  she  owns.  He  makes  the  $520
monthly  house  payment.  He  has  a  $407  monthly  car  payment.  His  daughter  is  in
college, and he helps her financially when he can. With his other monthly expenses, he
has  limited  funds  left  over  at  the  end  of  the  month  and  essentially  lives  paycheck-to-
paycheck. He has about $70,000 in his 401k plan, and borrowed about $3,000 against it
for his recent medical expenses. His fiancée is on disability, and does not work. They try
to keep to a budget but he has not had formal credit counseling. (Tr. 94, 103-108, 111,
117)
Applicant  loves  his  country,  his  job,  his  children,  and  his  family.  He  spoke  with
appreciation of the mentoring he received from older employees when his career began
28 years ago, and seeks to be a mentor now for younger employees himself. He takes
great pride in the work he does for his country. He understands the need to “dot every ‘i’
and  cross  every  ‘t’”  both  at  work  and  otherwise,  and  he  recognizes  that  he  did not do
that  with  his  taxes.  He  is  sorry  for  his  actions  and  recognizes  that it  was  “something  I
brought on myself. But I’m trying to work through it.” (Tr. 27-29, 70, 127-128)
