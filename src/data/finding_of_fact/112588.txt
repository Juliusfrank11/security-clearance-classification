Applicant  admitted  the  sole  SOR  allegation  under  Guideline  H.  In  his  SOR
answer he noted that he disclosed his marijuana use in his 2017 SCA, and that his use
of  marijuana  was  legal  in  his  state  of  residence.  He  promised  to  discontinue  using
marijuana if required for his job or clearance eligibility. His admission is incorporated as
a  finding  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  review  of  the  record  evidence,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  30-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  graduated  from
high  school  in  2006,  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2010,  and  received  a  doctorate
degree (Ph.D.) from a prestigious U.S. university in 2017. He is engaged to be married.
He has no children.
Between  2010  and  2016,  Applicant  worked  as  a  research  assistant  at  the
university  where  he  earned  his  doctorate  degree.  His  current  employer  and  clearance
sponsor, a federal contactor, hired him in 2016, and he has worked there ever since. In
his response to Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of his May 2017 SCA,
Applicant disclosed that he illegally used marijuana between June 2005 and April 2017.
He stated that had not participated in substance-abuse counseling.
During his December 2017 background interview with a government investigator,
Applicant  confirmed  that  he  illegally  used  marijuana  about  weekly  during  social
occasions,  and  for  pain  management  for  sports-related  injuries,  between  2005  and
December  2017.  He  noted  that  his  fiancée,  siblings,  and  friends  were  aware  of  his
marijuana  use.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  was  not  marijuana  dependent.  He
promised  to  stop  using  marijuana  if  required  for  his  job  or  clearance  eligibility.  In  his
response  to  DOHA  interrogatories,  Applicant  stated  that  his  most  recent  use  of
marijuana occurred on May 26, 2018.
