In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR 1.a and 3.b. He denied the
remaining SOR allegations.  Applicant  is 63 years old.  He married in  1978,  divorced  in
2006, remarried in 2010, and divorced in 2012. He has three adult children. Two serve
in the U.S. military and the third is a state trooper. (Response to the SOR; Tr. at 8, 49-
51, 57, 63, 67, 83-85, 158-160; GE 1, 2, 3, 4).
Applicant  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  from  the  U.S.  Military  Academy  at  West
Point  (West  Point)  in  1978  and  two  master’s  degrees,  in  1985  and  1991.  He  was
commissioned  as  an  infantry  officer  and  served  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  1978  to  1985,
when he was honorably discharged. He has since worked for various DOD contractors.
As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  he  worked  as  a  consultant  for  a  DOD  contractor  since
October 2018. He was first granted a DOD security clearance in 1974. (Tr. at 5-6, 51-
57, 158-160; GE 1, 2, 3, 4; AE A).
In  1998,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  under  the  influence
(DUI)  (SOR  1.a,  3.a).  This  was  his  first  and  only  alcohol-related  incident.  He  was
separated from his first wife. He was at a restaurant with coworkers and he consumed
six  12-  to  16-ounce  beers  over  the  course  of  approximately  four  hours.  He  felt
intoxicated.  He  wrecked  his  car  as  he  drove  home,  after  overcorrecting  in  an  effort  to
avoid a deer. The police took him into custody and cited him for DUI. He was sentenced
to probation before judgment; his driver’s license was suspended for approximately 90
days; he was fined; and he was ordered to make a donation to Mothers Against Drunk
Driving. (Tr. at 62-66; GE 2, 3; AE D).
Applicant  has  not  had  any  subsequent  alcohol-related  arrests  or  charges.  He
denied consuming alcohol to the point of intoxication and driving under the influence of
alcohol  and  while  intoxicated  on  numerous  occasions  between  2005  and  2015  (SOR
1.b,  1.c,  3.a).  He  denied  the  following  information  reflected  in  a  May  2015  report  of
polygraph  examination  that:  (1)  he  stopped  consuming  alcohol  after  his  2010  heart
attack;  (2)  from  November  2013  to  November  2014,  he  consumed  four  vodka  tonics,
totaling one pint of vodka, over the course of an evening four to five nights weekly, and
he drank until he felt intoxicated and then fell asleep three to four nights weekly; (3) he
had most recently  operated a vehicle under the influence of alcohol in February 2014,
after attending a poker game with friends and consuming three to four two-ounce shots
of bourbon over a four-hour period, and he would have likely been cited with DUI if he
had  been  stopped  by  police  on  this  occasion;  (4)  his  girlfriend  in  November  2014
expressed concern about the amount of his alcohol consumption; and (5) in his lifetime,
he had driven “a few dozen times” while feeling intoxicated but was undetected. (Tr. at
66-70, 112-124, 160; GE 2; AE D).
Applicant testified that he was either misinterpreted or he misspoke in May 2015.
He testified that he continued to consume red wine in moderation after his heart attack.
He acknowledged potentially consuming a pint of vodka over the course of a week from
November 2013 to November 2014; he could not explain how he may have misspoken
about  drinking  until  he  felt  intoxicated  then  falling  asleep  three  to  four  nights  weekly
during that period. He testified that his reference to the February 2014 occurrence was
to a friend in the poker group who had consumed bourbon and “was slurring his words”
when  the  friend  telephoned  him  to  notify  him  of  a  roadside  sobriety  checkpoint.  He
testified that he meant to state that he typically consumed a few drinks of red wine over
the course of approximately six hours at periodic poker games with friends. He testified
that his girlfriend did not express concern over the amount of his alcohol consumption in
November 2014. (Tr. at 66-70, 112-124, 160; GE 2; AE D).
Applicant acknowledged that as a single man, from approximately 2006 to 2010
and since 2012, he has belonged to a social activities group for adults whose principal
event  consisted  of  weekly  beach  volleyball,  where  he  would  consume  a  beer  or  two
over  the  course  of  a  three-  to  four-hour  evening  game  before  driving  home.  From
January to June 2015, he testified that he consumed around three to four vodka tonics
or  red  wine  nightly  to  treat  his  hip  pain,  as  further  discussed  below,  but  he  did  not
consider himself intoxicated on these occasions. Since his hip surgery in June 2015, he
testified  that  he  consumes  two  drinks  a  night,  two  nights  a  week.  From  mid-2015  to
February  2017,  he  testified  that  he  consumed  a  drink  or  two  socially  with  friends.  He
testified  that  he  was  careful  not  to  consume  alcohol  when  he  took  Oxycodone,  as
further discussed below, because doing so “is an instant prescription for falling asleep”
and “you’re a danger to everybody” if you drink, take Oxycodone, and drive. (Tr. at 66-
70, 112-124, 135-140, 160; GE 2; AE D).
Applicant denied that he knowingly circumvented appropriate methods to obtain
his  prescription  heart  medication,  Crestor,  twice--in  2013  and  in  2014  (SOR  3.c).
Though he had health insurance, his deductible was $700, which he could not afford on
his limited income as a consultant at the time. He testified that he informed his doctor of
such  to  no  avail.  He  testified  that  he  discussed  his  situation  with  his  sister  and  she
offered to send him her Crestor pills. On both occasions, she sent him a 30-day supply.
He believed she had a prescription for Crestor, but he could not recall whether she, in
fact,  did  or  if  she  obtained  a  prescription  for  him.  He  testified  that  she  paid  a  nominal
amount, sent him her medication, and he sent her a check for $65 to $75. He testified
that he did not think it was a big deal at the time. He does not anticipate this becoming a
problem in the future since the generic Crestor is now more affordable and he would be
eligible  to  qualify  for  Medicare.  He  also  testified  that  he  would  utilize  other
methodologies, such as declare himself indigent, go to the emergency room, or obtain
doctor  samples,  if  necessary.  He  signed  a  statement  of  intent  to  not  use  any  illegal
substance or abuse prescription drugs in the future, and that violation would result in the
revocation of his clearance. (Tr. at 85-90, 143-147, 174-175; GE 2; AE E).
Applicant  denied  using  marijuana  in  December  2014,  and  he  denied  that  this
alleged  use  of  marijuana  occurred  after  he  was  granted  a  security  clearance  in
September  2005  (SOR  2.a,  2.d,  3.a).  A  December  2015  report  of  polygraph
examination reflects:
During pretest interview, [Applicant] reported that in December 2014, while
tailgating  at  the  Army  vs.  Navy  football  game  at  M&T  Bank  Stadium  in
Baltimore, MD, [Applicant] smoked marijuana. [Applicant] took a “hit” off of
a  marijuana  joint  that  [Applicant’s]  friend  passed  around.  [Applicant]  did
not purchase the marijuana or contribute money towards the purchase of
the marijuana. [Applicant] was aware of the policy regarding no illegal drug
involvement while holding a security clearance, but at the time, [Applicant]
thought “why not?” [Applicant] initially did not report this incident during his
previous  polygraph  on  06  May  2015  because  he  was  embarrassed  and
believed it was a one[-]time event.
Applicant  denied  that  the  marijuana  was  passed  around,  testifying  that  it  was  just
passed to him from his friend. He testified that he could not recall using the word “hit,”
but  stated  “I  think  I  used  the  word  drag.  .  .  .”  (Tr.  at  70-73,  81-83,  109-110,  125-132,
147-155, 160-162, 167-177; GE 2; AE D).
Applicant also denied saying that he did not report his December 2014 marijuana
use during his May 2015 interview with the AGA (SOR 3.f) due to “embarrassment.” He
testified, “I can’t imagine that because I’m sure it came up . . . .” Rather, he testified that
he did not disclose it in May 2015 because he did not consider it a “use” of marijuana,
and he chose to volunteer the incident in December 2015. He continued:
Certainly  not  because  of any  embarrassment,  although  I  will freely  admit
that it was not my finest hour. But I do believe that it was, in fact, a one-
time event – and it was actually a one-time non-event.
He  denied  saying  that  he  chose  to  disregard  the  policy  against  illegal  drug  use  while
holding a clearance. He testified, “I would never say something like ‘why not.’ That’s just
not  in  my  DNA  to  even  respond  to  him.”  (Tr.  at  70-73,  81-83,  109-110,  125-132,  147-
155, 160-162, 167-177; GE 2; AE D).
Applicant described the December 2014 marijuana incident as follows: he and a
group  of  40  other  individuals,  to  include  some  of  his  West  Point  classmates,  took  a
three- to four-hour bus ride to a football game. His hips “stiffened up quite dramatically”
during the ride, but they were not “horrible, they were just stiff and very uncomfortable.”
While tailgating, his friend, who had a medical marijuana card, offered him marijuana to
provide relief for his hips. He “stupidly . . . went to try it” and concurrently with doing so,
thought it was a bad idea. He testified:
I  pulled  the  smoke  into  my  mouth  and  .  .  .  it  was  just  so  incredibly
disgusting that I spit it out and had to rinse my mouth out, it was absolutely
off-the-chart disgusting . . . .
He  acknowledged  that  he  took  a  “puff”  of  the  marijuana  cigarette,  but  insisted  that  he
did not inhale or ingest it, he did not experience any effect from it, and he did not believe
it  rose  to  the  level  of  “use.”  He  testified  that  he  “ran  up  to  the  line  and  leaned  over  it,
perhaps, but . . . I do not think I crossed that line.” He signed a statement of intent to not
use  any  illegal  substance  or  abuse  prescription  drugs  in  the  future,  and  that  violation
would result in the revocation of his clearance. (Tr. at 70-73, 81-83, 109-110, 125-132,
147-155, 160-162, 167-177; GE 2; AE D, E).
Applicant  denied misusing  the  prescription medication  Xanax  in  February  2015.
He  also  denied  misusing  the  prescription  medication  Xanax  after  he  was  granted  a
security  clearance  in  September  2005  (SOR  2.b,  2.d,  3.a).  He  testified  that  he  went
through  a  “manic  depressive”  period  during  the  military  deployments  of  two  of  his
children, the first deployment of which occurred in 2004. He described himself as:
I couldn’t relax. I . . . would stand up and then just start pacing. And, or I
was just like, I wouldn’t say lethargic, but . . . I found just found it hard to
care about things. . . . I was crazed. . . . I was freaked out.
He testified that in February 2015, his then live-in girlfriend suggested that he take one
of her prescription Xanax. He testified that he used one quarter of one pill. Within three
or  four  days,  he  testified  that  he  had  an  appointment  with  his  primary  care  physician,
who  prescribed  him  Xanax.  Though  he  felt  the  angst  related  to  his  children’s
deployments for a number of years prior to 2015, he had not previously been prescribed
Xanax. He used his prescribed Xanax for approximately three weeks and “it settled me.”
(Tr. at 51, 73-77, 79-83, 110-111, 132-135, 147-155, 162-171; GE 2; AE D).
Applicant testified that he did not believe he misused his then girlfriend’s Xanax
because he “used it in the manner that it was supposed to be used,” and he obtained a
prescription of his own shortly after. He testified that it did not occur to him that such use
was  illegal,  though  in  hindsight  he  saw  that  it  was.  He  testified  that  in  the  future,  he
would  go  to  the  emergency  room  rather  than  use  another  individual’s  prescription.  He
signed a statement of intent to not use any illegal substance or abuse prescription drugs
in the future, and that violation would result in the revocation of his clearance. (Tr. at 51,
73-77, 79-83, 110-111, 132-135, 147-155, 162-171; AE E).
Applicant  denied  misusing  the  prescription  medication  Oxycodone  in  December
2015.  He  also  denied  misusing  the  prescription  medication  Oxycodone  after  he  was
granted  a  security  clearance  in  September  2005  (SOR  2.c,  2.d,  3.a).  He  cited  to  a
series of health problems that started when he experienced a sudden cardiac arrest in
June  2010.  In  December  2010,  he  then  had  a  quintuple  bypass  surgery,  and  his
recovery period lasted for approximately one year. In January 2015, he was diagnosed
with  degenerative  problems  in  both  of  his  hips,  requiring  bilateral  hip  replacement
surgery.  He  underwent  the  first  of  two  surgeries  in  June  2015,  and  the  second  in  late
2015. He required an assistive walker, crutches, or a cane to walk, through March 2017.
(Tr. at 57-62, 77-83, 110-111, 135-142, 162-167; GE 2; AE D).
Applicant was first prescribed Oxycodone by his doctor after his first hip surgery
in  June  2015.  He  took  Oxycodone  daily,  as  prescribed,  from  June  2015  through
February  2017.  As  discussed  above,  though  he  consumed  an  alcoholic  drink  socially
from mid-2015 to February 2017, he testified that he did not do so on the days he took
Oxycodone. He testified, “[y]ou’d have good days and you’d have bad days . . . the pain
was, sometimes, absolutely extraordinary and, sometimes, it was not bad.”  He testified
that his prescription for Oxycodone varied:
Sometimes they would be for . . . ten 325s, sometimes for 20 325s. And,
and  when  I  say  20,  it’s  20  milligrams  of  oxycodone,  combined  with  325
milligrams of Motrin. Or, sometimes, 2,500 of Motrin and, sometimes, just
like 20 milligrams of oxycodone with no Motrin. So it was all, it was, kind
of, a mixed bag and it, you know, it was, you never knew what you were
going to get.
He never had more than a month’s supply at a given time, so he had to obtain a refill at
least  monthly.  To  do  so,  he  had  to  go  through  his  doctor’s  assistant,  a  nurse
practitioner,  to  obtain  a  signed  prescription.  (Tr.  at  57-62,  77-83,  110-111,  135-142,
162-167; GE 2; AE D).
In December 2015, Applicant was in severe pain. He testified that he was unable
to  obtain  a  refill  for  his  then  existing  Oxycodone  prescription  because  the  nurse
practitioner  was  on  vacation,  and  neither  his  doctor  nor any  of  the  administrative  staff
returned his calls. His sister, who resided in a different state, offered to overnight him a
bottle  of  her prescription  Oxycodone,  consisting  of  “twenty  pills  of  each  pill having  ten
milligrams of oxycodone and 325 milligrams of Motrin . . . .” He testified that “it got me
over the hump. It was a gap fill, until such time, as I could get another . . . refill,” which
occurred  approximately  less  than  a  week  later.  (Tr.  at  77-83,  110-111,  123-125,  135-
142, 144, 162-167; GE 2; AE D).
As with Applicant’s use of his then girlfriend’s Xanax in 2015, he testified that he
did  not  believe  his  use  of  his  sister’s  prescription  Oxycodone  constituted  misuse.  He
stated:
[Y]ou  could  say  that  my  .  .  .  method  of  acquisition  might  not  have  been
exactly  right,  and  I,  probably  could’ve  done  that  better,  but  in  the  grand
scheme of things, I was using it for the purpose that it was intended.
(Tr. at 77-83, 110-111, 123-125, 135-142, 144, 162-167; AE D, E).
Applicant testified that he did not realize then that he was doing anything wrong.
He  testified  that  he  has  since  learned  that  he  is  not  to  use  another  individual’s
prescription, and that in the future, he would go to the emergency room to obtain a new
prescription. As of the date of the hearing, Applicant testified that  the only medications
he  was  taking  were  for  blood  pressure,  cholesterol,  and  blood  thinner.  He  signed  a
statement  of  intent  to not  use  any  illegal substance  or abuse prescription  drugs  in  the
future,  and  that  violation  would  result  in  the  revocation  of  his  clearance.  (Tr.  at  77-83,
110-111, 123-125, 135-142, 144, 162-167; AE D, E).
Applicant  maintained  that  at  the  time  of  the  marijuana  incident  in  December
2014, his use of his then girlfriend’s Xanax in February 2015, and his use of his sister’s
Oxycodone in December 2015, he was eligible for a security clearance but he did not, in
fact, have one. He testified that he understood that his clearance was inactive because
he had been previously read off all classified programs and was not read back on until
around  2016.  When  confronted  with  the  AGA’s  October  2016  clearance  decision
statement,  which  reflects  that  he  had  “been  in  SCI  access”  with  the  AGA  since
September 2005, and he was granted eligibility for access to SCI by the U.S. military in
December 2010, he responded that any information reflecting that he was in continuous
access  was  “news  to  me.”  He  also  testified  that  his  interviews  became  “somewhat
contentious,”  and  he  did  not  have  an  opportunity  to  appeal  the  eventual  unfavorable
2016 AGA decision because he did not receive the appeal documents in the mail before
the  appeal  period  lapsed.  (Tr.  at  70-73,  81-83,  109-110,  125-132,  147-155,  160-162,
167-177; GE 1, 2).
Two of Applicant’s character witnesses, as further discussed below, testified that
they believed Applicant had a security clearance in December 2014. One witness was
Applicant’s  supervisor  from  October  2018  to  the  date  of  the  hearing.  This  witness
testified that he assisted Applicant with obtaining employment in October 2014 with the
DOD  contractor  for  whom  Applicant  worked  until  October  2018,  and  he  believed
Applicant’s work there required a clearance from its inception. A second witness worked
for  the  same  employer  as  Applicant  in  2014,  but  in  a  different  sector.  This  witness
testified  that  he  was  told  that  Applicant  had  “a  Top  Secret  SCI  clearance  and  he  was
over  in  the  cyber-division  for  two  years  --  2014  and  2015  --  as  a  senior  capture
manager.” (Tr. at 178-204; AE A, C).
Since Applicant did not believe he used marijuana in 2014 or misused Xanax in
2015,  he  testified  that  he  did  not  falsify  his  responses  to  sections  23a  and  23b  of  his
March  2015  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  or  section  23  of  his November 2015
SCA (SOR 3.d, 3.e, 3.g, 3.h, 3.i). He testified that he did not falsify information during a
May  2015  interview  with  the  AGA,  when  he  failed  to  disclose  his  2014  marijuana  use
(SOR  3.f).  He  also  testified  that  he  did  not  falsify  his  response  to  section  23  of  his
August  2017  SCA  since  he  did  not  believe  his  misused  either  Xanax  or  Oxycodone
(SOR 3.k). Sections 23a and 23b of his March 2015 SCA  inquired, respectively, about
the illegal use of controlled substances, to include prescription drugs, in the seven years
prior  to  the  date  of  the  SCA,  and  any  illegal  use  of  a  controlled  substance  while
possessing a security clearance. Section 23 of his November 2015 SCA inquired about
illegal drug use or drug activity, to include the intentional misuse of prescription drugs, in
the seven years prior to the date of the SCA, and any illegal use or other involvement
with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance. Section 23 of
his August 2017 SCA inquired about the intentional misuse of prescription drugs in the
seven  years prior to  the  date  of  the SCA.     (Tr. at  90-99, 108-111,  147-155.  167-171;
GE 1, 2, 3).
Applicant,  however,  listed  his  December  2014  marijuana  use  in  response  to
section 23 of his August 2017 SCA, which inquired whether he had illegally used a drug
or  controlled  substance  in  the  seven  years  prior  to  the  date  of  the  SCA.  He  marked
“Yes,” listed “THC (Such as marijuana, weed, pot, hashish, etc.)” and explained:
I was at a tailgate for the Army-Navy Game on Dec 13th, 2014 and with a
bunch  of  friends  in  the  parking  lot;  a  friend  was  smoking  a  joint  and
passed it to me. I took one puff. This was the only instance. . . . One puff,
one time. I am completely at a loss to explain why.
When asked whether he intended or not to use marijuana in the future, he noted, “No,
this  was  a  stupid,  mindless  aberration.”  He  provided  no  commentary  that  he  did  not
inhale or ingest the marijuana, that he did not experience any effect from it, or that he
did not believe it rose to the level of “use.” (Tr. at 70-73, 81-83, 109-110, 125-132, 147-
155, 160-162, 167-177; GE 1, 2).
Applicant  denied  that  he  stated  during  an  interview  with  the  AGA  in  December
2015  that  he  intended  to  violate  a  state’s handgun  registration  laws  by  not  registering
his handguns, as required. He testified that he intended to state that he simply had not
gotten around to doing so. He testified that he prioritized his work and health issues at
the time, but he had no intent to keep unregistered guns. He testified that he complied
with the registration laws in November 2016 and registered his one handgun, as he had
given his second one to his son who is a state trooper. (SOR 3.j). (Tr. at 101-108, 155-
158; GE 2)
In August 2009, Applicant paid a prostitute for sex. He testified that this was the
only  instance  he  did  so.  He  was  single.  His  friend  suggested  it  after  Applicant  was
lamenting  about  his  dating  life.  He  testified  that  he  was  stupid  and  unaware  of  the
ramifications  of  his actions,  though  he  knew  his  conduct  was  illegal.  He  has  no  future
intentions of repeating such conduct. (SOR 3.b). (Tr. at 83-85, 142-143; GE 2).
Applicant’s witnesses described him as generous, trustworthy, reliable, and loyal.
They each testified that they reviewed the SOR. Two witnesses referred to Applicant as
a lifelong friend, having known him since their simultaneous attendance at West Point in
the 1970s. Both indicated that they have seen Applicant at least once monthly over the
past  10  years.  One  indicated  that  he  was  surprised  about  the  accuracy  of  the  SOR,
given  his  interactions  with  Applicant.  The  other  indicated  that  he  had  never  observed
Applicant consume alcohol to excess, use marijuana, or misuse prescription drugs. This
witness  testified  that  he  was  unaware  of  Applicant’s  1998  DUI  and  alleged  2014
marijuana use until he saw the SOR, and that he organized the group of 40 to 50 people
that  attended  the  football  game  in  December  2014,  where  Applicant  allegedly  used
marijuana.  This  witness  testified  that  he  held  a  security  clearance  his  entire  adult  life,
and  he  knew  that  illegal  drug  use  and  the  misuse  of  prescription  drugs  was  not
permitted while holding a clearance. If the SOR allegations were proven to be accurate,
he believed they were situational and not reflective of Applicant’s overall character. (Tr.
at 25-48, 178-204; AE B, C).
The  third  witness,  as  previously  discussed,  consisted  of  the  individual who  was
Applicant’s  supervisor  from  October  2018  to  the  date  of  the  hearing.  The  witness
referred to Applicant as his best friend, having known him since 1996. Applicant has, at
various  times  since  2006,  worked  for  this  witness.  In  addition  to  testifying  that
Applicant’s position with the employer for whom Applicant worked from October 2014 to
October  2018  required  a  clearance  from  its  inception,  the  witness  also  testified  that
Applicant’s  position  in  2013  when  Applicant  worked  for  the  witness  as  a  consultant
required  a  clearance.  He  described  Applicant’s  work  performance  as  impeccable.  He
testified that he socialized with Applicant at monthly poker games,  where he observed
Applicant consume alcohol responsibly. He indicated that he did not observe Applicant
misuse prescription drugs or use illegal substances. (Tr. at 178-193; AE A, C).
The fourth witness also referred to Applicant as a lifelong friend, having first met
him  when  they  were  coworkers  from  1997  through  2006.  From  2006  to  2014,  the
witness and Applicant kept in touch through an occasional email. In 2014, as previously
discussed, when Applicant and the witness once again worked for the same employer
but  in  different  sectors,  the  witness  testified  that  he  was  told  that  Applicant  had  a
clearance  in  2014  and  2015.  The  witness  then  served  as  Applicant’s  supervisor  from
2016  to  2018.  He  stated  that  Applicant’s  performance  was  exceptional.  He  described
Applicant as a responsible drinker. He indicated that he was unaware that Applicant had
allegedly  used  any  illegal  substance  until  he  reviewed  the  SOR.  He  testified  that
Applicant told him that he took “a puff of marijuana, but was sickened by it immediately,
and blew it out” in December 2014 at a football game. (Tr. at 193-204; AE C).
