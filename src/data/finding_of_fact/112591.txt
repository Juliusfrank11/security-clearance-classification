Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer for about four months. He is married for the second time. He has a
child from his first marriage. He and his current wife have four children.1
Applicant  was  born  in  Iraq.  His  family moved  to  Kuwait  when  he  was  young  for
greater  opportunities.  Applicant  was  educated,  including  attendance  at  law  school,  in
Kuwait.  He  was  unable  to  complete  his  education,  and  his  father  was  imprisoned  in
1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait. His father was discriminated against because he was of
Iraqi origins. The family moved back to Iraq in 1993. Applicant was unable to complete
his education in Iraq because of the circumstances in that country.2
Applicant  volunteered  to  work  for  the  U.S.  military  in  2003.  He  worked  under
dangerous  conditions  in  Iraq  as  a  linguist  for  the  U.S.  military,  coalition  forces,  and
civilian government and reconstruction teams from 2003 to 2009. Because of that work,
he was eligible for a special immigrant visa. He immigrated to the United States in 2009.
His wife and children did not immigrate with him. He became a U.S. citizen in 2015.3
Applicant’s  father  is  deceased.  Applicant’s  wife,  five  children,  mother,  seven
siblings, in-laws, and extended family members are citizens and residents of Iraq. None
of his family have visited him in the United States. With the exception of his siblings who
are  teachers,  to  his  knowledge,  none  of  his  family  members  have  any  current
connection to the Iraqi government or any terrorist organization.4
Applicant  has  been  unable  to  bring  his  wife  and  their  children  to  the  United
States  because  of  financial  reasons.  He  will  work  in  Iraq  as  a  linguist  if  he  obtains  a
security  clearance.  He  hopes  to  use  the  extra  pay  he  will  receive  to  finance  their
immigration to the United States. He credibly testified that his family in Iraq could not be
used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information.5
