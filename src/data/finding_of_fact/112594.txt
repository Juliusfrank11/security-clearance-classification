Applicant  is  a  41-year-old  employee  of  a  DOD  contractor  seeking  a  security
clearance.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  since  October  2010.  His  highest
level of  education  is a  high  school diploma. He  is divorced  and  has  a  16-year-old  son
who lives with him. (Item 3)
On  March  21,  2017,  Applicant  submitted  an  Electronic  Questionnaire  for
Investigations  Processing.  (Item  3)  A  subsequent  background  investigation  revealed
Applicant had the following issues under the financial considerations concern: a Chapter
13  bankruptcy  filed  in  August  2017,  claiming  approximately  $63,500  in  outstanding
liabilities (SOR ¶ 1.a: Item 4, Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 2); a $17,819 state tax lien entered
against  Applicant  in  2011  (SOR  ¶  1.b:  Item  7  at  2),  a  $1,326  state  tax  lien  entered
against  Applicant  in  2012  (SOR  ¶  1.c:  Item 7  at  2);  a  $15,118 federal  tax  lien  entered
against Applicant in 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.d: Item 7 at 3); a $3,912 judgment owed to a state
entered against Applicant in 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.e: Item 5); Applicant failed to timely file his
federal income tax returns from 2010 to 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.f:  Item 8); and Applicant failed
to timely file his state income tax return for tax year 2013. (SOR ¶ 1.g). In his response
to the SOR, Applicant admits to all of the allegations. (Item 2)
Applicant encountered tax issues  when he  changed his W4 deductions  in order
to  increase  the  size  of  his  paycheck  because  he  and  his  then  wife  wanted  to  pay  off
some debts so they could purchase a house. His wife was unfaithful and they divorced
in 2008. A long custody battle for their son ensued. Applicant was also laid off between
May  2009  and  April  2010.  (Item  3,  section  13A;  Item  8  at  5;  Response  to  Form)
Applicant failed  to file  tax  returns or pay  taxes from 2010 to  2015.  He failed  to file tax
returns for those years because he was afraid to learn how much he owed in taxes. He
estimates he filed  tax returns for 2009 to 2011 a few years ago. He filed returns for tax
years  2012  to  2014  on  March  17,  2017.  Applicant  did  not  provide  a  copy  of  his  tax
returns. He estimates that he owes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) a total amount of
$20,000.  He  did  not  provide  any  statements  from  the  IRS,  such  as  tax  transcripts
indicating the total amount owed to include tax and penalties. (Item 8 at 5)
Internal Revenue Service Publication 908, Bankruptcy Tax Guide (IRS Pub 908)
states  that  the  Bankruptcy  Code  requires  Chapter  13  debtors  to  file  all  required  tax
returns  for  tax  periods  ending  within  four  years  of  the  debtor’s  bankruptcy  filing.  All
federal tax returns must be filed before the date set for the first meeting of creditors. IRS
Pub  908  also  states  that  the  Bankruptcy  Code  requires  debtors  to  file  tax  returns  that
become due after commencement of the bankruptcy or obtain an extension for filing a
return  before  the  due  date.  If  the  debtor  does  not  timely  file  federal  tax  returns,  the
bankruptcy court must dismiss or convert the case to another chapter of the Bankruptcy
Code.  Considering that the Bankruptcy Court approved Applicant’s payment plan, it is
likely he filed his federal tax returns.
On August 25, 2017, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13.  He listed
total  assets  of  $34,200  and  total  liabilities  of  $62,529.  Of  that  amount,  approximately
$20,997  consisted  of  taxes  and  other  debts  Applicant  owed  the  government.  (Item  4)
During  the  bankruptcy  proceedings,  a  state  department  of  labor  obtained  a  $3,912
judgment  against  Applicant  for  receiving  unemployment  benefits  between  June  19,
2010,  and  July  24,  2010,  when  he  was  actually  employed  during  that  period.  The
Bankruptcy Court adjudged this debt as nondischargeable. (SOR ¶ 1.e; Item 5)
The  Bankruptcy  Court  approved  a  five-year  repayment  plan  where  Applicant
makes monthly payments of $364.62 per pay period. The payment is deducted from his
pay check. Applicant provided copies of his earnings statement from August 25, 2017,
to  September  27,  2018,  which  indicates  that  he  is  making  payments  towards  his
Chapter  13  plan  on  a  regular  basis.  (Response  to  FORM)  Applicant  did  not  provide  a
complete copy of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy, to include his Chapter 13 repayment plan.
As such, there is no information about which creditors are being paid under the Chapter
13 repayment plan.
Applicant  states  that  he  filed  bankruptcy  in  order  to  stop  the  penalties  and  late
payment fees that were building up because of his poor choices when he was younger.
He  wants  to  be  responsible  for  his  debts.  (Response  to  FORM)    In  his  answer  to  the
SOR,  Applicant  provided  a  copy  of  a  Satisfaction  of  Judgment  regarding  the  $17,819
state tax judgment alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. (Item 2 at 4)  SOR ¶ 1.b is found for Applicant.
The  status  of  the  $1,326  state  tax  lien  (SOR  ¶  1.c)  entered  against  Applicant  in  2012
remains uncertain.  Applicant did not discuss or provide evidence that he filed his state
income return for tax year 2013. (SOR ¶ g)
Applicant admits he made many mistakes with his finances, but now believes he
is on the correct path and is making sound financial decisions. He currently pays all of
his bills on time. He is planning for his son’s future, who is now a junior in high school.
He takes pride in his work and would love the opportunity to apply his skill set to a new
program that requires a security clearance. (Response to FORM)
