Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in his declaration attached to his answer.
His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. (Answer, Tab D)
Applicant  is  48  years  old.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  defense
contractor,  since  2011.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  2010.  He  works  as  a
security officer for a government agency. He has a high school diploma and earned an
information  technology  (IT)  degree  in  1998.  He  is  divorced,  having  been  married  from
1999  to  2006.  He  has  one  son  who  is  18  and  who  Applicant  still  supports  financially.
Applicant served on active duty in the Army from 1990 to 1993 when he was honorably
discharged. He served in the Army Reserve and National Guard from 1993 to 2003. He
was honorably discharged after this service as well. (Tr. 17, 22-24; Answer, Tabs C-D)
The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file federal and state income tax
returns from 2010 to 2017. He admitted in his security clearance application (SCA), his
security  clearance  interview,  his  response  to  interrogatories,  his SOR  answer,  and  his
hearing testimony not timely filing his federal and state tax returns for those years. (Tr.
17; GE 1-2; Answer, Tab D
Applicant attributed his tax problems to two factors. First, he blames his divorce
in  2006,  which  resulted  in  a  joint-custody  arrangement  for  his  son.  Second,  he  claims
that  his  work schedule  changed  significantly in  2011  when  he  took  his current  job.  He
was required to work 12-hour shifts at times and travel to duty locations on short notice.
He  stated  that  between  his  job  demands  and  taking  care  of  his child, filing  his federal
and state income tax returns was not a priority for him. When he completed his SCA in
May 2016, he admitted not filing his state tax returns since 2010. He stated in the SCA
that he would file his returns “this year.” He did not file his returns in 2016. In September
and  December  2017,  he  was  interviewed  by  a  defense  investigator  during  his
background check. He admitted that he had yet to file his federal and state tax returns.
He testified that he realized his not filing tax returns was a serious issue. Applicant hired
a CPA to prepare his tax returns and shortly thereafter filed his 2010-2017 federal and
state tax returns in June 2018, four months before his SOR was issued. He documented
that he filed his 2018 federal tax return before its due date. There is no documentation
to support that he filed his 2016 federal return or his 2018 state return.  (Tr. 18-20, 29-
31, 32-38; Answer, Tab D; GE 1-2; AE A-C)
Applicant documented that he uses a budget and that his finances are in order.
He  has  not  received  financial  counseling.  For  all  the  years  he  did  not  file  federal  and
state tax returns he only owed one year of federal taxes, which he has since paid. He
presented  sworn  declarations  from  a  work  supervisor,  a  coworker,  and  a  personal
friend.  All  stated  that Applicant  is trustworthy,  reliable,  and  possesses  good  judgment.
They recommend he retain his security clearance. (Tr. 19-21, 25; Answer, Tabs D-G)
