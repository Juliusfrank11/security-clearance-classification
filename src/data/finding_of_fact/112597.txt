Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  The  admissions  are  adopted  as
findings  of  fact.  After  a  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  40  years  old.  She  has  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  since
November  2016.  Previously,  she  worked  for  federal  contractors  from  August  2015  to
March  2016  and  from  2005  to  May  2014.  She  experienced  periods  of  unemployment
from March 2016 to November 2016 and from May 2014 to August 2015. She is single,
never married, and has no children. The record is silent concerning her education level.1
The SOR alleged Applicant’s failure to timely file her 2012 through 2016 federal
tax  returns  and  her  2013  through  2015  state  tax  returns.  It  also  alleged  she  owed
approximately $7,950 for unpaid federal taxes for years 2012 through 2014. Finally, the
SOR alleged Applicant owed an unpaid medical debt in the amount of $250. Applicant
admitted in her February 2016 security clearance application (SCA) and her statement
to  a  defense  investigator  in  May  2017  that  she  failed  to  file  her  2012  through  2016
federal returns. She admitted in her SCA that she failed to file her 2013 through 2015
state returns. She also admitted owing back federal taxes. Credit reports document the
delinquent medical debt.2
Applicant  explained  that  she  began  experiencing  financial  difficulties  in  2012
when her roommate lost her job and Applicant had to cover her roommate’s share of the
rent. Her difficulties were exasperated when she experienced periods of unemployment
at various times in 2014, 2015, and 2016. She did not file her tax returns or pay the tax
owed because she did not have the money to do so.3
When  she  was  interviewed  by  a  defense  investigator  in  November  2017,  she
indicated she was working with an accountant to get her tax returns filed. She provided
documentation  showing  that  she  filed  her  2012  through  2015  federal  returns  in  May
2018. She also provided documentation that her 2016 federal return was prepared, but
she failed to provide proof that it was filed. Applicant provided documentation showing
1 Items 5, 9.
2 Items 4, 9.
3 Item 9; AE A.
that  in  August  2018,  the  IRS  accepted  an  installment  payment  plan  from  her  whereby
$140  monthly  will  be  withdrawn  from  her  bank  account  to  pay  the  taxes,  penalty  and
interest  that  she  owes.  Applicant  failed  to  produce  evidence  that  any  payments  have
been  made  to  the  IRS  under  the  plan.  She  also  failed  to  produce  documentation
addressing the filing of her 2013 through 2015 state tax returns. Applicant’s tax issues
remain unresolved.4
Applicant claims the medical debt is resolved and is awaiting paperwork to verify
the debt is paid. She failed to provide any documentation disputing this debt or showing
resolution by payment. This debt remains unresolved.5
Applicant  provided  some  budget
the
Government’s interrogatories in May 2018. According to that information, she is left with
approximately $750 at the end of the month after paying all her expenses (this includes
paying  her  $140  monthly  tax  installment  payment).  There  is  no  evidence  of  financial
counseling.6
