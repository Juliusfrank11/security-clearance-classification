(Item 4)
Financial
The SOR alleges in 1.a-1.aa, a 2012 state  tax lien in the amount of $2,087;  four
student  loans  in  collection;  collection  accounts;  charged  off  accounts;  and  car
repossessions for a total of 27 delinquent debts totaling approximately $230,936. (Item
1)  Applicant  admitted  the  financial  allegations  listed  on  the  SOR  and  provided
explanations. He claims that some accounts are duplicates and that he has  some debts
that  were  judgments.  (Item  3)  Applicant  believes  that  his  delinquent  debt  is  about
$173,609.43 and that the majority of the debt consists of student loans.
Applicant  attributes  his  delinquent  debts  to  unemployment,  job  instability  and
garnishment  of  some  of  his  wages  for  a  rental  car  charge  of  about  $8,000  that  was
charged  to  his  corporate  credit  card  in  2016,  and  his  lack  of  payments.  He  was
unemployed  from    June  2009  to  August  2010  due  to  a  contract  ending.  (Response  to
FORM) He was also unemployed from February to April 2017. (Item 5)
Applicant admitted that he owes the state tax lien in SOR 1.a, and that he will be
establishing a payment plan with the state to resolve the issue. (AE A)
As to SOR allegations for student loans 1.b, 1.c, 1.g, and  1.aa, Applicant states
that he has consolidated the student debt in the amount of $180,000 into $118 433, and
that he has started making payments on the loans. He submitted a May 2018 letter stating
that    he  was  enrolling  in  a  rehabilitation  program  for  the  student  loans,  but  he  did  not
submit any documentation that he has started the program by making any payments. It
appears from the record that a garnishment of $5,300.82 was deducted from his 2018
paycheck.
1  Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  security  clearance  application  (Item  4)  unless
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
As to 1.d, 1. e, and 1.m,  all car loans, Applicant states that they have been paid
in judgments in 2014. There is no information that any judgments have been released. It
does appear in a credit report that he submitted that the allegation in 1.d was  settled for
less than the full balance. (AE A)
As to 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.k ,1.l, 1.n, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, 1.r ,1.s, 1.v, 1.y, and 1.z, Applicant
responded to the FORM by stating that he will be setting up a payment plan soon. These
accounts are on the credit reports and Applicant did not submit any evidence of  payments
made or payment agreements. (Answer to FORM)
As to 1.e, 1.j, 1.m,  and 1.t, Applicant claims that they have been resolved as they
are no longer on his credit reports. However, the remaining SOR alleged debts appear
on  the 2017  credit  report submitted by  Applicant as  charged-off  accounts  or collection
accounts. It does not reflect that any were actually paid.
Some of the debts appear to be duplicates as Applicant explains. SOR allegation
1.x  appears  to  be  a  duplicate  of  1.t;  1.w  is  the  same  as  1.o;  1.y  is  the  same  as  1.v.
Applicant does not state that they are paid. They are either not on the credit report or he
will set up a payment plan. He wanted to emphasize that the total amount he allegedly
owes is less than what the SOR states.
Personal Conduct
The SOR alleges under Personal Conduct 2.a through 2.h, an arrest in 2015 and
a  charge  of  theft  of  a  motor  vehicle,  a  felony;  termination  of  employment  in  2017  for
misuse of a company credit card and ineligibility for rehire; unauthorized use of another
company’s credit card for personal expenses of in the amount of $8,000 that Applicant
did not reimburse; five falsifications on his 2017 security clearance application including
not reporting termination of employment (section 13 A and C); not listing the wronglful
use of a company credit card (Section 26); and  finally not listing an arrest. (Item1)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  2015,  and  charged  with  theft  of  a  motor  vehicle.
However,  he  was  renting  a  car  and  presented  documentation  that  he  was  released
unconditionally from jail the following day. He did not report any details about the situation.
Applicant denied that he was fired in 2017. He stated that he voluntarily left the
job. He plans to repay the $8,000 charged on his corporate credit card. Applicant claims
he lost his comnpany  card and that a hotel charged an expense on that card  instead of
his personal card.
Applicant denied the five falsifications as described above. He stated that none of
the actions were done purposely and that he stands ready to take responsibility for them.
He did not articulate a credible reason why he did not list the incidents on his 2017 security
clearance application.
