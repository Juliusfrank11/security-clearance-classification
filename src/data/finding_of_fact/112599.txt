Under  Guideline  F,  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  owes  the  federal
government $58,490, a debt that is being enforced through a tax lien filed against him in
2007 (SOR 1.a). In response to the SOR, Applicant denied that he was subject to a federal
tax lien.4 (FORM, Item 1)
Applicant is 43 years old. After graduating from college in June 2002, he was hired
in October 2002 as an engineer by a federal contractor. He still works for that company,
and he first received a security clearance in August 2006. (FORM, Item 2)
In July 2000, Applicant bought a house. In May 2012, he gifted an interest in that
house to his parents. All three persons have since owned that property in joint tenancy.
(FORM, Item 1; Response)
In September 2003, the IRS filed a lien against Applicant’s parents to enforce a
$58,462.25  debt  for  unpaid  taxes  between  1997  and  1999.  The  lien  was  released  in
October 2012. (FORM, Items 1, 4, and 5)
A credit report obtained by investigators in February 2017 shows a tax lien filed in
May 2007 that is attributed only to Applicant. A tax record obtained in August 2018 shows
a  tax  lien  filed  in  May  2007  that  is  attributed  to  both  Applicant  and  his  parents.  Both
records  show  a  lien  for  an  amount  that  is  $27.75  more  than  the  2003  lien  against
Applicant’s parents. The lien also carries a different filing number from the satisfied tax
lien against Applicant’s parents. (FORM, Items 4 and 5)
2 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive).
3 See Directive, Section E3.1.7. In the FORM, Department Counsel relies on five enclosed exhibits (Items
1 – 5).
4  His  denial  renders  SOR  1.a  as  a  controverted  issue  of  fact  and  requires  the  Government  to  produce
sufficient reliable information to support the allegation. See Directive, Section E3.1.14.
On  October  10,  2018,  the  attorney  for  Applicant’s  parents5  wrote  to  the  IRS  to
contest both the lien and its entry on Applicant’s credit history. In that letter, he averred
that in 2003, when the lien was obtained against Applicant’s parents, they did not have
any assets to which the lien could attach. He further opined that Applicant’s name was
included  in  the  lien  in  June  2012  after  he  and  his  parents  became  joint  owners  of  the
house he gifted to them. Because Applicant’s name was also on the title as a joint tenant
at that time, Applicant also became a subject of the lien. (Response)
At some point before receiving an interest in Applicant’s house, his parents had
arranged with the IRS to repay their tax debt. As part of that agreement, the IRS advised
them the lien would be renewed periodically to protect the IRS’ interest until the lien was
satisfied.  Applicant’s  counsel  argues  that  the  May  2007  filing  date  represented  only  a
renewal of the 2003 lien by the IRS against Applicant’s parents, and that it was not the
date Applicant’s name was added to the lien. Further, a renewal four years after the lien
was first filed might explain the different filing number and slightly different amount of debt
that  was  the  subject  of  the  lien.  Accordingly,  Applicant’s  position  is  that  in  June  2012,
when he gifted an interest in his house to his parents while the lien was still active, the
IRS attached the lien to the house and its owners, and that there is only one lien at issue
here.  As  of  November  9,  2018,  the  IRS  had  not  responded  to  Applicant’s  attorney’s
October 10, 2018 letter. (FORM, Items 3 – 5; Response)
Applicant’s explanation of this matter is plausible. The record does not contain any
information that clearly establishes the presence of another tax lien against Applicant that
is still unresolved. The differences between the details of the release of lien order provided
by Applicant and the information about the lien presented in the FORM are minor. Without
additional information showing how Applicant incurred his own tax debt, those differences
are inconsequential. Based on all of the foregoing, I find as fact that the only tax lien at
issue  in  this  case  was  the  lien  originally  filed  against  Applicant’s  parents  in  2003  and
resolved  in  2012.  Further,  the  tax  lien  filed  in  May  2007  was  the  same  lien  and  was
attributed  to  Applicant  only  through  operation  of  the  joint  home  ownership  with  his
parents, and not because of any failure by Applicant to file or pay his taxes.
