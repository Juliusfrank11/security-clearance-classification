Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR, with clarifications. Applicant’s
April 2017 security clearance application (Item 3), and the credit reports dated June 1,
2017 and April 17, 2018, establish the allegations. (Item 5; Item 6.) After a thorough and
careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 43 years old. He earned an associate’s degree in 1995, and financed
that  education  with  student  loans.  He  is  unmarried,  but  has  one  minor  child  from  a
previous relationship. He has worked for his current employer, a government contractor,
since January 2017. He was employed by a different government contractor from October
2013  to  January  2017.  He  was  laid  off  from  his  previous  employer  in  October  2017.
However,  it  is  unclear  from  the  record  how  long  Applicant  was  unemployed.  He  also
experienced  a  period  of  unemployment  in  March  2009  through  May  2010  due  to  his
employer closing his place of employment. (Item 3.)
Applicant  is  indebted  on  a  delinquent  student-loan  account  in  the  amount  of
$18,266, as stated in SOR ¶ 1.a. Applicant attributed his inability to resolve this debt to
his layoff. Applicant’s August 2018 credit report reflects Applicant made a $719 payment
on this account in February 2018, but that no further payments had been made through
August 2018, despite being employed during that time. This debt is unresolved. (Answer.)
Applicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $529, as stated in
SOR ¶ 1.b. Applicant identified this debt as a credit-card account on his security clearance
application. This debt has been delinquent since  May  2017. He  explained that  he was
living “paycheck to paycheck” and planned to resolve the debt “as [he] just got a good
job.” (Item 3.) In his Answer, he asserted this debt “has fallen off [his] credit report.” It
does not appear on his August 2018 credit report. However, he failed to resolve the debt
in a responsible manner. (Answer; Item 3; Item 5.)
Applicant is indebted on a delinquent child-support account in the amount of $206,
as stated in SOR ¶ 1.c. On his security clearance application, Applicant explained that he
fell  in  arrears  on  his  child-support  obligation  when  unemployed  in  2009  to  2010.  He
indicated he was resolving the arrears through payments of $84 per month. The August
2018  credit  report  that  accompanied  his  Answer  reflected  Applicant  made  regular
payments on this debt from August 2016 through July 2018. Applicant is resolving this
debt. (Answer; Item 3.)
Applicant was indebted on a collection account in the amount of $66, as stated in
SOR  ¶  1.d.  This  debt  was  incurred  after  Applicant  moved  out  of  an  apartment  he
previously leased. Applicant’s August 2018 credit report reflects this debt is “paid, closed.”
It is resolved. (Answer; Item 3.)
Applicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $280, as stated in
SOR ¶ 1.e. This debt became delinquent in 2016. On his security clearance application,
Applicant explained that this was for a cell phone bill that he incurred when he “switched
lines.”  (Item  3.) He  indicated  he attended  to  resolve  this  account. However,  it  remains
unresolved. (Item 5.)
Applicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $198, as stated in
SOR  ¶  1.f.  This  debt  has  been  delinquent  since  2011.  On  his  security  clearance
application, Applicant explained that he fell into arrears on this cable bill, but planned to
pay it off soon. In his Answer, Applicant explained that this debt “dropped off” his credit
report. It is unresolved. (Answer; Item 3; Item 5.)
Applicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $174, as stated in
SOR ¶ 1.g. This debt was for another delinquent phone bill. It was placed for collections
in  2015.  Applicant’s  August  2018  credit  report  reflects  this  debt  remains  past  due.
(Answer.) It is unresolved.
