Applicant  is  a  56-year-old  senior project manager who  has  worked  in  the  same
capacity  for  the  past  decade.  He  completed  high  school  and  attended  some  college-
level  courses.  Applicant  is  married  with  one  child,  aged  20.  He  has  not  served  in  the
U.S. military.
In  February  2015,  Applicant filed for bankruptcy  protection  under Chapter 13.  It
covered  approximately  $700,000  in  debt.  (Tr.  21) This  route  was  initiated  as  a  way  to
save  his  home  and  to  lighten  Applicant’s  stress  after  suffering  a  heart  attack.  Despite
the bankruptcy protection, he could not make the monthly payments on the plan and he
fell  about  $33,000  behind  on  monthly  bankruptcy  payments.  He  ultimately  decided  to
terminate the bankruptcy, sell the house, move to a smaller apartment,  and then make
progress  on  some  of  the  debts  with  excess  proceeds  from  the  house  sale.  His
bankruptcy petition was dismissed in August 2015. (Tr. 22)
As  a  result  of  the  bankruptcy  dismissal, Applicant  remained  indebted  to  several
other creditors noted in the SOR at the following allegations:
1.b.i-iii - Three timeshare balances ($5,142, $11,300, $14,486) – Applicant provided
a copy of his current Experian credit report indicating that the account at allegation
1.b.iii ($14,486) was charged off in 2018. No indication of the balance at that time is
reflected;  he  was  only  told  there  was  no  longer  any  outstanding  debt  for  him  to
address.  He  last  spoke  with  the  three  entities  about  their  statuses  about  a  month
after the SOR was issued. (Tr. 29) He was again informed no outstanding debt was
owed.  Neither  of  the  other  two  timeshare  accounts  are  represented  in  the  credit
report, although he stated they were similarly charged off. (Ex. D at 9; Tr. 28-30)
1.b.iv – This account was for an insurance policy Applicant stated he terminated. (Tr.
32) The balance at issue is for $2,377. He testified that he was given a refund check
after  the  account  was  closed,  but  no  documentary  evidence  regarding  either  the
account closure or the refund could be located before the record closed.
1.b.v – This is for a disputed debt regarding damage to a rental car. (Tr. 33)  Since
Applicant failed to provide the company with his insurance information, it sought an
adverse judgment against him for $13,999. Applicant has paid nothing on this debt.
(Tr.  34)  Although  Applicant  provided  no  documentation  reflecting  he  disputed  the
debt, he said he continues to dispute this debt.
Applicant  owed  a  $41,000  tax  debt  to  the  federal  government  (IRS).  That  debt
originally represented combined taxes owed for Applicant and his wife for the period of
2007-2008.  At  the  time,  both  spouses  were  W-2  employees  and  she  had  not  been
having  sufficient  money  withheld  from  her  paychecks  to  cover  her  portion  of  their  tax
liability.  (Tr.  15)  Applicant  is  unsure  if  they  were  filing  jointly  before  2008.  However,
when it came time to pay their income taxes, they did not have enough cash reserves to
do so. The couple ultimately entered into a repayment agreement with the IRS  in early
2018. (Ex. 3; Tr. 16-17)
That  agreement  has  since  had  other  tax  year  obligations  added  to  its  total
outstanding balance, such as $1,000 owed for tax year 2018, $12,000 for tax year 2015,
$2,000  for  tax  year  2014,  and  $3,900  for  tax  year  2013.  (Tr.  13-15)  Payments  on  the
plan started in February 2018 at $400 a month and rose to $500 a month in April 2019.
Meanwhile, he requested that his tax liability for tax years 2007, 2008, and 2009, or any
federal  tax  liability  over  10  years  old,  be  dropped.  (Tr.  13)  They  have  made  progress
reducing this debt. (Tr. 12-13; Ex. B) The balance now owed to the IRS was shown to
now be $26,970 for balances owed for tax years 2017, 2015-2012, and 2010. (Ex. B)
Also  at  issue  is  a  2017  state  tax  liability  for  approximately  $960.  He  has  a
financial  arrangement  to  pay  off  that  balance  through  monthly  payments  of  $50.  He
initiated that plan at the beginning of 2019 with an initial payment of $300 or $400. (Tr.
19-20) (Ex. C) The remaining balance owed is $431.33. (Ex. C; Tr. 20)]
Today, Applicant is living within his means. He has a total monthly net income of
about  $9,591,  with  a  monthly  net  remainder  of  about  $2,100.  (Ex.  A)  He  is  generally
paying more than the minimum balances on his debts, where applicable (i.e. IRS, state,
car  loan,  credit  card).  He  has  made  reasonable  reductions  in  living  expenses,
consolidated  their  needs  for  vehicles  down  to  only  having  one  car,  and  focused  on
saving. Applicant plans to continue paying off the rest of his debt and, to ameliorate the
heavy financial burden of renting a home by buying a condo in July 2010. He feels he is
now financially on “the right path.” (Tr. 37)
