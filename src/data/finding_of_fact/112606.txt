Applicant  is  37  years  old  and  single.  He  reports  no  children.  He  was  born  in
Baghdad,  Iraq  and  he  served  as  a  linguist  for  a  federal  contractor  attached  to  armed
forces of the United States from 2003 to 2009. (GE 1, Tr. 15, 35) He went on more than
1,000  combat  patrols.  (Tr.  86)  Applicant  has  one  brother,  age  30,  who  served  as  a
linguist  in  support  of  U.S.  Marines  in  Iraq  for  five  years.  (Tr.  36)  He  also  has  three
sisters  still  living  in  different  cities  in  Iraq  with  their  husbands  and  families.  Their  ages
are 31, 39, and 42. Applicant’s parents moved from Iraq to Syria in 2005 and remained
for  three  years.  (Tr.  38-39)  Next,  they  moved  to  Turkey  due  to  the  instability  in  Syria.
Applicant moved to the U.S. in 2009 on a special immigrant visa program and he was
naturalized in 2014. (Tr. 15)
Applicant’s  mother  served  in  the  Ministry  of  Education  in  Iraq  for  22  years,  and
his father retired from the Iraqi Army as a major in 1989-’90, after more than 20 years of
service.    (Tr.  30-31)  Applicant  provided  financial  support  of  $250,  once  a  month  from
2010-2016,  to  his  parents  for  such  things  as  medical  bills.  (Tr.  39)  They  are  refugees
residing  in  Turkey.  Applicant  has  telephonic  contact  with  his  parents  once  or  twice  a
week. (Tr. 40-41) Applicant has filed an application with the Embassy in Turkey to try to
move  them  to  the  U.S.  on  a  visa.  His  brother  tutors  school  children  in  Iraq.  They  last
had  contact  more  than  three  years  ago.  (Tr.  43)  Applicant’s  two  oldest  sisters  are
teachers in Iraq and his youngest sister never worked. (Tr. 44) In addition to providing
financial support to his parents, as needed, Applicant gave his youngest sister $900 to
help  her  buy  a  car.  (Tr.  45)  His  telephonic  contact  with  his  sisters  varies  from  once
every two weeks to once a month. He has no property in Iraq, and held a bank account
there briefly from 2008-2009. (Tr. 89)
Applicant  submitted  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  on  February  28,
2017.2  In  section  22  (Police  Record)  of  his  SCA,  he  answered  “no”  to  all  questions
about  being  issued  any  summons,  citations,  tickets  to  appear  in  court  in  a  criminal
proceeding  etc. Applicant failed to disclose  the  civil  summons,  4  criminal  summonses,
25  citations  and  18  traffic  warnings  that  he  received  between  November  2010  and
September  2016.  (GE  4-11)  He  admitted  all  of  these  traffic  violations  in  his  Answer.
Applicant submitted AE A, an updated state division of motor vehicles driving record, to
show that he has not had any vehicle violations since 2015. Applicant testified credibly
that he may have misinterpreted the questions in this section of the SCA but since all of
his  citations  involved  fines  of  less  than  $300,  he  was  not  required  to  report  them.  (Tr.
82) Since all of the charges against him alleged in SOR ¶¶ 2.a–2.e were dismissed and
Applicant  served  no  community  service,  paid  no  fines,  and  had  no  consequences,  he
misunderstood  and  believed  he  did  not  have  to  report  these  in  his  SCA.  (Tr.  83)  To
corroborate his testimony on this point, he did disclose his arrest for domestic violence
1  Unless  otherwise  stated,  the  basis  for  these  findings  of  fact  is  Applicant’s  Questionnaire  for  National
Security  Positions  (SCA)  dated  February  28,  2017  (GE  1)  and  the  summaries  of  personal  subject
interviews conducted on July 27, 2017, and December 8, 2017. (GE 2)

in  2015  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  and  protective  order  against  him,  as  well  as  the  arrest  for
communicating  threats  in  2016,  to the  clearance  investigator  in  his  December  8,  2017
clearance interview. (GE 2, Tr. 117) He disclosed this offense because it is the only one
where he went to trial.
In September 2011, Applicant lived with his girlfriend. They had a disagreement
and when he tried to move out, she gave him only half of his personal property. (Tr. 58)
She tried to shove him out the door and he allegedly pushed her. The judge dismissed
this complaint at SOR ¶ 2.a. (Tr. 58) In SOR ¶ 2.b, Applicant lent $250 to a female co-
worker  who  was  in  financial  distress  in  January  2015.  He  asked  her  for  a  check  to
secure this loan, which he would only cash after she became solvent. (Tr. 60-63) When
he  later  tried  to  cash  the  check,  he  found  that  there  were  insufficient  funds  in  her
account  and  confronted  her.  She  tried  to  snatch  the  cold  check  out  of  his  hand  and
called police. He was charged with trespassing and the judge summarily dismissed that
complaint and had her arrested for uttering a false instrument. (Tr. 63) In August 2015,
a  mentally  ill  neighbor  alleged  that  Applicant  committed  simple  assault,  but  promptly
dropped  the  charges. (GE  6, Tr. 63)  Again, Applicant  was  arrested for  communicating
threats against a former business partner in March 2016, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e, and
that charge was dismissed by the judge on May 16, 2016. (GE 8)
Applicant  obtained  his  commercial  driver’s  license  (CDL)  and  operated  a
transportation  company  from  2013-2017.  (Tr.  52)  He  received  numerous  citations  for
driving infractions during that period. (Tr. 55) Applicant testified that he started driving in
Iraq  when  he  was  14  years  old,  and  he  was  accustomed  to  driving  unimpeded  by
restrictions on speed, and rules and regulations. (Tr. 75) He had difficulty assimilating to
the rules of the road and driving laws when he moved to the U.S. at age 28. Although
he studied a safe driving booklet, passed a written exam, and took a state road test to
obtain his state driver’s license in 2009, he had a habit of speeding. (GE 9, 10, 11, Tr.
77)
Applicant  testified  credibly  that  despite  his  astonishing  number  of  driving
offenses,  his  state  license  was  never  suspended,  and  it  is  still  valid.  (Tr.  80,  AE  A)
Instead, he would routinely hire an attorney who  would go into state court and get the
driving offense reduced to improper equipment (odometer), and pay a fine – 25 times.
(Tr.  79)  Despite  this  ruse,  Applicant  was  aware  that  the  problem  was  not  a  defective
odometer.  (Tr.  123)  Applicant  admitted  that  he  took  too  long  to  change  his  driving
habits,  but  he  did  so.  (Tr.  79)  He  was  recently  issued  a  warning  in  2018  because  he
was driving his girlfriend’s car, which had an improperly displayed license plate. (Tr. 96)
Applicant  was  involved  in  a  civil  dispute  with  one  of  his  former  employee-truck
drivers, after that driver abandoned one of his trucks and left it unattended. (Tr. 12, GE
7) He was charged with simple assault on the other CDL driver in August 2015 at SOR
¶  2.d.  The  state  court  judge  dismissed  this  criminal  complaint  against  Applicant  on
September  28,  2015.  (GE  7)  Then,  a  civil  action  ensued  between  Applicant  and  the
same  driver  for  $4,500  that  Applicant  loaned  the  driver.  It  was  resolved  for  $4,500  in
Applicant’s favor.  (Tr. 72)  Applicant  reasonably  stated  that  he  had  no  reason  to  report
this  civil  action  in  his  favor,  in  his  SCA,  and  he  did  not  intend  to  falsify  that  form  or
deceive the government as alleged in SOR ¶ 3.c because this is all a matter of public
court records. (Tr. 114, 118, GE 7,12)
Applicant submitted AE B–K, which are character reference letters, and AE L-N,
which  are  certificates  of  appreciation  for  his  service  as  a  linguist  on  behalf  of  U.S.
Armed  Forces.  Notably,  he  served  coalition  forces  with  bravery  and  distinction  since
2006.  An  Army  Brigadier  General  stated  “service  of  local  national  translators  who  risk
their  safety,  and  that  of  their  families,  to  support  the  mission  and  U.S.  soldiers,  is
invaluable.”  (AE  B)  Applicant  was  first  employed  by  the  U.S.  military  as  a  general
laborer in 2004 in Iraq. Then, he served in direct support of combat units including the
82nd Airborne Division, and 2nd and 3rd Brigade Combat Teams, 4th Infantry Division, as
an Arabic translator. He performed so well that he was added to Army civil action teams
in 2008. (AE C-N)
