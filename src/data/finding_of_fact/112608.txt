In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments four of the factual
allegations  in  the  SOR  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a.,  1.b.,  1.e.,  and  1.f.).  Applicant’s  admissions  and
comments  are  incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  complete  and  thorough
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the
following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a sheet metal mechanic with his current employer since October 2014. A 1983 high
school graduate, he earned some college credits, but no degree. Applicant enlisted in the
U.S. Navy in May 1984, and he was honorably retired as a petty officer first class (E-6) in
May  2004.  He  was  granted  a  secret  clearance  in  1986,  and  it  was  renewed  in  2005.
Applicant was married in 1988. He has two daughters, born in 1989 and 1991.
Military Record
During  his  military  career,  Applicant  was  deployed  on  several  occasions  to  the
Eastern Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf. He was awarded the Navy Sea Service
Deployment Ribbon (four awards); the Navy Battle “E” Ribbon (four awards); the Navy
Good Conduct Medal (five awards); the National Defense Service Medal (two awards);
the Enlisted Aviation Warfare Insignia; the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal
(two awards); the Navy Expert Pistol Shot Medal; the Southwest Asia Service Medal; the
Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation (five awards); and the Armed Force Expeditionary
Medal.1

Financial Considerations2
Applicant  underwent  major  back  surgery  in  August  2011,  and  as  a  result,  his
employer did not allow him to work until he was fully recovered. Short-term disability, and
eventually long-term disability, payments were substantially less than his normal salary
and insufficient for him to maintain all of his accounts in a current status. As a result, some
accounts became delinquent. Applicant called his creditors to alert them to his financial
situation,  and  while  some  cooperated  with  him,  his  mortgage  lender  refused  to  do  so,
demanding  timely  full  payments.  In  an  effort  to  address  his  growing  financial  issues,
Applicant  searched  for  an  attorney,  finally  engaging  the  professional  services  of  one
particular  national  law firm  (law  firm  A).  His attorneys  advised  him  to  stop  making  any
mortgage  payments  and  indicated  that  the  missed  payments  would  be  added  to  the
backend  of  his  mortgage.  Commencing  in  December  2011,  and  continuing  for  over  a
year,  Applicant  paid  his  attorneys,  through  a  particular  law  firm  serving  as  a  financial
service previously known as company X, approximately $500 per month, and following
instructions, he did not pay his mortgage lender.3
After a year of making payments to law firm A, and obtaining no success regarding
any efforts by that law firm, Applicant was referred to another particular law firm (law firm
B)  located  in  the  same  suite  as  law  firm  A.4  He  continued  making  similar  monthly
payments to the new law firm, again for another year of professional services. Eventually,
after  an  additional  period  of  apparent  inaction,  law  firm  B  advised  him  to  file  for
bankruptcy.5  He  paid  a  bankruptcy  attorney  $3,200,  and  in  November  2014,  Applicant
filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.6 He listed $178,279
in assets, including $145,000 in real property; and $223,510 in total liabilities, including
$163,205 for creditors holding secured claims (two mortgages on his residence and one
vehicle loan), and $60,305 for creditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims.7 Applicant’s
statement  of  current  monthly  income  and  calculation  of  commitment  period  and
disposable income reflected $5,652 in monthly income, and an anticipated $5,924 in total

deductions, including payments for four accounts, which would have left him $272 short.8
A revised calculation was submitted, and it reflected $6,079 in monthly income, and an
anticipated $5,151 in total deductions, leaving him with $919 in disposable income.9 On
July  2,  2015,  the  bankruptcy  trustee  filed  a  motion  to  dismiss  the  Chapter  13  case
because Applicant had failed to provide a copy of his federal income tax return for the tax
year 2014.10 Because Applicant had already paid the bankruptcy trustee $5,967, and the
bankruptcy trustee had not made any disbursements to creditors, $5,449 was eventually
refunded  to  him,  and  the  remainder  was  retained  for  administration  expenses.  That
bankruptcy was dismissed in July 2015.11
As  a  result  of  the  bankruptcy  trustee’s  non-disbursement  of  payments  to
Applicant’s  creditors,  in  November  2015,  the  creditor  that  had  financed  Applicant’s
automobile, for which over $7,400 was still owed, repossessed the vehicle and sold it at
auction. There was no reported deficiency, and Applicant does not owe the creditor any
unpaid balance. During the period August 2015 through January 2016, Applicant made
payments  to  some  of  his  creditors,12  but  by  then,  accounts  had  become  even  more
delinquent  because  of  the  lengthy  period  of  previous  nonpayment  associated  with  the
previous  legal  guidance  not  to  make  payments  and  the  non-disbursements  by  the
bankruptcy trustee.
In  January  2016,  Applicant  refiled  for  bankruptcy  under  Chapter  13  of  the  U.S.
Bankruptcy  Code,  and  he  was  assigned  the  same  bankruptcy  trustee.13  He  listed
$167,608 in assets, including $145,000 in real property; and $223,510 in total liabilities,
including $155,695 for creditors holding secured claims (two mortgages on his residence),
and $67,815 for creditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims.14 Applicant’s statement
of current monthly income and calculation of commitment period and disposable income,
and the Chapter 13 Plan, reflected $4,136 in monthly income, and an anticipated $1,962
in monthly expenses, leaving him with $1,593 in disposable income, which he was to pay
the bankruptcy trustee per month for  60 months. In addition, Applicant was required to
participate in the mortgage modification mediation program and provide 31 percent of his
gross  income  until  mediation  or  until  the  loan  is  modified.15  On  May  26,  2016,  the
bankruptcy trustee filed a motion to dismiss the Chapter 13 case because Applicant had

failed to provide a copy of his federal income tax return for the tax year 2015.16 Because
Applicant  had  already  paid  the  bankruptcy  trustee  $9,381,  and  the  bankruptcy  trustee
again had not made any disbursements to creditors, $8,490 was eventually refunded to
him, and the remainder was retained for administration expenses. That bankruptcy was
dismissed in December 2016.17 Applicant subsequently explained that he was under the
impression that he was only supposed to make the established monthly payments to the
bankruptcy trustee, and that his income tax refunds ($1,100 for 2014 and $2,400 for 2015)
were  not  required  as  well.  Furthermore,  Applicant  did  not  want  to  relinquish  those
refunds.18
In  addition  to  his  two  Chapter  13  bankruptcies,  the  SOR  identified  seven
purportedly  delinquent  accounts  that had been  placed for collection  or charged  off, as
generally reflected by Applicant’s September 2015, August 2016, June 2017, or May 2018
credit  reports.  Those  debts  total  approximately  $65,147.  The  current  status  of  those
accounts is as follows:
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): This is a second mortgage on Applicant’s residence with an original
high credit of $60,000 that became delinquent and was placed for collection, with $44,205
charged off.19 However, commencing in November 2017 – nearly eight months before the
SOR was issued – Applicant entered into a repayment plan with the creditor, and since
that date, he has been consistently making weekly $125 payments, totaling $14,258, to
the creditor. As of April 2019, the unpaid balance has been decreased to $33,891.20 The
account is in the process of being resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): This is a finance company line of credit with a credit limit of $20,000
that  became  delinquent  and  was  placed  for  collection,  with  an  unspecified  amount
charged off. In May 2015, the account with an unpaid balance of $19,096 was sold to a
debt purchaser, erroneously referred to as a factoring company, and as of mid-2017, the
remaining unpaid balance was $18,571.21 In August 2018, Applicant agreed to repayment
arrangements under which he has automatic electronic weekly debits of $75 taken from
his account. In August 2018, the outstanding balance was $13,696, and by April 2019,
the remaining balance had been reduced to $11,196.22 The account is in process of being
resolved.

(SOR ¶ 1.e.): This is a credit union-issued automobile loan with a high credit of
$14,380 that  became  delinquent and  was  placed for collection,  with  $1,595  eventually
charged off.23 Applicant identified the vehicle as the one that had been repossessed, and
although  he believed  that  there  was  no  deficiency,  it  appeared  that  there actually  was
one. Applicant contacted the creditor and set up a settlement repayment agreement. He
made his final payment of $663.63 in April 2019, and the creditor considers the account
settled and satisfied.24 The account has been resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.f.): This is credit union-issued credit card with a high credit of $1,881 that
became delinquent and was placed for collection, with $1,826, not $1,881 as alleged in
the  SOR,  charged  off.25  Applicant  contacted  the  creditor  and  set  up  a  settlement
repayment  agreement.  He  made  his  final  payment  of  $564.58  in  April  2019,  and  the
creditor considers the account settled and satisfied.26 The account has been resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.g.): This is an unspecified medical account with an unpaid balance of
$729 that was placed for collection and listed in Applicant’s credit report identifying him
as the responsible party.27 Applicant disputed the account, claiming that the service was
provided  for  his  adult  daughter,  and  although  she  was  previously  removed  from  his
medical  coverage  under  TRICARE,  this  medical  provider  retained  Applicant  as  the
responsible party. Upon receiving the correct information, on April 5, 2019, the creditor
removed Applicant’s name from the account, and he is no longer responsible for it.28 The
account has been resolved.
(SOR  ¶  1.h.):  This  is  a  military  exchange  charge  account  with  a  credit  limit  of
$6,800  and  an  unpaid  balance  of  $4,500  that  was  placed  for  collection,  with  $3,880
charged off in February 2016.29 According to his June 2017 credit report, Applicant was
making payments.30 His most recent weekly $100 payment was made on April 19, 2019,
and  his  current  balance  was  reported  to  be  $6,180.31  There  is  no  indication  that  the
account is currently delinquent.

(SOR ¶ 1.i.): This is a military exchange charge account with a credit limit of $3,175
and an unpaid balance of $1,127 that was placed for collection, with $3,000 charged off
in  February  2016.32  According  to  his  June  2017  credit  report,  Applicant  was  making
payments.33 His most recent $189 payment was made on May 11, 2018, and his current
balance was reported to be zero.34 The account was closed by Applicant in 2018, and,
according to the creditor, is in good standing.35
Applicant was apparently the victim of predatory practices by some unscrupulous
professional  organizations  from  which  he  had  sought  professional  legal  guidance.  For
example,  in  2017,  law  firm  A  was  sued  by  the  states  of  Florida  and  Indiana,  seeking
injunctive relief, restitution, civil penalties, and other statutory relief for violations of the
states’ deceptive and unfair trade practices acts by the collection of advance payments;
material misrepresentations; prohibited representations; and failure to disclose. Law firm
A targeted consumers who were in financial distress, behind on their mortgage loans, or
in danger of losing their homes to foreclosure; it falsely represented the type of relief the
consumer would receive; it charged consumers upfront fees and continuing fees before
they  had  received  the  benefit  of  the  service;  it  misrepresented  the  likelihood  of
negotiating, obtaining, or arranging the represented mortgage relief services, as well as
the amount of time it would take to accomplish the represented mortgage relief services;
and it told consumers to stop making payments to their mortgage loan holder or servicer
and  to  start  making  payments  to  law  firm  A  to  begin  the  mortgage  loan  modification
process. According to one attorney general, law firm A caused consumers to suffer past
and ongoing  substantial injury,  including:  paying  thousands of  dollars to  law  firm A for
little or no service in return, going into foreclosure, and even losing their homes.36
Law firm B, the organization that was located at the same suite as law firm A, and
to  which  Applicant  was  referred  by  law  firm  A,  was  also  a  defendant  in  an  action  for
consumer  fraud,  this  time  by  the  department  of  banking  of  the  state  of  Connecticut.
Essentially repeating the concerns of Florida and Indiana against law firm A, Connecticut
issued  a  temporary  order  to  cease  and  desist;  an  order  to  make  restitution  to  any
Connecticut residents with whom it entered into negotiation agreements; notice of intent
to issue order to cease and desist; notice of intent to impose civil penalty; and notice of
right to hearing.37

Moreover,  Applicant’s  difficulties  also  extended  to  company  X,  the  organization
through which he was making payments to law firms A and B. A class-action lawsuit was
brought  against  company  X  in  2011,  claiming  the  company  violated Washington  State
law  and  the  federal  Racketeer  Influenced  and  Corrupt  Organizations  Act  (RICO)  by
conspiring with debt settlement providers to defraud consumers through trust accounts
related  to  useless  debt-settlement  programs.  Company  X  was  the  lynchpin  in  a  broad
criminal  enterprise  which  directly  facilitated  the  fleecing  of  hundreds  of  thousands  of
unsuspecting  consumers  by  sending  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  in  exorbitant  and
unearned fees to fraudulent debt-settlement companies and charged its own inflated fees
on each and every transaction. On May 15, 2015, the U.S. District Court issued a $1.45
billion  default  judgment  against  company  X,  which  unfortunately  for  the  plaintiffs,  had
already ceased doing business, leaving doubt that the plaintiffs would be paid.38
Aside  from  the  income  information  appearing  in  Applicant’s  two  Chapter  13
Voluntary Petitions, described above, on April 30, 2019, Applicant submitted a Personal
Financial  Statement  to  reflect  his  $6,573  net  monthly  income;  $2,613  in  monthly
expenses;  and  $3,965  in  debt  payments,  including  his  two  mortgages,  with  a  $2,608
monthly remainder.39
Within  180  days  before  Applicant filed  his initial  bankruptcy  petition  in  2014,  he
received  a  briefing  from  a  credit  counseling  agency.  He  managed  to  save  his  primary
mortgage  from  foreclosure,  and  that  account  is  now  current  following  a  mortgage
modification. There is substantial evidence to indicate that Applicant’s financial situation,
now that he has emancipated himself from the predatory  law firms and his bankruptcy
obligations, and his health has been restored, is now under control.
Work Performance and Character References

character  and  dedication  to  the  project.  Applicant’s  continuous  performance  in  the
leadership  role  demonstrates  dependability,  accountability,  dedication,  and  a  firm
foundation  of  generally  good  characteristic  traits  such  as  trustworthiness  and  ability  to
lead  peers.40  The  modification  associate  manager  of  the  program  also  referred  to
Applicant’s dependability, accountability, and dedication, and he added that Applicant’s
