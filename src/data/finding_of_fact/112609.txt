Applicant  is  a  56-year-old  potential  employee  of  a  Department  of  Defense
contractor seeking a security clearance. He is being sponsored for a security clearance
by the DoD contractor and will be hired as a linguist if he receives a security clearance.
Applicant was born in Iraq and immigrated to the United States in 1980 at the age of 18.
He became a US citizen in 1989. From 1990 to 1995, he served on active duty in the
US Air Force. He separated with an honorable discharge. After his active duty tour, he
served  in  the  Air  National  Guard  from  September  1995  to  August  1998.  He  earned  a
bachelor  of  science  degree  while  serving  in  the  Air  National  Guard.  He  studied  for  a
master’s  degree,  but  did  not  complete  the  master’s  program.  From  2002  to  2005,  he
attended medical school. He earned his doctor of medicine (MD), but never practiced as
a doctor because he did not complete a medical residency. (Gov 1; Gov 5; Gov 6)
From 2008 to 2011, Applicant served as a contract linguist overseas. He held a
secret clearance during this period. After his return to the United States, he occasionally
worked  for his brother’s  translation  business.  Applicant  never found  a full-time  job.  He
took  care  of  his  mother  who  suffered  from  dementia  until  she  was  put  in  an  inpatient
facility  in  August  2017.  She  passed  away  in  July  2018.    Applicant  was  married  and
divorced twice. His most recent divorce occurred in 2007.  He has no children.  (Tr. 21,
24, 27, 29-30. 52-59; Gov 1; Gov 6)
Guideline F, Financial Considerations:
Applicant’s  security  clearance  background  investigation  revealed  the  following
delinquent  debts:  a  $3,814  judgment  filed  against  Applicant  in  February  2016  for  a
delinquent credit card debt (SOR ¶ 1.a: Gov 2 at 2-3); a $4,910 judgment filed against
Applicant  in  August  2016  (SOR  ¶  1.b:  Gov  2  at  4-5);  a  $935  judgment  filed  against
Applicant  in  November  2017  (SOR  ¶  1.c:  Gov  2  at  6-7);  six  charged-off  delinquent
student  loans  in  the  respective  amounts  of  $31,776;  $29,514;  $28,741;  $27,500;
$18,627;  and $15,620 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d – 1.i: Gov 3 at 3-4; Gov 4 at 2).
Additional delinquent accounts include: a $4,596 charged off credit-card account
(SOR ¶ 1.j: Gov 3 at 4; Gov 4 at 2); a $4,092 charged-off credit-card account (SOR ¶
1.k: Gov 3 at 4; Gov 4 at 2); a $3,466 charged-off credit-card account (SOR ¶ 1.l: Gov 3
at 4; Gov 4 at 2); a $2,047 charged-off account (SOR ¶ 1.m: Gov 3 at 4; Gov 4 at 2-3); a
$437 charged-off department store credit-card account (SOR ¶ 1.n: Gov 3 at 5; Gov 4 at
3); a $3,514 delinquent account that was placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.o: Gov 3 at 12);
a $1,445 delinquent account placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.p: Gov 3 at 12; Gov 4 at 3);
a $719 delinquent account that was placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.q: Gov 3 at 12); and
a  $624  debt  owed  to  a  timeshare  that  was  placed  for  collection  (SOR  ¶  1.r:  Gov  3  at
12).
Additional  delinquent  accounts  include:  a  $610  delinquent  debt  placed  for
collection  (SOR ¶ 1.s: Gov 3 at 12;  Gov 4 at 3); a $610 phone or cable debt placed for
collection  (SOR  ¶  1.t:  Gov  3  at  13);  a  $107  cable  television  bill  placed  for  collection
(SOR ¶ 1.u: Gov 3 at 13); and an $18,114 student loan that was past due in the amount
of $868 (SOR ¶ 1.v: Gov 4 at 2). Applicant also admits he failed to file federal income
tax returns for tax year 2016. (SOR ¶ 1.w: Gov 4 at 2)
Applicant admits all of the debts. The student loans were private loans he took
out  to  finance  a  master’s  program  and  his  medical  school.  He  began  to  encounter
financial problems when he attended medical school. His wife filed for divorce when he
was in medical school. He made some student-loan payments while he was working as
a linguist, but stopped making payments in 2012 after he returned to the United States
because he could not afford to make payments. Applicant earned $145,000 annually as
a  linguist.  He  lost  the  position  when  the  mission  ended  and  the  contract  linguist  staff
was reduced. (Tr. 45-47)
When  Applicant  returned  to  the  United  States  he  used  money  earned  while
overseas to purchase and remodel a house. He purchased the house for approximately
$57,000  and  spent  between  $160,000  to  $180,000  remodeling  the  house.  Applicant
estimates  the  house  is  worth  approximately  $200,000.  The  house  has  no  mortgage.
Applicant testified that he currently earns below the poverty line and that he qualifies for
Medicaid.  In  2013, he  earned  less  than $10,000.    He  could  not find  a  well-paying  job.
He  stayed  at  home  to  care  for his mother from  the  summer  2014  to  August  2017.  He
earned $300 a month caring for his mother. (Tr. 33-37; Gov 6)
When asked why he bought a house rather than pay off his student loan debts,
Applicant replied:
Because I  needed  –  if  I  would’ve  –  see,  it  was  just  –  I thought  if  just  put
this money towards paying debt, I wouldn’t have anything. And I thought if
I  could  buy  a  house,  I  could  have  something  to  function  from,  like  a
headquarters and go back to work. (Tr. 74)
Applicant  has  a  side  business  of  selling  guitars  on  the  Internet.  He  claims  the
market  is  slow  and  he  has  not  made  many  sales  because  customers  would  like  to
purchase  the  guitars  well  below  market  prices.  He  estimates  his  guitar  collection  is
worth $15,000.  He also purchased several Persian rugs when he was in Iraq with the
purpose of selling the rugs in the U.S. He discovered that the market is saturated with
Persian  rugs  and  he  would  be  unable  to  sell  them  for  a  profit.  He  also  occasionally
bought and sold cars. (Tr. 35, 71-73; Gov 6)
Applicant admits he did not file his federal income tax returns for tax year 2016.
During the hearing, Applicant volunteered that the last time he filed his federal income
tax returns was 2015. He did not file for tax year 2017. It is not clear whether Applicant
is required to file an income tax return because of his low income. I considered this and
also considered that Applicant’s failure to file his 2017 tax return was not alleged in the
SOR.  I  will  not  consider  it  when  applying  the  disqualifying  factors.  However,  I  will
consider it to assess Applicant’s overall financial situation, when considering matters in
mitigation, and when applying the whole-person analysis.
Applicant made payments towards the student loans alleged in SOR ¶ 1.v for a
while.  After  the  hearing,  he  provided  documents  showing  the  current  balance  on  the
loans to be $4,791 and $18,472. Applicant consolidated these loans with his former wife
when they were still married. (AE B; AE C, tab 3) Applicant paid another student loan off
in  full.  This  loan  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  (AE  A,  AE  C,  tab  1)  Applicant  has  not
attended formal financial counseling. (Tr. 75)
After  the  hearing,  Applicant  provided  statements  from  his  private  student-loan
creditor indicating that the student loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e – 1.f are no longer being
collected  because  the  statute  of  limitations  expired  for  each  of  these  loans.  Applicant
may  receive  a  Form 1099 for this forgiveness.  (AE  D) There  is  one  remaining  student
loan with this creditor with a balance of $31,776. (SOR ¶ 1.d)
Guideline E, Personal Conduct:
Under  Personal  Conduct,  Applicant’s  is  alleged  to  have  falsified  his  answers  to
several  questions  regarding  his  financial  situation  on  his  e-QIP  application  which  was
signed  by  him  on  July  12,  2017.  In  response  to  “Section  26  –  Financial  Record  –
Delinquency  Involving  Enforcement  –  Other  than  previously  listed,  have  any  of  the
following happened to you? . . . . In the past seven (7) years, you had had a judgment
entered  against  you?”    Applicant  answered,  “No.”    He  did  not  list  the  two  judgments
entered against him in 2016 which are alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. (Gov 1)
Applicant also answered, “No” in response to the “Section 26 – Financial Record
–  Delinquency  Involving  Routine  Accounts  –  Other  than  previously  listed,  have  any  of
the following happened? . . . . In the past seven (7) years, you had bills or debts turned
over to a collection agency? . . . . In the past seven (7) years, you had nay account or
credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed? . . . . In the
past  seven  (7)  years,  you  defaulted  on  any  type  of  loan?  .  .  .  .  In  the  past  seven  (7)
years you had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency? . . . . In the past seven
(7) years, you had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for
failing to pay as agreed? . . . . In the past seven (7) years you have been over 120 days
delinquent  on  any  debt  not  previously  entered?”    Applicant  did  not  list  any  of  the
delinquent accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d – 1.u.
Applicant  testified  that  he  is  not  sure  why  he  did  not  list  his  judgments  and
delinquent debts on his e-QIP.  He said his failure to answer, “Yes” could have been a
mistake,  or  possibly  he  did  not  understand  what  the  questions  meant.  He  must  have
overlooked the question regarding judgments. His failure to list his 2016 judgments was
not  deliberate.    Applicant  testified  that  he  did  not  understand  what  was  meant  by
“judgment”. He admits that he appeared at trial regarding the judgment alleged in SOR
¶ 1.b, but understood that he and the attorney settled the matter before judgment. (Tr.
63-66)
Applicant admits that he had debts that delinquent for more than 120 days when
he completed the e-QIP. He is not sure why he answered, “No” to the questions under
Section 26 – Delinquency Involving Routine Accounts. (Tr. 66-69)
Whole-Person Factors:
Applicant  submitted  certificates  and  awards  related  to  his  honorable  military
service  in  the  US  Air  Force;  documents  related  to  his  medical  school  training  and
education to include favorable reference letters; and certificates of appreciation related
to his service as a contract linguist in Iraq. (AE C, Tabs 2 and 4)
Applicant  does  not  understand  why  his  poor  financial  situation  would  raise  a
security concern. He believes he  has demonstrated his loyalty by serving honorably in
the US Air Force, and by handling classified information without incident as a linguist in
Iraq.  He  assumed  that  since  he  was  granted  a  security  clearance  in  the  past,  his
security  clearance  should  continue.  He  intends  to  pay  his  debts  once  he  finds  a  well-
paying job. (Answer to SOR)
