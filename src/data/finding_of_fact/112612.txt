Applicant is 39 years old and married, with twin children who were born in January
2014. He earned a high school diploma in May 1998, and a bachelor’s degree from an
online university in May 2015. He has been employed by a defense contractor since April
2014, and is seeking to continue the security clearance he has held since 2007 during his
employment with several defense contractors. He was honorably discharged in February
2007, after serving for almost eight years in the Marine Corps Reserve. (Item 4.)
Applicant admitted owing the four delinquent credit card and consumer loan debts
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. These unpaid accounts totaled $23,361; were
opened by Applicant between September 2014 and March 2015; and became delinquent
in 2016 or early 2017. (Items 3, 4, 5, 7.)
The  fifth  SOR-alleged  debt  (¶  1.b)  involved  a  contract  that  Applicant  signed  in
March 2015 for a loan to purchase a car. He denied responsibility for repayment of the
loan  because,  on  some  unspecified  date,  another  person  had  “established  a  simple
contract” with him to take possession of the car and make the remaining loan payments.
Applicant  asserted  that  this undocumented  agreement  absolved  him  of  his contractual
responsibility to the seller. However, the other person stopped making the loan payments
in May 2016, then returned to live with his family in Mexico. The accident-damaged car
was  eventually  located  by  the  lender  and  repossessed.  Applicant  offered  no  evidence
that the creditor, from whom he borrowed money to buy the car, agreed to absolve him
of  his  contractual  obligations.  The  charged-off  past-due  balance  of  $15,231  remains
unresolved and actively listed on Appellant’s most recent credit report. (Items 3, 5, 7.)
On  July  5,  2018,  the  day  before  submitting  his  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant
made a payment of $608.68 to the collection agency that had acquired  the charged-off
delinquent $1,352 credit card debt from his original major-bank creditor. Applicant opened
this account in January 2015, and stopped making his required payments in September
2015. The collection agency accepted Applicant’s partial payment in full satisfaction of
the debt, which was alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d. This debt is now resolved. (Items 1, 3, 5, 7.)
Applicant  attributed  his  delinquencies  to  financial  strains  arising  out  of  his
November  2014  marital  separation.  However,  he  failed  to  describe  or  document  any
causal  relationship  between  that  separation  and  the  debts.  He  opened  the  largest
unsecured personal loan debt ($17,149 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a) in December 2014, which
was  after  the  separation  had  already  occurred.  His  second  largest  delinquency  (the
$15,231 charged-off car loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b) was opened in March 2015, some
four  months  after  the  separation.  On  his  March  2,  2017  e-QIP,  Applicant  reported  his
marital  status  as,  “Separated,”  since,  “11/11/2014  (Estimated).”  However,  he  also
reported that he had resided in the home he owns since June 2010, which has the same
address  at  which  he  reported  his  wife  and  two  children  were  then  living.  Applicant
provided no evidence of extra expenses from maintaining separate residences, of other
costs beyond his control, or of reasonable action to manage such issues. (Item 3.)
Applicant did not document any financial counseling. He did not submit budgetary
income or expense figures from which to analyze his future ability to meet family living
expenses  while  resolving  his  delinquencies.  Applicant  offered  no  evidence  concerning
the  level  of  responsibility  his  duties  entail  in  his  defense  contractor  work,  or  his  track
record  with  respect  to  handling  sensitive  information  and  observation  of  security
procedures. I was unable to evaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person,
since he elected to have his case decided without a hearing.
