Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  financial  allegations.  He  is  a  48-year-old  cyber
security specialist employed by a U.S. defense contractor since 2016. He has been self-
employed in similar positions since October 2010. His clearance status is unclear.
Since  2010,  Applicant  has  started  a  series  of  businesses,  sometimes  with
partners, sometimes solo. The tax structures of the various companies complicated his
personal taxes, which he found overwhelming. Consequently, he failed to timely file his
income tax returns as required. He considered obtaining professional help, and dabbled
some  with  an  individual  who  was  prepared  to  handle  matters  going  forward,  but  who
was not prepared to handle his back taxes. He recently hired an administrator, attorney,
and bookkeeper for his company, and his delinquent personal income tax returns were
filed  in  April  2019.  He  did  not  consider  timely  filing  of  his  tax  returns  to  be  an  urgent
matter, as he understood there was no penalty for filing late if a refund was due (Tr. 25-
26). He also changed his withholding so that he would almost always overpay, and be
entitled to a refund.
The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal income tax returns
for tax years 2010-2017 (2010-2013 for SOR 1.a; 2014-2017 for SOR 1.b), and that the
2014-2017 tax returns remained unfiled at the time of the SOR. Applicant’s November
2018 Answer included Applicant’s Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax transcripts for tax
years  2008-2017.  Tax  years  2008-2009  are  not  at  issue.  Applicant’s  2010-2013  tax
transcripts show that he timely filed for an extension of time to file  for tax years 2010,
2011,  and  2013,  and  that  he  timely  filed  his  2010  and  2013  income  tax  returns.
Although he timely filed for an extension for 2011, he did not file his tax return until nine
months after the extended due date. While he did not file for an extension for tax year
2012,  he  filed  the  return  within  three  months  of  the  due  date.  He received  substantial
tax refunds  for  each  of  the  years,  although  he  owes about  $800  on  tax year  2013  for
otherwise unexplained late payment penalties and interest (AE H). Applicant did not file
for extensions of time to file for tax years 2014-2017, and they remained unfiled at the
time  of  the  SOR. AE A-G  show that Applicant filed his 2014-2018 Federal income tax
returns  in  April  2019.  He  apparently  has  refunds  totaling  about  $32,463  for  state  and
Federal taxes for 2014-2017, but owes about $19,345 for 2018.
Applicant  provided  no  work  or  character  evidence,  or  evidence  of  community
involvement. He has not received credit or financial counseling. He provided no budget.
Specifically, while he submitted evidence that his delinquent taxes had now been filed,
he provided no evidence of contacts with the IRS to show his proposed arrangements
for reconciling the results of the four tax returns.
