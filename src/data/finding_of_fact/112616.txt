In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  47-year-old  custodian  employed  by  a  community  rehabilitation
foundation.  He  has  worked  on  a  military  installation  since  August  2016.  He  did  not
complete high school. He had kidney failure in June 2000, was hospitalized, underwent
a  kidney  transplant  and  dialysis,  and  was  supported  by  Social  Security  disability
payments. He was incarcerated from November 2010 to July 2012 and unemployed after
his release from prison until December 2012. He worked as a cook for a private-sector
employer  from  December  2012  to  February  2013.  He  worked  as  a  custodian  for  his
current  employer  from  February  2013  to  November  2014.  He  applied  for  a  security
clearance  in  December  2014,  but  it  was  denied.  (Form  Item  6  at  7.)  He  worked  as  a
custodian  in  the  private  sector  from  November  2014  until  he  began  his  current
employment.
Applicant married in August 2009 and separated in November 2010. He has no
contact with his wife and does not know where she lives. He is still married because he
cannot  afford  a  divorce.  (FORM  Item  6  at  2.)  He  has  four  adult  children  from  other
previous relationships and a nine-year-old grandchild who lives with him. (FORM Item 4
at 24-26; FORM Item 6 at 2.)
1 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (FORM Item 4) unless
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
Between  1992  and  1995,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  numerous  traffic  offenses,
including  driving  without  a  license,  driving  while  under  the  influence,  and  leaving  the
scene of an accident. (FORM Item 7 at 1-2.) These offenses were not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant  was  arrested  in  April  2003  for  three  counts  of  negotiating  worthless
checks. He had an acquaintance who printed fake checks, using the names of businesses
listed  in  the  phone  book.  Applicant  cashed  the  checks  and  gave  his  acquaintance  a
percentage of the proceeds. He was arrested after his third transaction with a fake check.
He was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for 20 days and a fine. He was placed
on probation for two years and ordered to pay restitution. (FORM Item 8 at 4.) This offense
is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a.
Applicant was arrested in September 2006 for felony possession of a forged check
for $418. In the October 2014 PSI, he told an investigator that he received the check from
a cousin and thought it was valid. (Form Item 5 at 4.) He was still on probation, which was
revoked.  He  was  convicted  and  sentenced  to  imprisonment  for  five  years,2  fined,  and
required to pay restitution. (FORM Item 8 at 4-5.) He was on probation from July 2007 to
November 2010. (FORM Item 3 at 32.) This offense is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b.
Applicant was charged with felony possession of a forged instrument in January
2010. He was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for five years, fined, and required
to pay restitution. He was incarcerated from November 2010 to July 2012. (FORM Item 3
at 31; FORM Item 7 at 4.) This offense is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c.
During the October 2014 PSI, Applicant told an investigator that he committed the
bad-check  crimes  because  he  was  unemployed  and  needed  money.  He  also  told  the
investigator  that  being  incarcerated  gave  him  time  to  reflect  on  his  life  and  led  him  to
make better life choices. (FORM Item 6 at 4.)
Applicant’s criminal record involving financial crimes is alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c
under Guideline J and cross-alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a under Guideline F. In addition, SOR ¶¶
2.b-2.e allege four delinquent debts reflected in Applicant’s credit report from April 2018
(FORM Item 11.). The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 2.b: child-support arrearage of $155,800. Applicant owes child support
for three children. His credit reports reflect that in March 2015, his arrearage was $14,065.
(FORM Item 9 at 1.) In April 2017, it was $150,597. (FORM Item 10 at 3.) In April 2018,
it was $155,800. (FORM Item 11 at 1.) Court records reflect as of June 25, 2018, he owed
$91,672 for Child  #1; $52,663 for Child #2; and $12,813 for Child #3. (Attachments to
Answer, pages 1-5.) During the December 2017 PSI, he told the investigator that he fell
behind on child-support payments while he was hospitalized and unable to work. He told
the  investigator  that  he  is  paying  a  total  of  $150  per  month,  which  is  automatically
deducted from his pay. He is making no progress, because his credit reports reflect that
2 The SOR alleges that he was sentenced to imprisonment for three years, suspended, and probation for
three years.
the amount of arrearage is increasing. He told an investigator that he expects to be paying
the arrearage for the rest of his life. (FORM Item 6 at 7.)
SOR ¶ 2.c: telecommunications bill placed for collection of $431. During the
December  2017  PSI,  Applicant  told  an  investigator  that  this  debt  was  for  unreturned
equipment  and  that  he  had  forgotten  about  it.  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  provided
evidence of a payment agreement providing for monthly $72 payments and evidence of
payments for July through December 2018. (Answer to SOR at 6-7.) This debt is being
resolved.
SOR ¶ 2.d: credit-card account past due for $75, with a total balance of $409.
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he was making payments on this debt
under a verbal agreement to pay $50 per month. He submitted no documentation of an
agreement or any payments.
SOR ¶ 2.e: credit-union charged off for $250. During the December 2017 PSI,
Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  this  debt  was  a  “crunch  loan”  that  he  had  forgotten
about.  (FORM  Item  6  at  8.)  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  stated  that  he  was  making
weekly payments of $25. He submitted a receipt for one $25 payment in July 2018, but
no evidence of any further payments. (Answer to SOR at 8)
In  the  October  2014  PSI,  Applicant  told  a  security  investigator  that  his  financial
situation was “not very good,” and he was barely able to pay his bills on time. (FORM
Item 5 at 6.) In the December 2017 PSI, he told a security investigator that his overall
financial situation is “good,” but he provided no specific information about his income and
expenses. (FORM Item 6 at 9.)
