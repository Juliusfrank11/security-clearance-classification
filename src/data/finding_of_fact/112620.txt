Applicant is a 44-year-old mechanic for a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance.  The  allegations  covered  in  the  SOR  and  admitted  by  Applicant  are
incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant married his first wife in January 1998 and divorced her in February 1999.
(Item 3) He remarried in February 2002 and has one child from this marriage. Applicant
earned an associate’s degree in August 1996.
Applicant  enlisted  in  the  Army  in  January  1998  and  served  four  years  of  active
duty. He received his honorable discharge in January 2002. (Item 3)
Since  August  2016,  Applicant  has  worked  for  his  current  employer.  (Item  3)
Between  July  2002  and  August  2016,  he  was  employed  by  various  employers  in
mechanic positions, interspersed with brief periods of unemployment. (Item 3)
Applicant’s finances
Between  2012  and  2015,  Applicant  accumulated  two  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately $29,719. (Items 5-6)  One of the debts (SOR debt ¶ 1.a) was  a  state tax
lien that has since been resolved. (Items 2 and 4) Another listed debt (SOR debt ¶ 1.b)
was  a  delinquent  home  equity  loan  that  was  charged  off  In  December  2015  in  the
approximate  amount  of  $27,083.  (Items  5-6) This loan  has  not  been  addressed  to  date
and remains outstanding.
Besides  accruing  the  two  referenced  delinquent  debts,  Applicant  incurred  two
foreclosures: one in 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.c) and another in 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.d). The first of the
two  foreclosures  involved  a  mortgage  on  which  he  co-signed  a  note  for  $86,317  in
November  2002  to  finance  a  home  for  his  mother.  (Items  5-6)  This  mortgage  was
foreclosed  in  2014  following  family  differences  between  Applicant’s  mother  and  her
husband. Applicant could not reconcile with his mother, and she moved out of the house,
leaving the husband, who defaulted on the loan, still residing in the residence. (Items 2-6)
The  second  foreclosure  covered  a  rental  property  that  Applicant  financed  by  himself  in
2011 for $74,503 that he could no longer afford due to unemployment. (Items 2-6)
Whether either of the foreclosures ever resulted in deficiency balances is unclear.
Applicant’s  two  credit  reports  (Items  6-7)  report  zero  balances.  And,  Applicant  believes
that any delinquent debts owed creditors ¶¶ 1.c-1.d were credited in the sale. (Items 5-6)
While neither of the reported zero balances are dispositive without more information in the
credit  reports  to  establish  payment  histories  and  produced  sales  proceeds  from  the
foreclosures,  they  are  enough  in  Applicant’s  case  to  draw  favorable  inferences  that  the
underlying debts were resolved by foreclosure.
To  date,  Applicant  has  failed  to  document  any  progress  in  addressing  his
delinquent SOR ¶ 1.b debt. Absent proof of payment, or payment plan, of the home equity
loan covered by SOR ¶ 1.b, no favorable inferences can be drawn regarding Applicant’s
addressing of this debt.
