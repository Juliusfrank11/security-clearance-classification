Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except for ¶¶ 1.m – 1.p, which she
denied.  The  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  52  years  old.  She  has  worked  for  a  government  contractor  since
February  2016.  From  1996  to  2015  she  worked  full  time  for  a  different  federal
contractor. She is married for the second time and has two step-children.1
The SOR alleged 20 delinquent debts totaling approximately $30,000. The debts
are  comprised  of  charged-off  and  collections  accounts  (automobile  repossession
deficiency,  credit  cards,  consumer  debts,  telecommunication  debts,  and  a  medical
debt). The debts are supported by credit reports from September 2016 and May 2018,
her  statement  to  an  investigator  in  January  2018,  and  her  SOR  admissions  in  her
answer from August 2018.2
Applicant  attributes  her  financial  problems  to  her  underemployment  resulting
from  the  loss  of  a  major  defense  contract  by  her  employer  in  2015.  Her  income  was
reduced from approximately $98,000 in 2015 to $24,567 in 2016, and to $3,797 in 2017.
Applicant contacted an attorney to file a bankruptcy case, but as of September 2018, no
case  had  been  filed.  Aside  from  using  the  bankruptcy  process  to  have  her  debts
discharged,  Applicant  has  taken  no  other  action  to  pay  or  otherwise  resolve  the  SOR
debts. Applicant’s debts remain unresolved.3
