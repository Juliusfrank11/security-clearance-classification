Applicant is 34 years old. He obtained his general equivalency diploma (GED) in
2002  and  his  master  welder’s  license  in  2007.  Applicant  has  been  employed  as  a
master welder by a federal contractor since 2017. He reports no military service and he
married in May 2016. Applicant has two daughters, age 3 months, and 10 years old. In
section 22 (Police Record) of his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86)
or  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  he  disclosed  an  arrest  for  driving  under  the
influence  (DUI)  in  July  2012.  He  pled  guilty  to  a  reduced  charge  of  reckless  driving  in
April  2013. He  completed probation and  community  service;  paid  fines and  costs;  and
attended  mandatory,  court-ordered  DUI-counseling  sessions  one  day  each  week  from
April to October 2013. He disclosed another arrest for DUI in November 2016.
The SOR alleges that Applicant was also arrested for DUI and criminal mischief
in  July  2005  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  Applicant  pled  no  contest  to  reduced  charges  of  reckless
driving  and  criminal  mischief  in  October  2005,  and  he  was  sentenced  to  one  year
probation  and  ordered  to  complete  a  DUI  level  one  program.  Applicant  admitted  all  of
the  allegations  in  the  SOR  in  his  answer  to  the  SOR  in  July  2018.  (Item  3)  He  also
admitted  to  five  other  driving  offenses  including:  driving  while  license  suspended  in
2006, 2008, and 2017 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.e, and 1.i) and driving in violation of court-ordered
license  restrictions  in  2007  and  2013  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.g).  Additionally,  Applicant
admitted being charged with possession of drug paraphernalia in January 2007. (SOR ¶
1.c)  State  court  records  provided  by  Department  Counsel  corroborate  Applicant’s
admissions and confirm his multiple criminal offenses. (Items 6 – 7)
In his personal subject interview (PSI), Applicant stated that his latest November
2016 DUI occurred after he had dinner and three beers with friends and he was pulled
over  by  police.  Applicant’s  blood  alcohol  content  (BAC)  was  .09  and  the  state  law
threshold  for  DUI  is  .08  BAC.  Again,  he  paid  fines  and  $2,000  in  court  costs  plus  25
hours of community service, and one year probation. He completed mandatory alcohol
abuse  counseling  in  January  2018,  and  his  license  was  revoked  for  one  year.
Nonetheless,  Applicant  continued  to  drive  since  he  needed  to  get  to  work  and  felt  he
had  no  other  choice.  In  2007,  when  he  was  charged  with  possession  of  marijuana,  it
was  provided  to  him  at  a  party.  He  never  purchased  or  sold  marijuana,  and  claims  to
have used it only this one time. (Item 5, pp. 20-21)
Applicant denied the cross-alleged violations under Guidelines G and E, at SOR
¶¶  2  and  3.  He  ascribes  his  afore-mentioned  mistakes  to  youthful  immaturity  in  his
answer  to  the  SOR.  He  professes  his  intent  to  not  re-offend.  Applicant  provided  no
response  to  the  FORM  or  character  references  or  performance  evaluations.  He
provided no documentary evidence that he attends treatment or Alcoholics Anonymous
(AA) or other support groups, or that he has acknowledged his longstanding pattern of

abstinence from alcohol.
