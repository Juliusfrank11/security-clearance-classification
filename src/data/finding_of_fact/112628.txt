application in June 2016. He has not previously held a security clearance. (GE 1)
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  2004  and  attended  a  technical  school,
earning  a  degree  in  aviation  in  2011.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  as  an

Financial
The  SOR  ¶¶1.a-1.i  allege  two  child  support  collection  accounts;  four  collection
accounts;  one  charged-off  medical  account,  and  an  amended  state  tax  debt  for  about
$1,600. Applicant claimed that he has been paying his child support (deduction from his
pay check) and several other accounts. He stated that all his financial documents were
lost in a car accident in the spring. (Tr. 12)
Applicant  attributes  the  debts  to  his  overextending  himself  while  trying  to  take
care of his family. He explained that he decided to put off some creditors to pay others.
He  realizes  that  a  better approach  would  have  been  to  contact  the  creditors and  work
out  an  agreement.  (GE)  2  He  stated  that  he  has  reduced  his  spending  habits  and
concentrates  on  his  expenses.  Applicant  now  earns  about  $65,000  a  year,  which
depends  on  overtime.  He  is  paid  hourly.  (Tr.  38)  He  has  no  savings  and  little  in  his
checking account. He lives with his mother, and pays $100 a month in rent. (Tr. 39) He
uses his girlfriend’s car and pays the car insurance. (Tr. 71) He has not obtained credit
counseling. (Tr.57) He does not follow a budget.
As  to  SOR  1.a  ($13,000)  and  1.b  ($2,677),  Applicant  admitted  that  he  was
delinquent in child support, but explained that $432 is automatically deducted from his
pay  each  month.  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  stated  that  he  did  not  pay  attention  and
money  was  not  deducted  for  child  support  in  2004  to  2008.  (Tr.  29-33)  He  does  not
know what the correct balances on his child support cases are at this time. (Tr. 36)
SOR  1.c  is  a  wireless  collection  account  in  the  amount  of  $2,213.  Applicant
stated  that  he  is  now  making  payments  in  the  amount  of  $50  a  month.  (GE  2)  He
submitted one document that showed $50 was debited from his bank account on June
18, 2019. He stated at the hearing that he has a $400 balance, and he claims that he
started paying in 2016. (Tr. 21, 43)
As  to  SOR  1.d,  a  collection  account  in  the  amount  of  $1,742,  for  a  security
system, Applicant intends to pay the amount due on the account, but he has not had the
money to do so yet. (Tr. 22)
SOR  1.e  is  a  medical  account  in  collection  for  $828.  He  has  not  made  any
payments on the account. He believes that the bill was for hospital visits.
SOR 1.f is a charged-off account in the amount of $455. He stated at the hearing
that he is paying $50 a month. (Tr. 23) He submitted no documentation. During his 2017
OPM interview, he stated that he would contact the creditor and make arrangements to
pay the account in full. (GE 2)
SOR 1.g is a collection account for the same debt that is listed in 1.d. However,
the  amount  is  $296.  He  stated  that  he  would  pay  when  he  was  able.  (Tr.  23)  He
believes they were two separate accounts. (GE 2)
As to SOR 1. h, a collection account for $600, Applicant stated that it has been
paid.  (Tr.  24)  He  submitted  documentation  that  reflected  a  payment  of  $25  that  was
made on October 6, 2018, showing a balance of $149.32. During his 2017 investigative
interview, he noted that there were two different accounts and that he cannot remember
which one he has paid in full.
The amended SOR 1.i represents a paper that Applicant brought to the hearing.
It is a letter dated November 21, 2018, showing a payment agreement for state taxes.
The payment plan was established for a period of 16 months paying $105.63 a month.
(GE  6)  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  explained  that  he  has  been  paying  every  month.  (Tr.
53) He had no documentation to support his claim.
Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse
The SOR alleges under AG ¶¶ 2.a-2.b that Applicant purchased marijuana on or
about October 2017, and information set below under criminal conduct.
SOR  2.a  alleges  and  Applicant  admits  that  he  purchased  marijuana  in  October
2017.  He  explained  that  he  was  buying  the  marijuana  for  his  girlfriend.  He  was
instructed to stop at a rest stop off a major highway, where he purchased the marijuana
($60) for his friend. (Tr. 58) As he was driving home, he was stopped by a police officer
for tinted windows. (GE 2, Tr. 62) The officer searched the car and found the marijuana
in the glove compartment. Applicant stated that he does not use marijuana or any illegal
drugs. (Tr. 62) Applicant received a criminal citation and made a plea agreement. (GE
5)  He  spent  a  night  in  jail.  He  has  had  this  expunged  from  his  record.  He  no  longer
associates with that friend. He understands that this was a “dumb mistake.”  He did not
report this incident to his FSO for fear of losing his job. (Tr. 64)
SOR 2.b alleges the criminal information in AG 3.a, that Applicant was charged
with  possession  of marijuana  in  October 2017. This  is the  same  incident  as  described
above under Guideline H.
Criminal Conduct
SOR AG 3.a alleges that Applicant was charged in October 2017 for possession
of marijuana. This has been discussed as cross-alleged under the above guideline.
SOR AG 3.b alleges the information as set forth in subparagraph 2.a. Again, this
is the same incident in October 2017 to which Applicant admitted.
Personal Conduct
SOR AG 4.a cross alleges the information as set forth under paragraph 2.a and
3.a  (drug  involvement  and  criminal  conduct)  as  adverse  personal  conduct  under  this
guideline. This is the same information that has been addressed above.
