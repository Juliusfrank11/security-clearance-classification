Applicant  is  58  years  old.  He  graduated from  high  school  in 1978  and obtained

Applicant  admits  he  was  arrested  in  February  2008  and  charged  with
possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  and  driving  while  impaired.  (Answer)  Applicant
testified that he sustained a devastating leg injury in 2003 and he was unable to work
through  2008.  (Tr.  51,  53,  56,  AE  E,  H)  He  had  invested  his  life  savings  in  his  small
business. Since he had no insurance, he lost everything. (Answer) He was attempting to
rebuild  his  business  and  facilitate  investors,  when  he  went  out  with  an  associate  who
used drugs. (Tr. 57-58) They had a beer together and then the associate drove them to
a house party where the associate and others used cocaine. Applicant testified credibly
he  did  not  use  cocaine  that  evening;  although  he  did  use  it  previously  following  his
injury. (Tr. 67)  He wanted to leave the party. (Tr. 58)  His associate said “take my keys”
and  Applicant  drove  away.  He  was  stopped  by  police  and  admitted  to  having  a  beer.

sentenced  to  three  years’  probation,  court  costs,  and  a  fine.  (Tr.  64-66)  In  section  22

probation officer that he needed to travel to an upstate location. (Tr. 69) She responded
that he should just check in with her when he returned. (Tr. 71) When Applicant spent
more time upstate than he intended, he realized he was going to be late returning. (Tr.
72) He called to advise the probation officer of this delay. She nonetheless reported the

Applicant  admits  that  he  was  stopped  by  police  in  July  2008  and  charged  with
unlicensed  operation  of  a  vehicle,  running  a  red  light,  and  driving  an  unregistered
vehicle.  SOR  ¶  1.b  was  amended  at  the  outset  of  the  hearing  to  reflect  that  he  was
“stopped” by police and not “arrested.” (Tr. 11-12) Applicant admits to the allegation as
amended. He received a citation and failed to appear in court. He has paid all fees and
fines associated with that traffic stop, and the warrant that issued (for failure to appear)
has  been  rescinded  in  September  2018.  (Tr.  85,  AE  A,  F)  Applicant  states  that  2008
was a bad year and he struggled with depression as a result of his crippling injury and
loss of his business. (Tr. 15, 67) He later treated with a clinical master social worker in
2016. (Tr. 91-92)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  was  also  arrested  for  driving  while  impaired
(DWI) in March 1999. (SOR ¶ 1.d) He admits to this offense twenty years ago, and he
pled  guilty  and  paid  all  fines  and  court  costs  associated  with  it.  (Tr.  53-55)  He  also
admits  that  he  was  arrested  in  April  2017  for  DWI  as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.  Applicant
testified that he was very ill and suffering from bronchitis and allergies at the time. (Tr.

he was pulled over, he was unsteady on his feet due to the devastating injury. (Tr. 102)
He  took  a  breathalyzer  that  registered  zero  blood-alcohol  content.  (Tr.  104)  He  was
found  guilty  of  failure  to  use  due  care  while  driving  since  he  was  operating  under  the
influence of cough medicine. (Tr. 105, GE 4, AE D) Applicant paid a $1,500 dollar fine.
(Tr. 107)
Applicant  last  used  illegal  drugs  in  2008.  (Tr.  114)  He  drinks  only  on  rare
occasions.  (Tr.  116)  Applicant  presented  testimony  from  his  supervisor  of  the  fleet

work ethic and character, and testified that Applicant is honest, trustworthy, and reliable.

previous attorney attesting to the fact that he resolved all outstanding traffic violations in
state A and all fines were paid in 2015. (AE C, G) Applicant admitted the cross-alleged
violations  under  Guidelines  E  and  G,  at  SOR  ¶¶  2  and  3,  and  provides  the  same
explanations as above.
