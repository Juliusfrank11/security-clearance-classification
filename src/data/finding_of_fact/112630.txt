Applicant  is  a  31-year-old  information  technology  (IT)  consultant  for  a  defense
contractor  who  seeks  a  security  clearance.  The  allegations  covered  in  the  SOR  and
admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings
follow.
Background
Applicant never married and has no children. (GE 1) He attended college classes
in the Ukraine between August 2010 and June 2014 and earned a bachelor’s degree in
June 2014 in computer engineering. (GE 1) He immigrated to the United States in 2005
and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in March 2012. (GEs 1-3) Applicant reported no
military service.
Since April 2012, Applicant has been self-employed as an IT consultant. (GE 1)
Contemporaneously  with  his  self-employment  as  an  IT  consultant  (since  September
2017),  he  has  worked  as  a  Russian  interpreter  for  a  Russian  linguist  firm.  (GE  1)
Between October 2011 and August 2013, he worked as an IT team lead for an IT firm.
(GE  1)  He  reported  self-employment  as  an  IT  consultant  between  April  2007  and  April
2010. (GEs 1-3)
Employment termination
Records  confirm  that  Applicant  was  terminated  from  his  employment  with  a
defense  contractor  (Company  A)  in  May  2015  on  the  stated  grounds  that  he  had  an
inappropriate relationship with a subordinate, in violation of company policy. (AE A; Tr.
25-26) His termination and reasons are summarized in an email forwarded to him in May
2015 by his manager. (AE A) as follows: (a) Applicant was found to have engaged in a
“significant  personal  relationship  with  another  employee,  resulting  in  a  conflict  of
interest,” and (b) he failed to notify his human resource office or his manager about the
existence of the conflict of interest. (AE A; Tr. 26-27)
Applicant  never  denied  the  cited  bases  of  his  termination.  Applicant  worked  for
Company  A  between  June  2013  and  May  2015,  and  was  fired  over  his  engaging  in  a
personal romantic relationship with a coworker. (GEs 1 and 3 and AE A; Tr. 25-26)
Drug use
Applicant  admitted,  and  records  confirmed  that  he  used  marijuana  in  October
2011 and in December 2013. (GE 3) He self-reported in his PSI that he used medically
prescribed cannabis oil in 2017 on 10 to 15 occasions. (GEs 2-3) There is no evidence in
the record to indicate he used marijuana on any other occasions.
E-QIP omissions
Asked  to  complete  an  e-QIP  in  October  2017,  Applicant  falsified  the  form  by
omitting  his termination  from  his  employment  with  Company  A  in  May  2015.  (GE  1)  In
answering questions posed in section 13A of his 2017 e-QIP, Applicant answered “Left
by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct” and explained the
misconduct charges to mean engaging in a personal relationship resulting in a conflict of
interest.  (GE  1)  At  no  point  in  the  e-QIP  Applicant  completed  in  2017  did  he
acknowledge his being fired or terminated from Company A in May 2015 as the result in
his engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a coworker. (GEs 1 and 3 and AE A;
Tr. 30-33)
In the same October 2017 e-QIP, Applicant omitted his prior drug use in October
2010 and again in December 2013, when responding to questions posed in section 23
about  illegal  use  of  drugs  or  controlled  substances.  (GE  1)  Asked  about  past  use  of
illegal drugs, Applicant disclosed his being examined by a medical provider for help with
his  sleep  and  being  furnished  a  medical  marijuana  card,  which  he  used  to  purchase
marijuana around 10-15 times in August 2017. (GE 1) He provided no further information
about his past marijuana use in 2010 and 2013, either in section 23 or in the additional
comment section of the e-QIP. (GE 1)
In  a  follow-up  PSI  conducted  by  an  investigator  from  OPM  in  November  2017,
Applicant  failed  again  to  disclose  both  his  firing  due  to  his  having  an  inappropriate
relationship with another employee and his past use of marijuana in October 2010 and
December  2013.  (GE  2)  In  his  PSI,  he  acknowledged  only  that  he  told  the  OPM
investigator  that  he  (a)  resigned  in  lieu  of  being  fired  and  (b)  he  used  prescribed
marijuana in 2017 as a sleep aid on 10 to 15 occasions. (GE 2; Tr. 32-33, 40)
Nowhere in Applicant’s  2017  OPM interview did he disclose his being fired from
Company  A  due  to  his  having  a  personal  relationship  with  another  employee  without
reporting it to his human resources department or manager, or that he used marijuana in
2010 and 2013. (GE 3 and AE A) Basically, he stuck to the same story he furnished in
his earlier 2017 e-QIP. (GEs 1-2)
In December 2017, Applicant completed a counterintelligence security screening
questionnaire. (GE 2) In this questionnaire, Applicant admitted his firing from a previous
employer for having an inappropriate relationship with another employee.
Under  questioning  by  the  screening  investigator,  Applicant  admitted  to  not
disclosing in his e-QIP his being fired from Company A for engaging in an inappropriate
relationship with a coworker, in violation of company policy. (GE 2 and AE A) Applicant
attributed his disclosure failures to his believing that leaving his Company A employment
by mutual agreement sounded better than being fired. (GE 2 and AE A; Tr. 41-42).
Still, Applicant’s explanations for his omissions of his being fired instead of leaving
by  mutual  agreement  and  his  understating  his  marijuana  use,  both  individually  and
collectively, reflect a lack of candor. His explanations, while they reflected his reasoning
at  the  time  behind  his  employment  termination  omissions,  document  and  confirm  his
knowing  and  wilful  omissions  of  material  information  needed  to  develop  background
information pertinent to a determination of his eligibility to hold a security clearance.
On the strength of the evidence developed in the record, inferences are warranted
that  Applicant’s  omissions  and  understatements  about  the  circumstances  of  his
departure from Company A and the extent of his past marijuana use in 2010 and 2013
when completing his 2017 e-QIP were both knowing and wilful, and were left uncorrected
in his ensuing PSI. Considering all of the circumstances surrounding his omissions and
understatements, inferences are warranted of a material lack of candor by Appellant in
his  omitting  and  misstating  the  circumstances  surrounding  his  Company  A  termination
and  the  dates  of  his  use  of  marijuana  in  2010  and  2013  when  completing  his  2017  e-
QIP.
Adverse inferences are warranted as well in connection with his failure to provide
full and accurate accounts of his Company A termination and more extensive marijuana
use  when  responding  to  OPM  investigator  questions  in  his  ensuing  PSI.  Appellant’s
corrected  admissions  of  his  termination  from  Company  A  and  more  extensive  use  of
marijuana  were  not  provided  until  questioned  by  an  investigator  assigned  to  interview
him in a subsequent counterintelligence screening questionnaire.
Endorsements
Applicant  did  not  provide  any  personal  endorsements  from  his  supervisors  and
coworkers.  Nor  did  he  provide  any  performance  evaluations,  character  references,  nor
evidence of community contributions.
