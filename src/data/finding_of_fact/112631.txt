Applicant is a 47-year-old quality auditor employed by a defense contractor since
April  2017.  (Item  3)  She  seeks  a  security  clearance  in  conjunction  with  her  current
employment.
Applicant  graduated from high  school in 1990,  and attended  junior  college from
1990  to  1992,  but  did  not  earn  a  degree.  She  married  her  current  husband  in  2013.
Applicant  was  previously  married  two  times,  and  both  of  those  marriages  ended  by
divorce. She has two adult stepchildren. (Item 3)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s  SOR  lists 15  allegations  -- failure  to file her 2015  and  2016  Federal
income tax returns, a $2,000 debt to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes, and
13  delinquent  consumer  accounts  totaling  $23,904.  In  her  SOR  Answer,  Applicant
admits  each  of  the  allegations.  These  allegations  are  further  established  by  her
November  2017  and  May  2018  credit  reports,  as  well  as  by  her  Office  of  Personnel
Management Personal Subject Interviews (OPM PSI) conducted in February and March
2018. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.o.; Items 1, 2, 4, 5, 6)
In  Applicant’s  SOR  Answer,  she  claimed  that  she  was  “actively  resolving  [her]
debts,” and had hired a tax preparation company to file all of her back taxes. She also
stated that her 2014 Federal income tax returns were ready to file. Her failure to file her
2014 Federal income returns was not alleged in the SOR. (Item 2)
Department  Counsel  noted  that  Applicant  claimed  that  she  filed  her  2015  and
2016 Federal income tax returns and that a $2,100 consumer debt was current. He also
noted  that  Applicant  failed  to  provide  any  documentary  evidence  that  her  Federal
income tax returns were filed, nor had she provided any documentary evidence that her
$2,000 in unpaid taxes or her remaining 13 consumer accounts had been paid, were the
subject of a payment plan, or were otherwise settled or resolved.
Applicant explained that she did not file her 2015  and 2016 Federal income tax
returns  because  she  was  working  as  a  contractor  in  Kuwait  and  was  waiting  until  she
returned  to  the  United  States  to  file  her  returns  with  a  tax  preparer  familiar  with  filing
taxes  on  U.S.  derived  income  while  employed  in  a  foreign  country.  Applicant  was
employed  overseas  from  December  2015  to  April  2017.  Applicant  stated  that  she
incurred estimated penalties of $2,200 for filing her 2016 returns after the due date and
had  set  up  a  payment  plan  with  the  IRS.  (Items  2,  4)  During  her  OPM  PSI,  Applicant
stated that she would set up a payment plan by August 2018 to address her remaining
SOR debts. (Item 4)
Applicant’s  FORM  response  contained  documentation  dated  March  5,  2018,
showing  that  her  2015  and  2016  Federal  income  tax  returns  had  been  filed,  with  her
receiving respective refunds of $3,741 and $1,337. (Item 7) In that same response, she
submitted  documentation  that  her  first  $250  installment  had  been  debited  from  her
checking account towards her $2,000 delinquent tax debt on October 9, 2018. (Item 7).
It is unclear from the record why Applicant’s refunds were not applied to her delinquent
tax debt.
Department  Counsel’s  FORM  discussed  specific  shortcomings  of  Applicant’s
SOR answer, and emphasized long-standing DOHA case law concerning the necessity
for  applicants  to  provide  mitigating  documentation.  Except  as  discussed  above,
Applicant’s  SOR  Answer  and  FORM  Response  contained  no  documentation  that
addressed her remaining SOR debts.
Applicant concluded her response to the FORM by stating that her personal debt
had  not  compromised  her  integrity  to  hold  a  security  clearance  and  that  she  had  not
engaged in any illegal or questionable acts to generate funds nor had she had sources
of unknown income. (Item 7)
