The SOR alleges that Applicant’s uncle (SOR 1.a) and her friend (SOR 1.b) are
residents  of  Pakistan.  Applicant  admitted  both  allegations  with
citizens  and
explanations. She requested a hearing.
Applicant  is  36  years  old.  She  married  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  December
2016.  He  has  worked  for  a  U.S.  federal  agency  since  2011  and  has  a  security
clearance.  She  received  her  bachelor’s  degree  in  April  2005  (psychology)  and  two
master’s  degrees  in  May  2007  (psychology)  and  May  2011  (mass  communications).
She has been working for a defense contractor as a research analyst since September
2013. She received a promotion to a principal analyst in 2016, and is being considered
for a position as task leader. She held a security clearance from 2012 to August 2014,
when the clearance was “disapproved.” (GE 1 at 9-45, 60-61; Answer to SOR; AE A; Tr.
22-26, 31-32, 37)
SOR 1.a – Applicant’s uncle is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. He is a doctor
(pulmonologist)  in  the  Pakistan  Military  Medical  Corps.  This  individual  is  actually
Applicant’s  mother’s  cousin,  not  her  uncle.  Applicant  explained  that  growing  up  in  the
Pakistani  culture  one  refers  to  older  relatives  as  an  aunt  or  uncle.  When  Applicant
started filling out security applications, she continued to refer to her mother’s cousin as
uncle. He served as a doctor for the Pakistan Military Medical Corps from the 1990s to
about 2012, then he moved to another country for additional training for about a year. In
2013,  he  returned  to  the  Pakistan  Military  Medical  Corps  because  Applicant  testified
that he has been in the Corps for about 20 years. Her contact with him is four times a
year through social media and phone. Her last face-to-face contact with him was in April
2017, when she lodged at his home for a couple of days. Applicant sent an email to him
in November 2018. He has never asked Applicant about her job or information relating
to her job. (GE 1 at 42-43; GE 2 at 28, 37; GE 3 at 1; answer to SOR; Tr. 44, 46-47, 54-
56)
SOR 1.b – Applicant’s friend is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. She is one of
Applicant’s  closest  friends  since  high  school  (circa  1996).  She  is  employed  as  a
teacher. As of May 2016, Applicant was contacting her friend about four to five times a
year.  The  friend  came  to  the  United  States  in  2012  for  medical  treatment.  During  her
stay, the friend resided with her sister in another state. Applicant last spoke to her friend
about six months before the hearing. (GE 1 at 43-44; GE 3 at 2; answer to SOR; Tr. 56-
59)
Applicant’s mother is 58 years old. She is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and lives in
another state. She is employed as a mental health clinician. (GE 1 at 35-36; GE 3 at 1;
Tr. 33)
Applicant’s  father  is  69  years  old  and  is  a  Pakistani  citizen,  who  resides  in  the
United States. In a May 2016 signed affidavit, Applicant indicated to an investigator from
the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  that  she  was  unaware  of  her  father’s
location due to her parents’ divorce in approximately 2001. Her last social media contact
with  him  was  in  2009,  when  they  discussed  her  brother’s  personal  problems.  While  in
Pakistan, her father was employed by a pharmaceutical company. In the United States,
he was driving a taxi. (GE 1 at 36-37; GE 3 at 1)
Applicant’s  30-year-old  brother,  a  lawyer,  is  a  citizen  of  Pakistan  living  in  the
United  States  in  another  state.  In  December  2017,  she  did  not  know  his  citizenship
status and was estranged from him for about seven years. Applicant did not believe that
her brother was affiliated with any foreign government. (GE 1 at 38-39)
Applicant’s father-in-law and mother-in-law are naturalized U.S. citizens living in
another  state.  (GE  2  at  4)  Applicant’s  husband  has  several  relatives  (not  listed  in  the
SOR) who are citizens and residents of Bangladesh. These persons are identified in the
relatives’ matrix in her January 2018 answers to interrogatories (GE 2 at 9-18). Neither
Applicant nor her husband have had any contact with the first nine relatives since 1992.
(GE 2 at 9-12) Applicant or her husband expect to contact the tenth relative every two or
three years by email and phone, with their last contact occurring in 2017. (GE 2 at 12)
The last contact with the relative listed at number 11 was in 1985. There has been no
contact with the 12th relative. (GE 2 at 12) The last contact with the next eight relatives
was  in  1992.  (GE  2  at  13-15) The  last  contact  with  her husband’s 21st  and  22nd  listed
relative was in 2016, with future contact expected to occur once every ten years. (GE 2
at  16)  The  last  contact  with  the  23rd  relative  was  in  2016,  with  no  expected  future
contact. They have had no contact with the 24rd relative. Applicant or her husband’s last
contact with his 25th relative was in 2016, with no contact since. (GE 2 at 17) Their last
contact with the 26th relative was in 2017, with future  contacts expected to occur once
every  10  years.  Neither Applicant  nor her husband have  had  any contact  with  the  last
four  relatives  listed.  (GE  2  at  17-18)  From  the  30  relatives  listed  on  the  matrix,
Applicant’s  only  recent  contact  was  with  the  10th  and  26th  relative.  Applicant  or  her
husband’s last contact with the tenth relative was in 2017, with the frequency of  future
contact occurring once every two to three years. The last contact with the 26th relative
was also in 2017, with the frequency of expected future contact expected to occur once
every  10  years.  None  of  Applicant  or  her  husband’s  relatives  are  in  a  position  to  be
exploited  by  a  foreign  power  that  could  force  Applicant  or  her  husband  to  choose
between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States. (GE 2 at 9-18, 31)
Neither  Applicant  nor  her  husband  have  any  financial  interests  in  a  foreign
country.  They  do  not  receive  any  income  from  a  foreign  government  or  entity.
Conversely,  they  do  not  owe  money  or  have  a  legal  obligation  to  any  foreign
government or entity. If Applicant suspects someone is trying to exploit her or influence
her  through  her family  member,  or  in  any  other fashion,  she  will  resist  and  refuse  the
efforts to influence her and report the attempt to her facility security officer (FSO) or the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), should the situation require that action. (GE 2 at
22-26, 30; Tr. 51-52)
Applicant’s  financial  interests  in  the  United  States  include  a  home  she  and  her
husband purchased  in  November 2018 for approximately  $572,000.  According  to  their
personal  financial  statement  (PFS),  dated  February  11,  2019,  their  combined  monthly
income  was  $10,600.  Their  assets  totaled  $1,092,000.  Their  combined  monthly
expenses  were  $7,000,  with  a  monthly  remainder  of  $3,600.  Applicant  is  a  registered
U.S. voter. (AE J; AE K1-K4; AE L)

Administrative Notice – Pakistan
Pakistan  is  a  parliamentary  Islamic  republic  with  significant  internal  problems
caused  by  terrorist  organizations  concentrated  in  several  locations  within  the  country.
As  of  2014,  parts  of  Pakistan’s  Federally  Administered  Tribal  Areas,  Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa  province,  and  Balochistan  province  were  regarded  as  a  safe  haven  for
terrorist  groups,  including  al-Qaeda,  the  Haqqani  Network,  Tehrik-e  Taliban  Pakistan,
Lasahkar  I  Jhangvi,  and  the  Afghan  Taliban.  These  groups  create  ongoing  security
problems by targeting western interests, U.S. citizens, senior Pakistani officials, minority
political  groups,  and  religious  entities.  In  September  2012,  the  United  States  officially
declared  the  Haqqani  Network  a  foreign  terrorist  organization.  Operations  in  2014  by
the Pakistani military against some of the terror groups had only marginal success.
The  human  rights  record  of  Pakistan  is  not  good.  Extrajudicial  killings,  torture,
and  disappearances have  been  reported,  along  with  intrusive  government  surveillance
of  politicians,  political  activists,  and  the  media.  Government  and  police  corruption,
sexual  harassment,  and  gender  discrimination  are  persistent  problems.  Pakistani
government authorities seldom punish government officials for human rights violations.
Polices
When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability
the
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which
are flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of
the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a
decision.  The  protection  of  the  national  security  is  the  paramount  consideration.  AG  ¶
2(b)  requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  national
security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
for  a  security  clearance,
Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish
controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses  and  other  evidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate,
or  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.  .  .  .”  The
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.
