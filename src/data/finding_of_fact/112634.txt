Applicant  admitted  six  SOR  allegations  and  denied  the  remaining  three.  Her
admissions  are incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings
and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 61-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for
this contractor for approximately  14 years. She served honorably in the U.S. Army and
retired in 1997 after 20 years in the grade of sergeant first class (E-7). She has held a
security  clearance  for  over  40  years.  She  has  a  high  school  diploma  and  has  taken
some  college  courses.  She  is  currently  married.  She  has  been  married  four  times
previously. She has two adult children.1
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  had  a  foreclosed  mortgage  account;  a  past-due
account in the amount of approximately $31,890; five charged-off or collection accounts
totaling approximately  $4,269; and two delinquent medical accounts totaling $104. The
debts were listed in a credit report from January 2017. Credit reports from August 2018
and March 2019 show no delinquent debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.i).2
Applicant credibly explained that her financial problems occurred during the 2008
to  2011  timeframe  when  she  was  married  to  her  fourth  husband  (H4).  Applicant’s  job
required  frequent  lengthy  travel  away  from  home.  When  she  was  away  during  her
marriage to H4, he told her he was paying the mortgage payment for their home, which
at some point became rental property. They initially used a realtor to lease and manage
this  property.  H4  neglected  to  tell  Applicant  that  he  fired  the  realtor  and  began
managing the rental property himself. He neglected to pay the mortgage payments on
the  property  and  failed  to  supervise  the  tenants  who  severely  damaged  the  property.
Eventually, the property went through foreclosure. Applicant was unaware the property
was in jeopardy until the foreclosure proceedings. The property had a second mortgage,
which also  became delinquent while H4 was managing the property. Neither mortgage
holder  has  sought  a  deficiency  judgment  against  Applicant  since  the  foreclosure  in
2010.  Applicant  sought  and  was  granted  a  divorce  against  H4  in  2011.  There  is  no
evidence showing that she had any financial difficulties before she married or after she
divorced  H4.  Applicant  recently  purchased  a  home  and  is  current  on  her  monthly
payments.3
1 Tr. at 16-18, 21-22, 29; GE 1, 2.
2 GE 3-5.
3 Tr. at 18, 20-21, 23-26; GE 4-5.
Applicant documented that she paid the SOR debts listed in ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and
1.f  in  July  2018.  Those  debts  are  resolved.  She  also  documented  her  dispute  of  SOR
debts ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h by showing that she was covered by medical insurance and would
not have incurred those debts. As for SOR debt ¶ 1.d, Applicant credibly stated that she
contacted  the  creditor  and  they  could  not  find  that  she  owed  on  a  debt.  This  is
confirmed  by  the  absence  of  any  debt  listing  on  the  latest  two  credit  reports.  Those
debts are resolved.4
In  addition  to  her  credit  reports  showing  no  delinquent  debts  and  her  recent
home  purchase,  Applicant  also  has  a  retirement  account  valued  at  approximately
$100,000. This supports her testimony that she is in good financial standing.5
