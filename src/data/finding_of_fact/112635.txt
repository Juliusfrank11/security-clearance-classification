Applicant is a 58-year-old man who has been married for 23 years. He was married
previously from 1983 to 1986. The marriage ended in divorce. For the past three years, he
has been working for a telecommunications company, as a network systems manager. (Tr.

Between  January  and  February  of  2015,  Applicant  used  his  personal  e-mail
account, which he accessed through his work computer, to solicit sexual acts via Craigslist.
On one occasion, Applicant attached to his solicitation an electronically-transmitted photo
of  himself  that  he  described  as  sexually  explicit.  In  May  2015,  Applicant’s  employer
discovered these illicit online communications. Shortly thereafter, he was terminated.
Applicant completed a security clearance application in October 2015, when he
applied for his current job. He admitted that he was terminated, but stated that he was
terminated for buying and selling things on eBay and Craigslist while at work, rather than
for soliciting sex online while at work.
Applicant characterized himself as “a stupid person at the time” he misused the work
computer, and testified that such behavior will never recur. (Tr. 27) He characterized his
relationship with his wife as an open one, in which they have both had affairs over the
years. He testified that his wife is aware that he occasionally uses the internet to arrange
sexual encounters with others. (Tr. 21) She neither testified, nor provided an affidavit.
