Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  page  5.)
He has been employed with the defense contractor since November of 2016. (GX 1 at
page  15.)  As  a  result  of  the  incident  alleged  in  subparagraph  1.a.,  Applicant  “was
denied  access  to  classified  information,”  but  it  was  re-granted  in  conjunction  with  his
current duty position. (GX 1 at pages 91~92.). He is divorced, and has no children. (TR
at page 12 line 21 to page 15 line 14.)
Guideline M - Use of Information Technology & Guideline E - Personal Conduct
1.a.  and  2.a    Applicant,  while  a  member  of  the  U.S.  Air  Force,  intentionally
misused his administrative rights access to a U.S. Government administrative computer
account to log into his then wife’s personal storage files, on two to three occasions, from
about December of 2015 to February of 2016. He suspected that she was engaging in
on-line  infidelity.  (TR  at  page  36  line  2  to  page  42  line  12,  and  at  page  52  line  12  to
page  55  line  7,  and  AppX  K.)  Applicant  self-reported  this error  in  judgment.  (Id.)  This,
coupled with an October 2, 2015, Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) incident,
which  will  be  discussed  under  Paragraph  3,  below,  resulted  in  Applicant  being
separated  from  the  Air  Force.  (TR  at  page  17  line  12  to  page  21  line  7.)  His  former
spouse,  a  member  of  the  U.S.  Air  Force,  supports  Applicant’s  security  clearance
retention request. (AppX O.)
Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption
3.a.  Applicant  admits  that  he  was  cited  in  1999  for  possession  of  alcohol  by  a
minor. (Answer2 at page 1.)
3.b.  Applicant  admits  that  in  August  of  2005,  he  was  charged  with  a  DUI.  The
charges  were  later  dismissed  in  accordance  with  a  plea  bargain,  which  included
Applicant’s  agreement  to  join  the  U.S.  Air  Force  and  graduate  from  basic  training
without further incident. (Answer2 at page 1.)
3.c.,  3.d.,  3.e.  and  3.f.  As  noted  above,  in  October  of  2015,  Applicant  received
non-judicial punishment for a second DUI. (TR at page 21 line 8 to page 26 line 20, and
GX  3.)  As  a  result,  Applicant  attended  3~5  mandatory  out-patient  Alcohol  and  Drug
Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) counseling/treatment sessions from October
to  November  of  2015.  However,  as  the  result  of  a  relapse  in  December  of  2015,
Applicant self-referred himself back to ADAPT, where he was diagnosed as an alcohol
abuser. He completed this counseling in July of 2016. Applicant last consumed alcohol
to the point of intoxication in June of 2019, about two months prior to his hearing. (TR at
page 25 lines 21~25.)
Applicant  is  well  respected  in  the  work  place  as  evidenced  by  seven  character
references. (AppX A.)
