Unless  otherwise  indicated  by  citation  to  another  part  of  the  record,  I  have
extracted these findings of fact from Applicant’s SOR answer (Item 2) and his 2015 SCA
(Item 3).
Applicant, age 38, is unmarried without children. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in
2003 and served on active duty through at least 2015. During his service, he deployed to
Iraq  three  times.  The  record  does  not  specify  when  or  under  what  conditions  he
separated. The record also does not specify for how long he has worked for his current
defense-contractor  employer.  He  was  granted  DOD  security  clearances  in  2003  and
2011. (Item 3; Item 5 at 4 and 6).
The  SOR  alleged  four  incidents  of  Applicant’s  excessive  alcohol  consumption,
involving two Non-Judicial Punishments (NJP) under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of
Military Justice, in 2003 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.b); and two Driving Under the
Influence of Alcohol (DUI) arrests, in 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.c) and 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.d). Applicant
admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c. He admitted the underlying arrest and
conviction,  but  denied  SOR  ¶  1.d  on  the  basis  that  certain  other  facts  alleged  were
incorrect.
While  on  active  duty  in  2003,  Applicant  received  NJP  for  drinking  alcohol  in
advanced  individual  training.  The  record  does  not  contain  any  other  details  about  this
incident. (Item 11 at 30).
While on active duty in 2006, Applicant became drunk and disorderly, damaged a
wall  in  an  unoccupied  room,  and  then  became  involved  in  a  verbal  altercation  which
turned physical when he pushed and choked another  soldier. He received NJP for two
offenses: (1) damage to government property, and (2) drunk and disorderly. The resultant
actions taken were a letter of concern or counseling (the record does not specify which),
a  $429  fine,  and  a  reduction  in  rank  from  E-4  to  E-3.  He  was  referred  to  an  Army-
sponsored substance abuse program, which he completed. He admitted that he became
“carried away” while drinking with his friends in the barracks that evening, having recently
returned from a deployment. He has not had any physical altercations since this incident.
(Item 5 at 4; Item 7; Item 10; Item 11 at 30 and 43).
While on active duty in 2013, Applicant consumed five or six whiskey and cokes at
a bar one night between 7:00 pm and 2:00 am. During his drive home, he was stopped
by state police at a sobriety checkpoint. After the police officer detected a strong odor of
an  alcoholic  beverage  emanating  from  Applicant’s  person,  three  standardized  field
sobriety  tests  were  administered  which  indicated  he  was  impaired.  He  was  also
administered  a  breath  test  which  measured  a  .089  breath  alcohol  content.  He  was
arrested and charged with DUI. The court later dismissed the charge due to suppression
of the evidence from the checkpoint. (Item 5 at 4-5; Item 8; Item 10).
While on active duty in 2015, Applicant consumed two beers at a softball field after
a game. While he was driving home, a civilian police officer stopped him for speeding.
After  detecting  a  moderate  odor  of  an  alcoholic  beverage  emanating  from  Applicant’s
person, the officer administered standardized field sobriety tests, which Applicant failed
to  perform  satisfactorily.  A  preliminary  breath  test  administered  during  the  arrest  also
indicated  impairment.  He  was  arrested  for  DUI.  While  being  processed  at  the  civilian
police station, Applicant gave two breath samples, which measured .138 and .137 breath
alcohol concentrations. He was then transported to the military police station, where he
was notified of the suspension or revocation (the record does not specify which)  of his
on-post driving privileges. Applicant was later convicted of DUI, and sentenced to 10 days
in jail (all but one day suspended), fined approximately $1,960, and ordered to complete
16 hours of DUI education. He completed each requirement. (Item 4; Item 5 at 5-6; Item
9; Item 10).
During a 2015 security clearance interview (SI) with a DOD authorized investigator,
Applicant described the facts and circumstances of the 2006, 2013, and 2015 incidents
and his alcohol consumption habits in general. He described himself as a social drinker,
who generally consumed approximately three beers or mixed drinks at a time. He did not
believe  that  he  had  a  drinking  problem  and  had  not  been  diagnosed  as  alcohol
dependent. He did not intend to consume any alcohol while undergoing his 16 hours of
DUI education, which consisted of classes led by a counselor. He had completed 8 hours
at  the  time  of  the  SI.  He  did  plan  to  resume  responsible  drinking  after  completing  his
hours, but professed a future intent never to drink and drive again. (Item 5 at 5-7).
In April 2016, the DOD CAF sent Applicant a SOR alleging security concerns under
Guidelines G and J (Criminal Conduct), due to three of the incidents alleged in the 2019
SOR  currently  being  adjudicated.  It  did  not  allege  the  2003  incident.  In  May  2016,
Applicant responded to the 2016 SOR. He admitted the substance, but not some of the
details,  of  the  alleged  incidents,  including  what,  if  any,  disciplinary  or  administrative
actions were taken by Applicant’s command in connection with his 2015 DUI. The record
did not specify the outcome of the adjudication of the 2016 SOR or the current status of
the DOD security clearances that he was previously granted. (Item 3; Item 5 at 6; Item 6;
Item 10).
In Applicant’s August 2018 responses to DOHA-issued interrogatories about his
alcohol  consumption,  Applicant  reported  that  he  consumed  “3-4  beers”  two  times  per
month (most recently August 2018), and “2-3 beers” two times per month (most recently
July 2018). He had not driven after consuming any amount of alcohol since his 2015 DUI.
Instead, he had either used a ride-sharing service or taken a cab. He had stopped going
to bars. He concluded his responses with the following statement: “I refuse to let alcohol
affect my life.” (Item 5 at 9-10, and 12).
In addition to the court-ordered actions Applicant took after his 2015 DUI, he also
voluntarily refrained from drinking after his softball games, attended a Mothers  Against
Drunk  Driving  victim  impact  panel,  and  completed  traffic  survival  school.  Applicant’s
response to the 2016 SOR included the statement: “I have become aware that I have let
alcohol be the reason for bad decisions. So, I have established a strong support system
with my friends and family to help me be more responsible.” He declared that with the
help of his “strong support system,” DUI incidents will not occur again. (Item 10).
