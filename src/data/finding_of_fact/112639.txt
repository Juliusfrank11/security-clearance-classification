SOR ¶ 2.b alleges in November 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with

1 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific information is available
in the cited exhibits.
2  Unless  stated  otherwise,  the  source  for  the  information  in  this  paragraph  is  Applicant’s

followed a 16-year-old girl to her apartment which was located in the same building as
the party. (Tr. 53, 90-91) At the time, he said he thought the girl he was following was an
adult. (Tr. 109) She told him he could not come inside her apartment, and he went to the
parking lot where his vehicle was located. (GE 3) He left the parking lot and he returned

The  owner of  the  apartment  where  the  party  occurred  was  cited for serving  alcohol to

SOR ¶ 2.c alleges in September 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with
Domestic  Battery-Knowing/Reckless  Bodily  Harm.  (GE  1)  The  assault  involved
Applicant’s first wife. (Tr. 30-32) Applicant had about two drinks of an alcohol beverage.

hand. (Tr. 67-68) He claimed he did not see her when he hit her with the door. (Tr. 69)
She also claimed he threw keys at her and hit her; however, he denied that the keys hit
her. (Tr. 72-74) He threatened to sell the house. (Tr. 74) The part of the OPM summary
of interview and the police report indicating he threatened to kill everyone in his home are
incorrect. (Tr. 75, 96-97; GE 3) The police arrested him, and he was issued a 72-hour
restraining  order. (Tr. 69;  GE  3)  His  spouse  wanted  Applicant  to  come home,  and  the

Applicant’s current spouse met his first spouse on one occasion at a wedding, and
his current spouse described his first spouse as aggressive and violent. (Tr. 30-32) His
current spouse observed his first spouse as she assaulted Applicant at a wedding, and
his first wife was so out of control that it was “like you see in the cartoons.” (Tr. 30-31)
SOR  ¶  2.d  alleges  in  July  2017,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Domestic  Battery-
Bodily Harm. Applicant had gone out drinking. (Tr. 97; GE 2) His current spouse took his
wallet  and  his  identification  cards  and  credit  cards.  (Tr.  98-99)  She  threw  his  wallet
outside, and she locked him out of the house. (Tr. 98; GE 3) She subsequently returned
his  identification  and  credit  cards  to  him.  (Tr.  99)  A  day  or  so  later,  Applicant  and  his
spouse were involved in a physical altercation. He said she was the aggressor, and he
was only attempting to keep her from driving his truck. (Tr. 77) His spouse hit him, and
her ring cut his face. (Tr. 78)
Applicant’s  spouse’s description  of  the  July  2017  altercation  with  Applicant  was
consistent  with  Applicant’s  description.  Applicant’s  spouse  said  that  she  and  Applicant
argued about his alcohol consumption several days before he was arrested for assault.
(Tr. 37) She took his wallet. (Tr. 37) She was anxious about when he would come home
after work. (Tr. 38-39) She said she was “yelling and screaming and lying and saying he’s
hurting  me.”  (Tr.  18)  She  said  they  had  a  “scuffle”  because  he  took  her  car  keys  and
passport and  because  she had  taken pain medication  and  consumed  alcohol.  (Tr. 18)
Her purse was in his vehicle, and it contained her passport and car keys. (Tr. 20) She
attributed the altercation to her use of alcohol together with “Prozac and really high doses
of steroids.” (Tr. 19) She felt angry and aggressive, and she hit him. (Tr. 19-20) He was
not aggressive; however, the videotape showed him not letting her in his truck and pulling
her away from his truck. (Tr. 20) She believed the police arrested Applicant because he
is a large person; he was yelling; and a witness made a statement against him. (Tr. 21-
22) He did not punch her; however, she had “some scrapes and things.” (Tr. 22) She said
she  lied  to  the  police  about  the  abuse  because  she  was  angry,  and  the  drugs  were
affecting her judgment. (Tr. 22)
Applicant’s spouse asked the prosecutors not to charge Applicant, nevertheless,
they prosecuted him. (Tr. 23) He pleaded guilty; and he received a “deferred judgment”
probation agreement. (GE 2; AE A) He received fines and court costs totaling $482. (GE
2) His probation specified that he was not supposed to consume alcohol from February
2018 to February 2019. (Tr. 102-103; GE 2 (stating that he would “[u]se no alcohol”) He
said he had a single relapse; however, he did not report it to his probation officer because
he did not consider it to be relevant. (Tr. 103)3 His probation officer did not specifically
ask him whether he consumed alcohol. (Tr. 105)  He conceded violating probation was
pertinent, but he did not consider it to be crucial. (Tr. 103-104) He received a deferred
3 Applicant’s August 4, 2018 SOR response indicates he has “complied and continues to comply
with his probation” requirements. (SOR response at 4, 6) His SOR response indicates that he “no longer
drives while under the influence” of alcohol. (SOR response at 3)

(GE 3) Applicant admitted that he drank three or four beers almost every day, and every
other weekend he drank seven or eight beers. (Tr. 59-60; GE 3) In the past five years,
Applicant  drank  enough  alcohol  to  have  blackouts  once  or  twice.  (Tr.  115) Applicant’s
spouse said he reduced his alcohol consumption in 2017. (Tr. 16)
On  March  30,  2018,  Applicant  received  an  alcohol  use  assessment.4  It  did  not
recommend  counseling  or  treatment.  (Tr.  105)  He  reported  his  arrests  in  2006,  2011,
2013, and 2017 to security. He said he drank two to six drinks twice a week. He completed
alcohol treatment or counseling in 2006 and 2013.
Applicant  said  he  attends  counseling  once  a  week  or  more  often  as  needed,
meditation, and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings as needed. (Tr. 63, 82) He most
recently attended an AA meeting three weeks before his hearing. (Tr. 113-114) He said
he attends AA meetings once or twice a month; however, he did not attend enough AA
meetings  to  receive  any  AA  coins.  (Tr.  114)  In  May  2018,  he  completed  a  class  on
domestic violence.
More recently, Applicant used Uber or public transportation in lieu of driving himself
after  he  consumes  alcohol.  (Tr.  26-27)  Applicant  said  he  decided  to  quit  consuming
alcohol in 2017, and he actually stopped drinking “[a]bout that time.” (Tr. 101, 116-117)
He subsequently had a couple of relapses. (Tr. 101, 106, 117-118) He said the last time
he consumed alcohol was in August 2018. (Tr. 102, 106, 118)5 His spouse also stopped
consuming alcohol, and they do not have alcohol in their home. (Tr. 17) They do not go
to bars. (Tr. 25) Applicant does not intend to drink alcohol in the future. (Tr. 111)
Character Evidence
In  the  winter  of  2017,  Applicant’s  spouse  had  major  surgery.  (Tr.  18)  After  she
married  Applicant,  she  had  a  stroke,  transient  ischemic  attacks  or  TIAs,  an  embolism,
broken bones from a fall, a Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection,
and  blood  clots.  (Tr.  27-28)  She  spent  41  days  in  intensive  care.  (Tr.  28)  She  was
bedridden for a time. (Tr. 28) She said the post-surgery drugs affected her memory. (Tr.

on March 30, 2018. (SOR response)
5 Applicant’s spouse  did  not pay  attention to the  amount  of beer he drank. (Tr. 41)  She did not
notice  when  he stopped drinking alcohol for several  weeks. (Tr. 42) She  was unable to say  whether he
stopped drinking alcohol in 2017, 2018, or 2019. (Tr. 43)
Applicant’s 2017 and 2018 performance reviews indicate he exceeds expectations
or meets expectations for all categories. (AE B; SOR response) The general sense of the
statements of six of Applicant’s coworkers, a family support worker, and friends is that he
is  diligent,  reliable,  peaceful,  dedicated,  intelligent,  professional,  and  compliant  with
procedural requirements. (AE C; SOR response)
