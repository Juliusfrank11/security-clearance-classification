Applicant  denied  the  allegation  in  SOR  1.a.  He  admitted  in  part  and  denied  in
part  SOR  2.a,  and  he  denied  SOR  2.b,  2.c,  and  2.d.  At  the  hearing,  Department
Counsel withdrew SOR 1.a. (Applicant’s response to the SOR; Tr. at 48-52).
Applicant is a 58-year-old, native-born U.S. citizen. After he graduated from high
school, he attended college but did not earn a degree. He enlisted in the U.S. military
and  honorably  served  from  1981  until  he  retired  in  2001.  He  has  worked  for  various
DOD  contractors  since  2002.  He  worked  for  a  DOD  contractor  in  Iraq  from  2009  to
2011. He has worked in South Korea for his current employer, a DOD contractor, since
late 2015. He has held a security clearance since 2008. (Tr. at 52-109; GE 1-2; AE A-
O).
Applicant married in 1986, divorced in 1989, and remarried in 1994. His spouse
was born in South Korea. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2004. He met her in
South  Korea  when  he  was  stationed  there  in  1992.  He  obtained  permission  from  the
U.S.  military  to  marry  her,  since  she  was  foreign-born.  They  have  resided  in  South
Korea since 2002 and do not have any children. (Tr. at 52-109; GE 1-2; AE A-O).
Applicant’s two sisters-in-law, their spouses, and their children, are citizens and
residents  of  South  Korea.  His  third  sister-in-law  passed  away  in  2017.  Applicant  does
not communicate with his in-laws because he does not speak Korean and they do not
speak  English.  His  wife  maintains  regular  telephonic  communication  with  her  sisters,
and they see each other in person at family gatherings once every three to six months.
None of Applicant’s in-laws are affiliated with the South Korean government or military.
Applicant’s  nephew  performed  mandatory  service  in  the  South  Korean  military  for  21
months. He completed that service in August 2017 and has since worked as an internet
model selling clothes. (Tr. at 52-109; GE 1-2; AE A-O).
Applicant’s  spouse  owns  an  apartment  in  South  Korea  that  is  their  primary
residence.  She  purchased  it  in  2010  for  $256,000  USD,  and  its  current  approximate
value  is  $280,000  USD.  He  does  not  own  any  property  in  South  Korea.  When  he
completed his security application (SCA) in 2016, he thought his spouse had opened a
bank account in South Korea when they moved there in 2002. In fact, his spouse had
not done  so  and  they  do  not have  any  bank  accounts  in  South  Korea. Their  assets  in
the United States total approximately $500,000. (Tr. at 48-49, 52-109; GE 1-2; AE A-O).
Applicant’s  numerous  character  witnesses  attested  to  his  loyalty  to  the  United
States, trustworthiness, honesty, and integrity. (Tr. at 22-46, 109-126; AE E).
South Korea
The  signing  of  the  Treaty  of  Peace  on  May  22,  1882  marked  the  first  official
diplomatic interaction between the United States and South Korea. Following the end of
World  War  II  in  1945,  the  United  States  has  only  maintained  diplomatic  relations  with
South Korea, and has had no formal diplomatic relations with North Korea. South Korea
is one of the United States’ most important strategic and economic partners in Asia.
South  Korean  government  espionage  and  collection  activities  have  resulted  in
criminal  prosecutions  by  the  U.S.  Government.  Industrial  espionage  remains  a  high
profile concern relating to South Korea and South Korean companies. South Korea has
also been the unauthorized recipient of technology controlled under U.S. export control
laws,  including  material  that  could  be  used  in  encryption  software,  optics  and  prism
data, and infrared detectors and camera engines. The U.S. Department of Justice has
highlighted  numerous  efforts  by  South  Korean  persons  and  corporations  to  secure
proprietary and/or export-controlled information in contravention of U.S. law.
In  2017,  the  most  significant  human  rights  issues  in  South  Korea  included
government  interpretation  and  application  of  the  national  security  law,  libel  laws,  and
other laws that limited freedom of expression and restricted internet access; corruption;
and domestic violence.
