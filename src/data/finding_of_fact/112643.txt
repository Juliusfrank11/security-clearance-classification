Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. GX 1 at page 5.) He
has  been  employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  August  of  2014.  (GX  1  at  page
13.)  He  is  married  to  a  U.S.  citizen.  (GX  1  at  pages  26~27.)  Applicant  was  born  in
Dubai, lived in Pakistan when he “was 11 or 10” years old,” and has not visited Pakistan
since then, and moved to the United States in 2003 as a twenty-year-old. (TR at page
17 lines 4~14, and GX 1 at page 6.) He is well respected in the workplace, as attested
to by his “Site . . . Manager.” (AppX A at page 2.)
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a.  Applicant’s  66-year-old  mother  is  a  citizen  of  Pakistan,  but  has  lived  in  the
United States since 2016. (TR at page 15 lines 13~14, at page 16 lines 1~21, at page
30  lines  9~24,  and  at  page  31  lines  17~20.)  She  works  for  a  U.S.  corporation,  and  is
unaware that Applicant is applying for a security clearance. (Id.)
1.b. Applicant’s 40-year-old sister is a dual-citizen of Pakistan and Canada, and
has lived in Canada since 2012. (TR at page 15 lines 19~21, at page 16 line 22 to page
17  line  3,  at  page  18  lines  1~4,  and  at  page  31  lines  17~20.)  Like  her mother,  she  is
unaware that Applicant is applying for a security clearance. (Id.)
Guideline J: Criminal Conduct
2.a. and 2.b. In July of 2006, and again in September of 2006, more than twelve
years ago, Applicant was involved domestic disputes with his newly-married wife. (TR at
page 21 line 6 to page 27 line 16, and at page 28 line 22 to page 30 line 4.) As a result
of  both  incidents  he  was  charged,  but  the  charges  were  subsequently  dismissed.  (Id.)
He  has  attended  anger  management  classes,  and  they  both  have  attended  “marriage
conferences.” (TR at page 21 line 6 to page 27 line 16, at page 28 line 22 to page 30
line 4, and AppX A at page 1.) They have been happily married “for over 12 years,” as
attested to by Applicant’s wife. (AppX A at page 1.) She avers that they “are devoted to
one another and . . . are committed to make this marriage last.” (Id.)
Notice
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the following  facts  regarding  the  Islamic Republic
of Pakistan. Pakistan is a federal republic, but the U.S. Department of State warns U.S.
citizens  not  to  travel  to  Pakistan  due  to  terrorism.  Pakistan  has  suffered  numerous
terrorist attacks. Pakistan has recently also had significant human rights issues.
