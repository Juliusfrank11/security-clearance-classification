In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied, with brief comments, all of the factual
allegations pertaining to foreign influence in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c.), and all
of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 2.b.
through 2.j.), claiming that the citizenship and residence of his family members and the
issues regarding his debts have no bearing on his trustworthiness and do not compromise
his ability to hold a security clearance. Other than those brief comments, Applicant offered
no facts or explanations addressing the specifics of the allegations in the SOR.  After a
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration
of same, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  a  manager,  advanced  verification,  since  he  joined  his  employer  in  February  2016.
Applicant received a bachelor’s degree from a foreign university in 1991; and a master’s
degree from a university in the United States in 1995. He has never served with the U.S.
military  or  any  other  military.  He  has  never  held  a  security  clearance.  Applicant  was
married in 1996, and he reports one child, born in 2006.
2  Administrative  or  official  notice  is  the  appropriate  type  of  notice  used  for  administrative
proceedings. See McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986);
ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct.
12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)). The most common basis for
administrative notice at ISCR proceedings is to notice facts that are either well known or from government
reports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for
administrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize authoritative information or sources
from the internet. See, e.g. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006) (citing internet sources for numerous
documents).  In  this  instance,  although  Department  Counsel  has  selected  only  certain  pages  of  facts
appearing in the identified publications, I have not limited myself to only those facts, but have considered
the publications in their entirety.
Foreign Influence3
Applicant was born in Bangladesh. He entered the United States in 1994, and he
became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  2005.  Applicant’s  parents  are  both  residents  and
citizens  of Bangladesh.  His father  worked  in education  until he  retired nearly  25  years
ago, and his mother worked in family planning until she retired over 22 years ago. Both
parents are in their 70s or 80s. Applicant has two brothers who are also residents and
citizens  of  Bangladesh.  One  brother  works  for  a  private  company  associated  with  the
construction business, and his other brother owns his own business. None of those family
members  were  affiliated  with  a  foreign  government,  military,  security,  or  intelligence
service. Applicant speaks with his parents monthly, and he travels to Bangladesh to visit
them  every  one  to  two  years.  He  speaks and  texts  his brothers monthly,  and he  sees
them whenever he visits his parents. His relationship with one sister is more distant, and
while he infrequently exchanges texts and e-mails, he has not seen her since 2014. His
relationship with his other sister is generally non-existent, and he has not had any contact
with her, or seen her, since 2005. Applicant has contributed approximately $1,000 every
three to six months to one of his brothers to assist with their parents’ needs.
Applicant’s wife was also born in Bangladesh, and she too is a naturalized U.S.
citizen.  Both  of  her  parents  were  born  in  Bangladesh,  but  they  were  naturalized  U.S.
citizens and residents of the United States. Her father passed away in 2016.
Bangladesh
Bangladesh is located on the northern edge of the Bay of Bengal; it is bordered on
three  sides  by  India and  shares  a  small  border with  Burma.  Approximately  160  million
people inhabit Bangladesh, which has a land area of 55,598 square miles, slightly less
than that of Iowa. It is the eighth most populous nation in the world and the most densely
populated country, aside from some city states and tiny island nations.
Originally  part  of  British  India,  after  the  partition  of  British  India  in  1947,  the  entity
known  initially  as  East  Bengal  and  then  East  Pakistan  was  established.  In  April  1972,
following a war between India and Pakistan, the United States recognized East Pakistan as
Bangladesh  -  a  parliamentary  democracy  with  a  unicameral  legislature.  The  nation  is  a
developing  country  with  severe  infrastructure  shortcomings.  Outside  of  Dhaka,  tourist
facilities are under-developed as are capacities to deal with emergency situations.
Despite some earlier military coups following independence, Bangladesh has made
significant progress toward a more prosperous and pluralistic society since its independence
in 1971. Bangladesh returned to democratic rule in December 2008. Bangladesh’s economy
has  grown  at  6  percent  annually  for  more  than  two  decades.  The  United  States  remains

employment, names of individuals, groups, or locations. The cited sources: Item 3 (e-QIP, dated January
21, 2016); Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated January 3, 2017); Item 4 (Subject Contact, dated

actively  engaged  in  efforts  to  strengthen  respect  for  labor  rights  and  improve  workplace
safety.  Despite  significant  development  achievements,  poverty  remains  a  challenge.
Infrastructure shortcomings, weak governance structures, and potential terrorist exploitation
by extremist groups are also vulnerabilities. The fact that Bangladesh is one of the world’s
most densely populated countries compounds these challenges.
U.S. Assistance to Bangladesh
Bangladesh is the largest recipient of U.S. assistance in Asia outside of Afghanistan
and Pakistan. U.S. assistance fosters engagement with the Government of Bangladesh and
complements support from other donors to address the underlying social, demographic, and
economic factors that threaten democratic governance, stifle economic growth, and increase
vulnerability to extremism in Bangladesh. The United States continues to build upon previous
gains  to  reduce  poverty,  improve  health  and  education,  mitigate  the  impact  of  natural
disasters, and achieve better governance to spur equitable and sustainable growth.
Bilateral Economic Relations
The United States exports to Bangladesh include agricultural products (cotton, wheat,
dairy), aircraft, machinery, and iron and steel products.  The United States is Bangladesh’s
single largest importer of goods including apparel, other textile products, headgear, shrimp
and prawns, and agricultural products (primarily tobacco). The two countries conduct annual
talks under a Trade and Investment Cooperation Framework Agreement (TICFA) signed in
2013.
Bangladesh's Membership in International Organizations
Bangladesh  and  the  United  States  belong  to  a  number  of  the  same  international
organizations, including the United Nations, ASEAN Regional Forum, International Monetary
Fund,  World  Bank,  and  World  Trade  Organization.  The  United  States  and  Bangladesh
cooperate closely on security issues, ranging from counterterrorism to peacekeeping.
Human Rights and Terrorism in Bangladesh
Bangladesh's legal system is based on  common law, and its principal source of
laws  are  acts  of  Parliament.  Although  human  rights  are  enshrined  in  the  country's
constitution,  government  and  security  forces  have  been  known  to  flout  constitutional
principles  and  have  been  accused  of  human  rights  abuses.  In  a  2017  Human  Rights
Report, the U.S. Department of State stated that the most significant human rights issues
included  extrajudicial  killings,  torture,  arbitrary  or  unlawful  detentions,  and  forced
disappearances  by  government  security  forces;  restrictions  on  civil  liberties,  including
freedom of speech, press, and the activities of nongovernmental organizations; a lack of
freedom  to  participate  in  the  political  process;  corruption;  violence  and  discrimination
based  on  gender,  religious  affiliation,  caste,  tribe,  including  indigenous  persons;
trafficking in persons; and restrictions on worker’s rights and the worst forms of child labor.
In addition to the usual criminal activities of some persons in the society, several
anti-Western Islamic terrorist groups have engaged in a variety of attacks against diverse
groups  and  individuals,  including  students,  Hindus,  Buddhists,  Christians,  Shia,  and
secular  bloggers.  Americans  have  not  been  specifically  targeted  for  terrorist  activity
simply because they are Americans, but there is a current terrorist threat of attack against
Westerners  in  Bangladesh.  Counter-terrorism  raids  have  been  conducted  by  the
government. The U.S. Department of State has assessed Dhaka and Chittagong as being
high-threat locations for crime and terrorist activity, including such activity directed at or
affecting official U.S. government interests.
Although Applicant’s family members resided well outside (more than 200 miles)
the two cited areas of heightened risk, some of them moved several years ago to one of
those areas.4
Applicant’s Travel to Bangladesh
Since becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant has traveled to Bangladesh  on at least six
occasions,  visiting  his  family  members  for  periods  of  up  to  21  days  each.  He  was  never
contacted by or had any contact with any person known or suspected of being involved  or
associated  with  foreign  intelligence,  terrorists,  security,  or  military  organizations.  He  was
never in contact with anyone exhibiting excessive knowledge or undue interest in him or his
job.  He  was  not  in  contact  with  anyone  attempting  to  obtain  classified  information  or
unclassified, sensitive information. He was never threatened, coerced, or pressured in any
way to cooperate with a foreign government official or foreign intelligence or security service.
He was never threatened, coerced, pressured, put under duress or blackmailed because of
relatives, friends, or other contacts living in Bangladesh.5
Financial Considerations6
It is unclear when Applicant first started having financial difficulties,  although he
acknowledged that during an unspecified period leading up to October 2007, a business
with his personal guarantees went under. As a result, in October 2007, Applicant and his
wife  filed  a  joint  petition  for  bankruptcy  under  Chapter  7  of  the  U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code
citing  $242,800  in  creditors  holding  secured  claims;  and  $602,402  in  creditors  holding
unsecured  nonpriority  claims,  totaling  $845,202  in  total  liabilities.  On  May  6,  2008,
Applicant’s  debts  were  discharged.7  In  January  2016,  when  completing  his  e-QIP,
Applicant  denied  any  financial  issues  such  as  delinquencies,  collections,  or  accounts
being charged off. In January 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the
U.S.  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  During  that  initial  interview,  Applicant
stated  that  since  his  bankruptcy  discharge,  he  re-established  his  credit,  and  that  his

financial status since the bankruptcy is stable. He added that he feels he is capable of
meeting his current financial obligations.8
During a subsequent OPM interview in December 2017, Applicant acknowledged
that  despite  the  bankruptcy  discharge,  he  still  owed  large  amounts  of  undocumented
money to family and friends. In addition, he was caring for his parents, resulting in multiple
overseas trips, and medical and living expenses for them. Because of the bankruptcy, he
continued  to  borrow  money  from  non-conventional  sources  with  high  interest  rates  to
keep  up  with  payments  and  living  expenses.  With  insufficient  funds  to  maintain  his
accounts, in September 2017, he engaged the professional services of a company that
performs  debt  negotiations  to  provide  debt  relief.9  Under  that  agreement,  Applicant
agreed  to  make  $1,514  in  monthly  payments  to  the  debt  company  commencing  on
October 6, 2017, and the debt company would attempt to negotiate debt relief regarding
23 different accounts totaling $117,230.10 Applicant did not submit any documentation,
such as cancelled checks, bank statements, receipts, etc., to indicate that any monthly
payments were made to the debt company, or that any payments were made by Applicant
or the debt company to any of Applicant’s creditors.
At  the  end  of  his  December  2017  interview,  Applicant  was  questioned  about  a
substantial  number  of  cash  transactions,  each  in  excess  of  $10,000,  that  were  made
throughout the period 2005 through 2017 at various casinos in several states. Applicant
was  reluctant  to  answer  questions  regarding  the  casinos,  and  specifically  refused  to
answer questions pertaining to the frequent transactions. He did, however, acknowledge
that since he was struggling financially, and he felt he was good at gambling, he did so to
win money to help pay his debts. He acknowledged that “sometimes he won,” implying
that most of  the  time he  lost.  Applicant  gambles  as  a  hobby  and for fun  to perfect  his
skills. He denied having issues with gambling. He denied that gambling ever created any
financial problems for him. Furthermore, Applicant was unsure if he will continue to visit
casinos in the future.11
In addition to Applicant’s Chapter 7 Bankruptcy (SOR ¶ 2.b.); his enrollment in a
debt relief program covering $117,230 in debts (SOR ¶ 2.c.); and his casino  gambling
activities  (SOR  ¶  2.a.),  described  above,  the  SOR  identified eight delinquent  accounts
that had been placed for collection or charged off as generally reflected by Applicant’s
February  2016  or June  2018  credit  reports. Those debts,  total  approximately  $57,027.
Among the list of creditors the debt company was supposed to contact, are some of the
SOR-related accounts. There are also a substantial number of accounts in that list, most

of  which  had  balances  between  $3,000  and  $12,000,  which  were  not  alleged  in  the
SOR.12
Applicant’s  outstanding  financial  obligations  alleged  in  the  SOR,  all  of  which
Applicant simply denied in his Answer to the SOR, but essentially acknowledged to the
debt company, are as follows: an  unspecified type of account for $6,551, but listed for
$10,647 in his creditor list (SOR ¶ 2.d.); a credit card for $1,564 that was charged off, but
listed for $715 in his creditor list (SOR ¶ 2.e.); a credit card for $8,129 that was charged
off, but listed for $6,471 in his creditor list (SOR ¶ 2.f.); a credit card for $5,296 that was
charged off, but listed for $4,135 in his creditor list (SOR ¶ 2.g.); a credit card for $1,929,
but listed for $1,277 in his creditor list (SOR ¶ 2.h.); an unspecified type of account for
$755 that was past due in the amount of $196 (SOR ¶ 2.i.); an unspecified type of account
for $3,760 that was charged off, but listed for $3,614 in his creditor list (SOR ¶ 2.j.); and
an unspecified type of account for $22,492 that was charged off, but listed for $22,044 in
his creditor list (SOR ¶ 2.k.).13
In September 2017, Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Summary to his debt
company.  It  indicated  that  his  monthly  take-home-pay  was  $9,000;  monthly  expenses
were  $7,406,  not  including  his  debt  company  program  payments;  leaving  a  monthly
remainder of $1,695 if no such program payments were made, or $81 if those program
payments  were  made,  available for discretionary  saving  or spending.14  It  is not  known
what Applicant’s current financial resources may be because he did not report his current
net  monthly  income;  monthly  expenses;  and  any  monthly  remainder  that  might  be
available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. Except
for an acknowledgment that he had received credit counseling associated with his 2007
bankruptcy, there is no indication that subsequent financial counseling from a legitimate
and credible source had been received. As noted above, during his initial OPM interview,
Applicant  stated  that  since  his  bankruptcy  discharge,  he  re-established  his  credit,  and
that his financial status since the bankruptcy  was stable. He added that he felt he was
capable  of  meeting  his  current  financial  obligations.  Facts  developed  following  that
12 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal
Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to
evaluate  an  applicant's  evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to  consider
whether  an  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful  rehabilitation;  (d)  to  decide  whether  a  particular
provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis
under Directive § 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No.
02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also

Applicant’s financial situation is now under control.
