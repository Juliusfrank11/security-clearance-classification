Applicant is a 65-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  November  2016.  He  has  a  doctorate  degree  (PhD),  which
was  awarded  in  1997.  Applicant  married  in  2013,  although  he  and  his  spouse  have
been cohabitating since 1997. He does not have children.1
Applicant had periods of unemployment and underemployment from about 2008
until  he  obtained  his  current  job  in  November  2018.  He  also  developed  cognitive
problems that made it difficult to work at his previous level. As a consequence, he was
unable to pay all his bills. Debts became delinquent and taxes went unpaid.2
Applicant  and  his  spouse  filed  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  case  in  August  2015.
Under Schedule D, Creditors Holding Secured Claims, the petition listed $24,860 owed
on  a  car  loan.  Under  Schedule  E,  Creditors  Holding  Unsecured  Priority  Claims,  the
petition listed $4,500 owed to the IRS and $3,000 owed to his state. The petition listed
debts  totaling  $50,237  under  Schedule  F,  Creditors  Holding  Unsecured  Nonpriority
Claims. The bankruptcy court allowed claims totaling $15,055 from the IRS and $3,084
from the state.3
The Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was dismissed upon Applicant’s motion in July
2016  because  he  could  not  afford  to  maintain  the  monthly  payments.  The  trustee’s
report  shows  that  Applicant  paid  $10,817  into  the  plan.  Applicant’s  attorney  was  paid
$3,310; the trustee was paid $678; the IRS was paid $4,954; the state was paid $1,124;
and $750 was refunded to Applicant.4
The SOR alleges the dismissed Chapter 13 bankruptcy case; a $1,097 state tax
lien; two unpaid judgments totaling $5,537; and four delinquent debts. However, one of
the  delinquent  debts  is  the  underlying  debt  that  resulted  in  one  of  the  judgments.  The
total  amount  of  the  three  remaining  debts  is  $25,198.  The  allegations  are  established
through credit reports, Applicant’s admissions, and the Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition.
Applicant’s spouse has managed the family’s finances since before they married.
Applicant  did  not  have  any  tax  problems  before  his  2013  marriage.  He  always  had

unpaid federal taxes, but I consider the above information to be facts and circumstances surrounding the
Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, which was alleged. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will not be
used  for  disqualification  purposes.  It  may  be  considered  in  assessing  Applicant’s  overall  financial
situation, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in the whole-person analysis.

enough withheld from his salary to pay his taxes. His spouse is self-employed. Nothing
is  withheld  from  Applicant’s  spouse’s  paycheck,  and  he  is  responsible  for  paying  his
taxes  throughout  the  year.  Applicant’s  spouse  did  not  pay  enough  in  taxes  for  several
years. They filed joint returns, which made Applicant jointly liable for all the taxes owed
from their combined income.5
Applicant has been paying the IRS and his state since 2016. His state reported
that  he  made  payments  totaling  $3,561  between  April  2016  and  December  2018.  The
payments were applied to taxes owed for tax years 2012, 2013, and 2014. He currently
owes the state $2,757 for tax year 2013 and $3,471 for 2015.6
Records  from  the  IRS  show  that  Applicant  made  payments  totaling  $5,302
between  March  2017  and  January  2019.  The  IRS  applied  $500  to  tax  year  2017,  the
rest  was  applied  to  tax  year  2015.  He  entered  into  a  $366  per  month  installment
agreement with the IRS in July 2018. He has made payments to the IRS every month,
but  the  last  three  monthly  payments  were  $277,  $600,  and  $250,  which  totaled  more
than $366 per month for three months. He currently owes the IRS $4,524 for tax year
2017.7
Applicant’s  financial  adviser  recommended  that  he  file  2018  tax  returns  as
“married  filing  separately.”  This  will  prevent  Applicant  from  assuming  his  spouse’s  tax
problems. He increased his federal withholding by $300 per month and his state by $50
per  month.  Any  additional  refunds  generated  by  the  increased  withholdings  will  be
applied toward his back taxes.  He filed  a Request for Innocent Spouse  Relief petition,
which  if  approved  would  alleviate  some  of  his  tax  problems  from  previous  years.
Applicant listed on the form that he had cognitive problems.8
Applicant  has  not  paid  any  of  the  non-tax  judgments  and  debts  alleged  in  the
SOR. He felt it was more important to address his taxes first, and then his other debts.
He will attempt to settle the debts through lump-sum payments. He has not accrued any
new delinquent debts. His financial advisor has assisted him in creating a budget.9
Applicant  submitted  letters  attesting  to  his  honesty,  responsibility,  work  ethic,
intelligence,  diligence,  selflessness,  generosity  of  time  and  spirit,  conscientiousness,
professionalism, enthusiasm, dedication, and integrity. His psychiatrist has treated him
for  ten  years.  He  opined  that  Applicant’s  “judgment  is  intact  and  that  he  is  stable,
reliable and trustworthy.”10
