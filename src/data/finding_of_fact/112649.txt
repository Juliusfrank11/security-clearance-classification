Applicant  is  a  49-year-old  customer-service  supervisor  employed  by  a  federal
contractor since May 2017. He was employed in the private sector until he quit his job in
December  2016.  He  was  unemployed  until  he  was  hired  by  his  current  employer.  He
has never held a security clearance or eligibility for a public trust position.
Applicant married in December 1994 and divorced in March 2002. He married his
current spouse in October 2012. He has three children, ages 24, 14, and 11.  The two
older  children  live  with  him.  He  pays  child  support  for  the  11-year-old,  who  is  from
another relationship and lives with her mother. (Tr. 21.) He attended college from May
2013 to August 2016 but did not receive a degree.
Applicant  earns  about  $59,000  per  year.  His  wife  is  a  corporate  vice-president
and earns about $175,000 per year. (Tr. 22-23.) Applicant has a retirement account of
about $50,000 and his wife has a retirement account of about $100,000.
Applicant disclosed in his e-QIP that a federal tax lien was imposed against him
in January 2004, and that he had retained a lawyer to resolve it. (GX 1 at 35.) When he
was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in  December  2017,  he  told  the  investigator
that he was notified in 2010 that a federal tax lien had been filed against him for about
$130,000 and that the lien had not been satisfied. (GX 3 at 10.)
When Applicant responded to DOHA financial interrogatories in September 2018,
he disclosed that he had failed to file his federal and state income tax returns on time for
tax years 2002, 2003, 2004, 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017. He repeated this disclosure at
the hearing. (Tr. 43.) He testified that he believed he was not required to file returns for
years when he did not owe any taxes. (Tr. 45-47.)
In  his  September  2018  responses  to  DOHA  interrogatories,  Applicant  also
disclosed that he owed federal and state taxes for 2000 through 2004 and 2010. (GX 2
at  2.)  He  testified  that  he owes  about $40,000  in  “real money,” but  that  the amount  of
the debt has increased because of penalties and interest. (Tr. 28.) Because he moved
frequently,  he  was  not  aware  of  his  tax  debt  until  2010.  (Tr.  29.)  He  testified  that  he
hired a tax preparer to file his tax returns for 2000 through 2004, but the returns were
never  filed.  When  he  found  out  about  his  tax  debt  in  2010,  he  encountered  difficulty
obtaining the documentation he needed to file the returns for 2000-2004 because of the
lapse of time. (Tr. 34.)
When  Applicant  responded  to  DOHA  interrogatories  in  September  2018,  he
included  an  IRS  account  transcript  reflecting  that  he  owed  $761.76  for  tax  year  2010.
(GX 2 at 9.) This tax debt was alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c, which he denied in his answer to
the  SOR.  At  the  hearing,  he  was  unsure  whether  the  debt  had  been  paid.  (Tr.  50.)
Although I kept the record open to enable him to provide documentary evidence, he did
not provide any further information about this debt.
Applicant testified that he entered into a payment agreement with the IRS around
2011  and  was  making  monthly  $300  payments  until  he  hired  a  tax-relief  company  in
2013,  and  the  company  advised  him  to  stop  making  payments  so  that  they  could
negotiate  a  settlement  with  the  IRS.  He  testified  that  he  paid  the  tax-relief  company
$2,500.  He  provided  no  documentary  evidence  of  his  contract  with  the  tax-relief
company. As of the date of the hearing, he had made no payments to the IRS and the
tax  debt  was  not  resolved.  He  testified  that  he  received  a  letter  from  the  IRS  in  2018
stating that the balance due was about $42,000. (Tr. 35-87.) He did not submit a copy of
the letter.
interrogatories
When  Applicant  responded
in  September  and
to  DOHA
November  2018,  he  stated  that  he  had  obtained  extensions  of  time  to  file  his  federal
returns for 2015, 2016, and 2017, and that all returns had been filed. (GX 2 at 2; GX 3
at  3.)  He  submitted  IRS  account  transcripts  for  tax  years  2008  through  2014.  The
transcripts  reflect  that  the  return  for  2008  was  filed  in  July  2011,  the  returns  for  2009
and 2010 were filed in May 2011, the return for 2011 was filed in May 2012, the return
for  2013  was  filed  in  March  2015  (after he  received  an  extension  until  October  2014),
and the return for 2014 was filed in August 2015. (GX 2 at 5-12.)
A credit report from October 2018 reflected 12 delinquent medical debts, alleged
in  SOR  ¶¶  1.d-1.o.  All  the  debts  were  related  to  a  period  of  hospitalization  when
Applicant did not have medical insurance. He submitted an application for relief from the
out-of-pocket expenses, but it was denied because his and his wife’s income were too
high to qualify for relief. (Tr. 55.)
Four  debts,  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.d-1.g,  are  for  the  same  amount  ($259)  and
reflected  in  the  same  credit  report.  The  specific  creditor  is  not  alleged.  In  Applicant’s
answer to the  SOR  and  at  the  hearing,  he asserted  that  the four are  duplicates  of  the
same debt. He testified that he contacted the hospital in early 2018 and was informed
that  the four debts  were  duplicates.  (Tr. 54.)  He  testified that  the hospital sent him  an
updated bill in October 2018, removing the duplicate debts. (Tr. 56.) He did not submit a
copy of the updated bill.
Applicant denied the $70 medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j, which is reflected in
the  October  2018  credit  report.  (GX  4  at  2.)  He  submitted  no  evidence  showing  the
basis  for  his  denial  and  no  evidence  that  he  disputed  the  debt  with  the  creditor,  the
collection  agency,  or  the  credit  bureau.  He  admitted  all  the  other  medical  debts  and
stated that he was working with the creditors to resolve them. He testified that he began
making monthly $25 payments to the hospital in April 2018 and had continued making
payments  up  to  the  date  of  the  hearing.  (Tr.  58.)  He  did  not  submit  any  documentary
evidence of payments.
The  October  2018  credit  report  also  reflects  a  child-support  arrearage  of  $273,
alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.p.  Applicant  testified  that  the  arrearage  arose  when  he  initially
denied that he was the father of a child but was later determined to be the father. By the
time that paternity was determined, his liability for six or seven months of child-support
had accrued. (GX 3 at 11.) He testified that he had paid the arrearage and is currently
paying $495 per month by automatic deduction from his pay. (Tr. 62-63.) The October
2018 credit report reflects that his scheduled payments are $495 per month, that his last
payment was in September 2018, that the balance due was $768, and that the account
was  past  due  for  $273.  (GX  4  at  3.)  Applicant  did  not  submit  any  documentation
showing  that  the  arrearage  was  satisfied  or  that  payments  were  being  made  by
automatic payroll deduction.
Applicant testified that he and his wife have been working with an accountant for
seven or eight months to improve their financial management. (Tr. 67-68.) He provided
no evidence of specific steps he had taken to improve his financial management.
