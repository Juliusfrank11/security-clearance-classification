Applicant is a 33-year-old cyber-risk consultant employed by a federal contractor
since  December  2015.  He  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  May  2007  and  a  master’s
degree in May 2011. He has worked for federal contractors since August 2011. He was
cleared for a public trust position in December 2011. He has never married and has no

The SOR alleges six delinquent debts reflected in a credit report from February
2018. (GX 2.) The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below.
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b:  two  student  loans  from  same  lender  for  $12,606  and
$5,701, both charged off in September 2013.  In Applicant’s answer to the SOR and in
his testimony at the hearing, he stated that he decided to stop making payments on these
loans, because the lender had not explained why the balances were not decreasing even
though he was making regular payments. He submitted a payment history dated August
6, 2018, reflecting electronic payments from October 2012 through April 2013. Most of
the amounts paid were applied to interest, with only a small amount applied to principal.
(AX A.) He did not consult with a legal or financial professional before he stopped making
payments. (Tr. 28.)
At the hearing, Applicant testified that, as of the date of the hearing, he had not
made any payments on the debts since April 2013. He hoped to negotiate a “substantial
payoff” in return for the lender’s agreement to forgive some of the debt. (Tr. 16.)
On February 28, 2019, the date the record closed, Applicant and the lender agreed
to settle the alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b for $2,280. (AX J.) He submitted no evidence that he
had paid the agreed amount. The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a is unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c: delinquent credit-card account placed for collection of $2,088 in
December  2017.  Applicant  testified  that  he  missed  two  payments  on  this  account

because a roommate who was sharing the rent payments on an apartment unexpectedly
moved out in 2014, causing him to deplete most of his savings to pay the rent. (Tr. 31-
32.) . Applicant does not have a payment agreement for this debt, but he has been making
monthly payments of between $20 and $50 since November 2017. (AX B; AX J.) He has
reduced the balance due to $1,799. (AX M.)
SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.e:  student  loan  past  due  for  $3,724,  with  a  balance  of
$106,683;  and  student  loan  past  due  for  $2,401,  with  a  balance  of  $68,799.  The
February 2018 credit report reflected both debts as more than 120 days past due as of
December 2017. (GX 2 at 6.) In his answer to the SOR, Applicant provided evidence that
the two loans had been consolidated in April 2018 and were in forbearance at that time.
(AX C.) He made no payments between 2014 and the date of the hearing. He is scheduled
to begin making payments of about $500 per month on these loans in April 2019. (Tr. 18,
35-37.)
SOR ¶ 1.f: unpaid rent placed for collection of $1,642. Applicant denied owing
this debt, and he submitted evidence from the property manager showing that the debt
had been satisfied and was erroneously referred for collection. (AX D; Tr. 20-21.)
For the past two years, Applicant has earned about $81,000 per year. In his first
job after graduate school, he earned $56,000 per year, which increased to $62,000 by
the time he left this job in June 2014. He earned $70,000 per year from June 2014 to
December 2015. He started his current job at $80,000 per year in December 2015, and
he  has  earned  $81,000  for  the  past  two  years.  (Tr.  24-25.)  He  has  a  net  monthly
remainder, after paying living expenses and the credit-card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c, of
about $2,102. (AX E at 10.) He had $7,125 in his retirement account as of June 2018,
with an outstanding loan of $1,642. (AX E at 4.)
In  Applicant’s  SCA,  he  disclosed  foreign  vacation  travel  in  May  2013,  May  and
November 2015, April and May 2016, October 2016, June 2017, and May and June 2017.
He testified that this travel was for low-cost vacations. He estimated that his out-of- pocket
expenses for each trip were between $500 and $1,100. (Tr. 51.)
Applicant’s close friend, who has known him for about ten years, submitted a letter
describing  Applicant’s  community  service.  He  describes  Applicant  as  “a  fine  man  of
immense integrity, among an abundance of other positive attributes.” (AX I at 1.) A co-
worker  was  impressed  by  Applicant’s  ability  to  organize  work,  delegate  tasks,
communicate  with  senior  leadership,  and  create  comradery  among  workers  of  various
competencies and skill levels. This co-worker considers Applicant trustworthy, sincere,
and diligent. (AX I at 2.) Another co-worker and a former roommate described Applicant’s
community  service  and  dedication  to  his  job.  (AX  I  at  3.)  Applicant’s  former  mentor  at
work was impressed with his positive attitude and desire to learn new skills. He believes
that  Applicant  has  the  initiative  and  moral  judgment  required  to  work  as  a  federal
contractor.  (AX  I  at  4.)  A  former  supervisor  describes  Applicant  as  highly  intelligent,
motivated,  and  trustworthy.  (AX  I  at  5.)  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  his
performance evaluations have been generally positive, but he did not submit copies of
any written evaluations. (Tr. 14.)
At the hearing, Applicant attributed his financial history to immaturity. He believes
that he has matured and learned from his mistakes after being in the workforce for eight
years. (Tr. 23.)
