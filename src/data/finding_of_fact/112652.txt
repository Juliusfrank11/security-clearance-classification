Applicant  is  51  years  old. She  obtained  her  bachelor’s  degree  in  2005  and  she
has been employed as a security professional by a federal contractor since June 2016.
Applicant reported no military service or previous security clearance. She never married
and  reports  no  children.  Applicant  reported  her  failure  to  timely  file  federal  and  state
income tax returns for tax year (TY) 2014, and her failure to pay taxes, in section 26 of
her security clearance application (SCA).2 She stated that she did not have the money
and still doesn’t. In her March 2018 personal subject interview (PSI), Applicant said she
was afraid to file her income tax returns because she was barely getting by financially,
and she didn’t think she could pay the income taxes due. (Item 4)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b allege Applicant failed to timely file federal and state income
tax returns as required for TYs 2014 – 2016. In her September 7, 2018 answer to the
SOR,  Applicant  admitted  failing  to  file  or  pay  the  taxes  as  alleged.  (Item  2)  In  her
answers to interrogatories, Applicant asserted that the delinquent tax returns were filed,
and all taxes paid, on May 7, 2018. (Item 4) However, she is awaiting a bill from the IRS
for TY 2016 penalties and fees owing. No explanation was provided why she waited so
long  to file the  income  tax  returns for TYs  2014 –  2016. The  tax  transcripts  show  that
she filed the TY 2014 income tax return on July 16, 2018, and the TYs 2015 and 2016
returns on June 25, 2018.
In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations at SOR ¶¶1.c and 1.d
that  she  is  indebted  to  the  federal  government  for  delinquent  taxes  in  the  amount  of
$215  for  TY  2014,  and  to  the  state  government  for  delinquent  taxes  from  TYs  2014-
2016. She attached cancelled checks to her answer confirming that all delinquent state
and  federal  income  taxes  have  been  paid.  This  is  corroborated  by  IRS  tax  transcripts
that she attached to her answers to interrogatories. (Item 4) The tax transcripts indicate
that Applicant had adjusted gross income (AGI) of $12,088 in TY 2013; $18,080 in TY
2014; $21,576 in TY 2015; $28,819 in TY 2016; and $33,379 in TY 2017. She has zero
balances  remaining  for  each  relevant  TY,  and  although  she  may  owe  some  modest
penalties  and  fees,  she  has  substantially  complied  with  repaying  her  delinquent  tax
debts.
Applicant  provided  no  evidence  that  she  received  financial  counseling.  She
provided no budget showing income against expenses, or other documentation to show
why she was unable to timely file federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2014 –
2016 as required, or why she feared that she couldn’t afford to pay the taxes due. In the
FORM, Department Counsel informed Applicant that it was important for her to provide
1  Unless  stated  otherwise,  the  source  of  the  information  in  this  section  is  Applicant’s  June  14,  2017
security clearance application (SCA) (Item 3), or her answers to interrogatories signed on July 24, 2018,
verifying her personal security interview (PSI) on March 27, 2018. (Item 4)

corroborating  or  supporting  documentation  of  resolution  of  the  debts  in  the  SOR.
(FORM at 3) She did not do so.
