Applicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  February  2018.  He  has  a  master’s  degree  from  an  Indian
university. He is married with two children. (Tr. at 14-15, 31, 56; GE 1-3.)
Applicant was born in Sudan to Sudanese parents. He immigrated to the United
States under the lottery system in 1997. He became a U.S. citizen in 2002. His wife is a
U.S.  citizen  originally  from  Sudan.  His  children  were  born  in  the  United  States.  His  in-
laws are U.S. citizens and residents. (Tr. at 14, 31-32, 42; GE1-3)
Applicant  came  from  a  large  family.  His  parents  have  been  deceased  for
decades.  His  stepmother,  six  siblings,  and  four  half-siblings  are  Sudanese  citizens.
Most  are also  residents  of  Sudan.  He  has  a brother who  lives  in  Saudi Arabia;  a  half-
sibling who is a U.S. citizen and resident; and a half-sibling who is a citizen and resident
of the United Kingdom. One of Applicant’s brothers is a retired officer in the Sudanese
military. (Tr. at 32-35; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3)
Applicant  last  visited  his  family  in  Sudan  in  2014.  He  communicates  with  his
family in Sudan through social media. He does not own any property in Sudan. He owns
his home in the United States. He credibly testified that he is loyal to the United States,
and that his family in Sudan could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing
classified information. (Tr. at 14-16, 37-38, 40-41, 44; GE 1-3)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  problems,  which  he  attributed  to  his  and  his
wife’s  unemployment,  underemployment,  and  medical  problems,  particularly  during
periods of unemployment when they did not have medical insurance. The SOR alleges
17  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $51,200.  Five  of  the  debts,  totaling  about  $10,250,
are medical debts. Two debts totaling about $4,560 are defaulted student loans. Except
as  addressed  below,  the  allegations  are  established  through  credit  reports  and
Applicant’s  admissions.  (Tr.  at  14-15,  49-54;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR;  GE  3-6)
Since he was hired by his current employer in February 2018, he has been addressing
the debts as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a delinquent loan with a balance of $16,875. The loan was for
in  vitro  fertilization  (IVF)  for  his  wife  to  conceive  their  second  child.  Applicant  entered
into a $100 per month payment plan in August 2018. He documented $100 payments in
August,  September,  and  October  2018.  He  entered  into  another  $100  per  month
payment  plan  on  August  2019.  The  balance  is  $12,459.  It  is  unclear  if  the  balance
reflects additional undocumented payments. (Tr. at 57-64; Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 4-6; AE F, L, M, M-4)
A collection company is collecting three debts totaling $10,200 owed to the same
bank  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b-1.d).  Applicant  agreed  to  a  $50  per month  payment  plan  in  August
2018.  He  documented  $50  payments  in  August,  September,  and  October  2018.  His
checking account reflects 11 additional $50 checks, but he did not provide the cancelled
checks, so they cannot be positively accredited as payments. However, I note that the
balances  on  the  accounts  have  gone  down.  The  balance  of  the  SOR  ¶  1.b  debt  was
$3,648 in August 2017; $3,298 in March 2019; and $3,148 in August 2019. The balance
of the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c was $3,287 in May 2018 and $3,137 in August 2019.
The balance of the SOR ¶ 1.d debt was $3,279 in August 2017; $2,929 in March 2019;
and $2,729 in August 2019. (Tr. at 64-72; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 4-6; AE E,
J, L, M, M-5, M-6)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  a  charged-off  $3,075  credit  card  debt.  Applicant  and  the
creditor  settled  the  debt  in  August  2018  for  31  monthly  $100  payments.  In  July  2019,
the  creditor  verified  that  they  had  received  $1,200  in  payments,  and  the  balance  was
$1,996. (Tr. at 74-77; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 4-6; AE G, M, M-2, M-3)
Applicant has brought his two student loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.h) out of default,
and he is current on their combined monthly payments of $50. Because of interest, the
balances  had  increased from  the  total amount  alleged  in  the  SOR  ($4,560) to  $4,676.
Recent payments have reduced the total balance of the two loans to $4,415. (Tr. at 77-
79; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 4-6; AE L, M-5, M-6)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges a charged-off $2,528 credit card debt. Applicant entered into a
$50  per  month  payment  plan  in  August  2018.  The  balance  of  the  debt  was  $2,200  in
March 2019 and $2,000 in August 2019. (Tr. at 80; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 4-
6; AE D, M-2, M-3)
A collection company is collecting two debts that at one time totaled $2,077 owed
to the same bank (SOR ¶¶ 1.j and 1.k). In August 2018, Applicant agreed to payment
plans of $49.16 and $49.83 per month for the two debts. He documented his payments
and reduced the total amount owed on the two debts to $1,384 in March 2019 and $889
in August 2019. (Tr. at 82-85; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 4-6; AE I, L, M, M-5, M-
6)
Applicant paid the $56 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.m. He denied owing the $1,560
debt owed to a telecommunications company (SOR ¶ 1.i). He stated that the company
charged him after he cancelled service, and they refused to accept his cell phone back.
He  disputed  the  debt  with  the  credit  reporting  agencies,  but  the  debt  continues  to  be
listed on his credit reports. (Tr. at 81-82, 85-87; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 4-6;
AE H, M-1, M-5, M-6)
Applicant denied owing the $2,250 medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.n. He stated
that it is not listed on his credit reports; he did not recognize the creditor; and he did not
know  what  the  debt  was  for.  The  debt  is  listed  by  Experian  on  the  August  2017
combined  credit  report.  It  is  not  listed  on  any  of  the  subsequent  credit  reports  in
evidence. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 4-6; AE M-5, M-6)
Applicant  stated  that  he  paid  the  $134  and  $76  medical  debts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.l  and
1.o). The creditors for the debts are listed simply as “MEDICAL” on the 2017 and 2018
credit  reports.  He  documented  a  $150  payment  to  a  creditor  in  September  2018.  The
$134  debt  is  not  listed  on  any  credit  report  after  May  2018.  The  $76  debt  is  listed  by
Equifax on the August 2017 combined credit report, but it is not listed on the May 2018
and March 2019 Equifax credit reports. There is a $76 medical debt listed in the August
2019 Equifax credit report, which may correspond to the debt alleged in the SOR. (Tr. at
90; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 4-6; AE M, M-5, M-6, M-7)
Applicant  stated  that  he  has  payment  plans  of  $60  each  per  month  for  the  last
two  medical  debts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.p  -  $6,468  and  1.q  -  $1,319).  He  documented  a  $50
payment in September 2018 to the creditor identified in SOR ¶ 1.q. The debts are listed
by  Experian  on  the  August  2017  combined  credit  report.  They  are  not  listed  on  any
subsequent credit report. (Tr. at 85, 90; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 4-6; AE M, M-
5, M-6, M-7)
Applicant  paid  or  has  payment  plans  for  all  but  one  of  the  non-medical  debts
alleged  in  the  SOR.  He  has  reduced  the  total amount  owed  on  the  non-medical  debts
from almost $41,000 to about $32,300. The status of the medical debts is unclear, but
his most recent credit report only lists one $76 medical debt. He credibly testified that he
is committed to paying all the debts that he legitimately owes. (Tr. at 15, 47-48, 88, 93-
98)
Applicant  has  worked  as  a  linguist  in  support  of  the  U.S.  military  in  the  Middle
East  since  February  2018.  He  submitted  documents  and  a  letter  from  U.S.  military
personnel  attesting  to  his  excellent  job  performance,  professionalism,  commitment,
expertise,  dedication,  and  positive  attitude,  which  “were  critical  to  the  success  of  the
mission.” (AE B, C)
