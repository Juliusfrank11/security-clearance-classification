The SOR alleges under Guideline  H that Applicant used marijuana with varying
frequency from July 2000 to at least February 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.a), and that he indicated
during a December 20, 2017 interview with an authorized investigator for the Office of
Personnel Management (OPM) that there was a likelihood that his illegal drug use would
reoccur (SOR ¶ 1.b). (Item 1.) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he had
used marijuana from 2000 to 2018, but he had “no intent to repeat [his] transgressions.” He
explained that his marijuana use ceased in February 2018, and that he wants to be a good
role model for his son born in August 2018. Applicant also admitted that he had indicated in
December 2017 that his drug use was likely to reoccur, but he reiterated that he would not
use any illegal drugs. (Item 2.)
After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant’s Answer to the SOR (Item 2),
I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is a 32-year-old high school graduate with two semesters of college. He
attended college from  September 2005 to January 2006 and from September 2008 to
January 2009. He has yet to earn a degree. He has worked for his defense-contractor
employer since September 2008. In April 2014, Applicant began cohabiting with his spouse
in her home. They married in June 2015, and they had a son in August 2018. (Items 2-3.)
On  August  9,  2017,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86.) In response to an inquiry concerning
the illegal use of a drug or controlled substance in the last seven years, Applicant indicated
that  he  used  marijuana  for  the  first  time  in  college  in  September  2005.  He  gave  an
estimated date of July 2017 for his most recent use and explained that he had attended a
comedy show with his family and his cousin gave him “infused drinks.” Applicant denied
any intention of future illegal drug use, and added, “I plan on starting a family with my wife.
My kid needs the best of me.” Applicant denied any involvement in other illegal drug activity
in the last seven years, including any purchase. (Item 3.)
On December 20, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator, in part
about his drug use. He described himself as a social smoker. He reportedly indicated that
he first used marijuana at age “10” and most recently in July 2017 at the comedy show,
when he had drinks infused with marijuana. He explained that he used marijuana once to
twice  year  except  when  he  was  in  college,  when  he  used  marijuana  twice  a  month  at
fraternity  events.  He  denied  ever purchasing  marijuana.  He  admitted  that  there  was  a
likelihood that he would use marijuana in the future. Applicant volunteered that he had
received an email two months before his interview in which he was informed of declination
of an interim clearance for him. He indicated that he was given a list of possible reasons for
the denial but not a specific reason. (Item 4.)
Applicant was interviewed by another OPM investigator on February 14, 2018. He
indicated that he was a former marijuana smoker. He denied any use of marijuana since
May or June 2017 and any chance of future use. (Item 4.)
DOHA sent Applicant interrogatories concerning his illegal drug use. In his response
dated July 24, 2018, Applicant indicated that he used cannabis from July 2000 to February
2018 once a year. He admitted that he had used marijuana after applying for a security
clearance and stated, “The last big party before I have my son, wanted to go out for my last
hooray before parenthood.” He cited the upcoming birth of his son in August 2018 as the
precipitant in his decision to stop using marijuana because he needs to set an example for
his son. Applicant explained that his wife could verify his abstention. In the interrogatories,
Applicant  was  given  an  opportunity  to  review  the  summary  of  his December 20,  2017
interview. He adopted it without any changes. (Item 4.) It is unclear whether his use of
marijuana in February 2018 occurred before his February 14, 2018 interview.
When he responded to the SOR on September 26, 2018, Applicant indicated that
his son was born in mid-August 2018. He denied any use of marijuana since February
2018 and asserted that raising his son has become his “number one goal.” (Item 2.)
