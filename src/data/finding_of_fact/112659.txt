Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 39 years old. She earned a bachelor’s degree in 2003. She married in
2006  and  has  one  child  born  in  2017.  She  has  been  employed  by  the  same  federal
contractor since 2004.1
Applicant disclosed on her December 2016 security clearance application (SCA)
the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a-$18,298; 1.b-$12,550; and 1.c-$7978).
The  debts  became  delinquent  in  approximately  2011  or  2012.  Applicant  attributed  her
financial  problems  to  the  loss  of  her  husband’s  job  in  2011,  and  mismanaging  her
finances. With regard to the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c, she stated she made a decision
to pay other bills and would pay these debts when she was more financially stable. She
said she did not become financially stable until 2015. Subsequently the creditors stopped
contacting her, and she did not follow up to resolve these debts. With regard to the debt
in SOR ¶ 1.a, she stated she intended to contact the creditor and arrange a payment plan.
This debt was charged off in 2012. Applicant stated: “Since 2011, I have tried to make a
better effort at being more responsible with my finances and am more financially stable
now.  Please  consider  that  I  am  trying  to  take  responsibility  for  my  previous  financial
mistakes.”2
In February 2017, Applicant’s son was born prematurely and was required to stay
in  the  hospital  for  10  weeks.  Applicant  had  a  high  medical  insurance  deductible  and
incurred medical expenses. She has paid them.3
In August 2017, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. She told
the investigator that the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c were personal loans she obtained
in 2009 and used for general expenses. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.a was a credit card that she
obtained  in  2010  for  general  expenses.  At  the  time,  both  she  and  her  husband  were

employed. Her husband lost his job in 2011, and their financial situation became tighter.
She stated that she had not made any attempt to repay these loans or the credit card, but
intended to do so by 2018 because her husband had resumed working.4
In  Applicant’s answer  to  the  SOR,  she  reiterated that  the  loss  of  her  husband’s
income in 2011 impacted their finances. They moved into her mother’s house, but their
debts exceeded her income. The premature birth of her son in February 2017, and his
high  medical  expenses,  also  impacted  her  finances,  but  she  has  managed  to  pay  the
medical debts. She said that over the past seven years she has managed their money
better and they were living within their means. She stated: “After I have been caught up
on paying off my current bills, I have every intention of repaying my past debts.”5
In Applicant’s December 2018 response to the FORM, she stated that her current
financial priority is to make payments on a home equity loan on her mother’s house where
Applicant, her husband, and child live. She has been making payments on this loan since
2006. She stated, “Even though I mentioned my husband and I became more financially
stable in 2015 due to his new job, I admit I did not try and resolve my past debts because
I was able to pay more down on the Home Equity Loan during 2015 and 2016.”6 She also
was paying medical expenses for her son.7
Applicant stated that she has a balance of about $18,000 on credit card accounts
that are current. She and her mother are joint owners on one of the cards, and she and
her husband are joint owners on another. Applicant confirmed that she took vacation trips
in October 2014, June 2016, and October 2016. She explained that her mother paid for
the  2014  trip.  The  other  two  trips  were  part  of  a  free  all-inclusive  resort  package.  Her
mother  paid  for  the  airfare  for  the  June  2016  trip,  and  Applicant  paid  for  her  and  her
husband’s  airfare  for  the  October  2016  trip.  She  admitted  she  did  not  act  responsibly
when  she  owed  delinquent  debts.  Applicant  stated  that  she  wants  to  resolve  her
delinquent debts, but did not want to overextend her finances at this time. She said that
she needs more time and is hoping to resolve the debts sometime in 2019.
Applicant did not provide information on her or her husband’s income; the amount
she  is  paying  toward  the  home  equity  loan;  whether  she  has  contacted  any  of  her
creditors; whether she has a budget; or why she failed to address the delinquent debts
after she became more financially stable in 2015, before her son was born. Applicant’s
admissions  and  credit  reports  from  March  2017  and  April  2018  corroborate  the  debts
alleged in the SOR.8
