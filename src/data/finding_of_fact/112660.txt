Applicant,  72,  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  a  federal  contractor  since
January 2017. He served in the U.S Navy from 1965 to  1969 as a Navy Seal and is a
combat veteran. Applicant does not require a security clearance for his current position,
but  eligibility  would  increase  his  job  prospects  and  earning  potential.  Applicant
completed  a  security  clearance  application,  his  first,  in  December  2017.  The  ensuing
investigation  revealed  that  Applicant  owes  $168,000  in  federal  taxes  for  the  2011
through 2015 tax years, which is alleged in the SOR. Though unalleged, the record also
revealed  that  in  2014,  Applicant  resolved  a $96,509 federal tax  lien  for unpaid federal
income taxes from 2008 to 2010. (GE 1; Tr. 34.)
Applicant  incurred federal tax  debt  because  he did  not  withhold federal or state
income  taxes  from  his  pay  from  2004  to  2015.  Applicant  lived  and  worked  overseas
between  2004  and  2014  (with  the  exception  of  one  year  between  2009  and  2010),
earning  approximately  $200,000  annually.  Although  he  timely  filed  his  income  tax
returns,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  could  not  afford  his  tax  liabilities  because  he  lived
beyond  his  means  and  prioritized  other  expenses  to  support  his  lifestyle.  Between
January and July 2015, Applicant paid $4,000 each month toward his federal tax debt.
He was laid off in August 2015 and could no longer afford to make any payments. When
he returned to work in January 2017, he did not immediately resume payments on his
federal  tax  debt  because  he  was  focused  on  other  financial  obligations,  including  a
wage  garnishment  for  a  $20,000  child  support  arrearage,  a  $20,000  state  income  tax
debt for the years 2011 to 2015, and a student loan payment. Applicant established an
installment agreement with the IRS in June 2018, under which he agreed to pay $500
each month. According to the record, Applicant made one payment in September 2018.
He  did  not  provide  evidence  of  ongoing  compliance  with  the  installment  agreement.
(Answer; GE 2; Tr. 17-19, 22, 22-25, 27-31, 38-39, 43, 60-67.)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  intends  to  resolve  his  tax  debt  by
doubling  his monthly payments  to $1,000  per month.  However, he  cannot afford  to do
so. Applicant earns approximately $94,000 annually and receives $24,000 each year in
social  security  income.  He  supports  a  family  of  five,  including  his  wife  and  his  three
minor  children  from  another  relationship.  After  paying  his  familyâ€™s  living  expenses  and
his other recurring financial obligations, Applicant has no disposable income. At hearing,
Applicant  stated  that  he  intends  to  satisfy  his  federal  tax  debt  by  selling  property  he
owns  in  Country  1,  valued  at  $600,000  (USD).  However, the  co-owner of  the property
refuses to consent to the sale. Applicant has retained an attorney based in Country 1 to
help resolve this issue and sell the home. (Tr. 26, 36-38, 40-42, 50-58, 70-72, 75-78.)
Applicant  timely  filed  his  2017  and  2018  income  tax  returns.  He  owes
approximately $4,200 in federal taxes for 2018 and expects a $1,700 refund of his state
taxes.  He  plans  to  pay  the  2018  balance  by  withdrawing  money  from  his  retirement
savings and cash savings. (Tr. 73-75.)
