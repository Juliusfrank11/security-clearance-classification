Applicant  is  56  years  old.  He  served  honorably  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  1980  to
1994.  Applicant  has  been  employed  as  a  senior  systems  administrator  by  a  federal
contractor since November 2016. He disclosed that he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy
protection in January 2010, in section 26 of his SCA. Applicant had a previous security
clearance from July 2007. Applicant married in 1980, and he has two adult children.
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  filed  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  petitions  in  April
1999, discharged in August 2001 (¶ 1.a); in January 2010, dismissed in October 2011
for failure to make payments (¶ 1.b); and again in April 2012, dismissed in August 2016.
Applicant admitted all of these filings in his answer to the SOR in August 2018. (Item 2)
He  also  admitted  to  a  mortgage  account  that  is  past  due  (¶  1.d)  and  eleven  medical
delinquencies totaling $1,492 placed for collection. (¶ 1.e - 1.o) He states in his answer,
that  with  respect  to  SOR  ¶  1.c,  there  were  arrears  owed  on  his  mortgage  loan  that
couldn’t  be  discharged.  On advice  of  counsel,  he  voluntarily  dismissed  the bankruptcy
case  to  try  to  work  out  a  modification  on  his  mortgage  loan.  That  loan  was  sold  to
another  company  and  is  now  reflected  in  SOR  ¶  1.d  and  it  remains  delinquent  with  a
past-due amount of $30,794. (Item 6)
In  his  personal  subject  interview  (PSI),  Applicant  stated  that  he  fell  behind
financially when he took a $25,000 pay cut after leaving his job as a network engineer,
from  1996  to  2008,  at  a  previous  employer.  He  left  to  look  for  other  employment
opportunities.  He  became  employed  almost  immediately  as  a  computer  technician.
(Item 3) All of his creditors listed in his 2010 Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, were satisfied
by  2014  and  the bankruptcy  case  was  ready  to  be discharged,  but  he  could not  get a
modification  on  his  mortgage  loan.  He  fell  behind  on  mortgage  payments,  which  were
$768 a month at that time. (Item 4) He was $23,000 in arrears when the loan was sold
to another mortgagee. Applicant offered no plan for resolving this arrearage.
Applicant’s  wife  fell  down  and  sustained  injuries  in  July  2017.  (Item  4)  She
incurred  medical  bills  reflected  at  SOR  ¶¶  1.e  to  1.o,  totaling  $1,492,  that  were
apparently not covered by health insurance. Applicant claims in his answer to the SOR,
that he made payments to the creditor on each of these that resolved the alleged debts.
He  provided  confirmation  numbers  as  well,  which  were  not  helpful.  He  provided  no
documentation to substantiate his assertions in his Answer and show that these medical
debts were resolved.
Applicant’s 2010 Chapter 13 bankruptcy case documents include a statement of
current monthly income and calculations of disposable income.2 This reflects Applicant’s

monthly  gross  earnings  of  $4,948,  and  his  wife’s  gross  earnings  of  $1,318.  Their
combined residuary or disposable income each month was negative $140 in April 2012.
Applicant  provided  no  response  to  the  FORM  or  evidence  that  he  received
financial counseling. He provided no budget showing income against expenses, or other
documentation  to  show  progress  on  his  delinquent  debts.  He  discussed  his  wife’s
medical  care  and  resulting  bills  and  his  intentions  to  repay  these  medical  debts  in  his
PSI  in  December  2017.  He  produced  no  documentary  evidence  that  he  has  done  so
beyond  the  naked  assertions  in  his  answer.  He  provided  no  character  references  or
performance evaluations.
