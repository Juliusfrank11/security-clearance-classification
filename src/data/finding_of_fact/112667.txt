Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  financial  allegations.  He  is  a  30-year-old  field
technician  employed  by  a  U.S.  defense  contractor  since  April  2017.  He  served
honorably  in  the  United  States  military  from  June  2001  until  February  2007,  when  he
was  discharged  in  paygrade  E-5.  He  has  been  divorced  since  December  2017.  He
previously held a clearance while in the military. (Item 3).
The  SOR  alleges,  Government  exhibits  (Items  2-5)  establish,  and  Applicant
admits three delinquent debts totaling over $27,000. The debts comprise two delinquent
education loans totaling over $15,000 and a delinquent automobile loan totaling nearly
$12,000.
Applicant  disclosed  no  financial  issues  on  his  November 2017  application  for  a
public trust position (Item 3), but was confronted with the SOR debts during his March
2018  interview  with  a  Government  investigator  (Item  4).  He  stated  that  his  ex-wife
obtained the automobile loan in his name (in May 2011).  He stated he was unaware of
this  delinquency  until  he  was  confronted  with  it  during  his  interview.  Similarly,  he
acknowledged  that  the  education  loans  were  his,  but  stated  that  he  had  received  no
delinquency notices and was unaware of the delinquencies until he was confronted with
them during the interview. Nevertheless, he stated his intent to contact the creditors and
arrange payments or otherwise resolve the debts.
However,  Applicant  has  documented  no  contacts  with  his  creditors  since  his
March 2018 interview. Moreover, he provided no budget or financial statement. He has
not  documented  any  financial  or  credit  counseling.  He  provided  no  work  or  character
references, or any evidence of community involvement.
