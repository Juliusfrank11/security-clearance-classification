Applicant, 57, is currently being sponsored for access to classified information by
two federal contracting companies seeking to hire him.  Applicant served in the military
from  1979  to  1999,  when  he  retired  as  a  master  sergeant.  He  served  as  an  Army
Ranger,  a  Green  Beret,  a  freefall  instructor,  and  an  instructor  at  the  Joint  Special
Operations  Command.  After  his  retirement,  Applicant  worked  as  an  employee  of  a
federal contracting company where he was granted access to classified information by
another government agency in 2000. He completed his most recent security clearance
application  in  March  2016,  disclosing  outstanding  federal  income  taxes  and  five
delinquent  accounts.  The  resulting  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  owes  $100,411  in
outstanding federal income taxes and $209,252 on three delinquent accounts.  (Tr. 21-
25, 37; GE 1, 2, 4-5; AE A, K.)
Between  2000  and  2009,  Applicant  lived  and  worked  in  State  1.  He  was
financially  secure.  He  lived  within  his  means,  earning  sufficient  money  to  support  his
family,  accumulate  retirement  savings,  and  comfortably  afford  some  luxury  items.  In
April  2009,  Applicant  was  laid  off.  Since  then,  he  has  had  a  sporadic  employment
history, experiencing unexpected job losses followed by periods of unemployment and
underemployment.  In May 2009, he accepted a long-term consulting job that  required
frequent cross-country travel between State 1 and State 2. Unable to sell their home in
State  1  because  of  the  depressed  real  estate  market,  Applicant  rented  out  the  home.
From  April  2009  to  January  2010,  Applicant,  his  wife,  and  daughter  used  their
recreational vehicle (RV) as their primary residence and primary means of cross-country
travel. However, in May 2010, Applicant’s employer decided not to renew the contract.
(Tr. 30-31, 41-42, 108-109; GE 1, 4-5; AE H.)
Applicant  secured  another  job  in  June  2010,  working  on  a  five-year  contract  in
the  Middle  East.  The  position  paid  $250,000  annually,  which  Applicant  accepted
because  he  believed  the  earnings  would  ensure  his  family’s  financial  security  for  the
future.  However,  in  December  2012,  Applicant’s  employer  abruptly  cancelled  the
contract  and  Applicant  returned  to  the  United  States.  Applicant  admits  that  he
mishandled  his  federal  income  tax  obligations  by  failing  to  properly  withhold  federal
income taxes while he was working abroad, resulting in the tax liability alleged in SOR ¶
1.a for the 2010 and 2011 tax years. (Tr. 31-32; GE 1; AE H.)
Applicant  was  unemployed  for  six  months  and  used  credit  cards  and  his
retirement  savings  to  support  his  family.  He  found  employment  with  a  federal
contracting  company  from  July  2012  to  October  2014.  In  the  two  years  he  held  his
position, Applicant attempted to rehabilitate his finances. In December 2012, he enrolled
in  a  debt-relief  program  with  the  intention  of  resolving  $64,000  of  credit  card  debt  he
incurred during his previous periods of unemployment. Applicant settled two credit card
accounts through the program. He stopped participating in the program after he was laid
off again in October 2014. (Tr. 32 -33; GE 1; AE H-I.)
Applicant  was  unemployed for  six  months. During  this period  of  unemployment,
Applicant’s financial problems became acute. In 2015, still unable the sell their home in
State  1,  the  bank  foreclosed  on  the  property.  The  mortgage  lender  cancelled  the
remaining  debt.  Without  any  income,  Applicant  realized  he  could  not  afford  the
payments  on  the  RV.  Although  the  account  was  current,  Applicant  proactively
surrendered  the  vehicle  to  the  creditor.  According  to  Applicant,  the  creditor  sold  the
vehicle at auction and forgave any deficiency balance. The credit reports in the record
shows  that  the  creditor  charged  off  the  loan  balance,  $176,062,  in  March  2015.
Although the loan amount is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e, the credit reports show the account
as  having  no  balance  due.    It  does  not  appear  that  the  account  was  purchased  by  or
transferred  to  a  collection  agency.  Nor  does  the  record  indicate  that  the  creditor  has
made  any  efforts  to  collect  any  deficiency  balance  associated  with  the  voluntary
surrender.  (Tr. 44-46; Ge 1, 4-5; AE L-M.)
In  May  2015,  Applicant  began  working  on  short-term  contracts  for  a  federal
contracting company. The contracts lasted a few weeks or a few months, depending on
the  nature  of  the  work.  Although  he  was  earning  some  income,  it  was  not  enough  to
support  his  family.  This  contracting  arrangement  continued  until  November  2018.
Applicant  stated  at  the  hearing  that  between  2009  and  2015,  he  accumulated
approximately  $50,000  in  credit  card  debt,  including  the  credit  card  debts  alleged  in
SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.d.  He  also  stated  that  he  exhausted  his  $250,000  in  retirement
savings, resulting in the 2015 income tax obligation alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. However, he
provided evidence of his efforts to resolve to the alleged accounts. (Tr. 34, 44; GE 1; AE
M.)
Applicant  established  an  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS  for  the  2010  and
2011  tax  liabilities  in  2011.  He  made  is  first  payment  in  November  2011  and  has  not
missed  a  payment.  In  2018,  Applicant’s  CPA  filed  an  amended  income  tax  return  for
2015,  which  resulted  in  an  $11,476  reduction  in  tax  liability  for  that  year.  Applicant
currently  owes  $14,202  (including  $3,121  in  penalties  and  interest)  for  the  2015  tax
year,  not  $27,329  as  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Applicant’s  current  installment  agreement
covers the 2010, 2011, and 2015 tax years. According to documentation from the IRS,
Applicant  made  $100  monthly  payments  between  November  2011  and  January  2017.
The  monthly  payment  amount  increased  to  $200  between  February  2017  and  June
2017. Since July 2017, Applicant has made monthly payments of $291. He continued to
make the agreed-upon payments during his periods of unemployment. To date, the IRS
has applied these payments to the 2010 balance, which is $45,888 including $25,239 in
interest and penalties. Applicant’s outstanding balance for the 2011 tax year is $52,811,
including $18,226 in interest and penalties. (AE H, J, N.)
Applicant opened the credit card alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c in 1987. He attempted to
resolve the debt through the debt-relief program, but the creditor declined to participate.
The account remained open until July 2014, when the creditor closed the account and
no  longer  accepted  payments  from  Applicant.  The  account,  which  currently  has  a
balance  of  $4,406,  remains  unresolved.  The  creditor  holding  the  account  alleged  in
SOR  ¶  1.d  cancelled  the  debt,  forgiving  $26,315  in  debt  in  2015.  Because  he  was
insolvent, there was no tax liability associated with the canceled debt. (Tr. 46-48; AE H-
I, M.)
Between  December  2018  and  April  2019,  Applicant  worked  as  a  temporary
employee  for  a  small  company.  He  has  been  unemployed  since  May  2019.  His  only
source  of  income  is  his  military  retirement  and  disability  pay,  which  is  approximately
$2,000 each month.  (Tr. 25, 34-35, 49, 73.)
