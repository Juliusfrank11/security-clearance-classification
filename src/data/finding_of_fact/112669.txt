In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations except SOR ¶
1.f, which he denied. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in
my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 28-year-old research analyst employed by a federal contractor since
April 2016.  He  served  on active  duty  in  the U.S.  Navy  from  February  2012  to  January
2016. He was unemployed for about one month after being discharged from the Navy.
He  worked  in  a  temporary  position  for  two  months  before  being  hired  by  his  current
employer. He married in December 2011 and has a four-year-old daughter. He received
a security clearance in July 2012.
The  SOR  alleges  13  delinquent  debts,  which  are  reflected  in  Applicant’s  credit
reports from June 2019, September 2018, November 2017, and October 2017. (GX 3-6.)
The evidence concerning the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR  ¶  1.a:  credit-card  debt  charged  off  for  $1,367.  This  credit  card  was  in
Applicant’s wife’s name and he was an authorized user. (Tr. 36.) The last payment on the
debt  was  in  July  2016,  and  it  was  charged  off  in  August  2016.  (GX  3  at  2.)  Applicant
settled this debt for $615 in June 2019. (AX A; A B.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c: student loans past due for $795, with a balance of $8,234;
and  past  due  for  $337,  with  a  balance  of  $3,747.  These  loans  were  approved  for
administrative forbearance in July 2019. (AX M.)
SOR ¶ 1.d: collection account for $1,267. This debt was reduced to judgment in
March 2018, and it was satisfied in January 2019. (AX E; Tr. 21.) The debt was collected
in full by garnishment. (Tr. 57.)
SOR ¶ 1.e: credit-card debt charged off for $4,667. This account was opened
in March 2012, charged off in October 2017, and settled in June 2019. (GX 3 at 3; GX 5
at 3; AX F.)
SOR ¶ 1.f: collection account for $669. Applicant denied this debt. He testified
that he asked the collection agency to identify the original creditor, and it was unable to
provide the information. (Tr. 23.) Applicant made no further effort before the hearing to
resolve this debt, and he had no further communications with the collection agency. (Tr.
44.) After the hearing, he attempted to obtain information from the collection agency about
the identity of the original creditor, but without success. (AX N.) He has not disputed the
debt  with  the  credit  bureaus.  The  debt  is  a duplicate  of  the debt  alleged  in  SOR ¶  1.i,
discussed below.
SOR ¶ 1.g: home-improvement debt charged off for $5,258. As of the date of
the  hearing,  Applicant  had  contacted  the  creditor,  who  agreed  to  settle  the  debt  for
$2,200. Applicant is awaiting receipt of an educational grant of $3,000, and he testified
that he intends to use to it settle the debt. (Tr. 24, 45.) The debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.h:  auto  loan  debt  past  due  for  $190,  with  a  balance  of  $2,671.
Applicant made a payment on this debt on June 3, 2019, and the account is now current.
(AX J.)
SOR ¶ 1.i: dental bill charged off for $668. Applicant testified that this debt and
the collection account in SOR ¶ 1.f are the same debt, but that the collection agency did
not comply with a request to identify the original creditor. (Tr. 23.) Applicant admitted that
he knew he had debts to a specific dentist for care received by his wife, but he disagrees
with the amount claimed by the collection agency. (Tr. 55.) He submitted no documentary
evidence  showing  the  basis  for  his  dispute  and  he  presented  no  evidence  of  direct
contacts with the dentist, even though he knows that the dentist is the original creditor.
He has not disputed the debt with the credit bureaus. The debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.j:  credit-card  debt  past  due  for  $956  with  a  balance  of  $7,242.
Applicant and his wife incurred this debt to pay for moving expenses and purchases of
household  items  after  they  moved  to  their  current  home.  They  opened  the  account  in
October 2013 and made their last payment in October 2014. (GX 3 at 4-5.)The creditor
obtained a judgment against Applicant and garnished his pay for about $900 per month.
After  the  balance  was  reduced  to  about  $2,000  by  garnishment,  Applicant  settled  this
debt for $500 in June 2019. (AX C; AX D; Tr. 50.)
SOR  ¶  1.k-1.m:  federal  government  debts  for  $4,161;  $1,593;  and  $125.
Applicant testified that these debts were for GI Bill overpayments, and they were satisfied
by diversion of his federal income tax refunds, except for $20, which he paid. (Tr. 26.)
Once the debts were satisfied, his GI Bill entitlements were reinstated. (AX L.)
Applicant provided documentary evidence that three delinquent debts not alleged
in the SOR were resolved. The creditor for two of the debts is the same creditor as alleged
in SOR ¶ 1.e. (AX G, H, N, and O.)
Applicant earns about $58,000 per year in his current job. In addition, he is a full-
time college student, taking classes at night, and he receives GI Bill entitlements of $1,550
per month for housing. (AX K; Tr. 27.) He has not received formal financial counseling.
He  and  his  wife  use  a  budgeting  application  on  their  computer  to  track  income  and
expenses. (Tr. 35.)
