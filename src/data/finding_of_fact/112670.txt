against  Applicant  in  March  2016  (SOR  ¶  1.c:  Item  4);  a  $12,526  garnishment  order
entered  against  Applicant  in  January  2017  for  a  delinquent  student  loan  (SOR  ¶  1.d:

8 at 7; Item 11 at 3). In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to the allegations in
SOR ¶¶ 1.c -1.d, and denies the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b and 1.e.  With regard to
the tax debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, Applicant admits she owes the federal tax
debts. She disputes the total amount owed. (Item 2)
In her response to the SOR, Applicant addressed each allegation as follows:
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, federal tax liens in the respective amounts of $51,434 and
$23,325:    Applicant  denies  the  amounts  of  the  federal  tax  lien.  She  states  that  the
current  amount  owed  to  the  federal  government  is  $41,845.  She  claims  the  debt  was
incurred because of unsatisfactory service from a former tax representative for tax years
2006 to 2010. She is current on all tax filings and owes no federal taxes for tax years
after  2010.  In  August  2018,  she  retained  a  tax  law  firm  to  submit  an  Offer  in
Compromise on her behalf. The tax debt will be paid in full if the Offer in Compromise is
approved.  She  did  not  provide  proof  of  the  current  balance  of  her  federal  income  tax
such as an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) transcript. (Item 2 at 1, 3)
SOR  ¶  1.c:  state  tax  lien  in  the  amount  of  $6,975:    Applicant  admits  this  debt.
She  is  currently  paying  in  a  monthly  installment  agreement.  She  pays  $147.73  each
month. It is not clear when the installment agreement began. The balance as of July 30,
2018,  was  $6,499.  Applicant  did  not  provide  additional proof  of  payments  towards  the
monthly installment agreement. (Item 2 at 1, 4)
SOR ¶ 1.d: $12,526 garnishment entered in January 2017:  Applicant denies this
debt because she disputes the $12,526 balance. She claims her wages were garnished
in  the  amount  of  $7,315.  She  claims  she  entered  a  successful  loan  payment  program
agreement  in  January  2018.  She  provided  a  statement  from  the  Department  of
Education, dated September 12, 2017, indicating she successfully completed a student
loan  rehabilitation  program.  Her  loan  is  now  being  processed  for  a  new  repayment
program.  She  did  not  provide  additional  evidence  about  the  repayment  program  and
proof  that  she  is  making  timely  monthly  payments  towards  the  program.  It  is  unclear
whether the garnishment order was satisfied. (Item 2 at 2, 5)

with a credit reporting agency, denying that it was her debt. The debt was successfully
removed from her credit report. (Item 2 at 1, 6)
