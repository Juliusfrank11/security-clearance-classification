Applicant  is  a  56-year-old  special  investigator  employed  by  a  federal  contractor
since  May  2018.  She  earned  her  practical  nurse  license  in  1985  and  her  bachelor’s
degree  in  2017.  She  and  her  husband  married  in  1986  and  have  two  adult  children.
Applicant’s husband retired from the Army in 2000. (Tr. 27-28.) This is Applicant’s first
application for a security clearance. (GX 1.)
The SOR alleges two debts: a charged-off vehicle-loan account for $38,717 and a
charged-off  personal  loan  for  $8,506.  Applicant  admits  both  of  the  allegations.  The
delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant’s April 2019 and January 2018 credit bureau
reports  (CBR)  (GX  4;  GX  2),  and  discussed  in  her  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)
summary  (GX  5)  and  responses  to  interrogatories  (GX  3).  Applicant’s  admissions  are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
The  $38,717  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  is a  loan for a  recreational vehicle  that
Applicant  co-signed  with  her  husband  in  August  2005  for  about  $71,800.  They  made
payments of approximately $591 per month until December 2015. Earlier in 2015, they
experienced a tire blowout and subsequent accident. The insurance company assessed
the vehicle as a total loss. The loan holder, which had purchased the vehicle loan in 2013
or 2014, demanded full repayment of the loan balance. Applicant’s husband attempted to
negotiate  a  settlement  with  the  loan  holder,  but  was  unable  to  do  so.  He  eventually
stopped making payments and the vehicle was voluntarily repossessed. According to the
loan  holder,  the  vehicle  was  sold  for  $17,000.  However,  the  loan  holder  continued  to
demand  the  entire  balance  from  Applicant  and  her  husband.  Applicant’s  husband
continued to attempt to negotiate a settlement with the loan holder. He made a payment
of  $125  in  April  2018  with  the  intention  of  showing  a  good-faith  effort  to  reach  an
agreement. (Tr. 22-24; GX 3.) The loan holder offered a settlement of $15,000 to be paid
at $625 a month for 24 months. Applicant’s husband made a counter offer of a $4,000
lump-sum settlement, which the loan holder rejected. Applicant and her husband have
not had any contact with the loan holder since April 2018. Applicant has not taken any
independent action to resolve this debt because her husband has taken responsibility for
resolving this account. (GX 5; Tr. 30.)
In 2013, Applicant took out a personal loan to help her daughter pay for college.
Several months later, Applicant’s hours at her job were cut from full-time to part-time and
she was unable to afford the loan payments. After approximately six or seven months,
Applicant  entered  a  repayment  plan  with  the  creditor  to  pay  $75  a  month,  which  was
automatically  drafted  from  Applicant’s  checking  account.  Applicant  made  her  final
payment in June 2018. (GX 3; Tr. 18-19.)
Applicant’s CBRs show a credit history that dates back to 1994, that includes paid
off lines of credit, vehicle loans, and credit cards. She is current with repayment of her
student loans. Applicant refinanced her mortgage loan in 2017, and she has timely made
all payments with the current and previous mortgage-loan holders since purchasing the
house in 2000. (GX 4; GX 2.) Applicant invests in a 401(k), and she and her husband
have several certificates of deposit and other investments. She  lives within her means
and is fiscally stable and responsible. (Tr. 50-51.) Applicant was straightforward, sincere,
and credible in her testimony.
