Applicant admitted to the one allegation of the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  37-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  page  5.)
He has been employed with the defense contractor since 2004, and has held a security
clearance since 2013. (TR at page 18 line 16 to page 21 line 5.)
Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption
1.a.  Applicant  started  drinking  alcohol  “regularly”  in  2006.  (TR  at  page  27  lines
1~6.)  Until  2006,  his  regular  consumption  would  be  about  “eight  drinks”  at  one  sitting.
(TR  at  page  27  line  17  to  page  28  line  4.)  That  consumption  “increased  both  in
frequency  and  in  quantity”  in  “about  2008.”  (TR  at  page  28  lines  5~20.)  In  2013,
Applicant was diagnosed as suffering from “fatty liver disease,” but Applicant continued
to  consume  alcohol.  (TR  at  page  29  lines  1~24.)  His  treating  physician  thought
Applicant  was  drinking  excessively;  and  as  a  result,  “advised  .  .  .  [Applicant]  to  quit
drinking.” (Id.) However, Applicant continued to consume alcohol.
From September of 2013 until January of 2014, Applicant received treatment for
his  liver  disease.  (TR  at  page  33  line  3  to  page  34  line  23.)  There  he  “learned  a  lot
about  alcohol,  alcoholism,  or  alcohol  addiction.”  (Id.)  As  a  result,  Applicant  abstained
from  alcohol  consumption  until  May  of  2014.  (TR  at  page  34  lines  15~23.)  He  then
returned to its consumption, “more than approximately six drinks at the time during the
week. On the weekend . . . it was variable but would tend towards more 10 drinks at a
time.”  (TR  at  page  37  line  18  to  page  38  line  3.)  In  October  of  2015,  and  again  in
February of 2018, Applicant was diagnosed as suffering from an “alcohol use disorder,
moderate.”  (GXs  4  and  5.)  However,  Applicant  continued  to  consume  alcohol  until
August of 2018, a month after the issuance of the SOR. (TR at page 18 lines 1~8.) In
the last seven months, Applicant has been committed to his alcohol abuse recovery, as
evidenced by his authored progress reports. (AppXs B~D.)
