In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  senior  network  engineer  employed  by  a  federal
contractor  since  October  2014.  He  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  July  2010,  and  he
previously  worked  for  federal  contractors  from  November  2012  to  March  2013.  He
married in June 2007 and has three children, ages 10, 7, and 6. He received a security
clearance in November 2010.
The  delinquent  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  are  reflected  in  a  credit  report  from
November 2015. (Item 8.) The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: mortgage loan in foreclosure with a balance of $317,952. Applicant
purchased a home in March 2007 for $328,000 and had an interest-only mortgage loan,
on which the payments were $2,000 per month. When his wife stopped working as a day-
care provider, they began having financial difficulties. He tried unsuccessfully to refinance
his  mortgage  loan.  His  mortgage  lender  went  bankrupt  and  the  loan  was  assumed  by
another lender. At the suggestion of a friend, Applicant enrolled in a debt-relief program
that  advised  him  to  challenge  the  lender’s  authority  to  collect  payments.  He  filed
documents in October and November 2011, demanding that the successor lender provide
proof of authority to collect the payments. There is no evidence that the lender responded.
Applicant stopped making payments and deposited $2,000 in an escrow account each
month.
In order to avoid foreclosure, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in
June 2012. The petition included the company servicing the mortgage loan and the credit-

card accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.g, and it indicated that the debts were disputed.
(Item 5.) The bankruptcy petition was dismissed in August 2012 when Applicant failed to
attend the creditors’ meeting. He filed another Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in October
2012.  After  the  bankruptcy  court  declined  to  approve  Applicant’s  payment  plan,  he
changed his mind about pursuing bankruptcy and requested that his petition be dismissed
without prejudice. The petition was dismissed in February 2013. This petition listed the
mortgage loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a and the credit-card accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e
and 1.g, and it indicated that the account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e was disputed. (Item 7.)
The two bankruptcies are alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i.
Applicant  sought  permission  from  the  loan  servicer  for  a  short  sale,  which  was
denied. (FORM Item 9.) The property was foreclosed, and it was sold in March 2016 to
another realtor. Applicant applied for and received relocation assistance from the buyer
and agreed to move out by April 30, 2016, in return for $3,000. (Item 10, Exhibit B-1.) The
record does not reflect the sale price for the home. A credit report from November 2015
reflected that the property was in foreclosure, with a balance due of $317,952. There is
no evidence in the record reflecting a deficiency after the foreclosure sale. Based on the
limited evidence in the record, the debt appears to be resolved.
SOR  ¶¶  1.b-1.g:  Credit-card  accounts  charged  off  for  $5,172;  $3,322;  and
$8,173; credit-card accounts placed for collection of $14,340; $12,707; and $6,072.
Applicant fell behind on credit-card payments at the same time as his mortgage loan, and
he  used  the  same  debt-relief  provider  to  dispute  these  six  debts.  His  provider  used  a
common practice of disputing every debt listed in a credit report, in the hope that some
debts  would  fall  off  the  credit  reports.  Applicant  did  not  challenge  the  validity  of  any
specific debts or assert specific errors underlying his delinquent debts. Instead, he made
general assertions asserting faulty accounting and lack of documentation. The accounts
in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g were disputed in November 2011. The accounts alleged in
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c were disputed in March 2012. The account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d was
disputed  in  July  2012.  The  credit  report  from  November  2015  reflects  that  the  debts
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f are disputed. There is no evidence that any of the
disputes have been resolved. After filing his disputes, Applicant admitted the debts during
the PSI in September 2017 and in his answer to the SOR in July 2018. In his response to
interrogatories  in  May  2018,  he  asserted  that  collection  of  the  debts  is  barred  by  the
statute of limitation. (Item 10.)
Applicant’s first bankruptcy petition did not reflect completion of the required credit
counseling, but his second petition reflected that it was completed in October 2012. In the
PSI,  he  stated  that  he  is  meeting  current  obligations,  but  he  provided  no  specific
information about his income and expenses.
