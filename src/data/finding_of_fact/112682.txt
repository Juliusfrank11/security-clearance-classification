Applicant denied the  SOR financial allegations, except SOR 1.a  and  1.d, which
she admitted. She is a 28-year-old prospective computer technician being sponsored by
a  defense  contractor  since  August  2017  (Tr.  75-77).  Her  employment  record  reveals
that she has been employed in a series of low-paying jobs since June 2007, including
her  most  recent  job.  She  has  never  married,  and  has  two  children,  from  separate
relationships,  who  receive  no  financial  support  from  their  fathers.  Applicant  receives
food and housing support from the state. She has not previously held a clearance.
The  SOR  alleges,  and  GE  1-7  substantiate,  nine  delinquent  debts  totaling over
$25,000.  Applicant  admits  two  debts  totaling  over  $16,000.  The  debts  comprise  two
vehicle  debts,  two  delinquent  education  loans,  two  delinquent  medical  bills,  two
delinquent consumer accounts and one delinquent utility bill. Applicant’s 2 August 2017
clearance  application  (GE  1)  disclosed  $3,754  in  education  loans  falling  delinquent  in
April  2015  and  being  resolved  in  February  2017.  On  26  November  2018—about  a
month  after  her  Answer—Applicant  filed  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  protection,  listing
SOR debts 1.a.-1.b and 1.d-1.g (GE 7). She qualified for waiver of the filing fee (AE D).
On 6 March 2019, her dischargeable debts were discharged (GE 6).
Applicant’s  education  loans  (SOR  1.e-1.f)  were  not  discharged.  She  had  been
making small, but regular, monthly payments between June and October 2018 (AE E),
but  stopped  the  payments  during  the  pendency  of  her  bankruptcy  (Tr.  62).  She  was
attempting to get a deferment or forbearance on these loans, but could not because at
the  time,  her  accounts  were  in  a  bankruptcy  status.  She  had  not  resubmitted  her
request because she felt she could make the required $27 monthly payment due in April
2019 (Tr. 63; AE E). She has not resumed monthly payments.
SOR  debt  1.c  may  be  a  duplicate  of  SOR  1.g,  which  was  discharged,  but  the
account numbers do not match. AE F shows that on 11 March 2019, Applicant paid a
$168.17  past-due  balance  to  the  SOR  1.I  creditor,  with  a  current  balance  of  $340.68
due by 29 March 2019.  Applicant has not documented the status of SOR debt 1.h.
For  the  eleven  bi-weekly  pay  periods  between  June  2018  and  October  2018,
Applicant  averaged  about  $425  per  payday.  Two  friends  of  long  standing  and  her
sister—who cites her holding a clearance for fourteen years—recommend Applicant for
her  clearance.  None  of  them  notes  any  awareness  of  financial  issues,  although  her
sister presumably knows. Applicant completed the credit counseling by her bankruptcy
petition (Tr. 74), but credits her past financial struggles for teaching her the importance
of keeping her finances straight. She filed for bankruptcy protection so she could start
with a clean slate.
3An account history in AE F suggests Applicant had significant delinquent bills as of November 2018, with
Applicant making periodic  catch-up payments, only to again fall behind with her payments. The $168.17
payment was a delinquent bill from an earlier month. No doubt, Applicant keeps payments to this creditor more
or less current so that her utility service will not be disconnected.
