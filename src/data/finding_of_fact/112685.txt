Under Guideline F, the Government alleged Applicant owed $24,631.38 for three
delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a – 1.c). SOR 1.a and 1.b allege debts for unpaid
income  taxes  totaling  $7,121.38  for  the  2013  and  2014  tax  years.  SOR  1.c  alleges  a
delinquent credit card account for $17,510. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted
each  allegation  and  provided  extensive  information  about  her  financial  circumstances
over  the past ten  years.  (Answer) In  addition  to  the facts thus established,  I  make the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 41 years old. She has completed post-high school vocational training
and, between 2006 and 2017, extensive DOD-sponsored acquisitions training. Applicant
has held a security clearance since 2006 for a series of jobs in the defense industry. (GX

Applicant  and  her  husband,  a  major  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  Reserve,  have  been
married since October 2009. Applicant was married twice previously. Her first marriage
ended in 2007, and she has one 19-year-old child from that marriage. Applicant and her
current husband have one child, age 8, together. Her husband also has two children -- an
11-year-old son and another now-adult child who was still a minor when they married --
from before his marriage to Applicant. Currently, Applicant’s children live with her and her
husband,  who  also  shares  custody  of  his  11-year-old.  That  child  lived  with  them  until
about 2012. (Answer; GX 1 – 3)
Applicant and her husband each brought debt to their marriage. In addition, they
used the credit card addressed in SOR 1.c to pay for their wedding. For the most part,
they have each managed their personal finances separately and were able to pay down
existing debts, including the SOR 1.c credit card, while meeting their regular obligations.
Applicant avers that events around the time their child was born in August 2010 as the
beginning  of  their  recent  financial  problems.  The  child  was  born  a  month  early  after  a

difficult pregnancy. As a result, Applicant was unable to work for a few months and was
eligible for short-term disability benefits from her company; however, the paperwork for
those benefits was not properly processed, and Applicant was without any income during
her time away from work. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 19, 51 – 52, 54 – 56, 77 – 78)
Applicant’s husband was on active duty in the Air Force when they got married.
Because he was dissatisfied with his career path, he took advantage of an early-release
monetary  incentive  and  left  active  duty  in  2011.  He  then  affiliated  with  an  Air  Force
Reserve command that allowed him to work in his preferred technical field. Since 2011,
he has primarily earned his income through a series of temporary active duty orders of
between 90 and 180 days. Unfortunately, there were also times between orders when he
earned  no  income  for  two  to  four  months  on  average.  In  2012,  Applicant’s  husband
obtained  work  as  a  defense  contractor,  but  he  was  laid  off  in  2013  when  the  contract
ended.  After  several  months  of  unemployment,  Applicant’s  husband  found  work  as  a
civilian employee at a nearby Air Force base; however, he is again on full-time active duty
orders through 2022. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 23 – 25, 36 – 40)
Before and after her child was born in August 2010, Applicant experienced a series
of job-related and other unforeseen problems that impacted her income. Before the child
was born, Applicant and her husband had been living in State A but he was transferred
to State B, where they now live. Because Applicant’s pregnancy was complicated, and
because her older child was still in school in State A, she did not immediately accompany
him. This  resulted  in  added  expenses for  two  residences  on  top  of  the expenses  later
incurred for moving and for special care for Applicant’s child. As already discussed, she
lost income when her short-term disability benefits. After the couple settled in State B,
Applicant and her husband unexpectedly had to take over full-time care of his 11-year-
old child, who was beset by numerous emotional and psychological problems. In addition
to added expenses, care for that child often meant time away from work and lost income.
By 2012, Applicant had fallen behind on several credit card accounts, including the debt
at SOR 1.c. After Applicant’s husband found work, they had more money but his schedule
often meant he was not able to help with running their household. Additionally, Applicant’s
employer was not paying her the salary she thought they had agreed to when she was
hired  in  2010.  When  the  contract  she  supported  through  that  job  ended  in  2016,
Applicant’s next employment paid her about 20 percent less. Between being unable to
coordinate day-to-day management of the household finances because of her husband’s
unavailability, and a lack of expected income, several bills and other routine obligations
went unattended. (Answer; GX 1 – 3; Tr. 18 – 21, 51 – 56, 61 – 68, 77 – 80)
Applicant’s  tax  problems  began  in  2011.  When  her  husband  received  his  early
release from active duty, no taxes were withheld from the incentive bonus he received.
They were unable to pay the resulting $13,000 tax bill, but they established a repayment
plan in April 2012 through which they satisfied their tax debt in May 2018. For reasons
related to loss of income, Applicant and her husband also were unable to pay their 2013
and 2014 taxes on time. As of May 2018, as alleged in SOR 1.a and 1.b, they owed a
total of $7,121.38. Those tax bills were satisfied between August and September 2018
as  a  result  of  payments  made  starting  in  October  2016.  The  most  recent  credit  report
produced by the Government does not reflect any past-due tax obligations. (GX 2 – 5;
Answer; AX A; Tr. 22 – 23, 38 – 39, 57, 81 – 83)
Between  2012  and  2016,  Applicant  and  her  husband  struggled  to  meet  their
regular financial obligations in addition to a variety of unexpected events (two car wrecks,
failed appliances, and unplanned travel in connection with Applicant’s stepchild’s moves
to  and  from  his  mother’s  home  in  State  C).  Additionally,  since  2012,  when  Applicant’s
stepchild’s  mother  regained  custody,  Applicant’s  husband  has  been  paying  $600  each
month  in  child  support.  Additionally,  Applicant’s  husband  had  to  pay  additional  child
support for several years for his older child. Applicant’s efforts to resolve her debts were
slowed further when she and her husband separated in November 2016, thus incurring
additional  expenses  for  two  separate  residences  and  for  legal  fees  associated  with  a
contemplated divorce. The couple reconciled in April 2018. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 18
– 21, 33 – 35, 53 – 54, 78 – 80, 87 – 88)
The last time Applicant was able to make any payments or attempts to negotiate
a  resolution  of  the  debt  at  SOR  1.c  was  2013,  when  she  learned  the  debt  had  been
charged  off  as  a  business  loss.  Between  2013  and  2018,  Applicant  chose  instead  to
resolve other debts that were within her means to pay. In 2018, Applicant was able to
negotiate  a  repayment  agreement  with  the  SOR  1.c  creditor  and,  in  July  2018,  began
paying  $200  each  month  according  to  that  agreement.  After  resolving  her  tax  debts,
Applicant began paying as much as $400 more each month to accelerate resolution of
that debt. (Answer; GX 1 – 3; AX B; AX C; Tr. 30 – 31, 51, 57 – 61, 80 – 81)
Applicant’s  finances  are  currently  sound.  A  townhouse  they  owned  as  a  rental
property has been sold, thus freeing up extra funds and their income is again sufficient to
pay their debts and meet all of their routine obligations. Applicant and her husband have
not incurred any new unpaid debts. They have filed their taxes as required since 2014,
and they have ensured that sufficient taxes are being withheld from their pay so they will
avoid any unpayable tax bills in the future. The most recent credit report produced in this
case does not reflect any adverse financial information. (Answer; GX 5; Tr. 81 – 83)
Applicant presented extensive information regarding her job performance and her
overall character. A witness testified about Applicant’s significant generosity and about
Applicant’s  volunteer  activities  at  her  child’s  school  and  at  a  community  food  bank.
Applicant  has  a  superior  record  of  performance  and  enjoys  a  solid  reputation  for
professionalism throughout her career in the defense industry. Among the observations
of government and industrial coworkers and supervisors is that Applicant has a spotless
record of safeguarding sensitive information and is exceedingly reliable and trustworthy.
