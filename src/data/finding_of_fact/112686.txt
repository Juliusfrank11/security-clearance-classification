Applicant  admitted  some  of  the  allegations,  with  some  explanation,  and  denied
other allegations. The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review
of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 39 years old. He has worked for a federal contractor since February
2017. Between 2014 and 2017, he was engaged in non-government employment. From
2006  to  2014  he  was  employed  by  other  federal  contractors.  He  has  an  associate’s
degree and a bachelor’s degree. He has never married. He has two children.1
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  owed  17  delinquent  debts  totaling  approximately
$123,000.  These  debts  include  past  due,  charged  off,  and  collection  accounts
comprised  of  student  loans,  consumer  debt,  state  tax  liens,  and  child  support
obligations.  Credit  reports  from  May  2017  and  March  2018  support  the  delinquent
debts.2
Applicant  explained  that  his  debt  problems  were  caused  by  not  having  enough
money to pay all his obligations. Except for two of the student loan debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a
and  1.d),  Applicant  failed  to  provide  documentation  to  support  that  he  was  addressing
his debts through payment, dispute, or contact with the creditors. The status of his debts
is as follows:3
Student Loan Debt. The SOR lists five delinquent student loans. Two accounts are to
creditor  A  totaling  $57,764  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.d).  Three  accounts  are  to  creditor  B
totaling $21,970. Applicant’s SOR answer included an attachment showing his account
with creditor A. This account reflected that a loan consolidation occurred in May 2018,
but it failed to detail what loans were consolidated. It further documented that Applicant
paid  $58,069  in  April  2018  and  $143  in  May  2018  toward  his  balance  owed.  Through
October 2018, it showed Applicant had not made any additional payments and that his
current balance was $73,943. There was no information in the document concerning the
student loan debt to creditor B. These debts are partially resolved.4
1 Item 2.
2 Items 4-5.
3 Items 1, 3.
4 Items 1 (See attachment to Applicant’s answer); 4-5.
Tax  Liens.  The  SOR  listed  two  state  tax  liens  (¶¶  1.k  and  1.l)  in  the  total  amount  of
$3,611.  During  his  background  interview  with  an  investigator,  Applicant  claimed  these
liens were placed because he failed to file his state tax returns for 2013 and 2015, and
pay the resulting tax owed. He stated that his wages were garnished and this tax debt
was  paid  in  January  2018.  These  two  liens  did  not  appear  on  his  March  2018  credit
report. They are resolved.5
Child Support. The SOR listed a delinquent child-support debt in the amount of $7,075
(¶  1.o).  Applicant  disputed  that  he  was  behind  on  his  child  support  obligations.  He
maintained  that  he  consistently  has  paid  his  $200  weekly  required  amount.  In  his
answer, Applicant admitted this debt and stated, “Arrears are paid bi-weekly.” His March
2018 credit report does not list this debt. This debt is being resolved.6
As  stated  above,  Applicant  failed  to  provide  any  documentation  showing  what
action he has taken to resolve the remaining debts. While his March 2018 credit report
shows that he disputed some debts, it does not provide the rationale for those disputes
or  their  resolution.  He  did  not  provide  any  information  about  his  current  financial
situation  or  a  budget,  other  than  to  state  that  he  can  meet  all  his  current  obligations.
There is no documented evidence of financial counseling.7
