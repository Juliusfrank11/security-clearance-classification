Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR,  with  clarifications.  After  a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 52 years old and married. He earned an associate’s degree in 2002.
He has worked for his employer, a government contractor, since September 2004. He
served on active duty in the Army from 1984 to 2004. (Item 3.)
Applicant  is  indebted  to  seven  creditors  for  over  $40,000  in  delinquent  debt  as
listed in the SOR. His consumer debts are established by credit reports dated October
2017 and May 2018. He also failed to file his Federal income tax returns as required in
2015 and 2016. His debt total includes approximately $4,000 owed to the IRS for the 2014
and 2015 tax years.2 He also owes an unstated amount to the IRS for tax year 2016. His
debts and delinquent tax filings are as follows. (Item 5; Item 6.)
Applicant failed to pay his 2014 Federal income taxes. Applicant explained that he
was audited by the IRS for tax year 2013 and that he was working with a tax consultant
to correct the 2013 filing, prior to filing 2014. He filed his 2014 Federal tax return in August
2017. His 2014 IRS tax transcript, dated August 13, 2018, shows that at that time he owed
the IRS $2,213 for 2014. (Item 2.)
Applicant failed to file and pay his 2015 and 2016 Federal income taxes, as stated
in SOR ¶ 1.b. Additionally SOR ¶ 1.d alleged Applicant was indebted to the IRS for tax
year 2015 in the amount of $2,000. Applicant’s 2015 IRS tax transcript, dated August 13,
2018, reflected that his 2015 Federal return was filed August 10, 2017. He owed $2,762
for  2015  at  that  time.  Applicant  did  not  produce  a  tax  transcript  for  the  2016  tax  year.
These is no evidence that he filed his Federal tax return for the 2016 tax year. (Item 2.)
1 DoD Directive ¶ E3.1.7 requires responses to be submitted 30 days from receipt of the Government’s
FORM.  The  cover  letter  accompanying  the  case  assignment  indicated  Applicant  was  given  45  days  to
submit a reply. He did not submit anything within either allotted time period.
2 The SOR alleged that Applicant owed the IRS $6,000 for the 2014 tax year. However, a debt of $2,213 is
reflected on the 2014 tax transcript.
Applicant explained in his Answer that he pays the IRS $170 per month and will
do so “until all taxes are paid in full.” (Item 2.) The IRS also garnishes “any refunds due
[him]  when  [he]  file[s]  and  put  it  towards  overdue  taxes.”  (Item  2.)  He  provided  a
screenshot from his credit union account that documented one payment of $170 to the
IRS in August 2018. His 2016 Federal tax returns appear to remain outstanding. (Item 2.)
Applicant  is  indebted  on  a  judgment  filed  against  him  in  November  2016  in  the
amount of $5,969, as stated in SOR ¶ 1.e. Applicant explained, “My wife took out credit
cards in my name and I found out with a summons to court.” He claimed to have set up a
payment plan with this creditor to resolve the debt through monthly payments of $170. He
provided  a  screenshot  from  his credit  union  account  that  documented  one  payment  of
$170 and claimed it pertained to this debt. However, the creditor’s name is different on
the statement. Without more information, I am unable to find that Applicant is resolving
this debt. (Item 2; Item 7.)
Applicant  is  indebted  on  a  charged-off  credit  card  in  the  amount  of  $12,964,  as
stated in SOR ¶ 1.f. This debt became delinquent in 2016. Applicant attributed this debt
to his wife taking out another credit card in his name, unbeknownst to him. He claimed to
have set up payment arrangements with this creditor to resolve the debt through monthly
payments  of  $150.  He  provided  a  screenshot  from  his  credit  union  account  that
documented one payment of $150 to a creditor of a different name. The evidence does
not  establish  that  this  payment  necessarily  pertained  to  this  debt.  This  debt  remains
unresolved. (Item 2; Item 5; Item 6.)
Applicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $7,182, as stated in
SOR ¶ 1.g. This debt became delinquent in 2016. This was another credit card account
opened without Applicant’s knowledge by his wife. Applicant indicated he intended to set
up payments to resolve this debt, but produced nothing further in that regard. This debt
is unresolved. (Item 2; Item 6.)
Applicant is indebted on a past-due account in the amount of $365, as stated in
SOR  ¶  1.h.  This  debt  became  delinquent  in  2018.  Applicant  indicated  that  this  debt  is
being garnished from his military retirement check. This debt is unresolved. (Item 2; Item
6.)
Applicant is indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $5,930, as stated
in SOR ¶ 1.i. This debt became delinquent in 2015. This was another credit card account
opened without Applicant’s knowledge by his wife. Applicant indicated he intended to set
up payments to resolve this debt, but produced nothing further in that regard. This debt
is unresolved. (Item 2; Item 6.)
Applicant is indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $3,929, as stated
in SOR ¶ 1.j. This debt became delinquent in 2016. This was another credit card account
opened without Applicant’s knowledge by his wife. Applicant indicated he intended to set
up payments to resolve this debt, but produced nothing further in that regard. This debt
is unresolved. (Item 2; Item 6.)
Applicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $542, as stated in
SOR ¶ 1.k. This debt became delinquent in 2015. This was another credit card account
opened without Applicant’s knowledge by his wife. Applicant indicated he intended to set
up payments to resolve this debt, but produced nothing further in that regard. This debt
is unresolved. (Item 2; Item 6.)
Applicant’s  checking  account  screenshot  dated  August  13,  2018,  reflected  a
balance of $3.06. He appears to have few funds available to address his delinquencies
or maintain solvency. (Item 2.)
