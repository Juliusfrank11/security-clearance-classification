Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since May 2016. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from
1998  until  he  was  honorably  discharged  in  2015.  He  seeks  to  retain  a  security
clearance,  which  is  a  requirement  for  his  job.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree,  which  he
earned  in  2018.  He  has  never  married,  but  he  had  a  cohabitant  at  one  time.  He  has
three children. (Tr. at 34, 36-40, 72, 78; GE 1)
Applicant has a history of financial problems before and after he was discharged
from the military. He helped his father financially in the 2000s by financing cars for his
father,  and  then  his  father  did  not  maintain  the  car  payments.  Applicant  was
unemployed  for  about  four  to  five  months  after  his  discharge.  He  filed  Chapter  13
bankruptcy petitions in 2004, 2007, January 2014, October 2014, and March 2015. All
of the cases were dismissed because of Applicant’s failure to take some action, such as
filing a plan, filing schedules, appearing at a meeting of creditors, or making payments.

Applicant lived with a cohabitant in the house that he owned. They were to share
the mortgage loan payments, with each to pay the loan in alternate months. She did not
maintain  her  payments,  and  then  they  ended  their  relationship,  which  eliminated  one
income  from  the  household.  The  Chapter  13  bankruptcies  in  2014  and  2015  were  to
keep  the  home  out  of  foreclosure.  The  home  was  ultimately  lost  to  foreclosure,  two
vehicles  were  repossessed,  and  other debts  went  unpaid.  (Tr. at 24-25, 41-56,  61-68;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 6-10)
The SOR alleges the five dismissed bankruptcy cases; the foreclosure mortgage
loan;  the  deficiencies  owed  on  the  auto  loans  after  the  vehicles  were  repossessed;
$15,499 owed to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) for the unearned
portion  of  a  reenlistment  bonus;  and  four  miscellaneous  delinquent  debts  totaling
$6,400.  Except  as  addressed  below,  the  allegations  are  established  through  credit
reports and Applicant’s admissions.
Applicant  lost  his  home  to  foreclosure  in  2016.  There  is  no  evidence  of  any
deficiency. The debt is listed with a $0 balance by all three credit reporting agencies on
the January 2017 combined credit report. The two subsequent Equifax credit reports do
not  list  the  debt.  Additionally,  Applicant  recently  bought  a  house  financed  with  a
mortgage  loan  through  the  bank  that  financed  the  house  that  was  lost  to  foreclosure.

Applicant  was  paid  a  reenlistment  bonus  while  in  the  military.  When  he  was
discharged  from  the  military,  DFAS  wanted  $15,450,  which  is  the  unearned  portion  of
his  reenlistment  bonus,  to  be  repaid.  The  debt  was  repaid  through  withholding  of
Applicant’s  income  tax  refunds.  The  debt  is  listed  by  Equifax  and  TransUnion  on  the
January  2017  combined  credit  report,  and  it  is  listed  on  the  May  2018  Equifax  credit
report. It is not listed on the March 2019 Equifax credit report. (Tr. at 26-27, 39, 70-72;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 6-10; AE M)
Applicant defaulted on a car loan. The January 2017 credit report lists the loan as
$5,008 past due with a $40,250 high credit and charged-off balance. That is the amount
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g. However, the May 2018 Equifax credit report lists the charged-off
balance as $6,692, which presumably is the deficiency balance after the car was sold.
Applicant  contacted  the  creditor  to  obtain  information  about  the  debt,  but  he  never
received anything from the company. The debt is not listed on the March 2019 Equifax
credit report. (Tr. at 23-24; GE 6-9; AE K)
Applicant made his final settlement payment on the $2,372 debt alleged in SOR
¶ 1.i in June 2018. He made his final payment on the $550 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j in
September 2017. In July 2019, he paid in full the $3,860 deficiency balance owed on a
car loan (SOR ¶ 1.l) after the car was repossessed. (Tr. at 29-31; GE 6-10; AE B, C, L)
Applicant denied owing the $206 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k. He asserted that he
paid the debt several years ago. He contacted the creditor, but they had no listing of his
name or Social Security number. The debt is listed by TransUnion on the January 2017
combined credit report. It is not listed on the 2018 and 2019 Equifax credit reports. (Tr.
at 30, 68; GE 6-9; AE K)
Applicant paid $1,197 in May 2018 to resolve a debt in collection. He stated that
it was for the $3,269 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.m. That debt is listed by Experian on the
January  2017  combined  credit  report.  It  is  not  listed  on  the  2018  and  2019  Equifax
credit  reports.  The  creditor  that  received  the  $1,197  payment  does  not  appear  on  any
credit report. The account numbers for the two creditors are not the same. There is no
documentary evidence that the two debts are the same. If they are not the same debt,
he paid a debt that was not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. at 31-33, 69; GE 6-10: AE I, J)
Applicant  stated  that  his  finances  are  in  better  shape,  and  that  he  is  smarter
about  credit  and  managing  his  finances.  He  worked  in  Iraq  and  Kuwait  for  about  19
months,  which  helped  him  get  back  on  his  feet  financially.  He  knows  that  financial
stability  is  required  for  him  to  maintain  his  security  clearance  and  job,  which  enables
him to support his children. The March 2019 credit report lists only one delinquent debt,
the  $3,860  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.l,  which  is  now  paid.  The  only  balances  on  the
report are $687 and $194 for two credit cards, which are current. (Tr. at 33, 73-74, 79;
GE 6-10)
