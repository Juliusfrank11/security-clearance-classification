Under  Guideline  F,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant  did  not  file  his  federal
income tax returns or pay his federal income taxes for the 2013 through 2017 tax years
(SOR 1.a); that he did not file his state income tax returns or pay his state income taxes
for the  2013  through 2017  tax  years (SOR 1.b); and  that  he owed  the  IRS  $18,461  in
unpaid  federal  income  taxes  (SOR  1.c).  It  was  further  alleged  that  Applicant  filed  a
Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in November 2010 that was dismissed before completion
in  October  2012  (SOR  1.d); and  that  he  owed  five  other  delinquent  or  past-due  debts
totaling $10,237 (SOR 1.e – 1.i).
In response, Applicant admitted the allegations at SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e; he
denied  the  remaining  allegations.  (Answer)  Additionally,  at  the  hearing,  Department
Counsel acknowledged that the debt at SOR 1.h was a duplicate of SOR 1.g and withdrew
the allegation at SOR 1.h. Accordingly, the total debt at issue in this case is $27,971. (Tr.
43 – 44, 52, 62 – 63)
In addition to the facts established by Applicant’s admissions, I make the following
additional findings of fact. Applicant is 53 years old and has been employed by a defense
contractor in State A since March 2017. Between September 2016 and March 2017, he
worked for a different defense contractor in State B, where he had lived since at least
May 1990. Applicant and his wife have been married since September 1988 and have
one adult child together. This is Applicant’s first application for a security clearance. (GX
1; Tr. 6)
As alleged in SOR 1.d, Applicant and his wife filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. They
did  so  to  address  their  outstanding  debts  and  to  save  their  home  in  State  B  from
foreclosure. Applicant had fallen behind on his mortgage, in part, due to mounting medical
bills and an income reduction when he changed jobs in 2010 to avoid a lay off. As to the
mortgage, it was a 15-year note that Applicant tried unsuccessfully to have modified to a
30-year  obligation  for  the  lower  monthly  payments  that  would  result.  After  almost  two
years  of  paying  off  debts  through  the  bankruptcy  trustee,  Applicant’s  only  remaining
delinquent debt was the mortgage. Absent a mortgage modification, Applicant decided,
on  advice  of  his  bankruptcy  attorney,  to  withdraw  his  bankruptcy  petition  and  let  the
mortgage go to foreclosure. The bankruptcy was voluntarily dismissed in October 2012.
Applicant has no remaining obligation from that mortgage because the house was sold at
auction for more than the remaining balance on the loan. Thereafter, Applicant and his
wife remained in State B until March 2017, when they moved to State A so he could take
his current defense contractor position. (Answer; GX 2; GX 5; Tr. 53 – 55)
Applicant’s  bankruptcy  petition  showed  that  Applicant  and  his  wife’s  assets
exceeded their liabilities by $10,318. They also declared in their petition that they had a
monthly net cash flow of $944. (GX 5)
In 2013, Applicant suffered an injury at  work that resulted in over six months of
unemployment  before  and  after  surgery  for  a  total  hip  replacement.  In  April  2014,
Applicant  did  not  file  his  federal or  state  income  tax  returns  for  the  2013  tax  year.  He
mistakenly believed that he did not have to file if he knew he would receive a refund, and
he claims he did not file because he was overwhelmed with his health issues. Thereafter,
Applicant did not file any of his federal or state income tax returns because he knew he
was  behind  and  he  did  not  know  what  to  do  about  his  situation.  Further  complicating
matters, he and his wife separated for about 18 months after his hip surgery. In 2016,
after  they  reconciled,  Applicant’s  wife  was  diagnosed  with  cancer.  Applicant  has  had
medical insurance at all times that has covered at least 80 percent of his hip surgery and
his wife’s cancer treatment. Applicant is usually responsible for the remaining 20 percent
of the costs. Those medical bills have strained his finances, and as a result, he incurred
the debts alleged at SOR 1.e – 1.g, and 1.i. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 29 – 31, 37)
The  $7,673  debt  at  SOR  1.e  is  the  remainder  after  resale  of  a  car  that  was
repossessed from Applicant in March 2017. Applicant had purchased the car in 2002 for
about $17,000, but in 2016 started missing his monthly payments. He has been in contact
with  the  creditor  collecting  this  debt,  but  Applicant  has  not  yet  made  any  documented
payments on this debt. (Answer; GX 2 – 4; Tr. 40 – 42)
The  unpaid  cable  television  and  internet  bill  for  $990  at  SOR  1.f  arose  when
Applicant  moved  from  State  B  to  State  A  in  2017  and  did  not  return  the  provider’s
equipment. Just before his hearing, he received boxes and labels with which to mail the
equipment to the creditor but had not yet resolved this matter. (Answer; GX 2 – 4; Tr. 42
– 43)
While he admitted he owes a debt for an unpaid cell phone bill as alleged at SOR
1.g arose, Applicant disputes the $727 balance due listed in the SOR. This debt remains
unpaid and Applicant is still trying to communicate with the creditor to resolve his dispute.
(Answer; GX 2 – 4; Tr. 43 – 44)
According to Applicant’s bankruptcy petition, he owes the IRS $18,461 for unpaid
income  taxes.  Applicant  avers he owes  only  about  $3,000, but  he did  not present any
information to support his claim. Applicant declared in his e-QIP that he had not filed his
income tax returns, as alleged in SOR 1.a and 1.b, since 2013. During a subject interview
with a government investigator on February 7, 2018, Applicant discussed his unfiled taxes
and  indicated  he  would  hire  an  accountant  to  help  him  resolve  the  matter.  On  July  3,
2018,  Applicant  answered  interrogatories  from  DOHA  Department  Counsel  about  his
unfiled taxes, indicating he was trying to get help in bringing his taxes up to date and to
resolve his other debts. In his February 4, 2019, response to the SOR, Applicant stated
that he had contacted the IRS to get his returns filed and that he was seeking help to file
his state  returns.  At  his  hearing,  Applicant  testified he  had  contacted an  accountant  in
State A and had a pending appointment to begin the process of filing all of his past-due
tax returns. As of the hearing, Applicant had also not yet filed his 2018 return because
the accountant advised he would be filing all of his past-due tax returns at the same time.
(Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 5; Tr. 31 – 36, 59 – 64)
The  IRS  documents  Applicant  provided  post-hearing  as  AX  C  –  H  are  his W-2
Wage and Tax Statements for the tax years 2013 through 2018. They do not establish
that he has filed any of the federal or state income tax returns addressed in SOR 1.a and
1.b, or that he has addressed the tax debt alleged in SOR 1.c. The debt calculator he
provided as AX A is from an IRS web page and shows that he also owes at least $2,668
in unpaid taxes for the 2007 tax year. Applicant has also averred that his efforts to resolve
his IRS debts have been hampered by inaccurate personal information contained in his
Social Security Administration (SSA) records. A week after his hearing, he went to a local
SSA  office  to  correct  that  information.  As  of  the  close  of  this  record,  Applicant  was
awaiting a new Social Security card. (Answer; GX 2; AX I; Tr. 32 – 33)
Applicant and his wife have sufficient monthly net income to meet all of their current
expenses. He testified that after moving to State A, his cost of living is greatly reduced.
Applicant’s wife has or is recovering from cancer, but she is unable to work and receives
monthly disability payments. After all of their expenses, they have about $500 remaining
each month; however, they sometimes incur large medical co-payments associated with
ongoing  monitoring  of  his  wife’s  cancer  recovery.  Applicant  and  his  wife  manage  their
finances together through a monthly budget. After the hearing, Applicant also presented
a  letter  of  recommendation  from  the  government  division  chief  of  the  organization
Applicant supports in his work. The author has known Applicant for the past six years and
speaks highly of Applicant’s diligence, professionalism, and trustworthiness. (AX A; Tr.
37, 44 – 49)
