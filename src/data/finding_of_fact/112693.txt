In his  Answer,  Applicant admitted the  sole allegation  contained  in  the SOR and
provided an explanation for the debt. (Answer)
Applicant is 43 years old and divorced since 2004. He and his former wife have
two children, ages 20 and 16. He has joint custody and provides financial support for the
children. He attended college between 1996 and 1997. He enlisted in the Army in June
1997 and served until he was honorably discharged in June 2000, as an E-4. He held a
security  clearance  while  serving. While  serving,  he  was  awarded  soldier  of  the month.
(Tr. 16-17; GE 1, GE 5; AE B)
In March 2017, Applicant submitted an electronic Questionnaires for Investigations
Processing  (e-QIP).  He  listed  full  employment  from  January  2001  until  April  2016.  He
disclosed that he failed to file or pay Federal and state tax returns for tax year 2009. He
estimated that he owed about $13,000. He stated that he had an installment agreement
with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to pay the debt while he was employed. However,
after  being  laid  off  in  April  2016,  he  was  unable  to  make  the  payments.  He  further
disclosed that he was filing an Unable to Pay Status form with the IRS. He stated that he
had joined a credit repair service to improve his credit score. (GE 1)
In  February  2018,  a  government  investigator  interviewed  Applicant  about  the
background information he provided in his e-QIP. During the interview, the investigator
informed  Applicant  that  the  IRS  had  filed  a  $17,003  lien  against  him  in  May  2012.2
Applicant agreed, and said that the tax debt was the same debt he disclosed in his e-QIP.
Applicant  stated  that  the  debt’s  balance  was  $13,000  because  he  had  been  making
monthly payments of $500, until he lost his job in April 2016. (GE 5) He did not provide a
document confirming that balance.
1Per my request, Applicant agreed to submit the following information: the initial amount of the IRS tax lien
filed in May 2012; the tax years included in that lien; and the current balance owed on that tax lien. (Tr. 33,
40)
2Applicant testified that this lien may have been over $20,000 at some point. (Tr. 32)
Applicant worked full-time from January 2001 to April 2016, at which time he was
laid off. (GE 1) He was then unemployed until about August 2017 when he took a position
as  a  truck  driver.  He  worked  for  two  months  and  left  in  October  2017  to  find  a  better
paying position. He remained unemployed until he started a position in February 2019.
(Tr. 24; GE 5)
Applicant  stated  his  tax  problem  began  after  he  and  his  wife  divorced  in  2004,
which created some tax confusion. In 2009, he hired a tax consultant to prepare his tax
returns for years 2006 through 2009. After retrieving his returns from the consultant, he
did not review the prepared returns or other documents, and instead mailed the sealed
envelope directly to the IRS. The IRS audited him and filed a lien against him in May 2012
for about $17,000. That lien remains unpaid and represents monies owed for those years
three years and possibly more. (Tr. 19-24)
Applicant admitted that he failed to timely file his Federal 2010 and 2011 income
tax returns, and he may owe taxes for those years as part of the 2012 lien. (Tr. 19-24) He
said he timely filed his 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 Federal taxes. (Tr. 28)
Applicant testified he filed his Federal income tax returns for 2016, 2017, and 2018,
on February 27, 2019, the day before his hearing. 3  (Tr.23, 28). He believes he will receive
a tax refund of about $7,285 for 2016 and 2017. He said that refund will be applied to the
outstanding  IRS  lien.  (Tr.  30-31)  He  stated  that  he  did  not  file  those  returns  sooner
because  he  was  unable  to  prepare  them  himself  and  he  could  not  afford  to  hire  a  tax
consultant or pay any outstanding taxes. (Tr. 29)
Applicant stated he initially entered into a payment plan with the IRS to resolve the
2012 lien either in 2012 or 2013 and began making monthly payments of about $560. He
said he made those payments until he was laid off in April 2016. (Tr. 26) His tax exhibits
do not confirm that he consistently made payments over those years. There is evidence
that he made monthly installment payments as follows: $100 in September, October, and
December 2010; $100 in January, March, and April 20114; $376 in March, April, and June
2013; $386 in July through December 2014; $386 from January through October 2015;
and $386 in January, February, and March 2016. (AE C through G)
Applicant thinks he initially owed the IRS about $20,000. (Tr. 32-33) He said he
filed all of his state income returns. He does not believe that he owes the state unpaid
taxes because he has not received communication from it regarding the matter. (Tr. 35-
36)
3The SOR did not allege security concerns related to the late filing of Applicant’s Federal tax returns for
2010,  2011,  2016,  and  2017.  Those  derogatory  facts  will  not  be  considered  in  analyzing  pertinent
disqualifying  conditions.  They  may  be  considered  in  assessing  Applicant’s  credibility,  and  analyzing
mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept.
4There  is  no  information  in  this  record  pertinent  to  any  installment  agreement  on  which  Applicant  was
making payments in 2010 and 2011, prior to the filing of the 2012 lien.
Applicant  submitted  a  budget  based  on  his  new  job.  His  annual  salary  is  about
$72,592. His net monthly pay is $3,600 and expenses are $2,435. He established another
payment plan with the IRS in March 2018 to address the outstanding lien. It is scheduled
to start on May 5, 2019, and requires a $346 monthly payment. Applicant included the
payment in his monthly expenses. (Tr. 29; AE B, AE I)
