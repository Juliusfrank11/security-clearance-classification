Applicant  admitted  the  three  allegations  contained  in  the  SOR.  He  provided
documents related to the allegations with his Answer.
Applicant is 58 years old and married to his wife for 30 years. He has three adult
children. He has been working in the field of welding since he was 20 years old. He began
his current position, as a welder, with a defense contractor two years ago. Prior to this
job, he worked for private companies. (Tr. 18-21)
In May 2017, Applicant submitted an electronic Questionnaires for Investigations
Processing (e-QIP). In it, he disclosed that he failed to file Federal and state tax returns
for  tax  year  2015.  He  also  disclosed  that  he  owed  the  Social  Security  Administration
(SSA)  $33,575  for  overpayments  he  received  for  disability  benefits.  (GE  1)  During  an
October 2018 interview with a government investigator, Applicant volunteered that he had
not filed tax returns for 2007, 2008, 2009, and a couple other years. He stated that he
had received social security disability (SSI) benefits for a couple years following hernia
surgery, and owed the SSA about $33,000 in overpayments. He said he was repaying
the debt with monthly payments of $10. (GE 5)
Applicant testified that his tax filing problems began with tax year 2007. He did not
timely file those returns because he did not think he would have enough money to pay
his taxes, and then he began procrastinating year after year. At some point, he thought
he may be dead before he needed to pay his taxes because he had begun to use heroin.
He continued to use heroin into 2010 when he sought treatment and stopped using the
illegal substance. He also had cardiac surgery around the same time. (Tr. 22-23, 26) He
admitted that his tax problems eventually “spiraled out of control.” (Tr. 24)
Applicant began collecting disability after his 2010 surgery. He received payments
during 2011, 2012, and 2013, during which time he was also working. He thought he could
earn  more  money  than  the  regulations  permitted  while  on  disability.  Subsequently,  he
received notice that he owed the SSA over $33,000. He said he established a monthly
repayment  plan of  $50  in  2016. That amount  was  reduced to  $10  a  month in  October
2018 after he was laid off from a position. As of October 2018, the balance was $33,395,
and his monthly payments were listed as $10. (Tr. 27-31; Answer)
Applicant admitted that he did not timely file Federal and state income tax returns
for the following years: 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2016. (Tr. 34, 39, 41,
44-49) All of those returns were filed between October and November 2018.1 (Tr. 39, 50,
54) He has not filed Federal or state income tax returns for 2009 due to some confusion
with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which filed a return for him and assessed unpaid
taxes for 2009. (Tr. 44, 50) He timely filed tax returns for 2006, 2012, 2014, and 2017.
(Tr. 45, 47, 50)
Applicant  owes  the  IRS  about  $13,000  for  unpaid  taxes  for  years:  2007,  2008,
2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2016. He does not know how much he owes for 2017. 2  (Tr.
50-51) He recently requested a payment plan with the IRS. He offered to make monthly
payments of $100 to the IRS. He has not received a response. (Tr. 51)
Applicant  owes  his  state  department  of  revenue  about  $475  for  unpaid  income
taxes for the above-alleged years. He has not contacted the state to establish a payment
plan, but is waiting to hear from it. (Tr. 52-54)
