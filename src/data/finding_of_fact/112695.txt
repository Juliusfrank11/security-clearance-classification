Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  -  1.k,  with  a  brief  narrative  statement.  I  have
incorporated his admissions into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 32 years old. He married in 2010. He and his wife separated in 2014,
though they remain legally married. They have no children. Applicant graduated from high
school in 2005. He took online courses from 2011 to 2014, but did not obtain a degree.
He has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since February 2017. He
held his previous job from 2010 to January 2017. (Item 1)
Applicant  disclosed  on  his  October  2017  SCA  that  he  had  $62,000  in  past-due
federal student loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.j), and an $805 overdue local tax debt from 2016.
(SOR ¶ 1.k). He said his debts were due to low income. (Item 3)
Applicant noted in his Answer that his tax debt had increased to $1,200. He made
a $400 payment in August 2018, and intends to continue making payments to resolve the
debt. (Answer; FORM Response; AE C; AE D)
Applicant’s  ten  delinquent  federal  student  loans  are  alleged  as  SOR  ¶¶  1.a
($8,049), 1.b ($4,842), 1.c ($7,793), 1.d ($7,680), 1.e ($8,383), 1.f ($4,739), 1.g ($5,869),
1.h  ($4,796),  1.i  ($3,636)  and  1.j  ($6,746).  They  are  listed  on  his  October  2017  credit
report,  and  total  $62,533.  This  is  comparable  to  what  Applicant  disclosed  on  his  SCA
($62,081). The credit reports reflect that Applicant received the loans between 2011 and
2014, when he was taking online courses. He reported on his SCA that the student loans
had been delinquent since 2013. (Items 1, 3, 4)
2 In his FORM Response, Applicant “objected” to certain statements made by Department Counsel in the
FORM. I do not construe those comments as formal objections to admission of the Government’s evidence.
3  AE  A  is  a  July  2018  statement  from  Applicant’s  student  loan  provider.  AE  B  reflects  his  student  loan
payments as of September 2018. AE C and AE D concern payments on a local tax debt. AE E is Applicant’s
student loan rehabilitation agreement, signed August 31, 2018. AE F and AE G are statements from his
student loan provider, from August and September 2018.
The principal on Applicant’s federal student loans is $58,364. (AE A, AE F, AE G)
As of July 2018, he owed an additional $6,376 in interest and penalties, plus $15,757 in
fees and costs, for a total balance of about $80,500. (AE A)
On July 31, 2018, the day after he answered the SOR, Applicant entered into a
loan rehabilitation agreement with his loan provider. The agreement noted that his federal
student  loans  were  in  default.  He  was  to  make  nine  monthly  payments  of  $5.00  each
month to rehabilitate his loans and bring them out of delinquent status. (Answer; AE E)
His loans remained delinquent, with increased balances, as of September 2018. (Item 5;
AE F; AE G)
Applicant made a $105 payment on May 1, 2018. He made a $53 payment on July
17, 2018. He made a $5.00 payment on August 16, 2018, and another $5.00 payment on
September 18, 2018. All of Applicant’s payments were applied to interest and fees, and
not to the principal on the loan. (AE B)
Applicant’s  most  recent  statement  from  his  student  loan  provider  is  dated
September 11, 2018 (between the two $5.00 payments). As of that date, the amount he
owed  in  interest had  increased  to  about  $6,829,  and  the  amount he owed  in fees and
costs had increased to $15,868. Thus, Applicant’s total loan balance owed had increased
to $81,061. (AE G)
Applicant noted in his FORM Response that he now earns $13.05 an hour. This is
a $4.05 increase from his prior hourly rate. (FORM Response).
