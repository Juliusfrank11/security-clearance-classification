Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations but ¶ 2.a, which he denied. He is 51
years old. He married in 2001, separated in 2017, and his divorce was pending as of the
date of the hearing. He has three minor children. (Tr. at 43-44, 68, 74, 77, 80; GE 1, 2;
AE JJ, LL, B, O).
Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in 1997 and a master’s degree in 2004. He
served honorably in the U.S. military from 1988 until 2018. He was a retired officer from
the Reserve as of March 2018. He has worked as a solo independent contractor for a
DOD  contractor  since  March  2019.  He  was  first  granted  a  security  clearance  in  1989.
(Tr. at 9-10, 47-50, 61-62, 64-65, 82-83, 94-95; GE 1, 2; AE GG, JJ, KK, B, C, D, E, F,
G, H).
The SOR alleges that Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in July 2016 (SOR ¶
1.a). It alleges that he was delinquently indebted to the U.S. Government for $345,660
for tax years 2010 through 2014 and $72,657 in business trust fund taxes (SOR ¶¶ 1.b,
1.g). It alleges that he was delinquently indebted to a county tax authority in state C for
$11,098 in real estate taxes and $1,356 in unpaid taxes, and to the state C tax authority
for  $2,638  in  unpaid  taxes  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  1.i,  1.j).  It  alleges  that  he  was  delinquently
indebted to the state A tax authority for $6,301 in employee withholding tax, an unpaid
tax assessment of $5,847, and $4,263 in unpaid taxes (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.h 1.k). It alleges
that  he  was  delinquently  indebted  to  the  state  B  tax  authority  for  an  unpaid  tax
assessment  of  $5,398,  $472  in  state  unemployment  taxes,  and  a  $27,258  judgment
(SOR  ¶¶  1.e,  1.f,  1.l).  The  SOR  also  alleges  that  he  falsified  his  September  2017
security  clearance  application  (SCA)  by  responding  “No”  to  section  26,  which  inquired
whether he had failed to file or pay required federal, state, or other taxes within seven
years of completing his SCA (SOR ¶ 2.a).
Applicant and his wife previously owned an independent contracting  business in
state  C,  where  they  live,  from  approximately  2006  to  2016.  During  this  period,  his
estimated annual salary was $80,000; he was unaware how much his wife earned. He
testified that it was his wife’s responsibility to work with their certified public accountants
(CPAs) and tax attorneys in managing all of their finances, to include their taxes, as he
worked 40 to 50 hours weekly primarily in states A and B. He cites to her failure to do so
responsibly  that  led  to  his  bankruptcy  and  delinquent  taxes.  He  testified  that  she  also
spent money irresponsibly, to include charging upwards of $30,000 on their credit cards,
haphazardly spending a $300,000 business loan, and misspending money he had given
her for their mortgage. He testified that though their home and business address were
the same, he did not see mail concerning their delinquent taxes or understand the depth
of  their  financial  problems  until  late  2015,  approximately  six  months  before  they  filed
bankruptcy. He also cites to bad advice from tax attorneys and CPAs as a reason for his
financial issues. Between 2013 and 2017, he traveled for pleasure to the Bahamas four
times, and to Costa Rica, Mexico, and Canada. (Tr. at 43-103; GE 1, 2, 3; AE KK, LL,
L).
Applicant and his wife initially filed joint Chapter 13 bankruptcy in July 2016. He
severed  their  bankruptcy  case  in  December  2017  and  has  since  proceeded  as  an
individual debtor.  His delinquent federal,  county,  and  state  A  and C taxes  are  listed  in
his  bankruptcy  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.d,  1.g-1.k).  As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing  and  since
December  2017,  he  made  30  months  of  payments  at  $400  monthly  towards  his
bankruptcy and the bankruptcy court had not yet approved his plan. (Tr. at 43-103; GE
1, 2, 3, 4; AE BB, CC, FF, KK, LL, I, K, L, M, O, S).
Applicant acknowledged that his delinquent state B taxes, to include the state B
judgment of $27,258, remain unresolved. He hoped to resolve them through his divorce
and bankruptcy proceedings (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.l). He was unaware of the outstanding
liability, if any, for his state C taxes for tax years 2014 and 2015, which he expected to
file  promptly  after  the  hearing  date.  He  has  owned  his  home  since  2005.  He  testified
that  his  mortgage  became  delinquent  because  no  payments  were  made
for
approximately one year and a half. He testified that he was advised by his bankruptcy
and divorce attorneys not to make any mortgage payments for that duration because he
was attempting to switch the mortgage to solely his name without a quitclaim deed. He
testified that as of the date of the hearing, he was attempting to obtain a quitclaim deed
through the divorce process. He testified that he entered into a trial loan modification of
$2,000 monthly from February through April 2019; he made the payments for February
and March 2019; he did not foresee any issue with making the April 2019 payment; and
he hoped to be approved for a modified loan with the delinquent balance tacked onto it.
He testified that he did not have any other delinquent debts. (Tr. at 43-103; GE 1, 2, 3,
4; AE BB, KK, LL, K, M, O, S).
Applicant  testified  that  his  ongoing  divorce  is  a  contested  one,  primarily  due  to
the  allocation  of  debts  that  were  incurred  during  their  marriage.  He  received  financial
counseling  through  his  bankruptcy  in  February  2016.  He  testified  that  he  has  also
received financial counseling from his bankruptcy attorney and CPA. He testified that he
relies  on himself, his CPA, his bankruptcy  attorney, as  well  as  a  payroll  firm  whom  he
hired  in  late  December  2018,  to  keep  all  of  his  personal  and  business  finances
organized  and  current.  He  testified  that  he  filed  his  taxes  for  tax  year  2018.  He
acknowledged  that  he  should  have  taken  more  responsibility  with  his  finances  sooner
than  he  did.  He  signed  a  statement  of  intent  to  file  and  pay  his  required  federal  and
state taxes in the future. (Tr. at 43-103; AE DD, EE, HH, J, N, O).
Applicant  earns  $60,000  annually.  He  is  rated  30%  disabled  by  the  U.S.
Department  of  Veterans  Affairs,  for  which  he  receives  $500  monthly.  His  total  net
monthly  income  is  approximately  $4,020,  and  his  total  net  monthly  remainder  after
expenses  is  approximately  $300.  He  depleted  all  of  his  retirement  accounts  with  his
bankruptcy,  with  the  exception  of  approximately  $10,000  in  his  children’s  529  college
savings plans. He testified that he is loyal to the United States. (Tr. at 43-103; AE N, O,
T).
Appellant  testified  that  he  did  not  intend  to  deceive  by  failing  to  affirmatively
answer “Yes” to the portion of section 26 of his 2017 SCA that inquired whether he had
failed  to  file  or  pay  required  federal,  state,  or  other  taxes  within  seven  years  of
completing  his  SCA.  He  testified  that  evidence  of  his  lack  of  intent  to  deceive  is
demonstrated by his disclosure of his bankruptcy, in which he had listed his delinquent
taxes,  in  the  same  SCA.  Specifically,  he  listed  that  he  filed  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  in
July  2016,  with  a  total  amount  of  $230,000  involved  in  the  bankruptcy,  and  indicated
that  not  all  of  his  debts  were  discharged  and  some  had  to  be  repaid.  He  made  no
mention  of  his  delinquent  taxes  in  this  portion  of  his  response.  He  discussed  his
bankruptcy and delinquent taxes during his April 2018 background interview. (Tr. at 58-
60; GE 1, 2; AE KK, LL).
Applicant’s  bankruptcy  attorney  testified.  Applicant  hired  her  in  December  2018
to replace his previous bankruptcy attorney, who was conflicted from representing both
Applicant  and  Applicant’s  wife  due  to  their  ongoing  divorce  proceedings  and  the
continuing nature of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. She testified that Applicant’s bankruptcy
was pending as of the date of the hearing; she was scheduled to file an amended plan
within  approximately  30  days  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  after  having  facilitated  with
Applicant and his CPA the filing of his local taxes to state C for 2014 and 2015; and she
expected  that  Applicant’s  plan  would  then  be  up for approval by  the  bankruptcy  court.
She  testified  that  there  had  been  contested  issues  with  the  bankruptcy  because  there
are two debtors, Applicant and his wife, and they have to find a way to pay the required
tax  claims  that  is  agreeable  to  both  debtors,  their  respective  attorneys,  and  the  taxing
authorities. She testified that Applicant addressed the tax claims made by the IRS and
states  A  and  C  in  his  bankruptcy.  Though  he  did  not  address  any  tax  by  state  B
because no such claims had been filed by that state tax authority, she testified that she
intended to follow up with state B to determine why they were delinquent in not filing a
claim. She wrote:
[Applicant] is now well on his way to financial fidelity and back on track to
getting  his financial  house  in  order. .  .  .  I  am  confident  now  that  with  my
help  and  my  firms  help  he  will  no  longer  face  the  kind  of  financial
difficulties  that  his  ex-wife  left  him  to  handle  and  clean  up  over  the  last
three years.
(Tr. at 21-42, 58; AE II, A, L, M, N, Q, R, S).
Multiple  character  references  attested  to  Applicant’s  honesty,  integrity,  and
reliability.  He  received  the  Navy  Achievement  Medal,  Good  Conduct  Medal,  Navy
Reserve Meritorious Service Medal, and various unit awards. (Tr. at 21-42, 58; AE II, JJ,
A, B, F, P, Q, R, S).
