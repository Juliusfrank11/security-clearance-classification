In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 60-year-old linguist employed by a defense contractor since June
2017. He worked as a linguist for other defense contractors from July 2003 to July 2011.
He received a security clearance in November 2004.
Applicant  was  born  in  Lebanon.  He  enrolled  in  the  Lebanese  Army  Military
Academy in 1980 but resigned in 1981 when its pilot training program was discontinued.
He came to the United States in November 1982 on a student visa. He graduated from a
U.S.  university  in  June  1984  and  returned  to  Lebanon.2  He  married  a  U.S.  citizen  in
November 1985 and came to the United States on a marriage visa in September 1988.
He divorced in November 1988 but remained in the United States and became a U.S.
citizen in November 1991.
Applicant  returned  to  Lebanon  in  September  2003  and  married  a  citizen  and
resident  of  Lebanon.  He  returned  to  the  United  States  in  April  2009.  He  divorced  his
second wife in November 2015. He has two children from his second marriage, ages 13
and 10, for whom he pays child support of $530 per month. He calls his children about

three times a week to check on their well-being and school progress. (FORM Item 7 at
6.) His children are U.S. citizens and live with their mother, who is a lawyer in Lebanon.
Applicant returned to Lebanon in June 2011 to care for his ailing mother, a citizen
and resident of Lebanon. He was unemployed while in Lebanon. He returned to the United
States in December 2016 and was unemployed until February 2017. His mother passed
away in August 2018. His father passed away before he submitted his SCA.
Applicant  has  two  sisters,  ages  55  and  51,  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Lebanon. His sisters are married. The older sister owns a shoe store. The younger sister
is  a  housewife  who  is  not  employed  outside  the  home.  (FORM  Item  7  at  6.)  The
occupations  of  their  husbands  are  not  reflected  in  the  record.  During  Applicant’s
unemployment,  he  borrowed  about  $50,000  from  his  older  sister  for  living  expenses.
When his mother was alive, he talked to his sisters weekly because they cared for his
mother. The record does not reflect the frequency of his contact with his sisters now that
his mother has passed away.
At  the  request  of  Department  Counsel,  I  have  taken  administrative  notice  that
.
Lebanon  is  a  parliamentary  republic.  It  apportions  governmental  authority  among  a
Maronite  Christian  president,  a  Shia  speaker  of  the  parliaments,  and  a  Sunni  prime
minister. A president was elected in October 2016. Parliamentary elections in 2009 were
considered  by  observers  to  be  peaceful,  fair,  and  free  from  regional  influences,  but
subsequent elections have been postponed repeatedly since 2013.
I have taken notice that the U.S. Department of State discourages U.S. nationals
from  traveling  to  Lebanon  due  to  crime,  terrorism,  and  armed  conflict.  Kidnapping  for
ransom, political motives or as a result of family disputes is a serious problem. Several
terrorist  groups  operate  in  Lebanon  and  control  areas  in  the  Bekaa  Valley,  southern
Lebanon, and south Beirut. Palestinian refugee camps remain outside the jurisdiction of
local security forces and pose a security threat due to potential militant recruitment and
terrorist infiltration.
I  have  also  taken  administrative  notice  of  significant  human  rights  issues  in
Lebanon,  including  arbitrary  or  unlawful  killings  by  government  forces  and  non-state
actors and torture by security forces. I have taken notice of the Lebanese government’s
violation  of  citizens’  privacy  rights;  restrictions  of  freedom  of  speech,  press,  and
assembly;  lack  of  governmental  action  to  investigate  abuse  of  refugees;  and  limits  on
political participation through repeatedly postponed elections and official corruption.
The SOR alleges three delinquent debts reflected in credit reports from July 2017
(FORM  Item  4)  and  June  2018  (FORM  Item  5),  a  personal  debt  disclosed  during  the
background  investigation  (FORM  Item  4),  and  a  federal  income  tax  debt  disclosed  in
Applicant’s  SCA  (FORM  Item  3)  and  in  his  answer  to  the  SOR  (FORM  Item  4).  The
evidence concerning these debts is summarized below.
SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b: credit-card accounts charged off in May 2013 and June
2017 and placed for collection of $7,976 and $5,278. In Applicant’s answer to the SOR,
he attributed these debts to overspending by his second ex-wife. He stated that he has a
lawyer who is was negotiating with the creditors. He submitted no documentary evidence
of negotiations, payment agreements, payments, or other resolution of these debts.
SOR  ¶  2.c:  cellphone  bill  placed  for  collection  of  $57  in  July  2017.  In
Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  attributed  this  debt  to  miscommunication  with  the
provider  during  an  overseas  deployment.  He  stated  that  the  issue  is  resolved  and  he
continues  to  receive  service  from  the  same  provider.  He  provided  no  documentary
evidence of the status of this debt.
SOR ¶ 2.d: debts totaling $50,000 to sister, accumulated between 2011 and
2016. Applicant’s sister has not imposed a due date for repayment. Applicant asserts that
he will eventually repay it. (FORM Item 6 at 3.)
SOR ¶ 2.e: federal income tax debt for $39,000. When Applicant submitted his
SCA, he disclosed that he had failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for
2012  or  pay  the  taxes  due,  that  he  had  failed  to  file  his  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns for 2014, and that he failed to file his return or pay the federal income taxes due
for 2015. He estimated that he owed $15,000 for 2012, nothing for 2014, and $12,000 for
2015.  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  submitted  documentation  that  he  had  a  payment
agreement with the IRS in 2012 for monthly $250 payments, but he submitted no evidence
that he had made any payments. He attached tax notices to his answer, reflecting that he
owed  federal  income  taxes  of  $645  for  2008;  $8,814  for  2009;  $5,687  for  2010;  and
$5,913 for 2011. He attached a copy of a federal income tax return for 2017, prepared by
a professional tax preparer, reflecting that he was entitled to a refund of $6,019, but he
submitted no evidence showing that the return was filed. He stated that he had a lawyer
who was negotiating with the IRS, but he submitted no evidence of payment agreements,
payments, or other resolution of his tax debts.
Applicant  earned  about  $160,000  per  year  as  a  linguist  in  2007  through  2010.
(FORM  Item  7  at  8.)  He  submitted  no  evidence  of  his  current  income  and  expenses.
Although he stated that he was working with a lawyer and an accountant to resolve his
financial problems, he provided no evidence of financial counseling.
