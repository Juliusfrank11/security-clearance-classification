Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  of  the  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  60-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  page  7.)
He has been employed with the defense contractor since September of 2017. (GX 1 at
page 12.) He has held a security clearance since June of 2010. (GX 1 at page 57.) He
is married,  and has  thirteen  children,  seven of  whom  are  “adopted  .  .  .  grandchildren.’
(TR  at  page  11  line  12  to  page  15  line  21.)  Applicant  attributes  his  past-due
indebtedness  to  a  five  year  period  of  unemployment,  and  to  a  “slip  and  fall”  injury
sustained  at  a  grocery  store.  Applicant’s  current  salary  is  about  “$120,000,”  with
“$45,000” in a checking account. (TR at page 39 line 7 to page 40 line 3.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted a past-due medical bill in the
amount of about $65,000. At his hearing Applicant appears to take issue with this debt.
(TR  at  page  21  line  7  to  page  31  line  8,  and  at  page  33  lines  4~18.)  However,  this
alleged  past-due  debt  is  supported  the  Government’s  most  recent  July  2018  credit
report. (GX 5 at page 1.) Furthermore, in his Answer, his hospital medical bill shows that
his  “copay  deductible”  has  increased  to  $79,000.  (Answer  at  page  “52  of  213.”)  I  find
that  this  substantial  medical  debt  is  still  outstanding;  and  as  such,  this  allegation  is
found against Applicant.
1.b. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant also admitted a past-due medical bill in
the amount of about $871. At his hearing Applicant again appears to take issue with this
debt. (TR at page 37 lines 9~14.) However, this alleged past-due debt is supported the
Government’s  November  2017  credit  report.  (GX  4  at  page  8.)  I  find  that  this medical
debt is still outstanding; and as such, this allegation is found against Applicant.
1.c. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted a past-due medical bill in the
amount of about $328. At his hearing Applicant appears to take issue with this debt. (TR
at  page  37  lines  16~21.)  However,  this  alleged  past-due  debt  is  supported  the
Government’s  November  2017  credit  report.  (GX  4  at  page  8.)  I  find  that  this medical
debt is still outstanding; and as such, this allegation is found against Applicant.
1.d. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted a past-due medical bill in the
amount of about $184. This alleged past-due debt is also supported the Government’s
November  2017  credit  report.  (GX  4  at  page  8.)  I  find  that  this  medical  debt  is  still
outstanding; and as such, this allegation is found against Applicant.
