Applicant, age 55, has two adult children and one minor child. In December 2017,
because of his drinking habits, his wife separated from him after 29 years of marriage. A
divorce is pending. He received a high school diploma in 1981. He has been employed
as  a  product  line  manager  since  2005,  and  has  maintained  his  current  DOD  security
clearance since 1996. He previously held a DOD security clearance during his service in
the U.S. Air Force from 1981 through 1990. (Item 2; Item 4 at 7).
Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while impaired by alcohol (DWI)
in 1997, 2002, and 2017. He successfully completed alcohol treatment programs in 1996,
2003,  and  2018.  Each  time,  his  treatment  recommendations  advised  abstention  from
alcohol.  He  was  diagnosed  with  an alcohol use  disorder  during  treatment  in  2003  and
2018. The record does not establish whether a diagnosis was rendered during his 1996
treatment. (Item 1; Item 2 at 29-30, 33-34; Item 4 at 4, 5, 7, 8 11, 12; Item 5; Item 8).
During his 2015 and 2018 security clearance interviews, Applicant acknowledged
his alcoholism and referred to himself as an alcoholic. He recognized that he consumed
alcohol  to  relieve  stress  and  to  avoid  his  problems.  He  conceded  the  poor  judgment
associated  with  his alcohol  consumption.  However, in  his  2019 SOR  answer,  while  he
admitted the “bad decision” that he made driving after drinking, he believed that his 2017
arrest “would not have occurred” had it not been for his wife and daughter pressuring him
to conduct a safety test on a vehicle with an expired registration. (Item 1; Item 4 at 5 and
8).
Earlier in the day of his arrest in 2017, Applicant reportedly consumed “almost a
pint” of whiskey at his home. After dinner, believing “enough time had passed” and that
he was not impaired, he drove his daughter’s car to test whether its power steering issues
had resolved before she drove it to college the following day. An officer stopped him for
an  unspecified  reason  and  then  discovered  that  the  vehicle’s  registration  had  been
flagged for failing an emissions test. After failing field sobriety tests and registering a blood
alcohol  content of  .11,  Applicant  was  charged  with  several offenses,  including  DWI.  In
February 2018, he pled guilty to DWI for he received probation before judgment, including
six months in jail, suspended, and unsupervised probation for three years. (Item 4 at 7;
Item 5).
Applicant reported two periods of sobriety prior to his 2017 arrest: approximately
one year following his 1997 arrest, and approximately 10 years between 2004 and 2014.
He attributed resuming alcohol consumption in about 2014 to the stress associated with
ongoing  marital  issues.  He  had  been  in  counseling  due  to  his  marital  problems  in  the
months prior to his 2017 arrest, and had attended an AA meeting just days before. (Item
1; Item 4 at 8, 11 through 13).
Applicant  has  not  consumed  alcohol  since  his  2017  arrest  and  intends  to  stay
sober.  As  of  April  2018,  he  had  been  attending  AA  meetings  three  days  per  week.  In
March 2019, he affirmed his desire and motivation to stay sober, particularly since he had
reportedly suffered a myriad of negative personal and financial consequences after his
2017 arrest. Because he did not address it in his SOR answer or respond to the FORM,
the record does not specify his current relapse prevention or stress management plans,
including whether he continued his AA attendance after April 2018. (Item 1; Item 4 at 8
and 13).
