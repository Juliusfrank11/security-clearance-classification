Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 2.a, with clarifications. Applicant failed to admit
or deny the new allegation, SOR ¶ 1.b, in his Response. As a result, SOR ¶ 1.b will be
treated as a denial. The SOR alleged Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns
for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017. The SOR also alleged that Applicant failed to disclose
his delinquent tax filings when he completed his security clearance application in August
2016.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits,  I  make  the
following findings of fact:
Applicant is 39 years old. He is single and has no children. He has been employed
in government service either as a contractor or a civilian employee since 2002. He was
awarded the Meritorious Civilian Service Award in September 2014, for his work with the
U.S.  Navy.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance  since 2006,  without incident.  (Response;
Answer; Item 3.)
Applicant  has  been  diagnosed  with  Social  Anxiety  Disorder.  His  “presenting
problems include marked fear or anxiety about possible scrutiny by others, fear of being
rejected by others, and avoiding situations that might lead to those fears.” (Response.)
He has been receiving treatment for this condition weekly since August 2018. His board
certified  counselor  opined  that  Applicant  is  “making  the  necessary  changes  to  live  a
healthier lifestyle and is deeply committed to his treatment and living a life free of anxiety.”
She gave him a favorable prognosis. He voluntarily sought treatment for this condition,
and self-reported it to the government. (Response.)
Applicant  explained  that  prior  to  receiving  treatment  his  anxiety  caused  him  to
“withdraw or to become inactive during uncomfortable situations rather than dealing with
them  directly.”  As  a  result,  when  he  realized  he  forgot  to  timely  file  his  2015  Federal
income taxes, his anxiety condition caused him “to ignore [his] oversight rather than [to]
immediately  file  [his]  tax  returns.”  (Response.)  With  the  help  of  counseling,  he  has
developed tools to cope with his anxiety.
Applicant failed to timely file his 2015 and 2016 Federal income tax returns. He
documented that they were filed, along with his 2017 Federal income tax return on April
25, 2018. His 2017 Federal tax returns were filed seven days late, as that return was due
on April 17, 2018.1 Applicant received refunds for the 2015 through 2017 tax years. He is
now current on his required tax fillings, and promised to timely file his income tax returns
in  a  timely  manner  in  the  future.  His  new  toolset  for  managing  anxiety  will  aid  him  in
following that requirement. (Answer; Response; Item 4; Item 5.)
When Applicant completed his security clearance Application on August 16, 2016,
he answered “no” to question 26, which asked if he had failed to file or pay Federal, state,
or other taxes as required by law. However, when Applicant was asked this same question
during  his  subject  interview  on  January  19,  2018,  Applicant  answered,  “yes”  and
voluntarily disclosed that he had not filed his 2015 or 2016 Federal income tax returns.
He  explained  that  his  failure  to  list  his  delinquent  2015  tax  returns  on  his  security
clearance application was due to an oversight.2 (Response; Item 5.)
