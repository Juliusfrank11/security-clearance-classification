Applicant  is  a  58-year-old  electronics  technician  for  a  defense  contractor  who
seeks  a  security  clearance.  The  allegations  covered  in  the  SOR  and  admitted  by
Applicant  are  incorporated  and  adopted  as  relevant  and  material  findings.  Additional
findings follow.
Background
Applicant married his first spouse in September 1979, and divorced in June 1993.
(Item  2) He remarried in April 1997 and  divorced her in  June  1998.  He  has no  children
from  either  marriage.  Applicant  attended  college  classes  between  January  1985  and
September  1997  and  earned  an  associate’s  degree.  (Item  2)  He  reported  no  military
service.
Since  April  2016,  Applicant  has  worked  for  his  current  employer.  (Items  2-3)
Previously,  he  worked  for  other  employers  in  various  types  of  positions.  (Items  2-3)  He
reported unemployment between January 2014 and August 2015. (Items 2-3)
Applicant’s finances
Records confirm that Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns for tax
years  2000-2004,  2007,  and  2014.  (Items  3-6)  Reportedly,  he  accrued  aggregate
delinquent  taxes  exceeding  $44,000  for  these  years.  To  date,  he  has  not  provided  any
documentation of filing his federal returns or making payments on his owed federal taxes
for these years. In March 2013, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a federal tax lien
against Applicant in the amount of $12,630. The lien does not specify what years the lien
covers. (Item 4) Asked about this 2013 tax lien in his personal subject interview (PSI) with
an  agent  of  the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  in  January  2018,  Applicant
expressed his belief that the total amount of taxes he owed for tax years 2000-2004 and
2007  approximated  $28,000,  but  could  not  be  sure.  (Item  3)  His  estimate  bears  some
approximation  to  the  sum  covered  by  the  2013  federal  tax  lien  and  may  possibly
represent an over-estimate of taxes owed for these tax years. Without more information
from Applicant, though, no firm inferences can be drawn. Taxes covered by the 2013 tax
lien  and  any  additional  taxes  owed  for  these  years  that  make  up  Applicant’s  $28,000
estimate have neither been paid nor otherwise resolved or reconciled to date.
In May 2015, the IRS entered a second tax lien to cover calculated taxes owed for
tax  years  20l4  and  2015.  (Items  3-4)  This  lien  has  not  been  satisfied  and  remains
unresolved.  Besides his federal tax debts, Applicant is indebted to medical and consumer
creditors  holding  delinquent  accounts  exceeding  $17,000.  (Items  4  and  6-7)  Before
petitioning  for  Chapter  7  protection  in  2015,  these  debts  had  not  been  addressed  by
Applicant.
In December 2018, Applicant petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. (Item
7) What asset and claims schedules Applicant included in his Chapter 7 petition are not
documented. Without any special exceptions noted in his discharge order, his bankruptcy
discharge  is  presumed  to  cover  and  discharge  his  SOR-listed  medical  and  consumer
debts. Absent special circumstances not developed in his Chapter 7 petition, none of his
tax debts with the IRS were discharged in bankruptcy.
Applicant  attributed  some  of  his  debt  delinquencies  to  unemployment  conditions.
(Item  3)  In  his  PSI  with  an  OPM  investigator  in  January  2018,  Applicant  described  his
financial situation “as terrible” and assured that he would begin making monthly payments
on  all  of  his  listed  debts.  (Item  3)  To  date,  however,  he  has  provided  no  evidence  of
payments or payment plans with any of his listed  creditors.
Further,  Applicant  has  not  provided  any  evidence  of  financial  counseling,
performance evaluations, or civic contributions relevant and material to making a whole-
person  assessment  of  his  trustworthiness  and  reliability.  Without  this  additional
information, whole-person assessments are limited to his finances
