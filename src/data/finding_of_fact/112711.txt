In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b,
1.d, 1.g, and 1.h. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f. His admissions
in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 55-year-old safety manager employed by a defense contractor since
November 1993. He is twice married and divorced. He married his current spouse in 2015.
He has an adult daughter. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from February 1982
to July 1992 and received an honorable discharge. He attended a university from January
2005 to November 2011 and received a bachelor’s degree in business administration. He
has held a security clearance, but the record does not reflect when he received it.
In March 1995, Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and he received
a discharge in July 1995. He attributed the bankruptcy to his first divorce, which left him
with numerous debts. (FORM Items 3 and 9.) A February 2001 credit report reflects that
the  bankruptcy  included  loans  for  home  furnishings,  multiple  credit  cards  and  charge
accounts, a car loan, and several unsecured personal loans. (FORM Item 5.)
1  Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  security  clearance  application  (GX  2)  unless
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
In  December  2003,  Applicant  filed  a  petition  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy,  and  he
received a discharge on March 2004. The record does not reflect the number, nature, or
dollar amounts of the debts that were discharged. (FORM Item 9.) In his answer to the
SOR, he attributed this bankruptcy to his second divorce, but he provided no details.
In  January  2016,  Applicant  filed  a  petition  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy.  It  was
dismissed in March 2016 at his request. (FORM Item 10.) His petition listed secured debts
totaling $454,125 (including a home mortgage loan with a balance of $375,298 and four
delinquent car loans, including one loan for a luxury car), and unsecured debts totaling
$169,800. (Form Item 11 at 11, 20.) He listed his net monthly income as $8,018 and his
spouse’s net monthly income as $2,902. (FORM Item 11 at 24.) In his answer to the SOR,
he  attributed  this  bankruptcy  petition  to  overspending  on  his  most  recent  wedding.  He
dismissed the bankruptcy so that he could resolve his financial problems himself.
In  Applicant’s  response  to  the  FORM,  he  stated  that  he  supports  his  disabled
mother, and he was providing financial assistance to his 31-year-old daughter by making
her car payments and insurance payments. His daughter is now making her own car and
insurance payments. Applicant surrendered the car he bought for his daughter and now
owes  a  deficiency  of  $3,000  after  the  voluntary  repossession.  The  deficiency  is  not
alleged in the SOR.
Applicant also stated that his job required a relocation across the country, and he
was unable to sell his home for seven months at his old work location. However, he was
able to restructure his mortgage payment and is renting his previous home. (AX A.) His
wife has found employment at their new location, with a starting salary of $96,000 per
year, a $27,000 pay increase.
In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he submitted a copy of his contract with a
law firm he hired in October 2018 to assist him in challenging errors on his credit reports
(AX C.) A September 2018 credit report reflects a disputed debt, but it appears that this
dispute was filed before Applicant hired the law firm. (FORM Item 7 at 6.)
The SOR alleges the two Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharges (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b),
the Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition (SOR ¶ 1.c), and five delinquent debts incurred after
Applicant’s bankruptcy discharge in March 2004 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.h). Applicant’s bankruptcy
filings  and  delinquent  debts  are  reflected  in  credit  reports  from  February  2001  (FORM
Item 5), October 2014 (FORM Item 6) and September 2018 (FORM Item 7.) The evidence
concerning these debts is summarized below.
SOR  ¶  1.d:  car  loan  charged  off  for  $12,944.  Applicant  explained  that  he
purchased  this  car  for  his  brother,  who  failed  to  make  the  payments.  Applicant
surrendered the car to the creditor, who sold it. He submitted evidence of a settlement
agreement  in  which  the  creditor  agreed  to  accept  $3,900,  payable  in  24  monthly  $60
installments,  to  begin  in  August  2018.2  He  did  not  submit  documentation  showing  that
any payments have been made.
SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f: collection accounts for two debts to the same creditor
for $10,434 and $3,199. In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he stated that both accounts
were  current.  The  SOR  alleges  the  name  of  the  creditor  and  amounts  similar  to  the
amounts reflected in the credit reports, but it does not provide the account numbers for
these two debts. The October 2014 credit report reflects two accounts with this creditor,
both of which are reported as current. (FORM Item 6 at 7-8.) The September 2018 credit
report  also  reflects  two  accounts  with  this  creditor.  One  debt  has  the  same  account
number  as  one  of  the  debts  in  the  October  2014  credit  report  and  one  has  a  different
account number. One is past due for $63 and the other is past due for $265. No other
debts to this creditor are listed in either credit report. The credit reports establish that the
accounts are either current or than the amount of the debt has been substantially reduced.
SOR ¶ 1.g: credit-card account placed for collection of $1,772. In Applicant’s
answer to the SOR, he submitted evidence of a payment agreement providing for monthly
$25 payments, but he provided no documentary evidence that any payments had been
made.
SOR ¶ 1.h: credit-card account charged off for $463. In Applicant’s answer to
the  SOR,  he  admitted  this  debt  and  promised  to  make  arrangements  to  pay  it.  The
September 2018 credit report reflects that this debt was charged off for $463 and that it
is disputed. The record does not reflect the basis for the dispute. (FORM Item 7 at 6.) The
debt is not resolved.
