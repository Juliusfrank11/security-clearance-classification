In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  57-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  has  worked  for
his  current  employer  since  February  2018.  (FORM  Item  4.)  When  he  submitted  his
SCA,  he  had  been  employed  by  various  federal  contractors,  with  short  periods  of
unemployment  between  contracts,  since  at  least  October  2003.  He  was  deployed
overseas for most of the time. He was laid off in December 2016 and unemployed until
May 2017. He worked for other federal contractors from May 2017 until he was hired by
his current employer. His SCA reflects that he has never had a security clearance.
Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  September  1984  to
February  1989  and  received  an  honorable  discharge.  He  married  in  March  1985.  He
has three adult children.
The  SOR  alleges  six  delinquent  credit-card  accounts  reflected  in  credit  reports
from  October  2015  (FORM  Item  5)  and  April  2018  (FORM  Item  6)  and  totaling  about
$41,440. During the April 2018 PSI, Applicant told an investigator that he had 26 credit
cards  and  became  financially  overextended  because  of  his  son’s  health  problems,
several deaths in the family, and periods of unemployment. In his answer to the SOR,
he  stated  that  he  had  closed  all  his  credit-card  accounts  except  the  six  alleged  in  the
SOR.  (FORM  Item  4  at  3.)  The  evidence  concerning  the  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  is
summarized below.
1  Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  security  clearance  application  (FORM  Item  3)
unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c: three credit-card accounts issued by the same bank placed
for collection of $14,280; $4,755; and $2,550. In the April 2018 PSI, Applicant stated
that these accounts were paid in full. (FORM Item 4 at 3.) The April 2018 credit report
reflects  that  all  three  were  charged  off  in  June  and  July  2017.  (FORM  Item  6  at  10.)
When he answered the SOR in October 2018, he stated that he intended to repay these
debts,  but  he  provided  no  evidence  of  payments,  payment  agreements,  or  other
resolution of the debts.
SOR ¶ 1.d: credit-card account placed for collection of $5,258. In his answer
to the SOR, Applicant stated that he was making payments on this debt. He provided no
evidence of payments, payment agreements, or other resolution of this debt.
SOR  ¶  1.e:  credit-card  account  charged  off  for  $11,954.  This  account  was
charged off in October 2015. (FORM Item 5 at 5.) In the PSI, Applicant stated that this
debt  was  paid  in  full  in  2016  or 2017.  (FORM  Item  4  at  3.)  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,
Applicant  promised  to  pay  this  debt.  He  provided  no  evidence  of  payments,  payment
agreements, or other resolution of this debt.
SOR¶  1.f:  credit-card  account  charged  off  for  $2,643.  The  April  2018  credit
report reflects the account as charged off in April 2014. (FORM Item 6 at 11.) In the PSI
and  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  stated  that  had  paid  this  debt  in  full  in  2018.
(FORM  Item  4  at  4.)  He  did  not  submit  any  evidence  of  payments,  payment
agreements, or other resolution of this debt.
