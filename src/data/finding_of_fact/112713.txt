Applicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since 2001. He seeks to retain a security clearance.  He attended
college for a period, but he did not earn a degree. He married in 1990 and divorced in
2012.  He  married  for  the  second  time  in  2014.  He  has  four  children  and  two
stepchildren. (Transcript (Tr.) at 30-31, 42-43; GE 1)
Applicant has a history of financial problems, including unpaid federal and state
taxes. He has been paying the IRS through a payment plan for several years. His state
filed tax liens against him for $8,530 in 2007; $6,408 in 2011; and $8,727 in 2015.  His
finances became worse after his divorce, and he worried that he could lose his house to
foreclosure  or  his  state  would  seize  it  because  of  the  unpaid  taxes.  He  decided  that
Chapter  13  bankruptcy  was  his  best  recourse.  (Tr.  at  27-35;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 4-6)
Applicant  filed  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  case  in  May  2015.  Under  Schedule  D,
Creditors  Holding  Secured  Claims,  the  petition  listed  $247,368  in  claims,  including
$245,592  owed  on  a  mortgage  loan.  Under  Schedule  E,  Creditors  Holding  Unsecured
Priority  Claims,  the  petition  listed  an  “Unknown”  amount  owed  in  state  taxes.  The
petition  listed  $3,937  in  debts  under  Schedule  F,  Creditors  Holding  Unsecured
Nonpriority  Claims.  Applicant’s  state  filed  a  claim  for  $23,156  in  taxes,  penalties,  and
interest for tax years 2004, 2005, and 2006. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2; AE D,

The  bankruptcy  plan, which  was  approved  in  February  2016,  called for  monthly
payments of $675 for months 1 through 11; $800 for months 12 through 15; $1,000 for
months  16  through  21;  $1,200  for  months  22  through  33;  and  $1,425  for  months  34
through  60.  Court  records  indicate  the  payments  were  automatically  withheld  from
Applicant’s paychecks. (Tr. at 20; GE 2; AE G)
Applicant  was  nervous  about  losing  his  house,  and  he  sought  advice  from  a
company that specializes in assisting individuals facing foreclosure. He was advised to
file another Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. Either there was a miscommunication between
Applicant and the company, or the company provided him poor advice because he was
already in an active bankruptcy case. He filed a second Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in
September  2018.  In  October  2018,  the  bankruptcy  court  consolidated  the  two  cases
under the case number of the first case. (Tr. at 17-19, 24; GE 3; AE B)
In  March  2019,  Applicant’s  state  filed  a  claim  in  the  2018  bankruptcy  case  for
$7,735 in taxes, penalties, and interest for tax year 2006. I am satisfied that this was the
state  covering  itself  for  the  second  bankruptcy  case,  and  does  not  reflect  additional
taxes to what the state claimed in the 2015 case. (Tr. at 26-27; GE; AE F, G)
Applicant  completed  the  payments  required  by  the  bankruptcy  court,  and  his
dischargeable debts were discharged in August 2019. The trustee’s report indicates that
Applicant paid $51,576 into the plan, and had $3,752 refunded to him, leaving a net of
$47,823  that  was  paid  to  his  attorney,  trustee,  and  creditors.  Of  that  amount,  $5,355
was paid to his attorney and the trustee, and the remainder to his creditors. The trustee
paid $18,741 toward Applicant’s mortgage loan and $23,156 to Applicant’s state for his
income taxes. (Tr. at 25; GE; AE E-G)
Applicant’s  state  released  a  2011  tax  lien  for  $7,004  in  June  2018.  The  state
released the 2011 tax lien for $6,408 (SOR ¶ 1.c) in January 2019. The $8,530 tax lien
from 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.b) and the $8,727 tax lien from 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.d) were still in effect
in July 2018. There is no direct evidence that they have been released. However, I am
satisfied that all of the underlying taxes owed to his state were paid by the trustee. (Tr.
at 36-37; GE; AE A, C, F, G)
Applicant  received  financial  counseling  as  a  requirement  of  his  bankruptcy.  His
finances  are  currently  in  order.  He  credibly  stated  that  he  is  committed  to  fiscal
responsibility and paying his taxes when due. (Tr. at 26, 29-31, 41-44; GE 2)
