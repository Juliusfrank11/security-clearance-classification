Applicant is 50 years old.  She has been divorced three times: 1990, 1999, and
2009;  and  has  six  children,  ages  30,  28,  25,  21,  19  and  11.    She  has  two  Master’s
degrees.  She holds the position of Billing Manager and is seeking access to sensitive
information in connection with her employment.
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
The Government opposes Applicant’s request for access to sensitive information
on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following
findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.
The  Government  alleges  that  Applicant  is  not  eligible  for  a  public  trust  position
because she is financially overextended and at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to
generate  funds.    The  SOR  identified  fourteen  delinquent  debts  totaling  in  excess  of
$59,000.    Applicant  admitted  allegations  1.c.,  1.e.,  1.f.,  1.g.,  1.h.,  1.i.,  totaling  almost
$20,000  in  debt.   She  denied  the  remaining  allegations, or denied  them  in  part,  under
this guideline.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated September 22, 2017; and May 18,
2018,  reflect  that  the debts  are  still  owing.    (Government  Exhibits  4  and 5.)   Applicant
served in the United Sates Navy from June 1986 to December 1987 when she received
an honorable discharge.  She has worked for his current employer since May 2017.
When Applicant started working for her current employer, she states that she had
every  intention  of  developing  a  plan  to  resolve  her  debts.    Since  then,  she  has
experienced a series of major life events that have hindered her progress.  Over the last
year, Applicant learned that her father’s cancer returned.  She took a leave of absence
in  January  and again  in  February  to  be  with  him.   He  passed  away  in  February  2018.
Applicant’s own failing heath brought on by grief and stress took a toll on her, and she
underwent a surgery in August 2018, and a short period of disability.  Her step mother is
in  her  final  stages  of  life,  suffering  from  stage  4  brain  cancer.    Applicant  states  that
these  tragic  life  events  prevented  her  from  focusing  on  her  financial  issues.    In  her
response to the FORM, Applicant stated that she has now taken the necessary step to
rectify  her  financial  delinquencies.    In  the  way  of  documentary  evidence,  Applicant
provided  two  pay  stubs  to  show  that  she  is  making  her  child  support  payments,  flight
and funeral costs relating to her father’s passing, her disability documentation, and two
credit reports dated October 21, 2018.  (Applicant’s Exhibit A.)
