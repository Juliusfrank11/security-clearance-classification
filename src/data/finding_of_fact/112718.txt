In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR  and  the  amended  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  with
comments three, and a portion of a fourth, of the factual allegations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶
1.a. through 1.c., and a portion of SOR ¶ 1.d.).2  Applicant’s admissions and comments
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the
evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due  consideration  of  same,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  a  field  service  technician  with  his  current  employer  since  April  2010.  A  1985  high
school graduate, he received an associate’s degree in 1989. Applicant has never served
with the U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance, and it is unclear if he ever
held a position of public trust. Applicant was married in 1987, and divorced in 1988. He
was  remarried  in  1991,  and  divorced  in  1994.  He  married  again  in  2002.  He  has  four
children, born in 1987, 1993, 2003, and 2007.

Financial Considerations3
Applicant’s financial difficulties first arose in 2000, and they continued over a multi-
year period, essentially because he was withholding too little from his federal and state
income for tax purposes. As a result, over the years, a substantial number of federal and
state tax liens were filed against him for various amounts, with some as small as $50, and
one as large as $34,501.4 It took Applicant approximately one decade to resolve the state
income tax issues, and a number of them were released in 2014, 2015, and 2016. He
had a repayment plan with the state, and by paying the state approximately $9,800, the
state tax liens were eventually released. During the intervening period, a son was born in
2003  with  temporary  health  issues,  and  then  he  developed  other  conditions,  including
Attention Deficit Disorder, Learning Disability, Hyperactivity, Autism, and Epilepsy.5 The
medical expenses caused by those issues were approximately $8,000 per year.
Because Applicant also had similar issues with respect to his federal income taxes
involving  the  payment  of  insufficient  income  taxes,  and  the  imposition  of  increasing
interest, essentially during the period 2000 through 2009, in January 2009, he sought the
assistance  of  a  company  specializing  in  obtaining  tax  relief,  and  agreed  to  pay  them
$344.44  for  the  draft  modification  request  form,  plus  a  $25  fee.  Based  on  the  figures
presented to the company, an offer in compromise analysis was prepared.6 It is unclear
if it was rejected by the IRS or even submitted to the IRS. Nevertheless, federal tax liens

as discussed by the DOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess
an  applicant's  credibility;  (b)  to  evaluate  an  applicant's  evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed
circumstances;  (c)  to  consider  whether  an  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful  rehabilitation;  (d)  to
decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence
for whole-person analysis under Directive § 6.3.).  See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26,

were filed against Applicant in February 2009, in the amount of $34,501 (SOR ¶ 1.a.),
and in June 2009, in the amount of $7,533 (SOR ¶ 1.b.).7 In November 2018, Applicant
acknowledged that “a significant balance remains unpaid. I have paid some toward the
original debt though not much due to household (sic) bills and obligations.”8 While there
are  some  tax  very  recent  post-SOR  and  post-Notice  of  Hearing  payments  to  the  IRS:
$611.87 and $131.77 of the unpaid 2011 tax balance of $744.28 on March 21, 2019, and
April 10, 2019, when a total of $611.87 was paid, or tax refunds applied by the IRS, and
Applicant  contends  that  the  federal  tax  liens  are  no  longer  listed  on  his  credit  report,9
there is no evidence that those federal tax liens have been released.
Applicant’s federal income tax issues were not limited to simply failing to pay his
income taxes over the years. He also had a substantial history of failing to timely file his
federal  income  tax  returns  over  a  multi-year  period,  something  he  referred  to  as  “a
mistake.”10 For example, while it was not alleged in the SOR, Applicant failed to timely file
his  federal  income  tax  return  for  the  tax  year  2002,  and  as  of  April  24,  2019,  only  a
substitute  tax  return  was  prepared  by  the  IRS.11  Applicant  also  failed  to  timely  file  his
federal  income  tax  returns  for:  the  tax  year  2012,  until  August  3,  2015;12  the  tax  year
2013, until May 25, 2015;13 the tax year 2016, until April 1, 2019,14 although Applicant

10 Tr. at 29. The legal requirement to file a federal income tax return is based upon an individual’s
gross income and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined that there is an obligation to so file,
the following applies:
Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title
or  by  regulations  made  under  authority  thereof  to  make  a  return,  keep  any  records,  or
supply  any  information,  who  willfully  fails  to  pay  such  estimated  tax  or  tax,  make  such
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law
or  regulations,  shall,  in  addition  to  other  penalties  provided  by  law,  be  guilty  of  a
misdemeanor  and,  upon  conviction  thereof,  shall  be  fined  not  more  than  $25,000
($100,000  in  the  case  of  a  corporation),  or  imprisoned  not  more  than  1  year,  or  both,
together  with  the  costs  of  prosecution.  In  the  case  of  any  person  with  respect  to  whom
there is a failure to pay any estimated tax, this section shall not apply to such person with
respect to such failure if there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect
to such failure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the first
sentence of this section shall be applied by substituting "felony" for "misdemeanor" and "5
years" for "1 year."

claimed it was initially filed timely, but not properly recorded;15 and the tax year 2017, until
April 1, 2019.16
Applicant’s  reported  adjusted  gross  income  in  2014  was  $70,227;  in  2015,
$79,180;  in  2016,  $78,332;  and  in  2017,  $75,979.  Applicant  submitted  two  slightly
different Personal Financial Statements, both dated May 1, 2019, to reflect his $3,459.97
(versus  $3,173.71)  net  monthly  income;  $1,644  (versus  $1,814)  in  monthly  expenses;
and  a  purported  $1,082.64  (versus  $1,082.64),  not  including  any  payments  to  satisfy
federal  tax  liens  or  for  unpaid  income  taxes;  leaving  a  remainder  of  $733.33  (versus
$197.07)  that  might  be  available  for  discretionary  spending  or  savings.17  Both  of
Applicant’s Personal Financial Statements reflect that he has stocks and pensions worth
$100,000, a mobile home, a boat, a truck, and a luxury automobile.
Applicant’s only effort of obtain financial counseling appears to be his post-hearing
acquisition  of  a  book,  Total  Money  Makeover,  by  Dave  Ramsey,  a  national  radio  host
dealing primarily with financial issues.18 Applicant did not explain what corrective actions
he has taken over an extensive period to avoid the pitfalls or other factors that he identified
as the ones that caused him financial difficulties. He offered only generalized explanations
for his failures to routinely timely file his federal income tax returns; to make more timely
efforts to pay his unpaid federal income taxes; and to resolve his federal tax liens. While
he apparently has a monthly remainder of either $733.33 or $197.07, depending on which
version of his Personal Financial Statement is accurate, there is a paucity of evidence to
indicate that Applicant’s financial situation is now under control.
