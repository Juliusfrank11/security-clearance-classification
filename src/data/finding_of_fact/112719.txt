Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 46 years old and divorced. He has been employed by a government
contractor  since  March  2017.  He  worked  as  a  driver  for  a  ride-sharing  service  from
November 2016 to March 2017. He was unemployed from April 2016 to November 2016,
after he was “dismissed for absences” from a position with another government contractor
that he held from August 2016 to October 2016. He was also terminated from a position
he  held  from  September  2015  to  April  2016,  following  “missing  time  due  to  health
issue[s].”  He  was  employed  from  November  2011  to  September  2015  by  another
contractor. He was unemployed from November 2010 to October 2011 after being laid off
from a position he had held since 1998. (Item 2.)
Applicant is indebted to nine creditors in the total amount of $26,196 as listed in
the SOR. He also failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns for 2013 to 2016.
Applicant attributed these debts and his failure to file his tax returns to his divorce. He
stated  in  his  security  clearance  application,  “After  my  ex-wife  moved  out  and  we  got
divorced, it became increasingly difficult to keep up with bills and the[re] was no money
available to pay the tax.” Applicant indicated that he hired a law group to “discuss strategy
for paying back the IRS, debt consolidation and the possibility of filing Bankruptcy.” He
provided nothing further in this regard. (Item 2.) His debts are as follows.
Applicant is indebted on a charged-off automotive loan in the amount of $10,977,
as stated in SOR ¶ 1.a. This debt has been delinquent since at least May 2014. (Item 5;
Item 6.)
Applicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $6,059, as stated in
SOR ¶ 1.b. This debt has been delinquent since at least 2013. (Item 5; Item 6.)
Applicant is indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $4,209, as stated
in SOR ¶ 1.c. This debt was for a credit card account. It has been delinquent since 2013.
(Item 5; Item 6.)
Applicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $1,016, as stated in
SOR ¶ 1.d. This debt has been delinquent since at least 2016. (Item 5; Item 6.)
Applicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $621, as stated in
SOR ¶ 1.e. It has been delinquent since 2013. (Item 5; Item 6.)
Applicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $584, as stated in
SOR ¶ 1.f. It has been delinquent since 2011. (Item 5; Item 6.)
Applicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $362, as stated in
SOR ¶ 1.g. This debt was for a storage unit. It became delinquent in 2017. (Item 4.)
Applicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $1,342, as stated in
SOR ¶ 1.h. This debt became delinquent in 2017. (Item 4.)
Applicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $1,026, as stated in
SOR ¶ 1.i. This debt became delinquent in 2017. (Item 4.)
Applicant failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013
through 2016, as alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.j and 1.k.
Applicant  acknowledged  his  debt  and  indicated  he  was  trying  to  resolve  it.  He
stated:
As pertaining to the financial questions earlier, I would just like to state that
these issues came about after my divorce as I was trying to maintain my
living situation. The losing of my jobs at both [government contractors], as
discussed  earlier  did  not  help  this  situation.  Since  then  I  have  cut  my
monthly bills down to almost nothing and I am actively pursuing cleaning up
the situation. I am currently working with the [law group] on these matters,
and will have the situation resolved in the coming months. It was never the
goal to not pay or defraud any financial institution, it was simply being over
extended at the time. (Item 2.)
Despite Applicant’s  claim that  he  was  working  with  the  law  group to  resolve  his
debts, he failed to provide any documentation to support his claim or show that he was
otherwise working to resolve his delinquent accounts. He produced no evidence of filing
his state or Federal tax returns from 2013 to 2016.
