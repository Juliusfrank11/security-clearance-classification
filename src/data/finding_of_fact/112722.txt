In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted without comments nearly all of the
factual  allegations  in  the  SOR  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  through  1.j.,  1.l.  through  1.n.,  and  1.p.).
Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and
thorough  review  of  the  evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon due  consideration of  same, I
make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a senior administrative logistics analyst with his current employer since October 2015.
He  was  with  the  same  employer, in  a different  position  (warehouse  administrator)  and
location from June 2013 until June 2014. A 1995 high school graduate, Applicant received
a bachelor’s degree in 2017. He served in an enlisted capacity with the U.S. Navy from
March 1996 until he was honorably discharged in January 2007. He was granted a top
secret clearance in 2008. Applicant has never married. He has no children.
Financial Considerations1
During his enhanced subject interview conducted by an investigator from the U.S.
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  in  January  2018,  Applicant  attributed  his
financial issues to his loss of employment in October 2012, when the contract on which
he was working ended and he was laid off. He remained unemployed until June 2013.
Following  his  layoff,  while  he  was  no  longer  receiving  his  normal  wages,  each  month
1 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in
the following exhibits: Item 3 (e-QIP, dated October 10, 2017); Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated
January  24,  2018);  Item  4  (Subject  Contact,  dated  February  12,  2018);  Item  5  (Combined  Experian,
TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated  December 7, 2017); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated
June 4, 2018).
Applicant  received  $600  in  interest  and  dividends,  $1,969.70  from  the  GI  Bill,  and  a
Veterans Affairs benefit of $113. Applicant used his savings and various credit cards to
pay  his  bills,  and  he  cashed  out  his  401(k),  but  failed  to  properly  report  his  actions,
resulting  in  increased  state  and  federal  taxes.2  It  appears  that  most  of  his  accounts
became delinquent in 2015. Two other actions by Applicant have had a negative impact
on  his  financial  situation:  in  October  2014,  he  loaned  a  girlfriend  $6,850,  but  she  has
refused to pay him back, and he does not anticipate her doing so; and in 2014, he leased
a 2014 luxury sedan for a monthly payment of $599.
On  August  19,  2015,  in  a  seemingly  tactical  effort  to  save  his  residence  from
foreclosure, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
He listed assets worth $356,712, including real property worth $348,127; liabilities worth
$480,576. Included in that amount were $320,987 in secured claims ($285,012 mortgage
lien, $35,975 for a vehicle lease; $17,629 in unsecured nonpriority claims ($1,256 in state
taxes,  and  $16,373  in  federal  taxes);  and  $141,960  in  unsecured  nonpriority  claims
(various consumer accounts, including credit cards).3 At the time of his bankruptcy filing,
he reported a net monthly income of $5,681;4 $5,116 in expenses; and a remainder of
$565 available for saving or spending.5 By April 3, 2017, the bankruptcy trustee disbursed
a  total  of  $7,035,  including  $2,861  for  administration  expenses,  and  $4,174  to  two
creditors  combined.6  No  further  disbursements  were  made  to  any  of  the  remaining
creditors because, on April 3, 2017, Applicant moved to dismiss his bankruptcy case. An
order was issued dismissing the case and vacating all automatic stays and injunctions.7
In  addition  to  his  Chapter  13  bankruptcy,  the  SOR  identified  15  delinquent
accounts  that  had  been  placed  for  collection  or  charged  off  as  generally  reflected  by
Applicant’s December 2017 or June 2018 credit reports. For the vast majority of the debts,
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  had  made  no  effort  to  resolve  the  accounts  since  his
Chapter 13  bankruptcy  was  cancelled.8  Those  debts, most of  which  were  charged  off,
totaling approximately $173,797, are described below:
(SOR ¶ 1.a., automobile lease for $28,835 on a vehicle that was repossessed);
(SOR ¶ 1.b., credit card for $26,717); (SOR ¶ 1.c., credit card for $26,581); (SOR ¶ 1.d.,
credit card for $25,881); (SOR ¶ 1.e., credit card for $17,651); (SOR ¶ 1.f., credit card for
$8,535); (SOR ¶ 1.g., credit card for $8,266);  (SOR ¶ 1.h., credit card for $5,678); (SOR

card  for  $1,056);  (SOR  ¶  1.l.,  medical  account  for  $67);  (SOR  ¶  1.m.,  cellular  phone
account for $604); (SOR ¶ 1.o., federal taxes for $16,373 of which there was a partial
payment of $2,261.64 as part of the bankruptcy); and (SOR ¶ 1.p., state taxes for $1,256
that was actually paid off as part of the bankruptcy).9
Applicant claimed that his financial situation was “much better,” and while he has
not made any efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts, he is purportedly able to pay his
current bills.10 He denied having received any financial counseling or debt consolidation
services, but did indicate that he was looking into hiring a credit management company
to assist him in paying his debts. However, as of January 2018, he had not yet done so.11
Applicant  failed  to  indicate  his  current  monthly  net  pay,  monthly  expenses,  debt
payments, or if he has any monthly remainder that might be available  for discretionary
spending  or  savings.  There  is  no  evidence  of  a  budget.  In  January  2018,  the  OPM
investigator  requested  documentation  associated  with  Applicant’s  accounts,  and  in
October  2018,  Department  Counsel  noted  that  Applicant  still  had  not  provided  any
“documentary evidence proving that he has paid, is on a current repayment plan for, has
settled, or otherwise resolved any of his delinquent or charged off accounts.” That status
remains  unchanged.  Other  than  his  general  oral  statements,  Applicant  offered  no
evidence  to  indicate  that  his  financial  situation  has  improved,  or  that  it  is  now  under
control.
