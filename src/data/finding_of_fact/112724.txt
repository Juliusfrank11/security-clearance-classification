In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of the factual allegations in
the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a., 1.d., 1.f., and 1.g.). She denied with comments and attachments
the remaining allegations. Applicant’s admissions, comments, and the information in the
attachments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the
following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving
as a medical service coordinator with her current employer since February 2017. A 1988
high school graduate, she received an associate’s degree in 2006. Applicant has never
served with the U.S. military. She has never held a security clearance, and it is unclear if
she  ever  held  a  position  of  public  trust.  Applicant  was  married  in  1992.  She  has  two
children, born in 1993 and 1996.
Financial Considerations1
It  is  unclear  when  Applicant’s  financial  difficulties  first  arose,  although  those
problems and the unidentified circumstances that led to them were sufficient to motivate
her to voluntarily jointly file, with her husband, for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code in November 1996.  Deemed by the bankruptcy trustee as having no

November 21, 2017); Item 5 (Subject Contact, dated March 26, 2018); Item 6 (Response to Interrogatories,

December  31,  2018);  Item  7  (Bankruptcy  Petition,  filed  November  14,  1996);  and  Item  8  (Bankruptcy
Petition, filed May 3, 2007).
assets,  Applicant’s  unspecified  debts  were  discharged  in  March  1997.2  Although  her
financial slate was clean and she was given a fresh start following the 1997 bankruptcy
discharge,  unemployment  from  February  2007  until  April  2007,  as  well  as  various
unspecified circumstances and issues again arose within a decade, and in May 2007, she
again voluntarily jointly filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7.3 This time, she managed to
accrue $113,897 in debts to creditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims, essentially
consumer charge accounts, credit cards, medical bills, student loans, and vehicle-related
expenses.4  Recognizing  that  debts  for  most  student  loans  (Applicant  listed  $23,920  in
such loans) are not discharged, the bankruptcy judge discharged Applicant’s other debts
on August 22, 2007.5
Once again, the financial slate was clean and she was given another fresh start,
and once again, the cycle of financial difficulties reappeared, only this time, they did so
within four years, starting in 2011. She had been unemployed from September 2007 until
January 2008. In 2011, faced with foreclosure on her residence, she submitted a deed in
lieu of foreclosure; she drank heavily, consuming up to seven or eight drinks at a time
(when three or four led to intoxication), and she became intoxicated every weekend; and
she became depressed. While she timely filed her federal personal income tax return for
the tax year 2011, she failed to make her final payment of the accrued tax, interest, and
penalty,  until  November  2014.6  During  the  next  few  years,  additional  issues  arose
involving unspecified mental health treatment and additional periods of unemployment,
and she failed to pay her personal state income taxes for the year 2016, although she
told an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in November
2017 that she would start paying the estimated $790 owed starting the following month,7
something she failed to do as of March 2018.8 Instead, on an unspecified date, Applicant

purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered:
(a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or
changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;
(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide
evidence for whole-person analysis under Directive § 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd.

2006)). Applicant’s unlisted and unalleged delinquent accounts and other issues will be considered only for
the five purposes listed above.
and the state department of revenue entered into a repayment plan  calling for monthly
automatic $25 withdrawals.9
In addition to her two Chapter 7 bankruptcies, the SOR alleged five purportedly
continuing  delinquent  debts  totaling  $50,063  that  had  been  placed  for  collection,  as
follows:
(SOR  ¶  1.a.)  is  a  student  loan  with  a  total  unpaid  balance  of  $20,547  (which
subsequently increased to $22,306, as reflected in her December 2018 credit report), of
which $767 (which subsequently increased to $2,414, as reflected in her December 2018
credit report) was past due, for which Applicant has failed to report any efforts to resolve.10
In her October 2016 e-QIP, Applicant said that she planned to contact the creditor and
make  arrangements  to  get  the  debt  resolved,  and  since  she  had  just  obtained  a  new
higher-paying job, her efforts would commence “very soon.”11 In her June 2018 response
to the interrogatories, she indicated an intent to contact the creditor “to get caught up.”12
However, in her October 2018 Answer to the SOR, she admitted that the account remains
delinquent,  and  she  failed  to  mention  any  efforts  to  contact  the  creditor  to  resolve  the
account. According to her December 2018 credit report, Applicant made an unspecified
payment to the creditor in December 2017, but as of 12 months later, she was at least
120 days or more than four payments past due.13 The account has not been resolved.
(SOR  ¶¶  1.b.  and  1.c.) are  two  medical  accounts  with  unpaid balances  of  $572
and $315, which are under a combined repayment plan authorizing 18 monthly $50 debits
from  her  checking  account,  commencing  in  June  2018.14  Applicant  contended  in  her
Answer to the SOR that the two of the medical accounts were on repayment plans and
were being paid, but she failed to submit meaningful documentation, such as copies of
receipts or her bank account statements, to support her contentions that any payments
had been made. In the absence of such documentation, it is unclear if the accounts are
in the process of being resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.d.) is unpaid federal personal income tax for the tax year 2016 in the
amount of $4,164.10, as of July 2, 2018. Applicant was previously credited by the IRS
with making $100 payments on April 15, 2017, and again on September 13, 2017. No

12 It should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts
in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting
in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR

further  evidence  was  presented  showing  any  other  efforts  by  Applicant  to  resolve  the
delinquency,  and there  is  no  pending  installment  agreement.15  In  the  absence  of  such
evidence, that account has not been resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.e.) is unpaid small business taxes in the amount of $24,465 for the tax
years 2015 and 2016 owed by the limited liability company (LLC)16 that Applicant’s father
owned  and  for  which  he  was  the  registered  agent  and  responsible  party.17  Applicant
worked  full-time  as  general manager  or  office manager  of  the LLC from  January  2008
until  November  2015.18  In  January  2017,  the  IRS  informed  Applicant  that  she  was
responsible for the LLC’s taxes, and it combined the taxes owed by the LLC to Applicant’s
unpaid income taxes for the tax year 2011.
On  January  2,  2018,  a  financial  services  organization  specializing  in  tax  relief
issues, representing Applicant, wrote a letter to the IRS requesting abatement of penalties
associated  with  the  LLC’s  taxes.19  In  the  letter,  Applicant  was  described  as  not  the
individual responsible for financial decisions for the business, but was merely the day-to-
day office manager. She had no decision-making responsibilities with regard to payroll,
accounting,  or  bookkeeping.  She  was  directed  to  pay  only  those  bills  that  she  was
instructed to pay by her father. Faced with insufficient funds to keep the operation afloat,
Applicant requested that her father close it and sell the assets to pay for operating debt.
Exacerbating the situation were the deteriorating family dynamics following the demise of
Applicant’s  mother  and  the  severe  depression  of  her  father.  Applicant  attempted  to
withdraw from the LLC in early 2015, but her father threatened suicide if she left. She
refused to sign quarterly tax reports, and she was unaware of any issues involving the
IRS as her father was the sole individual associated with the LLC who was authorized to
do so.20 The IRS responded on several occasions in 2018, indicating that it was working
on the account, requesting additional information, and indicating on June 8, 2018, that
the matter had been forwarded to the Special Procedures function of Applicant’s area IRS
office.21

16 One of the most significant benefits of an LLC is that of pass-through taxes. The IRS treats one-
member LLCs as sole proprietorships for tax purposes. This means that the LLC itself does not pay taxes
and does not have to file a return with the IRS. LLC “owners” don't have to file a corporate tax return, but
simply reports their share of profit and loss on their individual tax return.
17 The “responsible party” is the person who ultimately owns or controls the entity or who exercises
ultimate effective control over the entity. The person identified as the responsible party should have a level
of control over, or entitlement to, the funds or assets in the entity that, as a practical matter, enables the
person, directly or  indirectly, to control, manage, or  direct the  entity and the disposition  of its funds and
assets. See IRS Instructions for Form SS-4, Rev. December 2017.

Applicant signed a 2013 Biennial Report for a state LLC in August 22, 2014, as the
office manager, and as such she was a person authorized by the company to sign the
report. However, the report in question clearly listed Applicant’s father as the registered
agent  for  the  LLC.  Applicant’s  name  on  the  report  is  only  her  signature  as  a  person
authorized by the company to sign the report, not as the responsible party.22 While the
information reflected in the IRS-directed documentation regarding Applicant’s status with
the  LLC  constitutes  a  scintilla  of  evidence  guessing  that  Applicant  was  a  “responsible
party” of the LLC, never actually identifying her as such, that level of evidence failed to
constitute substantial evidence of that fact. Accordingly, while Department Counsel noted
that DOHA is not the appropriate entity to determine Applicant’s status with respect to the
LLC  tax  liability,  such  a  position  does  not  prevent  me  from  weighing  the  evidence  to
determine if there is substantial evidence of Applicant’s liability and responsibility for the
LLC taxes. Further confusing the situation is that according to the Secretary of State’s
records, this particular LLC, identifying Applicant’s father as the registered agent of the
LLC, became inactive on April 10, 2012.23
Applicant’s joint family adjusted gross income was $80,567 for the tax year 2011;
$64,453 for the tax year 2012; $72,028 for the tax year 2013; $75,761 for the tax year
2014; $69,602 for the tax year 2015; and $53,774 for the tax year 2016.24
Other  than  a  certificate  of  credit  counseling  in  May  2007  associated  with
Applicant’s 2007 bankruptcy, and an inferred identical type of counseling associated with
her  1996  bankruptcy,  there  is  no  evidence  that  Applicant  has  received  more  recent
financial  counseling.  There  is no  evidence  of  a  budget.  Applicant did  not  explain  what
corrective actions she has taken over an extensive period to avoid the pitfalls or other
factors that she identified as the ones that caused her financial difficulties. She offered
only generalized explanations for her failure to make more timely attempts to resolve her
accounts. Furthermore, there is no Personal Financial Statement to reflect her current net
monthly income, monthly expenses, or any remainder available for discretionary use or
savings. There is no evidence to indicate that Applicant’s financial situation is now under
control.
