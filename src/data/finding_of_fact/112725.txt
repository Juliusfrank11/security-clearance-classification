Applicant  admitted  the  sole  SOR  allegation.  She  is  a  23-year-old,  native-born
U.S. citizen. As of the date of the hearing, she was single with no children. She obtained
a high-school diploma in 2014. She has since attended college but had not yet earned a
degree. She has held a security clearance since October 2015, when she enlisted in the
National Guard. She has worked as a security officer for her current employer, a DOD
contractor, since July 2018. (Tr. at 5-7, 8-9, 22-26, 43-44, 52-54; GE 1-2)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant’s  brother  is  a  citizen  of  Senegal  currently
residing  in  Applicant’s  U.S.  residence  as  an  undocumented  alien.  Applicant’s  parents
immigrated to the United States from Senegal in 1991, before she was born. She listed
on  her  October  2015  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  that  her  72-year-old  father,
61-year-old  mother,  37-year-old  brother,  35-year-old  brother,  and  33-year-old  sister
were  Senegalese-born  citizens  residing  in  the  United  States  as  undocumented  aliens.
She testified that she has extended family members residing in the United States. She
was unaware of the U.S. citizenship status of her aunts and uncles, but she knew that
their  children  were  native-born  U.S.  citizens.  She  also  has  extended  family  members
residing in Senegal, but she does not maintain contact with them. (Tr. at 31-38, 41-42,
46, 48; GE 1-2)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  she  believed  her  parents  began  the
lengthy  process  of  applying  for  their  green  cards  in  approximately  2013,  and  they
recently received them as her mother has twice traveled to Senegal. She testified that
they  intend  on  becoming  U.S.  citizens.  She  testified  that  her  37-year-old  brother
obtained  U.S.  citizenship  through  his  then-spouse  or  children,  and  she  informed  the
DOD background investigator of such in 2017. She also testified that her sister married
a U.S. citizen, through whom her sister was being sponsored for U.S. citizenship. (Tr. at
31-38, 49-50; GE 1-2)
Applicant  testified  that  her  35-year-old  brother,  who  is  the  subject  of  the  SOR
allegation,  told  her  that  he  was  a  Deferred  Action  for  Childhood  Arrivals  (DACA)
recipient, but his DACA status was revoked as a result of his criminal involvement. She
was unaware of his citizenship status as of the date of the hearing. She testified that as
of the date of the hearing, he had been incarcerated since approximately April 2019 for
an assault charge that was pending trial. He was twice previously arrested: the first for a
marijuana possession charge and the second for a marijuana possession charge and a
firearm  violation.  She  testified  that  there  was  an  immigration  hold  on  him  and  she
believed he would ultimately be deported. (Tr. at 35-36, 38-40, 42-43, 48-52)
Applicant listed on her SCA that she had been living with her parents since 2007.
She testified that she lived with them until February 2017, when she moved out to live
with  a  previous  partner  or  on  her  own.  She  testified  that  other  than  when  she  was  in
high  school,  both  she  and  her  35-year-old  brother  lived  with  their  parents  during  only
one other occasion--an eight-month period from approximately 2016 until January 2017
when she could not afford to live on her own and they had to sponsor him as a condition
of his probation for one of his previous arrests. She testified that “he was just staying on
the  couch  until he  could  figure  out  somewhere  else  to  go.” He  then  moved out  before
she  did  and  she  has  not  since  resided  with  him.  She  testified  that  she  saw  him  daily
when  they  both  lived  with  their  parents;  she  contacted  him  once  monthly,  primarily  by
telephone, after they moved out of their parents’ home; and she eliminated contact with
him  after his  2019  incarceration  because  she  did  not  want  his  criminal  involvement  to
jeopardize her career. (Tr. at 4-5, 15-16, 26-31, 35-36, 38-40, 42-48; GE 1)
Applicant testified that her parents and sister are aware of her employment as a
DOD  contractor,  and  she  was  unsure  whether  her  brothers  were  also  aware.  She
testified  that  she  has  not  sponsored  anyone  for  U.S.  citizenship  and  had  no  future
intentions  of  doing  so.  She  testified  that  she  did  not  have  any  unfavorable  issues  at
work, and she received an increase in rank in the U.S. military from an E-2 to an E-3 as
well as U.S. Army Achievement Medals. (Tr. at 40-41, 47, 50, 52-53)
