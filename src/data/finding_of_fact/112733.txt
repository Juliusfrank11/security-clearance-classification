The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  16  charged-off,  in-collection,  or  delinquent
accounts  (¶¶  1.a  –  1.p)  totaling  about  $36,000;  that  he  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal
income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2016  and  2017  (¶  1.q);  and  that  he  owes  $6,295  in
past-due  federal taxes  for  tax  year  2015  (¶  1.r),  and  $2,492  for  tax  year  2017  (¶  1.s).
Applicant denied SOR ¶¶ 1.k, 1.l, and 1.n, and admitted all of the remaining allegations.
His  SOR  admissions,  and  those  at  the  hearing,  are  incorporated  herein  as  findings  of
fact.  After  a  thorough  review  of  the  record  evidence,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  is  a  2002  high
school  graduate,  and  he  enlisted  in  the  U.S.  Navy  in  October  2002,  where  he  served
honorably  until  his  discharge  as  an  E-4  in  November  2010.  He  believes  that  he
possessed a clearance during his service, but is not sure. Applicant married in 2003 and
divorced  in  2014.  He  has  four  children,  ages  19,  18,  7,  and  2.  Applicant  attended
college  between  2007  and  2010,  and  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree.  His  student  loans
were in forbearance as of April 2018. (GE 3)
Applicant’s  work  history  (2017  SCA)  indicates  that  after  his  discharge  from  the
service he worked part-time between November 2010 and March 2013; was employed
as a transportation driver between March 2013 and October 2016; and was hired by the
federal  contractor  currently  sponsoring  his  clearance  in  October  2016.  His  interim
clearance was withdrawn pending the adjudication of the financial concerns in the SOR,
and  he  was  laid  off.  Thereafter,  he  has  been  working  for  different  companies  for  less
income.
In  his  response  to  Section  26  (Financial  Record)  of  his  2017  SCA,  Applicant
denied having financial problems and responded “NO” to questions asking whether he
had any delinquent, in-collection, or charged-off accounts. He also failed to disclose that
he did not timely file his federal income tax return for tax years 2016 and 2017 and that
he owe federal taxes for tax years 2015 and 2017.
Applicant  timely  filed  his  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  year  2015.  He
requested an extension to file his tax year 2016 federal income tax return, but failed to
file it on time. He filed his 2016 and 2017 federal and state income tax returns in August
1,  2018, and  was  assessed  penalties  and  interest for not  pre-paying  his taxes  and for
filing late. (AE 4, GE 4, AE 7) Applicant received a $2,991 refund for tax year 2018 that
was applied to taxes owed for tax year 2015.
Concerning the SOR accounts that he denied, Applicant is disputing SOR  ¶ 1.k
because he believes this is a credit card opened by his ex-wife in his name, but without
his consent. In his April 2018 interview, Applicant claimed that the creditor promised not
to  hold  him  responsible  for  the  delinquent  account  if  he  submitted  documentary
evidence of his divorce. Applicant presented no documentary evidence at the hearing to
show  he  disputed  this  account  through  the  credit  bureaus  or  with  the  creditor;  that  he
was  released  from  responsibility  by  the  creditor;  or  that  the  account  belonged  to  his
wife.
Applicant  is  disputing  SOR  ¶  1.l  because  he  believes  that  the  Department  of
Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  was  required  to  pay  for  his  college  tuition  under  the  GI  Bill
education benefits program. However, Applicant failed to complete the semester. Thus,
the  VA  will  not  likely  pay  for  this  tuition  expense.  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  1.n,  and
initially  stated  he  disputed  it.  However,  at  his  hearing  he  admitted  that  this  was  his
account and it is delinquent. (Tr. 46)
Applicant retained the services of  a debt relief company seeking help  to pay off
his debts on November 8, 2018. He stated his intention to pay off his delinquent debts
through this program. He testified that all of the SOR accounts were included in the debt
relief program, except for his tax debts. However, only the accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶
1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.m were enrolled in the program. Applicant apparently made
two payments into the program and stopped. He presented no documentary evidence to
show  how  much  and  how  frequently  he  has  been  contributing  into  the  program,  and
whether any accounts have been paid through it. Applicant presented little documentary
evidence to show that he has many any payments, established payment arrangements,
disputed any accounts, or otherwise resolved any of the accounts alleged in the SOR.
(Tr. 42) He documented a one-time payment to the debt alleged in SOR 1.h.
Applicant  is  not  interested  in  addressing  his  delinquent  accounts  promptly.  He
believes  that  the  longer  he  waits  to  address  them  the  better  settlement  offers  he  will
receive from his creditors. (Tr. 43) His seven delinquent medical accounts resulted from
periods of unemployment or when he did not have insurance.
Concerning  his  delinquent  taxes,  Applicant  explained  that  in  2015  he  was
working as an independent contractor for the first time and he did not understand his tax
responsibilities. He failed to  pay estimated taxes, and when he filed for tax year 2015,
he realized he did not have the documents he needed. As a result, he was assessed a
large tax liability. The problem was aggravated when he failed to timely file his income
tax  returns  for  tax  years  2016  and  2017  because  he  was  afraid  of  his  possible  tax
liability.
Applicant  entered  into  a  payment agreement  with  the  IRS to pay  his delinquent
taxes for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017 on November 8, 2018. He agreed to pay $112
on the first of each month. He submitted documentary evidence showing he made  two
payments.  Applicant  testified  that  he  had  to  stop  making  the  payments  because  his
earnings were insufficient to pay for his debts and living expenses. He claimed he told
the IRS to suspend the payment agreement until he was making more money. (Tr. 50-
51)
Applicant  noted  that  he  has  made  substantial  progress  paying  his  delinquent
taxes. The IRS has been applying his refunds to his tax debt. He owed $3,686 for tax
year 2015. In 2016, he received a $1,255 refund that was applied to his debt. In 2017,
he was assessed a tax liability of $2,575. In 2018, he received a refund of $2,991 that
also was applied to his debt. As of his hearing date, Applicant owed federal taxes in the
amount of $2,215 for tax years 2015 and 2017. (AE 9) Applicant believes that if he had
timely filed his income tax returns he would not have had any problems, but since “[he]
let it go so far it became a problem.”
Applicant explained that when he was discharged in 2010, he was working, going
to school, and had his own security business. Then his wife had a baby, they divorced
in 2014, and within a year everything went haywire. His ex-wife went her own separate
way  and  money  was  just  pouring  out  of  his  pockets.  During  that  time,  he  was  only
thinking  about  his  survival,  paying  child  support,  helping  out  his  ex-wife,  while  at  the
same  time  trying  to  keep  a  roof  over  his  head,  and  his  financial  situation  became
unbearable. (Tr. 47)
Applicant  expressed  remorse  for  not  filing  his  income  tax  returns  on  time.  He
claimed  that  he  has  learned  a  hard  lesson  and  promised  to  timely  file  his  income  tax
returns and to pay his taxes in the future.
At  hearing,  Applicant  stated:  “I  have  been  in  this  process  for  my  security
clearance for over two years and it really made me take a look at how I’m handling my
finances. These are my problems and they are something that I have to fix.” He believes
that he is doing the best he can do in his current circumstances. He noted that he has
not been consistently employed since he was in the service. He is concerned about not
getting his clearance and losing his job.
