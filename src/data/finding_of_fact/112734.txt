Applicant admitted the SOR financial allegations, except for SOR 1.l.  He is a 43-
year-old project manager employed by a U.S. defense contractor since February 2015.
He  served  honorably  in  the  U.S.  military  from  March  1995  to  March  2015,  when  he
retired.  He  was  recently  divorced  from  his  second  wife  (June  2018).  They  had  two
children  together  before  separating  in  April  2016.  He  seeks  to  retain  the  clearance
which was most recently renewed in February 2006 (GE 2).
The  SOR  alleges,  Government  exhibits  (Items  2-7)  substantiate,  and  Applicant
admits  11  delinquent  debts  totaling  over  $66,000  (SOR  1.b-1.k  and  1.m).  Applicant
denies SOR 1.l, which is established by Item 6. Applicant also admits having his house
foreclosed  upon  in  November  2016  (SOR  1.a),  filling  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy
protection in October 2015 (SOR 1.n), and having a state tax lien in March 2015 (SOR
1.o).3
Applicant  reported  filing  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy protection  on  his  November
2015  clearance  application  (Item  2).  The  October  2015  filing,  listed  $106,000  in
delinquent  debt,  and  encompassed  most  of  the  SOR  debts.  Applicant  discussed  the
SOR debts during his October 2016 interview with a Government investigator (Item 3),
based on his November 2015 credit report (Item 4). The Chapter 13 petition had been
dismissed for non-payment in April 2016, when he and his wife separated.
Applicant’s December 2018 Answer (Item 1) enclosed copies of the final divorce
decree  and  supporting  documents,  and  some  records  from  a  consumer  credit
counseling  organization.  It  also  contained  a  September  2018  letter  from  Applicant’s
bankruptcy lawyer to Applicant’s ex-wife’s divorce lawyer, proposing that Applicant and
his  ex-wife  jointly  file  separate  bankruptcy  petitions  to  resolve  their  marital  debt.  The
divorce decree specifies that Applicant is responsible for most of the marital debt, and
his credit reports (Items 4-6) indicate that most of the debts are his individual accounts.
The record contains no indication whether or what response was received to Applicant’s
offer, which included Applicant paying for his ex-wife’s bankruptcy-filing expenses.
Applicant  attributed  their financial problems to  his  then-wife  losing her  teaching
job in 2011, and remaining unemployed until August 2015. They used their credit cards
to pay their ongoing living expenses. Yet, there is no evidence of any efforts undertaken
by  her  to  regain  employment  or  cut  their  living  expenses  during  that  time.  When  she
became  re-employed,  they  tried  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  but  that  effort  was  overtaken,
and their finances further complicated, by their April 2016 separation.
Applicant  presumably  received  the  credit  counseling  required  as  a  precondition
for  filing  his  bankruptcy  petition  in  2015.  However,  he  provided  no  current  budget  or
The tax lien was due to Applicant’s then-wife settling some delinquent debts for less than the balance owed,
thereby generating reportable  income which they did not include on there 2014 state income tax return.
Applicant paid the lien as soon as he became aware of it.
financial  statement  to  show  that  he  is  otherwise  meeting  his  current  living  expenses.
Moreover, the fate of his contemplated bankruptcy filing remains unknown. A Chapter 7
discharge  would  give  him  a  fresh  start.  A  Chapter  13  plan  would  require  a
demonstration of sufficient income to manage the plan payments. Finally, he provided
no work or character references, or any evidence of community involvement.
