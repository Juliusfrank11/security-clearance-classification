Applicant  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance,  although  he  has  held  a
security clearance in the past. (Tr. 5-6) He works as a principal systems engineer for a
large company in the defense industry. He has been so employed since October 2017.
His formal education includes  a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering awarded
in  1997,  and  a  master’s  degree  in  systems  engineering  awarded  in  2011.  He  is  51,
married, and has a 19-year-old stepdaughter.
As reflected in his security clearance application, Applicant’s employment history
is  a  bit  irregular,  in  that  he  has  held  multiple  jobs  in  several  locations  over  the  last
decade. (Exhibit 1) Since completion of his master’s degree in 2011,  he has had three
periods of unemployment: (1) from April 2012 to September 2012, a period of about six
months; (2) from December 2012 to March 2013, when he decided to take some time
off  after  his  father  passed  away  in  November  2012;  and  (3)  from  February  2017  until
October  2017,  when  he  began  his  current  employment.  His  employment  history
includes federal employment as a mechanical engineer for the U.S. Navy during 2002-
2006,  when  he  was  granted  the  privilege  of  a  security  clearance  in  September  2002.
(Exhibit 1 at 44)
The  SOR  alleged  and  Applicant  admitted  a  history  of  financial  problems.  The
SOR allegations consisted of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, filed in 2005 and discharged
in  2006,  and  seven  delinquent  accounts,  either  charged  off  or  in  collection,  ranging  in
amounts from $314 to $15,139 for a total of about $57,681. In his answer, he denied the
$314 collection account and indicated he was suing in small claims court to rectify the
matter.  In  addition  to  his  admissions,  the  matters  in  the  SOR  are  established  by  the
documentary evidence. (Exhibits 3-7)
Applicant attributed the Chapter 7 bankruptcy case to a business failure. (Tr. 21-
29) He bought a business (a gas station) in about 1999 or 2000, the business  was not
profitable,  and  it  failed  about  a  year  after  the  purchase.  Applicant  stated  that  the
business failure was due to the seller’s deliberate overstatement or misrepresentation of
the business’s financials. He delayed filing the bankruptcy case until 2005 because he
wanted  to  pay  his  debts.  The  bankruptcy  paperwork  shows  he  claimed  $87,307  in
liabilities of which $79,400 was unsecured indebtedness. (Exhibit 3)
financial  problems
Post-bankruptcy,  Applicant  attributed  his
to  periodic
unemployment as well as the time, effort, and money he devoted over a period of years
providing care for his ailing father, who eventually passed away in November 2012. (Tr.
29-34, 74-75) Per his security  clearance  application,  he  reported full-time  employment
for a state government as a caregiver from March 2008 to October 2011. (Exhibit 1 at
23) He also explained that his ability to resolve his financial problems was hindered by a
loss  of  documents  due  to  storm  damage  from  Hurricane  Harvey  in  2017.  (Tr.  36-37;
Exhibit E)
Concerning  the  seven  delinquent  accounts  for  about  $57,681,  Applicant
established  that  he  settled  the  $1,282  charged-off  account  for  $400  in  October  2018,
and  paid  in  full  the  $1,253  charged-off  account  in  July  2018.  (Exhibits  K  and  J,
respectively;  Tr.  51-54)  Applicant  did  not  present  documentation  to  show  that  the  five
remaining  delinquent  accounts  were  paid,  settled,  compromised,  in  a  payment
arrangement, cancelled, or forgiven.
Applicant disputes the validity of the $314 collection account, which stems from a
claim  of  money  owed  after  he  vacated  an  apartment.  (Tr.  54-58)  He  claims  the
apartment was in good condition when he vacated, and he refuses to pay the debt. In
May 2019, he initiated a small-claims court action suing the creditor. (Exhibit Q)
Three  of  the  delinquent  accounts  are  with  the  same  creditor,  a  federal  credit
union,  consisting  of  a  charged-off  account  for  $13,506,  a  charged-off  account  for
$12,916,  and  a  collection  account  for  $15,139.  (Tr.  37-46,  75-80)  The  delinquent
accounts are reflected in credit reports from February 2016, October 2017, June 2018,
and  November  2018.  (Exhibits  4-7)  The  $15,139  collection  account  is  not  reflected  in
the  most  recent  credit  reports  from  2018,  while  the  two  charged-off  accounts  are
reflected  in  all four credit  reports.  Applicant discussed  these  accounts  at  length  during
the hearing, he disputed the validity of a third delinquent account with the credit union,
but I found his testimony to be unclear. Given the ambiguity, and based on the clarity of
the  four  credit  reports,  I  find  the  current  existence  of  the  two  charged-off  accounts  for
$13,506 and $12,916, but not the $15,139 collection account.  Applicant stated that he
made some efforts to resolve the accounts, including an impromptu in-person inquiry at
a branch office of the credit union. (Tr. 77-80) But the two charged-off accounts are still
outstanding,  and  Applicant  did  not  have  a  plan  in  place  to  address  them.  The  two
charged-off accounts are unresolved.
The other delinquent account is a $13,271 charged-off account stemming from a
deficiency balance on an automobile loan after involuntary repossession. (Tr. 46-51, 63-
73)  Applicant  purchased  the  vehicle  in  2015  for  his  job  at  the  time.  He  made  the
monthly payments on the loan until he defaulted in about June 2017, which was during
his most recent period of unemployment from February 2017 until October 2017. He did
not make any payments on the deficiency balance, leading to the charged-off account.
Applicant stated that the account was purchased by another creditor, and that he will do
his best to resolve it. The account is unresolved.
Applicant  stated  that  his  current  financial  situation  is  under  control,  that  he  is
meeting his current living expenses, and he is not incurring new delinquent debts. (Tr.
58-60) His annual salary is about $135,000. His wife is not employed outside the home.
He  has  a  401(k)  account  with  a  balance  of  about  $22,000.  He  reported  having  about
$1,500  in  a  checking  account  and  two  paid-off  automobiles.  A  checking  account
statement reflected a balance of $2,540 as of April 30, 2019. (Exhibit H)
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the  burden  of  proof  is  less  than  a  preponderance  of  evidence.3  The  DOHA  Appeal
Board  has  followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s findings  of  fact  are  reviewed
under the substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following

burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for

a favorable clearance decision.6
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
With that said, it is important to note that a security clearance case is not a debt-
collection  procedure.  It  is  a  procedure  designed  to  evaluate  an  applicant’s  judgment,
reliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010).
An  applicant  is  not  required,  as  a  matter  of  law,  to  establish  resolution  of  every  debt
alleged  in  the  SOR.  An  applicant  need  only  establish  a  plan  to  resolve  the  financial
problems  and  take  significant  actions  to  implement  the  plan.  There  is  no  requirement
that  an  applicant  make  payments  on  all  the  delinquent  debts  simultaneously,  nor  is
there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No.
07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;
AG  ¶  20(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶¶ E3.1.14 and E3.1.15.
downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  a  death,  divorce,  or
separation,  clear  victimization  by  predatory  lending  practices,  or  identity
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and
AG ¶ 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy
of  the  past-due  debt  which  is  the  cause  of  the  problem  and  provides
documented  proof  to  substantiate  the  basis  of  the  dispute  or  provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.  The
disqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.
To  begin  discussion  of  the  delinquent  accounts,  I  am  not  concerned  about  the
unpaid $314 collection account stemming from the apartment rental. Applicant disputes
the validity of the debt under the terms of AG ¶ 20(e), and experience teaches that such
debts are  often  bogus.  More  to  the point,  the  debt  is so  minor that  it  does  not  raise a
concern, either alone or together with the other delinquent accounts. It is resolved under
the mighty legal doctrine of de minimis non curat lex (= the law does not concern itself
with trifles).
Turning  to  the  matters in  mitigation,  Applicant’s  financial problems  are  due  to  a
combination of factors: (1) the business failure in the early 2000s, which led to the 2005-
2006  Chapter  7  bankruptcy;  (2)  the  time,  effort,  and  money  he  devoted  caring  for  his
ailing father over a period of years, which ended with his father’s passing in November
2012;  and  (3)  his
three  periods  of  unemployment  during  2012-2017.  Those
circumstances  were  largely  beyond  his  control.  Applicant  acted  responsibly  under  the
circumstances by  seeking  employment  and attempting  to pay  his debts.  Nevertheless,
despite full-time work since October 2017, the financial problems persist to this day, as
evidenced  by  the  remaining  three  charged-off  accounts  in  amounts  of  $13,506,
$13,271,  and  $12,916,  for  a  total  of  nearly  $40,000.  Given  the  circumstances,  the
mitigation  condition  at  AG  ¶  20(b)  applies  in  part,  but  Applicant  does  not  receive  full
credit in mitigation.
It  is  too  soon  to  tell  if  Applicant  will  initiate  and  adhere  to  a  good-faith  effort  to
resolve  the  remaining  delinquent  debts.  With  that  said,  he  receives  credit  for  the
progress  he  made  in  2018  for  paying  off  or  settling  the  two  smallest  charged-off
accounts for a total of less than $2,000. But Applicant is still facing a small mountain of
delinquent debt, nearly $40,000 for the three charged-off accounts. The record does not
support a  conclusion that  he  can formulate a  realistic  plan  and  then follow  through  on
that plan to address the indebtedness. Indeed, I got the impression that he intended to
do  nothing  further  with  the  charged-off  accounts  with  the  credit  union.  In  light  of  the
high-dollar amount and age of some of the debts, it is unlikely that those debts will ever
be paid. Given the circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG ¶ 20(d) does not apply
in Applicant’s favor.
Although  Applicant  presented  some  evidence  in  mitigation,  I  am  not  persuaded
that he is making an honest effort to repay his creditors for the three remaining charged-
off accounts for nearly $40,000. There  are not clear indications that he is repaying the
three  charged-off  accounts,  or  that  he  has  realistic  plans  to  do  so  in  the  near  future.
Taking everything into account, the evidence shows a long-standing pattern of financial
problems,  which  are  largely  unresolved  and  ongoing.  The  evidence  is  not  sufficient  to
mitigate  his  history  of  financial  problems.  The  financial  considerations  concern  is  not
mitigated.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent  standard,  I  have  doubts  about
Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or
sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence  as  a  whole
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or  vice
versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he did not meet his
ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  show  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
