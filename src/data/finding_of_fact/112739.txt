Applicant is 42 years old. He has been married to his wife since 2001, and they
have three children. He received a bachelor’s degree in 2000, and he has worked for his
current employer as a senior systems engineer since October 2013. He has continuously
held a top secret security clearance since 2003. (GE 1; AE 11 at 6; Tr. 10-11, 23-24)
In  2002,  Applicant  and  his  wife  purchased  a  home  for  $253,500  with  a  30-year
mortgage from Bank A. In approximately 2004, the loan was transferred to Bank B, and
Applicant continued to make his $2,800 monthly mortgage payments. (GE 1; GE 2 at 1;
GE 3 at 6; GE 4; GE 7; AE 11 at 2-3; AE 13; Tr. 26, 34-36)
In  2005,  Applicant  took  out  a  $70,000  home  equity  line  of  credit  (HELOC)  from
Bank C to consolidate his debt and make improvements to his house. The payments were
approximately $180 a month. In July 2015, Applicant sent a letter to Bank C requesting
the  bank produce  the promissory  note  that  he  signed  when  he  opened  the account  to
affirm that Bank C still owned the loan. He sent this letter due to information he learned
regarding global mortgage fraud. Bank C did not respond to his letter. Applicant made his
last payment to Bank C in December 2015, and the account was ultimately charged off
by Bank C in the amount of $69,473. (GE 2 at 1; GE 3 at 8; GE 7; AE 4; Tr. 26, 36-41,
63)
In January 2016, Applicant sent a request for debt validation to Bank B regarding
his primary mortgage. During 2016, he made inconsistent mortgage payments and made
his last payment toward the debt in late 2016 or early 2017. During his December 2017
interview, Applicant stated that he stopped making payments and wanted verification of
the debt, because he never signed a promissory note with Bank B. He believed that his
actions were valid based upon information he learned from the news.  He did not consult
with  an  attorney  before  he  ceased  making  payments  to  the  mortgage  or  HELOC
accounts. Applicant testified that Bank B did not respond to his request for validation. The
outstanding  loan  balance  is  nearly  $320,000,  and  the  account  is  almost  $50,000
delinquent. (GE 2 at 1; GE 3 at 6; AE 5; AE 11 at 2-3; AE 13; Tr. 26, 34-36, 40-42, 44-47,
50)
In  February  2017,  Bank  B  sent  Applicant  notice  of  its  intent  to  foreclose  on  his
home.  A  month  later,  Applicant  and  his  wife,  representing  themselves,  filed  a  lawsuit
against Bank B, claiming they no longer owed Bank B any money. In April 2018, a stay
was  entered  to  prevent  Bank  B  from  foreclosing  on  Applicant’s  home  pending  the
outcome of his lawsuit against Bank B. (GE 4; GE 5; GE 6; AE 5; AE 11 at 2-3; AE 13;
Tr. 46-48, 50-)
In  June  of  2018,  the  court  found  in  favor  of  Bank  B  and  dismissed  Applicant’s
lawsuit.  That  same month,  Applicant filed for  Chapter 7  bankruptcy  to  prevent  Bank B
from  foreclosing  on  his  home.  Shortly  thereafter,  the  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  was
dismissed, because it was determined that Applicant had sufficient income and resources
to pay his financial obligations. In July 2018, Applicant appealed the court’s dismissal of
his lawsuit. (GE 5; GE 6; GE 7; Tr. 27-29, 48, 50)
Applicant testified that in August 2018, the Chapter 7 bankruptcy was converted
into a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to allow him to resolve the mortgage and HELOC debts. He
also wanted the trustee to determine if the mortgage and HELOC debts were valid. There
was  no  evidence  presented  during  the  hearing  that  Applicant  made  any  bankruptcy
payments. (GE 7; Tr. 27-28, 49, 51-53)
In  October  2018,  the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  was  dismissed  based  upon
Applicant’s request. According to Applicant, the bankruptcy was no longer necessary to
protect his interest in his home, because the mortgage debt and HELOC were “paid in
full” and he wished to “pursue his claims against” Bank B and Bank C in state court. At
the hearing, Applicant reiterated that he paid in full the mortgage debt and HELOC, and
this belief is reflected in his personal financial statement. (GE 7; AE 2; AE 3; AE 6; AE 7;
AE 8; AE 9; AE 10; AE 12; Tr. 27-28, 33, 51-52, 67)
Applicant testified that his failure to pay his primary mortgage and HELOC is based
on a civil dispute, not an inability to pay the mortgages, as he is able to live within his
means. If he is found to be legally responsible for the two mortgage debts, he claimed he
will  pay  both  debts.  Applicant  continues  to  reside  in  the  home  with  his family,  and  the
foreclosure proceedings are stayed, pending the outcome of Applicant’s appeal. Applicant
is representing himself in the appeal process. (GE 5; GE 6; Tr. 28, 33, 52-57, 62, 67)
Despite his multiple claims that the mortgage and HELOC have been paid in full,
at the hearing, Applicant admitted that he has not paid $320,000 plus interest to Bank B,
nor has he paid $70,000 plus interest to Bank C. His claims that he paid both accounts in
full are based upon Bank B and Bank C failing to provide the validation that he requested.
Applicant’s  wife  has  been  continuously  employed  throughout  their  dispute  with  the
lenders. (Tr. 28, 52, 63)
Applicant  owes  the Internal  Revenue  Service  approximately  $3,500 for tax  year
2017, and at the time of the hearing he did not have a payment arrangement. Additionally,
he owes approximately $1,000 in property taxes for his house. (Tr. 57-59)
Applicant works with charity organizations. (Tr. 25) His work has been recognized
with numerous certificates of appreciation, and he was awarded an employee of the year
award from his current employer. He is proud that he has contributed to creating secure
network systems for the government. (Tr. 25-26)
