Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  March  2018.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree,  which  was
awarded in 2010. He is single without children.1
Applicant  was  unemployed  for  about  six  months  after  he  graduated  college,  for
several  months  in  2014,  and  for  about  three  weeks  in  2016.  He  also  had  periods  of
underemployment wherein he was unable to find full-time work. He was unable to pay
all his bills, and a number of debts became delinquent.2
The SOR alleges three delinquent bank or credit union debts totaling $21,750; a
$145 debt to a cable company; a $288 medical debt; and three defaulted student loans.
However, the $570 defaulted student loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f is a duplicate of one of
the other two defaulted student loans. The total of those two loans is $4,952. The non-
duplicate allegations are established through credit reports and Applicant’s admissions.
Applicant contracted with a credit-counseling company in about August 2018. He
enrolled  four  debts  in  the  company’s  debt-management  program  (DMP),  including  the
debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.c  ($4,810),  1.d  ($288),  and  1.e  ($145).  The  fourth  debt  of
$1,451  is  to  his  state,  which  Applicant  said  was  for  overpaid  unemployment
compensation.  Applicant  testified  that  he  was  paying  $235  a  month  to  the  DMP.  The
DMP  documentation  calls  for  Applicant  to  pay  $169  per  month,  which  the  company
disburses  to  the  four  creditors,  minus  a  $22  maintenance  fee.  Applicant  paid  an  initial
fee  of  $75  in  September  2018.  He  made  $169  payments  in  September  and  October
2018;  followed  by  $57  payments  in  November  2018,  December  2018,  and  January
2019; and a $46 payment in February 2019.3
Applicant  paid  $256  on  January  29,  2019,  outside  the  DMP,  to  resolve  the
remainder owed on the $288 medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d.4
Applicant  thought  that  he  was  paying  $120  per  month  through  the  DMP  toward
the $8,476 delinquent credit card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. He was informed that the
debt was not one of the four debts in the DMP. He then stated that the debt was being
paid outside the DMP to a collection company on behalf of the creditor, and later that he
was  unsure  whether  the  debt  was  being  paid.  He  did  not  provide  any  supporting
documentation or additional information about the status of the debt.5

Applicant  and  the  creditor  for  the  $8,464  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  agreed  to
settle the debt for $2,539. Applicant agreed to pay $105 per month until July 2020. He
established  through  documentation  that  he  made  $105  payments  in  August  2018,
November 2018, and December 2018.6
The defaulted student loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g ($3,555) and 1.e ($1,397) are
paid. Applicant provided documentation of payments of $2,237 in March 2017; $2,138 in
March 2018; and $815 in August 2018.7
Applicant stated that his current finances are better since he has a stable job with
a good salary. He credibly stated that he intends to pay his debts.8
