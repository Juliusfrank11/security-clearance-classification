In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations.  The
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant’s  father,  mother,  two  brothers,  two  sisters,  and  his
brother-in-law are citizens and residents of Iraq. It further alleged that one brother (B1)
works for the Ministry of Defense, Military Intelligence Branch. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c).
Applicant is 41 years old. He was born in Iraq in 1977. He remained there until
January 2007 when he resided in Damascus, Syria, with his father. He was unemployed
when he was living in Syria. He remained there until February 2008, when he returned
to  Iraq.  He  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  2010  through  an  international  refugee
program.  He  is  seeking  a  clearance  for  a  translator  position  with  a  federal  contractor.
From  2010  to  the  present,  he  has  worked  for  a  private  employer.  He  is  single,  never
married, with no children. He owns a home in the United States, but no further details

4 Items 3-5.
In 2014 and 2016, Applicant visited Iraq for approximately 30 days per visit. He
traveled  to  Iraq  to  see  his  family.  While  he  was  in  Iraq  in  2016,  he  renewed  his  Iraqi
passport. He possesses current Iraqi and U.S. passports. From July to November 2004,
Applicant was employed as a translator/linguist for a U.S. contractor in Iraq. He quit the
position  because  he  felt  it  was  too  dangerous.  In  2004,  His  brother-in-law  was  killed
working for the same contractor.5

Applicant’s mother’s status remained unresolved, his father moved back to Iraq where

Iraq
The  U.S.  State  Department  warns  U.S.  citizens  against  travel  to  Iraq  as
conditions  within  the  country  remain  dangerous.  The  U.S.  Embassy  warns  that  U.S.
citizens are at high risk for kidnapping and violence and to avoid all but essential travel
to  Iraq.  The  U.S.  government  considers  the  potential  threat  to  U.S.  government
personnel  in  Iraq  to  be  serious  enough  to  require  them  to  live  and  work  under  strict
security  guidelines.  The  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Levant  (ISIL)  remained  the  greatest
terrorist threat globally, maintaining a formidable force in Iraq and Syria.
