The  SOR  identified  twelve  delinquent  debts  totaling  in  excess  of  $42,000.
Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR, except 1.a.  Credit reports
of the Applicant dated June 24, 2017; and October 29, 2018, reflect that the debts are
still owing.  (Government Exhibits 5 and 6.)
Applicant  admits  that  over  the  years  he  has  lived  beyond  his  means.    He  has
spent  money  he  really  could  not  afford,  on  his  hobby,  which  is  electronics.    He
explained that he enjoys buying computer parts in order to prepare to do graphic design
and web design.  Until July 2015, he was able to pay his bills.  In July 2015, he was laid
off from a previous job, and he did not find work for about three to four months.  (Tr. p.
47.)    During  this  period,  his  credit  cards  were  his  only  source  of  income  and  he
continued to use them as though his income had not been effected.
Applicant  started  working  for  his  current  employer  in  2017.    He  states  that  he
could not find anyone affordable to help him with his finances until recently.  In October
2018,  Applicant  hired  a  credit  counselor  to  help  him  resolve  his  debt.    (Applicantâ€™s
Exhibit  A.)    However,  during  his  interview  with  an  investigator  in  July  2017,  when  his
delinquent debts were brought to his attention, Applicant stated that he was planning to
pay  his  debts  in  full  and/or  would  be  setting  up  payments  plans  for  his  delinquent
accounts by the end of 2018.  (Tr. p. 33, and Government Exhibit 2.)

Applicant admits  that he  got  into this financial  situation  because  he  was  spending
beyond his means.  He still has a lot of responsibilities that include helping his parents
pay the rent and taking care of other expenses, besides his own bills.  At the end of the
month  he  is left  with  a  very  small  amount  of  money  that  he  has  to  manage  to  use for
gas, food and other things.  (Tr. p. 46.)  Applicant states that he is currently trying to find
a  better  paying  job.    He  wants  a  stable  income  where  he  can  use  a  portion  of  that
income to pay his bills and place the rest in savings.  (Tr. p. 50.)
