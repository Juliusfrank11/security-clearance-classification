In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e, but he
listed these debts had been charged off and he was no longer responsible. He denied the
debts in ¶¶ 1.a-1.c, and 1.f-1.h. He admitted the single SOR allegation under Guideline B
(¶ 2.a). He did not provide any supporting documentation at the hearing, or during the 30-
day period the record was held open. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant  is  61  years  old  and  he  is  seeking  employment  as  a  truck  driver  for  a
government contractor. He obtained his high school diploma in 1975. Between 1978 and
2005,  Applicant  was  married  on  five  separate  occasions,  and  one  woman  he  married
twice. He does not have any children, and he is currently married to a U.S. naturalized
citizen  from  Thailand.  His  wife  is  a  truck  driver  for  a  government  contractor  and  she
currently  possess  a  DOD  security  clearance.  Applicant  has  been  her  partner  on
unclassified  cargo  assignments.  They  operate  as  owner  operators  of  their  personally
owned truck. They are leased through a limited liability company, where his wife is the
owner. He is not currently employed and has no source of income. His wife makes about
$25,000 annually and she financially supports Applicant. (Tr. 8, 39-40, 43-47, 49; GE 1,
GE 2)
Financial Considerations
The amount of debt alleged in the SOR is approximately $38,000. Applicant listed
in his SOR response and testified at the hearing that after his accounts were charged off,
he  may  be  morally  responsible  for  the  charged-off  debt,  but  he  is  no  longer  legally
responsible for resolving the debt. Applicant claimed he received this legal advice from
his attorney. (Tr. 15-16)
The SOR alleges eight delinquent debts, and the record establishes the status of
Applicant’s accounts as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a charged-off debt for $16,910. Applicant opened the account
to pay for his back and neck surgeries in 2014. He made payments totaling approximately
$1,000 in 2014. He claimed that he obtained a letter from his medical insurance, Medicaid,
informing him that his medical account had been paid in full. The creditor disagreed that
his  medical  insurance  fully  paid  the  cost  of  his  medical  procedures.  Applicant  has  not
made any payments on this account since 2014, and since it has been charged off as a
bad debt, he stated he is no longer legally responsible for this account. The July 2019
credit report showed this account as charged off. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 16-22, 54-
55, 61; GE 5)
SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  1.d,  and  1.e  allege  three  credit  card  accounts  charged  off  as  bad
debts in the total amount of $10,779. Applicant testified that he recognized these accounts
as his, but since they have been charged off, he is no longer legally responsible for these
outstanding credit card accounts. The July 2019 credit report verified that these accounts
were charged off. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 22-25, 27-29; GE 5)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a credit card debt referred for collection in the total amount of
$5,580. Applicant testified that he is uncertain if this is his debt. He received letters from
the collection agency, but he has never made any inquiries with the creditor to determine
whether this is his account. All of the letters he received from the collection agency were
placed in the trash. During his November 2017 background interview, Applicant admitted
this credit card account. The July 2019 credit report showed this outstanding account as
disputed by the consumer. Applicant does not intend to pay or resolve this debt. (Tr. 25-
27, 64; GE 2, GE 5)
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  a  medical  debt  referred  for  collection  in  the  total  amount  of
$3,000. Applicant denied this allegation in his SOR response. At the hearing, he stated
that he does not know what this account pertains to, so he has not paid it or made any
inquiries with the creditor. He was asked about this debt and the other SOR delinquent
obligations during his November 2017 background interview. Again, he knew they were
a  concern  to  the  government  in  January  2019  when  the  delinquent  accounts  were
included in the SOR. Yet by June 2019, he has still not investigated them. Obviously, he
does  not  care  about  his  finances  and  is a  poor  security  risk.  The  October  2016  credit
report in evidence documented the debt, and this debt is unresolved. (Tr. 29-30, 55; GE
3)
SOR ¶¶ 1.g, and 1.h allege medical debts referred for collection in the total amount
of $725. Applicant denied these allegations in his SOR response  because he believed
these debts were paid in full for $1,100. The October 2016 credit report documented the
delinquent debts. He testified that he had a cancelled check showing his payment in full.
Applicant failed to provide supporting documentation during the 30-day period the record
was held open. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 30-31, 55, 57-58; GE 3)
During his November 2017 background interview, Applicant had about $50,000 in
savings. At the hearing he stated that he currently had about $16,000 in savings. He will
not use this money to pay off delinquent debts. He is saving this money for the time when
he begins to draw Social Security benefits, and he will use the money to supplement his
income.  He  and  his  wife  are  current  on  their  monthly  expenses,  and  they  have  not
developed  any  new  delinquent  debt.  Applicant  has  not  participated  in  any  financial
counseling. (Tr. 8, 31-32, 63; GE 2)
Foreign Influence
SOR  ¶  2.a  alleges  that  Applicant’s  parents-in-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Thailand, and he provides them  with monthly financial support.  Applicant admitted this
allegation in the SOR response. His spouse speaks with her parents on the telephone
three to four times a week. Appellant and his wife provide them with approximately $100-
$200 monthly financial support. Appellant does not communicate with his in-laws due to
their language barrier. His mother-in-law is a homemaker, and his father-in-law is a retired
bus driver. Applicant’s in-laws do not have any affiliation with the Government of Thailand.
