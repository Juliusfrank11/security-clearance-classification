Applicant  admitted  the  two  allegations  of  the  SOR,  ¶¶  1.a.,  and  1.b.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  53-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  pages  5
and  10.)  He  has  been  employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  August  of  2014.
(AppX  1  at  page 10.)  He  is married,  and has  three adult  children.  (GX  1  at  pages  21,
and  24~25.)  Applicant  attributes  his  alleged  financial  difficulties  to  the  crash  of  the
housing  market  in  2008,  and  to  a  year  of  unemployment  prior  to  his  present
employment. (TR at page 25 line 25 to page 29 at line 13, and GX 1 at page 11.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a Applicant admits a past-due debt for landscaping to Creditor A in the amount
of about $33,000. (TR at page 62 line 23 to page 64 line 12.) He has settled this debt for
$15,000,  and  has  made  the  first  of  three  $5,000  payments  as  evidenced  by
documentation from Creditor A. (AppX H.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.b. Applicant admits a past-due debt as the result of a foreclosure to Creditor B.
(TR  at  66  line  3  to  page  68  line  12.) This  debt  was  satisfied  more  than  six  years  ago
through the foreclosure, as evidenced by the Government’s July 2012 credit report. (GX
4 at page 4.)  This allegation is found for Applicant.
Applicant’s  wife  corroborated  his  testimony,  and  his  father  and  brother  testified
as to Applicant’s good character. (TR at page 40 line 15 to page 49 line 6, at page 78
line 6 to page 80 line 19, and at page 82 line 3 to page 84 line 5.)
