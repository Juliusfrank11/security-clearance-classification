Applicant admitted failing to timely file his 2011-2013 Federal income tax returns,
and  his  2009,  2011,  and  2012  state  income  tax  returns,  and  accumulating  almost
$10,000  delinquent  debt  (SOR  1.a-1.d);  he  claimed  to  have  brought  his  delinquent
mortgage  current  (SOR  1.e).  He  is  a  61-year-old  flight  mechanic  employed  by  a  U.S.
defense  contractor  since  August  2003.  He  seeks  to  renew  a  security  clearance  first
issued in June 2000, and reissued in April 2004 (Item 2).
Applicant disclosed his failure to file his 2010-2013 Federal income tax returns on
his March 2016 clearance application (Item 2), and discussed those returns, as well as
his  2014-2015  returns,  and  eight  delinquent  debts  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  during  his
August  2017  interview  with  a  Government  investigator  (Item  3),  based  on  his  June
2016 credit report (Item 7). He attributed his failure to file his Federal income tax returns
to having to care for his ill mother. His Answer to the SOR (Answer)  also recounts six
significant surgeries—most work related—between January 2011 and July 2018. Each
of these surgeries incurred significant, largely unpaid, time off from work.
Applicant’s  29  October  2018  response  to  DOHA  interrogatories  (Item  4)  stated
that he had now filed his 2009-2012 state and Federal income tax returns He provided
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) account transcripts for 2009-2017, but has not provided
any state documentation. His account transcripts showed that his 2009-2010 tax returns
were timely filed, his 2011-2012 returns were each filed three years late, his 2013 return
had not been filed as of February 2017, and his 2014-2017 returns were filed late, albeit
within  periods  ranging  from  two  weeks  to  two  months  after  they  were  due.  Several  of
these returns resulted in refunds which were seized to satisfy taxes due for earlier tax
years.
Applicant’s February 2019 Answer (Item 1) stated, without corroboration, that he
had  paid  the  past-due  amount  on  his  mortgage  (SOR  1.e)  in  full.  He  provided  no
evidence of a resolution for SOR debt 1.d.
Applicant  documented  no  credit  or  financial  counseling,  and  did  not  submit a
budget.  He  provided  no  work  or  character  references,  or  evidence  of  community
involvement. He submitted no current credit reports which might have corroborated his
claimed payments.
