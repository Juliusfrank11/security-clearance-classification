In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted SOR financial allegations ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d, 1.e,
and 1.g. He denied SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.f, by stating that he was unaware of these
accounts.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After a  thorough
review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is 30 years old. He graduated from high school in 2007, and completed
some college courses between 2007 and 2009, but did not earn a degree. He has never
been married, but has a son, four years old.
Applicant’s employment history shows that he was unemployed between August
2007  and  March  2010.  He  worked  for  a  federal  contractor  between  March  2010  and
September 2013.  He was  unemployed  between October 2013  and  October 2014, and
employed  between  October  2014  and  October  2015.  A  federal  contractor  hired
Applicant as a mail truck driver in October 2015, and is sponsoring his clearance. This
is Applicant’s first SCA.
In  response  to  Section  26  (Financial  Record)  of  his  2015  SCA,  Applicant
disclosed  he  had  financial  problems  caused  by  periods  of  employment  and  lack  of
financial  backing.  He  disclosed  delinquent  student  loans  and  a  delinquent  television
services  account.  He promised  to  establish payment arrangements  with  both  creditors
as soon as possible.
During  his  2017  interview  with  a  government  investigator,  Applicant  was
questioned  about  most  of  the  accounts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  He  explained  that
unemployment and low earnings prevented him from paying his debts. He volunteered
that he had a judgment filed against him and his bank account was levied. He failed to
file his 2013 income tax returns and had to file them before filing income tax returns for
2015 and 2016. He claimed he immediately paid whatever taxes he owed.
Concerning  his  student  loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.e),  Applicant  claimed  he  had
consolidated  his  student  loans,  established  a  payment  plan,  and  was  making  his
payments. He stated that he acquired the account alleged in  SOR ¶ 1.b in 2013, when
he was unemployed and could not make the payments. He claimed that he established
a payment agreement with the creditor and paid the account in 2014. Applicant claimed
the medical account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c was paid by his insurance company. SOR ¶
1.g  alleges  the  same  delinquent  television  services  account  Applicant  disclosed  in  his
2015  SCA,  which  is  in  collection  by  a  collection  agency.  Applicant  failed  to  present
documentary evidence to support any of the above claims.
In his responses to the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility interrogatories,
dated  June  27,  2018,  Applicant  stated  that  he  had  failed  to  obtain  the  IRS  account
transcripts that he was asked to provide for tax years 2013 through 2017, and failed to
provide  documentation  showing  the  he  had  filed  his  state  income  tax  returns  for  tax
years  2013  through  2017.  Applicant  claimed  that  he  had  filed  his  federal  and  state
income tax returns for the years in question. He failed to present documentary evidence
to  substantiate  his  claims.  Concerning  the  delinquent  accounts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a
through 1.g, Applicant answered that he had not paid or made payment arrangements
regarding his delinquent accounts.
Applicant  lives  at  home  with  his  parents.  As  of  his  June  2018  answer  to
interrogatories, his gross monthly income was $2,692. After paying his deductions and
monthly expenses (including $980 in car expenses and $600 child support obligation),
Applicant has an $11 monthly net remainder. He did not present evidence to show that
he has a working budget or that he has participated in financial counseling.
Applicant  presented  no  documentary  evidence  of  any  contacts  with  creditors,
payments made, or payment agreements established concerning any of the SOR debts.
He promised to address the SOR debts sometime in the near future.
