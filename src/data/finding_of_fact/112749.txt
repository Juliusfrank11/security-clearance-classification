In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  two  of  the  factual  allegations
pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse of the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.b. and 1.c.);
and two of the factual allegations pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR ¶¶ 2.d. and 2.f.).
He  denied  the  remaining  allegations  as  well  as  the  principal  allegation  pertaining  to
personal  conduct  (SOR  ¶  3.b.).  Applicant’s  admissions  are  incorporated  herein  as
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and
upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  a  mechanic  with  his  current  employer  since  February  2014.  A  2000  high  school
graduate, Applicant attended a technical institute and received a heating, ventilation, and
air conditioning (HVAC) certification in 2001. He has never served with the U.S. military.
He  was  granted  an  interim  security  clearance  at  some  unspecified  point  between
September 2016 and February 2018.1 Applicant has never been married, but he has six
children, born in 2002, 2004, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2016.
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
(SOR  ¶  1.a.):  Applicant  was  a  substance  abuser  whose  primary  substance  of
choice was marijuana. He started using and purchasing marijuana in 1997, when he was
approximately  15  years  old.  He  started  smoking  marijuana  at  least  weekly,  and  that

frequency continued until approximately 2012 or 2013. Thereafter, until December 2017,
he  purportedly  reduced  his  marijuana  use  to  one  or  two  times  per  year.  During  his
interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in
February 19, 2018, Applicant admitted that his most recent use of marijuana occurred two
weeks before he was interviewed.2 However, he changed his story in his response to the
interrogatories when he stated that his last and most recent use of marijuana occurred in
December 2017.3 Regardless of the most recent date, Applicant’s last use was well after
he  submitted  his  2016  e-QIP.  Applicant  indicated  that  marijuana  made  him  calm  and
enabled him to relax. While he did not consider himself to be dependent upon marijuana,
as  of  his  OPM  interview,  he  was  unable  to  quit  altogether.  Applicant  never  grew
marijuana, and he generally purchased it “off the streets,” as he does not have a supplier.
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): In November 2015, while in a foreign country, Applicant was arrested
by the local police for suspected violations of the Cannabis Control Act and the nation’s
customs law. A female friend whom Applicant had met during a temporary assignment in
the  United  States  shipped  him  a  package  containing  marijuana  cookies.  Applicant
claimed that he was unaware that the package had been shipped to him, that he never
expected  it,  and  that  he  never  received  it.  The  package  was  intercepted  by  customs
authorities. On November 23, 2015, pursuant to a search warrant, the police searched
his  hotel  room  and  seized  a  glass  pipe  containing  traces  of  marijuana.  Applicant  was
arrested and taken to the local precinct where he was held for 21 days, after which the
local prosecutor declined to prosecute Applicant. He was released.4
Applicant  stated  that  he  decided  to  stop  using  marijuana  due  to  new  religious
beliefs; that he no longer associates with persons using illegal substances; and that he
no  longer  frequents  locations  where  drugs  are  being  used.  In  his  responses  to  the
interrogatories,  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  had  never  participated  in  a  drug  or
alcohol  treatment  rehabilitation  program,  or  received  any  counseling.  Instead,  he
practices self-control and prays. However, in his response to the FORM, he stated that
he planned to attend his first Narcotics Anonymous meeting on April 1, 2019.5
In  addition  to  marijuana,  Applicant  also  had  a  relationship  with  cocaine,  not  by
using it, but rather by selling it as a sideline activity to raise extra cash. He contended that
he last did so about seven years before his 2018 OPM interview, which would make his
most recent sale as taking place in approximately 2011.
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): On or about July 2, 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with
possession of a firearm while in possession of drugs, a felony; and manufacturing, sales,
and possession of a controlled substance, also a felony. The controlled substance was

approximately one gram of cocaine. The charges were dismissed in September 2003.6
Applicant contended that the charges were dismissed because the search of his vehicle
was “illegal.”7
Criminal Conduct
In  addition  to  the  criminal conduct  associated  with  Applicant’s  drug  involvement
and substance misuse, described above, Applicant has a history of arrests and charges
for a variety of activities:
(SOR ¶ 2.b.): On May 24, 2010, he was charged with contempt of court for failure
to appear, a misdemeanor. On December 9, 2011, he was found guilty of the charge, and
he was ordered to pay restitution;8
(SOR ¶ 2.c.): On November 24, 2010, he was charged with contempt of court. No
disposition was recorded;9
(SOR ¶ 2.d.): On October 28, 2011, after being in a bar fight protecting the mother
of  one  of  his  children  from  an  assault,  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  malicious
wounding, a felony. He and the other individual involved remained in jail overnight. At the
subsequent court hearing in February 2012, no witnesses appeared, and the charge was
nolle prossed;10
(SOR  ¶  2.e.):  On  May  1,  2014,  he  was  charged  with  contempt  of  court.  In
September 2014, the charge was dismissed;11 and
(SOR ¶ 2.f.): On June 24, 2016, he was arrested and charged with assault and
battery on a family member, a misdemeanor, after he slapped his daughter in the face,
busting her lip. The child’s mother called the police. Applicant appeared in the juvenile
and domestic relations court in July 2017, and the court ordered a two-year deferment
(under  advisement)  with  eventual  and  dismissal,  providing  Applicant  completes  a
parenting class and an anger management course.12 Thus, he remains in this status until
July  2019.  As  of  February  19,  2018,  Applicant  claimed  that  he  had  completed  the

parenting  class  at  a  local  church,  one  evening  per  week  for  six  weeks,  but  he
acknowledged  that  he  had  not  yet  taken  the  anger  management  course,  and  such  a
course  was  not  yet  scheduled.13  As  of  the  closing  of  the  record,  Applicant  had  not
submitted any evidence that he had completed the anger management course, that the
charges had been dismissed, or that he remains “under advisement.”
Personal Conduct
(SOR ¶ 3.a.): This allegation cross-references the SOR allegations associated
with Applicant’s drug involvement and substance misuse, and criminal conduct.
(SOR ¶ 3.b.):  On September 9, 2016, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he
responded to certain questions pertaining to his illegal use of drugs or drug activity found
in  Section  23.  The  most  significant  question,  and  the  one  alleged  in  the  SOR,  was
essentially  as follows: In the  last  seven  (7) years have  you  illegally  used  any  drugs  or
controlled substances? Use of a drug or controlled substance includes injecting, snorting,
inhaling, swallowing, experimenting with or otherwise consuming any drug or controlled
substance. Two other questions, while not alleged in the SOR,14 were also asked: In the
last  seven  (7)  years  have  you  been  involved  in  the  illegal  purchase,  manufacture,
cultivation,  trafficking,  production,  transfer,  shipping,  receiving,  handling  or  sale  of  any
drug  or  controlled  substance?;  and  Have  you  ever  illegally  used  or  otherwise  been
involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance other
than previously listed? Applicant answered “no” to the combined questions.15 He omitted
the  November  2015  violation  of  the foreign Cannabis Control Act and  customs  law for
which he was in jail for 21 days; his admitted use of marijuana that continued until after
the e-QIP was completed; his purchases of marijuana; and the fact that he held an interim
security clearance at some unspecified point between September 2016 (when he was still
using marijuana) and February 2018. He certified that his responses to those questions
were “true, complete, and correct” to the best of his knowledge and belief, but, because
of his omissions, the responses to those questions were, in fact, false.
Other than simply denying that he had deliberately falsified material facts in his e-
QIP, Applicant has not offered any explanations for the omissions. He did not claim, for

14 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal
Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to
evaluate  an  applicant's  evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to  consider
whether  an  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful  rehabilitation;  (d)  to  decide  whether  a  particular
provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis
under Directive § 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No.
02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also

Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant’s unlisted and unalleged
drug activity will be considered only for the five purposes listed above.

substance misuse.
