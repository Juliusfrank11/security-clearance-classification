In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  admitted  she  owed  $8,000  in  Federal
income tax for tax year 2009, and admitted to the delinquency on her mortgage payment,
but asserted there had been a loan modification. She asserted she had paid four of the
delinquent medical obligations and that three of the listed debts were duplications. She
admitted owing the additional 28 delinquent medical debts. After a thorough review of the
pleadings and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 54-year-old electrical engineer, who has worked for her employer
since  September  2017.  (Item  1)  She  has  never  married  or  served  in  the  military.  In
December  1996,  she  obtained  her  bachelor’s  degree,  and  in  June  2010,  obtained  her
master’s degree. (Ex. 2)
On  Applicant’s  September  2017  Electronic  Questionnaires  for  Investigations
Processing (e-QIP) she listed a $20,500 second mortgage taken out for a new roof on
her home on which she planned to negotiate a repayment plan whereby she would pay
$200 monthly. (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Ex. 3) She listed $100,000 past due on her primary mortgage
and  planned  to  pay  $1,000  monthly  once  a  modification  of  the  mortgage  loan  was
reached. (Ex. 2) She listed $15,000 owned on medical debts and that she was negotiating
a  settlement  estimating  her  monthly  payments  would  be  $100.  She  also  listed  a  $500
telephone bill and $500 cable bill on her e-QIP. These two debts are not listed as debts
of concern on her SOR. (Ex. 2) On her e-QIP, she explained her financial problems were
due  to  loss  of  income,  underemployment,  and  medical  expenses.  (Ex.  2)  During  her
March  27,  2018  enhanced  subject  interview,  she  was  questioned  about  all  of  her
delinquent  financial  obligations  and  specifically  about  all  of  the  SOR  delinquent
obligations. (Ex. 3)
In the FORM, Department Counsel stated:
Applicant appears to have been actively engaged in attempting to resolve
her debt through payments in full, negotiations with creditors and arranging
payment plans. She has a desire to solve her financial issues, but there is
no  documentation  substantiating  any  efforts.  Additional  documentation
added to this FORM by the Applicant would be beneficial for mitigation and
review by the administrative judge.
No  response  to  the  FORM  was  received,  which,  of  course,  means  there  is  no
documentation  of  record  supporting  her  assertions  of  payment,  negotiating  with  her
creditors, or repayment plans received.
In  Applicant’s  September  2018  SOR  Response,  she  says  she  was  unemployed
from June 2009 through June 2011 and had incurred a Federal tax debt for 2009. (Ex. 1)
She admitted the tax debt was unpaid, and stated an intention to “start making payments
beginning  next  year.”  (Ex.  1)  Between  May  2014  and  September  2017,  she  was
underemployed at minimum wage and not working in her profession as an engineer. (Ex.
1)
In  2010,  due  to  Applicant’s  unemployment,  her  home  went  into  foreclosure
proceedings. Her monthly mortgage obligation was $998. She was 36 months behind on
her mortgage payments at the time of the foreclosure. (Ex. 3) From June 2011 through
June 2013, she was working full time as an electrical engineer. However, the mortgage
company  would  not  accept  payments  from  her  until  the  matter  of  her  mortgage
delinquency was heard in court. She fails to explain why she was not setting aside her
monthly mortgage in a separate account while she was full-time employed so she could
apply the money to her mortgage once a court ruling was made. As of July 2017, she
owed $101,374 on the home and was $64,641 past due on her payments. (Ex. 3)
In September 2017, the mortgage company was ordered to modify Applicant’s loan
and  in  July  2018,  a  modification  was  made.  Applicant  asserts  she  began  making
payments in August 2018. The scheduled monthly mortgage payments are $1,106. (Ex.
3) She provided no documentation supporting her assertion of payments.
Applicant incurred an $8,000 federal tax debt (SOR 1. a) when she withdrew funds
from her 401(k) retirement plan in 2009. She used the funds to prevent foreclosure on her
home. (Ex. 3) Initially her tax liability was $15,000, but the amount was reduced to $8,000
when a tax refund was intercepted and applied to the tax debt. (Ex. 3) She asserted she
worked with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concerning the debt, and she receives a
letter every six months informing her of the balance owed. (Ex. 3)
The SOR alleges 35 delinquent medical debts, totaling $12,146. The debts include
13 debts of less than $100 each, 12 debts of between $100 and $200 each, 7 debts of
more  than  $200  each,  and  3  debts  that  are  duplication  of  other  debts.  In  July  2015,
Applicant had a knee replacement. Her medical health insurance had a high deductible
resulting in her insurance paying a smaller amount of her medical expenses. (Ex. 1) She
made her co-payments. In May 2016, she fell and broke her knee cap. Her high deductible
again made her insurance reimbursement low. She said she had to negotiate a settlement
for her medical expenses incurred in 2015 and 2016.
In  September  2017,  Applicant  returned  to  full-time  employment  as  an  electrical
engineer. At the time of her March 2018 enhanced subject interview, she asserted with
her current employment she will be able to repay her delinquent financial obligations. (Ex.
3) She expressed an intention to have all of her medical debts paid within two years. (Ex.
3) She asserts since returning to full-time employment, she is paying a bill a month. She
asserted when she responded to the SOR she had paid the $858 medical bill (SOR 1.s,
SOR 1.t is a duplicate debt), the $831 medical debt (SOR 1.u), the $531 medical bill (SOR
1.v),  and  the  $150  collection  debt  (SOR  1.z)  in  August  2018  (Ex.  1)  She  provided  no
documentation supporting her assertions of payment of these debts.
