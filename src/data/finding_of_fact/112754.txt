Applicant  is  a  34-year-old  interpreter-translator  sponsored  for  a  security
clearance by a defense contractor. He was employed by a federal contractor previously
as an interpreter for U.S. armed forces, from May 2011 to September 2012, at forward
operating  bases  in  Afghanistan.  He  is  a  dual  citizen  of  the  United  States  and
Afghanistan and he is fluent in the languages spoken by Afghans. This is precisely why
the United States (U.S.) contractor sought Applicant out and hired him – for his esoteric
language skills. He was born in Afghanistan and graduated from high school in Kabul in
1998. Applicant came to the U.S. in 2006 and he was naturalized in 2016. He has been
employed as an interpreter for U.S. interests in Afghanistan since September 2017 and
he plans to live and work in Afghanistan pending the grant of his security clearance.
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  also  known
as a security clearance application (SCA) on September 21, 2017.2 Applicant disclosed
that he was married in 2006 and divorced in 2010. He was employed previously as an
Uber  driver,  Lyft  driver,  or  as  a  security  guard,  at  various  times  since  he  entered  the
U.S.  (Item  3)  Applicant  was  unemployed  from  November  to  December  2014;  from
October 2012 to August 2013; and November 2009 to March 2010. Although he served

Security Positions dated September 21, 2017 (Item 3).
2 Item 3.
as  a  linguist  for  U.S.  armed  forces  in  2011-  2012,  Applicant  responded  negatively  to
questions  in  section  25  (Investigations  and  Clearance  Record)  of  his  SCA  asking
whether  the  U.S.  or  any  foreign  government  previously  granted  him  a  security
clearance.
Applicant  was  married  in  2006  and  divorced  in  2010.  He  has  no  children.
Applicant’s mother and most of his siblings are citizens of Afghanistan. His mother and
one brother  reside  in Afghanistan. Applicant  has contact  with  his mother  by  telephone
once every other day. She is 56 years old, lives with Applicant’s brother, and she is not
employed  outside  her  home.  She  has  never  been  affiliated  with  the  Afghanistan
government,  or  any  other  foreign  government.  His  mother  knows  about  Applicant’s
translator  services,  but  does  not  tell  others  that  he  is  working  in  support  of  U.S.
concerns,  out  of  fear  for  his  safety.  Applicant  sends  his  mother  $500  to  $700  dollars
each month to help with her rent and groceries. He sent her $15,000 between 2009 and
2017.  Applicant  has  no  sympathy,  preference  for,  or  alliance  with  foreign  nationals
except his mother.
