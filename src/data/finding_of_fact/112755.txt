In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted (by using the term “I accept”) all of
the factual allegations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.m.). Attached to her Answer to
the  SOR  were  a  number  of  documents  and  comments  in  support  of  her  individual
responses.  Applicant’s  admissions,  comments,  and  the  information  in  the  attachments
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the
evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due  consideration  of  same,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  30-year-old  employee  of  a  U.S.  Naval  hospital  located  overseas.
She  has  been  serving  as  a  medical  assistant  with  her  current  employer  since  August
2016, and previously served as a volunteer in the same facility from January 2016 until
August 2016. Before that, she was a certified nursing assistant for a domestic healthcare
provider  for  several  years  commencing  in  2006.  A  2006  high  school  graduate,  she
received an associate’s degree as an x-ray medical technician and medical assistant in
2011. Applicant has never served with the U.S. military. She has never held a security
clearance,  and  it  is  unclear  if  she  ever  held  a  position  of  public  trust.  Applicant  was
married in 2008. She has two children, born in 2008 and 2009.
Financial Considerations1
It is unclear when Applicant’s financial difficulties first arose, although a review of
her March 2016 credit report seems to indicate that some accounts became delinquent
as early as 2013. In her e-QIP, Applicant reported that she was employed as a certified
1 General source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can be found in the
following exhibits: Item 6 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated May 1, 2018); Item 5 (Combined Experian,
TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated March 3, 2016); Item 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated July 3,
2018; and Item 2 (Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, dated October 26, 2018).
nursing assistant from June 2006 until at least February 2016,2 but during an interview
with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in May 2018,
she stated that she was unemployed from April 2015 until January 2016 when she was
moving with her family overseas, house-hunting, job-hunting, and unpacking.3 In her e-
QIP,  she  denied  having  any  financial  delinquencies  within  the  past  seven  years,  but
during  her  OPM  interview,  she  acknowledged  and  discussed  a  number  of  delinquent
accounts. With the exception of one credit-card account for which she was an authorized
user,  and  on  which  her  husband  failed  to  make  payments  while  he  was  deployed  to
Afghanistan, Applicant did not identify any factors that were largely beyond her control
that might have resulted in her financial problems.
The  SOR  alleged  13  purportedly  continuing  delinquent  debts,  including  nine
totaling
four  commercial  accounts  or  credit-card  accounts,
student
approximately $52,549 that had been placed for collection, as follows:
loans  and
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., 1.f. through 1.j., and 1.m.): These are student loans with
unpaid balances of $9,635; $7,805; $5,499; $4,491; $4,358; $4,201; $2,208; $1,981; and
$460 that were placed for collection as reflected in her July 2018 credit report. However,
Applicant contends that there are only three student loans which are mentioned multiple
times, each time with a different balance. The account numbers in the 2016 credit report
are  all  different  20-digit  numbers,  but  the  three  different  account  numbers  (or  partial
account numbers) in the 2018 credit report are all 4-digit numbers, none of which have
any commonality with the longer numbers. Applicant acknowledged that her wages were
being garnished to pay her student loans, and every few months her entire paycheck is
taken.4  Attached  to her  October 2018  Answer to the  SOR, as  well  as  her March  2019
Response  to  the  FORM,  Applicant  submitted  documentation  reflecting  that  the  U.S.
Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) was offsetting her
wages under the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) to the U.S. Department of Education.5
The  earliest  wage  offset  occurred  in  January  2017  –  18  months  before  the  SOR  was
issued  –  with  a  payment  of  $1,178.6  Thereafter,  there  are  a  number  of  vouchers  and
statements  reflecting  continuing  payments  through  March  2019,  totaling  well  over
$14,000.7  The  accounts,  regardless  of  the  actual  number,  are  in  the  process  of  being
resolved.

5 The TOP is a centralized offset program, administered by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service's Debt
Management Services (DMS), to collect delinquent debts owed to federal agencies and states (including
past-due  child  support),  in  accordance  with  26  U.S.C.  §  6402(d)  (collection  of  debts  owed  to  federal
agencies), 31 U.S.C. § 3720A (reduction of tax refund by amount of the debts), and other applicable laws.

(SOR ¶ 1.c.): This is a joint installment-sales contract with an unpaid balance of
$5,717 that was placed for collection after the last payment was made in 2013, and the
creditor  was  unable  to  locate  the  consumer.  In  August  2018,  the  creditor  accepted
Applicant’s  proposed  payment  plan  under  which  she  agreed  to  start  making  monthly
payments  of  $200,  commencing  on  September  1,  2018.8  Applicant  contends  she  has
been making the agreed-upon payments and that, as of March 2019, she has a balance
of $4,785.9 She failed to submit any documents such as receipts, cancelled checks, or
bank account registers to confirm that those payments were actually being made. In the
absence  of  such  documentation,  it  is  unclear  if  the  account  is  in  the  process  of  being
resolved.
(SOR  ¶  1.e.):  This  is  a  credit-card  account  in  her  husband’s  name,  for  which
Applicant  is  only  an  authorized  user,10  with  an  unpaid  balance  of  either  $5,023  (as
reflected in the 2016 credit report and in the SOR) or $4,973 (as reflected in the 2018
credit report) that was placed for collection and charged off. Applicant contended that the
creditor agreed to write off the balance, and that forgiven balance was included in her
U.S. Individual Income Tax Return for 2016 as other income.11 Applicant submitted that
income tax return which reflects that a credit card in the amount of $4,974  is listed as
other income. The account has been resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.k.): This is an individual credit-card account issued by a particular bank
with an unpaid balance of $638 that was placed for collection. In her Answer to the SOR,
Applicant  contended  that  the  account  had  been  paid,  and  she  submitted  an  account
statement from the collection agent. However, that account statement refers to an entirely
different account for the following reasons: the account is an account in her husband’s
name, not Applicant’s; the account number differs from the one alleged in the SOR; the
issuing  banks  are  different;  and  the  balances  in  question  are  different.12  As  Applicant
failed to address the account alleged in the SOR, that account has not been resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.l.): This is an individual unspecified type of account issued by a  bank
with an unpaid balance of $533 that was placed for collection and transferred or sold to

10  Being  an  authorized  user  means  an  individual  can  use  someone  else's  credit  card  in  the
individual’s name. That individual can make purchases and use the card as if it were his or her own, but
the individual is not the primary account holder. As an authorized user, the individual may not be legally
responsible to pay the credit card bill or any debts that build up.

another company after Applicant stopped making payments in 2012. Applicant stated in
her Response to the FORM that she was “currently working on getting my debt paid,”13
but she failed to say what steps she had actually taken to resolve the account and did not
submit any documentation regarding same. The account has not been resolved.
Applicant’s joint family adjusted gross income for the tax year 2016 was $47,866.14
Although Applicant referred to a weekly $1,280 paycheck, there is no Personal Financial
Statement to reflect her current net monthly income, monthly expenses, or any remainder
available for discretionary use or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no
evidence of financial counseling. However, while there is a dearth of financial information,
in the absence of any additional delinquent accounts, it appears that Applicant’s financial
situation is now under control.
Work Performance and Character References
Applicant’s  supervisor,  a  Navy  lieutenant  and  the  head  of  the  substance  abuse
rehabilitation  department  of  the  military  hospital  overseas,  characterized  Applicant  as
consistently performing in a professional manner, demonstrating high reliability, and being
proficient with her assigned duties. Applicant has freely discussed her financial problems
with  her.15  A more  senior officer on  the hospital staff  referred  to  Applicant’s  consistent
performance, reliability, and professionalism, with no evidence to question her character
or  reliability.16  The  assistant  station  manager  of  the  American  Red  Cross  identified
Applicant as a volunteer. She has a good attendance record, is reliable, responsible, and
has the enthusiasm and professionalism to be an asset in the healthcare environment.17
