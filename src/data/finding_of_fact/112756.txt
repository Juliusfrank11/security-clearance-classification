In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.g, 1.n, 1.o, and 2.a-
2.e.  He  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.b-1.f,  and  1.h-1.m.  His  admissions  in  his  answer and  at  the
hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 53-year-old waterfront manager employed by a defense contractor
since  July  1,  2016.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from  August  1984  to
September 1999. He was self-employed and owned a mortgage company from October
2002  to  December  2007.  He  sold  the  business  and  was  unemployed  from  December
2007  to  June  2008.  He  worked  in  various  jobs  as  a  consultant  or  project  manager  at
non-government  shipyards from  June  2008  to  October 2012.  He  was  a federal civilian
employee from October 2012 to September 2013. He applied for a security clearance in
November 2012, but his application was denied in December 2013.
After  Applicant’s  application  for  a  security  clearance  was  denied,  he  worked  in
non-government shipyards from October 2013 and as a truck driver from March 2015 to
June  2016.  His  work  history  includes  unemployment  from  December  2007  to  June
2008, April to June 2011, July to October 2012, and January to March 2015.
Applicant married in July 1984 and divorced in March 1996. He remarried in July
2011.  He has four adult  children and  two  adult  stepchildren.  He obtained a  bachelor’s
degree in 2013 and financed it with student loans. (Tr. 21.)
Applicant  filed  a  petition  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  2005  and  received  a
discharge  in  2006.  Approximately  $73,000  in  delinquent  debts  were  discharged.  He

otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
attributed  his  financial  problems  to  legal  fees  totaling  about  $70,000  for  child-custody
litigation  and  travel  to  visit  his  ailing  mother.  Most  of  the  discharged  debts  were  for
business  loans  and  a  credit-card  account.  (GX  12  at  3.)  The  bankruptcy  is  alleged  in
SOR ¶ 1.n.
Between  1996  and  2007,  Applicant  was  charged  with  check  fraud  or  uttering
worthless  checks  about  21  times.  At  a  personal  appearance  in  November  2013,  he
admitted these offenses, which occurred when he floated checks before sufficient funds
were  in  his  account.  (GX  12  at  2.)  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  attributed  these
financial  problems  to  mistakes  while  trying  to  start  and  operate  a  business.  The  bad
checks are alleged in SOR ¶ 1.o.
In addition to the bankruptcy and bad-check offenses, the SOR alleges multiple
failures  to  timely  file  federal  income  tax  returns,  failures  to  timely  pay  federal  income
taxes, delinquent student loans,  and delinquent consumer debts. The federal tax debt,
federal tax liens, delinquent student loans, and delinquent consumer debts are reflected
in  credit  reports  from  December  2012,  October  2016,  February  2018,  and  May  2019.
(GX  3-6.)  The  bad-  check  offenses  are  reflected  in  arrest  records  maintained  by  the
Federal Bureau of Investigation. (GX 7.) The evidence concerning Applicant’s financial
problems is summarized below.
transcripts  submitted  by  Applicant
SOR ¶ 1.a: failure to timely file federal income tax returns for 2000 through
2005, 2007, and 2010 through 2017. Applicant admitted this allegation in his answer to
the  SOR.  Tax
to  DOD  CAF
interrogatories in June 2018 reflect that substitute returns were filed in 2004 by the IRS
for  tax  years  2000  and  2001;  returns  for  2002  through  2005  were  filed  in  2006;  the
return for 2007  was  filed  in  September 2009;  a  return for 2010  was filed  in  November
2011;  a  return  for  2011  was  filed  in  November  2012;  returns  for 2012  and  2013  were
filed  in  April 2018;  and  no  returns  had been filed for  2014  through  2017.  (GX  9  at  27-
65.)
in  response
SOR ¶ 1.b-1.f: failure to timely pay the federal taxes due for 2005, 2006, and
2007;  federal  tax  debt  of  $54,297  for  2006;  federal  tax  debt  of  $3,007  for  2007;
federal  tax  liens  filed  in  September  2007  and  February  2013.  In  his  answer  to  the
SOR, Applicant denied that he failed to pay the taxes due. At the hearing, he admitted
that  he  did  not  make  any  voluntary  payments,  but  he  relied  on  garnishments  and
diversions  of  refunds  to  pay  the  taxes  due.  (Tr.  44-45.)  In  April  2006,  the  IRS
erroneously filed a tax lien for $1.4 million against Applicant. After Applicant challenged
the amount of the lien, the lien was released on February 2007. The IRS filed another
lien  for  $43,264  in  September  2007,  and  a  third  lien  for  $37,202  in  February  2013.  In
February 2018, Applicant hired an attorney to help him resolve his federal tax problems.
He  testified  that  he  could  not  hire  professional  help  earlier  because  he  did  not  have
enough disposable income to pay the lawyer’s $4,000 retainer fee. (Tr. 47-48.) The lien
for  $43,264  was  released  in  August  2018,  and  the  $37,202  lien  was  released  in
February  2019.  In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  provided  evidence  from  his  tax
lawyer  that  he  had  filed  the  delinquent  federal  tax  returns  for  2010  through  2017  in
December 2018, and that the refunds for tax years 2015 through 2017 were sufficient to
pay  the  delinquent  taxes  for  the  earlier  years  and  resolve  the  tax  liens  that  had  been
filed against him.
SOR  ¶  1.g:  delinquent  debt  placed  for  collection  of  $1,161.  In  Applicant’s
answer to the SOR, he presented documentary evidence that the debt had been settled.
SOR  ¶¶ 1.h-1.l:  five  delinquent  student  loans  totaling about $44,000.  In  his
answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denied  these  debts,  stating  that  they  had  not  been
delinquent  since  2017.  The  May  2019  credit  report  reflects  five  delinquent  student
loans,  on  which  the  last  payment  was  made  in  April  2017.  According  to  this  credit
report,  the  scheduled payment for each  loan  was  $703,  but  the  actual payments  were
$99,  $255,  $166,  $66,  and  $115.  The  loans  are  reflected  as  past  due  for  $5,584;
$15,420;  $9,396;  $3,753;  and  $6,504.  (GX  6  at  2-3.)  The  credit  report  contradicts
Applicant’s  documentation  from  the  Department  of  Education  (DOE),  dated  March  3,
2019,  reflecting  monthly  payments  of  $599  from  April  2017  to  July  2017;  a  $418
payment in July 2017; a $514 payment in August 2017; monthly payments of $876 from
March  2018  to  July  2018;  and  monthly  payments  of  $703  from  November  2018  to
March 2019.
SOR ¶ 1.m: delinquent debt for $747. In response to DOD CAF interrogatories,
Applicant  submitted  evidence  that  this  debt  was  settled  for  less  than  the  full  amount.
(GX 9 at 72.)
When Applicant submitted an SCA in November 2012, he disclosed that he had
not  filed  his federal  income  tax  returns  for  2003,  2004,  and  2005.  He  did  not  disclose
that he had failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for 2010 and 2011. (GX 1
at 45-46.) At the hearing, he testified that he did not know why he did not disclose the
past-due tax returns for 2010 and 2011. (Tr. 64.)
During  a  personal  appearance  conducted  by  a  DOHA  administrative  judge  in
November  2013,  he  testified  that  he  had  filed  his  federal  income  tax  returns  for  2000
through  2012.  (GX  13  at  31.)  At  the  hearing,  he  admitted  that  his  answer  during  the
personal appearance was false. (Tr. 66.)
When Applicant submitted his most recent SCA in July 2016, he answered “No”
to the question whether he had failed to file returns or pay federal, state, or other taxes
during the past seven years. (GX 2 at 48.) He did not disclose that he had failed to file
returns or pay taxes for 2010 through 2015. At the hearing, he testified that he did not
know why he answered “No” to this question. (Tr. 64.)
In response to DOD CAF financial interrogatories in March 2018, he stated that
he  had  filed  his  returns  and  paid  the  taxes  for  2006  and  2007.  (GX  8  at  4.)  At  the
hearing, he admitted that these answers were false. (Tr. 68.)
In response to DOD CAF interrogatories, Applicant submitted a personal financial
statement in June 2018 reflecting that he and his wife had a joint net monthly income of
about  $12,623; debt payments  (including  $1,100  in  student  loan  payments) of  $6,363;
mortgage loan payments of $3,403; and a net monthly remainder of about $3,220. (GX
9 at 73.) They reported total wage income of $208,981 for tax year 2017 and $258,948
for tax year 2018. (AX B; AX C.)
Applicant  and  his  wife  own  real  estate  worth  more  than  $1,000,000.  They  own
four  rental  properties,  two  undeveloped  lots,  and  their  primary  residence.  In  2018,
Applicant and his wife purchased three investment properties for $95,000; $45,000; and
about  $70,000.  The  entire  amounts  were  financed  by  the  sellers.  Their  monthly
payments  are  $1,900;  $700;  and  $1,400.  The  properties  are  rented  and  generate
monthly income of about $7,000 per month. Applicant testified that he was comfortable
taking on additional debt because he believes he could sell each of them within 30 days
if he needed to generate income. (Tr. 34-37; 71-72.)
