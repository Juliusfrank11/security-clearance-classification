Applicant is a 44-year-old self-employed consultant for a defense contractor. He
has a bachelor’s degree, which was awarded in 1996. He is married with two children.1
In  about  2004,  Applicant  decided
in  real  estate.  He  bought
condominiums in about 2004 and 2006, before the real estate market crashed. He had
periods of unemployment and underemployment and renters who did not pay their rent.
He was unable to pay the mortgage loans and other debts. Both properties were lost to
foreclosure in about 2014 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c). There is no evidence of any deficiency
balances owed on the properties. An April 2015 credit report lists both mortgage loans
as account closed with a foreclosure and a $0 balance.2

The  April  2015  credit  report  lists  several  debts  that  had  been  paid  or  settled.  It
also lists a credit card that was $4,943 past due with a $5,012 balance (SOR ¶ 1.d). The
credit union obtained a judgment against Applicant in 2010. Applicant paid and satisfied
the judgment in September 2015.3
Applicant  always  worked  as  a  salaried  employee  (W-2)  until  he  started  working
as a consultant and an independent contractor (1099) in 2015. As a salaried employee,
taxes were withheld from his paycheck during the year. As an independent contractor,
he  was  responsible  for  his  own  taxes,  including  paying  quarterly  estimated  taxes.  He
was not as educated about the tax laws as he should have been, and he did not pay the

quarterly taxes in the mistaken belief that he could pay the taxes by the standard April
15th deadline.4
In  2017,  Applicant  paid  the  taxes  owed  for  tax  year  2016.  He  received  a  pay
raise in 2017, and he still did not pay the quarterly taxes. Applicant had a professional
prepare his and his wife’s joint tax returns for 2017 in February 2018. The federal return
indicated that their tax liability for 2017 was $31,062. There was $6,507 withheld during
the year from his wife’s paychecks, leaving a balance of $24,766. Their state tax return
indicated they owed $5,967.5
Applicant’s  and  his  wife’s  tax  liability  for  2017  was  much  higher  than  he
expected, and he was unable to pay it when their tax returns were filed. He paid the IRS
$500  with  the  return  and  $3,500  in  April  and  May  2018.  He  hired  a  different  tax
professional who filed amended returns on their behalf in June 2018. The IRS reduced
their  tax  liability  by  $7,123.  He  paid  an  additional  $3,000  to  the  IRS  in  August  and
September 2018. He established an installment agreement with the IRS in September
2018.  The  agreement  called  for  payments  of  $1,000  per  month.  Between  September
2018 and February 2019, he paid the IRS an additional $12,000, to completely pay his
tax liability for 2017. He received a $492 refund.6
Applicant  paid  the  IRS  $13,044  in  March  2019  for  his  2018  taxes.  In  January
2019,  he  paid  his  state  $4,742  for  taxes  owed  for  2017.  He  paid  his  state  $4,928  in
March 2019 for his 2018 taxes.7
Applicant’s current finances are in order. He is now aware of his requirements to
pay  quarterly  taxes.  He  credibly  testified  that  he  will  comply  with  all  his  tax
responsibilities in the future.8
