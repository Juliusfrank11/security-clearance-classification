Applicant  admitted  to  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  through  1.g.,  and  1.k.
through 1.n. He denied SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.h. through 1.j. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 14 line
4  to  page  15  line  5,  and  GX  1  at  pages  5  and  15.)  He  has  been  employed  with  the
defense  contractor  since  March  of  2016,  but  he  does  not  currently  have  a  security
clearance. (Id.) Applicant served in the Marine Corps from 2008~2013. (TR at page 14
line  11  to  page  15  line  23, and  GX  1 at page  25.)  He  was  deployed  “to  Iraq  in  2009,”
and “to Afghanistan in 2010 to 2011.” (Id.) As a result, he receives 70% compensation
from  the  Veterans  Administration.  (TR  at  page  15  lines  2-~23.)  Applicant  received  an
Honorable Discharge. (GX 1 at page 26.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
Applicant  attributes  his  current  financial  difficulties  to  a  divorce  in  2012,  and
periods of unemployment in 2013 and in 2014. (TR at page 15 line 9 to page 19 line 2.)
1.a.~1.d., 1.f., and 1.k.~1.n. Applicant admits that he has past-due debts to eight
different creditors totaling about $20,121. (TR at page 19 at line 23 to page 23 line 8, at
page 26 line 7 to page 33 line 2, and at page 35 line 14 to page 36 line 19.)  On New
Year’s Eve, four months after the issuance of the SOR, Applicant sent the following two
line, letter request to each of these creditors. (AppXs a~d, f, and k~n.) In each letter he
simply requested the following: “this letter is being sent to you to request information on
my account. I would like to be sent a statement with current amount due and minimum
monthly  payment  options  to  be  able  to  resolve  this  credit  account.”  (Id.)  Applicant’s
recent  requests,  though  laudable,  are  too  little  too  late.  He  has  had  years  to  address
these  known  delinquencies  that  remain  outstanding.  These  allegations  are  found
against Applicant.
1.e. Applicant has paid the alleged $35 past-due debt to Creditor E, as evidenced
by correspondence with Creditor E. (TR at page 34 line 17 to page 35 line 13, and AppX
E.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.g. Applicant successfully disputed an alleged $14,257 past-due debt to Creditor
G;  and  as  such,  it  does  not  appear  on  the  Government’s  two  most  recent  2018  credit
reports. (TR at page 24 line 16 to page 26 line 6, and GXs 4 and 5.) This allegation is
found for Applicant.
1.h.~1.j.  Applicant  successfully  disputed  three  alleged  past-due  debts,  totaling
about $3,104, to Creditor H; and as such, they do not appears on the Government’s two
most  recent 2018  credit  reports.  (TR at page  23  line  9  to  page  24  line 15,  and  GXs 4
and 5.) These allegations are found for Applicant.
