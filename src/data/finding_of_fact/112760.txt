Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for
her  current  employer  since  2007.  She  is  a  high  school  graduate,  and  she  went  to  a
trade school. She married in 1992 and divorced in 2004. She married again in 2011 and
divorced in 2016. She does not have children.1
Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  problems.  She  filed  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy
case in 1991, and her debts were discharged in 1992. She admitted that the bankruptcy
resulted from her financial  irresponsibility. She and  her first husband filed  a Chapter  7
bankruptcy  case  in  2001,  and  their  debts  were  discharged  the  same  year.  Her  first
husband  handled  the  family’s  finances.  She  is  unsure  what  caused  the  second
bankruptcy.2
Applicant’s  second  husband  was  abusive.  She  moved  out  and  filed  for  a
restraining  order  against  him  in  February  2014.  She  withdrew  the  petition  after  he
pleaded with her that it could adversely affect his security clearance, and he agreed to
go  to  counseling.  They  reconciled  for  a  period,  and  then  the  abuse  started  again.  He
threatened to kill her. She moved out permanently in October 2015 with “a couch, a TV,
four plates, [her] clothing, and [her] dog.”3
Applicant  essentially  had  to  start all  over.  She  used  credit  cards to  get  back  on
her feet. She received her health insurance from her second husband. She has health
problems,  and  she  had  to  start  paying  for  her  own  health  insurance.  Her  insurance
premiums  are  high,  and  she  has  a  large  deductible.  She  missed  a  month  of  work
because of her health, and she cared for her mother who has cancer. She was unable
to maintain the credit card payments, and a number of debts became delinquent.4
The SOR alleges the two Chapter 7 bankruptcy cases, a $2,453 judgment, and
12 delinquent debts totaling about $24,146. Applicant admitted owing all the debts, but
she stated that the judgment was paid through garnishment of her wages. She indicated
that the creditor for the $4,263 and $1,019 debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.j obtained
a  judgment  and  a  garnishment  order  against  her  that  was  soon  to  go  into  effect.  She
also  stated  that  her  federal  income  tax  refund  of  about  $500  was  diverted  toward  the
military exchange account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. The SOR debts are listed on a March
2018 credit report.5

Applicant has worked a second job since November 2016. She lives frugally. She
traded her car in for a cheaper model. She lowered her cell phone and cable plans. She
consulted  with  an  attorney  who  advised  her  to  file  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  case.  She
wants  to  pay  her  debts,  and  insisted  on  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  case.  She  paid  the
attorney’s retainer, and the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was filed on March 13, 2019.
She  received  financial  counseling  as  a  requirement  of  the  bankruptcy.  The  monthly
payment  to  the  trustee  will  be  $375.  She  indicated  that  she  will  keep  her  second  job,
and she will be able to make her monthly payments. She credibly testified that she will
continue  with  the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  until  resolution.  She  also  stated  that  she  is
willing to provide the DOD with updates on the status of the bankruptcy.6
Applicant  submitted  a  letter  attesting  to  her  excellent  job  performance  at  her
second  job.  She  is  praised  for  her  honesty,  work  ethic,  trustworthiness,  reliability,
dependability, and integrity.7
