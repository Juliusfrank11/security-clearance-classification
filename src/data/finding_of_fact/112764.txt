While  Applicant’s  parents  were  married,  they  purchased  properties,  including
apartment  buildings.  (Tr.  40,  45)  Upon  Applicant’s  father’s  death  in  2012,  her  mother
inherited 40% of his estate. The remaining 60% was divided among Applicant, her sister,
and four half-siblings. Applicant inherited two small apartments. She subsequently sold
one for $27,000, and transferred the proceeds of the sale into her U.S. bank account. Her
mother has rented out the other apartment. Applicant does not receive any rental monies
because they are used for repairs and maintenance. (Tr. 46-48) She thinks her mother’s

In 2014, Applicant visited the Turkish Consulate in the United States, in order to
obtain  proof  that  she  was  related  to  her  deceased  father  and  entitled  to  receive  an
inheritance. Her married name had caused confusion with her Turkish documents. While
at the consulate, she discussed her situation with a woman employee, who helped her
resolve the problem. Before leaving the consulate, Applicant heard the woman employee
speak  German.  Applicant  then  began  talking  to  the  woman  in  German.  After  a  few
minutes, the woman gave Applicant her business card. Applicant subsequently ”friended”
the  woman  on  Facebook,  and  sent  a  Facebook  message  thanking  her  for  her  help  in
resolving  the  name  issue.  Several  weeks  later,  Applicant  “unfriended”  the  woman
because  she  was  concerned  that  she  should  not  converse  with  a  Turkish  official.

Turkey
Turkey  is  a  constitutional  republic  with  a  multiparty  parliamentary  system.  The
president’s powers are not precisely defined and his influence depends on his personality
and  political  weight.  Its  citizens  and  foreigners  have  been  targeted  by  domestic  and
transnational terrorist groups for many years. There have been terrorist bombings in the
past five years resulting in deaths. The targets have been religious, government, political,
tourist,  and  business  locations  throughout  the  country.  In  addition,  leftist  and  Islamic
terrorist groups have targeted U.S. and Western interests. The potential for future terrorist
attacks remains high. Its judiciary is declared to be independent, but is in need of reform.
There  are  significant  human  rights  abuses  with  respect  to  detainees  and  personal
freedoms. The U.S. State Department warns citizens to reconsider travel to Turkey due
to the presence of terrorism. (HE 1)
