Applicant  is  a  66-year-old  naturalized  U.S.  citizen.  He  is  married  and  has  two
children.  He  has  worked  for  a  government  contractor  since  February  2011.  He  served
on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from  1984  to  2007,  when  he  retired  honorably.  He
denied the delinquent debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. (Answer; Item 4.)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  was  indebted  to  a  mortgage  holder  in  the
amount  of  $296,546.  This  debt  was  reflected  on  his  May  2017  and  July  2018  credit
reports as a charged-off account. (Item 5; Item 6.) Records reflect Applicant purchased
a condominium in 2005 for $379,000, for his daughter to reside in while Applicant was
stationed  overseas.  He  financed  the  purchase  with  a  $303,192  fixed-rate  loan  from
lender 1 and a flexible-rate loan of $75,798 from lender 2. Lender 1 apparently sold the
debt for collection (or transferred the mortgage) to the creditor identified in SOR ¶ 1.a.
In  July  2011,  Applicant  purchased  his  current  residence  for  approximately  $369,900
financed through a different lender. He then decided he wanted to sell the condominium
he bought for his daughter to reside in. He explained in his Answer:
During the real estate down market in 2011, with the assistance of a Real
Estate  Agent,  I  attempted  to  sell  my  condominium  located  at  [address
omitted].  However,  the  bank  refused  to  settle  and  instead  foreclosed  the
property and sold it to the highest bidder. (Answer.)
He  attached  a  property  profile  for  the  condominium,  which  showed  that  the
property  was  sold  through foreclosure  in  November  2012 for $180,000.  (Answer.)  The
record does not allege or reflect the status of the home loan made by lender 2.
In his Response, Applicant attached a  recent credit report, which shows he has
an  excellent  credit  rating.  He  indicated  “the  foreclosure,  which  will  not  happen  again,
occurred  a  long  time  ago  (seven  (7)  years  to  be  exact)  due  to  the  real  estate  down
market.” (Response.)
