In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments most of the factual
allegations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.b. through 1.d.). Applicant’s admissions and comments
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the
evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due  consideration  of  same,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 70-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
under  a  variety  of  titles  (i.e.,  drafting  supervisor,  lead  technologist,  and  engineering
analyst) with his current employer (known by a variety of names after acquisitions) since
December  2005.  A  1966  high  school  graduate,  he  received  an  associate’s  degree  in
1974. Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy in April 1968, and he was honorably discharged
in October 1969 with a pre-existing physical disability. He was granted a secret clearance
in October 2006. Applicant was married in 1970, and divorced in 1982. He remarried in
1986, and was divorced three months later that same year. He married his current wife in
1987. He has two daughters, born in 1973 and 1984.

Financial Considerations2
It is unclear to what factors Applicant attributed his financial problems, or to when
those factors actually commenced. He generally referred to various situations with some
financial significance to him, but he does not claim that they caused him not to timely file
his federal income tax returns or to have insufficient funds to pay any of his debts. They
were simply alternative ways to spend his money. For example, he mentioned taking a
sabbatical or temporary retirement at the age of 50; a year of sailing from Michigan around
the Gulf of Mexico to various locations in Florida; family medical issues; there was a stock
market “setback;” being disorganized; he lost or misplaced all of his records for the tax
year  2012  during  a  move  in  2013;  his  parents  died  in  2016;  there  was  a  hurricane  in
October 2018; he purchased some property for an autistic grandson; and he and his wife
have paid for, and attended, various real estate investment programs to create a business
for a decent retirement income.3 While Applicant mentioned those factors, he submitted
no specific information or documents to indicate  in what way they were largely beyond
Applicant’s  control;  and  what  impact  they  may  have  had  on  his  finances  and  actions
relative thereto.
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): When it was time for Applicant to file his federal income tax return
for the tax year 2012, he timely filed for an extension, and he sent the IRS an estimated
payment of $1,397. The IRS granted the extension until October 15, 2013.4 During the
extension  period,  Applicant  was  unable
the  necessary  supporting
documentation, such as his W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, and other documents, and
he eventually failed to timely file his income tax return by the end of the extension period.5

5  The  legal  requirement  to  file  a  federal  income  tax  return  is  based  upon  an  individual’s  gross
income and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined that there is an obligation to so  file, the
following applies:
Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title
or  by  regulations  made  under  authority  thereof  to  make  a  return,  keep  any  records,  or
supply  any  information,  who  willfully  fails  to  pay  such  estimated  tax  or  tax,  make  such
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law
or  regulations,  shall,  in  addition  to  other  penalties  provided  by  law,  be  guilty  of  a
misdemeanor  and,  upon  conviction  thereof,  shall  be  fined  not  more  than  $25,000
($100,000  in  the  case  of  a  corporation),  or  imprisoned  not  more  than  1  year,  or  both,
together  with  the  costs  of  prosecution.  In  the  case  of  any  person  with  respect  to  whom
there is a failure to pay any estimated tax, this section shall not apply to such person with
respect to such failure if there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect
to such failure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the first
Although he made some unspecified efforts to locate the necessary documentation, both
from the IRS and from his employer, his efforts proved fruitless, and they were essentially
abandoned by him.6 As of June 2018, when he responded to the interrogatories, Applicant
had still not filed his federal income tax return for the tax year 2012.   In April 2019, six
and one-half years after the extended due date for the filing, and over six months after
the SOR was issued, Applicant reported that he was able to obtain a copy of his W-2. He
claimed that he finally sent his federal income tax return for the tax year 2012 to the IRS
during the week of the April 2019 hearing.7 Applicant did not submit a copy of the subject
federal income tax return to support his claim that it had finally been filed.
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant failed to timely file his
federal income tax return for the tax year 2013.8 An official Account Transcript from the
IRS reflects that Applicant failed to file his 2013 income tax return until March 2015, one
year after it was required to be filed.9 Applicant’s adjusted gross income during the tax
year 2013 was reported to be $186,348. During the period 2014 through early 2017, the
IRS  issued  several  notices  to  Applicant,  assessed  penalties,  additional  taxes,  and
interest,  and  eventually  issued  a  levy.  In  April  2017,  an  Installment  Agreement  was
established under which Applicant agree to have $700 per month automatically withdrawn
from  his  bank  account.  Because  of  some  incorrect  bank  account  information,  monthly
withdrawals were attempted but promptly cancelled. As of June 4, 2018, Applicant’s tax
balance  plus  accruals was  $28,703.35.10  In  October  2018  –  approximately  one  month
after the SOR was issued – Applicant agreed to a new Installment Agreement, restarting
the $700 monthly withdrawals. As of April 2, 2019, the unpaid balance for 2013 has been
reduced  to  $26,936.90.11  The  2013  delinquencies  are  finally  in  the  process  of  being
resolved.

8 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal
Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to
evaluate  an  applicant's  evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to  consider
whether  an  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful  rehabilitation;  (d)  to  decide  whether  a  particular
provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis
under Directive § 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No.
02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also
ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd.
Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant’s unlisted and unalleged
failure to timely file his federal income tax returns will be considered only for the five purposes listed above.

(SOR ¶ 1.c.): Applicant timely filed his federal income tax return for the tax year
2014.  His  adjusted  gross  income  during  that  tax  year  was  initially  reported  to  be
$86,275,12 but that amount was subsequently increased to $130,675.13 During the period
2015 through early 2017, the IRS issued several notices to Applicant, assessed penalties,
additional taxes, and interest, and eventually issued a levy. In April 2017, the Installment
Agreement  described  above  was  established,  but  eventually  terminated.  Although  the
new  Installment  Agreement  was  established  in  October  2018,  restarting  the  monthly
withdrawals,  priority  has  been  given  to  the  resolution  of  unpaid  2013  taxes  while
Applicant’s unpaid 2014 taxes wait in line with the unpaid balance increasing. In March
2019, Applicant’s unpaid 2014 balance was $15,294.48,14 and on April 2, 2019, it had
increased to $15,344.15.15 The 2014 delinquencies are not yet in the process of being
resolved.
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant failed to timely file his
federal  income  tax  return  for  the  tax  year  2015,  claiming  that  when  he  received  IRS
notification regarding his tax issues for the tax years 2012 through 2014, he “was flustered
. . . and forgot to file or pay.”16 An official Account Transcript from the IRS reflects that
Applicant failed to file his 2015 income tax return until November 2016, one month after
it was required to be filed if an extension request had been made, or six months after the
original  due  date.17  In  this  instance,  there  is  no  evidence  that  Applicant  requested  an
extension. Applicant’s adjusted gross income during the tax year 2015 was reported to
be  $132,246.  During  the  period  late  2016  through  early  2017,  the  IRS  issued  several
notices  to  Applicant,  assessed  penalties  and  interest,  and  eventually  issued  a  levy.  In
April 2017, the Installment Agreement described above was established, but eventually
terminated. Although the new Installment Agreement was established in October 2018,
restarting  the  monthly  withdrawals,  priority  has  been  given  to  the  resolution  of  unpaid
2013  taxes  while  Applicant’s  unpaid  2014  and  2015  taxes  wait  in  line  with  the  unpaid
balances increasing. In March 2019, Applicant’s unpaid 2015 balance was $9,447.65,18
and on April 2, 2019, it had increased to $9,476.19.19 The 2015 delinquencies are not yet
in the process of being resolved.

Applicant  submitted  a  Personal  Financial  Statement  to  reflect  his  $7,195  net
monthly income; $3,311 in monthly expenses; and a purported $3,428 in debt payments,
including his IRS payments, with a $456 monthly remainder.20 As of April 2019, in addition
to $51,757 in unpaid federal income taxes,21 Applicant currently owes a total of $176,604
for a mortgage, a vehicle loan, and six credit cards or charge accounts.22 In Applicant’s
payoff  schedule,  he  set  priorities  for  the  resolution  of  all  of  his  accounts,  including  his
unpaid IRS balance. Of the nine accounts listed, the IRS holds the least priority, and it
has him scheduled to continue making monthly $700 payments over the next five years,
with three final balloon payments of nearly $4,000 commencing in December 2023.23 He
noted that such a plan does not interfere with his 401(k) contributions, and it allows him
to retire again in five years as previously planned.24
Approximately five years ago, Applicant met with a financial planner to set up an
annuity  for  his  eventual  retirement.25  While  he  claimed  to  have  a  three-ring  binder  of
paperwork  from  his  financial  planner,  Applicant  did  not  specify  or  identify  any  of  the
documents, and, although he was asked to submit such information, and indicated that
he  would  do  so,  he  failed  to  submit  any  documentation  to  indicate  the  nature  of  the
financial counseling that he received. In addition, Applicant stated that he is now working
with a different financial planner, since his first one passed away, and they are reviewing
Applicant’s retirement plans to make sure they are sound, and Applicant does not incur
any  additional  tax  burdens  as  a  result  of  turning  70  and  one-half.26  There  is  some
evidence to indicate that Applicant’s financial situation, with respect to his federal income
taxes, is now under better control.
