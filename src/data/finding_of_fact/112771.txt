The  amended  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  nine  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately  $56,000
two  vehicle
repossessions  (¶¶  1.b  and  1.c);  four  charged-off  accounts  (¶¶  1.d  –  1.g),  and  two
accounts  in  collection  (¶¶  1.h  and  1.i).  It  also  alleges  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file
federal tax returns for tax years 2012, 2015, 2017, and 2018 (¶ 1.j).
including  delinquent  child  support  (¶  1.a);
Applicant denied SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j. He partially admitted SOR ¶
1.b,  and  admitted  all  of  the  remaining  allegations  (¶¶  1.d  –  1.f,  and  1.i).  His  SOR
admissions, and those at the hearing, are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a
thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  45-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  graduated  from
high  school  in  1993,  and  shortly  thereafter  enlisted  in  the  U.S.  Navy.  He  served
honorably on active duty until he was medically retired in 2007. He possessed a secret
clearance during his service.
Applicant married in 1995 and divorced in 1996. He married his wife in 2001. He
has  a  step-child  age  22,  and  three  children,  ages  24,  19  and  18.  Applicant  has  been
attending college since 2007, and anticipates earning a bachelor’s degree in December
2019.
Applicant’s work history indicates that after his discharge from the service he was
unemployed  for  about  three  months.  He  then  worked  full-time  for  different  employers
between February 2008 and August 2015. He was unemployed between August 2015
and  February  2016.  He  was  hired  by  the  federal  contractor  currently  sponsoring  his
clearance in February 2016. (GE 2)
In  his  response  to  Section  26  (Financial  Record)  of  his  2016  SCA,  Applicant
disclosed that he had financial problems. Specifically, he stated that after losing his job
in  2009  he  became  delinquent  on  his  child  support  obligation.  He  disclosed  no
additional  financial  problems.  Although  not  alleged,  Applicant  responded  “NO”  to
questions asking whether he had any delinquent, in-collection, or charged-off accounts.
He failed to disclose the charged off, in collection, or delinquent accounts alleged in the
SOR. He also failed to disclose that he did not  timely file his federal income tax return
for tax years 2012 and 2015.
Applicant filed his federal income tax return for tax year 2012 in March 2014. He
was issued a $2,563 refund. He timely filed his federal income tax returns for tax years
2013  and  2014.  He  was  issued  refunds  for  both  tax  years  of  $1,592  and  $2,229,
respectively.  Applicant  filed  his  federal  income  tax  return  for tax  year  2015  in  January
2017.  He  filed  his  federal  income  tax  return  for  tax  year  2016  in  May  2017.  The  IRS
considered  his  2017  filing  timely.  Applicant  filed  his  federal  income  tax  return  for  tax
year 2017 in July 2019. As of May 2019, Applicant had not filed his 2018 federal income
tax return and he did not ask for an extension of time to file. (GE 3)
Concerning  SOR  ¶  1.a  (delinquent  child  support),  Applicant’s  documentary
evidence  shows  that  he  has  been  timely  paying  his  child  support  obligation  since
December 2015. The original delinquent obligation was for $32,968. Applicant has paid
$29,243  as  of  May  2019.  Notwithstanding  the  payments  made,  Applicant  intends  to
dispute  the  child  support  payments  made  and  request  reimbursement,  because  his
son’s mother had released him from his child support obligation for a period, and there
were  several  periods  during  which  the  child  was  staying  with  him  either  because  the
mother was deployed or incarcerated.
Applicant  intends  to  dispute  the  accounts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.c  (two
vehicle repossessions). He explained that he refinanced two vehicles through the same
credit union. One of the vehicles’ engine seized while he was in the process of disputing
the purchase with the seller and stopped paying the car note because the car was not
working.  The  credit  union  repossessed  both  cars  for  lack  of  payments  on  the  loan.
Applicant  believes  the  repossession  of  the  second  vehicle  was  unfair  and  that  it  was
sold in auction for less than its fair value. Notwithstanding, he presented no evidence to
show he has filed electronic or written disputes against the seller, financial institution, or
the credit bureaus concerning the above accounts. Applicant stated that he is disputing
the accounts, but understands that likely he will have to pay them.
Applicant settled the accounts alleged in SOR  ¶¶ 1.d and 1.f for less than what
he owes on May 20, 2019. (AE 6) For SOR ¶ 1.d, he promised to make $200 monthly
payments  in  June,  July,  and  August  2019.  For  SOR  ¶  1.f,  he  promised  to  make  $100
monthly payments in June, July, and August 2019. The record closed before any of the
payments were made, so there is no documentary evidence in the record to confirm any
payments were made.
Applicant  settled  the  account  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  on  May  14,  2019.  He
authorized the creditor to charge $92 against his credit card for four consecutive months
starting June 2019. The record closed before any of the payments were made, so there
is no documentary evidence in the record to confirm the payments.
Applicant  was  not  aware  of  the  account alleged  in  SOR  ¶ 1.g  and  he  denied  it.
He  testified  that  he  contacted  the  creditor  and  the  creditor  does  not  know  what  the
account  was  for,  and  does  not  have  any  information  connecting  Applicant  to  the
account. (Tr. 42) Applicant initially denied the account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h, but paid it
in  May  2019.  (AE  6)  He  testified  that  he  paid  the  account  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.i.  He
believes that it was related to his son’s cancer treatment when he was five years old. He
presented no documentary evidence of this payment.
Applicant presented little documentary evidence to show that he had contact with
his  creditors,  made  payments,  established  payment  arrangements,  disputed  accounts,
or  otherwise  resolved  any  of  the  accounts  alleged  before  the  SOR  was  issued.  He
presented  no  evidence  to  show  he  has  participated  in  financial  counseling  or  that  he
has a working budget.
Concerning his delinquent taxes, Applicant did not explain why he did not timely
file his 2012 and 2015 income tax returns. He did not file his 2017 and 2018 income tax
returns because he intends to dispute his child support arrearages as soon as his son is
emancipated. He was anticipating receiving refunds, and because of a garnishment filed
against  him, the  refunds  would  have  been  given  to  the mother of his son for past-due
child support. He believes that he is entitled to credit for the periods his son was living
with him, for child support he paid, and for a period the mother waived the child support
payments. He believes that if he had filed the tax returns and the mother was given the
refunds, he would not be able to recover the money from her.
Applicant  explained  that  his  financial  problems  resulted  from  periods  of
unemployment  and  underemployment,  and  having  to  pay  child  support.  Applicant
expressed remorse for not filing his income tax returns on time. He claimed that he has
learned a hard lesson and promised to timely file his income tax returns and to pay his
taxes in the future.
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  highlighted  that  he  has  worked  for  the  federal
government for the last 25 years, basically doing the same job that he did while in the
service.  He  believes  his  past  behavior  has  proven  that  he  is  not  a  security  risk.
Applicant  noted  that  his  wife  is  about  to  graduate  and  he  anticipates  she  will  start
working and contributing to the household finances in the near future. He  believes that
with  their  combined  income,  he  will  be  able  to  pay  his  financial  obligations  and  living
expenses. He believes that he is doing the best he can do in his current circumstances.
He is concerned about not getting his clearance and losing his job.
