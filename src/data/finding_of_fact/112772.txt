Applicant admitted all of the allegations but SOR ¶ 1.c, which she denied. She is
32 years old. She is single and she has one child, a minor. (Tr. at 48, 72, 115; GE 1).
Applicant obtained her high school equivalency certificate in 2004 and attended
some  college  since  2010,  but  has  not  yet  earned  a  degree.  She  has  worked  for  her
current employer, a DOD contractor, since April 2017. She was a program manager as
of the date of the hearing. She has never held a security clearance. (Tr. at 6, 20-21, 71-
75, 98; GE 1, 7).
The SOR alleges  three judgments totaling $18,959 entered against Applicant in
2008, 2015, and 2016 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.c); a $415 delinquent student loan (SOR ¶ 1.h);
and seven delinquent consumer accounts totaling $14,248 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d - 1.g, 1.i - 1.k).
The  debts  are  established  by  court  records  and  credit  reports  from  2017  and  2018.
Applicant  also  disclosed  and  discussed  her  debts  in  her  2017  security  clearance
application (SCA) and during her 2018 background interviews. (GE 1-7).
Applicant  attributed  her  delinquent  debts  to  earning  a  minimal  income  with
various  employers  from  approximately  2007  to  December  2015.  From  2007  to  2010,
she  worked  for  a  county  health  department  at  $15  hourly  in  an  exempt,  non-full-time
position,  and  she  was  required  to  “work  up  to  a  certain  amount  of  cap  hours  for  that
year,”  take  a  month  of  unemployment,  then  be  rehired.  In  2009,  she  became  a  single
parent.  Her  child’s  father  earns  minimum  wage  as  a  construction  worker  and  owes
approximately  $25,000  in  delinquent  child  support  for  2010  to  2016.  He  only  began
contributing  $240  monthly  towards  their  child’s  tutoring  expenses  in  2016.  (Tr.  at  71-
125; GE 1, 7).
In August 2014, Applicant was laid off by her employer due to a reorganization.
She was unemployed until May 2015, when she obtained part-time employment at $18
hourly  for  20  hours  per  week.  She  relied  on  her  employer’s  representation  that  her
position  was  slated  to  become  a  full-time  one.  In  around  September  2015,  she  was
notified by a county housing program, which had an income cap of $35,000 to $40,000
annually,  that  an  apartment  for  which  she  had  been  waitlisted  for  six  years  was
available for her and her child. She then moved with her child out of her parents’ home
and  into  her  own  apartment.  Her  expenses  increased  from  a  monthly  contribution  of
$400 to $800 monthly in rent plus other household expenses. When she obtained full-
time  employment  in  December  2015,  her  income  increased  to  $40,000  annually.  As
required, she notified the county housing authority and her monthly rent was increased
to $1,200 monthly. Though she was prepared for her rent increase, she was unprepared
for the amount in which it did. She also cited to out-of-pocket medical expenses for her
and  her  child,  and  the  compromise  of  her  bank  account  in  July  2018,  as  additional
factors that contributed to her financial delinquencies. (Tr. at 71-125, 135; GE 1, 7).
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c consist of three judgments entered against Applicant in
2008 for $1,158; 2015 for $15,449; and 2016 for $2,352. The 2008 judgment for $1,158
(SOR ¶ 1.c) was for a credit card Applicant obtained in approximately 2014, with a $500
credit  limit.  She  paid  $2,348  to  resolve  this  debt  in  April  2019,  and  the  judgment  was
resolved as of October 2019. (Tr. at 83-87, 93, 99-103, 113, 128-130, 146-148; AE P,
T).
The  2015  judgment  for  $15,449  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  was  for  a  $29,000  car  loan
Applicant obtained in approximately 2011 for a used car. She testified that she became
delinquent when she missed four monthly payments after her 2014 layoff, and when her
monthly rent increased in late 2015. She testified that she unsuccessfully attempted to
reach  a  payment  plan  with  the  creditor  in  the  summer  of  2014,  but  the  creditor
demanded payment in full of $20,000. Her car was  repossessed in October 2014. She
testified that she reached a payment plan with the creditor’s collection agency to repay
half  of  the  outstanding  balance  at  $434  monthly  for  36  months,  after  which  time  she
would  enroll  the  remaining  balance  in  her  debt-consolidation  plan.  She  made  a  $150
payment to the collection agency in November 2018. She testified that she was unable
to  try  to  resolve  this  judgment  sooner  because  she  prioritized  other  expenses.  (Tr.  at
83-87, 93, 99-103, 108, 113, 125-128, 146-148; AE C, D, S, T).
The 2016 judgment for $2,352 (SOR ¶ 1.a) was for Applicant’s delinquent rent for
her  apartment  with  the  county  housing  program.  She  was  already  $1,600  delinquent
when her rent was increased in late 2015. She ended her lease in November 2016 after
she unsuccessfully attempted to obtain rental assistance and could no longer afford her
rent. She paid this judgment in September and October 2018. She testified that she was
also unable to pay it sooner because she prioritized other expenses. (Tr. at 83-87, 93,
99-103, 118-125; AE A, B).
SOR  ¶  1.d  is  for  an  $11,028  charged-off  auto  loan  that  Applicant  obtained  in
November 2014.  After  her credit  was  negatively  affected  by  her car repossession, her
only  available  option  for  another  means  of  transportation  for  her  and  her  child  was
through  a  high-interest-rate  loan.  She  testified  that  she  enrolled  this  debt  in  her  debt-
consolidation plan, and payment plan negotiations were underway. (Tr. at 103-107, 113,
130-134; AE D, S, T).
SOR  ¶  1.e  is for  a  credit  card  in  collection for $818.  Applicant  testified that  she
obtained  this  credit  card  in  an  attempt  to  rebuild  her  credit,  but  it  came  with  a  high
interest  rate  and  additional  fees.  The  card  became  delinquent  in  June  2015.  She
testified that she paid this debt from June 2015 until May 2018, when her bank account
was  compromised,  and  she  then  forgot  to  provide  the  creditor  with  her  updated  bank
information. She believed this debt was going to be imminently resolved with the funds
she paid into her debt-consolidation plan. (Tr. at 107, 113-114, 134-136; AE D, S, T).
SOR  ¶  1.f  is  for  a  credit  card  past  due  for  $120  with  a  total  balance  of  $555.
Applicant  testified  that  she  also  obtained  this  credit  card  in  an  attempt  to  rebuild  her
credit.  She  also  believed  it  would  be  imminently  resolved  with  the  funds  she  paid  into
her debt-consolidation plan. (Tr. at 106-107, 113-114, 136-137; AE D, S, T).
SOR  ¶  1.g  is  for  a  credit  card  past  due  for  $111  with  a  total  balance  of  $433.
Applicant  testified  that  she  obtained  this  credit  card  in  November  2015,  also  in  an
attempt to rebuild her credit. The card became delinquent in 2017. She settled this debt
for $228 and paid it in October 2018. As of November 2018, the creditor considered this
debt resolved. (Tr. at 107, 113, 137l; AE E, F).
SOR ¶ 1.h is for a federal student loan placed for collection for $415. Applicant
obtained a $1,000 student loan in around 2010 or 2012 for her college tuition. She could
not recall when it became delinquent. She made minimal payments of $5 monthly from
June 2015 to May 2016, and five payments of $204 from January through March 2018
towards this student loan. She settled this loan for $380 and the creditor stated it was
resolved as of April 2019. (Tr. at 72, 98-99, 107, 113, 137-139, 146-148; AE G, H, Q, T).
SOR  ¶  1.i  is for a  prepaid  credit  card  past  due  for $157  with  a  total  balance  of
$395. Applicant testified that this credit card became delinquent in around 2017. In her
Answer, she stated that she established a five-month payment plan to resolve this debt.
She  made  three  payments  of  $78  in  October  and  November  2018.  She  made  a  final
payment of $172 in April 2019 to resolve this debt. (Tr. at 107, 113, 139-141, 146-147;
AE I, J, R, T).
SOR ¶¶ 1.j and 1.k are for two cable accounts placed for collection for $732 and
$287. Applicant testified that she had this cable service when she rented an apartment.
She returned the equipment in November 2017 and she testified that the fee in SOR ¶
1.j  was  waived  as  a  result.  She  also  testified  that  she  paid  the  final  bill  in  SOR  ¶  1.k,
and  she provided  documentation  reflecting  that  she made a  $186 payment  in  October
2018. (Tr. at 108, 141-143; AE K, L).
Applicant enrolled the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, 1.f in her debt-consolidation plan
in October 2018. She testified that she also included a $700 telephone debt and a $100
to $300 cash advance in her plan. Her plan provides that she pay $238 monthly “for the
purposes of accumulating funds for settlements and the payment of our fees . . . .” She
testified  that  she  paid  $16,000  into  her  plan  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  and  a
representative  informed  her  that  it  would  take  approximately  five  years  to  resolve  her
outstanding  debts  enrolled  in  the  plan.  She  testified  that  she  received  financial
counseling  from  the  debt-consolidation  company;  she  developed  a  budget  and  had
separate  bank  accounts  from  which  she  paid  her  bills  and  set  aside  her  spending
money; she checked her credit reports and was working on increasing her credit score;
and she intended to live within her means. She earns approximately $40,000 to $50,000
annually and estimated a $1,500 monthly net remainder after expenses, which she sets
aside for emergency expenses, savings, or to resolve some of her smaller debts in her
debt-consolidation plan. She testified that she had approximately $700 in savings. (Tr.
at 64-65, 72, 104-105, 108-114, 124-125, 136, 143-146, 148-151; AE D, S, T).
The  chief  executive  officer  (CEO)  of  Applicant’s  employer,  since  its  founding  in
2010,  testified.  He  has  worked  in  the  classified  arena  for  approximately  20  years.  He
hired  Applicant  as  a  program  manager  in  April  2017,  at  an  initial  annual  salary  of
$40,000. In May 2018, she was promoted to supervise a team of two, and her annual
salary as of the date of the hearing was $50,000. He interacts with her daily. He testified
that he first learned about the extent of Applicant’s financial problems when their facility
security officer (FSO) notified him of such after she completed her 2017 SCA. He further
learned  about  her  indebtedness  when  he  reviewed  the  SOR  after  it  was  issued  in
August  2018.  He  attributed  her  delinquent  finances  to  her  youth  and  lack  of  steady
employment. He testified that he worked “extensively” with Applicant to ensure that she
was  resolving  her  debts,  and  he  had  no  concerns  about  her  ability  or  willingness  to
continue do so. He testified that she had proven herself “responsible” over the two-year
period  of  her  employment.  He  described  her  as  a  “model  employee”  with  exceptional
performance.  Character  references,  to  include  her  FSO  and  two  coworkers,  also
attested to her trustworthiness and reliability. (Tr. at 16-41; AE M, N, O).
Applicant’s  boyfriend  testified.  As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  he  was  an  active
duty  member  of  the  U.S.  military  earning  approximately  $60,000  annually.  He  and
Applicant began dating in around January 2018, and Applicant moved in with him  that
December. He has since paid their larger household expenses, and she has paid their
smaller ones, so that she can focus on repaying her delinquent debts through her debt-
consolidation  plan.  He  was  aware  of  the  SOR  allegations.  He  also  attributed  her
delinquent  debts  to  her  immaturity  and  was  confident  that  she  learned  from  her
mistakes and would responsibly handle her finances going forward. (Tr.at 41-71).
