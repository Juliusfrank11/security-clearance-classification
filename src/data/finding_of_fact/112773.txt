In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,
1.b, 1.d-1.t, and 1.ll. She denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.u-1.kk. She stated
that the state tax lien alleged in SOR ¶  1.c had been paid, and  that the medical debts
alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.u-1.kk  were  disputed  and  removed  from  her  credit  record.  At  the
hearing,  Department  Counsel  conceded  that  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  had  been
paid  and  withdrew  that  allegation.  (Tr.  9.)  Applicant’s  admissions  in  her  answer  to  the
SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  39-year-old  customer-service  auditor  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since March 2017. She married in  July 2004 and divorced in October 2011.
She has two children, ages 15 and 10. (Tr. 20.) She has been employed continuously in
various  jobs  since  at  least  January  2007,  the  period  covered  in  her  e-QIP.  She  has
never held a security clearance or eligibility for a public trust position.
Applicant  filed  a  petition  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  in  May  2015.  It  was
dismissed in February 2016 for failure to make the required payments. (Tr. 23.). When
the  petition  was  dismissed,  $400  had  been  disbursed  to  creditors  and  $689  had  been
disbursed for administrative expenses. (GX 4; GX 5.)
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy.  SOR  ¶¶  1.b-1.ll  allege  debts
reflected in Applicant’s credit reports from April 2017 (GX 2) and June 2018 (GX 3) and
totaling about $40,000. The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.i through 1.kk are medical debts
totaling  about  $2,000.  The  evidence  pertaining  to  the  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  is
summarized below.

otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
SOR  ¶  1.e:  student  loan  placed  for  collection  of  $3,801.  Applicant  incurred

SOR  ¶  1.f:  credit-card  account  past  due  for  $2,692.  The  last  activity  on  this

this debt in January through July 2016. She has taken no action to resolve it. (Tr. 29.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.i-1.n, 1.p, 1.s, and 1.t: medical bills in various amounts. Applicant
testified  that  she  believed  these  bills  were  covered  by  Medicaid.  She  contacted  the
creditors and gave them her Medicaid account number, but she did not know  whether
the  creditors  submitted  any  of  the  bills  to  Medicaid.  She  has  not  contacted  these
creditors  since  March  2017,  has  not  made  any  payments  on  these  bills,  and  has  not
filed disputes with the credit bureaus or taken any other action to resolve them. (Tr. 32-
34.)
SOR  ¶  1.o:  gym  membership  account  placed  for  collection  of  $947.
Applicant  was  uncertain  when  she  incurred  this  debt,  but  she  believed  it  was  in  2014.
She has taken no action to resolve it. (Tr. 33.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.q and 1.r: cellphone bills placed for collection of $520 and $416.
These bills were incurred at the same time for two different lines. Applicant has taken no
action to resolve them. (Tr. 33-34.)
SOR  ¶¶  1.u-1.kk:  various  medical  bills  placed  for  collection.  Applicant
testified that she disputed the debts online on the ground that the bills should have been
covered  by  Medicaid.  (Tr.  35.)  The  debts  are  not  reflected  in  her  March  2019  credit
report. (AX A.) They are resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.ll:  past-due  rent  placed  for  collection  of  $4,478.  Applicant  testified
that she contacted the creditor in early 2018 and disputed the amount due. She testified
that  she  owed  rent  for  two  months,  totaling  $1,600,  but  the  creditor  claimed  that  she
owed  more  because  of  trash  in  the  apartment.  (Tr.  49.)  She  testified  that  the  creditor
would not accept less than the full amount. (Tr. 49-50.) Applicant lived in this apartment
until  June  2018,  when  she  moved  into  a  house  that  she  inherited  from  her  father. (Tr.
38-39.)  She  has  not  made  any  payments,  established  a  payment  plan,  filed  a  dispute
with the credit bureaus, or taken any other action to resolve this debt.
Applicant earns between $1,000 and $1,200 per month, depending on how many
hours she works. Her son receives $140 per month because his father is disabled.  She
has  no  savings  or  investment  accounts.  Her  medical  expenses  are  now  covered  by
Medicaid.  She  receives  no  child  support  from  the  fathers  of  her  two  children.  She  has
never  sought  or  received  financial  counseling,  other  than  what  was  required  for  her
Chapter  13  bankruptcy.  She  suffers  from  diabetes  and  chronic  migraines,  which  are
sometimes severe enough to keep her from going to work. (Tr. 39-46)
