Applicant is a 61-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor. He will
be  hired  if  he  receives  a  security  clearance.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree  from  a
Lebanese  university  and  a  master’s  degree  from  a  university  in  the  United  States.  He
married in 1989 and divorced in 2017. He has three children. (Tr. at 23, 26-27, 34; GE
1-4)
Applicant was born in Sudan to Sudanese parents. He came to the United States
on  a  student  visa  in  1989.  He  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  1995.  His  ex-wife  is  a  native-
born U.S. citizen. His children were born in the United States. (Tr. at 27; GE 1-3)
Applicant  parents  are  deceased.  His  five  siblings  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Sudan.  None  of  his  family  members  have  any  direct  connection  to  the  Sudanese
government. He provided some financial support to his family in Sudan when he had the
means to do so. He last visited his family in Sudan in 2014. He communicates with his
family in Sudan through electronic media. He inherited some property in Sudan with his
siblings after his father passed away, but he thought his siblings sold the property.  He
does not own any other property in Sudan. He owned a home in the United States, but
his ex-wife received it in their divorce. He credibly testified that he is loyal to the United
States, and that his family in Sudan could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into
revealing classified information. (Tr. at 25-26, 35-36, 50-57; GE 1-4)
Applicant worked under dangerous conditions as a linguist in support of the U.S.
mission  in  Iraq  from  about  2004  until  2013.  He  held  a  security  clearance  at  the  time.
Like the U.S. military forces he supported, he came under fire. He submitted documents
and  a  letter  from  U.S.  military  and  other  personnel  attesting  to  his  excellent  job
performance while at risk to his own safety. (Tr. at 20-21, 28-29; GE 1-3; AE A)
Applicant  was  unemployed  from  about  February  2013  through  November  2013
and November 2015 until at least October 2017. He also went through extended periods
of underemployment, and he was unemployed as of the hearing date. He indicated that
his ex-wife did not pay all their bills while he was working overseas, and his divorce also
contributed to his financial difficulties. He was unable to pay all his bills, and a number
of debts became delinquent. (Tr. at 21-22, 29-34, 44-48; Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 1, 2)
The  SOR  alleges  seven  delinquent  debts  totaling  $11,062.  Four  of  the  debts,
totaling  $3,362,  are  defaulted  student  loans.  The  allegations  are  established  through
credit reports and Applicant’s admissions.
Applicant’s credit reports indicate that he took out six student loans in 2001 and
2002.  The  high  credit  on  those  six  loans  totaled  more  than  $81,000.  Two  loans,  with
high credit totaling about $45,000, appear to have been paid off in 2011. The remaining
four loans are the loans alleged in the SOR. The high credit on those four loans totaled
more  $40,000.  Because  of  interest,  the  high  credit  amounts  could  be  more  than  the
amount that was actually borrowed. As indicated in the SOR and the most recent credit
reports, the balances on the four loans were paid down to a total of  $3,362. Applicant
testified  that  he  was  in  recent  contact  with  the  creditor  handling  his  student  loans.  He
stated that his income tax refund was withheld to pay his student loans, and the balance
due on the loans is now about $2,600. The creditor will settle the debt for $2,050 if it is
paid within 90 days. (Tr. at 40-41, 50-51; GE 5-7)
Applicant contracted with a nonprofit debt-management organization in July 2019
to  assist  him  in  resolving  his  debts.  He  agreed  to  pay  $110  per  month,  which  will  be
used to pay his debts. He stated that within a few months of getting his job and working
overseas,  he  will  easily  be  able  to  pay  his  delinquent  debts  and  student  loans.  He
credibly testified that he will do so. (Tr. at 24-25, 36-43, 49; AE-B)
