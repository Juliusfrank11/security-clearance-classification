Applicant  is  59  years  old,  single,  and  has  no  children.  He  lives  with  his  mother
and is her primary caregiver. Applicant received a high school diploma in 1978 and has
attended approximately three years of college. He served in the U.S. Navy (USN) from
1986  until  1992,  when  he  was  honorably  discharged.  Applicant  also  actively  drilled  in
the U.S. Navy Reserve (USNR) in 1995. (GE 1 at 16; GE 2 at 23-24; GE 3 at 4; AE A;
Tr. 10-15, 21-23)
Applicant held a secret security clearance when he served on active duty in the
USN. He has worked for defense contractors since 2005, and he has held a clearance
since  2007.  He  currently  works  casually  for  a  defense  contractor  as  an  electrician
technologist and requires a clearance for his continued employment. (GE 1; GE 2; GE
3; AE A; Tr. 10-15, 21-23)
Applicant  started  using  marijuana  in  1977  while  he  was  in  high  school.  (Tr. 26)
From 1980 until he joined the USN in 1986, he used marijuana once every two to three
months. He did not use marijuana again until he left active duty in 1992. (Tr. 26) After
he was discharged from the USN, Applicant returned to his family’s farm and resumed
using  marijuana  socially  with  friends.  From  1992  until  1995,  he  was  in  the  USN’s
individual ready reserve (IRR), and he was not required to drill or take urinalysis tests.
(GE 3 at 8; Tr. 26, 27-30)
In  June  1995,  shortly  after  Applicant  joined  the  USNR,  he  took  a  random
urinalysis, which tested positive for marijuana. As a result of the positive test, Applicant
was  discharged  from  the  USNR  with  an  other  than  honorable  discharge  (OTH).  He
testified  that  he  never  received  the  discharge  paperwork  from  the  USN;  therefore,  he
was unaware that he received an OTH discharge. However, at the hearing, he admitted
that he was ashamed of his positive urinalysis, and he did not investigate or request the
discharge paperwork from the USNR. (Answer; GE 3 at 8; GE 4; Tr. 27-29)
Applicant  continued  to  use  marijuana  after  his  1995  discharge  from  the  USNR,
and  he  was  arrested for possession  of marijuana  in  2000  or  2001 and fined.  (GE  1  at
42; GE 2 at 28; GE 3 at 7-8; Tr. 31, 53) As stated above, Applicant started working for
defense contractors in 2005. After he received a clearance in 2007, he continued to use
marijuana.  In  2008  and  2010,  Applicant  changed  employers  but  continued  to  work  for
defense contractors and maintained a security clearance. (HE I; Tr. 32-33)
Throughout  his  time  working  for  defense  contractors,  Applicant  has  worked  for
extended  periods  in  various  locations  overseas  and  within  the  United  States.  He
testified that while working at these temporary locations, he did not use marijuana, and
his use was only  when he was home and near his friends. Applicant continued to use
marijuana  socially  despite  being  aware  of  the  federal  laws  and  his  various  employers’
policies regarding drug use while holding a clearance. (Answer; GE 1 at 9; GE 3 at 2-3,
8; Tr. 13, 31-34, 37, 42, 44-47)
Applicant  testified  that  he  stopped  using  marijuana  in  2014  due  to  a  scare
associated  with  a  work-related  urinalysis  before  a  deployment  to  Pakistan.  He  did  not
test  positive  for marijuana  and  “fell  through  the  cracks.”  He  admitted  that  this  was  the
only  urinalysis  he  had  taken  since  1995,  other  than  a  pre-employment  urinalysis  for  a
previous employer. (HE I; Tr. 39-44, 49)
Prior  to  the  hearing,  Applicant  reported  his  marijuana  use  in  a  November  2007
SCA,  a  July  2007  SCA,  and  in  an  October  2017  personal  subject  interview  (PSI).
Applicant was inconsistent in his reporting of his marijuana use. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3)
In his November 2007 SCA, Applicant reported that he used marijuana 10 to 15
times between 1994 and 2001. At the hearing, he claimed that he was not trying to be
deceptive in the 2007 SCA. He testified that his failure to disclose the full extent of his
drug use in the 2007 SCA was the result of potential mental fatigue or misinterpretation
of the relevant questions. (HE I; GE 2 at 29; Tr. 34, 36-38)
The  following  colloquy  occurred  during  the  hearing  regarding  Applicant’s
disclosure of drug use in his 2007 SCA:
AJ: Do you think you minimized the number of times you used [marijuana]?
Applicant: I downplayed it. Really I don’t know how many times I’ve used
[marijuana].  I  never  thought  I  had  problem  other  than  the  fact  that  I,  you
know, I think I stated this that my problem was taking this too lightly. And
thinking there was at time and place when it wasn’t bad. (Tr. 38)
In his July 2017 SCA, Applicant reported that he used marijuana 25 to 30 times
between 1980 and 2014. At the hearing that he claimed he forgot what he had reported
in  his  2007  SCA  regarding  his  drug  use  but  was  not  trying  to  be  deceptive.  He  also
admitted  during  questioning  that  his  use  of  marijuana  was  “closer  to  100  times  then
closer to 25.” (GE 1 at 43-44; HE I; Tr. 35, 39, 54-55)
In  his October  2017  PSI,  Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  he  used  marijuana
one time in 1977; he used marijuana once every two to three months between 1980 and
1986; he did not smoke marijuana between 1986 and 1992 while he was on active duty
in the U.S. Navy; he used marijuana two to three times a year between 1992 and 2010;
and he used marijuana fifteen times between 2010 and 2014. (GE 3 at 8; Tr. 26, 35-36,
39)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  did  not  disclose  to  his  current  and
former  employers  and  facility  security  officers  that  he  used  marijuana  while  holding  a
security clearance. (Tr. 49-50) In his response to the SOR amendment, Applicant wrote,
“During  the  process  of  background  questionnaires  and  interviews  I  did  not  want  to
appear  to  have  a  problem  with  marijuana,  but  I’m  basically  very  honest.  I  understated
the frequency of marijuana use.” He acknowledged that he used to have a problem with
marijuana,  but  he  has  never  sought  treatment  or  counseling  related  to  his  marijuana
use. (HE I; Tr. 52-53)
Applicant  submitted  an  October  7,  2018  statement  of  intent  to  abstain  from  the
use of drugs and testified that he intends to abstain from using marijuana in the future.
(AE B; Tr. 49) At the hearing, Applicant testified that his drug use was immature, he is a
changed  person,  and  he  regrets  using  marijuana  as  an  adult.  At  this  point  he
infrequently sees his friends with whom he used marijuana.  (Answer; HE I; Tr. 17, 38,
48)
Applicant  received  the  following  awards  and  decorations  when  he  was
discharged  from  active  duty  in  1992:  Good  Conduct  Medal;  Humanitarian  Service
Medal;  Southwest  Asia  Service  Medal  with  bronze  star;  National  Defense  Service
Medal;  Sea  Service  Deployment  Ribbon;  and  Joint  Meritorious  Unit  Sward  with  oak
cluster. (AE A; Tr. 15, 18-20)
