Under  Guideline  F,  the  Government alleged Applicant  did  not file her federal  or
state income tax returns on time for the 2014 and 2015 tax years (SOR 1.a). In response,
Applicant admitted the allegation. (Answer) Additionally, Applicant disclosed in her e-QIP
that she had not yet filed her federal and state income tax returns for the 2014 tax year.
(GX 1)
In addition to the facts thus established, I make the following additional findings of
fact. Applicant is 34 years old and works as an aerospace engineer for a large corporation
in support of a federal contract. She obtained her bachelor’s degree in May 2007. She
was  hired  by  her  current  employer  in  April  2008.  At  that  time,  she  lived  in  State  A.  In
January  2008,  she  transferred  to  State  B,  where  her  family  lives.  In  2014,  Applicant
transferred to State C. (GX 1)
In 2013, while living in State B, Applicant helped her family set up and run a small
business unrelated to her  work  as  an  engineer.  Applicant  was  a named partner  in  the
business, which was organized as a Subchapter S corporation. Her role in the business
was  as  a  bookkeeper,  to  include  making  sure  taxes  were  filed  properly.  As  a  named
partner, she received a modest flow-through income she was required to report on her
personal  income  tax  returns  along  with  her  full-time  income  as  an  engineer.  When
Applicant transferred to State C, she could no longer help with bookkeeping and tax duties
for her family’s business. Unfortunately, her family was not very well organized in such
matters. This impacted Applicant’s ability to file her income tax returns for 2014 and 2015
because  she  could  not  obtain  the  paperwork  needed  to  correctly  file  her  personal  tax

returns.  This  circumstance  continued  through  the  2015  tax  year,  when  the  business
closed. (GX 2; Tr. 25 – 29, 32)
Applicant  has  since  been  able  to  file  her  2014  and  2015  federal  and  state  tax
returns.  She  filed  her  2014  return  in  February  2017  and  paid  the  resulting  taxes  with
interest and penalties at that time. She was unable to file her 2015 returns until November
2018. She owes $14,607 for federal taxes and $2,300 for state taxes from 2015. Applicant
has  sufficient  funds  in  her  retirement  savings  with  which  to  satisfy  both  accounts;
however,  she  is  waiting  to  hear  from  the  IRS  and  State  C  tax  authority  regarding
repayment options before she decides how to resolve her 2015 taxes. Her income and
personal finances are otherwise sound, and she has sufficient resources to satisfy any
reasonable repayment plan. (AX A – D; Tr. 29 – 30, 33 – 35)
The  record  does  not  reflect  any  other  financial  problems.  Applicant  has  been
working  to  resolve  her  late  filing  status  since  well  before  the  SOR  was  issued,  and
otherwise has always filed her income tax returns as required. (GX 2)
