Applicant  is  a  46-year-old  principal  engineer  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since  January  2018.  (Item  3)  He  seeks  a  security  clearance  in  conjunction  with  his
current employment.
Applicant  earned  his bachelor’s  degree  in  May  1996.  He married  in  June  1999,
and has two minor children. (Item 3)
Financial Considerations
The  SOR  alleges  eight  delinquent  consumer  accounts  totaling  $75,963.  In  his
SOR Answer, Applicant admits each of the debts. These debts are further established
by  his  March  2018  credit  report,  as  well  as  by  his  Office  of  Personnel  Management
Personal  Subject  Interview  (OPM  PSI)  conducted  in  June  2018.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  –  1.h.;
Items 1, 2, 4, 5)
In  Applicant’s  SOR  Answer,  he  states  these  debts  arose  after  he  used  his
personal credit cards to fund a start-up company that he created with another individual.
When that individual died unexpectedly in June 2017, the company dissolved. Applicant
explained that at the time of his partner’s death, the business was working on a medical
product.  Applicant  states,  “[w]hen/if  [he]  is able  to produce this product  again,  [he]  will
pay these debts through that business.” (Items 2, 6)
As noted, the debts alleged are supported by his March 2018 credit report, which
reflects  that  the  accounts  became  delinquent  in  mid-2017.  Applicant  reported  one
delinquent  debt  in  his February  2018  SF-86.  He  described  the  debt  as  an  “unsecured
credit  card,”  which  he  estimated  at  $20,000,  and  reported  this  debt  was  the  result  of
“reduced income.” He also reported that he was “discussing a lump sum payoff with the
creditor” and estimated May 2017 as the date the financial issue began. (Item 3)
Department  Counsel’s  FORM  discussed  specific  shortcomings  of  Applicant’s
SOR answer, and emphasized long-standing DOHA case law concerning the necessity
for applicants to provide mitigating documentation. Applicant’s SOR Answer and FORM
Response contained no documentation that addressed his SOR debts.
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (EO)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive
