Applicant  is  51  years  old.  He  was  married  in  2005  and  divorced  in  2010.  He
married  again  in  December  2013,  and  he  has  a  two-year-old  son.  (GE  1,  Tr.  28,  35)
Applicant was born, raised, and educated in the U.S. He was employed in information
technology  by  a  federal  contractor  in  Iraq  from  2004  to  2013.  (Tr.  54)  He  has  been
employed  as  a  senior  contracts  administrator  for  a  federal  contractor  since  February
2017. (Tr. 51) He met his current wife in 2013 while she was working as a contractor for
the  United  States  (U.S.)  from  2012  to  2014.  (Tr.  43)  She  was  born  in  Egypt  and  is  a
1 Unless otherwise stated, the basis for these findings of fact is Applicant’s security clearance application
(SCA)  dated  April  5,  2017  (GE  1)  and  the  summaries  of  personal  subject  interviews  conducted  on

dual citizen of Egypt and Iraq.  Applicant’s foreign-born wife and family present security
concerns for him.
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on April 5, 2017.2 In section
18 (Relatives) and section 19 (Foreign Contacts) of his SCA, he disclosed his wife, her
parents,  and  siblings,  as  dual  citizens  of  Iraq  (paternal)  and  Egypt  (maternal)  and
currently residing in Egypt. His wife has one sister, age 23, and two brothers, ages 26,
and 29. (Tr. 13) Although Applicant’s wife and her siblings were born in Egypt, they are
considered dual residents of Egypt and Iraq since their father was an Iraqi. His children
acquired  Iraqi  citizenship  by  default.  (Tr. 31-32)  In  2001, her entire family  moved from
Egypt to Iraq to be with her father’s extended family. (Tr. 43) They remained in Iraq for
13  years.  After  college,  Applicant’s  wife  moved  with  her  family  back  to  Egypt  in  2014
due  to  deteriorating  conditions  in  Iraq.  (Tr.  32-33)  They  maintain  no  ties  to  Iraq  and
have no desire to return to that war-ravaged country. (Tr. 33)
Applicant testified credibly that his wife could not find a job in Iraq after obtaining
her college degree because her mother was an Egyptian and her family were Shia. (Tr.
33)  They  faced  discrimination  in  Iraq.  She  obtained  work  in  the  Green  Zone  in  Iraq
where  she  met  Applicant  near  the  U.S.  Embassy.  Applicant  finished  his  assignment
overseeing contracts and left Iraq in 2013, but returned a few months later to marry his
wife  in  December  2013.  (Tr.  35)  He  waited  so  there  would  be  no  conflict  of  interest.
Applicant met her family, whom he described as modern, secular, and non-political. (Tr.
38)  Her  parents  are  elderly  and  do  not  speak  English.  They  have  no  ties  to  the
government of Iraq or Egypt. Applicant and his wife moved to the U.S. in 2014. She has
a green card and expects to be naturalized as a U.S. citizen in about one year. (Tr. 38)
Applicant’s wife’s two brothers were college educated in Baghdad, and her sister
was college educated in Egypt. (Tr. 41) His wife and her two brothers all worked on a
U.S. military installation in Iraq from 2012 to 2014, and all completed questionnaires for
national security positions, and were vetted by either the U.S. DOD or U.S. Department
of State (DOS) to work in Iraq for a major U.S. contractor. (Tr. 21-24) Applicant provided
copies  of  their  U.S.-issued  security  badges  allowing  access  to  the  installation.  (AE
B,C,E,F)  Applicant’s  wife  was  an  administrative  assistant.  Her  brother  was  a  network
administrator with unfettered access to U.S. computer systems. (Tr. 23-24)
Applicant testified credibly that while his wife loves her parents and siblings, his
relationship with them is cordial, but not like family. Her parents are elderly and retired.
(Tr.  46)  His  wife  contacts  her  parents  via  an  application  known  as  WhatsApp
approximately  every  few  days.  (Tr.  44)  She  uses  the  same  application  to  contact  her
sister  every  two  weeks,  and  her  brothers  about  once  a  month.  (Tr.  45)  His  wife  is  a
homemaker and mother devoted to her family in the U.S. Her brothers are employed in
data  processing  and  telemarketing  in  Egypt.  (Tr.  47)  They  face  prejudice  in  Egypt
because their father is Iraqi. (Tr. 47) Applicant’s wife last visited her parents in Egypt in
2015. (Tr. 48) The parents’ apartment there will likely be inherited by her brothers. (Tr.
49) Nobody in his wife’s family knows what Applicant does for work.
