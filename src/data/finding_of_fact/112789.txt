Applicant  admitted  to  both  allegations  of  the  SOR,  ¶¶  1.a,  and  1.b.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  39-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  “for  over  14  years.”  (TR  at  page  12  line  20  to
page 16 line 16.) He is married, and attributes his alleged financial difficulties to his wife
losing her job. (TR at page 30 line 23 to page 31 line 5, and at page 36 lines 1~16.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a. Applicant admitted a past-due student loan debt to Creditor A in the amount
of about $20,388. He mistakenly thought this private student loan, along with his other
student loans, was deferred. (TR at page 17 line 4 to page 29 line 20.) This debt “has
been  settled,”  with  a  current  “Balance:  $0.00,”  as  evidenced  by  correspondence  from
Creditor A. (AppX B.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.b.  Applicant  admitted  past-due  auto  loan  debt  to  Creditor  B  in  the  amount  of
about $10,013. He mistakenly though this debt was covered by his gap insurance when
his vehicle was voluntarily repossessed. (TR at page 30 line 1 to page 35 line 15, and at
page  39  lines  1~15.)  This  debt  has  been  settled  for  $5,000,  as  evidenced  by
correspondence from Creditor B. (AppX C.) Furthermore, this debt does not appear on
Applicant’s most recent April 2019 credit reports. (AppX A.) This allegation is also found
for Applicant.
