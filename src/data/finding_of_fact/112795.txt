In his SOR response, Applicant admitted that he failed to file his 2014-2017 federal
and state taxes as required (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b). I have incorporated his admissions in
my findings of fact. Applicant’s personal information is extracted from GE 1, his security
clearance  application,  dated  August  3,  2017,  (SCA)  unless  otherwise  indicated  by  a
parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,
Applicant’s testimony at the hearing, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant,  67,  has  worked  as  an  engineer  for  a  defense  contractor  since  June
2017. Prior to that, he was unemployed since 2011, except for two temporary, low-paying
jobs. He earned a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering in 1975. He held a secret
clearance from 1986 to 1991 when he was an employee of a defense contractor. He has
never married and has one child (age17). (Tr. 11, 12, 23, 24, 25-26.)
In his SOR response, Applicant admitted that he failed to file federal and state tax
returns in 2014 through 2017. He wrote that this was due to the fact that he believed he
owed taxes and could not afford to pay them. He was struggling with his unemployment
and was scared. At the hearing he admitted that he did the worst thing he could do, which
was nothing. He subsequently determined that he did, in fact, file his federal tax return for
2014 as required, and he provided a copy of that return as evidence. It reflects a filing
date of April 13, 2015, and that he was due to receive a refund of $1,339. The status of
his 2014 state tax return is unclear. He also wrote in his SOR response that he was in the
process of preparing his delinquent returns, starting with the most recent year, 2018. The
SOR does not allege that he failed to file his 2018 federal and state returns as required.
(Tr. 31; AE C, D, G.)
At the hearing, Applicant submitted copies of his 2018 and 2017 federal and state
tax returns, dated August 1 and 8, 2019, shortly before the hearing date. If he had filed
for an extension in 2018 and his federal and state returns and tax payments would have
been due on October 15, 2019. He testified that he did not file for an extension, though a
letter from his tax preparer suggests that he did. (SOR response; AE C, D, H; AE E at 45-
46; Tr. 28-29, 47.)
The  remaining  security  concerns  under  the  SOR  allegations  were  Applicant’s
federal and state tax returns for 2015 and 2016. On September 11, 2019, he submitted
copies of the first two pages of his 2015 and 2016 federal tax returns. Both returns reflect
that he owed no taxes. He noted in his email that the returns were not yet filed and would
only be released by the tax preparer for filing once he paid the preparer’s fee, which he
said would “be in a few days.” He never communicated or documented after the hearing
that these two returns had been filed. (AE H.)
Even though Appellant incorrectly disclosed in his SCA that he owed federal and
state income taxes for 2015 and 2016, the SOR does not allege that he failed to pay his
federal and state taxes as required. In his SOR response, he volunteered that he was in
the  process  of  obtaining  a  home  equity  loan  to  pay  his  delinquent  taxes.  As  noted,
Applicant’s federal tax returns for the years 2015 and 2016 reflect he owes no income
taxes in those years.
Applicant’s  2017  and  2018  federal  tax  returns  reflect  that  he  owes  $340  and
$7,161, respectively. His state returns reflect that he is due a refund for 2017 of $444 and
owes $2,679 for 2018. He also volunteered a document from the state tax authority, dated
March 20, 2019, notifying him that it was garnishing his wages to pay a tax debt of $6,364
for  the  year  2016.  The  notice  predates  Applicant’s  filing  of  his  state  tax  return  for  that
year, so the amount due is merely an estimate by the state and may change since he was
unemployed in 2016. (SOR response; AE E at 2, 11, 22, 35, 43, 45-47; AE F at 3; Tr. 32,
35, 43-45, 53.)
At  the  time  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  was  in the final stage  of  obtaining  a  home
equity line of credit (HELOC) in the amount of $75,000. He submitted at the hearing the
lender’s conditional approval letter, dated as of August 7, 2019. In an email dated August
28, 2019, he wrote that he expected to receive the loan proceeds in about a month. He
wrote  further  that  he  intends  to  pay  his  past  due  taxes  to  the  IRS  and  the  state  tax
authority once the HELOC loan is finalized. After the hearing, Applicant advised that he
did not qualify for the HELOC. (AE B, AE G at 1; Tr. 52-60; Hearing Ex. 3 at 4.)
During  his  extended  period  of  unemployment,  Applicant  maintained  financial
stability.  Presently,  he  is  earning  about  $20,000  in  annual  income  less  than  he  did  in
2011, but is able to pay his bills. He has no delinquent consumer debt and has only one
credit  card  with  a  relatively  small  balance.  His  vehicle  was  paid  off  in  2010.  He  has
retirement accounts worth about $600,000. It appears that Applicant is unwilling to pay
his tax debts with funds from these accounts. While unemployed in 2015, he refinanced
his home mortgage with a 15-year mortgage in the amount of $159,000. The mortgage
loan has a current balance of about $125,000. He supported himself during his years of
unemployment by selling assets in his personal investment account at the rate of about
$75,000 per year for several years. He no longer has those assets, but it is clear from his
testimony that he manages his finances very conservatively. He loves his job and would
like  to  continue  working  there  for  as  long  as  possible.  He  wants  to  do  something
meaningful with his life and his current position is a good place for him to do so. He had
intended to pay for his share of his child’s college expenses with assets he has invested
over  the  years  in  a  special  college  investment  account  and  with  borrowing  from  the
HELOC. It is very important to Applicant that his child have the opportunity to attend and
complete college. (GE 3 at 5, 8; GE 4 at 3, 4; Tr. 11-16, 36-37, 49-51; Hearing Ex. 3 at 1-
3.)
Applicant submitted a personal reference from a long-time friend and former work
colleague.  The  friend  wrote  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  protecting  his  employer’s
secrets and that despite his financial challenges due to his unemployment, he behaved
responsibly during that prolonged period by reducing his expense while also providing for
his child. (AE I at 2.)
