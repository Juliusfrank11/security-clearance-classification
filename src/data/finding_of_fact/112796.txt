2014,  for  $161,857;  in  2013,  for  $161,133;  in  2003,  for  $154,534;  and  in  2005,  for
$51,092. Applicant’s October 28, 2017 combined credit report from three credit reporting
companies showed the two federal tax liens for $161,857 and $161,833. (GE 4 at 2-3)
The two federal tax liens for $154,534 and $51,092 were shown in LexisNexis but not in
the October 28, 2017 combined credit report. (GE 5; GE 6)
SOR ¶¶ 1.e through 1.h allege that state government S filed tax liens as follows:
in 2002, for $10,987; in 2003, for $10,693; in 2003, for $17,357; and in 2003, for $11,424.
The four tax liens were shown in LexisNexis. (GE 7-GE 10) SOR ¶ 1.i alleges that state
government  M1  filed  a  state  tax  lien  in  2007  for  $13,191.  The  tax  lien  was  shown  in
LexisNexis. (GE 11)
The federal and state tax lien documentation in the file do not include information
about which tax years resulted in the delinquent taxes in the liens.

In  response to  DOHA inquiries  about  his state  taxes,  Applicant  wrote  that there
were no state taxes in state T. (GE 2) He did not say anything about state taxes owed in
state S or M1. (GE 2)
The IRS tax transcript for tax year 2011 indicated “RETURN NOT PRESENT FOR
THIS ACCOUNT.” (GE 2 at 4) The SOR did not allege that he failed to file his 2011 federal
income tax return, and this discrepancy is not being considered as a disqualifying fact in
Applicant’s case. Applicant’s claimed income, which is not part of the record, might have
been too low to necessitate filing a federal income tax return.
Applicant’s IRS tax transcript dated March 6, 2019, indicates for tax year 1999, he
did not pay any taxes until December 6, 2004, when he paid $5,058. In 2013, the IRS
determined  the  tax  for  tax  year  1999  was  uncollectable,  and  in  2013,  the  lien  was
removed. (AE B) On June 9, 2014, the IRS wrote off the $57,127 balance due, and his
tax transcript indicates the current balance owed is zero. (AE B)
Applicant’s tax transcript dated March 6, 2019, indicates for tax year 2002, the IRS
filed a substitute return on December 1, 2003, and the only payment made was a transfer
from tax year 2012 of $517. (AE B) The IRS filed liens in 2013 and 2014 seeking collection
for  tax  year  2002.  (AE  B)  In  2014,  the  IRS  wrote  off  the  $56,302  balance  owed  and
removed the liens. (AE B) Applicant agreed with Department Counsel’s statement that he
previously owed more than $300,000 in federal taxes, and he paid nothing to address his
delinquent tax debt. (Tr. 35) Applicant did not submit tax transcripts for several tax years,
and tax transcripts would have been helpful for a more complete understanding of how
most of his federal income tax debt was generated.
Applicant attributed his initial tax problems to unemployment, inability to pay, and
letting things “get out of hand.” (Tr. 33-34) Applicant said his annual income was about
$23,000, and in 2018, it was about $30,000. (Tr. 29) He did not specify the year in which
his annual income was $23,000. He was employed during the previous 10 years. (Tr. 29)
He estimated he drove about eight or nine months of the year, and about two to five days
a week. (Tr. 44) He is paid based on the miles he drives. (Tr. 44) The IRS did not audit
his income taxes. (Tr. 32) At his hearing, Applicant insisted that he honestly reported and
did not underreport his income to the IRS. (Tr. 36, 52)
Applicant pays his cohabitant $250 a month for rent. (Tr. 30) He has less than $400
in  his  checking  and  savings  accounts.  (Tr.  30)  He  does  not  have  a  401(k)  retirement
account. (Tr. 30-31) He did not receive financial counseling. (Tr. 38)
Applicant  provided  a  March  26,  2019  letter  from  a  debt  resolution  firm  stating
Applicant’s past due liabilities from the IRS, state M1, and state S were resolved. (SOR
response) Applicant’s October 2018,  Equifax,  TransUnion, and  Experian  credit  reports
did not indicate any tax liens. (SOR response)
Applicant admitted that he had several tax liens from state S and one from state
M1. (Tr. 38-39) Applicant  said some of them could be duplications because they were
filed the same year. (Tr. 39) Applicant said he called state S and state M1 tax authorities
about  two  months  before  his  hearing,  and  he  learned  state  S  wanted  a  total  of  about
$57,000 and state M1 wanted about $8,000. (Tr. 39, 41) The four state S tax liens in ¶¶
1.e through 1.h total $50,461. He did not provide proof that any of the State S tax liens
were duplications. He conceded the March 26, 2019 letter from a debt resolution firm was
incorrect about resolution of the state tax liens. (Tr. 40, 47) He learned that generally his
debt resolution firm does not resolve or address state tax problems. (Tr. 48) He said he
had been making payments of unspecified amounts to states M1 and S every year for the
last 10 or 15 years; however, he did not provide proof of such payments. (Tr. 46)
