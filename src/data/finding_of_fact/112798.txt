Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR with explanations, except ¶ 1.i,
which she denied. Her admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review
of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 63 years old. She  is  a  retired federal employee currently seeking a
position with a federal contractor. She is single, twice divorced, with three adult children.
She achieved her GED in 1985 and has taken some college courses.1
The SOR alleged Applicant filed for Chapter 7  bankruptcy in 1991 (discharged);
Chapter  7  in  2002  (discharged);  Chapter  13  in  2009  (dismissed);  Chapter  7  in  2012
(discharged);  and  Chapter  13  in  2014  (dismissed)  (¶¶  1.a-1.e).  The  SOR  also  alleged
she  was  delinquent  on  her  federal  income  taxes  in  the  amount  of  $18,717  for  years
2010  and  2014-2016,  and  state  income  taxes  in  the  amount  of  $4,754  (¶¶  1.f-1.g).  It
further  alleged  she  owed  on  six  delinquent  collection  accounts  in  the  total  amount  of
approximately $18,868. These accounts are comprised of a medical bill, utility debt, an
apartment  debt,  a  repossessed  car  debt,  and  consumer  debt.  The  allegations  are
supported by credit reports from April 2018 and October 2018, Applicant’s statement to
a  defense  investigator  in  May  2018,  various  bankruptcy  filings,  and  Applicant’s  SOR
admissions.2
Applicant  claimed  financial  hardship  when  she  retired  from  her  government
position in 2017 and had to wait several months before she began receiving retired pay.
She documented this delay. There is no evidence of financial counseling.3
Bankruptcies. Applicant filed  Chapter 7  bankruptcies  and was discharged from
her debts in 1991, 2002, and 2013 as a result of those proceedings. In 2009 and 2014
Applicant  filed  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  petitions.  Both  those  actions  were  dismissed.
There is no information as to the reason the 2009 petition was dismissed, but the 2014
petition was dismissed in 2017 for failure to make three months of payments under the
bankruptcy  plan.  While  Applicant  was  a  federal  employee  she  had  $197.50  deducted

from  her  paycheck  twice  a  month.  From  September  2014  until  March  2017  she  paid
approximately $13,000 in plan payments before her petition was dismissed.4
Taxes. Applicant claims she entered into  a  payment agreement with the  IRS to
pay  her  federal  tax  debt.  As  proof  of  this  agreement, she  supplied  a  notice  letter  from
the IRS dated April 18, 2018. The notice indicated that she owed $18,717; that her last
payment  was  $0;  and  that  next  payment  of  $242  was  due  on  May  1,  2018.  Applicant
failed  to  provide  documentation  showing  that  she  has  made  any  payments  to  the  IRS
starting  in  May  2018.  As  for  her  state  taxes,  she  provided  an  installment  bill  from  her
taxing authority dated July 30, 2018, which indicated that she had a remaining balance
of $4,754 and her monthly payment of $96 was due on August 15, 2018. She failed to
provide  documentation  showing  that  she  made  her  monthly  payments  beginning  in
August 2018.5
Collection Accounts. SOR ¶ 1.h: In February 2019, the creditor offered to settle
this  debt  with  Applicant  for  approximately  $1,600  with  monthly  payments  of  $75.
Applicant failed to document that she accepted the offer or made any payments. SOR ¶
1.i:  Applicant  disputes  this  utility  debt.  She  claims  she  was  serviced  by  another
company  at  the  time  of  this  alleged  debt.  She  formally  disputed  this  debt  through  a
credit  reporting  service.  SOR  ¶  1.j:  Applicant  documented  that  this  medical  debt  was
paid  in  August  2016.  SOR  ¶  1.k:  Applicant  claims  this  debt  was  included  in  her  2014
Chapter 13 bankruptcy and she was making her required payments until the case was
dismissed.  She  did  not  provide  documentation  showing  any  payments  since  the
Chapter  13  dismissal.  SOR  ¶  1.l:  Applicant  claims  her  payment  on  this  debt  was
affected by not timely receiving her retirement payments. She claims she will make $20
monthly  payments  on  this  account,  but  she  failed  to  document  any  payments  so  far.
SOR  ¶  1.m:  Applicant  claims  her  payment  on  this  debt  was  affected  by  not  timely
receiving her retirement payments. She claims she will make $10 monthly payments on
this account, but she failed to document any payments so far.6
Character  Evidence.  Applicant  presented  statements  from  seven  co-workers
and colleagues. In her former government position, she occupied a position of trust as a
pretrial  services  officer.  Her  co-workers  recognized  her  as  a  professional  and
trustworthy employee. They noted her dedication to her job and her great integrity.
