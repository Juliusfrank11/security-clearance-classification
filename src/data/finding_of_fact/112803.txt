Applicant  is 55  years old.  He  was  born  in Afghanistan  in  1963.  He  received his
education while living in Afghanistan. In 1981, Applicant graduated from high school, and
in 1988, he received a certificate from a government college. After his father was killed
by  the  Pakistani  army,  he  fled  to  Pakistan  in  1989  because  he  did  not  want  to  be
conscripted into the Afghan army. He remained in Pakistan until 1992, when he entered
the United States as a refugee, along with his mother and siblings. He married an Afghan
citizen in 2006 while visiting Afghanistan. They divorced in 2009 in Afghanistan. He does
not  have  any  children.  He  became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  2006.  (Items  4,  7,  9)
Applicant’s five siblings are U.S. residents and naturalized citizens. (Item 7)
Applicant worked as a linguist for federal contractors in Afghanistan from March
2009  to  November  2009  and  March  2011  to  December  2012.  He  applied  for  another
linguist position in November 2017. He stated that he was granted a security clearance
in 2009. In between those positions, he worked in construction or as a driver in the United
States. He was also unemployed at times. (Items 3, 5, 8, 9)
Foreign Influence
Applicant admitted that his mother, age 86, is currently a citizen and resident of
Afghanistan. She has lived there since 2013. Prior to that, she lived in the United States
periodically after she immigrated in 1992. He contacts her twice a week. (Items 2, 9 at
21) In his answer to the SOR (Answer), Applicant denied that one of his brothers-in-law
is a citizen of Afghanistan. He stated that his brother-in-law recently moved to the United
States and lives with Applicant’s sister. He does not know his brother-in-law’s citizenship
status. There is no information regarding how often Applicant contacts him or confirmation
that his brother-in-law now lives in the U.S. (Item 2)
Applicant admitted in his Answer that he provides financial support for his mother,
extended  family,  and  friends.  He  sends  money  to  friends  to  maintain  his  family’s
residence in Afghanistan. His mother lives in that residence, which he estimated has a
value of $80,000. He denied that he supports his former wife, as he previously disclosed
in  his  2017  e-QIP.  (Items  2,  7,  9)  In  his  December  2017  Counterintelligence  Focused
Security  Screening  Questionnaire  (CFSSQ),  Applicant  stated  that  between  2009  and
2013,  he  sent  $500  to  his  cousin  and  also  to  a  friend  as  gifts.  He  sent  $6,300  to  his
brother-in-law  to  help  poor  citizens  and  pay  for  Applicant’s  father’s  medical  expenses
while he was alive. (Items 6, 8)
Personal Conduct
The SOR alleged that  Applicant has a history of arrests, falsifying his 2014 and
2017 e-QIPs, and engaging in misconduct related to his businesses. The allegations are
as follows:
(¶ 2.a) In 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with soliciting a prostitute. He
disclosed this information  in his March 2009  Screening  Questionnaire  (SQ).  He  stated
that he talked to a prostitute for a cousin, who could not speak English. He was convicted
and placed on probation for one year. (Item 7 at 7) In his Answer, he denied the allegation
and said he did not recall the incident. (Item 2)
(¶  2.b)  Applicant  denied  that  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  aggravated
harassment in November 2000. A state court record indicated that he pleaded guilty to
disorderly conduct and an order of protection was entered against him for one year. (Item
11)
(¶  2.c)  In  June  2002,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  aggravated
harassment, involving his previous girlfriend. He disclosed this information in his 2009 e-
QIP and noted that the charges were dismissed. He admitted this allegation in his Answer.
(Item 2, Item 3 at 39; Item 4 at 7)
(¶  2.d)  In  October  2008,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  assault.  He

admitted this allegation in his Answer. (Item 2, Item 3 at 38, Item 4 at 7)
(¶  2.e)  In  November  2009,  a  defense  contractor  terminated  Applicant’s
employment after they received an anonymous complaint that he was smoking hashish.
Applicant was working in the Middle East at that time. (Item 10) Applicant denied that he
was using hashish and said he was “framed” by others. (Item 2)
(¶  2.f)  In  December  2012,  another  defense  contractor  terminated  Applicant’s
employment after he tested positive for illegal drug use. (Item 10) Applicant denied that
he was terminated, but said he voluntarily left because his contract ended. (Item 7 at 20,
Item 8 at 3)
(¶ 2.g) In November 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged with obstructing
governmental  administration.  Applicant  denied  the  allegation.  A  court  document
confirmed that he was charged and the case was dismissed. (Item 11)
(¶ 2.h) In his Answer, Applicant stated he did not recall if he disclosed in his 2014
e-QIP his December 2012 termination for drug use, as alleged in SOR ¶ 2.f. He asserted
that  he  submitted  many  e-QIPs  and  other  documents  and  said  he  disclosed  that
information in some of them. He denied the allegation regarding his drug use. (Item 2) In
his 2014 CFSSQ, he explained that he had a conflict with another employee, who reported
him as using hashish. He said he was dismissed by his employer without being given a
drug test. (Item 6 at 2)
(¶  2.i)  Applicant  admitted  that  he  was  arrested  in  October  2008  and  November
2013, as alleged in SOR ¶¶ 2.d and 2.g. He said he did not disclose the arrests in his
2014 e-QIP because both cases were dismissed. He denied that he falsified his 2014 e-
QIP. (Item 2)
(¶  2.j)  During  his  January  2018  interview,  Applicant  stated  that  from  December
2014 until May 2016, he lived and worked in Afghanistan. He told the investigator that he
and  his  brother-in-law,  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Afghanistan,  started  a  business
partnership,  buying  gas  from  Iran  and  shipping  it  to  Afghanistan.  Applicant  said  he
registered the business in his brother-in-law’s name because  as a U.S. citizen he was
subject to U.S. sanctions and prohibited from doing business with Iran. (Item 9 at 18) In
his Answer, he denied any wrongdoing and asserted that he was unfamiliar with the U.S.
sanctions. (Item 2)
(¶  2.k)  In  his  2017  e-QIP,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  was  self-employed  as  a
homebuilder  in  the  United  States  from  January  2014  through  November  2017,  part  of
which time he claimed he lived in Afghanistan. (Item 7 at 18) During his January 2018
interview, he stated that he did not register his U.S. business with the state or report any
income  to  the  state  or  IRS.  (Item  9  at  2,  18)  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  denied  these
allegations, claiming he performed construction work as a hobby and not as a business.
(Item 2)
(¶ 2.l) In his 2017 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that for the past ten years he resided
in  the  United  States  from  October  2012  to  the  present  (December  2017).  He  failed  to
disclose that he had resided in Afghanistan from December 2014 through May 2016. In
his Answer, he denied that he falsified information about his residency. He said that either
he or the person interviewing him in 2018 did not correctly insert the information into the
e-QIP  or  other  documents.  (Item  2)  He  did  not  clarify  the  dates  of  his  residency  in
Afghanistan in his Answer.
(¶  2.m)  Applicant  admitted  that  he  did  not  disclose  in  his  2017  e-QIP  the  facts
alleged in SOR ¶ 2.f, relating to his job termination in December 2012 for using drugs. He
asserted  that  he  had  submitted  all  relevant  information  numerous  times  about  the
termination and his drug test, and stated that he did not falsify information in the e-QIP.
(Item 2)
(¶ 2.n) In his 2017 e-QIP, Applicant did not disclose that he had a business partner
or  associate  in  Afghanistan,  or  had  contacts  with  Iran  within  the  past  seven  years,  as
requested. He denied that he falsified his e-QIP because he claimed his brother-in-law
was not “an official business partner.” (Item 2)
(¶ 2.o) During the January 2018 interview, Applicant did not disclose that he had
an employment problem with his former employer in December 2012 and was terminated
for testing positive for drug use, as alleged in ¶ 2.f. He denied that he deliberately withheld

Afghanistan
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  facts  contained  in  U.S.  Government
pronouncements  concerning  the  state  of  Afghanistan.  Specifically,  Afghanistan  faces
many challenges fueled by sectarian and ethnic divisions. Numerous terrorist groups are
increasingly active throughout Afghanistan. Threats of kidnapping and violence are high,
and the Department of State warns U.S. citizens that all travel to Afghanistan should be
avoided.  Of  particular  significance  are  the  poor  human  rights  situation;  the  active  and
hostile presence of Al Qaida, the Taliban, the Haqqani Network; and other insurgent and
extremist groups that generate instability and openly attack police, security  and military
forces, the local populace, and U.S. persons and interests. (AE 1)
