Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegation.  He  is  a  24-year-old  systems  engineer
employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  August  2016.  This  is  his  first  real  job  after
graduating college in May 2016. He has not previously held a clearance.
During a May 2018 interview with a Government investigator (Item 3), Applicant
disclosed that he had used marijuana in October 2016 (vaporizer), August 2017 (pipe),
November  2017  (bong),  and  January  2018  (pipe)  each  time  in  social  settings  with
friends. He admitted to succumbing to peer pressure on each occasion, but stated that
marijuana  use  actually  makes  him  sick.  Moreover,  He  does  not  normally  smoke
because his grandparents died from lung cancer and he was training for a marathon. He
was  aware  that  marijuana  use  is  illegal,  and  is  also  inconsistent  with  holding  a
clearance. He stated that continuing to use marijuana was not worth risking his job, and
he had no intent to use marijuana in the future.
Applicant  disclosed  his  then-current  marijuana  use  on  his  September  2017
clearance  application  (Item  2).  At  the  time,  he  was  unwilling  to  commit  to  not  using
marijuana in the future. He disclosed his additional marijuana uses during his May 2018
interview.
In  his  November  2018  Answer  (Item  1),  Applicant  admitted  his  marijuana  use,
and  stated  that  he  no  longer  experiences  any  social  pressure  to  use  marijuana.  He
signed a statement of intent as contemplated by the AG.
Applicant submitted no work or character references, and provided no evidence
of any community involvement.
