Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR, except the allegation in ¶ 1.a,
which she partially denied due to the dates alleged. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 43 years old. She graduated from college in 1998. She married in 2005
and divorced  in  2007.  She  remarried  in 2010.  She  has two  children  ages four and  six
years old. She has worked for her present employer, a federal contractor, since October
2016. Before then, from 2000 to 2016, she worked in different departments at a university.
(Tr. 23-26; GE 1; AE B)
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  in  December  2016.
She  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  January  2018,  and  completed
government interrogatories in August 2018. She disclosed and admitted all of her past
illegal drug use and activity as follows:
Marijuana  use  with  varying  frequency  from  January  1992  to  September
2013.
Nitrous Oxide use on various occasions from February 1992 to June 2016.
Sold Nitrous Oxide in 2007 on at least two occasions.
Mushrooms  use  with  varying  frequency  from  about  August  2001  to  May
2013.
Ecstasy use approximately six times from August 2002 to May 2009.
LSD use on various occasions from August 2003 to May 2011.
2C-B, a hallucinogenic, used two times from 2003 to 2004.
2C-I, a hallucinogenic used in July 2003.
Peyote, used in 2004.
Foxy, a hallucinogenic, used in July 2007.
DMT, a hallucinogenic, used in 2008.
Poppers, an inhalant, used in 2009.
Applicant  disputed  the  date  alleged  regarding  her  use  of  hallucinogenic
mushrooms. She admitted she knowingly used mushrooms from 2001 to 2013. In June
2017, she attended a memorial service for a friend. She had previously used mushrooms
with some of the people who were also in attendance, but she had not seen them for a
while.  There  was  a  spiritual  ceremony  that  included  the  leader  dabbing  oil  on  each
attendee’s forehead and saying a blessing. The oil had mushroom extract in it. Because
of  the  nature  of  the  ceremony,  she  did  not  decline  the  blessing.  She  disclosed  this
information in her background interview. She testified that at the time, she did not consider
the potential implications or effects the mushrooms might have on her. She stated after
receiving the oil dab she did not feel any dramatic effect from the oil, but became aware
of a very slight altered feeling similar to consuming half of a can of beer. She testified that
she felt a duty to report this incident during her background interview even though it was
not an intentional choice at the time to abuse drugs. (Tr. 38-40, 44-50; GE 2, 3)
Applicant started using marijuana in high school. She estimated that from 1997 to
2007,  she  used  it  about  six  times  a  year.  She  estimated  she  used  marijuana  with  her
friends and her spouse from 2008 to 2013, about eight times a year. She used it socially
and  to  relax.  She  estimated  she  used  LSD  about  eight  times  from  2003  to  2011.  She
estimated she used Ecstasy about six times from 2002 to 2009. She used Poppers, DMT,
Foxy, and 2C-B once. She used 2C-I twice. She said that except for her marijuana and
LSD use, her use of other illegal drugs was before her second marriage. (Tr. 54, 61-75)
Applicant testified that a defining time in her life was when she became a mother
and it profoundly changed her lifestyle and social community. She does not want anything
to prevent her from giving her children the best opportunities that she can. Because any
illegal drug use would prevent her from doing so, she said she stopped using illegal drugs
in 2013. Becoming a mother also led her to improve her professional life. Since she began
working for her current employer she has been promoted. (Tr. 27-29, 33, 77-79; GE 1)
Applicant admitted she used Nitrous Oxide until June 2016, a period of time after
she stopped using other drugs. Because it was legal to obtain, she was unaware it was
illegal to inhale. It is commonly used in dental and medical procedures and its effect wear
off safely and quickly. She purchased it twice in 2007 and sold some to friends at parties
as a convenience. She admitted in her SCA that in hindsight she realized it was probably
illegal to inhale it. She did not sell it to make a profit, but did make a small one. Her use
of Nitrous Oxide after having children was to help her relax. She has not used it since
2016. (Tr. 33-38, 50-54, 66-68, 77-79, 82-83; AE D)
Applicant testified that she does not believe her husband still uses marijuana, but
has not asked him. He has not used it in their home and they have not used it together
since  2013.  She  credibly  testified  that  since  becoming  a  mother  her  priorities  have
changed,  and  she  is  focused  on  raising  her  family.  She  admitted  that  before  having
children, she exhibited behavior where she sought to find different types of “highs.” (Tr.
60-61, 66-67, 79-80)
Applicant testified and provided a written statement that she does not intend to use
illegal  drugs  in  the  future.  Since  becoming  a  mother  she  has  taken  management  and
technical  courses  to  improve  herself.  She  is  focused  on  self-development  through
exercise and martial arts. She testified that she has disassociated herself from her friends
who use drugs. She avoids places where there may be illegal drugs. Her social activity is
focused on her two young children and husband. (Tr. 40-41, 71, 77-79; AE E)
Applicant testified that she has never tested positive for illegal drug use and has
not  been  evaluated  or  diagnosed  with  a  substance  abuse  disorder.  She  voluntarily
disclosed all of her drug use. (Tr. 74-75).
Applicant’s  supervisor testified  on her  behalf.  He has  observed  her  daily for  the
past two and a half years. She is a valued employee and exhibits exceptional talent in her
field. She shared with him her past drug use. He has not witnessed any indication that
she continues to use drugs. He trusts her and believes she has exercised good judgment.
(Tr. 86-91)
Applicant provided character letters from her manager, a former supervisor for four
years, and a friend. She is described as honest, knowledgeable, trustworthy, dependable,
thoughtful,  deliberate,  and  stable.  She  exhibits  a  commitment  to  hard  work;  exercises
sound judgment; and since becoming a parent is steadfast in ensuring she is a positive
role model for her children. (Tr. 31; AE C)
