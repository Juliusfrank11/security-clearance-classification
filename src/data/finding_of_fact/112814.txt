In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d,
1.e,  and  1.l.  He  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.c,  1.f-1.k,  1.m,  and  2.a.  His
admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 30-year-old senior software quality assurance engineer employed
by a federal contractor since May 2019. He served in the U.S. Navy from March 2010 to
March 2014 and received an honorable discharge. He testified that he was unemployed
for about two months after his discharge from the Navy. (Tr. 25.) He worked for a non-
federal employer until August 2015, was unemployed for about three months, and then
worked  for  federal  contractors  until  he  was  hired  for  his  current  position.  (Tr.  29.)  He
received a security clearance in September 2009.
Applicant married in October 2010 and divorced in July 2015. He has two children,
ages six and one. The older child lives with her mother, and Applicant pays child support
of  $598  per  month  for  her.  The  younger  child,  whose  mother  is  Applicant’s  current
cohabitant, lives with Applicant. (Tr. 22.)
Applicant  attended  a  university  from  February  2016  to  April  2017,  a  community
college from May to August 2017, and a university from April 2017 to the present. He has
not received a degree.
While on active duty in the U.S. Navy, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment
for larceny in August 2013. He was restricted for 25 days, required to perform extra duties
for 45  days,  forfeited $243  pay  per month for two  months,  and  was  reduced from  pay
grade E-4 to E-3. According to Applicant, he was with another sailor when the other sailor
stole an item of clothing from the Navy Exchange. Applicant claimed that he was unaware
of the theft by the other sailor. (GX 2 at 16.) He answered “No” to a question in his SCA
asking  if,  during  the  last  seven  years,  he  had  been  subject  to  court-martial  or  other
disciplinary procedure under the Uniform Code of Military Justice such as Article 15 or
Captain’s mast. He did not disclose his August 2013 nonjudicial punishment (GX 1 at 22.)
The  documents  reflecting  the nonjudicial punishment  were  not  introduced  in  evidence,
but Applicant admitted that he received the nonjudicial punishment in his answer to the
SOR, during an interview by a security investigator, and at the hearing.
In  January,  March,  and  April  2018,  Applicant  was  questioned  by  a  security
investigator about his SCA. In his sworn responses to DOHA interrogatories in November
2018, he stated that the summary of his March 2018 interview with the investigator was
inaccurate regarding his nonjudicial punishment. His comments included the following:
When  initially  asked  about  any  court  martials  (sic)  or  non-judicial
punishments from  the interview,  I  disclosed the  information  saying  “Yes.”
On 8-27-2013, I was involved in an incident in which I unknowingly aided
an individual in stealing clothing from the Navy Exchange. I was found guilty
of Article 121–larceny, was reduced to the rank of E-3, and spent 45 days
confined to the ship’s quarters.”
(GX 2 at 2.)
In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he mistakenly thought that the question
dated back five years and not seven years. This explanation was unpersuasive, because
his punishment was imposed within five years of the date he submitted his SCA. He also
stated in his SOR answer that he was not reduced in rank or pay, but he stated in his
response to DOHA interrogatories that he was reduced in rank.
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  was  vague  about  his  reason  for  not  disclosing  the
nonjudicial punishment. He testified that he believed that he was being punished for not
supervising the sailor who stole the clothing and not being punishment for larceny. He
testified that he did not know how to justify his claim in his SOR answer that he thought
the question covered only five previous years. He testified that he did not believe that the
nonjudicial punishment would be reflected in his military record. (Tr. 49-51.)
The  SOR  alleges  13  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $56,573.  The  debts  are
reflected  in  credit  reports  from  January  2018  and  August  2018  (GX-3;  GX  4.)  The
evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: automobile loan charged off in January 2016 for $34,072. In his
SOR answer, Applicant stated that he was disputing this debt. He testified that this debt
was for an automobile purchased for his ex-wife before they divorced. When their divorce
was final, she stopped making the payments. The loan was in Applicant’s name, and he
acknowledged  at  the  hearing  that  he  was  responsible  for  making  the  payments.  He
testified  that  was  attempting  to  negotiate  a  payment  agreement  but  had  not  yet  been
successful. (Tr. 14-15.)
SOR ¶ 1.b: automobile loan charged off in April 2018 for $13,043. Applicant
testified that this debt was for a voluntary repossession after a dealer refused to honor a
recall notice on a defective transmission because he had purchased it from a third party
rather  than  a  dealer.  (tr.  45.)  He  testified  that  this  debt  is  being  handled  by  a  debt-
consolidation company, and that the creditor had agreed to a 36-month repayment plan.
(Tr. 15.) He did not submit any documentation of this payment plan. In his post-hearing
submission, he presented a document reflecting an offer to pay $250 per month on this
debt. (AX C.) He did not submit any evidence that the offer was actually submitted and
accepted  by  the  creditor  and  no  evidence  of  any  payments.  He  also  submitted  a
document, apparently from a law firm, listing this debt, but no evidence of payments or a
payment agreement. (AX D.) The debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.c:  telecommunications  account  placed  for  collection  of  $1,718  in
December  2015.  Applicant  testified  that  he  disputed  this  debt  because  he  was  being
charged for two cellphones instead of one. (Tr. 44.) He testified that the debt is no longer
reflected on his credit report. (Tr. 15.) However, it is reflected in the August 2018 credit
report. (GX 4 at 2.) The debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.d:  debt  to  electronics  institute  placed  for  collection  of  $1,672  in
October 2015. Applicant incurred this debt for online computer classes, and it is included
in  his  debt-consolidation  plan.  He  testified  that  the  creditor  has  agreed  to  a  36-month
repayment plan. (Tr. 15-16.) In his post-hearing submission, he submitted a document,
apparently from a law firm, listing this debt, but no evidence of payments or a payment
agreement. (AX D.). The debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.e:  medical bill charged  off for  $1,585 in  December  2012.  Applicant
testified that this medical bill was for his oldest daughter, that it is included in his debt-
consolidation plan, and the creditor has agreed to a 36-month repayment plan. (Tr. 16.)
In his post-hearing submission, he a provided a copy of his credit report reflecting that the
debt was paid. (AX B.)
SOR ¶ 1.f: credit-card account charged off for $1,320 in January 2012. In his
SOR answer, Applicant stated that this debt was disputed and is no longer reflected in
his  credit  reports.  After  the  hearing,  Applicant  submitted  a  copy  of  his  credit  report
reflecting that the debt was paid. (AX A.)
SOR ¶ 1.g: utility bill placed for collection of $210 in November 2017. In his
SOR answer, Applicant stated that he disputed this debt and all late fees were dropped,
and that he had agreed to make two $73 payments in February 2019. Applicant testified
that this debt has been paid in full. (Tr. 16.) He submitted documentation of the payment
in his answer to the SOR.
SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i: telecommunications accounts charged off in November
2017 for $128 and $70. In Applicant’s SOR answer, he stated that both debts would be
paid in March 2019. At the hearing, he testified that these two debts have been paid in
full. (Tr. 16.) He submitted no documentation to support his testimony.
SOR  ¶  1.j:  child-support  arrearage  of  $1,505.  Applicant  testified  that  this
arrearage  occurred  while  he  was  unemployed  for  three  months.  He  testified  that  the
arrearage has been paid in full and his child-support payments are current. (Tr. 17.) The
debt is not reflected in the August 2018 credit report. It is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.k: charge account past due for $159. In Applicant’s SOR answer, he
stated that the debt would be paid in March 2019. At the hearing, testified that this debt
was  paid  in  full.  (Tr.  17.)  After  the  hearing,  he  submitted  a  copy  of  his  credit  report
reflecting that the debt was paid. (AX A.) It is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.l: gym membership referred for collection of $932. Applicant testified
that he made a payment agreement in March 2019, but he has now disputed the account
because the gym was notified to terminate the payments  while he was being deployed
overseas, but they continued to bill him. (Tr. 17.) The debt is not listed among the debt
being handled by his debt-consolidation company. (AX C.) He provided no documentation
of his dispute. The debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.m: medical bill placed for collection of $159. Applicant testified that
this bill has been paid in full. (Tr. 17-18.) He did not submit any documentary evidence
supporting his testimony.
Applicant  currently  earns  $92,000  per  year.  (Tr.  25.)  After  paying  all  living
expenses,  he  has  a  net  monthly  remainder of  about  $1,400.  (Tr. 32.)  He  testified  that
receiving the SOR in December 2018 prompted him to take action to resolve his debts.
(Tr. 37.) When asked why he waited so long to take action after he was questioned by a
security investigator about his debts in January 2018, he said, “I don’t have a response.”
(Tr. 38.) In May 2019, he made a 36-month contract with a debt-consolidation company,
and he pays it $380 per month to resolve his delinquent debts. (Tr. 33.)
