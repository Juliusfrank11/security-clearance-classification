Applicant  admitted  to  the  two  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.,  and  1.b.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 17 line
3  to  page  18  line  4,  and  GX  1  at  page  5.)  He  has  been  employed  with  the  defense
contractor  since  “February  of  2016.”  (TR  at  page  17  lines  10~17.)  Applicant  is  well
respected in the workplace. (AppX A.)
Guideline E - Personal Conduct
1.a. Applicant admits that he falsified his April 2017 Electronic Questionnaire for
Investigations  Processing  (e-QIP)  in  his  response  to  “Section  23  –  Illegal  Use  of
Drugs.”  (TR  at  page  18  line  5  to  page  21  at  line  25,  and  GX  1  at  pages  32~33.)  He
thought his one-time usage in 2011 was “irrelevant.” (TR at page 18 lines 17~25.) I find
this to be a willful falsification.
1.b. In June of 2018, Applicant admits that he was less than candid with a DoD
investigator  when  he  failed  to  disclose  his  more  recent  one-time  use  of  marijuana  in
September of 2017. (TR at page 22 line 1 to page 24 line 17, and GX 2.) I find this to be
another willful falsification.
