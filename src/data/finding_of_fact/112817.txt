Guideline E: Personal Conduct
1.a.  Applicant  denies  that  she  submitted  falsified  and  fraudulent  documents
relating to an application to University M in August of 2014. In her application, Applicant
averred that she graduated from College B in July of 2014, when in fact she received her
undergraduate  degree  in  December  of  2014.  (Items  4~8.)  In  her  answer  to  the  SOR,
Applicant claims “I did not apply nor submit the needed documents to University” M. (Item
2 at page 1.) This averment is contradicted by her December 9, 2014, statement in which
Applicant admits to have “started a graduate application on 7/23/2014.” (Item 6 at page
2.) She also admits said application was “submitted” on “8/17/2014.” (Id.) This allegation
is found against Applicant.
1.b.  Applicant  denies  that  she  falsified  material  facts  during  an  interview  with  a
DoD  investigator  on  February  26,  2018,  by  denying  that  she  submitted  falsified  and
fraudulent documents relating to an application to University M in 2014. In her answer to
the SOR, Applicant avers, “that all this took place when . . . [her] laptop was out of . . .
[her] possession.” (Item 2 at page 1.) Applicant further avers that, “in 2014 . . . [she] was
involved in a car accident where  . . . [her] MacBook Pro was stolen.” (Id.) By her own
admission,  the  accident  occurred  “August  22,  2014.”  (Item  5  at  page  54.)  This  is
contradicted  by  a  letter  from  University  M  stating  that  “the  graduate  application  was
started on 07/23/2014, approximately one month prior to” the MacBook Pro being stolen.
This allegation is found against Applicant.
