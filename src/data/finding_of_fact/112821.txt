In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted his home went to foreclosure, but
denied the five additional delinquent obligations listed in the SOR. After a thorough review
of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  49-year-old  program  manager  who  has  worked  for  a  defense
contractor since February 2007 and seeks to obtain a security clearance. He is married,
and  has  a  daughter  age  22  and  a  son  age  18.  His  annual  salary  is  approximately
$125,000  and  his  wife,  a  special  education  school  teacher,  has  an  annual  salary  of
$50,000. (Tr. 23) She has been employed as a teacher for 22 years. (Tr. 27)
When  Applicant  completed  his  March  2017  Electronic  Questionnaires  for
Investigation Processing (e-QIP), he indicated he had two delinquent obligations of $428
and $103 He also listed a delinquent $1,800 student loan and stated he was currently in
the  process  of  establishing  a  monthly  $250  automatic  draft  to  pay  the  student  loan
obligation. (Ex. 1)
The  SOR  alleges  six  delinquent debts,  and  the  record  establishes  the  status  of
Applicant’s past-due accounts as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges $27,084 was past due on his mortgage that went to foreclosure.
(Ex. 3) Applicant stated he purchased the home in 1997. He paid $72,000 for the home
and obtained a mortgage requiring monthly mortgage payments of $1,200. (Tr. 18) His
July 2017 credit report indicating that in July 2006, the current lender obtained the 30-
year mortgage with a balance of $76,000. The mortgage required monthly payments of
$993. (Ex. 3, 4) As of July 2017, the balance owed was $78,516.
In  June  2018,  Applicant  had  an  enhanced  subject  interview  during  which  his
finances  were  discussed.  His  wife  failed  to  pay  the  mortgage  for  four  or  five  months
resulting in $27,084 becoming past due. (Ex. 2) He was unaware his wife was not making
the  mortgage  payments  as  required.  He  indicated  that  his  wife  was  handling  the
household’s  finances.  (Tr.  17,  28,  31)  That  has  since  changed,  Applicant  has  taken  a
more active role in the household’s finances.
Applicant went to court and was given the option to bring the mortgage current or
vacate the property. (Tr. 17) He chose to leave. The bank gave him three months to leave.
(Ex. 2) In August 2016, the bank forced him to leave the residence. (Ex. 2) He asserts he
has not received any correspondence from the lender following the foreclosure nor has
he contacted the lender since leaving the home. (Tr. 25) He does not know the home’s
sale price at foreclosure nor the amount of equity he accumulated during the 19 years he
owned the home. (Tr. 26) He says failing to list the foreclosure on his March 2017 was
not an intentional omission or misrepresentation. (Ex. 2)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges an $834 charged-off credit card account. (Ex. 4) The account
was  opened  in  July  2017.  (Ex.  2)  In  his  December  2018  SOR  Response  and  at  the
hearing, Applicant stated he did not know the nature of the debt. (Tr. 19)

in  January  2017.  (Ex.  2)  In  his  December  2018  SOR  Response  and  at  the  hearing,

SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  a  $428  collection  account.  (Ex.  3)  During  his  June  2018
interview, Applicant indicated the debt was a credit card account. He had no knowledge
about why it was not paid or when it went to collection. He asserts he paid the debt, but
provided no documentation supporting such payment. (Ex. 2) In his December 2018 SOR

up on the debt and satisfy it. (Ex. 2)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a $103 telephone service collection account. (Ex. 3) During his
June 2018 interview, Applicant indicated he was unaware of this debt. He contacted the
creditor and was told this was an old land-line account. He stated he believed this debt
was paid when the land line was disconnected. He provided no documentation showing
payment of the debt. He indicated he would follow up on the debt and satisfy it. (Ex. 2)
In Applicant’s December 2018 SOR Response, for the delinquent obligations listed
in SOR 1.b through 1.f., he stated. “I will work with this company to pay what is owed to
them. I am not aware of this company.” (SOR Response) At the hearing, he recognized
the debts in SOR 1.a and 1.f. He said he would contact the companies and take care of
the  debts.  (Tr.  21)  He  provided  no  documentation  that  he  made  any  payments  on  the
SOR delinquent obligations during the four months between his receipt of the SOR and
the hearing. There is no showing he has contacted any of the holders of the delinquent
obligations. (Tr. 35) At his hearing, he stated he would contact the companies and pay
the debts within two months of the hearing. (Tr. 36)
