Applicant is 40 years old. He served honorably in the U.S. Air Force (USAF) from
1997 – 2011. He has been employed as a logistics analyst by a federal contractor since
December  2016.  He  was  unemployed  briefly  between  contract  assignments  since
leaving  active  duty.  He  has  held  a  second  job  as  a  fitness  trainer  since  June  2016.
Applicant  reported  a  previous  security  clearance  in  1997  from  his  time  on  active  duty,
with  no  incidents.  Applicant  has  been  married  and  divorced  three  times:  from  2001  to
2006; from 2006 to 2009; and again from 2010 to 2014. He has two adult children.
Applicant  reported  his  failure  to  timely  file  a  federal  income  tax  return,  and  pay
income taxes for tax year (TY) 2015 in section 26 of his security clearance application
(SCA).2  There,  he  stated  that  he  relied  on  a  tax-preparation  service,  which  was
eventually shut down by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for filing fraudulent returns.
Consequently,  he  owed  the  IRS  $14,000.  Applicant  claimed  that  he  previously
established  a  payment  plan  with  the  IRS  making  installment  payments  of  $250  per
month. He provided no substantiating documentation.
Applicant  provided  a  detailed  answer  to  the  SOR  on  November  28,  2018
(Answer).  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  the  allegation  that  he  owes  the  IRS
$14,000  in  overdue  federal  income  taxes  at  SOR  ¶  1.i.  He  also  admitted  the  alleged
charged-off  and  delinquent  debts  placed  for  collection  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  -1.h.  In
section  26  of  his  SCA,  he  also  disclosed  consumer  debts,  which  accrued  during  his
marital separation when he used his credit-card to make ends meet. He exhausted his
savings  waiting  for  a  promised  job  with  a  federal  contractor  in  early  2016,  but  the
contract  and  the  job  did  not  materialize.3  The  delinquent  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR
amount to $76,265.
The  mortgage  account  that  is  past-due  in  the  amount  of  $32,761  at  SOR  ¶  1.a
resulted  when  his  ex-wife  occupied  their  home  after  they  divorced.  She  did  not  make
payments  on  this  joint  mortgage  and  he  claims  he  has  been  unable  to  contact  her.
(Answer) The charged-off debt in the amount of $11,748 at SOR ¶ 1.b was for a vehicle
that  Applicant  could  no  longer  afford  after  his  divorce.  He  voluntarily  surrendered  it.
(Answer)  He  provided  no  information  about  the  deficiency  owed,  or  what  he  did  to
satisfy it.
The  charged-off  debt  in  the  amount  of  $9,596  at  SOR  ¶  1.c  resulted  when
Applicant  was  unemployed  for  several  months  after  resigning  from  one  job  with  the
expectation  that  another  job  would  commence  once  a  contract  was  awarded.  His

putative  employer  lost  the  contract  and  the  job  never  materialized.  He  exhausted  his
savings  in  the  interim. He  was  unable  to  pay  the  delinquent  debts  at  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and
1.e for the same reasons, and stated that he would enter a payment plan or pay these
debts. (Answer) No documentation corroborating these claims has been provided.
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  a  debt  in  the  amount  of  $472  placed  for  collection  by  a
telecommunications  company  for  a  cable  box  and  modem  that  Applicant  says  he
returned. Applicant disputes the alleged debt in the amount of $489 at SOR ¶ 1.g. He
provided no dispute letter or other evidence. SOR ¶ 1.h alleges an account placed for
collection in the amount of $795. Applicant claims, without substantiation, that he made
the final payment in July 2018 and the account is closed. (Answer)
Applicant claims to have made arrangements with the IRS to pay $250  a month
to settle his federal tax debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i. This was being deducted by automatic
debit  from  his  previous  bank  account.  (Response  to  Form)  Yet,  he  provided    no  bank
statement or evidence of payments. It is unclear why he stopped making the payments
in  the  first  instance.  He  provided  no  evidence  that  he  received  financial  counseling  or
debt  consolidation  assistance.4  He  provided  no  budget  showing  income  against
expenses,  or  other  documentation  to  show  progress  on  his  delinquent  debts.  He
professed  his  intentions  to  pay  his  overdue  income  taxes  and  repay  his  delinquent
debts  in  his  SCA  in  January  2016,  and  in  his  PSI  in  May  2018.  He  produced  no
documentary evidence that he has done so.
