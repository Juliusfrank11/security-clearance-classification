The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of October 4, 2018, Applicant defaulted
on five student loans that had been charged off for $41,561 (SOR ¶ 1.a), $38,828 (SOR ¶
1.b), $35,254 (SOR ¶ 1.c), $29,535 (SOR ¶ 1.d), and $7,889 (SOR ¶ 1.e). Additionally,
Applicant owed on a credit-card account placed for collection for $4,141 (SOR ¶ 1.f). When
Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, she admitted owing the student loans, but
indicated that she was repaying them at $100 a month since September 2017; that she
intended to continue to make that payment for the next 11 months; and that she planned to
increase  her  payment  to  $500  a  month  after  her  car  is  paid  off  in  October 2019.  She
explained she was unable to meet the $1,200 monthly payment term on her student loans
because she lacked full-time employment. As for the credit-card debt, she explained that
her account was not currently delinquent, and she has established electronic repayments
through November 2022.
After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 35-year-old administrative assistant with a defense contractor. She
has  never  married,  but  she  is  engaged.  She  and  her  fiancé  have  a  five-year-old  son.
Applicant and her fiancé began a cohabitant relationship in approximately October 2010.
(GEs 1-2; Tr. 48-49.) In late February 2019, Applicant and her fiancé moved into a home
that he purchased from his brother. (Tr. 5, 49.) Applicant’s fiancé has covered the rent and
now mortgage throughout their cohabitant relationship. Applicant’s living expenses are
reduced because she has not had to pay rent or contribute to the mortgage. (Tr. 48-49.)
Applicant attended a private university in her home state from 2002 to 2006, when
she earned her bachelor’s degree in teaching physical education. (GE 2; Tr. 31-32, 36.)
She paid for her education largely with student loans. Available account records (AE A)
and credit reports (GEs 3-4) show that she obtained a combination of federal and private
student loans totaling approximately $100,000.1 (AE A.)
After college, Applicant worked as a leasing agent for a real estate company. She
was employed full time until January 2007 and then part time one day per week until May
2007. In January 2007, Applicant began working full time on a contract basis as a medical
records technician at a military health clinic while also attending a local community college.
In January 2009, Applicant withdrew from the community college and moved back to her
home state. She became employed in a contract position with a pharmaceutical company.
(GEs 1-2.) Applicant or her father made consistent payments on her private student loans
from October 2008 to February 2010. (GE 2; AE A.)
In approximately July 2010, Applicant returned to work at the military health clinic.
(GEs  1-2.)  Available  student-loan  payment  records  from  the  loan  servicer  reflect  no
payments on her student loans from April 2010 to December 2010, when $20,302 was
credited to her account. (AE A.) It is unclear what led to this credit entry. Total payments of
$1,857 were credited to her account in 2011. (AE A.)
In November 2012, Applicant became unemployed. She moved in with her mother
and stepfather. Her mother was ill and needed her care and assistance. Applicant collected
unemployment compensation from approximately November 2012 to September 2013.
After her son was born in July 2013, Applicant was primarily a stay-at-home mother. She
worked part-time on the weekends as a unit secretary at a hospital from September 2013
until April 2015. From January 2015 to June 2017, Applicant drove a school bus 30 hours a
week at $14 an hour while school was in session. Her take-home pay was approximately
$300 a week. During the summers of 2015, 2016, and 2017, she was laid off and collected
unemployment compensation of $150 to $190 per week. (GE 2; Tr. 27-28.) Her federal
student loans were deferred when she was unemployed, although interest continued to
accrue on the loans. (Tr. 40.)
Applicant or her father made some of her student loan payments, including of $743
per month from September 2012 through November 2013 and $652 per month in 2014,
although payments were sometimes late.2 (GE 2; AE A.) Payments on her private student
loans were minimal after April 2015, and interest continued to accrue on the loans, which
had  interest  rates  of  6.25%  to  11.25%  depending  on  the  loan.  Neither  Applicant  nor
apparently her father could afford the $1,200 to $1,300 a month then required on the loans,
and the loan servicer was not willing to accept lower payments. (GE 2; Tr. 35.) In January
2016  two  of  her  private  student  loans  were  charged  off  for  $41,516  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  and
1 Applicant testified that she obtained about $100,000 in student loans that have now accrued to approximately
$190,000 due to interest and fees. (Tr. 45.) The account history with the loan servicer for both her private and
federal student loans lists disbursements of $9,399 in November 2004; $9,399 in January 2005; $4,900 in
March  2005;  $22,222  in  October  2005;  $18,000  in  October  2005;  $11,620  in  February  2006;  $4,800  in
February 2006; and $13,121 in November 2006. (AE A.) The private loans were to be repaid at $1,133 a
month per the available credit information. (GE 4.)
2 Applicant testified in part, “The bigger payments—like the $652—those type of payments—those definitely
came from my dad helping me financially.” (Tr. 44.)
$38,828 (SOR ¶ 1.b). In February 2016, three more private student loans were charged off
in the amounts of $35,254 (SOR ¶ 1.c), $29,535 (SOR ¶ 1.d), and $7,889 (SOR ¶ 1.e).
(GE 3.) The loan servicer offered to settle her loans for a lump-sum payment of $75,000
that she could not afford. (Tr. 30.)
Applicant became seriously delinquent on a credit-card account (SOR ¶ 1.f) in late
2015. Available credit reports show that she brought her account current in February 2016
before ceasing payment again in  July 2016. In January 2017, Applicant’s account  was
referred for collection. As of April 2017, her account was $4,658 past due. (GE 3.)
With her son about to start full-day school, Applicant applied to work with a defense
contractor. (Tr. 28.) On March 25, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy
of  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86).  She  reported  no  issues  of
potential security concern, including no delinquencies involving routine accounts in the last
seven years. (GE 1.)
A check of Applicant’s credit on May 16, 2017, revealed that she had defaulted on
five private student loans and on the credit card account. Applicant was making timely
payments on a credit-card account with a balance of $5,904 and on an unsecured loan
with a $4,158 balance, although both accounts had been past due previously. She was
making $405 monthly payments on a car loan obtained for $18,424 in June 2014 with a
current  balance  of  $10,822.  Her  federal  student  loans  were  in  deferment  with  a
consolidated balance of $15,169. (GE 3.)
In late August 2017, Applicant began working for the defense contractor at $17.69
an hour. (Tr. 28.) As an administrative assistant with an interim clearance in a secured
building,  she  worked  on  technical  manuals  containing  both  classified  and  unclassified
information. (Tr. 37-38.) In September 2017, she began repaying her delinquent credit card
(SOR ¶ 1.f) at $50 a month under a repayment arrangement that ends in November 2022.
(AE B; Tr. 29, 42.)
Applicant’s  charged-off  private  student  loans  were  placed  for  collection  with  a
collection  entity  willing  to  accept  what  she  could  afford  in  repayment,  and  she  began
repaying the loans at $100 a month in February 2018. As of April 2009, Applicant had
missed no payments, although her payments were late in May 2018 and August 2018. (AE
A; Tr. 29, 40.) By then, the loans had been  transferred back to the loan servicer, who
accepted the repayment arrangement. Despite her consistent repayments since February
2018,  Applicant  had  made  little  to  no  progress  in  reducing  the  balance  of  her  private
student loans because of the interest rate on the loans. (Tr. 45.)
On July 3, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  Applicant  volunteered  that  she  had  financial
delinquencies  that  should  have  been  reported  on  her  SF  86.  She  explained  that  she
obtained student loans for her undergraduate education, and that she could not afford the
monthly repayment required. Her father made the payments for her until approximately
2015, when he could no longer afford to do so. She advised the loan servicer that she
could not afford the payments. Sometime in early 2018, she arranged with a collection
entity to make $100 monthly payments. Applicant expressed an intention to re-evaluate her
finances in October 2018 and see whether she could increase her monthly payment. She
estimated her outstanding balance at $160,000 for five private student loans and indicated
that two other loans had been paid off previously. She expressed her belief that she had no
other past-due debts. When confronted about the credit-card delinquency in SOR ¶ 1.f,
Applicant stated that she had failed to recall the debt earlier, but it was being repaid at $50
a month toward a current balance of $4,100. Applicant attributed her financial problems to
underemployment and unemployment. On July 3, 2018, Applicant was re-contacted by the
OPM investigator. Applicant provided proof that she was making payments toward her
delinquent credit card and her private student loans. (GE 2.)
As  of  July  2018,  Applicant  reportedly  owed  $184,528  on  her  defaulted  private
student loans ($51,380 on SOR ¶ 1.a; $48,001 on SOR ¶ 1.b; $43,097 on SOR ¶ 1.c;
$33,185 on SOR ¶ 1.d; and $8,865 on SOR ¶ 1.e). The balance on her delinquent credit
card in SOR ¶ 1.f was $4,141. She had no other past-due debts on her credit record. She
owed $5,907 on her $18,424 car loan; $16,106 in federal student-loan debt; $5,374 on a
credit-card account closed by the credit grantor; and $3,598 on an unsecured loan. Those
accounts were rated as current. (GE 4.)
Applicant began repaying her federal student-loan debt at $65 a month in November
2018, after she was contacted about her ability to commence repayment. (Tr. 40-41.) She
has remained current on her federal loans since then. (AE A.) She recently received an
offer to settle her federal student-loan debt of approximately $16,000 for $10,000 payable
at $250 a month for five months followed by $85 a month until the $10,000 is paid. After
some consideration, she elected not to accept the offer because of the tax implications in
that she would have to report cancelled debt as income on her tax returns. (Tr. 47.)
On October 4, 2018, Applicant was issued an SOR because of her large private
student-loan delinquencies and her credit-card debt in collection. Her employer moved her
to a non-secure building and gave her unclassified work handling correspondence. (Tr. 31,
37-38.)  She  does  not  need  a  security  clearance  for  those  duties  but  advancement
prospects within the company are limited without a clearance. (Tr. 37.)
Applicant received a $4,000 income tax refund for tax year 2018 in 2019. She saved
$1,000 of her refund for a summer vacation. She paid down her car loan to a balance of
$1,700 as of April 2019, and  also purchased items for her new home. (Tr. 30, 42-43.)
Based on her required monthly payment, Applicant’s car loan will be paid off in October
2019. She hopes to satisfy her car loan by mid-July 2019, which would free up about $400
a month. She plans to put the funds toward her credit-card and student-loan delinquencies
“to try and get ahead of the interest” on her private student loans. (Tr. 29, 33-34, 46.) As of
April 2019, her private student-loan debt had accrued to approximately $190,000. (Tr. 45.)
In hindsight, she regrets taking on such sizeable student-loan debt because of the financial
burden. (Tr. 32.)
Applicant  had  credit  counseling  six  or  seven  years  ago.  (Tr.  47.)  Her  fiancé’s
mortgage on their home is being repaid at $993 a month. He had been paying $1,200 a
month in rent before he bought their home. (Tr. 49.) Applicant’s fiancé was self-employed
for about five years, during which time they “were scraping by.” He returned to work a year
ago. (Tr. 49.) The record contains no information about his employment or income.
