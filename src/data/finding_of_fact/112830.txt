Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  financial  allegations,  except  SOR  1.g,  1.j-1.k,  and
1.m-1.n,  which  she  disputed.  She  is  a  52-year-old  technical  program  manager
employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  March  2015.  She  was  unemployed  from
October 2014 to March 2015, and from October 2009 to November 2011 (GE 1). She
claims to have previously held a clearance, but was unable to provide any dates.
The  SOR  alleges,  and  GE  1-4  substantiate,  14  delinquent  debts  totaling  over
$97,000.  Applicant  admits  nine  debts  totaling  over  $94,000.  She  also  admits  filing  for
Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in January 2011, with a discharge of her eligible debts
in May 2011. She disclosed the bankruptcy petition on her September 2016 clearance
application (GE 1).  The  debts comprise a $23,000 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax
lien  (SOR  1.a),  two  delinquent  education  loans  totaling  over  $60,000  (SOR  1.b-1.c)),
two  delinquent  vehicle  loans  (SOR  1.e-1.f),  and  nine  delinquent  consumer  accounts
(SOR 1.g-1.o). Applicantâ€™s post-hearing exhibits show that on 4 April 2019, she entered
a  debt  management  program  not  otherwise  detailed  (AE  A).  On  5  April  2019,  she
authorized full payment on SOR debt 1.o (AE B). She did not otherwise document any
of the claimed payment arrangements or payments asserted during her hearing.
Applicant  attributed  her  2011  bankruptcy  to  her  ongoing  unemployment.  Her
2014-2015 unemployment led to additional financial problems,  as did some periods of
underemployment after 2015. She claimed to be making regular payments to the IRS,
but did not document any payment arrangement or payments. She claimed to have paid
SOR debt 1.k, but again, did not document the payment. She had not taken any action
to address the  remainder of  her debts. Applicant  works a full-time job and  a part-time
job, and her husband works full time as well. Their combined monthly take-home pay is
about $13,000. They have $400-500 positive monthly cash flow (Tr. 47-51).
Applicant received the financial counseling required by her 2011 bankruptcy, but
has  not  otherwise  received  credit  or  financial  counseling  (Tr.  54).  The  pastor  of  her
current  church,  a  former  supervisor,  and  a  former  user-agency  representative  gave
Applicant  favorable  references.  However,  none  of  them  noted  any  awareness  of  her
financial  issues  (AE  A).  Her  work  performance  was  recently  praised  by  her  superiors
and the user agency (AE C).
