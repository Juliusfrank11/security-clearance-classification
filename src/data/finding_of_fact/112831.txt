In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted the delinquent obligations set forth
in the SOR and indicated she was establishing repayment plans with her creditors. After
a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is a 45-year-old over-the-road truck driver who has worked for a defense
contractor  since  May  2017  and  seeks  to  obtain  a  security  clearance.  Her  income  is
dependent on the number of loads she hauls. (Tr. 28) Her income last year was between
$35,000  and  $40,000,  which  included  $628  monthly  from  her  ex-husband’s  military
retirement. (Tr. 35, 40. 61) From August 1993 thought September 1994, she honorably
served in the U.S. Air Force. (Tr. 65) In 1993, she had been granted a secret security

daughters  ages  24  and  21.  (Ex.  1,  Tr.  32)  In  April  2010,  she  was  divorced  having

Security Administration (TSA) clearance. (Tr. 72) Applicant and her partner hope to save
$30,000 over the next five years in order to purchase their own truck. (Tr. 73)
Following her divorce, Applicant lived with a girlfriend who caused serious financial
problems. Applicant was the only one working and had difficulty controlling her friend’s
spending. (Tr. 25) Applicant was an assistant store manager making ten dollars per hour.

On  Applicant’s  September  2017  Electronic  Questionnaires  for  Investigations
Processing (e-QIP), she indicated she had filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy protection in

could no longer be found. (Tr. 55) She is continuing to pursue this obligation. (Tr. 55) The
other creditor she has been unable to reach was the holder of the vehicle debt (SOR  ¶
