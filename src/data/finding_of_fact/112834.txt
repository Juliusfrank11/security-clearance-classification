After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 49-year-old high school graduate who retired from the U.S. military in
late  August  2016  after  over  24  years  of  active-duty  service.  He  served  honorably  and
achieved  the  rank  of  chief  petty  officer.  He  has  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  as  a
uniformed protection officer since August 2016. (GE 1; AEs J-K.) Applicant was granted a
secret clearance in July 2014. (GE 4; AE K.) His employer has requested that he obtain a
top secret clearance. (Tr. 109.)
Applicant and his spouse have been married since March 1994, although they have
been together longer. (GE 1; Tr. 45.) They have two daughters, ages 24 and 27. Applicant
adopted his older daughter when she was three years old. (Tr. 111.)
Applicant directly supported Operation Enduring Freedom, and he was awarded
several decorations and medals for meritorious military service. (AE J.)  Because of his
various military deployments, including 21 months in Southwest Asia,1 his spouse handled
their household finances with little oversight from him. (Tr. 103-105, 117-118.) Applicant’s
spouse worked as a laboratory technician part time, earning $30,000 a year before July
2007. (GE 1; Tr. 55.) In 2008, she was diagnosed with cancer. When her illness went into
remission,  she  worked  in  the  healthcare  industry  earning  $40,000  a  year.  In  2010,
Applicant and his spouse’s younger daughter was diagnosed with bone marrow failure,
which was treated with a very expensive medication.2 (AEs A-B; Tr. 30, 53.) TRICARE
covered of some of her medical expenses at 80%, and for about one year, Applicant’s
spouse had a second insurance through her employer. She lost the insurance coverage
when she became a per-diem employee so that she could care for their daughter. (Tr. 47-
48.)
In 2012, Applicant’s spouse stopped working after she was injured at work. (GE 4;
Tr. 56.) In July 2012, Applicant purchased a 2008 model-year vehicle, obtaining a six-year
loan of $25,350 (SOR ¶ 1.a). His monthly car payments were $594. Applicant’s spouse
made the car payments on time for a couple of years, despite mounting medical expenses.
(GE 2.)
Applicant’s spouse testified that she and Applicant paid about $130,000 to $140,000
out-of-pocket for their daughter’s medical care over the years, including about $3,200 a
month  for  approximately  nine  months  from  2012  to  2013  for  a  medication  when  their
daughter,  then  age  18,  was  pregnant.  (Tr.  30-32,  53.)  Applicant  did  not  present
documentation showing those payments. He submitted records for their daughter’s care in
2013  which  show  that  claims  totaling  $1,096,086  were  submitted  to  TRICARE  for  her
chemotherapy from January 15, 2013, to August 15, 2013.3 (AE A.) Separate hospital
billing records for their daughter show expenses of $193,578 incurred between January 2,
2013,  and  July  18,  2013,  that  were  paid  by  TRICARE  or  written  off  as  “other  govt.
allowance.” (AE B.) However, approximately $1,097,394 owed to a cancer institute for their
daughter’s care went unpaid.4 (AE I.)
1 Applicant did not detail his deployments. His SF 86 indicates that he was in Southwest Asia from June 2006
to June 2007. (GE 1.) He was apparently deployed to Kuwait from May 2009 to February 2010. (GE 2.) His DD
214 indicates that he received the Iraq Campaign Medal and that he served one year and nine months in Iraq.
(AE J.)
2 Applicant’s spouse testified that she went into remission in 2010 and that “almost to the day that [she] was in
remission,” their daughter was diagnosed with bone marrow failure; that their insurance did not then cover the
treatments; and that she and Applicant paid about $130,000 to $140,000 out-of-pocket for their daughter’s
care. (Tr. 30.) According to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing, the debt to the cancer institute was incurred in
December 2010. (AE I.)
3 Applicant’s daughter married her child’s father in January 2013. (GE 1.) Available custody records indicate
that her husband was “often at sea.” (AE C.) He was apparently in the military. Neither Applicant nor his
spouse explained why they continued to pay medical expenses for their daughter after her marriage, although
there is no evidence that their daughter had insurance coverage other than TRICARE through Applicant.
4 Applicant did not submit any medical records from the cancer institute. The TRICARE claims in AE A could
be for care at the cancer institute, although they do not name the provider of care. She was treated with
Applicant’s daughter gave birth to a daughter in April 2013, and in 2014, she lost
temporary custody of her child to her parents. She had serious drug addiction issues, and
her husband was often at sea. In December 2014, Applicant and his spouse were granted
legal permanent custody of their granddaughter. Their daughter had relapsed into drug
abuse after attending an intensive drug-rehabilitation program. (GE 1; AE C; Tr. 34, 122.)
In  February  2016,  the  court  denied  a  motion  to  terminate  Applicant  and  his  spouse’s
guardianship  of  their  granddaughter.  (AE  C.)  As  of  February  2019,  Applicant  and  his
spouse want to adopt their grandchild, but the father will not give up his parental rights. (Tr.
46-47, 123.)
In March 2014, Applicant’s spouse was diagnosed with a terminal illness, and given
a  life  expectancy  of  three  to  five  years.  (Tr.  33,  45.)  In  December  2016,  she  became
eligible  for  hospital  insurance  under  Medicare.  In  June  2017,  she  was  granted  Social
Security disability status, and she became eligible for Medicare medical insurance. She
received  a  lump-sum  payment  of  $20,458  in  retroactive  disability  income,  and  began
receiving monthly Social Security Disability income (SSDI) of $554 a month. (AE D; Tr. 56-
58.) The lump-sum disability payment went to repair a vehicle and to catch up on some
household bills. (Tr. 57.)
Applicant continued to perform his military duties with professionalism despite his
difficult family circumstances. His enlisted performance evaluation for 2015 indicates he
had his superior’s highest recommendation for advancement. Applicant was considered the
“ideal ambassador” for military bearing and rated as excellent in several competencies. (AE
L.) Applicant went on terminal leave from the U.S. military in June 2016. (AE J; Tr. 104-
106.)
Applicant began working for his defense-contractor employer in August 2016. On
September 4, 2016, he completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for
National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  on  which  he  disclosed  one  delinquency  involving
routine accounts. He indicated that he owed approximately $3,000 on a loan for a vehicle
that was voluntarily repossessed (SOR ¶ 1.a). He explained that the debt was incurred
because of his spouse’s and his daughter’s medical issues. He indicated that the creditor
was willing to settle the debt for a lump sum and that his spouse would be receiving a
settlement that would be used to pay off their debts so that they would be debt free by the
end of the year. (GE 1.)
A check of Applicant’s credit on September 29, 2016, revealed that the creditor
listed on his SF 86 had charged off his auto loan for $9,842 in July 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.a).
Moreover, he owed several other past-due debts. A utility provider had charged off his
account  for  $3,384  in  December  2011  (SOR  ¶  1.i).  Equifax  and  Experian  reported  a
payday loan obtained in December 2012 had been charged off for $2,917 in January 2016
(SOR ¶ 1.b). Trans Union reported that the creditor had charged off a note loan obtained in
December 2012 for $2,785 (SOR ¶ 1.j). Dates of last activity for both credit entries was
May 2015, so they could be the same debt. A credit-card account opened in October 2015
eculizumab, which is a very expensive chemotherapy drug. The TRICARE records show only the charges and
not what TRICARE paid, if anything. Their daughter was listed as an established patient at that time. (AE A.)
(SOR ¶ 1.f) was in collection for $934 due to inactivity since June 2016. Applicant owed
$516 on another credit card with the creditor that was suspended because it was 90 days
past due (SOR ¶ 1.g).5 An unsecured loan obtained for $6,251 in June 2013 was more
than 120 days past due with a balance of $1,301 (SOR ¶ 1.d). No payments had been
made on the debt in the previous two years. Two cellphone accounts from 2013 and 2012
were in collection for $2,336 (SOR ¶ 1.k) and $229 (SOR ¶ 1.h). A cable television and
Internet service provider placed $319 for collection in December 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.l). (GEs 2-
4.)
On August 24, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  He  explained  that  his  spouse  handled  their
finances because of his multiple deployments and security details when he was in the
military. Applicant admitted that he did not pay attention to his bills, and until recently, he
believed that his household finances were in order. He became alerted to some financial
struggles  when  his  vehicle  was  voluntarily  repossessed  in  approximately  2014.  He
regained possession after paying the past-due balance, but his spouse again fell behind on
his loan payments. They then surrendered the vehicle voluntarily, and were led to believe
that the creditor would settle his balance for $3,000. They did not have the funds to make a
lump-sum payment so the unpaid balance accrued to approximately $9,000. Applicant
stated that it was likely that other debts were over 120 days past due or in collection, but he
did  not  know  for  sure.  When  confronted  with  the  debts  on  his credit  record,  Applicant
recalled the utility debt (SOR ¶ 1.i) and a personal loan (SOR ¶ 1.b, possibly duplicated in
SOR ¶ 1.j), which first came to his attention during his 2014 background investigation. He
denied any knowledge of the other delinquencies on his credit record, and explained that
he had not known that his spouse had obtained the credit cards with the creditor in SOR ¶¶
1.f and 1.g.6 (GE 4.)
Applicant told the OPM investigator that he took over the family’s finances in August
2017; that he was surprised to learn that there were delinquent credit-card accounts on his
credit record because his spouse told him she did not have any credit cards; and that he
would contact his creditors to settle his debts. Applicant volunteered that he was granted a
service-connected disability of 90% in August 2017, and that he would make payments
toward his debts on receipt of about $24,000 in expected retroactive disability income. He
added that his spouse had a pending worker’s compensation claim. Applicant showed little
knowledge of his household expenses. He reported monthly income of $1,300 from his
employment and $2,100 per month from his military pension. He acknowledged that he
had been negligent concerning his financial responsibilities, and indicated that resolution of
his debts was largely dependent on his spouse’s settlement of her work injury. (GE 4.)
5 The credit cards are listed as individual accounts on Applicant’s credit record. Neither Applicant nor his
spouse explained how the debts were incurred. It is possible that his spouse was an authorized user on his
accounts, but there is no evidence in that regard.
6 Applicant’s September 2016 credit report (GE 2) lists the accounts as individual accounts, so Applicant either
opened them or his spouse opened them in his name.
For calendar year 2017, Applicant had $78,985 in wage income, $30,708 in military
retirement income, and $11,408 in Veterans Affairs (VA) disability income. His spouse had
her SSDI of $23,782. (AE I.)
In June 2018, Applicant’s spouse had a motor vehicle accident. She testified that
she owed “less than $8,000” on her car loan, but she had let the insurance lapse because
she was considering trading it for another vehicle. She agreed to a voluntary repossession
believing she had equity in the car, but she was held liable for a $29,119 balance on the
loan.  (AE  I;  Tr.  65-66.)  Applicant  and  his  spouse  then  purchased  a  2017  model-year
minivan for her. They obtained a loan for $32,814 at 26% interest. Monthly payments are
$753 per month for 72 months. (GE 3; Tr. 67-69.) Applicant’s spouse’s disability income
covers the monthly payment and insurance on the vehicle. (Tr. 70.)
As  of  September  2018,  Equifax  was  reporting  past-due  balances  of  $9,842  on
Applicant’s  defaulted  car  loan  (SOR  ¶  1.a);  $4,333  on  the  payday  loan  in  SOR  ¶  1.b;
$2,026 on the loan in SOR ¶ 1.d; and $934 and $560 on the credit cards in SOR ¶¶ 1.f and
1.g. Three debts were reportedly in collection: a $229 cellphone debt (SOR ¶ 1.h); a loan
inactive since December 2015 with a balance of $3,596 (SOR ¶ 1.c, no account number
listed); and a cellphone debt from August 2017 with a balance of $1,542 (SOR ¶ 1.e).
Applicant and his spouse dispute the balance of the cellphone debt in SOR ¶ 1.e because
after their contract ended, they returned the cellphones to the provider, who gave them
only the trade-in amount and not what the phones are worth. A collection entity now holds
the debt. (AE I; Tr. 90-91.) The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i-1.l were no longer on Applicant’s credit
report. (GE 3.)
Applicant’s spouse continues to receive medical treatment, but her co-payments are
affordable.  (Tr.  50.)  In  October  2018,  she  had  three  major  surgeries.  She  was  billed
$3,600, although she believes she is legally responsible for only $1,000 of that amount.
She resubmitted a claim to TRICARE. (Tr. 51-52.) She has incurred approximately $2,100
in  dental  expenses  since  October  2018.  (Tr.  80.)  She  estimates  that  they  have  paid
$15,000  in  medical  expenses  over  the  years  for  her  care.  (Tr.  54.)  Applicant  and  his
spouse have not paid any medical expenses for their daughter since 2015. (Tr. 49.)
On October 5, 2018, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant because of the
delinquent  consumer credit  (non-medical) debts  on  his credit  reports totaling  $31,886.
When he responded to the SOR on November 13, 2018, Applicant indicated that he and
his  spouse  had  retained  an  attorney  to  assist  them  in  a  bankruptcy  filing.  (Answer.)
Applicant had previously resisted filing for bankruptcy in the belief that they could repair
their financial situation. After becoming involved in their finances, he realized that their debt
could  not  be  repaid.  (Tr.  118-121.)  Applicant  and  his  spouse  received  $2,938  in  child
support in 2018. Applicant’s wage earnings totaled $63,262. His retirement income was
$31,008, and he received $24,500 in VA disability payments. Applicant’s spouse had only
her  monthly  disability  income,  which  totaled  $7,754.  (AE  I.)  Their  outstanding  debt
exceeded $1.2 million. (AE I.)
As of December 2018, Applicant and his spouse were approximately $629 past due
for  utility  service  at  their  current  residence.  Applicant  arranged  to  repay  the  past-due
balance at $187.24 per month starting in February 2019.7 (AE F; Tr. 77-78.)
On January 15, 2019, Applicant and his spouse retained a bankruptcy attorney at a
fee  of  $2,500  plus  the  $335  bankruptcy  filing  fee.  (AE  H.)  To  assist  in  preparing  their
bankruptcy  petition,  Applicant  and  his spouse obtained their credit reports. Applicant’s
credit report showing five outstanding balances on closed accounts:  SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($9,842);
1.b  ($4,658);  1.d  ($2,180);  1.f  ($934);  and  1.g  ($560).  (AE  E.)  On  February  5,  2019,
Applicant and his spouse obtained the credit counseling required to file for bankruptcy. (AE
G.)
On February 12, 2019, Applicant and his spouse filed a joint Chapter 7 bankruptcy
petition. They listed $44,555 in secured claims: a 401(k) account valued at $19,823;8 the
car purchased in June 2018 on which they owed $32,879; and a 2008 model-year vehicle
on which Applicant owed $3,996.9 They claimed their secured property as exempt from the
bankruptcy. They listed nonpriority unsecured claims totaling $1,218,082, which included a
$1,097,394 medical debt owed to a cancer institute for their daughter’s care;10  the debts in
SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b, 1.d-1.g, 1.i, and 1.k-1.l;11 and a $1,267 credit-card debt of Applicant’s
incurred in March 2013 that was not alleged in the SOR.12  Several other debts belonged to
his spouse, including $45,577 in student loans. They included some medical creditors with
7 Applicant’s spouse initially testified that they had an outstanding utility bill with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.i since
2012 that was rolled into their current account, and that they have been paying an extra $187 per month for
the  last  nine  months  to  repay  the  debt.  (Tr.  37-38.)  However,  documentation  from  the  creditor  shows  a
repayment arrangement to pay $187.24 monthly from February 2019 through December 2019. (AE F.) When
asked on cross-examination about repayment of any of the SOR debts, Applicant’s spouse responded that
payments were made to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.i, but it appears that the $187 payments are to resolve a
recent utility delinquency. (Tr. 77-78.) She admitted that the repayment arrangements were made after they
received the SOR. The full $3,384 utility delinquency (SOR ¶ 1.i) from 2011 is listed on their bankruptcy
petition. (AE I.)
8 Applicant and his spouse listed a $7,680 claim (“401(k) loan”) incurred in June 2018 that is secured by the
$19,823. (AE I.) Applicant’s spouse testified that it is not a 401(k) loan but rather is Applicant’s contribution to
his 401(k). (Tr. 86.)
9  Applicant’s  spouse  testified  that  they  thought  Applicant’s  vehicle  was  paid  off,  but  after  an audit of the
account, they were advised that they owed a balance. She offered to settle with the creditor for $1,300, and
was awaiting a response to her offer as of the hearing. (Tr. 67.) She was told the account had been charged
off in 2015, even though she asserts that they had been making payments on the loan. (Tr. 85-86.)
10 Applicant’s spouse testified that they paid from $200 to $500 a month to the cancer institute at one point in
an effort to keep the debt off their credit reports. (Tr. 81.)
11  Applicant  and  his  spouse  included  among  their  nonpriority  unsecured  debts  a  loan  of  Applicant’s  in
collection for $3,780. It may well be the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c, although it is unclear. They did not include the loan
in SOR ¶ 1.j. Applicant’s spouse asserted it was paid through military allotment before September 2016. (Tr.
74-76.) The loan terms suggest that it is the same debt in SOR ¶ 1.b, which has not been paid and was listed
on their bankruptcy petition. Whether it is a duplicate listing or has been paid, it was no longer listed as a past-
due debt on Applicant’s credit report as of September 2018. (GE 3; AE E.)
12It is unclear whether that account was ever delinquent. It does not appear on Applicant’s credit reports.
no balances listed. Their attorney advised them to list all their medical creditors, even those
that  are  being  repaid.  (Tr.  51.)  In  the  90  days  preceding  their  bankruptcy  filing,  they
reportedly had made payments totaling  $16,169 toward their household expenses and
medical  and  dental bills.  In  the  year before they filed, they gave $9,145 to Applicant’s
mother-in-law to cover their share of the expenses for a family camp; $4,070 to their older
daughter for her rent, daycare, college, and other expenses; $2,200 to Applicant’s sister-in-
law for summer camp for her son with special needs and for repairs to the family camp;
and $10,000 to their younger daughter for her drug rehabilitation, rent, and food. (AE I.) In
response to whether they made any gifts or contributions with a total value exceeding $600
to  any  charity  in  the  two  years  preceding  their  filing,  they  listed  church  donations  of
$12,000. (AE I.) Applicant’s spouse testified discrepantly that the $12,000 was donated
over four years. (Tr. 66.) Applicant and his spouse reported cash assets on hand totaling
$2,230, but one checking account was overdrawn for $103. (AE I.)
Applicant  and  his  spouse  now  handle  their  finances  together.  (Tr.  61.)  Their
combined monthly income is $9,343, and their monthly expenses are $9,257. (AE I.) They
are currently paying an estimated $800 in medical and dental expenses each month. They
lease  their  cellphones,  and  they  pay  $482  a  month  for  cellphone  and  cable  service.
Applicant’s spouse testified that their cellphone and cable television contracts end in March
2019. They plan to change to prepaid phone services at $30 a month since they will own
the phones and to reduce their cable costs by paying only for Internet service. (Tr. 87-88.)
They no longer take out any payday loans. (Tr. 95.) They have never been late on their
rent. (Tr. 72.) Their finances were impacted by the partial government shutdown in January
2019 in that Applicant did not receive his retirement pay on time. (AE M.)
On their bankruptcy petition, Applicant and his spouse reported that they are owed
$7,900 in child support for their granddaughter’s care. (AE I.) They currently receive $188
monthly in child support. (Tr. 61.) Applicant is still owed retroactive disability pay from the
VA for the period June 2016 to July 2017. (Tr. 62, 115.) His spouse received $166,000
from her work-injury settlement after her lawyer took his fee. Applicant’s spouse testified
that the funds went to TRICARE and Medicare for her medical expenses associated with
her accident. (Tr. 63-64.)
Applicant and his spouse owe no past-due taxes, although they anticipate that they
will owe about $1,100 to the Internal Revenue Service for tax year 2018. They plan to
repay any taxes owed under an installment repayment plan. (Tr. 97.)
Applicant’s spouse attended college from 2004 to 2008. She made some student
loan payments of $348 to $412 per month from 2010 until 2017. When the current loan
servicer acquired her loans, her monthly payment ballooned to $756. Her loans were then
placed in forbearance. Applicant and his spouse understand that her student loans will not
be dismissed in their bankruptcy, but they believe the loans might be discharged because
of her disability. (Tr. 97-101.)
Applicant and his spouse provide some financial assistance to their older daughter
when they can. She works as a nurse but is a single mother. (Tr. 98.)
