Applicant  admitted  to  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.~1.d.,  and  1.f.  He  denied
SOR allegation ¶ 1.e. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and
testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  43-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with the defense contractor since 2007. (TR at page 17 line 5 to page 23 line
24, and at page 27 line 3 to page 28 line 22.) Appellant served in the U.S. Army for five
years, achieving the rank of Staff Sergeant, and was deployed to Iraq. (TR at page 24
line 1 to page 27 line 2.) He has held a security clearance since 2002, since joining the
Army  after  “9/11.”  (Id.)  He  is  married  to  a  naturalized  American  citizen,  and  has  three
native-born American children. (TR at page 19 lines 16~20.)
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a.  and  1.b.  Applicant’s  mother-in-law  and  father-in-law  are  citizens  of  China,
but reside in a retirement home in the United States. (TR at page 29 line 20 to page 31
line 11, and at page 34 line 25 to page 35 line 11.) They have “Green Card[s],” and are
seeking to become U.S. citizens. (Id.) All they know about Applicant’s work is that he is
“an  Engineer.”  (TR  at  page  30  line  21  to  page  31  line  1.)  They  never  worked  for  the
Chinese government, nor were members of the Chinese Communist Party. (TR at page
31 lines 2~8.)
1.c.  Applicant’s  brother-in-law  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  China.  He  is  an
“Engineer,” working for a “power company.” (TR at page 31 line 12 to page 32 line 6.)
Applicant has little contact with his brother-in-law, perhaps “once a year . . . during the
holidays.” (Id.)
1.d.  Applicant’s  70-year-old  aunt  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  China.  He  last
contacted her about “15/20 years ago.” (TR at page 32 lines 7~18.)
1.e. Applicant is unsure if he has a bank account in China. He visited China in
2000, and deposited about $3,500 in a bank account to cover his travel expenses. (TR
at  page  32  line  23  to  page  33  line  19.)  His  net  worth  in  the  United  States  is  about
$2,500,000. (TR at page 21 line 24 to page 23 line 19, and at page 35 line 12 to page
36 line 6.)
1.f.  Applicant’s  wife  once  had  a  company  that  partnered  with  a  Chinese
company. That partnership ceased in 2012, about seven years ago. (TR at page 33 line
20 to page 34 line 19, and at 36 lines 8~10.)
Notice
Department  Counsel  has  asked  me  to  take  administrative  notice  about  facts
regarding  China.  China  poses  a  great  espionage  and  cyber-attack  treat  to  the  United
States.  It  is  an  authoritarian  state,  in  which  the  Communist  Party  is  the  paramount
authority.
