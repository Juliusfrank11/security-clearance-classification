Applicant  admitted  some  of  the  SOR  allegations,  with  explanations  and  denied
others.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the
pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  53-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  has  worked  for
this  employer  since  August  2016.  He  was  unemployed  from  November  2015  to  June
2016  and from April to  July  2015.  He  is a high  school graduate. He  is  twice  divorced.
His  first  marriage  was  from  1988  to  1993  and  his  second  marriage  was  from  1994  to
2008. He has three children from each marriage. (Tr. 7, 27-30; GE1)
The SOR alleged Applicant failed to timely file his 2013-2015 federal income tax
returns;  that  he  owes  approximately  $9,725  for  delinquent  federal  taxes  for  tax  years
2014-2017; that he failed to file state income tax returns for tax years 2012-2015; that
he  is  indebted  to  the  state  in  the  amount  of  $840,  for  which  four  state  tax  liens  were
entered;  that  he  has  five  delinquent  debts,  including  past-due  mortgage  payments,  an
auto  repossession  account,  and  three  collection  accounts  totaling  $11,023.  The  SOR
also  alleged,  as  both  personal  and  criminal  conduct  concerns,  that  Applicant  was
charged in 2012 with assault of a family member; in 2004 he was arrested and charged
with  lewdness  involving  a  child;  in  August  2003,  he  was  cited  for  having  an  open
container; in November 1986, he was convicted of shoplifting; and in July 1985 he was
charged  with  being  a  minor  in  possession  of  alcohol.  Applicant’s  admissions  in  his
answer, credit reports, and court and police documents establish the allegations. (Ans.,
GE 3-8)
Financial
Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  difficulties.  He  has  two  earlier  bankruptcy
discharges, a Chapter 7 discharge in 1993 and a Chapter 13 discharge in 2000. (These
bankruptcies  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  so  I  will  not  use  them  as  a  basis  for
disqualification,  but  I  will  use  them  to  assess  Applicant’s  credibility,  the  potential
application  of  mitigating  conditions,  and  in  my  whole-person  analysis)  Applicant
experienced periods of unemployment in 2015 and 2016. Applicant owns a home, which
he  leases  out,  and  some  undeveloped  property  (about  40  acres),  which  he  owns  free
and clear. He pays $900 monthly for a well that is on the land. His take-home monthly
pay  is  approximately  $5,000.  (Tr.  46-48,  51-52,  61,  63;  GE  1,  2,  9)  The  status  of  the
SOR-related debts is as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a (failure to file 2013-2015 federal tax returns):
Applicant  admitted  not  timely  filing  his  federal  tax  returns  and  testified  that
because  of  his  periods  of  unemployment  he  could  not  afford  to  pay  what  he  owed  in
taxes and therefore he did not file his returns for those years, except for tax year 2013.
Applicant provided documentation showing his 2013 federal tax return was timely filed.
He  claims  that  his  2014  and  2015  returns  were  filed  in  March  2017,  but  he  failed  to
provide  supporting  documentation.  He  also  claims  that  his  2016-2018  federal  returns
were timely filed. (Tr. 31-35; GE 2: AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.b (delinquent federal taxes for 2014-2017 in the amount of $9,725):
Applicant  admitted  owing
those  years.  He  provided
documentation showing that he entered into a payment agreement with the IRS in July
2018 to make monthly payments of $130 on his approximately $10,000 delinquent tax
debt.  He  also  documented  regular  payments  from  his  bank  account  to  the  IRS  from
November 2018 to May 2019 of $130. (Tr. 35-38; AE A, G, K)

taxes
for
SOR ¶ 1.c -¶ 1.g (failure to file 2009, 2012-2015 state tax returns and amount owed
to the state documented by four tax liens in 2009, 2013-2015):
Applicant  admitted not  timely  filing  his state tax  returns for the  same  reason he
did not file his federal returns—because he did not have the money to pay them at the
time. He provided documentation showing that he had a zero balance on his state tax
debt as  of  January  2019,  and  that all  the  liens  against  him  were  released  because  all
the  underlying  tax  debt  was  paid.  Several  of  these  debts  were  due  to  Applicant’s
property taxes on the land that he owns not for state income tax debt. (Tr. 20-41; AE B)
SOR ¶ 1.h (auto repossession debt-$6,233):
Applicant  explained  this  debt  arose  when  he  co-signed  on  an  automobile  lease
agreement  for  his  son  in  approximately  2008.  His  son  lost  his  job  and  was  unable  to
continue  making  the  monthly  lease  payments.  In  2009,  he  turned  in  the  car  to  the
leasing company. This was earlier than the contract allowed for. Applicant’s son failed to
make  payments  on  the  remaining  lease  term  and  the  debt  accrued  to  Applicant.
Applicant’s  son  provided  a  letter acknowledging  his responsibility  for the  debt.  (Tr. 53;
AE I)
SOR ¶ 1.i (past-due mortgage payment-$2,322):
Applicant  had  become  past  due  on  his  mortgage  payments  in  the  past.  He
provided  documentation  showing  that  as  of  February  2019,  he  was  current  on  those
payments with no indication of any past-due amount. (Tr. 55; GE 2; AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.j (collection debt-$1,472):
Applicant claims he settled this debt in January 2019 with a collection company
representing  the  creditor.  This  debt  does  not  appear  on  his  March  2019  credit  report.
(Tr. 56; GE 5; AE D)
SOR ¶ 1.k (collection debt-$636):
Applicant claims this debt was for internet equipment that was returned but never
taken off his account. This debt does not appear on his March 2019 credit report. (Tr.
56-57; GE 5; AE H)
SOR ¶ 1.l (collection debt-$360):
Applicant  claims  this  debt  was  for  a  school  fee  attributed  to  his  daughter.  This
debt does not appear on his March 2019 credit report. (Tr. 58; GE 5; AE H)
Personal and Criminal Conduct
In March 2012, Applicant and his stepdaughter got into a dispute at their home.
Each one stuck the other party. The police arrived and cited both parties for disorderly
conduct.  No  prosecution  resulted  but Applicant attended  an  anger management  class.
No further incidents have occurred between the two of them. (Tr. 45-46; GE 2, 8)
In January 2004, Applicant was home with his two stepdaughters (S1 (13 or 14
years old) and S2 (7 or 8 years old)) who were asleep on the couch in the living room.
Applicant tried to wake up the girls and have them move into the bedroom. S1 would not
wake up and remained on the couch. Thereafter, both S1 and S2 told their mother that
Applicant  touched  them  inappropriately.  The  girls  were  interviewed  by  child  protective
services.  S2  recanted her allegations  against  Applicant  and further stated  that S1  had
told her to say that she had been inappropriately touched by Applicant even though she
had  not  been  touched.  Applicant  denied  any  inappropriate  touching  of  the  girls.
Applicant  was  initially  charged  with  lewd  behavior  involving  a  child,  a  misdemeanor  in
March 2004. The charge was dismissed without prejudice in June 2004. Applicant was
never  recharged  with  this  offense.  This  incident  was  investigated  by  the  DOD  in  2009
during  an  earlier investigation.  Applicant  was  not  denied  trustworthiness  determination
because of that incident. (Tr. 44; GE 1-2; AE F)
In August 2003, Applicant was cited for possessing an open alcoholic container.
While  driving  home  from  work,  Applicant  had  an  open  can  of  beer  in  his  car.  He  was
stopped by a law enforcement officer and cited for the open container violation. He went
to court and paid a fine for the infraction. This incident was investigated by the DOD in
2009  during  an  earlier  investigation.  Applicant  was  not  denied  trustworthiness
determination because of that incident. (GE 2; AE F)
Applicant admitted shoplifting four cassette tapes from a local retail store in 1986.
He was charged, pleaded guilty, was fined, and placed on probation for one year. This
incident was investigated by the DOD in 2009 during an earlier investigation. Applicant
was not denied trustworthiness determination because of that incident. (GE 2; AE F)
In July 1985, Applicant was arrested at a party for being a minor in possession of
alcohol  and  misrepresenting  his  age.  He  pleaded  guilty  and  received  a  fine.    This
incident was investigated by the DOD in 2009 during an earlier investigation. Applicant
was not denied trustworthiness determination because of that incident. (GE 2, 6; AE F)
Character Evidence
Applicant provided four letters of support from his work supervisors. All attest that
he  is  a  dedicated  and  reliable  employee  who  performs  hazardous  duties  on  a  daily
basis.  He follows  the  company’s rules  and procedures.  His  operations  manager noted
that Applicant does community volunteer work and is respected for doing so. (AE L)
