Applicant  experienced  financial  difficulties  after  his  discharge  from  the  military.
He  moved  three  times  in  order  to  find  suitable  employment.  He  was  unable  to  keep
tenants in his rental home, and his divorces further contributed to his financial distress.
He also admitted that he was not as good at managing his finances as he could have
been. (Tr. at 18-21, 28-32, 38-39, 43-44, 78-79; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleges  the  mortgage  loan  on  Applicant’s  rental  home  that  was  in
foreclosure and eight delinquent debts  with balances totaling about $32,600. Applicant
admitted owing all the debts except the $186 and $291 debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and
1.h,  which  he  stated  were  fraudulent  accounts.  Except  as  addressed  below,  the
allegations are established through credit reports and Applicant’s admissions.
Applicant lost his rental home to foreclosure in about 2015. Credit reports show a
balance on  the  loan  as  $18,370  after foreclosure  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  He  was  in  contact  with
the  creditor  about  resolving  the  balance,  but  those  negotiations  stopped  after  his
clearance became an issue and his pay decreased. (Tr. at 42-49; Applicant’s response
to SOR; GE 1, 3, 4)
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c allege debts of $13,900 and $9,004 to the same creditor. In
his January 2017 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), he reported that
he  owed  the  creditor  “$20,000  (Estimated).”  He  wrote  that  he  was  “currently  working
with  [creditor]  to  pay  off  all  remaining  debts  and  get  back  in  good  standing.  I  have
allocated  the  vast  majority  of  my  current  earnings  into  that  effort  as  it  is  my  primary
concern.” He further wrote that he “established a once monthly payment with [creditor]
in order to satisfy my debt to them.” He wrote in his January 2019 response to the SOR
that  he  was  working  with  the  creditor  to  pay  the  debts,  and  he  testified  that  he  made
payments. He documented a $400 payment to the creditor on September 18, 2019. (Tr.
at 55-62; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 3, 4; AE F)
Applicant  admitted  owing  the  $5,786  credit  card  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.d.  He
wrote in his response to the SOR that he had contacted the creditor to pay off the debt.
He provided no documentary evidence of payment. (Tr. at 62-63; GE 3, 4)
Applicant settled the $2,518 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e for $881, which he paid in
January 2019. He paid $300 in January 2019 to resolve the $600 debt alleged in SOR ¶
1.f. The disputed $186 and $291 debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h are reported by
Experian  on  the  March  2017  combined  credit  report.  They  are  not  listed  on  the
September  2018  Equifax  credit  report.  (Tr.  at  63-64,  69-71;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 3, 4; AE A, B)
Applicant admitted owing the $379 debt to a pest control company (SOR  ¶ 1.i).
He wrote in his response to the SOR that the debt would be paid within a week. He did
not provide any evidence of payment. (Tr. at 72; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3)
Applicant has worked with a credit repair and monitoring company for some time.
He  stated  that  he  also  received  financial  counseling  from  another  company.  He
estimated  his annual  “take-home”  pay  was  about  $120,000  until  his  income  increased
significantly in about 2018 when his employer sent him on an overseas assignment. He
is a 100% disabled veteran and receives about $3,400 per month from the Department
of Veterans Affairs (VA). He was placed in a lesser-paid position in about October 2018
when  his clearance  became  an  issue.  He  estimated  that he  is currently  earning  about
$65,000  annually  from  his  employer.  He  stated  that  he  plans  to  pay  his  debts.  He
indicated that if he receives his clearance, he will return to a higher-paying job, and he
will be in a better position to pay his debts. (Tr. at 22-25, 33-40, 48-52, 73-75, 79-80)
Applicant testified that he earned almost $200,000 in 2018. He received a federal
income tax refund of about $19,000 from tax year 2017. He stated that he filed his 2018
federal income tax return and expected a refund of about $20,000. He indicated that he
would use part of his refund to pay some of his debts. (Tr. at 66-71, 81-82)
Applicant wrote in a post-hearing e-mail on October 7, 2019, that his “tax return
arrived  last  week  and  [he  had]  been  calling  and  paying  debts  as  rapidly  as  possible.”
(AE  C)  He  was  granted  additional  time  to  submit  additional  information  and
documentation.
Applicant  wrote  another  e-mail  on  November  5,  2019.  He  indicated  that  he
settled  the  $18,370  mortgage  loan  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  for  $9,175,  through  $800  monthly
payments.  He  wrote  that  he  settled  the  $13,900  and  $9,004  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶
1.b and 1.c for $6,500 and $4,502, with monthly payments of the two debts of $1,100.
He also wrote that he paid the $5,786 credit card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d. He did not
submit any supporting documentation. (AE D)
Applicant  was  reminded  of  the  need  for  supporting  documentation,  and  the
deadline for submitting  additional evidence was  extended  again. He  submitted e-mails
on November 18, 2019, and November 19, 2019. He indicated that he was working in a
remote location on a military training event, which made it difficult to send documents.
He  also  stated  that  his  father fell  ill,  and  that  he  was  flying  to  his father’s  location.  He
attached documentation of the $400 payment to the SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c creditor, which
was made on September 18, 2019 (this payment is addressed above). (AE E-G)
The  deadline  for  Applicant  to  submit  additional  evidence  was  extended  to
November 25, 2019, and then again to December 9, 2019. He submitted an e-mail on
December 9, 2019. He wrote that he was “really on track to getting everything paid off
rapidly  now.”  He  also  wrote  that  his  “wife  adjusted  some  of  the  payment  plans  due  to
the  credit  counseling  suggestions.”  The  only  documentation  he  submitted  with  the  e-
mail is information from a financial counseling company, which was dated June 8, 2018.
