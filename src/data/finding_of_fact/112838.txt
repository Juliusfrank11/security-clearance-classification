Applicant denied the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b and admitted the allegation
in  ¶  1.c.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 46 years old. He served on active duty in the military from 1991 until
he retired honorably in 2011. He married in 1993 and has a grown daughter. He divorced
in 1998. He remarried in 1999 and divorced in 2011. There were no children from this
marriage. He has worked for a federal contractor since 2011.2
Applicant and his first wife filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1994 and their debts were
discharged the same year. Applicant and his second wife filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in
August 2000. It was converted to Chapter 7 in 2002, and their debts were discharged in
2003. In 2005, Applicant and his wife purchased a house and secured two mortgages.
Applicant claimed his wife had a spending problem. While he worked overseas, he would
return home and would notice large purchases had been made.3
In August 2007, Applicant and his wife filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which included
a  payment plan for the  two  mortgages  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  ($77,623)  and  1.b  ($22,768))  that
were in arrears. They did not complete the terms of the Chapter 13 bankruptcy because
they  filed  for  divorce.  The  divorce  decree  terms  stated  that  Applicant  would  make  the
mortgage payments through September 2011. His wife was granted exclusive possession
of the house until their bankruptcy discharge or she refinanced it by May 2014. If the wife
could not refinance the mortgages or was 30 days or more late on a payment, then the
house would be sold and the proceeds of the sale were to be split. Applicant would be
responsible for the mortgage payments during the pendency of the sale of the house or
if  the  wife  refinanced  the  home  by  May  1,  2014.  The  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  was
dismissed in November 2011 for failure to make payments.4
Applicant’s testimony was he had no idea when his wife moved out of the house.
He said the house was sold, but he had no idea when or the amount it was sold for. He
said after his divorce, his ex-wife filed bankruptcy.  His understanding was the debts in

SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b were charged off. He believed that meant they were gone. He said
he now understands the mortgages or a portion were not paid. When asked if he had any
intention of paying the debts, he stated “Probably not, Your Honor. It’s a lot of money.”5
He said his ex-wife surrendered the house in her bankruptcy, and the debts were charged
off. He said he reached out to the creditors in 2012 regarding keeping the house, but they
were unwilling to work with him because  of his ex-wife’s bankruptcy. He was aware in
2012 that the debts were on his credit report. Applicant never followed up on the status
of the two mortgages or his financial responsibility to the creditors.6
Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in August 2016. In it
he  disclosed  the  mortgage  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.  He  stated  that  the  house  was
awarded in his divorce to his ex-wife with a contingency that she refinance it in her name.
He  said  she  subsequently  filed  bankruptcy  and  surrendered  the  property.  He  was
attempting to remove the debt from his credit report. He did not provide evidence of what
he did.7
During Applicant’s March 2018 background investigation, he told the government
investigator that his ex-wife was supposed to pay for the mortgages, but she defaulted on
the  loans.  He  said  the  loans  were  in  both  of  their  names.  He  was  given  time  by  the
investigator to produce documents regarding his Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but did not.8
During Applicant’s background interview, he was confronted with the debt in SOR
¶ 1.c. He told the investigator that this was an energy bill. He said he checks his credit
report once a week, and this debt was not on it. He was given time to produce supporting
documentation to the investigator and did not. He said he would inquire about the account.
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debt in ¶ 1.c. At this hearing, he denied
the debt and said he was contesting it.9
A credit report from October 2016 reports the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a as charged off in
December 2013. It reports the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b as past due in the amount of $1,915. A
credit report from June 2018 reports the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a as charged off and the debt in
¶ 1.b as in collection.10
Applicant was provided an opportunity to provide documents to show the current
status of the mortgage debts and whether he owed any deficiency. He did not provide

any information. He did not provide any documents to dispute the debts in the SOR or
proof of payment.11
