Applicant  is  56  years old.  No  information  was  provided  about his education. He
has been employed as a senior systems engineer by a federal contractor since October
2016.  He  reported  a  previous  assignment  with  a  federal  contractor  at  a  military
academy from December 2005 to October 2016. Applicant served honorably on active
duty in the U.S. Air Force from 1981 to 1985. He reports a previous security clearance
from his time in the service, with no issues. Applicant has been married since February
2019, and he has two adult daughters.
Applicant reported one credit-card debt owed to a bank that was more than 120
days delinquent (SOR ¶ 1.b) in section 26 of his security clearance application (SCA).2
The  SOR  alleged  10  delinquent  debts  totaling  $12,305.  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,
Applicant admitted all of the ten delinquencies alleged in the SOR and the falsification
alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a. Applicant claims to be working on resolving his delinquent debts.
He stated that his wife’s business took losses.3 No further information was provided. He
provided  no  documentation  to  substantiate  any  efforts  to  contact  creditors  or  resolve
these  delinquencies.  No  information  was  provided  to  amplify  or  elaborate  on  the
reasons for his delinquent debts, or any repayment plans.
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the past-due account in the amount
of $241 owed to a housing agency at SOR ¶ 1.i, but states that he is current now. It is
unclear  what  progress  has  been  made  on  this  debt  because  no  documentation  has
been provided.  Applicant has provided no explanation or documentary evidence either
with his Answer to the SOR or in response to the FORM. Applicant admitted to all of the
other SOR delinquent debts, and they are confirmed in his credit reports. He provided
no evidence of financial counseling or budget showing income against expenses.
