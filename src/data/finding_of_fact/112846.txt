Applicant  is  a  26-year-old  single  man.  He  works  for  a  defense  contractor  as  a
shipping  and  receiving  clerk.  (Tr.  14)  After  Applicant  graduated  from  high  school,  he
enrolled in college. His parents agreed to help him finance the first three years of college,
and he was to be solely responsible for the remainder. He attended college, but did not
graduate. Working a minimum wage job, he was unable to keep up with his student loans.
By March 2018, Applicant was delinquent on five student-loan accounts totaling
approximately  $40,000,  as  alleged  in  SOR  subparagraphs  1.a  through  1.e.  (GE  3)
Additionally, he had incurred two delinquent credit card debts totaling approximately $3,500
(SOR subparagraphs 1.f and 1.g),  and a delinquent $50 medical bill (SOR subparagraph
1.g).
Applicant began his current job in November 2017. He continued working at his part-
time  job.  Working  both  jobs  enabled  him  to  begin  resolving  his  delinquent  debts.  He
consolidated all of the student-loan debts in May 2018. One month later, he began making
monthly $138 payments. (AE A) He has been consistently making payments since then,
and the student loan debts, as consolidated, are no longer in delinquent status.
As for the credit card debt alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.f, Applicant has made 11
payments totaling $900, since May 2018. (AE B)  He began resolving subparagraph 1.g,
totaling $472 through partial payments beginning in May 2018. (GE C) Unable to identify
the  current  creditor  of  the  medical  bill  alleged  in  SOR  subparagraph  1.h,  Applicant  is
looking into formally disputing it. (AE D)
Applicant’s full-time job pays $46,000 annually. In sum, he has approximately $300
of monthly discretionary income. (Tr. 38) Recently, he started an auto-detailing business.
Although he has yet to generate a profit, he intends to use any prospective income to help
to continue to satisfy his debts. (Tr. 36)
Applicant smoked marijuana with varying degrees of frequency from 2011 to 2017.
His use from 2011 to 2015 occurred while he was in college. He stopped using marijuana
for approximately nine months in November 2016 before using it once more on his birthday
in September 2017. He has not used marijuana since then.
Applicant now devotes his time to working and satisfying his debt. Typically, after
one job ends at 4:00 pm, he goes “straight to the next job at 5:30 [pm].” (Tr. 42) Consumed
with working multiple jobs, he has no time to socialize with friends with whom he used
marijuana in the past. He has no intention of using marijuana in the future because “it’s not
. . . conducive to the career that [he is] trying to have.” (Tr. 17)
