In Applicant’s answer to the SOR,  he admitted both allegations. His admissions
in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  52-year-old  piping  designer  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since September 2016. His supervisor, who has known him for more than 10 years and
supervised him since early 2018, submitted a letter stating that he has “never observed
any behavior that would cause concern or preclude [Applicant] from obtaining a security
clearance.” (AX A.)
Applicant’s work history in his SCA reflects unemployment from January to April
2009, September to December 2014, and February to August 2016. He has lived with a
cohabitant since October 1998. He has no children. He received a security clearance in
August 2007.
When Applicant submitted his SCA, he disclosed that he failed to file his federal
income  tax  return  for  2015  and  pay  the  taxes  due.  He  explained  that  he  was
unemployed  and  could  not  afford  to  pay  the  taxes  due.  (GX  1  at  39.)  In  response  to
DOD CAF  interrogatories,  he  estimated  that he  earned  about  $65,000  during  tax  year
2015. (GX 2 at 5.)
When Applicant answered the SOR, he stated that he had contacted the IRS to
resolve  his  delinquent  tax  debt.  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  submitted  evidence  that  he
filed his federal income tax returns for 2015 through 2018 and mailed them to the IRS
on June 5, 2019. They were received by the IRS on June 10, 2019. (AX G.) He testified
that  he  filed  his  federal  returns  in  April  2019,  but  that  they  apparently  were  lost,
requiring that he file them again. (Tr. 26.)
Applicant  owes  $17,299  in  federal  income  taxes  for  2015  and  $8,415  for  2017.
(AX C at 6, 9-14, 25, 31.) He owed $1,728 for 2016, and he made credit-card payments
of $1,000 and $728 on April 17, 2019, which paid his 2016 tax debt in full. (AX C at 1-5,
15, and 22; Tr. 12.)
Applicant  owed  $10,739  for  2018  federal  income  taxes.  (AX  C  at  36.)  He
submitted evidence  that  he made  credit-card  payments  of  $4,739  and  $3,000  on  April
15, 2019, for tax year 2018, leaving a federal tax debt of about $3,000 for that year. (AX
C at 1-5.)
Applicant  estimated  that  his  credit-card  payments  attributable  to  the  tax
payments for 2018  and  2016  would  be about  $600  per month,  and  that  it  will  take  six
years  to  pay  off  the  credit-card  balances.  (Tr.  35.)  After  the  hearing,  he  submitted
evidence that he established an online payment agreement with the IRS in June 2019.
His evidence does not reflect the amount or  duration of the payments or the tax years
covered by the agreement. (AX F.)
In  April  2019,  Applicant  filed  his  state  income  tax  returns  for  2016,  2017,  and
2018. He owes $424 for 2016, $424 for 2017, and $588 for 2018. He has not yet filed
his state return for 2015, and he has not yet paid any of the state taxes due. (Tr. 28-30.)
Applicant  testified  that  his  periods  of  unemployment  required  that  he  use  his
savings  for  living  expenses  and  his  medical  expenses  as  a  Type  I  diabetic,  leaving
insufficient funds to pay his federal income taxes. When he found employment in 2016,
he  “maxed  out”  his  dependents  and  worked  overseas  for  two  years,  causing  his  tax
problems to “snowball.” (Tr. 17.) He has now amended his exemptions to zero. (Tr. 33.)
Applicant received DOHA interrogatories about his taxes in September 2018. He
testified that he “started trying to get the ball rolling” after receiving the interrogatories,
but he did not begin to take action to file the past-due returns until March 2019 because
his job required frequent travel. (Tr. 31-32.)
Applicant testified that his cohabitant is employed, but that he usually pays for all
their living expenses. (Tr. 23.) He recently leased a new car for his cohabitant, making a
down  payment  of  $5,000.  (Tr.  25.)  In  his  post-hearing  submission,  he  stated  that  his
cohabitant has begun making the lease payments. (AX D.) The record does not reflect
the amount of his monthly lease payments. He and his cohabitant vacationed overseas
in August 2018 at a cost of about $4,500. (Tr. 24-25.)
