Applicant is 52 years old. He was married from 1990 to 2017. (Tr. 44) His wife is
deceased. He has two adult children that live with him. (Tr. 45) Applicant obtained his
Bachelor’s  degree  in  electrical  engineering  in  1988.  (Tr.  43)  He  reports  no  military
service.  He  has  been  employed  as  an  engineer  for  a  major  federal  contractor  for  22
years. (Tr. 41) He received exemplary performance evaluations. He provided a resume

The SOR alleges four delinquent debts totaling $394,812 including a charged-off
mortgage  loan  at  SOR  ¶  1.a,  in  the  amount  of  $239,347,  and  a  charged-off  second
mortgage  on  the  same  property  at  SOR  ¶  1.b.  It  also  alleges  a  related  debt  in  the
amount  of  $69,648  placed  for  collection  at  SOR  ¶  1.d.  Applicant  co-invested  in  two
homes  with  others  in  2006,  and  he  purchased  a  third  home  himself  that  year,  at  the
height of the housing market bubble. (Tr. 36) This was an investment strategy launched
when  the  properties  were  appreciating  in  value.  Almost  immediately,  the  market
crashed  with  the  subprime  mortgage  scandal  of  2008  and  ensuing  financial  collapse.
Applicant  and  his  co-investor  sold  the  first  house  and  he  incurred  a  loss  of  a  few
hundred  dollars.  (Tr.  50)  They  sold  the  second  house  around  2009  and  he  incurred  a
loss of approximately $15,000. (Tr. 48)
Applicant owned house number three (# 3) alone. It was losing value rapidly. He
tried  a  short  sale  of  the  property  but  was  informed  that  he  would have  to  stop  making
payments. He did so, but the lender would not agree to the short sale anyway. (Tr. 52)
In  2012,  Applicant  was  struggling  to  make  mortgage  payments  because  his  overtime
opportunities decreased. He obtained a home-equity line of credit (HELOC) of $98,700
to use for mortgage payments on house # 3. (Tr. 21, 53) He knew it was depreciating
but  hoped  that  the  market  would  recover.  (Tr.  54)  He  tried  to  sell  it  but  received  no
offers.  Eventually,  he  gave  up  and  both  the  primary  and  second  loan  were  defaulted.
He  allowed  it  to  go  to  a  foreclosure-auction  sale  in  February  2014.  (Tr.  56)  Applicant
had the two Bank of America (BOA) mortgage loans on the property totaling $300,000.
(Tr. 57) A loan-servicing company bought house # 3 for $120,000 at the auction.
Applicant  testified  that  shortly  after the foreclosure  sale he  received  a  packet  in
the  mail  from  an  unknown  loan-servicing  or  collection  agent  at  SOR  ¶  1.d  (D.O.)
demanding that he pay approximately $230,000, which presumably was for the balance
he  owed  after  foreclosure  on  the  two  mortgage  loans.  (Tr.  57,  67)  Applicant  assumed

security clearance application (SCA) (GE 1).
the  amount  was  incorrect  and  he  discarded  this  mail  in  2014.  (Tr.  67,  70)  He  was
confused  and  thought  that  “charged-off”  on  his  credit  report  meant  forgiven.  He  also
thought  that  aged-off  his  credit  report  accounts  were  closed.  (Tr.  58,  76)  He  did  not
contact D.O. or the BOA or anybody else from 2014 until late 2018 to try to resolve this
deficiency that he knew he owed. (Tr. 68) He admitted that he should have been more
proactive. (Tr. 70)
After  his  clearance  interview  in  June  2018,  Applicant  began  to  put  the  pieces
together  and  realized  that  D.O.  was  a  collection  agent  for  BOA  or  its  successor
creditors. Still he took no action. (Tr. 62) After receipt of the SOR in October 2018, he
contacted D.O. and settled the primary mortgage for $33,000 on February 27, 2019. (Tr.
58) He provided a copy of the compromise and settlement agreement reflecting that the
original  mortgage  loan  debt  of  $263,992  was  settled  for  $33,000.  (AE  B)  He  has  not
received an IRS Form 1099 for this income (resulting from forgiven debt) yet. (Tr. 76-77)
SOR  ¶  1.b  was  a  charged-off  debt  in  the  amount  of  $83,101  for  the  second
mortgage  loan  on  house  #  3.  Applicant  testified  that  he  only  recently  started
communicating with BOA representatives in an effort to resolve this long-standing debt.
(Tr.  75)  He provided  a  packet  of  correspondences  with  BOA and  its  various  collection
agents  showing  his  efforts  to  resolve  this  matter.  (AE  A,  AE  D)  (Tr.  33-35)  It  remains
unresolved.
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  a  charged-off  credit-card  account  in  the  amount  of  $2,716.
Applicant testified that he paid this debt in full on March 13, 2017. (Tr. 20) He explained
that  this  was  a  credit-card  debt  run  up  by  his  late  wife  without  his  knowledge.  He
provided  documentary  evidence  attached  to  his  answer  to  the  SOR  reflecting  that  the
account now has a zero balance and it is paid in full.
Applicant attached several documents to his November 2018 answer to the SOR
including;  a  copy  of  a  certificate  showing  that  he  completed  a  few  hours  of  financial
counseling  on  November  8,  2018;  pay  stubs  reflecting  his  gross  pay  of  $5,413  every
two weeks; a personal financial statement reflecting a current mortgage of $153,000 on
his  primary  home;  a  stocks  and  bonds  investment  portfolio  and  401(k)  account
statement reflecting that Applicant has assets valued at well over $2 million, plus other
bank account and IRA statements showing his substantial net worth.
