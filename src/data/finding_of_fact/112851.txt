Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations,  with  explanations,  and  his  admissions
are  incorporated  into  these  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He began working
at his present job in  November 2016. He served in the Air Force from 1982 until 1995
when  he  was  passed  over  for  promotion  to  major.  He  separated  with  an  honorable
discharge. He joined the Air Force Reserve in 1998 and earned a retirement. In 2003,
he deployed to Iraq, while a reservist, and was awarded a meritorious service medal for
his actions. He begins receiving retired pay later this month when he turns 60 years old.
He has a master’s degree. He was married in 1982 and divorced in 1994. He remarried
in  1995  and  divorced  in  2016.  He  has  eight  children  from  both  marriages.  Two  are
minors for whom he pays child support.1
The SOR alleged Applicant: filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in August 1996,
which resulted in a discharge in November 1996; filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition
in October 2002, which was dismissed in May 2003; and filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy
petition in May 2003, which resulted in a discharge in November 2006. The SOR also
alleged  the  following  delinquent  debts:  a  consumer  collection  debt  of  approximately
$17,249;  a  collection  account  to  a  state  for  unpaid  child  support  of  approximately
$1,054;  a  delinquent  debt  from  a  deficiency  on  a  repossessed  car  of  approximately
$13,149;  and  two  delinquent  medical  debts  of  approximately  $1,599  and  $105.  The
bankruptcies  are  supported  by  court  filings  and  the  debts  were  listed  in  credit  reports
from March 2017 and July 2018.2
Applicant credibly explained that he filed his 1996 Chapter 7 bankruptcy because
of debts he incurred during his first marriage. His 2002 Chapter 13 bankruptcy was filed
and  soon  dismissed  for  a  procedural  irregularity.  It  was  refiled  in  May  2003  and  the
repayment plan was successfully completed leading to Applicant’s discharge of debts in
November  2006.  Applicant  filed  for  bankruptcy  in  2002-2003  because  after  “9-11”  he
went through a period of unemployment and underemployment leading to his financial
difficulties. He has had no further bankruptcy filings.3

The status of his delinquent debts is as follows:
Child  Support-$1,054  (SOR  1.f).  Applicant  credibly  explained  that  he  became
delinquent on his child support when he was laid off from his job in February 2015 and
could  only  secure  a  minimum  wage  job  until  he  was  hired  by  his  current  employer  in
November  2016.  At  one  point  his  arrearages  were  approximately  $10,000.  He
documented that automatic payments from his paycheck have paid the arrearages and
that  he  is  current  on  his  monthly  child  support  payments  of  approximately  $366.  This
debt is being resolved.4
Consumer  account-$17,249  (SOR  1.d).  Applicant  credibly  explained  that  this
was an SUV trailer that he and his wife purchased during his second marriage. At some
point  he  was  unable  to  make  the  payments  and  it  was  repossessed.  He  documented
that  any  remaining  obligation  was  assumed  by  his  ex-wife  and  that  she  included  this
debt in her 2014 Chapter 13 bankruptcy. This debt is resolved.5
Repossession account-$13,149 (SOR 1.h). Applicant credibly disputed that this
was a repossession account. He admitted that he got behind on his car payments and
the  bank  intended  to  repossess  this  car,  but  his  father  secured  a  loan  to  pay  the  car
loan  and  Applicant  reimbursed  his father.  He  documented  the  payment  to  pay  the  car
loan. This debt is resolved.6
Medical  accounts-$1,599;  $105  (SOR  1.e  and  1.g).  Applicant  incurred  these
medical bills when he was out of work. He talked to the providing facility and it indicated
the bill would be taken care of. When he was made aware the debts were on his credit
report,  he  disputed  the  debts.  Those  disputes  are  documented  on  his  credit  report.
These debts are being resolved.7
Applicant provided a written budget, which shows that he has a monthly residual
of approximately $200. He begins receiving his military retirement pay of approximately
$3,300  monthly  in  June  2019,  which  will  up  his  monthly  residual  amount.  Although  a
past-due amount is reflected on his most recent credit report for a mortgage (not alleged
in  the  SOR),  that  debt  is  the  responsibility  of  his  second  ex-wife  as  indicated  in  their
divorce  settlement.  He  received  financial  counseling  as  part  of  his  bankruptcy.
Applicant’s  2018  job  appraisal  rated  him  an  overall  “4”  indicative  of  his  “high
performance.”8
