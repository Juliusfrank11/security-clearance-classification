The  SOR  identified  two  allegations  under  this  guideline  concerning  Applicant’s
failure to file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2017.
In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admits  each  of  the  allegations.    Applicant  states
that he has no excuse for failing to file his income tax returns for so many years.
Applicant has been married for 34 years and has three adult children.  He states
that he has always met his financial obligations and has never lived beyond his means.
In  2009,  Applicant  was  one  of  thousands  of  victims  effected  by  an  elaborate,  now
famous,  “ponzi  scheme”  engineered  by  the  chairman  of  a  large  financial  firm.    That
chairman  is  now  in  prison.    Applicant  had  been  a  financial  advisor  at  the  firm  from
March  2009  to  December  2009  with  his  business  partners,  when  Federal  authorities
seized the firm.  Applicant resigned from his position and was unemployed for the next
11  months.    With  his  business  ruined,  he  returned  to  the  commercial  real  estate
business.
Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns for tax years, 2008, 2009,
2010,  2011,  2012,  2013,  2014,  2015,  2016  and  2017.    He  also  failed  to  file  his  state
income tax returns for tax years 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and
2017.  He has no excuse for not timely filing his Federal and state income tax returns.
In the years from 2008 to 2012, he states that he did not have any net taxable liability to
the Federal government or the state.  As time passed, he failed to organize himself and
procrastinated  on  filing,  which  eventually  snowballed  into  his  current  situation.    He
rationalized  that  since  he  did  not  owe  much,  if  anything,  to  the  taxing  authorities,  he
would get to it the next year.  He found that tracking down the information after so long
without filing was difficult.
In  November  2016,  Applicant  started  his  current  job  that  he  understood  would
require a security clearance.  In January 2019, Applicant filed all past-due Federal and
state income tax returns.  Applicant has made all payments including late filing penalties
to the state.  Applicant also learned that his procrastination cost him a refund he would
have received for six years out of the ten that he failed to file.  Applicant states that he
has  also  filed  his  Federal  income  tax  returns  in  question  and  has  paid  all  taxes  owed
including  penalties  except  for  2017,  which  he  expected  to  pay  in  the  near  future.
Applicant believes that his failure to file his income tax returns in a timely manner has
cost him approximately $60,000 in tax refunds.
Applicant  regrets  his  past  misconduct  and  is  remorseful  about  his  failure  as  a
citizen to pay his taxes and file his income tax returns on time.
