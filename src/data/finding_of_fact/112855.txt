In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.k
and  1.n.  He  admitted  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  2.a  with  an  explanation.  He  denied  the
allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.m,  1.n,  and  1.o.  His  admissions  in  his  answer  and  at  the
hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  financial  analyst  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  June
2018. (Tr. 29.) He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from April 1990 to April 1994
and was honorably discharged. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy Reserve (USNR) in 1996.
He worked for a utility company from December 1999 until he was called to active duty
in  the  USNR  in  February  2009.  He  remained  on  active  duty  in  various  locations  until
June 2015. In August 2015, he retired from the USNR as a petty officer first class (pay
grade E-6).
Applicant worked for a short time as a deputy sheriff after he was released from
active duty. He worked for a defense contractor from December 2015 to October 2016.
He was a civilian employee of the U.S. Navy from October 2016 until he was terminated
in  September  2017.  He  was  then  employed  by  a  defense  contractor from  February  to
June  2018,  when  he  began  his  current  job.  He  received  a  security  clearance  at  the
beginning of his active duty in 1990.
Applicant  married  in  August  2005,  separated  in  January  2016,  and  is  now
divorced.  No  children  were  born  during  the  marriage.  While  married,  he  had  four
stepchildren, ages 28, 27, 21, and 20.
The  SOR  alleges  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  petition,  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy
petition,  and  12  delinquent  debts  reflected  in  credit  reports from  January  2018  (GX  3)
and September 2018 (GX  2.) The evidence reflecting  the  bankruptcies  and  delinquent
debts is summarized below.
1  Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  security  clearance  application  (GX  1)  unless
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b: Bankruptcies. Applicant and his wife filed a joint Chapter
13  bankruptcy  petition  in  February  2014,  and  it  was  dismissed  in  October  2014  for
failure  to  make  payments.  They  intentionally  stopped  making  payments  when  they
decided that a Chapter 7 bankruptcy better suited their financial needs. They filed a joint
Chapter  7  bankruptcy  petition  in  November  2014,  and  they  received  a  discharge  in
March 2015. Their petition listed assets of $96,862 and liabilities of $419,060. The debts
included  first  and  second  mortgages  on  a  home,  multiple  vehicle  repossessions,
medical  and  dental  bills,  debts  related  to  care  and  maintenance  of  horses  and  other
animals, utility bills, and various consumer debts.
Applicant attributed the bankruptcies to delinquent debts his wife brought into the
marriage and her surreptitious and excessive spending after they were married. (Tr. 36,)
The  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  petition  reflects  student  loans  incurred  by  his  ex-wife  from
2003-2007 totaling $57,413. All other debts attributed to his ex-wife (a student loan for
$17,766;  an  overpayment  by  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs;  and  multiple  credit-
card accounts and collection accounts) were incurred after their marriage. (GX 5.)
SOR  ¶¶  1.c-1.j:  Eight delinquent  student  loans  totaling about  $28,565.  The
September 2018 credit report reflects that Applicant has disputed these debts. (GX 2.)
The record does not reflect the basis for the disputes. Applicant testified that he began
incurring  student  loans  in  1998  or  1999  and  that  his  last  student  loan  was  incurred  in
2005. (Tr. 48.) He earned an associate’s degree in June 2010 and took some additional
courses  after  receiving  his  degree.  Payments  on  the  loans  were  deferred  until  about
2012.  (Tr.  50.)  He  did  not  contact  the  lenders  or  collection  agencies  until  he  began
gathering  information  for  his  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  petition  in  2015.  (Tr.  51.)  He
contacted  the  collection  agencies  again  after  he  received  his  Chapter  7  discharge.  In
August  2018,  he  entered  into  a  rehabilitation  program  providing  for  ten  consecutive
monthly $36 payments. He had made four payments by automatic debit as of the date
of the hearing. (AX D; Tr. 52-55.)
SOR ¶ 1.k: Car loan charged off for $147. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant
stated that this was a car loan he co-signed for his ex-wife. The creditor for this debt is
the  same  as  the  creditor  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.o.  This  debt  was  for  a  vehicle  that  was
returned to the dealer as a “lemon.” (GX 1 at 43.) It appears to have been included in
the judgment alleged in SOR ¶ 1.o.
SOR  ¶  1.l:  Government  debt  of  $91  referred  for  collection.  In  his  answer  to
the  SOR,  Applicant  stated  that  this  debt  was  for  his  wife’s  uniforms  when  she  was
employed  at  a  military  hospital.  (Tr.  58.)  He  has  taken  no  action  to  dispute  it  or
otherwise resolve it.
SOR  ¶  1.m:  Government  debt  for  $85.  This  debt  is  listed  in  the  credit  report
from  January  2018  as  a  “government  miscellaneous  debt.”  (GX  3  at  6.)  Applicant
testified  that  he  contacted  the  collection  agency  listed  in  the  credit  report  and  was
informed that this debt was incurred by his ex-wife when she was employed at a military
hospital. (Tr. 59.) He has taken no action to dispute or otherwise resolve it.
SOR  ¶  1.n:  Medical  bill  referred  for  collection  of  $118.  The  January  2018
credit report reflects that this debt was “open” as of November 2014 and was included in
a  bankruptcy  petition.  (GX  3  at  10.)  Applicant’s  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  petition  did  not
specifically  list  this  debt,  but  it  would  have  been  discharged  in  March  2015.  Absent
fraud,  in  a  no-asset  bankruptcy,  all  unsecured,  nonpriority  debts  are  discharged  when
the  bankruptcy  court  grants  a  discharge,  even  if  they  are  not  listed  on  a  bankruptcy
schedule. See Judd v. Wolfe, 78 F.3d 110, 114 (3d Cir. 1996); Francis v. Nat’l Revenue
Service,  Inc.,  426  B.R.  398  (Bankr.  S.D.  FL  2010).  The  debt  is  not  reflected  in  the
September 2018 credit report. (GX 2.)
SOR  ¶  1.o:  Judgment  for  $18,998  for  a  delinquent  car  loan.  This  judgment
was  entered  against  Applicant  and  his  wife  in  January  2016.  (GX  4.)  In  his  answer  to
the SOR, Applicant stated that this debt was for his wife’s vehicle but that he co-signed
the  loan.  Their  separation  agreement  makes  no  provision  for  disposition  of  motor
vehicles or assignment of responsibility for joint debts. (AX E.) The court records reflect
that  a  default  judgment  was  entered,  but  Applicant  testified  that  he  appeared  in  court
but his wife did not. He also testified that, after his court appearance, he discussed the
debt  with  the  creditor’s  representative  and  was  informed  that  he  would  be  contacted
after the  vehicle  was  sold, but  that he had no further  communication  with  the  creditor.
(Tr. 63.) He did not contact the creditor again until he received the amended SOR. (Tr.
95.)  In  a  post-hearing  submission,  Applicant  stated  he  contacted  the  creditor  and
learned that the car was auctioned for $9,800. The creditor is willing to make a payment
agreement,  but  Applicant  will not  be  able  to  afford any  payments until mid-June 2019.
(AX A.) The debt is not resolved.
Applicant’s net pay is about $3,150 per month. He receives $1,384 per month for
a service-connected disability. He has a pension account from a previous employer that
totals  about  $21,000,  but  he  will  not  use  it  to  pay  his  delinquent  bills  because  of  the
adverse consequences of an early withdrawal. (Tr. 64-65.)
Applicant did not file his federal income tax returns for 2015, 2016, and 2017 on
time. He testified that his ex-wife was uncooperative in providing the documentation for
the years they were married, and he finally decided to file separately. (Tr. 66-68.), The
IRS filed a substitute tax return for him in January 2018, and he filed his 2015 return in
August 2018. (AX I.) He filed his 2016 return in November 2018 and his 2017 return in
June 2018. (AX G; AX H.) He filed his 2018 return on time, and he does not owe any
federal  income  taxes.  He  owed  about  $330  for  tax  year  2015,  but  it  was  satisfied  by
application of refunds for subsequent tax years. (AX F.)
Applicant  admitted  that  he  answered  “No”  to  a  question  in  his  SCA  asking
whether he had failed to file returns or pay federal, state, or other taxes. He attributed
his  answer  to  a  mistake  and  admitted  that  he  should  have  answered  “Yes.”  He
answered  “Yes”  to  a  question  whether  he  was  currently  delinquent  on  any  debt,
because he knew he owed taxes of about $330 for 2015. (Tr. 70-71.)
When  Applicant  was  hired  as  a  civilian  employee  of  the  Navy  in  October  2016,
he was a probationary employee. In August 2017, he was terminated for unsatisfactory
performance  and  disorderly  and  unprofessional  conduct  on  two  occasions.  The
termination notice recites that  he leapt from his chair during a meeting, shouted at his
supervisor, and pointed his finger in her face. (GX 6.) At the hearing, Applicant testified
that his supervisor berated him at length in the presence of co-workers, cursed at him,
and  used  the  “f”  word.  At  that  point,  he  stood  up,  told  her  that  he  “had  enough  of  her
language,” and walked out of her office. (Tr. 23.)
Applicant  has  filed  a  complaint  with  the  Equal  Employment  Opportunity
Commission  (EEOC).  His  complaint  is  pending  decision  by  an  EEOC  administrative
judge.  In  the  complaint,  Applicant  contends  that  he  was  the  victim  of  trumped-up
charges  in  retaliation  for  accusing  his  supervisor  of  subjecting  him  to  discrimination,
harassment,  and  a  hostile  work  environment  based  on  his race  (Caucasian), age  (47)
and sex (male). His supervisor was a 49-year-old African-American female. He accused
his  supervisor  of  using  abusive  and  foul  language,  i.e.,  repeated  use  of  the  “f”  word,
berating  him  in  the  presence  of  co-workers,  falsely  accusing  him  of  mishandling  a
travel-document  situation  that  occurred  on  a  ship  that  was  not  under  his  authority,
falsely  accusing  him  of  recording  his  sick  leave  incorrectly,  refusing  to  approve  leave,
and  harassing  him  about  taking  leave.  (AX  C.)  The  record  reflects  that  his  supervisor
was reprimanded in July 2014 for similar conduct. (AX C, Enclosure 2.)
