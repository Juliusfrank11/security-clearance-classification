Applicant denied the sole SOR allegation. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 64 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1977 and two master’s
degrees  in  1982  and  1986.  He  married  in  1998  and  has  two  children  ages  19  and  17
years old. Applicant has been employed since August 2016 by a federal contractor. (Item
2)
Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in January 2017. In it
he  disclosed  the  delinquent  credit  card  debt  alleged  in  the  SOR  (¶  1.a.-$26,019).  He
stated  the  reason  for  his  failure  to  pay  the  debt  was  because  he  was  out  of  work.  In
response to the inquiry to provide the current status of the financial issue, he stated: “I
am planning to file for bankruptcy when the time is right.” (Item 1)
In November 2017, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He
told the investigator that his finances were “okay” and he could pay his current bills on
time,  but  could  not  afford  to  pay  down  his  past  debt.  He  acknowledged  he  owed
approximately $26,000 for a credit card bill that was in collection status. He explained that
in 2008, he was laid off and used the credit card to make up for his lack of pay and to
purchase general household items. He stopped making payments on the bill in February
2014.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  could  not  afford  to  pay  this  debt  and  did  not
anticipate being able to pay the debt down or being able to pay it anytime soon. He further
stated he intended to file bankruptcy no later than the summer of 2018 unless his finances
improved.
The SOR alleges one credit card debt with an outstanding balance of $26,019 that
was placed in collection status in March 2014. A credit report from April 2017 lists the
debt as in collection. Credit reports from September 2018 and April 2019 list the debt as
charged off. (Items 1, 4, 5, 6)
In  Appellant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  denied  the  allegation  and  stated  the
following: “While I had an outstanding balance with [creditor] for the amount noted, at the
time when I first applied for a clearance, I am now making payments on the balance and
intend to pay this off.” He did not provide documentary proof. (Item 1)
Applicant explained in his FORM response that he began experiencing financial
problems  in  2007  when  he  was  laid  off  after  twenty  years  of  employment  with  a  large
defense contractor. He was unemployed as follows: July 2007 to May 2008; October 2008
to  December 2010; August  2012  to  August 2013;  and  January  2014  to  October 2014.
During the interim periods Applicant was underemployed in part-time work or worked for
employers  as  he  was  needed.  At  different  times  his  only  source  of  income  was
unemployment  insurance.  In  2010,  he  chose  to  move  his  family  to  a  more  affordable
location. He placed their townhouse for sale, but it did not sell until September 2012. He
was forced to continue to pay the mortgage and rent on the apartment where his family
had moved. (AE A)
Applicant also attributed his financial problems to medical expenses in December
2016,  November  2017,  and  February  2018  for  his  wife  that  were  not  covered  by
insurance. He said that he is making payments on these debts. He also had medical bills
not covered by insurance that he had to pay. He did not provide what he paid, when he
paid them, and any remaining balance. (AE A)
Applicant stated in his FORM responses that he contacted the credit card company
in early 2019. He said he began repaying the debt in March 2019 and reduced the amount
owed to $24,770. Applicant failed to provide documentary proof that he has a payment
plan with the creditor or proof that he has reduced his debt. (AE A)
