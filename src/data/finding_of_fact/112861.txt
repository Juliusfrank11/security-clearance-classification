Financial
The  SOR  ¶¶1.a-1.m  alleged  failure  to  timely  file  state  and  Federal  income  tax
returns from  2012  through  2016;  delinquent federal  tax  debt  in the amount  of $50,343
for tax years 2012 through 2015; state delinquent tax debt in the amount of $60,896 for
tax  years  2010  through  2014;  five  judgments;  and  four  collection  accounts  for  an
approximate total of $50,000. Applicant admitted that his financial record looks bad, but
that does not reflect who he is as a person.
Applicant  explained  that  in  2007,  he  was  financially  stable,  and  had  a  good
income. His one daughter lived with her mother. He attributes the debts to purchasing
five  properties  between  the  years  of  2007  and  2008.  He  revealed  that  he  had  extra
money  and  wanted  to  explore  the  real  estate  market.  He  purchased  the  first  property
and  rented  the  home  until  2009.  (Tr.  41)  Applicant  purchased  a  second  property  and
had a tenant who paid the rent. Applicant purchased that house with his mother-in-law.
(Tr.  42)  He  also  purchased  a  property  in  2007  with  his  sister.  In  2008,  Applicant
purchased yet another house and was able to rent it. He explained that he had sufficient
income  from  the  rentals  to  pay  the  five  mortgages.  (Tr.  44)    Applicant  bought  another
house  at  an  auction  in  2008.  (AX  A)  He  purchased  the  last  property  with  his  wife  in
2008.  (Tr. 47)   The  total purchase  price for the five  properties  (2007-2008) was  about
$675,000. (Tr. 104) At that time, Applicant earned about $95,000 a year. (Tr. 105)
Applicant attributed the market crisis in 2010 and 2011 for his financial problems.
The tenants could not afford to buy the houses and the value of the properties declined.
He  also  explained  that  one  of  the  properties  in  another  state  was  rented  for  lower
income section 8 housing and tenants would put down a deposit and not pay the rent,
but  stay  in  the  house.  (Tr.  50)  When  houses  in  that  area  became  vacant,  there  was
vandalism. He tried to fix the houses but the agent-broker stated that they could not be
rented  or  listed.  Applicant  attempted  to  sell  the  houses  but  was  not  successful.  The
homes went to foreclosure. (Tr. 106) Applicant began using his credit cards to remodel
the various properties. Applicant had five mortgages to pay and no tenants paying rent.
He became overwhelmed. (Tr.52) He managed to sell one house at a loss and another
at cost. (Tr. 52)
At  the  same  time,  Applicant  explained  he  became  involved  in  a  2010  custody
dispute  involving  his  daughter  from  a  former  relationship.  (AX  B)  The  mother  of  the
daughter went to court to ask for more child support and he was ordered to pay about
$700  a  month.  The  child  support  increased  to  $963  in  year  2010-2011.  (Tr.  55)
Applicant became delinquent in the child support and he incurred large legal fees from
court  proceedings.  He  also  paid  $150  in  arrears,  which  made  for  a  total  monthly
payment  of  $1,000  in  year  2014.  This  amount  was  automatically  deducted  from  his
paycheck. (Tr. 56) Applicant completed his child support obligations in 2016. (Tr. 57, GX
4)
Applicant  further  explained  that  his  sister  with  whom  he  had  purchased  two
properties  had  a  stroke  in  2009.  She  lost  her  employment,  and  Applicant  was  now
responsible  for  the  entire  mortgage  on  the  properties.  Applicant  also  was  diagnosed
with diabetes and he incurred medical expenses. (Tr. 61)
Applicant  does  not  want  to  file  for  bankruptcy.  He  was  emphatic  that  he  is  not
irresponsible  and  did  not  live  beyond  his  means.  Until  about  2010,  he  was  financially
stable. He thought he was making good investments and did not want to give up. Also,
he  had  no  idea  that  the  market  would  fall  or  that  his  sister  would  have  a  stroke.  He
knows  he  made  mistakes  and  he  has  learned  from  them.  He  explained  that  he  would
not venture into the real estate market again. His plan was to resolve one financial issue
at a time. When the child support ended in 2016, he paid some non-SOR debts. (Tr. 63)
Applicant summed up by saying that another catastrophe occurred when his home roof
leaked  in  2011,  causing  him  to  lose  important  documents,  including  tax  materials.  He
stated that stopped him from preparing his taxes because he was overwhelmed and did
not have the information needed to prove his losses.  (Tr. 65)
As  to  SOR  1.a, and  1.b,  Applicant  admitted  that he  had not filed  Federal  (2012
through 2016) and state income tax returns (2013 through 2016) in a timely manner.  At
this  time,  Applicant  has  filed  all  his  income  tax  returns  according  to  tax  transcripts  in
2017  for  the  years  2012  through  2016.  (GX  4)    The  forms  were  completed  by  a  tax
professional.  When he filed the income tax returns, he included the 1099 forms for the
mortgage  deficiencies.  His  reason  for  the  delay  in  filing  was  that  he  was  totally
overwhelmed  with  his  financial  situation.  (Tr.  120)  In  2017,  Applicant  obtained  the
services of a community tax group to help him resolve remaining tax issues for tax year
2017.  (AX  D)   Applicant  still does  not have a  payment  plan  in  place  with  the  IRS.  (Tr.
125)  He  noted  that  he  has  not  been  happy  with  the  work  that  the  community  tax
program has partially completed on his behalf.

and 2015. The total taxes due is $50,343. Applicant began making payments of varying
amounts to the IRS beginning in 2018. (AX C) He also returned a refund from tax years
2016, 2017, and 2018. (Tr. 67) He believes that he has paid about $30,000 to the IRS.
(Tr.  81)  The  payments  are  not  consistent  due  to  lack  of  money.  Due  to  penalties  and
interest, he still owes about $60,000. (Tr. 128)

approximately $60,896 for tax years 2010 through 2014. He submitted a letter from the
state  comptroller,  dated  September  17,  2018,  indicating  that  Applicant  agreed  to
establish a payment plan. The agreement called for a down payment of $700 on May 8,
2018, and monthly payments of $450 until the balance is paid in full. (AX E) He did not
furnish any proof, but he stated that he has been making the monthly payments to  the
state. (Tr. 130)

been paid in full. (AX C)

on Applicant’s residence. (GX 6) He stated that he moved from the house in  2012. He
cannot find proof that it was paid even though his wife used a money order. He noted
that  his  wife  drove  to  the  lawyer’s  office  to  pay  it.  He  noted  that  the  house  has  been
sold. (Tr. 90)
As to SOR 1.i, this is a 2014 judgment in the amount of $4,661. Applicant is not
certain if he paid or settled this account. There appeared to be a similar account listed in
1.l for $1,021 held by the same bank. He believes he settled the debt in 1.l, but he could
not be certain.
As  to  SOR  1.j,  a  phone  collection  account  in  the  amount  of  $1,267,  Applicant
presented a statement that shows a payment of $418.22 that was made on November

Applicant earns approximately $107,000 yearly and his wife works part time as a
nurse.  She earns  about $18,000 a  year.  He  had a 401(k),  but  cashed  out a portion to
pay for some taxes. Applicant believes that he has about $7,000 in the account. He has
a small savings account. He believes that his monthly net remainder is about $100.  In
2018, he visited his family abroad. (Tr. 115) In 2019, he went again to visit a sick family
member.
Applicant’s  employer  testified  that  he  has  known  applicant  since  2003.  At  one
point in time, he was Applicant’s direct supervisor. The employer stated that Applicant is
an  outstanding  employee.  He  is  professional  and  produces  outstanding  results.
Applicant’s  employer  was  not  aware  of  the  breadth  of  the  current  financial  security
concerns.  (Tr.  15)  Applicant  is  considered  to  be  a  valuable  employee.  (Tr.  17)  His
employer interacts with Applicant on a daily basis. (Tr. 24)

She had difficulty speaking, but she confirmed that she co-signed with Applicant on the
purchase of two of the properties in 2008. (Tr. 142)
