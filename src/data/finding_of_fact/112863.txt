In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f,
1.h, and 2.a. He denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.i. Department Counsel withdrew SOR
¶  1.g.  Applicant’s  admissions  in  his  answer  and  at  the  hearing  are  incorporated  in  my
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor, involved in the test
and evaluation of training systems. He married in July 2006. He  and his wife have two
children, ages 12 and 3. He has worked for his current employer since March 2016. He
served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from September 2004 to May 2014 and received
an honorable discharge. He spent six years on sea duty as a tactical air controller and
four  years  as  a  tactical  air  control  instructor.  (Tr.  35.)  He  first  received  a  security
clearance in June 2004.
Applicant left the Navy to care for his elderly and disabled mother, who had lived
alone since Applicant’s father passed away in 2005. He intended to stay in the Navy but
was  unable  to  obtain  an  assignment  near  his  mother.  He  thought  he  had  a  job  with  a
defense contractor waiting for him after his discharge, but he was mistaken. He planned
to attend college, but did not realize that the GI Bill pays a housing allowance only for
the time actually spent in school.  He realized in hindsight that he had not planned well
for the financial challenges of leaving the Navy. (Tr. 35-36.)
Applicant’s  mother passed away  in October 2017. In December 2018, Applicant
was appointed the administrator of his mother’s estate. He had anticipated inheriting his
mother’s  investments  in  certificates  of  deposit  totaling  more  than  $100,000.  After  his
mother’s death, he discovered that his sister was the sole beneficiary for the certificates
of deposit. (Tr. 41; AX I.) However, he inherited his mother’s home, two other parcels of
land, and three vehicles. (Tr. 47.)
Applicant  was  unemployed  after  his  discharge  until  March  2015.  He  was bitten
by a kitten that he had adopted in early 2015. The bite wound became infected, and he
contracted Bell’s palsy (temporary facial paralysis), which lasted about eight weeks. His

otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
wife became pregnant in February 2015. Between March 2015 and obtaining his current
employment, he had no medical insurance.  He began classes at  a  community college,
but  dropped  out  during  his  second  semester  due  to  the  Ball’s  palsy.  He  incurred  an
indebtedness  to  the  Department  of  Veteran’s  Affairs  for  failing  to  complete  the
semester, which was collected by garnishment of his pay. (Tr. 43-44.)
Applicant  was  fired  from  two  jobs  for  customer-service  issues  in  vehicle  repair
shops  in  August  2015  and  January  2016.  He  was  unemployed  for  one  month  in  2016
and worked for one month in a tire store until he began his current job. In March 2017,
he  incurred  about  $6,000  in  veterinary  fees  when  the  family  dog  became  ill  and
eventually died. (GX 5 at 4.)
Applicant’s  unemployment,  underemployment,  and  unexpected  medical  and
veterinary  expenses  caused  him  to  fall  behind  on  his  debt  payments,  resulting  in  the
debts  alleged  in  the  SOR,  which  are  reflected  in  his  credit  reports  from  January  2018
(GX 2), February 2018 (GX 3), and  November 2018 (GX 4). The evidence concerning
these debts is summarized below.
SOR  ¶  1.a:  credit-card  account  charged  off  for  $13,511.  At  the  time  of  the
hearing, he believed that he had arrived at a settlement with the creditor, but he had no
documentation and did not know the specific terms of the settlement. (Tr. 46.) On April
10, 2019, about two weeks after the hearing, Applicant agreed in writing to pay this debt
in full by May 31, 2019. (AX R.)
SOR  ¶  1.b:  deficiency  of  $10,653  after  repossession  of  vehicle.  Applicant
bought a car about a week after he was hired by his current employer, and he incurred
a  high  interest  rate  because  of  his  poor  credit  record.  (Tr.  38.)  He  borrowed  about
$30,000  to  purchase  the  car.  (Tr.  47.)  He  testified  that  he  bought  an  expensive  car
because  he  had  a  long  commute  to  work,  and  he  wanted  a  car  that  was  comfortable
and enjoyable. He admitted that, in hindsight, it was a “really bad idea.” (Tr. 61-62.) He
surrendered  the  car  when  he  could  not  make  the  payments.  He  has  a  payment
agreement  for  this  debt,  and  he  made  a  $25  payment  in  November  2018  and  $100
payments in December 2018, January 2019, February 2019, and March 2019. (AX A.)
SOR  ¶  1.c:  credit-card  account  charged  off  for  $9,754.  Applicant  received  a
settlement  offer  for  this  debt  in  February  2018.  (AX  B.)  He  accepted  the  offer  in  April
2019 and agreed to pay a lump-sum of $1,950 by May 31, 2019. (AX Q.)
SOR  ¶  1.d:  delinquent  automobile  loan  charged  off  for  $7,943.  This  vehicle
has  not  been  repossessed,  and  Applicant  continues  to  drive  it.  (Tr.  50.)  In  December
2018, Applicant received an offer to settle this debt for $1,985. (AX C.) He accepted the
offer in April 2019 and agreed to pay the amount due by May 31, 2019. (AX S.)
SOR ¶  1.e: credit-card account placed for collection of $758. Applicant paid
this debt in February 2011. (AX D.)
SOR  ¶  1.f:  credit-card  account  placed  for  collection  of  $849.  Applicant  paid
this debt in February 2017. (AX T.)
SOR ¶ 1.g: withdrawn. (Tr. 66-67.)
SOR  ¶  1.h:  delinquent  federal  taxes  of  $3,000.  Applicant’s  2015  federal
income tax return was audited and he was notified by the IRS that he owed additional
taxes. He had not paid them as of the date of his interview with a security investigator in
June 2018. (GX 5  at 5.) The debt was paid by involuntary application of his tax refund
when he filed his federal income tax return for 2017.
SOR ¶ 1.i: failure to file federal income taxes returns for 2017. Applicant told
a security investigator that he failed to timely file his federal income tax return for 2017
due  to  procrastination  and  misplacing  documentation  regarding  mortgage  interest  on
the family home. He had not yet  filed the past-due return when he was interviewed by
the  security  investigator  in  June  2018.  (GX  5  at  5.)  He  filed  the  return  in  September
2018, and his $3,121 refund was applied to the tax debt from 2015. (AX E; AX F; AX G.)
Applicant  has  not  sought  or  received  financial  counseling  since  his  financial
problems  began.  (Tr. 57.)  His take-home  pay  is  about  $4,000  per  month.  (Tr.  58.)  His
wife’s take-home pay is about $1,600 per month. (Tr. 61.) He and his wife now live in
the  home  he  inherited  from  his  mother.  (Tr.  46-47.)  Because  the  inherited  home
requires numerous repairs, they have no net monthly remainder. (Tr. 64.)
Applicant’s monthly payment on his previous home is $1,600 per month, and the
balance due on the loan is about $212,000. He has listed his previous home for sale for
$274,990.  (AX  M.)  On  the  advice  of  his  realtor,  he  has  made  repairs  to  the  home
costing about $2,141, and his realtor is confident that it will  sell quickly. (AX N through
O.)  He  is  also  making  the  mortgage-loan  payments  on  his  mother’s  home,  where  he
now lives, which are $860 per month for the first mortgage and $400 on an equity line of
credit.  (Tr.  60.)  Applicant  is  counting  on  the  sale  of  his  previous  home  to  pay  off  the
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d. (Tr. 51.)
From  January  to  September,  2017,  Applicant  improperly  used  his  employer’s
credit  card  to  buy  fuel  for  his  car,  because  he  could  not  afford  to  buy  fuel  for  his
commute  to  and  from  work.  He  admitted  that  he  knew  the  terms  under  which  he  was
given a company credit card did not permit him to use it for personal expenses. (Tr. 56.)
He  testified  that  he  was  afraid  to  tell  anyone  in  the  company  that  he  was  having
financial issues. (Tr. 57.) His misuse of the credit card was discovered when he missed
a payment and the credit-card issuer reported the late payment to his employer. (GX 5
at  4.)  His  program  manager  reprimanded  him  for  misuse  of  the  credit  card.  Applicant
signed an agreement that he would be terminated if he misused a company credit card
again. (Tr. 56.)
The  same  program  manager  who  reprimanded  Applicant  submitted  a  letter
stating that his work has been superior, and he recommended that Applicant be given
another  chance.  (AX  J.)  Applicant’s  facility  security  manager  also  noted  Applicant’s
changed behavior and his “unyielding attempt to rebuild trust with the organization.” (AX
K.)
The  team  lead  for  the  contract  on  which  Applicant  is  working  testified  that
Applicant’s Navy experience has made him the “go-to guy” on their current contract. (Tr.
24-25.) A co-worker has known Applicant for two years, and they have become friends.
The co-worker testified that Applicant has truthfully disclosed his financial problems and
has  demonstrated  that  he  is  trustworthy.  (Tr.  29-30.)  Both  witnesses  knew  that
Applicant has financial problems but were not familiar with the details. (Tr. 26, 31.)
