Applicant  admitted,  with  explanations,  all  six  allegations  in  the  SOR.  I  have
incorporated his admissions into the findings of fact. Applicant’s personal information is
extracted  from  GE  1,  his  security  clearance  application,  dated  July  24,  2017,  unless
otherwise  indicated  by  a  parenthetical  citation  to  the  record.  After  a  thorough  and
complete review of the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 41 years old and has worked as a supervisor for a defense contractor
since June 2017. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps for 21 years and was honorably
discharged in 2017 with the rank of gunnery sergeant (E-7). Applicant has held a security
clearance since 1995, which was renewed in 2007.  He has been married for 20 years
and  has  three  children  and  a  stepchild.  In  2009,  he  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in
information-technology management. (Tr. 11-12.)
On July 24, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) in
connection with his new employment with a defense contractor. He disclosed in his SCA
that in 2013, while he was assigned to duties in Japan and his wife was unable to work,
they sought financial guidance from a legitimate, professional counseling company (the
Counselor) to help them budget their expenses and to pay off their debts in an orderly
manner.  They  set  up a  three-plus  year  payment  plan,  which  he  reported  would end  in
October 2017. The plan provided for the resolution of about 12 debts that totaled about
$13,000.  He  actually  made  the  last  payment  in  April  or  May  of  2018.  In  April  2017,
Applicant also hired a credit repair firm to help him remove debts from his credit report
that were lingering after the debts were resolved. (GE 1 at 37-38; Tr. 36, 40, 45, and 48-
49; AE K.)
The SOR alleges a 2005 Chapter 7 bankruptcy (SOR  ¶ 1.a) and five delinquent
debts,  consisting  of  a  $30,000  debt  owed  to  a  solar  energy  company  (SOR  ¶  1.e),  a
charged-off personal loan in the amount of $2,809 (SOR ¶ 1.b, ), a balance due on a car
loan in the amount of $812 (SOR ¶ 1.c), a credit-card debt in the amount of $143 (SOR ¶
1.d),  and  a  bill  related  to  the  adoption  of  a  dog  in  the  amount  of  $67  (SOR  ¶  1.f).
Applicant’s most significant delinquent debts arose in 2014 when his posting in Japan,
caused him some significant financial distress.
In  January  2013,  Applicant  received  accompanied-overseas  orders  for  a
permanent station change to Japan. Prior to his transfer in May 2013, Applicant and his
family lived in a home that he owned in the United States. After his relocation, he rented
the house for a period, but lost the tenant in late 2013. From his duty station in Japan, he
was unable to find a reliable tenant. He was forced to pay $2,100 per month without the
benefit of his basic housing allowance since he and his family lived on base in Japan. He
incurred a number of debts and hired the Counselor to help resolve them. The two largest
SOR debts discussed below (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.e) arose during this period and could not
be resolved by ICDS’s debt consolidation process. In October 2015, he managed to sell
his U.S. home in a short sale that resolved his mortgage delinquency, and to pay off most
of his debts with the help of the Counselor. The five SOR debts are the exceptions. (Tr.
21-25, 46; SOR Response at 1; AE B; GE 2 at 6.)
Applicant’s  financial  condition  worsened  in  May  2015  when  his  daughter  was
diagnosed  with  a  serious,  long-term  illness  that  required  that  she  return  to  the  United
States  for  treatment.  She  was  hospitalized  for  four  months.  His  wife  and  daughter
immediately  moved  to  Hawaii,  and  Applicant  followed  later  after  receiving  a  hardship
transfer. The sudden relocation as well as his daughter’s medical care caused significant
family expenses and further aggravated his financial distress. (Tr. 31-33, 46.)
SOR ¶ 1.a: 2005 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Applicant was confronted with financial
difficulties during a ten-month deployment in a war zone in 2004 to early 2005. He sought
financial assistance to prepare a family budget at the beginning of his deployment, which
worked  well  until  December  2004,  when  his  wife  become  seriously  ill  and  was
incapacitated. Their children were put in day care, which was expensive, and his wife got
behind in their bills. He sought financial assistance from a debt-consolidation company
that recommended that he file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He did so, and his debts, which
totaled $39,410, were discharged in May 2005. He kept his two cars out of the bankruptcy
and continued making payments on them. (SOR Response at 1 and 9; GE 3 at 3; Tr. 17-
20 and 42.)
SOR ¶ 1.e: Financing debt for solar energy panels charged off in the amount
of $30,338. Applicant opened this account in October 2011 in the approximate amount of
$26,000 to  pay  for the  installation of  solar-energy  panels on  the  roof  of  his house.  He
defaulted on this account in or about August 2014, at a time when he was prioritizing the
payment of the mortgage on the property. The creditor refused to work out a payment
arrangement with the Counselor, which Applicant had engaged in August 2014 to help
him. The creditor repossessed the solar panels and charged off the entire account. In an
email from the creditor, dated November 21, 2018, three years after the repossession of
the equipment, Applicant was advised that the creditor retained the solar system in full
satisfaction for the amount owed under his contract and reported a zero balance on the
account. This debt was dropped from the Government’s credit report, dated September
17, 2018. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 29-32, 51-53; AE C, E; GE 5.)
SOR ¶ 1.b: loan account charged off in the amount of $2,809. In December
2012, Applicant took out this personal loan in the approximate amount of $3,800 to pay
for household goods and expenses. He defaulted on the loan in or about September 2014
when  he  was  stationed  overseas  and  his  daughter  became  ill.  In  November  2018,  he
entered into a settlement and payment plan with the creditor under which they reduced
the debt to $1,824 and agreed to accept payments of $180 for a ten-month period, ending
in August 2019. This debt is being resolved. (Tr. 20-24, 42-43; AE I and Q.)
SOR  ¶  1.c:  car-loan  account  referred  to  collection  in  the  amount  $812.
Applicant purchased a car in November 2010 and was obligated to pay $546 a month for
five years. He traded the car in when he purchased his current car. He believed that the
car dealership that took his old car as a trade was responsible for paying off the balance
of the loan so that the dealership could obtain a clean title to the car. In September 2016,
he received a letter from the creditor claiming he owed this additional amount. He tried to
work with dealership that sold him the original car and the dealership that accepted that
car as a trade for his new car, but neither would accept responsibility. To clear the debt
off his credit report, he paid it in August 2018, which was prior to the issuance of the SOR.
He attached to his SOR Response a letter from the creditor, dated August 29, 2018, which
advised Applicant that his account has been paid in full and closed. This debt has been
resolved. (Tr. 24-26; SOR Response at 10; GE 4.)
SOR  ¶  1.d:  delinquent  credit  card  account  debt  in  the  amount  of  $143.
Applicant opened this credit card account in August 2011. He defaulted on paying  this
account  in  2014.  He  made  payments  on  the  original  debt  of  about  $640  through  the
Counselor.  He understood  the  debt  was fully  paid,  but he  was  told  by  the  background
investigator  that  he  still  owed  the  bank  a  small  amount  and  that  the  debt  had  been
charged off. He then contacted the bank and the collection agency that owned the debt.
The  collection  agency  offered  a  settlement  of  $104,  and  Applicant  paid  it.  Applicant
submitted an exhibit which reflects that this account has a $0 balance. This debt has been
resolved. (Tr. 26-29; AE P.)
SOR ¶ 1.f: account referred to collection in the amount of $67. This debt was
incurred when he and his family adopted a dog in 2012. He thought he paid this charge
at the time of the adoption and believes the debt is a mistake. He learned about the debt
at the time of his background interview. It had not appeared on the credit reports he had
previously reviewed. On November 20, 2018, he paid the collection agency to have the
debt removed from his credit report. This debt has been resolved. (Tr. 34-36; AE H.)
Applicant submitted three reference letters, two from fellow members of the Marine
Corps  and  one  from  a  co-worker.  They  all  describe  Applicant  as  a  highly  trusted,
professional,  and  dedicated  Marine,  now  retired.  One  reference  commented  that
Applicant  always  took  responsibility  for  his  mistakes.  He  did  exactly  that  during  his
background interview and during his testimony at the hearing. His co-worker wrote that
Applicant has excellent judgment and is highly trustworthy. (AE A.)
Applicant  has  been  awarded  six  Navy  Achievement  Medals  and  three  Navy
Commendation  Medals.  He  has  been  assigned  to  eight  overseas  tours  away  from  his
family,  three  of  which  were  combat  tours  in  war  zones.  He  provided  copies  of  these
awards along with copies of many others he has received from the Navy over his 20 years
of  service.  He  also  provided  a  detailed  budget  that  shows  a  net  monthly  remainder  of
$3,325.  He  follows  the  budget  carefully  and  pays  all  of  his  expenses.  He  has  no  new
debts at this time (AE L and N; Tr. 37.)
