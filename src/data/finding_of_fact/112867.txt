Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct
Applicant’s  SOR  alleges  32  delinquent debts  totaling  $92,948. Their  status  is  as
follows:
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  a  charged-off  debt  for  $18,937.  Applicant  purchased  a  used
vehicle, and she learned that she was unable to afford the payments. (Tr. 29) The vehicle
was  voluntarily  repossessed.  (Tr. 29, 37) She  started  a  payment plan  after the  creditor
sold the vehicle; however, due to her unemployment, she was unable to continue making
the payments. (Tr. 30) On March  9, 2019, the creditor acknowledged receipt of a $100
payment. (Tr. 34-35; AE G) The creditor indicated there should be a payment agreement
established enabling  the  creditor to  withdraw  $100 monthly  from Applicant’s  account  to
address the debt; however, she did not establish the automatic debit from her account.
(Tr. 38; AE G) The current balance owed according to the creditor was $8,776. (Tr. 32-33;
AE G; AE Y3) She made a $100 payment in August 2019, and then she stopped making
payments. (Tr. 33-35; AE Y2) She asked her consolidated debt payment plan (CDPP) to
add this debt to her plan. (Tr. 33; AE Z)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  a  charged-off  debt  for  $9,143.  Applicant  accepted  overseas
employment; she did not have time to sell the vehicle; and she surrendered the vehicle to
the  creditor  holding  a  lien  on  her  vehicle  resulting  in  this  debt.  (Tr.  39,  42)  She  was
transferred overseas in December 2016. (Tr. 44; AE U) She paid $147 in April 2019. (Tr.
44; AE H) She said she maintained “constant” communication with the creditor about the
debt.  (Tr.  41)  At  her  hearing,  she  estimated  the  balance  owed  on  the  debt  was  about
$2,700.  (Tr.  43)  In  August  2019,  she  paid  $100.  (AE  Z2)  In  October  2019,  the  creditor
agreed to settle the debt for $800, and Applicant paid $800 that same month resolving the
debt. (AE Z2-AE Z4)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges a  debt  placed for collections  for $1,363. When Applicant  was
transferred  overseas  in  December  2016,  there  was  confusion  over  the  status  of  her
account.  (Tr.  45-50;  AE  U) When  she  discovered  the  creditor sought  more money,  she
was unemployed and unable to resolve the debt. (Tr. 46) Applicant paid the creditor a total
of $1,090, and she made the final payment of $545 on April 19, 2019, resolving the debt.
(Tr. 46-48; AE I; AE BB2)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges a debt placed collection for $5,841. Applicant left an apartment
and moved to a different state. (Tr. 50) She acknowledged that she broke her lease. (Tr.
52) In June 2011, her landlord wrote that Applicant “is a current resident in good standing
at this property. She moved in on 26 August 2009 and has given notice to move out in July
2011.”  (AE  J)  The  creditor’s  letter  did  not  mention  any  charges  to  be  imposed  at  the
termination of the lease. (AE J) The creditor sent information about the delinquent debt to
credit  reporting  companies  in  September  2011.  (Tr.  53;  GE  2)  Applicant  disputed  her
responsibility for this debt, and she filed disputes with the credit reporting companies in
2018. (Tr. 50-54) She contacted the creditor; however, Applicant believed the creditor was
unable to provide information about  the debt most likely due to frequent turnover in the
rental office. (Tr. 53) The debt was removed from all of her current credit reports except
one. (Tr. 51, 54)
The SOR alleges 19 medical or dental debts placed for collection totaling $20,156
and listed in the following paragraphs: 1.e; 1.f; 1.g; 1.i; 1.j; 1.k; 1.l; 1.n; 1.o; 1.q; 1.s; 1.t;
1.u; 1.v; 1.w; 1.x; 1.aa; 1.dd; and 1.ee; for the following amounts: $3,647; $3,288; $2,807;
$2,031; $1,638; $1,246; $1,059; $792; $559; $518; $394; $382; $382; $382; $366; $322;
$172; $115; and $56.
Applicant said the SOR and her credit report erroneously list the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e
for $3,647 as a medical debt, and it is actually a debt for employer-sponsored training. (Tr.
55-56)  Her  April  2019  credit  report  shows  a  $3,769  debt  originating  in  2015  from  the
creditor listed in SOR ¶ 1.e actually resulted from a computer-training course. (AE K2) She
said  she  disputed  her  responsibility  for  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.e.  (Tr.  55-57;  AE  K)  She
showed that she requested that her employer pay the debt in 2014. (AE AA1; AE AA 2)
She  received  the  training.  (Tr.  55-59) She  believed  her employer  was  paying  the  debt;
however, she did not provide proof of employer payments. (Tr. 57-58) She said that she
elected to include the debt in her CDPP; however, it is not listed on her original CDPP plan
or on her amended October 2019 plan. (Tr. 61-62; AE L; AE EE1)
SOR ¶¶ 1.q, 1.t, 1.u, 1.v, and 1.ee allege five medical debts for $518, $382, $382,
$382, and $56, which are being collected by the same collection agent. Applicant disputed
these five debts because the creditor would not describe the treatment she received, and
in any event, even if the debts were valid, she believed they may be duplicates of other
medical debts. (Tr. 81-83, 85-86) TransUnion wrote Applicant and indicated the accounts
under collection by the creditor in SOR ¶¶ 1.q, 1.t, 1.u, 1.v, and 1.ee were deleted from
her credit report. (AE O) However, she did not provide Equifax or Experian credit reports.
When  Applicant  was  out  of  work,  she  did  not  have  medical  insurance,  and  she
accrued medical bills. (Tr. 62, 73) She accumulated delinquent medical bills in 2011, 2012,
and 2016. (Tr. 73) She made some payments to address her medical debts when she was
employed. (Tr. 62, 74-76; AE Y; AE Z) She paid off several of her medical debts. (Tr. 66-
67) She decided to employ CDPP to pay her medical debts. (Tr. 62)  On April 17, 2019,
she enrolled in CDPP to address 12 medical or dental SOR debts as well as the debt in
SOR ¶ 1.z for $315, and the non-medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f for $3,288 and 1.h for $2,920.
(Tr. 64; AE L; AE Z; AE EE1) Her payments to CDPP of $436 were scheduled to begin on
May 15, 2019. From May to August 2019, she paid CDPP $2,169 for an average of $434
per  month  for  those  five  months.  (AE  X1-X5;  AE  EE2-EE6)  She  said  she  was  making
payments to CDPP twice a month. (Tr. 70, 76) The documentation she submitted did not
show  consistent  bimonthly  payments  to  CDPP.  In  June  2019,  she  made  one  $112
payment;  in  July  2019,  she  did  not make any  payments;  and  in  August  2019,  she paid
$1,238 bringing her CDPP account current as of August 2019. (AE EE1-EE6) On June 27,
2019, CDPP emailed Applicant and informed her that two medical debts and the debt in
SOR ¶ 1.z were paid. (AE V) On October 22, 2019, she changed her monthly “auto pay”
payment to $358. (AE EE1 at 2) She did not provide documentation showing payments in
September and October 2019.
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges a debt placed for collection owed to a dating service for $2,573.
Applicant  believed  the  services  provided  were  not  equal  to  those  promised,  and  she
disputed her responsibility for the debt. (Tr. 72) Ultimately, she accepted responsibility for
the debt, and she placed the debt on her list for CDPP resolution. (Tr. 70-71; AE L; AE
EE1)
SOR ¶ 1.m alleges a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $853. On
March 22, 2019, Applicant paid the creditor $598, and the creditor said the debt is “settled
in full.” (Tr. 79-80; AE M)
SOR ¶ 1.p alleges a vehicle insurance debt placed for collection for $533. On April
2, 2019, the creditor wrote that the balance owed was zero, and the debt was settled in
full. (Tr. 80; AE N)
SOR ¶ 1.r alleges a utility debt placed for collection for $463. Applicant disputed
her  responsibility  for  this  debt.  (Tr.  84)  She  said  she  called  the  creditor;  however,  the
creditor was unable to find any information on her account. (Tr. 84) She disputed the debt,
and TransUnion wrote the debt was deleted from the TransUnion credit report. (AE O) She
conceded the debt remained on one of her other credit reports. (Tr. 84-85)
SOR ¶¶ 1.y and 1.z allege two payday-loan debts placed for collection by the same
collection agency for $315 and $315. On May 28, 2019, Applicant paid the debt in SOR ¶
1.y for $315. (Tr. 87-89; AE O; AE W; AE DD) In June 2019, CDPP informed Applicant
that the debt in SOR ¶ 1.z was paid. (AE V)
SOR ¶ 1.bb alleges a utility debt placed for collection for $151. On April 2, 2019,
Applicant paid this debt. (Tr. 89-90; AE P)
SOR ¶ 1.cc alleges a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $128. On
April 2, 2019, Applicant paid this debt. (Tr. 90; AE Q)
Applicant  received  financial  counseling.  (Tr.  33-34;  AE  T)  Applicant’s  February
2019 budget indicates the following monthly amounts: gross income of $8,643; net income
of $7,911; expenses and liabilities of $4,541 (rent is shown as $1,350 and $1,530); and
remainder  of  $6,571.  (AE  S)  Usually  the  remainder  is  calculated  by  subtracting  the
expenses  and  liabilities  from  the  net  income,  and  using  this  calculation,  the  remainder
would be $3,370.
Corporate Credit Card
SOR ¶ 1.ff alleges Applicant improperly charged $32,177 to a corporate credit card,
and  her  employer  terminated  her  employment  in  September  2017.  SOR  ¶  2.a  cross-
alleges the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.ff as a personal conduct security concern.
In  about  November  2016, Applicant accepted  a position  in  Europe.  (Tr. 91,  112-
113) Her employer asked her to spend two weeks in Southwest Asia doing audits or audit
training. (Tr. 91, 114) She stayed in Southwest Asia from about December 2016 to March
or April 2017, a period of about three months. (Tr. 114-115, 120) She traveled from Europe
to  Southwest  Asia  twice.  (Tr.  120)  She  was  employed  when  she  was  in  Europe  and
Southwest Asia. (Tr. 114) She stayed in a hotel for her first few days in Southwest Asia,
and her hotel expenses were properly charged on her corporate credit card. (Tr. 115, 119)
Most of the time she was in Southwest Asia, she stayed in an apartment, and her rent was
not charged on her corporate credit card because her employer paid for her apartment.
(Tr.  114-115)  There  was  a  per  diem  amount  that  limited  the  amount  she  would  be
reimbursed for meals. (Tr. 117)
Applicant understood that she would be submitting a reconciliation of her expenses
after she returned to Europe. (Tr. 117) She purchased airline tickets and paid for a rental
car with her corporate card. (Tr. 118, 121, 130) She received oral authorization to charge
the rental car on her corporate credit card. (Tr. 130-131) After she returned to Europe, she
submitted her expense reports related to her time in Europe and Southwest Asia. (Tr. 121-
122) She was in Europe until October 2018. (Tr. 121) Her employer disputed her charge
for  flying  business  class  on  one  occasion;  however,  she  believed  it  was  authorized
because of the circumstances in a country where she waited for a connecting flight. (Tr.
122, 132-133) She purchased clothing using her corporate credit card, such as a jacket;
however,  she  believed  this  expense  was  authorized.  (Tr.  122)  She  also  purchased  a
printer  for  her  computer  using  her  corporate  credit  card.  (Tr.  130)  She  was  unable  to
provide information about most of her purchases on her corporate credit card.
Applicant provided some emails to and from her employer to clarify and corroborate
her  statement  about  her  use  of  the  corporate  credit  card.  On  November  30,  2016,  she
emailed her supervisor:
I  went  over  my  finances  last  night  and  I  have  already  spent  quite  a  bit
preparing for this trip. So I know my corporate card may not be ready but
paying [for] a few nights in a hotel may not be ideal if the company is not
taking care of it. Just want to be upfront so there will be no issues.
Applicant’s supervisor responded in an email as follows:
Understood, we will cover the expenses, just won’t pay out immediately if
you  have  to  expense  it,  hence  my  concern.  I  am  working  an  angle  on
accommodations, might be  able  to directly  cover it,  so  you  won’t have  to
expense it. I am requesting a corporate card for you, but not sure yet when
you might get your hands on it. Shooting to get this [resolved] by the end of
the week.
On October 6, 2017, Applicant emailed her supervisor and one other person:
I  am  currently  planning  how  I  will  pay  for  the  next  couple  months  [of]
payments before I start a new position. I would like to know if the company
will be denying unemployment benefits. So I know if this is an option as a
source for repayment or not. Thank you ma’am.
(AE R)
On November 28, 2017, Applicant reported the following information in her SCA:
I did use the corporate credit card for personal use and work related use. I
was told that if we used it for personal use to pay it off right away. I also
used  it  for  work  transportation  and  lodging,  flight  to  [Europe]  from
[Southwest Asia] when I first moved, etc. . . . I tried to expense report much
of it since the company was to pay for a lot of it and they rejected it. I was
then  asked  [to]  pay  it  all  back  in  one  lump  sum.  I  could  not  so  I  was
terminated. I came up with a payment plan and showed where they did not
take  care  of  things  they  said  they  would  initially.  We  agreed  upon  the
termination and repayment of the card though they are not responding for
next payment. I have informed them of my recent job acceptance and my
good faith in paying my debt.
(GE 1 at 19) Applicant’s SCA states, “Provide the amount (in U.S. dollars) of violation:”
and  Applicant  responded,  “$25,000  (Estimated).”  (GE  1  at  61)  She  provided  an
explanation about what she was doing to take corrective action as follows:
I  have  started  paying  the  card  back  and  have  an  arrangement  with  the
company to pay back monthly and again when I start working again. I paid
a good faith payment before I left Italy [in] September [2017]. I have since
tried  to  contact  the  POC  and  Human  Resources  to  let  them  know  I  had
secured a new job and how [I] would like to know a better way to send a
payment since I would be Afghanistan because I really want to pay my debt.
I have received no answer from the POC or human resources. I have email
to show this.
(GE 1 at 61) She provided no emails from her former employer agreeing to a monthly
payment plan. She provided no emails to her former employer explaining she was now
employed, and she did not provide any evidence of any payments after  her October 6,
2017 email to her former employer.
On December 12, 2017, Applicant emailed her employer, “This is my third email to
get in contact with you about paying my debt back. Can you please respond? Thank you.”
On December 13, 2017, a representative of her employer emailed Applicant, “Just send
us  a  check  for  the  full  outstanding  amount.  Please  respond.”  (Tr.  103-104;  AE  R)
Applicant  did  not  provide  her  response,  if  any,  to  her  former  employer’s  email  of
December 13, 2017.
Applicant  provided  additional  information  about  her  stay  in  Southwest  Asia  from
about December 2016 to April 2017. Applicant was supposed to work at a DOD facility in
Southwest Asia. (Tr. 92) When she arrived in Southwest Asia, she “didn’t have a job. [She]
basically sat there.” (Tr. 92) She received a corporate credit card, and her supervisor orally
said she could use it for reasonable expenses. (Tr. 92, 126; AE R) She understood that
she could pay it back once she started to work again after she returned to Europe. (Tr. 92)
After she returned to Europe, her employer audited her credit card, and told her she was
only authorized to use the credit card for official business. (Tr. 92) Her employer asked her
to pay the charges on her card. (Tr. 93) She made one $2,000 payment with a cashier’s
check  shortly  after  she  returned  to  Europe  from  Southwest  Asia;  however,  she  did  not
receive a receipt showing this payment. (Tr. 101, 107, 124) At her hearing, she said 90
percent of the charges on her corporate credit card were for business purposes, and the
remainder were for personal expenses. (Tr. 94, 96-97) However, in her SOR response,
her attorney wrote that she “estimates that about $10,000 of the balance was for personal
use.”  (SOR  response)  She  did  not  use  the  corporate  credit  card  for  blatantly  improper
purchases such as gambling or purchase of illegal drugs. (Tr. 98) Applicant had a personal
credit card in Southwest Asia; however, it had a maximum limit of $250. (Tr. 110)
Applicant’s supervisor told her to make sure she paid back their employer. (Tr. 127)
He  said,  “Pay  them  off  as  soon  as  possible.”  (Tr.  127)  She  understood  that  she  could
charge personal expenses; however, she had to repay those charges later. (Tr. 134-135)
She  acknowledged  that  she  did  not  reimburse  her  employer  for  all  of  her  personal
expenses. (Tr. 128) She said she believed she did not retain copies of her expense reports.
(Tr. 128-129) Her employer never filed a lawsuit to collect the funds from Applicant. (Tr.
137)
Applicant  said  her  employer  was  able  to  review  her  charges  on  her  card  on  the
Internet;  however,  she  was  unable  to  see  the  charges  because  she  was  no  longer
employed  by  the  company.  (Tr.  94-95)  Applicant  indicated  the  amount  of  the  debt  as
$32,177  related  to  an  amount  on  a  promissory  note.  (Tr.  106-107)  Applicant  did  not
provide: a copy of the promissory note; the documentation supporting the amount owed;
and/or  a  copy  of  her  employer’s  rules,  policies,  or  regulations  regarding  appropriate
charges on her employer’s corporate credit card.
Applicant’s counsel said he wanted to submit a post-hearing-generated letter to the
creditor asking for a copy of the bank statements pertaining to the corporate credit card
that  would  show  which  charges  were  personal  and  which  charges  were  corporate.  (Tr.
101, 105, 108-109) The letter to the creditor was supposed to be submitted as an exhibit
after the hearing. (Tr. 108-109, 140-142) I did not receive the letter to the creditor. (HE 7)
