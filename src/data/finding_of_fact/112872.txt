The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of October 19, 2018, Applicant was
$129 past due on a student loan with a $2,184 balance (SOR ¶ 1.a); that he was $71 past
due on a student loan with a $1,212 balance (SOR ¶ 1,b); that he owed a charged-off
student loan of $50,607 (SOR ¶ 1.c); that he owed student loans of $2,357 (SOR ¶ 1.d)
and $1,308 (SOR ¶ 1.e) in collection; and that he owed an unpaid credit-card judgment
debt of $1,304 from January 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.f). When he responded to the SOR allegations
on November 14, 2018, Applicant denied that he was delinquent on his student loans. He
indicated that he was current on the loans in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b; that he had “set up a
way to pay off” the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c; and that he had paid off the loans in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and
1.e. He admitted the credit-card judgment in SOR ¶ 1.f, but stated that he might have paid
it off. It was not listed on his credit report.
After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 33 years old and not married. He attended a community college for one
year in 2004 or 2005. From approximately August 2007 to July 2008, he attended a for-
profit university.1 He obtained two private student loans of $47,828 and $25,479 from the
lender in SOR ¶ 1.c,2 and four federal student loans, including Stafford loans for $2,315
(SOR ¶ 1.a) and $1,185 (SOR ¶ 1.b).3 (GEs 3-4; AE A.) Applicant’s father co-signed the
1 Applicant indicated on his security clearance application that he attended the university from July 2006 to July
2007. (GE 1.) Based on the dates of his student loans, he likely attended the school from July or August 2007
to July 2008.
2 Only the larger of the two private student loans from the lender in SOR ¶ 1.c (ending in x8635) was alleged in
the SOR. The other student loan, ending in x8643, does not appear on his credit reports. Applicant admitted
that he obtained two large student loans from the lender. (Tr. 42.)
3 Applicant indicated that he had four Stafford student loans (three subsidized and one unsubsidized). (Tr. 24.)
He presented documentation of three Stafford student loans under the same account ending in #4034. His
loan documentation shows a “1-01 Stafford-Subsidized” student loan for $2,315 in August 2007 with a balance
of $2,188 (SOR ¶ 1.a); a “1-04 Stafford-Subsidized” loan of $2,315 obtained in August 2007 paid by the
creditor in SOR ¶ 1.d in September 2011; and a “1-03 Stafford-Unsubsidized” loan obtained in August 2007 for
$1,185 that was paid by the lender in SOR ¶ 1.e in September 2011. (AE B.) Department Counsel indicated at
Applicant’s hearing that the federal loans in SOR ¶ 1.a and ¶ 1.b are respectively duplicated in SOR ¶ 1.d and
loans. Applicant struggled academically, and he withdrew from the college after one year.
(GE 2.)
Applicant  moved  home  and  was  unemployed  until  April  2009,  when  he  began
working in a temporary job for a marine supply company. On October 15, 2009, a judgment
of $2,090 (judgment #1, not alleged) was entered against Applicant for credit-card debt he
incurred while in college. Applicant had forgotten about the account after he moved. In
April 2010, he was hired into a permanent position as a warehouse technician. (GEs 1-2.)
With his father’s assistance, Applicant began repaying his student loans. In January 2011,
he moved into an apartment. (GE 2.)
Applicant’s father became ill in early 2011 and passed away in July 2011.  (GE 2; Tr.
39.) Applicant could not afford his student-loan payments on his own. In September 2011,
the creditor identified in SOR ¶ 1.c charged off one of his private loans for $50,607 and
transferred  two  Stafford  loans  to  the  guarantor  identified  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.e  with
balances of $2,616 and $1,452. (GEs 2-4; AE B.)
Applicant  moved  back  home  to  help  his  mother  in  January  2012.  (Tr.  39.)  His
employment  income  was approximately $400 a week. (GE 2.) In late January 2012, a
default judgment for $1,304 (judgment #2, SOR ¶ 1.f) was entered against Applicant for
credit-card debt incurred in college. (GE 5; Tr. 20.)
In August 2013, Applicant began a new job as a technician for a chemical company.
He earned approximately $500 a week, and he made some payments on his student loans
in 2015. Applicant had some difficulties with his managers, and he was terminated in May
2016 for the stated reason that he was not a good fit for the job. The company eventually
agreed to pay him a settlement of $3,500, for violating his human rights in return for him
not disclosing the settlement terms.4 (GE 2; Tr. 73.) A production manager provided an
employment reference for Applicant in his search for a new job. (Tr. 38.) He attested that
Applicant  always  took  care  to  complete  his  work  assignments  quickly  and  accurately.
Applicant had a positive attitude and worked well with his co-workers. He was a reliable
resource in the production department. (AE G.)
from
Applicant  collected  unemployment  compensation  of  $350  a  week
approximately May 2016 to March 2017. He attended an advanced manufacturing sheet-
metal program at a community college from July 2016 to December 2016 and otherwise
1.e as they have the same account numbers. The creditor in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e was the guarantor for the
Stafford loans, which are all listed under the same account number by the lender. (AE B.) Applicant testified
that two of the Stafford loans were listed as paid only because they were passed on to the guarantor. (Tr. 25.)
He now thinks that the loans in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e are back with the lender and are the loans in SOR ¶¶ 1.a
and 1.b. (Tr. 55.) Applicant’s May 2018 credit report does not list the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e (GE 4), so
they may be the loans in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, or they may be the federal loans paid through garnishment in
2017, as detailed in GE 2. The evidence falls short of substantiating that he owes the additional debt balances
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e.
4 Applicant testified that he was paid the settlement in January 2016. (Tr. 73.) However, according to his SF
86, he was terminated in May 2016 (GE 1), so it is likely that he received the settlement in January 2017.
spent his time looking for work, helping out at home, and engaging in recreational activities.
(GE 2; AE E.) After he finished the first semester of the program at the community college,
he received a job offer from a defense contractor to become a semi-skilled sheet metal
mechanic in its apprenticeship program. (Tr. 32. 70.)
With his application for that employment, Applicant completed and certified to the
accuracy  of  a  Questionnaire  for National Security  Positions  (SF 86) on  December 23,
2016. Applicant responded affirmatively to an inquiry concerning whether he was currently
delinquent  on  any  federal  debt  and  disclosed  that  he  owed  student-loan  debts  of
approximately $80,000. (GE 1.)
Applicant was granted an interim secret clearance in mid-March 2017, and he began
working for the defense contractor in late March 2017. (GE 2; Tr. 33, 35-37.) Available
credit information revealed that Applicant was in default on the private student loan in SOR
¶  1.c  with  an  accrued  balance  of  $69,260.  The  federal  student  loans  acquired  by  the
guarantor in September 2011 were in collection for $2,357 (SOR ¶ 1.d) and $1,308 (SOR ¶
1.e). Applicant had a credit card account with a $2,341 balance ($41 over its reported
credit limit) that he was repaying according to its terms. Neither judgment debt #1 nor
judgment debt #2 was on his credit record. (GE 3.)
In May 2017, the creditor executed a wage garnishment order to collect judgment
debt #1. Applicant’s wages were garnished at $135 every paycheck from June 2017 to
October 2017 to satisfy the debt. In June 2017, the U.S. Department of Education obtained
a  garnishment  order  to  collect  $3,822  in  defaulted  federal  student-loan  debt,  which
Applicant indicated in April 2018 were the loans in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e. (GE 2.)
As  of  June  2017,  Applicant  owed  $119,719  on  his  two  private  student  loans,
including the loan in SOR ¶ 1.c. A collection entity offered to settle both loans for only
$14,661.  Applicant  could  not  afford  the  lump-sum  payment,  and  the  loan  balances
continued to accrue. (Tr. 44.) In September 2017, the collection entity offered to settle his
then $120,969 total balance for $13,195. Applicant could not afford that payment. (GE 6.)
On April 5, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  He  indicated  that  his  student  loans  were  no
longer  delinquent,  but  that  he  had  yet  to  establish  a  repayment  plan  to  avoid  further
delinquency. He stated that his wages were being garnished at $100 a paycheck to repay
two of his federal student loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e). He indicated that he had paid $5 a
month from March 2017 to November 2017 to rehabilitate a student loan. He could not
then recall which one, although at his hearing he testified that he had rehabilitated the
loans in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e, which were returned to the lender as shown in SOR ¶¶ 1.a
and 1.b. (Tr. 55.) As for his financial matters generally, Applicant’s take-home income was
$460 per week after the garnishment for his student loans. His monthly expenses were
$400 to his mother for household needs; $100 for gasoline; $275 in repayment of a car
loan;  $150  for  cellphone  service;  $300  for  groceries;  $100  for  alcohol;  and  $200  for
cigarettes. Applicant was unable to recall the details of his student loans, but he planned to
gather his financial paperwork for the OPM investigator. (GE 2.)
On April 6, 2018, Applicant was re-interviewed by the OPM investigator. Applicant
provided tax records showing he had made some student loan payments in 2015 and
2017; a settlement letter for his private student loans (SOR ¶ 1.c and an unalleged loan
with a $25,479 principal balance); garnishment paperwork showing $1,296 had been taken
from his pay toward his federal loans; and documentation of his satisfaction of judgment #1
in October 2017 through wage attachment. Applicant expressed an intention to eventually
satisfy his delinquencies. (GE 2.)
As of April 2018, Applicant was past due $129 on a federal student loan with a
$2,184 balance (SOR ¶ 1.a) and $71 past due on a federal student loan with a $1,212
balance (SOR ¶ 1.b). The private student loan that had been charged off for $50,607 (SOR
¶ 1.c) had been removed from his credit report (GE 4), although it had not been satisfied.
Applicant had retained the services of a law firm to clean up his credit record, and the law
firm successfully had that loan removed from his credit record. (AE D.)
On May 11, 2018, Applicant began making $100 weekly student-loan payments.
Beginning  on  August  17,  2018,  he  lowered  his  weekly  payment  to  $50.  With  limited
exception,  he  made  his  weekly  payments  on  time.  His  payments  were  applied  to  the
interest owed on his loans. (AE C; Tr. 20, 28, 51.) The transaction record of his account as
reported by the lender does not identify the loan or loans to which his payments were
applied,  although  a  resolution  agreement  for  his  private  student  loans  with  the  lender
suggests that the payments went toward his private student loans.5 (AE C.)
On April 6, 2018, Applicant was re-interviewed by the OPM investigator. Applicant
provided tax records showing he had made some student loan payments in 2015 and
2017; a settlement letter for his private student loans (SOR ¶ 1.c and an unalleged loan
with a $25,479 principal balance); garnishment paperwork showing $1,296 had been taken
from his pay toward his federal loans; and documentation of his satisfaction of judgment #1
in October 2017 through wage attachment. Applicant expressed an intention to eventually
satisfy his delinquencies. (GE 2.)
As of April 2018, Applicant was past  due $129 on a federal student loan with a
$2,184 balance (SOR ¶ 1.a) and $71 past due on a federal student loan with a $1,212
balance (SOR ¶ 1.b). The private student loan that had been charged off for $50,607 (SOR
¶ 1.c) had been removed from his credit report (GE 4), although it had not been satisfied.
Applicant had retained the services of a law firm to clean up his credit record, and the law

On May 11, 2018, Applicant began making $100 weekly student-loan payments.
Beginning  on  August  17,  2018,  he  lowered  his  weekly  payment  to  $50.  With  limited
5 The same lender holds the private student loans and his outstanding Stafford federal loans. The payments
were applied to the account number ending in x4034. (AE C.) However, the resolution agreement for his
private  student  loans  shows  that  he  had  paid  $1,900  toward  the  student  loans  before  entering  into  the
resolution agreement (AE A), and the payments credited to the account ending in x4034 totaled $1,924,
inclusive of fees. (AE C.)
exception,  he  made  his  weekly  payments  on  time.  His  payments  were  applied  to  the
interest owed on his loans. (AE C; Tr. 20, 28, 51.) The transaction record of his account as
reported by the  lender does not identify the loan or loans to which his payments were
applied,  although  a  resolution  agreement  for  his  private  student  loans  with  the  lender
suggests that the payments went toward his private student loans.6 (AE C.)
Applicant earned between $500 and $600 a week in his defense-contractor job. (Tr.
38-39.) As of May 2018, he was current on a car loan obtained in November 2017 for
$15,897 being repaid at $275 per month. He was also making timely payments on a credit-
card account opened in February 2015. His account had a $2,549 balance. (GE 4.) He
provided no evidence of an unexpected circumstance that could explain or justify why he
was over two months behind on his federal student loans with scheduled terms of $33 and
$17 a month (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b). (GE 4.)
In  September  2018,  Applicant  applied  for  two  open  entry-level  positions  at  his
employment toward becoming either an electrical draftsman or a structural/arrangements
draftsman. He was selected for interviews that never took place. (AE F.) On October 19,
2018, the DOD CAF issued the SOR to Applicant because of his delinquent student loans
and the unpaid judgment for $1,304 (SOR ¶ 1.f). His interim clearance was withdrawn, and
he was walked off the job.7 (Tr. 30, 33.) He received his last paycheck in late October 2017
and  had  no  income  for  about  a  month  until  he  began  receiving  unemployment
compensation of $360 a week in December 2018. (Tr. 38-39, 45-48, 56, 61.)
As of November 2018, Applicant’s federal student loan in SOR ¶ 1.a had a $2,198
balance with a scheduled repayment at $33.67 per month for 81 months. (AE B.) The
balance of the loan in SOR ¶ 1.b was approximately $1,200. Applicant believes that the
federal student loans in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e are no longer owed; that they were either paid
or are the same loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. (Tr. 55.) Applicant testified that he
had been repaying both loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b) together at $68 a month. He admitted
being “a little late” on his payment as of his hearing for his clearance eligibility. (Tr. 51-53.)
On November 5, 2018, Applicant entered into a resolution agreement for his private
student loans (SOR ¶ 1.c, balance $74,594, and unalleged loan balance $53,201, after
having paid $1,900 toward the loans).  A collection entity agreed to settle both loans for
only  $10,966  and  to  accept  installment  payments.  (AE  A.)  Under  the  terms  of  the
settlement, Applicant was required to pay $200 a month from November 30, 2018, through
August 30, 2022. (AE A), with interest on the loans continuing to accrue until the settlement
amount is satisfied. Applicant was advised that should he miss a payment, any amounts
paid under the settlement would not be counted toward the debt. Applicant paid $250 in

were applied to the account number ending in x4034. (AE C.) However, the resolution agreement for his
private  student  loans  shows  that  he  had  paid  $1,900  toward  the  student  loans  before  entering  into  the
resolution agreement (AE A), and the payments credited to the account ending in x4034 totaled $1,924,

favorably.
December 2018. He has not made any payments since January 2019. He contacted the
collection entity and was advised that his loans had been transferred again. As of April
2019, he was awaiting word from the new entity whether the settlement offer was still valid.
(AE H; Tr. 45-50.)
As  of  April  2019,  Applicant  had  made  no  payments  on  the  $1,304  credit-card
judgment (SOR ¶ 1.f). Sometime after he answered the SOR,  Applicant contacted the
collection attorney, and promised that he would make weekly payments once he returns to
work. (Tr. 53-55.)
Applicant  stopped  paying  his  mother  rent  of  $400  a  month  when  he  became
unemployed in October 2018. He pays $50 to $60 of their cellphone costs. He also pays
his  car  loan  at  $275  per  month,  car  insurance  at  $112  per  month,  and  his  grocery
expenses. He was paying $68 a month toward his student loans in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b.
(Tr. 58-59.) Applicant received an income tax refund of “a little under $1,000” for tax year
2018 that gave him a financial cushion while unemployed. (Tr. 60-61.)
