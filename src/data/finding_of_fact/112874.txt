Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since 2015. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has
held with some breaks for many years. He attended community college for a period in
the 1980s, but he did not earn a degree. He is married without children.1
Applicant lived overseas for a number of years before 2000 and did not have to
file  state  income  tax  returns.  He  always  prepared  his  own  federal  income  tax  returns.
He  moved  to  his  current  state  in  about  2000.  He  found  the  state  returns  to  be  more
difficult  to  prepare  than  his  federal  returns.  He  admitted  that  he  is  not  good  with
numbers,  and  he  was  too  embarrassed  to  ask  for  help.  He  also  thought  that  he  had
enough withheld from his pay that he would not owe the state any additional taxes.  He
filed  all  his federal returns  as  required,  but he  did not file his state  income  tax  returns
when they were due for tax years 2001 through 2014.2
Applicant reported his failure to file his state income tax returns on his May 2016
Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86),  and  he  discussed  the  matter
during his background interview in October 2017. He hired H&R Block; and he filed his
2001, 2006, and 2012 through 2014 state income tax returns in 2016. He filed his 2015
through  2018  state  income  tax  returns  in  October  2016,  July  2017,  March  2018,  and
March 2019. His remaining state returns were filed in 2018 and 2019. His state imposed
$50 penalties for not filing the older returns, even when there were no taxes due. All of
his state income taxes are paid, including $730 in penalties and $576 in interest.3
Applicant testified that he did not truly appreciate the significance of his failing to
file his state returns. He does now. He plans to continue using H&R Block to prepare his
returns.  He  credibly  testified  that  he  will  file  all  future  state  and  federal  income  tax
returns and pay any taxes owed when they are due. There are no other issues about his
finances.4
