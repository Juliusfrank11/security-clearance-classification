In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  admitted  filing  for  bankruptcy  protection
three times, and admitted Federal income tax debts for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2016,
but  stated her  tax  returns for 2014, 2015, and  2016  had been filed.  She  asserted  one
credit report indicated the debts in SOR 1.i, SOR 1.j, SOR 1.k, and SOR 1.l were reported
as paid in full with zero balances. Other credit reports do not show the debts as paid. She
indicated the debts in SOR 1.h and SOR 1.m through SOR 1.r are included in her Chapter
13, Wage Earners’ Plan bankruptcy. She stated she owes nothing on the judgment listed
in  SOR  1.s  ($8,598),  which  involves  the  same  creditor  as  the  debt  listed  in  SOR  1.h
($19,182). She did not explain why she no longer owed the delinquent obligations. She
stated that in the current year, she anticipates she and her husband’s gross income for
2019  will  be  more  than  $275,000.  (SOR  Response)  After  a  thorough  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 44-year-old engineer who has worked for a defense contractor since
January 2018 and seeks to obtain a security clearance. (Ex. 2, Tr. 31, 44) She held a
secret clearance while working for a defense contractor from 2003 to 2013. (Ex. 1, 2, Tr.
5) From April 2013 to January 2017 and from May 2017 to September 2017, she was
unemployed. (Ex. 2) She has not served in the U.S. military. She is married, has a step-
daughter age 25, and three children ages 9, 8, and 6. (Ex. 2) In May 2002, she obtained
a master’s degree in engineering. (Ex. 3, Tr. 13) Her annual salary is $145,000. (Tr. 61)
Her husband currently has three jobs, one with an $185,000 annual salary and the other
two positions paying between $15,000 and $45,000 annually. (Tr. 62) He also receives
book royalties. Between 2014 and December 2018, Applicant and her husband filed for
bankruptcy protection three times. (Ex. 5, 6, 7)
In 2008, Applicant purchased a house on the east coast and lived in the home until
March 2014. (Tr. 114) At that time, the home was rented to a friend who live there until
2015.  In  2015,  Applicant  and  her  spouse  moved  from  the  east  coast  to  their  current
location. (Tr. 24) When Applicant asked her husband about the  status of the home, he
told her it had been sold. However, it had not been sold, but went to foreclosure. (Tr. 115)
Her husband had used a power of attorney from Applicant in dealing with the house.
In  2013,  when  Applicant’s  maternity  leave  ended  following  the  birth  of  her  third
child, she chose to take time off from her job with a defense contractor to take care of her
three children. (Tr. 6, 35) Her oldest child was age four, and she had recently learned her
second child has autism and learned her spouse also has autism. (Tr. 17, 34, 100) When
she  resigned,  her  annual  salary  was  approximately  $120,000.  (Tr.  35)  Shortly  after
Applicant had resigned from her job, her spouse was laid off from his job with a defense
contractor  when  the  contract  he  was  working  on  ended.  (Tr.  6)  Applicant  was  not
intimately involved with the family’s finances. (Ex. 17)  In their household, her husband
handled the payment of bills. (Tr. 32) Whenever she asked her husband about their debts,
she was told everything was “squared away,’” and when she asked about their tax returns,
he stated “Yes, I’m on top of it. I sent it in.” (Tr. 46) In her August 2018 interview, she
stated  she trusted  her husband 100  percent  and had no  idea  where  their  income  was
used. (Ex. 3)
From April 2012 through December 2016, during the time Applicant was at home
with  her  children,  their  joint  household  income  exceeded  $300,000.  (Ex.  F,  Tr.  63)
Applicant’s and her spouse’s 2014 Federal income tax return was timely filed on March
3, 2015. (Ex. F) In February 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and submitted copies
of their 2015 and 2016 Federal tax returns dated October 2017, both of which would have
been late filings. (SOR Response, Tr. 71) The tax transcripts show  their 2015 Federal
income tax return was filed in March 2018 and their 2016 Federal income tax return was
filed February 2018. (Ex. G, Tr. 72) Applicant’s husband asserted that, in the past, he had
established payment plans with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The plans were not
further explained in the record. (Tr. 74)
The copy of Applicant’s 2016 Federal tax return submitted with her response to the
SOR  indicates  wages  of  $340,475  and  an  adjusted  gross  income  of  $322,715  with
$10,483  of  Federal  income  tax  withheld.  The  2016  tax  transcript  stated  the  Federal
income tax liability was $71,736 plus $2,165 interest charged for late payment. (Ex. G)
In October 2018, when Applicant submitted her response to written interrogatories,
she submitted a copy of an unsigned and undated 2017 joint Federal tax return. (Ex 3) A
tax transcript for tax year 2017 is not contained in the record. A May 10, 2019 letter from
the IRS indicated a request for a 2017 transcript had been received, but the IRS could
not  process  the  request  at  that  time.  (Ex.  F)  The  2017  tax  return  she  presented  in
response to the written interrogatories indicated $6,847 in wages and a business loss of
$40,436, which was listed as wages paid an assistant. (Ex. 3) Information about this loss
due to a paid assistant is not contained in the record. The return lists an adjusted gross
income of $2,472, and $356 in Federal income tax withheld. (Ex. 3) The return also claims
$36,061 income listed on a 1099 MISC, not further explained. Based on the return they
anticipated an $880 refund. (Ex. 3)
In the October 2017 bankruptcy filing, Applicant and her husband claimed monthly
income of $12,061. (Ex. 5, page 35 of 43)  She did not explain why the bankruptcy for
listed $12,061 in monthly income but their joint Federal tax return lists a total income for
the year of $6,847. During 2017, Applicant was unemployed from May 2017 to September
2017.  During  that  year,  a  contract  her  husband  had  been  working  on  ended,  and  he
became  involved  with  a  number  of  start-up  companies.  (Tr. 97) Her husband  received
little compensation for his work with the start-up companies. (Tr. 97) As previously stated,
her husband also receives royalties from a number of books he has written. (Tr. 99)
Applicant asserts she had difficulties receiving her mail at times. In February 2019,
she was very surprised when she received the bills for her son’s medical treatment. (Tr.
23) The company said they had sent invoices for $3,704 for medical treatment provided
between May 2018 and October 2018. (Ex. B) Applicant claimed the invoices were never
received. In March 2019, the company was paid $1,904 for services received. (Ex. B) She
asserts a similar event occurred over a bill for pool service. She claims she never received
a  $1,380  invoice  for  pool  services  before  being  sued  by  the  pool  company  for  unpaid
services. Once notified, the debt was paid in March 2019. (Ex. C) She has asserted that
she  had  not  received  mail  sent  to  her  including  Christmas  cards.  (Ex.  C)  Applicant
obtained a post office box to alleviate the mail problem. (Tr. 108)
At the hearing, Applicant asserted for 2016 their household income was $340,000
with $10,000 being withheld to pay Federal income tax. (Tr. 9) This left a tax balance due
of $60,000. In January 2019, Applicant and her spouse agreed to pay $495,590 through
a Chapter 13, Wage Earners’ Plan, with payments of approximately $8,200 per month.
(Tr.  9,  28)  The  amount  to  be  paid  in  the  plan  varied  greatly  depending  on  which
bankruptcy documents are reviewed. The monthly payment also includes mortgage and
vehicle payments in additional to payment on the Federal tax bill. Applicant anticipated
she and her husband’s household income for 2019 would total approximately $275,000.
(Tr. 9)
On Applicant’s 2009 e-QIP, she did not list any financial difficulties because at the
time  she  was  not  experiencing  any  financial  problems.  (Ex.  1)  In  November  2017,  an
$8,598  civil  judgment  was  entered  against  Applicant,  which  she  did  not  list  on  her
February 2018 e-QIP. (Ex. 2, 7) On the same e-QIP, she listed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy
filed in October 2017, but failed to list her October 2014 bankruptcy filing. In the e-QIP,
she  stated,  “I have  no  debt  under my  name  and  was  cleared  of  all  debt.”  (Ex.  2)  She
answered “no” when asked if she had failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes,
and she did not list any delinquencies involving routine accounts.  She indicated “no” in
February 2018, when asked about the non-filing of taxes even though she had attended
the October 2017 bankruptcy debtors’ meeting where the IRS debt of more than $100,000
was discussed. She asserted she believed all the debts had been satisfied.
In Applicant’s October 2018 Response to Written Interrogatories, she indicated all
her debts had been either addressed or were being addressed. (Ex. 3) She did not explain
or provide documentation showing the debts were being addressed. At the time of her
February 2018 e-QIP response, the 2017 bankruptcy had not yet been dismissed.
In October 2014, Applicant and her husband (debtors) jointly filed for bankruptcy
protection under Chapter 13, the Wage Earner’s Plan. The bankruptcy listed $42,327 in
secured claims and $75,198 in unsecured claims, which totaled $117,526. (Ex. 4) The
unsecured claims included some of the SOR delinquent obligations: SOR 1.j ($9,086),
SOR 1.k ($8,237), SOR 1.n ($5,245), SOR 1.o ($1,583), and SOR 1.p ($767). (Ex. 4) At
that  time  mortgage  arrearages  were  $21,988  on  a  $275,254  mortgage.  The  house
eventually went to foreclosure. No principal or interest were paid on the claims. In May
2015, the debtors were dismissed and in October 2015, the bankruptcy terminated. (Ex.
4) The debtor’s requested a voluntary dismissal. When a Chapter 13 case is dismissed,
the debts are not discharged. (Ex. 5)
In Applicant’s June 2018 Enhanced Subject Interview, she indicated she had no
knowledge that a bankruptcy had been filed in October 2014. (Ex. 3) During the interview,
when  asked  about  delinquent  obligations  on  her  credit  report,  she  had  no  knowledge
about  the  following  delinquent  obligations:  SOR  1.i,  $439;  SOR  1.j,  $9,086;  SOR  1.k,
$28,237; SOR1.n, $5,245; SOR 1.o, $1,583; SOR 1.p, $767; and SOR 1.r, $6,761. (Ex.
3)  She  indicated  the  $3,206  (SOR  1.l)  automobile  debt  may  have  been  for  a  car
purchased for her step-daughter. (Ex. 3, Tr. 85) The vehicle was repossessed. (Ex. 9, Tr.
82) The last payment before repossession occurred in 2016. (Ex. 9, Tr. 84) She did not
disclose any repossessions on her February 2018 e-QIP. (Ex. 2)
Applicant  believes  a  $19,182  delinquent  obligation  (SOR  1.h)  was  unpaid  or
overdue rent owed an apartment complex. (Ex. 7, Tr. 39) She has not investigated the
debt and only learned of it during the security clearance process. (Tr. 35) It was included
in her 2017 bankruptcy filing. (Tr. 60) The debt in SOR 1.h ($19,182) and judgement in
SOR  1.s  ($8,598)  are  with  the  same  corporation  that  owns  apartment  complexes
throughout the country. However, the debt in SOR 1.h is for unpaid rent on a rental unit
on the east coast and the debt in SOR 1.s is for an apartment in the state where Applicant
currently  resides.  (Tr.  87)  Their  bankruptcy  attorney  has  asked  the  corporation  for  an
accounting of the two debts. (Tr. 87) No information was received concerning the results
of the request for accounting.
Applicant had no knowledge about the $28,237 charged off debt (SOR 1.k). (Tr.
78) An  automobile  was  purchased for $33,000  and $23,000  was  charged-off to profits
and losses. (Ex. 8, Tr. 79) The vehicle debt was never paid, but Applicant believes her
credit report reflects a zero balance on the debt. (Tr. 80) Applicant asserts the $6,761
joint travel card debt (SOR 1.r) is included in the bankruptcy. (Tr. 86)
At the hearing, Applicant stated she did not find out about the 2014 filing until the
second bankruptcy was filed in October 2017. (Ex. 3, Tr. 40) She did not explain how she
failed to know about the joint filing. She testified when she found out about the 2014 filing,
she asserted she was very angry with her husband for filing under her name, without her
knowledge, and asserted that she never having signed any paperwork. (Tr. 42) When she
discovered  the  2014  bankruptcy  had  been  filed,  she  did  not  review  the  filing.  (Tr.  43)
During Applicant’s June 2018 Enhanced Subject Interview, which was seven months after
the October 2017 bankruptcy filing, she stated she had no knowledge of any such action
being filed in 2014. (Ex. 3)
In October 2017, Applicant and her husband filed for bankruptcy protection under
Chapter 13, Wage Earner’s Plan. Applicant never contacted the bankruptcy attorney or
verified the status of the bankruptcy after the initial filing. (Tr. 45) The bankruptcy listed
assets of approximately $30,000, secured debt of approximately $35,000, and unsecured
debt  of  $225,000.  (Ex.  5,  page  41)  A  $102,564  student  loan  debt  was  listed  in  the
bankruptcy  filing.  (Ex.  5,  pages  30  and  42)  Their  household’s  monthly  income  was
approximately $12,000 with monthly expenses of $6,000. (Ex. 5 pages 35 and 36) The
projected  monthly  Chapter 13  plan payment was  $788.  (Ex.  5)  The  plan  listed  no  real
estate  and  listed  two  vehicles  valued  at  $35,000.  Approximately  $18,000  of  the  motor
vehicle debt was unsecured. (Ex. 5, pages 16-18 of 43)
Applicant was surprised in March 2018, when her husband told her the bankruptcy
filed in October 2017 was being dismissed. (Ex. 5, Tr. 52) She asked her husband how
the debts ($225,091) had been dismissed in the six months, from October 2017 to March
2018. When informed the bankruptcy was dismissed, Applicant was under the erroneous
impression that the process was over and they were then debt free. (Tr. 52) Her husband
told her he had paid $500 a month for six months and the debts were dismissed. The
dismissal was due to Applicant and her spouse failing to cooperate with the bankruptcy
trustee as necessary to enable the trustee to perform the trustee’s duties. (Ex. 3)
Applicant and her spouse object to the IRS’s claim of a $179,774 tax delinquency.
(Ex. 5) The IRS claimed a priority claim of $62,920 and an unsecured claim of $45,255.
Applicant first saw, the history of the October 2017 bankruptcy filing documents (Ex. 5) at
the hearing. (Tr. 47) Applicant’s husband believes they owe the IRS $130,000. (Tr. 64)
Applicant testified she knew in October 2017 there was a tax debt, but did not know the
details of the debt even though they reviewed the bankruptcy filing, line by line, with their
bankruptcy  attorney.  (Tr.  47)  A  representative  from  the  IRS  attended  the  debtors’
conference. (Tr. 47) In a post-hearing submission, she asserted that her 2016 and 2017
tax returns were “being reviewed due to them [IRS] concluding we were the victims of ID
Theft.” (Ex. F) She did not make this claim at the hearing and provided no documentation
from the IRS supporting her assertion of review by the IRS.
The IRS wage and income transcripts in evidence presented indicate Applicant’s
and her spouse’s joint income between 2009 and 2018 was not lower than $129,000. (Ex.
F) Joint income: in 2012 was $203,809; in 2013, $312,737; in 2014, $129,190; in 2015,
$134,703;  in  2018,  $154,783;  and  for  tax  year  2016,  an  adjusted  gross  income  of
$322,715. (Ex. F, G) The tax transcript for tax year 2014 indicated $1,052 in Federal tax
was owed. (Ex. F) In April 2018, the IRS sent Applicant and her spouse a Notice of Intent
to seize (levy) on their property and that $1,825 was immediately due for tax year 2014.
(Ex. 3)
In 2015, Applicant and her spouse moved to a state that does not have a state
individual  income  tax.  No  information  was  alleged  or  presented  concerning  any  state
income taxes owed at their previous state of residence. An IRS tax account transcript for
tax year 2016 indicated $71,736 in Federal tax was owed and $10,483 had been withheld.
(Ex. G) This left a balance due of $61,253 plus $2,165 interest on the late payment, for a
total due of $63,418. (Ex. G) In May 2019, the IRS sent notification that Applicant and her
spouse’s $880 refund for tax year 2017 had been intercepted and applied to her 2013 tax
debt. (Ex. G) This left a tax debt of $47,008 for tax year 2013. (Ex. G)
In  December  2018,  Applicant  and  her  husband  again  filed  for  bankruptcy
protection under Chapter 13. (Ex. 6, the document indicated it is 46 pages, but the record
fails to contain 46 pages for this document). The bankruptcy listed a secured claim for a
home valued at $575,000 with monthly mortgage payments of $5,702 and two secured
claims for motor vehicles valued at $52,000. (Ex. C, Ex. 6, page 9 and 10 of 46) At the
date of filing, Applicant’s husband believed the mortgage was current, but did not explain
how it was $28,000 delinquent in earlier filings and was current at the time of filing. They
owed approximately $200 more on the home than the value of the house. The plan listed
assets of $666,400 and liabilities of $648,076. (Ex. 6, page 34) Unsecured debt totaled
$24,712. (Ex. 6, page 5 of 13) The amount of student loan debt is not listed in the 2018
bankruptcy  documents.  The  fact  that  student  loans  are  not  normally  dischargeable  in
bankruptcy  may  explain  the  reason  the  student  loan  debt  is  not  listed  in  the  latest
bankruptcy filing.
Bankruptcy documents dated January 2019 reflect the projected monthly Chapter
13 plan payment started at $8,259 per month and will increased over the five years of the
plan  to  $15,275  monthly.  (Ex.  C)  Her  husband  stated  the  monthly  payment  is
automatically  deducted  from  his  and  his  wife’s  pay.  (Tr.  99)  Applicant  asserted  that
following the hearing, she would provide documentation showing timely payment of the
monthly payment. (Tr. 117)
In  June  2019,  the  bankruptcy  plan  was  confirmed.  The  order  confirming  the
Chapter 13 plan states the debtors (Applicant and her spouse) will pay $719,520 over a
60 month period starting in January 2019. (Ex. H) Monthly payments are to start at $8,260
monthly, to increase to $11,000 monthly in January 2020, increase to $12,500 monthly in
January 2021, and then increase to $14,000 monthly in January 2022 until the 60-month
plan is completed. (Ex. H) The majority of the monthly payment would go to the secured
debts, which would include the $5,702 monthly mortgage payment, the car payments for
the  two  cars,  and  the  IRS  debt.  In  February  2019,  a  wage  directive  information  sheet
directed Applicant’s husband’s employer to deduct $6,000 per month or $2,768 bi-weekly
and the amount was to be paid to the bankruptcy trustee. (Ex. D) A similar directive to
Applicant’s employer directed that $2,260 monthly or $1,043 bi-weekly be withheld and
paid to the trustee (Ex. D)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  submitted  bank  statements  showing  payment  to  the
bankruptcy trustee of approximately $260 each on January 28, 2019, February 5, 2019,
February 19, 2019, March 1, 2019, March 18, 2019, and on April 1, 2019. (Ex. B) These
six payments total $1,560. Following the hearing, Applicant submitted leave and earning
statements  from  her  employer  for  March,  April,  May,  and  June  2019  showing  the
deductions from her pay that were sent to the bankruptcy trustee (Ex. D, E, G) As of June
6,  2016,  $7,301  had  been  deducted  from  Applicant’s  pay.  No  leave  and  earning
documents were submitted showing deductions from her husband’s pay, but a bankruptcy
document showed her husband’s employer had submitted five payments totaling $16,836
in January through March 2019, plus one payment by him, with all of the payments on his
behalf  totaling  $36,438.  (Ex.  D)  During  the  same  period,  Applicant’s  employer.  The
combined  payments  totaled  $53,274.  From  February  through  May  2019,  Applicant
submitted cashier’s checks to the trustee totaling $24,491. (Ex. D, E) From January 2019
through June 2019, Applicant has documented payments of $86,626 to the bankruptcy
trustee from January 2019 through June 2019. (Ex. D, E, G)
In  December  2018,  Applicant’s  household’s  monthly  income  was  $26,900  with
monthly expenses of approximately $10,000. (Ex. 6, page 2 and 3 of 12) The projected
monthly Chapter 13 plan payment started at $8,259 per month and increased over the
course of the plan to $15,275 monthly. (Ex. 6, page 2 of 13) Their monthly home mortgage
payment  was  $5,700  and  the  IRS  monthly  payment  was  $950  on  an  amount  owed  of
$145,807. (Ex. 6, page 4 of 13, Ex. C) The IRS submitted a priority claim of $62,920 and
an unsecured claim of $45,255. The record does not reconcile the discrepancy in the tax
delinquency claimed by the IRS.
During their December 2018 bankruptcy filing, Applicant and her husband sought
the  services  of  a  tax  accountant.  (Tr.  49)  Her  husband  hired  the  tax  accountant,  and
Applicant did not know the details of the hiring, actions taken by the tax accountant, or
the  results  obtained.  (Tr.  50)  Bankruptcy  documents  also  show  the  IRS  was  claiming
Applicant  and  her  husband  owed  a  lesser  amount  of  $120,303  in  taxes.  (Ex.  E)  That
amount represents a secured claim of $43,076, an unsecured priority claim of $66,001,
an  unsecured  claim  for  interest  of  $5,151,  and  an  unsecured  claim  for  tax  penalty  of
$5,450. The difference in values claimed was not further delineated in the record.
In January 2019, the Applicant’s and her spouse’s Chapter 13 Plan listed $83,093
unsecured debt, which included all of the SOR charged-off and collection accounts except
for the $9,986 charged-off bank debt (SOR 1.j). (Ex. C) The plan included: SOR 1.h and
1.s, $27,780; SOR 1.i, $439; SOR 1.k, $28,237; SOR 1.m, $922; SOR 1.n, $5,245; SOR
1.o, $1,583; SOR 1.p, $767; SOR 1.q, $669; and SOR 1.r, $6,761. (Ex. C)The unsecured
claims also include a $3,459 hospital debt not listed as a debt of concern in the SOR. The
June 11, 2019 Order Confirming the Chapter 13 plan lists the secured creditors by name,
but does not specifically list the unsecured creditor by name. (Ex. H)
In March 2019, the bankruptcy court ordered Applicant and her spouse to complete
an instructional course in personal financial management. She indicated that she had to
take a four-hour credit counseling class for the bankruptcy. (Ex. 3)
Applicant  has  opened  a  separate  checking  account  for  her  salary  to  which  her
husband  does  not  have  access.  (Tr.  3,  50)  They  ended  their  joint  accounts.  They  no
longer have credit cards, only debit cards. (Tr. 50) She asserted that she is now “intimately
involved in paying the bills and making sure that they’re paid and that we get confirmation
of payment received.” (Tr. 102) To reduce expenses, they have dismissed their part-time
nanny and a tutor. (Tr.121)
Character Evidence
Applicant submitted several Performance and Development Summaries showing
her job assessment, her key strengths, and performance ratings. (Ex. A) For 2003 and
2012 she was rated as “Meets Requirements,” for 2004, 2009, 2010, and 2011 her rating
was “Exceeds Requirements,” and for 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 she was rated as “Far
Exceeds Requirements.” Her 2018 rating was “Highly Effective Contribution.” (Ex. A)
Applicant is a deputy team lead recently promoted to section manager, where she
will be the direct supervisor of 12 to 15 engineers. (Ex. H) Her team lead, who has worked
with  Applicant  for  a  year  and  a  half,  stated  Applicant  consistently  delivers  on  her
commitments  without  fail.  (Ex.  H)  Their  team  of  40  individuals  values  accountability,
transparency,  integrity,  and  commitment.  The  team  lead  states  Applicant  exemplifies
these values. (Ex. H)
