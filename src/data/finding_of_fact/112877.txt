In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and
2.a-2.o. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 3.b. He did not specifically
admit  or  deny  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  3.a,  which  cross-alleges  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  1.c,
and 2.b. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 39-year-old sheet metal worker employed by a defense contractor
since  November  2016.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from  March  2003  to  September
2016.  While  on  active  duty,  he  received  nonjudicial  punishment  for  misuse  of  a
government credit card by buying dinner for family members. (FORM Item 2 at 46.) He
was  reduced  from  petty  officer  first  class  (E-6)  to  petty  officer  second  class  (E-5)  and
restricted  to  the  barracks  for  21  days.  (FORM  Item  3,  Personal  Subject  Interview  in
February 2018 (PSI) at 6.)
On April 30, 2013, Applicant’s wife sought treatment at a military medical facility
for  neck  pain.  She  told  a  member  of  the  medical  staff  that  Applicant  had  choked  her
during  an  argument.  She  declined  to  make  a  written  statement.  Applicant  was
interviewed  and  admitted  grabbing  her  by  the  neck  on  several  occasions  during
arguments in March and April 2013. He was required to obtain counseling and attend an
anger management course. No disciplinary or criminal action was taken.
In June 2016, Applicant was arrested for felony embezzlement. He was working
part time at a department store and he bought multiple items, including a television set
and  cellphone,  on  layaway.  He  entered  false  information  into  the  store’s  data  system
reflecting that he was making payments on the items. He also took cash totaling about
$800  from  a  cash  register.  When  he  was  interviewed  by  store  investigators  in  June
2016,  he  attributed  his  criminal  conduct  to  financial  problems  caused  by  his  reduced
income after he was demoted for misconduct. (FORM Item 5.)
In  April  2017,  Applicant  was  convicted  of  felony  embezzlement  from  the
department  store.  He  was  sentenced  to  121  days  in  jail  and  placed  on  probation  for
three years, until April 2020. He was ordered to pay restitution of $4,860. He was fired
from his part-time job and prohibited from entering the store’s premises. (FORM Item 6
at 3; FORM Item 7.) In the PSI and Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he stated that the
offense was reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor after he made restitution. There
are  no  court  documents  in  the  record  reflecting  a  reduction  of  the  offense  to  a

otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
misdemeanor.  In  September  2016,  he  was  discharged  from  the  Navy  with  an  “other
than  honorable”  discharge.  He  was  unemployed  after  his  discharge  until  he  was  hired
for his current job. He has never held a security clearance.
Applicant has taken college courses since October 2016 but has not received a
degree. He married in December 2004, divorced in April 2007, and married his current
spouse in December 2011. He has a seven-year-old son and three stepchildren, ages
21, 17, and 11.
The  SOR  ¶¶  1.c-1.o  alleges  13  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $33,000,  which
are  reflected  in  credit  reports  from  March  2017  (FORM  Item  9)  and  November  2018
(FORM Item 10). The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below.
SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.k:  two  unsecured  loans  from  the  same  creditor  charged
off for $9,454 and $3,051. The November 2018 credit report reflects that both accounts
are current. (FORM Item 10 at 4.)
SOR ¶ 1.f: account past due for $3,418. In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he
claimed  that  this  debt  was  paid,  but  he  submitted  no  documentation  to  support  his
claim.
SOR  ¶  1.g:  credit-card  account  placed  for  collection  of  $452.  In  Applicant’s
answer to the SOR, he submitted documentary evidence showing that he was making
payments on this debt.
Applicant  submitted  no  evidence  of  payments,  payment  agreements,  or  other
resolution  of  the  delinquent  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.d  (unsecured  loan  placed  for
collection  of  $6,372);  ¶  1.e  (unsecured  loan  past  due  for  $3,556);  ¶  1.h  (medical  bill
placed  for  collection  of  $264);  ¶  1.i  (credit-card  account  charged  off  for  $423);  ¶  1.j
(dental bill placed for collection of $235); ¶ 1.l (unsecured loan charged off for $4,464); ¶
1.m (unsecured loan placed for collection of $1,257); ¶ 1.n (credit-card account placed
for collection of $468), and ¶ 1.o (credit-card account placed for collection of $479).
When Applicant submitted his SCA in November 2016, he did not disclose any of
the  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  He  disclosed  his  misuse  of  the  government  credit  card
and  an  unalleged  delinquent  car  loan  for  $10,000  that  was  resolved  by  repossession.
He answered “no” to all the questions in Section 26, which included questions asking if,
in the past seven years, he had defaulted on any type of loan; had bills or debts turned
over to a collection agency; had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or
cancelled  for  failing  to  pay  as  agreed;  or  had  been  over  120  days  delinquent  on  any
debt not previously entered. (FORM Item 2 at 47-49.) In the PSI, he did not disclose the
delinquent debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.o until the investigator confronted him with the
evidence.  (PSI  at  11.)  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  denied  intentionally  falsifying  his
SCA, claiming that he was confused by the questions.
