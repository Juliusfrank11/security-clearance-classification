Applicant  denied  the  SOR  allegations,  except  for  SOR  1.i,  a  debt  which  she
planned to settle. She is a 46-year-old senior configuration analyst technician employed
by  a  U.S.  defense  contractor  since  January  2017.  She  has  held  similar  jobs  since
December  2004,  except  for  being  unemployed  from  October  to  November  2009,
November  2013  to  June  2014,  and  from  July  to  August  2015.  She  had  favorable
background investigations in February 2002 and May 2010 (Item 4).
The  SOR  alleges,  and  Government  exhibits  (Items 4-8)  establish,  10  delinquent
debts  totaling  nearly  $25,000  (SOR  1.c-1.l).  Those  same  exhibits  show  that  Applicant
failed  to timely file her 2015-2017 state and Federal income tax returns (SOR 1.a-1.b).
Applicant’s  August  2018  credit  report  (Item  8)  and  a  creditor  receipt  she  sent  with  her
Answer show that SOR debt 1.h was paid in May 2017. She also sent a receipt showing
that SOR debt 1.k was paid in late December 2018 (Answer), after he received the SOR.
The  debts  comprise  two  voluntary  automobile  repossessions  totaling  over
$18,000  (SOR  1.c  and  1.g),  four  delinquent  utility  accounts  totaling  $1,200  (SOR  1.e,
1.h, and 1.k-1.l), $2,906 delinquent rent (SOR 1.I) and three delinquent consumer credit
accounts totaling over $1,900 (SOR 1.d, 1.f and 1.g). Applicant disclosed her failure to
file her state and Federal income tax returns, and listed SOR debts 1.d-1.f, 1.h, and 1.k,
on her January 2017 clearance application (Item 4).  She discussed her taxes and these
debts,  but  was  confronted  with  the  other  SOR  debts,  during  an  interview  with  a
Government  investigator  on  13  April  2018,  based  on  her  April  2017  credit  report  (Item
47).  She stated her intent to address the listed debts.
However, except as stated above, Applicant documented no efforts to address her
debts, either after her interview or after she received the SOR. She did not attribute her
financial problems to any particular circumstance, and she provided scant explanation of
her unemployment periods—the last  of  which ended in September 2016. She provided
no  budget  or  financial  statement.  She  has  not  documented  any  financial  or  credit
counseling.  She  provided  no  work  or  character  references,  or  any  evidence  of
community involvement.
