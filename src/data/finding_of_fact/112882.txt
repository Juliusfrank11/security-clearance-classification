Applicant  admitted   failing  to  timely   file  his   2012-2017  Federal  income  tax
returns, 3 and accumulating almost $8,900 delinquent debt.4 He is a 47-year-old program
manager employed by a U.S. defense  contractor since November 2012. He has  been
continuously  employed since January  2001. He served honorably  in the  U.S. military in
the   1990s,   during  which  time   he  held   a  clearance.  He  has  not   previously   held   an
industrial clearance (Item 3).
Applicant married  his  first  wife  in  June  1996,  and  they divorced in August 2010;
he remarried in October 2011 and  divorced in August 2012. He has three adult children
from his first marriage.
Applicant  disclosed   his  failure  to  file   his   2015  Federal  income  tax return  on  his
May  2017 clearance application (Item  3), and  discussed that return,  as well as his 2012
and   2016  returns,   and   SOR  debt  1.l,  during  his  September   2017   interview   with  a
Government  investigator  (Item   6),  based  on  his  June   2017  credit  report  (Item   5). 5   He
claimed to have placed  SOR debt  1.l in a debt consolidation  program in July 2017, and
to  be  working  with  a  tax  accountant.  In  his  November  2018   answer  to  DOHA
interrogatories (Item 6), he documented entering a commercial tax resolution program in
September  2018,  covering   his  2012-2017  Federal  income  taxes,  and   making  the   first
program  payment  in  October  2018.  He  later  documented   $900  monthly   payments  for
April  and   May   2019,  with  payments  scheduled   for  June-October  2019. 6   Applicant
claimed, but  did not  document,  having difficulty dealing with the  IRS. Thus,  he turned to
the tax resolution program to resolve his taxes, which remain unfiled.
Applicant’s March 2019 Answer (Item  2) contained an email, later confirmed  by a
more legible document from the  debt resolution program (Response),  reflecting that he
enrolled  seven  debts  totaling  $13,685.37  in  the   program,   and   settled  them  for
$7,086.54,  an  approximate  discount  of   48%. 7   The  settled  debts  include   a  debt  not
alleged in the SOR, SOR debts 1.c-1.e, SOR debts 1.h  and  1.l, and  a debt purporting to
be SOR debt 1.i. However, Applicant’s credit reports and  Response show that  the  debt
paid is not the debt alleged in the SOR.
Applicant’s  June   2017  credit  report  (Item   5),  reflects   that  Applicant  had   two
accounts  with  the   SOR  1.i  creditor,  one   opened   in  August  2015,  one   opened   in
3The Government withdrew SOR 1.b, regarding Applicant’s state income tax returns (FORM, p.2).
4He denied three debts totaling about $3,000, pending verification, which he apparently obtained later.
5The remaining SOR debts were taken from  Applicant’s September 2018 credit report,  which  was never
discussed with an investigator.
6It is unclear whether any portion of these payments is sent to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
7However, the documents do not indicate when each debt was satisfied.
November 2016. Each  account is identified by its full 16-digit account  number in Item  5.
At the  time, both accounts were current.  Applicant’s September 2018 credit report (Item
4) also lists both accounts. The August 2015 account is listed by the first four digits, four
x’s,  and  the  third four digits. The November 2016 account is listed by the  first 12 digits.
This  account  also  shows  that  it  was   closed  at  consumer’s  request  after  having  been
paid   for  less  than  full  balance  in  November  2017.  The  first  12  digits  under  which  the
account  is  listed in Item  4 match the  first 12 digits under which the  account is listed in
Item  5. The last four digits listed for this creditor in Applicant’s Response  match the  last
four  digits  in  Item   5.  Consequently,  the   debt  Applicant  paid   on  this  creditor  is  not   the
debt alleged at SOR 1.i, which remains unaddressed.
In  addition,  although  Applicant’s  June   2017  credit   report   (Item   5)  lists  only  one
delinquent SOR debt (SOR 1.l),8  it lists several debts which later became   SOR debts,
some  with  full  account   numbers,  that  were  current  at  the   time,  but   which  were
delinquent  on  the   September  2018  credit   report  (Item   4),  whether  still  held   by  the
original creditor or by a collection  agent.  First, SOR debt 1.c was current in June  2016,
listed under the original creditor, with a complete account number, but was delinquent in
September  2018  under  the   collection   agent. 9   The  last  four  digits listed  for  the   original
creditor  in  Applicant’s  response  matches  the   last  four  digits  of   the   original  creditor  in
Item  5. Second,  SOR 1.e  appears under the  original creditor, with full account number,
as current in Item  5, but  then tracks to Item  4 with the  first 12 digits as delinquent  but
transferred;  it  then  appears  under  the   SOR  1.e   collection   agent,  with  the   first  eight
digits. Again, the  last four digits listed for the  original  creditor in Applicant’s Response
matches the  last four digits of  the  original creditor in Item  5. Third,  SOR debt 1.h, with
full account number, was current on Item  5, but  was delinquent under the  same creditor
with  a   12-digit  account  number,  and   settled  under  the   last  four  digits  in  Applicant’s
Response.  Finally, SOR debt 1.k  was current,  with full account number,  on Item  5, but
was delinquent on Item  4 under the  first  four digits. Applicant claimed that he paid  this
creditor directly,  but  too  recently  for it to be reflected  on a credit report (Response). He
provided no confirmation of his claim to have paid SOR debt 1.g online.
Applicant’s Response contains an April 2019  email  from the  collection  agent for
SOR  debt  1.f,  acknowledging  Applicant’s  acceptance  of   the   collection   agent’s
settlement offer, but not containing any actual indication that the settlement amount was
paid. Similarly, Applicant provided an  April 2019 letter from the  collection  agent for SOR
debt 1.j asserting the  SOR amount alleged; Applicant annotated  the  letter that the  debt
was paid the same day, but did not otherwise document payment.
8SOR debt 1.l alleged an original creditor with an eight digit account number, being held  by  a collection  agent.
Applicant’s Response lists  only  the original creditor, under a last four digits that does not match Item  5. Only
the original creditor and original debt alleged connects the settlement payment to Item 5.
9Applicant gets some credit for connecting the creditor in Item  5 with the creditor in Item  4, given no obvious
connection in the credit reports.
Applicant attributes his financial problems to his  divorce, but  the  record evidence
does  not   support  that  claim.   He  provided   no  evidence  showing  that  his  August  2012
divorce caused  him  to not  file his 2012-2017 Federal income tax returnsnone  of  which
had  been filed over six years  after the  divorce. He failed to show that  the  ten  delinquent
debts—all of  which were listed as being opened  2015-2018—were caused by the  2012
divorce.10 He specifically stated that SOR debt 1.l was caused by his children going over
their minutes’ limits on their cell phones.
Applicant  documented  no  credit  or  financial  counseling,  and   did  not   submit  a
budget.  He  provided  no  work  or  character  references,  or  evidence  of   community
involvement. He submitted  no current credit reports which might have  corroborated  his
claimed payments.
