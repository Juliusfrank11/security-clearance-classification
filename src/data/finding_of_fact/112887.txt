The  SOR  alleges  foreign  influence  by  Applicant  because  his  immediate  family
members are citizens and residents of Kenya (SOR 1.a-1.g). Applicant’s ownership of a
home in Kenya (SOR 1.f) and the financial support he has provided to family members
in Kenya, and will provide in the future (SOR 1.g), raises additional concerns under the
foreign influence guideline. Applicant admitted all allegations.
Applicant,  born  in  Kenya  in  1979,  is  40  years  old  and  has  been  married  since
September  2006.  He  has  five  children  whose  ages  are  13,  10,  8,  and  6  years  of  age
(twins). In May 2006, he received a bachelor’s degree in computer science from another
African  country.  In  December  2015,  he  earned  a  master’s  degree  in  information
technology  from  an  American  university.  Applicant  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in
December 2009. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in March 2015. His wife was born
in Kenya in 1981. She is also a naturalized U.S. citizen. (Item 4 at 4 at 7-18, 19-20, 26,
67; Item 5 at 5; item 6 at 4-5)
Applicant  is  a  dual  citizen  of  the  U.S.  and  Kenya.  He  has  both  a  U.S.  passport
and  a  Kenyan  passport  that  is  not  scheduled  to  expire  until  January  2022.  He  has
expressed  his  intention  to  renounce  his  Kenyan  citizenship,  but  is  waiting  for the  U.S.
Government or his security clearance sponsor to instruct him to carry out his intention.
He  is  unable  to  begin  working  as  a  linguist  until  his  security  clearance  is  approved.
Applicant is currently working as a part-time taxi driver. From 2010 to September 2017,
he was employed as a business analyst for a business process company. He has never
had a security clearance. He has owned his American home since June 2017. (Item 4 at

Before immigrating to the United States in December 2009, Applicant lived with
his wife, a former Kenyan air force officer, on a Kenyan air force base from November
2007 to about June 2008. His wife resigned honorably from the military and they moved
to  a  location  near  the  base  until  they  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  December
2009. There is no indication in the record of his wife’s military position or how long she
was  in  the  military,  or  whether  she  receives  a  military  pension.  She  currently  is
employed  as  a  para  professional  for  a  public  school  system.  (Though  the  wife  is
unalleged in the SOR, evidence regarding her status will be presented under the whole-
person concept below.) (Item 4 at 4 at 7-18, 26, 67; Item 5 at 5; item 6 at 4-5, 16)
Applicant  stated  that  he  and  his  wife  send  money  to  her  mother  (SOR  1.e)  to
help  pay  monthly  bills.  They  send  money  to  help  her  father  (SOR  1.e)  fix  his  farm
machines. (Item 5 at 7-8, 10)

23-year-old  brother  nor  his  19-year-old  brother  have  ever  worked.  The  34-year-old

parents, living with Applicant as permanent residents of the U.S. since September 2017,
did  not  want  to  own  the  Kenyan  home  because  of  potential  inheritance  issues  with
Applicant’s siblings on their death. Applicant, his parents, and his children use the home

visiting relatives. (Item 5 at 9; item 6 at 12; December 2018 answer to SOR)

provides  specific  amounts  of  money  to  them  to  pay  for  their  food,  rent,  medical  bills,
schooling, and emergencies. (Item 5 at 11-12; Item 6 at 10-12; December 2018 answer

interview in November 2017 that he never served in a foreign military service. He never

2017 to visit them.
Administrative Notice - Kenya
The  Kenyan  republic  has  three  branches  of  government:  (1)  a  directly  elected
president; (2) a two-tier legislature consisting of a Senate and a National Assembly; and
(3) a  judiciary.  The  United  States  and  Kenya  have  been  partners in  the  global war on
terrorism.
The  U.S.  State  Department  advises  extreme  caution  when  traveling  throughout
Kenya  because  of  crime  and  terrorism.  Terrorist  acts  could  occur  by  assault,  suicide
operations, bomb and  grenade attacks,  or kidnappings.  On  March  29, 2018, the  State
Department provided an advisory not to travel in the Kenya-Somalia border region due
to  acts  of  terrorism  committed  by  the  al-Shabaab  terrorist  faction.  There  were  23
terrorist  attacks  in  the  country  in  2017,  resulting  in  80  fatalities.  The  U.S.  government
receives  ongoing  information  about  terrorism  threats  directed  at  U.S.,  Western,  and
Kenyan entities.
Human  rights  problems  continue  to  plague  Kenya.  These  issues  manifest
themselves  in  unlawful  and  politically  motivated  killings,  disappearances  occurring
under  force,  torture,  life-threatening  prison  conditions,  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention,
restrictions on freedom of the press and assembly, and violence against women.
