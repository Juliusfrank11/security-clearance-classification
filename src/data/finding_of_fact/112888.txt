The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant filed for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy
in approximately March 1997 that was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October
2000 and then discharged in March 2001 (SOR ¶ 1.a); that she filed in December 2007 for
a Chapter 13 bankruptcy that was voluntarily dismissed in February 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.b); and
that she filed for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2011 that was discharged in June
2011  (SOR  ¶  1.c). Additionally, as of the issuance of the SOR on November 9, 2018,
Applicant allegedly owed delinquent medical debt totaling $18,463 on nine accounts (SOR
¶¶ 1.d-1.l). (Item 1.) When she responded to the SOR allegations, Applicant admitted the
bankruptcies and debts. She explained that she had been unaware of the medical debts
before her interview; that she had recently paid off medical bills from her spouse’s bypass
surgery; and that she would work on paying off the SOR debts once she returns to work.
(Item 4.)
After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant’s Answer to the SOR (Item 4),
and AE A, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  57-year-old  high  school  graduate.  She  was  twice  married  and
divorced before marrying her current spouse in May 2004. She has three daughters, a son,
and a stepdaughter, who are now all adults. Applicant worked as a dispatcher for a county
sheriff before entering the defense industry in September 2004. Applicant then worked as a
secretary for a federal contractor for 9.5 years. When her then employer lost the contract in
April 2014, she was hired by the new contractor. She was still employed full time when she
took a second job, 39 hours per week, in March 2018. She worked alternating schedules
for the two companies until June 2018, when she resigned from her full-time job. In August
2018, her part-time employer took her on as a full-time employee. (Items 5, 10.)
Applicant’s first marriage lasted ten years. In June 1990, she married her second
husband.  Together  they  purchased  a  new  home  with  the  intention  of  renting  out  their
previous residence. The file does not contain any information about when they acquired
their new home or about the mortgages on the two homes. According to Applicant, their
tenant did not pay rent for almost a year. The same day that they had their tenant served
with an eviction notice, the house caught fire. For almost two years, they had to pay the
mortgage on the property while getting it repaired to re-rent it. Having to pay two mortgages
placed Applicant and her then spouse in a financial bind. (Item 4.) In late March 1997, they
filed a joint Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. A Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan was confirmed in
July 1997 and then modified before they voluntarily converted to a no-asset Chapter 7 filing
in October 2000 for reasons not clear in the evidentiary record. In early March 2001, they
were granted an automatic discharge in bankruptcy, and their case was closed in late April
2001 (Item 6),1  shortly after their divorce in March 2001. (Item 5.)
Three years into her current marriage, Applicant and her spouse filed a Chapter 13
bankruptcy  petition  in  December  2007,  after  completing  required  credit  counseling.
Applicant indicated in response to the SOR that they were both “left in financial trouble by
[their] previous marriages,” although bankruptcy docket information shows that Applicant’s
debt was discharged shortly before her divorce. Perhaps she reaffirmed debts, but it is
unclear. She had previously explained in August 2018 that she had filed for bankruptcy
because she had a car loan, a personal loan for a motorcycle, and a credit card debt with a
jeweler that she could not repay. (Items 4, 7, 10.) In February 2008, their Chapter 13 plan
was  confirmed,  and  they  completed  a  post-petition  financial  management  course.  An
amended plan was confirmed in July 2009. In January 2011, Applicant and her spouse
filed for a voluntary dismissal of their Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Their Chapter 13 bankruptcy
was dismissed in February 2011 (Item 7), and they filed a no-asset Chapter 7 voluntary
petition.2  In April 2011, the bankruptcy trustee filed a report of no distribution. In June
2011, they were granted an automatic discharge under Chapter 7. (Item 8.) The amount of
debt discharged is not in the record. Applicant and her spouse converted their bankruptcy
to a Chapter 7 in part because they had unexpected expenses after taking full custody of
her two-year-old granddaughter.3 (Items 4, 10.)
On  April  24,  2018,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  for  a  clearance  for  her  current
employer. In response to financial delinquencies involving enforcement, Applicant listed
$800 in medical bills for bypass surgery for her spouse. She indicated that she was paying
the consolidated balance at $200 a month and that it should be paid off in a few months.
(Item 5.)
1 The file does not contain their bankruptcy petition, so the nature and amount of debt discharged is unclear.
Item 6 includes only the court docket information, which reflects the conversion from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7
and the discharge.
2  Applicant  indicated  in  response  to  the  SOR  that  she  and  her  spouse  filed  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in
December 2007, which they converted to a Chapter 13 in 2011. (Item 4.) Docket records indicate conversely
that they had the Chapter 13 dismissed and then filed a Chapter 7 no-asset bankruptcy. (Items 7-8.)
3 During her subject interview in August 2018, Applicant attributed the bankruptcy conversion in part to medical
issues for her spouse, who had bypass surgery. The medical debts in the SOR were placed for collection
between November 2012 and September 2017. Applicant has been repaying other medical debts in collection
that were incurred between October 2013 and July 2018. (AE A.) It is unclear to what extent, if any, her
spouse’s medical issues were a factor in the bankruptcy filing in 2007, or in its conversion in 2011.
As of June 13, 2018, Applicant had no delinquent consumer loans or credit cards on
her credit record. She had a department store credit card with a balance of $1,928 and a
joint home-furnishings charge card with a balance of $2,159. Payments on those accounts
were timely. A $21,776 car loan had been paid off in January 2015. Some medical debts
had been or were still in collection. A $146 medical debt placed in March 2012 was paid in
September 2012. A $353 medical debt placed in November 2012 was paid in April 2013.
Medical  debts  of  $44  and  $40  placed  in  November  2014  were  paid  in  October  2017.
However, she still owed $18,463 in past-due medical debt: $9,532 in collection since June
2013 (SOR ¶ 1.d); $50 in collection since June 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.e); $50 in collection since
September 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.f ); $4,947 in collection since December 2015 (SOR ¶ 1. g); $91
in collection since November 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.h); $126 in collection since April 2015 (SOR ¶
1.i ); $817 in collection since September 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.j); and $1,330 (SOR ¶ 1.k) and
$1,520 (SOR ¶ 1.l) in collection since February 2015. (Item 9.)
On August 21, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) about her financial record. She discussed her
2011 Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing, which she had previously not disclosed because it was
filed over seven years prior to her SF 86. She attributed the filing to being unable to pay
several  accounts  because  of  her  spouse’s  medical  issues  and  having  had  to  obtain
custody of her granddaughter. She could not recall the amount of her and her spouse’s
listed  liabilities  or  assets  but  indicated  that  all  listed  debt  had  been  discharged.  She
maintained that her financial situation has been stable since then, except for medical bills
incurred for her spouse’s surgery. About her previously disclosed medical delinquency,
Applicant  related  that  she  and  her  spouse  were  liable  for  about  $3,200  in  medical
expenses for his surgery. She indicated that she has been making payments of $200 a
month  to  a  receivables  company  since  September  2017  to  resolve  the  debts.  When
confronted about the outstanding medical collection debts on her credit record, Applicant
stated that the accounts were being paid together through one payment of $200 a month.
(Item 10.)
On November 9, 2018, the DOD CAF issued the SOR to Applicant because of her
history of bankruptcies and the unpaid medical collection debts on her June 2018 credit
report.  (Item  1.)  When  she  responded  to  the  SOR  on  December  4,  2018,  Applicant
indicated that she had not known about the SOR debts before her interview. She explained
that the largest medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.d for $9,532 had never been submitted to her
medical insurer. She indicated that she had just finished her payments to the receivables
company for other medical debts, and that she would work on resolving the SOR debts
once she is able to return to work. (Item 4.) She provided no information at that time about
the  reasons  for,  or  the  duration  of,  her  absence  from  work,  or  of  its  impact  on  her
household finances.
In rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant submitted documentation from the receivables
company showing that she fully resolved $888 in medical debt incurred on her account
between October 2013 and July 2018.4 Applicant explained that her spouse had his own
4 The records of the receivables company show transactions in various amounts between September 27,
2017, and October 12, 2018. They appear to represent the dates of disbursements to the creditors rather than
medical bills for his bypass surgery that they were repaying. Regarding the SOR debts, she
asserted she was presently unable to make any repayment arrangements because she
has been out of work since before Thanksgiving in November 2018. It appears that the
security clearance process was a factor in that she stated, “As this process is becoming
long term it’s also causing more of a financial burden.” (AE A.) She attributed her history of
financial delinquencies to “several devastating life events that [she] had no control over,”
although she did not elaborate about those events. (AE A.)
