Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR,  with  explanations.  His
admissions are incorporated into these findings.
Applicant is 59 years old and single. He has a bachelor’s degree that he earned in
1983. He has worked for federal contractors since the 1980s and held security clearances
during some of that time. He has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor,
for the past 11 months. Prior to this position, he worked for a different federal contractor
for a year and a half. He had been unemployed for a year and a half before he found that
position.  He  said  that  since  September  11,  2001,  he  experienced  several  periods  of
unemployment that  contributed  to  his financial  difficulties.  For example,  since  2010 he
has been unemployed four to five times. In 2011, 2012, and 2015, he was unemployed
for eight months each year because he could not secure a federal contract. (Tr. 26-31,
35-36)
In October 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) for
re-investigation and renewal. In December 2017, a government investigator interviewed
him about matters in his 2016 SCA, including delinquent debts and student loans. (GE 1,
GE 2)
Applicant testified that in 1994 he lost his security clearance for having delinquent
debts and student loans. He thinks he owed about $30,000 in student loans at the time.
After entering into a rehabilitation plan and bringing the student loans into a current status,
his security clearance was reinstated in 1998. He said he originally took out about $40,000
to  $50,000  in  student  loans  to  obtain  his  bachelor’s  degree  in  the  early  1980s.  He
acknowledged that his current delinquent student loan balance includes some of those
unpaid  loans.  He  said  he  has  been  unable  to  pay  them  because  he  has  experienced
periods of unemployment over the years. (Tr. 58-60, 66-69)
Applicant’s  annual  salary  is  about  $100,000,  which  is  approximately  the  same
amount  he  has  received on  most  contracts  throughout  the past few  years.  He  said  he
generally  spends  between  three and  six  months  locating a new  work  contract after  he
completes  one.  (Tr.  32,  37)  His  net  monthly  income  is  about  $7,000,  and  his  monthly
expenses are between $4,000 and $5,000. He has some money in a 401(k) retirement
account, but does not have a savings account. He consulted a financial counselor twice
in the last six to eight months. He is working on a budget with the counselor. (Tr. 61, 69-
72)
Based on credit bureau reports (CBRs) from July and August 2017, and August
2018, the SOR alleged nine debts that became delinquent between 2013 and 2017, and
totaled $33,745. Applicant repeatedly stated that he was unaware of the debts until he
received the SOR. (Tr. 55; GE 2, 3, and 5) The status of each debt is as follows:
1.  (1.a) In October 2016, Applicant submitted a SCA. Prior to that, he had stopped
paying  his  student  loan  debt  for  two  or  three  years.  In  December  2017,  he
initiated a loan-rehabilitation process and started making nominal payments of
$5 a month for nine months. In September 2018, he completed that process
and  began  making  monthly  payments  of  $150.  The  SOR  listed  the  debt  as
$15,717; however, according to AE A, the total amount is $19,925, and includes
two loans. Although he is now paying them again, he has not made sufficient
progress  on  reducing  the  debt,  given  the  number  of  years  he  has  failed  to
address them. They are unresolved.(Tr. 37-44; GE 6; AE A)
2.  (1.b)  The  $14,926  unpaid  debt  owed  to  an  apartment  complex  became
delinquent in 2013. It was settled for $5,224 and paid in November 2018. It is
resolved. (Tr. 49; Answer: Ex. B)
3.  (1.c) The $854 debt owed to a credit card company became delinquent in 2013
and was paid in 2018. It is resolved. (Tr. 52; Answer: Ex. C)
4.  (1.d) The $380 debt owed to a credit card company became delinquent in 2013
and was paid in November 2018. It is resolved. (Tr. 50; Answer Ex. D)
5.  (1.e) The $295 debt owed to a credit card company became delinquent in 2013
and was paid in November 2018. It is resolved. (Tr. 53; Answer: Ex. E)

7.  (1.g) The $675 debt owed to a credit union was paid in November 2018. It had
been owed for five or six years. It is resolved. (Tr. 54; Answer: Ex. G)
8.  (1.h) The $637 debt owed to a cable company was paid in January 2018. It is
resolved. (Answer: Ex. H)
9.  (1.i) The $167 debt owed to a cable company was paid in January 2018, along
with the debt listed in No. 8, above. It is resolved. (Tr. 56; Answer: Ex. H)

a credit score of 741. (AE A)
