In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted he was aware of the account that
charged  off  $26,191  following  the  voluntary  repossession  of  his  vehicle.  He  admitted
being charged with Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), and admitted that he drank a lot after
he left the military, but denied admitting during a 2015 substance abuse evaluation that
he had a drinking problem, and denied the marijuana allegations. After a thorough review
of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  49-year-old  technical  support  associate  who  has  worked  for  a
defense contractor since June 2005 and seeks to retain a security clearance. In 2013, he
was granted a secret security clearance. (Ex. 3, Tr. 62) He was also granted a security
clearance in the 1990s. (Ex. 4) He is married, and has three children ages 25, 21, and
17.  (Tr.  12)  His  son  is  in  high  school  and  still  lives  with  him.  (Tr.  63)  His  wife  has  a
cosmetology job. (Ex. 3, Tr. 25) Her income is not part of the record. His annual income
is $55,000, plus overtime. (Tr. 63)
From July 1989 through July 1993, Applicant honorably served on active duty with
the U.S. Army. He left the Army as an E-4. (Ex. 1) He served in Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,
and  Bahrain.  (Tr.  32)  From  October  1990  to  April  1991,  he  was  deployed  for  seven
months in support of Operation Desert Storm. (Ex. 2) Desert Storm started on August 2,
1990 and ended February 28, 1991. He was also deployed to Kuwait for three and a half
months from May 2002 through August 2002 in the Liberation of Kuwait campaign. (Ex.
1, Ex. 2) His unit deployed again, but he did not go since the deployment started three
days  after his expiration  term  of  service  (ETS) date.  (Tr. 34)  In  2008  or 2009,  he  was
diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSD). (Ex. 3, Ex. 5) He says
he went to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for help, but stopped going to
the VA a few years ago. (Tr. 52) He does not receive any VA disability compensation. (Tr.
80)
When  Applicant  completed  his  March  2017  Electronic  Questionnaires  for
Investigation Processing (e-QIP), he indicated he had two delinquent obligations of $428
and $103. He also listed a delinquent $1,800 student loan and stated he was currently in
the  process  of  establishing  a  monthly  $250  automatic  draft  to  pay  the  student  loan
obligation. (Ex. 1)
In  Applicant’s  January  2018  Enhanced  Subject  Interview,  he  stated  he  drank
heavily after work every other day and on most weekends while on active duty until 1993.
(Ex.  3) He  indicated  his consumption of  alcohol increased after his  deployment during
Desert Storm as he would drink to escape the feeling that being in active combat invoked.
(Ex. 3) After leaving the Army, he would drink three or four beers and a couple of shots
of  hard  liquor  two  times  a  week.  In  2004/2005,  he  stopped  drinking  beer  and  started
drinking red wine. (Ex. 3)
Applicant stated he first used marijuana in 1992, the night before his deployment
to Kuwait in hopes a positive urinalysis would prevent his deployment overseas. (Ex. 3,
Tr. 20) There was no urinalysis before his deployed. He did not smoke marijuana during
his deployment, but did some two or three times a year until 1997/1998. (Ex. 3) At the
hearing,  he  said  he  only  used  marijuana  one  time,  the  night  before  his  deployment  to
Kuwait. (Tr. 33) During the hearing he stated that after leaving the Army his marijuana
use “was pretty regularly, pretty regularly when I got out. It was, I wouldn’t say every day,
but it was a lot more than what I – my consumption when I was in the military.” (Tr. 34)
Applicant asserted he started using marijuana less after his children were born in
1993 and 1998. (Tr. 35) At the hearing he asserted his last use of marijuana was in the
late 1990s. (Tr. 36) In his January 2018 interview, he stated he had not used marijuana
since 1997/1998. (Ex. 3)
A November 2015 Substance Abuse Evaluation stated Applicant met the criteria
for alcohol abuse. (Tr. 4) In the alcohol/drug history portion of the evaluation it stated:
While in the Army on active duty he drank almost every day until drunk or
buzzed  in  order  to  forget.  In  his  mid-30s  he  drank  6  beers on  4  nights  a
week. In his 40s (since 2010) until his DWI arrest he drank 3-4 times a week,
usually 2-3 shots during the week and up to 4 shots on weekends. He mostly
stopped  drinking  beer 3  years ago.  In  the  past  5  years he  recalls  getting
drunk once a month and has experienced a few blackouts. He last drank in
September 2015.
He began smoking marijuana at 15 and said he quit in August of this year.
At the peak of his pot smoking he was smoking daily “in spurts.” In 2015 he
said he got high 10-20 times.
In the past year [Applicant] has noticed that he has been drinking too much
because of anger and frustration with his life. He said he drinks and smokes
to forget and to help him deal “with stuff.” (Ex. 4)
In  the  Patient’s  Report  section  of  the  evaluation,  it  states  Applicant  admits  to
having a drinking problem, but not a drug problem. (Ex. 4) The evaluation stated Applicant
was suffering from PTSD as a result of his military service in Desert Storm. He suffered
from flashbacks and nightmares, experienced depression, anxiety, and hyper-vigilance.
(Ex.  4)  In  response  to  the  evaluation  stating  that  Applicant  quit  smoking  marijuana  in
August 2015, he stated, “The truth is that I stated I have used marijuana before, and I
used to get high quite often when I first got out of the military, but I no longer use it.” (Ex.
4, Tr. 39) His response never specifically denied he stated he quit using marijuana as of
August 2015. A month after the evaluation, marijuana was found in the vehicle he was
driving. (Tr. 43)
In  September  2015,  Applicant  attended  a  family  party  over  the  Labor  Day
weekend. He arrived at the party at 5:00 p.m. and over the course of six or seven hours
consumed two or three shots of tequila and “a couple of beers.” Later at 1:42 a.m. when
stopped by the police his blood alcohol content (BAC) was above .15. (Ex. 3, Tr. 26)
When  the  party  ended,  Applicant  felt  his daughter  was  not  able  to  drive  herself
home, so he did. (Ex. 6) After dropping her at her home he continued onto his home. He
asserted he was attempting to roll up the passenger-side window when he ran into the
curb. He was stopped by the police. He refused a breathalyzer test and was taken into
custody and charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI) of alcohol. (Ex. 3) He said
that he had a couple of beers and a couple of mixed drinks at the family event. In a search
of the vehicle, a small bag of marijuana was found between the seats. He was charged
with possession of marijuana, but the charge was later dismissed. (Ex. 3)
Applicant paid his attorney $5,000. (Tr. 28) Applicant was found guilty of DUI with
a BAC greater than .15, fined $2,457, and required to complete 21 months of supervised
probation,  which  ended  in  July  2017.  (Ex.  4,  Ex.  6)  Following  the  completion  of  his
supervised  probation,  he  was  required  to  pay  a  $1,000  surcharge  each  year for  three
years to the Department of Public Safety. He was also required to complete 80 hours of
community  service,  which  he  did  at  an  animal  shelter.  (Tr.  29)  He  completed  the
community service in December 2015 and January 2016. (Ex. F)
Applicant  was  required  to  attend  a  Mothers  Against  Drunk  Driving  class  and
ordered to have  a  Substance  Abuse Evaluation.  (Ex.  3)  In October 2015,  he  attended
nine  Alcoholics  Anonymous  meetings.  (Ex.  D)  In  October  2015,  he  completed  a  court
required DWI Education Program. (Ex. F) He had a smart start interlock device installed
on his vehicle and was required to pay $75 monthly for the 21 months the device was on
his vehicle. (Ex. 3) Applicant believes the arrest cost him approximately $25,000. (Ex. 3)
He asserts he has reduced his alcohol consumption, but continues to consume alcohol
on weekends. (Tr. 35)
On January 5, 2016, Applicant’s son was suspended from school for three days
after  coming  to  basketball  practice  smelling  of  marijuana.  A  search  of  his  person
discovered  two  marijuana  buds.  (Ex.  A)  Applicant  believes  the  marijuana  discovered
during his DUI stop belonged to his son. (Ex. 3, Tr. 43) When asked, his son denied it
was his or that of his friends. (Tr. 31)
In Applicant’s July 25, 2018 response to written interrogatories, he says he was
last  intoxicated  in  July  2018,  the  month  he  completed  his  response.  (Ex.  4)  In  his
response, he stated he had been informed he met the criteria for alcohol abuse and was
recommended to complete counseling and continued with individual therapy. (Ex. 4)
From June 2018 through August 2018, Applicant had eight appointments with a
doctor  to  address  anxiety  and  PTSD.  (Ex.  B,  Ex.  5)  Applicant  attended  all  scheduled
sessions  and  successfully  achieved  all  of  his  goals.  (Ex.  B,  Ex.  5)  On  September  13,
2018, his doctor indicated Applicant’s prognosis was “Most favorable.” (Ex. B, Ex. 5)
Applicant  was  also approved for eight  sessions  of  counseling  or treatment  from
May 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019, through the Employee Assistance Program (EAP).
(Ex. C) It is noted that the period of treatment has not ended. No information was received
concerning the nature of the sessions or what benefit he has received from the sessions.
He currently takes medication for depression, PTSD, and anxiety. (Tr. 54)
In June 2010, Applicant and his wife purchased an automobile for approximately
$25,537 with $583 monthly payments. (Ex. 2, Ex. 7) His wife was to make the monthly
payments, but failed to do so in a timely manner. In June 2011,  $22,441 was past due
when they surrendered the car. (Ex. 6) In September 2009, following the repossession,
$15,149 was charged off on the vehicle. (Ex. 2) When asked about the debt during his
January 2018 subject interview, he agreed with the delinquent account, but was unsure
of the balance. (Ex. 3) His position on the delinquent debt was that since he no longer
had the vehicle he had no reason to pay the debt. (Ex. 3, Tr. 59)
At the time of the hearing, Applicant had done nothing to address the delinquent
obligation. (Tr. 61) He asserted that following the hearing, he would contact the creditor
and  take  care  of  the  debt.  (Tr.  62,  64)  No  information  or  documentation  concerning
discussions with the creditor or payment on the debt was received following the hearing.
During Applicant’s November 2013 subject interview, he indicated he was laid off
from his job for three months from January 2004 through March 2004, and his wife was
laid off from her job in early 2004. (Ex. 2) His mortgage became delinquent and the house
went  to foreclosure  in 2005  or 2006.  (Ex.  2) In  his  January  2018  subject  interview,  he
stated the vehicle repossession was due to his wife losing her job and he was recovering
from a layoff. However, the only evidence produced at the hearing indicates his wife lost
her job in 2004, and he was laid off in 2004. As listed on his September 2013 security
clearance  application,  his  only  period  of  unemployment  between  July  2000  and
September 2013 was during the first three months of 2004. The vehicle was purchased
six years later, in June 2010.
Applicant’s financial  issues may  have  been contributed to by  a  $400  per month
garnishment commenced in 1998. The garnishment was for child support for his daughter.
The child support ended in 2011, when his daughter graduated from high school. (Ex. 2)
