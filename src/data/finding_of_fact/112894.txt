In  her  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  most,  or  portions  thereof,  of  the
factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.d., and 1.f.); as
well  as  most,  or  portions  thereof,  of  the  factual  allegations  pertaining  to  alcohol
consumption  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a.  and  2.b.).  Applicant’s  admissions  and  accompanying
comments  are  incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  complete  and  thorough
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the
following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving
as  a  system  engineer  with  her  current  employer  since  January  2008.  She  received  a
bachelor’s degree in 2010. Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army in November 1996, and
served until April 2004, when she was honorably discharged. Applicant was granted a top
secret clearance with access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) in 1997, and
that clearance remained active until another U.S. Government agency denied Applicant’s
access to SCI in March 2017, following an initial decision in December 2016. (Item 2, at
31-33; Item 8, at 2; Item 10; Item 11) Applicant was married in late 2000, and divorced
three months later in 2001.She married again in 2004, and divorced in 2014. She has
been cohabiting since the summer of 2017. (Item 2, at 17-18; Item 7 (2017 Enhanced
Subject  Interview,  at  3);  Item  7  (2018  Enhanced  Subject  Interview,  at  4)  She  has  no
children.
Personal Conduct
Applicant  was  a  recreational  substance  abuser  whose  primary  substances  of
choice were marijuana, cocaine, and 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) – a
psychoactive drug commonly known as ecstasy. She also used Vicodin – a prescription
combination  of  an  opioid  pain  reliever,  hydrocodone,  and  a  non-opioid  pain  reliever,
acetaminophen, that was not prescribed for her.  In addition, although not alleged in the
SOR, prior to joining the U.S. Army in 1996, Applicant also experimented with a variety
of illegal substances, including those identified above. (Item 1, at 3; Item 8, at 2)
Applicant is not a reliable historian regarding her history of drug involvement and
substance misuse because of her inconsistent and frequently false statements in which
she  either  denied,  concealed,  or  omitted  significant  portions  of  her  history.  In  August
1997, she denied ever using any illegal drug when she was a teenager, and she explained
that, because her parents believed she was using drugs, they enrolled her in a treatment
facility  where  she  underwent  group  and  individual  counseling  for  two  and  one-half
months.  She stated that she omitted the information from her QNSP because she did not
feel it was pertinent to the U.S. Army to know. (Item 6; Item 3) In June 2003, she again
denied any use of illegal substances or drug activity. (Item 4) In January 2015, Applicant
again denied any past illegal use of drugs or drug activity. (Item 5) In April 2017, when
completing her e-QIP, she reported that she had used her husband’s Vicodin prescription
both “occasionally” and “a few times,” but denied any other past illegal use of drugs or
drug activity. (Item 2, at 29-31)
In  April  2016,  prior
to  undergoing  a  polygraph  examination,  Applicant
acknowledged  that,  from  2006  until  2008,  she  experimented  with  marijuana,  and  from
April 2009 until the beginning of 2013, she used her husband’s medical marijuana from a
vaporizer on no more than ten occasions. The marijuana relaxed her. (Item 8, at 2; Item
9, at 2) In August 2018, during an interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of
Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant initially denied using any controlled substance
within the last seven years (2011-2018). Upon being confronted with her pre-polygraph
statement, she denied the accuracy of that earlier statement and explained that she was
told by the examiner that she had to discuss possible dates of drug use so she expanded
her period of use. She claimed the correct period of use should have been from 2009 until
mid-2010, and that she only did so on five occasions, when she used a vape pipe four
times  and  one-half  of  a  “marijuana  sucker”  one  time  at  home.  (Item  7,  at  3-4;  Item  1
(Answer  to  the  SOR),  at  4)  In  her  2018  response  to  the  interrogatories,  Applicant
contended that her use of marijuana consisted of five times between 1996 and 2010, and
thereafter of less than 30 instances. (Item 7 (Response to Interrogatories), at 4)  Since
Applicant  was  granted  her  top  secret  clearance  with  SCI  access  in  1997,  her  use  of
marijuana occurred while she held her security clearance.
During  her  2016  pre-polygraph  examination,  Applicant  acknowledged  that,  from
April 2009 until October 2013, she used Vicodin on no more than 20 occasions, each time
taking no more than three pills by mouth. She did so because of the euphoric effect she
experienced and in an effort to get high. (Item 8, at 2; Item 9, at 2)  Her story changed
during her two OPM interviews. In 2017, she told the  investigator that her Vicodin use
occurred only between October 2011 and April 2012 when she was experiencing migraine
headaches. (Item 7 (2017), at 3) The story  changed again in 2018. She told the OPM
investigator that the correct dates of Vicodin use occurred between 2009 and mid-2010,
and  consisted  of  her taking  three  pills each time  on  only  ten occasions.  Vicodin  made
Applicant  feel  good.  (Item  7  (2018),  at  3)  Since  Applicant  was  granted  her  top  secret
clearance  with  SCI access  in  1997,  her use  of  Vicodin  without  a prescription  occurred
while she held her security clearance.
During her 2016 pre-polygraph examination, Applicant acknowledged that, before
joining the U.S. Army in 1996, as well as from about 2006 until about 2008, she “continued
to experiment” with ecstasy. (Item 8, at 2; Item 9, at 2) Her story changed during her 2018
OPM  interview,  when  she  avoided  discussing  any  pre-Army  use  of  ecstasy,  and
seemingly altered the previously acknowledged time period of 2006 to 2008 to “it could
have been sometime” during that period when she experimented with only one ecstasy
pill. (Item 7, at 5) In her 2018 response to the interrogatories, Applicant contended that
her use of ecstasy consisted of one time between 1996 and 2006, and thereafter only two
instances. (Item 7 (Response to Interrogatories), at 4) Since Applicant was granted her
top secret clearance with SCI access in 1997, her use of ecstasy occurred while she held
her security clearance.
During her 2016 pre-polygraph examination, Applicant acknowledged that, before
joining the U.S. Army in 1996, as well as from about 2006 until about 2008, she “continued
to experiment” with cocaine. (Item 8, at 2; Item 9, at 2) Her story changed during her 2018
OPM  interview,  when  she  avoided  discussing  any  pre-Army  use  of  cocaine,  and  she
acknowledged
in
approximately 2006 or 2007 when a friend furnished it to her. (Item 7 (2018) In her 2018
response to the interrogatories, Applicant contended that her use of cocaine consisted of
one time between 1996 and 2007, and thereafter only two instances. (Item 7 (Response
to Interrogatories), at 4) Since Applicant was granted her top secret clearance with SCI
access in 1997, her use of cocaine occurred while she held her security clearance.
“one-time”  experimentation  with  cocaine  occurred
that  her
Applicant acknowledged that she was aware of the policy involving drug use while
maintaining a security clearance. She justified her drug use by thinking it was not a big
deal and that it was similar to drinking alcohol. Moreover, using the drugs was fun, and
she was just enjoying herself (Item 9, at 2) She subsequently claimed that she altered her
thinking,  and,  as  of  2018,  she  understands  that  her  position  was  not  correct.  ((Item  7
(2018), at 5) As of her 2017 OPM interview, Applicant has no intent of using any illegal
drug in the future. (Item 7 (2017), at 4)
While  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  when  Applicant  submitted  her  1996  and  2015
QNSPs and her 2003 SCA, she denied any history of illegal use of drugs or drug activity.
She  also  had  to  be  prompted  and  confronted  to  be  candid  during  her  pre-polygraph
interview and her OPM interview.
Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the
DOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess
an  applicant's  credibility;  (b)  to  evaluate  an  applicant's  evidence  of  extenuation,
mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to  consider  whether  an  applicant  has
demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the
Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis
under Directive § 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing
ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3
(App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016)
(citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-
20327  at  4  (App.  Bd. Oct.  26, 2006)).  Applicant’s  unalleged  omissions,  concealments,
and  falsifications  regarding  her  history  of  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse
described above, will be considered only for the five purposes listed above.
On April 6, 2017, when Applicant completed her e-QIP, she responded to certain
questions pertaining to her illegal use of drugs or drug activity found in Section 23 – Illegal
Use of Drugs or Drug Activity. The most significant questions, and the ones alleged in the
SOR, were essentially as follows: In the last seven (7) years “have you illegally used any
drugs  or  controlled  substances?”;  “have  you  EVER  illegally  used  or  otherwise  been
involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance other
than previously listed?”; and “have you EVER had a security clearance eligibility/access
authorization denied, suspended, or revoked?”  Applicant answered “no” to each of the
questions. (Item 2, at 29-30) She omitted and concealed her admitted use of marijuana,
cocaine, and ecstasy, and only acknowledged her misuse of the prescription drug Vicodin
during the period October 2011 until April 2012. She also omitted that her application for
eligibility  for  a  top  secret  clearance  with  access  to  SCI  was  denied  by  another  U.S.
Government agency in March 2017, approximately one month before she submitted her
e-QIP.  She  certified  that  her  responses  to  those  questions  were  “true,  complete,  and
correct”  to  the  best  of  her  knowledge  and  belief,  but,  because  of  her  omissions  and
concealments, the responses to those questions were, in fact, false.
Alcohol Consumption
In addition to her extensive use of drugs, Applicant consumed alcohol to excess
over a multi-year period. From 1992, when she was 17 years old, until 1997, Applicant
consumed two to four 12-ounce beers in a one-to-two hour period, once a month while
socializing with friends. The quantity and frequency increased while Applicant was in the
U.S. Army, and she consumed three to five 12-ounce beers or average-sized glasses of
wine over a three-to-five hour period, twice a week, mainly on the weekends. From 2012
to the beginning of 2015, Applicant again altered her consumption habits by drinking two
to four beers or glasses of wine in a three-to-four hour period, while at home, four times
per week. Because she was dealing with personal issues, Applicant explained that she
was self-medicating with alcohol, and while she intended to consume only one alcoholic
drink, she usually ended up consuming two to four drinks. From the beginning of 2015,
and continuing until April 2016, Applicant consumed three to five beers or average-sized
glasses  of  wine  over  a  three-to-five  hour  period,  twice  a  week  while  socializing  with
friends. (Item 8, at 4; Item 9, at 2-3)
Applicant  contended  that  to  become  intoxicated,  she  needs  to  consume
approximately  three  to  five  alcoholic  beverages  during  a  two-to-three  hour  period.
Defining intoxication as having a blood-alcohol-content (BAC) of .08 or higher, Applicant
acknowledged  that  from  1992  until  the  beginning  of  2015,  she  became  intoxicated  75
percent  of  the  time  she  consumed  alcohol;  and  from  the  beginning  of  2015  until  April
2016, she became intoxicated 50 percent of the time.  During her pre-polygraph interview
of April 8, 2016, Applicant acknowledged that she was last intoxicated two days earlier
when she consumed, over a six-and-one-half hour period, three to four beers, one shot,
and part of a martini. While she took an Uber from the bar back to her friend’s house,
Applicant then drove herself approximately ten miles back to her own house. (Item 8, at
4; Item 9, at 3) Driving  while intoxicated was nothing new to Applicant, and  during the
2016  pre-polygraph  interview,  she  acknowledged  that  she  had  done  so  on  numerous
occasions  between  1992  and  2016.  (Item  8,  at  5;  Item  9,  at  3-4)  However,  during  her
2018 OPM interview, she stated that the only time she ever drove while intoxicated was
when she was arrested in 2007. (Item 7, at 3)
Applicant also acknowledged that she has experienced both short-term and long-
term blackouts after consuming alcohol. She agreed that alcohol has negatively impacted
her in several ways. Nevertheless, as of April 2016, she did not think that she needed
help  to  stop  consuming  alcohol  and  she  was  confident  that  she  could  make  positive
changes regarding her consumption of alcohol on her own. (Item 8, at 5; Item 9, at 4-5)
In 2018, Applicant acknowledged that drinking alcohol gave her a pleasant feeling, and
she did not feel that she has a problem with alcohol. Her future intention was to continue
her current usage or less of alcohol. (Item 7, at 3)
Applicant’s  relationship  with  alcohol  has  resulted  in  only  one  known  incident
involving police and court authorities. On April 3, 2007, Applicant was celebrating (dining,
drinking, and dancing) a birthday with a number of friends from about 6:00 p.m. until early
the following morning. She consumed two glasses of wine and five unspecified alcoholic
beverages. After the bar closed, she drove herself the ten miles from the bar to her military
facility where, at 1:55 a.m. on April 4, 2007, she was stopped at the front gate because
the military police officer detected the strong odor of alcohol coming from her. She was
administered a field sobriety test, which she failed, and she was  arrested and charged
with driving under the influence (DUI). Applicant was then administered a breathalyzer
test, and it registered a BAC of .141. (Item 12) During her 2016 pre-polygraph interview,
as well as during her 2018 OPM interview, Applicant minimized her BAC result by claiming
it registered .12. (Item 8, at 3; Item 9, at 2; Item 7, at 2) Applicant remained in jail over
night and was released. Before appearing in court on the charge, Applicant performed
community  service,  and  she  attended  unspecified  alcohol  courses  for  several  months.
Her charge was later reduced to driving while ability impaired (DWAI), a misdemeanor.
(Item 8, at 3; Item 9, at 2-3)
