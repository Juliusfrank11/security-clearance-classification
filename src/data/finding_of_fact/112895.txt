Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.c through 1.e, and 2.a. He denied
the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 2.b. After a thorough and careful review of the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 39 years old. He was born in Iraq and earned a college degree there
in 2003. He married his wife, an Iraqi citizen, in 2012. They have five young children. It is
unknown  where  his  eldest  child  was  born.  His  four  younger  children  were  born  in  the
United States. He is presently seeking employment with a federal contractor.1
Applicant worked for a U.S. contractor in Iraq from 2003 to 2006. In January 2010,
he was granted a special immigration visa and immigrated to the United States. In his
September 2017 Questionnaire for National Security Position (SF 86), he disclosed that
he lived in the United States from 2010 to April 2016. He traveled back and forth to Iraq
numerous times during this period. Applicant became a naturalized citizen of the United
States in April 2016 and obtained a U.S. passport the same month. He then moved back
to Iraq in April 2016. Applicant also disclosed that he still held an Iraqi passport (which
will  expire  in  2022)  that  he  intended  to  relinquish  to  his  employer  after  his
counterintelligence screening interview (CSI). He stated in his SF 86: “After gaining my
U.S.  citizen[ship]  in  May  2016,  I  have  no  use  for  the  passport  and  will  relinquish  to
[prospective  employer]  as  I  have  renounced  the  Iraqi  citizenship  at  the  Naturalization
1 Item 3; AE A.
Ceremony.”2 In February 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator.
Noted  in  the  report  was  Applicant’s  foreign  travel  and  date  stamps  in  both  his  U.S.
passport and Iraqi passport. His Iraqi passport has entrance to Iraq stamps on May 2016,
July 2016, February 2017; October 2017, and November 2017, subsequent to becoming
a U.S. citizen.3
Applicant returned to the United States for a week in September 2017, and again
in approximately October to November 2017, to process his wife and son’s immigration
paperwork and for an interview. He then returned to Iraq and lived there from November
2017 to February 2018.4
Applicant  disclosed  on  his  September  2017 SF  86  that his  wife  is  a  citizen  and
resident of Iraq. During Applicant’s February 2018 CSI interview, he told the interviewer
that  he  moved  back  to  Iraq  because  his  wife  and  son  wanted  to  because  the  cultural
changes were tough on them. He said he would move back to the U.S., but wanted to
give his wife some more time before making the move back. In his CSI documents, he
confirmed at that time that his wife was a citizen and resident of Iraq. Applicant indicated
in his November 2018 answer to the SOR that his wife is a permanent resident of the
United States, and that she resided in Iraq. He said his son was a U.S. citizen residing in
Iraq. Applicant said in his February 2019 FORM response that his wife was living in the
United States. It is unknown when she moved back, and what her intentions are regarding
remaining in the United States. Applicant did not provide information as to when his wife
became a permanent resident and when his son became a U.S. citizen. He did not provide
corroborating documents as to their status.5
Applicant’s mother and two brothers are citizens and residents of Iraq. In his CSI
documents, he disclosed his mother is a homemaker. One brother is an assistant teacher
and the other is self-employed and has a cosmetic store.6
Applicant disclosed during his February 2018 background interview that his family
in Iraq is very wealthy, and he receives approximately $20,000 every two to six months
for  living  expenses.  He  has  received  money  transfers  since  2012  when  he  married.
Applicant has a saving and checking account with a U.S. bank that has a balance of about
$5,500.  He  also  has  an  Iraqi  bank  account  that he uses to  transfer  money  to  his  U.S.
accounts.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  had  transferred  $10,000  from  his  Iraqi  bank
account to his U.S. account when he was in Iraq. The funds were from rent payments
from the various rental properties he owns.7
2 Item 3. It is noted that Applicant said he became a U.S. citizen in May 2016, which differs from the date
he disclosed on his SF 86.
3 Items 3, 4, 5.
4 Items 4, 5.
6 Items 3, 4, 5.
7 Item 4.
Applicant disclosed that he owns a residence in Iraq where his immediate family
resides, and it is paid for in full. He purchased it in 2013 for his family and intended on
keeping it for when he visits Iraq. When interviewed for his CSI, he estimated its value at
$120,000.  In  his  SOR  answer,  he  indicated  that  its  value  depends  on  the  real  estate
market, so it could be valued less.8
Applicant co-owns with his mother and brothers a commercial property that has 10
apartment units. The apartments are rented, and he receives approximately $800 a month
in revenue. He referred to this as residual income. He estimated the property is valued at
approximately  $500,000.  He  inherited  the  property  when  his  father  passed  away  in
January 2018.9
Applicant co-owns with his mother and brothers a three-building compound. His
mother and brothers live in one residence, and they rent the other two residences. They
receive  rental  income  of  approximately  $1,800  monthly.  The  compound  is  valued  at
approximately $2,500,000.10
Applicant disclosed that from 2007 to 2009, he was employed full time by an Iraqi
company. He told the government investigator that he was still employed by the same
employer, and he provides services at least once a quarter or as needed. He provided
his services both electronically and in person. He completes about five to six tasks for the
company per year and receives approximately $25,000 in cash compensation annually.11
Applicant disclosed that he was employed by a consulting company in Iraq from
April 2016 to the present on a part-time basis. He is compensated about $2,000 a month
for his services. He worked from April 2016 to August 2017 for the company while in Iraq.
From  August  2017  until  at  least  the  date  of  his  interview  in  February  2018,  he  was
employed by the company and provided services electronically and in-person. Applicant
disclosed that while living in the U.S., he was self-employed from January 2010 to April
2016.  He  had  various  commercial  jobs  and  a  business  where  he  purchased  and  sold
furniture. He completed these duties from home. He did not have a license or pay taxes
for his jobs in the U.S. He was paid in cash.12
8 Items 4, 5.
9 Items 4, 5.
10 Items 3, 4, 5. Applicant did not disclose any foreign financial or real estate interests in his SF 86. I have
not considered any derogatory information that was not alleged for disqualifying conditions. I may consider
it  when  making  a  credibility  determination,  in  the  application  of  mitigating  conditions,  and  in  my  whole-
person analysis.
11 Items 4, 5.
12 Items 3, 4, 5.
Applicant also told the government investigator that he was unemployed from April
2012  to  April  2016.13  He  filed  past  federal  income  tax  returns  in  2015  and  learned  he
owed $20,000 in federal taxes. In his SOR answer, he admitted he failed to timely file his
2011,  2012,  2013,  and  2014  federal  income  tax  returns.  He  said  he  made  payment
arrangements with the IRS and had an installment agreement to pay $230 a month. He
was questioned as to why with his financial resources he did not pay the whole amount
owed. He told the investigator he preferred the settlement agreement.14
In his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  stated  that  the  $16,000 federal  income  tax
debt was reduced to $9,396. He provided copies of IRS transcripts from November 2018.
They confirm that he filed his 2014 federal income tax return in April 2015.15 He provided
a transcript for tax year 2010, which is not alleged.16 He also provided 2011 and 2012
transcripts that show he filed these tax year returns in August 2015. As of the date of the
transcripts, the balances owed were $420 for 2010; $4,589 for 2011, and $4,846 for 2012.
Applicant  did  not  provide  a  tax  transcript  for  2013.  The  transcripts  also  reflect  that
Applicant  entered  into  an  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS  in  2015,  and  he  made
inconsistent payments through 2018. His 2014 transcript reflects some payments were
redirect to his 2010 tax liability. The transcripts also reflect that tax years 2011 and 2012
were no longer in an installment agreement.17
In  his  FORM  response,  Applicant  provided  a  document  from  the  IRS  from
December  2018.  It  stated  that  the  IRS  had  accepted  an  installment  agreement  from
Applicant to pay $230 monthly. It reflected it included tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, and
2014. Also provided was proof of a payment made to the IRS in December 2018 for $230.
Applicant stated in his response that his tax-debt balance was now approximately $2,739
because he was owed a refund of $6,090 for tax year 2018 that was applied to his tax
balance.  Applicant  did  not  provide  corroborating  documents  to  show  his  current  tax
balance.18
IRAQ
The United States Department of State warns that U.S. citizens in Iraq remain at
high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence and to avoid all travel to Iraq. The ability of
the  U.S.  Embassy  to  provide  consular  services  to  U.S.  citizens  outside  Baghdad  is
13 Item 4. It is noted that Applicant’s statements to the investigator about his employment are inconsistent.
14 Items 4, 5.
15 It is alleged that Applicant’s 2014 federal tax returns were filed untimely. The IRS documents provided
show the 2014 return was filed timely.
16  Item  4.  Applicant’s  2010  federal  income  tax  return  was  filed  in  July  2015.  I  will  not  consider  this  for
disqualifying purposes as noted above because it was not alleged.
17 Item 2.
18 Item 4; AE A, D, E, F.
extremely  limited  given  the  security  environment.  The  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Syria
(ISIS) controls a significant portion of Iraq’s territory. Within areas under ISIS control, the
Iraqi government has little or no ability to control and ensure public safety.
Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such
groups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias
may  also  threaten  U.S.  citizens  and  western  companies  throughout  Iraq.  U.S.
Government and western interests remain possible targets for attacks.
The  U.S.  Government  considers  the  potential  personal  security  threats  to  U.S.
government personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to live and work under
strict security guidelines.
There are significant human rights problems in Iraq to include: sectarian hostility,
widespread corruption, lack of transparency at all levels of government and society that
have  weakened  the  government’s  authority  and  worsened  effective  human  rights
protections.  Iraqi  security  forces  and  members  of  the  Federal  Police  have  committed
human rights violations to include killing, kidnapping, and extorting civilians. ISIS is also
responsible for human rights abuses. There are also problems that include harsh and life-
threatening  conditions  in  detention  and  prison  facilities,  arbitrary  arrest  and  lengthy
pretrial detainment, denial of fair public trial, limits on freedom of expression, freedom of
the  press,  censorship  of  religion,  limits  on  peaceful  assembly,  and  societal  abuses  of
women.
