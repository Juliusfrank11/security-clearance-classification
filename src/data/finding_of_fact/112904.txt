Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.j. 1.k, and 1.l. He
denied the allegations SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i, and stated he paid these debts.
His admissions are incorporated into these findings.
Applicant  is  25  years  old.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  2012.  He  has  two
children, ages three and four, with a former girlfriend. They live in another state. Since
October 2017, he has lived with his fiancée, who is pregnant with their child. (Tr. 22-23,
25-26)
After  graduating  from  high  school,  Applicant  went  to  work  for  local  retail
companies. In May 2013, he began a position with a private company. He worked there
until April 2015, when he voluntarily resigned his position after a dispute with his employer
and moved to another state to be with his two children.  He obtained another job in the
new  state  at  a  lesser  salary  and  worked  there  until  July  2016,  when  he  was  in  an
automobile  accident.  He  was  unable  to  return  to  work  until  September  2017.  He  then
moved back to his former state and worked as a private driver. In April 2018, he started
a position with a federal contractor. He has also attended technical school. (Tr. 23-25; GE
1)
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  problems  to    the  following:  factors:  quitting  his
position in April 2015; moving to another state; being unable to find a good paying job
there; and  the long period of unemployment he experienced after his automobile accident
in July 2016. (Tr. 26) He admitted that he exercised poor judgment when he resigned his
position and moved to another state where his children lived, without having another job.
(Tr. 60)
Based on a credit bureau report (CBR) from April 2018, the SOR alleged 12 debts
that became delinquent between 2014 and 2017, and totaled $29,554. The status of each
debt is as follows:
1.  (1.a) The $14,314 charged-off automobile loan is unresolved. The last payment
Applicant made on the car loan was in March 2015, a month before he resigned
his job. He said he voluntarily returned the car. The original loan was more than
$20,000.  He  explained  that  he  is  paying  collection  debts  before  resolving
charged-off accounts. (Tr. 34-36)
2.  (1.b) The $130 debt owed to an insurance company for car insurance was paid
in April 2018. It is resolved. (Tr. 36; AE A at 7)
3.  (1.c) The $599 debt owed to a cable company was paid in August 2018. It is
resolved. (Tr. 37; AE A at 7)
4.  (1.d)  The  $662  debt  owed  to  a  retail  store  is  unresolved.  The  account  was
closed in June 2015. Applicant more recently called the creditor to settle the
account for a lesser amount but was unsuccessful. The creditor wants the full
amount. It is unresolved. (Tr. 38)
5.  (1.e) The $660 debt owed to a wireless company was paid in March 2019. It is
resolved. Applicant used some of his $1,200 tax refund from 2018 to pay this
debt. (Tr. 39; AE B)
6.  (1.f)  The  $4,088  debt  owed  to  a  creditor  for  an  unpaid  loan  is  unresolved.
Applicant stopped paying the debt in March 2015. He had been paying it for
about a year. The creditor will not take payments on the debt or settle it for less
than $4,088. (Tr. 40-42)
7.  (1.g)  The  medical  debt  for  $222  was  paid  by  Applicant’s  lawyer  after  his
automobile accident in 2016. It is resolved. (Tr. 42; AE H)
8.  (I.h)  The  medical  debt  for  $399  was  paid  by  Applicant’s  lawyer  after  his
automobile accident in 2016. It is resolved. (Tr. 43; AE G)
9.  (1.i) The medical debt for $125 is paid. (Tr. 44-45; AE C)
10. (1.j) The $1,115 debt owed to a credit card company is unpaid. Applicant’s last
payment was in March 2015. (Tr. 45-46)
11. (1.k)  The  $3,452  debt  owed  to  a  creditor  for  a  personal  loan  is  unresolved.
Applicant  obtained  the  loan  to  pay  off  debts  in  February  2015.  He  made
payments on the loan until May 2015. The creditor recently agreed to settle it
for $1,200, but he cannot afford that amount currently. (Tr. 46-49)
12. (1.l)  Applicant  owes  his  former  employer  $3,788  for  personal  expenses  he
charged to his employer’s credit card while traveling for his job. It also includes
about $1,200 for tools and materials he  purchased to use for his employer’s
project  from  October  to  December  2014.  He  said  his  supervisor  gave  him
authorization to use the credit card to purchase the tools he needed. He said
he had routinely put personal expenses on the credit card and paid them when
payment  was  due.  He  knew  he  was  not  supposed  to use  the  travel card for
personal expenses, but he had done so in the past without a problem because
he  promptly  paid  his  personal  expenses  when  he  received  the  credit  card
statement. He acknowledged that  some of the personal expenses he put on
the card were to purchase alcohol in a bar. He received reimbursement for the
authorized expenses on the card, but not for the tools or his personal expenses.
He quit this job in April 2015, as noted above, without having paid the credit
card debt. (Tr. 50-58, 77-78; AE D)
The  credit  card  balance  is  now  $4,039.  Applicant  began  making  monthly
payments  of  $289  in  February  2019.  He  intends  to  have  the  debt  paid  in
December 2020. The debt is slowly being resolved. (AE D)
Applicant earns $53,000 annually. He pays $500 a month in child support for his
two children. He uses an online app to keep track of his income and expenses. He does
not owe federal or state taxes. He has been making monthly payments of $90 on a $632
delinquent  loan  debt  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  He  has  not  taken  a  budget  or  credit
counseling  course,  but  has  had  help  from  his  mother,  who  teaches  budgeting  and
financial planning at a university. (Tr. 29-30, 32-34, 73-74; AE F)
Applicant submitted a letter of recommendation from his supervisor, who strongly
supports Applicant’s request for a security clearance. He relies on Applicant when he is
out of the office. He said Applicant is a “trustworthy individual.” (AE C)
