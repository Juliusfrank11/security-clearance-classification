Under Guideline F, the Government alleged Applicant owed the IRS $13,500 for
unpaid taxes from the 2012 and 2017 tax years (SOR 1.a); that he failed to timely file his
federal income tax returns for the tax years 2012 through 2017 (SOR 1.b); and his state
income tax returns for the tax years 2016 and 2017 (SOR 1.d). It was further alleged that
Applicant owed $1,314.66 for past-due state income taxes for the 2014 tax year pursuant
to  a  tax  lien  filed  against  him  in  April  2018  (SOR  1.c);  that  he  owed  $12,963  for  six
delinquent or past-due commercial debts (SOR 1.e – 1.j); and that on August 29, 2018,
he  filed  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  protection  through  a  petition  that  was  still  pending
approval as of the issuance of the SOR (SOR 1.k).
In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with explanations, the SOR 1.a – 1.j
allegations. As to SOR 1.k, Applicant denied the allegation, averring that the Chapter 13
petition  was  confirmed  on  November  9,  2018  and  that  he  was  making  payments  as
required  under  the  trustee’s  plan.  (Answer)  In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by
Applicant’s admissions, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 46 years old. After he graduated from high school in June 1991, he
joined the U.S. Navy where he served as a machinist’s mate until receiving an honorable
discharge in June 1997. He is seeking to renew a security clearance he received in 2011.
When he submitted his e-QIP in December 2017, he disclosed the fact that he had not
timely filed his federal income tax returns for 2012 through 2016; that he had not yet filed
his 2016 state income tax returns; and that he owed the debts alleged at SOR 1.e – 1.i.
(GX 1; Tr. 6, 74)
Applicant was married from June 1993 until divorcing in October 2008. He has six
children, some with his ex-wife and some outside the marriage, ranging in age from 5 to
28.  Applicant  is  paying  child  support  only  for  his  youngest  child.  Since  May  2002,
Applicant has lived with his mother, who has a variety of medical conditions. He helps

pay the rent and other expenses, and he is her primary care giver. (GX 1; Tr. 6 – 7, 15 –
16, 39 – 41, 65, 74 – 75)
Applicant has worked as a warehouse specialist for two different companies since
May  2006.  He  was  laid  off  in  July  2014  when  his  employer  lost  its  federal  contract.
Applicant resumed working in December 2014 and remained employed as a procurement
specialist until April 2017, when he again was laid off for one month after a lost contract.
Applicant has been steadily employed since May 2017. His average monthly income has
been $3,000. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 33 – 37)
Between  2013,  when  his  youngest  child  was  born,  and  2016,  Applicant  was
actively involved with the child’s mother in caring for and supporting the child. He often
took  the  child  to  and  from  daycare,  and  cared  for  the  child  where  the  mother  lived;
however, Applicant  has  only  seen  his child once  in  the  last  two-and-one-half  years.  In
2016, the child’s mother demanded financial support from Applicant. Applicant responded
by  requesting  a  DNA  test  to  verify  his  paternity.  That  request  meant  that  he  was  not
obligated to make payments pending the results, which were positive. Applicant became
obligated to make monthly child support payments beginning in March 2017, including an
arrearage that accrued while the DNA test was pending. Between 2016 and 2018, the
mother  of  Applicant’s  youngest  child  instituted  multiple  court  hearings  seeking
modification of Applicant’s child support payments. Between  2016 and 2018, Applicant
has had to appear in at least eight such hearings, and only recently was able to finalize a
child  support  requirement  of  $504  each  month.  The  payments  are  made  from  his  bi-
weekly paychecks at a rate of $232.61. (Answer; GX 2; GX 9; Tr. 45, 58 – 59, 77 – 78,
81 – 85)
For the tax years 2012 through 2015, the grandmother of the mother of Applicant’s
youngest child prepared and filed Applicant’s federal and state tax returns. After initially
receiving refunds for those years, Applicant was notified in 2017 that mistakes had been
made in those tax returns and that Applicant actually owed about $8,000. The amount
referenced in SOR 1.a is the result of interest and penalties. Applicant did not timely file
his 2016 federal income tax returns because he could not obtain his W-2 form from the
employer who laid him off in April 2017. He also delayed resolving his 2016 filing because
he was often involved in court hearings for child support. The same was true for his late
filing  of  his  2017  tax  returns  in  2018.  By  that  time,  Applicant  was  consulting  with  his
bankruptcy attorney who advised Applicant the attorney would file the return as part of
his bankruptcy services. All of Applicant’s past-due income tax returns have been filed.
(Answer; GX 2; GX 6; HX 9; Tr. 46 – 58, 78 – 80, 85 – 87)
Applicant incurred the debts addressed at SOR 1.e  – 1.j as a result of financial
challenges that began when he was laid off in 2014. Applicant has acknowledged that he
was not properly managing his finances at the time.  To resolve his federal income tax
debt,  Applicant entered  into a monthly  repayment plan  with  the  IRS  in  February  2018.
Applicant  agreed  to  pay  $146  each  month;  however,  before  he  could  start  making
payments, he was sidetracked by additional child support hearings. The same was true
as he tried to negotiate repayment of his other past-due debts directly with his creditors.
Until Applicant knew how much he had to pay in child support, he could not commit to
regular payments. After March 2018, Applicant knew how much he had to pay in child
support,  so  he  resumed  his  communications  with  his  creditors.  The  payments  they
demanded,  even  in  settlement,  exceeded  what  he  could  reasonably  pay  each  month.
Applicant  contacted  a  bankruptcy  attorney  in  July  2018  and  filed  for  Chapter  13
bankruptcy protection in August 2018 to resolve his debts. All of the debts alleged in the
SOR, including the state and federal income tax debts, are included in Applicant’s petition.
A repayment plan was approved in November 2018, and as of his hearing, Applicant had
made the first seven of his plan’s 60 payments. Applicant is resolving his child support
arrearage and his tax debts through $470 monthly payments under the bankruptcy plan.
His  bankruptcy  and  child  support  payments  are  paid  as  direct  allotments  from  his
paycheck. (Answer; GX 2; GX 6; AX A – C; Tr. 41 – 45, 79)
Appellant’s current finances are stable. After all of his monthly expenses, including
his  child  support  and  bankruptcy  payments,  he  has  a  positive  monthly  cash  flow.
Appellant has not incurred any new debts, and he has reduced his personal expenses
living with his mother and closely managing his money. When Appellant first applied for
a security clearance in 2009, he had other past-due debts that were addressed in that
background  investigation.  Applicant  resolved  those  debts  in  a  timely  manner.  His
personal  and  professional  circumstances  have  improved,  and  he  now  has  a  better
awareness of how to manage his personal finances. (Answer; GX 2; Tr. 60 – 61, 65 – 69,
70 – 73)
