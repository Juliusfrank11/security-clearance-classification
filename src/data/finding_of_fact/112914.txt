In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  48-year-old  test  engineer  employed  by  a  defense  contractor.  He
served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from  September  1989  to  September 1993.  He
enlisted in the Army National Guard in  June 1994. In March 1995, he reenlisted in the
U.S. Navy. He served on active duty until he retired from the Navy in May 2012 as a chief
warrant  officer.  He  held  a  security  clearance  in  the  Navy  and  retained  it  when  he  was
employed by a defense contractor.
Applicant married in June 1993, divorced in February 2013, and married his current
spouse in May 2014. He has five children from his first marriage, ages 26, 24, 17, 14, and
11. He has three stepchildren in his current marriage. He attended a technical institute
from September 2013 to September 2014, enrolled in a university in January 2015, and
completed the requirements for a bachelor’s degree in technical management in August
2019. (Tr. 21.)
Applicant was unemployed for about a month after retiring from the Navy. He was
employed in the food-processing industry from August 2012 to July 2013. In May 2013,
he was reprimanded and suspended for two days after using derogatory language about
a subordinate during a conversation with his supervisor. In June 2013, he was placed on
an “employee improvement program” after cross-contamination of food occurred during
an operation under his supervision. In July 2013, he quit his job because he was frustrated
with  the  work environment.  (GX  1  at  17.)  He  was  unemployed from  July  2013  to  April
2014, when he was hired by his current employer.
Applicant’s Navy career was stellar until September 2010. He progressed rapidly
through the ranks, received numerous awards and decorations, and was commissioned
as a warrant officer in 2009. He deployed on sea duty in May 2010, and he had been at
sea  for  about  four months  when  his  then  wife  told  him  that  she  wanted  a  divorce.  He
became  deeply  depressed  and  his  duty  performance  deteriorated  to  the  point  that  he
received two “letters of instruction” from his commanding officer and was detached for
cause from his assignment. Faced with a board of inquiry to determine whether he should
be separated from the Navy, he chose to retire. (AX A at 2.) He has a service-connected
disability due to sinusitis (10%) and a major depressive disorder (50%). (Tr. 20.)
Applicant’s then wife filed for divorce in 2011. The divorce was final in February
2013, and Applicant was ordered to pay child support for their five children in the amounts
of  $1,350  per  month  from  December  2012  to  January  2014;  $1,203  per  month  until
December  2019;  $960  per  month  until  April  2023,  and  $617  per  month  until  February
2026. (AX I.) He also was required to pay his ex-wife alimony of $1,000 per month, and
she was awarded 37.9 % of his military retired pay.
The SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling about $66,603, and failures to timely
file  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2015,  2016,  and  2017.  The
delinquent debts are reflected in credit reports from August 2018 and May 2017 (GX 4
and 5.)
On March 29, 2019, about two weeks after the SOR was issued, Applicant hired a
debt-management  company  and  enrolled  in  a  debt-management  plan  (DMP),  under
which  he  pays  the  debt-management  company  $195  per  week  to  manage  the  debts
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d, which he expects to resolve by 2023. (AX L at 4, 10,
15.)  Applicant  is  directly  responsible  for  other  debts  not  in  the  DMP.  The  evidence
concerning the allegations in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: credit-card account charged off for $22,120. This debt is included
in Applicant’s DMP. A $78 payment was made on April 12, 2019. (AX X at 1.)
SOR  ¶  1.b:  vehicle  loan  charged  off  for  $9,697.  This  debt  is  included  in
Applicant’s DMP. A $204 payment was made on April 19, 2019. (AX X at 1.)
SOR ¶ 1.c: cellphone account placed for collection of $3,871. This debt was
settled for $1,858 in April 2019. (AX M.)
SOR  ¶  1.d:  unsecured  personal  loan  charged  off  for  $3,858.  This  debt  is
included in Applicant’s DMP, which provides for a monthly payment of $443. (AX X at 2.)
SOR ¶ 1.e: collection account placed for collection of $1,919. This debt was
added to Applicant’s DMP in May 2019, and it provides for monthly $300 payments. (AX
Y; Tr. 23-24.)
SOR ¶ 1.f: telecommunications account placed for collection of $460. In April
2019, this debt was settled for $322. (AX O.)
SOR  ¶  1.g:  utility  bill  placed  for  collection  of  $387.  This  debt  was  paid  in
October 2018. (AX P.)
SOR ¶ 1.h: telecommunications account placed for collection of $384. This
debt was settled for $268 in April 2019. (AX Q.)
SOR ¶ 1.i: cellphone account placed for collection of $2,937. This debt was
settled for $1,200 in March 2019. (AX R.)
SOR ¶ 1.j: cellphone account placed for collection of $1,122. This debt was
settled for $617 in May 2019. (AX S.)
SOR ¶ 1.k: child-support arrearage of $19,848. This debt is not reflected in the
credit  reports  submitted  in  evidence  by  Department  Counsel  (GX  4  and  5).  However,
Applicant disclosed delinquent alimony payments totaling $30,000 in his SCA, during a
personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  in  February  2018,  and  in  response  to  DOHA
interrogatories. (GX 1 at 51; GX 2 at 9-10; GX 3.) The arrearage is actually a combination
of alimony and child support. Applicant stopped paying child support and alimony when
he  was  unemployed  in  2013  and  2014.  (GX  2  at  10.)  Pursuant  to  a  court  order,  child
support and alimony are withheld from Applicant’s pay at the rate of $1,203 per month for
child support; $240 per month for a child-support arrearage; and $1,000  per month for
alimony. He is paid weekly, and $564 per week is withheld from his pay. (AX T; AX V.)
Between March 2013 and September 2019, he has paid a total of about $161,446 in child
support and alimony. (AX CC.)
In May 2016, Appellant filed a motion to terminate the alimony on the ground that
his  ex-wife  and  another  man  are  living  together  as  husband  and  wife  and  have  two
children together, but have not formally married because marriage would terminate  her
entitlement to alimony. The issue has not yet been resolved. (Tr. 17-18.)
Appellant’s ex-wife claims that he owes an arrearage of about $30,000 for alimony.
He  testified  that  he  has  paid  about  $39,000  in  alimony  since  he  filed  his  motion  to
terminate it. If his alimony payments are refunded, the amount refunded would offset the
child-support arrearage. (Tr. 28.) Applicant’s attorney for the alimony litigation is in the
process of scheduling a trial date. (AX FF.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.l and 1.m: failures to timely file federal and state income tax returns
for 2015, 2016, and 2017. In Applicant’s response to DOHA interrogatories, he stated
that he did not file federal and state tax returns for 2015, 2016, and 2017, because he
knew he was entitled to refunds, and he believed that his refunds would be seized  and
applied to the alimony arrearage. (GX 2 at 10; GX 3 at 3.) He testified that his accountant
advised him that he could file late if he was entitled to refunds, so long as he filed within
three years to avoid forfeiture of the refunds. (Tr. 29-30.) All past-due federal and state
tax returns were filed in March and April 2018. (AX W; AX-Z; AX EE.)
Applicant’s  net  monthly  income  is  about  $14,970.  He  has  monthly  expenses  of
about $7,943  and  debt  payments  of  about $5,602,  leaving  a net  monthly  remainder of
$1,424. (AX J.)
Applicant’s  site  manager  has  known  him  for  several  years  and  has  been  his
supervisor for one year. He states that Applicant “consistently demonstrates high moral
character  and  solid  personal  conduct.”  He  trusts  Applicant  “implicitly  and  without
hesitation.” (AX C at 1.)
Applicant’s project manager has known Applicant for five years and has been his
supervisor for three years. He states that Applicant “always seeks to do what is right and
honest for the  company  as  well  as  our U.S.  Navy  customer.”  He has  no doubts about
Applicant’s trustworthiness, judgment, and reliability. (AX C at 2.)
