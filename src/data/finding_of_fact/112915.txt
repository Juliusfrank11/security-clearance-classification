Applicant admitted to the allegations in  SOR ¶¶ 1.a.~1.d., and 1.g.. She denied
SOR  allegations  ¶¶  1.e.,  1.f.,  1.h.,  and  1.i.. After a  thorough  and  careful review  of  the
pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  39-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  pages  6
and 12.) She is divorced from an abusive husband, and has three children, two of which
live with Applicant and for whom she receives only “$70.00 a week” in child support. (TR
at  page  18  line  19  to  page  23  line  20.)  Applicant  attributes  her  financial  difficulties  to
leaving her abusive husband, coupled with periods of unemployment. (Id.) She currently
has about $9,000 in a savings account, and about $1,000 in a checking account. (TR at
page 26 line 14 to page 27 line 5.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a.  Applicant  admits  that  she  owes  about  $11,659  on  a  past-due  credit  card
account. Since October of 2018, Applicant has been making monthly payments of $250,
as evidenced by a payment agreement with the creditor. (TR at page 24 lines 1~23, and
AppX D.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.b. and 1.c. As a result of her divorce, Applicant and her former spouse had an
automobile and a motor cycle repossessed. (TR at page 24 line 24 to page 26 line 13.)
She  has  reached  a  settlement  agreement  with  the  creditor  to  pay  $3,079  towards  the
auto  debt  (1.b.),  and  $4,443  towards  the  motor  cycle  debt  (1.c.), with  payments  to  be
made  “no  later  than  October  11,  2019,”  as  evidenced  by  correspondence  from  the
creditor. (AppX F.) I find Applicant is making a good-faith effort to repay these debts.
1.d.    Applicant  admits  that  she  owes  about  $1,256  on  a  past-due  cell  phone
account.  Since  September  of  2018,  Applicant  has  been  making  monthly  payments  of
$125, as evidenced by receipts from the creditor. (TR at page 27 line 11 to page 28 line
3, and AppX E.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.e. and 1.f. Applicant denies that she owes State E about $6,494. (see GX 5 at
pages 5~6.) Her inquiries to State E have come up empty, and no such debt appears on
Applicant’s  November  2018,  March  2019,  and  April  2019  credit  reports  (CRs).  (TR  at
page  28  line  4  to  page  29  line  12,  at  page  36  lines  6~9,  GXs  6  and  7,  and  AppX  A.)
These allegations are found for Applicant.
1.g.  Applicant  admits  that  she  owed  the  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  about
$497 as the result of an overpayment by DoD. (TR at page 29 line 15 to page 30 line 2.)
This  alleged  past-due  debt  was  paid  in  September  of  2018,  as  evidenced  by  a
“Payment Confirmation” by DoD. (AppX C.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.h. and 1.i. Applicant denies that she owes the Department of Veterans Affairs
about $5,303. This debt was “paid” through the Department of Treasury, as reflected on
Applicant’s  April  2019  CR.  (TR  at  page  30  line  2  to  page  32  line  11,  and  AppX  A  at
pages 13 and 15, See also AppX B.) These allegations are found for Applicant.
