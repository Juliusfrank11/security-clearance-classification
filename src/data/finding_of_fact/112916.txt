Applicant, 36, has worked for her current employer, a consulting firm, since 2010.
In her position as a management consultant, she has occasion to work on assignments
that require access to classified information. She was first granted  access to classified
information while sponsored by a previous employer in September 2008. She has since
maintained  security  clearance  eligibility.  Applicant  completed  her  most  recent  security
clearance  application  in  January  2017  to  obtain  a  higher  level  of  access.  On  the
application,  she  disclosed  marijuana  use  from  May  2002  to  December  2005  and  then
again  from  October  2010  to  September  2015,  while  holding  a  security  clearance.
Applicant’s marijuana use is the basis for the SOR. (Tr. 21, 51; GE 1-2.)
Applicant  used  marijuana  while  in  college  from  2002  to  2005.  She  testified  that
she first used marijuana when it was passed to her at a party and that she continued to
use  the  drug  in  similar  social  settings  until  she  graduated.  In  her  2008  security
clearance application and at hearing, Applicant admitted that  she used marijuana eight
times while in college and that she stopped using to improve her chances of  getting a
federal job or a job that required a security clearance. (Tr. 33-35, 55-56; GE 2.)
Applicant  abstained  from  the  drug  for  five  years.  In  2010,  she  claims  that  she
accidentally  consumed  the  drug  at  a  friend’s  party.  After  this  incident  of  accidental
ingestion,  she  admits  to  resuming  marijuana  use  in  social  settings.  She  also  used  the
drug  while  on  vacation  in  the  Netherlands  in  2011.  She  claims  to  have  stopped  using
the drug in 2015. It is unclear from the record how many times between 2010 and 2015
Applicant used the drug. On her January 2017 security clearance application, Applicant
disclosed that she, “… rarely use[d], (maybe once or twice a year, if at all), estimating
10  to  15  times  within  the  last  10  years.”  Applicant  admits  that  her  drug  use  between
2010  and  2015  occurred  while  she  had  a  security  clearance  and  that  she  worked  on
projects  that  required  access  to  classified  information  during  that  time.  Between  2010
and  2015,  Applicant  experienced  professional  growth  with  increased  responsibilities,
including  two  promotions  and  supervisory  duties.  To  her  knowledge,  Applicant’s
employer  does  not  have  a  policy  prohibiting  drug  use  or  a  drug-testing  program.  She
also claims she was unaware of her duty to report illegal drug use to her facility security
officer. (Tr. 35-42, 48-49, 59, 61, 77-78; GE 1.)
Applicant claims that marijuana use is no longer consistent with her lifestyle. She
is  serious  about  her  career,  which  is  evident  through  her  positive  performance
evaluations  and  awards.  She  is  active  in  her  employer’s  community  efforts  and
participates  in  several  volunteer  activities  on  her  personal  time.  Applicant  claims  that
she has  withdrawn  from  the friend  groups  with  whom  she used marijuana.  At  hearing,
she presented several character letters in addition to the testimony of two witnesses. All
attest to her drug-free lifestyle and overall good character. Applicant submitted a signed
statement of intent to abstain from  future drug use.  She has also been in contact with
her employer’s security office about the existence of a drug-testing program in the event
she is granted a conditional clearance. (Tr. 29-32, 43-46, 53-54, 78-102; AE A-F, I-M.)
In January 2019, in preparation of the hearing, Applicant submitted to a voluntary
substance  abuse  evaluation.  The  evaluator,  a  licensed  clinical  social  worker  (LCSW),
specializing  in  substance  abuse  and  addictions  counseling,  interviewed  Applicant,
performed  a  drug  assessment-screening  test,  reviewed  the  SOR,  and  the  AG.  The
LCSW  did  not  review  the  Applicant’s  security  clearance  applications.  During  the
interview,  Applicant  told  the  LCSW  that  she  only  used  marijuana  on  three  occasions
between  2002  and  2005,  not  eight  as  disclosed  on  her  2008  security  clearance
application. According to the evaluation report, Applicant described her use as reluctant,
only succumbing to the insistence  and pressure of her peers. Applicant only described
three  instances  of  marijuana  use  between  2010  and  2015,  two  of  which  were
accidental.  The  LCSW  opined  that  Applicant  was  remorseful  about  her  conduct  and
diagnosed  her  with  “No  Use  Disorder,”  and  determined  that  no  treatment  was
warranted.  (AE G-H.)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  she  did  not  appreciate  the  prohibition
against marijuana use while having  a security clearance. According to Applicant, other
individuals in her friend group between 2010 and 2015, led her to believe that marijuana
use  while  holding  a  security  clearance  was  not  a  “big  deal”  and  would  likely  be
admonished by a “finger wag.”
