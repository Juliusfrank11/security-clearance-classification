Applicant admitted the SOR financial allegations, except for SOR 1.g-1.h. He is a
49-year-old critical facilities engineer sponsored for a public trust position by a defense
contractor,  for  whom  he  has  worked  since  July  2016.  He  has  not  previously  had  a
trustworthiness determination. He was briefly unemployed May-July 2016, but had been
continuously  employed  as  a  maintenance  engineer  from  May  2004  to  May  2016.
Applicant married in May 1991, separated in August 2016, and divorced in September
2017 (Item 2, 3). He and his ex-wife have two adult children.
The SOR alleges, and Government exhibits (Items 2-5) establish, 14 delinquent
debts totaling over $28,000 (SOR 1.b-1.o); the SOR also alleges that Applicant failed to
timely  file  his  2014-2016  state  income  tax  returns  (SOR  1.a).  Applicant  admits  over
$24,000 in delinquent debt, as well as admitting failing to timely file his 2014-2016 state
income tax returns. He claims to have settled SOR debt 1.g in October 2018 (Answer;
Item 3). However, Applicant’s evidence shows that he settled a delinquent debt that was
not  alleged  in  the  SOR. 3  Applicant  also  claimed  to  have  paid  the  automobile  loan  at
SOR  1.h.  While  the  automobile  title  Applicant  submitted  with  his  Answer  does  not
corroborate  that  claim,  Applicant’s  October  2018  credit  report  shows the  account  paid
as of July 2017.4
The remaining debts comprise three state tax liens, totaling over $12,000, filed in
January  and  July 2013; three  unpaid medical bills totaling over $800; a nearly $7,000
automobile  repossession;  a  2013  judgment  for  $2,500,  and  five  collection  accounts
totaling  over  $2,600.  The  automobile  repossession  is  a  joint  account  with  his  ex-wife.
The medical debts and collection accounts are reported as Applicant’s individual liability.
All but a couple of the delinquent debts predate Applicant’s separation from his wife.
Applicant  disclosed  his  failure  to  timely  file  his  2014-2015  state  income  tax
returns,  as  well  as  his  failure  to  file  his  2014-2015  Federal  income  tax  returns  (not
alleged), on his March 2017 clearance application (Item 2). He discussed his tax issues,
including  his  failure  to  timely  file  his  2016  state  and  Federal  tax  returns,  during  a
January  2018  interview  with  a  Government  investigator  (Item  3).  He  was  also
confronted  with  his  SOR  debts,  based  on  his  April  2017  credit  report  (Item  4).  He
claimed to not be aware of some of the debts,  but stated that he would investigate all
the debts discussed and take action to address them.
3Applicant’s April 2017 credit report (Item 4) shows a delinquent mattress retailer store credit card, with its
sponsoring bank, and a full 16-digit account number. This account was reported in collection, but also closed,
with a zero  balance, and was not alleged in the SOR. The 2 October 2018 settlement letter provided by
Applicant is from a collection agent for a different sponsoring bank, but with an account number that exactly
matches the original creditor.
4Applicant’s April 2017 credit report (Item 4) showed the account 60-days past due for $237 on a $2,948
balance. His October 2018 credit report (Item 5) shows the same creditor, with an account number matching
the first 12 digits of the original debt, as current, with no stated balance as of July 2017.
Applicant attributes his financial problems, particularly his failures to timely file his
state  income  tax  returns,  to  his  contentious  separation  and  divorce.  His  Answer
documented that he had finally filed his 2015 and 2016 state income tax returns—after
he  received  the  SOR—but  he  had  still  not  filed  his  2014  return.  He  ostensibly  has  a
refund coming for one tax year, and  owes twice the  amount of  the  putative refund  for
the  other  tax  year,  but  his  tax  situation  for  2014  remains  unclear.  Even  assuming  the
state seizes the refund and applies it to the balance owed, Applicant did not document
any  payment  toward  the  balance.  Moreover,  except  as  noted  above,  he  provided  no
evidence of any efforts to resolve delinquent debts since his divorce.
Applicant  provided  no  budget  or  personal  financial  statement  indicating  his
financial  situation.  He  has  not  documented  any  credit  or  financial  counseling.  He
provided  no  work  or  character  references,  or  evidence  of  civic  or  community
involvement.
