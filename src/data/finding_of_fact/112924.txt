In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d,
2.a, and 2.c. He denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.b. His admissions in his answer and
at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 24-year-old mechanic employed by a defense contractor. (Tr. 21.)
He  has  never  held  a  security  clearance.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  June  2012
and attended a university for three months. He does not know his biological father, and
he was raised by his grandparents. He left home after graduating from high school and
lived in an apartment with his brother and his brother’s girlfriend.  He was evicted from
the apartment because of noise coming from the apartment, apparently because of loud
arguments  between  his  brother  and  his  brother’s  girlfriend,  and  he  began  living  in  his
car.  He  now  rents  a  house  owned  by  his  grandfather.  (GX  4  at  2;  Tr.  28-29.)  He  has
never married, but he has a six-year-old son. (GX 1 at 21, 24.)
Applicant worked as a cook at a retirement facility from October 2012 to October
2015. He was fired because he was late for work twice and failed to have his badge with
him when he clocked in. He explained that he was late for work because he  was living
in his car, overslept, and had problems with an unreliable car. He failed to swipe in with
his identification card because he had lost it. (GX 4 at 3-4.)
Applicant was unemployed for two months and then worked as a cook at a golf
course from November 2015 to February 2017. He worked for a defense contractor as a
marine  painter  from  February  2017  to  September  2017,  when  he  was  laid  off  due  to
budget cuts. He worked for a defense contractor as a maintenance helper from January
to  June  2018.  (GX  4  at  3-4.)  His  supervisor  submitted  a  letter  of  recommendation  for
him, describing him as bright, personable, highly motivated, and a “valuable resource.”
(AX A.) Since September 2018, he has been employed by another defense contractor.
His  most  recent  supervisor  submitted  a  letter  of  recommendation  describing  him  as
having a great attitude and a sense of urgency. (AX C.).
In  September  2015,  Applicant  was  involved  in  an  altercation  with  his  then
cohabitant, when she tried to prevent him from moving out. She began hitting him as he
gathered up his possessions, and he grabbed her around the waist to prevent her from
hitting  him.  His  cohabitant’s  sister  called  the  police  and  accused  him  of  choking  his
cohabitant.  The  police  arrested  him  for  domestic  assault  and  battery.  His  cohabitant
denied that Applicant had choked her. Applicant and his then cohabitant agreed to have
no contact with each other, and the prosecutor filed a nolle prosequi. (GX 3; GX 4 at 2;
Tr. 25.)
When Applicant submitted his SCA in June 2017, he answered “No” to questions
asking whether, during the last seven years, he had been issued a summons, citation,
or  ticket  to  appear  in  court  in  a  criminal  proceeding;  had  been  arrested  by  any  law-
enforcement  official;  or  had  been  charged,  convicted,  or  sentenced  for  a  crime  in  any
court. He did not disclose that he was arrested and charged with domestic assault and
battery in September 2015. In May 2018, he told a security investigator that he did not
disclose  his  arrest  and  charge  of  domestic  assault  and  battery  because  he  did  not
understand the question. He fully disclosed the incident to the security investigator. (GX
4 at 3; Tr. 29.) In his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, he stated that he thought
he  was  required  to  disclose  only  arrests  that  resulted  in  convictions,  and  he  did  not
disclose  the  arrest  for  domestic  assault  and  battery  because  he  was  not  convicted.
(SOR Answer; Tr. 30.)

Speeding  49  mph  in  a  35-
mph zone
Speeding  74  mph  in  a  55-

Even  though  the  seat-belt  violation  and  speeding  tickets  were  alleged  under
Guideline  J,  the  court  records  reflect  that  the  seat-belt  violation  and  speeding  tickets
were civil infractions and not criminal offenses. As such, they should have been alleged
under Guideline E, and I have considered them under that guideline.
Applicant testified that he initially did not bother to obtain a driver’s license due to
immaturity and inexperience. He needed transportation to his job, and needed to work
because he had a newborn son. (Tr. 22.) He now holds an unrestricted driver’s license.
He attached documentation to his answer to the SOR, reflecting that all fines and court
costs had been paid.
Applicant’s grandfather, with whom he lived while growing up, submitted a letter
describing  Applicant’s  involvement  in  youth  activities.  Applicant  has  volunteered  to
serve as an equipment and uniform specialist and an assistant coach three to five days
a week. He has a reputation for being dependable, honest, loyal, and hardworking. (AX
