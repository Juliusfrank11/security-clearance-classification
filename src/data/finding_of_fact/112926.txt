In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.n.  Applicant’s
admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.
Applicant is a 63-year-old systems engineer who has been employed by the same
defense  contractor  since  2011.  His  annual  salary  is  approximately  $100,000.  He  has
taken side jobs over the past four years and earned an additional $10,000 - $15,000 per
year.  He  served  in  the  Air  Force  from  1974  to  1980,  and  he  received  an  honorable
discharge  at  the  rank  of  E-4.  He  attended  college  from  1981  to  1985  and  earned  two
associates degrees. In 1994, he married and has two adult stepchildren from his wife’s
former marriage, and they have a daughter, age 24, and a son, age 20. (Tr. 19-20, 23-
28, 42-44; GE 1)
Financial Considerations
SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b  and  1.c  allege  Applicant  owes  Federal  income  taxes  of  about
$250,418  for  tax  years  1998  through  2006.  These  allegations  are  established  by
Applicant’s admissions and the Government’s evidence. Applicant’s tax issues began in
the late 1990s after he researched and adopted tax-protestor theories. He believed the
Federal income tax system was invalid and non-obligatory. He did not pay income taxes,
and he stopped filing his income tax returns for several years. At the hearing, Applicant
was vague with details due to the passage of time. He admitted there were years he filed
income tax returns in which he intentionally omitted or underreported his income for that
tax period. He filed some of his Federal income tax returns in about 2007, but he could
not recall the specific tax years he filed. (Tr. 29-34; GE 4-6)
Applicant’s  tax  beliefs  changed  in  approximately  2007  after  a  prominent  tax
protestor he followed was incarcerated. Applicant realized he needed to address his tax
and other financial issues. He admitted he had received numerous IRS tax notices over
the years informing him of his legal requirement to file and pay Federal taxes. (Tr. 34-36)
Applicant retained a tax preparation service, and according to their calculations,
Applicant owed the IRS a total of $12,000 for tax  year 2006. During his October 2017
background interview, he had admitted he owed $3,550 in Federal taxes for 2008, and
$2,415 in Federal taxes for 2012.
Applicant’s position at the hearing was that he no longer owed any Federal taxes
for any tax year earlier than 2006, and he will not take any action to resolve those tax
debts. He does not currently have any installment agreement in place with the IRS for the
Federal taxes that he does owe, and has not made any payments to the IRS for the past
three years. Applicant failed to provide copies of his tax records during the 30-day period
the record was held open.  Applicant’s delinquent Federal taxes of about $250,418  are
unresolved. (Tr. 29-35, 37-42, 54, 57; GE 4-6; AE A)
SOR ¶¶ 1.d, and 1.f-1.n allege delinquent medical accounts for $1,489, to include
four accounts with a balance under $100. Applicant admitted these debts, but he has not
made  arrangements  to  pay  these  outstanding  accounts.  These  delinquent  medical
accounts are unresolved. (Tr. 46-47, 55; GE 2, GE 3)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges an unpaid utility account referred for collection in the amount of
$358. (GE XX) Applicant admitted this debt in his SOR response. There is no evidence
in the record to show that the debt is paid, or otherwise being resolved. (GE 3)
Applicant is embarrassed about his early tax history and the tax-protestor theories
he  once  followed.  He  has  never  participated  in  financial  counseling.  He  continues  to
financially support his son and daughter, and he pays for both of their car payments. His
step-son has been involved in a contentious custody battle. Applicant and his wife have
recently given him about $12,000 for his legal expenses. He has been unable to make
payments toward his delinquent financial obligations since he does not have any available
funds to do so. Applicant provided no monthly budget or evidence of his monthly income
and expenses during the 30-day period the record was held open. (Tr. 45-48, 51-52, 57-
58)
