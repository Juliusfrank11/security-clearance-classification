Applicant  admitted  all  but  one  of  the  SOR  allegations  (SOR  ¶  1.n).  Her
admissions  are  incorporated  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for
this employer since October 2009. She has earned college credits and holds technical
certifications.  She  is  married  for  the  second  time  and  has  three  adult  children.  Her
husband  is  sporadically  employed  as  a  contractor  and  experienced  severe  medical
issues in 2016.1
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  owed  15  delinquent  debts  totaling  approximately
$27,091.  The  debts  included  a  repossessed  vehicle  and  consumer  debts.  The
allegations are supported by credit reports from November 2017 and October 2018, her
answers  to  questions  from  a  defense  investigator  in  September  2018  (PSI),  and
admissions in her SOR answer.2
Applicant explained that she got behind on her debts because of her husband’s
unemployment,  requiring  her  to  pay  all  their  bills  from  her  earnings.  In  her  PSI,  she
acknowledged  contact  by  the  various  creditors,  but  she  failed  to  respond  due  to  her
inability  to  repay  the  debts.  She  documented  completing  a  30-minute  financial
consultation  with  a  money  coach  in  March  2019.  The  consultation  included  describing
strategies  to  deal  with  her  debt  problems.  She  did  not  provide  any  documentation
showing that she had paid any of the debts, or that she had entered into any payment
agreements with any creditors. She did not provide documentation to dispute any debts.
Her debts remain unresolved.3
Applicant did not provide any information about her current financial situation or a
budget.  She  provided  three  character  letters  from  coworkers.  She  is  described  as  a
dedicated, hardworking, and trusted employee.4
