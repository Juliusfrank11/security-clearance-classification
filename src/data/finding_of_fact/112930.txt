Applicant’s ex-husband used illegal drugs, could not hold a job, and was abusive.
She attempted to make the marriage work, but his behavior worsened to the point that
she had to leave and have a restraining order issued against him. He destroyed much
of her property and left her with almost nothing from the marriage except debt and her
child,  for  whom  he  does  not  pay  child  support.  (Tr.  at  17-27,  39,  65;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2; AE A)
Applicant and her then husband filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in May 2016.
Under Schedule D, Creditors Holding Secured Claims, the petition listed $12,700 owed
on  an  auto  loan.  Under  Schedule  E,  Creditors  Holding  Unsecured  Priority  Claims,  the
petition listed $5,500 owed to the IRS for 2012 income taxes; $2,500 owed to their state
for  2012  income  taxes;  and  $400  for  2013  state  income  taxes.  The  petition  listed
$70,522  in  student  loans  and  $21,731  in  other  debts  under  Schedule  F,  Creditors
Holding Unsecured Nonpriority Claims. (Tr. at 21-23, 50; Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 3)
The bankruptcy records indicate that the IRS asserted $3,663 in claims for 2012,
which  included  $2,015  in  taxes;  $364  in  interest;  and  $1,283  in  penalties.  The  state
asserted  $2,834  in  claims,  which  included  taxes,  interest,  and  penalties  for  tax  years
2012  and  2013.  In  June  2016,  Applicant and  her husband filed  a motion  to  voluntarily
dismiss the case. The case was dismissed in August 2016. Applicant stated that by that
time,  she  knew  that  she  was  not  going  to  remain  in the  marriage  and  bankruptcy  was
impractical. (Tr. at 23; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3)
The SOR alleges the Chapter 13 bankruptcy; $5,500 owed to the IRS for tax year
2012; $2,500 owed to the state for tax year 2012; $11,320 owed on a charged-off auto
loan;  an  auto  loan  that  was  $877  past  due,  with  a  $12,426  balance;  5  miscellaneous
delinquent debts totaling $1,410, and 14 defaulted student loans totaling about $78,600.
Applicant  admitted  owing  all  the  debts  with  the  exception  of  the  state  and  federal
income taxes and the past-due auto loan.
Applicant  established  that  she  does  not  owe  any  federal  income  taxes.  She
documented that $2,397 was withheld from her  $3,641 refund from 2017 to satisfy her
2012  taxes.  She  received  the  remaining  refund of  $1,243,  which  indicates  she  did not
owe  any  additional  taxes.  She  provided a  copy  of  her 2019  tax  transcript  that  showed
her  $4,832  refund  was  withheld  and  applied  to  a  non-IRS  debt.  (Tr.  at  32-34,  56-57;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2; AE C, D, Z, AA)
Applicant owed $1,306 in state income taxes for 2012 and $369 for 2013, for a
total of $1,675. The state withheld her $245 refund from 2017 and applied it to her 2012
taxes. Her 2018 tax return was filed, but not yet acted on by the state. She anticipates a
refund  of  $1,085  to  be  withheld  for  her  back  taxes,  leaving  a  balance  of  $345.  She
hopes her ex-husband will pay the balance as part of the divorce decree. She will pay it
if he does not. (Tr. at 34; GE 2; AE C, P, Q)
Applicant  rehabilitated  her  student  loans.  They  were  consolidated  into  one  loan
totaling  $83,472  in  March  2019.  She  is  current  on  her  $327  monthly  payments.  As  of
August  2019,  the  balance  was  $80,005.  (Tr.  at  30-31,  75-77;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 2, 4-6; AE C, E, F)
Applicant  entered  into  a  payment  agreement  in  August  2019  with  the  company
collecting the $403 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.l. She agreed to pay $67 per month for six
months. She made the first payment in September 2019. (Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 4-6; AE C, G, H)
Applicant  settled  the  $232  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.m  for  $130,  payable  in  five
monthly  $26  payments,  commencing  in  October  2019.  She  paid  the  $130  settlement
amount in full in September 2019. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 4-6; AE C, I)
SOR ¶ 1.l alleges an auto loan that was $877 past due, with a $12,426 balance.
Applicant was rear-ended by another car in  December 2016. Her car was a total loss.
Her  insurance  company  valued  the  car  at  $11,125,  but  the  loan  payoff  was  $11,729.
The insurance company negotiated with the creditor to accept $11,125 as a settlement
of the loan. The creditor accepted the settlement and released the lien to the insurance
company, thereby ending Applicant’s liability for the loan. (Tr. at 25-26; GE 2, 4-6; AE C,
J, K)
Applicant  entered  into  a  payment  agreement  with  the  company  collecting  the
$300  medical  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.x.  She  agreed  to  pay  $50  per  month  for  six
months. She made the first payment in September 2019. (Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 4-6; AE C, L)
Applicant  has  worked  for  her  company  since  2017,  but  she  has  only  been
earning a good salary and able to address her financial difficulties for about a year. Her
current  financial  situation  is  much  better.  She  paid  or  is  paying  debts  that  were  not
alleged  in  the  SOR.  There  are  three  SOR  debts  she  has  not  yet  addressed,  primarily
the $11,320 owed on a charged-off auto loan. She hopes her ex-husband will pay half
of  the  debt.  She  stated  that  she  will  start  paying  it  in  2020,  with  or  without  her  ex-
husband’s help. She credibly stated that she is committed to maintaining her finances in
order and paying her debts. (Tr. at 28, 38-48, 64-75; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE
1, 2, 4-6; AE C)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
April 2017. She reported her Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, two defaulted auto loans, and
that she had sought financial counseling “to get [her] financials back on track.” She did
not  report  owing  any  state  or  federal  income  taxes  because  she  was  not  completely
aware of the tax issues. She credibly stated that she did not intentionally provide false
information about her finances on the SF 86. (Tr. at 32-33, 50-56; Applicant’s response
to SOR; GE 1, 2)
