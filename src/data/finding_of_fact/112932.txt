Applicant,  35,  is  single,  and  has  no  children.  In  2013,  he  received  a  bachelor’s
degree  in  information  and  decision  science.  He  held  a  top  secret  clearance  with
it  was
information  access  (TS/SCI)
sensitive  compartmented
downgraded  to  a  TS  security  clearance  in  2016.  He  has  worked  as  a  senior  software
engineer for a defense contractor since October 2013. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3 at 16; Tr. 9-
11)
from  2014  until
Applicant  started  consuming  alcohol  in  2000,  when  he  was  15.  He  would  go  to
parties and drink beer to the point of intoxication.  Applicant was charged with unlawful
consumption of alcohol by a minor in June 2001,  July 2002, and January 2003. These
incidents  occurred  when  he  was  in  high  school  and  within  9  months  of  his  June  2002
graduation. He received fines and was placed on supervision for these incidents. (GE 1
at 15; GE 3 at 13; Tr. 23-25)
After Applicant turned 21 in 2005, his drinking increased as he was able to go to
bars. He consumed six to eight drinks a night, once or twice a week. Applicant primarily
used  designated  drivers  and  taxis  to  get  home,  but  admitted  at  the  hearing  that  on
occasion, he drank and then drove in an impaired state. In September 2006, Applicant
was charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor after he provided alcohol to
an  underage  girl  who  was  at  a  party  at  his  home.  He  was  unaware  that  she  was
underage,  but  pled  guilty,  and  he  was  fined,  placed  on  supervision,  and  required  to
perform community service. (GE 1 at 38-41; GE 3 at 14; GE 5 at 4; Tr. 24, 26-28)
In April 2008, Applicant’s mother called the police, because he was fighting with
his  brother  in  their  home.  The  police  came  to  their  home  and  intervened,  giving
Applicant  and  his  brother  verbal  warnings.  They  were  both  intoxicated,  and  this
contributed  to  the  escalation;  however,  Applicant  denied  being  arrested  and  charged
with domestic battery. (GE 3 at 22-23; Tr. 24-26)
Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  battery  by  campus  police  in  August
2011.  He  went  to  a  bar  with  friends  during  an  afternoon  break  from  classes  and
consumed  alcohol  to  the  point  of  intoxication.  After  returning  to  campus,  he  “flung  his
sandal,” which hit another student in the face. As a result of this incident: he was placed
on academic probation for six months; he was required to write a letter of apology to the
other student; and attend one to two Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings a month for
the remainder of the school year. He was 26 at the time of the incident. (Tr. 28-31; GE 1
at 33-34, GE 3 at 7-8; GE 5 at 5; 45)
In  October  2011,  Applicant  received  a  $250  ticket  for  having  an  open  bottle  of
beer at a parade. He was 27 at the time of the incident. (GE 1 at 34; GE 3 at 11-12)
Applicant was arrested and charged with three counts of battery and damage to
property in April 2012. He was at a bar consuming alcohol with friends. After his friends
left the bar, Applicant got into an argument with another patron, which turned physical.
Applicant  testified  the  fight  escalated  to  the  point  that  he  fought  three  patrons  and  a
bartender,  resulting  in  him  being  badly  beaten.  As  the  instigator  of  the  fight,  he  was
convicted and ordered to pay a $350 fine, perform 50 hours of community service, and
complete  one  year  of  supervised  probation.  He  successfully  completed  all  of  these
terms and reduced his level of drinking to once a month.  (GE 1 at 34-36; GE 3 at 12;
GE 5 at 5-7; Tr. 31-34)
In 2014, Applicant’s consumption of alcohol increased to three nights a week, as
a coping mechanism for a breakup with a girlfriend. In February 2015, Applicant went to
a bar and consumed beer and shots of vodka. The next day, which was a Saturday, he
took  an  Uber  ride-share  to  work.  After arriving  at  work,  he  fell  asleep  at  his  desk.  His
coworkers  woke  him  and  could  smell  alcohol  on  his  breath.  A  coworker  drove  him
home. As a result of this incident, his supervisor and facility security officer gave him a
verbal warning. Applicant knew he was planning to go to the office on Saturday before
he consumed alcohol the previous night. (GE 1 at 43-44; GE 2 a 2; GE 3 at 15; Tr. 34-
36, 39, 56, 60)
As  a  result  of  the  February  2015  work  incident,  Applicant  voluntarily  went  to
intensive  outpatient  alcohol-counseling  treatment.  According  to  Applicant,  he  was
diagnosed  with  “alcoholism.”  He  attended  three-hour  group-counseling  sessions  three
nights  a  week  after  work.  As  part  of  the  program,  he  was  required  to  attend  two
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings a week. Once a week he was given a urinalysis.
(GE 1 at 43-46; GE 3 at 15-16; GE 6; Tr. 35-41)
In  March  2015,  Applicant  was  discharged  two  or  three  weeks  early,  against
clinical advice. Applicant testified that he left the program early because he was unable
to perform his job and attend the nine hours of counseling each week. Additionally, he
believed  that  he  did  not  need  the  program.  At  the  time  of  his  discharge,  it  was
recommended that he continue to abstain from alcohol and continue treatment.  He did
not discuss this issue or ask for accommodations from his supervisor, because he was
ashamed. (GE 1 at 43-46; GE 3 at 15-16; GE 6; Tr. 35-40)
Applicant  abstained  from  using  alcohol  from  February  2015  until  September
2015.  After  he  was  discharged  from  the  treatment  program  in  March  2015,  he
discontinued  attending  AA  meetings.  In  September 2015,  Applicant  started  consuming
alcohol  once  or  twice  a  week,  because  he  was  under  stress  at  work,  and  he  was
concerned about company layoffs. He drank to the point of intoxication once or twice a
month. (GE 1 at 44; GE 3 at 15-16; Tr. 40-42)
In March 2016, Applicant moved to a new state for work where he had no friends
or  family.  He  was  lonely  and  started  drinking  heavily.  A  month  later,  he  was  arrested
and charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI). While Applicant was driving to work at
about 7:00 in the morning he struck a parked vehicle. The night before the incident, he
watched hockey with a neighbor, and he consumed alcohol until approximately 2:00 or
3:00 in the morning. Applicant admitted he was still intoxicated when he drove to work,
and his blood alcohol content (BAC) was .12.  As a result of his conviction: Applicant’s
license was restricted for 12 months; he was required to use an interlock device for  six
months; pay fines; and attend 25 ASAP classes. In December 2016, Applicant had an
interlock violation. He claimed this was the result of consuming cough syrup.  Applicant
reported the arrest to his facility security officer (FSO) in a timely manner. (GE 1 at 36-
37; GE 2 a 2; GE 3 at 12-13, 15-16; GE 5 at 2, 9; Tr. 41-45; 70)
From  September  2016  until  April  2017,  Applicant  went  to  alcohol  counseling
twice  a  week.  His  goal  during  this  treatment  was  to  completely  abstain  from  using
alcohol.  His  treatment  records  reflect  that  he  consumed  alcohol  on  New  Year’s  Eve
2016  and  at  a  Super  Bowl  party  in  February  2017.  Applicant  acknowledged  in  group
counseling  sessions  that  he  had  these  “slips”  and  consumed  alcohol.  He  had  several
urinalyses  that  were  positive  for  medications  for  which  he  did  not  have  prescriptions,
and he had one urinalysis that was positive for alcohol. (GE 3 at 13; GE 5 at 14, 19, 29,
30, 32, 33, 35, 36, 38-40, 43-44; Tr. 36, 45-50)
According  to  Applicant,  the  treatment  facility  recommended  that  he  continue  to
abstain  from  alcohol,  and  he  was  diagnosed  with  “alcoholism.”  Applicant’s  probation
ended in July 2017, and he resumed consuming alcohol in September 2017, despite the
treatment facility’s recommendation that he continue to abstain from all consumption of
alcohol. (GE 5; Tr. 64-66)
Applicant attended a wedding in September 2017, where he consumed alcohol to
the point of intoxication. He testified that he consumed one or two shots at the wedding;
however,  in  his  January  2019  response  to  DOD  interrogatories,  he  admitted  he  was
intoxicated. He also consumed alcohol at Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2017. (GE 2 at
1; GE 3 at 3, 15, 23; GE 5; Tr. 50-55)
During  his  April  2018  background  interview,  Applicant  claimed  he  quit  drinking
alcohol in January 2018, and did not intend to consume alcohol in the future, unless he
was  at  a  social  gathering.  In  July  2018,  he  went  on  a  work  trip  and  consumed  two
beers. He also consumed alcohol at Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2018. At the time of
the  hearing,  he  had  not  consumed  alcohol  in  2019.  He  admitted  that  his  most  recent
period  of  abstinence  was,  in  part,  the  result  of  the  DOD  interrogatories  and  SOR.  He
also  loves  how  his  life  is  “without  alcohol  controlling  it.”  Applicant  attended  an  AA
meeting  approximately  two  weeks  before  the  hearing  and once  in August, but  has not
attended any other meetings since April 2017. He attended these meetings upon advice
from an attorney. He has never had an AA sponsor, despite recommendations from the
2017 treatment. (GE 2 at 1; GE 3 at 3, 15, 23; GE 5; Tr. 50-55, 57-58)
Applicant  characterized  his  consumption  of  alcohol  since  July  2017  as  “playing
with fire,” but claimed he is no longer interested in drinking, and he intends to continue
to abstain. In the past when he consumed alcohol, he would almost always drink to the
point  of  intoxication,  and  he  admitted  to  having  a  problem  with  alcohol.  Applicant  has
experienced blackouts, most recently in April 2016. The DWI was a “wake-up call,” and
he  admittedly  shrugged  off  his  alcohol  issues  “for  far  too  long.”  He  admitted  that  his
mother and brother have expressed to him their concerns regarding his consumption of
alcohol. (Tr. 14, 61-64, 66, 76)
Applicant obtained an alcohol and substance use evaluation in September 2019
upon  the  recommendation  of  an  attorney.  The  evaluation  determined  that  based  upon
Applicant’s nine months of sobriety and responses to various tests, he was a low risk for
a substance use disorder for the previous 12 months. Additionally, his urinalysis which
was administered the week before the hearing was negative for alcohol. (AE A; Tr. 57-
58)
Applicant  regularly  exercises  and  seeks  out  hobby  activities  as  coping
mechanisms.  He  has  never  had  a  security  issue,  and  he  believes  he  has  made
necessary positive changes in his life.  Applicant informed his supervisor that he had a
DOHA hearing related to the 2016 DWI. In his 2018 performance evaluation, Applicant
is  described  as  a  key  player,  hardworking,  a  subject  matter  expert,  courteous,  and
professional. (AE B; Tr. 14, 56, 69)
