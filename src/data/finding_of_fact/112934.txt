Having  thoroughly  considered  the  evidence  in  the  record,  including  Applicant's
admissions,  I  make  the  following  findings  of  fact:    Applicant  is  42  years  old  and  was
previously employed in a warehousing position from 2010 to 2016. In September 2014,
the  employees  went  on  strike  for  approximately  six  months.  In  January  2017,  she
obtained  word  processing  employment  with  a  DOD  contractor.  She  received  a
certification from a college of business in 1997. She was married in 2006, and she has
two daughters, ages 6 and 11. She currently possesses a DOD security clearance. (Tr.

Financial Considerations
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  21  delinquent  accounts  totaling  about
$24,000.  Approximately  half  of  the  accounts  are  for  unpaid  medical  expenses.  She
admitted that the debts developed over a long period of time, and were initially ignored
by  her.  Her  financial  problems  worsened  after  Applicant  and  her  husband,  who  were
working for the same employer, went on strike in September 2014. For six months, they
each received $150 weekly strike pay to support their family. In March 2015, the union
ended the strike, and they resumed their employment with less pay per hour.  In 2016,
Applicant was laid off after working for her employer for seven weeks. In January 2017,
she  was  offered  a  position  with  her  current  employer.  In  2017,  she  and  her  husband
realized that they needed to take action and resolve their delinquent accounts. (Tr. 20-
30, 33-34)
In  mid-2017,  Applicant’s  father-in-law  offered  to  let  the  family  stay  at  his  house
rent-free,  He  also  paid  for  all  of  the  utilities,  and  they  were  responsible  for  their  own
groceries.  He  wanted  to  help  them  take  control  of  their  growing  debt.  After  Applicant
and  her  family  moved  in  with  her  father-in-law,  she  began  making  payments  on  the
delinquent  accounts;  however,  her  father-in-law  unexpectedly  passed  away  a  few
months later. They assumed his mortgage payment and the utilities for the house. (Tr.
20-30, 33-34)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d, 1.g, 1.j, 1.l-1.s, and 1.u, allege unpaid medical accounts totaling
$13,500. Applicant underwent unexpected surgery in 2016. She had medical insurance,
but the remaining balance that was her responsibility was overwhelming. In addition, her
children  suffered  with  medical  issues  periodically,  and  the  insurance  only  covered  a
small portion of the medical expense.  At the time of the hearing, she did not have any
payment  arrangements  in  place  with  her  medical  creditors,  but  it  was  her  intention  to
pay these accounts. The medical debts remain unresolved. (Tr. 39-41)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  a  student  loan  account  referred  for  collection  with  the
Department  of  Education  in  the  amount  of  $6,460.  In  January  2019,  Applicant  made
arrangements  to  rehabilitate  this  account  by  paying  $222  a  month  for  nine  months  to
take the student loans out of default status. The payments are automatically withdrawn
from her bank account, and she has not missed any payments. This account will be in
good  standing  by  October  2019.  Applicant  provided  documentation  of  this  account
which showed that as of June 2019, she had reduced the outstanding loan balance to
$5,195. The student loan debt is being resolved. (Tr. 37-39; AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges an auto loan account charged-off in the amount of $1,607. In
2017,  Applicant  was  involved  in  a  car  accident,  and  the  other  driver  was  at  fault.  The
accident totaled her van. The insurance  compensation did not cover the full amount of
her auto loan. At the time of the hearing, Applicant had not yet made arrangements with
the creditor to resolve this account. (Tr. 41-42)
SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.k allege two delinquent  credit card accounts with a collection
agency in the total amount of $839. Applicant is currently in a repayment plan with this
creditor, and these accounts will be fully resolved in the near future.  After the hearing,
Applicant timely provided documentation that showed one of the accounts is paid in full.
The remaining account is currently being paid. (Tr. 37-38; AE B; SOR response)
SOR  ¶¶  1.f,  1.h,  1.i  and  1.t  allege  delinquent  accounts  totaling  $1,549.  At  the
time  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  had  not  yet  made  arrangements  with  the  creditors  to
resolve these accounts. These debts are unresolved.
In  March  2019,  Applicant  contacted  a  consumer  credit  counseling  agency,  and
she and her spouse received financial counseling. The credit counselor assisted her in
setting  up  a  plan  to  prioritize  her  debts.  Applicant  has  a  monthly  budget  in  place,  and
she intends to meet with a realtor to discuss selling her father-in-law’s house. Applicant
has asserted that once the house is sold, she will use some of the sale proceeds to pay
her  delinquent  debts.  She  is  current  on  her  monthly  financial  obligations  and  has  not
created any new delinquent debt. Last year, Applicant and her spouse made collectively
$72,000.  She  provided  documentation  of  her  budget,  her  consumer  counseling
program, and a notarized statement from her brother-in-law stating his intent to share all
proceeds once the house is sold. (Tr. 43-, 52; AE A, AE D, AE E)
