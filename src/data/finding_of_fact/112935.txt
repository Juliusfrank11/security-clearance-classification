Applicant had periods of unemployment before he started his current job. He also
admitted  that he  was financially  irresponsible,  and he  “gave  up  on [his]  credit.”  He did
not  file  his  2014  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  when  they  were  due.  With
penalties and interest, he owed  the IRS about $2,450 and his state about $97 for that
tax year. (Tr. at 19-27, 38-42; GE 1)
The SOR alleges the federal taxes owed for 2014; a vehicle loan that was $675

medical debts totaling $2,279; and four miscellaneous delinquent debts totaling $1,730.
Except as addressed below, the allegations are established through credit reports and
Applicant’s admissions.

Applicant stated that he paid the $69 cable television debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f.
The  debt  is  reported  by  a  collection  company  through  Experian  on  the  July  2017
combined  credit  report  with  a date  of  last  action of  June  2017.  The  debt  is listed on  a
November 2018 Equifax credit report with a date of last action of August 2014. The debt
is not listed on the March 2019 Equifax credit report nor the May 2019  Experian credit

agreement to pay $100 per month to the creditor for the $1,109 debt alleged in SOR ¶

There are four additional debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant stated that he has
attempted to contact the creditor for the $2,232 charged-off student loan alleged in SOR
¶  1.b,  but  the  creditor  has  not  been  cooperative.  That  debt  and  the  three  remaining
medical debts totaling $434 are no longer listed on Applicant’s credit report. (Tr. at 28-
29; GE 2-4; AE B-D, L)
Applicant  stated  that  his  finances  are  better  since  he  has  a  stable  job.  He  just
received a raise, which he will use to address his debts. He has a greater appreciation
of the importance of financial responsibility. He would like to buy a house within the next
two  years, and he  knows  that  maintaining  his finances  in  order is  necessary  to  do  so.
He  has  not  received  formal  financial  counseling,  but  he  has  received  advice  from  his
brother  and  his  brother’s  wife.  He  is  also  scheduled  to  take  a  training  course  from  a
realtor on what is required to buy a house. He credibly stated that he intends to pay his
debts. (Tr. at 19, 27, 29, 43, 49-50; AE L)
