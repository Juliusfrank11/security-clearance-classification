Applicant  denied  the  SOR  allegations.  He  is  a  26-year-old  recent  master’s
graduate sponsored for a clearance by a U.S. defense contractor since March 2018. He
has not previously held a clearance (Item 3).
The  SOR  alleges,  and  Item  3  establishes  ten  delinquent  debts  totaling  over
$32,000.  The  debts  comprise  a  $600  delinquent  medical  bill  (SOR  1.a),  a  $200
delinquent  utility  bill  (SOR  1.b),  and  eight  delinquent  education  loans  totaling  over
$31,000 (SOR 1.c-1.j). The eight delinquent loans reflect the delinquent balances as of
the 16 May 2018 credit report (Item 3), on original loan disbursements totaling $22,000.3
Item  3  reflects  the  eight  delinquent  loans  have  been  referred  for  collection  as  of  May
2018. However, Item  3  also reflects what appears to be a master account held by the
SOR creditor, with a $27,000 credit limit/high credit, being transferred to another lender
as being 120 days past due as of November 2011.  In addition, Item three reflects two
accounts,  with  account  numbers  different  from  both  the  master  account  and  the  SOR
accounts, held by the servicing agent for the SOR creditor, each with a $10,000 credit
limit/high  credit  and  current  balances  of  $8,511  and  $12,126,  respectively,  as  of  May
2018.  The  accounts  are  reported  as  current,  although  having been  90  days past  due.
Moreover,  although  Item  3  reports  the  master  account  and  the  SOR  accounts  as
Applicant’s  individual  responsibility,  the  servicing  agent  accounts  are  reported  as  joint
accounts.
Applicant disclosed no financial issues on his March 2018 clearance application
(Item 2). Applicant’s Answer stated, and his Response subsequently documented, that
Applicant had medical insurance for the SOR 1.a medical debt, and provided the claim
number for his dispute of that debt. Similarly, he stated, and later documented that he
first  became  aware  of  the  delinquent  SOR  1.b  utility  bill  during  a  July  2018  interview
with a Government investigator, and promptly paid the bill on 12 July 2018 (Response).
Finally, Applicant stated, and subsequently documented, that he attended college
full  time  from  September  2011  through  May  2015,  and  upon  graduating  entered  a
master’s program at the same college in September 2015, graduating from that program
in May 2016. Applicant reported his entry into the master’s program to his educational
loan  creditor,  which  should  have  gotten  his  undergraduate  loans  deferred  until  he
finished that program. Instead, his loans were defaulted and referred for collection to an
entirely  different  creditor  than  appears  on  Item  3.  Applicant  provided  an  8  February
2019  letter from  that creditor referencing Applicant’s  13  January 2018  (sic)  request  to
rehabilitate  his  defaulted  loans,  and  establishing  a  $7.00  monthly  payment.  Applicant
executed the agreement 18 February 2019. Applicant also provided a 3 April 2019 letter
from  that  creditor  showing  that  Applicant  paid  the  required  monthly  payment  for

2014, all years in which Applicant attended college full-time.

February,  March,  and  April  2019,  as  well  as  reflecting  that  larger payments  had  been
made for August and September 2017.5
Applicant also provided a 4 April 2019 letter from his mother stating that she and
her husband have undertaken to pay Applicant’s education loans. She also stated that
she  and  her  husband  were  required  to  make  payments  to  the  collection  agent  to
rehabilitate the loan while resolving the deferment issue.
Applicant  documented  no  credit  or  financial  counseling,  and  did  not  submit  a
budget.  He  provided  no  work  or  character  references,  or  evidence  of  community
involvement.
