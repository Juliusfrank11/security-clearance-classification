Applicant  is  a  55-year-old  project  manager  currently  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since April 2016. He received his associate’s degree in 1984 and his bachelor’s
degree in 2011. He and his wife married in 2004 and have two children, one of whom is
an adult. This is Applicant’s first application for a security clearance. (GX 1.)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal
tax  returns  for  2011,  2012,  and  2014  through  2016.  He  admits  this  allegation  and  his
admission is incorporated in my findings of fact.
Between 1984 and 2011, Applicant timely filed his tax returns as required. In 2011,
Applicant experienced several unusual events. He and a partner started a new company.
The nature of the business initially required Applicant and his partner to fund the company
and the day-to-day operations out-of-pocket. Applicant’s partner kept the books for the
company. Additionally, Applicant’s boat was stolen and he was required to create a loss
statement  to  file  his  taxes.  Further,  Applicant  exercised  stock  options  from  a  previous
employer. (Tr. 34-36.) Finally, Applicant moved from one state to another and rented out
his  house.  (Tr.  51.)  All  of  these  issues  complicated  Applicant’s  ability  to  secure  the
necessary information and documentation for completing his tax return  and he failed to
timely file his 2011 tax return in 2012. This failure to file in 2012, combined with increased
travel demands and Applicant’s extensive volunteering commitments with his church and
his community, snowballed and Applicant failed to timely file his 2012 tax return. He timely
filed his 2013 tax return in 2014. (Tr. 53-54; Tr. 64-69.)
Applicant began reconciling his past-due tax returns in 2015, and filed his 2011 tax
return in January 2015. (GX 3; AX D.) However, this effort was short-lived and Applicant
failed to timely file his 2014, 2015, and 2016 tax returns. Applicant does not make any
excuses  for  his  failure  to  timely  file  his  tax  returns  for  several  years,  but  he  primarily
attributes his conduct to prioritizing his work, family, and volunteer work over organizing
his  paperwork.  Additionally,  Applicant’s  tax  return  preparation  was  complicated  by  his
expenses and income from his consulting business. (Tr. 71-73; Tr. 80.)
After meeting with the investigator during his background investigation, Applicant
realized that not only was it his obligation to timely file his tax returns, but that his failure
to do so could have a negative impact on his ability to be granted a security clearance.
(Tr. 80.) He filed his 2016 tax return in April 2018 and his 2014 tax return in May 2018.
He  was  entitled  to  refunds  for  these  two  years.  Applicant  filed  his  2015  tax  return  in
October 2018 and completed paying his past-due taxes and penalties on March 5, 2019.
(GX 3; AX E.) Applicant’s most complex tax return was for 2012, which he filed in January
2019. He was initially entitled to a refund for 2012, but filed too late to receive it. (GX 3;
AX  L.)  Applicant  now  fully  understands  that  timely  filing  of  his  tax  returns  must  be  a
priority. He timely filed his 2017 and 2018 tax returns. (AX E.) Applicant will timely file all
future tax returns. He has significantly reduced his volunteering commitments, in part, to
create more time for focusing on his personal affairs. (Tr. 72.)
Applicant  is  a  committed  and  valued  employee  who  has  received  outstanding
performance evaluations. (AX A.) His coworker, in recommending Applicant for a security
clearance,  testified  that  Applicant  is  a  mentor  to  new  employees  and  is  trustworthy,
dedicated,  and  honest.  (Tr.  24-26.)  Applicant’s  neighbor  of  five  years  and  fellow
neighborhood-board member testified about Applicant’s dedication to the time-consuming
volunteer work of serving as a board member, and stated that he has a reputation of being
honest and reliable. (Tr. 29-31.) His supervisor of two years highly recommends Applicant
for a security clearance and characterizes him as trustworthy and reliable. (AX  K.) His
pastor, neighbor, and friend, who are aware of Applicant’s prior tax issues, collectively
view  Applicant  as  honest, trustworthy,  and  credible and  recommend  him for a  security
clearance. (AX B.) Applicant was remorseful, candid, and credible while testifying.
