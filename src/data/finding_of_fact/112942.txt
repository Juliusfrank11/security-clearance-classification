Applicant is 63 years old. He received a bachelor’s degree in 1980 and a master’s
degree in business administration in 1985. He has been married to his wife since 1982,
and they have an adult daughter. From 1989 until May 2016, Applicant served in the U.S.
Air Force (USAF), the USAF Reserves, and the Air Force National Guard (AFNG), and
he retired as a colonel. He also worked as a federal civil servant, for which he receives a
pension. He has worked as a part-time flight instructor for a defense contractor since June
2016.  He  currently  does  not  hold  a  security  clearance,  but  previously  held  a  security
clearance from the early 1980s until 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 9-12, 18-22)
Applicant attributes his financial issues to five work-related moves between 2007
and  2014.  During  this  period,  he  was  geographically  separated  from  his  family  and
supported  his  wife  and  daughter  in  their  primary  residence.  Starting  in  2016,  a
construction  project  on  his  vacation  home  contributed  to  his  financial  problems.
Additionally,  his  mother  was  ill  in  2018  and  2019,  which  contributed  to  his  financial
obligations. (Answer; GE 1; GE 2 at 2; AE C; Tr. 23-27, 38)
In  October  2012,  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  filed  a  $70,701  tax  lien
against Applicant.  Applicant admitted at the hearing that he learned of the lien in 2017,
when the IRS sent him a letter and garnished his pay. He did not disclose this debt in his
2017 SCA.  He claimed in his May 2018 personal subject interview that he was unaware
of  the  lien  due  his  frequent  moves,  despite  his  wife  residing  in  their  primary  and
permanent residence. (GE 2 at 2; GE 5 at 3; GE 7 at 4; Tr. 22-27, 31, 35-36)
During  his  May  2018  interview,  Applicant  also  told  the  investigator  that  he  was
working with an accountant to resolve his outstanding tax liens, and he had a quarterly
payment arrangement with the IRS. However, he admitted at the hearing that he had yet
to meet with an accountant or tax specialist. In late 2018, after the SOR was issued, he
did have a couple of phone conversations with a military financial counselor to address
his outstanding delinquent debts, but she moved to another base. Despite claims that he
anticipated that the lien would be resolved within thirty days of his March 2019 Answer to
the SOR, he had not consulted with another financial counsel. (GE 7 at 4; Tr. 27-33)
As of the hearing, Applicant had not yet contacted the IRS regarding the lien, nor
had  he  hired  an  accountant  or  tax  specialist.  He  was  unsure  which  tax  years  were
included in the lien, and he believed the tax lien might be a tax obligation for a property
he  sold  in  2011.  He  admitted  that  he  should  have  been  more  aware  of  his  financial
obligations and done more to resolve the problems. (GE 2 at 2; GE 5 at 3; GE 7 at 4; Tr.
22-23, 28-36)
At the hearing, Applicant admitted that he had not yet filed his 2018 federal and
state income tax returns, nor had he filed for an extension. Additionally, he filed his income
tax  returns  late  for  at  least  two  additional  tax  years,  but  he  did  not  remember  which
specific years were filed late. Applicant’s May 2019 credit bureau report indicated that a
credit  card  debt  and  his  car  loan  were  30  to  60  days  delinquent.  These  additional tax
issues  and  debts  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  and  they  will  not  be  considered  as
disqualifying in determining Applicant’s security worthiness. However, these facts can be
considered in determining Applicant’s mitigation, and evaluation under the whole-person
concept. (GE 3 at 2, 5; Tr. 34, 36-39)
In August 2019, a state income tax lien of $14,151 was filed against Applicant for
tax year 2017. Applicant owns his principle residence, and the mortgage for this property
is alleged in SOR allegation 1.d. He has also owned a vacation home since 1976. During
the summer of 2016, his vacation home was torn down, and Applicant built a new vacation
home. In 2017, Applicant withdrew approximately $150,000 from his Thrift Savings Plan
(TSP) account to fund the construction project at his vacation home. He did not account
for the associated tax liability for the early withdrawal, and he did not have the funds to
pay the subsequent state tax liability. (GE 6; AE C; Tr. 42-47)
Applicant has claimed that in March or April 2019, he established a $2,060 monthly
payment plan with his state to resolve the lien. At the hearing, he stated that the balance
was  $6,000,  and  in  his  post-hearing  submission  he  claimed  that  only  one  payment
remained for the lien. However, he provided no supporting documentation to demonstrate
payment or resolution. (GE 6; AE C; Tr. 42-47)
Applicant  opened  a  revolving  credit  card  account  in  June  2015,  and  it  became
delinquent in July 2018. The $4,000 credit card balance was charged off by the creditor
at an unknown date. Applicant used the credit card while he and his wife were rebuilding
their vacation home, and it became delinquent due to additional construction expenses
and  elder-related  expenses  for  his mother.  Applicant  testified  that  during  the  spring  of
2019,  he  established  a  $500  monthly  payment  plan.  He  provided  no  supporting
documentation to demonstrate payment or resolution. (GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 2; Tr. 48-49,
53-54)
The Amended SOR alleged that Applicant was $16,886 past due on his primary
home’s  mortgage,  and  the  total  outstanding  balance  was  $379,838.  Applicant  and  his
wife purchased this home in August 2007. Applicant claimed that he fell behind on the
$3,377 monthly payments in approximately June 2017, due to his military moves between
2007 and 2014, and the additional expenses associated with living separately from his
family. However, it appears based upon the record evidence that Applicant fell behind on
his mortgage payments during the remodel of his vacation home. (GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 3;
GE 5 at 5; Tr. 49, 52-54)
After making three timely payments between May and July 2019, Applicant entered
into a loan modification with the mortgage holder, effective August 1, 2019. Applicant’s
unpaid installments, interest, late charges, fees and costs, and advanced unpaid property
taxes  and  insurance  totaled  $28,591.48.  This  balance  was  rolled  into  the  outstanding
principle, with the exception of $1,702.18, which was forgiven. The new total outstanding
balance is $394,900, and the new monthly payments are almost $3,000. Applicant did not
provide proof of payments for this debt. (AE A; Tr. 16, 49-52)
Applicant  attributed  his  failure  to  timely  resolve  his  tax  obligations  and  other
delinquent debts in a timely manner to the pressure of his military positions during his last
several years of service. He recognized that he has avoided resolving his financial issues
and  instead  spent  too  much  time  doing  volunteer  work.  He  does  not  follow  a  written
budget and has not sought any significant credit counseling. (Tr. 39-40, 56, 59-61)
Applicant’s receives approximately $76,000 annually from his military pension; his
civil  service  pension  is  $32,000  annually;  and  he  earns  approximately  $65,000  a  year
from his part-time defense-contractor position. Applicant’s wife recently started working
part-time  as  a  secretary  at  a  local  school.  He  anticipated  that  this  position  would  last
between one and two months. (AE C; Tr. 11, 20-21, 56)
Applicant volunteers at his church and is actively involved within his community.
He received numerous awards and decorations related to his military service, including,
but  not  limited  to:  Legion  of  Merit  Medal;  Meritorious  Service  Medal  with  six  oak  leaf
clusters; Air Medal with two oak leaf clusters; Air Force Commendation Medal with one
oak  leaf  cluster; Air  Force  Achievement  Medal;  and Air  Force  Outstanding  Unit  Award
with seven oak leaf clusters. Applicant also served in several command level positions
during his 35 years of service in the USAF, USAF Reserves, and AFNG. (AE B; Tr. 59-
61)
