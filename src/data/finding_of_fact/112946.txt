Unless  otherwise  indicated  by  citation  to  another  part  of  the  record,  I  have
extracted the below findings of fact from Applicant’s SOR answer (Item 2) and her PTA
(Item 3).
Applicant, age 39, has one adult child and one minor child. She has never married.
She  earned  an  associate’s  degree  in  2008.  She  has  been  employed  by  a  federal
contractor  as  an  accounting  clerk  since  March  2018.  She  has  not  had  any  periods  of
unemployment during the last ten years. This is her first application for a position of trust.
Applicant admits each of the nine debts alleged in the SOR, including $4,967 for
federal taxes; $3,180 for state taxes; $20,834 for federal student loans; and $11,764 for
six credit card accounts.
Applicant established installment agreements to repay her federal taxes in 2017
and 2018. Her balance as of October 2018 was $4,731. She has made timely payments
pursuant to those agreements through March 2019. (AE A; Item 5 at 2-3, 19, 23, 24, 25,
27, and 28).
Applicant  established  a  payment  plan  to  repay  her  state  taxes  in  July  2018,  at
which time a 2014 overpayment of $307 was applied to her balance. She renewed her
payment plan in April 2019 with monthly payments of $50 to begin May 2019. Her balance
as of April 2019 was $3,424. The record does not establish that any payments have been
made pursuant to either agreement. (AE C; Item 5 at 31, 51-52).
Applicant initiated action to repay her student loans beginning with $50 monthly
payments in March 2018, which she timely paid through October 2018. In October 2018,
she  formalized  a  $50  monthly  payment  plan.  The  record  does  not  establish  that  any
payments have been made since October 2018. (Item 5 at 54 and 56).
Applicant engaged the services of a debt-relief company and established a plan to
repay her credit-card debt in March 2018. She has timely paid $252 per month pursuant
to that plan through April 2019. As of November 2018, two of the alleged debts (SOR ¶¶
1.g and 1.h) had been resolved. The record does not establish the status of the remaining
debts. (AE B; Item 5 at 57-62, and 67-68).
Applicant attributed her financial indebtedness to a period between approximately
2012  and  2018  when  her  expenses  exceeded  her  income  due  primarily  to  increased
commuting expenses, and to credit-card debt that she incurred to aid a friend in  need,
who reneged on a promise to help her repay that debt. Between 2012 and 2014, after a
relocation, Applicant experienced increased expenses associated with an extraordinarily
long  commute  for  routine  visits  with  her  children.  Between  2014  and  2015,  after  she
moved  to  the  same  town  as  her  children,  she  continued  to  experience  expenses
associated with an extraordinarily long commute to work. In 2015, she became employed
in the same town in which she and her children lived, but her income did not suffice to
meet her monthly expenses. After becoming gainfully employed in March 2018, she had
sufficient funds to address her delinquent debts. (Item 5 at 8; Item 3 at 37).
Applicant’s income is now sufficient to meet her monthly expenses, including the
payment arrangements that she established to repay her delinquent debts. She believes
that it is important to repay her debts and intends to continue making the payments that
she promised to her creditors. (Item 5 at 18-19).
