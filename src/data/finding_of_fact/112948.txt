In  Applicant’s  SOR  responses,  he  partially  admitted  and  partially  denied  the
allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  1.c,  1.e,  1.g,  1.h,  and  1.i.  (HE  5)  He  also  provided
extenuating and mitigating information. (HE 6) His admissions are accepted as findings of
fact. Applicant’s SOR responses and attached documentation are admitted into evidence.
(Tr. 16)
Applicant is a 61-year-old senior account executive for a defense contractor. (GE
1;  SOR  response)  His  resumé  provides  a  detailed  description  of  his  professional
accomplishments over from 1987 to present. (Tr. 18-20; SOR response, Tab C) He has
never  served  in  the  military.  (GE  1)  His  daughter  suffered  from  a  long-term  medical
condition which required multiple expensive hospitalizations. (Tr. 21-22; SOR response)
In 1984, he married. (GE 1) In 2013, he separated from his spouse, and in 2016, he was
divorced. (Tr. 22-23, 58, 112; SOR response) Applicant accepted responsibility for all of
the debts from their marriage including his mortgage. (Tr. 40; SOR response) His children
were born in 1987 and 1992. (Tr. 21; GE 1) He has held a security clearance for many
years. There is no evidence of a security violation.
Financial Considerations
When Applicant completed his April 13, 2017 SCA, he disclosed that he failed to
timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and
2015. (GE 1) He said he timely filed his 2017 and 2018 tax returns. (Tr. 23, 94) By the time
his hearing was held, all required tax returns were filed. (Tr. 24, 35) He promised to timely
file his future tax returns. (Tr. 37)
Applicant  attributed  his  failure  to  timely  file  his  federal  income  tax  returns  to
unemployment, medical expenses, separation from his spouse, excess family spending,
and divorce. (Tr. 97; GE 1) His spouse spent money frivolously, and this character flaw
contributed to their marital problems. (Tr. 97-98) He was unemployed from May to October
2009, and from March to June 2013. (Tr. 44, 56, 59) In 2009, he was paid for three months
of the unemployment period, and he received a severance check for about $60,000. (Tr.
44-45)
On his April 13, 2017 SCA, Applicant estimated that he owed $25,000 for tax year
2009, $25,000 for tax year 2011, and $0 for the other tax years. (GE 1) He also disclosed
that his $475,000 mortgage was delinquent, and he was attempting to resolve the debt
with  a  short  sale.  (GE  1)  He  was  working  with  an  attorney  and  intended  to  file  his  tax
returns. (GE 1) He expected that the short sale would change the amount of taxes due.
(GE 1) He disclosed that he had significant tax problems and a large delinquent mortgage
debt. (Tr. 60; GE 1) He carelessly failed to disclose that he had not filed his 2010 federal
tax return, the magnitude of his federal tax debt, his 2011 federal tax lien, and his failure
to file state tax returns for tax years 2009 to 2015. (Tr. 60) Nevertheless, his disclosures
were  sufficient  to  place  security  officials  on  notice  of  financial  considerations  security
concerns, and I do not conclude that he intended to deceive security officials of the scope
or magnitude of his financial problems. (Tr. 62-63)
Applicant’s budget indicates he has a gross monthly salary of $14,129. (Tr. 81, 111;
GE 2 at 31) He owns stocks and bonds valued at $125,000. (GE 2 at 31) He had a monthly
remainder  of  $1,683  available  to  address  his  tax  debt.  (GE  2  at  31)  He  worked  with
attorneys and an accountant on his tax issues. (Tr. 98-99)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for
tax years 2009 through 2013 as required. SOR ¶ 1.b, as amended, alleges Applicant failed
to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016 as required.
Applicant’s March 2018 Office of Personnel Management personal subject interview (OPM
PSI) indicates Applicant did not file or pay his federal income taxes from 2009 to present.
(GE  2  at  44)  He  said  the  reason  for  not  filing  the  tax  returns  was  marital  stress  and
unemployment. (GE 2 at 44) The dates of his federal income tax filings are depicted in the
tables below. He acknowledged that the IRS may dispute some of the tax returns he filed,
and he may have to refile some tax returns. (Tr. 80)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges the IRS filed a federal tax lien against Applicant in February 2011
for  $106,000.  According  to  LexisNexis,  the  federal  tax  lien  for  $106,000  was  filed  in
February 2011 in a county court. (GE 4) The LexisNexis document does not show the tax
years that were the basis of the lien. (GE 4) The lien is also indicated on his 2017 credit
report.  (GE  5  at  2-3)  Applicant  said  he  may  not  have  learned  about  the  lien  in  2011
because  he  was  not  opening  the  letters  he  received  from  the  IRS  because  his  entire
financial  life  was  a  “disaster”  at  that  time.  (Tr.  89)  Applicant’s  March  2018  OPM  PSI
indicates the source of the $106,000 tax lien may be unpaid taxes for tax years 2006 and
2007. (Tr. 46-48, 52-53; GE 2 at 48) He was unable to locate documents showing he filed
his  2006  and  2007  tax  returns.  (Tr.  31-32,  49-51)  He  was  unsure  about  the  tax  years
represented in the 2011 tax lien. (Tr. 100) In August 2019, the IRS issued a Certificate of
Discharge of Property from Federal Tax Lien. (AE I) The IRS discharge states:
The  United  States’  interest  in  the  above  described  property  under  the
referenced lien is now valueless. Therefore, under Section 6325(b)(2)(B) of
the Internal Revenue Code, the Internal Revenue Service discharges the
above described property from the lien. However, the lien remains in effect
for all other property, or rights to property, to which the lien is attached.
(AE I) On April 25, 2019, an IRS representative wrote Applicant and advised him that he
would issue the Certificate of Discharge once it was established that Applicant had been
divested of all rights in the property. (SOR response) Applicant said his accountant told
him that the lien was discharged because the IRS was pleased about Applicant’s progress
resolving  his  tax  issues.  (Tr.  32-33)  Applicant  made  a  $30,000  payment  to  the  IRS  in
October 2017. (Tr. 53, 64)
The IRS generally has 10 years to collect a debt. After that time has passed, the
IRS can no longer legally enforce collection of the debt. The 10-year period is measured
from the date that the tax was assessed, not when it was originally due. The 10-year clock
does  not  start  running  until  the  tax  return  is  filed.  If  the  IRS  files  a  tax  return  then  the
statute  of  limitations  began  running  whenever  that  assessment  was  processed  by  the
IRS. Before the statute of limitations is applied, tolling must also be assessed. Applicant
has not established that the statute of limitations applies to the $106,000 tax debt, which
is the source of the 2011 tax lien. The lien on Applicant’s residence is resolved otherwise
he would not have been able to transfer it back to the mortgage holder. See SOR ¶ 1.j,
infra.  However, based on the IRS’ statement on the lien certificate itself, Applicant has
not proven that the underlying tax debt is resolved. (Tr. 72-73, 100, 107-111)
SOR ¶ 1.d, as amended, alleges Applicant is indebted to the federal government
for $40,000 for tax year 2015. The IRS assessed a $40,000 debt when the IRS generated
a  substitute  tax  return.  When  Applicant  filed  his federal  income  tax  return  for  tax  year
2015, he paid the tax of less than $500. The IRS lost his tax return but cashed the check
he sent in with his tax return. (Tr. 104) He refiled his tax return for tax year 2015. (Tr. 104)
SOR  ¶  1.d  is  mitigated.  SOR  ¶  1.e,  as  amended,  alleges  Applicant  is  indebted  to  the
federal government for $47,000 for tax year 2016. When Applicant filed his federal income
tax return for tax year 2016, he concluded he owed $32,000 for that tax year. SOR ¶ 1.e
is not resolved.
The  IRS  represented  in  March  25,  2019  tax  transcripts  that  Applicant  owed  the
following federal income tax debts based on the IRS’ generation of a substitute tax return:

SOR ¶ 1.g, as amended, alleges Applicant failed to timely file his state B income
tax returns for tax years 2009 through 2013 as required. He admitted he did not timely file
tax returns for those five years. (Tr. 80) The dates Applicant filed his state B income tax
returns are depicted on the following table.  The dates on his tax returns were the dates
he signed and mailed them to tax authorities. (Tr. 78; AE H, AE I) Applicant provided the

SOR ¶ 1.h alleges Applicant failed to timely file his state M income tax returns for
tax years 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 as required. Applicant lived in state M, and he did
not file state M tax returns because he honestly believed he was a resident of state B.
(Tr. 78-79) His driver’s license was in state B, and he voted in state B. The home that was
pending foreclosure as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j was in state B. In October 2018, Applicant
filed a state M income tax return for tax year 2017. (SOR response, Tab K) He said he
timely filed his 2017 and 2018 tax returns. (Tr. 23)
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges Applicant owes state income taxes to state M for $2,000 for tax
year 2016. On December 4, 2018, Applicant paid the state tax debt, and it is resolved.
(SOR response, Tab J)
SOR ¶ 1.j alleges Applicant has a mortgage account past due in the amount of
$107,000  with  a  total  loan  balance  of  $474,000.  In  2013,  Applicant  and  his  spouse
separated.  (Tr.  55)  Applicant  and  his  spouse  were  unemployed.  (Tr.  28)  In  2005,
Applicant  purchased  a  residence  for  $635,000.  (Tr.  81)  His  primary  mortgage  was  for
$500,000, and his secondary mortgage was for $125,000. (Tr. 82) In May 2013, Applicant
moved  out  of  his  residence,  and  in  December  2013,  Applicant  stopped  paying  his
mortgage. (Tr. 56-57, 112) His spouse was unemployed outside her home. (Tr. 112) He
paid spousal support of about $5,000 monthly, and he expected her to pay the mortgage
out of her $5,000 monthly payment. (Tr. 112-113) In early 2015, she moved out, and the
residence was unoccupied for the next four years. (Tr. 113) Applicant attempted to obtain
a short sale; however, he was unsuccessful either because the mortgage company was
unwilling  to  accept  the  resolution  or  the  IRS  was  unwilling  to  release  the  lien  without
payment,  or  both.  (Tr.  114-118)  Applicant  also  attempted  to  renegotiate  the  mortgage
payment  through  a  mortgage  modification.  (Tr.  28-29)  Applicant  sued  the  mortgage
company alleging the mortgage company violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act when the
mortgage company reported the foreclosure to credit reporting companies. (Tr. 29, 113-
114) The mortgage company paid the real estate taxes on the property from December
2013 to July 2019. (Tr. 115) In July 2019, the mortgage account holder agreed to accept
a deed in lieu of foreclosure. (Tr. 29, 85; AE E; AE F) The mortgage holder paid $5,000
towards Applicant’s attorney fees in settlement of the dispute. (Tr. 29; AE G) In July 2019,
the mortgage debt was resolved. (Tr. 29-30, 106)
In  sum,  Applicant  filed  and  paid  all  of  his  state  income  taxes.  (Tr.  105-106)  He
estimates his federal tax debt is $71,000 after filing his tax returns, not including penalties
and interest. (Tr. 24-26, 76, 91-92) Applicant believes the IRS will waive the penalties.
(Tr.  91)  He  was  unable  to  afford  the  payment  plan  the  IRS  suggested  because  they
assumed he owed $200,000 or $300,000, as indicated on the table on page 5, and the
IRS  wanted  an  initial  payment  of  $100,000.  (Tr.  104-105)  Based  on  his  accountant’s
recommendation, he decided to wait for the IRS to assess his new tax debt after he filed
his tax returns. (Tr. 105) Applicant assured that he intends to pay a substantial amount to
address his federal tax debt after the IRS confirms the amount of his tax debt. (Tr. 27,
101) After making the substantial initial payment to the IRS, he intends to make $1,000
monthly payments until his federal income tax debt is paid. (Tr. 27) He hopes to have an
established payment plan with the IRS by the end of 2019. (Tr. 34-35)
Character Evidence
Applicant described himself as an honest person who was accepted responsibility
for his financial issues. (Tr. 119) He promised to be financially responsible in the future.
(Tr. 119-120) He emphasized his history of support to the Department of Defense and his
conscientious compliance with security requirements.
A  close  friend  of  10  years  described  Applicant  as  reliable,  conscientious,  and
trustworthy.  (SOR  response,  Tab  D)  A  former  coworker  and  friend  of  15  years  lauded
Applicant’s  integrity,  professionalism,  and  trustworthiness.  (SOR  response,  Tab  D)
Applicant’s  2019  performance  review  detailed  his  contributions  to  his  employer  and
outstanding performance. (SOR response, Tab E)
