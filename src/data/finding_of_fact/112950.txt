In  her  SOR  response,  Applicant  admitted  13  of  the  14  SOR  allegations  with
explanations.  She  denied  one  allegation  because  it  alleges  a  duplicate  debt.  I  have
incorporated  her  admissions  in  my  findings  of  fact.  Applicant’s  personal  information  is
extracted  from  GE  1,  her  security  clearance  application,  dated  September  11,  2017,
(SCA)  unless  otherwise  indicated  by  a  parenthetical  citation  to  the  record.  After  a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony at the hearing, and
the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant, 49, has worked as a software engineer for a defense contractor since
2017. She was born in a foreign country, entered the United States with her family as a
child, and became a U.S. citizen at the age of 19. She earned a bachelor’s of science
degree in 1992. She has worked as a technical engineer or support analyst since then.
She submitted her SCA in connection with her current employment. She is a first-time
applicant.
In 1995, Applicant married, and she and her husband had two children, ages 16
and  9.  In  2011,  her  financial  situation  became  unstable.  In  March  of  that  year,  her
husband lost his job, and in June, she was unemployed for about five months. Their home
had a nearly $800,000 mortgage with a monthly payment of $3,798. Their ability to pay
their mortgage and their significant amount of credit-card debt became a serious problem.
Her  husband  withdrew  significant  amounts  from  his  401K  retirement  accounts  and
incurred a substantial tax liability. Applicant claims that much of her credit-card debt was
incurred during the medical treatment of her oldest child, who was diagnosed with serious
illnesses as an infant and then again a few years later. She also attributes the financial
hardships she and her husband have experienced to his loss of a business he started in
2007 and closed in 2009 due to the economic recession at that time and to his ongoing
periods of unemployment until sometime after 2014. In April of 2012, they were able to
sell  their  residence  in  a  short  sale  for  $680,000,  and  the  mortgage  lender forgave  the
remaining debt. (App. Ex B at 3-5, 7-8, 10, Ex. E; Tr. 34-35, 80.)
Applicant  separated from her husband  in  December 2012, and  they  divorced  in
June 2014. Their separation was due, at least in part, to the financial problems they were
experiencing.  She  and  her  ex-husband  agreed  to  share  joint  custody  of  the  children.
Under their marital settlement agreement (the 2014 Agreement), which was incorporated
into  their  court-approved  judgment  of  dissolution,  Applicant  was  required  to  pay  her
husband $1,000 per month of child support and provide health-care insurance for their
children. She was also obligated to pay all of the uninsured healthcare expenses of the
children. Both parties agreed to waive any spousal support payments and any interest in
the other’s retirement accounts. (AE B at 2, 7-8, 13.)
At  the  time  of  their  divorce,  the  couple  had  significant  outstanding  tax  and
consumer-credit debts from 2011. They divided their tax debt for 2011 evenly between
them,  and  they  split  the  other  debts.  Several  of  the  debts  Applicant  assumed  are  the
subjects of the allegations in the SOR. Two of the debts assumed by her ex-husband are
also alleged in the SOR. In the 2014 Agreement, the parties acknowledged that if one of
them does not pay a debt assign to him or her, the creditor can collect the entire debt
from the other party. The only remedy for the party who pays the debt of the other is to
petition the court for reimbursement. (AE B at 2, 7-8, 13, 26; Tr. 15-17, 22-24, 26, 69.)
In a letter dated April 2, 2019, about 12 days after Applicant received the SOR,
Applicant’s ex-husband wrote that he had agreed to assume full responsibility for eight of
Applicant’s consumer debts and one-half of their joint federal tax liability for 2011. He was
unemployed at the time he wrote this letter. She obtained this letter from her ex-husband
at the suggestion of her attorney. The eight debts are all of Applicant’s unpaid consumer
debts alleged in the SOR, taking into account a duplicate alleged debt (SOR ¶¶ 1.i and
1.n.), specifically SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n. Applicant believed that
the 2014 Agreement was unfair because she waived her right to alimony. She believes
that this subsequent agreement (the Modification) made their divorce fairer. She testified
that  at  the  same  time  the  parties  entered  into  the  Modification,  her  ex-husband  also
agreed that she no longer needed to pay him child support, though the letter confirming
the prior oral Modification makes no mention of child support. She further testified that the
Modification was made a year or two after the 2014 divorce. It has never been formally
approved by a court. (AE C; Tr. 56, 58-60.)
The  record  contains  no  evidence  that  Applicant’s  ex-husband  has  made  any
payments to any creditor, including the IRS, under the Modification. Applicant is unaware
if her ex-husband is employed at this time. He had been working in State 1 until July 2018
and then he returned to live with Applicant in State 2. That did not work out, and he moved
to an unknown location near her residence so that he can jointly share custody of their
children  with  Applicant.  Moreover,  she  testified  that  she  has  not  asked  him  if  he  was
actually  paying  her  debts  and  his  share  of  their  2011  federal  taxes  pursuant  to  the
Modification. Also, she provided no documentation evidencing any payments of the debts.
She  acknowledges  that  his  commitment  to  pay  these  debts  does  not  absolve  her  of
responsibility for the debts. She is aware that her ex-husband is trying to clean up his
credit, which raises the possibility that he is only taking care of his personal debts. The
age of the debts are such that they may no longer be enforceable by the creditors under
the applicable state statutes of limitations. This raises a concern as to whether Applicant’s
ex-husband undertook responsibility for the debts with any intent to pay them. (Tr. 29-31,
37, 55-57, 63-65; AE C.)
Notwithstanding  the  Modification,  Applicant  listed  most  of  the  SOR  debts  in  her
September 2017 SCA as her debts. Specifically, the tax debts alleged at SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d
and eight of the consumer debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n.
She did not list the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g, a judgment obtained by a bank on a credit-
card account, which was listed in both the 2014 Agreement and the Modification as a debt
for  which  her  ex-husband  was  responsible.  She  also  stated  in  her  November  2017
background  interview  that  a  number  of  the  SOR  debts  belonged  to  her  and  that  she
intended to pay them. (GE 1 at 51-62; GE 3 at 7-13.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d – IRS tax debts and lien for 2011 and 2012 totaling $62,098.
Applicant  and  her  then-husband  jointly  filed  their  2011  federal  tax  return  in  a  timely
manner. Their  combined  income  was  almost  $200,000.  Their  total  withholding  for  that
year was only $698, which resulted in a tax liability of $52,318, plus penalties and interest.
Applicant testified that the tax debt for 2011 was due to distributions from her husband’s
401K retirement account. In March 2014, the IRS filed a tax lien against both Applicant
and her ex-husband for 2011 in the amount of $53,852. At one point, the IRS froze her
bank account, apparently as a garnishment to collect her delinquent taxes. Applicant was
unable to pay this tax debt for years because she had insufficient income. In 2017, the
IRS  determined  that  this  tax  debt  was  uncollectible  and  agreed  to  review  the  couple’s
financial situation annually. Applicant contacted the IRS in 2018 and again in January and
March 2019 about her tax debt. They advised her to begin making monthly payments in
March 2019 and that the IRS would review her situation further. On May 25, 2019, the
IRS documented an installment agreement under which she will pay it $200 per month.
She  also  provided  copies  of  check  payments  for the months of  March,  April,  and  May
2019.  Since  then,  the  monthly  payments  have  been  automatically  withdrawn  from  her
account.  She acknowledges  that  if  her husband  pays  no  taxes under the  Modification,
she  will  be  liable  for  the  entire  amount.  She  has  not  discussed  with  her  ex-husband
whether he is paying the IRS anything on their joint tax debt. (GE 6, 7; AE A, J; Tr. 35-
36, 38, 70-71, 76-78.)
Due to their separation in late 2011, Applicant filed her 2012 federal return as head
of household. She had income of about $73,000 and withholding of only $2,834, resulting
in a tax liability of $8,214, plus penalties and interest. In their 2014 Agreement, the couple
agreed  to  divide  their  federal  tax  liability  equally.  Presumably,  this  2012  tax  debt  was
included in that arrangement. The Modification makes no mention of Applicant’s 2012 tax
debt. Applicant’s tax transcripts in the record reflect that she over withheld about $2,000
per  year  for  the  years  2013  through  2017,  and  that  the  IRS  applied  these  excess
payments to her 2011 joint tax liability with her ex-husband. (GE 2 at 18-21; Tr. 26.)
Applicant and her ex-husband also owed about $10,000 in state taxes for 2011.
During a period in 2018 when her ex-husband was working in State 1, they jointly paid off
their  delinquent  tax  obligations  to  State  2.  The  SOR  contains  no  allegation  regarding
delinquent state taxes. (Tr. 66, 83.)
SOR  ¶  1.e  –  Judgment  in  the  amount  of  $4,406  obtained  by  a  collection
agency  on  a  bank  credit-card  account.  Applicant  defaulted  on  this  credit  card  in  or
about January 2011. She entered into a payment plan to pay this judgment in July 2017.
She paid off the debt in 2018. This debt is resolved in Applicant’s favor. (GE 1 at 52, GE
2 at 12, 16.)
SOR  ¶  1.f  –  Judgment  obtained  in  July  2014  by  a  bank  on  a  credit  card
account.  Applicant  and  her  ex-husband  had  two  credit  card  accounts  with  this  card
issuer. In 2011, she defaulted on the account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f with a debt of about
$5,000. In her SCA, she reported the debt on the judgment to be about $17,000. Under
the 2014 Agreement, each party assumed responsibility for one of these debts, but the
dollar amounts of each debt is not stated. Applicant now denies responsibility for this debt
because she believes her husband agreed to pay it in the Modification. (Tr. 39-42; GE 1
at 55.)
SOR ¶ 1.g – Judgment obtained in January 2013 by a bank on a credit card
account. Applicant defaulted on this account in about 2011 with a debt of about $5,000.
Under  the  2014  Agreement,  Applicant’s  ex-husband  assumed  responsibility  for  this
judgment. Applicant denies responsibility for this debt because she believes her husband
agreed to pay it, both in the 2014 Agreement and in the Modification. This debt is resolved
in Applicant’s favor. (Tr. 41.)
SOR ¶ 1.h – Credit-card account owed to a credit union that was charged off
in the amount of $7,638. According to her notation in her SCA, Applicant defaulted on
this credit card in 2015. She testified that she defaulted on the debt in 2011. This debt is
listed as an obligation of her ex-husband in the 2014 Agreement. This debt is also listed
in the Modification as an obligation of Applicant’s ex-husband. This debt is resolved in
Applicant’s favor. (Tr. 43; GE 1 at 61-62; GE 2 at 13, 17; GE 3 at 5; AE B, C.)
SOR  ¶  1.i  –  Defaulted  bank  loan  owed  in  the  amount  of  $1,427.  Applicant
defaulted on this loan about the time of the 2014 Agreement. The debt is not allocated to
either party in the 2014 Agreement. Applicant listed the debt as her obligation in her 2017
SCA. In her background interview, she described the debt as an overdraft on her bank
account. She now claims that her ex-husband has assumed responsibility for this debt,
as reflected in the Modification. She has no knowledge as to whether he has paid or is
paying this debt. (GE 1 at 61-62; GE 2 at 13; Tr. 44-45.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.j and 1.k – Credit-card accounts placed for collection in the amount
of $33,336 and $2,377, respectively. In 2005, Applicant and her husband opened these
accounts  with  the  issuer.  She  testified  that  most  of  the  expenses  incurred  on  these
accounts  were  related  to  their  expenses  in  2004  and  2007  caring  for  their  seriously  ill
child. She defaulted on the accounts in 2011. The 2014 Agreement provides for these
debts to be obligations of Applicant. She now claims that her husband has assumed these
liabilities under the Modification. She has no knowledge as to whether he has paid or is
paying this debt. (Tr. 46-47; GE 1 at 57; GE 2 at 13, 16; GE 3 at 4, 5; AE B, C.)
SOR ¶ 1.l – Credit-card account placed for collection in the amount of $785.
This account was jointly opened in 1999 by Applicant and her then-husband. Applicant
defaulted on it in 2011. The debt is not listed in the 2014 Agreement. It is listed as a debt
Applicant’s ex-husband assumed in the Modification. (AE B, C; GE 1 at 56; GE 2 at 13,
16; GE 3 at 5.
SOR  ¶  1.m  –  Credit-card  account  placed  for  collection  in  the  amount  of
$8,034. Applicant and her then-husband jointly opened this account. They defaulted on it
in 2011. In the 2014 Agreement, the debt is listed as an obligation of Applicant, however,
Applicant claims that under the Modification, her ex-husband assumed responsibility for
the debt. She has no knowledge as to whether he has paid or is paying this debt. (Tr. 47-
48; GE 1 at 54-55; GE 2 at 12, 16; AE B, C.)
SOR  ¶  1.n  –  Defaulted  bank  loan  owed  in  the  amount  of  $998.  Applicant
presented  evidence  that  this  debt  is  a  duplicate  of  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.i.  The
creditors alleged in the two SOR subparagraphs merged in February 2018. This allegation
is resolved in Applicant’s favor. (AE E; Tr. 45-46, 64-65.)
Applicant current finances are sound. She earns a significant income and spends
responsibly. She has three retirement accounts worth about $100,000. Since 2017, she
has accrued about $25,000 in the retirement account held by her current employer. She
has created and uses a budget and testified that she has received credit counseling. She
does not presently have any credit-card accounts and has no new debts. (AE F at 13-14,
17; Tr. 85.)
Applicant presented a number of character reference letters. They describe her as
a dedicated, hard-working, and respected co-worker. She is also described as an ethical
person with high moral character. Her references recommend her for a security clearance
because of her reliability and integrity. She also submitted her employer’s performance
evaluations for 2017 and 2018 in which she was praised for her strong performance and
work ethic. She has received multiple awards and considers herself to be an exemplary
employee. (AE G, H; Tr. 19-20.)
