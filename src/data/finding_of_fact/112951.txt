Applicant admitted both of the SOR allegations. He is 53 years old. He is married
and he has two adult children. He has owned his home since 2006. (Items 3-4).
Applicant graduated from high school in 1984. He earned a bachelor’s degree in
1990. He was unemployed from January to March 2012 and January to June 2016, and
self-employed from approximately November 2005 to December 2012. As of his March
2017  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  he  worked  as  an  engineer  for  a  DOD
contractor since June 2016. He has never held a DOD security clearance. (Items 4-5).
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  failed  to  file  his  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns for tax years 2010 and 2011, as required. He listed and discussed his failure to
file his 2010 and 2011 federal and state income tax returns on his 2017 SCA, during his
April and June 2018 interviews with a background investigator, and in his January 2019
response to interrogatories. (Items 1, 3-6).
Applicant attributed his failure to file his relevant income tax returns to the sale of
his failing business in December 2011. He was overwhelmed with the associated record
keeping  and  he  was  unable  to  provide  his  certified  public  accountant  (CPA)  with  the
information  necessary  to  timely  file  his  relevant  tax  returns.  IRS  account  transcripts
reflect that he was granted until October 2011 and October 2012, respectively, to file his
2010 and 2011 federal income tax returns, but he failed to do so. He indicated that he
paid  his  income  taxes  quarterly  then  so  he  did  not  believe  he  owed  any  taxes,  but
acknowledged  that  he  potentially  faced  penalties  for  failing  to  timely  file.  He  also
indicated that he was working with his CPA to resolve his unfiled tax returns. (Items 4-6;
AE A).
In  his  January  2019  response  to  interrogatories,  Applicant  stated  that  he  timely
filed his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2017. He stated
that  he  did  not  owe  any  federal  taxes  for  tax  years  2012  through  2016  and  he  paid
$4,266  in  federal  taxes  that  he  owed  for  tax  year  2017.  He  provided  copies  of  IRS
account  transcripts  for  tax  periods  2012  through  2017  to  corroborate  his  claim.  He
stated that he did not owe any state taxes for tax years 2012 to 2013, and he paid $351,
$242, $1,280, and $1,975 in state taxes that he owed for tax years 2014 through 2017,
respectively.  He  stated  that  he  understood  the  importance  of  filing  his  unfiled  tax
returns,  and  he  hoped  his  “demonstrated  tax  conformance  since  2012”  and  his
“willingness to correct” his unfiled returns would be considered. (Item 6).
Applicant  filed  his  2010  and  2011  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  in  May
2019.  His  2010  and  2011  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  reflect  that  he  is  due
federal  refunds  of  $3,374  and  $621,  and  state  refunds  of  $607  and  $76,  respectively.
He acknowledged that it was irresponsible of him to fail to timely file these relevant tax
returns and he should have corrected his failure sooner. He cited to his timely filing of
his federal and state tax returns for tax years prior to 2010 and subsequent to 2011 as
evidence of his tax compliance. (AE A).
