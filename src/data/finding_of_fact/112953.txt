Applicant admitted all the allegations, except SOR ¶ 1.j, with some explanation.
The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings
and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  48  years  old.  He  has  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  since  June
2016. From December 2014 to May 2016, he worked as a DOD civilian employee. He
worked for federal contractors from 2012 to 2014. He experienced unemployment from
August  to  December  2011.  He  served  honorably  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  for  21  years,
retiring in August 2011 in the grade of master sergeant (E-7). He is a college graduate.
He is divorced (married from 1991 to 2007) and has three adult children. (Tr. 6, 18-20;
GE 1)
The SOR alleged Applicant owed the Federal Government for delinquent taxes in
the  amount  of  approximately  $1,625  for  tax  year  2017  and  approximately  $771  for
unnamed tax years. It also alleged he owed on  eight collection, charged off, and past-
due  accounts  totaling  approximately  $20,201.  Applicant  admitted  in  his  October  2017
security  clearance  application  (SCA),  in  his  January  2019  statement  to  a  defense
investigator,  and  in  his  answer  to  the  SOR  that  he  failed  to  pay  his  2015  and  2017
federal  income  taxes.  Credit  reports from  December  2017,  June  2018,  and  May  2019
support the remaining delinquent debts. (GE 1, 3, 5-7)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  problems  dating  back  to  2007.  He  claimed
those  past  situations  were  caused  by  his  divorce  in  2007.  Concerning  the  financial
problems  outlined  in  the  SOR,  Applicant  attributes  his  difficulties  to  making  a  poor
financial decision in 2014 when he bought an expensive car requiring monthly payments
of  approximately  $1,100.  He  also  admitted  spending  money  on  his  girlfriend,  which
would have been better served paying his debts. He noted that he paid back a debt to
the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  of  approximately  $7,000  when  he  failed  two
courses for which his GI Bill paid. He also claimed that his income was reduced during
this  time,  and  that  he  assumed  the  expenses  associated  with  his  mother’s  death  and
funeral. No documentation supports these assertions. He provided no proof of seeking
financial counseling. (Tr. 22, 24, 33-34, 42)
The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b (federal tax debt)-$1,625 and $771. Applicant owes these
amounts for the tax years 2015 and 2017. He claims he contacted the IRS to set up a
payment  plan  online,  but  because  his  account  has  a  freeze  code,  he  was  unable  to
complete the transaction. He documented his IRS online history showing his logins from
April  18,  2016,  two  on  July  16,  2019,  and  two  from  September  20,  2019.  He  also
documented  that  on  September  20,  2019,  he  was  unable  to  complete  an  online
payment  transaction.  Applicant  was  given  in  excess  of  60  days  after  the  hearing  to
show  his  actions  to  resolve  these  debts.  He  failed  to  document  any  payment
agreements  with  the  IRS  or  proof  of  payments  toward  the  debts.  These  debts  are
unresolved. (Tr. 23-26; GE 3; AE D)
SOR  ¶  1.c  (utility  debt)-$297.  Applicant  claimed  this debt  was  for  a  utility  at  a
former  residence.  He  claimed  he  called  them.  He  failed  to  document  any  payment
agreements or payments made. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 27; GE 6)
SOR  ¶  1.d  (auto  debt)-$1,638  (balance  of  $36,632).  This  is  the  car  debt  from
2014.  Applicant  is  behind  on  his  payments.  He  failed  to  document  any  payment
agreements or payments made. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 29; AE 3)
SOR  ¶  1.e  (consumer  debt)-$5,779.  Applicant  admitted  this  debt  and  claimed
that the creditors wished to settle with him, but he did not have the funds to do so. This
debt is unresolved. (Tr. 28; GE 6)
SOR  ¶  1.f  (consumer  debt)-$3,275.  Applicant  admitted  this  debt  and  claimed
that the creditors wished to settle with him, but he did not have the funds to do so. This
debt is unresolved. (Tr. 28; GE 6)
SOR  ¶  1.g  (mortgage  payment)-$4,817  (balance  of  $255,850).  Applicant
admitted  that  he  was  behind  on  his  home-mortgage  payments.  He  claimed  his  credit
union is working with him and he adds extra funds when he can to his regular monthly
payments. He failed to provide any supporting documentation. This debt is  unresolved.
(Tr. 30; GE 6)
SOR  ¶  1.h  (consumer  debt)-$432.  Applicant  admitted  this  debt.  He  failed  to
produce  evidence  of  payments  or  a  payment  plan.  This  debt  is  unresolved.  (SOR
Answer; GE 6)
SOR ¶ 1.i (medical debt)-$219. Applicant admitted this  was a medical debt for
his daughter that his ex-wife was to pay. He failed to produce evidence of payments or
a  payment  plan  or  anything  documenting  his  ex-wife’s  responsibility  for  the  debt.  This
debt is unresolved. (Tr. 27-28; GE 6)
SOR  ¶  1.j  (student  loans)-$3,744  Applicant  did  not  recognize  this  debt.  He
contacted  the  school where  he  received  his  bachelor’s  degree  and  it  provided  a  letter
stating that Applicant had no outstanding financial aid accounts, including student loans.
This debt is resolved. (Tr. 32; AE B)
Applicant produced two character letters from his supervisor and a Navy officer.
Both describe Applicant as trustworthy and reliable. They recommend that he receive a
security clearance. (AEC).
