Applicant admitted the sole allegation in the SOR (¶ 1.a) with an explanation, and
his admission and explanation are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 53 years old. He and his wife have been married for almost 30 years.
They have three grown children. Applicant graduated from high school in 1985. He has
taken some college courses, but has not earned a degree. He served on active duty in
the  United  States  Air  Force  for  24  years, from  September 1986  to  October 2010,  and
was honorably discharged as a master sergeant (E-7). He worked briefly in the defense
industry before entering federal civil service in March 2011. (GE 1; Tr. 30-31)
In  2016,  Applicant  began  his  current  job  as  a  technician  with  a  defense
contractor  and  clearance  sponsor.  He  works  on  an  air  force  base  as  a  technician.  He
has held a security clearance for over 30 years, and is seeking to renew it. (Tr. 24, 37)
During  the  2010  tax  year,  Applicant  was  deployed  overseas.  His  son  was  in
college.  Applicant  initially  did  not  list  his  son  as  a  dependent  on  his  federal  tax  return
because his son initially intended to file his own tax return. His son later determined that
he  did  not  make  enough  income  to  do  that.  Applicant  did  not  file  his  2010  tax  return.
(SCA; Tr. 20-22, 31-32)
Applicant  disclosed  on  his  October  2016  SCA  that  his  2010  federal  income  tax
return  remained  unfiled.  In  his  September  2017  background  interview,  he  voluntarily
disclosed that his 2016 federal income tax return was also unfiled. Applicant explained
that he used a nationally known tax preparation software program to prepare and file his
2016 federal return. He thought he had done so in a timely way, but he was notified by
the  software  program  that  the  return  had  not  been  accepted  by  the  IRS.  (GE  2)  The
returns  were  also  unfiled  at  the  time  Applicant  responded  to  a  November  2017  tax
interrogatory from DOD CAF. (GE 3)
At  his  hearing,  Applicant  documented  that  he  filed  his  2016  federal  return  in
January  2019,  and  received  a  small  refund.  He  documented  that  he  filed  his  2010
federal  return  in  April 2019.  He  apparently  would  have  received  an  $800  refund  if  the
return  had  not  been  so  untimely.  He  does  not  owe  any  money  to  the  IRS  in  past-due
taxes. (AE A)
Applicant testified that by the time he revised his 2010 federal return after his son
decided not to file his own return, the filing deadline had passed. He initially intended to
send it in the next year (April 2012) but did not do so because by then he could not find
all the relevant paperwork. He acknowledged that he did not do so out of laziness, and
did not file, figuring that he would just forgo any refund he was due. (Tr. 20-22)
As to his 2016 return, Applicant testified that after he moved to his new state, he
had difficulty preparing his return when he and his wife were living in different states. He
prepared  his  return  through  the  tax  preparation  software  system,  put  in  certain  data
from his prior year’s tax return, but “it got kicked back saying it was the wrong number.”
(Tr. 24) He  said  the  same thing  happened even  after he  contacted  the IRS  for  proper
information.  He  said  he  intended  to  file  his  2016  return  along  with  his 2017  return  but
did not do so, again because of laziness. (Tr. 24-25)
AE A includes account transcripts for several tax years, including 2010 (alleged),
2012-2015  and  2018  (all filed  on  time),  and  2016  (alleged).  The  account  transcript  for
2017 is also included. It shows that Applicant also filed his 2017 federal tax return late,
in April 2019. (AE A) This additional late-filed tax return is not alleged in the SOR, but
may be considered in weighing mitigation.
Applicant  acknowledged  that  receiving  the  SOR  was  what  spurred  him  to
address  his  unfiled  returns.  He  testified  that  he  was  not  more  prompt  in  doing  so,  in
part, because “I just put it off and I put it off.” (Tr. 23) In 2016, he moved to his current
home state for his current job, and all his important papers were at his home, in another
state on the other side of the country,  which impacted his ability to prepare his return.
(Tr. 23-24)
Applicant acknowledged his errors in  judgment  in not filing  his  tax  returns more
promptly. He accepted full responsibility and said the only reason he did not file his tax
returns  is  because  he  did  not  owe  any  taxes,  and  expected  to  get  a  refund.  His  view
was, “if I don’t get the money from them, then no harm done.” (Tr. 26) He said if the tax
preparation  software had  indicated  that he  owed  taxes,  he  would have filed  them.  (Tr.
35)
Applicant now has a greater understanding of the importance of filing a tax return
on  time  as  required,  particularly  for  those  who  seek  eligibility  for  access  to  classified
information  by  the  federal  government.  He  testified  that  he  was  remorseful and  said  it
will  never  let  this  happen  again.  (Tr.  26,  29,  37-38)  All  subsequent  federal tax  returns
have been filed. (AE A; Tr. 29). He lives in a state that has no state income tax, so filing
a state income tax return is not required. (Tr. 38)
Applicant  loves  his  job,  which  is  working  on  aircraft  on  an  air  force  base.  He
says, “It’s all I know how to do and it’s all I want to do, and I would love to do it another
10, 15 years.” (Tr. 26)
