Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  financial  allegation.  He  is  a  37-year-old  canine
handler  employed  by  a  U.S.  defense  contractor  since  July  2016  (Item  4).  He  served
honorably in the U.S. military from March 2001 to July 2014, when he was discharged in
paygrade  E-6.  He  seeks  to  retain  the  clearance  which  was  most  recently  renewed  in
July 2014 (Item 3).
Applicant  married  his  first  wife  in  May  2003.  Their  first  child  was  born  in
September 2003; their second child was born in June 2005. They divorced in May 2011.
He  remarried  in  November  2011.  He  and  his  second  wife  have  two  children,  born  in
November 2012 and March 2015. Applicant’s second wife also remarried, although the
date of that marriage does not appear in the record.
As part of Applicant’s May 2011 divorce, the court issued an Income Deduction
Order that required Applicant’s present or subsequent employers to withhold $1,281.38
monthly from Applicant’s pay until Applicant’s oldest child reached age 18 in 2021, and
a lesser amount until  his second child reached age 18 (Answer). The military withheld
the require child support until Applicant’s July 2014 discharge.
Sometime before April 2012. Applicant’s ex-wife and her new husband proposed
to  Applicant—for  a  variety  of  reasons  not  relevant  to  this  decision—that  the  new
husband adopt Applicant’s two children with his  first wife. One expected consequence
of the adoption would be to end Applicant’s child support obligation. Applicant agreed to
the adoptions, signed the adoption papers (but did not keep copies of them), and as of
January  2013,  had  not  received  copies  of  the  final  adoption  orders.  The  military
withholding  of  the  child  support  ended  with  Applicant’s  July  2014  discharge.  After  his
discharge, Applicant had difficulty finding new employment, and experienced periods of
unemployment. However, when he did  have  employment, he did not  provide the  child
support  order  to  the  new  employer,  erroneously  thinking  that  the  adoptions  had  been
completed (Item 4).
Applicant asserts that he was unaware of his child support arrears until he was
confronted  with  them  by  a  Government  investigator  during  an  August  2018  interview
(Item 4). Nevertheless, he told the investigator that he would act to address the arrears.
However,  while  Applicant’s  5  March  2019  Answer  claims  that  he  immediately  worked
out  a  new  budget,  began  making  payments  on  the  arrears,  and  had  made  all  the
required monthly payments to date, his Response shows that he made payments on 21
February, 1 March, 19 March, 29 March, 12 April, and had submitted the payment for 26
April 2019 (Item 4).  Applicant did not submit any court records to show the status of his
child support account.
3The three banking documents appear to be from two different banking institutions, only one of which is clearly
connected to the child support order case number. The submitted records document six-seven payments of
$650.
The   SOR  alleges,  Government  exhibits  (Items  1-4)  substantiate,   and   Applicant
admits  $61,565.06  in  child  support  arrears.  After  he  received  the   SOR,  he  made
$3,900-4,500  in  payments  to  the   creditor.  However,  he  documented  no  financial  or
credit  counseling,  presented  no  budget,  and   he  provided  no  work  or  character
references, or any evidence of community involvement.
