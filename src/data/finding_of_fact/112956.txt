Applicant,  age  42,  has  never  been  married.  She  has  three  adult  children.  She
received her GED in 1999. She took some college courses, without earning a degree,
between  August  2015  and  August  2016.  This  is  her  first  application  for  a  security
clearance.
Applicant  was  employed  in  exclusively  part-time  positions  from  at  least  2006
through  June  2017.  The  record  does  not  specify  whether  she  was  either  unable  or
unwilling to work full time during that period. She had one period of unemployment, after
being  fired,  from  October  2016  through  February  2017.  She  has  been  employed  in  a
janitorial  services  position  by  a  defense  contractor  since  February  2017.  She  began
working for them full time in June 2017.
Applicant  has  28  unresolved  delinquent  debts  totaling  $48,171,  including  three
federal  student  loan  accounts  totaling  $15,140  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b  and  1.e),  and  16
medical accounts  totaling  $13,050  (SOR  ¶¶ 1.f  –  1.o  and  1.t  – 1.y). Without  providing
any corroborating documents, she disputed a $7,347 automobile loan account (SOR  ¶
1.z)  on  the  basis  that  it  was  not  her  account.  That  account  is  listed  as  an  individual
account on her credit report. (Item 5 at 11)
Applicant engaged the services of a credit management company  (Company A)
in approximately October 2017 to assist her in resolving  the debts alleged in the SOR.
Company A advised her not to pay her creditors directly. In addition to debt settlement
assistance,  Company  A  offers  budgeting  information  and  credit  education  services.
However,  the  record  did  not  specify  whether  Applicant  availed  herself  of  those
additional services. As of November 2017, her debt resolution plan also included going
back to school to increase her earning potential and securing additional part-time work.
However,  the  record  did  not  specify  whether  she  followed  through  with  either  option.
(AE A; Item 4 at 5 and 9)
financial
indebtedness
Applicant  attributed  her
to  unemployment  and
underemployment. She incurred some of her medical debt from a surgery she had at a
time when she was uninsured.  As of November 2017, she was willing and able to pay
her debts and had been living within her means. As of February 2019, without providing
any corroborating documentation, Applicant proffered that the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶
1.a  through  1.x,  1.aa,  and  1.bb  were  in  various  stages  of  Company  A’s  settlement
negotiations  process,  and  that  she  had  a  “financial  agreement”  in  place  for  the  debt
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.y. (Item 2 at 5-7)
The  Government  identified  in  the  FORM  the  areas  in  which  Applicant  failed  to
provide documentary evidence to support her mitigation case. She was also advised of
the opportunity to submit that evidence in her FORM response. She did not respond to
the FORM. (FORM at 2-3)
