On  November  24,  2015,  Applicant  submitted  an  Electronic  Questionnaire  for
Investigations  Processing.  (Item  2)  A  subsequent  background  investigation  revealed
Applicant  had  three  delinquent  debts.  The  debts  include  a  past-due  mortgage  in  the
amount of $59,035 (SOR ¶ 1.a: Item 4 at 2; Item 5 at 1; Item 6 at 1); a charged-off credit
card  account  in  the  amount  of  $9,959  (SOR  ¶  1.b:  Item  5  at  2;  Item  6  at  2);  and  a
delinquent  utility  account  in  the  amount  of  $344 that  was  placed for collection  (SOR  ¶
1.c: Item 4 at 4; Item 5 at 2).
Between June 2014 and August 2016, Applicant encountered several periods of
unemployment  or  underemployment.  After  he  separated  from  the  U.S.  Air  Force,  he
was  unemployed  from  June  2014  to  October  2014.  He  found  employment  in  October
2014, but was laid off in October 2015. He was unemployed until March 2016 when he
was  hired  by  his  current  employer,  however,  he  worked  on  a  part-time  status  from
March 2016 to August 2016.  Applicant relied on his savings to supplement his periods
of unemployment or under-employment. He got behind on his mortgage payments and
relied on his credit card to pay expenses during this period. (Item 3)
Applicant applied for and ultimately received a mortgage loan modification, which
was  approved  on  May  31,  2019.  He  successfully  completed  a  Trial  Period  Plan  from
January 2019 to March 2019. He timely paid monthly payments of $1,717.01 during the

month  starting  in  April  2019  to  February  2020  in  order  to  resolve  the  debt  for  $4,108.
Applicant is making payments towards this debt. (Item 1)
The  $344  utility  account  was  for  the  residence  Applicant  lived  in  at  a  previous
duty station. He was not aware of this debt. He indicated that he paid the debt off in his
Answer to the SOR. He provided a confirmation number.  The debt is no longer listed on
his most recent credit report. SOR ¶ 1.c is found for Applicant. (SOR ¶ 1.c: Item 1; Item
