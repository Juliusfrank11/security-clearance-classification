In response to the SOR,  Applicant admitted all allegations with the exception of
SOR  1.i,  stating  that  he  paid  that  account.  He  generally  denied  that  he  is  financially
irresponsible  or  lives  beyond  his  means.    He  is  51  years  old.  While  he  served  in  the
United States Air Force Reserve from 1988 until 2012, he held a security clearance. He
received an honorable discharge. In 1991, he obtained his undergraduate degree and in
2015, he received his master’s degree. He is married and has three children. Two of his
children  are  young  adults  and  the  youngest  lives  with  him.  Applicant  completed  his
latest  security  clearance  application  in  September  2017.  He  obtained  a  public  trust
position in 2016. (GE 1) He has worked for his current employer as a teacher for about
one month earning $48,480. (Tr.16, 27) He is sponsored by his former employer for a
security clearance. (Tr. 16)
Financial
The  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.d  alleged  failure  to  timely  file  Federal  income  tax  returns  for
tax years 2014, 2015, and 2017; delinquent federal tax debt in the amount of $19,776
for  tax  year  2014;  delinquent  federal  tax  debt  in  the  amount  of  $53,379  for  tax  year
2015; and delinquent federal tax debt in the amount of $6,821 for tax year 2017. SOR ¶
1.e alleged an indebtedness for a state tax lien entered in January 2019 in the amount
of  $3,157;  and  the  remaining  allegations  include  five  collection  accounts  for  an
approximate  total  of  $109,000.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.f-1.i)  Applicant  admitted  that  there  are
financial issues of immediate concern and he and his wife  are working diligently to get
things on track. (Answer)
Applicant  explained  that  he  was  unemployed  from  January  2019  until  August
2019.  (Tr.  19)  At  his  last  job,  he  was  earning  $38  an  hour.  (Tr.  19)  He  received
unemployment benefits in the amount of $357 a week. (Tr. 33) He paid some household
bills  with  this  money  and  his  wife  paid  the  core  of  the  bills.  (Tr.  33)  His  wife  earns  an
annual salary of $79,900. (Tr. 34) He was also unemployed in April 2015 to September
2016. (GE 1)
As to SOR ¶ 1.a-1.d, Applicant attributed his failure to file the federal income tax
returns  for  2014,  2015,  and  2017  timely,  in  part  due  to  his  prior  use  of  alcohol  and  a
PTSD problem, which added strain to his marriage. He was candid in that his wife was
reluctant to help him financially. (Tr. 37) He acknowledged that he paid some bills and
let the taxes be paid later. (Tr. 37) He has been dealing with his problem and is acting
responsibly.  He  understands  that  he  has  to  work  through  his  financial  problems.  His
wife  usually  handled  the  money  issues,  as  he  was  never  that  great  with  them.  His
paycheck  is  deposited  to  her  account.  She  gives  him  certain  amounts  of  money.  He
admits  that  he  owes  about  $80,000  to  the  Federal  government  for  delinquent  taxes.
(Answer)
Applicant  explained  that  his  wife  usually  filed  the  income  tax  returns  as  filing
jointly. However, for 2014, the income tax was filed in September 2015, and there was
an  account  balance  of  $19,776  as  of  March  11,  2019.  (GE  4)  His  wife  filed  jointly
without telling Applicant that she claimed three exemptions and he filed jointly as well.
No taxes were paid to the IRS. He established an installment agreement in November
2017  with  the  IRS,  which  ended  March  2018  because  new  tax  debt  arose.  That
agreement  or  plan  stops  and  a  new  one  must  begin  with  the  IRS  according  to  a  tax
consultant. (Tr. 44)
For tax year 2015, the Federal income tax return was not filed until July 2, 2018
and  a  delinquent  tax  balance  of  $53,379  was  owed  as  of  March  11,  2019.  (GE  4)
Applicant thought his wife filed the income tax jointly as she usually does, but she only
filed for herself. (Tr. 48) He did not realize this until he contacted the IRS later in 2017.
His wife reportedly told Applicant that she filed separately for herself so that she could
get a refund. He candidly stated that was an indication of the stress in the marriage –no
communication. (Tr. 49)
For tax year 2017, delinquent taxes are $6,821. However, Applicant submitted a
chart that shows the current amount is $7,482. (AE A) He explained that at the time he
experienced a reduction in force and lost his regular salary, which was about $138,000.
He was given a severance package of about $60,000, which was not taxed. (Tr. 52) He
used  the  money  to  pay  bills,  but  the  money  was  gone  by  February  2016.  (Tr.  52)  He
believed he would find another job soon but that did not occur. (Tr. 53) He filed the tax
return in November 2018. (Tr. 54) Applicant again attributes this vexing situation to the
wife’s  handling  of  the  income  tax  filing  separately  instead  of  jointly,  but  he  does  not
blame his wife for the situation.
Applicant  recently  started  a  second  payment  plan  (in  process)  with  the  IRS  for
the delinquent tax debts for the years in question. He started the process with the IRS in
June 2018, but the payment plan was not approved, as he could not make the minimum
amount.  (GE  5)  He  believes  the  minimum  amount  was  $1,000.  At  this  time,  he
submitted  a  chart  showing  his  payment  history  from  2017  through  2019  for  a  total  of
$1,343 in payments. (AE B) At this time, Applicant has filed all his Federal income tax
returns for the years alleged in the SOR.
SOR 1.e is the amount of a January 2019 state tax lien in the amount of $3,157.
(GE 6) Applicant admits the lien and stated that he has contacted the appropriate state
office to enter a repayment plan. However, he believes that he owes the state $11,000
for the year 2015. (Tr.63)
As  to  SOR  1.f,  Applicant  admits  that  this  is  a  delinquent  debt  to  his
undergraduate  school,  which  he  learned  about  from  a  collection  agency.  He  made  18
monthly payments of $125 on the account, but the payments ceased in October 2018.
The  original  amount  was  $52,070  and  is  now  $48,395  according  to  the  SOR.  He
contacted  the  agency  and  learned  that  there  is  no  record  of  the  debt  or  why  the
automatic payments stopped. (Attachment 1 with answer in file.) However, he filed for a
scholastic  academic  transcript  and  that  showed  an  amount  of  $23,000.  (Tr.  67)  He
could not receive an official transcript due to the amount that showed. (Tr. 68)
SOR  1.g  is  a  collection  account  in  the  amount  of  $10,500.  This  is  related  to  a
credit card debt. He states that he is making monthly payments of $150.00. (Tr. 84, GE
2, GE 4)
SOR  1.h  is  a  student-loan  debt-collection-account  from  the  Department  of
Education in the amount of $42,413. He stated at the hearing that he has not made any
payments to date because he has no proof of this debt and he has been victimized in
the  past.  (GE  2)  In  addition,  the  student  loan  was  being  paid  by  his  employer  at  that
time and the employer initially stated that they would pay the tuition. However, when the
contract  ended  and  Applicant  had  no  work,  the  employer  stopped  paying  the  tuition.
Applicant  stated  that  he  never heard from  anyone  to  collect  any  money.  He  contacted
the  department  in  2016  to  initiate  a  payment  arrangement  but  he  never  heard  from
them. (GE 3)
SOR 1.i is a collection account in the amount of $4,521. Applicant stated that this
debt was paid in full in 2016, in a sworn affidavit. (GE 2, 3)
SOR  1.j  is  a  debt  in  collection  for  the  amount  of  $3,314.  Applicant  has  made
monthly  payments  of  $106.36.  Applicant  presented  documentation  that  the  current
balance is now $711.56. (AE D)
Applicant had a 2018 budget in the file when he was gainfully employed. He has
two  car  notes  and  a  mortgage  loan  for  $1,265.  He  listed  his  payments  to  creditors
including  one  on  the  SOR  allegation.  (GE  5)  At  this  time,  he  and  his  wife  share  the
household expenses. (Tr.87)
Applicant  explained  in  his  investigative  interview  in  2018  that  he  is  seeking
assistance  from  a  credit  counselor.  (Tr.  83)  His  wife  prepared  the  income  taxes  each
year and did not want to employ a professional tax preparer. (Tr. 65)
Applicant acknowledged that he has not been consistent with his financial affairs
in  the  past.  He  did  not  file  the  taxes  because  he  assumed  his  wife  did  but  he  did  not
check.  He  also  thought  that  he  would  owe  money  and  with  the  periods  of
unemployment, he did not have any money. He explained that if there was a tax liability,
his wife would not pay it.
