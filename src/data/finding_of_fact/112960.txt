In  her  SOR  response,  Applicant  admitted  17  or  the  19  SOR  allegations.  I  have
incorporated  her  admissions  in  my  findings  of  fact.  Applicant’s  personal  information  is
extracted  from  her  SCA,  FORM  Item  2,  unless  otherwise  indicated  by  a  parenthetical
citation to the record.
Applicant, 30, was born in Sudan and immigrated to the United States in 1999 with
her family. She was ten years old at the time. She was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in
2005. Applicant was educated in the United States, receiving a high school diploma in
2007 and a bachelor’s degree in May 2013.
Applicant struggled to find appropriate employment after her college graduation,
but in July 2014 she was hired by a company in Doha, Qatar, which provides staffing to
U.S.  companies  contracting  with  the  U.S.  Government.  In  March  2017,  she  began  in-
processing with a new employer in the Middle East, which sponsored her to apply for a
security clearance. She submitted her SCA in April 2017.
During her unemployment and underemployment for over a year in 2013 and 2014,
she defaulted on a number of student loans and other debts. The SOR lists ten student
loans that have been placed for collection. The total amount of those loans is alleged and
admitted by Applicant to be about $33,000. In addition, the SOR lists nine consumer debts
with a total amount of about $11,000. The record evidence supports the conclusion that
six  of  these  consumer  debts  became  delinquent  in  2013  or  early  2014  following
Applicant’s graduation. One of the other debts arose when Applicant’s car was totaled in
2016. Two other minor debts for mobile phone service are also more recent. (FORM Item
3 at 4.)
The details and current status of the 19 debts alleged in the SOR is as follows:
Ten Student Loans in Collection in the Total Amount of about $33,000 (SOR
¶  1.a  -1.g,  1.i,  1.k,  and  1.m.)  The  U.S.  Department  of  Education  (DOE)  guaranteed
Applicant’s ten defaulted loans and following Applicant’s default, the DOE transferred the
loans to a collection agency (Agency). In August 2018, she entered into a rehabilitation
program with the Agency under which she  made six monthly payments of $119 on 17
federally guaranteed student loans. She provided with her SOR response records from
the Agency evidencing her monthly payments from August 2018 through January 2019.
The amount of the payments was determined by her income. A separate letter from the
Agency states that these payments are part of a loan rehabilitation program and that the
next step will be the formal consolidation of the loans with Applicant’s student loan service
provider. The Agency official concludes her letter with the statement that Applicant “has
taken the proper steps to move forward” and complete the consolidation process. (SOR
response.)
Auto  Loan  Charged  Off  in  the  Amount  of  $2,942  (SOR  ¶  1.h.)  In  December
2015, Applicant bought a 2013 Toyota Corolla. She paid for the car, in part, with a car
loan. At that time, Applicant was living in the Middle East. She signed a power of attorney
granting  her  sister  the  right  to  use  the  vehicle.  In  June  2016,  a  driver  hit  the  Toyota
resulting in a total loss of the car. The driver’s insurance company paid part of the loss to
the creditor, but not all, leaving a balance of $2,942. In January 2019, Applicant’s sister
brought a small claims court lawsuit against the driver. The court entered a judgment in
March  2019  in favor of  the  defendant for unexplained  reasons.  Government  Exhibit  6,
which  is  a  February  2019  credit  report,  reflects  that  Applicant  remains  liable  for  the
balance of the car loan in the amount alleged in the SOR, i.e., $2,942. Applicant’s FORM
response  includes a  June  2019  letter from  the  collection  agency  handling  the  account
evidencing that she has agreed to make two payments of $1,177.50 by July 24, 2019, to
settle this debt. (SOR response; FORM response; GE 6 at 6)
Delinquent Loan Owed to a Bank Charged Off in the Amount of $2,463 (SOR
¶ 1.j) In November 2012, Applicant borrowed funds from a bank to help with her college
expenses. She defaulted on the loan in September 2013. Due to the age of the debt, it is
no longer enforceable under the applicable state law. The debt remains on her February
2019 credit report. (GE 6 at 7.)
Other Non-Enforceable Charged-Off Debts (SOR ¶¶ 1. o, 1.p, 1.r.) These three
debts alleged in the SOR are owed to a department store ($698), a second department
store ($398), and a bank and its collection agency ($979). In her SOR response, Applicant
wrote that she opened these accounts in 2013, but was unable to pay them due to her
employment  difficulties.  In  her SCA,  Applicant  listed  the  bank  debt  and  wrote  that  this
debt became delinquent in May 2015 when she was experiencing financial hardship. She
believes that these debts are no longer enforceable due to the passage of time. The two
department  store debts  remain  on  her February  2019  credit  report.  Applicant  provided
with  her  FORM  response  a  March  2019  letter  from  one  of  the  department  stores
confirming that the store is “no longer attempting to collect the remaining balance on this
account.” (FORM response; SOR response; GE 6 at 6, 7.)
Bank Credit-Card Account in Collection in the Amount of $1,538 (SOR ¶ 1.l.)
Applicant opened this account in January 2011. Her last payment was made in December
2013,  during  her  period  of  post-graduation  unemployment  and  underemployment.  In
January 2019, she negotiated a settlement payment of $615.59 to be paid on the same
date.  She  documented  the  settlement  proposal,  however,  she  did  not  document  her
payment. (FORM response; GE 4 at 14.)
Bank Credit-Card Account in Collection in the Amount of $1,025 (SOR ¶ 1.n.)
Applicant opened this account in February 2008. Her last payment was made in January
2014. With her FORM Response, she provided a letter from the bank, dated February 5,
2019, informing her that her account was closed with a zero balance. (GE 4 at 3; FORM
response.)
Mobile  Telephone  Provider  Account  in  Collection  in  the  Amount  of  $435
(SOR ¶ 1.q.) This account was referred to a collection account in April 2016. With her
SOR  response,  Applicant  provided  an  October  2018  letter  from  the  collection  agency
offering to settle this debt for $225. The February 2019 credit report in the record reflects
a zero balance for this account. (SOR response; GE 6 at 1.)
Mobile  Telephone  Provider  Account  in  Collection  in  the  Amount  of  $623
(SOR  ¶  1.s.)  This  account  was  referred  to  a  collection  agency  in  April  2017. With  her
FORM response, she provided a May 2019 letter from the collection agency reflecting its
receipt of payments in January 2019 or earlier in the total amount of $230.66 in settlement
of this debt. (FORM response; GE 4 at 5.)
