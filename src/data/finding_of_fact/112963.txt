Applicant is a 47-year-old systems administrator currently employed by a defense
contractor since April 2017. He received his bachelor’s degree in 1997. He and his wife
married in 1994 and have four children. This is Applicant’s first application for a security
clearance. (GX 1.)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in
2015; failed to file his 2013 through 2017 federal tax returns; is indebted to the federal
government for $7,832 for tax year 2011; and owes $34,910 for a federal tax lien entered
against  him  in  2013.  Applicant  admits  the  bankruptcy,  failing  to  file  his  taxes,  and  the
delinquent  taxes  owed  for  2011.  He  denies  the  federal  tax  lien.  His  admissions  are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Before  2013,  Applicant  and  his  wife  were  financially  stable  and  able  to  support
their family of six. In June 2013, Applicant’s wife became the legal guardian of her then-
10-year-old  cousin  after  his  stepmother  died  from  an  illness  and  his  father  entered
inpatient treatment for drug abuse. Adding another person to the household, bringing the
total to seven, caused increased financial strains on Applicant. Additionally, Applicant had
one  daughter  in  college  and  Applicant’s  wife  went  back  to  school  full  time.  Applicant
became  the  sole  financial  provider  for  the  household.  Throughout  their  marriage,
Applicant’s wife was responsible for handling the family finances. During this period of
greater financial obligations, she overspent and “let our finances get ahead of us.” (Tr.
72.) Upon learning of their overextended financial situation, Applicant met with an attorney
who advised him to file bankruptcy, which he did. He and his wife participated in financial
counseling  and marriage  counseling,  in  part,  to  prevent future financial  crises.  (Tr.  22-
23.)
Between about 2009 and 2011, Applicant was working in another state. In about
2015, Applicant was contacted by the IRS and informed that he had not been properly
taxed by his employer while working in another state and that he owed taxes for 2011.
Initially,  the  IRS  informed  Applicant  that  the  delinquent  tax  amount  was  $34,910,  as
alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.d.  Applicant’s  attorney  listed  this  amount  in  Applicant’s  Chapter  7
bankruptcy  petition.  However,  Applicant  subsequently  disputed  the  amount  claimed  by
the IRS and the IRS recalculated the amount to $7,832 (SOR ¶ 1.c). (GX 2.) Applicant
entered a repayment agreement with the IRS in  January 2014, wherein $125 a month
was automatically debited from Applicant’s bank account. As of July 1, 2019, the balance
was $4,519. However, the IRS applied a portion of Applicant’s refund from tax year 2017
to this debt and it is now satisfied. (Tr. 35-36; GX 2; AX N; AX I; Tr. 28-30; Tr. 62-63.)
Applicant and his wife did not timely file their income tax returns for 2013 through
2017.  The  reason  for  this  failure  to  timely  file  is  twofold.  First,  Applicant’s  wife  was
operating under the erroneous idea that she had three years to file her tax returns if she
was owed a refund. Second, in attempting to use tax-preparation software, she entered
her  cousin’s  social  security  number  to  claim  him  as  a  dependent  and  the  entry  was
rejected. Applicant’s wife later discovered that her uncle had been claiming her cousin as
a dependent, despite the fact that Applicant’s wife had legal custody of the child. (Tr. 35.)
Resolving  this  issue  required  that  Applicant’s  wife  manually  complete  the  tax  returns.
Because this process was time-consuming and difficult, and because she misunderstood
the filing requirements, Applicant’s wife put off filing the returns. (Tr. 35-36; Tr. 85.) She
has since filed all of the returns. (AX A through AX H.) Applicant timely filed his 2018 tax
return. (AX H.) Applicant does not owe any outstanding taxes.
Applicant  and  his  wife  now  share  the  responsibility  of  managing  the  household
finances. Applicant’s wife’s cousin no longer resides with them, and only their youngest
child remains in the household. (Tr. 64; Tr. 18.) Applicant does not have any current or
recent  delinquent  accounts  and  lives  within  his  means.  He  is a  committed  and  valued
employee who has received outstanding performance evaluations and multiple awards
and recognitions. (AX K; AX L.) His coworkers highly recommend Applicant for a security
clearance and characterize him as trustworthy, honest, and reliable. (AX M.) Applicant
was candid, sincere, and credible while testifying.
