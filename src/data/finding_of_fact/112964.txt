Iraq
Iraq  is  a  constitutional  parliamentary  republic.  The  outcome  of  the  2014
parliamentary  elections  generally  met  international  standards  of  free  and  fair  elections
and led to the peaceful transition of power from former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. (HE I)
The U.S. Department of State warns that travel within Iraq remains very dangerous
and  the  ability  of  the  U.S.  Embassy  to  assist  U.S.  citizens  is  extremely  limited.  U.S.
citizens in Iraq are at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence. Numerous terrorist
and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such groups regularly attack Iraqi
security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten U.S. citizens
and western companies throughout Iraq. (HE I)
Severe  human  rights  problems  are  widespread  in  Iraq.  Sectarian  hostility,
widespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society
weakened the government’s authority and worsened effective human rights protections.
Problems include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities;
arbitrary arrests and lengthy pretrial detention; limits on freedom of expression to include
press,  social,  religious  and  political  restrictions  in  academic  and  cultural  matters;
discrimination  against  and  societal  abuse  of  women  and  ethnic,  religious,  and  racial
minorities; seizure of property without due process and limitations of worker rights. (HE I)
