I have incorporated Applicant’s admissions in his SOR response in the findings of
fact.  Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  GE  1,  his  security  clearance
application  (SCA),  dated  April  20,  2017,  unless  otherwise  indicated  by  a  parenthetical
citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the record
evidence, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant, 49, has worked for a U.S. Government contractor as an engineer since
2013. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1992 to 2000 and deployed on two occasions,
once to the United Kingdom and once to Saudi Arabia. He held a top secret clearance
throughout  his  military  service  and  was  granted  eligibility  for  access  to  sensitive
compartmented information (SCI) in 1999 as part of his duties during Operation Desert
Shield. (GE 5 at 2.)
Applicant has been married since 1993. He and his wife have three children, ages
22 to 24. In 1992, he earned a high school diploma. He reports no unemployment during
the last 15 years.
In 2004, Applicant and his family moved to State 1 where they presently reside. In
November 2005, he and his wife purchased House 1 for $360,000 with a $100,000 cash
down payment and the balanced financed with a first mortgage. In 2007, they purchased
House 2 for $620,000, all of which was financed with a first mortgage,  and moved into
that house while renting House 1. Shortly thereafter, their oldest child became seriously
ill. She was treated in their local city for about 18 months at which time she became even
sicker. After much research, Applicant and his wife determined that their daughter’s best
chances for survival was to be treated at a hospital in State 2. Applicant relocated his
family to State 2 so that his child could be treated there.  They put both houses on the
market to sell, but the housing market crash made that difficult. In 2008, they successfully
sold House 2 in a short sale for $425,000. They rented House 1 for a period. (Tr. 17-22,
27.)
In about November 2009, the treatment of Applicant’s daughter was completed,
and he moved his family back to State 1. They lived in House 1 until November 2010. At
that time, he and his wife bought House 3, paying $245,000. They rented House 1 again,
but the tenants vacated sometime thereafter. (Tr. 23-35.)
In  October 2006,  Applicant  had  also  taken  out  a  Home  Equity  Line  of  Credit  or
HELOC  secured  by  House  1  with  a  debt  of  about  $145,000.  He  primarily  used  the
proceeds of that loan to make improvements to House 1. In 2011, the mortgage on the
house  1  was  about  $218,000  and  it  was  worth  about  $200,000.  He  had  a  significant
negative equity in the property. He was advised by a friend who was a realtor to let the
house  go  to  foreclosure.  Applicant  agreed  and  stopped  paying  his  mortgage  and  the
HELOC. In 2012, the mortgage holder foreclosed due to the defaulted loan. Following the
foreclosure, the first mortgage bank accepted the proceeds of the sale, and the HELOC
lender received nothing. Under the terms of the HELOC, the lender converted the HELOC
into a personal loan on which Applicant remained liable in the full amount of the debt. This
debt is the subject of SOR ¶ 1.a. (Tr. 23-35.)
After the foreclosure, Applicant began to again pay the former HELOC debt until
2015. His realtor friend advised him that the lender would not negotiate a settlement with
him as long as he continued to pay the loan every month, so Applicant stopped paying
the monthly charge of $288. He choose to do this even though he had the financial ability
to continue to pay the loan. He made attempts to negotiate a settlement with the lender
with discussions over the phone for another two years.  At one point, he offered to pay
$24,000. He also testified that he offered to pay $60,000 in 2017, but the lender never
responded. Instead, the lender issued a FORM 1099-C at the end of the year cancelling
the entire debt in the amount of 147,982, which included $2,200 of unpaid interest. Due
to a tax exclusion, he was not obligated to pay taxes on the cancelled debt. Applicant has
no  plans  to take any further steps  to pay  this  debt,  notwithstanding  his current  annual
income of $150,000 to $170,000. (Tr. 36-40, 45-46, 51.)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a charged-off account held by a retail-store, credit-card bank in
the amount of $3,237. In his SOR response, Applicant admitted this debt. This debt arose
out of Applicant’s purchase of a TV for $1,800 in 2009. The purchase was made on credit.
Both of the Government’s credit reports for Applicant in the record reflect that the debt is
in  collection.  Applicant  claims  that  he  set  up  online  an  automatic  payment  of  $75  per
month  to  be  paid  out  of  his  debit  card.  His  payments  stopped  at  some  point,  which
Applicant blamed on his debit card expiring in about 2011. The debt was turned over to a
collection agency, and it demanded payment in the amount of $2,800. Applicant believed
he had paid the debt down to about $600. He disputed the debt with the collection agency
and demanded documentation from the collection agency to establish the amount of the
debt, which he testified was never provided. He has had no further contact with anyone
about the debt, and it remains unpaid. (Tr. 46-48, 55-56; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 1.)
SOR 1.c alleges an account owed to a collection agency in the amount of $108.
Applicant denied this debt in his SOR response. The debt arose after Applicant cancelled
his  Internet  service  in  December  2014  and  did  not  return  the  modem  to  the  service
provider. In his background interview, he told the investigator that the collection agency
offered to call the service provider to ask if it would accept the return of the modem in lieu
of a payment. He said that he never heard further about the matter and plans to do nothing
but wait until the collection agency calls or writes him. At the hearing, he testified simply
that  the  matter  was  resolved,  though  he  said  he  had  no  proof  of  the  resolution.  He
believes the matter is resolved because the debt does not appear on his credit report. He
did not offer the credit report into evidence. The debt does not appear in either of the two
more recent credit reports introduced by the Government. It is the subject of a discussion
in Applicant’s background interview, which indicates that the debt appeared in the credit
report  in  the  possession  of  the  government  interviewer  at  the  time.  In  an  email  dated
October 4, 2019, Applicant advised that he just paid the Internet service provider $111 to
resolve this debt. (Tr. 48-49; GE 2 at 4-5; Hearing Ex 2 at 1-2.)
