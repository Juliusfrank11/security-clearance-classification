Financial Considerations
Applicant’s  SOR  in  ¶¶  1.d,  1.c,  1.b,  and  1.a  alleges he filed  bankruptcy  in 2001,
2010,  2017,  and  2018.  Applicant’s  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  personal
subject interview (PSI) took place on January 23, 2018. (GE 3) The bankruptcies will be
discussed in chronological order.
SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  Applicant  filed  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  August  2001.  His
nonpriority unsecured debts were discharged in November 2001. Applicant said his first
spouse was committing adultery, spending excessively, and gambling. (Tr. 20-21, 35) He
blamed his first spouse for mishandling the family finances while he was away from home
for training. (Tr. 76-77) His debts totaled $23,600. (GE4 at 8 of 8) Applicant agreed to take
responsibility for the family debts in the divorce; Applicant obtained custody of his son; and
his spouse agreed to pay $150 monthly in child support. (Tr. 20, 35, 83) He believed after
the divorce and his bankruptcy the creditors did not seek payment from his former spouse
of their debts. (Tr. 85) Child care was expensive. (Tr. 34)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2010, and he
claimed $56,368 in nonpriority unsecured claims. His nonpriority unsecured debts were
discharged in October 2010. After Applicant retired from the Air Force in 2007, his income
was reduced because he was underemployed. (Tr. 35-38) His Air Force monthly base pay
was $4,142 (E-7 over 22 years). (2009 Military Pay Scale United States Military Service
Pay  Information  website,  https://www.militaryfactory.com/pay-scales/2009-military-pay-
scale.asp)  He also received $1,300 in housing allowance and $637 for rations and special
pay. (Tr. 69-71) His gross pay on active duty was about $73,000. He said he also had a
period of unemployment. (Tr. 37) In 2007 and 2008, he earned about $52,000 to $54,000
annually. (Tr. 68) In 2009, his gross income was about $58,000 (about $38,000 from his
post-retirement employment and about $20,000 in Air Force retirement pay). (Tr. 67; AE
B)  Before  filing  for  bankruptcy,  he  said  he  attempted  to  use  a  debt  consolidation  and
payment plan (DCPP) to resolve his debts. (Tr. 36) He terminated his participation in the
DCPP because the DCPP used most of his payments for service charges, and Applicant
decided DCPP was not making sufficient progress resolving his debts. (Tr. 36)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in May 2017. In June
2018,  this  bankruptcy  was  dismissed  for  failure  to  make  plan  payments.  In  2015,  his
annual income was about $74,000 ($54,000 from employment and $20,000 from his Air
Force retirement). (GE 6 at 43 of 50) In 2016, Applicant’s gross income was about $10,000
less  and  totaled  $64,000  ($44,000  from  employment  and  $20,000  from  his  Air  Force
retirement).  (AE  B;  GE  6  at  43  of  50)  Applicant  changed  employment,  and  he  said  his
income was reduced. (Tr. 39-40) His Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing indicates his monthly
gross  pay  for  the  previous  10  months  was  $3,200  monthly;  his  retired  pay  was  $1,600
monthly; and his income from part-time employment was $390 monthly. (GE 6 at 37 of 50,
38) His total gross income at the time he filed his Chapter 13 was $65,000. (GE 6 at 45 of
50) He said he filed for Chapter 13 because he wanted to pay his debts. (Tr. 40) In April
2017,  he  accepted  employment  with  an  annual  pay  of  $53,000,  an  increase  of  about
$10,000 in his gross pay from wages. (AE B; GE 6 at 43 of 50) It is unclear whether he
disclosed the $10,000 in increased income to the bankruptcy court.
Applicant’s Chapter 13 filing indicates 20 claims totaling about $256,000 as follows:
vehicle loan ($9,100); Internal Revenue Service (IRS) debt ($5,900); first mortgage debt
($153,000); vehicle loan ($31,600); four credit union debts ($1,100; $2,500; $1,100; and
$2,400); eight loans ($12,700; $6,100; $2,200; $6,600; $600; $1,300; $4,400; and $1,800);
two telecommunications debts ($300 and $600); unspecified debt ($200); and credit card
debt  ($2,500).  (GE  6  at  11-18,  26  of  50)  His  monthly  income  was  $5,457;  his  monthly
expenses were $2,058; and his debt owed to the government was $3,087. (GE 6 at 26
and  27  of  50)  His  first  mortgage  arrearage  was  $17,000,  and  his  second  mortgage
arrearage was $3,000. (GE 6 at 28 and 29 of 50) Prior to filing for bankruptcy in 2017, he
borrowed five personal loans ranging from $14,600 to $2,400, and he said he thought he
could pay them back if he was able to secure better paying employment. (Tr. 83; GE 6 at
to 32 and 35 of 50) He borrowed funds to help him make payments on other debts. (Tr.
83) He conceded that his borrowing pattern showed “bad decisions.” (HE 3)
Claim 2 on Applicant’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy is an IRS claim for $5,900. (GE 6 at
11 of 50) Elsewhere his bankruptcy filing indicates a federal tax debt of $3,100 which was
incurred in 2015. (GE 6 at 26, 27, 30, and 36 of 50)
Applicant’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing shows he had $2,300 monthly available to
address his delinquent debts. (GE 6 at 48 of 50) His monthly Chapter 13 payment was
$3,147. (GE 3 at 4) Applicant was in the Chapter 13 for 10 months, and he paid $22,097.
(GE 6 at 48-50 of 50) His plan required him to make monthly payments for five years. (Tr.
41) All of the payments were distributed to secured creditors. (GE 6 at 48-50 of 50) The
IRS debt for $5,900 was unsecured and no payments to the IRS were made through his
Chapter 13 bankruptcy. (GE 6 at 48-50 of 50)
Applicant  said  he  was  unable  to  make  the  Chapter  13  monthly  payments  to  the
trustee because he needed to pay $1,300 to fix his home air conditioner. (Tr. 41) He only
had $1,000 monthly remaining after making the bankruptcy payment to support himself
and two daughters. (Tr. 41) His attorney suggested he “flip” the Chapter 13 and file for a
Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (Tr. 41-42) Under the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer
Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), Applicant had to wait eight years from the original date
of filing before he could file another Chapter 7. In this instance, he waited eight years and
one month to file after his 2010 Chapter 7 bankruptcy to file his 2018 Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  filed  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  June  2018  and
claimed $64,102 in nonpriority unsecured claims. His nonpriority unsecured debts were
discharged in October 2018. He did not have any unemployment in 2018. (Tr. 78) His pay
throughout 2018 was consistent. (Tr. 79) His gross pay was $80,000. (GE 7 at 53 of 58)
At  the  time  he  filed  for  bankruptcy,  he  had  a  first  mortgage  of  $155,000  and  a  second
mortgage of $20,000. (Tr. 81) His mortgages were current evidently due to the payments
of the Chapter 13 trustee. (Tr. 81) He owned two vehicles, and he surrendered both of
them. (Tr. 82) He did not list any priority unsecured debts on his Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
(GE  7  at  30 of  58)  He  indicated  he anticipated a federal income tax  refund for 2018 of
$2,100. (GE 7 at 26 of 58)
Around  February  2016,  Applicant  purchased  a  new  Toyota  Camry,  and  he
borrowed  about  $34,000.  (Tr.  61;  GE  6  at  29  of  50)  When  he  filed  for  Chapter  13
bankruptcy, he owed $32,200 on his loan, and he assessed the value of the vehicle at
$22,000.  (GE 6 at  29 of 50)  His  monthly  vehicle  payment  was  about  $600.  (Tr. 55) He
decided to surrender the Camry, and he used the bankruptcy process to avoid paying the
balance owed to the creditor. (Tr. 55) About 10 days after his debts were discharged in his
2018 bankruptcy, he bought a new Chevy Malibu. (Tr. 60) His monthly payment on the
Chevy  Malibu  loan  is  $520.  (Tr.  54)  He  purchased  the  vehicle  because  he  has  a  long
commute to work, and he needed a reliable vehicle. (Tr. 54-56)
Applicant  received  financial  counseling  as  part  of  his bankruptcies,  and  after his
2018  bankruptcy,  he  completed  several  financial  courses.  (Tr.  43-45,  73-74;  AE  O)  He
utilizes a budget to control his expenses. (Tr. 46) When he uses a credit card, he pays the
balance at the end of the month. (Tr. 53) He pays more than the monthly payment on his
two vehicles. (Tr. 54) His annual gross income is $90,000, and he invests six percent of
his income in his 401(k) account (balance about $1,000). (Tr. 46, 52, 65; AE H; AE I) He
also invests in a Roth IRA account (balance about $3,500 increased by $1,200 from 12
months ago), and he pays his daughter’s college tuition. (Tr. 46; AE H) He maintains a
savings account for emergencies. (Tr. 47) He has $2,777 available on a monthly basis for
investments,  emergencies,  and  savings.  (Tr.  48-49;  AE  C)  He  has  about  $4,500  in  his
checking account, and about $1,100 in his savings accounts. (Tr. 49-50; AE E; AE F)
Applicant promised to maintain his financial responsibility in the future. (Tr. 59) He
expected his income to increase in the future, and he pledged that he would continue to
ensure his expenses were kept to a minimum. (Tr. 59-60)
