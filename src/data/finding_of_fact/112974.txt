Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations,  with  explanations,  and  his  admissions
are  incorporated  into  these  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He began working
at his present job in 2017. He is a high school graduate, has attended firefighter I and II
courses,  and  is  certified  as  an  emergency  medical  technician  (EMT).  He  currently
performs  duties  as  an  emergency  responder  to  workmen  who  deal  with  hazardous
material  at  their  work  site.  He  married  in  2001  and  divorced  in  2015.  He  has  three
children,  ages  18,  11,  and  9.  The  oldest  has  special  needs.  Applicant  and  his  ex-wife
worked out an informal child-support arrangement. (Tr. 8, 24-25, 28-29; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  filed  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  petition  in
November  2018,  which  listed  his  total  liabilities  at  approximately  $66,000.  The  SOR
went on to allege seven charged-off or collection accounts listed in the bankruptcy. The
SOR  also  alleged  that  Applicant’s  bankruptcy  petition  disclosed  that  he  owed  federal
taxes in an unknown amount to the IRS.
Applicant  credibly  testified  that  he  married  young  and  started  a  family.  He  put
himself  through  firefighters’  and  EMT  school  at  a  total  cost  of  approximately  $7,000
without  incurring  any  loan  debt.  His  financial  troubles  began  in  approximately  2015
when he was laid off from a well-paying firefighter job with a railroad company. He filed
to receive unemployment benefits, but his appeal was denied. He also went through his
divorce  in  2015.  This  required  him  to  start  a  second  household  for  himself  thereby
incurring  new  expenses.  He  also  incurred  half  of  the  marital  debt  from  the  divorce
settlement.  He  gained  employment  in  the  private  sector,  but  was  unable  to  pay  his
obligations. (Tr. 20, 25-27, 31; AE A)
After  struggling  to  pay  his  debts,  Applicant  filed  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy
protection  in  November  2018.  All  the  debts  listed  in  the  SOR  were  included  in  the
petition.  Applicant’s  2018  federal  tax  return  refund  was  intercepted  and  applied  to  the
bankruptcy costs and debts. Applicant is current on all his federal income tax filings and
payments.  His  debts  were  discharged  by  the  bankruptcy  court  in  September  2019.
Applicant’s  September  2019  credit  report  shows  that  he  is  current  on  all  his  debts.
Applicant’s  financial statement from  November 2018  shows  that  he  has  approximately
$1,400  left  over  monthly  after  paying  his  expenses  and  other  obligations.  He  has  a
savings  account  with  approximately  $3,000.  He  has  no  credit  cards.  He  received
financial counseling through his bankruptcy case and used that knowledge to develop a
monthly budget. (Tr. 23, 32-37; GE 2; AE B-C)
