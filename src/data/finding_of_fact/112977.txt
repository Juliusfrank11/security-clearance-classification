Applicant admitted both SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 45 years old. She is a high school graduate and earned some college
credits, but not a degree. She married in 1994 and divorced in 2002. She has two children
from the marriage, ages 24, and 17 years old. She remarried in 2003, divorced in 2008,
and remarried her third husband in 2010. She has been employed by federal contractors
since 2014 and the same contractor since July 2016. (Item 3)
Applicant  disclosed  on  her  April  2017  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  that
she  failed  to  file  and  pay  her  2006,  2007,  and  2008  federal  income  tax  returns.  She
admitted that there are two federal tax liens filed against her for 2012 ($11,798) and 2011
($49,515).  (Any  derogatory  information  that  was  not  alleged  will  not  be  considered  for
disqualifying purposes, but may be considered when analyzing Applicant’s credibility, in
the application of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis.) (Item 3)
Applicant indicated in the SCA that her second husband was an abusive man, who
refused to allow her to file their taxes or have control over her finances. She said she had
filed several Offers in Compromise with the IRS, but did not know what she was doing.
Documents in the record reflect some documents were filed with the IRS in approximately
2010, 2014, and 2015, but some were incomplete and required more information. Another
document from the IRS indicated it closed its file because there were other investigations
pending that could impact her liability. Applicant stated that she had previously hired a
tax company to help her settle the tax debts, but it took her money and did not assist her.
She said that she has hired a new company to resolve the matter. She said she has been
trying for years to resolve the tax debts and the new company was going to do that. (Item
3)
During  Applicant’s  April  2018  background  investigation,  she  acknowledged  she
owed approximately $70,000 in taxes and was working with a tax company to arrange a
payment plan. She said her ex-husband did not file their tax returns. She was gathering
the paperwork to file another Offer in Compromise with the IRS. (Item 7)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she stated she has been trying since 2009 to
obtain an Offer in Compromise with the IRS. She said a new offer was completed and
being  filed.  She  said  at  the  time  her  tax  returns  were  due,  she  was  unaware  her  ex-
husband had not timely filed them. Applicant did not provide documentary evidence of
any current attempt to resolve her tax liens. (Item 2)
