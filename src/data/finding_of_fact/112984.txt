The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of February 11, 2019, Applicant owed
$47,741 in Federal student loans in collection (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.i); that he was $1,429  past
due on a student loan with a $14,562 balance (SOR ¶ 1.k); and that he owed a collection
balance of $222 to a state (SOR ¶ 1.j). Additionally, he is alleged to owe a $257 collection
debt for cable services (SOR ¶ 1.a); a $120 charged-off credit-card debt (SOR ¶ 1.b); a
$296 collection debt for storage services (SOR ¶ 1.l); and a $5,635 judgment debt to a
former  landlord  (SOR  ¶  1.m).  When  he  responded  to  the  SOR  allegations,  Applicant
admitted the debts without explanation.
After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 43-year-old computer-aided design (CAD) designer with some college
credits but no degree. He has never married and has no children. (GE 1.) In November
2017, he was offered a full-time position with a defense contractor (company X) contingent
on  him  obtaining  a  DOD  secret  clearance.  As  an  onsite  drafter,  he  would  access
unclassified drawings and computer systems on a military base, but access to classified
spaces on the base may be required to perform his duties. Company X has been holding
the billet open for Applicant pending the adjudication of his security clearance eligibility.
(AE H; Tr. 22-24.)
Applicant  attended  a  community  college  from  February  2003  to  June  2006  to
become  a  CAD designer while  working  full  time  for a builder.  (Tr. 47.)  He obtained a
Federal student loan for $10,846 (SOR ¶ 1.c, duplicated in SOR ¶ 1.k) in February 2003.1
He worked for an engineering company as a drafter from April 2006 until August 2008.
From August 2008 to July 2009, he held full-time employment in a CAD position with an
architect. He was laid off in July 2009, but then obtained a contract position with another
employer that ended in December 2009. (GE 1.)
Between  March  2008  and  August  2010,  Applicant  took  basic computer science
classes offered online by a state university. (GE 1; Tr. 47.) He obtained Federal student
loans for $2,000 (SOR ¶ 1.h) and $1,750 (SOR ¶ 1.i) in March 2008; $6,000 (SOR ¶ 1.d)
and $3,500 (SOR ¶1.e) in January 2009; and $6,000 (SOR ¶ 1.f) and $3,500 (SOR ¶ 1.g)
in May 2010. (GEs 1, 3.) He withdrew from college because he did not want to acquire
more student debt to continue in a program in which he was not fully invested. (Tr. 48.)
Applicant defaulted on his student loans when he had to begin repaying them in the spring
of 2011. (GE 3.)
Applicant  was  unemployed  for  almost  the  entire  year  in  2010.  He  then  held  a
temporary position with a staffing agency from December 2010 to December 2011. From
January  2012  until  August  2012,  he  worked  in  electronic  commerce  for  a  publishing
company.  Applicant  resigned  from  that  job  following  a  notice  of  unsatisfactory
performance. He could not keep up with the workload expected of him. (GE 1.)
Applicant collected unemployment benefits while out of work from August 2012 to
October 2013. (Tr. 49.) In October 2013, he returned to work for the staffing agency until
May 2014. (GE 1.) Applicant testified that he made a couple of $100 payments toward his
Federal student loans at that time, but he could not maintain the payments. (Tr. 42.) He
had seasonal employment over the summer of 2014. From September 2014 to November
2014, Applicant worked on and off as a contractor for a CAD business. He had full-time
contract  work  as  a  CAD  technician  from  November  2014  until  March  2015,  when  his
contract was not renewed for reasons related to his performance. (GE 1.)
Applicant was unemployed from March 2015 to August 2015. He fell behind on his
rent, and his then landlord filed for a judgment in May 2015. A judgment on affidavit was
entered against Applicant for $5,635 (SOR ¶ 1.m) in August 2015. Notice of the judgment
was mailed to Applicant, although there is no evidence that he received it. (GE 5.)
Applicant regained full-time employment as a CAD designer in August 2015. He left
that job in May 2016 for a temporary position at higher pay with another employer. His then
cohabitant girlfriend wanted to relocate to be near her family. (Tr. 50-51.) In November
2017, Applicant was offered a full-time position with a defense contractor not far from his
girlfriend’s family. The position in CAD, which pays an annual base salary of $42,203, was
contingent on him obtaining a security clearance. (AE H.)
1 Based on the available credit information and the total principal balance ($34,959) of Applicant’s Federal
student loans, SOR ¶ 1.k alleges the balance of Applicant’s student loan in SOR ¶ 1.c as of May 2012. (GE 3;
AE A.)
On  November 27,  2017,  Applicant  completed  and certified to the accuracy of a
Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86).  In  response  to  financial  record
inquiries, Applicant listed no delinquencies involving enforcement. He responded negatively
to a question concerning whether he had any judgments entered against him in the last
seven years. He admitted that he had some delinquency involving routine accounts. He
indicated that he was in default of approximately $47,791 in Federal student loans, and
explained that he was working to lift the default status of his student loans with a collection
agency. He also disclosed a $222 collection debt with the state (SOR ¶ 1.j) that he claimed
was paid in November 2017. (GE 1.)
A check of Applicant’s credit on December 16, 2017, corroborated that he owed
$47,791  in  Federal  student  loans  in  collection  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c-1.i).2  The  $222  previously
disclosed state debt, apparently for an unpaid parking ticket (Tr. 43), was reportedly in
collection as of September 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.j). A $296 debt owed to a storage facility from
January 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.l) was placed for collection in March 2014. (GE 3.)
In January 2018, Applicant left his previous job, and he and his then cohabitant
girlfriend relocated. He spent about 30 days settling in and then had temporary work for an
architect  until  mid-March  2018.  From  April  2018  to  early  July  2018,  Applicant  was
employed  about  30  hours  a  week  at  $15  an  hour  for a  company  updating  their  social
media. When Applicant and his now ex-girlfriend’s lease ended in approximately June
2018,  Applicant  moved  in  with  a  roommate,  to  whom  he  paid  rent.  (Tr.  63.)  Applicant
worked as a waiter for a local restaurant from July 2018 until February 10, 2019, when he
was laid off. (Tr. 53.) His income averaged $500 a week (Tr. 63), although he also testified
that work was “super super slow” from December to February 2019. (Tr. 53.) Applicant also
worked for company X on some technical tasks for about 40 hours total in 2018. (Tr. 27.)
A check of Applicant’s credit on October 24, 2018, showed that he owed $257 in
collection  debt  for cable  services  incurred  in  October 2017  (SOR  ¶  1.a). A  credit-card
account that he had opened in November 2017 to improve his credit score became past
due in March 2018 and was charged off for $120 (SOR ¶ 1.b). (GE 4.) Applicant testified
that  he  closed  out  his  cable  service  account  before  he  moved  and  was  under  the
impression that he did not owe a balance. Applicant testified that after his work for a local
architect “kind of dried up,” he was not able to pay the credit-card debt. (Tr. 42.)
On  November  28,  2018,  Applicant  entered  into  a  rehabilitation  program  for  his
defaulted Federal student loans, which had accrued with interest and fees to $59,245.3
Based on his reported adjusted gross income of $14,406 in 2018, Applicant was required
to  make  monthly  payments  of  only  $5  for  at  least  nine  consecutive  months  starting
November  29,  2018.  Once  his  student  loans  are  rehabilitated,  they  will  be  sold  or
2 Equifax was reporting Applicant’s February 2003 Federal student loan as past due for $1,429 as of February
2012 and as past due for $19,823 as of November 2017. SOR ¶ 1.k alleges an earlier balance of the Federal
student loan in SOR ¶ 1.c and is not an additional student loan.
3 The account numbers for the seven student loans covered by the rehabilitation program match those of the
loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c-I.i, which is also another indication that the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k is an earlier
balance of the loan in SOR ¶ 1.c.
transferred  to  a  new  loan  holder  or  loan  servicer,  and  he  will  be  required  to  select  a
repayment plan, which could be an income-based repayment plan. (AE A.) As of April 10,
2019, Applicant had made his payments in November 2018, December 2018, March 2019,
and April 2019. (AEs F-G.) He contacted the loan rehabilitation service to make a payment
by telephone in January 2019, but his payment was not processed. When he tried to make
his February 2019 payment, he was advised that his program had lapsed because there
was no record of a payment for January 2019. He had to restart the rehabilitation program
with his March 2019 payment. (Tr. 38-40, 58.) Applicant had no explanation for his failure
to address his student loans when he was employed full time in the past. (Tr. 61.)
Applicant  had  no  income  for  two  to  three  weeks  after  he  was  laid  off  from  the
restaurant job in February 2019. He collected unemployment benefits at $340 per week
from late February 2019 to early April 2019. (Tr. 54, 61.) On April 8, 2019, Applicant began
a 30-day temporary assignment for company X at $30 an hour. The job was expected to
net him $3,639 in wage income. (AE H; Tr. 24-26.)
On April 8, 2019, Applicant paid $207 in full settlement of the $296 debt in SOR ¶
1.l. (AE D; Tr. 34.) On April 9, 2019, Applicant paid $80 toward the cable services debt
(SOR ¶ 1.a) (AEs B-C; Tr. 30), and $50 toward the $222 state debt (SOR ¶ 1.j). (AE E.) He
plans to make payments on those debts until they are fully satisfied. (Tr. 30, 35, 57.) On
April 10, 2019, Applicant paid the $120 credit-card debt in full. (AE B; Tr. 30, 56.)
Applicant testified at his hearing that he tried several times since mid-March 2019 to
reach the entity collecting the judgment debt in SOR ¶ 1.m. As of April 2019, he had no
repayment plan in place for that debt. Applicant does not want to promise payments that he
then cannot afford. (Tr. 44-45, 58.)
Company X invested training dollars for Applicant to gain knowledge of the space-
management software needed for his temporary assignments. Company X management
personnel attest that Applicant was very reliable and responsive in producing high quality
products  on  schedule  to  meet  customer  delivery  requirements.  (AEs  H,  I.)  Applicant
provided the SOR to company X’s facility security officer (FSO). She met with him four
times about his financial issues. Applicant has expressed to her his intention to repay his
debts,  and  that  full-time  employment  with  the  defense  contractor  would  give  him  the
income needed to move forward in that regard. (AE H; Tr. 24-26.)
Since February 2019, Applicant has been sleeping on friends’ couches to get by
because his income was insufficient to obtain an apartment. (Tr. 55.) He gives his friends
between $50 and $100 a week to cover their electricity or Internet costs. His contribution
depends on his own expenses for food, gasoline, car insurance, and job search. He paid
off a couple of parking tickets during the first week of April 2019 and so gave his friends
only $50 to $60 that week.  Applicant drives a 2003 model-year vehicle and pays $80 a
month for car insurance. (Tr. 62.)
