In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and was
relieved of his dischargeable debts in 2015. (SOR ¶ 1.a) He denied that he failed to file
federal  income  tax  returns  and  to  pay  income  taxes  for  tax  years  2004  through  2014,
and 2016. (SOR ¶ 1.b) He claimed that those tax returns were filed with the bankruptcy
court as part of the bankruptcy court filing requirements. He also denied that he failed to
file and pay federal business taxes as required since tax year 1995. (SOR ¶ 1.c)
Applicant  admitted  that  he  owes  the  Federal  Government  over  $2  million  for
delinquent  business  taxes  (SOR  ¶  1.d);  and  that  he  is  indebted  to  the  Federal
Government  for  three  tax  liens  filed  against  him  in  2008  for $148,104  (SOR  ¶  1.e);  in
2008  for  $24,185  (SOR  ¶  1.f);  and  in  2009  for  $4,176  (SOR  ¶  1.g).  Applicant’s  SOR
admissions, and those at the hearing, are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a
thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  61-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  graduated  from
high school in 1976, and attended college for some time, but did not earn a degree. He
enlisted  in  the  U.S.  Navy  in  1976  and  served  until  1982.  He  was  discharged  “for  the
convenience  of  the  government,”  as  a  machinist  mate  fireman  apprentice  (E-2),  after
some  alcohol-related  misconduct.  He  believes  that  he  possessed  a  secret  clearance
during his service, but he is not sure. (GE 4) This is his first application for a clearance
since 1982.
Applicant married in 1983 and divorced in 1984; he married in 1984 and divorced
in 1994; and he married in 1996 and divorced in 2004. He is currently living with one of
his ex-wives. He has one son, age 18.
In  his  response  to  Section  26  (Financial  Record)  of  his  2017  SCA,  Applicant
disclosed  that  he  filed  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  2015  and  was  relieved  of  his
dischargeable debts that same year. He noted that part of the debt he was attempting to
discharge  concerned  a  failed  business  and  “941  taxes,”  which  were  not  subject  to
discharge. (IRS Form 941 is used to report income taxes, Social Security, or Medicare
withheld  from  employee's  paychecks.  It  accounts  for  the  employer's  portion  of  Social
Security  or  Medicare  owed  to  his  employees.)  (Tr.  20)  Applicant  defrauded  his
employees,  (at  some  point,  he  had  500  employees)  and  the  U.S.  Government,  by
withholding  money  from  his  employees’  paychecks  to  pay  their  income  taxes,  Social
Security,  and  Medicare,  and  wrongfully  appropriating  the  employees’  withholdings  for
his own benefit.
Applicant further claimed that his 2011 through 2014 tax returns were rejected by
the IRS and he refiled them with his bankruptcy. He claimed he filed his 2015 tax return
as part of the bankruptcy. He stated that he failed to file his 2016 tax return and pay his
taxes,  because  he  was  “still  trying  to  finalize  bankruptcy,”  and  that  he  “will  set
appointment with local division to file and pay”. (GE 2)
During  the  2018  interview,  Applicant  claimed  he  was  working  with  the  IRS,  and
would  maintain  contact  with  it,  to  resolve  his  tax  problems.  He  stated  that  all  of  his
financial  problems  were  related  to  his  1995  failed  business,  and  that  his  failure  to  file
and  pay  personal  income  taxes  were  the  result  of  him  losing  all  of  the  money  he
invested and not having the financial means  to pay his personal taxes or his business
taxes. (GE 3)
The  record  evidence  shows  that  Applicant  failed  to  file  federal  income  tax
returns, and to pay his federal personal income taxes for tax years 2004 through 2014,
and  2016  through  2018.  He  failed  to  file  and  pay  federal  business  taxes  as  required
since  tax  year  1995.  He  owes  the  Federal  Government  over  $2  million  for  delinquent
taxes.  Additionally,  he  is  indebted  to  the  Federal  Government  for  three  tax  liens  filed
against him in 2008 for $148,104; in 2008 for $24,185; and in 2009 for $4,176. (Tr. 18-
22; GE 3)
Applicant  claimed  that  he  filed  income  tax  returns  for  some  of  the  tax  years
alleged in the SOR. However, he failed to submit documentary evidence to corroborate
his  claims  (IRS  tax  transcripts  for  the  years  in  question  or  copies  of  his  income  tax
returns). Applicant testified the last time he met with IRS representatives was in 2008.
(Tr.  22)  He  failed  to  submit  documentary  evidence  of  any  contacts,  negotiations,  or
payment  agreements  with  the  IRS,  or  of  having  completed  any  financial  counseling,
except for the financial counseling he received during the filing for bankruptcy. Applicant
did not meet with the IRS to file and pay his delinquent tax years as he promised to do
in his 2017 SCA. (Tr. 19)
Applicant  claimed  that  he  has  worked  in  the  health  care  and  defense  industry
most  of  his  life  safeguarding  classified  information.  He  stated  that  he  never  had  any
security-related  incidents  or  a  lapse  of  judgment  handling  classified  information.  He
believes  that  his  personal financial  issues  were  caused  by  his  business  problems.  He
considers himself a reliable person who follows rules and is able to safeguard classified
information.
Concerning  his  tax  liabilities,  Applicant  testified  that  he  has  exhausted  all
avenues  of  relief  with  the  IRS  and  he  has  not  been  able  to  come  to  a  repayment
agreement. He claimed that he has paid some taxes because he has withholdings from
his paycheck every pay period. He believes that he has demonstrated good-faith efforts
by  attempting  to  resolve  his  tax  problems  with  the  IRS.  He  noted  that  he  has  paid
hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars  in  attorney  fees  to  resolve  his  tax  problems  until  he
was unable to continue paying.
