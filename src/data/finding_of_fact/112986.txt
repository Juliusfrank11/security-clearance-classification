Applicant is 39 years old. He earned an associate’s degree in 2012, and claimed
he was 20 hours shy of earning a bachelor’s degree. He married in 2009, and has three
children; a one-year-old son, and two daughters, ages four and seven. Applicant enlisted
in  the  Air  National  Guard  (ANG)  in  2006,  and  he  received  an  honorable  discharge  in
December 2014. He is working as a cybersecurity analyst for a DOD contractor where he
has worked since 2017. His annual salary is $77,810, and his wife earns about $16,000
annually  as  a  part-time  paralegal.  Applicant  has  held  a  DOD  security  clearance  since
2007. (Tr. 7, 28, 32, 34-39, 54-, GE 1; AE C, AE E)
The  SOR  alleges  22  delinquent  student  loans  totaling  $60,649,  and  other  two
unpaid accounts totaling $651. In 2010, Applicant enrolled into a technical college and
accumulated  significant  student  loan  debt.  He  was  unable  to pay  on  his student  loans
with a growing family and limited income. His employer pays for his medical insurance,
but  Applicant  is  fully  responsible  for  his  family’s  medical  insurance,  which  costs
approximately  $13,000  annually.  In  2019,  Applicant  and  his  wife  joined  a  financial
counseling  course  through  their  church.  He  has  been  reading  the  Dave  Ramsey  book
and learning how to get out of debt, and how he can prepare a college savings plan for
their three children.  As recommended by the financial course, Applicant and his wife do
not  possess  any  credit  cards.  They  pay  cash,  or  use  their  debit  card,  for  all  of  their
expenses. Applicant and his wife have also learned how they can reduce their expenses
and follow a budget. (Tr. 36-38, 43-47, 62, 64-67; GE 1)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.v allege delinquent student-loan accounts totaling $60,649,
which were referred for collection. Applicant’s 2017 Federal tax refund of approximately
$3,400  was  intercepted  in  2018  and  applied  to  his  delinquent  student  loans.  In  2018
Applicant entered into a student loan rehabilitation program with the collection company.
He started making $50 monthly payments, and then he increased his monthly payments
to  $121.  In  April  2019,  Applicant’s  Federal  tax  refund  of  $6,228  was  intercepted  and
applied to his delinquent student loans. Applicant claimed that at the time his  2018 tax
refund was intercepted, he had already completed the student loan rehabilitation program
and his student loans were no longer in default. In June 2019, the collection company
referred  his  student  loans  to  a  different  creditor.  During  the  transfer  process,  the  new
creditor required him to make $5 payments for the months of June and July 2019. (Tr. 21-
25, 47-54, 59; SOR response)
The new creditor determined that Applicant was to pay $695 every month for his
rehabilitated student loans. Applicant testified that he could not afford this amount, and
asked  to  be  evaluated  for  an  income-driven  repayment  plan.  The  new  creditor  was
provided  with  his  tax  returns  and  monthly  expenses  in  order  to  initiate  a  new  monthly
payment schedule. A few days before his August monthly student loan payment was due,
Applicant was involved in an auto accident. He requested and received forbearance on
his student loan payments until October 2019. At the hearing, he provided documentation
that his current student loan balance was $58,920. Applicant also stated that by the end
of the week he expected to receive documentation from the creditor with the new monthly
payment schedule. Applicant timely submitted AE F after the hearing, which showed his
student  loans  were  in  good  standing  and  beginning  November  13,  2019,  his  monthly
payments will be approximately $259. Applicant’s student loans are in good standing and
he  took  responsible  action  with  the  creditor  to  obtain  an  affordable  payment  plan,  as
supported by his monthly budget. (Tr. 21-25, 47-54, 59; AE F, AE G)
SOR  ¶  1.w  alleges  an  unpaid  medical  account  for $337.  Applicant  believed  the
military  was  responsible  for  paying  this  expense.  He  provided  documentation  with  his
SOR  response  that  he  paid  this  debt  in  full  in  March  2019.  This  delinquent  medical
account is fully resolved. (Tr. 45-46; SOR response)
SOR ¶ 1.x alleges a delinquent cable utility account for $314. Applicant provided
documentation with his SOR response that he paid this debt in full in March 2019. This
delinquent cable utility account is fully resolved. (Tr. 46; SOR response)
Applicant  provided  a  character-reference  letter  and  his  current  employee
performance  appraisal  at  the  hearing.  A  former  supervisor  and  captain  in  the  ANG
reported  that  Applicant  was  vital  in  the  success  of  their  unit,  and  he  is  reliable  and
trustworthy. In addition, Applicant’s supervisor reported during the most recent appraisal
period that Applicant “is by far one of the top performing analysts.” (AE D, AE E)
