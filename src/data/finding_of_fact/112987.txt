In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted that he owed all of the debts alleged in
SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.m. He also provided mitigating information showing that the debt in SOR ¶
1.a  was  being  paid  by  monthly  installments.  Applicant’s  admissions  are  accepted  as
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 26-year-old security site supervisor for a government contractor. He
has never married and does not have any children. He attended four years of college, but
he does not possess a college degree. He intends to return to college once his student
loans  are  rehabilitated.  In  May  2015,  Applicant  left  college  and  began  full-time
employment as a security guard, but his income was insufficient to pay all of his monthly
expenses.  In  November  2016,  he  was  hired  by  his  current  employer  and  his  income
essentially  doubled.  Applicant  currently  resides  with  his  mother,  and  his  monthly  net
income is approximately $3,500. (Tr. 19-21, 23, 25-31; GE 1)
Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges  13  delinquent  debts,  11 of which  are  defaulted  student  loans.
The total amount of debt is $48,306, and the record establishes the status of Applicant’s
accounts as follows:
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  a  delinquent  loan  account  for  $524.  This  debt  resulted  from
Applicant’s purchase of a motorcycle after he left college in May 2015. He stated that he
was underemployed in 2015,  and he considered this as an irresponsible purchase. He
could not pay the monthly loan payments with his limited income. His mother was held
responsible  as  a  co-signer  on  the  loan.  In  2016,  she  filed  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy.
Applicant  could  have  allowed  the  motorcycle  to  be  repossessed,  but  he  decided  he
wanted to be responsible for his purchase. The bankruptcy trustee had the full motorcycle
loan  payment  of  approximately  $300  be  deducted  from  his  mother’s  pay  each  month.
Since 2016, Applicant has consistently repaid his mother every month for the motorcycle
loan payments. He provided documentation showing the loan account balance is $1,640,
which will be paid in less than one year. The March 2019 credit report showed this account
as “current – pays account as agreed.” (Tr. 16-19; GE 2; AE C; SOR Response)
SOR  ¶¶  1.b-1.k  allege  ten  defaulted  student  loans  with  the  U.S.  Department  of
Education  for  $45,090.  Applicant  received  a  student  loan  for  every  semester  he  was
enrolled  in  college.  He  was  underemployed  and  unable  to  make  the  student  loan
payments  after  he  left  college  in  2015.  In  December  2018,  Applicant  entered  into  a
student loan rehabilitation program. He has paid seven out of the required nine monthly
payments to have his student loans rehabilitated. Applicant provided documentation to
show he is current with the $513 monthly payments, which are automatically deducted
from his bank account. The delinquent student loans are being resolved. (Tr. 12-16, 22-
24, 31-33; AE A, AE B)
SOR  ¶  1.l  alleges  a  collection  account  owed  to  Applicant’s  college  for  $2,410.
Applicant  contacted  a  lawyer  two  weeks  prior  to  the  hearing  to  have  this  student  loan
account  consolidated  with  his  other  student  loans  in  the  rehabilitation  program.  The
student loan account will be added to his rehabilitation program in the near future.  (Tr.
22-23; SOR Response)
SOR  ¶  1.m  alleges  a  collection  account  owed  for  an  unpaid  credit  card  in  the
amount of $282. Applicant did not recognize this account, but stated it was his intention
to  pay  this  account  in  full  by  the  end  of  the  day.  No  supporting  documentation  was
provided during the 30-day period the record was held open. This debt is not resolved.
(Tr. 33-34)
Applicant  has  a  monthly  budget  in  place  and  lives  within  his  means.  He  has
managed to save about $3,000 in the event of an emergency. A co-worker and a former
supervisor of Applicant testified that he is a responsible employee. Applicant has been
promoted over the last three years due to his outstanding work ethic. The co-worker was
aware of Applicant’s financial difficulties with student loans, and believed Applicant was
diligently  working  to  resolve  the  issue.  He  recommended  Applicant  be  granted a  DOD
security clearance. (Tr. 34-35, 38-39, 44-46)
