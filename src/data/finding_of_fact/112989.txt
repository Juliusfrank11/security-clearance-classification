Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, except for SOR 1.p which he was unable
to locate, and which no longer appears on his credit report. He is a 31-year-old information
management officer employed by a U.S. defense contractor since April 2017. This is a
different contractor than originally sponsored his clearance (GE 1; Tr. Tr. 100-107). He
claims to have held an industrial clearance since 2006. He married in June 2016, and has
a 16-year-old stepchild. (GE 1).
The SOR alleges, and Government exhibits (GE 3-4) substantiate, 16 delinquent
debts  totaling  nearly  $39,000.  Applicant  admits  15  delinquent  debts  totaling  nearly
$38,000. It appears that SOR debts 1.f and 1.l are the same. Applicant claimed to have
settled the debt, but provided no corroboration.
Applicant reported SOR debt 1.b on his December 2016 clearance application (GE
1),  and  discussed  his  financial  problemsCincluding  the  SOR  debtsCduring  a  January
2018 interview with a Government investigator (GE 2), based on his March 2017 credit
report (GE 4). He stated he would investigate the allegedly delinquent accounts, and take
steps to address them. In fact, he had paid SOR debt 1.n in November 2017 [Answer
(letter from creditor}]. He obtained a copy of his credit report in summer 2018, but did not
otherwise take steps to address the remaining SOR debts until after he received the SOR.
His December 2018 credit report (GE 3) shows most of the SOR debts remain unresolved.
Enclosures  to  Applicant=s  Answer  show  that  in  February  2019,  he  reached  a
settlement agreement with SOR creditor 1.g, which was shown as paid in March 2019
(AE C, I). He reached a settlement with the same creditor for SOR 1.h in February 2019,
which was also shown as paid in March 2019 (AE E) In February 2019, Applicant reached
a settlement agreement witn SOR creditor 1.i, which was shown as paid in March 2019
(AE  J).  He  paid  SOR  creditor  1.j  in  February  2019  [Answer  (letter  from  creditor)]  In
February 2019, SOR creditor 1.m offered to settle the debt at a 45% discount. Applicant
annotated that offer to reflect six monthly payments of $140. Applicant documented an
April 2019 payment (AE D, H) and a May 2019 payment (AE H).
In March 2019, the SOR 1.c creditor offered to settle the debt for one lump-sum
payment, a 36-month plan, an 18-month plan, or pay the full amount with easy monthly
payments (AE A, G). Applicant stated that he opted to pay slightly more than the required
monthly payment, but did not document any payments. In September 2018, the SOR 1.d
creditor  offered  to  settle  the  debt  at  a  70%  discount.  (AE  B).  Applicant  negotiated  the
amount to an 80% discount, but did not authorize payments to begin until June 2019 (AE
F). In March 2019, the SOR 1.o creditor stated that it would no longer    pursue the debt,
and was returning the debt to the original creditor (Answer). Applicant claims the original
creditor now has no record of the debt.
Applicant claims, without corroboration, that he has tried to contact the remaining
creditors with varying degrees of success, largely with no response from the creditors. He
claimed to have paid SOR debt 1.k by check, but did not document the payment.
Although Applicant experienced brief periods of unemployment in June 2016 and
April 2017, he acknowledges that his financial problems are due to his inaction (Tr. 98).
He did not do what he was supposed to do when he was supposed to do it (Tr. 93). He
and his wife earn about $175,000 annually, and have about $2,000 positive monthly cash
flow. He has resolved to use his savings to address the remaining SOR debts (Tr. 88-90).
In addition to the thin documentation of his efforts to deal with the specific debts,
Applicant  documented  no  credit  or  financial  counseling.  He  submitted  no  budget.  He
submitted  no  work  or  character  references,  or  any  evidence  of  civic  or  community
involvement. His wife says he is frugal and trying to address their finances.
