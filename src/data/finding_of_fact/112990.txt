Applicant  is  a  29-year-old  mechanical  engineer  who  has  been  in  the  same
position  for  five  years.  In  2014,  he  graduated  with  a  mechanical  and  electrical
engineering technology degree from a leading U.S. university. He is presently preparing
to defend his master’s thesis in the same discipline at a nearby university. He is single
and has no children. He recently bought his own home. At issue are delinquent Federal
and state taxes owed for tax years 2016 and 2017, amounting to about $32,500.
During  his  first  year  as  a  defense  contractor  at  his  present  job,  Applicant  was
paid by a governmental entity:
an  untaxed,  unreported  monthly  stipend  with  stipulations,  strict
stipulations,  that  [he]  was  not  employed  in  any  way  and  [he]  was  not
receiving a wage. When [he] tried to file [taxes] in 2017, [he] tried to file for
an extension, but because [he] had missed the 2016 deadline, [he] wasn’t
able to file that extension.  And that compounded the problem. This made
filing taxes very difficult and confusing for an engineer, and [he] ended up
missing a 2016 tax deadline.  (Tr.9)
In 2017, Applicant hired a CPA to complete his 2016 and 2017 tax year filings and set
up  payment plans.  (Tr.  9) In  the  interim,  Applicant  became an  employee  of  a different
employer that provides regular tax documentation and withholdings. During this time, he
was applying for a security clearance. As noted below, he ultimately instituted automatic
payments on his tax obligations in the autumn of 2018.
With  regard  to  the  approximately  $21,148  Applicant  owed  to  the  Internal
Revenue  Service  (IRS)  for  Federal  taxes  for  tax  years  2016  and  2017,  Applicant  has
paid this tax liability. (Tr. 19-23; Exs, F-G) He first began addressing the balances on or
before  October  2018  through  automatic  monthly  installment  payments.  (Tr.  22-23)
Payments  were  thus  made  until  April  2019,  at  which  point  the  reduced  balance  was
completely satisfied by one payment made with the proceeds of a personal loan. That
loan  is  to  be  repaid  over  the  next  15  years  at  the  rate  of  $700  a  month.  (Tr.  21)
Applicant has had a zero balance owed to the IRS since April 2019.
As  for  the  delinquent  debt  owed  to  his  state  for  tax  years  2016  and  2017
reflecting  a  balance  of  about  $11,572,  Applicant  provided  a  July  2,  2019,  state  tax
document  reflecting  that  the  tax  years at  issue  have  no  outstanding  balance,  and  that
he owes no state taxes. (Tr. 24; Ex. E) This sum was also satisfied from the proceeds of
his  loan  after  he  made  regular  monthly  installment  payments  from  October  2018
through March 2019, with his receipt of the SOR occurring between the last two monthly
$1,000  installments.  (An  April  2019  installment  for  $1,000  was  refunded  when  it  was
deposited after the personal loan had already satisfied the debt. (Tr. 46))
When  all  his  tax  balances  were  satisfied  in  March  2019  with  proceeds  from  his
personal loan, Applicant searched for a house. He was pre-approved for a mortgage in
April 2019. (Tr. 46) He also timely filed his Federal and state tax year 2018 obligations,
for which he owed approximately $6,000 and $5,500, respectively. (Ex. 26-27) In June
2019,  he  bought  a  home  valued  at  about  $200,000  with  around  $8,000  down,  then
satisfied his tax year 2018 tax liabilities. (Tr. 29; Exs. I-J)
Every  two  weeks,  Applicant  is  paid  a  salary  of  about  $2,000.  His  monthly
mortgage  is  almost  $1,600,  all  inclusive  of  taxes,  insurance,  and  fees.  He  has  no  car
payment on his hybrid vehicle. He spends about $250 for food and utilities, $400 on his
student  loan,  and  up  to  $500  a  month  on  any  credit  card  balances.  Consequently,  he
has  about  $300-$700  a  month  to  reserve  for  savings.  (Tr.  36-37)  He  presently  has
almost  $9,000  in  his  checking  and  savings  accounts,  plus  an  actively  open  401(k)
account. While  recommended,  he has  not  pursued financial  counseling  through  a  free
or  commercial  entity.  Going  forward,  he  plans  to  pay  off  his  personal  loan,  make
progress  on  his  student  loans,  and  seek  a  refinance  on  his  home  mortgage  to  seek
better terms. To do so, he uses a budget. (Tr. 40) Both parties in this matter agree that
he has mitigated the security concerns raised under ¶ 20(b) of Guideline F. (Tr. 47)
