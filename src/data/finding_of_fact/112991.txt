Applicant  is  a  47-year-old  human  resources  manager,  employed  by  a  defense
contractor  since  2012.  She  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1999  and  is  working  on  a
master’s degree. She married in 2000 and has one child. She does not currently hold a
security clearance.
The SOR alleges nine delinquent debts and a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, filed in 2010
and discharged in 2015. In all, the SOR alleges $38,423 in delinquent debts, including a
Federal  tax  lien  filed  in  2010  totaling  $28,805,  and  a  student  loan  collection  account
totaling $6,814. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except for SOR para. 1.b
(collection for a phone service provider) and SOR para. 1.c (collection for a cable service
provider).  The  SOR  debts  are  supported  by  substantial  evidence  in  the  record  and
Applicant’s admissions where appropriate.
In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant noted that her spouse lost his job in 2010,
and could not find similar paying work. As a result of the loss of income, Applicant claims
they were unable to meet their financial obligations and were forced to file Chapter 13
bankruptcy. The bankruptcy included $193,576 in unsecured claims, including $21,579 in
unpaid Federal income taxes and $8,322 in state income taxes for years 2007 and 2008;
and $13,684 in unpaid state income taxes for tax years 2003, 2006, and 2007. The IRS
report shows $36,703 in Federal taxes and $27,081 in state taxes were paid through the
Chapter 13  plan.  Applicant  claimed that  they  discovered their tax  liability  in  2010.  She
said the unpaid tax liabilities resulted from her husband under withholding from his pay.
The  bankruptcy  was  discharged  in  December  2015.  The  record  shows  a  2010
Federal tax lien for $28,805 remains on Applicant’s record. (SOR para. 1.e) Applicant has
not provided documentary evidence that the tax lien was released, despite an opportunity
to do so in response to the Government’s FORM.
Applicant claimed in her Answer to the SOR, that she is “currently” disputing the
debts alleged in SOR paras. 1.b and 1.c, but did not provide documentary evidence of
the disputes or evidence of their current status. Applicant provided evidence that the debt
alleged  in  SOR  para.  1.d  (unpaid  home  owners  association  fees)  has  been  resolved.
Applicant’s credit report shows the debts listed in SOR paras. 1.f – 1.i became delinquent
in  2017.  She  claimed  the  debts  resulted  from  her  involvement  in  an  auto  accident  in
September 2017; however, it is not clear why her auto accident injury prevented her from
paying her debts. Applicant provided some evidence of payments toward debts alleged
in SOR paras. 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i made in 2018 and 2019, but the status of the debts alleged
in SOR paras. 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, and 1.j is unknown. SOR para. 1.j alleges a student loan in
collection, totaling $6,814. Applicant claimed that this debt should have been consolidated
with other student loan debts, but was not. She stated in her Answer to the SOR that she
was investigating the account, but did not provide documentary evidence of a satisfactory
resolution of the collection account.
Applicant did not submit evidence that she independently sought credit counseling
to assist her with her delinquent debts, although it is presumed that she completed the
credit counseling required by bankruptcy courts before filing a petition. There is no record
evidence  showing  Applicant’s  current  income,  debts,  and  her  ability  to  meet  financial
obligations.
Law and Policies
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484  U.S.  518, 528  (1988). As  Commander in  Chief,  the President  has  the  authority  to
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is  clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An
administrative  judge  must  consider  a  person’s  stability,  trustworthiness,  reliability,
discretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG para. 1(b).
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the
possible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant
has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the  President  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  have
established for issuing a clearance.
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the
personal or professional history  of  the applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant from
being  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information.  The  Government  has  the  burden  of
establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531.
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v.
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria
listed  therein  and  an  applicant’s  security  suitability.  See  ISCR  Case  No.  92-1106 at 3,
1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).
Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the
facts. Directive E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG para. 1(d).
