1Consisting  of  the  transcript  (Tr.),  Government  exhibits  (GE)  1-3,  hearing  exhibit  (HE)  I,  and  Applicant
Exhibits  (AE)  A-C.  AE  A-C  were  timely  received  post  hearing.  The  record  closed  24  July  2019,  when
Department Counsel stated no objection to Applicant=s evidence.
2DoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February
20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective on
8 June 2017.
Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations.  He is a  50-year-old  network technician
pending a pre-employment clearance decision since November 2016. He claims to have
held a clearance in February 2002 and to have undertaken a polygraph examination in
December 2006.
The  SOR  alleges,  Government  exhibits  substantiate,  and  Applicant  admits  five
delinquent  debts  totaling  over  $24,000.  The  debts  comprise  $15,110  of  delinquent
education  loans,  $8,200  in  delinquent  condominium  fees,  a  delinquent  telephone
account, and two delinquent medical bills. He has been married since 1997. His wife is a
teacher.
Applicant reported the delinquent education loans and two other detbs not alleged
in the SOR on his November 2011 clearance application (GE 1). He discussed the SOR
debts  during  interviews  with  a  Government  investigator  in  June,  August,  and  October
2017. Applicant acknowledged the delinquent debts and stated his intent to investigate
the current status of the debts and make payment arrangements (GE 2). Nevertheless,
Applicant=s December 2018 credit report (GE 3) reflects that the debts remain unresolved.
Applicant  testified  that  except  for  the  SOR  1.b  debt,  he  has  not  contacted  any  of  his
creditors.
AE A is an undated account transaction report showing some payments between
December 2018 and 2019 on an account that Applicant states is his home loan, but which
is otherwise unidentified, and is nevertheless not alleged in the SOR. AE B is a similar
undated  report  that  Applicant  states  is  a  credit  union  loan,  but  which  is  otherwise
unidentified,  and  is  nevertheless  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  However,  the  documents
highlight the difficulty Applicant has had getting his finances in order. AE C documents a
$2,000 payment made to the SOR 1.b creditor in June 2019. Applicant stated that with
additional fees and penalties, this payment was unlikely to have lowered the balance due
alleged in the SOR.
Applicant  attributes  his  financial  problems  to  his  being  unemployed  August-
October 2012, at a time when he was making about $90,000 annually. He then worked a
series  of  lesser jobs  that  reduced  his income  to about  $15,000  annually.  However, he
was  laid  off  from  his  original  clearance  sponsor  when  the  contract  expired,  and  was
unemployed  April-December  2018.  His  current  employer  pays  him  about  $50,000
annually, but is not his current clearance sponsor.
In addition to not providing any evidence of efforts to deal with the specific debts,
Applicant has not received any credit or financial counseling. He does not have a budget.
His  long-time  friend  and  former  coworker  considers  him  honest  and  trustworthy,  and
recommends him for his clearance. He is generally aware of the security concerns. (Tr.
