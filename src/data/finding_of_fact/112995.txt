Applicant is 40 years old and has worked as manufacturing engineer for a defense
contractor since April 2017. He has been married since 2000, and he and his wife have
five children. Applicant received an associate’s degree in 1998. (Item 3)
Applicant  was  unemployed from May  2001  to  August  2001,  September 2002  to
November 2002,  January  2003  to  March  2003,  December 2011  to  January  2011, and
April 2013 to February 2014. Additionally, at an undisclosed date he took a reduction in
pay  from  $72,000  to  $55,000  to  keep  a  former  position  and  prevent  unemployment.
Finally, Applicant had a significant medical bill from June 2011 that was not covered by
his insurance. (Item 3; Item 6; Answer)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  has  twenty  delinquent  debts,  totaling  almost
$35,000.  The  debts  became  delinquent  between  approximately  2009  and  May  2018.
Applicant admitted all of the alleged debts in his Answer. (Answer; Item 3; Item 4; Item 5;
Item 6)
SOR 1.a. Applicant asserted in his Answer that he reduced the outstanding $3,332
judgment to $100. He did not provide supporting documentation. (Answer, Item 4; Item 5;
Item 6)
SOR 1.c. Applicant originally fell behind on his home mortgage in 2014 as a result
of a period of unemployment. He was able to refinance his home in February 2016, and
resolved the outstanding balance of almost $9,000. However, the November 2018 credit
bureau  report  showed  that  the  account  was  past  due  in  the  amount  of  approximately
$3,026,  and  the  total  outstanding  balance  was  $135,384.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant
asserted  that  he  had  reduced  the  past  due  amount  to  $894,  but  he  did  not  provide
supporting documentation. (Answer; Item 2; Item 3; Item 6)
SOR  1.l.  This  $4,486  medical  debt  was  not  covered  by  Applicant’s  insurance
company  due  to  a  preexisting  condition.  It  was  incurred  in  approximately  June  2011.
(Answer; Item 3; Item 5)
In  his  Answer,  Applicant  provided  no  additional  information  regarding  the
remaining SOR allegations, but stated that the delinquent and outstanding debts were the
result of periods of unemployment and a reduction in pay, as discussed above. He did
not  provide  any  supporting  documentation  in  his  Answer,  nor  did  he  respond  to  the
FORM.
