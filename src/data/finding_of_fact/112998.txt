Applicant admitted in part the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a, and denied the allegations
in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c (Answer).
Applicant is 61 years old. He has been married three times. He was married to his
first wife from 1987 to 1990 and was married to his second wife from 1992 to 2007. He
has been married to his third wife since 2010. He has two children from his first marriage
and two stepchildren from his second marriage. In 1981, he earned a bachelor’s degree
and in 1997, he earned a master’s degree. (Tr. 30; GE 1, GE 7) In 1999, he enrolled in a
doctoral program. (Tr. 48; GE 6)
Applicant enlisted in the Army in 1981 and retired as a Major in 2001. After retiring
from  the  Army,  he  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  from  2001  to  2011.  He  obtained
another contractor position where he worked until being laid off in 2013, due to a lack of
work.  He  then  started his own  company  and  was  self-employed until  November 2014,
when  he  began  his  current  position  with  a  defense  contractor.  In  October  2016,  he
submitted  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA).  He  held  a  security  clearance  while
serving in the Army and continuously since retiring from the Army (Tr. 24-29, 58; GE 1,
GE 7) Applicant worked as a part-time adjunct instructor for a local university from 2001
to 2007. (Tr. 64; GE 1, GE 7)
Applicant acknowledged he was fully employed from 2006 through 2012, and then
experienced a year or two of unemployment and underemployment until November 2014.
Since  then,  he  has  been  gainfully  employed.  (Tr.  79)  He  reported  an  adjusted  gross
income (AGI) of $173,532 for 2016. (AE A: Encl. 2) His AGI was $150,374 for 2017. (AE
A: Encl: 3) Applicant earned $154,565 while working overseas in 2018. After  excluding
$131,176 as foreign income for purposes of paying U.S. taxes, his AGI was $43,963 for
2018. (AE A: Encl. 4)
Applicant owns two pieces of property in the United States. In 2007 or 2008, after
his  divorce,  he  purchased  a  home  in  State  1  for  $319,000.  He  thinks  he  has  about
$150,000 of equity in that home. He and his wife own a home they purchased in 2012 for
$530,000 in State 2. It is on the market for $700,000. He has about $300,000 in equity in
that home. Both houses are being rented while he and his wife reside overseas. (Tr. 30,
60-62)
Since  December 2017,  Applicant  and  his wife  have  lived  in  Germany  where  he
works. His employer pays his housing costs in Germany. (Tr. 59, 62-63)
SOR (1.a) 2006 Tax Lien
After  Applicant  and  his  second  wife  divorced  in  April  2007,  he  obtained  an
extension of time to file his 2006 Federal income tax return to October 2007. (Tr. 31; GE
1) He filed it in May 2008, as noted below. (AE A: Encl. 1)
In his October 2016 SCA, Applicant disclosed his unpaid 2006 Federal income tax
debt that totaled about $40,000. In March 2012, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed
a tax lien for $64,688. During his August 2018 interview, Applicant told an investigator
that he entered into an installment agreement with the IRS to pay $350 per month on the
debt  in  July  2012,  around  the  time  his  income  was  decreasing.  The  agreement  was
suspended in mid-2013 because he did not have a steady income. He explained that he
was subsequently apprehensive about entering into another agreement until he secured
a steady contract. He also told the investigator that the IRS had applied about $12,000 of
tax refunds for tax years 2012 to 2015 to his 2006 tax debt. (GE 1) He stated that his tax
liability for 2006 was about $40,000, and fees and interest were about $24,000. (GE 7)
The following information is listed on the IRS account transcript of Applicant’s 2006
tax return (AE A: Encl. 1):
Applicant’s adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2006 was $143,360.
On  November  19,  2007,  the  IRS  sent  Applicant  an  inquiry  for  “non-filing  of  tax
return.” Applicant testified he did not remember receiving this notice. (Tr. 68)
On May 29, 2008, Applicant filed a return and it was processed on June 23, 2008.
Applicant testified that he had to refile it and make a change to his filing status due
to his divorce. (Tr. 65-67)
On  February  16,  2009,  the  IRS  notified  Applicant  that  he  owed  an  additional
$34,948  in  taxes,  penalties,  and  interest  charges  related  to  the  late  filing  of  his
2006 return. Applicant testified that he does not remember receiving this notice.
(Tr. 68)
On  March  7,  2010,  the  IRS  confirmed  that  it  received  Applicant’s  refiled  return.
Applicant testified that he remembered refiling the return at this time. (Tr. 32-34,
68-69)
On May 10, 2010, the IRS notified Applicant that it assessed a penalty for the late
payment of his 2006 taxes. Applicant testified that he does not remember receiving
this notice. (Tr. 68) He acknowledged that he resided at the same home from 2007
through 2010. (Tr. 70)
On April 22, 2011,  the IRS noted that  Applicant filed an amended tax return for
2006.
Applicant testified that he did not become aware that he owed the IRS a significant
amount of money until 2011, around the time he filed the amended return. (Tr. 71)
On May 9, 2011, the IRS issued Applicant a notice about reducing or removing the
penalties for filing late and the late payment of his 2006 taxes.
On June 7, 2011, the IRS issued Applicant a notice of its intent to levy.
On June 15, 2011, the IRS confirmed that Applicant received the above levy notice.
On  July  16,  2011,  Applicant’s  attorney  submitted  an  offer  in  compromise  to  the
IRS to resolve the taxes.
On March 2, 2012, the IRS rejected Applicant’s offer in compromise and filed a tax
lien for 2006 in the amount of $64,688 against Applicant. Applicant testified that
this tax liability arose because he underpaid his 2006 taxes while in the process of
divorcing. (Tr. 35, 74)
On January 4, 2013, Applicant’s attorney submitted another offer in compromise
to the IRS. It was accepted by the IRS on January 28, 2013.
On  April  28,  2014,  the  IRS  noted  that  Applicant’s  payment  agreement  was  no
longer in effect.
During his August 2018 interview, Applicant said he made payments on his first
installment plan for several months. (GE 7) Applicant testified that he was laid off
between  2013  and  2014,  and  stopped  making  payments  because  he  could  not
afford them. (Tr. 36)
On  September  15,  2014,  the  IRS  noted  that  the  tax  balance  was  currently  not
collectible.
No  installment  payments  are  recorded  in  the  IRS’  account  transcript  from  2012
through 2015.
On June 20, 2016, the IRS noted that the account is currently collectible.
On April 15, 2017, the IRS credited Applicant’s unpaid 2006 taxes with a two-dollar
overpayment from his 2016 taxes.
On April 15, 2018, the IRS credited Applicant’s tax overpayment of $3,475 for 2017
to his 2006 tax liability.
On August 15, 2018, Applicant entered a second installment agreement with the
IRS to pay his 2006 tax debt balance of $22,654.
The  IRS’  transcript  recorded  payments  of  $493  in  October  2018  and  $600  in
November and December 2018. It also recorded payments of $1,200 from January
through  March  2019.  Applicant  presented  evidence  that  he  made  payments  of
$1,200 from April through July 2019. (AE A: Encls. 1, 5, 8, 9)
In July 2019, the IRS credited Applicant’s 2018 tax overpayment of $6,354 to his
2006 tax liability. (AE A: Encl. 7)
On  August  9,  2019,  Applicant  made  a  $1,200  payment  on  his  2006  tax  debt
balance of $3,415, leaving about $2,200 remaining unpaid. (Tr. 40-41; AE A: Encls. 9,
10)
Applicant testified that the first payment he ever made to the IRS on his 2006 tax
debt  was  in  October  2018,  when  he  started  the  second  installment  payment  plan.  He
clarified that he had not made payments on the initial installment agreement because he
was laid off soon after he negotiated it. (Tr. 71-74) He stated that he purposely did not
take exemptions for each year after 2012 because he wanted to create a refund that the
IRS  would  credit  to  his  2006 unpaid  taxes.  His  strategy  was  to  overpay  his taxes  in  a
current tax year and apply that overpayment to the 2006 tax liability. (Tr. 73) No tax credits
are recorded on Applicant’s 2006 IRS account transcript for tax years 2012 to 2015. (AE
A: Encl. 1)
During  his  August  15,  2018  interview,  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  recently
contacted  the  IRS  to  establish  a  payment  plan  for  his  2006  tax  debt  in  order  to  avoid
delaying  his  security  clearance  renewal.  (GE  7)  In  fact,  he  and  his  wife  signed  that
installment agreement with the IRS the same day as his August 2018 interview. (AE A:
Encl.  5)  While  testifying,  he  again  confirmed  that  this  security  clearance  investigation
prompted him to initiate the payment plan with the IRS to pay his $22,654 outstanding
2006 tax debt. (Tr. 77-78)
Applicant stated that he was unable to pay his 2006 tax sooner because he did not
have enough money and could not use equity in his property to do so. He said he could
not obtain a home equity loan on either property he owned because his first residence
decreased in value while he lived there between 2007 and 2011, and his second home
did not increase appreciably. Additionally, his banks would not authorize a home equity
loan for any residence that was not their primary home or being rented. (AE: D: Encl. 2)
SOR (1.b) 2017 State Tax Lien
In 2013, Applicant and his wife were notified by a state revenue agency that they
had an outstanding tax liability for 2012. (Tr. 81) In May 2017, the state filed an $8,106
tax lien for the unpaid 2012 taxes.
Applicant testified that he did not learn about this tax debt until he received the lien
notice in May 2017. Subsequently, he did not monitor resolution of the tax debt because
he  thought  his  wife  was  addressing  it  through  automatic  deductions  of  $250  from  her
salary. As a consequence, he believed he was not responsible for paying it although he
understood it was a joint debt. He said that when the 2012 taxes were due in 2013, he
was not fully employed, but his wife was working. He presented evidence that she made
payments from October 2017 to April 2018, at which time their bank stopped making the
automatic deductions, unbeknownst to her. He became aware that the taxes had not been
paid when he received the March 6, 2019 SOR. (Tr. 44-45, 81-86; AE B: Encl. 1) On April
9, 2019, Applicant’s wife withdrew money from their savings account and paid $8,106 to
the state, which was the final amount due on their 2012 state taxes. (Tr. 85; GE 5)
SOR (1.c) University Debt
In 1999, Applicant entered a doctoral program. He said he attended classes in the
spring and fall of 2000, and then withdrew because he was transitioning out of the military
into civilian life. He never returned to the school. He denied that he registered for classes
after completing the 2000 fall semester and disputed any allegation that he attended after
2000.  According  to  the  university,  Applicant  attended  classes  from  August  through
December of 2001, and January through March of 2002. In January 2003, the university
wrote  off  the  debt.  He  testified  that he  never received  a  bill from the  university  for the
alleged  amount.  Applicant  stated  that  he  has  gone  through  the  security  clearance
investigations twice before this proceeding as a civilian, and this debt never arose during
an investigation. (Tr. 48-52, 87-92; GE 6)
After  learning  of  this  debt  when  he  received  the  March  2019  SOR,  Applicant
contacted the university’s registrar for more information about  it. He said the university
registrar  told  him  that  the  accounting  system  changed  over  the  years,  which  made  it
difficult to accurately respond to his inquiry. He subsequently contacted his student loan
company, which said all of his loans were paid. (Tr. 52-55) On August 21, 2019, post-
hearing,  he  sent  a  letter  and  fax  to  the  university  inquiring  about  the  debt  and  asking
whether his student loans covered it this debt. (AE D: Encl. 1)
