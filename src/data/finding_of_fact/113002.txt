Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  in  the  SOR,  however  allegation  1.b.  was
withdrawn  by  the  Government.  (TR  at  page  37  line  2  to  page  38  line  17.)    After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 13 line
24  to  page  15  line  5,  and  GX  1  at  page  5.)  He  has  been  employed  with  the  defense
contractor for about “one and a half years.” Applicant retired from the U.S. Navy after 20
years of honorable service. (TR at page 12 line 23 to page 13 line 21.)  He has held a
security  clearance,  on  and  off,  since  about  1982.  (TR  at  page  14  lines  11~15.)  He  is
married,  and  attributes  much  of  the  alleged  medical  debt  to  his  wife  having  “Breast
Cancer and . . . severe Asthma.” (TR at page 18 line 21 to page 20 line 17.) However,
despite the admitted past-due indebtedness, Applicant took “out $12,000.00 out of . . .
[his]  401K  that  .  .  .  [he]  spent  .  .  .  from  March  through  April  [of  this  year]  on  various
things [a brand new stereo system]” and “a vacation in June [of this year].” (TR at page
33 line 11 to page 34 line 23.)
