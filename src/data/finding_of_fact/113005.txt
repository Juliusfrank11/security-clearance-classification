Applicant  is  a  63-year-old  program  analyst  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since December 2016. He has worked for federal contractors since May 2009, and he
has been a self-employed consultant since October 2005.
Applicant  married  in  June  1988  and  has  two  adult  children.  He  obtained  a
bachelor’s degree in January 1979, a master’s degree in December 1989, and a second
master’s degree in August 1993. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from April
1979 to January 2000 and retired as a lieutenant colonel. While he was on active duty,
he  was  a  healthcare  administrator.  (Tr.  32.)  He  currently  serves  as  a  subject-matter
expert  on  resource  sharing  between  governmental  agencies  on  health  care  for
veterans.  (Tr.  48.)  He  has  applied  for  and  received  eligibility  for  public  trust  positions
several  times.  He  held  a  security  clearance  and  eligibility  for  access  to  sensitive
compartmented information while on active duty.
The  SOR  alleges  a  single  delinquent  debt,  which  is  a  credit-card  account
charged off by the issuing bank for $30,625. Applicant opened the account in February
2000  but  rarely  used  it.  (GX  3  at  5;  Tr.  25.)  In  2009-2010,  he  incurred  a  substantial
federal  income-tax  debt  when  he  incorrectly  estimated  his  tax  liability  as  a  self-
employed  subcontractor.  He  used  the  credit  card  to  make  two  payments  of  past-due
federal income taxes in 2011 and 2012, and he began making monthly payments on the
credit-card account, which were about $1,000 per month. He closed the account in 2015
after  his  account  was  repeatedly  hacked,  but  he  continued  to  make  payments  on  the
balance due. (Tr. 27.) When he was interviewed during his background investigation in
May 2018, he admitted that he owed the amount claimed by the bank. (GX 2 at 5.)  At
the  hearing,  he  testified  that  all  the  fraudulent  charges  on  the  account  had  been
resolved, and he believed he owed the bank about $26,000 or $27,000. (Tr. 33-34.) He
did not submit any documentation of the basis for his computation.
In  2013,  Applicant  refinanced  his  home  to  obtain  a  lower  interest  rate,  and  his
lender  suggested  that he hire a debt-management  company  to  lower his payments on
the  credit-card  account.  In  October  2013,  he  hired  Company  A.  (AX  1.)  Company  A
advised Applicant to stop making payments to the  bank and start making payments to
them. Company A offered payments of about $503 for 42 months instead of the $1,000
per month that Applicant was paying the bank. (AX 8; Tr. 49.)
Applicant  received  several  delinquency  notices  from  the  bank,  which  he
forwarded to Company A. He contacted Company A, and a representative informed him
that  the  company  intended  to  accumulate  more  funds  before  starting  to  pay  the  bank.
(Tr. 28.) The bank charged off the account in December 2013. (GX 3 at 6.)
Applicant made  payments  to  Company  A from  November 2013  to  July  2015.  In
August 2015, he was notified that  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  had filed
an  action  against  Company  A  for  defrauding  its  customers  by  converting  funds  to  its
own  use  instead  of  paying  the  customers’  debts.  A  federal  district  court  appointed  a
receiver,  and  the  assets  of  Company  A  were  liquidated.  Applicant  had  paid  $9,934  to
Company A, and he received a settlement of $5,404. (AX 8-12.)
Applicant  did  not  submit  any  evidence  that  he  contacted  the  bank  directly  or
made  any  effort  to  resolve  the  debt  after  Company  A  was  liquidated.  On  January  3,
2019, shortly before receiving the SOR, Applicant hired Company B to help him resolve
the  credit-card  debt.  (AX  3.)  With  Company  B’s  assistance,  Applicant  contacted  the
bank  in  February  2019  and  again  in  March  2019,  requesting  the  bank  to  validate  the
debt. The bank responded, continuing its claim that the amount owed was $30,625. (AX
6; AX 7.) Company B sent additional letters to the bank in May 2019. Copies of the May
2019 letters are not included in the record. (AX 5 at 2.) Applicant testified that Company
B anticipates it will take 6 to 18 months to resolve the debt. (Tr. 36.) He testified that if
the debt is not resolved by July 2020, he will negotiate directly with the bank and either
pay  the  entire  $30,625  claimed  by  the  bank  or  any  lesser  amount  that  can  be
negotiated. (Tr. 37, 52.) He currently has about $26,000 in his bank account that he has
earmarked for payment of the debt. (AX 9.)
Applicant is financially secure. His current annual income is about $194,000, plus
his military retired pay of about $42,000 after taxes. His  wife earns about $45,000 per
year. Their two children are self-sufficient. (Tr. 39-42.)
When  Applicant  submitted  his  applicant  for  a  public  trust  position  in  February
2017,  he  answered  “No”  to  questions  whether,  during  the  last  seven  years,  he  had
defaulted on any type of loan; had any bills or debts turned over to a collection agency;
had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as
agreed;  or  had  been  more  than  120  days  delinquent  on  any  debt.  He  also  answered
“No”  to  a  question  whether  he  was  currently  more  than  120  days  delinquent  on  any
debt.
When  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in  May  2018,  the
investigator  confronted  him  with  a  credit  report  reflecting  that  the  credit-card  account
had been charged off, and Applicant explained why it had not been resolved. (GX 2 at
4-5.)  In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR  and  at  the  hearing,  he  stated  that  he  did  not
believe  the  debt  was  delinquent  because  he  had  been  making  payments  on  it  and
because  the  amount  of  the  debt  was  disputed.  He  testified  that  he  had  never  before
been  in  a  situation  where  he  was  paying  one  company  to  pay  off  a  debt  with  another
company  while  amount  of  the  debt  was  in  dispute.  He  had  not  seen  his  credit  report
before  he  was  interviewed  in  May  2018,  and  he  was  unaware  that  the  bank  had
charged  off  the  debt.  He  admitted  that  he  struggled  with  the  answers  to  the  financial
questions  in  his  application,  but  he  persuaded  himself  that  negative  answers  were
correct. (Tr. 52-54.)
