The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the February 6, 2019 SOR, Applicant
owed a $445 wireless phone debt in collection (SOR ¶ 1.a), and charged-off student loans
of $9,102 (SOR ¶ 1.b) and $19,552 (SOR ¶ 1.c). When Applicant responded to the SOR
allegations, she explained that she had been unaware of the wireless phone debt before
the SOR, but she has since paid it. She acknowledged the defaulted student loans, which
she obtained as a minor, and indicated that they have been taken on by her co-signer.
(Item 1.) After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 35-year-old defense-contractor employee seeking a DOD security
clearance. She has been working for her current employer as a contract administrator
since June 2014. Applicant was divorced in September 2015, after ten years of marriage.
She has two sons, ages 12 and 16. From July 2008 to March 2015, she resided with her
parents  and  then  with  her  older  sister,  so  she  and  her  ex-husband  may  have  been
separated well before their divorce, although it is unclear. (Item 2.)
Applicant pursued her undergraduate studies on and off from 2001 to May 2016,
when she earned her bachelor’s degree. She obtained approximately $72,000 in student
loans. Two of the loans, obtained for $4,500 in January 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.b) and $10,000 in
September 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.b), were co-signed. Seventeen other student loans were taken
on by Applicant individually. (Items 3-6.)
Applicant was a stay-at-home mother throughout 2007. In August 2008, she began
working as a part-time teacher’s assistant. In October 2011, she started caring for her
grandmother and son in the evenings and weekends, being paid for her services under a
state program. She continued to work part-time during the day at the school district until
October 2013, when she left that job to seek other employment. In June 2014, Applicant
began full-time employment with a defense contractor while continuing to be paid for her
work as a caregiver. (Items 2-3.)
On  June  29,  2017,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). She responded affirmatively to the
following financial record inquiry: “In the past seven (7) years, you had any account or
credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed? (Include
financial obligations for which you were the sole debtor, as well as those for which you
were a cosigner or guarantor).” She disclosed an outstanding $445 cellphone debt (SOR ¶
1.a) incurred because she lacked a steady income at the time to consistently pay for her
service. She gave an estimated date of September 2011 for the delinquency and indicated
that the debt may have been charged off. She admitted that she had taken no action to
resolve it. She listed no other past-due debts. (Item 2.)
As of July 12, 2017, Applicant had three outstanding collection debts on her credit
record. In addition to the $445 cell phone debt (SOR ¶ 1.a), which had been in collection
since December 2014, the two joint student loans from 2002 had been charged off in 2011
and were in collection for $9,102 (SOR ¶ 1.b) and $19,552 (SOR ¶ 1.c). Applicant’s other
student loans, with an aggregate balance then of $80,980, were deferred. She was making
timely payments on a car loan obtained for $23,891 in August 2014 (balance $13,532), and
on credit cards with balances of $2,252, $540, $307, and $1,248. (Item 4.)
On January 10, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). She admitted that the $445 wireless phone
delinquency had not been resolved. As for her two charged-off student loans, Applicant
admitted  that  she  had  not  contacted  the  loan  servicer  about  repayment  because  she
assumed that the debts would be removed from her credit record after the passage of time.
She lacked the steady income to consistently make payments on her student loans. Her
Federal student loans had been reported as past due in the summer of 2015. She disputed
the delinquency, and indicated that the loans were in deferment. She indicated that she
would arrange to begin repaying her student loans in 2018. She had not started to repay
any of her student loans or the wireless phone debt, citing limited income and her being a
single parent. She had not received any financial counseling, but she indicated that she
was living within her means. (Item 3.)
As of October 2018, the student loan delinquencies in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c were no
longer on her credit report. Her Federal student loans had reportedly been delinquent in
2015, but they were not currently past due. No payment amounts were shown on her credit
report, so it is likely that the loans were deferred. She was making timely payments of $385
on  a  new  car  loan  obtained  for  $12,366  (balance  $7,666)  in  September  2017,  after
satisfying  an  older  car  loan  from  2014.  Credit  card  balances  totaling  $6,167  and  an
unsecured loan obtained in June 2018 for $8,022 (balance $7,540) were being repaid on
time. (Item 5.)
As of March 12, 2019, the collection entity holding the wireless phone debt (SOR ¶
1.a) was reporting the debt as settled, but not the amount paid. Applicant asserts that she
paid  the  debt  in  full  after she  received  the  SOR.  Applicant  stated  that  the  charged-off
student loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d) “have been taken on by [her] co-signer.” (Item 1.)
Applicant presented no evidence of any payments or repayment arrangements by her or
her co-signer on the student loans.
As of April 17, 2019, Applicant’s other student loans were rated as current with a
total balance  of  $88,366.  Four loans with a $24,701  aggregate balance were rated as
current with a March 2019 date of last payment, although no actual payment was noted.
She  was  scheduled  to  make  $703  monthly  payments  toward  her  $63,665  in  Federal
student-loan balances. It is unclear whether she was making payments on her Federal
loans or whether they were deferred. The loan status for each loan was “pays accounts as
agreed,” but no actual payments were reported on her credit report. Applicant was making
timely payments on seven credit-card accounts on which she owed $15,263. In March
2019, she paid $1,125 toward a credit card that had a $91 monthly scheduled payment.
She was paying her September 2017 car loan and her June 2018 unsecured loan on time.
(Item 6.)
No information is in the record evidence about Applicant’s current income or her
monthly expenses, so a reasonable assessment of her financial situation is precluded.
