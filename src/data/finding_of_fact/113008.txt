Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  44  years  old.  He  earned  an  associate’s  degree  in  2007  and  a
bachelor’s degree in 2009. He never married. He has three children ages 19, 26, and 4
years  old.  He  served  in  the  military  and  was  honorably  discharged.  He  has  been
employed by federal contractors since 2007 and the same federal contractor since 2015.
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  in  May  2016.  In  it,  he
disclosed that he had delinquent student loans that were in collection status (SOR ¶ 1.a-
$40,114 and ¶ 1.c-$26,631). He stated: “monthly payment plan in process.” He further
stated: “I’ve set up monthly payment plans this will eventually pay this bill off.”  He also
disclosed that he has taken vacations on an island for six to ten days in 2014 and 2015.
(Item 2)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in September 2017. He
again  disclosed  his  delinquent  student  loans  and  told  the  investigator  that  he  had  not
made a payment since March 2016, but he was seeking a second job. In October 2018,
he was interviewed again and told the investigator that he was initiating a plan to pay his
student loans not later than November 2018. He said that he had secured a second job.
He attributed his financial problems to a period in 2016 when his children were no longer
living with him and his child support payments increased. (Items 3, 4)
Applicant stated in his March 2019 SOR answer, regarding the student loan debts
in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c that he was working on a payment plan with the creditor. He stated:
“I don’t have the information to send in today, but I will be able to send the information on
a  later  date.”  Applicant  was  afforded  that  opportunity  when  he  received  the  FORM  to
provide  information.  He  did  not  provide  additional  documentary  evidence  that  he  is
resolving his delinquent student loans. (Item 1)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he provided documentary proof that he paid the
collection  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.b;  settled  the  charged-off  debt  in  ¶  1.d;  paid  the  past-due
amount owed for the debt in ¶ 1.e; and his child support obligation was paid and resolved
(¶ 1.f). Applicant also provided a document to show the past-due amount owed for the
motorcycle he purchased in December 2015, was paid (¶ 1.g). (Item 1).
