Applicant is a 43-year-old logistics information technology task lead, employed by
a defense contractor since 2017. He received his first master’s degree in 2009, and his
second master’s degree in 2016. He served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from
his  enlistment  in  1994  until  he  retired  as  a  Chief  Warrant  Officer  3  in  2014.  He  was
previously married in 1996, but it was annulled in 1998. He remarried 2001 and has three
children, all teenagers that live with him. Applicant’s 2017 interim security clearance was
revoked in September 2019.
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy
in December 2018 that is pending; has two federal tax debts totaling $35,136 for tax years
2016 and 2017; and two state tax debts totaling $12,335 for tax years 2016 and 2017.
Applicant admitted the SOR allegations with explanations. Applicant filed his federal and
state tax returns on time, but did not have the funds to pay taxes owed.
Applicant opened a cigar lounge in 2014 that he sold for a profit in 2017. He then
opened a sandwich shop in 2017, but quickly changed it into a coffee shop. The same
year he opened another cigar lounge and barber shop, but all of the businesses closed
in 2018. These endeavors were unprofitable.
Applicant  consulted  a  bankruptcy  attorney  in  late  2018,  and  filed  a  Chapter  13
bankruptcy in December 2018. He listed total liabilities of $621,291 and was required to
pay  $221,110  under  a  Chapter 13  repayment  plan.  Applicant  was  unable  to  make  the
plan  payments,  and  in  August  2019,  he  was  notified  that  the  bankruptcy  would  be
dismissed if he did not convert it to a Chapter 7  bankruptcy or make the required plan
payments. Applicant testified that he expected the bankruptcy would be dismissed by the
end of September 2019.
As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  had  not  made  arrangements  to  pay
delinquent  federal  and  state  taxes,  and  while  the  bankruptcy  was  pending,  he  was
prevented  from  expending  funds  outside  the  bankruptcy  process.  Applicant’s  home  in
another  state  was  foreclosed  in  August  2019,  and  he  testified  that  he  may  owe  a
deficiency balance.
While  employed  with  his  current  employer,  Applicant  earns  a  combined  salary,
military  retirement,  and  veteran’s  disability  income  totaling  $182,000.  He  has  about
$2,200  in  savings.  In  testimony,  Applicant  took  full  responsibility  for  his  financial
predicament,  and  understands  the  security  concerns  his  financial  status  invokes.
Applicant’s colleagues and friends provided character letters attesting to his work ethic,
reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  dedication.  He  is  praised  for  his  military  service  and
performance  as  a  defense  contractor.  Applicant  received  court-mandated  financial
counseling before filing his bankruptcy petition.
Law and Policies
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484  U.S.  518, 528  (1988). As  Commander in  Chief,  the President  has  the  authority  to
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is  clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An
administrative  judge  must  consider  a  person’s  stability,  trustworthiness,  reliability,
discretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG ¶ 1(b).
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the
possible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant
has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the  President  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  have
established for issuing a clearance.
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the
personal or professional history  of  the applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant from
being  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information.  The  Government  has  the  burden  of
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. “Substantial
evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. Washington
Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a
nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the  criteria  listed
therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3
(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015).
Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG ¶ 1(d).
