Under Guideline F, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.j, 1.l-1.n, and 1.p; he denied
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.k, 1.o. 1.q, and 1.r; and he partially admitted and partially denied SOR ¶
1.a. I construe his answer to the falsification allegation under Guideline E (SOR ¶ 2.a) as
a denial. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful review of the record evidence, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 31 years old. He has been married for about 18 months. He has four
children  between  ages  9  and  14,  and  a  stepchild.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in
2007.  He  worked  for  a  defense  contractor at  a  naval  shipyard  from  2008  to  July  2017,
when  he  resigned  after getting  into  a physical altercation  with  a  co-worker.  He  testified
that  the  altercation  began  after  the  co-worker  called  Applicant  a  racial  epithet  during  a
dispute.  Applicant  resigned  instead  of  being  fired  so  he  could  maintain  a  right  to  be
rehired in the future. (GE 1, Tr. 20, 31-34)
Applicant  was  unemployed  until  he  began  working  for  his  current  employer  in
September  2017.  He  seeks  eligibility  for  a  position  of  public  trust  so  he  can  work  on
certain projects. He often travels to various sites around the country for his job. (GE 1;
Tr. 32-33, 64-65)
Applicant has lived in State 1 his whole life. The shipyard where he worked from
2008 to 2017 is located in State 2, within commuting distance. In 2013 and 2014, he kept
an apartment in State 2, though he did not formally move there. (Tr. 38-40)
The  financial  allegations  in  the  SOR  concern  certain  unfiled  state  and  Federal
income tax returns, some delinquent state and Federal income tax debt, and other debts
to private creditors. He disclosed child support debt and past-due state income taxes on
his SCA. (GE 1)
SOR  ¶¶  1.b  ($3,137),  1.c  ($2,381),  and  1.d  ($$1,890)  concern  State  1  tax  liens
issued against Applicant in 2014 and 2015. Applicant denied SOR ¶ 1.b, stating the debt
had been paid; he admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d. He  testified that all of these tax debts
were  resolved  through  garnishment  of  his  wages.  He  provided  documentation  of
garnishment  orders  from  State  1,  for  $4,232  (AE  B  -  AE  D)  and  $6,220  (AE  E).  He
testified that these garnishment orders resolved past-due state income tax debt from tax
years  2011-2014.  (Tr.  40-44,  49)  A  current  pay  stub  does  not  show  any  current
garnishments. (AE H)
Applicant testified that his tax issues occurred because he had state income taxes
taken out by State 2 when he was working there, even though he was living in State 1.
He believes he is owed money from State 2 due to tax overpayments or a tax credit, and
that those tax payments should have been directed to State 1. He had an accountant or
tax  preparer,  but  he  said  she  did  not  file  returns  with  State  1  for  several  years  (2011-
2015). (Tr. 44-47) Applicant did not believe that he could have fixed the problem through
his employer’s payroll office by telling them to withhold State 1 taxes (because he lived
there)  even  though  his  work  location  was  in  State  2.  (Tr.  47-49)  He  provided  an
“unclaimed property form” from the State 2 Treasurer’s office, which came with a $2,600
check  he  received  from  State  2.  He  said  it  was  reimbursing  him  for  State  2  taxes  that
were improperly collected. (Tr. 85-89; AE A)
The SOR also alleges that Applicant has unfiled State 1 income tax returns for tax
years 2011 and 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and an unfiled federal income tax return for 2016 as
well  (SOR  ¶  1.e).  Applicant  testified  that  his  2016  state  and  federal  returns  remain
unfiled  but  that  all  earlier  years  (2011-2015)  had  been  “filed.”  He  then  clarified  that  he
had  signed  returns  provided  to  him  by  his  tax  preparer,  but  the  returns  had  not  in  fact
been  “filed”  with  State  1.  He  believes,  however,  that  his  tax  preparer  filed  returns  with
State  2,  though  erroneously.  Applicant  provided  no  documentation  that  any  of  these
income tax returns either Federal or for State 1, have been filed, even belatedly. He said
he contacted the IRS about his 2016 return, and claimed to have gotten a filing extension
to September 2019. (Tr. 49-54)
Applicant  also  acknowledged  owing  about  $8,000  in  past-due  Federal  income
taxes.  (SOR  ¶  1.f)  He  said  he  was  told  by  the  IRS  that  he  had  to  file  all  his  past-due
returns before he could set up a payment plan. This debt is unresolved.
The  remaining  accounts  in  the  SOR  all  concern  past-due  debts  to  private
creditors. They include: $12,586, in collection (SOR ¶ 1.g); $11,541, charged off (SOR ¶
1.h); charged-off credit union account, for $1,194 (SOR ¶ 1.i);  charged-off account to a
furniture store, for $934 (SOR ¶ 1.j); $317, in collection; (SOR ¶ 1.k); $6,656 balance due
on  a  repossessed  auto  (SOR  ¶  1.l);  $1,228  past-due,  $2,674  total  balance  on  a  credit
union account (SOR ¶ 1.m); two accounts placed in collection by a satellite or cable TV
providers (SOR ¶ 1.n, for $525, and SOR ¶ 1.o, for $423); and a $192 debt in collection
to a power company. (SOR ¶ 1.p) These debts are reflected on Applicant’s March 2018
credit  report.  None  of  these  debts,  as  alleged,  have  been  paid  or  otherwise  resolved.
(GE 3; Tr. 56-63)
Applicant acknowledged that he incurred many of his debts when he was younger
and did not know any better. He also fell behind on his expenses during the short period
he was unemployed between jobs. (July to September 2017) (Tr. 35-36)
Applicant contacted the credit union related to SOR debts ¶¶ 1.i and 1.m, but has
not set up a payment plan. (Tr. 57) The debt at SOR ¶ 1.k is for a vehicle. Applicant fell
behind  on  payments  and  returned  the  car.  He  denied  the  debt  on  that  basis.  He  has
made no further payments. (Tr. 57-58)
As to SOR ¶ 1.l, Applicant was unable to make payments when the monthly fee
increased, so he returned the car. He was not aware that he owed a deficiency balance
until he saw the debt on his credit report. The debt is unresolved.  (Tr. 58-59) Applicant
has not made any arrangements to pay, dispute, or resolve the debts at SOR ¶¶ 1.n, 1.o,
or 1.p. (Tr. 61)
Applicant did not recognize the two past-due medical debts alleged. (SOR ¶ 1.q,
for $97, and SOR ¶ 1.r, for $61) While SOR ¶ 1.r names the collection agency involved,
neither debt identifies the medical creditor allegedly involved. (Tr. 62-63)
Applicant  earns  about  $21  an  hour,  about  $840  a  week,  not  including  overtime.
(AE  H)  His  pay  is  sometimes  sporadic,  and  he  has  little  to  no  savings.  He  has  some
money  in  his  company  401k  account.  (Tr.  64-66)  His  wife  works for  a  local  community
college and is also a student there. (Tr. 68)
Applicant pays $694 in monthly child support for his two older children ($438 and
$256). His younger two children live with him. (Tr. 66-67) He and his wife own two luxury
cars, both used. They pay $595 and $494 a month on each. They bought one of those
cars  in  April  2019,  for  about  $25,000.  He  said  that  the  garnishments  for  his  tax  debts
impacted his income, and, thus, his ability to pay his other debts. (Tr. 68-69)
Applicant  attested  that  he  intends  to  pay  his  debts.  He  has  not  pursued  credit
counseling. He has not altered his spending to get his debts under better control. (Tr. 70)
If he is given an opportunity to travel to work locations that offer better pay, he will be in a
better position to address his debts. (Tr. 78)
Guideline E
Under  Guideline  E,  the  Government  alleges  that,  when  Applicant  prepared  and
submitted  his  February  2018  E-QIP  application,  he  deliberately  failed  to  disclose  two
prior arrests, in March 2010 and July 2011, both for carrying a pistol without a permit, in
answer  to  a  question  about  his  police  record:  “Have  you  EVER  been  charged  with  an
offense involving firearms or explosives.” (SOR ¶ 2.a) (GE 1) Applicant acknowledged an
omission by stating “I agree” but said he misunderstood the question. (Answer)
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  only  arrested  on  one  occasion.  He  was  arrested
and charged with eluding the police and carrying a pistol without a permit. He believes it
was  in  2011.  He  acknowledged  being  stopped  by  the  police.  He  had  a  weapon,  but  it
was in his car. He did not have the permit on him. When the police stopped his car, he
got  out  and  ran.  Applicant  said  he  went  to  court  and  pleaded  guilty  to  both  counts.  He
received a year of probation. (Tr. 25, 70-73, 80-81)
Applicant’s FBI criminal record and his criminal record in State 1, both part of the
Government’s  case,  suggest  that he  was  arrested  in  March 2010 for eluding  the  police
and for carrying a pistol without a permit; and that he was also arrested, on the same two
charges, in July 2011. (GE 4, GE 5) However, police records Applicant submitted post-
hearing support his testimony that he was  arrested only once on a gun charge (and for
eluding police), in March 2010. (AE F, AE G)
Applicant  stated  his  wife  prepared  his  e-QIP  for  him  because  he  has  reading
problems. He has never been formally diagnosed with a reading or learning disability, but
he  said  he  had  problems  in  school.  He  said  he  and  his  wife  went  through  the  e-QIP
questions together and she consulted him during the process. He said he told her about
the  pistol  charge  and  she  did  not  “put  that  on  there”  because  she  forgot.  He
acknowledged responsibility for reporting information on the e-QIP. He denied any intent
to falsify or to deliberately deceive the Government in failing to disclose any gun charges
on his e-QIP. (Tr. 20-23, 74-79)
Under questioning, Applicant also acknowledged that the handwritten answers to
each allegation in the SOR were written by his wife. He said she read him the SOR and
wrote  down  his  answer  to  each  allegation.  He  said  that  it  is  his  handwriting  on  the
notarized page of his SOR response that contains his signature, address and request for
a hearing. (Tr. 76-78)
As  to  the  criminal  charges  themselves,  Applicant  said  he  was  “young  and  wild
back then” and “being stupid.” He has matured and is a family man. He enjoys spending
time with his children. (Tr. 89-90)
