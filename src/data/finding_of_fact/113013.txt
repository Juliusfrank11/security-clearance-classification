2003. She was married to a U.S. citizen in 2004 and became a U.S. citizen in 2014. She
has no children. She filed for divorce in 2017, the status of which was not specified in
the  record.  She earned  an  associate  degree  in 2010 and  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2014

Guideline B
Applicant’s  mother  (age  59)  and  father  (age  69)  are  Kenyan  citizens  and
residents  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b).  They  reside  in  Nairobi,  the  capital  and  largest  city  of
Kenya.  Her  father  is  a  retired  journalist  with  former  affiliations  with  the  Kenyan
parliament  and  magistrate  courts.  Her  mother  runs  a  non-government  organization
(NGO).  Without  specifying  which  entities  fund  the  NGO,  Applicant  claimed  that  her
mother  is  not  affiliated  with  any  foreign  government.  She  communicates  with  each  of
her parents weekly. (Item 3 at 25-28; Item 7 at 4)
Applicant has four siblings. Sister 1 (age 34) and Brother 1 (age 31) are Kenyan
citizens and residents (SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d). They also reside in Nairobi. Sister 2 (age
31) and Brother 2 (age 27) are Kenyan citizens residing in the United States. Sister 1 is
a  legal  counsel  in  the  office  of  the  Attorney  General  of  Kenya.  Her  other  siblings  are
students. She communicates with Sister 1 and Brother 1 monthly. (Item 3 at 28-33; Item
7 at 4-5, 11)
Applicant  has  close  and  continuing  contact  with  three  friends  who  are  Kenyan
citizens  and  residents.  (SOR  ¶  1.e).  The  record  did  not  specify  in  which  city  these
friends reside. Friend 1 is employed as a manager by a British multinational investment
bank and financial services company. Friend 2 is a member of the clergy at a church in
Nairobi. Neither Friend 3’s employment status nor job title was specified in the record.
She communicates with her friends monthly. (Item 3 at 36-37, 41-42; Item 7 at 6-8)
Applicant travelled to visit family and friends in Kenya in 2011, 2012, and 2017.
She  reported  “in  person”  communications  with  her  parents,  Sister  1,  Brother  1,  and
Friend 1 but did not specify whether they occurred outside of Kenya. Her one in-person
visit with Friend 3 occurred in the United States in 2016. (Item 3 at 9, 25-31, 36-37, 47-
48; Item 7 at 8)
Applicant has owned a home in the United States since 2010. She is now renting
a home in another state, while Sister 2 and Brother 2 reside there.  The record did not
specify what, if  any, equity Applicant has in the home, or  whether she owns  any other
U.S. assets. She co-owns with her mother a dormant bank account, with a $0 balance,
in Kenya. She does not maintain any other foreign financial interests. (Item 3 at 10, 43-
44; Item 7 at 3, 10-11)
Applicant sent approximately $500 per month to her mother over an unspecified
number  of  years  for  her  financial  support  and  to  assist  in  paying  school  fees  for  her
siblings.  As  of  2017,  she  sent  a  total  amount  of  approximately  $10,000.  It  was
unspecified  in  the  record  whether,  in  what  amount,  and  for  how  long  she  intended  to
continue sending money to her mother. (Item 3 at 44-45; Item 7 at 11)
Guideline F
Applicant  has  nine  unresolved  delinquent  debts  totaling  approximately  $32,010
(SOR  ¶¶ 2.a  through 2.i).  She  denied all  but  one of  them  in  her  SOR  answer, without
explanation.  Applicant  claimed  that  her one admitted debt  (SOR  ¶  2.c/$461) would  be
settled by April 2019, without providing any documentary proof. While one debt (SOR ¶
2.g/$3,003) showed a $0 balance on her January 2019 credit report, it was not reported
therein as paid. (Item 5 and 6)
Applicant stated, without further explanation, that she fell behind on payments to
certain  creditors  during  an  unspecified  period  due  to  being  “overwhelmed  with  debt.”
She  also  stated  that  during  her last two  years of  college,  she fell  behind  on her home
mortgage payment and it went into collections. That mortgage is now in good standing
and  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  In  November  2018,  Applicant  described  her  overall
financial situation as “okay” and averred that she was meeting her financial obligations
on time “for the most part.” (AE A; Item 7 at 11-12)
Administrative Notice (Kenya)
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  the  U.S.  Government’s  pronouncements
concerning Kenya, as outlined in its Request for Administrative Notice (Item 4) and the
documents appended thereto, including the following:
  Kenya  is  a  republic  with  three  branches  of  government:  an
executive  branch,  led  by  a  directly  elected  president;  a  bicameral
parliament  consisting  of  the  Senate  and  the  National  Assembly;
and a judiciary. (Item 4: Item I at 1)
  There  is  considerable  risk  from  terrorism  in  Nairobi.  Terrorism
remains a high priority concern. The U.S. government continues to
receive  information  regarding  potential  terrorist  threats  aimed  at
U.S.,  Western,  and  Kenyan  interests  in  the  Nairobi  area,  counties
bordering  Somalia,  and  in  the  coastal  areas  including  Mombasa
and Malindi. (HE I at 2)
  Kenya  is  a  strong  U.S.  partner  in  counterterrorism  investigation,
prosecution,  and  incident  response,  and  continued  to  play  an
important  role  in  regional  counterterrorism  cooperation.  Reports  of
human  rights  violations  by  security  forces  during  counterterrorism
operations  continued, including  allegations  of  extra-judicial killings,
disappearances,  and  torture.  Coordination  among  the  Kenyan
governmental  agencies  with  counterterrorism
functions  was
uneven,  with  improved  information  sharing  in  some  cases  and
failure  to  appropriately  pass  threat  information  in  others.  Overall,
resource  constraints,  insufficient  training,  corruption,  and  unclear
command  and  control  hindered  effectiveness.  (Item  4:  Item  IV  at
24-25, 26)
in
  Despite  public  progress
fighting  corruption,
the  Kenyan
government  does  not  implement  relevant  laws  effectively,  and
officials  frequently  engaged  in  alleged  corrupt  practices  with
impunity. Bribery is the most commonly reported type of corruption.
Police  corruption  remains  a  significant  problem.  (Item  4:  Item  I  at
29-30)
  Human rights issues with the Kenyan government include: unlawful
and  politically  motivated  killings;  forced  disappearances;  torture;
harsh  and  life-threatening  prison  conditions;  arbitrary  arrest  and
detention;  an  inefficient  judiciary;  arbitrary  infringement  of  citizens’
privacy  rights;  censorship;  lack  of  accountability  in  many  cases
involving  violence  against  women,  including  rape  and  female
genital  mutilation/cutting;  and  criminalization  of  same-sex  sexual
conduct. (Item 4: Item I at 1)
I  sua  sponte  admitted  to  the  record,  as  HE  I,  the  following  updated  source
document  cited  in  Item  4:  Item  III,  updated  March  14,  2019.  The  updated  website
address  is  https://www.osac.gov/Country/Kenya/Content/Detail/Report/03c822af-2922-
4a4c-ba8b-15f4aead1599 (note that this document was available at the time Item 4 was
submitted  in  June  2019).  I  also  sua  sponte  amended  page  5  of  Item  4  to  correct  a
typographical  error  in  the  list  of  source  documents,  thereby  changing  the  date  from
March 29, 2018 to April 9, 2019. Because these sua sponte actions did not affect either
the  relative  positions  of  the  parties  or  my  decision,  prior  notice  to  the  parties  was  not
required.
