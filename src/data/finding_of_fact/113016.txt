In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c,
1.e-1.h, and 2.c. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d, 1.i-1.l, 2.a, 2.b, and 2.d.
His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  43-year-old  senior  systems  administrator  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since March 2017. He has held a security clearance since September 1996.
Applicant married in May 2004 and separated in 2017. (Tr. 19.) He and his wife
have two children, ages 13 and 19, who live with Applicant. (Tr. 56.)
Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  from  February  1996  to
December 1999. In December 1997, he received nonjudicial punishment for unauthorized
absence  and  making  a  false  official  statement.  He  received  a  suspended  reduction  in
rank, forfeiture of $50 pay, and 15 days of extra duty. (GX 12 at 7.) In late 1998, he was
convicted by a general court-martial of wrongful use of cocaine. He was reduced to the
lowest  enlisted  rank,  restricted to the  limits of  his  duty  station,  and  ordered  to  perform
hard  labor  without  confinement  for  45  days.  (GX  12  at  4.)  In  June  1999,  he  was
administratively  discharged  for  misconduct  and  received  a  general  discharge  under
honorable conditions. (GX 12 at 2.)
The record does not reflect Applicant’s employment history from June 1999 to July
2007. He worked for non-government employers from August 2007 to September 2013.
He worked for another defense contractor from September 2013 to March 2016, and was
terminated for chronic tardiness. In his SCA, he stated that he left this employer because
his contract ended. At the hearing, he admitted that he knew he had been fired, and he
admitted that he falsified his SCA when he stated that he left this job because his contract
ended. (Tr. 35.)
Applicant worked for another defense contractor from April to November 2016, and
he was fired for submitting a fraudulent information technology (IT) certification. (GX 2;
GX 11) He denied that he submitted a fraudulent certificate, and explained that he simply
submitted  his  previous  expired  certification.  (Tr.  21-23.)  He  was  unemployed  from
November 2016 until he was hired for his current job. (GX 1 at 10.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  had  three  surgeries  for  herniated  disks  in  his  back
between 2003 and 2012, and he was prescribed opiate medications following his surgery.
He believed that he became addicted to opiates, but he was unable to obtain professional
help in overcoming his addiction, because he was using the opiates in accordance with
his  prescriptions.  He  stopped  taking  the  medications  in  2017,  because  they  adversely
affected his work, his financial situation, and his marriage. (Tr. 23-31.) He provided no
documentation to support his testimony.
The SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts reflected in credit reports from June 2019,
January 2019, November 2017, and June 2016 (GX 3-6), and various court records (GX
7-10). The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: judgment for $1,805, filed in 2014. Applicant testified that he was
unaware of this judgment when he submitted his SCA, and he had not made any recent
efforts to identify it. (Tr. 35-36; GX 7.) It is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b: judgment for $1,884, filed in 2015. Applicant testified that he believes
this  judgment  is  for  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.f  and  that  the  original  creditor  was  a
dentist. (Tr. 37; GX 8.)
SOR ¶ 1.c: judgment for $961, filed in 2017 and satisfied by garnishment. This
debt  was  for  homeowners’  association  dues,  and  it  was  satisfied  by  garnishment  of
Applicant’s bank account in June 2018. (GX 9.) It was incurred because Applicant and
his wife each thought that the other was paying it. (Tr. 39.)
SOR  ¶  1.d:  home-mortgage  loan  past  due  for  $3,030,  with  a  balance  of
$223,668. Applicant testified that this loan became delinquent because he and his wife
were separated, and each believed that the other was making the payments. (Tr. 14) He
fell behind in April 2016. He contacted the lender and applied for hardship assistance,
which was granted, and his monthly payments were reduced. (GX 13 at 5.) He testified
that he has been making regular payments and the account is current. (Tr. 42.) The June
2019 credit report reflects that the payments were current when the debt was transferred
to another lender in April 2019. (GX 3 at 3.)
SOR ¶ 1.e: medical debt placed for collection of $2,223. This debt was placed
for collection in July 2017. (GX 4 at 2.) The creditor obtained a judgment against Applicant
for this debt in March 2019. (GX 10.) Applicant paid it in full on August 29, 2019. (AX A.)
SOR ¶ 1.f: charge account placed for collection of $2,298. On September 14,
2018, Applicant made a payment agreement providing for monthly $50 payments. As of
September 3, 2019, his balance due on this debt was $1,698. Although Applicant testified
that he thought this debt might be a dental bill, his documentation reflects that the original
creditor is a discount department store. (GX 3 at 1; AX C.)
SOR ¶ 1.g: medical debt placed for collection of $543. Applicant paid this debt
in full on August 30, 2019. (AX B.)
SOR  ¶¶  1.h  and  1.i:  medical  debts  placed  for  collection  of  $190  and $166.
Applicant paid these debts in full on September 13, 2019. (AX D.)
SOR ¶ 1.j: credit-card account charged off for $3,859 in July 2013. This debt
is not being resolved. Applicant testified that he was making monthly $50 payments on
this debt, but his documentation of the monthly payments reflects that the payments were
for the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f. (Tr. 47.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.l: collection accounts for $638 and $489. Applicant testified
that both collection accounts were for medical bills and that they have been paid in full.
(Tr. 48.) He did not provide any documentation supporting his testimony.
When Applicant submitted his SCA in April 2017, he answered “No” to a question,
“Have  you  EVER  been  charged  with  an  offense  involving  alcohol  or  drugs?”  (Capital
letters were used for emphasis in the SCA.) He did not disclose that he was charged with
wrongful use of cocaine and convicted by a court-martial in 1998. (GX 1 at 26.) When he
was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator in  August  2017,  he  voluntarily  disclosed  his
nonjudicial punishment, but he did not disclose his court-martial conviction until he was
confronted  with  the  evidence.    He  told  the  investigator  that  he  did  not  disclose  the
conviction  in  his  SCA  because  it  was  embarrassing.  (GX  13  at  8.)  At  the  hearing,  he
testified  that  he  did  not  disclose  the  conviction  because  he  did  not  understand  the
question in the SCA. (Tr. 15.)
Applicant  also  answered  “No”  to  the  question  in  the  SCA  asking  if  he  had  any
judgments entered against him in the last seven years. (GX 1 at 30.) He testified that he
was unaware of the judgments alleged in the SOR when he submitted his SCA. (Tr. 33.)
He  became  aware  of  the  judgment  for  homeowners’  association  dues  when  his  bank
account was garnished in June 2018 to satisfy the judgment. (Tr. 39-40.)
Applicant  also  answered  “No”  to  the  questions  in  the  SCA  about  delinquencies
involving routine accounts during the last seven years. (GX 1 at 30.) When asked why he
did not disclose any of his delinquent debts, he responded, “I don’t really have an answer
for that.” (Tr. 34.) His answer to this question in the SCA is not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant currently earns $102,000 per year. (Tr. 20.) He has about $8,000 in a
savings account and about $28,000 in retirement accounts. (Tr. 53-54.) He hired a law
firm  to  dispute  some  of  his  debts,  but  he  has  never  sought  or  obtained  financial
counseling. (Tr. 51.)
