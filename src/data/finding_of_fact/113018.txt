Applicant is 54 years old. He has been married to his wife for over 27 years, and
they have two children, ages 24 and 20. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2015. He has
worked  for  a  state  university  (SU)  as  a  network  engineer  since  2001,  and  he  has
continuously held a security clearance in this position. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 10-12, 15)
In  2004,  just  before  the  housing-market  bubble  burst,  Applicant  purchased  two
townhomes  as  investment  properties.  They  each  cost  less  than  $90,000.  After  he
purchased the properties, the townhome complex became flooded with other investors,
and the community deteriorated. As the neighborhood went downhill, it became more and
more difficult for him to rent the properties. The renters he was able to find paid late, failed
to pay, and damaged the properties. Additionally, the rent he collected was less than his
monthly  mortgage  payments. Within  a few  years,  the  community  pool,  clubhouse,  and
tennis courts were closed due to a lack of sufficient homeowners’ association dues and
essential maintenance. Applicant was unable to sell or short-sell the properties. (Answer;
GE 1 at 37-39; GE 2 at 5-6; Tr. 16-17, 25-29, 32-35)
Eventually, it became unsustainable for Applicant to maintain the properties and
pay the mortgages. He stopped making the monthly mortgage payments in March 2011,
and the properties were repossessed by the creditors in July and September 2011. (GE
2 at 5-6; Tr. 16-17, 25-29, 35)
In addition to the debt associated with the investment properties, Applicant and his
wife had other unalleged financial issues related to her former business, which operated
from 2006 to 2008. The business had a negative impact on their finances as she used
their  personal  credit  to  support  the  business.  This  business  began  failing  at  about  the
same time that Applicant and his wife struggled to make payments for their investment
properties. The debts associated with the former business have been resolved. (Tr. 39-
41)
In  2011,  Applicant  received  an  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  Form  1099-C,
Cancellation of Debt and an IRS Form 1099-A, Acquisition or Abandonment of Secured
Property for the respective investment properties. The 1099-C cancelled an $18,152 debt
for  Property  A.  The  1099-A  showed  that  Applicant’s  mortgage  for  Property  B  was
$84,000, and the townhome was worth less than $66,000. Applicant filed his 2011 state
and  Federal  income  tax  returns  in  March  2013.  He  then  entered  into  a  payment
arrangement  with  the  IRS  to  resolve  the  tax  obligations  for  both  properties.  Applicant
made  $350  monthly  payments  for  three  years  and  resolved  the  $13,000  tax  debt.  In
January 2015, he entered into an installment agreement with the IRS for tax years 2012
and 2013. The 2011 tax debt delayed his ability to pay his taxes for subsequent tax years.
His tax documents show these tax years have been resolved. (Answer; AE B; AE L; AE
M; AE O; AE R; Tr. 29, 36-37)
In 2014, Applicant’s mislaid his tax documents. Through his tax preparer, he filed
for  extensions  for  tax  years  2014  and  2015,  but  did  not  file  the  returns  when  the
extensions  expired.  The  tax  issues  “cascaded”  in  conjunction  with  the  family-related
problems mentioned above, as a result he failed to file his 2015 through 2017 income tax
returns. He never intended not to pay his taxes, and always recognized that he had an
obligation to file his income tax returns and pay his income taxes. Applicant testified that
he should have been more diligent in addressing his outstanding income taxes. (Answer;
GE 1 at 36; GE 2 at 4, 6-7; Tr. 25, 30-31, 43-45, 49-50)
In 2014, Applicant’s mother-in-law moved in with his family due to suffering from
metastatic breast cancer. She passed away in their home in October 2015. In addition to
providing support for their then minor children, Applicant and his wife also provided some
financial support to her late mother. Applicant’s wife was diagnosed with breast cancer in
2016,  and  had  a  double  mastectomy  in  June  2016.  The  same  weekend  of  his  wife’s
surgery, their youngest son’s best friend killed himself. In October 2016, Applicant’s wife’s
grandmother  passed  away  as  well.  All  of  these  family  issues  were  overwhelming  to
Applicant and his family and contributed to his failure to address his tax obligations in a
timely manner. (Answer; Tr. 37, 39-40, 46-47, 50-53, 71)
In October 2018, Applicant received DOD financial interrogatories. As a result of
receiving  the  interrogatories,  Applicant  looked  for  the  missing  2014  documents  and
ultimately found them in storage unit he had rented for his brother-in-law. In response to
the  interrogatories,  his  accountant  helped  him  complete  the  2014  to  2017  state  and
federal income tax returns, and Applicant mailed them to the appropriate authorities on
December 4, 2018. (Answer; GE 3; Tr. 31, 43, 45, 49-50, 54-60)
In  March  2019,  Applicant,  with  the  assistance  of  his  accountant,  entered  into  a
payment agreement with the IRS. In May 2019, Applicant made a lump-sum payment of
$9,941.17 to the IRS, which resolved tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017. He then entered
into a modified agreement with the IRS to make monthly payments of $200 to resolve the
$11,211 balance for tax year 2014. (AE B; AE C; AE D; AE N; Tr. 22-24, 60-61)
Applicant’s accountant filed for an extension for tax year 2018 in a timely manner.
After the hearing, Applicant provided proof that his 2018 state and Federal income tax
returns were filed and paid. He intends to resolve his outstanding IRS tax debt as soon
as possible. Applicant’s state taxes are current and paid. He has no outstanding obligation
for any state tax year. Applicant credibly testified that he will never fail to file his income
tax  returns  again.  Applicant  provided  an  updated  credit  report  and  copies  of  his  most
recent utility bills. He pays his bills in a timely manner and has no new delinquent debts.
(AE A; AE E; AE F; AE H; AE I; AE K; AE P; AE Q; Tr. 40, 61-65, 72-73, 75)
Applicant  and his wife  have  not  attended  credit  counseling, but they  have  been
working with their accountant to resolve their tax issues. Collectively, Applicant and his
wife collectively earn between $159,000 and $169,000 annually. They have $24,000 in
savings  and  checking  accounts,  and  their  retirement  accounts  total  $420,000.  They
purchased their home in 2001 and paid off the mortgage in March 2018, and he drives a
12-year-old car. Applicant does not live beyond his means. They have the financial means
to make the IRS payments and intend to resolve this debt as soon as possible. (AE I; Tr.
16, 67-70, 74-76)
Applicant submitted a 2018 performance evaluation, in which he is described as a
team  player,  customer-focused,  and  diligent.  His  supervisor  described  his  work  as
exemplary  and  stated  that  Applicant  responded  to  an  increased  workload  with
enthusiasm.  Additionally,  he  found  Applicant’s  “long  term  perspective  .  .  .  is  very
grounding….  His  technical  acumen,  always  calm  presence,  an  insights  make  him  a
valuable member of the . . . team.” (AE G)
