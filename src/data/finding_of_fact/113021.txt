is as follows:
(1.a) Applicant has not filed Federal income tax  returns for 2011 and 2012. She
said she had been unable to obtain the necessary documents that were in a storage unit
she lost because she was unable to pay storage fees in 2013. She said she was working
on the issue with an accountant. She submitted a document from the Internal Revenue

she has been unable to obtain the necessary documents that were in a storage unit she
