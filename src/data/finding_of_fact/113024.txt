In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations, explaining that
some of the debts had been satisfied or were being satisfied. His admissions in his answer
and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 50-year-old logistics auditor employed by a defense contractor since
April 2017. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from October 1987 to June 2014
and retired as a chief petty officer. He was unemployed from June 2014 to April 2015. He
worked  for  a  ride-sharing  company  from  April  2015  until  he  was  hired  by  his  current
employer. (GX 2 at 3.) He held a security clearance while he was on active duty in the
Navy. (Tr. 27.)
Applicant  married  in  March  1992  and  he  has  two  children.  He  obtained  an
associate’s degree in 2010, a bachelor’s degree in 2011, and a master’s degree in 2012.
The  SOR  alleges  32  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $80,000.  The  debts  are
reflected in three credit reports and court records reflecting judgments entered against
Applicant. (GX 3-6.) Applicant disclosed three delinquent debts, including the debt alleged
in SOR ¶ 1.l, when he submitted his SCA, and he declared his intention to “schedule new
monthly payments on all [his] credit cards to have them all paid off in 2018.” (GX 1 at 30-
34.) When he was interviewed by a security investigator in April 2018, he was confronted
with numerous delinquent debts. He claimed to be resolving several of them but provided
no documentation of his claims. (GX 2 at 5-9.) The evidence concerning the debts and
judgments alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
