I have incorporated Applicant’s admissions in his SOR response in the findings of
fact.  Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  GE  1,  his  security  clearance
application,  dated  September  9,  2017,  (SCA)  unless  otherwise  indicated  by  a
parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings
and the record evidence, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant, 49, works for a U.S. Government contractor as a program management
principle. He has been employed by his security clearance sponsor since 2008, when he
earned a bachelor’s degree. He also entered into a master’s program in 2011 and earned
his degree in 2015. He has held a security clearance since 2008. The DOD CAF’s action
was based upon Applicant’s financial problems arising out of his divorce and related child-
custody issues.
Applicant was married in 2004. He and his wife have two children, and she has a
child from a prior relationship. Applicant’s wife filed for divorce in 2011. The divorce was
finalized in 2013. After the divorce, Applicant fathered a child with another woman.
Applicant had joint custody of their children with his ex-wife until 2016. He filed for
full custody of the children due to the behavior of his ex-wife. This began a lengthy court
battle  that  Applicant  eventually  lost.  In  December 2016,  his ex-wife  was  awarded  sole
legal  custody  of  their  two  children  and  his  rights  were  limited  to  visitation  every  other
weekend. His child support payments increased from $300 to $2,200 per month, which
caused him financial hardship. He also incurred significant legal expenses and other costs
related to the custody dispute. After he lost his joint custodial rights, he was ordered by
the court to pay his wife’s legal expenses. The dispute with his ex-wife is ongoing three
years later.
On four or more occasions, the civil divorce court found Applicant to be in contempt
of its orders. The court also ordered Applicant to be jailed for two days for contempt. The
order  regarding  contempt  states  that  this  penalty  was  imposed  due  to  Applicant’s
submission of false income information and documentation, but Applicant insists he was
only jailed because he could not afford to pay the court-ordered legal fees. (Tr. 27-29, 39-
40, 42, 44, 46, 81-82.; GE 5 at 1, 12; AE B at 32, 34-44, 45, 48-51, 54)
Applicant  borrowed  significant  amounts  of  money  to  pay  the  expenses  of  his
unsuccessful  attempt  to  gain  full  custody  of  his  children,  even  though  he  was  making
about $120,000 per year, and with a second job in 2017, he made an additional $40,000
in that year. This custody dispute occurred while he was also paying for graduate school
with borrowed funds. At the same time that he was incurring these new debts, he also
retained his home on which he had a mortgage in excess of $400,000. He testified that
he did not want to sell his home because he wanted it for his children. He defaulted on
both  the  first  and  second  mortgages,  and  the  lender  sued  for  foreclosure.  He  also
defaulted on a number of loans that he used to finance his expenses related to his custody
dispute.  In  May  2019,  Applicant  sold  his  house  and  paid  off  his  first  mortgage  and  a
second mortgage of about $40,000 with the sales proceeds. (Tr. 25, 38-39; GE 7 at 3;
GE 4; AE C at 9-10.)
Applicant tried to work with a debt-consolidation company in  2015 and 2016. At
that  time,  he  stopped  paying  his  bills,  assuming  they  would  be  paid  by  the  debt
consolidator.  The  company  negotiated  a  settlement  of  one  of  his  debts,  but  Applicant
learned that the company was paying itself substantial fees leaving insufficient monies to
fund the settlement. He ceased paying the company in 2016. After being ordered to pay
his wife’s legal fees in late 2017, he opted for what he referred to at the hearing as a new
“mitigation  strategy.”  In  January  2018, he filed a bankruptcy  petition under Chapter 13
(SOR ¶ 1.a), but two of his creditors, his ex-wife and her attorney objected. For reasons
that  Applicant  could  not  clearly  explain,  that  stopped  the  proceeding,  and  it  was
administratively dismissed when he did not pursue the case. (Tr. 28-35, 57; AE G; AE H.)
In July 2018, Applicant refiled under Chapter 13 with the same result. (SOR ¶ 1.b)
He submitted after the hearing evidence that he had filed a new bankruptcy petition on
August  7,  2019,  this  time  under  Chapter  7  seeking  a  full  discharge  of  his  debts.  He
testified at the hearing that he was contemplating taking this step, but he could not explain
why such a petition would not face the same obstacles that halted his prior two petitions.
He also testified that in filing for bankruptcy relief, he was not intending to alter his court-
ordered obligations to pay his ex-wife and her attorney, but he could not explain why they
sought to prevent him from pursuing his bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 28-30, 32-33, 36, 41-43;
AE F.)
The 19 delinquent debts alleged in the SOR total more than $700,000, the largest
of which was his mortgage and second mortgage. Applicant submitted no documentary
evidence listing the debts covered by his latest bankruptcy petition. (SOR response; AE
F.)
In his SOR response, Applicant admitted the following six delinquent debts, which
total about $100,000:
SOR  ¶  1.c:  Debt  owed  to  lender  placed  for  collection  in  the  amount  of
$13,509. Applicant borrowed  $15,000 from  this lender in  January  2016  to pay  his bills
during  the  period  of  his  financial  distress  caused  by  his  2013  divorce  and  subsequent
child-custody dispute. He defaulted on the loan in about January 2017 due to the ongoing
costs  associated  with  his lengthy  divorce  proceeding.  Aside from  his attempts  to  seek
relief from this debt under Chapter 13, he has done nothing to pay the debt. The same is
true with respect to the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f, discussed below. (GE 2 at
8-9; Tr. 49-51.)
SOR  ¶  1.e:  Debt  owed  to  a  lender  charged  off  in  the  amount  of  $32,143.
Applicant borrowed $35,000 from this lender in February 2015 to pay his bills during a
period of financial distress caused by his divorce. He defaulted on the loan in about June
2016. He has not resolved this debt, but following discussions with the creditor, he has
learned that he must initially pay $115 per month for a period to qualify for a settlement
to resolve the debt. He has not made any payments. (Tr. 50; GE 2 at 6; AE I.)
SOR  ¶  1.f:  Debt  owed  to  a  lender  charged  off  in  the  amount  of  $27,105.
Applicant borrowed $30,000 from this lender in July 2015 and defaulted in May 2016. (Tr.
50; GE 2 at 6-7; AE J.)
SOR ¶ 1.j: Debt owed to computer manufacturer placed for collection in the
amount  of  $1,443.  Applicant  purchased  computer  equipment  on  credit  in  2015  and
defaulted in July 2016. (Tr. 56-57; GE 2 at 9; GE 7 at 4.)
SOR  ¶  1.l:  Debt  owed  to  a  lender  placed  for  collection  in  the  amount  of
$15,473. Applicant did not disclose this debt in his SCA, and it was not discussed in his
February  2018  background  interview.  He  listed  the  debt  in  his  July  2018  Chapter  13
bankruptcy petition. He testified that this debt is one of his student loans, which he paid
for a period and then stopped paying. (Tr. 59-62; SOR response; GE 4 at 37.)
SOR  ¶  1.m:  Debt  owed  to  a  credit  union  on  a  credit-card  account  in  the
amount  of  $25,886.  Applicant  did  not  disclose  this  debt  in  his  SCA,  and  it  was  not
discussed in his February 2018 background interview. He listed the debt in his July 2018
Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition.  He testified that he has contacted the credit union but
has  not  agreed  to  a  payment  plan  nor  has  he  made  any  payments.  (Tr.  62-64;  SOR
response; GE 4 at 37.)
In his SOR response, Applicant admitted five debts and one other allegation “in
part.” These matters are:
SOR  ¶¶  1.g  and 1.h: Two  credit-card  accounts  placed  for  collection  in  the
amounts of $20,945 and $11,072, respectively. In both cases, the credit-card issuers
sued  Applicant  and  obtained  judgments,  which  were  enforced  for  a  period  by  way  of
garnishment. Applicant testified that the garnishments ceased at some point, though he
acknowledged  that  much  of  the  debts  remain  unpaid.  He  could  not  explain  why  the
garnishments  ceased,  but  it  is  likely  the  result  of  Applicant’s  bankruptcy  filings.  These
debts remain unpaid, though the amounts due may have been somewhat reduced unless
interest and collection expenses actually increased the amounts of the debts. (Tr. 51-52.)
SOR  ¶¶  1.o  and  1.p:  First  and  second  mortgage  accounts  listed  in
Applicant’s  July  2018  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  petition.  Applicant  and  his  ex-wife
bought  a  residence  in  April  2009.  In  connection  with  his  separation  and  divorce,  he
refinanced the mortgage loan in the amount of $407,500. He also borrowed or had a line
of credit in the amount of $50,000 from the same lender that was secured by a second
mortgage.  He  defaulted  on  both  loans  in  late  2017.  The  lender  instituted  mortgage
foreclosure proceedings. He hoped that his Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings in 2018 would
halt the foreclosure on his home or give him the opportunity to renegotiate the repayment
terms of the loans. Before the foreclosure was completed, Applicant sold the home in May
2019,  and  the  proceeds  were  sufficient  to  satisfy  both  loans.  Applicant  introduced  a
document  from  the  lender  evidencing  that  the  first  mortgage  was  paid  in  full.  He  also
provided a current credit report that reflected that the second mortgage was also satisfied.
(Tr. 65-68, 93; AE D at 1, 3, 17-19; GE 2 at 10.)
SOR ¶ 1.q: Debt owed to Applicant’s ex-wife in the amount of $19,762. In his
SOR response, Applicant admitted that he owes this debt, which is for his ex-wife’s legal
fees, plus interest on the debt. The civil court had ordered that the debt be paid through
a wage garnishment in monthly installments of $1,000. This payment is in addition to the
wage  garnishment  for  his  ongoing  child  support  payments,  plus  $500  per  month  for
sanctions.  He  testified  that  the  debt  was  not  actually  for  a  delinquency.  The  debt
represents  monies  accruing  during  the  interval  between  when  his  ex-wife  requested
increased child support payments and when the court actually awarded her the increase.
Applicant claims this debt is now about $16,000, plus interest, but he failed to provide any
documentation reflecting the remaining balance. (Tr. 44-45, 47-48, 68-69; AE B at 45-47,
53-54.)
SOR  ¶  1.u:  Court  ruling  holding  Applicant  in  contempt  for  failure  to  make
required  payments  and  ordering  him  to  serve  two  days  in  jail  with  a  60-day
suspended  sentence.  Following  hearings  in  February  and  April  2018,  the  civil  court
found that Applicant had failed to make required payments and had been deceptive in his
discovery responses and testimony and had “fabricated tax returns.” Applicant conceded
at  the hearing  that  he  was  found  in  contempt  and  ordered  to be  jailed for two  days  in
2018, but he insisted that the contempt was solely due to his inability to pay the legal fees
of his ex-wife, as required by the court’s order. In making this argument, he admitted that
he had failed to make the required payments. (Tr. 76-84; GE 5; AE B.)
In his SOR response, Applicant denied the following six remaining debts:
Applicant claimed to have paid only one of these debts, and the amount of the debt
was  $133.  (SOR  ¶  1.n.)  He  provided  no  documentary  evidence  of  the  payment.  He
asserted  that  he  paid  off  a  car  loan  with  a  voluntary  repossession,  again  without  any
documentary evidence that there was no deficiency debt claimed by the lender. (SOR ¶
1.t.) He claimed that a loan was repaid as part of his debt-consolidation effort, though he
testified that this debt was not resolved because the consolidation company paid itself a
fee  and  the  lender  would  not  accept  the  reduced  amount  of  the  previously  negotiated
settlement amount. (SOR ¶ 1.i.) In his SOR response, he denied the three other debts
claiming he was unaware of them and had never heard of the alleged creditor. (SOR ¶¶
1.k, 1.r, 1.s.) In his background interview, he admitted that he was aware of the unpaid
medical bill alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k. He also admitted at the hearing that he had made no
inquiry into the two largest alleged debts for $29,142  (SOR ¶ 1.r) and $32,143 (SOR ¶
1.s)  and  creditors,  although  they  were  listed  in  his  July  2018  bankruptcy  petition.  He
believes they may be duplicates of the debts alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f and ¶ 1.e, respectively,
but he cannot say for sure since he has not investigated either debt. (Tr. 37, 52-54, 59,
64, 70-72, 74-76; GE 2 at 7; GE 4 at 33, 39.)
Applicant testified that he received financial counseling from the debt-consolidation
company, but it is unclear from the record whether the counseling was from a reliable and
qualified  source.  He  also  provided  evidence  of  having  completed  the  bankruptcy
requirement of counseling as part of one of his Chapter 13 petitions. He may have also
received counseling from his bankruptcy attorney, but there was no evidence as to what
the  attorney  may  have  advised,  and  the  results  of  the  two  petitions  filed  in  2018  raise
questions about the advice and whether Applicant followed it. (Tr. 85-86; AE E.)
The contempt citations issued by the civil divorce court are relevant to the issue of
character. Applicant insists, however, that that his problems with the court were limited to
his inability to pay everything he was required to pay in a timely manner.
