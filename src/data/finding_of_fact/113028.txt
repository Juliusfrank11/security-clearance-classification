In his SOR response, Applicant admitted that he failed to file his 2011-2017 federal
and state taxes as required (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b). I have incorporated his admissions in
my findings of fact. Applicant’s personal information is extracted from GE 1, his security
clearance  application  (SCA),  dated  February  9,  2018,  unless  otherwise  indicated  by  a
parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,
Applicant’s testimony at the hearing, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant, 64, works as a senior engineer for a defense contractor. He has worked
continuously since at least 1995, with two periods of unemployment, one in 2015 and a
second  shorter period  in  2017.  He earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in 1978.  From  1979  to
1994, he held a secret clearance while working for a defense contractor. He has applied
for a clearance in connection with his current position, which he has held since October
2017. He is married and has two adult children.
In his February 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had not filed his federal and
state  income  tax  returns  since  2010.  He  wrote  that  he  believed  that  he  has  adequate
withholding  to  pay  his  tax  liabilities  and  was  “in  the  process  of  gathering  the  required
information  to  file  the  appropriate  tax  forms  and  seeking  the  services  of  a  tax
service/accountant to help catchup.” He blamed his delay on missing paperwork. At that
time, his 2017 tax returns were not yet due. (GE 1 at 34.)
In his April 26, 2018 background interview, Applicant again blamed his delinquency
on missing paperwork. He told the investigator that he planned to hire a CPA by the end
of May 2018 and has a goal of completing all of his returns by July 2018. He said that he
had not dealt with this issue because of “anxiety and time.” He also said that he did not
believe  that  he  owes  any  back  taxes.  In  his  February  28,  2019  response  to  DOHA’s
interrogatories, Applicant disclosed that he has not filed his 2018 federal or state income
tax returns. He also wrote that he was “currently working CPA (sic) and submitting back
tax  forms.  Federal  2011  has  been  filed  and  working  on  2012  and  other  years.”  He
indicated  that  the  2011  tax  returns  were  filed  on  February  28,  2019,  the  date  of  his
response.  At  the  hearing,  he  submitted  a  letter  from  the  IRS  covering  tax  year  2011
showing that he was due a refund of $28,283. (GE 2 at 4, 5, 9; AE A.)
In  his  April  24,  2019  SOR  response,  Applicant  wrote  that  he  and  his  wife  had
difficulty filing returns for his wife’s business. He indicated that he needed those returns
to file his income tax returns. Since 2011, they have not been able “to catch up.” He wrote
that he expects to file his returns within the next two to three months. Applicant received
notice of  his September 25, 2019  hearing  on  September 6,  2019.  He  appeared  at the
hearing without having filed any additional tax returns. As noted, I left the record open for
an additional month to give Applicant the opportunity to take whatever steps he desired
to take. After that month, his response was that he needed an additional 45 days to work
with his tax preparation firm to complete the delinquent tax returns. He commented that
he was “actively working” on the details necessary for the preparation of his tax forms.
Under the circumstances, I declined to grant Applicant’s request closed the record, but I
admitted his email into the record as evidence of the status of his efforts as of the close
of the record. (App. Ex. D at 1-2.)
Applicant  submitted  at  the  hearing  two  photographs  depicting  his tax  records  in
plastic boxes with each year carefully labeled. He testified the tax firm that prepared his
2011 tax returns was the same firm he and his wife used prior to 2010.  He offered no
explanation as to why they did not continue with that tax preparation service in the years
following 2010. He stated further that he would like to have everything filed by the end of
the year and could probably complete his 2012 returns in a week or at least within the
next 30 days. He testified that he felt anxious preparing the documentation needed to fill
out his tax forms. He could not explain why that was  such a problem if he believed he
would receive tax refunds. (AE C; Tr. 8-17, 29.)
Applicant presented information regarding his background and his charitable work.
He is a member of one or more boards  of charitable organizations. He has also spent
significant periods taken caring of his sick, elderly parents before they died. He provided
assurances that in every other part of his life, he follows the rules. (Tr. 21-23, 43.)
