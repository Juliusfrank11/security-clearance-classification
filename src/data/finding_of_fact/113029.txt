Applicant  is  55  years  old.  He  separated  from  his  wife  of  27  years  in  December
2015, and divorced on a date not specified in the record. They have three adult children.
He  honorably  served  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  1983  through  1989.  He  earned  his
bachelor’s  degree  in  1987.  He  was  previously  granted  a  DOD  security  clearance  in
1988.
Applicant  has  been  employed  by  the  same  defense  contractor  since  January
2008, except for a period between March 2015 and July 2016 when he was separated
due to a reduction in force (RIF). He received severance pay of an unspecified amount,
which he used for support during the RIF. Since April 2015, Applicant has also worked
part  time  as  a  self-employed  contractor  (which  after  July  2016  consisted  of  working
remotely outside of his full-time employment hours). (SOR Answer at 3; Item 3 at 12-13;
Item 6 at 7)
The SOR alleged five delinquent credit-card debts totaling $63,736 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a
– 1.e), and that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose any of them on his SCA (SOR ¶
2.a).  Applicant  admitted  each  of  the  alleged  debts,  but  denied  any  deliberate  intent  to
falsify his SCA. Two accounts were charged-off by Creditor 1 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b), and
three by Creditor 2 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c – 1.e).
Applicant  resolved  two  of  the  three  debts  owed  to  Creditor  2  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and
1.e)  in  November  2018.  While  he  proffered  documents  asserting  that  he  resolved  all
three  debts  owed  to  Creditor  2  (AE  B,  C,  F),  the  account  numbers  referenced  therein
did not match those listed on the credit reports. Thus, it was unclear to which SOR debt
each  document  related.  However,  the  Government  conceded  that  the  two  resolved
debts  were  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  ($8,061)  and  1.e  ($7,815),  and  that  SOR  ¶  1.c  remained
unresolved. (FORM at 2-3)
Applicant’s three unresolved debts total $47,860, including SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($24,820
owed to Creditor 1), 1.b ($13,799 owed to Creditor 1), and 1.c ($9,241 owed to Creditor
2). In July 2018, Creditor 2 offered to settle the debt alleged in SOR  ¶ 1.c. The record
did  not  specify  who  wrote  “Paid”  on  the  copy  of  that  offer  (AE  D),  nor  was  any  other
corroborating  documentation  provided.  In  December  2018,  Applicant  finalized  an
agreement with Creditor 1  to repay the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. Under the terms of
that agreement, he was obligated to pay $7,000 via monthly payments of $200 between
December 2019 and October 2021. (AE A). He did not provide proof of any completed
payments.  In  February  2019,  he  was  in  the  process  of  negotiating  a  settlement  with
Creditor  1  for  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a,  the  current  status  of  which  was  not
specified. (AE E).
Applicant  certified  his  “no”  response
financial
delinquencies on his SCA in July 2016. His certification included that “my statements on
this form . . . are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and
are  made  in  good  faith.”  He  was  interviewed  in  August  2017  in  connection  with  his
security-clearance  investigation  to  discuss,  among  other  things,  the  contents  of  his
SCA.
to  whether  he  had  any
Applicant made inconsistent statements about his financial issues throughout his
August 2017 SI. Initially, Applicant stated that he was financially stable and able to pay
his  bills,  and  maintained  that  there  were  no  issues  with  his  finances.  After  being
confronted  at  the  end  of  the  interview,  he  acknowledged  eight  delinquent  accounts,
including the five alleged in the SOR. He claimed that he did not list them on his SCA
because he did not find out that they were delinquent until after he submitted  it in July
2016.  By  September  2016,  three  of  the  alleged  debts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c  –  1.e)  were  in
collection status and delinquent at least 180 days, and the other two (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.b)
were delinquent at least 90 days. (Item 6 at 9-10; Item 5 at 6, 8 and 13; FORM at 3)
During  the  initial  discussion  about  his  specific  delinquent  debts,  Applicant
averred that each of them were current as of the date of the SI. He later admitted that
they were not, in fact, current because his divorce attorney advised him not to pay them
until  the  divorce  was  finalized  (which  had  not  yet  occurred).  While  the  Government
argued  the  inconsistencies  among  Applicant’s  various  SI  statements,  its  falsification
allegation  in  the  SOR  pertained  only  to  the  SCA  not  the  SI.  As  such,  it  will  be
considered  only  to  evaluate  mitigation  and  the  whole-person  concept.  (Item  6  at  9-10;
FORM at 3)
Applicant’s  SOR  answer  (including  February  and  March  2019  letters,  and  two
April  2019  emails)  also  contained  inconsistent  statements  about  when  he  first  knew
about  his  financial  indebtedness.  In  the  February  letter,  he  attributed  his  financial
indebtedness  to  his  period  of  unemployment  between  March  2015  and  July  2016,  his
divorce  proceedings,  and  the  fact  that  he  had  two  children  in  college.  He  stated  that,
during  that  time,  he  incurred  “a  significant  amount  of  debt”  in  order  to  support himself
and  his  family.  He  asserted  that  he  had  been  working  to  settle  his  debts  since  he
regained employment in August 2016. Although the date of his divorce is not otherwise
specified  in  the  record,  he  referred  to  his  “ex-wife”  in  the  February  letter,  which
presumes that his divorce had been finalized by then.
In the March letter, Applicant repeated the aforementioned facts of his February
letter  and  added  a  comment  about  the  falsification  allegation:  that  he  did  not  have
knowledge of the debts alleged in the SOR until 2018. In the first April email, he stated
that, at the time he completed his SCA in 2016, he had no knowledge of the credit-card
debts  caused  by  his  divorce.  Without  specifying  a  date,  he  stated  that  his  debts  had
“recently surface[d]” when he was contacted by a collection agency. He averred that his
financial record was “impeccable and in great standing” until his divorce.  In the second
April email, he reiterated that he had “no knowledge of financial delinquency” at the time
he  completed his SCA,  and  that he  learned of his  delinquencies  after being  contacted
by a collection agency “after [his] divorce.”
The  record  did  not  enumerate  either  the  income  that  Applicant  earned  from  his
full-time and part-time employment, or his expenses (besides the $2,500 per month he
paid or has been paying over an unspecified period for alimony and housing), during the
relevant period immediately preceding his unemployment through present. (Item 6 at 7).
The  Government  identified  the areas  in  which  Applicant failed  to  provide  documentary
evidence  to  support  his  mitigation  case.  He  was  also  advised  of  the  opportunity  to
submit that evidence in his FORM response. He did not respond to the FORM. (FORM
at 2-3)
