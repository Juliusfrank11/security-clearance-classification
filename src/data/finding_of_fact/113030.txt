The SOR alleges that Applicant had four delinquent consumer accounts totaling
$26,521.  Applicant  admits  SOR  ¶  1.b,  a  $3,062  credit-card  debt,  but  denies  the  other
three allegations. The debts are reflected in Applicant’s credit bureau reports (CBR) from
May 2019, December 2018, and October 2016. (GX 6; GX 5; GX 4.)
Applicant  is  a  53-year-old  staff  engineer  currently  employed  by  a  defense
contractor  since  December  1999,  and  periodically  employed  by  the  same  defense
contractor from  1989 until 1996.  Applicant  received  his bachelor’s  degree  in  1988.  He
and his current wife married in 2012. He was previously married from 1991 until 2010. He
has three children and three step-children, none of whom reside with Applicant and his
wife. He received his first security clearance in 1989. (GX 1; Tr. 38.)
In 2015, Applicant’s employer offered him a lateral transfer to a facility in another
state.  Applicant  thought  the  transfer  would  offer  him  greater  opportunities  within  his
employment, as well as afford him a better cost-of-living. In March 2015, Applicant listed
his house for sale. He accepted the offer in April 2015 and moved to another state, where
he rented a house. Although his daughter resided in his house in his previous state of
residence, Applicant retained responsibility for paying the mortgage loan and the utilities
while the house was on the market. The house sold in November 2015. (AX A; Tr. 20-
22.)
After relocating, Applicant was required to purchase household furnishings for his
new home. Due to the outlay of paying rent, furnishing his new home, and maintaining a
mortgage  and  utilities  on  his  previous  home  for  a  period  of  eight  months,  Applicant
amassed significant credit-card debt which became delinquent. Applicant purchased the
home he had been renting in November 2015 after the sale of his prior home. The assets
from the sale were used for the purchase of the new home, and did not go toward reducing
Applicant’s  credit-card  debt.  (Tr.  22-23.)  Applicant  has  not  had  any  delinquencies  on
either of his mortgage loans. (GX 4; GX 5.)
Concerned  about  his  delinquent  accounts,  Applicant
to  an
advertisement for a debt-consolidation company (DCC) and entered an agreement with
the DCC in June 2016. The DCC instructed Applicant not to make any payments to or
have any contact with any of his creditors.  Applicant was required to pay $600 into an
escrow  account  at  a  specific  bank  which  charged  transactional  fees.  The  DCC  was
responded
authorized to withdraw Applicant’s escrowed funds to cover fees and pay settlements on
Applicant’s behalf. (Tr. 44-47.)
The four SOR debts and one additional debt were the outstanding accounts that
Applicant contracted with the DCC to resolve. The DCC settled the non-SOR debt. Based
on information that Applicant received from the DCC, he also thought that the DCC had
settled  the  $3,062  credit-card  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1b  in  September  2017,  and  was
working to resolve the other three SOR debts. (AX G; Tr. 23-25.) The four SOR debts
went to collection between July and November 2016. (GX 5.)
In January 2018, Applicant learned that despite his $600 monthly payments into
the  escrow  account,  the  DCC  had  resolved  only  the  one  non-SOR  account,  and  his
remaining  balance  in  escrow  was  $300.  Applicant  terminated  his  relationship  with  the
DCC and awaited contact by the remaining creditors. (AX A; Tr. 24-25.) Applicant accepts
responsibility for the debts that he incurred and states that it is his obligation to repay or
otherwise resolve these accounts. (Tr. 32-33.)
In January 2019, Applicant received an IRS Form 1099-C cancellation of debt for
the  $4,821  credit-card  debt alleged  in  SOR ¶  1.d.  He properly  filed  the document  and
made the appropriate adjustments when filing his 2018 tax return. (AX A.) This debt  is
resolved.
In March 2019, Applicant was contacted by the creditor of the $1,770 credit-card
debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c and offered a settlement agreement. Applicant settled this debt
in full on March 31, 2019. (AX A.) Applicant was also contacted in March 2019 by the
creditor  of  the  $3,062  credit-card  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  He  entered  a  six-month
settlement agreement which was settled in full in September 2019. (AX A; AX B; Tr. 27.)
These two debts are resolved.
In January 2019, Applicant was served with a subpoena by the collection creditor
for the $16,868 credit-card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. Applicant retained an attorney who
began settlement negotiations with the creditor. The parties signed a final stipulation for
settlement on October 2, 2019. Applicant agreed to pay $1,200 at $100 a month with the
final payment being due on October 1, 2020. (AX I.) This debt is being resolved.
Applicant’s  four  coworkers,  one  of  whom  has  also  managed  Applicant  over  the
past four years, and another who was mentored by Applicant, who are aware of the SOR
allegations, collectively highly recommend Applicant for security clearance stating that he
is honest, trustworthy, and professional. (AX F.)
Applicant’s credit history dating back to 1989 shows consistent repayment of credit
cards, vehicle loans, and mortgages. The only delinquent accounts are those that arose
as a result of Applicant’s relocation and the associated expenses. (AX 4; AX 6.) Applicant
lives  within  his  means,  has  not  incurred  any  recent  delinquent  debts,  and  is  able  to
maintain his ongoing financial obligations. He maintains a budget on a spreadsheet, and
he and his wife sit down weekly to manage their accounts. (Tr. 35.) He has approximately
$9,000 in his combined checking and savings accounts and is entitled to a pension from
his employer. He has a monthly remainder of approximately $1,000. (Tr. 31.) Applicant
was candid, sincere, and credible during his testimony.
