Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since May 2019. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from
1991  until  he  was  honorably  discharged  in  2000.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree,  which
was awarded in 2005, and additional college credits but no post-graduate degree. He is
divorced with four children between the ages of 19 and 23. (Tr. at 13, 21-23, 26-29; GE
1, 2)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  problems,  which  he  attributed  to  his  2002
divorce, high child support payments, the loss of his job in 2015, and the subsequent six
months  of  unemployment.  He  filed  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  case  in  July  2007  as  a
means  to  keep  his  house  from  foreclosure.  The  petition  listed  $293,000  owed  on  a
mortgage loan; $40,000 for an auto loan on a sport utility vehicle (SUV), and $6,500 in
unsecured claims. The bankruptcy was dismissed in September 2007. (Tr. at 13-14, 26-

Applicant  did  not  pay  all  of  his  federal  and  state  income  taxes  when  they  were
due.  In  April  2018,  he  estimated  that  he  owed  the  IRS  $20,000.  He  indicated  post-
hearing that he has been in contact with the IRS, who informed him that he owed more
than  $60,000.  He  stated  that  he  sent  IRS  Form  433-F  (Collection  Information
Statement)  to  the  IRS  to  begin  the  process  of  making  payment  arrangements.  He
provided  a  blank  copy  of  an  IRS  Form  433-F.  (Tr.  at  16-18,  35;  GE  1-3;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; AE B-D)
From 2011 to 2017, Applicant’s state imposed about $90,000 in tax liens against
him.  The  liens  are  not  listed  on  his  most-recent  credit  reports,  but  Applicant  admitted
that he owes his state more than $111,000. He wrote that the state has yet to send him
any forms, and he is “still reaching out to them.” (Tr. at 14-20, 33-35; GE 1-3; AE B, C,
E-G)
Applicant  did  not  pay  his  mortgage  loan.  Credit  reports  from  January  2018,
January  2019,  and  April  2019  listed  the  loan  as  $75,780  past  due  and  in  foreclosure,
with a balance of $323,324, and a date of last action of May 2015. He lost his home to
foreclosure. There is no evidence that the house has been sold or if there is a deficiency
on the loan after a sale. (Tr. at 18-19, 31-33; GE 2, 4, 5; Applicant’s response to SOR;
AE E)
Applicant bought a 2007 sports car  for about $50,000  in July 2010. He still had
the sports car when he bought an SUV in November 2011 that was financed with a loan
of about $71,000, with monthly payments of $1,325 for 73 months.  He stopped paying
the loan on the sports car at some point. The car was not repossessed. He maintained
the car at a friend’s house, at least in part so that the creditor could not repossess it.  A
January 2018 credit report listed the charged-off loan for the sports car with a $12,433
balance. Applicant settled and paid the debt in about August 2018. He sold the car after
the  lien  was  released.  He  also  stopped  paying  the  loan  for  the  SUV,  and  it  was
repossessed. He bought his current vehicle in October 2018, which was financed with a
loan of about $47,000, with $857 monthly payments. (Tr. at 37-41; Applicant’s response
to SOR; GE 1, 2, 4, 5; AE A)
SOR  ¶¶  1.f  and  1.g  allege  debts  of  $191  and  $38.  The  debts  are  listed  on  a
January 2018 credit report with dates of last action on the accounts listed as December
2011  and  January  2012.  Applicant  denied  owing  the  debts,  and  they  are  not  listed  on
the 2019 credit reports. (Tr. at 41; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 4, 5; AE E-G)
Applicant’s  annual  salary  is  about  $150,000.  Except  for  the  six  months  of
unemployment  in  2015,  he  has  been  consistently  employed  with  annual  salaries  in
excess  of  $100,000.  He  received  financial  counseling  while  he  was  in  the  military.  He
asks to retain his security clearance so that he can keep his job and pay his taxes. (Tr.
