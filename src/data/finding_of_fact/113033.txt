In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  denied  the
remaining allegations in SOR ¶ 1. He denied the two allegations in SOR ¶ 2.
Applicant is 57 years old and has been married since 1983. He and his wife have
two  adult  children.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1987.  In  July  2017,  he  started  a
position with a defense contractor. Prior to this employment, he had been self-employed
since 2012. Before starting his business, he was a contractor for different companies and
also experienced periods of unemployment. (Tr. 21-27; GE 1)
Based on credit bureau reports (CBR) from August 2017 and January 2019, and
Applicant’s admissions, the SOR alleged four delinquent  commercial debts, and stated
four additional allegations related to his unfiled Federal and state income tax returns and
unpaid Federal tax liens. (GE 2, GE 3, GE 4, GE 5) The status of those financial matters
is as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a: The $28,865 second mortgage debt has been delinquent and charged
off since March 2014. Applicant has no intention to resolve it until he sells the house at a
future date. (Tr. 31-33; Answer) This allegation is unresolved.
SOR  ¶  1.b:  This  $947  credit  card  debt  became  delinquent  in  August  2016.
Applicant said he settled it for $521 and paid it in March 2019. (Tr. 33-35) This allegation
is resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.c:  This  charged-off  $453  credit  card  debt  became  delinquent  in  2016.
Applicant disputes the  charge,  but provided no evidence  substantiating  a  basis for the
dispute. (Tr. 35-37: GE 3; Answer) This allegation is unresolved.
SOR  ¶  1.d:  The  $280  collection  account  for  an  unpaid  phone  bill  became
delinquent in 2017. Applicant said he disputes this charge and has no intention of paying
it, but provided no substantiation. (Tr. 37-39; Answer) This allegation is unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.e: Applicant has not filed his Federal and state income tax returns since
1992. He stated that he declined to file them because he does not consent to being taxed
on his labor, such as a payroll tax; hence, he believes he is not legally required to file the
the returns. (Tr. 40-45; Answer) This allegation is unresolved.
SOR  ¶  1.f:  Applicant  has  not  paid  the  $38,215  Federal  income  tax  lien  entered
against him in October 2018. Applicant does not intend to pay the debt because he does
not believe he has a legal obligation to pay taxes on his labor, unless he consents to the
tax. (Tr. 45-46; Answer) This allegation is unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.g: Applicant has not paid the $61,297 Federal income tax lien entered
against him in October 2005. He does not intend to pay the debt because he does not
believe he has a legal obligation to pay taxes on his labor, unless he consents to the tax.
(Tr. 45-46; Answer) This allegation is unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.h: Applicant has not paid the $351,636 Federal income tax lien entered
against him in April 2004. He does not intend to pay the debt because he does not believe
he has a legal obligation to pay taxes on his labor, unless he consents to the tax. This
large lien is partially attributable to capital gains he earned in the early 2000s, in addition
to income from employment. (Tr. 45-46, 58-60; Answer) This allegation is unresolved.
SOR ¶ 2 alleges Applicant deliberately denied and failed to disclose his failure to
file  his  tax  returns  and  his tax  liens  on  his  August  2017  security  clearance  application
(SCA). In that SCA, he denied that he had not filed Federal and state income tax returns
since 1992, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e. Applicant asserted that he did not falsify his SCA
about this issue because he did not believe he was legally required to file tax returns, as
he did not consent to being taxed on employment income. (Tr. 48-49; GE 2; Answer)
In his August 2017 SCA, Applicant also denied that tax liens had been placed on
his property for tax years 2011, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. He did not disclose that he
was  indebted  to  the  United  States  for  Federal  income  taxes  in  the  total  amount  of
$451,148 for the Federal tax liens alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h. He has since denied
that he deliberately failed to disclose that information. He stated that he was unaware of
the unpaid taxes and liens. He claimed that he ignored notices he and his wife received
relating to them. He asserted that he is not required to file returns or pay taxes on any
payroll money he received over the years. (Tr. 47-51; GE 2; Answer)
Applicant  did  not  pay  income  taxes  from  1992  until  2001.  At  that  time,  he  was
purchasing  a  home  and  in  order  to  obtain  a  mortgage,  he  paid  the  Internal  Revenue
Service (IRS) $6,500 to resolve a tax lien and purchase a house. (Tr. 52) In March 2019,
he said he mistakenly paid the IRS about $2,500 from his salary because he did not fill
out his W-2 Form correctly and failed to claim he was exempt from paying taxes. Other
than those two instances, 2001 and 2019, he has not paid Federal or state income taxes
since 1992. (Tr. 53-55)
