In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations,  with  explanations.
After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of
fact.
Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He began working
at his present job in November 2017. He is a standardization and evaluations assistant.
He  served  in  the  Air National  Guard from  1984  to  2015, attaining  the  grade of  master
sergeant (E-7). He has a high school diploma. He has been married three times (1990-
1997; 1998-2005; 2016-present) and has three adult children. (Item 3)
The SOR alleged that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2019; that
he  owed  delinquent  federal  taxes  for  2015  ($1,713)  and  2016  ($5,019);  and  that  he
accumulated  25  delinquent  debts  (mortgage  debts,  credit  card  debt,  consumer  debts,
medical debt;  and  various  other debt)  totaling  approximately  $52,791. The debts  were
listed in credit reports from March 2018 and January 2019 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.bb). (Items
1, 6-7)
Applicant pointed out in his statement to a defense investigator that his financial
troubles  mounted  when  he  accepted  an  overseas  job,  which  paid  about  $25,000  less
than  what  he  was  earning.  Additionally,  his  wife  was  unable  to  secure  employment  at
the overseas location in her skill area and settled on taking a lesser-paying job. These
decisions  were  voluntarily  made  by  Applicant  because  he  wanted  to  experience  living
overseas with his wife. (Items 2, 4 (August 2018 subject interview))
Applicant  stopped  paying  a  home  improvement  loan  in  approximately  October
2017, when he took the overseas job. His credit reports show that several other debts
became  delinquent  around  this  time.  He  contacted  several  creditors  about  payment
plans, but he could not afford the payments they were seeking. In September 2017, he
signed an agreement with an attorney to pursue bankruptcy proceedings. The record is
silent  as  to  any  further  dealings  with  that  attorney.  In  April  2019,  Applicant  used  a
different  attorney  to  file  a  Chapter  7  petition.  All  the  SOR  debts  were  included  in  the
bankruptcy.  The  debts  were  discharged  in  August  2019,  except  that  Applicant’s  2015
and  2016  federal  tax  debts  were  not  discharged  and  his  mortgage  on  his  residence
remained enforceable. (Items 2, 4-7; AE B)
Applicant claims that his 2015 federal tax debt was either paid with his 2018 tax
refund  or  “charged-off”  through  bankruptcy.  He  failed  to  supply  documentation
supporting either of these actions. He claims to be making $200 monthly payments on
his  2016  federal  tax  debt,  but  again  failed  to  supply  supporting  documentation.
Applicant supplied documentation showing that in May 2019, he listed his home for sale
with a realtor in an attempt to execute a short sale of the property. There is no evidence
showing the result of this attempted sale. Applicant completed the required bankruptcy
financial counseling course. He disclosed to a defense investigator that his net monthly
income  is  approximately  $5,343,  with  expenses  of  approximately  $4,550,  leaving  a
remainder of approximately $800. (Items 2, 4)
Applicant provided a recommendation letter from his current supervisor who is a
retired  Air  Force  officer.  His  supervisor  recommends  that  Applicant  retain  his  security
clearance  citing  his  overall  excellent  duty  performance  and  his  observed
trustworthiness. (AE C)
