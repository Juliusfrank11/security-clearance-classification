Applicant is a 40-year-old information technology support technician, sponsored
by a defense contractor since January 2019. He will begin working for the contractor only
if  he  receives  a  security  clearance.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  1997  and  has
completed some college credits. He is single and has no children. Applicant enlisted in
the U.S. Air Force in 1998, and was discharged in 2001 with a general discharge under
honorable conditions. Applicant held a security clearance from 1998 to 2016.
The SOR alleges Applicant failed to file federal income tax returns for tax years
2005, and 2007 to 2009 (SOR ¶ 1.a); he failed to timely file federal income tax returns for
2006,  2010,  2011,  and  2013  to  2015  (SOR  ¶  1.b);  and  he  is  indebted  to  the  Federal
Government for delinquent taxes for tax years 2010 totaling $30,252 (SOR ¶ 1.c); 2011
totaling  $47,295  (SOR  ¶  1.d);  2015  totaling  $15,317  (SOR  ¶  1.e);  and  2016  totaling
$13,075 (SOR ¶ 1.f).
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to not filing his 2007 tax return when
due, but stated that he filed his 2007 to 2012 tax returns in 2013. Applicant admitted that
tax  returns  for  2006,  2010,  2011,  and  2013  to  2015  were  not  filed  when  due,  with
explanations.  Finally,  Applicant  admitted  having  federal  tax  debts  for  tax  years  2010,
2011,  2015,  and  2016,  but  stated  that  he  has  entered  into  a  monthly  installment
repayment plan with the IRS and has made payments since November 2017.
Applicant deployed overseas as a civilian contractor to: Qatar from 2003 to 2005;
Kuwait from 2005-2009; Spain (on a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) contract)
from 2009 to 2012; and Afghanistan from 2014 to 2017. He contends that he was entitled
to delay his federal income tax filings and payments while he was deployed to a “combat
zone,” and did not have to file tax returns or make tax payments until 180 days after his
last day in the combat zone, with additional adjustments based on the date he entered
the combat zone. It is generally understood that this IRS rule applies to certain civilian
contractors  working  in  support  of  U.S.  military  operations  in  “combat  zones.”  Qatar,
Kuwait, and Afghanistan are considered “combat zones” for purposes of the IRS rule.
Applicant did not provide documentary evidence showing that this IRS provision
applied to his particular deployments, the specific dates that his tax returns would have
been due under the rule, or whether he filed applicable tax returns within the allowable
period. Assuming the rule applied to Applicant’s last qualifying deployment to Kuwait in
2009,  it  appears  he  would  have  been  required  to  file  his  “delayed”  federal  income  tax
returns, and pay taxes owed, within the 180-day deadline after leaving Kuwait. Although
Applicant never filed his 2005 federal income tax return, he filed his 2006 tax return in
November 2010, which may have been within the filing deadline (and paid the tax owed
over the phone in June and December 2007 after receiving an IRS notice and speaking
with an IRS employee on the phone). His tax returns for tax years 2007 to 2012 were filed
in 2013 after returning from Spain. It appears that these tax return filings were outside the
“combat zone” exclusion period permitted by the rule as there is no evidence that work
for NATO in Spain qualifies for the “combat zone” or other exclusion.
Applicant  deployed  to  Afghanistan  in  2014  and  returned  in  2017,  and  filed  tax
returns for 2013 to 2016, in 2017. Again, he may have filed within the IRS “combat zone”
exclusion rule, but did not make that clear in testimony or evidence submitted. Of note,
Applicant’s IRS transcripts for tax years 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2015 show penalties were
assessed, inter alia, for filing tax returns after their normal due dates. (GE 3)
In 2006, Applicant called the IRS from Kuwait to ask about when he was required
to file tax returns. In testimony, he relayed a vague recollection of the conversation, but
recalled  that  he  had  a  90  day  extension  and  did  not  have  to  file  a  tax  return  until  he
returned to the United States as long as he did not owe any tax. He claimed that he made
a rough estimate as to how much tax was being withheld from his pay, and what he might
owe. He held the same understanding for tax years 2007 to 2009. When Applicant moved
to Spain in 2009, he claimed that he was given conflicting information by a NATO official
and the IRS, and said; “I heard – more or less, I heard what I wanted to hear,” that he had
a similar “combat zone” exclusion delay while working in Spain under a NATO contract.
(Tr. 40) Applicant took responsibility for not inquiring further, and acknowledged that he
made a mistake, partially due to depression after his father passed away in 2010, partially
from ignorance, and because he “stopped caring.” (Tr. 41-42) While overseas, Applicant
traveled extensively for personal pleasure to several countries in Europe, the Middle East,
and South America.
Applicant hired a tax consultant in July 2013, who told him the IRS would only be
interested in the previous six years and not to be concerned with filing the tax year 2005
return  as  he  did  not  owe  anything  that  year.  Applicant  filed  his tax  year  2007  to  2012
returns  with  that  consultant.  He  hired  another  tax  consulting  group  in  2017  who  filed
returns for tax years 2013 to 2017.
Applicant did not pay his federal income taxes when due, for tax years 2010, 2011,
2015,  and  2016.  Applicant  testified  that  he  earned  about  $120,000  per  year  while  in
Afghanistan and had very low expenses. He noted that he helped family members with
expenses,  but  he  could  not  account  for  how  much  money  he  gave  away.  He  spent
hundreds of thousands of dollars earned in Afghanistan on personal travel and hosting
friends.  (Tr.  70-76)  Applicant  admitted  that  he  did  not  properly  plan  to  pay  his  tax
obligations, and when he returned from Afghanistan in 2017, he used the savings he had
accumulated to pay for his living expenses while seeking a job. (Tr. 67) As of October
2018, he owed over $105,000 in unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest. Applicant entered
into  a  payment  plan  with  the  IRS,  and  agreed  to  pay  $75  per  month,  beginning  in
November 2017. He has made the required monthly payments.
Applicant’s  character  letters  note  his  integrity,  honesty,  work  ethic,  and  positive
character  traits.  Applicant  testified  that  he  currently  earns  over  $120,000  in  pay  and
veteran’s benefits, has about $12,000 in savings, and about $10,000 in a 401K retirement
fund. He has not had any financial counseling since leaving active duty.
Law and Policies
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484  U.S.  518, 528  (1988). As  Commander in  Chief,  the President  has  the  authority  to
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is  clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An
administrative  judge  must  consider  a  person’s  stability,  trustworthiness,  reliability,
discretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG ¶ 1(b).
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the
possible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant
has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the  President  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  have
established for issuing a clearance.
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the
personal or professional history  of  the applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant from
being  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information.  The  Government  has  the  burden  of
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. “Substantial
evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. Washington
Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a
nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the  criteria  listed
therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3
(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015).
Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG ¶ 1(d).
