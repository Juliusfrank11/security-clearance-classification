The record is void of evidence in mitigation.  Applicant has not explained how or
why  he  fell  behind  on  his  financial  obligations  in  the  first  place,  accumulating  over
$160,000  in  debt.    He  has  not  provided  any  evidence  in  mitigation.    There  is  no
documentary  evidence  to  show  that  he  has  done  anything  to  resolve  his  delinquent
debt.    There  is  nothing  in  the  record  to  indicate  when  his  financial  situation  will  be
resolved,  and  whether  it  is  likely  to  recur.    There  is  insufficient  documentation  in  the
record to show that Applicant can control his finances and live within his means without
difficulty.  He remains excessively indebted.
