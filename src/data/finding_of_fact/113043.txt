In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted,  with  brief  comments,  all  of  the
factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through
1.g.).  He  failed  to  answer  the  newly  added  allegation,  and  his  silence  is  considered  a
denial. Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact.
After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the  evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as an aircraft mechanic with his current employer since September 2014. He previously
served in similar positions with other employers within the United States and overseas,
including  Iraq  and  Afghanistan.  A  1997  high  school  graduate,  Applicant  received  a
technical certification in airframe and propulsion in 1999. He has never served with the
U.S. military. He was determined eligible for a position of public trust in 2009 and 2012,
and  was  granted  a  secret  clearance  in  2013.  He  was  married  in  2004.  He  has  two
children, born in 2002 and 2012.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can  be  found  in  the  following  exhibits:  Item  8  (Combined  Experian,  TransUnion,  and
Equifax  Credit  Report,  dated  August  1,  2018);  Item  9  (Equifax  Credit  Report,  dated
January 11, 2019); Item 6 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated September 19, 2018); and
Item 2 (Applicant’s Answer to SOR, undated).
On January 20, 2015, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator with the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security (DHS). At that time, he was questioned about certain
delinquent  accounts,  and  he  claimed  that  some  of  the  debts  listed  in  an  earlier  credit
report  were  inaccurate,  and  that  his  account  issues  had  been  resolved.  (Item  5) With
respect to his most recent financial issues, Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to
his mother’s 2016 hospitalization and death, especially when Medicare refused to cover
some of her expenses; his daughter’s back surgery, leaving a bill of $300; a September
2017 hurricane; and his wife’s loss of employment due to the hurricane. (Item 6, at 5-6;
Item 4, at 45) In order to resolve his mother’s expenses, Applicant prioritized his bills. As
a result, some of his accounts became delinquent. In December 2016 or January 2017,
in an effort to address his delinquent accounts, Applicant obtained a consolidation loan
from a particular bank. He contended that certain identified accounts were resolved by
the funds he obtained by the loan. (Item 6, at 5) A review of Applicant’s 2018 credit report
reveals three separate accounts from that particular bank, but the one identified during
his interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
reports a $17,340 high credit with a zero balance. The account was 120 days past due,
and closed. (Item 8, at 5) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant identified a different account
as the source of the funds. According to his 2018 credit report, that account has a $16,940
high credit and an unpaid balance of $17,386, of which $501 was past due. None of the
accounts are reported in Applicant’s 2019 credit report.
The SOR, as amended, alleged eight delinquent accounts totaling approximately
$53,821. Five of the eight accounts are ones that Applicant contended he had resolved.
The SOR allegations are set forth below:
SOR  ¶  1.a.:  This is a  student  loan  with  an  unpaid balance  of  $15,224  that  was
transferred to another lender and assigned to the government. (Item 9, at 2-3; Item 8, at
5, 7, and 10) During his September 2018 OPM interview, Applicant stated that he would
contact the U.S. Department of Education to determine who is servicing the loan in order
to establish repayment arrangements. (Item 6, at 6) In his Answer to the SOR, he stated
that he was “currently verifying the current lender.” (Item 2) Over one year has passed
since Applicant made his statement to the OPM investigator, and he has not submitted
any documents to reflect any actions that he may have taken over that period to resolve
the account. In the absence of such documentation, I conclude that the account is not yet
in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.b. through 1.f.: These are a variety of credit cards, charge accounts, and
unspecified types of accounts with unpaid or charged-off balances of $13,790, $2,416,
$1,750, $833, and $499. (Item 8, at 8-9; Item 9, at 2-3; Item 6, at 2) Applicant contended
that these five accounts were paid and resolved by the funds in his consolidation loan.
(Item 6, at 5-6; Item 2) He failed to submit any documentation such as statements from
the creditors agreeing to a repayment plan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a
bank register, or receipts, to indicate that any payments had been made or the accounts
resolved. In the absence of such documentation, I conclude that the accounts are not yet
in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.g.: This is an unspecified type of bank account with an unpaid balance of
$2,293 that was charged off. (Item 8, at 9) Applicant admitted that he is indebted to the
creditor, but contended that he has been making agreed-upon monthly $83 payments.
(Item 2) He did not specify when those payments commenced, and he failed to submit
any documentation, such as a statement from the creditor agreeing to a repayment plan,
cancelled  checks,  copies  of  money  orders,  a  bank  register,  or  receipts,  to  support  his
contention that he has an agreement and that he is making any payments to the creditor.
In  the  absence  of  such  documentation,  I  conclude  that  the  account  is  not  yet  in  the
process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.h.: This is an automobile loan that was opened in December 2014 with a
$27,842  high  credit  and  an  unpaid  balance  of  $17,016  of  which  $988  was  past  due.
Monthly  payments  were  $673,  and  the  account  started  becoming  delinquent  in  June
2018.  (Item  9,  at  1)  Applicant  did  not  address  this  debt.  The  account  has  not  been
resolved.
In January 2015, Applicant presented a financial disclosure report to DHS. In it, he
estimated  assets  of  $197,000,  including  one  residence  and  four  automobiles,  and
estimated $201,000 in liabilities. His total annual income was $65,000. He had $1,759 in
“selected monthly expenses.” (Item 7) It is not known what Applicant’s current financial
resources  may  be  because  he  did  not  report  his  current  net  monthly  income;  monthly
expenses; and any monthly remainder that might be available for discretionary spending
or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of financial counseling.
In  the  absence  of  additional  financial  information,  it  remains  difficult  to  determine  if
Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had been.
