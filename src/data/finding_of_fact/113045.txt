Before he came to the United States, Applicant bought a share of a parcel of land
in India with a friend for about $2,000. Applicant’s share of the property has appreciated
to  about  $75,000.  Applicant  anticipates  that  the  local  restrictions  that  have  made  it
difficult  to  sell  the  property  will  be  lifted.  He  plans  to  sell  the  property  when  they  are
lifted. (Tr. at 55-58; Applicant’s response to SOR; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant’s parents’ home was severely damaged by a natural disaster. Applicant
has  sent  them  about  $200,000  over  several  years  to  help  them  restore  the  home.  He
maintained a bank account in India to make it easier to transfer funds to his parents and
the contractors working on their home. He had about $6,000 in the bank account at one
point, but now that the construction is complete, the balance is about $160. He does not
know whether his parents plan to leave the house to him  as an inheritance. (Tr. at 25-
30, 52-53; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE C)
Applicant  maintains  frequent  contact  with  his  family  in  India.  He  also  regularly
visits them. He visited more often while his parents’ home was under construction. (Tr.

his  family.  His  wife  graduated  from  a  U.S.  university.  His  older  child  is  in  college  with
plans to obtain a PhD. His younger child is in high school and equally enthusiastic about
education. Applicant expressed his undivided allegiance to the United States, which he
considers his home. He credibly testified that his family and any property in India could
not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information, and that he
would  report  any  attempt  to  do  so.  (Tr.  at  21,  31-37,  60-62;  Applicant’s  response  to
