The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of December 19, 2018, Applicant owed
medical collection debt totaling $9,215 on 14 accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.n); a telephone debt
in collection for $392 (SOR ¶ 1.o); and a charged-off debt for $2,067 (SOR ¶ 1.p). (Item 1.)
When he responded to the SOR allegations, Applicant denied only the telephone debt in
SOR ¶ 1.o. He admitted the other debts, which he asserted were the result of illness when
he  was  either  not  covered  by  medical  insurance  or  when  he  had  not  met  the  yearly
deductible under his medical insurance policy. (Item 2.)
After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant’s Answer to the SOR (Item 2),
and AE A, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 53-year-old high school graduate. He has been married to his second
wife since March 1993, and has two children in their early 20s. Applicant completed some
online coursework at a technical institute from June 2007 to December 2007, but earned
no certificate. The institute has ceased operating. Applicant began working in the defense
industry in January 2018. He had held a succession of jobs in the construction, utility, and
telecommunications industries with some brief periods of unemployment from April 2016 to
May 2016 after he resigned, and from March 2017 to July 2017 after he was involuntarily
terminated from a job as a project manager for a construction company. (Items 3, 6.)
On  February  9,  2018,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He listed vacations to the Caribbean
in March 2014 and in August 2015 and a misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct in
August 2004. Regarding financial issues, Applicant disclosed a court judgment for $2,700
awarded  a  former  landlord  in  January  2015  that  was  resolved  in  January  2016.  He
responded negatively to an inquiry concerning any delinquency involving routine accounts
in the last seven years. (Item 3.)
A check of Applicant’s credit on March 20, 2018, revealed a charged-off automobile
loan for $807 with a $1,884 past-due balance (SOR ¶ 1.p); a disputed insurance debt of
$137 in collection since September 2015 (not alleged) and a $293 utility debt (not alleged,
assigned for collection in July 2016. Additionally, medical debts were in collection totaling
$7,748. The medical debts were placed for collection on various dates between June 2012
and December 2017. Applicant was disputing one of the medical debts, which had been
placed for collection in September 2012 for $980 (not alleged) and was reportedly still
unpaid as of March 2018. A student loan charged off for $3,151 was in collection with a
$4,899 balance (not alleged). Three student loan accounts were in collection for $7,748
(not alleged). A student loan obtained in October 2016 for $2,013 was charged off for $335
in February 2018 (not alleged). (Item 5.)
On August 6, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  When  given  the  opportunity  to  divulge
information regarding any delinquent debts, Applicant volunteered no information. He was
then confronted with the adverse accounts on his credit record. He expressed his belief
that the medical collection debts were all incurred from emergency appointments, and that
some of the debts might be duplicate listings with different collection entities. He indicated
that he would make payments on the debts now that he had stable employment. Regarding
the delinquent student loans, Applicant advised that the debts were not behind more than
90 days. Concerning the car loan that was past due for $1,884, Applicant indicated that he
was unaware of the debt, but surmised that it might be a medical debt from his issues in
February 2018 and March 2018. He described his financial situation as currently stable.
(Item 6.)
As of December 2018, Applicant was legally liable on four car loans: a $40,707 car
loan obtained in August 2017 (balance $37,422, $865 monthly payments); an $11,750 car
loan obtained in December 2015 (balance $3,876, $394 monthly payments); a $35,386 car
loan obtained in February 2017 (balance $28,503, $607 monthly payments); and a $9,978
car loan obtained in October 2018 ($217 monthly payments). The car loans were being
repaid on time for the most part. He had made no payments toward the charged-off May
2012 car loan (SOR ¶ 1.p). The loan was listed as $2,067 past due, but with a balance of
$807, the amount charged off on the loan. Several medical debts totaling $10,193 (SOR ¶¶
1.a-1.n and a $978 unalleged medical debt from May 2018) were reportedly in collection.
Additionally, a $392 telephone services debt (SOR ¶ 1.o), a $1,420 debt (not alleged), and
a $137 insurance debt from July 2015 (not alleged) were reportedly also past due and in
collection. (Item 4.)
On March 19, 2019, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant, alleging $9,215 in
medical collection debt, the $392 telecommunications debt, and the May 2012 charged-off
car loan as a debt of $2,067. (Item 1.) In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the
debts  but  for  the  telephone  debt,  which  he  claimed  was  being  reported  erroneously
because he was in good standing with the service provider. He expressed a mistaken belief
that  the  car  loan  was  a  medical  debt.  He  explained  that  his  medical  debts  were  for
treatment for a potentially life-threatening condition when he was employed as a contactor
and not covered by medical insurance or had not met his yearly deductible. Concerning his
failure to resolve the debts, Applicant stated:
I  have  taken  responsibility  for  these  items  and  have  made  payments  on
multiple past due bills. It is just taking time to catch them all up and certain
entities would rather destroy or cause harm to people than work with them to
resolve [the debts]. In some cases, a few of these bills went straight into
collection  with  a  two-week  time  frame  of  not  receiving  a  payment  or  me
asking for time due to no monies coming in.
Applicant added that he would not betray his country for some $11,000 of debt and
that denial of clearance eligibility would be a financial setback that would compromise his
ability to repay his debt obligations. (Item 2.)
The Government posited in the FORM that Applicant had not acted responsibly to
resolve his debts, citing his trips to the Caribbean and financing a car for approximately
$40,000  in  2017  while  some  debts  went  unpaid.  In  rebuttal  to  the  FORM,  Applicant
indicated on April 15, 2019, that he has been “making a valiant effort” to resolve the issues
on his credit report in that in less than two years, he has made payments totaling $18,030
to  his creditors. He  contested  the  legitimacy  only of the phone debt in SOR ¶ 1.o. He
added that some “things are not being reported correctly” on his credit report; that creditors
are slow to remove negative entries that have been resolved; and that some creditors are
not willing to accept affordable repayment arrangements and would rather cause harm by
filing for collection. (AE A.)
Applicant provided documentation showing that, in June 2009, he satisfied a $625
judgment  for  delinquent  state  taxes.  In  February  2017,  he  paid  a  $749  utility  bill  in
collection.  In  May  2017,  he  paid  a  $496  share-draft  deficiency  to  a  credit  union.  In
November 2018, he apparently satisfied a charged-off credit card debt. He arranged in
January  2017  to  repay  $8,913  in  student-loan  collection  debt  at  $184  a  month.  He
submitted his spouse’s credit report with handwritten entries noting calls to creditors and
apparently reflecting settlement amounts for some accounts on her credit. She paid $60 to
resolve a wireless phone debt in her name in February 2017, and $124 on a credit card
account in May 2017. Applicant arranged to make a  $375 payment on April 19, 2019,
toward a $780 debt in collection. (AE A.) Some of the documents show debts as paid but
not the amounts. However, his documentation does not establish that any of the debts that
were satisfied, settled, or are being repaid are those alleged in the SOR.
