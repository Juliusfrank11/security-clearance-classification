In his initial Answer to the SOR, Applicant failed to admit or deny any of the SOR
allegations. Instead, he addressed the allegations and offered comments regarding each
allegation. In his Supplemental Answer, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, nearly
all, or parts thereof, of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the
SOR  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b.  through  1.i.,  1.k.  through  1.n.,  and  1.p.  through  1.t.).  Applicant’s
admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete
and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same,
I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as an outside electrician with his current employer since May 2017. A 1998 high school
graduate, Applicant received  a technical certification  in electrical business in 2016. He
has never served with the U.S. military, and he never registered with the Selective Service
System (SSS), claiming that he was not aware of the SSS until 2010, when he applied
for a student loan.  He has never held a security clearance. Applicant was never married,
and he has no children.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can be found in the following exhibits: Item 8 (Combined Experian and TransUnion Credit
Report, dated March 4, 2017); Item 7 (Equifax Credit Report, dated  August 28, 2018);
Item  6  (Equifax  Credit  Report,  dated  August  28,  2019);  Item  5  (Enhanced  Subject
Interview, dated March 30, 2018); Item 5 (Applicant’s Response to the Interrogatories,
dated  February  22,  2019;  Item  2  (Applicant’s  Answer  to  SOR,  undated);  Item  3
(Applicant’s Supplemental Answer, dated June 14, 2019); and Applicant’s Response to
the FORM, dated September 10, 2019.
Applicant was unemployed over several periods during 2015, 2016, and 2017, with
his most recent period being from October 2016 until May 2017. During those periods, he
searched
for  new  employment,  and  was  supported  either  by  unemployment
compensation, funds from his 401k, or by his parents. (Item 4, at 10-18; Item 5 (Enhanced
Subject Interview), at 5) Applicant stated that he was in a relationship with someone who
was authorized to use “a couple” of his accounts, and some of his credit card debt was
attributed  to  her.  (Response  to  the  FORM,  at  1)  During  Applicant’s  periods  of
unemployment,  he  did  not  generate  sufficient funds  to maintain his financial accounts,
and many of them became delinquent. Some of the delinquent accounts were charged
off, and some were sold or transferred to debt purchasers. In addition, due to Applicant’s
self-described “laziness,” as well as not having much income, Applicant failed to timely
file federal and state income tax returns for the tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015,
and 2016. (Item 5 (Enhanced Subject Interview), at 6)
When Applicant completed his November 2016 e-QIP, he acknowledged having
six delinquent accounts, as well as having failed to file his federal and state income tax
returns for several tax years. (Item 4, at 29-37)  In March 2018, during his interview with
an  investigator  from  the  U.S.  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM),  Applicant
discussed his unfiled tax returns, delinquent student loans, and one previously delinquent
credit card. It was only after he was confronted with additional delinquent accounts that
he shared the facts associated with those accounts.
The SOR alleged six  unfiled federal and state income tax returns as well as 17
delinquent accounts totaling approximately $63,236. Applicant contended that some of
the  SOR  allegations  duplicated  other  SOR  allegations.  Regarding  those  accounts  for
which he had not yet taken any steps to resolve, Applicant indicated that he would contact
the creditors to set up repayment plans. The SOR allegations are set forth below:
SOR ¶ 1.a.: This refers to Applicant’s failure to file his federal income tax return for
the  tax  year  2009,  as  required.  In  his  e-QIP,  during  his  OPM  interview,  and  in  his
Response to the Interrogatories, Applicant acknowledged that he did not file the subject
income  tax  return.  (Item  4,  at  29;  Item  5  (Enhanced  Subject  Interview),  at  6);  Item  5
(Response  to  the  Interrogatories),  at  13)  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant
acknowledged that he could not confirm the status of the filing of the income tax return.
(Item  2,  at  1)  In  his  Supplemental  Answer  to  the  SOR,  he  contended  that  the  Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) had no record of him not filing an income tax return for the tax
year 2009. (Item 3, at 1) However, the IRS acknowledged that a federal income tax return
for the tax year 2009 was filed on August 4, 2010, and processed on August 23, 2010.
(Item  5  (IRS  Account  Transcript,  dated  March  17,  2019)  That  Account  Transcript  was
furnished to DOHA on February 22, 2019, nearly two months before the SOR was issued.
The allegation has been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b.: This refers to Applicant’s failure to file his federal income tax returns
for the tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016. In his Supplemental Answer
to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he had failed to timely file those federal income tax
returns (Item 3, at 1), but noted that had recently done so. The IRS confirmed that with
respect to the tax year 2010, as of March 17, 2019, no such return had been filed, but a
tax return was received by the IRS on April 29, 2019; for the tax year 2011, as of March
17, 2019, no such return had been filed, but a tax return was received by the IRS on April
29, 2019; for the tax year 2012, as of March 17, 2019, no such return had been filed, but
a tax return was received by the IRS on April 29, 2019; for the tax year 2015, as of March
17, 2019, no such return had been filed, but a tax return was received by the IRS on April
29, 2019; and for the tax year 2016, as of March 17, 2019, no such return had been filed,
but a tax return was received by the IRS on April 29, 2019. (Item 5 (Account Transcripts
attached to Response to Interrogatories); Item 3 (U.S. Individual Income Tax Returns)
There is a legal requirement to file a federal income tax return, and it is based upon
an  individual’s  gross  income  and  other  enumerated  conditions.  Once  it  is  determined,
under 26 U.S.C. § 7203, Willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, that there is an
obligation to so file, the following applies:
Any  person  required  under  this  title  to  pay  any  estimated  tax  or  tax,  or
required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make
a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to
pay  such  estimated  tax  or  tax,  make  such  return,  keep  such  records,  or
supply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations,
shall,  in  addition  to  other  penalties  provided  by  law,  be  guilty  of  a
misdemeanor  and,  upon  conviction  thereof,  shall  be  fined  not  more  than
$25,000  ($100,000  in the  case of a  corporation),  or imprisoned not  more
than 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution. In the case of
any person with respect to whom there is a failure to pay any estimated tax,
this  section  shall  not  apply  to  such  person  with  respect  to  such  failure  if
there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect to such
failure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the
first  sentence  of  this  section  shall  be  applied  by  substituting  "felony"  for
"misdemeanor" and "5 years" for "1 year."
There is no evidence that Applicant made any efforts to contact the IRS until March
17, 2019 – nearly one year after his OPM interview; or to  file his multi-year delinquent
federal tax returns until April 29, 2019 – over one year after his OPM interview, and two
weeks after the SOR was issued. While the federal income tax returns have now been
filed, none of them were timely filed as required by law. The issues regarding the federal
income tax returns have not been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c.: This refers to Applicant’s failure to file his state income tax returns for
the tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016. In his Supplemental Answer to
the SOR, Applicant admitted that he had failed to timely file those state income tax returns
(Item  3,  at  1),  but  noted  that  had  recently  done  so.  The  state  department  of  revenue
services confirmed that with respect to the tax year 2010, a tax return was received on
April 30, 2019; for the tax year 2011, a tax return was received on April 30, 2019; for the
tax year 2012, a tax return was received on April 30, 2019; for the tax year 2015, a tax
return was received on April 30, 2019; and for the tax year 2016, a tax return was received
on April 30, 2019. (Item 3 (State Individual Tax Returns))
There  is  no  evidence  that  Applicant  made  any  efforts  to  file  his  multi-year
delinquent state tax returns until April 30, 2019 – all one year after the OPM interview and
two weeks after the SOR was issued. While the state income tax returns have now been
filed, none of them were timely filed as required by law. The issues regarding the state
income tax returns have not been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.d.: This is a bank-issued credit-card account with a $22,507 credit limit
and an unpaid balance of $21,192 (Item 7, at 1; Item 8, at 6) Applicant admitted that he
is  indebted  to  the  creditor,  but  contended  that  he  has  been  making  agreed-upon
unspecified payments to the creditor since October 2017. (Item 2, at 1; Item 3, at 1) He
failed to submit any documentation, such as a statement from the creditor agreeing to a
repayment plan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts,
to support his contention that he has an agreement and that he is making any payments
to the creditor. In the absence of such documentation, I must conclude that the account
has not been resolved, and is not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.e., 1.n., and 1.q.: These are three student-loan accounts  with unpaid
balances of $5,410, $1,319, and $867 that were assigned to the Government. (Item 7, at
2-3) Applicant admitted that he is indebted to the creditor, but contended that he has been
making  agreed-upon  unspecified  payments  to  the  creditor  on  all  three  accounts  since
October 2018. (Item 2, at 1; Item 3, at 1) He failed to submit any documentation, such as
a statement from the creditor agreeing to a repayment plan, cancelled checks, copies of
money  orders,  a  bank  register,  or  receipts,  to  support  his  contention  that  he  has  an
agreement  and  that  he  is  making  any  payments  to  the  creditor.  However,  while  those
balances and the status of the accounts reported in Applicant’s 2018 credit report are as
alleged in the SOR, Applicant’s 2019 credit report reflects that Applicant “pays account
as agreed.” (Item 6, at 3-4) Accordingly, I conclude that the accounts are in the process
of being resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.f. and 1.s.: This is a bank-issued credit-card account with a high credit
of $5,325 that was charged off in January 2017. The account was sold or transferred to
one collection agent and subsequently sold to another debt purchaser. Applicant’s 2018
credit  report  indicates  that  the  unpaid  balance  was  $5,410,  and  his  2019  credit  report
reflects an unpaid balance of $4,797. (Item 8, at 6; Item 7, at 2; Item 6, at 3) Applicant
admitted that he was indebted to the creditor, erroneously believing that there were two
separate accounts, but contended that he has been making unspecified payments on the
two accounts as agreed since December 2017. (Item 2, at 1-2; Item 3, at 1-2) The current
owner of the account(s) submitted a payment history supporting Applicant’s contention
that  payments  have  been  routinely  been  made  since  December  2017,  initially  starting
with  $30  payments,  and  increasing  over  time  to  $34  payments.  As  of  April  5,  2019,
Applicant  had  made  a  total  of  $443  in  payments  on  the  account.  ((Item  2  (Letter  and
Account Ledger, dated May 2, 2019)) Applicant’s 2019 credit report reflects that his last
payment was made in June 2019. (Item 6, at 3) Accordingly, I conclude that the account(s)
is in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.g.: This is a credit-card account with a $6,250 credit limit and an unpaid
balance of $4,334 that was charged off. (Item 8, at 7; Item 7, at 2) Applicant admitted that
he  was  indebted  to  the  creditor,  but  contended  that  he  had  settled  the  account  for  an
unspecified sum and resolved it in July 2018. (Item 2, at 1; Item 3, at 1)  been making
agreed-upon unspecified payments to the creditor since October 2017. (Item 2, at 1; Item
3,  at 1) He failed  to  submit any  documentation,  such as  a  statement from  the  creditor
agreeing to a repayment plan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register,
or receipts, to support his contention that he had an agreement and that he made any
required payments to the creditor. However, while the status of the account reported in
Applicant’s 2018 credit report are as alleged in the SOR, Applicant’s 2019 credit report
reflects that the account was “paid for less than full balance,” and it was considered “paid
and closed.” (Item 6, at 5) Accordingly, I conclude that the account has been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.h.: This is a bank-issued credit-card account with a $4,000 credit limit.
While Applicant’s 2018 credit report reflects that there was a past-due balance of $4,052
and  an  unspecified  amount  had  been  charged  off,  his  2019  credit  report  reflects  that
$4,277 had been charged off. (Item 7, at 2; Item 6, at 2) was a past-due balance of $4,052
and  an  unspecified  amount  had  been  charged  off,  his  2019  credit  report  reflects  that
$4,277 had been charged off. Applicant admitted that he was indebted to the creditor, but
contended  that  he  has  been  making  unspecified  payments  on  the  account  as  agreed
since November 2017. (Item 2, at 1; Item 3, at 1) The  collection agent for the account
submitted a payment history supporting Applicant’s contention that payments have been
routinely  been  made  since  November  2017,  initially  starting  with  $30  payments,  and
increasing over time to $33 payments. As of April 15, 2019, Applicant had made a total
of $516 in payments on the account. ((Item 2 (Letter and Account Ledger, dated May 2,
2019)) Applicant’s 2019 credit report reflects that his last payment was made in August
2019. (Item 6, at 2) Accordingly, I conclude that the account is in the process of being
resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.i.: This is a bank-issued charge account with a $2,150 credit limit, and
$2,810 charged off and purchased by another lender. (Item 7, at 2; Item 6, at 2; Item 8,
at 5) Applicant admitted that he was indebted to the creditor, but contended that he has
been making unspecified payments on the account as agreed since March 2019. (Item 2,
at  1;  Item  3,  at  1)  The  collection  agent  for  the  account  submitted  a  payment  history
partially supporting Applicant’s contention that payments have been routinely been made,
but the commencement date was in December 2018, with $15 payments. As of April 30,
2019, Applicant had made a total of $75 in payments on the account. ((Item 2 (Letter and
Account Ledger, dated April 30, 2019)) Applicant’s 2019 credit report reflects that his last
payment was made in July 2019. (Item 6, at 3) Accordingly, I conclude that the account
is in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.j. and 1.t.: This is a bank-issued charge account with a $1,900 credit
limit and past-due and unpaid balance of $2,280 that was transferred to or purchased by
another lender. (Item 7, at 4; Item 6, at 7; Item 8, at 9) Applicant admitted that he was
indebted to the creditor, but contended that the two separate listings in the credit reports
and the two separate allegations in the SOR referred to the same account, a contention
that  is  correct.  His  most  recent  statement  claimed  that  he  had  written  to  the  original
creditor to  request  payment  arrangements. (Item  2, at 1-2; Item 3,  at 1-2)  He failed  to
submit a copy of his letter to the creditor requesting a repayment plan. Applicant did not
claim  to  have  made  any  payments  on  the  account  since  it  was  transferred  in  2013.
Accordingly, in the absence of necessary documentation, I conclude that the account has
not been resolved, and is not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.k.: This is a bank-issued credit-card account with a $1,500 credit limit and
a past-due and unpaid balance of $1,941. On an unspecified date, $1,462 was charged
off. (Item 7, at 2; Item 8, at 8; Item 6, at 6) Applicant admitted that he is indebted to the
creditor, but contended that he has been making agreed-upon unspecified payments to
the  creditor  since  February  2018.  (Item  2,  at  1;  Item  3,  at  1)  He  failed  to  submit  any
documentation,  such  as  a  statement  from  the  creditor  agreeing  to  a  repayment  plan,
cancelled  checks,  copies  of  money  orders,  a  bank  register,  or  receipts,  to  support  his
contention that he has an agreement and that he is making any payments to the creditor.
In the absence of such documentation, I must conclude that the account has not been
resolved, and is not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.l.: This is a bank-issued charge account with a $1,600 credit limit and a
past-due and unpaid balance of $1,814 that was charged off. (Item 8, at 5; Item 6, at 4)
Applicant admitted that he was indebted to the creditor, but contended that he had settled
the account for an unspecified sum and resolved it in March 2019. (Item 2, at 2; Item 3,
at 1) On April 30, 2019, the collection agent for the account submitted a statement that
the  account  had  been  resolved  and  closed.  ((Item  2  (Letter,  dated  April  30,  2019))
Applicant’s 2019 credit report notes that the account was paid for less than full balance
in March 2019 – before the SOR was issued. (Item 6, at 4) The letter from the creditor
was attached to Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. The account has been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.m.: This is a bank-issued credit-card account with a $1,000 credit limit
and a past-due and unpaid balance of $1,355. On an unspecified date, an unspecified
amount  was  charged  off.  (Item  7,  at  2)  Applicant  admitted  that  he  is  indebted  to  the
creditor, but contended that he has been making agreed-upon unspecified payments to
the  creditor  since  May  2019.  (Item  2,  at  2;  Item  3,  at  1)  He  failed  to  submit  any
documentation,  such  as  a  statement  from  the  creditor  agreeing  to  a  repayment  plan,
cancelled  checks,  copies  of  money  orders,  a  bank  register,  or  receipts,  to  support  his
contention that he has an agreement and that he is making any payments to the creditor.
In the absence of such documentation, I must conclude that the account has not been
resolved, and is not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.o. and 1.r.: This is a bank-issued charge account with a $1,160 credit
limit and an unpaid balance of $1,074. In February 2017, $1,112 was charged off.  The
account was transferred to or purchased by another lender. (Item 7, at 2-3; Item 6, at 7;
Item 8, at 5, 11) Applicant admitted that he was indebted to the creditor, but contended
that the two separate listings in the credit reports and the two separate allegations in the
SOR referred to the same account, a contention that is correct. His most recent statement
claimed that he had made unspecified payment arrangements with the original creditor
with the initial payment made in May 2019. (Item 2, at 2; Item 3, at 2) He failed to submit
any documentation, such as a statement from the creditor agreeing to a repayment plan,
cancelled  checks,  copies  of  money  orders,  a  bank  register,  or  receipts,  to  support  his
contention that he has an agreement and that he is making any payments to the creditor.
In the absence of such documentation, I must conclude that the account has not been
resolved, and is not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.p.: This is a bank-issued credit-card account with a $2,000 credit limit and
a past-due and unpaid balance of $919. On an unspecified date, $2,119 was charged off.
(Item 7, at 3; Item 6, at 4) Applicant admitted that he was indebted to the creditor, but
contended  that  he  had  settled  the  account  for  an  unspecified  sum  and  resolved  it  in
February 2019. (Item 2, at 2; Item 3, at 1) He failed to submit any documentation, such
as a statement from the creditor agreeing to a repayment plan, cancelled checks, copies
of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support his contention that he had an
agreement and that he made any payments to the creditor. Applicant’s 2019 credit report
notes that the account was paid off in February 2019 – before the SOR was issued. (Item
6, at 4) The account has been resolved.
Applicant’s  income  has  been  relatively  modest  over  the  years.  According  to  his
federal income tax forms or the IRS Account Transcripts he furnished, his approximate
adjusted  gross  income  has  been  as  follows:  2010:  $31,000;  2011:  $33,000;  2012:
$34,000; 2013: $36,000; 2014: $36,000; 2015: $28,000; 2016: $39,000; 2017: $21,000;
and 2018: $51,000. It is not known what Applicant’s current financial resources may be
because he did not report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any
monthly remainder that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is
no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of
additional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in
a better position financially than he had been.
