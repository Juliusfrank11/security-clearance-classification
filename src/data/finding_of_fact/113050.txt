Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j. She
denied the allegations SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.g, and 1.h. Her admissions are incorporated into
these findings.
Applicant  is  42  years old  and  married.  She  and  her husband  have  three  young
children. She earned a bachelor’s degree in 1999 and a master’s degree in 2004. In 2005,
she obtained a secret security clearance while working for a defense contractor. She has
worked for her current employer since August 2015. In November 2017, she submitted a
security clearance application (SCA) for a top-secret security clearance. She worked from
October 2005 to sometime in 2014 for the other defense contractor and was then laid off
between 2014 and 2015 for six months. (Tr. 7-8, 23-25, 28-29; GE 1, GE 5)
Applicant  started  having  financial  problems  in  2007,  after  she  and  her  husband
purchased a condominium. She stated that the housing market crisis between 2007 and
2008 negatively affected their motivation to pay the mortgage payments, as the mortgage
balance was higher than the value of the property. They lived there until 2011, when they
moved into her parents’ home. In March 2013, the mortgagor started foreclosing on the
property. In April 2014, the court entered a final foreclosure order. (Tr. 28, 30-31; GE 1,
GE 6) They purchased another home in 2015. (Tr. 51)
After  submitting  her  November  17,  2017  SCA,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a
government investigator on February 21, 2018. During the interview, Applicant discussed
her delinquent debts, including her student loans, the debts subsequently alleged in the
February 22, 2019 SOR. (GE 5)
Based on credit bureau reports (CBR) from August 2018 and May 2019, the SOR
alleged nine debts that became delinquent between 2012 and 2017, and totaled $39,480.
(GE 4, GE 5) The status of each debt is as follows:
1.  (1.a) Applicant admitted that there was a $19,950 deficiency balance owed on
her  mortgage  when  it  was  foreclosed  in  2013.  However,  she  is  no  longer
responsible for it according to a state’s Department of Housing, which does not
pursue  mortgage  deficiencies  on  defaulted  loans.  Additionally,  the  original
creditor is no longer in business. (Tr. 32-33; GE 6; Answer; AE A) This debt is
resolved.
2.  (1.b) Applicant’s two student loans total over $94,000. She took out the initial
loans in 2005. During her February 2018 interview, she said she had not made
significant  payments  on  the  loans,  but  intended  to  begin  a  payment  plan  in
March 2018. At the time the SOR was filed in February 2019, the accounts had
a past due amount of $3,035. As of April 5, 2019, the loans were in forbearance
until August 27, 2019. That deadline was extended to November 26, 2019, at
which time Applicant agreed to begin monthly payments of $260. (Tr. 33-35;
Answer; GE 4, GE 5; AE B) The last time Applicant made consistent payments
on her student loans was several years ago, though she said she made some
monthly payments of $25 while she was unemployed. (Tr. 54-55) This debt is
not sufficiently resolved or being resolved.
3.  (1.c) In February 2019, Applicant entered into a Consent Judgment with a credit
card creditor. She agreed to begin making bi-monthly payments of $50 on the
delinquent $3,461 credit card debt. She has made seven payments.  Prior to
this  agreement,  she  had  begun  making  payments  of  $25  to  the  creditor  in
October 2018, but then stopped. The creditor filed a lawsuit in November 2018.
(Tr. 35-37; Answer; GE 7; AE C) This debt is being resolved.
4.  (1.d)  This  delinquent  $1,739  debt  is  owed  to  a  jewelry  store  for  a  purchase
Applicant made in 2015. In October 2018, Applicant negotiated a payment plan
with  the  creditor.  She  began  making  monthly  payments  of  $50  in  February
2019,  but  was  unable  to  continue  making  them.  She  subsequently  re-
negotiated the debt and plans to begin monthly payments of $59 in September
2019. (Tr. 36-38; AE D) This debt is not sufficiently resolved.
5.  (1.f) In August 2019, Applicant made a $75 payment on the $343 medical debt,
leaving  a  balance  of  $225.  She  will  make  the  final  payments  at  the  end  of
September 2019 (Tr. 38-40; AE F) This debt is being resolved.
6.  (1.g)  Applicant  disclosed  this  $150  medical  debt  in  her  security  clearance
application  based  on  her  credit  report.  After  investigating  it,  she  has  been
unable to locate a creditor to pay. She said she contacted the medical provider,
who indicated that it did not have any outstanding bill for her. (Tr. 40-41) This
debt is resolved.
7.  (1.h)  Applicant  disclosed  this  $200  medical  debt  in  her  security  clearance
application  based  on  her  credit  report.  After  investigating  it,  she  has  been
unable to locate a creditor to pay, including the medical provider.  (Tr. 41-42)
This debt is resolved.
8.  (1.i) The $840 debt owed to a local government is for unpaid parking tickets.
Applicant tried to establish a repayment plan with the agency, but it does not
do that. She intends to pay it after she completes payments on some of her
established payment plans. (Tr. 42-43) This debt is unresolved.
9.  (1.j)  The  $8,489  judgment  owed  to  a  condominium  association  was  entered
against  Applicant  in  2016,  after  the  property  foreclosure  was  completed.  In
November  2018,  she  began  contacting  the  creditor  for  a  payment  plan  and
subsequently initiated one for resolving the judgment. She documented seven
payments from June 2017 to July 2018, in the amounts of $106 and $282, and
then apparently stopped making them. (GE 2) In March 2019, she entered into
another  agreement  to  settle  the  judgment  (now  $9,624)  through  monthly
payments of $535, beginning in April 2019. She presented evidence that she
made  the  full  payments  in  April,  May,  and  June  2019;  she  made  partial
payments  of  $267  in  July  and  August  2019.  (Tr.  43-47)  This  debt  is  not
sufficiently resolved.
Post-hearing, Applicant submitted a written family budget. She acknowledged that
she and her husband had not been working with one on a monthly basis. She stated that
they recently took a financial workshop at their church. (Tr. 61-62)
According to her budget, Applicant and her husband have a net monthly income
of  approximately  $8,320.  After  paying  monthly  expenses,  they  have  about  $2,000
remaining each month, which should be sufficient for Applicant to make her $260 student
loan  payment  in  November,  as  it  is  not  included  in  the  submitted  budget  that  covers
September  through  December 2019.  Applicant  and  her  husband  earn  about  $145,000
annually, and have done so for the past couple years. (AE H) Applicant’s husband also
has outstanding student loans, though she does not know the amount or payment status.
(Tr. 54)
