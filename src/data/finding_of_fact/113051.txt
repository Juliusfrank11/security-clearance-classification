Applicant is a 38-year-old aircraft electronics technician for a defense contractor,
employed  since  January  2018.  Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  1998  and
completed  some  college  credits.  He  was  previously  married  in  February  2001  and
divorced in May 2014. He has two children from that marriage. He remarried in October
2014, and his spouse has eight children from her previous marriage. One of his children
lives with him, and one child lives with his former spouse to which he pays child support.
He served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from 2001 until 2014. He was
discharged  in  April  2016  with  a  general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions.  He
remained unemployed from April to August 2016 after being discharged from active duty.
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  has  over  $35,000  in  delinquent  debts,  and  that  he
failed  to  file  his  2016  federal  income  tax  return  when  due.  Applicant  admitted  the
allegations  with  the  exception  of  a  small  medical  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.f).  He  provided
explanations in his Answer to the SOR.
Applicant failed to file his 2016 federal income tax return because he claimed that
he was unable to access his W-2 form from his military employer. (SOR ¶ 1.m) He claimed
he  could  not  access  his  online  pay  account  after  he  was  discharged  from  the  Marine
Corps in 2016, and so was unable to file his tax return. Applicant submitted into evidence,
an unsigned 2016 Form 1040A federal income tax return after obtaining his W-2 from the
Defense  Finance  and  Accounting  Service  (DFAS)  in  2019,  and  he  claimed  that  he
submitted  the  return  two  weeks  before  his  hearing  in  this  case.  Department  Counsel
objected to admission of the tax return because it was undated and unsigned, and there
was no documentary evidence showing that it was filed with the IRS. At the hearing, I
discussed with Applicant the importance of providing documentary evidence that the tax
return was actually filed, however no such evidence was submitted in his post-hearing
submission.
Three of  the  largest  SOR  debts  are  collection  or  charged-off  accounts  owed on
various  credit  cards  and  a  car  loan,  totaling  over  $33,000.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  b,  c,  and  g)
Applicant testified that he stopped payments on a car loan identified in SOR ¶ 1.a, in June
2016, although his credit report shows it was June 2017. The account was charged off in
January  2018  for  $18,147.  The  car  was  not  repossessed,  and  Applicant  still  has  the
vehicle. He stated that he tried to make payment arrangements in 2018, and paid $3,269
as the first of four installments toward the debt, but he did not have the money to continue
payments  under  the  plan.  In  a  post-hearing  submission,  Applicant  stated  that  he
contacted the creditor but he could not settle the account but he could continue to make
payments. No evidence of a payment plan or continued payments under the old plan was
submitted. This debt remains unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b is a delinquent military retail store credit card account totaling $10,089.
The  account  became  delinquent  in  March  2016,  and  transferred  to  collections.  The
creditor  garnished  Applicant’s  wages  and  intercepted  his  2018  tax  refund.  Applicant’s
September 2019 credit report shows the account remains past-due for $8,813. In his post-
hearing  submission,  Applicant  stated  that  he  agreed  to  make  additional  $250  monthly
payments and provided a preauthorized schedule for $250 monthly payments beginning
in October 2019 and ending in July 2022. Of note, the account numbers on the payment
plan do not correspond to the delinquent account reported on his credit report. This debt
remains unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c is a credit card account for $4,307 that became delinquent in October
2013,  transferred  to  collections,  and  charged  off.  He  testified  that  he  made  no  further
payments since then, and has had no further contact with the creditor. In his post-hearing
submission, Applicant stated that he contacted the creditor and intends to make monthly
payments of $216 going forward. He provided a debit receipt showing a $216 payment to
the creditor on September 17, 2019. No repayment agreement or plan with the creditor
was submitted. This debt remains unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.d is a military base housing account that became delinquent for $1,286
in  April  2016.  The  account  remained  unresolved  until  Applicant  contacted  the  creditor
after the hearing. In his post-hearing submission, Applicant stated that he contacted the
creditor  and  agreed  to  pay  $150  per  month.  He  provided  a  debit  receipt  showing  a
payment  for  $150  on  September  17,  2019.  No  repayment  agreement  or  plan  with  the
creditor was submitted. This debt remains unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.e is a delinquent cable service provider account from 2016, referred to
collection  in  2018,  for  $197.  Applicant  testified  that  he  paid  the  debt,  and  provided  a
document showing a payment of $99 in August 2018. The account no longer appears on
his credit report. This debt is resolved.
Four small medical debts were alleged in the SOR, totaling $390. SOR ¶ 1.f is an
account with an unknown medical creditor. Applicant denied knowledge of the account,
and there is insufficient evidence in the record to confirm the debt. SOR ¶ 1.j is a $134
medical collection by a known collection agent. Applicant is unaware of the account, but
has not contacted the creditor or attempted to resolve it. SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.l are medical
collection accounts that Applicant paid in July 2018, and are resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.g  is  a  bank  credit  card  account  that  became  delinquent  in  2013,  for
$3,746. Applicant has not made a payment  since 2013 on the account, and it remains
unresolved. SOR ¶ 1.h is a delinquent cable service provider account for $857. Applicant
made a $263 payment toward this debt in April 2019, but continues to owe about $602.
He has not provided a plan to resolve this debt. SOR ¶ 1.i is an insurance company debt
for $140 that was referred to collections. Applicant paid $145 to resolve this debt in April
2019.
Applicant’s supervisor and coworker attested to his good work performance and
reliability. They believe he is an honest and respectful leader in the workplace. Applicant
acknowledges the mistakes he has made in the past, and noted his efforts to resolve his
debts.  He  attributes  his  financial  difficulties  to  his  2014  divorce  and  his  2016
unemployment,  and  extra  costs  he  incurs  when  his  child  or  stepchildren  visit.  He  also
testified that he falls behind on paying expenses in the summer because of high utility
costs. He did not provide evidence of financial counseling or professional assistance with
his finances.
