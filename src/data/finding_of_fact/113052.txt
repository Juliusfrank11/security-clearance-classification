Applicant admitted failing to timely file his 2015-2016 Federal income tax returns,
and accumulating over $20,000 delinquent debt (SOR 1.a-1.k). He is a 41-year-old truck
driver  employed  by  a  U.S.  defense  contractor  since  March  2016.  He  was  briefly  un-
employed January-March 2016, but has otherwise been continually employed in similar
positions since December 2005. He has never married and has no children. He has not
previously held a clearance (Item 3).
Applicant  disclosed  SOR  debts  1.a  and  1.i  on  his  March  2016  clearance
application (Item 2). Applicant discussed his failures to file, and all the SOR debts except
SOR  1.c,  during  his  August    2018  interview  with  a  Government  investigator  (Item  4),
based on his April 2016 credit report (Item 5). He attributed his failure to timely file his
Federal income tax returns for the years at issue to being lazy. He stated his intent to file
his delinquent tax returns in April 2019, along with his 2018 income tax return. He also
described the nine delinquent debts on his April 2016 credit report and stated his intent
to investigate the current status of the debts and make arrangements to resolve them.
However, he has neither claimed nor documented any actions taken.
Applicant=s Answer (Item 2) admitted the SOR allegations, but did not otherwise
illuminate his financial situation. Applicant documented no credit or financial counseling,
and did not submit a budget. He provided no work or character references, or evidence
of community involvement.
