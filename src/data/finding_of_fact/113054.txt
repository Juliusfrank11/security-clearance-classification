Applicant,  29,  is  divorced,  and  he  has  one  young  son  from  a  subsequent
relationship. He received a bachelor’s degree in December 2017, and he is currently in
a master’s degree program. Applicant served in  the U.S. Army from August 2010 until
he  was  honorably  discharged  in  August  2016.  Since  September 2019, he  has  worked
as a cyber-security analyst for a defense contractor. (Tr. 9-12)
Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR and amended SOR. (Answer;
Amended SOR; Tr. 15)
Applicant  started  using  marijuana  in  2006,  while  he  was  in  high  school.  He
continued  to  use  marijuana  until  December  2009.  Additionally,  he  used  cocaine  and
used  without  a  prescription  various  medications  in  2009.  In  March  2010,  Applicant
completed  his first  SCA  (2010  SCA),  and  he  did  not  disclose  any  drug  use.  Applicant
testified  that  he  initially  disclosed  his  history  of  drug  use  in  his  2010  SCA.  He  was
advised by his Army recruiter to change his 2010 SCA in order to be eligible to receive
preferred  positions  in  the  Army.  Applicant  did  not  seek  additional  guidance  regarding
this  issue,  nor  did  he  disclose  his  drug  use  during  a  subsequent  interview  with  a
government investigator. (Answer; GE 3 at 38; GE 5 at 8-9; GE 6 at 3; Tr. 20-22)
From  2010  until  2013,  Applicant  did  not  use  marijuana  and  did  not  spend  time
with  people  who  used  marijuana.  In  April  2010  he  received  a  top  secret  sensitive-
compartmentalized information (SCI) security clearance. In June 2013, Applicant drank
too much alcohol and chose to use marijuana with a stranger. Applicant did not report
his  June  2013  drug  use  to  his  command  or  security  manager,  because  he  knew  he
would there would be work-related consequences for using illegal drugs. (GE 4; GE 6 at
2-4; Tr. 23-24)
In  May  2015,  Applicant  completed  a  second  SCA  (2015  SCA).  He  did  not
disclose his 2008 to 2009 and 2013 drug use, because he believed his 2010 SCA and
2015  SCA  should  be  consistent.  During  the  subsequent  subject  interview  with  a
government investigator Applicant did not disclose: his history of drug use; his failure to
disclose his drug use in his two SCAs; and his failure to disclose his drug use during his
2010 subject interview. (Answer; GE 2 at 35-36; GE 5 at 9; Tr. 24-26)
In September 2015, Applicant used marijuana while visiting a former Army friend.
He  did  not  report  this  use  to  his  command  or  security  manager,  because  he  was
concerned  about  the  ramifications  and  repercussions  on  his  career  and  security
clearance. (GE 5; GE 6; Tr. 26, 54)
Applicant completed a third SCA in February 2016 (2016 SCA), and again, he did
not  disclose  his  history  of  drug use.  (This SCA  was  not  offered  into  evidence, but  it  is
referenced in GE 6 at 2.) In June 2016, while still on active duty in the Army, Applicant
applied  for  a  job  with  a  defense  contractor,  who  sponsored  him  for  access  to  SCI.
Applicant  then  underwent  a  polygraph  examination  with  another  government  agency
(AGA). During the pre-examination interview, Applicant disclosed using marijuana every
day  or  every  other  day  from  August  to  December  2009.  He  also  claimed  that  he
unintentionally used marijuana one time in 2014, but this was the full extent of his drug
use.  The  examiner  told  Applicant  he  did  not  pass  the  exam  after  the  first  round  of
questions.  Applicant  then  disclosed  his  use  of  marijuana  while  holding  a  security
clearance in 2013 and 2015. He also disclosed  illegally using cocaine and prescription
drugs  without  a  prescription  in  2009.  In  July  2016,  the  AGA  denied  Applicant  SCI
eligibility. (GE 5 at 9; GE 6; Tr. 27-32, 44-45)
Applicant was discharged from the Army in August 2016, and he received a 70%-
disability  rating  from  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA).  Applicant  started  using
and purchasing marijuana in January 2017 due to chronic pain. He did not want to use
traditional  pain  medication.  From  January  2017  until  March  2017,  he  used  marijuana
every  other  day.  Applicant  stopped  using  marijuana  in  March  2017,  to  focus  on  his
family responsibilities. (GE 5 at 3, 8; Tr. 32-35)
In  August  2017,  Applicant  used  marijuana  one  time  after  his  best  friend
committed suicide in their home. In December 2017, Applicant was offered a position by
defense  contractor,  contingent  upon  him  securing  a  security  clearance.  He  obtained a
medical  marijuana  card  in  January  2018.  He  completed  a  fourth  SCA  in  March  2018
(2018  SCA),  and  he  disclosed  using  marijuana  while  holding  a  security  clearance  in
June 2013 and September 2015. Applicant also indicated that he used marijuana every
other day from early January 2017 to August 2017. (GE 1 at 40-41; GE 5 at 7-8; Tr. 36-
41, 43)
Applicant started using marijuana again in July 2018. He started using marijuana
again,  despite  seeking  a  security  clearance,  because  there  was  no  guarantee  that  he
would  obtain  a  clearance  and  he  was  in  pain.  Additionally,  he  believed  his  use  was
legal.  Applicant  did  not  consult  with  his  sponsor  as  to  whether  medicinal  use  of
marijuana  was  allowed,  because  he  believed  his  marijuana  use  was  legal.  (GE  1;  Tr.
41-45)
In  his  October  2018  subject  interview,  which  he  adopted  in  February  2019,
Applicant  disclosed  that  he  intended  to  continue  to  use  medical  marijuana  until  he
obtained a security clearance. He claimed that that the only drug he had ever misused
was  marijuana,  and  that  he  last  used  marijuana  in  October  2018.  Applicant  stopped
purchasing  marijuana  in  October  2018,  due  to  the  expense.  Applicant’s  last  drug  test
occurred while he was on active duty in the Army. The last time Applicant was around
people who were using marijuana  was during the summer of 2019. While at a friend’s
house, he was offered marijuana, but he did not use it. (GE 5 at 2, 8-9; Tr. 46-47, 50-52)
Applicant  deployed  to  Jordan  and  Afghanistan  while  he  was  on  active  duty.  He
received  two  Army  Commendation  Medals  and  two  Army  Good  Conduct  Medals.
According  to  Applicant,  the  two  nights  Applicant  used  marijuana  while  on  active  duty
were  insignificant,  and  he  does  not  consider  himself  to  be  a  habitual  marijuana  user.
(Tr. 48-50, 52-53)
