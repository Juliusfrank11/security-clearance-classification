1.k-1.m, and 1.o. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  He did not provide any
mitigating documentation relevant to any debts
Applicant  is  30  years  old,  and  he  has  been  employed  as  a  customer  service
representative for a government contractor since September 2016. In 2007, he enlisted
in  the  U.S.  Navy  and  remained  on  active  duty  until  June  2013,  when  he  received  an
honorable discharge. In 2014, Applicant received a welding certification. Between 2011
and 2016, he was married and divorced twice with the same woman. He has two minor
children. (Tr. 14-17, 22-23; GE 1)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s income dropped after he left the U.S. Navy in June 2013. During his
enlistment, he suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI). He was an E-4 at the time of his
discharge,  and  was  permanently  decertified  for  duty  due  to  poor  attitude,  lack  of
motivation and loss of confidence. He currently suffers memory issues from this injury.
Applicant  was  going  through  a  divorce,  working  part-time  for  about  a  year,  and  was
unemployed  for  about  a  year  while  he  attended  school.  He  was  overwhelmed  and
stressed,  and  eventually  voluntarily  admitted  himself  into  a  hospital.  During  this  time
period, Applicant acknowledged that he overlooked his financial obligations. (Tr. 12, 18-
20, 38-44, 47-50; AE A)
Applicant has worked for his employer for about three years, and his monthly net
income  is  approximately  $2,000.  He  also  receives  $800  monthly  from  the  Veterans
Administration for his service disability. His live-in girlfriend baby-sits and receives about
$100  a  week.  Applicant  provided  a  budget  after  the  hearing  that  did  not  include  his
girlfriend’s income. His monthly net income of $2,800 pays all of their monthly expenses,
to include a $250 monthly payment for medical bills, with a zero remainder. (Tr. 12, 18-
20, 38-44, 47-50; AE A)
The  SOR  alleges  fifteen  delinquent  debts  totaling  approximately  $24,000.The
record establishes the status of Applicant’s accounts as follows:
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  a  repossessed  car account  with  a  deficit  balance  of  $5,973.
After Applicant got out of the military, he soon realized that he could no longer afford his
monthly car payments. In late 2013, he called the creditor and asked that they pick up the
car. He called the creditor in 2016 about the debt, but since that time, he has not made
any attempt to pay or resolve this outstanding account. The January 2019 credit report
showed the account as delinquent. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 24-27; GE 2)
SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  1.d,  and  1.f  allege  three  defaulted  student  loans  with  the  U.S.
Department of Education in the total amount of $8,947. Applicant borrowed these funds
for his education in 2013. Applicant stated that after he left school, he was obligated to
make payments on his student loans. He claimed to have made some payments, but his
2018 income tax refund of about $3,000 was involuntarily intercepted to pay toward his
delinquent child support and unpaid student loans. Since then, Applicant has not made
any effort to contact the creditor or establish a payment plan for his delinquent student
loans. The January 2019 credit report showed the account as delinquent. These debts
are not resolved. (Tr. 27-29, 47, 51-52; GE 2)
SOR ¶¶ 1.c, and 1.e allege two delinquent accounts with a credit union that were
referred for collection in the amount of $5,775. He had opened these accounts as a co-
signer for his girlfriend in 2016 or 2017. One account was for a vehicle loan, and the other
account was for a credit card. His girlfriend recently quit her job to start another business
venture that did not succeed. She currently baby-sits to make money, but the income is
insufficient to make payments on these delinquent accounts. Applicant has limited funds
and  cannot  make  payments.  The  January  2019  credit  report  showed  the  account  as
delinquent. These accounts are unresolved. (Tr. 29-32; GE 2)
SOR ¶¶ 1.g-1.i, 1.k-1.m, and 1.o allege medical accounts placed for collection in
the amount of $3,151. Applicant admitted these debts were for medical services provided
to him from a hospital covering different time periods. He is paying the collection agency
$200  a  month  over  a  12-month  period  to  resolve  these  accounts.  At  the  time  of  the
hearing, he had made two $200 payments. He claimed he paid the hospital about $50
each month for his medical services. He was not sure of the remaining balance owed for
the outstanding medical bills. He stated that he would provide documentation during the
30-day period the record was held open. Applicant failed to provide this documentation,
and these debts are unresolved. (Tr. 32-35, 49; GE 2)
SOR  ¶  1.j  alleges  a  delinquent  account  with  a  jeweler  that  was  referred  for
collection  in  the  amount  of  $287.  Applicant  denied  this  debt  in  his  SOR  response.  He
stated that this account stemmed from an engagement ring purchased for his ex-wife. He
disputed the account with the creditor because he believed he paid this account in full.
The  January  2019  credit  report  showed  the  account  as  delinquent.  He  stated  that  he
would  provide  documentation  during  the  30-day  period  the  record  was  held  open.
Applicant failed to provide this documentation, and this debt is unresolved. (Tr. 35-36; GE
2)
SOR  ¶  1.n  alleges  a  delinquent  account  with  a  cellular  company  referred  for
collection in the amount of $150. Applicant denied this debt in his SOR response because
he said he paid it and disputed this debt with the creditor. The January 2019 credit report
showed the account as delinquent. Applicant failed to provide supporting documentation,
and this debt is unresolved. (Tr. 36-38; GE 2)
Applicant  has  not  sought  the  assistance  of  a  financial  counseling  program  to
resolve his indebtedness. His intention is to pay off his outstanding medical debts first,
and  then  start  paying  the  delinquent  credit  union  accounts.  He  provided  a  letter  of
recommendation  from  his  manager  stating  that  Applicant  is  an  exceptional  employee,
who gives maximum effort to support his customers. (Tr. 45; AE B)
