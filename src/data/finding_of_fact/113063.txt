Unless  otherwise  indicated  by  citation  to  another  part  of  the  record ,  I  have
extracted the below find ings of fact from Applicant's SOR answer (Item 3) and SCA (Item
4).
Applicant, age 18, is unmarried without chi ldren.  He graduated high school in June
2018.  He attended  college  part time  between  July 2017  and  September 2018, and  has
been  attending  full  time  since  September  2018.  He  has  been  employed  by  a  federal
contractor as  a cyber-security  trainee  since July 2018.  This  is  his first application  for a
security clearance.
The  SOR  alleged  the  following  under Guideline  J:  "You  consume  alcohol  other
than that provided  by a parent, and other than that at a parent's residence, in violation  of
[state  law]."  In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  the  allegation .  Because  the
Government  did  not  specify  a  citation  or  provide  documents  referencing  the  state  law
alleged,  I  sua  sponte  confirmed  that,  while  there  is  a  criminal  code  section  under
applicable state law prohibiting  underage consumption  of alcohol as alleged  in  the  SOR,
violation  of that section  is a civil  offense, not a crime.  (§ 10-114 and§ 10-119).
The  SOR  alleged,  under  Guideline  H,  that  Applicant  "used  and  purchased
marijuana  with  varying  frequency,  from  about  2014  to  about  June  2018."  Applicant
admitted the allegation, with the following comment:
These  uses are  past  occurrences and  will  not  happen  again.  Some  even
date  back to freshman  year of  high  school, when  one  can  be  very easily
influenced. I believe that I have changed and matured since, and these past
uses would  not affect my current ability to be trusted.

During his October 2018 interview with a DOD authorized investigator concerning
his SCA, Applicant expounded on the facts and circumstances underlying his illegal drug
use and activity. He reiterated his intent not to use any illegal drugs in the future. He has
never had any drug treatment or counseling. (Item 5).
Applicant  smoked  marijuana  once  every  ten  days  after  his  first  usage  in  2014.
From 2014 through 2016, he smoked it once every week. He smoked it at either his home
or a  friend’s home.  He  purchased approximately two  to  three  grams  of  marijuana at a
time. After his father smelled marijuana emanating from Applicant’s room, he abstained
from  using  marijuana  during  a  five  month  period  not  specified  in  the  record.  He  then
resumed weekly usage until the week before he started his current position with a federal
contractor. I will consider the illegal drug use and activity not alleged in the SOR only for
the purpose of evaluating mitigation and the whole person. (Item 5).
