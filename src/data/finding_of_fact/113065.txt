In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  denied  all  the  allegations.  After  a  review  of  the
pleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He began working
at  his  present  job  in  May  2016.  He  is  a  senior  information  systems  (IT)  storage
consultant. He experienced unemployment from March 2016 until May 2016. He worked
for  various  private  sector  employers  from  July  2010  to  March  2016  providing  IT
services. He has a bachelor’s degree. He is single, never married and has a four-year-
old child, for whom he pays child support. (Tr. 8-9, 21-22; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  three  delinquent  debts  (a  consumer  debt,  child  support
arreage,  and  a  lodging  debt)  totaling  approximately  $57,204.  The  debts  were  listed  in
credit reports from August 2016, August 2017, February 2019, and May 2019 (SOR ¶¶
1.a – 1.c). (AE 4-6)
Applicant  pointed  out  that  he  is  a  good  citizen  who  pays  his  taxes  and  has  no
criminal  history.  He  also  has  family  members  who  served  in  the  military.  Applicant’s
child support debt arose because he disputed  that the state child support enforcement
division  could  require  him  to  pay  child  support  without  a  judge’s  order.  He  does  not
dispute that the child is his. The consumer debt of approximately $25,000 was incurred
in 2016, when Applicant received a loan after he purchased his home in the state where
he was living at the time. After he lost his job he defaulted on the loan. The final debt
was for a contracted living arrangement that Applicant was in when he moved to a new
state.  He  moved  out  early  because  the  noise  was  too  much  for  him  to  handle  and
management did not respond to his numerous complaints. The Government conceded
this may be a case of constructive eviction. SOR ¶ 1(c) is resolved for Applicant. (Tr. 22-
24, 38-40; GE 2)
The status of the remaining SOR debts is as follows:
Consumer  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  This  debt  went  delinquent  in  August  2016.
Applicant  told  a  defense  investigator  in  July  2018  that  he  would  call  the  creditor  and
start  making  payments  on  the  account.  There  is  no  documentary  evidence  to  support
that Applicant took any action at that time. Applicant admitted this debt in his testimony.
He stated that he had no communication with the creditor for the past 18 months. Post-
hearing  (June  2019),  Applicant  documented  that  he  contacted  the  collection  agency
servicing this debt. He was offered two payment options. He failed to produce evidence
that  he  accepted  either  of  the  proposed  options.  Applicant  also  indicated  that  he
received proceeds of approximately $65,000 from the sale of his home in another state.
He  used the proceeds  to  pay  his child  support  arreage  and  buy  some  land  in  another
state for investment  purposes.  He  did not apply  any  of  the  proceeds  toward  this debt.
This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 23-25, 35; GE 2, 4; AE A, C)
Child Support (SOR ¶ 1.b). Applicant documented that he paid his child support
arreage  in  March  2019.  He  also  documented  that  his  ongoing  support  payments  are
being deducted from his paycheck in the amount of $678 every two weeks. The debt is
resolved. (Tr. 26-27; Answer (attachments); AE A-B)
Applicant  did  not  produce  a  budget  and  there  is  no  evidence  that  he  sought
financial counseling.
