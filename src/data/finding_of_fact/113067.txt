Applicant, age 52, is married without children. He earned his high school diploma
in 1985. He has been employed by a defense contractor as an aircraft mechanic since
2007. This is his first application for a security clearance. (Item 3)
Applicant failed to timely file, as required, his federal and state income tax returns
for tax years 2015 through 2017. He did not timely file them because he did not believe
he had any obligation to do so if he was owed refunds, which he expected from the IRS
and  the  state  for  each  of  those  years.  In  his  SOR  answer,  he  acknowledged  that  his
belief was “erroneous.” (Item 2)
Applicant  reported  the  derogatory  information  about  his  tax  return  filings  on  his
July  2018  SCA  and  promised  to  file  all  of  his  delinquent  returns  by  the  end  of  August
2018. He filed all three federal returns by certified mail on February 19, 2019. He filed
his state returns electronically, on February 12, 2019, for tax years 2015 and 2016, and
on  February  13,  2019,  for  tax  years  2017  and  2018.  The  status  of  his  2018  federal
return  was  not  addressed  in  the  record.  The  expected  refunds  for  tax  years  2015
through 2017 totaled $20,918 from the IRS, and $2,906 from the state. (Item 3 at 31-32;
AE A, B)
