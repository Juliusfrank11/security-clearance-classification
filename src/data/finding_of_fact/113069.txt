Applicant  is  a  60-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance, although he has held a clearance in the past. He is employed as a contracts
manager  for  a  large  company  in  the  defense  industry.  His  annual  salary  is  about
$140,000,  the  highest  it’s  been  for  some  time.  He  has  been  so  employed  since
February  2019.  His  educational  background  includes  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  business
administration.  He has  been married  since 1984.  His  employment history  includes:  (1)
full-time  subcontracts  specialist  for  a  defense  contractor  from  November  2017  to
February  2019;  (2)  full-time  flatbed  truck  driver  from  September  2017  to  November
2017; (3) full-time self-employment as a consultant from December 2013 to September
2017;  (4)  full-time  senior  subcontracts  manager    for  a  defense  contractor  from
December  2011  to  November  2013,  with  duty  in  Afghanistan;  and  (5)  full-time  self-
employment  as  owner  and  operator  of  a  franchise  restaurant  business  from  October
2001 to November 2011.
The  SOR  concerns a history  of financial  problems that  related  to a  downturn  in
business and eventual failure of Applicant’s business. Beginning in 2001, Applicant and
his spouse purchased their first franchise and over a period of years built the business
to  three  or four separate  restaurants  in  the local community.  At  its  peak, the business
had  about  135  employees,  mostly  college  students,  and  Applicant  stated  they  had  a
good business with a good reputation. (Tr. 39) The business was hit hard in 2008 by the
recession and resulting downturn in discretionary spending and in the overall economy.
(Tr. 38-40) At the time, Applicant and his spouse thought they had sufficient financing to
operate the business for 12 to 18 months, which they thought would carry them through
a short-term, regular recession. They took remedial actions, including taking a $165,000
line of credit secured by their home and closed one of the restaurants. (Tr. 40) By 2009,
it  was  evident  that  the  business  was  struggling.  (Tr.  40-41)  The  business  had  one
restaurant with about 45 employees at the time of sale in 2011. (Tr. 41-42)
The  franchisor  found  a  buyer,  a  person  already  in  the  restaurant  business,  for
Applicant, and the business was sold in December 2011. (Tr. 42, Exhibits B, G, H, and
I) Applicant acted as the lender in the transaction, making a short-term loan of $16,000
payable within ten days in December 2011, and making a balloon-payment promissory
note for $64,000 with $1,000 monthly installments for a period of about two years during
2012-2014, and a balloon payment due on January 1, 2014. The buyer timely paid the
short-term loan of $16,000, but defaulted on the promissory note, as his business failed
and the buyer was seeking relief in bankruptcy. (Exhibit J)
After  selling  the  business,  Applicant  obtained  employment  as  a  full-time  senior
subcontracts  manager  for  a  defense  contractor.  He  lived  and  worked  in  Afghanistan
from  December  2011  to  November  2013,  when  he  elected  to  return  due  to  his  wife
having serious health problems. He has since continued to work full-time in an effort to
recover from and address his financial problems, although his employment history was
a bit uneven without a steady, good-paying job like he has now.
Applicant  incurred  tax  indebtedness  with  both  state  and  federal  tax  authorities
when  his  business  did  not  make  sufficient  withholding  and  then  forward  the  payroll
taxes withheld of behalf of employees. (Tr. 58-59) Such cases are often referred to as
100%  penalty  assessment  cases,  the  penalty  is  civil  not  criminal,  and  it  is  sometimes
called the Civil Penalty (or “CIV-PEN”). In 2012, the IRS filed a notice of federal tax lien
against Applicant’s spouse in the total amount of $49,811 for six tax periods (quarters)
during 2009-2010. (Exhibit 3) In 2014, the IRS filed a notice of federal tax lien against
Applicant’s  spouse  in  the  total  amount  of  $16,208  for  three  tax  periods  (quarters)  in
2011. (Exhibit 4) He does not owe the IRS for the most recent tax years of 2014-2018.
(Exhibit D) The state tax authority also filed two tax liens against Applicant or his spouse
or both in amounts of $1,935 and $1,042.
Applicant  was  in  and  out  of  bankruptcy  court  during  2016-2018.  (Tr.  45-50;
Exhibits 5-7) He filed two Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases in 2016 and 2017, respectively,
in  an  effort to  reorganize  his finances,  pay  off  his creditors per a  court-approved  plan,
and prevent foreclosure  of his residence.  In both  cases,  Applicant elected  to have  the
cases dismissed before starting the payment plans due to circumstances at the time. By
2018,  Applicant  and  his  spouse  concluded  that  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  case  was  the
best  course  of  action.  The  petition  was  filed  in  February  2018  and  a  discharge  was
granted by the bankruptcy court in June 2018. They reaffirmed the debt stemming from
the  line  of  credit  secured  by  their  house,  but  their  other  debts  were  discharged.  Their
liabilities  included  $72,650  in  priority  unsecured  claims  and  $101,531  in  nonpriority
unsecured debts. (Exhibit 7) After the bankruptcy was completed, they lost the home in
foreclosure in about October 2018. (Tr. 46-48)
Applicant  stated  that  he  has  made  payments  to  both  the  state  and  federal  tax
authorities over the last several years. He did not present any documentation of a purely
voluntary  payment  (e.g.,  check,  money  order,  etc.).  In  May  2019,  the  IRS  applied
$7,935  of  Applicant’s  2018  income  tax  refund  to  the  tax  period  ending  September 30,
2009. (Exhibit K at 3). In June 2019, the state tax authority sent his 2018 state income
tax  refund  of  $4,035  to  the  IRS.  (Exhibit  K  at  2)  In  September  2019,  the  state  tax
authority  acknowledged  receipt  of  funds  that  were  sufficient  to  pay  in  the  full  the  tax
liability, and indicated that the two state tax liens were in the process of being released.
(Exhibit K at 4) Accordingly, I specifically find the state tax liens are paid and resolved.
Applicant contacted the IRS in July 2019, which was about four months after the
SOR was issued to him. (Exhibit C) The IRS accepted his proposal to pay the amount
he owes, which was $66,514 including penalty and interest,  by November 7, 2019. He
explained at the hearing that he intended to make a lump-sum payment to resolve the
tax  indebtedness  with  the  IRS  by  using  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  a  parcel  of  land.
(Exhibits  E  and  F)  The  parcel of  land,  which  is  mountain  property,  is  a  five-and-a-half
acre corner lot with a market value of about $125,000 to $150,000, and he intends to list
it  at  $100,000  to  promote  a  quick  sale.  (Tr.  59-60)  Selling  the  land  has  been  delayed
due to various circumstances largely beyond his control (e.g., road closure and state fire
ban) (Tr. 53-54) As a result, as of December 1, 2019, the land was unsold, and the tax
debt with the IRS remained unresolved, although it appears the IRS is working with him
so he can remain current. (Exhibit K at 1 and Exhibit L). Accordingly, I specifically find
the federal tax liens are unpaid and not released.
Applicant  described  the  loss  of  business  and  his  home  as  very  humbling  and
sobering  events.  (Tr. 74)  As  a  result,  he  believes  he  will  not  make  similar  mistakes  in
the future.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
1  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S.  518,  528  (1988)  (“it  should  be  obvious  that  no  one  has  a
‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no
right to a security clearance).
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.6
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
2 484 U.S. at 531.
3 484 U.S. at 531.

5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).
6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶¶ E3.1.14 and E3.1.15.
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;
AG ¶ 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local
income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income
tax as required;
AG  ¶  20(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  a  death,  divorce,  or
separation,  clear  victimization  by  predatory  lending  practices,  or  identity
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
AG ¶ 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax
authority  to  file  or  pay  the  amount  owed  and  is  in  compliance  with  those
arrangements.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The Chapter 7
bankruptcy  in  2018  discharged  a  sizeable  amount  of  unsecured  debt,  and  the  tax
indebtedness  with  the  state  and  federal  tax  authorities  are  long-standing  matters.  The
disqualifying  conditions  noted  above  apply  to  this  case  except  for  the  disqualifying
condition at AG ¶ 19(f), because it concerns matters limited to income tax, which are not
part of this case.
levels.  The  business  downturn  and  eventual  business
Applicant  is  certainly  not  the  only  person  to  experience  serious  financial
difficulties  due  to  the  so-called  Great  Recession,  which  in  the  United  States  was  a
severe financial crisis combined with a deep recession that occurred during 2007-2009.
Even after the recession ended, it took many years for the economy to recover to pre-
crisis
failure  Applicant
experienced were clearly circumstances largely beyond his control. The same goes for
the  health  problems  experienced  by  Applicant’s  spouse  and  Applicant’s  uneven
employment  history  since  the  business  failure.  Frankly,  a  bankruptcy  to  resolve  the
indebtedness  connected  to  or  associated  with  Applicant’s  business  seems  like  a
reasonable approach given the financial difficulties he faced. Accordingly, the mitigating
condition  at  AG  ¶  20(b)  applies,  in  part,  to  the  three  bankruptcy  cases  during  2016-
2018, as they were closely connected to the business failure. I did not apply AG ¶ 20(b)
to the IRS tax problems for the reasons discussed below.
In addressing mitigation, I note that an applicant’s failure to comply with tax laws
bears close examination and is a matter of serious concern to the federal government.
The  DOHA  Appeal  Board  has  made  it  clear  that  an  applicant  who  fails  repeatedly  to
fulfill their legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying tax when due, does not
demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted
access to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 15-06707 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15,
2017).
Here,  I  am  concerned  about  the  duration  of  Applicant’s  tax  problems  and  the
timing  of  his  remedial  action,  especially  the  amount  owed  to  the  IRS  since  it  is  much
larger than the amount owed to the state tax authority. With that said, the two state tax
liens  were  for  less  than  $2,000  each,  and  they  are  paid  in  full.  Accordingly,  those
matters are decided for Applicant.
The  IRS  filed  the  tax  liens  against  Applicant  in  2012  and  2014,  which  is  now
several years ago. There is no documentary evidence of voluntary payments to the IRS.
The most recent payments to the IRS were interceptions of income tax refunds for tax
year 2018. Applicant’s plan to make a lump-sum payment to the IRS was proposed and
agreed to in July 2019, after he received the SOR in this case. The plan is reasonable,
but it has been delayed due to difficulties in getting the land ready to sell. One wonders
why Applicant did not make an effort to sell the land sooner, years ago, to resolve  the
IRS matters. Considering the totality of facts and circumstances, it is too soon to tell if
Applicant will resolve the two federal tax liens and then continue to continue to meet his
tax  obligations  on  a  timely  basis.  Accordingly,  the  mitigating  condition  at  AG  ¶  20(g)
applies  in part because  he has made an  arrangement  with  the  IRS.  Nevertheless,  the
evidence  is  not  sufficient  to  mitigate  his  long-standing  and unresolved  tax  liens due  to
the  civil  penalty.  His  tax  problems  with  the  IRS  have  gone  on  for  too  many  years  to
justify complete mitigation under AG ¶ 20(b).
Following Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to  protect
classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence
as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he
has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with
the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:
Subparagraphs 1.a -- 1.c:
Subparagraphs 1.d -- 1.f:
Subparagraphs 1.g -- 1.h:
Against Applicant
For Applicant
Against Applicant
For Applicant
Conclusion
It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for
access to classified information. Eligibility denied.
