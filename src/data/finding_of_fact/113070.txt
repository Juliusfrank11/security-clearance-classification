The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the March 6, 2019 SOR, Applicant
owed delinquent debts totaling $41,684 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.q) on 17 accounts. In a detailed
response, Applicant admitted the debts, but indicated that, in some cases, he did not have
any “objective quality evidence” showing that he had opened the accounts. He explained
that his spouse had been known to open accounts under his name and not inform him. He
detailed circumstances that he believes mitigate several of the delinquencies. With respect
to some debts, he explained that before he received the SOR, he believed charged-off
debts or debts dropped from his credit report were “no longer a concern.” After considering
the pleadings, exhibits, and transcripts, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 36 years old, married, and the father of three children, ages 16, 13, and
12.  He  also  has  two  stepchildren,  ages  21  and  19.  A  high  school  graduate  with  an
associate’s degree  earned  in  2013,  he  enlisted  in  the  United  States military  after high
school in June 2000. He served honorably until he was discharged for medical reasons in
March 2011. He held a top secret security clearance throughout his time in the military. He
was married to his first wife from September 2001 to August 2005. Since 2004 or 2005
Applicant has been paying child support of $152 a week for his son from his first marriage.
(GE 1; AEs A, M; Tr. 27, 33-34.) Applicant and his current spouse wed in July 2007. (GE
1.) They were separated from 2011 to August 2012, reconciled, and have been separated
since June 2019. (Tr. 29.)
In April 2011, Applicant moved for his employment as an engineering technician with
a  semiconductor  company.  By  mid-2013,  his  spouse  was  working  as  a  vendor  for  a
greeting card company. She wanted a vehicle with functioning air conditioning. In June
2013, they purchased a sedan, obtaining a car loan of $27,600 (SOR ¶ 1.b), to be repaid at
$506 per month. In July 2013, they then purchased a 2007 model-year truck, financed for
$20,001.  The  amount  of  their  monthly  truck  payment  is  not  in  the  record.  His  spouse
reduced  her  work  hours  to  return  to  school.  With  the  loss  of  spousal income  and  two
vehicle payments, they began to struggle financially. They stopped paying on the car loan,
and  it  was  charged  off  for  $25,797  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  in  May  2014.  The  vehicle  was
repossessed. (GEs 1-4; AEs A, F, AA-BB.)
After Applicant’s spouse had an accident in their truck, they traded it in for a new car
in August 2015, obtaining a loan for $33,236 (SOR ¶ 1.a). Both Applicant and his spouse
were employed, and so they thought they could afford the $763 monthly payments on their
new loan while continuing to make their payments on the truck acquired only two years
prior. They paid off the loan for the truck in October 2015, but they continued to struggle
financially. Applicant attributes his financial problems at that time to a temporary loss of
spousal income when his wife stopped working because of injury sustained in her vehicle
accident. (GEs 3-4; AEs A, M, Z; Tr. 35, 46.) Applicant provided no details about the loss of
spousal income or the dates of her unemployment.
In  January  2016,  Applicant  accepted  a  job  offer  that  was  contingent  on  him
obtaining  a  security  clearance.  (GEs  3-4;  AE  A.)  On  January  25,  2016,  Applicant
completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions
(SF 86). He responded affirmatively to a financial record inquiry concerning whether he had
any voluntary or involuntary repossessions or foreclosures in the last seven years and
listed two vehicle repossessions: a car owned during his first marriage that was his ex-
wife’s responsibility, and the vehicle repossessed in 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.b). He indicated that
the deficiency balance on that loan was charged off. Applicant also answered “Yes” to
inquiries concerning whether he had any bills or debts turned over to a collection agency in
the past seven years; whether he had any account or credit card suspended, charged off,
or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed in the past seven years; and whether he had been
over 120 days delinquent on any debt in the past seven years. He related that about 15
accounts  totaling  $5,000  in  debt  became  negative  between  2005  and  2013  while  he
transitioned from the military to civilian life, and because he and his wife were separated
from 2011 to 2012. He stated that he was paying his bills “for the most part,” that his credit
score increased by about 30 points in the last six months, and that most if not all of the
past-due debts had been charged off. (GE 1.)
By March 2016, several debts in Applicant’s name or held jointly with his spouse had
been charged off or were in collection. (GE 3.) In early April 2016, Applicant purchased a
2009 model-year truck, taking on a vehicle loan for $12,044 (SOR ¶ 1.c) that required
repayment at $460 per month. He “needed” a truck capable of towing a 26-foot camper
trailer and a 16-foot car hauler that he already owned. He was moving and “needed the car
hauler to move stuff with.” (Tr. 41.) He was consistently two months late in his payments for
the truck. (GEs 3-4; AE R.) In August 2016, the job offer pending with his current employer
was  rescinded  for lack  of  a  decision  on  his clearance,  but  he  was  still  working for the
semiconductor company. (AE A.)
In  late  December  2016,  Applicant  was  laid  off  from  his  full-time  job  with  the
semiconductor  company.  He  had  a  job  lined  up  with  his  current  employer  in  the
southeastern United States, which he started in January 2017 at $50,000 per year. (Tr. 28.)
Relocation  for  his  new  job  was  at  his  expense.  He  drained  his  bank  and  retirement
accounts to cover moving expenses and deposits for housing and utilities. (AE A.) While on
an extended temporary-duty assignment from April 2017 to February 2018, Applicant was
interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
on July 3, 2017. He estimated that about 15 of his credit accounts were delinquent, and
explained  that  he  had  wanted  to  pay  the  debts  but  was  unable  to  do  so  due  to  his
“expanding debt-to-income ratio.” He thought he could manage the payments when he
incurred  the  debts,  and  “things  began  to  snowball”  after  a  loss  of  spousal  income.
Applicant acknowledged that food and housing took priority, and he ignored some bills. He
indicated  that  he  and  his  spouse  were  currently  living  within  their  means  because  his
spouse was working. (GE 2.)
In May 2018, Applicant accepted a position at his current work location, which was
more expensive than his previous locale. They were struggling to make their $763 monthly
payments for the sedan purchased in 2015, and they had just arranged for a voluntary
repossession of the vehicle (SOR ¶ 1.a), so they acquired a 2005 model-year van with a
$2,000 down payment and a $6,966 loan, to be repaid at $301 per month. They made their
payments for the van on time and paid off their loan in May 2019. (GE 2; AE U.) Applicant
and  his  spouse  no  longer have  the  van.  He  testified  about  the  van  as  follows:  “It  was
cheaper for [his] daughter, stepdaughter [to] put a down payment on a vehicle and then we
get the van registered and couldn’t drive the van because the cop decided to take the ....”
(Tr. 43-44.) He did not elaborate further as Department  Counsel redirected him to the
debts in the SOR.
Applicant retained the services of a law firm in the summer of 2018 to clean up his
credit  record.  He  wanted  to  purchase  the  home  he  currently  rents.  Some  debts  were
apparently  removed  from  his  credit  record,  but  he  stopped  paying  the  law  firm  for  its
services in September or October 2018. (Tr. 34.) High water and electric utility costs in his
current  area  caused  him  some  financial  strain.  As of late November 2018, Applicant’s
credit score was only 486. (AE I.) In December 2018, with water and electric bills totaling
approximately $926, he put off paying on his truck loan (SOR ¶ 1.c) obtained in 2016 in an
effort to catch up on his water and utility bills (AE A.)
On March 6, 2019, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant, alleging delinquent
debt totaling $41,684, as follows:
Charged-off auto loan for $19,096 (SOR ¶ 1.a)
The joint car loan obtained for $33,236 in August 2015 was $3,959 past due as of
May 2018 when Applicant realized that, under the loan’s repayment terms, he and his
spouse would end up paying $54,936 for a sedan with a sticker price of less than $30,000.
After speaking with his security manager, he sent a letter to the creditor in early May 2018
indicating  that  he  and  his  spouse  was  no  longer  able  to  make  their  $763  monthly
payments. They offered to surrender the vehicle voluntarily with the understanding that
they would be responsible for the difference between the sale price for the car at auction
and  the  balance  of  the  loan.  They  offered  to  pay  $50  a  month  toward  the  deficiency
balance. In June 2018, the lender repossessed the vehicle with $28,886 due ($3,997 past
due) on their loan. After resale, the lender charged off their account for $17,736. As of
February 2019, Applicant and his spouse owed $19,096 on the debt. Applicant thought he
had no further obligation to the creditor because he had paid $19,838 on the loan, and the
creditor gained another $11,000 to $12,000 in the auction sale. Additionally, the debt had
been charged off. Applicant has made no payments on the charged-off balance as of late
September 2019, even though it continues to adversely affect his credit. (GEs 3-4; AEs A,
S-T, Z, AA-BB; Tr. 35-40.)
Charged-off auto loan for $11,972 (SOR ¶ 1.b)
The joint car loan obtained in late June 2013 for $26,700 became $1,019 past due
in April 2014. The lender repossessed the vehicle around August 2014, and charged off
the account for $25,797. After the vehicle was sold, Applicant thought he and his spouse
had no further obligation to the creditor. In 2018, his spouse received a Notice of Debt
Cancellation (1099-C) for $11,973. They included the debt as unearned income on their
2018 income tax return. As of January 2019, the credit bureaus were reporting the debt as
$14,513 paid in settlement. (GEs 1-4; AEs A, Z, AA-BB; Tr. 40-41.)
Vehicle loan past due for $1,254 (SOR ¶ 1.c)
Applicant’s truck loan obtained for $12,044 in late March 2016 was $1,664 past due
as of March 2018. He missed his loan payments in December 2018 and January 2019
because he wanted to catch up on his utility bills. As of February 2019, his loan was 60
days  past  due  for  $1,290  on  a  $3,190  balance.  In  mid-March  2019,  the  truck  was
involuntarily repossessed. A week later, Applicant and his spouse received their income tax
refund for tax year 2018. Applicant paid $2,702 to reinstate the loan and reacquire the
truck. In March 2019, he paid $697 on the loan. As of April 2019, the loan balance was
$560. They paid off the loan in May 2019 and obtained the title to the truck. (GEs 3-4; AEs
A-B, E, G, R, AA-CC; Tr. 29, 43-45.) When Applicant and his spouse separated in June
2019, he gave her the truck. (Tr. 29, 45.)
Credit card charged off for $682 (SOR ¶ 1.d)
As of October 2018,   Equifax was reporting on Applicant’s credit record that a credit
card had been obtained in August 2016 with a $300 credit limit. The account was charged
off in February 2018 for $682 after nonpayment since November 2017. (GEs 3-4; AE A.)
Applicant’s spouse’s credit report shows that the account was opened individually in her
name. (AE Z.) Applicant does not recall opening the account, although he speculated that
his spouse may have opened it. As of September 2018, Trans Union was reporting that
Applicant was an authorized user on the account. (AE AA.) At the hearing, the Government
conceded that Applicant, as an authorized user on the account, is not legally liable for the
debt. (Tr. 31, 46-47.)
Collection debt for $540 (SOR ¶ 1.e)
Applicant’s credit report lists a credit card obtained with a catalog retailer in July
2010 with a $379 credit limit. The account became delinquent in September 2013. In late
March 2014, the creditor closed the account and wrote off a $540 balance. His spouse
opened the credit-card account in his name, apparently without his knowledge. (Tr. 48.)  In
June 2019, the collection entity holding the debt offered to settle it for a lump sum of $324,
or six monthly payments of $72, or $50 per month. (GEs 2-4; AEs A, Q, Z.) There is no
evidence the debt has been paid.
Collection debt for $278 (SOR ¶ 1.f)
A $278 electric-utility debt from January 2017 was placed for collection in April 2018.
As  of  March  2019,  the  debt  was  unpaid.  When  Applicant  and  his  family  relocated  in
January 2017, he had paid his current bill and was unaware that he owed a balance. He
received  a  notice  about  a  balance  in  the  following  months,  but  did  not  believe  it  was
accurate. The account was charged off, and he believed at the time that if a debt was
charged off or no longer listed on his credit report, it was no longer an issue. (GE 4; AEs A,
AA.) Applicant disputes the debt because he believes he had no outstanding obligation
when he moved, although he has not contacted the creditor. (Tr. 49-50.)
Collection debt for $653 (SOR ¶ 1.g)
Applicant purchased a season pass to an amusement park for his family in 2014,
opting to make monthly payments over a year’s time. After six months, they had only gone
to the park one time. He told the creditor that he wanted to cancel the pass, and the cost
for  the  next  six  months  came  due.  He  refused  to  pay  the  balance  for  which  he  is
contractually liable because he felt he had paid enough to cover his family’s single visit. In
April 2015, a $653 past-due balance was placed for collection. (GE 3; AE A; Tr. 50-51, 56.)
He does not intend to pay the debt. (GE 2.)
Charged-off debt for $640 (SOR ¶ 1.h)
A credit-card account opened by Applicant in May 2010 with a $500 credit limit was
charged off for $640 and in collection as of April 2015. Applicant unsuccessfully disputed
the debt in September 2018. He told the OPM investigator that the debt was “collected.”
The debt was still on his credit record as unpaid as of March 2019. (GEs 2-4; AE A; Tr. 51.)
Applicant  believes  he  settled  with  the  creditor  some  time  ago  (AE  A;  Tr.  52),  but  he
presented no documentary proof that it has been settled. (Tr. 52)
Credit-card collection debt for $723 (SOR ¶ 1.i)
Applicant obtained a credit card in March 2010. He stopped paying on the account
in May 2011, and a $675 debt was placed for collection. As of March 2019, the collection
balance was $723. In mid-March 2019, the collection entity offered to settle the debt for
$361 payable in a lump sum by April 30, 2019; in a down payment of $72 by April 30,
2019,  and  then  $289  within  30  days;  or  in  three  installments  of  $120.  (GE  3;  AE  A.)
Applicant indicated during his July 2017 OPM interview that his spouse had used his credit
for online purchases of items for their home. (GE 2.) There is no evidence that Applicant
has made any payments to settle or satisfy the debt.
Collection debt for $764 (SOR ¶ 1.j)
A wireless telephone debt of $764 was placed for collection in July 2014. Applicant
does not recall opening the account, and he disputed the debt in the summer of 2018
through  the  law  firm  retained  to  clean  up  his  credit  report.  (GE  3;  AE  A;  Tr.  53-54.)
Applicant believes that his spouse could have incurred the debt when they were separated,
so sometime between 2011 and August 2012. (Tr. 53.) He presented no documentation to
corroborate that belief, but the debt was not on his credit record as of March 2019. (GE 4.)
Collection debt for $2,603 (SOR ¶ 1.k)
In December 2014, a collection entity acquired a $2,603 debt for collection. As of
March  2016,  the  credit  bureaus  were  reporting  the  debt  as  being  owed  to  a
telecommunications  company.  When  he  answered  the  SOR,  Applicant  did  not  recall
opening the account, and he indicated that he disputed the debt in the summer of 2018.
(GE 3; AE A.) The debt was not on his credit record as of March 2019. (GE 4.)
Charged-off debt for $115 (SOR ¶ 1.l)
A mail-order charge account in Applicant’s name, which was opened in November
2010 and apparently used by his spouse, was charged off in March 2011 for $70. As of
October 2013, the balance on the debt was $115. (GE 3; AEs A, J.) There is no evidence
of any payments to settle or satisfy the debt.
Charged-off debt for $139 (SOR ¶ 1.m)
A charge account opened in Applicant’s name in October 2010, was charged off for
$139. As of October 2013, the account had no activity since March 2011. (GEs 2-3; AE A.)
There is no evidence of any payments to settle or satisfy the debt.
Charged-off debt for $139 (SOR ¶ 1.n)
Applicant’s  spouse  incurred  a  $139  debt  in  his  name.  Applicant  told  the  OPM
investigator that the debt was incurred for magazines, and that his spouse gave his name
for information. As of October 2013, the account was past due $70 on a balance of $139.
(GEs 2-3; AE A.) There is no evidence of any payments on the debt.
Charged-off debt for $1,104 (SOR ¶ 1.o)
In November 2010, Applicant obtained an installment loan of $4,531, to be repaid at
$137 per month, for furniture and a computer. As of October 2014, he owed a collection
balance of $1,104 on the loan. In April 2015, he paid $450 to settle the debt. (GEs 2-3;
AEs A, C; Tr. 54-55.)
Collection debt for $447 (SOR ¶ 1.p)
A credit-card company placed a $300 debt from March 2011 for collection. As of
December 2013, the collection balance was reportedly $447. He first learned about the
debt in October 2017. (Tr. 59-60.) Applicant told the OPM investigator that his spouse had
used  the  credit  card  for  shopping  and  holiday  gifts.  He  admitted  that  he  had  stopped
making payments on the account. (GEs 2-3.) There is no evidence of any payments toward
the delinquent balance.
Collection debt for $535 (SOR ¶ 1.q)
A credit-card account used by Applicant for household goods referred a $300 debt
from February 2011 for collection. As of January 2014, the collection balance was $535.
Applicant surmised in response to the SOR that his spouse may have obtained credit in his
name. However, he told the OPM investigator that he had used the account for common
household goods and that he had defaulted on his payments due to a bad debt-to-income
ratio.  (GEs  2-3;  AE  A.)  There  is  no  evidence  of  any  payments  toward  the  delinquent
balance.
Applicant and his spouse filed joint income tax returns for tax year 2018. According
to their federal return, his spouse was unemployed that year. On total income of $86,839
($73,551 in wages, $1,315 taxable income from retirement/pension assets, and $11,973 in
cancelled debt), they overpaid their federal income taxes by $3,157. (AE A.)
Applicant’s take-home pay from his defense contractor job is $1,717 – $1,737 every
two weeks. (AE V; Tr. 62.) He receives service-connected disability income of $566 per
month.  (AE  W.)  As  of  March  2019,  he  had  nine  open  credit  cards  with  an  aggregate
balance  of  $6,623  with  scheduled  repayments  totaling  $282  monthly.  He  was  making
timely payments of $100 per month on a secured installment loan obtained for $3,174 in
March 2017. As of March 2019, the balance on the loan was $2,148. Some $39,847 in
deferred federal student loans and $17,315 in private student loans were on his credit
record. (GE 4; AEs A, AA; Tr. 66.) In August 2019, he reduced his storage expenses by
about $30 per month. (AE P; Tr. 82.) As of October 2019, Applicant’s monthly expenses
and debt payments totaled approximately $3,378, which included $1,310 for rent, $246 for
cell phones, $599 for his car payment, $99 for Internet service, $220 for electricity, $132 in
storage  space  rentals,  $207  in  insurance  for  two  vehicles,  $29  for  renter’s  insurance,
approximately $330 in credit-card payments, and $100 for a vacuum. (AE Y.) Applicant
was persuaded by his spouse to finance the purchase of a vacuum for $1,800 that he
estimates will end up costing $3,000. He has made payments to reduce the debts to $700.
(Tr. 80.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  has  always  had  financial  issues  because  something
comes up, such as the SOR and his marital separation, just as he begins to “see the light
at the end of the tunnel.” (Tr. 27-28.) He has no savings and about $182 in his checking
account. (Tr. 69.)
When Applicant and his spouse separated in June 2019, she took their camper and
moved with her two daughters and their two children to another state. His spouse currently
lives in the camper. (Tr. 42-43.) His stepdaughter had obtained a truck for $500 down on
which  she  had  been  making  $98  weekly  payments  with  the  intention  of  obtaining  her
driver’s license. (Tr. 83.) His spouse left him with his stepdaughter’s truck, which he traded
in the vehicle for a new car in August 2019, obtaining a loan for $28,000 to be repaid at
$599 per month. (Tr. 64-65, 75-76.) He explained that a new vehicle was his only option
because of his poor credit. With his car payment and other obligations, he has been unable
to  make  payments  on  his  delinquencies.  (Tr.  29-30,  32.)  He  drives  for  ride-hailing
companies for extra income to make his car payment. He sends his spouse at least $200 a
month, covers the cell phone bill, and his spouse’s and children’s medical insurance. Since
his  spouse  left  him,  his  electric  bill  has  declined  to  about  $200  a  month.  (Tr.  72-75.)
Applicant owed $527 in state income taxes for tax year 2018. (Tr. 84.) He paid the debt on
October 7, 2019. (AE X.)
Applicant’s foreman for over a year on a modernization project attests that Applicant
was selected to perform quality-assurance duties in addition to his daily electrical work
because  of  his  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  ensure  safety  was  never  compromised.
Applicant’s  work  ethic  was  impeccable,  and  the  foreman  indicated  that  he  would  take
Applicant  on  any  project  that  he  manages.  (AEs  A,  K.)  A  design-build  specialist  with
Applicant’s current employer, who worked with Applicant on different projects for about
eight  to  ten  months,  attests  that  Applicant  “did  everything  that  was  asked  of  him  and
expected of him.” Applicant to be a team player who is well-respected by his peers. They
currently work on the same project, where Applicant is doing “a great job.” (AEs A, L.)
