Applicant  is  a  33-year-old  mechanic  employed  by  a  federal  contractor  since
November  2015.  He  served  honorably  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Marine  Corps  from
November 2004 until December 2013. He completed a three-month project management
program in December 2014. He married in January 2006 and divorced in December 2012.
He previously held a security clearance while on active duty. (GX 1.)
The  SOR  alleges  three  debts  totaling  $33,679.  The  debts  are  comprised  of  a
$15,711  charged-off personal loan,  a  $9,875  a  charged-off  credit  card,  and  an  $8,093
balance  due  on  a  vehicle-loan  after  repossession.  Applicant  admits  each  of  the
allegations.  The  delinquent  debts  are  reflected  in  Applicant’s  December  2018  and
November 2016 credit bureau reports (CBR) (GX 6; GX 5), and discussed in his personal
subject interview (PSI) summary (GX 4) and e-QIP (GX 3). Applicant’s admissions are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
After  leaving  active  duty,  Applicant  was  unemployed  from  December  2013  until
January  2014.  In  January  2014,  Applicant  began  working  as  an  operator  for  a
manufacturing  company.  At  some  point  between  January  and  May  2014,  he  was
diagnosed  with  testicular  cancer  and began  undergoing  treatments.  He  was  physically
unable to continue working. In May 2014, he moved to another state with his fiancée with
the intention of continuing to recover then finding work and enrolling in school. He was
unemployed from May 2014 until January 2015. Applicant worked as a technician for an
aerospace  company  from  January  2015  until  September  2015,  when  he  moved  to  be
closer  to  his  family.  He  was  unemployed  from  September  2015  until  November  2015,
when he began working for his current employer.
Due  to  his inability  to  work  while  undergoing  cancer treatments, and  the  lasting
impact of his periods of unemployment between 2013 and 2015, Applicant was unable to
sustain his financial obligations. His vehicle was repossessed in November 2014 (SOR ¶
1.c),  and  his  house  was  foreclosed  upon  in  February  2015.  His  credit  card  became
delinquent in March 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.b) and he defaulted on his personal loan in September
2014 (SOR ¶ 1.a). Applicant incurred an additional $4,626 debt that went to collection in
May  2014,  but  that  debt  has  since  been  repaid  through  garnishment.  (GX  5;  GX  1.)
Applicant attempted to consolidate his debts, but was unable to do so. (GX 4.) The SOR
debts remain outstanding.
Applicant’s CBRs show a credit history dating back to 2007, that includes paid off
personal loans, vehicle loans, credit cards, and a line of credit. Applicant has not incurred
any other delinquent accounts since 2014. He is current on all his open accounts. (GX 6.)
