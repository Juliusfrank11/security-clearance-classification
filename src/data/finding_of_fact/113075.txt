Applicant  went  through  protracted  divorce  proceedings  from  2011  until  the
divorce  was  finalized  in  2013.  He  stated  that  he  “was  under tremendous  stress  during
that  time  and  .  .  .  exercise[d]  bad  judgment.”  He  was  arrested  in  October  2013  and
charged  with  driving  under the  influence  (DUI), with  blood  alcohol  level above  .15.  He
pleaded  nolo  contendere  to  the  charge.  He  was  sentenced  to  $1,000  in  fines  plus
additional  court  costs,  50  hours  of  community  service,  and  probation  for one  year.  He
was required to attend a DUI school and a victim awareness program. He completed all
the terms of his probation. (Tr. at 25-26, 34; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-4; AE

Applicant attended outpatient substance abuse counseling from November 2013
through  January  2014.  He  admitted  during  his  intake  assessment  that  he  smoked
marijuana for relief from his chronic pain associated with fibromyalgia. He stated that he
smoked  marijuana  when  he  was  in  college,  but  then  nothing  until  he  turned  50.  He
stated  that  from  age  50  to  52,  he  would  smoke  half  a  joint  for  relief  from  his
fibromyalgia.  Applicant  was  52  years  old  when  he  completed  the  intake  assessment.
His  drug  test  at  admission  tested  positive  for  THC,  the  active  ingredient  in  marijuana.
He successfully completed the last of his 12 sessions at the end of January 2014.  He
was diagnosed at intake and discharge with alcohol abuse and cannabis abuse.  (Tr. at
26, 31-32, 37-40; GE 6; AE A, C)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  July  2016  and  charged  with  DUI,  second  offense.  He
pleaded nolo  contendere  to the  lesser charge  of  reckless driving  involving  alcohol.  He
was sentenced to $919 in fines and court costs, 100 hours of community service, and
probation for one year. He completed all the terms of his probation in October 2018. (Tr.
at 26-27; GE 1-3, 5; AE A, C)
Applicant denies that he was intoxicated when he was arrested in July 2016. He
asserted that he had one drink with dinner five hours before he drove. He attributed his
erratic  driving  to  a  mechanical  problem  with  his  car.  He  refused  to  have  his  breath  or
blood  tested  because  his  previous  attorney  told  him  that  the  tests  are  inaccurate,  and
he should refuse to submit to them if he is ever arrested again for DUI. (Tr. at 26-31, 43-
44; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2; AE A, C)
Applicant  attended  outpatient  substance  abuse  counseling  as  part  of  a  DUI
program  from  October  2016  through  February  2017.  He  admitted  on  his  intake
assessment that he smoked marijuana about 20 times while he was in college. There is
no  mention  of  his  more  recent  use.  He  remained  abstinent  during  the  program.  He
attended  8  individual sessions  and  14  group  sessions.  He  successfully  completed  the
program  with  a  diagnosis  of  alcohol  use  disorder,  mild,  which  was  later  corrected  to
alcohol use disorder in sustained remission. (Tr. at 35-36, 41-42; GE 2, 7; AE A, C)
Applicant  stated  that  he  has  not  used  marijuana  since  before  he  started  his
counseling in November 2013. He asserts that he has learned a costly lesson from his
DUIs,  and  he  has  benefitted  from  his  counseling.  He  assured  that  he  only  drinks
responsibly and that he will never drink and drive again. He signed a statement of intent
to  abstain  from  all  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse,  acknowledging  that  any
future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. (Tr.

The  SOR  alleges  a  $92,288  charged-off  mortgage  loan;  $11,409  in  unpaid
federal income taxes for tax year 2015; and 34 delinquent medical debts with balances
totaling  about  $12,150.  Except  as  addressed  below,  the  allegations  are  established
through credit reports and Applicant’s admissions.
Applicant’s finances were adversely affected by his divorce, a lay-off from his job
in 2014, and a serious medical operation in 2017. As part of his divorce, he was ordered
to refinance the mortgage on his home to remove his ex-wife’s name from the loan or
sell the property, to include a short sale. He was unable to refinance the property, but
the creditor agreed to a short sale, which took place in 2016. There is no evidence that
the  creditor  has  actively  pursued  any  deficiency  on  the  mortgage  loan.  (Tr.  at  23-24;

Applicant’s federal income  tax  liability  for tax  year 2015  was  $37,912,  but  there
was  only  $1,658  withheld  from  his  paycheck.  He  made  payments  totaling  $2,000  in
2016. The IRS withheld $7,424 from his 2016 refund and $8,420 from his 2017 refund.
He  made  payments  totaling  $400  in  2017.  He  paid  $5,969  in  March  2018  and
established a $500 per month installment agreement. He maintained the payments and
the IRS withheld $5,139 from his 2018 refund. In June 2019, the IRS released the tax
lien  it  had  filed  against  him  and  indicated  that  the  taxes  owed  for  tax  year  2015  had
been satisfied. (Tr. at 22; GE 8; AE B, C)
Applicant’s  surgery  in  2017  cost  more  than  $228,000  in  medical  bills.  He
contested  the  amount  of  the  medical  debts  because  his  health  insurance  placed  a
$5,000  limit  on  his  liability.  He  paid  a  number  of  the  medical  debts  and  referred  other
debts to his attorney. He stated that he is willing to pay all the medical debts that are his
responsibility. His finances are otherwise in order. (Tr. at 22-25; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 2, 9, 10; AE A, C)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
March  2018.  He  reported  his  two  DUI  arrests;  his  substance  abuse  counseling;  and  a
$9,045  delinquent  medical  debt.  He  answered  “No”  to  the  question  that  asked  if  he
illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled  substances  in  the  last  seven  years.  He  failed  to
report  his  marijuana  use  between  2011  and  November  2013.  (GE  1)  He  denied
intentionally  providing  false  information  about  his  marijuana  use  with  the  following
explanation.
I truly believed at the time that my use was over 7 years earlier. During the
intake  into  counseling,  if  I  were  informed  that  traces  of  Cannabis  were
found  in  my  system,  I  would  have  been  more  likely  to  remember  the
timeframe.  All  I  recalled,  when  answering  the  statement,  was  that
sometime during my divorce which started 2010 and filed in 2011 (7 years
earlier),  I  did  on  a  few  occasions  exercise  poor  judgment  and  use
Cannabis. The 2011 date stuck in my mind and hence why my response
was such. (Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant’s testimony was consistent in that he asserted he thought his marijuana
use was beyond the seven-year window for the question. He stated that he was never
informed  that  he  tested  positive  in  November  2013  during  his  substance  abuse
counseling, which if he had known might have sparked his memory when answering the
question. He stated that “knowing that it was that long ago. I gave myself the benefit of
the doubt.” (Tr. at 32-35, 45-55)
Applicant  responded  to  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA)
interrogatories  in  March  2019.  He  answered  “No”  to  the  question  that  asked  if  he
“EVER”  used  any  illegal  drugs.  He  denied  that  the  answer  was  intentionally  false.  He
stated  that  he  misread  the  question  and  assumed  it  was  asking  about  the  previous
seven years, and he thought his marijuana use occurred more than seven years before
his response. (Tr. at 35, 46-47, 51; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant  submitted  documents  and  letters  attesting  to  his  excellent  job
performance  over  more  than  three  decades.  He  stated  that  he  has  always  been  a
trustworthy  employee  and  he  hopes  to  be  given  the  chance  to  prove  that  he  is
deserving of a security clearance. (Tr. at 57; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE C)
