Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  in  two  states  since  February  2018.  He  is  married  for  the  second
time with a stepchild. (Tr. at 27, 30, 48; GE 1)
Applicant  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2009  and  a  master’s  degree  from  the
same university in the same field of study in 2010. That field had still not recovered from
the  recession,  and  he  was  unable  to  obtain  a  job.  He  returned  to  the  university  and
earned a second master’s degree in a different field of study in 2013. Applicant paid for
his education with student loans. (Tr. at 22-23, 29; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1;
AE A)
Applicant  worked  in  several  foreign  countries  teaching  English,  but  he  did  not
earn a  large  income. He  defaulted  on  his student  loans,  and  several other debts  went
unpaid. The SOR alleges defaulted student loans of $162,371 and $70,002 owed to the
Department  of  Education;  a  $25,229  defaulted  private  student  loan;  four  delinquent
medical  debts  totaling  $1,955;  and  two  miscellaneous  delinquent  debts  totaling  $372.
The allegations are established through credit reports and Applicant’s admissions. (Tr.
at 30; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 3-7; AE A)
Applicant  paid  $4,418  in  April  2018  to  pay  the  $292  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.h
($392 with interest) as well as a $4,024 debt to the same creditor that was not alleged in
the  SOR.  He  paid  the  $90  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  in  April  2019.  He  paid  in  full  or
settled and paid the four medical debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.g between December
2018 and May 2019. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 4-7; AE A)
Applicant was accepted into a loan rehabilitation program in March 2018 for the
student  loans  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b.  He  was  required  to  pay  at  least  nine
monthly  payments  of  $5,  after  which  the  loans  would  come  out  of  default  and  be
returned to the student loan servicing company. Applicant completed the $5 payments
in  March  2019.  In  December  2018,  $232,598  ($189,599  in  principal  and  $42,946  in
interest)  was  transferred  to  a  student  loan  servicing  company.  Applicant  made  $449
payments  in  April  and  May  2019.  He  was  accepted  into  an  income-based  repayment
plan. If he remains in the plan, any balance owed on his student loans will be forgiven
after 25  years.  The  July  2019  credit  report  lists  that  Applicant  is  current  with  his  $449
monthly payments. (Tr. at 27-28, 32-33, 36-41; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 5-7;

Applicant has not paid the $25,229 defaulted private student loan. He stated that
he  went  to  the  bank  for  information  about  the  debt,  but  the  bank  had  sold  its  student
loan  business to  a  student  loan  servicing  company.  He  spoke  with  a  vice  president at
the  bank,  who  advised  him  that  there  was  no  means  to  rehabilitate  the  loan,  and  he
should dispute it through the credit reporting agencies. Applicant spent about 11 hours
on the phone unsuccessfully attempting to locate who if anyone currently owns the loan,
but the student loan servicing company informed him that they had no record of him or
his  loan.  The  loan  is  reported  by  all  three  credit  reporting  agencies  on  the  May  2018
combined  credit  report  and  on  the  January  2019  Equifax  credit  report  as  charged  off
with an amount of $25,229 and a $0 balance. It is reported on the June 2019 Experian
credit report as “Paid, was a charge off,” with a $0 balance.  It is not listed on the July
2019 Equifax credit report. (Tr. at 33-36; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5-7; AE A)
Applicant  stated  that  his finances  are  currently  in  good  condition. He  has about
$7,000 in a savings account. He earns a good salary, and he recently transferred from
an expensive  area  of  the  country  to  an area where  the  cost  of  living  is much  less.  He
purchased  a home  with  a favorable mortgage  rate.  He  is current  on  his auto  loan.  He
stated  that  he  will  be  able  to  maintain  his  student  loan  payments  and  provide  for  his
family. (Tr. at 22, 25, 27, 43-46, 66; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5-7; AE A, C)
Applicant’s  wife  and her family  are  citizens  and  residents  of the  Philippines.  He
was introduced to his wife online by a mutual friend while he was working overseas. He
visited her in the Philippines several times, and they knew each other about two years
before they married in 2017. She has remained in the Philippines while her immigration
visa  is  being  processed.  He  stated  that  they  are  in  the  late  stages  of  the  application.
Applicant’s in-laws in the Philippines fish and farm for a living. (Tr. at 23-25, 31, 48-50;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1; AE A, D)
Applicant provides his wife about $250 to $350 per month in support. His family
has  a  history  of  military  service.  A  childhood  illness  prevented  Applicant  from  serving,
but he feels that he is helping through his job. He credibly testified that that his family in
the  Philippines  could  not  be  used  to  coerce  or  intimidate  him  into  revealing  classified
information. (Tr. at 23-25, 41, 56, 66; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant  submitted  letters  attesting  to  his  strong  moral  character and  excellent
job  performance.  He  is  praised  for  his  trustworthiness,  reliability,  honesty,  dedication,
work ethic, and integrity. (AE B)
