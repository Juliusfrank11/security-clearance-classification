The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the March 15, 2019 SOR, Applicant
owed a charged-off loan of $18,071 (SOR ¶ 1.a); two charged-off credit-card debts of $823
(SOR ¶ 1.e) and $517 (SOR ¶ 1.g); a charged-off credit union debt of $598 (SOR ¶ 1.f);
past-due medical debts of $1,275 (SOR ¶ 1.d) and $56 (SOR ¶ 1.j);  and six collection
debts  totaling  $5,127  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b-1.c,  1.h-1.i,  and  1.k-1.l).  (Item  1.)  When  Applicant
responded  to  the  SOR  allegations,  he  admitted  the  debts,  which  he  attributed  to  his
separation and divorce. He had to move and without his ex-wife’s assistance, he could not
make his payments. He added that he was “slowly working on getting everything back in
order.” (Item 2.) After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant’s Answer to the
SOR, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 35-year-old defense-contractor employee seeking a DOD security
clearance. He has been working for his current employer as a designer since February
2017. Applicant was divorced in August 2012 after almost eight years of marriage. He has
no children. He reports that he was homeless or lived with family members between July
2007 and June 2008, and that he lived with his parents from October 2010 to February
2013, so he and his ex-wife may have been separated well before their divorce, although it
is unclear. (Item 3.)
Applicant worked as an automobile technician at a quick oil and lubrication facility
from January 2007 to January 2008. While employed as a salesman at a car dealership
from January 2008 to March 2009, he began studies toward a career change.  Applicant
earned an associate’s degree in June 2014 from a technical institute, which he attended
from 2008 to 2010 and 2013 to 2014. (Item 3.) He obtained student loans of more than
$26,000 between January 2009 and November 2010 and more than $16,000 between July
2013 and February 2014. (Item 5.)
Applicant worked while he was in school and during a break from his studies. He lost
his job at the car dealership when the business closed, and then worked in operations
support for a plastics company from March 2009 until November 2011, when he was laid
off.  He  spent  the  next  two  years  as  a  forklift  operator.  In  November  2013,  Applicant
secured  a  job  in  his  career  field  of  graphic  design,  and  he  worked  full  time  as  an
engineering technician, staying on after he earned his degree until February 2017, when he
relocated for his defense-contractor job. Apparently, his current employer gave him a job
offer that he could not pass up. (Item 3.) The evidentiary record provided for my review
contains no income information for Applicant in his previous or present employments.
Applicant defaulted on some consumer credit debts after his divorce. A joint car loan
obtained  for  $18,789  in  May  2014,  after  his  divorce,  was  charged  off  for  $18,539  in
September 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.a). A $2,548 balance owed to another creditor was placed for
collection in December 2016 due to inactivity since August 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.b). A $1,752
wireless-phone debt from March 2014 was referred for collection in March 2017 (SOR ¶
1.c). In November 2014, a credit union charged off a $598 deposit-related debt (SOR ¶
1.f). A credit-card account opened in August 2014 with a $300 credit limit was charged off
for $517 in November 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.g). He obtained a second credit card with the same
lender in February 2016 with a $700 credit limit. In August 2016, that account was charged
off for $823 (SOR ¶ 1.e). Three medical debts from 2015, of $1,265 (SOR ¶ 1.d), $56
(SOR  ¶  1.j)  and  $62  (SOR  ¶  1.l),  were  referred  for  collection.  Applicant  made  timely
payments of $469 per month on a car loan of $21,499 obtained in November 2014 with the
exception of December 2016, when he fell behind 30 days. In April 2016, he took on a
second car loan, of $30,135, to be repaid at $475 per month. He made those car payments
on time. (Item 5.) He provided no information about why he needed another vehicle.
When Applicant relocated for his job in 2017, he owed $94 on his power bill for his
previous residence. The debt was placed for collection in June 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.i). In his
new locale, he bought home furnishings on credit for $1,267. He made his $84 monthly
payments on time, but his old delinquencies went unpaid, and a $318 medical debt went to
collections in April 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.k). (Item 5.)
On  December  8,  2017,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He responded affirmatively to the
following financial inquiry: “In the past seven (7) years, you had bills or debts turned over to
a collection agency.” He disclosed a $1,700 wireless-telephone debt in collection (SOR ¶
1.c), stating, “Was on a joint account and people didn’t pay [their] bill,” and a $353 cable bill
(SOR ¶ 1.d), stating, “When I moved service was canceled but I still received [another] bill I
was aware of.” He also responded affirmatively to an inquiry concerning whether he had
any  account  or  credit  card  suspended,  charged  off,  or  cancelled  for  failure  to  make
payments in the last seven years, and listed a credit card in collection (SOR ¶ 1.g) for
approximately $2,500. He indicated that he was saving up money to pay the debts.  (Item
3.)
As  of  February  3,  2018,  Applicant  had  made  no  progress  toward  resolving  his
delinquent debts. His student-loan debt had reportedly accrued to $58,641. His student
loans were rated as current, although it is unclear whether one or all of his loans were
being repaid or were in deferment. (Item 5.)
As of February 2019, Applicant’s credit report showed that he was making payments
on three car loans: his April 2016 car loan (balance $19,758), which had been late 30 days
in November 2018; his November 2014 vehicle loan (balance $10,101), which had been
current since January 2017; and a new loan obtained in January 2019 for $24,948, to be
repaid at $651 per month. His furniture account opened in April 2017 was $159 past due
on  a  balance  of  $1,171.  He  had  made  no  progress  toward  resolving  those  of  his  old
delinquencies that were still on his credit record (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.j). The collection debts in
SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.l were no longer on his credit record, but no payments for those debts
are  in  evidence.  Applicant  had  refinanced  some  of  his  student  loans  through  a
consolidated loan of $36,941 in January 2018. He was making timely payments on six
credit  cards,  which  had  been  opened  since  December  2017.  The  six  accounts  had  a
combined balance of $3,182. (Item 4.)
There is no evidence of any efforts on Applicant’s part to address the delinquent
debts alleged in the SOR. He attributes his financial problems to his divorce (Item 2), but
the debts at issue became delinquent when he was gainfully employed, years after his
divorce. He has taken on new debts as his past-due debts remain unresolved.
