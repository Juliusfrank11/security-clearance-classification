Applicant is 29 years old. He is divorced and has no children. (Item 2 at pages 7

and attributes them to a failed marriage and periods of unemployment.
1.a.~1.d.,  and  1.f.~1.h.  Applicant  admits  that  he  has  past-due  student  loans
totaling  about  $27,431.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  avers,  “I  have  entered  an  agreement
with Pioneer Debt Solutions, I pay (5) dollars a month and will continue until July 2019.
After I have successfully paid the (9) [$45] required payments my loan will be brought
out of default.” (Answer at page 1.) As these debts appear on Applicant’s February 2019
credit report (Item 5 at pages 1~2); and as he has submitted nothing in support of his
averment, these allegations are found against Applicant.

submitted nothing in support of his averment, this allegation is found against Applicant.
