In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 31-year-old refueler and outside machinist employed by a defense
contractor since October 2017. He has never held a security clearance.
Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in May 2010. He was employed as the dean
of  students  at  a  public  school  from  September  2010  to  August  2014.  He  moved  from
another state to his state of current residence to be nearer to a woman who became his
cohabitant  and  to  seek  a  better-paying  job.  He  found  employment  as  a  mathematics
teacher in a public school in June 2014. He bought a home in March 2016. (Tr. 55-56.)
His  cohabitant  was  not  employed,  and  Applicant  paid  her medical bills,  car payments,
and her other “needs,” which he did not define. His provisional teaching certificate expired
in  2017,  and he failed  the  test for recertification.  He  was  unemployed  from  June 2017
until  he  was  hired  for  his  current  job.  He  fell  behind  on  his  payments  during  his
unemployment. (Tr. 61.) He lost about $200 in wages while visiting his seriously ill father.
(Tr. 71.) He broke up with his cohabitant around June 2018 (Tr. 61.)
In  October  2018,  Applicant  was  questioned  about  his  delinquent  debts  by  a
security investigator. (GX 2.) He hired a credit counselor in March 2019.  It is not clear
from the record whether he hired the credit counselor before or after the SOR was issued
on March 13, 2019, but he attached documents from his credit counselor to his answer
to the SOR.
Applicant’s credit counselor testified that she has been in business for 26 years
and has about 600 clients. (Tr. 19, 26.) She testified that she is in the process of being
certified  by  the  state  as  a  credit  counselor.  (Tr.  36.)  She  is  the  sole  member  of  her
company. (Tr. 45.) She testified that she prepared a budget for Applicant, reviewed his
financial situation, and was in the process of negotiating with creditors. She anticipated
that a financial plan for Applicant would be completed by December 2019. (Tr. 20.) She
charges $287.50 as a retainer fee and an $80 application fee. Applicant will pay $50 every
two  weeks  until  his financial  goals  are  met.  The  fees  are  for her  services  and  are  not
applied to Applicant’s debts. (Tr. 25.) As of the date of the hearing, Applicant had not yet
started paying the fees. (Tr. 27.)
The SOR alleges eight delinquent consumer debts totaling about $20,964, which
are reflected in credit reports from February 2019 and January 2018. (GX 3 and 4.) The
evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: unsecured loan charged off for $9,735 in January 2017. Applicant
incurred this debt to install a new heating and cooling system in his home. He knew the
system needed to be replaced when he bought the home. (Tr. 66.) His payments were
$150 per month. He stopped making payments in 2017, when he became unemployed.
He  did  not  contact  the  creditor  or  make  any  efforts  to  resolve  this  debt.  (GX  2  at  2.)
Applicant’s  credit  counselor  testified  that  she  had  contacted  the  creditor  and  that  they
agreed to send her a written offer, but she had not received it as of the date of the hearing.
(Tr.  27-29.)  After  the  hearing,  Applicant’s  credit  counselor  submitted  a  status  report
reciting that the creditor had insisted on full payment and Applicant had agreed to make
monthly  $300  payments  until  a  lower  settlement  amount  is  offered.  (AX  A.)  Applicant
submitted no evidence of payments under this agreement.
SOR  ¶  1.b:  collection  account  for  $4,836,  opened  in  September  2017.
Applicant’s credit counselor testified that she had disputed the amount of the debt and
that the collection agency was willing settle for 25% of the amount. (Tr. 29.) She testified
that this debt is for homeowners’ association fees. (Tr. 30.)  However, her status report
indicates  that  the  original  creditor  is  an  electronics  and  appliance  store.  The  credit
counselor  testified  that  she  had  received  a  written  settlement  offer,  and  that  she
anticipated that the debt would be settled by September 15, 2019. (Tr. 31-32.) Her status
report reflects that the collection agency had agreed to accept monthly $100 payments
beginning in October 2019.
SOR ¶ 1.c: credit-card account charged off for $2,579 in May 2017. Applicant’s
credit counselor testified that she was trying to negotiate a settlement but had not received
a written offer. (Tr. 33.) Her status report recites that the creditor agreed to settle the debt
for $515 and that Applicant agreed to make a $100 payment and pay the balance within
30 days. Applicant submitted no evidence of any payments under this agreement.
SOR ¶ 1.d: charge account charged off for $2,174 in August 2016. Applicant’s
credit counselor testified that she disputed the amount of the debt. She testified that, in
March 2019, she offered to pay $1,000 in three installments, but she had not received a
response  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing.  (Tr.  36-37.)  Her  status  report  recites  that  the
creditor  agreed  to  settle  the  debt  for  $869,  with  monthly  $75  payments  beginning  in
October 2019.
SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.g: telecommunications debts placed for collection of $426
in  August  2017  and charged  off  for  $300  in  May  2016.  Applicant’s  credit  counselor
testified that these accounts are duplicates. She testified that this creditor has offered to
settle the debts for $175, but she had not received the offer in writing. (Tr. 39.) Her status
report recites that both debts were disputed, one debt was deleted from the credit record,
and the other is under investigation. Only one $300 debt to this creditor is reflected in the
February 2019 credit report. (GX 3.) Applicant submitted no evidence of payments on the
$300 debt.
SOR ¶ 1.f: charge account charged off for $335 in May 2016. Applicant’s credit
counselor testified that she asked the creditor to remove some of the late fees included
in this debt, but she did not recommend settling this account because it would preclude
Applicant  from  obtaining  another  account  with  this  creditor.  (Tr.  42.)  The  status  report
recites  that  this  debt  is  no  longer  collectable  under  local  law  and  will  be  deleted  from
Applicant’s credit reports. Applicant has made no payments on this debt.
SOR  ¶  1.h:  telecommunications  account  placed  for  collection  of  $579  in
November  2017.  This  debt  is  for  unreturned  equipment.  Applicant  testified  that  the
equipment had been returned. (Tr. 43.) His credit counselor testified that the account has
been  reopened.  The  status  report  recites  that  the  equipment  has  been  returned  and
deletion of the credit-report entry is pending. The debt was not reflected in the February
2019 credit report. (GX 3.) This debt is resolved.
Applicant  did  not  submit  documentary  evidence  of  any  payment  agreements,
payments, or correspondence from creditors for any of the debts alleged in the SOR. The
credit  counselor’s  status  report  includes  a  footnote  reciting  that  Applicant  is  currently
waiting for letters from creditors and that payment plans are scheduled to be completed
by March 2020. (AX A.)
Applicant currently earns about $42,000 per year. His net monthly remainder after
paying all living expenses is $500-600. (Tr. 67.)
