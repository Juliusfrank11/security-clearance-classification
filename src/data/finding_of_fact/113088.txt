After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant’s Answer to the SOR (Item 1),
I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 54-year-old field service representative with a pharmacy technology
company. He started his current employment in April 2018. Applicant earned a bachelor’s
degree in June 2004 and master’s degrees in business administration in August 2011 and
human resource management in December 2012.  He has been married to his current
spouse since March 1994. His first marriage lasted a little over a year and ended in divorce
in March 1993. Applicant and his spouse have two sons, ages 13 and 15. (Items 2-3.)
Applicant  was  previously  employed  as  a  field  service  engineer  with  a  medical
devices and healthcare company from April 2003 to December 2013, when he was laid off
during a corporate reorganization. He was given a severance package, the terms of which
are not in the record. He collected unemployment compensation of $275 a week until June
2014, when he founded a tire distribution business with three partners. The venture was
underfunded and folded after two years. From August 2014 to March 2018, he also had a
part-time motor sports business, but it failed to generate the income needed to support his
expenses. He closed the business when he began working for his current employer. (Item
2.)
On  September  3,  2018,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He disclosed marijuana possession
charges  from  January  1998  and  March  1999;  the  use  of  tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC)
between  January  1983  to  January  2018;  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  filing  dismissed  in
August 2018; the foreclosure of his home mortgage; and credit-card delinquency totaling
$30,609  on  nine  accounts  pending  debt  consolidation.  Under  the  SF  86  section  for
additional comments, he noted that he and his spouse had initiated a debt consolidation
program for her finances, and that if it worked out as planned, he would incorporate his
own debts as well. (Item 2.) The salient details of his financial issues and THC use follow.
Finances
Applicant  bought  a  home  for  his  family  in  1999.  (Item  2.)  In  August  2005,  the
creditor  in  SOR  ¶  1.g  acquired  the  mortgage,  which  had  a  balance  of  $310,000  and
required repayment at $1,833 per month for 30 years. During the economic downturn in
2008, the home lost value to where he owed more on the mortgage than the property was
worth.  Under  some  financial  distress  because  of  the  lack  of  employment  income  and
seeking  to  lower  his  monthly  payments,  Applicant  tried  three  times  to  have  his  loan
modified. He stopped making his mortgage payments during the process, but was not
successful in having his loan modified. As of August 2018, the loan was $65,000 in arrears
on a balance of $415,933 and in foreclosure. Applicant unsuccessfully attempted a short
sale  to  avert  a  foreclosure  sale  that  was  set  for October 16,  2018.  (Items  3-5.)  When
interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
on  October  19,  2018,  Applicant  explained  that  he  was  negotiating  with  the  creditor  to
surrender the property in a “cash for keys” where the lender would agree to wipe out the
difference between the $325,000 expected sale price of the property and his loan balance.
(Item 3.) When he responded to the SOR in August 2019,  Applicant indicated that his
house sold in foreclosure for $328,000, which exceeded the original balance of the loan,
and  that  the  debt  had  been  removed  from  his  credit  record.  (Item  1.)  He  provided  no
corroborating documentation of the sale, but Equifax reported no mortgage trades on his
credit record as of March 4, 2019. (Item 5.)
In July 2018, Applicant filed for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy (SOR ¶ 1.i) to address his
delinquent  mortgage  loan  and  several  credit-card  delinquencies  incurred  because  his
motor sports business did not generate enough income for him to pay all his bills. He listed
indebtedness  totaling  approximately  $700,000.  Applicant  completed  the  required  pre-
petition  credit  counseling,  but  his  bankruptcy  case  was  dismissed  in  August  2018,
reportedly  because  he  did  not  meet  the  financial  threshold  required  to  complete  the
bankruptcy process. (Item 3.)
As of October 9, 2018, Applicant’s credit record showed that he owed $5,269 on a
credit-card  account  opened  in  July  2015  and  charged  off  in  August  2018  after  being
inactive since August 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.c). Five credit cards obtained in January 2016 were
charged off or in collection with balances of $9,224 (SOR ¶ 1.a, in collection); $6,781 (SOR
¶ 1.b, in collection); $2,492 (SOR ¶ 1.e, charged off); $1,340 (SOR ¶ 1.f, in collection); and
$2,666 (SOR ¶ 1.h, charged off). Additionally, a $4,171 credit-card balance had been in
collection since March 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.d). (Item 4.) During his October 2018 OPM interview,
Applicant  did  not  dispute  the  debts.  He  indicated  that  he  had  included  them  on  his
dismissed bankruptcy, and was working through a credit repair company to consolidate his
debts to make monthly payments. (Item 3.) On December 31, 2018, the creditor identified
in SOR ¶ 1.b had cancelled a debt of $6,781. (Item 1.)
As  of  March  4,  2019,  Applicant  had  made  no  payments  on  his  credit-card
delinquencies alleged in the SOR. (Item 5.) He was aware of his obligation to report the
$6,781  as  cancelled  debt  on  his  income  tax  return  (Item  1),  although  he  provided  no
documentation showing that it had been included on his income tax return for tax year
2018. The $2,666 charged-off balance on a gas company credit card (SOR ¶ 1.h) was not
on his credit record with Equifax as of March 2019, but there is no evidence that it had
been paid. (Item 5.)
Applicant retained the services of a debt consolidation company around the time
that he began his current employment. Apparently “after several months of promises and
inactivity,” he terminated its services. (Item 1.) Applicant did not provide any information
about payments made, if any, to the company. On May 1, 2019, Applicant contracted with
another company to validate debts, dispute erroneous information on his credit reports,
and to provide him with financial education. (Item 1.)
On March 29, 2019, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant, alleging in part his
delinquent debts and dismissed bankruptcy. Applicant received the SOR on May 6, 2019.
On May 22, 2019, he requested an extension of time to respond to the SOR. He indicated
that he had tried unsuccessfully to reach settlements with his creditors before hiring the
first debt repair firm, which then failed to perform as expected. He expressed satisfaction
with the progress being made by the company currently retained to investigate, and where
necessary dispute the items on his credit report, but he also indicated that the company
had some problems locating two accounts (not identified) listed in the SOR. He stated that
he expected to have his debts settled within the next six months. (Item 1.)
On July 30, 2019, the debt repair company certified that the dismissed bankruptcy
and the consumer debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c had been deleted from one or more of the
three  credit  bureaus’  records  and  that  the  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.d-1.f  were
“undergoing  repair.”  (Item  1.)    In  response  to  the  SOR  on  August  3,  2019,  Applicant
indicated that the credit-card debt in SOR ¶ 1.h had been deleted from his record all three
credit bureaus, but the accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.d-1.f were still “undergoing repair.”
He added that it was taking some time to get the items resolved, explaining as follows:
Every disputed item has 45 days to respond and if no response they get
another 45 days. Then once validated we initiate a mutually agreed upon
settlement that will reflect on my credit report eventually. These results can
take  6  months  or  more  to  reflect  on  my  credit  report,  yet  we  are  seeing
results already. (Item 1.)
Applicant  had  an  opportunity  to  provide  updated  information  in  rebuttal  to  the
FORM.  There is no indication that he responded by the October 26, 2019 deadline. No
information  was  presented  about  Applicant’s  present  income  or  expenses.  During  his
October 2018 interview, Applicant indicated that he was able to pay his current bills and
debts  on  his  current  income.  (Item  3.)   He  provided  no  details  about  the  extent  of  his
spouse’s debts that were reportedly being repaid through debt consolidation. Available
information shows that Applicant owes approximately $150,140 in federal student loans.
(Item 5.) Applicant told the OPM investigator that his federal loans were in a forbearance
program with income-based repayment to start sometime in 2019. (Item 3.) It is unclear
whether he has started repaying his student loans.
Drug Involvement
Applicant was arrested twice on marijuana charges. In January 1988, he was pulled
over for making an improper left turn, and marijuana was found in his car. He was charged
with felony possession of marijuana. Adjudication was withheld and he was required to
make charitable donations totaling $1,000. He denies that he intended to sell any of the
marijuana in his possession. In March 1999, he was similarly stopped for a traffic violation,
and a small amount of marijuana was discovered in his ashtray. The drug charge was not
prosecuted. (Items 2-3.)
On his September 2018 SF 86, Applicant responded affirmatively to whether he had
used any illegal drug in the last seven years and stated that he had inhaled vapor from
cannabis oil on several occasions, but that he was not a user and did not like it. Regarding
his use of THC between the listed dates of January 1983 and January 2018, Applicant
stated:
Over the years it was helpful for dealing with stress, it no longer works for
me. I was a weekly user prior to 2004. Since then I have tried it on a few
occasions. I have found holistic alternatives to dealing with the day to day
stresses.
Applicant denied any intention to use cannabis in the future because it makes him anxious
and nervous and stated that he has turned to melatonin and valerian root as alternatives.
(Item 2.)
Applicant provided a detailed account of his involvement with THC and cannabis
derivatives when interviewed by the OPM investigator in October 2018. He reported a first
use of marijuana in January 1983. He purchased the drug from a friend and smoked it
through a pipe in his residence. He continued to use marijuana on a daily basis until his
marriage in March 1994. From March 1994 to the birth of his first son in November 2004,
Applicant used marijuana once or twice weekly. His use of marijuana then declined to once
a week until 2008, when he stated that he decided to cease his use because marijuana
made him anxious. He stated that he abstained from all forms of cannabis until January
2018, when he tried CBD obtained from a friend. He told the OPM investigator in August
2018 that he did not like the effects of the CBD and would not use it again. Applicant told
the  OPM  investigator that  he  purchased  the  marijuana he used over the years from a
friend, although he did not indicate whether or not he was continuing to associate with the
person who supplied him with marijuana and CBD. (Item 3.)
Applicant now claims that his use of marijuana after 2004 was rare, and that he
cannot recall using marijuana after 2006. He instead asserts that since then, he “tried” CBD
oil and vapor, extracted from hemp, as a sleep aid:
I have done some research and found that CBD from hemp is now legal on a
federal level. For CBD hemp oil products to test positive on a drug test, an
individual would have to be using unusually large amounts (above 1000-2000
mg) of  the  product. Hemp based CBD oils, when used in low doses, are
unlikely to result in a positive drug test because they often don’t contain high
enough levels of THC for detection. Although unregulated CBD hemp oils
contain some THC it is a negligible amount of up to .3% THC or less and
thus will not even be detectable in [a] traditional drug test. Again, I am not a
user  [but]  I  did  try  it  on  a  few  separate  instances.  Many  legitimate  CBD
products  contain  small  amounts  of  THC,  the  component  that  is  federally
controlled. And when taken regularly over as little as four to six days, that
THC can accumulate in the body, according to several studies. My use of
CBD was sporadic having tried it on a rare occasion prior to any employment
with [my employer]. (Item 1.)
