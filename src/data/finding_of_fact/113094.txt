Applicant  is  a  63-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  worked  for  a
company  from  1986  until  he  retired  in  2017.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer
since  then.  He  also  worked  a  part-time  job  from  2014  to  2017.  He  has  a  bachelor’s
degree. He is divorced with an adult child. (Tr. at 44-46; GE 1, 2)
In  2014,  Applicant  made  an  ill-advised  decision  to  invest  in  real  estate  and  flip
houses. He bought a house with the assistance of a company that provides instructions
on  how  to  flip  houses.  He  bought  a  house  that  needed  repairs  for  about  $82,000.  He
thought  he  could  renovate  the  house  for  about  $38,000  and  sell  the  house  for  about
$145,000. The house needed more repairs than anticipated; the general contractor did
shoddy  work;  the  house  was  unable  to  pass  inspections;  Applicant  was  unable  to  sell
the  house  for  what  he  had  invested  in  it;  and  it  was  lost  to  foreclosure.  There  is  no
evidence  of  a  deficiency  owed  on  the  mortgage  loan.  (Tr.  at  16-28,  37;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant  did  not  fully  understand  the  economics  of  his  investment.  He  funded
the  venture  with  one  or  more  mortgage  loans  and  his  personal  credit,  including  credit
cards. He significantly overextended himself, and a number of debts went unpaid. (Tr. at
37-44, 47-52; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-4)
The  SOR  alleges  the  foreclosed  investment  property  and  ten  delinquent  debts
totaling about $47,700. Applicant admitted owing all the debts with the exception of the
$121 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j, which he did not recognize.  The debts are listed on a
July 2017 credit report, a February 2019 credit report, or both credit reports. (Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 3, 4)
Applicant contracted with a debt-settlement company in about 2016 to assist him
in  resolving  his  debts.  He  enrolled  13  debts,  totaling  $86,600,  in  the  company’s  debt-
relief program (DRP). He pays $1,273 into an escrow account each month.  He missed
about  six  to  nine  months  of  payments  to  the  DRP  during  a  period  when  he  was  not
receiving overtime hours, but he resumed the payments. The debt-settlement company
agreed to negotiate settlements with his creditors and use the accumulated funds in the
escrow  account,  minus  fees,  to  pay  the  settlements.  (Tr.  at  29-30,  46-50;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2; AE-B-F)
Four  debts  with  original  balances  totaling  $36,041  were  settled  for  $17,398.
These debts were not alleged in the SOR as the settlement payments were completed
before  the  SOR  was  issued.  A  fifth  debt  with  a  $500  original  balance  was  settled  for
$322.  The  settlement  payments  for  this  debt  were  completed  before  the  SOR  was
issued, or shortly thereafter. This debt appears to correspond to the $328 debt alleged
in SOR ¶ 1.i. (GE 3, 4; AE B, C)
The  remaining  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  are  enrolled  in  the  DRP,  with  the
exception of the $576 debt alleged in  SOR ¶ 1.g and the  $121 debt alleged in SOR  ¶
1.j. Applicant admitted owing the $576 debt. He was unsure why it is not in the DRP. He
thought  he  received  recent  information  from  the  debt-settlement  company  about  the
debt. He relies on the debt-settlement company to deal with his creditors, and he stated
that the $576 debt will be addressed. He still does not recognize the $121 debt. Five of
the debts in the DRP, with original balances totaling $45,847, were settled for $22,102.
Payments  for  three  of  the  settled  debts  are  being  made.  Payments  for  the  last  two
settled debts have not started yet. Three of the debts in the DRP, with original balances
totaling $4,199, have not been settled yet. (Tr. at 52-69; Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 3, 4; AE B-F)
Applicant’s current finances are much better. He is receiving retirement pay from
the job he held for 31 years. He credibly testified that he will remain in the DRP for the
additional approximately two years it will take to settle and pay his remaining debts. He
is also  considering  taking  out  a  loan  to expedite  the  process.  He  realizes  that  his real
estate investment was a fiasco. He does not intend to repeat his mistake. (Tr. at 30-32,
53, 69-76; AE A-F)
