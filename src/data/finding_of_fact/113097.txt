Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 42 years old. She is a high school graduate. She married in 1996 and
divorced in 2000. She has a 22-year-old child from the marriage. In 2002, she began a
civil union and has two children from the union. They are 16 and 9 years old. Applicant
was  employed  from  September  2009  to  July  2018.  She  left  that  job  and  has  been
employed by a federal contractor since July 2018. (Item 2)
Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in August 2018. In it
she disclosed she had numerous delinquent debts that had been turned over to collection
agencies. She stated:
I had over extended myself in credit card debt. I had been struggling to pay
at  least  the  minimum  credit  card  payments  up  until  2017.  In  2017  my
husband didn’t receive any income for approx[imately] 3-4 months and at
the time I became so behind on the credit cards bills, other bills, and the
minimum payments became so large that I was unable to pay. (Item 2)
She further stated that she had been working with the collection agencies to pay off the
debts and was making monthly payments on many of the delinquent debts. (Item 2)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in November 2018. She
confirmed  her  delinquent  debts  and  reiterated  she  was  making  monthly  payments  on
many of them. She explained that the reason for her delinquent debt was because she
was overextending herself by shopping at retail stores and her husband’s unemployment
at  the  time.  She  believed  her  financial  situation  was  improving  with  her  new  job.  She
stated  that  she  will  no  longer  use  credit  cards.  She  did  not  participate  in  financial
counseling. She did not provide supporting documents to corroborate that she is making
monthly  payments  on  her delinquent  debts. She  did not  provide  information  about  her
current financial situation or a budget. (Item 3)
Credit reports from October 2017 and May 2019 corroborate the delinquent debts.
A review of the May 2019 credit report shows that the collection account alleged in SOR
¶ 1.c ($1,968) has a reduced balance of $1,480 that is past due. The credit report states
that there is a partial payment agreement in place and the last payment made was $70 in
April 2019. (Items 4, 5)
Applicant stated in her SCA that she had made a payment arrangement for the
debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($4,125). She was to make monthly payments of $125. Her 2017 and
2019  credit  reports  do  not  reflect  any  payments  being  made  and  the  debt  remains  in
collection. (Items 2, 4, 5)
Applicant stated in her SCA that she negotiated a payment plan of $150 a month
for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($4,677). Her 2019 credit report shows a reduced balance, but
the debt is still past due. It shows she last made a payment in March 2019. It appears she
is paying the debt, but she failed to provide additional documents to show more recent
payments. (Items 2, 4, 5)
There is no evidence that the collection account in SOR  ¶ 1.d ($1,660) is being
paid. There is no evidence that the delinquent debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($1,007) is being paid.
(Items 4, 5)
The 2019 credit bureau report shows that the charged-off account in SOR  ¶ 1.f
($500) was paid in approximately February 2019. (Item 5)
The collection account in SOR ¶ 1.g ($4,538) shows a reduced balance in the May
2019 credit report ($3,804). It also indicated the last payment made was in March 2019.
It appears Applicant is paying this debt, but she failed to provide additional documents to
show more recent payments. (Items 2, 4, 5)
The collection account in SOR ¶ 1.h ($1,822) shows a reduced balance in the May
2019 credit report ($1,114). It indicated the last payment made was in March 2019. The
collection account in SOR ¶ 1.i ($1,707) shows a reduced balance in the May 2019 credit
report ($1,407) and it indicated the last payment made was in March 2019. The collection
account in SOR ¶ 1.j ($1,050) shows a reduced balance in the May 2019 credit report
($633)  and  the  last  payment  was  in  March 2019. The  collection  account  in  SOR  ¶ 1.k
($721)  reflects  a  zero  balance  in  the  May  2019  credit  report  and  indicated  the  last
payment was in March 2019.
