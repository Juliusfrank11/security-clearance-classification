Applicant, age 60, is divorced and has no children. He served in the U.S. Marine
Corps from 1977 through 1981, when he received an honorable discharge. He earned an
associate degree in 1996. He has been employed as a sensors and systems technician
by a defense contractor since 2014. (Items 2, 3)
Applicant was granted DOD security clearances in 1983 and 2016. He maintained
an interim clearance during the adjudication of the background investigation initiated by
SCA 1, which began in March 2016 and concluded in September 2016. In October 2016,
the  DOD  CAF  granted  him  a  final  clearance  after  concluding  that  he  mitigated  the
personal conduct, financial considerations, and criminal conduct concerns raised by SCA
1.  In  February  2017,  the  DOD  CAF  requested  that  Applicant  complete  SCA  2  in
connection  with  its  investigation  focused  on  the  concerns  raised  by  a  January  2017
incident report about an October 2016 driving under the influence (DUI) charge. Applicant
submitted SCA 2 in April 2017. That investigation, which concluded in December 2018,
resulted in the SOR, which was referred to this office for final adjudication. (Item 2 at 35;
Item 3 at 38-39; Item 5 at 6-7; Items 6 and 7)
The  SOR  alleged  Guideline  H  and  E  concerns  involving  Applicant’s  use  of
marijuana and other illegal drugs, including while he served in the Marine Corps and also
while he possessed a security clearance. It also alleged Guideline E concerns involving
Applicant’s  deliberate  SCA  falsifications,  excessive  alcohol  consumption,  and  a  2012
assault charge.
Applicant’s marijuana use began in 1974 at age 15. He used it three times during
high school. He began smoking marijuana on a daily basis when he joined the  Marine
Corps in 1977 at age 18. His marijuana use continued through at least February 24, 2017
at age 57 (except for one six-month period of abstinence noted below). The amount of
his daily marijuana consumption varied over those years, as follows: 1) five to six joints
(1977 through 1979); 2) a “couple of hits” (1979 through 1980), which was during a time
when his marijuana supply was limited while stationed overseas; 3) five to six joints (1980
through 1981); 4) three to four joints (1981 through 1995); 5) two joints (1995 through
2012);  and  5)  four  to  five  joints  (2012  through  February  2017).  Between  1977  and
February  2017,  he  had  abstained  from  his  daily  marijuana  use  only  one  time:  an
unspecified period of six months sometime during his marriage (between 1980 and 1987),
when  his  then  wife  dared  him  to  stop.  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  purchased
marijuana from unspecified friends, but denied ever selling it. (Item 2 at 24; Item 4 at 5,
16, 18)
Applicant used other illegal drugs at various times. In 1978 at age 19, he consumed
amphetamines twice: by taking a methamphetamine (speed) pill once, and by smoking
crystal methamphetamine once. He consumed lysergic acid diethylamide (acid) on four
occasions in 1979 at age 20, and then one time in 1995 at age 36. Between 1979 (age
20) and 2006 (age 37), he used cocaine six times. In 2012 at age 53, he tried heroin on
one occasion to see what it was about since his girlfriend was abusing it at the time. (Item
4 at 16; Item 5 at 8)
In 2012, Applicant kneed his girlfriend in the back for which he was charged with
felony assault with a dangerous weapon. After he pled guilty to the reduced charge of
misdemeanor simple assault, he was sentenced to one year of probation and fined $600.
His girlfriend was also granted a one-year order of protection against him. He successfully
complied with the terms of his probation and the protective order. After the order expired,
he resumed the relationship with his girlfriend, which continued through at least August
2018. This is the same girlfriend from whom Applicant obtained heroin. (Item 2 at 30-32;
Item 3 at 30-32; Item 4 at 9, 16, 24, 25; Item 5 at 5)
In October 2016, Applicant drove under the influence of marijuana. After the police
officer  who  stopped  him  for  a  traffic  violation  smelled  marijuana  emanating  from
Applicant’s car, he was issued a field sobriety test, which he failed. The officer also found
the remains of four previously-smoked marijuana joints in the driver’s side door. Applicant
denied smoking marijuana while he was driving, but admitted that he had smoked it while
parked  in  his  car  three  hours  prior  to  driving.  His  blood  sample  tested  positive  for
marijuana.  He  was  arrested  and  spent  one  night  in  jail.  Applicant  pled  guilty  to
misdemeanor DUI of marijuana for which he was accepted into a first-time offenders pre-
trial intervention program, consisting of six months of probation and an $1,800 fine. His
driver’s license was suspended for two months. He was ordered to complete 24 hours of
community  service,  take  DUI  classes,  and  attend  drug  and  alcohol  treatment.  He
successfully  completed  the  program,  which  qualified  him  for  a  dismissal  of  the  DUI
charge. (Item 3 at 29, 32-33; Item 5 at 5-6)
Applicant’s  court-ordered  treatment  consisted  of  a  drug  and  alcohol  evaluation,
seven individual therapy sessions, and an unspecified number of group therapy sessions
that  he  attended  twice  per  week.  He  entered  the  program  on  March  3,  2017  with  a
diagnosis  of  cannabis  use  disorder,  severe  (based  on  DSM-5  criteria).  Applicant  was
discharged from treatment in October 2017, as planned, upon completion of his stated
goal: “I want to not use marijuana for at least the next 7 years until I retire.” His counselor
noted Applicant’s expressed intent to remain clean and sober and that, during the course
of  his  treatment,  he  was  an  active  participant  and  remained  highly  motivated.  The
treatment records reflected a diagnosis of cannabis use disorder, in early remission, at
discharge, but did not specify a prognosis from his counselor. Nor did they articulate a
specific aftercare plan beyond referring various resources for Applicant to use as needed.
(Item 4 at 1, 3, 4, 14, 20, 22, 29-44)
During his initial intake on March 3, 2017, Applicant tested positive for marijuana,
which Applicant acknowledged he had used seven days prior. He told his counselor that
he did not stop using marijuana after his DUI until the day he received an unspecified
letter  from  the  court  on  February  24,  2017,  because  he  really  enjoyed  marijuana.
According to treatment records,  Applicant reportedly abstained from drugs and alcohol
throughout the course of his treatment and passed each of the seven drug tests to which
he was subjected. However, beginning with his first treatment session on June 2, 2017
and  continuing  through  the  last  one  on  September  22,  2017,  he  reported  his  last
marijuana use as March 16, 2017, which together with other record evidence (discussed
below) reveals that he used marijuana at least once during the interim period between his
initial intake on March 3, 2017 and the day his treatment began on June 2, 2017. There
is no record evidence that Applicant was subjected to any drug testing during that interim
period or to explain the reason for the delay in him commencing treatment after intake.
(Item 4 at 13, 16, 29-44)
During his initial intake, Applicant revealed that he routinely smoked marijuana in
his car while  driving.  His  stated triggers for marijuana  use  relapse  included  stress, his
bandmates,  and  playing  gigs.  He  reported  that  he  regularly  drove  under  the  influence
after consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. He acknowledged that, on each occasion
that  he  chose  to  drive,  he  knew  he  should  not  have  been  driving  because  he  was
“hammered.” (Item 1 at 5, 8; Item 4 at 16-18)
Applicant  tested  positive  on  an  alcohol  screening  test  administered  during
treatment,  which  raised  concerns  about  his  alcohol  use.  However,  Applicant  declined
referral for an alcohol-use assessment. He was advised to abstain from drinking alcohol
and to undergo an alcohol screening test annually. His counselor reviewed the specific
health  issues  and  risks  that  underscored  the  abstention  recommendation.  Applicant
reportedly abstained from alcohol use during treatment. (Item 4 at 1, 43-44)
During
the  security  clearance
investigations  process,  Applicant  was  not
forthcoming about his marijuana and other drug use. He answered “no” to each of the
questions in section 23 about illegal use of drugs or drug activity on SCA 1, and otherwise
failed to disclose therein his reportable marijuana use or that he used marijuana and other
illegal drugs while in possession of his 1983 security clearance. On SCA 2, he reported
the following in response to questions in section 23 about his marijuana use: 1) that he
only  used  marijuana  between  October  2016  and  March  2017,  including  while  he
possessed his 2016 security clearance; 2) that he purchased marijuana every 2 weeks
during that period; and 3) that he only smoked about two joints per day (to relieve stress
and boredom). However, he otherwise failed to disclose on SCA 2 his other reportable
marijuana use. (Item 2 at 33-34; Item 3 at 34-35)
Applicant was interviewed in August 2018 about SCA 1. There is no information in
the record to explain why SCA 2 was not also discussed. During the interview, Applicant
admitted  using  marijuana  “on  and  off  over  the  decades”  beginning  in  the  1970s.  He
asserted that his most recent use occurred between September 2016 and March 2017,
during which time he smoked at least one joint a day (about 3 grams per day), while he
possessed a security clearance. He averred that he “began smoking [marijuana] again”
in September 2016 because his friends were doing so, and that he stopped smoking it
after  his  court  date  in  March  2017.  He  did  not  enumerate  the  specific  day  during  the
interview. However, he did report the date as March 28, 2017 in SCA 2. (Item 3 at 30, 32;
Item 5 at 6)
Applicant maintained that he did not intentionally falsify SCA 1 and claimed that he
did not list his marijuana and other drug use on SCA 1 because: 1) his recent marijuana
use occurred after he completed SCA 1, 2) he had forgotten about his heroin use, and 3)
his other drug use occurred more than seven years prior. In April 2019, Applicant verified
the accuracy of the facts and circumstances he reported about his marijuana use during
the interview. (Item 5 at 6, 9, 11, and 12)
Applicant attributed his marijuana use primarily to stress, boredom, and being a
member in a band; and his other drug use to experimentation. Applicant has played in a
rock band since at least 1992. On SCA 1 and SCA 2, he identified three of his bandmates
as people who knew him well in section 16 and used two of them as references in other
sections.  He  acknowledged  that  his  bandmates  used  marijuana,  but  denied  being
tempted to use it himself when he is around them. (Item 2 at 7, 10, 22-23; Item 3 at 9, 20-
22, 35; Item 4 at 12, 17, 39; Item 5 at 6, 8-9)
As of August 2018, Applicant continued to associate with unspecified individuals
who use marijuana (because everyone he knows  uses it), but not with individuals who
use other illegal drugs. His girlfriend had actively sought help with her drug addiction and
was committed to a sober lifestyle. Applicant was regularly exposed to marijuana use, but
insisted that he was also committed to a sober lifestyle and had no future intent to resume
using marijuana because he did not want to lose his job. (Item 5 at 6 and 9)
SOR  ¶  1.f.  alleged  “You  have  routinely  used  marijuana  while  driving,”  to  which
Applicant answered: “I admit . . . I have routinely used marijuana while driving.”  SOR ¶
2.d alleged “As of your 2017 treatment . . . you were admittedly binge drinking and driving
about twice a month,” to which Applicant answered “I deny . . . I drink twice a month, not
always binge drinking, usually about 2 or 3, occasionally more. I do not drive until 3 hours
after  drinking  .  .  .”  In  the  closing  paragraph  of  Applicant’s  SOR  answer,  he  stated  the
following: “I admit to liking smoking marijuana occasionally” and “I dislike all other drugs.”
He did not explicitly address therein whether he had maintained his marijuana sobriety
since March 2017. (Item 1 at 5, 8)
