Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  in  his  Answer.  His  admissions  are
incorporated  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence,  I  make
the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 61 years old. He is not currently working for a defense contractor, but
he  has  the  opportunity  to  gain  a  position  should  he  receive  a  security  clearance.  He
currently  works  temporary  jobs.  He  was  unemployed  from:  October  2008-July  2009;
November  2010-December  2010;  November  2011-April  2014;  and  January  2015-
August  2016.  He  served  in  the  military  for  over  20  years,  was  honorably  discharged,
and is receiving a monthly pension in the amount of approximately $655. He is a high
school  graduate.  He  is  single,  has  never  married,  and  has  no  children.  (Tr.  6,  21,  23;
GE 1; AE A)
The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns
for  the  following  years:  2008-2010,  2012-2014  and  2017.  It  also  alleged  that  he  owed
federal  taxes  in  the  amount  of  approximately  $21,000.  He  admitted  in  his  response  to
interrogatories,  his  Answer,  and  his  hearing  testimony  not  timely  filing  his  federal  tax
returns for those years and owing federal taxes. (Tr. 24-27, 30-31; GE 2-3; Answer)
Applicant  attributed  his  tax  problems  to  two  factors.  First,  he  claims  he  was
homeless  for  a  number  of  years  and  that  during  that  time  he  only  was  able  to  secure
“odd  jobs.”  Second,  he  acknowledged  that  he  was  “a  little  bit  irresponsible”  in  dealing
with his tax issues. He documented that for tax years 2008-2010, he filed his tax returns
in March 2012. He did not owe federal taxes for those years. For tax years 2012-2014,
he filed  his  tax  returns  in  May  2016.  He  owed  approximately  $350 in  federal taxes for
2012. For tax year 2017, he filed his tax return in March 2019. He did not owe federal
taxes for that year. Applicant’s large tax debt is attributable to tax year 2006, in which he
owed  approximately  $15,000  in  taxes  that  he  has  been  unable  to  pay.  Over  time,
including interest and penalties, that amount has grown larger.  (Tr. 30-31; GE 2-3; AE
B-C, H-S)
Over  the  past  two  years,  Applicant  claims  that  he  paid  his  tax  debt  in  cash
directly  to  the  local  IRS  office.  He  did  not  provide  receipts  of  those  payments.  The
record  remained  open  until  October  11,  2019  to  allow  Applicant  to  produce  additional
evidence of any cash payments, but he failed to do so. His documentation with the IRS
shows  that  in  March  2016,  the  IRS  agreed  to  accept  $162  monthly  payments  from
Applicant.  He  did  not  provide  documentation  of  making  any  of  those  payments.  In
March  2019,  the  IRS  agreed  to  another  installment  plan  with  him  requiring  monthly
payments of $624 beginning March 25, 2019. Applicant documented that he set up an
undated automatic payment from his bank, but he only showed making two payments,
in  August  and  September  2019  of  $250  each  time,  which  is  less  than  the  installment
agreement called for him to make. He did not provide any other proof of tax payments.
There  is  no  evidence  of  financial  counseling.  His  August  2019  credit  report  shows  no
other delinquent debts. He asserted that if he received his clearance, his expected job
would allow him to pay his tax debt within six months. (Tr. 25-27, 36; GE 3, 5; AE E, G)
