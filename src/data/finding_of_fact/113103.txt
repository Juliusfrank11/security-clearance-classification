In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with very brief comments, nearly all
of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a.
through  1.k.,  and  1.m.  through  1.bb.).  Applicant’s  admissions  and  comments  are
incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the
evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due  consideration  of  same,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving
as  a  registered  nurse  with  her  current  employer  since  February  2018.  She  previously
served as a director of clinic operations for another employer from November 2016 until
December 2017, when her position was eliminated due to budget cuts; and before that,
as an independent nurse contractor from August 2005 until December 2017. A 1987 high
school graduate, Applicant received a diploma in nursing in 1996; an associate’s degree
in nursing in 1999, and a bachelor’s degree in nursing in 2002. She has never served with
the U.S. military. She was married in 1991, and divorced in 2010. She remarried in 2011.
She has two children, born in 1990 and 1992. (Item 3)
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can  be  found  in  the  following  exhibits:  Item  5  (Combined  Experian,  TransUnion,  and
Equifax  Credit  Report,  dated  January  30,  2018);  Item  4  (Equifax  Credit  Report,  dated
February  22,  2019);  Item  7  (Enhanced  Subject  Interview,  dated  September 28,  2018);
Item  5  (Applicant’s  Response  to  the  Interrogatories,  dated  February  22,  2019;  Item  2
(Applicant’s Answer to SOR, dated June 5, 2019); and Item 3 (e-QIP, dated January 10,
2018).
When Applicant completed her January 2018 e-QIP, she acknowledged that she
had filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and 2012; that she had one delinquent automobile loan;
had a lien; and that she had failed to file her federal income tax returns for several tax
years. (Item 3, at 38-47) She was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of
Personnel Management (OPM) in September 2018. During that interview, she discussed
the  above  financial  issues,  but  it  was  only  after  she  was  confronted  with  additional
delinquent accounts  that  she  shared  the facts  associated  with  those  accounts as  well.
(Item 7)
During the trustworthiness eligibility review process, Applicant attributed her failure
to  maintain  her  financial  accounts  in  a  current  status,  as  well  as  her  failure  to  file  her
income  tax  returns,  to  a  variety  of  issues:  her  2010  divorce,  unspecified  medical
emergencies, and her period of unemployment, all leading to insufficient funds. Her failure
to file her multi-year federal income tax returns was attributed to trying to do so without
professional assistance, and subsequent fear of filing because of her failure to file for the
previous  year(s).  (Item  7;  Item  2)  Some  of  the  delinquent  accounts  were  charged  off,
some were sold or transferred to debt purchasers, and one lien was filed. She attributed
her  multiple  bankruptcy  filings  to  legal  advice  that  she  reportedly  received  from  her
attorney. (Item 5)
The SOR alleged the filing of four voluntary petitions for bankruptcy under Chapter
13; unfiled federal income tax returns for the tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014,
2015, and 2016; a federal tax lien; as well as 21 delinquent accounts, including unpaid
federal  and  state  income  taxes,  totaling  approximately  $137,935.  With  respect  to  the
delinquent accounts, Applicant contended that some of  the accounts listed in the SOR
may have already been resolved, and that she had been making monthly payments on
other accounts, but she failed to submit any documents, such as a statement from the
creditor agreeing to a repayment plan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank
register, or receipts,  to  support her contentions.    As to  the federal income tax  returns,
Applicant contended that she had already filed those returns, but once again, she failed
to submit any documentation to support her contention. The SOR allegations are set forth
below:
SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.d.: These refer to Applicant’s repeated filings of voluntary
petitions for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 in September 2012 (dismissed in November
2012); in October 2011 (dismissed in June 2012); in January 2010 (dismissed in February
2012); and August 2009 (dismissed in March 2010). The most recent petition reflected
liabilities  of  approximately  $146,957.  In  each  instance,  the  dismissals  were  ordered
because of Applicant’s failure to make plan payments to the trustee. (Item 6)
SOR ¶¶ 1.e., 1.bb., and 1.cc.: These refer to Applicant’s failure to file her federal
and state income tax returns for the tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and
2016, as well as her failure to pay the respective federal and state income taxes for those
years.  In  her  January  2018  e-QIP,  she  acknowledged  her  failure  to  file  those  federal
income tax returns. (Item 3, at 40-42) However, in her Answer to the SOR, she contended
that  she  had  done  so.  (Item  2)  She  failed  to  submit  any  documents,  such  as  account
tax  returns,  or  any
transcripts,  copies  of
correspondence from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to confirm her contentions. In
addition,  in  her  most  recent  Chapter  13  voluntary  petition,  she  reported  $20,000  in
delinquent federal income taxes and $17,000 in delinquent state income taxes.  (Item 6)
the  reportedly  filed  federal
income
In the absence of the appropriate documentation, the issues regarding the federal  and
state income tax returns, including the nonpayment of taxes, have not been resolved.
There is a legal requirement to file a federal income tax return, and it is based upon
an  individual’s  gross  income  and  other  enumerated  conditions.  Once  it  is  determined,
under 26 U.S.C. § 7203, Willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, that there is an
obligation to so file, the following applies:
Any  person  required  under  this  title  to  pay  any  estimated  tax  or  tax,  or
required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make
a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to
pay  such  estimated  tax  or  tax,  make  such  return,  keep  such  records,  or
supply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations,
shall,  in  addition  to  other  penalties  provided  by  law,  be  guilty  of  a
misdemeanor  and,  upon  conviction  thereof,  shall  be  fined  not  more  than
$25,000  ($100,000  in the  case of a  corporation),  or imprisoned not  more
than 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution. In the case of
any person with respect to whom there is a failure to pay any estimated tax,
this  section  shall  not  apply  to  such  person  with  respect  to  such  failure  if
there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect to such
failure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the
first  sentence  of  this  section  shall  be  applied  by  substituting  "felony"  for
"misdemeanor" and "5 years" for "1 year."
SOR ¶ 1.f.: This refers to a student loan with a total balance of $60,515, of which
$4,361 is past due. Applicant claimed that she had an agreed repayment plan, and that
she was making monthly payments of $447. (Item 7, at 9) However, she failed to submit
any  documents,  such  as  a  statement  from  the  creditor  agreeing  to  a  repayment  plan,
cancelled  checks,  copies  of money  orders, a  bank  register, or receipts,  to  support her
contentions. In the absence of such documentation, I must conclude that the account is
not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.g.: This refers to an automobile loan with a past-due and unpaid balance
of $20,066 that was charged off. Her monthly payments were $642. Applicant claimed
that  the  loan became delinquent  in  2016.  (Item  5,  at 9;  Item  4,  at 2;  Item 7,  at  6)  She
indicated that because the loan has a very high interest, she intended to pay it off first.
(Item 7, at 6) She failed to submit any documents, such as a statement from the creditor
agreeing to a repayment plan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register,
or  receipts,  to  support  her  contentions.  In  the  absence  of  such  documentation,  I  must
conclude that the account is not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.h., 1.o., 1.p., 1.r., 1.t., 1.u., 1.w., and 1.y. through 1.aa.: These refer to
various medical accounts with unpaid balances of $2,202, $509, $485, $247, $242, $205,
$174,  $169,  $169,  and  $121  for  which  Applicant  has  not  made  any  resolution  efforts.
(Item 4, at 2; Item 5, at 11-14; Item 7, at 6-9) These accounts are not yet in the process
of being resolved.
SOR  ¶¶  1.i.  and  1.k.:  These  refer  to  two  bank-issued  credit-card  accounts  with
unpaid balances of $845 on one account that was sold to a debt purchaser; and $366 on
the other account for which $543 was charged off in March 2016. (Item 5, at 8; Item 4, at
2) Applicant admitted that she was indebted to the creditors, but contended that she had
been making agreed-upon $75 monthly payments to the first creditor, and had paid off
both accounts on March 1, 2016.  (Item 7, at 10) She failed to submit any documentation,
such as statements from the creditors agreeing to repayment plans, cancelled checks,
copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support her contention that she
had an agreement with one creditor; that she was making any payments to that creditor;
or that either account had been paid off as she had contended. In the absence of such
documentation, I conclude that the accounts have not been resolved, and are not yet in
the process of being resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.j.:  This  refers  to  a  bank-issued  credit-card  of  account  with  an  unpaid
balance of $512 that was sold to a debt purchaser. (Item 5, at 9; Item 4, at 2) Applicant
admitted that she is indebted to the creditor, but failed to explain if she had made any
efforts to resolve the account. This account is not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.l.: This refers to a federal tax lien in the amount of $9,649 that was filed
against Applicant in 2010. (Item 5, at 6) Applicant contended that the lien should have
been resolved before she was interviewed by the OPM investigator in September 2018,
but acknowledged that if it had not already been resolved, she intended to pay it off by
February 2019. (Item 7, at 4) Applicant failed to submit any documentation, such as a
signed  release  of  lien,  cancelled  checks,  copies  of  money  orders,  a  bank  register,  or
receipts, to support her contention that she paid off the lien amount and that it had been
released. In the absence of such documentation, I conclude that the federal tax lien has
not been resolved, and is not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.m.: This refers to a line-of-credit account with an unpaid balance of $2,754
that was charged off. (Item 5, at 8) Although Applicant initially indicated that she had no
knowledge of the account, she subsequently admitted that she is indebted to the creditor.
(Item  7,  at  8;  Item  2)  She  failed  to  explain  if  she  had  made  any  efforts  to  resolve  the
account. The account is not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.n.: This refers to a cellular-telephone account with an unpaid balance of
$768. (Item 5, at 8) Applicant admitted that she is indebted to the creditor. (Item 7, at 4;
Item  2)  She  failed  to  explain  if  she  had  made  any  efforts  to  resolve  the  account.  The
account is not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.q.: This refers  to  an  Internet  account  with  an  unpaid  balance  of $350.
(Item 5, at 11) Applicant admitted that she is indebted to the creditor, but contended that
she had “been making monthly payment arrangements.” (Item 7, at 8; Item 2) She failed
to  submit  any  documentation,  such  as  statements  from  the  creditor  agreeing  to  a
repayment plan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts,
to support her contention that she either had an agreement or that she was working on
such an agreement; or that she was making any payments to the creditor. In the absence
of such documentation, I conclude that the account has not been resolved, and is not yet
in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.s.: This refers to an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance
of $243. (Item 5, at 12) Although Applicant initially indicated that she had no knowledge
of the account, she subsequently admitted that she was indebted to the creditor. She also
stated that she believed the debt had been settled. (Item 7, at 8; Item 2) She failed to
submit any documentation, such as statements from the creditor agreeing to a repayment
plan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support
her  “belief”  that  she  had  settled  the  account.  In  the  absence  of  such  documentation,  I
conclude that the account has not been resolved, and is not yet in the process of being
resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.v.: This refers to an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance
of $175. (Item 5, at 13) Although Applicant initially indicated that she had no knowledge
of the account, she subsequently admitted that she was indebted to the creditor. She also
stated that she believed the debt had been settled. (Item 7, at 7; Item 2) She failed to
submit any documentation, such as statements from the creditor agreeing to a repayment
plan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support
her  “belief”  that  she  had  settled  the  account.  In  the  absence  of  such  documentation,  I
conclude that the account has not been resolved, and is not yet in the process of being
resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.x.: This refers to an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance
of $169. (Item 5, at 13) Although Applicant initially indicated that she had no knowledge
of the account, she subsequently admitted that she was indebted to the creditor. She also
stated that she believed the debt had been settled. (Item 7, at 7; Item 2) She failed to
submit any documentation, such as statements from the creditor agreeing to a repayment
plan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support
her  “belief”  that  she  had  settled  the  account.  In  the  absence  of  such  documentation,  I
conclude that the account has not been resolved, and is not yet in the process of being
resolved.
The most recent report of Applicant’s net monthly income appears in her Voluntary
Petition for Bankruptcy under Chapter 13 filed in September 2012. It was $3,000. She
also  reported  $1,325  in  monthly  expenses.  (Item  6)  It  is  not  known  what  Applicant’s
current financial resources may be because she did not report her current net monthly
income;  monthly  expenses;  and  any  monthly  remainder  that  might  be  available  for
discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. The only evidence
of financial  counseling  was  the  on-line  counseling  she  received  in  connection  with  her
bankruptcy filings. In the absence of additional financial information, it remains difficult to
determine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than she had been.
