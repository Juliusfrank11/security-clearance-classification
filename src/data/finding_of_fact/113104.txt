Applicant,  age  43,  is  married  with  three  minor  children.  His  youngest  child,  age
10,  has  special  needs.  He  earned  a  Bachelor  of  Science  degree  in  2015.  He  has
maintained steady full-time employment since at least September 2006. He also had a
part-time  job  for  an  unspecified  period  of  time  in  2009.  He  has  been  employed  as  an
aircraft mechanic by a defense contractor since December 2010.  He served honorably
in  the  Air  Force,  from  1999  through  2005,  and  in  the  Air  National  Guard,  from  2005
through  2011.  He  was  previously  granted  a  security  clearance  in  1999.  His  last
background  investigation  occurred  in  about  2011  or  2012.  (Item  4  at  18;  Item  6  at  3;
Item 7 at 1-2)
Applicant  accrued  30  delinquent  debts  after  a  2010  chapter  7  bankruptcy
discharge  (SOR  ¶  1.a),  including  a  $14,782  car  loan  account  (SOR  ¶  1.b),  15  federal
student loan accounts totaling $52,405 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c – 1.q), a $296 credit-card account
(SOR ¶ 1.r), a $256 satellite-television account (SOR ¶ 1.x), and 12 medical accounts
totaling $2,819. (SOR ¶¶ 1.s – 1.w and 1.y – 1.ee). (AE D; Items 8 and 9)
Applicant  resolved  the  delinquent  status  of  all  15  student-loan  accounts  by
consolidating them in February 2019. As of June 2019, he was current with his monthly
payment  of  $67,  and  had  a  remaining  balance  of  $48,815.  In  June  2017,  Applicant
claimed  to  have  arranged  to  pay  $50  per month  to  resolve  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶
1.b,  but  he  never  submitted  either  evidence  of  actual  payments  made  or  a  plan  to
otherwise resolve the debt. In his SOR answer, Applicant articulated a reasonable basis
to dispute the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.x, but did not provide substantiating documents.
In  his  FORM  response,  he  acknowledged  that  debt  and  proffered  a  plan  to  repay  it
along with the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.r and the 12 medical debts. He did not proffer a
reasonable  basis  for  the  dispute  noted  on  his  August  2019  credit  report  of  the  $123
medical  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.d.  His  unresolved  SOR  debts  total  $18,153.  (FORM
response; SOR answer; AE A; AE D at 70; Item 6 at 6; Item 10 at 2-4, 6-8)
Applicant attributed the 2010 bankruptcy to his and his wife’s unemployment. He
filed the petition in October 2009, claiming liabilities of $200,637, including student-loan
accounts  totaling  $90,381.  He  received  the  credit  counseling  required  by  the  court  in
2009. Except for the student-loan accounts, his debts were discharged in January 2010.
(Item 6 at 3 and 5; Item 7 at 3; Item 11)
Applicant  asserted  that  his  inability  to  resolve  the  student-loan  debts  and  the
accumulation  of  new  debts  after  the  bankruptcy  discharge  were  caused  by  his  wife’s
voluntarily  unemployment  to  care  for  their  special-needs  child  full  time,  their  complete
financial  support  of  his  wife’s  parents,  and  the  extraordinary  medical  expenses
associated  with  their  child’s  special  needs.  He  also  acknowledged  that  he  prioritized
saving funds for a 20% down payment on a home that was purchased in May 2017. The
details of that purchase were not specified in the record. (AE B; Item 6 at 3 and 5; Item
7 at 3)
During  his  November  2018  SI,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  was  still  struggling
financially.  However,

circumstances  to  which  he  attributed  his  financial  problems  or  any  details  associated
with  his  relevant  income  and  expense  history.  The  Government  enumerated  various
deficiencies  in  Applicant’s  mitigation  evidence  and  advised  him  of  the  opportunity  to
address  those  deficiencies  and  submit  supporting  documentation  in  his  FORM
response. However, Applicant did not fully avail himself of that opportunity.
timeline  for
In his FORM response, Applicant stated the following in support of mitigation: 1)
he  lives  within  his  means  and  does  not  spend  frivolously;  2)  his  current  debts  include
one  credit  card  ($22/month  payment,  $750  balance), an  almost  paid-off  car  loan  for  a
13-year-old  car  with  200,000  miles  ($191/month  payment,  $695  balance),  and  one
personal loan he used to repair that car to keep it running ($325/month payment, $2,015
balance);  3)  his  wife  assumed  their  home-mortgage  debt  following  their  “recent
separation;”  4)  he  attended  financial  planning  classes  at  his  church  and  developed  a
“Dave  Ramsey”  repayment  plan  to  resolve  his  delinquent  debts  in  “baby  steps”  by
paying them off from smallest to largest; and 5) he established a budget with a timeline
to repay certain creditors. (AE D at 4-6)
Applicant’s  credit  report  dated  August  2019  revealed  a  $64  utility  debt  (which
appeared on a January 2018 credit report, but was not alleged in the SOR) and six new
medical  debts  totaling  $1,883.  In  his  FORM  response,  Applicant  proffered  a  plan  to
repay  the  utility  debt,  but  did  not  specifically  address  the  new  medical  debts.  The
Government also did not allege two medical debts totaling $514 from a July 2019 credit
report. I will consider any debts not alleged in the SOR only to evaluate mitigation and
the whole-person concept. (AE D at 63, 66-69, 71-72; Item 8 at 20; Item 10 at 2)
Applicant’s pastor, a retired military officer who commanded at the battalion level,
has  known  him  for  over  10  years.  He  corroborated  that  Applicant  does  not  live  above
his  financial  means  or  spend  frivolously.  He  is  certain  that  Applicant  is  loyal  to  his
country and his employer. (AE C)
