In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and
1.d.  He  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  1.c,  and  1.e-1.h.  His  admissions  in  his
answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 32-year-old linguist employed by a defense contractor since June
2018.  He  was  born  in  Afghanistan.  After  his  father  was  killed,  his  family  fled  from
Afghanistan in 1997 to escape from the Taliban. They lived in Pakistan for about three
years and then came to the United States in July 2001. Applicant attended high school in
the  United  States  from  August  2003  to  June  2006,  and  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in
December 2007.
Applicant has never married and has no children. He has three brothers, ages 29,
26, and 23. (Tr. 44.) When he is not deployed overseas, he lives in a rental home with his
mother and his youngest brother. (Tr. 32.)
Applicant attended a university in the United States from August 2006 to May 2010,
but did not receive a degree. He worked as a linguist for a defense contractor and was
deployed to Afghanistan from September 2010 to January 2012, and his gross income
was about $11,400 per month during this deployment. (Tr. 42.) He used his income to
support his mother and his three brothers, who were all in college at the time. (Tr. 43-44.)
After  Applicant  returned  from  Afghanistan,  he  and  a  friend  (a  Marine  Corps  veteran)
started a  business,  but  it  failed  after about  six  months.  (Tr. 43.)  He  worked  for a non-
government employer for one month as a cultural role player. He was unemployed from
March  2012  to  March  2013.  He  worked  for a  U.S.  Government  agency  as  a  seasonal
employee from April to July 2013. He was unemployed from August 2013 to March 2014.
He was self-employed part time as a driver for a ride-sharing company from April 2014 to
July 2016, while he was in college. He worked for a defense contractor as a cultural role
player for one month in the spring of 2016.
Applicant completed college and received a bachelor’s degree in May 2016 and
was unemployed until he found part-time and intermittent work in the non-federal sector
from November 2016 to June 2018. His annual income during this period was less than
$30,000. (Tr. 36.) He has worked for defense contractors since June 2018. He has never
held a security clearance.
At  the  time  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  had  been  deployed  to  Afghanistan  since
March  2019.  He  came  to  the  United  States  for  his  hearing  and  then  returned  to
Afghanistan. (Tr. 30-31.) While in Afghanistan, he frequently deploys to remote areas for
long periods, without access to email, and documents sent by postal service take 10-15
days  to  reach  him.  The  limited  email  and  postal  service  make  it  difficult  for  him  to
communicate with creditors. (Tr. 10-11.) He intends to enlist the assistance of his brothers
in  communicating  with  creditors.  His  current  contract  expires  in  March  2020,  and  he
expects it to be renewed as long as there is a continuing need for linguists. (Tr. 64-65.)
The  SOR  alleges  eight  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $25,000.  The  evidence
concerning the debts in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: credit-card account referred for collection of $7,957. Applicant fell
behind on his payments  in 2016 because  of  his limited  income. When  he  reduced  the
amounts  of  his  payments,  the  interest  increased.  He  contacted  the  creditor  but  was
unable  to  reach  an  agreement.  (Tr.  48.)  The  creditor  sued  him  in  December  2018.  In
Applicant’s SOR answer, he stated that he was contesting the amount of this debt and
that  a  court  hearing  was  set  for  June  24,  2019.  Applicant’s  attorney  failed  to  appear,
apparently due to miscommunication about the dates of Applicant’s deployment, and a
default judgment was entered. Applicant contacted the court clerk and obtained the forms
to request that the case be reopened for a hearing. However, he has not filed the motion
to reopen the case, because the hearing would be within 60 days after the motion is filed
and Applicant will still be in Afghanistan. He intends to file the motion upon his return to
the  United  States.  (AX  F;  AX  J.)  If  the  debt  is  not  otherwise  resolved,  he  intends  to
negotiate a payment plan. (Tr. 50.)
SOR ¶ 1.b: student loan referred for collection of $6,013. Applicant began a
rehabilitation program in September 2018 and made $5 payments by automatic debit from
his account from October 2018 through June 2019. He has completed the rehabilitation
program for this loan. His new payments have not yet been determined. (AX A; AX H.)
SOR ¶ 1.c: credit-card account referred for collection of $890. After obtaining
this credit card, Applicant disputed the annual fees, to which he had not agreed, and the
issuer  removed  the  annual  fees.  After  Applicant  closed  the  account,  the  fees  were
reinstated.  When  Applicant  learned  that  a  default  judgment  had  been  entered  against
him, he requested a hearing and appeared in court. (GX 14 at 21.) On June 8, 2018, the
collection agency’s lawsuit was non-suited. (AX K.)
SOR  ¶  1.d:  credit-card  account  charged  off  for  $823.  In  Applicant’s  SOR
answer, he stated that he believed the account had been paid off and closed and that he
would contact the creditor and resolve it. As of the date the record closed, it was not yet
resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.h: medical bills referred for collection of $631 and $649.
These  debts  arose  when  Applicant  thought  he  had  food  poisoning  and  went  to  the
emergency  room.  He  did  not  have  health  insurance.  (GX  14  at  22;  Tr.  58.)  He  made
payment agreements for these bills and made the final payment on one of them in May
2019 and the other in June 2019. The debts are resolved.  (AX C through E and AX G.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g: student loans referred for collection of $5,587 and $2,235.
Applicant began a rehabilitation program for these loans on September 25, 2019, and has
made the first payment. (AX I; AX H.)
In Applicant’s post-hearing submission, he provided a list of his current revolving
credit accounts. His documents reflect that all his credit-card accounts are current and in
good standing. (AX F; AX L through O.) His current gross income is about $74,000 per
year.  Now  that  his  siblings  have  completed  their  education,  they  provide  most  of  their
mother’s financial support. His net monthly remainder is about $4,000, which he believes
is sufficient to enable him to enter into payment agreements for his unresolved debts. (Tr.
59-62.) He has never sought or obtained financial counseling. (GX 14 at 22.)
Applicant’s  team  commander  in  Afghanistan,  an  Army  major,  submitted  a  letter
recommending  that  his  application  for  a  security  clearance  be  granted.  (AX  P.)  His
comments include the following:
[Applicant] is an incredible linguist and has provided direct positive impacts
to our mission in a very forward, and often dangerous environment. He has
proven to be one of the most effective linguists I have worked with in my
three  deployments  to  Afghanistan.  His  cultural  understanding  of  both
American and Afghan culture makes him an invaluable asset. Because of
the  close  interaction  and  demonstrated  commitment  to  our mission,  I  am
writing you to strongly support [Applicant] and recommend him for a secret
clearance.
