Applicant, age 43, has been in a relationship analogous to marriage since 2015.
His was previously married from 2000 through 2008. He has three minor children and one
adult child. He served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1994 until 1996, when
he was discharged due to medical injuries. His Department of Veterans Affairs disability
rating  is  30%.  He  received  a  high  school  diploma  in  1994,  and  attended  community
college from 2008 through 2012. He has been employed full time as a material rigger by
a defense contractor since April 2018. He reported no prior security clearances.
Applicant  admitted  each  of  the  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  totaling  approximately
$56,402 including: a $17,868 child support account (SOR ¶ 1.a), six federal student loan
accounts totaling $28,434 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b – 1.f and 1.h), 22 medical accounts totaling $3,659
(SOR ¶¶ 1.k – 1.ff), a $3,321 automobile loan account (SOR ¶ 1.g), a $1,698 personal
loan  account  (SOR  ¶  1.i),  and  one  $1,422  retail  charge  account  (SOR  ¶  1.j).  While
Applicant reported no periods of unemployment, he attributed his financial indebtedness
to a period beginning in 2016 when his income was reduced due to the lack of availability
of  full-time  hours  and  continuing  through  a  2018  layoff.  In  November  2018,  Applicant
reported that he was gainfully employed and had “the means” and willingness to resolve
his delinquent debts. He also claimed numerous actions that had either been taken or
would be taken to resolve his delinquent debts. (Item 1 and 3).
Applicant’s  child  support  debt  resulted  from  an  arrearage  owed.  The  record  is
unclear as to which child or children it relates, or to what financial issue it can be attributed
because  Applicant  provided  inconsistent  explanations  between  his  SCA,  SI,  and  SOR
Answer.  In addition  to  an  ongoing  voluntary  wage  garnishment,  in 2016  and  2017,  his
federal tax returns were garnished and applied to repay the debt. Without providing any
substantiating documents, he claimed that the balance had been reduced to “$10,000 or
less” as of April 2019, and that the wage garnishment had been “consistently” paid during
the past eight to ten years. (Item 1 at 5, Item 2 at 35, Item 3 at 10, Item 4 at 3).
Applicant’s  student  loan  accounts  were  opened  in  2011  and  2012.  They  were
placed in deferment status in 2018 and rehabilitated as of April 2019. As of May 2019,
the accounts were reported as no longer in delinquent status. (Item 1 at 5-6, Item 3 at 9-
10, Item 4 at 4-5, Item 5 at 4-5).
During his November 2018 SI, Applicant stated that his medical debts were being
consolidated and would be paid in full. The record does not specify on whose behalf or
the reason these debts were incurred. In his May 2019 SOR Answer, he stated that he
was “getting in contact” with his creditors to resolve the accounts in phases, ranging from
“within the next month” to “by the end of this year.” (Item 1 at 6-8, Item 3 at 5-9; Item 5 at
1 and 2).
Applicant’s  automobile  loan  account  resulted  from  a  voluntary  repossession
following a blown engine. He financed the vehicle in 2014 for $5,202. The account was
charged off in 2017 in the amount of $3,321. Applicant believed that the creditor resold
the vehicle and acknowledged “an amount owed,” but did not specify it. Applicant took on
a  $10,825 personal loan  with  the  same  creditor  in  2014. The  loan was  to  be  repaid  in
$257  monthly  payments  over  48  months.  The  account  was  charged  off  in  2017  in  the
amount of $1,698. During his November 2018 SI, Applicant stated that he was working
with the creditor to pay both debts. In his May 2019 SOR Answer, he stated that he was
“getting in contact” with the creditor to set up a payment plan to resolve both debts by the
end of the 2019. (Item 1 at 5 and 6, Item 3 at 9, Item 4 at 5).
Applicant opened a retail charge account in 2014 with a $1,000 credit limit. The
account was charged off in 2017 in the amount of $1,422. During his November 2018 SI,
Applicant stated that he was willing to pay this debt. In his May 2019 SOR Answer, he
stated that he had been in contact with the creditor who offered a settlement and planned
to pay the debt by the end of the 2019. (Item 1 at 6, Item 3 at 9, Item 4 at 6, and Item 5
at and 5).
