Applicant, 28, has worked for a federal contracting company as a mechanic since
March  2018.  He  completed  a  security  clearance  application,  his  first,  in  May  2018.  In
response  to  the  questions  about  his  financial  history,  Applicant  disclosed  three
delinquent  accounts.  The  ensuing  investigation  confirmed  and  the  SOR  alleges
Applicant  owes  $25,536  on  three  delinquent  accounts  and  that  he  owes  another
charged-off  account  for  an  unspecified  amount.  Applicant  admits  that  he  owes  the
accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c and that ¶ 1.d is a duplicate of ¶ 1.b. The
credit  reports  in  the  record  tend  to  support  this  assertion.  Accordingly,  SOR  ¶  1.d  is
resolved in Applicant’s favor. (GE 3-5.)
Applicant  attributes  his  financial  problems  to  three  periods  of  unemployment
between July 2009 and May 2018. These periods of unemployment were not caused by
events  beyond  Applicant’s  control.  He  was  unemployed  between  August  2013  and
December 2014  to  attend  school full  time. He  was  unemployed  between  August  2016
and November 2016 after deciding to take some time off. He also  took two months off
before starting his current position in March 2018. Due to the loss of income, Applicant
could not afford to meet his financial obligations for the three vehicles he owned. In his
answer to the SOR, he claims to have made payment arrangements for the vehicle debt
alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b,  but  he  did  not  provide  any  corroborating  evidence.  While  he
admits  the  amounts  owed  in  paragraphs  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  and  1.c,  he  points  out  that  the
debts are more than five years old. All of the accounts remain unresolved. (GE 4, 6.)
