I have incorporated Applicant’s admissions to the allegations set forth in SOR ¶¶
1.a-1.f and 1.i-1.n in my findings of fact. I have also considered his notation in his SOR
response that the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.f and 1.i-1.n were included in his 2019
Petition.  Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  GE  3,  his  SCA,  unless
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, the Government’s FORM, and the documentary evidence in the
record, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 42 years old and has married twice and divorced twice. Since 2009,
he has lived with his domestic partner. They have one child, age 7. He graduated from
high  school  in  1995.  He  has  worked  full  time  as  a  transportation  officer  for  a  state
correctional facility since 2006. In 2017, he began working part time as an armed security
guard  for  his  security  clearance  sponsor.  He  is  also  an  employee  of  an  ambulance
company. He has worked with that company for a number of years, but has chosen not
to  work  any  hours  at  that  job  since  2017.  He  is  a  first-time  applicant  for  a  security
clearance.
Applicant’s partner lost her full-time job in 2015. Since then, she has been looking
for a full-time job, but has only worked at part-time jobs causing her annual income to be
reduced from about $33,000 to about $11,000. Applicant claims that this loss of income
has caused him to be unable to pay a number of his debts, which are listed in the SOR
and  discussed  below.  As  a  result  of  his  financial  situation,  Applicant  filed  the  2019
Petition. As noted below, the petition seeks the discharge of the debts listed in the SOR
among other debts. In his petition, he claims that his income is about $2,600 per month
and his expenses are about $3,100 per month and that the total amount of his unsecured
debts is about $47,000. (SOR 1.c) (GE 8 at 1; GE 5 at 12.)
Applicant has a long history of financial difficulties. In 2001, he filed a petition for
bankruptcy under Chapter 7 and successfully discharged his debts. The record does not
contain any information regarding the amount of the debts discharged. (SOR 1.b) (GE 4
at 3.)
Applicant admits the following debts:
SOR  ¶  1.c  –  Debt  owed  to  a  credit  union  in  the  amount  of  $11,012  on  a
deficiency  following  repossession  of  a  motorcycle  –  This  account  was  opened  in
2009 when Applicant purchased a motorcycle. He defaulted on the loan in 2012, and the
motorcycle  was  repossessed.  Applicant  owes  a  deficiency  of  $11,012  following  the
creditor’s resale of the collateral. In his 2019 Petition, he lists the amount of the debt as
$22,643. He has provided no information regarding the discrepancy. This debt is included
in the bankruptcy. (GE 5 at 26; GE 7 at 2.)
SOR ¶ 1.d – Debt in the amount of $11,449 owed on a repossessed vehicle –
In 2011, Applicant borrowed $12,162 to buy a 2001 vehicle. He defaulted on the loan in
2013, and the vehicle was repossessed and eventually resold. He remains responsible
for the deficiency in the amount of $11,449 and other charges. In his 2019 Petition, he
lists the amount of the debt as $6,253, which is the same amount appearing in GE 7, the
most recent credit report in the record. This debt is included in the bankruptcy. (GE 5 at
32; GE 6 at 3; GE 7 at 2.)
SOR ¶ 1.e – Debt in the amount of $3,465 owed on a second repossessed
vehicle  –  Applicant  purchased  this  2004  vehicle  in  2014.  Applicant  defaulted  on  the
vehicle in early 2015. According to his SCA, he defaulted in October 2016 because “a
member of his household,” presumably his partner, lost her job. The debt has been the
subject of a garnishment of Applicant’s wages. This debt is included in the bankruptcy.
(GE 3 at 29-30; GE 5 at 25; GE 6 at 3; GE 7 at 2.)
SOR  ¶  1.f  –  Credit-card  account  charged  off  in  the  amount  of  $408  –This
account was opened in 2014 and he defaulted on the debt in 2015. This debt is included
in the bankruptcy. (GE 5 at 27; GE 6 at 3; GE 7 at 2.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.i through 1.n – Six delinquent debts owed on communications and
medical  accounts.  Applicant  is  indebted  on  collection  accounts  originally  owed  to  a
cellphone service provider (SOR ¶ 1.i for $722) and to two TV entertainment providers
(SOR ¶¶ 1.j for $431 and 1.l for $202) and on three medical collection accounts (SOR ¶¶
1.k, 1.m and 1.n for $234, $$95, and $47, respectively). In his SOR response, he wrote
that all six debts were included in his 2019 bankruptcy petition. Four of the six accounts
are  listed  in  the  2019  Petition.  The  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.j  and  1.l  for  TV
entertainment accounts are not readily apparent on the list of unsecured creditors in the
2019  Petition,  but  are  likely  listed  under  the  names  of  different  collection  agencies  or
consolidated with other debts. (GE 5 at 27, 28, 33; SOR response at 2.)
Applicant denies and disputes the following debts in his SOR response:
SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.h, and 1.o – Disputed debts – Applicant disputes three alleged
debts in his SOR response. He claims he paid in or about August 2015 the debt for $365
he owed to a bank, which is the subject of SOR ¶ 1.g. He writes that he is paying off the
debt of $771 owed to a furniture store, which is alleged in SOR ¶1.h, and that the balance
as of the date of his May 2019 SOR response was $107. He also asserts that he has a
payment arrangement to pay the debt of $312 owed for personal property taxes, which is
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.o, to pay $25 per month and as of May 2019, he only owed about $75.
He provided no documentation to support his claims. (SOR response; GE 2 a 2; GE 8 at
4.)
Aside from his 2019 Petition, Applicant offered no evidence regarding his debts.
His  employment  at  two  jobs  to  pay  his living  expenses  provides some  evidence  of  his
character. By failing to respond to the FORM, he has provided no bankruptcy records or
other evidence updating the status of his case. His petition states that he received credit
counseling from an approved credit counselling agency within six months of the filing of
the petition. (GE 5 at 9.)
