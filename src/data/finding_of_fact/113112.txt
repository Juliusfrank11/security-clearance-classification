Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges the following financial allegations:
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  allege  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  and  state
income tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2016. Applicant said that his failure to timely
file his tax returns was “on me. I’m a procrastinator. I can’t argue that point, so I didn’t file
the taxes. I have been working with [the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)] as my exhibits
show.” (Tr. 20)
Applicant did not file his state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 to
present. (Tr. 20-22, 37) However, he suggested he may have filed a tax return for one of
those tax years over the 2012 to 2018 period. (Tr. 37) He did not know which tax year
he may have filed a tax return. (Tr. 37) He lacked the documentation for some years to
file his tax returns. (Tr. 22) He did not know how much he owed the IRS. (Tr. 23)
The IRS notified Applicant that he had tax debts for tax years 2012 and 2016. (Tr.
33-34) On October 3, 2018, Applicant paid the U.S. Treasury $1,151 for tax year 2012.
(AE B at 2) On June 11, 2019, Applicant paid the U.S. Treasury $3,400 for tax year 2016.
(AE B at 1) He is waiting for the IRS to send him tax bills for other tax  years. (Tr. 34)
When the IRS files substitute tax returns for him and sends him a tax bill, he pays the
IRS. (Tr. 38) He has not received any bills from the state for delinquent taxes. (Tr. 38)
Applicant did not indicate whether the IRS provides IRS-generated substitute tax return
information to state tax authorities.
SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h allege Applicant has six medical debts placed
for  collection  for  $65,566,  $645,  $540,  $450,  $292,  and  $60.  Applicant  had  two  heart
attacks, and he received surgery. (Tr. 23-24) He said he paid about $5,000 to $8,000 over
the  previous  six  years  to  address  the  medical  debts.  (Tr.  26)  He  did  not  provide
documentation such as receipts showing any payments of medical debts. In the past two
years he has paid about $6,000 for prescription medications. (AE A)
In 2019, Applicant had a suspected heart attack; however, it turned out not to be
a heart attack. (Tr. 25) He was transported to the hospital with a helicopter. (Tr. 23-25)
On October 25, 2019, a medical creditor wrote Applicant and offered to accept monthly
payments  of  $453  beginning  when  the  agreement  is  signed.  (AE  A)  According  to  the
agreement, the payments were supposed to be made until the $13,587 debt was paid in
full. (AE A) The agreement was not signed and dated. (AE A) Applicant’s insurance did
not pay for the helicopter transportation to the hospital because the insurance company
decided it was not medically necessary, and/or he lacked prior approval. (Tr. 25) Applicant
said he was disputing his responsibility for the debt. (Tr. 25) He said he was willing to
start making a $300 monthly payments. (Tr. 40)
Since 2017, Applicant went to Jamaica about seven times for five to seven days
for  each  trip.  (Tr.  35)  In  2019,  Applicant  went  to  Jamaica  for  six  or  seven  days  for  a
vacation. (Tr. 34) He also traveled to Costa Rica twice. (Tr. 36)
In  conclusion,  Applicant  conceded  that  he  has  not  filed  tax  returns  for  several
years, and he had a large number of medical debts. (AE A) Nevertheless, his credit score
is “ok.” (AE A) He was able to purchase a used vehicle this year at a reasonable rate and
secure a mortgage to buy his home at a low interest rate. (AE A) He worked diligently for
