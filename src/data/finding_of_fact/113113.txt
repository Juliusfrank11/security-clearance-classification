Applicant, age 34, is unmarried with one minor child. She earned her high school
diploma in 2003. She has been employed by a defense contractor since April 2019. She
was previously granted security clearances; by the DOD in 2010, and by an unspecified
agency in 2018.
Between  2011  and  2018,  Applicant  incurred  the  11  delinquent  debts  alleged  in
the  SOR,  which  totaled  $43,417.  In  her  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  but  one
$515 medical account  (SOR ¶ 1.k),  of  which  she  claimed  to  have  no  knowledge.  That
debt was not only confirmed by a 2017 credit report, but she previously acknowledged it
as a hospital bill incurred in 2010 when she did not have the funds to pay it. (Items 4, 6;
Item 5 at 7)
Applicant  attributed  her  debts  primarily  to  extended  periods  of  unemployment
including: 1) June 2018 through April 2019; 2) September 2014 through June 2015; and
3) February 2010 through June 2011. She also extended her credit on behalf of persons
who did not pay the creditors as they had agreed, which resulted in the debts alleged in
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h. (Items 2, 3, 5)
Applicant  asserted  that  she  made  monthly  payments  of  $200  toward  resolving
the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e, beginning on a date not specified in the record until she
became  unemployed  in  June  2018.  However,  she  did  not  provide  any  corroborating
1  The  record  evidence  suggests  that  Applicant  completed  another  SCA  prior  to  the  one  generated  in
January 2019. However, the earlier SCA was not included in the record. The SOR is based on concerns
raised  by  the  January  2019  SCA.  Thus,  the  earlier  SCA  not  being  included  in  the  record  did  not  affect
either the relative positions of the parties or my decision. Nevertheless, I mention it to avoid any confusion
in the record.
evidence.  Her  credit  reports  reflected  a  reduction  of  merely  $98  in  the  balance  owed
between March 2017 and January 2019. (Item 3 at 50; Item 4 at 4; Item 6 at 4)
In  June  2019,  Applicant  engaged  the  services  of  a  company  to  assist  her  with
“getting  some  derogatory/frivolous  items  removed  from  her  credit  file.”  Those  services
cost her $88 per month. However, the record does not specify how much, if any, of that
monthly fee is being used to repay her creditors. Nor did Applicant specify whether she
received financial counseling, either from the company or otherwise. (Item 2; AE A, C)
After an  investigation by  one  of  the  credit bureau agencies  in August  2019,  the
debts alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b and SOR ¶ 1.j were removed from Applicant’s credit report.
Conversely, the agency affirmed the validity of the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c.
Applicant proffered no bases for disputing of any of these four debts. (AE C at 3, 4)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b was a loan for a car originally owned by Applicant.
She gave the car to a friend who agreed to assume responsibility for repaying the loan.
When  the  friend  could  no  longer  afford  the  loan  payments,  the  car  was  repossessed.
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j was the final bill generated when Applicant cancelled her
cable service. The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a was a loan for a car Applicant owned. The
car  was  repossessed  after  she  defaulted  on  the  loan  due  to  unemployment.  Without
providing any corroborating evidence, she asserted that any balance owed on the loan
was resolved after the creditor resold the car. The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c was a car
loan  that  she  cosigned  for  another  individual.  When  that  individual  defaulted  on  the
loan, the car was repossessed. (AE C at 3; Item 2 at 1-2; Item 5 at 6, 8; Item 3 at 46-47,
50-51)
In June 2019, Applicant paid $186 towards the debt alleged in SOR  ¶ 1.i. As of
August  2019,  the  remaining  balance  was  $437.  In  September  2019,  she  arranged  to
resume  monthly  payments  of  $100  to  resolve  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.d.  She  did
not,  however,  provide  evidence  that  any  payments  were  actually  made.  Since  about
August  2019,  she  has  been  making  bi-monthly  payments  via  an  involuntary  wage
garnishment (20% of her paycheck) to satisfy a June 2018 judgment granted in favor of
the  creditor  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.e.  As  of  September  2019,  she  owed  a  remaining
balance of $922. (AE B, C, D; GE 7; Item 2 at 4)
The  record  did  not  specify  Applicant’s  relevant  income  and  expense  prior  to
August  2019.    In  August  2019,  she  reported  a  monthly  net  remainder  of  $1,295.
However, that number did not include unspecified expenses for her “daughter’s needs,”
which  she  asserted  renders  her  salary  insufficient  to  address  her  debts.  Recognizing
the security concern raised by her debts, she began seeking part-time employment. Her
part-time job search efforts had been unsuccessful as of October 2019. (Item 2 at 3-4;
FORM response)
Applicant’s  debt  resolution  plan  includes  making  unspecified  payments  on  the
22nd  day  of  each  month  to  the  creditors of her admitted  debts, one  by  one, until they
are  fully  resolved.  Her  plan  requires  her  to  maintain  her  full-time  employment  and  to
supplement her income with a part-time job. She believes this approach is the best way
to  ensure  that  she  remains  able  to  meet  her  ongoing  living  expenses.  The  plan  is  on
hold, in part, because of the garnishment and, in part, because her creditors have asked
for good-faith deposits in amounts larger than she can afford. Once the garnishment is
satisfied,  she  will  work  on  amassing  the  requested  deposits.  She  anticipated  that  the
garnishment would be completed by about mid-November 2019. (Item 2 at 3-4; FORM
response)
At the close of her FORM response, Applicant stated the following:
I can say that I made some very poor judgments with my credit, and have
learned my lesson from helping people when it comes to my credit. I was
young,  moved  away  from  home,  and  did  not  think  about  how  me  not
paying  things  on  time  or  at  all  would  affect  me  in  the  long  run.  I  also
understand now that I am older how important my credit is, in life and also
how important it is to maintain and keep my clearance and my occupation.
I  am  trying  my  best  to  fix  my  credit  .  .  .  I  can’t  take  care  of  my  debt
overnight. [sic]
