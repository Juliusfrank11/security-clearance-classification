Applicant is a 35-year-old software engineer for a defense contractor. He seeks a
security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are
adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant has never married and has no children. (GE 1) He earned a high school
diploma  in  September  2013.  He  attended  classes  at  an  accredited  university  between
September  2013  and  June  2018  and  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  computer
engineering in June 2018. (GEs 1-2) He reported no military service.
Between June 2016 and June 2018, Applicant worked for a defense contractor as a
part-time summer intern. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 25-26) Since June 2018, he has been employed
as  a  full-time  software  engineer  with  special  concentration  in  projects  for  future
simulations, as well as projects that address radio signal systems.  (GE 2 and AE B; Tr.
19) Previously (June 2014-December 2014), he worked for two employers as a resident
advisor  and  summer  intern,  respectively.  (AE  B)  As  a  resident  advisor,  he  developed,
maintained,  and  coordinated  social  living  conditions  for  his  university.  And,  while  a
summer  intern  for  a  local  utility  firm,  he  tested  his  firm’s  satellite  web  page.  (AE  B)
Applicant  was  denied  an  interim  security  clearance  in  2016  while  he  was  a  summer
intern, with no reasons given. (GE 1; Tr. 19, 32)
Applicant’s drug history
Between  January  2013  and  November  2018,  Applicant  used  marijuana  with
varying frequency. Altogether, he used marijuana about 20 times during this period.  (GE
2)  Marijuana  is  classified  as  a  Schedule  I  controlled  substance  under  the  Federal
Controlled  Substance  Act,  and  as  such,  its  manufacture,  use,  possession,  and
distribution  is  federally  regulated.  In  the  electronic  questionnaires  for  investigations
processing  (e-QIP),  Applicant  completed  in  November  2016,  he  admitted  his  use  of
marijuana  in  social  situations  “less  than  a  dozen  times”  between  January  2013  and
August 2016. (GE 1)
In a follow-up personal subject interview (PSI) with an investigator of the Office of
Personnel  management  (OPM  in  August  2018,  Applicant  increased  his  estimated
marijuana use “to a total of approximately 20 times” from his first use in January 2013 to
his last use in August 2018. (GE 2) And, when asked in a subsequent PSI convened in
December 2018 to update  his first and  last use of  marijuana  and  other  drugs between
January 2013 and December 2018, he confirmed his recreational  use of marijuana with
his  mother  in  August  2018.  (GE  2  and  AE  E;  Tr.  20,  26-27)  Asked  to  respond  to
interrogatories  propounded  by  the  government  in  April  2019,  he  expanded  his  use  of
marijuana with his mother to include additional use in November 2018. (GE 2) Accepted
are  his  assurances  that  he  has  not  used  marijuana  since  his  last  admitted  use  of  the
substance in November 2018 (a period of less that nine months).
While Applicant has provided prior assurances that he will not use marijuana or any
other  illegal  drugs  in  the  future,  his  intentions  are  tempered  by  his  recurrent  use  of
marijuana  in 2018 with full notice  of  the anti-drug policies in effect by the  DoD and  his
employer.  (GEs  1-2;  Tr.  27,  30)  Before  accepting  his  internship  with  his  employer  in
2016, he was explicitly notified of the DoD’s anti-drug policy. (Tr. 25-26)
Notice  of   the   DoD’s  anti-drug  policy  was  further  impressed   upon  Applicant  by  the
questions asked of him about drug use in the e-QIP he completed in 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 25-
27)  With  this  imputed  notice,  he  told  the   OPM  investigator  in  his  December   2018   PSI
interview   that  he  had   no  intent  to  use  marijuana   in  the   future.  (GE  2)  Believing  that
marijuana   is   legal  under  his  state’s  controlling  law,  he  twice  resumed  his  use  of
marijuana  with his mother in November 2018 and  continues  to socialize with his mother
and other persons who use marijuana, albeit out of his presence.  (GE 2; Tr. 26, 30-31)
In his updated PSI interview of December 2018, Applicant was asked if he had ever
misused non-prescribed medications. (GE 2) After initially answering no to the question,
he was confronted with his misuse of prescription drugs. (GE 2) Once confronted by the
OPM investigator, Applicant admitted to using Adderall not prescribed to him twice with
friends  for  recreation  purposes  in  August  2018.  In  his  answers  to  interrogatories
propounded  by  the  government  in  April  2019,  he  expanded  his  use  of  Adderall  not
prescribed to him to include his use of Adderall not prescribed to him in November 2018.
Accepted are his assurances that he has not used marijuana or Adderall not prescribed
to  him  since  his  last  admitted  use  of  Adderall  in  November  2018.  More  recently  in  his
hearing testimony, Applicant increased his recollected use of non-prescribed Adderall to
five occasions in 2018. (Tr. 28-29)
Applicant continues to socialize with friends who use non-prescribed Adderall, but
assured  that  he  has  not  returned  to  using  the  drug  since  his  last  admitted  use  in
November 2018. (GE 2) He has no plans to resume his use of the drug in the future due
to his employment concerns. (GE 2 and AE D)
Endorsements
Applicant is well-regarded by his manager, former classmates, family. (AEs C and
E)  Former classmates who have remained good friends describe him as honest, highly
responsible,  trustworthy,  reliable,  and  hard-working.  (AE  E)  They  recount  the  many
instances  where  he  has  prioritized  helping  his  classmates  over  resting.  (AE  E)
Applicant’s former classmates who have known him for many years ((one of whom is in a
current romantic relationship with him) credit him with doing so much for his friends and
family while being a role model for those around him. (AEs A and E) Acknowledging their
awareness  of  his  clearance  situation,  they  believe  his  past  mistakes  are  more
compensated  by  his  contributions  to  his  work,  friends,  and  family.  (AEs  A  and  E)
Nonetheless, because his mother shared marijuana with him on at least two occasions in
2018, it is unclear at this point what positive influence she may choose to impose  on him
in his future efforts to sustain his committed abstinence.
Applicant received solid performance evaluations for calendar year 2018. (AE C)
He  received  excellent  ratings  in  each  of  the  rated  categories:  knowledge,  skills  and
ability;  problem  solving,  discretion/latitude,  and
interrelationships  with  staff  and
customers.  He is credited by his manager with being an overall excellent performer who
has demonstrated strong leadership with personal integrity in his company relationships
and in his conforming to company standards. (AE C)
