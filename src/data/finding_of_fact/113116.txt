In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with extensive comments, all of the
factual  allegations  pertaining  to  financial  considerations  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  through  1.d.).
Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration
of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
in an unspecified position with his current employer since November 2018. He previously
served as a precision measurement equipment laboratory (PMEL) technician with another
government  contractor  from  May  2006  until  September  2015.  In  September  2015,  his
employer lost a particular contract, and Applicant was laid off. Between his 2015 layoff
and  his  current  position,  Applicant  held  several  relatively  brief  part-time  and  full-time
positions, separated by periods of unemployment.
Applicant  enlisted  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force,  and  served  on  active  duty  from  March
1986 until September 1991, when he was honorably discharged. He then served in the
inactive reserve from May 1991 until December 1993. He received an associate’s degree
in 1988 and a bachelor’s degree in 1991. He has held secret, top secret, or “Q” clearances
during various periods since 1986. He was married in 1983, and divorced in  1997. He
remarried in 1999, and was divorced in 2003. He has three children, born in 1986, 1988,
and 1991.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can
be found in the following exhibits: Item 8 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax
Credit Report, dated July 27, 2018); Item 9 (Equifax Credit Report, dated February 14,
2019);  Item  3  (Enhanced  Subject  Interview,  dated  August  17,  2018);  Item  3  (Subject
Contact, dated August 29, 2018); Item 5 (1993 Bankruptcy File, filed March 1, 1993); Item
6 (1999 Bankruptcy File, filed July 14, 2009); Item 7 (2018 Bankruptcy File, filed March
22, 2018); Item 2 (SF 86, dated July 9, 2018); and Item 1 (Applicant’s Answer to SOR,
dated July 1, 2019).
In his SF 86, Applicant listed his bankruptcy, filed in March 2018, under Chapter
13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. He estimated that from about January 2008 until August
2017, he had incurred gambling losses of $20,000. He added the following comments:
Although my gambling issues are not as severe as they have been several
years ago due to the fact that I have been working on this issue and slowly
progressing  in  a  positive  manner.  I  do  gamble  once  in  a  while  but  less
frequently and less amounts in the present (sic).
I have banned myself for life from the two closest casinos near me which
has helped me tremendously. I have also had the help of my son that lives
with me as encouragement to not go to any casino, and has accompanied
me to a casino to help me control what I do while I am there if there is free
play and to spend minor amounts. I am continuing to work on this issue as
I  will  continue  to  work  on  this  the  rest  of  my  life.  The  difference  in  now
compared  to  several  years  ago  is  how  frequent  I  go  and  the  amounts  I
spend if I go. I feel like even with this issue it has not affected my ability to
perform  my  jobs  that  I  may  have  had  while  holding  and  maintaining  a
clearance.  I  have  also  used  legal means  to handle  any  financial  issues  I
may have had during those times. I have never engaged in illegal activities
while  holding  a  clearance.  I  have  always  worked  hard  to  maintain  my
finances and live a straight life, but I am human. Once again, I believe any
financial problems I may have had while holding a clearance or not holding
a clearance has not affected my duties or obligations to the United States
of America.
(Item 2, at 40)
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): In August 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from
the  U.S.  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM),  and  during  the  interview,  they
discussed Applicant’s gambling habits. Applicant claimed that he started going to casinos
in January 2008, and he mainly played the slot machines and poker. He generally went
to  the  casinos  up  to  four  times  per  week,  and  started  his  wagering  at  $20  per  night,
increased to $100 each night, and on about five occasions, his entire $900 pay check. In
an effort to curtail his gambling habits, he voluntarily had himself banned from two of the
three local casinos. Applicant gambled for an escape and a means of relieving stress.
Although he denied that gambling negatively impacted his work, he admitted that he was
tired at work after being at the casino late the evening before work, and that on some
occasions, he would take leave from work to rest. He acknowledged that his gambling
affected  his  family  life  because  his  sons  may  have  felt  envious  that  he  was  spending
money on gambling rather than giving it to them.
Applicant acknowledged that he does not go to the casino every day, but that when
he is at the casino, it is hard for him to leave. He does better when he has a companion
at the casino who can help him leave. Furthermore, since he filed for bankruptcy in 2018,
he does not gamble as frequently because he does not have money to do so, and he has
to drive 50 miles to the nearest casino from which he is not banned. Although he agrees
that he may have had an “addiction” to gambling, he no longer believes that he has an
addiction, and considers it more of a “habit.” He has never sought counseling or treatment
for his gambling, but has done some research on the Internet regarding coping strategies.
If he felt  his gambling  was  out  of  control to cope  with,  he  would  voluntarily  seek  help.
Applicant intends to not go to casinos any more, and if his financial status improves, he
will try to abstain from going to casinos or by going less often. (Item 3, at 7)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  filed  for  bankruptcy  on  three  occasions,  in
March 1993; July 2009; and March 2018. It also alleged that his financial problems are
the result of his gambling habits, and that he continues to gamble at casinos, despite his
ongoing financial difficulties.
(SOR  ¶  1.c.):  On  March  1,  1993,  Applicant  and  his  wife  filed  a  joint  voluntary
petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7, not Chapter 13, as erroneously alleged in the
SOR. Because there were no reported assets, an unspecified amount of liabilities was
discharged on June 14, 1993, and the case was terminated on June 17, 1993. (Item 5)
Although Applicant admitted the allegation, he noted that he was under the impression
that the bankruptcy was actually under Chapter 7, but he could not recall the specifics of
the bankruptcy. (Item 1)
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): On July 14, 2009, Applicant filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy
under  Chapter  13.  He  listed  nearly  $159,300  in  liabilities,  including  nearly  $79,000  in
creditors  holding  secured  claims  (a  timeshare,  two  mortgages,  county  taxes,  and  a
vehicle); nearly $3,000 in creditors holding unsecured priority claims (attorney fees); and
nearly $78,000 in creditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims (credit cards and charge
accounts). He estimated that his net monthly income was nearly $3,900; and his average
monthly  expenses  were  nearly  $3,100,  leaving  him  approximately  $800  available  for
discretionary  spending  or  savings.  Applicant  claimed  that  his  2007  income  from
employment was nearly $56,500; his 2008 income from employment was nearly $58, 500;
and his 2009 income from employment at the time of the filing was nearly $31,000. He
also reported two additional sources of income during 2007: $1,440 and $11,200 from
gambling.  It  was  determined  that  Applicant  had  available  nearly  $450  in  monthly
disposable income. Although the available exhibit does not include a bankruptcy trustee’s
report,  and  there  is  no  indication  as  to  payments  made  to  creditors,  an  unspecified
payment plan was confirmed in September 2009, and the debtor was discharged on June
11, 2014. The case was terminated on August 8, 2014. (Item 6) Applicant contended that
he paid the trustee about $50,000, or $800 per month over a period of five years, and that
he relinquished a house worth about $59,000. (Item 1)
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): Less than four years after his 2009 bankruptcy was discharged, on
March 22, 2018, Applicant again filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter
13.  He  listed  nearly  $64,900  in  liabilities,  including  nearly  $11,500  in  creditors  holding
secured claims (a vehicle); nearly $4,200 in creditors holding unsecured priority claims
(attorney fees, and federal and state income taxes from the 2017 tax year); and nearly
$49,300 in creditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims (credit cards, charge accounts,
and medical accounts). He estimated that his net monthly income was nearly $2,200; and
his  average  monthly  expenses  were  nearly  $1,900,  leaving  him  approximately  $300
available for discretionary spending or savings. Applicant claimed that his 2016 income
from  employment  was  nearly  $37,000;  his  2017  income  from  employment  was  nearly
$33,900;  and  his  2018  income  from  employment  at  the  time  of  the  filing  was  nearly
$3,500.  He  also  reported  additional  sources  of  income  during  2016:  $7,440  from
unemployment;  and  for  2017:  $4,500  from  gambling.  It  was  determined  that  Applicant
had available nearly $300 in monthly disposable income. Under the approved Bankruptcy
Payment Plan, Applicant was to make total payments of $18,300, or monthly payments
of $305, to the trustee for a period of 60 months. The payment plan was confirmed in May
2018. (Item 7; Item 4)
Applicant contended that he started making his monthly $305 payments on April
21, 2018, and that he has made those payments now for over one year. (Item 1) However,
he failed to submit any documents, such as cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a
bank register, receipts, allotment authorization, or an updated report from the Bankruptcy
Trustee, to support his contentions that payments are being made.
On August 21, 2018, Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Worksheet. In it, he
reported a $2,442 net monthly income from his position at that time. However, based on
his anticipated new and current position, he modified his estimate upward to $3,058. He
had  $1,703  in  monthly  expenses,  including  the  $305  payments  to  the  trustee;  and  a
monthly remainder of $739 that might be available for discretionary spending or savings.
There is no evidence of a budget. Other than the on-line credit counseling associated with
his bankruptcies, there is no evidence of financial counseling. There is no evidence that
he ever received treatment for his gambling problem.
