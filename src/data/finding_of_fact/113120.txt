In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the delinquent debts alleged in
the SOR. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings
of fact.
Applicant is a 63-year-old database manager employed by a defense contractor
since January 2008. He worked in non-government jobs from January 1999 to October
2007. He was unemployed from October 2007 until he was hired by his current employer.
He received a security clearance in January 2008.
Applicant married in June 1984, divorced in December 2005, and married again in
July 2010. He has a 32-year-old son who is currently incarcerated and three stepchildren,
ages 25, 26, and 28.
Applicant testified that he incurred legal expenses of about $2,500 in April 2014,
when his adult stepdaughter attacked him, was charged with domestic assault, and filed
a  complaint  against  Applicant  for  domestic  assault.  Although  the  stepdaughter’s
complaint  was  dismissed,  Applicant  incurred  legal  fees  defending  himself  against  his
stepdaughter’s  complaint.  The  stepdaughter  no  longer  lives  in  the  household,  and
Applicant has had no contact with her for more than a year. (GX 2 at 7.) He did not provide
any documentation of his legal fees.
Applicant’s son was charged with rape in September 2014. He was convicted in
July 2015, and his appeal of his conviction was not successful. (GX 2 at 5.) Although his
son is an adult, Applicant felt obligated to assist him with his legal expenses. He believes
that his son is innocent. He agreed at the hearing that his decision to help his son was
voluntary and was not a legal obligation. (Tr. 71.) He testified that he spent $15,000 to
$20,000 for legal fees. He and his wife devoted their incomes to pay the legal fees and
used credit cards for living expenses. As the legal fees continued to accumulate, he and
his wife were unable to pay their credit-card accounts. (GX 2 at 7-8; Tr. 53.) Applicant did
not  submit  any  documentation  of  the  legal  fees  for  his  son’s  defense  at  trial  and
subsequent appeal.
Applicant testified that he had medical bills in an unspecified amount for treatment
of prostate cancer in 2013, and his wife incurred medical bills of about $2,500 for arthritis
and  physical  therapy  around  2017.  Finally,  he  testified  that  he  incurred  about  $800  in
unexpected car repairs. (Tr. 55-57.) He provided no documentation of these expenses.
The  SOR  alleges  eight  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $61,380.  In  December
2017, Applicant signed an agreement with a debt-resolution company to handle the debts
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a-1.g. His agreement required him to deposit $1,063 per month into a
“settlement account.” (AX A.) He testified that he terminated this agreement and replaced
it  with  a  debt-negotiation  agreement  with  another  company  in  June  2019.  This  debt-
negotiation  program  requires  Applicant  to  pay  $723  per  month,  and  the  estimated
program length is 53 months. This program is handling the debts alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b,
1.c, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g. (AX B.)
Applicant  testified  that  in  June  2019,  his net  monthly  income  was  about  $6,149
and his expenses were about $2,735, leaving a net monthly remainder of about $679. (Tr.
44-46.) He testified that he expected his income to change because a new company was
taking over the contract under which he was working. (Tr. 44-47.) He also testified that
he had a detailed and accurate income and expense record at home and that he would
submit  it  after  the  hearing.  (Tr.  51.)  However,  he  did  not  present  any  additional
information.
The evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. The
debts are reflected in credit reports from February 2018 and February 2019. (GX 4; GX
5.)
SOR ¶ 1.a: credit-card account charged off for $14,516. This debt was included
in the debt-resolution program but has not been resolved. The creditor filed a garnishment
petition, and a hearing on the petition was scheduled for September 26, 2019, the day
after  the  hearing.  (AX  C.)  Applicant  provided  no  additional  evidence  regarding  the
outcome of the hearing. The debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b: credit-card account charged off for $13,597. This debt was included
in  the  debt-resolution  program  and  the  debt-negotiation  program,  but  it  has  not  been
resolved. In July 2019, the creditor filed a warrant in debt against Applicant. The creditor
sought  to  garnish  Applicant’s  pay  and  the  hearing  on  the  garnishment  summons  was
scheduled for September 26, 2019, the day after the hearing. (AX D.) The hearing was
postponed until October 10, 2019. Applicant testified that he hoped that this hearing would
result in a negotiated settlement rather than a garnishment. (Tr. 64.) Applicant provided
no evidence regarding the outcome of the hearing and no evidence regarding resolution
of the debt.
SOR ¶ 1.c: unsecured loan charged off for $8,185. This debt was included in
the debt-resolution program and the debt-negotiation program. In Applicant’s answer to
the SOR, he provided evidence that the creditor agreed to settle the debt for $5,698 in
October 2018, to be paid through his debt-resolution plan in 11 installments. However, at
the  hearing,  he  testified  that  he  had  terminated  his  contract  with  the  debt-resolution
company,  that  the  debt  was  not  yet  resolved,  and  that  no  further  negotiations  were
underway. (Tr. 59.)
SOR ¶ 1.d: credit-card account charged off for $956. The February 2019 credit
report reflected that the balance on this debt was $4,262 the payments were past due for
$956, and the account was charged off. (GX 4 at 2.) This debt was included in the debt-
resolution program but had not been resolved when Applicant responded to the SOR. In
January 2019, Applicant received an offer to settle the debt for $1,407. (AX E.) There is
no evidence that he accepted the offer. He testified that “some payments” had been made
on the debt, but he submitted no documentary evidence reflecting any payments. (Tr. 59.)
SOR ¶ 1.e: credit-card account charge off for $4,046. This debt was included
in  the  debt-resolution  program  and  the  debt-negotiation  program.  In  August  2018,  the
creditor agreed to settle the debt for $1,718, to be paid in $50 monthly installments until
August  2019  and  $100  installments  thereafter.  (Answer  to  SOR;  AX  G.)  Applicant
submitted evidence of one $50 payment on February 27, 2019. (AX F.) He did not submit
evidence of any other payments.
SOR ¶ 1.f: department store charge account charged off for $3,373. This debt
was  included  in  the  debt-resolution  program  and  the  debt-negotiation  program.  The
original debt was for $4,497. In September 2018, the creditor agreed to settle it for $3,373.
(Answer to SOR) The February 2019 credit report reflects that the debt was charged off
for $3,373. (GX 4 at 2.) In September 2019, Applicant received an offer to settle this debt
for $1,476. (AX H.) There is no evidence that he accepted the offer or made any payments
on the debt. He testified that this creditor was receiving payments from his debt-resolution
company, but he submitted no documentary evidence reflecting any payments. (Tr. 60.)
SOR ¶ 1.g: credit-card account charged off for $771. This debt was included in
the debt-resolution program and the debt-negotiation program. The February 2019 credit
report reflected that the balance on this account was $2,202, that it was past due for $771,
and that the account had been charged off. In May 2019, Applicant received a settlement
offer from the same creditor, but it appears to apply to another debt not alleged in the
SOR, because the account number and the balance due do not match the debt reflected
in the February 2019 credit report. (AX I.) He testified that his debt-resolution company
had  made  “some  payments”  on  this  debt  and  that  the  debt-negotiation  company  was
negotiating with the creditor, but he submitted no documentary evidence  reflecting any
payments or a payment agreement. (Tr. 60.)
SOR ¶ 1.h: time-share account charged off for $15,936. Applicant acquired this
property for $15,000 in September 2015, before his son’s legal problems arose. (GX 3 at
5; Tr. 68.) He cancelled his purchase contract after paying about $1,000. In July 2017, he
hired a credit-repair company to challenge this debt. The debt was cancelled in November
2017 and an IRS Form 1099-C was issued. (AX J.)
