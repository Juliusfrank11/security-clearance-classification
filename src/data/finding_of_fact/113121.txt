Under Guideline  H,  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant used marijuana  with
varying frequency between 1975 and at least November 2016 (SOR 1.a); and that she
used marijuana while on active duty in the U.S. Air Force between 1980 and 2000, and
while holding security clearances during and after her military service (SOR 1.b).
Under  Guideline  E,  it  was  alleged  that  Applicant  intentionally  made  false
statements to the Government in her January 2017 e-QIP by answering “No” to the e-QIP
Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) question asking if she had ever used
illegal drugs while holding a security clearance, as alleged in SOR 1.b (SOR 2.a).
In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  1.a  and  1.b,  but  denied,  with
explanation, SOR 2.a. (FORM, Item 1) In addition to the facts established by Applicant’s
admissions, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  62-year-old  employee  of a defense  contractor,  for whom  she  has
worked since January 2017. She was married from October 1974 until divorcing in May
1984, and she had two children, now adults, from that marriage. After receiving her high
school graduate equivalency degree in December 1979, Applicant joined the Air Force in
January 1980, where she served until retiring in January 2000. (FORM, Item 2)
Applicant held a security clearance while in the Air Force. She also held a security
clearance while working for a federal agency between November 2003 and March 2004,
and while working as a defense contractor in Afghanistan between March 2005 and July
2006. (FORM, Item 2)
As she admitted in response to the SOR, Applicant used marijuana between 1975
and  2016.  She  used  marijuana  while  serving  on  active  duty  in  the  military  and  while
possessing security clearances for both government and federal contractor employment.
In a security clearance application submitted in July 2001, she did not disclose any prior
use of marijuana; however, in an August 2001 subject interview, Applicant stated that she
had used marijuana starting in 1975 and while serving in the Air Force. Applicant also has
undergone  treatment  and  counseling  for  mental  health  problems.  Treatment  records
show that she used marijuana at least in March 2010, July 2011, and September 2014.
When  Applicant  submitted  her  e-QIP  in  January  2017,  she  stated  that  she  only  used
marijuana four to six times a year between April 2009 and November 2016, and that she
purchased small amounts of marijuana in 2016 to use marijuana as a way to deal with
personal stress. In the same e-QIP, she answered “No” to the e-QIP Section 23 question
that asked if she had ever used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance. (FORM,
Items 2 – 7)
