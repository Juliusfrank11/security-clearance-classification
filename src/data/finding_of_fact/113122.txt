Applicant,  age  55,  is  unmarried  without  children.  He  has  resided  with  a
cohabitant  since  2010.  He  earned  a  high  school  diploma  in  1983.  He  has  been
employed as a material coordinator by a defense contractor since August 2017. This is
his first application for a DOD security clearance.
Applicant  has  11  unresolved  delinquent  debts  totaling  $23,786,  including  10
consumer accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.e and 1.g –  1.k) and a $2,140 federal student-loan
account  (SOR  ¶  1.f).  Applicant  claimed  that  he  is  making  monthly  payments  for  the
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.e and 1.g – 1.j. However, he did not specify any details
about  how  much  or  when  he  has  made  such  payments.  Applicant  denied  the  debt
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f, claiming it had been paid in full, and the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k,
without explanation. He did not provide any documents to corroborate his claims. (Item
1 at 4 – 5; Items 4, 5, and 6).
Applicant attributed the accumulation of the alleged debts (except SOR ¶¶ 1.a –
1.c) to his unemployment, although he did not specify which period.  He stated that he
forgot to pay the debts alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b and 1.c and had no excuse for not paying
the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.  He  was  unemployed  most  recently  between  July  2016
and September 2016, after being fired. However, the credit reports reveal that Applicant
fell behind on the most of his debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.h and 1.j – 1.k) between February
2015  and  May  2016,  and  one  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.i)  in  October  2018.  His  prior  periods  of
unemployment included: 1) October 2013 through March 2014, after a layoff; 2) January
2012 through January 2013, after a layoff;  and 3) July 2008 through September 2008,
after a layoff. (Item 2 at 9 – 19 and 34; Item 3 at 2, and 4 – 6; Items 4, 5, and 6).
During  his  August  2018  SI,  Applicant  asserted  that  his  finances  had  improved
since  his  most  recent  employment  in  August  2017  and  that  he  was  working  towards
resolving his delinquent debts. He stated that he was willing and able to repay all of his
debts  and  would  never  experience  financial  difficulties  again.  Between  February  2018
and  an  unspecified  date,  Applicant  paid  15%  of  his  unspecified  salary  to  resolve  a
$7,545  delinquent  federal  student-loan  account  (formerly  SOR  ¶  1.l,  which  was
withdrawn  by  the  Government).  However,  the  record  did  not  otherwise  specify  any
details  about  his  relevant  income  and  expense  history.  Applicant  never  utilized  a  debt
consolidation service, and there is no evidence in the record that he received financial
counseling.  Applicant  expressly  chose  to  resolve  his  debts  directly  with  his  creditors
rather than file for bankruptcy. (Item 1 at 5; Item 3 at 5)
