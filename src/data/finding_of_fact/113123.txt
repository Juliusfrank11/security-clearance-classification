deferment.  She  contacted  the  other  loan  service  providers  to  place  her  loans  in
forebearance. Applicant continued to work as a teacher assistant. This did not provide
sufficient income to pay, and she has a difficult time finding a position in her field that paid
more money.

she was in a head-on motor vehicle accident. Her car was deemed a total loss. She also
received permanent injuries  to her sternum and spine. Although this made it difficult, she

the accident. (Answer to FORM)

graduate degree, Applicant had a total debt of $220,418.90, plus varying interest rates of

the  entire  check  to  the  university.  (AX  A,  attachment  2). When  Applicant  graduated  in
2014, she worked for a federal agency and her student loan remained in deferment. She
also produced a 2014 letter that she wrote to her congressman asking for advice and help
with the student loan. (AX A) The university did not resolve the financial issue and added
a $5,021 fee.
In 2016, Applicant contacted the other loan servicing providers to place her student
loans  in  forebearance  or  loan  forgiveness  because  she  could  not  afford  to  make  a
payment.    She  also  consolidated  the  student  loans  and  asked  for  an  income-driven
repayment plan. (AX A, attachment 4) She stated that the loans were consolidated and
she made a total of $1,400 in payments in 2017 and 2018. (AX A, attachment 5) She had
