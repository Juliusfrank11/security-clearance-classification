In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comments, all of the factual
allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c.), and personal
conduct (SOR ¶ 1.a.). Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.
After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the  evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  a  security  guard  with his  current  employer since  June  2017.  He  is also a  volunteer
firefighter captain. He is a 2008 high school graduate, and received an associate’s degree
in 2010. He was commissioned into either the Army National Guard (ANG) or the Active
Army  Reserve,  and he  served from  October 2010 until September 2014  when  he  was
honorably  discharged  as  a  second  lieutenant.  (Item  2,  at  14-17;  Item  3,  at  4)  He  was
granted a secret clearance on an unspecified date. He was married in 2014, and divorced
in 2016. He has no children.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can  be  found  in  the  following  exhibits:  Item  5  (Combined  Experian,  TransUnion,  and
Equifax  Credit  Report,  dated  August  11,  2017);  Item  6  (Equifax  Credit  Report,  dated
December 4, 2018); Item 3 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated May 2, 2018); and Item
1 (Applicant’s Answer to SOR, dated July 15, 2019).
Applicant  reported  that  he  had  been  unemployed  following  his  discharge  from
military  service,  and  that  period  of  unemployment  extended  from  October  2010  until
September 2014. He was also unemployed from April 2017 until June 2017. During both
periods  of  unemployment,  he  was  supported  by  his  parents,  and  he  spent  his  time
searching  for  a  job.  (Item  3,  at  3-4)  Several  accounts  became  delinquent.  During  his
interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in
May  2018,  Applicant  was  questioned  about  his finances,  and  it  was  only  after  he  was
confronted  with  negative  financial  information  from  his  credit  report  that  he  did
acknowledge  having  delinquent  accounts.  He  attributed  his  financial  difficulties  to  his
unemployment. He stated that he would obtain a copy of his credit report and immediately
contact his creditors to bring all of his delinquent accounts into a current status. (Item 3,
at 5-6)
The  SOR  alleged  three  delinquent  accounts  totaling  approximately  $22,572.
Those  three  accounts  were  an  unsecured  consumer  loan  with  an  unpaid  balance  of
$21,451 for which $21,811 was charged off in February 2013 (Item 5, at 4; Item 6, at 1;
and Item 3, at 6) (SOR ¶ 1.a.); a medical account with an unpaid balance of $442 (Item
5, at 11; Item 6, at 2; and Item 3, at 5) (SOR ¶ 1.b.); and a medical account with an unpaid
balance of $679 (Item 5, at 10; and Item 3, at 6) (SOR ¶ 1.c.). Although Applicant stated
his intention to resolve his delinquent accounts in May 2018  – over one year ago – he
failed  to  submit  documentation  such  as  correspondence  with  his  creditors,  cancelled
checks or money orders, or receipts to reflect that he had either contacted his creditors,
or  made  payments  to  them  in  an  effort  to  resolve  his  delinquent  accounts.  Instead,
Applicant submitted selected screen shots of what he characterized as his credit report
on March 12, 2019, reflecting a credit score of 531; tax-reported income of $31,000; and
zero total debt. (Item 4 – attachments to response to interrogatories) His submission did
not  address  the  specific  accounts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Furthermore,  Applicant  did  not
claim  that  he  had  paid  off  the  accounts  in  question.  In  the  absence  of  more  specific
documentation associated with the specific accounts alleged in the SOR, I conclude that
the accounts are not yet in the process of being resolved.
It is not known what Applicant’s current financial resources may be because he did
not report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder
that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a
budget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of additional financial
information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position
financially than he had been.
Personal Conduct
On July 11, 2017, when Applicant completed his SF 86, he responded to certain
questions pertaining to his financial record found in Section 26. Some of those questions
asked if, in the past seven years, he had defaulted on any type of loan; had bills or debts
turned over to a collection agency; had any account or credit card suspended, charged
off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed; and been over 120 days delinquent on any
debt not previously entered; as well as if he is currently over 120 days delinquent on any
debt? Applicant answered “no” to all of those questions, and certified that his responses
were “true, complete, and correct” to the best of his knowledge and belief. (Item 2, at 35-
36)  In fact,  his  answers were  incorrect,  for Applicant  actually  had  delinquent  accounts
that  clearly  came  within  the  scope  of  the  questions  asked.  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,
Applicant admitted that he had deliberately falsified the material facts in his responses to
the SF 86 inquiries. (Item 1, at 2)
