In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comments, all of the factual
allegations  pertaining  to  financial  considerations  in  the  SOR  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  and  1.b.).
Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and
thorough  review  of  the  evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon due  consideration of  same, I
make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  an  aerospace  technician  with  his  current  employer  since  September  2011.  He
previously worked as a sheet metal mechanic and programmer from January 2005 until
November 2010, and he was unemployed from November 2010 until September 2011.
His educational background was not reported. He has never served with the U.S. military.
He has never held a secret clearance. Applicant has never been married, and he has no
children.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can be found in the following exhibits: Item 2 (Answer to the SOR, dated May 9, 2019);
Item 3 (e-QIP, dated March 28, 2018); and Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated
October 31, 2018).
As of April 17, 2019, Applicant failed to file both his federal and state income tax
returns  for  the  tax  years  2011,  2012,  2013,  2014,  2015,  2016,  and  2017.  (Item  2)  He
attributed  his  inaction  to  being  financially  irresponsible  and  disorganized,  and  he
explained  that  he  had  lost  all  of  his  tax-related  documents.  (Item  4,  at  4-7)  During  an
interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on
October  31,  2018,  Applicant  stated  that  he  is  not  unwilling  or  unable  to  satisfy  his  tax
debts, but he acknowledged that he had not made any progress towards doing so. (Item
4,  at  4-7)  He  also  acknowledged  that  he  did  not  have  an  agreement  with  the  Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) to pay the federal taxes that he may owe. (Item 4, at 4-7) It was
Applicant’s intention to engage the services of an attorney to assist him. (Item 3, at 26-
28; Item 4, at 4-7) To date, Applicant has submitted no evidence to indicate that: he has
contacted the IRS or the state revenue department; he has contacted an attorney to assist
him; or he has filed any delinquent federal or state income tax return.
There is a legal requirement to file a federal income tax return, and it is based upon
an  individual’s  gross  income  and  other  enumerated  conditions.  Once  it  is  determined,
under 26 U.S.C. § 7203, Willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, that there is an
obligation to so file, the following applies:
Any  person  required  under  this  title  to  pay  any  estimated  tax  or  tax,  or
required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make
a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to
pay  such  estimated  tax  or  tax,  make  such  return,  keep  such  records,  or
supply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations,
shall,  in  addition  to  other  penalties  provided  by  law,  be  guilty  of  a
misdemeanor  and,  upon  conviction  thereof,  shall  be  fined  not  more  than
$25,000  ($100,000  in the  case of a  corporation),  or imprisoned not  more
than 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution. In the case of
any person with respect to whom there is a failure to pay any estimated tax,
this  section  shall  not  apply  to  such  person  with  respect  to  such  failure  if
there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect to such
failure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the
first  sentence  of  this  section  shall  be  applied  by  substituting  "felony"  for
"misdemeanor" and "5 years" for "1 year."
There  is  no  evidence that  Applicant  made  any  efforts  to  address  his  delinquent
taxes, despite having made promises in his March 2018 e-QIP and October 2018 OPM
interview that he would do so. It is not known what Applicant’s current financial resources
may be because he did not report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and
any monthly remainder that might be available for discretionary spending or savings.
