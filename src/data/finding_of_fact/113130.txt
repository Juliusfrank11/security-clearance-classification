After considering the FORM as amended, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 59 years old and married with one daughter, age 36. He earned his
associate’s  degree  in  May  1997.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  defense
contractor, since November 2017. (Items 3-4.)
In  May  2013,  Applicant  reportedly  retired  from  his  employment  as  a  service
technician with a telecommunications company after 14 years on the job. He immediately
began working as an instrument technician for a defense contractor (company X) on a U.S.
airbase, and was granted a Secret clearance in October 2013. On March 28, 2014, he
consumed about four beers, apparently planning to be on scheduled leave from work that
day. For some reason not apparent in the record, his vacation plans changed, and he
reported to work for the second shift at approximately 3:30 p.m. Within the hour, he was
required to submit to a random screen for drugs and alcohol. His blood alcohol level tested
at .059% initially and .056% 15 minutes later.  Because his alcohol level exceeded the
company’s  limit  of  .040%,  Applicant  was  sent  home  immediately  pending  review  for
termination under company X’s zero-tolerance policy. Applicant resigned that day, citing
personal reasons, because he was concerned that he would be fired after the employer
completed its investigation. (Items 4, 8-9.)
Applicant began working as a mechanic for his state’s department of transportation
in March 2014. He left that job in January 2016 for a better-paying job as a mechanic in the
commercial sector. In August 2017, he resigned because of “too much travel time,” and
began working for his state in maintenance at a state park. After only a month, he was
offered a position with his current employer at a nearby airbase. (Item 3.)
On September 18, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a
Questionnaire  for National Security  Positions  (SF 86) incorporated  within  an e-QIP. In
response to section 13A concerning employment activities, Applicant listed his various jobs
since  January  1999,  including  with  company  X.  He  gave as the reason for leaving his
employment  with  company  X  that  he  “needed  daytime  job  due  to  family.”  Applicant
responded “No” to an inquiry concerning whether, in the last seven years, he had been
fired, quit after being told he would be fired, left by mutual agreement following charges or
allegations of misconduct, or left by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory
performance. Applicant listed in response to the police record inquiries that he had pled no
contest to a misdemeanor driving under the influence (DUI) charge in May 1986. He also
disclosed  two  debts  totaling  $10,000  (SOR  ¶¶  2.e  and  2.p)  in  response  to  inquiries
concerning any routine delinquencies in the last seven years, and explained that he was
trying to earn more income to pay his creditors. (Item 3.)
Applicant owed several more delinquencies than the two debts disclosed on his SF
86.  His  delinquent  accounts,  as  reported  by  one  or  more  of  the  three  credit  reporting
agencies on September 22, 2017 (Item 5), April 18, 2018 (Item 6), and March 26, 2019
(Item 7), and as discussed during his May 15, 2018 subject interview (Item 4) are shown in

On May 8, 2018, and on May 15, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized
investigator for the  Office  of  Personnel Management  (OPM).  During  his first interview,
Applicant  reported  a  history  of  social  drinking  starting  in  his early  20s.  He  denied  any
consumption of alcohol to excess since his 1986 DUI, which he described was an isolated
incident due to his youth and immaturity. He reported drinking three or four beers once or
twice a month since May 1983, becoming intoxicated no more than once a month. While
he had consumed four beers over about three hours’ time before reporting to work on
March  28,  2014,  he  did  not  then  believe  that  he  had  alcohol  in  his  system.  When
confronted with his negative response to the SF 86 questions asking whether he had quit a
job after being told he would be fired or whether he had left a job under mutual agreement
following allegations of misconduct, Applicant stated that he had hoped to find a day-shift
job to assist his spouse with her medical needs before then volunteering that he would not
have resigned if he had not failed a random test for alcohol. He admitted that he should
have answered “Yes” to the SF 86 inquiry, but asserted that he was under the impression
at the time that because he had resigned, company X would not complete an investigation
and his employment record would not show that he had resigned for failing the test. He
then admitted that he had not fully detailed the reasons for his resignation on his SF 86
because he feared the information would affect his ability to maintain a security clearance.
When later discussing the personal conduct implications of his negative response to the
employment inquiry on his SF 86, he claimed he answered as he did because he did not
know for certain that he would have been fired. (Item 4.)
During his May 8, 2018 interview, Applicant acknowledged the delinquencies on his
credit record except for the $7,891 charged-off installment loan (SOR ¶ 1.p), which he did
not  recognize.  He  volunteered  that  some  creditors  had  pursued  court action;  that  one
creditor  filed  a  lien  against  his  property;  and  that  he  had  consulted  with  a  bankruptcy
attorney in late 2017, but was advised that his current income was too high to file for a
Chapter 13 [sic] bankruptcy. He expressed a desire to pay his creditors in full. He indicated
that he did not know where to start with respect to resolving his delinquent debts. Applicant
attributed his financial problems to having to pay for medical insurance for his spouse after
he quit his job in March 2014; to his income from March 2014 to November 2017 being
about half of what it had been previously; and to his spouse’s unemployment for medical
reasons. (Item 4.)
During his May 15, 2018 interview, Applicant explained that he and his spouse used
credit  cards  to  cover some financial obligations.  He identified those creditors who had
obtained default judgments against him. He expressed an intention and plan to contact his
creditors and make payments at $50 a month, with the exception of the judgment debts
(SOR ¶¶ 2.d and 2.k) where he was under court order to pay $200 per month toward each
debt. He estimated his monthly expenses at $2,270, and indicated that he would have
$180 in discretionary income if he made his payments to his creditors. He explained that if
his creditors refused to accept his planned payments, he would seek counseling through a
bankruptcy court. The OPM investigator gave Applicant five days to provide receipts for
payments  on  the  judgments.  (Item  4.)  There  is  no  evidence  that  he  provided  any
documentation of repayment. As of March 2019, the charged-off balances were still being
reported on his credit record as past due.
Applicant was arrested for public intoxication on approximately June 26, 2019. He
pled no contest and paid a fine of $370. In self-reporting the incident to his employer on
July 2, 2019, Applicant explained that he and his spouse argued after he arrived home
from work around 11:30 p.m. on June 25, 2019; that his spouse left the house; that he
drove around looking for her without success throughout the night; that around 8:00 in the
morning, he stopped at a friend’s home, and he was given “part of a 12-pack” of beer and
told to go home. He stated that he consumed one part of a beer before stopping off at fuel
station where he drank another can of beer at the pump.  The police were called. After
taking a field sobriety test, he was arrested for public intoxication and taken to the county
jail where he paid a $370 fine. (Item 9.) Applicant now recalls the incident as occurring on
June 24, 2019. He presented no documentation clarifying the date or corroborating his
account of the circumstances of his arrest.
