The SOR alleges in 1.a-1.b that Applicant failed to file as required, Federal income
tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016 and failure to file, as required, state income tax
returns for tax years 2015 and 2016. (Item 1, 3, and 4) Applicant admitted the allegations
listed  on the  SOR.  He    noted  in his answer to  the  SOR, that  he failed  to file his 2014
income tax returns. (Item 2)
Applicant provided various reasons for not filing his income tax returns, to include,
that he prefers filing every three years, but in this case, he lost track of the years that he
filed. He blamed immaturity and not being organized, but stressed that he is now mature
and takes full responsibility for his actions. Applicant stated that it will not occur again.
(Item 2)
On Applicant’s 2017, security clearance application he stated that he would file by
the end of that year. He noted that he was going through hard times financially, but he
did not elaborate. He stated that he paid his property taxes. He estimated that he owed
about $750 total for his income tax. (Item 3) For the year 2016, Applicant stated on his
SCA that he never received his W-2 tax return in the mail, but believed he owed about
$1,000. (Item 3) During his subject interview, Applicant also acknowledged failure to file
the required income tax returns, but would do so by the end of 2018. (Item 4) He stated
that his financial situation was “pretty good,” as he has a higher paying job.
Applicant responded to the FORM and provided updated information about filings
with respect to SOR 1.a and 1.b. He recently submitted his income tax returns for the tax
years 2014-2018. He spoke to an IRS specialist and stated that he did not understand
why the 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 were filed “all at once” through a third party. He knew
that it was urgent to file his federal and state taxes after reading the subject interview and
the effect on a security clearance.  (Answer to FORM AX A) Applicant submitted client
copies of Federal income tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and  2016. The copies
were signed by the tax preparer on July 22, 2019, but they were not signed by Applicant.
He also submitted the state income tax returns for the same years. The record is not clear
if the returns were actually filed or if the tax owed was paid. (AX A)
Applicant also submitted information concerning his property tax payment and his
current credit score. He stated that he has also paid four collection accounts that were
recently on his credit report. (AX A) There is no information in the record concerning his
salary, financial counseling, or use of a budget.
