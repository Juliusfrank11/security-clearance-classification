In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted all the allegations. Her admissions
in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 27-year-old ship insulator employed by a defense contractor since
January 2018. She graduated from high school in June 2010 and attended college from
December 2010  to  April 2011,  but did not  receive  a  degree.  She worked  at  numerous
non-government jobs until she was hired by her current employer. Applicant earned about
$12 per hour in her previous jobs, but her pay increased to about $21 per hour when she
began working for a defense contractor. She has never married and has no children. She
has never held a security clearance.
After  graduating  from  high  school,  Applicant  initially  lived  with  her  mother  and
drove her mother’s car. She moved back and forth between her mother’s home and her
grandmother’s  home  because  of  her  mother’s  drug  problems.  She  moved  into  an
apartment with a roommate in November 2011. She moved back with her grandmother
in September 2017 and was living with her grandmother when she submitted her security
clearance application. She was living in her own apartment when she was interviewed by
a security investigator in November 2018.
Applicant incurred substantial debts when she bought furniture for her apartment
and  purchased a  car from a private  seller,  which  turned out  to  be a  “lemon.”  She  was
unable to recoup any money from the seller, but she was liable for the loan she obtained
to purchase the car. She was unable to pay for the furniture she purchased, and the seller
garnished her pay. She was unable to pay her state income taxes of about $755 for 2014
and  about  $100  for  2016.  She  also  owed  city  property  taxes  on  her  car,  which  she
neglected to pay because she was accustomed to driving her mother’s car and depending
on her mother to pay the taxes. At the time of the hearing, she was driving a nine-year-
old car with mileage of more than 124,000 miles, for which she owed about $12,000.
Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in July 2018, because her pay
was being garnished by the furniture dealer, making it impossible for her to pay her current
bills.  (Tr.  24.)  She  completed  the  required  credit  counseling  as  soon  as  she  filed  her
petition.  Her  Chapter  13  plan  was  confirmed  in  September  2018.  The  tax  debts  are
included  in  the  bankruptcy  as  priority  debts  that  will  be  paid  first.  The  plan  requires
Applicant to pay $500 per month.
Applicant acknowledged at the hearing that she appeared to have decided to file
the  bankruptcy  petition  after  she  filed  her  application  for  a  security  clearance.  She
explained that she had contacted a bankruptcy attorney and began the process earlier in
the year, but that the petition was not filed until July 12, 2018, about a month after she
applied for a security clearance. (Tr. 22.)
In  March  2019,  the  bankruptcy  trustee  filed  a  motion  to  dismiss  the  bankruptcy
because it was underfunded in light of the amounts claimed for federal, state, and local
taxes and her auto loan. The payment plan was modified and confirmed in June 2019.The
modified plan retained the provision for monthly $500 payments but extended the duration
of the payment plan. (GX 6.)
Applicant has been making payments since October 2018. She missed a payment
in  November 2018  and  paid  less  than  the full  amount  in  December 2018  and  January
2019,  but  she  made  up  the  shortfall  by  increasing  the  payments  for  February  through
April 2019. (AX A.) She testified that she fell behind on her payments because she was
in her first year on the job and was not paid for the days when the shipyard was shut down
for the holidays. (Tr. 26.)
At  the  time  Applicant’s  bankruptcy  plan  was  approved,  her  net  monthly  income
was about $3,091 and her monthly expenses were about $2,591, leaving a net monthly
remainder  of  $500,  the  amount  she  is  required  to  pay  the  bankruptcy  trustee.  (GX  6,
Bankruptcy Schedule J at 34.) She received a pay raise in April 2019. (Tr. 41.) She usually
works six days a week, and her pay sometimes increases when she works more overtime.
If  she  is  granted  a  security  clearance,  she  will  be  eligible  for  positions  of  greater
responsibility and increased pay. (Tr. 22, 40.)
