The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the May 13, 2019 SOR, Applicant
owed  delinquent  debts  totaling  $14,859  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.j)  on  ten  accounts.  Applicant
admitted  the  debts  when  he  answered  the  SOR  allegations.  He  indicated  that  a  $749
collection debt (SOR ¶ 1.a) had been brought current; that he would pay a $105 cable-
services debt (SOR ¶ 1.f) first; and would “slowly knock off each [of the other] debts one at
a time.” After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcripts, I make the following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 36-year-old high school graduate. He has been working for a defense
contractor  as  a  mechanical  technician  since  June  2017.  He  held  an  interim  secret
clearance until it was withdrawn on issuance of the SOR. He does not currently hold a
security clearance. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 29-30.) Applicant believes his employment will continue if
he is not granted security clearance eligibility, but that his opportunity for advancement will
be hampered without a clearance. (Tr. 30.)
Applicant and his longtime girlfriend have lived together since March 2002. (GE 1.)
They have two sons ages one and four. (GE 1; Tr. 28.) Applicant and his girlfriend lived
with his mother until September 2012. It is unclear whether Applicant was employed for the
two years following his high school graduation in June 2002. Applicant worked full-time in
electromechanical assembly for a video systems company from June 2004 to June 2007
and then as a contractor for another company until August 2008, when the contract ended.
Applicant was unemployed from August 2008 to April 2009. (GE 1.)
In  April  2009,  Applicant  began  working  full  time  as  an  assembler  and  machine
operator for a  technology  company.  In  November 2012,  Applicant  purchased  a home,
obtaining  a  mortgage  loan  of  $235,653,  then  to  be  repaid  at  $1,946  per  month.  He
struggled  to  make  his  mortgage  payments  and  stopped  paying  on  some  credit-card
accounts in 2013 and 2014. After he was laid off from his job of five years in May 2014,
Applicant  was  unemployed  until  November  2016.  (GE  1.)  He  was  supported  by  his
girlfriend, who works as an administrative assistant. She supplemented her income at that
time by doing nails for clients out of their house (Tr. 58), but several accounts went unpaid.
(GEs 2-3.) Applicant had convinced his mother to take out a $100,000 home-equity loan to
invest in a car dealership business started by one of Applicant’s cousins. Applicant decided
to  work  for  his  cousin  so  that  he  could  monitor  his  mother’s  financial  investment.
Applicant’s cousin failed to pay him any income, even though he had been promised a
paycheck of $300 a week. Applicant finally decided to look for a job elsewhere. (Tr. 39-42.)
In June 2016, Applicant obtained a loan of $25,532 for a 2012 model-year truck.
The loan required repayment at $472 per month (SOR ¶ 1.a). (GE 4; Tr. 33.) The truck is
currently Applicant and his spouse’s only vehicle. (Tr. 33.)
On November 15, 2016, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86) for a job as a wire-bonder with a company contracted to provide services
for Applicant’s current employer. On the SF 86, Applicant indicated that his employment
was  contingent  on  obtaining  an  interim  secret  clearance.  He  disclosed  no  issues  of
potential security concern on his SF 86. (GEs 1-2.)
A  check  of  Applicant’s  credit  on  March  23,  2017,  revealed  several  outstanding
delinquencies, including credit-card judgment debts of $1,870 from October 2014 (SOR ¶
1.d) and $1,129 (SOR ¶ 1.e) from June 2015. His joint mortgage loan was $7,970 past due
on a balance of $216,704 (not alleged). Credit cards had been charged off for $6,945 in
March 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.b), $829 in February 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.g), and $231 in July 2014 (SOR
¶ 1.h). A cellular phone debt of $216 from April 2015 had also been charged off (SOR ¶
1.i). A credit-card debt of $1,915 from April 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.c) was placed for collection in
March 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.c). A $442 wireless phone debt from April 2011 was assigned for
collection in December 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.j). A $105 cable services debt from December 2014
was placed for collection in December 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.f). (GE 3.)
Applicant  had  no  record  of  late  payments  on  an  automobile  loan  obtained  for
$20,646 in September 2011. He used his credit to buy a vehicle for his mother, and she
gave him the money to make the $348 monthly payments. (GE 3; Tr. 53.) The car loan was
paid off in September 2017. (GE 4.)
In June 2017, Applicant began working for his current employer. (GE 2.) On August
20,  2018,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  an  authorized  investigator  for  the  Office  of
Personnel  Management  (OPM).  While  discussing  his  financial  situation,  Applicant
volunteered that he had several outstanding bills and collection accounts that he had not
disclosed on his SF 86 because he did not have the information needed to accurately
report the accounts. He did not dispute the adverse information on his credit record when
confronted, but could not recall details of the collection accounts. Applicant indicated that
he  brought  his  mortgage  loan  up  to  date  in  October  2017  and  was  making  timely
payments. He claimed that the old cell phone debt with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.i had been
paid off. As for the charged-off debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d, 1.g, and 1.h, Applicant
acknowledged them as his credit-card debts, which he hoped to pay off by the end of 2018.
Applicant  recognized  the  two  credit-card  judgment  debts,  which  he  likewise  hoped  to
resolve by the end of 2018. Applicant explained that, after he was laid off in 2014, he
turned to credit cards to pay for necessities and “slowly fell behind.” His intention was to
sell his home in the next six months and pay off his delinquent debts. He had not sought
financial  counseling,  but  his  financial  situation  was  improving  because  of  his  full-time
employment.  The  investigator  reportedly  gave  Applicant  the  opportunity  to  provide
documentation  about  his  delinquent  accounts  during  and  after  his  interview,  but  no
documentation was submitted. (GE 2.)
Applicant’s girlfriend took time off from her job as an administrative assistant around
the birth of their second son in 2018. She returned to work, but only about 20 hours a
week, because her shift job was no longer available. (Tr. 33.)
In November 2018, Applicant and his girlfriend moved into a condominium. He was
behind on his electricity bill for his previous residence and has been paying extra to reduce
his delinquent balance. (Tr. 47-48.) No information was provided about the extent of his
utility delinquency or his extra payments.
In December 2018, Applicant paid off his mortgage loan by selling his house. (GE 4;
Tr. 43-44.) Of his $75,000 in equity from the home sale, he gave his mother $70,000 to
repay  her  for  the  $100,000  she  lost  in  the  car  dealership  investment  that  he  had
encouraged. He deposited the remaining $5,000 in his savings account. (Tr. 45.)
As of January 2019, Applicant was $749 past due ($17,967 balance) on the truck
loan  obtained  in  June  2016  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  In  2017,  he  redeemed  the  truck  from
repossession after being chronically late 30 to 60 days in his payments. (GE 4; Tr. 32.)
Equifax was reporting no progress toward resolving the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.f and 1.h.
(GE 4.) The $216 and $442 cell phone debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.i-1.j) were not on his credit report,
but they had not been paid. (Tr. 26.)
On May 13, 2019, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant, alleging delinquent
debt  totaling  $14,859.  When  he  responded  to  the  SOR  allegations,  Applicant  did  not
dispute any of the delinquencies, but he indicated that he had brought his truck loan (SOR
¶  1.a)  current.  He  expressed  an  intention  to  pay  the  $105  cable  bill  (SOR  ¶  1.f)  first,
because it is the lowest, followed by the debts in SOR ¶ 1.g ($829), SOR ¶ 1.h ($231), and
SOR ¶ 1.i ($216) in that order. (Answer.)
At his September 2019 hearing, Applicant testified that he has been current on his
truck loan for the past five months; that in late July 2019, he entered into a debt repayment
plan for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.e under which he contracted to pay $265 a month for
two years to a debt servicer; and that he has made two payments, those due in August
2019 and September 2019. (Answer.) Because of their smaller balances, the debt servicer
did not want to deal with them. Applicant was to take care of the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f-1.j on
his own. He had not contacted the creditors as of September 2019. (Tr. 23-27, 31-33, 35.)
When  asked  to  explain  his  delay  in  addressing  the  smaller  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.f-1.j,
Applicant responded:
I just hadn’t had the time, I guess. It just went over my head. I’ve just, in my
head, I’ve been thinking, like [the debt servicer is] going to take care of it, but
then  I  forget  that,  they’re  not  handling  the  small  bills.  So  that’s  my
responsibility,  on  my,  on  my  sole  self,  to  —  you’re  right  —  call,  to  get  in
contact with all these debt collectors and just clear all the little ones out of the
way. (Tr. 36.)
Applicant’s girlfriend just recently increased her work hours to 30 per week, which
nets her $550 to $560 every two weeks. (Tr. 34, 49.)  Applicant has $5,500 in his savings
account  for  emergencies  or  unexpected  repairs.  (Tr.  37.)  He  maintains  a  balance  of
approximately $200 in his checking account to ensure that he has enough to cover those
bills that are being paid through automatic deduction. (Tr. 38.) Applicant’s take-home pay
was $600 a month or about $49,000 a year until August 2019, when he began working an
extra 12 hours per week in overtime. (Tr. 59-60.) With overtime, he takes home $3,400 a
month. (Tr. 46.) Applicant estimated that, after paying recurrent bills like his rent and truck
loan, he has about $600 to $650 each month for other expenses, including gasoline for his
“gas-guzzler” truck and the $265 to the debt servicer. (Tr. 55-56.) He and his girlfriend do
not currently have daycare expenses because his mother cares for their children when they
are  working.  (Tr.  50-51.)  Applicant  received  some  budget  counseling  from  the  debt
services firm reportedly handling his debt repayment plan. (Tr. 54.) Apart from a $650 truck
repair bill for his truck in spring 2019, Applicant has not incurred any sizeable unexpected
expenses in the past year. (Tr. 60.) He testified that he had the funds to address the debts
in SOR ¶¶ 1.f ($105), 1.h ($231), and 1.i ($216). (Tr. 62.)
In October 2019, Applicant and his spouse renewed their lease for another year on
the townhouse they rent. (AE A.) He had to pay $3,800 because his landlord wanted the
first and last months’ rent. Because of that expense and the illness of a family member, he
had not paid any of the smaller debts excluded from the debt repayment plan. (AE B.) I
extended the deadline for documentation to October 25, 2019, but no documents were
received that could corroborate his compliance with his debt repayment plan or any efforts
to repay the debts excluded from the plan. Applicant does not know whether any of his
creditors  objected  to  inclusion  in  the  debt  repayment  plan.  Instead  of  a  portion  of  his
payments being split among his creditors, his creditors will be paid off one by one, starting
with his largest debt (SOR ¶ 1.b). (Tr. 57.)
Applicant’s tax refund for tax year 2018 was taken by the Internal Revenue Service
to reduce his outstanding tax delinquency for tax year 2017 to its current $1,300. As of
September 2019, he had not considered taking some of his savings to pay off his tax debt.
(Tr. 51-52.) On October 11, 2019, he indicated that he had that day contacted the IRS,
made a down payment toward his tax delinquency, and scheduled a monthly payment. (AE
B.) He provided no details of the payment amounts, so it is unclear when that debt will be
resolved.
As  of  October  2019,  Applicant  had  taken  no  steps  to  address  his  smaller
delinquencies  that  he  knew  he  had  to  address  on  his own.  He  explained  that medical
issues for his mother left him unable to focus on what he needed to get done to mitigate
the Government’s security concerns.
