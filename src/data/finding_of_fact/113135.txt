Applicant is a 59-year-old building security officer for a defense contractor, most
recently employed since April 2018. She listed a five-month period of unemployment in
2015, and noted an inconsistent employment history from 1996 to 2001. She graduated
high school in 1979, and is currently taking classes toward an associate’s degree. She
married in 1990, and has no children. She does not currently hold a security clearance.
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  F,  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  filed  in  2000  and
discharged  in  2001;  a  Chapter  13  Bankruptcy  filed  in  2007  and  discharged  in  2014;  a
Chapter  13  bankruptcy  filed  in  2016,  converted  to  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy,  and
discharged  in  August  2016;  and  a  vehicle  loan  collection  account  totaling  $22,000.  In
addition, the SOR alleges under Guideline E, that Applicant falsified her 2018 SCA by
failing to disclose the collection account listed in the SOR. Applicant admitted all of the
bankruptcy allegations, and denied the auto loan collection and falsification allegations.
Applicant  and  her  spouse  have  inconsistent  work  histories,  partially  due  to  her
spouse’s  disabilities,  and  Applicant  expended  time  and  money  to  assist  her  elderly
mother. Applicant’s spouse was injured while serving on active duty and in a civilian job,
and  receives  disability  benefits  from  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  and  Social
Security. He testified that he worked 27 jobs in 25 years because of a back injury and
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). They jointly filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy petitions
in 1997 and 1998. Both were dismissed.
In 2000, Applicant’s spouse was injured on the job and unable to work. Since they
were both working in temporary jobs at the time, they were unable to generate sufficient
household income to meet their expenses. They filed a joint Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition
in 2000 that was discharged in 2001. Applicant stated that they were able to discharge
about $20,000 in consumer debt. In 2001 they started a business supplying gift shops.
The business closed in 2006.
In  2007,  Applicant  and  her  spouse  filed  a  joint  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  petition.
Applicant paid $4,348 to creditors under the plan, and $141,866 of unsecured claims were
discharged without payment. The bankruptcy  was discharged in 2014. The bankruptcy
filing  was  preceded  by  Applicant’s  spouse  receiving  an  $81,000  settlement  for  a
workplace  injury  in  2006.  Applicant  also  had  a  home foreclosed  in  2006  because  they
were unable to refinance. The mortgage deficiency balance was forgiven after the 2007
bankruptcy was filed.
Two  years  after  the  last  bankruptcy  discharge,  Applicant  and  her  spouse  again
filed a joint Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in March 2016. They converted the petition to
a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  May  2016.  Applicant  abandoned  $80,410  in  assets  and
discharged $241,832 in debts. The bankruptcy was discharged in August 2016. Applicant
claims the majority of debts were joint accounts initiated by her spouse, who purchased
three vehicles for a ride-share business, but the business quickly failed. He also had about
$100,000 in student loans that were forgiven due to his disability.
Applicant took out an auto loan that became delinquent in 2016 for $38,183, and
placed  in  collection.  She  stated  that  she  began  paying  the  agreed  $530  per  month  in
October  2016,  but  fell  behind  by  making  partial,  irregular  payments  beginning  in  April
2017.  In  May  2019,  she  made  a  $7,221  payment  to  bring  the  account  current,  and
resumed the $530 monthly payments from June to September 2019. She stated that she
was laid off from work when she was unable to make all required payments, however, the
partial, irregular payments lasted from July 2017 until May 2019. As of September 2019,
Applicant owed a balance of $19,091 on the account. Of note, Applicant reported that she
worked two full-time jobs at that time; from September 2015 to January 2018 as a cashier
for a government contractor, and a second job from September 2015 to September 2016
as a receiving clerk for a retail store.
Applicant provided a basic budget purporting to show that she and her spouse live
within their means using her spouse’s disability income alone. Applicant testified that she
currently earns about $48,000 per year, and her spouse receives about $50,000 per year
in disability income. Applicant has about $1,000 in savings, and is paying on a $28,000
student loan. She also has joint certificates of deposit valued at about $28,346.
In  July  2019,  Applicant  and  her  spouse  took  a  vacation  and  entered  into  a
timeshare  agreement.  Despite  a  plan  to  vacation  in  Hawaii  and  Israel,  they  later
discovered  that  the  timeshare  agreement  had  a  negative  effect  on  their  credit  and
unexpected  charges  were  placed  on  their  credit  card.  They  drafted  a  letter  to  the
timeshare company asking to be relieved of the obligation because they may not be able
to purchase a home with poor credit scores. The letter is an undated and unsigned copy,
so I do not know when or if it was delivered and the current status of account. I note the
timeshare does not appear as a line item on Applicant’s budget. Applicant utilized court-
mandated credit counseling before each bankruptcy filing.
When  Applicant  completed  her  SCA  in  June  2018,  she  was  making  partial
payments  on  the  auto  loan  collection  account,  however,  she  did  not  disclose  the
delinquency or collection account as required. Applicant explained that since she was in
a  repayment  plan  with  the  collection  agent,  and  making  payments,  albeit  partial  and
irregular, that she did not consider the account to be delinquent. She stated that she did
not intentionally fail to list the debt, but misunderstood the status of the debt when she
completed the SCA. Applicant disclosed her 2016 Chapter 7 bankruptcy in her SCA.
Law and Policies
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484  U.S.  518, 528  (1988). As  Commander in  Chief,  the President  has  the  authority  to
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is  clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An
administrative  judge  must  consider  a  person’s  stability,  trustworthiness,  reliability,
discretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG ¶ 1(b).
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the
possible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant
has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the  President  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  have
established for issuing a clearance.
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the
personal or professional history  of  the applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant from
being  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information.  The  Government  has  the  burden  of
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. “Substantial
evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. Washington
Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a
nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the  criteria  listed
therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3
(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015).
Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG ¶ 1(d).
