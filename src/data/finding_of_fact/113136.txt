Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  (Company  C)  since  2018.  He honorably  served  on  active  duty  in
the U.S. military from 1999 to 2003 and in the reserve from 2003 to 2006. He seeks to
retain  a  security  clearance,  which  he  has  held  for  an  extended  period.  He  has  a
bachelor’s  degree  and  additional  credits  but  no  post-graduate  degree.  He  is  single
without children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 23-24, 28-31, 93-101; Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 1, 2; AE A, C, D)
Applicant  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  (Company  A)  at  different  locations
from  2013  until  he  was  terminated  in  late  October  2017.  In  August  2017,  he  was
working overseas as a systems engineer on a U.S. defense project on an allied nation’s
military  base.  He  was  supposed  to  teach  the  foreign  personnel  how  to  use  and
troubleshoot  the  system.  He  stated  that the foreign  personnel were  lax  about  security,
and he became desensitized to it. In an attempt to fix the system, he violated security
rules  by  logging  into  the  system  using  the  credentials  of  a  member  of  the  foreign
country’s military. (Tr. at 31-64, 73, 86-87, 111-132, 153; Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 1, 2; AE A, J, K)
Applicant was questioned about the incident by members of the foreign country’s
military.  He  lied  to  them  and  denied  that  he  used  the  foreign  military  member’s
credentials to log into the system. Applicant also lied orally and in writing to supervisory
personnel from his employer. He later told the truth to an investigator from his employer.
(Tr. at 64-85, 133-145; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE K)
Applicant admitted that he was initially untruthful to the foreign military and to his
supervisors. He stated that he panicked when questioned by the military. He was alone
in a room with four foreign military members, and he feared for his safety and freedom.
He stated that he did not tell his supervisors the truth because he did not trust them. He
stated that once he was questioned by the investigator he was completely forthcoming.
(Tr. at 64-85, 133-145, 158; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE K)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
September  2017,  while  he  was  still  employed  by  Company  A.  Under  the  employment
section,  he  wrote  that  he  was  “warned,  reprimanded,  suspended,  or  disciplined”  by
Company  A  in  September  2017,  with  the  following  description:  “Logged  in  as  another
user to finish a task that I was assigned. An investigation was conducted with the results
being that no information was taken and no malicious intent was done.”  (Tr. at 85; AE
G)
Because  of  his  actions  in  the  foreign  country,  Applicant  was  terminated  by
Company  A  in  late  October  2017.  He  was  hired  by  another  defense  contractor
(Company  B)  in  about  November  2017.  There  was  some  difficulty  in  transferring  his
clearance from Company A to Company B, and he was asked to complete another SF
86, which he submitted in December 2017. He was able to use the September 2017 SF
86 as a template and add anything that had to be updated. (Tr. at 73, 85-88, 145-147;
GE 1; AE A, B)
Applicant  reported  his  employment  with  Company  A  ended  in  November  2017.
He repeated the same information from the previous questionnaire that he was “warned,
reprimanded,  suspended, or disciplined” by  Company  A  in September 2017.  He  wrote
the  reason  for  leaving  the  job  as  “My  position  was  downsized.”  (GE  1)  He  answered
“No” to the following question:
For  this  employment  have  any  of  the  following  happened  to  you  in  the
last seven (7) years?
  Fired
  Quit after being told you would be fired
  Left  by  mutual  agreement  following  charges  or  allegations  of
misconduct
  Left  by  mutual  agreement
following  notice  of  unsatisfactory
performance
Applicant was notified by Company B’s facility security officer (FSO) on February
22,  2018,  that  his  investigation  was  completed,  and  that  based  on  an  investigation
dated May 2, 2013, he was “granted Secret eligibility” on January 24, 2018. (AE H)
Applicant requested a copy of his DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF)
adjudicative records on April 30, 2018. The DOD CAF replied on May 16, 2018, with a
copy of the September 2017 SF 86. (AE G)
Applicant was interviewed for his background investigation in July 2018. A signed
statement  was  not  obtained,  but  the  interview  was  summarized  in  a  report  of
investigation (ROI). He voluntarily informed the investigator that he was terminated from
Company  A  in  October  2017.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  did  not  know  why  his
questionnaire reported his position was downsized, as he completed the questionnaire
in September 2017 while he was working for Company A. (Tr. at 90-91; GE 2; AE I)
Applicant  was  provided  a  copy  of  the  ROI  in  DOHA  interrogatories  and  asked
about its accuracy. He wrote the following in a response, dated May 2, 2019: “I listed my
position as downsized because my manager, [redacted], told me they were doing away
with the position before I was terminated.” (GE 2)
Applicant’s  response  to  the  SOR  was  prepared  by  his attorney,  but  adopted  by
Applicant  as  the  truth  and  notarized  on  June  21,  2019  (48  days  after  his  response  to
DOHA interrogatories). The response stated:
Regarding  the  CAF’s  allegation  that  [Applicant]  submitted  this  SF  86  in
December, and that he reported that he had been “downsized,” he has not
been provided with any evidence that that is the case. He has no memory
of that, has no reason to have lied when he had already been forthcoming
about the same incident and later was forthcoming in an interview.
Applicant  denied  intentionally  providing  false  information  on  the  SF  about  his
termination from Employer A. He stated that he submitted the September 2017 SF 86,
but he did not remember submitting a second SF 86. He stated that he had no reason to
lie  because  he  reported  the  underlying  conduct  to  the  DOD.  He  asserted,  without
corroborating documentation, that Company B was aware that he had been terminated
from  Company  A  because  he  put  it  on  his  job  application.  He  stated  that  he  did  not
remember writing on the SF 86 that his position with Company A was “downsized,” but if
he  did  write  it,  it  was  because  when  he  left  the  foreign  country  he  was  told  by  his
supervisor that his position was being downsized and would be backfilled by a foreign
national. (Tr. at 85-89, 108-111, 149-156; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant  volunteers  in  his  community.  He  submitted  documents  and  letters
attesting to his excellent job performance in the military and as a civilian. He is praised
for  his  moral  character,  honesty,  patriotism,  professionalism,
trustworthiness,
responsibility,  work  ethic,  reliability,  judgment,  integrity,  and  willingness  and  ability  to
protect classified information. He is recommended for a security clearance. (AE B-F)
