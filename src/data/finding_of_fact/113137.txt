Unless  otherwise  indicated  by  citation  to  another  part  of  the  record,  I  have
extracted  these  findings  of  fact  from  Applicant’s  SOR  Answer  (Item  2),  and  her  SCA
(Item  3).  Applicant,  age  40,  is  married  with  three  minor  children.  She  has  been
employed as an engineer by the same defense contractor since earning her bachelor’s
degree in 2001. She has held a DOD security clearance since 2002.
The SOR alleged 12 delinquent accounts that were either charged off or placed
for  collection  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  –  1.l).  The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.l  is  a  duplicate  of  that
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e. The remaining 11 debts totaled $39,646.  Applicant admitted  the
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.e, and 1.g – 1.k. Although she denied the debts alleged
in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  1.d,  and  1.f  on  the  basis  that  the  underlying  accounts  were
fraudulently  opened  in  her  name,  she  accepted  responsibility  for  paying  them.  (AE  I;
Item 5 at 4; Item 6 at 2)
The  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and  1.d  are  three  credit  union  accounts
totaling  $29,180.  The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.f  is  an  $833  online  retailer  charge
account.  These four accounts  were  opened in  2014.  Applicant  was  not  aware of  them
until she reviewed a credit report in about May 2017. After investigating the matter and
discovering that neither she nor her husband had opened the accounts, she deemed it
to be fraudulent activity. She contacted several attorneys, each of whom advised her to
pay or otherwise resolve the accounts with the creditors because of the high legal costs
associated  with  disputing  them  and  her  delayed  detection  of  the  suspected  fraud.
Following  advice  of  counsel,  Applicant  and  her  husband  accepted  responsibility  for
repaying  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  1.d,  and  1.f.  They  also  chose  not  to
formally  contest  them  by  filing  police  reports  or  disputes  with  the  credit  bureau
agencies. (Item 2 at 3; Item 3 at 32-33; Item 4 at 2; Item 5 at 5 and 8)
In  April  2018,  Applicant  and  her  husband  engaged  the  services  of  a  debt  relief
program (DRP) to assist them in resolving their delinquent debts. They anticipated that
the  working  with  the  DRP  would  afford  them  the  opportunity  to  negotiate  reasonable
settlements that they could afford without jeopardizing their finances.  In January 2019,
they  retained  a  credit  monitoring  agency  to  assist  them  with  monitoring  their  credit  for
fraudulent activity. The process for resolving debts through the DRP is: 1) Applicant and
her husband make bi-weekly deposits of $347 into their DRP savings account; 2) once
sufficient  funds  build  up  in  the  savings  account,  the  DRP  negotiates  agreements  with
creditors to settle the enrolled accounts, in an order determined by the DRP. Because it
takes time to accumulate sufficient funds for the larger debts, they take the longest time
to resolve. The estimated timeframe for resolving them is 24 to 48 months. (AE F; Item
2 at 3; Item 4 at 2 and 6)
From  April  2018  through  August  2019,  Applicant  and  her  husband  made  bi-
weekly deposits of $347 into the DRP savings account, totaling approximately $12,716.
The  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  –  1.f  were  enrolled  in  the  DRP,  none  of  which  had
been paid as of August 2019. However, the DRP negotiated settlement agreements in
August 2019 for the  debts  alleged  in  SOR ¶¶  1.c and  1.e  to  be paid from  DRP funds,
the balance of which was not specified in the record. (AE F; FORM Response 1).
In 2017, Applicant made monthly payments of $300 directly to the creditor of the
debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c,  reducing  the  balance  from  $6,870  to  $3,172.  She  stopped
those payments once the debt was enrolled in the DRP. Between May 2019 and August
2019, Applicant resolved, directly with the creditors, the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g –
1.k, which totaled $1,743. (Item 2 at 2; Item 6 at 2; AE C – J; FORM Response 1)
Applicant attributed her debts to fraudulent activity, an extended illness, utilizing
credit  cards  for  household  expenses  that  exceeded  her  family’s  income,  and  an
automobile  accident.  She  did  not  provide  any  specific  details  concerning  her
overspending, but averred that she did not spend money on anything extravagant. She
currently spends within her means and has not accumulated any new debts since 2017.
Her debt resolution plan includes continuing to work with the DRP,  and using a portion
of the equity from the sale of her home to resolve her remaining debts. The closing is
scheduled  for the  end  of  September  2019.  (AE  K;  Item  4  at  2-3Items  5  and  6;  FORM
Response 2)
