Applicant  is  a  54-year-old  prospective  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He
apparently  will  be  hired  as  a  linguist  if  he  obtains  a  security  clearance.  He  married  in
2003 and divorced in 2018. He has four minor children. (Items 4-6, 12, 13)
Applicant  was  born  in  Iraq  to  Iraqi  parents.  He  performed  mandatory  service  in
the Iraqi military from 1985 to 1990. He came to the United States in 2000 or 2001, and
was granted asylum. He became a U.S. citizen in 2014. (Items 4-6, 12, 13)
Applicantâ€™s children were all born in the United States. His parents are deceased.
He had seven siblings, but one sibling is deceased. One of his siblings is a U.S. citizen
and resident. Another sibling lives in the United States. Four of his siblings are citizens
and  residents  of  Iraq.  His  male  siblings  performed  mandatory  military  service,  but  it
does  not  appear  that  any  of  his  siblings  have  a  current  direct  connection  to  the  Iraqi
government. (Items 4-6, 12, 13)
Applicant worked as a linguist for defense contractors in Iraq from about 2006 to
2009.  He  indicated  that  he  was  terminated  from  the  job  after  he  had  a  fight  with  his
friend, a Pakistani linguist, over religion. His friend was also terminated. (Items 5, 6, 13)
Applicant  was  unable  to  secure  stable  employment  after  he  returned  from  Iraq.
He  also  indicated  that  his  ex-wife  overspent  and  had  costly  elective  surgery.  He  was
unable to pay all his bills, and a number of debts became delinquent. The SOR alleges
nine delinquent debts totaling about $15,000 and three unpaid judgments totaling about
$26,900.  Applicant  admitted  owing  all  the  debts  and  judgments.  The  debts  and
judgments are also  corroborated  through  credit  reports and  court  records.  (Items  3,  5-
11, 13)
Applicant stated that the $3,543 judgment was for unpaid rent. He indicated that
his state income tax refunds were garnished to pay the judgment. Court records indicate
that  garnishment  orders  were  in  effect  for  all  three  judgments,  but  the  records  are
unclear as to how much was garnished. (Items 6-11, 13)
Applicant did not submit any additional documentation about the judgments and
the delinquent debts. He  has  not  paid any  of  the  delinquent  debts,  even  though  six  of
the debts are between $104 and $300. He did not state how, when, or if he plans to pay
his debts. There is no evidence of financial counseling.
