The SOR alleges five defaulted student loans with balances totaling $116,887, as
listed  on  an  April  2019  credit  report.  The  three  student  loans  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.c
through  1.e  total  $57,022.  The  three  loans  are  serviced  by  the  same  company  and
collected  through  one  payment.  Applicant  documented  that  he  has  been  regularly
paying  the  loans  since  May  2014,  albeit  possibly  not  at  the  rate  required  by  his  loan
agreements.  When  adjusted  for  reversals,  he  made  four  $275  payments,  three  $250
payments,  and  one  $125  payment  in  2014  ($1,975  total  in  2014);  ten  $250  payments
and  one  $500  payment  in  2015  ($3,000  total  in  2015);  ten  $250  payments  in  2016
($2,500  total  in  2016);  eleven  $250  payments  in  2017  ($2,750  total  in  2017);  twelve
$250 payments in 2018 ($3,000 total in 2018); and as of April 2019, four $250 payments
in  2019  ($1,000  total  as  of  April  2019).  The  total  of  his  payments  from  2014  through
April 2019 total $14,225, and as of May 2019, the balance was reduced to $56,773. He
documented  additional  $250  payments,  making  the  total  amount  paid  more  than
$15,000 and reducing the balance to $55,523 as of October 2019. (Tr. at 18; GE 2, 4;

SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($34,637) and 1.b ($25,228) allege defaulted student loans  totaling
$59,865 to the Department of Education. Applicant’s wages were garnished about $361
every  two  weeks  starting  in  June  2017.  $4,700  was  garnished  in  2017.  An  additional
$1,467  was  garnished  through  February  2018.  The  amount  of  additional  payments  is
unclear,  but  the  Department  of  Education  reported  that  he  paid  $1,842  in  interest  in
2018. (Tr. at 20-23; GE 1-4, 6; AE C, D)
The  garnishment  stopped  in  February  or  March  2018,  and  the  loans  were
transferred to a collection company. Applicant had some difficulty coordinating with the
collection  company  and  only  made  sporadic  payments.  He  paid  $250  in  September
2018 and $200 in December 2018. An October 2019 credit reports lists both payments
(September 2018 payment reported as $144 payment to one loan and $105 payment to
second loan, and December 2018 payment reported as $115 payment to one loan and
$84  payment  to  second  loan).  He  credibly  stated  that  he  intends  to  pay  his  student
loans. (Tr. at 19-24, 32-35, 40; GE 2-6; AE D, F, G)
