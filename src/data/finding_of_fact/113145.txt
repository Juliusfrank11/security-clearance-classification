Applicant admitted failing to timely file his 2011-2018 state and Federal income tax
returns, and accumulating over $4,000 delinquent debt (SOR 1.a-1.I). Record evidence
shows  that  SOR  1.a  and  1.e  are  the  same  debt.  He  is  a  52-year-old  principal  service
technician  employed  by  a  U.S.  defense  contractor  since  May  2018.  He  has  been
continuously employed in similar (non defense) positions since at least November 2004.
He served honorably in the U.S. military from February 1987 to December 1997. He has
twice  married  and  divorced,  and  has  two  adult  sons  with  his  first  wife,  and  a    minor
daughter with his second wife. He held a clearance when he was in the military, but has
never held an industrial clearance.
Applicant  disclosed  failing  to  file  his  2011-2018  state  and  Federal  income  tax
returns, and SOR debts 1.c., 1.d, and 1.g, on his June 2018 clearance application (Item
2) He attributed them to his July 2011 divorce, and stated his intent to hire professional
help to resolve his financial issues Applicant discussed his failures to file, and all the SOR
debts  except  SOR  1.c,  during  his  November  2018  interview  with  a  Government
investigator (Item 3), based on his July 2018 credit report (Item 4). He attributed his failure
to timely file his state and Federal income tax returns for the years at issue to his 2011
divorce, the death of both parents, his being overwhelmed at work, and his child support
issues. He had taken no action to resolve his tax issues or debts, but still intended to get
professional  help.  His  March  2019  credit  (Item  5)  report  shows  SOR  debts  1.a-1.f  still
unresolved; SOR debt 1.g did not appear on Item 5 because it was reported by a different
credit agency.
Applicant has no idea how much he owes in delinquent taxes, fees, and penalties.
No one knows about his financial issues except his children, but they are not aware of the
extent of the problem.
Applicant=s Answer (Item 1) admitted the SOR allegations, but did not otherwise
illuminate his financial situation. Applicant documented no credit or financial counseling,
and did not submit a budget. He provided no work or character references, or evidence
of community involvement.
