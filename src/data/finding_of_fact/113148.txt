Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant did not file as required
his federal income tax returns for the 2011 – 2014 and 2016 tax years (SOR 1.a); that he
did not file his state income tax returns for the same years (SOR 1.b); that he owes unpaid
federal taxes totaling $68,702, a debt that is being enforced by a tax lien filed against him
in  2017  (SOR  1.c);  and  that  he  owes  $2,174  for  a  delinquent  or  past-due  credit  card
account (SOR 1.d). Applicant admitted without explanation all four allegations. (FORM,
Item 1)
In response to the FORM, Applicant successfully refuted the allegation at SOR 1.d.
On October 27, 2015, the creditor resolved that debt in Applicant’s favor as a fraudulent
use  of  his  personal  information.  Applicant  initially  made  that  claim  when  he  was
interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  December  2018.  In  addition  to  the  facts
established by Applicant’s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. (Response
to FORM; FORM, Items 3 and 7)
Applicant  is  a  60-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  for  whom  he  has
worked since October 1991. Applicant and his wife have been married since April 2008,
and he has lived in the same home since August 1998. (FORM, Item 2)
In Section 26 (Financial Record) of his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that he did not
file his federal income tax returns on time for the tax years 2011 – 2014. He further stated
that he filed those returns in 2016. In his e-QIP responses, Applicant also estimated that
he owed about $20,000 in unpaid federal income taxes for those years, and that he was
“working with Tax Relief Agency and the IRS to pay off Federal tax debt.” (FORM, Item
2)
In response to interrogatories sent to Applicant by Department Counsel, Applicant
provided information showing that in December 2017, the IRS filed a substitute return for
Applicant for the 2011 tax year; and that in January 2017, a substitute return was filed for
his 2012 income taxes. In response to the FORM, Applicant provided information showing
that he also did not file or pay his 2007 federal income taxes, with the IRS having filed a
substitute return in October 2009. As of October 30, 2019, Applicant still owed the IRS
$8,360  for  the  2007  tax  year.  Applicant  filed  his  federal  returns  for  2013  –  2015  in
December 2016. He filed his 2016 and 2017 returns in October 2018, and his 2018 return
in June 2019. Applicant’s state income tax returns were filed at or near the same time as
his federal returns. He could not file his state returns until his federal returns were filed
because the federal information (e.g., adjusted gross income, tax deductions and credits,
etc.)  were  required  as  input  to  his  state  returns.  As  to  all  of  his  income  tax  returns,
Applicant did not claim, and the record does not show, that he requested extensions for
the  filing  deadline  in  any  of  the  tax  years  at  issue  here.  (Response  to  FORM;  FORM,
Items 2 and 3)
Applicant explained his failure to file his income tax returns as  resulting from an
inability to pay the additional taxes that were required when his returns were calculated.
With each passing year, he avoided filing his returns because he knew he still could not
pay,  especially  as  the  past-due  amounts  were  adding  up.  Applicant  has  estimated  he
owes  as  much  as  $90,000  in  unpaid  federal  taxes,  penalties  and  interest.  The  record
does not show that Applicant owes any unpaid state taxes. On June 30, 2017 the IRS
obtained a federal tax lien against Applicant to enforce a $68,702 tax debt.  As of June
2019, Applicant was working with a tax consulting agency to address his past-due filings
and his tax debts. On June 17, 2019, Applicant requested from the IRS transcripts of his
federal income tax accounts for the 2011 – 2018 tax years. The same day, he proposed
a  tax  repayment  agreement  with  the  IRS  whereby  he  would  pay  $990  monthly  for  28
months to satisfy a $49,938.53 tax debt for the 2007 – 2014 tax years. In July and August
2019, Applicant made the first two of those payments. He did not submit any information
that addresses repayment of unpaid taxes for 2015 – 2018 or of the $18,764 difference
between his repayment plan and the federal tax lien against him. Additionally, the June
2019 repayment agreement would repay only $27,720 of the $49,938 owed for 2007 –
2014. (FORM, Items 3 and 6)
According to the IRS transcript produced with Applicant’s response to the FORM,
he  earned  $88,534  in  2007.  The  other  IRS  transcripts  provided  in  response  to
interrogatories  show  his  average  income  between  2011  and  2018  was  $115,828.
Applicant  did  not  present  any  additional  information  about  his  monthly  finances,  his
management  of  his  personal  finances,  or  any  financial  counseling  aside  from  the  tax
consulting services he obtained. (FORM, Item 3)
