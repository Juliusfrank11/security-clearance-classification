I  have  incorporated  Applicant’s  admissions  to  the  allegations  set  for  in  SOR  ¶¶
1.a-1.e in my findings of fact. Applicant’s personal information is extracted from GE 4, his
SCA, unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  the  Government’s  FORM  and  the  documentary
evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 35 years old and was married in 2012. He earned some college credits,
but transferred to a technical institute where he completed his studies in automotive and
diesel technology in 2010. He has worked in a number of positions since 2010, including
two  years  (2012-2014)  with  a  major  defense  contractor.  Since  October  2016,  he  has
worked as a computer analyst for a government contractor, which is sponsoring him for
a clearance.
In 2002, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps and served honorably for five
years until his discharge in 2007 with the rank of corporal (E-4). He was granted eligibility
for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) in 2003. He was again granted
SCI eligibility in 2012 when he began working at the major defense contractor. He was
unemployed for about ten months after he was terminated for cause by that contractor for
his misuse of a work computer system. The record is unclear whether he retained his top
secret and SCI eligibility prior to submitting the SCA.
Applicant provided virtually no information regarding his financial problems except
that his wife has a serious illness and has accumulated uninsured medical bills in excess
of  $36,000.  This  information  was  just  briefly  mentioned  in  his  September  2018
background  interview  and  then  with  no  details  about  any  connection  with  his
indebtedness, as alleged in the SOR and admitted in his response. As of the date of his
background interview in September 2018 and presumably earlier while employed by his
sponsor, Applicant had medical insurance that covered his wife’s ongoing medical bills.
This coverage  presumably  continues  with  Applicant’s employment  with  his sponsor. In
his  background  interview,  he  identified  to  the  investigator  six  delinquent  debts,  five  of
which are now the subjects of the SOR allegations. He advised that he intended to pay
these debts through a Chapter 13 bankruptcy that he was preparing with his lawyer to
file. The bankruptcy petition was actually filed about 11 months later. He advised that his
annual  salary  is  $66,000.  He  made  no  mention  of  his  wife’s  employment  status.  The
Chapter 13 petition reflects that his wife has not worked since sometime in 2017, when
she earned about $23,000 in that year. The record does not reflect the reason for her loss
of income since 2017. (GE 7 at 3; AE A at 8-9.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c – Two credit-card accounts with a credit union charged
off  in  the  amounts  of  $17,170  and  $5,022,  respectively  –  The  credit  reports  in  the
record reflect that these accounts were opened in 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and 2017 (SOR ¶
1.c). Applicant defaulted on both in or about June 2018, and the credit union charged off
both  accounts.  Applicant  commented  in  his September 2018  background  investigation
that  his  bankruptcy  attorney  advised  him  not  to  pay  anything  on  these  two  delinquent
accounts or on any of the three other debts alleged in the SOR until ordered to do so by
the bankruptcy judge. These two debts and perhaps others debts owed to this creditor
are included in Applicant’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. (GE 5 at 3; GE 6 at 2; GE 7 at
3; AE A at 9 of 19.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e – Two credit-card accounts with a bank charged off in the
amounts of $1,861 and $604, respectively – The credit reports in the record reflect that
these  accounts  were  opened  in  2014  (SOR  ¶  1.d)  and  2004  (SOR  ¶  1.e).  Applicant
defaulted on both in or about July 2018, and the bank charged off both accounts. These
debts appear to be included in his Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. The record evidence
suggests that the two accounts were combined, and a civil court entered a judgment in
the  total debt  owed  to  this  creditor.  It  is unclear  however,  if  this  assumption  is  correct
because the last four digits of the listed account do not match the last four digits of either
credit card. Applicant has offered no clarification about the status of these debts under
his bankruptcy petition. (GE 5 at 2, 3; GE 6 at 2; AE A at 5 of 19.)
SOR ¶ 1.b – Healthcare credit account with a bank charged off in collection
in the amount of $5,185 – The credit reports in the record reflect that this healthcare
credit account was opened in 2013. This may have been opened in connection with the
treatment of Applicant’s wife. Applicant defaulted on the account in or about July 2018,
and the bank placed the account with a collection agency.  This debt is included in his
bankruptcy petition. (GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 2; AE A at 11 of 19.)
The record evidence contains virtually no information explaining why he defaulted
on these five debts. Perhaps his wife’s illness forced her to leave her job, and the couple
lost her income. There is no evidence in the record, however, to support such speculation
is a fact. The record reflects that the couple bought a house in February 2017 and opened
a mortgage loan account at that time in the amount of $213,000 with a monthly payment
of $1,121. In his bankruptcy petition, he valued his house to be worth $250,000. They
also own a former residence in a different state worth about $140,000. This home has
been abandoned due to its poor condition. The record also reflects that Applicant opened
an auto loan in August 2018 in the amount of about $22,000 with a monthly payment of
$506.  This  vehicle  apparently  replaced  a  vehicle  damaged  by  hail.  In  addition,  his
bankruptcy petition lists a number of other debts as joint debts of Applicant and his wife
that do not appear in either of Applicant’s credit reports in the record or the SOR.  The
total  of  all  of  the  unsecured  debts  owed  by  Applicant  and  his  wife,  as  listed  in  his
bankruptcy petition, is about $112,000. (GE 5 at 6; GE 6 at 2 GE 7 at 3; AE A at 11, 27,
19 of 19.)
Aside from  his Chapter 13  petition,  Applicant  offered no  evidence  regarding  his
debts  or  his  character.  Since  his  petition  was  filed  so  recently,  he  has  no  additional
bankruptcy records or other evidence regarding his repayment plan for his debts or any
track record of having made payments to his creditors. His petition states that he received
credit  counseling from  an approved  credit  counselling  agency  within  six  months  of  the
filing of the petition. (AE A at 5.)
