I have incorporated Applicant’s admissions in her response to the allegations set
forth  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.g  in  my  findings  of  fact  and  have  noted  her  denials.  Applicant’s
personal information is extracted from GE 4, her SCA, unless otherwise indicated by a
parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,
the  Government’s  FORM,  and  the  documentary  evidence  in  the  record,  I  make  the
following findings of fact:
Applicant, 60, has married twice and divorced once. She has been separated from
her current husband for a number of years and has had no recent contact with him. She
has  three  adult  children  from  her  first  marriage.  In  1977,  she  earned  a  high  school
diploma. Since 2006, she has worked as an inspector for a DOD contractor. She has also
worked part time since 2009 as a child-care provider. Applicant was granted a security
clearance in 2007 in connection with her employment with the defense contractor. With
the submission of her June 2016 SCA, she seeks to renew her clearance eligibility. (GE
6 at 5-6.)
In her SCA, she disclosed that she had failed to file her 2014 and 2015 federal and
state tax returns as required because she did not have the funds to pay her taxes. She
also  wrote  that  she  planned  “to  resolve  this  shortly.”  In  her  May  2018  background
interview, she discussed her failure to file and pay only as to  tax years (TY) 2014 and
2015. She estimated that she owed $2,000 for each of the two years. She said that she
intended  to  file  and  pay  her  taxes  in  2018.  Her  response  to  DOHA’s  interrogatories
revealed for the first time that she also had failed to file her federal TY 2017 return on
time and  had failed to  pay  her federal taxes  each  year from TY  2016 through  2018  in
addition to TY 2014 and 2015. She  disclosed that she owes approximately $17,000 in
back taxes. (GE 6 at 8, 12.)
With her interrogatory responses, Applicant also provided IRS account transcripts
for TY 2014 through 2018. The transcripts reflect she filed her TY 2014 return on June
17, 2019; her TY 2015 return on June 10, 2019; and her TY 2017 return on April 15, 2019.
The TY 2016 transcripts evidenced that Applicant’s 2016 return was filed on August 7,
2017  and  that  she  had  filed  an  extension,  giving  her  until  October  15,  2017  to  file.
Accordingly, this return was filed in a timely manner. The TY 2018 transcript shows that
her return was filed on June 3, 2019, without an extension. On August 30, 2017, the IRS
agreed  to  an  installment  payment  plan  of  $100  per  month  for  TY  2016.  The  2016  tax
transcript  shows  that  she  made  monthly  payments  of  $100  for  19  months  starting  in
October  2017  and  ending  in  April  2019,  leaving  a  balance  due  for  TY  2016  of  about
$2,000. (GE 6 at 18-19, 20-33.)
The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file her federal and state tax returns as
required  for  a  four-year  period,  TY  2014  through  2017,  and  that  she  owed  delinquent
taxes  for  the  five-year  period  TY  2014  through  2018  in  the  approximate  amount  of
$18,000.  Applicant  admitted  these  allegations,  except  she  denied  that  her  TY  2016
federal and state tax returns were not filed. She also explained that she had entered into
an  installment  agreement  to  pay  her  delinquent  federal  taxes  for  TY  2016,  but  that
agreement was suspended in mid-2019 due to the filing of her TY 2014, 2015, 2017, and
2018 federal returns earlier in 2019.
This evidence,  along  with  Applicant  admissions  in  her  SOR  response, establish
the facts alleged in the SOR, except for the allegation of late filing for TY 2016. According
to the transcripts, she now owes approximately $21,000 in delinquent federal taxes. In a
letter  dated  July  8,  2019,  the  IRS  accepted  Applicant’s  newly  proposed  installment-
payment  plan  to  pay  $288  per  month  towards  her  back  taxes.  In  her  July  23,  2019
response to the FORM, she provided no evidence of any payments under this agreement.
(GE 3 at 3; GE 6 at 20-33.)
With respect to her state tax returns, Applicant wrote in her interrogatory response
that she filed these returns on March 22, 2019 (TY 2014 and 2015); June 29, 2017 (TY
2016); March 22, 2019 (TY 2017); and April 12, 2019 (TY 2018). Assuming that she filed
for an extension to file her 2016 return after April 15, 2017, as she did with the IRS, her
TY  2016  and  2018  returns  were  timely  filed  and  her  TY  2014,  2015,  and  2017  state
returns were not filed as required. She claims that she owes less than $100 in delinquent
state taxes. In response to DOHA’s interrogatory request for state tax account transcripts
for the years in question, she wrote that her state tax authority does not provide annual
account transcripts or the equivalent. She did provide a letter from the state tax authority
with respect to tax year 2016, which shows that she owed a nominal amount for that year.
(GE 5 at 9.)
In  her  SCA,  background  interview,  and  again  in  her  SOR  response,  Applicant
explained that she fell behind on her tax filings and payments because she was unable
to pay her taxes when they were due. She claims this was due to illness and two knee
surgeries, one in 2014 and a second in 2015. She asserts, without supporting evidence,
that she lost income because of these and other serious medical problems. That may be
true, but her tax transcripts reflect that any loss of income was more than offset by other
factors.  Using  her  2014  income  as  a  baseline,  her  adjusted  gross  income  increased
almost $15,000 in 2015; $1,000 in 2016; $9,000 in 2017; and almost $6,000 in 2018. In
each year, her taxes were not fully paid due to insufficient withholding or a failure to pay
quarterly  estimated  taxes  as  a  1099  self-employed,  independent  contractor  working  in
her part-time, child-care position. (GE 6 at 20-33.)
The record reflects that Applicant received financial counseling with respect to her
consumer and medical debts. With the assistance of a debt-consolidation firm, she paid
off her credit cards and other debts and was basically debt free by the end of 2017. The
record contains no evidence that she received any financial counseling from a legitimate
and  credible  tax  advisor,  nor  is  there  any  evidence,  except  her  history  of  medical
problems, as to why she did not attempt to address her unfiled tax returns and tax debts
until 2019, with the single exception of her TY 2016 returns and delinquent taxes for that
year. (GE 6 at 8-10.)
