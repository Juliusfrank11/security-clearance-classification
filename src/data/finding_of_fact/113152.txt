The SOR alleged that Applicant owes $24,129 for a home equity line of credit (SOR
1.a).  In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  the  allegation.  He  also  provided  a
statement to explain how the debt came about, and he provided a copy of an agreement
with the collection agency that now owns the account. (FORM, Items 1 and 3). In addition
to the facts established by Applicant’s admissions, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  70-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  for  whom  he  has
worked  since  October  1997.  He  stated  in  his  e-QIP  that  he  first  received  a  security
clearance in June 1996. Applicant also served in the U.S. Army between 1970 and 1973.
He and his wife have been married since August 1988, when they bought a house used
as their marital residence until May 2007. At that time, Applicant bought a second house
in which he and his wife still reside. Applicant still owns his previous residence, which he
has been using as a rental property since moving in 2007. (FORM, Items 4 and 5)
The debt alleged at SOR 1.a represents the balance due from a home equity line
of credit (HELOC) Applicant obtained in  2006 for his rental property. At some point he
stopped paying that account, and it was charged off by the lender as a business loss in
2015. The required monthly payment had been $143. Applicant claimed that he was not
able to meet his HELOC obligations because of a loss of income that coincided with the
need for extensive repairs on his rental property. Applicant also claimed that he was beset
by renters who did not honor their leases and who damaged his property.
In July 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator about the
SOR  1.a  debt  and  other  financial  problems  he  had  experienced  beginning  in  2000.
Applicant stated at that time his intention to finish remodeling his rental property to market
it to renters and cover the mortgages on that property. In response to the SOR a year
later, Applicant stated that he had spent $25,000 since 2017 to restore his rental property,
which was empty and not earning revenue during that time. As of July 2019, Applicant
claimed that he now has renters and is using a management company to “stay on top of
things.” Available information shows that Applicant actually owes $39,976 for this debt,
which is now in collection with another creditor. (FORM, Items 3, 5, and 7)
Additionally, Applicant provided with his Answer information showing that on July
26, 2019, he executed an agreement with the collection agency now holding the SOR 1.a
debt. That agreement provided that Applicant would make a $1,740.92 down payment
and 11 monthly payments of $367.92. If Applicant makes all of the payments required
therein by July 2020, his credit report will be updated to show he is current on the HELOC,
and the original terms of the HELOC will be restored and his monthly payments lowered
to near their previous amount. In short, Applicant has entered into a loan rehabilitation
agreement  with  the  collection  agency.  Applicant  made  the  required  down  payment  on
July  16,  2019.  He  did not  provide  any  information  that  shows  he  took  other actions  to
resolve his debt between 2015 and 2019. He also has not sought or received any financial
counseling, and the record does not contain any information about his current monthly
finances. (FORM, Item 3)
