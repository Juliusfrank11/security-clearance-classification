In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  factual  allegations
pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.f.). Applicant’s
admissions  are  incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  complete  and  thorough
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the
following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a technical service engineer with his current employer since October 2012. He enlisted
in the Army National Guard, and served from February 2008 until February 2015, when
he  was  honorably  discharged.  He  is  a  2006  high  school  graduate.  He  was  granted  a
secret  clearance  in 2008.  He  was  married  in  2013, and  divorced  in  2016.  He has one
child, born in 2012.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can  be  found  in  the  following  exhibits:  Item  4  (Combined  Experian,  TransUnion,  and
Equifax Credit Report, dated May 25, 2018); Item 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated April 2,
2019);  Item  6  (Equifax  Credit  Report,  dated  July  8,  2019);  Item  3  (Enhanced  Subject
Interview, dated July 9, 2018); Item 2 (SF 86, dated May 1, 2018); and Item 1 (Applicant’s
Answer to SOR, dated June 7, 2019).
In his SF 86, Applicant listed several delinquent  accounts, and he attributed his
financial difficulties to his divorce; his ex-wife’s failure to make car payments; and child
support  payments.  (Item  2,  at  33-37)  On  July  31,  2018,  he  was  interviewed  by  an
investigator  with  the  U.S.  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  At  that  time,  he
explained that because of the divorce and a relocation  to an out-of-state location for a
new job, he became short on funds and was unable to maintain his accounts in a current
status. He contended that he had attempted to pay his creditors a little at a time and that
he  was  saving  money  to  enable  him  to  pay  off  his  debts.  In  doing  so,  he  altered  his
spending habits, and no longer uses credit cards. (Item 3, at 4) He was questioned about
his  delinquent  accounts,  and  he  acknowledged  that  two  vehicles  were  repossessed
because he was not making any payments; and that he had made no payments on two
other accounts. He also claimed that he had made a couple payments for one account,
and that he was making monthly payments on another account. (Item 3, at 3-4) However,
Applicant failed to submit any documents such as statements from the creditors agreeing
to  a  repayment  plan,  cancelled  checks,  copies  of  money  orders,  a  bank  register,  or
receipts, to indicate that any payments had been made to any creditor.
The SOR alleged six delinquent accounts totaling approximately $38,104. Those
allegations are set forth below:
SOR ¶ 1.a.: This is an automobile loan on a 2016 vehicle with an unpaid balance
of $12,930 that was charged off after the vehicle was repossessed. (Item 4, at 11; Item
5, at 2) Applicant acknowledged that he has not been making any payments. (Item 3, at
3; Item 1) The account is not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b.: This is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $12,582. (Item
4, at 12; Item 5, at 12; Item 6, at 1-2) Applicant’s July 2019 credit report notes that $13,982
was charged off. (Item 6, at 2) Applicant contended that he was making monthly payments
to the creditor, but he did not state the amount of the payments, or when those payments
commenced. However, Applicant’s July 2019 credit report notes that a $50 payment was
received in June 2019, and that the current balance of the account was $12,432. (Item 6,
at 1-2) The account is in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c.: This is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $6,475 that
was charged off. (Item 4, at 11; Item 5, at 2; Item 3, at 4) Applicant contended that he
“made  a  couple  payments”  to  the  creditor,  but  he  did  not  state  the  amount  of  the
payments, or when those payments commenced. He failed to submit any documentation,
such as cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support
his contention that he has made any payments to the creditor. In the absence of such
documentation, I conclude that the account is not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.d.:  This  is  a  joint  automobile  loan  on  a  2012  vehicle  with  an  unpaid
balance of $4,367 that was allegedly charged off after the vehicle was repossessed. (Item
4, at 12; Item 5, at 2; Item 6, at 3-4) Applicant’s July 2019 credit report notes that $6,681
was  actually  charged  off.  (Item  6,  at  4)  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  has  not  been
making any payments. (Item 3, at 3; Item 1) The account is not yet in the process of being
resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.e.: This is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $1,414 that
was charged off and sold to a debt purchaser. (Item 4, at 12; Item 5, at 2; Item 6, at 2, 5)
Applicant acknowledged that he has not been making any payments. (Item 3, at 3; Item
1) The account is not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.f.: This is credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $336 that was
charged off. (Item 4, at 11; Item 5, at 2; Item 6, at 2) Applicant acknowledged that he has
not been making any payments. (Item 3, at 4; Item 1) The account is not yet in the process
of being resolved.
It is not known what Applicant’s current financial resources may be because he did
not report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder
that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a
budget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of additional financial
information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position
financially than he had been.
