Applicant,  47,  is married, and has two  minor  children.  He  received  a  bachelor’s
degree in 2000. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1994 until 2007, and was separated
with a General Discharge. He has held a security clearance for almost 25 years, and he
currently holds a top secret clearance with sensitive compartmented information access
(TS/SCI).  He  has  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  since  he  left  the  Navy,  and  he  has
been a capture manager since January 2019. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 9-13)
In  1994,  while  on  active  duty,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving
while intoxicated (DWI). He held a TS/SCI security clearance at the time of the incident.
Applicant does not remember the amount of alcohol he consumed or his blood alcohol
content  (BAC)  level,  but  he  remembers  failing  the  field  sobriety  tests.  He  pled  no
contest to the charges and received fines. (GE 6 at 6; Tr. 12, 26-30)
In  January  2009,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DWI.  He  had  been
drinking at home with a friend and decided to run an errand. During his drive home, he
was pulled over for speeding. He was required to take field sobriety  tests and his BAC
level  was  .15  percent.  He  plead  guilty  to  the  reduced  charge  of  reckless  driving.
Applicant  was  sentenced  to  six  months  of  probation,  his  license  was  restricted  for  six
months,  he  was  ordered  to  pay  a  $500  fine  and  court  costs,  attend  an  alcohol  safety
action program (ASAP), and a ten-week alcohol-related class. In ASAP, Applicant was
not diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder. At the time of this incident he held a TS/SCI
security clearance. (GE 1 at 27; GE 2 at 47; GE 3 at 1-2; GE 5; Tr. 32-40)
At the time of the 2009 arrest, Applicant consumed two to three alcoholic drinks
twice  a  month.  After  the  arrest,  he  reported  the  incident  to  his  facility  security  officer
(FSO)  and  abstained  from  alcohol  for  two  to  three  years.  Applicant  admittedly  did  not
take  the  2009  arrest  seriously  enough  and  only  made  the  changes  that  were  required
due to the court requirements. (Tr. 40-44, 53-54)
In  August  2018,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DWI  and  refusal  of
blood  or  breath  test.  Applicant’s  wife  and  children  were  not  home  at  the  time  of  this
incident.  He  testified  that  he  was  driving  to  his  home  at  about  11:00  at  night  after
running  an  errand.  While  he  was  attempting  to  use  his  car’s  hands-free  system,  he
drifted into a parked car in his neighborhood. The owner of the vehicle was home and
witnessed the incident. The owner of the vehicle and Applicant exchanged words, and
the situation escalated. When he left the scene of the accident to drive home, he was
aware the woman intended to call the police. (GE 3 at 2-3; GE 7; Tr. 45-48, 61-62)
According  to  Applicant,  he  did  not  consume  any  alcohol  prior  to  the  incident.
After  he  arrived  home,  he  consumed  two  large  beers  to  calm  his  nerves.  The  police
arrived at Applicant’s home within 15 minutes, and the police officer could smell alcohol
on Applicant. Applicant refused to take field sobriety tests and a breathalyzer; therefore,
he  was  arrested  and  taken  to  jail.  The  next  day  when  he  was  released,  Applicant
contacted  his  FSO  and  reported  the  incident.  Upon  advice  from  his  attorney,  he  pled
guilty to DWI, and as a result, the refusal charge was dismissed. Applicant was ordered
to pay  a  $250 fine and  $216  court costs.  He  was  required  to  have  an  interlock  device
installed in his vehicle for six months and attend an ASAP class. Finally, his license was
restricted for a year from January 9, 2019. All the terms of this conviction were satisfied,
but his license remains restricted. (GE 3 at 2-3; GE 4; GE 7; GE 8; Tr. 48-53, 63-67)
At the time of the August 2018 DWI arrest, Applicant was unhappy at work, which
was  causing  stress  in  his  personal  life.  He  admittedly  used  alcohol  to  cope  with  his
unhappiness,  and  at  the  hearing  he  described  his  prior  alcohol  consumption  as
“maladaptive”.  The  last  time  Applicant  consumed  alcohol  was  the  night  of  his  August
2018 arrest. (Tr. 51-57, 68)
Applicant provided several letters of recommendation in his Answer to the SOR.
He  is  described  as  a  dedicated  family  man,  professional,  and  trustworthy.  In  his  2017
and  2018  performance  evaluations,  his  work  and  management  was  described  him  as
accountable, available, responsive, professional, successful, and compliant. Applicant is
heavily involved with coaching his sons’ baseball teams. (Answer; Tr. 56, 60)
