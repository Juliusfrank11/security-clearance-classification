In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, nearly all, or
parts thereof, of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR
(SOR ¶¶ 1.c. through 1.k.). Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein
as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record,
and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as an associate systems administrator with his current employer since September 2016.
He is a 1996 high school graduate. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in November 1996, and
he remained on active duty, including service in both Iraq and Afghanistan, until he was
honorably retired in December 2016. He was treated for  post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) in 2014. He was granted a secret clearance in 1996, and he reported that he was
granted access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) in 2012. He was married in
1999, and divorced in 2002. He remarried in 2004, and divorced in 2011.  He remarried
in 2011, and, after a separation of over one year, he was divorced in July 2019. He has
two children, born in 2000 and 2005.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can be found in the following exhibits: Item 5 (Combined Experian and TransUnion Credit
Report, dated May 10, 2018); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated May 6, 2019); Item 3
(e-QIP, dated April 3, 2018); Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated June 1, 2018);
and Item 2 (Applicant’s Answer to SOR, dated June 14, 2019).
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  difficulties  to  his  most  recent  separation  and
divorce, as well as contending that his ex-wife generated some bills in his name for her
own  children  who  were  merely  Applicant’s  former  step-children.  (Item  3,  at  46-51)
Because of the loss of his ex-wife’s income, Applicant did not generate sufficient funds to
maintain his financial accounts, and many of them became delinquent. Insufficient funds
apparently  did  not  stop  Applicant  from  what  might  be  construed  as  frivolous  or
irresponsible  spending,  for  in  January  2019  –  six  months  after  his  OPM  interview  –
Applicant purchased his third automobile for $34,000 with a monthly payment of $686.
He already had two other cars with  monthly payments of $866  and $544, as well as a
motorcycle  with  a  $579  monthly  payment.  (Item  6,  at  2-6)  Some  of  the  delinquent
accounts were charged off, and some were sold or transferred to debt purchasers.  He
reportedly engaged the services of a national law firm to assist him in improving his credit,
but he failed to submit any documentation to support his claim, and he failed to describe
what specific services they were to furnish him. (Item 3, at 46; Item4, at 7)
When  Applicant  completed  his  April  2018  e-QIP,  he  acknowledged  having  four
delinquent  accounts.  (Item  3,  at  47-51)  In  June  2018,  during  his  interview  with  an
investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant discussed
his  four  delinquent  accounts.  It  was  only  after  he  was  confronted  with  additional
delinquent accounts that he shared the facts associated with those accounts, and stated
that he was unaware that they were delinquent. (Item 4, at 9)
The  SOR  alleged  13  delinquent  accounts  totaling  approximately  $21,395.
Applicant described his repayment plans by claiming that he prioritizes his debts and pays
certain  “necessary”  debts  first.  He  also  stated  that  he  was  willing  to  sell  his  house  to
generate the equity in the home to pay off his remaining debt. (Item 4, at 9) Regarding
those accounts for which he had not yet taken any steps to resolve, Applicant indicated
in  June  2019  that  he  was  working  to  set  up  repayment  plans,  or  otherwise  get  them
resolved. (Item 2, at 1-2) The SOR allegations are set forth below:
SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b.: These are two medical accounts with unpaid balances of
$101 and $103 that were placed for collection. (Item 5, at 12; Item 6, at 1-2) Applicant
contended  that  his  ex-wife  used  Applicant’s  health  coverage  for  her  two  children  –
Applicant’s former step children – and that he was working to get those charges removed.
(Item 2, at 1; Item 4, at 8) He failed to submit documentation such as correspondence
with his health insurer or the creditor to support his contention. In the absence of such
documentation, I conclude that the accounts are not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c.: This is a bank-issued charge account with a $1,900 credit limit and a
past-due balance of $2,479 that was charged off. The account was subsequently sold to
a debt purchaser. (Item 5, at 13; Item 6, at 2, 7) Applicant admitted that he is indebted to
the creditor, but contended that he has been making agreed-upon unspecified “payments
through  company.”  (Item  2,  at  2)  He  submitted  a  payment  plan  calling  for  31  monthly
payments of $75.11, commencing on July 1, 2019 – over one month after the SOR was
issued – and there is an acknowledgement that the first payment was received by the
creditor.  The  second  payment  was  due  August  1,  2019,  nearly  three  weeks  before
Applicant’s Response to the FORM was due, but he failed to submit any documentation
to  indicate  that  the  payment  had  been  made.  (Account  Details,  dated  July  23,  2019,
attached  to  the  Response  to  the  FORM)  In  the  absence  of  such  documentation,  I
conclude that the account is not yet fully in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.d.: This is a bank-issued charge account with a $100 credit limit and a
past-due balance of $192. The account was subsequently sold to a debt purchaser. (Item
5, at 5; Item 6, at 2-3) Applicant admitted that he is indebted to the creditor, but contended
that he has been making agreed-upon unspecified “payments through company.” (Item
2, at 2) He did not identify the company to whom the payments were being made; nor did
he specify the amount of the payments, or when those payments commenced. He failed
to  submit  any  documentation,  such  as  a  statement  from  the  creditor  agreeing  to  a
repayment plan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts,
to support his contention that he has an agreement and that he is making any payments
to the creditor. In the absence of such documentation, I conclude that the account is not
yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.e.: This is a bank-issued charge account with a jewelry store with a $820
credit limit and a past-due balance of $750. The account was subsequently sold to a debt
purchaser. (Item 5, at 4; Item 6, at 3) Applicant admitted that he is indebted to the creditor,
but  contended  that  he  has  been  making  agreed-upon  unspecified  “payments  through
company.” (Item 2, at 2) He submitted a payment plan calling for 13 monthly payments of
$50,  commencing  on July  1,  2019  –  over one month after the  SOR  was  issued  –  and
there  is an  acknowledgement  that  the  first  payment  was  received  by  the  creditor. The
second  payment  was  due  August  1,  2019,  nearly  three  weeks  before  Applicant’s
Response to the FORM was due, but he failed to submit any documentation to indicate
that the payment had been made. (Account Details, dated July 23, 2019, attached to the
Response  to  the  FORM)  In  the  absence  of  such  documentation,  I  conclude  that  the
account is not yet fully in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.f.: This is a bank-issued charge account with a high credit of $4,851 and
an unpaid and past-due balance of $4,548. An unspecified amount was charged off. The
account was subsequently sold to a debt purchaser. (Item 5, at 13; Item 6, at 3) Applicant
admitted  that  he  is  indebted  to  the  creditor,  but  contended  that  he  has  been  making
agreed-upon  unspecified  “payments  through  company.”  (Item  2,  at  2)  He  submitted  a
payment plan calling for 43 monthly payments of $101.06, commencing on July 1, 2019
– over one month after the SOR was issued – and there is an acknowledgement that the
first payment was received by the creditor. The second payment was due August 1, 2019,
nearly three weeks before Applicant’s Response to the FORM was due, but he failed to
submit any documentation to indicate that the payment had been made. (Account Details,
dated  July  23,  2019,  attached  to  the  Response  to  the  FORM)  In  the  absence  of  such
documentation,  I  conclude  that  the  account  is  not  yet  fully  in  the  process  of  being
resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.g.: This is a bank-issued charge account with a $2,000 credit limit and an
unpaid  balance  of  $2,673  that  was  charged  off.  (Item  5,  at  13;  Item  6,  at  4)  Applicant
admitted that he is indebted to the creditor, but contended that he was working to set up
a  payment  plan.  (Item  2,  at  2)  He  submitted  a  payment  plan  calling  for  44  monthly
payments of $60.75, commencing on July 1, 2019 – over one month after the SOR was
issued  –  but  he  offered  no  evidence  that  the  payments  had  actually  started.  (Account
Details, dated July 23, 2019, attached to the Response to the FORM) In the absence of
such evidence, I conclude that the account is not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.h.: This is a bank-issued credit-card account with a $1,400 credit limit and
an unpaid and past-due balance of $1,635 that was charged off. (Item 5, at 14; Item 6, at
4-5)  Applicant  admitted  that  he  is  indebted  to  the  creditor,  but  contended  that  he  was
working to set up a payment plan. (Item 2, at 2) He submitted a settlement offer calling
for  six  monthly  payments  of  $109,  totaling  $654,  commencing  on  August  22,  2019  –
approximately three months after the SOR was issued – but he offered no evidence that
the offer had been agreed to by the creditor, or that the payments had actually started.
(Settlement Offer, dated August 15, 2019, attached to the Response to the FORM) In the
absence of such evidence, I conclude that the account is not yet in the process of being
resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.i.: This is a bank-issued credit-card account with a $4,600 credit limit and
an unpaid and past-due balance of $4,689. On an unspecified date, $4,739 was charged
off. (Item 5, at 14; Item 6, at 5-6) Applicant admitted that he is indebted to the creditor,
but contended that he was working to set up a payment plan. (Item 2, at 2) He failed to
submit any documentation, such as a statement from the creditor agreeing to a repayment
plan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support
his contention that he was working on an agreement or that he is making any payments
to the creditor. In the absence of such documentation, I conclude that the account is not
yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.j.: This is a bank-issued credit-card account with a $500 credit limit and
an unpaid and past-due balance of $842 that was charged off. (Item 5, at 4; Item 6, at 6)
Applicant admitted that he is indebted to the creditor, but contended that he was working
to set up a payment plan. (Item 2, at 2) He failed to submit any documentation, such as
a statement from the creditor agreeing to a repayment plan, cancelled checks, copies of
money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support his contention that he was working
on an agreement or that he is making any payments to the creditor. In the absence of
such  documentation,  I  conclude  that  the  account  is  not  yet  in  the  process  of  being
resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.k.: This is a bank-issued charge account with a $1,500 credit limit and an
unpaid balance of $2,817. An unspecified amount was charged off, and the account was
transferred or sold to a debt purchaser. (Item 5, at 11; Item 6, at 9) Applicant admitted
that he is indebted to the creditor, but contended that he was working to set up a payment
plan. (Item 2, at 2) He failed to submit any documentation, such as a statement from the
creditor agreeing to a repayment plan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank
register, or receipts, to support his contention that he was working on an agreement or
that he is making any payments to the creditor. In the absence of such documentation, I
conclude that the account is not yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.l.: This is an unspecified type of account with a pest-control company with
an unpaid  balance  of $297.  (Item 5,  at  12) Applicant denied  that he  is  indebted  to  the
creditor, and claimed that he had already paid off the account. (Item 2, at 2) He failed to
submit any documentation, such as a receipt from the creditor, cancelled checks, copies
of money orders, a bank register, to support his contention that the account had already
been paid off. In the absence of such documentation, I conclude that the account is not
yet in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.m.: This is cellular-telephone account with an unpaid balance of $219.
(Item 6, at 7; Item 5, at 14) Applicant denied that he is indebted to the creditor, and claimed
that he had already paid off the account. (Item 2, at 2) Applicant’s 2019 credit report noted
that there was a payment of $293 made in May 2018, and that there is no a zero balance.
(Item 6, at 7) I conclude that the account has been resolved.
As noted above, Applicant indicated that he was willing to sell his home in order to
generate the funds necessary to resolve his delinquent debts. However, as of April 2019,
when he made a mortgage payment of $1,180, the house had not been sold, and he still
had a mortgage of $212,589. (Item 4, at 9; Item 6, at 3) It is not known what Applicant’s
current  financial  resources  may  be  because  he  did  not  report  his  current  net  monthly
income;  monthly  expenses;  and  any  monthly  remainder  that  might  be  available  for
discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence
of  financial  counseling.  In  the  absence  of  additional  financial  information,  it  remains
difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had
been.
