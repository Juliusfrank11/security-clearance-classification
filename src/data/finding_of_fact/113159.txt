Applicant,  age  46,  is  married  with  three  minor  children  and  one  adult  child.  He
earned his high school diploma in 1991. He took online-college courses between 2010
and  2011,  without  earning  a  degree.  He  served  honorably  in  the  U.S.  Marine  Corps,
from  1992  until  he  retired  in  July  2012.  He  has  been  employed  as  a  software  testing
engineer  by  the  same  defense  contractor  since  then.  He  has  maintained  his  security
clearance since 1992. (Item 2 at 4; Items 3 and 4)
Without  specifying  details  about  his  relevant  income  and  expense  history,
Applicant asserted that his income decreased with his civilian job and did not suffice to
meet  his  familyâ€™s  expenses.  He  had  not  accounted  for  how  much  higher  the  cost  of
living would be once he transitioned out of base housing, in which he had lived during
the  prior  15  years.  Between  2013  and  2014,  he  fell  behind  with  payments  to  his
creditors  and  then  chose  to  pay  living  expenses  over  his  other  debts.  Eventually,  he
opted  to  allow  those  other  debts  to  be  sent  to  collections  and  charged  off  rather  than
resolve them. He received financial counseling and was advised not to file bankruptcy.
In  June  2018,  Applicant  declared  that  his  finances  were  stable  and  that  he  was  living
within his means. He reaffirmed  the same in June 2019. (Item 2 at 4;  Item 3 at 29-33;
Item 4 at 4)
The  SOR  alleged  24  delinquent  accounts,  the  balances  of  which  totaled
$106,868, and two delinquent  accounts, with no specified  balance, consisti ng  primarily
of  credit-card  and  loan  debts  in  either  charged-off  or  collection  status.  Appl icant
admitted to all  but one $37 medical account, of which  he claimed to have no knowledge.
That debt is confirmed  by his 2017 credit report. He  does not plan  to resolve  any of his
admitted  SOR  debts  based  on  his  belief that  they  are  no  longer  in  delinquent  status
since they were  all  reported as charged  off and closed on  his recent credit report.  (Item
2 at 4 ; Items 5 and 6)
