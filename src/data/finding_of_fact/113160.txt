Financial Considerations
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b allege Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return
for tax year 2015 and his state tax return for tax year 2015. Applicant prepared his 2015
federal income tax return; however, he did not mail it to the IRS. (Tr. 33-34) He lost track
of his 2015 federal income tax return on his cluttered desk. (Tr. 33) His work schedule was
demanding and hectic, and he did not give a high-enough priority to getting his 2015 tax
returns filed. (Tr. 33-34) He mostly attributed the failure to file his 2015 federal income tax
return to an oversight. (Tr. 38) According to his 2015 federal income tax return, he owes
the  IRS $14,000.  (Tr. 35-36; AE  B)  He plans  to file  the  2015 federal income tax  return
soon.  (Tr.  39)  He  did  not  timely  file  his  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2011
through 2018, although several of those years could have been filed within the extension
periods. (Tr. 44) His state tax returns for those same years were not timely filed. (Tr. 44-
45)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant owes federal income taxes of about $6,000 for tax year
2016. He acknowledged that he owed the tax debt for tax year 2016. (Tr. 33, 36) He did
not resolve his federal tax debt for five reasons: (1) procrastination; (2) busy with heavy
demands from work; (3) family issues; (4) use of funds for travel; and (5) payments of 25
percent of his income to address his state income tax debt. (Tr. 37-39) The family issues
involved  custody  of  his  daughter  and  taking  his  children  to  sporting  events.  (Tr.  38)  In
September 2019, he completed an online payment agreement with the IRS relating to his
2011 to 2016 federal income taxes. (Tr. 40-41; AE D) He estimated his federal tax debt to
be about $35,000 including tax year 2015. (Tr. 41-42) His first payment of $521 was made
to the IRS in September 2019 under his payment plan. (Tr. 36, 42-43)

the state tax authority filed six tax liens against Applicant. (Tr. 49) Applicant had a wage
garnishment to collect a $47,000 state tax debt. (Tr. 46) All of Applicant’s state income
taxes are now paid. (Tr. 45, 48-51; AE E) He believed he filed his state income tax return
for tax year 2015. (Tr. 45-46; AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant has a past-due vehicle financing debt for $1,255. One
of Applicant’s payments was returned for insufficient funds, and the creditor reported the
debt as past due. (Tr. 58) The debt is now current. (Tr. 58-59; AE G)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges Applicant has a charged-off account for $1,285. Applicant rented
furniture  in  2010,  and  the  most  recent  payment  was  in  2011.  (Tr.  59-60)  Applicant
contacted  the  creditor,  and  the  creditor  was  unable  to  locate  the  debt.  (Tr.  59-60)  The
account is closed. (Tr. 59-60)
Applicant’s current annual base salary is about $200,000 with a potential $30,000
bonus. (Tr. 26-27) Applicant is current on his student loan payments. (Tr. 23) He has not
had any financial counseling. (Tr. 61) Now that the state-wage garnishment is complete,
he has the available funds to maintain currency on his debt and to establish and complete
an IRS payment plan. (Tr. 65) He has been entrusted with sensitive information during
his career, and he has conscientiously protected the information. (Tr. 64-65)

professional who makes significant contributions to his employers. (AE I)
