In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  39-year-old  nuclear  quality-control  inspector  employed  by  a
defense  contractor  since  May  2018.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from
January  2001  to  January  2015.  He  was  involuntarily  discharged,  with  an  honorable
discharge,  under  the  Navy’s  high-tenure  rule  (failure  to  be  promoted).  He  was
unemployed  from  February  to  October  2015.  He  worked  in  the  private  sector  from
October 2015 until he was hired for his current job.  He held a security clearance while
on active duty, but it expired because of the  time gap between his discharge from the
Navy and his employment by a defense contractor.
Applicant married in May 2002 and has three children, ages 19, 16, and 13.  He
enrolled in a community college immediately after being discharged, and he received an
associate’s degree in February 2017.
The SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts totaling about $31,496. Six of the debts are
student loans totaling about $29,831. The debts are reflected in credit reports from May
2019  and  August  2018  (GX  3  and  4.)  The  evidence  concerning  the  delinquent  debts
alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.e:  credit-card  accounts  charged  off  for  $436  and  428;
collection  account  for  $281;  telecommunication  account  placed  for  collection  of
$170; and utility bill placed for collection of $149. As of the date the record closed,
Applicant had taken no action to resolve these debts.
SOR  ¶  1.f:  government  debt  for  overpayment  of  tuition,  placed  for
collection  of  $201.  This  bill  was  incurred  when  Applicant  failed  to  pass  a  college
course paid for under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. He testified that this debt  was resolved by
diversion of his federal income tax refund, and he is again attending classes using his
GI  Bill  benefits.  (Tr. 27,  33-34.)  The  May  2019  credit  report  reflects  that  the  debt  was
paid. (GX 3 at 3.)
SOR  ¶¶  1.g-1.l:  student  loans  totaling  about  $29,831.  In  August  2019,
Applicant  entered  into  a  rehabilitation  program  for  his  delinquent  student  loans,
providing  for nine monthly  payments of $47. (AX  A.) As  of  the  date  of  the hearing,  he
had made the first three monthly payments. (AX B.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  incurred  moving  expenses  when  he  moved  from
another state to accept his current job, and he received some financial assistance from
his current employer for the costs of moving. (Tr. 21.) He also testified that he obtained
for  car  maintenance  and  repairs.  (Tr.  24.)  However,  he  provided  no
loans
documentation to corroborate his testimony.
Applicant’s current gross pay is about $47,800 per year. His wife is not employed
outside  the  home.  He  estimates  that  his  net  monthly  remainder  after  paying  all  his
financial obligations and living expenses is about $100. (Tr. 23.) He has not sought or
received financial counseling.
