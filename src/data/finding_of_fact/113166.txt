In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with extensive comments, nearly all
of the SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.i.,
1.k.,  1.o.,  and  1.p.).  As  for  the  allegations  he  denied,  he  submitted  documentation
associated  with  those  accounts  identified.  Applicant’s  admissions  and  comments  are
incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the
evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due  consideration  of  same,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a mechanic with his current employer since March 2018. He previously served as a
detention  officer  with  the  local  sheriff’s  department  from  November  2016  until  March
2018,  and  also  held  part-time  positions  with  auto  parts  stores  from  August  2015  until
November  2016.  A  2006  high  school  graduate,  Applicant  attended  a  local  community
college as a part-time student for a little over one year, and received some credits, but no
degree. He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) in August 2006, and he served on
active  duty  in  the  United  States  and  Okinawa,  Japan,  until  he  was  honorably  and
medically discharged as a sergeant (E-5), and awarded a 100 percent disability. He was
granted a secret clearance on an unspecified date. He was married in 2009, separated in
2012, and divorced in 2013.  He remarried in 2013, and separated in 2017. His present
marital status is not reported. He has no children.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can  be  found  in  the  following  exhibits:  Item  5  (Combined  Experian,  TransUnion,  and
Equifax Credit Report, dated September 25, 2018); Item 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated
April  29,  2019);  Item  6  (Enhanced  Subject  Interview,  dated  January  15,  2019);  Item  2
(Applicant’s  Answer  to  SOR,  dated  July  16,  2019);  Item  2  (TransUnion  Credit  Report,
dated  July  1,  2019,  attached  to  Applicant’s  Answer  to  the  SOR  Answer);  and  Item  2
(Equifax Credit Report, dated July 1, 2019, attached to Applicant’s Answer to the SOR
Answer).
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  his  two  failed  marriages  and  his
disability.  His  first  wife  ran  up  his  credit  card  balances  while  he  was  away  at  training.
During  his  separation  from  his  first  wife,  he  was  required  to  pay  her  $985  in  monthly
alimony, and one-half of his basic housing allowance was directed to her. That situation
continued for 13 months. As a corporal with the USMC, his income was depleted. When
he remarried, he had to establish a new home with furniture and household items, and he
needed a vehicle for his new wife to get to work. In September 2015, he was medically
retired, and he found it hard to hold a steady job due to the injuries he had sustained while
on active duty.  Eventually, his wife lost her job, and with very little money left after his
divorce, he and his new wife struggled financially for five years before finally separating.
(Item 2, at 1-2; Item 6, at 17-18)
When  Applicant  completed  his  SF  86  in August  2018,  he  acknowledged having
one delinquent automobile-loan account. (Item 3, at 40-42)  In January 2019, during his
interview  with  an  investigator  from  the  U.S.  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM),
Applicant  discussed  that  automobile-loan  account  as  well  as  a  number  of  additional
delinquent accounts. He stated that his home was flooded by a category 4 hurricane in
mid-September  2018,  and  he  lost  all  of  his  bills  and  property,  and/or  he  lost  track  of
everything. He acknowledged that he now had a steady check coming in, and he intended
to  start  calling  his  creditors  at  the  beginning  of  February  2019  in  an  effort  to  work  on
payment plans or possibly eliminate some of the interest on his debts. His repayment plan
was to address other debts first, and then start working on these smaller debts before
attempting to resolve the larger ones. He claimed to have altered his actions by no longer
using credit cards, and only purchasing items for which he has cash in hand. (Item 6, at
18)
The SOR alleged 18 delinquent accounts totaling approximately $76,530, as set
forth as follows: SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.e., 1.h., 1.i., 1.k., and 1.p.: various accounts with
past-due and unpaid balances of $28,813, $13,529, $5,281, $4,133, $3,328, $806, $443,
$80, and $12,101 that were charged off, that Applicant admits are delinquent; SOR ¶¶
1.f. and 1.g.: two cellular telephone accounts with unpaid balances of $2,826 and $842,
that Applicant admits are delinquent. (Item 4, at 1-33; Item 5, at 5-7; Item 2, at 1-2) There
is  SOR  ¶  1.q.:  a  credit-card  account  with  a  past-due  balance  of  $398  and  an  unpaid
balance of $2,745, that Applicant acknowledged that he owed, but when he obtained his
July 2019 credit reports, the account, which became delinquent in 2013, appeared in the
TransUnion credit report reflecting a zero balance, and it no longer appears in his Equifax
credit report. (Item 5, at 8; Item 6, at 13; Item 2 (TransUnion Credit Report, at 14); Item 2
(Equifax Credit Report)) There is SOR ¶ 1.r.: a cellular telephone account with an unpaid
balance  of  $825  that  was  sold  or  transferred  to  a  debt  collector  or  purchaser,  that
Applicant acknowledged that he owed, but when he obtained his July 2019 credit reports,
the account, which became delinquent in 2013, no longer appears in the 2019 TransUnion
or Equifax credit reports. (Item 5, at 13; Item 6, at 13; Item 2 (TransUnion Credit Report);
Item 2 (Equifax Credit Report))
In addition,  there are SOR  ¶¶  1.j., and  1.l.  through 1.o.: five medical  debts  with
unpaid balances of $244, $48, $30, $30, and $28. (Item 4, at 2-3; Item 5, at 13; Item 6, at
12-13;  Item  2,  at  1-2)  Applicant  denied  owing  four  of  the  debts,  claiming  that  he  had
already paid them off, but he admitted that one such account, with the $28 balance, is
delinquent, but which he claims was recently transferred to another collection agent, and
would probably be removed from his credit report because of the small balance. (Item 6,
at 2) Applicant was apparently confused, for he submitted documentation to indicate that
on July 1, 2019, he paid off three accounts with the balances of $48, $30, and $28. (Item
2  (Receipt,  dated  July  1,  2019)  The  accounts  with  unpaid  balances  of  $244  and  $30
remain unpaid.
During  periods  of  financial  difficulties,  although  Applicant  claimed  that  he  had
insufficient  funds  to  maintain  certain  accounts  in  a  current  status,  he  managed  to
purchase jewelry for $3,000; a boat for $4,000; an automobile stereo set for about $3,000;
and a truck for $36,000. (Item 6, at 12, 14-16)
Other  than  Applicant’s  unverified  contentions  regarding  his  expenses  and  his
efforts  to  resolve  certain  delinquent  accounts,  there  is  no  documentary  evidence  to
support that Applicant made any efforts to address any of his delinquent accounts until
July 1, 2019 – six months after the OPM interview and three weeks after the SOR was
issued. With the exception of three relatively minor medical accounts ($48, $30, and $28),
Applicant’s delinquent accounts have not been resolved.
It is not known what Applicant’s current financial resources may be because he did
not report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder
that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a
budget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of additional financial
information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position
financially than he had been.
