The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the June 12, 2019 SOR, Applicant
owed charged-off debts of $29,925 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and $18,124 (SOR ¶ 1.b). When Applicant
answered  the  SOR  allegations,  he  admitted  the  debts,  explaining  that  they  had  been
included in a debt-repayment program but had not been resolved when he withdrew from
the program in February 2017 after settling a smaller credit-card delinquency. He explained
that he realized then that the program was “useless” in that it would take him years to
accrue enough money to pay off the two large delinquencies. (Items 2-3.) After considering
the FORM, which includes Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, and Applicant’s responses to
the FORM (AEs A-B), I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 55-year-old high school graduate. He has been married to his current
spouse since January 2001. He was married to his first wife from May 1985 to May 1996.
He has a son age 30 and a daughter age 32. He also has two stepdaughters ages 33 and
27. (Items 4-5.)
Applicant retired from the U.S. military at the rank of sergeant first class on October
1, 2010, after three years in the U.S. Reserve and 24 years of active duty. He was granted
a secret clearance following a security clearance investigation completed in approximately
April 1998. In November 2009, his security clearance eligibility was revoked for financial
reasons. Applicant’s clearance was reinstated in 2010 after he paid off some old bills from
his divorce.  (Items 2, 4.)
For the first year after his retirement, Applicant worked for a defense contractor as a
human resource specialist in Afghanistan. Since November 2011, he has been employed
by a defense contractor in the United States as a subject matter expert on the GI bill.
(Items 2, 4.) Applicant’s worksite from November 2011 to June 2015 was on a military base
in another state. He stayed in a hotel during the work week and returned home on the
weekends. Applicant has primarily teleworked out of his home since June 2015.  (Item 4.)
In addition to his employment income, he receives disability pay from the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) and his military pension. (Item 2.)
On  January  17,  2018,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire  for National Security  Positions  (SF 86) to  update  his security clearance
eligibility. He responded affirmatively to financial record inquiries concerning whether he
had an account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled in the last seven years
for failing to pay as agreed; whether he had defaulted on any loan in the last seven years;
and whether he had any bills turned over to a collection agency in the last seven years. He
reported  that  he  owed  a  credit-card  debt  of  $18,000  in  collection  (SOR  ¶  1.b) that  he
attempted to resolve, but he could not afford the payment required by the collection entity.
He also disclosed that he had defaulted on a loan of $29,000 (SOR ¶ 1.a) that was in
collection status, and explained:
Entered into debt relief Freedom Debt Relief (FDR), required to pay money
into an account that does NOT pay the main creditor directly until you have
enough money in an account to cover about 20%, thus the loan became
delinquent. I withdrew to pay on my own. I attempted [on] several occasions
to settle account but could not afford their unreasonable offer.
As for the current status of the  loan debt, Applicant stated, “Still with collection,
latest offer is a full amount of $11,969.86 which I cannot afford.” He indicated he had made
no payments on the debt. (Item 4.)
Applicant’s credit report of February 6, 2018, showed the  delinquent credit-card
account had been charged off for $18,124 in February 2017. He owed $29,925 on the
defaulted loan, which had been charged off for $27,463 in October 2016. Applicant had
settled a credit-card collection debt of $1,014 in November 2016. He was making timely
payments  on  a  credit  card  with  a  $4,174  balance,  and  on  four  installment  loans  with
balances totaling $35,506.  (Item 7.)
On December 10, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator. He
described his financial situation as “good” and stated that he was meeting all his financial
obligations. About his two large delinquencies disclosed on his SF 86, he explained that he
attempted  to  resolve  the  $18,124  credit-card  delinquency  through  the  debt-repayment
program, but that the creditor wanted too much to settle the debt. He had acquired the
$29,925 loan to consolidate his debts, but he then could not afford to settle the debt. While
acknowledging that he had settled a smaller credit-card debt through the debt-repayment
program, he stated that he should never have attempted to address his debts through the
program because “the plan had no end in sight.” He explained that he had accrued the
credit balances for family vacations, and for his living and travel expenses while living apart
from his family. (Item 5.)
Applicant’s credit reports of February 2018 and May 2019 reveal a history since
2013 of reliance on loans, in some cases taking on higher debt in refinancing. (Items 6-7.)
In April 2018, he paid off a $27,088 loan by refinancing for a new loan of $20,522, requiring
repayment at $868 per month. As of May 2019, he was making his loan payments on time.
He  was  also  making  payments  of  $279  per  month  on  a  $15,000  loan  obtained  in
September 2015 (balance $7,332 as of May 2019). In January 2019, he paid off a $3,137
loan  held  since  July  2018  through  a  refinancing  for  a  new  loan  of  $7,008,  requiring
repayment at $330 per month. That loan had a reported balance of $7,280 as of May 2019,
so it is unclear whether he had started repaying that newer loan. Applicant was making
payments  on  two  credit  cards  with  balances  of  $5,815  and  $1,568.  He  had  no  new
delinquencies on his credit record, but he had not made any payments toward the charged-
off debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. (Item 6.)
On  June  12,  2019,  the  DOD  CAF  issued  an  SOR  to  Applicant  because  of  his
charged-off debts totaling $48,049. (Item 1.) On June 27, 2019, Applicant explained about
the debt-repayment program that he did not realize that his payments into the program
were  held  until  he  reached  an  amount  that  was  enough  to  pay  off  a  debt,  and  that
payments were not being disbursed to each of the creditors on a monthly basis. While he
managed  to  resolve  one  credit-card  debt  through  the  program,  he  withdrew  from  the
program in February 2017 because it would take him years to accumulate enough money
in his account to pay off the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. Applicant asserted that he lived
within his means and was paying all of his current debts. (Item 2.)
On his receipt of the FORM on August 2, 2019, Applicant contacted the collection
entities handling his defaulted accounts. He received settlement offers of $10,473 for his
loan debt (SOR ¶ 1.a) and $9,968 for the credit-card debt (SOR ¶ 1.b). The payment to
settle the loan was due on or before August 9, 2019. Applicant immediately requested a
hardship  withdrawal  of  $23,000  from  his  401(k),  which  would  net  him  approximately
$21,352 after taxes and fees. On August 9, 2019, he was denied a hardship withdrawal
because debt settlement was not a reason approved by the IRS for a hardship withdrawal.
Applicant also attempted to obtain a loan from his bank, but it was disapproved. He asked
friends and family members for some financial assistance to no avail. On August 15, 2019,
he advised DOHA that he had “exhausted all possible avenues” regarding resolving the
debts, but he would continue to remain in contact with the collection entities about the
debts. (AE A.) On August 20, 2019, Applicant informed DOHA that the collection entity for
the credit-card debt (SOR ¶ 1.b) was willing to accept 12 monthly payments to settle the
debt,  but  the  monthly  payment  of approximately $830 “is quite a steep amount to pay
monthly for [his] budget.” He reiterated that he would remain in contact with his creditors.
(AE  B.)  Applicant  presented  no  information about his  employment income, his military
retirement  income,  or  his  monthly  living  expenses,  so  it  is  unclear  what  he  could  pay
toward his delinquencies.
