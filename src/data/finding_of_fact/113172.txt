In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c
and 1.e. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.f. His admissions in his answer
and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor providing training and
certification for Navy sailors. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from April 1998
to August 2018, and retired as a chief petty officer (pay grade E-7). He spent about 13 of
his 20-plus years of active duty at sea and relied heavily on his wife to manage the family
finances. (AX 8; Tr. 50-53.) He has worked for defense contractors since his retirement.
He  held  a  security  clearance  in  the  Navy  and  retained  it  when  he  began  working  for
contractors.
Applicant married in May 2002 and has an adult foster daughter. His wife passed
away on November 5, 2019, after the hearing. Her passing triggered several changes in
Applicant’s financial affairs, which were addressed in his post-hearing submission.
The SOR alleges six delinquent debts, which are reflected in credit reports from
January 2018 and June 2019. (GX 2; GX 4.) The evidence concerning these debts is set
out below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: military credit-card account past due for $39, with a total balance
of $1,575. Applicant fell behind on his payments after he retired and the bills continued
to be sent to his old address. He notified the creditor that his address had changed, and
he now makes payments by automatic debit. As of September 6, 2019, the account was
current. (AX 1.)
SOR ¶ 1.b: credit-card account referred for collection of $1,020. Applicant’s
wife  opened  this  account,  using  a  power  of  attorney,  while  Applicant  was  deployed  in
2015. The collection agency agreed to settle the debt for $306, which Applicant paid on
July 26, 2019. (AX 2.)
SOR ¶ 1.c: credit-card account referred for collection of $569. Applicant’s wife
opened this account during a failed business attempt. The creditor offered to settle the
debt for $228. Applicant accepted the offer and paid it on August 1, 2019. (AX 3.)
SOR  ¶  1.d:  credit-card  account  referred  for  collection  of  $448.  Applicant
disputed this debt, and it was determined by the creditor to be fraudulent. In November
2018, the creditor asked the three credit-reporting agencies to delete this debt. (AX 4.)
The debt is not reflected in the June 2019 credit report. (GX 4.)
SOR ¶ 1.e: real-estate mortgage loan past due for $32,243, with a balance of
$165,849. Applicant and his wife purchased a home in 2005, while he was on shore duty.
He obtained a VA loan for the entire purchase price of about $151,000. (Tr. 72; GX 2 at
6.)  At  the  time  they  bought  the  house,  it  was  near  the  Navy  training  facility  for  sailors
holding his rating, and he expected to have multiple assignments nearby and eventually
live in the home after he retired. However, his promotion to chief petty officer made him
ineligible for most of the positions at the nearby training facility.
From 2007 to 2017, Applicant was assigned to ships homeported more than 100
miles from his home, and he spent a total of about 13 years at sea. He and his wife tried
to  sell  the  house  in  2008,  but  they  were  unsuccessful  because  of  the  downturn  in  the
housing market. They were unable to rent the house because it is located in a rural area
that  is  not  densely  populated.  In  2012,  Applicant’s  wife  began  suffering  from  multiple
medical problems. She decided to live in the house until 2014, when her health problems
made it necessary for her to live closer to her family and medical care. The house was
vacant until they rented the house in 2016. Applicant lived aboard the ship to which he
was assigned, and his wife lived in another state near her family and medical providers.
They fell behind on the mortgage-loan payments because of the expense of maintaining
it along with a separate residence for his wife. At the time of the hearing, Applicant had
retired, and he and his wife maintained separate households. She lived near her family
and medical care-givers, and he lived near his current workplace. The house is still rented,
but it is 80 years old and requires extensive maintenance and repairs. (Tr. 49-55.) The
tenants pay rent of $700, but the mortgage-loan payment is $944. (GX 2 at 6; Tr. 49-55,
78.)
Applicant has never sought or obtained financial counseling. (Tr. 86.) However, in
July 2019, Applicant contacted a realtor specializing in assistance to veterans with VA
loans. (AX 5.) The realtor is assisting him in seeking approval for a short sale of the home.
(AX 12) The realtor testified that it probably will take 60-90 days to obtain approval from
the lender for a short sale. (Tr. 24.) On November 15, Applicant was contacted by a listing
realtor, who is anxious to sell the house. (AX 17.) As of the date the record closed, the
delinquent mortgage loan was not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.f: medical bill referred for collection of $365. This debt was charged
off in 2013. Applicant contacted the collection agency and was informed that it does not
have an open account for it.
The passing of Applicant’s wife significantly changed his financial situation. He is
the beneficiary of a $50,000 life insurance policy. His retired pay will increase because
the monthly deduction of $148 for the Survivor Benefit Plan has terminated. He plans to
use the insurance money to pay his wife’s funeral expenses, outstanding medical bills,
and several debts, leaving a balance of about $29,000, which he will use to either fix up
the house for sale or resolve the past-due payments. He estimates that his net monthly
remainder  after  all  debt  payments  and  monthly  expenses  will  increase  from  $926  to
$3,667. (AX 16; AX 18.)
Applicant’s  manager,  a  retired  Navy  captain,  has  daily  contact  with  him  and
regards  him  as  reliable  and  trustworthy,  notwithstanding  his  delinquent  mortgage
payments.  (AX  9.)  Applicant’s  team  leader,  also  a  retired  Navy  officer,  considers  him
trustworthy  and  honest.  (AX  10.)  One  of  Applicant’s  co-workers,  a  retired  senior  chief
petty officer, who works daily with Applicant and travels with him frequently, has observed
that Applicant is meticulous about safeguarding the large amount of classified information
required for their job. He considers Applicant trustworthy, committed, and loyal. (AX 11.)
