In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied, with brief comments, all of the factual
allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.h.). Applicant’s
comments  are  incorporated  herein  as  potential  findings  of  fact.  After  a  complete  and
thorough  review  of  the  evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon due  consideration of  same, I
make the following additional findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a software engineer with his current employer since April 2018. He has also held a
part-time position as a site manager from October 2016 until at least May 2018 where
children  were  taught music and  arts  using technology.  He  initially  enlisted  in  the  Army
Reserve in March 2002; was commissioned in May 2007; and continued serving until July
2016, when he was honorably discharged. He received a bachelor’s degree in 2007 and
a master’s degree in 2011. (Item 3) He was granted a secret clearance in 2007. (Item 7)
He was married in 2010. He has two children, born in 2012 and 2017.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can  be  found  in  the  following  exhibits:  Item  5  (Combined  Experian,  TransUnion,  and
Equifax Credit Report, dated May 30, 2018); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated May
31, 2019); Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated January 16, 2019); Item 2 (SF 86,
dated May 4, 2018); and Item 2 (Applicant’s Answer to SOR, dated August 19, 2019).
In his SF 86, Applicant listed one defaulted student loan, in the amount of $8,500,
and he  claimed that  he  was  working  to  consolidate over $31,500 in  student  loans.  He
noted  that  his  student  loans  “backed  up”  when  he  was  out  of  work.  (Item  3,  at  38-39)
Applicant left some jobs when the contracts on which he was working expired, and he left
another  position  because  the  commute  was  too  far.  He  continued  to  take  classes
regardless of his employment situation. During his interview with an investigator from the
U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in January 2019, Applicant reported that he
was unemployed from October 2016 until April 2017, and from June 2017 until November
2017, but that information differs from what he reported in his SF 86. (Item 4, at 27-28;
Item 3, at 13) He also acknowledged that his student loan financial issues started in 2011
or  2012  when  he  failed  to  realize  that  student  loans  had  to  be  paid  starting  upon
graduation.  (Item  4,  at  6)  He  did  not  indicate  whether  he  ever  sought  deferment  or
forbearance of his student loans. He reported that his federal income tax refunds for the
tax years 2016 through 2018 were applied towards his delinquent student loans. (Item 4,
at 6) He stated that he had contacted his loan lenders and loan servicing agents to set up
repayment agreements, but he was unable to comply with those agreements when he
became unemployed. (Item 4)
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant contended that from 2016 until 2018, he did
not have a job, and claimed that during that period, his then-pregnant wife broke her leg
and he became her 24/7 caretaker. (Item 2, at 3) It should be noted that his wife gave
birth in October 2017. (Item 3, at 26) Applicant failed to submit any documents such as
statements from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reflecting the attachment of income
tax  refunds;  statements  from  the  creditors  agreeing  to  a  repayment  plan;  cancelled
checks,  copies  of  money  orders,  a  bank  register,  or  receipts,  to  indicate  that  any  tax
attachments  has  taken  place,  agreements  had  been  made  with  creditors,  or  that  any
payments had been made to any creditor.
The  SOR  alleged  eight  delinquent  student-loan  accounts  totaling  approximately
$74,915. Those allegations are set forth as follows: SOR ¶ 1.a.: a loan with a high credit
of $16,347 and past-due and unpaid balance of $23,478 (Item 6, at 2; Item 5, at 8); SOR
¶ 1.b.: a loan with a high credit of $18,994 and past-due and unpaid balance of $18,394
(Item 6, at 2; Item 5, at 8); SOR ¶ 1.c.: a loan with a high credit of $3,038 and past-due
and unpaid balance of $4,363 (Item 6, at 2; Item 5, at 8); SOR ¶ 1.d.: a loan with a high
credit of $5,403 and past-due and unpaid balance of $4,009 (Item 6, at 2; Item 5, at 7); a
loan with a high credit of $5,403 and past-due and unpaid balance of $3,821 (Item 6, at
2; Item 5, at 6); SOR ¶ 1.e.: a loan with a high credit of $5,403 and past-due and unpaid
balance of $3,821 (Item 6, at 2; Item 5, at 6); SOR ¶ 1.f.: a loan with an unpaid balance
of $8,540 (Item 5, at 9); and SOR ¶ 1.h.: a loan with an unpaid balance of $8,528 (Item
5,  at  9)  All  but  the  last  two  accounts  were  placed  for  collection,  and  the  remaining
accounts were assigned to the government.
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant cryptically referred to “FFEL,” listed various
dollar numbers and percentage rates, and stated that one account with an unpaid balance
of $18,394 “seems to be a duplicate account,” but failed to identify the claimed duplicate
account,  and  identified  one  account  with  an  unpaid  balance  of  $8,528  as  a  duplicate
account, but once again failed to identify the claimed duplicate account. (Item 2, at 1-2,
4) In the absence of further commentary and explanation by Applicant, his notes are  of
very little value. FFEL stands for the Federal Family Education Loan Program, a system
of  private  student  loans  which  were  subsidized  and  guaranteed  by  the  United  States
federal government. The program issued loans from 1965 until it was ended in 2010. The
only difference between the loans is that one was issued by a financial institution and the
other was  issued by  the  government  itself.  FFEL  loans  were  also  insured by  guaranty
agencies. (https://www2ed.gov/programs/ffel)
It is not known what Applicant’s current financial resources may be because he did
not report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder
that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a
budget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of additional financial
information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position
financially than he had been.
