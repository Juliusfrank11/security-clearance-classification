The   SOR   identifies  three   delinquent  credit   card  debts   totaling   $24,563.  The
accounts, which Applicant is individually  liable for,  became  delinquent between  August
and   November  2016.  In   her  answer  to   the   SOR,  she   admitted   she   owes  the   debts.
Applicant  explained   that  the   first  two   credit   card   debts,   were  caused   by   a   divorce  and
child   custody   issues.  The   cards   were  used   to   pay   attorney   fees,   living   expenses,   and
children’s  clothes,   when   alimony   and   child   support  payments   were  either  modified   or
suspended.  Applicant   lost   her  car  and   sustained   major  damage   to   her  home   by   a
hurricane   in   September 2018. She   and   her new   husband  have   a  budget   and,   with   the
help   of her husband’s  retirement loan, they  will  repay  the  debts  in  full  by  December 1,
2019. The  third  account (SOR 1.c) became  delinquent  when  her former husband  never
paid for dental services that he  charged  to  the  account.  In  the  future, Applicant intends:
(1) to  stop  purchasing  items  she  cannot  afford; and  (2)  to  live  within her  means.  (Item  4
at 10-12; Item  5 at 3, 13; Item 6  at 3; answer to SOR)
Applicant is 48 years old. She has four daughters from her former husband whom
she married in 1994 and divorced in January 2015. She has been working on a part-time
basis for a survivalist team since March 2017. Her previous jobs were retail cashier (part
time) and construction administrator. She was an office manager for her former husband’s
security  firm  from  July  2009  to  February  2016.  In  December  2000,  she  received  a
certificate in medical transcription. She attended college part time and online in 2012 and
2015, but did not receive a degree. She has never been investigated or held a security
clearance. (Item 3 at 15-18, 44; Item 4 at 7)
Following  three  separations  from  her  former  husband,  with  the  most  recent
separation  in  January  2013,  Applicant  filed  for  divorce  in  September  2014,  and  was
granted a divorce in January 2015. She received alimony and child support which was
reduced when one daughter became 18 years old. At other times, the former husband did
not regularly pay alimony and child support. She lost her alimony when she moved in with
her  then-boyfriend  in November  2017.  Applicant  indicated  they  married  on  August  10,
2018, before the September 2018 hurricane swept through the area and  damaged her
property. (Item 4 at 7; answer to SOR)
In  her  September  11,  2019  response  to  the  FORM,  Applicant  indicated  she
intended to begin  payments  to  the  three  listed  creditors on  October 1, 2019.  She also
noted she had settled numerous unlisted debts. (September 2011 response to FORM)
In the additional information that she submitted on November 7, 2019, she provided
documented payments to the SOR 1.a creditor on October 31 and November 4, 2019.
She provided a documented payment to the SOR 1.b creditor on November 1, 2019. She
made a documented payment to the SOR 1.c creditor on October 4 and October 30, 2019.
She claimed that she made a payment  to the SOR 1.c creditor on November 7, 2019.
However, her payment ledger reflects that this payment was made on November 1, 2019.
(A2R at 3-7)
Though Applicant claimed in her September 2019 response to the FORM that she
had settled numerous unlisted accounts, she only submitted documentation of two credit
card accounts that are in a current status. (A2R at 10-13)
Returning  to  her  March  2018  PSI,  she  informed  the  OPM  investigator  that  she
settled  an  account  (#3499920975428883)  in the  summer  of  2017  for  about  $300.  The
applicable credit bureau report show that Applicant paid the charged off account (same
account  number)  in  August  2017.  The  same  credit  report  displays  only  the  three
delinquent debts listed in the SOR. Before her current payment plan, she never attempted
to  settle  or  arrange  a  payment  plan  with  the  three  listed  creditors.  Though  there  are
balances on three or four other unlisted accounts, there are no amounts appearing in the
“past due” column of the report. (Item 6 at 1-7)
