Applicant is a 32-year-old program analyst, employed by a government contractor
since  November  2017.  He  was  unemployed  from  September  to  November  2017.  He
earned a general educational development (GED) certification in 2006, and completed
some technical college studies. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 2008 until
2014, and deployed to Iraq. He was honorably discharged in November 2014. He married

The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  F  that  Applicant  is  delinquent  on  six  debts
totaling over $26,000. These consumer debts were either charged off or in a collection
status.  The  four  largest  debts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  –  1.d)  were  discussed  during  Applicant’s
personal subject interview with a government investigator. Applicant admitted the SOR
allegations and provided some explanations. He noted that it was challenging to find work
after leaving active duty and difficult to earn enough income to support his family. His wife
worked to supplement the family income, but difficult work schedules caused a strain in
their  relationship.  They  did  not  legally  separate  or  divorce,  but  they  had  a  physical
separation of unknown length. They eventually reconciled their differences and remained
together.  (Ans.)  Applicant  was  hired  as  a  defense  contractor  in  November  2017,  and
worked  in  one  state  while  maintaining  his  family  in  another  state.  In  2018,  his
unanticipated  expenses  for  the final family  move  to  a  third  state  totaled  approximately
$8,000. (AE A)
