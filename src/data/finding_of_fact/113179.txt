Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR with explanations. After a thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.

He has only recently been employed by a defense contractor. (GX 1 at page 13, and TR
at page 6 lines 4~9.) He served in the U.S. Navy “from 2003 through 2011.” (TR at page
13  lines  12~14.).  He  is  married,  and  has  two  children.  (TR  at  page  17  lines  7~9.)  He
attributes his current financial difficulties to a failed business. (TR at page 13 line 17 to
page 15 line 13.)
