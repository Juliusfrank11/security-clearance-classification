After  a  thorough  review  of  the  case  file,  I  make  the  following  findings  of  fact.
Applicant is 62 years old. Applicant received a bachelor’s degree in May 2000, and took
additional college courses from January 2003 until November 2005. He did not receive
an additional degree. He married the first time in 1980, had one child, and divorced in
1985. He married again in 1985 and had four children. Applicant and his wife separated
briefly  a  number  of times  in their marriage  and now  have  been separated  since  2015.
Applicant  and  his  wife  are  trying  to  reconcile.  He  has  four  adult  children  from  this
marriage.  Since  separating  from  his  wife,  Applicant  rented  the  basement  of  a  town
house where he and his special needs son reside. (Tr. 25-26, 35-38)
Applicant served on active duty in the Army from March 1975 until April 1995. He
retired as a First Sergeant (E-8) with an honorable discharge. After leaving active duty,
he served as a minister for three years until approximately 2000. In February 2002, he
started  working  with  his  present  defense  contractor  employer  as  a  mechanic.  He  was
continually  promoted  and  has  been  a  production  supervisor  for  the  last  ten  years.
Applicant’s  employer  has  been  very  supportive  of  him  while  he  undergoes  substance
abuse rehabilitation, to care for his son, and the need to care for and bury his mother.
(Tr.  26-27;  33-36;  GX  1,  e-QIP,  dated  June  18,  2016;  GX  3,  e-QIP,  dated  March  29,
2012)
The SOR alleges four financial security concerns under Guideline F; a Chapter 7
bankruptcy filed in November 2016 with debts discharged in March 2017 (SOR 1.a); a
Chapter  13  bankruptcy  filed  in  July  2016  but  dismissed  in  December  2016  (SOR  1.b);
federal income tax debt of approximately $45,773 for tax years 2009, and 2011 to 2015
(SOR 1.c); and a failure to file in a timely fashion federal tax returns for tax years 2009
through  2015  (SOR  1.d).  Delinquent  student  loans  are  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  as
financial  security  concerns  but  are  noted  on  credit  reports  (GX  4,  dated  May  9,  2017;
GX 5, dated August 19, 2016; GX 6, dated September 2, 2014; and GX 7, dated April 3,
2012).
The  SOR  alleges  under  alcohol  consumption  (Guideline  G)  that  Applicant  in
October 2011 discharged a firearm from a moving vehicle after consuming alcohol. He
was  sentenced  to  be  incarcerated  for  180  days  with  165  days  suspended.  (SOR  2.a).
The  SOR  also  alleges  that  after  consuming  alcohol  Applicant  was  arrested  for
recklessly  handling  a  firearm,  swearing  in  public  and  public  intoxication.  He  was
sentenced  to  probation  for  12  months.  (SOR  2.b)  These  offenses  were  also  cross-
alleged  as  criminal  conduct.  (SOR  3.a)  Applicant  admitted  all  allegations.  (Answer  to
SOR, dated October 25, 2018)
Applicant lived beyond his means while on active duty. He used credit cards sent
to  him  in  the  mail  to  bolster  his  ability  to  purchase  whatever  he  wanted.  After  leaving
active  duty  in  1995  and  working  as  a  minister,  Applicant  continued  to  have  financial
problems  caused  by  lack  of  sufficient  income  and  living  beyond  his  means.  In  1997,
Applicant and his second wife filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in an attempt to save their
house. They were unable to make the required payments to the bankruptcy trustee, so
the bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Their debts at the time were
discharged in the bankruptcy in 1997. His house was foreclosed in 2002. (Tr. 20-21, 35-
37;  GX  8  and  9,  Bankruptcy  Documents, 1997;  GX  10,  Foreclosure  documents,  dated
May 3, 2002; GX 11, Applicant’s Statement, dated May 16, 2002)
Applicant  and  his  wife  continued  to  have  financial  issues.  They  moved  so  he
could  have  a  better  job,  but  his  wife  could  not  find  employment  to  provide  sufficient
income for the family. He could not afford to buy a house so he rented one. Applicant’s
wife  usually  calculated,  completed,  and  filed  their  tax  returns.  After  a  separation  in
approximately 2006 from his wife, Applicant did not file his federal income tax returns for
six  years  from  approximately  2009  until  2015  because  he  knew  he  would  owe  about
$6,000  each  year  in  taxes  that  he  could  not  afford  to  pay.  His  wife  continued  to  file
separately. Starting in 2008, Applicant knew he would owe substantial federal taxes. He
was overwhelmed by his problems and did not focus on what he needed to do and did
not take care of his business. (Tr. 40-41, 73-75)
In 2012, Applicant went to a tax service and an attorney to resolve his taxes to no
avail. Starting in 2012, Applicant’s pay was garnished by the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS).  After  the  IRS  pay  garnishment,  Applicant’s  take-home  pay  was  reduced  to
approximately  $600  a month  after  garnishment.  Applicant’s  car  was  repossessed,  and
he  and  his  family  were  evicted  from  the  home  they  rented.  Applicant  and  his  wife
separated permanently in 2015. In 2016, Applicant was able to have a tax preparer file
his  past-due  tax  returns.  Applicant  has  continued  to  use  this  attorney  to  file  his  taxes.
(Tr. 41-43)
Applicant  also  contacted  an  attorney,  and  Applicant  and  his  wife  filed  another
Chapter 13 bankruptcy that was later converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Their debts
were again discharged in 2017. (Tr. 21-23, 43-45; GX 2, Bankruptcy Documents)
Applicant was overwhelmed by his financial issues and the need to care for his
special  needs  son.  After  the  bankruptcy  discharge,  Applicant  worked  with  a  Certified
Public  Accountant  (CPA)  to  resolve  the  federal  tax  debt  that  remained  from  the
bankruptcy  discharge.  With  the  help  of  the  CPA,  Applicant  was  able  to  have  his
disabled  son  declared  his  dependent  and  his  income  restructured  to  minimize  his  tax
liability. Instead of owing taxes, he received a tax refund that is applied to his tax debt.
His mother, who was located in another state, became sick and Applicant had to travel
to help care for her. His mother passed away in September 2018. (Tr. 23-25, 35-38)
Applicant filed his past-due federal tax returns in 2016. (AX F, G, and H, IRS Tax
Documents). He timely filed his 2016 and 2017 federal tax returns. (AX I and J, IRS Tax
Documents)  After  all  of  the  tax  returns  were  filed,  the  IRS  determined  that  Applicant
owed  approximately  $35,000  in  back  taxes.  In  April  2018,  Applicant  agreed  to  a
payment plan of $425 a month with the ISR to pay back taxes. His payment amount will
increase in April 2019 to $595. No taxes were owed for tax years 2016 and 2017. He is
current  with  the  IRS  payment  plan  for  past-due  taxes  for  tax  years  2010  to  2015.  (Tr.
49-52, 72-74)
Applicant  drank  alcohol  from  approximately  1990  to  2000.  He  started  drinking
because he was a young soldier and just wanted to drink alcohol. He stopped drinking
alcohol in 2000 because he entered the ministry becoming a pastor and did not want to
be  seen  consuming  alcohol.  He  started  drinking  again  in  2003  because  he  left  the
ministry  and  there  was  no  accountability  for  behavior,  he  was  still  having  financial
problems,  and  he  had  lost  his  home.  In  2010,  his  consumption  of  alcohol  increased
substantially  for  no  reason  except  he  and  his  wife  were  separated;  his  children  had
moved back into his house; and he had issues caring for his mother who was in another
state.  He  was  consuming  from  six  to  nine  beers  a  day.  He  drank  to  deal  with  his
problems  and  his  stress.  Applicant  sought  substance  abuse  counseling.  In  2015,  he
started to consult with a psychologist who he still periodically sees.  He  last  consumed
alcohol on September 22, 2018, the day before his mother’s funeral. The day before the
hearing,  he  started  a  Veteran’s  Affairs  (VA)  Substance  Abuse  Rehabilitation  Program
(SARP) through his employer. He understands he has an issue with alcohol and needs
treatment. He stated that he does not intend to consume alcohol in the future. (Tr. 51-
58, 75-78: AX A through D; VA Hospital staff assignments and schedule)
In  October  2011,  Applicant  was  separated  from  his  wife  and  dating  another
woman. He was consuming a few beers before the woman asked him to take her and
her young daughter to run some errands. Since he had been drinking alcohol, he asked
the  woman  to  drive.  Applicant  brought  a  handgun  with  him  because  the  jurisdiction
where  they  were  located  allowed  the  open  carrying  of  handguns.  Applicant  and  the
woman  argued  and  Applicant  became  irritated.  As  they  drove  down  a  road,  Applicant
fired his gun out the window of the moving car. He apologized to the woman and gave
her  his  gun.  But  she  drove  to  a  store  to  call  the  police.  Applicant  did  not  consider
himself  intoxicated  but  he  knew  he  was  over  the  legal  limit  to  drive.  Applicant  was
convicted of two counts of brandishing a weapon, served seven days in jail, and placed
on  probation for  six  months.  He  completed  the  period  of  probation.  He  was  monitored
for  substance  abuse  while  on  probation.  All  tests  were  negative.  (Tr.  59-65,  79-8;  GX
12,  Police  Report;  GX  13,  Court  Record;  GX  16,  Incident  Report;  GX  17,  Criminal
History Report)
Applicant had another incident with a weapon in 2015. By September 2015, his
mother, who had been living with him, moved back to her home because Applicant was
unable to care for her. Applicant also had problems with his special needs son, and the
IRS  was  questioning  him  about  his  failure  to  file  tax  returns.  Applicant  was  angry  and
frustrated. He went outside and fired his gun into the air three times. On the day of the
incident, Applicant consumed over a pint of alcohol. He was arrested and charged with
reckless handling of a firearm and public intoxication. He was convicted and sentenced
to twelve months of supervised probation. He wore an ankle bracelet from October 2015
until October 2016. He did not consume alcohol and successfully completed probation.
He  no  longer  owes  a  firearm.  However,  he  has  continued  to  consume  moderate
amounts  of alcohol  since ending  his probation  in  October  2016.  (Tr. 65-70, 80-81; GX
14,  Police  Report;  GX  15,  Court  Record;  GX  16,  Incident  Report;  GX  17,  Criminal
History Report)
Applicant presented a letter from a friend who is a psychologist and has known
Applicant for over 25 years. The friend provided mentoring and counseling for Applicant.
Applicant  has  been  candid  and  transparent  about  the  issues  he  has  encountered
including  the  death  of  his  mother.  He  believes  Applicant  has  taken  the  counseling  he
received  to  heart  and  is  developing  positive  coping  methods.  He  is  resolving  his
financial  issue  and making  restitution. He  is  taking  strides to  correct  his past mistakes
and entered substance abuse treatment. He is making efforts to reconcile with his wife.
The friend recommends that he be granted eligibility for access to classified information.
