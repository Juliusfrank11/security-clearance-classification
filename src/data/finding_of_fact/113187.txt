Applicant  is  a  54-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  retain  a  security
clearance.  He  is  employed  as  a  fabricator  for  a  company  in  the  defense  industry.  He
has been so employed since 2002. He serves as the lead of a fabrication shop located
on  a  U.S.  military  installation.  His  educational  background  includes  a  high  school
diploma  and  about  two  years  of  college.  He  has  married  and  divorced  twice,  with  the
last  divorce  in  2005.  He  has  two  adult  children  from  his  marriages.  His  employment
history  include  military  service  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  1981  to  1995.  (Tr.  42-47)  His
service  included  a  year-long  deployment  for  Operations  Desert  Shield  and  Storm,  as
known as the Persian Gulf War or the First Gulf War.
The SOR  concerns  a history  of financial problems  consisting  of failure  to  timely
file  state  and  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2002  through  2013.  Applicant
does not dispute or contest the allegations. He disclosed that he failed to file state and
federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  year  2005,  as  a  result  of  his  second  divorce,  in  his
March 2014 security clearance application. (Exhibit 1) He attributed his tax problems to
falling  behind  on  his  tax  obligations,  embarrassment,  and  inaction.  (Tr.  30,  47-48)  He
described his situation as follows:
What  happened  at  the  time  was  I’d  gotten  behind  in  my  taxes  and  owed
almost $2,000, which I could not afford and simply got behind in my taxes
and then felt embarrassed to bring it current. And each year, not having a
previous tax return, I just hoped it would not surface or anything. (Tr. 30)
He decided to take action to address his problematic tax situation after completing his
March 2014 security clearance application. (Tr. 31-32)
Applicant is now in compliance with both federal and state tax authorities. Due to
age, he was unable to file returns before tax year 2009, but he provided documentary
proof of filing state and federal tax returns for tax years 2009 through 2017. (Exhibits A-
Y).  He  explained  that he filed  the  returns  periodically  due  to  the  cost  involved  using  a
tax preparer and availability of funds. (Tr. 34-35; Exhibit A) Going forward, his plan is to
stay current with his tax obligations and never get into a similar situation. (Tr. 36)
Concerning the federal income tax returns, Applicant filed returns as follows: (1)
2009  past  due  in  April  2014;  (2)  2010  past  due  in  April  2014;  (3)  2011  past  due  in
January  2015;  (4)  2012  past  due  in  March  2015;  (5)  2013  past  due  in  April  2016;  (6)
2014  timely  in  March  2015;  (7)  2015  timely  in  April  2016;  (8)  2016  past  due  in  July
2018; and (9) 2017 filed past due in July 2018. (Exhibits G-O) IRS account transcripts
for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017 show account balances of $0 for those three years.
(Exhibits C-F)
Concerning  the  state  income  tax  returns,  Applicant  filed  returns  as  follows:  (1)
2009 past due in April 2014; (2) 2011 past due in January 2015; (3) 2012 past due in
March 2015; (4) 2013 past due in April 2016; (5) 2014 timely in March 2015; (6) 2015
timely in April 2016; (7) 2016 past due in July 2018; and (8) 2017 past due in July 2018.
(Exhibits P-X) He received a $512 refund from the state tax authority for tax year 2017.
(Exhibit  B;  Tr.  21)  The  state
issued  Applicant  a  certificate  of
tax  authority
compliance/letter of good standing on September 26, 2018. (Exhibit Y)
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
1  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S.  518,  528  (1988)  (“it  should  be  obvious  that  no  one  has  a
‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no
right to a security clearance).
2 484 U.S. at 531.
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.6
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;
AG ¶ 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local
income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income
tax as required; and
3 484 U.S. at 531.
4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).
5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).
6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶¶ E3.1.14 and E3.1.15.
AG ¶ 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax
authority  to  file  or  pay  the  amount  owed  and  is  in  compliance  with  those
arrangements.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.  The
disqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.
Applicant  made  good  progress  in  resolving  the  tax  matters,  and  he  is  now  in
compliance with both federal and state tax authorities. That means he has filed all tax
returns, as required, and he has paid all taxes due, as required. And he did a good job
documenting his compliance.
In addressing this issue, I note that an applicant’s failure to timely file tax returns
and pay tax when due bears close examination and is a matter of serious concern to the
federal government. The DOHA Appeal Board has made it clear that an applicant who
fails repeatedly to fulfill their legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying tax
when  due,  does  not  demonstrate  the  high  degree  of  good  judgment  and  reliability
required  of  those  granted  access  to  classified  information.  See  ISCR  Case  No.  15-
06707 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2017).
Here,  I  am  concerned  about  the  duration  of  Applicant’s  tax  problems  and  the
timing of his remedial action. Applicant failed to timely file state and federal income tax
returns for more than a decade. He has been in compliance for a relatively brief period
of time compared with the time of his noncompliance. It is also noted that both his state
and federal returns for the  last  two  tax  years,  2017  and  2018,  were filed  past  the  due
date. Considering the totality of facts and circumstances, it is far too soon to tell if he will
continue  to  meet  his  tax  obligations  on  a  timely  basis.  Accordingly,  the  mitigating
condition  at  AG  ¶  20(g)  applies,  but  the  evidence  is  not  sufficient  to  justify  complete
mitigation of his long-standing irresponsibility in failing to meet his legal obligations.
Following Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to  protect
classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence
as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he
has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with
the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a -- 1.b:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for
access to classified information. Eligibility denied.
