Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  2014.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  military  from  1983  until  he
retired  with  an  honorable  discharge  in  2003.  He  seeks  to  retain  a  security  clearance,
which he has held since he was in the military. He has a bachelor’s degree, awarded in
2009, and a master’s degree, awarded in 2011. He is married with three adult children
and three adult stepchildren.1
Applicant has a history of driving and alcohol-related incidents, and problems in
the  workplace.  The  alcohol  and  driving  incidents  will  be  addressed  first.  He  was
arrested twice in about 1978 to 1979 for driving under the influence (DUI). He was about
18 or 19 years old at the time. When he was interviewed for a background investigation
in 1987, he stated that he was fined more than $100 for one of the DUIs, but he did not
recall the amount of the other fine. At his hearing, he initially testified that he could not
remember being arrested for DUI during that time period. He eventually conceded that
he  had  been  arrested  as  alleged,  but  he  later  again  stated  that  he  could  not  recall
whether  the  incidents  occurred.  Applicant’s  testimony  and  statements  about  this  and
other incidents were evasive, inconsistent, and not credible.2
Applicant  was  arrested  in  May  1988  and  charged  with  drunk  driving  and
speeding  by  going  49  miles  per  hour  (MPH)  in  a  35  MPH  zone.  He  pleaded  guilty  to
reckless driving, and the speeding offense was dismissed. He paid a $200 fine, and his
license was suspended for 30 days.3
Applicant  wrote  in  his  response  to  the  SOR  that  he  “stopped  at  a  local  bar that
served alcohol, and [he] recall[ed] drinking  one beer.” He stated that the drunk driving
charge  was  reduced  and  “would  have  been  dismissed  if  it  weren’t  for  the  speed.”  He
admitted  at  his  hearing  that  he  may  have  had  two  or  more  beers.  The  military  police
report of the incident indicates that Applicant failed the field sobriety test and his blood
alcohol content (BAC) was measured at 12% and 13%. He testified that the BAC may
have been affected by his dentures.4

Applicant was charged with public swearing/intoxication in July 2007. He paid a
$71 fine, and the charge was subsequently dismissed. Applicant stated that the police
were called after an argument with his wife.5
Applicant  was  arrested  in  June  2013  and  charged  with  driving  while  intoxicated
(DWI), first offense. He pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of reckless driving. He was
sentenced  to  60  days  in  jail,  with  all  time  suspended;  probation  for  12  months;  a
restricted driver’s license; and a $500 fine.6
Applicant stated that he had no more than three beers at a baseball game, and
he did not  think his driving  would be impaired. He admitted that his BAC  was .09% to
.10%.  When  he  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  March  2014,  he
stated that the 2013 arrest was an isolated incident and not part of a pattern of alcohol-
related issues. He denied ever being charged with any other alcohol-related offenses.7
He wrote in his response to the SOR:
During my court appearance the prosecution agreed to reduce the charge
to reckless driving because this was my first and only offense in my entire
driving  history  at  the  time  which  was  considered  as  mitigating  evidence.
Therefore, I was officially charged with a lesser charge of reckless driving.
I  plead[ed]  guilty  and  paid  the  applicable  fine.  I  emphasize  that  this  was
my first offense, at that time, in my entire driving history.
Applicant testified that he did not intend to be dishonest, and that he said he had
only  one  alcohol-related  driving  offense  because  he  thought  the  investigation  was
limited  to  the  previous  seven  years.  He  also  stated  that  he  thought  that  because  the
charges had been reduced to reckless driving, they did not count.8
Applicant was charged in 2014 with the misdemeanor offense of reckless driving:
improper brakes. He was found guilty of the lesser offense of improper control/driving.
Applicant stated that he was reaching for a pair of sunglasses when a car cut in front of
him and abruptly stopped. He hit the back of the car. Alcohol was not involved.9
Applicant  attended  and  completed  alcohol  counseling  as  a  requirement  of  his
probation for the 2013 offense. He stated that he has learned from the experience, he
does not drink to excess, there have been no additional driving offenses, and there will
be no additional alcohol-related incidents.10

Applicant  was  terminated  from  a  job  in  2007  after  his  employer  discovered
multiple pornographic files on his network drive. Applicant stated that he was leaving the
company,  and  he  brought  in  a  compact  disc  (CD)  from  home  to  copy  some  personal
files from his work computer. He mistakenly picked up a CD that had pornography on it.
He stated that he did not intentionally place the files on the network drive, and that they
were accidentally uploaded to the drive while he was copying other files. He stated that
he was terminated the next day, “on the same day that [he] had planned to resign.”11
Applicant  provided  a  similar,  but  slightly  different,  account  of  the  termination
during  a  January  2009  background  interview.  He  stated  that  he  accidently  copied  the
pornographic material onto his work computer from a memory stick. He was fired about
two weeks later, and he did not mention that he had already planned to resign.12
Applicant  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  from  about  March  2013  until  his
contact  was  terminated  as  the  result  of  a  layoff  in  October  2013.  In  April  2013,  he
violated  policy  when  he  downloaded  a  file  from  his  personal  e-mail  account,  which
contained  multiple  usernames  and  passwords  for  DOD  accounts  and  other  personal
account information. He received a written reprimand in which he was directed to take
additional training, with a warning that if his “future activities result in additional security
incidents,  disciplinary  action,  such  as  a  formal  performance  action  plan  or  involuntary
separation,  may  follow.”  Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  an  Excel  spreadsheet  with
“nonworking”  old  passwords  that  he  used  to  keep  track  of  old  passwords,  so  that  he
would not use them again.13
In  about  September  2013,  Applicant  plugged  his  personal  phone  into  his  work
computer  to  charge  the  phone.  He  immediately  removed  it  when  he  was  told  that  he
had violated security rules.14
Applicant was at a work meeting in about October 2013 when he commented to
the person next to him to the effect that if he brought his firearm, he could take out the
entire  leadership  or  a  bomb  could  do  the  same.  Applicant  denied  making  a  threat.  He
meant the comment to be a precaution about the lack of security in the facility.15
Applicant  is  highly  regarded,  as  reported  by  two  witnesses  and  various
documents. He is praised for his excellent job performance, work ethic, trustworthiness,
professionalism, and integrity.16
