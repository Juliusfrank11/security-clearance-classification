Under Guideline G, the SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested in 2014 for driving
while  intoxicated  (DWI),  pled  guilty  and  was  convicted  in  January  2016.  His  sentence
included  15  months’  probation.  He  participated  in  treatment  from  December  2017  to
January  2018  following  a  diagnosis  of  alcohol  use  disorder.  Applicant  was  arrested  in
March 2018 and charged with DWI, second offense. He pled guilty and was convicted in
January 2019. His sentence included 180 days confinement, suspended, and 15 months’
probation. He was evaluated in March 2019 and diagnosed with moderate alcohol use
disorder in early partial remission. Applicant was advised to abstain from all mood altering
chemicals, including alcohol. Applicant admits each of these allegations. Applicant stated
in his answer that he also participated in treatment from April 2018 until June 2018. The
two DWI arrests are cross alleged under Guideline J. Applicant admits the Guideline J
allegation.
Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant intentionally falsified material
facts  on  his  2012  and  2014  e-QIPs  by  failing  to  disclose  that  he  had   illegally  used
marijuana from May 2004  until  2012. Applicant  admits  the two allegations under Guideline
E.  Applicant’s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant, 35, is a trade compliance specialist employed by a defense contractor
since August 2016. He worked for another defense contractor from April 2013 until August
2016. He received his associate’s degree in 2007 and his bachelor’s degree in 2012. He
married  in  2015  and  he  and  his  wife  have  two  children.  He  was  previously  granted  a
security clearance in February 2014. (GX 3; GX 4.)
In  response  to  DOHA’s  June  2020  interrogatories,  which  stated  that  records
obtained in Applicant’s background investigation revealed past illegal-drug use and asked
Applicant to describe his marijuana use, Applicant disclosed that he first used marijuana
in May 2004 and last used it in 2012 with a frequency of less than once a month. He did
not disclose this use on his 2012 and 2014 e-QIPs as required. (GX 4; GX 3.) The record
does not contain any explanation by Applicant regarding his falsifications.
In May 2014, while holding a security clearance, Applicant consumed eight or nine
beers over approximately three hours with his then girlfriend now wife at her home. They
got into an argument and Applicant left with the intention of dropping to his parents’ house.
He  was  pulled  over  for  speeding  and  ultimately  arrested  for  DWI  with  a  blood  alcohol
content of .13. In approximately January 2016 he pled guilty to DWI and was sentenced
to  15  months  of  supervised  probation,  70  hours  of  community  service,  a  fine  of
approximately $1,000, and required to pay the state DWI surcharge of $800 a year for
three years. He was also required to attend alcohol awareness classes. He underwent a
court-ordered alcohol abuse evaluation and the evaluator did not recommend treatment.
In December 2017, Applicant voluntarily entered an alcohol treatment program where he
was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. He participated in the program for 30 days. (GX
4.)
In March 2018, Applicant was drinking beer at home, argued with his wife, and got
in his car and drove away. He was pulled over for speeding and ultimately arrested for
DWI with a blood alcohol content of .08. In January 2019, he pled guilty to DWI and was
sentenced  to  180  days  in  jail,  suspended,  15  months’  supervised  probation  which
included random alcohol and drug screening, 60 hours of community service, court costs
and fines of $850, and the state DWI surcharge of $800 for three years. (GX 4.) He was
still on probation when he underwent his 2019 background investigation.
In  April  2018,  Applicant  again  voluntarily  entered  an  alcohol  abuse  treatment
program at the same facility. He successfully completed a 60-day program in June 2018
and Applicant asserts that has maintained sobriety since completing the program and that
he regularly attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. (GX 4; GX 3.) However, he did not
submit any substantiating evidence of his continued abstinence.
Applicant  again  underwent  a  court-ordered  alcohol-abuse  evaluation  in  March
2019 and was diagnosed with moderate alcohol use disorder in early partial remission.
The evaluator made the following recommendations: that Applicant remain abstinent from
all  mood  altering  chemicals  to  include  alcohol;  that  Applicant  undergo  random  drug
screening; and that Applicant participate in a 30-hour DWI intervention course for repeat
DWI offenders. The evaluator did not recommend treatment unless evidence indicated
that Applicant was using alcohol or illegal drugs or abusing prescription medication,  in
which case he should be required to participate in intensive outpatient treatment. (GX 4.)
