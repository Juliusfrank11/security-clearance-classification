In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comment, all of the SOR
allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.d.). Applicant’s
admissions  are  incorporated  herein.  After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings
of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 30-year-old independent subcontractor of a defense contractor. He
has  been  serving  in  logistics  with  his  current  sponsor  since  September  2019.  He
previously  served  in a  variety  of full-time  or  part-time positions  with  the  Army  National
Guard (ANG) as an inactive reservist, a temporary technician, and a dual status federal
technician.  His  most  recent  grade  was  that  of  sergeant  (E-5).  A  2009  high  school
graduate, he continued his education, earning credits, but to date, he has not received a
degree. It is unclear if he was ever granted a security clearance, for in his SF 86 he denied
ever receiving one, but Department Counsel asserted, without documentary verification,
that  he  had  been  granted  a  clearance  in  2008.  He  was  married  in  2017.  He  has  two
children, born in 2018 and 2020.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can be found in the following exhibits: Item 3 (SF 86, dated October 27, 2017); Item 5
(Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated November 20, 2019);
and Item 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated December 22, 2020.
Applicant  reported  that  he  was  unemployed  from  November  2013  until  January
2014, but that was not the focus of his financial difficulties. He noted that during the period
2017 until 2019, several factors contributed to his financial problems: his wife stopped
working  upon  becoming  pregnant;  she  subsequently  remained  home  to  care  for  their
child;  and  his  financial  situation  became  very  inconsistent  when  he  was  with  the  ANG
when there were periods of insufficient funding to keep him in a settled or paid routine. A
number  of  accounts  became  delinquent  due  to  his  inability  to  keep  them  in  a  current
status. Applicant referred to unspecified district court activities associated with several of
the accounts, but it remains unclear if any of those actions resulted in judgments against
him. As a result of his increasing financial burden, he purportedly sought the assistance
of  a  debt-resolution  company.  It  remains  unclear  what  services,  if  any,  that  company
performed for him for Applicant failed to submit any documentation to support his claim.
In  February  2021,  he  also  obtained  a  debt-consolidation  loan,  in  the  amount  of
$20,000, to enable him to address his debts. (AE A (Experian Credit Report, dated March
12, 2021, at 5)) However, as noted by Department Counsel, it is unclear if Applicant has
yet  made  any  monthly  payments  on  the  loan  as,  once  again,  he  failed  to  submit  any
documentation other than a monthly budget to indicate that payments are being made.
The SOR alleged four delinquent accounts totaling approximately $24,785, as set
forth as follows:
SOR  ¶  1.a.  is  a  credit-card  account  with  an  unpaid  balance  of  $2,523  that  was
charged off in March 2019, after being 120 days past due. (Item 5, at 8; Item 4, at 2; Item
3, at 52-53; Extract of Equifax Credit Report, attached to Response to the FORM) In his
Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  the  allegation  without  comment,  but  in  his
Response to the FORM, he claimed he paid off the creditor in February 2021 and resolved
the account. He subsequently submitted a recent credit report that reported the account
status as “paid, was a charge-off.” (AE A, at 11) The account has been resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.b.  is  a  credit-card  account  with  an  unpaid  balance  of  $4,491  that  was
charged off in April 2019, after being 120 days past due. (Item 5, at 8; Item 4, at 3; Item
3, at 54-55; Extract of Equifax Credit Report, attached to Response to the FORM) In his
Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  the  allegation  without  comment,  but  in  his
Response  to  the  FORM,  he  claimed  that  his  efforts  to  address  the  account  with  the
collection agent were rebuffed because it was no longer the holder of the account, and
they are pending an assignment to a “recoupment company.” While the account remains
unresolved, Applicant is credited with attempting to resolve it.
SOR  ¶  1.c.  is  a  credit-card  account  with  an  unpaid  balance  of  $4,522  that  was
charged off in August 2018, after being 120 days past due. (Item 5, at 8; Item 4, at 3; Item
3, at 53-54; Extract of Equifax Credit Report, attached to Response to the FORM) In his
Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  the  allegation  without  comment,  but  in  his
Response to the FORM, he claimed he paid off the creditor in February 2021 and resolved
the account. He subsequently submitted a recent credit report that reported the account
status as “paid, was a charge-off.” (AE A, at 15) The account has been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.d. is an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance of $13,249
that was charged off in December 2017, after being 120 days past due. (Item 5, at 9; Item
4,  at  3;  Extract  of  Equifax  Credit  Report,  attached  to  Response  to  the  FORM)  In  his
Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  the  allegation  without  comment,  but  in  his
Response to the FORM, he claimed he paid off the creditor in February 2021 and resolved
the account. He subsequently submitted a recent credit report that reported the account
status as “paid, was a charge-off.” (AE A, at 18) The account has been resolved.
It  is  noted  that  despite  Applicant’s  claimed  inability  to  maintain  the  accounts
alleged in the SOR in a current status because of insufficient funds to do so, he managed
to take three personal trips to visit his wife’s family in Poland in 2017, 2018, and 2019 for
varying periods between 6-20 days. (Item 3, at 42-45).
Applicant’s Personal Monthly Budget reports $4,400 in current net monthly income;
$3,513  in  monthly  expenses,  including  $829  for  the  consolidation  loan;  and  a  monthly
remainder  of  $887  that  might  be  available  for  discretionary  spending  or  savings.
(Response  to  the  FORM)  There  is  no  evidence  of  financial  counseling.  Based  on  his
current monthly budget, Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had
been.
