Applicant,  49,  is  an  IT  manager  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since
September 2016. He received his bachelor’s degree in 1983 and his master’s degree in
2003.  He  and  his  wife  married  in  1996  and  have  two  adult  children.  This  is  his  first
application for a security clearance. (GX 2.)
Under Guideline F, SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant owes a delinquent credit-card
debt of $21,322. Applicant was confronted with the account during his June 2018 personal
subject interview (PSI). According to the PSI, the account was in collection as of January
2017 with a balance of $24,022. Applicant disputed the debt as not being his, asserting
that he had no delinquent credit cards and did not have an account with this creditor. He
denied any knowledge of the account. (GX 3.) While Applicant admits the SOR allegation
in his Answer, he states that he believes the account has been resolved because it no
longer appears on his credit-monitoring site and the site does not show any collections
accounts. The debt is reflected on his May 2019 credit bureau report (CBR) but does not
appear on his December 2020 CBR. (GX 4; GX 5.)
In addition to the $21,322 credit-card account alleged  in  SOR ¶  1.a, Applicant’s
2019 CBR listed four open credit-card accounts, all of which were current at the time. The
credit cards had credit limits of $4,500, $3,500, $2,400, and $124. The credit limit on the
account that Applicant disputes above was $25,950. Applicant’s 2020 CBR shows only
the four current credit-card accounts.
Applicant’s  December  2020  CBR  shows  that  he  was  30-days  past  due  on  his
mortgage-loan  payment  and  that  he  has  periodically  been  30-days  past  due  with  his
mortgage-loan payment dating back to October 2018. However, the CBR also shows that
Applicant has never been more than 30 days late on any payments. During his PSI, the
investigator  confronted  Applicant  with  being  30-days  late  on  his  December  2016
mortgage-loan payment. Applicant explained that his wife pays the bills through standard
mail and that the mortgage payment may have been inadvertently late as a result of this
practice. (GX 5; GX 3.)
On his October 2016 e-QIP, Applicant listed that he had a $320 medical bill turned
over  to  collection  in  January  2016.  Applicant  explained  in  his  PSI  that  payment  of  the
medical  bill  was  denied  by  his  insurance,  he  unsuccessfully  disputed  the  denial,  and
ultimately paid the account prior to completing his e-QIP. (GX 2; GX 3.)
According to a major credit-reporting agency:
Collections can be removed from credit reports in only two ways:
If the collection information is valid, you must wait seven  years from
1.
the  original  delinquency  date  for  the  information   to  cycle  off   your  credit
reports.  The  original  delinquency date is the  date the account first became
delinquent and after which it was never again brought current.
2.
If  collection information is inaccurate,  you  can file  a dispute on the
collection  information  in   your  credit  report.   Depending  on  what  the
inaccuracy is, the collection account may be updated rather than removed.
Applicant’s CBRs show a credit history dating back to 1998 that includes paid-off
credit cards and vehicle loans. With the exception of the single SOR debt and the periodic
late mortgage-loan payments, Applicant CBRs show no history of financial delinquencies.
He  lives  within  his  means  and  is  current  on  all  his  other  open  accounts  including  his
student loans and second mortgage loan. (GX 4; GX 5.)
