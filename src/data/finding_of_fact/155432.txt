In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  all  allegations  with  explanations.
(Item  2)  She  is  58  years-old  and  unmarried  with  no  children.  Applicant  attended
college, and she obtained her undergraduate degree in 1984. She received a graduate
degree  in  March  2010.  She  has  also  attended  college  classes  from  2010  to  2015.
Applicant completed her most recent security clearance application on August 5, 2019.
She  retired  from  employment  in  2010  after  working  20  years  and  has  worked  for  her
current employer as a scheduler since July 2019. (Item 4) Applicant does not currently
hold a security clearance. (Item 3)
Financial
The SOR alleges that Applicant has filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection on
five  occasions  from  1989  to  2017,  and  has  a  delinquent  credit  card  account  placed  in
collection.  Applicant  admitted  all  SOR  allegations.  She  stated  in  her  Answer  that
unemployment  was  the  reason  for  two  bankruptcies  in  2010  and  2011.  However,  she
filed  for  bankruptcy  protection  twice  while  she  was  employed  full  time.  Her  November
2010,  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  claimed  $64,377  in  unsecured  non-priority  debts,  which
consisted  of  primarily  student  loans  and  other  unsecured  loans.  (1.c)  SOR  (1.b)  was
dismissed in 2011 due to unemployment and subsequent inability to make the payment
plans. (Item 2, 10) She elaborated that her decision to seek bankruptcy protection was
made  at  the  advice  of  her  attorney.  She  elaborated  that  in  2010  she  had  medical
problems  and  was  granted  a  medical  release  from  her  job  of  almost  20  years.  Her
income  changed  significantly  and  has  never  been  the  same.  She  acknowledged  that
she  takes  the  responsibility  for  not  downsizing  and  changing  her  living  habits  as  she
should.
As  to  SOR  ¶   1.a,  an  active  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  filed  in   June  2017,  she
claimed  $168,802 in  student loans and  $9,927  in  other non-priority debts. Her plan was
confirmed   in   2017,   amended   in  February 2018,  and   modified   twice in   November  2018
based  on  the  trustee’s  assertion  that  Applicant  is  party  to  a  lawsuit  or  other   course  of
action  that  might  result  in   additional  disposable  income.   In  January  2020,  the  trustee
moved  to  dismiss  the  bankruptcy  following   Applicant’s  failure  to   make  plan  payments;
and  an income withholding order was issued to withhold plan payments from  Applicant’s
wages. Applicant submitted a copy of the Trustee’s report  of receipts and  disbursement
for  this case. It  does not appear  that there is  a  delinquency of $5,203.10.  (Item  9)  She
has  shown   that  payments  were  made  until  December  9,  2020.  (Response  to  FORM)
The motion to dismiss was withdrawn on May 4, 2020. (Item  9)
Applicant also noted that in reference to SOR 1.b and 1.c, as discussed above,
she filed and refiled within one week in 2010, because she wanted to include a vehicle
and to demonstrate that she was employed. (Item 11) The bankruptcy was dismissed in
2011. The 2011 Chapter 13 bankruptcy reported essentially the same debts associated
with  the  2010  filing.  This  was  dismissed  as  discussed  above  for  failure  to  make  plan
payments.
As  to  SOR  1.d,  Applicant  filed  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  relief  in  September
2005, claiming $20,928 in unsecured non-priority debts such as cash advances, credit
card  debt,  consumer  service  accounts  and  unsecured  loans.  This  bankruptcy  was
discharged in October 2008. (Item 12)
Applicant  first  filed  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy,  SOR  1.e,  in  1989.  It  was
converted to Chapter 7 and discharged in August 1995. (Item 13)
As  to  SOR  1.f,  a  collection  account  that  was  her  mother’s,  Applicant  has
consistently  made  payments  on  the  account  and  submitted  documentation  to  support
her $50 monthly payments since 2015, with a current balance of $2,363, reduced from
the original balance of $3,013. (Attachment to Answer)
In  Applicant’s  subject  interviews  of  2019  and  2012,  Applicant  stated  that  she
really did not understand the bankruptcy process when she first filed and dismissed the
early ones. As to the last 2017 filing, she stated that she became unemployed in 2017
and  decided  to  file  for  bankruptcy.  She  pays  $379  a  month  to  the  bankruptcy  trustee.
Applicant has student loans that are not included in the bankruptcy plans, but she has
no  documentation  that  she  has  paid  them.  She  claims  they  are  in  deferment,  but
provided  no  information  concerning  the  issue.  The  student  loans  occurred  between
2008 and 2015. (Items 5, 8)
Applicant  also  blamed  gambling  habits  and  overextending  on  spending  for  her
2005 filing.  She admits  over  extension in debt,  spending  above her  means, and using
too many credit cards. (Item 7) She admitted the debts were not tied to circumstances
beyond her control. Also, she was 90 to 180 days delinquent on accounts before filing
for bankruptcy. She has never sought financial counseling.
In 2012, Applicant reported that her gambling habits led to some of her financial
difficulties  and  that  she  would  gamble  an  average  of  twice  every  three  months.  She
used  gambling  as  a  hobby  and  entertainment.  (Item  7)  She  did  not  believe  that  it
impacted many of her accounts. It is not clear from the record whether she still gambles.
Applicant  is  now  gainfully  employed.  There  is  no  information  in  the  record
concerning  her  salary,  use  of  a  financial  counselor,  (except  the  requisite  counseling
when  filing  a  bankruptcy),  or  budget.  There  are  no  character  references.  When
Applicant  was  gainfully  employed  before  her  retirement  in  2010,  she  received  two
bankruptcy  discharges:  a  Chapter  7  discharge  (converted  from  Chapter  13)  in  August
1995,  and  a  Chapter  13  discharge  in  2008.  (Items  3,  12,  13)  Two  months  after
retirement,  she  filed  a  third  bankruptcy,  which  was  dismissed  for  failure  to  make  plan
payments.  (Item  11)  This  bankruptcy  included  student  loans  that  appear  to  be
associated with her 2010 graduate degree. Additional student loans are also claimed in
the active bankruptcy. (Item 9)
