In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.f,
1.g, and 1.j. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.d, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.k-1.u. He stated,
“I  agree” to  the allegation in  SOR  ¶ 1.e, but his explanation amounted to a denial. He
admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b but denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.c.
He denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 3.a. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
General Background Information
Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is the field service
lead for a team providing IT support for the senior leadership on a military installation. (Tr.
56-57.) He attended a community college from June 2010 to August 2012 and obtained
an associate’s degree in computer science. He married in August 2010. He and his wife
lived apart for about three years while she was employed in another state. They are now
living together. They have no children.
Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from September 2005 to January
2008  and  was  honorably  discharged  for  medical  reasons.  He  testified  that  he  was
discharged because he has angioedema, a swelling of areas under the skin. His medical
records  also  reflect  chronic  lower  back  pain.  He  has  a  30%  disability  and  receives
disability pay of about $456 per month. (Tr. 80.)
Applicant   was  employed  by  federal  contractors  in   physical-security  jobs  from
January 2008 to March 2013.  He  was  unemployed  from March  2013  to February 2014.
He  was employed by another federal contractor from February 2014 to September 2014,
when he quit that  job  for a  better opportunity. He  was employed  in  the private sector from
September  2014  to  August  2016.  He   worked  for   a   federal  contractor  in   August  and
September 2016. (GX  1 at  10-16.)  He  was unemployed from September 2016 to January
2017. (GX 2 at 7.) He  has worked  for his current employer since February  2017.  His SCA
reflects that he has never held a security  clearance. (GX 1 at 32.) However, in  his answer
to the SOR, he refers  to a reinvestigation of his clearance in  2017-2018, indicating that
he has previously held a clearance.
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges that Applicant has 21 delinquent debts totaling about $61,348.
The evidence concerning these allegations is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: judgment obtained  by  a credit union in March 2015 for $24,582.
Applicant obtained  a debt-consolidation loan from  his credit union,  while  he was on active
duty.  (GX  10 at 1; GX 12 at  10.) He  made payments on this loan until  he was laid  off  in
March  2013.  (Answer  at  1.)   In  March  2015,  the  credit  union  obtained   a  judgment  for
$24,582. (GX 3.)  In January 2020,  the credit union initiated a garnishment of Applicant’s
pay   to  satisfy  the  judgment.  The   interest,   attorney’s  fees,  and   garnishment  costs
increased  the  amount  of  the  debt  to   $46,406,  and   a  hearing  on  the  garnishment  was
scheduled for  May 2020. (AX A-2.)  His pay has been garnished in  the amount of $263.66
per week since January 2020. (AX 2.)
SOR ¶ 1.b: judgment obtained by  a credit union in March 2015 for $13,029.  In
Applicant’s  answer to the SOR  and at the hearing, he stated that this debt was  included
in SOR ¶ 1.a.  (Answer at 1; Tr. 92.)  In March 2015, the credit union obtained a judgment
for  $13,029. The  judgment alleged in  SOR ¶ 1.a and  this judgment were initiated on the
same day and  the both judgments were entered on the same day, but they have  different
case numbers, indicating two separate debts. (GX 3;  GX  4.)  This  judgment is not satisfied.
SOR ¶ 1.c:  judgment  obtained by  an apartment  complex  in November 2018
for  $925.   In   his  answer  to   the  SOR,  Applicant  claimed   that  this   judgment  was   for  a
fraudulent debt opened in  his name.  Court records reflect that  a default judgment  was
entered against him. (GX  5.)  At  the hearing,  he testified that he  had  never heard of the
creditor who obtained the judgment. He has taken no action to resolve it. (Tr. 96-97.)
SOR ¶ 1.d: judgment obtained by  a furniture company  in February  2018  for
$992. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant  claimed that this judgment was for  a  fraudulent
debt  opened   in   his  name.  Court  records  reflect  that  a  default  judgment   was  entered
against him. (GX 6.)  He has taken no action to resolve it. (Tr. 97.)
SOR ¶ 1.e: judgment obtained  by  an apartment complex  in October 2017 for
$2,262.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed  that he  had a  payment  agreement
with  the  rental  company  after  being  laid   off,  but  new  owners  refused  to   honor  the
agreement  and   obtained   a  judgment   in   October  2017.  Court  records  reflect  that  the
judgment is not satisfied. (GX 7.)  Applicant  claimed  that the  amount owed was $1,100
and   the  rest   of  the  amount  of   the  judgment  was  for  legal  fees.  (Answer  at  1.)   At   the
hearing, he testified that he made payments of $100 per month for six to eight months,
but he could not recall why he stopped making payments. (Tr. 99-100.) He provided no
documentation of payments. The debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶  1.f: unpaid court costs and fines of $356. In Applicant’s answer to the
SOR, he admitted this debt and said he was using his tax refunds to pay it. (Answer at
1.) Court records reflect that the fines and costs were for failure to appear, resulting in his
being charged with contempt of court. (GX 8.) At the hearing, he testified that he believed
that he paid them, but he submitted no documentation of payment. (Tr. 100.)
SOR ¶ 1.g: unpaid court costs and fines of $466. In Applicant’s answer to the
SOR, he admitted this debt and said he was using his tax refunds to pay it. (Answer at
1.) The fines and costs were for an arrest for driving while intoxicated in April 2016 and a
conviction  in  September  2016.  (GX  9.)  The  arrest  and  conviction  are  alleged  under
Guideline G in SOR ¶ 2.a and reflected in court records in GX 13. SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g
allege Applicant’s failure to pay the fines and court costs for his  September 2016 DWI
conviction. He initially testified that he intended to pay them, but when he found that the
fines and court  costs were  being  taken from  his tax refunds,  he decided he  would “let
them take whatever they needed” and then worry about those that were not paid. (Tr. 64.)
Later in the hearing, he testified that he paid this debt in person at the courthouse, but he
submitted no documentation of payment. (Tr. 100.)
SOR ¶ 1.h  charged-off automobile loan for $7,102. In Applicant’s answer to the
SOR, he denied this debt and claimed that it was a fraudulent debt opened in his name.
(Answer at 1.) The credit reports reflect that the debt was for an automobile loan opened
in January 2015. (GX 10 at 2; GX 11 at 2; GX 12 at 8.) In a personal subject interview
(PSI) in August 2017, Applicant told the investigator that he bought a vehicle from a small
dealership and financed it with a loan from the dealership. When he received a bill for a
large sum of money from the dealership that he could not pay, he surrendered the vehicle.
(GX 2 at 8-9.) At the hearing, he admitted that the debt is not resolved. (Tr. 102-03.)
SOR ¶ 1.i: collection account for $2,118. In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he
denied this debt and claimed that it was a fraudulent debt opened in his name. (Answer
at 1.) The credit reports reflect that the collection account was opened in January 2015
and that the last activity on the debt was in November 2013. (GX 10 at 2; GX 11 at 2; GX
12 at 13.) In the August 2017 PSI, he told the investigator that this debt had been paid
with a loan from the credit union alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. (GX 2 at 8-9.) At the
hearing, he admitted that he had taken no action to resolve it. (Tr. 103-04.)
SOR ¶ 1.j: student loan placed for collection of $1,186. In Applicant’s answer
to the SOR, he admitted this debt and stated that he was making payments on it. (Answer
at 1.) He submitted no documentation of payments. At the hearing, he testified that he
attended college on the GI Bill and had no student loans. (Tr. 104.) A credit report from
May 2019 reflects a student loan referred for collection in August 2013 for $1,186. (GX
10 at 2.) He has not attempted to resolve this debt. (Tr. 104.)
SOR ¶ 1.k: collection account for $1,124.  In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he
denied this debt.  In the August 2017 PSI,  Applicant  told an investigator that this debt had
been paid  with a debt-consolidation loan from the credit union alleged  in  SOR ¶¶  1.a and
1.b. (GX  2 at 8.)  At the hearing, he denied this debt,  claiming  that he has never had  an
account with the original creditor. (Tr. 105.) The debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.l:  debt  to  furniture-leasing  company  charged  off  for  $836.  In
Applicant’s  answer  to the  SOR, he stated that  this was  a fraudulent  debt.  This  debt  is
reflected in the May 2019 credit report as charged off in February 2017. (GX 10 at 2.) At
the hearing, he testified that he has made no effort to contract the creditor. (Tr. 105.) The
debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.m: cellphone account referred for collection of $730. In Applicant’s
answer,  he  claimed  that  the  debt  was  paid  when  he  switched  providers  and  the  new
provider paid off the old account. The last activity on this account was in May 2013. It was
referred for collection in October 2017. (GX 10 at 2.) At the hearing, he testified that he
referred this debt to a credit-repair company in 2017 but received no response from the
credit-repair company or the creditor. (Tr. 107.) He terminated his contract with the credit-
repair company after one year because they made no progress. (Tr. 109.) The debt is not
resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.n: credit-union debt charged off for $569. In Applicant’s answer, he
stated that this debt was included in a debt-consolidation loan. The creditor for this debt
is the same credit union alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. It was charged off in September
2014, before the judgments alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b were entered. (GX 10 at 2.) It
is likely that this debt was included in one of the judgments.
SOR ¶ 1.o: utility bill placed for collection of $306. In Applicant’s answer, he
stated that this debt was paid, and he has contacted the company to determine the basis
for this account. The last activity on this debt was in May 2018. It was placed for collection
in  October  2018.  (GX  10  at  2.)  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  still  has  an
account with this company, but he has not contacted the company to determine the basis
for this collection account. (Tr. 111.) He did not provide any evidence to show that his
account is current.
SOR ¶ 1.p: telecommunication bill placed for collection of $164. In Applicant’s
answer, he stated that this was a fraudulent debt. This account was placed for collection
in December 2017. (GX 10 at 2.) At the hearing, he testified that he contacted the creditor
and  was  informed  that  it  has  no  record  of  this  debt.  He  did  not  ask  the  creditor  for
documentation. (Tr. 112.) The debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.q:  telecommunication  bill  placed  for  collection  of  $1,516.  In
Applicant’s answer, he stated that this was a fraudulent debt. The service provider for this
debt  is the  same  as alleged in  SOR ¶ 1.p,  but  the  account number  is  different.  It was
placed for collection in July 2016. (GX 11 at 2.) At the hearing, Applicant testified that this
debt was for unreturned equipment. (Tr. 113.) He sent an email to the collection agency
on February 1, 2021, asking about the possibility of a payment plan. (AX A-3.) The record
does not reflect a response to his inquiry. This debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.r: satellite television bill placed for collection of $1,277. In Applicant’s
answer to the SOR, he stated that this debt was for unreturned equipment and that the
equipment was picked up by a representative of the service provider in his presence. (Tr.
113.) It appears that Applicant’s  testimony at the hearing may have confused this debt
with the debt in SOR ¶ 1.q. The date of last activity on this account was in May 2016. It
was placed for collection in August 2017. (GX 11 at 2.) At the hearing, he testified that he
never had an account with this creditor. (Tr. 114, 138.) On February 1, 2021, after the
hearing, Applicant made a payment arrangement providing for monthly $25 payments,
and he made the initial payment. (AX A-1.)
SOR ¶ 1.s: student loan past due for $500. In Applicant’s answer, he stated that
this was a fraudulent debt. It is reflected in the September 2016 credit report as a deferred
student  loan  opened  in  August  2012.  (GX  12  at  8.)  It  is  reflected  in  the  January  2018
credit report as more than 180 days past due. (GX 11 at 2.) It is reflected in the May 2019
credit  report as a collection account  assigned to  the government.  (GX 10 at  2.)  At the
hearing, Applicant testified that he had not tried to determine the basis for the adverse
credit-report entries. (Tr. 115.)
SOR ¶¶  1.t  and  1.u: telecommunication bills placed for collection of $942 and
$366. In Applicant’s answer, he stated that these are fraudulent debts. They are reflected
in the September 2016 credit report. The first was for cellphone service and was placed
for collection in September 2014. The second appears to be for other telecommunications
services,  and  it  was  placed  for  collection  in  September  2016.  (GX  12  at  8-9.)  At  the
hearing, Applicant testified that he contacted the creditor. (Tr. 114-15.) He submitted no
documentation showing that he had contacted the creditor or that the debts were being
resolved.
Applicant’s disability pay is $456  per month. His weekly gross pay  as a contractor
employee  is $1,362.40. His weekly net pay after taxes  and  the garnishment is $790.97.
(AX A.)  He pays $800 per month to his wife for  “rent,” $89  per month for  Internet service,
$300 every two  weeks for  groceries, $100 per  month  for video games, and  $80 per month
for  cigarettes. He  does not have  a savings account. He  has about $2,000 in  his checking
account.  He  intends to start a 401(k)  retirement account.  (Tr. 126-28.)  He  testified that he
does not know   his wife’s annual salary,  but it is more   than he earns. (Tr.   90.)  His wife
testified that they shared finances briefly after they were  married, but she  now  takes care
of most of  their living expenses. She was not  asked and  did not disclose  her annual  salary.
At the time of her testimony, she was not aware of Applicant’s financial problems  that are
alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 47-50.)
Guidelines G, Alcohol Consumption and J, Criminal Conduct
The  SOR  alleges  three  incidents  of  driving  while  intoxicated  under  Guideline  G
and cross-alleges the same incidents under Guideline J.
Applicant testified that his father, grandfather, and grandmother all suffered from
alcohol addiction. He first used alcohol at age 14. He started binge drinking every two
weeks at age 19. (AC C at 238.) He began drinking regularly in 2013, after he lost his job.
Before 2013, he drank socially but infrequently. (Tr. 60.).
Applicant was charged with DWI on February 2005. In his answer to the SOR, he
denied being charged or convicted. He stated that he was sitting in his mother’s parked
car and talking on the phone when the police searched the car and found his mother’s
prescription  drugs  in  the  glove  box  and  charged  him  with  possession  of  a  controlled
substance.  He  claimed  that  the  charges  were  “thrown  out”  because  there  was  no
evidence that he was intoxicated or was driving. However, the court records reflect that
his mother posted a $500 bond, he was arraigned in March 2005, and he pleaded guilty
to DWI. (GX 15.) This conviction is alleged in SOR ¶ 2.c.
Applicant was charged with DWI in April 2016 and convicted in September 2016.
This conviction is alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a. He testified that had been working late at night,
around 10:00 p.m., and he stopped at a parking lot to have a telephone conversation with
his wife that became tense. He testified that after the conversation ended, he went to a
nearby bar and had two or three drinks. (Tr. 117-19.) He was stopped as he was driving
home  at  about  1:00  a.m.  He  pleaded  guilty  and  was  sentenced  to  30  days  in  jail,
suspended,  fined  $250,  assessed  court  costs  of  $216,  and  placed  on  unsupervised
probation for two years. His driver’s license was restricted and he was required to install
an ignition interlock. (GX 13.)
Applicant  was  again  charged  with  DWI  in  September  2016  and  convicted  in
February 2017. His blood-alcohol content (BAC) was more than .15. He pleaded guilty
and was sentenced to 365 days in jail, with 305 days suspended, a fine of $1,000, court
costs  of  $236,  and  unsupervised  probation  for  36  months.  (GX  14.)  This  conviction  is
alleged in SOR ¶ 2.b.
After  Applicant’s  arrest  for  DWI  in  April  2016,  he  was  required  by  the  court  to
complete  a  12-week  substance  abuse  program.  (Tr.  66.)  After  his  DWI  arrest  in
September 2016, he was jailed, and the court informed him that he would not be released
on bond unless he was enrolled in a substance-abuse program.
On October 24, 2016, Applicant was admitted into a residential substance-abuse
program administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). On admission, he was
diagnosed with an alcohol-abuse disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and chronic low
back pain. (AX C at 272.) During his intake, he disclosed that for the past year he had
been drinking between a pint and a fifth of rum or brandy daily. (AC C at 61.)  His diagnosis
was later changed to alcohol dependence. (AX C at 1.) He was required to live at the VA
facility and could not leave without a pass. He received individual and group counseling,
was tested regularly for alcohol use, and was required to attend Alcoholics Anonymous
(AA)  meetings.  He  was  allowed  to  leave  the  facility  to  seek  employment.  The  facility
records reflect that he was cooperative, attentive, and compliant. He was discharged on
February 3, 2017, and immediately began working for his current employer. (AX C at 55.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  abstained  from  alcohol  until  September  2020.  The
evidence  indicates  that  Applicant  resumed  drinking  earlier  than  September  2020,
probably in July or August. He testified that he resumed drinking, thinking that one drink
would not be a problem, drank again two weeks later, drank a third time a couple days
later, and then realized he had a problem. (Tr. 66-67.) On August 31, 2020, he notified
his attorney that he had self-admitted into a medical facility and would be there for an
undetermined period. His attorney requested that the hearing scheduled for September
3, 2020, be postponed. Applicant submitted no documentation of the dates of this period
of rehabilitation, but his testimony is corroborated by his attorney’s correspondence about
postponing the hearing and his attorney’s multiple updates about his projected completion
dates for the rehabilitation program. The correspondence about the postponement and
rescheduling of the hearing is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I.
Applicant  submitted  no  evidence  about  the  content  of  this  recent  rehabilitation
program. He submitted no evidence of a diagnosis or prognosis by a medical professional
associated with the program. He testified that he has abstained from alcohol and attended
AA meetings every other day since his completion of the rehabilitation program in October
2020. (Tr. 70.) He provided no documentation of his AA participation.
