Applicant  was  born  in  Iraq  to  Iraqi  parents.  He  worked  under  dangerous
conditions  in  Iraq  as  a  linguist  in  support  of  the  U.S.  mission  from  2003  to  2004,  and
again from 2007 to 2009. Because of his work, he was eligible for a special immigrant
visa. He immigrated to the United States in 2010, and he became a U.S. citizen in 2015.

Applicant  married  his  wife  in  Iraq  in  2009.  She  immigrated  to  the  United  States

the United States. (Tr. at 20-21, 29-30; GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s  parents  worked  as  geologists  for  the  Iraqi  government  before  they
immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  2014.  They  became  U.S.  citizens  in  about  2019.
They  live  about  a  short  distance  from  Applicant  and  spend  a  lot  of  time  with  their
grandchildren. (Tr. at 34-43; GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s  two  brothers,  parents-in-law,  brothers-in-law,  sisters-in-law,  aunts,
uncles,  and  other  extended  family  members  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Iraq.  His
brothers’  applications  to  immigrate  to  the  United  States  are  pending.  One  brother  was
able  to  apply  to  immigrate  in  his  own  right  because  he  also  worked  in  support  of  the
U.S.  mission.  Applicant  sponsored  his  other  brother  for  immigration.  (Tr.  at  51-58;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3)
Applicant’s  parents-in-law  applied  to  immigrate  to  the  United  States,  but  the
applications  were  denied.  His  father-in-law  was  a  senior  military  officer,  but  he  retired
about 18 years ago. He worked in Iraq for a U.S. multinational corporation for about 5
years,  and  he  has  been  retired  for  about  13  years.  (Tr.  at  44-48,  67;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1-3)

Hussein regime. Applicant believes his uncle worked for the United States for a period
in about 2003 to 2004. He has worked in a shop for about 15 years. His application to
immigrate to the United States was denied. (Tr. at 59-67; Applicant’s response to SOR;

Applicant  and  his  wife  have  assisted  several  family  members  and  friends  to
immigrate to the United States. Applicant has not returned to Iraq since he arrived in the
United States in 2010. His wife made three trips to Iraq with their children to visit their
family,  and  she  expected  to  make  another  trip.  Applicant  expressed  his  undivided
loyalty to the United States. He credibly testified that his family in Iraq could not be used
to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information, and that he would report
any attempt to do so (Tr. at 28, 31, 68-72, 82-84; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
