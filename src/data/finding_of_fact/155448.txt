In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, and
2.a, and he partially admitted and denied the allegations in SOR ¶ 2.b. (HE 3) He also
provided mitigating information. (Id.) He denied the remaining SOR allegations. (Id.) His
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.

1995 to 2001, and from 2004 to 2012. (Tr. 55, 61; GE 1 at 24-25) In 2016, he married his
fourth wife. (GE 1 at 22-23) His two children are ages 15 and 30. (Tr. 29; GE 1 at 27-28)
In  2016,  he  received  a  college  education-related  certificate.  (GE  1)  He  requires  35
additional college credits to receive his bachelor’s degree. (Tr. 29; GE 1)
Applicant served 24 years in the Air Force, and in June 2013, he was honorably

courses.  (AE  A)  After  retiring  from  the  Air  Force  he  worked  overseas  for  almost  eight
years  as  an  expert  in  munitions.  (Tr.  30-31)  He  was  recently  promoted  to  be  a
superintendent. (Tr. 31)
Financial Considerations
The  SOR  alleges  financial  consideration  security  concerns  based  on  six
allegations. The status of each allegation is as follows:
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  allege  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  and  state
income tax returns for tax years 2014, 2016, and 2017. He has resided overseas since
2013.  (Tr.  42;  SOR  response  at  1-2)  According  to  Executive  Order  No.  12744,  the
overseas  country  where  he  has  lived  has  been  designated  as  a  combat  zone  since
January  17,  1991,  for  purposes  of  filing  deadlines  for  tax  returns.  See  IRS  website,
Combat Zones Approved for Tax Benefits, https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/combat-zones.
(AE F) As a civilian contractor, Applicant was eligible for the filing extension to the same
IRS  website,  Eligibility  for  Military  Tax  Benefits,
extent  as  military  personnel.
https://www.irs.gov/individuals/military/eligibility-for-military-tax-benefits. (AE G)
According to Applicant’s state of residence Department of Taxation and Revenue,
Applicant does not need to file for an extension to file his tax return in his state of reference
because the  state  “honors  [his] federal automatic  extension of  time  to  file.” (AE I at  2)
Applicant believed that he was entitled by IRS and state tax rules not to file his tax returns
until  he  returned  to  the  United  States  from  his  overseas  deployments.  (Tr.  43-45)
Notwithstanding Applicant’s right not to file federal income tax returns under IRS and state
tax  filing  rules,  he  elected  to  file  his  tax  returns  in  2018.  He  has  filed  all  required  tax
returns. (Tr. 44-45) He intends to timely file all future required tax returns. (Tr. 72)
to  File  a  State  Tax  Return
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant owes $479 in delinquent state taxes for tax year 2017.
Applicant indicated he was not required to file a state tax return, and thus, he did not owe
taxes. (SOR response at  3) He also believed he did  not have to file a state tax return
because he was no longer a resident of the state. (Tr. 45) He may be incorrect about not
needing  to  file  a  state  tax  return  because  he  retained  his  home  in  the  state  and  may
therefore continue to be subject to that state’s taxes. See U.S. Tax Help website, Am I

income is from the state and not mentioning property ownership in the state as a factor).
Applicant did not indicate where his employer had its headquarters. The state also bases
residency on the location of source of income. Applicant said he paid the state $479, and
he may seek a refund. (Tr. 47) He did not contact the state and inform the state he was
no longer a resident. (Tr. 72) He has not registered to vote in any state in the last seven
years. (Tr. 73)
if
SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  Applicant  has  an  account  placed  for  collection  for  $765.
Applicant  said  he  was  overseas  when  his  credit  card  was  illegally  used  in  the  United
States. (SOR response at 3) He indicated this debt is not his debt, and he is the victim of
identity  theft.  (Id.)  Applicant’s  January  26,  2021  credit  report  indicates  he  disputed  his
responsibility for the debt with the credit reporting company. (Tr. 48; GE 7)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant’s mortgage account is more than 120 days delinquent
in the approximate amount of $7,962 on a total balance of $253,178. In 2009, Applicant
purchased his residence for $290,000 in the state where he was filing his state tax returns.
(Tr. 50-51) He understood when he obtained the funds from the mortgage company that
he was assuming the responsibility to make his mortgage payments. (Tr. 67) He was on
active duty and stationed at a nearby Air Force base. (Tr. 50-51) He said activity at the
Air Force base was subsequently reduced. (Tr. 51) He did not provide any statistical or
other corroborative information showing the base was reduced in population or economic
activity. He  said  the nearest town is economically depended on the Air Force base. (Tr.
51) He  was solely responsible  for  the mortgage. (Tr. 52) He  was earning about $3,000
per month when he qualified for  the loan. (Tr. 52) He  received a pay raise after he retired
from  the Air Force and became employed by a DOD  contractor. (Tr. 62)
From 2009 until September 2013, Applicant lived in his home. (Tr. 53) He made
his mortgage payments until March 2019. (Tr. 55, 65) He chose to stop making payments
on his mortgage for five reasons: (1) his home has been on the market for six years; (2)
the missions at the nearby Air Force base changed; (3) in January 2019, the house was
vandalized, and items were stolen from it such as furniture and appliances; (4) real estate
values  in  the  area  of  his  residence  decreased;  and  (5)  the  fair  market  value  of  his
residence may be down to about $160,000 to $170,000. (Tr. 57-58, 68, 86; SOR response
at 4) In January 2019, two vehicles and other items were stolen from his residence. (SOR
response at 4) He filed a police report and insurance claim for $30,000 after the 2019
burglary because of damage to his residence; however, his insurance claim was not paid.
(Tr. 83, 87) He stopped having the house cleaned after February 2019. (Tr. 88) Around
June  2019,  he  ended  his  relationship  with  a  real  estate  agent  who  was  attempting  to
market his property. (Tr. 88) He did not employ another real estate agent. (Tr. 88) Then
in 2021, there was a second theft from his house where the house was basically cleaned
out including parts of the plumbing. (Tr. 84) He has not yet filed a police report concerning
the second theft. (Tr. 84)
A real estate agent told Applicant around August 2020 that there was an offer to
purchase his residence; however, the real estate agent said it was about $50,000 under
expectations. (Tr. 85) The real estate agent suggested he let the house go into foreclosure
because there was no interest from purchasers apparently at the listed price. (Tr. 58-59)
The mortgage was already delinquent at the time the real estate agent suggested he let
the property go into foreclosure. (Tr. 68) He had some contacts from potential buyers;
however, none of them resulted in offers acceptable to the mortgage company. (Tr. 89)
He  did  not  detail  the  amounts  of  offers  or  indicate  he  actually  provided  them  to  the
mortgage company. He did not indicate the mortgage company’s acceptable price or how
much he would have to pay to complete the sale.
Applicant believed the mortgage lender foreclosed on his house; however, he had
not heard for sure what happened. (Tr. 59) He did not have any idea about how much his
liability might be. (Tr. 60) He was essentially waiting to hear from the mortgage lender
about  whether  they  wanted  money  from  him.  (Tr.  59-61)  He  indicated  after  paying  his
monthly  child  support  of  $800,  and  his  $1,891  monthly  mortgage  payment,  that  his
monthly remainder was about $3,000. (Tr. 65-66, 78, 83) He was capable of continuing
to make his mortgage payments. (Tr. 66-67, 80) There was no outside event in March
2019 that caused him to stop making his mortgage payments aside from his decision that
he was losing money by making his payments and his recognition that his property was
valued less than the mortgage or “underwater.” (Tr. 72)
Applicant’s  January  26,  2021  credit  report  reflects:  the  Department  of  Veterans
Affairs  (VA)  guaranteed  repayment  of  his  mortgage;  the  date  of  last  payment  was
February 2019; the past due amount was $41,839; and the monthly payment was $1,880.
(GE 8) Applicant was unaware of the amount the VA guarantee. (Tr. 80) The last time
Applicant checked the value of his residence on the Internet, he learned the value was
about $210,000 to $215,000. (Tr. 81)
Under VA rules, “The  veteran’s basic entitlement amount is $36,000. If  the loan
amount  exceeds  $144,000,  an  additional  amount  of  entitlement  is  available,  for  a
maximum entitlement of 25 percent of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit for a single-
family residence (currently $417,000 . . . ).” VA website, VA Guaranteed Home Loans at
8,  available  at  https://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/documents/docs/va101handout
.pdf . . . . The maximum potential guaranty is $104,250, if the veteran has full eligibility.”
(HE 8) Applicant will  not have  to repay the VA  unless the VA  finds “evidence of fraud,
misrepresentation, or bad faith on [his] part.” VA website, VA help to avoid foreclosure,
available
https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/trouble-making-
payments/ (HE 9). Applicant did not provide any information about correspondence with
the VA after he stopped making payments to the mortgage lender.

On February 21, 2020, the Notice of Sale on his former residence indicated the
amount of the judgment due is $264,943. (AE J-2) On March 31, 2020, the foreclosure
sale of Applicant’s residence was delayed to May 29, 2020. (AE J-1) Applicant said he
believed his house was foreclosed in January 2021. (Tr. 91) He said he gave a document
to his attorney in January 2021 indicating the property was foreclosed. (Tr. 82) He said
he  believed  the  foreclosure  amount  was  $212,000  and  the  mortgage  was  $260,000
resulted  in  a  “$40,000”  difference.  (Tr.  91)  The  document  showing  the  completed
foreclosure is not part of the record. On April 15, 2021, Applicant’s counsel indicating he
was unable to provide documentation showing the final disposition of the residence, and
the amount Applicant may owe to the mortgage lender. (AE M)
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  Applicant  has  an  account  placed  for  collection  for  $931.
Applicant said he paid this bill in September 2019. (Tr. 49-50, 76-77; SOR response at 5)
Applicant  has  about  $50,000  in  his  bank  account.  (Tr.  75)  His  social  security

The Philippines
The U.S. and the Philippines maintain a close relationship stemming from the U.S.
colonial period (1898-1946), the bilateral security alliance bound by the Mutual Defense
Treaty of 1951, and common strategic and economic interests. Relations are based on
strong historical and cultural links and a shared commitment to democracy and human
rights. In 1946, the United States recognized the Philippines as an independent state and
established diplomatic relations. The U.S. has since designated the Philippines as a Major
Non-NATO Ally. Former U.S. President Barack Obama visited the Philippines in 2014 to
reaffirm the United States' commitment to the security alliance, and to discuss the United
States'  strategic  vision  for  the  bilateral  relationship.  President  Obama  noted  the  two
nations'  strong  people-to-people  ties,  commitment  to  peace  and  stability  in  the  Asia-
Pacific region, and commitment to build prosperity for our people and the global economy.
Although  the  U.S.  closed  its  military  bases  in  the  Philippines  in  1992,  the  two
nations have maintained security cooperation ever since. The Manila Declaration, signed
in 2011, reaffirmed the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty as the foundation
for a robust, balanced, and responsive security partnership. Since 2012, the Philippines
has  played  a  key  role  in  the  U.S.  goal  of  rebalancing  foreign  policy  priorities  to  Asia,
particularly  as  maritime  territorial  disputes  between  China  and  other  claimants  in  the
South China Sea have intensified.
In  2014,  the  two  countries  confirmed  agreement  of  an  Enhanced  Defense
Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), which helps promotes the peace and stability that has
underpinned Asia's remarkable economic growth over the past six decades. The EDCA
allows for the increased presence of U.S. military forces, ships, aircraft, and equipment
in the Philippines on a nonpermanent basis and greater U.S. access to Philippine military
bases. As part of the security alliance, Members of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps have
conducted  Cooperation  Afloat  Readiness  and  Training  (CARAT)  exercises  with  the
Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) since 1995. The training exercises develop strong
partnerships that contribute to the greater peace and stability of the region and allow both
nations to gain valuable experience and increase our interoperability. The U.S. and the
Philippines have the same mission, that is, to further strengthen the Philippines' security
operations and maritime domain awareness capabilities. The U.S. has begun to provide
$40  million  in  technical  expertise,  training,  and  equipment  through  the  Global  Security
Contingency  Fund.  The  U.S.  is  also  helping  to  construct  a  Philippine  National  Coast
Watch Center in Manila.
In the past decade, the Philippines has been one of the largest recipients of U.S.
foreign  assistance  in  Southeast  Asia,  including  over  $143  million  following  Typhoon
Yolanda  (Haiyan)  in  2013.  U.S.  assistance  in  the  Philippines  fosters  broad-based
economic growth; improves the health and education of Filipinos; promotes peace and
security;  advances  democratic  values,  good  governance,  and  human  rights;  and
strengthens regional and global partnerships. The U.S. and the Philippines have a strong
trade and investment relationship, with over $25 billion in goods and services traded. As
the Philippine's third-largest trading partner, the U.S. is one of the nation’s largest foreign
investors. The Philippines has been among the largest beneficiaries of the Generalized
System  of  Preferences  program  for  developing  countries,  which  provides  preferential
duty-free access to the U.S. market. In 1989, the two countries signed a bilateral Trade
and Investment Framework Agreement and a tax treaty.
An enhanced engagement of 15 U.S. government agencies is aiming to address
the  most  significant  constraints  to  growth  in  the  Philippines  and  to  stimulate  inclusive
economic expansion through a Partnership for Growth (PFG). USAID and the Millennium
Challenge Corporation account for the majority of PFG financial resources amounting to
more than $750 million. The two countries have made enormous strides in deepening the
economic linkages between them, including: Removal of the Philippines from the Special
301  Watch  List,  based  on  significant  advances  in  the  protection  and  enforcement  of
intellectual  property  rights  and  considerable  progress  on  worker  rights  issues  in  the
Philippines,  which  will  allow  the  U.S.  government  to  close  a  Generalized  System  of
Preferences (GSP) review of worker rights in the Philippines without any change to the
Philippines' GSP trade benefits.
The Philippines and the U.S. share extensive people-to-people ties. About 350,000
Americans  reside  in  the  Philippines,  and  approximately  600,000  U.S.  citizens  visit  the
country each year. There are approximately four million people of Philippine descent in
the U.S. The Philippines has the world's oldest continuous operating Fulbright program:
the Philippine-American Educational Foundation, established in 1948. The U.S. has had
a Peace Corps program in the Philippines for over 50 years.
The Philippines is a multiparty, constitutional republic with a bicameral legislature.
President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, elected in May 2016, began his constitutionally limited
six-year term in June 2016.
Since the 1980’s at least five Americans, including Leandro Aragoncillo, have been
convicted  of  espionage,  or  espionage-related  crimes,  involving  transmission  of
information to the Philippines. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, there have
been numerous criminal cases concerning export enforcement related to the Philippines.
As  of  September  2020,  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  travel  advisory  for  the
Philippines  is  Level  3:  Reconsider  Travel  Due  to  COVID-19.  Additionally,  Exercise
Increased  Caution  due  to  crime,  terrorism,  civil  unrest,  a  measles  outbreak,  and
kidnapping. It directed Americans: Do Not Travel to the Sulu Archipelago, including the
southern Sulu Sea, due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and kidnapping and to Marawi
City in  Mindanao due  to  terrorism  and  civil unrest. It suggested citizens reconsider travel
to other areas of  Mindanao due  to crime, terrorism, civil  unrest,  and kidnapping. It noted
that the  Philippine government has declared a State of National Emergency on Account
of  Lawless Violence in  Mindanao.  Philippine government law enforcement agencies are
engaged in a nationwide  counternarcotics campaign that has resulted in  a sharp increase
in  violence between  police  and  individuals suspected of involvement in  the drug trade. As
part of this  campaign, law enforcement is engaged in aggressive search and  buy-bust
operations   that   could  affect   foreigners.   The   U.S.  Department  of  State  has  assessed
Manila as being a  high-threat  location for  terrorism  directed at  or  affecting official  U.S.
government interests.  Terrorist violence  continues to affect primarily the Mindanao region,
in the country’s south.
At least eight terrorist groups operate in the Philippines. For more than a decade,
terrorists, insurgents, and criminal actors have carried out major attacks against civilians.
In 2018, four notable attacks resulted in the deaths of two to eleven people and numerous
additional  people  were  injured.  In  2019,  the  Philippines  made  the  list  of  the  top  10
countries with the most terrorist incidents and the most terrorist casualties. There were
351  incidents  in  the  Philippines,  with  1,192  casualties  (3  percent  of  the  global  total  of
casualties). This constitutes a small increase in incidents over 2018, as well as a seven
percent increase in casualties. The most deadly attack involved a bombing of a Mass at
the Jolo Cathedral in Sulu killing 23 people and wounding 102. Multiple suicide bombings
in  the  Philippines  were  a  new  phenomenon  for  the  region.  On  August  24,  2020,  dual
suicide bombings in Jolo, Sulu and Mindanao, killed 15 people and injured 77 others.
The  State  Department  designated  the  Philippines  a  major  money  laundering
jurisdiction in 2019. The Philippines’ growing economy and geographic location within key
trafficking routes place it at elevated risk of money laundering and terrorism financing.
Recent growth in the online gaming industry also presents increased risk. Corruption and
human trafficking constitute some of the principal sources of criminal proceeds. Insurgent
groups  operating  in  the  Philippines  derive  funding  from  kidnapping  for  ransom  and
narcotics and arms trafficking. Additionally, the large volume of remittances from Filipinos
living abroad increases the monitoring burden on anti-money laundering authorities.
In its most recent annual human rights report, the State Department reported that
significant  human  rights  issues  included:  unlawful  or  arbitrary  killings,  including
extrajudicial killings, by and on behalf of the government and non-state actors; reports of
forced disappearance by and on behalf of the government and non-state actors; torture
by and on behalf of the government and non-state actors; arbitrary detention by and on
behalf  of  the  government  and  non-state  actors;  harsh  and  life-threatening  prison
conditions; arbitrary and unlawful interference with privacy; significant problems with the
independence of the judiciary; the worst forms of restrictions on free expression and the
press, including violence, threats of violence, and unjustified arrests or prosecutions of
journalists, censorship, and the existence of criminal libel laws; corruption; and unlawful
recruitment  or  use  of  child  soldiers  by  terrorists  and  groups  in  rebellion  against  the
government.
10
Concerns  about  police  impunity  increased  significantly  following  the  sharp
increase in killings by police in 2016. Significant concerns also persisted about impunity
for  the  security  forces,  civilian  national  and  local  government  officials,  and  powerful
business  and  commercial  figures.  Slow  judicial  processes  remained  an  obstacle  to
bringing government officials allegedly involved in human rights abuses to justice.
