Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal
income tax returns for a number of years.  He also failed to timely file state income tax
returns for State #1, for State #2, and for State #3.  Applicant owes delinquent Federal
and  state  back  taxes,  medical  debt,  child  support,  and  consumer  debt  totaling
approximately $125,000.  He is also behind on his mortgage payments.  In his answer,
Applicant admits each of the allegations listed in the SOR, with the exception of n, p, q,
r, s, and z, which he states have fallen off of his credit report and believes is no longer
owing.  Applicant’s credit reports dated August 10, 2017; March 1, 2019; and November
10, 2020, confirm this indebtedness.  (Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5.)
Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the  United  States  Army  from  2002  through
2007.  He joined the Army Reserves in 2016, and is currently an E-5.  Applicant held a
security clearance from March 2002 when he joined the Army, until June 2014.
Applicant worked for a defense contractor in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2013.  He
testified that until October 2013, he always paid his taxes and his bills on time, and lived
within his means.  (Tr. p.35.)  He was able to accumulate things such as a house, cars,
and debt, and was able to properly manage the expense.  At that time, he was earning
about $167,000 annually.  (Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.)  In October 2013, when
his daughter ran away from home, Applicant took emergency leave from Afghanistan to
come  back  to  the  states  to  find  her.  Accusations  of  child  abuse  against  his  wife,
instigated  a  court  hearing  in  November  2013.  The  court  found  against  the  Applicant
and his wife, and they lost custody of their children.  Applicant then returned to work in
Afghanistan.  (Tr. pp. 21 - 23.)
At this point, Applicant made a life altering decision to quit his good paying job in
Afghanistan that he had for almost five years, and return to the United States to fight for
custody  of  his  children.  Applicant  understood  the  consequences.  He  knew  that  his
finances would be negatively impacted, preventing him from paying his bills.  Applicant
testified  that  his  priority  was  his  family,  including  their  long  term  safety  and  stability.
Applicant  spent  the  next  three  years  in  court  fighting  for  custody  of  his  children.  He
spent  his  money on  attorneys  and court  fees.  He was  eventually  awarded  custody of
his youngest daughter.  (Tr. p. 37.)
In July 2017, Applicant was hired by his current employer.  At that time he knew
that his job would require a security clearance.  He did not tell  his employer about his
excessive indebtedness.
The  following  delinquent  debts  in  the  SOR  remain  owing  and  are  of  security
concern:
1.a.,   through  1.c.   Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  Federal  income  tax  returns  for  years
2013;  2014;  2015;  2016;  2017;  and  2018.  Applicant  states  that  he  has  now  filed  his
Federal income tax returns.  Supporting documentation shows that these returns have
now been filed.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  There is no supporting documentary evidence
to show that his state income tax returns have been filed.  Applicant has not filed and/or
did not timely file his state income tax returns for State #1 for tax years 2013 and 2014;
for State #2 for tax years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018; or for State #3 for tax years
2018 and 2019.
1.d.,  through 1.j.  Applicant  became indebted to the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS) for
numerous tax years.   He owes the IRS for tax year 2010 in the amount of $1,838.30; tax
year 2011 in  the amount of  $23,013.56; tax  year 2012 in  the amount of  $13,369.51;  tax

(Government  Exhibit  2.)     Applicant   testified  that  in   total,  he  believes  that  he  owes
approximately $53,000 in  back taxes to the  IRS.  (Tr. 38.)  At one point he had  set up a
payment  plan  to  pay   $1,000  monthly,   but  has  been  unable   to   comply  with  the
arrangement because  he is now unemployed.  Applicant has not contacted the IRS to
explain his situation to them.  (Tr. p. 41.)
1.k.,  through  1.m.    Applicant  owed   back   taxes  to  State  #2   for  tax   year  2013  in   the
amount of $3,014.91,  and for  tax  year 2018 in  the amount of $2,123.60.  He  claims that
he  has  filed  a  dispute  with  this  state  tax   authority,  and   he  does  not  owe  the  taxes.
Applicant failed to submit any documentary evidence to substantiate this claim.  (Tr. p.
40.)    He   also  owed   back  taxes  to   State   #3   for  tax   year  2018  in   the   amount  of   $485.
Applicant  admits  that  he  has  not   paid  these  taxes.    (Tr.  p.   39.)     Applicant  submitted
copies  of  income  tax   returns   for  tax   years   2018  and   2019  for  State  #3.    (Applicant’s
Post-Hearing Exhibit A.)
1.n.,  through 1.r.  Applicant owes numerous consumer debt.  This includes a mortgage
account that is past due in the amount of $18,907 with a total balance owed of $83,725.
The account remains delinquent, but has been frozen in foreclosure pending the COVID
19  pandemic.  A  second  mortgage  account  on  the  same  house  is  past  due  in  the
amount  of  $841  with  a  total  balance  owed  of  $2,120.  A  debt  owed  to  a  creditor  was
charged off in the amount of $8,811.  A debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the
amount of $5,960.
1.s.   Applicant owed child support arrears in the amount of $4,944. He testified that in
May  2019,  when  the  court  transferred  child  custody  to  him,  the  court  also  erased  all
past due child support.  (Tr. pp. 77 and 78, and Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.)
1.t.,  through  1.v.  A  debt  owed  to  a  creditor  was  placed  for  collection  in  the  amount  of
$2,650.  A debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the amount of $2,192.  A
debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the amount of $2,101.
1.w.  Applicant owed child support arrears in the amount of $1,786. He testified that in
May  2019,  when  the  court  transferred  child  custody  to  him,  the  court  also  erased  all
past due child support.  (Tr. pp. 77 and 78, and Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.)
1.x.,  through 1.cc.  A debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the amount of
$1,725.  A  debt  owed  to  a  creditor  was  charged  off  in  the  amount  of  $1,704.  A  debt
owed to a creditor was charged off in the amount of $1,474.  A debt owed to a creditor
was placed for collection in the amount of $1,079.  A debt was owed to a creditor was
charged off in the amount of $570.  A debt for a medical account is owed in the amount
of $270.  (Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5.)  There is no evidence in the record to show
that any of these debts have been paid.
It  is  noted  that  some  of  the  debts  set  forth  above  do  not  appear  on  Applicant’s
most recent credit report.  (Government Exhibit 5.)  Under the particular circumstances
of  this  case,  their  absence  from  the  credit  report  is  not  affirmative  evidence  that  the
debts have been resolved.  According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, in some cases,
derogatory accounts may fall off of the credit reports after seven years.  This does not
mean that the debt is no longer owing.
Applicant believes that financial management classes would be helpful to him.  (Tr.
pp.  85  - 86.  He  realizes  that  his  past  poor  decisions  have  negatively  impacted  his
finances.  He  testified  that  he  has  many  close  friends  who  are  currently  active  duty
military, National Guard, Army Reserves and the like.  He further testified that he would
never do anything, under any circumstances, to endanger their lives, or put his freedom
or his country in danger.  (Tr. pp. 25 - 26.)
Applicant’s  performance  appraisal  for  2019  is  favorable.
It  indicates  that  he  has
“exceeded” and/or “substantially achieved” the expectations of the job in every category.
(Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.)
