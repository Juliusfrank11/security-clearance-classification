Applicant is a 44-year-old engineer for a defense contractor, employed since 2004.
Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in 2003 and has  some credits toward a master’s
degree.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  from  1995  to  1999,  when  he  was  honorably
discharged.  Applicant  is  not  currently  married  and  has  no  children.  He  was  previously
married and divorced from 1994 to 1999, and 2012 to 2014. Applicant has had security
eligibility since 2006.
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant owes approximately $58,516 in
14  delinquent  debts  and  a  home  foreclosure  in  2015.  Applicant  admitted  the  SOR
allegations, and provided explanations and documentation with his Answer.
Applicant began accumulating debts in 2013. He feared layoffs at his work would
affect him, so he began to save money instead of paying debts and expenses. He accrued
credit cards and increasing debt and living beyond his means. (GE 2) He lived in a home
that he could not afford, and his income fell short of his expenses. Applicant also admits
to  irresponsible  financial  decisions  with  his  home,  credit  cards,  loans,  and  vehicles.
Applicant allowed his debts to accumulate because of their “enormity.” In 2014, Applicant
divorced. He consulted an attorney to file a petition in bankruptcy and paid him $3,000.
He  was  advised  however,  that  his  income  was  too  high  to  qualify  for  a  Chapter  7
bankruptcy. Applicant declined to file a Chapter 13 because it was “not within his goals.”
Applicant  defaulted  on  his  mortgage  and  in  2015,  his  home  mortgage  was
foreclosed and the property was reclaimed to satisfy the debt. (SOR ¶ 1.a) Applicant has
been paying on bank or credit card collection accounts alleged as SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.m
after judicial action was taken to obtain a judgment for the accounts. He also obtained
settlement offers on bank collection accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.o, however, he
has not made payments on the settlements as of the hearing date. The remaining SOR
debts are unpaid and Applicant has not taken action to resolve them.
Applicant intends to address a charged off car loan that was reduced to judgment
in 2017 and 2019. The creditor offered to accept two lump-sum payments, and Applicant
intends to address this debt next. He also owes the IRS $5,728 for unpaid Federal taxes
from 2017 and 2019, and was to begin paying $1,000 per month beginning in November
2020. Applicant claimed that he has already paid off IRS debts for 2017 and 2018 through
a payment plan. He noted that he intentionally delays paying taxes when they are due so
that  he  can  accumulate  savings.  He  has  not  changed  his  employment  withholding  to
address his end-of-year tax obligations.
Applicant expressed a personal preference to keep cash rather than pay debts or
the IRS. He obtained a $30,000 loan against his 401K retirement plan in 2017. He used
about $15,000 to put a down payment on a vehicle, and used about $15,000 for vacations.
Applicant earns about $100,000 per year, and he currently has savings of about $15,500.
Applicant  considers  his  savings  to  be  for  emergencies,  not  to  pay  debts.  He  has  not
sought financial counseling.
