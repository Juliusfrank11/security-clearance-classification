Applicant  is  a  63-year-old  senior  systems  engineer  for  a  defense  contractor,
employed since 2007. Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in 1988. He was enlisted in
the U.S. Navy from 1975 to 1988, and was a commissioned officer from 1988 until he
retired in 1996. He deployed four times and has three personal awards. Applicant married
in 1979, separated in 2007, and divorced in 2014. He remarried in 2016, and has four
adult children. He was last granted security eligibility in 2007.
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to file Federal income tax
returns and pay Federal income taxes from 2004 to 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.a); failed to file state
income tax returns and pay state income taxes for tax years 2013 to 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.b);
Federal tax liens were entered against him in 2012 and 2016 for approximately $14,467
(2012) (SOR ¶ 1.e), $66,075 (2012) (SOR ¶ 1.f), and  $17,632 (2016) (SOR ¶ 1.c); a state
tax  lien  was  entered  against  him  in  2015  for  approximately  $11,437  (SOR  ¶  1.d);  and
charged-off  and  collection  accounts  totaling  approximately  $3,458  (SOR  ¶¶  1.g  –  1.j).
Two debts listed as SOR ¶¶ 1.j and 1.h are duplicates and will be considered under SOR
¶ 1.j.
While Applicant was married to his first spouse, he became delinquent on Federal
and state income taxes and failed to file certain returns when due. He stated that he was
often  deployed  while  serving  in  the  Navy,  and  he  had  a  difficult  relationship  with  his
spouse. He became aware that his spouse had not filed income tax returns in about 2000.
In 2003 or 2004, he used a commercial tax service to help resolve his tax issues, but he
was not clear what they were able to accomplish. As part of the divorce, Applicant took
responsibility for the delinquent taxes.
Applicant admits that from 2008 to 2011, he failed to take charge of his tax filings,
and became concerned about the amount he owed the IRS. As alleged in the SOR, he
did  not  timely  file  Federal  tax  returns  or  pay  taxes  owed  from  about  2004  to  2011.
Although he had a portion of his pay deducted from his salary for taxes, it was not enough
to  cover  his  tax  obligations,  and  he  began  to  accumulate  interest  and  penalties.  He
became paralyzed with fear and took no action to correct his past tax delinquencies.
After  2011, Applicant  started repaying his  Federal  tax obligations,  and  has paid
about $100,000 to date. The IRS garnished his pay in 2011 or 2012, and recovered about
$5,000 per month over a one-year period. Thereafter, Applicant negotiated a repayment
plan with the IRS and began paying $1,000 per month directly from his bank account.
Applicant has shown regular and consistent payments since at least 2015, except for one
dishonored payment in August 2020, which he intends to correct. He currently owes about
$50,000 to the IRS. He has filed all of his tax returns to date, but his 2013 Federal and
state tax returns were filed late due to late delivery of documents to his accountant. His
brother-in-law is an accountant and files his tax returns. His Federal tax liens have not
yet been released.
Applicant owes State A about $25,000 for tax years 2013 to 2015. He was living in
State A, but working in State B, and had his withholding sent to State B. Applicant has
been making payments toward State A’s past-due taxes since 2017, and paid off about
$10,000 toward the debt. He currently pays $300 per month in a payment plan. State A
released the tax lien noted in SOR ¶ 1.d. Applicant resolved all of the credit card debts
alleged in the SOR. His 2020 credit report shows no accounts in a collection status.
Applicant’s current spouse began living with him in 2011. Since that time, except
for the 2013 returns that were filed late, all tax returns have been filed and paid when due.
His spouse testified that she has helped him correct his tax issues since she moved in
with him, and noted that she will never let tax returns go unfiled. They discuss financial
matters and work  together  to ensure  all tax  returns are filed and taxes  are paid.  Their
combined household income is about $180,000 per year. Applicant earns the majority of
the income. He has not sought  financial counseling, but uses an accountant to file tax
returns  when  due.  He  currently  utilizes  a  budget  and  he  has  a  $500  net  monthly
remainder. He owns a home, two paid-off cars, and has about $1,500 in savings.
Applicant  has  been  very  active  in  leadership  roles  of  a  church  and  civilian
charitable  organizations,  and  submitted  favorable  letters  from  a  friend  in  one  of  the
organizations,  a  coworker  and  supervisor.  All  attest  to  Applicant’s  service  to  his
community,  church,  and  work.  They  note  Applicant’s  integrity,  loyalty,  and  dedication.
Applicant noted that he has taken responsibility for his poor financial decisions in the past,
and has taken positive step to correct them.
