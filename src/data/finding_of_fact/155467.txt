Applicant is a 49-year-old security officer. He has served in that capacity with the
same  government  contractor  for  24  years.  He  has  maintained  a  security  clearance
without adverse incident for over two decades. He also works a part-time position with
another entity. (Tr. 25) Combined, Applicant is employed for at least 70 hours a week.
(Tr. 25) In addition, he has worked multiple hours as part of a five-year apprenticeship
within the field of investigative services. (Tr. 26) Income from this apprenticeship, which
appears to make him a self-employed independent contractor under the auspices of a
trainer  or  mentor,  has  been  minimal.  (Tr.  28,  49-51)  He  is  personally  unsure  of  how
such work qualifies in terms of income and taxes.
In  sum,  Applicant  has  generated  a  gross  annual  income  of  approximately
$140,000. (Tr. 33) His wife earns between about $80,000 and $90,000 a year. (Tr. 34)
This  is  a  notable  increase  since  2015,  when  the  couple  had  a  joint  income  of  about
$152,000. (Tr. 48) They presently maintain their finances separately. (Tr. 34)
In terms of education, Applicant attended high school and has received financial
counseling  from  a recognized  entity. (Tr.  21)  Consequently,  he  maintains a  household
budget. (Tr. 21) Applicant employs others to prepare his taxes.  He is married and has
two  children,  ages  23  and  13.  The  eldest  child  recently  relocated  to  a  distant  state,
where  she  plans  to  continue  her  education.  Until  the  recent  pandemic,  Applicant’s  in-
laws lived with the family; they have since returned to their home country. Applicant is
presently selling his house of 14 years with plans to move to another area.
By  2017,  Applicant  had  acquired  some  commercial  debt,  represented  in  SOR
allegations 1.a-1.d., amounting to almost $48,000. He appears to mainly attribute this to
poor  tax  advice  and  tax  return  preparation,  related  tax  issues,  and  house  repairs.
Feeling  overwhelmed  in  about  September  2017,  Applicant  sought  the  advice  and
guidance  of  a  debt  relief  program.  He  then enrolled  in  that  program,  which  negotiated
settlements and made payments toward those debts. (Tr. 77-79, 82) He eventually left
that  program  in  favor  of  a  debt  consolidation  entity.  (Tr.  97;  see  also  Tr.  120-121)
Ultimately, those debts were satisfied. (See Exs. A-D; Tr. 15-16, 82-83, 88, 92-94)
At issue  in the SOR at allegations 1.e-1.h  are Federal tax  delinquencies for  tax
year  (TY)   2015  ($16,505),  TY  2016  ($16,105),  TY  2017  ($16,151),  and   TY  2018
($2,831),  respectively, cumulatively amounting  to about  $55,300. Applicant’s tax  records
are incomplete. His knowledge of his tax  situation  is somewhat limited because he had
others  prepare  his  tax   returns.   However,   his  documents   showed  that  he  has  been
making progress on his TY 2015  tax  debt  through an instalment agreement  since 2018,
and   reflected  that  he   has  made   initial  payments  toward  the  debts  owed  for  TY  2016-
2018. (Ex.  E) He  is unsure if he has yet completed all  payments toward TY 2015, but
noted that he started regular  instalment  payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
toward TY 2016 in  September 28, 2020. (Tr. 18) He  concedes regular payments toward
TY 2017-2018  have  not yet commenced, but will  move on to the  next year at issue  on
completion of the payments for TY 2016. (Tr. 19)
Finally, Applicant owed his home state of residence delinquent taxes amounting
to about $2,831 for TYs 2015-2016. This came about due to adjustments to his Federal
tax  obligation  for  that  time  period.  In  2019,  he  satisfied  the  combined  state  tax
obligation. (Tr. 19, 74; Ex. G) At present, he is up-to-date with all state taxes, consumer
credit accounts, and personal loans. (Tr. 75, 114) His only outstanding delinquent debts
are related to his Federal taxes, as noted above. (Tr. 103)
At present, Applicant’s checking account has a balance of about $4,000. (Tr. 34)
A  joint  401(k)  account  has  a  balance  of  about  $140,000.  Applicant  is  timely  on  the
$200,000 balance owed on his mortgage. His payments on the family automobiles are
timely. (Tr. 109) Those payments, amounting to about $12,000 a year, conclude in late
2020  with  the  satisfaction  of  the  underlying  loans.  (Tr.  36)  Applicant  was  having  a
monthly  net  remainder  of  about  $1,000.  (Tr.  36)  Now  that  pre-sales  home  repairs  are
complete, he anticipates a monthly net remainder of at least $3,000. (Tr. 37) Additional
money  will  be  available  when  the  car  payments  cease.  Applicant  now  employs
professionals to prepare his tax returns. He and his wife do not lead extravagant lives.
Applicant’s last vacation was in the Caribbean over three years ago.
