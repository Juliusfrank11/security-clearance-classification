Applicant admitted some of the allegations and denied others. Her admissions are
incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I
make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for
her current employer as an administrative professional  since February or March 2019.
Her job location is currently in Afghanistan. She has worked for a defense contractor in
either Afghanistan or Iraq for approximately 14 years. She served in the U.S. Army on
active duty for six years and was honorably discharged. She deployed to Iraq in 2003.
She attained her general educational development (GED) and has taken some college
courses. She has never married and has no children. She provides financial support for
her mother and sisters. (Tr. at 7, 26-30; GE 1)
The SOR alleged that Applicant had 20 delinquent collection and charged-off debts
totaling approximately $44,773. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.t) The debts are established by Applicant’s
admissions and entries on several credit reports. (GE 4-6; Answer to SOR)
Applicant’s financial difficulties were exacerbated by two significant events. In 2010
to 2011, she was between contractor deployments and decided to start her own business.
She accumulated some significant debts from this business start-up. Her business failed
and she became personally responsible for the delinquent debts. Thereafter, she started
working for another contractor in a deployed setting. The second incident that impacted
her finances was an injury she sustained while deployed in approximately 2015-2016. In
approximately  March  2015,  she  broke  her  foot  and  returned  state  side.  She  received
workers’ compensation due to her injury until about July 2016 when it stopped. She then
went through periods on unemployment and temporary employment until she was hired
by  a  defense  contractor  for  a  deployment  position  in  September  2017.  Since  2019,
Applicant has made a concerted effort to resolve her debts. (Tr. at 27-28; GE 2)
The status of Applicant’s delinquent debts is as follows:
