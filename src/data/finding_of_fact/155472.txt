Applicant’s husband currently lives with Applicant in the same household. (Tr. 36)
He is a calibration engineer. (Tr. 36) His annual salary is $67,000; however, he does not
provide  significant  financial  support  for  his  family.  (Tr.  36-37;  AE  QQ)  He  pays  for  car
insurance, the cable bill, and some household maintenance expenses. (Tr. 69; AE QQ)
After Applicant’s mother’s husband died, she moved in with Applicant, and she pays the

hospitalized several times for depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues; (2) her
son was unable to work because he injured his knee; (3) her husband had mental-health
problems  that  required  inpatient  and  outpatient  treatments  and  affected  his  ability  and
willingness  to support his family; and (4) Applicant had disruptions in her income from
changes in employment and her tenant’s  failures to pay rent. (Tr. 67; AE BB) Her finances
have  some  positive  aspects.  She  has  been  continuously  employed  for  the  last  three

The SOR alleges 10 delinquent debts totaling $45,803 and failure to file or timely
file tax returns as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns
for tax years 2011 through 2017. SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that she owes federal income taxes
totaling $31,234 for tax years 2011 and 2015.
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d allege Applicant failed to timely file her state income tax returns
for tax years 2011 through 2017.
Applicant filed as head of household for tax years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and

For tax year 2011, Applicant withdrew $159,900 from her pension plan. (AE B, IRS
Form 1040, line 16a) For tax year 2015, Applicant withdrew $42,100 from her pension
plan. (AE B, IRS Form 1040, line 15b) When Applicant took one of the withdrawals from
her retirement account, she thought she might be able to take a medical deduction for her
son’s mental health expenses; however, later she found out it did not qualify because it
was an education expense. (Tr. 53) These two withdrawals from her pension plan caused
most of her federal income tax debt.
In 2011, Applicant learned there was an issue with her state income taxes because
a  state  tax  authority  filed  a  lien  against  her  pay  for  $12,600.  (Office  of  Personnel
Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) at 7). She blamed the failure to file
her tax returns on her husband, and said it was due to his mental health issues. (Id.) The
lien started in April 2012, and it was resolved in 2017. (Id.)
On August 30, 2017, Applicant completed her SCA, and she stated:
[The IRS] provided me with what years I need to file and the information on
my  income  for  those  years  as  well  as  where  to  find  the  forms  and
instructions. Once I have filled out the forms as married filing single, I will
schedule another assistance appointment where I can turn them in and then
set up a payment plan for any amounts that are owed that day. The [IRS]
assistance office also provided information on [the] State office of taxation
in order to ensure I am able to file my state income taxes for those years as
well. I will be following up with the [state tax returns] once I have completed
each federal form. (emphasis added, GE 1 at 45)
Applicant did not specify in more detail the information she received from the IRS about
her income and withholdings for tax years 2011, 2013, and 2015.
On  September  20,  2017,  Applicant  responded  to  questions  from  an  OPM
investigator substantially as follows:
Subject provided her husband the documents needed to fill out the taxes
for  [tax  years  2011,  2013,  and  2015]  but  he  failed  to  do  so  due  to  his
depression. … Subject started filling out the paperwork needed to file and
will  set  up  a  payment  plan  after  she  finishes  the  paperwork.  Subject  is
prioritizing her taxes to the front of the list of things to pay and is willing and
capable of paying this debt. Subject had no further details.
For  unfiled  or  unpaid  state  income  taxes,  in  her  response  to  DOHA  interrogatories
Applicant indicated in a table that the state owed Applicant a refund for tax year 2011 and
provided a refund. (GE 2) For her state tax returns for 2013 and 2015, she wrote that she
was in the process of filing those tax returns. (OPM interview at 6) The OPM interviews
are  summaries  and  are  not  verbatim.  Applicant  made  the  handwritten  notes  on  the
margins on some pages such as “paid in full” by some debts which she intended to be
“corrections.” (GE 2)
On July 17, 2019, Applicant agreed to an IRS installment payment plan, in which
she agreed to make $453 monthly payments to address her $31,500 federal income tax
debt for tax years 2011 and 2015. (AE C) On July 25, 2019, Applicant responded to DOHA
interrogatories. (GE 2) On September 22, 2019, she paid the IRS $450, and on October
22, 2019, she paid the IRS $500. (AE D) Both payments went to address her tax debt for
tax year 2011. (Id.) On November 21, 2019, she arranged to have an automatic direct
withdrawal from her bank account paid to the IRS. (AE E; AE Z)
On November 25, 2019, the IRS reduced her refund for tax year 2013 to $3,800.
(AE F) She was unable to receive the federal income tax refund for tax year 2013 because
her tax return was filed more than three years late. (Tr. 58)
Since September 2019, Applicant has made all payments under her IRS payment
plan, and along with her refunds, she has reduced her federal income tax debt to about
$14,000. (Tr. 28)
Applicant  timely  filed  her  state  income  tax  return  for  tax  year  2017.  (AE  G)  In
October 2020, Applicant filed her state income tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2015.
(Tr. 31, 59; AE DD) She owes the state tax authority $500 for tax year 2013, and $2,000
for tax year 2015, and she is waiting for the state to contact her about a payment plan.
(Tr. 60; AE DD)
Applicant said that she did not know her federal income tax returns were not filed
because her husband had filed them in the previous years. (Tr. 53-56) He used Turbotax,
which  is  a  computer  and  Internet-based  system  that  does  not  require  a  taxpayer’s
signature to file tax returns. (Tr. 73-74) She said she discovered her tax returns were not
filed when a state tax entity contacted her about her tax return for tax year 2011, and she
suggested this discovery occurred in 2016 or 2017 possibly in July or August 2017. (Tr.
54-56,  74)  She  did  not  explain  why  she  believed  from  2012  to  2016  or  2017  that  her
husband, who was suffering from mental health issues and who failed to file a state tax
return around 2012 or had filed an incorrect state tax return, could be entrusted with filing
her tax returns.
After Applicant received the letter from the state tax entity about not filing a state
tax return, she went to an IRS office in August 2017, and asked which federal tax returns
were not filed. (Tr. 54-55; GE 1) The IRS informed her that her federal income tax returns
for tax years 2011, 2013, and 2015 were not filed. (Tr. 56)
Applicant said she spent the next two years gathering information to file her tax
returns for tax years 2011, 2013, and 2015. (Tr. 57) She said, “the federal transfers given
to me at the IRS office [did] not include the state numbers. And [she] had to track down
[her] W-2 forms for 2015. The company had been sold. And due to COVID they couldn’t
[give her] the tax, the W-2 form until recently.” (Tr. 59) When she delivered the tax returns
to the IRS, the IRS stamped them indicating the IRS received them. (AE B)
The  lack  of  W-2s  does  not  excuse  a  failure  to  timely  file  a  tax  return.  When  a
taxpayer lacks documentation, such as a W-2, the correct approach is to contact the IRS
seeking help to obtain a W-2, and in any event, a tax return should be timely filed with an
estimate of income and taxes withheld. See IRS website, Form W-2 Missing? IRS Can
Help, available at https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/form-w-2-missing-irs-can-help.
In sum, Applicant timely filed her federal income tax returns for tax years 2014,
2016, 2017, and 2018. (Tr. 50; AE A; AE B) She filed federal income her tax returns late
for  tax  years  2011,  2013,  and  2015.  She  paid  her  federal  income  tax  debt  down  from
$31,000  to  about  $14,000  through  monthly  tax  payments  in  accordance  with  her  IRS
settlement agreement and through IRS transfers of refunds for tax years 2016, 2017, and
2018. (Tr. 57-58) In October 2020, she filed her state income tax returns for tax years
2013 and 2015, and she owes the state about $2,500.
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant has a past-due debt for $1,646, and the total debt is
$7,742.  She  made  consistent  payments  for  several  years;  however,  a  credit  card  was
compromised,  and  this  caused  a  break  in  payments  for  several  months.  (Tr.  62)  On
October 19, 2019, the creditor indicated the amount of her debt was $7,281, and the next
$155  payment  was  due  on  November  15,  2019.  (AE  H)  She  made  five  $155  monthly
payments from June to October 2019. (AE H) From October 2019 to October 2020, she
made  eleven  $155  payments.  (Tr.  31,  62;  AE  EE;  AE  FF)  The  creditor  indicated  her
account is “currently on-time.” (AE I)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a medical account placed for collection for $1,556. In October
2020, Applicant made her first payment on her $35 monthly payment plan. (Tr. 31, 62;
AE GG)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges a charged-off account for $792. In November 2020, Applicant
established a $25 monthly payment plan for this account, and she made the first payment.
(Tr. 32-33, 62; AE J; AE HH)
SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i allege accounts placed for collection for $449 and $386 owed
to the same creditor. Applicant mistakenly thought these debts were paid. (Tr. 64) Once
she realized they were delinquent, she paid them in full in 2019. (Tr. 33, 64-65; AE L; AE
JJ)
SOR  ¶  1.j  alleges  a  charged-off  department  store  account  for  $303.  Applicant
attempted to pay the debt; however, the creditor would not accept payment because it
was beyond the statute of limitations. (Tr. 33-34, 65)
SOR  ¶  1.k  alleges  an  insurance  account  placed  for  collection  for  $300.  On  an
unspecified date, Applicant established a $50 monthly payment plan with the creditor. (Tr.
34, 65; AE II)
SOR ¶ 1.l alleges a medical account placed for collection for $2,482. Applicant has
a payment plan with the creditor, and she made the first two payments. (Tr. 34-35, 66)
SOR ¶ 1.m alleges a utility account placed for collection for $559. Applicant has a
payment plan with the creditor, and she made the first payment. (Tr. 35; AE JJ)
Applicant received financial counseling, and she provided a budget. (Tr. 71;  AE
AA; AE QQ) Her annual gross salary is $119,000, and she receives an additional $5,000
annually from her part-time employment. (AE QQ) Her monthly net remainder is $468.
(Id.) Applicant does not use credit cards. (Tr. 68) She is unsure of the status of some of
her family’s recent medical bills. (Tr. 68)
Character Evidence
Coworkers, supervisors, and friends described Applicant in positive terms. (AE Q;
AE R; AE CC) The general sense of their statements is that she is intelligent, innovative,
professional, detail oriented, helpful, honest, reliable, conscientious, and trustworthy. (AE
Q; AE R; AE CC) She has an exceptionally strong reputation as a diligent and dedicated
employee. (AE Q; AE R; AE CC) Her positive work attributes contributed to the success
of the enterprises where she is employed. (AE Q; AE R; AE CC) There is no evidence of
security violations or criminal conduct.
In  2009,  Applicant  received  a  Society  of  Logistics  Award  and  a  certificate  of
appreciation  from  the  Department  of  Labor  for  her  contributions  to  a  data  collection
program.  (AE  O;  AE  S)  Her  performance  review  for  2019  showed  good  to  excellent
evaluations. (AE P) She received additional awards for her contributions to her employer,
the Boy Scouts, and the Army. (AE S) In 2019, she received an $800 performance award
and a 1.8 percent pay increase. (AE S) She contributed to her community as a paramedic
from  1995  to  2001,  to  the  fire  department,  Boy  Scouts,  Girl  Scouts,  Junior  Miss,  a
recreation center, her church, and various volunteer and youth activities. (AE BB at 4-5)
Request for Evidence
At  the  conclusion  of  the  hearing,  I  asked  Applicant  to  provide  additional
documentation:
And ma’am if you can find those letters where you were first notified, I need
to make a timeline in this case of when you discovered the tax returns were
not filed. And then what you did about those tax returns. Because the filing
of the tax returns is the key determinant in this case, because of the Appeal
Board’s jurisprudence. So, I have to look very carefully at whether you acted
responsibly  in  connection  with  filing  those  tax  returns.  .  .  .  [I  have  to
determine] were you responsible when you filed those tax returns, after you
discovered they were not filed? So, I have to nail that down. (Tr. 87-88)
Applicant  did  not  provide the  letter  or  letters  of  notification she received  about  her  not
filing tax returns. She did not provide the IRS tax transcripts for tax years 2011, 2013, and
2015, which may have contained information about the IRS attempts to notify her about
the missing tax returns. She provided a statement from her husband; however, he did not
admit that he was responsible for filing Applicant’s tax returns or that he misled her about
filing  tax  returns.  (AE  MM)  She  did  not  ask  for  additional  time  to  seek  additional
documentation.
