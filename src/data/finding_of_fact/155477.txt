Applicant  is  a  50-year-old  single  man.  He  graduated  from  college  in  1993,  earning  a  bachelor’s  degree  in
business administration, and he earned a master’s degree in business administration in 2003.
Applicant  is  the  owner  and  chief  executive  officer  of  a  company  that  provides contract  services  to  federal
government  clients.  (Tr.  49;  AE  C)  When  he  started  the company in 2008, he was the only employee. By 2019,
the company employed 115 people. In 2020, the company’s annual gross revenue totaled approximately $19.7 million
dollars. (Tr. 49) According to the company’s chief operating officer, who has worked for Applicant for the last three
years  and  known  him  for  16  years,  Applicant  is  a  well-respected  individual  who  excels  in  his  work.  (Tr.  24)
Applicant  is  a  humanitarian  who  donates  significant company  resources  to  charities,  targeting  youth  who  are
either  underprivileged,  or underrepresented in certain professional fields, and families with food insecurity. (Tr. 78)
Applicant has held a security clearance since 2008.
Applicant used marijuana from 2016 to approximately June 2019. (Answer at 5) He consumed it in cookie or
brownie  form.  He  began  using  it  to  reassure  a  friend  who  had  been  prescribed  it  to  control  pain  related  to  multiple
sclerosis  and  was  hesitant  to  use  it.  In  an  effort  to  reassure  her,  Applicant  told  her  that  “[he  would]  try  it  with
[her].”  (Tr.  53) Subsequently, Applicant “used it to relax and get a good night’s sleep,” approximately once per  month
in  social  settings  and  on  vacations.  (GE  1  at  41;  GE  3  at  8;  Supplemental Answer at 4)
When  Applicant  disclosed  his  marijuana  use  on  his  2018  security  clearance application,  he  noted  that
he  “might”  use  it  again  in  the  future.  (GE  1  at  41)  As  time  elapsed,  his  intention  to  continue  using  marijuana
became more definitive. Specifically, in his  subject  interview  he  stated  that  he  was  likely  to  use  it  again,  and  in
response  to interrogatories, completed in June 2019, he answered “Y” in response to the question, “[d]o you intend to
use this drug in the future?.” (GE 2 at 3)
Applicant no longer uses marijuana. It is unclear from the record when Applicant stopped using marijuana. In
his  Supplemental  Answer  of  March  2020,  he  stated  that  he  had  not  consumed  marijuana  since  January  2019.
(Supplemental  Answer  at  15)  Earlier,  in  his  response  to  interrogatories  completed  in  June  2019,  he  noted  that  he
used marijuana on
“various dates throughout  the  year,” and  intended  to smoke it in the future. (GE 2 at 3),  Applicant  testified  that  he
“was  not  fully  as  present  as  [he]  should  have  been”  when disclosing the dates of his marijuana usage. (Tr. 88)
Applicant  executed  an  affidavit  in  November  2019  stating  his  intention  never  to  use  marijuana  again.
(Supplemental  Answer  at  39)  In  February  2021,  he  executed  an  affidavit  stating  that  he  had  complied  with  the
previous affidavit and reiterated his intent not to use marijuana in the future. (AE A)
Applicant  used marijuana  under  “the wrongful impression  that  [he] could use [it while] holding a clearance so
long  as  the  state  laws  provided  for  legal  use,  despite  the  fact  that  marijuana  usage  is  still  prohibited  under  federal
law.”  (Supplemental  Answer  at  17)  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  his  marijuana  use  stemmed  from
“ignorance  of  not understanding  the  gravity  of  holding  on  to  a  clearance  .  .  .  .”  (Tr.  52)  Currently,  he  is attending
education  programs,  and  disassociating  himself  from  social  events  where marijuana use occurs. (Supplemental
Answer at 15)
In  January  2014,  Applicant  was arrested and charged with driving/attempting to drive  under  the  influence  of
alcohol (DUI), after pulling over to the side of the road to go to sleep upon leaving a night club. (Answer, Enclosure 3
at 6 - 7) He was sentenced to one year of probation, a monetary fine, and 30 days of jail time, suspended.
Applicant  now  takes  a  cab  or  an  Uber  home  if  he  drinks  alcohol  during  social outings. (Tr. 68) He has had
no alcohol-related incidents since the 2014 arrest.
Applicant  failed  to  report  his  DUI  arrest  to  his  facility  security  office,  as  required  by  the  National  Industrial
Security  Program  Operating  Manual  (NISPOM),  Chapter  1,  Section  3,  paragraph  1-300.  Also,  he  did  not  report  his
marijuana use to his facility security office, as required. When Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI, he was
serving as the facility security officer (FSO) of his company. Unaware of the process of reporting oneself on the JPAS
system,  he  decided  to  wait  until  the  next  Defense  Security  Services  audit  to  disclose  the  adverse  information.  (Tr.
62-64) There is no record evidence that he made such a disclosure. Moreover, contrary to Applicant’s testimony that
he disclosed  the 2014 DUI arrest on his 2018  security clearance  application,  he did not actually  disclose  it until  his
investigative interview in October 2018. (GE 1; GE 2 at 20)
As Applicant’s company continued to grow, he began to recognize how untenable it was for him to balance his
CEO  managerial  responsibilities  with  the  security  maintenance  and  oversight  responsibilities  of  an  FSO.
Consequently,  in  2020,  he  hired  an  FSO.  (Tr.  61;  AE  B)  The  FSO  developed  a  security  compliance  program  and
installed an intranet. Also, the  FSO  tracks  the  requisite  trainings  for  employees  to  complete,  and  he  publishes  a
monthly security newsletter for the company. (Tr. 62-64)
During the federal government sequestration of 2013, Applicant lost a government contract which represented
90  percent  of  his  business.  (Tr.  70;  Answer  at  41)  Absent  this  income,  the  business  began  to  struggle,  and
Applicant  could  not  afford  to  pay  his
expenses.  In  2014,  he  consulted  an  attorney  who  advised  him  to  restructure  his  debt  through  filing  for  Chapter  13
bankruptcy  protection.  (Tr.  69)  Applicant  took  his  attorney’s  advice  and  filed  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  protection  in
February 2014. (Tr. 69)
After Applicant reviewed the proposed plan, he was not confident that he had the income to successfully execute
it.  Upon  his  attorney’s  advice,  he  withdrew  the  petition  and  refiled  a  few  months  later  in  July  2014  after  he  had  been
awarded  more  contracts  and  was  in  a  stronger  position  to  comply  with  a  Chapter  13  debt  resolution  plan.  (Tr.  70)
Ultimately, Applicant paid 100 percent of his debt through the second bankruptcy plan, three years ahead of schedule.
(Tr. 72)
Currently, the only debt Applicant has is his home mortgage. (Tr. 76) His business has grown continuously since
2014, and grossed $19.7 million of revenue in 2020. (Tr. 74) Applicant  earned  a  salary  of  $161,544  in  2020  through  his
business,  and  a  salary  of approximately $114,000 through another business that he started in 2018. (HE I)
