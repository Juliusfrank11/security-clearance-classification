In Applicant’s SOR response, he denied all of the SOR allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a
through 1.d and ¶ 2.e. (HE 3) He admitted SOR ¶¶ 2.a through 2.d, ¶ 2.f, and ¶ 3.a. (Id.)
He also provided mitigating information. (Id.)
Applicant is a 44-year-old  Iraqi  and United States dual citizen who seeks a security
clearance to enable him  to regain employment as  a  linguist.  (Tr. 7) In 1995,  he graduated
from  high school  in  Iraq, and  in  1998, he graduated from a technical institute in  Iraq.  (Tr.
7) From 2005 to 2008, he served as a linguist with U.S. armed forces in Iraq. From 2009
to 2010, Applicant  worked as a  part-time role player for the U.S. Army  in  the United States.
(November 7,  2017, Office of  Personnel  Management (OPM)  report of  investigation (ROI)
at 6)  In 2010, he married, and  in  2013, he  divorced. (Tr. 7-8)  His son is  a nine-year-old
citizen  of Iraq  who resides in  Jordan. (Tr. 8)  In 2013, Applicant  became a U.S. citizen,
and in 2014, he received a U.S. passport. (SCA)
Financial Considerations
From 2011 to 2014, Applicant repaired six used cars damaged in accidents and
then he sent them to Iraq where they were sold. (Tr. 85-87, 92) He received $11,500 for
one car and $18,000 for another of the cars. (OPM ROI at 11) After paying expenses, he
said he did not make a profit on the sale of the vehicles. (AE B) Some of the cars were
used for a time by his relatives living in Iraq. (Tr. 83-84) He may have given one of the
cars to his father, and then his father received the proceeds from the sale of this car. (Tr.
85-87) He did not declare any income from the sale of the cars on his federal or state tax
returns. (Tr. 85-86) There was no evidence presented that contradicted his statement that
he received no income or profit after paying expenses from the sale of the six cars.
In 2012 or 2013, Applicant sold a house in the United States for about $260,000,
and he made a profit of around $100,000. (Tr. 80-82; OPM ROI at 11) In July 2017, he
loaned $90,000 to an uncle who lived in the United States to pay off his uncle’s house.
(Tr. 62; OPM ROI at 11) As of November 2017, his uncle had repaid $37,000; however,
the remainder was not repaid. (Id.; AE C at 1)
According  to  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS),  the  gain  on  the  sale  of  a
residence of up to $250,000 is excluded from income for federal income tax purposes if
“owned and used [by the taxpayer as his or her] main home for a period aggregating at
least two years out of the five years prior to its date of sale.” Internal Revenue Service
website,  Topic  No.  701  Sale  of  Your  Home,  available  at  https://www.irs.gov/
taxtopics/tc701.  An  information  return  is  not  required  unless  the  seller  receives  an
“income-reporting  document  such  as  Form  1099-S,  Proceeds  From  Real  Estate
Transactions,” or has a non-excludable gain. (Id.) Applicant used the profits from the sale
of his residence for living expenses when he was unemployed or underemployed, and to
purchase or repair the six cars that he hoped to sell for a profit in Iraq. (Tr. 83-87) The
SOR did not allege that Applicant failed to disclose income on his tax returns. Applicant
did not disclose the profit on the sale of his residence on his tax returns, and he was not
asked to indicate how he qualified for the IRS homeowner’s exclusion. It was clear from
his overall testimony that he had very limited knowledge of IRS rules on exclusions from
income and inclusions to income.
The SOR alleges in ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d that Applicant failed to timely file federal
and state tax income returns for tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016. On
November  7,  2017,  Applicant  told an OPM  investigator  that  he did  not  file federal and
state tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016 because he did not make enough money to
file. (OPM ROI at 10) The OPM ROI does not indicate how much income Applicant made
in 2015 and 2016. (Id.)
When Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories, he left the lines blank in the
table for listing the filing dates for his state and federal income tax returns for tax years
2010, 2011, and 2012. (GE 2 at 2) He  indicated that he  filed his federal and state tax
returns as follows: for tax year 2013 on April 14, 2014; for tax year 2014 on April 13, 2016
(one year late); for tax year 2015 and 2016, he said he did not make enough income to
necessitate filing a tax return; for tax year 2017, he filed on March 3, 2018; and for tax
year 2018 he filed on March 13, 2018. (GE 2 at 2-4) He did not indicate his income that
he presumably reported on his state and federal income tax returns for tax year 2014.
Applicant  provided  some  IRS  tax  transcripts.  His  IRS  tax  transcripts  issued  in
March 2021 indicate: (1) His tax transcripts were unavailable for tax years 2010 through
2014; (2) For tax year 2015, his income was $0, and no federal income tax return was
filed; and (3) For tax year 2016, his income was $11. (AE B)
Applicant said his federal and state tax returns for tax year 2010 were filed in March
or April 2011. (Tr. 68-69) For tax year 2010, his Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) was $5,799;
his filing status was married filing jointly; and he received a $1,601 refund. (SOR response
at 38) His state tax return indicated he was supposed to receive an $830 refund. (Id. at
40-41) The copies of his state and federal income tax returns that he provided are not
signed or dated. (Id. at 38-46)
Applicant said his federal and state tax returns for tax year 2011 were timely filed.
(Tr.  70-72)  For  tax  year  2011,  his  AGI  was  $11,152;  his  status  was  married  filing
separately or single; and he owed $1,479 when he filed his tax return. (SOR response at
47-48) He said he paid the IRS with a check. (Tr. 69-72) His reported income from an
auto  body  business  was  on  an  IRS  Form  1099-MISC.  (SOR  response  at  49-53)  He
received an $811 refund from the state tax authority. (Id. at 63) The copies of his state
and federal tax returns that he provided are not signed or dated. (Id. at 47-63)
For tax  year 2012, his AGI was $12,268; his status was  married filing separately
or single; and  he owed $1,742  when he filed his tax  return. (SOR response at 68-69) He
owed the state tax  authority $401  when he filed his state tax  return. (Id. at 78-79) The
copes of his state and federal tax returns he provided  are not signed or dated. (Id. at 68-
83)  His federal income tax  return was electronically accepted by the IRS on February 4,
2013. (Id. at 66) He paid his federal taxes when due. (Tr. 70-73)
For tax year 2013, Applicant’s IRS federal income tax account transcript indicated
his AGI was $29,831; his status was single; and he owed $4,206 when he filed his tax
return. (GE 2 at 7) He paid the $4,206 federal income tax debt when he filed his tax return.
(Id.) The IRS received his payment on April 19, 2014. (Id.)
In  November  2013,  Applicant  was  in  a  serious  vehicle  accident.  (Tr.  74-78)  His
shoulder was injured, and he was unable to work or was underemployed from 2014 to
June 2016. (Tr. 76; SOR response at 4-36; OPM ROI at 5) His employment in auto sales
for several years was limited because of lack of business. (Tr. 78)
In 2015 and 2016, the IRS income thresholds for the requirement to file a federal
income  tax  return  for  a  single  person  under  age  65  were  $10,300  and  $10,350,
respectively.  See  IRS  Publication  501,  Exemptions,  Standard  Deduction,  and  Filing
Information  For  use  in  preparing  2015  and  2016  Returns,  tbl.  1,  pg.  2,  available  at
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/p501--2015.pdf  and  https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/
p501--2016.pdf. In 2015 and 2016, the Applicant’s income thresholds for the requirement
to file a state tax return for a single person under age 65 was $4,000 for both years. See
2015 and 2016 Individual Income Tax Forms and Instructions, MI-1040, at 3, available at

Only 545985  7.pdf.
For tax year 2017, Applicant’s IRS federal income tax account transcript indicated
his AGI was $2,206; his status was single; and he received a $5 refund after receiving a
$170 earned income credit. (GE 2 at 9)  For tax year 2018, Applicant’s IRS federal income
tax  account  transcript  indicated  his  AGI  was  $11,369;  his  status  was  single;  and  he
received a $265 refund after receiving a $201 earned income credit. (Id. at 11)
On  July  9,  2019,  the  state  tax  authority  wrote  that  Applicant  filed  his  state  tax
returns for tax years 2009-2013 and 2017-2018, and there were no outstanding liabilities.
(GE 2 at 13) The state did not indicate when the state tax returns were filed.
In sum, Applicant admitted that he failed to timely file his federal and state income
tax returns for tax year 2014. He filed these two tax returns on April 13, 2016 (one year
late). Applicant denied that he had sufficient income in tax years 2015 and 2016 to require
him to file state or federal income tax returns, and there was no evidence to contradict his
statement.
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 3.a alleges that Applicant’s August 2, 2017 SCA, in Section 26, “Financial
Record – Taxes, asks “In the past seven (7) years have you failed to file or pay Federal,
state, or other taxes when required by law or ordnance?”  Applicant answered “no”  and
allegedly did not report his failure to timely file federal and state tax returns in tax years
2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and/or 2016.
Applicant explained why he indicated “no” as follows:
I made a mistake actually back then because I thought -- I know, every year,
like, I’m doing my taxes. That’s what I know. Like, I’m doing it. Every year I
go and file my taxes and do all the proper paperwork and pay the check and
pay how much I owe. I get refund. That’s all I know about. In 2015 and 2016,
just before the economy was, like, not good here in, like, [Applicant’s state
of  residency].  And  the  business  is  not  really  helped.  So  plus  I  was
unemployed, like, most of the time from here to there. I don’t know why I
said no because I thought that I’m paying my taxes and then I . . . I don’t
know how to do it basically to be honest. I went to the IRS. And I requested
the 2010, and I requested the taxes. But actually, they didn’t give me or they
didn’t put me in a situation to pay it. Like, I’m willing to pay it if I can pay it
right now if I owe any money. I’m not trying to hide anything. I thought this
is the honest answer. I spoke my heart at that second when I answered the
question. [Tr. 88-89]
Applicant indicated he did not think he had to file a tax return because of his lack of income
in  2015  and  2016.  (Tr.  87-89)  In  regard  to  preparation  of  tax  returns,  he  went  to  a
professional tax preparer, and he filed whatever he believed he was supposed to file. (Tr.
87-89) Applicant indicated he did the best he could to answer the question about filing tax
returns honestly and in good faith. (Tr. 95)
Foreign Influence
The SOR alleges that Applicant had the following connections to Iraq and Jordan:
in SOR ¶ 2.a, his son is a citizen of Iraq and a resident of Jordan; in SOR ¶¶ 2.b and 2.c,
his brother and five sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq; in SOR ¶ 2.d, he has 14
foreign  contacts  or  connections  to  persons  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Iraq;  in
¶  2.e,  as  of  September  2017,  he  provided  about  $10,500  in  financial  support  to  his
relatives in Iraq; and in SOR ¶ 2.f, he provides $1,800 annually in financial support to his
sister in Iraq.
Applicant was born in Iraq. (Tr. 23) He was educated through the technical school
level  in  Iraq.  He  was  in  Iraq  from  September  2015  to  April  2016  to  assist  his  mother
because she was ill, and she required two serious surgeries. (Tr. 63-65) He also went to
Iraq to initiate the documents to enable his parents to leave Iraq to go to the United States.
(Tr. 63-65) In February of 2017, he was in Iraq for about two weeks to bring his parents
to the United States. (Tr. 63-64) He has not returned to Iraq since 2017. (Tr. 64) He does
not intend to return to Iraq unless it is for employment as a linguist or to bring his siblings
to the United States. (Tr. 66) He wants to bring all of his siblings to the United States. (Tr.
66)
Applicant has five sisters and  one brother who are citizens and  residents of Iraq.
(Tr. 24) He  has monthly contact with his brother. (Tr. 35) In  2016  or  2017, he sent $1,800
to his sister,  and  she sent his brother $600  out of the $1,800. (Tr. 37, 43-44; OPM ROI at
7) From  2007 to 2009,  Applicant’s brother worked for the United States as a  gate guard
and  linguist  in  Iraq. (Tr. 38-41)  Applicant  has monthly contact with his five sisters and  four
out of five of his brothers-in-law. (Tr. 45, 50-53) He  ended his contacts with his father-in-
law when he got divorced. (Tr. 53-54) His contacts with three aunts and two cousins has
been reduced to annually or less  frequently than annually. (Tr. 53-55)  He  has monthly
contact  with  one   friend  and   quarterly  contact  with  another  friend  who  are   citizens   and
residents  of Iraq.  (Tr. 59, 61) He  has reduced or ended  his contacts for  about two years
or more with  several friends who are citizens and  residents of Iraq.  (Tr. 59-60) The  Iraqi
government does not  employ any of  his siblings. (Tr. 35) There is  no evidence  the Iraqi
government employs any of his contacts in Iraq.
Applicant’s son lives in Jordan with his mother. (Tr. 45-46) She filed for divorce in
Jordan in 2014. (Tr. 48) When Applicant went to Jordan in 2011 to visit his wife and son,
he was delayed in Jordan until he paid a child support settlement of about $1,500. (Tr.
48-50; OPM ROI at 7, 9) Under Jordanian law, he is not required to pay any more child
support. (Tr. 50) He communicates with his son every three to four months. (Tr. 50) He is
estranged from his former spouse, and he has not spoken to her since 2012. (Tr. 48-50;
OPM ROI at 7)
Applicant had a friend in Iraq with a car dealership. (Tr. 57) Applicant ended his
business  relationship  with  him  in  2017.  (Tr.  57)  Applicant  sent  him  a  one-time  wire
transaction for $18,000 in connection with the car business. (Tr. 57)
On  March 1,  2017,  Applicant   sponsored  his  parents   to   obtain  a  U.S.  Visa;   they
moved from Iraq to the United States;  and  now  they live with him.  (Tr. 35; OPM ROI at 7)
Applicant  plans  to  help  his  parents  apply  for  naturalization  to  become  U.S.  citizens  in
December 2021. (Tr. 20) His parents know that he has applied to be a linguist; however,
they do not know  anything else  about his employment plans. (OPM ROI at  6) Applicant
has not disclosed to family living  in  Iraq that he is seeking a security clearance. (Tr. 62-
63)  He   acknowledged   that  if  Iranian  elements  in   Iraq  learn  of  his   support   for   the  U.S.
Government, his  family living in  Iraq  is at  risk of  being harmed. (Tr. 62-63)  He offered  to
renounce  his Iraqi  citizenship; however,  he has never been asked to renounce  it. (OPM
ROI at 4)
In 2005, the U.S. Army recruited Applicant as a linguist. (Tr. 24-26) First he worked
at  a  gate  helping  to  screen  persons  seeking  access  to  the  base;  then  he worked  with
education and training of personnel involved in counterterrorism; and then from January
2007 to August 2008, he worked with U.S. Army Special Forces. (26-30) In August 2008,
he immigrated to the United States. (Tr. 31)
In  Iraq,  Applicant’s  mission  from  January  2007  to  August  2008  was  to  help  to
collect information from intelligence sources and then accompany the military to arrest
criminals and terrorists. (Tr. 32) Applicant was in danger on missions up to three times a
week.  (Tr.  32)  He  was  close  to  the  detonation  of  three  improvised  explosive  devices
(IEDs) and one vehicle borne IED. (Tr. 33-34) His injuries during these incidents were
minor,  and  he  was  able  to  resume  his  linguist  duties  after  a  short  period  of  rest  and
recuperation. (Tr. 34)
On July 3, 2008, a Special Forces Assistant Detachment Commander (ADC) wrote
that  Applicant  had  been  an  interpreter  for  U.S.  Army  Special  Operations  Forces  since
January 2007. (AE A at 14) Applicant previously served with the U.S. Army for two years.
(Id.) He “is available whenever he is needed, no matter what the hour or the mission calls
for.” He “is trustworthy and completely devoted to the success of the Coalition Forces in
Iraq.”  The  Special  Forces  ADC  attested  to  the  risks  Applicant  faced  because  of  his
contributions to the U.S. military, stating:
[He] has accompanied the team on at least 280 combat missions in hostile
territory . . . . He has taken enemy fire with the team and has been part of
an ODA convoy when it was struck by an IED. Besides the danger he faces
in operations with the ODA, is the danger he faces when he returns home
to [his] province. Many members of his community discourage cooperation
with  Coalition  Forces,  and  would  likely  punish  [Applicant]  and  his  family
severely if they found out about his work. . . . I would highly recommend
[Applicant] receive an immigration Visa to protect his family from the harsh
consequences that are sure to follow his cooperation with the United States.
In my opinion he has earned his place among Americans, as he has risked
his life to serve and protect them. (AE A at 14)
In 2008, another member of  the Counter-Terror Coalition Forces in  Iraq  indicated
Applicant  completed  “over  250   missions”  and   he  described  Applicant  as  “dedicated,
honest,  and  trustworthy –   a tremendous asset.”  He  said:  “Despite numerous threats to
his personal  and  family safety,  [Applicant] has remained steadfast in  his support  of the
United States  Armed Forces in   Iraq,  working long hours, maintaining an unpredictable
schedule, and  volunteering to support the  SFODA’s most  sensitive missions.” (AE A at
13)
In  2010,  an  Army  lieutenant  colonel,  who  is  a  battalion  commander  in  an  Army
combat division, praised Applicant for his reliability, professionalism, and contributions to
training his unit before their deployment. (AE A at 15) Applicant received 12 certificates
and letters of appreciation from various Army units. (AE A at 16-27)
Iraq
The Federal Republic of Iraq (Iraq) is a constitutional parliamentary republic. Iraq’s
2018  parliamentary  elections  generally  met  international  standards  of  free  and  fair
elections and led to the peaceful transition of power from Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi
to  Adil  Abd  al-Mahdi.  On  December  1,  2019,  in  response  to  protesters’  demands  for
significant changes to the political system, Abd al-Mahdi submitted his resignation, which
the Iraqi Council of Representatives (COR) accepted. Prime Minister Abd al-Mahdi has
continued to serve in a caretaker capacity while the COR works to identify a replacement
in accordance with the Iraqi constitution.
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  (DOS)  travel  advisory  for  Iraq  is  Level  4:  Do  not
travel to Iraq due to terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, the Global Health Advisory, and
Iraq’s limited capacity to provide support to U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high
risk for violence and kidnapping. Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in
Iraq  and  regularly  attack  both  Iraqi  security  forces  and  civilians.  Anti-U.S.  sectarian
militias threaten U.S. citizens and Western companies throughout Iraq. Attacks by IEDs
occur in many areas of the country, including Baghdad.
On  May  15,  2019,  the  DOS  ordered  the  departure  of  non-emergency  U.S.
Government  employees  from  the  U.S.  Embassy  in  Baghdad  because  of  heightened
tension with Iran. On September 24, 2019, the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad again reported
heightened tensions, noting that attacks in major cities may occur without warning and
reiterating the DOS guidance to not travel to Iraq.
Beginning in early October 2019, the country experienced large-scale protests in
Baghdad and several Shia-majority governorates. Demonstrators gathered in the streets
to reinforce their demands for an end to corruption and a restructuring of the government.
Civilian  authorities  quickly  lost  control  of  the  situation.  Security  and  armed  groups,
including Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), responded with live ammunition, tear gas
canisters  shot  as  projectiles,  and  concussion  grenades,  in  an  attempt  to  suppress  the
demonstrations. By official accounts, as of December 17, 2019, more than 479 civilians
were killed and at least 20,000 were injured.
On  December  27,  2019,  a  rocket  attack  on  a  base  near  Kirkuk  in  northern  Iraq
killed a U.S. contractor and wounded four U.S. and two Iraqi servicemembers. Two days
later, the United States launched retaliatory airstrikes on five facilities (three in Iraq) used
by the Iran-backed Iraqi armed group Kata’ib Hezbollah (KH), to which the United States
attributed the December 27 attack and other attacks. On December 31, 2019, supporters
of  KH  and  other  Iran-backed  Iraqi  militias  surrounded  the  U.S.  Embassy  in  Baghdad,
forcing their way into the compound and setting some outer buildings on fire. Iraqi officials
and security forces reestablished order outside the embassy, but tensions remained high,
with KH supporters and other pro-Iran figures threatening further action and vowing to
expel the United States from Iraq by force if necessary.
On  January  2,  2020,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Defense  announced  that  the  U.S.
military  had  killed  the  Islamic  Revolutionary  Guards  Corps-Qods  Force  (IRGC-QF)
Commander, Major General Qasem Soleimani, in a defensive action. The statement cited
Soleimani’s  responsibility  for  the  deaths  of  hundreds  of  Americans  and  coalition
servicemembers and his approval of the  embassy blockade in Baghdad, and asserted
that he was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and servicemembers
in  Iraq  and  throughout  the  region.  According  to  subsequent  media  reports  and  United
States  statements,  Soleimani  was  killed  in  a  U.S.  drone  strike  while  leaving  Baghdad
International Airport early on the morning of January 3, 2020. In response, Prime Minister
Adel Abd al Mahdi and President Barham Salih condemned the strike as a violation of
lraqi  sovereignty.  On  January  3,  2020,  the  U.S.  Embassy  issued  an  alert  that  cited
heightened tensions in Iraq and the region and urged American citizens to depart Iraq
immediately.  On  March  26,  2020,  due  to  a  combination  of  security  conditions  and
restricted travel options as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the DOS ordered
the  departure  of  designated  U.S.  Government  employees  at  the  U.S.  Embassy  in
Baghdad and associated offices elsewhere in Iraq.
The  Islamic  State  in  Iraq  and  Syria  (ISIS)  is  a  designated  terrorist  organization
conducting an active insurgency in Syria, with direct links to terrorist groups in Iraq and
other parts of the world. It commits terrorist attacks, violent atrocities, and targets U.S.
citizens. The Iraqi government declared all of its territory liberated from ISIS in December
2017;  however,  despite  improved  government  control,  ISIS  remains  a  threat  to  public
safety in Iraq through the indiscriminate use of terrorist and asymmetrical attacks.
In  January  2019,  the  U.S.  Director  of  National  Intelligence  (DNI),  delivered  the
Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community. In his Statement for
the Record, the DNI provided the following assessment of the situation in Iraq: ISIS still
commands thousands of fighters in Iraq and Syria, and it maintains eight branches, more
than a dozen networks, and thousands of dispersed supporters around the world, despite
significant leadership and territorial losses. ISIS very likely will continue to pursue external
attacks  from  Iraq  and  Syria  against  regional  and  Western  adversaries,  including  the
United  States.  In  Iraq,  Iran-supported  Popular  Mobilization  Committee  (PMF)-affiliated
Shia militias remain the primary threat to U.S. personnel, and the DNI expected that threat
to increase as the threat ISIS poses to the militias recedes, Iraqi Government formation
concludes, some Iran-backed groups call for the United States to withdraw, and tension
between Iran and the United States grows. The DNI continued to watch for signs that the
Iranian regime might direct its proxies and partners in Iraq to attack US interests. Iraq is
facing an increasingly disenchanted public. The underlying political and economic factors
10
that facilitated the rise of ISIS persist, and Iraqi Shia militias’ attempts to further entrench
their role in the state increase the threat to US personnel. Iraqi Shia militants conducted
several attacks against US diplomatic facilities in Iraq in September and December 2018.
There is a serious risk from terrorism in Baghdad and Basra. ISIS fighters have
gone underground and formed cells that still pose a danger throughout Iraq. These cells
will continue with their attempts to carry out high-profile attacks on Iraqi Security Force
personnel, government installations, and other soft targets in major population centers.
Iranian-backed  Shia  militias  have  previously  targeted  U.S.  interests  in  Iraq.  There  are
reports  of  Shia  militia  groups  kidnapping  locals,  foreign  workers,  and  members  of
international  organizations  and  demanding  ransoms  from  either  their  families  or  their
employers. A number of militia groups remain hostile to U.S. interests and continue to
pose a considerable potential threat, as either organized groups or individually as rogue
elements that may take independent action.
According  to  the  United  Nations,  ISIS  has  killed  more  than  3,000  civilians  and
injured more than 4,600 people since 2017. In its 2019 Human Rights Report, the U.S.
DOS noted that Iraq’s most significant human rights issues included: reports of unlawful
or  arbitrary  killings,  including  extra-judicial  killings;  forced  disappearances;  torture;
arbitrary  detention;  harsh  and  life-threatening  prison  and  detention  center  conditions;
arbitrary  or  unlawful  interference  with  privacy;  the  worst  forms  of  restrictions  on  free
expression, the press, and the internet, including violence against journalists, censorship,
site  blocking,  and  criminal  libel;  significant  interference  with  the  rights  of  peaceful
assembly;  legal  restrictions  on  freedom  of  movement  of  women;  threats  of  violence
against internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnee populations perceived to have
been affiliated with ISIS; and widespread official corruption.
Iraq’s  government,  including  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister,  investigated
allegations of abuses and atrocities perpetrated by the Iraqi Security Forces, including an
investigation  of  the  October  protests,  but  the  Iraqi  government  rarely  punished  those
responsible  for  perpetrating  or  authorizing  human  rights  abuses.  Moreover,  despite  a
reduction in numbers, ISIS continued to commit serious abuses and atrocities, including
killings  through  suicide  bombings  and  IEDs.  Some  allegations  of  ISIS  abuses  and
atrocities  were  prosecuted,  including  suspected  ISIS  members  under  the  2005
counterterrorism law.
The 2015 Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Protection Act
of 2015 makes citizens of lraq ineligible to travel or be admitted to the United States under
the Visa Waiver Program. This exclusion reflects the determination of the Secretary of
Homeland Security that Iraqi citizens are more likely to be a credible threat to the national
security  of the  United  States;  and  that  a foreign terrorist  organization has a significant
presence in Iraq; or that Iraq is a safe haven for terrorists.
The U.S. Mission in Iraq is dedicated to our enduring strategic partnership with the
Government  of  Iraq  and  the  Iraqi  people.  In  coordination  with  the  Global  Coalition  to
Defeat  ISIS,  the  United  States  assisted  Iraq’s  efforts  to  achieve  the  December  2017
milestone of liberating the country from ISIS. Following the territorial defeat of ISIS in Iraq,
11
the  United   States  increased  efforts  to  stabilize   liberated  areas  as  Iraq   continues  to
develop as a sovereign, stable, and self-reliant country. Iraq is  now  a key partner  for the
United States in  the  region  as well as a  voice  of  moderation and  democracy in  the Middle
East.   Iraq   benefits  from  functioning  government  institutions,  including   an  active
legislature, and  plays an increasingly constructive  role in  the region. The  United States
maintains vigorous and  broad engagement  with Iraq on diplomatic, political, economic,
and   security  issues  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.-Iraq  Strategic  Framework  Agreement
(SFA).  The  SFA  between Iraq and  the United States provides the foundation for  the U.S.-
Iraq  bilateral   relationship.  Covering  a  wide  range  of  bilateral   issues,   including  political
relations and diplomacy, defense and  security, trade  and  finance, energy, judicial and law
enforcement
it
emphasizes the  important relationship and  common goals the  two  countries share. Efforts
to implement the SFA  are overseen by the Higher Coordinating Committee and several
Joint Coordination Committees.
issues,  services,  science,  culture,  education,   and   environment,
U.S.  bilateral   assistance   to  Iraq  focuses  on  economic  reform,  assistance  to
vulnerable  groups,  and   democracy  and   governance.  The   U.S.  continues   to  help
strengthen the capacity of Iraq’s civil society  organizations and  elected representatives.
U.S. bilateral  assistance  aims not  only to  bolster  Iraq’s democratic institutions,  but  also to
preserve the strategic, political, and  economic importance of  the U.S.-Iraq  partnership in
a changing  Middle East  region. Since 2014, the United States has contributed  billions of
dollars in  humanitarian,  demining, and  stabilization aid  to conflict-affected and displaced
Iraqis in the region, including support for communities recovering from genocide.
Jordan
The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Jordan) is a constitutional monarchy ruled by
King Abdullah II bin Hussein. In 2013 and 2014, the U.S. provided Jordan $2.25 billion in
loan guarantees, allowing Jordan access to affordable financing from international capital
markets. The U.S.-Jordan free trade agreement (FTA), the U.S.’s first FTA with an Arab
country, has expanded the trade relationship by reducing barriers for services, providing
cutting-edge  protection  for  intellectual  property,  ensuring  regulatory  transparency,  and
requiring effective labor and environmental enforcement. The United States and Jordan
have an “open skies” civil aviation agreement; a bilateral investment treaty; a science and
technology  cooperation  agreement;  and  a  memorandum  of  understanding  on  nuclear
energy cooperation. Such agreements bolster efforts to help diversify Jordan’s economy
and  promote  growth.  Jordan  and  the  United  States  belong  to  a  number  of  the  same
international  organizations,  including  the  United  Nations,  International  Monetary  Fund,
World Bank, and World Trade Organization. Jordan also is a Partner for Cooperation with
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
The U.S. DOS assesses the threat of terrorism in Jordan as high; with the capital
of Amman currently assessed as a high-threat location for terrorist activity directed at or
affecting  official  U.S.  Government  interests.  Transnational  and  indigenous  terrorist
groups in Jordan have demonstrated the capability to plan and implement attacks. Violent
extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, including the Islamic State of lraq and the Levant (ISIL)
(also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS) and Jabhat al-Nusra, have
conducted attacks in Jordan and continue to plot against local security forces, U.S. and
Western interests, and soft targets such as high-profile public events, hotels, places of
worship, restaurants, schools, and malls. Jordan’s prominent role in the effort to defeat
ISIS, and its shared borders with Iraq and Syria, increase the potential for future terrorist
incidents.
Although  Jordan  remained  a  committed  partner  on  counterterrorism  and
countering  violent  extremism  in  2016,  numerous  terrorist  incidents  reflect  the  current
security situation in Jordan: throughout 2017, multiple vehicle-borne improvised explosive
devices detonated in and around a refugee camp in Syria near the Jordanian border; and
in October 2017, two homemade explosive devices were found in another refugee camp
in Jordan. Also in October 2017, the State Security Court (SSC) prosecuted six people
for sympathizing with ISIS, after they created social media accounts to recruit Jordanian
supporters for ISIS and promoted terrorist activity. In September 2017, the SSC charged
16 people with a terrorist plot involving the use of automatic weapons to carry out terrorist
attacks  against  public  security  services;  and  the  Jordanian  General  Intelligence
Directorate arrested a 10-person ISIS cell that was planning to attack security forces and
tourist  locations using  explosive suicide belts.  Throughout  2017, there  were numerous
instances of extremists posting pro-ISIS videos or statements on social media.
U.S. involvement in  Iraq  and  Syria  and the U.S. Government’s policies on Israel,
have  fueled anti-American feelings in  Jordan. Recent surveys reflect that over 80%  of  the
Jordanian population has an unfavorable view  of the U.S. Government. The  U.S. DOS
has assessed  Amman as being a  high-threat  location for  political  violence directed at  or
affecting official  U.S. Government interests. In December 2017, protests took place at the
U.S.  Embassy  for   27 days  after  the  announcement  that  the  U.S.  Embassy  in  Tel   Aviv
would move to Jerusalem.
As  a  regional  leader  in   the  Global   Coalition  to  Defeat  ISIS,  Jordan  played  an
important role  in  Coalition successes in  degrading the terrorist group’s territorial  control
and   operational  reach.  During  2016,  Jordanian  authorities  took  legal   action  against
numerous individuals accused  of  terrorism under Jordanian law. On July 13, 2016, the
Jordanian  State  Security  Court  filed  charges  against  21  suspected  ISIS  affiliates  in
connection  with the pre-emptive March raid on an alleged ISIS safe house in  lrbid. The
DOS  assesses that the potential for terrorist activity is heightened as Jordan participates
in  the coalition against  ISIS. Extremist groups have  carried out terrorist activities against
U.S.  and   Jordanian  government  targets  in  Jordan.   Terrorist  groups  often  do  not
distinguish between U.S. Government personnel and private U.S. citizens, and  may target
areas  frequented  by  Westerners,  such   as  tourist  sites,  hotels,   restaurants,  shopping
malls, and transportation hubs.
According  to  the  DOS  2017  Human  Rights  Report,  Jordan’s  most  significant
continuing  human  rights  problems  include  allegations  of  torture  by  security  and
government officials; arbitrary arrest and detention, including of activists and journalists;
infringements on privacy rights; restrictions on freedom of expression; and restrictions on
freedom  of  association  and  assembly.  Impunity  remained  widespread,  and  the
13
government  did  not  take  sufficiently  strong  steps  to  investigate,  prosecute,  or  punish
officials who committed abuses.
The Jordanian SSC took legal action against numerous individuals deemed to be
terrorists under local law, including the arrest and prosecution of men accused of seeking
to  join  Al-Nusra  Front  (ANF)  and  ISIS.  Other  arrests  and  prosecutions  involved
supporting/recruiting for ISIS and attempted travel to/from Syria in  support of extremist
activities and also for “propagating ISIL ideology,” a charge often used for online activity.
