Applicant denied all four SOR allegations. After a thorough  and  careful review  of
the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  47-year-old  employee  of   a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  page  5.)
He   has  been  employed  with  the   defense  contractor   since   2019.  He   does  not   hold   a
security  clearance.  (TR at page 26 lines 7~21.)  He  is married  to  a U.S.  citizen, and  has
one  child, age  nine. (TR at page  24 line 22 to page 25 line 12, and at page 29 line 23 to
page 30 line 4.)
Applicant left  Iran in  1994. (TR at page 13 lines 11~14.)  He  first went to Turkey,
then  to  Germany,  and  finally  to   the  United   States  in   2003.  (TR  at  page  16   line  19  to
page  17   line  18.)  He   later   received   a  bachelor’s  degree  from  an  American  university.
(TR  at   page  17  lines  14~21.)   He   is  a   Christian;  and   as  such,   was  treated  like  a  “third
class citizen” in Iran. (TR at page 14 line 6 to page 15 line 4.)
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a.  Applicant’s  mother  is  a  citizen   and   resident  of  Iran.  She  is  “a  housewife.”
Applicant  contacts  her  a  couple   of  times  a  year,  the  last  time  being  seven  to  eight
months prior to his hearing. (TR at page 21 line 23 to page 22 line 13.)
1.b. Applicant’s father is a citizen and  resident  of Iran. He  is a retired legal clerk.
Applicant has little  contact with his father, the last time  being three to  four years prior  to
his hearing. (TR at page 20 line  19 to page 21 line 22.)
1.c.   Applicant’s  brother  is  a  citizen  and   resident  of  Iran.  “He  works  in   a  bank.”
Applicant has little  contact with his brother,  the last time being about two years prior to
his hearing. (TR at page 18 line  1 to page 19 line 4.)
1.d. Applicant’s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and  residents of Iran.
She  “used   to  work”   in   the  field   of  agriculture,  and   he  is  retired  from  a  company  that
made cement.  Applicant  has not contacted his in-laws in  four or five years. (TR at page
23 line 6 to page 24 line 21.)
Notice
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  following:  Iran  is  an  authoritarian  theocratic
republic  with  a  Shia  Islamic  political  system.  Iran  has  been  designated  as  a  State
Sponsor  of  Terrorism  since  1984.  In  the  past,  the  Iranian  government  has  spent  as
much  as  $700  million  per  year  to  support  terrorist  groups.  Subject  to  certain  limited
exceptions, citizens of Iran are currently barred from entry into the United States.
