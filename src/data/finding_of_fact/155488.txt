Note:  In describing Applicant’s employment history, I use the phrases “diplomatic
post”  and   “diplomatic   facility”   (DF)   so  as   not   to   specifically  identify  them   more  than
necessary,  as  this  decision  is  to  be  posted  publically  on  the  DOHA   website.   (Tr.  122-
123) The facilities are identified in the record.
Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.e)  and  included  a
narrative  statement  with  her  Answer.  (Answer  Encl.  3)  Her  admissions  and  other
comments are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 42 years old. She was born and raised in Thailand. She earned her
bachelor’s degree in 2000 from a Thai university. She then came to the United States to
further  her  education.  She  studied  for  two  years  at  a  state  university  in  the  United
States, earning a master’s degree in May 2003. (GE 1; AE A; Tr. 22, 70, 74-75).
From  November  2003  to  January  2009,  Applicant  worked  at  a  Thai  diplomatic
facility (Thai DF 1) in the United States. She worked in consular affairs and then as an
assistant  to  a  senior  Thai  diplomat.  (GE  1;  Tr.  22,  32,  83-84)(SOR  ¶  1.e)  She  is  no
longer in touch with anyone she worked with there. (Tr. 84, 96-97)
Applicant  then  returned  to  Thailand.  After  a  brief  period  of  unemployment,  she
began working in August 2009 as a local employee at a U.S. diplomatic post in Thailand
as  an  immigrant  visa  assistant.  (GE  1;  Tr.  22-23,  33,  71)  She  testified  that  the  work
involved “very sensitive” personal information and she knew not to discuss it. (Tr. 72)
Applicant  remained  in  that  job  until  February  2012,  when  she  moved  to  the
United  States  to  marry  her  husband.  They  met  in  2010  when  he  was  a  U.S.  Foreign
Service officer serving in Thailand. They married in February 2012. They have lived in
the  United  States  ever  since,  with  her  husband’s  three  children  from  a  prior  marriage.
(GE 1; Tr. 74; AE E-F)
After immigrating to the United States, Applicant was unemployed while awaiting
a green card (November 2012) and work visa (November 2013, est.). She then worked
as  an  assistant  at  another  Thai  diplomatic  facility  in  the  United  States.  (Thai  DF  2).
Applicant  testified  that  she  was  considered  a  “local  employee,”  and  was  not  an
employee of the Thai Foreign Service. (Tr. 34-36) She was involved in visa applications
and protocol. (GE 1; Tr. 83-85, 102-103) She said she applied for the job because she
thought  she  might  get  hired  due  to  her  prior  work  at  Thai  DF  1.  (Tr.  100-101)  She
worked there from November 2013 to January 2018. (SOR ¶ 1.e)
Applicant  became  a  U.S.  citizen   in  July  2016.  (GE   1;   Tr.   73)   She  holds  a  valid
U.S. passport, issued a month later.  Since then, she has only used a U.S. passport  to
travel.  (Tr. 76)  Her Thai  passport  expired in  2019. (GE  1) She accepts no benefits from
being a Thai citizen and has no plans to return to Thailand permanently. (Tr. 76)
Applicant submitted her SCA in November 2017, in connection with a job offer for
a  cleared  position  with  a  State  Department  contractor.  She  worked  in  a  passport
issuance office at the State Department for about 18 months until her interim clearance
was  withdrawn  (likely  due  to  the  SOR).  Applicant  described  herself  as  a  hard  worker.
She  never  discusses  the  sensitive  or  classified  information  she  handled.  She  remains
sponsored for the position. (GE 1; Tr. 37-38, 70-71, 89-90, 107)
Applicant  also  testified  that  her  earlier  job  as  a  local  employee  at  the  U.S.
diplomatic post in Thailand required a background check. She was also briefed on what
to do if she was approached by someone outside the facility, and she was to report any
such contacts to the diplomatic security office. (Tr. 118-121)
Applicant’s  parents are citizens and  residents of Thailand. (SOR ¶  1.a) Her father
is  89   and   has  been  retired  for   many  years.  Applicant’s  mother   is  75.  She  worked  for
many years as a secretary for a car dealer.  Her longtime boss is elderly and retired, and
Applicant’s   mother  is   his  caregiver   and   financial  manager.  (Tr.  77-78)  Applicant   has
regular phone  calls  with  her parents and  frequent text  messages  with her  mother. (Tr.
23-24, 78)  Her conversations with her father are  brief because he is in  mental decline.
Her parents do  not  really know  or understand what Applicant  does for a  living. (Tr. 78-
80) Applicant and her husband do not provide her parents financial support. (Tr. 78, 92)
Applicant’s  two  brothers  also  remain  in  Thailand.  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  One  brother  is  a
former professor. He owns a small resort. They are in contact several times a year. The
other brother is unemployed. Applicant has little contact with him. They are not aware of
what she does for a living. (Tr. 80-82, 101) Applicant has returned to Thailand for family
visits five times since 2012, most recently in 2019. (Tr. 76, 92-96)
SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  that  Applicant  maintains  contact  with  “friends  and  former
coworkers who are citizens and residents of Thailand.” This includes former co-workers
at the U.S. diplomatic facility in Thailand, whom she sees on return visits there. (Tr. 27,
38-42) She is friends with one local person in the United States. that she worked with at
Thai DF 2. They share an interest in food and do not discuss work or politics. (Tr.  38,
82-83, 85, 98, 105-106) She remains friends with one Thai diplomat she knew from that
job,  a  person  who  is  now  posted  overseas.  They  are  in  regular,  frequent  contact.  (Tr.
104-105) Applicant maintains no other regular, ongoing contact with any Thai diplomats
she has worked with in the past. (Tr. 96-100, 105-106)
Applicant  testified,  “The  U.S.  is  my  home.  I  love  this  country.  And  my  family  is
here.  In  total,  I  have  lived  here  for  17  years  of  my  life.  And  the  day  I  became  a  U.S.
citizen was one of the proudest days of my life.” (Tr. 85, 91) Her dream job is to work for
the U.S. Government. (Tr. 85-86) She has not voted in Thailand since becoming a U.S.
citizen. (Tr. 86) Applicant testified that she would report to authorities if she were ever
approached for information. (Tr. 87)
Applicant’s  husband  testified  as  a  character  witness.  They  met  in  early  2010
when  he  was  posted  to  Thailand  as  a  cleared  U.S.  Foreign  Service  officer,  while  on
sabbatical from law practice. They did not work together but he was aware of her duties.
(Tr. 17-18) He returned to the United States later that year. They kept in touch and their
romance  blossomed.  Applicant  came  to  the  United  States  on  a  fiancée  visa  (K-1)  in
February 2012, and they married soon after. (Tr. 19-21, 31; AE D)
Applicant’s husband is now counsel at a large law firm. (Tr. 27-28) Applicant is a
loving  and  caring  stepmother  to  his  three  teenage  children.  (Tr.  21,  30,  74;  AE  E)  He
and Applicant have significant financial assets in the United States, including their home
and  his  private  practice  income.  (Tr.  24-25,  86-88,  108;  AE  F)  Applicant  has  many
friends in the United States and in her local community. (Tr. 24, 88)
Applicant’s  husband  testified  that  the  day  Applicant  became  a  U.S.  citizen  was
one of the proudest days of her life, as well as his own. He also noted her pride and joy
in  voting  in  the  United  States  for  the  first  time.  He  said  she  is  a  proud  and  loyal  U.S.
citizen.  (Tr. 25-26)
Three other character witnesses (W1, W2, W3) testified by phone. W1 is a reti
red
U.S. Foreign Service  officer who retired to  Thailand. He  met  and  hired Applicant at the
U.S. diplomatic post  there and  was one  of  her  supervisors.  He  noted that consular and
visa  work  involves  sensitive   and  personal   information,   including  medical   information.
Applicant  was  very  reliable  in   handling  that  information.  He   trusted  her  judgment  and
discretion,  and   said   she  was  very  dedicated  to  her  job.  He   is  aware  of  her  prior  and
subsequent  work  at  the  Thai  DFs  in   the  U.S.  He   also  noted  that  many  Thai  citizens
have   married  U.S.  diplomats  and  become  U.S.  citizens   as  well  as  cleared  State
Department employees to do consular and visa work. (Tr. 45-51; AE D)
An example of such a person is W2. She was born in Thailand. She came to the
United  States  in  2000  and  has been  a  U.S.  citizen  since  2003.  She  has  been  a  State
Department employee since 2004. She works in human resources and has a clearance.
She  met  Applicant’s  husband  when  they  were  both  posted  to  Thailand,  and  met
Applicant in 2018. She and Applicant are close friends and socialized often (before the
pandemic).  W2  described  Applicant  as  a  “rule  follower,”  (Tr.  55-56)  and  a  loyal  U.S.
citizen who is worthy of holding a clearance. (Tr. 53-60; AE D)
W3  is  a  cleared  State  Department  contractor.  He  met  Applicant  when  they
worked  in  the  same  office,  in  about  2018.  They  bonded  because  W3  had  travelled  to
Thailand.  They  would  socialize  in  the  same  group  of  friends  at  work.  He  described
Applicant as dedicated, honest, hardworking, punctual, and “above average” in terms of
clearance suitability.  (Tr. 62-68)
I also considered the reference letters of the character witnesses who testified at
the hearing, as well as the letters from those who did not. They all offered similar, and
strong,  endorsements  of  Applicant’s  character,  value  to  the  United  States,  judgment,
trustworthiness, reliability, and overall suitability to hold a clearance. (AE D)
Kingdom of Thailand (Thailand)(AN I)
Thailand is a constitutional monarchy, with the king as head of state. King Rama
X was crowned in 2019, three years after the death of his father, who ruled for 70 years,
from 1946 until 2016. Thailand is also a parliamentary democracy, with a prime minister
as head of government.
From  May  2014  to  July  2019,  Thailand  was  governed  by  a  military  junta,  the
National Council for Peace and Order. Following the coup, the United States suspended
military  aid  to  Thailand.  This  period  saw  increased  cooperation  between  Thailand  and
the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and complicated U.S.-Thai relations.
Thailand has extensive trade and investment relations across the pacific region.
Historically, Thailand has close ties with the PRC, and trade has burgeoned under the
2010  China-ASEAN  Free  Trade  Agreement.  Unlike  several  of  its  neighbors,  Thailand
has no territorial disputes with the PRC in the South China Sea and has been loath to
take  an assertive stance against  China's actions there.  As a member  of the China-led
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Thailand is involved in a high-speed railway project that
would connect southern China with several Southeast Asian nations.
Following democratic elections in Thailand in 2019, U.S. military assistance has
resumed,  and  military  cooperation  has  increased.  The  2020  Cobra  Gold  military
exercise was the largest ever of that annual event.
Thailand has indicated it wants to reset its relationship with the United States.  As
one  of  Southeast  Asia's  most  developed  nations  and  a  long-time  U.S.  partner  on  a
range  of  issues,  Thailand  has  the  potential  to  support  U.S.  initiatives  such  as
broadening regional defense cooperation. However, U.S. policymakers face challenges
in  rekindling  the  relationship  while  encouraging  Thailand  to  fully  return  to  democratic
norms. Among U.S. concerns are the Thai government's continued efforts to suppress
criticism,  including  muzzling  journalists  and  banning  one  of  the  largest  opposition
parties, as well as other human rights issues.
While  AN  I  details  instances  of  domestic  terrorism,  Thailand  experienced  no
attacks attributed to  transnational  terrorist  groups in 2019,  and violence was  restricted
to  attacks  attributed  to  ethno-nationalist  insurgents  in  the  country's  restive  southern
region.
According to a March 1, 2021 travel advisory, the State Department urges U.S.
citizens to reconsider travel to Thailand (Level 3) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The
same advisory notes that Thai borders currently remain closed for all foreign nationals,
with few exceptions.
