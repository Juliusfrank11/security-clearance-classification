Applicant  is  47  years  old,  and  divorced.  She  has  two  children.  She  has  a
Master’s  degree.  She  holds  the  position  of  Site  Operations  Manager  for  a  defense
contractor.  She  is  seeking  to  retain  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  her
employment.
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because she
made  financial  decisions  that  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or  an
unwillingness  to  abide  by rules and regulations,  all of  which raise  questions  about  her
reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.
The  SOR  identified  sixteen  delinquent  debts  held  by  private  creditors  totaling
approximately $76,000, showing a history of financial problems.  Applicant also received
a written warning from her employer for misuse of her corporate credit card.  Applicant
admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline except 1.d., 1.h.,
1.i.,  1.j.,  and  1.q.  Credit  reports  of  the  Applicant  dated  February  3,  2018;  June  14,
2019;  and September  21,  2020, confirm  the outstanding debts.  (Government  Exhibits
6, 7 and 8.)  Applicant began working for her current employer in 1997.  She has held a
security clearance for the past twenty-three years.  She has never committed a security
violation or infraction.  She states that she has completed all required security training
and complied with all procedures for safeguarding classified material.
Applicant  was  married  to  her  first  husband  from  1998  until  2011,  when  they
divorced.  During the marriage, he was a stay-at-home Dad, taking care of the children,
and she was the breadwinner, working outside of the home, providing the main financial
support  for  the  family.  Applicant  states  that  in  December  2008  she  and  her  husband
separated,  and  she  became  a  single  parent,  having  sole  responsibility  for  their  two
children.  Following the divorce, in 2011, Applicant was unable to pay the debt because
of  her  other  financial  obligations.  Applicant  stated  that  initially  her  divorce  settlement
required  her  to  pay  her  husband  spousal  support  in  the  amount  of  $1,500  dollars  a
month from April 2011 to March 2016.  He was supposed to pay her $1,250 a month in
child  support  until  the  children  reached  the  age  of  18  or  19.  The  final  version  of  the
divorce  settlement  changed  and  Applicant  was  required  to  pay  her  husband  $250  a
month  for  five  years,  and  he  was  not  required  to  pay  her  child  support.
In  total,
Applicant paid her husband a total of $15,000 in spousal support.  Applicant also paid
credit card charges made by her husband during their period of separation because he
was  an  authorized   user  on  her   account.     All  of  the   expenses  she  incurred  from   the
separation  and   divorce  totaled  about  $100,000,  including  attorney’s  fees,  mediation
costs,  child  care  expenses,  home  maintenance  issues,   and   other  related  matters.
Although  the  divorce   decree  made  her  ex-husband   responsible   for   half  of   their  credit
card debt,  she was concerned  that he may  not pay his half, (which he did not do),  and
so she tried to continue making payments on  all of the debts until  it became impossible.
This exhausted all of the Applicant’s  financial resources.   (Applicant’s Response to the
FORM.)
Concerned  about  her  financial  situation  and  her  excessive  delinquent  debt,
Applicant  sought  out  legal  advice  from  an  attorney  regarding  payment  of  her  debt.
Applicant was advised not to contact her creditors regarding her debt since it was about
to drop off of her credit reports, because there has been no account activity for seven
years, the debts were no longer enforceable, and they would cease to affect her credit
score.  She  relied  on  this  advice,  until  she  received  the  SOR,  and  then  contacted  a
security  clearance  consultant  for  help.  Upon  receipt  of  the  SOR,  on  November  22,
2019, Applicant took out a loan for $30,000 that she is repaying in the amount of $934
monthly for three years.  She is using the money from the loan to pay off her delinquent
creditors.  (Applicant’s Response to the FORM.)
1.a.  For a two-year period from 2015 through 2017, Applicant used her company
credit card for personal use.  She explained that because of her poor credit rating she
was  unable  to  get  her  own  personal  credit  card.  She  states  that  she  always  made
timely  payments  as  required  on  the  company  credit  card  and  she  only  sought
reimbursement for company and work-related expenses that she charged on the card.
This activity was discovered during an audit of her company credit card account.  As a
result, Applicant received a written reprimand from her supervisor.  She states that she
accepts full responsibility  for this rule violation.  She  states  that she  was  motivated by
the convenience of using a credit card rather than writing checks or paying with cash for
personal  expenses.  She  realizes  that  using  her  company  credit  card  was  a  bad
decision, and she states that she will never repeat it.  Despite the written reprimand she
received from her supervisor for misuse of her company credit card in November 2017,
Applicant  was  rated  as  an  “Excellent  Performer”  that  year  by  her  supervisor.
(Applicant’s Response to the FORM.)
