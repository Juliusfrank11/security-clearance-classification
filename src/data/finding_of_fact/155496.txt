The SOR alleged that Applicant had eleven past-due or charged-off student loans,
totaling $84,005. Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR.
Applicant used a combination of student loans and credit-card debt to pay his way
through school. After school Applicant went through a long period of under-employment
and unemployment before obtaining his current position three years ago. During the past
three years he had been saving money to pay off his large credit-card debt, and has done
so. This is supported by the two most recent credit reports in the record, submitted by the
Government. He then continued saving money and negotiated payoffs with several of the
student-loan creditors. He has substantially reduced his indebtedness, and has a plan in
place  to  resolve  all  of  his  remaining  student  loans  in  the  near  future.  (Tr.  69-75;
Government Exhibits 5 and 6; Applicant Exhibit G.)
Using the Government exhibits he obtained at the hearing, particularly the credit
reports, Applicant was able to provide an extended analysis of his student loan debts.
This analysis, found at Applicant Exhibit G, discusses all the debts listed in the SOR. (Tr.
