Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  54-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with a defense contractor since 1989. He has held a security clearance since
1989. (TR at page 15 line 22 to page 17 line 18, and GX 2 at page 7.)  He is married,
and  has  two  adult  children.  (TR  at  page  15  line  22  to  page  17  line  18,  and  GX  2  at
pages 15, 17 and 18.)
Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption
Applicant  began  drinking  alcohol  at  about  15  years  of  age,  and   started  having
“drinking problems”  at the age  of 18. (TR at page 17 line 20 to page 18 line 13.)  His first
Driving Under the Influence  of Alcohol  (DUI)  incident occurred about 1988. This incident
was not alleged in  the  SOR. Applicant considers himself to be an alcoholic. (TR at page
17 line 20 to page 19 line 14.)
1.d.  Applicant’s  second  alcohol-related  incident  occurred  in  February  of  2008,
when he was charged with and pled guilty to DUI. (TR at page 19 line 15 to page 25 line
13.) He received treatment, was diagnosed as suffering from an Alcohol Use Disorder,
and attended Alcoholics Anonymous for two years. (Id., and TR at page 27 lines 3~8.)
1.a. After about eight years of sobriety, Applicant returned to the consumption of
alcohol;  and  as  a  result,  received  out-patient  treatment  for  his  Alcohol  Use  Disorder
from about February 2017 to about August 2017. (TR at page 25 line 20 to page 28 line
7, and at page 30 lines 2~8.)
1.b. After a “few months” of sobriety, Applicant again returned to the consumption
of  alcohol;  and  as  a  result,  received  in-patient  treatment  for  Alcohol  Use  Disorder,
Severe from about January of 2018 to about May 2018. (TR at page 28 line 10 to page
32 line 7.)
1.c.  Despite the above mentioned in-patient and out-patient treatments, Applicant
returned  to  the  consumption  of  alcohol.  (TR  at  page  32  line  8  to  page  35  line  5.)  He
avers  that  he  has  abstained  from  its  consumption  since  October  of  2018,  about  two
years prior to his hearing. (Id.)
Guideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
2.a.  and   2.b.  Applicant  used  marijuana  on  numerous  occasions  from  1981  until
about January of 2018. (TR at page 35 line 10 to page 36 line 14.) Most of his usage
was  prior  to  his  being  granted  a  security  clearance,  but  Applicant  did  use  the  illegal
substance “a couple of times”  while holding a security clearance. (TR at page 17 lines
9~14, at page 37 line 8 to page 38 line 18, and at page 42 lines 6~25.)
Guideline E, Personal Conduct
3.a.  and   3.b.  In  answer  to  Section  23  on  his  October  5,  2017,  SCA,  Applicant
failed  to  disclose  his  marijuana  usage.  During  his   subsequent  subject  interview
conducted   under  oath  on  January  17,  2019,  Applicant  continued  to  conceal  his
marijuana usage. (TR at  page 38 line 19 to page 39 line 11, and  GX 2 at  pages 29~30.)
This lack of candor constitutes willful falsifications.
