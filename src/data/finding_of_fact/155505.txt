Applicant’s  SOR response   admitted all of the SOR allegations, and  he provided
some  extenuating   and  mitigating  information.   His   admissions   are   accepted  as  factual
findings.
Background Information
Applicant is a 25-year-old electronics engineer, who has been employed full-time
by a defense contractor since October 2017. Before becoming a full-time employee, he
was  employed  as  a college  intern  by that defense contractor  in the summers  of 2015,
2016, and 2017. (Tr. 14-15, 57, 61-62; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  June  2013.  He  did  not  complete  his
college  requirements  until  October  2017,  and  was  awarded  a  bachelor  of  science
degree  in  physics  in  December  2017.  (Tr.  15-16;  GE  1)  Applicant  has  never  married
and has no dependents. (Tr. 16-17) He has held a Secret security clearance since July
2015,  and  has  a  pending  application  to  upgrade  his  clearance  to  Top  Secret.
Maintaining a clearance is a requirement of his continued employment. (Tr. 17-18, 56)
Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse
In his June 15, 2015 SF-86, Applicant disclosed his marijuana use that spanned
a period of time from May 2010 to December 2013. He was introduced to marijuana as
a freshman on the high school baseball team, having smoked marijuana about 25 times
during  his  high  school  years,  and  “completely  stopped”  in  his  senior  year.  He  used
marijuana again as a freshman in college “about 3 times.” Applicant added in that same
SF-86:
I  have   not  done  any   drugs  since  my  first  semester,  freshman   year,  in
college.  .  .  .  I  have   done  an  incredible   amount  of  growing  since   then,  in
high school,  I stopped spending time with the crowd that I smoked with.  . .
.  the  “benefits”   of   doing  any  drug  is  in   no  way  even  close  to  the  level  of
satisfaction that I get from doing my job here at [defense contractor]  and
the  possible  benefits  that  would  come  later   with  a  security  clearance.  To
jeopardize  my  future  in   this  industry  (and  everything  that  I  have   worked
for) for  a couple  of hours of “being high is an idiotic choice that I will never
make. I will never use this drug,  nor any  other drug in the  future. (GE 2; Tr.
57-60, 74-76)
At  the  time  Applicant  completed  his  June  15,  2015  SF-86,  he  did  not  have  a
security  clearance.  However,  he  was  subsequently  granted  access  to  classified
information with a Secret security clearance in July 2015. (SOR; Tr. 60) Applicant took
and passed a drug test when he began working in June 2015. (Tr. 60)
In  his  June  11,  2018  SF-86,  which  Applicant  completed  when  he  sought  to
upgrade  his  clearance  from  Secret  to  Top  Secret,  he  disclosed  additional  drug  use.  It
was these disclosures that formed the basis for the majority of security concerns alleged
in  Applicant’s  SOR.  He  admitted  using marijuana  intermittently  from  May  2010 to  May
2018 “around a hundred” times, which included his admitted marijuana use in his June
15, 2015 SF-86. Additionally, he admitted using cocaine from April 2016 to March 2017
five  to  six  times;  using  MDMA  from  December  2016  to  April  2018  six  times;  using
lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in August 2017 one time; using prescription medication
Hydrocodone  without  a  prescription  in  March  2017  three  times;  and  using  prescription
medication Adderall without a prescription from April 2017 to April 2018 four times. As
noted,  Applicant  previously  admitted  using  marijuana;  however,  he  continued  using
marijuana  after  being  granted  access  to  classified  information  in  July  2015  as  well
cocaine,  Ecstasy  or  MDMA,  LSD,  prescription  medication  Hydrocodone,  and
prescription medication Adderall. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.f; Tr. 69-70)
Applicant’s admitted drug use in his June 11, 2018 SF-86 is consistent with  his
previous  admitted  drug  use  in  his  June  15,  2015  SF-86,  and  subsequent  drug  use  he
described  in  his  March  12,  2019  Office  of  Personnel  Management  Personal  Subject
Interview (OPM PSI), his SOR Answer; and during his hearing testimony. (GE 2, GE 3;
SOR  Answer;  Tr.  24-48,  60-65,  67-68,  72-73)  Applicant  disclosed  his  drug  use  on  his
June 11, 2018 SF-86 to avoid being “vulnerable for blackmail.” (Tr. 72)
When  queried  by  Department  Counsel  why  he  did  not  cease  drug  use  after
becoming a full-time employee, Applicant stated:
I think I was still  immature. Coming out of college doesn’t just  –  there’s not
just a slick straight graduate and all of a sudden you’re a fully-developed
grown man. There are things that happen  along  the way that shape  your
character.  And unfortunately for  me,  I was somewhat sheltered, so I didn’t
get  to  experience  anything  –   any  real  negative  effects  until   later   on.  And
I’m sorry  that it happened too late,  but up until that point,  that’s –  that’s –  I
didn’t   get  any  experience.  That  was  –   I  formed  that  maturity   in   my  head
later. (Tr. 65-66, 76)
Applicant stated that he stopped using all drugs in May 2018. His marijuana use
up until that point was averaging, “. . . two to three times a week, so it wasn’t irregular
for  me to come home and  smoke on my balcony. And this day was similar  to what I’d
been doing the last year or so. I smoked. And then an hour or so later, I got a phone call
from my mom.  I decided  I didn’t want to talk to her ‘cause I was  high at the  time. And
just thought, you know, I’ll deal with it tomorrow.” (Tr. 29-31) Applicant’s mother left him
a voice mail telling him that his grandmother was hospitalized and she needed to talk to
him. He later realized other people were counting on him and that he needed to grow up
and  could  not  be  “an  irresponsible  college  kid  anymore.”  (Tr.  31-32,  34,  41,  68-71)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  his  drug  use  was  illegal  and  such  use  was  prohibited
under federal regulations. (Tr. 32-34, 71)
Applicant’s family and friends are aware of his past drug use and are supportive
of him remaining drug-free. He stated that he would remove himself from any situation
where drug use was present. (Tr. 34-35, 50-51) Applicant submitted a signed statement
of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that
any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.
(Tr.  48;  AE  A)  To  demonstrate  his  drug-free  status,  Applicant  submitted  two  negative
hair follicle drug tests dated January 24, 2020 and October 1, 2020, and stated that he
would  be  willing  to  take  random  drug  tests  in  the  future.  (Tr.  48-50;  AE  B,  AE  G)
Applicant has never been arrested, charged, or convicted for a drug-related offense. He
has  not  participated  in  any  voluntary  or  court-ordered  drug  rehabilitation  programs.
Applicant  accepted  responsibility  for  his  past  drug  abuse,  expressed  remorse,  and
stated that he has no desire or intention to use drugs in the future. (Tr. 49, 51-53)
Character Evidence
Applicant  submitted  five  reference  letters  from  a  cross  section  of  individuals  to
include  a  company  senior  manager,  a  company  staff  engineer,  a  coworker,  his  sister,
and  a  long-time  friend.  His  senior  manager  described  his  work  ethic,  integrity,
trustworthiness, and the significant contribution he makes towards the nation’s defense.
Applicant’s  coworker  provided  a  similar  favorable  endorsement.  Applicant’s  sister  and
long-time  friend  provided  favorable  character  assessments  supported  by  accounts  of
their  past  personal  interactions  with  him.  All  five  letters  are  supportive  of  granting
Applicant access to classified information. (AE C, AE H)
Applicant  also  provided  numerous  awards  that  he  received  from  2017  to  2020
and his performance appraisals for 2019, 2018, and 2016 as well as his current resume.
Applicant’s appraisals identify him as a top-shelf performer, who is a valued and trusted
company  employee.  (AE  D,  AE  E;  AE  F)  Applicant  discussed  his  accomplishments,
which  are  further  documented  in  his  performance  appraisals  and  awards.  (Tr.  19-24)
Apart  from  work,  which  lately  has  been  at  home,  he  spends  his  free  time  biking,  rock
climbing, watching sports, and playing video games. Applicant leads a healthy lifestyle
that is not consistent with drug use. (Tr. 54)
