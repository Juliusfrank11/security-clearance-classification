Applicant is 34 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor as a jet
engine  mechanic  since  March  2019.  He  is  engaged  to  the  mother  of  two  of  his  three
children. He has two former wives. Applicant is attending school to obtain a Bachelor of
Arts  degree.  Applicant  is  seeking  to  obtain  national  security  eligibility  and  a  security
clearance in connection with his employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 13A, 17;
Tr. 7-9.)

The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  owed  approximately  $44,633  in  past-due
indebtedness  to  various  creditors.  Applicant  admitted  allegations  1.a,  1.b,  1.c,  1.d,  1.l,
and  1.q.  He  denied  the  remaining  allegations,  stating  those  accounts  were  no  longer
delinquent.  The  existence  and  amount  of  the  debts  is  supported  by  admissions  of
Applicant, and credit reports submitted by the Government dated April 6, 2019; August
19, 2019; and March 17, 2020. (Government Exhibits 2, 4, 5, and 6.)
Applicant has a five-year-old daughter who has severe medical issues. She was
born in April 2015 at 25-and-a-half-weeks gestation and weighing 2.5 pounds. Children
that are born before 28 weeks and under 3.5 pounds are known as a “micro-premie.” The
child  spent  seven  months  in  the  neo-natal  intensive  care  center  at  a  nationally-known
children’s hospital. Applicant  and  his now-fiancée spent almost every waking hour with
their daughter. The medical bills for her care amounted to $3.7 million. Fortunately, most
of  that  was  covered  by  insurance  and  grants.  However,  Applicant  had  to  pay
approximately  $17,000  of  the  medical  debts,  and  has  been  successfully  doing  so.  His
daughter  still  requires  constant  medical  supervision,  as  well  as  speech  therapy  and
physical therapy. Many of Applicant’s financial  issues arose because of his daughter’s
medical condition and the resulting financial decisions he had to make. (Applicant Exhibits
M and DD; Tr. 36-43.)
Applicant  began  his  current  employment  in  March  2019  and  his  income
dramatically increased. Since that time he has been able to begin making payments on
his formerly past-due indebtedness while maintaining his current payments. Applicant’s
current financial condition is stable. (Government Exhibit 3 at 16; Applicant Exhibit A; Tr.
63-64, 66.)
The current status of the debts is as follows:
1.a.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  owed  approximately  $17,624  for  a  charged-off
automobile loan. He was unable to come to an arrangement with the creditor to pay the
debt. The holder of the debt obtained a judgment and has been collecting $376 from each
of Applicant’s paychecks since approximately April 2020.  Applicant had  paid $8,126 of
this debt as of September 20, 2020. This debt is being resolved. (Applicant Exhibit A; Tr.
27-32.)
1.b.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  owed  $13,030  for  a  second  charged-off  vehicle
loan.  He  made  payments  for  several  years  but  fell  behind  because  of  issues  with  his
daughter in 2015. He has not been able to reach a payment agreement with this creditor.
Applicant intends to pay this debt after he pays off his smaller debts, using a technique
called a “debt snowball.” This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 33-35.)
1.c. Applicant admitted that he owed $4,475 for a charged-off loan. This was in
relation  to  his  second  marriage  in  2012.  He  made  payments  for  several  years  but  fell
behind because of the issues with his daughter in 2015. Applicant intends to pay this debt
after he pays off his smaller debts, using a technique called a “debt snowball.” This debt
is not resolved. (Tr. 35-36.)
1.d. Applicant admitted that he owed $2,275 to a wireless telephone company for
a delinquent debt. Applicant testified that he was going to receive a bonus from work soon
after the hearing and would use it to pay off this debt. He made a payment arrangement
with  the  creditor  and  paid this debt  on October  22,  2020,  as shown by documentation
from the creditor. This debt is resolved. (Applicant Exhibit AA; Tr. 43-45, 58-59.)
1.e. Applicant denied that he owed $1,136 for a charged-off debt, stating he had
been  making  agreed  payments.  He  submitted  documentary  evidence  showing  that  he
paid this debt in full in April 2020. It has been resolved. (Government Exhibit 4; Applicant
Exhibit B; Tr. 46-50.)
1.f.  Applicant  denied  that  he  owed  $635  for  a  delinquent  debt  to  a  bank.  He
submitted documentary evidence showing that he paid this debt in full in 2019. It has been
resolved. (Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 51.)
1.g.  Applicant  denied  that  he  owed  $572  for  a  charged-off  debt  owed  to  a
university. He submitted documentary evidence showing that he paid this debt in full in
2018. It has been resolved. (Applicant Exhibit D; Tr. 51.)
1.h. Applicant denied that he owed $542 for a charged-off debt he owed to a bank.
He submitted documentary evidence showing that he paid this debt in full in March 2020.
It has been resolved. (Government Exhibit 4; Applicant Exhibit E; Tr. 46-50.)
1.i. Applicant denied that he owed a credit union $452 for a charged-off debt. He
submitted  documentary  evidence  showing  that  he  paid  this  debt  in  full.  It  has  been
resolved. (Government Exhibit 5 at 10; Applicant Exhibits Z and BB; Tr. 52-55.)
1.j.  Applicant  denied  that  he  owed  $443  for  a  delinquent  debt.  He  submitted

documentary evidence showing that he paid this debt in full in March 2019. It has been
resolved. (Applicant Exhibit G; Tr. 57.)
1.l. Applicant  admitted  owing a delinquent mobile telephone bill in the amount of
$2,293. Applicant  has not paid this debt,  but stated it is next in  line for  payment now  that
the debt set forth in  1.d has been  resolved. This is part of his “debt snowball” plan. (Tr.
57-58.)
1.m.  Applicant  denied  that  he  owed  $315  for  a  delinquent  insurance  debt.  He
submitted  documentary  evidence  showing  that  he  paid  this  debt  in  full.  It  has  been
resolved. (Applicant Exhibit H; Tr. 59.)

1.q. Applicant admitted that he had not filed his 2016 Federal income tax return in
a timely fashion. He testified that he and his now-fiancée had broken up after the birth of
their daughter in 2016. In 2017 he moved and had emotional difficulties because of his
daughter’s fragile health, which impacted his ability to file. Applicant has since filed this
tax return, which indicated he was to receive a refund. He has filed all of his other tax
returns on a timely basis, which is confirmed by IRS documentation. (Government Exhibit
3; Applicant Exhibit L; Tr. 60-63.)
In addition to the debts discussed above, Applicant submitted evidence showing
that  he had paid off  other  delinquent  debts  before  issuance of  the  SOR.  (Government
Exhibit 5 at 8; Applicant Exhibit CC; Tr. 52-55.)
Mitigation
Applicant provided five letters of recommendation from people who know him in
the  defense  industry,  including  supervisors.  He  is  described  as  a  man  of  character,  a
person who is trustworthy, and a respected and valued contributor. They all recommend
him for a position of trust. (Applicant Exhibits N through R.)
Applicant  served  in  the  Marine  Corps  from  2006  to  2011.  He  had  an  excellent
career, as shown in various letters of commendation that he received.  He received an
Honorable Discharge at the end of his military service. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section
15; Applicant Exhibits S through Y; Tr. 64-66.)
