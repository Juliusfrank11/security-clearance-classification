Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted for a $5,735 Federal
tax lien for tax year 2007 entered in 2010; failed to timely file his Federal tax returns for
tax years 2007 and 2010 through 2012 and those returns remain unfiled; and failed to
timely file his Federal tax returns for 2009 and 2015 through 2017. Applicant denies the
tax lien stating that the IRS withheld subsequent refunds to satisfy the lien (SOR ¶ 1.a).
He admits that he has not filed his outstanding tax returns (SOR ¶ 1.b) and that he filed
his other returns late (SOR ¶ 1.c). Applicant disclosed the derogatory tax information on
his  e-QIP  and  discussed  it  during  his  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  and  in  his
responses to DOHA’s interrogatories. (GX 3; GX 4.) His admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact.
Applicant, 49, is an audio-visual technician working for a defense contractor since
June  2013.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  1989.  He  enlisted  in  the  U.S.  Army  in
February 1992, but received a general discharge under honorable conditions in May 1992
for pre-existing medical condition.  He has never been married and has an adult daughter.
This is his first application for a security clearance. (GX 3.)
There  is  no  personal  income  tax  in  the  state  where  Applicant  lives.  In  his  PSI,
Applicant stated that he did not file or pay his Federal income tax for 2007, which resulted
in the $5,735 lien that was entered in 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.a), because he did not have the
money to do so. In his Answer, he stated his 2013 through 2016 and a portion of his 2017
tax  refunds  were  used  to  satisfy  the  lien.  He  provided  documentation  from  the  IRS
showing that he received an $869 refund for 2017.
Applicant  began  experiencing  overall  financial  difficulties  after  losing  his  job  in
2009. He owned and operated his own business between April 2009 and June 2013 and
did not have the money to pay his taxes. He fell behind on his mortgage-loan payments
and his home was ultimately sold in a foreclosure sale. The lender cancelled the loan-
balance  debt  and  issued  Applicant  an  IRS  Form  1099-C  Cancellation  of  Debt  in  the
amount of $26,156 in 2012. Applicant was required to claim this amount as income on his
2012 tax return. (GX 3.)
On his May 2016 e-QIP, Applicant stated that he had contacted the IRS to set up
a payment plan for the then still outstanding lien balance. In order to enter a repayment
plan, the IRS required Applicant to file his 2010 through 2012 returns and gave him until
June 3, 2016, to file. He did not meet the deadline. During his August 2016 PSI, Applicant
stated that he was trying to obtain the necessary documents to file his delinquent returns.
In his May 2020 Answer, he stated that he had gathered the necessary documents and
was preparing the returns to mail to the IRS as soon as possible. The record does not
contain any evidence that Applicant has filed his 2010 through 2012 tax returns.
Applicant admits that he did not timely file  his 2009 and  2015 through 2017 tax
returns (SOR ¶ 1.c), stating that he mistakenly believed he was only required to file  by
the April 15th  deadline if he owed money. He  also stated that he now  timely  files his tax
returns.
Applicant’s current financial status is stable. He is current on his ongoing financial
obligations including his mortgage loan, automobile loan, and a credit-card account. His
recent CBR shows numerous “paid and closed” accounts. (GX 5; GX 6.)
