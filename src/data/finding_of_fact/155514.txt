Applicant  traveled  to  the  Dominican  Republic  with  male  friends  on  three
occasions between April 2013 and September 2014 for what were essentially extended
bachelor  parties.  On  each  trip,  he  solicited  the  services  of  prostitutes  and  engaged  in
sexual  intercourse  and  oral  sex  with  the  prostitutes  for  money.  (Tr.  at  16-19,  21-27;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3)
Applicant  revealed  his  involvement  with  prostitutes  when  he  was  interviewed  in
conjunction  with  a  polygraph  for   his  security  clearance  in   September  2014,  about  a
week after he returned  from his last trip  to the Dominican Republic. He  eventually told
his wife while they were going through couple’s counseling in  about 2018.  (Tr. at 18, 27-

Applicant is remorseful for his conduct. He credibly testified that he has not been
with a prostitute since the September 2014 trip, and he will never do so again. He and
his wife have worked through their difficulties and have a strong relationship. He would
not risk his marriage, family, security clearance, and job by engaging in such conduct in
the future. Many of the important people in his life, including his wife and employer, are
aware of what he did. He would reveal his conduct to anyone else rather than succumb
to blackmail or coercion. (Tr. at 17-21, 29-31, 34, 36; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE

Applicant  volunteers  in  his  community  and  coaches  youth  sports.  He  called  a

performance  and  sound  moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his  honesty,  loyalty,
patriotism,  reliability,  judgment,  work  ethic,  trustworthiness,  dedication,  and  integrity.
