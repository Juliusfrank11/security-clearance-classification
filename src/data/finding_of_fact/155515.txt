Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  except  ¶¶  1.g  and  1.i,  which  he
denied. He is 38 years old. He married in 2003, separated in 2011, divorced in 2019, and
has been engaged to be married since April 2019. He has two minor children. (Answer;
Tr. at 12, 24, 43; GE 1)
Applicant graduated from high school in 2000. He earned an associate’s degree
and  attended  college  towards  a  bachelor’s  degree.  He  served  honorably  in  the  U.S.
military for 15 years, from 2002 to 2017; he deployed four times, in 2004, 2008, from 2013
to  2014,  and  from  2014  to  2015.  He  previously  worked  for  two  DOD  contractors  from
August  2017  to  September  2019,  when  he  lost  his  job  due  to  issues  arising  with  his
security  clearance.  He  was  subsequently  unemployed  from  September  2019  to  March
2020, during which time he drove for Uber and Lyft. As of the date of the hearing and
since March 2020, he worked in the field of information technology for the Air National
Guard  (ANG).  Both  Department  Counsel  and  Applicant  confirmed  at  the  hearing  that
Applicant was being sponsored for a security clearance. He was first granted a security
clearance while he served in the U.S. military. (Tr. at 6, 22, 33, 42-43, 45, 49-50, 55-56,
71-75, 94, 106; GE 1; AE L)
The SOR alleges five delinquent consumer accounts totaling $9,333 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a,
1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i), a $4,068 delinquent student loan (SOR ¶ 1.b), three delinquent debts
with the U.S. Government totaling $2,007 (SOR  ¶¶ 1.c, 1.e, 1.g), and $21,802 in child
support  arrears  (SOR  ¶ 1.j).  The  debts  are  established  by Applicant’s admissions and
credit reports from 2018, 2019, and 2020. (GE 1-4)
Applicant and  his fiancée  attributed his delinquent debts  to  the  following factors:
(1)   his   ex-wife’s  failure  to   properly  handle   the   family  finances;  (2)   a  lengthy  divorce,
initiated by him in 2014 but not finalized until January 2019, during which time he learned
about the extent of the delinquent debts incurred during his marriage; (3) a 2014 order
that he pay $800 monthly in child support and $20,000 in retroactive arrears; (4) a 2017
modification of that order increasing his child support to $2,000 monthly when he became
a senior consultant for a DOD contractor and earned approximately $130,000 annually;
and  (5)  his  above-mentioned  period  of  unemployment,  during  which  time  he  was  still
required to pay $2,000 monthly in child support. (Tr. at 17-39, 41-109; GE 1-4; AE A-L)
As of the date of the hearing, Applicant paid six of his ten delinquent debts (SOR
¶¶ 1.c, 1.e-1.i) and he was in the process of resolving the remaining four (SOR ¶¶ 1.a,
1.b, 1.d, 1.j). (AE A-K)
SOR  ¶  1.a  is  a  $6,096  charged-off  car  loan  for  a  car  Applicant  and  his  ex-wife
purchased  in  around  2009;  she  was  the  primary  account  holder  and  he  was  the
secondary.  Applicant’s  ex-wife  handled  the  family’s  finances  when  he  was  deployed
overseas with the U.S. military. Unbeknownst to him, she did not make the car payments.
She also failed to do so during the divorce proceedings, even though he sent her money
to  make  the  payments.  He  accepted  responsibility  for  the  loan  as  part  of  finalizing  his
divorce. While he initially had trouble accessing the account since he was not the primary
account holder, he made three monthly payments of $25 between April and June 2020
and two payments of $50 in July 2020. Documentation from the creditor reflects a balance
of $6,045 as of May 2020. He plans to continue paying the account until it is paid in full.
(Tr. at 51-55, 71-74, 104; AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.b is for a $4,068 student loan in collection. Applicant obtained the student
loan to attend college in 2000 and it was placed in forbearance from 2002 to 2017, while
he served in the U.S. military. After his 2017 discharge, he forgot about the loan. He did
not receive any correspondence from the creditor after having moved several times from
the address in which he lived when he obtained the loan. The creditor located him in 2019
and offered him a loan rehabilitation, through which he made a $107 payment in January
2019  and  $150  monthly  payments  from  February  until  June  2019,  when  he  lost  his
security clearance, his pay was significantly decreased, and he eventually lost his job that
September. He resumed making payments of $5 monthly through a rehabilitation program
in December 2019. As of June 2020, his balance was $2,997. (Tr. at 55-59, 74-78, 86,
96-97, 106; GE 1; AE B, C)
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.g are overpayments that Applicant received for his monthly U.S.
military housing allowance, in collection for $573 and $125, respectively. As soon as he
learned about them, he paid $400 and resolved the outstanding balance in October 2017.
He subsequently called the VA several times and verified that he does not owe anything
further. (Tr. at 59-61; AE D)
SOR ¶ 1.d is for a $2,626 credit card in collection. Applicant obtained the credit
card in around 2008; his ex-wife was an authorized user. She incurred charges and failed
to  make  payments  on  the  card  while  he  was  deployed  overseas.  He  accepted
responsibility for the card as part of finalizing his divorce. He located the creditor at the
end of 2019 and began making payments. His friends also lent him some money, which
he intends to repay, to help him pay this debt. He testified that the balance as of the date
of the hearing was $2,000. (Tr. at 61-65, 78-79, 99-100; AE E, K)
SOR ¶ 1.e is for $1,309 in moving expenses in collection. Applicant incurred these
expenses when he moved from his last duty station with the U.S. military to a location
that  was  not  his  home  of  record.  He  paid  this  debt  through  $100  monthly  automatic
deductions from his ANG pay. His September 2018 ANG paystub reflects that this debt
was paid. (Tr. at 65-67, 79-80; AE F)
SOR  ¶  1.f  is  for  a  $339  charged-off  debt  that  Applicant  incurred  during  his
marriage, though he was unaware of the nature of the debt. He paid it in November 2019,
when  he  accepted  responsibility  for  the  debt  as  part  of  finalizing  his  divorce.  He
acknowledged that he also wanted to resolve this debt upon receiving the SOR. (Tr. at
67-68, 80-82; AE G)
SOR ¶ 1.h is for an electric bill in collection for $167. Applicant incurred this bill
when he moved and incorrectly believed that his deposit would be applied towards it when
he discontinued service. He paid it in November 2018. (Tr. at 68-69; AE H)
SOR ¶ 1.i is for a television and internet account in collection for $105. Applicant
opened this account between around 2008 and 2010. Documentation from the creditor
reflects that this debt was paid in November 2019. (Tr. at 69-70; AE I)
SOR  ¶  1.j  is  for  $21,802  in   child   support  arrears.  As  previously  discussed,
Applicant  was  ordered   in   2014   to  pay   $800  monthly  in   child  support   and   $20,000  in
retroactive   arrears.  The  state  Attorney  General’s  (AG)   Office  of  Child   Support  (OCS)
pulled $10,000 from his retirement savings account  and applied it towards his arrears.  In
2017, when his child support  obligation was  modified  to $2,000 monthly, the state AG’s
OCS  began  applying   approximately   $1,000   to  his   $10,000   arrears  balance   and   the
remainder towards his  monthly obligation. He was unable to make any payments  when
he became unemployed, but  resumed making his child support payments  in March  2020
when he became re-employed. His child support balance as of August 2020 was $13,
194.  As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  he   was  seeking  a  modification  to  his  child  support
order  and  his outstanding arrears  balance  to reflect the  decrease in  his income to $60,000
annually. (Tr. at 45-51, 82-94; AE J)
Applicant has earned $60,000 annually  since  March 2020. He  plans to  continue to
resolve his delinquent debts.  He  received  debt counseling in  2017.  While he considered
debt consolidation, he elected to resolve his  finances on his own and  with his fiancée’s
advice. He  also keeps track of  his finances through a credit monitoring service. (Tr. at 45-
46, 70, 87-89, 101-109; GE 1; AE K)
Applicant’s fiancée testified. She and Applicant began dating in December 2013,
when he was legally separated from his ex-wife, and they got engaged in April 2019. She
holds a position of public trust in the U.S. Government. She testified that she was aware
of Applicant’s delinquent debts, knew that he paid several of them, and was in the process
of paying his child support arrears. She described him as fiscally responsible and a hard
worker. She testified that she has a high credit score and they expect to combine their
finances when they are married. (Tr. at 17-39)
