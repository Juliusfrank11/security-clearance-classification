Applicant is 61 years old and married. Applicant has four children, although his son
died in 2008 at the age of 20. Applicant has a Bachelor of Science degree, a Master’s
degree in Business Administration, and has taken courses to receive his doctorate. This
is Applicant’s first application for a security clearance. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections
12, 13A, and 17; Tr. 85-90.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  failed  to  meet  his  financial  obligations  and  is  therefore  potentially
unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
Applicant admitted all the allegations in both SOR 1 and SOR 2, with the exception of
subparagraphs 1.j and 1.k, which he denied. Neither SOR contains subparagraphs 1.l,
nor 1.m. SOR 2 allegations are denoted subparagraphs n. through r. He also submitted
additional information to support the granting of national security eligibility.
Applicant’s  wife supervises the household  finances and testified about them.  Her
husband adopted her testimony in its entirety. (Tr. 37-38, 68-69.)
Turning first to Applicant’s Federal taxes:
1.a.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  not  filed  his  Federal  income  tax  return  in  a
timely manner for tax year 2010. Applicant and his wife explained that their accountant,
as well as a representative of the IRS, told them in approximately 2018 that they should
not  file  the  return  because  of  the  statute  of  limitations.  This  return  has  not  been  filed.
(Answer 1; Tr. 32-38, 57-58.)
1.b.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  not  filed  his  Federal  income  tax  return  in  a
timely manner for tax year 2011. Applicant and his wife explained that their accountant,
as well as a representative of the IRS, told them in approximately 2018 that they should
not  file  the  return  because  of  the  statute  of  limitations.  This  return  has  not  been  filed.
(Answer 1; Tr. 32-38, 57-58.)
1.c.   Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  not  filed  his  Federal  income  tax  return  in  a
timely manner for tax year 2013. The tax return was actually filed on January 8, 2019. As
of  May  6,  2019,  Applicant  owed  approximately  $13,106  in  back  taxes,  interest,  and
penalties.  No  payments  have  been  made  towards  this  tax  year.  As  further  discussed
below, Applicant is working on submitting an offer in compromise to the IRS. No further
information was provided. (Government Exhibit 2 at 5; Tr. 39-41.)

timely manner for tax year 2015. The tax return was actually filed on January 8, 2019. As
of September 9, 2019, Applicant owed approximately $28,686 in back taxes, interest, and
penalties.  No  payments  have  been  made  towards  this  tax  year.  As  further  discussed
below, Applicant is working on submitting an offer in compromise to the IRS. No further
information was provided. (Government Exhibit 3 at 7; Tr. 39-41.)
1.f. Applicant admitted that he had not filed his Federal income tax return in a timely
manner for tax year 2016. The tax return was actually filed on January 8, 2019. As of April
23, 2019, Applicant owed approximately $17,755 in back taxes, interest, and penalties.
No  payments  have  been  made  towards  this  tax  year.  As  further  discussed  below,
Applicant  is  working  on  submitting  an  offer  in  compromise  to  the  IRS.  No  further
information was provided. (Government Exhibit 3 at 8; Tr. 39-41.)
1.g.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  not  filed  his  Federal  income  tax  return  in  a
timely manner for tax year 2017. The tax return was actually filed on January 8, 2019. As
of September 9, 2019, Applicant owed approximately $13,869 in back taxes, interest and
penalties.  No  payments  have  been  made  towards  this  tax  year.  As  further  discussed
below, Applicant is working on submitting an offer in compromise to the IRS. No further
information was provided. (Government Exhibit 3 at 9; Tr. 39-41.)
According to an IRS document submitted by Applicant in August 2019 his account
balance was approximately $119,009. Applicant and his wife have been working on an
offer in compromise to submit to the IRS for several months. Their first one was submitted
when  Applicant  had  a  substantially  higher  income  than  he  currently  earnes.  Applicant
submitted as an exhibit an “Offer In Compromise Pre-Qualifier” worksheet that he and his
wife had prepared. He also submitted IRS booklet 656 “Offer In Compromise.” However,
Applicant did not submit a completed and signed offer in compromise. Nor is there any
evidence  that  their  offer  in  compromise  had  been  received  or  accepted  by  the  IRS.
(Government Exhibit 3 at 11-12; Applicant Exhibits K, Q, and R; Tr. 44-45, 62-63.)
Turning to Applicant’s state taxes:
1.h. Applicant admitted not filing a state tax return for tax year 2010. Applicant’s
wife again testified that they had been told by the state tax authorities and their accountant
that due to the statute of limitations no tax return was due for that year. (Answer 1; Tr. 57-
58.)
1.i. Applicant  admitted not  filing a state tax  return for tax  year 2011. Applicant’s
wife again testified that they had been told by the state tax authorities and their accountant
that due to the statute of limitations no tax return was due for that year. (Answer 1; Tr. 57-
58.)
1.j.  Applicant  admitted  not  filing  state  tax  returns  for  the  tax  years  2013,  2014,
2015, 2016, and 2017, in a timely fashion. Records from the state tax authority show that
the returns were all filed on January 4, 2019. Even though the returns were not filed until
2019, it appears that Applicant and his wife reached a payment agreement with the state
tax  authorities  to  pay  their  back  taxes  at  an  earlier  date.  They  have  been  making
consistent monthly payments since 2017. As of February 2, 2021, current balance was
$9,028. (Government Exhibit 2 at 7-10, Exhibit 3 at 14-27; Applicant Exhibits E, F, G, and
H; Tr. 58.)
Applicant’s wife stated that it was always her intention to file Federal and state tax
returns  every  year,  but  she  was  just  procrastinating.  Part  of  the  reason  for  her
procrastination was the aftermath of their 20-year-old son’s sudden death in 2008. They
began to work on filing the back taxes because they were becoming concerned about the
IRS and the amount of back taxes they owed. (Tr. 39-40, 56-57, 85-90.)
Turning to the general consumer debts, SOR 1.k to 1.r. Support for the existence
and  amount  of  these  debts  is  found  in  the  credit  reports  in  the  record  dated  June  26,
2020; and February 2, 2021. (Government Exhibits 4 and 5.).
Applicant and his wife both stated that the primary reason the following debts got
so  high  was  because  of  a  significant  pay  loss  due  to  Applicant  being  laid  off  from  his
former  employment.  They  had  to  prioritize  what  debts  they  could  pay.  (Government
Exhibit 1 at Section 13A; Applicant Exhibits A and J; Tr. 50-51, 54-55.)
1.k. Applicant denied owing $2,749 to a university for a past-due debt placed for
collection. According to Applicant this is a wrongful debt that the university is attempting
to have him pay despite the fact they had been paid by the Federal government. Even
though Applicant believes he does not owe this debt, he made a one-time payment to a
collection agency to show his good faith. (Applicant Exhibit N at 5; Tr. 48-49, 83-87.)
Neither SOR 1 nor SOR 2 contain subparagraphs 1.l or 1.m.
1.n.  Applicant  admitted owing  a bank  $669  for a charged-off  account.  Applicant
made a payment arrangement with the collection agency and paid the agreed amount on
February 2, 2021, as shown by documentation from the creditor. This debt is resolved.
(Applicant Exhibit D; Tr. 49-50.)
1.o. Applicant admitted owing a bank $1,869 for a charged-off account. Applicant
made a payment arrangement with the collection agency for a reduced amount and has
made  three  monthly  payments  for  $34  each.  This  debt  is  being  resolved.  (Applicant
Exhibits B, N, and O; Tr. 51-52.)
1.p. Applicant admitted owing a bank $2,721 for a charged-off account. Applicant
made a payment arrangement with the collection agency for a reduced amount and has
made  three  monthly  payments  of  $34  each.  This  debt  is  being  resolved.  (Applicant
Exhibits B and O; Tr. 52-53.)
1.q. Applicant admitted owing a bank $6,470 for a charged-off account. Applicant
made a payment arrangement with the collection agency and paid the agreed amount on
February 2, 2021, according to Applicant’s wife. This debt is resolved. (Applicant Exhibits
B and C; Tr. 53.)
1.r. Applicant admitted owing a bank $3,655 for a charged-off account. Applicant
made a payment arrangement with the collection agency for a reduced amount and has
made three monthly payments of $25 each. This debt is being resolved. (Applicant Exhibit
B; Tr. 53.)
Mitigation
Applicant  submitted  letters  of  recommendation  from  friends  and  his  current
landlord.  These  documents  show  that  he  is  a  respected  and  trustworthy  person.
(Applicant Exhibit Applicant Exhibit M.)
