In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations with explanations.
His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working
at his present job in November 2015. He experienced unemployment for approximately
four months in 2015 and from July 2009 to May 2010. He served honorably in the U.S.
Navy  for  20  years,  retiring  in  2009  as  a  petty  officer  first  class  (E-6).  He  has  a  high
school diploma and an associate’s degree. He has been married for over 30 years and
has two adult children. (Tr. at 6, 38; GE 1; SOR answer)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  failed  to  file  his  2014-2016  federal  income  tax
returns as required; his 2014-2015 state income tax returns as required;  that he owed
delinquent federal taxes in the amount of approximately $1,932 for tax year 2017; and
that he owed delinquent state taxes in the amount of approximately $2,325 for tax years
2012,  2016,  and 2017.  He admitted  failing to file his  federal and  state tax returns  and
owing delinquent taxes to both entities in his June 2017 security clearance application
(SCA),  as  well  as  in  his  SOR  answer.  He  supplied  documentation  when  answering
interrogatories  that  supported  the  delinquent  tax  debts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  –  1.d).  (GE  1-2;
SOR answer)
Applicant attributed his tax problems to a number of things. He is the sole income
earner for his family because his wife has been unable to work for the past 19 years due
to  serious  medical  issues.  In  2011  or  2012,  he  neglected  to  adjust  his  wage
withholdings  when  his  two  children  were  no  longer  dependents  for  tax  purposes.  He
also  became  the  guardian  and  conservator  for  his  grandfather  and  his  estate.  The
expenses  associated  with  performing  these  tasks  added  a  financial  burden  for  him.  In
May 2015, Applicant had not filed his 2014 federal or state tax returns. He realized that
he would owe the IRS  a significant amount. Also, his  daughter’s wedding was coming
up later that month. He chose not to deal with his taxes then and paid for the wedding,
thinking he would deal with the taxes after the wedding. In August 2015, he was laid off
from his job and unable to address his tax issues. In November 2015, he was rehired on
a  part-time  basis,  which  became  full  time  in  April  2016.  About  the  same  time,  he  was
involved in a motorcycle accident, which required him to go on short-term disability. The
disability payments were late in coming, adding to his financial troubles. He timely filed
his  2017  federal  tax  return,  but  he  did  not  pay  the  amount  he  owed  ($1,931).  He
disclosed  his  tax  issues  when  he  completed  his  SCA  in  June  2017.  (GE  1-2;  SOR
answer)
In  answering  Government  interrogatories  in  August  2019,  Applicant  supplied
requested documentation concerning his federal and state taxes. For tax year 2014, the
IRS  filed  a  substitute  tax  return  for  him  in  December  2018.  For  tax  year  2015,  IRS
records show no return was filed as of February 2019. For tax year 2016, Applicant filed
his  federal  return  late  in  October  2017,  for  which  he  was  assessed  a  penalty.  A
document from the state department of revenue shows that Applicant had not filed his
2015  state  tax  return  and  that  he  owed  $2,325  in  delinquent  taxes.  Applicant
acknowledged  that  he  owed  both  the  IRS  and  the  state  for  taxes  from  these  unfiled
years, but he did not know what that amount was. (Tr. at 28-31; GE 3)
Applicant  hired  a  tax  preparation  service  (TPS)  in  January  2020  to  prepare  his
2014  and  2015  federal  tax  returns.  He  testified  that  he  also  engaged  them  to  file  his
2018  and  2019  federal  returns  because  they  had  not  been  filed.  Documentation
indicated  that  TPS  was  preparing  Applicant’s  federal  tax  returns  for  years  2012-2019
(The  untimely  filings  of  Applicant’s  2012-2013,  2018,  and  2019  federal  tax  returns  will
not  be  used  by  me  for  disqualification  purposes,  but  I  may  use  this  information  to
determine  credibility,  whether  mitigating  conditions  are  applicable,  and  for  the
application of whole-person factors). Applicant paid an investigation fee of $495 to TPS.
Further fees to TPS would be determined after the investigation. Applicant testified that
he  paid  TPS  approximately  $7,000  in  monthly  payments  from  February  2020  through
November  2020.  These  payments  came  from  his  monthly  military  retirement  pay.  He
documented  the  agreement  for  the  investigation  fee,  but  he  did  not  document  the
monthly payment agreement with TPS. (Tr. at 20, 22-23, 32, 36-37; GE C, F)
Applicant did not provide copies of the federal tax returns prepared by TPS, even
though  he  specifically  stated  he  would  do  so.  He  provided  IRS  account  transcripts  for
tax years 2018 and 2019 showing that his 2018 return was filed in August 2020 and that
his 2019 return was filed in October 2020. An email from a TPS representative stated:
We  have  finished  completing  your  2018-2019  Tax  Returns  and  received
confirmation  from  the  IRS  that  they  have  finished  processing.  We  are
currently working on the final resolution for Tax Years 2012-2019. At this
time  your  case  is  being  reviewed  in  the  Resolution  phase  where  we  will
examine your penalties and your final balance.
From this email, it is unclear what  is meant by the “final  resolution for Tax  years 2012-
2019.”  There is no documentation showing that Applicant’s 2014 and   2015 federal tax
returns  have  been  filed.  Additionally,  while  Applicant’s  2019  federal  account   transcript
shows that his refund of $1,288 was applied to his 2017  tax  owed (2017 amount owed
was  $1,931  as  shown  in   SOR  ¶  1.b),   that  amount  was  insufficient  to  satisfy  the  full
amount. There is no  further  indication of  payments toward the  remaining  2017 tax  owed.
Applicant  provided  documentation  showing  that  his  2020  federal  and   state  tax   returns
were filed and  that he is scheduled to receive refunds on both.  Nothing  shows that the
returns have been processed  by the IRS or the state. Applicant  admitted that he has not
done anything toward filing his missing  state tax  returns for  2014 and  2015 because  he
is waiting for  his federal returns to  be processed  by the IRS first. He  also does not know
how much he owes the state for delinquent taxes. (Tr. at 23, 25-26, 28-31; GE D-F)
Applicant  provided  six  letters  from  coworkers,  colleagues,  and  a  former
supervisor.  All  describe  his  loyalty,  dedication,  and  security  worthiness.  Several  also
wrote about some of the difficulties Applicant has experienced in the past several years,
including  his  wife’s illness,  the  stress and  financial strain caused  by  him  taking  on the
conservator  duties  for  his  grandfather,  and  the  motorcycle  accident  he  suffered.  The
authors also pointed out Applicant’s involvement in civic duties, such as organizing the
local  Veterans  Day  activities  and  working  with  a  retired  military  association.  Applicant
also provided performance appraisals from 2016 through 2020. He was rated at the top
rating, either “outstanding” or “superior” on all of them. (AE B; SOR answer)
