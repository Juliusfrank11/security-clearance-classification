Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  her  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the  pleadings,  including  Applicant’s  admissions  in  her  Answer  to  all  of  the  SOR
allegations,  her  testimony,  and  the  documentary  evidence  in  the  record,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant,  52,  is  employed  by   a  U.S.   Government  contractor  as  a  quality
supervisor.  Her 2018 SCA is her first  application for  a security clearance. She has worked
for  this contractor  continuously since 2007. In 1985, she earned a high school  diploma in
the Philippines,  where  she was  born. In 1993, she  married a man who was also born in
the Philippines. Prior  to  their  marriage, her husband had immigrated to  the United States.
He  sponsored her immigration visa,  and  she entered the United States in  1998.  Applicant
became a U.S. citizen in 2005. They have three  adult children. The two oldest were born
in  the Philippines,  and the youngest was born in  the United States. All three children are
U.S. citizens. They  are now  grown, and  live on their own without any support  from  their
parents. (Tr. at 25, 31; GE 2 at 8.)
Applicant and her husband have owned their home since 2012. Applicant’s mother
has  lived  with  them  since  2008.  Her  mother  was  also  born  in  the  Philippines  and
immigrated to the United States. She became a U.S. citizen in 2018 or 2019. Applicant
has a brother who resides with his wife and children in the Philippines. (Tr. at 75-77.)
Financial Considerations
Applicant and her husband together earn about $164,000 per year. Neither of them
incurred  a  job  loss  at  any  time  in  recent  years.  Applicant  testified  that  her  husband’s
income  in  some  years  was  less  than  usual,  which  is  about  $100,000  annually,  due  to
changes  in  his  work  schedule  and  loss  of  overtime.  Her  husband  works  for  the  U.S.
military overseas as a civilian. He is away from home much of the time. The couple largely
keep their finances separate with the exception of a joint savings account with a balance
of about $9,000. (Tr. at 27-29, 31-32; 55.)
At the hearing, Applicant admitted that much of her financial problems were due to
her  overspending  on  her  credit  cards.  She  also  had  a  child  in  college.  These
circumstances caused some financial difficulties. The debts alleged in the SOR relate to
her credit-card debts. In January 2016, Applicant obtained a loan in the amount of about
$50,000 that she used to pay off some of her credit cards. In or about February 2017, she
defaulted in repaying this loan. The Government’s credit report at that time also revealed
that she defaulted on eight credit-card accounts, which are listed in the SOR. All of the
credit cards are solely in her name. (GE 1 at 41-42, 43-49, 73; GE 3 at 4-5.)
In her January 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed that she had consolidated her credit-
card  debts  with  a  debt-consolidation  company.  She  wrote  that  her  financial  problems
began in March 2017. She testified that she saw an advertisement on TV for a business
that provided debt-consolidation services. She contacted the company and entered into
an agreement with it. She understood the company would contact her creditors and pay
them out of funds she paid to the company. She stopped paying her creditors directly.
She subsequently realized that this debt-consolidation plan was a mistake because her
creditors continued to contact her and pressure her to pay her debts. She terminated her
contract with the company, and decided to pay her creditors directly. (Tr. at 32-34.)
The history and current status of Applicant’s nine admitted debts listed in the SOR
are as follows:
SOR ¶  1.a, Credit-Card Account in the amount of  $8,654. This account was opened in
2011 and  became  delinquent  in  or  about  April 2017.  The creditor  has charged off  this
debt and transferred this account to a collection agency. Applicant has made no payments
on this account since it became delinquent. She is hoping the creditor will contact her with
a  settlement  offer.  She  will  then  negotiate  an  affordable  settlement.  This  debt  is  not
resolved. (Tr. at 35-36; GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 1
SOR ¶  1.b, Credit-Card Account in the amount of  $5,938. This account was opened
in July 2016 and became delinquent in or about March 2017. The creditor charged off this
account in September 2017. The creditor filed a lawsuit and obtained a garnishment of
Applicant’s wages. She presently owes about $217, and it will be fully paid off in the near
future.  This  debt  is  being  involuntarily  resolved  by  a  court-ordered  garnishment.
(Tr. at 36; GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 4.)
SOR ¶  1.c, Credit-Card Account in the amount of  $5,767. This account was opened in
December 2017 and became delinquent in or about May 2018. The creditor transferred
the account to a collection agency. Applicant testified that she spoke with the new creditor
about  two  weeks  prior  to  the  hearing.  She  is  waiting  to  receive  from  the  creditor  a
settlement offer so that she can begin paying this debt. This debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶   1.d,  Credit-Card  Account  in  the  amount  of   $4,204.  The  credit  reports  in  the
record do not list the date when this collection account was opened with the original credit-
card issuer. The reports reflect that the account became delinquent in or about February
2017. Applicant recently received a settlement offer to pay $263 per month on a reduced
amount of about $3,100. She spoke with the creditor by phone two months ago and has
made  one  or  two  payments  on  the  settlement.  The  Government’s  most  recent  credit
report in the record, dated October 22, 2020, reflects a balance due of $3,264, about $940
less than the original amount of the debt. After the hearing, Applicant provided AE A from
the  creditor,  which  reflects  a  payment  of  $527  on  or  about  October  21,  2020,  and  an
outstanding balance of $2,636. The evidence suggests that she has made payments of
about  $500  to  $900  under  this  settlement.  Her  next  payment  of  $236  was  due  on
November 15, 2020. This debt is being resolved with a payment plan. (Tr. at 38-39;
GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 3; GE 6 at 2; AE A.)
SOR ¶  1.e, Credit-Card Account in the amount of  $3,954. This account was opened in
December 2017 and became delinquent in or about March 2017. It has been transferred
to a collection agency. Applicant testified that she has been paying $234 per month since
May or June 2020 under a payment plan to settle this debt in the amount of $3,264. She
believes that she now owes about $1,600 on this account. Government Exhibit 6, dated
October 22, 2020, reflects a balance due of $3,690. After the hearing, Applicant provided
AE B from the creditor, which reflects a payment of $235 on October 27, 2020, and an
outstanding balance due of $3,009. This debt is being resolved with a payment plan.
(Tr. at 39-41; GE 4 at 2; GE 6 at 2; AE Y.)
SOR ¶  1.f, Credit-Card Account  in the amount of  $3,651. This account was opened in
November 2002 and became delinquent in March 2017. The account has been charged
off and transferred to a collection agency. Applicant claims that about two weeks prior to
the hearing, she accepted a settlement offer from the creditor in the amount of $1,700 to
be paid in its entirety or in unknown monthly amounts over time. She is waiting to receive
confirmation of the terms in the mail. This debt is not resolved.  (Tr. at 42-43; GE 3 at
5; GE 4 at 2; GE 6 at 5; AE Z.)
SOR ¶  1.g,  Loan  Account in the amount  of  $49,431. This debt is the January 2016
debt-consolidation loan in  the amount of $50,000  that Applicant  used to pay off  some of
her credit cards.  She testified that she was experiencing  financial difficulties in  2015. She
responded to an offer from a  commercial lender of  a credit-card consolidation loan to pay
off   her   credit  cards.  The   loan  terms  required  that  she  pay  $800  per  month.  Applicant
testified that the original  amount of the loan was  only  $35,000. She could not explain how
the loan became $50,000, as the Government’s credit report  reflects.  She defaulted on
repaying  the  loan  about  one   year  later.  Applicant   testified   further  that  she  has  been
repaying this debt for the last two years under a payment plan that requires her  to  pay
$600  per  month  for   five  years   for   a  total   amount  of  $39,000.   She  does  not  know   the
amount of the current  balance  of this debt.  She testified that she could provide emails
after the hearing to show   “all   the payments.”  She failed to produce any documentation
supporting   her  testimony  regarding   a  payment  plan  or  her   payments   thereunder.
Government Exhibit 3 lists this debt as reported by Experian. The   Government’s three
more   recent  credit   reports  are   from  Equifax   and   do  not  reflect  this  debt.   Applicant’s
evidence is insufficient to support a conclusion that this debt is being resolved.
(Tr. at 43-47; GE 3 at 4.)
SOR  ¶   1.h,  Credit-Card  Account  in   the  amount  of   $3,636.  Applicant  opened  this
account in December 2016. The account became delinquent in March 2017. The creditor
charged off the account in September 2017. She testified that she has not paid anything
on this account since then. In September 2020 she made an offer to the creditor to resolve
this debt with a payment of 30% of the balance. She is waiting to receive a response. She
provided no documentary evidence to support her testimony. This debt has not yet been
resolved. (Tr. at 48-49; GE 3 at 5.)
SOR  ¶   1.i,  Credit-Card  Account  in  the   amount  of   $3,147.  Applicant   opened   this
account in  December 2002.  She became delinquent on  this account  in  March 2017. The
account  was  charged   off  in   the  amount  of   $5,245  and   was  transferred  to  a   collection
agency.  Applicant   testified  that  this   debt  was  settled  in   2017  or  2018  by  her   debt-
consolidation company. Government Exhibit 5,  dated February 28, 2020,  reflects that the
debt was paid. This debt has  been resolved. (Tr. at  64-65; GE  3 at  5;  GE 5  at  4;  GE 6
at 4.)
In addition to the above debts, Applicant has a credit-card account with a balance
of about $21,856. The credit limit is $22,100. This account is current. Applicant pays about
$438 per month to keep the account current. She no longer uses her credit cards as she
once  did.  She  offered  no  evidence,  however,  that  she  has  any  credit  cards  with  any
unused credit. She admitted she used to shop excessively. Now she controls herself, and
her  spending  has  “changed  a  lot.”  In  addition  to  her  joint  savings  account  with  her
husband, she has a 401K retirement account with her employer with about $154,000 in
investments.  She  was  promoted  to  a  supervisory  position  in  2020  and  makes  about
$73,000 annually. Her “target” is to pay off her debts in 2021. (Tr. at 8, 55-57, 73-74).
Foreign Influence
Applicant  testified  that  her  mother  has  lived  in  the  United  States  with  Applicant
since 2008 and is now a naturalized U.S. citizen. Her mother supports herself with Social
Security Supplemental Security Income, or SSI. Applicant also testified that her brother
is  a  laborer  in  the  Philippines  and  has  a  wife  and  children.  In  the  past,  Applicant  has
helped support her brother and his family with cash payments. She has also paid for the
cost of educating her nephews and nieces. In the first ten months of 2020, she has given
her brother about $400-$500. In the past, she has given him and his family as much as
$1,200  in  a  year.  Applicant  talks  with  her  brother  on  the  phone  about  once  per  week.
Applicant  last  traveled  to  the  Philippines  to  visit  her  brother  in  2016.  She  has  a  close
relationship with her brother. (Tr. at 59-63, 75-77.)
The Philippines
The U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution
when  traveling  to  the  Philippines  due  to  crime,  terrorism,  and  civil  unrest.  The  State
Department advises that there is considerable risk of terrorism in the country. Terrorist
organizations and criminal gangs operate throughout the country. Some groups are allied
with the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham, also known as ISIS. The organizations and
gangs  conduct  bombing  attacks  and  kidnappings  against
foreigners,  civilians,
government institutions, and security forces.
