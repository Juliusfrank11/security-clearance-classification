Applicant  has  a  history  of   tax   issues,  which  he  eventually  resolves.  A  credit
report   from  June  2013  listed  a  $7,013  federal  tax  lien  that  was   filed  in  2003  and
released in 2007 after the taxes were paid; and an $818 federal tax lien that was filed in
2009 and  released in  2012. The  credit report also listed a $5,242 state tax  lien that was
filed  in   2011.1   Applicant   discussed  his  tax   issues  when  he  was  interviewed  for   his
background investigation in July 2013. (Tr. at 48-50; GE 3, 5)
Applicant did not file his federal and state income tax returns when they were due
for tax years 2012 through 2017, and he did not pay all the taxes owed for those years
when  they  were  due.  He  stated  that  he  bought  a  house  in  another  state  in  2012,  and
during the move, he mistakenly disposed of documents necessary to file the returns. He
also indicated that he underwent cancer surgery and treatment during the period. (Tr. at

Applicant  reported  his  failure  to  file  tax  returns  for  2012  through  2016  on  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that he submitted in March 2018.

file  the returns was that he was “playing to[o] much golf, hunting, [and] fishing - sorry.”

confirmed that he did not file state and federal tax returns and pay all the taxes owed for
tax years 2012 through 2016. He also admitted that he did not file his 2017 federal and
state tax returns, nor did he pay all the taxes owed. He stated that he put off working on
his taxes because he did not want to ask his wife for the paperwork. (Tr. at 31; GE 4)
Applicant hired a tax professional and filed his back federal and state income tax
returns through tax year 2017 in about August or September 2019. His tax professional
attempted  to  negotiate  an  offer  in  compromise  with  the  IRS  for  his  unpaid  taxes.  The
IRS  did  not  accept  the  offer  in  compromise  because  his  income  was  too  high.  In
December 2020, the IRS filed a $39,738 tax lien against Applicant and his wife for tax
years 2013 through 2016. Applicant paid the back taxes for 2013 through 2016, and the
