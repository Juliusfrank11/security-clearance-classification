Applicant is 68 years old. He has been divorced since 1995, and he and his ex-
wife have three adult sons. He obtained a bachelor’s degree in 1981. He has worked as
a senior analyst for defense contractors since 1995, and he has worked for his current
employer  since  February  2009.  He  enlisted  in  the  Air  Force  in  1971  and  received  an
honorable  discharge  in  1983,  when  he  was  commissioned  as  an  officer.  He  retired
honorably in 1994. He has held a security clearance since at least 2008, and he held a
top secret clearance when he served in the Air Force. (Item 4; Item 5; Item 6)
Applicant  admitted that he  failed to  timely file, as required, his 2018 federal income
tax  return. He  denied that he failed to timely file, as required, his 2014 through 2017  state
income tax returns, but admitted to failing to file  his 2018  state income tax  returns in  a
timely manner. He  admitted to owing  the Internal  Revenue  Service (IRS) $9,910.45 for
tax   years  2011,  2013,   2015,  and  2016,  but  claimed  he  entered  into  a  repayment
agreement with the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS) in  January 2018. In his December
2019 answer  to the SOR, Applicant  claimed he was paying $1,000 monthly, but  he did
not include  proof of any payments. Finally, he admitted to gambling losses of $65,000,
which   caused  him  to  fall  behind   on  his  mortgage  and  other  financial  obligations,  but
claimed he had stopped gambling. (Item  1; Item 3)
In his August 2018 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed that
he failed to pay his federal income taxes for tax years 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017.
He also disclosed that he was almost $20,000 delinquent on his mortgage. He fell behind
on his mortgage and tax obligations due to gambling losses and helping family members
with their finances. He averaged his gambling losses to be $10,000 a year for an unstated
number of years. Applicant claimed he was working with the IRS to establish a repayment
agreement, and he was working with his mortgage holder to reach a loan modification
agreement. Because Applicant’s delinquent mortgage debt was not included in the SOR
as a separate allegation, I will consider it only in relation to his gambling losses and to
evaluate mitigation and the whole person concept. (Item 4 at 32-28)
During  his  December  2018  and  January  2019  personal  subject  interviews  (SI),
Applicant  told  the  government  investigator  information  consistent  with  his  SCA
disclosures. He gambled to try and increase his funds, and his gambling caused financial
issues between January 2012 and August 2018. He needed additional funds because of
the financial help he provided to his family. He told the Government investigator that there
is no chance he would gamble in the future due to the problems gambling had caused
him. He provided the Government investigator copies of February 2016 and November
2018 loan modification agreements for his primary mortgage. (Item 6)
In  his  July  2019  response  to  CAF  interrogatories,  Applicant  included  Internal
Revenue  Service  (IRS)  tax  transcripts  for  tax  years  2011  through  2017  and  state
transcripts for tax years 2011 through 2013. The state transcripts did not indicate when
he filed the relevant returns, but Applicant asserted that his state income tax returns were
filed every year with his federal income tax returns. He also claimed he was working with
the IRS to establish a repayment agreement, but he did not provide proof of a current
repayment agreement, past repayment agreements, nor proof of any payments to any of
the  agreements.  Between  2011  and  2019,  Applicant’s  adjusted  gross  income  was
between $141,330 and $174,673. (Item 5, AE A)
Applicant filed his 2011  federal income tax  return on July 16, 2012. The  June 2019
IRS  transcript  reflects  no  evidence   that  he  filed  for  an  extension,  nor   did  he  pay  the
outstanding  taxes  that were  due  at  that time. Additionally, the transcript shows that he
entered into installment agreements in March  2014, September 2014, March  2017, and
January  2018,  but  no  payments  were  made.  In  his  response   to  the  FORM,  Applicant
provided  an  August  2020   tax   transcript,  reflecting  an  outstanding   balance  of  $.03.  His
payments totaling $1,343.79 were made between April  and  July 2020.  (Item 5 at 9-11;
AE A at 4-5, 37)
Applicant filed his 2012 federal income tax return on May 13, 2013, and his tax
transcript reflects no evidence that he filed for an extension. He overpaid his taxes, and
the residue of $654 was applied to tax year 2007. (Item 5 at 12-13)
Applicant filed his 2013 federal income tax  return on June 2, 2014.  The  June 2019
IRS  transcript  reflects  no  evidence   that  he  filed  for  an  extension,   nor   did  he  pay  the
outstanding taxes that were  due  at  that time.  Additionally, the transcript shows that he
entered into installment agreements in  September 2014, March 2017,  and  January 2018,
but no payments were  made. In  his response to  the  FORM, Applicant provided an August
2020 tax  transcript,  reflecting an outstanding balance  of $87.06. His payments totaling
$2,481.80 were made  between June  and  August 2020. (Item 5 at 14-16; AE  A at 7-8, 37)
Applicant filed his 2014 federal income tax return on August 3, 2015, and his tax
transcript reflects no evidence that he filed for an extension. He overpaid his taxes, and
the residue of $90 was applied to tax year 2002. (Item 5 at 17-19; AE A at 9-15)
Applicant filed his 2015 federal income tax  return on February 27, 2017. The  June
2019 IRS transcript reflects no evidence that he filed for  an extension,  nor did he pay the
outstanding taxes that were  due  at  that time.  Additionally,  the transcript shows that he
entered into installment agreements in  March 2017 and January 2018, but no  payments
were made. In his response to the FORM, Applicant  was unable to provide  an updated
tax  transcript, nor  did he provide  evidence of payments  toward the  outstanding  balance
of  $2,776.95.  (Item 5 at 20-22; AE at 16-22)
Applicant filed his 2016 federal income tax  return on July 2, 2018. The  June 2019
IRS  transcript  reflects  no  evidence   that  he  filed  for  an  extension,   nor   did  he  pay  the
outstanding taxes that were  due  at  that time.  Additionally, the transcript shows that he
entered  into  an  installment  agreement  in   June  2018,  but  made  no  payments.  In  his
response to  the  FORM, Applicant  provided an August  2020 tax  transcript,  reflecting an
outstanding balance of $3,653.91. He  entered into an additional  installment agreement in
November 2019, but did not provide proof of payments. (Item 5 at 23-24; AE at 23-24)
Applicant filed his 2017 federal income tax return on March 25, 2019, and there is
no evidence that he filed for an extension. He overpaid his taxes, and the residue of $177
was applied to tax year 2002. (Item 5 at 17-19; AE A at 25-31)
Applicant  indicated  in  his  September  2020  response  to  the  FORM  that  the  IRS
sent him a  letter informing him  that it  has an open identity theft  case for tax  years 2014,
2015, and  2017. As a  result, he  could not submit updated account transcripts for these
tax   years;  however,  he  did  not  provide   a  copy  of  the  IRS  letter.  Additionally,  in  his
response to the FORM, Applicant  provided a copy of his 2018  IRS tax  transcript. Applicant
filed his 2018 federal income tax  return on September 16, 2019, and there is no evidence
that he filed  for an extension, despite his assertions in  his answer to the SOR. Applicant’s
August   2020 tax   transcripts reflects  an   outstanding balance   of   $11,111.24. Applicant’s
failure to pay this tax  debt was not alleged  in the SOR;  therefore,  I will  consider it only to
evaluate mitigation and the whole person concept.  Applicant filed  his 2019  federal  and
state income tax  returns on July 1,  2020,  in  a timely manner,  and  paid  the amount due  to
the IRS. He received a refund from his state. (AE A at 2,  32-33)
In  his  response  to  the  FORM,  Applicant  provided  a  history  of  payment  activity
reflecting all of the payments he made to the IRS in the last five years, not including tax
withholding. There is no evidence that he made any payments before January 2020, when
he started making $1,000 payments. Almost $4,000 of the total payments Applicant made
this  year  were  applied  to  tax  year  2010.  Because  Applicant’s  delinquent  2010  federal
income  taxes  were  not  included  in  the  SOR  as  an  allegation,  I  will  consider  it  only  to
evaluate mitigation and the whole person concept.  Applicant’s state tax  records reflect
that  he  does  not  currently  owe  any  outstanding  income  tax  debts  for  tax  years  2011
through 2019. The records he provided do not demonstrate when the 2011 through 2018
returns were filed. (Item 5; AE A at 37-56)
Despite claims in his January 2019 SI that he had quit gambling and did not intend
to gamble in the future, Applicant admitted in his October 2020 response to the FORM
that “I have not gambled in months….” This statement indicates he continued to gamble
despite  his  declarations  that  he  made  in  his  August  2018  SCA,  January  2019  SI,  and
December 2019 answer to the SOR that he no longer gambled. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 6;
AE A at 2)
Applicant’s January 2020 credit bureau report indicated his mortgage was past due
in the amount of $10,600, and foreclosure proceedings had been initiated. In his FORM
response  he  provided  documentation  demonstrating  he  entered  into  a  trial  mortgage
modification  plan  on  January  31,  2020,  which  became  permanent  in  May  2020.  He
provided proof of an October 1, 2020 automatic draft from his bank account. There is no
evidence in the record that Applicant has obtained credit counseling or currently follows
a written budget. (Item 8; AE A at 57-64)
