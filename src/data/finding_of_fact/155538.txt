Applicant is 49-years-old and has been married to his third wife since 2015. He
has a 26-year-old daughter and 23-year-old son from his first marriage, and his wife has
three  adult  children.  His  23-year-old stepdaughter  resides with  them.  They provide his
son, his 22-year-old stepson, and the above mentioned stepdaughter with some financial
support. Applicant received an associate’s  degree in  1993. He has worked for defense
contractors  almost  continuously  since  1991,  and  he  has  worked  as  an  electronic
technician  for  his  current  employer  since  June  2017.  He  first  applied  for  a  security
clearance in 1991 and has continuously held classified access since 1991. (GE 1; GE 5;
Tr. 11-14, 25-27, 57)
The SOR alleged that Applicant has 16 delinquent debts, totaling $36,523. In his
response to the SOR, he admitted all of the allegations, except SOR ¶ 1.h. Each of the
debts alleged in the SOR were confirmed by Applicant’s three credit bureau reports (CBR)
dated April 2018, April 2019, and March 2021, respectively. (Answer; GE 2; GE 3; GE 4;
GE 5 at 3-5)
Applicant attributed his financial delinquencies primarily to a three-month period of
unemployment  following  his  June  2014  termination.  At  the  time,  he  was  earning
approximately $70,000 a year. He was then was underemployed for the next three years,
and  he  earned  significantly  less  than  he  did  prior  to  his  June  2014  termination.
Additionally, Applicant testified that his 2004 and 2011 divorces, child support obligations,
and the additional financial support he provided to ill family members also contributed to
his financial issues. (GE 1; GE 5; Tr. 21-22, 25, 28-33, 50)
Prior to his 2014 termination, Applicant had missed a few child support payments,
but  none  of  his  debts  had  been  placed  for  collection.  The  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR
became  delinquent  between  July  2014  and  2018.  They  consist  primarily  of  consumer
debts, loans, and credit cards. Applicant also has five outstanding medical bills totaling
$441. (GE 2; GE 3; GE 4; Tr. 29-30, 33-38, 41-45, 51)
After  he  was  fired  in  2014,  Applicant  consulted  with  an  attorney  regarding  his
financial  difficulties.  The  attorney  advised  Applicant  to  focus  on  his  current  bills  rather
than address his debts that had been placed for collection or charged off by creditors.
Shortly after he started working for his current employer, in 2017, Applicant met with a
financial counselor who explained credit to him and credit scores, and they developed a
plan to pay his bills and manage a written budget. As of the hearing, he used Credit Karma
and monitored his credit with the credit bureau agencies. (Tr. 21-22, 38-39, 52-54, 60)
In 2020, Applicant  contacted “a couple of”  the creditors of his smaller debts. He
learned  that  the  outstanding  balances  were  larger  than  he  realized;  therefore,  he
contacted  another  attorney.  This  attorney  recommended  that  Applicant  “stop  the
bleeding” and work within a budget. Shortly thereafter, due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
Applicant’s  wife’s hours were reduced from 40 to 20 or 25 hours a week, reducing her
income to $30,000 annually. Because of her reduced income, they were unable to afford
to address any of their outstanding debts.  (Tr.  21-23, 25-26, 40-42)
Applicant denied SOR ¶1.h. At one time, he had multiple loans with this payday
loan company, and he testified that he had resolved all outstanding loans. In his opinion,
this debt was erroneously reported. As of the hearing, he had not contested it with the
creditor or the credit bureau agencies. (Tr. 43-44, 51-52)
Applicant has made no payments toward any of the alleged debts, but he has no
new  delinquent  debts  or  obligations.  He  owes  approximately  $2,000  to  the  federal
government for unpaid taxes owed from a 401k loan that he took out in 2017. He is not in
a  payment  installment  agreement  with  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS),  but  makes
sporadic payments. His last payment was in 2020. This debt was not alleged in the SOR;
therefore, it is not disqualifying, but it will be considered within the Guideline F mitigation
analysis and whole-person analysis. (Tr. 24, 32-33, 47, 54-55)
Applicant intends to resolve his delinquent debts. At the hearing, he admitted that
paying  his  delinquent  debts  was  not  a  priority  in  the  past,  but  he  recognized  the
importance  of  resolving  his  debts.  Applicant  and  his  wife  are  trying  to  generate  more
income to resolve their outstanding debts. She is looking for another job that has a higher
salary, and he started a real estate business in 2020, but it had not earned any income
as of the hearing date. (Tr. 49, 56-60)
Since June 2017, Applicant has earned approximately $69,000 annually. His wife
is an office manager for a dental practice and currently earns $30,000 annually. He has
approximately $25,000 in his 401k and $50,000 invested in cryptocurrency. Applicant has
a net monthly remainder of $800. (Tr. 26, 32, 40, 46, 50-51, 55)
Applicant provided copies of his 2019 and 2020 work performance evaluations. He
is considered a strong performer and a valued employee. (AE A)
