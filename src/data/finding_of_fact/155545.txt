Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  in  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.d  and  denied  the
allegations  in  ¶¶  1.e  and  1.f.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,
testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  42  years  old.  She  is  a  college  graduate.  She  married  in  2005  and
divorced  in  2019.  She  has  one  child,  age  seven,  from  the  marriage.  She  has  been
employed by her present employer since March 2018. (Tr. 17-19)
In October 2017, Applicant separated from her husband who was participating in
an alcohol and drug rehabilitation program. He left it early and had his girlfriend pick him
up from the location. Applicant was in an abusive marriage and at that point she decided
to leave it. She filed for divorce the same month. Her husband is remarried and has a
new family. Applicant credibly testified that her husband took responsibility in the marriage
for filing their federal and state income tax returns and paying their taxes. She learned
through discovery as part of her divorce that he failed to file their 2015 and 2016 federal
and state tax returns. (Tr. 19-25)
As part of Applicant’s  and  her  husband’s divorce decree, he was ordered to file
their 2015, 2016, and 2017 federal and state tax returns as “married filing jointly.” It was
also ordered that he would be responsible for 60% of the tax liability, and Applicant would
be responsible for the remaining 40%. He did not file the 2015 and 2016 returns until July
2018 and November 2018, respectively. Applicant testified that he prepared the 2017 tax
returns, and she signed them electronically, but he did not file them as so ordered. Later
she learned that he filed them as “single.” (Tr. 19-25; Answer; GE 2)
Applicant’s  attorney  was  forced  to  file  motions  to  show  cause  with  the  court  to
enforce the terms of the divorce decree. The judge subsequently ordered Applicant to file
her 2017 tax returns as “head of household,” which she did in February 2020, immediately
after her court date. She repeatedly contacted the IRS to confirm receipt of her tax returns,
but  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  lockdown  it  was  difficult  to  get  a  response.  In
September 2020, after Applicant’s inquiry, the IRS confirmed it did not receive the returns.
Applicant resent the tax returns by certified mail and receipt was confirmed. (Tr. 23-29;
Answer; GE 2)
Applicant  began  paying  her  share  of  the  delinquent  federal  taxes  for  2015  in
September 2018. She paid the entire federal tax liability. Her ex-husband failed to pay
any of his share. Applicant testified that she repeatedly had to go to court to enforce the
terms of their divorce decree. She believed her ex-husband was aware that her finances
and  tax  liability  would  jeopardize  her  security  clearance,  and  he  was  deliberately  and
intentionally creating financial roadblocks for her to be vindictive. She paid her share of
the  2016  federal  tax  debt,  but  her  ex-husband  failed  to  pay  his  share  until  December
2020. Applicant’s 2015 and 2016 federal tax debts are resolved. (Tr. 19-26, 33-35; AE C,
D)
Applicant  owes  federal  income  taxes  for  2017  in  the  approximate  amount  of
$25,000,  which  includes  penalties  and  interest.  She  explained  the  amount  owed  was
impacted because when she separated from her husband, she was unemployed and had
no money. She withdrew money from her 401K pension plan and incurred the additional
tax liability for early withdrawal. She used this money to support herself and her son. She
did  not  receive  any  child  support  from  her  husband  from  October  2017  until  February
2018. She became employed in March 2018. Applicant timely filed her 2018 and 2019
federal and state income tax returns and her refunds were applied to her tax debts. (Tr.
27-33, 44-46; AE A, B, F)
Applicant entered into an installment agreement with the IRS in October 2020. She
stated  that  direct  withdrawals  were  supposed  to  begin  in  December  2020  or  January
2021, but they did not, so she has been making the required payments  manually. She
stated  that  she  began  making  payments  to  the  IRS  before  she  had  an  installment
agreement because she was aware that she had a tax liability for 2017 that had to be
paid.  She  has  been  pleading  with  her  ex-husband  to  begin  making  his  share  of  the
payments, but he refuses. (Tr. 26-29; AE A, B, F)
Regarding Applicant’s 2015 and 2016 state tax liability, she testified that she paid
those tax liabilities right after the returns were filed. She paid the whole amount owed.
Her ex-husband did not pay his share. She has a payment plan with the state to pay her
2017 state tax liability. She has been making $500 monthly payments since December
2020, and the debt will be completely resolved in May 2021. She timely filed and paid her
2018 and 2019 state income tax returns. Refunds were applied to the balance owed for
past years. (Tr. 35-38; AE E, G)
Applicant testified that she and her ex-husband own two properties, their former
marital residence and a rental property. He lives in the marital residence. In the divorce
decree,  he  was  ordered  to  refinance  the  residence  and  remove  Applicant  from  the
property’s  title.  Applicant  was  ordered to  do the same for the  rental property. She has
maintained  the  mortgage on the  rental property.  He failed to  pay  the  mortgage on the
residence for numerous months and just prior to foreclosure he brought the loan current.
A lien was placed on the property due to his failure to pay his taxes (SOR ¶ 1.b). Because
Applicant’s name is still on the title of the residential property, her husband’s delinquency
in paying the mortgage, has impacted Applicant’s ability to obtain a loan to refinance the
mortgage on the rental property. She discussed her financial situation with a prospective
lender who advised her that she would not be eligible to refinance the rental property loan
until there was 12 months of timely mortgage payments on the marital property. Applicant
has no control over those payments and is frustrated that she cannot resolve the transfer
of ownership on the properties due to her ex-husband’s actions. She intends to refinance
the rental property as soon as she is permitted. (Tr. 39-44)
Applicant credibly testified that she lives within her means and does not have any
other outstanding debts. She has had some financial counseling through her accountant
and  family  to  ensure  that  she  is  proceeding  correctly  in  resolving  her  tax  issues.  She
intends to complete the IRS installment agreement and rebuild her savings. She has a
budget. Prior to her divorce, she had an outstanding credit rating and intends to works
towards rehabilitating it. She does not intend to make any nonessential purchases until
her tax debt is paid. Applicant stated that except for her poor choice in whom she married,
the financial problems were beyond her control, but she is working hard to rectify and pay
the remaining tax owed. (Tr. 38, 46-47)
