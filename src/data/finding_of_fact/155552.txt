Applicant  denied  all the allegations  (except ¶ 1.c, which  was neither admitted  nor
denied). After  a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following  findings of
fact.
Applicant is a 60-year-old employee  of a defense contractor. He began working
for his current employer  in  2009.  He  is a graduate of the U.S. Air  Force Academy and
was commissioned a second  lieutenant upon his graduation in  1982.  He  served in  the
U.S. Air Force  on active duty for  six  years, in  the U.  S.  Air Force Reserve  (AFR)  for six
years,  and   in   the  Air  National   Guard  for  eight  years.  He   retired  after   20  years  of
honorable  service in  2009  as a lieutenant colonel. He  earned a master’s degree in  1989
and  a law degree in  1991.  He  took out student loans while attending law school  and  still
owes  approximately  $60,000  on  those  loans.  He   was  in   private  law  practice  for
approximately  18  years  after  law  school.   The   last   nine  years  of   his  practice   he
specialized  in  bankruptcy  law.  He  has been  an active member of  a state bar  association
for over  30  years.  He  is twice divorced  (most recently in 2018) and has one  adult son
who lives with him.  (Tr. at 7, 21-23, 41-42, 44-45; GE 1-2)
Under Guideline F, the SOR (and subsequent amendment) alleged that in 2008,
Applicant had a state tax lien (state 1) filed against him in the amount of approximately
$3,382; that Applicant failed to file state 1 tax returns for tax years 2008-2009; and that
Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state 2 tax returns for tax years 2010-2012
and 2019 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c).
Under Guideline E, it was alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose a
federal tax lien in the amount of $6,176, entered in May 2010, on his July 2016 security
clearance  application  (SCA);  that  he  deliberately  failed  to  disclose  that  his  wages  had
been  garnished  for  a  debt,  or  that  he  was  over  120  days  delinquent  on  any  debt
previously listed, or that he is currently over 120 days delinquent on any debt on his July
2016 SCA;  and that he provided false or misleading information on his February 2008
SCA  when  he  affirmatively  responded  that  he  had  been  over  180  days  delinquent  on
any  debts  and  that  he  was  currently  over  90  days  delinquent  on  any  debt,  and  listed
those debts as student loans in the amount of $72,000. In July 2008, Applicant filed a
Chapter  7  bankruptcy  petition  listing  unsecured  non-priority  claims  of  over  $500,000,
including  medical,  consumer,  and  non-educational  debt  of  approximately  $173,000,
none of which was earlier reported on his February 2008 SCA. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.c).
Applicant’s current financial difficulties began in approximately 2008, although he
had  received  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  discharge  in  1997.  In  2008,  he  was  engaged  in
the private practice of law in state 1. He also was earning income from his AFR position,
which  was  subject  to  state  1  income  tax.  He  decided  to  file  for  bankruptcy  in  2008
because  he  wanted  to  dissolve  his  law  practice,  close  his  related  credit-counseling
business, and his real-estate business. Applicant claimed these actions were necessary
because  of  a  dispute  he  had  with  his  real-estate  business  partner.  He  claimed  the
partner  was  expending  business  funds  for  non-business  purposes.  When  Applicant
confronted  his  partner  about  his  actions and indicated  he was  going to  report  it  to  the
police, Applicant claims the partner threatened his and his family’s lives. Rather than go
to  the  police,  Applicant  decided  to  close  up  his  businesses,  file  for  bankruptcy
protection, and move to state 2. (Tr. at 24-26)
Applicant claims that the 2008-2009 time frame was tumultuous for him because
of  closing  down  his  businesses,  going  through  bankruptcy,  moving  to  state  2,  and
starting  a  new  job.  He  offers  this  as  a  partial  explanation  for  his  state  and  federal  tax
issues at the time. (Answer to SOR (Ans.))
The status of Applicant’s financial issues is as follows:
State  1  Tax  Lien Indebtedness,  May 2008-$3,382.  Documentation  shows  that
on  May  14,  2008,  a  lien  was  filed  in  the  amount  of  $3,382  by  the  Department  of
Revenue for state 1 against Applicant. The document also shows that the notice of lien
was addressed to Applicant’s then-business address in state 1. Applicant claims he did
not receive this notice and it was not forwarded to state 2, where he relocated in June
2009. He testified that he did not become aware of the lien until receiving interrogatories
from  the  Government  in  August  and  November  2019.  Despite  being  a  bankruptcy
attorney  and  running  a  credit-counseling  business,  he  claims  he  did  not  run  a  credit
report to see if it listed any liens. After issuance of the SOR in January 2020, Applicant
contacted the tax authorities in state 1 and confirmed the lien and the underlying state
income tax debt. He documented a payment of $4,150 (including penalty) to state 1, but
he is unconvinced that he legally owed the state the money. (Tr. 30-33; GE 1, 3, 4, 8;
Ans.)
Untimely Filings of Applicant’s 2008 and 2009 state 1 tax returns. Applicant
testified that he simply forgot about his 2008 return because it was when he was closing
down  his  businesses  and  moving.  He  testified  that  he  did  not  believe  he  had  income
from state 1 in 2009 and therefore he did not need to file a state return. He forgot about
his  AFR  income  which  derived  from  state  1  and  was  therefore  taxable.  In  the  earlier
interrogatories submitted to Applicant, he stated that he was convinced he had filed his
2008 and 2009 state tax returns. However, he had not filed either return when they were
due.  He  presented  documentation  showing  that  both  returns  were  not  filed  until
February 2020. (Tr. 33-35; GE 4; Ans.)
Untimely Filings of Applicant’s 2010-2012 and 2019 federal tax returns. Tax
account transcripts supplied by the Applicant in response to Government interrogatories
reflect  that  for  tax  year  2010,  Applicant  failed  to  file  his  own  tax  return  by  the  filing
deadline. This is established because the IRS filed a substitute tax return in May 2013.
When asked about this at hearing, Applicant stated he could not really explain how this
happened.  Additional  tax  account  transcripts  for  tax  years  2011  and  2012  show  that
both years’ returns were filed in April 2014, which was untimely for both years. Applicant
admitted in his testimony that these filed federal returns, as well as his state tax returns
for  the  same  period,  were  untimely.  Applicant  was  asked  if  he  had  other  unfiled  tax
returns. He admitted that his 2019 federal and state tax returns had yet to be filed. The
IRS  extended  the  filing  deadline  from  April  15  to  July  15,  2020,  for  tax  year  2019
because of COVID-19. Any requested filing extensions until October 15, 2020, also had
to be filed by July 15, 2020 (See https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/coronavirus-tax-relief-
filing-and-payment-deadlines).  Applicant  explained  that  his  father  had  passed  away
during  the  past  year  and  he  was  back  in  his  home  state  for  eight  weeks  settling  his
father’s  affairs  and  he  forgot  to  file  his  returns.  He  was  going  to  get  information  to  his
accountant so he could get those returns filed quickly. He was given the opportunity to
supplement the record by showing when he actually filed his returns, but he failed to do
so. (Tr. at 99-105; GE 3)
Applicant  stated   that  the  reason  he  did  not  list  the  2010  federal  tax   lien  on  his
2016  SCA  was  because  he  was  unaware  of  the   lien  at  that  time.  A  federal   tax   lien  is
listed on Applicant’s September 2016 credit report. In his 2008 SCA, Applicant listed a
federal  tax  lien  from  2003.  A  review  of  his  tax   transcript  for   year  2016  shows  that  he
received a $10,000 tax  refund, which  would  have  been captured by the IRS to  pay any
lien  amount  if   it   was  still   owed.  These  facts  tend  to  corroborate  Applicant’s   assertion
that he was unaware of a federal  tax  lien when he completed his  2016 SCA. (Tr. at  36-
37, 82, 86; GE 2, 3)
In Section 26 of his July 2016 SCA, Applicant was asked inter alia, “In the past
seven years, have you had your wages . . . garnished for any reason? In the past seven
years,  have  you  been  over  120  days  delinquent  on  any  debt  not  previously  entered?
You  are  currently  over  120  days  delinquent  on  any  debt?”  He  responded  by  checking
the “no” option. Applicant’s wages were garnished beginning in August 2018, which was
after he completed his SCA. Therefore, the garnishment question above is not at issue.
However,  Applicant  believed  the  garnishment  was  based  upon  his  delinquent  student
loans. He explained that he held both government-guaranteed loans and privately-held
loans  totally  approximately  $75,000  for  his  law  school  education.  He  claimed  that  he
has paid the government-backed loans since 2009 (up until the COVID-19 deferment).
He  further  stated  that  he  has  not  made  payments  on  the  private  loans  because  the
loans have been bought and sold by so many creditors he could not get any accounting
of  what  he  owed.  He  did  not  start  paying  on  these  private  student  loans  until  the
garnishment took place. He  listed his student loans in  his 2008 SCA. He  believed “no”
was  the  correct  answer  to  the  2016  SCA  because  he  was  paying  his  government-
backed student loans and the status of his private-based student loans was unknown by
him. (Tr. at 73-81; GE 2, 3, 5; Ans.)
Applicant  explained  why,  in  response  to  Section  28  of  his  February  2008  SCA,
he listed  delinquent debts of $72,000 consisting of student  loans, but in July 2008, he
reported  over  $500,000  in  unsecured  non-priority  claims  when  he  filed  his  Chapter  7
bankruptcy  petition.  Applicant  stated  that  because  he  practiced  bankruptcy  law,  he
knew the best practice was to list any possible liability in  his petition to ensure that all
dischargeable  liabilities  would  be  discharged.  That  meant  listing  debts  that  were  not
delinquent  at  the  time  he  filed  his  bankruptcy.  An  example  of  this  was  his  listing  of  a
$100,000  contingency  debt  to  his  former  business  partner  who  threatened  to  sue
Applicant. No debt was owed, but he listed it in his petition to protect him from a future
claim  by  the  partner.  A  completed  breakdown  of  Applicant’s  debts  listed  in  his
bankruptcy  as  to  the  type  of  debt  and  when  they  were  delinquent  is  listed  in  his  SOR
answer.  Additionally,  Applicant  did  not  run  a  credit  report  before  completing  his  2008
SCA, but he did run one before he completed his bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 37-39, 65-72;
GE 1, 2, 6; Ans.)
