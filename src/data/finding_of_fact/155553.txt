Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for
her  current  employer  since  2007.  She  has  an  associate’s  degree  that  she  earned  in
2016. She is married with three children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 23-24; GE 1)
Applicant’s  husband  had  a  heart  attack  in  2015.  He  was  in  the  hospital  for
several  months  and  out  of  work  for  months  after  his  release.  Applicant  became
overwhelmed, and some things, including her taxes, were not addressed. (Tr. at 17-18;
GE 2)
Applicant and her husband filed their 2015 federal and state income tax returns
on time, but they did not pay all of the federal taxes that were due. IRS records indicate
their tax liability was $3,709; $2,322 was withheld from their pay; and they had a credit
of $520; leaving a balance of about $867. (Tr. at 18-20; Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 3, 4; AE A-B)
Applicant and her husband  did  not  file  their  2016  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns when they were due, and they did not pay all of the federal taxes that were due.
Applicant  and  her  husband  filed  their  2016  federal  and  state  tax  returns  in  about
October 2019. They established a $250 per month installment agreement with the IRS
in  January  2020,  with  the  first  payment  made  in  March  2020  by  automatic  debit  from
their  account.  The  installment  plan  covered  taxes  owed  for  2015,  2016,  and  an
additional tax year or years. Applicant established that she made every $250 payment
as required ($3,250 through April 15, 2021). She no longer owes for 2015. In May 2021,
with  penalties  and  interest,  the  balance  owed  the  IRS  for  2016  was  $4,708.  She
estimated  her  total  federal  tax  liability  to  be  about  $12,000.  (Tr.  at  18-23;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1-4; AE A-D)
Applicant  accepted  responsibility  for  her  tax  failures.  All  tax  returns  except  for
2016 have been filed on time. She is current on her state taxes. She credibly stated that
all future tax returns will be filed on time, and she will continue with her IRS installment
plan until all of her back taxes are paid. (Tr. at 18-23)
