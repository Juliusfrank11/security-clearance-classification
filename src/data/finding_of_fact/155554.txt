Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the  pleadings,  including  Applicant’s  admissions  in  his  Answer  to  all  six  of  the  SOR
allegations,  his  testimony,  and  the  documentary  evidence  in  the  record,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant,  40,  has  been  employed  by  a  U.S.  Government  contractor  as  an
assessment  director  since  November  2018.  He  has  never  been  married  and  has  no
children. In 2006,  he earned a bachelor’s degree. His December 2018 SCA is his first
application for a security clearance. (Tr. at 24-27, 60.)
Financial Considerations
Applicant  first  experienced  financial  problems  in  2016  or  2017  when  the  IRS
audited his 2011 and 2012 income tax returns and determined that he owed $17,000 in
unpaid taxes. Applicant paid the tax debt by borrowing the funds from a bank. He noted
an  error  in  the  summary  of  his  February  17,  2019  background  interview  (GE  2)  that
reported he said that this loan was used to pay for courses in stock-option trading. The
Government’s credit reports in the record reflect that this loan was opened in February
2017. (Tr. at 64-65; GE 2 at 3; GE 3 at 4.)
As explained below,  Applicant  opened a number  of credit-card accounts  in July
2017  to  pay  for  educational  courses  in  get-rich-quick  schemes.  His  financial  problems
worsened in March 2018. Applicant purchased a Bitcoin option for $250 from a foreign
online trading operation that advertised on social media. Within a month, the online trader
reported that the value of Applicant’s investment had grown to almost $100,000. At one
point in his testimony, Applicant said that he invested additional money into his Bitcoin
account,  which  partially  explained  the  astronomical  growth  of  his  modest  initial
investment. Applicant sought to withdraw his money and was advised that he needed to
pay  $7,000  and  subsequently,  another  $4,000  in  “transaction  taxes.”  He  paid  these
amounts, but stopped when more was demanded. He never received anything from this
investment. He believes that he was the victim of a scam. (Tr. at 32-40, 53, 58, 64.)
Applicant overdrew his line of credit with a credit union to make the two payments,
totaling $11,000. He testified that he panicked and sought the advice of a credit counselor,
which was in fact a credit-consolidation company. The counselor recommended that he
strategically default on repaying the line of credit and all of his other debts even though
he could afford to pay these debts. The “strategy” behind this advice was that the credit
counselor would use the defaults as leverage over the creditors to negotiate repayment
terms  for  less  than  the  amounts  of  the  individual  debts,  thereby  reducing  his  debts.
Applicant was required to pay $689 per month to the debt-consolidation firm. Part of these
payments were fees to the company and the balance was to be used to pay his debts
over time. He followed this advice and stopped paying his debts in mid-2018. As it turned
out, most of Applicant’s payments was applied to the counselor’s fees. None of the money
was paid to a creditor. Applicant recognizes now that his strategic default on his debts
was a mistake since he could have simply used this money to pay his debts. (Tr. at 32-
40, 61-63.)
In  January  2019,  Applicant  switched  to  a  different  financial  counselor  who  only
charged him $89 per month. For these fees, this counselor has disputed Applicant’s debts
and in the future will negotiate with his creditors to seek a reduction in the amounts owed
and payment plans to pay the debts over time. Applicant has not repaid any of his debts
through this new counselor. More recently, he has been primarily focused on attempting
to generate additional income through a side business venture to pay down his debts. (Tr.
at 32-40.)
The Six Admitted Debts Listed in the SOR
SOR  ¶  1.a,  Bank  Loan  Charged  Off  in  the  Amount  of  $18,447.  Applicant  used  the
funds from this loan to pay his tax debt for tax years 2011 and 2012. He defaulted on the
loan in May 2018. The bank charged the debt off in the amount of $17,607 in October
2018. After the hearing, Applicant developed a plan with the advice of his second credit
counselor  to  resolve  his  debts  (the  Plan).  He  submitted  the  Plan  with  his  other  post-
hearing evidentiary submissions. With respect to this debt, he writes in the Plan that he
will  pursue  a  pending  lawsuit  in  which  he  contests  the  validity  of  this  debt  under  the
Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). He provided no evidence showing
the legal basis for this claim. He submitted a discovery request and an email from a lawyer
regarding  a  dispute  with  a  collection  agency  and  two  lenders  unrelated  to  the  creditor
identified in this SOR allegation. The claim made in the documents may be asserted under
the FDCPA, but the documents do not specifically refer to the FDCPA. The exhibits do
not show that this evidence related to the bank loan referenced in SOR ¶ 1.a or what the
basis  of  the  claim  was  with  respect  to this  specific  debt.  Also,  Applicant  did not testify
about a legal claim he was pursuing in defense of this creditor’s debt or that there was a
pending lawsuit regarding this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 28, 65; AE D, E,
H.)
SOR  ¶   1.b,   Credit   Union  Line  of  Credit   Charged  Off  in  the  Amount  of  $17,870.
Applicant opened this checking account line of credit in July 2017  with a limit of $15,000.
He  overdrew the  line of credit when he paid  “transaction taxes”  to the Bitcoin trader.  He
defaulted  on  this  debt  in   October  2018.  The   credit  union  charged  off   the  debt  in   the
amount of $17,865.  Under Applicant’s  November 2, 2020 Plan, he  will repay one  debt at
a time starting with the smallest debts first. At a future date, he  hopes that his counselor
can  negotiate  a  payment  plan  to  repay  this   debt  in   the  amount  of  $7,146.  Applicant
provided no basis to support this figure in his Plan  as a realistic and possible  settlement.
No  payments have  been made as of the close of the record  because Applicant lacks the
necessary funds. The  timing of the  commencement of  any future payments is unknown
at this time.  This debt is not resolved.  (Tr. at 42-43; GE 3 at 4; GE 6 at 5; AE E.)
SOR ¶  1.c, Credit  Union Credit-Card Account Charged Off in the Amount of $8,205.
Applicant opened this credit-card account in  July 2017. He  last paid on this account in
May 2018. The  credit union charged  off  the debt in  the amount of  $8,205. Under the Plan,
Applicant  began   paying  this  debt  with  a  $100  payment   on  November  3,   2020,   to  the
creditor’s collection agency. He  is scheduled  to continue paying $100  per month for  the
next  five   months.   In  his  Plan,  Applicant  claims  that  the  creditor  will  or  has  accepted  a
repayment of this  debt in  the total amount  of  $3,282. The  figure of  $3,282 is the amount
of a settlement offer  set forth in  a letter from the credit union dated May 12,  2020,  for  a
one-time,  immediate payment. Alternatively, the credit union  offered to accept “minimum
payments  of  $82   a  month  until   the  entire   balance   is  repaid.”  (Emphasis  added.)
Applicant offered no evidence  that the credit union has accepted monthly payments of
$100  on  the  reduced  amount  of  $3,282.  After  the  hearing,  Applicant  has  made  one
payment of  $100. This debt is  not resolved.  (Tr. at  44-46; GE 3 at  5; GE 6 at  3-4; AE  E,
F, J.)
SOR ¶ 1.d, Credit-Card Account Charged Off in the Amount of $8,149. In July 2017,
Applicant opened this credit-card account. He defaulted on the account in October 2018.
The creditor subsequently charged off the account in the amount of $8,149 and filed a
lawsuit to collect the debt. Applicant does not list this debt in his Plan. Instead, he provided
a  legal  pleading,  dated  July  29,  2020,  in  which  his  defense  attorney  “requested”  the
dismissal  of  the  lawsuit  “without  prejudice.”  Neither  the  pleading  nor  Applicant’s  post-
hearing submission explains the basis for this request. The record is silent regarding the
current status of this lawsuit. Applicant made no mention of this lawsuit in his testimony
regarding this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 46-47; GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 2; AE
E.)
SOR  ¶   1.e,   Credit-Card  Account  Charged  Off  in   the  Amount  of   $6,871.   Applicant
opened  this credit-card account in  July 2017. He  defaulted on the account in  February
2019. The creditor subsequently  charged off  the account in  the amount of $6,871. In the
Plan, Applicant comments that his credit counselor “will help negotiate [a]  payment plan
with [this creditor.]” This debt is not resolved.  (Tr. at 47-48; GE 3 at 5;  GE 4 at 2;  GE 5
at 2; GE 6 at 2; AE E.)
SOR ¶  1.f,  Collection Account in the amount of $5,178.  Applicant  opened  this credit-
card  account  in   July   2017.  He   defaulted  in  February  2019.  The   creditor  charged  the
account off in  the amount of  $5,184 and  transferred it  to  a  collection agency. The  most
recent credit report in  the record  reflects a  debt of  $5,178. Applicant’s Plan comments
that this debt, as with the one  listed in  SOR ¶  1.e,  will  be the subject of future  negotiations
of   a  payment  plan.  The   collection   agency   has  recently  made  a  settlement  offer   to
Applicant. This debt is not resolved.  (Tr. at  51-52; GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 3; GE
6 at 2, AE E.)
Applicant testified that he opened several of the listed credit-card accounts in July
2017. He used the credit to pay for courses in various entrepreneurial areas that he hoped
to pursue to increase his income above the $77,000 annual income he earns working for
his clearance sponsor. He explained that he “had shiny object syndrome” at that time. He
acknowledged that he “overleveraged” his credit cards while attempting to find a business
venture that would quickly make him rich. He spent a substantial portion of his new credit-
card debt of about $25,000 on these courses in 2017 and 2018. He figured he would pay
off this new debt with the profits from his new business venture. He described the courses
as “mentorships” in which he learned marketing, sales, and professional communication.
He  claims  that  he  learned  valuable  new  skills  that  he  is  using  now  in  his  real  estate
brokering business. (Tr. at 47-51, 55.)
The subjects of the courses varied from online retail sales to life insurance sales
to  wholesale  real  estate  brokering.  He  is  currently  pursuing  a  second  career  in  the
wholesale  real  estate  business  and  has  earned  his  first  fee  “flipping”  contracts  to
purchase homes and reselling the contracts to other buyers. He earned $2,500 on this
transaction, which he hopes to duplicate with more and larger transactions. Applicant took
a mentorship course in May 2019 to learn about this business opportunity. He pays an
assistant $60 per week to identify potential real estate purchases. His business model
depends on two prerequisites, one, finding properties that are not listed for sale and can
be bought cheaply, and two being able to resell the purchase contracts to a third party at
a  profit  so  he  does  not  have  to  purchase  and  own  the  property  or  default  on  the
transaction. He did not explain this plan in detail, but he may pre-sell the sales contract
to a buyer before he contracts to purchase a home to reduce the risk. Applicant testified
that he expects to make significant additional income with this business that he can use
to pay his debts more quickly in the future. Like all of his other businesses, starting with
the Bitcoin investment, they appear to be “get rich quick” schemes that may or may not
actually produce any significant income. Applicant testified that he does not gamble. His
business activities have produced little income to date. (Tr. at 27-32, 47-59.)
Character Reference
Applicant submitted a character reference letter written by a member of his church.
The  writer  has  known  Applicant  since  2007.  She  commented  that  Applicant  has  been
active in a number of their church’s outreach programs that benefit their community and
far beyond. She describes Applicant as “an  honest,  reliable hardworking Christian that
values integrity  and  humanity,”  as  well  as a  person of  good character,  integrity,  and  a
“good heart.” (AE C.)
