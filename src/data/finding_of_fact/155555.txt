Applicant admitted all three SOR allegations (¶¶ 1.a-1.c) with her Answer, which
included  a
lengthy  narrative  statement.  Her  admissions  and  statements  are
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and the record evidence submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  48  years old.  She  has two adult  daughters,  who live with  her. Both
are  gainfully  employed.  Applicant  and  her  husband  are  legally  separated  as  of
December 2014. (Tr. 114-116; AE E) Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in 2017, and
a master’s degree in 2019. (Tr. 43-44, 114; GE 1; AE I)
Applicant  has  worked  as  a  federal  contractor  since  1993,  though  with  certain
periods  of  unemployment  between  contracts.  She  worked  with  the  Department  of
Justice  for  about  10  years,  until  2003.  She  was  a  contractor  with  the  Department  of
Homeland Security for 12 years, from September 2003 to September 2015. She earned
a  salary  of  about  $100,000  in  that  job.  She  was  laid  off  when  her  employer  lost  its
contract. (Tr. 15-16, 42-46, 56-57, 123; Answer; AE A-AE D; GE 1, GE 12)
Applicant  was  unemployed  until  December  2015.  She  then  worked  as  a
contractor  for  the  Department  of  the  Navy,  at  a  much  lower  salary  ($36,000)  until
December  2016.  After  another  layoff,  she  was  then  unemployed  until  February  2017.
Since  then,  she  has  worked  as  a  State  Department  contractor.  Her  current  salary  is
$70,000.  She  has  had  a  clearance  for  over  20  years,  and  is  seeking  to  retain  it.
(Answer; Tr. 15-16, 45-48, 57-59, 62; GE 1)
On her most recent SCA, Applicant disclosed bankruptcy petitions that she filed
in 2011 and 2018. (GE 1 at 35-36) She noted that most of her debts were student loans
related to her daughters’ college expenses. (GE 1 at 40, 42)
The  three  SOR  allegations  concern  two  of  Applicant’s  recent  bankruptcies,  in
2011  and  2019,  and  an  earlier  bankruptcy,  in  1996.  (GE  3,  GE  4,  GE  6)  (A  2018
bankruptcy petition, filed under Chapter 13 and later dismissed, was not alleged).
Applicant attributed the 1996 bankruptcy to youth and  inexperience.  She said  she
purchased   a  car  she  could  not  afford  and   got  “way  over  my  head”  financially.  (Tr.  48,
65)   The   Chapter  7  bankruptcy  was  filed  in  September  1996  and   was  discharged  in
December 1996. (GE 6)(SOR ¶ 1.a)
Applicant matured and later married, but her marriage was troubled and abusive.
Her husband was an authorized user of many of their accounts, and she was not aware
of their financial issues as she should have been. Her husband assumed responsibility
for their  mortgage,  and she did not  learn of  their financial troubles  until the  home was
nearing foreclosure. This led to the second bankruptcy. Her financial stability improved
after  that,  through  her  gainful  employment  as  a  government  contractor.  She  also
furthered  her  education  and  provided  financial  support  so  her  daughters  could  do  the
same. (Answer)
Applicant testified that her husband had been on workers’ compensation after an
accident  at  work  as  a  city  bus  driver  in  about  1999,  and  he  retired  from  the  transit
authority in 2006. The loss of his full second income contributed to the family’s financial
woes,  as  did  their  eventual  marital  separation.  Applicant  was  also  paying  the  living
expenses and college expenses of their two daughters. She testified that the passing of
both her parents also contributed to her financial instability. (Answer; Tr. 48-50, 55 GE
7, GE 8, GE 12 at 26-28; GE 13)
Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2011 after seeking advice on how to
save  her  home  from  foreclosure.  In  that  bankruptcy  petition,  she  disclosed  several
hundred  thousand  dollars  of  debts,  including  almost  $600,000  in  mortgages  and  over
$150,000  in  student  loans.  The  bankruptcy  was  discharged  in  August  2011.  (Answer;
GE 7, GE 8) (SOR ¶ 1.b)
Applicant’s  financial  problems  continued.  She  attributed  her  more  recent  issues
to her 2015 job loss and subsequent loss of income. In late 2016, Applicant retained a
debt-relief company to assist in regaining financial stability. (AE F) She paid them over
$1,000 a month in fees for several months, and over $8,000 total, but this did little good.
She  no  longer  retains  them.  (Answer;  AE  F-AE  H;  Tr.  43,  111,  117-119)  She  also
participated in credit counseling during her bankruptcies. (Tr. 113, 119-120) She keeps
a written budget and has learned to stay within it. (Tr. 64, 138-139)
In  September  2018,  Applicant  filed  for  bankruptcy  under  Chapter  13,  but  that
bankruptcy  petition  was  later  dismissed.  (Tr.  53-54,  83-89;  GE  9)  In  May  2019,
Applicant refiled for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. (Tr. 91-99; GE 10, GE 11) (SOR ¶ 1.c)
She reported about $488,000 in liabilities. Of those, over $384,000 were student loans.
She also disclosed numerous consumer debts. (GE 11 at 9-10, 21-35)
In  her  most  recent  bankruptcy.  Applicant  reported  limited  available  assets  in
checking and savings accounts. (GE 11 at 13) She listed her gross monthly income as
$5,241,  with  monthly  take-home  pay  of  $4,110.  (GE   11  at  39-40)  Her  listed  monthly
expenses  totaled  over  $5,300,   a  monthly  deficit  of   over  $1,200.  (GE   11   at   41-42)
Applicant’s most recent bankruptcy was discharged in August 2019. (GE 10)
Applicant has a history of purchasing expensive cars. In 2007, she purchased a
luxury vehicle for about $60,000. The car was in an accident in 2011. At the time, she
owed about $15,000 in car payments that she could not afford. (Tr. 69-71; GE 13 at 3)
In  2013,  after  her  second  bankruptcy  discharge,  Applicant  purchased  a  used
luxury vehicle for about $41,000. The car was voluntarily repossessed in 2015 after she
lost her job. She owed about $19,000 in payments at the time. (Tr. 81- 83; GE 2 at 6,
GE  4  at  7)  In  2016  she  replaced  it  with  another  used  high-end  vehicle  costing  about
$30,000. In 2019, before filing her most recent bankruptcy, she purchased another high-
end automobile for about $30,000. She has a $767 monthly car payment. (Tr. 61, 101-
103; GE 3 at 3)
Applicant  also  has  several  hundred  thousand  dollars  in  outstanding  student
loans. (GE 3 at 2) She estimated that about half of the student-loan amount was for her
own education, and half was for her daughters’ education. Applicant knows that student
loan  debt  is  not  dischargeable  in  bankruptcy.  She  testified  that  repayment  of  those
loans  is  currently  deferred  by  the  creditors  because  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  (Tr.
104-108, 124-125)
Applicant  believes
that  many  of  her
to
circumstances  beyond  her  control,  such  as  her  difficult  marriage,  her  job  layoffs,  and
her  drop  in  income.  She  wants  to  improve  her  credit  and  does  not  want  to  repeat  her
past  financial  mistakes.  She  is  now  more  conscious  of  her  budget  and  her  spending.
