Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  her  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the  pleadings,  including  Applicant’s  statements  in  her  Answer,  and  the  documentary
evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant, age 60, is a property administrator for a DoD contractor. She has worked
for this contractor since 1985. She has a high school education and has been married to
her current husband since 1989. She has an adult child from a prior marriage.
In  response  to  a  Government  interrogatory,  Applicant  provided  her  federal  tax
transcripts  for   the  years  2012   through  2018.   The   transcripts  reflect  that  she  and   her
husband  had  a  joint adjusted gross  income (AGI) in  tax  year  (TY) 2012 of  over  $319,000.
In  subsequent  years,  their  AGI  was  much  lower,   ranging  from  $205,725  in  2013,  to
$146,620  in  2018.  During  TYs  2012  through  2014,  the  couple  under   withheld   on  their
incomes in significant  amounts and incurred substantial  federal tax  liabilities.  The  SOR
alleges that the liabilities were: ¶  1.a - $13,879 (TY 2012), ¶  1.b - $19,192 (TY  2013), and
¶  1.c  - $25,314 (TY 2014). The SOR also alleges tax liabilities of ¶  1.d - $564 (TY 2016),
¶  1.e - $4,896 (TY 2017), and  ¶  1.f  - $14  (TY 2018). The  record reflects that Applicant
paid all of her taxes due  for  TY 2015 at the time she filed her taxes, so the SOR contains
no allegation regarding  that tax  year. Applicant’s  total  federal tax  liability during the six
tax years alleged in the SOR  was about $64,000. (GE 4.)
The  SOR  also  alleges  a  credit-card  debt  that  was  charged  off  in the  amount  of
$5,546 (SOR ¶ 1.g) and a past-due amount of $746 on a credit card with a balance of
$3,487 (SOR ¶ 1.h). In addition, the SOR alleges an unpaid medical debt of $59 (SOR ¶
1.i)
The  July  2019   federal   tax   transcript  for  TY  2012  reflects  that  Applicant  and   her
husband  have been making monthly payments on installment plans from  2013  to at least
July  2019.  Their  federal  tax   liability  however,  has  not  significantly  decreased   due   to
interest accruing on their debt. In her Answer, Applicant asserted that on March 3 and 5,
2020,  about  one   month   after   the date of the  SOR,  she   paid the  IRS about  $64,227 to
settle  her tax  liabilities for  TY 2012 through 2014 and  2016. The  specific amounts  paid
for  each  year were as follows: ¶  1.a - $12,677 (TY 2012), ¶  1.b - $19,671 (TY 2013), ¶
1.c - $25,943 (TY 2014) and ¶1.d - $6,936 (TY  2016). (GE 4;  AE A through D.)
Applicant also wrote in her Answer that her tax debt for TY 2017 was fully paid
“that same year” as was her small debt for TY 2018. The July 25, 2019 tax transcript for
TY 2017 does not reflect that payment. With her Answer, she provided evidence from the
IRS showing her payments for TY 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2016, but nothing for TYs 2017
and 2018. Applicant’s evidence regarding the debt of $4,896 for TY 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.e) is
incomplete. The TY 2018 debt of $14 (SOR 1.f) is immaterial.
Applicant also provided with her Answer evidence that she had completed paying
a settlement of her credit-card debt with Bank A (SOR ¶ 1.g). The bank sent her a letter
dated March 22, 2020, reflecting a settlement and a payment of $3,328. With respect to
her credit-card delinquency on an account with Bank B (SOR ¶ 1.h), Applicant wrote in
her Answer that she had paid the account balance of $3,487 in full on March 18, 2020.
She commented that she had requested that the bank provide her with a letter confirming
the payment, but she had not received the letter at the time she submitted her Answer.
Instead, she provided a copy of a page from her bank statement showing a payment to a
collection agency in the amount of $3,487, which is the amount of the balance due on the
account according to the SOR allegation.
Lastly, with respect to SOR allegation 1.i of a medical debt in the amount of $59,
Applicant wrote in her Answer that “all medical payments were paid in full.” She provided
no documentation with respect to the particular medical bill alleged in the SOR. The most
recent credit report in the record, dated November, 2, 2020, does not reflect that this 2017
debt has been paid. Aside from a relatively small auto loan balance, Applicant has minimal
balances  on  a  few  active  accounts.  She  and  her  husband  have  lived  in  rental  homes
throughout their marriage. (Answer at 1; GE 8 at 1-6.)
Since neither  party  asked for  a hearing in this  case,  the  record  contains limited
information as to why Applicant incurred large tax liabilities during the period 2012 to 2014
and  again  in  2016  and  2017.  The  record  does  reflect  that  Applicant  had  a  state  tax
liabilities of about $8,000 in TY 2004 and federal and state tax liabilities of over $40,000
in TY 2005. Also, Applicant had significant tax liabilities to her state tax authority for tax
years prior to 2016. The state issued a wage garnishment against Applicant in 2016. None
of those debts are alleged in the SOR. (GE 2 at 33-35; GE 3 at 30, 33; GE 9.)
The record is silent of the status of Applicant’s tax status in 2019 and 2020, though
her behavior in 2015, 2016, and 2018 shows that she acted much more responsibly in
recent years than she had in the prior years when the couple’s joint AGI was higher. The
record is also limited as to the source of the substantial funds Applicant required to pay
her tax and credit-card debts. In her Answer, Applicant merely commented that,  “I was
able to gather enough funds to take care of all of our taxes and credit cards.” There is no
information as to whether she withdrew funds from a tax-deferred savings account and
will have future tax liabilities or whether she had other liquid assets that were available to
pay  these  debts.  I  note  that  the  tax  transcripts  for  TYs  2016  through  2018  list  that
Applicant had a significant amount of dividend income, which reflects that she and her
husband had substantial stock investments. (Answer at 1.)
