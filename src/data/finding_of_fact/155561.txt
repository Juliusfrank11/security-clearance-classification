Applicant  admitted  the  2014  foreclosure  on  his  home,  and  accumulating  over
$10,000  delinquent  debt  (SOR  1.a-1.i).  He  disclosed  the  foreclosure  and  his  state  tax
debt  (SOR  debt  1.c  and  1.a)  on  his  October  2017  clearance  application  (Item  2).  He
discussed the SOR debtsCalbeit some under a prior creditor or collection agentCduring
his  November  2018  interview  with  a  Government  investigator  (Item  3),  based  on  his
December 2017 credit report (Item 4). He claimed at the time to have no knowledge of
SOR debts 1.d and 1.h, and incorrectly claimed to have made a repayment plan for SOR
debts 1.f-1.g and 1.i in January 2018, and to have paid them in full. In his Answer, he
stated  that  he  still  owed  about  $300  of  the  alleged  $737.  Department  Counsel  did  not
provide a copy of the receipt Applicant claimed to have submitted with his Answer, and
diligent search of DOHA records did not produce any such receipt. However, the amount
at issue in the three debts is incidental to the overall decision in this case.
Applicant is a 46-year-old principal systems  engineer employed by a U.S.  defense
contractor since October 2014. He documents continuous employment in  similar positions
since at least November 2009, but reports  small  breaks in  employment when contracts
ended, and he had  to find employment with a new  contractor. He  served honorably in  the
U.S. military from  September 1994 to April 1999. He  has twice married, and  has two sons
with his first wife, and  a step-child with his second wife.  He  held a clearance when he was
in the military, but has never held an industrial clearance (Item 2).
Applicant  describes  a  lengthy  history  of  financial  pressures,  beginning  with  his
2009  divorce  from  his  first  wife.  He  experienced  job  loss  due  to  reductions  in  force  or
furloughs in 2012, 2013, and 2014, resulting in the foreclosure on his house (Item 2, 3;
Response). In addition to his divorce expenses, Applicant and his wife had child custody
issues with her child between 2015 and 2017 (Response). His wife had medical issues in
2018. Moreover, she has been unable to work in 2020 because of pandemic restrictions.
Applicant=s Answer (Item 1) admitted the SOR allegations, but, except for the SOR
1.f-1.g  and  1.i  medical  debts,  did  not  otherwise  illuminate  his  financial  situation.  He
documented no efforts to contact any of his creditors or to provide a current status of his
debts. He documented no credit or financial counseling, and did not submit a budget. He
provided no work or character references, or evidence of community involvement.
