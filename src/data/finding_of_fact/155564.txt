Applicant  is  a  40-year-old  wireless  network  engineer  for  a  defense  contractor
who  seeks  a  security  clearance.  (GE  1;  Tr.  18)  Applicant  denied  all  but  two  of  the
allegations in the SOR with explanations. Findings of fact follow.
Background
Applicant married in July 2006 and has three children (ages 5, 7, and nine) from
this  marriage.  (GE  1;  Tr.  20)  He  earned  a  high  school  degree  in  June  1997  and
attended  college  classes  between  August  2003  and  May  2004  without  earning  a
degree.  (GEs  1-2)  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  June  2008  in  management
information systems. (GE 1; Tr. 19)
Applicant  enlisted  in  the  U.S.  Army  in  July  1997,  and  he  served  10  months  of
active  duty  (July  2997  through  May  1998)  before  receiving  a  general  discharge  under
honorable conditions in May 1998. (GE 1)
Since August 2017, Applicant has been employed by his current employer. (GE 1
and  AE  E;  Tr.  19-22,  36-37)  He  reported  periods  of  unemployment  between  February
2017 and August 2017 and between May 2002 and August 2004. (GE 1) Previously, he
was  employed  by  other  contractors  and  making  $150,000  a  year.  (GE  1;  Tr.  21-22)
Applicant’s wife is employed by the DoD. (AE R; Tr. 21)
Applicant’s finances
Before  Applicant  lost  his  job  in  February  2017,  he  maintained  his  finances  in
good order. (AE R; Tr. 19-20) Prior to losing his job, he and his wife purchased a home
for  their  family and three  children.  (AE Q)  During his seven months  of  unemployment,
he could not afford to cover the student loans he co-signed with his brother.
Between  August  2003  and  February  2008,  Applicant  took  out  seven  different
student loans that were guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education (DoE). (GEs
2-4)  These  loans  exceeded  $80,000  and  were  used  to  finance  Applicant’s  college
education classes. Credit reports document that these loans became delinquent in 2017
and were charged off in 2019. (GE 3)
Besides  his  student  loans,  Applicant  accumulated  delinquent  debts  with  two
other creditors listed in the SOR. These debts are covered by SOR ¶ 1.f (a credit card
debt  for $4,192) and SOR debt ¶ 1.i (a medical debt for $26). (GEs 2-3)
Since  returning  to  full-time  employment,  Applicant  has  addressed  each  of  his
SOR  debts.  He  documented  payoffs  of  SOR  debts  ¶¶  1.g  ($623)  and  1.h  ($510)  with
two payments of $404.67 and $324.65, respectively, leaving current balances of roughly
$320 with SOR creditor 1.g and a virtually zero balance with SOR creditor 1.h (AEs O-P
and  S;  Tr.  21-22.  35-36,  63-65  Applicant  also  validated  his  2019  payoffs  of  his
remaining  student  loans  covered  by  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.e  with  loans  from  his  wife’s
Government-funded  TSP  retirement  accounts  and  help  from  his  brother  on  one  of  his
co-signed loans. (AE K; Tr. 63-67) On this latter loan, Applicant and his wife continue to
monitor  his  brother’s  payments.  (Tr.  63-65)  He  documented  his  compliance  with  the
payment agreement he has with SOR creditor 1.f  and the $26 medical account balance
with SOR creditor 1.i (AEs A and J-P; Tr. 23-31)
With  his  documented  evidence  of  payments  and  payment  agreement  with  SOR
creditors 1.f (with monthly payments of $320) and 1.i, Applicant successfully resolved all
of the listed delinquent debts covered by the SOR (Tr. 32). He is now current with all of
his  accounts  covered  in  his  credit  reports.  (GEs  2-3  and  AEs  A  and  S;  Tr.  22-23,  25,
and 32-33)
Applicant  and  his  wife  maintain  a  monthly  budget.  (AE  H;  Tr.  64-65)  Their
monthly  budget  allots  monthly  expenses  for  the  mortgage  and  other  household
expenditures, which total $9,710. (AE H) With reported annual income from his wife and
himself of over $284,000, Applicant would appear to have ample resources to maintain
his finances in good working order in the future. (AEs F-G)
Character references and awards
Applicant is held in high regard by his supervisors (past and present), coworkers,
and friends who are aware of the financial issues affecting his security clearance. (AE I;
Tr. 73-75, 83-87) All of them credit Applicant with honesty and integrity, good judgment,
reliability, and strong moral ethics. Each of his character references consider him to be
worthy  of  holding  a  security  clearance  or  position  of  trust.  Applicant  has  received
numerous  certificates  of  recognition  by  his  employer  that  credit  him  with  displaying
outstanding attributes in support of his employer’s organization. (AE D)
