Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $56,469 for 15
delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a – 1.o). In response, Applicant admitted SOR 1.a,
1.b, 1.g. 1.h, 1.j, and 1.m. She denied the remaining allegations, and all of her responses
were accompanied by explanatory remarks. (Answer) In addition to the facts established
by Applicant’s admissions, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 39 years old. She and her ex-husband were married from November
2005 until they separated in 2012. A divorce was finalized in June 2014. Applicant has
two children by her ex-husband, now ages 19 and 15. Applicant’s ex-husband served in
the  military  but  was  involuntarily  discharged  before  they  separated,  resulting  in  a
significant  loss  of  household  income.  Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the  military
between  June  1999  and  June  2014,  when  she  was  involuntarily  separated  from  the
service with an honorable discharge as part of a force manpower adjustment. (Answer;
GX 1; GX 6; Tr. 7 – 8, 38, 50 – 51)
Since June 2014, Applicant has served in a military reserve unit where she drills
once a month and performs two weeks on active duty annually. After she was involuntarily
separated in 2014, she could not find full-time civilian employment until August 2015. Her
only income consisted of her monthly reserve pay and whatever unemployment benefits
she  may  have  been  receiving.  Since  2015,  Applicant  has  worked  for  various  civilian
employers. She also was unemployed between May 2017 and February 2018 after being
fired;  however,  the  record  suggests  that  she  was  not  terminated  for  misconduct,  but
because she and her manager were incompatible. Since February 2018, Applicant has
been steadily employed by companies doing business with the federal government. She
has held a security clearance  first granted while she was on active duty  since at least
2009. (GX 1; GX 5; Tr. 40, 42, 52 – 56)
In Section 26 (Financial Record) of her most recent security clearance application,
Applicant disclosed several delinquent or past-due debts. On March 18, 2019, she was
interviewed as part of her background investigation by a government agent, who reviewed
with her the contents of a credit bureau report (CBR) that reflected the debts alleged in
the SOR. Applicant asserted that her financial problems stemmed from the co-occurrence
of the loss of income after her ex-husband’s unplanned discharge; from her divorce, which
resulted  in  a  significant  loss  of  income  and  additional  expenses;  and  from  her  own
unplanned separation from the active duty military. She reported during the interview that
she was working with a debt management company to consolidate and repay her past-
due debts. (GX 5; Tr. 86)
After initially having custody of both children after her divorce, Applicant sent the
older  child  to  live  with  her  ex-husband  because  she  could  not  afford  to  care  for  both
children. She also was homeless at times, relying on various friends and relatives to allow
her and her child to stay with them. The debts alleged at SOR 1.a and 1.d arose when
Applicant  became  unable  to  pay  her  rent.  Another  rent-related  debt  (SOR  1.m)  is  the
result of fees assessed against her when she moved out of a different rental property.
(Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 6; Tr. 38 – 39, 56)
As  she  stated  in  her  March  2019  subject  interview,  Applicant  initially  worked  to
resolve her financial problems through a debt management company. She paid as much
as $700 each month for credit report corrections, general financial counseling, and most
important, an organized repayment plan for her debts based on settlement negotiations
with her creditors. By the fall of 2019, she realized that no progress was being made in
paying  off  her  debts.  In  December  2019,  Applicant  started  working  with  her  current
financial counselor, who has helped Applicant establish a monthly budget on which was
based a debt repayment plan that first addressed small and modest-sized debts she was
able  to  repay  quickly.  In  addition,  Applicant  and  her  financial  counselor  negotiated
repayment  plans  for  several  of  her  larger  debts  starting  in  late  2019  and  early  2020.
However,  in  December  2019,  Applicant  had  a  car  accident  in  which  she  hit  a  deer,
rendering her car a total loss. She subsequently incurred a $6,000 debt for the balance
of  her  car  loan  that  was  not  covered  by  insurance,  and  she  had  not  purchased  gap
insurance from the dealer who sold her the car. Applicant also incurred a debt for unpaid
car insurance premiums around the time of the accident. Neither debt was alleged in the
SOR, but Department Counsel introduced information about the debts that is relevant to
an examination of  Applicant’s actions  in response to  financial  problems.  Applicant  has
resolved the insurance debt and she is making $160 monthly payments to resolve the car
loan balance due. (Answer; GX 2; GX 6; AX A; AX I; AX J; Tr. 72, 102 - 105)
In response to the Government’s information, Applicant  showed  she has paid or
otherwise  resolved  the debts at SOR 1.d –  1.f, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, and  1.o. She also  is making
monthly payments or has established a payment plan to resolve the debts alleged at SOR
1.i  and  1.n. As to SOR 1.h, available  information shows it is a duplicate of the debt alleged
at  SOR  1.i.  This  duplication  resulted   with  the  transfer   of  the  debt  from  one  collection
agency to another.  Applicant  first  incurred this debt when she took out a loan to pay for
the legal  fees from her divorce. (Answer;  GX  2; GX 4;   AX  B; AX  C; AX  D; AX F; AX  G;
AX H;  AX K; AX L;  Tr. 43 –  45, 73 –  80, 88 –  90)
The $12,904 debt at SOR 1.a arose when Applicant was evicted from an apartment
for  non-payment  of  rent  in  August  2015.  Applicant  disputes  the  alleged  amount  due,
claiming she only was obligated to pay about $2,400, with the remainder consisting of
fees and interest charged by collection agencies. Applicant testified that starting in 2019,
she paid about $100 each month but had to stop after her  car accident. In May 2020,
Applicant  resumed  monthly  payments  but  stopped  because  of  her  dispute  over  the
balance due. (Answer; Tr. 15, 42 – 43, 58 – 67, 111)
SOR  1.b  alleges  a  debt  that  remains  from  a  car  loan  obtained  in  2012,  when
Applicant was still married and both she and her ex-husband were still on active duty.
Applicant last made a payment on this account in March 2014. She has not taken further
action  to  resolve  this  obligation,  choosing  instead  to  prioritize  other,  more  recent  and
resolvable debts. (Answer; GX 2; Tr. 67 – 72)
Applicant  also  disputed  that  she  owes  the  debt  at  SOR  1.c,  which  arose  from
alleged failure to return cable television equipment in 2015. Applicant testified that she
returned the equipment in 2015 to resolve this debt, but she has no receipt or other way
to corroborate her claim. Instead, she relies on the fact that the debt has not appeared on
any credit reports after September 2019. (Answer; GX 2 – 4; GX 6; Tr. 72 – 73)
The  $16,595  debt  alleged  at  SOR  1.g  also  was  incurred  during  Applicant’s
marriage. After her ex-husband was discharged and the couple lost a significant part of
their income, Applicant obtained a credit union loan to consolidate their bills. However,
she was unable to stay current on the loan payments and it was charged off in February
2013. She has not yet taken any action to resolve this debt. (Answer; GX 2; GX 5; Tr. 85
– 87)
The $3,991 debt alleged at SOR 1.m represents charges for repairs and damage
from an apartment where Applicant lived in 2015. Applicant claims she only owes about
$800. A repayment plan in 2019 was unsuccessful because of the car accident discussed
earlier. Applicant intends to re-establish a payment plan after the debt at SOR 1.i and the
debt resulting from her car accident are paid off. (Answer; GX 1 – 3; AX I; Tr. 96 – 97,
111 – 112)
Applicant and  her financial counselor have  established an organized plan to pay
down Applicant’s debts.  The  plan is incorporated into a monthly budget that will  reallocate
money to SOR 1.a, 1.b, and  1.g that is currently assigned  to pay the debts at SOR 1.i,
1.j, and  1.n, as well  as the aforementioned $6,000 balance  due  after her  car accident.
Applicant’s   income  is  sufficient  to   pay  these  debts;   however,  she  has  less  than  $200
remaining  each   month.   Applicant’s  plan  also  considers,   but  does  not  rely  on,  a  future
income increase from a pending job offer that would result in  a net monthly cash flow of
about $1,500. (Answer; AX A; AX E; AX I; AX J; Tr. 36, 48, 71, 100 –  110, 112  –  114)
