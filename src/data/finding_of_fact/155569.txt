Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the  pleadings,  including  Applicant’s  admissions  in  his  Answer  to  all  11  of  the  SOR
allegations,  his  testimony,  and  the  documentary  evidence  in  the  record,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 37 years old, married,  and  has a young  child. He  graduated from high
school   in  2001   and   earned  an  associate’s  degree  in   science  in  October  2011  from  a
technical institute (the  Institute). He began working for  a  DoD subcontractor  in  April 2019
and   was  hired  in   August  2019  by  the   DoD  contractor  to   work  directly  for  it   as  a   Test
Technician.  Both of these positions required  that he have  a security clearance. In March
2019, he submitted his SCA. He  has not previously held a security clearance.  (Tr. at  20-
21.)
Applicant  incurred  14  student  loans  to  pay  for  his  education.  He  paid  the  loans
when they became due every month until 2016 or 2017. At that time, his wife was a full-
time  nursing  student,  and  they  were  living  solely  on  Applicant’s  income.  The  monthly
payments due on his loans were more than he could afford, and he defaulted. All but two
of his loans were owned by the U.S. Department of Education (DOE). Applicant also had
two private student loans. The total debt incurred on the private loans was about $17,500.
At the time of his background interview, Applicant estimated that the total amount of his
14 student loans was about $58,000. (Tr. at 23-25; GE 2 at 3; GE 3 at 2-4; GE 4 at 2-3;
GE 5 at 2-4.)
In January 2018, a DOE service provider obtained  a garnishment of  Applicant’s
income. The garnishment amount was 20% of each of his paychecks and varied between
$300  and  $400  per  pay  period.  Applicant  was  under  the  mistaken  impression  that  the
garnishment extended to all of his student loans, including his private loans. In fact, the
garnishment  only  covered  his  DOE  loans.  In  October  2019,  Applicant  entered  into  a
rehabilitation payment plan with a second DOE service provider, which required him to
make monthly payments of $722 for nine months beginning in October 2019. He made
all  nine  payments  and  successfully  rehabilitated  his  12  DOE  loans.  These  loans  are
currently in good standing. Under the federal CARES Act enacted in 2020, his interest
rate was temporarily reduced to 0%. He is currently paying $200 per paycheck on all of
his DOE student loans. His total DOE debt is about $33,000. (Tr. at 23, 25-30; GE 1 at
45; GE 2 at 3, Answer at 1; AE E.)
In  August  2020,  Applicant  began  to  take  college  courses  part  time  at  a  local
university. He hopes to continue his education at a major state university. He wants to
pursue a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering so that he can qualify for a higher-
level  job  and  earn  more  income  to  support  his  family.  He  and  his  wife,  who  is  now  a
practicing nurse at a cancer center, collectively earn a significant income, and he is paying
for his college courses out of their earnings without incurring any additional student-loan
debt.  As  a  result  of  Applicant’s  current  status  as  a  part-time  student,  his  obligation  to
repay his DOE student loans has been deferred to August 2024. Applicant is committed
to repaying the DOE loans so that he can maintain his much-improved credit score and
demonstrate his commitment to acting responsibly. He appreciates that any failure to do
so could negatively affect any security clearance eligibility he may have in the future. (Tr.
at 22, 27-28.)
SOR Allegations
Six of Applicant’s 12 DOE student loans are alleged in the SOR at ¶ 1.b ($9,266),
¶1.c  ($8,861),  ¶  1.d  ($6,620),  ¶  1.e  ($5,653),  ¶  1.f  ($4,397),  and  ¶  1.g  ($4,332).  The
remaining six loans were not included in the SOR because they did not appear on his
credit reports. The total amount of the six alleged loans is about $39,000. The most recent
credit report in evidence, dated November 6, 2020, also reflects a total student loan debt
of  about  $39,000.  With  Applicant’s  successful  rehabilitation  of  these  loans  and  their
present status as current and deferred, these debts are current.
Applicant’s two private delinquent student loan debts are alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a and
¶  1.h.  The  total  amount  of  these  debts  is  about  $17,000.  A  third  party  filed  a  lawsuit
against the private lender claiming that the debts were unenforceable due to violations of
the  law  by  the  lender.  As  a  result  of  a  successful  resolution  of  this  lawsuit,  Applicant
received a notice from the lender informing him that the debts were not enforceable and
any payments of the debts would be returned to Applicant. Applicant testified that when
he learned that these debts were separate from the DOE loans, he made some payments
before learning about the lawsuit. These debts have been resolved. (Tr. at 24-25; AE B
at 1-9.)
The SOR lists three additional allegations of delinquent debts. They are:
SOR 1.i – Collection Account Owed to a Lender in the Amount of $300. During a
period when Applicant and his wife were living solely on his income, he took out several
short-term “pay-day” loans. He repaid each of these loans, except he overlooked this one
loan. He was advised of this collection account during his background interview on July
10, 2019. He repaid this debt on June 8, 2020 and provided evidence of his payment at
the hearing. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 30, 32-33; GE 3 at 10; AE E at 8.)
SOR 1.j – Collection Account Owed to a Medical Provider in the Amount of $297.
This debt arose when Applicant had a tooth extracted. He thought he paid what he owed
in addition to his insurance coverage at the time of the dental surgery. He never heard
further  from  the  surgeon.  He  was  again  advised  of  this  collection  account  during  his
background interview. He called the holder of the debt and learned that he owed more
than the amount listed on his credit report. He paid the account in two amounts, one for
$125 and a second of $504. He provided evidence of the payments at the hearing. This
debt is resolved. (Tr. at 30-31; GE 3 at 10; GE 4 at 1; GE 5 at 1; AE E at 9-10.)
SOR 1.k – Collection Account Owed to a Medical Provider in the Amount of $61.
This debt was for a medical appointment. After the background investigator advised him
of this collection account, he paid it in May 2020 and provided evidence of his payment
at the hearing. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 31; GE 3 at 11; GE 4 at 1; AE E at 11.)
Overall, Applicant’s finances are sound. Together, he and his wife make about
$110,000 per year. Their rent is a modest $1,500 per month. He and his wife split the
family bills between the two of them. He pays their rent, internet charges and cellphone
account. His wife keeps a separate bank account and pays the utility bills certain other
monthly expenses. He maintains a minimum balance of about $1,000 in his bank
account at all times. They each own a car and pay about $400 per month on their
vehicle loans. The cars were purchased new in  2018. Applicant has one credit-card
account with a small credit limit. He uses the card to pay for gas, and he pays the card
in full every month. He recently opened a new credit-card account with a higher credit
limit. He did this to improve his credit score. He puts aside three percent of his income
in his employer’s savings plan. The company matches his contributions. (Tr. at 33, 38-
39; AE D at 4-9.)
Due to their significant combined earnings and lack of tax deductions, Applicant
and his wife ended 2019 with insufficient withholdings to pay all of their federal and
state income taxes that were due in 2020. They have entered into payment plans to pay
the balances due to the IRS and their state, which totals about $10,000, and Applicant’s
wife makes monthly payments on those tax debts. They have adjusted their withholding
amounts to avoid any underpayments in the future. These debts were not alleged in the
SOR. (Tr. at 34-37.)
