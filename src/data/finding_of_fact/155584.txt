Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant  owed $52,680 for nine
delinquent or past-due  debts (SOR 1.a –  1.i). Six  of those debts (SOR 1.a –  1.c,  and  1.g
–  1.i) are for delinquent student loans totaling $48,761, or about 92.5 percent of  the total
debt  at  issue.  (FORM,   Item   1)   In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant   denied,  with
explanations and  supporting documents, each of the allegations therein. After reviewing
the Government’s information and  Applicant’s submissions in  response to the  SOR and
the FORM, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  59-year-old  employee  of  a  company  contracted  with  the  federal
government to support management of the health care system used by military members
and  their  families.  Her  duties  include  safeguarding  members’  personally  identifiable
information (PII) in that system. She has worked in similar positions in both the public and
private sectors since May 2008. She served briefly in the United States Army in 1981,
and  she  was  married  between  1983  and  1984,  when  she  and  her  husband  divorced.
Applicant remarried in 1985 and had two children, now adults, before divorcing in 1993.
Applicant  was  unemployed   for   two  different  two-month  periods  in   2014  due  to
medical   problems.   In  February  2017,  she  left   a  job  by  mutual  agreement  with  her
healthcare employer because of a  combination of  medical  problems and  the need to care
for  her mother, who was  suffering  from  dementia  and  Alzheimer’s disease. Those  factors
caused   Applicant   to  miss  too  much  time  from   work.  Applicant   started  at   her  current
employer sometime in  2018 and is now  a program  manager for  that contract.  (FORM,
Items 2, 3 and 8)
Applicant attended a technical training school  for  information technology (IT) skills
between October 2006 and  December 2010. The  student loans addressed in  the SOR
were obtained to pay her tuition. Applicant obtained  nine student loans  subsidized by the
U.S. Department  of  Education  between April 2008 and  December 2010 totaling $47,000.
The  loans addressed in  SOR 1.a –  1.c  and  1.g –  1.i became delinquent around the time
Applicant  left   her  job   in   2017.   In  June  2018,  Applicant  began   making  student  loan
rehabilitation  payments  through an  agreement  with  a creditor  who  took  over  the  loans
from the  Department of Education. Initially, she was advised that the rehabilitation plan
would resolve all of her past-due  loans through a single  consolidation loan at a monthly
payment rate of  $199, and  she established that those loans are now  in  good  standing.
However, the rehabilitation plan information she provided in  support  of her SOR response
reflected a consolidation loan for  about $16,439, far  less than the $48,761 documented
by  the  Government’s  information.  After   she  reviewed   the  Government’s  information,
Applicant made further inquiries and  learned that a  separate creditor owned  the remaining
student loan debt.  Applicant  has since entered into another rehabilitation program that
addresses   her  remaining  loans.  She  started  making  the  required  minimum  debit
payments in October 2020. (FORM, Items 2, 3, 4 and 8; FORM Response)
Applicant’s  Answer  established  that  she  repaid  the  debt  at  SOR  1.f  through
monthly  payments  of  $350,  between  January  and  May  2019,  to  satisfy  a  settlement
agreement she reached with that creditor. In the FORM, Department Counsel withdrew
SOR 1.f. (FORM, Item 2; FORM at page 2)
Available  information  also  shows  that  Applicant  started  working  with  a  financial
counselor in October 2018 to resolve discrepancies in her credit history, and to improve
her  personal  financial  management  while  repaying  her  past-due  debts.  As  a  result,  in
addition to the aforementioned student loan repayment plan in 2018 and the resolution of
the  collection  account  at  SOR  1.f,  Applicant  successfully  disputed  the  cable  television
debt  alleged  at  SOR  1.d.  Further,  in  March  2020  she  paid  the  delinquent  medical  bill
alleged  at  SOR  1.e,  albeit  after  receiving  the  February  2020  SOR.  That  medical  debt
arose from treatment Applicant  has received  for  what appears  to  be recurring  medical
problems  since  2014.  She  averred  that  this  debt  became  delinquent  when  she
inadvertently  failed  to  pay  a  bill  in  2019  while  on  short-term  disability.  Available
documentation supports this claim. (FORM, Items 2, 7 and 8; FORM Response)
