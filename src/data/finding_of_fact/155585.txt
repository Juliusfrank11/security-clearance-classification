Applicant is a 60-year-old executive level, executive assistant. He has served in
that  capacity  since  April  2019.  He  currently  maintains  a  security  clearance.  Applicant
graduated high school and attended some college. He was honorably discharged from
the United State military in 2004 at the rank of E-6 after 21 years of service.
Twice  divorced,  Applicant  has  one  adult  child.  He  married  his  second  wife,  a
medical therapist, in 2004. During their marriage, they bought a duplex in a distant state
as  an  investment  and  rental  property.  (Tr.  32)  During  their  marriage,  Applicant’s  wife
managed the bills, including matters related to real estate. (Tr. 50) Applicant divorced this
wife  in  mid-2015  after  a  15-month  separation.  Applicant  was  locked  out  of  the  marital
home in September 2015 by an unknown individual or entity. (Tr. 19) He quickly moved
into an apartment within the regionally high-priced rental market, then to a less expensive
unit to save money. (Tr. 19)
In mid-2016, Applicant started a two-year period of unemployment after losing a
job. (Tr. 26-30) Initially released from his job for cause, Applicant disputed the reasons
cited. The matter was appealed, favorably reviewed, and some back pay was restored.
In the interim, he sent applications to “quite a few” potential employers without success.
(Tr. 31)  Meanwhile, his ex-wife declared Chapter 13 bankruptcy. It appears at least two
accounts noted in the SOR were referenced in her bankruptcy or their divorce paperwork.
Applicant has acquired several delinquent debts. Reference was made during the
hearing  to  several  credit  reports.  It  was  noted  that  some  of  the  reports  contained
erroneous information, such as incorrect home addresses, or accounts balances that are
slightly off. Applicant believes these errors could be more numerous than he has cited.
(see Tr. 65-72) At issue in the SOR are the following debts:
1.a - $64,119 charged-off account –  This is  related to a  second  mortgage account.
(Tr.  60)   Applicant   is  not  familiar  with  either  entity   referenced  in  this  allegation.  Such
matters  were exclusively handled  by his now  ex-wife.  He is unaware of any relevant facts
regarding  this debt for  the same reasons noted, below, at 1.g. He has searched, but has
found no documentation regarding the account  among his scant records.
1.b  -  $14,255  charged-off   account  –   Applicant   admits  responsibility  for   this
delinquent debt,  which is related to  a 60-month duration personal  loan he got in  November
2014.  (Tr.  66)  He   took  the  loan  in   order  to  pay  his  divorce  attorney  while  he  was
unemployed. (Tr. 66) The matter has since been referred for collection and the legal firm
continues to refuse to work with him on a repayment plan. (Tr. 67)  Some of the materials
show  a sum slightly different than the one  at issue, the result of harmless error in  terms
of whether the debt remains owed; Applicant disputes these inaccuracies. (Tr. 65-75)
1.c - $13,227 charged-off  account –  The  account is related to a car  loan  on which
Applicant cosigned in  2013 for  his now  ex-wife.  Unbeknownst to Applicant, the car was
ultimately repossessed as the couple’s divorce was pending, which  explains why the auto
was  not  noted  in   the  final   divorce  decree.  (Tr.  77,   79)  After   being  interviewed  by
investigators, Applicant tried to contact the lender, but nobody would speak with him.  (Tr.
84)  However,  the  account  is  referenced  in   his  ex-wife’s  bankruptcy  petition   for   this
amount. (GEx. 6; AEx. 2)
1.d  -  $16,237  charged-off   account  –   Applicant  states  that   he   discussed  this
account with the lender, who offered to cancel  the obligation once  it verified Applicant had
no income at the time to make payments toward its  satisfaction. While there is no record
that this is what occurred, there is documentary evidence showing  the debt was cancelled
in  February 2018. (Tr. 85) The  related 1099-C tax  form was submitted with Applicant’s
excerpts of his tax  materials at the hearing. (Tr. 85-86; AEx. 1)
1.e  –   2017  foreclosure  –   Here,  the  underlying  mortgage  was   related  to   an
investment  rental  duplex   property  purchased  during  his  second   marriage   in   a  distant
state.  His ex-wife exclusively managed  this property and the handling of the mortgage.
The  last payment on  this property was made in  March  2014, around  the time Applicant
and his wife separated and while Applicant was still working. It went into foreclosure and
was auctioned in  November 2014. (Tr.  89) Applicant has no idea what his then-estranged
wife was doing with their bills after she moved out at the  beginning of their  separation. He
has no knowledge of what happened to the property or the underlying loan.  (Tr. 91)
1.f  -  $190  medical   collection  –   Because  Applicant   uses  TRICARE  medical
insurance, he does not know  how this  medical  collection account came into being  or was
not disposed  of by  his insurer. (Tr.  92)  He  spoke with TRCARE, which  had  no record of
a collection account. (Tr. 92-93) Any sums needed  to satisfy TRICARE come from  his
retirement  fund. (Tr. 94) Applicant assumes  this credit report entry  is an  error  as  he  is
sure he has no outstanding medical bills. (Tr. 94, 96) He  has not disputed the matter  with
the listed creditor or any of the credit reporting bureaus.
1.g - 2017 Mortgage Foreclosure –   This concerns the same property underlying
the debt noted above at 1.a. (Tr. 62) Applicant  knows little  about this property. His wife
managed all related payments and  bills. Applicant was unemployed at the time  when the
property  went  into  default  and  foreclosure.  Unbeknownst  to  Applicant,  it  went  into
foreclosure in  February 2017. (Tr. 52-53; GEx. 10 at 4) Matters related to this property
were not “within  [his] scope of monitoring.”  (Tr.  61) In addition, he was locked  out of the
property in  2015, as noted above, and  he does not know  what happened after he was
forced out of the home.  He  has  never  been  contacted about this property or  its  disposition.
He  has no paperwork regarding  the property.  (Tr. 51) His wife was  undergoing Chapter
13 bankruptcy proceedings  at the time. (Tr. 52, 60) Applicant’s only record  regarding the
properties  is  a  note   between   two  apparent  attorneys  discussing  their  accumulation   of
various records  regarding the  couple’s marital  properties and the car purchased in 2013.
(Ex. B)
At  present,  Applicant  earns  a  gross  salary  of  approximately  $79,000  a  year,  or
about $6,600 per month. He generates an additional monthly gross of $1,000 from his
military retirement and about $600 each month in disability payments. Sums owed to him
by his last wife under their divorce decree have  not been received because he “is still
chasing [her] down. . . .” (Tr. 36) He has under $1,000 in his checking account and an
amount  over  $8,000 in his  savings account.  (Tr.  38)  The sole credit  card  he  presently
maintains is in good standing. (Tr. 96) The present balance mainly represents additional
payments to his divorce attorney. (Tr. 97) He does not regularly check his credit report
because he prefers to pay cash and he is not anticipating needing credit at this time. (Tr.
95)
Applicant’s monthly rent is between $1,800 and $1,900. He owns a 2003 vehicle
with over 210,000 miles on the odometer and a 2017 automobile he purchased in 2020
with over 30,000 miles on the odometer. His monthly payment on the 2017 car is about
$425. After all expenses, Applicant has a net monthly remainder of $1,000. He pays his
regular and routine bills on time. Applicant is not a gambler and rarely plays the lottery.
He  seldom  eats  out  and  spends  little  on  meals.  (Tr.  46-47)  He  has  received  financial
counseling.  (Tr.  49)  He  maintains  a  relatively  Spartan  existence  consistent  with  his
lifestyle when single and in the military. (see, e.g., Tr. 107) Applicant noted, “I don’t spend
a lot of money. I don’t make a lot of money.” (Tr. 107)
Applicant stressed that he has never been “bad” with money, noting “my ex-wife
was  bad  with  money.”  (Tr.  87)  He  is  prepared  to  file  bankruptcy  regarding  the  main
accounts noted in the SOR if his ex-wife’s current Chapter 13 bankruptcy action does not
satisfy them. (Tr. 106) As he has no contact with his ex-wife and he is unable to find her,
he has no sense of whether she is still making timely payments on her bankruptcy plan.
(Tr. 106-107)
In closing, Applicant stated:
I worked for the government all my life.  . . . And I don’t know  what to tell you
guys. It’s just . . . it’s sad. . . . But if I say I eat to survive, I eat to survive. I
didn’t go on trips because I wanted to go on trips. . . . my  bills weren’t able
to  be  paid   because  I’ve  got  to  keep  a  roof  over  my  head,  one   of  the
questions  that  you   didn’t  ask   was,   during  that  time  that  you  were
unemployed,  how  much was your rent then? . . . . That will  take a chunk out
of every  penny that you have. [For  two  years while unemployed] I started
teaching kids, 12-year olds . . . every day. On the weekends. That’s how I
survived. Nothing else  got me through  it all. [In sum,] I didn’t spend a lot.
My ex-wife did. I’ve been trying to get her to court, but I can’t seem to locate
her. (Tr. 109-110)
