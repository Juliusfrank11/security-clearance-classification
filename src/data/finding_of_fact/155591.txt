Applicant  is  a  48-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  eligibility  for  access  to
classified  information  for  his  job  with  a  federal  contractor.  He  has  a  full-time  job  as  a
security assistant. He has been so employed since May 2018. Before that, he had a full-
time job as a security site manager for about five years during 2013-2018. He has not
held a security clearance in the past. (Exhibit 4 at Section 25) He is married, and he has
an  adult  child  and  an  adult  stepchild.  His  educational  history  includes  a  high  school
diploma  awarded  in  1991.  He  attended  two  different  technical  schools;  the  first  was
during  2000-2001,  and  he  earned  a  certificate  in  computer  hardware;  and  the  second
was during 2007-2012, but he did not earn a certificate or degree. (Exhibit 10 at 1-2)
In  his  security  clearance  application,  Applicant  reported
two  periods  of
unemployment in the last decade. (Exhibit 4 at Section 13A) He was unemployed from
September  2012  to  March  2013,  a  period  of  about  seven  months.  He  was  also
unemployed for about two months from January 2012 to February 2012.
The  SOR  alleges  a  history  of  financial  problems  consisting  of  four  delinquent
accounts  as  follows:  a  charged-off  private  student  loan  in  the  amount  of  $5,943;  a
$20,071 balance due after repossession of an automobile; and two collection accounts
for student loans with the U.S. Department of Education in the amounts of $12,224 and
$17,413. In total, the SOR alleges indebtedness of about $55,651.
In his answers, Applicant admitted the two federal student loans in collection. He
denied  (although  essentially  admitted)  the  charged-off  private  student  loan,  explaining
the account now had a balance of $0. And he denied (although essentially admitted) the
$20,071  delinquency,  explaining  it  was  paid  off  in  November  2020.  In  addition  to  his
admissions,  the four  delinquent  accounts  are  established  by  a July 2018  credit  report,
which was obtained during his background investigation. (Exhibit 5) He did not disclose
any delinquent accounts in his security clearance application, although he noted he had
filed tax returns late and paid all penalties. (Exhibit 4 at Section 26) The current status
of the four delinquent accounts is discussed below.
The  July  2018  credit  report  described  the  private  student  loan  as  a  charged-off
account  in  the  amount  of  $5,934,  and  the  account  information  was  disputed  by  the
consumer. (Exhibit 5 at 9) Applicant explained and provided reliable documentation that
the account now has a $0 balance because the debt was cancelled or forgiven as part
of  a  nation-wide  settlement  agreement  obtained  by  the  U.S.  Bureau  of  Consumer
Financial  Protection.  (January  2021  Answer,  Attachment  A)  The  October  2020  letter
from  the  creditor  specifically  states  that  Applicant  is  “no  longer  obligated  to  make  any
payment  on  your  [private  student]  loan.”  I  find  this  account  is  resolved  in  Applicant’s
favor.
The July 2018 credit report described the $20,071 delinquent debt as a charged-
off  account,  and  the  merchandise  was  taken  back  by  grantor  with  a  possible  balance
due.  (Exhibit  5  at  10)  The  debt  stems  from  a  $54,100  auto  loan  that  resulted  in
repossession  of  the  vehicle  in  May  2018.  Applicant  explained  and  provided  reliable
documentation that the account now has a $0 balance. (May 2020 Answer; March 2021
Supplement Answer, Attachments for SOR ¶ 1.b) His paperwork shows he paid a total
of  $1,400  over  several  months.  The  December  2020  letter  from  the  creditor  confirms
that there are no further payments due on the account. Although it is unclear if Applicant
paid off  the debt in  full  or settled it for a lesser amount, it’s clear that the account has
had  a  $0  balance  since  December  2020.  I  find  this  account  is  resolved  in  Applicant’s
favor.
The July 2018 credit report described the two federal student loans as collection
accounts  in  the  amounts  of  $12,224  and  $17,413.  (Exhibit  5  at  9)  In  an  attempt  to
resolve the accounts, Applicant applied to have the Department of Education discharge
the  debts  due  to  the  closing  of  the  educational  institution  he  attended.  (May  2020
Answer; January 2021 Answer; and March 2021 Supplement Answer, Attachments for
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d) He submitted the discharge application in November 2020. He has
yet to receive a reply to his discharge application.
In his April 2021 reply to the FORM, Applicant submitted reliable documentation
showing  that  in  March  2021  he  entered  into  a  rehabilitation  agreement  for  his  two
defaulted  federal  student  loans.  (Exhibit  A)  The  rehabilitation  agreement  calls  for
income-based  repayment  at  the  rate  of  $27  per  month  for  at  least  nine  monthly
payments  beginning  April  28,  2021,  at  which  point  his  defaulted  loans  would  be
considered  rehabilitated  and  eligible  for  a  repayment  plan.  The  paperwork  from  the
Department of Education shows a total balance due of about $32,243.
Applicant’s  history  of  financial  problems  or  difficulties  is  not  limited  to  the  four
accounts discussed above. Because these matters are not alleged in the SOR, I have
considered them for the limited purpose of evaluating Applicant’s evidence in mitigation.
His financial problems date back to at least 2003, and are discussed below.
By 2003, Applicant’s overall financial situation was such that he sought relief by
filing a voluntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. (Exhibit 6) The purpose of a Chapter 7
case  is  to  allow  a  debtor  to  obtain  a  fresh  start,  free  from  creditors  and  free  from  the
pressures of excessive indebtedness. In November 2003, the bankruptcy court granted
Applicant  a  discharge,  releasing  him  from  any  further  personal  liability  for  his  pre-
bankruptcy debts. (Exhibit 6)
In  addition  to  the  four  delinquent  debts  in  the  SOR,  the  July  2018  credit  report
reflects four  other collection accounts.  (Exhibit  5  at 8-10)  The first is a  $725  collection
account for a charged-off credit card account. The second is a collection account, with a
$0  balance,  that  was  settled  for  less  than  the  balance  in  full.  The  third  is  a  collection
account,  with  a  $0  balance,  that  was  settled  for  less  than  the  balance  in  full.  And  the
fourth  is  a  collection  account,  with  a  $0  balance,  described  as  a  paid  charged-off
account.
Applicant’s  financial  history  also includes  tax  problems,  as he  mentioned  briefly
in his 2018 security clearance application. (Exhibit 4 at Section 26) He provided a few
more details during his 2018 background investigation. (Exhibit 10 at 3) He stated that
he did not file income tax returns for 2004, 2007, 2008, and 2009. He further stated that
he sought out professional assistance in 2017, which resulted in a plan to resolve back
taxes.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3  The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4

‘right’ to a security  clearance”); Duane v.  Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th  Cir. 2002) (no
right to a security clearance).

There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.6
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability  to   live  within   one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,   and   meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,   lack  of   judgment,   or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and   regulations,  all  of  which   can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and   ability  to
protect classified or sensitive information. . .  .
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying
conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  or  difficulties  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.
The disqualifying conditions noted above apply here to the four delinquent accounts in
the SOR.
Applicant  has  not  sufficiently  explained,  extenuated,  or  mitigated  his  history  of
financial  problems.  I  have  reviewed  all  of  the  mitigating  conditions  under  Guideline  F
and  conclude  none  are  fully  applicable.  Applicant  has  resolved  two  of  the  four
delinquent accounts in the SOR. The two defaulted federal student loans were recently
5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).
6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶¶ E3.1.14 and E3.1.15
entered into a rehabilitation agreement,  with the first of nine  $27 monthly payments to
be made by April 28, 2021. The length of Applicant’s compliance with this agreement is
of  short  duration.  Accordingly,  it  is  simply  too  soon  to  tell  if  he  will  adhere  to  the
agreement.
Similarly, if Applicant satisfies the rehabilitation agreement, the loan servicer will
calculate  a  new  monthly  payment  based  on  the  balance  owed  at  the  time  of
rehabilitation,  and  the  monthly  payment  may  substantially  increase.  (Exhibit  A)  The
outstanding  balance  on  the  loans  was  more  than  $30,000  as  of  March  2021.  Given
these circumstances, coupled with Applicant’s history of financial problems or difficulties
dating  back  to  2003,  I  have  doubts  about  Applicant’s  ability  or  willingness  or  both  to
adhere to his plan to repay the defaulted student loans.
Following Egan  and  the clearly consistent standard, I have  doubts and  concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,   and   ability  to  protect
classified  or  sensitive  information.  In   reaching  this  conclusion,   I  weighed   the  evidence
as  a  whole  and   considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept.  I conclude  that he
has not met his  ultimate burden of  persuasion to show that it  is clearly consistent with
the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:
Against  Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a -- b:
Subparagraphs 1.c -- d:
For Applicant
Against Applicant
Conclusion
It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for
access to classified information. Eligibility denied.
