Applicant admitted both SOR allegations. After a thorough and  careful review of
the pleadings, exhibits, and  testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  Applicant is
a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 15  lines 12~14.)  He  has
been  employed  with   defense  contractors  for  “about  three  years,”   but   with  his  current
employer “since August 31st  of  this year,” 2020. (TR at page 17 line 14 to  page 18 line
1.)   He   currently  holds  no  security  clearance.  Applicant  is  unmarried,  and  has  no
children.  (TR  at  page  18  lines  10~15.)  He   is  a   “Structural   Mechanic.”  (TR  at   page  16
lines 17~20.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a. and 1.b.  Applicant has filed his Federal and state income tax returns, albeit
after the issuance of the SOR, for tax years 2012, 2013 and 2014. (TR at page 21 line
15  to  page  27  line  11.)  This  is  evidenced  by  those  filings.  (AppXs  A~C.)  He  was  due
refunds  for  all  three  years.  (Id.)  Applicant  has  also  offered  documentation  showing  he
has  filed  his  Federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2015~2019.  (AppXs
D~H.) He blames his late filings on procrastination (TR at page 23 lines 1~17.) He has
been working with a “financial advisor . . . since 2017.” (AppX J.)
