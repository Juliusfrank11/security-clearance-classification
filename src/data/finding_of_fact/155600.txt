In response to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted allegations  with explanations.  (Item
3)   He  denied SOR 1.l  and  1.m because  he has not been able to contact the  collection
company.  He   is   30   years   old   and  divorced  in   2013.   He   has   one   son.  (Item  4)   He
graduated from high school  in  2008. Applicant  served in  the  U.S. Air Force  from August
2008  until   August  2012,  when  he  was  honorably  discharged.  He   completed  a  security
clearance  application   on   September  1,   2017.  He   has  worked  for  his  current  employer

Financial
The  SOR  alleges  13  delinquent  debts,  including  consumer,  automobile,  utility,
and  medical  debts  that  have  been  placed  for  collection  or  charged  off  for  a  total  of
$31,349. (Item 1) His admissions total $30,932. (Item 3). The delinquent accounts are
as follows: ¶1.a ($1,000); ¶1.b ($1,134); ¶ 1.c ($802); ¶1.d ($10,227); ¶1.e ($7,491);¶ 1.f

¶1.m ($191).
Applicant  attributes  the  delinquent  debts  to  accounts  that  he  incurred  when  he
was  in  the  military.  After  serving,  he  took  lower  paying  jobs  and  his  bills  could  not  be
paid.  He  also  acknowledged  that  his  youth  and  lack  of  credit  seriousness  played  a
significant  role  in  his  conduct.  His  plan  is  to  have  all  debts  paid  within  the  next  five
years. (Response to FORM) Applicant also stated that he moved around frequently and
was  not  aware  of  some  of  the  bills.  He  also  added  that  his  divorce  and  lowering  of
income contributed to the accumulation of debt. (Item 5) In his 2017 subject interview,
he stated that he did not know what he was doing with his money.
In  Applicant’s  Answer  to  the  SOR,  he  asserted  that  he  had  contacted  creditors
and  arranged  payment  plans  for  four  of  the  alleged  debts  –SOR  ¶1.a-d  and  1.e.  He
contends that he has an arranged payment plan of $10 a week for the medical debt at
¶1.a.  Applicant  further  asserted  that  he  is  working  on  his  options  or  establishing
payment  plans  with  respect  to  the  remaining  admitted  debts.  He  did  not  provide  any
agreement plans.
As to SOR 1.c, he submitted cancelled checks from March 13, 2020 to July 30,
2020 for a total of $160. (AX A) As to SOR 1.d and 1.e, Applicant submitted cancelled
checks in the amount of $40 in the amount of $340 from March 2020 to July 2020. (AX
A)
Applicant  provided  no  additional  documentation  that  he  has  contacted  the
remaining creditors. Although he has stated that he has and will pay off more debts and
continue  with  a  plan  until  all  incurred  debt  is  charged  off.  He  believes  this  action
demonstrates  positive  changes  in  behavior  and  his  willingness  to  resolve  the  security
concern.
Applicant has worked for the U.S. Government for eight years and takes his job
seriously.  He  also  stated  that  he  is  considering  bankruptcy  with  credit  counselors  or
lawyers. He reviewed he credit reports and notes that there are only three accounts left
on the reports that are delinquent. The others are charged-off.
Applicant  stated  he  has  learned  from  his  mistakes  and  is  working  on  his  credit
report  to  “clean  up  my  mess.”  He  has  had  no  issues  in  the  military.  He  stated  that  he
has  changed  his  lifestyle  by  no  longer  using  credit  cards  and  trying  to  save  more
money. He received some financial counseling and debt consolidation more than seven
years  ago.  (Item  4)  At  the  interview,  Applicant  was  given  an  opportunity  to  submit
documentation  regarding  the  financial  delinquencies.  He  failed  to  provide  any
documentation or dispute information. (Item 4)
Applicant is gainfully employed. There is no information in the record concerning
his salary, use of a financial counselor (except the reference to meeting with a lawyer),
or  budget.  There  is  no  little  evidence  in  the  record  that  his  payments  are  being  made
pursuant to an agreement.
