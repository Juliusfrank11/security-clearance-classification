Applicant admitted his delinquent taxes, SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.f, and he denied his
consumer debts, SOR ¶¶ 1.g. through 1.i. He included some documents with his answer.
His  admissions  and  explanations  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  64  years  old,  divorced  but  remarried  with  no  children.  He  has  a
bachelor’s degree. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor overseas since
March 2016. Items 2, 3, and 4.
Applicant’s admissions in his Answer and the Government’s exhibits establish that
he is delinquent on his federal income taxes in the amount of just over $300,000. This
covers the years 2005 through 2009 and 2014. Applicant is making $600 payments per
pay period to the IRS. Applicant did not disclose his tax delinquencies on his December
22, 2015, e-QIP. He disclosed them during his May 9, 2019, personal subject interview
(PSI). Items 2, and 4 through 10. The record shows that federal tax liens were filed against
Applicant in 2011 and 2017. Items 8 through 10.
Applicant’s three consumer debts totaling $1,041  are supported by the record.  Item
11.  Applicant claims that the cellphone debt was incurred by an ex-wife.  The two other
debts, medical accounts, should have been paid by his health insurer. Item 2.
Applicant was audited for 2001 through 2005 and was found to owe $15,000  in
income  taxes.  Applicant  claims  that  because  he  deployed  overseas  he  appointed  his
brother-in-law  to  handle  his  tax  matters  but  that  his  brother-in-law  failed  to  do  so.
Applicant  has since retained a  tax-relief  advocate and  a  tax lawyer  to  clear  up his  tax
problems. Applicant said that his tax issues should be resolved by March 27, 2020. He
did not, however, provide any new or additional information. Item 2.
