Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  August  2017.  He  submitted  documents  attesting  to  his
superior job performance during that period. He is applying for a security clearance for
the first time. He has about three and a half years of college in  pursuit of a  bachelor’s
degree. He has never married, but he has lived with his girlfriend since about 2008. He
does not have any children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 17, 29-30, 43; GE 1; AE A-C)
Applicant has a history of alcohol-related criminal offenses. He was detained for
being drunk in public in 2005. The police held him in jail overnight and released him the
next day without charges. He was arrested in June 2005 and charged with driving under
the influence (DUI). He pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of wet reckless. He attended
several alcohol courses. (Tr. at 23-24; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 6)
Applicant was arrested in October 2009 and charged with DUI; DUI with a blood
alcohol  concentration  (BAC)  of  .08  or  more;  and  DUI  with  a  BAC  of  .15  to  .20.  He
pleaded  guilty  to  a  reduced  charge  of  reckless  driving,  and  the  other  charges  were
dismissed. He was sentenced to jail for one day (presumably with credit for time served
for the  day he was arrested), a fine,  and alcohol counseling.  (Tr. at 24-27; Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 6)
Applicant  was  gambling  and  drinking  at  a  casino  in  about  June  2017.  He  lost
about  $500.  He  saw  a  slot  machine  with  about  $100  credit  on  it.  He  waited  about  15
minutes, but there was no indication that anyone was playing the machine. He cashed
out the $100. When he visited the casino about two weeks later, he was confronted by
the casino’s security personnel. He was eventually charged with theft. He paid the $100
back, hired a lawyer, pleaded not guilty, and was prepared to fight the charge with the
defense  that  the  property  had  been  abandoned,  but  the  judge  dismissed  the  charge
without a trial. (Tr. at 18-22; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 7)
Applicant admitted that he drank and gambled too much for a period. He stated
that  he  significantly  cut  back  on  his  drinking  after  he  quit  the  moving  industry  and
started  working more stable jobs  in about 2015,  with  his current job  starting in August
2017.  His  coworkers  are  more  professional  than  his  previous  associates.  He  has  not
been  arrested  or  charged  with  anything  since  the  2017  theft  charge.  (Tr.  at  13-14-17,
27-28, 41, 44-45; GE 2)
Applicant’s  gambling  adversely  affected  his  finances.  He  used  his  credit  and
attempted to win enough to help him with his finances, but the exact opposite occurred
as  his  losses  exacerbated  the  problem.  He  estimated  that  he  lost  $2,500  from  about
March 2017 to June 2017. (Tr. at 30-31; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant  reported  his  criminal  issues  on  his  August  2017  Questionnaire  for
National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to financial questions, he wrote: “I am
trying to pay off my credit card and personal loan. Just have been a little pushed back
with  attorney  fees  and  rent.”  A  September  2017  credit  report  listed  that  he  had  a
defaulted  student  loan  in  collection,  with  a  balance  of  $20,473.  It  also  reported  two
accounts  with  a  credit  union:  a  credit  card  account  that  was  current  with  a  $16,425
balance;  and  a  loan  that  was  opened  in  April  2017,  was  $107  past  due,  and  had  a
$7,349 balance. (GE 1, 3)
A credit report from January 2019 listed that the balance of Applicant’s defaulted
student loan had been reduced to $14,139. Both credit union accounts were reported as
past due: the credit card account was $1,499 past due with a $15,275 balance; and the
loan was $923 past due with a $6,916 balance. (GE 4)
The SOR alleges the two delinquent credit union accounts. A credit report from
October 2020 listed both accounts as charged off, with balances of $15,270 and $7,004.
That  credit  report  listed  Applicant’s  student  loan  as  current  with  a  balance  of  $9,900.
(GE 5)
Applicant  stated  that  he  concentrated  on  paying  his  student  loans,  and  that  he
paid  more  than  $10,000  towards  them  since  2017.  The  credit  reports  corroborate  that
assertion. He has not made any recent payments toward the credit union accounts. He
stated  that  he  planned  to  contact  the  credit  union  in  an  attempt  to  resolve  the  debts,
either through settlement or a payment plan. He has not received financial counseling.
He rarely goes to the casino, and if he does, he does not take more money than he can
afford to lose. (Tr. at 14, 30-43; GE 3-5)
