Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR and amended SOR. After a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 44 years old. He has earned some college credits, but not a degree.
He was married from 1997 to 2004 and has two grown children from the marriage. He
remarried in 2014 and has three grown stepchildren. His wife is employed by the state.
Applicant was an independent contractor working for different federal agencies from 2012
to 2018. In 2018, he began working as a salaried employee for a federal contractor. (Tr.
24-31, 72)
Applicant  testified  that  in  2012  he  was  self-employed  as  an  independent
contractor. He was aware that he was responsible for having sufficient funds to pay his
tax obligations at the end of the year. He had become accustomed to having his taxes
withheld  from  his  pay  when  he  was  a  salaried  employee.  He  stated  he  repeatedly  fell
behind in addressing his tax issues because he prioritized paying other bills and then did
not have sufficient money to pay tax debts. In 2014, 2015, and 2016 he failed to timely
file his federal income tax returns. Applicant testified that he requested extensions to file
his federal tax returns for those years, but failed to timely file the federal tax returns after
the extensions expired. IRS documents reflect the returns for these tax years were filed
in December 2017. (Tr. 31-34, 38; 53-54, 73-76, 83-86; GE 5)
Applicant  failed  to  timely  pay  his  federal   income  taxes  in  2014  (SOR  ¶  1.a-
$37,469);  2015 (SOR ¶ 1.b - $37,260);  2016 (SOR ¶ 1.c - $38,626);  and  2017 (SOR ¶
1.d - $24,989).  He  also failed to pay his state income tax  in 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.e - $7,646);
2015 (SOR  ¶ 1.f  - $6,823);  2016 (SOR ¶ 1.g - $6,621);  and  2017 (SOR ¶ 1.h - $5,786).
In addition, a  tax lien was entered against him by his state in 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.i-$1,463).  A
federal tax lien was entered against him in 2018 in the  amount of $129,005.  (GE 5, 6, 7)
Applicant stated that he requested an installment agreement with the IRS around
2014 and was consistently paying $300 a month for a period of time. His IRS transcript
for tax year 2012 reflects he had an installment agreement with the IRS for unpaid 2012
income taxes. He made payments of $200 a month from August 2013 until July 2014 and
then stopped the payments. He stated in 2014 his grandmother became sick for about six
months  and  he  prioritized  other  bills.  The  transcript  also  reflects  payments  made  from
April 2020 through August 2020 that were collected through garnishment of his wages
and applied to the 2012 tax year debt. The transcript reflects that as of February 2021 he
has a balance owed of $3,306 for tax year 2012. (Tr. 39-47, 56-61, 90; GE 5; AE L)
The  IRS  transcript  for  tax  year  2013  reflects  he  had  an  installment  agreement,
which began in June 2014 and he made payments of $400 until March 2018. He missed
five  payments  during  this  time  period.  Applicant  provided  an  email  from  October  2019
indicating  he  was  being  assisted  by  a  professional  tax  service  to  make  an  Offer  in
Compromise (OIC) to the IRS. An OIC was made to the IRS in April 2018 and was denied
in September 2018. Applicant said he was offered an installment agreement, but the IRS
notice was sent to an address where he no longer lived, so he missed the deadline. By
the time he became aware of the installment agreement offer, it was no longer valid. A
federal lien was then filed. He withdrew from the tax service he was using. He said he
then worked on getting another installment agreement. The balance owed for tax year
2013 as of February 2021 is $4,960. (Tr. 39-47, 56-61, 88-98; GE 5; AE M)
A  September  2019  IRS  transcript  for  tax  year  2014  reflects  Applicant  made  a
payment of $400 in January 2015. A September 2019 IRS transcript for tax year 2017
reflects a payment of $2,000 in April 2019; $500 in May 2019; and $500 in June 2019. No
other payments are reflected in these documents. Applicant provided a pay history from
his  employment  from  March  2020  through  February  2021  which  shows  his  wages  are
being garnished because of the tax lien. (Tr. 39-47, 56-61, 90; GE 5; AE J, M, N)
Applicant provided IRS correspondence documents. A March 2020 letter from the
IRS notes an inquiry by Applicant about his 2012 income taxes. The IRS advised him that
it was still processing all of his information and a response was forthcoming in 90 days.
Another IRS letter to Applicant from October 2020 addresses his 2012 taxes with another
90-day response delay. A February 2021 IRS letter addresses tax years 2012 through
2018.  It  noted  it  had  received  Applicant’s  correspondence  from  January  2020  and  his
request for an installment agreement. The IRS established an installment agreement for
the tax years 2012 through 2018 that was scheduled to begin in March 2021 with monthly
payments  of  $2,100.  Post-hearing,  Applicant  provided  a  credit  card  receipt  with  a
payment  of  $2,201  on  his  installment  agreement.  (Tr.  39-47,  107-109;  AE  A,  B,  C,  P)
(Delinquent  taxes  for  tax  year  2012,  2013  and  2018  were  not  alleged  and  will  not  be
considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered when making a credibility
determination, in mitigation, and in a whole-person analysis.)
Applicant testified that he had an installment agreement to pay his state income
tax debt. He provided a copy of the payment agreement from April 2019, which required
him to pay $770 a month beginning in May 2019. His balance at the time was $24,513.
Prior to then he had made six payments in 2017 (five were for $298 and one was $595);
five payments in 2018 (four for $818 and one for $1,634). In May 2019, he began making
installment agreement payments of $770. He made consistent monthly payments from
May  2019  until  October  2019.  He  missed  the  November  2019  payment,  but  made
December  2019  to  February  2020,  when  he  stopped  the  payments.  Applicant  testified
that he stopped his monthly installment payments to the state because the IRS began
garnishing his wages in February 2020 due to the federal tax lien. (Tr. 39, 47-50, 98-101;
AE D, E, F)
Applicant sent a letter to his state tax authority in April 2020 advising it that because
his wages were garnished, he was unable to make his installment agreement payments.
The state advised him that it was able to cancel his current payment arrangement “and
place your case on hold through 6/20/2020 due to your financial hardship resulting from
the COVID-19 health crisis.” (AE D). He was advised the extension would expire in July
2020 and reset. In September 2020, he was advised that the hold on his payment plan
had been extended and would reset in October 2020 with resumption of payments due
sometime in November 2020. As of October 2019 Applicant’s balance owed for his state
tax liability was $20,766. No payments have been made on that balance since February
2020.  Applicant  stated  he  was  waiting  for  the  state  to  advise  him  about  the  payment
agreement restarting. Due to the pandemic it has been difficult to make contact with the
state tax authority. Post-hearing, Applicant advised that payments would be reinstated in
April 2021. He provided a copy of his tax balances owed for tax year 2015 ($2,489); 2016
($8498); 2017 ($7,764) and 2018 ($1,698). The cumulative balance owed to his state is
$20,450. (Tr. 101-107; GE 5; AE D, E, F, G, Q).
Applicant  has  no  savings  and   less  than  $100  in   his  bank  account.  He   has  no
investments. He  has  three credit cards on which  he makes minimum monthly payments.
He  keeps a  budget on a spreadsheet.  He  obtained  a $25,000 debt consolidation loan in
January 2021 that has  monthly payments of  $790; a credit union line  of  credit for  $15,000
with $295 monthly payments; a private lender loan for $5,600 with payments of  $564 a
month;  and  another private lender loan he obtained in October 2019 of $6,000 that he
used to pay taxes owed for  that year. The  monthly payments are  $200  and  the current
balance is about $4,000. He  testified that his annual salary is approximately  $109,000.
His wife earns about  $68,000. He  thought she may  have  a credit card that is delinquent.
In his February 2018 security clearance application, he noted that he took a vacation trip
to  the  Dominican  Republic  and  another  in   2017  to   Jamaica.  He   said   he  used  an
inheritance to pay for the 2017 trip. Applicant explained that he intends to meet the terms
of the  installment agreements by  getting a part-time  job in  the  future. (Tr. 53, 66-70, 77-
83, 113; AE O)
