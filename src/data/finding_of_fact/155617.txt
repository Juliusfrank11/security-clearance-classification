Applicant, age 30, is married with four minor children. He earned his high school
diploma  in  2008.  He  honorably  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Marine  Corps  from
2008  through  2018.  Following  his  discharge,  he  has  been  employed  by  two  defense
contractors:  as  an  electronic  maintenance  technician  from  July  2018  through  October
2018;  and  as  a  communications  radio  technician  since  October  2018.  He  has
maintained a DOD security clearance since 2008. (Items 2, 3, 7)
The SOR alleged twelve delinquent debts  totaling $41,546. In his SOR answer,
Applicant admitted the following four allegations: SOR ¶¶ 1.d ($2,592), 1.e ($1,447), 1.h
($643),  and  1.i  ($357).  He  denied  the  other  allegations.  Each  SOR  allegation  was
confirmed by one or more of his credit reports. (Items 1, 4-6)
Applicant  admitted  that  he  received  a  loan  in  2009  from  the  creditor  alleged  in
SOR ¶ 1.a. However, he denied the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a on the basis that the loan
account  was  repaid  in  full  via  monthly  allotments  from  his  military  pay  between  2009
and 2011. He filed a dispute to have the debt deleted from his credit reports. Although
the  debt  was  not  deleted,  the  dispute  was  noted  on  his  October  2020  credit  report.  A
reduced balance of $4,910 (which was not explained in the record) was also reported.
(Item 1 at 4; Item 6 at 3)
Applicant acknowledged that his wife received a loan in her sole name from the
creditor  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  at  some  point  not  specified  in  the  record.  He  did  not
indicate  whether  his  wife  satisfied  that  loan.  However,  he  denied  the  debt  alleged  in
SOR ¶ 1.b on the basis that he did not have an account with the creditor in his individual
name or jointly with his wife. The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b is reflected as an individual
account  on  Applicant’s  credit  reports  dated  September  2018  and  October  2019.  He
claimed  to  have  filed  a  dispute  to  have  the  debt  deleted  from  his  credit  reports.  The
dispute  was  not  documented  in  the  record.  The  debt  did  not  appear  on  his  October
2020 credit report. (Item 1 at 4; Item 4 at 6; Item 5 at 2; Item 6; Item 7 at 7)
Applicant denied the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c on the basis that the automobile
loan was settled in full by insurance proceeds paid to the creditor following a total-loss
accident  in  2015.  His  automobile  insurance  company  paid  the  creditor  approximately
$3,000  less  than  the  balance  remaining  on  the  loan.  He  was  assured  that  his  gap
insurance  would  resolve  the  deficiency.  Applicant  claimed  to  have  filed  a  dispute  to
have the  debt  deleted  from  his  credit  reports.  The dispute  was  not  documented  in the
record. The debt did not appear on his October 2020 credit report. (Item 1 at 4-5; Item
6)
Applicant  admitted  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.d,  which  relates  to  a  loan  he
received  in  approximately  2014  to  pay  for  expenses  associated  with  a  family  medical
emergency.  He  claimed  that  he  repaid  the  loan  in  full  via  monthly  allotments  from  his
military  pay  sometime  between  2014  and  2016.  However,  in  approximately  2017,  he
was notified by the creditor that it obtained a court judgment for a “minimal”  remaining
balance  due,  including  accrued  interest.  He  had  not  been  previously  aware  that  his
allotments  did  not  cover  the  entire  balance.  Since  then,  the  interest  has  continued  to
increase the balance due. He asserted that he has been in  “constant”  contact with the
creditor to try to negotiate a settlement. He filed a dispute to have the debt deleted from
his credit reports. The dispute was noted on his October 2020 credit report, but the debt
was not deleted. (Item 1 at 5; Item 2 at 38-39; Item 3 at 42-43 Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 5-6)
Applicant  admitted  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.e,  which  was  a  “credit  builder”
loan  account  he  opened  in  2018.  In  his  September  2020  SOR  answer,  Applicant
claimed to have initiated contact with the creditor to repay this debt. His October 2020
credit report revealed that the debt remained unresolved. (Item 1 at 5; Item 4 at 3; Item
5 at 2; Item 6 at 2-3)
Applicant acknowledged having a utility account with the creditor alleged in SOR
¶ 1.f. However, he denied the  debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f on the basis that he returned
the  equipment  for  which  he  was  being  charged.  He  asserted  that  he  completed  the
return  in approximately  November  2018 when he relocated to his  present  home state.
Applicant  claimed  to  have  filed  a  dispute  to  have  the  debt  deleted  from  his  credit
reports. The dispute was not documented in the record. The debt did not appear on his
October 2020 credit report. (Item 1 at 5; Item 5 at 2; Item 6)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  currently  maintains  an  active  account  with  the
creditor alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g. However, he denied the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g on the
basis  that  his  current  account  is  in  good  standing.  He  asserted  that  he  has  only  ever
had  one  account  with  this  creditor.  The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.g  is  reflected  as  an
individual  account  on  his  credit  report  dated  October  2019.  Applicant  claimed  to  have
filed  a  dispute  to  have  the  debt  deleted  from  his  credit  reports.  The  dispute  was  not
documented in the record.  The debt did not appear on his October 2020 credit report.
(Item 1 at 5; Item 3 at 43-44; Item 5 at 2)
Applicant  admitted  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.h,  which  is  a  charge  for  carpet
damage  that  was  discovered  in  his  military  housing  when  he  discharged  from  active
duty in 2018. He claimed that he was unaware of the charge until he was notified by the
creditor in June 2019. In his September 2020 SOR answer, he maintained that the debt
was “settled and paid.” The debt remained delinquent on his October 2020 credit report.
(Item 1 at 6; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 2)
Applicant  admitted  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.i,  which  is  a  charge  for  an
overpayment of his G.I. bill-related housing allowance. He claimed that he was unaware
of  the  overpayment  until  his  funds  were  garnished  in  January  2020.  He  then  learned
that the charge related to a one-month period when he was not enrolled in school. He
maintained that he was enrolled during that period but experienced connectivity issues
to  his  online  school  due  to  being  on  TDY  outside  of  the  United  States.  The  debt  was
reflected as paid on his October 2020 credit report. (Item 1 at 6; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 5)
Applicant admitted having a bank account with the creditor alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j,
which was in good standing when he closed it in 2012. He also acknowledged another
joint bank account with the same creditor (that he maintained with his wife), which was
in good standing when  they closed it in 2018.  However, he denied the debt alleged in
SOR  ¶  1.j  on  the  basis  that  it  is  unknown  to  him.  The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.j  is
reflected as an individual account  on Applicant’s credit report  dated October 2019. He
claimed  to  have  filed  a  dispute  to  have  the  debt  deleted  from  his  credit  reports.  The
dispute  was  not  documented  in  the  record.  The  debt  did  not  appear  on  his  October
2020 credit report. (Item 1 at 6; Item 4 at 6; Item 6; Item 7 at 7)
Applicant denied the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k on the basis that it is unknown to
him. He discovered that the debt is a women’s health clinic charge in the state where he
was  stationed  from  2012  through  2015.  During  those  years,  all  medical  expenses  for
him, his wife, and children were covered by his military insurance plan. He claimed that
he  was  unable  to  resolve  the  debt  with  the  clinic  directly.  The  clinic  referred  him  to  a
collection agency, the contact information for which he averred that he has been unable
to ascertain. He claimed to have filed a dispute to have the debt deleted from his credit
reports. The dispute was not documented in the record. The debt did not appear on his
October 2020 credit report. (Item 1 at 6; Item 4 at 6; Item 7 at 7)
Applicant  denied  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.l  on  the  basis  that  it  was  a
duplicate  of  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.  He  asserted  that  the  creditor  reported  the
same  account  twice.  The  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  and  1.l  are  reflected  as  two
different individual accounts with the same creditor on Applicant’s September 2018 and
October 2020 credit reports. Each account is reported with a different account number
and  balance.  There  is  no  indication  in  either  report  that  the  two  different  accounts
reference the same debt. Applicant filed a dispute to have the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.l
deleted from his credit reports. Although the debt had not been deleted, the dispute was
reflected on his October 2020 credit report. An increased balance of $14,756 was also
reported. (Item 1 at 4, 6; Item 4 at 7; Item 5; Item 6 at 3-4)
Applicant’s October 2020 credit report revealed two delinquent debts not alleged
in the SOR. First, an individual utility account placed for collection in October 2019 with
a  $2,406  balance.  Second,  a  joint  home  rental  account  placed  for  collection  in  June
2019  with  a  $9,069  balance.  The  report  noted  a  consumer  dispute  for  each  of  these
debts. The record did not reflect any other information about these new debts. Because
they  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  I  will  consider  them  solely  for  the  purpose  of
evaluating mitigation and the whole person concept. (Item 6 at 1-2)
investigation
During  his  January  2019  background
interview,  Applicant
characterized  his  financial  situation  as  “in  debt  recovery  mode.”  During  that  interview,
he  was  confronted  with  the  debts   that  appeared  on  his  September  2018  credit  report,
the  majority  of   which   he  claimed  no  prior   knowledge.   He   explained  that  he  had   not
brought any financial-related documents to his interview because he lost access to  them
when  his  military  email  was  deactivated.  He   affirmed  that   he   was   willing   and   able  to
repay his debts.  He  anticipated using the extra funds he had  then recently received  as
hazard  pay  to   help  him  resolve  his  delinquent  debts.   The   record  did   not  contain
information concerning the amount of  those extra funds or an  allocation as to how  they
were applied, if at  all, to his delinquent debts. He  also anticipated engaging  a company
to  help  him  “fix   his  credit.”  He   did  not   proffer   whether  he  engaged  those  services  or
otherwise received assistance with repaying his debts. (Item 7 at 9)
Applicant  did  not  provide  any  documents  to  corroborate  the  claims  he  made  in
his SOR answer. He also did not proffer any information concerning his relevant income
and  expenses.  He  has  not  received  any  financial  counseling.  However,  he  took  a
financial  class  about  smart  spending.  He  believes  that  his  maturity  and  other  lifestyle
changes  will  ensure  that  he  has  no  future  financial  difficulties.  Those  changes  include
making  more  informed  decisions,  maintaining  a  proper  debt-to-income  ratio,  and
modifying his spending habits. He stated that he is “past the age where he wants what
he sees on TV.” His is now motivated by his desire to build a better life for his wife and
children. (Item 7 at 9)
