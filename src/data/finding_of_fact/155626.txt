Applicant admitted all the allegations in SOR. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  59-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  page  7.)
He  has  been  employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  1997.  (TR  at  page  15  lines
14~16.) Applicant is married and has two adult children. (TR at page 15 line 17 to page
16 line 2.)
Guideline E, Personal Conduct & Guideline D, Sexual Behavior
1.a. and  2.a. From about 2003 until the summer of  2016, while holding a security
clearance  and   SCI  access  eligibility,  Applicant  patronized   massage  parlors,  where  he
engaged in  sexual  activity about “every two or three months”  with staff  members of  the
parlors whose citizenship  was unknown to Applicant. (TR at page  16 line 24 to page 18
line 19.) He has not told his spouse of this sexual conduct. (TR at page 21 lines 5~14.)
1.b. Despite agreeing to the Government’s request,  in writing in  or  about 2008, to
cease  the  abovementioned   sexual   conduct,   Applicant  continued  said   conduct   until   the
summer of 2016. (TR at page 19 line 16 to page 21 line 14, and at page 27 lines 9~23.)
