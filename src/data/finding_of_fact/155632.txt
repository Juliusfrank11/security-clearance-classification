Applicant  is  a  45-year-old  configuration  management  specialist  for  a  defense
contractor  who  seeks  a  security  clearance.  The  allegations  covered  in  the  SOR  and
admitted  by Applicant  are  incorporated  and adopted as  relevant and material findings.
Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant  married  in  December  1999  and  separated  in  2012.  (Items  2-3)  She
filed for divorce in January 2014 and is still trying to work out their spousal differences
amiably.  (Item  3)  She  has  one  child  from  their  marriage,  age  11.  (Item  2)  Applicant
earned a high school diploma in January 1993 and attended college classes at a local
community  college  between  January  1993  and  June  2000.  (Item  2)  She  earned  an
associate’s  degree  in  June  2000.  (Item  2). Applicant  reported  no  military  service.(Item
2)
Since  March  2010,  Applicant  has  been  employed  as  a  legal  secretary  for  a
county  district  attorney’s  office  in  her  state  of  residence.  Contemporaneously  with  this
employment, she has been hired as a configuration management specialist, contingent
upon  her  obtaining  a  security  clearance.  (Item  2)  She  worked  for  non-defense
contractors between April 2008 and March 2010 in various job capacities. Applicant has
never previously applied for or held a security clearance. (Item 2)
Applicant’s finances
Applicant  and  her  husband  accumulated  delinquent  federal  and  state  taxes  for
tax  years  2015  and  2017-2018.  (Item  3)  Records  document  that  she  owed  delinquent
federal  taxes  for  tax  years  2015,  2017,  and  2018  in  the  aggregate  amount  of  $2,000.
(Items  2-3)  She  accrued  comparable  delinquent  taxes  ($2,000)  owed  to  her  state  of
residence for the same tax years of 2015 and 2017-2018.
Applicant  attributed  her  federal  and  state  tax  delinquencies  to  confusion  and
uncertainty over how to file her joint federal and state tax returns for the years in issue
without  her  husband’s  cooperation.  (Items  2-3)  Evidently,  she  did  not  consult  a  tax
counselor until 2019. (Item 1, attachment to Applicant’s response)
In  2017,  Applicant  leased  a  vehicle  for  $31,000  that  carried  monthly  lease
payments of $480. (Items 3-5) After being denied her request to the leasing to return the
vehicle without charge due to mechanical issues, Applicant returned the vehicle anyway
to the dealership in February 2017. (Item 3) She reported that the dealership accepted
her  return  and  informed  her  that  she  still  owed  $9,939  on  the  sales  balance  on  the
vehicle. (Items 3-5)
In  February  2019,  Applicant  filed  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  protection.  (Item  1)
She  received  her  bankruptcy  discharge  in  September  2020.  (Item  1,  attachment  to
Applicant’s  response) She claimed without any schedule  documentation  that  her three
listed  delinquent  consumer  debts  listed  in  the  SOR  (¶¶  1.a  and  1.d-1.e)  were
discharged  in  her  2020  Chapter  7  bankruptcy.  (Item  1,  attachment  to  Applicant’s
response)  Without  the  included  creditor  schedules,  discharge  of  these  three  SOR
consumer debts cannot be verified and credited to Applicant.
Claiming  her  delinquent  federal  tax  debts  for  tax  years  2015,  2017,  and  2018
were  set  off by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2019 by applying an earmarked
refund for tax year 2015 to the owed taxes for tax year 2015, Applicant documented an
installment agreement she completed with the IRS that left a $2,000 balance owing to
the  service.  (Item  1,  attachments  to  Applicant’s  response).  With  the  applied  refund  to
the  balance  owing  for  the  2015  tax  year  credited,  Applicant  was  left  with  a  balance
owing  for  2015  in  the  amount  of  $551.  (Item  1,  attachment  to  Applicant’s  response)
Whether  any  remaining  federal  taxes  are  owed  for  tax  year  2015  is  not  clear  from
Applicant’s submissions.
Applicant also supplied a payment summary from the IRS documenting monthly
payments  of  $200  between  November  2019  and  May  2020  (totaling  $1,400)  that  the
IRS  applied  to  Applicant’s  carried  forward  balance  for  tax  year  2017.  (Item  1,
attachment  to  Applicant’s  response)  Whether  these  payments  were  covered  by  an
installment  agreement  with  the  IRS  is  unclear.  Questions  remain,  too,  over  whether
Applicant is still indebted to the IRS for back taxes owed for any or all of tax years 2015,
2017 and 2018.
Addressing  the  admitted  SOR  allegation  (SOR  ¶  1.g)  that  she  owes  $2,000  in
delinquent taxes to her state of residence, Applicant claimed she was making monthly
payments on the amount owed ($2,000) to her state of residence and has since paid all
past due taxes owed the state for tax years 2015, 2017, and 2018. (Item 1, attachments
to  Applicant’s  response)  Based  on  her  submissions,  Applicant  is  entitled  to  credit  for
resolving her state tax debt.
