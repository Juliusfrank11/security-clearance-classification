Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f and 1.h, which he
denied.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  31  years  old.  He  is  a  high  school  graduate  and  has  earned  some
college credits, but not a degree. He was married in 2009 and divorced in 2012. He has
a child from the marriage. He was in the Marine Corps Reserve from 2009 to 2014, when
he  was  discharged  due  to  unsatisfactory  performance  in  the  ready  reserves.  His
discharge was under other than honorable conditions. He has been employed by a federal
contractor since March 2019.
The SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts (¶¶ 1.a-1.m) totaling approximately $36,101.
These  debts  are  corroborated  by  Applicant’s  admissions  in  the  SOR;  disclosures  and
admissions in his security clearance application (SCA) from April 2019; his admissions
during  his  May  2019  background  interview;  and  credit  reports  dated  April  2019  and
November 2019. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5)
In  Applicant’s  SCA,  he  disclosed  the  delinquent  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a
through  1.e,  1.g,  1.i.  and  1.j.  The  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.d  is  for  delinquent  child  support.
Applicant stated in his background interview with a government investigator that the state
where he resides automatically withholds child support payments from his paycheck. This
is  how  the  state  processes  such  payments.  When  he  changed  jobs  his  child  support
payments  stopped  because  his  new  employer  did  not  take  action  to  withhold  the
payments. Applicant’s federal income tax refund was involuntary applied to the delinquent
child support balance. Applicant provided documentary proof dated February 2020 that
this debt is resolved. (Items 1, 2, 3)
Concerning the delinquent debts, Applicant disclosed in his SCA that he was either
making  monthly  payments  or  was  planning  to  make  monthly  payments  and  the  debts
would be resolved by the end of the year (2019). When he was interviewed in May 2019,
he said he was  either making small payments  towards  many of the alleged debts  and
they would be resolved by the end of the year; was working with the creditor to settle the
debt; would start making payments soon; or would pay the debt by the end of the year.
(Items 2, 3)
In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR  for  those  debts  he  admitted  he  owed,  he
indicated he had payments arrangements. He said he was to pay as follows: SOR ¶ 1.a-
$300 a month; ¶ 1.b-$67 a month; ¶ 1.c-$50 a month; ¶ 1.e-$40 a month; ¶ 1.g-$40 a
month; ¶ 1.i-$20 a month; ¶ 1.j-$75 a month; ¶1.k-$25 a month; and ¶1.l-$50 a month.
In Applicant’s FORM response, he said he had one more payment to resolve the
debt in SOR ¶ 1.j ($599) and a couple of payments to resolve ¶ 1.i ($718). He also stated
that the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.g were the only remaining debts to be
paid. He did not provide documentary proof to support his assertions. (Item 1; AE A)
The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  is  for  a  repossessed  vehicle  from  2015,  he
explained in his SOR answer that he returned the vehicle to the dealership when he could
no longer make the payments. He received a letter from the bank and a lawyer regarding
the debt, but he did not pay it. He has some questions about the balance owed. It is not
resolved. (Items 1, 2, and 3).
In his SOR answer, Applicant provided copies of receipts from January to March
2020  to  show  he  made  payments  towards  the  medical  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.f
($1,374) and 1.h ($921) His receipts reflect four payments totaling $1,147. In his response
to the FORM, he provided a receipt ($288) that he said was for the medical debt in ¶ 1.l
($338).  Applicant  claimed  that  these payments  resolved the  debts,  but did not  provide
corroborating documentation that his lesser payments had fully satisfied the debts or were
accepted as settlements for the debts. Insufficient evidence was provided to resolve these
debts. (Item 1; AE A, B)
In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he provided a receipt from September 2020
to show the debt in SOR ¶ 1.m was paid in full. It is resolved. (AE C).
Applicant  told  the  government  investigator  that  his  financial  problems  began  in
December 2012 when his mother was diagnosed with cancer, and he took out two loans
to help the family (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c). He made payments on the loans until sometime
in 2013 when he switched jobs and could no longer afford to pay them. He said he was
“young and  dumb” and  stopped the payments. Other accounts that became delinquent
were for credit cards used for his personal purchases, cell phone accounts, and medical
expenses. (Item 3)
