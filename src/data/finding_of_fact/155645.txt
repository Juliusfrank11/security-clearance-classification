Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  37  years  old.  He  is  a  high  school  graduate.  He  took  some  college
courses,  but  did  not  earn  a  degree.  He  served  in  the  Marine  Corps  from  July  2001  to
September 2005 and was honorably discharged. He is not married and has no children.
(Item 3)
On his January 2019 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed that
he was a student from September 2005 to January 2008 and again from March 2010 to
June  2010.  He  disclosed  that  he  was  employed  from  January  2008  to  March  2008;
unemployed  March  2008  to  June  2008;  employed  June  2008  to  September  2008;
unemployed September 2008 to March 2010; employed March 2010 to September 2016;
unemployed September 2016 to April 2017; and employed April 2017 to June 2017. He
began his current job working for a federal contractor in July 2017. (Items 3, 7)
The  SOR alleges six  delinquent student loans totaling approximately $26,099,  and
a  delinquent  medical  debt  in   the  approximate  amount  of  $1,001.  During  Applicant’s
February 2019 background interview with a government investigator, he explained  that
the student loans were for  a school  that  he attended that later  closed. According  to  his
credit reports,  he received the loans in  2006 through 2008. He  said  he did  not pay the
loans  because  he  was  not   earning  enough.   He   applied  for  a  student  loan  forgiveness
program. He  told the investigator  he had  not  received  any information on his application.
He  did not provide  evidence to show  what actions he may have  taken regarding the loans
while  he was working or if  he made any contact with the  creditor  to  request a  forbearance.
He  stated that in  January 2019, his wages were garnished to pay his student loan  debt.
In  his  submissions,  he  stated  that  he  was  advised  that  he  did  not  qualify  for  the   loan
forgiveness program. He  provided pay stubs to  show  in  January 2019  his wages were
garnished to repay the student loans. In 2020, the garnishment was paused due  to the
COVID-19 pandemic. The  garnishment resumed in  2021. (Items 2,  3, 4, 5,  6,  7: AE  1, 2,
3, 4)
During his background interview, Applicant denied the medical debt alleged in the
SOR,  believing  his  medical  expenses  were  covered  by  his  veteran’s  benefits.  In  his
answer to the SOR, he admitted the debt. He did not provide any information about the
status of this debt, nor did he mention its status in his submissions. All of the debts alleged
are corroborated by Applicant’s admissions and credit reports. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; AE
1)
Applicant told the investigator that he is capable of meeting his financial obligations
and  intends  to  resolve  his  debts  immediately.  He  attributed  his  financial  problems  to
unemployment and underemployment. (Item 7)
