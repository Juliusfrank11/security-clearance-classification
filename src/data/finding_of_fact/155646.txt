Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owes $35,707 for six delinquent
debts (SOR 1.a – 1.f). In response, Applicant admitted with explanations SOR 1.a – 1.c.
He  denied  with  explanations  SOR  1.d  –  1.f.  (FORM,  Items  1  and  2).  His  admissions
establish the SOR allegations as facts. As to his denials, Department Counsel noted that
Applicant provided explanations with his responses but no documentation. To be clear,
Applicant’s denials framed the allegations in SOR 1.d – 1.f as controverted issues of fact.
Accordingly, it became the Government’s responsibility to present sufficient information
to  prove  those  allegations.  (Directive,  E3.1.14)  In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by
Applicant’s admissions, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  44-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  for  whom  he  has
worked as an installer since February 2018. Between October 2004 and November 2016,
he worked in similar positions for other defense contractors. He was unemployed for nine
months  in  2016  and  2017  after  a  previous  employer  lost  its  federal  contract.  All  of
Applicant’s work since 2004 has been performed overseas in the same country. Applicant
served on active duty in the U.S. Navy between June 1995 and August 2004. He has held
a security clearance since at least December 2006. (FORM, Items 3 and 7)
Applicant disclosed in  his e-QIP that he had  incurred a delinquent credit card debt
that he  had  paid off that debt in  January 2014. He  also disclosed that he
for  $8,000, and
had  missed one  mortgage  payment in  January 2015, and  that had  also resolved  that past-
due   debt.   During  the  ensuing   background  investigation,  government  investigators
obtained  a credit report  in  August 2017 that documented  the debts listed at SOR 1.a  and
1.f. As to  the latter, the report  showed Applicant was past-due  for $4,227 on an account
balance in  July 2017 of $11,679. On July 5, 2019, Applicant completed a subject interview
(SI)   with  a   government  investigator  during  which   he  discussed  those  debts.   Applicant
denied  the  SOR  1.a   debt  was  his,  suggesting  that  it  actually  was  his  father’s  debt.
Applicant acknowledged the SOR 1.f  account was his,  but he could not provide  details
about  the  origin  or  history  of   the  debt.   He   acknowledged  during  the  interview  that  his
spending habits likely contributed  to this delinquency. He also stated that he planned to
have   all  of  his  debt  resolved  by   the  end   of  2019.  A   credit  report  obtained  by  DOD
adjudicators in  November 2019 reflects the  debts addressed at SOR 1.b –  1.e, but makes
no  mention  of  the  debts  at  SOR  1.a  or   1.f.  All  of  the  delinquent  or  past-due   debts
documented  by  the  Government’s  information  were  accrued  between  2015   and   2017.
(FORM, Items 3, 6, and 7)
In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  now  acknowledges  that  SOR  1.a  is  his
responsibility, claiming it is a debt he incurred because he lost track of it as he moved “to
different locations.” He further asserted that he and the creditor agreed to settle the debt
for half of the total owed, which was to be paid by “May 2021.” In response to the FORM,
Applicant claimed this debt is being paid down; however, he did not support this claim
with  any  payment  receipts  or  other  documentation.  (FORM,  Items  2,  5,  and  6;  FORM
Response)
As to SOR 1.b, in response to the SOR, Applicant claimed that this credit card debt
was incurred with a joint user, and that Applicant has contacted the creditor to verify the
charges on the card and to arrange for repayment. In response to the FORM, Applicant
claimed that the original $5,371 delinquency has been reduced to $2,417 and that, as of
October  13,  2020,  “[p]ayment  was  being sent  via  regular  mail and  (sic) should have  a
zero balance in the  next two weeks.” None of this has been documented. (FORM, Items
2, 5, and 6; FORM Response)
When Applicant responded to the SOR, he averred the SOR 1.c debt had been
paid off and that he was waiting for confirmation from the collection agency in possession
of the account. In response to the FORM, Applicant stated claimed the account had a
zero  balance  and  that  he  anticipated  having  it  removed  from  his  credit  history.  The
account  still  showed  as  delinquent  in  credit  reports  obtained  in  November  2019  and
August 2020. Applicant did not submit any documentation to support his claims that the
debt has been resolved. (FORM, Items 2, 5, and 6; FORM Response)
Applicant  denied  owing  $1,360  for  the  delinquent  cell  phone  account  alleged  at
SOR 1.d. The account still showed as delinquent in credit reports obtained in November
2019 and August 2020. Although he disputes this debt as “in error”  in  response  to the
FORM, he indicated that he settled the matter and now has a zero balance due with that
service provider. Again, there is nothing in the record that supports this claim. (FORM,
Items 2, 5, and 6; FORM Response)
Applicant  denied the  alleged debt  for  an unpaid utility  bill  in SOR 1.e.  He owns
multiple  rental  properties,  and  claims  that  one  of  his  tenants  was  responsible  for  this
account. Applicant provided documentation showing that he paid this debt in September
2020,  and  stated  he  planned  to  seek  reimbursement  from  his  tenant.  (FORM,  Item  2;
FORM Response)
Applicant  describes  his  current  finances  as  sound  and  claims  that  he  is  able  to
meet all of his regular financial obligations without difficulty. He has worked overseas for
most of the past 15 years and ascribes his financial problems to a combination of poor
spending habits and his failure to keep track of his accounts caused, in part, by multiple
relocations. As of September 11, 2020, Applicant earned a net bi-weekly income of about
$4,000,  which  equates  to  about  $8,600  in  monthly  take-home  pay.  His  paystub  also
shows  he  receives  a  bi-weekly  housing  allowance  of  $1,503,  which  equates  to  about
$3,250  monthly.  In  the  FORM,  Department  Counsel  repeatedly  highlighted  the
importance of documentary support for Applicant’s claims. Additionally, the deadline for
Applicant’s response to the FORM was extended for 30 days, yet he did not provide any
other  information  about  his  monthly  expenses  or  about  any  professional  financial
counseling he has received. (FORM at page 3; FORM, Items 2 and 7; FORM Response)
