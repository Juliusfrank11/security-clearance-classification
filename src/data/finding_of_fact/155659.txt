In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) He
also  provided  extenuating  and  mitigating  information.  (Id.)  Applicant’s  admissions  are
accepted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the  evidence  of
record, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  39-year-old   health  service   information  technology  specialist
employed  by  the  same   defense  contractor   since  December  2018.  (Tr.  5,  22)  He   was
employed from April 2018  to December 2018 at  another company. He  was employed  in
a food store from 2010 to October 2017. (Tr. 22) He  has never served in  the military. (Tr.
7)   In  2000,  Applicant   graduated  from  high  school.  (Tr.   6)   In   2013,  he  received  an
associate’s  degree in  business administration. (Tr. 6, 25) In  2006, he married,  and  in  April
2019, he was divorced. (Tr. 23) Custody of his six-year-old son  is shared  with his former
spouse. (Tr. 7, 23)  He  does not pay or receive any child  support or pay or  receive any
alimony. (Tr. 24)
Financial Considerations
Applicant had financial problems because of his son’s medical problems. (Tr. 26)
His son was born in 2014 and had a stroke. (Tr. 26) He was unemployed from October
2017 to April 2018. (Tr. 22, 26)
Applicant’s SOR alleges nine Department of Education (DOE) student loan debts
totaling $59,802 that were placed for collection in the following amounts: ¶ 1.a ($10,588);
¶  1.b  ($10,289);  ¶  1.c  ($9,906);  ¶  1.d  ($5,990);  ¶  1.e  ($5,739);  ¶  1.f  ($5,060);  ¶  1.g
($4,842); ¶ 1.h ($3,109); and ¶ 1.i ($4,279). The SOR also alleges his $115,334 mortgage
was at least 120 days delinquent in the amount of $2,299.
Applicant provided  three screen shots  from his TransUnion Credit  Report showing
16   DOE/Nelnet  student  loans  with  status  “on  time”   and   totaling   $83,673  as  follows:
$10,674;  $10,372;  $9,986;  $6,038;  $5,785;  $5,274;  $5,101;  $4,881;  $4,506;  $4,311;
$3,336; $3,296; $3,187; $3,187;  $3,132; and  $607. (Tr. 34;  AE F) In  March  2019, his $676
federal income tax  refund and  his $321 state income tax  refund were diverted to address
his student loan debt.  (AE G)  He provided  eight monthly checking account  statements
from  May  2019  to  December  2019  showing  $5  payments  to  address  his  DOE  student
loan debts. (AE H) The payments were automatically deducted from his bank account.
(Tr. 28; AE  H) In December 2019, a new  company purchased  his student loans, and  his
automatic payments from his bank stopped. (Tr. 27-29) In  2020, he learned Nelnet  had
his student loan account,  and  in  February or March 2020, he contacted Nelnet. (Tr.  29)
Nelnet  wanted $400 monthly, and  Applicant  said  he is paying $20 to $25  a month.  (Tr.
30)  He   made  some  payments  to   show   his  good  faith.  (Tr.  34-35)   He   tried  to   maintain
contact with his student loan creditors.  (Tr. 26)  The  creditor informed Applicant  that they
are  not  collecting  mandatory  payments   until   August  2021   because  of  the  CARES  act;
however, he has arranged for  $50  payments to begin  on  April 16, 2021. (AE I)  He  made
his first $50 payment on April 7, 2021. (Id.)
In 2018,  Applicant’s mortgage became delinquent. (Tr. 31) His December 30,  2019
credit report  shows his last activity on his mortgage account was in  October 2018. (Tr.
31) He  said  it  became delinquent because of his separation from  his spouse. (Tr. 31)  His
May 2020 mortgage statement shows his mortgage was current, and he had  paid $7,303
in  2020 to the mortgage company. (Tr. 30;  AE B) His December 2020 mortgage  statement
shows  he  made  payments  totaling  $15,691  to  address  the  mortgage,  and   escrow
payments  totaling  $7,356   for   taxes  and   insurance   in   2020.  (Id.) His  monthly  mortgage
and   escrow  payment  is  $1,071.   (Id.)  His  March  2021  mortgage  statement  shows  a
balance owed on his mortgage of $110,095. (Id.) His mortgage is current.  (Id.)
Applicant’s   net  monthly  income  after  deductions  is  $1,750.  (Tr.  31)  His  monthly
mortgage payment is $1,071. (AE B) He  does not have a car payment as he purchases
used vehicles. (Tr. 37-38) He  has about $300 available  after  paying his expenses. (Tr.
32) His  son is remote learning. Applicant is high risk because of  the Corona Virus and
works  at   home.  (Tr.  32)  Applicant   would  like  to  obtain  part-time   employment  after  the
economy  returns  to  normal   to  increase  his  income.  (Tr.  32)  He   has  about  $2,000  in   a
savings account and $50,000 in a retirement account. (Tr. 32-33)
Applicant  was  unemployed  for  a  time  while  he  cared  for  his  son.  He  may  have
been able to obtain a deferment for up to three years in his student loan payments due to
unemployment.  See  Ryan  Lane,  Student  Loans,  How  to  Get  an  Unemployment
Deferment  for  Your  Student  Loans,  Nerd  Wallet,  https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/
loans/student-loans/unemployment-deferment-student-loans. (HE 4) However, in order to
obtain an unemployment deferment, a debtor must be receiving unemployment benefits
or seeking a full-time job to get this deferment. (Id.) Applicant did not present evidence
that he sought an unemployment deferment in student loan payments.
Under the Federal Government’s COVID-19 relief rules, Applicant’s student loan
payments have been deferred since March 13, 2020:
To provide relief during the COVID-19 emergency, the U.S. Department of
Education (ED) has stopped collection activity on defaulted federally owned
student loans and/or grant overpayments. In addition, interest is temporarily
set at 0% on defaulted federally owned student aid debt. This 0% interest
and  stopped  collections  period  will  last  from  March  13,  2020,  through  at
least Sept. 30, 2021. You can still make payments if you choose. (U.S. Dept.
of  Education  website,  Don’t  get  discouraged  if  you're  in  default  on  your
federal  student  loan,  https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/default/get-out.
(HE 5)
The DOE has provisions for a loan rehabilitation agreement with nominal monthly
payments:
Under  a  loan  rehabilitation  agreement,  your  loan  holder  will  determine  a
reasonable  monthly  payment  amount  that  is  equal  to  15  percent  of  your
annual  discretionary  income,  divided  by  12.  Discretionary  income  is  the
amount  of  your  adjusted  gross  income  (from  your  most  recent  federal
income  tax  return)  that  exceeds  150  percent  of  the  poverty  guideline
amount for your state and family size. You must provide documentation of
your  income  to  your  loan  holder.  (Id.)  See  also  U.S.  Dept.  of  Education
website,  Coronavirus  and Forbearance Info for  Students,  Borrowers,  and
Parents, https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/coronavirus. (HE 6)
The  annual  poverty  guideline  in  Applicant’s  state  for  a  two-person  family  is
$17,420. Wisconsin Dept. of Health Services website, Federal Poverty Level Guidelines,
https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/medicaid/fpl.htm. (HE 6) Applicant’s income is below 150
percent of the poverty guideline of $26,130.
After  completion  of  the  loan  rehabilitation  agreement,  a  debtor  can  enroll  in  an
“income-driven  repayment  plan.”  U.S.  Dept.  of  Education,  If  your  federal  student  loan
payments are high compared to your income, you may want to repay your loans under
an  income-driven  repayment  plan,  https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/
plans/income-driven. (HE 7) Under the “income-driven  repayment plan” a debtor  starts
with  payments  of  15  percent  of  their  discretionary  income,  which  is  calculated  by
subtracting  the  state  poverty  guideline  amount  from  income.  As  income  increases,
payments increase until the debt is either paid or 20 years of payments elapse. (Id.) Any
debt left after 20 years of payments is forgiven. If his income is below the 150 percent
threshold, he would not need to make any payments to address his student loan debt.
Applicant paid several non-SOR debts, and he showed he had a zero balance on
a credit card. He made sporadic minimal payments over the last several years to address
his student loan debts; however, he did not make sufficient payments to keep the student
loan debts current. The magnitude of his student loan debts are expected to continue to
increase as he currently lacks the income to pay down his student loan debts.
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 2.a alleged that Section 26, “Financial Record – Delinquency Involving
Routine  Accounts,”  of  Applicant’s  November  19,  2018  SCA  asked  whether  in  the
previous seven years Applicant had any bills or debts turned over to a collection agency,
or whether he had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for
failing to pay as agreed. Applicant answered “yes” and disclosed a medical collection debt
he  subsequently  paid.  In  his  SCA,  he  did  not  disclose  his  student  loans  that  were  in
collections status. SOR ¶ 2.a did not allege that he failed to answer truthfully whether he
had any debts that were more than 120 days past due.
Applicant’s  November  27,  2018  credit  report  indicates  he  has  16  DOE  student
loans with balances ranging from $10,057 to $586; the last activity on all 16 accounts is
April 2018; and date of report to the credit reporting company is November 2018. (GE 3
at  3-7)  The  status  is  “student  loan  permanently  assigned  to  government;  collection,
educational.”  (Id.) The November  27,  2018 credit  report  does  not indicate  whether  the
DOE is a “collection agency.” (GE 3) DOE contracts with multiple companies for collection
services. See U.S. Dept. of Education website, If you default on your federal student loan,
the loan may be placed with a collection agency, which will then contact you to obtain
payment, available at https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/default/collections.
Applicant’s  November 27, 2018 credit report  also shows 16 DOE accounts, 120
days or greater past due, the last activity on accounts in January 2018, with zero balances
and accounts transferred and closed. (GE 3 at 7-11) This credit report shows two Navient
student loans with statuses of “pays as agreed,” and  accounts transferred and  closed.
(Id. at 15) It shows six DOE accounts with the balance dates of May 2012, zero balances,
and statuses of transferred, and pays as agreed. (Id. at 16-17) The only account in the
collection section is a medical debt that is a “paid collection” with a zero balance. (Id. at
18)
Applicant said he was unaware that his student loans were delinquent more than
120 days at the time he completed his SCA. (Tr. 35) He checked a Credit Karma credit
report before completing his SCA, and it did not list his delinquent mortgage or student
loans as having gone to collections. (Tr. 35, 41) He did not retain a copy of the Credit
Karma credit report that he used to prepare his SCA. (Tr. 40) His creditors wrote and said
they were going to send the student loans to collections or charge them off; however, they
did not actually take those actions. (Tr. 36) He regretted his reliance on the Credit Karma
report and his decision not to list his student loans on his SCA. (Tr. 42-43)
As to his mortgage, Applicant said he stopped making his payment in December
2018, and it was not delinquent when he filled out his SCA. (Tr. 36) Applicant said he
answered truthfully on his SCA based on his Credit Karma credit report. He believed his
debts changed to collection or delinquent status after he completed his SCA. (Tr. 18-19,
35-36) He did not intend to conceal the fact that his student loans had gone to collections.
He admitted his delinquent debts during his OPM interview. (Tr. 18)
Character Evidence
Applicant’s supervisor described him as a “very kind, friendly, hard-working, and
personable individual.” (AE A) “His work ethic is professional and appropriate, and he is
eager to be a contributing member . . . and looks forward to taking on new challenges, as
well  as  getting  involved  wherever  he  can.”  (Id.)  She  indicated  he  is  calm,  courteous,
efficient,  dedicated,  and  helpful.  (Id.)  He  makes  important  contributions  to  mission
accomplishment.  (Id.)  His  2020  performance  evaluation  describes  his  exceptional
productivity and contributions to his employer. (AE C)
