In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted two of the SOR allegations pertaining
to financial considerations (SOR ¶¶ 1.b. and 1.d.). His comments with respect to both his
admissions and his denials are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review
of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following
findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense  contractor. He has been serving
as site lead  with his  current employer overseas since  February 2006. In addition, he had
been serving in  various positions with the U.S. Army on active duty or  the inactive  reserve,
or the Army National Guard in  the inactive reserve, from January 1991 until May 2016.
Upon  completion  of  his  active  duty,  he  was  honorably  discharged.  He   received   a
bachelor’s  degree  in   2002.  He   was  granted  a  secret   clearance   in   1991,  and   it  was
renewed  in  2001.   In   2007,  he   was  also   granted  access  to  Secret   Compartmented
Information   (SCI).   He   was   married   in   1991  and   divorced in   2017.  He   married again in
2018. He  has four children, born in  1995,  1998, 2002,  and  2004,  as well as  one  step-
child, born in 2009.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can  be  found  in  the  following  exhibits:  Item  4  (Combined  Experian,  TransUnion,  and
Equifax Credit Report, dated February 16, 2018); Item 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated
March  25,  2019);  Item  6  (Equifax  Credit  Report,  dated  December  30,  2020);  Item  7
(Enhanced  Subject Interview,  dated  October  5, 2018); and Item 1  ((TransUnion Credit
Report, dated June 8, 2020), attached to Applicant’s Answer to the SOR).
In October 2018, during an interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of
Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant described his overall financial situation as “ok.”
He contended that, with the exception of his student loans, all of his bills were current.
(Item 7, at 6). He attributed his financial problems to a variety of factors: his separation
and divorce from his former wife, her use of a joint account, and the fact that his wages
were garnished for child support. (Item 7, at 5-6)
The SOR alleged six delinquent accounts that were placed for collection, totaling
approximately $76,080, as set forth as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a. refers to a student loan with an unpaid balance of $61,735 that was
past due in January 2018. (Item 4, at 6) During his OPM interview, he acknowledged that
he had stopped making payments on the loan when his funds were garnished for child
support. It was his intention to resume making his payments on the student loan when his
divorce lawyer’s fees were paid off in February 2019. (Item 7, at 5) However, in his Answer
to the SOR, Applicant noted that the account was no longer on his credit report. (Item 2)
His future intentions are now unclear. The account has not been resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.b. through 1.d. refer to unpaid medical bills for $564, $264, and $217
that were incurred while using military hospitals overseas, and they were past due in June
2015. (Item 4, at 6) During his OPM interview, he contended that all of the bills had been
paid in full when he received them, and that it was unclear why they still appeared on his
credit report. (Item 7, at 5-6) However, in his Answer to the SOR, he admitted that two of
the bills remained unpaid, and that the one for $264 was no longer on his credit report.
(Item 2) His future intentions are now unclear. The accounts have not been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.e. refers to a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $9,189 that
was charged off in January 2012. (Item 4, at 7)  During his OPM interview, he contended
that it was a joint account that was used by his ex-wife, and that he had requested that
the creditor remove his name from the account. (Item 7, at 5) In fact, the account is an
individual one in his name only. (Item 4, at 7) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant noted
that the account was no longer on his credit report. (Item 2) His future intentions are now
unclear. The account has not been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.f. refers to a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $4,111 that
was charged off. (Item 7, at 5)  During his OPM interview, he contended that it was an
account that he shared with his ex-wife, but he was unable to continue making payments
because of his child-support obligations. (Item 7, at 5) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant
noted that the account was no longer on his credit report. (Item 2) His future intentions
are now unclear. The account has not been resolved.
Other  than  Applicant’s  unverified  contentions  regarding  his  efforts  to  resolve
certain delinquent accounts, there is no documentary evidence, such as repayment plans,
cancelled checks, bank account registers, receipts from creditors, or garnishment orders
to support that he has made any efforts to address any of his delinquent accounts.
During  his  OPM  interview,  Applicant  reported  an  annual  salary  of  $72,000,  in
addition to an annual $24,100 housing allowance. Also, he received $19,236 for annual
vehicle  and  gasoline,  for  a  total  of  $115,336.  He  did  not  report  his  current  monthly
expenses or any monthly remainder that might be available for discretionary spending or
savings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of financial counseling.
In  the  absence  of  additional  financial  information,  it  remains  difficult  to  determine  if
Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had been.
