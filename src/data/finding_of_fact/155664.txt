In her  answer  to the SOR, Applicant admitted  9  of the 25 financial allegations  (¶¶
1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h,  1.p, 1.q, 1.t, 1.v, and  1.x).  She denied 16 SOR financial allegations (¶¶
1.a through 1.c, 1.e, 1.i through 1.o, 1.r,  1.s, 1.u, 1.w,  and  1.y).  Notwithstanding, all of
the  SOR  allegations   are  established   by  the  record  evidence.   Her   admissions   are
incorporated herein as  findings  of fact. After a thorough  review  of the record evidence,  I
make  the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  56-year-old  consultant/program  manager  working  for  a  Federal
contractor. She has been married and divorced three times. She last divorced back in
June  2000.  She  has  one  adult  child,  age  32.  Applicant  attended  college  between
January 2008 and May 2013, and earned an associate’s degree.
Applicant started working for her current employer, a Federal contractor and her
clearance sponsor, in December 2015. According to her 2019 SCA, she has been fully
employed,  and  without  periods  of  unemployment,  since  2015.  However,  Applicant
disclosed in her 2019 SCA a work history marred by periods of unemployment. She was
unemployed  between  July  2015  and  December  2015;  between  November  2013  and
April 2014; between November 2011 and August 2012; and between August 2009 and
October 2009.
Applicant  has  four  prior  periods  of  employment  with  Federal   contractors   -
between  April   2014  and   July  2015  (laid  off);  between  December  2010  and   November
2011;  between  October  2009   and  May  2010;   and   between  August  2006  and   August
2009. She was granted eligibility for a secret clearance in August 2008.
In  response  to  Section  26  (Financial  Record)  of  her  2019  SCA,  Applicant
disclosed she had financial problems that included a delinquent car loan, a repossessed
car, and cancelled credit cards. She attributed her financial problems to her periods of
unemployment  caused  by  corporate  downsizing  and  her  suffering  from  chronic
migraines, which caused excessive absenteeism. Applicant noted that she currently (as
of  February  2021)  was  seeing a  new neurologist  and  had her  migraines  under  control
and has not had to miss work.
The  subsequent  background  investigation  addressed  her  financial  situation  and
revealed  the  delinquent  accounts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  During  her  August  and  October
2019  interviews  with  a  government  investigator,  Applicant  discussed  her  delinquent
accounts,  and  that  she  filed  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  February  2,  2012,  and  was
discharged of her dischargeable debts in May 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.x).
Applicant’s   explanations  for   the  SOR  accounts  and   the  status  of  the  accounts
follow:
SOR ¶¶  1.a  ($12,719) and  1.w  ($16,591)  –   These alleged the same account, a
charged-off car loan. I find SOR ¶ 1.w for Applicant. Applicant stated that in December
2016, she took a loan of more than $16,000 to purchase a car. She claimed the creditor
told  her  that  the first payment  of  $450  was  due  three  months  later.  (Item  6)  The  loan;
however,  required  her  to  start  making  the  first  payment  within  30  days  and  monthly
thereafter.  She  failed  to  make  the  first  three  payments  and  the  car  was  repossessed.
She claimed she never received notice of her default or the repossession. I note that in
her SOR answer (Item 2), Applicant stated she was granted 60 days to make the first
monthly  payment.  Applicant  claimed  this  charged-off  account  was  supposed  to  be
removed  from  her  credit  report,  but  provided  no  reason  for  that.  She  presented  no
documentary evidence to corroborate any of her claims. This debt is unresolved.
SOR ¶  1.b –   This is an $8,226 charged-off car loan. Applicant claimed that this
account  was  discharged  through  the  bankruptcy  in  May  2012,  and  that  it  is  no  longer
reflected in her credit reports. On the contrary, the record credit reports show that this
account  was  opened  in  November  2012,  five  months  after  the  May  2012  bankruptcy
discharge.  (Items  5,  7)  She  presented  no  documentary  evidence  to  corroborate  her
claim  that  the  account  was  included  in  her  bankruptcy  discharge.  This  debt  is
unresolved.
SOR  ¶¶  1.c  ($6,098)  and  1.y  ($6,098)  alleged  the  same  charged-off  account.  I
consolidated the allegations under SOR ¶ 1.c. I find SOR ¶ 1.y for Applicant. Applicant
claimed having no knowledge of this account and denied it. The account is reflected in
Applicant’s February 2020 credit report. (Item 7)
SOR  ¶   1.d   –   This  is  a  $4,209  medical  debt  in  collection.  In  her  SOR  answer,
Applicant  admitted  the  debt  and  claimed  her  insurance  company  should  have  paid  it.
She stated she was demanding payment from her insurance company.  She presented
no documentary evidence to corroborate her claims. This debt is unresolved.
SOR  ¶   1.e   –  This  is  a  $1,853  collection.  During  the  August  2019  interview,
Applicant  discussed  this  account  with  the  interviewer.  She  denied  having  any
knowledge  of  it.  In  her  SOR  answer,  she  claimed  she  “disputed  the  account  with  no
results.” The account is shown as outstanding in Applicant’s 2020 credit report. (Item 7)
Applicant presented no documentary evidence to corroborate she disputed the debt  or
to establish the legal basis for the dispute. This debt is unresolved.
SOR  ¶¶   1.f   ($733   charged-off   account);   1.g   ($648  charged-off   credit  card);   1.h
($456  charged-off   credit  card)   -  Applicant  admitted  responsibility  for  these  accounts
during  her  2019  interview.  Apparently,  she  contacted  the  creditors  and  established
payment plans back in 2017. She then hired a debt-recovery company in 2017 to help
her  resolve  her  delinquent  accounts  and  assigned  the  accounts  to  it.  The  2020  credit
report  notes  that  she  disputed  the  debts  after  resolution  and  they  were  charged  off.
These debts are unresolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.i ($430), 1.j ($335), 1.k ($299), 1.n ($78), 1.o ($65), 1.r ($209), and 1.s
($64), alleged medical debts placed for collection. During her 2019 interview, Applicant
claimed she was not aware of these delinquent accounts until she reviewed her credit
report  in  August  2019.  In  her  Answer  to  the  FORM,  Applicant  claimed  she  was  not
notified  of  these  debts,  but  was  in  the  process  of  obtaining  information  to  ensure  she
can pay them in full.
Applicant  claimed  she  attempted  to  pay  these  medical  debts  with  no  results,
because  she  did  not  have  the  account  numbers  and  the  creditors  were  not  able  to
provide her with the account numbers. She promised not to stop attempting to clear up
these  debts.  She  presented  no  documentary  evidence  of  efforts  to  settle,  pay,  or
otherwise resolve these debts. These debts are unresolved.
SOR  ¶   1.l   –   This  is  a  $271  delinquent  account  placed  for  collection.  Applicant
disputed  the  account,  as  reflected  in  her  2020  credit  report.  (Item  7)  She  provided  no
evidence about the legal basis for the dispute or whether it has been resolved. This debt
is unresolved.
SOR  ¶   1.m   –
This  is  a  delinquent  $263  unsecured  loan  that  was  charged  off.
During  her  2019  interview,  and  in  her  Answer  to  the  FORM,  Applicant  claimed  having
no knowledge about this account. She presented no documentary evidence of efforts to
contact  the  creditor,  or  to  pay,  settle,  or  otherwise  resolve  the  account.  This  debt  is
unresolved.
SOR  ¶   1.p   –   This  was  a  $282  account  placed
for  collection  by  a
telecommunications  services  provider.  Applicant’s  documentary  evidence  shows  she
paid the account on January 28, 2020.
SOR  ¶   1.q  –   This  is  a  $6,374  account  placed  for  collection  by  a  landlord.
Applicant’s  documentary evidence  shows that the creditor offered to settle the account
for less than she owed ($3,200), provided the payment was made by January 28, 2020.
She  presented  no  documentary  evidence  showing  that  she  made  the  payment  or  that
the account was otherwise resolved. The account is unresolved.
SOR  ¶   1.t   –   This  is  a  $406  account  placed  for  collection.  In  her  answer  to  the
SOR, Applicant claimed she paid the debt. The 2020 credit report shows she started a
payment plan in June 2018, but the account is still delinquent, and it was charged off.
The evidence is insufficient to show that the account was resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.u  –   This  was  a  $410  account  placed  for  collection.  Applicant’s
documentary evidence shows she paid the account on January 28, 2020.
SOR  ¶   1.v  –   This  was  a  $72  account  placed
for  collection  by  a
telecommunications  services  provider.  Applicant’s  documentary  evidence  shows  she
paid the account on January 28, 2020.
SOR ¶  1.x –   Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2012 and  her
dischargeable  debts  were  discharged  in  May  2012.  She  explained  during  the  2019
interview that she had too many periods of unemployment, her income was insufficient
to pay her living expenses and her debts, and she fell behind on her debt payments and
had  to  file  for  bankruptcy.  Applicant  stated  that  her  financial  status  was  much  better
after the bankruptcy.
In her Answer to the FORM, Applicant stated her intent to get her finances back
on  track.  In  her  opinion,  her  current  financial  situation  is  good.  She  believes  this  is
proven by a 200-point increase of her credit ratings. She noted that she has eight new
accounts where she has kept current. She also noted that she obtained six new credit
cards with low credit limits to begin rebuilding her credit. Applicant stated that she is not
shirking  on  her  responsibility  to  pay  her  debs.  She  averred  she  is  taking  her  financial
responsibility seriously. She promised to continue paying off her delinquent debts, and
to continue contacting the credit bureau agencies when there are discrepancies in her
financial reports.
Applicant believes her job has provided her with financial stability. She has been
able to excel in her career and achieve her goals. She has been studying and obtaining
certifications  to  prepare  herself  for  job  promotions.  Applicant’s  good  performance  has
allowed  her  to  receive  pay  and  merit  increases  annually.  She  claimed  she  has  been
able to meet her goal to pay all of her bills on time with no delinquencies.
Applicant  did  not  present  evidence  of  her  current  financial  situation  (gross
monthly  income,  deductions,  monthly  expenses,  and  monthly  net  remainder).  She  did
not present evidence to show that she has a working budget. There is some evidence to
show  that  she  sought  assistance  from  a  debt-resolution  company  to  resolve  her
delinquent  debts  in  2017.  However,  she  presented  no  documentary  evidence  to
corroborate that she hired the debt-resolution company, or of what the company did to
help  her  with  her  financial  problems.  There  is  no  evidence  to  show  Applicant  has  had
recent financial counseling.
Applicant  submitted  favorable  references  from  a  manager  and  a  coworker.  The
manager  (M)  has  known  Applicant  for  five  years  in  a  professional  capacity.  In  his
opinion, Applicant has displayed a high degree of integrity, responsibility, and ambition.
Her leadership abilities, work ethic, and accomplishments have been highlighted by her
two promotions. Applicant has been candid with her manager, discussing and keeping
him  abreast  of  her  financial  difficulties.  He  believes  that  she  is  honest,  reliable,  and  a
highly  capable  employee  who  displays  good  judgment.  He  endorses  Applicant’s
eligibility for a clearance without reservations.
Applicant’s  coworker  has known her for  three years. In his opinion,  she is a team
player  who  has  displayed  integrity,   responsibility,  excellent   work  ethic,  and   good
judgment. He highly recommends Applicant’s eligibility for a clearance.
