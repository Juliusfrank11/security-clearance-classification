Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.b through 1.k, and 1.m and 1.n. It
is noted that for the allegations in ¶¶ 1.b through 1.h, she admitted the allegation, but she
disputed the dollar amount alleged. She denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.l.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 56 years old. She earned a high school diploma and a certificate from
a  business  college.  She  married  in  1994  and  has  three  adult  children  and  two  adult
stepchildren. She has worked for her present employer, a federal contractor, since 2014.
(Item 3)
Applicant failed to timely file her 2014, 2015 and  2016 state income tax returns
(SOR ¶ 1.a). She denied this allegation and stated in her answer to the SOR that she has
filed  every  year.  Documents  from  her  state  tax  authority  show  she  did  not  file  for  the
alleged years. Applicant did not provide evidence to show the contrary. (Item 4).
Applicant admitted she failed to timely pay her federal income taxes for tax years
2012 ($9,993); 2013 ($5,887); 2014 ($2,890); 2015 ($1,451); 2016 ($1,831); and 2017
($1,319). The total amount owed is approximately $23,371. (Item  5). In her April 2017
security clearance application she disclosed her failure to pay her 2014 federal income
taxes  because  she  did  not  have  the  money  and  was  in  the  process  of  working  out  a
payment plan with the IRS. (Item 3) In response to interrogatories from December 2019
she said “payment arrangements have been made and are coming out of my husband’s
paycheck.” (Item 4) In her subsequent answer to the SOR, she said that she was “working
diligently  with  the  IRS  to  clear  this  balance.”  (Item  2)  Applicant  failed  to  provide  any
documents  to  substantiate  her  claims  that  she  is  making  payments  on  her  federal  tax
debt.
Applicant admitted she owed all of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, except
the debt in ¶ 1.l ($94), which she said she paid. In her SOR answer, she admitted the
debt in SOR ¶ 1.k ($312) was delinquent, but said she also paid that debt. She stated that
she was having payments deducted automatically from her account monthly to pay the
debt in SOR ¶ 1.m ($17,105). She did not provide documentary proof for any of the claims
she made about paying these debts. Regarding the remaining delinquent debts alleged
in the SOR, she stated in her answer that she is working with the  creditors “to get the
balance  cleared  up.”  Credit  reports  from  October  2020,  April  2020,  and  March  2019
corroborate  the  alleged  debts  as  being  delinquent  and  began  accumulating  in
approximately 2018. These debts total approximately $18,645. (Items 2, 6, 7, 8)
