Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 35 years old. He is a high school graduate. He married in 2008 and
divorced in 2012. He remarried in 2017. He has  two children, ages 12 and 3, and two
stepchildren ages, 7 and 4.
The SOR alleges seven delinquent debts totally approximately $30, 816. Applicant
filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2015. It was dismissed for failing to make the prescribed
payments. In his SOR answer, he explained that he filed bankruptcy because his fiancé
at the time was responsible for paying the bills while he was away. She failed to make the
payments, and he was unaware until he began receiving notices from his creditors. He
then  explained  that  his  bankruptcy  was  dismissed  because  his  employer  had  stopped
making  payments  to  the  bankruptcy  trustee.  He  was  unaware  that  the  payments  had
stopped.  He  filed  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  May  2020,  after  applying  for  a  security
clearance  in  October  2019.  The  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  discharged  was  in  September
2020. (Items 2, 3, 5, 6)
The SOR alleges that Applicant’s child support is past due in the amount of $730
(SOR ¶ 1.b). In his SOR answer, he stated that when he changed jobs in 2019, it took his
employer  45  days  to  begin  an  automatic  draft  for  his  child  support  payments.  In  his
December  2019 background interview with  a government  investigator,  he said  he was
caught up on his child support payments after the delay from his employer. In his SOR
answer, he said in March 2020 he was receiving unemployment benefits and only $117
was being withheld for child support. He said that all of his child support is “cleared except
approximately $180, which was included in my Chapter 7, bankruptcy.” The bankruptcy
documents  clearly  state  that  “domestic  support  obligations”  are  not  dischargeable  in
bankruptcy.  His  December  2019  credit  report  lists  his  child  support  in  arrears  in  the
amount of $730. This was prior to a period of unemployment.  Documents provided by
Applicant show that his monthly obligation is $510, and he occasionally does not pay the
full amount, but extra is withheld during subsequent months. His document reflects that
as of July 2020, he was in arrears for $180. (Items 1, 2, 4, 6, 7)
Applicant’s largest debt is for a repossessed vehicle (SOR ¶ 1.c; $26,524-charged
off).  It  appears  the  vehicle  was  purchased  for  $41,039  in  2014.  In  his  background
interview, he told the investigator that his former wife handled all of the bills and he was
unaware this account was delinquent. He could not recall the date he opened the account
or  when  it  became  delinquent.  The  account  was  held  individually  by  Applicant.  It  was
included  in  his  Chapter  13  bankruptcy,  but  when  that  was  dismissed  he  returned  the
vehicle to the creditor. The amount owed was the deficiency. Applicant said he attempted
to  reach  a  payment  agreement  with  the  creditor,  but  was  unsuccessful.  He  told  the
investigator he would call the creditor within the week to make an agreement to pay the
debt. In his SOR answer, Applicant stated: “I admit that I was delinquent to [creditor]. As
of the date of this letter my debt with [creditor] has been cleared and closed stating paid
in full.” Later in his SOR answer, he said: “In January 2020, I made an agreement with
[creditor] in the amount of $100 every month until paid off. All of my outstanding debt was
included in my Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. All accounts are paid in full and states closed as of
the date of this letter.” (Item 2) He failed to provide any information for why he failed to
pay  this  debt.  His  Chapters  13  and  7  bankruptcy  documents  and  his  December  2019
credit report reflect the account was opened in February 2014. This purchase was made
two years after his divorce. (Items 2, 4, 6, 7)
The debts  alleged in the SOR  were discharged  in  Chapter 7 bankruptcy, except
the child support obligation. The debts in  SOR ¶¶ 1.d ($1,219);  1.e ($1,107);  1.f  ($507);
1.g ($389);  and  1.h ($304)  are all medical  debts.  In his December 2019 interview,  he told
the investigator that he was going to call  the creditors within a week and  find out if the
accounts belonged to him,  and  if  they did he would satisfy them. In  his SOR answer,  he
admitted owing the debts and including them in his bankruptcy. Applicant did not provide
an explanation for why he failed to pay these debts. (Items 2, 7)
The debts alleged in the SOR are established by Applicant’s SOR answer; a credit
report from December 2019; Chapter 7 bankruptcy documents; and his statements to a
government
to  a  period  of
unemployment  for  his  failure  to  pay  his  child  support,  but  failed  to  provide  specific
information on when it started, how long he was unemployed, or his financial situation at
that time. He did not provide any current financial information. (Items 2, 4, 6, 7)
