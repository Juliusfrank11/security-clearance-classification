The  SOR  alleges  13  delinquent  accounts  in  collection  or  charged  off,  totaling
about  $23,419.  In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  10  of  the  financial  allegations
(SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.i  and  1.m).  He  denied  the  factual  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.j
through 1.l. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough
review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  aircraft  mechanic.  He  is  a  high  school  graduate.  He
enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in December 2002, and served honorably on active duty
until his discharge in February 2017. He possessed a security clearance during most of
his service.
Applicant married in 2004 and divorced in July 2012. He remarried in December
2012,  separated  in  May  2016,  and  divorced  in  April  2019.  He  disclosed  having  no
children  in  his  2019  SCA.  However,  Applicant  told  the  government  background
investigator during his June 2019 interview that he has two children (ages unknown) for
whom he provides financial support.
In  January  2017,  Applicant  was  hired  by  his  current  employer  and  security
sponsor, a federal contractor. In response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his March
2019  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  had  financial  problems,  which  included
arrearages on his children’s financial support, owing money to the Defense Finance and
Accounting Service (DFAS) for an overpayment, and another delinquent account.
Applicant  explained  that  his  financial problems  started when he and his  second
wife  returned  to  the  United  States  from  an  overseas  assignment.  Apparently,  their
earnings decreased when they lost their overseas cost of living allowance. Additionally,
upon their return, they separated and he was financially responsible for two households.
During  the  marital  separation,  from  May  2016  through  April  2019,  Applicant  agreed  to
provide monthly financial support of $900 - $1,000 for his two children. When the court
finalized  the  divorce,  he  was  ordered  to  provide  $2,262  in  monthly  child  support,
retroactively. He incurred automatic child support arrearages for the difference between
what he was providing and what the court ordered in financial support. Applicant stated
that he was never late or delinquent on his children’s financial support payments.
The status of the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR follows:
1.a.  This  is  a  charged-off  account  for  $3,352.  During  his  June  2019  interview,
Applicant claimed he had no knowledge of this account. The account is established by
all the credit reports in evidence. (Items 4-6) In his SOR answer, Applicant claimed the
contacted  the  creditor  and  made  arrangements  to  pay  the  account.  He  presented  no
documentary evidence to corroborate his claims.
1.b.  This  is  a  charged-off  account  for  $5,325.  The  account  is  established  by  all
the  credit  reports  in  evidence.  (Items  4-6)  In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  claimed  the
contacted  the  creditor  and  made  arrangements  to  pay  the  account.  He  presented  no
documentary evidence to corroborate his claim.
1.c.  This is a collection account for $2,132. (Item 6) The account is unresolved.
1.d.  This  was  a  collection  on  behalf  of  a  communications  provider  for  $595.
Applicant  settled  the  account  for  less  than  owed  and  paid  it  off  in  September  2020.
(Item 6)
1.e. This was a charged-off account for $492. Applicant paid it off in September
2020. (Item 6)
1.f. This was a collection for $119. Applicant paid it off in September 2020. (Item
6)
1.g. This was a past-due account with a total balance of $5,068. Applicant paid it
off in September 2020. (Item 6)
1.h.  This  was  a  past-due  account  with  a  total  balance  of  $4,130.  The  credit
reports reflect several account for A. F. Bank (all of which have been paid and closed)
and  several  accounts  for  A.  F.  Loans  (all  of  which  shows  that  the  accounts  are  being
paid as agreed). It is not clear from the evidence presented what account was alleged
as delinquent. Regardless, the accounts are either current or paid off.
1.i.  This  is  a  collection  on  behalf  of  a  lender  for  $1,955.  The  credit  report  from
December 2020 (Item 6) shows the account is still outstanding.
1.j. This is a collection on behalf of communications provider for $744. The debt
is reflected only in the April 2019 credit report. Applicant claimed he paid the account.
The  account  is  not  reflected  in  the  May  2019  or  December  2020  credit  reports.  The
account is resolved.
1.k.  This is a collection on behalf of communications provider for $482. The debt
is  reflected  in  the  April  and  May  2019  credit  reports.  Applicant  claimed  he  paid  the
account,  and  it  is  not  reflected  in  the  December  2020  credit  report.  The  account  is
resolved.
1.l. This is a collection on behalf of a communications provider for $287. The debt
is reflected only in the April 2019 credit report. Applicant claimed he paid the account,
and it is not reflected in the May 2019 or December 2020 credit reports. The account is
resolved.
1.m.  This  is  a  collection  on  behalf  of  a  gas  company  for  $169.  The  debt  is
reflected only in the April 2019 credit report. Applicant claimed he paid the account and
it is reflected as paid in the May 2019 and December 2020 credit reports. The account
is resolved.
During  his  June  2019  interview,  Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  he  was
making  $7,400  in  monthly  income:  $4,400  from  his  current  employment,  and  $3,000
from  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA).  In  addition  to  the  $2,262  monthly  child
support  payments,  he  disclosed  the  following  monthly  expenses:  $1,500  in  rent  and
utilities;  $200 for  food and groceries;  $350  for  car  payment;  $200 for  gas;  $675  in car
and  renters’  insurance;  $230  in  loan  payments;  $190  cell  phone  payment;  $200  for
internet  and  cable;  $60  on  miscellaneous  subscriptions;  and  $100-$200  in  children
visitation expenses. Applicant has about $1,300 of discretionary income after paying his
monthly expenses. (Item 3)
Applicant  believes  that  his  financial  situation  is  stable.  He  is  current  with  his
present financial obligations and promised to continue to meet them. He also promised
to continue paying his delinquent accounts with his discretionary income until they are
resolved.  In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  claimed  the  he  had  contacted  his  creditors  to
either  resolve  or  make  arrangements  to  resolve  his  delinquencies.  He  did  not  submit
documentary  evidence  to  corroborate  his  efforts  to  contact  all  of  his  creditors.
Nevertheless, the credit reports in evidence corroborate his contacts with creditors and
the payment or resolution of at least nine SOR debts.
Applicant  accepted  responsibility  for  his  delinquent  accounts.  He  admitted  that
after his divorce he failed to follow up on many of the delinquent accounts because he
believed  they  were  his  ex-wife’s  accounts.  Applicant’s  credit  reports  show  that  he  is
living  within  his  financial  means,  and  that  he  has  acquired  no  additional  delinquent
accounts. Although Applicant presented no evidence to show he has received financial
counseling, he has been paying his delinquent accounts.
Applicant’s  current  job  allows  him  to  meet  his  financial  obligations  and  living
expenses. His credit reports show that he has paid or resolved nine of the 13 accounts
alleged  in  the  SOR,  paying  approximately  $11,799.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  through  1.h  and  1.j
through 1.m). He has yet to resolve the accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c and
1.i,  totaling  about  $11,620.  Applicant  promised  to  pay  all  of  his  remaining  delinquent
accounts. Because he already paid nine delinquent accounts, I find his promise to pay
the remaining delinquent accounts credible.
