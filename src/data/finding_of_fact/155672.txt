1.h.,  1.k.,  and  1m.  Credit  reports  of  the  Applicant  dated  October  9,  2019;  and
November  12,  2020,  confirm  that  he  is  indebted  to  each  of  the  creditors  listed  in  the

further.
On  November  15,  2019,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  DoD-authorized
investigator.  During the interview, Applicant was confronted with several delinquencies
that he had not disclosed on the e-QIP, some of which he states he was not aware of at
the  time  he  filed  the  e-QIP.  At  that  time,  Applicant  had  not  made  any  payment
arrangements  on  the  debts  nor  had  he  received  any  credit  counseling  or  debt
consolidation services.
In  August  2020,  in  an  effort  to  address  his  delinquent  debts,  Applicant  hired  a
debt  resolution  company  to  assist  him  in  negotiating  settlements  with  his  creditors  to
resolve his debts.  He enrolled debts totaling $13,307 with the company, which includes
six accounts listed in the SOR.

1.m.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a collection account in the amount of

There  is  insufficient  evidence  in  the  record  to  show  that  Applicantâ€™s  delinquent
debts  have  been  resolved.  In  August  2020,  Applicant  retained  the  services  of  a  debt
resolution company to help him settle his delinquent accounts for less than the balance
due.  Six  of  the  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  totaling  $13,307  are  included  in  the  debt
resolution settlement program.  Applicant has not submitted any evidence showing that
he has made any payments in accordance with the agreement.  In regard to those debts
that  were  not  included  in  the  debt  resolution  settlement  program,  Applicant  has  not
shown  that  he  has  addressed  them.  There  is  no  proof  of  payments,  receipts,  or  any
other  documentation  to  show  that  he  has  paid  off  or  is  paying  any  of  his  outstanding
debts.  His  credit  reports  do not show that  any of  his  debts  have been resolved.  The
effort he has made, which was to hire the debt resolution company, is not enough, and
was done at such a late date that its meaning is insignificant.  He has also not provided
information regarding the delinquent accounts he disputes or the basis for the disputes.
Overall,  Applicant  shows  no  progress  towards  resolving  his  debts.  He  still  owes  a
significant  amount  of  money  to  his  creditors  that  he  obviously  cannot  afford  to  pay.
There  is  insufficient  evidence  in  the  record  to  show  that  the  Applicant  has  carried  his
burden  of  proof  to  establish  mitigation  of  the  government  security  concerns  under
Guideline F.
