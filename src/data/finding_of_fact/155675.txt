Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  owes  $42,534  for  ten
delinquent  debts  (SOR  1.a  –  1.j).  Under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant
intentionally falsified her responses to questions in e-QIP Section 26 (Financial Record)
when she failed to list the debts alleged at SOR 1.a – 1.i. (SOR 2.a)
In response, Applicant admitted with explanations the allegations at SOR 1.a – 1.j.
Her Answer (FORM, Item 2) consisted of a one-page statement, a two-page response to
each SOR allegation, and 16-pages of documents in support thereof organized by each
Guideline  F  allegation.  As  to  SOR  2.a,  Applicant  in  her  one-page  statement  denied
intentionally withholding adverse financial information from her e-QIP. In addition to the
facts established by Applicant’s admissions, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor,  for whom she has
worked  since  September  2019,  and  who  is  sponsoring  her  request  for  a  security
clearance. After graduating from college in June 2017, Applicant worked for two years for
a different company in a similar position; however, she did not require a security clearance
for that job. This is her first application for clearance. (FORM, Items 3 and 4)
Applicant disclosed in her e-QIP the delinquent utility bill alleged at SOR 1.j, stating
that she was in the process of setting up a repayment plan. She also listed a $706 state
income-tax debt for the 2018 tax year, which she paid off in September 2019; and a past-
due $234 debt for unpaid insurance premiums, also paid off in September 2019. By the
language  of  e-QIP  Section  26  questions  about  delinquent  routine  accounts,  and  as
documented by a credit report obtained by investigators shortly after she submitted her
e-QIP, Applicant also should have listed the debts at SOR 1.a – 1.i. During a personal
subject  interview  (PSI)  with  a  government  investigator  on  October  7,  2019,  and  in
response to the SOR, Applicant attributed her omissions of this information to confusion
about what information the questionnaire required. (FORM, Items 2 – 4)
Applicant’s   financial  problems  began  when  she  moved  in   with  her  now-ex-
boyfriend  in  February  2018.  They  lived   together  until   she  ended   the  relationship  and
moved in  with her  parents in  January 2019.  During  that  relationship,  Applicant claims  she
had  to pay most  of their joint living expenses and  debts. The  debts at SOR 1.d, and  1.g
–  1.j  were incurred and became delinquent during her relationship with her ex-boyfriend.
Applicant paid off SOR 1.h in  November 2019, and  completed a repayment plan for  SOR
1.i in   March 2020.  The   debts  at SOR 1.g  and   1.j   were   paid off   in   September  2020.  In
October 2020, Applicant began a  $250 per month repayment plan to resolve SOR 1.d,
which   is  the balance  due   after  resale   of  a  car  that  was  repossessed  in   October  2018.
(FORM, Item 2 - Appendix A; Items 3 –  6)
Applicant incurred the debts alleged at SOR 1.a – 1.c, 1.e and 1.f before moving
in with her ex-boyfriend. They became delinquent because she was saddled with paying
most of their financial obligations for about 11 months. SOR 1.a – 1.c are being resolved
through  a  debt-repayment  plan  established  through  a  credit-counseling  company  in
September 2020. That plan calls for resolution of her three largest debts through a single
monthly payment of $1,099 over the next three years. The credit-counseling service also
helped  Applicant  review  her  monthly  budget  and  determine  that  after  her  expenses,
including all of her ongoing debt payments, she has about $1,900 remaining. Because
she lives with her parents, Applicant has no housing costs such as mortgage or rent. She
has not incurred any new delinquencies and she has about $24,000 in savings. (FORM,
Item 2 - Appendix A)
