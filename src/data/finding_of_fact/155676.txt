In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted,  with  brief  comments,  all  of  the
factual  allegations  pertaining  to  financial  considerations  (SOR  ¶  1.a.).  Applicant’s
admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete
and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same,
I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a network engineer with his current employer since June 2017. He previously worked
for  various  employers  in  a  variety  of  positions,  including  systems  engineer;  desk-side
technician; domain administrator; and network-support technician. A 2004 graduate, he
earned some college credits, but no degree. He has never served with the U.S. military.
While Applicant claimed in 2018 that he had an active secret clearance, it is unclear when
that clearance was granted to him. (Item 5, at 36) Applicant has never been married. He
has no children.
Financial Considerations
Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for the tax
years 2012, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, essentially claiming that he had anxiety
and  depression  and  was  unable  to  locate  required  documentation  to  timely  file  those
income  tax  returns.  He  did  not  submit  medical  documentation  to  reflect  the  degree  of
depression and anxiety, or to describe any treatment he may have received to alleviate
those conditions. He claimed that he had finally engaged the services of a tax expert, but
failed to indicate when that engagement took place. The timeline covering his actions or
inactions regarding his filings is as follows:
(2012):  The  federal  income  tax  return  was  completed  on  November  3,  2020  –
nearly two months after the SOR was issued – and the state income tax return, although
undated, was reportedly either E-filed or mailed by November 6, 2020.  (GE 4, at 1-5; GE
6, at 10)
(2013):  Both  the  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  were  completed  on
November 2, 2020, and were reportedly either E-filed or mailed by November 6, 2020.
(GE 4, at 1, 6-10; GE 6, at 4, at 1)
(2016): Creating some confusion, Applicant submitted two differently dated copies
of his federal income tax return. One is dated November 2, 2020, and the other one is
dated March 23, 2020. Nevertheless, he claimed that both the federal and state income
tax returns were completed on November 2, 2020, and were reportedly either E-filed or
mailed by November 6, 2020. (GE 4, at 1, 11-16; GE 6, at 4, 11-12)
(2017): The federal income tax return was completed by his tax preparer on March
23, 2020. He did not submit a copy of his state income tax return. Applicant claimed that
both the federal and state income tax returns were reportedly either E-filed or mailed by
November 6, 2020. (GE 4, at 1, 17-18; GE 6, at 4, 13-14)
(2018): The federal income tax return was completed by his tax preparer on March
23, 2020, and the state income tax return was completed on November 2, 2020. Applicant
claimed that both the federal and state income tax returns were reportedly either E-filed
or mailed by November 6, 2020. (GE 4, at 1, 22-25; GE 6, at 4, 15)
(2019):  Both  the  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  were  completed  on
November 2, 2020. Applicant claimed that both the federal and state income tax returns
were reportedly either E-filed or mailed by November 6, 2020. (GE 4, at 1, 19-21)
