Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  her  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the  pleadings,  including  Applicant’s  admissions  in  her  Answer  to  both  of  the  SOR
allegations,  her  testimony,  and  the  documentary  evidence  in  the  record,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 61 years old. She has two adult children, ages 33 and 23. She was
married for 21 years and divorced in 2006. She lives with her youngest child, who is a
student and works part time. Applicant has a high school diploma and has taken some
college courses in nursing. (Tr. at 15-16, 21.)
Applicant works as a senior administrative associate for a DoD contractor. She has
worked  for  this  contractor  for  about  35  years.  She  presently  earns  about  $50,000  per
year.  She  is  a  first-time  applicant  for  a  security  clearance.  She  works  in  the  training
department of her employer. The company’s Project Management  was obliged to have
one employee at her location obtain a security clearance to process security clearance
training classes. Applicant was requested to apply. She reluctantly agreed and submitted
her SCA knowing that she had two unresolved financial delinquencies. (Tr. at 17-19, 25.)
In  October 2017,  Applicant  defaulted  on the  payment  of  two credit  cards  with  a
combined indebtedness of about $38,000. She received and continues to receive spousal
support of $303 per month. In 2017 and for a period before then, her expenses exceeded
her  income,  which  caused  her  to  accumulate  this  credit-card  debt.  She  got  to  a  point
where the cost of paying the debts exceeded her ability  to pay the monthly payments.
She only has these two credit cards and one store charge card. At the same time as her
default on the credit cards, she was diagnosed with cancer, resulting in some medical
expenses that were not fully covered by her employer-provided medical insurance. Her
treatment ended in December 2017, and she has been cancer-free for over three years.
She has ongoing medical expenses, however,  to monitor her condition. (Tr. at 23-29, 35-
36.)
Applicant  wanted  to  address  her  two  outstanding  debts  by filing  for  bankruptcy.
She  received  advice  that  a  bankruptcy  filing  would  not  be  disqualifying  for  a  security
clearance, so she proceeded to begin the process with a bankruptcy attorney. She paid
the necessary legal fees and filled out the paperwork, but then stopped due to her cancer
diagnosis. She restarted the process three months ago, but nothing happened and she
must start over again. (Tr. at 20-21, 23-25, 32-34.)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  explained   that  since  her  divorce  in   2006,  she  has
struggled to maintain  a household as a single  mother on a limited income and with only
modest help from  her  former husband. Paying her rent  and  other necessities required her
to go into debt on her credit cards.  At the hearing, she was unable to explain in  detail
what expenses she incurred. She has never prepared a budget, except in  connection with
her  bankruptcy  preparation.  She  has  never  sought   financial  assistance  to  help  her
manage her finances and debts. In 2010, she moved out of an expensive apartment and
has lived in a less expensive apartment  since 2011. She owns a car,  but  does not have
a  car  loan.  Repairing   her  car  and   insuring   it  has   been  expensive.   She  is  planning  to
prepare her 2020 tax  return soon,  which  is a  necessary step prior  to  filing for  bankruptcy.
She expects to  owe $3,000 to  $4,000  in  taxes for 2020.  She intends to  pay  her tax  liability
out of  her 401k account, which  has a balance of  about $170,000. (Tr. at 24-28,  33-35, 37-
38.)
