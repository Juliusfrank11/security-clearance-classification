In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a-1.d with
explanations, and he denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f. (Item 1) He did not
provide  any  supporting  documentation  about  the  status  or  resolution  of  his  delinquent
debts. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant is 58 years old, and he has been employed as a Configuration Analyst
since September 2016. (Item 2 at 11) From July 1989 to June 2016, he was continuously
employed as an Engineering Technologist II working for the same employer. (Id. at 12)
He served in the Navy from March 1982 to February 1988. (Id. at 14-15) He received an
honorable discharge. (Id. at 15)
Applicant is currently estranged from his spouse, whom he married in 1988. (Item
2 at 19) He does not have any children. (Id.) In 2007, Applicant received an associate’s
degree. (Id. at 10) He attended college from 2007 to 2009. (Id.) There is no evidence of
workplace misconduct, abuse of alcohol, use of illegal drugs, or criminal conduct. He did

Financial Considerations
According  to Applicant’s  August 29, 2018 Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
personal  subject  interview  (PSI), his budget is as follows: monthly gross income is $6,562;
monthly net income is $4,104; monthly expenses  are $2,221; monthly debt payments are
$2,746  (comprised  of mortgage ($953),  credit cards ($1,616),  and  miscellaneous ($177));
and net remainder is negative $863. (Item 8) His spouse’s income  is as follows: monthly
gross income is $3,100; monthly net income is $2,383; and monthly retirement is $1,115.
(Id.)  Applicant and  his spouse  live in  the  same residence; however, they are estranged
because of  her infidelity. (Id.) As of August 29, 2018, he was receiving  $1,000 monthly
from   his  spouse  to  address  their  marital  debts.   (Id.)  He   has  not  received   any  credit
counseling. (Id.)
According to Applicant’s SOR response, when Applicant and his wife separated,
her net monthly income was $2,000. (Item 2) For 42 months after they were separated,
she provided Applicant $1,000 monthly for bills; however, this was insufficient to keep his
debts  in  current  status.  (Id.)  Currently,  she  is  not  providing  any  funds  to  address  their
debts. (Id.) He said he is making progress on his finances, and intends to pay his debts.
(Id.) Applicant  was unemployed  for  two months  from July to  September  2016,  and his
separation  from  his  spouse  and  unemployment  for  two  months  contributed  to  his
problematic financial situation. (Item 8) His most recent credit report of record shows that
he paid several non-SOR debts, and several accounts are current. (Item 7)
The SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling $122,685 as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a is a judgment for  $60,630 based on a debt owed to a credit union. (Item
1)   The   court  entered  a  judgment  in   November  2018,  and   a  garnishment  order   in
September  2019.  (Item  4)  In  September  2020,  Applicant  said   he  has  counsel   and   is
negotiating a reduction in the magnitude of the debt. (Item 2)
SOR ¶ 1.b is a judgment entered in 2018 for $38,913 based on a debt owed to a
credit card entity. (Item 1) In December 2016, a Joint Stipulation of Settlement was filed
with  the  court.  (Item  5)  In  August  2017,  a  judgment  was  entered  against  Applicant  for
$38,913. (Id.) In December 2017, a copy of the garnishment writ was mailed to Applicant’s
employer.  (Id.)  In  September  2020,  Applicant  said  the  debt  was  paid  down  to  $1,000
through  garnishment  of  his  wages,  and  will  be  fully  paid  in  October  2020.  (Item  2)
Completion of the garnishment was delayed when the address for the creditor changed
without notice to Applicant’s human relations department. (Id.)
SOR ¶ 1.c is a judgment entered in 2019 for $11,686 based on a debt owed to a

delinquent in April 2017, and the creditor closed the account and charged it off. (Item 7)
SOR ¶ 1.f is a charged-off debt owed to a department store for $1,159. (Item 1) In

(Item 7)
In  the  FORM,  Department   Counsel  noted  the  absence  of  corroborating  or
supporting   documentation  of  resolution  of  the  SOR  debts.   Aside  from  Applicant’s
uncorroborated  statements,   credit  reports,  and  evidence   of  the  judgments   and
garnishments,  there  was  no  documentary  corroborating  evidence  that  Applicant  paid,
arranged to pay, settled, compromised, or otherwise resolved any of the SOR debts. The
FORM informed Applicant that he had 30 days from the receipt of the FORM “in which
to submit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation,
mitigation, or explanation, as appropriate. If you do not file any objections or submit
any additional information . . . your case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for
a  determination  based  solely”  on  the  evidence  set  forth  in  this  FORM.  (FORM  at  4
(emphasis added)) Applicant did not provide any response to the FORM.
Applicant  did  not  present  any  supporting  documentary  evidence  of  his  current
income  (such  as pay statements from his  employer),  current  budget  as of the date he
received the FORM, receipts from creditors showing payments, or a timeline for resolving
the  delinquent  SOR  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.d,  1.e,  and  1.f.  He  did  not  present  any
evidence of written offers to settle, or other correspondence to or from these four SOR
creditors.
