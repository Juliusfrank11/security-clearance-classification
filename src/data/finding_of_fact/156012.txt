Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  39  years  old.  He  was  born  in  Kuwait.  He  immigrated  to  the  United
States in 2000 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2009. He has a bachelor’s degree
from an American university. (Tr. 16-17, 44; GE 1)
Applicant married in 2003 and divorced in 2009. He remarried in Jordan in 2013 to
a  Jordanian  citizen.  His  wife  moved  to  the  United  States  in  2015  and  is  a  permanent
resident. They have no children. Applicant paid a substantial amount for the wedding, but
testified he could not recall how much exactly he spent. His wife also contributed “a little
bit too.” (Tr. 45). He is his wife’s sole provider. (Tr. 17-18, 44-45, 62; GE 1; AE B, C, D)
In late 2018, Applicant and his wife returned to Kuwait so he could try and get a
job at the U.S. embassy. From there she traveled to Jordan in late 2018 and has remained
there because her father was sick. Applicant did not get a job in Kuwait, so in April 2019,
he returned to the U.S. from Kuwait. His wife stayed in Jordan while he continued to look
for  work  in  the  United  States.  He  explained  that  he  wanted  to  get  a  job  and  get  the
household settled before she returned to the U.S. and it was easier for him to do it alone.
His wife has been caring for her father since then and plans to return to the United States
in the next few weeks. He provided a copy of her airline ticket. She has a special re-entry
visa that permitted her to remain outside of the United States for longer than six-months.
She was a pharmacist assistant and hopes to continue her studies in the U.S. and to seek
citizenship  when  she  is  eligible.  She  has  no  assets  in  Jordan.  Her  father  is  a  retired
teacher and her mother is a homemaker. They have no ties to the Jordanian government.
(Tr. 25-35, 59, 62-66, 72; AE J, O, P)
Applicant  has  one  sibling,  a  sister,  who  was  born  in  Kuwait  and  is  a  citizen  of
Germany, living in Lebanon. She teaches at an American school there. She is married to
a  German  national  and  has  two  children.  He  is  a  lawyer  who  splits  his  time  between
Germany and Lebanon. Applicant speaks to his sister about every six months, and they
last  visited  together in the  United  States  in 2014.  She  traveled  to the  United  States  in
2016  and  was  a  visiting  professor  at  a  university.  Applicant  and  his  sister  did  not  visit
each  other  at  that  time.  His  father  and  mother  are  permanent  residents  of  the  United
States. (Tr. 35-41, 66-68)
Applicant testified that he came to the United States when he was 18 years old.
He  has  been  a  refugee  all  of  his  life  and  the  U.S.  is  the  only  place  that  gave  him  an
opportunity  and  a  sense  of  belonging.  He  was  in  Kuwait  during  the  Gulf  War  and
afterwards he and his family traveled to find a place to settle.  He considers the United
States his home. (Tr. 41-42)
Applicant disclosed in his September 2017 security clearance application (SCA)
his  prior  work  history.  From  September  2007  to  March  2011,  he  was  an  office
administrator. From March 2011 to August 2017, he was a sales representative. He was
primarily  unemployed  from  October  2017  to  April  2019.  In  about  November  2017,  he
began working for a federal contractor, but this was not a full-time job and he only worked
sporadically when he was called in. The last time he was called in to work was from April
2018  to  September  2018.  He  was  able  to  collect  unemployment  benefit for about four
weeks, but it was insufficient to cover all of his expenses. In April 2019, he worked for a
wholesale  food  company until July 2020  when  he  lost  his job  due to  the  pandemic.  In
November 2020, he began work as a district manager for a food distribution company.
(Tr. 18, 21-25, 45-50; GE 1, AE E)
Applicant testified that in 2014 his father needed emergency surgery and was later
diagnosed  with  cancer.  Applicant  traveled  to  Lebanon  to  be  with  his  father  where  the
surgery was to take place. His father did not have the financial resources to pay for his
medical needs. Applicant made the choice to help his father financially and  used credit
cards to pay for the medical expenses. Applicant testified that he made some payments
towards the credit card delinquencies in about 2017, but due to his underemployment he
has not been able to repay his debts. Applicant testified that he has not paid the credit
card debts alleged in the SOR because he is recovering financially and is helping support
his family and wife. (Tr. 19-21; AE K)
Applicant  testified  that  he  intends  to  repay  his  delinquent  debts.  After  Applicant
completed  his  SCA  in  September  2017,  he  became  aware  that  his  finances  were  a
security concern. He provided a document to show he participated in financial counseling
in January 2020, and he discussed his personal financial situation with the counselor in
detail. He supplied the counselor with information needed to provide him with options and
they discussed workable solutions that would help improve his finances. (AE A) He never
executed the proposed plan. He did not provide any supporting documents to show he
has made any payments toward resolving his debts. (Tr. 52-53)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($8,146) is a credit card debt and his March 2019 credit
report shows there has been no activity on the account since October 2014. Applicant
could not recall if he contacted the creditor. He testified that he has not made any effort
to negotiate a settlement or pay this debt.  (Tr. 53-54; GE 3) The debts in SOR  ¶¶ 1.b
through 1.j appear on his May 2021 credit report. Applicant has four delinquent accounts
with the same collection company. The debts date back to 2014 and it appears a minimal
payment was made on each account in 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.b-balance $4,575-payment-$55;
¶  1.d-balalnce  $3,424-payment-$41;  ¶  1.g-balance  $1,676-payment-$20;  and  ¶  1.h-
balance $1,268-payment-$15). No other payments were made on these accounts or on
any of the other SOR delinquent debts. He has not contacted any of these creditors to
negotiate settlements or resolve the debts. (Tr. 54-58; GE 5)
Applicant’s current annual salary is approximately $56,000. He has no savings and
is living paycheck to paycheck. He has no other assets.  The debts alleged in the SOR
are  corroborated  by  Applicant’s  admissions  and  credit  reports  from  November  2017,
September 2018, March 2019, February 2020, and May 2021.(Tr. 58-59, 69; GE 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7)
Applicant  provided  character  letters.  His  work  performance  is  described  as
exemplary  while  performing  as  a  role  player.  He  is  also  described  as  dedicated,
intelligent,  self-disciplined,  open-minded,  respectful  and  respected,  productive,  and  an
effective communicator and listener. (AE L, M)
