Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d and 1.i. He denied
the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.f.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,
testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  52   years  old.   He   is  a   high   school  graduate   and   has   some   college
credits, but not a  degree. He married  in 1993  and  has four children, ages 28, 26, 23, and
17. They   all   live   at  home.  The   two   oldest   are   employed.   Applicant   served   in  the  Army
Reserve  from  1992  to  2000  and  was honorably  discharged  in the  paygrade  of  E-2. He
has  worked   for  his  present   employer,  a   federal  contractor,   since   October  2016   as  a
mechanical engineer and  currently  earns  approximately  $97,000. He  has worked  in the
past for other  federal contractors, as  an  independent  contractor, and  in non-government
jobs.  His  wife   is  also  employed   and   currently   earns  approximately   $100,000   per  year.
Applicant testified  that  he  has held a  security  clearance  for about 20  years.  (Tr. 39-45;
GE 1)
In December 2016, Applicant completed a security clearance application. In it he
disclosed that he “failed to file by the tax deadline” his federal income tax returns for 2008
through  2012  and  failed  to  pay  the  taxes  owed.  He  disclosed  that  he  “missed  filing
deadline” for tax years 2013 through 2015. He disclosed that he was currently working on
a  payment  plan  with  the  IRS for tax years 2008  through  2015.  He estimated he owed
approximately $3,000 each year for tax years 2008 through 2012 and $1,000 for  each
year from 2013 to 2015. He admitted in his answer to the SOR that he did not timely file
state income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2015 when he lived in two different
states  that  require  income  tax  filings.  He  did  not  disclose  this  information  in  his  SCA.
Applicant’s failure to disclose his state tax issues will not be considered for disqualifying
purposes, but may be considered in  the whole  person analysis,  in  mitigation,  and in a
credibility determination. (GE 1, 2)
Applicant testified  that  when  he  had  completed  his 2016  SCA he  had  been  in direct
contact with  the  IRS  about his taxes. He said he  was attempting  to  “work something  out.”
(Tr. 96) He then  said that the  IRS  never contacted  him  by  email  or mail  after that time. He
said he never had a payment plan with the IRS. (Tr. 97) After  completing his SCA, he
failed to file his 2017 federal income tax return and a state income tax return for the state
he had lived in for 10 months. (Tr. 97-99)
In  August  2018,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  under
oath. During the interview, he stated that he failed to file his federal taxes on time and
was currently working out a payment plan with the IRS for tax years 2014 through 2016.
He indicated he owed about $3,000 for each year. He admitted he had not been diligent
with his finances and did not consider the seriousness of not filing tax returns on time. He
stated he contacted the IRS on March 23, 2018, and was informed he owed taxes for tax
years 2014 through 2016. He said his mother-in-law is a certified tax preparer, and she
was currently in the process of taking care of his tax returns from 2014 to 2017. He said
he had filed his tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2013, but not 2014 through 2016.
Applicant told the investigator that he cannot recall having any contact with IRS officials
prior to March 23, 2018. This contradicts his statement in his 2016 SCA where he said he
was currently working with the IRS on a payment plan and his testimony. In his statement
to the investigator, he said that he attempted to contact the IRS by telephone, but never
made contact with a representative. He testified at his hearing that he attempted to reach
out  to  the  IRS,  but  they  never  got  back  him.  (Tr.  100-102)  I  did  not  find  Applicant’s
testimony credible.
Applicant acknowledged to the investigator that in June 2008 he filed Chapter 13
bankruptcy because he had approximately $50,000 of debt due to  a car repossession,
his son’s medical expenses, and student loans. He did not have a steady job at the time,
and  although  his  and  his  wife’s  household  income  was  approximately  $90,000,  it  was
used  to  pay  their  living  expenses.  He  stated  he  had  no  other  options  than  to  file
bankruptcy  and  start  fresh.  (GE  5)  The  bankruptcy  documents  show  the  case  was
dismissed in  June  2010 for failure to make plan  payments.  (GE 9) Applicant  also filed
Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2000 and the plan was discharged in 2005. (GE 10) Applicant
testified that he did not recall the earlier bankruptcy. I did not find his testimony credible.
This bankruptcy was not alleged in the SOR and will not be considered for disqualifying
purposes, but may be considered for the same purposes as noted above. (Tr. 74-76, 118-
120)
Applicant acknowledged to the investigator he was aware of  the debt alleged in
SOR ¶ 1.d ($13,412) for a charged-off account. He explained it was a car loan. He gave
the car to his son who was unable to make the payments. The car was repossessed in
2013. He stated he intended to contact the creditor and resolve the debt. (GE 5) In his
answer to the SOR, he stated the debt was from the repossession that took place in 2014
and is being scrutinized. He hired an attorney to assist him to determine if the amount
owed  is  accurate,  if  the  debt  should  be  dismissed;  and  if  the  amount  is  accurate  to
determine if a settlement amount or payment plan will be acceptable. Applicant testified
that he last had contact with the creditor in April 2020. He is determining what the best
approach is regarding the debt. He did not provide evidence of actions he has taken to
resolve this debt that he has been aware of for years. The debt is unresolved.
In  response  to  Government  interrogatories  from  September  2019,  Applicant
disclosed that he had filed his federal income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2013,
but had not filed for 2014 through 2018. He indicated the estimated amount owed for tax
years 2008 through 2013 was approximately $57,642, presumably this does not include
penalties and interest. He did not indicate an amount he estimated he owed for tax years
2014 through 2018. (Tr. 80; GE 2)
Applicant stated in his interrogatories that he was currently working with a tax firm
to file his federal income tax returns for 2014 through 2018, and he would have them filed
before the end of 2019.  He also stated he was  working with the tax firm to assist with
establishing a repayment plan with the IRS before the end of 2019. Regarding his state
income tax returns, he said he was also working with the tax firm to contact the two states
where he had lived and was required to file, to request information, but at that time he
had not received the requested documents. He provided copies of IRS Form 4506-T that
requests transcripts of federal tax returns for years 2008 through 2018. (Tr. 102-106; GE
2)
Applicant sent an email to a Government representative on October 4, 2019, as a
supplement to the September 2019 Government interrogatories. The email stated:
The  attached  tax  documents are what  the  accounting  firm  will be  filing  once
I apply  my  signature. Unfortunately, I have  been  in the  process of  moving
this week and  I am  not able to  manually  sign  the  documents. Please  accept
these   documents  as   the   information   requested   for  my   security   clearance
application. (GE 3)
The  documents  provided  were  for  tax  years  2014  through  2018  and  stamped
across them in large bold letters was: “PREVIEW COPY-DO NOT FILE.” He testified that
the accounting firm told him the tax returns were filed in 2019. He did not provide any
documentary evidence from the tax firm or explanation for why he did not have a copy for
his records. His testimony was he believed this tax firm was going to file his returns. He
did not follow up to see if they were filed. The tax returns were not filed at that time. He
did not reach out to the firm to set up a payment plan with the IRS because he believed
their services did not include doing this. (Tr. 52-57, 102-107) I did not find his statements
credible.
On  October  17,  2019,  Applicant  sent  another  email  as  a  supplement  to  his
September 2019 Government interrogatories. This email stated that he anticipated having
“feedback today on the terms of a repayment plan for the IRS.” He further stated:
The   amounts  shown   being   owed   for the   years 2008-2018   are  due   to   not
having  the  opportunity  to  include  any  deductions for 1099  work conducted
during  those  years. These  amounts would have  been  much  less,  had  I taken
advantage of these  available deductions  for business expenses. (GE 4)
Applicant offered  no  explanation  for why  he  did not have  the  “opportunity” to  include  his
deductions,  other than  he  failed to  file the returns and the  IRS  filed  a  substitute return  for
him.
In  Applicant’s January  2020  answer  to the  SOR, he  stated  that  he never intended
to   hide   any   illegal  tax   dealings  from  the   IRS.  He   further  stated:  “I  am   completely   in
compliance  with  the  filing  of  all  tax  years at this time, and  I am  working  with  a  company
called  (XYZ).  He said XYZ is working  closely with  the  IRS  on  his behalf to  resolve  all  of
his  prior tax  obligations. He did not know  the  amount of  his federal tax  debt at that time.
He admitted  that  he  failed  to  timely  file  his state  income  tax  returns  for tax  years 2008
through  2015, and  again XYZ was working  to  resolve  them. He stated  XYZ was working
with   the   IRS   on   his  state   returns,   but  presumably   he   meant  the   specific  states’  tax
authorities. (Answer to  SOR). Applicant  did  not provide  supporting  tax  documents with
his SOR Answer to show he had  filed  his delinquent federal or state tax returns.
On June 6, 2021, Applicant provided an updated response to the SOR as part of
his evidence. (AE B) He stated:
I have  since  realized  that the  reason  for any  outstanding  debt to  the  IRS
was due  to me failing  to  apply  the  correct number of  deductions in order to
maintain a  lower tax  liability  by  the  end  of each  tax  year. After reviewing  my
tax   account  with   irs.gov,  it  was  determined   that  the   IRS   has  already
calculated  a  predetermined  amount of  liability  for the  years 2008  to  2013,
so   filing   those   tax   years  is  no   longer  applicable.   During   further  research
regarding   tax   years  2014-2018,  I   learned   that  those   documents  had   not
been  filed  as promised  by  the  company  I was working  with  at the  time. After
learning   this  disturbing   fact,  I  immediately   contacted   a   company   called
[ABC] and was able to  get all of  the tax years filed. I am happy to say that I
am  completely  in compliance  with  all  federal tax  filings at this time, including
2019 and 2020. (AE B)
In   his  updated   answer  to   the   SOR,  Applicant   did  not  provide   any   additional
evidence  regarding  the  status of his state  income  returns  or tax  debt alleged  in SOR ¶
1.c. He reiterated  the  same  information  regarding  the  debt for the  repossessed  vehicle
alleged  in SOR ¶  1.d  that he  did  in his January  2020  answer, but provided  no  evidence
of  any  action  he  has taken  to  resolve  this debt from  2014. He stated  in both  his January
2020   answer  and   June   2021   updated   answer  that  he   disputed   the   debt  in  SOR  ¶   1.f
($1,450)   owed   to   a   mobile   phone   carrier.  In   both   responses,   he   said  the   debt   was  no
longer on  his  credit  report. The  debt is reported  on  both  his  February  2020  and  June  2019
credit  reports.  Applicant  did   not  provide   any   proof  to   the   contrary.  This  debt   is  not
resolved. (Tr. 72-74; GE 6, 8; AE B)
Applicant testified that he did not timely file his 2008 through 2018 federal income
tax returns. He stated that he was aware that he would owe taxes for some of these years
due  not  having  a  sufficient  amount  withheld  from  his  pay  and  his  1099  independent
contractor income. He stated he did not have documents to show when he filed his 2008
and  2013  federal  income  tax  returns,  but he  believed  he  had.  He said he  did file  his 2014
through   2018   returns,  but  not   on   time.  When   questioned   why   he   said   in  the
abovementioned  email from October 2019 as a supplement to his interrogatories that he
did file  them,  he said that  he  had been told by his accountant that they were filed.  He did
not provide  copies  of  the  returns.  When  asked  if  he  contacted  the  tax  professionals to
retrieve   a   copy,  he   said  he   had   not.  Throughout  the   hearing   I  did   not  find   Applicant’s
testimony  credible  or believable. Based  on  the  documentary  evidence  provided  by  both
the  Government and  Applicant,  he  repeatedly  made  claims that  were not true. (Tr. 48,  65-
68)
Post-hearing,  Applicant  provided  documents  to  show  that  on  June  9,  2021,  he
mailed his 2014 through 2020 federal income tax returns to the IRS. A week before his
hearing,  Applicant  hired  a  new  tax  professional.  Based  on  the  tax  professional’s
calculations, presumably not including penalties and interest, he owes $66,009 for those
tax years. I will not consider for disqualifying purposes that Applicant filed his 2019 federal
tax return late, but may consider it as noted above.  Applicant testified that he failed to
timely file his 2019 federal income tax return because he and his wife wanted to  figure
out what the best way to file jointly. (Tr. 59-63, 69-71, 108-109; AE E through L)
In  addition,  Applicant  provided  documents  to  show his  2011 federal  income  tax
return was filed in September 2012 - balance owed is $6,771; 2012 was filed in November
2013 – balance owed is $7,747; 2013 filed in June 2015 – balance owed is $8,082. The
approximate total tax owed for these years is $22,600. He did not provide an explanation
for why he failed to pay his taxes for these years. He did not provide additional information
as  to  the  current  status  of  his  delinquent  state  income  tax  returns.  They  remain
unresolved. (AE D, M, N. O)
Applicant stated he was unable to retrieve the tax transcripts for tax years 2008
through  2010.  He  assumed  it  was  because  they  were  older  than  ten  years.  Applicant
testified that he believed he owes about $20,000 in federal income taxes for the past two
tax  years  (2019  and  2020)  in  addition  to  the  previous  amounts  discussed.  His  federal
income tax debt is likely over $100,000. When asked how he intended to pay the amount,
he stated that the tax professionals at ABC will continue to work on his behalf and with
the IRS to reach a payment agreement and get the amount he owes reduced. He hopes
to have his debt to the IRS paid within five years. He provided copies of forms increasing
his  federal  income  tax  withholding,  a  power  of  attorney  for  his  tax  representative,  tax
representative authorization, and payment receipts to his tax professional. (AE D, P, Q,
R, S)
Applicant and his wife own rental property in another state that they purchased in
2006. He estimated it is valued at approximately $340,000 and they owe about $188,000
on the mortgage. In 2011 and 2014, Applicant had debt canceled and received IRS 1099C
forms  for  approximately  $21,000  and  $39,000  respectively.  Applicant  and  his  wife
purchased  a  house  in  October  2019  and  their  monthly  mortgage  payment  is  $2,750.
Applicant testified that he has no money in his savings account and approximately $4,000
in  his  checking  account.  He  estimated  he  has  approximately  $2,500  in  expendable
income  each  month  after  paying  expense.  He  estimated  he  has  about  $10,000  in  his
401(k) retirement account. When asked how he intended to pay his tax debt, he stated
he was going to use the money in his retirement account. (Tr. 117-128; GE 4, 11)
Three character witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. He was described as
an upstanding citizen with integrity. He volunteers at his church and is a Christian family
man. He is a person that can be trusted as a friend, colleague, and employee. He is calm,
and fair. He can be trusted and is a person who can be relied upon. His witnesses believe
he should  continue to hold a security clearance, and they have never had a reason to
believe he is any kind of threat or concern to the United States. (Tr. 28-39)
