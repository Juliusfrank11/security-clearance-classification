In  Applicant’s  answer to  the  SOR, he  admitted  all  the  allegations. His  admissions
in his  answer and at the hearing  are incorporated in  my findings of  fact.
Applicant  is  a   40-year-old  subject-matter  expert  who   installs   communications
upgrades  on  ships. He  has been  employed  by  a  federal contractor since  July  2004. He
received  a  security  clearance  in  July  2007.  He served  on  active  duty  in the  U.S.  Navy
from October 1998  to  December 2000 and received an honorable discharge.
Applicant  married   in   October 2000,  separated   in  December 2013,  and   divorced
around   2018.  (Tr.  15.)   He  has  lived   with   a   cohabitant   since   March   2015.   He  has  two
children, ages 22 and  15, who live with their mother.  (GX 1  at 16, 19-20.)
The  SOR alleges  six  delinquent  debts totaling  about $26,000, including  the  $71
medical debt in  SOR ¶  1.d, which was withdrawn. The  debts are reflected  in  credit reports
from   April  2017   (GX   2),  April  2019   (GX   3),  and   April  2021   (GX   4).  The   evidence
concerning the  debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR  ¶   1.a:   car   lease   charged   off  for  $17,410.   This  debt  was  incurred   when
Applicant terminated  a  car lease  early. (Tr. 53-54.) The  April 2019  credit report reflects
that  the  account  was  opened  in  May  2014, became  delinquent  in  January  2017,  and  was
paid off in February 2020.  (GX 4  at 5.)
SOR ¶  1.b:  credit-card account  charged  off  for $9,300.  The  April 2019  credit
report reflects that  this  account became  delinquent in  May  2016, was charged  off,  and
was settled  for less  than  the  full  balance. (GX  4  at  5.)  Applicant’s bank statement  reflects
a check to  this creditor dated February 4, 2020  for $1,860. (AX A.)
SOR ¶ 1.c: delinquent medical bill for $170. Applicant testified that he could not
provide  any  information  about  this  debt.  (Tr.38.)  It  is  reflected  in  the  April  2019  credit
report.  (GX  3  at  2.)  The  credit  report  reflecting  this  debt  does  not  include  an  account
number, the name of the medical provider, the name of a collection agency, or any other
information identifying the debt. The debt is not reflected in the April 2021 credit report.
(GX 4.)
SOR ¶ 1.e: utility bill placed for collection of $36. Applicant testified that he paid
this debt. (Tr. 41.) The debt is reflected in the April 2019 credit report but not reflected in
the April 2021 credit report. (GX 3 at 2; GX 4.) Applicant continues to receive utilities from
the same provider. His most recent bill reflects that the account is current. (AX D.)
SOR ¶ 1.f: cellphone bill placed for collection of $79. Applicant testified that he
paid this debt. It is reflected in the April 2017 credit report, but it is not reflected in the
credit reports from April 2019 or April 2021. Applicant testified that he still has service with
the same provider, and his monthly statement reflects that the account is current. (AX C;
Tr. 50.)
Applicant attributed his delinquent debts to a lengthy marital breakup over a period
of about four years. He testified that he paid a divorce lawyer about $4,000 in 2015, and
the lawyer disappeared after taking his money. (Tr. 15, 32.) He and his wife owned two
homes, living in one and renting the other. When they separated, Applicant was working
overseas, and his wife moved out of the former family home. They began renting both
homes and had difficulty paying two mortgages when their tenants failed to pay their rent.
(Tr. 29-30.) Applicant was able to dispose of both properties by short sales around 2017
and avoid any delinquencies related to them. (Tr. 31.)
Applicant has not sought or received financial counseling. (Tr. 47-48.) Regarding
the debts alleged in the SOR, he testified that he “buckled down,” saved as much money
as he could, worked as many hours as possible, and was able to resolve all his delinquent
debts. (Tr. 37-38.) He testified that he is working on reducing his financial obligations and
has paid down the balance on a credit card (not alleged in the SOR) by about $6,000. (Tr.
13.)  The  April  2021  credit  report  reflects  a  credit-card  account  with  a  credit  limit  of
$22,000; a balance of $15,233; and monthly payments of $308, which are current. (GX 4
at 2.)
Applicant’s  take-home  pay  is  about  $6,000  per  month.  He  has  invested  about
$3,000 in cryptocurrency. He has an average of about $2,000 in his checking account.
He rents his home for $1,700 per month, including utilities. He owns one vehicle, a high-
performance car that he bought to indulge his hobby of competitive driving. He bought it
after resolving the debts associated with his divorce. He and his 15-year-old son spend
time together watching car races, motocross bikes, and rally cars. (Tr. 23-24.) The April
2021 credit report reflects that he borrowed $50,651 in May 2020; his monthly payments
are  $859;  the  balance  is  $44,745;  and  the  payments  are  current.  (GX  4  at  2.)  His  net
monthly  remainder  after  paying  all  financial  obligations  and  living  expenses  is  about
$1,500. (Tr. 21-25.)
