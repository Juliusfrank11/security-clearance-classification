In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted all the allegations. Her admissions
in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  41-year-old  pipefitter  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since
December 2017. She graduated from high school in June 1988  and worked in several
private-sector jobs  until she  was  hired  by her current  employer.  She  has never held  a
security clearance.
Applicant married in August 2016 and separated in February 2018. She has four
children, ages 18, 16, 12, and 8, all of whom live with her. She testified that she is entitled
to receive court-ordered child support payments of about $500 per month, but she actually
receives only about $300 per month. (Tr. 34.)
The  SOR  alleges  21  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $165,000,  including  a
judgment for a $11,101 deficiency on a repossessed automobile and a garnishment to
enforce the judgment (SOR ¶ 1.a); payments on a mortgage loan that are two months
past due for $1,607, with  a  total loan balance  of  $36,215  (SOR ¶ 1.b);  two  delinquent
student loans, one placed for collection of $45,205 (SOR ¶ 1.c) and the other past due
for $4,679, with a total balance of $66,355 (SOR ¶ 1.k); 14 delinquent medical bills for
amounts  between  $110  and  $1,210  (SOR  ¶¶  1.e-1.j,  1.l,  1.m,  1.o,  1.p,  and  1.r-1.u); a
utility  bill  placed  for  collection  of  $702  (SOR  ¶  1.n);  and  a  cellphone  bill  placed  for
collection of $533 (SOR ¶ 1.p). The delinquent debts are reflected in court records and
credit reports from August 2018 and August 2019. (GX 2-5.)
In addition to the debts alleged in the SOR, the credit reports from August 2018
and  August  2019  reflect  four  delinquent  medical  debts  totaling  about  $300,  and  court
records reflect a judgment for about $10,000, entered on January 15, 2020, for furniture
purchased under a rent-to-own contract two or three years ago. (GX 4; GX 5; GX 8; Tr.
26.)
Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in April 2019 and confronted
with several of her delinquent debts. She attributed many of the medical debts to care
she received at a time that she did not have medical insurance. She admitted that the
debts  were  unresolved,  and  she  promised  to  contact  the  creditors  and  collection
companies and make payment arrangements. (GX 6.)
Applicant  filed  a  petition  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  on  January  13,  2020.  The
petition specifically listed the creditors alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a 1.b, 1.k, and 1.q, as well as
numerous medical providers or their collection agents. Her payment plan was approved
in March 2020 and provided for payments of $457 for 6 months, then $844 for 41 months,
and  then  $895  for  13  months.  If  she  completes  the  plan,  she  will  have  paid  a  total  of
$49,981.  (GX  7  at  61.)  The  plan  includes  past-due  payments  on  Applicant’s  home
mortgage, but requires her to continue making the monthly mortgage payments. Applicant
has been making the required payments to the bankruptcy trustee by garnishment of her
pay  since  February  2020.  (AX  D.)  When  Applicant  failed  to  make  the  mortgage  loan
payment for December 2020, the mortgage lender filed a notice of default and requested
relief from the automatic stay of foreclosure. (GX 7 at 75-76.)
Applicant testified that her bankruptcy payment plan includes a $10,000 judgment
entered on January 15, 2015, for furniture purchased under a rent-to-own contract. (Tr.
26; GX 8.) However, the furniture vendor was not specifically listed among the creditors
to be paid under her payment plan.
Applicant  testified  that  the  repossession  deficiency  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  was
incurred after she co-signed a loan for a “close friend,” but they broke up, her friend took
the  vehicle,  and  he  stopped  making  payments.  Applicant  was  unable  to  make  the
payments, resulting in the repossession. (Tr. 14-15, 22-23.)
Applicant  testified  that  she  had  contacted  her  home-mortgage  lender  and  was
attempting  to  modify  her  payment  plan  to  include  the  judgment  for  furniture  and  the
monthly mortgage payments, but the modification had not been completed as of the date
of the hearing. (Tr. 24-26, 32.)
Applicant testified that she incurred numerous medical debts because she suffered
from an autoimmune disorder that required frequent medical intervention, and the full cost
of treatment was not covered by insurance. She was not aware that her medical bills had
been referred for collection until around November 2019, when she obtained  copies of
her credit reports in order to prepare her bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 17-19.)
Applicant testified that she attended college, seeking to obtain a bachelor’s degree
in  homeland  security.  The  record  does  not  reflect  when  or  for  how  long  she  attended
college. She dropped out because she was unable to handle working full time, taking care
of her four children, and attending classes. When she dropped out, she was required to
start making payments on her student loans, which amounted to about $300 per month.
She applied for and obtained several hardship deferments.
The credit report from August 2018 reflects a student loan that was more than 120
days past due for $4,679, with a balance of $66,355. (GX 4 at 3.) This debt is alleged in
SOR ¶ 1.k. The credit report from August 2019 reflects a student loan assigned to the
government for collection of $45,205. This debt is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. Applicant testified
that she notified the student loan servicer that she had filed a bankruptcy petition and was
telephonically informed that no payments would be due on the student loans for five years,
which  is  the  length  of  the  payment  plan  for  her  bankruptcy.  (Tr.  20-21.)  Applicant’s
bankruptcy petition lists a debt to the Department of Education for $84,610. (GX 7 at 32
and 34.) She submitted copies of entries on a May 2021 credit report reflecting that the
two student loans were included in her bankruptcy petition and were closed. (AX A and
B.)  She  did  not  submit  any  information  regarding  the  applicability  of  the  COVID-19
deferment to her student loans.
Applicant earns $23.31  an hour and normally  works  a 40-hour week.  Her gross
income for 2019 was $46,853. (GX 7 at 42.) However, she was unable to work from March
3 to July 27, 2020, because of her autoimmune problems and COVID-19 work restrictions,
and  she  earned  only  about  $26,000  for  2020.  (Tr.  27-28.)  Her  bankruptcy  petition
reflected that she had about $5,583 in her 401(k) retirement account. (GX 7 at 20.) She
testified that  she  borrowed  money from  her 401(k) account and  payments on  the  loan
were being deducted from her paycheck. (Tr. 29.) Her bankruptcy petition reflects child-
support arrearages totaling about $18,996. (GX 7 at 17.)
The debts listed in Applicant’s bankruptcy petition are not the result of extravagant
spending.  She  lives  modestly  in  a  home  described  in  the  bankruptcy  petition  as  a
manufactured or mobile home, on which the monthly payments are $793. She drives a
13-year-old economy car, on which the monthly payments are $387. (GX 7 at 13, 64.)
