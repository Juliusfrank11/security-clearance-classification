Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations, with explanations. His admissions are
incorporated  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review of  the  pleadings  and  evidence,  I  make
the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  28-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  has  worked  for
this employer  since  December 2016.  He experienced  a period  of unemployment  while
he attended college through September 2013. He is single, never married, and has no
children. He has cohabitated with his girlfriend since 2015. (Tr. at 6, 36; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  accumulated  ten  delinquent  (four  student  loans
($27,159) and six medical ($5,183)) debts totaling approximately $32,342 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-
1.j). The allegations are supported by his disclosures to his trustworthiness application
(SCA) in  December 2016,  statements  to a defense  investigator during his background
investigation in January and February 2018, credit reports from March 2017, May 2019,
March  2020,  and  April  2021,  and  admissions  in  his  SOR  answer.  (GE  1-6;  SOR
Answer)
Applicant attributed his delinquent debts to having to leave college because of a
lack of funding in April 2013. He had a semester left but could not afford to continue. He
financed  his  schooling,  up  to  that  point,  using  student  loans.  He  experienced  some
health  issues  in  approximately  2013,  which  required  hospitalization.  In  2015,  his
girlfriend, with whom he was living, was involved in a serious auto accident. The brunt of
paying  the  couple’s  bills  fell  on  Applicant.  His  student  loans  became  delinquent  in
approximately September 2013. Applicant asserted that his wages have been garnished
in the past to pay his student loans and that either his 2019 or 2020 federal income tax
refund  was  captured  by  the  IRS  to  apply  towards  his  student  loans.  He  failed  to
document  either  of  these  occurrences.  He  documented  making  a  single  $96  payment
toward his student loans in April 2019. He also documented applying for consideration
under  a  student
loan
rehabilitation  when  he  determined  that  the  calculated  payments  under  the  program
would be too much. He has made no further payments or established a payment plan
towards his delinquent student loans and believes the current balance is approximately
$30,000. He made a conscious choice to pay other bills before addressing his student
loans.  These  debts  remain  unresolved.  (Tr.  at  24-30,  37-38;  GE  3-5;  SOR  Answer

loan  rehabilitation  program.  He  discontinued  pursuing
Applicant claimed that he made payments toward his medical debts, but he failed
to produce supporting documentation. His records show that he made several payments
to  his  girlfriend  in  March  2021,  but  these  payments  cannot  be  correlated  to  any  SOR
debt. The medical debts are unresolved. (Tr. at 31; GE 3-5)
Applicant  documented  payments  toward  several  non-SOR  debts,  including
paying credit cards, consumer debt, and his car loan. He did not provide any budget or
financial counseling information. (Tr. at 39; AE A-G)
