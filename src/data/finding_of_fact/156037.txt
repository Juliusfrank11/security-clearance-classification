Applicant  is  a  41-year-old  ship  fitter  for  a  defense  contractor  who  seeks
continuation  of  his  security  clearance.  The  admitted  allegations  are  incorporated  and
adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant  married  in  July  1994  and  divorced  in  April  1997.  (Item  3)  He  has  no
children from this marriage. He remarried in August 1998 and divorced in January 2014.
(Items 2-3) He has two children (ages 22 and 20) from this marriage. (Items 2-3 and 7)
He  remarried  again  in  August  2018  and  has  three  stepchildren  from  his  most  recent
marriage.  (Items  2-3)  Applicant  earned  an  associate’s  degree  in  December  2006.  He
attended vocational classes  between May 2005 and December 2005, but did not obtain
a degree or diploma. (Items 2-3) Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army in  April 1994 and
served five years of active duty. (Items 2-3) He received an honorable discharge in April
1999.
Since  January  2015,  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  his  current  employer.
(Items  2-3)  Between  September  2011  and  January  2015,  he  worked  for  other  non-
defense  employers  in  various  types  of  jobs  and  disciplines.  Between  December  2005
and September 2011, he was a self-employed handyman. (Items 2-3)
Applicant’s   finances
Between   December  2010   and   October  2016,  Applicant  accumulated   35
delinquent   debts   exceeding   $26,000.  (Items  3-5)  Several  of  the   debts  represent
delinquent  student loans. (SORs  ¶¶  1.a-1.b) Others represent delinquent medical debts
(SOR  ¶¶   1.f-1.h   and   1.j-1.ii)   The   remaining   three   listed   debts  represent   delinquent
consumer debts. (SORs ¶¶  1.c-1.e,1.i), and  1.ii)
Applicant’s  documented  efforts  to  address  the  debts  covered  by  the  SOR  are
limited  to  two  small  payments  of  $75  and  $176,  respectively,  to  the  medical  creditor
covered  by  SOR ¶¶1f-1.h  and  1.j-1.gg). (Item  10)  Applicant’s claims   of  making  efforts to
address  his  other  delinquent  accounts  are  not  supported   by   any   corroborating
documentation. The  only  other cited  debt that he  is addressing  is a  non-SOR car loan
for $9,681, which currently carries a reported  reduced balance of $3,867.  (Item 9)
Applicant attributed his debt delinquencies in part to the burdens associated with
fulfilling his child support obligations to his second wife and their two children imposed
by the terms of his divorce decree. (Items 6-7)  Under the terms of his divorce decree,
Applicant  became  responsible  for  child  support  obligations  in  the  monthly  amount  of
$668 for the support of his two minor children (one of whom is now an adult), beginning
January 2014. (Items 6-7)
By  all  reported  accounts,  Applicant  has  been  compliant  with  his  child  support
terms.  (Items  6-7).  Applicant’s  divorce  decree  also  obligated  him  to  make  monthly
spousal support payments of $1,000, beginning in January 2014. (Items 6-7) Applicant’s
credit  reports  do  not  reveal  any  delinquencies  in  his  child  and  spousal  support
obligations.
Absent  documentation   from   Applicant’s  committing    more  of    his    resources  to
addressing   his  delinquent   accounts   covered   by   SOR  ¶¶   1.a-1.ii   with   pay-offs  and
payment   plans,  resolution    of    Applicant’s  SOR-listed   accounts  cannot  be   favorably
established.
Applicant  is  highly  regarded  by  his  former  military  instructor,  friends,  and
coworkers  who  have  worked  with  him  and  know  him  to  be  dedicated,  accountable,
reliable, and trustworthy. (Item 11) Whether any of his character references are aware
of his past financial difficulties is unclear.
