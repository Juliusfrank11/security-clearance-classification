Financial Considerations
Applicant’s  seven  delinquent SOR debts  totaling  $26,652  are established  by  her
January 2, 2019 credit report;  her June 23, 2020 credit report;  her March 26, 2021 credit
report;   her  January   15,  2019   Office   of   Personnel  Management  Personal  Subject

Items 2, 4-7)
Applicant  attributed  her  financial  problems  to  her  former  husband  failing  to
support  the family  after  their  separation  in  2014,  and  leaving  her with  the  marital  debt
and  responsibilities  to  care  for  their  child.  (Item  4)  During  her  January  15,  2019  OPM
PSI, she claimed that she started making payments on some accounts. However, it was

of  those  accounts.  (Items  4,  8)  The  following  is  a  summary  of  Applicant’s  seven  SOR
