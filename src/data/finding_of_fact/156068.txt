Applicant  is  55   years  old.   He  married   his  ex-wife   in   1994,  they   separated   in
approximately  2014, and  divorced  in 2019. They  have  two  adult children. He received  a
Bachelor of  Science  degree  in chemical engineering  in 1993. He  has attended  some  post-
graduate  courses  but has not  obtained  a master’s degree. He  has worked  for defense
contractors since  1994,  and  has worked  for his employer  since  2006, where  he  is currently
a  mechanical engineer. He also volunteers as an  advisor at a  local university for fourth-
year chemical engineering  students.  Applicant’s first security   clearance   was granted   in
1993,  it  was  renewed   in  2002,  and   revoked   in  2014   due   to   financial  issues   related   to
investments. (GE 1; GE  2; AE I; Tr. 12-14, 20, 83, 96)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  failed  to  file  his  state  and  federal  income  tax
returns and pay his state and federal income taxes in a timely manner for tax years 2011
through 2015, and 2017, as required. In 2016, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a
tax  lien  against  him  for  $67,521.  Additionally,  he  disclosed  in  his  response  to
interrogatories that he owed approximately $1,005 to State A and $12,467 to the IRS for
tax year 2014.  Finally,  the SOR  alleged  Applicant  has five  delinquent  consumer debts
totaling $49,369. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations.
In his November 2016 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed
that he failed to file his state and federal income tax returns for tax year 2014. He did not
include that he failed to file tax returns for 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2015 as well, but he
estimated that he owed approximately $30,000 in total tax debt. (GE 1)
During his August 2018 personal subject interview, Applicant told the background
investigator  that  he  the  failed  to  file  his  2013  and  2014  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns  in  a  timely  manner,  but  planned  to  file  both  tax  returns  soon.  At  that  time,  he
claimed he had filed tax returns for 2015 and 2016. He also stated that he had filed an
extension for tax year 2017, but intended to file his returns before the extension expired.
At the hearing, Applicant admitted that he had not yet filed his 2011 to 2015 state and
federal income tax returns, this is discussed in depth below. (GE 2 at 13; Tr. 81)
According to Applicant, he suffered financial issues, and he did not file his state
and federal  income  tax returns  for tax years  2011  through  2015,  and  2017  in a  timely
manner, because:
  Applicant  was  significantly  injured  in  2007  or  2008,  while  playing  a  basketball
game, which resulted in him being unable to work. For approximately one year, he
received disability pay, which was 70% of his normal pay. As a result of the injuries,
he  did  not  have  the  energy  to  file  his  tax  returns.  He  was  the  family  member
responsible  for  filing  the  tax  returns.  He  has  never  used  a  professional  tax
preparer. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 38-40, 70-71, 81, 83)
   Applicant  and  his  wife  experienced  marital  issues  after  he  was  injured  in
2007/2008.  They  separated  in  approximately  2014,  and  divorced  in  2019.  He
supported two households and paid child support. Due to their marital issues, they
could not agree to file or pay their taxes. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 42-43, 71, 85)
   Per their divorce agreement, Applicant is responsible for their federal and state tax
debt and consumer debt. (Tr. 71-72)
   Applicant and his wife started a shutter business prior to his 2007 or 2008 injury.
This  business  failed,  and  they  owed  an  unrecalled  amount  in  credit  card  debt.
According  to  Applicant,  the  failed  business  also  contributed  to  the  delinquent
consumer debts alleged in the SOR. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 44, Tr. 72-74)
   Applicant’s  wife   was  unemployed   from   approximately   2011   until  2014.   Prior  to
losing  her job, she  earned  between  $50,000  and  $60,000  annually.  At that time,
Applicant earned between  $100,000  and  $130,000 annually.  (GE  1;  GE 2;  Tr.  37-
38)
   Applicant’s mother had acute medical issues, and he was her primary caregiver
until she passed away in July 2019. (GE 1; GE 2; AE I; Tr. 44)
  Applicant moved into his mother’s house in 2014 due to his marital issues and to
help  care  for  her.  During  the  move,  he  put  his  personal  belongings  in  storage,
including his tax documentation. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 85)
   Applicant owned a primary residence and a rental property and lost both of them
through foreclosure. He lost the rental property due to the economic downturn in
around 2008 when his renter failed to pay the monthly rent. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 74)
Applicant admitted at the hearing that as of the hearing date, he had not filed his
federal  and  State  A  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2011  through  2015.  Additionally,
although the failure to file his tax returns for tax year 2019 was not alleged in the SOR,
he also admitted that he had not filed his 2019 federal or state income tax return after the
extension expired in October 2020. As noted in the chart below, Applicant claimed in his
post-hearing submissions that he filed his 2011 through 2015 federal and state income
tax  returns  on  May  17,  2021.  He  did  not  provide  copies  of  the  returns,  proof  that  the
returns were filed, or proof that the returns were accepted by either the IRS or State A.
(GE 1; AE E; AE F; AE G; Tr. 84-86, 89-90)
Although Applicant asserted that he is entitled to significant refunds, from both the
IRS and State A, he provided no documentation to support these claims. Additionally, the
documentation  provided  by  Government  counsel  indicates  that  even  if  Applicant  were
entitled to a refund for one or more tax years, he would be precluded from receiving a
refund for tax years 2011 through 2015, due to the IRS’s three-year and State A’s four-
year statute of limitations (SOL). The SOLs indicate that taxpayers must file a claim for
refund  after  the  original  return  due  date  within  a  specified  time  period  to  receive  the
refund. Finally, the balances provided by Applicant, below, do not reflect any potentially
applicable penalties or interest owed to the IRS and/or State A. (GE 10; GE 11; GE 12;

Applicant  believes he  is entitled  to  an  overall  refund  from  the  IRS, due  to  mortgage
interest  deductions for his foreclosed  properties, as noted  above. According  to  Applicant,
he   filed   for  an   extension   each   tax   year,  extending   the   deadline   to   October   for  each
respective  tax  year, but he  did not provide  documentation  to  support these  claims.  He
admitted   that   he   failed   to   file   returns  for  tax   years  2011   through   2018   before   the
extensions expired, and  his return for tax  year  2019  remains unfiled. (AE  B; AE  C; Tr. 33-
34, 52-53)
Applicant  sent  letters  to  the  IRS  and  State  A  in  October  2018.  He  provided  no
documentation from the IRS or State A that they received or responded to either letter.
Applicant  testified  that he  would  periodically receive  notices from  the  IRS and State  A
indicating which tax years were still delinquent, additionally, he would occasionally speak
to them telephonically. At the hearing, Applicant testified that both the IRS and State A
are waiting for Applicant and his wife to submit a formal proposal to repay their delinquent
taxes. (GE B; GE C; Tr. 24, 26, 51-57)
After the hearing, Applicant provided the first page of a letter the IRS sent him on
September 20, 2020, regarding tax years 2011 through 2018. This letter indicated that
the IRS could not consider Applicant’s March 20, 2020 installment agreement request:
We   can’t  consider  your  installment  agreement  request  without  reviewing
your  financial  information.  Complete   and   return  Form   433-F,  Collection
Information   Statement   or  Form   433-B,  Collection   Information   Statement
for Businesses, within 30 days from this letter. (AE H)
As of May 2021, Applicant had not yet completed the IRS’ Form 433-F to enter into
an installment agreement with the IRS.
Applicant testified that the IRS started garnishing his wages in 2019, and the 2016
$67,521 tax lien alleged in SOR 1.c was reduced to $12,467 as of the hearing date, but
he failed to provide documentary proof to substantiate his claims. (GE 4; GE 6 at 3; Tr.
81)
The  five  consumer  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.f  through  1.j  became  delinquent
between  2009  and  2014.  Although,  only  SOR  ¶  1.j  appears  on  his  most  recent  credit
bureau  report,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  has  not  paid  or  resolved  any  of  the  alleged
consumer  debts.  Nor  has  he  made  any  recent  attempts  to  contact  the  creditors  and
establish payments plans. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 5 at 3, 8; GE 6 at 3; GE 7 at 4; Tr. 61-64)
In 2011, Applicant’s facility security officer (FSO) reported in the Joint Personnel
Adjudication System (JPAS) that there was a $37,000 court-ordered garnishment against
Applicant’s wages. This issue was not alleged in the SOR, but Applicant told his FSO that
he believed it was credit-card related. At the hearing, he testified that he  was unsure if
this was for an IRS debt or credit-card related. Applicant testified that starting in  2019,
State A had garnished his wages $400 each month for $49,329 of taxes. This obligation
was not alleged in the SOR, nor did he provide supporting documentary proof of the tax
obligation or garnishment. (GE 3; Tr. 75-79)
Applicant has never used a tax professional, he has always prepared his own tax
returns along with his wife. He has never received financial counseling. He currently has
approximately $120,000 to $140,000 in his retirement savings account, and his annual
salary is over $164,000. (AE I; Tr. 41-42, 51, 82-84)
In April 2021, Applicant received a $21,846 settlement check related to his father’s
asbestos exposure. According to Applicant, he anticipates that he will receive additional
settlement funds, and he intends to use his portion of the settlement to pay his tax debts
and other delinquent obligations. (AE D; AE I; Tr. 34, 93)
