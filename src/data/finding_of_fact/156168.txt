Applicant admitted  nine  of  the  SOR allegations  (SOR ¶¶  1.b-1.f,  1.h-1.i, and  1.k-
1.l),  with   explanations,  and   denied   three   allegations   (SOR  ¶¶   1.a,  1.g,  and   1.j).   The
admissions are adopted  as  findings of  fact.  After a  careful review  of the  pleadings and
evidence, I make the  following  additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 28 years old. He has worked for a federal contractor since April 2018.
He has had periods of unemployment from June 2017 to January 2018; October 2012 to
April 2013; and October 2011 to April 2012. He received his high school diploma in 2011.
He  is  single,  never  married  and  has  no  children.  He  cares  for  and  provides  financial
support to his mother. (Item 3)
The SOR alleged 12 delinquent debts totaling approximately $41,479. The debts
are  comprised  of  collections  accounts  and  charged-off  accounts  (auto  repossession,
credit  card,  consumer  debt,  and  medical  debts).  The  debts  are  established  by  credit
reports from January 2021 (incorrectly dated in the FORM as January 15, 2020), October
2019, and July 2018, and his SOR admissions. (Items 2, 4-6)
Applicant attributes his financial problems to bearing the financial responsibility for
supporting his infirm mother and before he passed away, his stepfather. He also had his
own medical conditions, which were not fully covered by his medical plan, and periods of
unemployment.  He  disputed  information  on  the  credit  reports  without  providing
documentation  supporting  the  disputes.  He  also  pointed  out  that  he  has  paid  several
accounts not listed on the various credit reports. He also described some of the various
charitable and civic organizations he has worked with in the past. (Item 2; AE A)
The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
SOR ¶  1.a-$10,290  charge  off.  This is an  auto  repossession  account opened  in
June   2014.  Applicant   admitted   having   an   auto   voluntarily   repossessed   in   2014,   but
claimed  that  he  did not have  any  knowledge  of this creditor. He  claimed  his dealings were
with  the  creditor listed  in SOR ¶  1.d. He  did not provide  any  documentation  supporting
his dispute  or documents that show  this account  is a  duplicate  of the  debt  listed  in  SOR
¶ 1.d. This debt is unresolved. (Items 2, 4-6; AE A)
SOR ¶  1.b-$6,791  charge  off.  This is an  account with  a  financial institution  opened
in August 2014, which went delinquent in  2015. Applicant admitted  this account and  has
expressed   his  intent   not  to   pay   the   account,   but  let  it   “fall   off   my   credit.”  This   debt   is
unresolved.  (Items  2, 4-6; AE  A)
(SOR  ¶   1.c)-$6,811   charge   off.   This  is  an  account  with  a  financial  institution
opened in October 2013, which went delinquent in 2015. Applicant admitted this account
and has expressed his intent not to pay the account, but let it “fall off my credit.” This debt
is unresolved. (Items 2, 4-6; AE A)
(SOR ¶  1.d)-$6,034  collection.  Applicant claims this debt is a duplicate of SOR
debt ¶ 1.a. He failed to supply documentation supporting his assertion. It was assigned
to  this  creditor  in  March  2015.  It  reflects  a  first  delinquency  of  July  2014  and  remains
unpaid. This debt is unresolved. (Items 2, 4-6; AE A)
(SOR  ¶   1.e)-$5,479   charge   off.   This  is  an  account  with  a  financial  institution
opened in April 2014, which went delinquent in 2015. Applicant admitted this account and
has expressed his intent not to pay the account, but let it “fall off my credit.” This debt is
unresolved. (Items 2, 4-6; AE A)
(SOR ¶  1.f)-$1,355  collection.  This is a credit-card account assigned in January
2015,  which  first  went  delinquent  in  2014.  Applicant  admitted  this  account  and  has
expressed  his  intent  not  to  pay  the  account,  but  let  it  “fall  off  my  credit.”  This  debt  is
unresolved. (Items 2, 4-6; AE A)
(SOR  ¶   1.g)-$1,120   collection.   This  is  a  medical  debt  assigned  in  September
2017, which went delinquent in June 2017. Applicant claimed he was disputing this debt
based  upon  an  alleged  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  (HIPAA)
violation.  He  failed  to  produce  documentation  to  support  his  dispute.  This  debt  is
unresolved. (Note: The payment of $1,120 reflected in AE A, may be toward this debt,
however, Applicant fails to identify it as such and no other evidence in the record connects
the SOR debt with this payment. Even if I considered the payment identified in AE A as
paying this debt and finding for Applicant on this allegation, it would not change the overall
result). (Items 2, 4-6; AE A)
(SOR  ¶   1.h)-$1,097   charge   off.   This  is  an  account  with  a  financial  institution
(credit  card)  opened  in  February  2014,  which  went  delinquent  in  September  2014.
Applicant admitted this account and has expressed his intent not to pay the account, but
let it “fall off my credit.” This debt is unresolved. (Items 2, 4-6; AE A)
(SOR  ¶   1.i)-$564   collection.   This  is  a  utilities  debt  assigned  in  June  2019.  It
reflects a first delinquency of July 2017. Applicant provided documentation showing that
a successor creditor was paid in April 2021. This debt is resolved. (Items 2, 4-6; AE A)
(SOR ¶  1.j)-$435  collection.  This is a medical debt assigned in November 2020.
It reflects a first delinquency of  June 2015. Applicant provided documentation showing
that a successor creditor was paid in April 2021. This debt is resolved. (Items 2, 4-6; AE
A)
(SOR  ¶   1.k)-$225   collection.   This  is  a  consumer  debt  assigned  in  September
2014. It reflects a balance date of July 2017. Applicant provided documentation showing
that the debt was settled in April 2021. This debt is resolved. (Items 2, 4-6; AE A)
(SOR ¶  1.l)-$1,099  charge  off.  This is an account with a financial institution (credit
card) assigned in April 2014, with a balance date of June 2018. Applicant admitted this
account and has expressed his intent not to pay the account, but let it “fall off my credit.”
This debt is unresolved. (Items 2, 6; AE A)
(Non-SOR  debt)-$1,120   payment.   Applicant  presented  documentation  that  in
April 2021, he made a payment to a collection company in the stated amount. He does
not relate this payment to any SOR debt. This payment is noted (See SOR ¶ 1.g above).
(AE A)
Other than stated above, Applicant did not provide any documentation showing his
current financial status or any consultations with financial counselors. He provided screen
shots  that  several  collection  accounts  were  removed  from  his  credit  report.  That
documentation did not state which accounts were removed or why they were removed.
(AE A).
