Applicant, 55, has worked for her employer, a federal contracting company, since
April  2018.  She  was  previously  granted  access
in
approximately  1991,  but  it  is  unclear  if  she  has  held  a  clearance  continuously  since
then. Applicant completed her most recent security clearance application in June 2017
and did not disclose any derogatory information. A July 2017 credit report showed only
one  delinquent  debt  for  a  time-share  property.  The  other  accounts  reported  were  in
good  standing.  A  later  credit  report,  dated  August  2019,  showed  that  Applicant  owed
$49,875 on five delinquent accounts, which are alleged in the SOR. (GE 3, GE 5 - 6)

At  the  time  Applicant  completed  the  June  2017  security  clearance  application,
she  was  employed  by  another  federal  contracting  company  where  she  worked  for  the
previous two  years. In November 2017, she learned that her employer did not win  the
bid  to  renew  the  contract  on  which  she  had  been  working.  Concerned  about  the
potential  loss  of  employment,  Applicant  began  looking  for  ways  to  reduce  her  high-
interest-rate consumer-credit accounts. At the time, all of her consumer-credit accounts
and her mortgage were current. She did not have a history of delinquent debt. Although
she described her finances as stable, she began talking to a law firm that specialized in
debt-repayment assistance. (GE 2-3; AE A)
Applicant  was  laid  off  on  February  28,  2018.  The  next  day,  she  retained  a  law
firm  to  help  her  negotiate  payment  plans  on  six  accounts,  including  those  alleged  in
SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d. Under the terms of the 36-month agreement with the law firm,
Applicant agreed to make monthly payments of $329 to the law firm, which then agreed
to  disburse  the  funds  to  the  creditors,  less  its  retainer.  Because  the  accounts  were  in
good  standing  when  Applicant  enrolled  in  the  program,  the  law  firm  advised  her  to
strategically  default  on  the  accounts  to  improve  the  law  firm’s  negotiating  position.
Applicant  has  acted  in  compliance  with  the  terms  of  this  agreement,  paying  over
$13,000 to the law firm between March 2018 and February 2021  toward the resolution
of the accounts in the repayment plan and in fees to the law firm. (GE 2, 5; AE A)
To date, the law firm has helped Applicant achieve favorable results on the debts
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a –  1.d. The creditor holding the accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a
($5,964) and 1.b ($4,769) filed a civil action against Applicant to obtain a judgment on
both  accounts.  The  law  firm  entered  consent  judgments  on  Applicant’s  behalf  in
December 2018 and in May 2019 for SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, respectively. Under the terms
of each order, Applicant has agreed to make monthly payments on each account over
the  next  four  years.  She  has  complied,  paying  $4,703  on  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  $2,268  on
SOR ¶ 1.b. The terms of the consent order are set to continue after Applicant’s contract
with the law firm ended in March 2021. Beginning in April 2021, Applicant will make the
monthly  payments  directly  to  the  creditor.  She  resolved  SOR  ¶1.c  ($2,368)  in  August
2020, as she promised in her answer to the SOR. She also included in her SOR answer
the payment receipt for SOR ¶ 1.d ($588).  (GE 2; AE A, C, E -F)
The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  ($36,204)  is for a  time-share  property Applicant
owed jointly with her husband, who was the primary debtor. The couple purchased the
property in 2014. Believing that the creditor engaged in fraudulent practices to originate
the loan, the couple refused to continue making payments on the obligation in January
2015. The creditor cancelled the debt and issued an IRS Form 1099-C for the 2015 tax
year. (GE 2; AE G)
Applicant  describes  her  current  finances  as  steady.  She  reports  that  all  of  her
consumer-credit accounts and her mortgage are in good standing. She has not opened
any  new  consumer-credit  accounts.  The  credit  reports  in  the  record  show  that  until
March 2018, she had a long and favorable credit history. (GE 5 – 6; AE A, D)
