Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.k. She denied SOR ¶¶ 1.l.through 1.n.
Her  admissions  are  incorporated  in  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is  separated  from  her spouse  and  has a  son  eight years  old who  lives
with  Applicant. She  attended  college  from  2010  to  2014  but was not awarded  a  degree.
Since  September 2018, Applicant  has worked  for a  defense  contractor. Item  3.  Applicant
has student  loan  delinquencies  totaling  just  over $32,000.  She  was on  a  monthly  payment
plan   of  $489.  Separation   from   her  husband   in   March  2017   made   her  a   single-income
parent.  Applicant could not keep up with those payments.  She has applied  to reduce  her
monthly  payment to  $175. Applicant has not,  however, provided  any  documents showing
that  this  has  been   accomplished.   Applicant  has  three   delinquent  medical  accounts
totaling  $$4,488. She  thought  those  were for herself  or her son  but  could not  recall  any
details.  Item  4.  All  debts alleged  in  the  SOR are  supported  by  the  record. Items 5  through
7. Applicant provided  no  documents concerning  her  current financial situation, such  as
her  assets, or monthly income and  expenses.
