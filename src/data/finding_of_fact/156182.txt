Applicant admitted all the allegations in SOR, except for ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.q, and 1.r.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  45-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  She  has  held  a
security clearance since 2006. She is unmarried, and has no children. Applicant has a
Master’s in Business Administration. (TR at page 15 line 1 to page 17 line 12.)
She attributes her financial difficulties to “a [legal] dispute with . . . [a] contractor”
over  a  remodel  of  a  house  Applicant  purchased  in  2012.  (TR  at  page  18  lines  1~17.)
Applicant testified as follows: “during this, paying the lawyer was very expensive. And I
didn’t know what to do. So, I kind of did one of the worst things possible was to try and
gamble  my way to  get  money for that.” (TR at page  18  lines 13~17.) Prior to  this legal
dispute, Applicant admits to gambling  about “every other month.” (TR at page  19  lines
9~17.)  After  the  legal  dispute  her  gambling  increased  to  “every  other  week  .  .  .  [her]
paycheck . . . about $2,200.” (TR at page 19 line 25 to page 20 line 8.) Applicant “hit the
rock  bottom”  and  decided  to  file  for  the  Bankruptcy  (discussed  below).  This  gambling
pattern continued for “about a  year,” about five  years prior to  her hearing. (TR at  page
21 lines 2~7.) Applicant still gambles between  $1,000~$1,500, “every few months,” the
last time being in December of 2020, four months after the issuance of the SOR. (TR at
page 21 line 14 to page 22 line 5.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a. and 1.b.  Applicant  filed   for   the   protection   of  a   Chapter  13   Bankruptcy   in
February  of  2016.  She   avers  that she  could  not keep  up  with  the  monthly  $1,900  plan
payments;  and   as   such,  “instead   of  gambling,   I  did   another  bad   thing,  which  was
Payday   Loans.”  (TR  at  page   26   lines  18~23.)  This  first  bankruptcy   was  dismissed   in
September of 2018  for failure to make  the  plan payments.
Applicant  next  withdrew

consequences,  which   led   to   her  second   Chapter  13   Bankruptcy   filing   in  October  of
2018.   In   October  of   1919,  that  petition   was   also  dismissed   for  failure  to   make   plan
payments.  (TR  at  page   27   line   1   to   page   28   line   21.)  These   allegations  are  found
against  Applicant.
from   her  “401K”;  not   realizing
funds
the
1.c.  Applicant admits  that she  is  indebted  to  the  Federal government,  as  a  result
of  401K  withdraws, in the  amount of  about $12,995. After her hearing, Applicant set up
a   payment   plan   with   the   IRS,   by   which  she   will  make   monthly   payments  of   $300
towards  this tax   debt.  (TR at   page   28   line   21   to   page   33   line   2.)  This   is evidenced  by
documentation. (AppX  A.) As a  result of this good-faith  effort, this allegation  is found  for
Applicant.
1.d.  Applicant  admits that she  was indebted  to  the  state  government,  as a  result
of  401K  withdraws, in the  amount of  about $9,030. After her hearing, Applicant set  up  a
payment   plan,  by   which   she   makes  monthly   payments  of   $400   towards  this  tax   debt.
(TR  at  page   28   line   21   to   page   33   line   2.)  Her  state   tax   debt  has  been   reduced   to
$6,949. This is evidence  by  documentation. (AppXs B  and  C.) As a  result of this good-
faith  effort, this allegation is found  for Applicant.
1.e.  Applicant  denies  that  she  has a  past-due  debt  as  the  result  of an  automobile
loan   in  the  amount  of about  $3,900. She  avers  that this debt  is  “paid  that  off  fully   .  .  .
and  . .  .  [that she]  gifted  that car to  .  . . [her] nephew.” (TR at  page  33  line  3  to  page  34
line   24.)  This  averment  is  supported   by   documentation   from   “CARFAX”;  and   as   such,
this allegation is found  for Applicant.  (AppX D.)
1.f.  Applicant  denies  that  she   has  a   past-due   mortgage   debt  in  the   amount  of
about $15,610. She  avers that this debt  “will be  caught up  . .  .  by  the  end of  March.” (TR
at  page   35   line   1  to  page   36   line   15.) This averment  is supported   by   an   April 1, 2021
credit  report  (CR)   showing   the   mortgage   debt  is  “in   good   standing”;  and   as  such,  this
allegation is found  for Applicant.  (AppX F at page 34.)
1.g. Applicant admits that she  was indebted  to  Creditor G for a  past-due  debt in
the  amount of  about $5,785. This debt is included  in  a  debt-consolidation  plan  by  which
Applicant makes monthly  payments  of $779.08.  (TR  at  page  36  line  16  to  page  40  line
4,  and   AppX   E.)  The   current  past-due   amount  is  $4,000.  (AppX   E   at  page   3.)  This
allegation is found  for Applicant.
1.h.   Applicant   admits   that  she   was  indebted  to   Creditor H for a   past-due   credit-
card  debt   in   the   amount  of  about  $1,000.  Applicant   avers  that  she   is  current  with   this
creditor,  which  averment  is  supported   by   her  April  1,  2021   CR.  (TR  at  page   40   lines
5~15, and AppX  F at pages 16~17.) This allegation is found  for Applicant.
1.i. Applicant  admits  that she  is indebted  for interest  on  a  past-due  Payday  Loan
in  the   amount  of  about  $13,810.   This  debt  is   not  included   in   Applicant’s   debt
consolidation   plan,   despite   her   averments  to   the   contrary.  (TR  at   page   40   line   17   to
page   41   line   44,  at  page   52   lines  10~13,  and   AppX   E   at  page   3.)  This  allegation   is
found against Applicant.
1.j.  Applicant  admits  that  she   was  indebted   to   Creditor  J  for  a   past-due   debt  in
the  amount  of about $1,058.  This debt is  included  in  a  debt  consolidation  plan  by  which
Applicant makes monthly  payments of  $779.08. (TR at page  51  lines 17~21, at page  52
line 23 to  page 53 line  4, and AppX E  at page 3.) This allegation is found  for Applicant.
1.k.  Applicant admits that she  was indebted  to  Creditor K  for a  past-due  debt in

20, and AppX E at page 3.) This allegation is found  for Applicant.
1.l. Applicant admits that she  is indebted  on  a  past-due  Payday  type  loan  in the

3.) This allegation is found  against Applicant.
1.m. Applicant admits that  she  was indebted  to  Creditor M  for a  past-due  debt  in
the  amount  of about $9,506.  This debt is  included  in  a  debt  consolidation  plan  by  which

Applicant.
1.q. Applicant denies that she  is indebted  to  her bankruptcy  attorney  for a  past-
due   debt   in   the   amount  of   about   $1,000.   As  this   debt   does  not   appear  on   her  or   the
Government’s  most   recent  credit  reports,   this  allegation   is  found   for  Applicant.   (TR  at
page 46 line  22 to page 47 line 6, GX 7  and  AppX F.)
