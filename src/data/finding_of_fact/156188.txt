In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a
through 1.f and 1.h through 1.n. (HE 3) He denied the SOR allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.g,
1.o, 1.p, and 1.q. (Id.) He also provided mitigating information. (Id.)
Applicant  is  a 50-year-old  Egyptian  and  United  States dual citizen  who  seeks  a
security clearance.  (GE  1)  He  has been  employed  as  a  senior engineer  for a  defense
contractor since 2017. (Tr. 18; GE 1 at 13) He has previously held a public trust position.
He has also been employed as a consultant from 2010 to the present. (Id. at 14) He has
exceptional  experience  as  an  engineer  and  held  important  professional  positions  with
multiple  companies  in  the  United  States.  (AE  A)  His  current  annual  salary  is  about
$160,000 plus bonuses. (Tr. 18) In 1995, he married, and his three children were born in
the United States in 1997, 2001, and 2006. (Tr. 21; GE 1 at 26-29)
Foreign Influence
In  1970, Applicant was born in Egypt.  (GE 1  at 9) From  1987  to  1995, he  attended
a  university  in Egypt;  he  received  a  bachelor’s degree  in  1992;  and a  master’s degree  in
1995. (Id. at 12) In  1995, he  immigrated  to  the  United  States. (Tr. 44) From  1995  to  2001,
he  attended  a  university  in the  United  States.  (SCA at 12)  In  1997,  he  received  a  master’s
degree  in the  United  States,  and  in 2001,  he  received  a  Ph.D.  in the  United  States. (Id. at
13)  In  2008, Applicant became  a  U.S. citizen.  (Tr. 48; SCA  at 8; GE  2  at 1)  He has not
taken  any  action  to  renounce  his Egyptian  citizenship.  (Id. at 9) From  2004  to  present,  he
has lived in the same residence in the United  States. (Id. at 10)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c allege and Applicant admitted his spouse, daughter, and
two  sons  are  dual citizens  of  Egypt  and  the United  States.  (Tr. 29) They reside  in  the
United States, and most recently went to Egypt in 2019. (Tr. 29, 32, 58) One son and one
daughter  have  Egyptian  birth  certificates  because  “it  was  natural  to  get  them  birth
certificates where we are citizens, but they never basically used it.” (Tr. 30, 49-50; GE 2
at 7) He did not intend to apply for a birth certificate for his third child. (Tr. 50; GE 2 at 7)
SOR  ¶¶   1.d   and   1.e   allege   and   Applicant  admitted   his   mother  and   two   sisters
(sister one  and  sister two) are citizens and  residents of  Egypt,  and  in  2019  as of  the  date
of  his SOR response, all  three  were  employed, either active  or semi-retired,  by  an  entity
that may  have  a  connection  to  the Egyptian  government.  (Tr.  30-32;  GE  1; GE  2) He  did
not  provide details  about the  importance  of their  positions or their  likelihood  of coming to
the   government’s  attention.   (GE  2)  At  his  hearing,  he   said  he   is  unsure   about  the
employment status of his mother and sisters  one and two, and he  did not explain why he
was no  longer aware of their  employment  status. (Tr. 31-33, 50) He  did not know  whether
sisters one  and  two  currently  work for  the  same  entity  as indicated  in the  SOR. (Tr. 33)
He said because  of  his “infrequent”  contact with  sisters  one  and  two, he  cannot be  sure
about their  current employment situation. (Tr. 53-54)  In  2017, Applicant communicated
with  his sisters and his  father-in-law  on  a  monthly  basis. (GE 1  at 29-34; GE  2  at 7). He
sporadically  communicates with  his mother every  week or every  other week, and  with  his
sisters every  two  to  three  months.  (Tr. 31-32,  51-56; GE  2  at 6)  His mother is aware of
his  profession   as  an   engineer;  however,  she   is  unaware  that  he   is   seeking   a   security
clearance. (Tr. 31)  SOR ¶  1.f  alleges  Applicant’s sister  three  is a  citizen  of Egypt and  a
resident of  Kuwait; however, after he  completed  his SCA,  she  moved  to  Egypt.  (Tr. 32-
33;  SOR  response)  Two   of   his  sisters  are   married,  and   he   does   not  know   what  their
husbands currently  do  for a living. (Tr. 33)
SOR  ¶¶  1.g,  1.h,  and  1.i,  allege  Applicant’s  mother-in-law,  father-in-law,  and
brother-in-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Egypt,  and  all  three  are  or  were  recently
employed by the same entity as his two sisters. His mother-in-law passed away, and SOR
¶  1.g  is  mitigated.  (Tr.  34)  His  father-in-law  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Egypt,  and  as
recently as 2019, he was in a semi-retired position with the entity. (Tr. 34; SOR response)
He may be receiving a pension from the Egyptian government or the entity that employed
him.  Applicant  said  at  his  hearing  that  he  is  unaware  of  his  father-in-law’s  current
employment. (Tr. 34) He most recently spoke to his father-in-law about three months ago,
and he usually speaks to his father-in-law about every six months. (Tr. 34-35, 56) Several
years ago, Applicant’s father-in-law visited Applicant in the United States. (Tr. 35) One of
Applicant’s  brothers-in-law  is  married  to  Applicant’s  sister,  and  his  brother-in-law  is  a
citizen and resident of Egypt. (Tr. 35) He was employed by the same entity that employed
his Applicant’s sister; however, Applicant said he did not know his brother-in-law’s current
employment.  (Tr. 35, 55;  GE  2  at  11)  He  speaks  to  his  brother-in-law  about  every six
months when he talks to his sister. (Tr. 36, 55) Applicant’s third sister who formerly lived
in  Kuwait  is  a  stay-at-home  mother.  (Tr.  55)  He  did  not  know  about  her  husband’s
employment. (Tr. 56)
SOR  ¶¶  1.j  and  1.k  allege  and  Applicant  admits  he  has  five  nieces  and  four
nephews who are citizens and residents of Egypt. (Tr. 36-37) About the only time he has
contact with them is when he visits Egypt. (Tr. 36) His nieces and nephews are children,
teenagers, and/or students. (Tr. 37)
Applicant  visited  Egypt  as  follows:  2009  (one  visit  for  11-20  days);  2010  (11-20
days); 2011 (three visits for 11-20 days, 6-10 days, and 11-20 days); 2012 (one visit for
11-20 days); 2013 (two visits for 6-10 days and 11-20 days); 2014 (one visit for 11-20
days); 2015 (one visit for 11-20 days); 2016 (one visit for 11-20 days); 2017 (one visit for
17 days), and 2019 (one visit for 11-20 days). (Tr. 52, 68; SCA at 43-60; GE 2 at 13) For
all of his trips to Egypt, he traveled with his wife and children, except for his trips in 2011
(twice) and 2013 (once). (Tr. 32, 58; GE 2 at 10) During his visits to Egypt, he usually
visited his mother, sisters, father-in-law, brother-in-law, and nieces. (Tr. 32, 35-36, 57)
Applicant said he travels to Egypt about every two years. (Tr. 57)
Applicant’s spouse  was born in Egypt in 1971.  (GE 1  at 22) Applicant met  her  in
Egypt.  (Tr. 47) She  became  a  U.S. citizen  around  2007. (Tr. 49) He and  his spouse’s total
U.S.  annual  income   is   about   $290,000.  (Tr.  25)  His  spouse   has  resided   in   the   United
States for 26  years. (Tr. 20) In  response  to  a  question  about his spouse’s contacts with
her father,   Applicant said,  “Probably   she  calls him,   but I don’t know.” (Tr. 56)  She  is a
successful professional who  owns her own  business.  (Tr. 19) Her equity  in the  building
where her office  is located  is $210,000. (Tr. 19, 25) Their  equity  in their  home  is  about
$780,000, and they have about $1,500,000 in U.S. investments and retirement accounts
for a total net worth in the United States of $2,490,000. (Tr. 25-27, 64)
Financial Connections to Egypt
SOR ¶ 1.l alleges Applicant owns an apartment in Egypt valued at about $80,000.
His mother lives in it, and he said he did not “actually control it or own it.” (Tr. 37, 51, 67)
His mother controls the property. (Tr. 68) He said the estimated value could be $1,000,
$50,000, or $80,000 and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator just put
the highest number they heard in their report. (Tr. 37)
SOR  ¶¶  1.m  and  1.n  allege  and  Applicant  admits  he  has  two  bank  accounts  in
Egypt with a total of about $87,000 in them. (Tr. 38-40, 68-69; SCA at 37) The amounts
in  the  accounts  vary  depending  on  his  visits  to  Egypt  and  his  investments.  He  has
transferred funds through his Egyptian accounts to the United States. (Tr. 39)
SOR ¶ 1.o alleges and Applicant admits he inherited a share of a building in Egypt
valued at about $330,000. (Tr. 41, 69-70; GE 2 at 9) Applicant disputed the valuation of
the building, and said he only had a one-eighth share. He explained that because of old
rental laws that prevent him from selling the building, the value is actually zero. (Tr. 41)
The cost to maintain the property exceeds the rent received from the tenants. (Tr. 41) He
did not even know the location of the building, and it is not in his name. (Tr. 70-71)
SOR  ¶  1.p  alleges  Applicant  is  eligible  to  receive  retirement  benefits  from  an
Egyptian  employer  valued  at  about  $10,000.  Applicant  worked  for  the  same  Egyptian
entity from 1992 to 1995 that employs or employed his sisters. (Tr. 42-43) He was on a
leave of absence from this Egyptian employment from 1995 until 2014. (SCA at 42) He
previously  indicated  he  expected  to  receive  retirement  from  this  Egyptian  employer  of
about $10,000. (SCA at 39; GE 2 at 8) He would be eligible for the retirement benefit at
age 60. (Tr. 73) At his hearing, he said he expects not to apply for any Egyptian retirement
because the amount received would be too low for him to make an effort to collect. (Tr.
42-43, 72)
SOR ¶ 1.q alleges that from 2015 to 2017, Applicant contributed about 25 percent
of  the total investment or about $8,000 to purchase an apartment in Egypt. (HE  2) He
agreed that he made the investment; however, he sold his share in 2017 or 2018. (Tr. 43,
63; HE 3; SCA at 38, 40-41)
In   sum   at  most,   Applicant’s  investments  in  Egypt  total  $80,000   (SOR  ¶   1.l)  +
$87,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.m  & 1.n) +  $41,625  (SOR ¶  1.o (1/8 X $333,000)) + $10,000 (SOR ¶
1.p) =  $218,625. Applicant disputed  the  SOR’s valuation  of  several of  these  investments,
and  he  concluded  his  Egyptian  investments  are less  than  ten  percent  and  possibly  less
than  five  percent of  the  net worth  for all  of his investments  in  the  United  States.  (Tr.  28,
39) He does not intend to retire in Egypt. (Tr. 28)
Applicant  said  he  does  not  vote  in  Egyptian  elections,  and  he  votes  in  U.S.
elections. (Tr. 44-45, 76) However, his July 10, 2017 OPM interview indicates he most
recently  voted  in  an  Egyptian  election  in  2014,  several  years  after  he  became  a  U.S.
citizen. (GE 2 at 2) He was not aware of any instance where the Egyptian government
approached his family members asking for information about Applicant. (Tr. 60) He was
unaware  of  financial  connections  between  the  Egyptian  government  and  the  entity
employing his sisters in 2019 when he completed his response to the SOR. (Tr. 62; SOR
response) Applicant was previously employed by the same entity in Egypt that employed
his sisters. (GE 2) He and his spouse do not have any siblings or close relatives living in
the United States other than those previously discussed. (Tr. 74-75) Applicant is willing
to  renounce  his  Egyptian  citizenship.  (Tr.  78;  GE  2  at  11)  If  his  family  in  Egypt  were
threatened  by  terrorists  or  criminals  to  obtain  classified  information  from  Applicant,  he
would report to security any attempt to coerce him for information. (Tr. 79) The United
States is his home, and he promised to continue to faithfully serve the United States. (Tr.
80)

Egypt
Egypt  and  the  United  States  belong  to  a  number  of  the  same  international
organizations,  including  the  United  Nations, International  Monetary Fund, World  Bank,
and World Trade Organization. Egypt is a Partner for Cooperation with the Organization
for  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe,  an  observer  to  the  Organization  of  American
States,  a  partner  in  the  NATO  Mediterranean  Dialogue,  and  a  non-party  state  to  the
International Criminal Court. Cairo hosts the headquarters of the League of Arab States.
The United States established diplomatic relations with Egypt in 1922, following its
independence from protectorate status under the United Kingdom. The United States and
Egypt  share  a  strong  partnership  based  on  mutual  interest  in  Middle  East  peace  and
stability,  economic  opportunity,  and  regional  security.  Promoting  a  stable,  prosperous
Egypt,  where  the  government  protects  the  basic  rights  of  its  citizens  and  fulfills  the
aspirations of the Egyptian people, will continue to be a core objective of U.S. policy.
U.S. assistance  to  Egypt has long  played  a  central role  in Egypt's economic and
military   development  and   in  furthering   the   strategic  partnership   and   regional  stability.
Since  1978,  the  United  States  has  provided  Egypt with  what now  totals over $50  billion  in
military and $30  billion  in economic assistance.
Egypt  and  the  United  States  signed  a  Bilateral  Investment  Treaty  in  1982  to
promote and facilitate investment between the two countries. Egypt and the United States
have signed a trade and investment framework agreement, a step toward creating freer
trade and increasing investment flows. American firms are active in most sectors of the
Egyptian economy, including oil and gas exploration and production, financial services,
manufacturing,  construction,  telecommunications  technology,  information  technology,
and the restaurant and hospitality industry. Flows of U.S. direct investment to Egypt were
$1.37  billion  in  2019,  bringing  the  accumulated  long-term  stock  of  U.S.  foreign  direct
investment to nearly $24 billion.
The U.S. has been largely involved in the Multinational Force & Observers (MFO)
operation  since  1982.  The  MFO  is  a  peacekeeping  operation  that  supervises  and
monitors the implementation of the security provisions of the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli Treaty
of Peace.
Examples  of  recent  cooperation  between  the  United  States  and  Egypt  are  as
follows: On March 14, 2021, Egyptian ENS SHARM EL-SHEIKH and USS SOMERSET
perform passing exercise; On February 23, 2021, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken's
call  with  Egyptian  Foreign  Minister  Sameh  Shoukry  occurred;  on  December  17,  2020,
USTDA  supported  major  refinery  upgrades  in  Egypt;  on  August  24,  2020,  the  Texas
National Guard and Egyptian military began a long-term military partnership; on August
17,  2020,  Secretary  of  State  Michael  R.  Pompeo  certified  that  Egypt  is  sustaining  the
strategic relationship with the United States and meeting its obligations under the 1979
Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty; and on January 8, 2019, an agreement was signed in Cairo
regarding defense  cooperation  between  the United  States  and  Egypt  and  entered  into
force.
Egypt is a republic governed by an elected president and unicameral legislature.
Presidential elections were held in March 2018. Prior to the elections, challengers to the
incumbent  President  Abdel  Fattah  al-Sisi  withdrew  their  candidacy,  citing  personal
decisions,  political  pressure,  legal  troubles,  and  unfair  competition.  Domestic  and
international  organizations  expressed  concern
limitations  on
association,  assembly,  and  expression  severely  constrained  broad  participation  in  the
political process. Egypt was under a government declared State of Emergency for all of
2019, and has been since the April 2017 terrorist attacks on Coptic Churches.
that  government
The   U.S.  Department   of   State   travel  advisory   for  Egypt  is  Level  3:  Exercise
increased  caution  due  to  terrorism  and  the  Embassy's limited  ability  to  assist  dual  national
U.S.  Egyptian  citizens who are arrested or detained. Do not travel to the Sinai Peninsula
(with   the   exception   of   travel  to   Sharm   El-Sheikh  by   air)  or  the   Western  Desert  due   to
terrorism,  and  to  the  Egyptian  border  areas due  to  military  zones.  The  U.S.  Government
has limited  ability  to  provide  emergency  services to  U.S.  citizens anywhere in the  Sinai
Peninsula,  as  U.S. Government employees are not authorized  to  travel to  these  areas
(with  the  exception  of  the  beach  resort  of Sharm  El-Sheikh;  travel to  Sharm  El-Sheikh is
permitted  only by air).
Egypt's borders are under military control; movement of non-military persons and
vehicles  is  substantially  restricted,  and  in  some  cases  prohibited  within  these  areas.
Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Egypt. Terrorists may attack with little or no
warning, and terrorists have targeted diplomatic facilities, tourist locations, transportation
hubs,  markets,  shopping  malls,  western  businesses,  restaurants,  resorts,  and  local
government  facilities.  Terrorists  have  conducted  attacks  in  urban  areas,  including  in
Cairo,  despite  the  heavy  security  presence.  Terrorists  have  targeted  religious  sites,  to
include mosques, churches, monasteries, and buses traveling to these locations.
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  has  assessed  Cairo  as  being  a  critical-threat
location for terrorism directed at or affecting official U.S. Government interests. Several
terrorist organizations operate in Egypt. The Islamic State-Sinai Province terrorist group
(also known as Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis (ABM), an ISIS affiliate) is the most active terrorist
group in Egypt; it pledged allegiance to ISIS in 2014.
Most terrorist attacks in  Egypt occur in the Sinai Peninsula and largely targeted
security forces, but terrorist attacks targeting civilians, tourists, and security personnel in
mainland Egypt remained a concern. Though early 2019 witnessed a series of improvised
explosive device (IED) incidents in greater Cairo, those incidents became more infrequent
as the year progressed. ISIS-Sinai Province (ISIS-SP) carried out the majority of the total
attacks in 2019, though it claimed no attacks in mainland Egypt and no attacks against
Western  interests.  ISIS-SP  responded  to  ISIS's  call  to  increase  attacks  to  avenge  the
terrorist group's territorial defeat in Syria in March. There were at least 151 IED-related
attacks in Egypt in 2019, of which ISIS-SP conducted at least 137 in northern and central
Sinai,  along  with  near-weekly  complex  assaults  on  government-fortified  positions,
demonstrating  the  terrorist  group's  freedom  to  maneuver  during  daytime  hours  and
geographic expansion of attacks westward, toward the Suez Canal Zone, and southward.
In addition, Harakat Sawa'd Misr (HASM) and al-Qa'ida allied groups such as Ansar al-
Islam are believed to be behind the spate of anti-western attacks in mainland Egypt in
2019, and  they also posed a continued threat.  A number of terrorism-related  incidents
were  reported  on  Egyptian  news  and  on  Egyptian  social  media  in  2019,  and  included
small arms attacks, IEDs, vehicle borne IEDs, kidnappings, executions, complex assaults,
ambushes, and targeted assassinations.
According  to  the  most  recent  U.S.  Department  of  State  Human  Rights  Report,
human rights issues in Egypt during 2019 included arbitrary or unlawful killings, including
incidents  that  occurred  while  making  arrests  or  holding  persons  in  custody  or  during
disputes with civilians. There were also reports of civilians killed during military operations
in Sinai. Impunity was a problem. There were instances of persons tortured to death and
other allegations of killings in prisons and detention centers. The government charged,
prosecuted,  and  convicted  perpetrators  in  some  cases.  A  local  human  rights
nongovernmental organization (NGO) reported 302 unlawful killings by the government
from January through June.
