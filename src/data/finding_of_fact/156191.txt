Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR,  with  explanations,  except  for
SOR allegation ¶ 4.b. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and
testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has a  Master’s
of  Science  degree, and  has been  employed with  the  defense contractor  since  June of
2010.  (TR  at  page  7  lines  9~25,  and  GX  1  at  pages  7  and  15.)  Applicant  has  held  a
security clearance since 2001, initially as a member of the U.S. Marine Corps. (GX 1 at
pages 36~38.) His “less than a year and a half” marriage was annulled in 2014. (TR at
page 22 lines 5~23, and GX 1 at page 23.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations & Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
1.a. and 4.c. Applicant admits that he failed to file his Federal  and state income
tax  returns  for  tax  years  2014~2018  in  a  timely  fashion.  He  mistakenly  “believed”  that
Applicant did  not  have  “to  file  the  taxes unless .  . . [he] owed  money.” (TR at page  25
line 18 to page 26 line 13.) In 2019 and 2020, he has filed returns for those tax years as
evidenced by documentation from the taxing authorities. (TR at page 40 lines 19~23, at
page 51 lines 7~34, and AppX I.)
Guideline   H  -  Drug   Involvement   and Substance   Misuse   &   Guideline   E   -  Personal
Conduct
2.a.  and  4.c.  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency, from  about 2009
to   at  least  August   of   2018   (a   period   of  more   than   ten   years)   while   holding   a   security
clearance. (TR at page 30  line  22 to page 31 line 2, at page 34 line  8 to page 36 line  19,
at page  37  lines 1-~25, and  at page  40  line  24  to  page  41  line  23.) He avers that he  did
not  know  the  use  of marijuana  was illegal under Federal  law, as  it was legalized  under
state law. (Id.)
This averment is countered by the fact  Applicant used  both  his former spouse’s
and  current  girlfriend’s  marijuana  prescription  to  obtain  the  drug.  (TR at  page  65  lines
7~11, at page 67 line 5 to page 68 line 11, and at page 71 line 17 to page 75 line 1.)
Furthermore,  such  usage  is  clearly  contrary  to  his  employer’s  drug  policy  that  clearly
states:  “Even  though  marijuana  has  been  legalized  in  certain  US  states,  it  is  still
considered  illegal  under  federal  law.  Therefore,  our  company  prohibits  use  even  in
locations where it is not against  state  law.” (TR at page  83  line  1  to  page  84  line  5, at
page   85   line   17   to   page   88   line   1,  and   GX   3   at  page   2.)   Applicant  intends  no   future
illegal drug usage. (AppX J.)
2.b.  and   4.c.   Applicant  used   Hallucinogenic  Mushrooms  twice   in  2010   while
holding  a  security  clearance. Again,  he  avers he  did not  know  such  use  was illegal. (TR
at page  23  line  16  to  page  24  line  2.) This averment does not pass scrutiny, particularly
as his employer warns  against  the  use  of  drugs that may  impair  decision  making. (TR at
page   75   line   2   to   page   76   line   7,   and   GX   3   at   page   2.)   Although   it  appears  that   his
employer  alludes  to   on-the-job   conduct,   “loose   lips  can   sink   ships”  off-the-job,  where
judgment  is  impaired   by   hallucinogens.   Applicant  intends  no   future   illegal  drug   usage.
(AppX J.)
Guideline G  - Alcohol Consumption  & Guideline  E  - Personal Conduct
3.a.~3.d.  and  4.c.  Applicant  admits  that  between  2011  and  April  of  2020,  he
consumed  alcohol  at  times  in  excess  and  to  the  point  of  intoxication.  (TR  at  page  31
lines  3~25,  and  at  page  42  lines  2~11.)  Applicant  further  admits  that  alcohol  was
involved, in about 2013, when he threatened a university employee, who was “cheating”
with his then wife. (TR at page 46 line 4 to page 47 line 6.) He also admits that alcohol
was involved, in about 2013, when he physically assaulted his former spouse who was
“cheating”  on  Applicant.  (TR at  page  43  line  12  to  page  45  line  9.)  In  2018,  Applicant
missed  work,  pursuant  to  his  doctor’s  instruction,  to  address  his  alcohol  consumption.
(TR at page 42 lines 12~22.)
Applicant  now   attends   Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  on   a   regular  basis,  and   last
consumed  the  intoxicant in  April of  2020, about a  year prior to  his hearing. (TR at page
31   lines  3~25.)  In   February   of   2021,  Applicant  was  evaluated   by   a   Licensed   Clinical
Social Worker, who  diagnosed  Applicant as suffering  from  “Mild Alcohol Use  Disorder
–   In  Sustained  Remission.”  (AppX   K   at   page   9,  emphasis  in   original.)  She   further
opined:  “No   Treatment   Warranted.  Continued   participation   in   the   fellowship  of
Alcoholics Anonymous, regular meeting with his  sponsor, and working the steps.”  (Id.)
Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
4.a.  Applicant  answer  “No”  to   Section   23   on   his  March  2018   SCA   as  to   “Illegal
Use  of  Drugs   .  .  .  in  the   last  (7)  seven   years  .  .   .  [and]  While   possessing   a   Security
Clearance.” (SCA  at pages 34~35.) This was a  willful falsification, as he  admits to  using
marijuana pursuant to the prescriptions of his former spouse and  his current girlfriend.
4.b. Applicant knowingly  provided  materially  false information  during  a  November
2018   interview   with   a   DoD  investigator  as  to   his  above-mentioned   illegal  drug   usage.
(TR at page  47 lines  14~21.)
4.c.  This allegation  has been discussed  at length, above.
