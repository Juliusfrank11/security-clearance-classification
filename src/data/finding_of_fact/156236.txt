Background Information
Applicant  is  a  59-year-old  business  analyst  who  has  been  employed  by  a
defense contractor since January 2019. (GE 1; Tr. 12-13) He seeks to retain his secret
security  clearance,  which  is  a  requirement  of  his  continued  employment.  (Tr.  33-34)
Applicant  has  held  a  clearance  since  he  was  on  active  duty  in  the  Navy,  discussed
below. (Tr. 33-34)
Applicant  received  his  high  school  diploma  in  1979.  He  went  on  to  earn  a
bachelor  of  science  degree  in  management  in  2015,  and  a  master  of  business
administration  degree  in  2016.  (Tr.  14-15,  26-28;  AE  A)  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Navy
from February 1983 to January 1992, and was honorably discharged as an Operations
Specialist First Class (pay grade E-6). Before he was discharged, he had been selected
for  chief  petty  officer,  was  surface  warfare  qualified,  and  had  earned  “several  ribbons
and awards.” (Tr. 16-17) After Applicant’s separation from the Navy, he held a number
of jobs, primarily as a defense contractor at various U.S. locations. (GE 1; Tr. 17-26)
Applicant  was  married  from 1983  to  1988,  and  that marriage  ended  by  divorce.
He  has  one  adult  son  from  that  marriage.  Applicant  remarried  in  1989,  and  has  five
adult  children  from  his  second  marriage.  All  of  the  children  from  his  second  marriage
are living at home and dependent on him for support. (GE 1; Tr. 16, 28-33, 41) His wife
is a homemaker and is not employed outside the home. (Tr. 33)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s  SOR  listed  18  allegations  under this  concern  consisting  of  15  debts
totaling $43,536, and three bankruptcy filings. The debts are established by his January
28,  2015  Electronic  Questionnaire  for  Investigations  Processing  (SF-86);  his  April  24,
2017 and June 24, 2015 Office of Personnel Management Personal Subject Interviews
(OPM  PSI);  a  June  30,  2015  Joint  Personnel  Adjudications  System  (JPAS)  Incident
History; his July 10, 2020, October 1, 2019, June 6, 2017,  and February 10, 2015 credit
reports;  his  July  26,  2011  Chapter  13  Bankruptcy  Documents;  November  21,  2011
Chapter  13  Bankruptcy  Documents;  April  17,  2012  Chapter  7  Bankruptcy  Documents;
July 11, 2005 Sworn Affidavit; and his March 10, 2020 SOR Answer. (SOR Answer; GE
1-12)
Applicant  stated  that  his  financial  problems  began  during  his  first  marriage
because  of  his  former  spouse’s  misuse  of  credit  cards  and  overspending  without
consulting  him.  Some  of  the  debts  from  his  first  marriage  continued  after  Applicant
remarried. He did not become aware of a large credit-card debt his former spouse had
incurred until 1992, when he attempted to buy a car.  In addition, he paid child support
for  the  son  born  during  his  first  marriage,  even  though  he  claims  not  to  be  that  son’s
biological father. Applicant filed his first bankruptcy, which was not alleged in the SOR,
in  the  late  1990’s.  Applicant  stated  that  he  filed  that  bankruptcy  because  he  had  five
children and the “bills were compounding.” (Tr. 34-44; GE 12)
Applicant’s history of indebtedness included a number of debts listed in his 2003
Chapter 13 bankruptcy and not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 43-46; GE 12) Applicant’s June
Incident  History  documents  Applicant’s  extensive  history  of
30,  2020  JPAS
garnishments  and  indebtedness  from  2005  to  2019.  One  of  the  garnishments  came
about because he accepted funds from FEMA, discussed below. (Tr. 46-47, 51; GE 4)
Applicant stated the two 2011 Chapter 13 bankruptcies were “mistakes” that ultimately
led  to  his  filing  a  2012  Chapter  7  bankruptcy.  He  was  granted  a  discharge  of  his
nonpriority  unsecured  debts  in  2014.  (Tr.  47-48)  Department  Counsel  questioned
Applicant about a 2012 $15,000 civil judgment against him involving a condominium he
attempted to purchase from a “shipmate.” Applicant was evicted from the condominium
with a $15,000 judgment against him. (Tr. 48-50)
Shortly after Applicant was evicted from  the condominium in 2012, he relocated
his family to a rental home in a coastal community that was struck by a hurricane before
he moved in. Applicant applied to FEMA for financial aid to recover from the hurricane.
Applicant stated that as part of the condition to receive financial aid, he was required to
move out of state, which he did. FEMA subsequently determined that he was ineligible
to receive the aid because he did not lose anything and attempted to recover the funds
paid to him. FEMA ultimately garnished Applicant’s wages for $9,300. (Tr. 51-54)
As  noted,  Applicant’s  SOR  listed  18  allegations  consisting  of  15  debts  totaling
$43,536  and  three bankruptcies. These  debts  vary  in  type  of  creditor and  amount  and
range  from  a  $52  delinquent  medical  bill  to  a  $26,530  charged-off  automobile  loan.
Applicant  explained  that  he  had  taken,  or  was  taking,  various  steps  to  address  these
debts.  However,  he  did  not  produce  any  documentary  evidence  to  corroborate  his
claims  of  settlement,  payments  made,  or  attempts  to  resolve  these  debts.  Nor  did
Applicant’s SOR Answer contain any documentation of debt resolution. Applicant stated
that he sent “about 17 letters” to creditors seeking resolution of his debts, but had  not
received  any  replies.  (Tr.  56-70)  He  did  not  submit  copies  of  any  of  the  letters  as
exhibits.  Applicant  submitted  an  unexecuted  mitigation  plan  to  regain  financial
responsibility. (AE A)
Applicant  lost  his  employment  through  a  reduction  in  force  (RIF)  and  he  was
unemployed  from  March  2013  to  September  2014.  During  this  timeframe,  Applicant
drew  unemployment  for  six  months  and  withdrew  money  from  his  401K  for  living
expenses.  (Tr.  73,  75,  78;  GE  1)  An  investigator  with  the  Office  of  Personnel
Management  (OPM)  interviewed  Applicant  on  June  24,  2015,  and  April  24,  2017
regarding  his  financial  situation.  Applicant  explained  that  he  did  not  send  letters  to
creditors  after  his  2017  OPM  interview  because  he  was  RIF’d  a  second  time  and
unemployed from January 2018 to January 2019. However, Applicant did not reinitiate
his  plan  to  establish  payment  plans  with  his  creditors  after  beginning  his  current
employment in January 2019. After Applicant was RIF’d, he drew unemployment for six
months and used his savings and money from his 401K for living expenses. (Tr. 58-59,
74, 78) Applicant stated that after beginning his current job his focus was on providing
for  his  family  and  regaining  his  financial  footing.  He  added  that  after  the  COVID-19
lockdown, three of his adult children who were working lost their jobs and moved in with
him. (Tr. 59, 74)
At  his  hearing,  Applicant  submitted  a  matrix  summary  that  reflected  his  debts
were pending verification except for two debts that he claimed were current. He did not
submit  any  documentation  that  reflected  any  of  his  SOR  debts  were  resolved.  (AE  A)
The monthly budget Applicant submitted at his hearing reflected a net monthly income
of  $7,200  with  a  net  monthly  remainder  of  $2,076.  However,  he  orally  amended  that
monthly  remainder  during  his  testimony  because  his  expenses  had  gone  up  after  his
son  and  two  daughters  lost  their  jobs  and  were  dependent  on  him  for  support.  He
estimated  his  net  monthly  remainder  was  “probably  about  $200  to  $300  a  month  right
now.” (Tr. 70-71; AE A)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  was  earning  a  good  income  since  he  began
working for his current employer, but had experienced a financial setback. He stated he
had “six people that were relying on my income to sustain them and pay their bills, and
pay my bills and also pay the debt that I had with my friends.” Applicant explained that
his  budget  was  pre-COVID.  (Tr.  72-73,  76-77)  He  also  submitted  evidence  of  a
business  he  formed  in  2018  to  develop  a  business  process  for  Government
procurement  and  acquisition.  (AE  A)  The  record  does  not  contain  any  evidence  that
Applicant  derived  any  income  from  this  business.  He  completed  an  online  credit-
counseling course, date unknown. (AE A)
At the conclusion of the hearing, I advised Applicant that he had not mitigated his
debts. (Tr. 77) As noted, I held the record open until January 29, 2021, to afford him an
opportunity  to  submit  additional  evidence.  I  informed  him  that  he  needed  to  produce
documentation for each SOR debt and an updated budget among other things. (Tr. 77-
83)  As  noted  Applicant  timely  submitted  AE  B  through  E.  However,  his  post-hearings
submissions  did  not  contain  any  documentation  demonstrating  that  the  15  listed  SOR
debts had been mitigated or addressed in any meaningful way apart from what appears
to  be  a  settlement  agreement  that  may  be  linked  to  SOR  ¶  1.i  (credit-card  collection
account  for  $219).  The  settlement  agreement  provided  indicates  three  $72  payments
remained.  (AE  F)  Applicant’s  post-hearing  matrix  summary  reflects  that  debts  were
resolved  by  settlement  agreement,  barred  by  statute  of  limitation,  were  paid,  or  were
removed.  However,  Applicant  did  not  provide  documentation  of  debt  resolution  in  his
post-hearing exhibits except for one debt that may have been listed on his SOR. (AE D-
E)  He  stated  in  his  forwarding  email,  “Note:  Creditors  were  not  forthcoming  with
agreement documents.”
Character Evidence
Applicant’s  resume  documents  a  post-Navy  career  primarily  as  a  defense
contractor. He submitted two work-related professional certificates. (AE A) His company
president  wrote  a  favorable  reference  letter  on  his  behalf,  stating  that  Applicant  is
required  to  maintain  a  secret  security  clearance  to  remain  on  the  company’s  current
contract.  The  company  president  also  lauded  Applicant’s  performance  noting  that
Applicant  received  “great  reviews”  from  the  Government  customer  and  his  peers.  He
added that the company considers Applicant “a key role in the success of the project.”
Applicant received a “100/100” for his most recent employee performance  review. (AE
B, AE C)
