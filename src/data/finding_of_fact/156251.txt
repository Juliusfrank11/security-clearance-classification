Applicant  is a  38-year-old  married  man  with three pre-teen children. A previous
marriage ended in divorce in December 2011. (Item 7 at 26)  After finishing high school, he
earned  an  associate’s  degree  in  May  2007.  Currently,  he  is  working  towards  finishing
college.  (Item 1 at 19) He has been working in the security analysis profession since 2009
and has been working for his current employer since 2014. (Item 1 at 19)
Applicant  is  highly  respected  on  the  job  and  in  his  community.  According  to  a
coworker who has known him for five years, he “has shown time and time again” that he is
a dependable associate who “can effectively handle complex tasks with the highest level of
professional manner.”  (Item  1  at 22)  Applicant’s supervisor characterizes him  as a  key
member of the staff, who “goes out of his way” to accept undesirable work shifts, and to
help with tasks that are beyond the skill sets of other employees. (Item 1 at 23)  A neighbor
describes him as “a ‘class act’ who is involved in the community, and is frequently helpful
to his neighbors.” (Item 1 at 26)
Applicant smoked marijuana with various degrees of frequency between 2004 and
2018.  The most frequent use occurred between 2004 and 2007 when he used it six to ten
times, typically when visiting longtime friends from college. (Item 5 at 46-47: Item 7 at 4) He
disclosed this use to an investigator in 2010, and stated that he had no intention of using
marijuana in the future.  (Item 7 at 4)
Applicant used marijuana again in 2015, four years after being granted a security
clearance. (Item 6 at 7) After disclosing this use to an investigative agent as part of another
security  clearance  investigation,  Applicant  again  promised  to  quit  smoking  marijuana.
Applicant  used  marijuana  on  another  occasion  in  2018.  (Item  7  at  6)  In  March  2019,
Applicant  completed  an updated  security clearance application form. He disclosed the
2015 marijuana use, and stated that he had no intention of using it again in the future.
(Item  3  at  38)  He  did  not  disclose  the  2018  marijuana  use  on  his  updated  security
clearance application in March 2019.  In April 2019, an authorized investigator interviewed
Applicant. During the interview, Applicant, without confrontation, told the agent about the
2018 use of marijuana. (Item 6 at 7) In responses to interrogatories executed in January
2020, Applicant stated that he had not used any marijuana since 2018, and that he would
use “none, going forward.” (Item 6 at 13) In a statement of intent executed in September
2020, Applicant reiterated his intent not to use marijuana again. (Item 1 at 16)
Applicant’s security clearance application, completed in February 2013, contained
the following question:
Section 23 – Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity . . . In the last seven years,
have you illegally used any drugs or controlled substances?
Applicant answered  “no,” failing  to  disclose  his marijuana  use  from  2004  to  2007.  (Item  1  at
3)  SOR subparagraph 2.a alleges that this omission constitutes a falsification.
During an interview with an investigative agent in April 2013, Applicant, when asked
if he had ever used marijuana in the past seven years, answered affirmatively, stating that
he used it in approximately fall 2006. (Item 6 at 9)  SOR subparagraph 2.b alleges that his
failure to disclose use in 2004, 2005, and 2007, constitutes a falsification.
Applicant contends that his 2013 security clearance omission and his underreporting
of  his  marijuana  use  in  the  mid-2000s  were  unintentional  oversights.  (Item  1  at  3)
Applicant  disclosed  his  marijuana  use  between  2004  and  2007  on  an  earlier  security
clearance application in 2010. (Item 5 at 46) He “was under the impression that already
reported uses did not need to be reported again.” (Reply at 1)
SOR  2.c,  as  amended,  alleges  that  Applicant  falsified  a  security  clearance
application completed in March 2019, when he disclosed marijuana use in February 2015,
but failed to disclose marijuana use in December 2018. Applicant admits that he did not
include the December 2018 use on the 2019 security clearance application, as alleged in
the SOR. (Item 1 at 33) According to the investigative agent who interviewed him in April
2019, Applicant disclosed this information without being asked about it.
Applicant  did  not  disclose  his  marijuana  use  between  2004  and  2007  when  he
interviewed with an agent in April 2019. (Item 6 at 5) SOR subparagraph 2.d alleges that
this  omission  constituted  a  falsification.  Applicant  admits  that  he  did  not  disclose  this
marijuana use during the 2019 interview; however, he explained that he believed that the
agent  was  only  asking  him  about  use  within  a  seven-year  scope  of  the  date  of  the
interview. (Item 1 at 4) Applicant had disclosed his marijuana use from 2004 to 2007 during
an investigative process in 2010. (Item 7 at 4)
