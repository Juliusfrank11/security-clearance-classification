In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations. His admissions are
adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a federal contractor performing the duties
of a uniform protection officer. He began working at his present job in June 2018. He also
has a second job in the nongovernment private sector. He earned his bachelor’s degree
in 2009. He has never married. He has one child, age 15, with whom he shares legal and
physical custody with the child’s mother. (Tr. 6, 21-22, 24-26; GE 1, 3)
The  SOR  alleged  eight  delinquent  accounts  (student  loans,  car  repossession,
credit  cards,  and  consumer  debts)  totaling  approximately  $36,450.  The  debts  are
established by credit reports from July 2018, October 2019, and April 2020; Applicant’s
personal subject interview (PSI) with a defense investigator in June 2019; and his SOR
admissions. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.h) (AE 2-5; Answer to SOR)
Applicant explained that his financial difficulties were caused by trying to raise his
child  while  attending  college,  helping  his  mother  with  her  bills,  and  short  periods  of
unemployment between regular jobs. On February 11, 2021, Applicant entered into a five-
month  contract  with  a  debt  relief  company  (DRC)  whereby  the  DRC  would  negotiate
settlements with his creditors and perform other actions to repair his credit. Applicant paid
$4,000 for this service. At the end of five months (July 12, 2021), Applicant would need
to execute a new contract with the DRC. It is unclear whether Applicant would have to
pay an additional $4,000 to have the DRC continue acting on his behalf. He was advised
by the DRC to pay his smaller debts first then work his way up to the larger balances. (Tr.
30-31; AE C)
The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a-$11,614. This debt resulted from a car repossession. Applicant opened
this loan in 2014, and in 2018 the car was repossessed for non-payment and a deficiency
balance accrued to him. He has not made any payments toward this debt. He is following
the  DRC  plan  and  waiting  to  pay  smaller  debts  before  he  pays  this  one.  This  debt  is
unresolved. (Tr. 42-45; GE 3)
SOR  ¶  1.b-$9,117.  Applicant  opened  this  credit  card  in  2013  and  it  became
delinquent in 2015. He has not made any payments toward this debt. He is following the
DRC  plan   and   waiting   to   pay   smaller  debts  before  he   pays  this  one.  This  debt  is
unresolved. (Tr. 44-45; GE 3-4)
SOR  ¶¶  1.c-1.e,  1.g-$4,318;  $4,198;  $4,138;  $2,159.  Applicant  incurred  his
student loans in approximately 2007 and they became delinquent in 2015. Up until his
hearing, he had not contacted his loan servicing agency about trying to rehabilitate his
loans. He was following the DRC’s advice and waiting to deal with these debts after he
paid  some  of  his smaller debts.  Post-hearing,  Applicant contacted a  company that will
assist  him  in  rehabilitating  his  student  loans  with  him  paying  $5  a  month  beginning
October 1, 2021. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 45; GE 3; AE D)
SOR  ¶  1.f-$3,355.  Applicant  opened  this  credit  card  in  2015  and  it  became
delinquent in 2019. He documented two payments of $850 each settling this debt in May
2021. He used the DRC’s strategy to pay this debt. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 32-37, 39;
GE 4; AE B)
SOR  ¶  1.h-$456.  Applicant  opened  this  credit  card  in  2008  and  it  became
delinquent in 2017. He documented a payment of $214 settling this debt in April 2021. He
used the DRC’s strategy to pay this debt. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 37-38; GE 4; AE B)
Applicant paid a non-SOR debt in the amount of $351 in May 2021. (Tr. 40-41; AE
B)
Applicant testified that he is paying all his current financial obligations. Based upon
budget  information  he  gave  during  his  testimony,  his  monthly  residual  after  paying  all
expenses  is  approximately  $500.  Other  than  hiring  the  DRC  (during  his  testimony,
Applicant  sometimes  referred  to  the  DRC  as  a  “law  firm”),  there  is  no  evidence  that
Applicant received any financial counseling. He claimed that all his federal and state tax
returns were filed and any taxes owed were paid. (Tr. 50-57, 60-61)
Applicant provided two letters from work supervisors who have worked with him
since  2018.  They  described  Applicant  as  honest,  forthcoming,  dependable,  and
responsible. (AE A)
