Applicant is a 42-year-old install technician. He is divorced and has no children.
Applicant is presently engaged to marry. The couple live together in a rented apartment
and  share  expenses.  (Tr.  18)  Applicant  makes  a  monthly  payment  of  $400  for  his
automobile. After taxes, Applicant earns approximately $62,400 a year. He has no recent
periods of unemployment.
Coming from a military family, Applicant aspired to military service. He served in
the military for a “couple of months” before being honorably discharged in the late 1990s
due  to  medical  issues.  (Tr.  8,  20)  He  was  previously  vetted  and  granted  a  security
clearance, including a top-secret  clearance  granted  in 2018. He earned  an  associate’s
degree in 2014. He has outstanding federal student loans totaling approximately $35,000
dating back to his associate degree studies, circa 2011-2014. He admits all allegations
related  to  his  student  loans  (SOR  allegations  1.a,  1.c-1.h),  but denied  knowledge  of  a
medical debt for $639 (SOR allegation 1.b). The debt at 1.a has been paid and Applicant
does not recognize, and cannot validate, the debt at 1.b. (Tr. 64-65)
When  Applicant  first  started  his  associate’s  degree  program,  he  met  with  a
financial officer at the institution. (Tr. 22) His education was to be financed through the
school and through government student loans. During his program, he paid the school
about $175 per month toward his school-based loan. (Tr. 24) By graduation in 2014, he
had settled his obligation to the institution and accepted a job offer. (Tr. 26-27) At that
point, he accepted a brief deferment on his federal student loans before he started making
$175  monthly  payments  toward  them  via  the  telephone.  Soon,  the  government  was
asking for monthly payments of $375 to $425 a month. (Tr. 27-30)
At  the  time,  Applicant  was  unable  to  pay  more  than  $175  a  month  toward  his
federal student loans (Tr. 28) He was making about $42,000 a year and living with his
parents, who were having health issues and needed his assistance. They lived in a costly
region.  After  three  to  six  months,  he  ultimately  ceased  making  payments  on  these
government-backed  student  loans.  Meanwhile,  between  2014  and  2018,  Applicant
provided  his  parents  with  spare  money  and  time  to  help  with  their  declining  health,
medical expenses, and care. (Tr. 55-56) These expenses increased when his mother was
diagnosed  with  Stage  4  cancer.  Spare  funds  were  also  expended  toward  the  health
issues of both his sibling and himself.
In the interim, Applicant tried to get his federal student loans removed on the theory
that the institution had subsequently lost its accreditation. (Tr. 32) He believed this made
his diploma invalid. He thought this notion to be true when he was later told by another
school  that  they  would  not  accept  credits  from  his  prior  school  because  it  had  lost  its
accreditation. (Tr. 35-36) However, after researching the issue, Applicant found that he
was still liable for the related federal student loans because the school was still accredited
at the time of his 2014 graduation. (Tr. 37)
Applicant  then  believed  the  obligation  had  disappeared  when  his  2017  or  2018
credit  report  showed  the  accounts  as  closed.  (Tr.  33-34)  He  filed  an  inquiry  with  the
government concerning these loans in 2018, but never received a response. (Tr. 38) He
was alerted to the fact the student loans were still owed during a March 2019 investigative
interview and review of a different credit report. (Ex. 2) Confused, Applicant researched
further. He consulted two organizations which promised they could put him on the path to
some form of loan forgiveness. Indeed, he paid one of the entities $600 for its services.
Soon, however, he suspected these organizations to be conducting scams. (Tr. 73)
Applicant then found a government contractor in the business of  counseling and
assisting people regarding federal student loan repayment. He started working with it in
2020. He enrolled in its program in October 2020 with payment of $300 and entered into
an agreement to start repayments in September 2021, at the end of a current program
created  to  relieve  student  loan  holders  from  their  obligations  during  the  recent  global
pandemic. At present, he is both financially able and motivated to meet his obligations
under that program.
