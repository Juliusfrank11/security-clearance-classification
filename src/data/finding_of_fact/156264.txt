Applicant  admitted  two  of  the  SOR  allegations  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.g),  with
explanations,  and  denied  the  remaining  allegations.  There  is  no  SOR  ¶  1.f.  The
admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 54 years old. She has worked for a government contractor since July
2016. She has also been a member the National Guard-Army Reserve since 2002. She
received her bachelor’s degree in 2012 and her master’s in 2015. She is married for the
second time, has four adult children, and is supporting three minor grandchildren. (Item
3)
Applicant  sought  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  her  military  position,
which  was  denied  in  October  2004.  Applicant  sought  reconsideration  of  the  denial
decision,  but  in  August  2009  the  denial  was  reaffirmed  based  upon  her  unresolved
financial  issues.  In  August  2012,  a  second  reconsideration  was  undertaken  and
Applicant  was  granted  a  conditional  security  clearance.  The  reconsideration  letter
included  a  warning  that  any  future  failure  to  resolve  her  delinquent  debts  or  incurring
other  unfavorable  financial  information  could  lead  to  the  suspension  of  her  clearance.
(Items 4-7)
The SOR alleged six delinquent debts totaling approximately $53,000. The debts
are comprised of a past-due mortgage note, collections accounts (credit card, consumer
debt,  and  student  loans),  and  a  charged-off  credit  card.  The  debts  are  established  by
her  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  credit  reports  from  September  2019  and
March  2020,  and  her  SOR  admissions  in  her  answer.  The  SOR  also  included  an
allegation stating that Applicant had a history of failing to meet her financial obligations,
which  included:  being  denied  a  security  clearance  in  2004  and  2009  because  of
financial problems; being criminally charged for writing insufficient fund checks in 1999;
and filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1997. (Items 2-7, 9-12)
Applicant  attributes  her  financial  problems  to  not  being  “a  good  steward  of  my
personal finances over the years.” She also claimed that she hired a financial advisor in
January  2020,  but  she  provided  no  further  information  regarding  how  the  financial
advisor  assisted  her.  She  failed  to  supply  any  information  about  her  current  financial
picture. (Item 2)
The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
Mortgage  Note  (SOR  ¶  1.a)-$24,804  past  due.  Applicant  claimed  that  a
decrease in her income caused her to get behind on her mortgage payments. Her credit
report indicates that her original loan was opened in April 2017 and the date of her first
delinquency was  in  December 2017.  It  also shows  a  history of  missed  payments from
2018  through  2020.  Applicant  documented  that  she  sought  a  mortgage  modification
agreement in approximately March 2020. She failed to provide documentation showing
that  the  modification  was  ever  executed,  or  showing  her  monthly  mortgage  payments
were  being  made.  The  loan  modification  documents  she  provided  were  all  unsigned.
This  debt  is  unresolved.  (Items  2  (including  her  attachment  with  loan  modification
documents), 11-12)
Student  Loans  (SOR  ¶  1.b)-$19,520  collection.  Applicant  claimed  that  her
student  loans  have  been  paid  and  documents  this  with  a  statement  by  a  student  loan
collection  service  showing  Applicant  has  “paid  in  full”  on  the  student  loans  with  an
original  balance  of  $19,158.  This  same  documentation  lists  three  additional  student
loans  with  a  total balance  of  $2,825.  There  is  no  indication  that  these  three  loans  are
delinquent.  This  debt  is  resolved.  (Item  2  (including  her  attachment  with  student  loan
documentation))
Credit  Card  (SOR  ¶  1.c)-$7,219  collection.  Applicant  admitted  this  debt  and
claimed  she  entered  into  a  settlement  agreement  with  a  collection  company.  Although
she presented documentation showing the terms of the proposed settlement offer, she
failed  to  present  documentation  that  she  actually  executed  the  offer  and  made  the
settlement  payments.  This debt  is  unresolved.  (Items  2  (including  her  attachment  with
settlement offer), 11-12)
Credit  Card  (SOR  ¶  1.d)-$961  charged  off.  Applicant  documented  that  she
settled this debt with a collection company in May 2020. This debt is resolved.  (Item 2
(including her attachment with settlement documentation))
Consumer  (telecommunications)  (SOR  ¶  1.e)  $526  collection.  Applicant
disputed this debt claiming that it was wrongfully assessed against her for failing to turn
in cable equipment. She also claimed she paid a collection company to settle the debt in
June  2020.  While  she  does  not  supply  documentation  corroborating  the  settlement
transaction,  the  absence  of  this  debt  on  the  latest  credit  report  does  corroborate  her
assertion of payment. This debt is resolved. (Items 2, 12)
The   final  SOR  allegation   (SOR   ¶   1.g,  note:  there   is  no   SOR  ¶   1.f)   details
Applicant’s history of  financial difficulties. She admitted this allegation, including that she
was  denied   a   security  clearance   in 2004  and   2009   because   of  her financial problems;
that she  was criminally charged  for writing  insufficient fund  checks in  1999; and  that she
filed  and  received  a  Chapter 7  bankruptcy  discharge  in 1997-1998.  Her admissions  are
supported  by  documents from  her  2004-2012  security  clearance  adjudication;  a  Federal
Bureau  of  Investigation  (FBI)  identification  record;  and  a  docket  report  from  her  1997
Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (Items 2, 4-7, 9-10).
