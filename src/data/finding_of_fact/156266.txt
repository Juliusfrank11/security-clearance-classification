Applicant is a 63-year-old man with three adult children.  He has been married to his
current  spouse  since  April 2015.  He  was  married  previously from 1985 to 2014 to the
mother  of  his  children.  (Tr.  31)  That  marriage  ended  in  divorce.  Applicant  earned  a
bachelor’s  of  science  degree  in  1985.  (GE  2  at  2)  He  has  been  hired  by  a  federal
contractor  pending  the  outcome  of  the  investigative  process.  (Tr.  16)  Currently,  he  is
making ends meet with financial help from his family members and through unemployment
benefits. (Tr. 69)
Applicant and his former wife legally divorced in January 2014. Under a separation
agreement, Applicant agreed to pay his ex-wife $5,000 per month in alimony and $500 per
month  in  health  insurance  costs.  (GE  3  at  55)  The  court  calculated  this  support  as  a
percentage of Applicant’s annual salary, which had ranged from $200,000 to $290,000
over the years preceding the divorce.  (Answer at 3; GE 3 at 258) Under the terms of the
separation agreement, the settlement could be amended for changed circumstances. (Tr.
22)
Applicant paid alimony, as ordered, for nearly two years after the divorce. (Tr. 22)
Then,  in  November  2015,  he  lost  his  job.  Consequently,  he  was  unable  to  make  the
alimony payments. The day after Applicant lost his job, he retained an attorney, and filed a
motion to reconsider and modify the spousal maintenance order. (AE D) The hearing was
scheduled  for  approximately  June  2016.  (Tr.  52)  Although  Applicant’s  ex-wife  was
subpoenaed, she failed to appear. (Tr. 53; GE 3 at 11)) The court then dismissed the case.
A few months later, Applicant re-filed the motion.  His ex-wife was again subpoenaed, but
did not appear for the hearing. Rather than issue a default judgment, the court dismissed
the case. (Tr. 53)
Subsequently, Applicant’s attorney withdrew from the case. (AE E) Approximately
two months later, in September 2016, Applicant retained another attorney. (Tr. 54) By then,
Applicant’s unemployment was beginning to stress him financially, as his unemployment
benefits had ended approximately four months earlier. (GE 3 at 155) Consequently, he
could not afford to continue paying his new attorney, whereupon, she withdrew from the
case.
While Applicant was unemployed, he discovered that he had not been withholding
enough money to pay his federal income taxes, resulting in a $40,000 debt. (GE 3 at 155)
Shortly after Applicant’s second attorney withdrew from the case, Applicant sold his home,
used  the profit to satisfy the income tax  debt,  and  relocated  to  another state  to  live  in his
sister’s home.  (GE 1 at 9; GE 3 at 156)
After relocating, Applicant continued to have difficulty finding a job, and remained
unemployed for another four months. (GE 3 at 156) In February 2017, he obtained a job
and relocated again. (GE 3 at 156) In September 2018, Applicant was terminated from his
employment.  He  has  been  either  unemployed  or  underemployed  since  then,  and  has
relocated three more times. (GE 3 at 11, 156)
Applicant made no spousal support payments for two years after losing his job in
November  2015.  This  prompted  his  ex-wife’s  attorney  to  file  a  motion  to  enforce  the
judgment in late 2016. (GE 3 at 71) On January 23, 2017, the court entered a default
judgment in favor of Applicant’s ex-wife for delinquent spousal-support payments missed
between November 2015 and January 2017, totaling $132,000. (GE 3 at 76)  Applicant
received a copy of the judgment, but did not make any payments towards it, prompting his
ex-wife in January 2019 to file a petition for enforcement and for breach of contract. (GE 3
at 76) Applicant was served with notice in March 2019. (GE 3 at 156) In June 2019, the
court issued a default judgment in favor of Applicant’s ex-wife, awarding her “$457,675,
together  with  post-judgment  interest  at  a  rate  of  5%  per  annum  until  paid  in  full,”  and
$228,837 in attorney fees. (Answer at 6; Tr. 21)
In February 2017, Applicant’s mother-in-law moved in with  him and his spouse.
(Answer at 4) Shortly thereafter, she had a heart attack. After spending nine months on life
support, she died in November 2017. (Answer at 4) Pre-occupied with his mother-in-law’s
declining health and his frequent relocations while unemployed, Applicant failed to “look in
on his ex-spouse’s situation or what was happening in the courts.” (Answer at 4)
In  November  2019,  Applicant  retained  an  attorney  to  contest  the  judgment  for
support awarded his ex-wife. (Answer, Attachment F; GE 3 at 4) That  month, Applicant’s
attorney informed Applicant’s ex-wife’s attorney that Applicant could not  pay the judgment,
and proposed paying a reduced amount of $100,000, in $1,400 increments for 71 months,
to  settle  his support delinquency.  (Answer, Attachment  F  at  2)  Applicant talks with his
attorney approximately once a month to discuss options for resolving the delinquency. (Tr.
24)
According  to  Applicant’s divorce attorney, the  ex-wife’s counsel told him  that he
would consider the offer. As of June 2020, Applicant’s divorce counsel had not received a
response. (Answer, Attachment G) The parties have worked together to resolve other post-
divorce matters. Specifically, Applicant’s attorney in December 2019 negotiated the division
of one of Applicant’s 401k accounts.
Applicant is highly respected by his former coworkers and friends. According to one
former coworker, who worked with him for several years between 2008 and 2015, Applicant
was “the go-to guy for rolling out projects,” who could always be counted on to perform a
superior job. (GE 3 at 103) According to another former coworker, Applicant has a broad
skill-set and  was always willing  to  help a  coworker. (GE 3  at 181)  Applicant is also a  leader
in his church, and is active in the  community. (GE 3 at 176-177; Tr. 20)
