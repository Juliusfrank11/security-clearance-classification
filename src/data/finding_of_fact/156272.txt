Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  The  admissions  are  adopted  as
findings  of  fact.  After  a  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  46  years  old.  She  has  worked  for  a  government  contractor  since
December  2019.  Before  that  she  experienced  unemployment  from  July  2019  until
December 2019. She was fully employed for approximately 10 years before then.  She
received  her bachelor’s  degree  in  1996. She is  divorced for the  second time  (dates of
divorce: 2015 and 2019) and has two children for whom she pays $350 monthly in child
support. (Items 4-5)
The SOR alleged 12 delinquent debts totaling approximately $29,100. The debts
are comprised of collections, charge offs, and past-due accounts (credit card, consumer
debt,  medical  debt,  student  loans,  and  an  auto  repossession).  The  debts  are
established  by  Applicant’s  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  her  background
interview in December 2019, credit reports from November 2019 and December 2020,
and her SOR admissions in her answer. (Items 3-7)
Applicant attributes her financial problems to martial instability, as she had gone
through two divorces in the past four years. She believed her most recent divorce was
inequitable and required her to pay most of the marital debt, which caused her to rely on
credit  cards.  She  entered  into  a  debt  management  plan  in  March  2019  and  made
several payments into the plan, but discovered that the fees were so high none of her
money  was  going  toward  paying  her  debts.  From  January  2020  to  January  2021  she
paid  $2,248  to  the  debt  management  company,  which  was  less  than  half  of  what  it
required. No payments were made towards her debts. She ended the contract. (Item 5;
AE A)
Applicant  failed  to  present  documentation  showing  that  she  made  payments  on
any  of  her  debts.  She  provided  a  current  budget  that  reflects  that  she  has  a  monthly
remainder of $39 after she pays all her expenses. She documented that she ended her
lease in March 2021 and planned to move in with her mother, thereby saving her $1,400
monthly. She believes she can use this amount to pay her delinquent debts. She also
proposed a payment plan over the course of 11 months whereby she could settle all of
her  debts.  This  plan  assumes  that  she  can  pay  $2,500  each  month  toward  her  debts
and that each creditor agrees to accept a 50 per cent settlement. She does not explain
where the$1,100 monthly surplus will come from to make her plan payments (assuming
$1,400 comes from her rent savings). She did not provide any documentation reflecting
settlement discussions with any creditors. None of her SOR debts have been resolved.
