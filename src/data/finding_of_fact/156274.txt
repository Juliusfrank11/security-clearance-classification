After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 52 years old, a high school graduate, never married, with an adult son.
Since August 2017, she has been employed by a defense contractor. (Items 3 and 5.)
The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns
for 2011 through 2018 and that as of the date of the SOR, the 2011 through 2015 returns
remained unfiled. The SOR also alleges that Applicant owed $255 to the IRS. (Item 1.)
Although Applicant denied the failure-to-file allegations (Item 2), the record shows that
she belatedly filed those returns in 2018 and 2020. (Item 5 at 6.)  Applicant proffered a
number of reasons for her failure to timely file her returns:
She was waiting to hear from the IRS that she calculated her return correctly;
She had financial challenges (car repairs and a water leak at her home);
She had trouble getting the required documentation (e.g., W-2s and 1098s);
She was working full-time and had a part-time job as well;
She was busy as the primary care giver of her mother who had dementia; and
She did not know how to file returns for previous unfiled years. (Items 2, 4, and 5.)
