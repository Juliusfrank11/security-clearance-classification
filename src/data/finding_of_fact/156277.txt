In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted some of the allegations, with explanations,
and denied others. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a review of the
pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working at
his present job in July 2018. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 2004 until
he has honorably discharged in May 2014. He deployed to Iraq twice and to Afghanistan
once. He was awarded at least one Army Commendation Medal and Army Achievement
Medals for his service. He also served in the Army Reserve from 2014 to 2016 when he
was discharged. He has a high school diploma and has taken some college courses. He
is divorced and has two children from his marriage, for whom he was obligated to pay
child support. (Tr. 6, 22-26; GE 1, 3)
The  SOR  alleged  nine  collection  accounts  and  seven  charged-off  or  past-due
debts  (student  loan,  child  support,  credit  cards,  and  consumer  debts)  totaling
approximately  $29,500.  The  debts  are  established  by  credit  reports from  March  2018,
May  2019,  and  November  2020;  Applicant’s  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  with  a
defense investigator in October 2018; and his SOR admissions. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.p) (AE
3, 5-7; Answer to SOR)
Applicant explained that his financial distress began when he incurred some debts
while  still  in  the  Army  and  after  his  divorce  in  2012.  He  also  was  unemployed  from
September 2016 to July 2017, which caused him to get behind on  his debt payments.
Before  his  hearing,  he  contacted  a  bankruptcy  attorney  about  possibly  filing  for
bankruptcy protection, but at this point he has not pursued it beyond the initial contact. In
July 2020, he hired a debt repair company (DRC) to clean up his credit report. He stated
that  they did  some  positive  work, but  he  believed  he  could  do  what  the  company was
doing without paying the fee. He was paying approximately $89 a month for this service.
He stopped in November 2020. (Tr. 25, 46; GE 3)
The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a-$10,782. Applicant incurred this credit-card debt while in the military.
He  claims  that  he  is  making  monthly  payments  of  $240  that  come  directly  out  of  his
paycheck, which began in October 2020. He stated that he could provide six months of
supporting documentation showing his payments. He was given until June 30 from the
date  of  hearing  to  provide  this  documentation,  but  he  failed  to  do  so.  This  debt  is
unresolved. (Tr. 29-30)
SOR ¶ 1.b-$4,380. Applicant incurred this debt while he was in the Army when he
took out a loan to visit his children. Once he was discharged, he could no longer afford
the payments and this debt became delinquent. He claimed that he contacted the creditor
to work out a payment plan and promised to submit supporting documentation. He failed
to do so. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 38-39)
SOR ¶ 1.c-$3,269. Applicant disputed this debt during his hearing testimony and
a credit report supports that dispute. His most recent credit report does not list this debt.
This debt is resolved. (Tr. 40-43; GE 6, 7)
SOR ¶ 1.d-$2,509. Applicant incurred this education debt in approximately 2016,
when  he  attended  college.  He  could  not  keep  up  with  the  payments  when  he  was

a payment plan. Nothing has happened since then. He plans to contact the school again.
This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 43-44)
SOR  ¶  1.e-$1,936.  This  debt  is  from  Applicant’s  delinquent  child  support
obligation.  He  acknowledged  that  he  fell  behind  in  his  payments  when  he  was

his  outstanding  support  delinquency  and  had  documentation  to  support  his  claim.  He
failed to provide this documentation. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 33-34)
