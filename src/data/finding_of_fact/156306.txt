The  SOR alleges under Guideline  F that, as of  September 4, 2020, Applicant owed
$32,207  in delinquent credit-card debt (SOR ¶  1.a  - $1,685; SOR ¶  1.g  - $8,620; SOR ¶  1.j
- $1,065; SOR ¶  1.k  - $1,362; SOR ¶  1.l  - $715; SOR ¶  1.m  - $6,726;  SOR ¶  1.n  - $8,624;
and  SOR ¶  1.x  - $3,410); medical collection  debts totaling  $4,846  (SOR ¶  1.b  - $1,218;
SOR ¶  1.c - $1,520; SOR ¶  1.d  - $308; SOR ¶  1.e  - $25; SOR ¶  1.s - $158; SOR ¶  1.t  -
$355; SOR ¶  1.u  - $445; SOR ¶ 1.v  - $475; and SOR ¶ 1.w  - $342);  a cell phone debt in
collection  for $1,044  (SOR ¶  1.f); an  insurance  debt in collection  for  $238   (SOR  ¶  1.q);  and
a  water bill in collection  for $50  (SOR ¶  1.r). Applicant defaulted  on  federal  student  loans  in
collection  for $50,469  (SOR ¶  1.h) and  $28,511  (SOR ¶  1.i) and  a  tuition  debt of  $754
(SOR ¶  1.p). Additionally, Applicant had  a  mortgage  loan  foreclosed  in 2015  (SOR ¶  1.o).
Under Guideline  J, Applicant was allegedly  convicted  of  February  1993  (SOR ¶  2.f)
and November 1999  (SOR ¶  2.e)  driving  under the  influence  (DUI) offenses,  and  arrested
for DUI in April 2008  (SOR ¶  2.d) and  February  2014  (SOR ¶  2.b). She  was also arrested
in  February  2012  for  battery  (SOR  ¶  2.c)  and  in  June  2015  for  probation  violation  –
reckless driving (SOR ¶ 2.a). (Item 1.)
When Applicant answered the SOR, she admitted the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c-1.d,
1.f-1.i, and 1.n and the mortgage foreclosure. She indicated that the debt in SOR ¶ 1.n had
been transferred to the account in SOR ¶ 1.g, so they are the same debt, and the debt has
been paid off. She explained that she had taken steps to arrange repayment plans or had
established plans in place for other debts. She denied the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b,
1.e, 1.j-1.m, and 1.p-1.x, and stated that she did not recall them. As for the alleged arrests,
Applicant admitted her arrest for violating her probation in 2015 and explained that she was
unable to satisfy the community service component because of illness. She denied that
she was charged with DUI in February 2014 in that she was instead charged with reckless
driving – reduced from DUI. She also denied a February 2012 battery in that the “entire
case/charge was dropped.” Regarding the April 2008 incident, Applicant explained that she
was not charged with DUI, but rather with reckless driving with alcohol. Applicant admitted
her DUIs that occurred in November 1999 and February 1993, and explained that she
“learned valuable lessons from these past mistakes of misdemeanor/charges listed.” (Item
2.)
After considering the evidence accepted in the record, I make the following findings
of fact:
Applicant  is  50   years  old,   never been   married,  and   has  no   children.  She   has  a
bachelor’s degree in information systems, having  pursued  her college  studies on  and  off
between August 1989 and August 2009. (Item  3.) She  paid for her education  in part with
student loans. She  has worked  for a  succession  of  several companies  in the  information-
technology  sector starting  in January  1999  but experienced  some  unemployment from
March 2000  to  May  2000, November 2003  to  January  2006,  and  March  2006  to  June  2006,
after layoffs. She  then  worked  as a  systems engineer for a  defense  contractor from  June
2006  to  June  2012, with  some  brief funding-related  periods  of unemployment  totaling  about
a   year  during   that  time.  Applicant  was  granted   a   Secret   clearance   for  her  duties  in
approximately June 2006. (Item 3.)
Financial  Considerations
Applicant worked for another defense contractor from June 2012 to May 2013, when
she  was  laid  off.  Unemployed  until  October  2014,  she  fell  behind  on  several  financial
obligations, including on her mortgage loan, which she obtained for $103,976 in July 2007.
The loan became approximately $35,000 past due. (Item 3.) The company then holding her
mortgage foreclosed and sold her residence in October 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.o). (Items 2-5.)
From October 2014 until another layoff in December 2014, Applicant was employed
as a senior test specialist for a research corporation involved in contract work for the DOD.
She began having health issues at that time and for almost the next two years, she was
self-employed as a systems engineer. Her clearance eligibility lapsed for lack of DOD-
contract work. (Item 2.) From October 2016 to November 2016, Applicant worked full time
as a housekeeper at a motel. (Item 3.)
In  early  November  2016,  Applicant  relocated  to  her current  locale  to  work as  a
contract systems engineer for a large defense contractor on a military base. In December
2016, she had emergency surgery that led to her hospitalization for two weeks when she
had no health benefits or income. She began receiving pay on January 17, 2017. (Item 2.)
In September 2017, she was laid off. She collected unemployment compensation  until
February 2018, when she began working for a computer company as a technical specialist.
Applicant  had  new  medical  issues  in  June  2018  that  caused  her  to  take  short-term
disability leave until August 2018. (Item 2; AE A.) It is unclear to what extent her care was
covered by health insurance. She had to take leave without pay from her job due to health
concerns and resigned from that employment in February 2019 because of health issues.
With an offer for employment from his current employer contingent on contract funding
from the DOD, Applicant lived off her savings from February 2019 until June 2019 while
she recovered her health. (Items 2-3.)
On  March  27,  2019,  Applicant  completed  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security
Positions (security clearance application or SCA) for her current employer. In response to
inquiries  concerning  delinquency  involving  routine  accounts,  Applicant  disclosed  the
foreclosure of her mortgage loan in October 2015, which she indicated was caused by
long-term unemployment after she was laid off from a defense contractor position due to
loss of DOD contract funding. The loss of income led her to lose her home and good credit.
Concerning actions taken to address her financial situation, Applicant stated, “Currently
employed – Current Car loan – Renting Condominium Property – repairing credit status up
to date.” She listed no other financial issues on her SCA. (Item 3.) Applicant was granted
an interim clearance in approximately May 2019. (Item 2.)
As of April 10, 2019, Applicant’s credit report showed that she owed nothing on the
foreclosed mortgage loan as of November 2015. However, she had several outstanding
delinquencies on her credit record. The history of those accounts and repayment efforts, if
any, is set forth in the following table.

On September 4, 2020, the DCSA CAF issued an SOR to Applicant in part because
of the aforesaid delinquent accounts on her credit record as of April 2019 or April 2020 or
both. (Item 1.) When she answered the SOR on September 24, 2020, Applicant attributed
her financial issues to unemployment or lack of income while self-employed and more
recently to some health setbacks in December 2016, June 2018, and February 2019 that
compromised her income. She denied any unwillingness to address her indebtedness. She
indicated  that  she  took  “a  tremendous  60%  pay  cut”  while  working  for  the  computer
company  from  February 2018  to  February 2019  (Item  2),  but  she  did  not  provide  any
details about her income or expenses. There is no evidence that she has had any financial
or budget counseling. The latest credit report in the record is from April 2020. It reflected a
lack of progress toward addressing several of the debts in the SOR, as set forth in the
above  table,  but  also  that  she  was  making  timely  payments  of  $379  monthly  on  an
automobile loan obtained for $15,654 in February 2018. (Item 6.)
Criminal Conduct
On  her  March  2019  SCA,  Applicant  responded  affirmatively  to  an  inquiry  into
whether she had been arrested in the last seven years, and she listed a February 2014
reckless driving offense. She stated that she briefly crossed over into the bike lane on the
right side of the road and was driving too slowly. (Item 3.) Available information shows a
more extensive arrest record, including several alcohol-related offenses.
On February 10, 1993, Applicant was arrested for misdemeanor DUI – alcohol. She
was convicted of the offense on May 6, 1993, and fined $700. (Item 7.) Applicant admits
the offense but denies any recall of the details. (Item 2.)
On  November  20,  1999,  Applicant  was  again  arrested  for  misdemeanor  DUI  –
alcohol. She was convicted of the offense on November 27, 2000, and sentenced to 11
months and 29 days of probation. (Item 7.) Applicant admits the offense but denies any
recall of the details. (Item 2.)
Applicant  was  arrested   on   April  12,  2008,  for  DUI,   1st   offense,  a   2nd   degree
misdemeanor.  (Item  7.) Applicant recollects that she  was arrested  in her driveway  by  a
highway   patrolman   who   claimed   she   was  driving   recklessly.  The   officer  searched   her
vehicle, and  Applicant recalls that he found  “an  old flask from  a  ‘beach  day’  a  month  prior
with  the  smell  of  alcohol inside, but no  liquid.” Court records show  that,  on  January  19,
2010, she  was convicted  of  reckless driving  with  alcohol. (Item  2.)  She  had  to  complete  a
victim impact course and a “rehab” course for the offense. (AE A.)
On  February  13, 2012, Applicant was arrested  for battery  –  touch  or strike, a  1st
degree  misdemeanor. (Item  7.) She  was charged  with  battery  –general. On  February  17,
2012, the  charge  was dropped  for failure to  prosecute  (abandonment or no  information
filed),  and   her  case   was  closed.  Applicant  asserts
incident  was  a
“misunderstanding.” (Item 2; AE A.)
that
the
On February 26, 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. She refused
to submit to a blood alcohol test. In June 2014, she was convicted of reckless driving –
reduced from DUI, placed on probation for 12 months, and ordered to complete 72 hours
of community service. (Items 2, 7.) Applicant asserts that she was in “a poor place” at that
time. She had been laid off, could not find DOD-contract work, and was losing her home to
foreclosure. (Item 2.)
On June 11, 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with probation violation for
failure to complete her community service for the February 2014 reckless driving offense.
She  asserts  that  illness  prevented  her  from  fulfilling  her  community  service.  She  was
sentenced for the offense on July 24, 2015. At the discretion of the probation officer, she
completed  her  community  service  working  in  a  corrections  facility,  and  her  case  was
closed. (Items 2, 7.)
Applicant asserts that she has learned “valuable lessons from these past mistakes,”
citing her accomplishment in earning her college degree, her contributions in the defense
and aerospace industry, and changed circumstances. (Item 2.) She denies any current
consumption of alcohol. (AE A.)
Character and Work References
Applicant was rated as an excellent performer by her manager for her work in 2020.
She  exceeded  her  manager’s  expectations  and  showed  herself  to  be  a  self-directed
systems software engineer expert. Applicant consistently delivered above-average overall
team performance while mentoring new application engineer co-workers. She maintained a
positive outlook and had respect for others in the workplace. Applicant was recognized by
engineering  leadership  for  providing  very  good  support  to  their  team.  A  department
manager described Applicant as a “wonderful partner to work with.” He found her detailed
in her requests, timely in following up, courteous, and professional. (AE A.)
