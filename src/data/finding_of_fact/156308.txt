Applicant is a 31-year-old mathematician, employed by a government contractor
since May 2019. He is also employed as a retail service technician since May 2019. He
was  unemployed  from  October  2018  to  December  2018,  and  held  various  laborer
positions since leaving college. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2014 and a master’s
degree in 2017. He married in March 2018 and has one child born in 2019.
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  F  that  Applicant  is  delinquent  on  16  debts
totaling about $135,000. Applicant admitted to all of the SOR debts. Fourteen listed debts
are  student  loans owed  to  the U.S. Department of  Education  (DOE) (12 debts totaling
about $102,783) and Sallie Mae (two accounts totaling about $25,771). The remaining
two  allegations  list  consumer  debts.  These  debts  include  SOR  ¶  1.o  in  the  amount  of
$1,570 that was settled and paid in full in July 2020. The final consumer debt, SOR ¶ 1.g
is a debt for $7,045. This debt has been resolved as part of a two-year repayment plan
and the first installment was made in September 2020.
Applicant  held  a  series  of  low-paying  labor  positions  since  graduating  from
graduate school in  an  effort to  “keep  a  roof  over my family’s head.”  He discussed loan
repayments on his student loans, but was unable to make the “up-front payments required
by the agencies.” (GE 2) His most significant employment with a defense contractor was
obtained in 2019. Since the end of December 2020, he was promoted and received a pay
raise  to  an  annual  income  of  about  $80,000.  Applicant  also  contacted  his  consumer
creditors and paid one debt and entered into a repayment plan on another. He was also
able to enter into repayment schedules with DOE and Sallie Mae to consolidate and begin
repayments  plans.  He  started  payments  in  both  plans,  and  appears  to  have  sufficient
monthly income to pay debts and expenses.
Applicant submitted a letter of support from his current manager who recommends
Applicant  as  a  trustworthy  employee  who  complies  with  all  rules  and  regulations.
Applicant also noted his 100% disability from partial hearing impairment, and his child has
the same disability. Applicant fully accepts his financial situation and asserts that since
obtaining his current position, he has made significant progress in resolving his consumer
debts and student loans.
