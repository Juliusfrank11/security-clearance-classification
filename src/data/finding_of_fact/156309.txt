In  his  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations
pertaining to financial considerations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c.). Applicant’s admissions
and  comments  are  incorporated  herein.  After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings
of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  a  senior  field  support  coordinator  with  his  current  sponsor  since  July  2019.  He
previously  served  as  a  senior  telecom  project  coordinator  with  another  employer  from
March 2009 until July 2019. A 1993 high school graduate, he attended a university for
several years earning college credits, but no degree. He has never served with the U.S.
military. He was initially granted a secret clearance in 2002, and it was renewed in 2009.
He reported that he has never been married, and that he had no children, but during an
interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM)  in
August 2019, he acknowledged having two children, born four months apart in 2010.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can
be found in the following exhibits: Item 7 (Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Petition, filed June 24,
2010); Item 6 (Court Record of Bankruptcy Filings, dated May 6, 2020); Item 5 (Chapter
7 Bankruptcy Petition, filed May 22, 2019); Item 3 (SF 86, dated July 25, 2019); Item 4
(Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated August 7, 2019); and
Item 8 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated August 14, 2019).
Applicant has a history of financial difficulties going back over a decade that have
resulted in many accounts becoming delinquent. The SOR alleged three financial issues
regarding bankruptcies, as set forth below:
In  June  2010,  he  filed  a  voluntary  petition  seeking  bankruptcy  protection  under
Chapter  7  of  the  U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code.  (Item  2,  at  1)  He  reported  approximately
$257,986  in  liabilities  with  creditors  holding  secured  claims  (state  tax  lien;  a  judgment
lien;  a  vehicle;  and  a  mortgage);  $4,000  in  liabilities  with  creditors  holding  unsecured
priority  claims  (federal  income  tax);  and  $69,137  in  liabilities  with  creditors  holding
unsecured nonpriority claims (various commercial accounts; credit cards; a time-share;
and  student  loans).  At  the  time,  he  reported  an  average  net  monthly  income  of
approximately $2,572, and an identical amount in monthly expenditures. He reaffirmed
the mortgage debt, but because this was considered as a no-asset bankruptcy, most of
his other debts were discharged on October 14, 2010. (Item 7)
Between  December  2010  and  January  2016,  Applicant  filed  for  bankruptcy
protection under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on seven occasions. On each
occasion,  the  case  was  dismissed.  (Item  2, at  1;  Item  6)  He made  no  assertions,  and
offered no documentation, to support any conclusion that the Trustees involved in any of
the Chapter 13 filings had completed a payment plan, received funds from Applicant, or
made any payments to any creditors. Furthermore, there were no assertions by Applicant
that he  had  paid  the Trustees  any funds.  Instead,  he  stated  that his intention for filing
under Chapter 13 “was to help retain all of [his] assets house, cars, boat and other assets
that belong to [him].” (Response to FORM)
In  May  2019,  he  again  filed  a  voluntary  petition  seeking  bankruptcy  protection
under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. (Item 2, at 2) He reported approximately
$199,829 in liabilities with creditors holding secured claims (a mortgage); and $99,956 in
liabilities with creditors holding unsecured priority claims (domestic support obligations to
two separate women; commercial accounts; credit cards; and student loans). At the time,
he  reported  an  average  net  monthly  income  of  approximately  $1,856,  and  $2,631  in
monthly expenditures, leaving him with a deficit of approximately $775. On August 30,
2019,  because  this  was  considered  as  a  no-asset  bankruptcy,  most  of  his  debts  were
discharged.  (Item  5)  During  his  OPM  interview,  Applicant  estimated  that  his  liabilities
totaled around $10,000, and they were purportedly caused because of the expenses he
was left with following his father’s funeral costs. (Item 8, at 5) His reason for filing under
Chapter  7  was  “to  remove  the  debts  and  give  [himself]  a  fresh  start  to  rebuild  and
reestablish good credit.” (Response to FORM)
Applicant acknowledged that in addition to those funeral expenses, he charged his
travel, clothing, jewelry, and dining out on his credit cards to the point where they became
“maxed  out.” (Item  8, at 5)  Nevertheless, he denied that his accounts  were  delinquent
before he filed for bankruptcy, claiming, instead, that his attorney had advised him to stop
paying his creditors. (Item 8, at 5) He acknowledged that he had over-extended himself
financially, and did not think he would be able to pay his debts, so he filed for bankruptcy.
(Item 8, at 9) With respect to his travel expenses, between August 2015 and April 2019,
Applicant took several international trips to Mexico (three occasions), as well as trips to
Jamaica, Barbados, Belize, Honduras, and Costa Rica. (Item 3, at 22-43), with his most
recent trip occurring in April 2019 – one month before he filed his May 2019 bankruptcy
petition.
As  of  May  2019,  Applicant  owed  over  $58,587  in  subsidized  student  loans  and
over $25,739 in unsubsidized student loans. (Item 2) His current net monthly income and
monthly  expenses  are  not  known.  It  is  also  unknown  if  he  has  a  monthly  remainder
available  for  discretionary  spending  or  savings.  Furthermore,  there  is  no  evidence  of
financial  counseling  or  a  budget.  Accordingly,  it  is  difficult  to  determine  if  Applicant  is
currently  in  a  better  position  financially than  he  had  been,  or  if  he  has  returned  to  his
earlier spendthrift ways.
