Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  60-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  2019.  He  is  married  after  a  previous
divorce, and has two grown children, and one stepchild. (TR at page 19 line 8 to page
26 line 13.) Applicant attributes his admitted past-due indebtedness to his divorce.
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a. Applicant admits a past-due, credit-card debt of about $53,000  that is directly
related  to  his divorce.  He is making  monthly  payments  averaging  about  $150; and  has
paid a   total   of  $5,950  towards  this debt, as evidenced   by   documentation.  (TR at page
26  line  14  to  page  29  line  9, and  AppX  F.) I find  a  good-faith  effort  to  satisfy  this debt;
and  as such, this allegation is found  for Applicant.
1.b.  Applicant  admits   a   past-due,  credit-card   debt  of  about   $15,000   that  is  not
related  to  his  divorce.  He has done  nothing  to  address  this  debt,  despite  admitting  the
ability to do so. This allegation is found against Applicant.
1.c.   Applicant  admits   an   outstanding   judgment,   related   to   a   credit-card  debt,   in
the  amount of  about $13,000.  He has done  nothing  to  address this debt. (TR at page  31
line   23   to   page   34   line   7,  at   page   35   line   8   to   page   36   line   14,   and   at   page   37   lines
7~18.) This allegation is found  against Applicant.

making  monthly  payments of  $300  towards the  other,  as supported  by  documentation.
(TR at page  35  line  8  to  page  37  line  18, and  AppXs E  and  K.)  I find  a  good-faith  effort
