Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 42 years old, divorced, and has two children, ages 14 and 21. He and
his former wife were together since 1997, and they married in 2006. She left him suddenly
in about 2017 and they divorced in August 2017. He provides monthly child support to his
former wife. (Tr. at 8-9, 14-23.)
Applicant graduated from high school in 1996 and earned an associate’s degree
in June 2004. He began working for a DoD contractor in January 2021 after being laid off
by a different employer due to the Covid-19 pandemic in August 2020. He works as an
aircraft structures mechanic and has worked in the aviation industry for over 15 years. He
has experienced short  periods of  unemployment in 2010-2011, 2014, 2016, 2017,  and
2019,  in  addition  to  his  unemployment  in  2020.  He  submitted  his  SCA  in  July 2019  in
connection with a position as a machine mechanic. His current position requires a security
clearance as did his immediate past employer, his original clearance sponsor. He has not
held a clearance in the past. (Tr. at 8-9, 14-24.)
Due  to  his  divorce  and  several  recent  periods  of  unemployment,  Applicant  has
incurred a number of debts he could not pay. He also experienced difficulties filing his
Federal and state tax returns. The SOR identifies Applicant’s tax filing deficiencies  and
delinquent debts and also alleges that he failed to disclose 13 of his debts in his SCA.
(Tr. at 18-19, 30.)
SOR Allegations
1.  Under  Guideline   F,   the   SOR,  as  amended,   sets  forth   19   allegations.  In   his
Answer, Applicant denied  or disputed  most of  the  debts,  while  admitting  he  had  unfiled
tax returns. The  details surrounding each allegation  are the following.
a.  Unfiled   Federal  tax   returns  TYs   2016   and   2017.  Applicant  admitted   this
allegation   in   his  Answer,  blaming   the   unavailability   of   necessary   paperwork   to   file   his
returns.  As noted, the  SOR was amended  to  add  TYs  2018 and  2019  to  this allegation  to
conform  to  Applicant’s  testimony. He  testified  that after his marriage  ended, he  put his tax
returns  on   the   “back   burner”  and   tried   to   focus  on   the   welfare   of   his  two   children.  He
candidly  admitted  that he  was depressed  over the  loss of  his 20-year relationship  with  his
wife.  He   has  recently   been   in   contact  with   the   IRS   and   once   he   has  the   necessary
information   from   the   government,   he   plans   to   work   with   a   tax   preparer  and   file   his
delinquent tax  returns. His former wife  has told  him  that she  filed  returns for 2016  for both
of  them. Applicant needs to  confirm  this information. At another point in  his testimony, he
said that he knows he  has to file the  2016 and 2017 returns. He does not believe that he
owes any  taxes for the  years in  question, though  he  does not know  that for sure  until he
files. (Tr. at 24-30, 60-62.)
b. Unfiled  state  tax returns for TYs  2016-2017.  Applicant admitted  this allegation
in  his Answer, blaming  the  unavailability  of  necessary  paperwork  to  file  his returns.  As
noted, the  SOR  was amended  to  add  TY  2018  and  2019  to  this allegation  to  conform  to
Applicant’s testimony. He  testified  that his state  tax  returns for the  tax  years in  question
are  unfiled. He  has talked  with  someone  at the  state  tax  office  and  was instructed  to  file
his TY 2017 state return by April 3, 2021. The record is silent as to whether he complied.
(Tr. at 29-30.)
c. Collection  Account Owed  to  Municipality  A  - $304.  This bill is for a  utility  account
that Applicant’s  landlord  kept in  his name  after  he  vacated  an  apartment.  He  has disputed
this  bill  with   the   landlord.  He   testified   that  the   landlord   agreed   with   his  dispute   and
promised  to  provide  a  letter correcting  its error. He  never received  the  letter. He  provided
no  documentation in support of his claims in this dispute. (Tr. at 31-32, 37.)
d.  Collection  Account Owed  to  Former Landlord- $1,939.  This account is with  the
same  landlord  as the  one  discussed  in  1.c above. The  landlord  kept Applicant’s deposit
and  charged  him  this additional fee. The  landlord  claimed  that Applicant dumped  a  sofa
in  front of  his apartment when  he  vacated. Applicant denies that the  sofa  belonged  to  him
or that he left any furniture  behind. He testified that he  did  not break the lease  prior to its
termination date. He  disputed  the  debt verbally after receiving a  letter from  the  landlord’s
law firm. He advised the  law firm  that he  would not pay this charge. He also testified that
he  disputed  the  debt online  with  the  three  major credit bureaus. GE  3  and  the  two  other
credit reports in  the  record  reflect Applicant’s dispute  of  this debt.  He  never  heard further
about the  dispute. He provided no  documentation in support of his claims in this dispute.
(Tr. at 32-39; GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 1; GE 5 at 2.)
e. Medical Collection Account - $572.  Applicant had medical insurance to pay this
bill.  He   also   paid   his   co-pay.  He   denies  he   owes  anything   further   because   of   his
insurance. He  believes this is a  matter between  the  insurance  company  and  the  medical
provider. He  has disputed this debt with the credit bureaus. He  was unaware of this debt
prior to receiving the SOR. He does not know the  status of this debt.  (Tr. at 39-40.)
Other  Medical  Collection  Accounts  –  f.  ($570);  g.  ($203);  h.  ($995);  i.  ($679);  j.
($65); and k. ($116). Same as 1.e, above.
l. Collection  Account Owed  to  Fitness Facility  - $324.  Applicant advised  his  fitness
facility  that he  was moving  out of  the  area  and  he  wanted  to  cancel his contract with  the
facility.   The   manager   responded   that  Applicant   could   only   terminate   the   contract  if   the
area  to  which  he  was moving  had  no  facility  owned  by  the  same  company. He  testified
that he  showed  the  manager his new  location  on  a  map  and  that there  was no  company
facility  near that location  for him  to  use  in  the  future. He  said  that the  manager agreed
with  him  and  said  he  would  terminate  the  contract.  After Applicant  received  the  SOR, he
contacted  the  company  and  disputed  the  bill. He  was advised  that  the  company  would
investigate  the  matter, but he  never heard  further. He  has not  followed  up  with  the  creditor
and has no documentation to support his dispute. (Tr. at 38, 40-41.)
m.  Collection   Account   Owed   to   Retail   Business  -  $93.   This  debt   arose   out  of
Applicant’s  subscription  for a  water cooler. According  to  the  Government’s credit reports
in   the   record,  this  debt  dates  back   to   2014   or  2015.  He  claims  he   cancelled   the
subscription  when  he  moved. The  July  2019  SCA  reflects that Applicant only  moved  once
between  January  2007  and  July  2019, and  that was in  October 2018. He  never clarified
that inconsistency. Applicant testified  that the  company  picked  up  the  equipment,  but then
charged   him   for  it  claiming   they   never  received   the   equipment.   He   provided   no
documentation to support his dispute. (Tr. at 41-42; GE 1 at 8-9; GE 2 at 1.)
n.  Charged-Off   Account  on   an   Auto   Loan   -  $18,988.   In   June   2013,  Applicant
purchased  a  vehicle  and  financed  it  with  the  creditor identified  in  the  SOR.  That car was
repossessed  in  late  2014  or early  2015  during  a  period  Applicant was unemployed. His
SCA   reflects  that  he   was   laid   off from   a   job   in   July   2014,  and   he  started   a   new   job   in
December 2014. He  claims that the  amount due  as alleged  in  the  SOR is the  full  value  of
the   vehicle,  and   not  the   balance   due   after  the   car  was  resold.  GE   4   reflects  that  the
original charge  off  was in  the  amount of  $27,019  and  the  present amount owed  is $18,988.
Applicant  testified  that he  was never provided  with  notice  of  a  deficiency  due  after the  car
was resold  by  the  creditor. His testimony  that he  is unaware of  the  amount of  the  debt he
owes on  the  defaulted  loan  is not credible. Moreover, his testimony  reflects that he  never
inquired about any further obligations he  had  under the car loan following his default. He
disputes the  amount of  the  debt,  but provided  no  documentation  to  support his dispute.
This debt arose  before the  date  of  the  SCA and  Applicant was obviously  aware  that the
creditor  repossessed  the  vehicle  due  to  his  extended  default in his  monthly  payments  in
2014  when  he  was unemployed. (Tr. at 42-45; GE 1 at 15-17; GE 4 at 4; GE 5 at 3.)
o. Collection  Account Owed  to  Communications Business - $593.  This debt arises
out of  a  contract Applicant  had  with  a  cellphone  provider. He  testified  that he  cancelled
the  contract due  to  overcharges and  poor service  and  then  the  company  sent him  a  bill
for  the   balance   due   under  the   contract.   He   disputes  that  the   creditor  had   the   right  to
charge  him  anything  further. He  provided  no  documentation  to  support his dispute. This
delinquency arose after the  date of the  SCA. (Tr. at 45-46.)
p. Collection  Account - $757.  Applicant does not recognize  this collection  agency
or  the   name   of   the   original   creditor  listed   in   GE   5.  He   disputes  this  debt  without  any
supportive documentation. (Tr. at 46-50; GE 5 at 2-3.)
q. Collection  Account - $614.  The  record  reflects that this debt was originally  owed
to   a   bank.  Applicant  did   not  initially   recognize   the   names  of   the   bank   or  its  collection
agency. He  then  recalled  that this bank  gave  him  a  payday  loan  that  he never repaid. He
does not dispute  this debt and  testified  that  he  is willing  to  repay  it. This debt became
delinquent after the  date of the SCA. (Tr. at 50; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 3-4.)
r. Charged-Off Account Owed  to  Bank  - $514.  Applicant agrees he  owes this debt.
He  has recently  made  a  payment arrangement with  the  bank, with  the  first payment due
on   March  19,  2021   and   a   final  payment  due   in   April  2021.  Applicant  provided   no
documentation  to  show that he  paid  this debt in  March  2021  and  that it has been  resolved.
This debt became  delinquent after the date of the SCA.  (Tr. at 50-52; GE 3  at 3; GE 4  at
3; GE 5 at 3.)
s.  Charged-Off   Debt  Owed   to   Bank   -  $542.   Applicant  agrees  that   he   owes  this
debt.  The  bank  contacted  him  to  set up  a  virtual meeting  to   discuss a  resolution  of  the
debt.  That meeting  has  not yet occurred. This debt became  seriously  delinquent after the
date of the SCA. (Tr. at 52; GE  3 at 3; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 3.)
At the time he received the January 2020 SOR, Applicant was employed, though
he lost his job in August 2020. Since starting new employment in January 2021, Applicant
has  begun  to  address  his  past-due  debts,  as  shown  by  his  efforts to  resolve  debt  1.r,
discussed above. He testified that he is doing his best to make sure that his past financial
problems are not repeated. Applicant is current on his rent, car loan, utilities, and child-
support.  He  earns  a  significant  hourly  wage  in  his  new  position.  He met  with  a  credit-
repair counselor  earlier this year. In his post-hearing submission,  AE A, he provided a
copy of her engagement contract, dated March 23, 2021. Applicant provided no additional
documentation evidencing steps he has taken with the assistance of his counselor. Also
AE A makes no mention of the counselor helping Applicant prepare and file his past-due
tax returns. (Tr. at 17, 21, 62-66; AE A.)
2.  Under  Guideline   E,  the   SOR   sets  forth   one   allegation.  The   details   of   this
allegation, the underlying facts,  and Applicant’s response  are set forth below.
a. The  SOR  alleges that Applicant failed  to  disclose  in  his response  to  Section  26
of  the  SCA  that he  had  defaulted  on  any  loans in  the  last seven  years; that he  had  bills
turned  over to  collection  agencies during  the  same  period; that he  had  any  accounts  or
credit cards suspended, charged  off,  or cancelled during  that period; or that he had  been
over  120   days  delinquent  on   any   debts.   The   SOR   references  the   allegations   in
subparagraphs 1.c through  1.n.
This allegation requires the Government to establish that Applicant was aware of
each of these debts in July 2019 when he signed the SCA. With that as a predicate, the
Government must establish by substantial evidence its allegation that the omission of the
information about the debts was deliberate. The Government presented no evidence that
Applicant  was  aware  of  the debts  alleged in  1.e through 1.k,  prior  to his receipt  of  the
SOR. Applicant also testified that he disputes the debts alleged in 1.c, 1.d, 1.l, and 1.m.
The question cited in the SOR does not require the disclosure of debts that an applicant
considers to be erroneous.
The  Government  has  established,  however,  that  prior  to  the  date  of  the  SCA
Applicant  was  aware of  his delinquent car loan  alleged in subparagraph 1.n. Applicant
testified  that  he  only  disputes  the  amount  owed.  He  said  he  did  not  think  he  had  to
disclose the repossession because it was not recent. The repossession occurred in about
the end of 2014, less than five years before his SCA. (Tr. at 42-45, 56-58.)
Applicant testified  that as a  first-time  applicant for a  security  clearance, he  did  not
realize   that  his  credit   was  under  review.  He   just  was  trying   “to   get  [his]  paperwork
processed.” He  also  believed  that his debts were  not a  current concern  because  he  was
about to  start working  again  and  could  clear up  his past debts.  He  said that he  has worked
in highly sensitive areas like airports and his credit was never a consideration. (Tr. at 30-
31; 52-58.)
