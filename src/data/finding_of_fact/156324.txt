Applicant  is  a  43-year-old  procurement  analyst,  employed  by  a  government
contractor since January 2012. He earned four master’s degrees in 2011, 2012 (2), and
2013. He married in 2010 and has two children.
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant is delinquent on seven debts
totaling about $84,000. The largest debts are a mortgage judgment on a rental property
and a home equity line of credit (HELOC), totaling about $77,000. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.f).
The  remaining debts  include a  municipal government  lien (SOR  ¶ 1.b), and  consumer
collection  accounts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c  –  1.e,  and  1.g).  Applicant  admitted  to  all  of  the  SOR
debts with explanations.
Applicant  and  his spouse  purchased  a  home  in  2013  while  maintaining another
home  that  they  operated  as  a  rental  property.  While  under  pressure  to  maintain  two
mortgages and  family expenses, they began  to  accumulate  debts.  In  2018, Applicant’s
spouse  lost  income  due  to  reduced  work  hours  and  they  lost  a  tenant  in  their  rental
property.  These  events  caused  substantial  financial  difficulties.  In  2019,  several  credit
cards became delinquent and  some judgments were entered against Applicant. During
the COVID-19 pandemic, Applicant’s spouse lost several months of work while her school
was closed, resulting in a short-term loss of household income.
Applicant  began  addressing  his  debts  through  negotiations  with  his  creditors  in
2019. The largest debt, a mortgage judgment (SOR ¶ 1.a), was restructured with the new
lender, and Applicant made regular monthly payments under the plan. By March 2021,
Applicant had completed the modification plan and is now current on the mortgage with
no late payments. This debt is resolved.
SOR debts ¶ 1.b is a judgment that was satisfied in November 2020; SOR ¶ 1.c
was satisfied in August 2020; SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.f and 1.g are expected to be paid by April
to  June  2021.  Applicant  has  been  working  with  the  creditors,  but  due  to  his  spouse’s
short-term loss of income due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he has not completed resolving
these  debts.  These  debts  are  satisfied  or  are  in  proceeding  toward  a  satisfactory
resolution.
Applicant  noted  the  lessons  learned  from  being  financially  overextended  and  is
now in  a  better financial position.  He reduced  his  household spending and  recognizes
that if he is unable to maintain a tenant in his rental property, he will have to sell it.
