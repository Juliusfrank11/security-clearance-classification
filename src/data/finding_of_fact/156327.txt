Applicant  is  57  years  old.  He  was  married  to  his  first  wife  from  1988  until  they
divorced  in  2011.  They  have  a  30-year-old  son  and  21-year-old  daughter.  In  2013,
Applicant  married  his second  wife, and she has  two  sons. He  has worked  for defense
contractors for almost forty years, including his current employer since November 2000.
He  is  currently  a  design  engineer  principle.  This  is  his  second  security  clearance
application; he previously applied for and received a clearance in May 2001. (Item 2; Item
3)
Applicant admitted all the debts alleged in the SOR, except for SOR ¶¶ 1.b (paid
and  removed  from  credit  bureau  report  (CBR);  1.i  and  1.j  (disputes);  and  1.m  and  1.n
(resolved). The alleged debts total $114,000 and became delinquent between 2016 and
2018. (Items 1 – 6)
According to Applicant, his financial issues started in approximately 2011, during
his divorce. He was ordered to pay his ex-wife monthly alimony of $1,500 and $686 for
his daughter’s child support. As of the date of the SOR, Applicant was being garnished
for  an  alimony  arrearage  of  $11,400,  as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.q.  The  record  does  not
indicate how or when he fell behind on his alimony payments. (Item 1; Item 2 at 35; Item
3 at 4)
Applicant also attributes his financial issues to additional garnishments that were
the  result  of  judgments  filed  against him for failing to  pay other debts.  He opened  two
separate  consolidation  loans  in  an  attempt  to  resolve  his  issues,  but  they  resulted  in
further financial hardship. His current wife quit her job to care for her father, which also
contributed to their financial problems. The record does not reflect when this occurred.
Additionally, Applicant was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2017, which resulted in a
costly operation and treatment, and his wife was in a serious car accident in 2019, which
required three surgeries. Finally, Applicant blames his financial predicament on a lack of
communication with his current wife; her failure to properly manage their finances after
she started a crafting business in 2016; and her excessive use of credit and opening of
accounts in his name. (Item 1; Item 2; Item 3)
Applicant admitted to the following debts: SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and
1.h. They remain unpaid and outstanding. (Items 1 –   6)
Applicant asserted in his answer to the SOR that he paid and resolved the credit
card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b, and it no longer appeared on his Transunion CBR. He
failed to provide proof of resolution as well as a copy of the Transunion CBR. This debt
appeared in his November 2018 CBR as a $16,373 account placed for collection in
approximately June 2016. The debt had increased to $17,931 in his September 2019 CBR. The
debt does not appear in his most recent CBR of December 9, 2020.
According to Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he disputed SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j. He
did  not  provide  proof  of  his  efforts  to  dispute  these  debts  with  the  creditors  or  credit
reporting agencies. SOR ¶ 1.i does not appear in his December 9, 2020 CBR; however,
SOR ¶ 1.j, a cable provider, continues to appear as a delinquent debt. (Item 6)
Applicant co-signed two student loans for his son alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.n and 1.o.
The  accounts  were  opened  in  February  and  September  2011  respectively.  Applicant
claims he made payments for an unspecified period, but both debts were charged off in
July 2017.
Applicant  provided  no  proof  of  payments  toward  any of  the alleged debts  in his
answer to  the  SOR,  but  he  provided  what  appear to  be  two  pages  of  an  undated  and
incomplete  credit  bureau  report.  These  documents  that  reflect  that  SOR  ¶  1.m  was
resolved in July 2019, after Applicant settled the charged off account for less than the full
balance  of  $4,166. The  record  does  not  reflect  the amount  paid  by Applicant.  (Item  1;
Item 3 at 3; Item 6)
The SOR alleged that Applicant had a $13,164 charged-off debt that was satisfied
through  a  wage  garnishment  in  2019.  Although  the  language  within  the  allegation
indicates that the debt was resolved prior to the issuance of the SOR, Applicant provided
proof that SOR ¶ 1.r was resolved in January 2019. (Item 1)
The SOR alleged that Applicant has three delinquent medical debts totaling $197
(SOR ¶¶ 1.k, 1.l, and 1.p). There is no indication in the record that Applicant had additional
medical bills that he consolidated or he used his credit cards to pay medical bills. Rather,
he attributes his credit card debt to his wife’s excessive spending. (Items 1-6)
There is no evidence in the record that Applicant has received financial counseling
or follows a written budget. Nor is there evidence of his income and ability to live within
his means. His December 9, 2020 CBR indicates he has a new unalleged medical debt
of  $57.  According  to  Appellant,  his  intent  is  to  resolve  his  delinquent  debts  through
garnishments. He also indicted in his answer to the SOR that he intended to pay several
of  the  allegations  within  a  month  or  in  the  near  future;  however,  he  did  not  submit  a
response to the FORM with proof of any payments or resolution. (Item 1; Item 6)
