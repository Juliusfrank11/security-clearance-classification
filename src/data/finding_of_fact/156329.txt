The  SOR alleges under Guideline  F that, as of  September 1, 2020, Applicant owed
eight collection  debts (SOR ¶  1.a  - $9,089; SOR ¶  1.d  - $1,812; SOR ¶  1.e  - $980; SOR ¶
1.f  - $567; SOR ¶  1.g  - $1,758; SOR ¶  1.h  - $1,504: SOR ¶  1.i - $993; and  SOR ¶  1.j -
$567); two   charged-off   debts  (SOR  ¶   1.b   -  $5,172   and   SOR  ¶  1.c  - $4,830);  and  four
medical debts (SOR ¶  1.k - $2,104; SOR ¶  1.l - $1,036; SOR ¶  1.m  - $1,100; and  SOR ¶
1.n  - $156). Under Guideline  E, Applicant is alleged  to  have  been  arrested  in July  2000  for
shoplifting  (SOR ¶  2.a); in October 2000 for illegal possession of alcohol (SOR ¶ 2.b); in
July  2001  for felony  theft/receipt  of  stolen  property  (SOR  ¶  2.c);  in  September  2009  (SOR  ¶
2.d) and  January  2011  for driving  under the  influence  (DUI) (SOR ¶  2.g); in November
2010  (SOR ¶  2.e), December 2010  (SOR ¶  2.f), and January  2011  (SOR ¶  2.g) for driving
with  a  suspended  license; and  in February  2011  (SOR ¶  2.h) and  September  2011  (SOR  ¶
1.i) for probation  violation. Additionally  alleged  under Guideline  E, Applicant was given  an
Other Than  Honorable discharge  from  the  Navy  in December 2005  after receiving  non-
judicial punishment for failure to  obey  a  lawful order and  for wrongful use/possession  of
codeine   (SOR  ¶   2.j).  He  is  alleged   to   have   falsified   a   March  6,  2019   Electronic
Questionnaire  for  Investigations  Processing  (e-QIP)  (security  clearance  application  or  SCA)
by  denying  that he  had  ever been  charged  with  an  offense  involving  alcohol or  drugs  (SOR
¶  2.k) and  by  denying  that he  had  ever been  illegally  involved  with  a  drug  or controlled
substance while possessing a security clearance (SOR ¶ 2.l).  (Item 1.)
When   he   responded   to   the   SOR,  Applicant  admitted   the   debts  without  any
explanation  other than  that he  was making  scheduled  payments on  his student  loan  debts.
He denied  SOR allegations ¶  2.a, stating  he  had  no  recollection  of  the  event,  and  ¶  2.b,
stating  that he  was not arrested  but instead  was fined.  He  admitted  the  incidents  in  SOR  ¶¶
2.c-2.j, but explained  that the  drug  use  that led  to  his administrative  separation  from  the
Navy  was “a Japanese  cold medicine, while  stationed  in Japan.”  He  denied  any  knowledge
that codeine  was an  ingredient  in the  medicine  and  denied  abusing  it. While  he  responded
“I  admit”  to   the   alleged   falsifications  of   his  SCA,   he   denied   any   intent  to   falsify   and
reiterated that he took the drug in Japan as prescribed. (Item 1.)
After  considering   the   pleadings  and   Government  exhibits,   I  make   the   following
findings of fact:
Applicant is  38 years old. He has been  married  since  February  2015. (Item  2.) He
has a  15-year-old stepson, a  10-year-old daughter, and  a  6-year-old son. Applicant has
worked  for his current employer, a  defense  contractor, since  April 2018. (Item  3.) He is a
technical support associate. (Item 2.)
Applicant graduated  from  high  school in May  2000. (Item  3.) He  apparently  enrolled
in college  in June  2000, as he  obtained  student loans of  $1,872  and  $753  at that time.
(Items 4-6.)
In   approximately   October  2000,  Applicant   was  involved   in  a   car  accident.
Responding  police  found  a  bottle of  vodka  in his vehicle. He denies that he  consumed  any
alcohol before the  incident,  and  there is no  evidence  to  the  contrary. However, he  was
fined  $295  in April 2001  for illegal possession  of  alcohol by  a  minor  (SOR ¶  2.b). (Item  3.)
On  July  27, 2001, Applicant was charged  with  the  felony  offense  of  receiving  stolen
property/theft  (SOR ¶  2.c). On  October 18, 2001, he  pleaded  guilty  to  a  misdemeanor
charge  of  conversion  and  entered  a  pretrial diversion  program. The  charge  was dismissed
on December 5, 2001, in return for him enlisting in the  U.S. Navy. (Items 3, 8.) Applicant
entered on active duty in December 2001. Following a background investigation that was
closed in approximately August 2002, he was granted eligibility for access to SCI. (Item 2.)
In September 2005, an empty bottle of a Japanese cough suppressant containing a
Schedule II controlled substance (dihydrocodeine), a sealed box labeled with the drug
name, and some other items were found in Applicant’s room during a barracks inspection.
Applicant admitted that he had ingested five tablets of the drug the previous evening. He
was brought before a Captain’s Mast for failure to obey an order or regulation, in violation
of Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), and for wrongful use and
possession of a controlled substance, in violation of Article 112a of the UCMJ (SOR ¶ 2.j).
(Item 7.) He was placed on limited duty and his access to SCI was revoked (Items 2-3.)
During his May 2019 PSI, Applicant explained that he became ill while stationed in Japan;
that the woman he was dating had purchased the drug for him, and that he had forgotten
that he was prohibited from purchasing any drugs from Japanese pharmacies. (Item 3.) In
December 2005, Applicant was given an Other Than Honorable discharge. (Items 2-3.)
On September 27, 2009, Applicant was arrested for DUI (SOR ¶ 2.d). During his
March 2019 PSI, Applicant stated that he had consumed only two drinks on that occasion,
but also that on his arrest, his blood alcohol level tested at .18%, which suggests he may
have consumed more alcohol than he has stated. On October 26, 2009, he pled guilty and
was fined $1,951 and placed on two years of probation. (Items 3, 9.)
On November 2, 2010, Applicant was arrested for DUI after drinking “a few drinks”
at a bar with some friends. He pled guilty and was sentenced to a diversion program. His
probation for his previous DUI was extended  (SOR ¶ 2.e). (Items 3, 9.) The offense is
inexplicably  alleged  in  the  SOR  as  driving  on  a  suspended  license,  even  though  the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) (Item 9) and Applicant (Item 3) indicate it was a DUI
offense.
On  December  23,  2010,  Applicant  was  caught  driving  while  his  license  was
suspended (SOR ¶ 2.f). He was released at the scene and allowed to return home. (Item
1.)
On January 10, 2011, Applicant was arrested for DUI; criminal driving-driving while
license suspended; and misdemeanor recklessly endangering (SOR ¶ 2.g). On March 30,
2011, he was convicted of the DUI and criminal driving-driving on a suspended license. For
the DUI, he was sentenced to ten days in jail, a $2,618 fine, and 48 months of probation.
For  driving  while  his  license  was  suspended,  he  was  fined  $1,286  and  placed  on  48
months of probation. The recklessly endangering charge was dismissed. (Items 3, 9.)
On February 3, 2011, Applicant was arrested for probation violation and criminal
driving-driving on a suspended license (SOR ¶ 2.h). (Items 1, 9.) Available information
does not reflect the disposition of the charge.
On  September 21, 2011, Applicant was arrested  for failure to  appear, 2nd  degree
misdemeanor; probation  violation; and  criminal driving-driving  on  a  suspended  or revoked
license (SOR ¶ 2.i). The prosecution elected not to file a complaint for failure to appear.
Applicant  was  convicted  of  misdemeanor  probation  violation  and  criminal  driving.  His
probation was extended to October 2013 for the probation violation. He was sentenced on
the criminal driving charge to 15 days in jail, a $2,409 fine, and 36 months of probation.
(Item 9.)
On March 6, 2019, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an SCA on
which he responded negatively to inquiries concerning whether he had ever been charged
with an offense involving alcohol or drugs (SOR ¶ 2.k) and whether he had been involved
illegally with a drug or controlled substance while holding a security clearance (SOR ¶ 2.l).
(Item 2.) At the time, Applicant did not recall his underage alcohol possession offense that
occurred in October 2000. He apparently recalled the September 2009 and January 2011
DUI arrests (the November 2010 DUI was  not alleged), but he asserts that he had no
intention  to  falsify  his  SCA.  Regarding  his  use  of  an  illegal  drug  in  September  2005,
Applicant admits that he had taken a Japanese cough medicine, but denies that he took it
other than as prescribed. (Item 1.) He reported on his March 6, 2019 SCA that his SCI
access  eligibility  was  cancelled  in  September  2005  after  he  received  non-judicial
punishment. (Item 2.) He did not elaborate on his SCA about the reason for his Captain’s
Mast and Other Than Honorable discharge from the military.
During his May 2, 2019 PSI, Applicant provided details about his use of codeine in
September  2005,  which  led  to  his  non-judicial  punishment  and  military  discharge.  He
responded “Yes” when asked whether he had ever been arrested for an offense involving
alcohol  or  drugs  and  volunteered  that  he  had  been  arrested  for DUI  in  October 2009,
November 2010, and January 2011. (Item 3.) There is no indication that he was asked by
the  OPM  investigator  to  explain  his  SCA  denial  of  any  alcohol-related  charges  on  his
record.
Finances
There is no information in evidence about Applicant’s employments, if any, after his
military discharge in December 2005 until April 2009, when he began working in customer
support for a cable and Internet services provider. After one year, Applicant then worked as
an assembler in the semiconductor industry from May 2010 to February 2012.  He was
unemployed from February 2012 until April 2013. He then worked as a technician for about
a year. From April 2014 to April 2017, he was employed as a production assembler. He
then  worked  from  May  2017  to  April  2018  as  a  production  technician  for  yet  another
employer  outside  the  defense  industry.  (Item  3.)  The  evidentiary  record  contains  no
information about his income from these employments.
On his March 6, 2019 SCA completed for his current employer, Applicant listed a
$980 cell phone delinquency (SOR ¶ 1.e) that he was disputing; a $9,089 vehicle loan debt
in collection that he cannot afford to repay (SOR ¶ 1.a); and past-due medical debts of
$2,104 (SOR ¶ 1.k) and $1,036 (SOR ¶ 1.l) that he was disputing. (Item 2.) A check of
Applicant’s credit on March 19, 2019, revealed additional delinquencies, including student
loan debts. Salient details about Applicant’s past-due accounts include the following:
Collection debt of  $9,089  (SOR ¶ 1.a)
Applicant and a joint borrower obtained an automobile loan of $22,791 in January
2014. They stopped paying on the loan in March 2015, and the account was transferred for
collection in October 2017. In November 2017, the original lender charged off his account
for $11,999. In March 2019, the collection entity reported a past-due balance of $9,089 on
the account. (Item 4.)  Applicant acknowledged owing the debt during his May 2019 PSI
and expressed an intention to establish a repayment plan for the debt in 2019. (Item 3.)
The debt remains unresolved (Items 1, 5-6.) He presented no evidence of any efforts to
pay the debt.
Charged-off debt of $5,172  (SOR ¶ 1.b)
In September 2012, Applicant and a joint borrower obtained an automobile loan of
$11,236. They stopped paying on the loan in May 2013, and the account became $5,172

(Item  4.)  Applicant  did  not  report  the  debt  on  his  March  2019  SCA  (Item  2),  but  he
acknowledged the delinquent debt during his May 2019 PSI and indicated that he planned
to set up a payment plan in 2019. (Item 3.) As of November 2019, the past-due balance
was reportedly $5,172. (Item 5.) The debt had been removed from his credit record by
October 2020 (Item 6), but there is no evidence that it had been resolved.

Applicant signed on as co-maker on an installment sales contract opened in January
2011 that had a high credit of $12,659. The repayment term was $435 per month for 54
months. In October 2012, the account was charged off for $4,830. (Item 4.) Applicant did
not report the debt on his March 2019 SCA (Item 2), but he acknowledged the debt during
his May 2019 PSI and indicated that he would establish a payment plan in 2019. (Item 3.)
The debt had been removed from his credit record by January 2020 (Item 5), but there is
no evidence that it had been resolved.

Applicant opened  a  cell-phone  account  in  2010  or  2011.  (Item  3.)  In  October  2014,  a
cell-phone service provider placed a $980 debt for collection. The  debt was unpaid as of
March  2019.   (Item   4.)  Applicant  listed   the   debt  on   his  March  2019   SCA  as  an   open
financial  issue   that  was  incurred   because   he   could  not  make   his  payments.   He
unsuccessfully  disputed  the  debt.  (Items 2-3.) He acknowledged  owing  the  debt during  his
May 2019 PSI and expressed an intention to establish a payment plan in 2019 to resolve
the debt. (Item 3.) The debt was not reported on Applicant’s credit record as of January
2020 (Item 5) and October 2020 (Item 6), but there is no evidence it had been resolved.
Collection debt of $567 (SOR ¶ 1.f)
In September 2014, a cable and Internet services provider placed a $567 debt for
collection. As of February 2019, the debt was reported on his credit record as unpaid. (Item
4.) Applicant denied the debt when confronted about it during his May 2019 SCA. (Item 3.)
The debt was not reported on Applicant’s credit record as of January 2020 (Item 5) and
October 2020 (Item 6), but there is no evidence it had been resolved.
Student loan collection debt of $1,758 (SOR ¶ 1.g)
Applicant’s credit reports list a student loan of $3,000 acquired in November 2015.
The loan was $1,745 past due as of October 2016 and in collection as of January 2018.
(Items 4-5.) Applicant did not list any student loan delinquency on his March 2019 SCA.
(Item  2.)  As  of  March  2019,  the  loan  was  in  collection  for  $3,431.  (Item  4.)  When
confronted about the debt during his May 2019 SCA, Applicant stated that he opened the
account  “when  he  attended  college  in  2001.”  He  added  that  the  account  was  closed
because the Federal government took his income tax refund in 2019 to pay it off. (Item 3.)
Applicant did not present any Federal tax records, such as an Internal Revenue Service
(IRS)  tax  transcript  or  letter  from  the  IRS,  to  show  the  disposition  of  his  tax  refund.
However,  in  September  2020,  Equifax  reported  the  loan  as  current  with  a  balance  of
$1,758. (Item 6.)
Student loan collection debt of  $1,504 (SOR ¶ 1.h)
Applicant obtained a student loan of $1,872 in June 2000. Due to inactivity on the

not list the debt on his March 2019 SCA. (Item 2.) He acknowledged the educational loan
during his May 2019 PSI but indicated that the account was closed because the Federal
government took his tax refund in 2019 to resolve the debt. (Item 3.)  Applicant did not
present IRS tax documentation showing application of his refund to this account. The loan
had a past-due balance of $1,495 in December 2019. (Item 5.) As of September 2020, the

Applicant did not list the debt on his March 2019 SCA. (Item 2.) During his May 2019 PSI,
he  stated  that  he  obtained  the  loan  for  college  in  2001,  and  he  did  not  know when  it

closed as the Federal government had taken his income tax refund in 2019 to resolve the

asserted that the account was closed as the Federal government had taken his income tax
refund in 2019 to resolve the debt. (Item 3.) He presented no tax documentation showing
that any of his income tax refund had been applied to this debt. As of September 2020, the
account had a past-due balance of $567. (Item 6.)

Applicant  listed  the  debt  from  emergency  room  care  in  September 2018  on  his
March  2019  SCA.  He  indicated  that  it  was  an  open  financial  issue  that  was  incurred
because he could not make payments. He reported that he was disputing the debt (Item 2),
but he provided no corroborating documentation of any contacts with the credit reporting
agencies  or creditor. The  debt  was  listed  on  Applicant’s  credit record with  a  collection
balance of $2,104 as of February 2019. (Item 4.) Applicant acknowledged owing the debt
during his May 2019 PSI and expressed an intention to establish a repayment plan for the
debt  in  2019.  (Item  3.)  The  debt  was  not  reported  on  Applicant’s  credit  record  as  of
January 2020 (Item 5) and October 2020 (Item 6), but there is no evidence it has  been

Medical collection debt of $1,036 (SOR ¶ 1.l)
Applicant listed the debt from emergency room care in February 2018 on his March
2019 SCA. He indicated that it was an open financial issue that was incurred because he
could not make payments. He reported that he was disputing the debt (Item 2), but he
provided no corroborating documentation of any contacts with the credit reporting agencies
or creditor. The debt was listed on Applicant’s credit record with a collection balance of
$1,036  as of  February 2019. (Item  4.) The  debt was not reported  on  Applicant’s credit
record as of January 2020 (Item 5) and October 2020 (Item 6), but there is no evidence it
has been resolved.
Medical collection debt of $1,100 (SOR ¶ 1.m)
The SOR alleges a medical collection debt of $1,100. Applicant admitted the debt
without explanation in response to the SOR. (Item 1.) However, none of the evidentiary
documents in evidence substantiate the debt.
Medical collection debt of $156 (SOR ¶ 1.n)
Applicant’s credit reports list a  $156  medical debt from  January 2018 placed for
collection in April 2018. (Items 4-6.) Applicant did not report the debt on his March 2019
SCA. (Item 2.) He disputed the debt when confronted about it during his May 2019 PSI.
(Item 3.) The debt was reported by Equifax as unpaid as of September 2020. (Item 6.)
During his May 2, 2019 PSI, Applicant stated that he previously viewed his credit as
“out of sight, out of mind,” and that he did not realize its importance in his life. He admitted
that he had held an immature attitude about his credit. He explained that he was the sole
income source for his household as his spouse had to care for their autistic child and two
other children. He gave priority to necessities such as rent and utilities over other debts.
Applicant asserted that he was living within his means and paying his debts, and that his
present income should allow him to repay his past delinquencies and avoid new financial
problems. He described his overall financial situation as stable. The OPM investigator gave
Applicant the opportunity at and after his PSI to provide additional documentation about his
delinquent debts, and he failed to do so. (Item 3.)
The  DCSA  CAF  issued  an  SOR  to  Applicant  on  September  1,  2020,  partially
because of the aforesaid delinquencies. All but one of them (SOR ¶ 1.m) were included on
one or more of his credit reports. In response, Applicant admitted each of the debts, but
indicated that he was “making scheduled payments” on the four student loans alleged in
the  SOR.  He  provided  no  documentation  of  those  payments.  His  October  2020  credit
report (Item 6) showed a substantial reduction in the balances owed on the student loans
in  SOR  ¶¶  1.g  and  1.i,  although  it  is  unclear  to  what  extent  the  reduction  is  due  to
payments  by  Applicant  and/or  interception  and  application  of  his income  tax refund  in
2019.
There is no evidence in the record that Applicant filed a response to the FORM.
Applicant presented no details about his income or expenses. There is no evidence that he
has had any financial or budget counseling.
