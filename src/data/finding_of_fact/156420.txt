Applicant  is  42  years  old.  In  2006,  he  married  his  wife,  and  they  separated  in
December 2013. They have a 12-year-old  son. Applicant  has  worked for his employer
since 2012, where he is currently a director. He earned a master’s degree in 2006. His
employer has requested that Applicant be issued a DOD security clearance in order  to
enable him to perform specific employment duties. (Item 2)
Applicant admitted the accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.g, and denied the
remaining debts. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.d., 1.e, and 1.f.) The total amount of indebtedness
alleged is $71,131, which includes over $21,500 in federal tax liens. (Items 1 – 7; AE A)
Applicant stated in his SOR response that he was actively working to resolve his
delinquent  accounts.  Although  the  SOR  alleged  indebtedness  totaled  $71,131,  he
claimed that he had reduced the overall amount of indebtedness to $48,760. On May 25,
2021,  I  requested  Applicant  provide  updated  documentation  to  show  his  history  of
payments and the current status of his SOR accounts. I held the record open for ten days
in  the  event  he  wanted  to  submit  this  requested  documentation.  On  June  4,  2021,
Applicant provided the requested updated information that he attached to his original SOR
response. (AE A, AE B)
According  to  Applicant,  his  financial  issues  worsened  in  approximately  2014,
following the separation from his spouse in late 2013. She had sporadic employment from
2013 to 2017, after which time she was no longer employed. Since she has earned the
same amount of income, or more, as compared to Applicant, the loss of her income during
their  separation  was  a  major  factor  contributing  to  their  financial  problems.  He  fully
supported  his  family  although  they  are  separated,  and  his  spouse  continued  to  have
access to their joint bank account. She uses his income to pay their joint accounts as well
as to fund her and their son’s living expenses. His spouse has always handled the family
finances. Applicant described his financial situation as acceptable, but disorganized. He
has never participated in financial counseling. When he submitted updated information to
the record on June 4, 2021, he reported that his spouse had been hired in early 2021 and
is currently employed. (Item 1, Item 3; AE A, AE B)
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  is  indebted  to  Midland  Funding  in  the  amount  of
$20,957,  for  an  account  placed  into  collection.  Applicant  denied  this  allegation  and
provided documentation showing that he has been making consistent monthly payments
of $290 since March 2019 to the creditor. As of April 2020, the current account balance
was $8,410. As of June 4, 2021, the outstanding balance was $6,380.  This delinquent
account is in the process of being resolved. (Item 1, Item 3, Item 4, Item 5, Item 6; AE A,
AE B)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  Applicant  is  indebted  to  Bank  of  America  for  a  charged-off
account in the amount of $7,453. He admitted this debt and intends to settle this debt, but
he  has  prioritized  other  delinquent accounts to  pay before  he  takes  any action  on  this
account. Based on the updated information provided on June 4, 2021, Applicant recently
hired an attorney to negotiate a settlement with the creditor, but a settlement resolution
has not yet been reached. This debt has not yet been resolved. (Item 1; AE A, AE B)
SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e allege student loan accounts placed for collection with
ECMC in the total amount of $21,144. Applicant admitted he owed these debts but denied
the SOR allegations since he was in the process of consolidating the three student loans
into a single loan through FedLoan Servicing. If the consolidation is approved, it would
take the student loans out of “delinquent” status. Updated information provided on June
4, 2021, showed that the loan consolidation was approved in January 2021, and since
that time, Applicant has made consistent monthly payments of $240.88. There is sufficient
evidence to show that the student loans are currently in the process of being resolved.
(Item 1, Item 4, Item 5; AE A, AE B)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges Applicant is indebted to the Federal government in the amount
of $9,824 after a tax lien was entered against him in 2014. He denied this tax debt and
provided documentation with his SOR response that the 2011 tax debt had been resolved
and the tax lien released in October 2020. (Item 1, AE A)
SOR  ¶  1.g alleges  a  2019  Federal tax lien  in  the  amount of  $11,753. Applicant
admitted this Federal tax debt and stated in his SOR response that he was in the process
of  working  with  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  to  resolve  this  debt.  On  June  4,  2021,
Applicant provided updated information to show that the tax debt has been paid and the
tax lien was released in April 2021. (Item 1; AE B)
