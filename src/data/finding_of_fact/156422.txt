In   his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted   (with   clarifications)   the   financial
allegations  in ¶¶  1.a  through  1.e  (owing  the  IRS  $23,387  for TY  2014; $27,308  for TY
2015; $28,172  for TY 2016; and  $23,195  for TY 2017);  and 1.g  (failing to timely file state
“3” income  tax  returns for TYs 2015  through  2018).  He  denied  the  SOR allegation  in ¶
1.f   (failing   to   timely   file   state   “1”  income   tax   returns  for  TYs  2012   through   2017).  His
SOR  admissions   and   those   at  his   hearing   are   incorporated   herein   as  findings   of   fact.
After a  thorough  review  of  the  record evidence,  I make  the  following  additional findings
of  fact:
Applicant is 69 years old. He graduated from high school in 1970, and enlisted in
the  U.S.  Air  Force  in  1971,  where  he  honorably  served  until  he  retired  as  a  master
sergeant  (E-7)  in  1993.  He  held  a  secret  clearance  during  most  of  his  time  in  the
service.  He  was  awarded,  among  others,  the  Meritorious  Service  Medal  (3),  the  Air
Force Commendation Medal with 1 Bronze Star, the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award
(3), the Good Conduct Medal (7), and the National Defense Service Medal (2). (AE N)
The  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  rated  Applicant  90  percent  disabled  due  to
service  connected  injuries.  He  receives  close  to  $2,000  a  month  in  VA  disability
compensation. (Tr. 73-74; AE V, pg. 4)
Applicant married in 1976 and divorced in 1996. He married his wife in 1997, and
he has eight adult children and 18 grandchildren. Applicant’s wife testified on his behalf.
She  stated  that  because  of  his  military  service  and  many  family  separations,  she  has
been in charge of the family finances and the filing of their income tax returns for many
years. Applicant received two associate’s degrees from a service community college in
1993, and completed his bachelor’s degree in computer science in 1998.
After his retirement from the service, Applicant  worked for state  “1” government
between 1993 and 2008, except for the following periods: he was unemployed between
June 2001 and November 2001; he worked as a gas station clerk between  December
2001  and  August  2002;  and  worked  as  a  store  department  manager  between  June
2002 and April 2003.
In May 2008, Applicant moved to state “2,” and worked there as an independent
contractor  for  a  federal  contractor  providing  support  to  federal  agencies.  In  2011,  his
contract  ended  and  he  moved  to  state  “3”  in  2012,  to  continue  his  work  as  an
independent  contractor  for  federal  contractors.  (Tr.  55)  Between  2008  and  2018,  he
held  secret  and  top-secret  clearances  working  for  federal  contractors.  He  started
working  for  his  current  employer  and  clearance  sponsor,  a  federal  contractor,  in
February 2021. He makes $115,000 a year, plus a $5,000 bonus from his employer.
In response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his August 2018 SCA, Applicant
stated that he was working with a tax specialist to prepare delinquent federal and state
income  tax  returns for tax  years  2014,  2015,  2016,  and  2017.  He  claimed  his  filing  of
those  income  tax  returns  were  delayed  for  many  different  reasons:  in  2014,  he  had  a
loss of income from his rental property in state “2” and was forced to sell the property at
a  loss;  in  2015,  he  was  laid  off,  and  had  income  complications  due  to  unemployment
compensation, filing for social security, and a new job with a significant loss in income;
he lost income from  a  rental property in state  “1”; he had expensive repairs to a rental
property; he had rental management expenses from May 2016 to September 2017 for a
property in state “1”; several family members passed away; he and his wife were living
apart due to jobs or family issues; and he and his wife had many medical problems.
During  his  January  2019  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  interview,
Applicant  said  his  goal  was  to  have  all  of  his  delinquent  income  tax  returns  filed  by
September  2019.  He  claimed  that,  in  all  the  years  in  question,  he  had  requested
extensions to file, and had paid his taxes via income and retirement income deductions.
He failed  to  submit documentary evidence to  show he  requested extensions to file his
income tax returns for any of  the years in question. The IRS transcripts for the TYs in
question  show  that  he  paid  part  of  the  taxes  owed  via  income  deductions.  The  IRS
transcripts do not show filing extensions were requested.
Applicant and his wife testified that she was in charge of the family finances and
the filing of the income tax returns. They confirmed that they had filed their income tax
returns late for tax years 2014 through 2017. They indicated they had been through at
least six tax preparers between 2014 and 2020. (AE W-1)
The  IRS  Transcript  for  TY  2013  (dated  February  19,  2020),  indicates  Applicant
filed his 2013 income tax return on October 19, 2015. His filing status was married filing
joint, and he was issued a $967 refund. (Answer to the SOR, Attachment C)
The IRS Transcript for TY 2014  (dated May 18, 2021), indicates the IRS filed a
substitute  tax  return  for  Applicant  (married  filing  separate  status)  on  July  22,  2019.
According  to  the  TY  2014  IRS  transcript,  Applicant’s  balance  owed  plus  accruals  was
$23,213, as of May 31, 2021. (AE W-2)
The IRS Transcript for TY 2015 (dated May 18, 2021), indicates the IRS filed a
substitute  tax  return  for  Applicant  (married  filing  separate  status)  on  July  1,  2019.
According  to  the  TY  2015  IRS  Transcript,  Applicant’s balance owed plus accruals was
$27,289, as of May 31, 2021. (AE W-2)
Applicant’s federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2014 through 2016, were
completed  by  a  commercial  tax  preparer  and  mailed  to  the  IRS  on  July  15,  2020.  At
hearing, Applicant claimed that based on those income tax returns, he was due a $916
refund  for  TY  2014,  and  he  owed  the  IRS  $1,916  for  TY  2015.  He  asked  the  IRS  to
apply the $916 refund from 2014 to his 2015 debt, and he issued a $1,000 check to the
IRS to pay his 2015 tax debt. The check was cashed by the IRS. (Likely, there would be
no refund because he filed more than three years late.) (AE U(1.b))
The IRS Transcript for TY 2016 (dated May 18, 2021), indicates the IRS filed a
substitute tax return for Applicant (with a married filing separate status) on July 1, 2019.
According  to  the  TY  2016  IRS  Transcript,  Applicant’s  balance  owed plus accruals was
$25,760, as of May 31, 2021. (AE W-2)
Based on  his income tax return for TY 2016,  Applicant owed  the  IRS  $3,980  in
back  taxes.  He  issued  a  check  for  $3,980,  and  attached  it  to  Form  1040-V  2016
Payment  Voucher,  when  he  filed  the  2016  income  tax  return  on  July  15,  2020.  He
indicated in his return that he was entitled to a $1,535 refund from his state. (AE U(1.c))
The IRS Transcript for TY 2017 (dated May 18, 2021), indicates the IRS filed a
substitute tax return for Applicant (with a married filing separate status) on February 24,
2020. According to the TY 2017 IRS Transcript, Applicant’s balance owed plus accruals
was $21,445, as of May 31, 2021. (AE W-2)
Applicant’s federal and state income tax returns for TY 2017, were completed by
a  commercial  tax  preparer  and  emailed  to  the  IRS  and  state  tax  authority  on  October
28, 2020. The tax preparer sent an email to Applicant that same day indicating the IRS
and the state tax authority had accepted his 2017 income tax returns. (AE A) Based on
his tax preparer income tax return for TY 2017, Applicant owed the IRS $4,397 in back
taxes.  He  issued  a  check  for  $2,397,  and  attached  it  to  Form  1040-V  2017  Payment
Voucher,  when  he  filed  the  2017  income  tax  return  on  January  20,  2021.  He  paid  an
additional  $2,000  on  April  18,  2021.  (AE  U(1.d)).  He  received  a  $1,662  refund  for  TY
2017 from his state on November 2, 2020. (AE U(1.g))
The  IRS  Transcript  for  TY  2018  (dated  May  18,  2021),  indicates  Applicant filed
his income tax return (married filing joint status) on December 7, 2020. According to the
TY  2018  IRS  Transcript,  Applicant’s  balance  owed  plus  accruals  was  $24,827,  as  of
May 31, 2021. (AE W-2)
Applicant’s  2018  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  were  completed  by  a
commercial tax preparer on November 9, 2020, and electronically submitted to the IRS
and  state  “3”  on  that  same  date.  State  “3”  indicated  in  a  letter  to  Applicant  that  it  had
applied a 2020 refund to the tax due for TY 2018.
Based on his tax preparer income tax return for TY 2018, Applicant owed the IRS
$16,408 in back taxes. He also owed his state $2,900 for delinquent taxes. (AE U(1.e,
1.g)). The state applied the 2014 refund ($2,900) and the $2015 refund ($2,625) to the
TY 2018 deficiency. He paid the remainder, $273, by check on March 12, 2021.
Applicant’s  2019  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  were  completed  by  a
commercial tax preparer on March 24, 2021, and electronically submitted to the IRS and
state  “3”  tax  authority  on  that  same  date.  The  IRS Transcript for TY  2019  (dated  May
18, 2021), indicates Applicant did not file an income tax return. (AE W-2) Based on his
tax  preparer  income  tax  return  for  TY  2019,  Applicant  owed  the  IRS  $7,580  in  back
taxes. He was due a state refund for $1,291. (AE V, pg. 44)
Applicant’s  2020   federal  and   state   income   tax   returns  were  completed   by   a
commercial tax  preparer on May  12, 2021,  and  electronically  submitted  to  the  IRS  and
state   “3”  on   that  same   date.   Applicant  submitted   documentation   showing   that  the   IRS
and   the   state   tax   authority   accepted  his  TY  2020   income   tax   return   on   May   12, 2021.
Applicant paid  the  federal taxes owed  ($1,874) by  check on  May  17,  2021.  (AE  W,  Tab
7)  Applicant   anticipated   a   state   tax   refund   of  $3,211.  (I   note   that  the   2020   IRS
Transcript,  dated   May   18,  2021,   is  not  up-to-date   and   does  not  reflect   that  Applicant
filed his TY 2020 income  tax  return.)
Applicant submitted documentary evidence showing that he contacted the IRS on
about  September  17,  2019,  and  proposed  to  pay  $75,639,  the  balance  owed  then  for
TYs 2014 through 2016 (including applicable penalties and interest charges) by January
15,  2020.  The  IRS  accepted  the  proposed  payment  plan.  Applicant  presented  no
documentary evidence to show that he paid the $75,639, or that he made any payments
pursuant to his payment plan.
On  January  21,  2021,  Applicant  contacted  the  IRS  and  proposed  to  pay
$126,960  - the  amount  he  owed  for  delinquent  taxes  for  TYs  2014  through  2017  - by
May  21,  2021.  The  IRS  accepted  his  proposal  and  warned  him  that  the  debt  would
continue  to  accrue  interest  and  penalties  until  paid  in  full.  Applicant  presented  no
documentary  evidence  to  show  that  he  made  the  $126,960  payment,  or  made  any
payments toward his tax debt in accordance with the payment plan.
Concerning SOR ¶ 1.f (alleging Applicant’s failure to timely file income tax returns
for TYs 2012 through 2017  in state  “1”),  Applicant’s documentary evidence  shows that
the last year he filed income tax returns in state “1” was in 2011. He moved to  state “2”
in  2008.  However, his wife  stayed  in  state  “1” until 2009.  As  a non-resident,  Applicant
was required to file income tax returns in  state  “1” if he had any rental income, even if
he  had  an  overall loss  on  the  property and owed  no  taxes.  Applicant  chose  not  to file
income  tax  returns  for  state  “1”  for  TYs  2012  through  2017  because  he  had  negative
income from his rental property. He claimed that his tax preparer advised him not to file
if he would not owe any taxes.  Applicant still  owns a  property in state  “1” that is being
rented by one of his daughters.  (AE B; Tr. 45-47) Applicant’s commercial tax  preparer
opined that Applicant does not have any tax liability to states “1” and “2” after TY 2012,
because he has been a resident of state “3” since 2012. (AE U(1.f))
Concerning  SOR  ¶  1.g  (alleging  Applicant’s  failure  to  timely  file  income  tax
returns  for  TYs  2015  through  2018  in  state  “3”),  Applicant’s  documentary  evidence
shows  that  he  has  been  a  resident  of  state  “3”  since  2012.  (AE  U(1.f))  The  record
evidence shows that Applicant failed to timely file his state “3” income tax returns for TY
2012 through 2020.
Applicant  believes  that  he  has  learned  a  hard  lesson  as  a  result  of  his  tax
problems  and  the  clearance  process.  He  promised  to  timely  file  his  federal  and  state
income tax returns in the future and to expeditiously pay any owed taxes.  He believes
that his many years of valuable service to the federal government, in the Air Force and
working  for  federal  contractors,  show  he  is  not  a  security  risk.  Applicant  considers
himself to be a loyal American and a dedicated family man.
