Applicant,  age  41,  divorced  his  wife  of  7  years  in  2013.  He  has  two  minor
children.  He  has  resided  with  a  cohabitant  since  2014.  He  attended  college  for  three
months  in  2009,  but  did  not  earn  a  degree.  He  has  been  employed  by  a  defense
contractor  since  November  2019.  This  is  his  first  application  for  a  security  clearance.
(Item 3)
The  SOR  alleged  11  delinquent  debts  totaling  $33,362,  including  two  federal
student-loan  accounts totaling $15,383,  which  were  confirmed by the  credit  reports. In
his SOR answer, Applicant admitted each of the alleged debts. (Items 2, 4-10)
In November 2019, Applicant promised to start paying the debts alleged in SOR
¶¶  1.f  and  1.g  in  December  2019;  and  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.d  via  monthly
payments of at least $100 for an unspecified period until fully resolved. The record did
not reflect that any of these payments had been made. (Item 3 at 46-48)
In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  that  the  alleged  SOR  debts  remained
unresolved. He also asserted the following: 1) that he was “working toward making the
money needed to take care of all these debts;” and 2) that he wants “nothing more than
to correct [his] past shortcomings and move forward with [his] life and career within the
world of government contracting. He contended that he planned on having “most, if not
all, of these unpaid debts taken care of by years end.”
While  Applicant  did  not explain  why  he  incurred  the  SOR  debts  or why  they  have
persisted,  some   relevant  facts  were  revealed   by   the   record.  The   SOR  debts  were
reported   delinquent  between   2011   and   2019.  Since   2011,  Applicant  has   been
unemployed  three  times: 1) from  August 2011  through  March 2012  (following  a  layoff);
2)  from   April  2014   through   July   2014   (following   a   voluntary   resignation);  and   3)  from
December  2015   through   February   2016   (following   a   layoff).  In   2016,  Applicant
discovered  that  he  owed  $7,774  for a  child-support arrearage  due  to  what he  described
as  an   accounting   error  on   the   part  of   his  employer.  In   his  November  2019   SCA,   he
reported   that   the   arrearage   was  being   paid   via  a   wage   garnishment.   Between   March
2018   and   June   2020,  Applicant  opened   five   credit-card  accounts  (with   limits  between
$300  and  $1,500) and  one  automobile-loan  account  (with  a  high  credit of  $21,173). As
of   January   2021,  he   was  current  on   the   automobile-loan   account   and   four  of   the   five
credit-card accounts.  He  was at  least  two  payments  past due  on  one  of the  credit-card
accounts.   The   unalleged   child-support  arrearage   and   late   credit-card  account   will  be
considered only to evaluate mitigation and the whole-person concept. (Items 2-10)
