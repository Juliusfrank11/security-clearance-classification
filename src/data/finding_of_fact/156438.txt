In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, in part, and denied, in part, all of
the  SOR  allegations  pertaining  to  financial  considerations  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  through  1.c.).
Applicant’s  admissions  and  comments  are  incorporated  herein.  After  a  complete  and
thorough  review of  the evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon due  consideration of  same, I
make the following findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as an operations teleworker with his current sponsor since sometime after he submitted
his  SF  86  in  April  2018.  He  is  also  serving  as  an  enlisted  member  of  the  U.S.  Army
Reserve. He received a bachelor’s degree in 2010. He previously served on active duty
with the U.S. Army from March 2011 until July 2017, when he was honorably discharged
as a sergeant (E-5). During his period of active duty, he was deployed on two occasions:
to  Afghanistan  from  April  2013  until  December  2013;  and  to  South  Korea  from  March
2016 until October 2016. Upon his discharge from active duty, he continued his service
in the inactive reserve. It is unclear if he was ever granted a security clearance, for in his
SF 86 he indicated that he had undergone an investigation for a secret clearance, but did
not state that one had been awarded to him. He was married in 2014. He has two children,
born in 2016 and 2018.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can  be  found  in  the  following  exhibits:  Item  2  (SF  86,  dated  April  30,  2018);  Item  3
(Enhanced Personal Interview, dated June 14, 2018); Item 4 (Answers to Interrogatories,
dated  June  16,  2020);  Item  5  (Combined  Experian,  TransUnion,  and  Equifax  Credit
Report, dated April 16, 2019); Item 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated April 16, 2019); Item
6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated May 32, 2019); and Item 7 (Equifax Credit Report, dated
February 7, 2020).
Applicant reported that he was unemployed from May 2009 until March 2011, when
he entered active duty, as well as from July 2017, when he left active duty, until at least
April 30, 2018, while he was in the inactive reserve. It is unclear what factors led to his
financial difficulties as he did not specify any factors except that when he left active duty,
he was living on a fixed income from the reserves and his U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) disability. He stopped paying on his loans, and other than attempting to have
his student loans placed on hold, he had not made any attempts to pay them.  In June
2018,  when  he  was  interviewed  by  an  investigator  from  the  U.S.  Office  of  Personnel
Management (OPM), he characterized his finances as not currently in a good state. (Item
3, at 7) He claimed to be embarrassed by having delinquent accounts, and the degree of
embarrassment  was  such  that  he  had  not  told  his  wife  of  their  financial  situation.  He
planned  to  tell  her  “soon”  and  intended  to  seek  financial  counseling.  (Item  3,  at  8)
Applicant  did  not  subsequently  indicate  if  he  had  finally  told  his  wife  of  his  financial
situation. He also did not state that he had obtained financial counseling.
As of June 2020, when he submitted his answers to the interrogatories, Applicant
acknowledged that he had not paid, did not have any payment arrangements, and that
he was not making payments on two student loans that were in collection. A third account
was charged off. (Item 4, at 4). He added that since he had no contact information for the
creditor  holding  two  of  the  accounts,  he  was  unable  to  contact  them,  so  he  turned  to
disputing the accounts with Credit Karma. (Item 4, at 6) It should be noted that the mailing
address and telephone number of the creditor are listed in his two 2019 credit reports.
Applicant  failed  to  submit  any  documentation  to  support  his  contention  that  he  had
disputed  the  accounts,  and  he  failed  to  furnish  a  reasonable  basis  to  dispute  the
legitimacy of the two delinquent accounts.
On  March  6,  2020,  along  with  his  responses  to  the  interrogatories,  Applicant
completed  a  Personal  Financial  Statement  in  which  he  reported  $3,470  in  current  net
monthly  income,  including  his  $1,000  VA  disability  compensation;  $1,750  in  monthly
expenses;  student-loan  debts  (claimed  to  be  on  an  income-based  repayment  plan)
totaling $87,992 with a scheduled monthly payment of $1,000, but an actual payment of
zero;  leaving  a  monthly  remainder  of  $1,720  available  for  discretionary  spending  or
savings. He claimed to have $17,460 in bank savings. (Item 4). He failed to submit any
documentation to support his contention that the student-loan debts were on an income-
based repayment plan.
The SOR alleged three delinquent accounts totaling approximately $52,406, as set
forth as follows:
SOR  ¶  1.a.   is  a  student-loan  account  from  a  bank  with  an  unpaid  balance  of
$11,753 that was charged off. (Item 5, at 5) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted
that the account had been charged off, but denied that as of the date the SOR was issued,
it was still delinquent. He submitted some documents reflecting that the unpaid balance
had decreased to approximately $8,902; that an offer of settlement had been made by
the  creditor  willing  to  accept  approximately  $1,335;  and  an  approved  payment  in  that
amount was made on September 21, 2020. (Documents attached to Answer to the SOR).
The account has been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b. is a federal student-loan account with an unpaid balance of $17,801
that was placed for collection and transferred. (Item 5, at 5; Item 6, at 2; Item 7, at 7). In
his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  that  the  account  had  been  delinquent,  but
denied that as of the date the SOR was issued, it was still delinquent. He submitted some
documents reflecting that he had been sued on July 21, 2020, for approximately $20,852,
including accrued interest; Applicant paid $18,700 on August 28, 2020; and that the suit
was dismissed with prejudice on September 3, 2020. (Documents attached to Answer to
the SOR). The account has been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c.  is a federal student-loan account with an unpaid balance of $22,852
that was placed for collection and transferred. (Item 5, at 5; Item 6, at 2; Item 7, at 7). In
his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  that  the  account  had  been  delinquent,  but
denied that as of the date the SOR was issued, it was still delinquent. He submitted some
documents reflecting that he had been sued on July 21, 2020, for approximately $26,332,
including accrued interest; Applicant paid the $18,700 noted above; and that the suit was
dismissed with prejudice on September 10, 2020. (Documents attached to Answer to the
SOR). The account has been resolved.
It  is  noted  that  despite  Applicant’s  claimed  inability  to  maintain  the  accounts
alleged in the SOR in a current status because of insufficient funds to do so, or a choice
not to do so, his March 2020 Personal Financial Statement reported a monthly remainder
of  $1,720  available  for  discretionary  spending  or  savings.  And,  he  claimed  to  have
$17,460 in bank savings.  He  offered no explanation  regarding the source of  the funds
used to resolve the three SOR-alleged delinquent debts.
Furthermore, there is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or a current
Personal  Financial  Statement.  Accordingly,  it  is  difficult  to  determine  if  Applicant  is
currently in a better position financially than he had been.
