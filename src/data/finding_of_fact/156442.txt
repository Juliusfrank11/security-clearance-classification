Applicant is a  51-year-old single man  with  one  child, age  ten. He has been  married
twice,   and   both   marriages  ended   in  divorce.   Applicant  is  a   veteran   of   the   U.S.  Army,
serving  honorably  from  1987  to  his retirement in 2008. He retired  as a  master sergeant (E-
8)  (Tr. 18).  While  in the  Army, he  supervised  as many  as  40 soldiers. (Tr. 27) When  he
retired, he  received  the  Soldier’s Medal, the  highest award  for heroism  not involving  the
enemy. (AE T)  He held a security clearance for his entire military career. (Tr. 26)
Applicant earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in business administration in 2004, and a
master’s degree in human resource management in 2005. (Tr. 25) Since 2014, he has
been working for a federal contractor as a functional analyst. (GE 1 at 12)
The debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a is not a delinquent automobile loan, as
alleged.  Instead, it is a timeshare property that became delinquent in 2018, leading to its
repossession  in  2019.  (GE  3  at  3: AE E) Applicant  paid the monthly payment through
automatic debit card payments. He contends that the account became delinquent after the
debit card expired and he neglected to switch the payment to his new debit card. (Tr. 49)
He recognizes that this was careless; however, he contends that he overlooked this bill, as
he was preoccupied with the expense and care of his elderly parents. (Tr. 41) Specifically,
before his mother’s death in February 2019, she required 24-hour, in-home nursing care.
(Tr. 39) Before Applicant’s father’s death in January 2018, he required long-term care in a
nursing home. These elder care and medical costs overlapped for several months until
Applicant’s father’s death. In the time before Medicare began reimbursements for these
expenses, Applicant became financially overwhelmed. (Tr. 41)
On April 21, 2021, Applicant contacted the creditor and negotiated a settlement for
$3,885. (AE F at 2) He satisfied the debt through four payments made between April 21
and April 26, 2021. (AE F)
The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.b stems from a contract executed by Applicant
and a roofing company on July 19, 2014. Applicant agreed to pay $21,221 for a new roof.
(AE A) That day, he contracted with another company to finance the purchase of the roof.
(Tr. 69) Under a financing plan, Applicant borrowed the purchase price of the roof from the
financing company and agreed to repay it through monthly $332 payments over 15 years.
(AE D)  Applicant was initially displeased with the high interest rate, contending that it was
higher than promised. Consequently, on July 21, 2014, he contacted the roofing company
and expressed his intent to cancel the project. (AE B) In response, the roofing company
proposed to modify its contract with Applicant. (Tr. 54) Under the proposed modification,
the roofing company agreed to issue a $5,800 rebate to Applicant as soon as it received
the funds from the financing company. (AE A at 5; Tr. 56)
Applicant  agreed  to  the  modification.  (Tr.  59)  Subsequently,  after  the  roofing
company completed the work, the payments were debited automatically from Applicant’s
checking account to the loan financing company. (Tr. 59) Applicant did not receive the
$5,800 from the contractor, as agreed, however. He reached out to the roofing company
several times “to no avail.” (Tr. 69) He never sought a legal remedy for the alleged breach.
(Tr. 69) Instead, Applicant stopped making payments to the loan financing company in
2017, after having made payments consistently for three years. (Tr. 72)
Applicant  acknowledges  that  he  should  not  have  stopped  payment  to  the  loan
financing company, and that instead, he should have pursued a claim against the roofing
company for not paying him the rebate, as promised. (Tr. 72) Over the past year, Applicant
has contacted the loan financing company to resolve the delinquency. The loan company
rejected his effort to renegotiate the interest rate. (Tr. 71-72) As of the date of the SOR,
Applicant owed a $29,417 balance to the loan financing company, of which approximately
$9,644 was delinquent. (Answer at 2)
After the issuance of the SOR, Applicant contacted the loan financing company and
attempted to develop a payment plan. (Answer at 2) A company representative told him
that the debt had been written off, and that he would be receiving an IRS Form 1099C for
cancellation of a tax year 2020 debt. (Answer at 2) The IRS discharged the tax debt on
August 20, 2020. (AE D) Approximately $20,986 was discharged, and this amount will be
added to Applicant’s reportable gross income for the 2020 year. (Answer at 2)
The  debt  alleged  in  subparagraph  1.c  corresponds  to  the  debt  alleged  in
subparagraph 1.a. Specifically, it is a revolving timeshare maintenance fee, delinquent in
the amount of $591, with a balance of $4,229. (Answer at 2) As with the debt alleged in
SOR  subparagraph  1.a,  Applicant  had  been  making  payments  through  autopay,  but
inadvertently stopped when he received a debit card with a new account number. (Tr. 72)
In March 2020, when an agent interviewed Applicant, the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.a
remained outstanding, and it was still outstanding nine months later when DOHA issued
the  SOR.  In  March  2021,  Applicant  contacted  the  creditor  to  arrange  a  settlement
agreement. Applicant satisfied the debt later that month. (AE G)
Applicant did not focus on his bills between 2017 and 2019 when his parents were
sick because “bills didn’t matter” then. (Tr. 38) He knew this philosophy was wrong, but “it
was family first.” (Tr. 38)
Applicant  earns  $153,000  per  year.  (Tr.  32)  He  receives  a  $1,600  net  monthly
pension from the Army, and disability benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs,
totaling  $1,500  month.  (Tr.  33)  Applicant  has  approximately  $19,000  deposited  in  a
checking account, $5,000 in four savings accounts, and a total of approximately $160,000
invested in a thrift savings plan, a 401(k) account, and an e-Trade account. (Tr. 37; AE K –
AE L; AE N – AE Q)
Applicant owns his home and owns an investment property. He has approximately
$130,000 in equity in his home, and more than $100,000 of equity in his rental property.
(Tr. 102, 103) He has been making extra payments on his home mortgage in an effort to
satisfy the principal before it is due. (Tr. 100)
Applicant has four credit cards. Their balances collectively total less than $100. (AE
X through AE AA) He recently paid off his car note, and he is current on his child support
payments. (AE J, M)
