In  Applicant’s  answer to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  the allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.a and
denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 2.a. His admission is incorporated in my
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  30-year-old  employee  of  a  university  performing  research  as  a
federal contractor. He  graduated  from  high  school in  May  2008,  received  a  bachelor’s
degree  in May 2014, and  received  a master’s degree  in  August 2016. He has been an
employee of a federal contractor since November 2016. He has never married. He has
lived with a cohabitant since September 2013. He has no children.
In  Applicant’s 2016  SCA,  he  disclosed  that in August  2012, he was stopped for
speeding and had marijuana and paraphernalia in his car. He was not intoxicated and
was not arrested. He was given a ticket for speeding. He paid the fine for speeding. When
he  appeared  in  court  on  the  drug  charges,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  disorderly  conduct,
pursuant to a plea agreement. He paid $2,000 in fines and court fees and was placed on
unsupervised probation for one year. He completed his probation without incident and his
criminal record was expunged in March 2014. (FORM Item 6 at 10 and 13; FORM Item 7
at 31.)
In the 2016 SCA, Applicant also disclosed that he used marijuana several times a
month, off and on and mostly on weekends, between July 2008 and May 2016. He stated
that he did not intend to  use marijuana again “in  order to  pass drug tests and maintain
employment.” (FORM Item 7 at 33.) When he was interviewed by a security investigator
in March 2017, he stated that he did not associate with illegal drug users and that the
likelihood of  additional  drug  use  was  “zero” because  he did not  want to  jeopardize  his
career. (FORM Item 6 at 14.)
When Applicant submitted his April 2019 SCA, he repeated his earlier disclosures
of marijuana use and added a disclosure that he used it in September 2018. In both SCAs,
he admitted that he purchased marijuana for personal use.
When Applicant was interviewed in May 2019, he admitted that he continues to
associate with marijuana users and that he used it one time in September 2018 at a party.
He also stated that because marijuana is legal in the jurisdiction where he used it, he was
not aware that it was an issue for him to use it while holding a security clearance. (FORM
Item 6 at 10.) In response to interrogatories in June 2020, he stated that he used “a couple
puffs” of marijuana in September 2018 on weekends. (FORM Item 6 at 5.) In his answer
to  the  SOR,  he  denied  SOR  ¶  1.b,  alleging  use  of  marijuana  while  granted  access  to
classified information, asserting that he was not assigned to any classified programs and
has not had access to any classified information.
