The SOR alleges that the Applicant failed to file his Federal and state income tax
returns  for  tax  years  from  2013  through  2018,  and  that  he  is  indebted  to  the  Federal
government for delinquent taxes for tax years 2014, 2016 and 2017.  Applicant admits
allegations  1.a.  and  1.b.  set  forth  in  the  SOR.  He  denies  the  indebtedness  to  the
Federal government for delinquent taxes in the amounts alleged in the SOR.  Applicant
began working for his current employer in January 2018.  Applicant served in the U.S.
Army  from  1983  to  2006,  before  retiring  with  an  honorable  discharge.  (Government
Exhibit 2.)
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant explained that he did not file his Federal and
state  income  tax  returns  in  a  timely  fashion  because  he  was  missing  supporting
documents from 2013 and 2014 to substantiate his deductions.  He believed his income
tax returns could not be filed without this supporting documentation.  He states that all
of  his  income  tax  returns  in  question  were  filed  in  April  2020.  Applicant  has  provided
documentary  evidence  to  support  this  assertion.
(Government  Exhibit  2,  and
Applicant’s Exhibit A.)
With   respect  to   his  Federal  tax   liability,  the   SOR  alleges   that   Applicant   is
indebted  for  tax  year 2014  in the  amount  of $25,682.91;  tax  year 2016  in  the  amount  of
$22,697.45;  and   tax   year  2017   in  the   amount  of  $15,236.09.    This  assessment  was
based   on   the   IRS   filing   Applicant’s   tax   returns   as  “Married   Filing   Separately.”
Applicant’s  Response   to   the   FORM,   includes  Account   Statements   from   the   IRS,  and
copies of  endorsed  checks that show  Applicant has satisfied  his Federal tax  liability.  A
letter of Good  Standing  from  the  state  tax  authority  dated  December 23, 2020, indicates
that he  has filed  all  required  state  income  tax  returns and  paid  all state  taxes.    When
Applicant  filed  the  Federal and  state  income  tax  returns  in question, he  filed  as  “Married
Filing  Jointly,”  and  the  proper  adjustments  were  made  by  the  IRS.  Applicant  was
indebted for tax year 2014 in the amount of $1,309; no taxes were owed for 2016 and
2017.  Applicant received some refunds and paid off all of the debt he owes, including
all assessed penalties, interest and fees.  (Applicant’s Exhibit A.)
