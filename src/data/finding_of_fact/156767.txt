Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c,  2.a,  and  2.b  with  brief
explanations. His admissions and explanations are incorporated into the findings of fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is now 44 years old. He was born in Nigeria. He earned his bachelor’s
degree in Nigeria in 2000. (Tr. 91-92) He came to the United States in 2001, at age 24,
on a student visa, to pursue a master’s degree, which he earned in 2003. (GE 1 at 9; Tr.
47-48,  92-93)  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  defense  contractor,  for  15
years, since 2005. (Tr. 48) He is a software engineer, and has an annual salary of about
$130,000.  (Tr.  71,  73)  Applicant  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  2015.  Later  in  2015,  he
applied for access  to  sensitive  information.  (GE  6,  GE  7;  Tr. 49) That  application  was
granted, and he now seeks a security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 17)
Applicant  has been married  twice.  He  was  first  married from  2002 to  2009. (Tr.
49, 106) He and his second wife have been married since 2010. (GE 1; Tr. 49, 98) She
is  a  Nigerian  citizen  and  has  permanent  United  States  resident  status  until  July 2023.
(SOR  ¶  1.b)  She  has  applied  for  U.S.  citizenship.  (Tr.  45-46,  99-100,  229-231)  They
have  three  children,  now  ages  16,  8,  and  5;  all  of  them  are  native-born  U.S.  citizens.
(GE  1;  Tr.  50,  105-107)  Applicant’s  wife  works  at  a  local  university,  where  she  also
earned her degree. (Tr. 100-102) They own their current home and a former residence,
both in the United States. (Tr. 110-113)
Applicant’s mother and  father are citizens and  residents of Nigeria. (SOR ¶ 1.a)
(GE  1)  They  are  in  their  eighties  and  are  retired.  His  father  owned  a  restaurant.  His
mother was an accountant. Applicant talks to his parents about once a month.  (Tr. 64,
69,  78-81,  260-261;  GE  2  at  3)  He  testified  that  he  does  not  provide  them  financial
support.  (Tr. 82)  Applicant’s  two  siblings  reside  in  the  United  Kingdom  (UK).  They are
dual UK-Nigerian citizens. (Tr. 83)
After  coming   to   the   United   States,   Applicant   returned   to   Nigeria   in   2007   to   see
his family  and  to  attend  a friend’s wedding. (Tr. 67) He most  recently  travelled  to  Nigeria
in January  2020  before traveling  with  family  to  the  UK  for his mother’s 80th  birthday. (Tr.
64-68,  81,  225; GE  1)  Applicant used  his  U.S. passport for this trip, though  he  testified
that  he   has  since   renewed   his  Nigerian   passport.  (Tr.  96-98,  225-226;  GE   2   at  2)
Applicant also went to  the  UK  in 2017  for his father’s 80th  birthday. (Tr. 81)  His parents
have also visited the  United  States  in the past. (Tr. 119)
Applicant’s  mother-in-law   was  a   naturalized   U.S.  citizen   from   Nigeria.  She   lived
in the  United  States  for many  years, until passing  away  earlier this year. (Tr. 70-71; GE
1)   His  father-in-law   is   deceased.  (GE  1;   GE   2)   Applicant’s  wife   has  other  family   in
Nigeria   but  Applicant  and   his  wife   do   not  own   property   or  have   any   financial  interests
there.  (Tr.  107-109) Applicant  has  two  old  friends  in Nigeria  that he  keeps in touch  with.
(Tr. 93-95)
In about 2015, Applicant and his wife started a company (H) in the United States.
They  hoped  to  use  the  business  to  export  consumer  products,  such  as  baby  food,  to
Nigeria and other foreign countries where they saw a commercial need. They sought a
business  partnership  with  large  U.S.  retailers  but  this  pursuit  was  unsuccessful.  The
company remains in business. (Tr. 74, 208-213, 237-238; GE 4; GE 5)
In  late  2016,  Applicant’s wife  received  a phone  call from  a man  in Nigeria.  She
told Applicant that the man, Mr. E, was a distant cousin of hers who needed help with
his  business,  and  put  Applicant  on  the  phone  with  him.  When  they  spoke,  Mr.  E  told
Applicant  that  he  was  a  foreign-exchange  broker,  and  that  Mr.  E  wanted  to  use
Applicant’s  bank  accounts  in  the  United  States  to  transfer  money  between  unknown
individuals in the U.S. and one of Mr. E’s clients, a travel agency in South Africa. (GE 2
at 9; Tr. 50-60, 69)
Applicant agreed to help Mr. E. Between October and December 2016, Applicant
and  Mr.  E  arranged  and  confirmed  numerous  bank  transactions  through  a  text
messaging  application  (app).  (Tr.  50-54;  120;  GE  4;  GE  2  at  9)  The  transcript  of  their
text  conversations  is  detailed  in  GE  4,  a  document  provided  by  Applicant  during  his
background interview and discussed in the hearing at Tr. 124-205. (The pages in GE 4
are in quadrants, and require a magnifying glass to read; see Tr. 77).
Applicant  gave  Mr.  E  his  bank  routing  number  and  account  information  to
facilitate  the  money  transfers. When  Mr.  E  or  his  associates  in  the  United  States  had
made a deposit into Applicant’s bank account, Mr. E would text Applicant a photo of the
deposit slip, and then Applicant would message his confirmation of the deposited funds.
(Tr. 126-127)
Applicant  utilized  several  of  his  accounts  at  multiple  U.S.  banks  for  these
transactions. (Tr. 159, 170-171; GE 2 at 3, 9) He mostly used an account at Bank A, an
account  that  was  largely  a  business  bank  account  for  his  and  his  wife’s  company,
Company  H.  (Tr.  114,  123,  208-213;  GE  5)  Applicant  also  testified  that  he  used  the
Bank A account for his own personal and household expenses. (Tr. 235-236)
Applicant  testified  that  he  would  wire  funds  for  Mr.  E  to  various  foreign  bank
accounts,  in  South  Africa,  China,  and  Turkey,  as  well  as  Nigeria.  (Tr.  129-130,  160,
175-176,  184,  243-244;  GE  2  at  9)  Applicant  did  not  know  any  of  the  people  he
transacted  with.  (Tr.  130)  The  deposits  often  involved  large  sums  of  money,  almost
always well over $10,000 and at times over $100,000. (Tr. 130-131, 156-158, 173, 202)
Applicant would then wire the  deposited  funds to  Mr. E’s client,  the  travel company, or
to other foreign accounts. (GE 4 at 2) Most of the finds were in U.S. dollars but some of
the funds were in “naira,” a Nigerian currency. (Tr. 143-146)
Applicant testified  that  he  kept his wife  informed  about the  transactions with  Mr.
E. (Tr. 148-153) The  app  transcript confirms this. (GE 4  at 1, GE  4  at 5) (“Please  talk to
[Applicant’s wife]  about it.”)  By  mid-November 2016, Applicant appears to  have  wanted
Company  H to  be more formally  involved  with  the money  transfers.  As he  told Mr. E  in a
text on  November 9, 2016, however, he recognized  that Company  H  was not “licensed
to  deal  in  currency. Otherwise any  account  will eventually  be  flagged  if funds  (especially
large   amounts)  are  consistently   wired   out  of  the   country.  This  will   need   to   be   sorted
properly to ensure this is sustainable.” (GE 4  at 5)
A week later, that is exactly what happened, as Applicant reported to Mr E that
the  bank  had  closed  the  account  and  refunded  him  the  balance  by  check.  (Tr.  56-60,
189-194; GE 2 at 9; GE 4 at 5) Applicant said in his background interview that he  told
Mr. E to stop arranging the deposits, but they continued for a time. (GE 2 at 9)
As  late  as  December  15,  2016,  though,  Applicant  was  still  pursuing  a  role  for
Company H in the process. (“The document still  doesn’t state what [Company H’s] role
is  in  this  process;  when  [Company  H’s]  role  is  established,  there’s  still  the  issue  of
licensing to deal in / distribute currency here in the U.S.”) (GE 4 at 5)
Applicant said he  had  one  more phone  call  with  Mr. E  after December 2016, but
has had  no  contact  with  him  since  then.  Applicant’s wife  no  longer has contact  with  Mr
E. (Tr. 205-207) Applicant and Mr. E never met. (Tr. 225)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  the  FBI  in  2017,  and  cooperated  with  their
investigation.  He  said  in  his  background  interview  that  the  FBI  told  him  that  the
transactions suggested possible money laundering or a scam. Neither Applicant nor his
wife were charged or arrested. (GE 2 at 9; Tr. 205, 229)
Applicant  testified  that  at  the  time  he  began  the  transactions  with  Mr.  E,  he
“thought nothing of it” because it “seemed like something legitimate” (50-51) He said he
“just thought I was doing my wife’s family a favor. And then it turned into a nightmare.”
(Tr. 75) Applicant also testified that while he was engaged in the transactions with Mr.
E, he became concerned about them. He testified that he “didn’t want to have anything
to  do  with  any kind  of  fraud.  I  told  him  this on  numerous occasions.” He  said  the  only
reason he did it was because his wife recommended it. (Tr. 241, 242)
Applicant did not list Mr. E as a foreign contact on his SCA, nor did he list any of
the large financial transactions they had. (GE 1) In particular, Applicant did not disclose
his relationship with Mr. E in answering questions on his SCA such as “Have you EVER
provided financial support for any foreign national?”; and “Have you in the last seven (7)
years provided advice or support to any individual associated with a foreign business or
other  foreign  organization  that  you  have  not  previously  listed  as  a  former  employer?”
and “Has any foreign national in the last seven (7) years offered you a job, asked you to
work  as  a  consultant  or  consider  employment  with  them?”  and  “Have  you  in  the  last
seven  (7)  years  been  involved  in  any  other  type  of  business  venture  with  a  foreign
national  not  described  above  (own,  co-own,  serve  as  business  consultant,  provide
financial  support,  etc.)”  (GE  1  at  29-30)  Applicant  answered  “No”  to  all  of  these
questions. Falsification of Applicant’s SCA is not alleged in the SOR under Guideline E,
but this evidence can be considered in weighing mitigation and under the whole-person
concept.
Applicant also did not disclose the transactions with Mr. E during his background
interviews and did not discuss them until he was confronted about them.  (Tr. 147-148,
207;  GE  1,  GE  2,  GE  3)  Applicant  indicated  that  he  did  not  initially  disclose  the
transactions  because  he  assumed  the  government  already  knew  about  them.  He  was
also embarrassed about them and wanted to be done with the issue. (GE 2 at 8-9)
Applicant has a cousin in Nigeria (Mr. O) to whom he is particularly close. (SOR ¶
1.c) Mr. O  is “like a  brother”  to  him. (Tr. 241)  Mr. O was born  in Nigeria. He  lived  in the
United  States from   1990   to  about 2017. He is a   dual U.S.-Nigerian   citizen.  (Tr.  46-47,
89)  (In  addressing  the  admissibility  of  GE  2  and  GE  3, Applicant’s background  interview
summaries,  Applicant  adopted  them  as accurate  except  where they  describe  Mr. O  as  a
Nigerian   citizen   only.)   (Tr.  38-40)   In   fact,   the   summaries  indicate   that  Applicant
described Mr. O as a dual citizen. (See, e.g., GE 2 at 6))
Applicant  saw  Mr.  O  on  his  trip  to  Nigeria  in  2020.  He  said  the  cousin  owns  a
farm. (Tr. 68-69, 215, 225) Applicant acknowledged that they are close and they remain
in quarterly contact. (Tr. 90-91)
In early January 2019, Applicant made several deposits into U.S. bank accounts,
using funds from his cousin Mr. O. The deposits totaled about $72,000. Applicant used
the money to purchase a luxury vehicle for Mr. O in the U.S., and to ship the vehicle to
him  in  Nigeria.  (SOR  ¶  2.b)  (Tr.  60-62;  214-218,  227-229;  GE  2  at  6)  Applicant
acknowledged  that  “there  are  probably  only  two  or  three  people  that  I  would  even
entertain  buying  a  car  for  now  in  hindsight.  And  [Mr.  O]  is  one  of  them.”  (Tr.  240)
Applicant otherwise denied that he had ever wired money to Mr. O, and denied that Mr
O was involved with the transactions Applicant had with Mr. E. (Tr. 219)
Applicant  had  engaged  in  similar  conduct  previously.  As  addressed  in  the
summary of Applicant’s April 5, 2019 background interview, Applicant has made similar
purchases on his father’s behalf  about three times in recent years, with funds his father
deposited in Applicant’s bank account. (Tr. 219-223; GE 2 at 10-11) Those transactions
were not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant also bought a sport utility vehicle for a friend in Nigeria in 2009 or 2010,
and shipped the vehicle to him there, using about $58,000 in funds the friend deposited,
in multiple deposits, in  Applicant’s U.S. bank account.  (Tr. 86-89; GE 2 at 7) Applicant
testified that he has made no  other wire transfers to any foreign companies or people.
(Tr. 223-224) These transactions are not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant denied  doing  anything  illegal. (Tr. 64) He never suspected  his  actions
might  be   problematic  until  he   was  contacted   by   the   FBI.  (GE  2   at  9)  Applicant  also
testified   that  there  was  “no   chance   in  hell”  that  he   would  again   engage   in  financial
transactions  like   he   did   in  2016   with   Mr.  E,   because   “I’m   living   [in]  hell   already.”  (Tr.
239)  “I would never do  that again. Never,” he  said. (Tr. 241)
Applicant testified that his allegiance is to the United States, and it “wouldn’t even
be a hard decision for me.” (Tr. 262) He has spent his adult life here. He has returned to
Nigeria only three times since emigrating to the U.S. He recognizes his poor judgment
in hindsight and said he would not engage in that conduct again. (Tr. 261-266)
Applicant  provided  reference  letters  from  several  personal  friends  and  work
colleagues. They have all known him for 12-15 years, and attest to his trustworthiness,
discipline,  and  dedication  to  his  work;  as  well  as  his  honesty  and  ability  to  protect
sensitive information. (AE A)
Nigeria
Nigeria is a federal republic located in Western Africa. Its current president took
office in 2015, following the first democratic transfer of power in the country’s history. He
was  reelected  in  2019.  Nigeria  has  faced  many  challenges,  including  terrorist  activity,
sectarian conflicts, crime, kidnapping, and widespread mistrust of the government.
The  U.S. State  Department  advises  U.S.  citizens  to  reconsider travel to  Nigeria
due to COVID-19, crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and maritime crimes.  Boko
Haram and ISIS-West Africa, both U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations, are
active  in  Nigeria,  and  seek  to  replace  the  Nigerian  government  with  an  Islamic  state.
Attacks against state and civilian targets, primarily northern Nigerian states continued in
recent years.

Internet  postings/profiles or  by  unsolicited  emails  and
Financial and internet romance scams are prevalent in Nigeria. Scams are often
letters.
initiated
Scammers  almost  always  pose  as  U.S.  citizens  who  have  no  one  else  to  turn to for
help.  Common  scams  include:  romance/online  dating;  money  transfers;  contracts  with
promises of large commissions; and inheritance notices. The fact that money transfers
are prevalent scams in Nigeria is of particular relevance in this case.
Human-rights  issues  in  Nigeria  in  recent  years  have  included  unlawful  and
arbitrary  killings,  forced  disappearances,  torture  by  both  government  and  non-state
actors,  and  arbitrary  detention,  often  based  on  little  evidence.  Nigeria  has  one  of  the
world’s lowest per capita social spending levels, resulting in sixty-five percent of its 186
million  citizens  living  in  extreme  poverty.  These  conditions  breed disaffection  in  youth,
provide an entry point for Islamic extremism, entice corruption, and promote ineffective
governance.
