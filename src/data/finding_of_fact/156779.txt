Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant has nine delinquent student-
loan accounts totaling $139,859,  and one delinquent personal-loan  account of  $1,139.
Applicant admits each of the allegations. The delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant’s
credit  bureau  reports  (CBR)  from  February  2021,  August  2020,  February  2030,  and
October 2018, listed on his e-QIP, and discussed during his personal subject interviews
(PSI). (GX 4 through GX 7; GX 2; GX 8.) Applicant’s admissions are incorporated in my
findings of fact.
Applicant,  54,  is  a  desktop  support  engineer  currently  working  for  a  defense
contractor since August 2018. He received  his associate’s degree  in 2015.  He and his
wife married in 2004. Applicant has two children who are 29 and 13. (GX 3.)
On  his e-QIP,  Applicant stated  that  he  incurred  the  student-loan  debts for  his  and
his  daughter’s  college   educations.  He  explained   that  he   was  working   with   a   collection
agency   to   pay   the   debts.   He  also   listed   three   delinquent  medical  debts  totaling
approximately  $776, two  of which he  was making  monthly  payments of $50  each, and
one  of which he  was working  on  setting  up  a  payment  plan. He  explained  that he  incurred
these  debts after undergoing various surgeries and  was unable to  pay  the  accounts after
being  laid  off  from  his job. However, under the  employment activities section  of  the  e-QIP,
Applicant did not list that he had been  laid off  by  any  of  his previous  employers between
2004  and  2018.  He did  list that from  July  until  October 2016  he  was self-employed  as a
ride-share driver after having  left his previous  employer by  mutual agreement after being
notified of unsatisfactory performance.
In his November 2018 PSI, Applicant discussed his prior employment record, but
did not state that he had been laid off from any previous employer. He asserted that he
had entered a payment plan and was making monthly payments on his student loans. In
a follow-up PSI in January 2019, Applicant clarified that he had set up his payment plan
in October 2019. His December 2021 CBR shows that Applicant made some payments
on his student loans, but none since April 2019. (GX 4.)
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant attributed his delinquent debts to having been
diagnosed with a chronic disease which required several surgeries and ongoing, regular
treatments.  He did not reference  any other cause for his financial difficulties, including
having  been  laid  off  from  a  previous  employer.  He  asserted  that  he  had  entered  a
repayment  arrangement  that  would  begin  on  February  28,  2021.  The  terms  of  the
arrangement  were  that  he  would  pay  $701  per  month  on  the  consolidated  total  debt
amount  of  his  student  loans.  However,  there  is  no  record  evidence  to  support  this
assertion.  All  of  the  delinquent  student-loan  accounts  were  assigned  to  collection
between  September 2010  and  September 2014. (GX  7.) The  debts alleged  in SOR ¶¶
1.a through  1.i remain unresolved.
Applicant  also  stated  in  his  answer  to  the  SOR  that  he  left  four  telephone
messages  between  December  2020  and  January  2021  for  the  creditor  of  the  $1,139
personal loan debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j in an effort to arrange a repayment plan, but that
the creditor never returned his calls. This debt was assigned to collection in January 2018.
This debt remains unresolved.
