Applicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR, except for SOR allegation ¶ 1.j.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  She  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  February  of  2020.  She  currently  does  not
hold a security clearance. Since November of 2018, she has been pending divorce from
her spendthrift husband. She has one child. (TR at page 20 line 15 to page 29 line 3.)
She attributes her current financial situation her husband’s deleterious  spending ways.
In addition, he also lost his job in 2017. (Id and TR at page 30 lines 10~13.)
