Financial Considerations
Applicant’s three delinquent SOR debts totaling $320,252 are established by his
November 18,  2019;  January 24,  2020;  October 5,  2020;  and  February 2,  2021  credit
reports  as  well  as  by  admissions  in  his  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions
(SF-86) and his November 20, 2020 SOR Answer. The three debts consist of a $12,516
charged-off credit-card debt and two collection-account student loans totaling $307,736.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a -1.c; Items 2 -7)
In  his  SF-86,  Applicant  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  a  “[h]ard  year  with
change of employment, shutdown, medical expenses.” He added that he “[w]ill get back
on schedule and re-establish cycles of payment within 3-6 months.” (Item 3 at 37) In the
same SF-86, Applicant stated he would do the following to address his financial issues,
“In  the  mean-time  of  reorganization,  I  am  still  making  payments  to  fit  budget  in  the
mean-time  (sic).  I  am  in  the  process  of  removing  additional  loans  with  payoff  and
establish  free  cash  to  catch  up  on  payments.  Hopefully  not  affected  shutdown  Dec
2019.”  (Item  3  at  37)  Applicant  further  suggested  that  he  was  in  the  process  of
“reorganizing”  his  student  loans,  and  was  continuing  to  make  monthly  payments  of
undisclosed amounts. (Id at 37-38)
In Applicant’s SOR Answer, he submitted evidence that he made $350 payments
on December 23, 2019; January 23, 2020; June 29, 2020; August 3, 2020; August 17,
2020; September 1, 2020; October 1, 2020; and November 2, 2020 towards SOR ¶ 1.a
($12,517  charged-off  credit  card  account),  and  submitted  evidence  that  he  made
payments  on  October 25,  2019;  November 23,  2019;  December 5,  2019;  January 30,
2020; February 28, 2020; March 26, 2020; April 29, 2020; May 29, 2020; June 30, 2020;
July 30, 2020; August 26, 2020; August 31, 2020; September 18, 2020; and November

current information available.
6,  2020  towards  his  two  student  loans  totaling  $307,736.  However,  he  blacked  out  all
information pertaining to payment amount, amount applied to principal, amount applied
to  interest,  and  amount  applied  to  fees  and  charges.  (Item  2)  Applicant’s  February  2,
2021  credit  report  reflects  that  he  paid  $3  towards  his  smaller  student  loan  and  $96
towards his larger student loan. (Item 4)
Department  Counsel’s  FORM  provided  specific  shortcomings  of  Applicant’s
answer. As noted, Applicant submitted a response  to the FORM. He submitted a copy
of Forms 1098-E Student Loan Interest Statements for 2019 and 2020 with the amounts
of student loan interest received blacked out. He also submitted a letter stating that his
prescription for eight months of Otezla cost $3,591, and his prescription for two years of
Cosentyx cost $6,057. It is unclear how much, if any, of these prescriptions are or will
be covered by insurance. (Item 8)
In his response to FORM, Applicant discussed his fear of COVID-19 stating that
he lives “in  complete fear that as I go  to  work every day I could have  a  reaction  to  the
disease, but my family is a priority.” (Item 8)
