Applicant  is  a  35-year-old  data  center  technician  for  a  defense  contractor  who
seeks a security clearance. Applicant admitted each of the allegations in the SOR with
explanations, and findings of fact follow.
Background
Applicant married in March 2010 and divorced in October 2015. (GE 1; Tr. 30-31)
He  has  no  children  from  this  marriage.  He  currently  resides  with  his  girlfriend,  with
whom  he  has  a  co-habitation  relationship.  (Tr.  42-43)  Applicant  earned  a  high  school
diploma in May 2003 and attended college classes between August 2003 and May 2005
at a respected university. (GE 1; Tr. 27) He did not earn a degree or diploma. Between
December  2011  and  May  2013,  he  accrued  college  credits  at  another  college  but  did
not  earn  a  degree  or  diploma.  (GE  1;  Tr.  27)  Applicant  enlisted  in  his  state’s  Army
National  Guard  Reserve  in  January  2009  and  served  seven  years  of  inactive  military
reserve-duty  before  receiving  an  honorable  discharge  in  January  2016.  (GE  1)  He
reenlisted in his state’s Army National Guard in 2009, and continued his military service
in his state’s Army National Guard until January 2021. (GEs 1-2; Tr.  26)
Since March 2018, Applicant has worked for his current contractor employer as a
service  desk  representative.  (GE  1)  Previously,  he  worked  for  other  non-military
contractor employers in various types of technical jobs. (GE 1; Tr. 29-37)
Applicant’s finances
Following his divorce in October 2015, Applicant encountered difficulties keeping
up  with  the  debts  assigned  to  him  for  payment  responsibility  as  a  part  of  his  divorce
decree,  and  petitioned  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  protection.  (GEs  2-4;  Tr.  31-33)  He
attributed his bankruptcy petition to his divorce that left him without enough income and
assets to meet his financial obligations imposed on him in his final divorce decree. (GE
2; Tr.  22-23)
In his Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, Applicant listed assets of $11,346 and total
liabilities  of  $101,304.  (GE  3)  He  scheduled  non-priority  unsecured  debts  of  $86,075.
(GE  3)  Of  the  listed  non-priority  debts,  all  but  $5,808  represented  student  loan  debts.
He  reported  monthly  income  of  $2,320  and  monthly  expenses  of  $2,110.  (GE  3)  He
received his bankruptcy discharge in April 2016. (GE 3)
Between   2016   and   2019,   Applicant  accumulated   three   additional  delinquent
debts  exceeding  $4,500. (GEs 2, 4-5) He has since  documented  his resolving  each  of
these   debts  with   payoffs  and   payment   plans.  (AEs  A-D)   Specifically,  he   provided
probative  documentation  of  his payment in full  of  the  $1,908  SOR   ¶  1.b  debt in  March
2021.  (AE  A)  He  provided  documentary  proof as well  of  his  paying  off  the  $526  SOR ¶
1.c debt and $2,167 SOR ¶  1.d debt. (AEs C-D)
Applicant  provided  a  monthly  budget  for  April  2021.  (AE  B)  In  his  budget,  he
reported  monthly  income  of  $3,357,  monthly  expenses  of  $2,949,  and  a  net  monthly
remainder  of  $131.  (AE  B;  Tr.  58)  Applicant  characterized  his  budget  as  generally
typical of his monthly income and expense breakdown. (AE B) He is current with his tax
filings  and  payments  (both  federal  and  local),  and  his  accrued  student  loans  are
currently in deferment status. (GEs 3-5; Tr. 57-58)
