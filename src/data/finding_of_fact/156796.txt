Applicant is 47 years old. He has been employed by a defense contractor since
2015.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  military  from  1994  until  he  was  honorably
discharged  in  1996.  He  is  applying  for  a  security  clearance  for  the  first  time  since  he
was in the military. He has an  associate’s  degree, which he earned in 1999. The most
recent information available indicates that he is married with two children. (Items 3, 4)
The SOR alleges two defaulted student loans totaling $54,207 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and
1.h);  three  miscellaneous  delinquent  debts  totaling  $898  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b-1.d);  and  three
unpaid medical debts totaling $249 (SOR ¶¶ 1.e-1.g). Applicant admitted owing the two
student loans. He provided mixed answers regarding the remaining debts. The alleged
debts  are  listed  on  an  August  2019  credit  report,  a  March  2020  credit  report,  or  both
credit reports. (Items 2, 5, 6)
Applicant reported his defaulted student loans and a delinquent credit card debt
(SOR ¶ 1.b -$479) on his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), which
he  submitted  in  August  2018.  His  explanation  about  his  student  loans  has  remained
consistent. He thought he paid off his student loans in the 2003 to 2006 timeframe. He
was contacted about them and made several payments, but then did not hear back from
the holder of the loans. His tax refund was withheld on one occasion. He did not know
what institution currently held the loans, so he was unable to set up payments. He wrote
in his response to the SOR that he was finally more financially stable than he had been
in the past, and he fully intended to clear the loans. (Items 2-6)
Applicant  admitted  owing  the  three  miscellaneous  debts,  but  he  stated  that  he
unsuccessfully  attempted  to  pay  the  $479  credit  card  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b;  he
returned the item that was the basis for the $268 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 2.c; and he paid
the $151 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d. He provided no supporting documentation, and all
three debts are listed on the most recent credit report in evidence. (Items 2-6)
Applicant asserted that he paid one of the three medical debts, and was unable
to verify the creditors for the remaining two debts. The three medical debts were listed
on  the  August  2019  combined  credit  report,  but  not  the  March  2020  Equifax  credit
report. (Items 2, 5, 6)
Applicant  stated  that he  only recently started concerning himself  with  his credit.
He  submitted  his  SF  86  in  August  2019;  he  was  interviewed  in  September  2019;  he
received and answered the SOR in late 2020 or early 2021; and he received the FORM,
which  advised  him  of  the  importance  of  documentation,  in  February  2021.  He  did  not
respond to the FORM, so it is unknown if he followed up on any of his stated intentions.
