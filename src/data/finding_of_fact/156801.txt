Applicant is 58 years old. He has been employed by a defense contractor since
April 2018. He is applying for a security clearance for the first time. He is a high school
graduate.  The  most  recent  information  available  indicates  that  he  has  never  married,
and he has no children. (Items 3, 4)
The SOR alleges three delinquent debts totaling about $8,600 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c);
that Applicant did not file his federal income tax returns as required for tax years 2016,
2017, and 2019; (SOR ¶ 1.d); he did not file his State A income tax return as required
for  tax  year  2016  (SOR  ¶  1.e);  and  he  did  not  file  his  State  B  income  tax  returns  as
required for tax years 2017 and 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.f).
Applicant admitted owing the three delinquent debts. He stated that he could not
pay his debts because he was living beyond his means. He did not submit any evidence
of payments. (Items 1, 3-6)
Applicant  denied  the  tax  allegations.  When  he  submitted  his  Questionnaire  for
National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in  July  2018,  he  reported  that  he  did  not  file  his
federal and State B income tax returns in “Year: 2017 (Estimated),” because he did not
receive all of his W2 forms, and he owed “$250 (Estimated).” He wrote that he had not
taken any action out of fear of penalties, and  that he was  unsure who  to  talk to about
finding out amounts owed and payment options. He provided similar information during
his background interview in January 2019. (Items 1-3)
When  he  responded  to  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA)
interrogatories  in  November  2020,  Applicant  provided  a  copy  of  an  IRS  account
transcript  for  2016  that  showed  that  a  federal  tax  return  was  not  received  for  that  tax
year. He reported that all of his federal and state tax returns for tax years 2016 through
2019  had  been  filed.  He  stated  that  his federal  income  tax  returns  for  2016  and  2017
were filed in 2016 and 2017, and that his state tax returns for 2016 through 2018 were
filed in 2016, 2017, and 2018. (Item 3)
Applicant  apparently  made  a  common  error  and  confused  the  tax  year  with  the
year the returns were filed. Returns cannot be filed until the year following the tax year. I
believe  he  may  have  made  the  same  error  on  his  SF  86  and  during  his  background
investigation. That would explain  why the  unfiled  2016  returns were reported  as “Year:
2017 (Estimated).”
There is no evidence that Applicant was ever required to file State A income tax
returns.  There  is  no  reliable  evidence  that  Applicant  failed  to  file  his  2017  and  2019
state  and federal income  tax  returns.  He  did  not  submit  any  documentary evidence  to
establish that his 2016 federal income tax return has been filed.
