Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  32-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX 1  at  page  7.)
He has been employed with the defense contractor since January of 2020. (TR at page
14 lines 19~24.). He does not have a security clearance. (TR at page 14 line 14 to page
18 line 19.) He is single, and has two children. (TR at page 14 lines 14~18.) Applicant
attributes his current financial difficulties to a loss of employment. (TR at page 14 line 14
to page 18 line 19.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a.  Applicant  is  indebted  to  State  A  for  back  child  support,  in  the  amount  of
about $3,886, as evidenced by documentation from State A. (TR at page 20 line 13 to
page  21 line 8, and AppX A.) He is making monthly payments of $86 towards this debt,
which is in arrears. (Id.)
1.b.  Applicant  is  indebted  to  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS),  by  his  own
estimation,  in  the  amount  of  about  $7,000  for  tax  years  2018  and  2019.  Furthermore,
Applicant has yet to file his income tax returns for tax year 2019. (TR at page 21 line 9
to  page  24  line  4.)  Despite  having  a  month  to  do  so,  Applicant  has  submitted  nothing
further in this regard. (TR at page 33 line 22 to page 34 line 6.)
1.c. Applicant is indebted to Creditor C in the amount of about $474. (TR at page
24  lines  5~21.)  Despite  having  a  month  to  do  so,  Applicant  has  submitted  nothing
further in this regard. (TR at page 34 line 6 to page 35 line 9.)
1.d. Applicant has had his mortgage loan with Creditor D modified; and as such,
is current with his mortgage. (TR at page 24 line 22 to page 26 line 7.) This is evidenced
by documentation from Creditor D. (AppX C at pages 4~5.)
1.e.~1.k.  Applicant  is  addressing  his  past-due  debts  to  seven  creditors,  in  the
amount of about $10,522, through a debt-consolidation service. (TR at page 26 line 8 to
page  28  line  18.)  This  is  evidenced  by  documentation  from  said  debt  consolidation
service. (AppX B.)
1.l.  Applicant is indebted to Creditor L in the amount of about $495. (TR at page
28 line 19 to page 29 line 15.) Despite having a month to do so, Applicant has submitted
nothing further in this regard.
