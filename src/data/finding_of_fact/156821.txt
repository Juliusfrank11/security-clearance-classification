I have incorporated Applicant’s admissions in his Answer in my findings of fact and
have noted therein his admissions and comments on his debts and his past drug use. I
note that Applicant failed to admit or deny in his Answer the falsification allegation in SOR
¶  3.a.  I  have  treated  that  allegation  as  denied.  Applicant’s  personal  information  is
extracted from GE 1, his 2017 SCA, unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation
to the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony,
and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant, 34, is married and has two young children. He received a high school
diploma in 2004 and has taken some college courses, but he has not earned a degree.
In December 2008, he received a Correctional Academy Certificate. (Tr. at 17.)
Starting  in  2009  at  age  19,  Applicant  sought  a  position  in  law  enforcement,
specifically with CBP. At that time, it was important to him work in that field. In 2009, he
submitted  an  Electronic  Questionnaire  for  Investigative  Processing  (e-QIP)  seeking
employment with CBP. After taking a polygraph examination in July 2013, he was advised
that he was not going to be considered. He testified that he never inquired why he was
disqualified. He testified that at the point, he had “already invested myself into the career
I am currently at now.” (Tr. at 17-20, 25, 58-61, 73.)
In November 2012, Applicant began his career working as a contractor for the U.S.
Navy performing ship repairs. In about February 2018, he started working for his current
employer  in  the  same  field.  Initially,  he  took  a  pay  cut  of  about  $10,000  because  he
believed that he would advance quickly and would ultimately earn a higher income. He
has  since  been  promoted  to  be  a  site  manager  and  a  level-one  supervisor  for  this
company,  a  Navy  contractor,  which  is  sponsoring  Applicant  to  apply  for  a  security
clearance. According to Applicant, he presently has an interim clearance. (Tr. at 18-20,
25, 58-61, 68.)
Financial Considerations
In  September  2012,  Applicant began  to  experience financial  difficulties  after  his
wife was laid off. She was pregnant at the time with their first child. She lost her annual
income of $40,000 to $50,000. As a result, Applicant and his family had to live solely on
his income, which was $70,000 to $75,000. In the following months, Applicant was unable
to pay his bills. On the advice of an attorney, he filed for bankruptcy on May 13, 2013,
under Chapter 7. (GE 2 at 3; GE 8 at 1-4; AE H; Tr. at 20-22.)
In addition to Applicant’s 2013 bankruptcy, the SOR alleges three delinquent debts
owed to a credit union, two credit-card accounts and one loan opened by Applicant to
consolidate his debts. He opened these accounts after his bankruptcy discharge, hoping
to  reestablish  his  prior  solid  credit.  The  Government’s  evidence  reflects  that  the  three
debts  became  delinquent  in  mid-2016.  Applicant  testified  that  at  that  time,  he  was  not
making enough money to pay his bills. He was earning about $75,000 per year. (GE 5 at
3; GE 6 at 2; GE 7 at 4-5; GE 10 at 2; Tr. at 23, 31-33, 54.)
As described generally above and alleged in the SOR, Applicant has the following
three delinquent debts owed to a credit union:
SOR  ¶   1.a   -  Credit-Card   Account   in  the   amount   of   $20,304.   Applicant  opened  this
account in August 2013, the same month as his bankruptcy discharge. The credit limit on
the account was $19,300. He defaulted on this account in 2016. In late 2018, he received
a promotion and a pay raise. In February 2019, he entered into a payment plan with the
credit union to repay this debt at the monthly rate of $100. At the time, he was earning a
higher salary and could afford to begin paying his three debts owed to the credit union.
The  payment  plan  for  this  debt  is  scheduled  to  continue  for  202  months,  or  about  17
years. Applicant provided documentation from the creditor evidencing his compliance with
his payment plan. He intends to begin paying this debt off sooner with funds from a merit
pay raise he expects to receive soon and with excess money he will have once his other
debts to the credit union are paid off. This debt is being resolved. (GE 5 at 3; GE 6 at
2; GE 7 at 4-5; GE 10 at 2; AE E at 3; Tr. at 22-28.)
SOR  ¶   1.b   -  Debt-Consolidation Loan   Account   in  the   amount  of   $7,486.  Applicant
opened this account in October 2015. He defaulted on this account in May 2016, about
seven  months  later.  Again  in  February  2019,  he  entered  into  a  payment  plan  with  the
credit union to repay this debt at the monthly rate of $100 for  77 months. He provided
documentation  from  the  creditor evidencing his  compliance  with  his  payment  plan.  He
plans  to  increase  his  monthly  payments  with  his  next  pay  raise.  This  debt  is  being
resolved. (GE 5 at 3; GE 6 at 2; GE 7 at 5; GE 10 at 2; AE E at 1; Tr. at 27-28.)
SOR  ¶   1.c   -  Credit-Card  Account   in  the   amount   of   $3,319.   Applicant  opened  this
account in September 2015. He defaulted on the debt in May 2016. Since March 2019,
he has been paying the creditor $50 per month. He provided documentation reflecting his
payments  and  current  status  under  the  payment  plan.  He  intends  to  repay  the  entire
amount more quickly than the 68 months provided for under the plan. This debt is being
resolved. (GE 5 at 3; GE 6 at 2; GE 7 at 5; GE 10 at 2; AE E at 2; Tr. at 29.)
The fourth allegation under Guideline F in the SOR is the following:
SOR  ¶   1.d   -  2013   Chapter  7   Bankruptcy   Petition.  Applicant  filed  his petition  in  May
2013. He listed about $35,000 of unsecured debts and $39,000 of secured debts, which
were  debts  on  two  vehicles.  He  returned  the  two  vehicles  to  the  lenders,  and  his
unsecured debts and the balances of the auto loans were discharged in August 2013. As
explained above, he was unable to pay his debts in 2013 because his wife had lost her
job and he was unable to pay the family expenses without her income. (GE 8 at 1-2; AE
H; Tr. at 30-31, 46, 54-55, 80-81.)
Applicant considers himself financially stable, and he works hard to live within his
means. He has taken a financial-counseling class online that taught financial planning,
budgeting, and investments. As a result of his past financial problems, he has learned to
budget his expenses and avoid overspending. He uses a computerized bill-pay system
to plan and track his spending. Aside from the above three debts, he pays off his debts
every month and has zero balances. Applicant testified that his wife is now reemployed,
and she uses her income to pay some small bills. She has no separate debts and has
good  credit.  His  annual  income  has  increased  to  approximately  $91,000,  and  his  wife
earns another $55,000 to $60,000. He also has a retirement account with about $43,000
in assets. He maintains a savings account with about $3,500 to $4,000 for emergencies.
(AE D; AE F; Tr. at 23, 31-34, 49-54.)
Drug Involvement
Applicant testified that the last time he used any illegal drugs was in 2004. He was
a senior in high school at the time. His use of marijuana was experimental. He no longer
associates with his high school friends who used marijuana with him. He always avoids
environments where drug use might occur. In addition, he has signed a statement of intent
in  which  he  pledged  never  to  use  any  illegal  drugs  in  the  future.  He  has  also  tested
negative for drug use for seven or eight months preceding the hearing.  In addition, he
completed an online, drug-counseling course. He has no intent to use illegal drugs in the
future because he does not approve of them, and with his two children, he wants to set
the right example for them. (AE J; AE K; AE L; Tr. at 35-38.)
As noted, Applicant aspired to work in law enforcement. He aggressively pursued
this career goal for three years. He applied for a position with the CBP in 2009. He testified
that the hiring process took an unusually long time, in part, due to a hiring freeze at CBP.
He also testified that he was randomly tested for illegal drug use and no longer used any
illegal  drugs  while  his  application  was  pending.  One  of  the  last  requirements  of  the
application process was a polygraph exam, which he took in July 2013. (GE 1 at 13; GE
2 at 2; GE 3 at 1; GE 4 at 37; Tr. at 40-44, 66, 69, 73, 75-78, 86-88.)
By that point, Applicant had settled in a new career as a Navy contractor beginning
in November 2012. He no longer dreamed of working in law enforcement after his son
was born in September 2012 and his wife was unemployed. Nevertheless, he took the
CBP polygraph in July 2013. As set forth in the examiner’s Polygraph Report, Applicant
admitted during the examination that he used marijuana approximately 20 times between
2000 and August 2012. Accordingly, his first use was while in high school and his last use
was about one year before the polygraph. (GE 1 at 13; GE 2 at 2; GE 3 at 1; GE 4 at 37;
Tr. at 40-44, 66, 69, 73, 75-78, 86-88.)
Applicant  also  admitted  to  the  examiner  that  he  purchased  marijuana  on  about
three occasions. At the hearing, he provided no testimony disputing the accuracy of GE
3 with respect to this statement regarding purchasing marijuana. (GE 3 at 1.)
Applicant, however, disputes the accuracy of GE 3 on one critical point. He testified
that he told the examiner that he  only used marijuana during the period 2004 to 2005.
The examiner asked him to provide a range of the dates of use, and Applicant responded
with  this  range  just  so  that  he  would  “make  myself  look  better.  I  had  never  done  a
polygraph.” He testified that he subsequently received a letter from CBP stating that he
was “disqualified” for employment with that agency. While disappointed, he testified that
he was “in a better place” at the time he received the CBP letter. He had already started
working in his new career field. (GE 3 at 1; Tr. at 40-44, 60, 63-64, 66, 69, 75-79, 86-87.)
At  one  point  in  his  testimony,  described  above,  Applicant  said  that  he  never
inquired  about  the  CBP’s  reason  for  its  disqualification  decision.  (Tr.  at  60.)  He
subsequently testified that the disqualification letter advised him that  he was not being
considered  for  employment  at  CBP  because  he  did  not  initially  tell  the  truth  about  his
marijuana  use  on  his  2009  e-QIP.  (Tr.  at  76-77.)  The  letter  explained  further  that  he
admitted in his polygraph that his marijuana use was more extensive than three times in
2004,  which  is  what  he  disclosed  in  his  e-QIP.  In  his  testimony,  he  denied  that  the
disqualification letter referred to drug use as recent as 2012. Moreover, he denied ever
telling the examiner that his last use was in August 2012. He cannot explain why that date
appears in GE 3. The first time he saw GE 3 was after the issuance of the SOR when he
requested his investigative file. (GE 3 at 1; Tr. at 40-44, 60-64, 66, 68-69, 75-79, 86-87.)
Personal Conduct
The SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately omitted information in his 2017 SCA
relating to his use of marijuana. He answered, “No,” to a question in Section 23 regarding
drug use in the past seven years. The SOR alleges that he intentionally provided a false
response  to  this  question.  As  noted,  GE  3  evidences  that  Applicant  did  indeed  use
marijuana  in  the  prior  seven-year  period,  which  dates  back  to  2010.  At  the  hearing,
Applicant  testified  that,  other than  the  admission  relating to  marijuana,  the  admissions
summarized  in GE 3 were  accurate.  Applicant denies, however,  that GE 3  is accurate
with respect to the period of  time he admitted to using marijuana,  i.e., 2000 to August
2012. He claimed he only admitted using marijuana in 2004 to 2005, which was outside
of the reportable, seven-year period in the SCA. (Tr. at 39-40, 44, 64-66.)
Character Evidence
Applicant offered 15 character reference letters, his two most recent performance
evaluations from his current employer, and nine certifications of his training and a history
of his post-high school coursework. One letter is from a long-time friend and the others
are  from  current  and  former  supervisors,  co-workers,  and  subordinates.  Each  person
praises Applicant enthusiastically as a dedicated, highly trained, and skilled worker. They
believe  him  to  be  honest  and  trustworthy  and  a  person  of  integrity  and  character.
Applicant testified that only one of his references is aware of the Government’s security
concerns raised in the SOR. That person is his current supervisor. The supervisor’s letter
is one of Applicant’s strongest letters of recommendation. (AE B; Tr. at 70, 72.)
Applicant’s two  job  performance  evaluations praise his leadership skills, discuss
his promotion, and compliment his mentorship and training efforts. Applicant’s work team
has an excellent safety record because of his leadership. He exceeded expectations and
his performance was rated as “STRONG/OUTSTANDING.”(AE G; AE I.)
The  certificates  Applicant  presented  evidence  the  significant  amount  of  time
Applicant  has  invested  in  his  training  and  his  expertise  in  his  field.  They  support  his
employer’s view expressed in its annual performance evaluations of Applicant that he is
well trained in all aspects of his job, particularly in the critical area of safety. (AE I.)
