Applicant admitted  seven  of  the  SOR  allegations,  with  explanations  (SOR ¶¶  1.a-
1.d,  1.f,  1.h-1.i),  and   denied   two   allegations   (SOR  ¶¶   1.e,  1.g).   The   admissions  are
adopted  as  findings of fact.  After a  careful review  of the  pleadings and  evidence,  I make
the  following  additional  findings of fact.
Applicant is 43 years old. She has worked for a federal contractor since November
2018. She had a period of unemployment from May 2018 to November 2018. She served
on active duty in the U.S. Navy from 1996 to 2002, and was honorably discharged. She
then served in her state Army National Guard from 2003 until May 2018, when she was
medically retired  with  an  honorable  discharge.  She  received  her associate’s degree  in
2015. She is twice divorced, but remarried her second husband in February 2018 and
remains married to him. She has four children, ages 21, 20, 19, and 8. (Items 2, 3)
The  remaining  eight  delinquent  SOR  debts
total  approximately  $29,912
(Department Counsel withdrew SOR ¶ 1.e in her FORM submission and it will no longer
be considered). Applicant’s debts are established by credit reports from February 2020
and February 2019, her security clearance application (SCA) admissions, her admissions
to a defense investigator in May 2019, and her SOR admissions. (Items 2-6)
Applicant attributes her financial problems to her husband losing his job in 2013,
leaving her to be the family’s sole income earner and having to support four children. She
intends to pay her debts. (Item 3; AE C) The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
SOR  ¶  1.a-$16,475  charge  off.  This  is  an  auto  account  opened  in  September
2011 and was charged off in December 2013. In her SOR answer, Applicant admitted this
account  and  claimed  she  would  clear  up  this  debt  in  the  future  with  a  payment
arrangement. More recently, she admitted that she has yet to contact the creditor. This
debt is unresolved. (Item 2, 5; AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.b-$316 charge off. This is a utility account opened in April 2013, which
went delinquent in June 2015. Applicant admitted this account and claimed she has made
several attempts to contact the creditor without success. She will continue to make efforts
to resolve this debt. This debt is unresolved. (Items 2, 5; AE A)
SOR  ¶  1.c-$310  collection.  This  is  a  utility  account  opened  in  October  2018.
Applicant  admitted  this  account  and  documented  payment  in  May  2021.  This  debt  is
resolved. (Item 2, 6; AE A)
SOR  ¶  1.d-$7,785  charge  off.  This  is  a  vehicle  account  opened  in  June  2011,
which  was  charged  off  in  August  2013.  In  her  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  this
account  and  claimed  she  would  clear  up  this  debt  in  the  future  with  a  payment
arrangement.  More  recently,  she  stated  she  had  a  number  for  the  creditor  and  would
make  payment  arrangements  beginning  in  August  2021.  She  failed  to  provide  any
documentation corroborating her claims. This debt is unresolved. (Item 2, 5, AE A)
SOR  ¶  1.e-$2,224  collection.  This  allegation  was  withdrawn  by  Department
Counsel and is no longer in dispute.
SOR ¶ 1.f-$2,111 collection. This is an account with a financial institution that had
its last activity in November 2011 and was assigned to a collection service in September
2013. Applicant admitted this debt, and in her SOR answer stated that she would make
payment  arrangements  beginning  in  September  2020.  There  is  no  supporting
documentation that she made such payment arrangements at that time. More recently,
Applicant provided documentation showing that she reached a settlement on this debt,
whereby she was to make a payment in May 2021 of approximately $844 and a second
payment in June 2021 for the same amount. She did not provide documentation showing
that either of the payments were made. This debt is unresolved. (Items 2, 5; AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.g-$1,348 collection. This is an account with a loan company that had its
last  activity in  November 2012 and  was  assigned  to  a collection  service  in  September
2013.  Applicant  denied  this  debt,  claiming  she  was  the  victim  of  identity  theft.  She
provided no documentation supporting this claim. Now she states that she will pay this
debt when she completes the settlement for SOR ¶ 1.f. This debt is unresolved. (Items 2,
5; AE A)
SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i-$939; $628 collections. These two consumer accounts are
for the same creditor. Applicant presented documentation that both accounts were closed
in May 2021. These accounts are resolved. (Item 2; AE A)
Applicant  presented  a  copy  of  a  May  24,  2021  credit  report that  she  offered  as
proof that she has a good payment history. She hopes to have all her debts cleared up
by the end of 2022. She did not offer any monthly budgetary information or proof that she
sought financial counseling. (AE A).
