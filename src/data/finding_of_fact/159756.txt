Applicant is a 51 year-old system administrator data for a defense contractor who
seeks a security clearance.  The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted as
relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant married in April 1999, separated in August 2017, and divorced in April
2021. (GEs 1 and 4; Tr. 25-26, 29) He has no children from this marriage. He earned an
Associate’s degree in October 1991 and reported no military service. (GE 1)
Since  May  2015,  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  his  current  employer  as  a
system  administrator.  (GEs  1  and  3)  Previously,  he  worked  for  other  employers  as  a
security  system  specialist  working  at  various  levels  of  responsibility.  He  has  held  a
security clearance since 2009, and he has never had his security clearance revoked or
suspended. (GE 1)
Applicant’s finances
Applicant  and   his  ex-wife   bought  their   residence   in  August  2007   for  $601,000
and placed  a  first mortgage  on  the  property  for approximately  $531,720. (GE 4; Tr. 29,
31)   Also,   in  August  2007,  they   financed   their   home   purchase   with   a   $75,552   home
equity  loan, secured  by  a  second  mortgage  on  the  property. (GE 4; Tr. 30, 45-47)  The
loan   proceeds  from   this  loan   were  used   to   make   their   down   payment  ($60,000)  and
closing  costs.  (Tr. 33, 45-47) At the  time, Applicant was earning  approximately  $80,000
annually. (Tr. 29)
In  2012. Applicant’s spouse  was  diagnosed with a physical ailment that resulted
in  her  missing  a  lot  of  work  between  2013  and  2015  and  becoming  bedridden  for
several  months  in  2015,  and  an  inability  to  work.  (GE  2;  Tr.  27-28,  37-38)  After
exhausting her sick leave benefits, she was denied disability benefits. Unable to make
their  monthly  mortgage  payments  on  Applicant’s  salary  alone,  he  and  his  ex-spouse
defaulted  on  both  mortgages  In  2013,  they  downsized  to  another  residence,  and
voluntarily relinquished their home to their first mortgage lender in July 2015. (AE 3-4;
Tr. 37-40).
Sometime in 2016, the first mortgagee initiated foreclosure proceedings. (Tr. 39)
At  the  time  of  the  foreclosure,  Applicant  and  his  ex-spouse  owed  approximately
$450,000  on  their  first  mortgage  account  and  $75,082  on  their  second  mortgage
securing their home equity loan according to their most recent credit reports. (GEs 3-5)
Unclear is the sale price of Applicant’s foreclosed residence. Applicant was never
contacted  by  the  first  mortgagee  after  the  sale  to  confirm  the  sale  price  and  available
excess  proceeds  (if  any)  for  allocation  to  the  second  mortgage’s  outstanding  loan.
Afforded the opportunity to supplement the record with updated sale information on his
foreclosed residence, he did not do so. (Tr. 41-42, 50)
For  lack  of  information   from   either  the   first   mortgage   lender  or  Applicant,   no
independent assessments  can   be  made   as to   whether Applicant’s   home   equity   lender
was  ever  credited   with   excess  proceeds   from   the   foreclosure  sale.  The   only   available
documentation  of  any  liability  of  Applicant to  the  second  mortgage  holder on  his  home
equity   loan   (SOR  ¶   1.a)  is  the   detailed   delinquent  amount  in  the   2019-2020   credit
reports  placed  in evidence  by  the  Government  that   confirm  Applicant’s existing   liability
to   the   lender   in   the   amount   of  $78,082   (GEs  4-5;   Tr. 41,   45-50),   and   the   more   recent
2021  credit report documented  by  Applicant that  reveals no  amounts owing  to  creditor
SOR ¶  1.a. (AE  A) Without  the  sale and  loan  documentation  in evidence  to  cross-check
and   assess   any   credit  adjustments   in  the   SOR  1.a   debt,  fully   accurate   and   reliable
assessments of  the current status of the  cannot be made.  (Tr. 50-52)
Besides  his  delinquent  home  equity  loan,  Applicant  accrued  a  delinquent
consumer debt of $271. (GEs 3-5) This debt represents a medical account that became
delinquent in  2016 in  the  reported amount of  $271.  Applicant’s  most  recent  May  2021
credit  report  credited  Applicant  with  paying  off  the  account  in  full,  and  Applicant
confirmed his payoff of this debt. (AE A; Tr. 26)
Applicant  reported   a   current  net  monthly   income   of   $4,124.16.   (GE  3)  His
monthly  expenses total $3,400, which leaves him  with  a  monthly  remainder of  $728.16.
He claimed bank savings of  $4,000 and a car worth $19,000. (GE 3)
