Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the  pleadings,  including  Applicant’s  admissions  in  his  Answer  to  all  of  the  SOR
allegations,  his  testimony,  and  the  documentary  evidence  in  the  record,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 48 years old. He has two adult children from his first marriage in 1991.
He was divorced in 2003. He remarried in 2009 and has one adult stepchild. He and his
wife live in a home he has owned since 2007. He earned his high school diploma in 1991
and an associate’s degree from a technical institute in 1996. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy
following  his  high  school  graduation  and  served  for  four  year.  He  was  honorably
discharged in 1995 at the pay grade of E-3. He presently works as an avionics tech for a
DoD contractor. His wife works in a warehouse. (Tr. at 18-22, 32.)
In connection with his employment with DoD Contractor I, Applicant applied for and
was granted eligibility for a secret security clearance in 2016. He changed jobs to work
for DoD Contractor II in 2017. His current employer asked him to apply for a top secret
clearance. He submitted his SCA in November 2017. (Tr. at 7-8, 21-22.)
In November 2015, Applicant began to experience financial problems after he was
fired  from  his  job  at  Employer  A.  He  was  terminated  for  violating  company  policies
regarding computer usage. Employer A paid him a substantial hourly rate, and he was
given a significant amount of overtime while working there. As a result, his annual income
as an electrician was about $120,000 for about five years. He earned substantially less
at his next two jobs, Employer B and DoD Contractor I. When he moved from Employer
B to DOD Contractor I, his earnings increased to about $50,000 per year. He is presently
making about $75,000 per year working at DoD Contactor II. While working at Employer
A, he incurred significant credit-card debts and other debts, even though he made a good
income working there. He testified that he ran up debts on the five bank credit cards that
are the subject of the SOR allegations and another three cards that he paid off prior to
the issuance of the SOR. In addition, he incurred debts on three retail store cards. (Tr. at
10-11, 22-30, 40-42.)
After losing his job with Employer A and suffering a large reduction in his income,
Applicant was unable to continue paying his debts. He defaulted on all of the SOR debts.
He also had a vehicle repossessed. All of his credit cards were cancelled and turned over
to collection agencies. He was able to avoid foreclosure on his home mortgage, though
he got behind on his mortgage payments. He subsequently caught up and is now current
on his mortgage. He has cut back on his expenses to avoid incurring any new debt. (Tr.
at 30-45, 49.)
Applicant has not created a budget. He is hoping to negotiate lower amounts on
his debts so that he can begin to repay them. Some of the collection agencies have sent
him settlement plans. He would like to make better deals with his creditors. He is trying
to  avoid  filing  for  bankruptcy.  He  currently  has  about  $10,000  in  savings  and  about
$25,000 in his employer’s retirement plan. He has taken out a loan on the funds in the
retirement  account  to  pay  for  car  repairs.  He  has  worked  hard  to  avoid  creating  new
financial problems and intends to repay his debts as best as he can when he can in the
future. (Tr. at 30-45, 49.)
