Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  of  the  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  54-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with the defense contractor since March of 2019. (AppX 1 at pages 7 and 12.)
He  is  unmarried,  and  has  no  children.  (GX  1  at  page  18.)  Applicant  was  laid  off  and
unemployed for nearly three years, from about 2015 until 2019, when he moved in with
his ailing parents. (TR at page 14 line 20 to page 15 line 23, and GX 1 at page 13.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a.  Applicant  filed   for   the   protection   of   a   Chapter  7   bankruptcy   in  October  of
2018, as a   result   of  his  afore-mentioned   unemployment.   His  debts  were  discharged   in
March of  2019. (TR at  page 18 line  10 to page 19 line 13, and at page 30 lines 16~19.)
1.b.  It  is alleged  that Applicant  failed  to  file  his Federal income  tax  returns  for  tax
years 2014~2018. He has submitted  documentation  showing  he  has filed  for tax  years
2015,  2017   and   2018.   (TR  at  page   19   line   21   to   page   23   line   8,  at  page   24   line   1   to
page   26   line   11,   and   AppXs  A~C.)  Despite   having   two   additional  months   to   do   so,
Applicant has submitted  nothing  regarding  his  2014  and 2016  tax  filings. (TR at  page 30
line 20 to  page 31 line  17.)
1.c.  .  It  is  alleged  that Applicant failed  to  file  his state  income  tax  returns for tax
years 2014~2018. He has submitted  documentation  showing  he  has filed  for tax  years
2015,  2017   and   2018.   (TR  at  page   19   line   21   to   page   23   line   8,  at  page   24   line   1   to
page   26   line   11,   and   AppXs  A~C.)  Despite   having   two   additional  months   to   do   so,
Applicant  has submitted  nothing  regarding  his  2014  and 2016  tax  filings. (TR at  page 30
line 20 to  page 31 line  17.)
1.d. Applicant admits that he  owes $6,453  (AppX  E) to  the  Federal Government
in delinquent taxes. (TR  at page  23  lines  9~19, and  at page  26  line  12  to  page  27  line
22.)  Despite   having   two   additional  months   to   do   so,   Applicant  has  submitted   nothing
regarding this Federal tax delinquency. (TR at page  31 lines 18~23.)
1.e.  As  Applicant  has   submitted   documentation   (AppX   E)  showing   he   is  due   a
$12,771   refund   from   his  state,   I  find   no   $5,277   state   tax   delinquency.  (TR  at  page   23
line 20 to  page 27 line  22.) This allegation is found  for Applicant.
