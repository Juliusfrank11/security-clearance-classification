Applicant admitted six of the SOR allegations (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.g), and denied one
allegation (SOR ¶ 1.a). The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful
review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 25 years old. He has worked for a federal contractor since March 2019.
He  had  a  period  of  unemployment  from  February  2018  to  March  2018.  He  served  on
active duty in the U.S. Air Force from 2014 to 2017, and was honorably discharged. He
received his high school diploma in 2013 and he has since taken some college courses.
He married in 2014 and has two children. (Item 4; AE B)
The  seven  delinquent  SOR  debts  total  approximately  $36,000.  The  debts  are
comprised  of  collection  accounts  and  charged-off  accounts  (auto  repossession,  credit
card,  consumer  debt,  and  medical  debts).  The  debts  are  established  by  credit  reports
from March 2021 and February 2020, and his SOR admissions. (Items 3, 6-7)
Applicant  attributes  his  financial  problems  to  being  furloughed  from  his  job  in
October 2019. While he secured another job in January 2020, he was unable to pay his
bills, because his wife lost her job in April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. (Item 3;
AE C)
The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a-$25,484 charge off. This is an auto account opened in June 2018. In
his SOR answer, Applicant denied this debt claiming that he recently made a payment
and that the debt should be current. If it was not, he promised to make arrangements to
satisfy the debt. He did not provide any documentation showing that he made a payment,
that  the  debt  is  now  current,  or  that  he  contacted  the  creditor  about  making  payment
arrangements. His March 2021 credit report still shows the debt as a charged-off account.
This debt is unresolved. (Items 3, 7)
SOR ¶ 1.b-$6,696 charge off. This is an account with a financial institution opened
in April 2017, which went delinquent in August 2017. Applicant admitted this account and
stated  that he planned to have this account settled by the end  of  the  year. He did not
provide  any documentation showing what  efforts he has made to settle this debt.  This
debt is unresolved. (Items 3, 7)
SOR ¶ 1.c-$652 charge off. This is an account with a financial institution opened
in  August  2014,  which  went  delinquent  in  2017.  Applicant  stated  that  he  planned  to
resolve this debt in the next three to five months. He did not provide any documentation
showing what efforts he has made to settle this debt. This debt is unresolved. (Items 3,
7; AE C)
SOR  ¶  1.d-$59  charge  off.  Applicant  admitted  this  debt  and  provided
documentation showing that he paid the debt in March 2021. This debt is resolved. (Item
3, AE C-D)
SOR ¶ 1.e-$372 collection. This is a medical debt opened in April 2018, which
went delinquent in June 2018. Applicant claimed he paid this debt, but has not received
a receipt from the creditor. The debt does not appear on his March 2021 credit report.
This debt is resolved. (Items 3, 7; AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.f-$2,706 charge off. This is an account with a financial institution opened
in June 2017, which went delinquent in December 2017. Applicant admitted this debt. He
contacted the creditor and was told the debt had been cancelled and received a Form
1099-C from the creditor showing the debt was discharged for tax year 2018. This debt
is resolved. (Items 3, 7; AE C, E)
SOR ¶ 1.g-$65 charge off. This is an account with a financial institution opened
in  May  2017,  which  went  delinquent  in  April  2019.  Applicant  admitted  this  debt.  He
claimed he contacted the creditor and was referred to a third-party collector. He attempted
to make telephone contact with the collector, but has been unsuccessful so far. This debt
is unresolved. (Items 3, 6; AE C)
Applicant stated that his current financial status is in good shape. He claimed  to
have approximately $1,200 of disposable income at the end of each month after paying
all his expenses. He claimed to have $2,500 in savings. No documentation was supplied
to support these assertions. A recent credit report listed three new delinquent debts. He
also  claimed  his  peers  at  work  would  describe  him  as  “a  trustworthy,  responsible,
hardworking family man.” He did not provide any documents from said peers. (AE C).
