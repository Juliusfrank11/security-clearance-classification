Applicant partly admitted and denied the remaining SOR allegation in ¶ 1.g. After
a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is  58  years old.  He  attended  college, but  did  not  earn  a  degree. He  was
married  from  1991  to  2006  and  has  an  adult  child  from  the  marriage. He  served  in  the
Army  National Guard and  the  Army  Reserve  from  1985  to  2013. He  received  an  honorable
discharge. He  has  worked  for a  federal contractor since  2017  and  other  periods in  the
past. (Tr. 20-22; GE 1)
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  in  February  2017.
Question 26 asked if in the past seven years had he failed to file or pay Federal, state, or
local taxes as required by law. He stated “yes” and disclosed he failed to file and pay his
2007 Federal income tax returns. He stated:
While  doing  this  SF  86  I  found  out  that  I  have  not  filed  taxes  and  I  owe
Federal taxes. I did file while in Iraq and they were mailed by the company
that was on base that prepared them. I am owed over [$]6000 and I signed
that over to the US Government because I knew I was going to owe. (GE 1)
Applicant  also  disclosed  in  the  SCA  that  he  believes  the  amount  he  owed  for
Federal income taxes for 2007 was $7,000. In addition, he stated “I am just finding some
of this out and will be working with the IRS or getting an attorney to assist this situation.”
(GE 1)
Applicant also disclosed  in the SCA that he failed to file his Federal income tax
return for tax year 2010. He stated the reason he failed to file was because he “did not
have the money due to unemployment to file or pay.” He estimated he owed about $1,000.
He also stated: “I actually think I am owed a refund for that year but just found out [about]
this.” (GE 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  Government  investigator  in  September  2017.
During his interview his tax issues were discussed. He told the investigator that in early
2017, he was notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that he owed approximately
$6,000 or $7,000 in federal income taxes for tax year 2006 and approximately $1,000 for
tax year 2010. He inadvertently disclosed on his SCA that he failed to file and pay taxes
for  tax  year  2007.  That  was  incorrect  and  it  should  have  been  2006.  He  told  the
investigator that the IRS indicated that he had not filed his 2006 return. He believed he
had filed it while he was deployed to Iraq, but could not recall the date. Through a military
program at the base, those serving as contractors and military personnel were provided
a service for assisting them in filing their tax returns, but they were responsible for mailing
them. He stated to the investigator that he had a refund owed to him of approximately
$6,000, and he elected to have it applied to his next year’s tax return as he expected he
would owe taxes the following year. He said he was never contacted by the IRS until 2017
and was unaware that the 2006 return was not filed. He asked the IRS what he could do
and was advised to pay 20% of the balance owed, which would be a payment of $1,000
each month. He could not afford this payment. He told the investigator the IRS would not
accept smaller payments. He said that he was in the process of resolving the issue. He
said that the majority of his archived files were in storage, but he intended to retrieve all
of the files and documentation in order to file his tax returns. He intended to try and have
the issue resolved by the end of 2017. He believed that once the late return was filed, he
anticipated having a refund which would counterbalance what is being identified as owed
by the IRS. If he owed taxes, he intended to set up a payment plan with the IRS to ensure
the amount was paid. (GE 2)
At  his  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  was  due  a  refund  for  tax  year  2006
because  he  had  been  overseas,  and  he  used  the  IRS  “preliminary  check  service”  to
forecast that he would receive a $6,000 refund. He wanted this prospective refund applied
to  his  2007  income  taxes.  He  said  he  was  advised  that  the  overseas  tax  benefit  only
applied if one was out of the country for 335 days, and it was not prorated. He believed
he would owe taxes in 2007, so this is why he chose to have his 2006 refund applied to
his 2007 taxes. He explained that he believed he had an extra year to file if he was out of
the country and owed taxes and three years if he was due a refund. He said he filed his
2006 tax return. It was determined he filed his 2006 tax return in August 2008. He said
the IRS never received his 2006 income tax return. He did not keep a copy of the return
because it was past seven years. In 2019, he was on notice that his hearing was to be
scheduled sometime after October 2019, when he returned from overseas. He said he
tried contacting the IRS for a copy of the return, but was unsuccessful. He stated that he
had saved all of his returns, but he destroyed them after seven years and the statute of
limitations had run. (Tr. 28-41 49-61)
Regarding  Applicant’s  2010  federal  income  tax  return,  he  told  the  government
investigator that he was aware he owed about $1,000 before being contacted by the IRS.
He was unemployed for a period during that year and was not able to pay the taxes owed
due to other financial obligations. He put this debt on the “back burner” and had not paid
it.  He  intended to  resolve  it  along with  the  2006 tax issue.  He intended  to resolve  this
issue and pay what he owed by the end of 2017. (GE 2)
At his hearing, Applicant testified that he could not verify the date he had filed his
2010 tax return. He said it was a mistake when he said he had not filed, but rather he had
filed, but cannot prove it. He could not recall if he had filed before his 2017 interview or
after  it.  He  then  said  he  filed  it  when  he  returned  to  the  country  in  2011,  but  the  IRS
informed him right before his 2017 interview that it did not have his 2010 tax return, and
he  needed to file again.  He  said  he  tried to file again,  but  the  IRS would  not accept  it
because the statute of limitations had run. He said he was told by the IRS that “we don’t
need them, they already assessed.” (Tr. 40-42) He said he then re-filed sometime in 2018.
He  did  not  save  any  of  this  information  because  he  said  it  was  past  the  statute  of
limitations.  He  testified  that  he  was  unaware  he  owed  taxes  for  2010  until  he  was
interviewed  by  the  government  investigator  in  2017.  This  is  inconsistent  with  his
disclosures in his SCA. (Tr. 39-48, 56, 58-61; GE 2)
Applicant told the investigator that he wanted to focus on resolving his federal tax
debt with the IRS before addressing other debts that he had at the time. He volunteered
to work overseas so he could increase his income and use the money to resolve his debts.
(GE 2)
Applicant testified that he contacted the IRS in June 2021 and was told that the
statute of limitations had run on the tax years in question. He said that the IRS was able
to confirm that he filed his Federal income tax returns for tax year 2006 in 2008, but it
would take ten week for him to receive the transcript from the IRS. The IRS was unable
to confirm he had filed his 2010 return. He stated: “They also have no record I didn’t file.”
He further stated: “I tried  to  file, and follow the  rules,  and  they said that they could not
accept them, because it was too late.” He then stated he could not remember what tax
service he used to file the return, but was told when it attempted to file electronically the
return was kicked back. (Tr. 52-54, 58, AE G)
Post-hearing Applicant provided a copy of the 2006 Federal income tax transcript
that  was  requested  on  June  10,  2021  and  the  response  date  was  the  same.  The
transcripts shows his 2006 return was filed in August 2008 and he owed $7,814. Penalties
and interest were added. His 2007 federal tax refund was applied to the  2006 balance
owed. The transcript notes that a “collection due process notice of intent to levy –return
receipt signed” was issued on November 13, 2008. Five payments of $55 were collected
from  April  2009  to  June  2009.  It  is  unknown  if  these  payments  were  from  a  levy  or  if
Applicant voluntarily made them. Additional penalties and interest were added over the
years. In 2016 the account was still deemed collectible. The last entry was September
17,  2017,  stating  “Write-off  balance  due  $7,267.”  Applicant  failed  to  timely  his  2006
federal income tax return as noted on the transcript. (AE O)
The SOR does not allege Applicant failed to pay his 2006 or 2010 federal income
taxes. It only alleges he failed to timely file the returns. His failure to pay his taxes and
any reference to delinquent tax debts will not be considered for disqualifying purposes,
but  may  be  considered  when  analyzing  the  whole-person,  in  making  a  credibility
determination, and in mitigation.
Applicant testified that because of his divorce in 2006 there was some confusion
about who would file the tax return that year. He further testified that he had an automatic
extension  to  file  his  2010  federal  tax  return  because  he  was  working  as  a  contractor
overseas. He said he filed the return, but the IRS had no record. He said he throws his
paperwork out after seven years. He included a document from the IRS to show he does
not have a balance owed for tax years 2018 through 2021. It did not show if he timely
filed his 2010 federal tax return. He indicated that the statute of limitations had run on his
2010 tax returns, which may or may not be true, but it is irrelevant regarding whether he
timely filed his tax returns for purposes of his security clearance eligibility. He stated that
the documents show he does not owe anything to the IRS, and it would have withheld
refunds. This may be accurate, but speculative. If he filed on time and owed money, future
refunds could be applied to a balance owed. The fact he has no balance for 2018 to 2020,
does not show that he filed his 2010 tax return on time. He failed to provide a  credible
explanation for the contradictory statements he made on his SCA and to the government
investigator. He testified that the IRS “don’t have any records of 2010 whatsoever,” which
corroborates  either  they  were  not  filed  or they  were  lost.  Back  in  2017,  Applicant  was
going to contact the IRS and resolve the matter. Four years have passed since then and
now he states he cannot retrieve the documents because they are older than ten years.
(Tr. 25-29, 62-63)
Applicant failed to provide the tax transcript for 2010. He provided a document from
the IRS to show years the transcripts are available. The document he provided from 2021
shows transcripts were available for tax years 2011 to 2021, the past ten years. He did
not  provide  an  explanation  for  why  he  could  request  and  receive  in  June  2021  the
computer generated 2006 transcript and not the 2010 transcript. He explained in a written
statement that he was told by two tax professionals that if he used the paper Form 4506
to request the 2010 tax transcript he would not receive it by the date the record closed.
Applicant did not explain why he failed to resolve the issue in 2017, as he stated he would
and when it was within the ten years. (AE D, F)
Applicant provided a copy of  a 1040 Federal income tax form for tax year 2010
that he signed on June 18, 2021. It reflects an adjusted gross income of $143,756 and
tax owed of $5,109. He provided receipts to show he mailed the return on June 18, 2021.
(AE J, K, N, M)
In his post-hearing statement, Applicant said he found his working folder of all his
W-2s and receipts for 2010. He did not indicate he had a copy of the 2010 tax return. His
accountant recommended he “re-file” the 2010 tax return. He expected the IRS to “either
thank me for my submission of my 2010 taxes or send me a  letter acknowledging that
they already have my 2010 filing.” (AE I)
Applicant testified: “To the best of my knowledge, I have done everything to comply
with  everything  I’ve  ever done  with  the  IRS, and  with  the  deployments,  and  being, the
stuff  I’ve  gone  through, I have  filed  everything, and  I will do  what  it takes to  prove  that
with the extension.” (Tr. 67) This statement contradicts the 2006 tax transcript that shows
Applicant failed to timely file and pay the amount of tax owed for 2006 and it was written
off by the IRS in 2018 as unpaid.
Applicant’s testimony contradicted his disclosures in his SCA, his statement to the
government investigator, and the 2006 tax transcript. I did not find Applicant’s testimony
credible.
Applicant  provided  character  letters.  In  them  he  is  described  as  an  outstanding
individual  with  the  highest  morality  and  personal  integrity.  He  is  trusted,  professional,
competent,  reliable,  faithful,  methodical,  dedicated,  patriotic  and  considered  worthy  of
protecting classified information. He follows procedures and protocols. (AE A, B, D, H, L)
