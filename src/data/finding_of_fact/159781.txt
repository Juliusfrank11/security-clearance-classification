Applicant  is  a   51-year-old  prospective   employee   of   a  defense   contractor.  He
worked   for  the   company   overseas,  but   because   of  the   COVID-19   pandemic,  he   was
unable to  return after a  visit home. He will be  rehired  if  he  receives a  security  clearance.
He  is applying for a  security  clearance for  the first time. He  has a master’s degree.  He is
married with two  children.  (Transcript (Tr.) at 34;  GE 1)
Applicant was born in  Egypt. He  immigrated  to  the  United  States in  1992,  and  he
became  a  U.S. citizen  in 2008.  Most of  his Egyptian  family  moved  to  the  United  States,
including   his  brother  who   retired   from   the   U.S.  military   and   his  widowed   mother   who
lives with  him.  He  has a  half-brother who  is a  citizen  and  resident  of Egypt.  Applicant  is
not close  to  his half-brother, and  has not seen  him  in years. His mother used  to  own  an
apartment in Egypt, valued  at about $33,200, which  she  used  when  she  visited  Egypt,
but  she   sold  the   property.   Applicant   proclaimed   his undivided   allegiance   to   the   United
States: “America is my country.”  (Tr. at 20-21; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1)
Applicant   invested   in  a   permit  (medallion)  for  a   taxicab   in   a   major  U.S.  city   in
about  2007.  The   cost   of   the   medallion   was  paid  through   a   down   payment  of   about
$32,000, and  a  secured  loan,  with  monthly  payments  of more  than  $2,000.  There are a
limited   amount   of  medallions   authorized   for   the   city,  and   the   costs  of  the   medallions
increased  dramatically  until it became  a  “bubble.” The  city  changed  the  way  it regulated
taxicabs;   Applicant’s  business  was  unsuccessful;  and   the   “bubble”  burst;   leaving
Applicant  with   a   medallion   valued   at  a   fraction   of  what  he   paid   for  it,   and   numerous
debts  that  he  incurred  attempting  to  keep  his  taxi business  afloat. The  predatory  lending
practices associated  with  the  loans for the  medallions became  the  subject  of  a  federal
investigation.  Applicant  moved  to  another state  in  2013  for a  fresh  start.  (Tr. at 22, 35-

The  SOR alleges  23  delinquent debts with  balances  totaling  about  $39,000,  and
a   $3,849   judgment   that  was  awarded   in   2011.  Almost   all   of  the   debts  became
delinquent   before  2013.  Applicant admitted   that  he   owed   all   of  the   debts   at one  point.
He paid in  full  the  debts  in SOR ¶¶ 1.a  ($1,136) and  1.b  ($500), with  a  final payment of
$232  in October 2020.  He also settled  and  paid the  $439  debt  in SOR ¶ 1.d,  with  a  final
payment  in  July   2019.   He  stated   that  he   paid  the   $709   debt   in  SOR  ¶  1.l.  He  did  not
provide documentation of the  payment, but the March 2020 credit report lists an account
with   the   original  creditor  as  paid   and   closed,  with   a   $0   balance.  (Tr.  at   29,  32;
Applicant’s response  to SOR; GE  1-5; AE B, D)
Applicant attempted  to  contact a  number of  the  creditors for the  debts alleged  in
the  SOR, but they  were nonresponsive. The  debts were reported  on  a  June  2017  credit
report, but none  of the  debts are listed  on  any  credit report after that.  Applicant’s current
credit reports show  no  delinquent debts. Several of  the  creditors have  issued  him  new
credit. Applicant’s current finances are stable,  with  no  new  delinquent debts  accrued  in
years.  (Tr. at 22-23, 29-33, 36, 41; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE  4, 5; AE  B, C)
Applicant   worked   overseas  as  a   linguist  in  support  of   the   U.S.  military.  He  was
unable  to   return after a   visit  home  because  of   the   COVID-19   pandemic.  He  submitted
documents  and
remarkable
professionalism.  He   was  described   by   a   U.S.  military   officer  as  “an   exceptional  team
player and  extremely reliable.”  (Tr. at 22, 35; AE E-H)
