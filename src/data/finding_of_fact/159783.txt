Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  –  1.e,  with  explanations.  I  adopt  Applicant’s
admissions as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.
Background Information
Applicant  is  a   47-year-old  lead   systems  engineer  for  integration   and   test,  who
has been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor since  November 2020. Before that,  he  was
working   as  a   subcontractor for the   same  employer.  He   currently   has  a   Secret  security
clearance; however, he  seeks to  reinstate  a  Top  Secret security  clearance  he  held  until
recently.  He  is  required   to   have   a   Secret   security   clearance   to   maintain   his  current
position. (Tr. 22-24; GE 1, GE 2)
Applicant graduated  from  high  school in June  1992. He was awarded  a  bachelor
of  arts degree  in history  in May  1996. He is “halfway” towards completion  of  a  master of
business  administration   degree.   (GE  1;  Tr.  24-25)   He  served   in  the   U.S.  Army   from
September  1999   to   July   2010,  and   received   a   general   discharge   under  honorable
conditions. The  Army  Review  Board ordered  that Applicant be  separated  from  the  Army
for  misconduct after  determining  that he  had  engaged  in  an  adulterous affair. Applicant
was  a   scout   pilot   (military   occupational  specialty   152DI),  and   held   the   rank  of  chief
warrant  officer  3   at  the   time   of   his  separation.  (Tr.  25-26)  He  has  a   100%  Veterans
Affairs (VA)  disability  rating  based  on  severe nerve  damage  in his lower back and  lower
neck  following   two   helicopter   crashes,   and   he   suffers   from   post-traumatic   stress
disorder (Tr. 60; GE 2; AE I)
Applicant  has  been   married   five   times,  with   his  first  four  marriages  ending   by
divorce. He married  his current spouse  in March 2017, and  she  is not employed  outside
the   home.  He  has  two   biological  children,  an   adult  son   and   a   minor  daughter,  from
previous  marriages.  Applicant   pays  $600   per  month   in  child   support  for  his  adult   son.
His minor daughter resides with  him,  as well  as a  minor stepdaughter.  (Tr. 27-29; GE  1,
GE 2)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s  SOR  lists  five  allegations,  one  Chapter  7  bankruptcy filed  in  August
2011 and discharged in February 2012, and four delinquent debts totaling $76,491. The
allegations  are  established  by  his  April  10,  2018  SF-86;  his  September  25,  2019  and
October  21,  2019  DOHA  Interrogatories;  his  January  10,  2020  SOR  Answer;  and  his
May 26, 2018, June 25, 2019, October 21, 2019, and January 10, 2021  credit reports.
(GE  1-7;  SOR  Answer)  Applicant  attributes  his  financial  difficulties  to  a  well-
documented very contentious divorce from his fourth wife. (Tr. 59; GE 2)
The following is a summary of Applicant’s SOR allegations to include his Chapter
7 bankruptcy, four debts, and their status:
SOR ¶  1.a  –  Chapter 7 bankruptcy, filed in  August 2011 and discharged in
February  2012.  Applicant  filed  Chapter  7,  while  married  to  his  fourth  wife.  He  had
incurred  debt  while  married  to  his third  wife,  and  his  fourth  wife  at  the  time  told  him  it
“would be an easy way to  get out of the financial responsibility.” He was married to his
fourth  wife  from  August  2010  to  December  2015.  The  fallout  from  that  marriage  is
discussed  below.  He  added  that  he  regrets  having  filed  bankruptcy  and  accepts  full
responsibility for filing. Applicant said his bankruptcy debt, “was pretty much about credit
cards and a boat.” He owed approximately $100,000 on the boat and $20,000 in credit
card  debt.  He  estimated  the  value  of  his  boat  was  only  $30,000  because  the  boat
market  had  “tanked”  in  2011.  The  amount  of  debt  discharged  by  bankruptcy  was
approximately $150,000. Additionally, after the Army discharged him in 2010, he took a
job in his current state of residence, which was different from the boat’s location, and he
could not afford to move the boat. (Tr. 31-37; GE 1, GE 2)
SOR  ¶   1.b   –   Charged-off  Harley  Davidson  motorcycle  account  in  the
amount  of  $14,453.  Applicant  and  his  fourth  wife  bought  the  motorcycle  together  in
December  2012.  On  March  14,  2015,  Applicant  was  involved  in  an  accident  with  the
motorcycle.  Applicant  took  the  motorcycle  to  a  body  shop  for  a  repair  estimate.  He
received  payment  of  $8,493  from his  insurance  company  to  repair the  motorcycle.  On
April 16, 2015, Applicant went to the body shop with the insurance check where his wife
met  him  and  confronted  him.  Applicant  described  what  happened,  “Long  story  short,
basically, (then wife) punched me in the face and then took a wrench to the motorcycle.”
After  this  incident,  Applicant  did  not  pay  the  body  shop  after  his  wife  “destroyed  that
motorcycle”  in  the  body  shop.  Applicant  reported  the  incident  to  the  police.  The  body
shop refused to return the motorcycle to Applicant. Applicant understands that the body
shop  owner  removed  the  engine  from  his  motorcycle  to  replace  the  engine  in  his
motorcycle. (Tr. 37-41, 64-68; GE 2)
This  account  had  its  “first  major  delinquency  on  October  1,  2015.”  Applicant
stopped making payments on the motorcycle because his then wife “wrecked it beyond
belief  to  where  [he]  couldn’t  do  anything  with  it.”  Numerous  photographs  in  the  record
document the motorcycle damage. Applicant added that he gave her the house, the car,
and  the  motorcycle  when  they  separated.  The  insurance  company  informed  Applicant
that  they  would  not  cover  the  intentional  damage  his  wife  caused  to  the  motorcycle.
When  Applicant  and  his  then  wife  separated,  he  agreed  to  continue  making  the
motorcycle payments; however, after she damaged the motorcycle, he ceased making
those  payments.  Applicant  deposited  the  insurance  check  into  his  account.  Today  he
regrets  that  he  stopped  making  payments  on  the  motorcycle  and  if  he  had  to  do  over
again,  he  would  have  worked  out  an  arrangement  with  Harley  Davidson.  Applicant
stated after the  account was charged  off, he  “did  not know  the  right way to  go.”  In his
September  25,  2019  Response  to  DOHA  Interrogatories,  he  stated  that  he  began
making  $50  monthly  payments  to  Harley  Davidson  in  September  2019  because  his
employer security personnel at the time suggested that he begin making $50 payments
to  Harley  Davidson  to  show  good  faith.  He  made  his  last  $50  payment  to  Harley
Davidson  in  February  2020.  Per  Applicant’s  August  8,  2020  credit  report,  Harley
Davidson wrote off the unpaid balance as a loss by credit grantor and charged off the
account to profit and loss. He has “no idea where the motorcycle is.” (SOR Answer; Tr.
38-43; 67-70, 78-81, 83; GE 2, GE 4; AE B)
Post-hearing, Applicant submitted through counsel an affidavit wherein he stated
that he contacted Harley Davidson by telephone on January 12, 2021. Before that, he
believed his account was settled as it was “charged off” based on his credit report, and
Harley  Davidson  made  no  further  attempts  to  contact  him.  Harley  Davidson  informed
him  during  that  telephone  call  that  his  account  was  still  open,  and  they  were  seeking
payment. Harley Davidson agreed to settle the account for the lesser amount of $7,250,
which  Applicant  paid. Applicant  provided documentation that  that he  remitted payment
to Harley Davidson on January 20, 2021. (Tr. 85-86; GE 2; AE B, AE G) Debt resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.c  –   Delinquent  account  for  repossessed  Dodge  Caravan
automobile in the amount $14,890. Applicant and his fourth wife jointly purchased this
vehicle.  When  they  separated,  his  wife  requested  that  she  be  allowed  to  have  the
vehicle because she had three of her own children in addition to their minor daughter.
Applicant agreed, and they made an informal agreement that she could keep the vehicle
with the understanding that she would make the $400 monthly payments. She failed to
make  the  payments  as  agreed,  and  the  vehicle  was  repossessed.  Applicant  did  not
have access to the vehicle, and he stated had he known the account was delinquent, he
would have made the payments on it. (Tr. 43-47; GE 2)
When   Applicant   and   his  wife   were  together,  they   were  both   responsible   for
making   the   payments   on   the   Dodge.  Applicant  made   the   monthly   payment  on   the
vehicle  until April 2015, and he  later  made  $50 monthly  payments from  September  2019
to   March  2020.  (Tr.  70-72;  GE   2)   Applicant’s  August  9,  2020   credit  report  states,
“ACCOUNT   LEGALLY   PAID  IN  FULL   FOR  LESS   THAN  THE   FULL   BALANCE;
ACCOUNT   PAID  IN   FULL;  DATE   FIRST   MAJOR  DELINQUENCY   REPORTED
10/01/2015.  UNPAID  BALANCE   REPORTED  AS   A   LOSS   BY   CREDIT  GRANTOR;
ACCOUNT   PAID  FOR   LESS  THAN FULL   BALANCE; SETTLEMENT   ACCEPTED  ON
THIS   ACCOUNT;  DISPUTE   RESOLVED-CONSUMER  DISAGREES;  PAID  CHARGE
OFF.” (Tr. 78-80, 83-84, 85-86; GE  2, GE 4;  AE B)
Post-hearing, Applicant submitted  through  counsel an  affidavit wherein  he  stated
that  he   initially   believed   this  account  had   been   settled   based   on   his  credit  report.
However, on further investigation, he discovered that the creditor sent him  a Form  1099-
C. Applicant  submitted  a  copy  of  his 2019  IRS  Wage  and  Income  Tax  Transcript,  which
lists  cancellation  of  this  debt in the  amount of  $14,790  (Form  1099-C)  as income  on  his
federal  income   tax   return.   Also  attached   was  a   receipt   dated   September  4,  2019,   for
payment of  his taxes for tax year 2019. (GE  2; AE H) Debt  resolved.
SOR ¶  1.d  –  Delinquent home mortgage account with a deficiency balance
of  $45,980.  Applicant  and  his  fourth  wife  jointly  purchased  this  house  in  June  2014.
When  Applicant  and  his  wife  separated  in  March  2015,  they  agreed  that  she  and  the
children  would  remain  in  the  home  with  the  understanding  that  she  would  make  the
$1,750 monthly mortgage  payment  with  the  $5,000 monthly child support and alimony
he was paying her by allotment. She failed to make the payments as agreed. Applicant
stated that the family law judge who heard their case told his wife that she should sell
the  house  if  she  was  not  going  to  make  the  mortgage  payments.  Applicant’s  wife
refused  to  cooperate  in  showing  the  house  and  managed  to  remain  in  the  house  for
about three years until she was evicted. (GE 2; Tr. 47-50)
Applicant  made  the  house  payments  through  April  2015.  He  informed  his  wife
after  paying  her  $5,000  in  monthly  spousal  and  child  support,  he  did  not  have  the
money to continue making the house payments. After he made the April 2015 mortgage
payment,  Applicant  stated  that  his  wife  verbally  agreed  to  make  the  house  payments
thereafter.  Applicant’s  attorney  did  not  itemize  the  marital  debt  in  their  divorce  decree
leaving the debts in question “still open.” (GE 2; Tr. 50-53)
Applicant stated that the family law judge told his wife that she could stay in the
home if she could get a loan. She was unable to get a loan and filed bankruptcy “four or
five  times” to  extend her stay in the home without paying.  Per the December 23, 2015
family  court  minutes,  the  Court  found  that  there  was  “urgency”  to  sell  the  house.
Applicant  was  to  choose  a  realtor  by  January  11,  2016.  Applicant  complied  with  the
court  order;  however,  his  wife  refused  to  let  the  realtor  in  the  house.  Failing  that,  the
Court ordered Applicant to pay the house payment out of spousal support and give the
remainder  to  his  wife.  Applicant  did  not  do  that  and  “ended  up  giving  her  all  of  the
money.” The house was foreclosed on June 23, 2017, and sold on December 21, 2017.
(Tr. 72-75, 79-80)
Applicant’s  August 9,  2020  credit  report  states,  “FORECLOSRE,  COLLATERAL
SOLD;  ACCOUNT  DELINQUENT  180  DAYS  PAST  DUE;  DATE  FIRST  MAJOR
DELINQUENCY  REPORTED:  05/01/2020;  CREDIT  GRANTOR  RECLAIMED
COLLATERAL  TO  SETTLE  DEFAULTED  MORTGAGE;  .  .  .”  (Tr.  80-82;  AE  B)  In
Applicant’s state  of  residence, lenders are not allowed to pursue  deficiency judgments
following  nonjudicial  foreclosures.  Hence,  the  debt  is  considered  to  be  satisfied  by
operation of law. (GE 2; Tr. 79-80, 82) Debt resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.e   –   Collection  account  for  a  cell  phone  in  the  amount  of  $1,168.
Applicant stated that his fourth wife “took all the phones that [she] and I had purchased.”
She had agreed to place the cell phone accounts in her name and make the payments
on  those  phones.  She  failed  to  follow  through  on  her  commitment,  and  the  creditor
turned  to  the  Applicant  for  payment.  He  settled,  and  paid  the  account  for  the  lesser
amount of $292. Applicant submitted documentation from the creditor  that he paid this
amount on December 31, 2019. (SOR Answer; GE 2; Tr. 53-54) Debt resolved.
Applicant  stated  that  he  stopped  paying  his  joint  debts  that  accrued  during  his
fourth  marriage  because  his  former  wife  was  “getting  over”  by  “getting  basically  [his]
entire paycheck.”  (Tr. 75)
During his hearing, Applicant discussed his assets and expenses. Post-hearing,
he submitted a budget that corroborated that he maintains a modest lifestyle and lives
within his means. According to Applicant’s budget, his joint annual income is $143,232.
His total monthly joint income is $11,936 (non-taxable VA disability payment of $3,736,
joint income of $6,800, wife’s child support of $1,400) and after paying all of his bills, he
has a net monthly remainder of $4,542. (Tr. 58-59, 61; AE B, AE C, AE I) Applicant is
current on his child support payments to his former spouse. (Tr. 62; AE I)
Since remarrying, Applicant has not experienced any of the financial issues  that
he experienced during his fourth marriage. (Tr. 59) His credit has improved to the point
where he was able to qualify for a home loan of $340,600 in 2020. To avoid making the
mistakes he made while married to his fourth wife, Applicant has the house, his car, and
his motorcycle loans in his name, and the loan for his wife’s car is in her name. (Tr. 75,
78;  AE  A)  His  January  10,  2021  credit  report  does  not  reflect  any  past-due  accounts.
(GE 7)
Character Evidence
A  co-worker,  employed  as  a  field  services  representative  (FSR),  with  the  same
company as Applicant, testified on his behalf. FSR has been employed since June 2019
and  holds  a  security  clearance.  FSR  maintains  a  close  working  relationship  with
Applicant  and  interacts  with  him  on  a  daily  basis.  He  described  Applicant  as  a  good
worker, leader, and mentor, as well as being trustworthy. FSR has no reason to believe
that  Applicant  would  be  a  security  risk.  (Tr.  14-21)  Applicant  submitted  two  character
letters,  from  a  retired  U.S.  Army  sergeant  first  class  (SFC)  and  from  his  current  wife.
SFC has known Applicant for 13 years. He lauded Applicant’s dedication as a husband,
father, and employee. He attested to Applicant’s trustworthiness and willingness to help
those  in  need  within his community. Applicant’s wife  has  known  him  for over six  years
and described him as her best friend. She spoke in glowing terms of his dedication as a
spouse,  father,  stepfather,  and  provider.  His  wife  also  reiterated  what  SFC  said
regarding his trustworthiness and willingness to help those in the community. (AE G, AE
H)

2007  to  July  2008; (2)  in Iraq  from  July  2003  to  July  2004; and  (3) in Afghanistan  from
November 2009  to  July  2010. (Tr. 61; GE  2; AE  D, AE  E) Applicant  is no  longer able to
fly helicopters due to back injuries received  on active duty. (Tr. 61-62)
Applicant  submitted  a  signed  Classified  Information  Nondisclosure  Agreement
between  himself  and  the  United  States  dated  December  10,  2020.  He  signed  that
agreement  when  he  received  his  Top  Secret  security  clearance.  He  takes  his
obligations  to  protect  classified  information  seriously  and  intends  to  uphold  his
obligation to the United States. Applicant has never had a security violation in 21 years.
(Tr.  62-64;  AE  F)  Apart  from  an  incident  and  adulterous  behavior  that  led  up  to  his
administrative  separation  from  the  Army  with  a  general  discharge  under  honorable
conditions  in  July  2010,  his  service  record  documented  an  otherwise  stellar  and
honorable career. (GE 1, GE 2, GE 3)
