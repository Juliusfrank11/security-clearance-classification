Applicant  is  36  years  old.  He  has  never  been  married  and  has  no  children.  He
earned a bachelor’s degree in 2007 and his master’s degree in 2011. In 2007, he started
employment  with  a  federal  contactor,  and  in  2012,  he  was  granted  a  DOD  security
clearance.  His  current  job  title  is  advanced  lead  engineer  and  his  annual  salary  is
approximately $110,000. (Tr. 8, 26; GE 1)
Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges Applicant failed to file his 2016, 2017, and 2018 Federal income
tax  returns.  He  also  failed  to  file  his  state  income  tax  returns  for  the  same  years.  He
admitted both SOR allegations (¶ 1.a and ¶ 1.b)
Applicant stated in his response to the SOR that the reason he fell behind on filing
his Federal and  state income  tax returns  was  due to  his taxes  becoming complicated.
This  stemmed,  in  part,  from  both  a  rental  property and  him  becoming  part  owner  of  a
family business. He expected tax refunds for all three years, and mistakenly believed that
he had three years to file the income tax returns in order to receive his Federal and state
tax refunds. In early 2020 he hired an accountant who was working on filing these specific
Federal and state income tax returns. (SOR Response; Tr. 41-42)
During  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  had  purchased  a  house  in  early
2008. Instead of selling the house when he moved out in 2013, he chose to turn it into a
rental property. There were years that he made about $12,000 - $14,000 in annual income
from  this  rental  property,  and  there  were  other  years  the  house  sat  vacant  while  he
remodeled the  bathroom and finished  other projects  on  the  home.  Overall,  he  has  not
made much money from the rental property, and as of the date of the hearing, he  was
planning  to  put  the  rental  property  up  for  sale  within  the  next  month  or  two.  When
preparing his Federal and state income tax returns for 2016, he  realized he had some
questions about properly reporting his rental income and expenses. He decided that he
needed the services of a tax professional. (Tr. 28-30)
The  other tax  complication   Applicant encountered  was related  to  being  gifted  in
2017  with  six  percent ownership  of a  family  business. His aunt  operated  two  ice cream
kiosks in a  large  out-of-state  mall. In  2017, he  received  quarterly   checks of  $6,000, or
$24,000  annual  revenue  for his six  percent  ownership. In  2018,  major renovations  were
made   on   the   kiosks,  which  impacted   his  earnings.  This  and   other   business  situations
affected  his Federal and  state  income  taxes.  He used  Turbo  Tax  software, but he  did not
feel comfortable  that he  had  prepared  his income  tax  returns  correctly. He realized  that
he again needed  professional tax  assistance  to  report his income  correctly  to  the  Federal
and state tax authorities. (Tr. 30-32, 37, 42)
In   early   2020,  Applicant  hired   an   accounting   service  to   prepare  his  delinquent
2016, 2017,  and  2018  state  and  Federal income  tax  returns, and  to  prepare his income
tax  returns  for  2019  as  well. According  to  the  Internal Revenue  Service (IRS)  transcripts
in the  record, in  June 2020,  Applicant’s 2019  and  2018  Federal income  tax  returns were
filed. Applicant’s 2016  Federal income  tax  return was filed  in  June  2021. Applicant stated
that he  made  a  tax  payment to  the  IRS  in June  2018  due  to  the  income  he  earned  from
the   family   business  in   2017.  There  was  confusion   about  the   tax   payment,   which  was
actually  recorded  as Applicant  filing  his 2017  Federal tax  return in June  2018, based  on
the   IRS   transcript   in   evidence.   The   accounting   service  saw   that   his  2017   Federal  tax
return was  listed as “filed”  in the IRS database. The  accounting service assumed  he had
filed   all   of  his income  tax   returns for  tax   year  2017,  so  they   did not  process  his   newly
prepared   state   income   tax   return  for  2017.   Applicant   was  not   aware  of  this   until  he
received notification  last year  from the state tax authority that his 2017 income tax return
had  never been  filed. (Tr. 44-52; AE C)
Applicant testified  that  he  initiated  contact with  a  professional tax  service before
he  received  the  SOR. He provided  documentation  which showed  the  accounting  service
had  prepared  the  2017  state  income  tax  return in May  2020.  In  June  2021,  he  received  a
2017  state  tax  refund  of $348.  The  accounting  service  also prepared  his 2016,  2018,  and
2019  state  income  tax  returns  in May  2020. Applicant  received  tax  refunds for all  of  these
tax  years. He also provided  documentation  from  the  accounting  service showing  that he
filed his 2020  Federal and state income tax returns in June  2021.  He intends to continue
using   the   tax   accounting   service  to   prepare  his  complicated   income   tax   returns  in  the
future.  He will receive  a  Federal tax  refund  of  $2,733  and  a  state  tax  refund  of  $941  for
tax  year 2020. All  unfiled  Federal and  state  income  tax  returns alleged  in the  SOR have
been   filed   and   fully   resolved.   Applicant   lives   within  his  means  and   does  not  have   any
other  financial delinquencies,  to  include  any  delinquent  state  or Federal  taxes.  (Tr.  36,
52, 76-80; AE B, AE C, AE E, AE F)
Personal Conduct
The  SOR  alleges  that  in  August  2013,  Applicant  received  a  complaint  from  a
former girlfriend that he was stalking her, harassing her, and ignoring her boundaries. The
court  issued  a  temporary  ex-parte  civil  order  of  protection.  At  a  later  hearing  where
Applicant personally appeared to address the complaint, the court extended the civil order
of protection until August 2018. (¶ 2.a; GE 2, GE 3; AE A)
Applicant  admitted   the   allegation   that  he   received   the   protective   order,  but  not
necessarily  the  alleged  inappropriate  or criminal conduct alleged  in  the  protective  order
in his response  to  the  SOR, and he  also provided  additional information  during  the  hearing
about  the   circumstances  of  this   toxic  relationship.   He   stated   that   his  former  girlfriend
threatened  to  kill herself repeatedly, harassed  him  with  constant  e-mails, phone  calls and
messages,   and   texts  from   unknown   phone   numbers.  He   denied   that  he   stalked   her,
harassed  her, or threatened  her with  violence. He showed  up  to  court to  respond  to  the
protection  order without any  evidence  of  her communications, since  she  had  deleted  most
of them  from  his phone,  and without the benefit of  a lawyer. Since  August 2013, the time
the  civil  protection  order was granted,  he  has had  no  contact with  his former girlfriend.
The  protective  order expired  in  August  2018.  He has  never had  any  other adverse issues
with law enforcement.  (SOR response, Tr. 52-74;  AE A)
