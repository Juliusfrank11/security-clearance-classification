The  Government  alleges  under  Guideline  H  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for  a
clearance  because  he  has  used  illegal  drugs.  He  admitted  through  counsel  “with
clarifications”  the  two  allegations  in  the  SOR  under  this  paragraph.  (SOR  Answer)
Those admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Background Information
Applicant is a  46-year-old senior principal engineer,  who  has been  employed  by
a  defense  contractor since  January  2005. (GE  1;  Tr.  12-13) He  seeks a  secret  security
clearance  to  enhance  his employability  and  upward mobility  within his company. (GE 1;
Tr. 13-14, 25-26, 28-30)
Applicant  never  received   his   high   school  diploma.  He  “had   some   hardship
growing  up  with  a  single mother.”  He quit  high  school, left  home,  and  got  a  full-time  job
at a  grocery  store when  he  was “about 17  years old,” after his mother attempted  suicide
in 1992.  (SOR  Answer; Tr. 14-15, 23-24)  Applicant “tested”  into  a  prestigious university,
and   was  awarded   a   bachelor  of   science   degree   in  mechanical  engineering   in  June
2003. He was awarded  a  master’s degree  in mechanical aerospace  engineering  in June
2005. He  completed  one  year of  coursework towards his Ph.D.  in  engineering; however,
he withdrew from the program “due  to  family considerations.” (Tr. 15-18, 24-29)
Applicant  married  in  June  1998  and  divorced  in April 2017.  He remarried  his wife
in  2018,  month   not   recalled.  He   has  two   minor  sons.  At  the   time   of   the   hearing,
Applicant’s  wife   was   unemployed,   having   previously  worked   as  an   administrative
assistant   for  a   university.   (GE  1;  Tr.  19-22,  46)  Applicant’s  annual  income   averages
about $150,000. However, 2020  was an  exception,  and  his  annual income  in 2020  was
$207,000. (Tr. 22)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant used marijuana on various occasions between
approximately 1993 and June 2017, and SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that he used marijuana on
various  occasions  between  approximately  January  2005  and  September  2008,  while
granted accessed to classified information. (SOR; SOR Answer)
This is not Applicant’s first DOHA hearing for drug-related security concerns. On
August 23, 2011,  DOHA issued  Applicant an SOR, followed by a hearing on February
15, 2012, discussed below. He explained that his failure to be “fully truthful about some
past drug use” led to the denial of his clearance after that 2012 hearing. However, since
that  experience,   he   has  been   “totally   truthful”  throughout  these   proceedings  since   his
reapplication  for a security clearance.  (Tr. 32-35)  Applicant’s marijuana use began when
he   was  17   or  18.  Before  his  mother’s  suicide   attempt,  he   was  a   good   student  and
athlete.  He  was  involved   in  the   community   with   tutoring   and   mentoring.   After  his
mother’s  suicide   attempt,  he   began   associating   with   individuals  who   used   marijuana.
(Tr. 35-36)
Applicant broke  down  his drug  use  into  two  timeframes,  from  1993  to  2005, and
from  2005 to  the  present.  Applicant stopped using  marijuana  in 2005  at age  30  when  he
started  his current job  and  was trying  to  be  responsible  in  the  workforce.  (Tr. 36-38) He
could  not  recall   during   direct  examination   the   precise   number   of   times  he   used
marijuana  during  college. His wife  does not drink, smoke, or use  any   illegal drugs. (Tr.
46-47) After beginning  his current job  in 2005, he   stated  that he  used  marijuana  three
times.   (SOR  Answer;  Tr.  38-39)   The   last   time   he   used   marijuana   was  in  2017   at  his
father-in-law’s  funeral.   His  family   was  in  a   circle  sharing   memories,  and   a   “joint   was
passed   around.”  Applicant  had   previously   held  a   clearance   from   January   2005   to
September 2008  and  had   used  marijuana   a   “few   times” during   that period.   (Tr. 39-40)
Applicant knew it was wrong to do that and self-reported his marijuana use. (Tr. 40)
Applicant has disassociated himself  “100  percent” from  the  individuals with  whom
he   smoked   marijuana.   He  submitted   a   signed   statement  of   intent   to   abstain  from   all
drug   involvement  and  substance   abuse,   acknowledging   that  any  future   involvement or
misuse   is  grounds  for   revocation   of   national  security   eligibility.  He   also  submitted   a
Certificate  of  Completion  for a  four-hour Drug  and  Alcohol Awareness Class  completed
on  September   18,   2017.  Applicant  stated   that  he   has no  desire  to  use  marijuana,   and
he   does  not   have   any   intent  to   use   marijuana   in   the   future.   He  took   a   privately
administered   drug   test  on   January   11,   2021,  the   day   before  his  hearing   that  was
negative. (Tr. 40-42, 57; SOR Answer (Exhibits 1 and  2); AE B)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  was  informed  of  his  company’s  zero  tolerance
drug-use  policy  when  he  was  hired  in  2005.  He  has  never  been  required  to  take  a
random drug test since he began his employment. (Tr. 47-49)
During   cross-examination,  Department  Counsel   elicited   further  details  from
Applicant regarding  his  past marijuana  use.  During  his first year of employment in  2005,
he   used   marijuana   “about  five   times  during   holidays  and   visits  with   friends.”  The   next
year  in  2006,   he   used   marijuana   “about  three   times  during   holidays  with   friends.”   In
addition,   in   2007,  he   used   marijuana   “a   couple  of  times  also   during   the   holidays.”  In
2008, he  used marijuana  “about one  time.” (GE  2; Tr. 49-50)  When  Applicant completed
an  SF-86  on February  8, 2005, he  denied  any  prior drug  use. He completed  an  SF-86
on  May  15, 2008,  and  again denied  any  prior drug  use.  However, during  an  August 3,
2009   Office   of  Personnel  Management   (OPM)  interview   preceding   a   polygraph,  he
disclosed  his prior marijuana use.  (GE  3, GE  6, GE 8; Tr. 50-51)
As  noted,  Applicant  appeared  at  a  DOHA  hearing  on  February  15,  2012.  His
SOR listed three allegations of drug use to which he admitted. The Administrative Judge
noted  in  his  findings  that  Applicant  had  used  illegal  drugs  from  about  1993  to
September 2008. His SOR also listed four allegations under personal conduct to which
he  admitted.  In particular,  he  denied  using marijuana  in  the  previous  seven  years and
using  any  controlled  substance  while  possessing  a  security  clearance.  Applicant  had
been  granted  a  security  clearance  in  November  2005,  and  eligibility  for  access  to
sensitive compartmented information (SCI) in July 2008. His clearance and SCI access
were  revoked  in  January  2010  because  of  drug  involvement  and  personal  conduct
issues. Applicant stated at his 2010 hearing that he did not currently use drugs and had
no desire to use drugs in the future. (GE 8, Tr. 52)
After his polygraph interview, Applicant stated that he did not use marijuana until
November 2016 when his father-in-law was placed in hospice care, then again in April
2017 at the birthday party for his wife and father-in-law, and again in June 2017 when
the  family  spread  his  father-in-law’s  ashes.  Applicant  knew  at  the  time  that  using
marijuana could affect his security clearance. He added that he was “a bit ignorant and
naïve  .  .  .  believing  that  the  laws  had  changed,”  but  knew  it  was  wrong  because  his
employer had a zero tolerance drug policy.  (Tr. 53-56) Applicant stated that he did not
use marijuana in 2018, 2019, 2020, or 2021. (Tr. 57) He also stated that he  has been
truthful about all of his past marijuana use. (Tr. 57-58)
Character Evidence
Applicant is active in his community. He has always sought to find a family within
the community. To that end, he coaches legal robotics and soccer, and has done so in
underrepresented communities. He was the team manager for his son’s soccer team for
the past four years. He also mentors junior engineers at his job site. Applicant earns a
good income and enjoys his work, but his career “hit a plateau” because of his inability
to work on classified projects. He considers himself a talented engineer who helped win
a  “multi-billion-dollar program,”  a program that he worked on for six years. (Tr.  22, 32,
42-44)
Applicant  submitted  several  pre- and post-employment certificates,  awards, and
academic  scholarships.  (SOR  Answer,  Exhibits,  3-6,  9)  His  2017  and  2018  annual
evaluations
reflect  sustained  superior  performance  and  document  Applicant’s
contributions  as  a  trusted  and  valued  employee.  His  2018  evaluation  notes  that
Applicant’s  technical  skills  are  “top  notch”  and  that  “he  is  always  willing  to  help.”  The
same evaluation gave him an overall rating of “Exceptional Contribution.” Applicant also
submitted  nine  work-related  certificates  from  2006  to  2009  that  acknowledge  his
contributions  on  various  company  projects.  He  has  received  three  patents  and  one
innovation  award.  (SOR  Answer,  Exhibit  7;  Tr.  29-31)  Applicant  considers  his
accomplishment of consistently receiving Technical Honors Awards every four years, a
total  of  three,  as  his  most  distinguished  professional  recognition.  His  personnel  file
indicates that he has received 29 awards for various accomplishments from November
2016 to January 2020. (SOR Answer; Exhibit 8)
