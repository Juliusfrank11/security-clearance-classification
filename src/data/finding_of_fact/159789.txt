Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 53 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1989 and a master’s
degree in 2001. He married in 2011 and has two children ages eight and four years old.
He has been employed by a federal contractor since September 2018. (Tr. 16-17; GE 1;
AE J, K)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  four  delinquent  credit  card  debts  totaling
approximately $49,447. He stopped paying the credit cards in 2014. Regarding the debt
in SOR ¶ 1.b, he said he contacted the creditor in 2015, but has not done anything since
then. He said he was expecting to receive an IRS Form 1099C, cancelation of debt, but
to date had not. (Tr. 37-40; GE 1, 2, 3)
Applicant testified he reached out to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.c in 2015, and then
again in 2018 or 2019, but claimed he could not find the current creditor. Regarding the
debt in SOR ¶ 1.d, he said that the debt was sold to a collection agency. He was offered
a settlement, but had not paid anything on the debt. He provided a copy of a settlement
offer from the  collection  company for this debt.  He has  not made payments to resolve
these two debts. (Tr. 40-43; AE P)
Applicant admitted he owed the debt in SOR ¶1.a ($21,059) and he defaulted on
it in 2014. He provided a copy of a news article and an administrative proceeding consent
order from 2015 against the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.a. The order was issued by the United
States Consumer Protection Bureau for harmful practices by the creditor in violation of
the Consumer Financial Protection Act. The order applied to the time period January 1,
2009, through June 30, 2014, for any pre-judgment collection litigation matters that were
pending  during  the  time  period;  collection  litigation  matters  where  a  judgment  was
obtained; and any court judgment that the creditor had obtained against the consumer
through collection litigation. Applicant testified that the creditor did not initiate a lawsuit
against  him.  He  said  he  validated  the  debt  in  2019  by  contacting  the  original  creditor
seeking a settlement agreement. He provided a document from December 2019 from the
creditor confirming a settlement agreement offer, where if Applicant agreed to settle the
debt the payments would be $527 a month from December 2019 to November 2020, with
the total amount to be paid of $6,324. No payments were made. Applicant testified that
he  was told he  would be  issued  an  IRS  Form  1099C, cancellation  of  debt  for this debt.
He said he  lost  communication  with  the  creditor. He believes his debt is included  in the
above  consent  order. Applicant may  have  a  legal defense  if  it  was deemed  that his debt
fell  within the  parameters of this  order.  His  credit reports from  April 2019  and  February
2020  reflect the  debt  was charged  off  by  the  credit  grantor  and  in  collection. (Tr. 32-37,
73; GE 2, 3; AE  F, N, O)
Applicant attributed  his financial problems to  extensive  damage  sustained  to  his
house  during  a  2005  hurricane, which required  major repairs. His homeowners insurance
only  paid  a  fraction  of the  amount and  then  it  went bankrupt.  He  estimated  the  costs  he
incurred,  not paid by  insurance,  was approximately  $20,000, or more. He said he  had  to
use  credit cards to  pay  for the  repairs. In  2008, his house  depreciated  due  to  the  housing
market,  and  his mortgage  payments  increased  because  he  had  an  interest-only  loan. His
homeowner  association   fees  also   increased.   In   2012,  he   sold  the   house   and   paid  the
mortgage, but lost  the  amount he  had put down as a deposit.  (Tr. 18-24;  AE A)
In   2012,  Applicant’s  wife   became   pregnant  with   their   first  child.   She   had
complications.  She  was working  at the  time  in  a  job  that required  her to  travel. She  had
to stop working due to  the stress. After the birth  of  the child, she  did  not go back to work.
Later   their   child   had   medical  issues   and   they   visited   multiple   doctors.  Their   child   was
diagnosed  with  autism  and  then  later with  another medical issue  that required  surgery.
He had  health  insurance, but there  were  extra  medical  expenses  that he  paid  that were
not  covered.   He  testified   that  his  son’s  surgery   was  in  2015.  His  son’s  other  medical
issues were resolved  around  2016  or 2017. The  child  attends a  private  school that  meets
his special needs. (Tr. 24-28, 60-62, 71-72; AE B, C, D,  E)
Applicant’s wife  has been  working  part-time  for about eight or nine  months, earning
about $1,500  a  month. Applicant earns about  $132,000  annually. He participated  in credit
counseling  in January  2020  that was approximately  an  hour long. A  debt  repayment plan
was  not   prepared.   He   does   not  have   a   written   budget.   He   said   he   contacted   a   debt
consolidation   company   in  2018,   but  the   fees  associated   with   its   proposed   plan   were
prohibitive,  and  he  decided  to  address the  problem  on  his own. He  said his  finances  are
stable,  and  he  is financially  responsible. He  testified  that more recently  he  has been  trying
to  address his delinquent debts,  but wants to  be  confident he  is paying  the  correct creditor.
He said he will  wait for  an  IRS  Form  1099C  to be sent to him  and then settle the  matters
with  the  IRS. He  did not offer any  substantive  evidence  of  efforts he  made  to  pay  these
creditors. He noted  that if  he  initiated  contact with  a  creditor, because  of  the  age  of  the
debt, it could restart the  clock for the  statute  of  limitations. (Tr. 24-25, 28, 45-60, 63-67;
AE  G, H)
Applicant purchased  a  new  home  in  February  2021  for  $379,000. He put a  down
payment  of  $15,000. He  testified  the  down  payment was from  money  he  saved. He and
his family traveled  to Europe to visit family in  2009,  2010,  2012,  2013,  and  2018. (Tr. 67-
71, 74-76; GE 1)
Applicant  provided   a   copy   of   his  resume,  an   award  citation,  and   his  2019
performance  review  noting  that he  “exceeded  expectations.” He also  provided  character
letters describing  him  as reliable, conscientious, stable,  calm,  hard-working, trustworthy,
dedicated,  admired,  exceptional, dependable,  loyal, patriotic, and  a  skilled  employee.  He
is well-liked by his teammates and is considered a  man of integrity. (AE I, J, K, M)
