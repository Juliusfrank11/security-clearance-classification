Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b. and 1.e. He denied SOR
allegations  ¶¶  1.c.  and  1.d.,  and  1.f.~1.i.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  60-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with a defense contractor for “30 years,” with a break in 2014 when Applicant
was “laid off” and was advised by counsel to then retire. (TR at 20 line 21 to page 22 at
line  18.)  In  2002,  he  had  been  injured  on  the  job; and  as  such,  “worked  with  a  limited
workload.”  (TR  at  page  24  line  14  to  page  25  line  14.)  In  March  of  2015,  Applicant’s
disability  payments  were  cut  off;  and  Applicant  became  homeless  for  “two  and  a  half
years,”  until  he  was  reemployed  in  2018.  (TR  at  page  26  line  15  to  page  27  line  25.)
He  is  married,  and  his wife  is  in  critical  condition  “with  a  large  mass  that  needs  to  be
removed,” but Applicant is able to pay her medical bills. (TR at page 40 lines 6~25.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a.  and  1.b   While homeless, from 2015~2018, Applicant’s financial documents
were misplaced in “a storage unit;” and as such, he was unable to file both Federal and
state tax returns for tax years 2015~2017 in a timely fashion. (TR at page 30 line 25 to
page  34  line  22.)  They  have  since  been  filed,  prior  to  the  issuance  of  the  SOR,  as
evidenced by Federal and state tax documentation. (AppXs A and B.)
1.c.  Applicant has paid his Federal income taxes owed for tax year 2017 by way
of  installments,  as  evidenced  by  documentation  from  the  Internal  Revenue  Service
(IRS). (TR at page 35 lines 1~2, and AppX C.)
1.d. Applicant’s past-due debt to Creditor D has been paid by wage garnishment,
as  evidenced  by  documentation  from  Creditor  D’s  counsel.  (TR  at  page  35  line  4  to
page 36 line 18, and AppX D.)
1.e.  Applicant’s  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  E  has  been  settled  and  paid,  as
evidenced  by  banking  documentation.  (TR  at  page  36  line  19  to  page  37  line  3,  and
AppX E.)
1.f.  Applicant’s  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  F  has  been  paid,  as  evidenced  by
documentation from Creditor F. (TR at page 37 lines 4~10, and AppX F.)
1.g.  Applicant’s  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  G  has  been  paid,  as  evidenced  by
documentation from the successor creditor to Creditor G. (TR at page 37 line 11 to page
38 line 4, and AppX G.)
1.h.  Applicant’s  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  H  has  been  paid,  as  evidenced  by
documentation  from  the  successor  creditor  to  Creditor  H.  (TR  at  page  38  lines  5~21,
and AppX H.)
1.i.  Applicant’s  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  I  has  been  settled  and  paid,  as
evidenced by documentation from Creditor I. (TR at page 38 line 22 to page 39 line 1,
and AppX I.)
