Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  in  the  SOR,  except  for  ¶¶  1.u.,  and  1.x.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  44-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with the defense contractor since March of  2019. (TR at page 5 lines 7~22,
and GX 1 at page 17.) He is twice divorced, in 2007 and in 2013, and has two children,
one of which he is still providing child support. (TR at page 49 line 18 to page 50 line 12,
and  GX  1  at  pages  30~31.)  Applicant  attributes  his  financial  difficulties  to  his  two
divorces, and their related child support obligations; to his father’s death in 2008 and to
the tragic death of two nieces in 2013; and to periods of unemployment in 2007 and in
2013.  (TR  at  page  15  line  3  to  page  39  line  25.)  He  has  a  Master  of  Business
Administration degree. (AppX K at page 2.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a.~  1.n. Applicant admits that he failed to file  in a  timely fashion  both Federal
and  state  income  tax  returns  in  a  timely  fashion  for  tax  years  2011~2013,  and
2015~2018. (TR at page 29 line 11 to page 30 line 3, and at page 44 line 25 to page 46
line  14.)  He  owes  about  $83,000  in  Federal  back-taxes,  and  about  $20,000  in  state
back-taxes, for which he has set up payment plans. (TR at page 47 line 19 to page 48
line 2, and AppXs X through AA, and FF and II.)
1.o., 1.p., 1.r. and  1.t. As of May 2021, Applicant has student loans totaling about
$216,000, of  which about $11,000 is past due. (TR at page 50 line 13 to page 52 line
23, at page 61 line 6 to page 62 line 13, and AppX BB.) In November of 2021, Applicant
will begin making monthly payments of $598 towards his student loans. AppX  CC.)
1.q. Applicant admits that he owed Creditor Q about $24,000 as the result of an
auto loan that has been charged-off. (TR at page 62 line 15 to page 63 line 12.) Despite
having  two  months  post-hearing  to  address  this  debt,  Applicant  has  offered  nothing
further in this regard.
1.s.   and   1.v.  Applicant  admits  that  he  owes  Creditor  S  about  $19,000  as  the
successor of “private” loans that have been charged-off. (TR at page 63 line 20 to page
64 line 11.) Despite having two months post-hearing to address this debt, Applicant has
offered nothing further in this regard.
1.u. Applicant denies a debt to Creditor U in the amount of about $4,400. (TR at
page 64 line 12 to page 65 line 13.) Creditor U, by letter, has informed Applicant  that it
“has  ceased   collection   of  this  account.”  (AppX   DD.)  This  allegation   is  found   for
Applicant.
1.w.  Applicant  admits
the
result of  a 2011  debt for an  “engagement ring.” (TR at page  52  line 24 to page 53 line
21, and at page 59 lines 8~25.) Despite having two months post-hearing to address this
debt, Applicant has offered nothing further in this regard.
that  he  owes  Creditor  W  about  $1,300  as
1.x.  Applicant  denies  a  debt  to  Creditor  X  in  the  amount  of  about  $75.  (TR  at
page 65 line 17 to page 66 line 25.) It appears that  a successor creditor to Creditor X,
which  by letter, has  informed Applicant that  this debt will be  removed  from  Applicant’s
credit reports (AppX DD.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
