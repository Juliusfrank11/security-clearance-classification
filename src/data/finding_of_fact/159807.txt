Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the  pleadings,  including  Applicant’s  admissions  in  his  Answer,  his  testimony,  and  the
documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 56 years old. He was born in Mexico and entered the United States
with his family in 1971 at age 6.He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1999. He married
in 1982 at age 17 and did not graduate from high school. He was widowed in 2009. He
and his deceased wife have three adult children. He remarried in 2016. His second wife
has three adult children, one of  whom  lives with  Applicant  and  her  mother.  Applicant’s
wife  works  at  a  church.  Since  2001  he  has  worked  for  four  different  employers  as  a
machinist. In 2019 he began working for his current employer, a major DoD contractor.
His current position requires that he have eligibility for a security clearance. (Tr. at 17-21,
40-43.)
Applicant worked for Company A from 2001 until 2015, when the employer went
bankrupt.  He then  worked for Company B for three months until he  was  unexpectedly
terminated.  The  reason  for  his  termination  was  that  he  did  not  meet  the  employer’s
standards. He worked for Company C from 2016 to August 2018. He began working for
Company  D,  the  DoD  contractor,  immediately  after  terminating  his  employment  with
Company C. (Tr. at 17-21; GE 2 at 2.)
Since the death of his first wife, Applicant began to experience financial problems
due to excessive  credit-card  debt. For a  long period,  he had negative  cash flow every
month, and he made up the difference with credit cards. His expenses were for his rent,
food, car payments, insurance, and other general living expenses of  his children while
they were growing up. One of his sons went to college, and Applicant paid a lot of the
son’s expenses with credit cards rather than student loans. He also incurred debts during
the period of his first wife’s ultimately fatal illness  and for her funeral, which cost about
$10,000. His children continued to live with him until 2016, when he remarried and moved
out of the family home. The children also moved out at that time. He got behind on his
bills with excessive debts, and he could not recover for several years. His annual income
in the 2015-2016 time period when he worked for Company A and Company B was about
$60,000.  His  income  continued  at  that  level  until  2018  when  he  began  working  for
Company  D,  his  current  employer.  In  2018,  his  annual  income  increased  to  about
$80,000. It was at that time that he was able to begin repaying his debts using the services
of a debt-relief company (D/R Company). (Tr.at 25-31, 41-42.)
Applicant  reported  on  his  SCA  that  he  was  delinquent  on  15  credit  accounts,
consisting primarily of bank credit cards and retail store credit cards. He advised that he
had an estimated total delinquent debt of about $62,500. He reported in his SCA that the
financial delinquencies all began in about October 2015. In September 2018, about one
year before he submitted his SCA, Applicant hired the D/R Company. To qualify for debt
relief,  his  counselor  advised  Applicant  to  stop  paying  his  debts  for  three  months.  He
followed his counselor’s advice, and instead, he began making payments to the bank of
the D/R Company. Since 2018, he has been paying the D/R Company $798 every month
($399 every two weeks) by automatic bank transfer. The D/R Company initially advised
Applicant that it will pay off his debts in about four years, i.e., by late 2022. Applicant has
recently  been  advised  that  it may  take  an  extra  year  or  two  to  resolve  all  of  his debts
unless he makes a larger monthly payment. He cannot afford to pay more  at this time
because he is ineligible to work overtime without a security clearance. (Tr. at 32-36.)
SOR  Debts
The SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to 12 creditors in the approximate total
amount of $54,500. In his Answer, Applicant admitted each of the following debts alleged
in the SOR:
1.a   Credit  account   in  the   amount   of   $12,236.   The  D/R  Company  negotiated  a
settlement  of  this  debt  in  the  amount  of  $8,050  and  is  paying  this  debt  pursuant  to  a
payment plan. This debt is being resolved. (Tr. at 25-27, 33, 37-38; GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at
1; GE 5 at 3-4; Answer at 4; AE B.)
1.b  Credit  account  in the  amount  of  $10,992.  GE 5 reflects that this debt has been paid
for less than the full balance. An exhibit attached to the Answer and AE B also reflect that
this debt has been paid. This debt has been resolved. (GE 3 at 8; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 4;
Answer at 4; AE B.)
1.c   Credit   account   in  the   amount   of   $4,843.  This  debt  is  “enrolled”  with  the  D/R
Company to be resolved after other debts have been paid. This debt will be resolved.
(GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 4; Answer at 4; AE B.)
1.d  Credit   account   in  the   amount   of   $4,307.   The  D/R  Company  has  negotiated  a
settlement  of  this  debt  in  the  amount  of  $2,283  and  is  paying  this  debt  pursuant  to  a
payment plan. This debt is being resolved. (GE 3 at 7; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2-3; Answer
at 4; AE B.)
1.e  Credit a  ccount  in the  amount of $3,573.  GE 5 reflects that this debt has been paid
off for less than the full balance. An exhibit attached to the Answer and AE B also reflect
that this debt has been paid. This debt has been resolved. (Tr. at 38; GE 3 at 6; GE 4
at 2; GE 5 at 3; Answer at 4; AE B.)
1.f Credit account  in the  amount  of  $3,200. The D/R Company negotiated a settlement
of this debt in the amount of $1,697 and is paying this debt pursuant to a payment plan.
This debt is being resolved. (GE 3 at 7; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; Answer at 4; AE B.)
1.g Credit account in  the amount of $3,134. GE 5 reflects that this debt has been paid
off for less than the full balance. An exhibit attached to the Answer and AE B also reflect
that this debt has been paid. This debt has been resolved. (GE 3 at 8; GE 4 at 2; GE 5
at 3; Answer at 4; AE B.)
1.h  Credit account  in the  amount  of  $2,255. This debt is enrolled with the D/R Company
to be resolved after other debts have been paid off. This debt will be resolved. (GE 3 at
7; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; Answer at 4; AE B.)
1.i.  Credit account  in the  amount  of  $2,090.  The D/R Company negotiated a settlement
of this debt in the amount of $1,061. AE A evidences payments made in February and
March 2021. AE B reflects that this debt has been paid. This debt has been resolved.
(GE 3 at 8; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; Answer at 4; AE A; AE B.)
1.j  Credit account  in the  amount  of  $1,299. This debt is enrolled with the D/R Company
to be resolved after other debts have been paid off. This debt will be resolved. (GE 3 at
9; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; Answer at 4; AE B.)
1.k  Credit account  in the  amount  of  $656.  GE 5 reflects that this debt has been paid
for less than the full balance. This small debt is not identified on the D/R Company’s list
of Applicant’s debts, i.e., AE B. Applicant settled this debt directly with the creditor. This
debt has been resolved. (GE 3 at 5; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 3; Answer at 4; AE B.)
1.l   Delinquent   credit   account.  The  SOR  does  not  allege  a  specific  amount  of  this
indebtedness. GE 5, which is dated after the SOR was issued, reflects that the amount
ultimately charged off was $6,011.  AE B evidences that this debt has been paid.  This
debt has been resolved. (Tr. at 24; GE 3 at 7; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 5; Answer at 4; AE B.)
In summary, Applicant Exhibit B evidences that since 2018 Applicant and the D/R
Company  have  paid  six  of  the  12  SOR  debts  and  that  the  D/R  Company  is  currently
paying another three SOR debts. The total amounts of the six paid debts as alleged in
the SOR is approximately $26,500, about one-half of all of the SOR debts  of $54,500.
The amounts alleged in the SOR for the three debts currently being paid is about $20,000.
There  are  three  more  SOR  debts  to  be  paid  by  the  D/R  Company.  The  total  of  the
amounts alleged in the SOR for these three debts is about $8,500. In addition, the D/R
Company settled one debt with a bank with a charge off of $7,509 that was not alleged in
the  SOR,  increasing  the  total  completed  settlements  to  about  $34,000. That  debt  was
paid off by the D/R Company prior to the date of the Government’s earliest credit report,
GE 3, which reflects that this debt was already paid by the date of the report, August 28,
2019. There are two other debts that were not alleged in the SOR and do not appear in
the Government’s credit reports. These debts have been enrolled with the D/R Company
to be negotiated and paid. They total another $6,000. (GE 3 at 6; Answer at 4; AE B.)
