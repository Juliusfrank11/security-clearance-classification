Applicant is a  47-year-old employee who  is seeking a security clearance for his
job  with  a  federal  contractor.  He  works  as  an  account  manager  for  a  company  doing
business  in  the  defense  industry.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance  in  the  past  while
working in the defense industry and during military service. (Exhibit 10 at 12-13) He has
been married and divorced twice. He has two adult children from his first marriage. His
formal education includes a bachelor’s degree awarded in 2004.
Applicant’s employment history includes honorable military service on active duty
with the U.S. Air Force during 1995-1999. He has been continuously employed since at
least 2005. He worked as a systems engineer during 2005-2012. He next worked as an
account manager during 2012-2019. He began his current job as an account manager
in January 2019.
The   SOR  alleges  a   history   of  financial  problems   or  difficulties   consisting   of  a
Chapter  13   bankruptcy   case,  filed   in  2007   and   discharged   in  2012,  as   well   as  seven
collection  or  charged-off  accounts  in amounts  ranging  from  $3,061  to  $11,308  for a  total
of   approximately   $41,000.   He  disclosed   his history   of  financial  problems   and   provided
an  explanation   thereof  in   his 2019   security   clearance   application.   (Exhibit  4   at   Section
26)  He   admitted   the   SOR  allegations  in   his  answer  to   the   SOR.  In   addition   to   his
admissions, the  Chapter 13  bankruptcy  case  is established  by  bankruptcy  court records
(Exhibit  5),  and   the   seven   delinquent  accounts  in   the   SOR   are  established   by   credit
reports from  2019-2021. (Exhibits 6, 7, 8, and 9)
Applicant  attributed  the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  case  to  the  fallout  from  his  first
divorce in 2006. Married in 1993, Applicant and his spouse had two children, a son and
a daughter. The divorce was final in October 2006, although the petition for divorce was
filed in December 2005. Applicant explained that his spouse ran up several credit card
accounts  before  she  filed  for  divorce.  The  divorce  was  protracted.  As  a  result  of  the
divorce, Applicant was required to repay marital debt as well as pay both child support
and  alimony.  Given  his  income  at  the  time,  he  was  unable  to  meet  his  financial
responsibilities, and so he sought relief in bankruptcy court.
A  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  case  is  also  called  a  wage  earner's  plan,  because  it
enables  individuals  with  regular  income  to  develop  a  plan  to  repay  all  or  part  of  their
debts in monthly installments to creditors over three to five years. The bankruptcy case
records in Applicant’s case show he filed a Chapter 13 petition in April 2007 (less than a
year  after  the  divorce);  the  bankruptcy  court  approved  the  repayment  plan  in  March
2008; Applicant completed the repayment plan in April 2012; and the bankruptcy court
granted Applicant a discharge in May 2012. (Exhibit 5)
Applicant  attributed  the  seven  delinquent  debts  to  substantial  costs  he  incurred
during a legal dispute with his first spouse during 2017-2019. Applicant sought to modify
the  child-support  order  since  his  oldest  son  was  no  longer  a  minor,  and  he  sought
custody  of  his  minor  daughter  as  she  wanted  to  live  with  him.  His  spouse  contested
both  requests.  The  case  took  nearly  two  years  until  it  was  concluded  in  March  2019,
when his daughter was two months shy of age 18. The following month in April 2019 he
retained the services of a firm to assist him in dealing with his delinquent debts.
Applicant  described   the   firm   as   a   debt-settlement  company,  but   that  is  not   the
firm’s   business  model.   The   supporting   documentation   with   Applicant’s  answer  to   the
SOR  includes   the  paperwork from   this firm, which  describes   the  business   as   assisting
customers in  the preparation of documents  that may  assist in  removing  inaccurate  items
from   credit   reports.  The   agreement   signed   by   Applicant   indicates  the   company   will
provide   services  (1)   to   assist  in  determining   if   third-party   debt  collectors  are  lawfully
attempting   to   collect   debts   and   (2)  to   assist  in  the   removal  of  inaccurate   items   from
credit  reports.  The   consumer-services  section   of  the   agreement  does  not   mention   the
terms debt settlement  or debt consolidation.
By  entering  into the  agreement,  Applicant agreed  to  pay  an  initial fee  of $766 and
then   pay   a   fee   of   $765.99   for  17   monthly   payments,   in  exchange   for  the   services
provided.  Furthermore,  in  the   client-acknowledgments  section   of  the   agreement,   it  is
made   clear  that  the   company   is  not  in  the   debt-settlement  or  debt-consolidation
business.  Applicant  acknowledged,  among   other  things,  the   following:  (1)  he   could
perform   any   of   the   services  explained   in  the   agreement   without  entering   into   the
agreement;   (2)  the   company   does  not  settle   or  reduce   his  debt  but  rather  assists  in
determining   if   creditors  are  reporting   accurate   information   to   credit   reporting   agencies;
(3)  the   company   is  not  a   debt-consolidation   or  debt-settlement  company;  and   (4)  the
company   does   not  pay   off   his  alleged   creditors  with   the   funds  he   pays,  rather  those
funds  go   directly   to   pay   the   company   for  their   services  it  provides  to   him.  I  find   that
Applicant did not enter  into  a  debt-settlement plan  with  the  company  but rather hired  the
company   to   provide   services  in  the   nature   of   credit  repair.   Without  an   opportunity   to
question Applicant,  I cannot determine  if he  fully understood the  agreement.
In  his  reply  to  the  FORM,  Applicant  provided  reliable  documentary  evidence
showing that he settled the seven collection and charged-off accounts in the SOR. First,
he  settled  a  $3,061  medical  collection  account  with  a  third-party  collector  (who
requested the account be deleted) in May 2021. (Exhibit B) Second, he settled a $5,363
charged-off account for the lesser amount of $1,984 in May 2021. (Exhibit C and Exhibit
I at 3) Third, he settled an $8,271 charged-off account for the lesser amount of $3,300
in May 2021. (Exhibit D) Fourth, he settled a $3,563 charged-off account for the lesser
amount  of  $1,318  in  June  2021.  (Exhibit  E)  Fifth,  he  settled  a  $5,847  charged-off
account  for  the  lesser  amount  of  $2,338  in  May  2021.  (Exhibit  F)  Sixth,  he  settled  an
$11,308  charged-off  account  (that  was  pending  a  lawsuit)  for  the  lesser  amount  of
$6,900 in January 2021. (Exhibit G) And seventh, he settled a $4,413 collection account
for the lesser amount of $1,544 in May 2021. (Exhibit H)
Applicant  was  able  to  settle  the  seven  delinquent  accounts  (contrary  to  the
advice he was receiving from the credit-repair firm) due to a substantial increase in his
wages  from  his  current  employment  as  compared  with  his  previous  employment.  His
wages in 2020 were more than $400,000, and he had more than $100,000 in a savings
account as of February 2021. (Answer at 4, 6)
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3  The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4

‘right’  to a security  clearance”); Duane v. Department  of Defense, 275 F.3d  988,  994 (10th  Cir. 2002)  (no
right to a security clearance).

There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.6
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying
conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  or difficulties  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.
The disqualifying conditions noted above apply.
Applicant  has  sufficiently  explained  and  mitigated  his  history  of  financial
problems.  His  financial  problems  were  related  to  circumstances  largely  beyond  his
control;  namely,  his  first  divorce  in  2006  and  the  child-custody  and  child-support
disputes in 2017-2019. He acted responsibly under the circumstances by taking action
to  recover  from  each.  As  a  result  of  the  financial  stress  created  by  the  divorce,  he

6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶¶ E3.1.14 and E3.1.15
sought  relief  via  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  case.  He  entered  into  a  court-approved
repayment plan, which he completed in 2012. As a result of the financial stress created
by  the  legal  disputes  in  2017-2019,  he  sought  professional  assistance  from  what  he
apparently  believed  was  a  debt-settlement  firm.  He  wisely  abandoned  that  firm’s
recommended  course  of  action  when  he  received  the  FORM  and  took  action  to  settle
the delinquent accounts. His settlement of the seven delinquent accounts qualifies as a
good-faith  effort  to  repay  his  creditors.  Unlike  many  financial  cases  I  see,  he  did  an
excellent job documenting his remedial actions. Moreover, given his recent, substantial
increase  in  income  and  that  both  his  children  are  no  longer  minors,  it  is  unlikely  that
similar  financial  problems  will  recur.  Accordingly,  the  mitigating  conditions  at  AG  ¶¶
20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) apply in Applicant’s favor.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent  standard,  I  have  no  doubts  and
concerns  about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to
protect  classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the
evidence  as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the
unfavorable  evidence  or  vice  versa.  I  also  considered  the  whole-person  concept.  I
conclude  that  he  has  met  his  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  show  that  it  is  clearly
consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  him  eligibility  for  access  to  classified
information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph  1, Guideline  F:
For Applicant
Subparagraphs  1.a  -- h:
For Applicant
Conclusion
It  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for
access to classified information. National security eligibility granted.
