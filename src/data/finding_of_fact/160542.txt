In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. The admitted
financial  allegations  include  a  delinquent  consumer  account  in  collection  for  $446  (¶
1.a); 12 delinquent medical accounts in collection totaling about $3,732 (¶¶ 1.b through
1.m); and five student loans in collection totaling about $15,499 (¶¶ 1.n through 1.r), all
of  which  are  also  established  by  the  credit  reports  (FORM  Items  6–8).  Applicant  also
admitted to falsifying her 2019 SCA in failing to disclose any of her delinquencies.  Her
admissions  are  incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  review  of  the
record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 28-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has never been
married and has no children. She graduated from high school in 2011, and attended two
different colleges between September 2011 and March 2015; however, she did not earn
a degree.
Applicant  started  working  for  her  current  employer  and  clearance  sponsor  in
October  2019.  This  is  her  first  clearance  application.  According  to  her  2019  SCA,
Applicant  was  unemployed  between  July  and  October  2019;  and  employed  between
June 2018 and July 2019. In  her November 2019 SCA, Applicant claimed her position
was terminated in July 2019. However, during her December 2019 interview, Applicant
admitted  that  she  was  terminated  because  she  was  taking  excessive  time  off.  (Form,
Item 5)
Applicant  was  employed  between  March  and  June  2018;  unemployed  between
February and March 2018; and employed between November 2015 and February 2018.
She was employed part time between June 2015 and January 2016; and fully employed
between  November  13,  2013  and  June  2015.  She  was  unemployed  while  in  college
between September 2011 and November 2013.
Section 26 (Financial Record) of Applicant’s 2019 SCA asked whether in the past
seven  years  she  had:  (1)  bills  or  debts  turned  over  to  a  collection  agency;  (2)  any
account or credit card suspended, charged off, of cancelled for failing to pay as agreed;
(3) defaulted on any type of loan; and (4) been over 120 days delinquent on any debt; or
was currently over 120 days delinquent on any debt. Applicant answered “NO” to all the
above questions and deliberately failed to disclose the delinquent accounts and student
loans in collection alleged in the SOR.
During her December 2019 interview, Applicant claimed that her failure to list her
student  loans  was  an  oversight.  She  stated  she  fell  behind  on  her  student  loans  in
2013-2014,  and  claimed  her  mother  told  her  that  either  she  (her  mother)  or  the  state
would take care of the loans. Applicant averred she discovered her student loans were
delinquent and in collection when her income tax refunds were  confiscated by the IRS
to apply the refunds to her student loan debt starting in 2017.
Concerning  the  12  delinquent  medical  and  consumer  debt  accounts,  Applicant
told the investigator that her failure to disclose them in the 2019 SCA was an oversight.
She stated that she went through a financial hardship and her debts became delinquent.
Applicant claimed that between 2014 and 2016, she made sporadic payments of $200
per month to resolve her medical bills, and she mistakenly believed the medical debts
had  been  satisfied.  Applicant  presented  no  documentary  evidence  of  payments  made
on any of the accounts alleged in the SOR since the day she acquired the obligations to
the day she answered the FORM.
Applicant stated in her interview and in her answer to the FORM that her financial
hardship was caused by periods of unemployment. She stated that she was immature
regarding  her  finances  in  2011-2012,  but  believed  she  had  become  more  mature
financially  after  2015.  Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  she  intended  to  establish
payment  plans  to  pay  off  her  debts  sometime  in  the  future  - when  she  has  funds
available to do so. Applicant believes that she lives within her financial means; that she
can pay her debts through payment plans; and that her financial situation is stable.
In her answer to the FORM, Applicant stated that she did not intend to falsify her
2019  SCA.  She  noted  that  she  had  been  struggling  financially  and  mentally.  (She  did
not  explain  what  her  mental  struggles  are.)  Applicant  averred  she  did  not  know  her
medical  bills  were  accumulating  because  she  believed  her  father  was  paying  them  or
her insurance was doing so. Applicant promised to take control of her financial situation
and fix her financial problems. She claimed she was paying $200 a month to a creditor,
but  failed  to  submit  any  documentary  evidence  of  any  contact  with  creditors,  of  any
payment plans established, or of any payments made on any of the debts alleged in the
SOR.
Applicant  did  not  present  evidence  of  her  current  financial  situation  (gross
monthly  income,  deductions,  monthly  expenses,  and  monthly  net  remainder).  She  did
not present evidence  to show that  she has a working budget. There is no evidence to
show Applicant has had recent financial counseling.
