The SOR alleges an unpaid $4,088 judgment to a collection unit for a state (SOR

second  mortgage  loan  that  was  $4,618  past  due,  with  a  balance  of  $36,584  (SOR  ¶
1.h); and seven miscellaneous delinquent debts totaling about $21,700 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.f
and 1.i-1.k).
Applicant  denied  owing  the  $12,485  charged-off  auto  loan  (SOR  ¶  1.b).  He
admitted that he owed the remaining debts, except he indicated that the judgment had
been  resolved  in  December  2019.  The  alleged  debts  are  listed  on  a  November  2019
credit report, an August 2020 credit report, or both credit reports. (Items 2, 5, 6)
Court  records  indicate  that  the  $4,088  judgment  to  a  collection  unit  for  a  state
(SOR ¶ 1.a) was entered against Applicant in August 2016. The judgment was satisfied
in November 2020. (Item 2, 4)
The   $12,485   charged-off   auto   loan   (SOR  ¶   1.b)  is  a   joint  account.   Applicant
asserted   that   he  cosigned   the  loan   for an  individual; the  vehicle   was “totaled”;   and   the
individual agreed  that she  would handle the  remaining  balance.  There is no  evidence  of
payments on this account.  (Items 2, 5, 6)
The  November  2019  credit  report  listed  that  Applicant’s  primary  mortgage  loan
was $6,226 past due, with a balance of $148,774. The terms of  the primary mortgage
loan are $1,245 per month for 360 months. It reported that he was $5,213 past due on
his  second  mortgage  loan,  with  a  balance  of  $36,865.  The  terms  of  the  second
mortgage loan are $330 per month for 360 months. The August 2020 credit report listed
his  primary  mortgage  loan  as  current,  with  a  balance  of  $140,276.  The  second
mortgage loan was $4,618 past due, with a balance of $36,584 (SOR ¶ 1.h). Applicant
stated  that  he  paid  the  late  payments  on  his  mortgage  loan  to  avoid  foreclosure.  He
stated that he is paying an extra $30 plus per month to finish the mortgage early. (Items
2, 5, 6)
There  is  no  evidence  of  payments  toward  the  remaining  SOR  debts.  Applicant
attributed  his  financial  problems  to  unemployment  in  2013  and  subsequent  periods  of
underemployment  and  low-paying  jobs.  He  reported  consistent  employment  since
January 2014 on his August 2019 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86).
He stated that he is working to obtain information technology (IT) certifications that will
enable him to earn a higher salary and pay his debts. There is no evidence of financial
counseling. (Items 2, 3, 5, 6)
