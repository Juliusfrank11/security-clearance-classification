After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant’s Answer to the SOR (Item 1),
and his FORM response (AE A), I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 60-year-old computer-based training specialist. As of March 2021, he
was with a company contracted to provide support regarding a DOD health information
program. (Item 2; AE A.) He and his spouse have been married since October 1982, and
they have a 33-year-old son and a 36-year-old daughter. (Item 3.)
Applicant was a member of the Army National Guard from approximately November
1979  to  May  1983.  He  then  entered  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  and  served
honorably until he retired in February 2003. He earned an associate’s degree in 1989, and
a bachelor’s degree in February 2004. He has taken a couple of classes toward a master’s
degree. (Items 2-3.)
Applicant was employed as a business analyst in the commercial sector from June
2008 to June 2009, when he was laid off. From June 2009 to November 2010, he worked
as a GS-11 step 3 trainer of a computer-based information system at an Army hospital. He
built accounts allowing for the access of government medical records. (Item 2; AE A.) He
resigned in November 2010 to work on a contract basis as a clinical application analyst for
a medical company. He was guaranteed 40-hour work weeks at $80 per hour plus $100
per diem in travel reimbursements. When the contract ended a year later, he gained full-
time  employment  in  November 2011  at  an  annual salary of  $87,000  as a trainer for a
healthcare  system,  which  meant  a  relocation  for  him  and  his  family.  Applicant  initially
rented in his new location. A year later, he and his spouse paid off their old mortgage,
which they had acquired in August 2006 for $130,000. (Item 4.) In November 2013, they
bought a home. (Item 2; AE A.) Applicant’s November 2018 credit report shows that, in
November 2013, they obtained a joint 30-year conventional mortgage of $356,000, to be
repaid at approximately $2,333 a month. They fell behind 30 days on their loan in April
2016 but were otherwise current in their monthly payments. (Items 4-5.)
In  November  2016,  Applicant  lost  his  job  of  five  years  in  a  layoff.  During  his
unemployment  from  November  2016  to  August  2017  (Items  2-3),  he  received
unemployment compensation. (Item 3.) He also had his military retirement income. (AE A.)
He and his spouse remained current on their mortgage loan. (Item 4.) Applicant indicated
in response to the FORM that, at the time, he feared that he could no longer afford the
monthly payments of “around $730 a month” for a new 2017 model-year truck, so he sold
the truck. With the equity from the sale, Applicant purchased a used 2005 model-year truck
with much lower payments. (AE A.) Available credit reports (Items 4-6) do not reflect a
sizeable automobile loan obtained in 2016 or 2017 for a new truck. They show a vehicle
loan obtained for $12,400 in November 2016, which could be for the 2005 model-year
truck. He had just paid off a $35,092 vehicle loan obtained in April 2014 for $35,092, but
that could not have been for a 2017 model-year vehicle. (Item 4.)
In August 2017, Applicant began working as a trainer for another medical company.
In December 2017, Applicant was “let go” when his then employer mistook his application
for  another  position  within  the  company  as  a  resignation.  (Item  2.)  Applicant  was
unemployed until November 2018, when he began working out of his home as a full-time
computer-based training content developer for a defense contractor. (Item 3.)
On  November  8,  2018,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to inquiries concerning
delinquency involving routine accounts in the last seven years, he listed a charged-off debt
for $500 with a sporting goods retailer. He disclosed no other past-due debts, but stated
under a section for additional comments, “My credit is not what it ever has been. It is very
bad because I could not secure a job. I now have a job and the means to rectify all my
shortcomings with my credit.” (Item 2.)
As of November 24, 2018, Applicant’s credit record showed that, between August
2017 and December 2017, he stopped paying on some credit-card accounts that were
subsequently charged off or placed for collection for $17,983 (SOR ¶ 1.a); $6,632 (SOR ¶
1.b); $2,844 (SOR ¶ 1.e); $1,993 (SOR ¶ 1.f); $1,352 (not alleged); $576 (SOR ¶ 1.g); and
$516 (SOR ¶ 1.h). A credit-card account opened in April 2016 had been charged off in
April  2018  for  $7,880  (not  alleged).  Applicant  was  90  days  past  due  on  a  credit-card
account with a $5,276 balance (SOR ¶ 1.c). He was 60 days past due on a credit-card
account with a $4,436 balance (SOR ¶ 1.d). The first major delinquency on that account
was  in  March  2019.  He was 30 days past due on a credit-card account with a $6,836
balance  (not  alleged)  as  of  November  2018.  He  and  his  spouse  were  timely  in  their
mortgage  payments  on  their  loan  balance  of  $319,735.  He  was  also  making  timely
payments of $284 per month on the vehicle loan acquired in November 2016. (Item 4.)
On February 27, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by the OPM investigator. When
asked about his finances, Applicant related that he had defaulted on six credit-card debts,
but he did not think they had been charged off. When confronted about specific debts,
Applicant stated that his financial situation had improved and was good. He recognized the
debts in the SOR, except for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b, and expressed a willingness to pay his
debts that were delinquent. He cited lack of work from December 2017 to November 2018
as the reason for his past-due balances, and added that he had made some progress
toward  addressing  his  debts  by  paying  off  a  $3,500  personal  loan.  He  was  given  an
opportunity by the OPM investigator to provide documentation about his delinquencies
during and after his PSI. There is no evidence that he submitted any documentation. (Item
3.)
As of May 3, 2019, Applicant had made no progress toward resolving his delinquent
debts. To the contrary, the credit-card account in SOR ¶ 1.d, which had been 60 days past
due only months before, had been charged off for $4,956. His creditors were reporting
charged-off balances of $17,983 (SOR ¶ 1.a); $7,880 (not alleged); $6,632 (SOR ¶ 1.b);
$5,577 (SOR ¶ 1.c); $2,844 (SOR ¶ 1.e); $1,993 (SOR ¶ 1.f); $1,352 (not alleged); and
$576 (SOR ¶ 1.g). A $516 debt was in collection status (SOR ¶ 1.h). (Item 5.)  In June
2019, the creditor owed the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c placed a $5,495 balance for collection. (Item
6.)
In February 2019, Applicant obtained a vehicle loan for $13,025. In July 2019, he
obtained a $14,386 loan from a motorcycle retailer. In November 2019, he and his spouse
sold their home and paid off their mortgage loan balance of $310,502. (Item 6.) It is unclear
how  much  they  received  for  their  house,  but  they  took  the  equity  and  paid  off  the
motorcycle loan in November 2019. Applicant also paid off his two vehicle loans acquired
in  November  2016  and  February  2019  with  final  payments  of  $5,958  and  $12,243  in
November 2019. (Item 6.)
Applicant was issued an SOR on November 20, 2020. In response, Applicant stated
that, in addition to having sold a truck to reduce their debts, they sold their home, which
gave them the funds to pay off some debts that had not been charged off. Two creditors,
who had been owed charged-off balances of $7,880 and $1,352 (not alleged in SOR),
allowed him to settle those debts. (Items 1, 6.) Applicant explained that he had secured
new employment and had relocated for the income to meet his financial obligations and
save for the future. He stated that his military retirement income was sufficient to cover the
costs for his residence. (Item 1.) He provided no details about his retirement income or any
deductions from that income.
As of January 4, 2021, Equifax was reporting that Applicant and his spouse had
obtained  a  30-year  mortgage  loan  for  $181,041  with  a  repayment  term  of  $1,354  per
month. They were making those mortgage payments on time. Applicant was also making
timely payments on a credit-card account opened in July 2020 with a $1,200 credit limit.
However, he had made no payments toward the delinquencies in the SOR. (Item 6.)
In response to the FORM, Applicant stated that his current credit score is 620 or
better and climbing. He asserted that all of his debts have been paid off except for a few
accounts that he has been advised to keep to sustain a good credit rating. He stated that,
in 2019, he retained the services of a bankruptcy lawyer to handle his debt repayments for
him. However, after a few months of making small payments (amount not disclosed) to the
lawyer,  Applicant  elected  to  handle  his  debts  on  his  own.  He  related,  without  any
corroborating  documentation,  that  he  contacted  those  creditors  for  whom  he  had
addresses, sold what he and his spouse had, downsized, and did his best to pay off what
he  could.  He  stated  that  he  paid  off  some  “discharged  notes” and  was working  with  a
creditor  to  eliminate  another  debt.  He  attributed  his financial  issues  to  an  “instance  of
misfortune,” and maintained that he is correcting his debts over time. (AE A.)
Applicant provided no evidence of any payments toward the debts in the SOR. All of
the SOR debts but the debt in SOR 1.e had outstanding balances on his January 2021
credit report. Those debts totaled $38,151. (Item 6.) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.e had been
dropped from his credit report, but there is no evidence the $2,844 charge-off balance had
been resolved. Applicant provided no information about his present income or any details
about his budget other than that he “always had a budget and stuck with it for the most
part.”  He  asserts  that  he  has  always  lived  within  his  means.  He  has  had  some  credit
counseling “with Quicken loans referral,” but he did not elaborate in that regard. (AE A.)
