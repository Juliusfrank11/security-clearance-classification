In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the  three SOR allegations, which
include  her  failure  to  timely  file:  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  (TY)  2013
through  2019  (¶  1.a);  income  tax  returns  for  state  “A” for  TYs  2013  and  2014  (¶  1.b);
and  income  tax  returns  for  state  “B”  for  TYs  2014  through  2019  (¶  1.c).  Her  SOR
admissions, and those in her answers to the FORM and the documents submitted, are
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I
make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is 31 years old. She graduated from high school in 2008, and attended
college between 2008 and 2011, but did not earn a degree. Her 2019 SCA work history
indicates  she  has  been  employed  since  2012  with  various  employers.  She  started
working  for  her  current  employer,  a  federal  contractor  and  her  clearance  sponsor,  in
January 2019. This is her first clearance application. She married in 2010 and divorced
in  2017.  She  has  no  children.  The  2019  SCA  indicates  she  has  been  living  with  a
cohabitant since February 2018.
In  response  to  questions  in  Section  26  (Financial  Record)  of  her  2019  SCA,
Applicant stated that she had failed to file federal and state income tax returns for TYs
2013  through  2019,  and  had  failed  to  pay  her  federal  and  state  income  taxes  as
required. She explained that her filing of those income tax returns was delayed for many
different  reasons.  In  2013,  her  husband  left  her  and  she  forgot  to  file  her  income  tax
return. She was living by herself and having a rough time with her divorce, and she was
making  sure  she  could  live  on  her  own.  In  2014,  she  was  living  on  her  own  and  had
back-to-back high electric bills that had to be paid, and she could not afford to get her
taxes  done.  In  2015,  2016  and  2017,  she  was  living  with  her  grandmother  and  taking
care of her financially and medically and pushed back her tax filing to make sure basic
necessities  were  provided,  because  she  was  not  making  enough  money  to  pay  her
taxes and her living expenses. In 2018 and 2019, she was working with an accountant
to get her taxes resolved.
During  her  September  2019  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  interview,
Applicant  reiterated  her  2019  SCA  explanations  for  her  failure  to  file  her  income  tax
returns. She stated her current financial situation was not great, but she was working on
it.  She  indicated  her  willingness  and  ability  to  pay  her  debts,  and  promised  to  file  her
delinquent  income  tax  returns  and  to  pay  her  delinquent  taxes.  She  stated  she  would
make changes when she marries in October 2019. She believed her fiancé would take
care  of  her  finances  and  help  her  resolve  her  tax  problems.  As  of  the  date  of  her
interview, she had not participated in financial counseling.
In her two April 2021 responses to the FORM, Applicant submitted documentary
evidence showing that in April 2021, she retained a bookkeeping firm to help her file her
delinquent income tax returns. The firm prepared and submitted Applicant’s federal and
state income tax returns for TYs 2012 through 2020 in April 2021, except for the state
TY 2014 income tax return that was not filed because she was missing her W-2.
According  to  her  income  tax  returns,  Applicant  anticipates  receiving  refunds  for
TYs 2012, 2013, 2014, 2018, 2019, and 2020. She issued checks to pay owed taxes for
TY  2015  ($921);  TY  2016  ($1,236);  and  TY  2017  ($170).  She  acknowledged  that  the
IRS still has to accept her filings and that she will likely owe an undetermined amount of
money to the IRS for applicable penalties and interest charges.
In her April 2021 responses to the FORM, Applicant stated that she has learned
a hard lesson as a result of her tax problems and the clearance process. She promised
to timely file her federal and state income tax returns in the future and to expeditiously
pay  any  owed  taxes.  She  noted  that  she  has  been  honest  and  upfront  during  the
security  clearance  process  and  disclosed  her  tax  deficiencies  in  her  2019  SCA.  She
believes  that  filing  her  tax  returns  and  paying  her  taxes  will  show  she  no  longer  will
repeat the same mistakes, and that she is not a security risk.
Applicant  did  not  present  evidence  of  her  current  financial  situation  (gross
monthly  income,  deductions,  monthly  expenses,  and  monthly  net  remainder).  She  did
not present evidence to show that she has a working budget. There is no evidence to
show she has had recent financial counseling.
