In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  she  admitted  the  five  student  loans  referred  for
collection  (in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b-1.d  and  1.i,  and  1.o).  Applicant  denied  the  remaining  13
delinquent  medical  accounts,  claiming  that  these  debts  had  been  discharged  through
bankruptcy. Her admissions are accepted as a finding of fact.
Applicant is 30 years old. She served in the Army National Guard from January
2009 until January 2015, at which time she received an honorable discharge. During her
service,  she  held  a  DOD  security  clearance.  In  April  2016,  she  earned  an  associate’s
degree. She currently resides with a cohabitant and her daughter, age 6. She is employed
as a massage therapist earning about $2,500 a month. She has been offered a position
with a DOD contractor as an imagery analyst, but her employment is contingent upon her
obtaining a DOD security clearance.  (Tr. 19-20, 29, 37-38; GE 1)
Financial Considerations
Applicant attributed her financial delinquencies to various medical issues and an
unexpected  hospitalization  while  without  medical  insurance.  In  January  2015,  she
suffered from  a  gallbladder attack  while  drilling for the Army National Guard.  She  was
taken to the hospital and her gallbladder was removed. Although she believed she was
covered by Tricare insurance, she later discovered that her Tricare medical coverage was
denied. She did not challenge the Tricare denial of coverage and she was held personally
responsible for the medical debt totaling approximately $36,000. Between 2012 and 2018,
she incurred additional medical debts totaling approximately $14,000 while uninsured. In
November 2020, a lawsuit was filed against her to recover the $36,000 in unpaid medical
expenses related to her gallbladder surgery. Shortly thereafter, Applicant filed for Chapter
7  bankruptcy  protection,  listing  approximately  $50,000  in  medical  debt  and  $13,000  in
delinquent  student  loans.  Her  March  2021  bankruptcy  discharge  included  all  of  her
medical debt. Her student loans are currently in forbearance until September 2021, due
to  the  Covid-19  pandemic.  Applicant  testified  that  her  car  loan  will  be  paid  in  full  in
September 2021, and it is her intention to use the extra $260 to start paying on her student
loans thereafter. (Tr. 12, 21-23, 25, 28, 38-41; AE A, AE B)
Applicant completed the financial counseling required by her bankruptcy filing  in
December  2020.  She  learned  from  the  counseling  that  she  needed  to  monitor  her
spending habits and create a practical monthly budget. She is in the process of rebuilding
her savings account. The father of her daughter provides $400 in monthly support. She
has filed all Federal and state income tax returns. (Tr. 30-31, 35-37)
Applicant provided three character reference letters from friends, who described
her as dedicated, trustworthy, and a person of integrity. Her friends assert that she would
be a valuable asset to any organization or employer. (AE C, AE D, AE E)
