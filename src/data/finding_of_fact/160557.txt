The SOR alleges that, as of January 25, 2021, Applicant was past due $2,530 on a
loan balance of $9,678 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and that he owed charged-off debts of $20,337 (SOR
¶ 1.b), $17,877 (SOR ¶ 1.c), and $3,688 (SOR ¶ 1.d). (Item 1.) When he answered the
SOR allegations, Applicant stated that he had not been delinquent on the accounts before
he  sought  debt-consolidation  assistance  from  a  company  that  told  him  to  close  the
accounts and stop making payments because the company would be handling settlements
and payments for him. He asserted that he started a debt-relief program in February 2019;
that the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c had been resolved; and that the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d
and 1.b would be paid off by March 2021 and October 2021, respectively.
Applicant’s admissions to the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are accepted and
incorporated in the record as factual findings. After considering the FORM, consisting of
Items  1  through  8,  and  Applicant’s  FORM  Response,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant is 51-years-old, married, and the father of a teenage daughter. Applicant
reports that he served honorably in the U.S. military from May 1997 to November 2010,
and was a staff sergeant from December 2008 until his discharge. Applicant held a DOD
security clearance, up to the level of top secret, while on active duty. (Item 4.) Available
service records reflected discrepant information about a reserve enlistment in February
2012 and general discharge under honorable conditions in September 2014, which he
denies.  He  explained  to  an  OPM  investigator  during  his  June  2020  PSI  that  he  had
attempted to re-enlist but was denied for medical reasons, and that his service record is
inaccurate in some aspects. (Item 5.)
Applicant was unemployed from December 2010 to June 2013, while pursuing his
undergraduate degree online. He supported himself in part on Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) education benefits. He earned his bachelor’s degree in June 2013, and in July
2013, he started his current employment in computer support with a defense contractor.
(Items 4-5.) He states that he has held a security clearance for “over 23 years.” (Item 3.)
Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on May
27, 2020. In response to an SF 86 financial record inquiry concerning whether he was
currently seeking assistance for financial difficulties, Applicant disclosed that he was on a
“debt consolidation” program, and explained:
I went in the program with no delinquency with 2 loans and 2 credit cards. I
am currently paying semi-monthly payments to the agency which they are
working with the creditors. I have recently completed resolving and paying off
one  of  the  loans.  This  program  is really helping me  get  back  to  financial
stability. I am currently in good standing with all my expenses and bills which
I just completed paying off one of my car[s]. (Item 4.)
As of June 10, 2020, Applicant had four delinquent accounts on his credit record. An
unsecured loan obtained for $8,910 in November 2018 became delinquent in April 2019
and  was  $2,530  past  due  on  a  balance  of  $9,678  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  A  credit-card  account
opened with a retailer in April 2017 became delinquent in April 2019 and was charged off
for $20,337 in October 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.b). A joint unsecured loan opened by Applicant and
his  spouse  with  a  credit  union  in  December  2017  was  charged  off  for  $17,877  in
September 2019 after no payments since March 2019. The creditor filed a lawsuit against
Applicant  and  his spouse  for the  debt  on  July 1,  2019.  (Item  8.)  As  of  April 2020,  the
creditor  was  reporting  an  outstanding  balance  of  $21,633  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  A  credit-card
account  Applicant  opened  in  December  2017  was  charged  off.  As  of  May  2020,  the
creditor was reporting a balance of $3,688 (SOR ¶ 1.d). (Items 6-7.) Applicant was making
timely payments on three credit cards with respective balances of $372, $206, and $2. He
and his spouse were making payments of $528 per month on a joint vehicle loan obtained
for $36,768 in March 2017. As of May 2020, the loan balance was $20,053. In October
2019, he paid off a $15,935 auto loan obtained in July 2014. He had been past due 30
days three times on that loan. (Item 6.)
When asked about his finances during his June 19, 2020 PSI, Applicant explained
that he and his spouse wanted to become debt free in preparation for retirement, so in the
summer  [sic]  of  2019,  he  began  a  debt-consolidation  program.  The  debt-resolution
company told him to stop payments on the accounts in the program. He understood from
the debt-resolution company that his credit report would reflect past-due balances while the
company negotiated settlements with his creditors. Applicant asserted that he was paying
the debt-resolution company $767 a month in return for the company disbursing payments
to the accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d. However, available information shows that the creditor
in SOR ¶ 1.c sought a judgment against Applicant and his spouse in July 2019. (Item 8.) If
that debt had been initially enrolled in the program, the creditor was unwilling to accept a
negotiated settlement. Applicant characterized his financial situation as good otherwise,
and he expressed the willingness and ability to repay his past-due debts. He presented no
documentation to the investigator regarding the status of the delinquent accounts, even
though he was provided an opportunity to do so both during and after his interview. (Item
5.)
On December 23, 2020, Applicant and his spouse paid $17,892 in full settlement of
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c outside of the debt-relief program. (Item 3.) On January 8, 2021, the
creditor moved to dismiss its case against Applicant and his spouse. A jury trial scheduled
for July 7, 2021, was vacated. (Item 8.) As of March 12, 2021, Equifax was reporting the
debt as “paid charge off” in January 2021 with a zero balance. (Item 7.)
On  January  25,  2021,  the  DCSA  issued  an  SOR  to  Applicant  because  of  the
delinquencies  on  two  credit-card  accounts  and  two  unsecured  loans.  (Item  1.)  When
Applicant responded to the SOR on February 5, 2021, he reiterated that he had not been
delinquent in his payments before he entered the debt-relief program in February 2019,
and that he had stopped paying on the accounts on the advice of the debt-resolution firm.
He indicated that he had paid off the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c, and that the other two
debts were being repaid through the debt-relief program into which he was then paying
$549 semi-monthly. He stated that he had learned from that situation, was living within his
means and wiser in managing his debts. Applicant provided documentation from the debt-
resolution company confirming he had enrolled in a debt-relief program on February 8,
2019, and, as of February 4, 2021, he was “scheduled to make regular deposits of $549”
for the purpose of paying off his enrolled debts (then SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b and 1.d). Payment
records from the debt-relief program show that he was offered a settlement of $2,864 on
May 24, 2019, to resolve the $9,548 balance of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a, and that the debt
was resolved through payments from June 2019 through April 2020. He also provided
documentation showing that he had paid $17,892 outside the program in full settlement of
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c. (Item 3.)
As  of  March  2021,  the  unsecured  loan  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  was  no  longer  on
Applicant’s credit record. The creditor in SOR ¶ 1.b was reporting a past-due balance of
$15,250,  and  a  recent  payment  on  the  account  in  February  2021  (Item  7),  which
corroborates  Applicant’s  account  that  the  debt  was  being  paid  through  the  debt-relief
program.  The  creditor in  SOR  ¶  1.d  was  reporting a  balance  of  $1,771  on  Applicant’s
charged-off account with the creditor. Applicant was continuing to make timely payments
on a car loan obtained in March 2017, and he had reduced the balance to $16,213. He had
only one other outstanding credit balance, which was for $842 on credit-card account that
has been current. No balance was owed on his newest credit-card account, which he had
opened in February 2020. (Item 7.)
In its FORM, the Government acknowledged Applicant’s settlement of the debts in
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c, but submits that Applicant did not make a good-faith effort to address
his debts by “strategically defaulting on the [four SOR] debts to negotiate terms that were
more to his favor than the existing terms because he and his wife wanted to become debt
free so that they could plan for retirement.” (FORM)
In response to the FORM, Applicant provided another copy of the debt-resolution
firm’s records showing the settlement of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a for 30% of its balance. He
also provided records showing that the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.d agreed to settle for $2,367
(60% of the balance at settlement) on March 10, 2020, and that the debt was settled in full
through  payments  between  March  27,  2020,  and  February 26,  2021.  Additionally,  the
creditor in SOR ¶ 1.b agreed on August 28, 2020, to settle Applicant’s $20,337 balance for
$10,169 (50% of the balance). Between September 11, 2020 and April 8, 2021, payments
totaling $9,322 ($852 on September 11, 2020, $847 monthly from October 2020 through
March 2021, and $4,235 on April 8, 2021) were made toward the debt. Applicant asserted
in  his  FORM  response  that  the  debt  has  been  “resolved  early  [and  is]  pending  status
change April 8, 2021.” A record from the debt-resolution company shows “8/8 Scheduled
Payments,” but also the debt phase as “in process.” Seven payments of the scheduled
eight show on Applicant’s account with the debt-relief company as of April 8, 2021. (FORM
Response.)
Applicant and his family lived with his in-laws from December 2014 through June
2018.  They  have  rented  an  apartment  since  then.  (Item  4.)  Applicant  provided  no
information about his income or monthly expenses. The monthly obligation on his car loan
is $528. He has been consistent in paying that amount or a little more. His credit report
shows an actual payment of $530. (Item 7.)
