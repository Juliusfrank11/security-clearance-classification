The  SOR  alleges  that,  as  of  February  6,  2020,  Applicant  owed  two  debts  in
collection for $13,846 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and $5,089 (SOR ¶ 1.b); a charged-off debt of $9,431
(SOR ¶ 1.c); and a $13,247 debt that was past due 90 days or more in the amount of
$1,167  (SOR  ¶  1.d).  (Item  1.)  When  he  responded  to  the  SOR  allegations,  Applicant
admitted the debts, but explained that he was paying on them monthly until his now ex-wife
told  him  that  she  had  drained  their  bank  account,  and  that  they  were  several  months
behind on the rent for their lot. Circumstances involving his then wife (a gambling problem
and  a  drunk-driving  offense)  and  other  family  members  (a  father  with  dementia)  led
Applicant  to  relocate  where  he  landed  a  job  making  half  of  his  previous  income.  He
asserted that he was told to ignore the debts in the SOR by an online debt consolidation
company. He claimed without any corroborating documentation that he paid off some other
debts. (Item 2.)
Applicant’s  admissions  to  owing  the  delinquent  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  are
accepted and incorporated in the record as factual findings. After considering the FORM,
consisting of the pleadings (Items 1 and 2) and Government exhibits (Items 3-5), I make
the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 54-year-old high school graduate employed as a truck driver by a
defense contractor since December 2018. Twice married and divorced, he has a 28-year-
old son and a 26-year-old daughter from his first marriage, which ended in July 2012 after
23 years. (Item 3.)
Applicant worked as a material handler for a large pharmaceutical manufacturer
from April 2009 to March 2018. He and his first wife began having marital difficulties, and in
June 2010 he left the family home and moved in with his second wife, whom he married in
March 2013. (Item 3.)
While Applicant was working on third shift, his second wife apparently developed a
gambling problem, drained their bank account, and fell several months behind in paying the
rent  for  their  lot.  With  funds  borrowed  from  his  sister,  Applicant  brought  his  accounts
current  only  for  his  second  wife  to  again  deplete  their  checking  account  due  to  her
gambling. In March 2018, Applicant resigned from his longtime job with the pharmaceutical
company  to  prepare  for  a  planned  relocation  to  care  for  his  father,  who  had  been
diagnosed with dementia. Applicant supported himself on his savings for a few months. In
May 2018, Applicant relocated to his current area and moved in with his parents. He was
unemployed until June 2018, when he began working as a material handler at half of his
previous income. (Items 2-3.) He struggled to pay his bills because of the drastic reduction
in his income after he moved to assist his parents, and he fell behind on some accounts.
(Items 3-5.)
After Applicant relocated to his parents’ home, he and his then wife were separated
until December 2018, when she joined him in their new locale. While living separately from
Applicant for five months, she continued to gamble. Applicant assumed the move would be
good for her because there were no casinos nearby. (Item 2.) In December 2018, Applicant
started working for his current employer, but his wife began gambling on cruise ships. It led
to marital discord and divorce, which was final in November 2019. (Item 2.)
On  April  4,  2019,  Applicant  completed  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security
Positions  (SF  86).  In  response  to  financial  record  inquiries  concerning  delinquency
involving routine accounts, Applicant listed three delinquent debts, reportedly credit-card
debts, for $13,248, $5,089, and $9,432, and explained that, after moving to help care for
his father, he earned less than half his previous income, and so he had difficulty paying his
bills. He reported that he was currently utilizing the services of “an organization online that
had an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau” to help get his debt balances to zero.
He added with respect to the three delinquent accounts listed on his SF 86 that he was
following the directions of the credit-counseling organization. (Item 3.)
As  of  April  18,  2019,  Applicant’s  credit  report  showed  about  the  three  listed
delinquencies  that  the  $13,247  debt  was  the  balance  of  an  unsecured, signature loan
(rather than a credit card) obtained in July 2016 for $20,000 with a credit union. It was
reportedly  past  due  90  days  for  $1,167  (SOR  ¶  1.d).  The  credit-card  account  with  a
collection balance of $5,089 (SOR ¶ 1.b) was opened in February 1999 and rated current
until September 2018. The credit-card account with a charged-off balance of $9,431 (SOR
¶ 1.c) was opened in May 2011 and charged off in March 2019 after seven months of no
payments. Additionally, his credit report reflected a previously undisclosed delinquency with
a credit union. A credit-card account (SOR ¶ 1.a) opened in January 2013 was current until
September  2018.  It  was  placed  for  collection  in  February  2019  and  was  past  due  for
$13,846 as of March 2019. His credit report reflected that he was making timely payments
of $544 per month on a loan for a motorcycle obtained in September 2018 for $30,908.
The loan balance was $26,342 as of March 2019. Applicant owed no other outstanding
debt. He had paid off a $29,923 vehicle loan in May 2018. He was listed as an authorized
user on a credit-card account opened in November 2003. The account was current with a
$227 balance. (Item 5.)
On April 19, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) about the delinquent debts on his credit record.
He admitted the debts, but explained that he had made timely payments before he moved.
The accounts became delinquent due to his lower income after his relocation. He asserted
that he had made a recent payment in January or February 2019 on his signature loan with
a  credit  union,  which  he  initially  correctly  identified  as  the  account  having  a  $13,247
balance, although he later confused that account with his $13,846 credit-card debt with the
same credit union (SOR ¶ 1.a). (Item 4.)
Concerning efforts to resolve his debts, Applicant stated without any corroborating
evidence that he made payments when he could. Applicant indicated that he contacted an
online debt consolidation company to resolve his delinquent debts in lieu of resorting to
bankruptcy  and  that  he  was  paying  the  company  “$394  or  $364  each  month”  for
approximately the past eight to ten months. He added that he was struggling to make his
$400 monthly payment on the signature loan each month and that he planned to contact
the credit union about possibly lowering his monthly payment. Applicant stated he had not
received any financial counseling. He was given the opportunity to provide documentation
about his financial delinquencies and his debt consolidation plan. The OPM investigator
received no documentation from Applicant in that regard. (Item 4.)
In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  the  four  alleged  delinquencies.  He
explained that his second wife had gambled away the money in their checking account;
that she had been jailed and served probation for a second drunk-driving offense before
they moved; that when he relocated, his income was less than half of his prior income; that
while he paid off some bills, the debt consolidation company with whom he was working
told him “to let go” of the accounts listed in the SOR; and that after his wife joined him in
December 2018, she gambled at a casino cruise ship. He related that divorce papers were
filed by August 2018, and his divorce was final in November 2018. (Item 2.) Applicant did
not list on his April 2019 SF 86 that he and his now ex-wife were separated or divorced.
(Item 3.) In all likelihood, he was divorced in November 2019.
Applicant  did  not  provide  any  specifics  about  his  current  income  or  monthly
expenses. His latest address of record is different from the address listed on his SF 86,
where he was residing with his parents and apparently contributing to the expenses of his
parents’ residence. (Item 4.) It is unclear when he moved and whether he pays rent or a
mortgage at his current address.
