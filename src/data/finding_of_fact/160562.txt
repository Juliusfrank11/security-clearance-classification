After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  45  years  old,  never  married,  and  has  no  children.  He  attended  a
vocational school in 2011 and received a commercial driver’s license. Since June 2018,
Applicant has lived with a cohabitant in the state where he was born.  He has two adult
sisters, who also live in that state. Since September 2018, Applicant has been employed
by a defense contractor. (Item 3.)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  11  delinquent  debts  totaling  over  $21,000,
three  of  which  are medical  debts  ($232).  (Item  1.)  Applicant  admitted  those  debts.  He
explained as follows: “[He had] several different major surgeries … [and was] not able to
work due to recovery and rehab time.” Applicant further explained that: “[He had a] heart
attack while at work [that required] major open heart surgery with multiple bypasses being
performed which [he is] now recovering from and attending physical cardiac rehabilitation
until  March-April  of  2021.”  (Item  2.)  The  Government  does  not  contest  or  rebut  those
answers.  (FORM.)  Applicant’s  SOR  delinquencies  began  in  2016  and  2017,  and  they
persist to this day. (Items 4 and 5.)
