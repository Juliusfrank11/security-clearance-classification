In his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e, and denied SOR
¶  1.f,  all  with  explanations.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and
exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 40 years old. His 2019 SCA reflects that he has never married and
has  no  children.  (Item  3)  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  May  2004  and  earned  a
bachelor’s degree in May 2009. (Item 4 at 2)
Applicant worked at a campus bookstore from August 2006 to January 2017, when
the store went out of business. (Item 3 at 12). While at the bookstore full time, he also
worked nights at a retail department store from November 2012 to February 2015, when
he was terminated due to an attendance issue. (Item 3 at 13-14; Item 4 at 2-3) After a
brief period of unemployment in early 2017, he worked as an assistant store manager at
a food store starting in March 2017. (Item 3 at 11)
Applicant’s more recent employment history is unclear. His SCA does not reflect
his current employer, though his file reflects that the SOR was sent to him through the
facility security office of a defense contractor, presumably his sponsor for a clearance.
His  April  2019  interview  summary  contains  no  information  about  his  then-current
employment. (Item 4) Applicant provided no information in his SOR Answer, or since then,
about his recent or current employment or sources of income. (Item 2; AE 1) He has not
previously held a security clearance. (Item 3 at 27)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  incurred  six  delinquent  debts.  They  are
established by his admissions or by the credit reports in the record, both from 2019. (Items
2, 5, 6).
SOR ¶  1.a  is a  student-loan  debt  with  the  U.S. Department of  Education  (USDOE)
that has been  placed  for collection  in  the  approximate  amount of  $37,829. (Items 5, 6) At
the time of his background interview, Applicant owed $63,528 on the debt. (Item  4 at “12
of  12”)  Item  2A, attached  to  Applicant’s  SOR Answer, reflects that as of  March  2,  2020,
Applicant owed  about $67,356  on the  debt. He authorized  a  payment of  $53  to be made
on  March  12, 2020.  (Item  2A)  Applicant noted  in his SOR Answer that he  was in a  10-
month  recovery  plan  to  rehabilitate  the  loan  to  “good-standing” status.  (Item  2) The  record
contains no  documentation  that  the  $53  payment,  or any  others,  were  made  since  March
2020, or that it was to  be part of an agreed-upon, regular payment plan.
SOR ¶  1.b  is a  federal student-loan  debt  with  a  private  student-loan  provider, that,
as of October 2019, was $343  past  due, with  a  total balance  owed  of  $16,807. (Items 5,
6) Item  2B  is a  March  1, 2020  statement  for  this debt.  It  reflects a  principal balance  of
$15,409  and  a  total  balance  due  of $17,169. The  account was in forbearance  status  from
January  to  March 2020. Applicant was on  a  graduated  monthly  payment plan  of $92  a
month  for 24  months, with  monthly  payments to  increase  up  from  $108  to  $276  per month,
over a   timeframe  from   March  2020   until April 2034.  (Item   2B)  Applicant  claimed   in   his
SOR  Answer  that   he   was  in  forbearance   status   because   he   could   not   afford   to   make
payments  on  the  loan.  (Item  2) The  record  contains  no  documentation  that the  first $92,
or  any   other  subsequent  monthly   payments   were  actually   made   on   the   account  since
March 2020.
With respect to Applicant’s federal student loans, I note that due to the COVID-19
pandemic,  the  USDOE  has  been  providing  temporary  relief  on  federal  student  loans,
including suspension of loan payments and collections on defaulted loans. On January
20,  2021,  President  Biden  extended  that  COVID-19  emergency  relief  to  at  least
September 30, 2021.1 These webpages are marked as Administrative Notice (AN) I.
SOR ¶ 1.c ($458) is a charged-off credit-card debt relating to a department store
credit card. (Item 5 at 13; Item 6) The department store is the same store where Applicant
worked the night shift until he was terminated. Applicant notes in his SOR Answer that he
had an arrangement to make $25 monthly payments over six months to settle the debt,
and that he made a $25 payment in late February 2020. Neither the initial $25 payment
nor any other payments are documented in the record.
SOR ¶ 1.d ($1,073) is a cell-phone bill that has been placed for collection. (Item 5
at  12)  Applicant  admitted  the  debt  in  his  SOR  Answer,  but  claimed  that  he  could  not
afford to pay it.
SOR ¶ 1.e ($610) is a debt that has been placed for collection by a bank. (Item 5
at 13) Applicant admitted the debt in his Answer, but claimed that he could not afford to
pay it. (Item 2)
SOR ¶ 1.f ($3,214) is a debt placed for collection by an auto dealer. (Item 5 at 13)
Applicant asserted in his SOR Answer that the debt had been paid off and that he had
provided proof earlier. (Item 2) Among the documents attached to Applicant’s background
interview summary is a document from the auto-dealer creditor reflecting a zero balance,
with  no  money  past  due;  the  last  payment  was  made  on  February  3,  2015,  and  the
account is closed. SOR ¶ 1.f is resolved.
Despite having been given the opportunity to do so, Applicant did not submit any
documentation about the recent or current status of any of his unresolved SOR debts, or
about his income, expenses, assets, or general finances. In AE 1, he said that he had no

2021). (AN I)
additional documents  to  submit,  though  he  evidently attempted  to contact  some  of  his
creditors for such documents, without success. (AE 1)
