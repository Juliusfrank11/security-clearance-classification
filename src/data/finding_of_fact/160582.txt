The SOR alleges three commercial accounts and two student loans. Applicant
admitted all allegations. He indicated that the delinquent debts were caused  by paying
his father’s bills during his father’s surgeries and ensuing treatment in 2011 and 2018.
Even  after  his  father  recovered,  Applicant  continued  to  pay  some  of  his  parents’
delinquent bills. Another reason for the delinquent debts was Applicant’s unemployment
for  about  30  days  in  December  2018,  when  he  was  involuntarily  removed  from  an
employment contract because of a personality clash with another employee. (GE 2, July
2020 answer to SOR; Tr. 26, 28-29, 62)
Applicant  is  38  years  old  and  single.  According  to  his  April  2019  e-QIP,  he
purchased his current residence in December 2010. He earned college credits between
August 2000 and December 2002. In December 2004, he received a bachelor’s degree
in  exercise  science.  He  collected  additional  college  credits  between  August  2007  and
September 2008. He has held several security-officer positions since 2011. He currently
holds  two  security  officer  positions  for  two  different  companies.  Applicant’s  security
clearance,  which  he  received  in  2011,  was  deactivated  at  a  subsequent  security  job
because it was not required. He currently has a public trust clearance and is seeking a
security clearance. (GE 3 at 14-15, 18, 44; Tr. 16, 64)
SOR  ¶¶1.a,  1.c   –   Credit  reports   reflect  that  these   two   student   loans  first
became   delinquent  in   2012.  (GE  4   at  10-11)  After  notifying   the   U.S.  Department  of
Education   (DOE)  that   he   was  interested   in   rehabilitating   his  defaulted   student  loans,
Applicant  received   letters   on   January   25   and   January   28,  2021   from   the   DOE   default
servicing   center  indicating   that   the   delinquent  loan   balance   on   his  two   student  loan
accounts totaled  $37,963.73.  (AE  B; Tr. 18-19)  The  student loan  servicer calculated  his
monthly   repayment  amount  at  $271.  According   to   the   repayment   agreement,   he  was
required  to  make  nine consecutive  payments. The  servicing  center explained  to  him that
compliance   of   the   repayment   agreement  was   a   requirement  for  rehabilitating   the
student loan.  (AE B)
Applicant provided bank statements (AE E, F, and G) displaying repayments for
the student-loan accounts. AE F shows a student loan repayment of $271 was made on
February  5,  2021,  and  posted  on  February  8,  2021.  AE  E  reflects  a  $271  repayment
was made on March 8 and posted on March 9, 2021. AE G indicates a $271 repayment
was  made  on  April  7  and  posted  on  April  8,  2021.  Though  Applicant  has  made  three
successive repayments under the agreement, he has five additional payments to make
to  qualify  for  rehabilitation  of  his  student  loans.  According  to  the  credit  bureau  reports
and  Applicant’s  testimony,  before  his  student  loans  became  delinquent  in  2012,  his
monthly payment was approximately $575 a month. (Tr. 18-19, 32, 66; GE 3 at 47; GE
4 at 5, 10-11; GE 7 at 4, 5; AE B)
Applicant initially testified that he stopped making student-loan payments when
his father had his first surgery in 2011. He indicated that he made occasional payments
on his student loans over the life of the loan, but could not indicate when he made those
payments.  He also was  helping his parents with  their mortgage  and  other bills,  but  he
was unable to provide any specific details. (Tr. 32-35)
SOR  ¶1.b   –   This  is  a   delinquent  credit-card  account  for  $1,304   that  was
opened  in  June  2018, and  reached  a  delinquent status  in September 2018. (GE  4  at 5;
GE   6   at  2;  GE   8)  In   June   2019,   the   government  investigator  advised   Applicant  of   the
three  commercial debts. He  settled  this  account  on  December 31,  2020. (Tr.  38-39,  44;
AE A)
SOR ¶1.d  –  This is a  security- camera-company  account ($1,174) that was sold
to  a  collection  company  in June  2019. (GE 4  at 11)  Applicant assumed  he  had  settled
the   account,   only   to   discover  he   had   two   accounts.  On   January   16,  2020,   Applicant
settled the account  for $500. (Tr. 41-43; AE J)
SOR  ¶   1.e   –   This  was  a   credit-card  account  ($692)  that  Applicant  opened   in
January 2018, and the account became delinquent in June 2019. He paid the  account in
September 2019. (Tr. 39-40; AE H)
According to his security clearance application and his testimony, except for a
30-day  period  in  December  2018,  Applicant  has  been  steadily  employed  since  2010,
and has earned approximately $130,000 a year since 2010. (Tr. 22, 26-30)
Because  of  the  pandemic,  Applicant  suspended  paying  his  $1,468  monthly
mortgage in June 2020, so that he could catch up on his other bills. However, the other
bills did not include the delinquent student loans listed in the SOR.  (Tr. 44) One of the
other  bills  was  a  utility  bill.  He  skipped  about  seven  monthly  utility  payments
necessitating a large payment of over $1,600 in January 2021. (Tr. 45-48; AE F at 5)
Applicant  described  his  retirement  account  as  a  retirement-savings  account
where  $700  a  month  was  automatically  deducted  from  his  paycheck  for  the  past  five
years. For some unexplained reason, he stopped the automatic deduction recently and
makes  the  monthly  deposits  himself.  His  personal  financial  statement  (PFS),  dated
January 27, 2021, indicates that his net monthly remainder after his monthly expenses
and debts are subtracted from his monthly income, is $4,382. (Tr. 48-50)
In  February  2021,  Applicant  invested  in  stocks  for  the  first  time.  He  made  a
$2,000  investment  in  a  stock  on  the  recommendation  of  a  friend.  He  stated,  “I  really
don’t know much about it. I just started [it].” (Tr. 50; AE F)
A  review  of  Applicant’s bank statements (AE  E, F, and  G) reflect a  number  of
transactions that are large in amount. On March 1, 2021, Applicant loaned $1,000 to a
coworker who is also a friend. The friend “was going through something and he wanted
help.”  (Tr.  54;  AE  E)  Applicant  loaned  the  same  friend  $1,000  in  April  2021,  and
explained that he loaned money to this coworker whenever he needed help. He did not
know why he loaned the money, but speculated the coworker had bills or issues with his
house. (Tr. 51-56)
Applicant  described  a financial-counseling  service  in  his  April  2019  e-QIP.  He
indicated  that  he  was  working  with  a  credit  service  to  learn  about  improving  and
managing  his  credit  more  effectively.  He  testified  that  he  may  have  provided  the
counseling statement, but claimed that he did not remember, even though he made the
statement  only  two  years  before  the  April 2021  hearing.  Though he  indicated  in  same
April  2019  e-QIP  that  he  had  a  $477-a-month  payment  arrangement  with  the  federal
agency to repay his student loans, he could not remember the arrangement because “I
spoke  to  student  loans  [agency]  several  times.”  He  again  referred  to  the  passage  of
time as clouding his memory. (Tr. 66)
