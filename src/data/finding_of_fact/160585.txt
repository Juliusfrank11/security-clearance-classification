Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since 2017. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1994
until  he  was  honorably  discharged  in  1996.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree  that  was
awarded in 1999 and a master’s degree that he earned in 2007. He has never married,
and he has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 15, 17, 38-39; Applicant’s response to SOR;

Applicant  has  a  problematic  history,  primarily  related  to  the  workplace.  He  also
had  legal  and  financial  issues.  He  worked  for  a  state  government  in  information
technology  (IT)  from  2002  through  2008.  He  was  placed  on  administrative  leave  from
about  December  2007  until  he  was  terminated  in  about  February  2008.  Applicant  felt
that  he  was  wrongfully  terminated.  He  stated  that  he  was  sexually  harassed  by  a
supervisor,  and  that  his  suspension  and  termination  could  have  been  related  to  his
rebuffs  of  his  supervisor.  Applicant  retained  an  attorney  to  file  a  wrongful  termination
case,  but  he  decided  not  to  pursue  it  after  he  was  hired  at  another  job.  (Tr.at  18-21;
Applicant’s  response  to  SOR;  GE  1,  2)  He  wrote  in  his  Questionnaire  for  National
Security Positions (SF 86):
The  issue  of  wrongful termination  stemmed  from  a  day  I was out sick and
the  supervisor gave  an  office, which he  promised  to  give  to  me  on  multiple
occasions, to  a  person  who  had  only  been  with  us  a  month  or so, I  moved
my   stuff   into   the   office   and   put  her  stuff   into   my   old  office.  The   following
Monday   I  was  told   to  move   my   stuff   back or else,   so   I   complied   with   the
request.  Some  things were said and  the  next thing  I know  I am  getting  an
administrative   leave   letter   which  does   not even   state   why   I  am   being   put
on leave.
Applicant  worked  for  a  defense  contracting  company  from  2009  until  he  was
terminated in 2015. He received a verbal warning in April  2014 for his attendance and
unprofessional  behavior.  He  received  a  written  warning  in  June  2014  for  continued
attendance issues and for a verbal disagreement that resulted in the customer’s request
to have Applicant temporarily removed from the facility. The written warning also stated
that  Applicant  openly  criticized  management,  used  profanity,  and  made  inappropriate
comments. (Tr. at 22; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3)
Applicant received  a  final  written  warning  in July  2014. He  had  an  inappropriate
dialogue  with  the  company’s customer by  criticizing  their  decision about  his  training.  He
was terminated  in March  2015  after he  sent an  inappropriate  email  to  a  military  service
member using   his   military   email   account,   in  which  he   asked  the   service  member for a
date.  (Tr. at 22-27; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE  1-3)
Applicant stated that he worked for the company for six years, and  he had a good
record at the company for five years, until he  received a new manager who  was not very
professional.  Applicant  stated   that  there   were   “personality   conflicts”  with   the   new
manager.  He  stated   that  his  attendance   was  always   good.  He  admitted   sending   the
email   to   the   service  member, but   he   stated   that   he   just   asked   her   to   lunch,   and   there
was nothing rude  or inappropriate  about the  email. (Tr. at 22-27; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE  1, 2)
Applicant  worked  for  a  company  from  about  June  2016  to  August  2016.  He
received a written warning in July 2016 for a misconfigured production server. Applicant
stated that his supervisor did not provide him with guidance on the correct configuration
of the server. Applicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) in August 2016.
He was still a probationary employee, and he was terminated after he reported the DWI
to  his  employer.  He  stated  that  he  stopped  drinking  after  the  DWI.  (Tr.  at  27-28,  38;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant met a  woman  in  2015. She  suggested  they  be  just  friends and  go  into
business  together   selling   items  that  were  manufactured   in  China.  He  still   had   feelings
for her and  agreed. He signed  an  agreement,  but she  did  not. He withdrew  funds  from
his 401(k)  retirement  account  and  gave  her  money. She  convinced  him  that  she  needed
to   move   to   a   larger  metropolitan   area   to   sell   her  goods.   He  paid  her  rent  $3,600-per-
month  rent  and  also paid for a  trip  to  Europe  for her to  sell  her  goods. Applicant finally
realized  that she  was a  con  artist, and  he had  been  scammed  of  about $100,000.  (Tr. at
30-37; GE  2
Applicant did  not pay  the  IRS  and  his state  all  the  taxes owed  when  he  withdrew
the  funds from  his 401(k). For tax  year 2015,  he  owed  $41,315  in federal taxes, and  his
withholding   was  $9,665,  leaving   a   balance   in  excess  of   $31,000.  The   IRS   applied
$3,904  from  his 2016  refund  and  $2,528  from  his 2017  refund  to  the  amount owed  for
2015.  The   IRS   accepted   Applicant’s  offer in  compromise.   He  paid   $19,000   in  January
2017, and  the  IRS wrote off the balance of  $8,821 in June 2018.  (Tr. at 37-40; GE  1, 2)
Applicant also accrued more than $35,000 in credit card and other debt. He filed
a  Chapter 7 bankruptcy case  in  January 2017,  and his debts  were  discharged in April
2017. He stated that his finances are currently in good shape. (Tr. at 35-37; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  does  not  believe   he   is  a   security   risk.  He  asserted   that   his  security
clearance  should  not  be  denied  “based  solely  on  a  few  bad  bosses.” He stated  that  he
has  always  been   diligent   about   protecting   sensitive   information,  and   he   is  highly
regarded   by   his  current  employer,  where  he   has  worked   for   four  years.  (Tr.  at  48-50;
Applicant’s response  to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant submitted  submitted documents and letters from high school, his time
in the military, when he worked for the employers that terminated him in 2008 and 2015,
and at his current employment. He is praised for his excellent work performance, moral
character,
friendly  and  calm  demeanor,  courtesy,  dedication,  work  ethic,  and
professionalism.  He  was  described  by  his  supervisor  in  2013  as  “an  ideal  employee.”
