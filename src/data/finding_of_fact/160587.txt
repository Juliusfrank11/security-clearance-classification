Applicant attributed her delinquent debts to a number of difficulties and problems
beginning  in  2008  and  continuing  through  2017.  In  July 2008,  her spouse  ended  their

she provided some care for him. In remission, he decided to abandon Applicant in 2012,
and provided no financial support to her. (Item A, Response to FORM)
Applicant  enrolled  in  a  debt  relief  program  in  October  2018,  so  that  she  could

dates  and  completion  amounts.  She  has  consistently  made  payments  to  this  debt
consolidation program since April 2020. (Item  7) The supporting documentation shows
these  payments  totaled  about  $8,033  over  the  past  year.  (Item  7)  In  her  response  to
FORM (Item A), Applicant claimed she has paid approximately $16,000 toward her debt
consolidation  since  October  2018.  However,  there  is  no  specific  documentation  in  the
file to support this.

(Attachment to answer to SOR)
As to SOR 1.g, a charged-off account in the amount of $1,020, Applicant settled
the account in 2020 for $459.33, and provided general documentation not connected to
a specific creditor.
As  to  SOR  1.h,  a  collection  account  in  the  amount  of  $1,035,  Applicant  settled
the  account  for  $517.59,  and  provided  general  documentation  not  connected  to  a

consolidation  program  since  2020.  (Item  7)  Her  supporting  documentation  shows  that
these  payments  totaled  about  $8,033  over  the  past  year.  (Item  7)  Applicant  provided
documents  that  showed  she  had  resolved  eleven  (11)  delinquent  financial  accounts
through  the  debt  relief  program.  Counsel  does  not  dispute  this  statement.  As  shown

(Item 8)
However, in her April 4, 2019 security clearance application, Applicant admitted
that she had significant financial issues totaling over $30,000. She had been denied  a
security  clearance  based  on  financial  issues  in  2016,  but  did  not  enroll  in  the  debt
consolidation until 2018. She made a settlement agreement with each creditor and paid
money to them each month. (Answer to Response to FORM)
Credit  bureau  report,  dated  April  20,  2021  (Item  4)  shows  “pays  as  agreed”  or
settled for less than original balance for each account, with zero balance due. She has
no other delinquent accounts on that credit bureau reports. (Item 4 Credit bureau report,
dated April 25, 2019, (Item 6) shows past-due-amounts for various SOR accounts and
accounts that are “charged off”.
Payments in various amounts are listed to the debt consolidation company from
November 2020 until March 2021. (Item 7) Again, in (Item 8) a chart lists the agreement
amounts but does not show which creditor was paid. In her defense, Applicant did ask
for such a document, but did not receive anything. (Item 8)
Applicant  has  been  gainfully  employed  since  2008  and  received  various
promotions.  There  is  no  information  in  the  record  concerning  her  salary,  use  of  a
financial counselor, budget or income.
