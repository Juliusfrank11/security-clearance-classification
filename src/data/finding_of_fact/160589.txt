Applicant  is a 36-year-old  software  tester for a  defense  contractor  who  seeks a
security clearance. The admitted  allegations are incorporated and adopted as relevant
and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant  has  never  married  or  entered  into  a  legally  recognized  domestic
partnership and has no children. (GE 1) She cohabited with another between 2016 and
October  2020.  (GEs  1  and  12)  Applicant  earned  a  high  school  diploma  and  attended
some  college  classes  without  earning  a  degree  or  diploma.  (Tr.  24,  62-63)  Her
completed  post-college  classes  include  defense  courses  related  to  cyber-security  and
understanding how to handle classified and unclassified information. (Tr. 63)  Applicant
reported no military service.
Since   August  2018,  Applicant  has  been   employed   by   her   current  defense
contractor   as  a   software  tester.  (GE   1;  Tr.    71,  109)  Previously,  she   worked   for  other
non-defense  employers in various jobs  (mostly  in the  restaurant industry). (GE  1; Tr. 64,
70) She has never held a security clearance. (GE 1)
Applicant’s history of  alcohol-related and  other-traffic-related offenses
Between  2007  and  2018,  Applicant  was  involved  in  a  number  of  traffic-related
offenses. One of the incidents was alcohol-related that resulted in her arrest  in August
2011 for driving under the influence (DUI). Arrest records confirm that she was charged
with DUI in August 2011 (GEs 1 and 4), pled guilty, was fined $250, and was sentenced
to  probation before  judgment.  (GE  4) Her  probation  conditions  included  suspension  of
her driving privileges  for 30  days  and  avoidance of  any repetitive  behavior.  (GE  4;  Tr.
95-96)  Upon  satisfaction  of  her  probation  conditions,  the  DUI  charges  were  court-
dismissed  without  judgment.  (Tr.  96-97,159)  Since  her  2011  DUI,  Applicant  rarely
consumes alcohol and has never been charged with another DUI offense. (Tr. 97)
Records  document  that  between  July  2007  and  January  2016,  Applicant  was
charged  with  driving  on  a  suspended  license  on  six  separate  occasions  (2007,  2008,
2012-2013, and 2015-2016. (GEs 1-2 and 4-8; Tr. 90-95) When she failed to appear on
these  traffic-related  arrests  and  charges,  the  presiding  courts  issued  bench  warrants
and license suspensions.  Most of the time, she did not appear for her scheduled court
hearings  due  to  memory  lapses  and  her  failures  to  open  her  mail,  but  on  a  few
occasions, the warrant notices did not reach her at her new addresses. (Tr. 78-87, 177)
Applicant  never  requested  any  of  the  presiding  courts  to  place  one  or  more  of  the
individual cases on the stet dockets. (Tr. 144-145)
While  driving  home  in  May  2018,  Applicant  was  stopped  and  charged  with
knowingly  driving  an  uninsured  vehicle  and  driving  a  vehicle  on  a  highway  with  a
suspended registration.  (GEs 1 and 9; Tr. 97-99, 109, 159) For cited lack of monetary
resources to cover her insurance billings, she avoided opening her mail and continued
to  drive  her  vehicle  back  and  forth  to  work  for  over  eight  months  before  she  was
stopped  and  charged.  (Tr.  101-102,  157,182)  When  she  appeared  in  court  to  answer
the charges, she was released by the court without any jail time. (Tr. 94) Applicant has
more income now and promised to avoid driving in the future should she lack insurance
and to faithfully attend scheduled  hearings  should she  ever be  issued a  citation  in the
future. (Tr. 158)
Appearing   in  court   to   answer  the   pending   driving   an   uninsured   vehicle   on   a
suspended  registration, she  pled  guilty, was fined  $2,400  (covered  by  a  court-approved
payment   plan),   and   was  sentenced   to   probation   before   judgment.   (GEs  9   and   11;   Tr.
108)   Probation   conditions  included   insuring   her  vehicle,  updating   her  registration,
performing   community   service,  and   completing   her  already-enrolled   substance   abuse
program. (GE 11) Applicant is credited  with  satisfying  her court-approved  payment plan
and  successfully   completing   all   of   the   requirements  of   her  substance   abuse   program
and other imposed  probation  conditions. (GEs 2  and  4  and  AE  G;  Tr. 40, 108-109, and
159) Pending charges were dismissed. (Tr. 159)  Since her last traffic-related offense, in
2018, Applicant has never let her insurance  lapse. (Tr. 109-110)
Between 2016 and February, Applicant and her ex-boyfriend cohabited. (GE 12;
Tr.  98-99,  114-115)  While  their  financial  living  arrangements  were  based  on  cost-
sharing,  her  boyfriend  often  failed  to  cover  his  share  of  the  bills  (including  her  car
insurance)  that  he  promised  to  take  care  of.  (Tr.  100-102,109-112)  Without  financial
assistance from her boyfriend, Applicant turned to working night shifts on other jobs to
make more money. (Tr. 105) From the outset, their relationship included periodic heated
arguments (to include screaming and yelling) and generally abusive treatment of her by
her  boyfriend.  (Tr.  111-114)  To  improve  their  relationship,  they  attended  couples
counselling  in  2019,  albeit  without  any  tangible  success.  (Tr.116,  151)  Applicant
struggled  with  mood  swings  during  this  time  frame.  To  address  her  emotional  issues,
Applicant  briefly  consulted  a  therapist  during  the  same  period  to  address  her  bi-polar
condition. (Tr. 151-152)
By  February  2020,  Applicant’s  co-habitation  relationship  with  her  ex-boyfriend
had  deteriorated  to  the  breaking  point.  Looking  for  emotional  relief,  she  temporarily
moved home to her mother’s place before finding her own apartment. (Tr. 34, 114-115)
To  this point,  Applicant  had  not  encountered  any  domestic  violence  incidents  with  her
boyfriend.  Police  reports  did  not  uncover  any  unreported  domestic  violence  incidents
involving Applicant and her ex-boyfriend. GE 12; Tr. 129)
In  October  2020,  Applicant  and  her  boyfriend  attended  a  wedding  reception  for
his  sister.  (GE  12;  Tr.  116-117)  Because  he  had  become  intoxicated  while  she  was
sober,  she  drove  him  to  her  place  to  spend  the  evening.  (GE  12,  Tr.  117-126,  148)
Once they returned to her apartment, Applicant’s boyfriend initially positioned himself on
the  couch.  (GE  12) After repairing  to  her bedroom  at Applicant’s  request,  he  emerged
from the bedroom to mount an argument with Applicant over her not joining him in the
bed.  (GE  12)  Arguments  ensued  between  the  pair  and  quickly  escalated  into  heated
verbal  exchanges  before
turning  physical.  (GE  12;  Tr.  148-149)  Applicant’s
acknowledged loud yelling prompted some unknown person to call the police. (Tr. 119)
Police  accounts  confirm  arguments  between  Applicant  and  her  boyfriend  over
their  sleeping  arrangements.  (GE  12)  The  investigating  officer  recited  pushing  and
shoving between the parties and Applicant’s clawing her boyfriend’s face after he struck
her in the face. (GE 12) Photos were taken of both parties, and the investigating officer
reported several lacerations on her boyfriend’s face. (GE 12)
Asked  to  provide  a  complete  a  portion  of  the  domestic  violence  supplement
diagram, Applicant declined. (GE 12) While her boyfriend  provided some details of his
2020 encounter with Applicant, he, too, refused to provide a written statement. (GE 12)
Based  on  the  investigating  officer’s  findings,  police  filed  domestic  violence  charges
against Applicant and closed the case. (GE 12).
Court records document criminal charges filed against Applicant in October 2020
for assault-second degree (a misdemeanor). (GEs 1, 12 and AE D) The case was nolle
prossed in March 2021 without any assigned reasons. Neither police arrest reports nor
court  records  reveal  any  changed  or  supplemental  accounts  provided  by  Applicant
concerning the October 2020 domestic violence incident.  (AE D; Tr. 161-163) Whether
Applicant’s boyfriend  declined  to  support  the  charges going  forward is unclear  as  well.
Surprised  initially  of  criminal  charges  being  filed  against  her,  Applicant  first  learned  of
the  police  charges  from  her  manager  who  she  had  contemporaneously  disclosed  the
incident  to  in  October  2020.  (Tr.  133-134)  Applicant  herself  has  no  history  of  ever
assaulting anyone. (Tr. 129)
Photos of Applicant taken at the scene of the October 2020 incident reveal deep
bruises to her arms and face. (AE E; Tr. 120-121) Applicant attributed the bruises to her
boyfriend’s  aggressive  attacks  to  her  face  and  arms.  (Tr.  122-125)  She  attributed  the
deep scratches to his face to her efforts to repel his choking her with his hand over her
mouth.  (Tr.  122-126)  Asked  at  hearing  why  she  withheld  her  current  accounts  of  her
boyfriend’s aggressive  actions when  questioned by investigating police, she expressed
concerns about (a) his being on probation at the time and at risk of being sent to jail for
any future arrests and charges and (b) his blaming her for any charges filed against him
and taking retaliatory measures against her. (Tr. 120,125-128, 148-149) She terminated
her  relationship  with  her  boyfriend  the  day  of  the  incident  and  has  taken  no  initiatives
since the 2020 incident to resume one with him. (Tr. 122, 126-127, and 131) In none of
her previous relationships was she ever assaulted by any of her boyfriends. (Tr. 169)
Since  the  October 2020  incident,  Applicant  has taken  concerted  steps to  address
her emotional issues and  to  ensure she  never misses  court  notices  again.  (Tr. 87,  135-
136)  She   has  a   coach   to   help  her  with   her  decision-making   and   is  looking   for  a
counselor to  help  her with  her emotional-stress issues. (Tr.  136) She  believes she  has
matured  and  is better able  to  manage  her personal affairs.  (Tr.  139)  She  has  a  pending
petition  to  expunge  the  domestic violence  charge  against  her.  (AE  D; Tr. 160-161)   No
further details are available on the status of her petition. (Tr. 160)
Endorsements and certificates of training and achievement
Applicant  is  well-regarded  by  her  project  managers,  coworkers,  Navy  and  DoD
contractor  customers,  parents,  friends,  and  managers  and  coworkers  of  former
restaurant  employers.  (AE  A; Tr.  23-25,  171)  All  credit  her  with  good  moral  character,
strong work ethic,  honesty,  reliability,  and  professional  integrity.  Except for her mother
who testified on her behalf, none of her character references expressed any knowledge
of the Government’s security concerns. (AE A; Tr. 24-25, 169-176)
Testifying  in her daughter’s behalf, Applicant’s mother  and close friend provided
important  details  about  Applicant’s  mental  health  condition.  She  recited  that  in  the
Spring of 2003, Applicant was medically diagnosed to have a bi-polar condition with an
attention  deficit  disorder  (ADD)  sub-diagnosis.  (Tr.  24-25,  46-47)  Since  the  October
2020 incident, Applicant has retained a life coach (in January 2021) to help her with her
coping  issues  while  she  and  her  mother  look  for  a  mental  health  provider  to  evaluate
and treat her ADD and bi-polar conditions.
Corroborated  by  Applicant’s  mother  and  close  personal  friend  (a  senior  IT
projects  manager)  were  the  stressors  Applicant  experienced  from  her  abusive
relationship  with  her  ex-boyfriend.  (Tr.  39-49)  These  stressors  exacerbated  her  ADD
and bipolar conditions and contributed to the erratic behavior displayed by Applicant in
her  cited 2007-2018 traffic-related incidents.  (Tr. 39-49) With  the  coaching  help  she  is
currently  receiving,  her  mother  was  optimistic  of  Applicant’s  ability  to  succeed  in  a
structured environment at work, free of the stresses she encountered in her relationship
with her ex-boyfriend. (Tr. 25, 33, 171-172)
Documented  performance  evaluations  for  calendar  years  2019  and  2020  credit
Applicant  with  successfully  meeting  expectations.  (AE  B;  Tr.  172-173)  The  evaluations
credit  her  with  continued  growth,  and  acceptance  of  greater  responsibility.They
underscore her positive pursuit of training and her gains in proficiency in a number of her
employer’s technical processes. (AEs B-C; Tr. 73-75)
