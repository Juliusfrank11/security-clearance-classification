Applicant  is  a  37-year-old  configuration  management  specialist  for  a  defense
contractor  who  seeks  a  security  clearance.  The  admitted  allegations  are  incorporated
and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant  has  never  married  or  entered  into  a  legally  recognized  domestic
partnership and has no children. (GEs 1-2 and 4) She earned a high school diploma in
May 2001 and a bachelor’s degree in May 2005. (GEs 1-2 and AE K) She reported no
military service.
Since  May  2019,  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  her  current  defense
contractor.  (Item  3)  Previously,  she  worked  for  other  defense  contractors  in  various
jobs. (GEs 1-2 and 4 and AE K) She reported unemployment between March 2019 and
May 2019 following her termination for a cited positive drug test in March 2019. (GES 1
and  5)  Other  reported  periods  of  unemployment  by  Applicant  occurred  between
February 2005 and May 2005 and between August 2001 and October 2001. She held a
security clearance between November 2012 and March 2019. (GEs 1 and 5; Tr. 69-70)
Applicant’s drug history
On  a  Sunday  afternoon  In  March  2019,  Applicant  spent  the  afternoon  at  her
home with a male friend venting about events that were causing her emotional grief and
distress:  a  recent  breakup  with  her  boyfriend  and  a  large  water  break  at  her  new
townhouse residence that caused major damage and substantial repair costs. (GE 4; Tr.
31-32,  72-74,  76-77)  This friend  was  not  a  coworker  but  a  contractor  at  her  work  site
who would infrequently interact with her contractor friend over a three-month period. (Tr.
72)
Feeling drained and without much energy, she turned to her contractor friend for
emotional support and assistance in painting her damaged townhouse. (Tr. 33-34, 73)
This friend  offered her cocaine  to  relieve  her stress.  (GE  4; Tr.,  at 72-73)  At  the  time,
Applicant was aware that her contractor friend was a cocaine user. (Tr. 34, 74) Shocked
to see this friend produce two lines of cocaine in her presence, she accepted the lines
offered  her  by  her  friend  and  felt  immediate  remorse.  (GE  4;  Tr.  34,  74-75)  Both
Applicant and her friend were sober in their moment of shared cocaine use. (Tr. 73-76)
With  a  security  clearance  she  possessed  since  2012,  Applicant  was  intimately
familiar with the anti-drug policies in place with her employer and the DoD and the likely
loss of both her job and security clearance in the event of a positive drug test. (GE 4; Tr.
69-71)  Before  accepting  cocaine  from  her  friend  in  March  2019,  Applicant  had  never
used any illegal drugs while holding a security clearance  that was first issued in 2012.
(Tr. 36, 75)
Waking up the next morning (a Monday in March 2019), and feeling the effects of
her  cocaine  use  the  previous  day,  Applicant  went  to  work.  (Tr.  34-35,  72)  With  an
opportunity to self-report her cocaine use incident to her facility clearance officer (FSO)
when  she  arrived  at  work  that  day,  she  declined  to  do  so,  citing  concerns  about  her
security  clearance  and  employer’s  termination  policy  covering  illegal  drug  use.  (GE  4;
Tr.  35-36,  70-71,  77-78)  Applicant  acknowledged  her  employer’s  self-reporting
requirement and expressed regret for not self-reporting the incident to her  FSO before
being referred to drug testing. (Tr. 70-71)
Fearing the moment of accountability with her employer, Applicant waivered over
self-reporting her cocaine  use to her  supervisor or  (FSO) and  ultimately demurred.  By
failing to promptly self-report her cocaine use  with the first opportunity available to  her
when  she  reported  for  work  on  the  Monday  following  her  acceptance  of  cocaine,  she
missed a sizable opportunity to openly account for her judgment lapse and reinforce her
understanding  and  appreciation  of  her  employer’s  anti-drug  policy.  Failing  to  promptly
self-report  her  cocaine  use  incident,  she  opened  herself  to  candor  and  credibility
challenges about her access to and use of illegal drugs in general.
While  offloading  a  flatbed  at  work  the  following  Tuesday  (in  March  2021),
Applicant chose the wrong forklift for unloading, and her load fell off the forklift. (GE 4;
Tr.  35,  77)  Applicant  promptly  reported  her  forklift  accident  to  her  supervisor  knowing
she  would  be  referred  for  drug  testing  in  accordance  with  her  employer’s  accident
protocols. (GE 4; Tr. 35-36, 70-71)
Once  Applicant  reported  her  forklift  accident,  her  supervisor  referred  her  to  the
expected  drug  testing  Applicant  anticipated.  Once  faced  with  an  involuntary drug  test,
Applicant  volunteered  to  the  testing  official  prior  to  submitting  to  a  drug  test  that  she
could  be  at  risk  to  a  positive  test  result  due  to  the  cocaine  she  ingested  the  previous
Sunday (less than 48 hours earlier). (Tr. 70-71)
Returned  test  results  were  positive  for  cocaine  ingestion.  Applicant,  while
embarrassed and ashamed, did not challenge the test results and was terminated from
her employment the following Tuesday of March 2019. (GE 4; GE 4; Tr. 36-37, 78-79)
Although  she  did  not  lose  her  security  clearance  with  her  job  termination,  she  is  not
eligible for rehire. (Tr. 78) And, as a result, she was able to obtain new employment with
her current employer. (GEs 1 and 4; Tr. 79)
In  the  security  clearance  application  Applicant  completed  in  October  2019,  she
acknowledged her not being compliant with her employer’s drug policy as the basis for
her separation from the company without admitting her March 2019 cocaine use. When
asked  about  her  prior  drug  use  in  a  separate  section  of  the  application  covering  drug
use within the previous seven years, she acknowledged her cocaine use in 2019. (GE
1)
Before her positive drug test in March 2019, Applicant had never been subjected
to  random  drug  testing;  although  her  employer  at  the  time  did  have  a  random  testing
program.  (Tr. 68-70,  74-75) Since  her positive  drug  test  in  March 2019,  Applicant  has
twice  been  tested  for  illegal  drugs,  once  in  November  2020  to  satisfy  state  medical
requirements  for  prescribed  Adderall  and  again  in  January  2021  on  the  suggestion  of
her  attorney.  (AEs  F  and  L;  Tr.  37-39)  Non-randomized  test  results  were  negative  for
illegal substances in her system. (AEs F and L)
In November 2020, Applicant assured under oath that she would abstain from all
future  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse  and  specifically  avoid  any  use  of
cocaine or any other illegal drug in the future, and immediately report any future use of
an illegal drug to her security officer. She acknowledged her understanding that should
she violate her statement of intent, her security clearance  and accesses will be denied
or revoked. (AE A)
For the past 27 months, Applicant credibly assured that she has avoided cocaine
and any other illegal drugs and disassociated from the friend who provided the cocaine
to her in March 2019. (Tr. 48-52) Her assurances are accepted.
Applicant’s history of  alcohol-related incidents
Besides Applicant’s reported 2019 cocaine use incident, she was involved in two
separate  alcohol-related  incidents.  The  first  such  incident  occurred  in  July  2007  when
she was arrested and charged with DUI. (GEs 2 and 4) Stressed by the passing of her
maternal grandmother,  Applicant consumed  too  much  alcohol while  at a  friend’s home
for  a  barbeque.  (GE  4;  Tr.  39-40)  While  driving  home  from  the  barbeque,  she  was
stopped  by a  police officer and  arrested  and charged  with  DUI.  (GEs  2  and  4; Tr. 40)
Embarrassed  by  the  incident,  she  pre-enrolled  in  an  alcohol  and  substance  abuse
program. (GE 4; Tr. 40)
Appearing in court to answer the pending DUI charges stemming from her 2007
DUI  incident,  Applicant  pled  guilty  and  was  sentenced  to  probation  before  judgment.
Probation  conditions  included  community  service  completion  of  her  already-enrolled
substance abuse program. Applicant is credited with successfully  completing all of  the
requirements  of  her  substance  abuse  program  and  satisfying  the  court’s  imposed
probation conditions. (GEs 2 and 4 and AE G; Tr. 40)
While  her  2008  security  clearance  application  was  still  pending,  Applicant  was
involved in a second alcohol-related incident. Returning home in March 2012 from a St.
Patrick’s  Day  celebration  with  friends,  where  she  consumed  multiple  drinks  before
departing the tavern in the early morning hours, Applicant was stopped by a state police
officer and arrested and charged with DUI. (GEs 1 and 3-4; Tr. 41-42, 60-61) At the time
she was stopped and arrested in March 2012, Applicant held a security clearance. (GEs
1 and 4-5; Tr. 42-43) Breathalyzer test results administered to Applicant by the arresting
officer confirmed a blood-alcohol content (BAC) of .16%. (GE 4; Tr. 61) Applicant self-
reported this incident to her FSO. (Tr. 42)
Before making her court appearance to address her 2012 DUI charges, Applicant
enrolled  in  an  outpatient  alcoholic  substance  abuse  program  that  did  not  include  a
diagnosis or abstinence  recommendation.  (GE  4; Tr. 42, 61-62) When  she did  appear
for her scheduled August 2012 court hearing, she pled guilty to the charges in court and
was  sentenced  to  15  days  in  jail  followed  by  two  years  of  supervised  probation  that
included an ordered interlock installed on her vehicle. Her imposed sentence included a
fine of $2,889 (inclusive of court costs). (GEs 3-4; Tr. 43-44)
Applicant served 13 days of her imposed 2012 sentence before her early release
for  good  behavior  and  made  monthly  payments  of  $112  to  repay  her  court-ordered
fines. (GEs 3-4; Tr. 44-45) She completed her alcoholic substance abuse program after
attending regular classes between April 2012 and October 2012. (GE 4)
In October 2012, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of
Personnel  management  (OPM)  in  October  2012.  In  this  personal  subject  interview
(PSI), Applicant disclosed her alcohol history to the investigator. (GE 4) Covered in her
PSI  were  the  facts  surrounding  her  two  DUI  arrests,  court  dispositions,  and  her
counseling sessions. (GE 4)
Between  2001  and  2012,  Applicant  typically  consumed  alcohol  in  social
situations with friends and  acknowledged her drinking to the point of intoxication three
to seven times a year in social events. (GE 4)  Since her 2012 DUI offense, Applicant
never consumes alcohol to excess and  confines her drinking to social settings.  (GE 4;
Tr. 65-66) Based on the information and data compiled by OPM investigators  in 2012,
Applicant was granted a security clearance. (GEs 3 and 4; Tr., 69-71,102)
Endorsements and certificates of training and achievement
Applicant  is  well-regarded  by  her  supervisors,  colleagues,  customers,  and
friends.  (AEs  B-E  and  H)  All  credit  her  with  good  character,  self-discipline,
professionalism,  and  a  disposition  for  adhering  to  rules  and  regulations  at  work  while
providing  daily  support  for  her  sister  (a  single  mother)  and  her  parents.  While
acknowledging their awareness of her drug and alcohol issues, two of her close friends
expressed  confidence in  her ability to avoid  irresponsible  drinking and future lapses  in
judgment that produced her isolated incident of cocaine use in 2019. (AE B-C)
Other  friends  of  Applicant  who  hold  positions  of  trust  expressed  strong  support
for  Applicant’s  maintaining  her  security  clearance  eligibility.  One  hearing  witness  is  a
lifetime friend of Applicant with knowledge of her two past DUIs and 2019 cocaine use
incident.  This  witness  credited  Applicant  with  exemplary  dedication  to  her  work  and
family  and  expressed  confidence  in  Applicant’s  ability  to  maintain  a  healthy  regimen
without any alcohol excess or use of illegal substances. (Tr. 84-88)
Another  friend  and  neighbor  of  Applicant’s,  with  daily  contact  over  the  past  two
plus years, is a federal court commissioner with over 25 years of experience. (Tr. 98-99)
With  knowledge  of  Applicant’s  two  DUIs  and  2019  cocaine  use  incident,  she,  too,
expressed  total  confidence  in  Applicant’s  ability  to  maintain  responsible  drinking  habits
and keep her promises not to use or engage in any activities involving illegal drugs. (Tr.
98-100)
These hearing accounts represent strong character endorsements from individuals
in  trust  positions  and  are  entitled  to  considerable  weight  in  making  whole-person
character  assessments  of  Applicant.  Not  provided  by  Applicant  were  potentially  helpful
accounts  of  direct  supervisors  and  coworkers  who  have  worked  closely  with  her  at  her
current  and  previous  places  of  employment.  Performance  evaluations  from  her  current
employer were not included in her exhibit submissions.
Over  the  past  two  years,  Applicant  has  completed  courses  in  classification  and
annual ethics training. (AE H) With her educational background and experience, she has
received  offers  of  employment  from  defense  contractors  looking  for  configuration
management  specialists.  (AE  I)  Her  performance  and  contributions  to  her  current
employer earned her a year-end bonus of $2,200 for 2020. (AE M) Her employer credited
her with being one of a select group of employees to receive a salary bonus for calendar
year 2020. (AE M)
