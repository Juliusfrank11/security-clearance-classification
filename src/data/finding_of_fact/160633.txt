Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  45  years old.  He  earned  bachelor’s  degrees  in  2001 and  2003.  He
never  married  and  has  no  children.  Applicant  was  unemployed  for  four  months  from
October  2007  to  January  2008.  Because  of  his  unemployment,  he  filed  Chapter  13
bankruptcy in 2009, and his debts were discharged in May 2014. He has been steadily
employed since 2008 and has worked for his current employer since 2018.  (Transcript
(Tr.) 16-23, 38-41; GE 1, 3)
Applicant earned approximately $45,000 in 2008 and his annual salary increased
steadily to approximately $80,000 in 2016. He moved to a new state in 2016 to take a
better paying job. His salary increased to approximately $88,000 and is now $90,000. He
obtained two loans and three credit cards to put a down payment on a house at his new
location  and  for  moving  expenses.  He  repaid  the  loans.  Applicant  underestimated  the
costs associated with his new home. He realized he was overextended. (Tr. 19-20, 24,
32-33, 51-54)
From  2014  to  2016,  Applicant  lived  in  his  family  home  that  he  and  his  sister
inherited. There was an existing mortgage on the property of about $40,000 to $50,000.
In  2016,  Applicant  refinanced  the  property  and  received  about  $50,000  to  $60,000  in
equity from the house. He spent $16,000 to satisfy his sister’s tax debt. He used most of
the remaining money to remodel the house while he was living there. When he refinanced
the house it was put in his name only. When he moved, he kept the house and used it on
weekends. In about the middle of 2018, he began to rent the house. He rented to friends
and the monthly rental fee did not cover the mortgage and other expenses associated
with the house. He exhausted most of the money he had received from refinancing the
house. Applicant stated he could barely afford his expenses. He then spent about $5,000
on the house after the tenants moved because they did not maintain the house properly
and to prepare it for sale. The house is now on the market for sale. (Tr. 30, 34-35, 41-51)
In 2017, Applicant was involved in four car accidents. He testified that they all were
his fault. Two of the accidents involved rental vehicles. In the first accident, he totaled his
car,  and  the  insurance  paid  all  but  a  $1,000  deductible.  He  purchased  a  new  car
(approximately $45,000). At the same time, he decided to purchase a second vehicle, a
used 2013 Cadillac for approximately $32,000, because he always wanted this model of
car.  He  then   had   another  accident  with   his  new   car  and   was  responsible   for  the
deductible, which was higher because of his last accident. He kept the Cadillac  until July
2018,  and  then  surrendered  it to  the  creditor when  he  no  longer could  make  the  payments.
SOR  ¶  1.c  ($20,706)   reflects  the   deficiency   amount   owed   after  the   vehicle   was  sold.
Applicant has not  contacted  the  creditor  or taken  any  action  to  resolve  this debt.  He  stated
that after he  purchased  the  second  vehicle  his finances became  out of  control.  (Tr. 24-
26, 54-60, 62)
Applicant testified that in about January or February 2018, he enrolled his debts
with a debt consolidation company (DCC) that advised him to stop paying his credit card
bills, and it would negotiate settlements on his behalf. It could not include the debt in SOR
¶ 1.c because it did not qualify. He followed the advice and made payments to DCC. He
was to pay DCC $320 a month. He said he made payments of $600 a month, but could
not recall how many. He estimated it was less than a year, but more than six months. He
did not provide documents to show his payments. He stopped making payments to DCC
when  his  wages  were  garnished  due  to  the  judgment  and  garnishment  for  the  debt  in
SOR ¶ 1.b. Applicant testified that he self-reported his financial problems to his employer.
(Tr. 26-30, 62-69)
In October 2018, a judgment was entered against Applicant (SOR ¶ 1.b - $9,946).
Applicant’s  wages  were  garnished.  The  judgment  was  satisfied  and  released  in  June
2020. Applicant testified that the garnishment impacted his ability to pay his other debts.
(Tr. 26, 36-38, 61-62; GE 6, AE A)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($8,014) was a personal loan that was charged off and later
settled by DCC for less than the full amount. Applicant could not recall the amount of the
settlement. It is reflected on his credit report and is resolved. (Tr. 70-72; GE 7; AE B)
Applicant admitted he owes the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e ($7,629), 1.g ($1,132), 1.h
($675), 1.i ($547), and 1.j (past due - $3,667). He indicated the debts were enrolled with
DCC, but he has not made progress on resolving them. (Tr. 72-79)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.f ($1,671) is reflected in Applicant’s April 2018 credit report
as a charged-off account in collection. Applicant testified that the debt was past due and
he paid it, and the account closed. He provided a July 2021 credit report that reflected
such. The account is not listed on his January 2021 credit report. This debt is resolved.
(Tr. 72-76; GE 7, GE 9; AE B).
Applicant testified that his finances were also impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic
because his sister lost her job in March 2020, and he provided her $1,000 a month until
February 2021. Applicant has no money in savings. He is paying the mortgages on two
homes, along with the expenses associated with them. He said that he has cut back on
his lifestyle in an attempt to reduce his living expenses. He intends to address his debts
in the short-term by saving and paying his creditors and in the long-term by selling his
family home. (Tr. 20, 28-29, 34-36, 80-83)
