Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She is applying for a
position of  trust for the first  time. She  is a  high  school graduate,  and attended  college
between  1993  and  1997,  earning  her  bachelor’s  degree.  She  has  been  in  a  civil
marriage since January 2009. She has one child, age 10, and two stepchildren, ages 25
and 26. (Item 2)
Applicant’s  work  history  indicates  she  worked  for  a  private  company  as  a
software  developer between  1998  and  2019.  In  addition,  she had a  part-time  job  as  a
Mary  Kay  Beauty  Consultant.  She  was  hired  by  her  current  employer  and  sensitive
position  sponsor,  a  federal  contractor,  in  November  2019.  She  submitted  her  first
application to hold a sensitive position in December 2019.
The SOR alleges eight delinquent medical accounts in collection totaling $5,913
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.f, 1.i, and 1.k); a 2014 charged-off loan for $252 (SOR ¶ 1.g); a 2012 -
2013  charged-off  auto  loan  for  $18,198  (SOR  ¶  1.h);  and  a  2015  collection  by  a
communications provider for $174 (SOR ¶ 1.j).
Applicant  admitted the SOR  allegations. In her SOR  response, Applicant  stated
that the medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a was originally for about $2,448, and she paid
$1,489  in  2020.  In  June  2020,  her  state  intercepted  her  state  income  tax  refund  for
$1,618,  and  applied  it  to  the  medical  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.  The  total  owed  was
reduced  to  $958.  (See,  Applicant’s  FORM  Response)  Concerning  the  medical  debts
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b - 1.d, Applicant stated she accrued the debts as a result of neck
surgery around 2018-2019. She promised to aggregate the three debts into a payment
plan to be paid in 2022.
Applicant initially claimed she paid the $152 medical debt alleged in  SOR ¶ 1.e.
Later she indicated she had scheduled payments and promised the debt would be paid
by  March  2021.  She  presented  no  documentary  evidence  to  corroborate  her  claims.
Applicant claimed that she had scheduled payments for all of the remaining SOR debts,
and  promised  to  pay  them  in  2021.  She  presented  no  documentary  evidence  to
corroborate  her  claims.  The  SOR  debs  are  listed  on  a  January  2020  credit  report,  a
September 2020 credit report, or both credit reports. (Items 4, 5)
The  $18,198  charged-off  auto  loan  (SOR  ¶  1.h)  is  a  joint  account.  Applicant
asserted  that  she  cosigned  the  loan  for  her  husband.  Later,  he  changed  jobs  with  a
resulting  loss  of  $400  income,  and  they  could  not  afford  to  pay  the  loan.  The  dealer
refused  to  modify  the  auto  loan  and  they  returned  the  car  to  the  lender.  There  is  no
evidence of payments on this account.
Applicant  submitted  documentary  evidence  showing  that  she  established  a
payment agreement and paid a $252 medical debt to a collection agency (SOR ¶ 1.h).
She paid $50 in February 2020, and made three $50 payments and one of $52 in 2021.
She presented receipts for three payments of $50 made toward the $498 debt alleged in
SOR ¶ 1.f. Additionally, she made $50 payments in February and April 2021 towards a
$1,352 debt that apparently was not alleged in the SOR.
In her answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed the following debts were scheduled
to  be  paid  in  February-March  2021:  SOR  ¶¶  1.e,  1.j,  and  1.k.  She  presented  no
documentary evidence to corroborate her claims. She noted that the following debts had
not  been  addressed  as  of  her  SOR  answer:  SOR  ¶¶  1.h  and  1.i.  Except  as  noted
previously, there is no evidence of payments toward the remaining SOR debts.
Applicant attributed her financial problems to not making sufficient money to pay
her  living  expenses  and  debts;  her  husband’s  failure  to  provide  her  with  financial
less  money;  and  his  periods  of
assistance;  his  changing
underemployment and low-paying jobs. The record also shows she apparently provided
financial  assistance  to  her  mother,  and  had  medical  problems  associated  with  a  neck
operation.
jobs  and  making
Applicant  did  not  present  evidence  of  her  current  financial  situation  (gross
monthly  income,  deductions,  monthly  expenses,  and  monthly  net  remainder).  She  did
not present evidence to show that she has a working budget. There is no evidence to
show she has had recent financial counseling or has a working budget.
