The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of November 9, 2020, Applicant owed
delinquent debts totaling $52,529 on 12 accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.l). When he responded to
the SOR allegations, Applicant stated:
For all  of  the  above  I admit to  being  delinquent.  A  bankruptcy  lawyer was
hired   approx.  1.5   years ago   [and]  was given  a  down  payment but did no
work.  I had no means (money) to continue to pursue.
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact:
Applicant is a 40-year-old engineering technician. Married since December 2011, he
and his spouse have no children. Applicant served honorably on active duty in the U.S.
military from June 1999 to December 2014.  He held a DOD security clearance for the
duration of his military service, and in August 2008, he was determined eligible for access
to sensitive compartmented information (SCI). (GE 1.) He was separated from the military
in December 2014 for failing to maintain physical fitness standards. (GE 4; Tr. 23-24.) He
had  struggled  to  meet  height  and  weight  standards  and  “finally  [he]  just  couldn’t  do  it
anymore.” (Tr. 24.)
After his military discharge, Applicant began working as a quality inspector for a
local company almost immediately for some income while seeking better employment. He
and his spouse began to fall behind in their payments on some debts. (GEs 1, 3.) In April
2015, Applicant left that job to work for his current employer, a defense contractor. He was
granted a DOD secret clearance in February 2016. (GEs 1-2.) He has been assigned to his
current contract since March 2017. (GE 1.) As a condition of his employer’s contract with
the  U.S. military, Applicant’s job requires him to hold a security clearance, although he
does  not  handle  classified  information  with  any regularity.  He  testified  that  he  has  not
handled any classified documents in several years, but he needs a clearance for base
access. (Tr. 23.)
In   August  2019,  the   DOD  Continuous  Evaluation   Program   (DCEP)  developed
unreported  information  from  checking  Applicant’s credit report. Trans Union  reported  on
May  16, 2019, that Applicant owed  $45,693  in delinquent  debts on  ten accounts.  (GE 2.)
On  March  17,  2020,  Applicant  completed  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security
Positions (SF 86). In response to inquiries concerning any delinquency involving routine
accounts in the last seven years, Applicant reported only one past-due debt, but he also
explained that after he separated from the military “unexpectedly,” he and his spouse got
behind on their bills. (GE 1.) On his SF 86, Applicant  indicated that a bank credit-card
account had been charged off for approximately $6,000 in December 2019, and that he
has been sued for the debt. He stated that his spouse has been in contact with the creditor
bank to set up a payment plan. (GE 1.)
A  check  of  Applicant’s  credit  on  April  25,  2020,  revealed  a  record  of  extensive
reliance on consumer credit over the years. While Applicant had paid on some accounts
according to their terms, 12 accounts had been charged off or placed for collection or both.
The salient details of the debts are set forth in the following table.

3.) Applicant believes it is for
unpaid property tax. (Tr. 29.)
As of November 2019, Applicant was 30 days late in his $232 monthly car payment
on a loan obtained in February 2017 for $12,373. His spouse was making timely payments
of $357 per month on an automobile lease obtained in February 2018 for $12,089. (GE 3.)
On May 19, 2020, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He explained that his financial situation began to
decline when he was deployed in 2013, and his spouse depleted their savings of about
$10,000  by purchasing kitchen  appliances,  a  washer and  dryer, and  an  entertainment
center. (GE 4: Tr. 24-25.) On his separation from the military, he cashed out his Thrift
Savings Plan (TSP) and used the $5,000 received to pay bills and living expenses. His
spouse was unemployed at the time. His first job after his discharge paid him only $30,000
to $35,000 annually, which was a significant loss of income from his annual pay of $80,000
in the military. He started with his current employer in April 2015 at $46,000 annually. He
and his spouse resorted to credit cards to purchase groceries and clothing, and to pay bills.
By the time his spouse found a job as an administrative assistant at an annual salary of
approximately $24,000 in 2016, they were struggling to pay their credit-card balances. (GE
4.) Applicant did not consider taking over handling his household finances. (Tr. 25.)
In  2017,  Applicant’s  pay  increased  to  $53,000  annually,  and  with  his  spouse’s
income, it brought their household income to $77,000 annually, but their debt continued to
mount.  Applicant  was  distracted  after  the  death  of  his  mother  in  2017.  He  told  the
investigator that he knew at the time that they had credit-card debt, but he did not realize
the severity of their debt. (GE 4.) At his hearing, he admitted that his spouse had shown
him notices that they received in the mail; that he was aware what was happening but that
there was nothing he could do. (Tr. 26.)
When confronted by the investigator about the various accounts on his credit record,
Applicant expressed surprise to learn that he owed about $45,000 to $50,000 in collection
debts, but he did not dispute the debts after speaking with his spouse, who manages their
joint  finances.  He  indicated  that  the  credit-card  debts  were  joint  accounts.  (GE  4.)
However, the credit cards are reported on his credit record as individual accounts. (GE 3.)
He explained at his hearing that his spouse used his information and opened the accounts,
albeit with his knowledge. (Tr. 35-36.) Applicant told the OPM investigator that he was
embarrassed about his financial situation, and that he did not pay close attention to his
household’s finances. However, he also admitted that he knew that there were times in
2019 when  he and his spouse had to wait for a paycheck before they could buy food.
Applicant stated that he had not received financial counseling but he had contacted an
attorney  about  possibly  filing  for  bankruptcy.  He  had  not  considered  using  a  financial
agency  to  help  manage  his  debts  because  he  believes  there  is  a  lot  of  fraud  in  that
industry. As for his plans going forward, Applicant reportedly stated:
The  $50,000  plus debt is a  lot. I hope  the  bankruptcy  works out.  If  not I’ll
have  to  reevaluate  my  situation. A  fresh  financial start will be  good  for  us.  My
wife   got  a   new   job   in  10/2019.  She   now   brings  home   close   to   the   same
amount of  money  I make. I am  certain we  make  enough  money  now  to  pay
our day  to  day  bills and  living  expenses. I don’t think we  have  the  finances to
keep  up  with  our bills with  this sort of  debt,  but I’m  certain we  will work it out.
Applicant added  that he  and  his spouse  were living  from  paycheck to  paycheck,  but
they  have  reduced  their  restaurant dining, and  their  situation  should improve  now  that his
spouse  was earning  about $2,500  a  month. He stated, and  his April 2020  credit report  (GE
3) shows, that he  and  his spouse  were no  longer using  credit to  pay  living  expenses. (GE
4.)
Applicant’s spouse started a new job in March 2020. She has since received two
promotions, although has not yet received the pay increase from her latest promotion to
account manager. He and his spouse estimate that they would have to pay $800 a month
under a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan, which they cannot afford before his spouse receives
the  increase in her income. (Tr. 16-18.) Applicant was unable to provide any specifics
about their household finances, including about his spouse’s income. She continues to
handle  their  finances.  (Tr.  20.)  He  clarified  at  his  hearing  that  he  never  talked  to  the
bankruptcy attorney, although  his spouse  “said  she  did.” (Tr. 20-21.) Applicant has not
contacted any of the collection entities holding his debts to determine whether they would
be willing to settle for less than full balances. (Tr. 21, 26.) He testified that it did not cross
his mind, but also that he did not think that his creditors would work with him. (Tr. 27.)
Applicant and his spouse moved to their current residence in February 2020. (GE 1.)
They pay rent of almost $1,000 per month (Tr. 30-31.) The rent at their previous residence,
where they lived for 14 years, went from $825 to $850 per month. (Tr. 31.) Applicant and
his spouse did not have any savings for several years. In the last year, they have managed
to  save  approximately $2,000.  (Tr. 32.) Applicant  earned  $22  an  hour  with  his current
employer from April 2015 to March 2017. His hourly wage has been $27 since March 2017.
(Tr. 34-35.) Applicant’s supervisor told him that their employer has financial management
information available, but Applicant “didn’t do anything with it.” (Tr. 36.) He cannot pay his
debts so he did not think the information would be helpful to him. (Tr. 37.)
