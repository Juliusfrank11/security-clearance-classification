Applicant  is  a  59-year-old  HVAC  Supervisor,  employed  by  a  government
contractor  since  May  2017.  He  is  a  high  school  graduate,  and  was  previously  self-
employed  as  an  HVAC  technician  from  1998  to  2017.  He  is  unmarried  and  has  two
children.
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to file Federal income tax
returns for tax years 2010, and 2015-2018, as required. (SOR ¶ 1.a) It also alleges that
Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent Federal taxes from tax
year 2010, for $26,000. (SOR ¶ 1.b) Applicant admitted the allegations with explanations.
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he borrowed money in 2010 to buy
a  house  as  an  investment.  Although  he  did  not  miss  any  mortgage  payments,  he
eventually  sold  another  home  and  moved  into  the  investment  house  in  order  to  make
ends meet. He was financially overextended as he said he lost money on the investment
due to market conditions at the time, and did not have funds to pay Federal income taxes.
In addition, his brother’s mother-in-law was his tax preparer until she retired in 2015. He
did not follow up with the new preparer, and fell behind on filing his Federal income tax
returns. Instead, he  said that he focused on the dissolution of  his relationship with the
mother  of  his  children,  and  rebuilding  his  business.  He  became  a  single  father  of  his
teenaged children in April 2017.
Applicant also stated that he paid down his $26,000 tax debt from tax year 2010,
and  now  owes  approximately  $18,000.  He  referenced  an  IRS  notice  from  September
2020 that he submitted with his Answer, however the IRS letter is a notification that his
overpayment of 2019 taxes was applied toward his tax year 2009 tax debt, not his 2010
debt, and that he owes $18,090 for 2009. Applicant may have confused the tax year in
which he is delinquent.
In response to Government interrogatories from April 2020, Applicant noted that
he had not filed his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2010, 2015, and 2018, but
that he was going to file them “ASAP.” He also claimed that his accountant was working
on  his  tax  returns  for  2016  and  2017.  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  provided
receipts for certified mailings to the IRS, with handwritten notations of his name with “2010
1040”; “2015 1040”; and “2016.” He also provided an “electronic filing client status history”
apparently showing a tax return electronically filed with the IRS in May 2020, but the only
possible indication of the tax year involved is from a handwritten notation of “2017” at the
top  of  the  page.  None  of  these  “receipts”  conclusively  shows  the  substance  of  the
mailings, and Applicant did not provide a copy of any completed tax returns.
