Applicant denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a, and partially admitted and denied the
allegations in ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,
testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 61 years old. He married for the third time in 2001. He and his wife
share seven children ranging in ages from 39 to 18 years old. His wife is the president of
a company and vice president of another company. Applicant has worked for his current
employer, a federal contractor, since 2005. He is also self-employed part-time on the side
as the owner of his own company. (Tr. 115-119; GE 1, 2)
Applicant and his wife purchased a house in 2001. Between 2005 and 2011, they
experienced  family  emergencies  that  impacted  their  finances.  This  included  caring  for
parents and children’s health issues. In 2015, they experienced another health issue with
one of the children that affected their finances. (Tr. 119, 181-183, 200)
Applicant and  his wife  acquired  a  $40,000  home  equity  loan  in 2008  that was used
for  home   improvements  and   to   pay   credit  card  debts.   Due   to   other   unexpected   family
emergencies they  began  having  difficulties making  their  mortgage  payments  in the  later
part of  2008. In  2013,  they  applied  for mortgage  relief  to  have  the  mortgage’s interest  rate
decreased. Although  it was decreased, it was not as helpful as they  had  anticipated,  and
they   fell   behind   in   their   mortgage   payments.  They   retained   an   attorney   to   help  them
negotiate  a  better term  and  prevent  foreclosure. The  attorney  was unsuccessful.  (Tr.  121-
137, 183-186; AE A, B, C, D, E, F)
Applicant  retained  another  attorney.  The  process  of  dealing  with  the  mortgage
company  was  long  and  cumbersome.  Despite  attempting  to  obtain  a  modification,  the
attorney eventually negotiated a “cash for keys” resolution. Applicant received $4,500 in
cash,  and  the  mortgage  company  received  the  property  and  agreed  to  waive  the
deficiency balance, so there was no further financial obligation. The deficiency balance
at the time was $272,794. In Applicant’s wife’s affidavit, she stated that they lived in the
house until 2019 when the transaction was finalized. Applicant admitted, to the best of his
recollection, that for approximately three years, while he was seeking a mortgage loan
modification, he did not pay the mortgage or the homeowner’s fees, essentially living in
the home rent-free. Applicant reported this financial issue to his facility security officers at
the time. Applicant now rents a home. (Tr. 121-137, 186-190; GE 5, 6, 7; AE A, B, C, D,
E, F, G, H, I, J)
Applicant testified that beginning in 2001, after he and his wife married, she was
responsible  for  filing  their  federal  income  tax  returns  because  she  was  a  successful
businessperson who analyzed contracts and was experienced in finances. He said she
filed their tax returns from 2001 through 2012, and there were no issues. He stated that
he never inquired about whether their tax returns were timely filed. (Tr. 138-140)
Applicant’s  wife   provided   an   affidavit.  She   stated   that   after  they   married   she
assumed  the  responsibility  to  file  their  federal  income  tax  returns  because  of  her business
background. Applicant provided  financial information  to  his wife. In  her affidavit she  said
that  Applicant would inquire  “how  it was going  and  if  I  needed  anything.” (Tr. 138-139; AE
A) She  further stated  in her affidavit:
From 2001 to 2012, I prepared written returns that [I] filed with the IRS in
paper form. The IRS received these returns. I started using Turbo Tax to
prepare and file our returns beginning in 2013.
I recall preparing and timely filing our 2013-2018 tax returns using Turbo
Tax. The IRS received our 2014 return, but they apparently did not receive
our 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 returns. I am not certain as to the
cause of the problem. I assumed that they were filed and received by the
IRS until the IRS advised us that information in their possession indicated
we  owed  taxes  for  2013.  I  am  not  certain  when  we  received  this  notice.
[Applicant] hired an accountant who helped us get the 2013 return in the
hands of the IRS. I am a bit fuzzy on the actual dates when this occurred.
I also prepared and e-filed our return for 2014, which the IRS received. I did
the same for tax years 2015-2018, but as we found out sometime later, the
IRS said it had not received them.
Each year when [Applicant] would ask me if the returns had been filed, I told
[him] they had as I was sure that I had filed them properly. I did mention to
[Applicant] from time to time that my business partnerships had complicated
our returns, but that I still felt comfortable preparing them. (AE A)
Applicant completed  his security  clearance  application   (SCA)  in June  2017. In  it
he   disclosed   that  he   failed   to   pay   2013   federal  income   taxes.  He   disclosed   he   was
disputing  the  amount  that the  IRS  claimed  he  owed  and  that he  had  hired  an  accountant,
Mr. B,  to  determine  the  accurate  amount before he  began  making  payments. He noted
that  his wife’s partnerships made  it complicated  to  calculate  the  amount actually  owed. At
that  time,  he   estimated   they   owed   approximately   $25,000.  He  disclosed   that  his  2016
federal tax  return had  not yet been  filed,  and  Mr. B  had  filed  an  extension. (Extensions
past  the  April 15th  filing  date  are  due  on  October  15th.)  He  estimated  he  owed  $150,000
in  unpaid  income  taxes.  Applicant  also  noted  in  his  SCA  that  he  was  attempting  to
refinance his home in lieu of foreclosure at that time. (Tr. 160-163; GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s  2013   federal  income   tax   transcript   reflects  there   was  an   extension
granted  for filing  the  return, but the  IRS  did not receive  the  return until  December 2014,
which  was   late.  However,  the   return  was  received,  apparently   through   Turbo   Tax,  as
Applicant’s wife  stated. Because  it was filed  late, penalties and  interest  were imposed.
Originally   Applicant  received   a   refund   for   2013.  In   May   2016,  an   additional  amount  of
$29,983  tax  was accessed  due  to  unreported  income, along  with  penalties and  interest.
A  notice  to  Applicant was issued  in  April 2016  about the  additional  assessment.  The  2013
tax   transcript  shows  Applicant   had   appointed   a   representative,  Mr.  B,   in  May   2016.  A
second  notice  was sent in July  2017  and  again in November 2018. (Tr. 36-40,  87-93, 102-
104, 141, 146-149; AE K)
In  March  2019,  an  installment  agreement  was  established  and  Applicant  made
sequential monthly payments of $500 for seven months, one monthly payment of $750,
and one monthly payment of $1,000 in February 2020. He failed to make another payment
until July 2020, which was $1,500. Applicant was making these payments to a collection
agency  after  the  debt  was  transferred  by  the  IRS.  Applicant  testified  that  he  stopped
making  payments  on  the  advice  of  Mr.  B  because  Mr.  B  was  getting  ready  to  file
delinquent  returns  and  it  would  automatically  trigger  the  stop.  He  would  then  have  a
representative negotiate a payment plan with the IRS based on the total amount owed.
The  plan  was  terminated  in  December  2020.  The  tax  transcript  showed  an  account
balance  of  $28,608.  It  also  showed  that  in  March  of  2016,  the  IRS  noted  there  was
unreported income for this tax year. (Tr. 36-40, 87-93, 102-104, 141, 146-149; AE K)
Applicant hired a tax expert accountant, Mr. H, in January 2021. Mr. H testified on
behalf of Applicant. He explained that one of the reasons an IRS installment agreement
might  be  terminated  is  when  there  is  a  new  tax  liability  for  a  subsequent  year  or  if  a
payment is missed. He stated that tax notices are sent by mail and addressed to the last
known address of record. In Applicant’s case, the notice would have been sent to where
he lived in 2014. The same address he was at until he moved sometime in 2019 after he
accepted a settlement with the mortgage company.  The last notice of  November 2018
indicated the debt was transferred to a private debt collector. (Tr. 19-22, 40-43; AE K)
Mr. H also explained  that tax  transcripts show  a  received  date  and  a  processing
date. The  received  date  is what determines  whether the  return was late. The  processing
date is the  date that the return is considered  filed.  A request for an  extension to  file  a tax
return must be  submitted  by  a  form  and  the  IRS acknowledges it in the  transcript. (Tr. 43-
44
Applicant’s  2014  tax  transcript  indicates  that  a  federal  income  tax  return  was
received in April 2015 and was timely. Tax year 2014 was the only year from 2013 through
2018 that an extension to file was not requested. Applicant received a $6,737 refund. His
2015 tax transcript indicates Applicant filed for an extension for tax year 2015. It further
indicated that his 2015 federal income tax return was received in June 2020. According
to Mr. H, the IRS does not immediately notify a person if their return is not timely filed. It
may send a notice two to three years after the due date indicating the return was not filed
or filed late, and the IRS may complete a substitute return. Applicant’s tax liability for 2015
was $31,183. As of June 2021, that liability has increased with penalties and interest to
$55,130. Applicant stated in his June 2019 answers to government interrogatories that
the reason his 2015 tax returns were not filed was because his wife thought she mailed
it. He testified that this is what his wife told him. This contradicts what she stated in her
affidavit that the return was filed through Turbo Tax. (Tr. 31-33, 45-52, 96-98, 171-173;
GE 3; AE K)
Applicant’s 2016 tax transcript indicates that in April 2017 he filed for an extension
to file his tax return. The IRS received his 2016 tax return in June 2020. He failed to timely
file the return. He owed approximately $13,269 at the time, but with penalties and interest,
as of June 2021, he owed $22,988 for tax year 2016. (Tr. 52-53, 98; AE K)
Applicant’s 2017 tax transcript indicates that in April 2018 he filed for an extension
to file his tax return. The IRS received his 2017 tax return in June 2020. He failed to timely
file  the  return.  He  owed  approximately  $7,993  with  penalties  and  interest.  The  tax
transcript notes that in July 2019, the IRS  issued a notice that told Applicant to file his
personal tax return immediately. Further it noted that in August 2019, Applicant had given
a power of attorney to a representative to act on his behalf. This person was Mr. B. It is
unknown why if Applicant had been working with Mr. B since completing his June 2017
SCA,  his  tax  returns  for  2017  and  2018  were  not  timely  filed.  Applicant  said  he  was
unaware until approximately late 2018 or 2019 that he had years of unfiled tax returns.
Applicant  testified  that  Mr.  B  asked  Applicant’s  wife  for  proof  that  she  had  filed  the
delinquent returns, and she could not find copies for any of the years in question. Mr. B
filed Applicant’s 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 tax returns in June 2020. (Tr. 53-55, 86-87,
165-169, 194; AE K
Applicant’s 2018 tax transcript indicates that in April 2019 he filed for an extension
to file his tax return. The IRS received his 2018 tax return in June 2020. He failed to timely
file the return. The tax transcript shows that he owed $6,036 taxes and with penalties and
interest the balance was $8,378, which he paid in January 2021. (Tr. 55-56; AE K)
Applicant’s  2019  federal  income  tax  return  was  received  by  the  IRS  in  October
2020. It was timely filed due to the government extending the due date because of the
pandemic. The tax owed was $7,555, and it was paid in January 2021. Mr. H prepared
Applicant’s 2020 federal income tax return and it was timely filed. Applicant owed $8,438,
which included a small late penalty for not prepaying the taxes. It is paid. (Tr. 144-146;
Tr. 56-60; AE K)
Mr. H testified that the total tax debt Applicant owed was approximately $115,198
as of June 2021. In June 2021, Mr. H started the process of negotiating a payment plan
with the IRS. In anticipation of the payment plan, Applicant made payments of $1,600 in
May and June 2021 to be applied to the 2017 tax debt. An additional payment of $1,757
was  made  in  July  2021  to  be  applied  to  the  2017  tax  debt.  Shortly  after  the  hearing
concluded,  Applicant  provided  confirmation  of  an  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS,
whereby he would make monthly payments of $1,757 beginning in August 2021 over a
period of six years or 72 payments, to be applied to balances owed for tax years 2013,
2015, 2016, and 2017. Applicant testified he can afford this amount of the payment. Mr.
H  testified  that  the  IRS  indicated  that  a  tax  lien  would  be filed  once  the  payment  plan
commenced because of the amount owed. The lien would cover all assets Applicant and
his wife own. Mr. H explained that basically the IRS owns the equity in anything Applicant
and his wife own. Applicant also provided documents to show he paid his federal taxes
owed for tax year 2020, and he made two estimated tax payments for tax year 2021. (Tr.
60-72, 93-96, 107-109, 149-157; AE M, N, O, P, Q, S, T1, T2, U)
Mr. H testified that he uses a professional grade tax filing software. He stated that
he has not used Turbo Tax in the past ten years. He was previously aware that Turbo
Tax will acknowledge a return is submitted and by email will indicate the IRS received the
return. He stated that he is aware that if tax is owed and not paid, the IRS will send notices
usually  within  30  days  after  the  return  is  filed.  In  response  to  Department  Counsel’s
question, Mr. H stated that he would not be surprised to learn that Turbo Tax keeps copies
of tax filings made by taxpayers. Neither Applicant, his wife, Mr. B nor Mr. H requested
copies of Applicant’s 2013 through 2018 Turbo Tax returns. After being hired, Mr. H used
Applicant’s  official  IRS  tax  transcripts  and  whatever  information  Applicant  provided  to
address Applicant’s tax problems. Applicant did not provide copies of tax returns his wife
said  were  filed  for  the  years  in  question.  The  IRS  recommends  maintaining  copies  of
federal tax returns for three years. Mr. H recommends maintaining copies for seven years.
(Tr. 25-31, 74-85, 99, 196-197)
Applicant owes taxes for tax years 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Applicant testified
that his wife never told him they owed taxes for those years. Applicant’s wife’s affidavit
did  not  explain  why,  if  she  timely  filed  the  federal  tax  returns  as  she  stated,  she  and
Applicant failed to pay the taxes when due as required. The tax transcripts do not support
any payments were made. No documents were offered by Applicant to show he or his
wife  paid  the  taxes  when  they  were  due.  Proof  of  payment  would  provide  some
corroboration  that  the  tax  returns  were  filed.  (Tr.  201)  I  did  not  find  Applicant’s  wife’s
affidavit credible.
Applicant  provided a  character letter from his  supervisor.  She described  him  as
dependable,  level-headed,  and  trustworthy.  He  complies  with  procedures  and  policies
with regard to ethical business practices, information technology, and program security.
He is respected by his peers, management and customers. (Tr. 157; AE R)
