The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy that
was discharged in January 2009 (SOR ¶ 1.a), and he failed to timely file his federal and
state income tax returns for tax years 2007 through 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.b). Additionally, as of
June 7, 2019, Applicant allegedly owed delinquent federal taxes of $22,834 (SOR ¶ 1.c);
state X taxes of at least $2,629 (SOR ¶ 1.d); a credit-card collection debt of $460 (SOR ¶
1.e); $103,715 on a bank loan (student loan) that was $2,055 past due (SOR ¶ 1.f); federal
student loans in collection for $1,760 (SOR ¶ 1.g) and $5,837 (SOR ¶ 1.h); $28,350 on a
federal tax lien from December 2009 (SOR ¶ 1.i); wireless phone debts in collection for
$725 (SOR ¶ 1.j) and $928 (SOR ¶ 1.k); and a utility debt in collection for $439 (SOR ¶ 1.l).
Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have deliberately falsified his September 27,
2017 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (hereafter SF 86) by
falsely denying that he had failed to file federal or state tax returns or pay federal or state
taxes when required by law in the preceding seven years (SOR ¶ 2.a) and by failing to
disclose that he had a federal lien against him for failing to pay taxes or other debts and by
denying that he was currently delinquent on any federal debt (SOR ¶ 2.b).
When he responded to the SOR, Applicant admitted the bankruptcy discharge, the
failure to file his income tax returns, the tax lien, the delinquent debts, and the deliberate
omission  of  his  tax  issues  from  his  SF  86.  As  for  the  debts,  he  stated  that  he  had
established payment plans for the following debts: the state-tax delinquency, which he
indicated  was  currently  $1,826  (SOR  ¶  1.d);  the  credit-card  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.e);  the
educational loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.f-1.h), which he had consolidated and no longer considered in
default; the federal taxes (SOR ¶ 1.i); and the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.j-1.k, which he planned to
repay pursuant to settlement agreements. He stated that he no longer owed the utility debt
in SOR ¶ 1.l because it had been written off. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and
transcript, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 49-year-old electrical draftsman and designer, who has worked for a
defense contractor since December 2017. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 33.) He has never married and
has no children. He has lived in a house owned by his mother, rent-free, since January
2008, except for a brief period from March 2013 to June 2013, when he rented in another
state.  (GE  1;  AE  A;  Tr.  39.)  His  mother  pays  the  taxes,  homeowner’s  insurance,  and
utilities on the house. (Tr. 39.)
Applicant earned his bachelor’s degree in architecture in June 2003. (GE 1; Tr. 34.)
About six months later, he began working at a university. About two years later, he began
working primarily in computer-aided design (CAD) in the architectural building industry, and
he continued in this occupation until the economic downturn in 2008. He worked for smaller
firms and went from job to job easily, trying to acquire the skills and experience needed to
become a licensed architect. (Tr. 35-36.) He bought a two-family home in the spring of
2006,  which  he  financed  for $240,000.  (Tr. 36-37.) He  struggled  to  pay his mortgage,
especially  after  his  renters  moved  out,  and  he  eventually  defaulted  on  his  loan.  He
abandoned the property in about January 2008 and moved into a home owned by his
mother. (Tr. 38-39.)
After the mortgage crisis hit, Applicant had only temporary jobs that lasted a few
weeks to a few months between August 2008 and January 2013. He was not eligible for
unemployment compensation because he had been a temporary (1099) employee. (GE 2;
Tr. 37-39.) He largely spent his time watching his sister’s children, and traveling, including
to U.S. national parks. From February 2013 to August 2013, Applicant was employed by a
two-person architectural firm with a small budget. After his projects were completed, he
was unemployed from September 2013 to October 2015, except for a brief period from
June to July 2015 when he was terminated for failing to meet the company’s expectations
(GE 2), and during this period, he also worked as a 1099 Uber driver. (Tr. 41.) Otherwise,
during his lengthy unemployment, he took some classes at a community college to sharpen
his AutoCAD drafting and information technology skills. His student loans were deferred.
(Tr. 41.) From November 2015 to May 2016, Applicant had full-time work as a CAD drafter
contracted by a temporary employment agency to work on electrical diagrams for a utility
company. He then worked through a job placement agency at $25 an hour for a small
company in the building industry from June 2016 to August 2017, when he was laid off.
(GE 1; Tr. 43.)
Applicant completed an SF 86 on September 27, 2017, for his current employer. He
disclosed a trip to Europe to visit friends in June 2013. He responded negatively to all of
the financial record inquiries, including the following:
In the last seven (7) years have you failed to file or pay Federal, state, or
other taxes when required by law or ordinance?;
Other than previously listed, have any of the following happened to you?
In the last seven (7) years, you had a lien placed against your property or
failing to pay taxes or other debts. (Include financial obligations for which you
were  the  sole  debtor,  as  well  as  those  for  which  you  were  a  cosigner or
guarantor);
You  are  currently  delinquent  on  any  Federal  debt.  (Include  financial
obligations for which you are the sole debtor, as well as those for which you
are a cosigner or guarantor). (GE 1.)
Applicant desperately wanted a full-time job with a good company so he could turn
his life around. He found himself unable to compete with newer graduates in architecture,
who had updated computer skills that he did not possess, and he wanted to buy another
home. Having read and understood the penalties for making a false statement on the SF
86, he now admits that he deliberately falsified his responses to the federal tax and debt
questions. He was filled with anxiety and desperate to get a job. He feared he would lose
the job opportunity if he answered correctly. (Tr. 49-51, 64.) His financial situation at that
time was not good. He was about to default on his student loans and owed the IRS a
substantial sum. He had utility debts he could not pay. (Tr. 52.) He now regrets his lack of
candor and asserts that it will not happen again. (Tr. 64.)
Applicant denied any current delinquencies when he completed his SF 86. (GE 1.)
However,  as  of  October  6,  2017,  Applicant’s  credit  report  showed  that  he  had  filed  a
Chapter  7  bankruptcy  petition  in  October  2008,  and  he  was  granted  a  bankruptcy
discharge in January 2009 (SOR ¶ 1.a). A December 2009 federal tax lien for $28,350 had
not been released (SOR ¶ 1.i). Two federal student loans opened in January 2014 and
March  2014  were  in  collection  for  $2,957  (SOR  ¶  1.g)  and  $10,459  (SOR  ¶  1.h),
respectively. A credit-card account, opened in March 2010, was in collection for $465 (SOR
¶ 1.e) due to inactivity since June 2015. Two educational loans (one subsidized and one
unsubsidized)  opened  in  June  2004  were  in  deferment  with  a  consolidated  $94,699
balance (SOR ¶ 1.f). (GE 4.)
During a January 29, 2018 interview by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
investigator, Applicant was asked whether he had any accounts in collection status. He
admitted that he defaulted on his student loans, and a few other accounts, but he could
provide  no  details. When  confronted  with  the  adverse information  on  his credit record,
Applicant stated  that the  tax  lien  was for owing  taxes from  2002  to  2009. He then  related
that he  had  not filed  tax  returns for tax   years 2015  and  2016, because  he  mistakenly  had
believed that he had filed for an extension of the filing deadline  and  when  he  realized  he
had  not done  so, it was “too  late” to  file. He admitted  that he  feared  he  might owe  taxes
that he  could not pay. Applicant claimed  that he  did not think his failure to  disclose  his tax
issues on  his SF 86  would be  critical to  his background  investigation.  He stated  that he
was working with  an  accountant and  that his tax  returns for tax  years 2002  through  2009
should be filed, but he did not know  for certain.  (GE 2.) He presently  recalls having  hired
the  accountant in 2018. (Tr. 53.) Applicant admitted  when  asked  by  the  investigator  that  he
had   filed   for  bankruptcy   in  2008   because   he   wanted   to   eliminate   his  debts,   which  he
claimed  consisted  of  about $25,000  in credit-card debt and  a  $240,000  mortgage  loan  in
foreclosure. Applicant explained  that he  was currently  attempting  to  repair  his financial
issues  and   that  he   planned   on   filing   his  tax   returns  for  2017   and   making   an   offer-in-
compromise with  the  IRS. Applicant expressed  his belief  that he  was not at fault for his
financial issues. He was unable to  find  a  stable job  due  to  “bad  luck and  the  economy.”
Applicant acknowledged  that he  had  previously  made  no  effort to address his bad debts
but he  was now  motivated  by  his background  investigation  to  begin  repaying  his  debts.  (GE
2.)
Applicant  was  re-interviewed  by  the  OPM  investigator  on  February 9,  2018,  for
information about his accounts in collections, his bankruptcy, and his tax issues. Applicant
failed to provide information about many of the accounts. Information provided about his
bankruptcy shows that he filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in October 2008  listing
$243,087  in  secured  debt;  $121,882  in  unsecured  priority debts,  consisting of  student
loans, a state income tax liability of $1,669 from 2007, and $1,862 in property taxes); and
$58,054 in unsecured nonpriority debts. He was granted a discharge in January 2009. In
his  bankruptcy  filing,  Applicant  reported  no  current  income,  but  $28,220  in  gross  self-
employment income in 2008, and $4,095 in monthly expenses. Applicant gave the OPM
investigator  letters  showing  he  had  rehabilitated  two  student  loans  with  an  aggregate
balance of $94,699 (SOR ¶ 1.f), and, as of February 8, 2018, Applicant was working with
his accountant to file his income tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016;  he had filed
through  his  accountant  tax  returns  for  “all  other  years;”  and  he  was  planning to  make
repayment arrangements through his accountant with the IRS to address past-due taxes
totaling $22,834 ($6,600 for 2007, $8,932 for 2008, $6,655 for 2013, and $584 for 2014) as
of October 2017. (GE 2.) Applicant now asserts that his federal income tax liability for 2008
has been written off due to the statute of limitations. (AE E-1.)
In response to Interrogatories, Applicant indicated on January 5, 2019, that he had
no record of whether he had filed his federal and state income tax returns for tax years
2007 and 2008, although he suspected that he filed returns. He admitted that he had filed
late federal and state returns for tax years 2009 through 2017, and indicated that he owed
past-due federal taxes, exclusive of penalties and interest, of $22 for 2009, $200 for 2011,
$227 for 2012, $4,048 for 2013, $323 for 2014, $32 for 2015, $4,789 for 2016, and $3,000
for 2017. He reported that he owed back state taxes of $819 for 2013, $102 for 2016, and
$39 for 2017, but did not specify which state was owed the taxes. He gave the following
explanation for filing late and not paying his taxes:
The   reason   for filing   late   and   not  paying   is entirely   my   fault.  For most  of
those  years I was paid on  a  1099  status. I had  little tax  withheld from  my  W-
2, which resulted  in me  owing  taxes year after year. This was not intentional
but due  to  the  fact that I was not making  enough  money  to  pay  all  my  living
expenses and  pay  all  my  taxes. I put my  head  in the  sand  and  avoided  this
issue  for way  to  [sic] many  years. I am  now  on  a  W-2 income  status with
[employer name] and will be paying all my taxes. . . . (GE 2.)
At his hearing, Applicant testified that he did not file timely tax returns for a couple of
reasons.  He  thought  that  because  he  could  not  pay  taxes  owed,  he  could  not  file  his
returns, and he was “afraid to file taxes.” He acknowledged that it was “a mistake” to not
file his tax returns when they were due. (Tr. 43.)
On  April  16,  2020,  Applicant’s  accountant  reported  that,  with  his  assistance,
Applicant’s tax  returns for tax  years 2007  through  2017  were filed  late; Applicant’s tax
returns for tax year 2018 were filed; and his $1,661 federal tax refund for 2018 was applied
to  his  federal  tax  balance  to  bring  his  federal  tax  liability  to  about  $20,000.  (AE  A.)
According to Applicant’s federal and state income tax returns, his tax returns for tax year
2015 through 2017 were completed in mid-November 2018. On federal adjusted gross
income of $9,593 for 2015, he overpaid his federal taxes by $32 and his state income
taxes by $179 to state X, where he had earned income but does not reside. On federal
adjusted gross income of $36,755 for 2016, he underpaid his federal income taxes by
$4,789, but he expected a state refund of $97 from state X for 2016. On federal adjusted
gross income of $36,706 for 2017, he underpaid his federal income taxes by $3,000. He
expected a refund of $55 from his state of residency (state Y) and $153 from state X. (AE
B.)
An IRS account transcript for tax year 2018 shows that Applicant’s tax return was
received on June 19, 2019. His income tax refund of $1,661 on wage income of $56,467
was intercepted by the IRS. He underpaid state income taxes by $989 for tax year 2018 to
state Z, the state where he is currently employed. (AE B.) According to his 2019 state
income tax return, he paid those taxes with his 2018 return. (AE C.) He expected a tax
refund of $679 from state Y. (AE B.) His federal and state income tax returns for tax year
2019 were completed on October 8, 2020. (AE C.)
With  his accountant’s help, Applicant advanced  $2,500  to  the  IRS  on  November 7,
2019, as a  first step  in obtaining  an  offer-in-compromise.  (AEs A, AE  E-1, E-7.) He made
one  $300  payment on  November 29, 2019, under an  installment agreement covering  the
taxes owed  for tax  years 2008  and  2013, 2014, 2016, and  2017  totaling  $27,684, but then
made  no  further payments on  that agreement.  (AE  E-7; Tr. 54.) Applicant testified  that he
was  told  not  to   make   any   further  payments  while   the   IRS   processed   his  offer-in-
compromise,   and   he   did  not  learn  until  early   2021   that  the   IRS   rejected   his  offer-in-
compromise because  he  had  employment income  with  which to  make  payments.  (Tr. 55-
56.) Applicant recently entered into a new installment agreement to repay $200 monthly
toward his federal tax liability for tax years 2013 through 2017. As of April 7, 2021, he owed
a total of $17,210 (inclusive of penalties and interest) for those tax years. (AE C; AE E-6;
Tr. 56.) His tax refunds for 2018 and 2019 were intercepted and applied by the IRS to his
tax liability. (Tr. 56.)
In February 2020, Applicant entered into an agreement with state X to resolve the
$1,745 balance of his tax delinquency (SOR ¶ 1.d) by monthly payments of at least $150.
Applicant did not make the payments, and the state issued him a notice of delinquency
totaling $1,800 as of September 2020. (AE E-8.) On October 27, 2020, Applicant paid
$1,806 to fully resolve the debt.  (AE E-9.)
Applicant’s federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2019 were completed
by his accountant on October 8, 2020, and filed electronically. On adjusted gross income of
$56,399, Applicant overpaid his federal income taxes by $1,082. He owed $719 to state Z,
apparently because of inadequate tax withholdings (Tr. 58), but $707 in tax overpayment
was refunded to him by state Y. (AE C.) Both states X and Z indicate Applicant is currently
in compliance with his tax obligations. (AE E-10; AE F.)
As for his educational and consumer-credit delinquencies, as of May 15, 2019,
Applicant had not paid the $460 credit-card collection debt (SOR 1.e). He had not made his
scheduled monthly payment of $383 since December 2018 on the student loan in SOR ¶
1.f, and his account was $2,055 past due. His federal student loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.g-1.h) were
in collections. He had resolved one collection debt of $465 (not alleged) in July 2018. He
had recently obtained a car loan for $18,981 in March 2019, which he agreed to repay at
$384 monthly for 72 months. (GE 3.) His mother gave him approximately $6,500 to enable
him to purchase the vehicle. (AE A, AE E-12.) Applicant fell behind 30 days on his car loan
in May 2020. He has otherwise been current on his payments. (AE D.) As of March 2021,
the balance of the car loan was $16,987. (AE E-11.)
In November 2019, Applicant consolidated his student loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.f-1.h) for a
new loan of $112,071. Applicant’s wages were garnished over the course of two years in
the amount of “nearly $8,000” to bring his student loans out of default so that he could
consolidate them. (Tr. 59.) As of March 31, 2021, the balance was $113,715. (AE D; Tr.
59.) He had made one monthly payment of $445 as of his hearing. He intends to apply for
an income-based repayment plan, which he understands will reduce his monthly student-
loan payment to about $380 per month. (Tr. 83.)
Applicant settled the $725 wireless phone debt in collections for $471. He made his
final payment, which was in the amount of $157, to fully settle the debt on December 27,
2019.  (AE  E-3.)  Applicant  satisfied  the  credit-card  collections  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  by
February 5, 2020. (AE E-2.) With a final payment of $103 posted on February 3, 2020,
Applicant settled the collection debt in SOR ¶ 1.k. (AE E-4.) On May 10, 2021, Applicant
paid $439 to resolve the balance owed the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.l (AE E-5), even though he
asserts that the debt was discharged in his 2008 bankruptcy. (AE E.)
Applicant has continued to rely on credit. He obtained a $5,000 line of  credit in
March 2020. He was 90 days late on that account in September 2020, “which was [his]
mistake,” but he then made a $5,452 payment on October 26, 2020, to pay off the debt.
(AE E-9, E-11; Tr. 59, 61.) He withdrew $23,000 from his 401(k) at work to obtain the funds
to pay that debt, his state taxes to states Y and Z, and for repairs to his residence. (AE E;
Tr. 60, 75-76.) He purchased new furniture, a new lawn mower, and a new window. He
also had a high car insurance bill that he had to pay. (Tr. 76-77.) Some of the funds went to
his model-train hobby. (Tr. 78.) He has no funds remaining from that withdrawal. (Tr. 77.)
In addition to the large 401(k) withdrawal to address the line-of-credit debt, Applicant
has borrowed $5,000 from his 401(k) at work twice in the last 18 to 24 months. (Tr. 80.) As
of  August 22, 2020, he was repaying those 401(k) loans at $69 each directly from his
weekly paycheck. (AE F.) They were on 18-month repayment plans. (Tr. 75.) He testified
that the second of these loans will be paid off in July 2021, and the other loan is paid off.
(Tr. 73-74.) Applicant used about $3,000 of the loan monies to pay for a trip to Europe from
December 2019 to January 2020 to visit longtime friends. (Tr. 78-80.) He testified that he
works a lot and “like[s] to live a bit and see [his] friends in [Europe] and to fix up the house.”
He expressed a goal to stop withdrawing or borrowing funds from his 401(k) once he turns
50  years  old.  (Tr.  79.)  Six  to  eight  weeks  before  his  May  2021  hearing,  he  borrowed
another $600 from his 401(k). He is repaying the debt at $13 per week from his paycheck.
(Tr. 80-81.) He borrowed the money to fix up the house, and pay off the debt in SOR ¶ 1.l
to “make a good impression to the DOD that [he is] caught up on all [his] bills.” (Tr. 82.) He
does not believe that his borrowing is a reflection of who he is. (Tr. 80.)
Applicant opened  a  credit-card account in  February  2020  with  a  home-improvement
retailer. The  account had  a  $500  credit limit and  was current as of  March 2021  with  a  $476
balance. He opened  a  revolving  charge  account with  a  retailer in  October  2019  with  a  $150
credit limit. As of  March 2021, that account was current with  a  $91  balance. (AE  D; AE  E-
11.)  Applicant owes a  couple of  medical bills, $300 for an  eye  examination  and  $650  or
$700  for orthopedic x-rays, which he  believes should be  covered  by  his  medical  insurance.
(Tr. 63, 68.)
Applicant’s take-home pay is about $608 a week. (Tr. 65.) From that income, he has
committed to paying $445 per month on his student loan, $385 per month on his auto loan,
and $200 per month to the IRS. He pays about $250 a month for a trainer and nutritionist.
Other monthly expenses include about $400 for groceries; $400 to $450 for gasoline and
other car expenses; $85 for Internet service; $50 for his cell-phone service; and $18 for
Netflix. (Tr. 66-67.) He has about $331 in monthly discretionary income. (Tr. 67.)
Applicant’s mother has helped him financially since 2008. In addition to providing
him with living quarters rent free, she gave him money many times between 2008 and
2017. She remains able and willing to assist Applicant financially in the future. (AE A.)
Applicant has received therapy for anxiety and depression from a psychiatric nurse
affiliated with a psychiatry practice since  2009. (Tr. 42.) She indicates that his mental-
health  issues  were  exacerbated  by  the  adverse  employment  events,  but  that  his
employment with the defense contractor has led to a decrease in his symptoms. (AE B, AE
E-13.) He currently has therapy once a week. (Tr. 42.) Because of the deductible on his
health insurance, he had to pay her $750 to $800 for his sessions in 2021 as of late May
2021. (Tr. 72-73.)
