Applicant is 48 years old. He was born in Somalia. In 1991, a civil war broke out in
Somalia, and Applicant’s mother and  younger brother were killed. He, along with other
family members, escaped on a fishing boat in 1992. They were taken to a refugee camp
in  Kenya.  In  May  1996,  when  he  was  about  23  years-old,  he  and his family  members
were brought to the United States as Somalian refugees. (Tr. 20-21, 82-83; GE 1, GE 2,
GE 3)
Applicant  attended  college  in  the  U.S.  from  1998  to  2004,  and  earned  an
associate’s degree and a bachelor’s degree in marketing. He became a naturalized U.S.
citizen in 2003, and he married his wife, who is a dual citizen of Kenya and the U.S., in
2004. He has two children, ages six and eight. His children are U.S. citizens. He currently
works for two different companies doing translations. In 2019, he earned approximately
$51,000  from  his  two  employers,  and  his  wife  earned  about  $105,000  as  a  registered
nurse.  In  2020,  he  only  earned  $28,000  due  to  the  lack  of  translation  work  from  the
immigration  courts  closure  from  the  Covid-19  pandemic,  and  his  wife  earned  about
$89,000. He is applying for a linguist position with a DOD contractor. His employment is
contingent on him obtaining a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 20-22, 47, 75-77; GE 1, GE

Foreign Influence:
Applicant has three sisters. Two of his sisters are naturalized citizens and residents
of the United States, and the third sister is a citizen of Sweden currently residing in the
United Kingdom. He also has four brothers. Three of his brothers are naturalized citizens
and  residents  of  the  United  States,  and  his  fourth  brother  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of
Somalia.  This  brother  had  previously  been  incarcerated  in  the  United  States  for  drug-
related offenses, but in the Fall of 2020, he was deported to Somalia. Applicant saw his
brother during his trip to Somalia in late 2020, after the death of his father. Applicant does
not have a good relationship with this brother, and he does not want anything to do with
him, to include continuing contacts or providing financial support. Applicant’s two sisters
and three brothers residing in the United States intend to remain in the United States, and
they have no future intentions to visit Somalia. (Tr. 32-34, 53-56, 79-80; GE 1, GE 2, GE

Applicant  has  numerous  cousins  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Somalia.
Approximately  four  of  these  cousins  receive  financial  support  from  Applicant  and  his
family members about two or three times a year. It is usually related to a relief effort, and
they have collectively sent much more money than $3,650 since 2013, as alleged in SOR
¶ 1.c. The two or three times a year Applicant contributes money for his cousins usually
range between  $100  and  $200  per occurrence. It is only  on  an  “as needed” basis and
Applicant does not maintain regular contact with these cousins. (Tr. 27-28, 35-36, 56-59,
80-81; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3)
Applicant  has  two  friends  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Somalia.  He
communicates with them on a casual, infrequent basis. For example, seven months may
go by without any communication, and then all of a sudden, they may talk two-to-three
times, followed by several months of no contact. Both of these friends are unaware that
he is in the process of applying for a DOD security clearance, and neither of them are
employed by the Somalian government. (Tr. 36-37, 59-62, 81-82; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3)
Applicant’s friend’s father became President of a federal state in Somalia in 2017.
This  individual  is  no  longer  in  this  political  position.  On  one  occasion  in  2017,  while
Applicant was staying  with his friend during a trip to Somalia, his  friend’s father asked
Applicant  to  come  with  him  and  visit  two  foreign  embassies.  He  wanted  Applicant’s
assistance in the event he needed English translation while conducting business at the
embassies. This was not an offer of employment, but a one-time request for assistance.
Applicant did not provide any translation service for his father’s friend on that particular
day.  He  was  never  asked  to  provide  his  assistance  again,  and  he  does  not  maintain
contact with this individual. (Tr. 37-43, 63-64, 82; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3)
The final SOR allegation under Guideline B alleges that Applicant’s mother-in-law
and  father-in-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Kenya.  Since  2011,  he  and  his  spouse
have provided approximately $25,000 in financial support to them. Applicant testified that
his mother-in-law is in the U.S. as a permanent resident. She is currently employed in a
childcare facility. Applicant and his spouse do not always need to provide financial support
to her because of her employment. Applicant’s father-in-law is a citizen and remains a
resident in Kenya. He intended to relocate to the U.S. a few years ago, but he had back
surgery  which  required  a  recovery period,  and  then  the  Covid-19  pandemic prevented
him from coming into the U.S. At the current time, Applicant and his spouse continue to
provide monthly financial support to him, between $100 and $200 on an approximately
monthly  basis.  His  father-in-law  still  plans  to  relocate  to  the  U.S.  at  some  point  in  the
future. (Tr. 28-29, 43-44, 64-66; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3)
In 2014, Applicant was approached by an associate to open a Somalian restaurant
in Ethiopia. Applicant saw this as a promising business opportunity and invested $3,500.
He  eventually lost  his investment money as the restaurant never opened. In 2016,  his
friend’s  father,  mentioned  above,  had  a  mining  business  in  Kenya  that  needed  to  be
reopened.  Applicant  and  his  friend  were  offered  employment  to  resurrect  the  mining
business.  Applicant  looked  into  this  business  prospect  and  was  willing  to  relocate  his
family to Kenya if the business venture looked profitable. After evaluating the business,
he realized that it did not have a favorable outlook and discarded the offer of employment.
(Tr. 23-24, 44-46, 67-70, 82, 84; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3)
Applicant traveled to the United Kingdom, Somalia, and  to Kenya twice in 2012.
He traveled to Sweden for four months to visit his sister, the United Kingdom, Somalia,
and to Kenya twice in 2013. In 2016, he traveled to Somalia and made two trips to Kenya,
and in 2017 he traveled to Somalia and made two trips to Kenya  once again. Some of
Applicant’s visits to Somalia and Kenya were extended stays. Applicant testified that he
travelled to Somalia and Kenya in 2019 and in late 2020. He does not have any plans to
visit Somalia in the future. He personally funded all of his trips overseas. (Tr. 24-27, 31;
GE 1, GE 2, GE 3)
Financial Considerations
Applicant  has  approximately  $44,000  in  student  loans  that  were  referred  for
collection. He testified that he attended college in the U.S. from 1998 to 2004, and took
out these loans to pay for his education.  He received an associate’s degree in 2000, and
earned  his  bachelor’s  degree  in  2004.  He  began  repaying  his  student  loans  after
graduation, but stopped all payments  in about 2007 after he lost his job. He called his
student loan creditor and requested a loan forbearance due to unemployment, which was
granted. (Tr. 46-49, 70-75; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3)
After Applicant found employment again,  he made a request to the student loan
creditor that his monthly payments be reduced due to limited income. This request was
denied, and eventually his student loans were referred for collection. Years passed and
in  about  2010,  Applicant  was  told  by  the  student  loan  creditor  that  he  needed  to
rehabilitate his defaulted student loans by paying about $470 a month for six months, and
then  his  monthly  payment  would  be  reduced.  He  made  approximately  three  monthly
payments on his delinquent student loans, but then he was contacted by the student loan
creditor and informed that he needed to increase his monthly payment as another student
loan  had  been  included  in  the  student  loan  rehabilitation  payment  plan.  Thereafter,
Applicant  stopped  making  all  loan  payments,  and  he  has  not  made  any  student  loan
payments in the last decade. He admitted sending monetary support over the years to
foreign  family  members,  investing  $3,500  in  a  failed  business  venture,  and  travelling
extensively overseas since defaulting on his student loans. (Tr. 46-51, 70-73; GE 1, GE
2, GE 3)
Applicant admitted that he had been contacted several times by different collection
companies requesting payment over the years. He denied, however, any recent contacts
from a creditor requesting payment for his defaulted student loans. Currently, Applicant
stated that he is unable to determine who holds his defaulted student loans after a recent
attempt to re-establish communication. He had a tax refund intercepted by the Federal
government in about 2010, but after that time, he has received all of his tax refunds when
eligible. Applicant stated that it is his intention to repay his defaulted student loans, but
he  did  not  provide  details  of  his  future  plan  of  action,  or  when  he  anticipated  making
payments.  He  did  not  provide  any  documentation  of  his  recent  communications  with
student loan creditors. He does not have any other delinquent debts. (Tr. 46-51, 70-74;
GE 1, GE 2, GE 3)
Applicant submitted three character reference letters with his response to the SOR.
Overall, he is described as dependable, personable, caring, and a multi-tasker. He would
be a great asset to any organization. (AE B, AE C, AE D)
