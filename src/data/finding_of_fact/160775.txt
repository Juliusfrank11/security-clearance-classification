Applicant  denied  the  SOR  allegations.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and
evidence, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  48-year-old  employee  of  a  government  contractor.  She  began
working for her employer as an intake representative  in March 2018. She experienced
periods of unemployment from: February to March 2018; December 2013 to July 2014;
September  2012  to  July  2013;  and  June  2011  to  January  2012.  She  holds  an
associate’s  degree.  She  married  in  2007,  separated  from  her  husband  in  2010,  and
divorced  in  2016.  She  has  three  adult  children.  Her  ex-husband  failed  to  pay  child
support for these children when they were minors. She recently remarried in December
2020. (Tr. 7, 18, 22-23; GE 1, 2)
The SOR alleged that Applicant had five student loans in collection status totaling
$21,348. It also alleged two collection debts from an apartment lease obligation totaling
$3,659, and a consumer collection debt for $530. The debts were listed by Applicant in
her security clearance application (SCA) dated March 21, 2018;  discussed by her with
an  investigator  during  her  background  interview  in  May  2019;  and  listed  on  a  credit
report from April 2018. (GE 1, 2, 3)
Applicant  incurred  her  student  loan  debt  while  attending  technical  school  to
receive  her  associate’s  degree  from  2011-2012.  (SOR  1.a-1.e)  The  loans  were  in  a
forbearance  status  from  approximately  January  2013  until  2016.  Applicant  forgot  to
renew  her  forbearance  agreement  and  the  loans  became  delinquent  in  approximately
2017.  The  loans  were  assigned  to  a  collection  agency.  She  was  told  by  the  collector
that she qualified for a loan rehabilitation program. She made payments to the collector
before  September  2019,  but  she  does  not  have  supporting  documentation  for  those
payments.  She  documented  that  she  paid  the  required  monthly  payments  from
September 2019 to March 2020, when the loans were put in forbearance status due to
COVID-19.  The  loans  remain  in  forbearance.  When  she  was  making  payments,  they
were coming directly out of her bank account. She has sufficient funds to begin making
similar  payments  once  the  current forbearance  period  ends  and  she  intends  to  do  so.
These debts are being resolved. (Tr. 21, 26-29; AE B; SOR Answer)
After Applicant separated from her husband in 2010, she moved herself and her
children into an apartment complex in approximately 2012 and signed a lease. She lived
there  several  months  with  her  daughter  and  granddaughter.  While  living  there,  two
drive-by  shootings  occurred  at  the  complex.  For  safety  reasons,  Applicant  decided  to
give  30-days’  notice  of  termination  of  the  lease  to  the  apartment  manager  and  move
out.  She  was  given  eviction  papers  the  day  she  was  moving  out  of  the  complex.  She
never received any other documentation concerning the lease  or eviction. She learned
of  these  debts  by  reviewing  her  credit  report.  (SOR  1.f  and  1.g,  relate  to  the  same
underlying debt) She contacted the current apartment manager to work out a payment
arrangement, but was told that there was no record of her or the debt. Additionally, the
debt no longer appears on her credit report. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 19-20; GE 4-5;
SOR answer)
Applicant  credibly  testified  that  the  delinquent  consumer  debt  was  incurred  and
eventually paid by her ex-husband. She attempted to contact him so he could provide a
statement to that effect, but she was unable to do so. This debt is no longer showing on
her credit report. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 31; GE 2, 5)
Applicant  indicated  that  her  current  financial  status  is  much  improved.  She  and
her  second  husband  recently  purchased  a  home.  She  stated  that  after  paying  all
monthly  expenses,  they  have  a  remainder  of  approximately  $1,000.  They  use  this  to
make extra mortgage payments or to add to their savings. Her most current credit report
shows  no  delinquencies.  Additionally,  she  provided  a  character  statement  from  her
current  supervisor  who  described  Applicant  as  one  of  her  most  dependable  team
members. (Tr. 32-33; GE 5; AE A)
