The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  F  that,  as  of  December  12,  2019,  Applicant
owed $96,827 in federal student-loan debt in collection (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c, 1.g-1.h, and 1.j);
$19,074 in other loan or credit-card debt in collection (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.i, 1.k, 1.m-1.n, 1.q-
1.s, and 1.u-1.v) or charged off (SOR ¶¶ 1.e-1.f, 1.l, and 1.o-1.p); and a $381 utility debt
in collection (SOR ¶ 1.t). When Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, she admitted
all  of  the  debts.  She  also  indicated  that  she  was  following  a  monthly payment  plan  to
address her student loans, making payments on a $1,253 credit-card debt (SOR ¶ 1.u),
and seeking financial counseling to resolve her other consumer-credit obligations.
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact:
Applicant is a 58-year-old high school graduate who completed some classes at a
technical institute in 2011 and has been studying on and off at a community college since
January 2012, taking mostly online classes. She has yet to earn a degree. (GE 4; Tr. 36.)
She and her spouse have been married since May 1989. They have a 31-year-old son
and a 32-year-old daughter. (GE 1; Tr. 36-37.)
Applicant worked part time, about 25 hours per week at almost $16 an hour (Tr.
35), as a school bus driver from September 2006 to December 2010. Her spouse worked
in  construction  until  the  economic  downturn  of  2008-2009.  (Tr.  30,  34.)  He  collected
unemployment  for  about  60  weeks.  (Tr.  34.)  They  made  minimum  payments  on  their
credit-card accounts on her part-time income and his unemployment compensation until
his unemployment benefits ran out. Paying rent, utilities, and other living expenses took
priority over paying their credit-card bills. (Tr. 30.)
In approximately January 2011, Applicant’s spouse began operating his own home
improvement business. Applicant stopped working as a school bus driver to become his
full-time  office  manager.  (GE  1;  Tr.  30-31.)  Her  spouse’s  work  was  sporadic,  and  his
business brought into their household less than $500 a week. (Tr. 35.) They continued to
live from paycheck to paycheck until late 2014 or early 2015, when her spouse took an
opportunity at construction work in the Caribbean. (Tr. 35.) With an increase in his income
from  that  work,  their  finances  improved  somewhat.  She  testified  that  she  went  on  an
income-based repayment plan for her student loans at that time. (Tr. 60.)
After  a  hurricane  destroyed  his  business  in  the  Caribbean  in  September  2017,
Applicant’ spouse moved back to the United States. He has been unemployed since then.
(Tr. 30-32, 51.) Applicant testified that he has dealt with untreated post-traumatic stress
because of living through the hurricane. (Tr. 51.)
Applicant earned no income as her spouse’s office manager from January 2011 to
September 2017. (Tr. 38.) After he lost his business, she was unemployed until December
2017, when she took a seasonal job as a tax preparer at $10 an hour. (GE 1; Tr. 39, 60.)
After the tax rush ended in May 2018, she was unemployed until February 2019, when
she began working for her current employer, a defense contractor. (GE 1; Tr. 41.)
In  November  2018,  Applicant  was  hired  by  a  defense  contractor  to  learn  the
structural draftsman trade. She had not yet started working for the company when, on
November 27, 2018, she completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF
86). In response to a financial record inquiry on the SF 86 concerning any delinquency
involving  enforcement,  Applicant  listed  three  credit-card  judgment  debts  for  $2,513,
$2,735, and $1,362, which she claimed were resolved in 2017 by monthly payments, and
a $1,207 credit-card judgment from January 2017 that she was repaying under a payment
arrangement. She cited unemployment as the reason for the credit-card delinquencies.
(GE 1.)
Available credit information shows that $2,513 was charged off in August 2013 on
a  retail charge  card obtained  in  June 2009. Last  activity on  the  account  was  in  March
2013. It was assigned for collection in April 2017. While she indicated on her SF 86 that
the debt was paid off in approximately December 2017, a letter from the collection entity
shows that she paid $888 on July 20, 2020, which settled the debt. (AE F.) The $2,735
debt had been deleted from Applicant’s credit report by December 2018. Similarly, while
she indicated that the debt was paid in December 2017, the February 2015 judgment debt
was not satisfied until July 2020. (AE E.) Apparently, automatic payments from her bank
account stopped without her knowledge. (Tr. 26-29.) The $1,362 debt was incurred on
another credit card obtained in June 2009. The debt was placed for collection in August
2014 after inactivity since March 2013. The $1,207 judgment was on a revolving charge
account opened with a retailer in August 2009. The account was in collection as of August
2014. (GE 3.) Applicant focused on satisfying her judgment debts first. (Tr. 48.)
As of December 29, 2018, Applicant had several outstanding delinquencies on her
credit record. The history of those accounts and repayment efforts, if any, are set forth in
the following table.

Applicant  had  additional  student  loans  taken  out  for  herself  or  her son  (Tr.  54),
which she consolidated in May 2017 into an $86,909 student loan, to be repaid at $160
per month. That consolidated loan was 150 days past due for $4,064 in December 2017.
With income from part-time seasonal work as a tax preparer in 2019, she made a $160
payment in July 2019, which she indicates removed the loan from default. (AEs A, G-I;
Tr. 43.)  She has made no payments on the student loan since then. (Tr. 43.) Available
credit reports show that she has not been required to make any payments on the federal
student loans since April 2020. (AEs G-I.)
On   January   16,  2019,   Applicant  had   a   telephone   interview   with   an   authorized
investigator  for  the   Office   of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  about  her  financial
delinquencies.  Applicant  volunteered   information   about  some   outstanding   delinquent
accounts  (her student  loans  and  the  credit-card debts in  SOR ¶¶  1.k,  1.l, 1.p,  and  1.o)
that she  had  mistakenly  not listed  on  her SF 86. She  was confronted  about the  other past-
due  debts on  her credit record and  recognized  some  of  them  (SOR ¶¶  1.f, 1.i, 1.n, 1.q-
1.r, and  1.u-1.v), although  she  believed  that some  of them  were duplicate  listings of  those
accounts reported  on  her SF 86. Applicant cited  unemployment and  the  downturn in the
economy  from  2008  to  2009  as the  causes of  her financial difficulties  and  stated  that she
planned to repay her debts once she started  working full time. (GE  4.)
After the interview, Applicant looked into her credit-card accounts and provided an
update  to  the  investigator  on  January  22,  2019.  She  reported  that  she  had  paid  two
judgment debts, which available credit information shows had been placed for collection
for $1,084 (account ending x3206) and $388 (account ending x8476). She indicated that
she  was  making  payments  on  the  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.l  (balance  $929),  1.k  (balance
$1,112), and 1.u (balance $1,253). Applicant had also been able to confirm her liability
for  the  nine  debts  in SOR  ¶¶  1.d,  1.i,  1.k, 1.n,  1.q-1.t,  and  1.v.  She  admitted  she  had
made no payments on those debts, but she planned to start making payments once she
had  a  steady  salary.  (GE  4.)  Applicant  started  her  employment  with  the  defense
contractor in February 2019 at $15.93 an hour. (Tr. 41, 57.) She also worked for the tax
service during tax season at $12 an hour. (Tr. 60.)
Except for the judgment debts, Applicant has not received any collection notices
from  her creditors in  a couple of  years. (Tr. 57.)  In  January 2020, Applicant  opened a
credit-card account with a $1,000 limit and charged $471. She missed one payment due
in December 2020 but caught up of the account in January 2021. As of April 2021, the
account was current with a balance of $318. Applicant has two other active credit-card
accounts  with  balances  of  $1,268 and $852. She has made monthly payments  on the
accounts since opening them in June 2017 and June 2018, respectively. (AEs G-I.)
In August 2020, Applicant was approved for an income-based repayment of her
eligible student loans. The loan servicer required her to make no payments. (AE B.) As
of  May  2021,  the  total  balance  of  Applicant’s  outstanding  student-loan  debt  on  loans
obtained for her education and her son’s education totaled about $210,959. (AE A.) Due
to the pandemic, Applicant is not required to make payments on her federal student loans
until September 2021. At that time, Applicant intends to apply for another income-based
repayment plan and then start paying what is required under that plan. (Tr. 18, 21, 41.)
She  does  not  presently  intend  to  pay  anything  toward  her  student  loans  if  she  is  not
required to do so unless she comes “into some money.” (Tr. 44.)
Applicant has received increases in her hourly wage since February 2019. Since
February 2021, her hourly wage has been $21. (Tr. 57.) After deductions, including for
taxes, her take-home pay is between $500 and $550 a week. (Tr. 31-32.) As of May 2021,
Applicant  had  not  managed  to  set  aside  any  money  to  repay  her  student  loans.  After
paying  their  monthly  living  expenses,  including  rent  of  $600  a  month,  she  has  little
discretionary income, if any. (Tr. 42, 57-58.) She testified that her spouse has a couple of
week-to-week job opportunities that “could be starting up mid to late summer.” (Tr. 51.)
Her  son,  who  works  for  the  same  defense  contractor,  will  contribute  financially  to  the
household if she “really need[s] something badly.” He owns his home. (Tr. 58.)
Applicant  consulted  with  an  attorney who  advised  her to file for bankruptcy,  but
she  was  concerned  about  the  impact  of  a  bankruptcy filing  on  her employment  with  a
defense contractor. Some people had told her that she would lose her clearance eligibility
if she filed a bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 44-45.)
