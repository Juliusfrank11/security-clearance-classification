The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of February 14, 2020, Applicant had not
filed his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.a).
When he responded to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation without explanation.
After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of
fact.
Applicant is a 32-year-old test analyst. He has worked for his current employer, a
defense contractor, since October 2017. His current duties do not require that he hold a
DOD security clearance, but having a clearance would allow him to perform work for his
employer on U.S. military installations. (GE 1; Tr. 23-24.)
Before this career opportunity, he was employed or self-employed as an automobile
repair technician. (GE 1; Tr. 20.) He has never married and has no children, but he has
been in a cohabitant relationship with his girlfriend since May 2018. (GE 1.)
After  graduating  from  high  school,  Applicant  worked  as  a  technician  for  a  car
dealership while also attending school to be an automotive technician. He graduated from
his  schooling  in  2008  and  left  the  employment  of  the  car  dealership  voluntarily  in
approximately  May  2009  to  work  for  an  independent  garage,  where  he  felt  he  could
improve his skills in the trade. Due to a decline in business at the garage, Applicant was
laid off in May 2012. (GE 1.)
Applicant collected unemployment from May 2012 to December 2012, when he
decided to start his own automobile repair shop. For income tax purposes, he was self-
employed until October 2016. (Tr. 20.) IRS publication 334, which provides tax guidance
for small businesses that use schedule C (sole proprietor), indicates that tax returns are to
be  filed  under  the  sole-proprietor’s  social  security  number  but  also  that  an  employer
identification number is required if either wages were paid to one or more employees, or
the business filed pension or excise tax returns. See www.irs.gov. Section 6017 of Title 26
of the United States Code provides that a tax return is required to be filed if net earnings
from self-employment are $400 or more. Applicant provided little detail about his income
and expenses while self-employed from December 2012 to October 2016, other than that
he struggled financially at times. In May 2016, he decided to move to a larger shop. He felt
he had outgrown his previous space and wanted to bring in a business partner. Over the
next few months, Applicant struggled to keep his business afloat. He was unable to find a
compatible person to share the space, and he closed his shop in October 2016. (GE 1.)
Applicant had “developed a proficient mechanical skillset,” but he lost interest in
working in the automotive repair industry. He was unemployed from October 2016 to May
2017 while deliberating his next career move and looking for employment in other fields of
interest to him. From May 2017 to December 2017, Applicant worked as a mechanic for a
limousine service at $23 an hour. His income met or exceeded the minimum required to file
income tax returns for tax year 2017. (Tr. 39-40.) He enjoyed working for the limousine
service, but left voluntarily for a career opportunity with his current employer. (GE 1.)
On January 19, 2019, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86). In response to a financial record inquiry into whether, in the last seven
years, he had failed to file or pay federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or
ordinance, Applicant reported that he had not filed his federal or state income tax returns or
paid taxes owed for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016. He stated with respect to each of
those tax years:
During the years of 2013-2016, I ran my own automotive business. At first I
tried to do my own taxes, but after struggling reached out to a professional.
These years have still not been finalized but are being worked on currently
with plans to [have] past taxes resolved in 2019. (GE 1.)
Applicant estimated on his SF 86 that he owed delinquent income taxes of $5,000
for each of the three tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016, but he also indicated that he had
partially paid his tax debts for tax years 2014 and 2015. He also reported on his SF 86 that
he had not yet filed his federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2017, for which he
expected refunds that he would not receive “due to [his] prior negligence.” He explained
that he had not filed his income tax returns for 2017 “because [he] was worried about doing
the taxes [himself] and creating an issue since [he] still had a business account open.” He
added that his delinquent returns for 2017 would be resolved in 2019. (GE 1.)
On May 8, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). With respect to his delinquent tax returns and
taxes owed, Applicant attributed his tax issues to being a first-time business owner and not
knowing how to properly prepare his returns. He stated that he retained the services of an
accountant in 2015 to prepare his tax returns. He explained that he had yet to file his tax
returns  for  tax  year  2017  because  he  was  waiting  to  hear  from  his  accountant.  He
expressed an intent to begin paying any past-due taxes in August 2019 after hearing from
his accountant. Applicant denied any possibility of recurrence because a professional was
now handing his tax issues. (GE 2.)
As of September 30, 2019, Applicant had not filed his federal or state income tax
returns or paid any outstanding taxes for tax years 2014 through 2018. He explained in
response to DOD interrogatories that he had not filed his federal and state tax returns
initially “due to not having employment and unstable income,” but that he was currently
working  with  a  tax  specialist  to  file  his  returns  for  those  tax  years.  He  hoped  to  have
“closure” by the end of 2019. (GE 3.)
At  his  hearing,  Applicant  explained  that  he  had  hired  an  accountant  in  2015  to
address  his  unfiled  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2013  through  2016.  (Tr.  37.)  With  the
assistance of the accountant, Applicant filed his federal and state income tax returns for
2013 late. (Tr. 25.) He acknowledged that he had not been diligent about ensuring that his
tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2016 be prepared in a timely fashion, although he
had provided the accountant with documentation when asked. (Tr. 30, 35.)
Applicant did not retain professional assistance to file his tax returns for tax years
2017 through 2019, and he allowed the tax-filing deadlines to pass without making any
effort to file his tax returns. He had taxes withheld from his employment earnings for those
tax years, but he feared the possible consequences to him because his returns for tax
years 2014 through 2016 had not been filed. He testified that he did not know what to do.
(Tr. 20-21.) He did not seek any professional advice about his filing obligations, to include
from the accountant handling his tax issues for tax years 2014 through 2016. (Tr. 37.)
The accountant handling Applicant’s income taxes for tax years 2014 through 2016
passed away sometime during the latter half of 2020. (Tr. 35.) Applicant had given that
accountant all the paperwork that he had regarding tax years 2014 through 2016, and so
he had  to  “start over.” (Tr. 29.) Aware that his unfiled tax returns were an issue for his
security  clearance  eligibility,  Applicant  retained  the  services  of  another  accountant  in
January 2021. This accountant made it clear to him that he had an obligation to file his
income tax returns for tax years 2017 through 2019, even though his tax returns for tax
years  2014  through  2016  had  not  been  filed.  (Tr.  38-39.)  With  the  assistance  of  this
accountant, Applicant filed his  federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2017
through 2020 in early March 2021. (AE B; Tr. 21, 25.) He requested IRS tax transcripts for
tax years 2014 through 2016 under his social security number, but they did not show the
information needed to file his tax returns for those tax years. (Tr. 22, 28.)
At his April 29, 2021 hearing, Applicant expressed his intention to request his tax
transcripts for tax years 2014 through 2016 under his employer identification number so
that he could file his delinquent tax returns. (Tr. 22, 28.) As of May 12, 2021, Applicant had
requested, but not yet received, the tax transcripts for those tax years. (AE C.) He intends
to file his income tax returns on time in the future. (Tr. 23.)
In March 2021, Applicant began a repayment plan to address $5,719 in past-due
state sales and use taxes from his business. (Tr. 31.) After a May 3, 2021 payment of
$169.25, his balance is $4,411. (AE D.) Applicant received a federal income tax refund of
$1,241 and a state income tax refund of $62 for tax year 2020. (AE A; Tr. 26.) He does not
believe that he owes any outstanding income taxes for tax years 2017 and 2018. (Tr. 27.)
