Applicant  is  a  47-year-old  manufacturing  engineer  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since September 2015. (Item 3) He seeks a security clearance in conjunction
with his current employment.
Applicant  received  his  high  school  diploma  in  May  1992,  and  was  awarded  a
bachelor’s  degree  in  August  1996.  Applicant  was  previously  married  from  December
2004 to April 2008, and that marriage ended by divorce. He remarried in January 2010.
Applicant has a six-year-old son, and a five-year-old stepson. (Item 3)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s  SOR lists  three allegations: (1)  that he failed  to file  his 2017 federal
income  tax  return;  (2)  that  he  failed  to  file  his  2016  federal  income  tax  return  until
November 2019; and  (3) that he owes the federal Government approximately $13,000
for tax year 2016. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.c (Item 1))
These  allegations  are  established  by  Applicant’s  October  24,  2018  SF-86;  his
November  26,  2020  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA)  Response  to
Interrogatories,  containing  his  April  9,  2019  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)
interview;  his  March  17,  2021  SOR  Answer  in  which  he  admitted  all  three  allegations;
and his April 3, 2021 credit report. (SOR Answer; Items 1 – 5)
Applicant  self-reported  that  he  had  not  filed  or  paid  his  2016  and  2017  federal
income taxes when he completed his October 24, 2018 SF-86. He claimed that he was
waiting  to  receive  $57,000  owed  to  him  from  a  contractor  following  a  home  building
dispute.  In  total,  he  estimated  that  he  owed  $25,000  in  federal  income  taxes,  adding
that he paid $1,000 for each year requesting filing extensions. (Item 3) Applicant further
disclosed that he was involved in a 2016 child custody modification proceeding, and in
2017 he was sued for failure to disclose information on a 2013 home sale. (Item 3)
During  his  April  9,  2019  OPM  interview,  Applicant  related  that  in  April  2016  he
contracted with a builder to build a $565,000 house. Per the contract, the house was to
be  completed  by  December  2016.  He  withdrew  $57,000  from  his  401k  as  a  down
payment  to  the  contractor  to  begin  construction  of  his  new  home.  Following  delays,
Applicant  hired  an  attorney  in  January  2017  to  sue  the  contractor  for  return  of  his
deposit. The contractor terminated the contract in August 2017. The matter was set for
arbitration in December 2019. (Item 4) Applicant inferred that this issue prevented  him
from filing his 2016 and 2017 federal income returns, and stated that he planned to use
his  settlement  from  the  lawsuit  to  pay  his  taxes.  (Item  4)  He  further  disclosed  that  he
had “received four or five letters from the IRS reminding him to file his taxes but did not
respond to  them.” Applicant claimed he was unsure what he owed, but intended to file
his 2018 Federal income tax return on time. (Item 4)
In  his November 26, 2020  Response to Interrogatories, Applicant claimed, “I did
not file for 2016 and 2017 due to issues with builder . . . . I was trying to find ways to
write  off  the  issues  we  were  having  with  them  and  get  our  money  back.”  (Item  4)
Applicant  claimed  that  he  submitted  his  2016  and  2017  tax  returns  together  late,  but
that the IRS had only received his 2016 return and was still processing it. (Item 4) He
stated  that  he  would  pay  his  2016  taxes  when  the  return  was  processed.  (Item  4)
Applicant’s  tax  transcripts  show  the  IRS  received  his  2016  return  in  February  2020.
(Item  4)  However,  in  November  2020,  the  IRS  requested  Applicant  provide  additional
verification  of  his  identity.  (Item  4)  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  would  need  to
contact the IRS to address the identity theft issue. (Item 4)
Applicant  further  explained  in  his  Response  to  Interrogatories  that  he  had
computer software problems with his 2017 income tax return, but that he would contact
a  tax  service  for  assistance.  He  stated  that  he  still  owed  the  IRS  “a  call.”  (Item  4)
Applicant’s tax  transcripts also reflect  that Applicant was assessed  penalties for failing
to file timely his 2018 and 2019 income tax returns and pay the amounts due. (Item 4)
He did not provide any additional information explaining the reason for these additional
delayed income tax returns.
In  his  SOR  Answer,  Applicant  discussed  the  lawsuits  he  was  involved  in  and
stated  that  he  had  withdrawn  401k funds  to  cover  his  attorney fees.  This  contradicted
Applicant’s previous statement to  the OPM investigator that he  had  withdrawn  funds to
invest  in  new  construction  of  his  home.  He  further  stated  that  the  litigation  settled  in
2019 and that he received his money back. He provided no evidence that any of  these
funds were used to resolve his tax debt. (Item 2)
Applicant claimed that the IRS had still not processed his 2016 income tax return,
but  did  not  detail  any  action  he  took  to  resolve  the  November  2020  IRS  inquiry
regarding the verification of his identity. Finally, Applicant admitted in his SOR Answer
that despite his previous statements that he would take corrective action, he had still not
filed his 2017 tax return. (Item 2) According to Applicant’s Personal Financial Statement,
he has a net monthly remainder of $2,283. (Item 5)
Department  Counsel’s  FORM  discussed  specific  shortcomings  of  Applicant’s
SOR answer, and emphasized long-standing DOHA case law concerning the necessity
for applicants to provide mitigating documentation and the seriousness of fulfilling one’s
obligations  to  file  timely  Federal  income  returns  and  pay  one’s  taxes.  Except  as
discussed  above,  Applicant’s  SOR  Answer  and  FORM  Response  contained  no
documentation that adequately addressed this requirement.
