Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 44 years old and works for a defense contractor as a security guard.
He was born in a foreign country in the Caribbean and entered the United States at age
12 with his family. In 2009 he naturalized as a U.S. citizen. He was granted a security
clearance the same year. He earned a Bachelor’s degree in 2012. He began working part
time “on  call” for his current employer in 2019 at a higher hourly pay rate than he has
earned in the past. With a security clearance, he would be able to work full time and earn
much more with overtime, which is readily available at his employer. He also works less
than full time as an armed security guard for another employer. He has been continuously
employed in the security field since 2008. Some of his jobs, however, have been part time
or paid poorly. He has never married. He has one child, age 14. (Tr. at 20-22, 25-27; GE
2 at 4.)
In his May 28, 2019 background interview, Applicant was confronted with a large
number of debts that were delinquent or in collection. He acknowledged the debts and
told the investigator that it was his intention to pay them. (GE 2 at 4-11.)
SOR Allegations
Paragraph 1, Guideline F - The SOR sets forth 18 allegations regarding Applicant’s
delinquent  debts,  ten  of  which  are  student  loans.  The  total  amount  of  Applicant’s
delinquent student loans is about $53,000. The total amount of the remaining eight debts
set forth in the SOR is about $23,000.
The details regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:
a.   Collection  account  $969.  This  debt  is  for  rental  charges  for  a  storage  unit.
Applicant moved to a rental consisting of a single room and had to put his property into
storage. He had other debts and stopped making payments to this creditor in 2019. He
entered into a $100 per month payment arrangement with the collection agency handling
this debt. He made his first payment in May 2021. After the hearing, he provided evidence
of a June 2021 payment in the amount of $50. This debt will be fully repaid in about eight
months. This debt is being resolved. (Tr. at 41-45; GE 5 at 1; AE J.)
b. Collection account  - $386. This credit-card debt is owed to a bank. Applicant
testified that he has paid the debt. He provided documentary evidence of his payment in
full. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 45-48; GE 3 at 14; GE 4 at 2; AE F.)
c.  Charged-off   account   -  $593.   Applicant  opened  this  credit-card  account  in
January  2018  and  defaulted  in  mid-2019.  He  is  presently  making  payments  on  the
account. He provided a document evidencing $50 payments every month since February
2021,  totaling  $293,  about  one-half  of  the  debt.  The  Government’s  March  2021  credit
report in the record (GE 5) reflects that Applicant had reduced the amount of the debt at
that time by $100. He also provided a statement from the creditor reflecting a remaining
balance of about $300. This debt will be fully repaid in about six months after the close of
the record. This debt is being resolved. (Tr. at 48-49; GE 3 at 7; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 3;
AE E.)
d.   Charged-off   account   -  $213.   Applicant  opened  this  jewelry  store  charge
account in 2017 and defaulted on the account in 2018. After the hearing, he entered into
a payment plan to repay this debt with six monthly installments of $35, totaling $213. He
also provided evidence that he made his first payment on June 16, 2021. This debt will
be  fully  repaid  in  about  five  months  after  the  close  of  the  record.  This  debt  is  being
resolved. (Tr. at 49-50; GE 3 at 7 15; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 3; AE G.)
e.  Charged-off   account   -  $3,315.   Applicant  opened  this  auto-loan  account  in
2017. He defaulted on the loan in 2020. Applicant testified  that he  is now “focused” on
repaying this debt because, aside from his student loans, it is one of his largest debts.
After the hearing, he made his first payment of $276.91, plus a service fee. This amount
represents the first of 12 monthly payments. This debt is being resolved. (Tr. at 50; GE
3 at 9; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 4; AE C.)
f.  Federal   student   loan  collection  accounts   f  ($11,559);   h  ($8,766);   j   ($3,268);   k
($3,157);   l  ($3,057);   m  ($2,924);   n   ($2,457);   and  o   ($2,124).   About  a  year  after  he
graduated  with  his Bachelor’s  degree,  Applicant  began repaying his student  loans.  He
was making automatic monthly payments of $150 out of his bank account. He changed
accounts and failed to notify the lender, so the payments stopped. The eight loans listed
in  the  SOR  allegations  noted  above  have  been  assigned  to  the  U.S.  Department  of
Education (DOE) for collection. In about 2017, the DOE or its agent contacted Applicant
and requested that he resume making payments. He can afford to pay these loans now
that he is working two part-time jobs. He has entered into a payment arrangement with
National Recoveries, Inc., acting on behalf of DOE, to start deducting payments again in
October 2021 under a rehabilitation plan. I note that due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, the
DOE has been providing temporary relief of student loans, including the suspension of
loan payments and collections of defaulted loans. On January 20, 2021, President Biden
extended  that  COVID-19  emergency  relief  to  September  30,  2021,  and  on  August  6,
2021, the pause was extended to January 31, 2022. As a result, Applicant is not obligated
to make any payments  until the new deadline. If  he receives  a  security  clearance and
becomes eligible to work full time with his sponsor, he will have more funds available to
pay  his  student  loans  debts  at  that  time.  These  debts  are  not  yet  resolved,  but  no
payments are due at this time and he has a plan to begin addressing these debts when
required to do so. I conclude this debt in favor of Applicant. (Tr. at 22, 32-41, 51; GE
3 at 3-11; GE 4 at 1-2; GE 5 at 4-6; AE B.) (See https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-
room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/pausing-federal-student-loan-payments/;
https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/coronavirus;
https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-administration-extends-student-loan-
pause-until-january-31-2022 . (Administrative Notice I)
g.  Federal student  loans  collection accounts  g  ($9,694);  and i  ($6,242).  Two
of Applicant’s ten student loan debts listed in the SOR have been assigned  for collection
to  Educational Credit Management Corp. (ECMC). Two  days after the  hearing, Applicant
entered   into   a   Loan   Rehabilitation   Agreement  with   ECMC to   rehabilitate   the   two   loans
DOE  has assigned  to  it. The  agreement requires Applicant to  pay  $273  per month  for nine
months to  “rehabilitate”  the  loans.  After that he  will enter  into  a  standard repayment plan.
Also,   ECMC  will  request  at  that  time   that  the   credit  reporting   agencies  note   that
Applicant’s two  student  loans are not  in  default.  As  noted  above,  the  new  deadline  for  the
expiration  of  the  student loan  payment moratorium  is now  January  31, 2022. These  debts
are not yet resolved,  but no  payments  are  due  at this time  and  he  has a  plan  to  begin
addressing   these   debts  when   required   to   do   so.   I   conclude   this   debt   in   favor  of
Applicant.  (AE A.)
p.  Charged-off   account   -  $16,296.  Applicant  opened  this  auto  loan  account  in
2012 and defaulted on the loan in 2017. He could no longer pay the loan, and he returned
the vehicle. He was unaware that he would have a large deficiency on the debt after the
repossession. He testified that he will resolve this debt through a payment plan once he
is able to work full-time with his clearance sponsor with a security clearance.  After the
hearing, he provided evidence of a payment plan to pay $413.15 per month and an initial
payment of $150. This debt is being resolved. (Tr. at 51-52; GE 3 at 3; AE D.)
q. Collection  account  - $824. Applicant believes this may have been a debt for
auto insurance. He testified that he will take care of that delinquent bill. After the hearing,
he made his initial payment of $50. He will repay this debt in full in about 16 months. This
debt is being resolved. (Tr. at 52-53; GE 3 at 14; AE I.)
r.  Collection  account   -  $354.   Applicant  admitted  that  he  once  had  cell  phone
service  with the original creditor on this account. He testified that he will look into why
they are claiming he is indebted to the service provider. After the hearing, Applicant made
a  payment  of  $176.67  and  provided  documentation  that  the  account  now  has  a  zero
balance. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 53; GE 3 at 15; AE K.)
Applicant pays $40 per week in child support. The amount is deducted from his
paycheck every week. He has no arrearage for unpaid child support. In the past, he has
been focused on paying his rent, child support, and utilities. He testified that he does not
earn a lot of money, and he pays the bills he can to meet his basic commitments. Now
that  he  has  some  additional  income  from  a  second  part-time  job,  he  is  focused  on
repaying his largest debts, which are his student loans and his unpaid auto loans. With a
security clearance, he can work full time with his sponsor and be eligible to work overtime.
He is presently working “on call” with that employer. He testified that:
“it is just  tough, you  know. I worry  how  I will live. I’m  on my  own. It’s just  - -
to  be honest with you  - - I’m very responsible. It is just certain things  I need
to take care of  here. I’ve got to do this. I’ve got to  do that. It’s just so  much.
He works about 32 hours per week at his primary job as an armed security guard and is
working one or two days a week “on call” at his clearance sponsor. He earns less than
$3,000 per month and lives in a state known for its high cost of living. He is careful with
his  spending,  but  he  does  not  have  a  written  budget.  He  has  not  received  any  credit
counseling. In the past, he has had financial problems when his hours were reduced or
his pay rate was insufficient, not because of any extended unemployment. (Tr. at 55-59.)
