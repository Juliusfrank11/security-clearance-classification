Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  48  years  old.  He  is  a  high  school  graduate  and  has  earned  some
college credits. He married in 2011 and has a 26-year-old stepchild. He has worked for
the same employer since 2005. His current annual salary is about $60,000. His wife is
employed  and  her  current  annual  salary  is  about  $72,000.  She  has  been  employed
steadily since 2010. Applicant has volunteered as a firefighter and emergency medical
technician  and  medical  director  for  ten  years.  He  has  also  served  on  the  Board  of
Directors for the fire department. Applicant also volunteered with the American Red Cross
as a storm shelter director during hurricanes. (GE 1; Transcript (Tr.) 18-20, 55, 54)
The SOR  alleges five debts totaling  approximately $27,438. Applicant attributes
his financial problems that occurred in about 2010 or 2011 to when he helped some family
members with medical expenses. He was unable to recall the amount.
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($12,188) was for a loan to purchase a vehicle in 2007. Due
to  an  illness  in the family in  about  2010 or 2011,  he  allocated funds  to help them and
failed to pay the loan. He attempted to refinance the loan, but due to the age of the vehicle
at the time, he was unable. The vehicle was voluntarily repossessed in about 2012. He
recently attempted to negotiate a settlement, but the creditor wanted $5,000 immediately,
and Applicant was unable to pay it. The debt is unresolved. (Tr. 37-41)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($7,453) is for a credit card that was opened about 2007.
Due  to  the medical issues  in  his family,  he defaulted on  the  account  in  about  2010 or
2011. Applicant testified he has not taken action to resolve this debt. (Tr. 41-43)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($1,270) is a collection account from 2018 owed for medical
services  that  Applicant  believed  were  covered  by  his  medical  savings  account.  The
amount  owed  exceeded  the  balance  in  the  medical  savings  account.  Applicant  was
contacted by a law firm representing the collector and an agreement was made in 2020
whereby  Applicant  would  make  payments  of  $100  a  month.  He  provided  an  account
summary of his payments. From March 2020, when the agreement began, to July 2021,
he failed to make seven monthly payments. A balance of approximately $600 remains to
be paid. (Tr. 28-31, 41-45, 51; AE A)
The  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.d  ($394)  is  a  collection  account.  Applicant  provided  a
document of a proposed payment arrangement to pay the creditor $49 a month beginning
in August 2021, with the final payment due in December 2021.  At the time of  hearing,
payments had not started. (Tr. 42-45 GE 2; AE C)
The  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  ($6,133)  is  a  judgment  from  2013.  This  was  for  a  loan
Applicant obtained for a sailboat that was repossessed during the time he experienced
financial hardship in 2010 and 2011. He stated in 2013, when the judgment was entered,
he began making monthly payments of $114 for ten months. He said that in 2013 he was
unable to contact the creditor. He said he was unable to locate the original creditor. He
did not provide any documents to substantiate any payments or attempts to resolve the
judgment. (Tr. 46-49)
Applicant has other delinquent debts on accounts that were opened in 2019 and
went  to  collection  in  May  2020  that  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  He  is  attempting  to
resolve them. He admitted that it was after his receipt of the SOR that he began to address
some of his delinquent debts. He plans to tackle the smaller debts first. He said his current
finances are fine, and he and his wife live within their means. They own 2020 and 2021
vehicles. His wife has about $6,000 in her savings account. It is not a joint account. He
does not have a savings account. He has about $6,000 in a pension plan. Applicant’s wife
handles the finances. He stated his wife has a budget, but he has not taken the initiative
to access it. He has not participated in financial counseling. (I have not considered any
derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR for disqualifying purposes. I may
consider such in my whole-person analysis, in mitigation, and when making a credibility
determination.) (Tr. 31-35, 49-66)
