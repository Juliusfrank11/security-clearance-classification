Applicant is a 32-year-old senior consultant, employed by a government contractor
since October 2014. He previously worked for another government contractor from July
2011 to September 2014. Applicant was born in 1989 in China, and entered the United
States in 1992. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2002.  He graduated from high
school in 2007 and attended university from September 2007 to May 2011, when he was
awarded  a  bachelor’s  degree.  Applicant  is  unmarried.  He  was  previously  denied  a
security clearance in 2010 by the U.S. Department of State based on drug involvement,
however  he  was  granted  a  DOD  security  clearance  and  sensitive  compartmented
information (SCI) eligibility in 2011 while working for a defense contractor. He was denied
SCI  eligibility  by  another  government  agency  in  2017 for  illegal  drug  use,  involvement
with prostitution, and falsifying a SCA.
The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant purchased and used marijuana
from June 2008 to June 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and from October 2015 to December 2015
(SOR ¶ 1.b); that he attempted to grow marijuana in 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.c); used cocaine from
October 2015 to December 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.d); and  Applicant’s  2015 drug involvement
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b – 1.d) occurred after being granted a DOD security clearance in 2011 (SOR
¶ 1.e).
The SOR also alleges under Guideline E that Applicant falsified his 2011 SCA by
failing to report his purchases and use of marijuana as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, above. (SOR
¶¶ 2.a and 2.b) SOR ¶ 2.c alleges Applicant twice engaged with a prostitute in November
2015.  SOR  ¶¶  2.d,  2.e,  and  2.f  allege  Applicant’s  failure  to  disclose  his  drug  use,
purchases, attempt to grow marijuana, and use while holding a security clearance in his
May 2016 SCA. SOR ¶¶ 2.g, 2.h, and 2.i allege Applicant failed to disclose his drug use,
including while holding a clearance, his purchases, and attempts to grow marijuana on
his August 2016 SCA. Finally, SOR ¶ 2.j alleges that Applicant failed to disclose drug use,
other  than  while  in  college  in  2009  (under  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and  1.d),  in  his  personal
subject interview with a DOD investigator on May 14, 2018. Applicant admitted all of the
SOR allegations with explanations.
Applicant admitted that he used marijuana from June 2008 to June 2010 while in
college, and from October 2015 to December 2015. He admitted to purchasing marijuana,
and using marijuana and cocaine at various times from October 2015 to December 2015,
and attempted to grow marijuana in 2015. He also admitted to twice engaging a prostitute
in Hong Kong while visiting in 2015. (Ans., Items 7, 8, and 9) Applicant stated that he first
applied for a civilian position with the U.S. Navy in 2010 and completed an SCA in May
2010, but he did not get the job. He noted in his 2010 SCA that he used and purchased
marijuana from June 2008 to May 2020, and that he used Concerta and Ritalin without a
prescription in 2008.
He again completed an SCA in February 2011. In his 2011 SCA, Applicant noted
that he was investigated in 2010 for a secret security clearance, but was denied by the
Department of State because they were “unhappy with my use of marijuana and did not
believe I have stopped for good. I have learned my lesson from this experience and regret
ever  using  marijuana.  I  have  not  smoked  for  over  half  a  year  now  and  don’t  plan  on
smoking again.” (Item 4) Despite the disclosure in his 2011 SCA about being denied a
security clearance due to drug involvement, he denied any involvement with illegal drugs
in the preceding seven years, including while holding a security clearance.
From July 2011 to September 2014, Applicant worked for a company he listed in
his 2016 SCA as a government contractor (Item 5) Applicant asserted that he first learned
in 2013 that he was previously granted a security clearance in 2011. A Joint Personnel
Adjudication System (JPAS) entry for Applicant shows that the Department of Navy CAF
granted Applicant eligibility for access to SCI in May 2011.  (Item 10) In October 2014,
Applicant  began  working  for  his  current  employer  and  clearance  sponsor.  (Item  5)  In
March 2015, Applicant signed a Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement. (Item
11)
Applicant  completed   two   additional  SCAs  in   May   and   August  2016.  In   both,   he
denied   previous  involvement  with   illegal  drugs,  including   while   holding   a   security
clearance, but he  did  note  that he  was denied  a  clearance  in  2011  “due  to  experimental
marijuana  use  in college.” (Items 5, 6)  In  October 2016, Applicant was interviewed  for a
polygraph  examination  by  another government agency. During  the  pre-test interview, he
admitted  his past drug  use  and  involvement with  prostitution  as alleged  in the  SOR.  (Item
7) In January 2017, that agency  denied  him  eligibility for access  to  SCI.
On  May 14, 2018, Applicant  was  interviewed  by a  Government  investigator. He
failed at that time to fully disclose his drug use history, other than while in college. In July
2019,  Applicant  was  again  interviewed  by  a  Government  investigator  in  an  enhanced
subject interview. In this interview, he disclosed his use of marijuana in 2014 to 2015 in
social settings with friends. He stated that he believed at the time, that his clearance was
“not active” since he was not working on government projects that required a clearance.
He also stated that smoking marijuana was not illegal, as it is legal in the city in which he
lived at the time, and where he currently lives. He also acknowledged using cocaine two
to  three  times  from  2014  to  2015,  but  admitted  after  being  confronted,  that  he  used
cocaine three-to-four times. He also acknowledged using marijuana from 2007 to 2010,
and purchasing it from 2009 to 2010. Applicant claimed that he did not report his drug
involvement in three SCAs due to being influenced by a Navy job recruiter not to admit to
drug use because it is viewed unfavorably. He followed that advice during subsequent
security applications.
In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  noted,  “[p]lease  accept  this  letter  as  my
signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement, substance misuse, illegal
sexual behavior,  and any other personal conduct involving questionable  judgment and
dishonesty”  with  the  understanding  that  future  infractions  would  serve  as  grounds  for
revocation of his clearance. (Ans.) He stated that events in 2015 occurred while he was
in  his  20s,  and  single,  and  did  he  “did  not  have  the  slightest  clue  how  important  a
government clearance really was.” He regrets the events that occurred in 2015, including
his use of marijuana, cocaine, and procurement of prostitution, and has since married,
bought a house, and lives responsibly. When he went to the 2016 interview, he says that
he  was  already  a  “changed  man.”  He  considers  his  activities  in  2015  to  be  “isolated
events” that will not be repeated. (Ans.)
