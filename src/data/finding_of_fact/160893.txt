Applicant,  age  53,  is  married  with  one  adult  child.  He  received  a  bachelor’s
degree in 1991 and a master’s degree is 1996. He received a Joint Professional Military
Education  (JPME)  phase  1  diploma  in  2005.  He  served  the  U.S  military  in  multiple
branches,  including  the  Navy  and  the  Army  National  Guard,  from  June  1986  through
June  2013,  when  he  transferred  to  the  retired  list  as  a  reservist  for  the  Army  National
Guard. A defense contractor offered him a position as a manufacturing engineer in May
2019, dependent on him being granted the security clearance for which his 2019 SCA is
pending.  He  previously maintained  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his  military
service. (Item 3; Item 8 at 1, 6, 7)
Applicant  worked  as  an  aviation  instructor  from  July  2013  through  November
2015.  He  worked  as  a  pilot  for  various  private  airlines  between  November  2015  and
February  2019  except  for  the  following  periods  of  unemployment  (which  followed  his
voluntary  resignations):  two  months  in  2016,  one  month  in  2018,  and  two  months  in
in  May  2019.  Applicant’s  current
early  2019  before  being  offered  the  position
employment status is not indicated in the record. (Item 3)
The  SOR  alleged  four  delinquent  debts  totaling  $30,624,  including  a  $25,338
credit-card debt, a $4,190 apartment-rental debt, and two medical debts totaling $1,101.
In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  denied  each  of  the  alleged  debts.  However,  the  debts
were confirmed by his credit reports dated July 2019 and January 2020. (Items 2, 4-6)
Applicant  fell  behind  in  his  payments  on  two  credit-card  accounts  in  2011,  with
approximate  balances  of  $2,000  and  $25,000.  He  attributed  these  delinquencies  to  a
period between 2008 and 2013 when his family exhausted all of their savings due to  a
combination of his father passing away, him being out of work, and the aftermath of the
economic  recession. He  resolved  the  $2,000  account  in  September  2016.  He  claimed
that  he  was  unsuccessful  in  his  initial  attempts  to  make  arrangements  to  pay  the
$25,000  account  (which  is  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a)  due  to  a  “material
disagreement” on the amount owed  and a dispute about some charges he attributed to
fraudulent  use.  He  did  not  specify  details  underlying  his  fraud  claim  or  the  amount  he
agreed that he owed. He also claimed that he consulted an attorney who advised that,
after  a  certain  number  of  years,  Applicant  could  not  be  held  liable  for  the  debt.  The
attorney warned that even one small payment could reset the statute of limitations clock
and  trigger  an  extension  of  the  time  that  the  creditor  could  pursue  him  legally  for  the
debt. Based on this advice, Applicant decided not to pay the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a.
He did not proffer any documents corroborating his claims. (Item 3 at 78-80; Item 8 at 7)
In  2013,  a  person  making  a  repair  damaged  a  sprinkler  head,  which  caused
flooding  in  Applicant’s  apartment.  The  flooding  damaged  the  carpet  and  its  padding,
upon which mold began to grow. The managing agent for the property owner refused to
repair the damages. After Applicant researched his options, he decided to default on his
lease, which he believed was an available legal option. He moved out of the apartment
in approximately July 2014. The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b is the amount that Applicant
was  charged  for  breaking  his  lease  and  for  the  carpet  and  padding  destroyed  by  the
flooding. Applicant is not willing to pay this debt because he does not believe that he is
legally  responsible  for  paying  it.  He  provided  pictures  of  his  then  recently  flooded
apartment, including three commercial dehumidifiers that were running. However, he did
not  proffer  evidence  of  actions  he  has  taken  to  resolve  the  issue  with  either  the
managing agent or the property owner. (Item 3 at 80-81; Item 8 at 7-8; Item 7)
Applicant is not sure to what expenses the medical debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c
and 1.d refer. He believes one of the debts could relate to a medical bill he incurred in
connection  with  a  2017  car  accident.  His  health  insurance  paid  most  of  the  expenses
related  to  the  accident  and  he  received  a  small  settlement  from  the  at-fault  driver’s
insurance company. However, he had one medical bill (the amount of which he did not
recall) that he was waiting to pay once he received the insurance settlement. When he
tried to pay that bill, he was told that the account had been sold to another creditor. He
never paid that bill because he was unable to locate the new creditor. He believes that
one of the two debts could be that account. In August 2019, he told a DOD investigator
that  he  would  try  to  research  the  two  medical  debts  and  pay  them  if  he  is  able  to
determine who to pay. Applicant did not proffer any documents corroborating his claims
about the medical bill he attributed to his 2017  car accident or any efforts he made  to
resolve either debt. (Item 8 at 8)
In  his  August  2019  security  clearance  interview,  Applicant  characterized  his
financial  situation  as  doing  great.  He  stated  that  he  was  willing  and  able  to  pay  his
financial obligations and any delinquent debts for which he believed he was responsible.
He was not planning on experiencing any financial difficulties in the future. At that point,
he managed his finances by paying cash or using his debit card for most purchases. He
maintained  one  active  credit  card,  but  tried  not  to  use  it.  He  stated  that  he  had  not
received any financial counseling. (Item 8 at 8)
In his February 2021 SOR answer, Applicant indicated that he had engaged the
services  of  a  law  firm  to  “remove  all  inaccurate  information” from  his  credit  report.  He
did  not  specify  any  further  details  concerning  that  arrangement,  including  whether  the
law firm  is providing him with any financial counseling or assisting him with paying his
debts. He provided a copy of the latest credit report (dated February 2021) that he had
received  from  the  law  firm.  Applicant  planned  to  “challenge  and  fight  inaccurate
information” on his credit reports. Without specifying  the debts to which he referred, he
asserted  that  the  “3  latest  hits”  were  “all  garbage”  and  “rightfully  gone;”  and  “[t]hat
company in my book has some culpability, and I am not going to try and unravel it now
8  years  later.”  He  did  not  provide  any  other  documents  corroborating  the  claims
asserted in his SOR answer. (Item 2; AE A)
None  of  the  SOR  debts  appeared  on  either  his  February  2021  or  April  2021
credit report. The April 2021 credit report revealed: 1) three credit-card accounts in good
standing with balances of  $2,660 (opened February 2021), $2,775 (opened November
2018), and $46 (opened April 2014), respectively; and 2) an automobile loan account in
good standing with a balance of $44,747 (opened March 2020). (Items 2, 4; AE A)
In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  could  not  promise  that  he
would  never experience  financial  difficulties again.  He feels fortunate  and  grateful that
he has maintained financial stability in light of the turbulent times facing the country. He
recognized  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance  and  fully  understands  the
concern. However, he also asserted: “In no case would any financial difficulty cause me
to betray my country.” (Item 2)
