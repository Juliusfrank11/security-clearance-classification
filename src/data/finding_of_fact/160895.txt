Applicant is a 59-year-old self-employed health-care recruiter. She has worked for
a federal contractor since March 2019. She married in September 1997 and has an adult
stepdaughter. She has lived in a home that she owns since October 2003. She earned a
bachelor’s degree in December 2001 and a master’s degree in December 2004. She has
never held a security clearance or been cleared for a public trust position.
Applicant’s financial  problems began  when  her business declined  and  she  used
credit cards to cover business expenses and to pay for uninsured medical expenses to
treat  a  knee  injury.  She  is  working  to  revive  her  business  while  working  for  a  federal
contractor and two other part-time jobs, one as a “backroom associate” for a clothing store
and the other as a licensed realtor. (FORM Item 8 at 4.)
In  Applicant’s  response  to  the  FORM,  she  submitted  evidence  that  on  June  7,
2021,  after  she  had  received  the  FORM,  she  had  resolved  four  credit-card  debts  not
alleged in the SOR. (AX A.) The SOR alleges ten delinquent debts totaling about $33,525,
of which about $21,847 is unresolved. The delinquent debts are reflected in credit reports
from  April  2021,  August  2020,  January  2020,  and  April  2019.  (FORM  Items  4-7.)  The
evidence concerning these debts is summarized below
SOR ¶  1.a:  line  of  credit charged off for $8,971.  This account was opened  in
June  1998  to  pay  the  costs of  Applicant’s business. It  became  delinquent in December
2017  when her business declined. (FORM Item 4 at 2.)  This debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.b:  credit-card  account  charged  off  for  $7,724.  This  account  was
opened in March 2013 and became delinquent in May 2018. (FORM Item 4 at 3.) This
debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c: credit-card account referred for collection of $5,417. This account
became delinquent in January 2018. In Applicant’s response to the FORM, she provided
documentation that this creditor had obtained a judgment for the amount of the debt and
was garnishing her pay. (AX H.) She stated that she was in the process of settling this
debt by agreeing to pay it in five installments of $700, but she provided no documentary
evidence  of  payments or a  payment  agreement.  However, the  April 2021  credit  report
reflects that Applicant is making payments under a partial-payment agreement and the
balance has been reduced to $4,871. (FORM Item 4 at 1.) The credit report indicates that
this debt is being resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.d:  credit-card  account  charged  off  for  $4,831.  This  account  was
opened in December 2012 and became delinquent in December 2018. (FORM Item 4 at
5.) This debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.e: collection account for $2,030. This collection account was opened
by a factoring company in June 2019. The April 2021 credit report reflects that the last
payment was in March 2021 and that the balance due is $707. (FORM Item 4 at 3-4.).
The credit report indicates that Applicant has been making payments on this debt, and it
is being resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.f:  credit-card  account  charged  off  for  $1,342.  This  account  was
opened in December 2012 and became delinquent in September 2014. The April 2021
credit report reflects that the last payment was in March 2021 and the balance has been
reduced to $1,117. (FORM Item 4 at 4.) In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she stated that
she  had  settled  this  debt  for  $450  and  was  making  monthly  $75  payments  on  it.  The
documentary  evidence  in  her  response  to  FORM  reflects  multiple  $75  payments  to
several creditors. The credit report indicates that this debt is being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.g: credit-card account charged off for $1,327. In Applicant’s response
to the FORM, she provided documentary evidence that this debt has been settled. (AX
B.)
SOR  ¶  1.h:  credit-card  account  charged  off  for  $1,279.  This  account  was
opened  in  September  2009  and  became  delinquent  in  December  2017.  In  Applicant’s
answer to the SOR, she stated that she had settled this debt for $450 and was making
monthly $75 payments on it. The documentary evidence in her response to FORM reflects
multiple $75 payments to several creditors. The April 2021 credit report reflects that the
last payment was in March 2021 and the balance was reduced to $1,054. (FORM Item 4
at 4.) The credit report indicates that this debt is being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.i: credit-card account charged off for $321. This account was opened
in  November  2009  and  became  delinquent  in  May  2018.  The  April  2021  credit  report
reflects that the last payment was in April 2018, the charged-off amount was $44, and the
account  was  closed.  (FORM  Item  4  at  3.)  In  Applicant’s  response  to  the  FORM,  she
admitted that this debt is not resolved because she has not determined which collection
agency  currently  holds  the  debt.  She  provided  no  evidence  that  she  has  attempted  to
contact the original creditor.
SOR ¶ 1.j: credit-union debt past due for $283, with a total balance of $2,448.
The April 2021 reflects that this account is current, with a balance of $1,807. (FORM Item
4 at 3; AX F.) The debt is resolved.
In  Applicant’s  response  to  the  FORM,  she  stated  that  after  she  makes  the  five
payments required by the payment agreement for the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g, she will
seek payment agreements for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, and then resolve
the other debts one at a time. (AX A.) She provided no evidence that she has contacted
the creditors or the collection agencies for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, or
1.i.
During  Applicant’s  interview  with  a  security  investigator,  she  admitted  that  her
financial  records  were  not  organized  and  that  she  was  unable  to  provide  detailed
information about her delinquent debts.  She told the investigator that she believed she
had  about  $40,000  in  debts,  of  which  about  $15,000  was  delinquent.  She  told  the
investigator that she had not received any financial counseling or any assistance from a
debt consolidation service. (FORM Item 8 at 5.)
The  April  2021  credit  report  reflects  that  the  payments  on  Applicant’s  home
mortgage loan are current. (FORM Item 4 at 6.) She has not provided any information
about her income, expenses, or assets.
