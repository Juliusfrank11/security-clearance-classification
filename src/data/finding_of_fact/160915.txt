Applicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR, except for SOR allegation ¶ 1.j.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  39-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX 1  at  page  7.)
He  has  been  employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  January  of  2006.  (GX  1  at
page 17.) He has held a security clearance since October of 2008. (GX 1 at page 53.)
He  is  not  married,  and  has  no  children.  (TR  at  page  14  lines  7~10.)  Applicant  has  a
Master’s degree. (TR at page 14 lines 16~21.)
Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
1.a., 1.b., 1.g.~1.j., and 2.c. Applicant used Marijuana “weekly” from 1995~2012,
and three times from 2012~2017. He also purchased Marijuana with varying frequency
from  1995~2012.  (TR  at  page  15  line  11  to  page  17  line  25,  and  Answer  at  page  2.)
Furthermore,  Applicant  used  and  purchased  Marijuana  after  completing  his  SCA  in
2007,  and  used  Marijuana  after  completing  his  SCA  in  2017,  while  employed  in  a
sensitive position, and after being granted a security clearance in 2008. (GX 3.)
1.c.,  1.d.,  1.g.~1.j.,  and  2.c.  Applicant  used  Psilocybin  Mushrooms  from
2002~2011. He also purchased Psilocybin Mushrooms four times. (TR at page 18 line 1
to page 19 line 20, and Answer at page 3.) Furthermore, Applicant used and purchased
Psilocybin Mushrooms after completing his SCA in 2007, while employed in a sensitive

1.e.,  1.f.,  1.g.~1.j.,  and  2.c.  Applicant  used  Cocaine  from  2001~2011.  He  also
purchased Cocaine. (TR at page 18 line 1 to page 19 line 20, and Answer at page 3.)
Furthermore, Applicant used and purchased Cocaine after completing his SCA in 2007,
while employed in a sensitive position, and after being granted a security clearance in

Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
2.a. Applicant admits that he falsified his March 2007 SCA, in answer to “Section
24:  Your  Use  of  Illegal  Drugs  and  Drug  Activity,”  when  he  failed  to  disclose  his
Psilocybin  Mushroom  usage,  his  Cocaine  usage,  and  his  post-2004  Marijuana  usage.
(TR  at  page  28  lines  3~25,  and  GX  3  at  pages  36~37.)  I  find  this  to  be  a  willful
falsification.
2.b.  Applicant  admits that he  falsified  his March  2017  SCA,  in answer to  “Section
23:   Illegal  Use   of  Drugs  or  Drug   Activity,”  when   he   failed   to   disclose   his   Psilocybin
Mushroom   usage,  his Cocaine   usage,  and   his  Marijuana   usage.  (TR  at  page   34   lines
5~12, and GX 3 at pages 43~44.) I find this to be  a willful falsification.
2.c. See  before mentioned  discussion, above, under Paragraph 1.
