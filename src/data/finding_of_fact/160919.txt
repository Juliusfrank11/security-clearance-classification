case  in  March  2005.  Under  Schedule  E,  Creditors  Holding  Unsecured  Priority  Claims,
the  petition  listed  $835  in  back  state  taxes  for  2000. The  petition  listed  claims  totaling

The SOR alleges that Applicants owes back federal ($8,990) and state ($1,692)
income  taxes  for  tax  year  2015,  and  that  he  has  six  delinquent  debts  totaling  about
$17,300. Applicant admitted that he owed all of the debts at one time, but he stated that
one  debt  was  paid,  and  he  was  in  the  process  of  settling  other  debts.  (Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 9; AE C)
Applicant  owed  federal  income  taxes  for  tax  years  2014  and  2015.  He  entered
into  an  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS  to  pay  $157  per  month,  starting  in  March
2018.  The  payments  for  2014  were  completed  in  June  2018,  and  then  the  payments
were  applied  to  2015.  He  made  every  $157  payment  from  March  2018  through
November  2019,  for  a  total  of  $3,297.  Documents  from  the  IRS  indicate  that  as  of
December  2019,  Applicant  owed  $8,990  for  tax  year  2015  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  Applicant
continued with the monthly payments through at least June 2020. The balance owed as
of  November  2020  was  $5,019.  He  changed  the  monthly  payment  in  August  2020  to
$50  per month.  He made  all the monthly payments  through  at  least  May 2021.  (Tr. at

Applicant  owed  state  taxes  for  tax  year  2015.  He  entered  into  an  installment
agreement  to  pay  $60  twice  per  month.  He  documented  13  payments  between  June
2019  and  December  2019,  leaving  a  balance  at  that  time  of  $1,690  (SOR  ¶  1.b).  He
made a $744 payment by credit card in June 2021 to pay the state taxes in full.  (Tr. at

SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  that  Applicant  owes  $777  for  an  unnamed  medical  debt  as
listed  on  a  December  2019  credit  report.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  owed  the  debt  at
one  time,  but  he  asserted  that  the  debt  was  paid. The  debt  is not  listed  on  any  credit
report after the October 2020 credit report. (Tr. at 36-37; Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 4, 5, 8; AE C)
Applicant engaged the services of a credit-counseling company in April 2021. He
enrolled three debts in the company’s debt-management program (DMP). He agreed to
pay the company $45, plus $45 per month. He also agreed to deposit with the company
$423 per month, which the company would use to pay his creditors. The DMP was later
amended to pay five creditors, including the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d. (GE 10; AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges a $4,518 charged-off auto loan. Credit reports from 2018 and
July 2019  list  the  balance  as  $4,685.  Applicant  made  payments  on  the  debt,  reducing
the  balance  to  $4,518  in  December  2019  and  $4,341  in  October  2020.  The  credit-
counseling  company  is  paying  the  creditor  $150  per  month  through  the  DMP.  The
balance was $4,203 in July 2021.  (Tr. at 37-38; Applicant’s response  to  SOR;  GE 2-5,

Credit  reports  from  2018  and  July  2019  list  a  $2,190  account  to  a  collection
company  on  behalf  of  a  telecommunications  company  (SOR  ¶  1.e).  The  debt  was
reported  by  all  three  credit  reporting  agencies;  it  was  assigned  to  collection  in
December 2016; and the date of last activity was August 2018. Applicant  asserted that
the debt was paid. The debt is not listed on any credit report after the  July 2019 credit
report. (Tr. at 38; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5, 8; AE C)
The  creditor  for  the  $7,592  delinquent  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.f  obtained  a
$7,650  judgment  against  Applicant  in  October  2014.  The  same  law  firm  represented
another creditor who  obtained  a $5,782  judgment  against  Applicant  in  July 2015. This
judgment was not alleged in the SOR as Applicant satisfied the judgment in December
2018. (Tr. at 47-48; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5, 8; AE C)
Applicant agreed to pay $500 per month for 15 months starting in January 2019,
followed by a last payment of $150 in April 2020  to pay the $7,650 judgment. The  law
firm notified the court on June 1, 2020, that the judgment was satisfied. The judgment
was apparently paid by garnishment. (Tr. at 39-41; GE 8; AE C)
Applicant  agreed  to  pay  $27  per  month  starting  in  December  2020  to  pay  the
$590 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g. The debt was reported by TransUnion and Experian on
the August 2018 credit report. It was reported as assigned in June 2016, with a date of
last activity of August 2018. Applicant asserted that the debt was paid. The debt is not
listed on any credit report after 2018. (Tr. at 43; Applicant’s response  to  SOR; GE 2-5,

TransUnion on the August 2018 credit report. It was reported as assigned in July 2016,
with  a  date  of  last  activity  of  August  2018.  Applicant  asserted  that  the  debt  was  paid.
The  debt  is  not  listed  on  any  subsequent  credit  report.  (Tr.  at  41-42;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2-5, 8; AE C)
Applicant  paid  other  debts  that  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  He  received
financial counseling through the credit-counseling company. He stated that he planned
to continue paying his debts until his financial issues are resolved. (Tr. at 46-49; GE 2-5,
8, 10; AE C)
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  periods  of  unemployment  and
underemployment,  and  separation  from  his  wife  before  they  reconciled.  He  was
terminated from a job in 2014 after he failed a drug test when he returned to work from
long-term disability in July 2014. He smoked marijuana while on disability. He asserted
that he has not used marijuana since 2014. (Tr. at 27; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE
1, 7; AE C)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
June  2018.  He  reported  significant  financial  problems,  including  his  back  federal  and
state  income  tax  debt.  He  reported  a  November  2017  driving  while  intoxicated  (DWI)
offense.1  He  also  reported  that  in 2014,  he  was  “[t]erminated  after returning  from  long
term disability.” He did not state the reason for the termination, and he did not report his
2014 marijuana use under the drug-use question. (GE 1)
Applicant discussed his DWI and marijuana use during his background interview
in  April  2019.  He  asserted  that  he  only  had  one  beer  while  with  his  family  on
Thanksgiving. That evening, several hours after his one beer, he drove to get fast food
for his wife, and he was stopped for not having his lights on. He stated that he passed
the field sobriety test, but his blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was .09%. He stated he
was  adversely  affected  financially because  he  had  to  hire  a  lawyer.  He  stated  that  he
paid  citations  for  not  having  his  lights  on  and  issues  with  his  registration,  but  he  was
found not guilty of DWI. (GE 7)
Applicant also discussed his marijuana use with the investigator.  He stated that
he used marijuana once or twice while in high school, and again in January 2014 while
he was out on disability. He stated that he did not think he would have a problem with
the drug test, because the test  was in July 2014, months after he used marijuana. He
asserted that he has not used marijuana since January 2014. (Tr. at 27, 30-31; GE 7)
Applicant denied  intentionally  providing  false information  about his marijuana  use
on  the  SF 86.  He stated  that  he  thought  he  reported  the  marijuana  use. He stated  that
he  completed  the SF 86  on the  computer, and  it  was kicked  back  about  three  times,  and
he  did  not notice  that  it  was missing  the  information  about his marijuana  use. (Tr. at 24-
26; Applicant’s response to  SOR;  AE C)
