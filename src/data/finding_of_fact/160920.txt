In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c,
1.f,  and  1.k-1.s.  She  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.d,  1.e,  and  1.g-1.j.  Her
admissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 29-year-old pipefitter employed by a defense contractor since April
2018. She married in January 2015 and divorced in June 2018. She has a 14-year-old
son from a previous relationship who lives with her. She received an associate’s degree
in April 2015. She has never held a security clearance.
The SOR alleges 19 delinquent debts that are reflected in credit reports from June
2021  (GX  2)  and  February  2019  (GX  3).  The  evidence  regarding  these  debts  is
summarized below.
SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c:  debts  to  the  U.S.  Government  for  educational  benefits,
placed  for  collection  of  $13,303;  $1,562;  and  $15,248.  These  debts  were  incurred
between  August  2015  and  October  2016,  when  Applicant  used  her  husband’s  military
educational benefits to attend college. They became delinquent when her husband did
not complete the military service required to qualify for the benefits, and the Department
of Veterans Affairs (VA) initiated action to recoup the benefits. The record does not reflect
whether  her  husband’s  premature  termination  of  military  service  was  voluntary  or
involuntary. A notification of the overpayment was sent in December 2016 to an address
where  Applicant  no  longer  resided.  She  learned  about  the  overpayment  when  her  tax
refund  for  tax  year  2018  was  diverted  to  repay  the  overpayment.  She  appealed  the
decision in December 2019, but her appeal was denied. The record does not reflect why
it was denied. The case was closed and is reflected in VA records as “unresolved” as of
June 21, 2021 (AX A.) Her pay was garnished for $200 per week from January 2019 until
February  or  March  2019,  when  the  garnishment  was  stopped  because  of  the  COVID
pandemic. She testified that she has continued  to dispute the debts, but she has been
told by the VA that she must set up a payment plan in September 2021. (Tr. 19-22.) The
record  does  not  reflect  whether  any  attempt  was  made  to  collect  the  debts  from
Applicant’s husband. She testified that she has been in contact with him, but she is not
confident that he will help her resolve them. (Tr. 26.) The debts have not been resolved,
but they are not yet delinquent because the deadline for establishing a payment plan has
not passed.
SOR ¶ 1.d: cellphone bill placed for collection of $446. This debt was referred
for  collection  in  September 2017.  Applicant  paid  it  in  in  August  2019.  (AX  C.)  It  is  not
reflected in the June 2021 credit report. (GX 2.)
SOR ¶ 1.e: cellphone bill placed for collection of $121. This debt was referred
for collection in February 2016. Applicant testified that she paid this debt. (Tr. 23.)  She
did not submit any legible documentation to corroborate her testimony.
SOR ¶ 1.f: delinquent medical bill for $169. Applicant admitted this debt and it
is reflected in the June 2021 credit report (GX 2 at 1.) She testified that she would pay it
promptly. (Tr. 24.) In her August 10, 2021 email, she stated that the debt was paid, but
she did not submit legible documentation to corroborate her testimony.
SOR  ¶¶  1.g-1.j:  delinquent  medical  bills  for  $368,  $450,  $480,  and  $196.
Applicant denied these debts on the ground that they had been paid. At the hearing, she
testified that she believed the debts were paid because they were no longer reflected on
her credit report. (Tr. 24.) She did not submit any legible documentation showing that the
debts were resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.k: delinquent tuition bill placed for collection of $3,390. This debt was
incurred  when  Applicant  attended  college  courses,  using  her  husband’s  educational
benefits. When her husband did not complete the military service required to qualify for
the  benefits,  the  VA  refused  to  pay  Applicant’s  tuition,  and  the  educational  institution
referred the amount of tuition for collection. Applicant contested the VA decision for the
same reasons as the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c. The debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.l-1.s:  delinquent  student  loans  totaling  $31,756.  These  debts  were
incurred before Applicant was married and before the educational debts alleged in SOR
¶¶ 1.a-1.c were incurred. She testified that the payments were due in about October 2015,
and her pay was garnished to pay them. She testified that she set up a payment plan in
2018 and made monthly payments until March 2020, when student loan payments were
deferred because of COVID-19. (Tr. 26-27.) She did not provide any documentation to
corroborate her testimony about a payment plan or payments made under the plan.
Applicant earns about $60,000 per year. (Tr. 14.) She testified that she does not
receive child support from the father of her son because the father is disabled (Tr. 36.)
She has been enrolled in a credit-counseling program provided by her employer for a “few
years,” and has been able to pay off some delinquent debts. She has also opened some
new accounts. The June 2021 credit report reflects a secured 12-month loan of $1,000
opened  in  January  2021,  with  monthly  $84  payments  which  are  current;  a  $15,000
unsecured  loan  opened  in  December  2020,  with  monthly  $363  payments  which  are
current;  and  a  $13,000  car loan,  opened  in March  2020,  with  monthly $240  payments
which are current. (GX 2 at 2-33; Tr. 30-32.)
These new financial obligations have mixed significance. On one hand, they show
that Applicant has improved her credit rating to the extent that she was able to obtain the
loans, and they show a limited pattern of financial responsibility. On the other hand, they
raise questions about her ability to resolve the debts alleged in  the SOR, because she
has  incurred  substantial  new  debts  before  the  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  have  been
resolved.
For about two years, Applicant has been helping her mother financially. She initially
was giving her mother about $50 per month, but she has increased that amount to about
$300 per month after her mother lost her job. (Tr. 33.)
