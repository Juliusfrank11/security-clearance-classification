Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  33-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  2019.  (TR  at  page  15  line  22  to  page  16
line 9, and GX 1 at page 7.) This is his first time applying for a security clearance. (TR at
page  16  lines  12~18.)  He  is  unmarried,  and  has  two  children.  (TR  at  page  18  lines
13~23.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a. Applicant admits that he untimely filed his Federal income tax returns for tax
years 2011~2013 and 2015~2017. He mistakenly thought that as he had no income for
the years in question, he was not required to file returns. (TR at page 24 line 14 to page
26 line 15.) He has since filed for those tax years as evidenced by tax documentation.
(AppX A.)
1.b.  Applicant  admits that he  untimely filed his state  income  tax returns for tax
years 2011~2013 and 2015~2017. He mistakenly thought that as he had no income for
the years in question, he was not required to file returns. (TR at page 26 line 16 to page
27 line 20.) He has since filed for those tax years as evidenced by tax documentation.
(AppX D.)
1.c. Applicant is making monthly payments of $679 in child support; and as such,
has reduced his past-due amount to $330, as evidenced by documentation. (TR at page
23 line 21 to page 24 line 13, and AppXs B and C.)
Guideline E - Personal Conduct
2.a. In answer to “Section 26 – Financial Record - Taxes In the last (7) seven
years,”  Applicant  admits  that  he  failed  to  disclose  the  delinquent  tax  returns  noted
above.  In  his  Answer  he  averred  that  it  was  not  intentional,  and  at  his  hearing  he
averred  it  was  a  simple  “mistake.”  (TR  at  page  28  lines  1~25,  and  Answer.)  When
offered  an  opportunity  to  submit  documentation  in  support  of  his  credibility,  Applicant
submitted nothing in this regard. (TR at page 29 lines 16~21.) This allegation is found
against Applicant.
