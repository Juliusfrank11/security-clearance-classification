In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted (with comments and explanations)
the financial allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c (owing one creditor for three accounts in
collection for  $22,226 (SOR  ¶  1.a);  $3,941  (SOR  ¶  1.b);  and  $7,240  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  His
SOR  admissions  and  those  at  his  hearing  are  incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.
After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings
of fact:
Applicant is 36  years old.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in 2001, and  received  a
bachelor’s degree  in 2007. He has never been  married  and  has no  children. This is his
first security  clearance  application.
Applicant’s work history in his 2019 SCA indicates he worked as a pizza delivery
driver  between  June  2008  and  November  2011.  He  then  worked  in  different  positions
for  a  home  inspection  company  between  2009  and  2018.  He  started  working  as  a
materials handler for his current employer and clearance sponsor, a federal contractor,
in  December  2018.  He  also  continued working for the home  inspection  company on  a
part-time basis.
Applicant  makes  between  $65,000  and  $70,000  a  year.  About  $10,000  a  year
comes from his part-time  job,  and  $55,000  to  $60,000  a  year  comes from his  position
with a federal contractor. (Tr. 62-63) After deductions, his net salary or take-home pay is
about  $2,318.  His  expenses,  including  groceries,  utilities,  car  and  medical,  and
miscellaneous  expenses  amount  to  about  $1,467.  His  mortgage  is  $642  a  month.
Applicant  believes  that  he  is  currently  financially  stable.  His  income  allows  him  to  pay
his living expenses and debts. (Tr. 38-41)
In  response  to  Section  26  (Financial  Record)  of  his  2019  SCA,  Applicant
disclosed the three accounts alleged in the SOR and two additional accounts that were
not alleged. One was a credit card account for $3,160 that he failed to pay. The creditor
issued  him  an  IRS  Form  1099-C,  cancellation  of  debt,  and  he  reported  it  in  his  2014
income  tax  return.  The  second  account  was  for  a  2013  loan  for  $7,000  to  install
windows  in  his  house  that  became  delinquent  for  lack  of  payments.  Applicant  averred
he  believe  the  debt was also  cancelled  because  it indicated  a  “0”  balance  in his credit
report, and the creditor did not attempt to collect.
Applicant testified that before he received the SOR, he retained the services of a
credit-repair  company  seeking  assistance  to  resolve  his  delinquent  accounts.  The
credit-repair company advised him not to repay the three delinquent accounts alleged in
the SOR and the $7,000 loan, because they were beyond the statute of limitations and
uncollectable by legal means. Applicant followed the credit-repair company’s advice and
ignored his delinquent debts. After receiving the SOR, Applicant realized he was given
bad  advice  for  purposes  of  receiving  access  to  classified  information.  He  hired  an
attorney  to  help  him  negotiate  settlements  with  his  creditors  and  to  address  the  SOR
concerns.
Applicant testified  that his financial problems were caused by his alcohol abuse
between 2002 and 2014. He was drinking too much alcohol too often. He was hungover
most  mornings  and  could  not  accomplish  his goals  at  work.  Because  he  was  drinking
too often, he was spending beyond his financial means and accumulated large amounts
of credit card debt. His utilities were shut off for nonpayment, and all of his credit cards
were closed for being delinquent. (GE 1, Section 24 (Alcohol))
In  2014,  after his  second  driving-while-intoxicated  conviction,  Applicant  stopped
consuming  alcohol.  He  successfully  attended  alcohol  counseling  between  2014  and
2018. During the same period, he also attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings.
He has continued to attend AA meetings to present. As part of the AA program, he has
a  sponsor  with  whom  he  maintains  contact,  and  they  follow  the  12  step  rehabilitation
process.  During  the  pandemic,  his  AA  attendance  has  been  reduced  to  two  times  a
month, but he believes participating in AA has been helpful to him, and he would like to
increase  his  attendance.  Applicant  credibly  testified  that  he  has  been  abstinent  since
2014.
In  November  2020,  Applicant  contacted  the  creditor  holding  the  three  accounts
alleged  in  the  SOR.  The  bank  agreed  to  settle  the  accounts  for  less  than  owed:  the
$22,226 account was settled for $7,800; the $3,941 account was settled for $1,400; and
the  $7,240  account  was  settled  for  $2,555.  In  April  2021,  Applicant  paid  in  full  all  the
settled  accounts.  (AE  A  –  D,  and  I  –  L) With  his  grandfather’s  financial  help  (a  gift  of
about  $100,000) and by refinancing the  home he  inherited from his parents, Applicant
was  able  to  resolve  his  delinquent  debt,  except  for  a  $7,000  debt  not  alleged  in  the
SOR.
Applicant  participated  in  a  financial  counseling  course  in  December  2020,  and
testified  he  is  following  a  budget.  He  noted  that  he  has  not  acquired  any  additional
delinquent debts since 2014. He believes that all of his financial problems were caused
by his alcohol abuse. He has learned a hard lesson as a result of his financial problems
and  the  clearance  process.  He  now  knows  that  he  has  to  maintain  financial
responsibility to be eligible for a clearance and to retain his job. He promised to maintain
financial  responsibility  in  the  future.  He  believes  that  as  long  as  he  maintains  his
sobriety, he will be able to maintain his financial responsibility and will not be a security
risk.
Applicant  submitted  numerous  reference  letters  from  his  direct  manager,
colleagues,  friends,  and  family  members.  His  references  lauded  his  work  ethic,
personality, and ability to work under pressure. He is considered to be an asset to his
company,  and  he  is  professional,  trustworthy,  dependable,  and  committed  to  doing  a
good job. His references endorsed his eligibility for a clearance.
