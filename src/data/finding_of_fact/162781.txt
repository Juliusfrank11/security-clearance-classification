Applicant  is  a  31-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  where  he  has
worked since 2019. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 2008 until he was
honorably discharged in August 2016. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he
has  apparently  held,  with  a  short  break,  since  he  was  in  the  military.  He  is  attending
college on the GI Bill. He married in 2015. He and his wife separated in 2019  and are
pending divorce.  He  has  no  children, but he has  three  stepchildren  who  live  with  their
mother. (Transcript (Tr.) at 16-21; GE 1; AE B, C)
The  SOR  alleges  12  delinquent  debts,  with  balances  totaling  about  $58,000.
Applicant admitted to owing all the debts, but the $14,222 defaulted auto loan alleged in
SOR  ¶  1.b  is  being  paid  by  garnishment  of  his  wages  after  a  judgment  was  awarded
against  him.  His  pay  statement for the  period  October  17,  2020,  to  October  23,  2020,
shows  that  $300  was  garnished  that  pay  period,  and  $8,557  was  garnished  year-to-
date.  The  balance  as  reported  on  a  January  2021  credit  report  had  been  reduced  to
$9,621. (Tr. at 15, 34-35; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A, D)
financial  problems
Applicant  attributed  his
to  unemployment  and
underemployment after his discharge from the military. However, several debts became
delinquent before his discharge from the military and others became delinquent after he
started  his  current  job.  He  was  off  work  from  the  time  he  went  on  terminal  leave  until
about a month after his discharge. He worked from September 2016 to December 2017
in  a  low-paying  job.  He  worked  from  December  2017  for  another  defense  contractor
until he went to work for his current employer in April 2019. (Tr. at 14, 21-24, 27, 33-34;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-5)
With  the  exception  of  the  garnishment,  Applicant  has  not  made  any  payments
toward the debts alleged in the SOR. He stated that he was concentrating on paying the
garnishment  and  the  loan  for  his  current  car.  He  receives  about  $1,360  per  month  in
disability pay from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and about $1,800 per month
in housing allowance as part of his GI Bill. He owes the IRS about $4,500 for the past
two  tax  years,  and  about  $100  in  state  income  taxes.  He  has  not  received  financial
counseling. (Tr. at 15, 25-28, 33-39; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE D)
Applicant admitted that letting his finances suffer “was just kind of a careless and
irresponsible thing to do.” His parents immigrated to the United States. He stated that as
a  first-generation  American,  he  did  not  learn  the  value  of  credit  when  he  was  growing
up. (Tr. at 41; GE 1)
