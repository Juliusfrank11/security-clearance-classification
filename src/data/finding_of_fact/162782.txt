Applicant is 34 years old. He is married, and has no children. (Item 5 at pages 5
and 27.)
1.a.   and  1.b.   Applicant  admits that he failed to file  his federal and state  income
tax returns for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2018. Applicant avers that he has submitted
the returns in question to a tax preparer, bur has submitted little else. These allegations
are found against applicant.
1.c.  Applicant admits that he owes a past-due tax debt to his state in the amount
of about $650, but has submitted nothing further in this regard. This allegation is found
against Applicant.
1.d.   and  1.e.  Applicant  denies that he owes over $19,000  in student  loans, and
this  averment  is  supported  by  the  holder  of  these  student  loans.  (AppXs  B  and  C  at
page 3.) These allegations are found for Applicant.
1.f.  Applicant  admits  that  he  owes  a  past-due  debt  to  a  bank  in  the  amount  of
about $22,400. He submitted documentation showing Applicant has recently made two
payments  totaling  $100,  towards  this  rather  substantial  debt.  (AppXs  A,  C  at  page  2,
and D at page 1.) This is too little too late; and as such, this allegation is found against
Applicant.
1.g.  Applicant admits that he owes a past-due debt for a wireless phone service
in  the  amount  of  about  $144;  and  has  submitted  documentation  showing  he  has
recently paid $55 towards this debt and has a credit of $2.31 due him, with a “$.00” due.
(AppX C at page 1.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.h.  Applicant  denies  that  he  owes  Creditor  G  a  past-due  medical  debt  in  the
amount of about $334. As this past-due debt appears on the Government’s April 2017
credit report, this allegation is found against Applicant. (GX 5 at page 15.)
1.i. Applicant admits that he owes a past-due debt to Creditor I in the amount of
about  $207,  but  has  submitted  nothing  further  in  this  regard.  This  allegation  is  found
against Applicant.
1.j.  Applicant  denies  that  he  owes  Creditor  J  a  past-due  medical  debt  in  the
amount of about $150. As this past-due  debt appears on  the  Government’s April 2017
credit report, this allegation is found against Applicant. (GX 5 at page 16.)
