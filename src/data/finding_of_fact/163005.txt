Applicant is a 68-year-old operations research analyst who has worked in the same
positon  since  January  2019.  For  a  previous  employer,  he  gained  about  a  decade  of
experience in that same area. Applicant has earned a bachelor’s degree in mathematics
and  a  master’s  degree  in  operations  research.  Applicant  has  maintained  a  security
clearance since 1974. He was honorably discharged from the United States military in the
1990s after 21 years of service. Divorced, he has one grown child.
In  2007,  Applicant’s  then-current  wife  opened  a  restaurant.  (Tr.  18)  She  had
previously gained experience in the catering business and was active in the hospitality
ministry at her church, but she had no prior experience as a restauranteur. Applicant often
helped with the restaurant after his regular work day. An accountant was hired to file the
business’ tax returns, as well as the wife’s personal taxes. (Tr. 20) From the beginning,
the restaurant operated at a loss for various reasons. (Tr. 20-21) This continued until at
least 2013. Meanwhile, Applicant tapped into his savings and retirement account to help
the business. (Tr. 23) He now estimates that he lost about $200,000 of personal funds on
the venture.
In 2014, the restaurant was closed, following the marital separation of Applicant
and his now-former spouse. As a result, Applicant was paying for both his home and a
separate residence for his estranged wife. Around that time, the accountant informed the
couple  that  there  were  insufficient  receipts  and  documents  to  permit  the  filing  of  tax
returns  related  to  the  business.  This  started  a  “snowball  effect”  in  the  late  filing  of  tax
returns  for  both  the  business  and  the  couple.  (Tr.  24)  Ultimately,  the  restaurant’s  and
Applicant’s 2013 federal tax return  would not be filed until 2020, after more documents
were discovered in 2014 and thereafter. (Tr. 27)
The   couple   got  the   help   of   another  tax   preparer  in   late   2018   or  early   2019   to
complete  their  individual tax  returns. Applicant testified  that the  new  preparer filed  their
individual  tax   returns  for  tax   years  2013   through   2019.  (Tr.  28,  34-36;  Exs.  B,  I-K)  In
addition,  Applicant’s  tax   year  2020   tax  returns  were   filed.  In   the   end,  Applicant  owed
approximately  $20,000  for tax  years 2019  and  2020, including  interest and  penalties.  (Tr.
33)  He  attributes some  of  this sum  to  the  fact he  cannot take  an  exemption  for either his
ex-wife  or his grandchild, although  he  provides them  with  financial support. He  has filed
to  satisfy  this sum  through  instalment payments  over a  60-month  period. (Tr. 29-30, 41,
45; Ex. B)  To  date, one  payment has been  made. (Tr. 41) His state  taxes have  also  been
filed.  (Tr.  37,  41-42,  46-47;  Exs.   D,   F,   N)   He   has  been   in   repayment  with   the   state
regarding   past-due   sums  since   2020.  (Tr.  48)  He   has  tried   his  best  to   respond   to   all
queries he has received regarding his taxes despite having moved at least twice in recent
years. (Tr. 43)
In   the   interim,  in  2017,  Applicant’s  daughter  passed  away,  leaving  a  grandchild
who   was  ultimately   cared   for  by   Applicant’s  estranged   spouse.  Soon   thereafter,   an
amicable  divorce  was executed. Applicant continues to  support his ex-wife  financially. (Tr.
25) This amounts to  about $2,000  a  month  to  help  pay for her car,  rent,  and  support of
their grandchild.  (Tr. 26, 60)  He  is not subject  to  court-ordered  alimony. During  the  recent
pandemic, he  has occasionally  helped  his son  compensate  for reduced  wages by  giving
him   $500-$600   a   month.  (Tr.  61-62)  At  the   end   of   each   month,   Applicant  has  a   net
remainder of  about $1,000  to  $2,000. He  also has a  retirement account with a  balance  of
approximately  $60,000. (Tr. 63) He  recently  increased  his tax  withholding  through  payroll.
(Tr. 65-65)
In sum, Applicant earns a salary from his employer of approximately $170,000 a
year,  has  a  military  retirement  package  of  about  $50,000  a  year,  and  receives  about
$30,000 a year from Social Security. (Tr. 29; Ex. B) He rents his home. Other than the
tax issues noted above, the following delinquent debts are reflected in the SOR:
1.a – Charged-off account ($72,549) – Status unknown - This account is related to
a  secondary  mortgage.  It  was  for  an  equity  line  of  credit  from  Applicant’s  primary
residence, which was initially purchased in 2003. (Tr. 49) The line of credit was created
before Applicant’s wife opened her restaurant. The line of credit was used in about 2005
or 2006 to pay off credit cards. (Tr. 50) The home was ultimately subject to a refinance,
then later sold through short sale in 2016 after failing to sell after two years. (Tr. 51) It
was Applicant’s understanding that the short sale satisfied his outstanding loans related
to the property. (Tr. 52-53) He has not heard from any of the entities financially tethered
to  the  property  since  the  short  sale.  (Tr.  54)  There  is  no  documentation  showing  any
attempts  to  ascertain  the  account’s  current  balance  or  status.  Consequently,  the
account’s current status remains unclear.
1.b  –  Charged-off  credit  card  ($14,328)  –  Settled  - This  obligation  became
delinquent due to the failing restaurant. The debt was settled by the creditor, which offered
to end the matter for a lesser amount. (Tr. 56) That offer was accepted and satisfied by
Applicant. (Tr. 55; Ex. D-E) Applicant received an IRS 1099 form for this settlement, which
was submitted with Applicant’s 2020 federal tax return. (Tr. 55)
1.c –  Charged-off  account ($3,219) –  One  repayment payment made  - Applicant
initiated  contact with  this creditor in  the  past year. He  has made  a  $500  payment toward
the  balance. The creditor said  “they  will take payments as [he makes] them.” (Tr. 57; Ex.
F)  He  is planning  on  paying  off  the  remaining  balance  in  the  next few  months. (Tr. 57)  He
was unable  to  initiate  a  structured  repayment plan  because  the  account was so  old. (Tr.
58)  Applicant  provided   documentation   reflecting   a   payment  in   2015.  (Ex.  L)  The   last
known   date   of   activity  on   the   account  was   in   2016.  (Tr.  58;  Ex.  6   at  2)   There   is  no
documentary  evidence  showing  that a  pattern  of  regular repayment  on  this balance  has
been  established. (Ex. E)
1.d – Failure to timely file Federal income tax returns and state tax returns for tax
years 2013-2018 – All filed but 2017 - Many of Applicant’s tax issues arise from his former
wife’s  restaurant,  which  opened  in  2007  and  “almost  immediately  suffered]  fairly
substantial losses.” (Tr. 20). Applicant testified that after locating some missing Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) W2 forms, tax returns for 2013-2019 were filed in 2020. (see, e.g.,
Tr. 34-36, 39) He provided evidence reflecting that filings for tax years 2014, 2015, 2016,
and  2018  were  accepted.  (Exs.  I-K)  He  provided  no  such  documentation  for  tax  year
2017.
1.e – Federal tax debt in the amount of approximately $22,630 for tax years 2014,
2015,  2017,  and  2018  –  Initial  repayment  made  - See  above.  In  addition,  Applicant
testified that he is in repayment through an instalment plan with the IRS on amounts owed.
(Tr. 41;  Ex.  B) The first  payment  toward this  balance  was  paid the same  week  as  the
hearing. (Tr. 41, 45) It is his intent to complete payments on any outstanding balance.
1.f –  State tax debt in the amount of approximately $8,292 for tax years 2013  –
2018 – In repayment - Applicant has been in repayment on this debt. (Tr. 42; Ex. D) He
provided documentation showing his 2020 filing was received. He submitted paperwork
reflecting $1,645 was due to the state. Applicant’s exhibit D shows past payments to the
state
