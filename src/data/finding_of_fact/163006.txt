Applicant  admitted  to  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  and  1.h.  He  denied  SOR
allegations ¶¶ 1.i, and 1.j. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits,
and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  55-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with the defense contractor since November of 2005. He has held a security
clearance  since  June  of  2006.  (GX  1  at  pages  5,  10  and  34.)  He  is  currently  going
through  a  divorce,  and  has  two  adult  children.  (TR at  page  15  line  11  to  page  20  line
12.)  Applicant  completed  his  last  two  Security  Clearance  Applications  (SCAs)  in  2011
(AppX Q), and again in 2016 (GX 1).
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.b.~1.h.  Applicant  and  his,  now-estranged  spouse  had  a  rental-property  side-
business involving five properties. (TR at page 23 line 2 to page 29 line 18, at page 30
line 19 to page 31 line 10, at page 48 line 24 to page 49 line 3, at page 64 line 4 to page
65  line  2,  and  at  page  67  lines  6~13.)  With  the  crash  of  the  real-estate  market  in
2008~2009, Applicant and his spouse defaulted on the first and second mortgages on
these  properties.  (Id.)  He  disclosed  these  foreclosures  on  his  2011  SCA.  (AppX  Q  at
pages 30~35, and AppX R.)  Applicant owes nothing as a result of these foreclosures,
as evidenced by Federal tax documents, 1099c’s, and by credit reports. (TR at page 68
line 22 to page 70 line 14, and AppXs P and S~X2.)
1.a. and 1.i. In 2018, Applicant and his now-estranged spouse, defaulted on their
primary  residence  secondary  loan.  This  was  the  result  of  their  HELOC  (Home  Equity
Line Of Credit) loan payments increasing to the point that they could not pay them. (TR
at page 35 line 25 to page 42 line 22, at page 49 lines 8~21, at page 65 line 3 to page
66 line 16, and at page 67 lines 6~13.) The Applicant owes nothing as a result of this
default, as evidenced by a 1099c, and banking records. (AppXs H at page 3, L, and N at
page 3.)
1.j.  Applicant  is  current  with  his  state  taxing  authority,  as  evidenced  by  a
document  from  his  state.  (TR  at  page  42  line  25  to  page  44  line  19,  at  page  67  lines
14~18,  and  AppX  G.)  His  estranged  spouse  never  told  Applicant  of  their  tax
delinquency. Once he was appraised of the fact, said state tax was paid. (Id.)
