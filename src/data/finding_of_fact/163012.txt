Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a   28-year-old  employee   of   a   defense   contractor.  He   served   in  the
U.S. Navy  from  about November  of  2013  until  August of  2015, and  received  a  General
Discharge.  Applicant  has  been   employed   with   a   defense   contractor   since   2019.  He
currently   holds   no   security   clearance.  Applicant   is unmarried, and  has  no   children.   He
has  a   high   school  education.  Applicant  attributes  his  financial  difficulties  to   being
unemployed   or  underemployed   from   the   time   he   left  the   Navy  until  his  present
employment.   (TR  at  page   14   line   5   to   page   19   line   6,  and   GX   1   at  pages  7,  12,  and
20~21.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a.  Applicant admits that he  has a  past-due  debt to  Creditor A,  as  the  result of
an  automobile  repossession,  in the  amount  of  about  $15,847.  In  his Answer, Applicant
shows that he  has “Enrolled” this admitted  debt in a  “Debt Relief” program. (Answer at
page 4.) At his hearing, Applicant  further  avers that this debt was settled for $4,400, and
that he  is making  monthly  payments of  $574  towards this, his only  remaining  past-due
debt.  (TR at  page  19  line  14  to  page  26  line  21.)  I find  this  to  be  a  good-faith  effort  to
address this admitted  debt.
1.b.  Applicant  admits  that he  had  a  past-due  debt to  Creditor B  in the  amount of
about $1,353. In  his Answer, Applicant shows that he  has “Enrolled” this admitted  debt
in  the   “Debt   Relief”  program,  and   that  “Payments  [were]  Completed”   and   settled   for
$677. (TR at page  31  line  20  to  page  32  line  13,  and  Answer at  page  4.)  This allegation
is found  for Applicant.
1.c.  Applicant admits that he  had  a  past-due  debt to  Creditor C in  the  amount of
about $6,243. In  his Answer, Applicant shows that he  has “Enrolled” this admitted  debt
in  the   “Debt   Relief”  program,  and   that  “Payments  [were]  Completed”   and   settled   for
$2,498.   (TR   at   page   32   line   14   to   page   33   line   24,  and   Answer  at   page   4.)   This
allegation is found  for Applicant.
1.d. Applicant admits that he  had  a  past-due  debt to  Creditor D in the  amount of
about $283. He has submitted  documentation  in support of his averment  that this debt
has  been   paid.   (TR   at   page   34   lines   1~8,   and   AppX   A   at   page   1.)   This  allegation   is
found  for Applicant.
1.e  . Applicant admits that  he  had  a  past-due  debt to  Creditor E  in  the  amount of
about $457. He has submitted  documentation  in support of his averment  that this debt
has been  paid. (TR at  page  30  line  16  to  page  31  line  17,  and  AppX  A  at  page  2.)  This
allegation is found  for Applicant.
