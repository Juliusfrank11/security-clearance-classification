Applicant is a 44-year-old consultant, employed by a government contractor since
February 2019. He  is also  currently self-employed  as a real estate  sales person since
April 2017. He was terminated from a job in April 2016. Applicant reported that he was
unemployed from  March  2016  to  February 2017, despite his termination  in April 2017.
From  2006  to  2016,  Applicant  attended  various  universities  and  colleges,  but  did  not
attain  a  degree.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from  1995  to  2015,  and  was  honorably
discharged. He was previously married in June 1997 and divorced in October 2010; and
again married in June 2011 and divorced in October 2011. He is currently married since
December  2012,  and  has  seven  children.  Applicant  was  granted  a  conditional  secret
security  clearance  in  2003  with  a  caution  for  financial  concerns  after  financial
delinquencies  and  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy.  He  again  received  a  conditional  security
clearance  in  November  2007  with  cautions  for  alcohol  abuse  and  financial  concerns
(delinquent debts).
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant is delinquent on debts totaling
about $55,520 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.i). In addition, the SOR alleges that Applicant filed Chapter
7 bankruptcy on or about July 2002, and the bankruptcy was discharged in February 2004
(SOR ¶ 1.j). Applicant admitted all of the allegations with explanations. He also provided
mitigating evidence with his Answer. The record indicates that Applicant hired an attorney
to negotiate settlements of his debts.
Applicant stated in his Answer to each SOR debt allegation, that he was laid off
due to his Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) rated disability, which caused him to fall
behind  on  debts.  He  has  a  100%  VA  disability  rating,  with  a  30%  portion  for  anxiety
disorder, insomnia, and other stressors and trauma-related disorder (also known as post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combat and memory loss),  and alcohol use disorder.
Applicant was terminated from a job with a bank on April 11, 2016, due to his inability to
return to work. His termination letter does not specify the reasons for his inability to return
to work, but stated that he was not eligible for Family Medical Leave and was therefore
terminated from his position. Applicant stated in his 2019 personal subject interview (PSI)
by  a  Government  investigator  that  he  “put  off”  completing  his  VA  disability  application
after being discharged from the Navy, and instead took time from his employment at the
bank  to  work  on  his  VA  disability  requirements.  He  acknowledges  that  he  “knowingly
participated in his termination” and rather than quit the job, he elected to be terminated.
In 2002, Applicant filed a joint Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. He initially claimed
about $73,000 in secured and unsecured claims, but amended his petition in 2004 to add
an additional $12,033 in unsecured claims. It is unclear if the Chapter 13 bankruptcy was
converted  to  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy.  (GE  8)  According  to  his  2009  credit  report,  the
bankruptcy debts were discharged in 2004 under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (GE 4)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a debt of $8,613 owed to a finance company for a water softener
system. Applicant stated in his Answer that the debt became delinquent as a result of his
2016 termination, and has been satisfied in full. Applicant stated in his PSI that the debt
began in 2017 when the company would not remove the system that became too costly
for him. According to his credit report, the debt appears to have been placed for collection
in 2019. (GE 5) With his Answer, he provided a letter from the creditor noting that the
account  was  settled  on  June  29,  2020,  for  $5,400.  The  letter  indicates  the  debt  was
reduced  to  a  lien,  and  that  the  lien  was  settled  after  being  charged  off.  This  debt  is
resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b is a credit union auto-loan debt that became delinquent in 2017. (GE 7)
Applicant stated in his Answer that the debt became delinquent as a result of his 2016
termination, that he paid down the debt to  $19,000,  and  is “waiting  on  claims courts to
decide  on  payment  arrangements.”  Applicant’s  undated  credit  report  excerpt  provided
with his Answer notes that $25,257 was charged off, and a past-due balance of $19,453
is owed as of March 2021. Applicant’s May 2021 credit report supports the charged-off
amount and the past-due amount. (GE 6) There is insufficient evidence to show that this
debt was partially paid or is being resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.c  is  a  $240  collection  account  from  a  satellite  television  provider.
Applicant stated in his Answer that the debt became delinquent as a result of his 2016
termination, and that he has since satisfied the debt. No documentation of resolution of
the debt was provided. Applicant’s 2019 credit report shows the debt went to collections
in 2019, and is unpaid. (GE 5) The account is not listed on Applicant’s 2021 credit report.
There is insufficient evidence to show that this debt was paid or otherwise resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.d is a $7,370 collection account from a finance company; delinquent since
2019. In his PSI, Applicant denied knowing anything about the account. However, with
his Answer, he provided a letter from a collections firm showing the furniture store account
was paid in full as of March 30, 2020. This debt is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.e is a medical collection account for $44. Applicant stated in his Answer
that the debt became delinquent as a result of his 2016 termination, and that he has since
satisfied the debt. No documentation of resolution of the debt was provided. Applicant’s
2019 credit report shows the account was placed in collections in 2019, and is unpaid.
(GE 5)  The  account is  not listed  on  Applicant’s 2021  credit  report. There is  insufficient
evidence to show that this debt was paid or otherwise resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.f is a credit-card account placed for collection for $4,588. Applicant stated
in his Answer that he paid the account, and provided a credit report excerpt that shows a
similar account was paid and closed in September 2020. Applicant’s 2021 credit report
supports the payment of the collection account. This debt is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.g is a collection account for $5,620. Applicant stated in his Answer that
he paid the account if full. He provided a credit report excerpt that shows a total amount
owed was $5,744, a settlement was paid, and $5,620 was written off in May 2020. This
would indicate that $124 was paid toward the debt. Applicant’s 2021 credit report shows
a reduced amount was paid and that the creditor charged off $5,620. The debt is resolved.
SOR ¶  1.h  is a  debt  owed  to  a  state  utility  company  for $2,002.  Applicant stated  in
his Answer that he  is negotiating  a  settlement with  the  creditor. Applicant’s 2021  credit
report shows the  last payment  was made  in  2018, and  the  account  remains  delinquent.
There is insufficient evidence to show that this debt was paid or otherwise resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.i is a telephone company collection account for $1,794. Applicant stated
in his Answer that the debt has been paid in full, however no documentation was provided
to show resolution of the debt. The collection account appears in Applicant’s 2019 credit
report as delinquent  in  2019  and  unpaid.  The  account does  not  appear on  Applicant’s
2021  credit  report.  There  is  insufficient  evidence  to  show  that  this  debt  was  paid  or
otherwise resolved.
Since submitting his Answer to the SOR, no further evidence has been provided
to update or clarify Applicant’s answers to the SOR despite Department Counsel’s FORM
explanation of Applicant’s burden of proof. In addition, Applicant did not provide evidence
of financial counseling, his current financial status, character, or employment record to
assist me in evaluating his financial status and the “whole person” record.
