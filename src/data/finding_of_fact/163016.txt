After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  36  years  old,  divorced  from  his  first  wife  (November  2016)  and
remarried  (April  2017).  He  has  five  children  from  ages  12  to  19  (which  includes  two
stepchildren). Since January 2018, Applicant has worked for a defense contractor. (Item
5.) He had two periods of unemployment, from November 2014 to March 2015 and from
July 2015 to the summer of 2016. (Item 6.)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file federal income tax
returns for 2013 and 2014 and from 2016 through 2018, and that he owes the federal
government $3,855 for tax years 2013 through 2015. Applicant claimed that he did not
file his tax returns because he did not have the money to pay his taxes. Under the same
Guideline,  the  SOR  alleged  18  delinquent debts  totaling $19,290, of  which  $4,216 are
medical  debts.  Applicant  admitted  those  allegations.  In  a  number  of  his  answers,
Applicant that his “plan” was to “set payment arrangements.” (Item 4.) Applicant submitted
no documents evidencing such “plans.” The SOR debts were in arrears as of 2018 and
are currently delinquent. (Items 7 and 8.)
Under Guideline E, the  SOR alleged  that Applicant was  convicted in  November
2013 of driving under the influence and driving on a revoked or suspended license. His
sentence  was  a  fine  and  mandatory  completion  of  an  Alcohol  and  Substance  Abuse
Program  (ASAP).  He  failed  to  complete  ASAP  and  failed  to  pay  the  fine.  (Item  1.)
Applicant answered admitting those allegations and that he planned to take to ASAP and
pay the fine.  (Items 4 and 6.)  He submitted no documents  showing that he completed
ASAP or paid the fine.
