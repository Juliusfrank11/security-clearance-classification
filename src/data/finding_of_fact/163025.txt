Applicant,  age  27,  honorably  served  the  U.S.  Marine  Corps  from  2011  through
2015.  She  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2018.  In  October  2019,  she  was  offered
employment  by  a  defense  contractor  to  be  deployed  overseas  as  an  armed  guard,
pending  the  favorable  adjudication  of  her  2019  SCA.  She  has  been  employed  as  a
global  security  officer  by  a  biopharmaceutical  company  since  November  2019.  She
previously held a DOD security clearance in connection with her military service. (Item
3; Item 7 at 1)
The SOR alleged six delinquent debts totaling $29,056, consisting primarily of an
automobile  loan  account  totaling  $24,741.  In  her  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  all
but the following two alleged debts: SOR ¶ 1.d ($592 collection account); and SOR ¶ 1.f
($321  collection  account).  The  denied  debts  were  confirmed  by  her  credit  reports.
(Items 2, 4-6)
In October 2017, Applicant financed the purchase of a car with an $18,882 loan.
Her monthly payment was $520 per month. After she defaulted on the loan, the lender
charged  off  the  account  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $24,741  (as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶
1.a). She attributed this debt to an April 2018 accident, in which the other driver was at
fault.  Neither  Applicant  nor  the  at-fault  driver  had  adequate  insurance  coverage.
Although her car was deemed totaled, she remained liable for the loan. She engaged an
attorney to file a lawsuit against the at-fault driver. She continued to make her monthly
payment on the  loan until August 2018  when  her attorney  advised  her to  stop making
her monthly payment pending final adjudication of the lawsuit. On a date not indicated in
the  record,  she  withdrew  her  lawsuit  after  determining  that  the  risks  and  uncertainty
associated with the lawsuit were not worth the costs of her attorney’s fees. (Item 2; Item
4 at 3; Item 5 at 1; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 5)
In  January  2020,  prior  to  her  security  clearance  interview  (SI),  Applicant
discussed  with  the  lender  various  options  for  repaying  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a,
but had not yet reached an agreement for a repayment plan. During her January 2020
SI,  she  anticipated  finalizing  the  repayment  plan  within  a  couple  of  weeks  and  paying
the  account  in  full  by  the  fall  of  2020.  In  her  March  2021  SOR  answer,  Applicant
admitted the allegation, acknowledged that the debt remained unresolved, and advised
that  she  was  working  with  her  lender  for  a  “viable  solution.”  She  did  not  proffer  any
evidence corroborating her efforts to resolve the debt. (Item 2; Item 3 at 46-47; Item 7 at
3)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b is a charged-off credit-card account in the amount
of  $2,226.  This  account  was  opened  in  2012  with  a  credit  limit  of  $2,000.  During  her
January  2020  SI,  Applicant  admitted  that  she  used  this  credit  card  sometime  in  2014
while  deployed  overseas  to  purchase  a  round-trip  airline  ticket  to  visit  her  family  back
home.  She acknowledged  that  she missed one  or two  payments  while  she  was  in  the
field without access to a computer to make a payment. However, she claimed that the
account  was  paid  in  full  sometime  before  her  deployment  ended  in  September  2014.
There is no proof of payment in the record. In her March 2021  SOR answer, Applicant
admitted the allegation without explanation or proffer of a repayment plan. (Item 2; Item
4 at 5; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 3; Item 7 at 4)
The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  is a  collection  account  for  a  medical  provider  in
the  amount  of  $1,073.  The  original  creditor  was  the  provider  of  an  ambulance  ride,
which  Applicant  took  as  a  result  of  her  April  2018  automobile  accident.  In  her  March
2021  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  the  allegation  and  stated  that  she  is  “currently
looking  for  relief  with  [the  U.S.  Department  of]  Veterans  Affairs  to  cover  this  medical
cost.” (Item 2; Item 4 at 5; Item 5 at 2)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d is a collection account for a credit-card company
in  the  amount  of  $592.  During  her  January  2020  SI,  Applicant  acknowledged  the
account as a credit card she opened with a $500 limit. She claimed that she closed the
account  the  same  year  that  she  opened  it  since  she  no  longer  needed  it.  She  did  not
recall being delinquent on the account (other than maybe by a week) or being contacted
by  the  creditor for  any  past-due  balance.  She  planned  to  investigate  this  account  and
start making payment arrangements if it is deemed a valid debt. In her March 2021 SOR
answer, Applicant denied  the  allegation  and  stated  “I am  unaware of  this charge.”  She
did not proffer evidence of any efforts she made to investigate or dispute the debt. The
debt  was  validated  by  three  credit  reports,  dated  December  2019,  March  2020,  and
April 2021. (Item 4 at 5; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 2-3; Item 7 at 4-5)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e is a collection account for a utility company in the
amount  of  $103.  During  her  January  2020  SI,  Applicant  acknowledged  having  an
account with the utility company for electricity in 2015. However, she claimed that she
always  paid  her  bill  on  time  and  denied  that  she  owed  any  past-due  balance.  She
planned  to  investigate  this  account  and  start  making  payment  arrangements  if  it  is
deemed a valid debt. In her March 2021 SOR answer, Applicant admitted the allegation,
but claimed: “This was just brought to my attention via this notice.” She did not proffer a
plan for repayment or evidence of any efforts she made to investigate the debt. (Item 2;
Item 4 at 4; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 1; Item 7 at 4-5)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f is a collection account for a cell phone company in
the amount of $321. During her January 2020 SI, Applicant acknowledged that this debt
related to a cell phone she had and then suspended while she was deployed for eight
months  between  2013  and  2014.  Upon  her  return  from  deployment,  the  creditor
contacted her about a past-due balance. She claimed that after she presented a copy of
her  orders,  the  creditor  erased  her  past-due  balance.  She  also  claimed  that  she
remained  a  customer,  in  good  standing,  of  the  same  cell  phone  company  for  several
more  years.  She  planned  to  investigate  this  debt  and  start  making  payment
arrangements  if  it  is  deemed  a  valid  debt.  In  her  March  2021  SOR  answer,  Applicant
denied  the  allegation  and  stated  “I  am  unaware  of  this  charge.”  She  did  not  proffer
evidence  of  any  efforts  she  made  to  investigate  or  dispute  the  debt.  The  debt  was
validated by her December 2019 credit report. It did not appear on her March 2020 or
April 2021 credit reports. (Item 2; Item 4 at 4; Item 7 at 4-5)
Applicant  disclosed  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  on  her  October  2019  SCA.
She  explained  that  the  debt  was  “[c]urrently  being  paid  off  in  increments  and  a
settlement  is in  the  process  of  being  reached.” She  also  stated  that  she  was  “working
with  the  creditor  to  pay  off  the  rest  of  the  loan”  and  that  she  “just  need[ed]  a  better
paying career to help pay off the debt.” (Item 3 at 46-47).
Following  her  2015  discharge,  Applicant  enrolled  in  school  full  time  with  the
financial support of her GI bill and part-time employment. After obtaining her degree in
2018,  she  has  been  steadily  employed  full  time.  Applicant  did  not  proffer  any  details
about her income history.  During her  January 2020 SI,  she  characterized  her financial
situation  as  being  in  an  overall  better  place  due  to  the  income  earned  from  the
employment  she  began  in  November  2019.  She  also  asserted  that  the  income  she
anticipated  from  her  pending  employment  with  the  defense  contractor  would  be
essential in helping her to gain full control of her finances. (Item 3 at 47; Item 7 at 5)
