company  in  the  Bahamas,  which  he  started  in  2016.  (GE  1).  (GE  1,  Tr.  15)  He  is  a

The SOR alleges that Applicant has delinquent debt in the approximate amount of
$41,849.  The  debts  include  consumer  loans,  a  vehicle  repossession  and  collection
accounts.  Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  in  the  SOR  ¶1.a-h.  without  explanations.
Applicant  noted  that  he  has  had  various  periods  of  unemployment  over  the  years  and
some firings because he  left a project in 2018, so that he could be with his wife in the
Bahamas for their official wedding. They were married in 2016 in a simple ceremony in
the United States. (Tr. 24) His salary at that time was about $135,000 or $140,000. He is
currently earning $60,000 to $70,000. (Tr. 16)
Applicant acknowledged his financial hardship started in 2018, when he returned
from  his wedding abroad.  (Tr. 16) He was  unemployed from  October 2019  to  January
2020. In the interim, he was fired from a position from July 2019 to October 2019. (GE 1)
His SF86 reflects other firings from employment as early as 2010. (GE 1)
During  Applicant’s  investigative  April  2020  subject  interview,  he  stated  that  he
knows that he has various debts and will pay them once he is financially able. He had not
made any payment plans at that time either. (GE 2) Applicant basically stated the same
thing about each debt. The one debt he acknowledged  was a loan in 2016, a $40,000
loan for his official wedding in the Bahamas. He noted that his wife will one day be the
Prime Minister of the Bahamas. (Tr. 76) As to some other debts, he would research them
and when he is financially stable he would pay them. (GE 2)
As to SOR 1.a, a debt in the amount of $6,475 for the balance on a vehicle that
was  repossessed  in  2019.  He  bought  the  high-end  vehicle  in  2016.  Applicant  tried  to
negotiate with the credit union for pennies on the dollar, but they did not agree. (Tr. 29)
Applicant submitted a letter, dated July 15, 2021, setting up a payment plan for $300 a
month. (AE K) He stated that he was going to pay at some point, but because this was
important for his security clearance, he would go ahead at that time and begin to resolve
the debt. (Tr. 35) In the letter another loan is referred to and that would be SOR 1.d to the
same credit union for $100 a month. (Tr. 36) The charge-off amount was $14,077. (AE K)
He submitted proof of a payment of $100 and $300 from Applicant’s account in 2021. (AE
O).
As to  SOR  1.b, a  past-due  account from  2017, in the  amount of  $645, Applicant
provided  information  that he has a balance  of $2,929.67  as of  July  2021. This is for tires
and  wheels for  his vehicle. He stated  that it  was resolved  in  2019  because  the  company
took  his  car.  (Tr.  40) Applicant  elaborated   that  he   used   to   work  in   debt  collection   and
knew that generally if you left something long enough, you can just pay pennies on the
dollar. (Tr. 40-41) He offered  EX Q  showing  the  same balance  and  that  he had made
three payments of $31. In July and August 2021. The letter stated that he has 93 of 96
payments remaining, with a final payment due in April 2029. (AE Q) He could not provide
any proof of payment. (Tr. 43)
As to SOR 1.c, a charged off account in 2019, in the amount of $15,443. Applicant
opened this credit card account in 2014. He stated that it was probably used for travel or
his wedding. (Tr.44) He stated that it was resolved in 2019, but he knew it was just “shut
off.” He took no actions to resolve it. (Tr. 45) He submitted (AE M) to show that he made
a payment of $100 in June 2021. The current balance is $15,243.
As to SOR 1.e, a charged-off account in the amount of $1,919 for a “rolling pay pal
account, he did not remember. However he paid the account on May 14, 2021. (Tr. 52,
AE L, H)
As to SOR 1.f, a charged-off account in the amount of $473, Applicant paid the
insurance account in May 2021. He has multiple cars. (Tr. 46) He admitted that he made
no earlier efforts to pay. (AE N, H)
As to SOR 1.g, a collection account in the amount of $358, this was an outstanding
energy bill. He said that this is ridiculous worrying about minor “stuff”.  (Tr. 56) He paid
the bill in August 2021. (AE O. P) He stated that he is trying to “sell you guys weapons
here. This is ridiculous.” (Tr. 55) He continued to elaborate that why is the Government
worrying about such accounts when he is developing things that are a thousand times
worse than nuclear weapons.” (Tr. 57)
SOR 1.h a collection account in the amount of $232 is for another energy account.
Applicant has been aware of it for a long time. (Tr. 59) He paid it on July 15, 2021. (AE
R)
Applicant does not have a budget. He stated he always had enough money  (Tr.
73), and he has not sought financial counseling. His current employment earns him (after
taxes)  about  $4,000  ($50,000  per  annum).  His  wife  makes  about  $2,400.  (Tr.  60)  His
consulting company is dormant. (Tr. 61) He believes he has about $1,000 in his checking
account. His wife purchased a car and paid for it in full. He was not sure what he spends
on food, because some is for business expenses.
The  remaining  exhibits  that  Applicant  presented  (AE  S-AF) deal with  his  patent
work for the Government and the current state of global affairs. His plan is to go back to
making lots of money because he is not going to sit around and make little amounts of
money. (Tr. 73) He stated that he has a “whole list of projects and engineers lined up for
the military to get *s—t* in gear.” (Tr. 73) He also noted that he is setting up something in
another state to import labor from the Bahamas and build a base to run on for a political
positon there. He wants to stabilize the Bahamas so we can deal with China. (Tr. 76
Applicant noted that debt does not concern him. (Tr. 77) He wants to support the
United States. If paying off debts gets in the way of making investments in a business
and making moves ----that comes before debt. (Tr. 77) He started addressing accounts
and debts in 2019 or 2021 ….. because you also have the last name which “messes me.”
