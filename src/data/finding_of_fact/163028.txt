Applicant  is  a  51-year-old  systems  administrator  associate,  employed  by  a
government contractor since August 2019. He was previously employed full-time for the

The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  F  that  Applicant  has  a  past-due  mortgage
account  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $79,930,  with  a  total  balance  due  of  $56,682.
Applicant admitted the SOR allegation, with an explanation, and the debt is supported by
credit bureau reports in the record. Applicant’s credit report shows that delinquencies on
the mortgage first occurred in July 2017.
In his February 2021 Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that in 2016 and 2017,
he attempted to refinance the mortgage or get a loan modification on several occasions,
but was always denied. He stated that the family rented another home, moved out of the
house but left some personal belongings in the house. He intends to sell the home when
he finishes moving out. Since submitting his Answer to the SOR, no further information
has been provided despite being prodded to provide updated information by Department
Counsel in her FORM.
