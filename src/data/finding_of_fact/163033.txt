After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 57 years old. He is twice divorced and has one adult daughter, age
35. He served in the Army National Guard from 1982 to 1983. He received an honorable
discharge and immediately enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. He served on active duty until
he  received  an  honorable  discharge  in  July  1991.  Since  January  2018,  Applicant  has
been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor.  His  job  title  is  field  technician.  He  previously
worked for another federal contractor from January 2009 to October 2017 as an avionics
technician  before  resigning  from  his  job  due  to  “family  and  personal  issues.”  He  was
unemployed from November 2017 until his current employment in January 2018. (Item 2,
Item 3)
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  F  that  Applicant  has  nine  delinquent  debts
totaling nearly $45,000. Applicant admitted the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.i.
(Item 1)
Applicant disclosed several delinquent accounts on his  May 2018 SCA. He also
listed:  “To  (sic)  complicated  to  state  here  and  would  like  the  opportunity  to  explain
(financial issues) face to face.” During Applicant’s background interview in October 2018,
he explained that his financial hardships started in 2012. His daughter was going through
a  divorce  at  the  time  and  he  started  providing  financial  assistance  to  her  and  his
grandchildren. This financial support was provided despite the harm he suffered by not
being  able  to  pay  all  of  his  own  monthly  expenses,  causing  his  accounts  to  become
delinquent.  The  investigator  discussed  several  outstanding  accounts  listed  on  his  July
2018  credit  report,  to  include  the  delinquent  vehicle  loan  for  his  truck,  and  his  home
mortgage which reflected a foreclosure had been initiated. Applicant agreed with all of the
delinquent accounts and told the investigator that he was working to resolve his financial
delinquencies. He was earning more money in his current job than he did working for his
previous employer. (Item 2, Item 3, Item 4)
The Government’s brief noted that Applicant had not provided any documentation
with his response to the SOR. Department Counsel recommended that Applicant provide
documentation in response to the FORM to show the efforts he had taken to resolve the
financial  issues.  Doing  so  would  be  “beneficial  for  mitigation  and  review  by  an
administrative judge.” To date, Applicant has not provided any supporting documentation.
A May 2019 credit report showed that not one of the delinquent accounts alleged
in the SOR had been resolved, settled, or was in the process of being paid. His mortgage
delinquency  had  increased  from  $24,194  to  $27,123  when  compared  to  his  July  2018
credit report, and a new delinquent account appeared on the 2019 credit report. In April
2020, another credit report was obtained. It also showed that not one single delinquent
account alleged in the SOR had been resolved, settled, or was in the process of being
paid.  The  smallest  unpaid  debt  alleged  in  the  amount  of  $28  (SOR  ¶  1.i)  remained
unchanged and outstanding on all three credit reports obtained in 2018, 2019, and 2020.
(Item 4, Item 5, Item 6)
