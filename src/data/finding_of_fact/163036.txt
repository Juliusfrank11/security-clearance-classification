Applicant is a 50-year-old married man with four children. Three are 23-year-old
triplets and the youngest is age 16. (Tr. 17) Applicant earned an associate degree in 1993.
Currently, he works as an exhaust engineering technician for a defense contractor. (Tr. 13)
He has been working with this company intermittently since 2004, including consecutive
years between 2004 and 2013. (GE A)
Applicant is well respected on the job. According to his supervisor, he is a diligent,
organized,  and  dedicated  employee.  (AE  B)  According  to  a  coworker  who  first  began
working with Applicant in 2005, he has a strong work ethic and strong moral character.
Applicant has a history of financial difficulties, beginning in 2002 when his wife was
in a disabling car accident four years after giving birth to triplets. (Tr. 17) The accident
required multiple surgeries and rendered her unable to work full time for several years.
Although  her  loss  of  income  was  mitigated  partially  by  disability  benefits,  they  were  a
fraction of what she earned before the accident. (Tr. 20)
In 2013, Applicant’s employer laid him off. Although he promptly found another job,
it  was  temporary and  paid  30  percent  less  than  his previous  job.  After the  stint  at  the
temporary job ended, Applicant was unemployed for three months between March 2014
and  June  2014.  (Tr.  21)  Although  he  obtained  another  job  in  July  2014  and  worked
consistently for the next four years, he, for the most part, earned less than his pre-2004
salary. (Tr. 24)
In  2018, Applicant was rehired  by  the  company  that laid  him  off  in 2013.  (GE 1 at
11)   By   then,   he   had   incurred   three   delinquent  debts,   as  set  forth   in  the   SOR,  totaling
approximately $36,000.
Since working with the same employer since 2018, Applicant’s finances have begun
to stabilize. Moreover, his wife’s health has improved, which has enabled her to resume
full-time employment. (Tr. 20) In addition, she has a part-time job. (AE G) By November
2020, Applicant had satisfied the debt  for $2,388, alleged in subparagraph 1.c, and by
March 2021, he had satisfied the debt for $2,510, alleged in subparagraph 1.b. (AE C;
Answer at 2)
The  largest  debt,  for  $32,000,  as  alleged  in  SOR  subparagraph  1.a,  remains
outstanding. Applicant had been attempting to negotiate a settlement arrangement, but his
efforts were unsuccessful. In June 2021, the creditor and Applicant reached an agreement
where he promised to satisfy the debt with $300 monthly payments. (AE D) Applicant made
the first payment as agreed, on June 7, 2021, and made an additional $300 payment on
June 15, 2021. (AEs E, F)
Applicant  maintains  a  budget.  (AE  G)  He  has  $3,800  of  monthly  discretionary
income. Two of his adult children are working and are largely self-supportive. (Tr. 33)
