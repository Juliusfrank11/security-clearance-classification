Applicant is 54 years old and separated. He has a high school education and is
employed  by  a  defense  contractor as  a  Site  Manager.  He  is a  retired  master  gunnery
sergeant (E-9) in the Marine Corps. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A, 15, and 17;
Applicant Exhibit C at 4-5; Tr. 39-40.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  failed  to  meet  his  financial  obligations  and  is  therefore  potentially
unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
Applicant  denied  all  the  allegations  in  both  SOR  1  and  SOR  2.  He  also  submitted
additional information to support the granting of national security eligibility.
Specifically, the Government alleged in SOR 1 that Applicant had not filed his 2011
through  2018  Federal tax  returns  as  of  the  date  of  the  SOR,  May  14,  2020.  Applicant
denied this allegation, stating in Answer 1 that he had filed all of the subject returns in
2019.
Applicant retired from the Marine Corps in 2011 and began working overseas as a
contractor. All or most of the salaries of Americans who are working and living full-time
overseas  are  exempt  from  Federal  taxes.  The  maximum  Foreign  Earned  Income
Exclusion rose from $92,900 in 2011 to $103, 900, which covered all of his post-retirement
income  from  the  defense  contractor,  as  shown  in  his  tax  documents.  Such  a  situation
does not, however, obviate the requirement to timely file a tax return every year, or to pay
taxes on his retirement pay, which is subject to withholding. Even though his wages were
not  taxable,  Applicant’s  employer  withheld  Federal  taxes  at  the  zero  exemptions  rate,
which  meant  that  the  largest  amount  of  withholding  would  be  withdrawn.  Applicant
mistakenly believed that the fact his wages were not taxable meant that he did not have
to file a return. Applicant discussed this erroneous belief with a Government investigator
from the Office of Personal Management (OPM) on June 25, 2019. He later testified, “I
kind of looked at it as a savings account, to be honest with you. When I needed it, I could
get it.” (Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 25-27.)
On September 12, 2019, Applicant was contacted by a Department Counsel (DC)
from  DOHA.  That  DC  asked  Applicant  if  he  had  filed  his  tax  returns  from  years  2011
through  2017.  Subsequent  to  that  initial  email  DC  and  Applicant  continued  to
communicate through the remainder of 2019. In an email dated September 16, 2019, DC
stated,  “Because  it  appears  OPM  may  have  given  you  some  inaccurate  information
regarding this issue [Applicant’s unfiled tax returns]. I’m going to delay further processing
of your file for a brief period to permit you to address the situation.” (Applicant Exhibit A.)
Applicant subsequently stated to DC in an email dated November 20, 2019, that
he had filed all the required returns. The last email that Applicant had in his possession
is dated December 17, 2019. In that email he stated to DC, “I have been checking on my
status at least every other day and all that I can tell you is that I was told that it could take
6 weeks before I hear anything back since I had to do a paper return.” (Applicant Exhibit
A.)
Government  submitted  two  subsequent  emails  between  Applicant  and  DC.
Applicant emailed DC on December 30, 2019, stating that he still had not received any
new information from the IRS, but he had filed all the required tax returns. DC responded
on December 31, 2019, asking Applicant to scan and email him all of the documentation
Applicant  had  sent  to  the  IRS.  (Government  Exhibit  3.)  Applicant  stated  that  he  never
received this email. (Answer 2; Tr. 15-16.)
Turning to the specific tax years at issue:
IRS  records dated April 14, 2021, show that Applicant’s 2011  Federal tax return
was “received for processing” on December 30, 2019. Those records further show that
after  applying  various  credits  Applicant  had  no  balance  owed  for  that  year.  This
documentation also resolves the allegation in SOR 1.b that Applicant owed $805.31 for
that tax year. (Applicant Exhibits B at 1, C at 6-7; Tr. 23-24, 27-28.)
IRS  records dated April 14, 2021, show that Applicant’s 2012  Federal tax return
was  “secured”  on  December  30,  2019.  Those  records  further  show  that  after  applying
various credits Applicant had no balance owed for that year.  In fact, the records show
Applicant received a refund. This documentation also resolves the allegation in SOR 1.c
that Applicant owed $20,153.53  for that tax year. (Applicant Exhibits  B  at 2-3  and 9, C at
8-10; Tr. 29.)
IRS  records dated April 14, 2021, show that Applicant’s 2013  Federal tax return
was received for processing on December 30, 2019. Those records further show that after
applying various credits Applicant had no balance owed for that year. (Applicant Exhibits
B at 4, C at 12-13; Tr. 31.)
IRS  records dated  April  14, 2021, show  that Applicant’s 2014  Federal tax  return
was “secured” on  January  2, 2020. Those  records further  show  that  after  applying  various
credits and  transfers Applicant had  no  balance  owed  for that year.  This documentation
also resolves the  allegation  in SOR 1.d  that  Applicant owed  $1,255.50  for that  tax  year.
(Applicant Exhibits B at 5, C at 16-17;  Tr. 32-33.)
IRS records dated April 14, 2021, show that Applicant’s 2015  Federal tax return
was received for processing on December 27, 2019. Those records further show that after
applying various credits Applicant had no balance owed for that year. In fact, Applicant
received a refund for that year. (Applicant Exhibits B at 6, C at 18-19; Tr. 31.)
IRS records dated March 20, 2021, show that Applicant’s 2016 Federal tax return
was received for processing on November 25, 2019. Those records further show that after
this return was examined and various credits applied Applicant had a credit balance owed
to him of $8,216, for that year. According to Applicant he has yet to receive this money.
(Applicant Exhibits B at 7, C at 20-21; Tr. 30, 33.)
IRS  records dated April 14, 2021, show that Applicant’s 2017  Federal tax return
was filed on January 6, 2020. Those records further show that Applicant had a credit of
$7,837 for that year transferred out to his 2012 taxes. (Applicant Exhibits B at 8, C at 22;
Tr. 33-35.)
IRS records dated April 14, 2021, show that Applicant’s 2018  Federal tax return
was filed on December 30, 2019. Those records further show that Applicant had a credit
of $7,287 for that year transferred out to his 2012 taxes. (Applicant Exhibits B at 9, C at
24-25; Tr. 33-35.)
Applicant has been in discussions with the IRS about his 2019 and 2020 taxes.
Applicant  stated  that  he  is  ready  and  able  to  file  those  tax  returns  once  the  IRS  has
concluded their work with his old tax returns and finished sending him any money that is
owed to him, which the IRS stated would be by the end of May 2021. He also stated that
dealing  with  the  IRS  has  been  difficult  because  of  the  pandemic.  Applicant  further
indicated  that  he  believed  he  would  receive  a  substantial  refund  for  2019  and  2020.
Finally, Applicant stated that he would sure to timely file his returns in the future so as to
avoid this confusion. (Tr. 35-38, 40-41.)
