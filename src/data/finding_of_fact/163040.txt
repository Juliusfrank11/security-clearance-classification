Applicant is a 34-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor. He will
be hired if he receives a security clearance. He served in the U.S. Army Reserve from
2006 until he was honorably discharged in 2007. He is a high school graduate, and he
has college credits, but he has not earned a degree. He has never married, and he has
no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 25, 31-32; GE 1-3)
Applicant was born in Iran. His father moved  most of  the family to Iraq in about
1995  for  better  job  opportunities.  Applicant’s  oldest  sister  was  an  adult  and  chose  to
remain  in  Iran.  His  father  was  outspoken  about  the  Saddam  Hussein  regime  and  was
fearful  for  his  life.  He  fled  with  his  wife  and  his  children  to  Syria  in  about  1996.  The
family was granted refugee status, and his parents immigrated with Applicant and five of
his siblings to the United States in 1999. Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 2008. (Tr. at
25-28; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-4)
Applicant’s mother and siblings became U.S. citizens. His father returned to Iraq
in 2003 after the U.S. invasion. He thought he could help rebuild the country. Applicant’s
mother  went  to  Iraq  later  to  be  with  her  husband.  They  both  returned  to  the  United
States in 2019. His father is a permanent resident. (Tr. at 20-21, 27-30, 49; Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1-4)
One  of  Applicant’s  sisters  returned  to  Iraq  with  her  husband,  who  is  an  Iraqi
citizen. She is a dual citizen of the United States and Iraq. Applicant’s oldest sister is a
resident  of  Iran.  Applicant  is  the  youngest  sibling,  and  his  oldest  sister  is  much  older
than him. They were never close, and he has not  seen her since the rest of the family
left Iran in 1995. He credibly testified that his family in Iraq and Iran could not be used to
coerce  or  intimidate  him  into  revealing  classified  information.  (Tr. at  30-31,  54-56,  64-
65; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-4)
Applicant  worked  under  dangerous  conditions  in  Iraq  as  a  linguist  in  support  of
the  U.S.  mission  from  2008  to  2009.  A  U.S.  military  officer  praised  his  performance,
commitment to the mission, and honesty. (Tr. at 16-17; GE 1, 2; AE C)
Applicant  used  some  of  the  money  he  earned  working  overseas  to  start  a
business in 2009. The business was successful for a period, and then was undercut by
a  larger  competitor.  He  incurred  debts  that  he  was  unable  to  pay  in  an  unsuccessful
attempt to keep the business afloat, until he finally sold it in 2012. (Tr. at 16-20, 32-33;
GE 1, 2, 4)
Applicant had periods of unemployment and underemployment until about 2019,
when he started working with a company that would contract with individuals for work,
but the individuals needed a van. Applicant bought a van, and then added more until he
had  nine  vans.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  adversely affected  the  business,  and  he  lost
all but one van. (Tr. at 21-24, 33-36; GE 1, 2, 4)
The  SOR  alleges  six  delinquent  debts  with  balances  totaling  about  $26,700.
Applicant  admitted  that  he  owed  all  of  the  debts.  All  of  the  debts  are  listed  on  a
September 2018 combined credit report. Three of the debts became delinquent in 2013
or  earlier.  The  telecommunications  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  ($129),  1.e  ($2,209),
and 1.f ($1,284) were reported by TransUnion and Experian as becoming delinquent in
2015, 2016, and 2018. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5, 6)
Applicant retained the services of a credit repair company. He has not made any
payments toward any of the SOR debts. He asserted that the debt for the balance on an
auto  loan  after  the  car  was  repossessed  was  paid  through  the  sale  of  the  car  and
insurance  (commonly  referred  to  as  gap  insurance).  He  stated  that  two  of  the
telecommunications  companies  “basically  stole  [his]  money.”  He  was  told  by  other
creditors that the debts could not be located, and there is nothing else to be done. None
of  the  debts  are  listed  on  the  2020  Equifax  credit  report  or  the  2021  combined  credit
report. Those reports show no accounts with balances. (Tr. at 36-45; GE 5-7; AE A)
Applicant stated that his finances could be better, but they are currently in good
condition. He testified that he had about $14,500 in his bank account. He did not pay all
the federal incomes taxes due for tax years 2012 and 2014.1  He stated that he received
letters  from  the  IRS  about  six  months  before  the  hearing.  IRS  tax  transcripts  indicate
that  as  of  June  14,  2021,  he  owed  $1,104  for  tax  year  2012  and  $4,973  for  2014.
Applicant stated that he planned to pay his taxes, but it was difficult to get anyone from
the IRS on the phone. He paid the taxes owed for both years on June 23, 2021. (Tr. at
48-54; AE D)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
August 2018. He did not report any financial or tax problems. He discussed his finances
and several of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, but there is no indication that he
ever told the investigator about his delinquent taxes. He admitted he owed back taxes at
his hearing when specifically asked by Department Counsel. (Tr. at 51; GE 1, 2)
1   The  SOR  did  not  allege  that  Applicant  owed  back  taxes.  Any matter  that  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR
cannot  be  used  for  disqualification  purposes.  It  can  be  used  to  assess  Applicant’s  credibility,  in
determining the applicability of mitigating conditions, and during the whole-person analysis.
