Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 39 years old. He completed vocational school in 2003. He married in
2016 and has two children ages three and one. He has worked for the same employer, a
federal contractor, since 2008. (Transcript (Tr.) 18-20)
The SOR alleges five charged-off credit card debts totaling approximately $37,167.
Applicant testified that he incurred the debts from about 2007 until 2015. In his July 2018
security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed that he filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in
2015 and stopped paying these accounts. He stated, “I was in the middle of paying for a
wedding and fell behind on mortgage payments. I filed Chapter 13, but then decided to
pull  a  401k loan  and  pay my outstanding  debt to  lenders.”  (GE  1) The bankruptcy was
dismissed in September 2016 at his request. (Tr. 21-27; GE 5)
In June 2016, Applicant took a loan for approximately $49,000 from his pension
plan to be repaid over five years. He completed the repayment agreement in June 2021.
(Tr. 53; AE A, B)
In November 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He
told the investigator that he stopped making mortgage payments in 2015 because he was
paying bills for his upcoming wedding, credit cards, and regular bills. Applicant used the
credit cards alleged in the SOR to finance his wedding, vacation, and other things. The
wedding cost approximately $26,000. He used approximately $28,000 of the loan to bring
his mortgage current and another $16,000 to pay other delinquent bills. He did not  pay
the debts in the SOR because the creditors did not contact him. (Tr. 21-27, 33-35, 38-45;
GE 1, 2)
The  SOR  alleges  three  delinquent  accounts  to  the  same  creditor  in  ¶¶  1.a
($11,578),  1.b  ($11,106),  and  1.c  ($6,170).  In  his  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  he  had
delinquent accounts with this creditor in the total amount of $17,000 that were “charged
off, suspended, or canceled for failing pay as agreed.” In his SCA, he did not indicate how
many accounts he had with this creditor. (GE1) He indicated the accounts were opened
in January 2014 and the financial issues were resolved in January 2016. Regarding the
description of the action he had taken, he stated “Accounts are closed.” (GE 1) No other
delinquent debts were disclosed. (GE 1, 2)
Applicant told the government investigator that he was timely repaying his pension
loan and all of his delinquent accounts were paid with the loan. He had other delinquent
accounts that he had stopped making payments on in 2015, and that he used the loan to
repay them. Regarding the three accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b and 1.c, he told the
investigator that these accounts were in collection, and he had not received attempts from
the creditor to resolve them. He was aware the accounts were charged off and he did not
plan on making any payment arrangements unless he received collection attempts from
the creditor. (Tr. 38-45; GE 2)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted each debt and stated that he was
waiting for the creditors to offer him settlements. He testified that he fully intended to pay
his creditors, but was waiting for them to contact him. He took no action to pay or resolve
these debts in the previous five years. He said that he has about $6,500 remaining from
his  pension  loan  that  he  could  use  to  settle  the  debts  if  the  creditors  contact  him.
Subsequent to his answer, the creditor for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b and 1.c contacted
him  and  offered  to  settle  the  balance  owed  on  all  three  debts  ($28,856)  for  $8,652.
Applicant paid the settlement in March 2020. (Tr. 20-27, 30-41; AE C, D)
Applicant testified that he has not contacted the creditors for the debts in SOR ¶¶
1.d ($4,533) and 1.e ($3,780). Both debts became delinquent in 2015 and are charged
off. They are listed on his July 2019 and August 2021 credit reports. He testified that he
wanted to pay these creditors, and he may even call them after his hearing to settle. He
said he has a budget, but it is not written, and his brother is helping him with his finances.
He had financial counseling when he filed for bankruptcy in 2016. (Tr. 34-36, 45-48, 54)
Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered
for  disqualifying  purposes,  but  may  be  considered  when  applying  the  mitigating
conditions, in a credibility determination, and a whole-person analysis.
