After  a  thorough  review  of  the  testimony,  pleadings,  and  exhibits,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 62-year-old over-the-road long-haul truck driver who has worked for
a defense contractor since March 2018. He is seeking a clearance. He is divorced and
has one child age 23. Since 2010, he has lived with his partner to whom he is engaged.
(Tr. 28) They live, when not on the road, in his fiancé’s mother’s home. (Tr. 28)
Applicant is a Navy veteran who received an honorable discharge in January 1986.
(Tr. 10) He served in the Navy from 1977 to 1986. (Tr. 25) While in the Navy he served
four deployments to the Western Pacific (WESTPACs). (Tr. 26) The first and third tours
were for six months each, and the second and fourth tours were for nine months each.
(Tr. 26) He held a top secret clearance while in the Navy. (Tr. 33)
Applicant  worked  as  a  commercial  electrician  until  2005,  at  which  time  he  was
diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer.  (Tr. 21) He was terminated  from  his electrician’s
position when his sick leave ran out. He received unemployment compensation from May
2010 through October 2015, when he obtained his current job as a truck driver. (Tr. 9) He
was also briefly unemployed from January 2018 through March 2018.  He is current on
his  credit  card  accounts  and  other  debts.  He  has  no  problem  making  his  monthly  car
payment or the monthly amount he pays to the state Franchise Tax Board for past-due
taxes.  (Tr.  27)  He  currently  leases  his  truck  for  $4,000  per  month  and  is  looking  to
purchase a used truck. (Tr. 26) Before driving for his current company he worked for a
different freight line from October 2015 to January 2018.
Applicant  owes  money  to  the  Social  Security  Administration  (SSA)  for  disability
funds he started receiving in 2010. (Ex. 2) His then employer put him on medical leave
while he was receiving treatment for his stage IV lung cancer and terminated him when
his sick leave  ran  out. (Tr. 23) With  the  loss of  his  employment  his  medical insurance
ended. He began to receive disability compensation from the SSA.
In  October  2015,  he  started  training  to  become  a  truck  driver,  and  eventually
obtained a commercial driver’s license. (Tr. 29) He notified the SSA of  his employment
when he began earning income as a commercial truck driver. (Tr. 24) After notifying the
SSA he was working, he received a letter from SSA informing him that his case would be
reviewed and that he was still eligible to receive disability payments. In January 2017, he
received another letter stating the same thing. (Tr. 24) At some point thereafter, SSA sent
him a letter stating he had been overpaid and demanding he repay the funds at $2,000
per month. (Tr. 24) He was not in a position to pay that amount. He intends to contact the
SSA  again  in  an  attempt  to  reach  an  affordable  monthly  amount.  (Tr.  70)  He  had
purchased a boat in 2015, however, when he did so he was unaware of the debt owed to
SSA. (Tr. 77)
The SSA disability payments should have stopped in October 2016. Applicant was
overpaid  between  $20,000  and  $22,000.  His  November  2019  credit  report  lists  a
collection balance of $21,303 on this SSA account. (Ex. 11) Having finished paying $820
monthly on his Federal Tax debt, he is now in a position to arrange a repayment plan with
SSA and to start making payments. (Tr. 24)
On  Applicant’s  March  2018  Electronic  Questionnaires
Investigations
Processing (e-QIP) he listed he was repaying his 2005 and 2015 federal income taxes.
(Ex. 1) As of March 2019, he owed $9,995 in Federal income taxes for year 2005. (Ex. 3)
In April 2016, a $27,071 Federal tax lien was filed against Applicant for tax years 2002
($207) and 2005 ($26,864). (Ex. 9) As of June 21, 2021 the Federal tax lien was released.
(Ex. C)
for
In  2005,  after  his  sister  and  parent’s  died,  and  he  was  terminated  from  his  job,
Applicant cashed out his pension. At that time, he believed the company had withheld the
proper taxes before providing him with the balance. (Tr. 21, 36, 49) He stated his income
tax and the taxes  on his sister’s  and  parents’  estates  had added  to  the  confusion and
miscalculation of taxes owed. The result was he owed $7,866 in Federal income taxes
and  $9,995  in  state  taxes.  During  his  November  2018  enhanced  subject  interview,  he
indicated  he  was  paying  $829  per  month  on  his  delinquent  taxes.  (Ex.  2,  3)  His  IRS
account transcript shows payments starting in November 2009 and ending in July 2019.
Most of his monthly payments were for $820. (Ex. 3)
Applicant’s IRS account transcript dated July 2019 indicates he owed $3,165 in
Federal  income  tax  when  he  filed  his  2015  tax  return  in  April  2016.  He  had  $4,795
withheld for 2015. (Ex. 3) This resulted in overpayment of his 2015 Federal income taxes.
In  February 2018, $383  in  additional Federal income  taxes  was  assessed  for tax year
2015. His refund for 2015 was applied to his earlier tax debt.  As of  February 2018 his
balance due for tax year 2015 was zero. (Ex. 3) As of May 12, 2021, Applicant had paid
$27,071 for the release of the Federal tax lien for tax years 2002 and tax year 2005. (Ex.
C)
In April 2005, a $1,460 state tax lien was filed against Applicant and in April 2008,
an $8,700 state tax lien was filed against him. (Ex. 9) A  letter from the state Franchise
Tax Board concerning delinquent state taxes was not timely received by him because he
had moved to another state. (Tr. 39) Additionally, he was going through a divorce that
was finalized in August 2005, which added to his financial problems. (Tr. 40, 74) When
he received the notice that state taxes were owed, he immediately contacted  the state
tax authority and established a repayment plan. (Tr. 40) In 2016, Applicant began making
regular $250 monthly payments to the state Franchise Tax Board. (Tr. 22, 38, 41) As of
March 2020, he owed $7,475 on this debt. By March 2021, he had reduced the amount
to $4,758. (Ex. D and E)
Applicant continues to make monthly payments of $250 each to the Franchise Tax
Board. He provided documentation of his payments in March, April, and May 2021. (Exs.
F, G, H) As of July 2019, his 2015 state tax liability for his current state of residence had
been satisfied. (Ex. 3)
During  security  clearance  processing,  Applicant  was  made  aware  that  three
financial  judgments  had  been  filed  against  him.  (Tr.  71)  In  April  2004,  a  credit  union
obtained a default judgment in the amount of $10,668 against him for his default on a loan
for a pickup truck that was repossessed (SOR 1.h). (Ex. 4, Tr. 43) In January 2006, a
financial corporation obtained a default judgment in the amount of $10,085 against him
(SOR 1.i). (Ex. 5, Tr. 47) In May 2007, a partnership obtained a default judgment in the
amount of $8,703 against  him. (Ex. 6) Applicant intends  to contact the creditors of the
judgments and arrange repayment plans. (Tr. 51)
About the  judgment for  the  repossessed  truck, Applicant stated  that at the  time  of
the  repossession,  he was current on  his loan  payments and had full  insurance  coverage
on  his vehicle. (Tr. 44)  The  credit union  disputed  he  had  insurance  on  the  vehicle  and
took out a  loan  insurance  plan  even  after he  had  sent them  proof of  coverage.  The  credit
union’s   plan   added   $600   monthly   to   the   cost  of  the   loan.   (Tr.   44)  Unable   to   continue
paying his insurance, the monthly loan payment,  and  the  additional $600 charged by  the
credit  union   for  additional  insurance,  he   let  the   vehicle   be   repossessed.   After   the
repossession, Applicant  received  no  information  as to  a  balance  owed  on  the  loan.  (Tr.
43) He has recently  contacted  the  creditor who  demanded  he  pay  the  entire amount  owed
immediately. (Tr. 45)  He is not in  a  position  to  do  so.  After  addressing  the  remainder of
his past-due  taxes and his social security obligation, he intends to  pay this debt.
Applicant speculates the $10,085 judgment and the credit union judgment are the
same debt due to the original damages being so close in amount to the second judgment.
(Tr. 47) Although there is no proof that they are the same debt.
Applicant stated the $8,703 judgment filed in May 2007 may have been due to a
credit-card account. (T. 48) The statute of limitations on the three judgments is ten years
under  state  law  unless  the  judgments  are  renewed.  None  of  the  three  judgments  are
legally enforceable.
Applicant has two  small  medical accounts in  collection  (SOR 1.l, $355  and  SOR
1.m, $820), which he  believes are related  to  his lung  cancer treatment.  His credit report
does  not list a  point  of contact for the  larger of the  two  accounts  and  lists only  a  post  office
box  for the  other.  He stated  he  would pay  the  amounts if he  knew  whom  to  contact. (Tr.
52)
Applicant is not having  any  problem  meeting  his day-to-day  living  expenses. (Tr.
65) He  and  his  fiancé  have made a $10,000 down  payment  on a $90,000 home.  (Tr. 57)
Applicant  inherited   real  estate   from   his  sister’s  estate   which  he   hopes  to   sell   for
approximately  $80,000  in the  next few  months. (Tr. 49) In  June  2021, the  mortgage  on
his property  was paid and  a  notice  of cancellation  of  mortgage  was recorded  by  the  clerk
of court. (Ex.  B)
