Applicant  is  a  30-year-old  analyst,  employed  by  a  government  contractor  since
August 2018. She reported being unemployed from March to May 2018, and December
2017 to January 2018. She graduated from high school in 2009, and earned a bachelor’s
degree  in  2013.  Applicant  is  unmarried  and  has  never  applied  for  a  trustworthiness
position.
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  F  that  Applicant  has  nine  delinquent  debts
including a state tax debt of $1,260 owed for tax year 2017, and eight student loan debts
totaling about $54,405. Applicant admitted the student loan debt allegations, and denied
the tax debt. She provided no explanations with her answer or any documentary evidence
in  mitigation.  Applicant’s  public  trust  application  and  credit  reports  support  the  SOR
allegations.
In  her  public  trust  application,  Applicant  listed  that  she  failed  to  pay  2017  state
income taxes for $1,260. She noted that she was waiting for a tax refund from another
state before she paid the state tax debt. She also noted that she was “in contact with the
IRS  and  have  yet  to  hear  back.”  Presumably,  Applicant  was  speaking  of  the  state  tax
authority to whom she owes the debt, not the Federal agency. In addition, Applicant noted
that  she  owed  about  $65,000  in  student  loans  since  2013.  She  stated  that  she  was
“working on getting out or deferment, then paying on my student loans.” She also stated
that “I am currently paying on my student loans do not know the physical address to which
I owe my student loans to.”
Since submitting her Answer to the SOR, no further information has been provided
despite the Department Counsel’s notation of the absence of mitigating evidence in the
FORM.
