In  her  SOR answer, Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations.  Her  admissions  are
adopted   as  findings  of  fact.   After  a   review   of   the   pleadings  and   evidence,  I  make   the
following  additional findings of  fact.
Applicant is a  46-year-old  employee  of a  federal  contractor  performing  the  duties
of  an  administrative  assistant. She began  working  at her  present job  in June  2019.  She
has  taken   some   college   courses  for  which   she   incurred   the   student   loans  that   are
discussed  below. She  is twice married, most recently  in May 2019. She  married  for the
first time  in 1998  and  divorced  in 2011. She  has five  children  from  her first marriage, ages
28,  23, 22,  17, and  17  (18  in  October). Applicant  currently  only  provides financial support
for one  child.  She  receives $250  monthly  in  child  support  from  her  ex-husband.  (Tr. 6,  18-
20, 22; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  25  delinquent  accounts (student loans, medical,  and  consumer
debts)  totaling  approximately  $60,624. The  debts are established  by  credit reports from
September  2019, November  2020,  and  June  2021;  Applicant’s personal subject  interview
(PSI) with  a  defense  investigator in  October  2019;  and  her  SOR admissions.  (SOR ¶¶  1.a
–  1.y)  (AE  2-5; Answer to SOR)
Applicant  explained   that  her   financial   difficulties   began   during   her first  marriage
when  her ex-husband  controlled  all  financial decisions. When  he  left  her, she  discovered
that  all  the  bills were in  arrears  by  two  months. They  divorced  in 2010  and  she  became  a
single mother with  five  children  to  support. Her ex-husband  failed  to  pay  child  support for
approximately  seven  years. He  now  pays $250  monthly  for  the  one  minor child  living  with
Applicant, as  noted  above. He has  been  assessed  arrears for past-due  child  support,  but
Applicant  has  chosen   not   to   enforce   that  order  until  her  minor  child   is  emancipated.
Applicant claimed that their  divorce decree required her ex-husband to pay half of all the
children’s medical expenses,  which he  failed  to  do.  My  review  of  the  divorce decree  did
not  find  such  a  provision. A  2018  modification  order requires  Applicant to  maintain  health
insurance  for  two  children  and  pay  the  associated  premiums.  The  ex-husband  is required
to  pay  80  percent  of any  uninsured  health  care costs for the  children. The  original 2010
divorce  decree   does   not  address   this  issue.  Applicant   explained   that   she   could   not
address her debts after the  divorce because  she  needed  to  concentrate  her efforts on
supporting   her  children.  Other  than   a   month-and-one-half   period   of   unemployment  in
2016, she has been steadily employed. (Tr.  6, 18-20, 23-25  30-31; AE A)
The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
SOR  ¶¶   1.a-1.f-$3,335;   $9,183;  $2,593;   $2,593;   $2,389;  $5,251.   According   to
Applicant,   she   incurred   her   student  loans   in  approximately   2000   and   2004.  Her
September 2019  credit  report  shows that these  student loans were opened  in  either 2009
or 2010. This same  credit report indicates that all  the  loans were in  a  120-days past due
status.   In   her October   2019   PSI,  she   acknowledged   the   debts   and   that   she   had   been
“deferring”  them   because   she   could  not  make   the   required   payments.   In   her  hearing
testimony, she  stated she  had not  made  a payment in  over five  years and  she  reiterated
that  her loans  were on  a  continuing  deferred  status  (she  specifically  stated  she  was not
talking   about  the   CARES   Act  deferment  resulting   from   the   COVID-19   legislation). She
further  stated   she   could  provide   documentation   of   her  deferments  and   documents
showing   the   current  status  of   her  student  loans.  She   failed   to   provide   any   supporting
documentation  before  the  record  closed  on  August 6, 2021. She  claims that she  will begin
making  $250  monthly  payments  beginning  in October  2021. These  debts are unresolved.
(Tr. 26-28, 37;  GE  2-3)
SOR ¶ 1.g-$446.  This is a  cable TV  debt.  This debt was assigned  for collection in
August 2017. Applicant  claims she  disputed  this debt because  it was for cable equipment
that  she  had  returned.  She  claims  that  she  contacted  the  creditor who  was looking  into
the  matter.  She  failed  to  present supporting  documentation  of any  of  these  assertions.
This debt is unresolved. (Tr.  29; GE  3)
SOR ¶  1.h-$1,027.  This is a  telecommunications debt.  This debt was assigned  for
collection  in December  2018. Applicant claims she  will begin paying  this debt in October
2021. She  has not contacted the creditor. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 30; GE 3)
SOR ¶  1.i-$1,498. This is a  telecommunications debt. This debt was assigned for
collection   in  February   2016.  Applicant  claims   her ex-husband   established   this account
and  put it  in her name. She  plans  to  contest  this debt  with  the  help  of an  attorney.  She
has not contacted the  creditor. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 31; GE  3)
SOR  ¶¶   1.j-1.t-$753;   $130;  $851;   $601;   $444;  $2,325;   $1,843;   $660;   $1,075;
$2,463;  $400.  According  to  Applicant,  these  are all  medical debts incurred  by  her children.
She  claims, pursuant to  their  divorce  decree, her ex-husband  is required  to  pay  half  of  all
these  medical debts. I found  no  definitive  language  in her  divorce decree  supporting  her
assertion.  Regardless,  Applicant failed  to  produce  documentation  showing  that she  paid
her half of  the medical bills.  These  debts are  unresolved. (28-29, 36; GE  3)
SOR  ¶   1.u-$504.   This   is  a   utility   debt.   This  debt  was  assigned   for   collection   in
August  2014.   Applicant  claims  she   paid   this  debt   years  ago.  She   claims   she   could
produce  supporting  documentation.  She failed  to  do  so. This debt  is  unresolved. (Tr. 31-
32; GE 3)
SOR ¶  1.v-$37.  This is  a  utility  debt.  This debt was assigned  for collection  in June
2017. Applicant stated  she  would pay  this debt “today” (meaning  the  day  of  the  hearing:
July  8, 2021). She  failed  to  produce  any  supporting  documentation  of payment before the
record closed. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 32; GE 3)
SOR ¶ 1.w-$93.  This is a utility debt.  This debt was assigned  for collection in July
2018. Applicant stated  she  would pay  this debt on  July  15, 2021. She  failed  to  produce

unresolved. (Tr. 32; GE 3)
SOR  ¶   1.x-$6,445.   This  is  an   apartment-rental-damage-deposit  debt.   This  debt
was assigned  for collection  in  December  2014. Applicant  disputes  this debt.  She  claims
that   the   apartment  was  damaged   by   vandals  after  she   vacated   it   and   turned   over  the
keys.  She   failed   to   produce   any   documentation   supporting   her  dispute.  This  debt   is
unresolved. (Tr. 33; GE 3)
SOR  ¶   1.y-$20,685.   This   is  an   automobile   repossession   debt.  This  debt   was
assigned  for collection  in March 2016. Applicant acknowledged  this debt and  noted  that
she had  not done  anything to address this debt.  This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 33; GE 3)
Applicant  has  not  received  any  financial  counseling  or  provided  any  budgetary
information. (Tr. 35)
