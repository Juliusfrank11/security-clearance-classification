In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c,
1.e, and 2.a-2.l. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my
findings of fact.
Background Information
Applicant  is  a  53-year-old  senior  military  analyst  employed  by  various  federal
contractors since August 2008. He has worked for his current employer since April 2019.
(Tr. 16.) He received a security clearance in April 2008.
Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from  September  1986  to
September 1994 and from July 1996 to July 2008. He retired as a chief petty officer (pay
grade E-7).
Applicant married in February 1984, divorced in July 2008, married in August 2012,
and separated in July 2020. He and his wife intend to divorce. (Tr. 15.) He has a 20-year-
old  son  child  and  three  stepchildren,  ages  21,  18,  and  15.  He  earned  an  associate’s
degree in 2019. (Tr. 17.)
Alcohol Consumption (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.3)
In  March  1990,  Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  under  the  influence  and
reckless driving. During an interview with a security investigator in October 2017, he told
the investigator that he had consumed 4-5 beers and that he failed a field sobriety test
after he was stopped by police. He was convicted of reckless driving, fined, and required
to complete an alcohol safety action program. (GX 2 at 13.)
In 2013, Applicant found himself in a stressful marriage, living with a teenager, a
preteen,  and  his  mother-in-law.  He  started  to  increase  his  alcohol  consumption  to  a
couple of 16-ounce cans of beer and a half pint of alcohol every other day, and then his
alcohol consumption “got out of hand.” (Tr. 22, 38-39.) He began drinking 4-6 beers daily,
with a slight increase on weekends. (GX 2 at 2.)
In  June  2014,  Applicant  sought  help  from  a  psychiatrist  at  a  Department  of
Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital. He told the psychiatrist that he was consuming ten or more
drinks four or more times per week, and that he used alcohol to help him sleep. In June
2014, the psychiatrist diagnosed him with an anxiety disorder, alcohol dependence, and
nicotine dependence. The psychiatrist prescribed Naltrexone for his alcohol dependence.
Applicant testified that he disagreed with the VA psychiatrist’s diagnosis of alcohol
dependence, because he needed help coping with stress and not help with controlling his
alcohol consumption. (Tr. 22-23.) Starting in June 2014, he abstained from alcohol for
about  18  months  while  using  the  Naltrexone.  He  testified  that  he  stopped  drinking
because he wanted to and not because he had to. (Tr. 21.) In 2016, he resumed social
alcohol consumption, limiting his consumption to one or two beers, and then he stopped
drinking again from early 2018 until the end of 2019. (Tr. 29.)
In January 2020, Applicant had a violent confrontation with an intoxicated friend.
After the incident, he felt threatened by his former friend and  started to carry a firearm
with him at home. Applicant’s wife was concerned about his behavior and asked him to
leave their home for two-weeks.
Later in January 2020, Applicant met with his primary-care physician. During this
visit, he told the physician that his wife had asked him to leave the home, and that he felt
stressed  because  his  wife  did  not  respect  him.  (Tr.  30.)  He  told  the  physician  that  he
usually consumed one or two beers four times a week. However, he also disclosed that
he had consumed 28 drinks during the preceding week and had five incidents of binge
drinking during the preceding month. His physician advised him to abstain from alcohol.
(Tr. 34; GX 4 at 3-4, 8.)
At the hearing, Applicant admitted that he continued to drink beer “or something”
at social occasions, notwithstanding  his physician’s advice to  abstain from  alcohol. He
prefers  non-alcoholic  beer,  and  he  described  his  present  alcohol  consumption  as
“minimal.” He does not believe he has an alcohol problem. (Tr. 37-38.)
In  February  2020,  Applicant  consulted  with  a  VA  psychiatrist  regarding  issues
unrelated to alcohol use and was prescribed an anti-anxiety medication. The psychiatrist
advised him to avoid using alcohol or other drugs while taking the anti-anxiety medication.
(GX  4  at  4.)  Applicant  testified  that  he  did  not  consume  alcohol  while  taking  the  anti-
anxiety medication. (Tr. 44.) He continued to visit the psychiatrist on a monthly basis until
June 2020. (Tr. 35.)
In March 2020, Applicant was evaluated by a psychologist at the CAF’s request.
He  was  diagnosed  with  a  generalized  anxiety  disorder  and  moderate  alcohol-use
disorder. The psychologist noted that Applicant’s current alcohol use (about eight beers
per week) was not above the guidelines for use of alcohol, but that he also had five recent
incidents of binge drinking and had exhibited poor judgment by carrying a firearm at home.
She  noted  that  Applicant  was  compliant  with  his  medication  programs  and  enjoyed
previous therapy. Her prognosis was “somewhat guarded given that he does not currently
acknowledge   that   his   use   of  alcohol   has   been   problematic.”  She   concluded   that
Applicant’s  continued   use   of   alcohol  “could   potentially   pose   a   significant  risk  to   his
judgment,  reliability  or trustworthiness concerning  classified  information  and  that  “the  risk
to   judgment  and   reliability   of   any   future  mental  health   and   substance   use   problems  is
moderate as long as he continues to use  alcohol.” (GX 4 at 8.)
Financial Considerations—Federal and State Income Taxes (SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.i)
Applicant’s SCA reflects that he had two periods of unemployment from October
2008 to February 2009 and from February to December 2015. Both  occurred when his
employers were unable to obtain or retain government contracts. (GX 1 at 11-15.)
During  an  interview  with  a  security  investigator  in  October  2017,  Applicant
voluntarily disclosed that he had not filed his federal and state income tax returns for tax
years 2014, 2015, and 2016. He did not file his returns because he could not afford to
pay the amounts he believed owed for federal and state taxes. (GX 2 at 15.)
In  response  to  DOHA  interrogatories  in  May  2020,  Applicant  submitted  federal
income  tax  transcripts  reflecting  that  he  had  not  timely  filed  his federal  returns  for  tax
years 2012 through 2019. (GX 2 at 27-34.) In his narrative response to the inquiries, he
stated that he had filed his federal returns for tax years 2012 through 2019; that he owed
nothing for tax years 2012 through 2014; and that he owed $87 for 2015; $5,032 for 2016;
$176  for 2017;  and  $2,520 for  2018.  He  did  not  indicate  whether he  thought  he  owed
taxes for 2019. He did not respond to the question asking whether he had filed his state
tax returns for the same years, but he disclosed that he owned $619 for 2017; $1,076 for
2018; and $1,080 for 2019. (GX 2 at 3-4.)
In  Applicant’s answer to  the  SOR,  he  stated that  he  had filed  all his federal and
state tax returns. In his post-hearing submission, he provided documentary evidence that
that his state tax debts for 2017 and 2018 were paid in full in February 2021, and his state
tax  debt  for  2019  was  paid  in  full  in  March  2021.  (AX  C.)  He  requested  a  federal  tax
transcript  for  2017,  but  the  IRS  advised  him  that  it  could  not  provide  it  at  that  time,
apparently  because  of  an  unresolved  identity-theft  issue.  (AX  D.)  The  federal  tax
transcripts for 2018 and 2019 reflect that the returns for those years were both received
on November 23, 2020, and that Applicant owed $2,520 for 2018 and $2,358 for 2019.
(AX E; AX F.)
In March 2021, Applicant hired a tax-resolution service to assist him in resolving
his federal tax debt. (Tr.45; AX G) As of the date the record closed, Applicant had not yet
negotiated a payment plan for the past-due federal income taxes.
Financial Considerations—Consumer Debts
SOR ¶ 2.j. A credit report from April 2020 reflects a military credit-card account
referred for collection of $6,003. The account was opened in November 1993 and became
delinquent in September 2018. (GX 5 at 2.) Applicant admitted the debt in his answer to
the  SOR  and  submitted  a  printout  of  an  email  reflecting  a  payment  plan  initiated  in
November 2020 and providing for monthly $400 payments. (AX B at 4-6.) He provided no
evidence that he had made any of the agreed payments.
SOR ¶ 2.k. The April 2020 credit report reflects a collection account for $261. (GX
5 at 3.) In his post-hearing submission, Appellant submitted documentary evidence that
the debt was resolved in July 2021. (AX B at 1.)
SOR ¶ 2.l. The April 2020 credit report reflects a deficiency after repossession of
an automobile charged off for $11,562. The last payment was in September 2014. The
credit report reflects that the debt is disputed. At the hearing, Applicant admitted that the
automobile was repossessed after he was  20 days late on a payment. (Tr. 52-53.) He
disputed the debt because the lender would not give him an opportunity to make the late
payment and recover the automobile. (Tr. 57.) The debt is not resolved.
