In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  His
admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  47  years old.  He  was  born  in  Egypt  in  1973.  He  lived  in  Egypt  for
approximately  30  years  before  immigrating  to  the  United  States  in  2005  through  the
use of a spousal visa. He married his first wife (W1) in 2000, and he has three children
from this marriage. His son is (S) 19, his oldest daughter (D1) is 17, and his youngest
daughter (D2) is 16. He divorced W1 in September 2003 and married his second wife
(W2) in October 2003. W2 is a native-born U.S. citizen. Applicant and W2 were married
in  Egypt  and  lived  there  for two  years  until  they  moved  to  the  United  States  in  2005.
W2 sponsored  Applicant  for  his  spousal  visa  to  become  a  resident  alien  in  2005.  He
attained U.S. citizenship in 2008. He divorced W2 in 2013. He remarried W1 in 2016.
W1 currently  resides  in  Egypt  with  D1  and D2.  S  is  currently  attending  college  in  the
United  States.  Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  Egypt,  but  also  successfully
completed  the  general  educational  development  (GED)  test  in  2013.  He  received  a
bachelor’s degree in engineering in May 2018. He has worked for a defense contractor
since June 2019. (Tr. 36-37, 39, 58-61; GE 1)
Under Guideline B, the SOR alleged that W1, Applicant’s father (F), brother (B),
and two sisters (S1 and S2) are all citizens and residents of Egypt; that S is a citizen of
Egypt  residing  in  the  United  States;  that  D1  and  D2  are  dual  U.S.-Egyptian  citizens
residing in Egypt; that Applicant provides $500 monthly to his children living in Egypt;
and that he owns property in Egypt where W1, D1, and D2 reside. Under Guideline F,
SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  nine  delinquent  collection  and  charged-off  debts
totaling  approximately  $28,520.  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a-2.i)  The  debts  are  established  by
Applicant’s admissions and entries on credit reports. (GE 3-4; Answer to SOR)
Foreign Relatives
W1 (SOR 1.a, 1.d, 1.h): As related above, Applicant remarried W1 in 2016. She
is a native-born Egyptian who currently resides there. She holds an Egyptian passport,
which expires in December 2027. She has never visited the United States. She has a
law degree, but has never practiced law. She is a full-time mother. She lives in Egypt
with D1 and D2 in an apartment purchased by Applicant for approximately $20,000 in
2013. Applicant provides the sole financial support for W1 and their daughters. He has
daily contact with W1 either by telephone or internet messaging.  W1 has no affiliation
with the Egyptian government or military. She applied for U.S. resident-alien status in
June 2021. Applicant believes the application process could take as long as one year.
(Tr. 36, 42-46, 48, 50, 97-98; AE B1, B12-B14)
S (SOR 1.b): S is a native-born Egyptian citizen who acquired U.S. citizenship
through  Applicant’s sponsorship  in  2011, when S was still a minor. He currently holds
dual  citizenship  from  both  countries.  He  resides  in  the  United  States,  where  he  is
attending college. S has no intention to return to Egypt after he completes college. He
has  no  affiliation  with  the  Egyptian  government  or  military.  (Tr.  47-48,  50;  69-70;  AE
B4-B7)
D1  and  D2  (SOR  1.c):  D1  and  D2  are  native-born  Egyptian  citizens  who
acquired  U.S. citizenship through  Applicant’s  sponsorship in 2011, when they were still
minors. They  both  currently  reside  in  Egypt  with  their  mother, W1  and  are  supported
financially by Applicant. They attend an American school in Egypt to prepare them for
college  in  the  United  States.  Applicant  is  fearful  for  their  safety  in  Egypt,  not
necessarily from the government or terrorism, but because of the prevalent street crime
that exists there. He hired a driver to take them to and from school for safety reasons.
D1  is  now  a  senior  in  high  school.  Applicant  intends  for  them  to  come  to  the  United
States  with  W1  when  her  immigration  application  is  approved,  or  he  will  bring  them
both  to  the  United  States even  if W1’s application  is  not finalized.  They both visited the
United States this summer and stayed with Applicant for about two months.  Applicant
has daily contact with D1 and D2 either by telephone or internet messaging. Neither D1
nor D2 have affiliations with the Egyptian government or military. (Tr. 43, 46-48, 50, 69-
70, 72-75, 97-98; AE B8-B11)
F (SOR 1.e): F is a native-born Egyptian who also resides there. He is 84 years
old and  is retired  from  the  oil  industry  and  living  on  a  “good” pension.  Applicant does
not provide any financial support to F. According to Applicant, F is “very sick” and lives
with  B.  Applicant  has  frequent  contact  with  his  father  because  of  his  health  through
telephone  calls  or  messages.  After  his  mandatory  military  service  in  1973,  F  had  no
further affiliation with the Egyptian government or military. (Tr. 49-51, 75-76; GE 1)
B (SOR 1.f): B is a native-born Egyptian who also resides there. He is 34 years
old.  He works for the same private  sector oil company for whom F worked.  Applicant
does  not  provide  any  financial  support  for  B.  Since  F  lives  with  B,  Applicant  has
frequent  contact  with  B  acting  as  a  conduit  to  communicate  with  F.  Otherwise,
Applicant’s  substantive   contact   with   B   is  less  than   twice  a   month.   B   has   no   affiliation
with the Egyptian government or military. (Tr. 50-51, 75-76; GE 1)
S1  and  S2  (SOR  1.g):  S1  and  S2  are  native-born  Egyptians  who  also  reside
there.  S1  is  52  years  old  and  S2  is  41  years  old.  Neither  work  outside  the  home.
Applicant does not provide any financial support to either of them. He has contact with
his sisters less frequently than with F or B, probably twice a year. S1 and S2 have no
affiliation with the Egyptian government or military. (Tr. 50-52, 78; GE 1)
Applicant testified that he never voted in an Egyptian election the entire time he
resided there. Upon gaining U.S. citizenship, he voted in the 2008 Presidential election,
which was the last time he voted. He also stated that after he divorced W2 in 2010 he
went through some difficult times until he obtained his college degree in 2018. Those
difficult  times  contributed  to  his  financial  problems  discussed  below.  To  continue  to
support  his family  living  in  Egypt  while  he  was  in  college,  he  worked  low-paying  jobs
and  lived  in  his  car  for  several  months.  He  is  now  in  a  much  more  stable  financial
position, with an annual salary of approximately $190,000. This has allowed him to pay
his delinquent debts, purchase a home, and establish some savings. He believes once
all  of  his  children  come  to  the  United  States,  they  will  permanently  reside  here.  He
intends to sell his apartment in Egypt once his family comes to the United States. He
last visited Egypt from September 2018 to January 2019.  He stayed with his family in
their  apartment.  He  returned  to  help  tutor  his  son  in  preparation  to  take  his  college
scholastic aptitude test (SAT). (Tr. 41, 49, 53, 63, 65, 67, 70, 79, 81)
Egypt
Several  terrorist  organizations  operate  in  Egypt.  In  2014,  the  most  active
terrorist group operating there pledged its allegiance to ISIS. The U.S.  Department of
State  has  assessed  Cairo  as  a  critical-threat  location  for  terrorism  directed  at  U.S.
Government  interests.  It also has been  given  a Level 3 travel advisory.  The Egyptian
Government does not respect the full spectrum of human rights.
Financial
Applicant recently resolved his remaining debts. He explained that he did not act
sooner  to  resolve  them  because  he  did  not  obtain  his  current  well-paying  job  until
2019. He also did not understand the security significance or implications of having bad
debts until after he began seeking a security clearance. He recently purchased a home
and his most recent credit report shows all his debts are current. (Tr. 82, 84; GE 5; AE
C1 – C5)
