Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 55 years old and works for a defense contractor as a technician. He
served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps (1985-1989). He has married and divorced
twice (1985-2014 and 2014-2019). He separated from his first wife in 2003. He and his
first wife have five children. After their separation, he was the custodial parent for two of
the children when they were minors. They are now 23 and 35. Applicant earned a high
school diploma and has taken some college and technical school courses. He has worked
in  the aviation  industry and  specifically for defense  contractors for  much of  his career.
Counting his four years in the Marine Corps and again more recently as a contractor, he
has held a security clearance for about eight years. He has never had a security violation.

SOR Allegations
Paragraph 1, Guideline F - The SOR sets forth allegations regarding Applicant’s
failures to file his federal and state income tax returns for several years and pay his federal
and state tax liabilities dating back to 2003 and as recently as 2019. Applicant’s combined
state and federal past-due tax liabilities total over $90,000. The SOR also alleges a 2013
Chapter 7 bankruptcy and two delinquent consumer debts totaling about $2,600.
The details regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:
Failure  to  file  federal income  tax  returns  - In  his Answer,  Applicant admitted  that
he  failed  to  timely  file  his federal tax  returns for the  tax  years (TY)  2010  through  2019.
(SOR 1.k.)  He  reported  in his answers to  the  Government’s interrogatories that he  filed
the returns for TY  2011 through  TY  2016  on  September 11, 2020, and the returns  for TY
2017  through  TY  2019  on  August 15, 2020. He also wrote  that he  was working  with  his
accountant on the  federal return for TY  2010. As of the close  of the record, there was no
evidence  that he  filed  his 2010  federal tax  return. The  returns for the  later years were filed
before Applicant received  the SOR in December 2020. (Tr. at 35-40; GE  2 at 2.)
Failure  to  file  state income  tax  returns  - In  his Answer,  Applicant admitted  that
he  failed to  timely  file  his tax returns  for State  1  for TY  2010 through  TY  2016.  (SOR  1.l.)
He also admitted  that he  failed  to  timely  file  his  tax  returns for State  2  for TY  2017  through
2019. (SOR  1.cc.) He  reported  in  his answers to  the  Government’s interrogatories  that
he  filed  the returns for TY 2011 through  TY  2016 in  State 1  on September 11, 2020, and
the  returns for TY  2017  through TY  2019  in State  2  on  August 15, 2020. Both  filing  dates
predate  Applicant’s receipt  of the  SOR. He  provided  no  evidence  that he  has filed  his tax
return  in   State   1   for  TY   2010.   Applicant   testified   that   he   should   have   filed   his   returns
because   he   had   sufficient  withholding   to   pay   his  tax   liability.  He  attested   that  all
assessments  by  the  state  tax  authorities were  due  to  the  states’  estimating  what he  owed
and  penalizing him for not filing. (Tr. at 42-43; GE  2  at 4.)
Failure  to  pay  federal income  taxes  – Applicant admitted  in his Answer that he
owed  the  U.S. Government  past-due  income  taxes  in a  total amount  of  about $78,000  for
TY  2003  and  TY  2004  (SOR 1.b), TY  2006  (SOR 1.d), TY  2007  (SOR 1.f), TY  2008 (SOR
1.g), TY  2009  (SOR 1.h), TY  2011  (SOR  1.o), TY  2012  (SOR 1.q), TY  2013  (SOR 1.u),
TY  2014  (SOR 1.w), TY  2015 (SOR 1.y), TY  2016  (SOR 1.aa), TY  2017  (SOR  1.dd), TY
2018  (SOR  1.ff), and  TY  2019  (SOR 1.hh). In  his  interrogatory  responses, he  wrote  that
his  total  federal  tax   liability   for  TY   2011   through   TY   2019   is  $43,425.  He   disclosed,
however, tax liabilities by each tax year during that period totaling  more than  $60,000.
Applicant testified  that  the  IRS  has  “forgiven” his past-due  taxes. After the  hearing,
Applicant provided  a  letter from  the  IRS, dated  July  22,  2021,  referencing  TY  2008  and
TY  2011  –  2020. In  that letter, the  IRS  informed  Applicant  that it  was closing  its case  for
the   collection   of   Applicant’s  tax   liabilities  for  the   referenced   years  as  “Currently   Not
Collectible.” The  IRS  noted  further the  Applicant “still  owe[d] $94,168.43  to  the  IRS  for the
[referenced]   tax   periods.”  The   letter  further  noted   that   this  tax   liability   will  continue   to
accrue  penalties  and  interest,  and  the  collection  case  is subject to  reopening  if  Applicant’s
“financial situation  improves in the  future.” The  IRS  also  advised  Applicant that it  will file
a  Notice  of Federal T  ax  Lien  to  protect the  Government’s interest.  (Tr. at  38-41;  GE  2  at
2, 3; AE  E.)
Failure  to  pay  state income  and sales  taxes  –  Applicant admitted  in his Answer
that he  owed  past-due  income  taxes to  State  1  for TY  2006  (SOR 1.e), TY  2009  (SOR
1.i), TY  2011  (SOR 1.p), TY  2012  (SOR 1.r), TY  2013  (SOR  1.v), TY  2014  (SOR 1.x),
TY  2015  (SOR 1.z), and  TY  2016  (SOR 1.bb). He also  admitted  that he  owed  State  1
sales tax  for  TY  2009  (SOR 1.j) and  that  State  1  filed  two  tax  liens against  him  in  2011
(SOR 1.m  and  1.n)  and  a  wage  garnishment in  2013 (SOR 1.t).  In  addition,  he admitted
in his Answer that he  owed  taxes to  State  2  for TY  2003  (specifically, a  State  2  county
tax)  (SOR 1.a), TY  2017  (State 2  income tax)  (SOR 1.ee),  and  TY  2018  (State  2  income
tax) (SOR 1.gg).  He also admitted  that State  2  filed  a  tax  lien  against him  in 2006  (SOR
1.c). His state  tax  delinquencies,  as  alleged  in  the  SOR and  admitted  in  his Answer, total
about  $18,000.   In   his interrogatory   responses,  he   advised   that   his   total tax   liability   to
States   1   and   2   was  $6,782.   Applicant   testified   that  he   had   entered   into   an   installment
payment plan with  State 1 to  pay it $40 per month until his tax liability is paid off.
After the hearing, Applicant submitted a letter from the tax collection department
of State 1, dated June 21, 2021, acknowledging receipt of his application for an “Offer in
Compromise.” The state agency wrote that it would inform Applicant if his settlement offer
was accepted “as soon as possible.” Applicant testified that State 2 has forgiven his tax
liabilities based upon his current finances. However, he  submitted after the hearing an
installment agreement, dated July 6, 2021, that he entered into with State 2 to pay $40
per month, which reflects that State 2 is requiring Applicant to begin to pay his delinquent
tax liability.  (Tr. at 38-41, 43-44, 59; GE 2 at 4-5; GE 4-6; AE A; AE D.)
2013  Chapter 7  Bankruptcy  –  Applicant admitted in his Answer that in January
2013  he  filed  a  petition  for  bankruptcy  under  Chapter  7  and  that  he  was  granted  a
discharge of  his debts in May 2013. (SOR 1.s.) In his petition, he listed  43 unsecured
non-priority debts totaling about $32,000 that were subsequently discharged. He testified
that he incurred these debts “to keep my family alive.” He also listed unsecured priority
tax debts owed to the IRS in the total amount of about $30,000 for TYs 2003, 2004, and
2006-2009 and debts owed to State 1 for delinquent income taxes in TYs 2006 and 2009
and  a  delinquent  sales  tax  debt  in  TY  2009  arising  from  his  purchase  of  a  vehicle  in
another state. The total amount of the debts listed as owed to State 1 was about $12,000.
Lastly,  he  listed  a  State  2  county  tax  debt  for  TY  2003,  which  he  incurred  when  he
previously lived in State 2. None of the unsecured priority tax debts were discharged in
the bankruptcy proceeding. (Tr. at 47-48; GE 3 at 23-32, 60.)
Delinquent  debts  in  collection  –  Applicant admitted in his Answer two debts that
were placed for collection. (SOR 1.ii and 1.jj.) He commented further that the debts were
“incurred by” or “belongs to” his ex-wife. He also wrote that they were included in his 2013
bankruptcy.  Neither  the  creditors  nor  the  debts,  however,  are  listed  in  his  bankruptcy
petition. Applicant provided no evidence that linked either of the two debts to any of the
debts listed in his bankruptcy petition. According to the Government’s evidence, the debt
alleged in SOR 1.ii for $1,008 is owed to a former landlord in State 1 and arises from a
lease  default  in  about 2014.  Applicant testified  that  he  had a  dispute  with  the  landlord
about an infestation of roaches in the apartment. The debt alleged in SOR 1.jj for $1,622
was a credit-card account owed to a bank before it was referred to a collection agency.
Applicant defaulted on the debt in about 2018. He testified that the credit card belonged
to his ex-wife. Neither debt has been resolved. (Tr. at 51-54.)
Applicant testified that it was never his intent to neglect his financial obligations to
the  Government  or  others.  He  explained  that  his  actions  were  simply  the  result  of  his
difficult circumstances. Applicant felt that his obligations as a father of five children had
to take precedence over certain other obligations. His service with the Marine Corps gave
him a sense of duty and honor. His duties to his family and his country have always been
important  to  him.  He  believes  he  has  provided  “unwavering  devotion  regardless  of
personal sacrifice “ to both. Beginning in 2003 when his children were young and his first
wife left him, he has struggled to support himself and the two children for whom he was
the custodial parent as well as his three other children who lived with his wife. He worked
in State 1 in low-wage positions below his skill level. He was required to move frequently
for different jobs.  (Tr. at 11-12, 30-32, 40-45; AE C.)
Since his return to State 2 in 2017, he has begun the “process of becoming whole
again.”  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  major  defense  contractor,  since
January  2019.  He  has  now  filed  his  tax  returns,  including  his  2020  returns,  and  is
beginning to make payment arrangements to pay his delinquent taxes to States 1 and 2.
He owes the IRS an additional $2,000 for 2020, but he claims that has been “forgiven” as
well. As noted above, the IRS is simply not seeking to collect Applicant’s delinquent taxes
at this time.
For  TY  2020,  Applicant  was  entitled  to  a  tax  refund  from  State  2,  where  he
presently  works  and  resides,  but  the  state  is  retaining  the  funds  to  apply  against  his
delinquent  taxes.  Applicant  intends  to  continue  filing  his  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns in a timely manner in the future. Applicant failed to provide any significant reasons
for his failure to timely file his federal and state tax returns for many years other than the
fact that he was overwhelmed with his difficult circumstances. (Tr. at 11-12, 30-32, 40-45;
AE C.)
Applicant’s current net pay is about $3,400 per month. His monthly rent is $1,695.
He  drives  a  2017  Jaguar,  which  he  testified  he  recently  bought  used  for  $19,000.  His
monthly  car  payment  is  $480.  The  Government’s  March  23,  2021,  credit  report  in  the
record (GE 7) reflects that on July 30, 2020, Applicant opened a car loan account with a
high credit amount of $26,912. His monthly payment on this account is $488.  After paying
his rent and car note, he is left with about $1,200 to pay his remaining expenses, including
his tax installment payments to States 1 and 2. Applicant asserted in a written statement
that  he  received  financial  counseling  online  and  through  his  employer,  but  this  is
otherwise undocumented. He notes that with this counseling has become a “responsible
credit card holder in good standing.” GE 7 lists four active credit cards. (Tr. at 48-51; GE
7 at 2-4.)
Whole-Person Evidence
Applicant’s long-time friend testified in support of Applicant’s character. The friend
has  also  worked  with  Applicant  in  the  past.  Applicant  helped  his  friend  develop  the
necessary technical skills to be successful and support his family. The witness testified
that  Applicant  is  “one  of  the  most  upstanding  guys  I  know.”  He  praised  Applicant’s
honesty.  The  witness  addressed  the  financial  problems  Applicant  faced  when  he  was
going through a divorce. Applicant’s first wife cheated on him and divorced him leaving
him with two children to raise on his own. Applicant struggled during these difficult times
and acted responsibly taking care of his children.  (Tr. at 19-23.)
Applicant  also  provided  a  reference  letter  and  a  performance  review  from  his
current employer. The writers praise Applicant’s technical skills, dedication, and positive
attitude. (AE B-1 and B-2.)
