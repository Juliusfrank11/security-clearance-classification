Applicant  admitted to  the  allegations  in  SOR ¶¶  1.a,  through 1.c.  It is unclear if
Applicant  admitted  or  denied  the  allegation  in  SOR  allegation  ¶  2.a.,  which  makes
reference  to  and  subsumes  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  through  1.c.  I  consider  it  a  denial.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 14 line
23  to  page  19  line  9,  and  GX  1  at  page  5.)  He  has  been  employed  with  defense
contractors since 2004. He has held a security clearance  since March of 2005. (TR at
page 14 line 23 to page 19 line 9, and GX 1 at pages 12~17, and 43.)  He is married,
and has one adopted child, age 13. (GX 1 at pages 23 and 29.)

1.c.  and  2.a. Applicant  admits that in  2008,  while working  for a  different employer
from   his  current   employer,  he   “cut   corners”   and   sent   an   email   containing   classified
information   to   co-workers  on   an   unclassified   network.  Applicant   received   a   written
warning  as a  result of  this security  clearance  violation.  (TR at page  19  line  10  to  page
22 line 20, and at page 49 lines 13~17.) I find  his actions to be  deliberate.
1.b.  and   2.a.  Applicant  admits  that  in  2013,  while   working   for  his  current
employer, he  again sent an  email  containing  classified  information  to  co-workers on  an
unclassified   network. Applicant  sent   unclassified   information   that,  when   combined   with
other   unclassified   information   he   sent,  became   classified.  Applicant  received   a   verbal
reprimand  as  a  result of  this security  clearance  violation. (TR at  page  26  line  23  to  page
35  line  10, and  at page  49  line  18  to  page  50  line  4, and  GX  3.) I find  his actions to  be
negligent.
1.a.  and  2.a.  Applicant  admits  that  in  2017,  while  working  for  his  current
employer,  he  sent  a  third  email  containing  classified  information  to  co-workers  on  an
unclassified network. Applicant avers this to be a systemic problem with his employer’s
system  for  handling  classified  information.  Applicant  received  a  verbal  and  written
warning as a result of this security clearance violation. (TR at page 35 line 11 to page
44  line  4,  and  at  page 50  line  5  to  page  51  line  1,  and  GX 4.) I  find  his actions  to  be
inadvertent.
