Navy  from  1975  to  1981  receiving  an  honorable  discharge.  (Item  1)  He  obtained  an

been employed as an analyst from July, 2019 to the present.  (Item 1) Before that he was

The   SOR  alleges   that  Applicant   is  indebted   to   the   Federal  Government   for
delinquent   taxes  in  the   approximate   amount  of  $5,378   for   tax   year  2015   (1.a);   that
Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes in the  approximate

(1.c); and  that  he  is  indebted  to  a  state for delinquent  taxes in the  amount  of $24,427 for
tax   year  2016   (1.d).   The   Applicant  admitted   all   the   SOR  allegations   and   provided
explanations.
Applicant stated the delinquencies are a result of significantly reduced income for
those years with an additional issue of a foreclosure on his state rental property in 2016,
resulting in a substantial Capital Gains Tax recapture for the Federal and state taxes. He
also acknowledged that he was delinquent on another state tax but has since repaid that
amount. He further stated that he is currently in a repayment arrangement with the other
state. (Answer to SOR) He also stated that he retained an enrolled agent to negotiate and
initiate a repayment plan with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
Although  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  Applicant  disclosed  in  his  security  clearance
questionnaire that he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2013, in the amount of $100,000.
All debts  were  discharged.  There  was  no  other information  concerning the  bankruptcy
other than financial hardship. (Item 1)
In response to Applicant’s interrogatories, he noted that he filed federal income tax
returns for tax year 2015 – 2019, but he is not in a payment plan for the delinquencies.
(Item 3) Applicant stated in that same interrogatory that he was in a payment plan  with
one state for tax years 2015 and 2016, but did not provide any details of the payments.
(Item 3) He is not in a payment plan for the other state. He has not started a payment
plan with the IRS. (Item 3)
In Applicant’s 2019 subject interview, he noted that he is self-employed and travels
abroad as part of his freelance business. He also explained the financial hardship which
caused the bankruptcy. He admits that he owes about $260,000, including interest and
penalty to the IRS. He stated that he intended to establish a payment plan with the IRS
in the next week after his subject interview. There is no evidence of a plan in place in this
record. He also stated that he just does not have the funds. (Item 3) He has a budget and
has a monthly net income of $5,800. He does not have a dedicated savings account. He
uses any extra money to bring his mortgage current.
As to  SOR 1.a  and  1.b,  and  1.c, Applicant admits that he  has unpaid  federal taxes
for  the   years  in  question,  which  total  approximately   $101,328.15.   He  submitted   IRS
transcripts  to confirm the amount.  He is still not in a repayment plan.
As to SOR 1.d, Applicant has set up a payment plan for his delinquent state taxes
(Item 2) with the other state. He pays $500 per month. He submitted documentation that
indicates he has paid $500 a month since 2018 for tax year 2016. It appears that there is
a $24,413 balance. (Item 3)
