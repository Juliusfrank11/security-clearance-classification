Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 40 years old. A 1999 high school graduate, Applicant has taken some
college classes, but has not earned a college degree. He served in the U.S. military on
active duty from 1999 – 2005, was honorably discharged, and affiliated with the Reserve
in 2007. In the Reserve, Applicant has mobilized on at least five occasions, including for
a 2007 – 2008 deployment to Iraq. At the time of his background interview in April 2016,
Applicant was still serving in the Reserve. (Items 3 and 8) Applicant is twice divorced. He
married for the first time in 2000 and divorced in 2004. He married for the second time in
2004 and divorced in 2014; he has a 16 year-old son from his second marriage. (Item 3)
Applicant reports one period of unemployment, from June 2005 – June 2006, after
his discharge from active duty and while he was a student. When he rejoined the work
force in 2006, he initially worked as a security officer for a private contractor and then as
a police officer for a municipality. From October 2007 through October 2012, Applicant
was continuously mobilized. After his most recent mobilization ended in 2012, Applicant
worked  first  as  a  police  officer  onboard  a  military  installation  and  subsequently  as  a
security officer for three contractors; he is currently sponsored by a federal contractor as
a security officer. (Item 3)
In September 2015, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA).
In Section 26: Delinquency Involving Enforcement, Applicant disclosed a relatively minor
child-support arrearage. In Section 26: Delinquency Involving Routine Accounts, the SCA
asked if, in the past seven years, Applicant had any bills or debts that were turned over
to  a  collection  agency;  had  any  account  or  credit  card  suspended,  charged  off,  or
cancelled; or, had any financial obligations that were over 120 days delinquent. Applicant
responded “no” to the inquiry. (Item 3)
The  SOR  alleges  six  debts  that  accumulated  from  approximately  2014  to  2016
(SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.f).  Additionally,  the  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  filed  for  Chapter  13
bankruptcy in July 2016, that it was dismissed in May 2017, and that five additional debts
included in the bankruptcy remain unpaid (SOR ¶¶ 1.g(1)-1.g(5)). Combined, the eleven
alleged delinquencies total approximately $71,851 and include credit-card debts totaling
$18,692,  an  automobile-loan  deficiency  of  $21,101,  a  motorcycle-loan  deficiency  of
$7,796, and a recreational-vehicle loan deficiency of $11,240. Finally, SOR ¶ 2.a alleges
that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose five specific debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.g(3),
1.g(4), and 1.g(5)) when he completed his SCA. (Item 1) These were slightly older debts
that were already delinquent, charged off, or in collections when Applicant completed the
SCA; the other debts alleged became delinquent following completion of the SCA. (Item
4-6)
The  allegations  are  established  by  Applicant’s  admissions,  credit  reports,  the
bankruptcy trustee’s Final Report, and the summary of Applicant’s background interview.
(Items 2, 4-8) Applicant attributes his financial problems to a bitter divorce and insufficient
income. (Item 2)
During Applicant’s April 2016 background interview, the government investigator
asked Applicant if he was delinquent on any accounts. Applicant confirmed that he was
delinquent on his child-support obligations and volunteered that he was also delinquent
on  a  Military  Star  card  account,  but  volunteered  no  other  delinquencies.  (Item  8)  The
investigator then confronted Applicant with the delinquent debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e,
1.f,  1.g(3),  1.g(4),  and  1.g(5).  Applicant  acknowledged  all  five  debts,  admitted  that  he
knew  each  was  delinquent,  and  confirmed  that  creditors  and  collection  agencies  had
contacted  him  about  the  delinquencies.  He  asserted  that  his  failure  to  disclose  the
delinquent debts on his SCA was due to an oversight. (Item 8) Given the totality of the
circumstances,  I  find  that  Applicant’s  failure  to  disclose  the  debts  on  his  SCA  was
deliberate, as he was familiar with the debts when confronted, spoke in detail with the
investigator about each account, and admitted that collection agencies and creditors had
been attempting to contact him. (Item 8)
At the close of his interview, Applicant stated his intent to get a second job in the
summer of 2016 and to clear the debts by the end of 2016. (Item 8) In July 2016, Applicant
instead filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy; it was dismissed for a failure to perform in May
2017. (Item 7)
In  Applicant’s June  2018  answer to  the SOR,  he notes that the debts alleged at
SOR  ¶¶  1.b.  and  1.c.  are  the  same  delinquency.  (Item  2)  The  credit  reports  support
Applicant’s assertion, and I find for the Applicant on SOR ¶ 1.c. (Items 4, 5, and 6) The
remaining ten delinquencies total $60,891. In explanation for his debts, Applicant states
that he  “fell on  hard times between  the  years 2014  –  2016  due  to a  bitter divorce,” but
that he is “back on my feet now.” (Item 2) Applicant provided no information on any action
he  may  have  taken  to  repay  the  debts  and  provided  no  explanation  for  his  failure  to
disclose delinquencies on his SCA. (Item 2)
