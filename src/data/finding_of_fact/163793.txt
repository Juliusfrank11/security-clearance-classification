Applicant was unemployed from 2012 until she started her current job in August
2015. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in October 2014. Her elderly mother came
to  live  with  her  at  about  the  same  time.  Applicant  had  an  operation  and  additional
procedures,  and  her  husband  had  back  surgery  in  2015.  Her  mother  passed  away  in
2015.  Applicant  helped  her  sister  who  had  mental  health  issues.  With  everything
happening,  which  included  related  financial  problems,  Applicant  and  her  husband  did
not file their federal tax return for tax year 2014. She “let it get away from [her],” and tax
returns  for  2014  and  subsequent  tax  years  have  never  been  filed.  (Tr.  at  17-21;

Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
July 2017. She reported that she and her husband did not file federal tax returns for tax
years 2014 through 2016. She indicated that there should not be any taxes owed, and
that they were “working on getting [the returns] filed with a tax professional.” In response
to  DOHA  interrogatories  in  September  2019,  she  wrote:  “My  returns  are  not  yet
completed. It could be another 2 to 3 weeks.” Applicant responded to the SOR in March
2020.  She  wrote  that  “[t]hings  definitely  got  out  of  hand  [and  they  were]  trying  to  get
caught up.” (GE 1, 3)
Applicant and her husband have not filed any of their federal tax returns for 2014
through 2020. She indicated they could not afford the tax professional’s fees to prepare
their  returns  all  at  once.  They  planned  to  pay  the  professional to  prepare  and  file  one
tax return per month, starting about a month after the hearing. (Tr. at 18-22; Applicant’s
