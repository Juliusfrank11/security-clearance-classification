In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied, with brief comments, all of the factual
allegations  pertaining  to  financial  considerations  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  and  1.b.).  Applicant’s
comments are incorporated herein to compare with my findings of fact. After a complete
and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same,
I make the following findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving
with her current employer as a claims customer services advocate or claims associate
since  December  2006.  At  times,  she  has  also  been  a  part-time  employee  of  other
commercial stores. The recipient of a General Educational Development (GED) diploma
in 1989,  she  received  an  associate’s degree  in 2003  and  a  bachelor’s degree  in  2005.
She has never served with the U.S. military. She was married in 1994 and divorced in
2000. She remarried in 2000 and divorced in 2006. She remarried in 2009 and separated
in 2009. The actual legal status of her most recent marital relationship is not known  to
her. She has two children, born in 1989 and 1991.
Financial Considerations
Applicant failed  to  timely  file  her  federal and  state  income  tax  returns for  the  tax
years 2017 and  2018.  On  June  25, 2018, she  was interviewed  by  an  investigator with  the
U.S. Office of  Personnel Management (OPM). During  that interview, she  admitted  that
she  failed   to   timely   file   her 2017   income  tax   returns,   essentially   claiming   that  she   was
unable to  do  so  because  she  could not  find  the  paperwork to  enable  her to  itemize  her
medical bills and  student loans.  She  added  that her employer was laying  off  employees
and   because   of   the   uncertainty   of   her  own   job,  she   simply   set  her  taxes  aside.  After
missing  the  filing  deadline  for the  2017  income  tax  returns,  she  became  nervous about
filing  the  2018  income  tax  returns.  She  subsequently  learned  that her failure to  file  the
income  tax  returns for an  earlier year did not prevent her from  filing  the  tax  returns for
later  years.  She   planned   on   completing   her  trustworthiness   eligibility   process  before
taking  on  her income  tax  issues, but intended  to  file  her  income  tax  returns within 90  days.
(GE 2, at 5, 10)  As of  February  11, 2020, she  had  still  not filed  her delinquent income  tax
returns. (GE 2, at 10)
Using  the  professional  services  of  a  tax  return  preparation  service,  Applicant
electronically filed her federal and state income tax returns for 2018 on April 27, 2020,
three days after the SOR was issued. (AE A; AE B) Her federal income tax return for 2017
was electronically filed the following day, four days after the SOR was issued; and the
state income tax return was electronically filed on April 29, 2020, five days after the SOR
was issued. (AE A; AE B)
