In her SOR answer, Applicant admitted all but one of the allegations (denied SOR
1.d, as a duplicate debt), with explanations. Her admissions are adopted as findings of
fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings
of fact.
Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She began working
at  her  present  job,  a  production  line  supervisor,  in  December  2016.  She  previously
worked  for  this  same  employer  from  2008  to  2010,  but  was  dismissed  because  of  a
positive drug test. (I have not used this information for disqualification purposes because
it was not alleged in the SOR.) She experienced periods of unemployment from May 2010
to July 2011, December 2013 to May 2015, and September 2015 to December 2016. She
married in 2015. She has three children, ages 25, 23, and 8. She claimed that many of
her accrued debts arose when she was a single mother. She previously held a security
clearance and has never had a security violation. (Tr. 6, 19-23, 31-32 GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  eight  collection  accounts  and  one  charged-off  debt  (medical
debts,  apartment  rent  debts,  utility  debts,  a  car  repossession,  and  consumer  debts)
totaling approximately $23,088. The debts are established by credit reports from August
2018, May 2019, and December 2019; Applicant’s personal subject interview (PSI) with
a defense investigator in August 2018; and her SOR admissions. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 11p) (GE
2-5; Answer to SOR)
Applicant explained  that her  financial issues  began  when  she was a  single mother
and she  was involved  in  an  abusive  relationship which caused  her to  have  to  vacate  her
apartment  before   the   end   of   her  lease   term.  Her  periods  of  unemployment  also
contributed   to   her  financial  problems.   Her  husband   lost   his  job   in  2020   due   to   the
pandemic,  which also contributed  to  their  financial distress.  She  admitted  that she  was
also  foolish  with  her finances  and did not  understand  how  delinquent debts  could  impact
her job. She  hired a debt repair company  (DRC)  to clean up her  credit report. She stated
that the  DRC  did not assist with  paying  her debts,  but it did help repair  her credit report
and  it offered  her some  strategies on  how  to  address her delinquent debts.  (Tr. 19, 31-
33, 37-38)
The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
SOR ¶  1.a-$1,152. Applicant incurred this medical debt in 2013. She presented
documentation showing this debt was paid in November 2020. This debt is resolved. (Tr.
24; AE E)
SOR  ¶¶   1.b   and  1.c-$7,211   each.   Applicant  claims  that  these  two  debts  are
duplicates arising out of the same transaction. A credit report supports her assertion. SOR
¶  1.c  is  found  in  favor  of  Applicant.  This  debt  resulted  when  Applicant  vacated  her
apartment before the end of her lease in order to escape an abusive relationship. She
claimed she entered a payment arrangement with the creditor. She stated that she could
provide  supporting  documentation  showing  her  payments  since  March  2020.  She  was
given until July 30 from the date of  the hearing to provide this documentation, but  she
failed  to  do  so.  Her  post-hearing  submissions  do  not  address  this  debt.  This  debt  is
unresolved. (Tr. 26-27; GE 3; AE C-E)
SOR  ¶   1.d-$3,248.  Applicant  incurred   this  repossession   debt   in   approximately
2012, which became  delinquent in approximately  2014.  She  claimed  she  entered  into  a
payment   arrangement   with   the   creditor.  She   stated   that   she   could   provide   supporting
documentation  showing  her $161  payments  for the  last  six  months. She  was given  until
July  30  from  the  date  of  hearing  to  provide  this documentation,  but  she  failed  to  do  so.
Her post-hearing  submissions do not address  this debt. This debt is unresolved.  (Tr. 27-
28; GE 3; AE C-E)
SOR  ¶   1.e-$886.   Applicant  incurred   this  consumer  debt  in  approximately   2013.
She   claims  this  debt  was  paid  and   she   would  provide   supporting   documentation.  She
documented  a  $250  payment  to  settle  this debt.  This debt is  resolved.  (Tr.  29; GE  3;  AE
C)
SOR  ¶   1.f-$2,281.   Applicant
in
approximately  2012. Applicant  claimed  she  paid this debt and  could provide  supporting
documentation. The   document  she   provided   does  not  address  the   SOR  debt,   rather it
shows  a   payment  to   a   different  telecommunication   company   in  December  2020   for
approximately $166.  This debt is unresolved.  (Tr. 30; GE 3; AE  E)

Applicant testified that she and her husband now have a monthly net income of
approximately  $6,000.  They  are  working  toward  purchasing  a  home.  Her  most  recent
credit report shows no other delinquencies. She has approximately $120 in savings. She
also is current on a bank loan with payments of $161 every two weeks. (Tr. 34-36; AE A,
D)
Applicant provided a letter from a work colleague who has worked with her since
2015. He described Applicant as a trustworthy and ethical professional. He recommends
her for a security clearance. (AE B)
