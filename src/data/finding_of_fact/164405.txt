Applicant  is  51  years  old  and  divorced,  with  three  children.  He  currently  has  a
cohabitant. He has a Bachelor of Science degree. Applicant retired from the Marine Corps
as  a  lieutenant  colonel  (O-5)  in  2016.  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  a  defense
contractor  as  a  senior  principal  training  specialist  since  2016.  He  is  seeking  to  retain
national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment.
(Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, and 17; Applicant Exhibit A at 2-3; Tr. 17-21.)

The SOR alleged that Applicant had three past-due or charged-off debts, including
a past-due mortgage. The total amount of the past-due indebtedness was approximately
$78,118 as of the date of the SOR. Applicant admitted all three allegations in the SOR
with  explanations.  The  existence  and  amount  of  indebtedness  is  supported  by  credit
reports in the record dated May 18, 2018; February 19, 2020; and February 28, 2021.
(Government Exhibits 4, 3, and 2.)
Applicant’s financial issues had  their  genesis  in the  year 2016. Applicant and  his
wife divorced in  October of  that year. His ex-wife and children live in the United  States in
the  family  home.  The  divorce decree  is found  at  Applicant  Exhibit A  on  pages 6  through
26.  The   divorce  resulted   in  continuing   child   support  payments  that  Applicant  was
obligated  to  meet. In  addition, there  were other expenses connected  to  his  children  and
his ex-wife  that he  has continued  to cover to the present. (Tr. 46, 51, 57-58.)
As stated, Applicant was a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps. At the time he
retired in June 2016 he was stationed in a foreign country (FC). Applicant elected to stay
in FC after he retired because he was in a relationship. He had difficulties finding a job
and  was  unemployed  for  several  months.  Applicant  began  working  with  his  current
employer in December 2016. (Tr. 24.)
Applicant has been living with a cohabitant in FC since approximately August 2016.
In the beginning she would pay the expenses for their living arrangements because she
made more money than Applicant. At some point his partner began making less money
than he did and Applicant  chose to take over paying the majority of expenses for their
living arrangement. (Tr. 29-31, 55-57.)
The current status of the debts alleged in the SOR is as follows:
1.a. Applicant admitted  owing  a  mortgage  lender approximately  $51,842  for a  past-
due   mortgage.  Applicant   purchased   this  house   in   2013   when   he   was  stationed   in   the
United  States. As  stated, Applicant and  his wife  divorced  in 2016.   She   and  Applicant’s
three  children  continue  to  live  in the  house, though  they  hope  to  move  soon. The  divorce
decree  states that Applicant and  his wife  agreed  that he  would pay  the  mortgage  on  the
marital house   for  three   years  after the   divorce  was  final   in  lieu   of  alimony.   Applicant’s
Answer and  testimony  are wrong  on  this point. At that time  the  property  would be  listed
for sale if  both  parties  agreed. Until  such  time  as the  property  was sold Applicant was
responsible  for the  mortgage.  Applicant was not  able  to  fulfill the  terms of  this agreement.
He stopped  paying  the  mortgage  in 2018.  As of  the  date  of the  most  recent  credit report
in the  record,  February  28, 2021,  the  delinquency  had  risen  to  $88,735.  The  mortgage
company  had  also  started  foreclosure  proceedings. Applicant  has not made  any  recent
payments on  this debt,  and  has no  plans  to  make  payments on  this debt.  It  is not resolved.
(Government Exhibit 2  at 3; Applicant Exhibit A  at 12,  18-20; Tr. 25-29, 31-38.)
1.b. Applicant admitted  owing  approximately  $18,969 for a  delinquent credit card.
Applicant used  this card  to  pay  bills immediately  after he  left  the  Marine  Corps. Applicant
has not made  any  recent payments on  this debt and  has no plans to make payments on
this debt.  It is not resolved. (Government Exhibit 2  at 4; Tr. 40. 44-47.)
1.c.   Applicant   admitted   owing   approximately   $7,307   for  a   separate   delinquent
credit card.  The  most recent  credit report in  the  record  indicates that Applicant  appears
to have two accounts with this bank. One, account number 44171219, has a charged-off
balance of $7,307. The  second, account  number  42668415,  is not  past due, but  is being
paid under a  partial payment arrangement. (Government Exhibit 2  at 4-5.)
Applicant’s  evidence  was  confusing  about  this  particular  charged-off  debt.  He
maintained that he had paid this particular debt off and was surprised to find out that he
still owed  money on  it.  Applicant further stated  that  he  talked  to his  spouse  about  this
debt,  but  she  did  not  “respond  definitively”  as  to  whether  or  not  she  used  the  card.
Applicant submitted documentation from his bank showing that he is making payments to
credit cards with this bank since October 2020. He has made fifteen payments in amounts
ranging from $94 to $188. However, the records do not show how the payments are being
applied. Based on the state of the record, I cannot find that this debt is being resolved.
