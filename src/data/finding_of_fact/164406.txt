Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 56 years old and has worked for a defense contractor as an assembler
since August 2018. He married in 2002 and divorced in 2007. He has two adult children,
ages  29  and  32.  He  earned  a  high  school  diploma  and  has  taken  some  college  and
technical school courses. (Tr. at 29.)
From 2007 until 2018, Applicant was self-employed as a delivery driver contractor,
driving hundreds of miles every day. He lost his delivery contract twice, once in 2010 and
again in 2015 or 2016. From about 2016 to 2018, he was unemployed and experienced
serious financial difficulties. Since becoming employed full time as a W-2 employee, he
has been able to stabilize his financial situation. He also works part time in another field
as a 1099 employee to make a little extra income. He is a first-time applicant for a security
clearance. (Tr. at 31-37, 49-50, 68-69.)
SOR Allegations
Paragraph  1,  Guideline  F  - The  SOR  sets  forth  seven  allegations  regarding
Applicant’s failures to pay his federal tax liabilities, one delinquent education loan, and
five past-due consumer debts. The SOR Amendment adds an eighth allegation regarding
an additional tax year (TY) with a federal tax liability.
The details regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:
1.a  Failure  to  pay  federal income  taxes  in the  amount  of  about  $1,206  –  The
SOR alleges that Applicant owes delinquent taxes to the IRS in the amount of $1,206 for
TYs 2012-2017. In his Answer, Applicant denied this allegation and wrote that he paid off
the tax debts for the years 2012-2016 through a payment plan ending in November 2018.
After the hearing, Applicant provided an IRS Account Summary, dated August 16, 2021,
reflecting a zero balance on his taxes for TYs 2011-2020. These tax debts have been
resolved. (Answer;  AE F.)
1.b Car  loan  charged off in the  amount  of  about  $5,937  –  Applicant denied this
debt in his Answer. He wrote that the lender involuntarily repossessed his car and resold
it. He disputes the amount the lender claims is owed. He testified that this amount is what
he owed the lender when it repossessed the car in 2015 after he defaulted on paying the
loan. He argues that he should only owe the loan balance after the resale of the car. This
account was opened in 2010, and he paid the loan for about five years. He tried to settle
the debt with an installment payment plan, but the lender refused. The lender would only
accept  a  lump-sum  payment  of  the  debt,  which  Applicant  could  not  afford.  Applicant
described the current status of this debt as in “limbo.” This debt is not resolved. (Answer;
Tr. at 38-41; GE 4 at 1-2; GE 5 at 4.)
1.c  Collection account  in the  amount  of  about   $3,320  –  Applicant denied this
debt  in  his  Answer.  He  wrote  that  he  attempted  to  enter  into  a  payment  plan  with  the
collection agency, but his offer was rejected. The creditor insists on a lump-sum payment
in full. The debt is a  “pay-day”  loan,  which Applicant opened  in 2016  in the amount of
$3,400 during his period of “hardship” without a contract, and he could not afford to repay
the  loan.  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  did  not  believe  he  had  made  any
payments on this debt. He was mistaken at that time. One of his post-hearing exhibits
lists payments in a total amount of $1,501, or almost one-half of this debt. This debt is
partially resolved. (Answer; Tr. at 41-44; AE D; GE 3 at 1; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 4.)
1.d Education  loan  in  default  in the  amount  of  about  $2,228  –  This loan was
opened in about 2010,  and Applicant defaulted on its  repayment in about 2014.  In  his
Answer,  Applicant  denied  this  debt.  He  wrote  that  the  loan  was  for  his  daughter’s
education in a technical school.  She never was able to graduate because of fraud on the
part of the school. He wrote further that his daughter has been advised that neither she
nor Applicant as the co-signer on the loan have to repay this student loan because of the
school’s fraud. He believes that the school was sued for fraud and the settlement relieved
all  students  with  education  loans  paid  to  the  school  of  any  responsibility  to  repay  the
loans, even if the loans had been assigned to the U.S. Department of Education (DOE)
for collection. Applicant has no documentation to support his understanding on the current
status of this loan. His child is presently homeless and has no documentation regarding
the loan. The debt remains on Applicant’s most recent credit report in the record, dated
March 11, 2021. This debt is not resolved. (Answer; Tr. at 44-47; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 2;
GE 5 at 5.)
1.e  Collection account  in the  amount  of  about  $1,071  – This debt is owed to a
cellphone service provider. Applicant defaulted on the monthly payments in about  2015
or 2016. In his Answer, Applicant denied the debt and wrote that he contacted the creditor
and offered to repay the debt in installments. He was refused because the creditor insisted
on being paid one-lump sum.The creditor was willing to accept a lump-sum payment for
less than the full amount, but Applicant could not afford to pay the reduced amount.  This
debt is not resolved. (Answer; Tr. at 48-50; GE 4 at 2.)
1.f Charged-off account in the amount of about $444  – Applicant admitted this
debt in his Answer and commented that he has been unable to repay this debt due to his
limited  income.  This  account  is  another  “pay-day”  loan.  In  October  2015,  Applicant
borrowed $600 to pay for his living expenses when he was unemployed. AE A lists six
payments  totaling  about  $1,690.  Most  of  these  payments  were  for  interest  or  other
charges and were made in 2015 and 2016. Applicant still has a balance to pay. This debt
is not resolved. (Answer; Tr at 50-57; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 5.)
1.g Collection account   in the  amount  of   about  $559 –  Applicant opened this
account  with  an  internet/cable  TV  provider.  The  creditor  claims  he  did  not  return  the
company’s equipment. He admitted the debt in his Answer and wrote that he has been
unable to pay this debt due to his limited income. At the hearing, he testified that he had
returned the equipment when he moved and discontinued the service. He also testified
that the debt included the last month of service by the provider. He has not contacted the
creditor to settle this account. This debt is not resolved. (Answer; Tr at 57-59; GE 5 at 8.)
1.h Failure  to  pay  Federal taxes  for TY  2019  in the  amount  of  about  $1,066  –
Applicant admitted this debt in his Answer to Amendment and noted that he entered into
an installment agreement with the IRS in October 2020 to pay this tax debt. He submitted
a document with his 2019 IRS statement, reflecting a balance of $333.14 for TY 2019.
Applicant has also filed his 2020 federal tax return, and his TY 2020 tax is fully paid. As
noted above, he submitted after the hearing an updated IRS Account Summary, which
reflects  that  he  has  a zero  balance for TYs 2011-2020.  Applicant has resolved  his TY
2019 tax debt. (Amendment to Answer at 1, 3-4; AE E; AE F.)
Applicant’s  employer  does  not  offer  financial  counseling  to  its  employees,  and
Applicant has not received any counseling. He was raised in a “financially-disabled home”
and has never had the opportunity to be educated in financial matters. He merely lives
paycheck  to  paycheck.  He  has  considered  the  possibility  of  working  with  debt-
consolidation or credit-repair companies. He has decided, however, that it would be better
to try to make installment payment plans directly with his creditors. He wants to purchase
a home, and he knows he needs to fix his credit to be able to do that.  He is afraid that if
he  consolidates  his  debts  or  files  for  bankruptcy,  he  will  not  be  able  to  qualify  for  a
mortgage to buy a home. Even though he has some unresolved debts, he believes he is
an honest person who tries to do the right thing. (Tr. at 50, 59-62, 74.)
Applicant’s current monthly take-home pay is about $2,800. He shares his living
expenses  equally  with  his  girlfriend/cohabitant.  Their  rent  is  $2,300.  His  girlfriend  has
three children who live with them. His  monthly car payment is $325. The car is almost
paid off. He does not provide any support for his adult children. He has about $600 left
over every month after all of his basic living expenses. He has no savings. He believes
he can resolve all of his outstanding debts if he was given the opportunity to make monthly
payments. (Tr. at 61-67.)
