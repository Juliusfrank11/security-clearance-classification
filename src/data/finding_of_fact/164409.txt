Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, through 1.f. He denied SOR
allegations  ¶¶  1.a.  and  1.b.,  with  explanations.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of
the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  43-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX 1  at  page  7.)
He  has  been  employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  2020.  (TR  at  page  13  lines
14~21.) Applicant is separated from his spouse “since 2013,” is pending a divorce, and
has  three  children.  (TR  at  page  14  line  5  to  page  15  line  14.)  He was  unemployed  or
underemployed  from  2005~2020.  Applicant  attributes  his  financial  difficulties  to  his
separation and pending divorce, and to his 15 years of deficient employment. (TR at 16
line 20 to page 17 line 20.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a.  and   1.b.  Applicant  is  current  with   Federal  and   state   income   tax   filings,  as
evidenced  by  copies of those  filings. (TR at  page  15  line  15  to  page  16  line  16, at page
33 line 17  to  page 34 line 18, and AppXs A, B, E and F.)
1.c.  Through  the  auspices of  a  tax  relief  firm,  Applicant’s  past tax  delinquencies
have  been  placed   in a   “Currently   Not  Collectable Status  (CNC),”   and  he   is required  to
use  3% of his net  monthly  income  as  payments to  the  Internal Revenue  Service (IRS).
(TR at page  17  line  21  to  page  20  line  13, and  AppXs B  and  G.) Through  this process,
Applicant’s  tax   debt   to   the   IRS   has  been   reduced   to   $12,732.00,  as  evidenced   by
documentation  from  his tax relief  firm. (AppX  G.)
1.d.  Applicant’s  past-due   debt   to   Creditor  D  is  “paid  in  full,”  as  evidenced   by   a
letter from Creditor D. (TR at page  23 line 24 to page  26 line 13, and  AppX I.)
1.e.  Applicant’s  past-due  debt to  Creditor  E  has a  “Balance  $0.00,”  as  evidenced
by  letters from  Creditor E. (TR at page  26  line  14  to  page  28  line  14, and  AppXs C and
H.)
1.f.  Through  the  auspices  of  legal  counsel,  Applicant  has  made  a  reasonable
settlement offer to Creditor E vis-à-vis his $5,424 past-due car lease debt. Through this
offer,  Applicant  agrees  to  make  two  $500  payments,  and  monthly  payments  of  $150
thereafter  “until  [the  debt  is]  paid.” (TR at  page  28  line  15  to  page  29  line  19). This is
evidenced by a letter of offer to Creditor E. (AppX J.) I find this to be a good-faith effort
to address this admitted past-due debt.
