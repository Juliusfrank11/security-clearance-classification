In  Applicant’s  answer,  he  admitted  the  Guideline  H  allegations,  but  denied  the
Guideline E allegations. I adopt his admissions as findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  32  years  old.  He  is  single,  never  married,  and  has  no  children.  He
holds  a  master’s  degree.  Applicant  started  working  for  his  current  federal  contractor-
employer  in  November  2019  as  an  engineer.  He  previously  worked  for  a  federal
contractor from April 2011 to August 2018. Between August 2018 and November 2019,
he  worked for a non-federal contractor.  He was  granted  a secret security clearance in
2011 and 2016. (Items 3, 7)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from
approximately 2010 until May 2020; that he used marijuana with varying frequency from
approximately  June  2011  until  May  2020,  after  he  was  granted  access  to  classified
information; and that he used Ecstasy once in April 2020, after he was granted access to
classified  information. The  SOR also alleged that Applicant falsified  his answers when
completing his security clearance applications (SCA) in April 2011 and March 2016, when
he failed to disclose his marijuana use within the last seven years on those SCAs.
Applicant acknowledged that he used all the illegal substances alleged in the SOR
and at times when he held a security clearance. He denied deliberately making any false
statements when completing his 2011 and 2016 SCAs. (Items 2, 4 (section II, Drug Use,
question 1))
Applicant first used marijuana in 2010. He claims this use was in a country where
it was legal at the time of his use. Between 2018 and 2020 he used marijuana by smoking
it using a vape pen and eating edibles approximately 25 times. His last use of marijuana
was in May 2020. His use was with his roommate, who also provided the marijuana. He
claims  these  uses  were  all  in  states  that  legalized  marijuana  under  state  law.  He
acknowledged knowing marijuana use is illegal under federal law. He used Ecstasy one
time in April 2020. He used Ecstasy with his roommate and three other acquaintances.
He ingested it by drinking it in a powder form. He stated that he does not intend to use
either marijuana or Ecstasy in the future. He did not provide any information on whether
he still has contacts with the roommate and acquaintances he described above. He first
held a security clearance in 2011 and more recently has held a clearance since 2016.
(Items 2, 4, 7)
Applicant completed a SCA in April 2011. In response to a question asking about
his  illegal  drug  use  in  the  past  seven  years,  he  answered  in  the  negative.  Applicant
asserts that his only marijuana use at that point in time was in 2010 while he was visiting
a foreign country where such use was legal. He believes his answer to this SCA question
was not false because he did not engage in “illegal” drug usage, since it was legal under
the laws of the country where he used it. (Items 2, 6)
Applicant  completed  a  second  SCA  in  March  2016.  In  response  to  a  question
asking about his illegal drug use in the past seven years, he answered in the negative.
Applicant never really asserted a  reason  why  he  answered  “no” to  this question, other
than explaining his use in a foreign country in 2010 and asserting that the question was
confusing to him. He also pointed out that in his most recent SCA (July 2020) he listed all
of his illegal drug usage. (Items 2, 3, 5)
