Applicant  is  a  57-year-old  operations  manager,  employed  by  a  government
contractor since November 2016. He was unemployed from July to September 2009, and
from August to November 2016. He graduated from high school in 1982 and joined the
U.S.  Army  Reserve  while  in  high  school,  and  remained  until  he  was  discharged  in
November 1982 to join the U.S. Marine Corps. He served on active duty in the Marine
Corps from December 1982 to December 1986, when he was honorably discharged. He
has been married since 1987 and has one child and one stepchild. Applicant’s security
clearance was previously suspended in 1984 due to a court-martial proceeding while he
was  on  active  duty.  He  was  last  granted  a  security  clearance  by  the  Department  of
Homeland Security in 2015.
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant has 13 delinquent debts totaling
approximately  $61,225.  One  account  is  a  medical  collection,  while  the  remaining
delinquencies are consumer debts in collection or charged off. Applicant admitted all of
the SOR allegations, with explanations.
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he had health problems over the
past  few  years,  including  receiving  a  pacemaker  in  April  2020  that  caused  him  to  fall
behind on his debts. He noted in his SCA that he was out of work due to major surgery
and  rehabilitation  for 90  days,  and  his  work  hours  were  reduced.  He  is  also  providing
financial support to his daughter and granddaughter. In his SCA, Applicant listed a 2011
judgment and wage garnishment for a vehicle loan debt after a repossession, and other
unresolved debts that arose due to “medical issues [that] have led to my poor financial
status.”  (GE  3)  Applicant’s  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  indicates  three  other
judgments from 2019 on accounts listed as SOR ¶¶ 1.c – 1.e, and 1.g – 1.h. (GE 4) His
2020 credit bureau report shows his SOR debts date between 2014 and 2020. (GE 5)
Applicant planned to file a petition in bankruptcy, but was unable to do so in 2020
due to pandemic-related court access restrictions. He noted in his January 2021 Answer
that the bankruptcy court reopened to the public “a few weeks ago.” To date, Applicant
has not provided any evidence that he filed bankruptcy, or that he has taken any  other
action to resolve his debts. He notes that he continues to perform his job “at a high level”
and that his debts will not cause him to be compromised.
According to Applicant’s June 2020 PSI, Applicant has a monthly net remainder of
$342 after paying his expenses. Applicant’s spouse is disabled and receives a disability
income that is separate from his finances. Applicant and his spouse do not discuss their
finances  with  each  other.  No  evidence  of  financial  counseling  or  Applicant’s  current
financial status was included in the record.
