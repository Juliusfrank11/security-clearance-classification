Applicant worked for defense contractors for years, working mostly overseas until
he was laid off in late 2012. He was out of work for about five to six months in 2013. He
bought  a  business  for  $670,000.  He  made  a  down  payment  of  $225,000,  which  he
withdrew  from  his  401(k)  retirement  account,  and  then  he  was  supposed  to  make
monthly $8,000 payments until the remaining $445,000 was paid. (Tr. at 17-18, 26-29;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 6)
The  business  was  not  as  successful  as  Applicant  was  led  to  believe.  He
renegotiated the sales contract with the previous owner for another $200,000 lump-sum
payment  in  2014  and  a  final  $25,000  payment  in  2015.  Applicant  made  the  $200,000
payment,  which  he  again  withdrew  from  his  401(k)  retirement  account.  (Tr.  at  18;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 6)
Applicant discovered the previous owner was doing business under a name that
was  similar  to  Applicant’s  business  in  violation  of  a  non-compete  clause  in  the  sales
contract.  Applicant  believes  that  his  salesman  conspired  with  the  previous  owner  to
significantly underbid contracts, which left Applicant’s business losing about $10,000 to
$12,000  per month. Applicant used  his personal credit to  pay the  company’s bills. The
business was ultimately unsuccessful, and Applicant closed it in 2015. (Tr. at 17-18, 21;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 6)
The previous owner sued Applicant for the remaining money owed on the sales
contract, and Applicant  countersued for breach  of  contract.  In January 2020, the court
dismissed  Applicant’s  countersuit  for  violating  the  court’s  discovery  order.  Applicant
testified that the lawsuit is still pending. (Tr. at 19, 54; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE

Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in March 2016. The case was closed
in  August  2016.  He  stated  that  his  bankruptcy  attorney  made  mistakes  in  how  the
bankruptcy  was  filed.  Applicant  filed  another  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  case  in  January
2017. Under Schedule D, Creditors Who Have Claims Secured by Property, the petition
listed claims totaling $319,000, which included three mortgage loans totaling $240,000;
a $39,000 auto loan; and $40,000 owed on a boat valued at $107,600. Under Schedule
E/F,  Creditors  Who  Have  Unsecured  Claims,  the  petition  listed  $30,000  in  taxes  as
priority claims and $202,326 in nonpriority claims. Applicant’s attorney filed a motion to
convert the case to a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. The former owner of  the business, as a
creditor, objected to the motion. After additional motions and filings, the case was never
converted  and  the  bankruptcy  was  dismissed  in  May  2018.  Applicant  stated  that  the
bankruptcy was dismissed because his income was higher than permitted for a Chapter
7 bankruptcy. (Tr. at 18-20, 40-42, 44-49; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 7, 8)
Applicant  sold  the  boat  in  2015.  The  loan  was  still  reported  in  the  bankruptcy
because  Applicant  carried  the  loan  until  the  purchaser  paid  off  the  boat.  Applicant’s
taxes have been paid. (Tr. at 30, 49-52; AE I, M; GE 6)
The  SOR  alleges  the two  bankruptcy cases, an  unpaid  $962  judgment,  and  six
delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $73,800.  The  $962  judgment  was  against  Applicant
personally  and  a  company  operating  under  the  name  of  Applicant’s  business.  It  is
unclear  if  the  co-defendant  was  Applicant’s  company,  the  company  before  it  was
purchased by Applicant, or the company operated by the previous owner with the same
or  similar  name  after  the  original  business  was  sold.  Applicant  denied  the  allegations,
claiming that the debts were incurred for his company. He admitted that he was at least
a cosigner for the debts. The judgment is established by a court record. The debts are
established by credit reports and Applicant’s admissions. The credit reports list the SOR
debts as individual accounts. (Tr. at 19-21, 32-33, 38-39; Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 2-6)
Applicant  reached  a  settlement  agreement  with  the  creditor  for  the  SOR  ¶  1.f
debt in April 2021. It is alleged as a charged-off debt of $15,571, but the actual balance
was  $22,461.  Applicant  agreed  to  pay  $655  per  month  for  12  months  for  a  total  of
$7,861 in settlement of the debt. He documented the four required payments from May
2021 through August 2021. (Tr. at 36-37; Applicant’s response  to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A,
B, G)
In  March  2021,  Applicant  received  a  settlement  offer from  a  creditor for a  past-
due $2,797 debt that was not alleged in the SOR. He paid $1,160 to settle the debt in
May 2021. (Tr. at 43-44; AE C, H)
Applicant  has  been  steadily  employed  by  defense  contractors  since  December
2015. He stated that his finances were good before he bought the business, and he has
paid  his  current  bills  since  he  closed  the  business.  He  has  taken  financial  courses
online. He maintains a budget.  He is working overseas and making a good salary. He
has  not  made  any  other  payments  toward  his  delinquent  debts.  He  stated  that  he
contacted the  creditors  after his bankruptcy was  dismissed. Some of  the  creditors told
him the debts were old and charged off and they were no longer collecting them. Other
creditors  wanted  a  lump-sum  payment  or  more  than  he  could  afford  in  monthly
payments. He stated that he planned to pay the creditors who are willing to talk to him
one  at  a  time  until  they  are  paid.  (Tr.  at  20-22,  30-31,  39,  52-55,  67-68;  Applicant’s
