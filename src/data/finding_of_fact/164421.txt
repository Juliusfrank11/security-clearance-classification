Applicant  is  a  56-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  where  he  has
worked since November 2019. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1987
until he retired with an honorable discharge in 2011. He is rated 100% disabled by the
Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  from  a  service-related  injury.  He  has  a  bachelor’s
degree, which he earned in 2017. He married for the third time in 2019. He has seven
children between the ages of 6 and 19. (Items 4, 5)
The amended SOR alleges Applicant owes back child support in the amounts of
$66,772  and  $24,274  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.i);  he  did  not  file  his  2017  and  2018  federal
and  state  income  tax  returns  (SOR  ¶¶  1.j  and  1.k);  and  he  owes  six delinquent  debts
totaling  about  $29,000  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b-1.g).  The  debts  include  $13,937  owed  after
Applicant  returned  a  leased  2017  luxury  car  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  and  $4,269  owed  on  the
purchase  of  his  wife’s  engagement  ring  and  their  wedding  rings  (SOR  ¶  1.d).  The
allegations are established through credit reports and Applicant’s admissions. (Items 3,
5-8)
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  his  2017  divorce  from  his  second
wife and high child support payments. He was unemployed for a period from about 2017
to  2018.  His  wife  is  an  immigrant  who  was  waiting  for  authorization  to  work  in  this
country. (Items 4, 5)
Applicant admitted  owing all  of  the SOR debts  with  the exception of  the $4,031
debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e and the $63 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g.  He stated that both
debts  were  paid.  He  did  not  provide  any  documentation  establishing  they  were  paid.
The $4,031 debt is reported on the 2019 combined credit report and the 2020 Equifax
credit  report.  The  activity  date  is  September  2018.  The  debt  is  not  listed  on  the  2021
Equifax report. The $63 debt is listed on all of the credit reports. (Items 3, 5-8)
Applicant filed his 2018 federal and state income tax returns late. He still had not
filed the 2017 income tax returns as of the date of his SOR response. He stated that he
did not file the returns because he knew that he would owe taxes, and he did not have
the money to pay them. He indicated in his response to the SOR that he planned to file
the  2017  returns  in  the  upcoming  tax  season.  No  additional  information  was  provided
about the 2017 returns. (Items 3-5)
Applicant  admitted  to owing the  $66,772  and  $24,274  child  support  arrearages.
He stated that the $24,274 delinquency was being paid by garnishment from his military
retirement  pay.  He  provided  a  copy  of  his  retiree  account  statement.  The  statement
shows  three  garnishments  ordered  in  the  amounts  of  $1,501,  $859,  and  $782,  but  it
only showed $452 being deducted from his pay, likely because his pay was not enough
to pay even one of the three garnishments. The $66,772 child support arrearages have
increased  on  each  credit  report  in  evidence,  with  the  2021  credit  report  showing  a
balance of $71,793. (Items 3, 5-8)
Applicant  stated that  he  intends  to  pay his debts.  He admitted  that his finances
were  in  bad  shape,  but  he  expected  them  to  improve  when  his  wife  receives
authorization  to  work.  (Items  3,  5)  He  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM,  so  more  recent
information about his finances is not available.
