Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  2007.  He  is  applying  for  a  security  clearance  for  the  first
time. He has an associate’s degree and additional college credits and certifications. He
is married, with a child and two stepchildren. He and his wife also helped raise a child
that they think of as one of their children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 49-50, 71-72; GE 1; AE A,

From  2014  to  2018,  Applicant  lived  in  a  state  where  marijuana  use  was  legal
under  state  law.  His  wife  had  success  with  medical  marijuana  in  treating  her  illness.
Applicant researched marijuana for medicinal purposes. He knew that while legal under
state  law,  it  was  a  controlled  substance  and  illegal  under  federal  law.  On  his  doctor’s
recommendation,  he  used  marijuana  in  the  form  of  edibles,  rubs,  and  vapes  for  his
insomnia  and  pain  management.  (Tr.  at  53-56,  64-65,  73,  80-81,  85-87;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
In  2018,  Applicant  moved  to  a  state  that  permitted  marijuana  use  for  medicinal
purposes. He used the marijuana rubs, but he did not take any edibles after he moved
in  2018,  and  he  did  not  use  marijuana  in  vape  form  until  he  received  a  card  from  the
state’s  cannabis  commission.  The  state  made  recreational  marijuana  use  legal  under
state law. It was no longer necessary for Applicant to have a medical marijuana card as
anyone  could  purchase  and  use  it  under  state  law.  (Tr.  at  56,  66,  82-84,  88-89;

Applicant reported his marijuana use on the Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86) he submitted in April 2020. He noted that he intended to continue to
“use  edibles,  rubs  or  vapes  as  necessary  to  assist  with
insomnia  and  pain
management.” (GE 1)
Applicant  fully  discussed  his  marijuana  use  when  he  was  interviewed  for  his
background investigation in May 2020.  He indicated that he was aware that marijuana
use  was  illegal  under  federal  law,  but  he  followed  the  state’s  approach.  When  he
responded  to  DOHA  interrogatories  in  October  2020,  he  indicated  that  he  planned  to
continue  using  marijuana
insomnia  and  pain
management. (GE 2)

Applicant  did  not  understand  the  full  ramifications  of  his  marijuana  use  until  he
received  the  SOR  and  discussed  it  with  his  attorney.  He  was  previously  incorrectly
advised  that  as  long  as  he  was  completely  honest,  that  his  marijuana  use  would  not
preclude him from holding a security clearance.  The last time he purchased marijuana
was in December 2020, and the last time he used marijuana was in January 2021. He
now completely realizes that marijuana use is against the law, not responsible conduct,
and inconsistent with holding a security clearance. (Tr. at 22-25, 67, 75-77, 80, 92-98;

Applicant was not a recreational drug user. He credibly testified that he does not
intend to use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future. He honestly admitted that
if  marijuana  is  legalized  federally,  he  would  consider  using  it  again  for  its  medicinal
properties.  His  wife  also  used  marijuana  for medicinal  purposes.  She  does  not  hold  a
security clearance, but she stopped using marijuana to support her husband. They have
both  pursued  treatments  for  their  ailments  that  do  not  involve  marijuana.  Applicant
passed  a  drug  test  in  August  2021.  He  was  evaluated  by  a  licensed  clinical  social
worker  (LCSW)  who  concluded  that  he  did  not  meet  the  criteria  for  cannabis  use
disorder.  He  provided  a  signed  statement  of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  illegal  drug  use
with  the  acknowledgment  that  any  future  involvement  with  illegal  drugs  would  be
grounds  for  revocation  of  his  security  clearance.  I  found  him  to  be  forthcoming  and
credible. (Tr. at 57-58, 64-65, 70, 75, 78-79, 89-91, 100-105; AE D, I, J)
Applicant called witnesses and submitted documents and letters attesting to his
excellent job performance and character. He is praised for his professionalism, technical
expertise, reliability, trustworthiness, leadership, work ethic, dependability, and honesty.
