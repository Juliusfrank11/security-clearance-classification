The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  incurred  eleven  delinquent  debts  owed  to
creditors  on  accounts  that  were  charged  off  or  placed  for  collection  totaling
approximately $34,628.  In his answer, Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth
in  the  SOR.  Credit  reports  of  the  Applicant  dated  September  27,  2019;  January  21,
2020; and March 12, 2021, confirm that he is indebted to each of the creditors listed in
the SOR.  (Government Exhibits 3, 4, and 5.)
Applicant served in the U.S. Army from 2008 to 2019.  He married in 2008 and
separated in 2011.  During his military career, Applicant was not financially responsible.
He  testified  that  beginning  with  his  first  duty  station,  and  continuing  throughout  his

working for his current employer in October 2019.
Two months later, in December 2019, after receiving the SOR, Applicant began
to “hustle” to get his debts resolved.  In January or February 2021, he hired a debt relief
company  to  assist  him  in  resolving  his  delinquent  debts.  Beginning  in  May  2021,  he
pays  $336  every  two  weeks  for  their  financial  services.
(Applicant’s  Exhibit  A.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  has  placed  three  of  the  debts  listed  in  the  SOR  in  the
program.  The way the program works is that one debt gets paid off at a time.  Once the
three debts  are paid off,  they will  move  on  to  the others  to get  them  resolved.  (Tr. p.
26.)  Applicant’s intent is to  have  each  of the debts listed  in the SOR resolved  through
this program.
The following delinquent debts are of security concern:
1.a. Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a vehicle he purchased in 2015, which
was repossessed in 2017, in the amount of $20,825.  The balance on the account grew
to $22,822.  The account was charged  off.  The debt relief company has negotiated a
settlement  of  this  account  in  the  amount  of  $3,338.  Applicant  has  not  yet  paid  the
settlement amount.  (Tr. pp. 27-28.)
1.b.  Applicant  is  indebted  to  a  creditor  in  the  amount  of  $6,478  for  an  account
