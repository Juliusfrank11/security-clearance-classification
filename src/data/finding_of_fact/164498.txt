In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  both  of  the  SOR  allegations  with
explanations. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.  After a review of the
pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He began  working
at  his  present  job  in  October  2018.  He  experienced  unemployment  for  approximately
two months in 2014. He served in the Marine Corps for approximately 13 years, before
he was honorably discharged. He served a combat deployment to Iraq.  He has a high
school diploma and has taken some college and technical courses. He married in 2008
and divorced in 2017. He pays child support for his two children. (Tr. at 5, 19, 21-24; GE
1)
The SOR alleged that Applicant owed delinquent federal taxes in the amount of
approximately $10,741 for tax year 2016; that he failed to file his 2017 federal income
tax return as required; and that he  owed federal taxes in the amount of  approximately
$10,067 for tax year 2017. He admitted the allegations in his SOR answer. He supplied
documentation when answering interrogatories that supported the late filing of his 2017
federal return and his delinquent tax debts for 2016 and 2017. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.b). (GE
2; SOR answer)
Applicant attributed his tax problems to a number of things. In 2016 he became
employed as an independent contractor rather than a direct employee. This change of
status required him to account for and pay his federal taxes directly rather than having
his  employer  do  the  accounting  for  him  through  pay  withholding.  He  did  not  receive  a
W-2 tax form from his contractor-employer, but rather a form 1099, which required him
to  account  for  his  own  federal  tax  liability.  For  tax  years  2016  and  2017,  he  failed  to
properly account for his federal taxes, which earned him the large tax delinquencies for
both years. His reason for not paying his required taxes for those years was because he
was supporting his wife and children and could not afford to pay his taxes with what was
left over. He testified that he had no excuse for filing his 2017 federal return as late as
he did, which was in May 2019. He also claimed that he contacted the IRS in 2017 and
2019 to set up payment plans, but for some reason neither attempt was successful. He
admitted he did not really follow up on that issue. Since then, he claims he timely filed
his 2018 and 2020 federal returns, but he testified that he was not sure about his 2019
return.  In  his  post-hearing  documents,  he  provided  a  2019  tax  return  prepared  by  the
tax relief company (TRC) he hired to prepare his tax returns. It appears the return was
to  be  electronically  filed,  but  there  is  no  date  on  the  return  or  any  other  evidence
indicating when it was filed. He is not sure if he owes federal taxes for year 2019, but he
does  owe  some  amount  for  year  2020.  He  believes  his  current  federal  tax  debt  is
approximately $36,000. He did not provide documentation to support these assertions. I
will  not  consider  any  of  the  evidence  concerning  Applicant’s  late  federal  filing  of  his
2019  tax  return  or  his  additional  amount  of  delinquent  federal  taxes  owed  for
disqualification  purposes,  but  I  may  consider  it  to  help  assess  his  credibility,  for  the
application of possible mitigating conditions, and for the whole-person analysis. (Tr. 19,
24-29, 31; GE 2; AE B)
Sometime   earlier  this  year,  Applicant  contacted   the   TRC   to   assess  his  tax
situation.  After   that  assessment,   Applicant   hired   the   TRC   in   June   2021   to   review   his
past ten  years of  federal and  state  tax  returns to  determine  whether there were errors,
which  could   be   corrected.   The   TRC   will  also  contact  the   IRS   to   try   to   work  out   a
payment  schedule  for  him.  As  of   the   hearing   date,  no   repayment  plan   had   been
established.   Other  than   the   TRC,  Applicant  has  not  received   any   financial  counseling.
(Tr. 20, 30-32;  AE A)
Other  than   his  tax   issues,  Applicant’s  finances  are   in  good   shape.   Applicant
believes he  does a good job at this job. (Tr. 32, 42; GE 5)
