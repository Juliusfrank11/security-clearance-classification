In  his  Answers  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  seven  of  the  SOR  allegations
pertaining to financial considerations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.e., 1.h., and 1.i.). He denied
the two remaining allegations. His comments with respect to both his admissions and his
denials are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in
the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a tool and fabrication inspector with his current employer since 2019. He previously
served as a quality control inspector for other employers from 2011 until 2018. A 2009
high school graduate, he received a technical school certification as a medical assistant
in 2011; some college credits, but no degree; and he is currently enrolled in an unspecified
science,  technology,  engineering,  and  mathematics  (STEM)  program.  He  has  never
served with the U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance. He has never been
married.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can be found in the following exhibits: GE 1 (SF 86); GE 2 (Enhanced Subject Interview,
dated May 2, 2019); GE 4 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report,
dated  April  9,  2019);  GE  3  (Equifax  Credit  Report,  dated  December  17,  2019);  and
Applicant’s Answer to the SOR (Answer).
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  several  factors  which  depleted  his
financial resources and led to several financial accounts becoming delinquent: in around
2014, his father experienced heart problems and underwent surgeries for which Applicant
paid the  expenses; they  resided  together until  2019, and  he  paid the  rent and  for food; he
was  unemployed   for   two   months   in  2017   (during   which  he   received   unemployment
benefits);  he   was  involved   in  an   automobile  accident  which  totaled   his vehicle,  but   his
insurance   company   refused   to   cover the   damages;  he   needed   transportation   to   get  to
work  and  school  so  he  purchased  another vehicle; and  his identity  was stolen. He failed
to   submit  any   documentation   to   support   or   verify   his  contentions   with   respect   to   his
father’s health issues and payments; the insurance issues; or identity theft.
In March 2019, when Applicant completed his SF 86, he acknowledged that there
was a delinquent automobile loan since 2012. On May 2, 2019, during an interview with
an  investigator  from  the  U.S.  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM),  Applicant
acknowledged  several  identified  delinquent  accounts,  but  claimed  to  be  unaware  of
several other described delinquent debts. He contended that he had matured and was
now  living  within  his  means;  budgeting;  prioritizing  accounts;  checking  prices  before
making  purchases;  and  seeking  financial  advice  from  friends  who  are  good  with  their
finances.  He  described  his  finances  as  “getting  better  and  improving.”  He  stated  an
intention  to  look  into  those  accounts  about  which  he  was  unaware,  and  setting  up
payment arrangements. He denied that his failure to pay his accounts was intentional,
and explained that he simply could not keep up with them.  (GE 2)
The SOR alleged nine delinquent accounts that were placed for collection, charged
off, or for which there was a repossession, totaling approximately $35,847, as set forth as
follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a. refers to an automobile loan with a high credit of $22,185 made in 2012
that  became  delinquent  in  2013  after  the  vehicle  was  totaled  but  not  covered  by
insurance. In February 2013, $19,675 was charged off, but the creditor still reports a past-
due-balance of $25,374. (GE 4, at 5; GE 3, at 1; GE 2, at 4-5; Answer, at 1) Applicant
acknowledged  that  he  had  not  even  attempted  to  contact  the  creditor  to  resolve  the
charged-off account for the past five years. (Tr. at 47) The account has not been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b.  refers to  an  automobile  loan  with  a  high  credit of  $19,599  made  in 2014
that  Applicant  voluntarily  returned   via  repossession   when   his  monthly   payments
“skyrocketed”  and   he   was  faced   with   increased   medical   expenses  for  his   father.   In
November 2014, $4,521  was charged off.  (GE  4,  at  5;  GE  3,  at  2;  GE  2,  at  6;  Answer, at
1) Applicant acknowledged  that he  last  contacted  the  creditor about the  account in 2017,
but claims  he  was told  that the  account  had  been  charged  off.  (Tr.  at 50-51) During  the
hearing, he  stated  that  he  had  no  intention  to  pay  off  the  account,  “at the  moment.” (Tr.
at 50) The  account has not been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c. refers to an automobile loan with a high credit of $10,564 made in 2015
that was involuntarily repossessed in 2018. Applicant claimed that he was late with one
monthly  payment  and  that  there  were  “hidden”  late-payment  fees.  He  spoke  with  the
creditor, but one morning the vehicle was gone.  In January 2019, $3,061 was charged
off. He has not made any effort within the past four years to resolve the account, and he
intends  to  dispute  it. (GE  4,  at  6;  GE  3,  at 2;  GE  2,  at  6;  Answer, at 2; Tr.  at  54) The
account has not been resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.d. refers  to  an automobile insurance account with an  unpaid balance  of
$756   that  was  placed   for  collection   in   2019.  The   account   was  for  one   of   Applicant’s
vehicles  that he  no  longer had, but failed  to  notify  the  company  that he  no  longer had  it to
cancel insurance  coverage. (GE 4, at 13; GE  3, at 2; Tr. at 54-55) He  acknowledged  that
he  had  made  no  efforts to  resolve  the  account until  two  months before the  hearing, and
his  current  intent   is  to   pay   it  off.  He  previously   disputed   the   account  for  unspecified
reasons.   (GE  3,   at   2)   He  now   contends   he   and   the   creditor  agreed   to   have   monthly
payments  to  commence  shortly  after the  COVID-19  pandemic. (Answer, at 2; Tr. at  56)
Applicant  offered   no   documentary   evidence   to   support  the   existence   of   a   repayment
agreement.  The  account has not been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.e. refers to medical account – actually referred to by Applicant as a dental
account – with an unpaid balance of $412 that was placed for collection in 2019. (GE 4,
at 12; GE 3, at 2; Answer, at 2) Although he initially had no recollection of the account,
he did subsequently acknowledge that the delinquency occurred after he was laid off in
2017, and his coverage had lapsed without his knowledge. He acknowledged that he had
initially made no efforts to contact the creditor, and then claimed he was unsuccessful in
attempting  to  do  so  in  2019.  (GE  2,  at  5;  Tr.  at  57)  Applicant  intended  to  contact  the
creditor  after  Memorial  Day  in  2020  to  establish  a  repayment  plan.  (Answer,  at  2)  He
never contacted the creditor. (Tr. at 77) Applicant offered no documentation or testimony
to verify that such a plan had been established or payments made. The account has not
been resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.f. and 1.g. refer to two medical accounts with unpaid balances of $169
and $132 that were placed for collection in 2019. (GE 4, at 13; GE 3, at 3; GE 2, at 5;
Answer at 2-3) Applicant claims he disputed both accounts in 2020 because he believes
they  resulted  from  the  theft  of  his  identity.  (Tr.  at  58-60)  He  offered  no  documentary
evidence  to  support that  identity  theft  occurred  or  was  reported,  or that  disputes  were
actually made. The accounts have not been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.h. refers to a cellular telephone account with an unpaid balance of $1,048
that  was  placed  for  collection  in  2019.  He  initially  denied  knowing  anything  about  the
creditor or the account, then acknowledged that the creditor “overwhelmed” his account
with data charges that were for personal use that he was unaware of, and also claimed
he had forgotten about the bills. (GE 4, at 12; GE 2, at 5; Answer, at 3; Tr. at 60-62)  It is
now his intent to pay the bill off, but he has not made any efforts to do so since he received
the first bill because it is lower on his list of priorities. (Tr. at 63; Answer, at 3) The account
has not been resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.i.  refers  to  an  unspecified  type  of  account  –  later  acknowledged  by
Applicant to be either a charge card or credit card – with a bank with an unpaid balance
of $374 that was placed for collection in 2014 and eventually sold to a debt purchaser.
(GE 4, at 13; GE 2, at 5; Answer, at 3) Applicant denied ever receiving a bill from either
the creditor or the debt purchaser.  He later claimed that the card had been lost or stolen.
(Answer, at 3) He has made no efforts to contact either party, but claims that if the account
is valid, he will pay it. (Tr. at 65, 78) The account has not been resolved.
Although he had not resolved any of the SOR-related delinquent accounts, in an
effort  to  reflect  his  efforts  to  improve  his  financial  reputation,  Applicant  submitted
documentation  to  verify  either  modest  payments  to  other  creditors  or  disputes:  an
unspecified credit card with a now zero balance (but with a $40 late charge incurred in
August 2021) (AE A); monthly payments to a college for a student loan (AE B); monthly
loan payments (AE C); a dispute of an unspecified type of account (AE D); and an account
history similar to a check  register indicating all  monthly expense  payments  –  including
rent and utilities – made between August 1, 2020 and August 1, 2021 (AE E).
During  the  hearing,  Applicant  estimated  that  his  monthly net  income  was  about
$2,800 to $2,920; his estimated monthly expenses were substantial reflecting a variety of
different expenses; and his remainder was unspecified and dwindling. (Tr. at 68-73) His
checking  account  had  less  than  $1,000,  he  had  no  savings  account,  and  his  401k
retirement  account  had  $19,500.  (Tr.  at  66-67)  During  the  hearing  I  requested  that
Applicant  complete  and  submit  to  me  and  Department  Counsel  a  Personal  Financial
Statement to reflect the specifics of his current net monthly income, monthly expenses,
and a monthly remainder available for discretionary spending or savings. (Tr. at 74, 80)
He failed to do so.
Applicant has never had financial counseling, and he has no idea about how to
obtain it. (Tr. at 76, 79)
