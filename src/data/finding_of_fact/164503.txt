The  SOR  alleges  that  the  Applicant  is  indebted  to  the  Federal  government  for
delinquent  taxes  for tax  years  2014,  2015  and  2016.  He  is also  indebted  to  six other
creditors  for  accounts  that  have  either  been  placed  for  collection  or  charged  off.
Applicant  admits  each  of  the  allegations  set  forth  in  the  SOR.  Credit  reports  of  the
Applicant dated January 4, 2019, and December 22, 2020, confirm the indebtedness.
Applicant  began  working  for  his  current  employer  in  March  2020.  He  has  had
consistent  employment  as  an  engineer  since  April  2012,  with  no  period  of
unemployment.  Applicant served in the U.S. Navy from 1995 to 1999, and received an
honorable discharge. (Government Exhibit 3.)
In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  explained  that  his financial  problems  were
caused by his wife’s mismanagement of funds, her failing to timely file  their income tax
returns  for  tax  years  2014  through  2016,  and  his  prior  period  of  unemployment  from
2011 to 2012.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  The following delinquent debts set forth in the
SOR are of security concern:
1.a.  A  delinquent debt is owed  to  the  Federal Government for delinquent taxes in the
amount   of  $7,834.12   for  tax   years  2014,  2015   and   2016.     Applicant  states  that  he   is
currently in payment plan with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the amount of $500
a   month.    There  is  no   evidence   in  the   record   that  shows  that  he   has  started   making
payments toward the debt yet.   (Government Exhibit 4.)
1.b.   A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for a medical account that was placed for
collections in the approximate amount of $2,863.  The debt remains owing.
1.c.   A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for a repossessed vehicle that was charged
off in the approximate amount of $15,097.  The debt remains owing.
1.d.  A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection
in the approximate amount of $2,870.  The debt remains owing.
1.e.  A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection
in the approximate amount of $838.  The debt remains owing.

in the approximate amount of $315.  The debt remains owing.
1.g.  A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection

Applicant did not file his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and
2016  until  after  receiving  the  CAF  interrogatories  in  February  2020.
(Government
Exhibit  4.)  Applicant’s  credit  report  dated  December  22,  2020,  indicates  that  he
purchased a vehicle for $47,328 in or around November 2020.  (Government Exhibit 6.)
This  was  not  a  prudent  decision  given  the  fact  that  he  has  so  many  outstanding
delinquent debts.
