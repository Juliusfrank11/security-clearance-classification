Applicant’s personal information is extracted from his 2020 SCA unless otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  52  years  old  and  has  worked  for  U.S.  defense  contractors  as  an
engineer since 2008. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1987 and served until 1997, when
he  was  honorably  discharged.  During  his  service,  he  earned  several  awards  and
commendations.  He  married  in  1991  and  divorced  in  2017.  He  has  no  children.  He
graduated  from  high  school  in  1987  and  has  earned  several  certifications  for  computer
technology. (Tr. at 14; 23; AE D AE J; AE K.)
SOR  Allegation
Paragraph 1, Guideline H - The SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana “with
varying frequencies” during the period September 2016 to at least May 2020, including
after  being  granted  access  to  classified  information  in  July  2018.  In  his  Answer,  he
admitted the allegation and provided some mitigating facts and circumstances, which he
repeated at the hearing.
Applicant was granted his first security clearance in 1991 when he was in the Navy.
He  has  held  a  clearance  continuously  since  February  2008  while  working  for  U.S.
Government contractors. His eligibility was last renewed in 2017, based upon a security
clearance application he submitted in April 2017 (2017 SCA). In his 2017 SCA, he
disclosed  that  he  smoked  marijuana  between  September  2016  and  January  2017.  In
response  to  a  question  about  his  frequency  of  use,  he  wrote  “smoked  Marijuana  @  a
party with friends.” He responded in the negative to a question about his future intentions
to  use  this  drug  in  the  future,  and  he  wrote:  “It  does  nothing  for  me.  I  actually  get  a
headache  the  next  morning  from  use  .  .  .  ha  ha  I  like  Beer  better  .  .  .”  (Ellipsis  and
capitalization in the original.) (Tr. at 31; GE 4 at 32-33; AE G.)
In his 2020 SCA, he disclosed more recent uses of marijuana on the application in
addition  to  the  2016-2017  uses.  He  disclosed  that  he  used marijuana  two  times  over  a
one-week period in May 2020. He provided the following additional comments:
During COVID-19 isolation, I Smoked some Marijuana to experiment during
a  depression  time  2  months  into  quarantine.  It  really  did  not  help  so  I
stopped.  (Capitalization in the original.)
In  response  to  the  question  about  his  future  intentions  with  respect  to  using  this  drug,
Applicant again checked the box indicating he had no future intent to use marijuana, and
he  wrote:  “I  did  not  get  the  relief,  am  no  longer  depressed  and  for  my  current  job
clearance.” (GE 1 at 34-35.)
Applicant  has  been  interviewed  two  times  regarding  his  marijuana  use  in
connection with his two most recent security clearance applications, first in January 2018
and  then  in  July  2020.  As  of  January  2018,  Applicant  admitted  using  marijuana
approximately three times between September 2016 and January 2017. He explained to
the investigator that he first used marijuana in 2016 by himself in his father’s back yard
while  he  was  caring  for  his  father  who  was  ill.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  had  no
intention to use marijuana again because he did not enjoy the drug and he had too much
to lose working as a contractor for the U.S. Government. (GE 2 at 1. 4-5; GE 3 at 1, 4-5.)
In his July 2020 interview, he told the investigator that he used marijuana again in
May 2020 during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic when state law required him
to shelter in place. He diagnosed himself as feeling depressed. He bought the marijuana
and  a  CBD  chocolate  edible  from  a  marijuana  dispensary  that  legally  sold  marijuana
products under the law of his state. He ate the edible at home alone. He also discussed
with the investigator his prior use of marijuana starting in September 2016, when he was
taking  care  of  his  terminally ill  father.  He  also  mentioned  his  use  at  a  New  Year’s  Eve
party. (GE 3 at 1, 4-5.)
Applicant testified that his past use of marijuana was during periods of stress when
he was feeling depressed by his life’s circumstances, which included the loss of his long-
term marriage and the deaths of his mother in early 2016 and then his father in later 2016.
He  also lost  his brother,  who  was  homeless and  died  in  an  accident,  leaving  Applicant
with only one family member, his sister. (Tr. at 18-21, 27.)
In  anticipation  of  a  future  hearing  regarding  his  clearance  eligibility,  Applicant
sought drug counseling at the request of his attorney. He testified that he learned from
this one-time counseling experience in March 2021 that there was a relationship between
his  drug  use  and  his  psychological  state.  This  is  a  connection  he  already  understood,
however. He wrote in his June 2020 SCA that his use of marijuana two times in March
2020 was due to feeling depressed. He no longer believes that he is suffering from any
psychological issues. (Tr. at 18-21; GE 1 at 34-35; AE C.)
Applicant’s testimony about the number of times he has used marijuana or another
THC  product  was  inconsistent.  He  testified  on  direct  examination  that  he  only  used
marijuana on three occasions. The first time was in March 2016, and the most recent time
was March 2020. On cross-examination, it became apparent that he had used marijuana
on  more  than  three  occasions.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  used  marijuana  on  two
occasions in September 2016. Also, Department Counsel pointed out that in Applicant’s
2018  background  interview,  he  admitted  using  marijuana  on  three  occasions  between
September 2016 and January 2017, the third time being at a New Year’s Eve party with
friends. He then testified that he used marijuana once again in March 2020. He had written
in his 2020 SCA that he last used marijuana twice in May 2020. At the hearing, he clarified
that the number of uses in 2020 was indeed twice. In 2020, he made a marijuana joint
using rolling paper he obtained from a neighbor. He lives in a condominium where it is
common  for  his  neighbors  to  smoke  marijuana.  He  partially  smoked  the  marijuana  by
himself on a couple of occasions. He also testified that he consumed the chocolate CBD
edible. (Tr. at 27-28, 41-52, 59-62, 64-66; GE 2 at 4-5; GE 3 at 4-5.)
Applicant had some confusion about the date of the New Year’s Eve party incident.
He attempted to change the date of his sole use of marijuana with friends from New Year’s
Eve  December  31,  2016,  to  December  31,  2017.  That  testimony,  however,  was
inconsistent with his disclosure in his April 2017 SCA, in which he dated the New Year’s
Eve party as occurring about three months earlier, i.e., on December 31, 2016-January
1, 2017. It could not have occurred one year later because that would have been after he
disclosed  marijuana  use  over  New  Year’s  Eve  2016-2017  on  his  April  2017  SCA,  a
document he prepared only months later. In his attorney’s Post-Hearing Arguments, the
attorney clarified that upon reflection after the hearing, Applicant realized that he had used
marijuana  at  New  Year’s  Eve  parties  in  both  years.  (Tr.  at 27-28,  41- 45;  GE  3  at  4-5;
Hearing Exhibit II.)
Applicant testified that he has no future intent to use marijuana. He also provided
a written statement confirming that intention and consenting to the automatic revocation
of his clearance in the event of a violation of his statement. Applicant also testified that
he no longer associates with the individuals he had used marijuana with in the past. As
noted, he has twice represented in his clearance applications that he has no intention of
using marijuana again. Also, he advised the investigator in 2018 of this same intention,
only to smoke marijuana twice in May 2020 and to eat a CBD edible the same week. (Tr.
at 29, 52-55; GE 1 at 34-45; GE 3 at 32; GE 4 at 32; AE A.)
Whole-Person Evidence
Applicant  presented  a  significant  amount  of  character  evidence,  starting  with  his
military  career,  as  discussed  above.  He  also  provided  evidence  of  his  volunteer  work,
which  was  impressive.  Two  co-workers  provided  reference  letters.  Both  were  aware  of
the SOR allegation. They praise Applicant’s knowledge, dedication, skills, and work ethic.
They believe him to be reliable and trustworthy. (Tr. at 24-65; AE E; AE  F.)
