Having  thoroughly  considered  the  evidence  in  the  record,  I  make  the  following
findings  of  fact:  Applicant  is  30  years  old.  He  enlisted  in  the  Army  National  Guard
(ARNG)  in  July  2012,  where  he  served  as  a  signal  support  systems  specialist.  He
received an honorable discharge due to a medical condition (seizure disorder) in August
2014. Since October 2017, he has worked for a DOD contractor and recently accepted
a  promotion  as  a  numerical  control  programmer  making  approximately  $59,000  per
year. He is currently married and has an 11-month old son. His wife is a stay-at-home
mother. He does not currently possess a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 21-24, 27-30, 83;
GE 1)
The  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  determined  Applicant’s  military  disability  was
approximately 10 percent following his ARNG discharge. In early 2020 the VA decided
Applicant had a 100 percent total and permanent disability. In July 2020 he received a
lump-sum back-payment of $17,000 from the VA due to the increased percentage of his
disability.  Since  November  2020  Applicant  has  received  $3,450  per  month  for  his
military service disability. (Tr. 21-24, 27-30; AE F)
Psychological Conditions  and Financial Considerations
SOR  allegation  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  Applicant  was  diagnosed  in  2019  with  major
depressive disorder and gambling disorder. The therapist noted that Applicant struggled
to control his gambling; he lied to his fiancé (now wife) about his gambling; and although
his  gambling  adversely  impacted  his  finances,  he  was  not  ready  to  completely  stop
gambling. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR response. (GE 8)
SOR  allegation  ¶  1.b  alleges  that  Applicant  visited  a  therapist  in  August  2020,
and  he  admitted  that  he  continued  to  gamble.  The  therapist  opined  that  there  was  a
potential  for  Applicant’s  condition  to  adversely  impact  his  judgment  and  reliability
because  he  suffered  from  a  lack  of  impulse  control  and  did  not  continue  any
recommended treatment for this condition. Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. (AE
E)
In  March  2013,  Applicant  filed  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy,  which  was  later
converted  to  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  December  2019.  The  bankruptcy  was
discharged  in  April  2020.  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation  and  testified
that  he  was  not  good  at  managing  money.  He  also  admitted  that  beginning  in  about
2017, he started gambling. His gambling increased to the point where he was going to
the  casino  one  or  two  times  weekly,  spending  approximately  $400  on  each  occasion.
Applicant’s  gambling  losses  eventually  prevented  him  from  continuing  the  Chapter  13
payments  to  the  trustee,  and  a  change  was  initiated  by  his  attorney  to  deduct  the
payments  directly  from  Applicant’s  paychecks.  Applicant  started  relying  on  credit  card
cash advances and using speedy loans to pay for his gambling and living expenses. His
financial  situation  steadily  worsened  and  he  made  the  decision  to  convert  his  current
Chapter 13 bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 2019. (Tr. 30-36, 87-88;
GE 5, GE 6, GE 7; AE A, AE B, AE C, AE D)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant’s  student  loans  totaling  about  $6,732  were
delinquent.  (SOR  ¶¶ 2.b,  2.c,  and  2.d) Applicant  provided  post-hearing documentation
dated  March  2021  showing  that  the  combined  total  of  his  student  loans  was  $15,210.
The VA also notified the U.S. Department of Education that Applicant was eligible for a
total and permanent disability discharge of his federal student loans, which canceled his
obligation to repay the remaining student loan balances. (Tr. 36-38, 40; GE 3, GE 4; AE
F)
The SOR alleged that Applicant owed two  First Premier credit cards in the total
amount of $1,910 that had been charged off. (SOR ¶¶ 2.e, and 2.f.) These allegations
were  withdrawn  by  Department  Counsel  as  the  debts  were  included  in  the  Chapter  7
bankruptcy discharge. This information was also verified  by the December 2020 credit
report in evidence that listed both accounts with a zero balance. (Tr. 38-41; GE 3, GE 4;
AE B, AE C)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  owed  a  Credit  One  Bank  credit  card  in  the
approximate  amount  of  $858.  (SOR  ¶  2.g)  This  debt  was  also  included  in  the
bankruptcy discharge. (Tr. 41-43; GE 4; AE B, AE C)
SOR  ¶  2.h  alleged  that  Applicant  continued  to  gamble  despite  his  delinquent
accounts and pending bankruptcy, which he admitted in his SOR response. He testified
that  while  the  bankruptcy  was  pending,  he  was  experiencing  some  depression,  and
gambling made him feel better about himself. Applicant’s stated his last visit to a casino
occurred in July 2020. (Tr. 33-36, 48)
In 2019, Applicant’s fiancée confronted him about his gambling problem. He lied
to  her  and  denied  he  was  gambling,  but  she  threatened  to  call  off  their  upcoming
wedding unless he sought  professional counseling. Applicant agreed and enrolled in a
treatment  program  from  June  6,  2019  through  July  30,  2019.  He  was  diagnosed  with
major depressive disorder and gambling disorder. He admitted to the counselor that he
had  just  recently  lost  $1,000  at  the  casino.  His  family  doctor  prescribed  an
antidepressant medication (name unrecalled), but he quickly discontinued taking it after
a couple of months as he did not like how the medication made him feel. Despite being
in  treatment, in  part for his gambling addiction,  Applicant  continued  gambling because
he  enjoyed  it  and  believed  he  could  responsibly  control  his  gambling.  He  visited  the
casino one to two times weekly, and he told his counselor he only wished to reduce, not
eliminate, his gambling visits. Applicant testified at the hearing he had permission from
his therapist to continue visiting the casino to see if he really could control his gambling.
He went to the casino with only $100 to see if he could control it, and he continued this
pattern until he acknowledged  to the counselor that he could not control  his gambling.
His counselor advised him that he needed to completely stop gambling and to continue
counseling to help him overcome his gambling addiction. After July 30, 2019, Applicant
did not see a counselor for his gambling disorder for over a year because his counselor
was on an indefinite leave of absence, and he did not want to see any other therapist for
his treatment. (Tr. 34, 64-65, 67-71, 84-86, 89-90; AE E)
During  Applicant’s  June  22,  2020  background  interview,  he  volunteered  to  the
investigator that he had a gambling addiction. Applicant reported that from August 2018
through  July 2019 he  lost  on average  $300 to  $1,000  weekly  due to  gambling.  During
his Chapter 13  bankruptcy  when  the monthly payments  were  being deducted from his
paychecks, Applicant opened about six to eight credit card accounts and payday loans
to help pay for his gambling. The credit card cash advances and payday loans  totaled
about $14,000, and he eventually included these debts in his December 2019 Chapter 7
bankruptcy  conversion.  Applicant  also  spent  approximately  $9,000  of  his  personal
savings  to  support  his  gambling  addiction.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  received
treatment  for  his  gambling  addiction  from  July  2019  through  December  2019.
Applicant’s actual  dates of treatment  occurred  from  June  6,  2019  to  July  30, 2019. He
also reported that he stopped gambling in July 2019, and he did not anticipate that he
would gamble in the future. (Tr. 30-31, 34-36, 60-62, 87; GE 2, GE 8)
In July 2020, Applicant received a lump-sum disability back-payment of $17,000
from  the  VA.  Applicant  testified  that  he  had  resumed  gambling  in  May  or  June  2020,
and  it  was  not  until  July  2020  that  he  realized  that  he  did  have  an  uncontrollable
gambling problem, and he could never visit a casino again. He went to the casino to fill
out an exclusionary ticket in July 2020, but he also took about $300 with him to gamble
one last time before filling out the paperwork. He won $200, completed the exclusionary
ticket, and the casino personnel escorted him to the parking lot. In August 2020, he took
out a loan from his 401k in the amount of approximately $2,124. He could not recall the
reason why he took out that loan, but thought possibly to purchase items for the birth of
his son. He is current on the bi-weekly loan payments of $56.26 since it is taken directly
out  of  his  paychecks.  Applicant  reiterated  that  the  last  time  he  gambled  was  in  July
2020. (Tr. 67-69, 73-75, 87-88; SOR response; AE G)
On August 22, 2020, Applicant visited another counselor because he stated that
he needed help to control his gambling addiction. He reported to the counselor that he
had started gambling again a few months ago. The 2019 treatment he received was not
successful.  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  major  depression  disorder,  active,  and
gambling  disorder,  active.  The  treatment  objective  was  to  explore  and  resolve  issues
related  to  his  addictive  behavior,  including  gambling,  and  for  Applicant  to  stay
completely  free  of  gambling.  He  was  also  to  be  referred  to  a  psychiatrist  due  to  his
underlying depression that could be contributing to his addictive behavior. Applicant was
supposed to contact the therapist to set up his next appointment, but he did not like this
therapist, and he did not return for additional treatment. The therapist opined that there
was a potential for Applicant’s condition to adversely impact his judgment and reliability
because  he  suffered  from  a  lack  of  impulse  control  and  did  not  continue  any
recommended treatment for this condition.  (Tr. 29, 32, 56-58, 65, 70-71; AE E)
Applicant testified that in July 2020 he stopped gambling cold turkey, and without
the benefit of continued counseling or a gambling support group. After questioning, he
admitted that he had contacted the treatment center  again in early 2021. When asked
why he made this contact since he reportedly stopped gambling in July 2020, he said he
did  so  because  he does  not  like being told he  cannot do  something or that  he  cannot
overcome  a  personal  problem,  such  as  gambling.  This  all  started  after  Applicant  was
having  a  conversation  with  his  brother-in-law,  an  alcoholic,  and  he  asked  him  why  he
could  not  just  have  one  beer?  Applicant’s  brother-in-law  told  him  the  reason  he  could
not have a beer is due to the same reason Applicant could not gamble again; they were
both  addicts.  Applicant  stated  that  a  part  of  him  wanted  to  prove  his  brother-in-law
wrong and show him he could control his gambling. So in early 2021 Applicant called a
therapist  to  see  if  this  was  a  good  idea,  but  after  he  could  not  get  in  touch  with  the
therapist,  he  decided  it  was  not  worth  it.  He  does  not  intend  to  participate  in  any
additional  counseling  for  his  gambling  problem  because  he  does  not  think  about
gambling anymore. He estimated that overall he lost about $10,000 over the years due
to gambling. (Tr. 71-72, 89-94)
Personal Conduct:
The SOR alleged that Applicant falsified information on his January 2020 security
clearance application (SCA) when he answered “No” to the following question: “Section
21- Psychological  and  Emotional  Health  –  Adversely  Affected:  Do  you  have  a  mental
health  or  other  health  condition  that  substantially  adversely  affects  your  judgment,
reliability,  or  trustworthiness  even  if  you  are  not  experiencing  such  symptoms  today?”
Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his 2019 diagnoses of major depressive disorder
and  gambling  disorder.  (SOR  ¶  3.a)  In  his  SOR  response,  Applicant  denied  this
allegation,  stating  that  he  never  agreed  with  his  therapist’s  diagnosis  of  major
depressive  disorder.  He  was  merely  going  through  an  emotional  period  of  his  life.
Applicant did not address or explain why he failed to disclose his diagnosis of gambling
disorder on the SCA. (Tr. 23-24, 63, 76-78; GE 1, GE 2, GE 8; SOR response)
Under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR  also  alleged  that  Applicant falsified  information  on
his January 2020 SCA in his response to the following question: “Section 26- Financial
Record – Gambling: Have you EVER experienced financial problems due to gambling?”
Applicant answered this question “No” and deliberately failed to disclose that he opened
multiple  lines  of  credit  totaling  $14,000  and  also  spent  approximately  $9,000  of  his
savings  to  support  his  gambling,  which  ultimately  led  to  his  filing  for  Chapter  7
bankruptcy  in  December  2019.  (SOR  ¶  3.b)  Applicant  admitted  this  information  in  his
SOR response, but he denied that he answered the question with the intent to deceive
the government. He made a mistake when he  read the question and failed to disclose
his financial issues developed from his gambling problem.  At the hearing, he admitted
he filled out the SCA before he made the decision to quit gambling altogether. (Tr. 75,
78-79; GE 1; SOR response)
