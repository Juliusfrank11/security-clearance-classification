In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the single allegation that he used
marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from  about  August  2004  to  November  2019.  His
admission is incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  33-year-old  composite  material  worker  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since November 2018. He has never held a security clearance.
Applicant graduated from high school in February 2006. He attended some college
courses in 2018 but did not receive a degree. He has never married and has no children.
When Applicant submitted his SCA, he disclosed that he used marijuana two or
three times a week from about August 2004 to November 2019. He stated that he did not
intend to use marijuana in the future because he had “no desire.” (FORM Item 3 at 32.)
When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in April 2020, he told
the investigator that he first used marijuana from January to April 2014 but stopped while
he was on probation for vandalism from April 2004 to August 2006. He disclosed that he
resumed his marijuana use in August 2006, with his use varying from very infrequent with
multiple  month  breaks  to  two  or  three  times  a  week.  He  occasionally  purchased
marijuana, but he usually obtained it from friends and social acquaintances. (FORM Item
4 at 4.) In his response to the FORM, he stated, “I have never used any substances while
at work on [the contractor’s] property.”
