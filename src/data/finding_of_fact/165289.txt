total amount of the past-due indebtedness was approximately $46,901 as of the date of

Applicant bought a house. He used credit cards to furnish the house and quickly found
himself “over his head” with debt. Applicant found himself unable to pay the credit cards
and the mortgage in 2016. He was able to refinance his mortgage in 2017, but the other

(Government Exhibit 6.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline E: Personal Conduct)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  falsified  material  facts  during  the  clearance  screening  process.  Applicant
admitted the allegations under this paragraph, with qualifications.
Applicant filled out an e-QIP on January 3, 2017. (Government Exhibit 1.) Section
26 of that questionnaire concerned Applicant’s financial record and has several subparts.
As stated in the SOR, with regard to this case, Applicant was asked if, in the seven years
before the date he filled out the questionnaire, he had defaulted on any type of loan, he
had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency, or had an account charged off for
failing to pay as agreed? Applicant answered these questions, “No.”
Applicant stated in his Answer, “I admit to failing to realize that these items were
in collection. I did  know  I was behind  and  trying  to  keep  up  and  I should have  selected
“yes” knowing it was inevitable. When I spoke to an investigator in a face to face meeting
I did tell her about my debt and that I planned on reconciling it.”
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  an  investigator  from  the  Office  of  Personnel
Management on December 6, 2018. The investigator stated in a Report of Investigation:
Subject [Applicant] provided that he has some credit card debt that he did
not list as he was not in debt at the time of filling out the form. Subject got
into debt as he was excited about his home purchase and wanted to furnish
the home and got in over his head with spending. Subject thought he would
be able to make all the payments but his spending quickly added up and
was unable to make all his payments. Subject does not recall details of each
credit card as there is a lot. Subject advised that he fell behind on all credit
cards around late 2016 and did not know what to do. (Government Exhibit
2 at 4; Tr. 31, 40-43.)
During  the  hearing  Applicant  was  asked  why  he  answered,  “No,”  on  the
questionnaire. He stated, “At the time, I didn’t think that I had anything on collections, to
be honest. I don’t really check my credit report, and I should have at the time, and that’s
basically why I put that.” (Tr. 27, 37, 44-45.)
Mitigation

Applicant has received commendations for his work performance. In addition, his
