amount of $25,637. The debts include consumer loans and collection accounts. Applicant

from one state to another for a 2017 job offer that did not materialize; other unemployment

underemployment  for  an  hourly  wage  and  child  support  as  contributing  factors  for  his

on the SOR debts because he borrowed money from friends and family, and wanted to
pay them first. (GE 2) He borrowed about $10,000 from a number of close friends and

he owes money to this rental company. He cleaned the apartment in 2017, and the rental
company refused to do a walk through. He did not file a written dispute with one of the

SOR, however, there were no electronic copies of the debits that he actually made as a
payment. It is not possible to know how many payments, if any were made to the various
creditors.
