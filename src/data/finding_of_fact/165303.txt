Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  60  years  old  and  has  worked  for  a  DoD  contractor  as  a  software
delivery manager since 1997. He has held a security clearance for about 15 years. He
graduated from high school in 1979. He then received a certificate in technology from a
trade  school.  He  married  in  1986,  and  has  four  adult  children,  ages  20  to  32.  He  has
owned his home since 1999. (Tr. at 29, 38-41.)
Applicant and his wife incurred a significant amount of debt over a number of years.
He  and  his  wife  had  overspent  on  non-essential  assets,  which  he  purchased  with
borrowed  money  or  credit  cards.  In  May  2018,  they  realized  they  needed  to  be  more
fiscally responsible and actively manage their debts. They were able to pay their credit-
card debts, but they could not reduce their balances by paying every month. He was using
cash from the sale of investments to pay his credit cards. Also, Applicant’s second oldest
son and his youngest daughter lived at home. Then his oldest son and his wife and their
children moved back into the family home. Applicant’s family situation imposed significant
new financial obligations on Applicant. (Tr. at 15-16, 18, 28-38; GE 2 at 2.)
In May 2018, Applicant  hired a credit-counseling company to help him manage
the debt. The advisor instructed Applicant to close all of his credit-card accounts and to
stop paying the accounts as the first step to negotiate settlements. The advisor, however,
only resolved one debt in a six-month period, and Applicant stopped working with that
company. In August 2018, he began working with a law firm (the Firm) to help him resolve
the debts listed in the SOR. He has also sold off non-essential assets to reduce his debts.
(Tr. at 15-16, 18, 28-38, 62-63; GE 2 at 2; AE C; AE D; AE E.)
Applicant testified that as of the time of the hearing, only three of the seven SOR
debts remained outstanding (1.a,  1.b, and 1.g).  As  noted below,  six of  the debts were
unpaid at that time. He has the funds to pay these debts. He has a net monthly remainder
of about $1,500. He invests ten percent of his salary in his 401K plan, which has a value
of more than $525,000. He has about $500,000 of equity in his home. (Tr. at 35, 83; AE
R.)
SOR Allegations
Paragraph  1,  Guideline  F  - The  SOR  sets  forth  seven  allegations  regarding
Applicant’s  unpaid  consumer  debts.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  each  of  the
allegations. The details regarding each of the delinquent debts are as follows:
1.a  Account  charged off in the  approximate  amount  of  $4,706  – On the advice
of his first advisor, Applicant stopped paying this credit-card account in May 2018. After
the hearing,  Applicant entered  into a settlement agreement under which  he would pay
$1,883 in full settlement of this debt. He provided a copy of that agreement and proof of
payment on September 7, 2021. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 42-44; GE 3 at 5; GE 6 at
12; AE DD; AE EE.)
1.b Account charged off in the  approximate amount  of  $2,601  – On the advice
of his first advisor, Applicant stopped paying this credit-card account in May 2018. After
the hearing,  Applicant entered  into a settlement agreement under which  he would pay
$825 in full settlement of this debt. He provided a copy of that agreement and proof of
payment on September 7, 2021. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 44-46; GE 3 at 5; GE 6 at
12; AE FF; AE EE.)
1.c   Account   charged  off  in  the   approximate  amount   of   $17,393   –   The
Government’s most recent credit report reflects that this credit-card account was paid in
January  2021,  and  the  account  was  closed.  Applicant  provided  several  documents
confirming that this debt was resolved in January 2021 prior to the issuance of the SOR.
He resolved this debt without the assistance of either of his two advisors by paying the
creditor’s collection  agency  $7,827. The final payment was on January 11, 2021. This
debt is resolved. (Tr. at 24, 31, 46-52; GE 3 at 5; GE 6 at 11; AE F; AE Z; AE AA; AE
BB; AE CC.)
1.d Account  charged off in the  approximate  amount  of  $29,889  – On the advice
of  his  first  advisor,  Applicant  stopped  paying  this  credit-card  account  in  May  2018.
Applicant testified that he has also recently been advised by his lawyer at the Firm that
this debt is no longer “collectible” due to being outside the applicable statute of limitations.
He provided as an exhibit information suggesting this account was only collectible for a
period of three years. As noted above, he was provided an opportunity to supplement the
record after the hearing. This additional time gave him the opportunity to seek a resolution
of  this debt and  two  others similarly  situated  if  he  decided  that such steps would provide
mitigation   of   the   security   concerns  raised   by   these   unpaid   debts.  In   his   post-hearing
submission, Applicant  commented  that he  had  “no  updates to  report”  on  this debt and  the
debts  alleged  in 1.e  and  1.f,  below.  This  debt  is  not  resolved. (Tr. a
t 52-57;  GE  3  at  2-
3; GE 6  at 11; AE I;  AE X.)
1.e  Account  charged off in the  approximate  amount  of  $22,530  –   This unpaid
credit-card debt with  the  same  bank  as  the  debt in  1.d,  above,  is in  the  same  posture  as
1.d. This debt is not resolved.  (Tr. at  57; GE 3 at 3-4; GE 6 at 10; AE I; AE X.)
1.f  Account  charged off in the  approximate amount  of  $5,897  –  This unpaid
credit-card debt with  a  different bank than  the  debts  in  1.d  and  1.e, above, is in the  same
posture  as  1.d.  This  debt  is  not  resolved.  (Tr. at  57;  GE  3  at 7; GE  6  at  11; AE  I;  AE  X.)
1.g  Account  charged  off  in  the   approximate  amount   of   $11,272   –   The
Government’s most  recent credit report in  the  record  reflects  that this account  has  been
placed  with  a  collection  agency  and  that  Applicant disputes  this  account. He  testified  that
he  has recently  asked  the  Firm  to  negotiate  a  settlement of  this account.  As of  the  hearing
date, he  had  not  made  any  payments on  this debt. After the  hearing, Applicant provided
a   letter  from  the   Firm,   dated   September  7,  2021,  stating   that  it  has  presented   to   the
creditor’s collection  agency  Applicant’s allegation  that  the  creditor may  have  committed  a
violation   of  the   Fair   Debt   Collections   Practices  Act.  The   letter  advised   that  the   Firm   is
waiting for a response  “on a resolution of the  matter.”  This letter seems inconsistent with
Applicant’s testimony  that  he  asked  the  Firm  to  negotiate  a  settlement.  In  a  separate  letter
from  the  Firm,  dated  May  6, 2021, Applicant’s attorney  advised  that the  Firm  has  been
representing   Applicant   with   respect  to   this  debt  and   others  listed   in  the   SOR  since
September 2018.  After three  years of inactivity in resolving  this debt,  the   Firm  is  only  now
seeking   to   dispute   this  debt   under  an   unspecified   legal  theory.   As  of   the   close   of   the
record, Applicant was waiting  for the  creditor to  respond.  He also wrote  that he  has  made
“efforts to pay  off  [the] debt since  August 9th  hearing.”  This  debt  is  not  resolved.  It has
also been disputed.  (Tr. at 58-60; GE  3 at  3, 4; GE 6  at 12; AE Y; Hearing Ex. V.)
In  addition  to  the  above  debts,  a  credit- card  issuer  had  obtained  a  judgment
against Applicant and his wife in September 2019 in the amount of $32,570. The creditor
then put a lien on Applicant’s home. With the help of the Firm, he settled this debt and his
wife’s delinquent credit card account with the same card issuer prior to his February 2020
background interview.  In addition, he made monthly payments to  settle another credit-
card debt in the amount of $4,880. He paid $43,500 to settle these debts. None of these
accounts are alleged in the SOR.  (Tr. at 33, 60-62; GE 2 at 3; AE G; AE H; AE V; AE W.)
Applicant attached to his Answer a letter from the Firm, dated May 6, 2021, one
day before the date of his Answer, addressed “To Whom It May Concern” advising that
he is exercising his rights under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Consumer Credit
Protection Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, and a regulation promulgated by the Federal
Reserve Board. The letter advises the recipient of the letter to “take into consideration the
above-enumerated  facts  while  considering  credit  with  your  company.”  Applicant
submitted a second copy of this letter with his post-hearing submission, but he failed to
explain what relevance he believed the letter has to this security clearance proceeding.
(AE B; AE X; AE TT.)
Applicant and his wife are now living within their means and are beginning to save
even  more  for  investment  and  retirement.  He  provided  evidence  of  the  sale  of  certain
assets and the payment of collateralized loans to reduce his expenses. He also submitted
Certificates of Title for five vehicles evidencing that he owns the vehicles without a lien or
any  debt.  Other  documents  submitted  by  Applicant  reflect  that  he  has  an  “unvested”
interest in his employer’s public stock with a value of over $345,000 and  vested shares
worth about $28,000. With his post-hearing submission, he provided a summary page in
which  he  made  the  statement  that  he  continues  to  receive  credit  counseling  from  the
attorneys at the Firm and has not made any large purchases or incurred any new credit
card debt. (Tr. at 16; AE J; AE N-S; AE X.)
