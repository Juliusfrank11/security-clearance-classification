In  Applicant’s  answer,  he  admitted  the  allegation  in  the  SOR.  He  also  provided
some  explanation  for  his  conduct.  I  adopt  his  admission  as  a  finding  of  fact.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact. (Item 2)
Applicant  is  55  years  old.  He  is  married  with  two  children,  ages  18  and  11.  He
has worked as a scientist for his current employer, a federal contractor, since 1988. He
holds  a  bachelor’s  degree.  He  has  held  a  top  secret  security  clearance  since  2003.
(Item 3)
The SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana in August 2020, while having access
to classified information. (Item 1)
In  his  October  2020  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  Applicant  admitted
using marijuana in August 2020, while he held a security clearance. In January 2021, he
admitted  to  a  defense  investigator  that  he  used  marijuana  on  the  one  occasion  in
August of 2020. He described his action as taking two puffs of a marijuana cigarette in
his  home.  His  wife  had  obtained  the  marijuana  from  a  friend.  He  also  stated  he  was
experiencing  stress  from  being  locked  down.  He  admitted  to  the  investigator  that  he
used  marijuana  one  other  time  30  years  ago.  In  his  SOR  answer,  he  claimed  that  his
August 2020  use  of  marijuana  “was the  only time  that I have  ever used  any controlled
substance.” (Items 2-3)
Applicant claimed he was unaware of his company’s  drug policy. He also stated
his  intent  was  not  to  use  illegal  drugs  in  the  future.  He  claimed  not  to  associate  with
people  who  used  drugs  and  stated  his  wife  does  not  do  so  either.  Since  Applicant
submitted  this  case  for  an  administrative  determination,  I  was  unable  to  judge  his
credibility based on demeanor. (Items 2-3)
