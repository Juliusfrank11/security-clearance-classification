Applicant is 50 years old. He is applying for a security clearance for the first time.
He has a bachelor’s degree that was awarded in 2011. He also has several professional
certifications. The most recent information available indicates that he is married for the
third time with a three-year-old child. (Items 3, 4)
The  SOR  alleges  23  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $57,000.  The  debts  are
established through Applicant’s admissions and a January 2021 credit report. (Items 2-
5)
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  difficulties  to  a  2019  layoff  after  a  downturn  in
the  industry  in  which  he  worked.  He  stated  that  his  employment  has  stabilized  since
2019, as has his finances. He is paying his current bills and increasing his credit score,
but  he  does  not  intend  to  pay  his  delinquent  debts.  A  financial  counselor advised  him
not to pay the debts because the debts would fall off of his credit report faster if he did
not pay them. (Items 2-4)
