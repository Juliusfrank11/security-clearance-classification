Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR except ¶ 1.x. After a thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 59  years old.  He served  in the  military  from 1980  to  2000  and  retired
in the  paygrade  E-7.  He  married  in  1981  and  divorced  in 1997. There  are  no  children  from
the   marriage.  He  remarried   in   2013   and  has  three   stepchildren,   a   15-year-old  and   13-
year-old twins.  Applicant holds a  bachelor’s degree  and  is close  to  completing  a  master’s
degree. He has been  continuously  employed  by  a  federal contractor since  April 2013. (Tr.
15-18)
Applicant explained  his financial difficulties began  after he  married  in  2013. He  said
shortly   after they  married, he   and  his wife   opened  multiple   credit accounts.   He   greatly
underestimated   the   amount   of  expenses   associated   with   three   children.   Two   of  the
children  have  special needs. His wife  does not  receive  child  support for the  twins because
their   father  was   in  the   United   States  illegally   and   his  whereabouts  are  unknown.  The
eldest   child   also  does   not   receive   child   support.  Applicant’s  wife   returned   to   school   in
2012  to  earn a  degree  in health  care administration  to  get a  better job.  After they  were
married, she  became permanently  disabled and  could not work. Due  to  the  timing  of  her
disability,  she   does  not  receive   Social  Security   disability   benefits.  Applicant’s  salary   is
approximately   $112,000  and  his military   pension  is approximately   $14,400. Applicant’s
wife’s  student  loans  (approximately   $77,000)   were  forgiven   due   to   her  disability.  He
admitted  that  his  poor financial  planning  is responsible  for his  financial problems. (Tr.  18-
21, 38-39, 41)
In   approximately   2015,  Applicant   began   falling   behind   on   his  accounts.   He
contacted  a  credit-counseling  service in March  2015, but their  proposed  payment plan
was more than  he  could  afford. He contemplated  filing  bankruptcy, but wanted  to  pay  his
debts.  He  sold   timeshare  contracts  he   owned   to   increase   his  cash   flow.  In   2017,  he
relocated  to  a  new  state  that  did  not  have  state  income  taxes,  the  weather  was therapeutic
for his wife,  and  there were more government benefits available for the  children. (Tr. 21-
22)
Applicant admitted that he has 25 delinquent debts that are alleged in the SOR.
He disputed the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.x ($175) and testified it was removed from his
credit report. He also testified that the past-due student loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.l and
1.m (total balance: $88,095 and $18,467 respectively) have been refinanced and are in
a deferred status. He testified he stopped attending school in 2014, and he has not made
any  payments  toward  these  debts  in  the  last  seven  years.  He  testified  he  plans  on
repaying his student loans by using an income-based repayment plan, after he pays his
delinquent  debts.  The  total  amount  of  the  delinquent  debt  he  owes  is  approximately
$31,892, excluding the three above accounts. (Tr. 34-38)
Applicant provided exhibits to document that he began making payments of $150
a month in April 2019 on the delinquent debts alleged in SOR  ¶¶ 1.c ($2,866) and 1.h
($824) to the same creditor. The payments were made through an automatic withdrawal.
He said that he decided to pay first the creditor that had the largest balance and then he
will work his way through the remainder of his delinquent debts. He said for some reason
after approximately nine months the payments stopped. He had to restart the payments.
The debt was for a military credit account, so his tax refund was applied to the debt. The
payments  will  continue  until  January  2022.  Applicant  believed  the  current  balance  is
around $1,500. (Tr. 22-23, 29-33; AE B)
Applicant provided documentary evidence that the judgment alleged in SOR ¶ 1.aa
($832) was paid through a payment agreement that was completed in April 2019. (Tr. 26-
27; AE D)
Applicant  provided  documents  to  show he  is  making  payments  on  a  settlement
agreement  reached  in  response  to  a  lawsuit  filed  by  a  creditor.  He  indicated  the  case
went  to  mediation  and  the  amount  the  creditor  alleged  was  reduced.  This  debt  is  not
alleged in the SOR (amount of debt to be paid is $1,777 plus court costs of $243) and will
not be considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered in the whole person
analysis and in mitigation. The last payment due is September 2021. (Tr. 23-26; AE C)
Applicant testified that his wife has some “low-level” credit cards in her own name
that are being paid timely. (Tr. 40) They own two vehicles (2019 and 2020). At the end of
the month he estimated he has a couple hundred dollars remaining. He has no savings
or investments.
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he indicated that he was making payments on
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b. When questioned about its current status, he stated at the time he
completed his answer to the SOR he was making payments. He is not currently making
payments and does not know the account’s status. He estimated that his out-of-pocket
medical  expenses  are  approximately  $4,000  annually.  Applicant  also  stated  that  he
reached  out  via  email  to  another  counseling  service  in  early  2020  about  establishing
payment plans for his debts, but due to the pandemic shutdown he did not follow up on
it. He does not have a budget. He indicated his wife was not receptive to cutting expenses.
He  testified  that  he  intends  to  pay  his  debts.  Other  than  the  accounts  noted  above,
Applicant has not had any contact with the creditors of the remaining delinquent debts,
and he is not making any payments towards these debts. (Tr. 33-34, 41-53)
