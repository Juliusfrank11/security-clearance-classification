Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 45 years old. He earned an associate’s degree.  He married in 2001
and  divorced  in  2014.  He  has  two  children  from  the  marriage,  ages  16  and  10.  He
remarried in 2020. His wife has two grown children, one who lives at home with them.
(Transcript (Tr.) 65-66, 70-72; GE 1)
Applicant enlisted in the Navy in 1995 and was granted a waiver to enlist due to
drug  use  and  a  gun  charge.  He  was  granted  a  security  clearance  at  some  point.  He
testified that after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the military was reducing
the number of its security clearances, and because Applicant had been granted a waiver
to  enlist,  a  government  investigator  interviewed  him.  Applicant  disclosed  to  the
investigator that he had used marijuana while on active duty in the Navy.  In May 2004,
the Department of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility (DON CAF) issued him a letter
of intent to revoke his security clearance. He had an administrative hearing and the Navy
Personnel Security Appeal Board upheld the revocation. Tr. 19, 66-70)
During  Applicant’s  April  2018  background
interview  with  a  government
investigator,  his  prior  revocation  was  discussed.  The  investigator  confronted  Applicant
with the May 2004 revocation letter from the DON CAF, which stated his clearance was
revoked due to his failure to mitigate drug involvement concerns. Applicant explained that
because he needed a clearance to perform his duties, he could not reenlist in the rate he
was in, so he completed his enlistment and was honorably discharged in 2005. (Transcript
(Tr.) 65-69; GE 1, 2)
After his discharge from the Navy, Applicant worked for a federal contractor from
approximately August 2005 to July 2010. He was unemployed from approximately July
2010 to March 2011. He was employed by non-government companies from March 2011
to February 2013. He began employment with his present employer, a federal contractor,
in March 2013 and has worked there since then. (GE 1)
Applicant and his wife filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in June 2011. He attributed it to
his reduced income after his military discharge and letting his wife handle the finances.
He  disclosed  $120,025  of  unsecured  nonpriority  claims;  $1,187  of  unsecured  priority
claims; and $5,002 of secured claims. His Schedule E-unsecured priority claims were for
2008 and 2009 unpaid state taxes. His Schedule F-unsecured nonpriority claims included
multiple  vehicle  debts,  cellular  services,  medical,  library,  attorneys’  fees,  credit  cards,
other consumer debts, and a garnishment. His debts were discharged in June 2011. (Tr.
26, 87-89; GE 4)
In 2015, while employed with a federal contractor, Applicant applied for a security
clearance. It was denied in approximately May 2016, due to his finances at the time. (Tr.
28, 84-86; GE 2)
Applicant completed a security clearance application in October 2017. Question
26 asks about his finances and whether he had failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other
taxes in the past seven years. Applicant answered “no.” It also asked about other financial
delinquencies, whereby Applicant disclosed some of his delinquent debts. (GE 1)
Applicant answered government interrogatories in June 2019. In them he disclosed
he failed to timely file his 2016 federal tax return (SOR ¶1.d). He stated the reason was
because he was concentrating on delinquent accounts on his credit report and he forgot
to file. (GE (2) He also stated:
I  attempted   to   file   the   return  but  misunderstood   TurboTax.  When   it  said
finished  and  completed, I thought it was sent to  the  IRS. When  I looked  at
it again recently  it actually  said it was complete  but I had  to  mail  it in.  So  I’m
in the process of  doing it now. (GE 2)
Applicant’s 2016 federal tax transcript shows that his 2016 tax return was filed in
September  2019.  It  showed  he  had  a  balance  of  $5,635  owed  as  of  August  2021.
Applicant also disclosed that he filed his 2016 state tax return on June 15, 2019. He did
not owe taxes for that year. He disclosed that he owed $92 for his 2018 state taxes. SOR
¶ 1.f alleged that Applicant owed delinquent state taxes for tax years 2014 and 2018 in
the total amount of $562. Applicant provided documents showing that he paid this debt in
September 2019. (Tr. 21, 30-34; Answer to SOR; AE J)
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e alleged Applicant owed $5,459 for tax year 2014; $9,779
for tax year 2015; and $4,002 for tax year 2018. Applicant disclosed in his interrogatories
that he failed to pay his 2015 and 2018 federal income taxes and owed $9,780 and $4,002
respectively. He indicated that he had recently initiated a payment plan with the IRS, and
he would be required to pay $250 a month, but at that time it had not yet started. The
interrogatory did not ask about his 2014 tax debt. (Tr. 31; GE 2)
Applicant testified that after receiving the SOR, he contacted the IRS and made a
payment agreement. He said he began a payment plan with the IRS and has made timely
payments. He provided a document that shows he owes $4,577 for tax year 2018; $5,622
for tax  year 2016 and $6,317 for tax  year 2015. He  explained  that  the  reason  he  had  tax
debts was because  he  did not have  sufficient amounts withheld from  his income  because
he  was having  difficulties paying  all  of  his expenses  after his  divorce. (Tr.  22, 29-32, 72-
81; AE A)
Applicant  did  not  provide  a  copy  of  an  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS.  He
provided an IRS payment activity history document. It shows he made two payments in
2018  applied  to  the  balances  owed  2014  and  2017  tax  years;  six  payments  in  2019
applied to tax years 2014, 2019 and 2020; ten payments in 2020 applied to tax year 2014;
and in 2021 he made payments from January to June, which were applied to tax years
2014  and  2015.  Applicant’s  tax  transcript  for  tax  year  2016  shows  an  installment
agreement was established in June 2019, but it was stopped in February 2020. No other
information was provided as to the status of an existing installment agreement. (Tr. 23;
AE A, K)
Applicant’s 2020 tax year transcript reflects he has a zero balance owed as of April
2021. His 2019 tax year transcript reflects he has a zero balance owed as of June 2021.
His 2018 tax year transcript reflects he owes $4,596 as of August 2021. His 2017 tax year
transcript  reflects  a  zero  balance  owed  as  of  April  2018.  His  2016  tax  year  transcript
reflects he owes $5,635 as of August 2021. His 2015 tax year transcript reflects he owes
$6,002 as of August 2021. His 2014 tax year transcript reflects he has a credit or $258
as of March 2021. (AE F, G, H, I, J, K, L)
Applicant attributes his financial problems to his 2014 divorce. The divorce decree
provided  that  Applicant’s  wife  would  be  responsible  for  the  car  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.g
($16,956) even though the car was titled in Applicant’s name. She defaulted on the loan.
I find in Applicant’s favor on this debt. (Tr. 25-26, 28, 34-40
The  creditor  for  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.h  ($7,695)  obtained  a  judgment  against
Applicant in July 2017. Applicant testified that he has been making payments through the
court ordered garnishment for the past three years. He provided a document showing that
the judgment was satisfied in May 2021. The debt is resolved. (Tr. 34-42; AE C, D, E)
According  to  their  divorce  decree,  Applicant  and  his  ex-wife  were  to  split  the
amount owed on the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i ($2,798). He testified that he was told by
his ex-wife that she paid the debt. He failed to provide any supporting documents that he
paid his share or the debt is resolved. The debt is reported on his March 2019 credit report
as in collection. The date of last activity was July 2012. It is not reported on his June 2021
credit  report.  It  is  unknown  if  this  debt  was  removed  because  it  was  older  than  seven
years, but as of March 2019 it had not been paid, which was five years after Applicant’s
divorce. Without documentary corroboration, it is unresolved. (Tr. 42-43; GE 6, 7)
Applicant  testified  that  the  debt  owed  in  SOR  ¶  1.j  which  was  past  due  in  the
amount of $154 in August 2019, on a balance owed of $1,162 was settled for a payment
of  $370  in  April  2019.  Applicant  provided  a  copy  of  his  bank  statement  to  show  he
transferred  $370  to  the  creditor.  His  June  2021  credit  report  shows  that  the  debt  was
charged off and settled for less than the balance owed. The debt is resolved. (Tr. 43-46;
Answer to SOR; GE 7)
Applicant stated  that the  medical debts  in SOR ¶¶  1.k ($317) and  1.n  ($297) are
duplicates. He stated  all  of  his debts to  this creditor were paid in full. The  debt in SOR ¶
1.k is listed  on  his March 2019  credit report with  a  date  of  last  activity  as July  2013. The
debt in  SOR ¶ 1.n  is listed  on  his October 2017  credit report as a  collection,  and  date  of
last   activity   is  July   2017.  These   debts   are   not  listed   on   his  June   2021   credit   report.
Applicant stated  he  would provide  documentary  proof  of  payment to  show  the  debts were
duplicates  and  paid.  He  did not.  It  is unknown  if  the  debts were removed  from  his most
recent credit report due to  their age.  They are unresolved. (Tr. 46-48; GE 6, 7)
The  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.l  ($270)  had  a  balance  owed  on  a  repossessed  vehicle.
Applicant  testified  that  he  paid  the  debt.  The  credit  reports  indicate  the  account  was
refinanced, paid, and closed. The debt is resolved. (Tr.  48-50; GE 6, 7)
The medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.m ($737) was paid in December 2017. It is
resolved. (Tr. 52; Answer to SOR)
Applicant  testified  that  after  receiving  the  SOR  and  being  confronted  with  his
delinquent debts, he is now aware of how important it is to be financially responsible and
he has acted responsibly and has not overextended his finances. Applicant has a loan
from his 401K pension plan that he is repaying. He took the loan to pay bills. He has not
participated in financial counseling. (Tr. 61-64, 75-76)
Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered
for disqualifying purposes. It may be considered in mitigation, when making a credibility
determination, and in a whole-person analysis.
