Financial Considerations
Applicant’s spouse was unemployed from December 2017 to December 2020. (Tr.
18-19) Applicant had medical issues in 2011 and 2013. In 2011, he had surgery and was
hospitalized for four days. (Tr. 21-22) He had health insurance in 2011, and his medical
debts in the SOR are not from his surgery in 2011. (Tr. 22) In 2011, he lost his employment
at a call center due to medical issues, and he was unemployed for about four months.
(Tr. 22, 25) For several years after 2011, he was underemployed in minimum wage jobs.
(Tr. 26)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.g allege that Applicant had seven delinquent medical debts
totaling $22,823 for the following amounts:  $8,421; $517; $151; $3,477; $1,382; $4,844;
and $4,031.  (HE  2) His  debts resulted from medical treatments  at the  same  hospital’s
emergency room. He received medical tests, such as CAT scans, MRIs, X-rays, and an
endoscopy. (Tr. 20, 23) In 2015 or 2016, Applicant borrowed $5,000 and used the funds
to pay some of medical debts which were not listed on the SOR. (Tr. 28, 30, 49) He paid
the debts when the creditors said they would take him to court. (Tr. 30)  He repaid the
$5,000 loan. (Tr. 49) After Applicant received the SOR, he contacted the medical entity
and  he  learned  there were  14  medical  debts,  and  he  also  learned  the  total owed  was
$30,461.  (AE  B) The creditor  offered  to  settle  the  debt  for  $6,692.  (Tr.  27;  AE  B) The
debts were accumulated from August 19, 2010 ($6,649), to January 29, 2019 ($103). He
indicated he made five payments totaling $617 toward five of the medical debts for $276,
$40, $95, $103, and $103. (AE B) The $276 payment matches the $1,382 debt in SOR ¶
1.e, and he is credited with mitigating this debt. The other four paid debts he paid are not
listed on the SOR. He provided receipts showing three payments totaling $534 as follows:
April 11, 2021 ($135); August 12, 2021 ($296); and September 9, 2021 ($103). (AE C)
Presumably the $534 total is included in the $617 amount. He indicated at his hearing the
medical debt  was  now $6,396.  (Tr.  27,  29) Most  of  his delinquent medical debts  have
been dropped from his current credit report. (GE 6)
When  the  COVID-19  epidemic  began,  Applicant  applied  for  and  received  a
mortgage  forbearance,  and  the  amount  of  his  Federal  Housing  Administration  (FHA)
mortgage went from $150,000 to $163,000 as the deferred interest payments were added
onto the mortgage. (Tr. 32-33) His monthly mortgage payment was $1,200. (Tr. 45) His
student loans are in a COVID-19 deferral. (Tr. 40) Applicant’s annual income is $56,000,
and  his  spouse’s  annual  income  is  about  $20,000.  (Tr. 47-48)  Applicant  is making his
required payments on two vehicle loans. (Tr. 39; GE 5) His state and federal income taxes
are  current.  (Tr.  41)  He  has  $19,500  in  his  401(k)  account,  about  $1,700  in  a  stock-
investment account, and about $1,300 in his savings account. (Tr. 42, 49) He has not had
financial counseling. (Tr. 45) He uses a budget to manage his payments. (Tr. 44)
Applicant’s budget indicates his family’s net monthly income is $5,350, his monthly
expenses  are  $2,980,  and  his  net  monthly remainder  is  $2,370.  (AE  D)  Applicant  has
about  $1,400  extra  each  month  because  of  the  deferment  and/or  forbearance  in  the
payment of his mortgage and student loans, and he used the extra funds to repair his car
($2,000), and to buy a computer, dishwasher, washer, and dryer. (Tr. 43, 48) He also paid
a few bills. (Tr. 48) He received $2,000 or $3,200 from the federal government for COVID-
19 relief, and he used the funds to pay credit card debt and some other debts. (Tr. 50)
Applicant’s 2019 federal income tax return indicates he and his spouse’s adjusted
gross  income  (AGI)  was  about  $65,700,  and  his  federal  income  tax  refund  was  about
$3,700. (AE E) His 2020 federal income tax return indicates he and his spouse’s AGI was
about $61,000, and his federal income tax refund was about $3,600. (AE F)
