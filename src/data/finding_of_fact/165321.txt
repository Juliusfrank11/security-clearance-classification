seeking  a  security  clearance.  She  has  worked  full-time  since  January  2016.  She

(Tr. 27-30; Gov 1)
Guideline F, Financial Considerations:
On  July  13,  2018,  Applicant  submitted  a  security  clearance  questionnaire.  A
subsequent  security  clearance  background  investigation  revealed  Applicant  had  the
following  delinquent  debts:  a  $17,764  charged-off  debt  as  a  result  of  a  voluntary  car
repossession (SOR ¶ 1.a: Tr. 11-16; Gov 2 at 5; Gov 3 at 4; Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 4); a
$100 delinquent medical account owed to an unidentified medical creditor  (SOR ¶ 1.b:
Tr. 16-17; Gov 4 at 2); a $221 delinquent medical account (SOR ¶ 1.c: Tr. 17-19; Gov 5
at  3);  and  it  is  alleged  Applicant  filed  for  bankruptcy  under  Chapter  7  in  May  2005.
Applicant’s  dischargeable  debts  were  discharged  in  July  2005.  (SOR  ¶  1.d:  Tr. 20-21;
Gov 6).
Applicant testified that she is currently more financially stable. She understands
the  importance  of  paying  her  bills  on  time.  She  has  a  much  better  paying  job.  She
previously  struggled  financially.  She  would  pay  her  debts  based  on  priority.  She  is
current on all of  her credit card accounts. She has a budget and does not exceed her
living expenses. (Tr. 24-25)
The status of the debts alleged in the SOR are:
SOR  ¶   1.a:  $17,764  charged-off  automobile  repossession  debt:  Applicant
purchased and took out a car loan in 2012. She returned the car in July 2017 because
she  was  having  difficulty  making  payments,  partially  due
to  her  periods  of
unemployment.  The  car  also  needed  repairs.  Before  surrendering  the  car,  Applicant
tried to re-negotiate the terms of the car loan. She was not eligible for refinancing based
on her credit history. A financial counselor advised her to voluntarily surrender the car.
She  was  unaware  that  she  still  owed  money  after  the  car  loan  was  charged  off.  She
assumed  it  would  only  affect  her  credit  rating.  She  admits  to  receiving  some  letters
regarding the car after returning the car to the dealer. Applicant testified that if she had
to  do  it  over,  she  would  have  paid  more  attention  to  interest  rates  and  communicate
more with  the  creditor. The  debt remains  unresolved  at the  close  of  the  record. (Tr. 11-
16, 33-40; AE B  at 31)
SOR ¶  1.b: $100 delinquent medical debt:  Applicant is not sure what this debt is.
She believes it was a debt owed to a medical laboratory. She believes she paid the debt
and the debt is no longer alleged in her credit report. The debt is resolved. (Tr. 16-17,
48; Gov 1-4; AE B)
SOR  ¶   1.c:   $221  delinquent  medical  account:  Applicant  believes  this  debt  is
related  to  an  annual  medical  screening.  The  medical  office  performed  an  additional
procedure without her authorization. She disputed the amount that she was charged for
the additional procedure. She decided to resolve the account on August 20, 2021. The
debt is resolved. (Tr. 17-19 48-51; AE A at 1-4)
SOR  ¶   1.d:  Chapter  7  discharge  in  2005:  Applicant  purchased  a  home  in  2005
without  understanding  the  responsibilities  of  owning  a  home.  She  could  not  afford  the
mortgage  payments  and  the  home  went  into  foreclosure.  Her  home  was  eventually
foreclosed.  She  does  not  believe  there  was  a  deficiency  judgment.  Her  dischargeable
debts were discharged.  (Tr. 20-21, 51-53; Gov 6)
As  a  single  mother,  Applicant  struggled  to  pay  her  bills.  Her  financial  situation
has  improved  with  her  current  job.  She  resolved  many  accounts  over  the  years.  She
does not live above her means. She has $8,000 in savings. She purchased her current
car, a 2014 model, in 2017 for $15,000.  Two weeks ago, the car’s engine broke down,
resulting in a $5,650 repair bill. Applicant refinanced the car so she could afford the car
repairs.  The  balance  owed  before  the  refinance  was  $11,800.  After  refinancing,  the
balance on her auto loan is $17,500. Early in her ownership, she missed two payments,
but was able to catch up on the payments. She set up an electronic payment plan and
her car payments are current. (Tr, 27; 41-44)
Applicant  is  current  on  her  state  and  federal  taxes.  (Tr.  27)  She  also  has  a
$25,000 student loan, which is currently suspended as a result of the pandemic. (Tr. 46)
Guideline E, Personal Conduct:
Under  Personal  Conduct,  the  allegations  consist  of  Applicant’s  five  charges  of
Driving while on a Suspended License. Specifically, the charges include an offense on
June 2016 (SOR ¶ 2.a: Gov 7 at 1); an offense on March 2015 (SOR ¶ 2.b: Gov 8); an
offense in August 2011 (SOR ¶ 2.c: Gov 9); an offense in December 2010 (SOR ¶ 2.d:
Gov 10); and an offense in September 2008 (SOR ¶ 2.e: Gov 11).
Applicant  states  that  her  license  was  suspended  each  time  for  failing  to  pay
traffic  tickets.  She  admits  that  she  neglected  to  pay  the  traffic  tickets.  Most  of  the
suspensions  related  to  her  failure  to  pay  speeding  tickets,  but  one  suspension  was
because her car insurance policy had expired. Applicant has not had a traffic violation or
license   suspension   since   June   2016.   She   now   understands   the   importance   of  paying
her bills on time.  She intends to make sure this never happens again.  (Tr. 21-24, 54-61)
