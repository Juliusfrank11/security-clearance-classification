The  SOR  alleges  that  the  Applicant  is  indebted  to  the  state  and  Federal
Government for delinquent tax owed for years 2012 through 2015, failure to file his state
and  Federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2016  and  2017,  and  sixteen  delinquent
debts owed to creditors totaling approximately $106,125.  Applicant admits each of the
allegations set forth in the SOR.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated October 24, 2018;
September  5,  2019;  January  7,  2021;  and  June  29,  2021,  confirm  the  indebtedness.
(Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6, and 7.)
Applicant served in the U.S. Marine Corps from March 1996 to March 2001, and
received an honorable discharge. (Government Exhibit 3.)  Applicant began working for
his  current  employer  in  November  2016.  He  has  had  consistent  employment  since
then, with no period of unemployment.
In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  attributes  his  financial  problems  to  the
emotional,  mental,  and  physical  aftermath  of  the  death  of  two  of  his  sons  in  2012.
Evidence in the record suggests that Applicant’s financial problems began  prior to  and
were  unrelated  to his sons deaths, as a $42,463 Federal  tax lien was  entered against
Applicant in March 2012.  Applicant states that since then, his wife has been unable to
return  to  the  workforce  full  time.  Applicant  has  been  and  continues  to  be  the
household’s primary breadwinner.  In 2013, through no fault of his own, his employment
contract changed and drastically recued his income, but not the taxes owed.  Over the
past  nine  years,  Applicant  has  consistently  been  unable  to  meet  his  financial
obligations.  The following delinquent debts set forth in the SOR are of security concern:
