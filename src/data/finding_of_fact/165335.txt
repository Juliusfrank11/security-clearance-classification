The  SOR  contains  two  allegations  identifying  missing  federal  and  state  tax
returns for tax years 2010 through 2019 (SOR 1.a and 1.b) that Applicant did not file, eight
allegations  (SOR  1.c  through  1.j)  identifying  federal  and  state  taxes  owed,  and  two
allegations  identifying  delinquent  commercial  accounts  (SOR  1.k  and  1.l).  Applicant
admitted all allegations with brief explanations.
Applicant is 40 years old and single. Except for one year, she has lived with her
parents since 1981, and has never paid rent. (Tr. 42) She received an Associate’s degree
in computer information science in May 2009. From 2004 to September 2016, she was a
contract security officer. She was a customer service manager in 2017 before becoming
a program analyst in July 2018, a position that she still occupies currently, even though
her employer has changed several times. Her e-QIP discloses no period of unemployment
between 2009 and 2017. (GE 1 at 12-19) She seeks continuation of her clearance which
she has held since 2007. (GE 1 at 10-33; Tr. 6-15)
In  her  July  2018  e-QIP  (GE  1),  Applicant  admitted  that  she  had  neither  filed
federal or state tax returns, nor paid taxes for tax years 2010 through 2017. She explained
that she had no excuse and conceded no action had been taken to fix the tax problem.
(GE 1 at 35) She recalled that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed an unalleged tax
lien against her in 2012, because of unpaid taxes from tax year 2009. That lien will be
addressed in the whole-person section of this decision. Concerning the two commercial
debts appearing at SOR 1.k and 1.l, Applicant explained that no action had been taken
because of low pay. (GE 1 at 38)
In her April 2019 PSI, Applicant confirmed that she had not filed the missing federal
and  state  tax returns  for 2010  through  2017. She  indicated  that  she  wanted  to file  the
returns  but  never  “got  around  to  it.”  (GE  2  at  8)  She  did  not  mention  a  social  anxiety
disorder  that  stopped  her  attempts  to  file  returns.  She  noted  that  she  had  made  no
arrangements  to  resolve  the  federal  debt  but  considered  contacting  a  tax  lawyer.
Regarding the two commercial accounts, Applicant explained that she used the two credit-
cards  extensively  while  she  was  unemployed  from  September  2016  to  March  2017.
Surprisingly, her July 2018 e-QIP, shows continuous employment from February 2009 to
July 2018.  (GE 1  at  12-17)  As  to  debt  SOR  1.k,  the  collection  agency  had  filed  a  civil
action seeking a judgment. Applicant tried to enroll in a payment plan but the payments
were  too  high.  (GE  2  at  9)  She  claimed  that  she  was  repaying  the  SOR  1.l  debt  in  a
monthly payment plan.  She presented no documentation substantiating participation in
the plan or resolution of the debt. She conceded making poor financial decisions earlier
in her life like over spending and purchasing a timeshare in 2009. (GE 2 at 9)
In her September 2020 responses to interrogatories (GE 2), Applicant provided
a graph to show action taken on the missing tax returns. Though she provided no IRS
account  transcripts,  she  must have  obtained assistance from a  tax preparer, since the
graph discloses years she owed taxes and years she was due a refund. The graph has
five columns. Reading the graph from left to right, in the second and third columns, she
indicates that she “filed” all missing tax returns, including missing tax returns for tax years
2018 and 2019, on September 17, 2020. However, she explained on the next page of her
interrogatory responses that the returns had not been filed, only prepared three weeks
before  she  submitted  interrogatory  responses,  but  she  still  had  to  mail  them  to  the
respective tax agencies. (GE 2 at 12) The fourth column displays the amount owed or
“returned.” The fifth column shows that Applicant owes federal and state taxes for 2012
through 2015. The sixth column indicates that no payment plan was established for either
tax agency. (GE 2 at 11) The graph also does not reveal additional penalties and interest
imposed for filing the returns after the deadlines. (GE 2 at 11-12)
At the September 2021 hearing, Applicant explained that even when she started
doing  her  own  taxes  at  about  25  years  of  age  (circa  2005),  she  was  still  receiving
assistance from another person who abruptly stopped assisting her. (Tr. 27) Her inability
to find assistance from another source caused her to stop filing tax returns. An additional
reason is that she has an ongoing history of social anxiety that has frustrated her efforts
to address her yearly tax obligations. (Tr. 27) She conceded that she had no legitimate
explanation  for  not  filing  the  returns  from  2010  through  2019.  (Tr.  37)  Though  she
provided no proof, Applicant claimed that she mailed the returns during the week before
the hearing. The only tax returns Applicant filed were those for tax year 2020, which she
filed following the September 2021 hearing. The electronic transmission of those returns
shows  a  federal  tax  refund  of  $193,  and  a  state  tax  refund  of  $43.  After  the  hearing,
Applicant called the IRS information center and was advised that it could take up to 12
weeks to process the requested information for the other listed tax years. Applicant also
indicated the state tax agency official could only retrieve Applicant’s 2018 returns. (Tr. 28,
31; AE 6, 10)
Applicant settled the SOR 1.k credit-card debt for $5,000 following garnishment
of her wages for a period of time that is difficult to ascertain from her testimony. (Tr. 29,
54-56;  AE  1)  She  claims  that  the  SOR  1.l  credit-card  debit  was  paid  off  when  her
payments  were  completed,  and  before  she  received  the  SOR.  (Tr.  53)  However,  she
provided no documentary proof as she had to establish that SOR 1.k was resolved. (Tr.
56)
Applicant  was  asked  whether  she  had  a  budget.  She  replied  that  she  had  a
mental budget that was not written out. Then she indicated that she prepared  a budget
on her computer. (Tr. 50) Her definition of a budget was not spending beyond a certain
amount  of  money  earmarked  for  spending.  (Tr.  51)  No  written  budget  was  presented.
Applicant has never had financial counseling. She testified that “I have never been really
the type to ask for help and I know that I should.” (Tr. 51) During the April 2019 PSI, she
indicated that she wrote a note to the OPM investigator describing her plan to resolve her
smaller  bills  first  and  then  tackle  the  larger  ones.  Using  that  approach,  Applicant
successfully paid off her car six months ahead of schedule. (Tr. 42, 52; AE 3)
Applicant was asked whether she intends to ask for assistance in correcting her
tax issues. Her reply was ambiguous but she knew that she could rely on her father who
was  experienced  in  financial  matters.  He  is  cognizant  of  Applicant’s  tax  predicament
though she had not formally asked him for help. (Tr. 57-60)
