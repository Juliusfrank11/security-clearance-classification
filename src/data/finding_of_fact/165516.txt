Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since 2016. He is a high school graduate with some certifications.
He is divorced with two children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 29-33; GE 1, 8; AE A, B)
Applicant  owned  a  business  from  about  2005  until  he  closed  it  in  2015.  The
business started to struggle in about 2010, and Applicant did not pay all  of  the payroll
taxes  that  were  owed.  Because  it  was  a  Subchapter  S  corporation,1  Applicant  is
personally  liable  for  the  taxes.  The  IRS  filed  a  $158,470  federal  tax  lien  against
Applicant’s corporation in July 2011. Applicant stated that he did his own books, and the
taxes were not paid by mistake. He stated that he hired an accountant who straightened
out  the  taxes  going  forward,  but  the  IRS  still  wanted  their  taxes,  along  with  penalties
and interest. He asserted that he paid the IRS more than $100,000 over the years. He
stated that he believes he owes about $50,000 for the payroll taxes. He did not provide
any  supporting  documentation.  He  stated  that  the  IRS  was  not  actively  collecting  the
taxes. (Tr. at 18-23, 26, 28, 33-39, 61-62; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3, 8, 9)
Applicant  has  not  filed  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2011
through 2015. He filed his returns for 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2020 on time. His 2018 tax
returns  were  not  filed  on  time  because  he  was  in  the  hospital.  They  are  now  filed.  In
March 2019, he still owed the IRS $2,550 for tax year 2017. He stated that he  paid the
2017  taxes,  and  he  plans  to  file  the  back  returns.  (Tr.  at  20,  23-27,  39-43,  56-57,  61;

Applicant  had   additional  financial   problems,  primarily   a   delinquent  credit  card
debt   (SOR  ¶  1.d).   A   February   2016   credit  report  lists   the   account  as  current,   with   a
$33,668  balance. Applicant stated  that  it was a  card  that he  used  for his company, but
had   to   personally   guarantee.  A   September  2019   credit  report  shows  the   charged-off
debt   as   $19,904   past  due,   with   a   $36,845   balance.   Applicant   has  not   made   any
payments on  the  account since  February  2016. The  credit card company  has a  pending
lawsuit against  Applicant.   He  stated  that  he  has  unsuccessfully  attempted  to  settle  the
lawsuit and  the  debt,  but he  believes he  will be  able  to  settle  the  matter.  (Tr. at 24,  43-
46; Applicant’s response to  SOR; GE 3-6, 8)
Applicant is only  an  authorized  user  on  the  accounts alleged  in SOR ¶¶ 1.e  and
1.l, and  not  legally  responsible  for the  debts.  The  $62  debts alleged  in SOR ¶¶ 1.g  and
1.m  are duplicate  accounts. The  February  2016  credit report lists four delinquent debts
in  Applicant’s  name:  a   $102   medical  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.i),   an   $85   cable  television   debt
1  S  corporations  are  corporations  that  elect  to  pass  corporate  income,  losses,  deductions,  and  credits
through  to  their  shareholders  for  federal  tax  purposes.  Shareholders  of  S  corporations  report  the  flow-
through  of  income  and  losses  on  their  personal  tax  returns  and  are  assessed  tax  at  their  individual
income  tax  rates.  This  allows  S  corporations  to  avoid  double  taxation  on  the  corporate  income.  S
corporations are responsible for tax on certain built-in gains and passive income at the entity level. See

(SOR  ¶  1.j),  a  $100  medical  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.k),  and  a  $65  telecommunications  debt
(SOR ¶ 1.m). (Tr. at 47-50; GE 4-6)
Applicant admitted that he owed the remaining debts alleged in the SOR, but he
stated  that  he  thought  he  paid  most  of  them.  He  is  disputing  several  debts.  Several
debts  have  fallen  off  of  his  credit  report,  but  he  submitted  no  documentation  of  any
actual payments. With the exception of  his taxes and the large credit card debt that is
the  subject  of  litigation,  his finances  are  much  better  than  they  have  been.  The  credit
report obtained in August 2021 does not provide anything of value because it indicated:
“Consumer  Requested  Security  Freeze  on  His/Her  Credit  File  –  Report  Unavailable.”
(Tr. at 50-53, 56-58; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 4-7; AE B(1), B(2), C)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
February 2016. He reported that he did not file tax returns and pay  taxes, and that he
owed  “$125,000  (Estimated)”  for  payroll  taxes  from  “2012  (Estimated).”  He  did  not
report any additional financial  problems.  According to  the  February 2016  credit  report,
there  were  only  four  small  debts  that  he  may  have  been  required  to  report.  Applicant
denied intentionally providing false information about his finances on the SF 86, and the
evidence does not establish an intentional falsification. (Tr. at 53-56; GE 1, 4)
