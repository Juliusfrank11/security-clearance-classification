Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  60  years  old  and  has  worked  for  a  U.S.  defense  contractor  as  an
engineer since August 2015. He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps at the age of 18 and
served honorably for 21 years (1979-2000). He then earned a bachelor’s degree in 2003.
More recently, he started taking courses with a view towards earning a master’s degree,
but he has not pursued that further. He has married and divorced twice (1980-2001 and
2002-2008).  He  and  his  second  wife  separated  after 3  years  of  marriage.  He  has  two
adult children, ages 37 and 38. (Tr. at 20-21.)
While serving in the Marine Corps, Applicant deployed a number of times, including
several deployments to war zones. He experienced service-related post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD). He has declined treatment of his condition by the U.S. Department of
Veterans  Affairs  because  he  believes  that  its  doctors  place  too  much  emphasis  on
medications. He sees a private therapist occasionally and is taking some medication for
his condition. He suffers from depression and is inclined to procrastinate in doing some
tasks, or as he wrote: “not taking care of things and letting them go.” (Tr. at 22-24; GE 6
at 15.)
Applicant has held a security clearance for 21 years while in the Marine Corps and
for 15 years as a civilian contractor. The CAF issued an SOR to Applicant in 2013 (2013
SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines F and E (Financial Considerations and
Personal Conduct). A DOHA Administrative Judge granted Applicant continued eligibility
for access to classified information in a decision dated September 30, 2013. (GE 8.)
The current SOR (2019 SOR) again alleges security concerns under Guideline F.
Three of the four allegations in the 2019 SOR are similar to five of the allegations in the
2013  SOR.  These  allegations  in  the  2013  SOR  relate  to  Applicant’s  failure  to  file  his
federal and state tax returns for tax years (TYs) 2009-2011, his failure to pay his federal
and state taxes in TYs 2009-2012, and his failure to pay a student loan. (GE 8 at 3, 5.)
The details of each of the allegations in the 2019 SOR are as follows:
SOR Allegations
1.a   Failure   to   file   and/or  pay   Federal  income   taxes   in  TYs   2008-2016   –
Applicant testified that he has filed all of his Federal tax returns for the years alleged. He
submitted the returns to the IRS  on his own without professional help. He hired a tax firm
to file his 2017 return, which it did. The tax firm was supposed to review his tax returns
for the prior years and file amendments to reduce his taxes, if appropriate. The firm never
did that, and he stopped working with them. At the time he filed his Federal returns, he
had not paid all of the taxes he owes. He has not made any payments to the IRS since
then, other than through a bankruptcy proceeding for about two years in the 2013–2015
period, as discussed below. (Tr. at 25-42, 51; AE A at 2.)
The  CAF  sent  Applicant  interrogatories  asking  him  to  provide  his  IRS  Account
Transcripts for TYs 2008-2017. He provided with his responses, dated in March 2019,
summary account information only for the TYs 2009, 2012, and 2014. He provided wage
and income transcripts, which do not contain the relevant information, for TY 2010. The
IRS records reflect that he failed to file his tax return in 2009 and filed late in 2012 and
2014. The IRS summary account records also reflect that Applicant owes taxes for each
of these three years, $11,100 (TY 2009), $408 (TY 2012), and $4,778 (TY 2014). (GE 6
at 3, 15, 21-23, 26-30, 32-37, 40-42, 45-52.)
As of the date of the hearing, Applicant had no idea how much he owes the IRS
for past-due taxes. In September 2020, over one year after he received the SOR, he hired
a second tax firm to help him sort out his tax liabilities and to file his 2020 tax return, as
well as his returns for TY 2018 and 2019. He has not yet filed those returns. The new firm
is also supposed to create an installment payment plan for Applicant to pay his  unpaid
taxes. As of the close of the record, that had not happened. (Tr. at 25-42, 51-51; AE A at
2 .)
1.b Failure  to  file  and/or pay  state income  taxes  in TYs  2008-2015  –  Applicant
testified that he timely filed all of his state tax returns for TYs 2008-2015 when he filed his
Federal returns. He testified that he has also filed his returns for TYs 2016 and 2017. He
provided no documents evidencing the filings or when the returns were filed. As of the
hearing date, he had not filed his state tax returns for TYs 2018-2020. As noted, he has
hired a new tax advisor to file these returns and to review his old returns.  In his Answer,
Applicant admitted that he has not paid all of his state taxes for TY 2008 to 2015. (Tr. at
42-51; GE 5 at 3; AE A at 2; AE F.)
The record evidence reflects that the state filed as many as three tax liens against
Applicant, though Applicant believes there have only been two liens. The first one was
filed  in  December  2010  in  the  amount  of  $3,250.  The  Government’s  September  2016
credit  report,  GE  5,  reflects  that  this  lien  was  paid  in  July  2012.  It  likely  covers  tax
deficiencies  for  TY  2009  or  earlier.  Applicant  incorrectly  wrote  in  his  responses  to  the
CAF’s interrogatories that this lien was for his 2016 taxes, which post-dates the filing date
of the lien. A second lien was filed on July 18, 2017, in the amount of $9,067. Applicant
believes  that  this  lien  covers  all  the  tax  years  prior  to  2015.  Applicant  wrote  in  his
interrogatory responses  that  the  state  first  garnished  his  wages  in  August  2018  in  the
amount  of  $597  per month,  but  the  amount  was  later  reduced  to  $125  per  month.  He
testified that this garnishment has ended and the lien was paid off in 2020. The state has
issued another garnishment, and likely a third tax lien, which is not in the record, for taxes
owed in TY 2018 and 2019. The state takes about $300 per month from Applicant’s wages
under this garnishment. Applicant is unaware of the amount of his current tax debt, but
he estimates that the total amount of the garnishment is about $10,000. The garnishment
will end in three years. Applicant has paid and is paying his state tax deficiencies since
TY 2008 through involuntary garnishments. Even as recently as 2019, he has not paid
his state taxes, as required. (Tr. at 42-51; GE 5 at 3; AE A at 2; AE F.)
1.c   June  2013   Chapter  13   bankruptcy,   converted  to   a   Chapter   7   bankruptcy   and
discharged in November 2015  –  Applicant filed a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter
13 on June 28, 2013, in which he sought to pay his delinquent Federal and state taxes
through  his  bankruptcy  repayment  plan  over  five  years.  He  listed  on  Schedule  E  his
unsecured priority claims, which consisted of Federal tax debts of $11,641 for TY 2010,
$9,770 for TY 2011, and $5,270 for TY 2012, totaling $26,682. He also listed state tax
debts of $1,930 for TY 2010, $1,998 for TY 2011, and $1,894 for TY 2012, totaling $5,822.
On Schedule F, he listed two student loans, one for about $10,610 and a second one for
$114. Four months earlier, the DoD issued the 2013 SOR in which it alleged that Applicant
owed past-due Federal taxes for TY 2009-2012 in the total amount of $41,802 and state
taxes for TY 2009-2012 in the total amount of about $6,668. Applicant admitted each of
these debts in the earlier DOHA proceeding. (Tr. at 51-53; GE 7 at 15, 19; GE 8 at 5.)
The  Bankruptcy  Court approved  Applicant’s Chapter 13  repayment plan  on  August
21, 2013. In  his September 20, 2013  decision, the  DOHA Administrative  Judge  granted
Applicant’s security  clearance  renewal application  under the  then  applicable adjudicative
guidelines,  writing   that:  “Applicant  has  submitted   substantial  evidence   to   show   that  he
has filed a  Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which will repay  all  of his past-due  debts in full  within
five  years . . .  . Applicant has made  arrangements to  pay  his tax  indebtedness through
his bankruptcy   plan.” He concluded  his decision  with  the  comment   that:  “Applicant has
had   financial  problems  for  several  years,  which   are   now   being   resolved.  He  currently
shows good  judgment with  regard to  his debt.  In my  opinion, he  will continue  to  exercise
such judgment in the  future.” (GE 7  at 2; GE  8 at 8-10.)
On December 13, 2013, Applicant’s employer was ordered under the Chapter 13
bankruptcy  plan  to  deduct  the  payments  from  Applicant’s  wages  and  forward  the
payments  to  the  Trustee  for  further  distribution  to  Applicant’s  creditors.  Applicant’s
Chapter 13 plan provided for him to repay 100% of his debts to all of his creditors over a
five-year period. (Tr. at 52-53; GE 7 at 1, 4.)
Less  than  two  years  into  the  five-year  repayment  plan,  Applicant  converted  his
Chapter  13  bankruptcy  to  Chapter  7  on  August  27,  2015.  Under  Chapter  7,  Applicant
obtained a discharge on November 24, 2015, of his unsecured non-priority debts totaling
$62,819, less his student loans, which were not discharged. His past-due taxes were also
not discharged, though a portion of them may have been reduced by his payments under
his  Chapter  13  plan  during  the  period  from December  2013  to  August  2015.  After the
conversion of the bankruptcy proceeding to Chapter 7, Applicant asked his tax advisor to
help set up a payment plan with the IRS. That did not happen. Applicant has never been
able  to  determine  how  much  his  Federal  tax  debt  was  reduced  by  his  Chapter  13
payments. The limited IRS tax account records Applicant submitted to the CAF reflect five
payments made through the bankruptcy proceeding during the period March 2015-June
2015 totaling $5,302. (Tr. at 52-53; GE 7 at 1, 4.)
Applicant chose to convert his Chapter 13 bankruptcy to Chapter 7 because he left
his employment by mutual agreement with the employer. His bankruptcy attorney advised
him  to  make  the  conversion  because  it  was  uncertain  when  he  would  find  new
employment and be able to continue making his Chapter 13 payments. (Tr. at 53-60.)
1.d  Charged-off credit-card account  in the  amount  of  about  $710 – Applicant
opened this account in February 2016 and defaulted on it in August 2016. He is not aware
of this account. Applicant suggested that due to a data breach of his credit at Equifax, this
account might be the result of identity theft. He has done nothing to resolve his concern
about the legitimacy of this debt, and if legitimate, to resolve it. (Tr. at 61-66, 76-78; AE A
at 2; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 2 .)
1.e   Student   loan  account   in  collection   in  the   amount   of   about   $10,792   –
Applicant’s  student   loan   account   was  opened   in   2003.   It   became   delinquent   in  about
2016. When  Applicant started  his master’s program, payments on  this loan  were deferred
for about six  months. He has been  making  payments of  about $65  per month  since  then.
His current balance  is about $6,000.  This account  is being  resolved.  (Answer; Tr. at  60-
61, 66-73; GE 3 at 2-3; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at  10, 11; AE E; AE  G.)
Applicant testified that he received financial counseling through his bank as well
as the mandatory financial counseling required when filing for bankruptcy. He said that
he prepared a budget and used it for a  period.  He learned that he should stop buying
things that he could not afford. He did not provide any further details. His current annual
income is $111,000. He also receives military retirement and disability benefits of about
$25,000  per  year.  He  prepared  a  budget  of  his  income  and  expenses  in  March  2019,
which reflects a monthly net remainder of $1,710. (Tr. at 74-75.)
