Applicant  was  born  in  Iraq.  He  immigrated  to  the  United  States  as a  refugee  in
1987  because  he  and  his  family  are  religious  minorities.  He  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in
1993. Most of his family have left Iraq, but his sister is a citizen and resident of Iraq. She
remained  in  Iraq  to  help  care  for  her  husband’s  elderly  parents.  (Tr.  at  17-22,  41-42;

Applicant has spent many years since 2003 working under dangerous conditions
in Iraq as a linguist in support of the U.S. mission. He submitted documents and letters
from  U.S.  military  personnel  attesting  to  his  outstanding  service  and  value  to  the
mission.  Applicant  pledged  his  undivided  allegiance  and  loyalty  to  the  United  States,
which  he  considers  his  home.  He  credibly  testified  that  his family  in  Iraq  could  not  be
used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information.  (Tr. at 18-20, 39;

Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  problems.  He  filed  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy
case  in  1997,  and  his  debts  were  discharged  the  same  year.  He  filed  a  Chapter  13
bankruptcy case in 2002. The case was dismissed in 2003. Applicant lost his home to
foreclosure  in  2007.  Applicant  stated  that  the  bankruptcies  resulted  from  back  injuries
and extended time off from work. He asserted that his wife at the time did not make their
mortgage  payments  while  he  was  working  overseas  as  a  linguist.  (Tr.  at  36-38;

Applicant’s family in Iraq and financial issues were the basis of a 2009 SOR and
hearing.  He  received  a  favorable  decision  by  the  Administrative  Judge  in  February
2010,  who  concluded  that  foreign  influence  and  financial  considerations  security
concerns were mitigated.
Applicant  had  additional  financial  problems  within  a  few  years  of  the  favorable
decision.  The  SOR  alleges  the  two  bankruptcy  cases  and  seven  delinquent  debts
totaling  about  $17,080.  The  debts  are  established  by  credit  reports  and  Applicant’s
admissions. The credit reports indicate that the debts became delinquent between 2012
and  March  2014.  Applicant  again  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  his  second  wife,
who  did  not  pay  their  debts  while  he  was  working  overseas.  (Tr.  at  22;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 4-7)
Applicant  has  settled  and  paid  all  of  the  SOR  debts.  The  $5,002  and  $2,379
debts  to  the  same  credit  card  company  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.e)  were  settled  through
payments  in  2018  for  one  account  and  payments  from  2019  to  2020  for  the  other
account. The creditor issued an IRS Form 1099-C (Cancellation of Debt) in August 2020
cancelling  $3,752,  which  is  the  difference  between  the  amount  that  was  owed  the
creditor and what the creditor received from Applicant in settlement of the debt. (AE D)
Applicant  made  his  final  payment  of  $1,846  in  December  2019  to  settle  the
$3,075  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  (AE  F)  He  paid  a  total  of  $2,900,  with  the  last
payment  in  March  2019,  to  settle  the  $3,006  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c.  (AE  U)  He
settled the  $2,600 debt  alleged  in SOR ¶  1.d for an undisclosed amount  in  November
2019  (AE  E).  He  settled  the  $1,016  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.f  for  $609,  which  he
completed through payments in September and October 2019. (AE C, T) He paid $280
in October 2019 to resolve the $455 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g. (AE V)
Applicant’s current finances are sound. He has not accrued  any new delinquent
debts since 2014. He has not remarried. He handles his own finances now. He stated
that online access and payments to accounts are easier than they  used to be, and he
does  not  have  to  rely  on  a  stateside  spouse  to  pay  his  bills  while  he  is  working
overseas. (Tr. at 46-47; GE 7; AE P)
