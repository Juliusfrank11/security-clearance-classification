Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant  did not timely file his
federal income tax returns for the 2010 through 2017 tax years (SOR 1.a); that for those
same  tax  years  he  owed  $325,065  in  delinquent  taxes  (SOR  1.b);  that  he  owed
[REDACTED]  (State  A)  $34,841 pursuant  to a  tax lien filed  against  him  in  2017  (SOR
1.c); and that he owed [REDACTED] (State B) $94,921 for unpaid income tax (SOR 1.d).
Additionally,  it  was  alleged  that  Applicant  owed  $6,437  for  two  delinquent  credit  card
accounts (SOR 1.e and 1.f).
In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanations SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.e
and 1.f. He denied SOR 1.c, claiming the State A tax lien has been satisfied. He denied
SOR 1.d, claiming that the current balance on the State B tax debt is now significantly
lower and that a prior garnishment of his earnings to satisfy the debt has been rescinded.
(Answer)  In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by  Applicant’s  admissions,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  57  years  old  and  works  for  a  defense  contractor  in  a  position  that
requires  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information.  He  was  hired  by  his  current
employer in State A in February 2021 after working between April 2013 and December
2020 at a defense contractor located in [REDACTED] (State C). Prior to that, he worked
for another defense  contractor,  also  in  State  C,  between  August 2006  and  April 2013.
Applicant first received a security clearance in 1982 while serving on active duty in the
military  between  April  1982  and  April  1988,  when  he  was  honorably  discharged.  His
clearance was renewed for civilian work in 1989 and 2002. (GX 1)
Applicant disclosed in his e-QIP that he owed State B $30,000 in unpaid income
taxes because he had not filed his State B income tax returns for the 2012 and 2013 tax
years, and  that  his pay  was being  garnished  to  satisfy  that debt.  He further disclosed  that
State   B   had   placed   a   lien   against   a   house   in  State   B   that  he   and   his  wife   occupied
between  1999  and  2013, when  Applicant relocated  for new  employment in  State  A. State
B  obtained  the  lien  on  Applicant’s house  as part of  its effort to  enforce Applicant’s income
tax  debt. As  a  result  of the  lien,  Applicant  was unable  to  sell  the  house  when  he  moved
to  State  A,  and  the  mortgage  on  that house  was foreclosed  in  June  2015.  Applicant  does
not owe  any  remainder after foreclosure, but  he  did  not explain  why  he  could not stay
current  on   his  mortgage   payments.  In   response   to   the   SOR,   Applicant   provided
information  that showed  his wages were previously  garnished  by  State  B  to  satisfy  a  debt
for unpaid taxes for the  2005  through  2008  tax  years. That garnishment was released  in
March  2018;  however,  another  garnishment  was  implemented   to   recoup   unpaid   taxes
from  the  2010, 2011, and  2012  tax  years.  (Answer; GX  1; GX  2; GX  3; GX  5; GX  6; Tr.
53  –  56)
Applicant’s State B tax debt was actually $94,921. Also, he has not filed his past-
due returns; rather, State B tax authorities filed them without input from him. Applicant’s
pay was involuntarily garnished from 2013 until he left his previous job in December 2020.
After he started his current job in February 2021, he contacted State B tax authorities and
established a voluntary monthly repayment plan which began in March 2021. Applicant
estimates he still owes about $47,000 in unpaid State B taxes. (Answer; AX F; Tr. 50 –
52)
Applicant did not timely file his income tax returns as required in State A, where he
has lived since November 2013, for the 2013 through 2017 tax years. As a result, and as
alleged  in  SOR  1.c,  Applicant  incurred  a  $34,841  debt  for  unpaid  taxes.  The  state
garnished his wages to satisfy that debt. On or about April 13, 2018, Applicant filed all of
his past-due State A income tax returns. He also has timely filed his State A returns since
the 2018 tax year. On April 23, 2018, State A reduced his wage garnishment to 10 percent
of  his  income  at  that  time.  On  June  11,  2019,  State  A  released  the  tax  lien  against
Applicant that served as the basis for the garnishment of his wages. The tax debt alleged
in SOR 1.c has been satisfied. (Answer; GX 1 – 4; GX 9; Tr. 48 – 50, 57)
As alleged at SOR 1.a, Applicant also did not file his federal income tax returns for
the tax years 2010 through 2017. As alleged at SOR 1.b, he incurred a $325,061 debt for
unpaid federal taxes for those years. Available information also documents unpaid federal
taxes for tax years 2006 through 2008. Applicant testified that he has not yet filed any of
the returns addressed in SOR 1.a and he has not made any payments or other attempts
to resolve his federal tax debt despite receiving notice of his unpaid tax debt from the IRS
on March 25, 2019. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; GX 4; GX 7; Tr. 40 – 43, 79)
Applicant asserted that he failed to file his 2010 through 2017 federal tax returns
and his 2013 through 2017 State A returns, because he thought his wife had filed them
as joint returns, when, in fact she filed her own returns as “married-filing separately.” He
did not explain why he did not file his 2006 through 2008 returns, or why he seemingly
was  unaware  during  that  entire  time  that  he  had  not  met  his  federal  filing  obligations.
(Answer; GX 1 – 4; Tr. 85 – 89, 90 – 91)
As  for  his State  B  returns,  Applicant  explained,  but  did  not  corroborate,  that  he
continued to file returns in State C, where he had lived until moving just across the state
line  to  State  B  in  December  1999.  After  moving,  he  continued  to  work  in  State  C and
thought he was supposed to continue filing there. He did not provide any documentation
showing that he continued to file returns in State C after 1999. (Answer; GX 1 – 4; Tr. 85
– 89, 90 – 91)
Since  at  least  2006,  Applicant  has  been  a  salaried  employee  whose  taxes  are
withheld  and reported by his employers. His  annual income  since 2013  has exceeded
$200,000  and,  at  times,  $300,000.  Applicant’s  personal  finances  are  sound  and  he
estimates he has about $8,000 remaining after deducting expenses from his estimated
monthly  net  income  of  $14,000.  In  2014  and  2015,  Applicant  obtained  professional
assistance to resolve his tax issues, first from an accounting firm, then from a law firm. In
both cases, he received information and advice about how to deal with the IRS and state
tax authorities; however, it was not until 2018 that he filed his State A returns. He never
himself filed his past-due State B returns. Until February 2021, all of the payments made
on his state tax debts were through involuntary wage garnishments and, more recently,
state diversion of his timely-filed income tax refunds starting with the 2018 tax year. (GX
4; AX B – E; Tr. 44 – 46, 58 – 70, 76 – 79)
As to the two credit card debts alleged at SOR 1.e and 1.f, Applicant asserted that
they have been paid, that they may be his wife’s responsibility, and that he has no current
information about those accounts. On July 6, 2018, Applicant was asked about both debts
during  a  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  as  part  of  his  background  investigation.  He
indicated then that he thought both accounts were paid but would check on both accounts
and pay them off if they were still past-due. The most recent credit report available, dated
July 3, 2019, shows both debts  have been delinquent since at least 2015 and are still
unresolved. (Answer; GX 1; GX 3; GX 5; Tr. 39 – 40)
Applicant has an excellent reputation in the workplace and his community. Letters
of support submitted by current and former associated who have known him personally
and  professionally  for  up  to  25  years  extol  his  professionalism,  integrity,  and
trustworthiness. (AX G)
