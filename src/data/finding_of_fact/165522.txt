Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 2.b, with explanations. He denied SOR ¶ 2.a.
The admissions are adopted as findings of fact.  After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  48  years  old.  He  has  worked  for  defense  contractors  since  April
2010.  He  worked  for  contractor-one  (C1)  from  2010  to  May  2017;  he  worked  for
contractor-two (C2) beginning in June 2017 and lasting until August 2017 (C2 took over
the contract C1 previously held); and in August 2017, he started working for contractor-
three (C3), for whom he continues to work. He reported in his 2017 security clearance
application  (SF-86)  that  he  held  a  security  clearance  beginning  in  2010.  He  holds  a
bachelor’s  degree  in  electrical  engineering  and  is  currently  working  on  a  master’s
degree. He is single, never married, and has one adult child. (Tr. 31, 38-40, 77; AE1, 3)
The   SOR   alleged,  under  Guideline   J,   that  in  October  2016,   Applicant   was
charged   with   four felony   drug-related   offenses  and   that   he   ultimately   pleaded   guilty   to
one  charge  of  facilitation  to  possess  marijuana  for sale,  a  class  6  felony. (SOR  ¶  1.a)  It
also   alleged,  under  Guideline   E,  the   same   conduct  alleged   under   Guideline   J  (SOR  ¶
2.b)  and   that   he   failed   to   timely   report  his  October   2016   arrest   and   his  May   2017
conviction to  his employer, as required. (SOR  ¶  2.a).
Applicant admitted pleading guilty to the class 6 felony (the lowest degree felony
under  state  law  (See  A.R.S.  §  13-702))  drug  facilitation  charge  on  May  12,  2017.  A
judgment of conviction was entered that day. The arrest that resulted in this conviction
occurred  on  October  21,  2016.  He  was  sentenced  to  six  months’  probation,  fees  and
fines.  He  was  represented  by  a  criminal  defense  attorney  on  these  charges  and  was
advised by counsel not to disclose his arrest to his employer until after a judgment was
entered, which turned out to be May 12, 2017. He successfully completed his probation
and on December 19, 2017, his conviction was set aside. (Tr. 28, 39-40; GE 4; AE J)
The  underlying  facts  that  led  to  Applicant’s  plea  and  conviction  are  that  on  the
morning of October 21, 2016, while Applicant was asleep in his home, law enforcement
personnel  raided  his  home  possessing  a  search  warrant.  A  search  of  an  inoperable
vehicle in his garage resulted in finding a large quantity of marijuana and some cocaine.
Applicant  claimed  he  had  no  knowledge  of  drug  activity  at  his  home.  He  had  recently
been out of town attending a pro football game and his work location was approximately
70 miles from his home  so during the week he  stayed  at  a rented room he had at his
work location. Additionally, he had given out three keys to his house to friends because
he had been burglarized before when he was away.  Despite these facts and upon the
advice  of  his  attorney,  he  entered  into  a  plea  agreement  where  three  charges  were
dismissed  and  he  pleaded  to  the facilitation  charge.  Before  he  agreed  to  the  plea,  his
attorney advised him that because the law of the state created a legal presumption that
home and car owners were presumed to know the contents of their homes and cars, it
would be difficult to win at trial with an argument that he had no knowledge of the drug
activity. (Tr. 45-57)
The  record  contains  no  evidence  of  any  prior  drug  activity  by  Applicant  and  he
testified  that  he  has  not  been  involved  with  any  drug  or  criminal  activity  since  his
conviction in May 2017. (Tr. 50, 82)
To  understand  the  sequence  of  events  as  they  impact  the  allegation  that
Applicant failed to report his arrest and conviction, I find the following timeline existed:
April 2010 to May 31, 2017--Applicant was employed by C1. (GE 1);
October  21,  2016--Applicant  arrested  at  his  home  on  drug  charges.
(GE 5);
After the October 2016 arrest--Applicant’s attorney advised him not to
disclose  the  arrest  until  after  judgment  was  entered  on  his  plea
agreement. (Tr. 59);
May 12, 2017--Applicant pleaded guilty to the facilitation charge and a
judgment was entered against him. (GE 4);
May 31, 2017--Applicant completes a job application and background
check  for  C2,  who  has  replaced  C1  on  the  government  contract
Applicant is working on. In the application, Applicant disclosed that he
was convicted of facilitation and that he was sentenced to six months’
probation and fines. He listed the place of the conviction and offered to
provide more information, if needed. (Tr. 59; AE K);
June 1, 2017--Applicant is hired by C2 (Tr. 79; GE 3 (p.7));
August  1,  2017--Applicant  is  hired  by  C3,  his  current  employer.  No
employment  application  is  offered  into  evidence.  Applicant  testified
that  he  filled  out  an  application,  which  did  not  include  a  request  to
supply  any  criminal  history.  There  was  no  evidence  to  the  contrary.
(Tr. 65-66);
August 2, 2017--C3 is made aware of Applicant’s October 2016 arrest
when  Applicant’s  common  access  card  (CAC)  is  stolen  and  needed
replacing.  The  information  was  apparently  supplied  by  C2  to  the
security  office  of  C3.  Applicant  was  questioned  by  a  C3  employee
about why he could not be issued a new CAC. Applicant disclosed the
October 2016 criminal incident. (GE 2);
August  3,  2017—A  Joint  Personnel  Adjudication  System  (JPAS)
incident report prepared for the database. (GE 2);
December 21, 2017—Applicant completes his SF 86  as an employee
of C3. He details his arrest and conviction in the document. (GE 1)
No evidence was presented nor request for administrative notice made about any
employer rule, procedure, or practice; or government regulation or rule that created the
duty for Applicant to report his criminal history to his employer.
Applicant  presented  evidence  showing  that  he  has  received  numerous  work
awards,  been  selected  for  employer-sponsored  training,  and  his  interim  2019  work
appraisal  stated  that  he  had  an  excellent  work  ethic.  He  is  a  contributor  to  his  local
community, to include providing monetary donations to his church  and by volunteering
to help with disabled veterans’ activities. (AE C-F; SOR Answer)
Applicant  also  presented  character  letters  from  a  work  supervisor,  a  coworker,
two pastors, and two personal friends. They vouch for his professionalism, integrity, and
dependability.  His  work  supporters  request  granting  of  his  clearance.  His  pastors  and
friends describe him as a good person whom they trust unconditionally. (AE L)
