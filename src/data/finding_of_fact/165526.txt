Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since 2015. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2015. He has never
married, but he resides with his fiancée. He does not have children. (Transcript (Tr.) at
13-14, 23-24; GE 1, 2; AE F, G)
Applicant used marijuana a number of times between about 2007 and 2009. He
did not use marijuana again until 2014. He smoked marijuana once or twice from about
October 2014 to June 2015. (Tr. at 14; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 4, 5)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
May 2015 in conjunction with his job offer. He intentionally failed to report his marijuana
use.  He  explained  that  he  filled  out  the  SF  86  on  his  parents’  computer  with  their
assistance. His parents are very religious, and he did not want them to know about his
marijuana  use.  He  also  admitted  that  it  was  the  only  job  offer  he  received,  and  he
thought that it could affect the job offer if he revealed his marijuana use.  (Tr. at 19-20,
28-30; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 5)
Applicant received his security clearance in 2015. He continued to use marijuana
on  an  irregular  basis.  He  used  psilocybin  mushrooms  in  October  2016.  He  used
marijuana  at  the  same  time,  which  was  the  last  time  he  used  any  illegal  controlled
substances. (Tr. at 14-17, 30; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5)
Applicant  interviewed  for  a  position  with  another  company  in  July  2017.  The
position  required  a  top  secret  clearance  and  eligibility  for  access  to  sensitive
compartmented information (SCI). It was at that time that Applicant realized the gravity
of his actions. He looked at brochures from his company, and he discovered he had an
affirmative  duty  to  self-report  his  marijuana  and  mushroom  use.  He  held  off  until
October 2017 in order to complete a program, and he then self-reported his illegal drug
use to his facility security officer (FSO), who reported it to the DOD. He also indicated
that he delayed his self-reporting because he was afraid of losing his job and going to
jail. (Tr. at 30-31, 34; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 5)
Applicant submitted  another SF  86  at his FSO’s request  in  November  2017.  He
fully reported his illegal drug use. He reported that he used marijuana in total less than
20 times. His description of his drug use has been consistent when he was interviewed
for  his  background  investigation  in  2018,  in  his  reply  to  DOD  interrogatories,  in  his
response  to  the  SOR,  and  at  his  hearing.  Applicant  also  told  the  background
investigator that he paid for the services of prostitutes in Mexico in 2015 and 2016. (Tr.

Applicant’s  security  clearance  was  suspended  in  about  December  2017.  In  his
July 2019 reply to DOD interrogatories, he admitted that he engaged the services of a
prostitute  in  Amsterdam  in  June  2019.  (Tr.  at  17-19,  31-34;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 4, 5)
Applicant  was  evaluated  in  December  2020  by  a  licensed  clinical  social  worker
(LCSW), who is also a certified substance abuse counselor, among other qualifications.
She  tested  Applicant  and  interviewed  him.  She  also  had  access  to  the  SOR.  They
discussed  his  substance  abuse  and  interactions  with  prostitutes.  She  concluded  that
there was no diagnosis, and that “[b]ased upon all information available to [her],” it was
her opinion that “[Applicant]  is not at risk of  relapse or return to  his previous behavior.”
(AE A, B)
There  are  inconsistencies  between  Applicant’s  statements  about  his  drug  use
and involvement with prostitutes before and during his hearing and his statements to the
LCSW about those events. She reported that Applicant told her that he used marijuana
twice in 2007 and in the fall of 2008. He did not use marijuana again for about six years
until  2014,  when  he  used  it  once.  He  told  her  that  he  used  it  again  with  psilocybin
mushrooms  in  2016  while  visiting  a  friend  in  a  state  that  had  made  marijuana  legal
under  state  law.  She  stated  in  her  report:  “[Applicant]  reported  that  after  the  trip  to
[State]  he  made  the  conscious  decision  that  he  was  never  going  to  use  substances
again. He returned home and self-reported to his security officer at work.” Regarding his
involvement with prostitutes, she wrote: “[Applicant] received a manual stimulation after
a  legitimate  massage.  However,  the  two  subsequent  engagements  with  paid  sexual
activities  were  not  consum[matt]ed.” This  is  inconsistent  with  his testimony  that  two  of
the encounters involved masturbation and the third involved “oral sex.” (Tr. At 35-37; AE
A)
Applicant stated that he does not intend to use illegal drugs or solicit prostitutes
in  the  future.  He  passed  drug  tests  in  December  2020  and  July  2021.  He  provided  a
signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse,
acknowledging  that  any  future  involvement  or  misuse  is  grounds  for  revocation  of
national security eligibility. He has minimal contact with individuals who use drugs, and
he  will  leave  if  he  finds  himself  in  a  place  where  drugs  are  present.  He  informed  his
fiancée  of  his  drug  use  and  involvement  with  prostitutes.  (Tr.  at  15-17,  19,  23-24,  27;
Applicant’s response to SOR; AE C-E)
Applicant  volunteers  in  his  community.  He  submitted  documents  and  letters
attesting  to  his  excellent  job  performance  and  moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his
reliability, trustworthiness, loyalty, dependability, responsibility, and honesty. (AE H-J, L)
