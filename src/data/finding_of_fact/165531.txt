Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  30  years  old.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2014.  He  has
cohabitated with his fiancée since January 2020. He and his fiancée have a two-year-old
child. Applicant has been employed by a federal contractor since November 2019.  (Tr.
16-20; GE 1)
Before starting his current job, Applicant had periods of unemployment. He was
unemployed from August 2017 to April 2018; from January 2019 to May 2019; and from
August 2019 to November 2019. (GE 1)
Applicant lived with different family members after graduating college. He testified
that  he  contributed  to  the  household  expenses.  He  said  at  times  there  were  six  adult
family members in his parents’ household, and he was the only one working. His parents
asked him to leave their house in February 2019. Applicant’s fiancée was pregnant with
their child at the time. They moved in with her family and later moved back in with his
parents. His mother told him to leave the house in February 2021, and he and his family
were homeless. He and his fiancée now are renting an apartment. (GE 1; Tr. 21-29)
The SOR alleges Applicant has delinquent student loans that total approximately
$39,072. Applicant testified that his mother paid his student loans for a period of time and
then  stopped.  Applicant  did  not  know  what  period  of  time  she  made  payments  or  the
amount of any payments. Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in
December 2019 and disclosed he had $44,396 in delinquent student loans. He disclosed
that he did not have a stable place to live and had difficulty paying his bills. He said he
would start making payments of $100 each month for the next couple of years to satisfy
his student loans. (Tr. 30-39; GE 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  February  2020.  He
acknowledged his student loans and other delinquent accounts. He disclosed the student
loans became delinquent in 2018 when his mother stopped making payments due to a
disagreement  with  Applicant.  He  told  the  investigator  he  would  contact  the  creditor  in
February 2020 and arrange a payment plan of $100 a month. At his hearing, Applicant
testified that after contacting his employer for guidance  on how to address his student
loans,   he   applied   for  a   loan   rehabilitation   program   that  began   in  March  2021,   which
requires he  make  monthly  payments of $5  for nine  consecutive  months. Applicant has
made  monthly  payments  of $50,  and  the  program  will be  completed  in December 2021,
upon   receipt  of  his final  rehabilitation   payment.   Post-hearing,  Applicant  provided   proof
that he  has made  consistent payments of $50  a  month  from  April through  November 2021.
(The   month   of  June’s   payment  receipt  was  missing   from  Applicant’s  documents,  but
because  the  payments  are being  automatically deducted,  I  believe  this was an  oversight.)
(Tr. 31-33; GE 5; AE  F, G, H)
Applicant  believes  that  at  some  point  his  student  loans  will  be  forgiven,  and  he
referred  to  the  program  he  is  participating  in  as  a  loan  forgiveness  program.  Once  he
completes the rehabilitation program, he does not know what his new monthly payments
will be or what period of time he will be required to make payments. He stated that he
was advised that upon completion of the rehabilitation program, at some point, his loans
will be transferred to a new department and a payment schedule will be made. Applicant’s
loan  rehabilitation  application  reflects  a  monthly  income  of  $2,672  and  his  monthly
expense are $3,175. (Tr. 31-39; AE A, B, C)
The  SOR  also  alleges  a  debt  for  a  car  repossession  from  2019  (SOR  ¶  1.c-
$12,569), two medical debts from 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.a-$1,700 and SOR ¶ 1.b-$499) and a
debt for dental services (SOR ¶ 1.k-$710), all in collection. Applicant acknowledged these
debts to the investigator and admitted them in his SOR answer. He told the investigator
that he  intended  to file bankruptcy in  March 2020  to  resolve  his debts and get a fresh
start. At his hearing, he confirmed that his intention was to save money ($1,500) so he
could file bankruptcy to resolve his delinquent debts. He has $300 in his bank account.
(Tr. 69; GE 5)
Post-hearing,  Applicant  provided  a  payment  receipt  of  $25  dated  November  1,
2021,  for  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.  He  stated  that  he  intended  to  make  future  monthly
payments of $25. He provided a payment receipt of $50 dated November 1, 2021, for the
debt in SOR ¶ 1.c and intends to make future monthly payments of $25. In  Applicant’s
post-hearing email, he stated he contacted the creditor for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b, but was
advised that no payments would be accepted because Applicant disputed the account on
his credit report. That matter must be resolved before acceptance of payments. Applicant
said  he  asked  the  creditor  that  the  dispute  be  terminated  so  he  can  start  making
payments. (AE F, I, J)
Applicant  testified that in  February 2021, he hired a person  to  dispute all of  the
debts on his credit report. He pays him $200 a month. Applicant provided documents to
show that every debt on credit reports from the three credit bureaus were disputed, even
debts he knows he legitimately owes. He said he was going to pay the debts he knows
he owes. (Tr. 61-62; AE D, E)
Applicant testified that the week before his hearing, he contacted the creditor for
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k and will make payments toward the debt. Post-hearing, Applicant
provided an email that stated on November 1, 2021, he spoke with  the creditor for the
debt in SOR ¶ 1.k to set up a payment plan for $25 a month. He said he made the first
payment and was waiting for a confirmation receipt. (Tr. 57-60; AE F)
The  debts alleged  in  the  SOR are corroborated  by Applicant’s admissions in his
answer  to  the  SOR,  his  disclosures  in  his  SCA,  his  statements  to  the  government
investigator, and credit reports from April 2021, October 2020, and January 2020. (GE 1,
2, 3, 4, 5)
Applicant testified that he is reducing his expenses and has cut back on eating out.
He is hoping and planning to have a house in  the next five years. He testified that this
past year has made him a man, and he is getting his life together. His fiancée testified on
his behalf and reiterated that they had unstable housing for a period. She is unemployed,
but is looking for a job, and hopes to  go  back to  school to  earn her bachelor’s degree.
She intends to work while pursuing her education. She stated that Applicant has been the
sole provider for the past two years. (Tr. 60-61, 76-83)
