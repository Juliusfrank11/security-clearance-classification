In his SOR answer, Applicant denied all of the allegations. After a review of the
pleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 75-year-old employee of a federal contractor performing the duties
of an engineer. He began working at his present job in June 2019. Applicant retired from
full-time employment in 2010. He remained retired and not working until about 2017 when
he took a part-time job. During his retirement period, he moved to a foreign country to live
part time and where he purchased a home (FH). He was solicited by his current employer
to work for them, because of his engineering background, which he did, starting in 2019.
He earned his bachelor’s degree in 1969. He is twice divorced (2005 and 2008) and was
most recently married in 2011. He has three children (one is deceased), the youngest for
which he pays child support. He has previously held a security clearance. (Tr. 6, 30; GE
1, 5)
The  SOR  alleged  eight  delinquent  accounts  (seven  credit  cards  and  a  medical
debt) totaling approximately $48,000. The debts  are established by credit reports from
August 2019, January 2020, and February 2021. Applicant’s responses in his July 2019
security  clearance  application  (SCA);  and  his  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  with  a
defense investigator in September 2019. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.h) (GE 1-5)
Applicant admitted that he applied for the credit cards and incurred charges using
the cards for renovating his FH. He made payments on all the cards for some time, then
between September and November 2018 he stopped making the payments. His reasons
for doing so were: 1) he was upset that his credit score went down because he used these
cards; 2) he believes the credit cards companies do not follow the law that applies to them
under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C.§ 1681), specifically he alleges they do not
keep  appropriate  records,  they  fail  to  conduct  proper  investigations,  and  they  fail  to
communicate  in  writing  with  complainants;  3)  he  wanted  the  credit-card  companies  to
negotiate a lower interest rate on the cards. (Tr. 32-35, 37, 40-41, 46; GE 1, 5; AE D, F;
SOR Answer)
The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.g-$48,079. These seven credit cards have all been charged off for
nonpayment. Applicant admitted opening the accounts, using the cards to charge goods
and services, paying on the balances up until September through November 2018 when
he stopped making payments. He has not made any further payments. He disputed the
accounts  in  writing  in  August  2019  with  a  credit  reporting  agency.  These  debts  are
unresolved. (Tr. 32-35, 40-41, 43-46, 56; GE 3, 4; AE D, G)
SOR ¶ 1.h-$284. Applicant claimed he disputed this medical debt and it no longer
appears on his latest credit report. The debt was less than seven years old, so it is unlikely
that it was removed from the credit report because it was stale. This debt is resolved. (Tr.
42-43; GE 4)
Applicant has more than sufficient financial resources to  resolve all these debts.
He  chooses  not  to  do  so  based  upon  principle—he  does  not  believe  the  credit  card
companies follow the law and therefore he will not pay them. His net worth is in excess
of  $1  million.  His  gross  yearly  earnings  from  his  job  and  social  security  retirement  is
approximately  $167,000.  After  expenses  each  month,  he  claims  a  remainder  of
approximately $7,800. He testified he had the resources to pay these debts, but he would
have to withdraw money from his investment accounts and incur tax  liability,  which he
would not do. (Tr.39-40, 48-51, 53, 56; AE A-B)
