Applicant is 39 years old. He is applying for a security clearance for the first time.
He married in 2008 and divorced in 2017. He has a nine-year-old child. (Item 3)
The  SOR  alleges  13  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $52,000.  The  debts  are
established through Applicant’s admissions and a January 21, 2021 credit report. (Items
2-5)
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  difficulties  to  a  layoff,  his  divorce,  and  his
mother’s cancer. He was laid off in August 2016 and rehired in December 2017. During
that period, he worked as an Uber driver from August 2016 to February 2017, and for
another company from February 2017 until he left to care for his mother in May 2017.
(Items 2, 3)
Applicant  stated  in  his  response  to  the  SOR  that  since  he  returned  to  work  in
December 2017, he has been working to pay his debts. His first priority was to pay his
back  child  support.  A  July 2020  credit  report lists  a  child  support  account  with  a  state
government.  The  account  was  opened  in  December  2016.  It  was  reported  as  “current
account  –  was  30  days  past  due,”  with  a  $0  balance.  Applicant  stated  that  he  is  now
able  to  focus  on  his  other  debts.  He  stated,  without  corroborating documentation,  that
he  paid  in  full  the  $130  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b,  apparently  after  he  received  the
SOR. Since he did not respond to the FORM, additional information about his finances
was not provided. (Items 2, 5)
