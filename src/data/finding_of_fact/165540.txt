Applicant  admitted  to  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.,  1.b.,  1.d.  and  1.e.  He
denied  SOR  allegation  ¶  1.c.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,
exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  54-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  August  of  2018.  He  has  held  a  security
clearance since about 2010, as Applicant is retired from the U.S. Navy. He is married,
and has three children. (TR at page 14 line 11 to page 20 line 19, and GX 1 at pages 13
and 39.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a. and  1.b. Applicant  admits that he  is indebted  to  the  Department of  Education
in  the   amount  of   about  $42,000.  Applicant   was  making   monthly   payments  of   $410
towards this debt, until  the  Department of Education  put a moratorium on  accepting  said
payments  due  to  the  Civid-19  pandemic.  (TR  at page  20  line  20  to  page  26  line  22,  and
Answer at pages 2~5.) Applicant is ready, willing and able to continue said payments.
1.c.  Applicant denies that he  failed  to  file  his  Federal income  tax  returns for tax
year 2018, and  has submitted  documentation  demonstrating  this filing. (TR at page  26
line 23 to  page 28 line  1, and Answer at pages 6~8.)
1.d.  Applicant  admits   that  he   is  indebted   to   the   Federal   Government,   in  the
amount  of about  $35,000  in  past-due  taxes for tax  years 2015, 2017  and  2018. (TR at
page  28  line  2  to  page  31  line  25,  and  at  page  35  line  16  to  page  37  line  17.) Despite
having  a  month,  post-hearing,  to  submit something  further in this  regard, Applicant has
failed to do so.
1.e.     Applicant  admits   that  he   is  indebted   to   his  state,  in   the   amount   of  about
$11,500  in  past-due  taxes for tax  years 2017  and  2018. (TR at page  32  line  1  to  page
33   line   10.)  Despite   having   a   month,  post-hearing,  to   submit  something   further  in  this
regard, Applicant has failed to do so.
