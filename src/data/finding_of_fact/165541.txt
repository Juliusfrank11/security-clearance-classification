Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 67 years old. He is a high school graduate and has certified apprentice
credentials.  He  has  been  married  since  1983.  He  has  been  steadily  employed  to  the
present, except from November 2006 to January 2007. (Item 4)
Applicant has a history of financial problems. He completed a security clearance
application  (SCA)  in  October 2009.  In  it  he  disclosed  two  delinquent  credit  card  debts
($1,960 and $7,654) and two judgments ($3,839 and $6,020). (Items 3, 4)
In  January 2020, Applicant  completed  another SCA.  In  response  to  Section 26:
Financial Record, he disclosed all of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. He stated
that the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c ($6,801); 1.d ($2,773); 1.e ($1,814); 1.f ($1,207); and 1.g
($1,128) were personal loans that had been turned over to collection agencies. He stated
that each of these debts were delinquent because his wife was laid off from employment
in July 2014. He listed the date the debts became an issue as July 2014. He further stated
that each debt was submitted to a debt relief company (DR) to negotiate a payoff.” (Item
3)
Applicant further disclosed in his SCA the delinquent debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($41,795)
for a 2017 vehicle that he surrendered to the dealership because he was unable to make
the payments. He noted the financial issue began in February 2018. He said the debt was
incurred because his wife was laid off from employment and she became permanently
disabled  and  could  no  longer  work.  The  debt  was  turned  over  to  DR.  Applicant  also
disclosed in his SCA the delinquent debt for medical services in SOR ¶ 1.i and stated he
was unaware this debt was not covered by his medical insurance. It was submitted to DR
to negotiate a payoff (Item 3)
Applicant disclosed in his SCA the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.h ($448) and 1.b ($9,570) to
the same creditor for a time-share contract and fees associated with it. He stated: The
reduced income from his wife’s Social Security could no longer support this payment. The
financial issue began in June 2019 and both debts were submitted to DR to negotiate a
payoff. (Item 3)
Finally,  Applicant  disclosed  in  his  SCA  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.j  ($198)  for  trash
services. He indicated that the reason he was unable to pay it was because his wife was
laid off from employment in July 2014, and it had been submitted to DR. (Item 3)
In Applicant’s July 2021 answer to the SOR, he denied all of the SOR  debts. He
explained that the vehicle he voluntarily surrendered to the creditor (SOR ¶ 1.a) was sold
and $15,795 is the deficiency balance. Sometime after Applicant completed his SCA in
January  2020,  he  hired  Lexington  Law  to  dispute  his  debts.  The  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.a
remains in a charged-off  status  on  Applicant’s credit reports. The  debt  is not resolved.
(Items 2, 3, 5, 6; AE C)
Applicant provided a response to the FORM in which he stated that his wife was
laid off from employment on September 30, 2017. She was then injured while searching
for  work  and  was  declared  disabled  by  the  Social  Security  Administration  effective
October 1, 2017. It is unknown whether Applicant’s wife had two periods of unemployment
as he indicated she was first unemployed in 2014, which caused them financial difficulties.
(AE A, AE E).
Applicant stated in his answer to the SOR that the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b is for a time
share he and his wife purchased. He stated they were pressured into the purchase. It is
unknown when this purchase was made. He requested the contract be canceled after his
wife became disabled. Fees associated with the time share with the same creditor are
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h. He is disputing both debts. In his FORM response, he stated that
SOR ¶ 1.b was removed from his credit report. The debt in SOR  ¶ 1.h remains on his
credit report. It is not resolved. (Item 2, AE A, AE C)
In Applicant’s FORM response, he stated that the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i
and  1.j  were  removed  from  his  credit  report.  Applicant  disclosed  all  of  these  debts  as
delinquent in his 2020 SCA. He did not indicate if they were removed because he paid
them. They were reported on Applicant’s March 2020 and December 2020 credit reports.
They do not appear on the August 2021 credit report provided by Applicant. (Items 3, 5,
6; AE C)
In  Applicant’s FORM  response,  he  stated  that the  debts in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.c,  and
1.e are being  resolved.  He said  that Lexington  Law  is working  to  resolve  the debt for the
repossessed  vehicle  in  SOR ¶ 1.a.  Applicant stated  that he  spoke  with  the  creditor for the
debt  in SOR ¶ 1.c  and  assured  him  that  as soon  as he  was done  paying  $340  on  a  credit
card he  owed  that he  would begin paying  this debt.  He  stated  with  regard to  the  debt  in
SOR ¶ 1.e that it is being reviewed by Lexington Law. None  of these debts are resolved.
Applicant stated in his FORM response that his “debt situation has improved and
continues  to  improve.”  (AE  A)  He  further  stated  that  he  has  taken  all  reasonable  and
responsible means available to him under the circumstances to resolve his debts. (AE A)
