Applicant  is  a  37-year-old  field  service  representative  employed  by  a  defense
contractor  since  March  2020.  He  attended  high  school  from  September  2000  to  April
2003.  He  did  not  receive  a  diploma,  but  received  a  general  educational  development

Applicant attended college from January 2016 to January 2017 but did not receive
a degree. He married in October 2016. He and his wife have no children.
Applicant  was  unemployed  from  the  date  of  his  discharge  from  the  Army  until
December  2009.  He  was  employed  from  December  2009  to  December  2012,
unemployed from December 2012 to April 2013, and employed from April 2013 until he
was  terminated  for  poor  attendance  in  June  2013.  (FORM  Item  5  at  3-4.)  He  was
unemployed until November 2013. He was employed from November to December 2013,
when  he  was  laid  off  and  unemployed  until  January  2014.  He  worked  for  another
employer until he was fired in February 2014 for “talking back” to  a supervisor. (FORM
Item 5 at 3.) He was unemployed until May 2014. He was employed from May 2014 until
August 2015, when he left voluntarily for another job. He was employed from August 2015
until he was fired after a disagreement with a manager in July 2016. He was unemployed
from   July   to   October  2016.  He  was  employed   from   October  2016   to   December  2018,
when   he   voluntarily   left  for  another  position.  He  worked   for  another  employer   from
December 2018  to  October 2019, when  he  was fired  for misusing  a  company  credit card.
(FORM  Item  8.)  His termination  in October 2019  is alleged  under Guideline  F in SOR ¶
1.a  and  cross-alleged  under Guideline  E  in SOR ¶  2.d. He was unemployed  from  October
2019  until he  was hired  by  his current employer  in March 2020.
In addition to Applicant’s misuse of a company credit card, the SOR alleges seven
delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $8,668,  three  of  which  are  delinquent  student  loans
totaling  about  $6,380.  The  debts  are  reflected  in  credit  reports from  August  2020  and
January 2021. (FORM Items 9 and 10) In his answer to the SOR, Applicant attributed his
misuse of the company credit card and delinquent debts to the stress of dealing with his
wife’s mental breakdowns and  suicide  attempts.  He submitted no evidence of financial
counseling. He has not disputed any of the debts alleged in the SOR.
The evidence concerning the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is summarized
below.
