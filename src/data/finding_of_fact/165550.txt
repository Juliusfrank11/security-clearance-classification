Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a government contractor since May 2019.
Applicant attended high school from 1998 to 2000, but did not graduate. He was laid off
from his previous employer in November 2018 and remained unemployed until May 2019.
Applicant is unmarried and has no children. He has never held a security clearance.
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant is delinquent on debts totaling
about $23,688 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.g). The debts alleged are supported by the Government’s
credit reports and Applicant’s Answer, SCA, and 2020 interview summary. He admitted
all of the SOR allegations with explanations. He avers that his current debts are a result
of his unemployment, and his past debts that were paid via a consolidation loan resulted
from underemployment.
Applicant stated in his Answer that all of the debts alleged except SOR ¶¶ 1.b and
1.c were paid or otherwise resolved. He stated that SOR ¶ 1.b was consolidated under
the  consolidation  loan  alleged  as  SOR  ¶  1.c.  With  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant
provided documentation showing he resolved a payday-loan-collection-account alleged
in  SOR ¶ 1.a. Department  Counsel acknowledged  in the  FORM that Applicant’s  credit
report shows SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e have been resolved.
Applicant submitted a partial credit report that shows a series of “closed” accounts,
with  little  other  relevant  information.  In  addition,  he  provided  a  debt  relief  negotiation
agreement  from  May  2021.  In  the  agreement,  Applicant  provided  authorization  for  the
debt relief company to negotiate resolution of two debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c,
comprising a retail credit-card account that was charged off in the approximate amount
of  $570;  and  a  consolidation  loan  that  was  charged  off  in  the  approximate  amount  of
$12,628.  Of  note,  the  debt  relief  company  charged  $2,903  in  “negotiation  fees,”  and
requires  Applicant  to  submit  $300  monthly payments for 30  months,  beginning in  May
2021. No evidence of compliance with these terms was submitted.
Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  delinquencies.  In  2017,  he  applied  for  and
received a debt consolidation loan, totaling $12,927 at 29.7% interest rate, to be applied
toward seven delinquent debts totaling $13,163. Applicant defaulted on repaying this loan
in 2018, and it has since been charged off. The defaulted loan is alleged in SOR ¶  1.c
and remains unresolved. The record reflects that delinquent debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.b,
1.c, 1.f, and 1.g remain unresolved, contrary to Applicant’s assertions in his Answer. No
recent evidence of Applicant’s financial status, credit counseling history, or employment
performance was provided.
