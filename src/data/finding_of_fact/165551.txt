In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 25-year-old service desk technician employed by federal contractors
since June 2017. He has never married and has no children. He served on active duty in
the U.S. Air Force from July 2015 to February 2017 and received an honorable discharge.
He was unemployed from February to June 2017.  He received a security clearance in
February 2015 while in the Air Force, and he received a top secret clearance in November
2018.
The  SOR alleges  a car loan  charged  off for $26,583 (SOR  ¶ 1.a); a  credit-card
account  charged  off  for  $8,633  (SOR  ¶  1.b);  and  a  credit-card  account  referred  for
collection of $4,112 (SOR ¶ 1.c). The debts are reflected in credit reports from September
2020  and  January  2021  (FORM  Items 4  and  5.) In  Applicant’s answer to  the  SOR, he
attributed his delinquent debts to “the hubris of  youth and believing that [he] could take
his  time  with  this  issue.”  He  promised  to  provide  a  detailed  plan  for  resolving  his
delinquent debts.
In  Applicant’s  response  to the  FORM,  he  submitted a  detailed  budget  reflecting
monthly income of $3,800 and expenses of $3,365, and a plan to pay off all his delinquent
debts by March 2023. His budget and payment plan appear to have been generated with
an  on-line  budgeting  tool.  He  promised  to  carry  out  his  plan,  but  he  provided  no
documentary  evidence  of  payments  or  payment  agreements  with  his  creditors.  He
submitted  documentary  evidence  that  he  has  remained  current  on  another  credit-card
account since November 2020. He asserted that he has consistently paid his rent on time
and  promised  to  submit  documentary  evidence  to  support  his  assertion,  but  no  such
evidence was included in his FORM response. He did not submit any evidence of financial
counseling.
