Applicant is 36 years old and married. He and his wife have a 15-year-old daughter,
a 4-year-old son, and 19-month-old son. He received his General Education Development
(GED) in  May 2002,  and  subsequently completed  one  semester’s worth  of  community
college  classes.  He  has  worked  for  defense  contractors  almost  continuously  since
September 2006. Throughout this time, he has also worked second jobs at restaurants
and at a nightclub. Since March 2020, Applicant has worked as a property manager and
equipment  specialist  for  his  current  employer.  He  first  applied  for  a  secret  security
clearance in 2012 and has continuously held classified access since 2012. He completed
his second SCA in January 2018. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 12-14, 21-29, 80)
Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He first used marijuana in 1995, at
the age of ten, when his mother introduced it to him, and used marijuana at the age of 16
for six months. Starting in 2003, when he was 18, Applicant used marijuana three to four
times a month. He stopped using marijuana from 2009 to 2012, when he worked for a
defense contractor that conducted random drug tests. At the hearing, he admitted that he
discontinued using marijuana during this period, because he was fearful of losing his job.
(GE 2; Tr. 48-50, 54, 59, 67-69)
In 2012, Applicant completed a SCA for employment with a new company. This
defense contractor required a pre-employment drug test, but it did not conduct random
drug testing of its employees. Applicant knew that it was against his employer’s policy to
use drugs, including marijuana, and he was aware that marijuana use could  adversely
affect his employment and security clearance status. In his 2012 SCA, Applicant did not
disclose his history of marijuana use, despite using marijuana during the previous seven
years. This issue was not alleged in the LOI; therefore, it is not disqualifying behavior, but
it will be considered within the Guideline E mitigation analysis and whole-person analysis.
(GE 1; GE 2 at 4-5, 23; Tr. 48-50, 54, 59-61, 67-69)
After  his  pre-employment  drug  test  in  2012,  Applicant  resumed  using  and
purchasing marijuana. In his September 2018 background interview, he admitted that he
used marijuana daily after work from 2012 until November 2015. At the hearing, he initially
claimed that  he  “may  have  done  it  a  couple  of  times,  like  on  occasions from  what  [he
could]  remember.” He  eventually  admitted  that  the  information  he  told  the  background
investigator regarding his marijuana use was accurate. (GE 2 at 4-5; Tr. 60)
Starting in November 2014, Applicant worked as a bouncer at a nightclub.  After
leaving work at the nightclub on a Sunday night in November 2015, Applicant was pulled
over  by  the  police,  because  his  license-plate  light  was  out.  The  police  officer  smelled
marijuana  coming  from  his  vehicle  and  asked  Applicant  if  he  possessed  marijuana.
Applicant affirmatively answered, and the police seized a small bag of marijuana from his
pants  pocket  and  three-ounce  bag  of  marijuana  from  his  gym  bag.  At  the  hearing,  he
admitted that he purchased the three-ounce bag from a coworker that night, and he used
marijuana prior to the traffic stop. Applicant planned to give some of the marijuana to his
mother-in-law, but the remainder was for his personal use. (GE 2 at 3; Tr. 32-34, 48-50,
54, 59, 67-69, 71-72)
The  police  officer  who  detained  Applicant,  told  him  to  call  a  specific  police
investigator the next day. Applicant was then released, he was not taken into custody or
arrested. Applicant called the police investigator, who wanted him to provide information
as to where he obtained the marijuana. Additionally, the investigator wanted him to go
undercover to help the police conduct a sting operation. Applicant refused to name his
dealer or provide additional assistance, as he did not want to get “involved.” (GE 2; Tr.
33)
Applicant  stated  multiple  times,  throughout  the  course  of  his  September  2018
background  interview,  that  he  discontinued  his  marijuana  use  following  the  November
2015 traffic stop. He adopted this statement, without any  changes, in his August 2019
response  to  DOHA  interrogatories  and  reaffirmed  that  he  stopped  using  marijuana  in
November 2015. (GE 2 at 5, 22)
In June 2016, Applicant was pulled over by a highway patrol officer, and he was
arrested due to an outstanding warrant related to the incident that occurred in November
2015.  He  was  charged  with  possession  of  marijuana,  in  the  first  degree,  a  felony.
Following  his  2016  arrest,  Applicant’s  defense  attorney  recommended  that  Applicant
participate  in  a  six-week  drug  education  class.  Additionally,  the  prosecution  agreed  to
dismiss  the  charges  (nolle  prosse)  after  Applicant  completed  a  six-month  pretrial
intervention program (PTIP). During the PTIP, Applicant was subject to six random drug
tests, all of which were negative, and he was not diagnosed with a drug use disorder. He
paid  all  associated  fines  and  court  costs.  As  a  result  of  Applicant’s  compliance  and
successful completion of the PTIP, the charges was dismissed. (GE 2; GE 3; GE 4; AE
1; AE 2, AE 3; AE 4; AE 5; Tr. 31-32, 36-45, 58, 77, 87)
Applicant testified that prior to his arrest in June 2016, he  used marijuana three
times a week. He affirmed in his March 2021 affidavit that he used marijuana until June
2016. At the hearing, he was confronted regarding the inconsistent information he gave
to the background investigator during his September 2018 interview. Specifically, that he
discontinued using marijuana in November 2015. He claimed the inconsistency was the
result of confusion. (GE 2; AE 7; Tr. 78-79)
According  to  Applicant, he was able  to  stop  using  marijuana  in 2016, in part, due
to   the   PTIP   and   the   classes   he   received.   He  has  not  attended   drug   counseling   or
Narcotics  Anonymous   (NA)  meetings  since   his  PTIP   program   ended   in  approximately
August 2017. As of  the  day  of  the  hearing, he  intended  to  continue  to  abstain from   all
future marijuana  use  and  provided  a  signed  affidavit  affirming  his intent. (AE  7; Tr. 45, 50-
53, 76-7)
In January 2018, Applicant submitted his  second SCA. He failed to disclose his
involvement with illegal drugs, his 2015 traffic stop and 2016 drug-related arrest, and his
employment  as  a  bouncer  at  the  nightclub.  Applicant  admitted  to  the  background
investigator that he did not list his marijuana use, because he was afraid he would lose
his job. Additionally, he told the background investigator that his criminal defense attorney
told him he could have the 2016 arrest expunged from his record if he went through the
proper steps, but at the time of the interview, he had not taken any action. (GE 2 at 4-5)
At the hearing, Applicant testified that his criminal defense attorney told him that
he was not required to disclose the arrest in his 2018 SCA, because the charges were
ultimately dropped. Upon further questioning, he disclosed that he knew he was required
to report his drug use, regardless of the status of the criminal charges.  Additionally, he
reaffirmed that he was concerned that his drug involvement and arrest he would cost him
his job. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 55-56, 80)
Following both the incident in November 2015 and his arrest in 2016, Applicant did
not notify his employer, a defense contractor, of the issues. He was afraid that he would
lose his job. At the hearing, he testified that he recognized that this was a mistake and a
security violation. (GE 2 at 3; GE 3; Tr. 33-34, 72)
During his September 2018 background interview, Applicant admitted he had not
disclosed his drug use and arrest to his FSO, but he intended to notify them. In his August
2019 response to the DOHA interrogatories, he stated that he disclosed the derogatory
information to his FSO  after he  received  the  interrogatory package.  At  the hearing,  he
claimed he told his FSO about his drug use and 2016 arrest in March 2018, prior to his
background interview. (GE 2; GE 55-56, 60-62, 65-66, 73)
Although his mother-in-law continues to use marijuana, Applicant has made it clear
to her that she cannot use it at his home or around him.  He no longer associates with
anyone  else  who  uses  marijuana.  His  received  a  pre-employment  drug  test  in  2016.
Following a workplace accident, Applicant was screened in 2019, and both of these drug
tests were negative. Applicant testified that he intends to provide truthful and accurate
information regarding his drug and arrest history in the future. (GE; Tr. 34-35, 46-47, 57,
74-77)
