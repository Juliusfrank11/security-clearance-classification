Applicant denied the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through 1.h. She admitted the SOR
allegations in ¶¶ 1.i, through 1.k. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 63 years old. She married in 1974 and divorced in 1988. She has three
adult  children  from  the  marriage.  She  remarried  in  2000,  and  she  has  four  adult
stepchildren. She and her husband adopted two of his grandchildren.  She completed a
doctorate degree in 2021. She also has two master’s degrees (1998, 2015), a bachelor’s
degree (1995), and an associate’s degree (1993). She has been employed with the same
federal contractor since 2002, except for a short period when she was employed by one
of its subsidiaries. She has held her current security clearance since approximately 2012.
(Item 3)
Applicant has a history of financial difficulties that were caused by many events
that were beyond her control. She filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 1994 that was converted
to Chapter 7 in January 1998 and discharged in April 1998. This occurred after Applicant’s
divorce from her first husband. She was left with many marital bills that were to be paid
by her ex-husband and were not. Applicant attempted to pay them through the Chapter
13 bankruptcy, but was unable to do so because of her limited income and supporting her
three children. She earned about $15,000 per year at the time. (SOR ¶ 1.j; Items 2, 7)
Applicant  filed  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  September  2000,  and  her  debts  were
discharged in December 2000. She attributed this bankruptcy to losing her job in 1999
and moving back to her home state. (SOR ¶ 1.k; Items 2, 7)
In  2005,  Applicant’s  husband  was  not  working,  and  her  son,  his  wife,  and  their
three children moved in with them when her son lost his job. Applicant did not earn enough
money to support the household. Applicant and her husband filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy
in October 2005. They completed all of the court approved payments to their creditors
through  the  bankruptcy  trustee,  and  their  debts  were  discharged  in  2010.  (SOR  ¶  1.l;
Items 2, 7, 8)
In  December  2018,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  as
part  of  her  background  investigation.  She  attributed  her  past  financial  problems  to
supporting  her  son  and  his  family  when  he  lost  his  job  and  moved  in  with  her;  her
husband’s  loss  of  his job;  funeral  expenses  as  a  result  of  the  passing  of  her  father  in
2016;  and  medical  issues  in  2010,  2017  and  twice  in  2019  from  her  kidney  failure.  In
addition, her husband suffered a massive heart attack in October 2020. He survived, but
his heart only functions at half capacity. Her family incurs about $13,000 annually in out-
of-pocket medical expenses.
The SOR alleged that Applicant’s student loans were past due. Applicant explained
that she was unaware that they were not placed in a deferred status when she resumed
school.  She  provided  documents  to  show  that  her  student  loans  are  deferred.  The
deferment will expire in April 2022, and she will have to begin paying these loans. The
allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a is resolved in Applicant’s favor. (Item 2; AE A, B)
Applicant  disputed  the  charged-off  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  ($21,950) because  of  the
alleged fraudulent practices of the car dealership. A lawsuit was filed by the creditor and
responded to by Applicant. This debt was settled and paid by Applicant in July 2021. This
debt is resolved. (Item 2, AE C).
The  debt in  SOR ¶  1.c  was for a  repossessed  vehicle  that Applicant purchased  for
her stepdaughter who was to  make  the  payments,  but did not.  In  Applicant’s response  to
the  FORM, she  stated  she  has repeatedly  contacted  the  creditor and  left  messages that
she  wants to  settle this debt, but has not received  a  collection  letter or return call.  Her
August 2018  credit report lists  the  debt  as  a  repossession  and  the  “merchandise taken
back by  grantor/possible balance due.” There  is no  balance  due  noted  on  this entry. Her
May  2019  and  June  2021  credit reports also  note  the  debt as a  repossession, but  the
past-due   amount  and   balance   owed   is  zero.  Applicant  has  attempted   to   responsibly
address this debt. It  does not appear there is a  deficiency  balance. It is resolved. (Items
2, 4, 5, 6; AE A)
Applicant  provided  documents  to  show  that  she  has  a  payment  plan  with  the
creditor in SOR  ¶ 1.d and has been making consistent monthly payments  since  2016.
The current balance owed as of May 2021 is $551.  Based on the payments scheduled,
this debt should be completely paid by November 2021. It is resolved. (Item 2, AE D)
Applicant  denied  she  owed  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.g  ($122),  stating  she  has
repeatedly disputed this debt and never had an account with the creditor. She stated in
her response to the FORM that she requested the credit bureaus remove this account
from her report. It is listed as a collection account on her August 2018 credit report, but it
is not listed on her May 2019 or June 2021 credit reports. The account is resolved. (Items
2, 4, 5, 6, 8; AE A)
The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e ($100); 1.f ($35); 1.h ($1,451); and 1.i ($250) are
medical debts. Applicant denied these debts in her SOR answer. She explained that she
has paid thousands of dollars in medical bills over the years and sometimes some get
missed. In her FORM response, she stated that her credit reports only list these debts as
medical, but do not show the specific medical creditor. Applicant stated she has written
the  credit  bureaus  requesting  the  accounts  be  removed.  She  provided  receipts  for
medical debts she paid to different medical creditors. It is unknown if any are the ones
alleged in the SOR. She stated that she was told by a collection agency that some medical
debts are put on hold because  some providers send bills to collection agencies before
they  receive  their  final  payments  from  the  insurance  companies.  Applicant  has  taken
reasonable action to resolve these debts. (Items 2, 4, 5, 6, 8; AE A, AE E through AE M)
