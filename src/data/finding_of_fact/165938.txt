Applicant partly admitted and denied the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. He
admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.m and 1.n. He denied
the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  1.g,  and  1.l.  After a  thorough  and careful review  of  the
pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  43  years  old.  He  served  in  the  military  from  1996  until  he  was
honorably discharged in 2000. He served in the Air Force Reserve from 2003 to 2007 and
received an honorable discharge. He married in 1998 and has three children ages 27 and
twins age 14. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2011, a master’s degree in 2013, and is
pursuing  a  doctorate  degree. Applicant’s wife  has been  steadily employed since 2003.
Applicant has been employed by the same federal contractor since 2006. (Tr. 17-21; GE
1)
The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016,
2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns. He failed to timely file his state tax returns for
the same tax years, except 2018. Th SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted to the federal
government for delinquent taxes in the amount of $3,043 for tax year 2013; $3,891 for tax
year 2014; $12,186 for tax year 2015; and $3,911 for tax year 2017. (GE 1, GE 2; AE B
through AE I)
IRS tax transcripts from August 2021 reflect that Applicant filed his 2012 federal
tax return in August 2014 (he filed for an extension in April 2013); tax year 2014 was filed
in November 2017; tax year 2015 was filed in November 2017; tax year 2016 was filed in
August 2019; tax year 2017 was filed in August 2019; and tax year 2018 was filed in July
2019. Applicant provided a copy of his 2019 federal tax transcript that reflects he filed his
return  in  February  2021.  Applicant  testified  that  he  has  not  yet  filed  his  2020  federat;
income tax return. Tax years 2019 and 2020 were not alleged in the SOR. Any derogatory
information will not be considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered  in
the  application  of  mitigating  conditions,  in  a  credibility  determination,  and  in  a  whole-
person analysis.) (Tr. 35, 66-68; GE 2; AE B through AE I)
In  response  to  government  interrogatories  from  October  2019,  Applicant  stated
that all of his state tax returns from 2010 to 2018 were filed.  His stated his 2012 state
return was filed in July 2014; tax year 2014 was filed in October 2017; tax year 2015 was
filed in October 2017; tax year 2016 was filed in July 2019; tax year 2017 was filed in July
2019.  State  documents  show  that  these  tax  returns  have  been  filed  and  there  is  no
balance owed. (GE 2)
IRS  tax  transcripts  reflect  that  payments  made  by  Applicant  were  applied  to
delinquent tax years  with  a  balance  owed. If  there  was  an excess,  it  was  applied  to  a
subsequent  year’s  delinquent  taxes.  At  different  times,  Applicant  had  installment
agreements with the IRS, but they were canceled presumably after he failed to timely file
his tax returns in subsequent years. The transcripts reflect payments made and refunds
applied to delinquent balances owed. His 2013 federal taxes were paid through payments
made  in  2019;  2014  taxes  were  paid  by  payments  from  2019  and  2020.  For  tax  year
2015, payments began in late 2020 and have continued into 2021. Applicant’s monthly
payments are $300. The remaining balances owed as of August 2021 are $6,919 for tax
year 2015; $4,535 for tax year 2017; and $1,395 for tax year 2018. (Tr. 40-54; GE 2; AE
B through AE I)
In Applicant’s June 2017 security clearance application (SCA) he disclosed that
he failed to timely file and pay 2014, 2015, and 2016 federal income taxes. He anticipated
he owed $2,000 for each tax year. He stated:
Spouse thought that entire process was automated and forgot to complete
the final documentation for processing. Discovered the last week of April.
Appointment made with tax preparer to bring all filing  information current.
(GE 1)
In July 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator as part of
his  background  investigation.  He  explained  that  he  was  aware  of  his  tax  situation.  He
explained that there was a misunderstanding between him and his wife, each thinking the
other had timely filed the tax returns for each year. He told the investigator that his wife
had never handled any of their financial matters in the past and was unfamiliar with the
process.  Both  he  and  his  wife  are  extremely busy  with  their  own  careers.  As  soon  as
Applicant was made aware of the tax situation he immediately called his accountant who
handled the filing of their tax returns and made arrangements with the IRS and his state
to  make  monthly  payments  until  the  balances  owed  were  paid  in  full.  He  had  every
intention of meet his financial obligations now and in the future. (GE 2)
Applicant testified and affirmed that the reason he did not timely filing tax returns
was due to a miscommunication with his wife.  He thought she filed the taxes, and she
thought he did. He testified that they never discussed who was going to file the tax returns.
In the past, an accountant prepared their tax returns. Applicant normally was the person
who brought their tax information to the accountant for preparation of the return. He did
not do this for the delinquent tax years alleged. Someone did file for an extension in April
2013  for  tax  year  2012  and  in  April  2014  for  tax  year  2013,  which  was  not  alleged.
Applicant denied he was the person who filed the extensions. He stated he did not believe
he was going to owe taxes because in the past he had received refunds. After he was
notified  in  2017  that  he  owed  taxes,  he  contacted  his  accountant,  and  he  made
arrangements to file and pay his taxes. Applicant testified that he has not discussed their
tax issues regarding his security clearance with his wife prior to attending his hearing. He
has not discussed with her any actions she may have taken regarding their tax returns.
(Tr. 21-37; AE B, AE C)
The  SOR  alleged  other  delinquent  debts.  Applicant  testified  that  several
were paid and they became delinquent due to oversight and a mix up with mail because
his father has the same name. He did not have the documents to show which debts were
paid and he could not remember them. He said the only thing he could do is obtain a new
credit report to show the accounts were paid. He did not provide a credit report in his post-
hearing submissions. (Tr. 22-23, 55-57)
Applicant has approximately $90,000 of deferred student loans. He testified that
he  attended financial counseling through  a  program  offered  at  his church  in  2018  and
again  in  2020.  Credit  reports from  October 2019  and  July 2017  corroborate  the  debts
alleged. They reflect the debts began accumulating in 2019. (Tr. 22-23, 55-57; GE 3, GE
4)
Applicant  testified  that  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.g  ($250);  1.l  ($922);  1.m
($36); and 1.n ($70 were paid in full. The record was held open to allow him to provide
supporting documents. He did not. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 56-59)
Applicant testified that two or three months ago, he made an offer to make $300
payment towards the collection accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.h ($2.947) and 1.i ($5,804), but did
not follow up. These debts are not resolved. (Tr. 60-61)
The  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.j  ($712)  is  a  charged  off  account.  Applicant  testified  he
attempted to contact the creditor about six months ago, but was unsuccessful. This debt
is unresolved. Regarding the past due account in SOR ¶ 1.k ($141), Applicant  did not
provide evidence that he has resolved it. (Tr. 61-62)
Applicant  testified  that  he  has  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  from  his  military
service. He did not seek treatment until this year. He stated many aspects of his life are
impacted by it. It placed a strain on his marriage. At one point, he was contemplating a
divorce.  He  stated  that  he  had  a  tendency  to  not  deal  with  his finances.  He  stated  he
ignored his finances and hoped the issues would go away. (Tr. 63-70)
Applicant has no money in savings and about $200 to $300 in expendable savings
each month after paying his expenses. He said most of his money goes to eating out and
tithes. He chooses to give to charity before paying taxes. He tithes about $1,500 a month.
He chooses to give to his local church because that is where his heart is. Applicant took
full responsibility for his errors when dealing with his finances. He stated his issues were
due  to  immaturity  and  not following  up  and  dealing  with  the  problems.  He  intended  to
work out payment plans to bring his accounts into good standing. (Tr. 70-77)
Applicant and his wife’s adjusted gross income for 2019 was $161,535; for 2018
was $168,237; for 2017 was $171,419; for 2016 was $170,892; for 2015 was $202,502;
for 2014 was $174,739; 2013 was $163,228; and 2012 was $159,075. (Tr. 47-48; AE B
through AE I)
In a post-hearing statement, Applicant expressed his regrets and remorse for his
failure. He takes full responsibility for his situation and blames no one. He requested to
continue to serve his family and the soldiers. He is committed to making changes. (AE A)
