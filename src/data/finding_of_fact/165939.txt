In  Applicant’s SOR response, he  admitted  the  SOR allegations in ¶¶  1.a  through
1.d  with  explanations. (Tr. 13-14;  HE 3) Applicant’s admissions are accepted  as findings
of  fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant is a 47-year-old air conditioning technician, and a DOD contractor has
employed him since September 2018. (Tr. 6-7, 26) He worked as a building manager on
a base when he was a federal civilian employee  from about 2013 to 2015. (Tr. 7-8) In
1994,  Applicant  received  a  General  Educational  Development  diploma.  (Tr.  6)  He
completed an air conditioning technical school. (Tr. 6) In 1995, he married, and his two
children are ages 25 and 26. (Tr. 7-8) He has never served in the military. (Tr. 8) He has

Financial Considerations
In 2008, the economy declined, and Applicant’s income was reduced. (Tr. 37-38)
He lost his house and a car. (Tr. 22) He had two young children, and he decided to move
to  seek  employment.  (Tr.  22)  Instead  of  paying  his  federal  income  taxes,  he  used  his
savings to support his family. (Tr. 22) His income was reduced after he moved, and he
was underemployed. (Tr. 22, 38) When his daughter started college, Applicant had to file
his tax returns to enable her to apply for student loans and grants. (Tr. 22) Applicant and
his  spouse  set  up  a  payment  arrangement  with  the  IRS  in  which  he  was  supposed  to
make  $300  monthly payments.  (Tr.  23,  48) Around  2013  or  2014,  his  spouse  lost  her
employment  for about six months because she  was  having serious  medical  problems.
(Tr. 23, 39-40; AE B) After making payments for about six months, they defaulted on the
IRS payment arrangement due to a vehicle accident. (Tr. 23, 49; AE B) Applicant’s mother
moved into his home in lieu of a long-term care facility. (AE B) He expressed his concerns
about  the  IRS’s  establishment  of  payment  arrangements,  asserting  the  IRS  wanted
unreasonable amounts of monthly payments. (Tr. 23-24)
Applicant’s current annual gross pay is about $62,000, which is double his pay in
2008. (Tr. 23, 27) His and his spouse’s adjusted gross income (AGI) in 2015 on his federal
income  tax  return  was  $51,300,  and  in  2016,  his  AGI  was  $55,500.  (GE  2  at  8,  10)
Applicant’s current annual net pay is about $45,000. (Tr. 27) His spouse’s annual net pay
is about $20,000. (Tr. 29) His children are financially independent of Applicant and his
spouse. (Tr. 30) His daughter is a registered nurse, and his son has enlisted in the Navy.
(Tr. 30) Applicant and his spouse lease a 2019 truck and purchased a 2020 Mustang. (Tr.
34-36) The monthly payments on the two vehicles total $1,480, and his monthly rent is
$1,050. (Tr. 33-37)
In  August  2021,  Applicant  paid  a  tax  attorney  $1,000  and  promised  to  pay  him
$500 monthly for the next four months. (Tr. 24, 30-31; AE A) His tax attorney did not give
him a prediction on when he would have a new payment plan with the IRS or when his
tax  returns  were  going  to  be  filed  for  TYs  2019  and  2020.  (Tr.  55-56)  Applicant  was
worried about losing his employment and defaulting on any payment arrangement that he
made with the IRS. (Tr. 31-32) He promised to correct his tax situation. (Tr. 25)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c allege that Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax
returns  for  TYs  2006  through  2013,  2017,  and  2018.  (HE  2)  He  did  not  timely  file  his
federal income tax returns for TYs 2006 through 2011 because he did not believe he had
sufficient funds to pay his taxes at the end of the year. (Tr. 38-39) In 2013 or 2014, the
IRS assisted him, and he successfully filed his tax returns for TYs 2006 through 2013.
(Tr. 40-41; GE 2 at 5) He timely filed his federal income tax returns for TYs 2014, 2015,
and 2016. (Tr. 40-42; GE 2 at 5) He said he filed his federal income tax return for TY 2017
in March 2018. In his July 13, 2019 response to DOHA interrogatories, he said he had
not filed his federal income tax returns for TYs 2017 and 2018. (GE 2 at 5) He was sure
that he filed his TY 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns. (Tr. 43-46) He did not have
documentation showing when his TY 2017 federal income tax return was filed. (Tr. 46)
He  believed  he  timely  filed  his  federal  income  tax  return  for  TY  2018.  (Tr.  46)  I  have
credited Applicant with timely filing his TY 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns, and
with mitigation of SOR ¶ 1.c.
Applicant has not filed  his state  and  federal income  tax  returns for TYs 2019  and
2020, and  he  intends for his tax  attorney  to  file  these  overdue  tax  returns.  (Tr. 40, 44, 51-
52)  He did not request any  filing  extensions for his federal income  tax  returns.  (Tr. 52) He
tried  several times to  telephone  the  IRS  for help  in 2020; however, he  was unable to  reach
anyone  that  could  help. (Tr. 53-54)  He  was unable to  predict when  his federal income  tax
returns for TYs  2019 and 2020  would be  filed. (Tr. 56)  His failure to  timely file his federal
income  tax  returns for TYs 2019  and  2020  is not alleged  in  the  SOR, and  this issue  will
not be considered, except for the application of mitigating conditions and under the whole-
person concept.
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  and  Applicant  admitted  he  has  a  federal  income  tax  debt  of
about $15,500 for TYs 2006 through 2016. (Tr. 47; SOR response; GE 2 at 5) He may
owe more federal income taxes for TYs 2017 and 2018. (Tr. 47) He had a payment plan
in 2013 with the IRS in which he paid $300 monthly for about six months; however, he
did not have documentation concerning that payment plan. (Tr. 48-49) The payment plan
was interrupted by a vehicle accident; however, Applicant did not provide details about
why the vehicle accident caused his IRS payment plan to end. (AE B) Funds were needed
for a down payment possibly for a new vehicle. (AE B) He is waiting for his tax attorney
to arrange a payment plan for his IRS debt. (Tr. 48)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleged and Applicant admitted he failed to timely file his state income
tax returns for TYs 2017 and 2018. (Tr. 50-51; SOR response) He did not know whether
he owed state taxes. (Tr. 56)
In his response to interrogatories, Applicant provided a chart showing his federal
income tax filings and amounts owed. (Tr. 58) He also provided IRS tax transcripts  for
TYs 2015 and 2016. (Tr. 58; GE 2 at 8-11) In the event of conflicts, Applicant said the
IRS tax transcripts were definitely correct. (Tr. 58-59) His chart showed he owed federal
income taxes ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 for each TY from 2006 to 2013 for a total of
$15,500. (GE 2 at 5) The IRS tax transcript for TY 2015 showed a tax debt of $1,070, and
his chart showed $1,000. (GE 2 at 5, 8) The IRS tax transcript for TY 2016 showed a tax
debt of $2,269, and his chart showed a tax debt of $1,500. (GE 2 at 5, 10)  He did not
provide any other IRS tax transcripts.
Applicant has not received financial counseling. (Tr. 56) He does not use a written
budget. (Tr. 56)
Applicant’s spouse described him as “a hard-working, honorable, and trustworthy”
person. (AE B) She indicated he received praise for his diligence from his employer. (Id.)
Applicant’s spouse and Applicant intend to pay their taxes. (Id.)
