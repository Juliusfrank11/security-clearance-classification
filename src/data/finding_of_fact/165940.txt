Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  47  years  old.  He  is  a  high  school  graduate  and  has  earned  some
college credits. He married in 2008. His wife had a child that he adopted, and they also
have  two  other  children.  Their  ages  are  26,  20  and  18.  Applicant  has  worked  for  his
current employer since 2018. (Tr. 15-18)
In 2015 Applicant had a motorcycle accident and was severely injured. He had two
surgeries on his back, and he was unable to work for about three years. His job involved
manual labor. He was working at the time and was later terminated. He was cleared to
resume work in late 2017 or early 2018. Applicant attributed his financial problems to his
accident and being unable to work. His wife was working during this time and continues
to work, but her income was insufficient to cover all of their family’s expenses. Applicant
also  acknowledged  that  he  had  some  debts  prior  to  his  accident  that  he  had  difficulty
paying. (Tr. 18-22, 34-36, 45-47)
Initially, Applicant attempted to contact some creditors to negotiate settlements or
repayment plans, but was unable to do so because they either demanded the full amount
be  paid  or  the  payment  plans  were  more  money  than  he  could  afford.  More  recently,
Applicant  has  contacted  some  creditors,  but  the  debts  had  been  sold  to  third-party
collection companies, and they wanted full payment of the debts. He has been unable to
make payments on any of his delinquent debts due to the amounts owed. (Tr. 22-23, 39-
42)
The  delinquent  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  are  corroborated  by  Applicant’s
admissions,  statements  to  a  government  investigator,  and  credit  reports  from  August
2019, February 2020, and May 2021. A review of the May 2021 credit report shows that
the accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.g and 1.k were resolved by dispute. (GE 1 through 6)
Applicant’s  son  attends  college  and  receives  a  scholarship  for  his  tuition,  but
Applicant  pays  for  his  room  and  board,  which  is  about  $5,000  a  semester.  His  older
daughter is independent, and his younger daughter lives at home. He and his son have
cars.  One  is  paid  for  and  the  other  is  financed.  His  wife  drives  a  car  that  is  leased.
Applicant also owes about $50,000 for student loans. These loans are in deferment, which
Applicant indicated expires sometime at the end of this year. He anticipated his payments
to be approximately $250 a month. (Tr. 23-26)
Applicant stated he intended to pay his delinquent debts, but at this time does not
have the resources. He would like to consolidate his debt when he is able. He estimated
his annual salary is about $27,000 and his wife’s is about $23,000. Over the three years
he  was  unable  to  work,  he  estimated  his  out-of-pocket  medical  expenses  were  about
$10,000. He lost his medical insurance when he lost his job after his accident. He used
credit  cards  to  help  pay  his  expenses  and  at  times  had  difficulty  paying  his  rent  and
providing for his family. His parents helped them out. Applicant currently lives paycheck
to paycheck. (Tr. 25, 29-35, 49-50)
Applicant stated that he used Credit Karma to dispute some of his delinquent debts
to have them removed from his credit report. He had questions about the amounts owed
and  believed  there  were  inaccuracies  on  his  credit  report.  He  did  not  provide  any
supporting documents. (Tr. 47-53)
