In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.f
through 1.o, 1.r, and 1.s. (Item 2) She denied the SOR allegations in 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.p,
and  1.q.  Applicant’s  admissions  are  accepted  as  findings  of  fact.  Additional  findings
follow.
Applicant  is  60  years  old,  and  she  has  been  employed  as  a  technical  support
specialist since December 2014. (Item 3 at 11) She was unemployed from March 2014,
to December 2014. (Id. at 12) From October 2010, to September 2012, she worked for a
federal contractor as an operations analyst. (Id. at 13) From November 2007, to October
2010, she worked for a federal contractor as a technical support specialist. (Id. at 14-15)
She was awarded a bachelor’s degree in 1985, and an associate’s degree in 2015. (Id.
at 10; Item 4 at 6) She has not served in the military. (Item 3 at 17) She has had the same
cohabitant since 2002. (Id. at 19) She has never married, and  she does  not have  any
children. (Id. at 19-20)
Financial Considerations
Applicant indicated  several reasons for her debts becoming  delinquent: (1) job  loss
for herself  and  her cohabitant  (unemployment); (2) decrease  in pay  (underemployment);
(3) her cohabitant’s illness; and (4) her mother’s  illness and death in  2018. (Item 3  at 30;
Item  4) The  SOR alleges she  failed to  timely  file her state and  federal income tax returns
for tax years 2014 through 2018 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b).
Applicant admitted that she failed to timely file her federal and state income tax
returns for tax years 2014 through 2018. (Item 2) In her October 23, 2018 SCA, she said
she did not file her federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2015, 2016, and
2017 because she was unable to pay fees to prepare her tax returns. (Item 3 at 31-32)
She planned to schedule an appointment to complete her federal and state income tax
returns. (Id.)
On January 7, 2020, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories. (Item 4)  Her
December  2019  IRS  account  transcript  for  tax  year  2014  shows  she  timely  filed  her
federal income tax return. (Id. at 19-20). She said she provided her federal and state tax
information to a tax professional for tax years 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. (Id. at 13, 15)
The SOR alleges Applicant has 17 delinquent debts totaling $105,927 as follows:
SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.d  allege  Applicant  owes  federal  and  state  income  taxes  of
$13,000 and $4,500, respectively. (Item 1) In her October 23, 2018 SCA, she said she
owed $13,000 to the federal government for income taxes starting in 2014. (Item 3 at 30)
She  said  that  she  started  a  $100  monthly  payment  plan,  and  “will  be  making
arrangements to resume payments.” (Id. at 31) She owed $4,500 in state income taxes
starting in 2014, and she planned to pay the debt when her house is sold. (Id. at 31, 33)
On  March  28,  2019,  an  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  investigator
interviewed Applicant, and she said she had not filed and/or paid her federal income taxes
for tax years 2014 through 2017. (Item 4 at 7) She planned to file her tax returns and pay
all of her taxes upon the sale of her house and the settlement of her mother’s estate. (Id.)
In January 2015, the state filed a $4,500 tax lien against her. (Id.)
On April 29, 2019, Applicant paid the IRS $16,000 resolving her federal income
tax debt for tax year 2014. (Item 4 at 19-20). On June 27, 2019, Applicant paid the state
tax lien, and the state tax authority withdrew the lien. (Id. at 23). She did not indicate the
source of the funds to pay these debts; however, the funds presumably came from the
sale of her house.
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a charged-off mortgage debt for $42,907. (Item 1) Applicant’s
June 1, 2021 credit report shows this debt was paid in April 2019. (Item 7 at 4)
SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j through 1.o, 1.r, and 1.s allege delinquent debts for the
following amounts: 1.f ($7,510); 1.g ($8,099); 1.h ($5,650); 1.j ($2,847); 1.k ($2,730); 1.l
($1,784); 1.m ($1,697); 1.n ($1,413); 1.o ($1,217), 1.r ($4,483), and 1.s ($3,532). (Item 1)
In her October 23, 2018 SCA, Applicant said she owed the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.f
($7,000),  the  financial  issue  began  in  January  2015,  and  monthly  withholdings  were
pending. (Item 3 at 34; Item 4 at 7) She said she owed the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.o ($1,200),
the  financial  issue  began  in  January  2015,  and  she  met  with  a  lawyer  to  discuss  her
options. (Item 3 at 36)
In her October 23, 2018 SCA, Applicant said she owed credit card debts for the
following amounts and the financial issue began in the dates indicated: $7,000 (January
2015);  $3,500  (January  2015);  and  $4,500  (December  2017).  (Item  3  at  37-40)  In  her
SCA, she listed the names of the credit card companies, and the SOR listed the names
of the current collection agents from her credit reports. Thus, some of these three debts
may be included in her SOR. Her intention for the three debts was to meet with a lawyer
to  discuss  her  options.  In  her  SCA,  she  also  disclosed  a  home  loan  for  $10,000  that
became delinquent in December 2017, and she intended to sell her home to resolve this
debt. (Id. at 38-39) The $10,000 home loan debt is not listed in her SOR.
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges a delinquent debt for $3,593. (Item 1) Applicant’s June 1, 2021
credit report shows the debt in SOR ¶ 1.i was paid in May 2017. (Item 7 at 5-6)
SOR ¶ 1.p alleges a delinquent debt for $838. (Item 1) Applicant’s June 1, 2021
credit report shows the debt in SOR ¶ 1.p was paid in March 2020. (Item 7 at 5)
SOR  ¶  1.q  alleges  a  delinquent  debt  for  $127.  (Item  1)  This  debt  is  shown  on
Applicant’s September 12, 2019 credit report, but not on her June 1, 2021 credit report.
(Item  6  at  3;  Item  7)  She  denied  responsibility  for  the  debt  in  SOR  1.q  in  her  SOR
response, and she is credited with mitigating the debt in SOR ¶ 1.q.
SOR ¶¶ 1.r and 1.s allege delinquent debts for 1.r ($4,483) and 1.s ($3,532), which
are owed to the same bank. (Item 1) In her October 23, 2018 SCA, Applicant said she
owed  the  creditor  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.r  and  1.s  $5,000,  the  financial  issue  began  in  January
2015, and she met with a lawyer to discuss her options. (Item 3 at 35-36)
Applicant’s June 1, 2021 credit report shows the following SOR debts as currently
delinquent: 1.f ($7,510); 1.i ($1,784); 1.k ($2,730); and 1.n ($1,413). (Item 7 at 2-4) Her
June 2, 2021  credit  report  does not list  some  of  her SOR  debts, and  this credit  report
does not indicate any of the other SOR debts are in a delinquent status.
In  sum,  Applicant  is  credited  with  mitigation  of  the  following  SOR  debts:  1.c
($13,000); 1.d ($4,500); 1.e ($42,907); 1.i ($3,593); 1.p ($838); and 1.q ($127). She did
not provide evidence that she filed her federal and state tax returns for tax years 2015
through  2018  or that  she  resolved  11 delinquent  debts  totaling $40,962  in SOR  ¶¶ 1.f
through 1.h, 1.j through 1.o, 1.r, and 1.s.
In  the  FORM,  Department  Counsel  described  Applicant’s  security-significant
behavior and  noted  the  absence of  mitigation. The FORM  informed  Applicant that  she
had  30  days  from  the  receipt  of  the  FORM  “in  which  to  submit  a  documentary
response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation,
as  appropriate.  .  .  .  If  Applicant  does  not  file  any  objections  or  submit  any  additional
information . . . [her] case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination
based solely” on the evidence set forth in this FORM. (FORM at 3-4 (emphasis added))
Applicant did not provide any response to the FORM.
