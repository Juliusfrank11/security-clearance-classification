Applicant  is  a  47-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  where  he  has
worked  since  January  2019.  He  has  a  General  Educational  Development  (GED)  high
school  equivalency  diploma  and  trade  certifications.  He  is  married  for  the  fourth  time
after his first three marriages ended in divorce in 2002, 2014, and 2019. His current wife
(fourth) was also his second wife. He has two children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 18-23, 31-32;
GE 1, 2)
The  SOR  alleges  28  delinquent  debts.  The  debts  consist  of  3  past-due  or
charged-off  auto  loans;  18  delinquent  medical  debts  totaling  about  $4,200;  and  7
miscellaneous delinquent debts. However, the two $2,073 debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c
and  1.x  are  duplicate  accounts.  The  6  non-duplicate  miscellaneous  delinquent  debts
total about $4,780. The debts are listed on a February 2017 credit report, a March 2019
credit report, or both credit reports.
Applicant attributed his financial problems to  his divorces and an injury at work.
He stated that he was working 60 to 80 hours a week when he was injured in 2015. He
did not recover fast enough for his employer, who told him that he could resign or they
would let him go. He resigned. When he was able to work again, it was at an hourly rate
that was half of what he was earning. He moved to another state in 2016 for a job as a
DOD civilian employee. He and his third wife lived with her parents. She kicked him out
of  the  house  in  2017.  He  left  the  government  job  in  2018  and  relocated  to  his  current
location, which was essentially his home.  (Tr. at 16-17, 22-25;  Applicant’s response  to
the SOR; GE 1, 2)
In  addition  to  the  three  defaulted  auto  loans  alleged  in  the  SOR,  Applicant’s
credit report from February 2017 lists nine paid auto loans taken out between 2009 and
2014. The high  credit on  the  loans  was  reported  as  ranging from  $20,632  to  $54,619.
One of the loans was a joint account; the rest were individual accounts. It is unclear how
many of the loans were for purchased vehicles and how many were refinanced loans on
vehicles  already  owned.  The  credit  report  also  lists  a  current  joint  auto  loan  that  was
taken  out  in  2016  for  about  $23,703.  That  auto  loan  is  reported  on  the  March  2019
credit report as paid in 2018. That credit report lists two additional auto loans: a $10,840
individual auto loan that was opened in 2017, and was $656 past due; and a $15,421
individual  auto  loan  that  was  opened  in  2019.  That  loan  was  current.  Applicant  stated
that  the  $10,840  loan  was  for  a  motorcycle.  He  stated  that  he  became  current  on  the
loan, and then sold the motorcycle to his brother, who paid off the loan.1  (Tr. at 45-46;
GE 3, 4)
The auto loans alleged in the SOR will be addressed in the order they were taken
out.  SOR  ¶  1.y  alleges  a  $985  balance  due  on  a  loan  for  a  vehicle  that  had  been
repossessed.  The  2017  credit  report  lists  it  as  a  voluntary  surrender  on  an  individual
1  None of the auto loans in this paragraph were alleged in the SOR, and only one of them was reported
as past due. They are addressed in the decision solely to place the debts that were alleged in the SOR in
context.
loan  of  about  $32,000  that  was  opened  in  2011,  with  a  date  of  last  action  of  October
2014. Applicant stated that the vehicle was awarded to his at-the-time second wife (now
current  wife)  in  their  divorce,  but  she  did  not  maintain  the  payments,  and  it  was
repossessed. There is no evidence of any payments made toward the deficiency. (Tr. at
26-28; Applicant’s response to the SOR; GE 3, 4).
Applicant and  his third  wife  borrowed  about $55,000  on  an  auto  loan  in 2014. He
stated   that  the   vehicle   was  repossessed   in  about  2016   after  he   lost  his  job   due   to   an
injury.  The   deficiency   balance   due   on   the   loan   is  about  $25,000   (SOR  ¶  1.b).  Neither
Applicant nor his third  wife  have  made  any  payments toward the  deficiency.  (Tr. at 26-
28
Applicant  and  his  third  wife  borrowed  about  $30,000  on  an  auto  loan  in  2018.
The March 2019 credit report lists the loan as a joint account that was $2,202 past due,
with  a  balance of  $33,364  (SOR  ¶ 1.a).  He  stated  that  the  vehicle  was  his third  wife’s
car. He did not think that his 2002 car would make the trip when he relocated to another
state in 2018. She let him use the car for the trip, but it  was apparently returned to his
third  wife.  The  current  status  of  the  car  and  the  loan  is  uncertain.  (Tr.  at  28-33;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 4)
Applicant  stated   that  many   of  the   medical  debts   were  for   his   third   wife   and   his
third  wife’s   children. They   were Applicant’s stepchildren  at the   time. Since  the   divorce,
the  children  are  no  longer related  to  Applicant. He  stated  that  some of  the medical  debts
were related  to  his  2015  work-related  injury. (Tr. at  37-38; Applicant’s response  to  SOR;
GE 2-4)
Applicant contracted with a credit-repair company in 2019 or early 2020 to assist
him  in  disputing  items  on  his  credit  report.  He  stated  that  the  company  also  provided
counseling on how to resolve his financial problems. They recommended, and he stated
that  he  is  following,  the  “snowball”  method  of  paying  the  smallest  debts  first  and  then
moving  on  to  the  next  largest  debt.  He  stated  that  he  is  paying  or  paid  several  of  the
debts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  He  was  informed  of  the  importance  of  providing
documentation,  but  he  failed  to  provide  any  documented  proof  of  payments,  either
during the hearing or post-hearing. (Tr. at 16, 27, 33-43; AE A, E, F)
Applicant stated that his wife is attempting to find a better job, and he is looking
for a part-time job. He stated that he and his wife both have vehicles, and they each pay
the  loan  on  their  vehicle.  After  the  hearing,  Applicant  submitted  a  “consumer-debt-to-
income worksheet.” It shows that he is paying $870 per month on a loan for a truck, with
a balance of $34,556; and $246 per month on a loan for a motorcycle, with a balance of
$4,671. He stated that he was unable to obtain documentation of payments toward any
of the SOR debts. (Tr.at 17, 43; AE E, G)
Applicant  submitted  documents  and  letters  attesting  to  his  excellent  job
performance  and  strong  moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his  trustworthiness,  work
ethic, generosity, honesty, professionalism, and integrity. (AE B-D)
