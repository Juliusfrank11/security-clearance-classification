In  Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted  the  SOR allegations  in ¶¶  1.a  through
1.k.   (HE   3)   He   also   provided   mitigating   information.  His   admissions   are   accepted   as
findings of  fact.
Applicant  is  31  years  old,  and  he  has  been  a  field  service  engineer  for  a  DOD
contractor since March of 2020. (Tr. 6-8, 18, 20) He served in Iraq, Afghanistan, Jordan,
Kuwait, and Dubai. (Tr. 54) He served in Iraq from August 2018 to March 2019, and from
October 2019 to March 2020. (AE M) From March 2019 to October 2019, he served in
Kuwait. (Id.) From March 2020 to present, he served in Jordan. (Id.) He recently changed
his career to network engineer. (Tr. 56)
In  2008, Applicant  graduated  from high school. (Tr. 6) In  2013, he  was awarded a
bachelor’s degree  with  a  major in criminal justice and with  a  minor in sociology. (Tr. 7, 19)
He has about 12  credit  hours of  post  graduate  education. (Tr. 7) He  was awarded  three
professional certifications. (Tr. 19; AE  N) He served  in the  Air  Force  from  2008  to  2014;
he  was an  E-4  when  he  was discharged;  and  he  received  an  honorable discharge. (Tr. 7-
8, 23; AE  K) His Air  Force  specialty  was security  forces.  (Tr. 7)  He  married  in  2016, and
he  was divorced  in 2017. (Tr. 8, 19) His former spouse  has custody  of  their five-year-old
son, and  he  is current on  his child  support. (Tr. 9, 19)  He pays about $1,500  monthly  to
support his son. (Tr. 43).
Financial Considerations
In 2015, Applicant had more expenses due to the birth of his son, and his annual
income  was  about  $32,000.  (Tr.  46;  GE  2  at  7)  He  allowed  some  debts  to  become
delinquent in order to ensure his son was receiving adequate financial support. (Tr. 47)
He moved to a different city to be near his son, and it was important to him to ensure his
son and his son’s mother had a place to live. (Tr. 26) Applicant had insufficient income to
support two households. (Tr. 40) In 2018, he obtained employment with a higher salary,
and he employed a credit-repair company (CRC1) to help him with his credit because he
wanted to purchase a home; however, that CRC1 was ineffective. (Tr. 49; GE 2 at 7)
In   July   2019,   Applicant  employed   a   different  credit-repair   company   (CRC2)  to
handle his delinquent debts.  (Tr. 30; SOR response) He made  an  initial payment of $1,500
to  CRC2. (Tr.  50) CRC2  was supposed  to  resolve  his debts  over a  three-year period. (Tr.
50) He gradually  saved  the funds over about  one  year to  have  sufficient funds for CRC2
to   settle  his  debts   with   single  large   payments.  (Tr.  51;  AE   A;  AE   B)  CRC2   had   direct
contact  with   Applicant’s  creditors.  (Tr.  30)   He  said  he   received   financial  counseling   in
2017  or 2018  from  a  friend.  (Tr. 42)  He  used  a  chart on  CRC2’s website  to  determine  the
amount of  money he could use to resolve his debts. (Tr. 42)
Applicant’s current monthly income is about $12,000. (Tr. 20, 42; AE L) He puts
$600 monthly into a 401(k) account. His income was reduced because of the COVID-19
pandemic. (Tr. 50) He has about $7,000 in his savings account. (Tr. 51) His student loans
are in deferment because of  the COVID-19 pandemic federal relief. (Tr. 45) When the
student-loan deferment ends, he plans to keep his student-loan current using automatic
payments from his bank. (Tr. 45)
On June 11, 2019, an Office of Personnel Management investigator interviewed
Applicant. (GE 2) Applicant indicated he was providing about $2,300 to support his former
spouse and son. (Id. at 2) In 2018, he had about 28 delinquent accounts on his credit
report and the total at that time was about $100,000. (Id. at 3-7) In 2018, and the first half
of 2019, he worked diligently and brought most of the debts to current status, including
10 student loans totaling about $65,000. (Id. at 4)
The SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling $44,533 as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant has a charged-off vehicle loan for $15,239. He
purchased  a  vehicle;  however,  he  returned  the  vehicle  to  the  dealer  after  a  week  for
repairs. (Tr. 48) The dealer had the vehicle for a long time and was unable to make the
repairs. (Tr. 48) He opened the account around February 2016, and it became delinquent
around September 2019. (Tr. 24) He made a complaint about the dealer to a state entity.

Applicant  cosigned  on  a  vehicle  loan  with  his  spouse,  and  she  failed  to  make  the
payments.  (Tr.  47-48)  She  decided  to  get  a  different  vehicle,  and  the  vehicle  was
repossessed. (Tr. 49) On August 27, 2021, CRC2 wrote advising Applicant that on July
1, 2021, the account was removed from his credit report due to  collection being barred
by the statute of limitations. (Tr. 28-29; AE I)
SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  that  Applicant  has  a  past-due  telecommunications  debt  for
$1,157. On March 24, 2020, the creditor wrote the last payment was received on March
17, 2020, and the debt was resolved. (Tr. 30-31; SOR response at 38; AE G)
SOR ¶  1.e alleges that  Applicant has a charged-off debt for $409. In 2017, this
credit-card debt became delinquent. (Tr. 32) Applicant received magazine subscriptions
from a company, and he did not believe he should pay for them. (Tr. 33) CRC2 handled
the resolution of the debt. (Tr. 33) He believed the debt was settled; however, he did not
have a receipt showing the debt was resolved. (Tr. 34) The debt does not appear on his
August 24, 2021 Equifax credit report. (AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges that Applicant has a collection debt for $385. On March 24, 2020,

than the full balance.” (Tr. 35; SOR response at 10; AE E)
SOR  ¶  1.g  alleges  that  Applicant  has  a  collection  debt  owed  to  the  Defense
Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) for $560. On April 1, 2020, DFAS wrote that the
debt  was  due  to  an  overpayment  in  2019,  and  the  debt  was  paid.  (Tr.  35-36;  SOR
response at 4)
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges that Applicant has a collection debt for $1,541. Applicant asked
a relative to return telecommunications equipment for him after he was deployed. (Tr. 37)
He believed CRC2 was handling resolution of this debt. (Tr. 37) This debt is not listed on
his August 24, 2021 Equifax credit report. (AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges that Applicant has a collection debt for $698. On March 17, 2020,

7; AE F)
SOR  ¶  1.j  alleges  that  Applicant  has  a  collection  debt  for  $580.  Applicant  was
unsure about resolution of this telecommunications debt, and he suggested it may have
originated from not returning equipment when he moved to a different state. (Tr. 38-39)
He  believed  he  submitted  it  for  CRC2’s  resolution,  and  that  CRC2  had  arranged  a
settlement  on the debt.  (Tr. 39) This debt  is not  listed  on  Applicant’s  August  24, 2021
Equifax credit report. (AE C)
SOR  ¶  1.k  alleges  that  Applicant  has  a  collection  debt  for  $438.  On  March  11,
2020, the creditor wrote that the account had a zero balance. (Tr. 40-41; SOR response
at 23)
Applicant’s August 24, 2021 Equifax credit report indicates no collection accounts.
(AE C at 3) This credit report includes the following negative information: the charged-off
debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b;  three  past-due  non-SOR  education  loans  that  were
transferred  in  2015;  and  a  paid  charged-off  non-SOR  credit  union  debt  with  a  zero
balance. (AE C at 72-90) The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b were settled too recently to
have this resolution reflected on his August 24, 2021 Equifax credit report.
On  August  16,  2018,  Applicant  settled  a  debt  in  collections  for  an  unspecified
