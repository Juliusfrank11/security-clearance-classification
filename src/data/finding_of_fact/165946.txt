Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  59  years  old,  has  been  married  for  34  years,  and  has  two  adult
children. In 1984, he began working for a defense contractor as an engineer. He retired
from that company after about 35 years. He then began working for a second defense
contractor in 2019. He has continuously held a security clearance since 1984. He earned
a bachelor’s degree in 1984 and a master’s degree  in business administration in 2000.
He also earned a certificate in project management in 2005.  (Tr. at 36-40.)
Applicant disclosed in his 2014 SCA that he had not filed his tax year (TY) 2011
state tax return and that the state tax authority had issued a garnishment of his wages in
the amount of $5,900. He noted that he intended to file the return in April 2014, which
would result in the state releasing the garnishment. This disclosure and incident reports
filed by Applicant’s employer regarding  his state wage garnishments triggered a review
by the Government of Applicant’s tax filings and payments for the TYs 2009 through 2018.
(Tr. at 42-44; GE 1 at 32-33; GE 4 at 9-12, 13-15, 16-26.)
The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his Federal and state tax returns for
TYs 2009 through 2019 in a timely manner, as required. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b.) The SOR
also alleges that the state imposed tax liens on Applicant in 2009 for unpaid taxes in 2006
and 2007; and again in 2013, 2017, and 2018 for unpaid taxes in TYs 2011, 2014, and
an  unspecified  year,  respectively.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c  through  1.g.)  In  his  Answer,  Applicant
admitted all of these allegations except 1.g. The SOR sets forth two additional allegations.
One is for a debt in collection in an amount of about $9,759. (SOR ¶ 1.h) The other is an
allegation that he filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in 1998 seeking to discharge about
$196,258  in  liabilities.  (SOR  ¶  1.i)  Applicant  denied  these  last  two  allegations  in  his
Answer. The specific facts regarding each of the allegations are as follows:
SOR Allegations
Paragraph  1,  Guideline  F  - The  SOR  sets  forth  eight  allegations  under  this
concern. In his Answer, Applicant admitted each of the allegations. The details regarding
each of these allegations are as follows:
1.a   Failure   to   timely   file   Federal   income   taxes   returns   for  TYs   2009-2019   –
Applicant did not file his Federal income tax returns on time for TYs 2009 through 2019,
as  evidenced  by  the  IRS  transcripts  in  the  record  for  TYs  2009  through  2018,  and
Applicant’s registered mail receipt for his TY 2019 Federal return, which Applicant added
to the record after the hearing as AE II. Applicant represented in his January 16, 2020
interrogatory  responses  that  his  2019  Federal  tax  return  would  be  filed  “before  April
2020.” His mail receipt reflects a mailing date for this return of May 17, 2021. Even after
submitting  his  2014  SCA,  Applicant  continued  to  file  his  Federal and  state  tax  returns
after their due dates. Applicant maintained at the hearing that although he did not file his
Federal income tax returns in a timely manner for each of these years, he never owed
any  taxes.  He  provided  no  IRS  documents,  however,  confirming  that  assertion  for  the
years  2016  through  2019,  even  though  he  said  he  would  after  the  hearing.  He
acknowledged receiving letters from the IRS over the years at issue regarding his failure
to file his tax returns as required. After receiving the SOR in November 2020, Applicant
filed his TY 2020 Federal tax return on time. (Tr. at 42-44, 46-64, 69-79, 81-84, 91, 116;
GE 4 at 9-12, 13-15, 16-27; AE E-N, AE II; AE JJ.)
Applicant further testified that he received substantial refunds for each of the tax
years in question because he deliberately overwithheld on his taxes. The record reflects
that though he filed his returns three years after their due dates during the years involved,
he managed to file his returns in time to avoid losing his tax refunds under the Federal
statutory limitation for claiming income tax refunds. He testified that this timing was his
“MO,”  or  modus  operandi.  (Tr.  at  62.)  Applicant  testified  that  he  filed  three  years  late
rather than on time because each year, it was not his “priority” to file timely even though
he was delaying the receipt of his refund by three years. When he was about to be too
late to claim his refund, then the filing became a priority. Also, when he filed his returns
and  the  IRS  determined  that  he  owed  no  additional  taxes,  the  IRS  would  reverse  the
interest and penalties it had imposed if it prepared a substitute return. (Tr. at 52-56, 67.)
1.b Failure  to  timely  file  state  income  tax  returns  for TYs  2009-2019  – During
the 11 tax years in question, Applicant also filed his state income tax returns in an untimely
manner. He filed  his state  tax  returns at the  same  time  as his Federal returns.  All  of  his
returns during  that  period  were filed  late  by  about  one  or more  years, typically  three  years
late.  At  the  hearing, he  submitted  a  document  from  his state  tax  authority  indicating  that
his 2019  return  was filed  on  May  17, 2021, about one  year late.  The  same  exhibit reflects
that he  timely  filed  his 2020  tax  return in 2021, when  the  filing  date was delayed  to  June
15, 2021,  due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Applicant further  testified that he only owed his
state  any  additional  tax  in one  year,  TY  or 2016  or  2017.   He owed  $493  more  than  the
taxes withheld from his  paychecks. He received  refunds  in the  other years. (Tr. at 45,  79-
89; AE E; AE DD; AE  HH; AE KK.)
1.c  2009  state tax  levy  in the  amount  of  about  $4,883  for TY  2006  – Applicant’s
state tax issues date back to TYs 2006 and 2007 when the state imposed liens for both
tax years. In certain years when Applicant failed to file his tax returns on time, the state
would calculate his taxes without regard to his personal tax deductions, determine that
he owed additional taxes, and impose a tax lien. Applicant explained that the state would
withdraw the liens once he eventually filed his tax returns and the returns demonstrated
that he was owed a refund. Applicant provided a screenshot of a webpage of the state
tax authority summarizing his tax account.  The document reflects that he owes no taxes
for any of  the  tax years from 2010 to 2018. A  similar document shows  no  taxes  owed
during the period TYs 2011 through 2020. (Tr. at  81-82; GE 2 at 1-2; GE 4 at 30; AE A.)
1.d 2009  state tax  levy  in the  amount  of  about  $6,967  for TY  2007  – See 1.c,
above.
1.e  2013  state tax  levy  in the  amount  of  about  $5,997  for TY  2013  –  See 1.c,
above.
1.f 2017  state tax levy  in the  amount  of about  $11,296  for  TY  2014  –   See 1.c,
above.
1.g 2018  state tax levy in the amount of about $6,982  – See  1.c,  above.
1.h Delinquent  debt  in collection in  the  amount  of  about  $9,759  –  This debt
arose from Applicant’s use of a credit card to pay expenses related to his father’s care in
his old age and the management of his home before and after his father’s death. Applicant
was unable to pay the account, and it became delinquent. He testified that this debt arose
at a time when he had children in college and had other expenses. He settled the debt in
November 2017 with a lump-sum payment of $7,000. (Tr. at 92-98; GE 6 at 8; AE Z.)
1.i   1998   Chapter  7   bankruptcy   petition   with  debts   of   about   $196,258   –
Applicant testified that he became indebted at the time and could not pay his bills. The
main reason for his financial distress at the time was that he became responsible for child
support  for a  child  he  had  fathered  in  1980.  He  first  learned  about  the  child  when  the
child’s mother applied for welfare. He was notified that he had to provide child support of
about $500 per month. That financial obligation continued for about five years. He had
two young children with his wife. His work was the family’s only source of income. This
unexpected expense ultimately caused him to seek a discharge of his consumer debts in
a total amount of  about $80,000 or $90,000. He fully paid his child support obligations
until the child reached the age of 18. (Tr. at 98-101; GE 5 at 25.)
Whole-Person Evidence
Applicant  submitted  evidence  regarding  the  strength  of  his  current  financial
position. He has a high credit score, high six-figure retirement accounts, and significant
cash  reserves.  He  also  has  substantial  equity  in  his  residence  and  three  investment
properties.  (Answer at 2; AE B-D; AE BB; AE CC.)
Applicant  also  submitted  his  two  most  recent  employee  performance  reviews,
which rate him as an excellent employee with significant technical knowledge. His many
years of experience in his industry has made him a valuable employee. He also provided
evidence of his contributions to his local high school and as a mentor. (AE EE; AE FF;
AE GG; AE LL.)
