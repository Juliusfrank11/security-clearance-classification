Applicant  is  a  59-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance.  She  has  a  job  as  an  administrative  assistant  with  a  major  company  in  the
defense industry. She has been so employed since 2016. Her educational background
includes a certificate awarded in 2002 after attending a for-profit college (since closed)
during  2001-2002,  and  a  certificate  awarded  in  2014  upon  completion  of  a  six-month
program  at  a  community  college.  She  has  been  married  and  divorced  twice.  She  has
three adult children. She has no military service.
1  An applicant’s answer must be received by the DOHA within 20 days of receipt of the SOR, and if not,
processing of the case may be discontinued. Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶¶ E3.1.4 and E3.1.5.
2  The  SOR  “shall  be  as  detailed  and  comprehensive  as  the  national  security  permits.”  Directive,
Enclosure  3,  ¶¶  E3.1.3.  Despite  this  well-established  rule,  the  SOR  here  simply  stated  a  total  sum,
$15,051,  owed  in  back  taxes  to  the  IRS  for  five  tax  years.  The  SOR  did  not  state  in  a  detailed  and
comprehensive  way  the  amount  owed  per  tax  year.  Department  Counsel  did  not  explain  how  the  total
sum  was arrived at,  stating  simply  that “[p]er the  SOR, [Applicant]  amassed  over  $15,000  in tax  debts.”
Brief at 2. As a result of this ambiguity or inexactness, it was left to me to deduce the amounts owed for
the individual tax years, and my math skills are less than stellar, to say the least.
The  SOR  concerns  a  history  of  income-tax  problems  consisting  of  Applicant’s
failure to timely file a federal income tax return for tax year 2013, and back taxes owed
to  the  IRS  for  five  tax  years.  As  I  understand  and  construe  her  answer  to  the  SOR,
Applicant  does  not  dispute  or  contest  the  central  point  of  the  SOR  allegations,  but
instead contends her tax situation is less serious than alleged.
Applicant  disclosed  her  income-tax  problems  when  she  completed  her  2017
security  clearance  application.  (Exhibit  2  at  Section  26)  She  provided  additional
information  about  her  income-tax  problems  during  her  2019  background  investigation
and  in  response  to  written  interrogatories  in  2020.  (Exhibits  3  and  4)  Of  note,  her
response  to  the  interrogatories  included  supporting  documentation,  such  as  IRS
Account Transcripts for multiple tax years. I will rely on the transcripts because I have
found them to be easy to understand, reliable, and the best evidence.
In  addition  to  the  IRS  Account  Transcripts,  Applicant  presented  information
showing  she  had  filed  state  income  tax  returns  and  paid  taxes  due  in  her  states  of
residence. (Exhibits 3 and 4)
Applicant’s  financial  history  includes  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  case  in  2014.
(Exhibit 5) The Schedule E in the bankruptcy records reflects she then owed $8,866 in
back taxes to the IRS for tax year 2011, and $2,891 for tax year 2012.
For  tax  year  2007,  the  IRS  Account  Transcript,  as  of  January  2020,  showed
Applicant filing as head of household; an account balance of $0; and taxable income of
$21,375. (Exhibit 3)
For  tax  year  2009,  the  IRS  Account  Transcript,  as  of  January  2020,  showed
Applicant filing as head of household; an account balance of $0; and taxable income of
$58,249. (Exhibit 3)
For  tax  year  2011,  the  IRS  Account  Transcript,  as  of  February  2020,  showed
Applicant  filing  as  head  of  household;  an  account  balance  of  $8,072;  and  taxable
income of $50,299. (Exhibit 4)
For tax year 2013, the IRS Account Transcript, showed Applicant filing as head
of  household;  an  account  balance  of  -$200;  and  the  income  information  was  not
reported because the tax return had not been filed. (Exhibits 3 and 4)  As stated in her
answer  to  the  SOR,  she  explained  that  she  believed  she  had  timely  filed  her  federal
income  tax  return  for  2103,  but  it  was  not  because  of  an  error  made  by  the  firm  she
hired  to  prepare  her  income  tax  returns.  She  stated  that  she  discovered  the  error  in
about 2019, and she filed the return in about October 2020.
For  tax  year  2014,  the  IRS  Account  Transcript,  as  of  February  2020,  showed
Applicant filing as head of household; an account balance of $0; and taxable income of
$25,643. (Exhibit 4)
For  tax  year  2015,  the  IRS  Account  Transcript,  as  of  February  2020,  showed
Applicant filing as single; an account balance of $1,547; and taxable income of $29,195.
(Exhibit 4)
For  tax  year  2016,  the  IRS  Account  Transcript,  as  of  January  2020,  showed
Applicant filing as single; an account balance of $559; and taxable income of $36,225.
(Exhibit 3)
For  tax  year  2017,  the  IRS  Account  Transcript,  as  of  January  2020,  showed
Applicant filing as single; an account balance of $567; and taxable income of $42,698.
(Exhibit 3)
For  tax  year  2018,  the  IRS  Account  Transcript,  as  of  January  2020,  showed
Applicant  filing  as  single;  an  account  balance  of  $0;  and  taxable  income  of  $38,922.
(Exhibit 3)
In  summary,  the  IRS  Account  Transcripts  show  Applicant  owes  approximately
$10,745, plus any additional penalty and interest, for the  four tax years of 2011, 2015,
2016, and 2017. Including the $2,891 in back taxes for 2012, which are reflected in the
bankruptcy records, the total is approximately $13,636 for the five tax years in question.
Per the IRS Account Statement for 2011, the IRS determined the balance due on
Applicant’s account was currently not collectible in October 2019. (Exhibits 3 and 4). As
I  understand  IRS  practice  and  procedure,  a  currently  not  collectible  status  protects  a
taxpayer  from  the  IRS,  stopping  levies,  threatening  letters,  and  collection.  It’s  like
“putting  a  debt  on  the  shelve”  because  the  IRS  takes  the  case  out  of  their  active
collection  inventory  (shelving  it);  it  is  not  a  forgiveness  or  cancellation  of  debt.  In
addition,  the  IRS  is  free  to  return  a  case  to  their  active  collection  inventory  if  the
taxpayer’s situation changes.
Applicant  stated  in  her answer  to  the  SOR  that  she  has  made  payments  to  the
IRS, corresponded with the IRS, and even submitted a payment plan form to which she
had not received a reply from the IRS. A review of the IRS Account Transcripts shows
that  she  has  made  sporadic  or  irregular  payments  over  the  years,  her  most  recent
payment was made in October 2018, that she had  installment agreements established
but they did not last, and that she received penalties for dishonored payments. To date,
she does not have an installment agreement established or pending with the IRS so far
as I can determine.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.3  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”4  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.5  The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.6
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.7  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.8
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to
protect classified or sensitive information. . ..
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,

‘right’  to a security  clearance”); Duane v. Department  of Defense, 275 F.3d  988,  994 (10th  Cir. 2002)  (no

unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;
AG ¶  19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local
income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income
tax as required; and
AG ¶  20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax
authority  to  file  or  pay  the  amount  owed  and  is  in  compliance  with  those
arrangements.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.  The
disqualifying conditions noted above apply here.
Applicant is now in partial compliance with the IRS, which means that she filed all
tax returns, as required. Her proof of filing for tax year 2013 is not documented here, but
I am nonetheless persuaded that  she filed the 2013 federal income tax return in about
October  2020,  as  stated  in  her  answer  to  the  SOR.  I  was  also  persuaded  by  her
explanation that the untimely filing was the result of an error made by the tax accounting
firm.  Her explanation was  reasonable  given  that  she otherwise  timely filed  tax returns.
On this basis, the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a is decided for Applicant.
Concerning  her  indebtedness  to  the  IRS,  Applicant  owes  more  than  $13,000  in
back  taxes,  interest,  and  penalties  to  the  IRS.  She  presented  no  documentation
showing  that  she  is  working  to  establish  an  arrangement  with  the  IRS  to  resolve  the
indebtedness.  It  is further  noted  that  her  past  efforts  with  installment  agreements  with
the IRS were unsuccessful. Although her account with the IRS has been in a currently
not  collectible status  since  late 2019, that  status does  not prevent or prohibit her from
paying  what  she  owes.  And  it  does  not  mean  her  years  of  nonpayment  of  back  taxes
cannot be considered here.
In  addressing  this issue, I note  that an  applicant’s failure to  timely  file tax  returns
and  pay tax  when due  bears close  examination and is a matter of serious concern to the
federal  government.  The  DOHA  Appeal Board has made  it clear that  an  applicant who
fails repeatedly  to  fulfill their  legal obligations, such  as  filing  tax  returns and  paying  tax
when   due,  does   not  demonstrate   the   high   degree   of  good   judgment  and   reliability
required   of   those   granted   access  to   classified   information.  See   ISCR   Case   No.   15-
06707 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2017).
To her credit, Applicant disclosed her income-tax problems in her 2017 security
clearance  application,  and  she  provided  additional  information  during  the  security
clearance process. But her remedial efforts fall short of the mark. This is shown by her
sporadic or irregular payment history, and her last payment to the IRS about three years
ago in October 2018. Furthermore, she has not yet made a payment arrangement with
the IRS. It is also too soon to tell if she will succeed in making a payment arrangement
with  the  IRS  and  then  comply  with  that  arrangement.  The  evidence  as  a  whole  is  not
sufficient  to  justify  complete  mitigation  of  her  long-standing  history  of  income-tax
problems. On this basis, the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b is decided against Applicant.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent standard, I have  doubts and  concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good   judgment,  and   ability   to   protect
classified   or  sensitive   information.   In   reaching   this  conclusion,  I  weighed   the   evidence
as  a   whole  and   considered   if   the   favorable  evidence   outweighed   the   unfavorable
evidence  or vice  versa. I also  considered  the  whole-person  concept.  I conclude  that she
has not  met  her  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  show  that  it  is clearly  consistent  with
the  national interest  to  grant her eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph  1, Guideline  F:
Against Applicant
Subparagraph  1.a:
For Applicant
Subparagraph  1.b:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for
access to classified information. National security eligibility is denied.
