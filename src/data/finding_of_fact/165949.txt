Under Guideline F, the  Government alleged that Applicant owes $51,870 for 13
delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a –  1.m), ten of  which (SOR 1.a  –  1.j) consist of
delinquent student loans totaling $48,866, or about 94 percent of the total debt at issue.
In response, Applicant admitted with explanations all of the Guideline F allegations.
Under Guideline  E, the  Government  alleged that  Applicant  deliberately withheld
from Section 26 (Financial Record) of his e-QIP all of the adverse financial information
alleged in SOR 1.a –  1.m. In response, Applicant denied that he intentionally provided
false  information  or  intentionally  withheld  any  information.  In  addition  to  the  facts
established by Applicant’s admissions to SOR 1.a – 1.m, I make the following findings of
fact.
Applicant is 43 years old. He and his wife have been married since 2002 and have
two children, one of whom still lives with them. Applicant served in the Marine Corps as
a field radio operator between 1997 and 2001, when he was honorably discharged. (GX
1; Tr. 6)
After working in jobs unrelated to the defense industry between 2001 and 2006,
Applicant  began  working  for  a  series  of  defense  contractors  in  positions  related  to  his
Marine Corps training. He first received a security clearance for his military duties in 1997.
In 2008, his clearance was renewed for work with a defense contractor where he worked
between 2007 and 2010. Since October 2020, he has worked for a defense contractor as
a communications technician; however, his current request for clearance was sponsored
by a previous employer for whom he worked between April 2015 and October 2020. (GX
1; Tr. 59)
On  three  occasions,  Applicant  has  been  laid  off  when  his  employers  lost  the
contracts to which he was assigned. He was unemployed for two months in 2007, for one
month  in  2010,  and  between  October  2014  and  March  2015.  He  has  been  steadily
employed since March 2015. Applicant and his wife have lived in the same home since
March  2013,  and  they  have  a  combined  annual  income  of  about  $99,000.  Applicant
estimates  that  they  have  about  $500  remaining  each  month  after expenses;  however,
other  than  an  employer-sponsored  retirement  account  with  a  balance  of  less  than
$10,000,  they  have  no  savings.  By  his  own  admission,  Applicant  is  not  very  good  at
managing his money. (GX 1; Tr. 47, 53 – 54)
Applicant attended a technical school between 2004 and 2006, when he earned
an  associate’s  degree.  Between  2012  and  2014,  he  returned  to  school  and  earned  a
bachelor’s degree.  Applicant obtained  a  series of federally  subsidized  student loans  to
fund his studies. At hearing, he testified that he made the required monthly payments on
those loans until about 2015 around the time of his most recent period of unemployment.
Applicant has not made any payments on his student loans in the past six years. When
asked why he did not resume his loan payments when he regained employment, he stated
that he forgot about them despite receiving notices from the creditors holding those loans.
Eventually, the federal government began diverting Applicant’s income tax refunds each
year and Applicant considered those diversions as his “payment for the year.” (GX 1; Tr.
45, 50, 61 – 62)
The  credit  reports  presented  by  Department  Counsel  document  all  of  the
delinquent debts addressed in the SOR. All of them were more than 120 days past due,
in  a  collection  status,  or  otherwise  delinquent  when  Applicant  completed  his  e-QIP  in
October 2017;  however, Applicant did  not list  any of  those debts or otherwise  indicate
that he had any financial problems at that time. In October 2016, he was interviewed by
a  government  investigator  about  his  finances.  After  initially  denying  that  he  had  any
accounts that were in collection or more than 120 days past due, he was confronted with
the  contents  of  a  credit  report  dated  December  16,  2017.  Applicant  then  told  the
investigator  that  he  did  not  list  the  student  loans  because  he  did  not  realize  they
constituted debts to the federal government. He also stated that he was paying them on
a monthly basis. In response to the SOR, Applicant stated that he was confused by the
questions at issue and did not intend to provide false answers to the questions about his
debts. At hearing, he testified that he either did not read the questions carefully or that he
did not pay attention to what was being asked by those questions. (Answer; GX 1 – 6; Tr.
45, 55 – 57)
Applicant was re-interviewed  on  March 18, 2019, and  stated  that he  intended  to
contact  his  creditors  to   establish   a   repayment  plan.   Thereafter,  he   took   no   action
regarding  his student loans  until July  26,  2021, when  he  contacted  the  collection  agency
holding   all   ten   loans,   which  now   total  $58,135.98,  and   enrolled   in  a   student  loan
rehabilitation plan. That plan was finalized ten days before this hearing and calls for him
to pay $61 monthly for nine months. If he makes those payments as expected, his student
loans will be returned to a current status. Applicant does not know if the required monthly
payment will increase after he completes the rehabilitation plan. He has not yet made any
payments because he is availing himself of relief for student loan payments, regardless
of whether they are current or delinquent, provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and
Economic Security (CARES) Act. I take administrative notice of  the fact that in August
2021, CARES Act protections were extended to January 2022. (GX 2; AX A; Tr. 50 – 51,
61 – 62, 64 – 66)
Available information  also  shows that  Applicant still  owes the  debts alleged  at SOR
1.k –  1.m. He has not taken  any  action  on  those  debts,  which have  been  delinquent since
at least 2017,  choosing  to  wait until he  has  rehabilitated  his student loans.  Applicant also
did not list these debts in his e-QIP, but did not explain why. (GX 1  –  5; Tr. 45  –  47)
Applicant has an excellent reputation in the workplace  and his community. Four
current and former co-workers testified for Applicant. They have known him for most of
the past ten years and are aware of the financial and personal conduct issues in this case.
They have observed Applicant to be professional, reliable, honest and trustworthy. They
also  have  observed  that  he  lives  modestly  and  within  his  means,  although  those
observations are not based on any specific knowledge of his finances. (Tr. 22 – 42)
