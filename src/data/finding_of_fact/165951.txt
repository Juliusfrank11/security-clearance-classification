Applicant, age 53, is married with two adult children. He earned his high school
diploma  in  1985.  He  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  as  a  warehouse
specialist and maintained a DOD security clearance since 2014. He previously worked
in the automobile industry. (Item 3)
Applicant financed the $248,000 purchase of a home in September 2006 with a
4.25%  interest  conventional  40-year  loan.  The  monthly  payment  was  $1,871.  The
lender foreclosed on the home in September 2018, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. Applicant
does not owe a deficiency balance. (Item 2; Item 3 at 10-11, 40-41; Item 5; Item 6 at 49-
50)
In his SCA, Applicant attributed this foreclosure to being unable to refinance the
loan  with  a  “manageable  payment” because  he  owed  more  than  the  market  value.  He
asserted  that  he  worked  with  the  lender  “for  a  while”  and  made  “multiple  attempts”  to
refinance before he was informed of the foreclosure. In his SOR answer, he described
the  foreclosure  as  “the  best  financial  decision  we  could  make  for  our  family”  because
the “actual value of the home was decreasing so much that letting the house go was the
best decision.” (Item 2; Item 3 at 40-41)
During his February 2019 security clearance interview, Applicant described facts
and circumstances  related to the foreclosure  that contradicted  the record and  what  he
reported in his SCA and SOR answer. It is unclear whether he was: describing another
foreclosure,  confused about  the facts,  or being intentionally misleading.  He  mentioned
that his wife handled their finances, which could also account for the discrepancies. He
referenced a different address for a home in which he resided from 1995 through 2006,
and different loan terms. He stated that he let a friend talk him into financing a $350,000
purchase in 2006 with a short-term balloon mortgage (with 2.5% interest only payments
until  2008,  when  a  $250,000  balloon  payment  became  due).  He  described  efforts  his
wife made for three or four years to obtain a loan modification. Then, he claimed that he
did  not  find  out  about  the  foreclosure  until  an  appraiser  came  to  the  home  the  day
before the home  was scheduled for auction. At  that time, he learned  that his wife had
not  paid  the  loan  for  four  months  and  instead  used  the  money  to  help  their  married
daughter with her financial issues. He claimed that his wife  had hidden the foreclosure
notices from him.  He told  the investigator that his wife  came to understand  that  it was
time to cut the cord and let the kids manage their own lives. He also promised never to
purchase another home with a balloon loan. (Item 3 at 11; Item 7 at 2)
Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  (TY)
2015  through  2017,  as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  (for reasons not  specified  in  the  record).
They  were  received  by  the  IRS  in  July  2016,  May  2018,  and  February  2019,
respectively. (Item 2; Item 4 at 9-14)
Regarding his state income tax returns, SOR ¶ 1.f alleged that Applicant failed to
timely file for only one year: TY 2016. Because Applicant did not address this allegation
in his SOR answer, I will construe his nonresponse as a denial. The Government did not
proffer  any  documentary  evidence  to  support  this  allegation,  which  appeared  to  be
based  on  the  absence  of  a  state  income  tax  return  for  TY  2016  in  Applicant’s
documentary  production  in  response  to  interrogatories.  In  that  response,  he  provided
copies of his state income tax returns for TY 2015 (signed and dated July 2016), 2017
(signed and dated December 2018), and 2018 (unsigned and undated). While none of
the copies he provided verified the date that the returns were actually filed and received,
since  the  Government  did  not  allege  facts  concerning  those  other  late  returns,  I  have
considered  them  only  for  the  purpose  of  evaluating  mitigation  and  the  whole  person
concept. (Item 2; Item 4 at 15-32)
Applicant  failed  to  timely  pay  his  federal  income  taxes  for  TY  2015,  2017  (as
alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.d),  and  TY  2018  (unalleged).  In  February  2017,  he
established  an  installment  agreement  for  TY  2015,  which  was  terminated  in  August
2019. Between July 2017 and May 2019, he made 19 payments totaling $8,779. His tax
refunds for TY 2016 ($2,060) and TY 2014 ($213) were applied to the balance owed for
TY  2015  in  April  and  September  2017,  respectively.  In  April  2019,  he  established  an
installment agreement for TY 2017, also terminated in August 2019, pursuant to which
he did not make any payments. In November 2020, he agreed to pay $250 bi-weekly for
a  balance  totaling  $39,537  for  TY  2015,  2017,  and  2018.  In  February  2021,  he  paid
$444 to fully resolve his debt for TY 2018 and agreed to make $350 bi-weekly payments
for the remaining balance totaling $34,057 ($20,776 for TY 2015; $13,282 for TY 2017).
Applicant  did  not  proffer  evidence  of  any  payments  he  made  pursuant  to  either
agreement.  The  record  does  not  indicate  whether  the  reduction  in  balance  owed
between 2020 and 2021 reflects either payments he made or credits that were applied
to his account. (Item 2; Item 4 at 9-14; Item 6 at 51-57)
Applicant failed to timely pay his state income taxes for TY 2015, 2017, and 2018
(as alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h) and TY 2016 (unalleged). He claimed to have
paid the debt for TY 2015, without providing any proof. In November 2020, he agreed to
pay $314 per month (beginning in December 2020 for 36 months) for a balance totaling
$9,948.  While  the  agreement  did  not  reference  the  tax  years  to  which  it  applied,  the
that
totaled
include  TY  2015
balance  suggests
approximately  $9,638  ($1,565  for  TY  2015;  $1,788  for  TY  2016;  $4,625  for  TY  2017;
$1,660 for TY 2018). Applicant did not provide proof of any payments he made pursuant
to that agreement. (Item 2; Item 6 at 58)
through  2018,  which
it  may
On  his  November  2018  SCA,  Applicant  answered  “no”  to  whether,  in  the  last
seven years, he had “failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by
law  or  ordinance?”  (as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  2.a).  In  response  to  another  SCA  “financial
record”  question,  he  disclosed  a  history  of  delinquent  debts,  including  the  mortgage
account  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.  During  his  February 2019  security  clearance  interview,
he volunteered that, while he and his wife  had filed their federal and state taxes every
year, they have owed taxes that they could not pay. He estimated his combined federal
and  state  tax  debt  to  be  about  $30,000.  He  asserted  that  they  were  paying  $500  per
month to the IRS and, and that while his state debt had been paid off in TY 2016, they
owed state taxes again in TY 2017. (Item 3 at 36-42; Item 7 at 2)
In his SCA, Applicant attributed his financial issues to an almost $20,000 annual
pay reduction resulting from a loss of income associated with his work as a commission-
based automobile parts salesman due to a “drop in business.” He asserted that he had
been working with his creditors to whom he explained his situation and was trying to do
what  he  could  to  resolve  his  debts.  He  paid  two  of  the  three  credit-card  accounts
referenced  in  his  SCA  in  2013.  In  March  2019,  Applicant  outlined  a  budget  with  a
monthly net remainder of about $129, including expenses totaling $585 designated for
his state and federal taxes. The record otherwise contains scant details surrounding his
financial history. (Item 3 at 36-42; Item 7 at 3)
In his SOR answer, Applicant  explained that he misunderstood the tax question
on the SCA and answered “no” because he thought the question meant whether he filed
or  paid  taxes  at  all.  He  asserted  that  his  “no”  answer  was  not  meant  to  deceive  or
deliberately  fail  to  disclose  information.  He  apparently  believed  that  because  he  had
“filed  taxes  every  year”  and  “been  making  payments  to  the  IRS”  that  his  “no”  answer
was correct given his interpretation of what was being asked. (Item 2)
Applicant  provided  copies  of  his  TY  2019  and  2020  federal  and  state  returns
(unsigned  and  undated).  The  returns  indicated  that  he  expected  refunds  from  the  IRS
($2,016 for TY 2019;  $820  for TY 2020) and  would  owe  the state  $1,590 for TY 2019
and $1,432 for TY 2020. He did not proffer evidence of when the returns were  actually
filed  or  received,  or  of  his  tax  payments.  No  delinquent  debts  were  reported  on
Applicant’s November 2019  credit report, which is the most recent report in the record.
(Item 5; Item 6 at 39-48; 59-70)
In his SOR answer, Applicant described his financial situation as “something that
we  have  been  working  on  and  continue  to  work  on.”  He  expressed  that  he  is  happy
working for his current employer and has been a “loyal and trustworthy employee”  with
a strong work ethic. (Item 2)
