Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse

marijuana after completing an SCA. (Item 2)
In his March 27, 2019 SCA Applicant said that he occasionally smoked marijuana
from August 2008 to “January 2018,” and he said:
Occasionally   I  would  smoke   in   social   settings  with   friends  or   family.
Typically  I would smoke  at  home, by  myself, while  playing  videogames or
reading.  For  the   second   half   of  high   school   and   throughout  most   of   my
undergraduate  studies,  I would smoke  0-5  times a  week. In  graduate  school
I smoked  less,  once every  two  weeks or so.  Since  leaving  graduate school
I  have   smoked   with   decreasing   regularity,  once   every   few   months.  .  .   .  I
have  not  smoked  since  January  2019, as  part of  a  New  Years resolution, I
do not plan  to start again. (Item 3 at 104)
