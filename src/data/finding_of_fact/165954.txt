Applicant is 31 years old, single, and has no children. He received an associate’s
degree  in  information  technology  in  2016.  Since  April  2021,  he  has  worked  for  an
automobile  manufacturing  company  in  production.  This  is  his  first  security  clearance
application, and his employment with a defense contractor as a computer technician is
dependent upon him obtaining a security clearance. (GE 1; GE 3; Tr. 11-13)

Applicant  attributed  his  inability  to  make  payments  toward  his  student  loan
obligations to various periods of unemployment and  insufficient income. Applicant was
unemployed  between  August  2010  and  October  2010;  December  2013  and  February
2014;  December  2016  and  February  2017;  and  June  2018  and  October  2018.  During
these periods, he was either supported by his mother, savings, or unemployment benefits.
Additionally,  in  March  and  April  of  2020,  he  was  laid  off  for  seven  weeks  due  to  the
shuttering of his factory because of the COVID-19 pandemic. During this period, he did
not receive unemployment or his regular pay. (GE 1; GE 3; Tr. 14, 34; AE C to AE F)
Applicant  incurred  student  loans  between  approximately  2008  and  2016.  He
attended school between 2008 and 2011, returned to school in 2013, and graduated in
2016. The notices for his loans initially were sent to his mother’s house as she co-signed
for his loans. At that time, he was not living with her, and it took her a couple of months
to notify him of his mail; however, he did eventually contact his student loan creditors. He
was told that his monthly student loan payments would be approximately $500, which he
could not afford. According to Applicant, he did make a few payments toward some of the
smaller  loans  approximately  10  years  ago.  However,  he  could  not  recall  how  many
payments he made, how much he paid toward the loans, and he failed to provide proof
of any payments. (GE 1 at 10-11; GE 3 at 2; Tr. 21-23, 30)
In  his November 2019  SCA,  Applicant disclosed   that he  had  delinquent student
loans,   but he   “could   not locate   the   necessary   details on   exactly   how   much   [he] owe[d]
and which providers [he] owe[d] which amounts. (GE 1 at 43).
During  his  December  2019  interview  with  a  government  investigator,  Applicant
indicated he had lost track of his student loan obligations, but he would make an effort to
make  payments  toward  his  student  loans  once  he  had  saved  enough  money.  At  the
hearing,  he  testified  that  due to the  COVID-19 pandemic, he  was unable  to make  any
payments. (GE 3; Tr. 23-24)
At  the  time  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  was  waiting  to  hear  from  his  student  loan
creditors regarding a rehabilitation program for him to transition his loans from delinquent
status into good standing. He could not recall when he contacted his creditors to initiate
this program, nor had he signed any paperwork. (Tr. 20, 32)
According  to  Applicant,  his  student  loans  qualify  for  deferment  under  the
Coronavirus  Aid,  Relief,  and  Economic  Security  (CARES)  Act.  He  failed  to  provide
documentation to support this claim at the hearing or after the hearing. (Tr. 24, 31-32, 37)
At the time of the hearing, Applicant was earning $18.95 an hour, which was $3 to
$4  more  than  he  had  ever  earned  from  a  previous  employer.  With  overtime,  his  net
monthly income is typically $3,000. The month before the hearing, he had a surplus of
$1,000, after he paid his bills. Additionally, in February 2021, Applicant hired a financial
coach  to  help  him  manage  his  spending,  eliminate  bad  financial  habits,  and  create  a
budget.  He  did  not  provide  a  copy  of  his  budget  or  details  related  to  the  financial
counseling. (Tr. 24-29)
Applicant does not currently have any money in savings. He provided copies of his
tax filings for tax years 2017 through 2020, and his annual federal adjusted gross income
ranged between $23,020 and $31,233. He also provided statements for his car insurance
and car loan, demonstrating these accounts were current and in good standing.  (Tr. 30;
AE A - F)
