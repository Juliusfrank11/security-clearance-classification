Applicant  is  a  46-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  where  he  has
worked since January 2019. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1996 until
he  retired  with  an  honorable  discharge  as  a  chief  warrant  officer-3  in  2018.  He  has  a
bachelor’s  degree,  which  he  earned  in  2015,  and  post-graduate  credits  towards  a
master’s degree. He is married with two children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 24-26; GE 1)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  problems,  including  delinquent  debts  and
criminal  charges  for  passing  bad  checks.  In  1998,  he  was  charged  with  the
misdemeanor offense of fraud – insufficient funds check. He pleaded guilty in 1999 in a
deferred  adjudication.  He  was  fined  $200.  In  February  2015,  he  was  arrested  and
charged with the misdemeanor offense of theft of property less than $500 by check. The
date of the offense was reported to be in October 2014. (Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 7)
Applicant  stated   that   he   was  solicited   by   a   door-to-door   salesman   for  a   local
newspaper.  He  wrote  a  check  for  $25  and  gave  it to  the  salesman. His wife  then  gave
Applicant $25  in  cash, which Applicant  gave  to  the  salesman. He  asked the  salesman to
rip  up  the  check.  The  salesman  ripped  something  up  in  front  of him, but  it was not the
check.   Applicant   stopped   payment   on   the   check  “to   be   safe.”  He   was  unaware  the
newspaper attempted  to  cash  the  check until he  was stopped  for a  minor traffic offense,
and  the  warrant was discovered. The  charge  was dismissed  two  days later.  (Tr.  at  55-
57; Applicant’s  response to  SOR; GE 7)
Applicant was stopped for a traffic violation in September 2016. He was arrested
when it was discovered that he had two warrants from 2000 for passing bogus checks.
In October 2017, he pleaded guilty to the two charges  in a deferred judgment. He was
ordered to pay $50 in fines, plus court costs, and $10 in restitution for the two offenses.
In October 2019, the court determined that all of the conditions of the deferred judgment
were  satisfied.  The  charges  were  dismissed,  and  the  record  expunged.  (Tr.  at  56;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 6, 7)
In  October  2008,  the  then  U.S.  Army  Central  Personnel  Security  Clearance
Facility (CCF) notified Applicant that it intended to revoke his security clearance based
on  his  finances  (delinquent  debts)  and  personal  conduct  (not  reporting  his  delinquent
debts  on  his  security  clearance  application).  His  security  clearance  was  suspended
pending adjudication. After considering Applicant’s November 2008 response, the CCF
granted  Applicant’s security  clearance  in May 2009, with  the  warning  that “subsequent
unfavorable  information  may  result  in  the  suspension  of  your  clearance.”  There  is  no
evidence that Applicant was informed that his security clearance was suspended or that
he received a copy of the warning notice.1 (GE 8)
1 These matters were not alleged in the SOR and will not be used for disqualification purposes. They may
be considered for the purpose of placing Applicant on notice of the importance of maintaining his finances
in order and of providing accurate information on a security clearance application.
The delinquent debts in the current SOR were based on credit reports obtained
in  October  2016,  June  2019,  and  Match  2020.  Applicant  attributed  his  financial
problems  to  prioritizing  his  military  service  over  his  finances.  He  deployed  to  Iraq  and
Afghanistan,  and he  served  in  the  Republic of  Korea.  He estimated  that  he was  away
from home about 12 of the 22 years he served  in the military. There were separations
from  his  family  where  he  had  to  maintain  two  households.  His  wife  had  a  medical
condition that prevented her from working. His wife  handled the majority of the family’s
finances,  and  he  was  not  always  aware  of  the  status  of  their  finances.  He  contracted
with a debt-resolution company in June 2019 to assist him in disputing inaccurate items
on his credit report. (Tr. at 20-22, 34-36, 60-61; GE 1, 3-5; AE G)
Applicant and his wife borrowed about $35,470 from a financial institution in May
2015  to  finance  a  used  2013  sport  utility  vehicle  (SUV)  with  about  15,000  miles.  The
payments were $759 per month for 72 months. He stated that he bought a 100,000 mile
extended  warranty  from  the  dealer.  The  SUV  had  problems  with  the  transmission  in
about  July  2017.  The  dealer  told  him  that  the  problems  were  not  covered  by  the
warranty, and the repairs would cost about $2,200. Applicant believes that the warranty
should have covered the repairs. He decided not to repair the SUV and contacted the
finance company to repossess it. (Tr. at 27-31, 33-34; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE
3-5)
Applicant  stated  that  $12,539  remained  on  the  auto  loan  when  they  stopped
making payments. The October 2016 credit report lists the account as $1,879 past due,
with  a  balance  of  $33,097.  The  June  2019  and  March  2020  credit  reports  list  the
account  as  $28,944  past  due,  with  the  same  amount  as  the  balance.  The  September
2020  credit  report  lists  the  account  as  charged  off  with  a  balance  of  $12,539.  The
amount is almost assuredly the deficiency balance on the loan after the SUV was sold
by  the  finance  company,  and  not  what  remained  on  the  account  when  they  stopped
making  payments.  Applicant  stated  that  he  was  never  contacted  by  the  finance
company about any balance due. The  credit-repair company is disputing the debt. (Tr.
at 28, 31-32; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3-5)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges $12,272 owed to a financial institution that specializes in loans
to  military  members.  The  October  2016  credit  report  lists  the  account  as  opened  in
August 2015 with $287 payments per month for 36 months. The high credit was $6,770.
The  account  was  reported  as  charged  off  for  $6,100,  with  a  balance  of  the  same
amount. The date of last action was March 2016. The June 2019 credit report lists the
account as $12,272 past due, with the same amount as the balance.  The credit-repair
company disputed the debt, and it does not appear on the March 2020 credit report. (Tr.
at 32-46; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3-5)
Applicant  stated  that  he  paid  the  loan  until  the  financial  institution  raised  the
interest rate in violation of their contract. He admitted that he borrowed about $6,100 or
$6,700, but he believes he owed $2,272 when he stopped paying the loan. That figure
does  not  add  up  when  the  amount  borrowed  (at  least  $6,100  in  August  2015),  the
amount  of  the  monthly  payments  ($278),  and  the  date  the  payments  stopped  (March
2016) are all factored in. I find the most accurate amount to be $6,100, which is what he
owed in September 2016 when the loan was charged off. (Tr. at 32, 37-46; Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 3-5)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  a  $7,266  charged-off  auto  loan  owed  to  the  same  financial
institution  that  provided  the  charged-off  auto  loan  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.  Applicant
essentially denied owing the debt, stating it was consolidated into the  SOR ¶ 1.a debt.
The  credit-repair  company  disputed  the  debt.  The  October  2016  credit  report  lists  the
account as a separate auto loan that was opened in August 2015, with a high credit of
$15,341  and  a  balance  of  $14,627.  The  loan  was  current  as  of  that  credit  report.  The
June 2019 credit report lists the charged-off account as $7,266 past due, with the same
amount as the balance. The March and September 2020 credit reports list the account
as charged off with a past-due amount and balance of $7,175. I conclude that the loans
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c are two separate auto loans; Applicant is responsible for
both; and he has not paid either. (Tr. at 52-54; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3-5)
Applicant denied owing the $870 (SOR ¶ 1.d) and $686 (SOR ¶ 1.e) debts owed
to  the  same  bank.  He  stated  that  the  credit-repair  company  was  able  to  remove  the
debts from his credit report. Applicant did not provide the basis of the dispute. The debts
are listed on the October 2016 and June 2019 credit reports as becoming delinquent in
2012 and 2013 and charged off in 2013. The debts are not reported on any subsequent
credit  report. The debts  are  past  the  seven-year  reporting  window,  so  they  should  not
be  listed  on  the  later  reports  regardless  of  whether  they  were  disputed.  (Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 3-5)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a $738 delinquent debt owed to a financial institution, but that
amount appears to  be based on a misreading of  the  credit  reports. The October 2016
credit  report lists  the account as  current  with a  balance  of  $490. The  two more  recent
credit  reports  list  the  account  as  $738  and  $797  past  due,  with  a  balance  of  $490.  I
consider $490 to be the correct amount that was owed. Applicant stated that he settled
the  debt  over  the  phone  for  $350  in  December  2020,  but  he  did  not  have  a  receipt.
Post-hearing, he submitted proof that he paid $490 to the creditor on July 23, 2021. (Tr.
at 46-48; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3-5; AE B)
Applicant initially  stated  that he  did not consider the  $467  debt alleged  in SOR ¶
1.g  to  be  valid, and  the  credit-repair  company  was disputing  the  debt.  The  debt  became
delinquent  in  about September  2014.  He  paid the  debt in  full  in  July  2021.  (Tr. at 48-49,
51; Applicant’s response to  SOR; GE 3-5; AE F)
SOR  ¶  1.h  alleges  a  $460  delinquent  debt  for  an  apartment  lease.  Applicant
stated  that he exercised  the military clause in  the contract to end the  lease early,  and
that  he  paid  the  last  month’s  rent  in  about  November  2017.  He  stated  that  he
nonetheless  decided  to  accept  a  settlement  of  the  debt  for  $230,  which  he  paid  in
December  2020.  Applicant  stated  that  he  did  not  have  a  receipt.  Post-hearing,  he
submitted  proof  that  he  paid  $345  to  the  creditor  on  July  1,  2021.  (Tr.  at  51-52;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3-5; AE C, D)
Applicant denied owing the $371 (SOR ¶ 1.i) and $353 (SOR ¶ 1.j) debts owed to
financial  institutions.  He  stated  that  the  credit-repair  company  was  able  to  remove  the
debts from his credit report. Applicant did not provide the basis of the dispute. The $371
debt  is  listed  on  the  June  2019,  March  2020,  and  September  2020  Equifax  and
TransUnion credit reports with a date of last action of May 2016. The $353 debt is listed
on  the  October  2016  and  June  2019  credit  reports  with  a  date  of  last  action  of
September 2014. The debt is not reported on any subsequent credit report. (Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 3-5)
SOR  ¶  1.k  alleges  a  $474  charged-off  debt.  Applicant  stated  that  he  does  not
consider the debt valid, and the credit-repair company was disputing the debt. Applicant
did not provide the basis of the dispute. The debt is listed by TransUnion on the October
2016  combined  credit  report,  with  a  date  of  last  action  of  September  2014.  It  is  also
listed on the September 2020 TransUnion credit report.  Applicant stated that he called
the  creditor  and  was  informed  that  they  had  no  outstanding  balance  on  the  account.
(Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3-5)
Applicant denied owing the $151 debt to a cable provider (SOR ¶ 1.i). He stated
that  he  was  the  victim  of  identity  theft,  and he  personally  resolved  the  matter  with  the
cable provider. The debt is listed on the October 2016 credit report with an activity date
of  March 2012.  The  debt  is not  reported  on  any  subsequent  credit  report.  (Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 3-5)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
September 2016. He reported his 2016 arrest for the bogus check charges from 2000.
He reported that he was investigated for a security clearance in 2006. He reported that
he  had  never  had  a  security  clearance  “denied,  suspended,  or  revoked.”  He  did  not
report any adverse matter or delinquent debts under the financial questions. (GE 1)
Applicant denied intentionally providing false information on the SF 86. He stated
that he never received an SOR in 2008, and he was unaware that his security clearance
had  been  suspended.  His  statement  that  he  never  received  the  2008  SOR  is
contradicted  by  his  signed,  detailed  response  to  that  SOR.  There  is  no  documentary
evidence  that  he  was  informed  that  his  security  clearance  was  suspended  or  that  he
received a copy of the warning notice. Applicant stated that his wife handled the family’s
finances, and he was unaware of the extent of his financial problems when he submitted
the SF 86. (Tr. at 23, 58, 64; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant submitted a letter attesting to his excellent job performance and strong
moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his  dedication,  work  ethic,  reliability,  and
trustworthiness. (Applicant’s response to SOR)
