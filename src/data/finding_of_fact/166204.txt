Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR,  with  explanations.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  37-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  She  has  been
employed with the defense contractor for “about two and a half years.” She is divorced,
and  has  two  children,  ages  sixteen  and  three.  (TR at  page  14  line  13  to  page  16  line
25.) Applicant attributes her current financial difficulties to her 2015 divorce, a “split up”
with a subsequent boyfriend, and to brief periods of unemployment. (TR at page 19 line
2 to page 20 line 16.) She has recently completed financial counseling. (AppX J.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a.,   1.b.,   1.d.~1.h.,  and   1.aa.~1.dd.  Applicant  is  indebted   to   the   Department   of
Education, for student loans,  in an  amount totaling  about $63,000. (AppX  A  at page  1.)
She  has  entered   into  a   rehabilitation   plan   with   the   Department of  Education,   by   which
Applicant  will  make   monthly   payments  of   $40   for  nine   months;  and   as   a   result,  this
student loan  debt  will be  taken  out of  default. (TR at page  17  line  24  to  page  26  line  21,
at page  55  lines 1~12,  and  at page  58  line  23  to  page  59  line  13.) This is evidenced  by
said agreement with the Department of Education. (AppX G.)
1.c.  Applicant  is  indebted  to  Creditor  C  in  the  amount  of  about  $8,650  as  the
result of an 2019 automobile repossession. (TR at page 26 line 22 to page 28 line 10,
and  at  page  59  line  13  to  page  60  line  3.)  She  is  making  monthly  payments  of  $200
towards this “repo” debt, as evidenced by a “payment receipt” from Creditor C. (Id., and
AppX K.)
1.i.  Applicant  has  a  past-due  debt  with  Creditor  I  in  the  amount  of  about  $227.
Applicant  is  in  the  process  of  making  monthly  payments  of  $20,  for  a  period  of  ten
months,  towards  this phone  bill.  (TR at page  28  line  11  to  page  30  line  3, at  page  60
lines  4~10,  see  also  AppX  N.)  As  there  is  no  other  evidence  in  the  record  supporting
these payments, it is unclear if she is making said payments.
1.j.  Applicant had a past-due debt with Creditor J in the amount of about $222.
She is current with her electricity provider, as evidenced by a current bill from Creditor J.
(TR at page 30 line 4 to page 31 line 11, at page 60 lines 11~19, and AppX M.)
1.k.  Applicant has a past-due debt with Creditor K in the amount of about $198.
In her answer, Applicant refers to her “current Experian credit report.” That credit report
shows that said debt is still “past due.” (AppX Q seven pages from the last page.) At her
hearing, Applicant avers “It’s paid.” The status of this previously admitted, past-due debt
is unclear.
1.l. and  1.m. Applicant had past-due debts to the Department of Veterans Affairs
totaling  about  $1,354.  These  debts  are  no  longer  past  due,  as  evidenced  by  the
Government’s  most  recent  credit  report.  (TR  at  page  33  line  2  to  page  34  line  13,  at
page 60 lines 20~25, and GX 2 at pages 8~9.)
1.n~1.r. Applicant is indebted to ECMC (Navient), for student loans, in an amount
totaling about $33,000. Repayment is determined by way of an income-based program;
and as such, Applicant is current with her payments. (TR at page 35 line 14 to page 37
line  20,  at  page  55  line  15  to  page  56  line  16,  and  at  page  61  lines  1~17.)  This  is
evidenced by documentation from Navient. (AppX S.)
1.s.   Applicant  had  a  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  S  in  the  amount  of  about  $921.
Applicant  successfully  disputed  this  debt;  and  as  such,  This  debt  does  not  appear  on
either  the  Government’s  2019  and  2021  credit  reports  (GX  2  and  3),  nor  on  the
Applicant’s 2019 credit reports (AppXs T). (TR at page 40 line 7 to page 41 line 14, and
at page 61 lines 18~21.)
1.t.  Applicant had a past-due debt to Creditor T in the amount of about $3,133.
Applicant  successfully  disputed  this  debt;  and  as  such,  her  debt  does  not  appear  on
neither  the  Government’s  2019  or  2021  credit  reports  (GX  2  and  3),  or  on  the
Applicant’s 2019 credit report (AppXs T). (TR at page 41 line 15 to page 42 line 22, and
at page 61 lines 22~25.) This debt is no longer past due.
1.u.~1.x.  Applicant  had  past-due  medical  bills  totaling  about  $492.  Applicant
successfully disputed these debts; and as such, these debts do not appear on either the
Government’s  2019  and  2021  credit  reports  (GX  2  and  3),  or  on  the  Applicant’s  2019
credit report (AppXs T). (TR at page 42 line 23 to page 44 line 1, and at page 62 lines
1~4.) These debts are no longer past due.
1.y.  Applicant  had  a  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  Y  in  the  amount  of  about  $635.
Applicant successfully disputed this debt, as evidenced by documentation. (TR at page
44 lines 2~16, at page 62 lines 5~11, and AppXs L and U.) This debt is no longer past
due.
1.z.  Applicant  had  a  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  Z  in  the  amount  of  about  $64.
Applicant  settled  and  paid  this  debt,  as  evidenced  by  documentation.  (TR  at  page  34
line 13 to page 35 line 12, at page 62 lines 12~15, and AppX P.) This debt is no longer
past due.
1.ee  and  1.ff. Applicant filed her Federal and state income tax returns for tax year
2016. (TR at page 44 line 16 to page 45 line 9, at page 45 line 16 to page 46 line 4, at
page 62 lines 16~24, and AppX H.)
