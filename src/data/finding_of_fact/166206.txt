Applicant denied the sole SOR allegation. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 49  years old. She  earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in 1996. She  married  in
1995  and  divorced  in 2000. She  has two  children  from  the  marriage, ages 26  and  23. She
has a  child  from  another  relationship who  is 19  years old. She  is the  president  and  chief
executive  officer of  her  own  company, a  small  business, since  2009. (Transcript (Tr.)  16-
17; GE 1)
The  sole allegation  in  the  SOR is that Applicant owes delinquent federal taxes in
the  amount of $90,875  for tax  year 2015. Applicant disputes  the  allegation. She  testified
that after filing  her 2015  federal income  tax  return she  owed  taxes. She  stated  that  she
runs her business as an  “S” corporation  and  when  she  files her tax  returns  the  income
from  her business is included  in her personal income  and  taxable. When  she  completed
her 2015  federal income  tax  return  in 2016,  she  was unable to  pay  the  tax  liability  because
her company  had  lost  a  large  contract that normally  would have  generated  cash  income
to  pay  the  tax  liability. Instead  she  had  a  cash  flow  problem. She  made  a  $5,000  payment
toward her 2015  tax  debt,  but could  not pay  the  whole amount. She  testified  that at the
time  she  filed  the  appropriate  forms with  the  IRS to  arrange  a  payment plan. She  stated
she  never received  a  response  from  the  IRS  on  her request. She  is  the  sole owner of  the
company  and is personally  responsible  for all taxes owed, personal  and  payroll. (Tr. 18-
20, 26)
Applicant provided a spreadsheet indicating the payments she made to the IRS to
be applied to her 2015 tax debt. It shows that in 2016 she made a $5,000 payment and
her 2016 tax refund of $1,863 was applied  to the  2015 debt. Applicant testified that in
November  2017  she  made  an  electronic  payment  of  $71,340  to  the  IRS  for  her  2015
personal income tax debt. At the time, she believed that this satisfied her 2015 tax debt
and  it  was  resolved.  However,  she  testified  that  this  payment  was  applied  to  her
company’s payroll  tax account.  Because  it was not applied  to  her personal income  tax
debt, penalties and interest continued to accrue. She provided a copy of her letter to the
IRS from April 2020 requesting the IRS reallocate the payment to her personal account
instead  of  her  payroll  account,  which  she  believes  was  erroneous.  The  letter  also
requested that because she believed the IRS made an error that penalties and interest
be waived. She submitted the letter as an Offer in Compromise (OIC). Applicant testified
that she did not become aware until late 2018 that her personal income tax payment was
applied to her payroll account. A federal tax lien for $65,638 was entered in August 2017.
(Tr. 20, 26, 28-32, 38, 45; GE 5; AE A)
Applicant testified that she was late in paying her payroll taxes at the time, but they
were  paid.  The  $71,340  she  paid  was  applied  to  the  penalties  and  interest  that  had
accrued for the payroll taxes. She said she paid the payroll taxes, but on the wrong day,
hence accruing penalties and interest. (Tr. 20, 26, 28-32, 38, 45; GE 5; AE A)
Applicant  testified  that  she  was  proactive  in  working  with  a  local  IRS  agent  to
negotiate a payment plan and pay the tax owed. Applicant said that the local IRS agent
would not provide a letter attesting to Applicant’s attempts to resolve the issues because
it was against IRS policy to do so. Applicant requested the IRS assign a case manager
to address the problems with her case and correct the allocation. She was advised that
one has not been assigned to-date and has been delayed due to the pandemic. Applicant
noted her frustration because she believed the local IRS agent could see that Applicant
had made payments, but could not make changes until a case manager was assigned
and it went through the IRS review process. (Tr. 18, 21, 23-27 GE 6)
Applicant admitted that she did not timely pay her 2015 federal income taxes due
to corporate financial issues, but she has paid the debt. She understands the importance
of paying her taxes and debts on time. The unexpected loss of a large contract created a
cash flow problem, and she was unable to pay the large tax debt on time. She takes full
responsibility for her tax debts and explained she did the best she could at the time. She
further testified that in 2016 when she realized she was unable to fully pay the 2015 tax
debt, she contacted her corporate attorney who advised her that the fees associated with
his  service  likely  would  be  considerable  due  to  the  delays  normally  associated  with
dealing with the IRS. He recommended that she deal directly with the IRS.  (Tr. 26, 37,
50-51)
On her February 2019 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed
her IRS debt and that she had requested a payment plan with the IRS, but was waiting
for a response. During her April 2019 background investigation she also disclosed this
information and circumstances regarding her tax debt. (GE 1, 7)
Applicant’s  2015 IRS  tax transcript  shows  the  $5,000  payment  in October 2016
when she filed her tax return and her 2016 tax year refund that was applied to her debt.
A refund of $39,028 from tax year 2019 was applied to the debt. The transcript reflects
that in March 2021, Applicant submitted an offer in compromise to the IRS. No response
to date was reflected in the transcript. Three payments of $15,000 were made in May,
June, and August 2021. The transcript reflects a balance owed of $11,196. Applicant also
provided a copy of a $25,000 check to the IRS from February 2021. She stated that she
requested the IRS apply a portion of the amount to satisfy any remaining balance owed
for  tax  year  2015.  Applicant  stated  in  her  post-hearing  letter  that  she  believed  her
payments should satisfy her 2015 tax debt. She believes she should have a credit in her
account based on her payments to the IRS. She was advised by the IRS that release of
the lien could take up to 60 days. She testified that she timely paid all of her taxes for the
subsequent  tax  years  and  she  is  paying  estimated  taxes  to  ensure  there  is  sufficient
money to pay future taxes owed. (Tr. 26-35, 39-42; GE 2; AE F, G, H)
Applicant explained that it is still important to her that the $71,328 that she paid
toward her 2015 personal income tax debt be allocated to her personal account instead
of  her  payroll  account.  Applicant  believes  that  had  the  $71,328  been  applied  to  her
personal  income  tax  account  and  not  payroll,  she  would  not  have  accrued  significant
penalties  and  interest.  Regardless  of  how  it  was  applied,  Applicant  was  equally
responsible for both. The IRS decides which delinquent account to apply payments to.
(Tr. 42-44, 47, 49)
A  character  letter  from  a  business  associate  of  Applicant’s  describes  her  as  a
resilient  leader  who  openly  communicates  with  clients.  There  are  no  delinquencies  or
past-due debts reflected in Applicant’s March 2019 and February 2020 credit reports. (GE
3, 4; AE D)
