FINANCIAL
The  SOR  alleges  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  -1.l  that  Applicant  has  12  student  loan  debts
placed in collection in the approximate amount of $38,000, and one consumer collection
account in the amount of $160. (SOR¶ 1.m) Applicant admitted all the student loan debts,
but denied 1.m as she has no idea what the account represents. (Answer to SOR) The
student loans are from 2010 to 2014. (Tr. 24)
Applicant attributes her inability to pay her student loans to low paying jobs, helping
her siblings pay their tuition, and helping her mother who had a stroke. She believes that
she made some small payments in 2017 or 2018, and she believed she received a phone
call that  her student loans were deferred. (Tr. 25) She thought the payments were $25 a
month.  (Tr.  26)  She  added  that  the  money  was  being  deducted  from  her  checking
account. Applicant stated that she could not get statements from her bank to substantiate
the  payments.  (Tr.  27)  However,  she  insisted  that  the  loans  were  kept  in  deferment
indefinitely  because  she  could  not  pay.  (Tr.30)  She  believes  that  she  talked  to  the
Department of Education about six months ago and was told to call back when she could
pay.
She worked in the state where her mother lived and moved to another state to find
work. She found a part-time job during the holidays. (Tr. 28) She stated that she never
made more than $40,000. She was not clear when that was.  At one point she thought
that maybe she was paying money to a scammer. (Tr. 36)
In 2019, Applicant secured a full time job for one year, but she claims that she was
still not making enough money to pay anything on the student loans. (Tr. 38) She is firm
in her belief that she never received any paper work from the Department of Education.
She stated that they always called her. She has no idea how much she has paid on the
student loans in the past seven years.  She admitted that she had another full time job
from 2016 to 2017, but made no payments on the student loans. She believes her hourly
wages varied from $13 to $16 to perhaps $30.
Applicant  wants  to  pay  her  student  loans  and  interviews  often.  However,  the
money she earns goes to financially helping her mother. Applicant travels between states.
She  acknowledged  that  before  COVID,  she  has  not  made  any  efforts  to  pay.  (Tr.  47)
When   asked   specifically   where  does  her   money   go,   Applicant   responded   for  her  car
payment,  and  rent to  her mother, and  car insurance. She  borrows money  from  family. (Tr.
50)  She  has no  real savings.  (Tr. 52)  Applicant received  some  unemployment benefits
and some COVID stimulus money.
