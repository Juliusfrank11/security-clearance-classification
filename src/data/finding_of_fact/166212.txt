The six allegations of the SOR total $55,142 in unpaid taxes and delinquent debt.
SOR 1.a alleges that Applicant owes $30,000 in federal taxes for tax year 2016. SOR 1.b
alleges that Applicant did not file a federal tax return for 2013. He admitted SOR 1.a and
claimed he was paying the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $250 a month.  He admitted
SOR 1.b. He pointed to his job lay off as the reason he did not file his federal tax return
for 2013.
Applicant admitted the remaining allegations SOR 1.c through 1.f. He claimed he
was making arrangements to pay the delinquent account in SOR 1.c. He claimed that his
December 2020 payment satisfied the balance owed to the SOR 1.d collection agency.
He explained that the delinquent $21,103 account in SOR 1.e is for a boat repossession.
He did not know about the SOR 1.f account.
Applicant is 61 years old.  He served on active duty in the United States Army
(USA) from 1978 to September 1982. (Item 3 at 14-15) He has been married since 1986
to his second wife, following his divorce from his first wife in 1981. He is the father of six
adult children. (Item 3 at 18-27)
According  to  his  June  2017  e-QIP,  Applicant  has  been  working  as  a  field
technician since April 2014. From January to April 2014, he was machine operator. He
was  unemployed  from  June  to  December  2013,  due  to  a  lay  off  after  28  years  of
employment as an information technician (IT) for an insurance company. He is seeking
his first security clearance. (Item 3 at 35)
Regarding SOR 1.a, Applicant explained in his June 2017 e-QIP that he did not
pay $30,000 in federal taxes for tax year 2016. He submitted one $250 check addressed
to the U.S. Treasury, but provided no documentation of the current status of the SOR 1.a
federal tax balance.  His reasons for not paying the taxes are  unclear. His initial vague
reference  to  his  retirement  paying  the  tax  amount  makes  no  sense.  His  subsequent
statement that the IRS wanted him to file his 2013 federal tax return  (SOR 1.b) before
they provide him a payment plan for federal tax year 2016, is more understandable. His
claim that his computer stopped working does not justify his failure to file his 2013 federal
tax return through some other means. (Item 3 at 36-37)
Applicant  claimed  that  he  was  making  arrangements  to  pay  the  delinquent
account in SOR 1.c. No additional information was provided regarding the status of the
arrangements.
In  support  of  his  claim  that  the  collection  agency  in  SOR  1.d  was  paid  in  full,
Applicant provided a $164 debit payment that was posted on December 28, 2020. There
is  no  documentation,  i.e.,  cancelled  checks,  bank  ledgers  or  statements  describing  a
record of consistent payments, I am unable to accept Applicantâ€™s claim that the account
was paid in full. See, Item 5 at 2.
In  his  answer  to  SOR  1.e,  Applicant  indicated  that  the  delinquent  account  he
owed  the  insurance  company  was  for  a  boat  that  was  repossessed.  He  furnished  no
additional documentation to describe the current status of the account.
Item  4 at page 3  verifies  the  account  alleged  in  SOR  1.f. The  joint-installment
finance account was opened in 1986. The account payments were $240 a month, and the
account was charged off in May 2015.
Applicant claimed that he was receiving financial counseling and his mortgage
lender helped him achieve more reasonable mortgage payments. He explained that his
mortgage was restored to a current status after he sold off some personal property. (Item
3 at 37-39) Due to the fact that Applicant provided no documented evidence of financial
counseling  or  a  budget,  it  is  impossible  to  determine  what  his  financial  management
practices are and how he intends to resolve the commercial debts, the unpaid taxes, the
and missing 2013 federal tax return.
