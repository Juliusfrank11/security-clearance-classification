Applicant,  49,  has  worked  for  a  federal  contracting  company  since  November
2019. He was initially granted access to classified information in 1991, in connection with
his  military  service,  and  was  granted  special  program  access  in  approximately  2004.
Applicant completed his most recent security clearance application in August 2019. He
did  not  disclose  any  derogatory  information.  The  background  investigation  developed
information that Applicant owed over $63,000 on four charged-off auto loans, which are
alleged in the SOR as ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d. (Tr. 116, 122; GE 1, GE 2)
Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  1991  to  2017,  when  he
retired  as  an  E-7.  Between  1999  and  2017,  he  served  as  the  crew  chief  of  a  special
operations aviation regiment. Due to the nature of his job, Applicant was on a continuous
alert cycle or continuous rotation cycle for 16 years. He spent approximately 280 days, or
78% of each year on deployments. According to Applicant, his successful Army career
would not have been possible without his wife of 23 years, who took care of their home
and family. She was responsible for their family finances, including the household budget
and filing of their tax returns. She also held a power of attorney empowering her to act on
Applicant’s behalf. During his brief time at home, Applicant focused on spending time with
the couple’s daughter, and not the family’s financial issues. Applicant explained that he
trusted his wife implicitly to handle their affairs. (Tr. 116-127; GE 1)
In  April  2012,  Applicant’s  wife  and  her  sister  decided  to  open  a  commercial
cleaning business. Applicant’s sister-in-law is eight years older than his wife. She viewed
her  sister  as  another  mother  figure  and  trusted  her.  Between  Applicant’s  wife’s
employment in commercial real estate property management and her sister’s experience
operating  a  small  business,  Applicant’s  wife  believed  they  could  run  a  successful
business.  Applicant’s  sister-in-law  was  responsible  for  the  business  operations  and
accounting. Applicant’s wife assumed the role of financing the business, and invested the
salary from her full-time job as a commercial property manager into the company. She
also  personally purchased  three  vehicles and  transferred  one  of  the  couple’s personal
vehicles to the business to provide transportation to staff. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.d) The bank
originated  the  vehicle  loans  with  Applicant  and  his  wife  as  co-debtors;  however,
Applicant’s wife testified that Applicant did not sign any of the loan origination documents.
Applicant  recalls  that  his  wife  discussed  the  business  idea  with  him.  He  did  not  have
anything to do with the business operations and was deployed while the business was in
operation. (Tr. 38-40, 45, 48, 77, 87-89, 107-110,127; AE J-M, P)
In  April  2013,  Applicant’s  wife  learned  that  her  sister  failed  to  pay  the  state
business taxes. She then began to suspect that her sister was not properly managing the
business. Shortly, thereafter, Applicant’s  wife learned that her sister was taking money
from the business. Applicant’s wife  asked  her sister if  she  could  review  the  business’s
accounting records. Her sister objected. The two women argued, resulting  in her sister
abandoning  the  enterprise.  In  retaliation,  Applicant’s  sister-in-law  made  a  complaint  to
Applicant’s wife’s employer,  a commercial property management company,  resulting in
her termination. Applicant’s wife has been unemployed since then. Despite her efforts to
keep the business going, the business ceased operations in 2014. Applicant learned of
the  business  failure  and  his  wife’s  problems  with  her  sister  during  one  of  his  stints  at
home. He inquired as to whether she required his help to resolve any  lingering issues
related to the business. After assuring him that she did not require his help, Applicant did
not intervene further into the matter. (Tr. 45-46, 48, 78-81, 109, 127-128; AE N-O, Q-R)
Applicant  continued  his  rigorous  deployment  schedule,  assuming  that  his  wife
resolved  all  the  issues  related  to  the  failed  business.  It  was  not  until  2015,  during  a
background interview he completed in connection with a periodic reinvestigation, did he
learn  otherwise.  After  the  interview,  he  confronted  his  wife  about  the  accounts.  She
assured him that she was working to resolve the issues. Applicant authorized his wife to
use $7,000 from his thrift savings plan to resolve the business debts. He deployed again,
believing  that  his  wife  had  the  issue  under  control.  Applicant  began  his  current  job  in
November 2019, supporting his former military unit. When he completed his most recent
security clearance application in August 2019, he was under the impression that he wife
was  making  payments  on  the  auto  loans.  He  continued  to  hold  that  belief  when  he
completed his November 2020 answer to the SOR. (Tr. 41, 130, 139-141, 143; GE 2; AE
S)
At the hearing, Applicant’s wife explained that she paid the accounts sporadically
between 2013 and April 2018, when she stopped making payments altogether because
of  their  limited  income.  Between  2017  and  2019,  both  Applicant  and  his  wife  were
unemployed.  The family lived off of Applicant’s retirement pay and disability benefits. In
2018,  Applicant,  his  wife,  and   daughter  were  diagnosed   with   a   medical  condition   that
requires ongoing  treatments  that  costs  $7,500  each  month.  They  pay  the  costs  upfront
and  are reimbursed  by  their  insurance  provider within 60  to  90  days of  their  filing  a  claim.
She  also explained  that the  ability  to  repay  the  loans was also affected  by  the  transitional
nature  of their  lives between  2017  and  2019. The  couple  did  not have  a  permanent home,
living  with  different  family  members over the  course  of those  two  years as they  tried  to
find  a  home.  The  couple  lived  with  Applicant’s  wife’s brother from  2018  to  2019,  when  he
died   by   suicide   in  a   fire   that  consumed   his  home,  which  also  contained   some   of
Applicant’s family’s possessions and  personal documents.  (Tr. 55-59, 60, 62, 110, 112-
113, 147, 167, 169; AE S, Y-Z)
In late 2019, Applicant’s wife contacted the original creditor servicing the four auto
loans to resume payments, but learned the debt had been sold to a collection agency. In
2019, she received a settlement offer from the collection agency, but that agency sold the
debt to another company before she could start making  payments. In March 2021, the
new  creditor  contacted  Applicant’s  wife.  They  negotiated  a  settlement  amount  and
established a payment plan of $800 each month to begin in April 2021. After making two
payments, the creditor sold the account to the current collection agency. Applicant’s wife
continued to make payments to the current creditor under the terms she negotiated with
the previous collection agency. The current creditor did not immediately acknowledge the
agreement, but accepted the payments. In June 2021, the current creditor agreed to settle
the accounts for $39,581. Under the terms of the agreement, Applicant must make two
payments, an initial payment of  $800 and another lump sum payment of  $37,181. The
couple plans to take advantage of the offer, using proceeds from the reimbursements of
their medical expenses and federal income tax refunds, and if necessary their $10,000
savings. (Tr.60, 63-65, 67-71, 99-106,143; AE C, V-U, X)
Applicant’s wife  still maintains primary responsibilities for managing the  couple’s
finances. However, the couple operates in a more collaborative manner. They completed
a  financial  counseling  class  through  their  church  and  have  developed  a  household
budget. The couple is financially stable. They have established a  permanent residence
and purchased a home in which they have approximately $63,000 in equity to use toward
the resolution of their debt. Applicant currently earns $110,000 annually in addition to his
$12,000 in combined retirement and disability income. The couple lives within their means
and  does  not  have  a  history  of  other  financial  problems.  Aside  from  the  four  auto
accounts,  the  couple  does  not  have  any  other  delinquent  accounts.  Applicant  has  a
favorable credit history with all but the four accounts alleged in the SOR being reported
as “pays as agreed.” (Tr. 132, 136, 153, 173; GE 3- GE 4; AE C, F)
