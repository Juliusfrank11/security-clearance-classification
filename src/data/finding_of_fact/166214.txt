Applicant is a 34-year-old senior administrative assistant for a defense contractor
who seeks a security clearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted
as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant  married  in  2009  and  has  two  children,  one  from  this  marriage  and
another  from  a  prior  relationship.  (GE  1;  Tr.  4)  She  earned  a  high  school  diploma  in
2005  and  an  associate’s degree  in  December 2013.  (GE 1; Tr.  40) Applicant reported
no mitary service.  (GE 1)
Since  October 2018, Applicant  has  been  employed  by  her current employer. (GE
1)   Between   October  2016   and   November  2018,   she   was  employed   by   a   non-defense
contractor  as  a   senior  administrative   assistant.   (GE   1;  Tr.  40-41)  She   reported
unemployment for a  brief  six-month  period  in 2016. (GE  1)  She  has never possessed  a
security clearance.  (GE 1)
Applicant’s finances
Between  2013  and  2019,  Applicant  accumulated  three  delinquent  student  loan
debts  exceeding  $8,800  and  delinquent  medical  and  consumer  debts  exceeding
$25,000. (GEs 2-5) In her post-hearing submissions (AEs B-C) she supplied a payment
history  of  small  payments  made  toward  her  matured  student  loans.  Because  these
small  payments  were  not  considered  by  her  student  loan  lender,  the  Department  of
Education (DoE) to prevent her loans from being in default, they were placed  in a DoE
default category. (AE C)
After crediting two voluntary payments (of $181 each) made in March 2019 and
May  2019,  respectively,  and  a  U.S.  Treasury  offset  from  Applicant’s  tax  refund
entitlement (in the amount of $838) made in February 2019 to Applicant’s student loan
arrearage, the DoE was able to move Applicant’s delinquent student loan accounts over
to the lender’s rehabilitation category. (AE C) Further payment progress by Applicant on
her student loan obligations is unclear. Since her last reported payments on her student
loans in 2019, she hasn’t provided any payment updates.
Besides  her  delinquent  student  loans,  Applicant  accumulated  number  of
delinquent  medical  and  consumer  debts  (11  in  all,  exceeding  $25,000).  (GEs  2-6)  To
date, she has provided no documentation of her addressing any of these accounts with
payments,  payment  plans,  or  successful  disputing  of  any  of  the  listed  SOR  debts.
Afforded additional post-hearing opportunities to document her payment and resolution
efforts,  Applicant  failed  to  do  so.  While  six  of  the  listed  debts  in  the  SOR  have  since
been  removed  from  her  credit  reports  (e.g.,  SOR  debts  covered  by  ¶¶1.f-1.j),  their
removal  alone  does  not  supply  the  needed  proof  of  her  resolving  them  by  good-faith,
voluntary means.
Allegations  that  Applicant  failed  to  file,  as  required,  an  federal  income
(unemployment  income)  tax  return  for  tax  year  2017  are  successfully  challenged  by
Applicant. The pertinent tax year for reporting her unemployment income was 2016, and
not  2017,  based  on  the  unemployment  information  she  provided  in  her  electronic
questionnaires for investigations processing (e-QIP) Applicant documented her filing her
2016 federal tax return in March 2017, as required. Applicant, in turn, was  credited by
the IRS with reporting her 2016 unemployment income for that year in her filed federal
income  tax  return.  (AE  B)  State  income  tax  returns  are  not  required  in  her  state  of
residence. (Tr.. 69-70)
Addressing  her  financial  resources  currently  available  to  her,  Applicant  earns
$52,000  annually  and  nets  $700  bi-weekly.  (Tr.  65-66)  She  could  not  estimate  her
husband’s annual salary (Tr. 67) She estimated to have a small monthly remainder after
paying her monthly bills. (Tr. 68)  Applicant keeps track of her own bills every month but
does  not  maintain  a  written  budget.  (Tr.  70)  She  has  not  pursued  any  financial
counseling.
