In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d,
1.f, 1.h, and denied ¶¶ 1.e and 1.g with explanations. (Answer, Item 3) Applicant, age 46,
is not married and has one minor son. (Item 1) He obtained his undergraduate degree in
1998, his real estate license in 2004, and his master’s degree in 2004. He is the owner of
two private businesses, a consulting company from 2010 and a real estate company from
April, 2021. (AE M, N) Applicant completed his security clearance application on August
5, 2018. (Item 4) He has held a security clearance since 2008. (Item 1) He has been with
his current employer since July 2018. (Item 4)
FINANCIAL
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  delinquent  debt  totaling  $98,636,  including
four consumer accounts, two medical accounts, and a significant past-due child support
arrearage. (Item 6) The SOR further alleged that Applicant failed to file his 2017 Federal
income tax return. (Item 1)
Applicant admitted the majority of the allegations, but he denied the two medical
debts on the basis that he did not recognize them. He attributes the delinquent debts to
a period of unemployment, from March to December 2017. In addition, a contractor  was
stealing from his real estate business, resulting in significant unplanned costs. (Items 3
and  4)  He  also  cited  several  additional  circumstances  that  negatively  impacted  his
finances, including incurring legal expenses related to a child custody dispute and travel
costs between states to visit his son. He claims that he began addressing his debts shortly
after  he  regained  employment  in  December  2017  and  now,  three  years  later  he  has
resolved all but his child support arrearage. (Item 3) He is a poor historian of his financial
history  due  to  several  inconsistencies  in  his  answer  to  the  SOR  and  his  response  to
FORM.
As to the issue of unemployment, he disputes the information written in the FORM
that he voluntarily left his job in March 2017. (Item 4, AE V)) Applicant’s response to the
form stated that he inaccurately listed his reason for leaving his employment in his August
15, 2018, SF86. He now states that he was an employee from 2013 until February 2017,
not a contractor. He states that the understanding was for him  to work from home and
visit work sites in various states for four days a week. He stated that when the contract
ended, this arrangement was no longer possible. He did not want to move from his home
state. So, he declined the position and offered he was terminated. He declared there was
no severance package. (Response to FORM, (AE V)
However, he was not without any income  and financial resources. He disclosed
that he started his own company and had real estate interests as early as 2013. At the
time,  he  owned  sixteen  properties.  Applicant  stated  that  he  had  some  losses  and  in
January 2017, he invested $100,000 in an apartment complex. He stated that there was
theft  of  property  by  the  management  company,  but  provided  no  proof.  He  admits  that
initially he focused on paying the mortgages and other expenses on his rental properties.
Applicant also had consistent work as a contract employee. He has been employed on a
full-time basis since December 2017. He took trips abroad for tourism from 2011-2017.
(Item 4)
In his answer to the FORM, Applicant stated that he began paying delinquent debts
as early as January 2019 with a $37,581 payment to have his mortgage reinstated and a
payment of $1,236 in April 2019, to pay another account. He did not address his child
support arrears. (AE V)
As to SOR allegation ¶ 1.a, an account that is past-due for child support arrears in
the approximate amount of $43,235, Applicant admitted the allegation, but claimed that
he was unable to provide child support from September 2017 to April 2019 due to financial
losses  and  insufficient  income.  He  provided  proof  that  he  paid  from  February  2006,
usually  in  the  amount  of  $1,000,  until  September  24,  2019.  However,  some  of  the
amounts  were  much  less.  (AE  A)  The  child  custody  issue  is  contentious.  (Item  9)
Applicant provided various court orders, including a temporary one, granting him custody
in  2019  and  allowing  him  to  stop  child  support.  (AE  B,  C)  In  2017,  after  he  was
unemployed,  he  was  ordered  by  a  court  to  resume  child- support  payments  and  pay
$12,000 in child support arrears for a seven-month period (October 2016 to April 2017.
He stated that he was unable to continue paying the arrearages due to insufficient income.
The mother of the child was ordered to pay some support but Applicant claims she has
not. (AE D) Applicant is now awaiting a final order awarding him full custody. However,
he  was  confirmed  in  arrears  in  2020  in  a  court  order  in  the  amount  of  $44,261,  with
interest. He projects that he will pay $700 a month and the arrearage will be reduced to
$32,000. Applicant at one point stated that his attorney advised him to stop child support
payments. He submitted a draft, unsigned order. (AE E). The support arrearage at this
time is unresolved. (Item 3)
As to SOR ¶ 1.b the SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted for a charged-off credit
card in the approximate amount of $22,155. The card was charged off in June 2019. (Item
6,  7)  Applicant  contacted  the  collection  agency  on  or  about  October  27,  2020,  and
arranged to settle the debt for $10,000, which was paid on November 2, 2020. (AE F) In
his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  presented  a  power  of  attorney  document  limited  to  credit
counseling.  However,  there  is nothing  in  the  record  to  show that  he  received  financial
counseling.
As  to   SOR   ¶   1.c,  the   SOR  alleged   that  Applicant  was  indebted   for  a   collection
account in the  approximate  account of  $11,515. The  debt was for a  2017  car loan. (Item
6)  He stated  that the  new  car had  constant  repairs  since  he  purchased  it  and  it  required
more  in  April 2018.  (AE  G) After  negotiation, he  voluntarily  surrendered  the  car  and  it was
sold at  auction. There was a  deficiency  balance  of $11,515. Applicant settled the  debt in
November 2020  for an unknown amount.  (AE  H)
As  to  SOR  ¶  1.d,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  an  account  placed  in
collection in 2018 in the approximate amount of $9,657. He explained it was a credit card
used for real estate repairs. He could not pay after his unemployment. A default judgment
was obtained against him in 2020 for $9,657. (Item 10) He settled the debt for an unknown
amount in September 2020. (Item 3, AE I)
As to SOR ¶ 1.e, the SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted to a creditor identified
as a medical account on his credit report, date April 7, 2020, Applicant denied this debt
because he was not familiar with or liable for the account. He engaged a financial services
firm and was advised to contact the creditor to validate the debt. He claims he called the
creditor and the debt was not validated. It was removed from his credit report. He has no
documentation for this claim.
As  to   SOR  ¶   1.f,   the   SOR  alleged   that  Applicant  is  indebted   to   a   charged-off
account  in   the   amount   of  $5,449,   which  was  a   credit   card   used   for   real estate   repairs
which  became  delinquent in 2018  and  was charged  off  in March 2019. (Item  8) Applicant
contacted  the  agency  in October 2020  and  settled  the  debt for $2,179.98. It  was  paid on
November 3, 2020. (Item 3, AEJ)
As  to  SOR  ¶  1.g,  Applicant  was  indebted  to  a  creditor  identified  as  a  medical
account,  dated  April  2020,  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $109.  Applicant  denied  this
allegation. He claims that there was one credit report that had the account listed, but no
identifying information for the original creditor. He has been unable to discover any other
information about this alleged debt.  (Answer to SOR)
As to  SOR ¶  1.h, the  SOR alleged  that Applicant failed  to  file, as required, Federal
income   tax   returns  for   at  least   tax   year  2017.   Applicant  admitted   and   denied   this
allegation. He  failed  to  file  his 2017  federal tax  return because  of complicated  business
losses,  his poor bookkeeping  and  negligence  to  file.  It  was filed  in  February  2020. (Item
3) The  filing  occurred  long  after his security  clearance  process began. It  also appears that
Applicant carries an outstanding Federal tax balance  for prior years. (Item  3)
Applicant explained that normally his CPA completes his tax return, but in 2017,
Applicant  decided  to  do  the  bookkeeping.  He  noted  that  he  did  a  poor  job.  His  CPA
needed an extension to file the 2017 federal income tax return  because  Applicant failed
to provide the CPA with the required forms and documentation. The tax return was filed
in February 2020. (Item 3, AE K) Ultimately, he claimed he was owed a refund.
Applicant  completed  a  personal financial  statement  on  December  18,  2020.  He
reports a net monthly income of $22,146 and other income from his realty company of
$6,822.  (AE  O)  His  monthly expenses  are  $7,650.  His  debts  include  the  child  support
arrears with his actual monthly amount listed as zero. He is paying other mortgages. His
monthly net remainder is $10,899. Applicant lists his total assets as $2,190,000.
Applicant presented letters of recommendation from college friends, colleagues,
and a member of a board of trustees for child protection. Some of the references have
known  Applicant  for  more  than  20  years.  Each  letter  attests  to  his  diligence,  ethics,
integrity, and diligence in his professional and personal life. (AE P-U)
Applicant settled the SOR debts, with the exception of the child-support arrears, in
2020, after the SOR was issued. The delinquent accounts were from 2018 and 2019. He
changed some of his responses after the FORM was issued in February 2021.
