Through his explanations, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b
(in part), 1.c, 1.d, 1.e (in part), and 1.f. The portions of the allegations that Applicant did
not clearly admit, I consider that he denied. In answering the Amendment to the SOR,
Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 2.a and denied SOR ¶¶ 2.b and 2.c, again with explanations.
His  admissions  and  explanations  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 63 years old. Both he and his wife were born, raised, and educated
in  the  former  Soviet  Union,  in  a  Siberian  city,  in  what  is  now  Russia.  They  married  in
1979.  (GE  1  at  26)  Applicant  earned  a  master’s  degree  in  1980  (age  22)  and  a
doctorate in 1983 (age 25) at a prestigious university or academic institution in Siberia.
(GE 1 at 13; Tr. 36-37, 40, 76-77) He has published three books in his field and many
professional and scientific articles. Three times, he was named the best scientist at the
Siberian  academy  or  institute  where  he  worked  until  coming  to  the  United  States.  (Tr.
36-37)
Applicant  and  his  wife  have  three  grown  children  (and  another  son,  who  is
deceased). (Tr. 93) Applicant and his family came to the United States in 1999 when he
was granted entry under an H1B Visa. (Tr. 79-80) Applicant became a naturalized U.S.
citizen in August 2008. (GE 1 at 10)
From 2005 to 2011, Applicant worked for a large defense contractor as a senior
software engineer. He worked for most of 2012 with a large insurance company. From
2013 to early 2016, he was employed by federal contractors. (GE 1 at 18-21) Between
early 2016 and mid-2018, he worked either for federal contractors or independently as a
consultant.  Since  July  2018,  he  has  worked  as  a  cyber-security  specialist  or  software
developer for a federal contractor. (GE 1 at 14-17; GE 2 at 12; Tr. 33, 70-75)
Applicant was granted eligibility for a position of public trust in June 2013 for work
as  a  contractor  with  the  another  government  agency.  He  was  also  granted  a  secret
clearance in October 2016 for similar work with  another government agency. (GE 1 at
55; 2 at 11; Tr. 14, 19, 49, 72)
Applicant and his wife own their home in the United States. (AE B, AE C) He has
a  six-figure  annual salary and  a  net  worth  estimated  in  the mid-six figures.  (Tr. 75-76,
120-121; GE 2 at 8. In Russia, Applicant’s wife worked as a geophysicist. As such, like
Applicant, she was a government employee. She is now a housewife and grandmother.
(GE 2 at 13; Tr. 91-92, 164-165)
Applicant and  his wife  are both  dual U.S.-Russian  citizens. (GE 1  at 25, GE  2  at
13) (SOR ¶¶  1.a, 1.f) They  both  hold valid  Russian  passports. (GE 2  at 13) He declared
on   his SCA  that  “I  want  to   remain   Russian.”   (GE  1   at  9) In   his background   interviews
and   in  his  hearing   testimony,  he   stated   that  he   declined   to   relinquish  his  Russian
citizenship  because   it  is  extremely   difficult  to   do   so,  and   because   keeping   a   Russian
passport allows for easier travel to  Russia  without the  need  for a  visa. (GE 2  at 13, 15;
Tr. 32-36) His parents  and  a  son  are buried  in Russia,  and  he  wants to  be  able to  visit
their gravesites. (GE 2  at 12; Tr. 195)
Applicant testified  that he  uses a  Russian  passport only  to  enter Russia.  He uses
his U.S.   passport   when   he  exits  Russia. When  entering   and  exiting   the   United   States,
he  said he  shows both  passports so  as  to  be  fully  transparent  with  U.S. authorities. He
anticipates that he  will renew  his Russian passport when  it expires in 2025. (Tr. 35,  116-
117)
Applicant  noted   in  his  background   interview   that  he   has  dual  loyalty   and
allegiance,  to   both   Russia  and   the   United   States.   (GE  2   at  13)   He   said   if   the   United
States  and  Russia were to  enter into  conflict,  he  would not  fight for either side.  (GE  2  at
17) He later said if there were a  conflict,  he  would fight against  the  people  causing  the
conflict,   no   matter  who   they   were.  He  said  he   feels  allegiance   to   both   countries,  and
also said he  has no  preference  for either the  U.S. or the  Russian  government.  (GE 2  at
18) This “dual allegiance”  is alleged  in the  SOR as a  personal conduct security  concern.
(SOR ¶ 2.a)
Applicant  testified  that  he  participated  in  compulsory  military  training  while  in
university,  but  never  served  in  either  the  Soviet  or  Russian  military.  (Tr.  77)  When  he
worked  in  Russia  as  a  mathematician  and  scientist,  he  was  considered  a  government
employee.  (Tr.  78)  (Later  in  his  testimony,  he  disputed  that  the  academy  where  he
worked  was  a  government  institution;  he  said  it  was  “independent.”)  (Tr.  195)  He  was
never involved in political organizations or the Communist Party. “All my heart is here,”
he  said.  All  of  his  family  are  in  the  U.S.  but  for  his  father-in-law.  (Tr.  33,  67)  He
reiterated these sentiments in closing, and said he would never “be  a  spy against  [his]
grandkids” from  here  (the  United  States.  (Tr.  194-195)  He  is proud  of  his professional
recognition in Russia, but he said, “I came here to make this country better.” (Tr. 195)
Applicant’s three grown children, all born in the 1980s, now live in the U.S., near
Applicant and his wife, and are all naturalized U.S. citizens. (GE 1 at 28-31; GE 2 at 13;
Tr. 66) One son is an engineer; another son works in investments; and their daughter is
a housewife, married to an American. Their daughter has two young children, both born
in the United States. (Tr. 65-67, 93, GE 2 at 16)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  that  all  three  of  Applicant’s  children  are  dual  U.S.-Russian
citizens. In his SOR Answer, Applicant said only his daughter is a dual citizen. His two
sons have lived in the U.S. for 20 years,  have not had active Russian passports since
2012, and have not travelled to Russia for several years before then. (Answer; Tr. 65).
His  daughter  travelled  to  Russia  once  for  medical  treatment  a  few years  ago.  (Tr. 66)
There  is  no  indication  that  Applicant’s  two  sons  have  renounced  their  Russian
citizenship (something which Applicant testified is very difficult to do).
Applicant’s parents are deceased, as is his mother-in-law. (GE 1 at 27-28, 33) He
has one sister, who lives in Germany. (Tr. 108, GE 2 at 6)
Applicant’s  father-in-law,  age  89,  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Russia.  (Tr.  93)
(SOR  ¶  1.c)  He  is  a  retired  scientist  and  engineer.  As  such,  he  was  considered  a
government  employee.  His  father-in-law  is  blind,  an  invalid  and  has  been  in  a  nursing
home  since  June  2020.  He  was  moved  there  with  the  help  of  a  neighbor,  A,  and  a
daughter from his second marriage. (GE 2 at 14-16; Tr. 96-97, 149, 166-168))
Applicant and his wife see her father in person when they visit Russia. (GE 1 at
31-32; Tr. 95) He rarely speaks to his father-in-law by phone, but his wife speaks to her
father briefly about once a week. (GE 2 at 15; Tr. 95, 149-151) She is very close to her
father. She helped care for him and her brother after her mother died after a long illness
when  Applicant’s wife  was a teenager. (Tr. 151-152) Applicant’s wife  provides financial
support to her father, as discussed below. His wife’s father has four children from  later
marriages.  Applicant’s  wife  has  little  contact  with  them  because  of  the  age  difference.
(Tr. 167-170) They are not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant’s brother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Russia. He lives in Siberia.
He is a scientist and Russian government employee. Applicant has no contact with him.
(Tr. 109) He was not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant  and  his  wife  travelled  to  Russia  for  vacations  and  family  visits  in  the
summers of 2009, 2015, 2017, and 2019. (GE 1 at 37, 46, 49; GE 2 at 9). Applicant has
not been back to Russia since July 2019. (Tr. 135)
While  studying  and  working  at  the  institute  in  Siberia,  Applicant  and  his  family
lived for several years in a dormitory. In about 1995, because of his excellent work, he
was allowed to move to a small, university-owned apartment. The apartment was only a
few  hundred  square  feet.  (Answer;  Tr.  36-37,  78-79;  AE  A)  Applicant  and  his  family
were  granted  ownership  of  the  apartment  through  privatization  of  state  property  in  the
mid-1990s,  after  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union.  They  were  granted  ownership  but
could not sell it. (Tr. 152-153; AE A)
They maintained ownership of the unit after they emigrated to the United States,
and continue to own the unit now. The apartment is owned jointly by Applicant, his wife,
and their children (not solely by his wife, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d). The alleged value of
the unit (about $30,000 US) is noted in the record (GE 2 at 12; Tr. 80) but the true value
is not documented. Applicant and his wife have had renters in the past, and they used
the rental income (of about $250 a month, as alleged) to support Applicant’s father. (GE
2  at 13) The unit  is currently vacant,  because  of the pandemic.  (Answer; Tr.  68) They
last  had  renters  about  a  year  ago.  (Tr.  81)  Applicant  had  no  direct  contact  with  any
renters. (GE 2 at 17; Tr. 63-64, 81-82)
Applicant indicated during his background interview that he may want to keep the
apartment and live there in retirement, in part, he said, because it is expensive to retire
in the United States. (See GE 2 at 17-18) Applicant declined at hearing to confirm this
as  he  made  that  statement  during  his  background  interview  (though  he  adopted  the
interview  summaries  in  GE  2  as  accurate  without  making  changes).  Regarding  his
present intent, he testified that he has not decided where to retire. (Tr. 84-91)
Applicant noted that he has to pay taxes and utilities (energy and water)  for the
Russian  apartment  “even  if  we  don’t  use  it.”  (Tr.  62-63)  He  said  his  wife  is  more
involved  with  that  process  than  he  is.  (Tr.  83-84)  He  also  stated  that  he  and  his  wife
stay  at  the  apartment  when  they  visit  Russia.  (Tr.  80,  84,  112-116)  Applicant
acknowledged that he still owned the property, still used it, and was technically allowed
to sell it. (Tr. 132) However, he said that selling the unit is difficult, as it would require all
of the family members to travel to Russia, and his children do not want to do that. (Tr.
37-42, 153-155) Applicant said the apartment is in disrepair. He would like to “get rid of
it.”  (Tr.  37-38)  In  a  post-hearing  letter,  Applicant  expressed  a  willingness  to  relinquish
his ownership of the apartment to his granddaughter. (AE H)
Both Applicant and his wife were born in 1958. When his wife turned 55 (in 2013)
and  when  he  turned  60  (in  2018),  they  both  became  eligible  to  receive  a  monthly
financial  benefit  from  the  Russian  government.  She  did  not  learn  of  her  eligibility  until
later. (Tr. 159-163) Applicant’s wife  said  she  has been receiving the benefit money for
about five years. (Tr. 175)
The  amount  of  the  benefits  Applicant  and  his  wife  both  receive  is  equivalent  to
about  $120  US  per  month  (not  $200  per  month,  as  alleged).  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d,  1.e)  The
benefit is available to any Russian citizen and does not appear to be based on the fact
that both Applicant and his wife are former Russian government employees. At various
times,  Applicant  described  the  benefit  as  a  “pension,”  (GE  2)  and  at  other  times  he
disputed that term. (Tr. 60, 63) Regardless, the money seems to be the equivalent of a
social  security  payment  or  benefit  from  the  Russian  government,  available  to  Russian
citizens above a certain age.
Applicant’s  wife   uses  her   monthly   benefit   to   support  her  elderly   father.  (SOR  ¶
1.e)   She   uses  the   money   for  her  father’s  medical  care,  which  costs  the   equivalent  of
about $500  US  per  month. (Tr. 46-47,  117) She  noted  that her father, being  in  his 80s,
also receives a  financial benefit from  the  Russian  government,  and  that  money, too, is
used  for his nursing care. (Tr. 156-159)
The primary caregiver for Applicant’s father-in-law is a neighbor, A, who is herself
retired  and  in  her  80s.  A  is  a  long-time,  trusted  acquaintance  of  the  family.  Applicant
and  his  wife  have  given  A  authority  to  withdraw  funds  from  his  wife’s  Russian  bank
account  (like  a  power  of  attorney)  for  the  father’s  care.  A  also  manages  Applicant’s
apartment  in  Siberia  and  sees  to  it  that  the  taxes  and  utility  bills  are  paid.  (Tr.  82-83,
143-144, 172-173) Applicant has contact with A about once a year. However, Applicant
and  his wife  are  “very  close”  to A. A is retired from a job as a technician at a Russian
academic institute. (Tr. 110-111) Other than A and his father-in-law, Applicant maintains
contact with no other Russian citizens. (Tr. 108)
Applicant’s $120 monthly benefit is deposited into an account at Russian Bank S
set up for that purpose. (GE 2 at 7, 16) (SOR ¶ 1.e) Applicant has never withdrawn the
money, which accumulates in that account. (Tr. 45. 117, 159, AE E) He said that for him
to do so, he would have to travel to Russia, which would cost more money than is in the
account.  (Tr.  42-43,  80,  104)  He  said  he  was  not  contacted  about  the  account,  but  it
was widely publicized in the media when the benefit system was established. (Tr. 105)
He  has  taken  no  active  steps  to  close  the  Russian  bank  account  or  to  renounce  the
pension.  (Tr.  105-107)  After  the  hearing,  Applicant  provided  a  letter  for  the  record
indicating  that  the  account  contains  the  equivalent  of  $3,419  US.  He  is  willing  to
relinquish ownership of it and transfer it to his wife. (AE I)
When  he  submitted  his  August  2018  SCA,  Applicant  did  not  disclose  the
apartment in Russia, the Russian bank accounts, or the benefits he and his wife receive
from the Russian government. These omissions are alleged as deliberate falsifications
under Guideline E (SOR ¶¶ 2.b, 2.c)
Section 20A of Applicant’s August 2018 SCA (Foreign Financial Interests – Real
legally  recognized  domestic  civil
Estate)  asks,  “Have  you,  your  spouse,  or
union/domestic  partner,  cohabitant,  or  dependent  children  EVER  owed,  or  do  you
anticipate  owning,  or  plan  to  purchase  real  estate  in  a  foreign  country?”  Applicant
answered “No.” (GE 1 at 34)
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose that his wife owns
an  apartment  in  Russia  and  receives  about  $250  in  monthly  rental  income  from  it  (as
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d). Applicant denied SOR ¶ 2.b, asserting that he had answered the
question correctly on his SCA because he was receiving no financial benefit or rent at
that time, and also because he was not able to sell it. (Answer, Tr. 64)
At his hearing, Applicant asserted that he misunderstood the question because it
was not stated clearly. (Tr. 62, 139-140) He stated he did not want to lie and intended to
be truthful. (Tr. 140) He asserted that the question asked about property being used for
“commercial  purposes.”  (Tr.  62)  (The  question  does  not  actually  refer  to  “commercial
purposes.) (GE 1 at 34) Applicant also testified that he  answered  “no” because  he  did
not pay attention to the full question on the SCA, and focused more on the portion of the
question asking about plans to purchase real estate in the future. (Tr. 124-126)
Section  20A  of  Applicant’s  August  2018  SCA  (Foreign  Financial  Interests  –
Foreign Benefit) asks, “As a  U.S.  citizen, have  you,  your spouse, or legally recognized
domestic civil union/domestic partner, cohabitant, or dependent children received in the
last  seven  (7)  years,  or  are  eligible  to  receive  in  the  future,  any  educational,  medical,
retirement,  social  welfare,  or  other  such  benefit  from  a  foreign  country?”  Applicant
answered “No.” (GE at 34)
SOR  ¶  2.c  alleges  that  Applicant  deliberately  failed  to  disclose  that  he  and  his
wife  receive  monthly  pensions  from  Russia  (SOR  ¶¶  1.e  and  1.f)  in  answer  to  that
question.  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  2.c.  He  stated  that,  he  learned  during  the  family’s
2017 trip to Russia that he may be eligible for a pension (since he was soon to turn 60).
He went to the pension office but they were not able to provide confirmation.  (Answer;
Tr.  99-103)  In  2019,  when  they  again  visited  Russia,  Applicant  learned  that  he  was
eligible and that the equivalent of  about $100 a month in benefits  had been deposited
into  an  account at  Russian  bank  S, beginning on  May 15,  2018.  However, he  said  he
did  not  know  about  the  deposits  when  he  prepared  his  SCA  in  August  2018,  so  his
answer was truthful. (Answer) (Tr. 50-61; AE E) Applicant testified that he learned from
his wife that she had money in  her Russian account that she was using for her father.
She then suggested that he might have an account as well. (Tr. 141)
Applicant’s wife  testified  that Applicant  was not aware that the money had been
deposited  into  the  account until 2019,  because  “we  had  no  connection  to  it.” (Tr. 162)
She also said they went to the bank in 2017, before he turned 60. (Tr. 176)
Applicant’s first background  interview  occurred  in November 2018.  He reviewed
his  SCA  with  the  interviewing  agent,  and  discussed  his  family  members,  including  his
father-in-law,  his  employment  history  and  his  dual  citizenship.  He  also  discussed  the
apartment in Russia, and the fact that his wife had used the rental income from the unit
to  support her father-in-law.  There  was  no  discussion  of  the  issue  of  monthly benefits
from the Russian government. (GE 2 at 11-13)
Applicant  testified  that  he  did  not  learn  about  the  bank  account  in  Russia  until
2019. (Tr. 45, 117) He testified, “I don’t care about this pension,” and “I never saw these
statements before I arrived [in] Russia in August 2019.” (Tr. 136-137, 141-142) He and
his wife travelled to Russia in July and August 2019. (GE 2 at 9) Yet he discussed the
bank  accounts  and  the  financial  benefits  in  his  second  background  interview,  which
occurred in June 2019, before that trip. (GE 2 at 14)
During  that  June  2019  interview,  Applicant  disclosed  both  his  and  his  wife’s
Russian bank accounts, and the fact that they both received monthly benefits from the
Russian   government.  He  also  disclosed   that   his   wife   used   her  monthly   benefits   to
support her father. (GE  2  at 16)  He said in the  interview  that he  did  not list the  accounts
because  of the  small  amounts of  money  involved. (GE 2  at  16)  He  testified  that he  did
not  hide   the   apartment  or  the   money   that  had   accumulated   in  the   accounts.   (Tr.  140,
142) He disclosed  the  assets during  his interview  when  he  was asked  about  them. (Tr.
143)
Applicant’s  discussion  of  the  accounts  and  the  benefits  during  his  second
interview calls into question the veracity of his testimony and explanation in his Answer
that he learned of the accounts and the deposits during his 2019 trip to Russia – since
that  trip  occurred  a  month  after his  second background  interview.  (Tr.  128-131)  At  his
hearing, Applicant acknowledged that he knew in 2017 that he might be eligible for such
benefits, when the pension office told him about them. (Tr. 127-128)
Section  20  of  Applicant’s  SCA  also  includes  a  question  asking,  “Have  you  ever
provided  financial  support  to  any  individual?”  Applicant  answered,  “No.”  (GE  1  at  34)
Applicant explained during his testimony that his answer was truthful because it was his
wife who provided financial support to her father, using her money. However, they also
used money collected as rental income from their jointly owned apartment in Russia. He
also said it was possible that his wife supported her father using money Applicant had
earned in the United States. (Tr. 133-135) Falsification of this question is not alleged in
the SOR.
Applicant  testified  that he  loves  his job and his work and  has  provided  value  to
his  federal  agency.  (Tr.  47-48)  He  testified  that  he  is  an  honest  man,  not  involved  in
politics, doing good work that improves or provides value to his job. Loss of his job will
damage his family. He does not intend to switch jobs at his age, and expects to retire in
three to five years. (Tr. 69, 74)
Applicant’s wife testified that her husband is “the most hard-working person.” He
is very knowledgeable and effective at work. His company appreciates him and the help
he provides them. (Tr. 183-184)
Five co-workers of Applicant’s, including a supervisor, provided recommendation
letters  attesting  to  his  character.  He  has  excellent  professional  skills  and  is  very
knowledgeable. He is well respected and appreciated. He has an excellent work ethic.
He is mission-oriented, reliable, and responsible. (AE F) Two long-time personal friends
of  Applicant’s  provided  reference  letters.  They  both  regard  Applicant  as  reliable,
responsible, honest, and compassionate. (AE G)
Russia
The  Russian  Federation  has  a  highly  centralized,  authoritarian  political  system
dominated by President Vladimir Putin. (AN Item I) The Office of the Director of National
Intelligence  (ODNI)  has  determined  that  Russia  is  a  highly  capable  and  effective
adversary,  integrating  ongoing  cyber-espionage,  attack,  and  influence  operations  to
achieve  its political and  military  objectives. The  ODNI expects that Russia’s intelligence
services  will continue  to  target the  United  States, seeking  to  collect intelligence, erode
U.S.  democracy,  undermine   U.S.  national   policies  and   foreign   relationships,   and
increase Russia’s global position and influence.  (AN Item II)
The  administrative  notice  filing  and  supporting  documents  detail  numerous
Russian  intelligence  operations  in and against  the United  States  since  2017  that have
led  to  federal  criminal  indictments  against  Russian  intelligence  operatives.  (AN  Filing
at4-7)
In  its  2018  Foreign  Economic  Espionage  in  Cyberspace  Report,  the  National
Counterintelligence and Security Center reported that Russia uses cyber operations as
an  instrument  of  intelligence  collection  to  inform  its  decision-making  and  benefit  its
economic
intelligence  services  have  conducted
sophisticated and large-scale hacking operations to collect sensitive U.S. business and
technology information. (AN Item VII)
interests,  and
that  Russian
The  ODNI  has  reported  that  Russian  efforts  to  influence  the  2016  U.S.
presidential election demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity,
and scope of effort compared to previous operations.  The ODNI assessed that Russia
would again attempt to influence the 2020 U.S. elections.  Russia’s persistent objective
is to weaken the United States and diminish its global role. (AN Items IV and V)
The  United  States  imposes  sanctions  on  Russian  persons  and  entities  in
response  to  Russian  conduct,  including  its  illegal  annexation  of  Crimea,  invasion  of
eastern  Ukraine,  election  interference,  malicious  cyber-enabled  activities,  and  human
rights abuses. (AN Item XX)
According   to   the   U.S.  State   Department’s  website,  the   State   Department’s
current  Travel  Advisory   for  Russia   is  Level  4:  Do   Not   Travel,  due   to   COVID-19   and
related   entry   restrictions,  terrorism,   harassment  by   Russian   government  security
officials,  the   U.S.  Embassy’s  limited   ability   to   assist   U.S.   citizens  in  Russia,   and   the
arbitrary enforcement of local law. The current travel advisory, dated November 2, 2021,
is  substantially   similar   to   AN  Item   XXI,   the   State   Department’s  Travel  Advisory  for
Russia  from August 2020.
U.S.  citizens,  including   former  and   current  U.S.  government   and   military
personnel  and   private   citizens  engaged   in   business,  who   are  visiting   or  residing   in
Russia  have  been  interrogated  without cause,  threatened  by  Russian  officials,  and  may
become   victims  of   harassment,   mistreatment,   and   extortion.  All   U.S.  government
personnel should carefully consider their need to  travel to Russia.  (AN Item XXI)
Russian  security  services  have  arrested  U.S.  citizens  on  spurious  charges,
denied  them  fair  and  transparent  treatment,  and  have  convicted  them  in  secret  trials
without  presenting  evidence.  Russian  officials  may  unreasonably  delay  U.S.  consular
assistance  to  detained  U.S.  citizens.  Russian  authorities  arbitrarily  enforce  local  laws
10
against   U.S.  citizen   religious  workers  and   open   questionable  criminal  investigations
against  such  individuals. Russian  security  services are increasingly arbitrarily  enforcing
local laws targeting  foreign  and  international organizations they  consider “undesirable,”
and   U.S.  citizens  should  avoid  travel  to   Russia   to   perform   work  for  or  volunteer  with
non-governmental organizations.  (AN Item XXI)
Russia  enforces  special  restrictions  on  dual  U.S.-Russian  nationals  and  may
refuse to acknowledge dual nationals’ U.S. citizenship, including denying access to U.S.
consular assistance and preventing their departure from Russia. (AN Item XXI)
Terrorist  groups,  transnational  and  local  terrorist  organizations,  and  individuals
inspired  by  extremist  ideology  continue  plotting  possible  attacks  in  Russia.  Terrorists
may  attack  with  little  or  no  warning,  targeting  tourist  locations,  transportation  hubs,
markets,  shopping  malls,  local  government  facilities,  hotels,  clubs,  restaurants,  places
of  worship,  parks, major sporting and  cultural events,  educational institutions,  airports,
and other public areas. (AN Item XXI)
Telephone and electronic communications in Russia are subject to surveillance,
which  can  potentially  compromise  sensitive  information.  The  Russian  System  for
Operational-Investigative  Activities  permits  authorities  to  monitor  and  record  all  data
lawfully that traverses Russia’s networks. (AN Item XXIII)
