Applicant  admitted  some  of  the  SOR  allegations,  with  explanations  (SOR  1.a,
1.c, 1.d, 2.a, and 3.a), and he denied others (SOR 1.b and 3.a-3.c). His admissions are
incorporated  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review of  the  pleadings  and  evidence,  I  make
the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  49-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  has  worked  for
this employer since November 2017. He is a high school graduate. He married in 1996
and  divorced  in  2012.  He  has  three  children  from  this marriage,  ages  24,  20,  and  14.
(Tr. at 5, 20, 26-27; GE 1)
The SOR alleged, under Guidelines J and G, that Applicant was involved in four
alcohol-related  arrests  between  2002  and  2019  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.d,  2.a).  The  SOR  also
alleged, under Guideline E, that he falsified his August 2019  Electronic Questionnaires
for  Investigation  Processing  (e-QIP)  when  he  failed  to  list  his  previous  arrests  as
required  by  the  questions  (SOR  ¶¶  3.a-3.b).  The  criminal  conduct  was  also
multiplicitously  pleaded  in  SOR  ¶  3.c.  The  allegations  are  supported  by  a  September
2019 federal arrest report, statements to a defense investigator during his background
investigation in October 2019, admissions he made in his answers to interrogatories in
May 2020, and his December 2020 SOR answer. (GE 2-4; SOR Answer)
Applicant described his alcohol history as beginning when he was either 18 or 19
years  old.  He  increased  his  amount  of  consumption  in  approximately  1996  after  he
married.  When  he  was  approximately  26  years  old  he  abstained  from  alcohol  use  for
religious reasons. This lasted until he was 30 years old. (Tr. at 27-29)
The four alcohol incidents are described below:
2002   Driving  Under  the   Influence   (DUI)  arrest.   Applicant  could  not  recall  the
details  of  this  arrest.  He  admitted  the  conduct  in  his  SOR  answer.  (Tr.  at  33;  GE  2-3;
SOR answer)
2011   Disorderly   Conduct;   Intoxication  by   Alcohol  or  Drugs;  DUI   arrest.
Applicant could not recall the details of this arrest.  He believed he received a ticket for
disorderly  conduct.  He  denied  the  conduct  in  his  SOR  answer.  A  federal  arrest  report
describes  the  arrest  and  it  appears  that  only  the  disorderly  conduct  and  intoxication
offenses went to court. (Tr. 40-41; GE 2, 4; SOR answer)
2014   DUI,   Driving  on  Suspended  License,  Failure   to   Appear,  and  other
related charges. Applicant described being stopped by law enforcement while having a
wine cooler in his car. A federal arrest report describes the arrest. (Tr. 40-41; GE 2, 4;
SOR answer)
2019   DUI.   Applicant  described  having  several  glasses  of  wine  and  bourbon
whiskey  at  a  friend’s house  in  June  2019. After  he  left  the  house,  he  was  stopped  by
law  enforcement  for  having  tinted  windows.  During  his  October  2019  interview  with  a
defense  investigator,  he  recalled  taking  a  breathalyzer  test,  which  showed  a  result  of
.08 percent blood alcohol. During his hearing testimony, he recalled that he declined the
breathalyzer  test.  He  admitted  committing  this  offense  in  his  SOR  answer.  He  was
convicted  and,  among  other  things,  he  was  sentenced  to  four  years’  probation.  He
remains on probation. (Tr. 37-39; GE 2-4; SOR answer)
Applicant  offered  a  progress  report  from  the  court  showing  he  had  completed
approximately 63 hours of  education and counseling sessions as of  October 2020. He
also  provided  a  compliance  form  showing  he  had  attended  a  victim-impact  panel  in
August  2020,  as  required  by  his  sentence.  He  has  not  participated  in  any  alcohol
treatment programs and he also does not participate in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He
claims  he  has  not  consumed  alcohol  since  his  June  2019  arrest.  He  claims  he  uses
meditation to control any urge to consume alcohol. (Tr. at 56-47; SOR answer)
Applicant listed his 2019 DUI arrest when he completed his SCA in August 2019.
He did not list the earlier alcohol-related offenses (2002, 2011, 2014). He testified that
he  was  under  pressure  to  complete  his  e-QIP  and  did  not  recall  the  earlier  incidents,
which is why he failed to list them. (Tr. at 23, 26, 33, 44-45; SOR answer)
