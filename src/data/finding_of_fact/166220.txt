Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  eligibility  for  access  to
classified  information  for  her  job as  a  senior systems  engineer for a  large  company in
the  defense  industry.  She  has  been  so  employed  since  July  2019.  (Exhibit  3)  Her
educational background includes a high school diploma awarded in 2001, an associate
degree in 2003, and a bachelor’s degree in December 2011. She has been married and
divorced more than once with the last divorce in 2011. (Exhibits 2 and 3)  She has two
minor children from the marriages.
Applicant’s  employment  history  includes  a  number  of  jobs  since  obtaining  her
bachelor’s degree  in 2011. In reverse chronological order, she worked as a consulting
engineer from August 2018 until July 2019, when she began his current job. Before that,
she  worked  as  a  cloud  administrator,  project  manager,  and  operations  manager  for
about two years during 2016-2018. Before that, she worked as a senior IT consultant for
less than a year during 2015-2016. Before that, she worked as a senior IT consultant for
about  two  years  during  2013-2015.  Before  that,  she  worked  as  a  remote  operations
manager  for  less  than  six  months  during  2013.  And  before  that,  she  worked  as  a  IT
manager for less than two years during 2011-2013.
Applicant’s  employment  history  also  includes  military  service.  She  is  an
honorably discharged veteran of the U.S. Army after about seven months on active duty
in 2008. She was separated before the end of her term of service due to a non-combat
related disability after she suffered stress fractures in both feet. (Answer; Exhibit 3)
The  SOR  alleges  a  history  of  financial  problems  consisting  of  a  Chapter  7
bankruptcy  case  discharged  in  2012,  and  11  delinquent  accounts  in  amounts  ranging
from $117 to $10,359 for a total of about $27,000. The delinquent accounts consist of a
deficiency balance after repossession of an automobile, a charged-off account, and nine
medical collection accounts. The bankruptcy is established by bankruptcy court records.
(Exhibit 6) The delinquent accounts are established by a  May 2019 credit report and a
March 2020 credit report. (Exhibits 4 and 5) All these matters are discussed below.
Applicant’s attributes the  Chapter 7  bankruptcy  case (SOR ¶ 1.l) to a divorce in
2011,  which  resulted  in  a  loss  of  household  income  and  she  was  unable  to  support
herself and her two children. (Exhibit 3) The bankruptcy case followed in 2012, with the
initial  filing  in  April  2012,  and  the  court  granting  her  a  discharge  in  September  2012.
(Exhibit 6) The discharged liabilities were 24 unsecured debts for about $26,000 in total.
The  second  largest  delinquency  in  the  SOR  is  a  deficiency  balance  of  $9,981
after  repossession  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.  The  March  2020  credit  report  describes  it  as  an
involuntary repossession with a current balance of $9,981. (Exhibit 5) In her answer to
the SOR, Applicant denied the allegation on the basis the account was paid in full and
presented  two  documents  in  support  thereof.  (Answer  at  Attachment  A)  The
documentation shows that a repossession of a 2008 Jeep occurred in December 2018,
and  the  vehicle  was  sold  at  auction  for  a  net  amount  of  $2,947.  In  the  June  2021
attorney letter, the attorney advises that Applicant elected to settle the case directly and
paid the debt in full resulting in satisfaction of a previously entered judgment. (Exhibit A)
Applicant did not provide documentary proof of payment or a copy of the satisfaction of
judgment. I find this account is unresolved.
The  largest  delinquency  is  a  $10,359  charged-off  account  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  The
March  2019  credit  report  describes  it  as  a  charged-off  installment  loan  (auto)  for
$10,359  on  July  2017.  (Exhibit  4)  The  more  recent  March  2020  credit  report  shows  a
balance of $7,599. (Exhibit 5) In her answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegation
on  the  basis  that  the  amount  owed  is  now  $2,699  with  $350  monthly  payments.  She
explained it stems from a car loan she apparently co-signed with her father who passed
away unexpectedly in March 2016. (Answer at Attachment B) In the June 2021 attorney
letter,  the  attorney  advises  that  Applicant  settled  the  case  agreeing  to  pay  a  total  of
$9,000  in  $350  monthly  installments;  has  paid  $7,000  per  the  agreement;  and  has  a
balance  due  of  $2,000  as  of  the  date  of  the  letter.  Applicant  did  not  provide
documentary proof of payment or satisfaction of a settlement agreement or judgment. I
find this account is unresolved.
Altogether,  the  nine  medical  collection  accounts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.c  –  k  total  about
$6,875. In the June 2021 attorney letter, the attorney advises, in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6,
that Applicant has amicably resolved two collection lawsuits for unpaid residual medical
bills  as  follows:  (1)  agreeing  to  pay  $4,293  in  $250  monthly  installments  beginning
August 2021; and (2) agreeing to pay $1,706 in $150 monthly installments beginning in
June 2021. (Exhibit A) A third collection lawsuit for residual medical bills in the amount
of $6,622 is pending while Applicant is attempting to correct a medical billing error with
an  insurance  provider.  (Exhibit  A)  Applicant  did  not  provide  documentary  proof  of
installment  agreements.  Likewise,  she  did  not  provide
payment  per
documentation to establish the billing error she asserts is the basis of her dispute. I find
the nine medical collection accounts are unresolved.

Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3  The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.6
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive

indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability   to   live   within  one’s  means,  satisfy   debts,   and   meet
financial  obligations  may   indicate   poor  self-control,  lack  of   judgment,   or
unwillingness  to   abide   by   rules   and   regulations,   all   of  which  can   raise
questions  about  an   individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and   ability   to
protect classified  or sensitive  information. . ..
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying
conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶  19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  or difficulties  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.
Substantial evidence shows Applicant has about $27,000 in delinquent accounts, which
are unresolved and ongoing. The disqualifying conditions noted above apply.
An applicant lives in the real world and can expect real-world problems, such as
a  job  loss.  The  security  clearance  process  recognizes  that  bad  things  can  happen  to
good  people and has a  certain  tolerance for the possibility of  human  error  and honest
mistakes. But an applicant is  still expected to keep their house in reasonable order.  In
financial cases, keeping their house in order includes providing a reasonable amount of
documentation  in  support  of  their  case  to  show  whatever  steps  and  remedial  actions
they are taking to resolve their financial problems. The security clearance process, like
other  large  bureaucratic  institutions  such  as  banks,  hospitals,  universities,  and
insurance companies, does not run on word-of-mouth. It runs on documentation.
Applicant  has  not  sufficiently  explained,  extenuated,  or  mitigated  her  history  of
financial  problems.  I  have  reviewed  the  mitigating  conditions  under  Guideline  F  and
conclude none are fully applicable. With that said, I am not concerned about the 2012
Chapter  7  bankruptcy  case  because  it  happened  nearly  a  decade  ago  and  was  the
result  of  a  divorce.  Applicant  has  not  remarried  since  her  last  divorce  in  2011.  The
bankruptcy is no longer a present concern.
The  same  cannot  be said for the  remaining $27,000  in  delinquent accounts.  Of
some concern here are the implications of the numerous collection lawsuits (six  during
2018-2021) brought against Applicant as outlined in the June 2021 attorney letter. The
number  of  lawsuits  suggests  a  measurable  degree  of  financial  irresponsibility  or
instability or both. Concerning her various claims of repayment, the June 2021 attorney
letter  is  helpful  information  but  by  itself  not  sufficient  to  fully  credit  Applicant.  What  is
missing here should be obvious; namely, documentation to establish proof of payment.
In  short,  Applicant  has  not  provided  sufficient  documentary  evidence  to  establish  her
claims  of  payment  made  to  her  various  creditors  as  well  as  the  current  status  of  her
debts. Accordingly, she does not receive the benefit of mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d).
Following Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to  protect
classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence
as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that she
has not met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with
the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph  1, Guideline  F:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs  1.a  –  1.k:
Against Applicant
Subparagraph  1.l:
For Applicant
Conclusion
It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for
access to classified information. National security eligibility is denied.
