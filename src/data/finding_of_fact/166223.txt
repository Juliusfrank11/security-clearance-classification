Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges in March 2019 Applicant used marijuana twice while granted
access to classified information. (Item 1) In his December 8, 2014 SCA, Applicant said
he used marijuana about once a month during his first two years of college, and his most
recent marijuana use was during Hurricane Sandy  (October 22 to November 2, 2012).
(Item 4 at 37) He did not hold a security clearance when he used marijuana in 2012. (Id.)
In his 2014 SCA, he said:
I do  not  plan on using  this drug because  since  then  I  have  removed  myself
from   that   environment   and   no   longer  feel  attracted   to   partaking   in  that
behavior. I have  realized  that  some  of the  decisions I  have  made  in the  past
can negatively affect my future and  my capacity to work. (Id.)
On  March  31,  2015,  an  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  investigator
interviewed  Applicant.  (Item  6)  His  2015  OPM  interview  was  consistent  with  his  2014
SCA. His only illegal drug use involved his use of marijuana. (Id. at 7) The OPM summary
of interview states, “[Applicant] has no intention of any future [illegal] drug use. He is not
interested in future drug use, and he realizes that using drugs can negatively affect his
future and his capacity to work.” (Id.)
In his June 7, 2019 SCA, Applicant said that he used marijuana from November
2010 to October 2012 about once a month during his first two years in college. (Item 3 at
44-45)  He  did  not  use  marijuana  from  2012  until  March  2019.  (Id.  at  45)  He  used
marijuana twice in March 2019 while he held a security clearance while “in a social setting
after having a few drinks with some college friends who were visiting from out of state.”
(Id.)  He  does  not  continue  to  associate  with  the  college  friends  with  whom  he  used
marijuana. (Id.) He said:
I  do   not   intend   to   use   this  drug   in  the   future   because   I  consider  this  an
isolated  instance  and  I  would like  to  note  that I am  not  a  habitual user by
any means. I am  extremely remorseful of the  choice that I  made  and it was
a complete lapse  of judgement. (Id.)
On  August  21,  2019,  an  OPM  investigator  interviewed  Applicant.  (Item  5)  His
interview about Applicant’s marijuana use was consistent with his 2019 SCA. (Id. at 9) He
said he does not intend to use marijuana in the future, and he does not associate with the
people who used marijuana with him in 2019. (Id.) He has not tested positive for use of
illegal drugs. (Id.) His 2019 marijuana use was while he held a security clearance. (Id.)
In his SOR response, Applicant described his 2019 marijuana use as “an isolated
event,”  and  a  “lapse  of  judgement.”  (Item  2)  He  observed  that  recreational  use  of
marijuana  in  his  state is not  prohibited by state  law.  (Id.) In  July 2020, he moved  to  a
different state. (Id.) He promised to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, and not to
use marijuana in the future. (Id.)
In  his  FORM  response,  Applicant  expressed  remorse  for  his  marijuana  use  in
2019. (FORM) On September 17, 2021, he provided a hair sample for testing, and the
results from a hair follicle drug screen indicating no use of illegal drugs. (Id.) He said:
[H]e  was unhappy with [his] career and  felt there were limited  opportunities
for growth. [H]e  was uncertain  whether [he]  wanted  to  continue  working  as
an  Engineer for a  Federal Contractor . . .  and  [he] was planning  on  pursuing
a   career  in  real  estate   investing   which  meant  [he]  would  no   longer  need
access to classified information. (Id. at 1)
He subsequently decided to continue working as an engineer for a federal contractor. He
is  passionate  about  his  current  employment,  and  he  has  abandoned  his  idea  about  a
career in real estate. (Id.) He proposed marriage; he is working on his master’s degree;
