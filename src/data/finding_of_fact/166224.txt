Applicant  is  a  59-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  where  she  has
worked since 2002. She held a security clearance from about 2003 until it was revoked
because  of  her  finances  in  2011.  She  has  associate’s  (2008),  bachelor’s  (2012),  and
master’s  (2017)  degrees.  She  is  married  with  two  adult  children  and  two  adult
stepchildren. (Transcript (Tr.) at 21-23; GE 1-3)
The SOR alleges $15,035 owed on a charged-off auto loan; eight miscellaneous
delinquent debts totaling about $12,300; and a $179 medical debt. The delinquent debts
are listed on an April 2020 credit report. Applicant admitted that she owed the debts at
one time, but she denied that she owed the amounts alleged in the SOR.
Applicant  attributed  her  financial  problems  to  her  and  her  husband’s  medical
issues. Her husband’s  medical problems  limit his work to  a  part-time basis. She is the
primary  provider  for  her  family,  which  includes  her  daughter  and  three  grandchildren
who live with Applicant and her husband. She also assisted in paying the expenses for
her brother’s funeral in January 2020. (Tr. at 19-20, 25-28, 37, 50, 53; GE 2)
Applicant  contracted  with  a  debt-resolution  company  in  August  2019.  She
enrolled  eleven  debts,  totaling  $21,390,  in  the  company’s  debt-resolution  program
(DRP).  The  six debts alleged  in SOR  ¶¶  1.b and  1.d through 1.h were  included  in  the
DRP. SOR ¶ 1.c alleges $2,583 owed to a bank. That debt is not specifically identified
in the DRP, but two debts of $1,983 and $1,111 to the same bank are in the DRP. The
evidence supports that the SOR ¶ 1.c debt, or a refinanced version of the debt, is in the
DRP.  The  $15,035  charged-off  auto  loan  (SOR  ¶  1.a);  a  $685  charged-off  debt  to  a
bank (SOR ¶ 1.i); and the $179 medical debt (SOR ¶ 1.j) were not included in the DRP.
There were three debts in the DRP totaling $11,083 that were not alleged in the SOR.1
(Tr. at 28; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 4, 5; AE C, D)
Applicant  agreed  to  deposit  $338  per  month  into  an  escrow  account  with  the
debt-settlement  company.  The  company  agreed  to  negotiate  settlements  with  her
creditors and use the accumulated funds in the escrow account, minus their fees, to pay
the settlements. In addition to their start-up and monthly fees, the company would earn
fees based on the amount of any debt that was settled. (AE C, D)
Applicant stated that her debts were not delinquent when she contracted with the
debt-settlement  company.  She  did  not  understand  the  DRP.  She  thought  it  was  a
consolidation loan that would pay her creditors, and she would pay the loan. She did not
realize that her accounts went into a past-due delinquent status. She continued with the
1   Any   matter  that  was   not  alleged  in  the  SOR   will   not  be   used  for  disqualification   purposes.  It  may   be
considered  when   assessing   Applicant’s   overall   financial   situation,  in  the  application   of   mitigating
conditions, and during the  whole-person  analysis.
DRP because it was achieving results. Applicant established that she consistently paid
the $338 monthly payments since the DRP’s inception. (Tr. at 19-20, 28-30; AE E-I)
In  June  2021,  Applicant  took  out  a  consolidation  loan  of  $12,018  through  the
debt-resolution company. The annual interest rate is 25.24%. Applicant did not receive
the  funds;  the  funds  were  to  be  disbursed  to  the  creditors  in  the  DRP,  minus  the
company’s fees. In June 2021, the company credited drafts totaling about $5,771 from
the  loan  to  her  DRP.  The  company  paid  $4,727  to  six  creditors,  and  debited  $724  in
settlement  fees.  In  July  2021,  the  company  credited  drafts  totaling  about  $5,084  from
the loan to her DRP. The company paid $4,602 to three creditors, and debited $1,530 in
settlement fees. The eleven debts in the DRP, including the seven debts alleged in SOR
¶¶  1.b  through  1.h  are  either  settled  and  paid  or  in  the  process  of  being  settled  and
paid. (AE E-H, J-L)
Applicant  earns  about  $32,000  annually.  Her  husband  works  part-time,  and  her
daughter  works  and  contributes  to  the  household.  In  addition  to  her  DRP  payments,
Applicant  is  current  on  her  $1,622  monthly  mortgage  payments.  She  has  about
$163,000 in deferred student loans. The $15,035 charged-off auto loan was taken out in
about October 2016. Applicant stated that  she and her husband bought the vehicle for
between  $30,000  and  $40,000,  and  it  was  voluntarily  repossessed  one  to  three  years
after the purchase. She and her husband are current on two auto loans. They pay $674
per month on an auto loan of about $36,500 that was taken out in March 2018; and they
pay $871 per month on a $47,500 auto loan that was taken out in March 2019. The July
2021  credit  report  lists  delinquent  telecommunications  debts  of  $2,039  and  $554.
Applicant stated that she would add the remaining debts alleged in the SOR and the two
telecommunications debts to the DRP. (Tr. at 29, 37-42, 47-54; GE 4, 5; AE E, F)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
March  2020.  Under  the  investigations  and  clearance  record  questions,  she  failed  to
report that she was previously granted a security clearance and that it was revoked in
2011.  She  reported  one  delinquent  debt  under  the  financial  questions.  She  also
reported  that she  was utilizing  a  “credit counseling  service or other similar resource to
resolve [her] financial difficulties,” with the following explanation:
[Debt-settlement company] has provided  a  non-credit based  consolidation
option,  that  consolidates   my   debts   into   one   lower  payment.   Paying
outstanding balances down and  eventually off.
.
.
.
This   plan   ha[s]   consolidated   my   debts  into   one   affordable   monthly
payment.  [Debt-settlement  company]  works  with   my   creditor[s]   to   get  my
debt paid off in three  [and]  a half years or sooner.
Applicant  denied  intentionally  providing  false  information  on  the  SF  86.  She
stated the answers to the questions  about her security clearance were a  mistake, and
that  she  had  no  reason  to  lie  about  it,  because  the  DOD  was  well  aware  that  her
security  clearance  had  been  revoked.  She  thought  she  was  being  honest  about  the
financial questions based on her misinterpretation of the DRP. (Tr. at 30-36; Applicant’s
response to SOR) After considering all of the evidence, I conclude that Applicant did not
intentionally falsify the SF 86.
Applicant submitted letters attesting to her excellent job performance and strong
moral  character.  She  is  praised  for  her  trustworthiness,  reliability,  professionalism,
dedication, and judgment. (AE A, B)
