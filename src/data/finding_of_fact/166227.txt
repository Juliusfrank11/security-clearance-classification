Applicant  is  a  56-year-old  senior  professional  planner  of  a  defense  contractor
who  seeks  eligibility  to  hold  a  public  trust  position.  The  admitted  allegations  are
incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant married in March 2006 and divorced in June 2011. (GE 1) She has no
children  from  this  marriage.  (GE  1)  She  remarried  in  August  2016  and  divorced  in
November  2018.  (GE  1)  She  has  no  children  from  this  marriage.  Applicant  attended
college  classes from 1983 to 1986, but did not  earn  a degree or diploma.  (GE 1) She
reported no military service. (GE 1)
Since  2019,  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  her  current  employer.  (GE  1;  Tr.
25-26) She reported periods of unemployment while seeking new jobs following layoffs
due to lost employer contracts, and while she recovered from surgical procedures. (GE
1; Tr. 26) She has never possessed a public trust position. (GE 1)
Applicant’s  finances
Between 2012 and 2019, Applicant accumulated 14 delinquent debts. (GEs 1-4)
Her  listed  delinquent  debts  are  comprised  of  12  delinquent  consumer  accounts
exceeding $14,000,  one  delinquent medical account  of  $46, and one  state  tax debt  of
$6,230,  covering  tax  years  2012-2013  and  2015-2016.  (GEs  1-4)  Applicant  attributed
her  debt  delinquencies  to  a  combination  of  involuntary,  fault-free  layoffs  due  to
employer  contract  losses  and  emergency  surgeries  to  repair  an  anterior  collateral
ligament (ACL) for the second time in 2019. (AE A)
While  Applicant  is  credited   with   entering   into   a   recent  tax   payment  agreement
with her state of residence, she has not to date documented any payments to the state’s
taxing   agency,  and   the   outstanding   balance   remains  unresolved.  (GEs  1-4   and   AE   A;
Tr. 35-36) Since  her hearing, she  has received  installment  payment offers from  three  of
her listed  SOR creditors (covered  by  SOR ¶¶  1.c.  for $1,997, 1.e  for $1,070, and  1.g  for
$886.00).   Each   of  these   installment  offers  propose   monthly   payment  plans  and   seek
written acceptance  of the respective offers from Applicant. (AEs B-C)
Applicant’s submissions include  neither documented acceptances nor good-faith
upfront  payments  accompanying  her  formal  acceptances.  (AEs  A-C)  Without  verified
acceptances  of  the  creditor  settlement  offers  and  documented  first  payments  in
compliance  with  the  terms  of  the  respective  offers,  resolution  of  these  debts  remain
works in progress.
Of the debts covered by the SOR, only one of them can be considered resolved
for evidentiary purposes.  Applicant  could  not  identify SOR  debt  ¶ 1.m  (a medical  debt
for $46), which was unfamiliar to her. (GEs 1-4) It is a small debt that could reasonably
have been resolved earlier or simply forgotten by Applicant.  Either way, inferences are
warranted that the debt is resolved in Applicant’s favor.
By her own acknowledgements, Applicant is not in a position at this time to make
any serious inroads  into addressing her  delinquent accounts.  She is doing all she can
just to cover her necessities. (Tr. 49) She has no 401(k) retirement or savings accounts
to draw from. (Tr. 38)
While Applicant is current with her non-SOR debts, she has not sought financial
counseling  to  help  her  with  her  finances  and  needs  a  second  job  to  address  her
delinquent  accounts.  (Tr.  49)  Finding  a  part-time  dog-walking  job  promises  to  help
Applicant  with  her  accounts,  but  is  not  likely  in  the  short-run  to  produce  enough  extra
income to enable her make any meaningful initiatives in addressing her accrued debts.
