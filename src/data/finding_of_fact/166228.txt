Applicant is a 59-year-old help desk employee of a defense contractor who seeks
a security clearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted as relevant
and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant  married  in  November  1986  and  has  one  child  (age  20)  from  this
marriage. (Item 3) He earned a bachelor’s degree in June 1992 and a master’s degree
in June 2015. He reported no military service. (Item 3) Since September 2018, Applicant
has  been  employed  by  his  current  employer.  (Item  3)  Previously,  he  worked  for  other
employers in information technology-related jobs. (Item 3)
Applicant’s  finances
Applicant ceased working in 2014 due to his wife’s fall at work the same year and
his  own  need  for  six  surgeries,  both  of  which  required  lifestyle  changes  that  brought
about major increases in their outlays once their work compensation payments ceased.
(Items  2  and  7)  Applicant’s  financial  situation  was  further  stressed  by  his  bank’s
continued  interception  of  Applicant’s  payouts  to  his  creditors  to  facilitate  the  bank’s
prioritizing  of  its  own  fees  owed  by  Applicant  and  his  wife.  (Items  2  and  7)  Once
Applicant discovered how the bank was misallocating his earmarked creditor payments,
he took remedial steps to mitigate any further losses by his creditor and worked with the
creditors that were receptive to his good-faith payment initiatives. (Items 2 and 7)
Between  2017  and  2021,  Applicant  accumulated  two  delinquent  accounts:  a
student loan account in the amount of $22,732 and a credit card account in the amount
of  $7,952.  (items  4-9)  Both  of  these  debts  remained  unresolved  and  outstanding  until
this year.
Upon
receiving
the  SOR,  Applicant  contacted  his  personal  consulting
representative  who  handles  his  student  loans.  (Items  2  and  10)  He  was  able  to
successfully enroll in his student loan lender’s loan consolidation program and made his
first scheduled monthly payment (for $269) in May 2021. (Items 2 and 7) Satisfying the
agreed terms of Applicant’s direct student loan consolidation loan, Applicant paid off the
$22,732 loan balance in August 2021. (Items 7-8)
The only remaining delinquent debt covered in the SOR is a listed $7,952 credit
card  debt  owed  to  the  SOR  creditor  in  ¶  1b.  Applicant  documented  his  pay  off  of  this
debt in May 2021 in the agreed reduced amount of $3,181. (Items 7 and 9)
