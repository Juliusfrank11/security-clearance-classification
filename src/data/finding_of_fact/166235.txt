November 2019. Applicant attended college but did not attain a degree. He received a
correctional officer certification in 2003. He served in the active Army National Guard from

The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  has  four  delinquent  debts  that  are  in  collections  or
charged off, totaling about $34,000. Applicant admitted debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and
1.b, and denied ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d. He noted that while he was in the Marine Corps, he went
through a difficult divorce where his spouse obtained several loans allegedly with a power
of attorney before his divorce, in which he was responsible. He said he disputed the loans,
but they have not been removed from his credit report.
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  a  credit  union  auto  loan  that  has  been  charged  off  for
approximately $21,661. The delinquent loan is reflected in Applicant’s April and October
2020 credit reports as an individual account in his name for $27,843, assigned in 2011,
with the last account activity occurring on September 2020, and a charged-off balance of
$21,661. No account dispute is noted in the credit reports. Applicant claimed in his Answer
that the  loan  was for a vehicle  that he  was “required by my Marine Corps command to
give to my wife while we were going through the divorce and she decided to call the bank
and had it repossessed since she had possession of it.” He stated that he disputed the
repossession  and  refused  to  pay  the  loan  balance  since  the  credit  union  took  the  car
against  his  wishes.  He  did  not  present  documentary  evidence  to  support  his  claim  of
dispute or improper financial practices by his ex-spouse or the credit union.
SOR ¶ 1.b is a credit card account that has been charged off for approximately
$200. Applicant stated in his Answer that the card was for military uniform expenses, but
was  paid  off.  He  said  he  contacted  the  creditor,  who  cannot  find  information  on  the
account, and he was unsuccessful in having it removed from his credit report. The account
appears on his April 2020 credit report as a charged-off account with a zero balance, but
his October 2020 credit report reflects a $200 balance with the last activity in June 2014.
The  account  is  an  individual  debt  in  his name.  Applicant  did  not  present  documentary
evidence to support his claim of dispute or payment of the debt.
SOR  ¶  1.c  is a  loan  account  that has  been transferred  to  a  collection  agent for
approximately $2,146. Applicant claimed that his ex-spouse obtained the loan in his name
before the divorce, and he disputed the account. He refuses to pay the debt because he
did not receive the loan proceeds, and expects it to be removed from his credit report.
The  debt is not  reflected  on  his October 2020  credit report,  but  is present  on  his April
2020 credit report as a debt that was placed for collection with the last activity date of
April 2020 and a balance of $2,146. Applicant did not present documentary evidence to
support his claim of dispute or financial irregularities.
SOR ¶ 1.d is charged-off loan for approximately $10,420. Applicant stated that his
ex-spouse  obtained  the  loan  in  his  name  before  the  divorce.  He  stated  it  was  sent  to
collections as a result of his dispute of the account, and had not been removed from his
credit report. He refuses to pay the debt because he did not receive the loan proceeds.
The  debt is not  reflected  on  his October 2020  credit report,  but  is present  on  his April
2020 credit report as a debt that was charged off with the last activity date of March 2020
and a balance of $10,420. Applicant did not present documentary evidence to support his
claim of dispute or financial irregularities.
No recent evidence of Applicant’s current financial status, debt disputes, or credit
counseling  was  provided  for  the  record.  He  noted  in  his  Answer  that  he  recently
purchased  a  home,  and  resolved  credit  matters  to  do  so.  His  spouse  is  an  employed
professional, and he said they live within their means and have not missed a credit card
payment in years.
