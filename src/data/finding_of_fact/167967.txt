Under  Guideline  F, the  SOR alleged  that   Applicant  did  not file  his  federal (SOR
1.a) or state  (SOR 1.b)  income  tax  returns  for  the  2016  tax  year; and  that  he  owes $9,045
for 12  past-due  or delinquent debts (SOR 1.c –  1.n).  In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant

established  by Applicant’s admissions, I make the  following findings of  fact.
Applicant  is  a  43-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  for  whom  he  has
worked since  May 2018. In his e-QIP, he disclosed that he had not filed his federal or
state income tax returns for the 2016 tax year, but stated that he would file those returns
“within the three-year deadline.” He has not produced any information  showing that his
past-due returns have been filed. (FORM, Item 2)
Applicant  did  not  disclose  any  other  adverse  financial  information  in  his  e-QIP.
During his background investigation, government investigators obtained credit reports in
January and September 2019 that document all of the debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant
has  not  produced  any  information  regarding  the  current  status  of  his  debts.  Available
information does not show that he has acted to repay or otherwise resolve his debts, or
that he has obtained any financial counseling or other professional financial assistance.
