Applicant  is  a  29-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  for  whom  he  has
worked  since  December  2020.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from  2012
until  he  was  honorably  discharged  in  2016.  He  seeks  to  retain  a  security  clearance,
which  he  has  held  since  he  was  in  the  Navy.  He  is  attending  college  in  pursuit  of  a
bachelor’s  degree.  He  is  divorced.  He  and  his  fiancée  have  a  child,  who  was  born  in
2020. (Transcript (Tr.) at 17-19, 33-34, 92; GE 1; AE M)
While serving in the Navy in November 2014, Applicant had access to a CONEX
box, a container used to transport and store equipment. He went into the box and stole
camera equipment. The unit that owned the box initially reported  to the Naval Criminal
Investigative Service (NCIS) that 37 cameras valued at about $20,000 were stolen. An
inventory of the equipment disclosed that three cameras and nine lenses totaling about
$3,438 were missing. (GE 2, 3, 10)
Applicant attempted to sell a camera and a lens to another service member. He
sent pictures of the equipment to the service member. A third service member found out
about  it,  and  advised  Applicant  to  return  the  equipment.  Applicant  admitted  to  other
service  members  that  he  took  camera  equipment  home,  but  he  had  returned  the
equipment. (GE 3, 3, 10)
Applicant waived his right to remain silent when he was questioned by the NCIS
in November 2014. He lied and stated that he did not take the missing equipment, and
he did not attempt to sell it. He was questioned again in January 2015. He admitted that
he had not been truthful during the first interview. He stated that he “was scared and in
flight  mode  during  [his]  first  interview.”  He  stated  that  he  was  “a  good  Sailor  and  the
thought of being in trouble frightened  [him].”  He stated that he and a petty officer went
into the box, and the petty officer took about three to four cameras. The petty officer told
him that the cameras appeared to be from his previous unit and were not serialized, so
the Navy could not account for them. He told Applicant that he planned to use them as
Christmas presents. Applicant stated that after seeing a petty officer take  cameras, he
decided to take one also. He admitted that he took a camera and a lens home.  (Tr. at
35-37; GE 10)
In March 2015, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment (NJP) under Article 15
of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for violations of Articles 107 (false official
statement) and 121 (larceny and wrongful appropriation) of the UCMJ. He was reduced
one pay grade to E-3. (Tr. at 39; GE 1-3, 10)
Applicant claims that he has accepted responsibility for his crimes, but he really
has not. In his January 2018 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), he
wrote  “I took a  camera that was given  to me when I found out it was stolen I returned
the item.” During his background interview in January 2019, he stated that a supervisor
told  him  that  the  camera  equipment  had  been  purchased  as  surplus  items.  He  stated
that  he  took  the  camera  from  the  supervisor  because  he  hoped  to  be  assigned  to  the
supervisor’s unit and did not want to create any strife with the supervisor. He stated that
he   took  the   camera  with   the   understanding   that  it  was  not  a   crime   because   the
equipment  was  surplus.  He  stated   that  the   next  day,  another  service  member  came
across  the   box   and   asked   Applicant  what  happened   to   their   box   and   the   equipment
inside   it.   Applicant   told   the   investigator  that   he   immediately   went  to   his   backpack  and
retrieved   the   camera.   He  told   the   investigator  that   he   lied   to   NCIS   because   of  a   “bro
code” of  protecting  the  supervisor from  discipline  because  Applicant  wanted  to  get into
the same unit.  (GE 1, 2)
Applicant  provided  similar  testimony  at  his  hearing.  He  stated  that  he  did  not
realize it was stealing or a crime when he took the camera. (Tr. at 34-45, 99-108) I did
not find any of his testimony credible. I find that he stole at least one camera and a lens,
lied  about  it  to  the  NCIS,  and  continued  to  lie  about  it  up  to  and  during  his  security
clearance hearing.
Applicant  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  in  Iraq  from  about  August  2017  to
December 2017. His employer at the time filed an incident report on the Joint Personnel
Adjudication  System  (JPAS)  that  stated  that  Applicant  “abandoned  his  job  site  .  .  .
without notification  of chain of  command,” and  caused  the  site  to  drop  below  “contract
minimum operating requirements and  placed  warfighters at risk.”  Applicant wrote in his
2018  SF  86  that  he  left  the  job  “due  to  management’s  poor  ability  to  handle
confrontation  on  the  site.”  He  stated  in  his  background  interview  that  his  supervisor
created  a  hostile  work  environment.  Applicant  testified  that  his  request  to  move  to
another site in November 2017 was disapproved. He was told if he did not like the site,
he  should  quit,  which  he  did.  The  company  wanted  Applicant  to  return  to  the  United
States to out-process, but Applicant refused because he wanted to stay in Iraq and work
for another contractor. He provided statements from individuals who shared his negative
view of the company. (Tr. at 45-66, 109-122, 131-133; GE 1-4; AE I-M)
Applicant was hired by another defense contractor in Iraq the day after he left the
job  site  of  his  previous  employer.  He  worked  for  the  company  in  Iraq  from  December
2017 to March 2018, and from May 2018 until he was sent home early in June 2018 for
leaving  the  base  without  following  proper  protocol  and  poor  performance.  His
employment was terminated a few days later in the United States. Applicant denied any
misconduct. He stated that he complied with all of the regulations regarding leaving the
base. (Tr. at 66-82, 122-129; GE 2, 5)
The delinquent debts in the SOR were based on credit reports obtained in May
2018,  March  2019,  and  November  2019.  Applicant  attributed  his financial  problems  to
mismanagement  of  his  finances  by  his  ex-wife  while  he  was  working  overseas.  He
stated that she opened accounts without his knowledge.  He testified that the charged-
off  credit union debt alleged in SOR ¶ 2.f is the only debt in the SOR that he took  out
himself. He also stated that divorce, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the birth of his child
adversely  affected  his  finances.  He  contracted  with  a  credit-repair  company  in  June
2019 to assist him in disputing inaccurate items on his credit report. (Tr. at 20-22, 84-94;
GE 1, 3-5; AE F)
Applicant paid the $566 debt in SOR ¶ 2.a with a credit card on June 3, 2021. He
paid the $389 debt  in SOR  ¶ 2.b  with  a credit  card on  July 1, 2021.  (Tr. at 19-22, 92;
(GE 6-9; AE A, B)
SOR ¶ 2.c alleges $1,536 owed to a financial institution that specializes in loans
to military members. Applicant denied owing the debt.  He testified that he never had a
loan  from  that  financial  institution.  However,  during  his  January  2019  background
interview, he acknowledged the debt and stated that he planned to contact the creditor
when  payments  could  be  made.  The  credit  reports  list  the  account  as  becoming
delinquent in 2013. The debt is not listed on the November 2020 credit report. The debt
was  past  the  seven-year  reporting  window,  so  it  should  not  be  listed  on  the  report
regardless of whether it was disputed.  (Tr. at 22-23; Applicant’s response  to  SOR; GE
2, 6-10)
The $960 unidentified medical debt in SOR ¶ 2.d is listed on the November 2019
Equifax credit report, but not the November 2020 Equifax report. (Tr. at 23-24; GE 6, 7)
The  $4,788  delinquent  debt  in  SOR  ¶  2.e  is  listed  on  every  credit  report  in
evidence. Applicant testified that he disputed the debt because the account was opened
in  his  ex-wife’s  name.  He  reported  the  debt  on  his  January  2018  SF  86  with  the
comment: “I originally was not smart with my money [and] spent money I did not have.”
He confirmed it was his debt during his January 2019 background interview. He stated
that  he  would  make  payments  on  the  debt  as  soon  as  more  pressing  accounts  were
paid off. (Tr. at 25-26; GE 1, 2, 6-9; AE F, O)
SOR  ¶  2.f  alleges  $8,774  owed  to  a  credit  union  for  a  charged-off  debt.  The
credit  reports  list  the  balance  on  the  account  as  $4,388.  In  February  2021,  Applicant
agreed to pay $90 per month to the credit union. The credit union reported in June 2021
that Applicant was in compliance with the agreement; he had paid a total of $450; and
the remaining balance was $3,938. He testified that he increased the monthly payment
to $150. (Tr. at 26, 87; GE 6-9; AE C)
Applicant  denied  owing  the  $1,674  charged-off  debt  in  SOR  ¶  2.g.  He  testified
that  he  had no  recollection  of  opening the  account,  and  that  he  suspected  his ex-wife
opened the account without his knowledge. He disputed the debt. The debt is listed on
credit reports through November 2019. The most recent balance was $4,752. The credit
reports  list  the  account  as  becoming  delinquent  in  2013.  The  debt  is  not  listed  on  the
November 2020 credit report. The debt was past the seven-year reporting window, so it
should  not  be  listed  on  the  report  regardless  of  whether  it  was  disputed.  (Tr.  at  28;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 6-9; AE O)
Applicant  paid  the  $492  and  $504  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  2.h  and  2.i  in  about  March
2020. (Tr. at 29-30, 94-95; GE 6-8; AE D, E)
Applicant  denied  owing  the  $1,581  charged-off  debt  in  SOR  ¶  2.j.  He  testified
that  he  had  no  recollection  of  opening the  account.  He  disputed  the  debt. The  debt  is
listed  on  credit  reports  up  through  November  2019.  The  most  recent  balance  was
$5,123. The credit reports list the account as becoming delinquent in 2013. The debt is
not  listed  on  the  November  2020  credit  report.  The  debt  was  past  the  seven-year
reporting window,  so  it  should not be listed on  the  report regardless  of  whether it  was
disputed.  He  acknowledged  responsibility  for  the  debt  during  his  January  2019
background interview. (Tr. at 30; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 6-9)
SOR  ¶  2.k  alleges  a  $2,437  charged-off  debt.  Applicant  disputed  the  debt,  and
stated that it was deleted from his credit report. The debt is listed on every credit report
in  evidence,  but  his  credit-repair  company  reported  that  it  was  deleted  by  the  three
credit  reporting  agencies.  The  credit  reports list  the  last payment  was  received  on  the
account  in  April 2014. The  debt  is not  listed on  the  November 2020  credit  report. The
debt was past the seven-year reporting window, so it should not be listed on the report
regardless of whether it was disputed. (Tr. at 31; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 6-9;
AE O)
In  June  2021,  Applicant  used  a  credit  card  to  pay  a  $1,197  debt  that  was  not
alleged  in  the  SOR.  He  stated  that  his  finances  have  stabilized.  He  admitted  that  he
owed about $4,600 to the IRS for income taxes for tax year 2019.1  (Tr. at 31-32, 96-98,
136-139; AE G, H)
Applicant  submitted  documents  and  letters  attesting  to  his  excellent  job
performance  and  strong  moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his  professionalism,
patriotism,  dedication,  work  ethic,  compassion,  reliability,  trustworthiness,  loyalty,
integrity, and ability to follow rules and regulations. (AE K-N)
