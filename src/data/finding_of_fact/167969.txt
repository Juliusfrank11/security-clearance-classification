Applicant is a 40-year-old man with one child, age 9. Applicant was married twice
previously. Both marriages ended in divorce. (Item 1 at 17-19) He earned a high school
diploma in 2000, and he earned an associate’s degree in 2005. (Item 1 at 12-13) He has
been working for a defense contractor as a technical product designer since 2005. (Item 1
at 13) He has never held a security clearance. (Item 1 at 31)
Applicant used marijuana, on average, once every other year from approximately

acquaintances.  (Item  4  at  29-30;  Item 5) He has not used marijuana since May 2018.
(Items 3-4) In November 2019, he executed a statement of intent to not use marijuana

The SOR alleges six debts totaling approximately $11,000. Applicant incurred them
between 2012 and 2015. (Items 4-10)
The  debt alleged  in subparagraph  2.a  is a  delinquent phone  bill  for $337.  (Item  3  at
3)  It stems from a cell phone call that his former stepdaughter made  when  she  lived  with
him.  Applicant  initially   disputed   the   bill,  contending   that  the   phone   company   errantly
charged   a   long-distance   rate   for the   phone   call,  bypassing   a   local cell   phone   tower in
violation  of  Federal Communications Commission  regulations. (Item  5  at 3) By  the  date  of
Applicant’s answer in January  2021, he  had  concluded  that it was less expensive to pay
this bill than  to  contest it in court. (Item  3  at 3) He provided  no  evidence  that he  has either
paid this bill or arranged a payment plan.
Subparagraph 2.b, totaling $170, is a delinquent medical bill. (Item 3 at 3) Applicant
contends that the health care provider overcharged him, and that he met his deductible.
(Item 3 at 3) He referenced an explanation of benefits form substantiating his contention,
but did not submit the form into the record.
Subparagraph 2.c, totaling $82, is owed to a collection agent. In Applicant’s answer,
he stated that he would pay this bill within a month. (Item 1 at 2) He provided no proof of
payment.
Applicant incurred the bill alleged in subparagraph 2.d, totaling $232, when his then
wife  took  their  daughter  to  the  emergency  room.  While  the  hospital  was  checking  her
daughter into their system, Applicant’s then wife called him for their insurance information.
He told her that the emergency room was an out-of-network health provider, and to take
their  daughter  to  a  nearby  hospital  that  was  in-network.  Applicant’s  then  wife  obliged,
leaving before their daughter had received treatment or finished checking in. (Item 3 at 3)
Applicant received a  $232 bill from the out-of-network hospital even though his daughter
had not received treatment or finished checking in. His insurance carrier would not provide
partial reimbursement because his daughter had not received service. The hospital that
billed him refused to negotiate a resolution. (Item 3 at 3)  The bill remains outstanding.
Applicant provided no documentation of any attempts to satisfy or resolve this bill.
Subparagraph 2.e, totaling $129, is a utility disconnect fee Applicant incurred after
his home was destroyed by a fire in approximately 2016. (Item 3 at 4) Applicant contends
that  he  should  not  have  been  charged  this  fee  because  no  disconnect  services  were
provided, as the electric meter melted during the fire. (Item 3 at 4) Applicant provided no
record of any attempts to satisfy or resolve this debt.
Subparagraph 2.f, totaling $10,013, is a property tax delinquency for the property
that Applicant owned before he purchased his current home. (Item 1 at 2) This debt was
satisfied after the property was sold at auction. (Item 3 at 5-8) It is unclear from the record
whether this was the house that was destroyed by the fire in 2016.
