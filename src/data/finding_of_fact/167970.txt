In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations, with explanations. His
admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence,
I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a federal contractor performing the duties
of  a  systems  engineer.  He  began  working  at  his  present  job  in  December  2018.  He
received his bachelor’s degree  in 2017. He is single with no children. He lives with his
girlfriend to whom he pays monthly rent of $500. (Tr. 6-7, 17-18, 28; GE 1)
The SOR alleged 11 delinquent accounts (a federal recoupment debt and medical
debts) totaling approximately $27,900. The debts are established by credit reports from
April 2019, November 2019, and February 2021; admissions in his March 2019 security
clearance application (SCA); Applicant’s personal subject interview (PSI) with a defense
investigator  in  August  2019;  and  his  SOR  admissions.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  –  1.k)  (GE  1-5;
Answer to SOR)
Applicant’s financial difficulties began in approximately 2011 when he dis-enrolled
from  a  university  where  he  had  accepted  an  ROTC  scholarship.  He  attended  for
approximately  two  years,  long  enough  to  garner  a  recoupment  obligation  for  his
scholarship  money,  when  he  quit  because  the  program  was  not  right  for  him.  Upon
quitting,  he  incurred  a  financial  obligation  to  the  federal  government  of  approximately
$24,000. Applicant claims he made some payments on the debt early on, but because of
low paying jobs and continuing his college education on his own, he could not keep up
with the payments and they became delinquent. (Tr. 20-21; GE 1-2)
Applicant dealt with two medical issues involving a collapsed lung, first in 2017 and
again in 2018. He was not covered by health insurance for these incidents, and he and
his mother tried to handle the resulting medical bills. Some of the SOR-related medical
debts are derived from these events. (Tr. 35-36, 38; GE 2)
The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
SOR ¶  1.a-$15,338.  This debt resulted from Applicant’s recoupment obligation to
the  federal  government  for  his  ROTC  scholarship.  In  his  SCA,  Applicant  claims  the
balance on this debt started at approximately $24,000, but his earliest credit report puts
the  initial  balance  at  approximately $20,000  in  2014.  Regardless,  it  appears  Applicant
made some payments before the debt was charged off in the amount of approximately
$15,000 in 2019. Applicant had his 2019 federal tax return refund in the amount of $2,034
involuntarily applied to this debt, as well as his 2020 federal tax refund in the amount of
$2,107.  Applicant  documented  one  voluntary  payment  toward  this  debt  on  August  25,
2021, in the amount of $300. He claims he will continue making payments in this amount
until the debt is paid. He made a similar promise of prompt payments toward this debt in
his SCA in March 2019, but failed to follow through. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 20-21;
GE 1-4; AE E-H, O, S)
SOR ¶  1.b-$6,540. Applicant incurred this medical debt in November 2011 and it
was  sold  to  a  collection  agency  in  January  2019.  On  August  25,  2021,  Applicant
documented establishing a payment plan beginning on September 25, 2021, with $300
payments coming out of his bank account monthly (no plan payments had been made
yet). He had not made any payments on the account previously. This debt is unresolved.
(Tr. 23; GE 3; AE I, O)
SOR ¶  1.c-$3,083.  Applicant incurred this medical debt in March 2018 and it was
sold  to  a  collection  agency  in  May  2019.  Applicant  documented  settling  this  debt  on
August 27, 2021, for $2,620. He had not made any payments on the account previously.
This debt is resolved. (Tr. 23; GE 4; AE J, O, Q)

sold  to  a  collection  agency  in  May  2019.  Applicant  documented  settling  this  debt  on

SOR ¶  1.k-$634.  Applicant incurred this medical debt in March 2018 and it was
sold  to  a  collection  agency  in  July  2018.  On  August  25,  2021,  Applicant  documented

Applicant provided a job appraisal that stated he was  a significant contributor to
his  organization.  He  also  provided  documentation  showing  that  he  received  a  $6,210
raise in April 2021. He provided a list of monthly expenses and claimed that he currently
has a monthly remainder of approximately $1,500 after paying all his required expenses.
He also has both private and federal insured student loans. He is current on his private
loans  and  his  federal  student  loans  in  the  amount  of  $40,000  are  in  deferment  until
approximately January 2022. (Tr. 39-42, 45, 47, 49; AE A-C, P)
