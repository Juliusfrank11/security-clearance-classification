In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  in  ¶  1.a  with
explanations. (HE 3) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings
follow.
Applicant is a 53-year-old system architect. (Tr. 6, 24) He has been employed by
the same Defense contractor since December 1996. (Tr. 24) In 1985, he graduated from
high  school, and  in 1989, he  received  a  bachelor’s degree  in engineering. (Tr. 6-7) He
has not served in the military. (Tr. 7, 24) In December 2018, he married, and he does not
have any children. (Tr. 7, 24) He has held a security clearance since July 1990. (Tr. 7)
Financial Considerations
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state  income tax
returns for TYs 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. He said he failed to timely file these federal
and  state  tax  returns  because  he  had  difficulty  gathering  the  necessary  supporting
documentation.  (Tr.  25)  He  acknowledged  that  part  of  the  problem  related  to  “not
prioritizing things correctly.” (Tr. 26) The triggering events for getting his tax returns filed
were the security clearance process (completion of the SCA and his receipt of the SOR),
and getting married in 2018. (Tr. 40-42)
Appellant’s  state  tax  returns  were  filed  the  same  day  as  his  federal  income  tax
returns were filed or shortly thereafter. (Tr. 29-30; AE B at 2) Federal income tax refunds
were not issued for TYs 2014 and 2015 because his tax returns were not filed within three
years of when they were due. State tax refunds were not issued for TYs 2014, 2015, and
2016 because state tax refunds are not issued when tax returns are not filed within two
years of when they are due. (AE B at 22-24) He did not owe any additional federal income
taxes for TYs 2014 through 2017. (Tr. 27) The state tax authority completed Applicant’s
tax return for TY 2014 and billed him $1,300 for that TY, which Applicant paid. (Tr. 27-29)
