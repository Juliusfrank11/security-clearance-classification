Applicant  is  a  37-year-old  program  manager  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since  December  2006.  (GE  1;  Tr.  11-12)  He  seeks  to  retain  his  security  clearance,
which he has held since March 2009. (Tr. 12-14)
Applicant  received  his  high  school  diploma  in  June  2002.  He  was  awarded  a
Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering in December 2006. (AE 1(H); Tr.
14-17) Applicant married in January 2014, and has an 18-year-old stepdaughter and a
9-year-old daughter. Applicant’s wife is not employed outside the home.  (GE 1; Tr. 17-
19)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant self-reported past marijuana use on his January 29, 2019 SF-86 during
his  periodic  security  clearance  renewal.  (GE  1)  He  was  subsequently  interviewed  on
May 23, 2019, by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator regarding his
marijuana  use.  (GE  2)  He  elaborated  on  his  marijuana  use  in  his  April  14,  2020  SOR
Answer as well as during his testimony. The following summarizes that drug use.
SOR ¶ 1.a alleged that from approximately June 2003 through at least December
2018, Applicant purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency; and SOR ¶ 1.b
alleged  that  Applicant  continued  to  purchase  and  use  marijuana  after  he  had  been
granted a DOD security clearance in March 2009.
In his SOR Answer, Applicant stated that he did not remember exactly what year
he  first  used  marijuana.  His  best  estimate  is  that  he  first  used  marijuana  sometime
between  2003  and  2005,  which  was  between  15  and  17  years  from  the  time  he
submitted  his  SOR  Answer.  He  used  marijuana  approximately  two  or  three  times  per
year, if that, until 2018 when his marijuana use increased to approximately one to two
times  per  month  for  a  short  period.  His  increased  marijuana  use  in  2018  came  about
when recreational marijuana use became legal in his state of residence. He stated that
he was under the mistaken belief that its use was acceptable at the federal level as well.
Applicant acknowledged his marijuana use was “extremely improvident” and added that
he has no intention to ever use marijuana or any other drug again. Applicant’s testimony
was  consistent  with  his January  29,  2019  SF-86  and  his SOR Answer.  (SOR  Answer;
Tr. 19-22; GE 1; AE 1(Q))
Applicant  used  marijuana  for  “recreational  use”  and  for  its  “relaxing  capabilities
every  now  and  then.”  Applicant  added  that  he  used  marijuana  about  20  times  while
holding  a  clearance  from  March  2009  to  December  2018,  further  adding  that  that
number was “just a guess.” He acknowledged that his marijuana use was a violation of
state  and  Federal  law,  security  clearance  regulations,  and  his  employer’s  drug-free
workplace policy. Applicant volunteered that his marijuana use was a “poor choice.” (Tr.
24-26)
The  driving  force  behind  Applicant’s  decision  to  quit  using  marijuana  occurred
when he was renewing his security clearance application in December 2018. He stated,
“it  really  dawned  on  me  I  shouldn’t  have  done  it,  and  it  was  a  poor  choice.”  Applicant
has  used  marijuana  with  his  wife.  His  wife  still  uses  marijuana,  which  is  legal  in  their
state of residence. Applicant stated that even though he has been around individuals to
include his wife who use marijuana, he is not tempted to use it anymore. (GE 2; Tr. 26-
29,  33-35)  Applicant  stated,  “trustworthiness  is  one  of  the  most  important  parts  of
having  a  Security  Clearance.  You  don’t  want  someone  that  lies.  .  .  .  You  make
mistakes, you’ve got to own up to it. So, that’s why I’m here.” (Tr. 57)
During Applicant’s March 2, 2009 OPM interview, he told the investigator that he
“stopped (using marijuana) in 2007 because the use no longer appealed to him and he
wanted to start a career.” (GE 4; Tr. 29-30)
Personal Conduct
The  concerns  identified  under  this  Guideline  are  listed  as  two  separate
allegations and discussed in order as indicated in the SOR.
The  Government  cross-alleged  the  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse
concern alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b under SOR ¶ 2.a. Additionally, the SOR alleged
that Applicant falsified his December 29, 2008 SF-86 when he disclosed marijuana use
from  November  2005  through  July  2007,  and  purportedly  failed  to  disclose  his
continuing use of marijuana as set forth in SOR ¶ 1.a.
Applicant denied falsifying his December 2008 SF-86. He explained that when he
completed his December 2008 SF-86, he was not using marijuana and had not done so
since  July  2007.  He  emphasized  the  information  he  provided  on  his  December  2008
SF-86 was accurate, as he was not using marijuana at that time. (SOR Answer; Tr. 22-
24) Apparently, the confusion over the “continuing use” question arose when Applicant
submitted his January 29, 2019 SF-86 and estimated his marijuana use as June 2003 to
June 2017. (GE 1; Tr. 24)
Character Evidence
Applicant called one character witness (CW) to testify on his behalf, a technical
director  and  co-worker  he  has  known  since  2013.  CW  has  held  a  clearance  since
approximately 1985. CW provided a favorable professional and personal assessment of
Applicant.  She  stated  among  other  things  that  Applicant  is  trustworthy,  loyal,  and  she
has no reason to question his ability to hold a security clearance. CW did concede on
cross-examination  that  following  the  law,  rules,  regulations,  and  company  policy  is  an
important part of holding a  security clearance. CW acknowledged that  Applicant made
mistakes  and  errors  in  judgment.  That  said,  she  noted  that  he  self-reported  his
marijuana  use  and  based  on  her first-hand  knowledge  of  him  believes  that  he  will  not
repeat those mistakes. CW also submitted a reference letter. (AE 1(P); Tr. 36-48)
Applicant  submitted  performance  reviews  covering  the  years  2017  to  2020,
numerous  professional  certificates  and  awards,  and  six  reference  letters.  The
cumulative  nature  of  this  evidence  documents  that  Applicant  has  excelled  in  his
professional capacity and in that capacity has contributed to the national defense. He is
technically competent, well liked, trusted, and respected by his peers and management.
(SOR Answer; AE 1(A) – 1(P); Tr. 50-56)
