In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations, with explanations. His
admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence,
I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a federal contractor performing the duties
of a safety quality assurance specialist. He began working at his present job in October
2017. He has a high school diploma. He is married. He has two children, ages 13 and 3,
and an adult stepson. (Tr. 6, 22, 31; GE 1, 2)
Applicant served in the U.S. Marine Corps for approximately 12 years, enlisting in
August 2001  and  being  medically  retired  in 2013. He deployed  to  Iraq  as an  explosive
ordinance  disposal (EOD) technician. He suffered  combat injuries when  a  device he  was
working  on  exploded. He suffered  loss of  sight in one eye  and  various muscular injuries.
He was medically  retired  as a  result  of these  injuries.  He  receives a  military  pension  in
the   amount  of  approximately   $1,000   per  month.  He  also  receives  a   Department   of
Veterans Affairs (VA) disability  rating  and  a  monthly  payment of  approximately  $2,300.
He also received  social security  disability  payments of approximately  $2,000  per month
from  2010  until  2014.  His payments were stopped  by  the  Social Security  Administration
when  it made  a  determination  that  he  was no  longer disabled  under  its rules.  Additionally,
he   received   a   lump-sum   payment  of   $100,000   for  his  injuries  (he   did  not  specify   the
source of this payment). He admitted  “blowing” that amount fairly  quickly. (Tr. 20-24,  34-
35)
The  SOR  alleged  19  delinquent  accounts  (a  car  repossession,  a  rental  debt,
medical  debts,  and  consumer  debts)  totaling  approximately  $30,602.  The  debts  are
established  by  credit  reports  from  January  2018,  April  2019,  and  February  2021;  a
judgment related to the repossession debt; Applicant’s personal subject interview (PSI)
with a defense investigator in July 2018; and his SOR admissions. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a –  1.s)
(AE 2-6; Answer to SOR)
Applicant  explained  that  his  financial  difficulties  were  caused  after  his  medical
retirement when he and his family lived in a high-cost state from 2010 to 2014, relying on
just  his  military  pension,  his  social  security  payments,  and  his  VA  payments  for  their
income.  He  and  his  family  abandoned  their  apartment  because  of  the  high  cost  and
moved to another state in 2014. In 2017, Applicant went back to work to supplement his
income.  Before  moving  he  “foolishly”  bought  a  truck  that  was  eventually  repossessed
when  he  failed  to  make  the  payments  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  He  also  incurred  a  series  of
copayments because of his daughter’s medical situation, which he failed to pay. On his
security clearance application (SCA), he listed a large period of unemployment from 2014
to  2017,  but  he  was  receiving  income  from  his  military  pension,  his  VA  disability
compensation, and his social security disability payment during that timeframe. He has
not received any financial counseling and does not use a monthly budget. At the end of
the month, after paying all his bills and debts, he typically has a residual amount of $250.
He estimated that his 401K retirement plan has approximately $7,000 in it. (Tr. 24-25, 27,
34, 49-50; GE A)
The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a-$18,813. This debt resulted from a car repossession. Applicant opened
this loan in 2015. In November 2016 the car loan was charged off, then repossessed for
non-payment, and a deficiency balance accrued to him  of approximately $15,000. The
creditor obtained a default judgment against Applicant in May 2017 and a garnishment
order in 2019. Applicant’s pay was garnished  in the amount of approximately $970 per
month until the judgment was satisfied in December 2020. (Tr. 27, 37; GE 3, 6; AE D)
SOR  ¶  1.b-$3,445.  Applicant  incurred  this  debt  in  September  2014  when  he
abandoned  an  apartment  before  the  end  of  the  lease.  This  debt  was  assigned  to  a
collector in  December 2014.  He  has made no  attempts  to  repay this debt  This debt  is
unresolved. (Tr. 37; GE 3)
SOR  ¶  1.c-$373.  Applicant  incurred  this  consumer  debt  in  February  2016. This
debt was assigned to a collector in May 2016. Applicant claimed he called the creditor to
resolve  the  debt,  but  was  told  there  was  no  record  of  the  debt.  He  did  not  provide
supporting documentation. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 37; GE 3)
SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.h, 1.o-1.s-$441 (total). Applicant incurred these medical bills from
his  daughter’s  copayments  for  her  treatments.  He  entered  into  an  informal,  unwritten,
agreement  with  the  collection  service  holding  all  these  delinquent  medical  debts.  He
testified that he will pay the collector whenever he can and whittle the balance down. The
collector  shows  a  balance  owed  larger  than  the  SOR  amount  ($2,912).  Applicant
documented that he made one payment in August 2021 of approximately $51.  (Tr. 39,
44-45; GE 3; AEC)
SOR ¶ 1.i-$3,811. Applicant incurred this debt when he purchased a time-share
property in May 2010. He stopped making payments in November 2012 and the debt was
charged off in December 2014. Applicant testified that he felt pressured into buying the
property due to the predatory selling techniques of the property company. He claimed he
tried to cancel the contract early on, but was told he could not do so. He did not provide
supporting documentation for his claims. He does not know the current status of the debt
This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 40-41, 39; GE 3)
SOR ¶ 1.j-$1,014. Applicant opened this telecommunications account in 2013 and
it  became  delinquent  in  2016.  The  debt  was  sold  to  a  collection  service  in  2018.  He
claimed he contacted the collection company in August 2021, but was told it had no record
of him. He did not contact the original creditor. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 41-42; GE 3,
5)
SOR ¶ 1.k-no amount stated. Applicant testified that he did not know the status
of this debt. His January 2018 credit report shows a zero balance and zero amount past
due. The debt does not appear on any later credit reports. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 42;
GE 3-5)
SOR ¶ 1.l-$1,418. Applicant’s last activity on this telecommunications account was
in 2013. The debt was sold to a collection service in 2016. He has not taken any further
action to pay or otherwise resolve this debt. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 43; GE 3)
