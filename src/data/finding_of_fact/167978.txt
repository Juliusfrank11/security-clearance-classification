Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except SOR ¶ 1.g, which he denied.
He is 55 years old. He married in 1996 and has two adult children. He earned a bachelor’s
degree in 1989 and a master’s degree in 2005. As of the date of the hearing, he completed
all but the dissertation requirement towards a doctorate degree. He served honorably in
the U.S. military from 1988 to 2008, when he retired as a lieutenant commander. (Answer;
Tr. at 6-12, 30-31, 34, 46-47; GE 1, 6; AE A)
Applicant  worked  for a  previous DOD contractor from  2008  until he  was terminated
in 2014, as further discussed  below. As of  the  date  of  the  hearing  and  since  approximately
2017, he  worked  as  the  community  planning  liaison  for a  U.S. military  facility. He was first
granted  a  security  clearance  when  he  served  in  the  U.S. military.  (Answer; Tr. at  6-12,15-
18, 23-71; GE 1, 6; AE A)
The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to pay his federal and state income taxes
for tax years 2010 through 2018; failed to timely file his federal and state income taxes
for tax years 2013 through 2018; and owed approximately $40,000 in delinquent federal
and  state  taxes.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  1.c).  It  also  alleged  that  he  had  three  delinquent
consumer accounts totaling $12,810 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.g., 1.h), and two delinquent federal
debts with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) totaling $1,413 (SOR ¶ 1.e, 1.f).
The  SOR  also  alleged  that  Applicant  was  terminated  from  employment  with  a  DOD
contractor in April 2014, due to unacceptable behavior involving inappropriate touching
of employees and non-employees. The SOR allegations are established by Applicant’s
admissions  in  his  Answer,  2019  security  clearance  application  and  during  his  2019
background interviews, by the 2019 credit bureau report, court records, and employment
records. (Answer; GE 1-6)
Applicant is the primary breadwinner. His wife, who has resided overseas with their
children since 2008, previously owned a property management business that she sold in
2011,  on  the  buyer’s  condition  that  she  continue  to  run  it.  He  attributed  his delinquent
debts to  his 2014 employment  termination, the  consequent loss of  his $99,000 annual
income, and a period of unemployment through  2015. His wife, at the time, earned an
annual income of approximately $16,000. When he became re-employed in May 2015,
he started to regain control of his finances, while also financially supporting his family. As
of the date of the hearing, he testified that he paid all but one of his revolving credit cards,
to include the two alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d. and 1.h, and he intended to resolve his last
outstanding card. (Answer; Tr. at 15-18, 23-71; GE 1, 6; AE A, B)
Applicant acknowledged, however, that he had not resolved his unpaid federal and
state taxes or filed his delinquent tax returns. He stated that he needed to “. . . finalize his
tax forms, send them in, and create a payback plan.” He attributed his delinquent taxes
to having to financially support his family, and:
The  taxes, you  know, every  day  I wake  up  and  I say  I know  I should  have
filed  those,  I know  I should  have  done  that,  but it just kind  of snowballed.
The   first  time   I  did  taxes  [in   2008]  I  ended   up   owing   like   $7,000   or
something, and  it just floored  me. And  I  know  it’s not an  excuse, but  I just
got a  little bit scared  to  continue  to  do  them  and  find  out how  much  more I
owned [sic]. So it’s not an excuse; it’s just kind of  the  way it turned out.
(Tr. at 15-18, 23-71; GE 1, 6; AE A, B)
Applicant testified that the 2008 tax year was the last time he timely filed his federal
and state income tax returns. He stated that he resolved the $7,000 in federal taxes that
he owed for that tax year through a voluntary garnishment of his wages. He stated that
he untimely filed his 2009 federal and state income tax returns, and he could not recall
which tax entity garnished his wages to resolve his outstanding taxes for that year.  He
did  not  state  whether  the  garnishment  of  his  wages  was  voluntary  or  involuntary.  He
stated that he untimely filed his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2010
through 2012 in 2014. He stated that he subsequently made payments through a payment
arrangement of $300 monthly towards his state income taxes for those tax years, until the
state terminated the payment arrangement when he failed to timely file his 2013 federal
and  state  income  tax  returns.  He  stated  that  he  had  not  made  payments  towards  his
federal taxes for tax years 2010 through 2012. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c; Tr. at 15-18, 23-71;
GE 1, 6; AE A, B)
Applicant stated that he intended to file his federal and state income tax returns for
tax years 2013 through 2020 in May 2021. While he completed the tax forms as of June
2021, he had yet to mail them to his spouse for her signature, which was required before
filing them. He stated that he planned to tackle his outstanding federal and state taxes of
approximately $40,000 through a repayment plan with the IRS and the state. He stated
that he considered seeking professional tax assistance in approximately 2015, but elected
against it because he could not justify the cost when he was trying to resolve his other
delinquent consumer debts. He stated that his spouse is aware of their tax delinquencies
and his failure to file their taxes, and she admonishes him to get them done. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a,
1.b, 1.c; Tr. at 15-18, 23-71; GE 1, 6; AE A, B)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleged a $4,297 charged-off credit card. Applicant stated that he began
paying this debt in 2015.  Documentation reflects payments of $100 monthly beginning in
December 2017, and then payments of $300 monthly from February 2018 until he fully
paid this debt in September 2020. (Tr. at 25, 39-40; GE 1, 2, 6; AE A, B)
SOR  ¶¶  1.e  and  1.f  alleged  two  delinquent  debts  with  the  VA  totaling  $1,413.
Applicant paid these debts in May and December 2020. He testified that he was able to
do so with money he had available after he had resolved some of his other delinquent
debts. (Tr. at 25, 40-42; GE 2, 5, 6; AE A, B)
SOR ¶  1.g alleged  a  $195  gas bill placed  for collection.  Applicant testified  that he
intended to dispute  this debt. He learned  from one of  the  major credit reporting agencies
that this debt was for 2015  gas usage  at an  address he  had  not lived  in since  2013. As of
the  date  of the  hearing, he  had  not yet  obtained  a  copy  of his  renter’s agreement  from  his
storage or his  previous landlord so that he could submit it with his dispute. (Tr. at 25, 43-
44; GE 2, 6; AE A)
SOR  ¶  1.h  alleged  a  $8,318  charged-off  credit  card.  Applicant  testified  that  the
creditor  garnished  his  wages  at  approximately  $455  monthly  until  the  debt  was  paid.
Documentation reflects payments of approximately $455 monthly that he made directly
to  a  collection  agency  beginning  in  September  2019,  until  the  debt  was  paid  in  full  in
March 2021. (Tr. at 26, 42-44, 62; GE 1, 2, 6; AE A, B)
Applicant admitted he was terminated from employment with a DOD contractor in
April 2014, due to unacceptable behavior involving him massaging other employees’ and
non-employees’ necks. He acknowledged that, “by definition, it’s unacceptable behavior.”
He testified that he was terminated when he returned from a combined work and personal
trip, his employer told him that he had no recourse, and he chose not to sue for wrongful
termination and decided to move forward. (SOR ¶ 2.a; Tr. at 26-30, 44-46, 62-65; GE 1,
3, 6; AE A)
Applicant testified that he learned a  very important lesson from this incident,  “…
no touching in the workplace whatsoever . . ..” This was the only time he was terminated
from employment, other than when he worked for a fast-food restaurant in college. As of
the  date  of  the  hearing,  his  wife  was  unaware  of  this  termination  or  the  surrounding
circumstances. He stated that he was unconcerned if she were to find out, but “I just didn’t
need to put that extra weight on her shoulders at the time,” as her father was sick, she
was dealing with their teenage children who were acting up, and she was having difficulty
with  her  job.  He  also  stated,  “I  have  always  been  honest  about  this  incident  .  .  .”  but
acknowledged, “. . . as it is an embarrassing situation, I do not tell just anyone and keep
it to myself except in time of need and confidentiality.”  (SOR ¶ 2.a; Tr. at 26-30, 44-46,
62-65, 67-68; GE 1, 3, 6; AE A)
As  of  the date of  the hearing,  Applicant earned $124,000 annually,  he  received
$38,000 net annually from his retirement pension, and his wife earned $18,000 annually.
He has used a budget since 2017 to keep track of his finances, but stated that although
his monthly net remainder is approximately $800, they are always in the negative because
of  their delinquent debt  and the financial assistance they provide for their children.  He
sends his family about 40% to 50% of his salary, or approximately $4,000 to $7,000, each
month. Since 2018, he pays $800 monthly to rent a bedroom in a house that he shares
with three other people. He stated that with the cost of travel, he last traveled to visit his
family overseas in 2016, and they last traveled to visit him in the United States in 2008.
He had not received any financial counseling or professional tax assistance. (Answer; Tr.
