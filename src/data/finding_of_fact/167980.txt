Applicant  is  a  49-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  served  in  the
National  Guard  from  1990  to  1997,  the  U.S.  Army  from  1997  to  2002,  and  the  Army
Reserve  from  2002  to  2016.  He  is  rated  as  80%  disabled  by  the  Department  of
Veterans Affairs (VA). He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has held since
he  served  in  the  military.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree  that  he  earned  in  1997,  and  a
master’s degree that he earned in 2001. He married in 1994 and divorced in 2019. He
has three adult children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 12-15, 22-23; GE 1; AE G-I, M)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  problems,  including  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy
discharge  in  2003.  In  2007  and  again  in  2013,  the  then  U.S.  Army  Central  Personnel
Security Clearance Facility (CCF) granted Applicant’s security clearance and access to
sensitive compartmented information (SCI) with the warning that “failure to resolve your
delinquent  debts  or  other  subsequent  unfavorable  information  may  result  in  the
suspension of your security clearance.” There is no evidence that Applicant  received a
copy of the warnings. (Tr. at 25-28, 31-32; GE 3, 4, 9)
The SOR alleges six delinquent debts, including two charged-off auto loans and
a charged off credit card debt owed to the same credit union. Applicant admitted that he
owed the debts at one time, but he established that all of the debts have been settled,
paid, or otherwise resolved.
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  reduced  earnings  after  he  was
discharged from the military and a  protracted divorce. He and his ex-wife separated in
2013, but the divorce was not final until 2019. He followed his attorney’s advice and did
not resolve his debts until the court divided their assets and liabilities and ordered that
he was responsible for the three debts owed to the credit union. He was also on short-
term  disability  after  an  accident  in  2019.  (Tr.  at  16,  19-21,  24-25,  31;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE E, M)
Applicant settled the charged-off auto loan (SOR ¶ 1.a) for $5,364, with the final
payment  of  $1,964  made  in  February  or  early  March  2021.  The  SOR  alleges  the
amount  owed  was  $18,840.  That  amount  apparently  came  from  the  December  2018
combined  credit  report.  TransUnion  and  Experian  reported  that  $18,840  was  charged
off,  but  the  balance  was  reported  as  $15,327.  Equifax  reported  that  $15,327  was
charged off, with a balance of the same amount. I conclude that $15,327 was owed on
the  account  before  it  was  settled.  Applicant  settled  the  $14,330  charged-off  auto  loan
(SOR ¶ 1.b) for $2,866, which he paid in December 2020. He paid $2,190 in December
2020 to settle the $10,953 charged-off credit card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. (Tr. at 15-
17; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5, 6, 8; AE A-C)
Applicant  paid,  settled,  brought  current,  or  otherwise  resolved  the  remaining
three SOR debts, which totaled about $3,641. His finances are otherwise stable. He has
a good job with an annual salary of $135,000. He also receives disability pay from the
VA. (Tr. at 17-23, 35; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 5, 6, 8; AE D, M)
Applicant  made  three  deployments  to  Afghanistan  between  2007  and  2011.  He
submitted letters attesting to his excellent performance of duties in the military  and his
strong  moral  character.  He
for  his  dedication,  professionalism,
trustworthiness, and integrity. He was arrested in 2014 and charged with driving under
the influence and a weapons charge. He pleaded guilty to the DUI charge pursuant to a
deferred  adjudication,  and  the  weapons  charge  was  dismissed.  (Tr.  at  14,  29-32;  GE
10; AE F)
