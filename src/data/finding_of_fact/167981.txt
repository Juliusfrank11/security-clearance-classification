Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance.  Applicant  denied  generally  each  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR  with
explanations covering the financial allegations that included admissions. Findings of fact
follow.
Background
Applicant married in August 1988 and divorced in November 2002, attributable to
her husband’s cited infidelity. (GEs 1-2) She has two adult children from this marriage.
(GE 1; Tr. 32) Currently, she provides financial support to her daughter who has been
out  of  work  since  March  2021  with  a  succession  of  surgeries  (four  in  all).  (Tr.  33-35)
She earned a bachelor’s degree in June 2010 and has taken additional classes on-line
in  pursuit of  a  master’s  degree  in  business administration.  (GEs  1-2;  Tr. 38)  Applicant
did not report any military service and has never held a security clearance. (GE 1) She
is currently sponsored by her present employer for a security clearance. (Tr. 27-28)
Since January 2018, Applicant has been employed by her current employer as a
planner.  (GEs  1-2;  Tr.  38)  Between  July  2016  and  January  2018,  she  worked  for
another  defense  contractor  before  quitting  her  job  over  cited  stressful  working
conditions.  (GE  1;  Tr.  38-40)  Prior  to  July  2016,  she  was  employed  by  various  non-
defense employers. (GEs 1-2) For her reported periods of unemployment between July
2016  and  January 2018,  she did  not  collect any unemployment  benefits  and  relied  on
her savings and 401(k) retirement funds to sustain her personal needs. (GEs 1-2)
Applicant’s finances
Between  2013  and  2016,  Applicant  accumulated  delinquent federal  taxes  owed
the  IRS  for  tax  years  2013-2016.  (GEs  1-3)  Altogether,  she  accrued  over  $50,000  in
delinquent federal taxes.  Summarized,  she accrued $7,811 for 2012, $6,323 for 2013,
$6,238 for 2014, and $8,563 for 2015. GE 2; Tr. 60-61)
In  June  2015,  Applicant  entered  into  an  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS  to
pay  off  her  accrued  $1,139  in  back  taxes  for  the  covered  tax  years  of  2013-2016,  in
addition to added interest and penalties. (GE 2) From the submitted IRS transcripts for
tax years 2013-2016, Applicant was credited with $16,461 in withholding on her $31,139
in  calculated  taxes  owed  for  tax  years  2012-2015,  leaving  a  total  shortfall  of  $14,478.
For these taxes still owed, the IRS added interest and penalties that brought the amount
owed for these tax years to $50,490. (GEs 1-3)
For  the  two  years  Applicant’s  2016  installment  agreement  remained  in  force,
Applicant made no documented voluntary payments in compliance with the terms of her
IRS  agreement.  (GEs  1-3)  During  this  tax  period,  she  deferred  to  the  IRS  in  the
Service’s  attaching  of  her  credited  tax  refunds  to  fulfill  the  terms  of  her  installment
agreement.  (GEs  1-3)  Compounding  her  tax  payment  defaults  with  her  installment
agreement, Applicant was taxed on her 401(k) loans by the IRS, who treated her loans
as  withdrawals  for  tax  purposes,  after  she  reportedly  failed  to  comply  with  her  loan
repayment  terms.  (Tr.  42-43)  Claiming  she  was  placed  in  a  “non-collectible  status”
in  July  2016,  she  provided  no
following  her  exit
documentation  to  substantiate  her  claims.  (Tr.  21-22)  Further,  placement  of  her  tax
debts in a non-collectible list would not under Applicant’s cited circumstances extinguish
her debts, but would only suspend IRS enforcement by collection measures.
from  a  previous  employer
By June 2018, the IRS had restored  Applicant’s 2015 delinquent tax account to
collectible status. (GE 2; Tr. 52-53) And, in October 2018, the IRS issued a notice of a
federal tax lien filing. (GE 3) To avert potential tax levies on her earnings, she entered
into  a  second  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS  in  August  2018  to  cover  her  back
taxes owed for tax years 2013-2016. (GE 2) For several months in 2016, she complied
with the IRS’s repayment terms with monthly $300 payments. (Tr. 24) Lacking sufficient
resources  to  keep  up  with  her  monthly  IRS  payments,  she  ceased  making  her  $300
monthly payments and defaulted on her 2018 installment agreement with the IRS. (Tr.
2)
Finding in July 2019 that Applicant had failed to stay compliant with the terms of
her  2018  installment  agreement,  the  IRS  canceled  Applicant’s  installment  agreement
and placed her in a levy program. (GE 2; Tr. 56) For the past two years, Applicant has
relied  on  the  IRS’s  involuntary  attachments  of  her  approved  tax  refunds  to  cover  her
owed back taxes. (GE 3; Tr. 59-60) Since being returned to a collectible status, she has
not tried to work with the IRS on negotiating a new repayment plan, and has accepted
the IRS garnishment of her designated refunds as her chosen means of satisfying her
federal tax obligations. (Tr. 60-61)
In July 2020, Applicant was notified by the IRS that her accrued tax debts for tax
year 2014 has  been  referred to a private  collection agency.  (AE  D) While the accrued
tax  debts  for  the  remaining  years  were  not  included  in  the  collection  assignment,
presumably they remain unresolved and subject to collection enforcement as well.
Besides her IRS debts, Applicant has accumulated delinquent student loan debts
to  the  lenders  who  financed  her  college  education  (covered  by  SOR  ¶¶s  1.b-1.h  and
1.m-1.w).  (GEs  1-6;  Tr.  26-27)  Between  March  2006  and  June  2010,  Applicant
accumulated  over  $108,000  in  student  loans  to  cover  both  her  on-line  and  on-site
college courses. (GEs 2 and 4-6 and AE E; Tr. 14) These loans became delinquent in
June 2013 and have not been addressed by Applicant to date with payment or payment
plans.
While Applicant’s student  loans are currently deferred under the Cares Act, she
will need a new payment plan once the deferment expires. She continues to wait for the
disposition  of her borrower’s  defense  application  that  she  filed  in  August 2019.  (AE  E;
Tr.  13-14,  20)  Applicant’s  student  loan  delinquencies  still  total  more  than  $108,000  in
aggregate  loan  indebtedness  and  can  be expected  to  be  returned to  default  status  by
her student loan lender once her deferment expires.  (GE 2, 4-6 and AE E)
Additional delinquent debts accumulated  by  Applicant include  four medical debts
exceeding   $1,100   (covered   by   SOR   ¶¶   1.l   and   1.aa-1.cc)   and   four  consumer   debts
exceeding   $2,400   (covered   by   SOR  ¶¶.  1.i,   1.x,  1.z,  and   1.dd).  These   debts  are  well
documented   in  Applicant’s  credit  reports  (GEs   4-6),   and   were  acknowledged   by
Applicant to  belong  to  her in her PSI.  (GE 2) While they  no  longer appear on  her latest
credit report,  she  provided  no  probative  evidence  of her  own  of ever paying  these  debts
(AE  A; Tr. 74-77)  Still,  because  these  debts were not validated  in her most recent June
2021  credit  report,  Applicant  disclaimed  them  and  provided  no  assurances  that  she
would  ever  pay  them.  (AE  A;  Tr.  26-27,  74-77)  At  this  time,  these  medical  and
consumer debts remain unresolved and outstanding.
Applicant submitted  a  budget she  developed  in June  2021  that lists her monthly
expenses  totaling  $3,284  (AE  C).  She  reported  gross monthly  income  of $3,765  and  net
monthly   income   of  $939.   (AE   C;  Tr.   37)   While   working   for  a   prior  defense   contractor,
she  earned  somewhere between  $57,000  and  $60,000  a  year as a  salaried  employee.
(Tr.  40-41)   She   has   a   401(k)   retirement   account   with   an   approximate   balance   of
$26,000   (Tr.  77),  and   she   acknowledged   living   basically   “paycheck  to   paycheck.”  (Tr.
79) Applicant is credited  with  receiving  some  financial counseling; although  most of  the
counseling  described by Applicant focused  mostly on credit repair. (Tr. 70)
Applicant’s e-QIP  and PSI  omissions
Asked   to   complete   an   e-QIP   in   January   2018,  Applicant  failed   to   disclose   her
owed federal income taxes for the  previous seven  years  (i.e., for federal tax  years 2013-
2017).  (GEs  1-3) In   her 2018   e-QIP,  she   also   omitted  her current   federal taxes  owed.
Claiming   she   paid   some   federal   taxes  owed   prior   to   2018   (although   not   all),  Applicant
denied   any   knowing   and   willful  intent  to   falsify   her  e-QIP.   (Tr.   47-48)  Applicant’s
explanations   lack   sufficient  plausibility   and   credibility   to   satisfy   evidentiary   proof
requirements and  are not persuasive  enough  to  avert inferences of  knowing  and  willful
failure to list her back federal taxes owed  for tax years 2015-2016.
In  a  follow-up  PSI  with  an  OPM  investigator in  September  2018, Applicant  was
asked by the investigator whether she had any delinquent  federal debt,  she answered
“yes”  and  listed  her  federal  student  loans  without  mentioning  her  delinquent  federal
taxes.  owed.  (GE  2)  She  declined  to  provide  any  voluntary  affirmative  answers  to  the
investigator about her delinquent federal taxes, and the investigator never broached the
subject.  (GE  2;  Tr.  54-55)  Citing  her  placement  in  a  non-collectible  tax  status,  she
claimed  she  did  not  knowingly  and  willfully  omit  material  tax  information  in  her  e-QIP.
(Tr. 22-23) By the time of her PSI in September 2018, however, her non-collectible tax
status had been changed back by the IRS to a collectible status. (Tr. 55) Acknowledging
the status change, Applicant claimed she was still negotiating with the IRS over a new
repayment plan.
So, even though Applicant had not made more than a few $300 payments to the
IRS  under  her  2016  installment  agreement,  she  failed  to  acknowledge  her  delinquent
tax  debts  to  the  OPM  investigator  who  interviewed  her  in  September  2018.  (Tr.  56)
Asked why she declined to mention her change of tax status to a collectible status to the
investigator during her PSI, she declined to provide any clear explanation of her actions.
(Tr. 55)
Applicant’s claims of  a  lack of  any  practical working  knowledge  of  any  federal tax
debts  owed  when  she  completed  her 2018  e-QIP  and  when  she  later appeared  for  her
follow-up   PSI
reconcilable   with   her  hearing
acknowledgements of owing  back  federal taxes for tax  years 2013-2016. (GE 3; Tr. 22-
in  September  2018,  are   not
23)  At   no   time   before   the   hearing   did   Applicant   offer  any   corrections  to   her  tax
delinquency  omissions  or explanations for her them.  Based  on  a  thorough  review  of  the
evidence, inferences are warranted   of  Applicant’s failure to  provide  honest and  candid
answers to the OPM investigator’s inquiries about her tax delinquencies.
