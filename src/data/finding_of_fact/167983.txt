Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶. 1.a through 1.j, 1.n through 1.q, 1.r,
and 2.a. He denied the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.k through 1.m and 1.s through 1.w. After
a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 38 years old. He never married. He has a nine-year-old child. He has
worked  for  his  present  employer,  a  federal  contractor,  since  July  2018.  He  was
unemployed from November 2013 to April 2014. He attended college from 2004 to 2007.
(Item 3, 4)
Applicant completed a security clearance application in October 2018. In it he did
not disclose any delinquent debts. He disclosed that in 2016, he was made aware during
a traffic stop by police that he had an outstanding warrant. He said he was unaware of it.
The charge was for criminal mischief from an incident with a former partner. The parties
agreed that Applicant would make restitution and pay a fine, which he did. He provided
supporting  documents.  The  charge  was  dismissed.  (Items  2,  3)  (Any  derogatory
information  that  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  will  not  be  considered  for  disqualifying
purposes. It may be considered when making a credibility determination, in applying the
mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.j allege collection accounts for student loans from a state
guarantor agency. This agency purchases and administers defaulted student loans. The
total amount alleged for these student loans is approximately $18,287. Credit reports from
July 2020 and August 2019  reflect that these student loans became delinquent in July
2015, and the original creditors were banks. The credit reports do not note when these
accounts were originally opened. (Items 5 and 6)
SOR  ¶¶  1.n  through  1.q  allege  collection  accounts  from  the  Department  of
Education for student loans. The total amount alleged for these loans is approximately
$14,325.  Credit  reports  from  July 2020,  August  2019,  and  November 2018  reflect  that
these accounts were opened in 2008 and 2009 and became delinquent in 2015. (Items
5, 6, and 7)
It appears that all or some of these student loans may have been transferred or
assigned by the government to other collectors who administer the collection of student
loans, but I am unable to decipher the specific status of each loan, where it might have
been transferred, and if it was transferred more than once.
In Applicant’s February 2021 answer to the SOR, he stated that the student loans
in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.j were consolidated into a single loan and are in good standing.
He does not understand why his credit report reflects that the loans are being listed as
delinquent  with  the  state  guarantor. He  stated  that  when  he  reviewed  his  Equifax  and
Credit Karma reports the delinquent loans were not reflected under the guarantor. He did
not  provide  a  copy of  these  reports.  In his supplemental answer,  Applicant  provided a
copy of  “loan  details” from  the loan servicer from July 2021, which reflect a repayment
start date of November 2011, and the guarantor is listed as the state guarantor listed in
the  SOR. The documents  provided  are for  three  loans  with  payoff  amounts  of  $2,898;
$2,979; and $2,293. The SOR allegations are for ten loans totaling $18,287. (Items 1and
2)
In  response  to  government  interrogatories  from  May  2020,  Applicant  provided
documents for three loans reflecting they were opened in 2007 and had balances of $927,
$400,  and  $5,214.  The  payment  history  on  the  three  accounts  reflects  two  missed
payments in 2019, two missed payments in 2018, one missed payment in 2017, and five
missed payments in 2016. There is no information for 2015 and either no information for
2014 or delinquencies more than 90 days.  It is unclear if these are the same loans as
noted in his July 2021 answer. (Item 4 pages 26-28)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in January 2019. He was
confronted  with  the  delinquent  student  loans  that  were  in  collection  from  the  state
guarantor (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.j), and other delinquent debts alleged in the SOR (SOR
¶¶ 1.l-$253; 1.m - $1,484; 1.r - $628; 1.s - $190; 1.u - $661; 1.v - $576; and 1.w - $332).
He said he had no knowledge of what any of these debts were and said his identity had
been stolen in 2015 and 2016. He was confronted with DOE student loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.n
through 1.q) and said he had no federal debt and all of his student loans were current. He
said he had refinanced his DOE student loans to lower the payments. He let the loans
become  past  due  and  put  off  making  payments  because  he  was  focused  on  other
priorities at the time. He said the loans were delinquent from July 2016 to October 2016.
Applicant was confronted by the investigator with collection accounts. He explained that
they were the original carrier of the loans, which were then rolled into the DOE loans.
In Applicant’s Mary 2020 responses to government interrogatories, he said he had
placed his student loans into deferment because he was unemployed for a period and
had other financial obligations such as housing, healthcare, and basic needs. He said he
was notified by the Office of Personnel Management  in December 2014 that his social
security  number  and  other  identifying  information  were  part  of  a  data  breach.  This
happened to tens of thousands of people who worked in various capacities for the federal
government. He was provided with free credit monitoring for a year and when he noticed
a credit card had been compromised, he requested it be extended. He said he disputed
certain entries on his credit report and requested verification from other creditors. (Items
2, 4)
Applicant  provided  letters  he  sent  to  the  credit  bureaus  in  July 2021.  For  some
accounts that were not alleged in the SOR, he states he was a victim of identity theft and
he never opened the accounts. In the letter to the credit bureau regarding the debts in
SOR ¶¶ 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.s, and 1.u, Applicant provided the account name, its balance, and
the original creditor. He then stated: “I never had a contract with this debt collector for any
debt. Please provide proof from the original creditor that this debt collector owns this debt
and has the legal authority to collect it or delete this account.” In his answer to the SOR,
he stated the accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.k, 1.l and 1.u were disputed as being opened in his
name without his consent due to identity theft. His letter to the credit bureau asks that the
original creditor verify it sold the debt to a collector who now has the legal authority to
collect the debt. In his July 2021 letters, Applicant is not disputing the original debts and
does not claim the debts were incurred through identity theft. He stated he did not have
a contract with the collector, not that he never owed the debt. I did  not find Applicant’s
statements credible. I find these accounts legitimately belong to Applicant, and they are
unresolved. They are supported by entries on his credit reports.
In the letter regarding the debt in SOR ¶ 1.r, he stated: “This account was charged
off and I no longer owe money to this creditor but it’s still showing a balance due.” This
was a credit card that was opened in 2012 and defaulted on in 2014. In his February 2021
answer he stated: “I acknowledge [creditor] this matter was a compromised charge that
occurred in relation to the OPM leak. It was considered delinquent and charged off before
I received  information  from  OPM  stating  as such.” I did not find  Applicant’s statements
credible.  The  account  was  opened  in  2012,  before  the  breach.  This  account  remains
unresolved. (Items 2, 5, 6, 7)
The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.t, 1.v and 1.w are medical accounts. The debt in
SOR ¶ 1.t was incurred in December 2012 and ¶ 1.w was incurred in April 2014. Applicant
stated in his answer that he had contacted the creditors seeking information about the
debts and  questioning the  validity of  them. He  provided  no  additional information.  The
medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.v is listed in Applicant’s 2018 credit report, but does not identify
a specific creditor. It is not listed in subsequent reports. I find in his favor for this allegation.
The other debts are unresolved.
Applicant did not provide any evidence he has participated in financial counseling.
He did not provide information as to his current income, expenses, budget or financial
stability.
