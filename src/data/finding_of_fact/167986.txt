Applicant,  51,  has  worked  as  a  video-teleconference  technician  on  the  same
federal  contract  since  2004.  Since  then,  the  contract  has  been  awarded  to  several
different federal  contracting  companies.  He  has  worked  for his current  employer since
2010.  Applicant  was  initially  granted  access  to  classified  information  in  2007.  He
completed  his  most  recent  security  clearance  application  in  June  2017,  disclosing  his
failure  to  file  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for  the  2015  and  2016  tax  years.
Information  developed  during  the  investigation  revealed  that  he  failed  to  file  and  pay
federal  and  state  income  taxes  from  2015  to  2019.  This  information  is  alleged  in  the
SOR and Applicant admitted the allegations. (Tr. 15-16; GE 1-2)
When  he  completed  his  security  clearance  application,  Applicant  explained  that
he did not file his federal and state income tax returns because he did not think he owed
any taxes. He believed that the income tax withheld from his pay was enough to satisfy
his  federal  and  state  income  tax  obligations.  When  calculating  his  income  tax
obligations, Applicant failed to account for the money he won gambling at a local casino
between  2016  and  2019.  When  he  realized  in  2017  that  he  owed  federal  and  state
income  taxes,  he  became  depressed,  overwhelmed,  and  felt  paralyzed  by  the  task  of
filing his income tax returns. In his post-hearing submission, Applicant also offered that
he suffered a health scare  in 2018 that contributed to his depression and exacerbated
his financial paralysis. (Tr. 16-20; AE A)
In November 2020, Applicant hired a tax preparation company to prepare and file
his  outstanding  income  tax  returns  and  negotiate  a  payment  plan  with  the  IRS.
According to  the filed returns,  Applicant  owes  $  14,830  in federal taxes  and  $8,537  in
state  income  taxes for the  2015 to  2019  tax years.  Under the  terms  of  the  installment
agreement  negotiated  with  the  IRS,  Applicant  will  pay  $198  each  month.  In  his  post-
hearing submission, Applicant indicated that he would begin making payments soon. At
the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  received  a  loan  from  his  parents  to  satisfy  his
outstanding  state  tax  obligation  and  pay  off  his  outstanding  credit  card  debts.  By  the
time  he  submitted  his  post-hearing  documentation,  he  had  not  received  a  receipt  of
payment from the state tax authority.  (Tr. 20-23, 25; AE A â€“G)
Applicant  timely  filed  his  2020  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns.  He  earns
approximately $65,000 annually, and does not have any other source of income. He has
not gambled at the casino since 2019.  Applicant plans  to redirect the money he spent
each month on credit card payments toward the repayment of his federal tax debt and
the loan from his parents. (Tr. 24, 26; AE A, G)
