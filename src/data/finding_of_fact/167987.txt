In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations. His admissions in
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  31-year-old  employee  of  a federal  contractor.  He  graduated  from
high  school in  June  2008  and  attended a  community college  from  September 2008  to
January 2010, but he did not receive a degree. He worked in various non-federal jobs
until he was hired by his current employer in April 2019. He has never married and has
no children. He has never held a security clearance.
In  his  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  that  in  April  2011,  he  was  charged  with
misdemeanor possession of marijuana. He was convicted but the charge was reduced to
possession of paraphernalia on appeal. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail (suspended),
a $200 fine, and 12 months of supervised probation. (FORM Item 3 at 33-35.)
Applicant  also disclosed  in his SCA  that he  used marijuana between  May 2017
and January 2020. He stated that he used it once in May 2017, once in August 2017, and
twice in a state where it is legal in 2018 and 2020. He stated that his recreational use of
marijuana “became less of a want for me to do” as he “furthered in [his] career.” (FORM
Item 3 at 35) In his December 2010 response to DOHA interrogatories, he stated that he
had not used marijuana since January 2020. (FORM Item 4 at 9.)
During  an  interview  with  a  security  investigator  on  March  12,  2020,  he  told  the
investigator  that  he  purchased  marijuana  edibles  from  a  dispensary  in  a  state  where
marijuana is legal in 2018 and in January 2020. He told the investigator that he continues
to  socialize  with  two  friends  who  continue  to  use  marijuana.  He  has  not  received  any
treatment  or  rehabilitation  for  drug  use.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  will  never  use
drugs again. (Form Item 4 at 11-12.)
In  Applicant’s  response  to  interrogatories,  he  disclosed  that  he  was  cited  on
February 29, 2020 for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and failure to signal
a turn. Adjudication was deferred, and he successfully completed a diversion program,
after which the charges were dismissed and the record sealed. Although he was charged
under  a  statute  that  encompassed  driving  under  the  influence  of  drugs,  there  is  no
evidence  that  drugs  were  involved  in  this  incident.  (FORM  Item  4  at  4-7.)  He  was  on
temporary duty on a U.S. Air Force base when the incident occurred.
