In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  the  five  SOR  allegations,  with
comments in mitigation and extenuation,  which include: his failure to timely file federal
income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  (TY)  2017  and  2018  (¶  1.a);  a  $9,000  account  in
collection  for  a  delinquent  car  loan  (¶  1.b);  a  $1,284  collection  for  a  delinquent  credit
account  (¶  1.c);  a  $12,000  delinquent  child  support  debt  to  a  state  (¶  1.d);  and  a
mortgage foreclosed in 2014  (¶ 1.e). His SOR admissions, and those  in his answer to
the  FORM,  are  incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  review  of  the
record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  33  years  old.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  May  2007,  and
enlisted  in  the  U.S.  Army  in  June  2007.  He  served  honorably  until  his  discharge  as  a
specialist  (E-4)  in  April  2015.  He  then  enlisted  in  the  National  Guard-Active  Reserve
where he honorably served between April 2015 and April 2018. He possessed a secret
clearance during most of his time in the service. He attended college for a short period
in 2016, but did not earn a degree.
Between  February 2014  and  July 2016,  Applicant  worked  for  a  company  as  an
information  technology  (IT)  technician.  He  was  unemployed  between  July  2016  and
February 2017. He was hired as a security guard by a casino between February 2017
and  April  2018.  He  was  unemployed  between  April  2018  and  January  2019.  He  has
been employed with his current employer  and clearance sponsor, a federal contractor,
since January 2019.
Applicant married his first wife in 2008 and divorced in April 2016. He married his
second wife in February 2017, and they have been separated since October 2018. He
has two children, ages 12 and 14, and a step-child age 17.
In  response  to  questions  in  Section  26  (Financial  Record)  of  his  2019  SCA,
Applicant stated that he had failed to file federal and state income tax returns and to pay
taxes  for  TYs  2017  and  2018.  For  TY  2017,  he  explained  that  he  was  homeless  and
unemployed  by  April  2018,  and  had  difficulty  filing  his  taxes  without  a  residential
address. He stated he is inexperienced on what to do and plans to hire a professional to
help  him  file  his  late  income  tax  returns.  He  stated  his  intention  to  file  as  soon  as  he
gets back on his feet, and noted he had just bought the software to file his late income
tax  returns.  Regarding  TY  2018,  he  indicated  that  he  only  worked  four  months  of  the
year and he believes he did not earn sufficient income to be required to file income tax
returns.  He  also  averred  he  requested  his W2  Form  from  his  then  employers,  and  he
had not received it.
Under the IRS rules, for TY 2018, a single person under the age of 65 has to file
income  tax  returns  if  the  person  had  more  than  $1,050  of  unearned  income  (typically
from  investments),  or  had  more  than  $12,000  of  earned  income  (a  job  or  self-
employment activity) during the TY. A married person, filing jointly, would have to file if
the couple’s gross income doubled the above earnings, about $24,000.
Applicant  presented  no  documentary  evidence  to  establish  what  was  his  gross
earned income for 2018. He stated in his 2019 SCA, he was unemployed between July
2016 and February 2017.  He was a part-time drilling-reservist  with the National Guard
between April 2015 and April 2018. And, he worked full-time as a security officer for a
hotel-casino  between February 2017  and  April 2018.  He  stated  that  he  was  homeless
between April 2018 and January 2019, and lived in a shelter or out of his car. I note that
he married his second wife in February 2017, and they separated in October 2018. He
presented  no  evidence  as  to  whether  they  lived  together  while  married.  However,  he
stated in his 2019 SCA that he moved to a different state after his discharge and implied
he resided there with her during an unknown period.
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleged  a  $9,000  collection  for  a  delinquent  car  loan.  Applicant
admitted  the  allegation  and  stated  that he was  paying his child  support obligation  and
other debts before his debt for his car loan. He implied that his income was insufficient
to pay this debt until after other debts were paid. He promised to pay the debt sometime
in the near future.
SOR ¶ 1.c alleged a $1,284 collection for a delinquent credit account. In his SOR
response, Applicant stated that he had been working hard for the past few years to pay
his  debts  and  he  paid  off  this  debt  last  year.  A  July 2021  credit  report  shows  that  the
debt was paid and the account was closed. (FORM, Item 6)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleged a $12,000 collection by a state for delinquent child support. In
his SOR response, Applicant stated he had been working hard for the past few years to
pay  this  debt.  An  October  2019  credit  report  shows  that  at  some  point  in  the  past,
Applicant  was  180  days  past  due,  but as  of  the  report date, he  had  “0” past due. The
July 2021 credit report indicates Applicant “pays as agreed;” has “0” past due, and has
a scheduled payment for $638. (FORM, Item 6)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleged  Applicant  had  a  mortgage  foreclosed  in  2014.  He  explained
that  he  bought  a  home  between  2010  and  2011.  In  early-2012,  he  was  deployed
overseas and let a friend stay in the house. The friend damaged the house and moved
out without letting him know. By the time he found out about it, he was several months
behind  on  the  mortgage  payments  and  could  not  afford  the  repairs  of  the  house.  He
believed  that  his  only  option  was  to  let  the  home  go  into  foreclosure.  The  July  2021
credit  report  indicates  the  mortgage  was  foreclosed,  the  collateral  was  sold,  and  “the
balance and past due are 0”.
In   his   September 13,   2021,   response   to   the   FORM,  Applicant  stated   he   mailed
his   TY   2017   federal  income   tax   return  “a   few   weeks  ago”.  He   indicated   that   he   only
made  $865.50  in  TY  2018, and  believes he  does not have  to  file  an  income  tax  return
because   his  income   was  below   the   minimum   required   to   file.  He  further  stated   that  in
August  2021,  he   settled   the   account  alleged   in  SOR  ¶   1.b,  a   $9,000   collection   for  a
delinquent  car loan. He  also reiterated  that he  paid  off  the  accounts alleged  in SOR ¶¶
1.c and  1.d  last year.
Applicant  submitted  no  documentary evidence  to  corroborate  the above  claims,
except for the payment  of  SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d  last year, which  is corroborated by the
credit reports in evidence. (FORM, Items 5 and 6). He presented no evidence to show
he  has  participated  in  financial  counseling  or  has  a  working  budget.  Applicant  did  not
present  evidence  of  his  current  financial  situation  (gross  monthly  income,  deductions,
monthly expenses, and monthly net remainder).
Applicant told the government investigator that his financial situation was getting
better  now  that  he  was  working.  He  stated  he  was  able  and  willing  to  pay  off  his
delinquent debts and promised to be financially responsible in the future. To ensure his
financial  problems  do  not  occur  again,  he  intends  to  maintain  his  employment  and
obtain housing. Applicant was honest and upfront during the security clearance process
and  disclosed  his  tax  deficiencies  and  financial  problems  in  his  2019  SCA  and  with
government investigators.
