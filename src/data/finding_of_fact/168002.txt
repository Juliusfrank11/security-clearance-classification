The  SOR  alleges  that  the  Applicant  is  indebted  to  seven  delinquent  accounts
totaling  in  excess  of  $27,000.  Applicant  admits  all  of  the  all  debts  listed  in  the  SOR,
except 1.c.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated October 1, 2020, and June 29, 2021,
confirm the indebtedness.  (Government Exhibits 5 and 6.)
Applicant began working for his current employer in January 2020.  He has had
consistent  employment,  except  for  one  brief  period  of  unemployment  from  June  2011
until  September/October  2012.  (Government  Exhibit  3.)  Applicant  has  been  married
since  February  2015.  None  of  Applicant’s  children  reside  with  him.
(Government
Exhibit 4.)
In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  failed  to  provide  any  explanation  for  his
excessive delinquent indebtedness.  He also failed to provide any information showing
any  attempts  on  his  part  to  contact  the  creditors  and  repay  or  resolve  his  delinquent
debts.  Applicant failed to disclose any of these delinquent debts on his 2020 security
clearance application.  During his subject interview in December 2020, he discussed a
delinquent car loan and three medical accounts.
The following delinquent debts set forth in the SOR are of security concern:
1.a.  A  delinquent debt  is owed  to  a  state  department of  social service for child  support
arrearage  in the  amount of  $14,970.  Applicant had  an  active  warrant that was issued  in
January   2020   for  unpaid  child  support.    The   warrant  was  recalled   by   the   court  in
December 2020.  Applicant explained  to  the  Government investigator that  he  had  never
been   delinquent  on   child   support,  but  that  he   stopped   paying   and   had   not  paid  since
February  2019.  Applicant claims that the  notice  to appear in court and  other documents
were   sent  to   his former residence  and   he   subsequently   missed   his  court date.    At  the
time  of his DoD background  interview, Applicant  did  not intend  of  turning  himself  in on
the   warrant  because   he   did   not  have   $1,400   needed   to   be   released   from   jail.
Documentation   provided   by   Applicant   from   the   state   division   of  child   support
enforcement dated  June  25, 2021,  shows that regarding  Case  #0003720431, Applicant
has  a   current  total  balance   owed   of   $18,859.42,  with   $16,256.02   owed   to   the   parent
custodian  for support and  $2,603  owed  to  the  state.  Applicant’s monthly  child  support
payment   is  $490   which   began   in   August  2016.    (Government   Exhibit  4.)    Other
documentation   provided   by   Applicant  from   the   state   division   of   child   support
enforcement dated  June  25, 2021, shows that regarding  Case  #0003583637, Applicant
has a  current total balance  of  $14,970.81,  owed  to  the  parent custodian  and  $196  owed
to  the  state.  His monthly  payment is  $339.23  which began  in March 2013.  There  is no
evidence  in  the  record  that  shows that he  has  started  making  payments toward the  debt
yet.   (Government Exhibit 4.)
1.b.  A  delinquent  debt  is  owed  to  a  creditor  that  was  placed  for  collections  in  the
approximate amount of $8,042.  The debt remains owing.  (Government Exhibits 5 and
6.)
1.c.  A  delinquent  debt  is  owed  to  a  creditor  that  was  charged  off  in  the  approximate
amount of $2,500.  The debt remains owing.  (Government Exhibits 5 and 6.)
1.d.  A delinquent medical account was placed for collection in the approximate amount
of $938.  The debt remains owing.  (Government Exhibits 5 and 6.)
1.e.  A delinquent medical account was placed for collection in the approximate amount
of $368.  The debt remains owing.  (Government Exhibits 5 and 6.)
1.f.  A  delinquent  debt  is  owed  to  a  creditor  that  was  placed  for  collection  in  the
approximate amount of $333.  The debt remains owing.  (Government Exhibits 5 and 6.)
1.g.  A  delinquent  debt  medical  account  was  placed  for  collection  in  the  approximate
amount of $65.  The debt remains owing.  (Government Exhibits 5 and 6.)
Applicant  has  failed  to  provide  any  evidence  in  mitigation.  He  has  not  made  a
good faith effort to address his delinquent debts nor has he taken any meaningful step
to  resolve  the  delinquencies.  He  has  failed  to  show  that  he  has  made  even  one
payment  toward  resolving  his  debts.  Furthermore,  he  has  failed  to  provide  evidence
showing  that  his  current  financial  situation  is under  control  and  that  there  is no  risk  of
recurrence of the financial problems at issue.
