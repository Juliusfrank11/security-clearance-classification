Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 34 years old, and lives with her mother. She is unmarried, and has
no children. (TR at page 23 line 7 to page 26 line 9, and GX 1 at page 34.)
Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption  & Guideline  I:  Psychological Conditions
1.a.  Applicant admits that she  has consumed  alcohol, at times in excess and  to
the  point of intoxication, from  about  June  of  2004  until about September  of 2021,  “a few
weeks ago,” as admitted  at her hearing, which was  after the  issuance  of  the  SOR. She
is also an  admitted  alcoholic. (TR at  page  26  line  16  to  page  33  line  23, at  page  42  line
3 to  page  47 line 24, and at page 56 lines 1~11.)
1.b.  In  about  August  of 2013, Applicant  admits that  she  was placed  on  probation
by   Employer  A   due   to   issues   related   to   her   alcohol   abuse.   (TR  at   page   33   line   24   to
page 34 line  11.)
1.c. In about May of 2017,  Applicant  admits  that  she   received   a   written   warning
from  Employer B  for being  intoxicated  while  on  the  job.  (TR at page  34  line  22  to  page
37 line 20.)
1.d.  In   about  October  of   2017,  Applicant  was  hospitalized   as  the   result  of   an
alcohol-related incident. (TR at page 37 line  21 to  page  38 line 17.)
1.g. In  about  March of 2018,  Applicant admits that  she  was  terminated  from  her
place  of  employment,  with  Employer C, for being  under the  influence  of alcohol on  the
job. (TR at page 34 line 22 to  page 37 line 20.)
1.e.  In  about  January  of  2019, Applicant abandoned  employment at Employer D,
due  to  her misuse  of alcohol. (TR at page 38 line 18 to page  40 line  5.)
1.f. In about March of  2019, Applicant again abandoned  employment at Employer
E, due to her misuse of  alcohol. (TR at page  40 line 6 to page 41 line 5.)
1.h.  and   2.a.  In   February   of   2021,  Applicant  was   diagnosed   as  suffering   from
Alcohol   Use  Disorder,  severe,  in   sustained   remission.   (GX   3.)   Subsequent  to   this
diagnosis, she  has consumed  alcohol  “five  or six”  times; and  as such, her consumption
of  the  intoxicant  is clearly  no  longer in  remission.  (TR at  page  57  line  18  to  page  58  line
1.)
