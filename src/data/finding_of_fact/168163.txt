Applicant, age 44, has never been married nor has any children. He has resided
with  a  cohabitant  since  2013.  He received  an  associate  degree  in 1998.  He  has  been
employed  as  a  senior test  technician  by a  defense  contractor  since  January 2020.  He
was previously granted a security clearance in 2010 while employed by another defense
contractor. (Item 2; Item 3 at 2)
The  SOR  alleged  34  delinquent  debts  totaling  $118,405.  In  his  SOR  answer,
Applicant  admitted  each  alleged  debt.  The  2020  credit  report  upon  which  the  SOR
allegations were apparently based contained the following discrepancies: 1) the debt in
SOR ¶ 1.r was a duplicate of that in SOR ¶ 1.q; 2) the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.u and 1.v, as
alleged, were not established; and 3) the debt in SOR ¶ 1.z was a duplicate of that in
SOR ¶ 1.y. The following five medical debts contained in the credit report were not alleged
in  the  SOR:  $505  (acct  #  ending  in  7854);  $505  (acct  #  ending  in  7911);  $79  (acct  #
ending in 3508); $454 (acct # ending in 3197); and $173 (acct # ending in 4283). Any
debts not alleged in the SOR will only be considered to evaluate mitigation and the whole-
person  concept.  According  to  his  2020  credit  report,  Applicant  incurred  35  delinquent
debts  totaling  $118,711,  including  29  medical  accounts  totaling  $103,941;  three  utility
accounts totaling $1,429; two automobile-loan accounts totaling $13,159; and one $172
car insurance account. (Items 1, 4)
Applicant  attributed  his  medical  debts  to  expenses  he  incurred  after  he  was
transported  via  ambulance  to  hospitals  in  January  2015  and  January  2017  following
seizures of unknown origin. The duration of his respective hospital stays was “a couple
of  days”  in 2015 and one day  in  2017.  He did not have  health insurance during either
stay. He maintained that he also did not have any other ability to pay  those expenses.
Applicant does not plan to pay any of the medical debts alleged in the SOR because he
believes  that  he  was  overcharged.  He  asserted  that  he  last  received  a  call  from  a
collection company about a medical debt in 2018, but he did not answer. Thereafter, he
blocked calls that he received from collection companies. (Item 2 at 31-32; Item 3 at 3-4)
Applicant  asserted  that  his  home  state  does  not  require  employers  to  provide
health insurance to employees, and he chose not to purchase it himself because it was
too expensive. He claimed that he was deliberately overcharged by the hospitals so that
they could sell his debts to collection agencies and then  take the tax write-off. He also
asserted that he received limited services during his hospital stays; specifically, that his
basic vitals were monitored, but he received no other services because he did not have
insurance or other means to pay his bill. Although he could not recall the details of his
bills,  he  believed  that  the  majority  of  his  medical  debts  related  to  his  2015  stay.  He
estimated that he was billed about $3,000 for his 2017 stay. While he did not recall how
much he was billed for his 2015 stay, he believed that he should have only been charged
about $800 because he did not undergo any tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) scans. Applicant did not provide any documents corroborating his claims. (Item 2
at 31-32; Item 3 at 3-4)
Applicant did not provide any details about the three utility debts alleged in SOR
¶¶ 1.c through 1.e, nor did he proffer a plan to repay them. According to his 2020 credit
report, collection companies were assigned the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c. and 1.e in
December  2012  and  June  2017,  respectively.  The  creditor  charged  off  the  account
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d in September 2012. (Item 4 at 10, 16)
Applicant provided details on only one of the two car-loan debts that were alleged
in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.hh. He asserted that the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b related to a 2013
Ford Escape that he financed in January 2015. He claimed that he was forced to accept
a predatory interest rate for the loan because he needed a car for transportation to work.
He explained that, after timely making payments on the loan for about six to eight months,
he voluntarily surrendered the car because his girlfriend’s family had given him another
car  for  free  and  he  no  longer  needed  the  Ford  Escape.  He  also  “no  longer  wanted  to
continue expensive payments.” He does not plan to repay this debt. He stated: “The loan
was predatory  and  there is nothing  for me  to  gain by  paying  it.” According  to  his 2020
credit  report,  a  collection  company  was  assigned  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  in
February 2018, and the creditor charged off the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.hh in February
2014.  He did  not address  whether he planned to pay the debt alleged  in SOR ¶ 1.hh.
(Item 2 at 31; Item 3 at 3; Item 4 at 10, 16)
Applicant did not provide any details about the car-insurance debt alleged in SOR
¶ 1.a, nor did he proffer a plan to repay it. According to his 2020 credit report, a collection
company was assigned this debt in February 2019. (Item 4 at 9)
Applicant  described  his  financial  situation  optimistically  during  his  July  2020
security clearance interview. He stated that he was doing very well financially because
he was current with all of the bills for which he felt responsible, including his taxes.  He
attributed his medical and car-loan debts to price gouging and predatory practices, and
not to any irresponsibility on his part. He stated that he no longer had a car and, instead,
rode a bike to work. At that time, he did not use credit cards or make purchases on credit
because of his credit history. He indicated that he planned to try to clean up his credit in
the next few years. He also averred that he might file for bankruptcy at some point, but
acknowledged that he had not yet taken any steps to do so. (Item 3 at 5)
Applicant  did  not  proffer  any  details  or  corroborating  documents  concerning  his
relevant income and expense history or his ability to repay his debts. The record did not
indicate whether he had any financial counseling. He has been steadily employed since
at  least October 2009, with  the exception of  one two-week  period of  unemployment in
November 2016, after he was terminated by his then employer. He denied that he was
terminated for cause and is not eligible for rehire. He claimed that, because his work as
a graphic designer was boring and repetitive, he requested to be terminated so that he
could  collect  unemployment,  which  his  supervisor  obliged.  During  that  period  of
unemployment,  he  was  supported  by  unemployment  compensation  in  an  amount  not
specified. (Item 2 at 12-16; Item 3 at 1-2)
