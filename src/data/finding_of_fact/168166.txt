In his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.i, all with explanations.
His admissions and explanations are included in the findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant is 48 years old.  He was certified as an emergency medical technician
(EMT) in 1997. (Item 3 at 9) He has been working as a security officer for a government
contractor  at  a  U.S.  government  agency.  He  has  held  the  same  job,  with  different
employers, with a security clearance, since 2005. (Item 3 at 10-11, 25; AE H)
On his October 2016 SCA, Applicant disclosed several delinquent debts. (Item 3
at  26-28)  He  discussed  his  debts  in  his  August  2017  background  interview.  (That
interview summary references debts likely listed on a contemporaneous credit report that
is not in the record). All of  the SOR debts are listed on an October 2019 credit report,
though one debt is listed as transferred or sold, with a zero balance. (Item 5)
On  his  SCA,  Applicant  did  not  indicate  that  he  had  ever  been  married.  In  his
background  interview,  he  noted  that  he  had  begun  a  “spouse-like”  relationship  with  a
cohabitant.  (Item  4  at  3)  In  his  SOR  Response,  Applicant  noted  that  he  had  recently
“separated from [his] wife,” and intended to downsize until he made ends meet. (Item 2)
He included a March 2021 final divorce order with his FORM response. (Item A). It reflects
that  Applicant  and  his  wife  married  in  September  2017,  and  last  cohabitated  in  early
March 2019. The divorce petition was filed by his wife. (Item A).
In his FORM Response, Applicant said he had paid off most of his debts and was
working on the rest. The financial impact of his recent divorce is unclear. Applicant and
his former wife had divided their marital assets before the divorce was finalized, and they
mutually agreed to be separately responsible for their individual debts, none of which are
detailed in the divorce decree. (AE A)
Applicant’s debts predate his divorce. He indicated in his background interview that
he fell behind on his debts when he gave money to his parents when they were in financial
need.  (Item  4)  The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  incurred  just  under  $37,000  in
delinquent debt. (Item 1) The debts are listed on an October 2019 credit report. (Items 2,
5).
SOR ¶ 1.a is a $17,647 debt placed for collection. Applicant settled the debt for
$6,176  in  April  2021  and  provided  verifying  documentation.  (FORM  Response;  AE  D)
This debt is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b ($5,316) is a debt placed for collection by a bank. Applicant said he
planned to pay it but noted that he had not received a settlement offer. This debt is still
listed on a current credit report. (Item 6) This debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c ($2,896) is a debt placed in collection by a consumer account or a bank.
Applicant said he received a settlement offer but had not addressed it. He planned to pay
a small amount off each month. This debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.d ($2,281) is a debt placed in collection by a phone company. Applicant
asserts that the debt relates to an allegation from the creditor that he did not return certain
equipment. Applicant intended to  resolve  the debt  with  his tax refund. This debt is not
resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.e ($1,803) is a debt placed in collection by a bank. Applicant intended to
resolve  the debt once he paid  his taxes.  (Item 2) This debt remains  listed on a  recent
credit report. (Item 6) This debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.f  ($1,285) is a  debt  placed  in  collection  by a  bank.  Applicant  provided
documentation with his FORM Response that the debt was resolved by garnishment in
July 2018. (FORM Response; AE B) Although the debt remains listed on a recent credit
report (Item 6), it is nonetheless resolved.
SOR ¶  1.g  ($1,095) is a  debt placed  in collection  by  a  phone  company. Applicant
provided  documentation  with  his FORM  Response  that the  account has been  paid.  (AE
C) The debt is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.h ($472) is a past-due medical debt. Applicant was not initially aware of
the  debt  until  his  interview  but  said  he  will  pay  it.  It  remains  listed  as  unpaid  on  a
September 2021 credit report. (Item 6) This debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.i ($4,167) is a debt that has been charged off. Applicant admits the debt
and said he would pay it. The debt is listed on Item 5, his October 2019 credit bureau
report, as having been transferred or sold, but the creditor is not identified, and no balance
is listed. The debt is not listed on a more recent credit report, Item 6. As no balance is
indicated, the debt is considered resolved.
Applicant’s September 2021  submissions  included  a  narrative  statement about his
expenses and  debt repayment  plan. (AE  E) He pays $650  a  month  in rent, has a  $700
monthly  car payment,  pays $264  in insurance, $86  for a  cell  phone, and  about $215  for
cable  and   internet,   expenses  totaling   $1,915   per  month.  Other  basic  monthly   staples,
such as food, utilities, and gas for his car, are not noted. (AE E) He included  a bimonthly
paystub  for August 2021. He  earned  gross income  of about $2,921, and  net income  of
about  $2,088   bimonthly   (or  $4,176   per  month).  (AE   F)   For  2021   to   that   point   (eight
months), he  had  earned  a  gross total income  of  about $46,055. (AE  F)  This suggests a
total annual gross income  for 2021 of just over $69,000. ($46,055 divided by 8 months =
$5,756.87, and $5,756.87 times 12  months = $69,082.50).
In September 2021, Applicant indicated that he had $7,054 with which to pay his
remaining debts (the “full amount”) by the end of November 2021, instead of paying $258
per month for three years. He also said that he planned to refinance his auto. (AE E)
Given  this  representation  from  Applicant,  I  reopened  the  record  again,  on
November 16, 2021, until November 30, 2021, to allow him to submit documentation of
any  additional  payments  towards  his  SOR  debts.  (HE  III)  The  same  day,  Applicant
responded  and  reported  that  in  early  October  2021,  he  had  been  injured  in  an  auto
accident. He said that his injuries have left him unable to work at least for the time being,
as  he requires  digital dexterity to  fire a  weapon  in  order  to  work as  an armed  security
guard.  His  post-accident  medical  treatment  is  ongoing;  it  will  be  followed  by  physical
therapy as he attempts to qualify to return to his job. He is currently out of work, with no
short-term or long-term disability. His repayment plan for his SOR debts is therefore on
hold, as his savings are used for his everyday bills. (AE H)
Applicant  provided  two  reference  letters  from  co-workers.  (AE  G)  Both  of  them
attest  that  Applicant  had  been  employed  as  a  full-time  security  police  officer  at  a
government  facility  since  about  2004.  He  is  a  valued  and  highly  knowledgeable  team
member and has significant tenure in the job. He often volunteers for extra duty. He is a
good and supportive friend and a good colleague. (AE G) He also provided a letter from
his landlord, who notes that Applicant pays on time, is a quiet occupant, and is a “stellar
renter.” (AE G)
