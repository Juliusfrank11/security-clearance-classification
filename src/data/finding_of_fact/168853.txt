Applicant denied all the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  28  years  old.  He  has  a  job  offer  from  a  defense  contractor,  but  is
currently unemployed. He  is  not married, but  has one  child. (TR at  page 19  line  14  to
page 25 line 1.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a. Applicant denies that he has a past-due debt to Creditor A in the amount of
about  $1,587.  (TR  at  page  25  line  18  to  page  26  line  12.)  He  has  submitted
correspondence  from  Creditor  A  confirming  that  Applicant  does  not  owe  this  debt.
(AppX B.)
1.b. Applicant denies that he has a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of
about  $963.  (TR  at  page  27  line  2  to  page  29  line  19.)  He  has  submitted
correspondence  from  a  credit  reporting  agency  averring  that  this  “Disputed  item  [has
been] deleted” as being past due. (AppX C.)
1.c.   Applicant  denies  that   he   has  a   past-due   college   debt  to   Creditor  C  in   the
amount of about $11,720; however, it does appear on Applicant’s October 2019 credit
report.   (GX   3   at   page   4.)   He  avers  that  Creditor  C   made   false   promises   as   to   post-
college  employment. (TR at page  29  line  24  to  page  35  line  5.) Applicant has submitted
correspondence   from   a   “Debt  Collector”   that   it  “is  not  currently   handing”  this  account
(PHX   A);   but   that   does  not  “rule   out”   the   fact  that  another  debt   collector  may   be,  and
that this large past-due debt is still outstanding.
1.d.  Applicant  denies that he  has  a  past-due  debt to  Creditor D in  the  amount of
about $3,114; however, it does appear on Applicant’s October 2019 credit report (GX 3
at page  5).   (TR at page   33   lines   6~14,   and   at   page   35   lines   8~24.)  He   has   submitted
nothing further in this regard.
1.e.   Applicant   denies   that   he   has  a   past-due   medical   debt   to   Creditor  E   in  the
amount  of  about  $3,114;   however,  it  does  appear  on   Applicant’s   October  2019   credit
report (GX   3   at page  5). (TR at   page  36   line   1   to   page  40   line   12.) He  has  submitted
nothing further in this regard.
1.f. Applicant initially denied that he has a past-due medical debt to Creditor F in
the amount of about $165; however, it does appear on Applicant’s October 2019 credit
report (GX  3  at page  5). (TR at  page  36  line  1  to  page  40  line  12.)  He has  now  set up  a
payment plan to address this past-due debt.  (PHX C.)
1.g. Applicant initially denied that he has a past-due medical debt to Creditor G in
the  amount  of  about  $1,379;  however,  it  does  appear  on  Applicant’s  October  2019
credit report (GX 3 at page 5). (TR at page 36 line 1 to page 40 line 12.) He has  now
submitted documentation verifying this past-due debt is his, but nothing more. (AppX G,
and PHX D.)
1.h.  Applicant  denies  that  he   has  a   past-due   medical  debt  to   Creditor  H  in  the
amount   of  about  $4,128;   however,  it  does  appear  on   Applicant’s   October  2019   credit
report (GX   3   at page  5). (TR at   page  36   line   1   to   page  40   line   12.) He  has  submitted
nothing further in this regard.

about  $231.  (TR  at  page  40  lines  13~20.)  He  has  submitted  documentation  showing
that this balance is now “$0.00.” (AppX E.)
1.j.  Applicant  denies  that  he  has  a  past-due  motor  vehicle  debt  to  Creditor  J  in
the amount of about $13,667. (TR at page 40 line 25 to page 42 line 13, and at page 44
lines  6~12.)  He  has  submitted  documentation  showing  that  this  balance  is  now  “$0.”
(AppX E.)
