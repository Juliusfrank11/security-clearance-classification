Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 56 years old. He immigrated to the United States in 1987. He had no
family here at the time. He attended college on and off until he graduated in 1998 with a
bachelor’s degree. He suspended his college studies due to his finances. Due to learning
English while in college, it was more difficult for him. He married in 1993. He became a
citizen in 1997 and has a daughter from the marriage who recently completed her college
degree. (GE 1; Tr. 39-48)
Applicant  funded  his  college  studies  through  student  loans.  In  1998,  he  began
working at a car rental agency earning approximately $28,000 annually. His wife did not
work  from  1993  to  1999.  She  began  attending  community  college  in  1999.  In  2000,
Applicant  began  getting  behind  in  repaying  his  student  loans.  His  elderly  parents  had
immigrated to the United States in 2000 and were living with him. They lived with him until
2016. They are now in a senior facility, and he provides monthly support for them. In 2001,
Applicant filed bankruptcy and had his debts discharged, except for his student loans. No
other debts are alleged in the SOR, except his student loans. (Tr. 39-50, 111-112; GE 5)
From  1998  to  2010,  Applicant  continued  to  work  at  the  car  rental  agency.  He
completed courses and earned certificates in his area of study. In 2010, Applicant found
a job in his field. His wife also graduated from college and started working in 2012. From
2010 to 2015, Applicant worked for private companies. In 2015, he began working on a
government contract. (Tr. 48-54; AE AA)
Applicant  credibly  testified  that  after  he  graduated  from  college,  he  made  the
minimum payments towards his student loans for two years. He then continued to make
payments. The amount was less than the minimum payment required, but was what he
could  afford  at  the  time.  He  testified  his  payments  were  consistent,  but  he  skipped  a
couple  payments  in  2013.  In  2015,  he  began  earning  more  money  and  increased  his
payments, but was not caught up. He provided documents to show the payments he made
from 2013 through January 2021. (Tr. 54-57, 67-68, 103-105; Answer; AE O. P, Q)
In  2017,  Applicant’s  daughter  began  attending  college.  She  received  a  partial
scholarship, but Applicant and his wife paid the remaining balance. His wife’s income was
allocated for their daughter’s college expenses. His daughter graduated this year and will
apply to medical school after taking a gap year. Applicant testified that his daughter will
be responsible for her graduate school expenses. (Tr. 61-64)
In 2016, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) and did not
disclose he was behind on his student loans. He testified that he thought because he was
making  payments  he  did  not  have  to  disclose  the  student  loans.  He  said  the  financial
section of the SCA had things that did not apply to him and because the questions were
grouped  together  he  believed  he  was  answering  correctly.  He  was  aware  that  the
background investigation process would access his credit reports. He was not interviewed
by a government investigator as part of his background investigation.  Because he was
granted  a  security  clearance,  he  believed  there  were  no  issues  regarding  his  student
loans and his response. I found his testimony credible. (Tr. 58-61, 64-68, 93-98; AE CC)
In April 2019, Applicant completed another SCA. He did not disclose he had any
delinquent debts in his SCA. He was interviewed by a government investigator in January
2020.  He  explained  that  he  thought  he  only  had  to  disclose  debts  that  were  being
garnished. He credibly testified that he believed because he was making payments on
his student loans he did not have to disclose them. He explained that there were so many
subsections to the different questions he did not have a clear understanding and thought
if he answered “yes” he was admitting all of the categories. He did not want to say “yes”
because many things did not apply to him. He believed because he was making monthly
payments, he was not delinquent. English is a second language for Applicant. (Tr. 64-68,
98-100; GE 1, 4)
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation in ¶ 2.a that alleged
he deliberately failed to disclose his delinquent student loans on her 2019 SCA. Applicant
testified that he initially was going to deny the allegation. He then sought advice from his
employer’s corporate attorney on how to answer and was advised it was better to respond
“yes” and then provide an explanation. This attorney did not have experience in security
clearances. Applicant believed he received incorrect advice. The attorney acknowledged
her inexperience in the area of security clearances and referred Applicant to his present
attorney. When he responded, he did not think he was admitting that he deliberately failed
to  provide  accurate  information.  I  found  Applicant’s  explanations  credible.  I  believe  he
made  an  honest  mistake,  received  incorrect  advice,  and  did  not  deliberately  fail  to
disclose the status of his student loans. (Tr. 99-103; Answer to SOR)
Applicant  testified  that  in  February  2020,  after  his  background  interview,  he
contacted the Department of Education (DOE) regarding bringing his loans current. He
was told he could pay the total amount owed or participate in a rehabilitation program. It
took  months  for  his  rehabilitation  program  to  be  approved.  He  continued  to  make  his
payments  while  waiting  for  DOE  to  respond.  His  application  was  approved  in  January
2021. He is to make payments of $796 a month. He made his first payment in January
2021, and also paid an additional $250. He was advised in February 2021 that his loans
were rehabilitated and transferred to a new loan servicer. DOE would contact the credit
bureaus  to  delete  the  record  of  default  from  his  credit  report.  Due  to  the  COVID-19
pandemic, student loan payments were in forbearance from March 2021 until September
2021.  It  was  extended  in  September  2021  until  January  2022.  Applicant  resumed
payments in May 2021 and has made them consistently as required, even though he is
entitled to have the loans in forbearance. (Tr. 69-84; GE 2, 3, 6; AE A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
H, I, J, K, L, T, V, W, Z)
Applicant provided a copy of his current budget, which includes his student loan
payments. He also provided receipts to show he is timely paying his monthly expenses.
(AE X) He provides his parents $350 to assist with their expense. Applicant recently took
classes so he could become certified as a title insurance inspector and earn additional
income. He has been working in this part-time capacity for about four or five months. He
earns about $400 to $600 a month in this job. His wife has about $15,000 in savings and
he has a pension account with about $16,000 in it. Now that his daughter has graduated
from college, his expendable income has increased, and he is more secure financially.
He intends to repay his student loans and will do so regardless of his security clearance
status. (Tr. 84-92; 114-115; AE X, DD)
Character  witnesses  testified  on  Applicant’s  behalf.  Both  have  held  security
clearances for many years and have worked with Applicant. They opined that he is honest
and truthful and is respected by his coworkers. He has a high level of integrity. Both noted
that because English is a second language sometimes it takes him longer to understand
certain words. (Tr. 22-39)
Character   letters  from   people   who   have   known   him   for   many   years  attest   to
Applicant’s  honesty,  truthfulness,   and   integrity.  He  is a  model coworker and   employee
who  is careful and  meticulous regarding  his work. He is a  valued  employee  who  has a
strong work ethic and  a loyal commitment to  his family. (AE BB)
