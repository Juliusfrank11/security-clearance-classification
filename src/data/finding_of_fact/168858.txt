Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  62-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  1989.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance
since about 1985. He is married, and has two children. (TR at page 12 line 1 to page 13
line 16.)

2.a. Applicant used  marijuana, about  once  or twice a  month, from  about January
of  2007  until December of  2009, while  granted  access to  classified  information. (TR at
page 13 line  20 to page 14  line 25.)
2.b.  Applicant  used  cocaine,  on  two  occasions,  during  the  period  from  about
January of 2007 until December of 2009, while granted access to classified information.
(TR at page 15 lines 1~14.)
Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
1.b.   Applicant   falsified   his  November   2011   SF-86,  in   answer  to   Section   23,  by
failing  to  disclose  his  drug  involvement, noted  above. (TR at  page  22  line  24  to  page  24
line  12, and GX 1  at page 22.) I find this falsification  to  be willful.
