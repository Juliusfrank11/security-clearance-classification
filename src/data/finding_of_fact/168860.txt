Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d~1g, 1.i, and 1.k~1.x. He
denied SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.h, and 1.j. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  47-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  April  of  2020.  He  is  divorced,  and  has
custody of  his three  children.  (TR at  page  11  line  23  to page  13  line  18,  and  GX 1  at
page 7.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.d. Applicant filed for the  protection of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in November of
2013  and  his  debts  were  discharged  in  February  of  2014.  This  filing  was  a  result  of
Applicant being  “laid off” from  his employment.  (TR at  page  13  line  24  to  page  15  line
6.)
1.a.~1.c.  Applicant  has  submitted   documentation   showing   he   has  paid  his
delinquent  taxes for  tax  year 2015,  and  is current with  his  Federal and  state  income  tax
filings. (TR at page  15  line  12  to  page  20  line  5, Answer at page  6, and  AppX  A.) These
allegations are  found  for Applicant.
1.e.   Applicant  admits  that   he   has   a   past-due   debt,   as  the   result  of   a   jewelry
purchase, to  Creditor E  in the  amount of about $1,801. (TR at page  20  line  8  to page  21
line  6, and  at page  22  line  13  to  page  23  line  8.)  As  this  debt  also  appears as  past-due
on   the   Government’s  most   recent,   August  2021,   credit   report  (GX   6   at  page   2),   this
allegation is found against Applicant.
1.f.     Applicant   has   submitted   documentation   showing   he   settled   and   paid  the
alleged  $799  past-due debt  to  Creditor  F. (TR at page 21  line 7  to page  22  line  12.) This
allegation is found  for Applicant.
1.g.  Applicant  admits   a   $2,788,   past-due,   motor  vehicle   debt,   the   result   of   a
repossession.  (TR  at   page   23   line   9   to   page   24   line   14.)  The   debt   appears  on   the
Government’s most recent,  August 2021,  credit report.  (GX  6  at  page  4.)  This allegation
is found against Applicant.
1.h. Applicant in his Answer denied; but at his hearing  he  now  admits, a  $6,404
past-due  debt to  Creditor H. (TR at page  24  line  15  to  page  26  line  1.)  Despite  having
nearly   three   months  to   do   so,  Applicant  has  submitted   nothing   in  this  regard.   This
allegation is found against Applicant.
1.i.  Applicant   has  submitted   documentation   showing   he   settled   and   paid  the
alleged  $4,483  past-due  debt to  Creditor I. (TR at page 26  line  2  to page  27  line  9.) This
allegation is found  for Applicant.
1.j.  Applicant   denies  and   formally   disputed   an   alleged   $2,232   past-due   debt   to
Creditor  J.   (TR   at  page   27   line   10   to   page   28   line   23.)   As   this   alleged   debt  does   not
appear on  the  Government’s most recent,  August 2021, credit report, this allegation  is
found  for Applicant.
1.k.  Applicant  avers he  paid  an  alleged  $1,437  past-due  debt  to  Creditor K. (TR
at  page   28   line   24   to   page   30   line   2.)  As  this  alleged   debt   does  not   appear  on   the
Government’s  most  recent,  August  2021,  credit  report,   this  allegation   is  found   for
Applicant.
1.l. Applicant has  submitted  documentation  showing  that his current balance  due
to  Creditor L  is “$0.00.” (TR at page  30  line  3  to page 31  line 6,  AppX  D.)  This allegation
is found  for Applicant.
1.m. Applicant avers he  has settled  an  admitted  $875  past-due  debt to  Creditor
M.  (TR  at  page   31   lines  7~21.)  Despite   having   nearly   three   months  to   do   so,   he   has
submitted nothing  in this regard.  This allegation is found against Applicant.
1.n. Applicant has submitted documentation  showing that his current balance due
to  Creditor N is “$0.00.” (TR at page  31  line  22  to   page  32  line  14., and  AppX  E) This
allegation is found  for Applicant.

full” his nine, past-due, medical debts.  (TR at page  32  line  15  to  page  34  line  13, and
