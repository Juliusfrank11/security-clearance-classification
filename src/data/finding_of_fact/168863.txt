In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 56-year-old native of Yemen. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1989
from a university in Yemen. He came to the United States in August 1983 under a cultural
exchange  scholarship and attended a U.S.  university.  (FORM Item 4 at 3.)  He  earned
three master’s degrees and a doctorate from a U.S. university in 2005.
Applicant  married  in 2000, divorced  in 2006, and  remarried  in 2014. He became  a
U.S. citizen  in 2011. His wife  is a  citizen  of  Yemen  and  a  permanent resident of  the  United
States. (FORM  Item  4, Subject  Interview  at  8.)  He has two  adult  children  from  his first
marriage   and   a   two-year-old  daughter   from   his  current  marriage,  who   is  a   native-born
U.S. citizen.  His two  adult children  were born  in  the  United  Arab  Emirates and  are  citizens

Applicant applied for a security clearance in 2011, but his application was denied.
During his counterintelligence-focused screening interview, he told the interviewer that he
believed his application was denied because of money he sent to his brother and nephew
in Yemen. (FORM Item 4 at 10.)
Applicant’s mother and father are deceased. (FORM Item 3 at 32-33.) His older
brother,  one  half-sister,  two  stepmothers,  mother-in-law,  and  father-in-law  are  citizens
and  residents  of  Yemen.  Another  half-sister  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Djibouti.  His
younger brother is deceased. (FORM Item 3 at 35-36, 41-42; FORM Item 6.)
Applicant has regular contact with his older brother about twice a week. (FORM
Item 4, subject interview at 6.) He had occasional contact with his stepmother while his
father was alive, but virtually no contact since his father passed away in 2017. (FORM
Item  3  at  35.)  He  has  contact  with  his  other  stepmother  only  when  he  visits  Yemen.
(FORM Item 3 at 40.) He has weekly contact with his two half-sisters. (FORM Item 3 at
42-43.) He has telephonic contact with his father-in-law three or four times a year. (FORM

financial  status  as  “stable,”  and  told  the  interviewer  that  he  was  “doing  very  well.”  His
credit report reflected no derogatory information. (FORM Item 5 at 14.) He provided no
other information about his financial assets.
I have taken administrative notice that the United States has had a long on-and-
off  relationship  with  Yemen,  due  to  internal struggles  for power  in  Yemen.  The  United
States established diplomatic representation in North Yemen in 1959 and in South Yemen
in  1967.  Military leaders in  North  Yemen  overthrew the  monarchy and  established  the
Yemen  Arab  Republic,  which  the  United  States  recognized  in  1962.  The  Yemen  Arab
Republic severed relations with the United States in 1967 in the wake of the Arab-Israeli
conflict. Diplomatic relations with the Yemen Arab Republic were reestablished in 1972.
North  Yemen  and  South  Yemen  temporarily  reunified  in  1990,  and  the  United  States
established relations with the united country.
A  civil  war  broke  out  in  1994  over  reunification  issues.  After  reunification,  Ali
Abdullah Saleh, the former president of the Yemen Arab Republic, was elected president
of  the  unified  Yemen.  President  Saleh  stepped  down  in  early  2011,  and  Abdo  Rabo
Mansour Hadi was elected president for a two-year transition period in February 2012,
Yemen’s peaceful political transition ended in 2014, when the Houthis seized control of
the  government  and  forced  the  established  government  into  exile  The country remains
deeply divided, with pockets of ongoing violent conflict. The Houthis continue to control much
of the northwest, including Yemen’s capital city, Sana’a. Meanwhile, the legitimate Republic
of Yemen Government (ROYG) re-established a presence in southern Yemen, including the
port city of Aden. Amid rising tensions between the Houthis and ex-President Saleh, sporadic
clashes  erupted  in  mid-2017,  and  Houthi  forces  killed  Saleh  in  early  December  2017.
Beginning in June 2018, ROYG forces, supported by their coalition partners, have sought to
wrest control from Houthi forces occupying the port of Hudaydah on the Red Sea. Houthi
forces  have  launched  multiple  rocket  and  ballistic  missile  attacks  into  the  territory  of  the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and toward Red Sea shipping lanes, further increasing tensions in
the region.
The ongoing conflict has exacerbated already high levels of need in Yemen, pushing
the country to a humanitarian crisis. The UN estimates that more than 24 million people,
or nearly 80 percent of the entire population, are in need of humanitarian assistance, more
than any other single country today. The U.S. government provided more than $630 million
in humanitarian assistance to Yemen in fiscal year 2020 and supports a small number of
health, education, and recovery assistance activities to help households and social service
delivery  systems  cope  with  the  effects  of  the  conflict  and  prepare  for  the  post-conflict
recovery.  However,  the  insecure  operating  environment  and  ongoing  bureaucratic
impediments continue to limit development programming.
Yemen  has  significant  human  rights  issues.  Impunity  of  security  officials  is  a
problem, in part because the government exercised limited authority and in part due to
lack  of  effective  mechanisms  to  investigate  and  prosecute  abuse  and  corruption.  The
United States suspended diplomatic operations in Yemen in February 2015, and the U.S.
Ambassador to Yemen maintains diplomatic engagement with Yemen from Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia. Yemen maintains an embassy in the United States. The U.S. State Department
has issued a Level 4 (Do not Travel) warning for Yemen, due to terrorism, civil unrest,
health risks, kidnapping, armed conflict, and landmines.
