Applicant  admitted  all  but  one  of  the  SOR  allegations,  with  explanations.  His
admissions are incorporated into these findings of fact.  After a review of the pleadings
and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since 2017. He has been promoted several times while working for
this  contractor.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  on  active  duty  for  15  years  and  was
honorably discharged in late 2016 as a staff sergeant (E-5). He was separated because
of not making promotion to the next rank, E-6. He was unemployed for about one year
after his military separation. He receives service-connected disability payments from the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) rated at 80 percent. He has an associate’s degree.
He has been married for 17 years and has two children, ages 19 and 15. (Tr. at 7, 27-30)
The SOR alleged that Applicant had four charged-off debts, a foreclosure, and a
judgment totaling approximately $30,494. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f) The debts are established by
Applicant’s admissions, court documents, and entries on several credit reports. Two of
the listed SOR debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and1.f) refer to the same underlying debt. I will consider
only one debt and find for the Applicant on the duplicate debt (See GE 8, p. 2, entry 1).
(GE 3-10; Answer to SOR)
By his own admission, Applicant’s financial difficulties were partly caused by his
family living outside their means when he was in the Air Force. He essentially lived on the
same  pay  for  about  11  years  because  of  his  lack  of  promotion.  Additionally,  his  wife
suffers from a bipolar disorder. When he was deployed to a combat zone. she fell into a
depressive state and self-medicated by going on spending binges, while simultaneously
neglecting the family household finances.  His  year of  unemployment in 2017, after his
discharge, also contributed to his financial problems. (Tr. at 28, 31; AE 12)
The status of Applicant’s delinquent debts is as follows:
SOR ¶  1.a-$4,948  (same  underlying debt  as  SOR ¶  1.f). Applicant incurred this
debt  in  2012.  The  creditor  for  this  original  debt  was  a  bank.  When  Applicant  became
delinquent on the debt he tried to negotiate a payment plan with the bank but it refused
to accept anything other than full payment. In November 2019, Applicant entered into a
payment plan with the successor collector and documented 19 continuous payments of
at least $225 since then. This debt is being resolved. (Tr. 35, 39; GE 8; AE 8; Answer to
SOR).
SOR ¶  1.b-$3,143. Applicant incurred this debt when the family had their furniture
damaged and subsequently purchased new items on credit. No payment arrangements
have been established for this debt. Applicant credibly asserted that once some of  his
other debts are resolved, he will address this debt. (Tr. 39; Answer to SOR)
SOR  ¶   1.c-$836.  Applicant  incurred  this  debt  from  a  line  of  credit  in  2009.  No
payment arrangements have been established for this debt. Applicant credibly asserted
that once some of his other debts are resolved, he will address this debt. (Tr. 42; Answer
to SOR)
SOR ¶  1.d-$14,812. Applicant incurred this debt when a vehicle was repossessed,
sold,  and  he  was  left  with  a  deficiency  balance.  He  negotiated  a  payment  plan  with  a
successor collector in November 2021 and documented making his first $102 payment
under the plan. This debt is being resolved. (Tr. 40-41; AE 14-15)
SOR ¶  1.e-$2,324. Applicant incurred this debt through a home loan secured by a
mortgage. He bought the home when he was stationed at an Air Force base with limited
housing. When it was time to rotate to a new assignment, he could not sell the house
because the base had downsized its military population and the market was flooded with
homes  for  sale.  This  led  to  him  ultimately  defaulting  on  the  loan  and  the  creditor
foreclosed on the property, which was sold  through this process, thereby resolving the
underlying  debt.  No  deficiency  resulted  for  Applicant.  Applicant’s  latest  credit  report
corroborates that no amount is owed. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 31-32, 35, 42-43; GE 8;
AE 8; Answer to SOR)
SOR ¶  1.f-$4,431. This is the same underlying debt as listed in ¶ 1.a above. This
allegation  reflects  the  judgment  on  the  debt  that  the  creditor  obtained.  This  debt  is
resolved. (Tr. 39, 42-44; GE 8; AE 8; Answer to SOR)
Applicant  credibly  testified  that  he  is  currently  in  good  financial  shape.  He
documented that he is current on his car payments, that he adheres to a monthly budget,
and he provided a spreadsheet showing his plan to repay his remaining debts. He also
contracted with a debt management company (DMC), which monitors his credit reports
and disputes any questionable entries. The DMC also offers him advice on strategies to
help his financial wellbeing. His yearly gross income is approximately $106,000 and he
has approximately $1,400 in savings and $25,000 in his retirement account. He has not
incurred  any  new  debt,  and  he  is paying  all  his current bills on  time. (Tr. 45-47, 49-52,  54-
55,  59; AE  13, 15)
Applicant provided character letters from six current coworkers and one from an
Air  Force  colleague.  All  attest  to  his  trustworthiness,  loyalty,  and  work  ethic.  They
recommend his clearance approval. (AE 1.a-1.g)
