discharge. (Tr. 15; AE  E)  He contended  that  his DD  Form  214  incorrectly  indicated  his
rank when  discharged  was senior airman; however, he  was actually a  staff  sergeant (E-

information   technology   security.  (Tr.  23-24;  AE   J)  He  received   a   security   clearance   in

Applicant  first  consumed  alcohol  in  high  school.  (Tr.  42-43)  He  began  drinking
alcohol to intoxication before 2005. (Tr. 43) He rarely drank to intoxication when he was
married from 2004 to 2009. (Tr. 44)
Around  May  2008,  Applicant  was  drinking  beer  while  fishing.  (Tr.  17)  When  he
returned to his Air Force base, security at the gate stopped Applicant and asked him if he
had been drinking. (Tr. 17) He said he was drinking, and he was apprehended for driving
while impaired. (Tr. 17; SOR ¶ 1.d; GE 2 at 13) He believed his blood alcohol  content
(BAC) was below the legal limit, and he was unsure how the authorities concluded he
was intoxicated. (Tr. 54; GE 2 at 11) He received a field grade Article 15 or NJP for drunk
driving and driving with an expired driver’s license. (Tr. 17, 25, 52-55; GE 2 at 6-7) His

(Tr. 25; GE 2 at 13) The record does not contain a copy of the police report or record of
nonjudicial punishment for his 2008 offense. (Tr. 55-56)
Around   September  2011,  Applicant  was  drinking,  and   he   believed   he   was  not
intoxicated.  (Tr. 18) The  police  stopped  his vehicle  for driving  70  miles per hour  (MPH)  in
a  45  MPH zone, and  they  arrested  him  for DUI. (Tr. 18, 27-28; SOR ¶  1.c;  AE  C at 18-
19) His BAC was .08. (Tr. 56-58; AE  C  at 3, 20) He  was convicted  of DUI,  and  a  civilian

successfully  completed  an  alcohol and  substance  abuse  class. (Tr.  18, 28; GE  1  at 30;
AE  C at 5, 9, 13)  His driver’s license  was suspended  “as a  matter of  law”  for an  unspecified
period.  (AE  C  at  5) After the  2011  DUI arrest,  he  modified  his alcohol consumption  by
consuming  less  alcohol. (Tr.  28-29) He  did  not disclose  the  DUI arrest and  conviction  to
his chain  of command  even  though  he  realized  at that time  that he  had  an  obligation  to
disclose it. (Tr. 26-27)
Applicant  disclosed  his  2011  DUI arrest on  his  August 16, 2016  SCA.  (GE 1  at 28-
29)  His  SCA  asked   whether  he   had   been   ordered,  advised,  or  asked   to   seek  alcohol
counseling  or treatment in  the  previous seven  years,  and  he  answered, no.  (Tr. 48-49;
GE  1  at 32) Applicant  said he  answered,  no because  he  believed  the alcohol counseling
or treatment question  was seeking information about one-on-one counseling. (Tr. 49)
Around January and April 2017, Applicant was drinking, and the police stopped his
vehicle on two occasions and arrested him for DUI. (Tr. 18-20; SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d) As
for the April 2017 arrest, he was cited for DUI and driving with a suspended license. (AE
A at 5) The police  alleged  Applicant failed  to yield  to  the  officer’s commands, and  they
pointed  their firearms at  him.  (Tr. 37; GE 2 at  5) Applicant did  not remember resisting
arrest or having firearms pointed at him. (Tr. 37-38) His first BAC from the April 2017 DUI
was .197, and his second BAC was .16. (GE 3 at 3, 5, 14; AE A at 2) Both DUIs were
adjudicated in the same proceeding, and resulted in two DUI convictions. (Tr. 59) The
driving with suspended license was nol prossed. (AE A at 10, 12) He received a combined
sentence,  which  included  12  months  of  probation,  a  $700  fine,  court  costs,  and  a
suspended jail sentence of 60 days. (AE A at 6; AE B at 4) He attended an alcohol and
substance abuse class for 12 hours. (Tr. 19-20, 35) He did not report the two alcohol-
related arrests in 2017 to his employer even though he knew he had a duty to report them.
(Tr. 46-47)
After Applicant completed about eight hours of therapy, his plan was not to drink
more than two drinks at a setting, and not to drink on more than two occasions per month.
(Tr. 21, 40, 51) He has never been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. (Tr. 51) He has
different friends from 2017, and his new friends are not focused on alcohol consumption.
(Tr.  41)  He  enjoys  exercise  and  healthy  outdoor  activities  unrelated  to  alcohol
consumption. (Tr. 41)
Applicant denied having alcohol-related blackouts or having withdrawal symptoms.
(Tr. 45) Over the past 15 years, he abstained from alcohol consumption for nine or ten
month periods and then resumed alcohol consumption. (Tr. 46) He completed alcohol-
related counseling on April 11, 2018. (AE H)
Applicant  signed  a  statement  of  intent  not  to  drive  while  under  the  influence  of
alcohol. (Tr. 22; AE D) He said, “I understand that any future involvement with drinking
and driving is grounds for revocation of my national security eligibility.” (Id.) He promised
to responsibly consume alcohol in the future. (Id.)
On March 9, 2020, a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW), licensed substance
abuse professional (SAP), and certified substance abuse counselor (CSAC), provided an
assessment of Applicant’s alcohol consumption. (AE G) During the  interview, Applicant
said his BAC was “well below the legal limit” when Air Force security personnel arrested
him for DUI in 2008. (Id. at 2) He denied that he was drunk driving for the arrests in 2008
and  2011.  (Id.  at  3)  For  his  January  2017  DUI  arrest,  he  said  the  police  stopped  him
because his brake lights malfunctioned, and the police office did not see him stop for a
stop sign. (Id.) For his April 2017 DUI arrest, the LCSW  said “[u]nlike former situations,
however, in this instance his BAC was above the legal limit.” (Id.) However, she did not
indicate his BAC, which were .197 and .16. She indicated Applicant “has never engaged
in  binge  drinking  or habitual drinking  to  the  point  of  impaired  judgment.” (Id.  at  4) She
noted  that  after  the  two  DUI  arrests  in  2017,  he  successfully  completed  9  months  of
random drug and alcohol urine testing, 12 hours of alcohol and drug abuse classes, and
8 hours of one-on-one counseling with a psychologist. (Id. at 4) The LCSW diagnosed no
alcohol  use  disorder.  (Id.  at  6)  She  recommended  that  he  “engage  in  self  imposed
sobriety,” and that he receive access to classified information. (Id.)

information technology. (AE L)
