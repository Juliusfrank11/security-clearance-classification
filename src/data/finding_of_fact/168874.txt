Applicant  is  a  47-year-old  single  woman  with  a  teenage  child.  She  earned  a
bachelor’s degree in 1997 and has taken some master’s degree-level courses. For the past
three years, she has worked in the defense contracting industry. (Tr. 31) She has been
working with her current employer as a project manager since February 2021. (Tr. 30)
Applicant is highly respected on the job and in her community. According to a former
colleague,  Applicant  “cultivated  a  culture  of  openness  in  information  sharing  which
improved the quality of [their work],” and was “instrumental to the success” of the company.
(AE  G)  According  to  a  professional  mentor,  Applicant  is  a  good  mentee  who  took
everything he said “to heart” and applied his lessons effectively. (Tr. 20-21)
Between  2010  and  2013,  Applicant  defaulted  on  two  credit-card  accounts,
collectively  totaling  approximately  $700  (SOR  subparagraphs  1.a  and  1.b),  and  she
defaulted  on  a  car  loan  (SOR  subparagraph  1.c),  resulting  in  a  repossession  and  an
$11,472 deficiency. (Answer at 2; GE 4 at 4-5; Tr. 46) Also, Applicant failed to file federal
income tax returns timely from 2006 to 2009, and 2012 through 2017, and she failed to file
state  income  tax  returns  timely  for  tax  years  2011,  2014  through  2017.  (SOR
subparagraphs 1.d - 1.f) (Answer at 2) Moreover, between 2011 and 2019, the state taxing
authority placed three liens on Applicant’s property for delinquent income tax debts totaling
$19,000, as alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.g through 1.i. (Answer at 2)
Applicant’s financial problems coincided with her unsuccessful struggle to develop a
catering business that she started in 2005. Her record keeping was poor and income was
erratic. (Tr. 74) She tried to make ends meet through various part-time jobs such as ride-
sharing, house cleaning, substitute teaching, and working in retail. (GE 2 at 11; Tr. 34, 55;
GE 1 at 18; Tr. 74) Applicant’s financial problems were compounded when her son was
born in 2006. Because the child’s father never paid child support, she faced a situation
where  she  was  simultaneously  raising  a  child  with  no  support,  and  trying  to  keep  a
floundering business afloat. (Tr. 33) In early 2012, Applicant sought help from a deacon in
her church to assist with filing her income tax returns. (Tr. 51-53) With the deacon’s help,
she  filed  her  federal  income  tax  returns  for  2006  to  2011.  (Tr.  53;  GE  1  at  26)  The
collective balance was approximately $5,000. (GE 2 at 17-23) Applicant did not make any
payment arrangements at that time. She attributed her failing to pay these taxes to “not
having proper income, barely making it, just trying to survive.” (Tr.58)
Subparagraphs  1.a  and  1.b  are  delinquencies  stemming  from  credit  cards  that
Applicant used to pay living expenses. Subparagraph 1.c is the deficiency from a car she
purchased in 2012. (Tr. 44) After struggling to make car payments, Applicant contacted the
creditor to request a refinance option. (Tr. 45) She could not afford the creditor’s proposal,
whereupon the car was voluntarily repossessed in 2013. (GE 5 at 2) In 2020, the debt was
cancelled and reported to the Internal Revenue Service through a Form 1099-C. (AE N)
In  2017,  Applicant  met  a  high-ranking  federal  government  employee  by
happenstance. (Tr. 20) As they were talking, she mentioned the struggles with her catering
business,  and  sought  his  advice  regarding  a  career  transition.  He  suggested  that  she
become  a  certified  project  manager  and  pursue  a  career  in  the  defense  contracting
industry.  Applicant  took  his  advice,  completed  the  certification  program,  and  began
applying for jobs with various defense contractors and government agencies. (Tr. 36)
Applicant’s  career  change  proved  to  be  successful.  By  January  2021,  she  was
earning $113,000 annually, and she currently earns approximately $135,000. This past
year, she received a $6,000 bonus. (Tr. 37) In contrast, her adjusted gross income in 2017
was $29,000. (GE 2 at 40)
As Applicant’s earnings increased, she began addressing her delinquent finances.
In 2018, Applicant inherited her father’s house after he passed away. After selling it, she
netted approximately $85,000, (Tr. 74; Answer at 12) The receipt of this income facilitated
Applicant’s  ability to pay the  delinquent income taxes, together with bills that were not
alleged  in  the  SOR.  (Tr.  73)  She  satisfied  the  debts  alleged  in  subparagraph  1.a  and
subparagraph 1.b in October 2018 and December 2018, respectively. (GE 2 at 12) In 2018,
Applicant retained an accountant who helped her resolve her income tax delinquencies.
(GE  1)  With  the  accountant’s help,  she filed all of  her remaining, late tax returns, and
satisfied all of the federal income tax delinquencies. (AE D – AE F, AE H) During this time,
Applicant  also  satisfied  the  state  tax  liens.  (AE  K)  The  state  tax  liens  have  been
discharged. In sum, Applicant paid approximate $22,000 to resolve her delinquent state
and federal income taxes.  (AE D, AE K)
In  February  2020, Applicant filed  her federal income  tax  returns  for  2018  and  2019.
(AE  A) She  was  scheduled  to  receive  a  refund  of  $136. (AE  A  at 4)  Applicant maintains a
budget.  (GE N)  She  has approximately  $3,000  in monthly  after-expense  income. (AE  M  at
1)   She   has  $1,900   deposited   in  a   savings  account,  and   has  invested   approximately
$16,000 in an IRA account since  beginning her  current job in February 2021. (Tr. 71)
