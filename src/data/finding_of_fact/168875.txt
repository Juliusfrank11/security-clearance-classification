Financial Considerations

broke into his storage unit. (Tr. 23)
On May 12, 2017, Applicant indicated in his SCA that he filed his federal income
tax return for TY 2015 in 2017. (GE 1 at 33) He did not disclose that he failed to file any
other federal income tax returns. (GE 1) On November 19, 2018, an Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) investigator interviewed him and he discussed his failure to file his
federal income tax returns for TYs 2013 through 2017. (GE 2) He said he was focused
on personal matters and forgot to file his federal income tax returns. (GE 2) He noted his
W-2s were lost. (GE 2) As a result of his OPM interview, he realized  that not filing his

not timely filing his tax returns, and he promised to timely file them in the future. (Tr. 23)

A refund was transferred from Applicant’s TY 2018 tax return to pay his tax debt
for TY 2014. The IRS issued a $4,800 refund for TY 2016, and then assessed additional
taxes  of  $1,100,  which  Applicant  paid  on  September  7,  2021.  (Tr.  30-31;  AE  I)  The
additional  taxes  for  TY  2016  were  due  to  a  creditor  issuing  an  IRS  Form  1099-C,
cancellation of debt. (Tr. 31, 38) He filed his federal income tax returns for TYs 2019 and
2020  in  2021  because  tax  preparation  offices  were  closed  due  to  the  COVID-19
pandemic. (Tr. 27-28) Applicant does not owe any delinquent federal income taxes. (Tr.
48-49; AE A-AE L)
Applicant  had  several  non-SOR  debts.  He  had  a  charged-off  debt  owed  to  a
furniture  store  for  $1,361,  which  has  been  delinquent  since  September  2020.  (Tr.  33)
Applicant believes his spouse is making payments on the account. (Tr. 34) A debt to a
credit union for $2,116 was past due in the amount of $165. (Tr. 35) He recently asked
his spouse to bring the account to current status. (Tr. 35) A credit card debt for $3,172
was past due in the amount of $224. (Tr. 36) At his hearing, Applicant said he would bring
the credit card account current, and he provided a November 30, 2021 receipt showing a
$300 payment. (AE M) He may have a $6,000 delinquent debt, which is not listed on his
2021 credit report; however, he is working to bring the account to current status. (Tr. 37)
Applicant  has  not  had  financial  counseling.  (Tr.  46)  According  to  his  personal
financial statement, his and his spouse’s current gross monthly income is about $7,250.
(AE N) Their net monthly remainder is $259. (AE N)
