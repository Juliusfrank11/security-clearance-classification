Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1; AE 1, 12-19, 34)
Applicant was born in Sri Lanka. He immigrated to the United States in 2003, and
he became a U.S. citizen in 2011. His first wife is also from Sri Lanka. Applicant and his
first wife owned a business from 2005 to 2014. The business ultimately failed. Applicant
had a low-paying job as a collections agent for a bank from about January 2013 until he
quit  in  January 2014. Applicant  had financial  problems  resulting from  the failure  of  his
business, his divorce, and his inability to find a better-paying job. Applicant and his ex-
wife decided that their best option was for Applicant to move back to Sri Lanka in 2014
with their child and live with Applicant’s parents while his ex-wife completed her degree
in the United States. (Tr. at 23-24, 35, 42-43; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1; AE 2,

to Sri Lanka, where he still lives. His current wife is a citizen and resident of Sri Lanka.

The  SOR  alleges  nine  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $28,000.  Applicant
admitted  owing  all  of  the  debts  in  the  SOR,  with  the  exception  of  the  $145  debt  to  a
cable  television  provider  (SOR  ¶  1.h),  which  he  believes  was  paid  by  his  ex-wife.  He
successfully disputed the debt with Experian in 2018. All of the remaining debts became
delinquent  in  2013  or  2014,  except  the  $576  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.g,  which  became
delinquent in 2015. They are all listed on the 2018 credit report. On the December 2021
credit  report,  all  but  the  $576  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.g  were  past  the  seven-year  reporting
period  and  were  no  longer  listed.  The  $576  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.g  was  listed  on  the
December  2021  Experian  and  TransUnion  credit  reports.  The  TransUnion  report
estimated  that  the  debt  will  be  removed  in  February  2022.  It  is  not  listed  on  the
December 2021 Equifax report. (Tr. at 29-31, 49-52; Applicant’s response  to SOR; GE
3-6; AE 9-11, 27, 28, 37, 38)
Applicant  paid  $100  and  $236  debts  that  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  in  April
2019. He has not paid any of the debts alleged in the SOR. The cost of living is low in
Sri  Lanka,  but  the  wages  are  also.  His  wife  has  a  bachelor’s  degree  and  works  at  a
university,  but  only  earns  the  equivalent  of  about  $240  per  month.  Applicant  realized
that education was his path to a better life. He continued with his education in Sri Lanka,
primarily  online  with  U.S.  universities,  and  obtained  student  loans  for  his  tuition  and
living  expenses.  He  plans to  obtain  his bachelor’s  degree,  return  to  the  United States,
get a good job, bring his wife to the United States,  and pay his debts once he has the
means  to  do  so.  If  he  obtains  a  security  clearance,  he  will  be  hired  by  a  defense
contractor  as  a  linguist,  earning  about  $86,000  per  year.  He  has  about  $60,000  in
deferred student loans. He stated that his ex-wife understands that he is unable to pay
child support for their child. (Tr. at 20-21, 25-34, 36-41, 47-48; Applicant’s response  to
SOR; GE 3-6; AE 2-8, 20, 21, 29, 30, 34, 37, 38)
Applicant submitted letters attesting to his excellent job performance and strong
moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his  reliability,  dependability,  work  ethic,  honesty,
responsibility, intelligence, trustworthiness, professionalism, and integrity. (AE 22-24)
