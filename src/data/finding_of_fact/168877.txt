Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations.  He  is  a  35-year-old  field  technician
employed by a U.S. defense contractor since about April 2018. He was is employed by his
clearance sponsor in a similar position from July 2014 to March 2018. He initially was given
a  clearance  during  his  honorable  active-duty  service  in  the  U.S.  military  from  about
December 2008 to about October 2012. He married  in August 2009, and has a  seven-
year-old daughter.
The SOR  alleges,  Items 4-5 establish, and Applicant admits,  14 delinquent debts
totaling nearly $38,000. The bulk of the debt consists of $18,679 for overpayments made
to Applicant on his military accounts (SOR 1.a) and $14,164 for a repossessed automobile
(SOR 1.b). The remaining debts are for unpaid rent, two medical bills, two cable providers,
and a consumer credit account.  He attributes his debts to a period of  underemployment
following his discharge from active duty, but has not otherwise provided details about the
origination of the debts or any efforts to resolve them.
Applicant reported no delinquent debts on his 15 March 2018 clearance application
(Item 3). During a 5 April 2019 interview with a Government investigator (Item 7), Applicant
initially denied having any delinquent  debts, but  was  confronted with  SOR  debts 1.b-1.c
and 1.f-1.h based on his 13 March 2018 credit report (Item 6). He claimed to have been
unaware of the debts, but said he would check his credit report. He later reported to the
investigator that the debts were his, and he would make arrangements to pay the debts
within 60 days. He has documented no actions to resolve these debts. Applicant previously
had  been  confronted  with  delinquent  debts  (later  resolved)  during  a  21  October  2011
interview with a Government investigator (Item 11), involving unpaid parking tickets which
his mother later paid [15 September 2011 credit report (Item 10); 31 December 2008 credit
report (Item 13)]. Applicant was also the subject of a 16 February 2021 incident report under
the DoD Continuous Evaluation Program (Item 14), showing $19,444 in delinquent debt on
a 7 January 2021 credit report, including SOR debts 1.b-1.e and 1.h, and two debts not
alleged in the SOR.
Applicantâ€™s Answer stated  his intent to  variously  arrange  repayment  plans (SOR  1.a-
1.b, 1.h), arrange payment plan and pay within  six months  (SOR 1.c),  resolve  within  90
days (SOR 1.d-1.f), and resolve within 30 days (SOR 1.g). He provided no evidence that
he had undertaken any of the promised actions. He provided no evidence of financial or
credit counseling, or a budget. He provided no work or character references, or evidence
of any community involvement. He provided no evidence of his current financial situation,
including his income, living expenses, and debts.
