In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.m,
1.o, and 1.p. He denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.n. His admissions in his answer and at
the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  59-year-old  help-desk  analyst  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since April 2019. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from January 1989 to
January 1993. He worked for various defense contractors from March 2001 to October
2016.  He  was  unemployed  from  October  2016  to  July  2017,  self-employed  with  low
income from October 2017 to June 2018, and unemployed from June to September 2018.
(GX 1 at 14-23; GX 2 at 9-11.) He has held a security clearance since February 1983. He
earned an associate’s degree in September 1998 and a bachelor’s degree in December
2002.  He  was  married  from  February  1992  to  February  2011.  He  and  his  wife  were
separated for a year before they divorced. (Tr. 29.) He has two adult daughters and an
adult stepson. (Tr. 28.)
The  SOR  alleges  failures  to  timely  file  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns,
delinquent federal tax debts, a delinquent state tax debt, multiple consumer debts, and
two delinquent medical bills. Applicant’s tax problems are established by his admissions
and tax transcripts. The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.h-1.p are reflected in credit reports
from October 2018 (GX 3), October 2019 (GX 4), and July 2021 (GX 5). The evidence
concerning the delinquencies alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶¶  1.a  and 1.b:  failure  to  timely  file  federal  and state  income  tax  returns
for  tax   years   2011-2018. After Applicant and  his ex-wife  separated  in February 2010,
she  claimed  the  tax  exemptions  for  all  three  children.  Because  he  could  claim  no
exemptions, he thought that he owed about $10,000 in federal income tax. (Tr. 31.) Upon
recalculating his taxes with one exemption, he calculated his 2010 federal income tax to
be about $5,300 and his state tax to be zero. (GX 2 at 19, 21; Tr. 34-35.) At the time, his
annual  gross  income  was  between  $70,000  and  $75,000,  and  he  was  paying  child
support of $750 per month and maintaining two households. (Tr. 32-34.) He applied for
an extension of time to file his federal return, which was granted, but he did not file the
return because he could not afford to pay the taxes due for 2010. He did not timely file
his 2011 return because he had not yet filed the 2010 return.
In 2011, Applicant increased his income to about $120,000 by holding two full-time
jobs. The IRS placed a lien on his bank account in 2012. In order to have the lien released,
he  withdrew  funds  from  his  retirement  account  to  pay  the  taxes,  without  realizing  the
adverse tax consequences of early withdrawals. (Tr. 36-37.) He did not file his 2013 and
2014 returns because he had amassed a large tax debt and did not know how to proceed.
(GX 2 at 12.)
In the fall of 2015, Applicant hired a professional tax preparer to help him file his
federal and state income tax returns for 2011 through 2015. (GX 2 at 12.) He submitted
IRS account transcripts showing that his 2011 return was filed in January 2016; and his
2014, 2015, and 2016 returns were filed in February 2016. (GX 2 at 23-31.) In his post-
hearing submission, he submitted IRS account transcripts showing that the 2012 return
was filed in June 2013; his 2019 return was received in June 2020; and his 2020 return
was  filed  in  May  2021.  (AX  G;  AX  K,  AX  L.)  He  submitted  IRS  wage  and  income
transcripts for 2016 and 2017, and 2018, which do not reflect when the returns were filed.
(AX H; AX I.) However, the fact that the IRS agreed to a payment plan indicates that all
past-due returns have been filed. He did not submit any state tax transcripts or other proof
that the past-due state returns had been filed.
SOR  ¶¶  1.c, 1.d,   1.e,  and 1.f:  federal  tax   debts   of  $6,517   for   tax   year  2011;
$21,033  for tax  year 2013;  $2,903  for tax  year 2014;  and $15,850  for tax  year 2015.
In response to CAF interrogatories in January 2020, Applicant admitted the tax debts for
the years alleged in the SOR, and he provided IRS tax transcripts reflecting the amounts
alleged. He made an installment agreement in March 2016, which ended in March 2017.
He made another installment agreement in April 2017, which ended in September 2018
after two payments were dishonored. (GX 2 at 19, 23-31.)
In June 2021, Applicant made an installment agreement for the taxes due for 2013,
2015, and 2017, providing for payments of $200 per month. He admitted at the hearing
that having a payment agreement in place before the hearing was primarily motivated by
the realization that his security clearance was in jeopardy. (Tr. 66.) He made the required
payments  from  July  28,  2021,  through  October  28,  2021.  (AX  G.)  The  payments  will
increase to $752 per month in July 2023. (AX A.) He currently earns about $65,000 per
year. (Tr. 59.) He hopes to submit an offer in compromise before the payments increase
in July 2023. (Tr. 64/)
SOR  ¶   1.g:   state  tax   debt   of  $10,103.  In  July 2021,  Applicant  entered  into  an
installment  agreement  providing  for  monthly  payments  of  $198.86  for  99  months.  The
balance  due  as  of  this  date  was  $15,557.  (AX  B.)  He  made  the  agreed  payments  in
September and October 2021 (AX C; AX D.)
SOR ¶  1.h:  deficiency  of  $27,397  after vehicle  repossession. Applicant testified
that his wife leased a vehicle, and the lease was transferred to him after they separated.
At the end of the lease, he rolled the excess mileage into a lease on an expensive new
vehicle. When he could not afford the payments, he surrendered the vehicle. He made
no payments after the voluntary repossession and has taken no action to resolve the debt.
(Tr. 75-79.)
SOR  ¶   1.i:   credit-card  account   charged   off  for  $6,003.   During  a  security
interview in October 2018, Applicant told a security investigator that he made a payment
agreement in September 2018, providing for payments of $177 per month. He provided
no documentation of this agreement or any payments. At the hearing, he testified that he
had  been  making  $100  payments  since  March  2020.  (Tr.  81.)  In  a  post-hearing
submission, he provided evidence of a payment agreement providing for monthly $210
payments. (AX M.) He provided no documentation showing that he made any payments
under either agreement.
SOR ¶  1.j:  credit-union account  charged off for  $2,456.  This debt is reflected
as charged off for $3,206 in GX 3; past due for $1,556 in GX 4; and charged off for $3,206
in GX 5. In August 2020, he made a payment of $150, leaving a balance of $56.76. (AX
E.) He paid the balance on November 17, 2021. (AX O.)
SOR ¶  1.k:  delinquent  medical bill  for $1,362. At the hearing, Applicant admitted
this debt and testified that he has taken no action to resolve it. (Tr. 86.)
SOR ¶  1.l:  utility  bill  referred for collection  of  $248. Applicant testified that the
owner of a home that he was renting promised to pay this bill but did not keep her promise.
He conceded that he was responsible for the bill, which is unresolved. (Tr. 86-87.)
SOR  ¶   1.m:   debt   referred   for  collection   of   $184.  During  Applicant’s  security
interview in October 2018, he told an investigator that this was an unpaid medical bill.
(GX 2 at 16.) At the hearing, he testified that the bill was for trash collection and that it
had been paid. He did not provide any documentation of payment. (Tr. 87-88.)
SOR 1.n:  delinquent  medical bill for $401. At the hearing, Applicant testified that
this debt had been paid. (Tr. 88.) He did not provide any documentation of payment.
SOR  ¶   1.o:   collection  account   for   $70.   During  the  October  2018  security
interview, Applicant stated that this was a medical bill. (GX 2 at 16.) At the hearing, he
testified that he could not remember this debt. (Tr. 89.) It is not resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.p:   credit  union  account   off  for  $1,556.  Applicant  asserted  and
Department Counsel conceded that this debt is a duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR ¶
1.j. (Tr. 83.)
