Applicant  is  a  52-year-old  senior  systems  administrator  for  a  government
contractor, employed since November 2007. He previously worked for other government
contractors from 2002 to April 2004, when he was laid off. He was unemployed from April
2004 to February 2005, and again worked for government contractors from 2005 to 2007.
Applicant  attended  college,  but  did  not  earn  a  degree.  He  has  two  technical  diplomas
from 1997 and 2019. He was married in 1997 and divorced in 2004. He again married in
2007 and divorced in 2012. He married again in 2013, and has two children (15 and 23)
that do not live with him. Applicant has held a secret security clearance since 2007.
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to timely file his federal
and state income tax returns for tax years 2002-2006, and 2010 to 2016 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and
1.b); that he is indebted to the IRS for tax years 2005, 2008, and 2010 to 2017 totaling
about $101,570 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.l); that he is indebted to state A on liens filed for
tax years 2016 to 2018 (2 allegations) totaling about $82,316; a home foreclosure in 2012;
two medical debts (SOR  ¶¶ 1.q through s); and that he filed Chapter 13  bankruptcy in
2011 with $450,000 in liabilities, that was dismissed in September 13, 2013 for failure to
make payments (SOR ¶ 1.t). The Government withdrew the Guideline E allegations at
the hearing. Applicant admitted SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.a through 1.p, and 1.t, and denied
allegations ¶¶ 1.q and 1.s. The Government’s exhibits support the Guideline F allegations.
The  record  evidence  shows  that  Applicant’s  finances  have  been  a  subject  of
inquiry  by  the  government  for  several  years.  Applicant  responded  to  government
interrogatories  regarding  his  finances  in  2017  and  2019.  He  was  interviewed  by  a
government  investigator  in  2018.  Applicant  and  his  second  spouse  filed  Chapter  13
bankruptcy in June 2011 after purchasing a home. The case was dismissed in September
2013.  As  part of  the filing,  he  attested  to  the  court  in  June  2011, that  he  had filed  his
federal income tax returns for tax years 2007 to 2010. However, the evidence shows that
his TY 2010 return was filed in 2015. He stated that he did not qualify to file Chapter 13
action  on  his  own.  His  property  taxes  ballooned  and  he  could  not  meet  his  financial
obligations. He also owed on tax debts. He claimed he made payments under the Chapter
13 repayment plan, but his spouse did not cooperate and stopped voluntary payments.
As a result, the bankruptcy was dismissed. He entered into a short-sale agreement to sell
his home. There is no deficiency debt owed on the home sale.
Applicant paid  child  support  for  two  children  through  2017.  He  testified  that the  IRS
deemed  him  uncollectable in 2012  or 2013, because  of  his $2,000  per month  child  support
obligations.   When   his  oldest  child   turned   18   years  old,  Applicant’s  tax   advocate
representative  requested  the  IRS  agree  to  an  offer in compromise,  but it was denied. The
IRS   instead   offered   an   installment  agreement.   The   agreement  was  put  in   place   in
December 2019, and Applicant has  been paying  $371  per month  since  then.  His current
agreement  was  renewed   in  November  2020.  He  owes  the   IRS   between   $118,000   -
$120,000. He  filed  federal tax returns as follows:
2004  was filed in Jan 2009
2005  was filed in March 2012
2006  was filed in September 2008
2007 was filed in March 2008
2008 was filed in February 2009
2009 was filed in March 2010
2010 filed in December 2015
2011 filed in July  2012
2012 filed in September 2015
2013 filed in September 2015
2014 filed in November 2015
2015 filed in  May 2018
2016 filed in May 2018
2017 filed in July 2018
2018 filed in August 2019
Applicant also underpaid his 2020 federal taxes by $7,000 because his preparer
did  not  include  critical  information.  He  testified  that  he  did  not  file  tax  returns  on  time
because  of  financial  hardships  and  he  did  not  have  enough  taxes  withheld  from  his
paycheck. Late filing of tax returns, underpayment of 2020 taxes, or other information not
alleged  in  the  SOR  will  not  be  considered  for  disqualifying  purposes,  but  may  be
considered  when  making  a  credibility  determination,  in  the  application  of  mitigating
conditions, and in a whole-person analysis.
Applicant  testified  that  he  lived  in  state  A  between  2004  and  2006,  and  from
November 2011 to August 2016, and believed he filed state tax returns as required, but
had to “refile” them as he could not determine the state received them. In his post-hearing
submission, Applicant provided  a 2019 letter from his state tax accountant, noting that
Applicant  asked  him  to  prepare  state  tax  returns  “for  prior  years.”  Applicant  provided
unsigned and undated state tax returns for tax years 2005-2007, and 2013. He testified
that he filed state tax returns for 2012 to 2015 in December 2020. He believed that his
state tax obligations were covered under his IRS installment agreement, but later learned
it did not. He believes he has now filed all state tax returns, but has not yet satisfied his
state tax liens. He disagrees with the amount the state claimed he owes, but he is unsure
of how much he does owe.
Applicant believes he does not owe the medical debts listed in the SOR, disputed
the accounts and they have been removed from his credit report. The medical debts were
last reflected on his 2019 credit report, but do not appear on his 2021 credit report.  He
attended mandatory credit  counseling in 2011  as required by the bankruptcy court, he
has not received counseling assistance since.
Applicant earns about $108,000 per year, and his spouse earns about $89,000 per
year. Despite this sizable household income, they live “paycheck to paycheck.” He has
about $936 in savings and $259 in checking accounts. He continues to pay about $800
per month in child support and owes for the next two years. He bought a home in 2016
with  a  down  payment from  a  $20,000  loan  against  his 401k  retirement  plan.  He  owed
about $40,000 in credit card accounts. He and his spouse owe about $106,000 in student
loans  (Applicant  has  about  $6,000  of  the  debt).  Applicant  recently  made  home
improvements and owes at least $10,000. Applicant took vacations in 2014 to 2019 to
Bahamas, Mexico (4 times), Dominican Republic, Jamaica, West Indies, and Dubai, but
claims his brother paid for most of the trips as gifts.
