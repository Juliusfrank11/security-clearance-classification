Applicant admitted the child support debt at SOR 1.b; although he asserted that
the debt was now about $3,000. He denied the remaining allegations, claiming that some
of the debts were duplicates, some had been paid, and some had been paid down.
Applicant is a 41-year-old air battle management subject matter expert employed
by a U.S. defense contractor since July 2018. He served honorably in the U.S. military
from about March 1998 to about March 2018, when he retired. He held a clearance early
in his military career, but was denied a clearance in August 2009 for financial issues. He
has not previously held an industrial clearance (Item 3).
From  September  1998  to  July  2016,  Applicant  fathered  six  children  with  four
different women in four different states. He does not have eight children as stated in the
FORM. Nor did he omit two children from his clearance application (Item 3) as stated in
his May 2019 interview with a Government investigator (Item 7). The two children listed
as missing from the clearance application in Item 7 are clearly listed in Item 3. The given
names, dates of birth, and states of birth match exactly.
Applicant was born in early September 1979. He graduated from a hometown high
school in May 1997. He enlisted in the U.S. military in about March 1998. His first child,
a  son,  was  born  01  September  1998,  in  Applicant’s  hometown.  The  record  is  unclear
whether Applicant was aware of this pregnancy and birth at the time, or at what point the
mother began pursuing child support, but at the time of Applicant’s 12 September 2018
credit  report  (Item  6)—two  years  after  his  son  turned  18  years  old—his  child  support
arrears to this state was the nearly $13,000 alleged at SOR 1.e. This allegation appears
to be a duplicate of SOR debt 1.d, based on the delinquent amount reported in Applicant’s
30 July 2019 credit report (Item 5). Applicant denied SOR debt 1.e based on the fact that
his 27 January 2020 credit report (Answer) showed that his 27 December 2019 balance
had been reduced to $3,489. Applicant’s 13 December 2020 credit report (Item 4) showed
the account as “paid collection” in November 2020. Applicant’s Response to the FORM
shows a last payment to the state on 8 December 2020, a termination of a withholding
order for support from Applicant’s military retirement of uncertain date, and a 25 January
2021 credit reporting a zero balance on this account as of 27 November 2020.
Applicant’s second child, a daughter, was born 2 February 2000, in the state that
appears to have been Applicant’s first non-training, active duty station. Again, the record
is unclear whether Applicant was aware of this pregnancy and birth at the time, or at what
point  the  mother  began  pursuing  child  support,  but  at  the  time  of  Applicant’s  12
September 1998 credit report (Item 6)—seven months after his daughter turned 18 years
old—his child support arrears to this state was slightly more than the $5,436 alleged at
SOR 1.b. The alleged amount is the amount from Applicant’s 30 July 2019 credit report
(Item  5).  However,  Applicant’s  13  December  2020  credit  report  (Item  4),  shows  a
collection amount of $4, based on a last payment date of September 2020. However, at
the time the creditor was not able to locate the Applicant. Applicant noted that this account
did not appear on his 27 January 2020 credit report (Answer), but that is because the
creditor did not report this account to the credit bureau Applicant used at the time. He
later  admitted  owing  $3,000.  However,  his  25  January  2021  credit  report  (Response)
shows  the  account  (opened  in  March  2000)  closed  as  of  31  December  2020  with  the
same $4 delinquent balance listed in Item 4. The record is unclear whether Applicant was
paying voluntarily or having his wages garnished.
Applicant had three children with his wife, whom he married 6 March 2000. She
was pregnant when they married, and Applicant’s third child, a second daughter was born
on  18  April  2000,  in  the  same  state  as  his out-of-wedlock  daughter.  Applicant’s  fourth
child, a second son, was born 22 July 2002, and his fifth child, a third daughter, was born
3 May 2006, both near Applicant’s next duty station in another state.
Two duty stations later, Applicant and  his wife divorced on 23 May 2011, and it
appears his ex-wife and the three children moved to her hometown. That may explain the
delinquent child support in the state where they divorced (SOR 1.c) and the state where
she  moved  (SOR  1.f).  SOR  debt  1.c  alleges  $5,254  child  support,  of  which  $4,718  is
delinquent as of July 2019 (Item 5). SOR debt 1.f alleges $11,971 child support, all of it
delinquent as of October 2015 (Item 6). However, Applicant’s 30 December 2020 credit
report (Item 4) shows that the account was “paid as agreed” before being transferred/sold
in  October  2015.  Nevertheless,  it  seems  Applicant’s  ex-wife  may  have  moved  again,
leading to the child support debts at SOR 1.a and 1.g.
SOR debts 1.a  and  1.g  are with  the  same  state, and  there seems to  have  been  a
third   account with   that    state,    documented   by   Applicant’s 27   January   2020   credit report
(Answer), which shows an  account  seriously past  due  for $502.  However, this account
does  not appear  on  any  of the  credit  reports obtained  by  the  Government.  SOR  debt  1.a
appears  on   all   three   Government-obtained   credit  reports   (Items  4-6),  alleged   in   the
amount appearing   on  both  the  13   December   2020   (Item   4) and   30   July   2019   (Item   5)
credit reports, and   with   an   account   number distinct from   both   Applicant’s 27   January   2020
credit report and   the   account number for SOR debt 1.f,   which appears on   Applicant’s 12
September 2018 credit report (Item 6) in the  SOR-alleged past due  amount.
Finally, in July  2016, Applicant  had  his sixth  child, another daughter,  with  another
woman,  in  the  state  where he  was last  stationed.  Beyond  listing  his  wife  and  children  as
required   on   his  clearance   application,   Applicant  has   explained   very   little  about   the
circumstances attending  the  births of  his children. His 2  May  2019  subject  interview  (Item
7) suggests  that paternity   tests  established  his parenthood   in   any   case   where  it might
have  been  at issue, but he  has not explained  the  timing  of  any  of  these  events other than
the  actual births.
The  SOR  alleges,  and  Items  3-7  document,  11  delinquent  debts  totaling  nearly
$59,000. Applicant admits one debt, asserting that it is significantly lower than the amount
alleged  in  the  SOR.  The  debts  consist  of  over  $56,000  in  delinquent  child  support
payments to five states, and four delinquent commercial accounts totaling almost $2500,
that Applicant claims to have paid.
Applicant  disclosed  SOR  debts  1.e,  1.g,  1.h,  1.i,  and  1.k  on  his 3  August  2018
clearance application (Item 3). He discussed and confirmed these debts during his 2 May
2019 interview with a Government investigator (Item 7), but also agreed to the other SOR
debts  reported  on  Applicant’s  12  September  2018  credit  report  (Item  6),  including  the
child support debts at SOR 1.a, 1.b, and 1.f. At the time, he said he did not recognize
SOR debt 1.j because he thought he only had one account with that creditor. He claimed
to have paid SOR debts 1.h-1.k, but provided no documentation. However, Applicant’s
13 December 2020 credit report (Item 6) shows SOR debt 1.i paid in May 2019.
Aside  from  more  recent  credit  reports  from  the  credit  bureau  which  originally
reported  the  fewest  of  the  SOR  debts,  an  undated  termination  of  income  withholding
support order from the state listed in SOR debts 1.d-1.e from his military retirement, and
an  8  December  2020  payment  receipt  from  the  same  state.  Applicant  documented  no
efforts  to  contact  any  of  his  creditors  or  to  provide  a  current  status  of  his  debts.  He
documented no credit or financial counseling, and did not submit a budget. He provided
no work or character references, or evidence of community involvement. It appears that
except for his two youngest daughters, born in 2006 and 2016, respectively, his ongoing
child support obligations have expired, except for any arrears still due.
