In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c
and denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.f. His admissions in his answer and at the
hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 45-year-old information systems developer employed by a federal
contractor since May 2018. He married in November 2004, divorced in June 2008, and
married his current spouse in July 2010. He obtained a  bachelor’s degree in computer
science in 2002 and a master’s degree and a doctorate in theology in May 2018. He has
never held a security clearance.
Applicant has five children, ages 22, 21, 19, 14, and 8. The oldest is active-duty
military. The second oldest just graduated from college and lives at home while looking
for a job. The 19-year-old is in college but is financially self-sufficient.
Applicant  testified  that  he  and  his  wife  were  both  employed  in  public  school
systems in 2012. He earned about $80,000 per year and his wife earned $50-60 thousand
per year, but they did not know how to budget their money. In 2014, they both took pay
cuts to work in a charter school. Due to personality conflicts with the director of the charter
school, Applicant’s wife was fired in December 2015, and he was fired in February 2016.
(Tr. 23.) As a result, their car was repossessed and they were evicted from their home.
(Tr. 19-20.)
Applicant was self-employed from February 2016 to May 2017, when he was hired
by  a  non-federal  employer  as  a  system  developer.  He  was  fired  in  November  2017,
because his meticulous manner of working was not consistent with the fast-paced work
ethic of his employer. (Tr. 24.) After being fired, he was self-employed until he was hired
by his current employer in May 2018.
In response to DOD CAF interrogatories, Applicant submitted a personal financial
statement in September 2019 reflecting his net monthly salary of $5,804; his spouse’s net
monthly salary of $4,010; monthly expenses of $5,910; debt payments of $2,590; and a
net monthly remainder of $3,910. (GX 2 at 8.) Applicant recently received a raise to about
$110,000 per year. (Tr. 32-33.)
The evidence concerning the allegations in the SOR debts is summarized below.
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b,  failure  to  file  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  as
required for tax years 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. Applicant attributed his failure to
timely file his federal and state tax returns to procrastination. (AX F.) In response to CAF
interrogatories in September 2019, he stated that he had filed all his past-due returns but
that his tax preparer had destroyed his copies of them. He stated that he had filed the
returns again but had not received the tax transcripts reflecting that they had been filed.
(GX  2  at  7.)  He  attached  receipts  reflecting  that  large  envelopes  had  been  mailed  on
September 13, 2019 (the same day that he responded to DOD CAF interrogatories about
his delinquent debts and past-due tax returns), to cities where the federal and state tax
authorities are located. (GX 2 at 17.)
In  Applicant’s  post-hearing  submission,  he  submitted  an  unsigned  copy  of  his
federal return for 2012, but he submitted no proof that it was mailed or received. (AX I.)
He submitted a copy of his state return for 2012. (AX H.) He submitted no proof of mailing
or receipt for the state return, but he submitted a document reflecting that his claim for a
refund was denied because he did not file his return within three years from the due date.
(AX G.) The denial of a claim for a refund indicates that the state return for 2012 was filed.
He  provided  no  documentary  evidence  that  the  other past-due  state  returns had been
filed.
In September 2020, Applicant submitted a request for an installment agreement
for his state tax debt of $26,884, requesting that it be paid in monthly installments of $460.
(AX J.) He submitted no proof that the request was mailed, received, or accepted. At the
hearing, he testified that $442 has been deducted from his bank account every month
since  October  2020.  (Tr.  63.)  He  did  not  submit  any  documentation  to  support  his
testimony.
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  owed  about  $4,000  in  federal  income
taxes and that he intended to request a payment agreement. (Tr. 57-58) He submitted no
evidence of a payment agreement as of the date the record closed.
Applicant’s federal and state tax debts were not alleged in the SOR. Accordingly,
I  have  considered  them  only  for  the  limited  purpose  of  evaluating  his  evidence  of
mitigation and as part of my whole-person analysis.
SOR ¶ 1.c, car loan charged off for $8,948. The debt is the deficiency after a car
was repossessed. (GX 3 at 6.) In September 2021, Applicant offered to settle this debt
for a lump-sum payment of $3,183. When this offer was rejected, he offered to pay $150
per month, and this offer was accepted. (AX A.) He submitted no evidence that he had
made any of the agreed payments as of the date the record closed.
SOR ¶ 1.d, public housing debt referred for collection of $646. Applicant paid
this debt in December 2020. (AX K.)
SOR  ¶  1.e,  telecommunications  debt  referred  for  collection  of  $269.  At  the
hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  this  debt  was  incurred  when  his  ex-wife  opened  a
cellphone account in his name and did not pay the bill. He testified that he contacted the
cellphone servicer and reported that the account was fraudulently opened by his ex-wife,
but  they  did  nothing  in  response  to  his  report.  (Tr.  33-34.)  In  Applicant’s  post-hearing
submission,  he  gave  a  different  explanation,  stating  that  this  debt  was  for  unreturned
telecommunications  equipment,  that  he  had  returned  the  equipment,  and  a  tracking
record for return of the equipment was attached to his cover letter. However, no tracking
record was attached. (AX F.) The debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.f, medical bill referred for collection of $162. Applicant disputed this
debt because he believed it was covered by his insurance. He submitted documentation
that he had medical insurance, but his documentation does not reflect whether the small
debt alleged in the SOR was a copayment or some other expense not covered by the
terms of his insurance policy. He told a security investigator that his insurance company
informed him that the original creditor had not submitted a claim for this bill. (GX 2 at 3.)
At  the  hearing,  he  testified  that  he  had  Medicaid  until  shortly  before  he  had  a  routine
medical checkup. He told the doctor’s office that he was no longer on Medicaid but was
covered  by  his  wife’s  insurance.  However,  the  doctor’s  office  submitted  the  bill  to
Medicaid, which refused to cover it. According to Applicant, the doctor’s office refused to
resubmit the bill. Applicant testified that he offered to pay part of the bill, but the doctor’s
office  insisted  on  full  payment.  (Tr.  41-42.)  He  did  not  submit  any  documentation  to
support his dispute.
Applicant  submitted  evidence  that  a  credit-card  bill  for  $2,694,  which  was  not
alleged  in  the  SOR,  had  been  paid  in  full.  (AX  E)  At  the  hearing,  he  testified  that  he
submitted this document to demonstrate due diligence in resolving his financial problems.
