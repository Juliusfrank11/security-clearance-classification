Applicant  has
financial  problems,  which  he  attributed  to  unemployment,
underemployment, and his girlfriend being out of work because of the COVID pandemic.
Applicant’s work history  includes several terminations,  which  he described as primarily
for  events  that  were  not  his  fault.  The  father  of  his  girlfriend’s  child  is  significantly  in
arrears  on  his  child  support  obligations.  Applicant  also  stated  that  he  worked  for  his
uncle remodeling a house. His uncle accepted $5,000 for the job and did not complete
the work. The owner threatened  legal action.  Applicant paid  some of  the money back,
even  though  it  was  not  his  debt.  (Tr.  at  12-13,  16,  19-25,  32;  Applicant’s  response  to

SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a $24,141 charged-off auto loan. Applicant admitted owing the
debt, but not the amount. In his response to the SOR, he stated that the correct amount
was $16,167. The two most recent credit reports list the balance of the debt as $16,167.
Applicant  testified  that  he  spoke  with  the  creditor  who  told  him  the  balance  was
$13,159.  He  asserted  that  he  contacted  the  creditor  about  settling  the  debt,  but  their
settlement  offer  was  well  beyond  his  ability  to  pay.  (Tr.  at  11-12,  15,  26;  Applicant’s

The  collection  company  for  the  $1,270  charged-off  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b
sued  Applicant.  On  August  31,  2021,  the  collection  company  offered  a  stipulated
judgment.  Applicant  accepted  the  offer;  and  agreed  that  he  owed  $1,270  in  principal,
plus court costs of $263, minus payments of $75, for a total of $1,458. Applicant agreed
to  pay  $75  by  September  17,  2021,  followed  by  monthly  payments  of  $75.  Applicant
asserted,  without  additional  documentation,  that  he  made  three  payments  under  the
agreement. (Tr. at 13-15, 29; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE A-C)
Applicant  denied  owing  the  $332  charged-off  department  store  credit  card  debt
(SOR  ¶ 1.c). Applicant stated that he  closed the account and  paid the  credit  card, but
about a year later the creditor contacted him about a balance on the account. The debt
is listed on the 2019 credit report as opened in January 2013, with a date of last action
of August 2013, and the comment: “Consumer disputes after resolution.” The debt is not
listed on the December 2020 and August 2021 credit reports, but both credit reports are
beyond  the  seven-year  reporting  window.  (Tr.  at  29-30;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR;
GE 2-4)
SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  a  $182  delinquent  debt  to  an  insurance  company.  Applicant
denied  owing  the  debt.  He  stated  his  auto  insurance  was  cancelled  when  his  vehicle
was  repossessed.  The  debt  is  listed  on  the  three  credit  reports  in  evidence. When  he
contacted  the  insurance  company,  he  was  told  that  the  company  would  not  settle  the
debt  because  it  was  under  $200,  but  Applicant  could  make  payments  on  the  debt.
Applicant  testified  that  he  could  not  afford  a  lump-sum  payment  of  the  debt,  but  he
would pay about $20 to $40 per month toward the debt until it is paid. He did not submit
any evidence of payments in his post-hearing submission. (Tr. at 15, 30-31; Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2-4)
Applicant  asserted  that  his finances  are  in  better shape,  and  he  lives  within  his
means. He monitors his credit. His girlfriend has a stable job. He stated that he intends
to pay his debts. (Tr. at 16-17, 26-28, 31-32, 35-36)
