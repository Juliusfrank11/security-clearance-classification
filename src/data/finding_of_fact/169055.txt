Applicant is a  32-year-old risk analysis and  monitoring  technician  for a  government
contractor   working   for  another  government   agency,  employed   since   July   2021.   He
previously  worked for another contractor from October 2018  to March 2021, but was laid
off. Applicant  earned  a bachelor’s degree in  2012. He  is not  married  and has one seven-
year-old child. Applicant holds  an interim security eligibility.
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant owes approximately $29,000 in
six delinquent debts. His debts include a past-due car loan (SOR ¶ 1.a), a charged-off car
loan  (SOR  ¶  1.b),  10  past-due  Department of  Education  loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c-1.m),  and
three  charged-off  credit  accounts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.n-1.p).  The  remaining  Guideline  F
allegations include failure to file Federal income tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018
when due (SOR ¶ 1.q); failure to file state income tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018
when due (SOR ¶ 1.r); and a $4,290 debt to the Federal government for delinquent taxes
owed from tax year 2017. Finally, the SOR alleges Applicant failed to report his tax filing
and payment delinquencies in his January 2019 SCA (SOR ¶ 2.a). Applicant admitted all
of  the  SOR  allegations  with  explanations.  The  government’s  exhibits  support the  SOR
allegations.
Applicant replied to government interrogatories in June and July 2021, and had not
resolved his tax debts or filed in 2017 or 2018 tax returns by that time. Applicant testified
at  the  hearing  that  he  owed  the  IRS  about $4,290 for tax  year  2016.  He  did  not  have
enough withheld from his pay, did not receive his W-2 forms, and had a mix up with his
former girlfriend over his ability to claim his daughter as a deduction. Applicant filed his
2017 and 2018 tax returns in August 2020, and paid his debt through attachment of his
federal refunds for those years. Of note, Applicant provided a post-hearing exhibit from
the IRS showing a portion of his 2017 refund was applied to a 2015 debt, not 2016. He
also  owed  a  state  for  taxes  from  2016,  and  believes  he  satisfied  the  debt  through
attachment of his 2017 tax refund. After the hearing, Applicant attempted to contact the
state tax authority, but was unable to obtain a balance letter in time for his post-hearing
reply. Applicant did not report any tax delinquencies or his failure to file his 2017 Federal
and state tax returns when due, in his January 2019 SCA. His 2018 tax returns were not
yet due when he completed his SCA.
Applicant  has  student-loan  accounts  that  became  past  due  totaling  $6,858,  in
about 2017. He testified that he contacted the loan servicing agency, and was requested
to submit an income status document and report his income to the agency. He failed to
submit  the  document  or  report  his  financial  status  changes  since  2017.  As  a  result  of
COVID-19  related  Executive  Order  in  2020,  his  student  loans  became  deferred.  They
remain in a deferred status with no past-due amounts owed.
Applicant  has  two  past-due  car  loans.  He  purchased  a  2007  BMW  in  2014  for
$16,000. He failed to make payments on the loan in 2017, and the car was repossessed
in 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.b). He was offered a settlement amount of $5,000, but he does not have
the  funds  to  pay  the  debt  or  the  settlement.  Applicant  bought  another  car  in  2019  for
$22,000 (SOR ¶ 1.a). He made payments on the loan in the first few months, then made
occasional payments thereafter. He testified that his work hours were cut in 2020 due to
COVID-19, but did not provide evidence of a pay loss. He said he made a $1,200 payment
in September 2021. He is past due about $10,000 or $11,000.
Applicant has a credit card debt for about $1,062, listed in SOR ¶ 1.o. The debt
was incurred while he was in college, and he did not pay anything beginning in 2015 or
2016. In about June 2021, he started paying $15.85 per month in a payment plan with
the  creditor.  He  provided  post-hearing  documentation  showing  he  paid  6  of  67
installments as of October 2021.
Applicant  has  two  other  consumer  debts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.n  and  1.p),  totaling  about
$1,621. He disputed the phone company debt (SOR ¶ 1.p) in 2016, but it remains a past-
due debt on his 2020 credit report and Applicant was sent a collection letter. The $1,379
debt in SOR ¶ 1.n was opened in 2018 and charged off in 2019. The debt is reflected on
Applicant’s  2020  credit  report.  Applicant  testified  that  he  paid  the  balance  of  $400  in
February 2021. Nether debt appears on his 2021 credit report.
Applicant earns about $101,000 per year, rents a home, and shares custody of his
daughter,  but  his  daughter  lives  with  her  mother.  He  has  no  bank  savings  and  no
retirement  account  savings.  He  has  about  $200  in  his  checking  account.  He  has  not
sought financial counseling.  He  traveled for pleasure to  Jamaica  in  2015 and 2018, to
Dominican  Republic  in  2019,  to  Jamaica  in  2020,  and  Dominican  Republic  and  Dubai
UAE in 2021.
