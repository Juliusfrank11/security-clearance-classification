Applicant  denied  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  in  his  Answer.  He  is  47  years  old,
unmarried,  and  has  two  minor  children.  As  of  his  April  2019  security  clearance
application (SCA), he owned a home since 2010. (Items 2, 3, 6)
Applicant graduated from high school in 1993. He earned an associate degree in
2002 and a bachelor’s degree in 2005. He served in the U.S. military from 1996 to 1999
and  2005  to  2009,  and  was  honorably  discharged  on  both  occasions.  He  was
unemployed  from  July  2009  to  February  2010.  He  then  worked  for  a  previous  DOD
contractor from  March 2010 to September 2015, when he  was  laid  off  after a  contract
concluded.  He  was  unemployed  until  March  2016.  He  began  working  as  a  systems
engineer for his employer, another DOD contractor, as of the date of his 2019 SCA. He
was first granted a security clearance in 2005. (Items 3, 6)
The   SOR  alleged   that   Applicant  failed   to   file   his  federal  and   state   income   tax
returns for tax  year 2014, as required  (SOR ¶¶  1.a  - 1.b).  It  also alleged  that he  has  ten
delinquent  consumer debts totaling  $73,386  (SOR ¶¶  1.c  - 1.l).  In  his Answer, Applicant
denied   all   of   the   SOR   debts.   He   claimed,  without  providing   any   corroborating
documents,   that  the   debt  in  SOR  ¶   1.j  is  an   error  and   has  never  existed;  the   debt  in
SOR  ¶   1.k  is  a   duplicate   of   SOR  ¶   1.h;  and   the   debt   in  SOR  ¶   1.l  was  a   billing   error
incorrectly   sent  to   a   collection   agency   and   has  been   resolved.   He  disclosed   and
discussed   his  failure  to   file   his  2014   federal  and   state   income   tax   returns   and   his
delinquent   indebtedness  to   multiple   creditors  in  the   amount   of  approximately   $60,000
on his 2019  SCA  and during  his 2019  background  interview.  The  debts in  SOR ¶¶  1.c  to
1.j are  listed  on  his 2019  and  2020  credit bureau  reports, and  the  debt  in SOR ¶  1.l is
listed   on   his  2019   credit  bureau   report.  Both   credit  reports  establish  that  the   debt  in
SOR ¶  1.k is a  duplicate of  the debt in SOR ¶  1.h. (Items 1-6)
Applicant  attributed  his  failure  to  file  his  2014  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns  and  his  delinquent  debts  to  a  six-month  period  of  unemployment  beginning  in
September 2015, the unplanned birth of his child in 2016, “another child on the way” as
of his background interview, and associated child-care expenses. Although he received
state unemployment benefits during this period of unemployment, it was “just enough to
pay for basic necessities.” (Items 2, 3, 6)
Applicant  stated  during  his  background  interview  that  the  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.c,
1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.l are credit cards, and the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.j are
loans.  He  stated  that  he  paid  SOR  ¶  1.l,  was  paying  SOR  ¶  1.j  at  $56  monthly,  and
made  some  payments  towards  the  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.e.  He  failed  to  provide
corroborating documentation. He further stated during his background interview that his
current financial status “sucks,” and he was unable to repay his debts because he had
another  child  on  the  way  and  would  then  have  two  children  requiring  daycare.  He
considered filing bankruptcy. He had not received any financial counseling or engaged
any debt consolidation services. (Item 6)
