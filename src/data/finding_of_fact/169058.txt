Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR except ¶ 1.e, which he denied.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 52  years old. He  earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in  1999  and  a  master’s
degree   in  2006.  He   served   in   the   military  from   1992   to   1996   and   was  honorably
discharged. He married in 1992 and divorced in 2017. He remarried  his wife in 2018 and
divorced   in   2019.  He   has   two   children,   daughters  ages  22   and   20   years  old.  He   has
worked  for the  same  employer since  1999  with  a  short period  of  employment with  another
contractor during  this period. Since  he  was discharged  from  the  military, he  has had  no
periods of  unemployment. Applicant’s  annual  salary  as of  March  2021  is $175,000. His
income  has increased  incrementally  from  about $150,000  in  2018  to  his present salary.
Applicant testified  that he  has held  a  security  clearance  since  1992.  (Transcript  (Tr.)  21-
26,  56)
Applicant  attributed his  past  financial  issues  to his  wife’s  gambling  problem.  He
became  aware  of  it  around  2007.  She  would  gamble  away  her  paycheck  and  then
withdraw  money  from  their  joint  account  and  gamble  that  money  away.  Her  problem
gradually became worse. She would seek help,  attend counseling,  but then eventually
resume gambling again. Applicant supported her when she sought professional help for
her gambling problem. He said that once her problem got out of control he took over the
finances, but could not recall exactly when that occurred. He wanted to save his marriage.
Each time she would be remorseful, and Applicant would accept her commitment to stop
gambling, but she repeatedly resumed gambling. (Tr. 35, 38, 43-46)
After  Applicant  and   his  wife   divorced   in   2017,  they   reconciled   and   remarried   in
November  2018.  They  were   living   in   different  states  at  the   time.  His  wife   was  getting
professional  help.  They   did   not  share   a   bank   account.   He   learned   she   was  gambling
again,  and  they  divorced. Applicant stated  that his wife’s gambling  impacted  his finances.
His younger daughter  was living  with  his wife  and  the  older daughter  moved  out with  him.
Applicant  provided   financial  support  for  his  younger  child.  His  wife   has  worked   for  the
same  federal contractor as Applicant for 20  years and  has a  security  clearance. (Tr. 46-
49)
Applicant provides his  daughters financial support. Both are in college. He pays
their tuition, room, board, and other expenses. His younger daughter gets some financial
aid and attends  a private college at  a campus in a foreign country.  Applicant  pays the
amount  not  covered.  His older  daughter  now also receives  financial aid for her tuition,
and Applicant pays her room, board, and incidental expenses. He was paying more for
her expenses before she began receiving financial aid. He estimated that he now pays
approximately $5,300 a month for both daughters’ expenses. Applicant is committed to
ensuring his children are cared for and their school expenses are paid. (Tr. 50-54; AE F)
Applicant has no other income source except what he earns from his employer.
He  estimated  he  has  about  $250-$300  in  his  checking  account  and  $40  or  $50  in  his
savings account. He has about $13,000 to $14,000 in a 401k pension plan. He estimated
that after he pays his daughters’ expenses and his living expenses he has about $1,000
to $1,500 remaining in expendable income. He uses that for routine items or providing
additional money for his daughters. (Tr. 43, 57-61)
Applicant purchased a 2017 BMW for $43,000 in May 2020. He withdrew $13,000
from his 401k pension plan for the down payment. He deferred payment of the taxes and
penalty on the withdrawal for when he filed his 2020 annual tax return. (Tr. 26-27, 61-64)
The SOR alleges two delinquent medical debts in ¶¶ 1.a ($383) and 1.b (643) that
were  incurred  in  2015.  In  January  2019,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government
investigator and was confronted with the debts. In June 2021, after receiving the SOR,
Applicant began making payments. He has made seven payments and resolved the debt
in SOR ¶ 1.a. He still owes the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b and said he is making payments on it.
This debt is being resolved. He testified that he was aware of the debts and has no excuse
for not paying them as required. (Tr. 37-38, 65-68; AE C, D)
Applicant incurred a third medical debt in 2018 that is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c ($141).
He did not pay the debt until after he received the SOR. He stated he has no excuse for
his failure to timely pay this debt. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 67-68; Answer to SOR)
Applicant purchased a new vehicle in 2015 for $44,000 (SOR ¶ 1.d). His payments
became delinquent in 2018 and the vehicle was repossessed. He was able to retrieve the
vehicle after he paid the deficiency. It was repossessed again in 2020, when he did not
make  the  payments.  He  stated  the  monthly  payments  were  approximately  $1,078.  In
Applicant’s  SOR  answer  he  said  he  would  contact  the  creditor  and  begin  making
payments  in  June  2021.  He  did  not.  In  December  2021,  he  contacted  the  creditor  to
resolve the debt, but it wanted larger payments than he can afford. He made one payment
of  $100.  Applicant  does  not  have  an  accepted  payment  plan  with  the  creditor.  When
asked why he delayed in contacting the creditor, he said he just did not do it, but intends
to do so now. (Tr.68-74; GE 2; AE B).
Applicant  and  his  wife  purchased  a  home  in  2006  for  approximately  $400,000.
They  became  delinquent  on  their  mortgage  payments  and  the  last  payment  was  in
December 2016. Applicant and his eldest child moved from the house in February 2017
when  Applicant  separated  from  his  wife.  He  testified  that  at  some  point,  the  creditor
accepted a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Applicant testified that they had a “cash for keys”
agreement  with  the  mortgage  company.  Applicant’s  documents  do  not  reflect  this
agreement.  Applicant  believes  he  is  not  responsible  for  the  deficiency  owed  for  the
mortgage. Credit reports from August 2017, August 2019, January 2021, and December
2021, all reflect a past-due amount of $16,997. In May 2017, Applicant received an IRS
Form 1099-C cancellation of debt from the mortgage company in the amount of $133,503.
When questioned, Applicant stated he did not file this form with his 2017 federal income
return.  Post-hearing,  Applicant  provided  an  email  from  the  creditor  with  a  portion  of  a
document  reflecting  his  mortgage.  Although  it  shows  the  principal  as  zero,  part  of  the
page is missing so it is inconclusive to determine if a deficiency balance is owed. Applicant
did not provide substantive evidence to conclude he does not owe a deficiency on the
mortgage. However, the deficiency is likely included in the cancellation of debt issued by
the mortgage company. The debt is resolved. (Tr. 35-37; 74-81; Answer to SOR; GE 2,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8; AE E, G)
Applicant  testified   that  he   and   his  wife   would   prepare   their   tax   returns   together.
She   would   make   payment  plans   when   they  were   married.  There   were   periods  of   time
where  there was a disconnect between  Applicant and  his wife  on who was managing  the
taxes.  Applicant  filed   his  2014   federal  tax   return   in   September  2015   (balance   owed  -
$4,142);  2015  tax  return  filed  June  2017  (balance  owed  - $2,339); 2016  filed  April 2017
(balance  owed  - $6,704); 2017  –  extension  request granted, filed  past extension  in  May
2019   (balance   owed   -  $828);  2018   filed   month   late   May   2019   (no   balance   owed).
Applicant  filed   his  2019   federal  income   tax  return   in   October  2020   (balance   owed   -
$1,850). Applicant testified  that he  probably  filed  his 2020  federal income  tax  return  late.
He noted that he believes he owes a total of  about $30,000 in past-due taxes to the IRS.
(Tr.  33-35, 81-99; GE 2, 3)
Applicant  testified  that  due  to  his  wife’s  gambling  problem,  he  would  take
withdrawals from his 401k pension plan to pay bills and would incur additional tax liabilities
in certain years. This began in approximately 2011. He would defer paying the taxes on
the  withdrawals until the  end  of  the  year.  He  was  then  unable to  pay the  tax liabilities
during those years. Applicant testified that he would make periodic payments to the IRS
for  his  delinquent  taxes,  but  did  not  have  an  approved  installment  agreement  with  the
IRS. Applicant’s 2014 tax transcript reflects an installment agreement was established in
January  2016.  Two  payments  of  $1,184  and  $777  were  made  in  June  2019.  Another
installment agreement was established in September 2019. A payment of $183 was made
in  May  2020.  Post-hearing,  Applicant  provided  a  document  from  the  IRS  reflecting  a
history of tax payments. It shows he made three payments in 2017 for tax year 2011; one
payment in 2020 and one payment in 2021 for tax year 2012; two payments in 2019 and
two payments in 2020 for tax year 2014; one payment in 2020 for tax year 2015;  three
payments in 2020 and one payment in 2021 for tax year 2016; two payments in 2020 and
one payment in 2021 for tax year 2017; and one payment in 2020 for tax year 2020. (Tr.
27-35, 41-43, 90-99; AE J; GE 2, 3)
In May 2020, Applicant completed government interrogatories. In them he said he
owed  the  IRS  approximately  $33,298  in  delinquent  taxes.  In  November  2020,  he
completed  another  set  of  government  interrogatories.  In  his  responses,  he  said  his
payment plan covered tax years 2011-2017 and 2019. He further said that he asked an
IRS agent to verify the status of his monthly payments, which were $408 a month, and he
said he was advised by the agent that his payment plan was current. (GE 2, 3)
Applicant  provided  a  March  2021  letter  from  the  IRS  responding  to  his
correspondence from October 2020.  It confirmed that he had requested an installment
agreement in October 2020, and the IRS declined because the amount he proposed was
insufficient to create a full pay installment agreement based on the balance he owed for
tax years 2011-2017, and 2019. The IRS would accept a monthly payment of $297. This
letter contradicts Applicant’s statements in his interrogatories that he was making monthly
payments of $408 on an established payment plan. The history of payments document
that Applicant provided from the IRS does not reflect consistent monthly payments as part
of a plan. None of the payments made were for $408. Applicant completed the installment
agreement form provided by the IRS in May 2021,  in which he indicated that he owed
$30,400 for the previously noted tax years. (Tr. 91-99; Answer to the SOR; AE J)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he attributed his delinquent taxes to his marital
issues and the financial stress placed on his family due to his wife’s gambling. He stated:
I’ve  always  intended  to  pay  my  taxes. Due  to  overwhelming  financial  issues
we   were   on   a   payment  plan.  We   were   scheduled   to   pay   $408   a   month;
recently  after this I made  an  inquiry  about my  taxes. The  IRS  sent me  a  new
amount due  which  is $294  dollars a  month. I set up  auto  payments to  pay
every  month. The  auto  pay  will help  me  be  consistent with  my  payments.
Prior to  this I have  been  making  some  of  my  half  of  the  payments of  around
$200   month.  Adjusting   to   taking   care   of   my   daughters  led   to   some
inconsistencies with  some  payments being  on  time  in  the  past.  (Answer to
SOR)
In  Applicant’s  post-hearing  email,  he  stated  that  he  contacted  the  IRS  after  his
hearing and  was  advised that his payment plan would not start until after his 2020 tax
returns  are  processed.  There  is  a  delay  due  to  the  pandemic.  Applicant  provided  a
document to show he made a $300 payment to the IRS in December 2021, and he intends
to continue to make a monthly payment until the automatic withdrawal begins. He also
stated  that  his  2020  tax  liability  is  approximately  $35,000  because  he  received  a
relocation package and a bonus. (AE I, K)
In  July  2017,  Applicant  completed  an  electronic  Questionnaire  for  Investigation
Processing (e-QIP). He testified that throughout the years he has completed e-QIPs and
is familiar with the process. He confirmed he knew he was required to be truthful under
penalty of law. Section 26 asks: “In the past seven (7) years have you failed to file or pay
Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law of ordinance?” Applicant responded
“no.” (Tr. 100-113; GE 1)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted ¶ 2.a that alleged he falsified his e-
QIP when he responded “no” that he had not failed to timely file or pay his federal taxes.
He stated:
This  was  an   oversite   (sic)  while   filling   out   the   e-QIP.  It   was  never  my
intention  to  falsify  documents about my  financial record  - Taxes in  the  past
seven  (7) years. I have  filled  out a  few  e-QIP  since  2017  and  have  answered
yes to  taxes owed. I fully  understand  even  if  I deliberately  answer no  to  that
question  you  can’t hide  this information. I made  a  mistake  and  didn’t include
my  brother on  a  previous e-QIP. This is another example  of  an  oversight
and  not intentionally  hiding  my  brother who’s mentioned  on  all  of  my e-QIP.
(Answer to SOR)
Applicant testified that his failure to disclose his delinquent tax filings and payments
was a mistake and not intentional.  A copy of his January 2020 e-QIP was produced by
the Government and admitted into evidence (GE 9). It reflects he answered “no” that he
did not fail to timely file or pay his taxes. I did not find Applicant’s testimony credible. I find
he deliberately failed to disclose that he owed delinquent federal taxes for tax years 2014,
2015, 2016, and 2017. (Tr. 27-33, 100-113; GE 1, 9)
Any  derogatory  information  that  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  including  other
delinquent  tax  years,  will  not  be  considered  for  disqualifying  purposes.  It  may  be
considered  when  making  a  credibility  determination,  in  the  application  of  mitigating
conditions, and in a whole person analysis.
Applicant testified that he has not been responsible in the past, but in the future he
will do everything right. He will put things in order and prove he can be responsible. He
intends  to  contact  the  IRS  to  determine  the  status  of  his  agreement.  He  takes  these
matters seriously, and he is not a threat to national security. He believes he is trustworthy.
(Tr. 114-115)
