Applicant admitted SOR allegation ¶ 1.c and denied SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b,
1.d, and 1.e. He is 32 years old. He was born in Afghanistan, immigrated to the United
States in 1989, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2010. He graduated from high
school in 2008 and earned a bachelor’s degree in accounting in 2014. He is unmarried
and he does not have any children. (Answer; Tr. at 17-25; GE 1)
Applicant worked for a previous DOD contractor (company A) from April 2015 until
June 2018.  Since then and as of the date of the hearing, he worked as a data analyst for
his  employer,  also  a  DOD  contractor  (company  B).  He  was  first  granted  a  security
clearance in March 2018. (Answer; Tr. at 6, 17-26, 111-113; GE 1, 3, 7)
The   SOR  alleged   that   Applicant  resigned   from   employment   with   company   A   in
June  2018,  in  lieu  of being  fired, after company  A  concluded  that  he  engaged  in  repeated
unwanted  and  unprofessional communication  with  a  female co-worker  (CW1), even  after
company  A  counseled  him  to  cease  communication, and  that he  is not eligible  for rehire
(SOR ¶  1.a).  The  SOR also alleged  that after Applicant’s 2018  resignation  in lieu  of  firing:
(1) Applicant was seen  in  and  around  the  exterior of  company  A’s headquarters, where
CW1  continued  to  work, on  at least  three  occasions;  he  continued  to  engage  in  unwanted
communication   with   CW1;   and   company   A   consequently   sent  him   a   notice   to   cease
trespassing on its property (SOR ¶ 1.b); and (2) CW1  and  CW1’s spouse reported to the
police  that  they  believed  Applicant  appeared  outside  their  residence,  which  Applicant
denied  upon  police  questioning  but  admitted  that  he  had  sent  CW1  unwanted  text
messages, and the police consequently issued him a trespass notice (SOR ¶ 1.c).
The  SOR also  alleged  that Applicant  falsified  material facts on  his January  2019
security   clearance   application   (SCA),   in  response   to   “Section   13A   -  Employment
Activities,” “Reason  for Leaving.  Provide the reason  for leaving the  employment activity,”
when   he   listed   “[p]rofessional  [g]rowth”  as  the   reason   for  leaving   his  employment   with
company  A  in June 2018.  The  SOR also alleged  that Applicant falsified  his 2019  SCA in
response  to  “Section  13A  - Employment  Activities,” when  he  listed   “No” in response  to
the  following:
Reason   for  Leaving   Question   For  this  employment  have   any   of  the   following
happened  to  you  in the  last  seven  (7) years? . . .  ∙  Quit after being  told you  would
be  fired  ∙  Left  by  mutual agreement following  charges or allegations of  misconduct
. . . .
In truth, the SOR alleged, Applicant resigned from company A in lieu of being fired, as set
forth in SOR ¶ 1.a, and further discussed below. (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e).
The  SOR  allegations  are  established  by  Applicant’s  admissions;  June  2018
employment records from company A; an October 2018 adverse action report, submitted
by company A to the Defense Security Service (DSS); a December 2018 Joint Personnel
Adjudication System (JPAS) incident history report, submitted by company A to the DSS,
concerning an incident that occurred on June 5, 2018; Applicant’s January 2019 SCA; a
March 2019 police report concerning a suspicious event that occurred on June 13, 2018;
reports  of  background  interviews  conducted  in  April  and  May  2019;  and  records  of
Applicant’s communications to CW1 between approximately 2017 and 2019. (Answer; Tr.
at 27-153; GE 1-8)
Applicant and CW 1 became colleagues at company A when she was assigned, in
mid to late 2017, to a project he was working on. Applicant testified that he considered
her,  over  time,  to  be  a  “good  friend,”  but  he  never  pursued  or  had  any  other  kind  of
relationship with her. He acknowledged that in approximately late September 2017, she
requested, in response to a text he sent her, that he stop texting her. He continued to text
her,  from  his  personal  cellular  phone  to  hers,  through  January  2018;  she  never
responded.  When  CW1  contacted  the  police  on  June  13,  2018,  as  further  discussed
below, she  reported  that Applicant had  been  harassing  her at work  “for the  past year.”
(Tr. at 27-52, 113-114; GE 1-7)
Applicant’s  former  supervisors  and  senior  human  resources  staff  at  company  A
instructed  him  to  cease  his  unwanted  social  contact  with  CW1.  Applicant  disregarded
their  instructions  and  continued  his  conduct.  An  October  2018  adverse  action  report,
submitted by company A to the DSS, reflects that Applicant received such instruction over
the  course  of  at  least  four  counseling  sessions.  Applicant  testified  that  he  was  only
counseled once by company A, in mid-January 2018. He testified that during that single
counseling session, he was told only that he should go through a certain manager if  it
involved something with CW1, and he was not explicitly told to cease contact with CW1.
(Tr. at 44-57, 114-121, 142-152; GE 2-8)
A  record  of  a  January  17,  2018  meeting  between  Applicant  and  two  senior
individuals  from  company  A  reflect  that  Applicant  was  informed  that  company  A  was
aware of his communications with CW1, despite CW1’s multiple  requests that he  stop;
CW1 confirmed there was no further need for any professional contact because she and
Applicant were no longer working on the same project; Applicant was informed, and the
two  senior  individuals from  company  A  “further  emphasized  (more  than  3  times),”  that
company A would not tolerate any future contact he made with CW1, and he “would be
expected to part ways and leave [company A]  if he continued  such  contact;” and,  if he
needed  to  contact  CW1  for  professional  reasons,  he  was  expected  to  work  directly
through the two senior individuals from company A that were in attendance at the January
2018  meeting,  and  not  CW1.  The  record  further  reflects  that  Applicant  “confirmed  his
understanding of this expectation and agreed that he would not make any further contact.”
Applicant testified that other than in-person communications with CW1 regarding work, “I
don’t recall like a text, but I don’t think I sent any texts after that meeting, that was non
work related.” The record also contains an undated letter from Applicant to CW1 in which
Applicant acknowledged a potential for his termination from company A if he continued
contacting CW1. He wrote, in part:
I overlooked  your wishes when  I was emotionally  drowning  so  I’m  going  to
ignore it one  more time  and  reach  out to  let you  know  that I cannot stand  on
a  side  knowing  that someone  that  I know  is going  through  grief and I’m not
there to  help or support. I’m  probably  going  to  get fired  for this if  it gets back
to [a  senior individual from  company  A]  or the  .  .  .  team  .  .  .  . Anyway, if I’m
going to be crucified  for caring, then  [sic] be it.
(Tr. at 44-57, 114-121, 142-152; GE 5, 6, 8; AE B)
On  June  5,  2018,  company  A  terminated  Applicant’s  employment  due  to  his
“repeated unwanted non-business contact with [CW1], via social media, telephone and in
person;” at his request, company A permitted him to resign. Applicant maintained that he
voluntarily resigned from employment with company A; he acknowledged that he did so
without providing a two-week notice and that his managers did not inquire as to why he
chose  to  voluntarily  resign.  He  wrote  in  his  resignation  email,  “Ideally,  I  was  in  with
[company  A]  for  the  long  haul.  However[,]  given  the  circumstances[,]  I’m  more  [than]
[willing] to resign from my role.” (Tr. at 53-80, 121-127; GE 2, 3, 5-8)
Applicant testified and indicated during his April 2019 background interview that
he  voluntarily  resigned  because  of  a  misunderstanding  between  him  and  CW1,  about
whom certain team managers made immature comments and which created a workplace
culture over a four to six-month period that he did not want to be involved in, and that
these were the “circumstances” he referenced in his resignation letter. He also testified
and  indicated during his  April 2019  background  interview that  he  left employment  with
company A because his project with company A ended, he was offered an opportunity
with company B in May 2018, and he chose to accept the offer with a start date of June
18, 2018. He testified both that: (1) he did not recall company A ever telling him he was
going to be fired, and (2) company A never told him he was going to be fired. He testified
that at the time he left company A, he believed he was eligible for rehire as he was never
given  any  paperwork  stating  otherwise.  As  such,  Applicant  maintained  that  he  did  not
falsify his responses  to  section  13A  of  his 2019  SCA.  (Answer;  Tr.  at  53-80, 121-127,
142-152; GE 1, 7, 8; AE B)
After he was terminated by company A,  Applicant continued to contact  CW1 on
numerous occasions, via e-mails, text messages, and telephone calls, which she reported
to the police. One email, dated June 12, 2018, contains, in part, the following subject line:
“Didn’t realize friendship requires apologies. I have ask[ed] myself could I love someone
this much . . . ?” CW1 and her spouse also reported to the police on June 13, 2018, that
they  believed  Applicant  appeared  in  his  car  outside  their  residence;  a  police  officer
confirmed  that  the  license  plate  provided  by  CW1’s  spouse  belonged  to  Applicant.
Applicant denied, when questioned by the police and at hearing, that he had driven by
CW1’s residence, but he admitted that he had sent her unwanted text messages. He told
the police, “even though he knew [CW1] didn’t want him to text[,] he didn’t want [CW1] to
think he had abandoned her when he  ‘resigned.’” He testified and indicated during his
April  2019  background  interview  that  he  wanted  closure  from  CW1  as  to  why  she  no
longer wanted contact, it was hard for him to grasp that he had lost a friend due to gossip,
and he wanted to let her know that he did not hold any hard feelings towards her and was
still amenable  to  their friendship. The police issued him a trespass notice  on  June 13,
2018, barring him from CW1’s residence. (Tr. at 80-106, 127-152; GE 2-7)
Following his employment separation from company A, Applicant was seen on at
least  three  occasions  in  and  around  the  exterior  of  company  A’s  headquarters,  where
CW1 continued to work, despite having no known need to be in the area of company A’s
headquarters during normal business hours. He testified that he normally exercised in the
area where company A is located, and his new employer was also located in the same
vicinity. Company A sent him a “No Trespassing” letter via certified mail on June 18, 2018,
notifying him  that he was  banned from all of  its  state-wide  properties,  and  company A
filed a copy of the letter with the police department in the county where its headquarters
is  located.  Applicant  acknowledged  during  his  April  2019  background  interview  that
because he was banned from company A’s property, he was not eligible for rehire with
company A. (Answer; Tr. at 80-106, 127-142; GE 7, 8)
Applicant continued to contact CW1. He testified that he wanted to confirm whether
it  was  her,  and  not  company  A,  who  filed  the  June  13,  2018  trespass  notice,  and  he
wanted to invite her to a housewarming party. He emailed her on July 30, 2018, with the
subject line, “I challenge you.” He emailed her twice in August 2018. He  emailed her in
October 2018, after finding out that she was working for another employer (company C),
to inquire about company C’s hiring event. He emailed her in November 2018, to notify
her that he was running the same marathon he knew she was running. He emailed her in
January and  February 2019.  He  testified that  he  last contacted  CW1 when  one of  her
friends contacted him in around March 2019 and asked him to stop. His communications
with CW1 persisted even after she sent him this text in July 2018:
I don’t want to  talk to  you. I do  not  like  you. We  are not  friends. We  were
never friends. There’s nothing  to  fix. I’ve  made  it crystal clear I can’t stand
you. Leave  me  the  . . .  alone.
(Answer; Tr. at 80-106, 127-152; GE 1-8)
Applicant has not faced any other allegations of misconduct. Although he testified
that “. . . in terms of facing that situation, that probably will never happen again,” he also
stated, “. . . at this point, I’m kind of struggling on how to  -- how to approach a situation
like  that again .  .  .  .”  He felt his intention of being a friend was misconstrued.  A former
supervisor of Applicant from company A, for whom Applicant worked from around 2015
to  2017,  stated  that  he  did  not  have  any  direct,  firsthand  knowledge  of  the  incidents
referenced  in  the  SOR  and  had  never  witnessed  Applicant  engage  in  any  illegal,
inappropriate  or  unprofessional  conduct.  He  described  Applicant  as  a  “solid  and
dependable  performer,”  and  he  did  not  have  any  concerns  with  Applicant’s
trustworthiness  and  ability  to  conduct  himself  professionally.  Another  individual  from
company A, who referred to Applicant as a “business associate” in November 2017, wrote
that she knew Applicant for two years and described him as an “asset” to the team. (Tr.
at 25-27, 106-110; AE A, C).
A  managing  director  at  company  B,  who  referred  to  Applicant  as  a  “business
associate”  in  November  2020,  wrote  that  she  knew  Applicant  for  three  years  and
described him as “helpful,” “reliable,” and “well-respected.” Another managing director at
company  B,  who  was  Applicant’s  previous  direct  supervisor  when  Applicant  started
working for company B and who has maintained “frequent” contact with him, described
Applicant  as  a  “pleasure  to  work  with”  and  an  individual  who  has  “excellent  working
relationships  with  those  at  all  levels  at  [company  B].”  His  “immediate  manager”  as  of
November 2020 referred  to  Applicant as her “most trusted  senior on  the  audit,” and an
individual  of  “exemplary  character.”  Finally,  a  co-worker  from  company  B  wrote,  in
November  2020,  that  he  had  worked  with  Applicant  for  just  over  a  year  and  she
considered him to be a valuable resource to their team. (AE C)
