In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations with explanations.
His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  51-year-old  image  technician  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since November 2014. He served  on active duty in the U.S. Coast Guard from August
1988 to September 1989 and in the U.S. Air Force Reserve from January 1990 to January
1992. He received honorable discharges after each period of military service. He married
in February 1995 and divorced in October 2013. He has three adult children. He has never
held a security clearance.
The  SOR alleges  that Applicant owes $13,685  in  federal income  taxes for  tax  year
2013  and  $13,747  for tax  year 2014  (SOR ¶¶1.a  and  1.b). It  also  alleges that  he  has  a
child-support arrearage  of  $12,590  (SOR ¶  1.c).  Upon  motion  of Department Counsel, I
corrected  a  scrivener’s error in SOR ¶  1.b, which alleged  a  tax  debt  of  “$13,747.59.00,”
by striking the last two zeroes. (Tr. 15.)
Applicant’s SCA reflects that he worked in the private sector from at least February
2003 to November 2014. (GX 1 at 15-21.) He was self-employed from February 2013 to
November  2014,  in  three  separate  businesses  jointly  owned  by  him  and  his  wife.  He
continued to work in the private sector from May 2012 to April 2013, and July to November
2014, but was dependent on income from the three businesses from April 2013 to July
2014.  (Tr.  21-22.)  He  received  20%  of  the  revenue  from  the  businesses,  and  his  wife
received 80%. The businesses failed when they lost their biggest client. He worked in the
private sector from July to November 2014, when he was hired by his current employer.
In  May  2013,  Applicant’s  oldest  daughter  accused  him  of  sexually  abusing  her,
and he was charged with felony sexual activity with a child. The charges were dismissed
and the records expunged after he submitted the results of an exculpatory polygraph. The
record  does  not  reflect  the  entire  factual  basis  for  dismissing  the  charges.  Applicant
incurred  attorney’s  fees  between  $7,000  and  $8,000,  responding  to  his  daughter’s
accusation. (GX 3 at 2.) He paid his attorney by using money that he had saved to pay
taxes.
Applicant had been having marital problems for about three years at the time his
daughter accused him of abusing her. Their daughter moved out of the family home, and
Applicant’s  wife  told  him  that  she  wanted  to  be  with  their  daughter.  Applicant  filed  for
divorce, which was granted in October 2013. He paid for his wife’s attorney fees as well
as his own, totaling about $6,000. (Tr. 45-46.)
Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in February 2016 and received a
discharge in May 2016. The discharged debts were personal consumer debts. (GX 4 at
1; GX 5 at 1; Tr. 49.) The bankruptcy is not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant filed his federal income tax return for 2013 in November 2014. The IRS
account transcript for that year reflects that he owed $13,685, the amount alleged in SOR
¶  1.a.  He  filed  his  federal  income  tax  return  for  2014  in  February  2016,  and  the  IRS
transcript for that year reflects that he owed $13,747, the amount alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b.
Applicant testified that he hired a tax service in 2013. (Tr. 25.) The tax transcripts
reflect appointment of a representative in January 2015, July 2015, August 2015, March
2016,  June  2016,  June  2017,  and  June  2018.  Applicant  testified  that  his  current  tax
service was the only representative that he hired, and that they helped him to be placed
in a non-collectible status. (Tr. 27-28.)
Applicant filed his tax return for 2015 in October 2016, owed $22, and paid it. The
penalty for late filing ($0.63) was written off by the IRS in November 2016. (AX-A.) He
timely filed his federal income tax returns for 2016, 2017, and 2018. For 2016, he received
a $24 credit applied to his tax debt from 2013. He owed $51 for 2017 and $26 for 2018,
which he paid. (GX 2 at 29-32.) He testified that all his tax returns through 2020 have
been filed. (Tr. 34.)
In December 2015, the IRS filed a tax lien against Applicant for $9,303. (GX 4 at
2.) He contacted the IRS in September 2016 regarding his tax debt. In October 2016, the
IRS responded to his inquiry and sent him a letter stating that he owed $22,145 for tax
years 2013, 2014, and 2015, but that his case was closed as non-collectable. The IRS
notified him that it might reopen his case if his financial situation improved. It also notified
him that he could make voluntary payments, and that he might be a candidate for an offer
in compromise. (GX 2 at 8-10.) Applicant testified that he stopped reading the IRS letter
after he read that the debt was non-collectable, and he did not notice the provisions for
voluntary payments, the possibility of an offer in compromise, or the notice that the IRS
might decide to pursue collection if his financial status improved. (Tr. 52-53.) He testified
that his tax service told him that the delinquent taxes would be forgiven after ten years.
(Tr. 26.)
In  April  2020,  Applicant  asked  the  IRS  for  information  about  tax  year  2015.  He
received a written response informing him that the IRS was not able to process his request
at the time. (GX 2 at 27-28.) There is no evidence in the record reflecting a response from
the IRS.
In  October  2020,  Applicant  filed  an  IRS  Form  2848,  Power  of  Attorney  and
Declaration of Representative, listing four attorneys from the same law firm. There is no
evidence reflecting what actions, if any, that the attorneys took to resolve the tax debt.
(AX   C.)   He  testified   that  he   did  not  know   that  his  debt  had   been   removed   from   non-
collectible status  until he  received  the  SOR in February  2021,  called  the  IRS,  and  was
informed  telephonically  by  an  IRS  representative  that  his debt was no  longer in  a  non-
collectible status. (Tr.  30-32.)  There  is no  documentary  evidence  in  the  record reflecting
the  removal of  his tax  debt from  its non-collectible status. In  December 2021, he  contacted
his tax  service for help. A  letter from   the  tax  service recites that it  is “in  the   process of
bringing  [Applicant’s] IRS  account  into  full  compliance  and  negotiating  a  resolution  for the
balances.”  The tax service is hoping for a “formal resolution or compromise” within a few
months.  (AX  B.) (Tr. 31.)  Applicant  testified  that the  tax  service  is waiting  for the  IRS  to
post his return  for 2020. (Tr. 33.)
In  October  2013,  Applicant  was  ordered  by  the  domestic  relations  court  to  pay
$1,393 per month in child support. He was unable to pay that amount, but he paid $100
per  week  and  accumulated  an  arrearage  of  $24,657.  In  August  2019,  the  court
recomputed his obligation, determined that he had made payments in excess of what he
was obligated to pay on the arrearage, and determined that his arrearage was $12,590,
the  amount  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c.  The  court  reduced  his  monthly  payments  on  the
arrearage to $454. (GX 2 at 20-21.) In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he stated that he
had reduced the arrearage to $5,708. At the hearing, he provided documentation that his
child-support arrearage was paid in full in August 2021. (AX D and E.) His children are
now adults.
Since  about  April  2020,  Applicant’s  monthly  net  income  has  been  about  been
about $2,005. His monthly expenses have been about $1,252, leaving a net remainder of
about  $753.  (GX  2  at  7.)  He  lives  with  his  mother  and  drives  a  car  owned  by  his
grandfather.  His  checking  account  has  a  balance  of  about  $500.  He  does  not  have  a
retirement account or any investments. (Tr. 37-38.) He has bank savings of about $4,000.
A credit report dated March 26, 2021, reflects zero balances on all his credit cards.
