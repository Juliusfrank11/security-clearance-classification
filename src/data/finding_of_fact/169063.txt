Applicant  admitted  failing  to  timely  file  his  2017  state  and  Federal  income  tax
returns,  accumulating  about  $2,400  in  state  tax  liability  for  tax  years  2017-2019,  and
about $2,400 in Federal tax liability for tax years 2017-2018 (SOR 1.a-1.g). He denied the
amount  of  child  support  arrears  (SOR  1.h),  documenting  that  the  amount  had  been
reduced to $876, and denied the debt at SOR 1.i as having been paid, which it had been
in January 2020 [Answer (Item 3)].
Applicant  is  a  31-year-old  engineering  technician  employed  by  a  U.S.  defense
contractor since January 2019. Before  that employment, he  had been employed  since
June 2008 in a series of low skill, low wage jobs, interrupted occasionally by periods of
varying-length unemployment. He has never married, although he is currently engaged,
and has an eight-year-old daughter from a prior relationship. He has not previously held
a clearance (Item 4).
Applicant disclosed  on  his security  clearance  application  his failures to  file  and  pay
his 2017  tax  returns (SOR 1.a-1.b), his delinquent child  support (SOR 1.h), and  the  SOR
1.i debt (for which he  claimed  to  have  been  in a  payment plan). The  SOR 1.i debt had
been  reduced  to  judgment,  apparently  being  enforced  by  garnishment.  However, the  SOR
debt amount alleged  was only  $24, and  Applicant documented  his January  2020  payment
(Item  3) paying  off  the  account.  Applicant discussed  his failures to  file and  pay, and  all
the  SOR debts, during  his August 2019  interview  with  a  Government investigator (Item
5), based on his July 2019 credit report (Item  6). He attributed  his failure to timely file his
state  and  Federal income  tax  returns for 2017  to  not getting  his tax  information  from  his
two  employers that  year. He stated  that  he  had  not gotten  these  records until April or  May
2019, and  intended  to  file  this delinquent return during  the  2020  tax  season, more than
six  months  away. His child  support  issues  arose  because,  while  he  was with  the  child’s
mother when  his  daughter was born in  September  2013,  they  were not  together when  the
mother  filed   for  child   support  in  May   2014,  and   when   child   support  is  awarded
retroactively,  there  is  initially   never  a   time   when   the   payer  is  not  delinquent,  and   the
enforcement   system   garnishes  the   payer’s  wages,  including   an   amount  for  arrears.
Nevertheless,  Applicant’s Answer documents his regular payments  and  reduction  of  his
outstanding arrears.
In his Answer, Applicant stated he filed the missing returns in July 2020, however,
he did not fax his returns to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the state until after
he received the SOR in November 2020. His Answer states he used his fiancée’s credit
cards  to  pay  his  tax  debts,  and  his  fiancée  states  that  Applicant  repaid  the  amounts
advanced (Response).
Applicant’s  sole  character  reference  (Response)  praises  Applicant’s  work,  but
evinces  no  knowledge  of  the  SOR  issues.  He  documented  no  credit  or  financial
counseling,  and  did  not  submit  a  budget.  He  provided  no  evidence  of  community
involvement, or other evidence to support a whole-person analysis.
