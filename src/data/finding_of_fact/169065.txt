1.d  ($6,195). He denied  all  of  the  remaining  SOR allegations (SOR  ¶¶ 1.c,  1.e  through

SOR ¶ 1.a  ($9,453)  concerns a car loan. In 2019, he totaled the car in an accident.
After that, he claimed he could not afford to continue making the loan payments for a car
he no longer had. He stated he needed to take care of his wife, who was pregnant at the
time. As of his hearing date, he had not made written contact with the creditor to settle,
pay, or resolve the debt. He intends to resolve the debt sometime in future. He averred
that in 2020, he contacted the creditor asking for a possible settlement. He was asked to
submit his request in writing, and he never did.
SOR ¶ 1.b  ($8,662) concerns a car repossession. Applicant purchased a car. In
2013, he voluntarily surrendered it to the creditor because he could not afford to continue
making the payments. The creditor charged off the debt. The account remains delinquent.
After 2013, he did not contact the creditor to settle, pay, or resolve the debt. (Tr. 47-48)
SOR ¶ 1.c  ($6,5622)  concerns a loan Applicant stated he made in 2013 to support
his family and later failed to repay. He has not contacted the creditor to resolve the debt,
and the debt remains delinquent. (Tr. 47-48)

account remains delinquent. (Tr. 48-49)
SOR  ¶  1.e   ($2,463)  concerns  furniture  Applicant  claimed  his  wife  purchased
without  his  knowledge.  He  claimed  not  knowing  about  this  account  until  2020.  The
account  was  charged  off  in  2017.  He  testified  he  contacted  the  creditor  three  weeks
before  his  hearing  (after  receipt  of  the  SOR)  to  resolve  the  debt.  He  was  offered  a
settlement for about $1,200, but he did not have the financial means to take the offer. The
account remains delinquent. (Tr. 49-50)
SOR  ¶  1.f  ($50)  alleges  a  delinquent  account  for  communication  services  that
Applicant denied and claimed he disputed. After the hearing, he submitted documentary
evidence showing he paid the debt on October 14, 2021. (AE D) He also established a
payment  schedule  for  another  debt  with  the  same  creditor,  agreeing  to  pay  $179  in

(Tr. 52)
SOR  ¶  1.i  ($1,158)  alleges  a  2012  delinquent  account  to  a  communications
services provider that Applicant denied and claimed it was not his account. The debt is
established  by  the  credit  reports  in  evidence.  Applicant  claimed  he  had  the  same
communications services provider until recently, when he exchanged providers, and was
not delinquent. He failed to submit documentary evidence to corroborate his claim.
SOR  ¶  1.j  ($2,828)  alleges  a  delinquent  child-support  obligation  placed  for
collection. During his hearing, Applicant denied being in arrears or being delinquent in his
support obligation. After the hearing, Applicant submitted documentary evidence from his
state’s child support enforcing agency showing his payment record between November
2018  and  November  2021.  (AE  B)  During  the  period  of  the  report,  Applicant  was
sometimes current and other times delinquent. As of November 2021, he was $1,207 in
arrears.
SOR  ¶ 1.k   ($1,226) alleges  a delinquent account to a  communications  services
provider that Applicant denied and claimed it was not his account. The debt is established
by  the  credit  reports  in  evidence.  Applicant  claimed  he  had  another  communications
services provider until recently, and then he changed to the provider alleged in SOR  ¶
1.k. He averred  he  did  not know  he  was delinquent on  his account. He failed  to  submit
documentary evidence to corroborate his claim.
SOR  ¶  1.l  ($409)  alleges  a  delinquent  account  to  a  communications  services
provider that Applicant denied and claimed it was not his account. The credit reports in
evidence establish it as Applicant’s account and  show he stopped making payments on
2018.
The  Government  questioned  Applicant  about  three  delinquent  accounts  not
alleged in the SOR. The first is for $217 to a power company. Applicant claimed he paid
it  during  the  summer  of  2017.  After  the  hearing,  he  submitted  documentary  evidence
showing  he  paid  it  on  October  25,  2021.  The  second  is  a  $3,691  debt  to  a
telecommunications services provider. Applicant admitted it was his account and that it
was  unresolved.  (Tr.  59-60)  The  third  is  a  debt  for  $594  owed  to  a  communications
services provider. The account is unresolved.
At his hearing, Applicant testified he did not have a written budget, but claimed he
was following a budget. Post-hearing, he submitted a written budget showing a $5,409
monthly  income,  monthly  expenses  of  $4,395,  and  $1,000  remainder.  (AE  A)  He
presented no evidence to show he has participated in financial counseling.
financial  problems
Applicant  attributed  his
to  unemployment  and
underemployment after his discharge from the military, his divorce from his first wife, and
his  separation  from  his  current  wife.  With  the  exception  of  the  garnishment,  Applicant
presented no evidence of any payments made toward the debts alleged in the SOR, until
after he was issued the SOR. None of his payments predate his hearing. He stated that
he was concentrating on paying the child-support garnishment, providing support for his
other children, and the loan for his current car. He implied that his income is insufficient
to  pay  for  his  living  expenses  and  delinquent  debts.  Applicant  testified  that  when  he
approached his creditors seeking a settlement, he was asked for large sums of money
that he could not afford.
Applicant  admitted  that  letting  his  finances  suffer  was  a  careless  and  an
irresponsible thing to do. He stated:
I put myself in  a  lot  of bad  positions.  I've  allowed  relationships to  take  the
best  of me.  I  allowed  my  emotions,  as  far as  being  relationships,  to  take  the,
to  get the  best of me.  I wanted  to  make  sure  I took care of my  family  first
. . . . I was just  trying  to  take  care of  family.  Making  sure I get them  in  order.
Putting  things  on  the  back burner,  and  then, forgetting  about  it.  Not  getting
back to  it  in time.  And  then, just  I wasn't  keeping  a  budget.  I  didn't have  a
budget  in order.  And  I  just I  allowed  myself to get really  irresponsible  when
it came to a lot  of money things.  (Tr. 63)
Applicant expressed his desire to resolve his financial problems. He stated that he
takes  his  financial  problems  seriously.  He  understands  the  seriousness  of  having
negative information on his credit. He noted that the Army and the federal contractors he
has worked for have trusted him with a clearance. He believes that he has establish that
he  is  trustworthy  and  can  be  issued  a  clearance.  He  promised  to  resolve  his  financial
situation in the near future.
