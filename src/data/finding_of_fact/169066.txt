Applicant, age 52, married his second wife in 2017. He divorced his first wife of 23
years in 2016. He has four children of his first marriage, three adults and one minor. He
has  four  adult  stepchildren  of  his  second  marriage.  His  educational  history  was  not
indicated in the record. He has been employed by a defense contractor as an application
developer since 2010, when his initial security clearance was granted. He was previously
employed by another employer as a programmer from 2004 through 2010. (Item 3)
The  SOR  alleged  16  delinquent  debts  totaling  $47,715,  including  two  federal
income tax accounts totaling $9,929, nine federal student loan accounts totaling $35,086,
three medical accounts totaling $1,506, and two consumer accounts totaling $1,194. In
his SOR answer, Applicant admitted each alleged debt. (Items 1, 2)
Applicant attributed his delinquent debts to his 2016 divorce and 2017 marriage.
He stated: “My life was turned upside down during those couple of years. Some  things
slipped through the cracks during  that  time.  It’s not an  excuse.”  He did not proffer any
details concerning his income or expense history. (Item 3 at 34, 36)
In   his August  2019  SCA,   Applicant  addressed   the   debts  alleged   in   SOR  ¶¶   1.e
though  1.p, but not  the  debts alleged  in SOR ¶¶  1.a  through  1.d. He  planned  to  contact
the  creditor “within the  next couple  of months”  to  resolve  the  medical debt  alleged  in  SOR
¶  1.e,  which he  attributed  to  treatment  for one  of his children. He  was “working  with  the
IRS  to  get everything  paid and  current,” and  planned  to  take  out a  personal loan  to  pay
his  tax   debt   if   the   IRS   did   not  accept  a   payment  plan.   He   maintained   that  he   was  not
aware of  his student loan  debt until he  received  a  letter from  his  lender that  his balance
had  been  paid via a  wage  garnishment.  He claimed  that he  had  neither noticed  that his
wages  had   been   garnished   nor  received   any   notification   of  the   garnishments   until  he
reviewed  his pay  stubs  upon  receipt of that letter. He  verified  the  garnishments,  but did
not  indicate   the   amount  garnished.  He   acknowledged   that  there  remained   a   balance
owed,  and   planned   to   contact   the   collection   agency   to   whom   the   U.S.  Department  of
Education  had  transferred the  accounts to set up a payment arrangement.  (Item 3  at 34-
40)
Applicant asserted in his August 2019 SCA that he had been rebuilding his credit
and  paying  off  his  debt  “on  [his]  own,”  but  planned  to  look  into  working  with  a  credit
counseling service to help “maximize” his and his wife’s credit scores so that they could
buy a home in 2019. He maintained that his credit score had gone up 115 points and that
he was using only two credit cards, the balances of which he paid in full each month. His
January 2021 credit report showed two active credit cards in current status with minimal
balances, but no mortgage account. It also revealed a reduced balance of $803 for the
consumer debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a ($1,105), and higher balances for each of the student
loan  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.f  through  1.n,  which  then  totaled  $35,928.  The  debts
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.e did not appear in the credit report. (Item 3 at 36)
In  about  November  2019,  Applicant  engaged  the  services  of  debt  resolution
company to assist him with resolving his tax and student loan debts. He provided copies
of related disclosure forms and email correspondence, dated November 2019. However,
he did not proffer any details about the progress, if any, he made on resolving those debts
either through the debt resolution company or otherwise. (Item 4)
Applicant  was  disciplined  by  his  employer  in  2016  for  violating  the  terms  of  his
company  credit  card.  He  charged  approximately  $2,000  on  the  card,  which  was
apparently not authorized by his company. He stated: “I was going through a divorce. I
had put travel expenses on the card. My ex wife [sic] cleaned out the bank account, so I
was unable to pay it when it was due.” He paid the balance due eventually, just not on
time. His employer revoked his credit card as a result. (Item 3 at 35-36, 38-39).
