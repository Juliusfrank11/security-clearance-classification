Applicant,  40,  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  federal  contracting
company,  as  an  avionics  technician  since  May  2019.  He  is  required  to  maintain  a
license with the Federal Aviation Administration to work in his chosen field. Although he
was  granted  access  to  classified  information  during  his  military  service  between  June
1999  and  June  2004,  his  previous  employment  did  not  require  access.  Applicant
completed  his  most  recent  security  clearance  application  in  May  2019,  in  which  he
disclosed  a  2018  job  termination  after  testing  positive  for  marijuana  during  a  random
urinalysis, and that he had used marijuana from November 2004 to November 2018. He
also disclosed his failure to timely file his federal income taxes in 2017, and that he had
seven delinquent accounts.  (Tr. 20; GE 1; AE C)
Financial Concerns
Applicant admits to living beyond his means in the past, using credit cards and a
personal  loan  to  fund  his  lifestyle.  Between  2015  and  2018,  he  admits  to  incurring
$5,880  in  delinquent  debt.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  –  1.c)  He  also  admitted  to  failing  to  file  his
federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  in  2017  (SOR  ¶  1.c  –  1.d).  In  2019,  Applicant
withdrew funds from his retirement accounts to address his delinquent accounts, except
for  the  charged-off  accounts  on  his  credit  report.  He  realized  that  the  charged-off
accounts  remained  a concern  to  the  Government  when  he  received  the SOR.  (Tr. 22,
25-26, 29, 58, 61-62; GE 2-5)
Applicant  owes  the   same   creditor   for   the   accounts   alleged   in   SOR  ¶¶   1.a   and
1.b.   The   creditor   agreed   to   settle   both   accounts  for  less   than   the   amounts  owed   and
also agreed  to  allow  Applicant to  pay  the  settlement amount through  installment plans.
According   to   receipts   from   the   creditor,  he   satisfied   the   terms   of   the   installment
agreements in  September 2021. (AE  E-F, N-Q) Applicant resolved  the  account alleged
in SOR ¶1.c,  a personal loan, in January 2021. (Tr. 22-24; 26-30; Answer; AE G)
Applicant  blamed  his failure  to  timely file his 2017 federal and  state  income  tax
returns  on  his  concern  that  he  would  owe  an  additional  tax  liability  that  he  could  not
afford. Although he timely filed for an extension of the filing deadline, he did not file the
returns as required.  He filed the federal income tax return in April 2020 and did not owe
any  additional  taxes.  He  filed  the  state  income  tax  return  in  January  2021  and  owed
$363.00,  which  he  paid  upon  filing  the  return.  Since  2017,  he  has  timely  filed  federal
and  state  income  returns.  There  is  no  evidence  of  any  current  outstanding  federal  or
state tax liabilities. (Tr. 30-35, 62-63, 72-73; GE 2; AE H-I)
Applicant  has  reformed  his financial  habits. Between  April and  July of  2019,  he
worked  with  a  credit  repair company.  He  separated from his wife of  12  years in 2015.
She  left  the  marital  home  in  2018.  Applicant  has  primary  physical  custody  and  sole
financial responsibility for his two minor children.  He does not receive any child support
from his estranged wife. He uses a budget and has established a system that makes it
more  difficult  for  him  to  spend  money  impulsively.  He  currently  earns  approximately
$87,000 annually and lives within his means. (Tr. 24, 59, 63-66)
Drug Use
Under  the  substance  abuse  and  misuse  guideline,  the  SOR  alleges  that
Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from  November  2004  to  November
2018 (SOR ¶ 2.a), and that Applicant was terminated from a job in 2018 after he tested
positive for marijuana use (SOR ¶ 2.c). He admits both allegations. (Answer; GE 2)
Applicant began using marijuana after his discharge from military service in 2004.
Initially,  he  used  the  drug  recreationally  with  his  friends.  Between  2004  and  2010,  he
used the drug approximately six times per year. He decreased his use of marijuana in
2010  after  learning  that  he  and  his  wife  were  expecting  their  first  child.  In  2012,  he
began  working  with  a  company  that  had  a  zero  tolerance  drug  policy.  He  was  also
aware  that  any  illegal  drug  use  jeopardized  his  FAA  license.  He  would  use  the  drug
during  periods  when  he  was  away  from  work,  using  no  later  than  72  hours  before  he
was scheduled to return to work. He believed that by employing this strategy, he would
not  report  for  work  under  the  influence  of  the  drug;  however,  he  was  aware  that  he
would  test  positive  for  the  substance.  Between  2010  and  2018,  Applicant  used
marijuana three to four times per year. (Tr. 35, 47, 50-53, 56, 68)
Applicant  began  to  use  marijuana  to  self-medicate  difficult  emotions  between
2015 and 2018, when he and his wife separated but continued to cohabitate.  In 2016,
he was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. As a result, he attended six
weeks of court-ordered counseling. On his own, he continued individual  counseling for
another year until November 2018. (Tr. 48, 53-55, 70-71)
In  November  2018,  a  random  urinalysis  showed  Applicant  tested  positive  for
marijuana use. He was terminated from his job. As part of his termination package, his
employer  provided  him  with  the  steps  he  needed  to  take  to  prevent  losing  his  FAA
license.  He  completed  a  marijuana  awareness  course  in  December  2018  and  his
license remains in good standing. (Tr. 36, 38, 40, 66-69, 71, 73)
Applicant has not used marijuana since November 2018. He vows never to use
the  drug  again  and  has  signed  a  statement  of  intent  to  that  effect.  In  June  2021,
Applicant  submitted  to  a  psychological  screening  by  a  licensed  psychologist.  After
interviewing  Applicant  and  administering  a  series  of  tests,  the  psychologist  concluded
that Applicant does not have a current substance abuse problem. (Tr. 37 -38, 40)
In  terms  of  his  ability  to  handle  and  protect  classified  information,  the
psychologist opined:
In  general, he  follows rules and  law, but has had  a  few  lapses of  judgment
in the  past,  relatively  minor instances of problematic behaviors. This is not
indicative  of a  pattern of  behavior, as  there are no  signs of an  underlying
anti-authority   attitude   or  an   attempt  to   subvert  rules.  He  has   had   a
lackadaisical attitude  towards rules in the  past,  but has learned to be  more
conscientious and is at low risk to repeat  these mistakes. . . .
[Applicant]   does  not   have   any   emotional,   mental,   or  behavioral  (alcohol
use) problem  at this time  that would impair  his judgment or behavior. His
previous  alcohol  and   marijuana   use   did   not   affect   his   work  or
relationships.  In   the   context  of  his  entire   life,  these   were  circumscribed,
isolated  incidents. He has learned  from  these  experiences, and  is honest,
completes   with   the   rules,   has  good   judgment,   and   as   a   good   ability   to
control impulses and protect classified information.   (AE J)
Applicant  is  performing  well  at  his  current  job,  his  performance  meeting  the
expectations  of  his  employers.  Applicant  testified  remorsefully  about  his  history  of
marijuana use and acknowledges that it is incompatible with his current responsibilities
and lifestyle. He also acknowledges that any future marijuana use would not only mean
the   inability   to   obtain   or  maintain  a   security   clearance   in   the   future,   but  that   future
marijuana   use   would   cause   the   loss  of  his  professional  license,  making   him
unemployable   in  his  field.   He   has  made   lifestyle  changes  to   support  sobriety   and   has
drawn   a   boundary   with   his  friends   prohibiting   marijuana   use   in   his  presence.   He   has
developed  better coping  strategies for stress and  difficult  emotions.  (Tr.  37, 39-40, 42-
45, 49, 67, 75-79; AE  C)
