Applicant is 61 years old and has a Juris Doctor degree and a Master of Science
in Foreign Service degree. She is married and has one adult son. Since February 2013,
she has worked for a defense contractor. Applicant is seeking to obtain eligibility to occupy
a  position  of  public  trust,  because  her  sponsor  provides  educational  services  to  the
Department of  Defense. Eligibility is necessary, because a job with her sponsor would
involve access to sensitive but unclassified information. (Item 3.)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged 10 delinquent debts totaling $91,969. (Item
1.)  Applicant  denied  those  debts.  In  her  defense,  Applicant  cited  the  2008-2009
recession,  illnesses,  hospitalizations,  and  deaths  of  family  members.  Those  events
coalesced to contribute to the financial straits reflected in the SOR. Applicant also claimed
that during the recession and her family hardships, her creditors charged usurious interest
rates and penalties. She answered that any amounts that are due her creditors are barred
or extinguished by the statute of limitations. (Item 2 and Applicantâ€™s Response.) Applicant
has no intention of contacting her creditors, because by doing so she might lose the bar
of the statute of limitations. (Item 4.) Many of the SOR debts persist to this day. (Items 6
and 7.) Applicant provided no documents in response to the SOR or the FORM.
