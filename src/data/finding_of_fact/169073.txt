Applicant is a 59-year-old radiological control technician employed by a defense
contractor  since  May  2019.  She  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  October
1981  to  July  1982  and  in  the  U.S.  Army  Reserve  until  July  1987.  She  received  an
honorable  discharge.  She  worked  for  various  non-federal  employers  from  at  least
November 2012 until she was laid off in June 2018. She was unemployed until she was
hired by her current employer. She has never held a security clearance.
Applicant married in May 1985, divorced in November 1990, married in June 1992,
October 1995, divorced in November 1990, married in June 1992, and divorced in April
1995.  She  married  her  current  spouse  in  October  1995.  She  received  an  associate’s
degree in July 2006. She has two adult children.
The SOR alleges seven delinquent medical bills (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.g) that are reflected
in credit reports from February 2020 and November 2019. (GX 3 and 4.) The medical bills
were  incurred  after  she  was  diagnosed  with  a  brain  tumor  in  2008,  and  the  costs  of
medical  treatment  were  not  fully  covered  by  her  medical  insurance.  (GX  5  at  6.)  The
medical accounts alleged SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.g were referred to the same collection agency.
Appellant contacted the collection agency in 2019, before she received the SOR,
and began making payments. She initially paid the collection agency $25 per month but
then increased the amount as other bills were paid off. The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-
1.g have been paid in full. (AX E, F, and G.)
Appellant  initially  thought  that  the  $603  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  had  been
referred to the same collection agency. When she discovered that it was not included,
she began making payments directly to the original creditor. On October 14, 2021, she
paid $300 on the debt alleged in SOR 1.a, and she agreed to pay the balance in six $64
installments. (AX D; AX P; Tr. 36-40.)
Applicant  received  Social  Security  disability  pay  of  $1,500  per month  when  she
was unable to work due to her brain tumor.  During a personal subject interview  with a
security investigator in December 2019, she told the investigator that she returned to work
part  time  in  2014  and  reported  her  employment  to  the  Social  Security  Administration
Office (SSAO), but the disability payments were not terminated, resulting in the $38,988
debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h. She believed that she was entitled to disability pay for nine
months after returning to work full time, but she continued to receive it for an additional
year. After she was notified in September 2016 that she had been overpaid, she made
arrangements to repay it. She testified that she was unaware that she was being overpaid
until she received a letter from the SSAO notifying her of the overpayment. (GX 5 at 6;
Tr. 46-49.) She began repaying the overpayment at $250 per month until she was laid off
in June 2018. Now that she is employed, she has resumed payments at the rate of $100
per month. (AX C, H through O, and Q.)
