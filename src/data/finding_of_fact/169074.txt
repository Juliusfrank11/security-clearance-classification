Applicant denied all the allegations except SOR ¶ 1.a, which he admitted. After a
review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He began  working
for his current employer as a permanent employee  in 2015. He is a network engineer.
He  served  in  the  U.S.  Marine  Corps,  beginning  in  1990,  before  being  honorably
discharged for medical reasons after over two years of service. He has a twenty percent
Department  of  Veterans’  (VA)  Affairs  disability  rating.  He  is  twice  divorced  (most
recently in 2018) and has two adult daughters. (Tr. at 6, 37, 41; GE 1)
The SOR alleged that in 2019, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy action that
was discharged the same year; that Applicant failed to timely file his 2009-2015 federal
tax returns; that he failed to timely file his state tax returns for tax years 2009-2015; and
that  he  owes  $5,733  toward  his  delinquent  federal  tax  debt  and  $3,479  toward  his
delinquent state tax debt (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.e).
Applicant’s  financial  difficulties  began  in  approximately  2011,  when  he  left  a
contractor job in another state  because he  could not afford  to  live there and make his
child support payments to his children who lived in another state. From 2011 to January
2015,  he  experienced  either  short-term  employment  or  periods  of  unemployment.  In
2008, he divorced his first wife. Under the terms of their property settlement, his ex-wife
was to refinance several debts, including the mortgage on the martial home, within one
year so the debts would no longer be attributed to Applicant. Despite Applicant’s filing a
Motion to Enforce, for which he received a judgment, his ex-wife still did not refinance
the  debts.  Applicant  filed  his  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  primarily  to  rid  himself  of  those
martial financial obligations. A recent credit report indicates that he is current on all his
consumer debt. (Tr. at 38, 52; SOR Answer (¶ 1.A); GE 5)
Applicant  admitted  in  both  of  his  security  clearance  applications  (SCA)  and
during his background investigation interview with a defense investigator that he failed
to  timely  file  his  2009-2015  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns.  He  claimed  several
reasons  for  his  dilatory  action  including  that  his  second  wife  always  handled  their
finances, including taking care of their taxes, and when they divorced in 2008, he was
unprepared to take over that responsibility.  Also, he mistakenly believed that if he was
paying his taxes through payroll withholding and he was paying more than he ended up
owing, he did not have to file a tax return. He also did not know that any tax refund he
might be owed was forfeited if he failed to file his returns and failed to claim the refund
within three years of when it arose.  In what was essentially a state of mental paralysis,
he procrastinated taking any action. He finally contacted a tax preparation service which
prepared and allegedly filed his bulk federal and state tax returns for years 2009-2015 in
either  2016  or  2017  (he  testified  that  the  filing  was  in  2016,  but  his  statement  to  the
defense  investigator  claims  it  was  in  2017).  He  testified  that  the  primary  reason  for
finally  acting  on  his  tax  situation  was  because  he  realized  the  impact  it  had  on  his
security clearance after he completed his SCA. Despite being given the opportunity until
October  2021
to  produce
documentation showing that the tax returns for tax years 2009-2014 were filed with the
federal and state tax authorities (the record shows that he filed his 2015 federal return
late  in  2017).  Applicant  produced  documentary  evidence  showing  that  he  has  timely
filed his federal tax returns for tax years 2016-2020. (Tr. at 42-45, 50, 55, 57, 65, 74; GE
3; AE B-E)
to  submit  post-hearing  evidence,  Applicant
failed
Applicant  documented  that  he  has  paid  all  his  delinquent  tax  debt  to  both  the
state and federal tax authorities. He showed the payments that he made in June 2020.
He also presented documentation from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) stating that
as of August 2021 he owed $0. The documentation from the state showed that he had a
credit of $150 as of August 2021. (Tr. at 46, 49, 65; SOR Answer (attachments))
Applicant  presented   testimony   from   three   of   his  supervisors  (1st,  2nd,  and   3rd
level). All  of  them  were aware of the  SOR allegations. All  three  hold  security  clearances
and   are   aware  of  the   requirements  and   responsibilities  for  those   holding   or  seeking
clearances.  Applicant   was  universally   described   by   these   supervisors  as   hardworking,
dependable,   honest,   loyal,  and   trustworthy.  None   of  the   supervisors   had   any
reservations about Applicant holding a security clearance. (Tr. at 20-25, 27-28, 31-34)
Applicant  also  presented  multiple  written  character  recommendations.  All
express  their  belief  in  Applicant’s  integrity,  responsibility,  and  reliability.  They  believe
that he is an asset to their company. Several specifically recommend that he receive a
security clearance. (AE A)
