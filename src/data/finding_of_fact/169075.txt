Applicant admitted the allegations at SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 2.a, and SOR ¶¶ 4.a – 4.g,
all without further comment. He denied the allegations at SOR ¶¶ 3.a, 4.h, 4.i, and 4.j,
all with narrative explanations. He did not answer SOR ¶ 2.b, but it is a cross-allegation
of subparagraphs ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, both of which he admitted. Applicant’s admissions and
explanations  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 48 years old. He has never married and he has no children. (Tr. 52)
He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1996. He has taken subsequent graduate classes and
is about four credits shy of a master’s degree. (Tr. 53, 63; GE 3 at 11-12)
Applicant’s  employment  history   is  detailed   in  security   clearance   applications
(SCAs)  he   submitted   in  connection   with   his  employment,  in   January   2010   (GE   1),
February  2015  (GE  2),  and  January  2018  (GE  3)  and  an  SF-85P  application  for  a
position  of  public  trust  in  September  2018.  (GE  5)  Applicant  also  submitted  a
Declaration for Federal Employment (DFE) in September 2018. (GE 4)
From 2007 until July 2012, Applicant worked in various classified positions with a
variety  of  defense  contractors.  (GE  1  at  17-22,  46,  GE  2  at  15)  He  has  held  various
positions  in  the  IT  field,  mostly  as  a  contractor,  in  the  years  since.  Since  July  2017,
Applicant  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  and  clearance  sponsor,  defense
contractor  S.  (GE  5  at  10)  He  has  held  a  clearance  for  about  15  years,  and  he  also
holds a clearance with another government agency (AGA). (Tr. 13, 53-54, 141-142) At
the time of the hearing, he had an annual salary of $120,000. (Tr. 143)
From   July   2012   to   July   2013,  Applicant  worked   for  another  department  of  the
U.S.  Government  as   an   information   security   specialist.  He  testified   that   he   had
nationwide   responsibility   for  IT  security   regarding   the   Affordable   Care   Act   (ACA),
working   with  each  of  the  50  states.   He described  the  experience  as “a nightmare.” He
had  no  prior government experience,  and  little  to  no  support. He said he   had  “no  idea
what to  do.”  He missed  deadlines and  acknowledged  that  he  “failed  to  perform  up  to  the
expectations”   of  the   job.  He   said   it   was  “completely   my   fault.”  (Tr.  55-57)   Following   a
written   warning   in  January   2013,  Applicant  was  terminated   from   that  position   in  July
2013  for unsatisfactory  performance.  (SOR ¶¶  4.f,  4.g)  (GE 2  at 13-14) As Department
Counsel  acknowledged,  the   “internet  rollout”   of   the   ACA  had   significant  problems,  as
was  widely   publicized   at  the   time, and  Applicant  was  by   no   means  solely   responsible.
(Tr.  98-99)  Applicant  said  he   did  not   have   any   personality   conflicts,   and   praised   the
interpersonal and  professional skills of his co-workers there. (Tr. 99-100)
Shortly   thereafter,  in   July   2013,   Applicant  began   working   for  government
contractor   C.  He   said  he   loved   his   job,   which  involved   travelling   to   Army   bases
nationwide   and   testing   IT   equipment.   He  also  said   the   job   was  in  a   very   stressful
environment  with   lots  of   travel  and   little  sleep.  He  said  he   did  not  get  along   with   his
boss. Following  two  written  warnings, in September 2013  and  December 2013  (SOR ¶¶
4.f, 4.e), Applicant was placed  on  a  probationary  performance  plan. In  about April 2014,
he  and  his boss got into  a  heated  argument.  Applicant was  terminated  soon  thereafter
for failing  to  perform  to  expectations and  for losing  his temper. (SOR ¶  4.c) (GE  2  at 12-
13,  GE   7;  Tr.  58-59,  101-102)  He  did  not  dispute   his  employer’s  version   of   his  work
performance. (Tr. 60)  He believes they were looking to get him  to resign. (Tr. 101-102)
In   June   2014,  Applicant  began   working   part   time  for another federal  contractor,
T.  (GE   2   at  11;  Tr.  60-62,  107-110)  Beginning   in  December  2015,  he   also   began
working   full   time   for  another  contractor,  M.   (Tr.  61-62)  He   worked   both   jobs  until  July
2017, when  he  was terminated  by  contractor T for unsatisfactory  performance,  after he
missed   some   important  deadlines  for  the   customer  (another  large   defense   contractor)
because   he   did  not  have   enough   time   to   devote   to   the   work.   (SOR  ¶   4.a)  (Tr.  61-62,
110-112)  However, Applicant was otherwise well-regarded  by  contractor T.  (Tr. 110-112
and  AE  E, a July 2017  letter from the  president of contractor T)
Guideline K:
In May 2017, Applicant was working for contractor M at an Army facility. He said
he  was  not  in  a  “SCIF”  (Sensitive  Compartmented  Information  Facility)  but  did  have
access to what he  called  a  “simulated” SIPRNet, which he asserted had not been fully
accredited. (Tr. 108-109; Answer) While there, he received an unclassified e-mail from
Ms. M, his government supervisor, the contractor office’s representative (COR). (Tr. 44)
The e-mail listed all of the names of the systems within the lab that were supported by
his  then  employer.  Some  of  the  systems  processed  classified  information.  The  e-mail
was  labeled  as  “unclassified,”  but  the  spreadsheet  document  contained  the  names  of
some  classified  systems.  (Tr.  36)  Applicant  was  supposed  to  complete  appropriate
“patches” for that particular week on the document and then return it to Ms. M, per her
instructions, which he did. (Tr. 36, 46; Answer)
Applicant  acknowledged  in  his  testimony  that  he  should  have  encrypted  the  list
when he returned it, but he said the list was also not encrypted when he got it. “I didn’t
think it needed to be encrypted because of the publically available information and there
was  no  classified  information  in  the  e-mail.”  (Tr.  47)  He  said  that  he  believes  that  the
COR  should  have  known  that  “she  was  setting  someone  up  for  aggregation”  of
classified information. (Tr. 48)
Applicant  also  denied  that any classified  spillage  took  place, because  “nowhere
within  the  SEC  community  classification  guide  does  it  say  that  the  names  of  any
classified  systems  were  themselves  classified.” (Tr.  42)  This assertion  is unsupported.
He  said  it  was  the  aggregation  of  certain  information  that  was  classified.  (Tr.  43)  He
denied moving any classified information onto an unclassified system. (Tr. 44; Answer)
Applicant  said  he   was  he   was  “accused   of   committing   aggregated   spillage.”  He
indicated   in   his  testimony   and   in   his  Answer  that   he   was  pressured   to   sign   a   security
form   acknowledging   culpability   for  the   spill.  (Answer)   He  believes  he   was  “intimidated
into  telling  the  government that it was my  fault and  [that]  I’ll  never do  it again.” (Tr. 37,
48) The security form referenced  by Applicant is not in evidence.
The  Government’s  evidence  includes  a  May  10,  2017  memo  from  the  Army
command to Applicant’s employer that names Applicant as “the originator of a classified
spillage  that  occurred  on  5  May  2017.”  (GE  8  at  3;  GE  8  at  6)  In  its  memo,  the  Army
Information  Assurance,
cited  Army  Regulation  25-2,
Paragraph  4-14,  Personnel  Security  Standards;  subparagraph  b.(6):  “New,  credible,
derogatory information revokes any standing waiver and results in immediate denial of
access to IT systems.” (GE 6 at 3)
Information  Management,
As  a  result,  Applicant’s  access  to  the  government  customer’s  information
technology (IT) system was suspended that day, pending the results of an Army inquiry.
(GE 8 at 3) As a result, Applicant could not perform his duties for contractor M, so he
was terminated, on May 12, 2017. (GE 8 at 6, Tr. 49-52) (SOR ¶¶ 3.a, 4.b)
The  termination  memo  to  Applicant from  his employer began, “This  letter serves
as  your  official  notice   that  you   have   been   removed   from   contract  due   to   unintentional
classified   spillage.”  (GE  8   at  4)   (Emphasis  added)  This  conclusion   comports  with
Applicant’s testimony  that his actions were unintentional and  not  deliberate. (Tr. 50-51,
103-104) He  continues  to  believe  that  the  information  at  issue  in  the  incident  was not in
fact classified; and  he  attested  that others working  in the  lab  told  him  this as well. (Tr.
106-107)  However,  Applicant   stated   at  the   hearing   that   he   acknowledged   to   his
employer at the time that he was culpable  for the incident. (Tr. 105-106)
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  verbally  informed  of  the  government  customer’s
concerns about the spillage incident, but was not given an opportunity to respond, either
verbally or in writing. (Tr. 103-104) He said he  “strongly disagreed  with  the  decision  to
terminate  him,  and  he  said  he  “did  not  spill  or  aggregate  classified  information.”  He
believes  that  the  government  supervisor  should  have  “retracted”  (i.e.,  redacted)  or
encrypted  the  information.  (Tr.  37-39)  He  said  he  was  not  aware  of  the  result  of  any
government investigation into the incident, and he is not aware that his clearance itself
was  ever  suspended.  (Tr.  54-55,  139)  Nor  is  there  documentation  of  any  such
investigation in the record.
Applicant said he had no other employment issues at contractor M before he was
terminated over the spillage incident. (Tr. 107) He said he was told he was eligible for
rehire.  (Tr.  37)  Applicant  also  noted  his  stellar  security  record,  with  no  violations,  and
said this would not happen again. (Tr. 39-40)
The Government did not offer testimony of any expert witness in the security field
regarding whether the spillage  was in fact classified; whether it was due  to  Applicant’s
culpability;  whether  Applicant’s  actions  were  deliberate,  negligent,  or  inadvertent;  and
what  damage  to national security  resulted from the spill,  if  any.  Beyond  the  May 2017
letter from the Army on the matter  (GE 8), the Government offered no evidence of the
conclusions of any investigating authorities. Nor did the Government offer any testimony
about applicability of any of the NISPOM paragraphs cited in the SOR.
Guidelines J & G:
In  August  2007,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  under  the
influence of alcohol. (DUI) (SOR ¶ 1.b) He explained that he was drinking at a pub one
evening and was pulled over on his way home after making a left turn at a red light. He
failed a roadside breathalyzer test. He was cited or ticketed, and allowed to take a cab
home. He said he was not arrested. He went to court in August 2007 and received one
year of probation  including a six-month alcohol awareness group therapy program. He
completed  the  program  early,  in  April  2008.  (Tr.  64-65;  GE  1  at  45,  93-96)  Applicant
was required to abstain from alcohol while on probation, but resumed drinking casually
once his probation ended. (Tr. 94-95)
In  June  2017,  Applicant  was  out  one  night  at  a  nightclub  and  restaurant  with  a
friend. Applicant had about three beers and two shots. While driving the friend home in
the early morning hours, he crossed the center line and was pulled over by police. After
failing  a  roadside  sobriety  test  and  refusing  a  breathalyzer,  he  was  arrested  and
charged with driving while impaired by alcohol (DWI) (SOR ¶ 1.a (Tr. 118-119) He was
later allowed to call a cab. Applicant acknowledged at his hearing that he had had too
much to drink, and that it was “completely my fault.” (Tr. 66) He pleaded guilty and was
sentenced to  two  years of  probation.  He also  spent three  weekends  in  jail.  (Tr. 65-66,
69)
In  July  2017,  Applicant  was  evaluated  and  found  appropriate  for  a  26-week
outpatient substance abuse treatment program. No diagnosis of an alcohol use disorder
was  indicated.  (Tr.  67-68,  72;  AE  B)  The  program  consisted  of  group  sessions.
Applicant was an active and positive participant and was regarded as a model client. He
completed the program successfully in early March 2018. (AE B)
In  November 2017, while  on probation for the  DWI, Applicant was  arrested and
charged  with  a  probation  violation,  after  he  attempted  to  purchase  a  firearm  in  a
neighboring state. (SOR ¶ 2.a) Applicant testified that during this period, when he was
“going  in  and  out  of  jail”  on  weekends,  he  would  make  himself  feel  better  by  “buying
things.” He saw a shotgun that he thought his father would like as a gift. The best deal
for the gun was in a neighboring state, where there was no sales tax, so he went there
to purchase the weapon. (Tr.  73-74) The attempted firearms purchase was disallowed
because of the background check. (Tr. 143-144) Applicant does not own any firearms.
(Tr. 74)
Applicant testified that he was not aware that his actions were prohibited while on
probation, because he did not read the full details of his probation document and other
available information detailing the restrictions. (Tr. 73, 124) His DWI charge came up in
the  background  check  for  the  firearms  purchase.  A  warrant  was  issued,  and  he  was
arrested. Applicant had to perform 10 hours of community service as a result, which he
completed in May 2018. (Tr. 68, 71; AE C, AE D) Applicant acknowledged the probation
violation was his fault. (Tr. 73) He testified that he reported the violation to his employer.
(Tr. 124)
Applicant  testified  that  there  was  no  other  negative  impact  on  his  probation  for
the DWI. He completed  probation  successfully in  August 2019. (GE  6 at 3;  Tr. 69) He
has had no other charges. (Tr. 143)
Applicant said he was required to abstain from drinking while on probation  for two
years, and  did  so. (Tr.  119-120)  He  said  that  since  his second  alcohol offense,  he  has
significantly   curtailed   his  drinking.  He  recalled   having   “a  drink  or  two”  at  home   on
Memorial  Day   and   on   the   July   4th   weekend   (2021),  but  otherwise,  “I  really   don’t  drink
much  at all.” And  he  does not  drink and  drive  “no  matter how  much  I’ve  been  drinking.”
(Tr. 71, 119, 123)  He said he  now  consumes alcohol once  a  week or less (“if  that.”). He
said he  consumes  at most,  three  beers, and  not  to  intoxication. (Tr. 120-122) Applicant
said he  was not currently  in any  alcohol counseling  or therapy  and  does not believe  he
has an alcohol problem. (Tr. 122-123)
Guideline E:
Having  submitted  an  SCA  in  January  2018  (GE  3),  Applicant  had  a  related
background interview on September 13, 2018. (GE 6 at 5-10) Days later, on September
17,  2018  (addendum  signed  September  18,  2018),  Applicant  submitted  a  Declaration
for  Federal  Employment  (GE  4),  for  a  job  application  with  another  government
department.  (Tr.  88-89)  He  then  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  Public  Trust  Positions
(SF-85P).  on  September  27,  2018.  (GE  5) The  record  does  not  contain  a  subsequent
background interview after GE 4 and GE 5.
The Guideline E allegations in the SOR concern Applicant’s allegedly deliberate
failure to disclose some of his arrests and some of his employment terminations on his
January  2018  SCA  and  his  September  2018  SF-85P  application.  Applicant  denied  all
allegations of deliberate falsification in the SOR. (Answer; Tr. 74)
Alleged  Falsifications relating to  Arrests:
SOR ¶ 4.h alleges in part, that in answering a series of questions on his January
2018  SCA  with  a  seven-year  timeframe  (“In  the  past  seven  (7)  years  …”),  Applicant
failed to disclose his first DUI in 2007. (GE 3 at 35) During questioning at his hearing, it
became  clear  that  Applicant  had  no  duty  to  disclose  that  offense  in  answer  to  those
questions, since it occurred in 2007, 11 years prior. (Tr. 75-82)
Applicant  acknowledged,  however,  that  he  also  did  not  list  his  2007  DUI  in
answer to other questions on GE 3, such  as “Other than those offenses already listed,
have you  EVER had the following happen to you? . . . Have  you EVER been charged
with  an  offense  involving  alcohol or drugs?” (GE  1  at 37)  Falsification  of  that  question
was not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant  had   disclosed   his  2007   DUI  on   his  2010   SCA,   and   detailed   the
circumstances of  the  arrest,  his court case, and  alcohol awareness program. (GE 1  at
43-45; Tr. 96-98) He did not list the 2007 DUI on his 2015 SCA, in answer to a question,
“Have  you  EVER been  charged  with  an offense  involving  alcohol or drugs.” (GE 2  at 31-
32) When  asked  why  he  did  not  list the  2007  DUI in answer to  that question,  Applicant
said  he   “must  have   misinterpreted   the   question   and   that  it   was  another  seven-year
question.”   He  asserted   that   he   would   not   have   “intentionally   tried   to   hide   something   I
already  [had] previously  disclosed.” (Tr. 115, 116)  This omission  was not alleged  in the
SOR as a deliberate  falsification.
Applicant  also  explained  that  when  he  was  interviewed  in  2015  about  his
previous SCA, he was told by the interviewing agent that he did not have to discuss his
2007 DUI after that interview. (Tr. 75-78, 117-118) Applicant also volunteered the 2007
DUI  in  his  September  2018  background  interview  (GE  6  at  10)  and  listed  it  on  his
September 2018 SF-85P. (GE 5 at 27)
On  his January  2018  SCA,  Applicant disclosed  his 2017  DUI, but did  not disclose
his November 2017  probation  violation  arrest  for the  attempted  gun  purchase. (GE  3  at
35) This omission is alleged as an  additional deliberate  falsification in SOR ¶ 1.h.
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  should  have  disclosed  his  2017  probation
violation  arrest  on  GE  3.  He  asserted  that  he  told  his  security  chief  and  program
manager about it, but this is uncorroborated. He denied intentionally failing to disclose it
and said he must have overlooked it or misinterpreted the question. (Tr. 82) However,
Applicant  acknowledged  that  in  January  2018,  the  charge  from  the  November  2017
probation violation was pending, and had yet to be adjudicated. (Tr. 144-147) As such,
he  should  have  disclosed  it  in  answer  to  the  question,  “Are  you  currently  on  trial  or
awaiting  a  trial  on  criminal  charges.”  (GE  3  at  35)  That  omission,  however,  was  not
alleged in the SOR as a deliberate falsification. The summary of Applicant’s September
2018  background  interview  reflects  that  he  voluntarily  disclosed  the  arrest  and  the
violation to the interviewer. (GE 6 at 9)
When   he   prepared   his  September  27,  2018   SF-85-P,  Applicant  disclosed   both
the   2007   DUI  arrest  and   the   2017   DWI   arrest,   but,   again,   not  the   subsequent  2017
probation   violation   arrest,  in  answer  to   a   question   about  his  criminal  history   with   a
seven-year timeframe.  (SOR ¶  4.j)  Of this  omission,  Applicant  said, “I  don’t  know  why  I
would intentionally  deny  it. Maybe  because  it  hadn’t gone  to  trial yet,  I’m  not sure.” (Tr.
83)   In   fact,   the   document  regarding   Applicant’s  completion   of   the   10   hours  of  work
release   shows  a   trial  date   of   March  27,  2018,  and   that  he   completed   the   required
community  service a  month  later,  so  the  charge  was no  longer pending  by  September
2018. (AE D)
Asked why he failed to list his 2017 probation violation arrest on either GE 3 or
GE 5, Applicant said, “I don’t know why I wouldn’t have, Your Honor. I discussed it with
both  investigators.  It  must  have  been  an  oversight  on  my  part  and  I’m  sorry.”  (Tr.  90,
130-131)
Alleged Falsifications relating to  Employment  Terminations:
SOR  ¶  4.i  concerns  several  employment-related  falsification  allegations  on
Applicant’s  September  2018  SF-85P.  (GE  5)  In  answer  to  a  question  calling  for
disclosure of all employment terminations in the past seven years, Applicant disclosed
his  2017  termination  from  contractor  M  (SOR  ¶  4.b),  but  he  did  not  disclose  his  other
terminations,  from  contractor  T  in  July  2017;  from  contractor  C  in  April  2014  (SOR  ¶
4.c); or from his federal job in January 2013 (SOR ¶ 4.g).
When asked why he did not disclose these other terminations on GE 5, Applicant
testified that he had filled out a lot of SCAs and  SF-85Ps in the past, and believed he
had  disclosed  them  previously.  He  asserted  that  the  errors  he  made  on  his  various
applications  were honest mistakes, and  were  not an  attempt  to  “obfuscate  any sins or
past indiscretions whatsoever.” (Tr. 91)
On his 2015 SCA, Applicant disclosed his termination from another government
department and provided extensive details. (GE 2 at 13-15) He also disclosed his April
2014  termination  from  contractor  C  and  noted  that  he  had  been  fired  because  the
customer was not satisfied with his work, (GE 2 at 12-13)
On  his  January  2018  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  his  July  2017  termination  from
contractor T, and  noted  that the  customer, a  large  defense  contractor, “didn’t need  my
input  anymore.”  (GE  3  at  14-15;  Tr.  125).  He  disclosed  his  2017  termination  from
contractor M, said that he “left by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of
misconduct,”  noted  the  spillage  incident,  and  said  he  had  been  removed  from  the
contract, but was subject to rehire. (GE 3 at 16; Tr. 125)
On   his  January   2018   SCA,   Applicant  also   noted   other  terminations,  from
contractor  C,   in  April  2014   and   from   the   federal  department   job,  in  July   2013,   but   he
gave  no  details. (GE 3  at 17-18) He also answered  “No” in answering  questions calling
for  disclosure  of   adverse  circumstances   (if   he   was  fired,  quit,   or  left  by   mutual
agreement following  allegations of  misconduct or  unsatisfactory  performance). (GE 3  at
27)  Applicant  explained   that,   he   was  confused   by   the   page   break   in  the   middle  of  the
page   that  he   filled   out,   and   did  not  realize   he   should  have   answered   “yes”  to   the
question,  since   he   knew   he   had   been   fired   by   contractor  C.  (Tr.  126-129)   No
employment-termination-related  falsifications of GE 3  are alleged  in the SOR.
Applicant  discussed  his  various  terminations  during  his  September  13,  2018
background  interview.  (GE  6  ay  6-7).  However,  on  his  September  27,  2018  SF-85P,
submitted  only  two  weeks  later,  Applicant  did  not  disclose  his  terminations  from
contractor  C  and  contractor  T,  both  of  which  had  occurred  during  the  previous  seven
years,  in  answer  to  a  question  calling  for  disclosure  of  those  events.  (GE  5  at  22).
Curiously,  Applicant  disclosed  his  July  2017  termination  from  contractor  M,  which
occurred  within  the  seven-year  timeframe  of  the  question,  but  also  two  other
terminations from many years before, in 2002 and 2005. (GE 5 at 22; Tr. 137) Applicant
again acknowledged that he should have disclosed the terminations from contractors C
and  T,  but  asserted  that  his  omissions  were  unintentional.  (Tr.  137-138)  Applicant
expressed remorse for his errors and apologized for them. (Tr. 147-148, 161-162)
Applicant  also  did  not  list  his  terminations  from  contractors  C,  M,  and  T  on  his
Declaration  for  Federal  Employment,  in  September  2018,  despite  the  presence  of  a
question calling for disclosure of all employment terminations in the last five years. (GE
4 at Question 12). As to this form, Applicant explained that he thought the question he
was only being  asked  to  disclose  terminations from  “a federal job  or a  government job
within the  last  five  years. That’s how  I looked  at the  question.” (Tr.  134-135) Applicant
maintained  his  interpretation  of  the  question  under  additional  questioning  at  hearing.
(Tr. 135-136)
Among the documents Applicant submitted after the hearing was a  DFE that he
submitted in April 2020. (AE G) On that form, he checked “Yes” to a question asking if,
during the  last  seven  years, he  had  been  convicted,  imprisoned,  been  in  prison,  been
on probation or been on parole. The question “includes felonies, firearms or explosives
violations,  misdemeanors,  and  all  other  offenses.”  (AE  G  at  Q.  9)  He  reported  an
offense as follows:
2019   [City   B,  State   X].   2.   Year
Question   9:   Misdemeanor  DUI  5/17/----
probation  completed  August 2019. No further  issues” followed  by  a  phone
number (AE G at 2) (Emphasis added).
The   year of  the   offense   given,  2019,  is   likely  an   error,   as   probation   ended   only
months   later,   in  August  2019,   and   there  was  no   discussion   at  hearing   of   a   May   2019
DUI.   I  conclude   that  he   likely   meant   to   disclose   his  2017   DUI  on   AE   G.  Yet   Applicant
also did not list his November 2017  arrest for  the  probation  violation  on  AE  G, in answer
to   this  question   with   a   seven-year  timeframe,  and   also   said  that   probation   was
completed with “no other issues.”
AE G also contained a question asking, in part,
During the last five years, have you been fired for a job for any reason, did
you  quit  after  being  told  that  you  would  be  fired,  did  you  leave  any  job
because  of  specific  problems,  or  were  you  debarred  from  Federal
employment by the Office of Personnel Management or any other Federal
agency? (AE G at Q. 12)
Applicant  answered   “Yes”  and   disclosed   his  May   2017   termination   from
contractor  M   “per  request  of   the   Government  COR  for  allegedly   mishandling   sensitive
information;  eligible   for  rehire.”  (AE   G  at  2)  He  did  not  disclose   his  termination   from
contractor  T,  in  July   2017.   Since   Applicant   submitted   AE   G  post-hearing,  he   was  not
questioned about any of these  answers.
Since  his termination  following  the  spillage  incident  in  May  2017,  Applicant  has
subsequently participated in extensive annual training required for his position. After the
hearing,  he  provided  extensive  documentation  of  his  remedial  and  other  security
training on numerous subjects related to his professional position. (Tr. 140; AE F, AE H)
Applicant’s  2020   performance   review   reflects  that  he   exceeds   expectations
across  the  board.  He performed   “extraordinary   work”   under difficult  circumstances.   He
is  a   highly   trained   and   capable   security   professional  and   greatly  contributed   to   the
mission’s success. (AE A)
