Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through 1.f. After a thorough
and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is  38  years old.  He  served  in the  military  from  2004  to  2014  and  received
an honorable discharge. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2016. He married in 2007 and
divorced  in 2009.  He remarried  in  2012  and  divorced  in 2014. He  has a  14-year-old child.
He has cohabitated  with  a  woman  since  2017. He has been  employed  by  a  government
contractor since December 2016. (Item 2)
Applicant  has  five  delinquent  credit  card  debts  totaling  approximately  $24,254
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b-$4,137; 1.c-$6,502; 1.d-$2,946; 1.e-$7,333 and 1.f-$3,336). In his August
2019 security clearance application, he disclosed the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d, and 1.f.
He stated that these debts were unresolved and he expected them to be removed from
his credit report at the end of the year. (Item 2)
During Applicant’s September 2019 interview with a government investigator, he
was confronted with the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.f and acknowledged he
owed each debt. He told the investigator he did not intend on paying these debts and was
waiting for them to fall off his credit report. He stated that his financial difficulties arose
when he was discharged from the military (2014) and when his former spouse left him.
He said he had difficulties paying his bills. The debt is SOR ¶ 1.a ($985) is a collection
account for a medical debt that became delinquent in 2016. (Items 3 and 5)
In Applicant’s April 2021 answer to the SOR, he denied each alleged debt and said
the accounts were past the statute of limitations and no longer on his credit report. Credit
reports from September 2019 and January 2020 reflect the delinquent debts.  No other
evidence was provided by Applicant. (Items 1, 4, and 5)
