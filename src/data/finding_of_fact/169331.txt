Applicant  has  been  sponsored  for  employment  as  a  software  engineer  by  a
defense contractor since October 2019 (Item 4). She is a 56-year-old software engineer
who  was not employed from  May 2018 to October 2019, when she experimented with
retirement as she simultaneously helped care for her ailing, elderly mother. She had been
employed  as  a  software  engineer  in  the  private  sector  between  December  1999  and
March 2014, when she was subject to a reduction in force, and between June 2015 and
May 2018, when she decided to try retirement. She has never been married and has no
children. She served in the U.S. military reserve from March 1985 to September 1990,
when she was honorably discharged. She has not previously held an industrial clearance,
but had a previous background investigation during her time in the military.
The  SOR  alleges,  Items  3-7  substantiate, and  Applicant admits, four  delinquent
debts totaling over $20,000 (SOR 1.a-1.c and 1.h). The Government withdrew SOR debts
1.d-1.g  (FORM).  The  debts  comprise  $20,000  in  delinquent  medical  bills  and  a  $500
commercial credit account. The medical bills appear to have originated with an unalleged
$28,000 judgment obtained in December 2016 (Item 7).
Applicant  reported  several  financial  issues  on  her  October  2019  clearance
application (Item 3), including the debts encompassed at SOR 1.a-1.c, two medical bills
later  withdrawn  by  the  Government  (SOR  1.d  and  1.g),  and  1.h.  She  discussed  these
debts, among others, during an interview with a Government investigator in December
2019  (Item  4)  based  on  her  November  2019  credit  report  (Item  5).  Among  the  other
delinquent  accounts  reflected  on  the  November  2019  credit  report  were  several
educational loans that were later brought current and therefore not alleged in the  SOR.
She claimed, without corroboration, to have been making $20 monthly payments on SOR
debt 1.h. She also claimed to have been making $500 monthly payments on the medical
judgment  until  about  May  2018,  when  she  stopped  working  and  began  caring  for  her
mother. She  claimed,  without  corroboration, to  have  been  making efforts to  locate  the
creditor holding the judgment, without success.
Applicant attributed  her medical debts to  her March 2014  layoff. Initially  provided
with  extended  medical coverage, she  did  not realize  the  steps she  had  to  take  to  continue
the  coverage, undertook additional medical treatment for a  condition  that her insurance
had  previously  covered, only  to  discover that  her coverage  has  expired  and  the  treatment
was not covered. Changes of  address, miscommunications, and  other problems kept her
from  learning  that the  debts had  been  reduced  to  judgment in  December 2016. She  began
making  payments  with  her then-current employer, but those  payments stopped  when  she
left that  job  in  May  2018. Her a  dditional unemployment  caused  the balance  to  grow, and
at the  time  of  her clearance  application,  credit  report, and  subject  interview, the  combined
balances were just  over $20,000. Applicant continued  to  have  problems getting  a  current
debt  figure.  She  ultimately  provided  a  17  May  2021  letter from  the  creditor confirming  a
$10,000  payment  that  day, and  a  remaining  balance  of $10,202.80  (Response). Applicant
claims  in  her  Response   that  she   agreed   with   the   creditor  to   set  up   automatic  monthly
payments   (six   at  a   time,   which  is  what  her  employer  allows)  of  $350.  However,  the
creditorâ€™s letter does not confirm  this plan, and  Applicant has provided  no  corroboration
of her past efforts to contact the creditor or to  set up a  payment plan.
Her two unemployment periods adversely affected her finances beyond the SOR
allegations, but Applicant provided documentation of her efforts to resolve those debts
and they are not alleged in the SOR.  However, she has not documented any credit or
financial  counseling.  She  did  not  provide  a  budget  showing  her  ability  to  manage  her
claimed  repayment  plan.  She  did  not  present  any evidence from coworkers,  character
references, or community groups.
