Applicant  is  a  45-year-old  civilian  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  who  seeks
continuation  of  her  security  clearance.  The  admitted  allegations  are  incorporated  and
adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant married in August 2001. She has two children and one step-child from
this marriage. (GE 3) She earned an associate’s degree in March 2011 and a bachelor’s
degree in August 2012 from the same university. (GE 3) Applicant reported no military
service.
Since  June  2016,  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  her  current  contractor  as  a
senior acquisition associate. (GE 3) Between January 2008 and May 2015, she worked
for  other  defense  contractors  in  various  positions.  She  has  held  a  security  clearance
since approximately October 1998. (Item 3)
Applicant’s  finances
Between   August  2010   and   January   2012,  Applicant   took  out  six   student  loans
with   the   lender   holding   student  loan   accounts  covered   by   SOR  ¶¶   1.a-1.f.   (Items   4-5)
These   student  loans   are  comprised   of   SOR  ¶¶   1.a   ($10,860);  1.b   ($12,126);  1.c
($6,104);  1.d   ($11,556);  1.e   ($6,949);  and   1.f   ($7,458).   Credit  reports  document  that
Applicant’s student   loans have  been   delinquent   intermittently   between   2018   and   2020,
and were assigned to the U.S. Department of  Education (DoE)
Following  the  assignment  of  Applicant’s  loans  to  the  DoE,  the  accounts  were
consolidated  and  brought  current  in  October  2020.  (GEs  4-5)  Since  October  2020,
Applicant’s  consolidated   student  loans  have   been   in  forbearance   with   reported   zero
balances.  (Items  2   and   6-7)  Each   of   her  deferred   student  loans   is  scheduled   to   be
returned  to  regular  payment status  in  January  2022.  (Item  7) In  anticipation  of her loans
being   returned   to   regular  payment  status,  Applicant  initiated   making   regular  monthly
payments  between  November 2020  and  May  2021, and  is credited  with  total payments
for this period  of  $4,800. (Item  7)
Besides   her  student   loans,  Applicant   incurred   two   other   delinquent   debts
between   August  2017   and   December  2019.  One   of  the   debts  involved   a   default
judgment entered  against  herself and  her husband  in  March 2020  (covered  by  SOR ¶,
1.g). This entered   judgment  reportedly   arose   from   her husband’s car accident  and   his
failure to  resolve  the  financing  charges still  owing  on  the  vehicle  in reported  amount of
$10,638.  (Item   6)  Applicant  documented   her  removal  as  a   responsible   party   on   the
entered  judgment.  (Item  8)  She  provided  no  additional information  covering  her SOR  ¶
1.h  delinquent  $864  debt  on  a  credit card account opened  in 2014. It  is a  reported  old
credit card debt for claimed  attorneys fees that Applicant apparently  disputes. While  the
debt quite  possibly  has been  charged  off  by  the  creditor, it remains  listed  in Applicant’s
credit report as a delinquent debt.
