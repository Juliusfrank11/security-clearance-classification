Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since June 2019. He attended college for a period, but he has not
earned a degree. He married in 2002 and divorced in 2005. He has cohabitated with his
girlfriend since 2016. He has four children between the ages of 10 and 18. (Transcript

Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  problems,  including  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy
discharge  in  2010.  The  SOR  alleges  the  bankruptcy;  ten  delinquent  medical  debts
totaling about $3,244; three child support accounts that are in arrears for about $29,700;
a  charged-off  auto  loan  for  $16,862;  and  two  miscellaneous  delinquent  debts  totaling
$1,600. Applicant admitted owing all of the non-medical debts, and he denied owing the
medical  debts.  He  asserted  that  he  paid  some  of  the  medical  debts,  and  he  had
payment arrangements for the rest of the medical debts. (Tr. at 26; Applicant’s response
to SOR)
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  his  2005  divorce  and  the  loss  of
income after he quit a job in July 2016 that he had held since 2009. The company was
bought by another company, and he did not agree with the  ethics and practices of the
new management. The  medical debts are  copayments for his children  that  his ex-wife
failed to bring to his attention. (Tr. at 23-24, 27-28, 35-38; Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s  four  children  are  with  three  mothers,  which  is  why  there  are  three
child support accounts. The SOR alleged the past-due amount of the accounts, not the
balances. The past-due amounts and the balances increased from the July 2019 credit
report  to  the  June  2020  credit  report,  but  they  decreased  from  the  June  2020  credit
report to the March 2021 credit report, which indicates that Applicant is paying his child
support  and  arrearages.  His  child  support  payments  and  arrearages  are  being
garnished  from  his  pay  checks.  He  is  paying  $717,  $705,  and  $513  per  month,  for  a
total  of  $1,935  in  monthly  child  support  payments.  The  March  2021  credit  report  lists
one  account  as  no  longer  past  due.  Applicant’s  oldest  child  is  18  years  old  and  not
attending  college.  His  child  support  payments  for  that  child  continue  to  be  paid  at  the
same  rate,  except  they  will  be  used  to  pay  the  arrearages,  which  will  be  paid  quicker
since the whole payment is going to the arrearages. His two middle children turn 18 in
2023. (Tr. at 24-25, 35-37; Applicant’s response to SOR: GE 1-5)
The creditor for the $16,862 charged-off auto loan (SOR ¶ 1.a) offered to accept
$5,850  in  settlement  of  the  debt.  Applicant  could  not  afford  to  make  a  lump-sum
payment,  so  he  arranged  for  monthly  payments  of  $250  to  be  automatically  debited
from  his  credit  union  account.  He  paid  $100  in  December  2020,  then  started  monthly
payments of $250. He documented that he made nine $250 payments between January
and September 2021, which in addition to the $100 payment, total $2,350. (Tr. at 28-30;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3-5; AE C, D, H, I)
Applicant had payment arrangements for the $810 delinquent loan (SOR ¶ 1.c).
He  documented  eight  $90  payments  between  December  2020  and  May  2021.  (AE  E)
Those eight payments total about $720, which is one payment short of $810. (Tr. at 33;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3-5: AE E, H, I)
Applicant  agreed  to  pay  $65.82  every  two  weeks,  starting  in  January  2021,  for
the  $790  delinquent  loan  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  He  documented  twelve  $65.82  payments
between  January  2020  and  April  2021,  which  paid  the  debt  in  full.  (Tr.  at  33-34;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3-5; AE B, H, I)
The  SOR  alleges  ten  medical  debts  totaling  about  $3,244,  as  listed  on  a  July
2019  credit  report,  a  June  2020  credit  report,  or  both  credit  reports.  None  of  the
accounts  are  identified  in  the  SOR  by  name  or  account  number.  Four  medical  debts
totaling about $1,385 (SOR ¶¶ 1.n-1.q) are listed on the July 2019 credit report, but they
are  not  listed  on  the  two  more  recent  credit  reports.  Two  medical  debts  for  $924  and
$21 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.i) are  listed on the June 2020 credit report,  but not the March
2021 credit report. Four medical debts totaling about $1,385 (SOR ¶¶ 1.e-1.h) are listed
on every credit report. (GE 3-5)
Applicant  stated  that  he  contacted  the  collection  company  for  the  debts  in
December 2020. He asserted that he paid one debt and made payment arrangements
for  the  other  debts.  He  provided  documentation  of  a  $30  payment  in  December  2020
and an agreement with the collection company to pay $50 per month by credit card from
January to April 2020. (Tr. at 32, 34, 38; AE A, F)
Applicant  asserted  that  his  finances  are  currently  not  perfect,  but  he  and  his
girlfriend  are  paying  their  debts.  She  has  a  job  and  contributes  to  the  household’s
finances. He is working a second job to help him pay his child support. (Tr. at 23, 39-40;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Two  witness  testified on  Applicant’s  behalf. His  supervisor described  him  as  an
exemplary  worker  and  an  outstanding  person.  The  witnesses  praised  Applicant’s
judgment,  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  dependability.  Applicant  was  arrested  for
alcohol-related driving offenses in 2012 and 2015, and he was arrested for non-alcohol-
related driving offenses in 2017.1 (Tr. at 18-22; GE 1, 2)
