student  loans  to  his  2013  period  of  self-employment.  In  his  Answer  and  FORM
Response,  he  stated  that  his  student  loans  remained  delinquent  because  he  was
financially  supporting  his  sister-in-law,  who  was  disabled  and  not  yet  approved  for
disability  benefits,  in  addition  to  his  best  friend,  who  had  difficulty  finding  employment

disabled and required assistance with daily activities, which Applicant, at times, had to
pay  for;  his  home  required  repair  after  it  was  damaged  by  a  tornado  in  2019,  and  he
was  in  the  process  of  appealing  his  denied  insurance  claim;  and  he  and  his  spouse
spent their savings after Applicant’s security  clearance  was suspended  and  he  lost  his
job. (Items 2, 7; Form Response)

secured new employment and built up his savings. He stated that he stopped providing

loans  and  planned  to  increase  his  monthly  payments.  He  stated  that  he  moved  his
sister-in-law, who had secured Medicare coverage and applied for disability benefits, to
live with him and his spouse to consolidate living expenses. He submitted no evidence
to  show  he  received  financial  counseling,  is  following  a  budget,  or  engaged  any  debt
consolidation services. (Items 2, 7; FORM Response)
