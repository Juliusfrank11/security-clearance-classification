Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since January 2019. He is applying for a security clearance for the
first  time.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree,  which  he  earned  in  1996,  and  he  attended  a
school that helped him pass an examination to be licensed as a real estate agent. He is
married  for  the  second  time  after  his  first  marriage  ended  in  divorce.  He  has  two
children and four stepchildren. (Transcript (Tr.) at 10, 22-23; GE 1, 2)
Applicant started smoking marijuana in 1992 when he was a freshman in college.
He  continued  to  sporadically  use  marijuana  through  November  2018.  He  used
hallucinogenic mushrooms on one occasion in 2017, but he did not like the experience
and never used them again. (Tr. at 10, 14-15; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant lives in a state that has not legalized marijuana. In 2016, he invested in
a  registered  marijuana farm  in a  state  that has  made marijuana  legal under state  law.
He owned about 12% of the farm. He had no involvement in the operation of the farm.
He sold his share of the farm for $75,000 in December 2020. (Tr. at 16-17; Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A)
Applicant  reported  his  use  of  marijuana  and  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  and  his
investment  in  the  marijuana  farm  on  the  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions
(SF-86)  he  submitted  in  July  2019.  He  reported  that  he  used  marijuana  about  once  a
year,  with  his  last  use  in  November  2018.  He  checked  the  box  indicating  that  he
intended to use marijuana in the future, with the explanation: “THC combined with CBD
have  proven  therapeutic  effects  on  the  human  body,  and  THC  is  legal  in  two-thirds
(33/50) of US states plus our nation’s capital. I do not smoke or consume THC in public
places and do not operate a motor vehicle while under the influence.” (GE 1)
Applicant  discussed  his  drug  use  during  his background  interview  in  July 2019.
He  stated  that  he  did  not  intend  to  use  illegal  drugs  in  the  future.  He  repeated  that
position  in  his  response  to  interrogatories  in  November  2020,  in  his  March  2021
response to the SOR, and at his hearing. (GE 2)
Applicant has not used any illegal drugs since November 2018, before he started
work for a defense contractor and before he submitted his SF-86. He understands that
marijuana possession is against federal law, and illegal drug use and investments in the
marijuana  industry  are  inconsistent  with  holding  a  security  clearance.  He  credibly
testified that he does not intend to use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future.
He  provided  a  signed  statement  of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  drug  involvement  and
substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for
revocation  of  national  security  eligibility  (Tr.  at  10-11,  15-20;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 1, 2; AE B)
