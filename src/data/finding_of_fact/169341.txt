Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for
her  current  employer  or  a  predecessor  contractor  since  2016.  She  seeks  to  retain  a
security clearance, which  she has held since about 2017. She is attending college but
has not yet earned a degree. She married in 2010 and divorced in 2017. She has two
children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 18-19, 28, 37-39; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  admitted  that  she  and  her  ex-husband  were  reckless  with  their
spending when they were younger. They took out a consolidation loan to pay their credit
cards,  and  then  had  a  difficult  time  maintaining  the  payments.  They  engaged  the
services  of  a  debt-resolution  company  in  2016.  They  paid  $1,000  per  month  into  the
company’s debt-relief program (DRP) for a period, but Applicant was unable to continue
the payments after her divorce, and she had to withdraw from the program. (Tr. at 18-
19, 26; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3)
Neither  Applicant  nor  her  ex-husband  used  an  attorney  in  their  divorce,  and
Applicant accepted less in the division of assets and liabilities than she might otherwise
have  received,  because  she  just  wanted  the  marriage  to  end.  She  received  all  of  the
marital  debt,  including  the  debts  in  the  SOR,  except  for  one  credit  card  debt.  They
maintain joint custody of their children, and neither party has to pay child support. He is
supposed  to  pay  half  of  the  children’s  healthcare  costs,  but  he  rarely  does.  She
maintains  the  health  insurance  for  the  children.  (Tr.  at  19-21,  28-30;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s  finances  stabilized  for  a  period  after  her  divorce.  She  and  a  partner
shared  a  home  and  expenses,  and  she  was  able  to  start  paying  her  debts  again.  He
moved out in 2019, and left her with a home she could not afford. She eventually was
able to move into a cheaper home and resumed paying her debts. (Tr. at 19)
The SOR alleges  13 delinquent debts. However, the $357 debts in SOR  ¶¶ 1.h
and  1.j  are  duplicate  accounts.  The  12  non-duplicate  debts  include  a  $47,242
consolidation loan; 4 medical debts totaling $2,454; and 7 miscellaneous debts totaling
$36,925. Applicant admitted owing all of the debts at one time, but she stated that she
paid several debts and was in the process of paying others.
Applicant  settled  and  paid  the  $695  and  $357  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.f  and
1.h in August 2021. (AE D, F) She paid the four medical debts totaling $2,454 (SOR ¶¶
1.g,  1.i,  1.l,  and  1.m)  between  July  2021  and  December  2021.  (Tr.  at  24-25,  32-33;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5-7; AE D-H)
Applicant  considered  filing  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  protection,  but  she  was
advised  that  her  disposable  income  was  too  great  for  a  bankruptcy  discharge.  She
reengaged  the  services  of  the  debt-resolution  company  in  December  2021.  She
enrolled  four  debts  totaling  $25,537  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b-1.e)  in  the  company’s  DRP.  She
agreed to pay the debt-resolution company $293 per month. The company will negotiate
settlements with her creditors, and pay the settlement amounts out of the accumulated
funds,  minus  their  fees.  The  $10,336  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.k  is  not  included  in  the  DRP
because  it  is  reported  as  charged  off  and  transferred  with  a  $0  balance  on  the  most
recent credit report. It is unclear who if anyone is currently collecting the debt. Applicant
stated that the debt will be added to the DRP if a creditor is located. (Tr. at 21-26, 31-
35; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5-7; AE C)
Applicant  contacted  the  creditor  for  the  $47,242  defaulted  consolidation  loan
(SOR ¶ 1.a). She agreed to pay $80 per month. She realizes that it will take a long time
to pay the debt at that rate. She plans to add the debt to the DRP after other debts are
paid. (TR. at 23-24, 30-31; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5-7; AE B)
Applicant  receives  financial  counseling  from  the  debt-resolution  company.  She
realizes that her financial situation is not ideal, but it is improving. She is committed to
paying  her  debts.  She  is  responsible  for  two  children,  and  she  knows  that  financial
security is a necessary part of providing for them. Her ex-husband finally agreed to help
with the children’s medical bills after she threatened to take him to court.  (Tr. at 26, 29,
35-40; AE C)
Applicant submitted letters attesting to her excellent job performance and strong
moral character. She is praised for her dedication, honesty, trustworthiness, work ethic,
reliability, and integrity. (AE I)
