Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owes $125,742 for eight past-
due or delinquent debts (SOR 1.a – 1.h). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all
of  the  Guideline  F  allegations.  (FORM,  Item  2)  In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by
Applicant’s admissions, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 44 years old and is sponsored for a security clearance by a federal
contractor.  In  her  January  2021  e-QIP,  she  disclosed  that  she  owed  approximately
$24,000 for four delinquent or past-due debts.  A credit  report obtained by government
investigators  in  March  2021  documented  these  and  other  delinquencies  about  which
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator on March 19, 2021. During the
interview, Applicant attributed her financial problems to a combination of  living beyond
her means and an unexpected loss of hours at a previous job that reduced her income.
(FORM, Items 4 – 6)
During her March 2021 interview, Applicant advised that she did not think she was
responsible for several of the debts listed in her credit report, and that she does not intend
to pay them. She also stated that she is disputing responsibility for her student-loan debts
(alleged at SOR 1.a and 1.b) because the school she attended was engaged in fraudulent
activities.  Specifically,  she  claimed  that  she  was  told  she  would  receive  a  bachelor’s
degree from the school, but only received an associate’s degree. In her e-QIP, Applicant
listed  that  she  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  from  that  school  in  May  2013.  The  last
payment she made on her student loans was in 2008. (FORM, Items 4 – 6)
Applicant did not provide any information in response to the SOR or the FORM
that would document her claimed dispute about her student loan obligations. She also did
not produce any information about her current finances or efforts to resolve her debts.
