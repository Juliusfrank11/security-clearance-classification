In Applicant’s SOR response, he denied the SOR allegations. (HE 3) He did not
explain why he denied the SOR allegations.
Applicant  is  a  33-year-old  project  engineer,  who  has  worked  for  a  defense
contractor since January 2019. (Tr. 20, 25, 80; GE 1) In 2008, he graduated from high
school. (Tr. 22) In high school, he was in honors academics and participated in track and
cross  country.  (Tr.  22)  He  graduated  from  a  university  with  a  bachelor’s  degree  in
mechanical engineering and a minor in mathematics. (Tr. 23, 81) In 2016, he received a
master’s  degree  in  mechanical  engineering  with  a  concentration  in  design  and
manufacturing. (Tr. 23) In 2020, he received a master’s degree in business administration
(MBA). (Tr. 23) In June 2016, he married, and he does not have any children. (Tr. 23, 81)
He has never served in the military. (Tr. 81) He has held a security clearance since 2010.
(Tr. 24, 82) There is no evidence of any security violations.
Sexual Behavior and Personal Conduct
The  history  of  Applicant’s  sexual  development  is  detailed  in  his  polygraph
interview. (AE L) Prior to September 2016, there is no evidence of illegal sexual conduct
with minors. (Id.) His polygraph result was no deception indicated for questions pertaining
to  sexual  abuse  of  minors  and  viewing  child  pornography,  aside  from  the  offense  in
September 2016. (Id.)
In 2016, a large defense contractor employed Applicant. In June 2016, Applicant
and  his  spouse  moved  to  the  East  Coast.  (Tr.  28-30)  Shortly  after  he  married,  his
employer moved him to the West Coast for three months, and he was unable to visit his
spouse, who  remained  on  the  East Coast,  except for a  brief  visit in July  2016. (Tr. 29-31,
83) Applicant was unable to  make  friends near his work location on the  West Coast, and
he  became  lonely  and  depressed. (Tr. 32-33,  75, 84) He tried  to  meet others; however,
his overtures were  repeatedly rejected. (Tr. 35)
In  September 2016,  Applicant had  been  married  for three  months. (Tr. 78) He said
he  wanted  to  meet someone  he  could  socialize  with, but  not to  date. (Tr. 87) He  went to
several websites on  the  Internet. (Tr. 87-88) He  clicked  a  category  on  the  Internet called
“Wet and  Lonely” or words to  that  effect.  (Tr.  86, 88) An  advertisement suggested  that a
female wanted  to  meet someone  to  watch  Netflix  with  her; however, the  advertisement
included  the  “context of  wanting  to  be  taken  care of  sexually.” (Tr. 89) He responded  to
the  advertisement  indicating  “I’ll  be  glad  to  take  care of  you  or something  like  that.” (Tr.
89)  He communicated  with  V  on  the  Internet,  who  seemed  lonely  and  abandoned. (Tr.
36,  45)  He   said   his  intent  was  for  a   platonic   relationship,   and   he   pursued   the   contact
because  he  was lonely  and  bored. (Tr. 89)  He repeatedly  denied  that  he  intended  to  have
sex  with  V. (Tr. 1  23-125) He acknowledged  that a fair  interpretation  of  his response  to  V
was that he offered to  satisfy  her sexually. (Tr. 90)
V  said her mother was going  to  be  out of town, and  she  wanted  him  to  stay  over
at  her  residence.  (Tr.  39,  115)  V   said   she   was  almost  16   years  old.   (Tr.  38,  90)  He
convinced  himself  that  V  was joking  about her  age  being  only  15.  (Tr. 90) She  asked  for
marijuana;  however, Applicant  “shrugged  it off.”  (Tr.  115) Applicant said he  was not aware
at the  time  he  communicated  with  V  that his  conduct was criminal or “legally  bad.” (Tr.
91) He “shrugged  off” the  possibility  that  V  was a  minor, and  did  not think  about how  he
might be  hurting  a  minor. (Tr. 92) He denied  that he  intended  to  have  sex with  V. (Tr. 92)
He said that he  might not even  meet with  her. (Tr. 115) He said he  just wanted  to  go  for
a  drive. (Tr. 116)  He told the  detectives who  interviewed  him  after his arrest that  a  fair
interpretation  of  V  would  be  that he  wanted  to  have  sex  with  her; however, he  claimed  he
planned  to  sit in his car and  think about it, and  then  “he  would have  changed  his mind
and left but ‘didn’t get the chance’” to leave without having sex  with V. (AE O at 24)
I requested that Applicant provide the police report or court records pertaining to
the allegation in light of his statements about his lack of intent to engage in sexual activity
with  V.  After  the  hearing,  he  provided  the  police  report.  The  police  report  said  that
Applicant wrote in emails or texts several comments to V of a sexual nature, for example,
he said that he “wanted V’s wet p____y tightly around [his] throbbing c__;” and he “wanted
to eat her p____y to make her wet for him;” and in response to her comment about being
15, he said that he liked “younger girls.” (AE O at 9, 12, 21, 30, 52, 54-55) He responded
to V stating she was 15, that her age was not a problem for him. (AE O at 9, 12, 21, 30,
52)
V was actually a law enforcement officer who was acting as a 15-year-old girl. She
suggested that Applicant engage in oral sex with her. (Tr. 114) Applicant agreed to meet
V for sex prior to driving to her apartment. He had been drinking four to six beers over
about five hours, and he considered himself to be “definitely buzzed,” and he had been
taking  his  medication  for  ADHD.  (Tr.  94-97)  However,  he  said  he  did  not  drive  while
intoxicated or impaired when he went to see V. (Tr. 97-98)
Applicant drove  about 30  minutes to  the location where he was supposed to meet
V.  (Tr.  98)  He   had   a   condom   in  his  wallet  before   he   got   into   the   car, and   he   took   the
condom  out of  his wallet.  (Tr. 117) He did not  bring  any  condoms, alcohol, or marijuana
for his meeting  with  V. (Tr. 116-117)  He parked  in a  parking  lot  near V’s building,  and  the
police  arrested  him  for Communication  with  a Minor for Immoral Purposes via Electronic
Communications,  a   felony.  (Tr.  40,  98)  His  father-in-law   provided   his  bail.  (Tr.  47)  He
informed  his boss of  his arrest the  morning  after he  was released  from  jail. (Tr. 47) As a
condition  of  release  pending  disposition  of  the  charge, Applicant agreed  not to  use  the
Internet,  and his employer placed him on a leave of absence. (Tr. 27)
In   October  2018,   Applicant  pleaded   guilty   to   Communication   with   a   Minor   for
Immoral  Purposes  via Electronic  Communications,  and  he  was sentenced  to  30  days in
jail, a  year of probation,  an  $800  fine  and  court  costs,  and  to  register as a  sexual offender.
(Tr. 53-55) Applicant denied  that his purpose  was to  engage  in sexual activity  with  V. (Tr.
41)  He was unclear about the “immoral purpose” involved in his offense.
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleged  that  Applicant  violated  the  rules  for  sex-offender  registration
when he resided within 1,000 feet of a school. Violation of this rule is a Class D felony.
See state M Rev. Stat. § 566.1407.
In  2017, Applicant and  his spouse  purchased  a  house  (H). (Tr. 56,  101-102) When
he  attempted  to  register as a  sex  offender  in 2018, his registration  was rejected  because
the  address he  provided  for H was within 1,000  feet of  a  school. (Tr. 57) He  attempted  to
lease   several  apartments;  however,  the   state’s  computer  rejected   his  applications   to
register as a  sex  offender because  of  their  proximity  to  schools. (Tr. 57) Eventually, he
found  an  apartment he  could  lease  that  met the  school-distance  criteria, and  he  was able
to  complete  his registration  as a  sex  offender. (Tr. 58-59, 100)  His spouse  lives at H, and
Applicant spends about half  of his time  at H. (Tr. 69, 103) He keeps his valuable items at
H. (Tr. 103) He uses the  mailing  address of H. (Tr.  69-70) He keeps his clothing  at his
apartment  and   at  H.  (Tr.  103)  He  considered   the   apartments  he   leased   to   be   his
residences. (Tr. 70-72) He is  aware that  the  legal standard  for  residence  for sex-offender
registration  in his state  is the  location  where he  sleeps. (Tr. 104)  He slept in H on  the
following  occasions: when  his spouse had  a medical emergency; when  the heat was not
working  in his apartment;  and  on  a  couple  of other occasions with  the  permission  of his
probation   officer.  (Tr.   104-107)  He  contacts  his  former  probation   officer  if   he   has
questions  about  what  he   is  permitted   to   do   under  the   state’s  sex-offender  registration
restrictions. (Tr. 105-106)
In   2017,  Applicant  attended   church-sponsored   therapy   and   counseling.  (Tr.  62,
110)  During   his  post-trial  probation,   Applicant  attended   weekly   sex-offender  treatment
sessions   (Tr.   60-62;   AE   E   and   AE   F)   In   April  2019,   he   successfully   completed   his
probation  and  paid  all  fines and  court costs.  (Tr. 66-67; AE  G;  AE  H) After  completion  of
one   year  of  probation,   he   continued   to   attend   therapy   and   counseling   sessions   even
though  he  was  not legally  required  to  continue  with  therapy  and  counseling. (Tr. 65-66;
AE   E)  His  counselor  said,   he   “is  currently   at  no/low   risk  to   reoffend.  It   is  this  writer’s
opinion  that  [Applicant]  is making  the  necessary  changes to  live  a  good  and  productive
life.”  (AE  E) On  January  18, 2021,  his  counselor wrote  that he   “successfully  completed
the treatment requirement of his psychotherapy.” (AE F) Applicant’s family, including his
spouse and in-laws, have  been  very supportive  of Applicant’s rehabilitation. (Tr. 59-60,
67-68, 77) His spouse was approved to be his supervisor when he is around minors, for
example, when he attended a major league baseball game. (Tr. 68-69)
Applicant disclosed his conviction and why he left his previous employment to his
current  employer  and  his  facility  security  officer.  (Tr.  73-74)  Aside  from  the  offense  in
September 2016, Applicant has not communicated with any minors about sex. (Tr. 50)
He did not engage in sexual behavior with minors after September 2016 because it would
upset his wife; he lacks sexual interest in minors; and it is unlawful. (Tr. 50-51) He has
never viewed any child pornography. (Tr. 52) In January 2021, he was diagnosed with,
and he has been receiving treatment for, depression and anxiety. (Tr. 84-85) He regrets
his bad decision that resulted in his conviction. (Tr. 44) His marriage is important to him.
(Tr.  44)  He  has  learned  to  communicate  better  with  his  spouse.  (Tr.  50,  76)  He  has
learned coping mechanisms to address his feelings when he is lonely. (Tr. 75) He is more
religious now. (Tr. 44)

wants to contribute to his country through his employment. (Tr. 126-127) He participated
in several volunteer activities in his community. (AE D) He held multiple leadership roles
related to his employment and national defense. (Id.) He received excellent performance
