In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.q
and 1.s. She admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.r. Her admission is incorporated in my
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  56-year-old  over-the-road  truck  driver  employed  by  a  defense
contractor  since  November  2019.  She  is  a  high  school  graduate.  She  married  in
December 1985 and divorced in July 1994. She has cohabited with her fiancé since March
2015. She has three adult children.
Applicant worked for a major telecommunications company from May 1999 to July
2011, when she was laid off. She worked part time for about two months and then was
unemployed  after marrying  and  moving  to  a  new location.  She  worked  in  several  low-
paying jobs from May 2012 to November 2014. She completed a truck driving course in
January  2015,  received  a  commercial  driver’s  license  (CDL),  and  has  worked
continuously as an over-the-road truck driver from January 2015 to the present.
When Applicant submitted her SCA, she disclosed that she failed to timely file her
federal income tax return for 2013 and pay the taxes due. She stated that her past-due
returns had been filed and she was on a payment plan for her federal tax debt.
When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in February 2020, she
acknowledged  that she  had filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in  July 2013,  which
was dismissed in July 2015. She stated that all her debts were discharged. (GX 7 at 5.)
The credit report from December 2019 reflects that she filed a Chapter13 bankruptcy in
July 2013, and it was paid and dismissed in July 2015. (GX 6 at 6.)
In the February 2020 interview, Applicant also disclosed that she did not pay her
federal income taxes for 2012 and 2013 because of her low pay, and that she was paying
$250 per month on her tax debt. In her response to the FORM, she submitted evidence
that she had been making regular payments to the IRS since March 2019 and that her
balance on the IRS debt is zero. (AX B.)
The 17 delinquent student loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.q all became delinquent
in  December  2015.  She  entered  a  rehabilitation  program  in  February  2020,  requiring
monthly payments of $332 for nine months. (GX 7 at 11.) The delinquent loans are all
reflected in the credit report from May 2021 as special direct consolidation loans, except
for the loans in SOR ¶¶ 1.p and 1.q, which are described as federal loan purchases in the
amounts of $2,531 and $20,018. The total indebtedness is $89,692, which includes the
two federal loan purchases.
Applicant’s FORM response reflects two consolidation loans, one with a balance
of $59,468 and the other with a balance of $7,182 as of October 11, 2021, and they were
both in forbearance until January 31, 2022. Her FORM response also includes Stafford
loans totaling $22,400, in forbearance until January 31, 2022.  The total balance of the
three loans is $89,050, indicating that all of the loans alleged in the SOR, totaling $89,692,
have  been  consolidated  and  are  in  forbearance.  The  forbearance  has  recently  been
extended through May 1, 2022. (https://studentaid.gov.)
The estimated monthly payments for the three consolidation loans are $199, $75,
and $25. Although Applicant did not provide any information about her current  income
and expenses, the estimated monthly payments appear to be affordable now that she is
employed.
