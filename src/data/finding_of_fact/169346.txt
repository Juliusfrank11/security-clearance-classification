Applicant, age 37, is a single mother of three children, ages 15, 16, and 18. She
has  never  been  married.  She  attended  community  college  from  May  through  August
2019. She has been employed as a custodian by a defense contractor since March 2020.
This is her first application for a security clearance. (Item 3)
The  SOR  alleged  30  delinquent  debts  totaling  $51,008,  including  25  medical
accounts  totaling  $35,570;  one  $11,606  federal  social  security  administration  (SSA)
account;  and  four  consumer  accounts  totaling  $3,832.  In  her  SOR  answer,  Applicant
admitted each alleged debt.  (Items 1, 2)
Applicant attributed the medical debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.t, 1.y, and
1.aa through 1.dd to expenses she incurred to treat a medical condition when she did not
have  health  insurance.  She  did  not  have  health  insurance  during  periods  when  she
worked for employers who did not offer health insurance. During her June 2020 security
clearance interview, she expressed an intent to resolve her medical debts via a payment
plan with the help of a state Medicaid program she found. She anticipated that all of her
medical debt would be resolved within two years. In her SOR answer, she asserted that
she set up a payment plan to resolve the issue. She did not offer documentary proof of
that plan or any payments made. (Item 2; Item 7 at 1-2)
Applicant attributed the SSA debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.w to an alleged overpayment
of social security benefits that she received while unemployed. During her 2020 interview,
Applicant acknowledged that she received a letter from the SSA indicating that she was
overpaid,  but  disagreed  because  she  did  not  know  how  or  why  she  would  have  been
overpaid. She planned to investigate the matter. She intended to pay the debt if it was
determined that she did, in fact, owe the SSA for overpayment. In her SOR answer, she
asserted  that  she  set  up  a  payment  plan  to  resolve  the  issue.  She  did  not  offer
documentary proof of that plan or any payments made. (Item 2; Item 7 at 2)
The  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.u  ($1,236)  and  1.v  ($949)  are  two  credit-card
accounts  that  Applicant  had  through  the  same  company.  She  opened  them  to  pay for
expenses during periods of unemployment. They both became delinquent in November
2019 and were charged off in April 2020. In her SOR answer, Applicant stated that she
set  up  payment  plans  to  resolve  the  debts.  She  provided  documentary  proof  of  the
arrangement she made with the creditor in August 2021 to resolve the debt alleged in
SOR ¶ 1.u, but not of any payments she made pursuant to that arrangement. She did not
offer documentary proof of either a plan or any payments made towards the debt alleged
in SOR ¶ 1.v. (AE A; Item 2; Item 4 at 6; Item 7 at 2)
Applicant incurred the utility debt alleged in SOR  ¶ 1.x ($1,395) during a period
when  she  was  either  unemployed  or  underemployed.  During  her  2020  interview,
Applicant expressed an intent to contact the creditor to set up a payment plan. In her SOR
answer,  she  provided  documentary  proof  of  the  payment  plan  she  arranged  with  the
creditor in August 2021 to resolve this debt. However, she did not offer documentary proof
of any payments made pursuant to that plan. (AE B; Item 2; Item 7 at 2)
Applicant borrowed the funds alleged in SOR 1.z ($252) via a payday loan to pay
bills during a period when she was unemployed. She made a few payments on the loan
before she defaulted on it. During her 2020 interview, she did not express a specific plan
to pay this debt, but indicated that she intended to continue making progress on satisfying
all  of  her  then  delinquent  debts,  which  included  this  loan.  In  her  SOR  answer,  she
asserted: “There was no information on this company,” and did not offer a plan to resolve
this debt. (Item 2; Item 7 at 2)
Applicant’s  SCA  revealed  instability  in  her  employment  history,  including  five
periods  of  unemployment  and  extended  periods  of  part-time  employment  between
January 2010 and March 2020. Her unemployment appeared to have been involuntary in
all but one instance. The record did not indicate the reason that she worked on a part-
time  basis,  rather  than  full  time.  During  her  June  2020  security  clearance  interview,
Applicant described her financial situation as improving  because of her new job, which
not only provided her with steady employment but also a higher salary. She expressed
an intent to continue taking positive steps toward satisfying her debts. (Item 3; Item 7 at
2)
Applicant  reported  monthly  expenses  totaling  $1,650  on  her  February  2021
personal financial statement. Based on the year-to-date salary reported on her February
2021  pay  stub,  Applicant’s  take-home  pay  averaged  approximately  $2,119  per  month.
The pay stub indicated that her salary varied each pay period. The record did not indicate
her  previous  salary  or  expense  history,  or  whether  she  had  any  financial  counseling.
Applicant’s June 2021 credit report revealed that she opened two credit-card accounts in
2020, with $300 and $800 credit limits and balances of $171 and $496, respectively. Both
were in good standing. (Item 6 at 12-13).
