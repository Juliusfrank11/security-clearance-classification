East.  (Tr.  26;  AE  B)  He  believed  his  former  spouse  was  preparing  and  filing  his  tax
returns.  (Tr.  26)  His  spouse  told  Applicant  that  she  filed  their  tax  returns.  (Tr.  27)  He
subsequently learned his tax returns were not filed, and he said he filed his federal and
state tax returns in March or April of 2021. (Tr. 27-28) On June 29, 2021, the IRS wrote
Applicant and informed him his TYs 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns could not
be located. (GE 3 at 21, 25; AE B)
On March 8, 2021, Applicant filed his federal income tax return for TY 2019. (GE

the  IRS  notified  him  that  he  owed  about  $800  for TY  2019.  A  note  written  on  the  IRS
notice indicates the debt was paid on June 9, 2021. (Id.; AE A at 23/) Applicant’s monthly
gross income is about $11,500. (Tr. 31; AE A at 19) His monthly net remainder is about

years. (Tr. 41) I also requested that he provide  information from the state tax authority
about his taxes. (Tr. 42) He said he was going to show “due diligence” and provide the
tax  transcripts  and  tax  documents.  (Tr.  44)  He  did  not  provide  the  additional  tax
documentation after his hearing. (AE B) He did not establish that he filed his federal or
state income tax returns or paid his federal and state taxes for TYs 2017 and 2018. (AE

Personal Conduct
Applicant was focused on his mother’s health because she suffered from cancer
for about 30 months, and he was not thinking about taxes. (Tr. 29-30) Applicant returned
from overseas in 2017, and his mother died in February 2018. (Tr. 29-30) On October 29,
2019, Applicant indicated in his SCA that he timely filed his federal and state income tax
returns for the previous seven years. (SOR ¶ 2.a; GE 1 at 32) He did not disclose that he
failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2017 and 2018. (SOR ¶ 2.a;
GE 1)
On  December  16,  2019,  Applicant  volunteered  in  his  Office  of  Personnel
Management (OPM) interview that his federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2018
and 2019 had not been filed due to divorce proceedings. (GE 3 at 9) In his May 24, 2021
response to DOHA interrogatories, he disclosed that he had not filed his TY 2017 and
2018  federal and  state  income  tax  returns; however,  he  said  his TY  2019  federal  and
state income tax returns were filed in February 2021. (GE 3 at 11, 14)
Applicant said his failure to disclose that he had not filed his TYs 2017 and 2018
federal and state tax returns on his SCA was due to being unaware that his tax returns
were not filed. (Tr. 28) He believed his spouse had filed his tax returns, and he trusted
her. (Tr. 28-29) He was not divorced until October 2019. (Tr. 29)
