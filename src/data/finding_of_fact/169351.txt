In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a federal contractor. When he submitted
his SCA, he had been unemployed since November 2019. The record does not reflect
when he was hired by his current employer. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army
from January 2006 to April 2010 and received an honorable discharge. He received an
associate’s  degree  in  December  2017.  He  married  in  January  2007,  divorced  in  April
2009,  married  in  November  2009,  and  divorced  in  August  2015.  He  has  lived  with  a
cohabitant since June 2015. He has two children, ages 11 and 1.
After Applicant was discharged from the Army, he worked for several employers
from June 2010 to June 2015, when he was fired for sleeping on the job. He worked for
another  employer  from  June  2015  to  December  2016,  when  he  was  fired  for  poor
performance. He believes that he was fired because he and his supervisors disagreed
about how certain tasks should be performed. He was unemployed from January 2017 to
January 2018 while attending school under the GI Bill. He was employed from January to
May  2018, and  he  voluntarily left  that  job  because  he  believed  he was  underpaid  and
disrespected. He was employed from May 2018 to November 2019, when he was laid off.
He was unemployed until he was hired by his current employer. (GX 2 at 17-20; GX 3 at
5-7.)
The SOR alleges 20 delinquent debts totaling more than $45,000. They consist of
11 delinquent consumer debts, 6 delinquent student loans, a child-support arrearage, a
home foreclosure, and a vehicle repossession. The debts are reflected in credit reports
from August 2020 and May 2021. (GX 4 and 5.)
The home foreclosure alleged in SOR ¶ 1.s resulted in sale of the property and the
proceeds apparently were sufficient to satisfy the debt. (GX 4 at 5.) Regarding the vehicle
repossession in July 2016, alleged in SOR ¶ 1.t, Applicant stated in the PSI that the value
of  the  vehicle  at  the  time  of  repossession  was  about  $3,000,  and  that  the  sale  of  the
vehicle was sufficient to resolve the debt. (GX 3 at 10.) The debt apparently was satisfied
because there are only two auto loans reflected in the credit reports. The payments on
one auto loan are current, and the other loan was charged off for $1,002 in July 2020
(SOR ¶ 1.h), much later than the repossession admitted by Applicant. (GX 4 at 8, 10; GX
5 at 3, 6.)
At  the  time  of  the  September  2020  PSI,  Applicant  was  unemployed,  and  he
attributed all of his delinquent debts to lack of employment. He told the investigator that
he intended to contact his creditors and start making payments after he found a job. (GX
3 at 10-19.) He did not dispute any of the debts. He submitted no evidence of financial
counseling. He did not mention any specific attempts to resolve his debts in the PSI or
his response to the SOR. He did not respond to the FORM.
