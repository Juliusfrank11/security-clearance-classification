Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  in  ¶¶  1.a,  1.e  through  1.l,  and  1.p.  He
denied the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.b through 1.d, and 1.m through 1.o. After a thorough
and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 44 years old. He married in 2000 and divorced in October 2018. He
has  two  children  from  the  marriage,  ages  16  and  12.  He  was  employed  from  2001  to
2018.  He  was  unemployed  from  November  2018  until  July  2019.  He  worked  for  two
different employers until he was hired by his present employer in April 2020. (Item 3)
Applicant  and  his  wife  filed  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  in  2010  and  had  their  debts
discharged  in  2015.  He  and  his  wife  had  considerable  consumer  debt  and  judgments
discharged. (Item 2)
Since the bankruptcy discharge, Applicant has accumulated numerous delinquent
debts  that  are  alleged  in  the  SOR.  A  couple  became  delinquent  in  2018,  but  most
happened in 2020. He disputed three judgments that were alleged (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-$4,991;
1.c-$1,959; and 1.d- $7,145). It appears these are included in his bankruptcy discharge
and do not appear on his October 2020 credit report. These allegations are resolved in
Applicant’s favor. His bankruptcy was not alleged in the SOR. Any derogatory information
that  was  not  alleged  will  not  be  considered  for  disqualifying  purposes,  but  may  be
considered, in the application of mitigating conditions, and when making a whole-person
analysis.
Applicant  attributed  his  current  financial  difficulties  to  his  divorce  and  period  of
unemployment. In his June 2020 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed his
child support was in arrears (approximately $10,500) due to his unemployment. He noted
he  was  making  timely  payments  and  additional  payments  each  month  to  apply  to  the
arrearage. SOR ¶ 1.e reflects the amount in arrears is $11,137. He did not disclose any
other financial delinquencies. (Items 2, 3)
In  his  FORM  response,  Applicant  provided  a  copy  of  his  current  child  support
payment  record.  It  reflects  he  is  making  regular  payments  and  additional payments  to
reduce  the  arrearage.  As  of  July  2021  the  arrearage  balance  is  $6,803.  Applicant  is
resolving the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e. (Answer to SOR; AE H)
In October 2020, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator as part
of  his  background  investigation.  He  confirmed  with  the  investigator  his  child  support
arrearage, but did not disclose any other delinquent debts until confronted with them by
the investigator. For each delinquent debt alleged in the SOR, he explained that he could
not recall when the account was opened. He stated the accounts were held jointly with
his wife, and she was responsible for paying the debt, but agreed he would pay it and will
have it removed from his credit report. He intended to work with his ex-wife to get the
debts paid. He anticipated paying the delinquent accounts by November 2025. (Item 4)
Applicant acknowledged to the investigator that this debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($26,346),
was for an involuntary car repossession and there was likely a delinquent balance owed.
Applicant’s  October 2020  credit  report  shows  that  the  vehicle  was  repossessed  and  a
possible balance was due. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated his ex-wife was
paying this loan and he provided the page from his credit report showing that the current
balance owed is $15,569 as of June 2021, and that the account was closed in December
2018. It is likely the creditor agreed to return the vehicle to Applicant’s wife, permit her to
bring the payments current and allow her to make monthly payments. I find in Applicant’s
favor on this allegation. (Item 2 at page 61; Item 5)
Applicant stated that he is unable at this time to pay the charged-off debts alleged
in SOR ¶¶ 1.g ($1,844), 1.i ($1,046), and 1.p ($1,346), but intends to in the future. These
debts are unresolved. (Items 2, 5)
Applicant stated in his answer to the SOR that he was making payments of $200
on the collection account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f and had reduced the balance to $2,700.
He  did  not  provide  documents  to  substantiate  his  statement.  The  debt  is  unresolved.
(Items 2, 5)
Applicant provided a document to show that in October 2021, he made a payment
agreement with the creditor for the collection account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h ($1,571). He
will pay $77 a month until May 2022 to resolve the debt. This debt is being resolved. (AE
E)
In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he made a copy of the SOR and scribbled
notations next to some of the allegations. His notations do not substantiate that he has
made  payments  to  resolve  the  charged-off  store  card  account  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.j
($1,045). This debt is not resolved. (AE B)
Applicant provided a July 2021 payment agreement with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.k
($1,013) to pay $50 a month. He made payments in July, August, and September 2021.
The debt is being resolved. (AE J)
Applicant made four phone payments (three payments of $115 and one of $119)
from June 2021 to September 2021 for the charged-off store card account alleged in SOR
¶  1.l  ($694).  There  is  no  indication  that  Applicant  has  a  payment  agreement  with  the
creditor, but it does appear he is making regular payments towards the debt. Applicant is
resolving this debt. (AE C)
Applicant denied the collection account in SOR ¶ 1.m ($620) stating in his SOR
answer, “this account was taken care of on 2/22/21 and closed on 3/25/2021.” (Item 2)
He did not provide documents to substantiate the account was paid. It is unresolved.
Applicant denied the collection account for telecommunication services in SOR ¶
1.n ($362) indicating that “it will be paid off on 7/22/21.” He did not provide documents to
substantiate the account was paid. It is unresolved.
Applicant provided documents to show that he resolved the collection account for
the store credit account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.o ($407) in July 2021. (Item 2 page 60)
Applicant did not provide evidence of his current finances, income, expenses, or
budget. There is no evidence he has recently attended any type of financial counseling.
