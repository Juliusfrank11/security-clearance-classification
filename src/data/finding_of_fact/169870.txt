In her SOR answer, Applicant admitted all the allegations, with explanations. Her
admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She began working
at  her  present  job  in  January  2018.  She  is  a  high  school  graduate.  She  was  married
from 2010 to 2018, although she was separated from her husband since 2016. She has
a son, age 19, from another relationship. (Tr. 6, 18, 20; GE 1)
The SOR alleged 17 delinquent debts totaling approximately $36,000. The debts
are  comprised  of  collections  and  charged-off  accounts  (credit  cards,  consumer  debts,
and an auto repossession). The debts are established by Applicant’s security clearance
application  (SCA),  her  background  interview  in  June  2019,  credit  reports  from  March
2020,  February  2021,  and  November  2021,  and  her  SOR  admissions  in  her  answer.
(GE 1-5; SOR Answer)
Applicant  attributes  her financial problems to  several things,  including being the
sole income producer when she was married; being separated in 2016, then divorced in
2018,  and  not  receiving  any  financial  support  from  her  ex-husband;  not  receiving  any
child support from her son’s father (she claimed that he owed about $70,000 in past-due
child support); being let go from her job in 2017; and having to rely on unemployment
benefits  and  credit  cards  to  make  ends  meet.  Because  of  these  factors,  Applicant
claimed she was unable to address any of her debts and they all remain delinquent. (Tr.
19-20, 24, 30-31, 33)
Appellant admitted  that she  sold  the marital home  in  2019  and  received  proceeds
of  approximately  $80,000. She  did not address any  of  her delinquent debts with  these
proceeds, rather  she  paid her ex-husband  $30,000 as part of the  divorce settlement and
used  $50,000  to  purchase  a  home  for her mother. She  also  went on  vacation  with  her
son.  She   has  not  sought  out  any   financial  counseling.  She   thought  about  looking   into
filing  for bankruptcy  protection,  but she  never followed  up  on  doing  so.  She  was given
approximately   two   months’  time   after  her  hearing   to   present   evidence   that   she   was
pursuing  a  loan  consolidation  plan  or  bankruptcy  protection, but she  did not  submit any
supporting  documentation.  She  has  not addressed  any  of her  debts. (Tr. 21,  23-24,  38-
39; AE 2)
