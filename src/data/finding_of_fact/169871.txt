Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.i, and 2.a. He denied the SOR
allegations in ¶¶ 1.b through 1.h. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,
testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 59 years old. He earned some college credits, but not a degree. He
was married from 1987 to 2004 and from 2007 to 2009. Both marriages ended in divorce.
He  has  two  grown  children.  He  has  been  working  for  his  present  employer  since
December 2018 and has been steadily employed since February 2017. He stated that he
would like to serve his government. (Transcript (Tr.) 19-22, 52; GE 1)
Applicant  and  his  father  were  in  business  together.  Originally  Applicant  owned
three  shops  and  his father owned  ten  shops.  They  merged  their  businesses.  At  some
point, Applicant was the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer. It is unknown
if  or  when  his  father  no  longer  participated  in  the  business.  Applicant  had  about  300
employees. He was aware he was required to withhold federal payroll taxes  and FICA
payments associated with the business and turn it over to the IRS. He had complied with
this requirement in the past. At some point, he experienced financial difficulties, and did
not turn over the payments he withheld from his employees to the IRS as required. He
testified that he was trying to keep his employees paid. (Tr. 24-37; GE 6)
Applicant was charged criminally and in about January 2010, he pled guilty and
was found guilty for failure to pay over withholding and FICA taxes for tax year 2004. Five
other  charges  were  dismissed  as  part  of  his  plea  agreement.  He  was  sentenced  to
imprisonment  for  12  months  and  one  day  and  required  to  make  restitution  in  the
approximate amount of $148,702. Applicant testified that he served six months in federal
prison and the remaining six months and a day in a halfway house. The plea agreement
required that he pay $100 a month, based on his income. (Tr. 24-37; GE 6)
In Applicant’s January 2019 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed his
periods of unemployment from September 2015 to February 2017. Applicant testified that
he made the monthly restitution payments until he got sick, and he was unemployed and
on disability. He said 15% of his disability payment was garnished to pay the restitution
during this time. Applicant resumed working in  February 2017. He testified that he has
not resumed paying the required restitution. He said he contacted the Government about
resuming his payments, but was told his wages would be garnished. They were not. Since
at least January 2017, he did not contact the Government about resuming payments and
has  not  made  any  payments  from  the  time  his  pay  was  garnished  until  the  present.
Applicant  testified that a few days  prior to his  hearing,  the Government froze his bank
account and put a levy on his checking account. He testified that he is now in negotiations
for resolving his restitution issues. He said he has been saving his money in anticipation
of  resuming his restitution  payments and  has  put about  $11,000  in  his 401(k) pension
plan.  He  does  not  know  how  to  withdraw  money  from  this  account,  but  he  is  making
inquiries  for  help  in  doing  so.  He  stated  that  he  has  paid  approximately  $15,000  in
restitution. No supporting documents were provided. (Tr. 24-40, 50-51; GE 1, 6)
Applicant testified that he did not initiate contact with the Government because he
was scared. He stated that he has filed his past income tax returns, and he owes federal
income taxes for tax years 2004, 2012, and other tax years that he could not recall. He
estimated he owes approximately $10,000 in delinquent federal income taxes. Applicant
testified that he also  owes approximately $7,000 to $8,000 for state income taxes and
also business taxes for his now defunct business. He does not know the amount and has
no payment plan at this time to resolve these taxes. (Tr. 38-40, 44-45)
Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR, will not be considered
for  disqualifying  purposes,  but  may  be  considered  in  the  application  of  mitigating
conditions, when making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis.
The SOR alleged a charged-off credit card debt (¶ 1.a -$18,349) and medical debts
(¶¶  1.b  through  1.h-totalling  approximately  $2,128).  Applicant  admitted  the  credit  card
debt, which he said became delinquent in December 2015, when he was sick and could
not pay it. He testified he contacted the creditor in either 2016 or 2017 and told them he
could not pay the debt. He believed the debt was written-off as a bad debt by the creditor.
No other information was provided. The debt is not resolved. (Tr. 40-44)
Applicant denied all of the medical debts in the SOR. He stated that he was on
disability when the debts were incurred, and they should have been paid by Medicaid. He
stated he contacted the creditors and disputed them over the telephone and also disputed
them  with  the  credit  bureaus.  He  indicated  he  would  attempt  to  find  the  documents
regarding  his  disputes.  No  information  was  provided  regarding  the  resolution  of  his
disputes or other documents to support he is not responsible for these debts. All of the
alleged  SOR  debts  are  supported  by  credit  reports  from  January  2022,  March  2021,
September 2019, and January 2019. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 40-44; GE 2, 3, 4,
