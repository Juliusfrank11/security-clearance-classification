West Bank, Palestine
There have been no national elections in the West Bank since 2006. Palestinian
Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas has remained in office despite expiration of his
term in 2009. The Palestinian Legislative Council has not functioned since 2007. As of
September 23, 2020, the U.S. Department of State Travel Advisory for the West Bank
was Level 3, because of COVID-19 restrictions, terrorism, and civil unrest. Terrorists may
attack with little or no warning  targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets,
shopping  malls,  and  local  government  facilities.  Multiple  terrorist  organizations  have  a
presence in the West Bank. These groups often express anti-U.S. sentiments. The PA
engages in numerous human rights violations. The PA has taken some steps to address
abuses and impunity.
