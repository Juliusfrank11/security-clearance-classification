In his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c, he partially admitted and
partially  denied  SOR  ¶  1.a,  and  he  denied  SOR  ¶  1.d,  each  with  brief  narrative
explanations. Applicant’s admissions and explanations are incorporated into the findings
of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence  submitted, I
make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 44 years old. He has been employed by a defense contractor since
2013.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  military  from  1996  until  he  was  honorably
discharged  in  2005.  He  is  applying  for  a  security  clearance  for  the  first  time  since  he
was  in  the  military.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2015,  and  a  master’s  degree  in
2017. He was married in 1998 and divorced in 2008. He has no children. (Items 3, 7)
The  SOR  concerns  several  years  of  unfiled  Federal  income  tax  returns,  a
delinquent  tax  debt,  and  one  unpaid  medical  debt.  The  allegations  are  established  by
Applicant’s admissions and the record evidence.
Applicant  disclosed  in  his  SCA,  that  he  failed  to  file  his  2016  –  2018  Federal
income tax returns. In addressing his unfiled tax returns, Applicant stated that he had a
balance due with the IRS, and that the IRS had kept his refunds to address it. He stated
that he intended to file his past-due tax returns after the resolution of the debt. Applicant
also  stated  that  he  sought  pro-bono  representation  to  resolve  this  debt,  but  was
unsuccessful. (Item 3)
Applicant  submitted  tax  account  records  in  response  to  an  interrogatory.  Those
tax account transcripts show that as of November 2020, his 2016 return was unfiled and
his 2017 and 2018 returns were filed late. In his answer to SOR ¶¶ 1.a & 1.b, Applicant
stated that he filed all of  his overdue tax returns in May and August of 2020, and was
due  a  refund  for  each  year.  Notwithstanding  his  admission  to  SOR  ¶  1.b,  Applicant’s
2019 return was filed on time. (Items 2, 3, 4, 7)
SOR  ¶  1.c  concerns  $12,607  in  past-due  Federal  income  taxes  from  tax  year
2011.  This  is  established  by  Applicant’s  IRS  account  balance,  submitted  with  his
interrogatory  response,  and  by  his  admission.  He  stated  that  he  incurred  this  debt
because  of  a  401K  withdrawal  due  to  unemployment,  and  that  he  used  the  funds  to
provide  for  his  family.  He  stated  that  the  IRS  had  told  him  this  debt  was  in  a  “do  not
collect”  status  in  2012.  He  stated  that  he  did  not  make  any  payments  on  this  debt  to
prevent  “taking  funds  from  my  family,”  and  that  he  had  relied  on  the  fact  that  the  IRS
kept his subsequent tax refunds to reduce his tax debt. However, Applicant reported in
his SCA that he was divorced in 2008, and has no children. (Items 2, 3, 4, 7)
Further,  Applicant  did  not  indicate  any  periods  of  unemployment  since  1996  on
his SCA. While  he  changed  jobs  in  2011,  he  provided  no  information  to  show  that  his
financial  situation  dramatically  changed.  The  record  also  indicates  that  he  has  been
gainfully  employed,  with  his  current  employer,  since  2013.  Despite  this,  Applicant
provided no evidence of any payments towards his past-due Federal tax debt from tax
year  2011.  Applicant   provided   no   information   more  recent   than   his  interrogatory
response regarding the status of this debt.  (Items 2, 3, 4, 7)
Applicant’s  tax  account  transcripts  also  show  a  history  of  delinquent  Federal
income  tax  debts  for  other,  earlier  tax  years,  going  back  to  2006.  Those  debts  were
resolved  through  involuntary refund  offsets from  tax years 2015,  2017, and  2018,  and
not  through  Applicant’s  own  active  efforts.  Having  been  resolved  previously,  they  are
not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Since  Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM,  he  did  not
provide any updated information about the current status of his Federal tax debt and the
unfiled 2016 tax return. (Item 4)
SOR ¶ 1.d, which Applicant denied, is an unpaid $146 medical debt. It is listed on
Applicant’s 2019 and 2020 credit reports as being unpaid since at least 2015. While he
claims it was paid in 2019, he did not provide any corroborating documentation. (Items
2, 5, 6, 7)
