In  Applicant’s SOR  response,  he  admitted SOR  allegations.  (¶¶ 1.a, 1.b,  1.c,  1.d, and
2.a.) He qualified his admission to ¶ 1.b, that alleged he had used THC while granted access to
classified  information,  with  the  qualification  “if  that’s  what  I  wrote  then  I  admit.”  There  is  no
evidence in the record that Applicant wrote (or stated) that he had used marijuana while holding
a security clearance or while having access to classified information. He did not specifically admit
or deny ¶¶ 3.a, and 4.a. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. (Item 1)
Applicant is 59 years old. He married in 1992 and divorced in 2013, and currently lives
with  a  cohabitant.  Since  September  2018,  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  a  defense
contractor.  Applicant  listed  on  his  April  2019  SCA  that  he  previously  held  a  DOD  security
clearance in approximately 1982. The Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) showed that
Applicant  had  been  granted  a  secret  security  clearance  in  February  2006.  There  is  no  other
evidence that was submitted to show the specific period of time Applicant possessed his security
clearance, whether it was for one month, one year, or if Applicant continuously held the security
clearance from February 2006 through January 2013. (Items 3, 4 and 6)
The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant smoked marijuana (THC) with varying
frequency from about January 1979 to January 2013. His heaviest use occurred during his high
school years and he used marijuana occasionally in his 30s and 40s. Over the course of his life
Applicant  estimated  he  has  used  marijuana  on  about  100  occasions.  He  used  LSD  and
psilocybin mushrooms (hallucinogens) from about 1979 to 2005. His heaviest use occurred in
high school, but he did use these substances again in his 40s. Applicant used cocaine from 1985
to 1995. He experimented with this drug and never enjoyed the experience. Over the course of
ten  years  he  used  cocaine  about  ten  times.  He  has  no  plans  to  use  any  of  these  illegal
substances in the future. (Items 1, 2, 3 and 4)
Applicant  self-reported his illegal drug history on  the  SCA he  signed  in  April 2019.  He
listed that he had not used any illegal drugs while he held a DOD security clearance. During his
background interview in June 2019, which was certified by Applicant in November 2020, he told
the investigator that he had not used any illegal substance while holding a security clearance.
Applicant also responded to an interrogatory question which specifically asked whether he had
used  any  illegal  drugs  after  he  had  been  granted  a  security  clearance  in  February  2006.
Applicant responded; “No.” (Items 1, 2, 3 and 4)
Applicant was granted a security clearance in February 2006, about eight months after
he had been hired by a different federal contractor. Department Counsel argued in the brief that
one  could  assume  that  Applicant  continuously held  a  security  clearance  from  February 2006
until September 2015, when he left that employment. According to Applicant’s admissions, his
use  of  marijuana  until  January  2013  overlapped  with  his  employment  and  possession  of  a
security clearance  if  he  held  it  continuously from  February 2006  until he  left  the  employment
position in September 2015. JPAS reflected the date the security clearance was issued, but it
did not reflect the length of time Applicant possessed the security clearance. (Items 3 and 6)
Under Guideline  G it  alleged  that Applicant  was arrested  in March 2017  for Driving  Under
the   Influence   of  Alcohol.   (DUI)   He   was  found   guilty   and   was  sentenced   to   restricted   driving
privileges  for six   months,  to   serve   eight   days  in   the  Sheriff’s   work program,  completion  of  an
alcohol education  program, fined about $1,900, and he was placed  on three years of probation.
This alcohol-related  allegation  (¶ 2.a) and  all  of  the  allegations under Guideline  H (¶¶  1.a  through
1.d) were cross-alleged  under Guideline J (¶  3.a).  The  allegation that Applicant used marijuana
while  possessing  a  security  clearance  (¶  1.b) was cross-alleged  under  Guideline  E  (¶  4.a).  (Items
1, 2, 3,  4, and 5)
Applicant told the investigator during his June 2019 background interview that this arrest
in 2017 was his only alcohol-related arrest. He successfully completed his court-ordered alcohol
education program and was not recommended to participate in any other alcohol treatment. He
consumed alcohol about three times weekly from the age of 21 until November 2015, when his
mother  passed  away.  After  November  2015  he  consumed  a  greater  volume  of  alcohol  more
frequently. He would consume a couple glasses of wine and on occasion, a shot of bourbon.
After  his  March  2017  DUI  arrest,  he  greatly  reduced  his  alcohol  consumption.  He  told  the
investigator  that  he  did  not  have  a  problem  with  alcohol  and  the  2017  DUI  was  an  isolated
incident. In the 2020 interrogatories,  Applicant reported that he completely stopped all use of
alcohol in October 2019. He also quit smoking tobacco for health, spiritual, and mental reasons.
