Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  September  2009.  He  applied  for  and  obtained  a  security
clearance  in  2010.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  December  2004  and  took
additional college courses in 2009 without earning another degree. Applicant has been
married since May 2000 and has three children. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6)
Applicant  used  marijuana  from  March  2006  until  December  2006  to  attempt  to
relieve  stress  and  headaches.  During  this  2006  timeframe,  he  used  marijuana  about
four to six times per month. He claimed he stopped using marijuana in December 2006
because he did not believe that his marijuana use was helping with his stress.  (Items 5,
6)
From  April  2014  to  February  2019,  Applicant  used  marijuana  for  recreational
purposes  and  to  help  alleviate  stress  and  insomnia.  He  used  marijuana  about  two  to
four times per week for a total of about 500 times over four and a half years. Applicant
used marijuana with his wife, to whom he is still married, and with whom he still resides.
He  used  marijuana  while  holding a  security clearance  throughout this period.  There  is
no  evidence  that  Applicant  reported  his  2014  to  2019  marijuana  use  to  his  employer.
Applicant claimed that he will no longer use marijuana as he does not like the effects it
has on him. (Items 3, 4)
Applicant  reported  his  relevant marijuana use  on  the Questionnaire for National
Security  Positions  (SF  86)  he  submitted  in  January  2020  and  September  2009.  He
discussed his marijuana use when he was interviewed for his background investigation
in April 2020 and December 2009. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6)
Under  Guidelines  H  and  E,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant’s  illegal  drug  use  from
2014 to 2019 while he held a security clearance. In his response to the SOR, Applicant
admitted the Guideline H marijuana use allegation. He denied the Guideline E personal
conduct allegation, stating that,  while  he  may have  shown  “questionable judgment,” he
was  open  and honest about his marijuana  use  during the 2020  investigative  process.2
(Items 1, 2)
2 Applicant’s 2006 marijuana usage was not alleged in the SOR. As such, I will not consider  it under the
disqualifying factors, but I  will consider  it when  applying matters of extenuation and mitigation.
