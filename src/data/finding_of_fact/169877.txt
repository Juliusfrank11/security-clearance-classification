Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings
of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I
make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  32  years  old.  He  has  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  (DC)  since
January 2014. He holds a master’s degree. He is married and has a one-year old child.
(Tr. 31, 33; GE1)
Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged Applicant used or misused the following drugs
with varying frequency: marijuana from April 2008 to June 2018; cocaine from September
2011  to  December 2017; methamphetamines  from  September 2011  to  Summer 2017;
Adderall  from  December  2018  to  June  2019;  and  Trazodone  from  August  2017  to
September  2017.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.e)  It  alleged  that  Applicant  sold  marijuana  from
September  2009  to  Summer  2011.  (SOR  ¶  1.f)  It  alleged  that  Applicant  purchased:
marijuana from April 2008 to September 2015; methamphetamines from September 2011
to Summer 2017; and Adderall without a prescription from December 2008 to June 2019.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.g-1.i) It also alleged that Applicant used illegal drugs and misused prescription
drugs after being granted a security clearance in June 2016. (SOR ¶ 1.j)
Under Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleged the allegations stated above in SOR ¶¶
1.a-1.j. (SOR ¶ 2.a) The SOR alleged that Applicant was charged with leaving the scene
of an accident (alcohol involved) in May 2013 and charged with driving under the influence
of alcohol in May 2014. (SOR ¶¶ 2.b-2.c) It alleged that Applicant deliberately gave false
information on his September 2015 security clearance application (SCA) when he failed
to disclose his illegal drug activity as stated in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d and 1.f-1.i above. (SOR ¶¶
2.d-2.f)  It  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately  gave  false  information  on  his  September
2015 SCA and his July 2019 SCA when he stated that alcohol was not involved with his
May 2013 arrest for leaving the scene of an accident. (SOR ¶¶ 2.g-2.h)
Applicant admitted all of his illegal drug use, his prescription drug misuse, his 2013
and 2014 charges, and his deliberate false answers given on his 2015 and 2019 SCAs.
(Tr.  25,  30,  34-35;  SOR  Answer)  In  Applicant’s  2019  SCA,  during  his  February  2020
background interview, and in response to DOHA interrogatories, he set forth his extensive
drug history which  began  in approximately 2008.  He began using marijuana as a high
school  senior  in  2008.  He  continued  using  marijuana  while  attending  college.  He
increased his use frequency from two to three times a month to using it multiple times a
day by his sophomore year in college. At that time, he also began selling marijuana. He
sold  and  distributed  marijuana  during  his  sophomore  and  junior  years.  He  made  a
monetary profit by selling marijuana and obtained it free for his own personal use. During
his senior year of college, he was asked to leave his fraternity because of his drug use.
His  drug  supplier  was  arrested  for  trafficking,  and  he  lost  that  source  of  marijuana  for
himself. He found a new source and continued to buy marijuana so that he could use it
on a daily basis throughout his senior year. Applicant continued his marijuana use through
2016 when he obtained a security clearance. He has used marijuana “several  hundred
times.” He claims his last use of marijuana was in June 2018. He ate a marijuana-laced
chocolate bar. When reporting his use in his July 2019 SCA, he claimed he “accidentally”
ate the marijuana-laced chocolate bar. In his later February 2020 background interview,
he told the investigator that he intentionally and knowingly ate the chocolate bar. He held
a security clearance at the time of this knowing use of marijuana. Without specifying what
drug it was, Applicant testified that his last use of illegal drugs was on December 31, 2018.
He deliberately failed to list his illegal marijuana use on his September 2015 SCA because
he believed that if he answered truthfully he would not receive a security clearance. (Tr.
23, 25, 28, 30, 34; GE 1-3)
Applicant’s  other  admitted  drug  involvement  included:  (1)  cocaine—first  use
September 2011—last use  December 2017—frequency,  twice  a  year from  2011-2013,
once  in  2017;  (2)  methamphetamines—first  use  September  2011—last  use  summer
2017—frequency,  once  or  twice  a  year  from  2011  to  2017;  (3)  Adderall—first  use
December 2008—last use January 2019 (Applicant gives conflicting versions of his last
use  of  Adderall  in  his  background  interview  where  he  stated  his  last  uses  were  from
January to June 2019)—frequency, monthly to quarterly from 2008-2014, once or twice
a year 2014-2019; (4) Trazodone—first use August 2017—last use September 2017—
frequency, once or twice. He did not have a legal prescription for Adderall and Trazodone
at the time he used them. He purchased the drugs from someone who had a prescription.
He purchased the methamphetamines he used from an unknown source. The cocaine he
used was either given to him by friends or his girlfriend (now wife) purchased it for their
use. He deliberately failed to list his pre-2015 drug use and prescription drug abuse on
his  2015  SCA.  He  used  all  these  drugs  when  he  held  a  security  clearance.  Applicant
believed that even though he held a clearance at the time of his uses, he did not yet have
access to any cleared information so he did not think there was a problem. He did not
reveal his overall drug history to his current employer until after his  security clearance
hearing. (Tr. 29; GE 1-3; AE J-K)
Applicant admitted that he deliberately gave false information on both his 2015 and
2019 SCAs when he stated that alcohol was not involved when he was ordered to seek
alcohol counseling by the court as a result of his 2013 arrest. (Tr. 34-35; GE 1-2)
Applicant  has  not  participated  in  any  drug  counseling.  He  was  court-ordered  to
attend alcohol counseling related to his 2013 and 2014 arrests. His wife continues to use
both marijuana and cocaine, despite having an infant child. (Tr. 32-33)
Applicant is involved in community activities such as Habitat for Humanity and First
Robotics. He provided work documentation, which he believes shows that he has matured
and  become  a  leader  within  his  company.  He  reported  an  employee  for  not  following
security procedures. He also presented his work performance appraisals for years 2014,
2015, and 2020. He received overall ratings of “exceeded commitments” (rating of 4 out
of 5) for 2014, “exceeded commitments” (rating of 4.1 out of 5) for 2015, and “significantly
exceeded”  (no  numerical  value  given)  for  2020.  Applicant  also  presented  a  standard
operating  procedure  (SOP)  that  he  developed.  He  stated  in  his  testimony,  and  in  his
answer to interrogatories in November 2020, that he did not intend to use illegal drugs or
misuse  prescription  drugs  in  the  future.  He  lives  in  a  state  where  marijuana  use  and
possession is legal under state law. (Tr. 24, 28, 37-39; GE 1, 3; AE A-I)
