In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations.  His  admissions  are
adopted as a findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He began  working
at  his  present  job  in  April  2016.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  and  the  Air  National
Guard  for  approximately  six  years.  He  received  an  honorable  discharge.  He  holds  a
bachelor’s degree. He was married from 2010 to 2016. He has three minor children, for
whom  he  pays  child  support.  He  has  never  missed  a  payment,  even  though  it  has
caused him to miss some of his other financial obligations. (Tr. 6, 18-19, 23-24, 34, 36;
GE 1)
The SOR alleged Applicant failed to file his 2011 state income tax return and that
a state tax lien was entered against him in 2016 for $5,201. The SOR also alleged five
loans,  an  automobile
collection  accounts  and
repossession,  and  consumer  debts)  totaling  approximately  $73,780.  The  debts  are
established  by  credit  reports  from  June  2018,  August  2019,  and  April  2021,  and
November 2021; Appellant’s SOR admissions; and his hearing testimony. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a
– 1.i). (Tr. 19; GE 4-7)
two  charged-off  debts  (student
Applicant  explained  that  his financial  troubles  began  when  he  got  divorced  and
he  was  required  to  pay  spousal  and  child  support  that  essentially  amounted  to  half  of
his  pay  check.  The  spousal  support  ended  in  February  2021,  but  his  child-support
payments  continued  at  $1,800  per  month.  In  July  2021,  his  ex-wife  agreed  to  accept
$500  monthly  child  support  in  exchange  for  Applicant  having  custody  of  the  children
every weekend. His daughter also has special needs. Applicant provided documentation
showing  that  he  has  made  four  payments  of  $300  toward  his  state  tax  debt.  Those
payments were all after the SOR was issued (August 2021, October 20121, November
2021, and December 2021). He claims he filed his 2011 state tax return, but provided
no documentation to corroborate his assertion. (Tr. 19-20, 27; AE D)
Applicant has not made payments toward any of the remaining debts, nor has he
set up any types of plans to address the debts. He contacted a credit-repair company,
but the company has not addressed any of his delinquent debts. His student loan debts
were  acquired  before  he  enlisted  in  the  Air  Force  and  have  been  delinquent  since
August 2019. (Tr. 27, 29, 31, 33, 35; AE B)
Applicant also admitted in his testimony that he has not filed his state income tax
returns "in the  last few years”  and that he failed to file his federal tax returns for 2018,
2019,  and  2020.  I  will  not  consider  this  information  for  disqualification  purposes,  but  I
may  consider  it  to  determine  credibility,  the  applicability  of  mitigating  conditions,  and
during  my  whole-person  analysis.  Applicant’s  current  yearly  gross
is
approximately $88,000. (Tr. 29-30, 33)

Applicant  supplied a  letter from  a  coworker,  who  wrote  that Applicant  is a  good
man and good father. (AE C)
