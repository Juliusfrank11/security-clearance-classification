In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through
1.h, and 1.j through 1.p. (HE 3) He provided some information about the current status of
his debts: he disputed the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e; he did not admit or deny the debt in SOR ¶
1.i; and he paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.m. (Id.) He also provided mitigating
information. (Id.) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 61-year-old account manager. (Tr. 17-18; GE 1) In 1979, he received
an associate’s degree in electronics. (Tr. 17, 33; GE 1 at 13) He attended college for three
years. (Tr. 33) He married in 2002, and his two children are ages 12 and 17. (Tr. 17)
Financial Considerations
Applicant and his spouse were partners in the ownership and management of a
limited liability corporation (LLC) from 2002 to 2018. (Tr. 19) His LLC sold items totaling
about $15,000,000  through Internet-based sales. (Tr. 19-20; SOR response)  He has a
patent and trade marks for various products. (SOR response; AE F) He and his spouse
obtained  multiple  credit  cards  from  2003  to  2005,  which  he  used  to  fund  business
operations.  (Tr.  32)  His  LLC  had  financial  problems  beginning  around  2012  to  2013
because of increased Internet advertising costs to such an extent that his LLC was losing
money. (Tr. 19-20) He unsuccessfully tried several strategies to reduce costs. (Tr. 20-21)
In 2018, Applicant and his spouse closed the LLC. (Tr. 21) Applicant contended the debts
were the responsibility of the LLC and not his personal responsibility. (Tr. 56) He did not
provide the contracts used to obtain the credit or other documentation showing the LLC
was responsible for the debts, or that he was not responsible for the debts. (Tr. 58-59)
Applicant’s SOR alleges 16  delinquent debts totaling  $161,160 as follows: ¶ 1.a
for $30,429; ¶ 1.b for $26,452; ¶ 1.c for $26,075; ¶ 1.d for $18,096; ¶ 1.e for $16,395;
¶ 1.f for $12,030; ¶ 1.g for $6,642; ¶ 1.h for $4,803; ¶ 1.i for $3,356; ¶ 1.j for $3,338; ¶ 1.k
for $3,183; ¶ 1.l for $3,026; 1.m for $2,900; 1.n for $2,019; 1.o for $1,699; and 1.p for
$717. (HE 2) According to the SOR, the following debts are charged off: ¶ 1.a through ¶
1.e; ¶ 1.h; ¶ 1.i;  ¶ 1.l; ¶ 1.m; ¶ 1.o; and ¶ 1.p. The following SOR debts are in collections:
¶ 1.f; ¶ 1.g; ¶ 1.j; ¶ 1.k; and ¶ 1.n.
Applicant used multiple credit cards and bank accounts to pay business expenses.
(Tr.  23;  SOR  response)  He  discussed  settlements  with  some  creditors;  however,  they
said  he  had  to  be  in  default  a  minimum  of  120  days  before  they  would  negotiate  a
settlement with him. (Tr. 22, 56) When the LLC was closed, it had about $874,000 in debt,
and he was able to settle 60 to 70 percent of the debt. (Tr. 22, 29) He used a home equity
loan for $180,000 to pay some of the LLC-related debts. (SOR response) Other creditors
would  not  discuss  a  settlement,  particularly  after  the  debt  was  charged  off.  (Tr.  23)
Applicant did not retain any documentation about his proposals to settle debts, except for
the documentation presented at his hearing and in his SOR response. (Tr. 50-52) Some
SOR debts, including the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.j, and 1.p, were dropped from
his  credit  report  because  he  was  in  default  more  than  seven  years.  (Tr.  24-28)  Some
debts remain on his credit report in charged-off status, for example, the same creditor is
listed  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  ($30,429),  1.b  ($26,452),  1.c  ($26,075),  1.e  ($16,395),  and  1.i
($3,356), and his January 7, 2022 Experian credit report shows three charged-off debts
for that creditor in the amounts of $26,075, $26,452, and $30,429 with each debt having
“66  potentially  negative  months.”  (AE  D)  Evidently,  seven  years  without  payments  will
elapse in mid-2023 (84 negative months), and those three debts will be dropped from his
credit report. The SOR ¶ 1.i account was removed from his credit report, and he did not
remember whether he paid it. (Tr. 26)
Applicant said the  creditor for the  debts in ¶¶  1.h  ($4,803), 1.k ($3,183), and  1.l
($3,026)  sued   his   company,  and   he   settled   and   paid   off   the   debt   without  litigating   the
merits of his liability  in court. (Tr. 25-26) On  April  16, 2018, a  state  court issued  a  dismissal
upon  stipulated  terms for a  lawsuit listing  the  creditor in SOR ¶¶  1.h, 1.k,  and  1.j as the
plaintiff,   and   “[Applicant   by   name],  et.   al.,”   as  the   defendant(s)   (not   the   LLC).  (SOR
response  at 4) The  settlement terms  were that  the  defendant  was required  to  pay  $1,000
on  April 26, 2018, and  $404  monthly  until $10,690  is paid. (Id.) The  LLC’s  name  appeared
on  the  bottom  of  the  page, near the  name  of the  defendant,  which was Applicant’s name.
(Id.)  Applicant’s  counsel signed  as  attorney  for the  plaintiff  as  opposed  to  attorney  for  the
LLC.  (Id.)   Applicant  suggested   that  maybe   they   put  his  name   on   the   heading   for  the
lawsuit because  he  was the  party  in contact with  the  creditor about the  debt.  (Tr. 57-58)
On  May  12, 2020, the creditor wrote  that the settlement amount for the  debts in SOR ¶¶
1.h,   1.k,   and   1.l  was  paid,   and   the   debt  was  resolved.  (Tr.  47;  AE   B)   The   creditor’s
correspondence was addressed to Applicant by name  and not to his  LLC. (AE B)
On June 21, 2017, Applicant agreed to settle the debt in SOR ¶ 1.m ($2,900) with
a current balance of $4,200 under the following terms: pay $2,500 on July 21, 2017, with
the  remaining  $1,700  balance  to  be  paid  in  36  monthly  installments  of  $47.  (AE  A)
Applicant paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.m. (Tr. 27, 47) Applicant said the debt in SOR ¶ 1.n
for $2,019 was the same debt as the debt in SOR ¶ 1.m. (Tr. 27)
Applicant said  his spouse  opened  some  of the  accounts.  (Tr. 28) He  did not specify
which  accounts   she   opened,  and   he   did  not  claim   that   any   of   them   were  solely   her
responsibility. Applicant contended the  LLC was liable  for the  unpaid SOR debts, and he
was not personally  liable for them.  (Tr. 28)  Applicant did  not receive  any  IRS  Form  1099-
C, cancellation  of indebtedness, documents  from the creditors. (Tr. 49)
Applicant worked on negotiations with the creditors for about two years after he
defaulted, and then he learned about his state’s  three-year statute of limitations from a
credit counseling service. He waited for the three-year state statute of limitations to expire
in some instances for debts. (Tr. 52, 54)  He explained  his rationale for handling of  his
debts as follows:
[S]o  I was really holding out for those  three years for some  of these  charge
offs. So  once  I reached  the  three  years, I  thought I was in a  good  position
to  renegotiate  now  because  they  - - you  know, I have  nothing  to  lose, and
they have everything to gain. So, I did contact them three years afterwards
because   I  was  in  a   strong   position,  and   they   were  still   not  interested   in
making a settlement. (Tr. 52-53)
Applicant’s federal and  state  income  taxes are  current.  (Tr. 30) He is  not delinquent
on  any  federal debts.  (Tr. 30) His mortgage  on  his residence  is almost paid. (Tr. 30)  His
net monthly  salary  after deductions  for taxes and  for his retirement account  is $8,200. (Tr.
35) Last year,  he  received  an  additional $97,000  in commissions. (Tr. 35) He  estimated
his after tax  income  in  2021  to  be  about $250,000. He  has  about $250,000  in his savings
account.  (Tr. 36) He owns several properties and  has  stock and  crypto  coin investments.
(Tr. 36-47)  He estimated  his net worth  to  be  about $2.5  million. (Tr.  60)  His credit score
is in the 700s. (SOR response) He was unable to  file  for bankruptcy because his income
was too high. (Tr. 55)
Character Evidence
Applicant’s character evidence, an award from a previous employer, performance
evaluations, and management of a successful business support granting him access to
classified information, and are important indicators of his excellent potential for important
contributions  to  the  national  defense.  (AE  G-J)  The  general  sense  of  his  character
evidence  is  that  Applicant  is  honest,  thoughtful,  diligent,  responsible,  loyal,  generous,
kind, and exceptionally intelligent. Applicant is not an alcoholic or a gambler, and he does
not live beyond his means. (Tr. 61) He is patriotic, and he never does anything that is
criminal or illegal. (Tr. 61)
