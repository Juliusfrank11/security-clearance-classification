Applicant is a 40-year-old civilian employee of a defense contractor who seeks a
security clearance. Applicant denied generally  each of  the allegations  in the SOR  with
explanations covering the financial allegations that included admissions. Findings of fact
follow.
Background
Applicant married  in October 2009  and  has one  child  (a  son, age  17). (GE 1;  Tr.
59) He  attended   college   classes  between   August  2017  and   January   2020,  but  did   not
earn a  diploma. (GE 1) More recently, he  completed  six  on-line  credits for his enrolled
business  courses.  (AE  H;  Tr.  56)  Applicant  enlisted  in  the  Air  Force  in September  2001
and   served   15   years  of   active   duty.  He  received   an   honorable   discharge   in  January
2016. (GE 1; Tr. 56)
Since January 2016, Applicant has been employed by his current employer (who
has undergone several name changes since then) as a scheduler. (GE 1 and AE J; Tr.
62-64) Previously,  he worked  for other employers in  various  jobs while  he  was  still on
active  military  duty.  (GEs  1-2)  He  held  a  security  clearance  while  he  was  in  the  Air
Force and is currently sponsored by his employer for a security clearance.  (GE 1; Tr.
63)
Applicant’s finances
Following his active-duty discharge from the Air Force in January 2016, Applicant
struggled  to  keep  up  with  his  financial  responsibilities  due  to  the  reduced  income  he
was  earning  from  his  post-military  job  and  his  loss  of  housing,  insurance,  and  food
expense  coverage.  (GE  2)  Credit  records  document  that  he accumulated  in  excess  of
$46,000 in consumer debts, in addition to accruing two medical debts exceeding $500
before  his  military  separation  in  January  2016.  (GEs  2-4)  At  the  time  of  his  military
discharge, Applicant estimates he was making around $50,000 a year, in addition to his
receipt of valuable housing and other living expenses.
Citing  a  pre-military  discharge  insurance  policy  to  cover  many  of  his  pre-
discharge debts while he sought post-discharge employment, Applicant could not obtain
a copy of his insurance policy from the identified carrier, who is no longer in business.
(AEs  B-C;  Tr.  43-45).  Nor  was  he  able  to  provide  information  on  the  specific  lines  of
loans and debts the insurance was designed to cover. (Tr. 58)
Following the hearing, Applicant was able to locate a copy of a letter covering his
2016 application for debtor’s insurance to meet his payment obligations to SOR creditor
¶ 1.b. (AE M) Without a copy of the policy itself, however, terms and conditions of the
policy  cannot  be  identified  and  validated.  Because  this  insurance  carrier  never
reportedly covered any of Applicant’s pre-discharge debts before going out of business
(AE  M),  inferences  can  be  drawn  of  policy  payment  restrictions  and  limitations  on
payouts  to  any  of  Applicant’s  pre-discharge  creditors.  Before  his  military  discharge,
Applicant  obtained  other  insurance  policies  as  well  to  cover  other  debts  that  might
emerge following his anticipated military separation. See GE 2; Tr. 58)
To  help  him  repair  his  credit  and  establish  a  budget  for  addressing  his  existing
and future debts, Applicant retained a credit-repair firm in January 2022. (AE B) Terms
of  his  agreement  with  the  credit-repair  firm  called  for  the  credit  repair  firm  to  analyze
Applicant’s  debts  and  assist  him  in  his  ensuring  that  his  credit  reports  fairly  and
accurately  reflected  his  credit  history.  (AE  C)  The  credit  repair  firm’s  responsibilities
included  helping  Applicant  with  repayment  plans  and  consolidating  his  debts  where
warranted.  (AE  C)  Applicant’s  repair  credit  agreement  limits  the  repair
firm’s
responsibilities  to  fulfilling  its  best  efforts  and  includes  no  assumed  responsibility  to
ensure any specific outcomes. (AEs E-F and I; Tr. 34-36, 44-46)
SOR  creditors  affected   by   Applicant’s  repair  firm’s  efforts   are   comprised   of  the
following: SOR ¶¶  1.a  ($136), 1.b  ($6,727), 1.c ($594), 1.d  ($2,558),  1.e  ($19,078), 1.f
($9,640), 1.g  ($2,495),  1.h  ($809), 1.i ($2,309), 1.j ($1,388), 1.k ($954), 1.l ($873), and
1.m  ($412).  (AEs D-F; Tr. 30-34) Debts that have  since  been  paid and  resolved  are as
follows:  SOR ¶¶  1.a  ($136); 1.d  ($2,558), and  1.e  ($19,078).  (AEs G and  K-M; Tr. 30-
34)  Together,  these  credited  debt payments exceed  $21,000  in  the  aggregate  and  are
favorably resolved.
Challenged debts that Applicant does  not consider to  belong  to  him Include: SOR
creditors ¶¶  1.b  ($6,727), 1.f  ($9,640),  1.g  ($2,495), 1.h  ($809),  1.i  ($2,309),1.j  ($1,388),
1.k  ($954),  1.l  ($873),   and   1.m   ($412).  (Tr.   49-58)  Together,  these   challenged   debts
exceed  $25,000.  Documenting  the  creditor SOR ¶  1.f  firm’s being   cited  by  the  Federal
Deposit  Insurance   corporation   (FDIC)   for  faulty   business  practices  involving   debt
consolidation   coverage   in  May   2017,  Applicant   stressed   that  he   paid  an   additional
$1,163  for debt cancellation  insurance  in  2015. (AE  N)  Terms  of his  insurance  contract
included  coverage  for debts incurred  prior to  his military  discharge. (AE  N)  Reportedly,
his  SOR  ¶   1.f   creditor  never  honored   its   insurance   contract  with   Applicant  and   later
charged off the  full amount of  the remaining $9,640 debt (inclusive of  accrued interest)
Based  on  the  FDIC’s  ordered  restitution  of  debts  owed  aggrieved  customers  of
SOR  ¶  1.f,  the  creditor’s  ensuing  charge-off  of  Applicant’s  debt  is  inferred  to  be
consistent  with  the  creditor’s  compliance  with  the  FDIC’s  ordered  restitution,  and  the
charge-off does not appear to be based on the simple passage of time. (SOR ¶ 1.f). (AE
N; Tr. 56-58) Favorable resolution of the debt covered by SOR ¶ 1.f is warranted.
Applicant’s disputes of the remaining debts covered by the SOR are based on his
claims that they were covered by his insurance policy, and should have been paid. Even
if  his  claims  are  based  on  faulty  understandings  of  the  breadth  and  scope  of  his
insurance policy’s coverage, his stated impressions appear to be the result of good-faith
mistaken  understandings  of  his  insurance  policy’s  terms  and  conditions,  and  were  not
motivated in any way by attempts to evade payment responsibility. (AE N; Tr. 56)
Applicant  currently  earns  $80,000  annually,  a  figure  that  has  not  appreciably
changed  since  his  start  date  in  2016.  (Tr.  67)  Once  his  disputed  debts  are  resolved
(either favorably or unfavorably), he will work with a debt management group to pay off
his remaining validated debts. (Tr. 62-65) He continues to claim that debts covered by
his  debtors’  insurance  policy  should  have  been  paid  by  the  administering  insurance
carrier. (Tr.  66)
