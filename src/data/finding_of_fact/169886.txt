Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  49  years  old.  He  attended  college,  but  did  not  earn  a  degree.  He
served in the Air Force Reserve from 1991 to 1999 and received an honorable discharge.
He married in 1994 and divorced in 1999. He has two grown children from the marriage.
He remarried in 2018 and has a stepson who is 22 and who resides with him and his wife.
(Transcript (Tr.)  21-28; GE 1)
Applicant   has  worked   for  his  current  employer,  a   federal  contractor,   since   June
2018. He  was unemployed  for two  months  from  April to  June  2018. Prior to  then,  Applicant
worked  for different federal contractors. He  was working  overseas at different times,  but
would periodically  return to  the  U.S. for training  or other requirements.  He disclosed,  on
his April 2019 security  clearance application (SCA), a  period of unemployment from May
2014  to  October 2014.  He testified  that from  2006  to  2012  he  worked  overseas. (Tr. 21-
28, 33-40, 45-49; GE  1)
In 2005, Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He explained that he fell behind on
paying his bills. He had been working full time for the Post Office and was transferred to
a new location and was only working part time. It is unknown the year he was transferred.
He resumed full-time employment in 2002 or 2003. In Applicant’s bankruptcy document,
under Schedule E, Creditors Holding Unsecured Priority Claims, the IRS ($12,000) and
his state tax authority ($3,472) are listed. He listed under Schedule F, Creditors Holding
Unsecured Nonpriority Claims, a total of $21,932. (Tr. 29-33; GE 5)
Applicant disclosed in his SCA that he failed to timely file and pay his 2014  and
2017 federal and state income tax returns. He estimated he owed approximately $3,500
for each year. He stated: “In the process of filing and if necessary setting up a payment
plan.” (GE 1) He also disclosed he had an unpaid phone bill from 2012 for $80 that he
would pay. He said he was refinancing his home and would pay the amount in full in April
2019. He disclosed a telecommunication bill from 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.f-$295); a cable bill in
collection from 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.g-$173); and a credit-card collection-account from 2014
(SOR ¶ 1.a- $2,237). He stated: “Fell behind during a period of unemployment and have
been  assisting  with  the  finances  of  my  now  current  wife.  Also,  attempted  to  launch  a
business which failed, due to this issue.” (GE 1, 3, 4, 6)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator on June 6, 2019. He told
the  investigator  that  he  had  recently  in  the  past  week  filed  his  2014,  2015  and  2017
delinquent tax returns. He said he owed approximately $25,000 in federal income taxes
and was current on his state income taxes. He intended on setting up a  payment plan
with  the  IRS  to  resolve  his  delinquent  taxes  and  was  waiting  for  his  tax  returns  to  be
processed. He explained he failed to timely file his tax returns because he knew he did
not have the money to pay what he owed. He reiterated this explanation at his hearing.
He said he failed to disclose all of this information on his SCA because he did not think
about it when he was completing the questionnaire. (Tr. 61-64, 118; GE 2).
During   the   interview,  Applicant  confirmed   the   bill  to   the   cable   company   was
because  he  failed  to  pay  the  final  bill  (SOR  ¶ 1.g).  In  January  2021,  Applicant paid  the
amount   owed.  Regarding   the   telecommunication   bill,  he   acknowledged   he   owed   the
amount  because  he  terminated  his contract  (SOR ¶ 1.f).  He had  not  paid the  final  balance,
which  was  owed   since   2014,   because   he   did  not  have   the   money.  At  the   time   of   the
interview, he had made no  effort to pay the account. In January 2021, Applicant paid the
amount  owed.  Applicant  had   also  not  been   able  to   pay   the   delinquent  credit  card
collection  account  and  had  not  made  any  effort to  do  so  at that  point.  This debt had  been
delinquent  since  2015.  (SOR ¶ 1.a). At his hearing, he  provided  documents to  show  in
January   2021,   he   reached   a   settlement   with   the   creditor  in   SOR   ¶   1.a.   He  paid   the
settlement and  received  an  IRS  cancelation  of  debt FORM  1099C  for $671  for tax  year
2020. He was asked if  he  filed this with his tax return  and he responded “no.” He said he
did not know  he  had  to  file  this form  with  his tax  return. (Tr. 49-50, 91-94,  96-98, 100,102-
103; GE 2; AE C, D, J, K)
The  government  investigator  confronted  Applicant  with  additional  delinquent
debts. He acknowledged owing the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($3,200) with a past-due balance
at the time of $800. This debt was for a personal loan he obtained in 2015 to help pay for
necessities. He made payments for a period and then in 2016 he was unable to continue
making  payments.  He  made  no  further  effort  to  resolve  it  until  approximately  January
2021, when he researched the debt and learned the company was no longer in business.
Applicant provided documents to show he cannot pay the debt due to the company going
out of business. (Tr. 96, 100-102; AE H)
During Applicant’s interview he acknowledged the charged-off credit card debt in
SOR ¶ 1.c ($896). It became delinquent in 2015. He paid the debt in January 2021. The
debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($1,792) is a credit card collection account. Applicant used this card
for a business he was going to start, but did not follow through. He had not made an effort
to repay the debt at the time of his interview. He settled the debt in April 2021. The debt
in SOR ¶ 1. d ($134) was for an unpaid utility bill from 2015. He paid it in January 2021.
He explained he was working on his financial situation which was due to unemployment
when he returned from overseas, and he was also living beyond his means. He could not
sustain his lifestyle without the additional money he earned from being overseas. He said
he  is  prioritizing his financial  obligations  and  takes full responsibility for the  delinquent
accounts. He testified that he was attempting to pay as many delinquent debts as possible
quickly because of his security clearance issues. (Tr. 90, 98-100, 103-104; GE 2, 3, 4, 6;
AE E, F, G)
In  undated  government  interrogatories,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  owed  2015
state income taxes in the amount of $2,155. He said that when he returned from overseas
in early 2016, he unintentionally overlooked his 2015 state income taxes, but had set up
a payment plan. He also said that leading up to his current reinvestigation for a security
clearance he started to file his delinquent income tax returns and employed a Tax Relief
Service (TRS) to assist him. He provided a copy of the contract dated January 2020. (Tr.
67, 88-90; GE 2, AE L)
Applicant disclosed in government interrogatories that his 2014 federal tax return
was filed in July 2019 and he owed $4,694; 2015 federal tax return was filed in August
2019 and he owed $4,753; 2016 federal tax return was filed in November 2017 and he
owed $16.85; 2017 federal tax return was filed in July 2019 and he owed $12,158; 2018
federal tax return was filed in Jun 2019 and he owed $4,593; and 2020 federal income
tax return was filed in October 2021 and he owed $8,296. At that time, he was not in a
payment  plan  with  the  IRS,  but  TRS  was  negotiating  with  the  IRS  on  his  behalf.  He
intended  to  amend  possibly  his  2016  and  2018  tax  returns  because  he  was  living
overseas and might be entitled to a foreign exemption. It is noted he told the government
investigator during his June 6, 2019 interview that he had already filed his 2014, 2015
and 2017 federal income tax returns. It is unknown if Applicant would have received an
automatic extension for filing because he was overseas. (Tr. 64-65, 70; GE 2)
Applicant also listed in the interrogatories the years he filed and status of the state
income taxes he owed. His 2014 return was filed in June 2019 and he owed nothing; tax
year 2015 was filed in June 2019 and he owed $2,155; tax year 2016 was filed in October
2017 and owed nothing; tax year 2018 was filed on time and no taxes were owed; 2019
was filed in October 2020, and no taxes were owed. He provided a letter from January
2021 from his state tax authority, which indicated he was in compliance and had no tax
liabilities. It is unknown when he paid the delinquent taxes. (GE 2; AE Q)
Applicant provided a November 2021 IRS installment agreement statement from
September  2020  to  September  2021  that  shows  he  made  a  payment  in  June  2021  of
$188 that was applied to tax year 2019; a payment of $295 in June 2021 applied to tax
year 2013; and a July 2021 payment of $295 applied to tax year 2019. (Tr. 77-79; AE O)
The November 2021 IRS document also reflected the current tax years’ balances
owed  by  Applicant.  They  were:  tax  year  2013-$1,386;  tax  year  2014-$4,814;  tax  year
2015-$4,873; tax year 2017-$18,109; tax year 2018-$4,159; and tax year 2019-$9,096.
The total amount owed at that time was $42,439. Included with this document, Applicant
provided an IRS 2020 W-4 to show he was having $50 extra withheld from his income.
(AE N)
Post-hearing, Applicant provided a copy of his IRS tax transcript for tax year 2020
showing he had timely filed his 2020 federal income tax return and did not owe taxes. His
tax transcript for tax year 2019 showed he filed in October 2020 and owed $9,456.  His
2018 tax transcript showed he filed on time and owed $3,886. (AE V, W, X)
Applicant  provided  a  copy  of  a  February  14,  2022,  email  to  him  from  TRS  that
indicated his 2017 federal tax return was completed and he was due a refund of $1,129.
However, it also indicated he may not receive a refund if he filed three years after the tax
return  was  due.  He  provided  a  partial  copy  of  an  amended  2017  tax  return  indicating
“amended return to exclude the taxpayer’s foreign income and add form 2555.” (AE Y) I
find in Applicant’s favor on SOR ¶ 1.j that alleged delinquent taxes for 2017.
Applicant  provided  an  IRS  FORM  433-D  Installment  Agreement  that  is  dated
January 17, 2021. In it, he agrees to pay $350 a month beginning in December 2020,
which would increase to $790 a month in December 2021. Applicant indicated that this
agreement did not take effect because TRS negotiated an agreement for a lesser amount.
He provided documents from TRS that confirmed an Installment Agreement for $295 a
month  to  begin  in  May  2021  for  one  year  and  then  $650  beginning  in  May  2022.  He
provided  documents  from  TRS  that  show  he  was  in  compliance  with  the  installment
agreement.  He  testified  that  prior  to  contracting  with  TRS  he  had  not  made  payments
towards  his  federal  tax  debts.  He  further  explained  that  the  installment  agreement
includes tax years 2013 through 2019. (Tr. 70-85; AE M, O, Z, BB)
Applicant  testified  that  he  rented  his  house  from  2006  to  2009  and  it  sustained
damage. He attempted to repair it when he was back in the United States, but was never
home long enough. He planned to refinance the home and use the equity to repay his
debts.  He  testified  that  in  early  January  2022,  he  started  the  process  to  refinance  his
home.  He  provided  an  email  from  February  10,  2022,  indicating  the  refinancing  was
approved. (Tr. 50-53; AE AA)
After the record closed, Applicant provided additional documents that I accepted.
He provided a copy of his IRS tax year 2021 transcript that shows he has filed his 2021
tax return and is due a refund, which he stated will be applied to his tax debt. In addition,
he provided a transcript for payments that were being processed by the IRS for tax years
2019 and 2018 through a direct deposit made on February 25, 2022, for presumably the
current balances owed ($9,454 and $2,521, respectively). Also being processed through
an online account were payments made on February 24, 2022, for tax years 2015 and
2014  ($4,938  and  $4,878  respectively).  Presumably,  he  obtained  the  funds  from  the
equity secured from refinancing his house. (AE P, AA, CC, DD, EE)
Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered
for disqualifying purposes. It may be considered when making a credibility determination,
in applying mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis.
Applicant attributed his financial problems to his 2014 unemployment; depletion of
his savings; accepting a new job at a significantly reduced income; and helping his brother
who came to live with him. In addition, he believed he was entitled to a foreign exemption
for different tax years when he was overseas. He anticipated receiving the exemption, but
when he unexpectedly returned to the United States it negated the exemption, thereby
causing him to have a tax bill he had not expected. He believed certain tax years qualified
for the exemption. In addition, when he was in the United States, he was not eligible to
earn overseas pay, which was substantially more. (Tr. 33-49; AE A)
Applicant testified that his 2018 wedding cost between $10,000 and $15,000, and
he funded about half of it. In 2017, he purchased a $7,000 wedding ring for his wife. When
asked why he made these purchases before addressing his delinquent taxes, he said he
should have prioritized better. He traveled to the Bahamas in 2012 and Jamaica in 2017
for tourism. He currently earns about $90,000 annually and his wife earns about $60,000.
He has no pension plan and minimal savings. (Tr. 46, 104-105, 107; GE 1)
Applicant  provided  character  letters  from  family  and  coworkers.  In  them,  he  is
described  as  professional,  trustworthy,  respectful,  self-motivated,  disciplined,  reliable,
ethical, honest, friendly, efficient, detailed-oriented and competent. He has exceptional
skills  and  good  judgment.  His  2020  and  2021  performance  assessments  rate  his
performance as “exceptional” and “strong.” He provided certificates of appreciation from
2011, 2012 and 2013. (AE R, S, T)
