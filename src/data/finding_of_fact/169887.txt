In her Answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.d, 1.g – 1.j, 1.l – 1.v, and 1.x.
Applicant denied SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.k, and 1.w. She also provided brief explanations for
the  SOR  allegations,  and  a  longer  narrative  statement  about  her  financial  problems.
Applicant’s  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and
careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional
findings of fact.
Applicant is 52 years old. She has been employed as a security specialist since
1991,  and  has  worked  for  her  current  employer  since  2013.  She  has  held  a  security
clearance since 1991, and it was last renewed in 2016. She earned a bachelor’s degree
in 2017. She has been married since 2004, and has three adult children. (Item 2)
Applicant  stated  that  her  financial  problems  are  due  to  reasons  beyond  her
control,  including  medical  issues  that  have  required  treatment  and  short  term  medical
leave from work. Her spouse also had medical issues and disabilities, which impacted
his  employability.  Her  adult  daughter  and  two  grandchildren  live  in  Applicant’s  home.
Her  daughter  and  grandchild  were  severely  injured  in  a  car  accident  in  2019,  which
created a personal and financial strain on the family. (Items 1, 2, 3)
In  her  Answer,  Applicant  stated  that  she  has  been  trying  to  resolve  her
outstanding debts by contacting her creditors, and making payment arrangements that
fit  within  her  budget.  She  also  disputed  debts  that  she  believes  are  reported  in  error.
She stated that she is committed to continue resolving outstanding debts, and improving
her financial situation. (Item 1)
In her February 2020 interview, Applicant provided information about her monthly
budget to the government investigator. It showed  she had approximately $275 monthly
that  she  could  apply  to  debt  payments,  beyond  the  debt  payments  she  was  already
making.  Applicant  did  not  provide  evidence  that  she  has  received  credit  counseling.
(Item 3)
The SOR alleges 24 delinquent debts, totaling about $61,000. About $50,000 of
the debt  resulted  from Applicant’s  student  loans.  Applicant  also  has  seven  small past-
due medical debts and nine past-due consumer and utility accounts. The allegations are
established by Applicant’s admissions, and the four credit reports in the record: October
10,  2019  (Item  4);  January  24,  2020  (Item  5);  September  6,  2020  (Item  6),  and
November 10, 2021 (Item 7). The status of the debts are as follows:
SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.c,  1.g,  1.h,  1.i,  1.j,  and  1.x  are  medical  debts  totaling  $755.
Applicant  contacted  the  creditor  and  consolidated  these  debts  into  one  combined  bill.
She is making payments as she is able, and contested some of the debts as duplicates.
She provided documentation showing that the combined balance of the debts has been
reduced to about $595. (Item 1; AE A)
SOR ¶¶ 1.m – 1.t are delinquent student loans totaling $50,190. In her SCA, she
stated  that  her  student  loans  became  delinquent  because  of  the  loss  of  her  spouse’s
income, and a medical condition that required her to be on short-term medical leave for
two months. Applicant reached out to the creditors, and made a payment arrangement
with  them,  to  bring  the  accounts  current.  Her  two  most  recent  credit  reports  in  the
record,  September  2020,  and  November  2021,  show  all  eight  of  her  student  loan
accounts  as  current,  with  no  amount  past  due.  These  credit  reports  also  report  the
status of each account as “pays as agreed”. (Items 1, 2, 5, 7)
SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.l  are  duplicated  allegations  for  the  same  past-due  debt  of
$376.  One  is  owed  to  the  original  creditor,  and  the  other  is  owed  to  a  subsequent
collection agency. Applicant reached out to the creditor to verify the debt, but has been
unable  to  get  documentation from the creditor to  make  payment arrangements.  (Items
1, 6, 7) SOR ¶ 1.l is resolved for Applicant as a duplicate.
SOR ¶ 1.d is a $139 debt in collection to an insurance company. In her Answer,
Applicant states that she spoke to the creditor to make arrangements, but they could not
find the account in their records. (Items 1, 6, 7)
SOR  ¶  1.e  is  a  $137  charged-off  debt  for  home  furnishings.  Applicant
documented that the debt has been paid. (Items 1, 6; AE B)
SOR ¶ 1.f is a $117 debt in collection to an insurance company. In her Answer,
Applicant states that the debt is now paid, and that this creditor is her current insurance
provider. However, no documentation was provided. (Items 1, 6, 7)
SOR  ¶  1.k  concerns  an  auto  repossession,  and  a  charged  off  debt  of  $8,188.
Applicant leased a vehicle in early 2018. She missed a payment in mid-2019, because
her husband had lost his job due to medical issues. The lender told her that she had to
pay  the  remaining  balance  in  full,  or  turn  in  the  vehicle.  She  was  unable  to  pay  the
balance  in  full,  and  opted  to  return  the  car.  She  asserts  that  the  account  was  closed
when  the  vehicle  was  turned  in,  and  she  owes  them  nothing,  however,  she  did  not
provide any documentation to corroborate her claim. (Items 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
SOR  ¶  1.u  is  a  credit  account  that  was  charged  off  in  the  amount  of  $661.
Applicant  asserts  that  this  debt  was  a  loan  she  obtained  while  out  of  work  due  to  a
medical condition. Her spouse was also out of work at that time. Applicant contacted the
creditor, and she was told that they could no longer locate the account in their records.
The  debt  appeared  as  a  charge  off  on  her  October  2019  and  January  2020  credit
reports. However, the September 2020 and November 2021 credit reports show a zero
balance. (Items 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
SOR ¶ 1.v is a debt in collection to an insurance company in the amount of $176.
Applicant  asserts  that  she  contacted  the  creditor  several  times  to  settle  this  account,
and  they have  repeatedly failed  to provide her  with  the  necessary  paperwork to  repay
the debt. (Items 1, 3, 5)
SOR  ¶  1.w  is  a  debt  in  collection  to  a  phone  company  in  the  amount  of  $72.
Applicant denies this debt and has disputed it. She states that the creditor told her that
they no longer possessed this account. (Items 1, 2, 3, 5)
