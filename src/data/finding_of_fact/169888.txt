Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  problems,  including  defaulted  student  loans,
bankruptcies, unpaid state and federal income taxes, and delinquent debts. His student-
loan  issues  go  back  to  after  he  left  college,  and  his  tax  issues  go  back  to  2002.  He
attributed  his  financial  problems  to  periods  of  unemployment  and  assisting  his  family
financially. (Tr. at 22-23, 29-31; Tr.2 at 17; GE 1)
Applicant  attended  one  college for a  period, which  he financed  at least  partially
through student loans. He earned a scholarship to another college where he was an All
American  athlete.  He  went  to  the  Olympic  Trials  in  1992  and  1996.  He  received  a
master’s  degree  while  coaching  at  his  undergraduate  college.  He  continued  to  coach
high school athletes, and he helped high school athletes prepare for college and receive
scholarships. (Tr. at 15-21, 27, 33; AE A)
Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in January 2013. Under Schedule D,
Creditors  Holding  Secured  Claims,  the  petition  listed  a  $20,234  auto  loan.  Under
Schedule E, Creditors Holding Unsecured Priority Claims, the petition listed $49,132 in
federal income taxes, penalties, and interest for tax years 2009, 2010, and 2011. Under
Schedule F, Creditors Holding Unsecured Nonpriority Claims, the petition listed claims
totaling $155,269. The claims included $77,942 in federal income taxes, penalties, and
interest  for  tax  years  2003  through  2008.  The  petition  listed  $5,261  in  state  income
taxes,  penalties,  and  interest  for  tax  year  2009,  and  it  listed  $14,061  owed  on  a
guaranteed student loan. (Tr. at 21-24; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 6; AE H)
Applicants dischargeable debts were discharged  in May  2013. The  order stated:
“SEE   THE  BACK   OF  THIS   ORDER  FOR  IMPORTANT   INFORMATION.”  The   back  of
the  order provided additional information, including the  following:
Debts That are Not Discharged
Some   of  the   common   types  of   debts  which  are  not  discharged   in   a
chapter 7  bankruptcy case are:
a. Debts for most taxes;
d. Debts for most student loans. (GE 6)
Applicant filed a  Chapter 13  bankruptcy case  in  June 2014.  Under Schedule  E,
Creditors Holding Unsecured Priority Claims, the petition listed $9,395 in federal income
taxes  for  tax  years  2012  and  2013,  and  $8,546  in  state  income  taxes  for  the  same
years. Under Schedule F, Creditors Holding Unsecured Nonpriority Claims, the petition
listed $25,131 in federal income taxes for tax years 2009, 2010, and 2011, and $6,009
in state income taxes for 2011. The case was dismissed in August 2017. (Tr. at 24-26;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5; AE H)
Applicant defaulted on his student loans. The September 2019 credit report lists
a student loan in collections, owed to the U.S. Department of Education, with a balance
of  $41,752.  The  July  2020  credit  report  listed  that  the  balance  had  increased  to
$42,660.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  not  made  any  payments  for  about  20  years
until  he  entered  into  a  loan  rehabilitation  program  in  February  2021  to  make  nine
monthly payments of $49. The Department of Education confirmed in October 2021 that
Applicant made the required payments, and his loan was rehabilitated and back in good
standing. (Tr. at 27-35; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE B, H)
Applicant settled  the  $1,738  debt in  SOR  ¶ 1.d  for $950  in  September 2021. He
paid the  $920  debt in  SOR ¶ 1.e  in  September 2021. He received  financial counseling
from  a  federal agency, and  he  received  financial advice from  a  college  friend.  (Tr.  at  29-
32, 36-37; GE  3, 4; AE C, D, F-H)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
August  2019.  He  reported  both  bankruptcies.  For  the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy,  he
checked  the  box  indicating  that  he  was  discharged  of  all  debts  claimed  in  the
bankruptcy.  He  explained  that  “Consolidation  in  progress,”  including  state  tax  liens  of
$4,627, filed on September 13, 2013, and $5,977, filed on October 24, 2012. (GE 1)
Applicant did not report his defaulted student loans on the SF 86 under any of the
financial questions. He initially testified that he did not report his student loans because
he  thought  they  were  in  deferment.  He  stated  that  he  called  the  student  loan  provider
when he was out of work and asked if his loans could be deferred until he found a  job.
When he was asked why after 20 years of no payments, he would call the provider and
ask for a deferment, he changed his story to he did not call the student loan provider for
a deferment, he called the credit card companies. He stated that he did not  report the
student  loans  on  the  SF  86  because  he  thought  they  had  been  discharged  in
bankruptcy. (Tr. at 29, 32-33, 39-44; GE 1)
Applicant did not report his delinquent federal income taxes  on the SF 86 under
any  of  the  financial  questions,  including  questions  that  asked:  “In  the  last  seven  (7)
years have you failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law
or ordinance?” and if: “You are currently delinquent on any Federal debt.”
Applicant submitted a personal financial statement at his hearing that reported a
monthly remainder of $3,639 after deductions, liabilities, and expenses were deducted
from  his  gross  income.  It  did  not  include  any  deductions  for  federal  and  state  income
taxes. When asked if he owed any federal and state income taxes, he asserted that he
was paying his state about $500 per month toward a debt of $40,000 to $45,000. (Tr. at
44-46, 50; AE E) As to the IRS, he was asked:
AJ: And how much do you owe the IRS?
Applicant: It’s - - right now currently I don’t owe the IRS.
AJ: You don’t owe the IRS?
Applicant: Right now, currently I don’t. (Tr. at 46-47)
When pressed, Applicant admitted that he probably owed the IRS about $50,000
to $70,000, including about $10,000 for 2020. (Tr. at 47-50) At the reconvened hearing,
he was evasive and never gave an actual amount that he owed the IRS, but estimated a
figure of $100,000. (Tr.2 at 9-14, 21-22)
In  January  2022,  Applicant  contracted  with  a  tax  attorney  to  represent  his
interests with the IRS. He agreed to pay the attorney $11,273 for his fees, payable in 17
monthly  payments  of  $626,  through  May  2023.  Applicant’s  2013  bankruptcy  petition
reported  that  he  owed  $127,074  to  the  IRS  for  taxes  owed  through  2011.  His  2014
bankruptcy  petition  reported  that  he  owed  the  IRS  an  additional  $9,395  for  tax  years
2012  and  2013.  That  adds  up  to  $136,469  owed  to  the  IRS  in  2014,  and  it  does  not
include additional penalties and interest or the amounts owed for tax years after 2013.
Absent any documented proof from Applicant, his testimony that he owes the IRS about
$100,000 is not credible. (Tr.2 at 9-14, 21-22; GE 5, 6; AE I, K)
On October 26, 2021, Applicant entered into a payment agreement with his state
to  pay  $500  per  month  toward  his  income  tax  debt  of  $124,998  for  tax  years  2002,
2003,  2005  to  2011,  2013  to  2016,  2019,  and  2020.  He  paid  the  state  $1,537,  which
included a $37 service fee, by credit card on October 1, 2021. (Tr.2 at 7-9, 13; AE J, N)
Applicant  denied  intentionally  providing  false  information  on  the  SF  86.  He
always filed his tax returns, but he did not always pay what was owed. He testified that
since  the  question  asked  “have  you  failed  to  file  and/or  pay  Federal,  state,  or  other
taxes”  (language  in  bold  is  not  in  the  SF  86  question),  he  only  had  to  answer  the
question affirmatively if he did not file and did not pay. His answer remained the same
after he was told that the question in the SF 86 was not an “and/or” question; it was just
an “or” question. He provided a similar response to why he answered the question that
asked if “You are currently delinquent on any Federal debt.” Applicant was diagnosed in
2003 with a learning disability, and specifically, a reading disorder. With concessions for
his learning disability, he worked as a teacher and a coach from 2002 to 2007. His post-
hearing  submissions  included  treatises  on  the  ambiguity  of  “and”  and  “or”  in  legal
drafting. (Tr. at 51-52; Tr.2 at 11-12, 15-21; GE 1; AE L, M, O)
Applicant  volunteers  in  his  community.  He  submitted  documents  and  letters
attesting  to  his  moral  character  and  excellent  job  performance.  He  is  praised  for  his
trustworthiness,  honesty,  dedication,  humility,  kindness,  judgment,  work  ethic,  and
integrity. (AE A)
