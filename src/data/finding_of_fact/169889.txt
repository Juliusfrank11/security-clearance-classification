In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c,
and  denied  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.d.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 62 years old. He served in the United States Marine Corps from 1977
to 1982, and served in the United States Air Force from 1982 to 2003, and reports he was
honorably discharged. Applicant has been married since 2005, he was previously married
from  1981  to  1999.  He  has  six  children  (ages  31,  26,  15,  13,  and  twins  who  are  11).
Applicant has worked as a facility protection manager for the same employer since 2010.
(Item 3)
The  SOR  alleges  four  delinquent  accounts  totaling  approximately  $49,113
including  a  mortgage  foreclosure  with  a  deficiency  balance  placed  for  collection
($13,699),  two  charged  off  credit  cards  ($35,293),  and  one  credit  account  placed  for
collection ($121). (Item 1)
Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in February 2020. He
reported a single financial issue, the foreclosure on an investment property estimated at
$200,000, that commenced in January 2016, and was resolved in January 2018. (Item 3)
Applicant was interviewed  by government  investigators on various dates in May
and June 2020. During the May 2020 interview, he explained the foreclosure was a rental
property he owned after suffering financial distress when renters left the home after the
property  was  damaged  by  flooding  from  a  broken  hot  water  heater.  Applicant  said  he
could not afford to repair the property damage and  that after he was unable to sell the
property the bank foreclosed on, and sold the property in January 2018. He claimed the
account was settled in full. Applicant also acknowledged that he had been delinquent on
the  debts  alleged  at  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  and  1.c,  but  reported  settling  those  debts  in  full  in
approximately  2017,  after  completing  a  30-month  payment  plan.  Applicant  attributed
those debts to  living expenses  while  addressing foreclosure on his  rental property.  He
acknowledged the delinquent debt alleged at SOR ¶ 1.d, but said he was disputing the
debt with the creditor. (Item 4)
Credit records dated April 10, 2020, November 13, 2020 and November 1, 2021
reflect the four delinquent accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.d totaling  $49,113 and
foreclosure ($273,010) on  one  of  Applicant’s  two  mortgages. These records report the
last payment on the delinquent accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, and 1.c as September
2015.  These  credit  records  also  reflect  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  as  an  apparent
deficiency balance of a mortgage account opened in April 2013, that went into foreclosure
in 2018 and closed in March 2019. The deficiency balance of the mortgage was placed
for  collection  in  September 2018  and  the  records  do  not  reflect  any  payments  on  that
deficiency balance. (Items 5, 6, 7)
In  his  undated  Response  to  the  FORM,  Applicant  asserted  several  delinquent
accounts were removed from his recent credit reports and that only one delinquent debt
remained.  He  submitted  two  credit  reports  dated  December  6,  2021  which  include  no
reference to the debts alleged at SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d. Both credit reports reflect the
delinquent debt alleged at SOR ¶ 1.b as placed for collection in September 2018 in the
amount  alleged  in  the  SOR  and  no  other  delinquencies.  One  of  the  reports  reflects
Applicant’s mortgage opened in April 2013  with regular payments through March 2018,
delinquent starting in April 2018, and foreclosure in March 2019. Applicant did not report
resolving  the  delinquent  accounts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.c  and  provided  no
documentary evidence of payments on any debt alleged in the SOR. (AE A, AE B, AE C)
Applicant  has  provided  inconsistent  and  contradictory  responses  regarding
whether the delinquent debts alleged at SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c have been resolved.
He reported no delinquent accounts in his SCA, claimed the debts alleged at SOR ¶¶ 1.a
and 1.c were resolved in approximately 2017, and denied owing the debt alleged at SOR
¶  1.b  during  background  interviews,  but  in  response  to  the  SOR  he  admitted  all  three
debts remained delinquent in the amounts alleged. (Items 2, 3, 4)
Applicant  claimed  he  disputed  the  delinquent  account  alleged  at  SOR  ¶  1.d
because this account was a double billing for a fee that had been paid. His credit records
from April 2020 reflect Applicant disputed this account and credit records from November
2020,  November  2021,  and  December  2021  include  no  reference  to  this  account.
Although, Applicant failed to provide other documentary evidence, and this debt may have
fallen off his credit report for other reasons, I have given him credit for his corroborated
explanation that he disputed this debt and find in his favor on SOR ¶ 1.d. (Items 2, 4, 5,
6, 7, AE A, AE B, AE C)
Applicant did not provide specific evidence of his current financial budget, savings
or expendable income. Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will
not  be  considered  for  disqualifying  purposes.  However,  it  may  be  considered  in  the
application of mitigating conditions and in a whole-person analysis.
