In  Applicant’s SOR response, he  admitted  the  SOR allegations  in ¶¶  1.a  through

Financial Considerations
Applicant attributed his delinquent debts to his  divorce, and his decision to take
responsibility for the marital debts. (Tr. 19) He was underemployed and lacked sufficient
income  to  pay  his  debts.  (Tr.  19)  About  four  months  before  his  hearing,  he  sought
professional  help  from  a  financial  advisor  with  his  debts.  (Tr.  19)  From  July  through
August 2021, he was hospitalized on three occasions. (Tr. 20, 36-37) He was unable to
work for four months. (Tr. 35-36) He  has been  working part time as  a  translator since

receiving Social Security payments. (Tr. 55) He does not have any savings or retirement

SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.j allege that Applicant had 10 delinquent accounts totaling
$85,859 for the following amounts: $25,651; $24,161; $16,858; $5,545; $3,495; $2,851;
$2,517; $478; $335; and $3,968. (HE 2) For 4 of the 10 debts, the creditors attempted to
garnish Applicant’s pay; however, Applicant did not know the result of the lawsuits. (Tr.
38)
Applicant stopped paying the SOR debts in 2017, except for SOR ¶ 1.b ($24,161).
(Tr. 33, 48, 52) The debts were generated for living expenses at a time when Applicant
was unemployed. (Tr. 51-53) Due to lack of income, he did not make any payments on
the other SOR debts. (Tr. 37, 48-50) He sought professional help with his debts from a
financial advisor. (Tr. 34) His financial advisor is supposed to  contact his creditors and
discuss the debts with his creditors. (Tr. 36) He does not have a plan for resolving his
SOR debts. (Tr. 38) He has given information to his financial advisor; however, he has
not signed a contract with the financial advisor for services. (Tr. 50-51) He is relying on
the financial advisor for help and advice about what he should do about his debts.  (Tr.
38, 49) He has not received financial counseling. (Tr. 54)
As for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b for $24,161 for child support, Applicant explained that
he  provides  some  financial  support  to  his  family.  (Tr.  39-44)  He  has  receipts  for  the
payments he made to support his children. (Tr. 41) He purchased used cars for two of his

years to show his income. (Tr. 57-58) I requested that he provide documentation showing
his  history  of  making  child  support  payments,  and  documentation  concerning  his
agreement with the professional financial advisor. (Tr. 46-47, 60) He did not provide any
post-hearing documentation.
