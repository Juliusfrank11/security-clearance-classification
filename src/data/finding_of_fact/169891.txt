The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  12  past-due  debts  totaling  approximately
$41,000. The existence and amounts of these debts is supported by credit reports dated
May 19, 2020; November 24, 2020; and June 1, 2021. (Items 5, 6, and 7.) Applicant stated
that  most  of  his  financial  problems  were  connected  to  his  immaturity  and  “not  being
responsible  with  his  financial  situation.”  The  money  he  makes  in  his  current  job  has
allowed him to change his financial circumstances for the better and get a handle on his
finances. One way he did this was paying off the note on his car, which freed up money
for other debts. Applicant also stated his credit score has been improving as he has been
paying his debts off. Finally, Applicant is current on his child support obligations. (Item 2
at 4-5, 7-8, 10; Item 4 at 8; Applicant Exhibit A.)

arrangement with  the  credit union’s 3rd  party  collection  agency  to  make  monthly  payments
of   $200   to   pay   off   the   debt.   He  submitted   documentary   evidence   from  the   collection
agency that he  has been making consistent monthly  payments  for over a year  starting in
June 2020, before issuance of the SOR. These debts  are  being resolved.  (Item  2  at  4, 6,
