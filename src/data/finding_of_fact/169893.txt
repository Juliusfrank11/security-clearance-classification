In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.f, 2.a, 2.b,
2.c, and 2.d. (HE 3) He denied the other SOR allegations. He also provided extenuating
and mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 29-year-old  database  analyst  working  for a  defense  contractor. (Tr.
5, 36; GE  1) He orders repair  parts and  supplies using  a  computer. (Tr.  36) In  2010,  he
graduated  from  high  school, and  he  attended  college  for less than  one  semester. (Tr. 5-
6)  He served  in the  Navy  from 2010  to  2018. (Tr. 6, 17) When  he  was discharged  from
the  Navy, he  was a  petty  officer third  class  (E-4). (Tr. 7) His Navy  specialty  was logistics
specialist. (Tr. 6)  He was discharged  for serious misconduct,  and  he  received  a  general
discharge  under honorable  conditions.  (GE  7)  In  2011,  he  married,  and  in  2017,  he  was
divorced. (Tr. 8) His four children  are ages one, two, five, and eight.  (Tr. 8)
Financial Considerations
In January 2018, Applicant’s pay was reduced because of  a reduction in rank to
petty  officer  third  class  from  a  proceeding  under  Article  15,  Uniform  Code  of  Military
Justice  (UCMJ).  (Tr.  22)  He  was  unemployed  for  about  three  months  after  he  was
discharged from the Navy in March 2018. (Tr. 21) He was underemployed after leaving
the Navy. (Tr. 26)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c allege three charged-off debts owed to the same credit
union for $15,988, $10,459, and $4,252. SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e allege two charged-off debts
owed to a bank for $3,422 and $377. SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a medical debt in collection for
$461.
In March 2019, Applicant enrolled in a debt reduction program (DRP). (Tr. 26; SOR
response at 16) DRP told Applicant that they could settle his debts for 50 percent of the
face  amount  of  his debts.  (Tr. 27) He  made  the  agreed  upon  $524  monthly payments
under the DRP. (Tr. 28; SOR response at 17-64) He paid all of the SOR debts except the
debt in SOR ¶ 1.a for $16,588. (Tr. 29-33; AE A at 5) He anticipates the last debt will be
paid in 2022; however, it is unclear precisely when the debt will be paid under his payment
plan. (Tr. 33; AE A at 5) The DRP indicates the debt is $8,292, and it is in the process of
being paid. (Id.) A settlement agreement from the creditor was not provided.
Applicant  completed  a  personal  financial  statement  (PFS)  after  his  hearing
showing his monthly income was $4,120; his primary payment was monthly alimony of
$1,019;  and  his  monthly  net  remainder  was  $184.  (AE  A  at  1-3)  He  did  not  include  a
payment to DRP in his PFS. Based on his general confusion during the hearing, he may
not have understood how to properly complete the PFS.
Alcohol Consumption  and  Criminal Conduct
SOR ¶¶  2.a,  2.b, and  3.a  allege  that Applicant was arrested  in about December
2011  for  driving  while  intoxicated  (DWI)  and  underage  consumption  of  alcohol. (GE  2  at
5) His blood  alcohol  content (BAC)  from a breathalyzer test was .13.  (GE  2  at  5)  He was
found  guilty  of  DWI, and received  a suspended jail sentence with two years of probation,
and  a   $500   fine.  (Id.)  He  completed   a   two-day   Navy   Substance   Abuse   Rehabilitation
Program   (SARP)   alcohol-impact  class.   (Id.)   In   January   2012,   his   commanding   officer
imposed  nonjudicial punishment  (NJP) for  drunk driving, in violation  of Article 111, UCMJ,
for the  December 2011  DWI, and  he  was reduced  from  E-2  to  E-1, received  forfeitures of
half of one  month’s pay for two months, and restriction  for 45 days. (Id.)  See  Tr. 18.
SOR ¶¶ 2.c, 2.d, and 3.a allege Applicant was arrested in about October 2017 for
DWI, and reckless driving (speeding). His BAC was .11. (GE 6) He was convicted of DWI,
and his driver’s license was suspended for one year. (GE 1) The court sentenced him to
365  days  in  jail  (suspended  for  two  years),  and  he  received  a  $250  fine.  (GE  1)  His
commanding officer imposed NJP for the October 2017 drunk driving offense, in violation
of  Article  111,  UCMJ.  (GE  6)  In  November  2017,  his  commanding  officer  imposed  a
reduction from petty officer first class to petty officer second class and 30 days of extra
duty as well as forfeiture of one half of one month’s pay for two months (suspended). (GE
2 at 2) He received an alcohol evaluation from the Navy SARP, which determined he did
not need to attend alcohol-related classes, counseling, or treatment. (Id.) See Tr. 19-20.
Applicant rarely consumes alcohol, and when he does, he limits his consumption
to two drinks. (Tr. 23-25) He does not believe he has a problem with alcohol consumption.
(Tr. 25)
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 4.a alleges that in response to the question on his March 18, 2020 SCA
about the type of discharge he received, Applicant wrote “Honorable.” (GE 1 at 25) His
discharge was actually general under honorable conditions. Applicant was told he was
going  to  be  entitled  to  benefits  from  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA),  and  he
believed he was getting an honorable discharge. (Tr. 34) After reviewing his DD Form
214, he acknowledged it was a general discharge under honorable conditions. (Tr. 34)
He did not intend to deceive security officials with his answer on his SCA. (Tr. 34)
SOR ¶ 4.b alleges that on May 12, 2020, Applicant responded to questions from
an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator about his discharge. It alleged
that  he  falsely  stated  that  he  served  out  his  contract,  and  he  was  not  discharged  for
misconduct.  Actually,  Applicant  received  an  administrative  discharge  after  having  a
hearing. (Tr. 21) He said he misunderstood what the OPM investigator was asking him,
and he intended to accurately convey the processing of his discharge during the interview.
(Tr. 35)
SOR ¶ 4.c alleges that Applicant’s March 18, 2020 SCA asked whether he had
ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol, and he failed to disclosed his DWI
charges  in  2011  and  2017.  Applicant  disclosed  his  2017  DWI  arrest,  and  sentence  in
civilian  court  on  his  SCA.  (GE  1  at  38-39)  On  May  12,  2020,  Applicant  told  an  OPM
investigator that he failed to disclose his 2011 DWI charge on his SCA because he failed
to  carefully read  the  question,  and  he  believed  he  only had  to  disclose  charges  in  the
previous seven years. (GE 2 at 5). He did not intend to deceive anyone with his answers
about his DWIs. (Tr. 35)
Character Evidence
Applicant  received  the  following  Navy  ribbons  and  medals:  National  Defense
Service Medal; Navy  “E” Ribbon  (2); Navy  Good  Conduct Medal  (2); Inherent Resolve
Campaign Medal; Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; and Sea Service Deployment
Ribbon. (GE 7)
