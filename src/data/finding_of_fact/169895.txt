The  SOR  alleges  five  delinquent  accounts  including:  three  charged-off  credit
accounts for $10,542 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c); and two accounts in collection, totaling
around  $1,272  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.e).  In  his  answers  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted
SOR  ¶  1.a,  and  denied  all  of  the  remaining  SOR  allegations.  His  admission  is
incorporated  herein  in  my  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  review  of  the  record
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  50  years  old.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  1989,  and  shortly
thereafter enlisted in the U.S. Army. Apparently, he served about a year on active duty
and was then transferred to the Inactive Reserve where he served until 1997. He stated
that  he  received  an  honorable  discharge.  While  in  the  service,  Applicant  was  granted
eligibility for access to top-secret and sensitive compartmented information (SCI).
A  federal  contractor  hired  Applicant  in  2006,  and  he  has  been  working  for
subsequent  federal  contractors  to  present  as  a  contract  security  supervisor.  He  also
worked  part-time  for  another  federal  contractor  between  2009  and  2014.  He  was
granted eligibility for access to secret information in 2009 and to top-secret in 2011. His
access to classified information has been continued to present. His employment history
indicates no periods of unemployment or underemployment.  Applicant married his wife
in 2008. They have six children, ages 31, 30, 27, 15, 11, and 10. He previously married
in 1989 and became a widower in 1994.
All of the SOR debts are established by the credit reports in evidence, Applicant’s
SOR admission, and his statement to investigators during his March 4, 2020 interview.
(FORM, Items 6-8; Item 5) The status of the accounts alleged in the SOR follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a ($6,264) is a credit card account Applicant opened in 2010. He made
his  last  payment  on  the  account  in  about  2018,  and  after  many  collection  efforts,  the
creditor  charged-off  the  account.  Applicant  submitted  no  additional  information  on  this
account or any evidence of his intent (if any) to resolve this debt in the future.
SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($2,936); 1.c ($1,342); and 1.d ($733) alleged charged-off credit card
accounts  owed  to  the  same  credit  provider.  In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  denied  the
three  allegations.  However,  in  his  March  2020  statement,  he  admitted  having  some
accounts  with  the  provider  and  claimed  the  accounts  became  delinquent  because  he
had  to  provide  financial  help  to  his  parents  and  grandparents.  He  provided  no
documentary  evidence  to  corroborate  the  need  for  him  to  provide  financial  support  to
relatives,  the  period  when  the  support  was  provided,  or  the  extent  of  the  financial
support.
State  court  records  show  that  the  credit  provider  successfully  filed  at  least  two
collection actions against Applicant. In 2017, it filed a collection action for $3,580, and
obtained a consent judgment for $2,860 in January 2020. The judgment was satisfied in
September  2020.  (FORM,  Item  9)  Apparently,  some  of  Applicant’s  property  was
garnished to satisfy part of the judgment. (FORM, Item 9)
In December 2017, the creditor filed a collection action for $1,518, and obtained
a consent judgment for $1,288 in January 2020. A lien was recorded against Applicant
in October 2020, and a garnishment of wages was granted in May 2021. (FORM, Items
10  and  11)  Applicant  submitted  no  evidence  to  show  that  this  judgment  has  been
satisfied.
SOR  ¶  1.d  ($733)  alleged  an  account  in  collection  by  a  collection  company  on
behalf of the same credit provider alleged in  SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c. In his SOR answer,
Applicant  denied  the  allegation.  However,  in  his  March  2020  statement,  he  admitted
having  some accounts  with  the  provider and  claimed  the accounts  became  delinquent
because he had to provide financial help to his parents and grandparents. He provided
no documentary evidence to corroborate the financial support provided. The account is
established  by  the  record  evidence.  Applicant  submitted  no  evidence  to  show  that  the
account has been paid or otherwise resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.e  ($539)  alleged  a  medical  account  in  collection.  In  his  March  2020
statement,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  incurred  the  medical  expense  in  2014.  He
believed  his  insurance  would  have  paid  the  debt,  but  then  discovered  it  was  not  paid.
Applicant  submitted  no  evidence  of  his  efforts  to  contact  the  creditor  or  to  repay  the
debt.  He  disputed  this  debt,  and  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  1.c,  and  1.d  in
January 2020. He submitted no reasonable basis to justify the disputes.
Applicant  submitted  no  evidence  about  his  efforts  to  pay  his  debts,  or  of  any
contacts  with  his  creditors  to  establish  payment  arrangement.  He  presented  no
evidence  to  show  he has participated  in financial  counseling  or has  a  working  budget.
He  did  not  present  evidence  of  his  and  his  wife’s  current  financial  situation  (gross
monthly income, deductions, monthly expenses, and monthly net remainder).
Except  for  the  accounts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  ($6,264)  and  1.c  ($1,342),
Applicant’s September 2021 credit report shows no additional delinquencies. He paid a
$36  medical  account  in  collection  in  September  2021,  and  has  a  credit  card  with  a
$3,070 balance that is over his $2,700 credit limit, but it is not past due. The 2021 credit
report  also  shows  that  he  is  current  (pays  as  agreed)  on  his auto loan  with  a  monthly
payment of $651, and on his monthly mortgage payments for $446 and $1,990. Without
any documentary evidence of his current financial situation, it is not possible for me to
assess whether or not he is financially overextended
