Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance.  Applicant  denied  generally  each  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR  with
explanations covering the financial allegations that included admissions. Findings of fact
follow.
Background
Applicant has never been married but has cohabited with a significant other since
December  2015.  (GE  1;  Tr.  51-52)  She  had  one  child  from  this  relationship  who  was
delivered stillborn in November 2015. (GE 1) She earned a high school diploma in May
1984. (GE 1) She earned a bachelor’s degree in in May 1992 and a master’s degree in
business  and  health  care  in  May  1996.  (GE  1;  Tr.  50)  Applicant  did  not  report  any
military service.
Since  September  2018,  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  her  current  employer
as an enterprise architect. (GE 1; Tr. 50) Pending the outcome of her security clearance
application, she has been placed on administrative leave. (Tr. 50) Between August 2017
and  May  2018,  she  worked  for  another  employer  as  a  project  manager,  before
terminating her employment over pregnancy issues. (GE 1)
Applicant  was  employed  by  other  employers  in  various  types  of  positions
between  September  2015  and  August  2017.  She  reported  periods  of  unemployment
between  June  2015  and  September  2018.  (GE  1)  Applicant  owned  and  operated  her
own  private  business  between  September  2004  and  June  2015.  (GE  1;  Tr.  54)  She
held  either  a  security  clearance  or  public  trust  position  between  October  2005  and
August  2017,  and  was  reportedly  denied  a  security  clearance  in  August  2018  due  to
financial issues. (GE 1)
Applicant’s finances
Between  2013  and  2015,  Applicant  accumulated  delinquent federal  taxes  owed
the  IRS  for  these  tax  years.  (GEs  1-3)  For  tax  year  2013,  she  accrued  $9,000  in
delinquent  federal  taxes  (inclusive  of  interest  and  penalties  for  late-filing  and  non-
payment).  (Applicant’s   response   and  AE  D)  IRS  tax  transcripts  for  tax  year  2013
document  IRS  application  of  levied  tax  credits  from  other  tax  years  in  March  2017  to
reduce  Applicant’s balance  to zero. (AE D; Tr. 56-57) The IRS tax transcript for tax year
2013  documented  an  installment  agreement  Applicant  arranged  with  the  IRS  in  April
2016 that was cancelled in July 2017 for apparent lack of payment compliance. (AE D)
For  tax  year  2014,  Applicant  reported  federal  taxes  owed  of  $3,400.  (AE  D)
Added   penalties  of   $5,341   to   cover  late   filing   and   payments  raised   Applicant’s  2014
federal  tax  assessment  to  over  $21,000.  (AE  D)  Without  an  installment  agreement  in
place,   the   IRS   supplemented   Applicant’s   one-time October 2017  voluntary payment of
$1,836 with a series of involuntary levies to create a zero balance in May 2019. (AE D;
Tr. 56-57)
IRS transcript records reflect delinquent federal income taxes owed by Applicant
for tax year 2015 exceeding $9,000. (AE D) Applicant’s net taxes for tax year 2015 were
calculated by the IRS in September 2021 to be $6,130, after making allowances for her
withholding  from  her  reported  income  ($6,681),  added  penalties  ($2,223),  accrued
interest  ($2,598),  net  voluntary  payments  from  Applicant  in  2020  ($1,000),  and
involuntary levies from the IRS on scheduled Applicant refunds for other years ($5,979).
(AE D; Tr. 57-59)
With   Applicant’s  credited   voluntary   $1,000   payment  to  the  IRS  in  November
2021, Applicant currently has a reported past-due balance of around $5,130 for tax year
2015,  with  interest  continuing  to  accrue  at  the  legal  rate.  (AEs  D  and  I-J)  While
Applicant had an installment agreement in place for a brief period spanning June 2019
and  May  2020,  the  agreement  was  cancelled  by  the  IRS  in  May  2020  for  non-
compliance with the payment terms of the agreement. (AE D; Tr. 48) IRS records do not
document any other installment agreements with  Applicant.  Since 2015,  Applicant has
stayed  current  with  her  federal  taxes  (i.e.,  for  tax  years  2016-2020),  and  pledged  to
continue to do so in the future with the aid of IRS levies on any scheduled refunds she
is eligible to receive. (AE L; Tr. 60,106)
State tax records reflect past delinquent taxes owed by Applicant to her state of
residence for tax year 2015 in the amount of $12,703. (GE 1 and AE E) From a starting
balance of $15,416 in 2016, Applicant made several payments between 2016 and 2020
through  credited  involuntary  levies.  (AE  E;  Tr.  62)  In  2020,  Applicant  entered  into  an
installment  agreement  with  the  state’s  comptroller.  (AE  E)  Under  this  installment
agreement,  she  made  a  number  of  voluntary  payments  that  reduced  the  overall  tax
amount owed to $12,073. (AE E) When she defaulted in her payment terms, her state’s
comptroller  canceled  her  installment  agreement  in  April  2020.  (AE  E;  Tr.  62-63)
Applicant entered into a new installment agreement with her state’s comptroller’s office
in August 2021. (AE E; Tr. 61-62)
Under  the  terms  of  this  new  installment  agreement,  Applicant  is  obligated  to
make monthly payments of $235, beginning in September 2021. (AE E; Tr. 69-71) While
her  most  recent  bank  statement  reflects  an  October  2021  $235  payment,  it  does  not
credit  her  with  a  September  2021  payment  or  any  other  obligated  payments,  and  it
remains  unclear  from  the  provided  documentation  whether  Applicant  made  either  a
September payment or any other payments called for in the agreement. (AE K; 61-62)
Besides  her
tax  debt  accruals,  Applicant  accumulated  major  delinquent
consumer  debts  over  a  17-year  period  spanning  2004-2021.  Credit  reports  document
that she opened two mortgage accounts in 2005. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 73-74) One was a first
mortgage  for  $583,000,  (covered  by  SOR  ¶  1.e)  in  November  2005,  to  finance  a
$730,000  home  purchase,  and  another  was  a  second  mortgage  of  $86,000  with  the
same  lender  (covered  by  SOR  ¶  1.h)  in  December  2005  to  finance  a  reported  home
equity loan. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 78-79) Credit reports document that Applicant’s first mortgage
holder sold its interest in the mortgage to SOR creditor 1.e in December 2014 on terms
not disclosed. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 74, 116)
For  the  first  10  years  of  her  mortgages,  Applicant  was  able  to  manage  her
mortgages safely without any cost-over-runs. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 76) By 2015, the assessed
value  of  Applicant’s  home  had  fallen  precipitously  to  $429,000.  (Applicant’s  response;
Tr. 27) Facing balloon payments and a devalued home, she ceased making payments
and prepared herself for foreclosure of the first and second mortgages on her property.
(Tr. 27-28, 76-78) Following Applicant’s default in her mortgage payments in June 2015,
SOR creditor 1.e foreclosed (June 2015) its mortgage. (GEs 2-4) Whether the  lender’s
foreclosure produced enough sale proceeds to cover its first mortgage is unclear. Credit
reports do not assign any deficiency balance, and Applicant expressed no awareness of
any remaining deficiency resulting from the foreclosure. (GEs 2-4)
By far, the largest delinquent debt accumulated by Applicant  between 2005 and
2020  is  covered  by  SOR  ¶  1.g.  (GEs  2-4  and  AEs  F  and  H;  Tr.  28-29)  This  reported
charged-off  account  is  documented  in  Applicant’s  credit  reports  as  a  $214,175
consumer account with a major credit card firm that is covered by SOR ¶ 1.g.  Through
this credit card firm, Applicant financed advertising  credits  with a major internet firm in
excess of $224,000 during 2014. (GEs 2-4 and AEs F and H; Tr. 39-46, 91, 102) After
advancing over $60,000 to SOR creditor 1.g to cover initial advertising charges with the
creditor’s  internet  merchant,  she  found  a  number  of  claimed  discrepancies  in  the
number of clicks the merchant charged her. (AE H; Tr. 85-86, 91, 102)
At  Applicant’s  request,  SOR  creditor  1.g  opened  a  billing  dispute  over  these
charges  in  June  2014.  (AE  F;  Tr.  38-48,  78-80)  After  a  thorough  review  of  the
documentation  furnished  by  its  internet  customer,  SOR  creditor  1.g  validated  the
charges  for  its  merchant’s  services  to  Applicant  and  referred  Applicant  to  the  internet
merchant for further information and discussions. (AE F) Following up with the internet
merchant,  Applicant  sought  clarifications  of  the  internet’s  costing  data  for  Applicant’s
registered  clicks  to  its  site  in  2014.  (AE  H)  In  email  exchanges  with  the  merchant,
Applicant  claimed  only  839  visits  to  the  merchant’s  internet  site  and  questioned  the
71,000 visits credited to her by the merchant. (AE H)
Ensuing  investigations  by  both  the  credit  card  issuer  and  the  charging  internet
merchant  with  Applicant-supplied  data  produced  favorable  results  for  the  financing
credit  card  firm  who  confirmed  the  validity  of  the  billings.  (AEs  F  and  H;  Tr.  90-91)
Communications  between  Applicant  and  the  internet  merchant  whose  services  she
used for her business advertising never facilitated any kind of resolution of the charges
billed to SOR creditor 1.g. Unable to convince her creditors of the validity of her claims,
Applicant  ceased  all  communications  with  both  the  creditor  and  its  internet  merchant
after June  2014.  (GEs 2-4  and  AEs  F and  H;  Tr. 38-46)  Applicant’s  dispute  with  SOR
creditor  1.g  has  never  been  resolved.  (Tr.  92)  Credit  reports  confirm  that  in  2016  the
debt  was  charged  off  to  profit  and  loss.  (GEs  2-4)  And,  the  debt  has  since  been
removed from Applicant’s 2021 credit report. (GEs 2-4 and AE C; Tr. 34-35, 136-137)
Whether  Applicant’s  dispute  with  SOR  creditor  1.g.  can  be  attributed  to  good-
faith  misunderstandings  over  the  merchant’s  billing  practices  (i.e.,  charging  for  the
number of clicks to the website rather than for the number of visits) is unclear based on
the  documentation  and  hearing testimony supplied  by Applicant.  To  date,  she  has  not
provided  any  contemporaneous  documentation  of  the  claims  materials  she  furnished
SOR  creditor  1.g,  or  any  other  substantiating  documentation  to  aid  in  assessing  the
merits of her dispute.
Pertinent  documentation  from  Applicant  covering  her  dispute  with  SOR  creditor
1.g could be expected to yield information covering the substance of her disputes with
her  creditors,  any  settlement  discussions  between  the  parties,  and  whether  Applicant
ever offered to pay SOR creditor 1.g for the charges she acknowledged to be legitimate.
Without  more  evidence  from  Applicant  on  the  substantive  grounds  of  her  dispute  with
SOR  creditor  1.g,  and  any  prior  initiatives  taken  by  Applicant  with  the  creditor  and  its
internet customer to resolve her dispute amicably, either bilaterally or through mutually
enlisted  arbitration  and  mediation  services  available  in  her  community,  before
suspending  any  further  payments  to  the  creditor,  the  debt  dispute  issues  raised  by
Applicant cannot be favorably resolved.
Other  large  delinquent  debts  are  covered  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.h  and  1.l.  SOR  ¶  1.h
involves  a  mortgage  debt  of  $86,617  arising  out  of  a  home  equity  loan  Applicant
arranged on her former residence in December 2005. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 78-79) After making
a few payments on   this loan   following   the   first mortgagee’s foreclosure of   its  mortgage
interest,  Applicant  ceased  making  payments  on  the  loan  altogether.  (GEs  2-4;  Tr.  79-
80) This debt was charged off by the lender in August 2019, with no activity noted in the
account since 2016. (GEs 2-4)
Applicant’s claims that this second mortgage  (SOR ¶ 1.h) was resolved with the
2016  foreclosure  of  the  first  mortgage  on  the  property  are  not  corroborated  by  any
evidence developed in the record. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 27, 29-30) Without any remaining sale
proceeds from the 2016 foreclosure sale,  SOR creditor 1.h became essentially a sold-
out junior lien holder with no security left to recover its loan outlays. While this debt has
fallen off of Applicant’s 2021 credit report, it remains unresolved. (AE C; Tr. 34-35)
In 2017, Applicant filed a law suit against her former employer (SOR creditor 1.f)
over  a  dispute  involving  her  performance  contract.  (GEs  2-4;  Tr.  81-83)  In  2017  court
proceedings,  Applicant was  denied  the  relief  she  sought  and  was  assessed  attorneys’
fees  of  $5,397.  After  making  two  $200  payments  to  the  judgment  creditor  under  an
agreement she reached with the creditor, she could no longer fit the monthly payments
within her budget and ceased making payments. (AE N; Tr. 85-86; 112-113) Neither her
bank statement nor her credit reports provide any updates or clarifications of the status
of this judgment debt, and the debt remains unresolved.
In addition to her other mortgage debts, Applicant incurred a mortgage debt with
a  small  reported  balance  of  $361  noted  in  her  credit  reports  on  a  mortgage  account
reportedly opened in 2004 with SOR creditor 1.k. (GEs 2-4 and AE M) Before charging
off the debt, SOR creditor 1.k canceled the remaining $361 charge on the mortgage and
released the lien covering the charge on the mortgage (AE  M) Based  on  the  creditor’s
actions the SOR ¶ 1.k debt is extinguished and resolved favorably to Applicant.
SOR  creditor  1.l  covers  a  delinquent  account  with  Applicant’s  current  first
mortgagee.  The  reported  mortgage  in  Applicant’s  credit  reports  is  a  conventional
mortgage  on  her  current  residence.  Since  October  2020,  the  mortgage  has  been  in
forbearance  status.  (AE  C;  Tr.  99)  While  she  incurred  recurrent  delinquencies  in  the
account before the account was placed in forbearance, no payments are currently due
on  the mortgage  pending its  return from  Covid-19-based  deferment.  (GEs 2-4  and AE
C;  Tr.  98-99)  Once  the  deferred  loan  is  returned  to  active  status,  she  is  committed  to
resuming  her  $1,027  monthly  payments.  (Tr.  98-99,  112-113)  Considering  the
substantial interest she has in the property and the underlying mortgage, Applicant can
be  expected  to  resume  her  scheduled  loan  payments  when  they  become  due,
Favorable resolution is warranted on this debt.
Medical  debts admitted  by Applicant, but later challenged,  are  covered by SOR
¶¶1.i  and  1.j.  (GEs  1-4)  Applicant  challenges  these  charged-off  debts  without  any
explanations of the legal basis of her disputes with the creditors. (Tr. 92) Both debts list
$780 delinquent balances that Applicant claims are associated with her unplanned visits
to  the  hospital  in  2016  who  delivered  her  stillborn  baby.  While  these  debts  could  be
duplicates, they bear different account numbers and are not challenged by Applicant on
duplication  grounds.  Without  more  information  from  Applicant  on  the  facts  and
circumstances of these debts, these medical debts remain unresolved.
A final consumer debt listed in the SOR is covered by SOR ¶ 1.m. This debt lists
a past-due account of $28 on an $897 balance that is reported as current in Applicant’s
August  2021  credit  report.  (AE  C;  Tr.  100)  Inferences  are  warranted  that  this  debt  is
resolved.
Applicant  earns  $150,000  a  year  from  her  current  employer  and  shares
household  expenses  with  her  significant  other.  (Tr.  52)  She  has  a  401(k)  retirement
account  with  approximately  $200,000  in  her  plan.  (Tr.  53)  She  has  not  received  any
documented financial counseling to date. Nor has she provided a monthly budget. With
little reported savings to deal with her delinquent accounts, it is not clear what resources
Applicant  can  expect  to  have  on  hand  to  address  her  still  unresolved  debts.  (Tr.  52)
While endorsements and performance evaluations might have been helpful in facilitating
a  whole-assessment  of  Applicant’s  overall  reliability  and  trustworthiness,  none  were
furnished.
