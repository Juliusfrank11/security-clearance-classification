In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  allegations.  I  have
incorporated  those  admissions  into  my  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 29 years old. He has never married, but is currently engaged. He has
a  bachelor’s  degree.  He  has  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  since  February  2021.
From January 2020 to February 2021, he also worked for a defense contractor. He has
never held a security clearance. He completed his security clearance application (SCA)
in January 2020. (Tr. 6, 17; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant:  used  and  purchased  marijuana,  with  varying
frequency,  from  August  2011  to  October  2019;  was  arrested  and  charged  with
possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia in January 2012; and was arrested for
driving under the influence of and possession of marijuana in August 2013. (See SOR
¶¶ 1.a - 1.c.)
Applicant  began  using  marijuana  shortly  after  graduating  from  high  school.  He
continued  to  use  it  sporadically  throughout  college.  He  acknowledged  that  he  made
“bad decisions” in that regard. He was arrested in January 2012 for using marijuana in
his dorm room when a resident advisor reported it. In August 2013, he was driving after
having  used  marijuana  and  was  stopped  by  law  enforcement  for  speeding.  He  was
suspected  of  driving  under  the  influence  of  marijuana  and  arrested.  His  use  of
marijuana was confirmed by a blood test. He pleaded guilty to a reckless driving charge
and satisfied all the terms of his sentence without incident. (Tr. 19-22, 27)
Applicant credibly testified that his last use of marijuana was in 2017. He stated
that the reference in his March 2020 statement to a background investigator that his last
use was in 2019 was a mistake. He has dissociated from his college friends with whom
he used marijuana. He has no intentions of using marijuana in the future. He reported
his marijuana use on his SCA and during his background investigation. (Tr. 22, 24-25;
GE 1, 2)
Applicant presented a letter from his work supervisor. His supervisor recognized
Applicant as a trustworthy employee and highly dependable. (AE B)
