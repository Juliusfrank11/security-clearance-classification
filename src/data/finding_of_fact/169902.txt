Applicant, age 34, is married with two minor children. He earned his high school
diploma  in  2005.  He  has  been  employed  as  a  plant  room  operator  by  a  hotel  since
February  2020.  This  is  his  first  application  for  a  security  clearance.  Although  it  is  not
explicitly  stated  therein,  the  record  suggests  that  the  defense  contractor  sponsoring
Applicant’s SCA, and for whom he has not yet begun working, has extended an offer of
employment contingent upon a favorable determination. (Item 4)
The  SOR  alleged  10  delinquent  debts  totaling  $27,182,  and  that  Applicant
deliberately failed  to  disclose  any  delinquent  debts,  including  nine  of  the  alleged  SOR
debts, on his SCA. In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted each of the SOR allegations
without explanation. His credit reports, dated May 2020 and January 2021, also confirm
the alleged debts. (Items 1, 3, 6, 7)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a ($5,257) was the amount charged by Applicant’s
former landlord in about December 2016, when Applicant terminated his apartment lease
three  to  four  months  early.  During  the  May  2020  security  clearance  interview  (SCI)
conducted in connection with his SCA background investigation, Applicant expressed an
intent  to  pay  this  debt  using  funds  from  a  financial  account  that  he  anticipated  would
mature in Fall 2020. This debt remains unresolved. (Item 5 at 3-4)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b ($1,870) is a credit-card account that was charged
off  by  the  creditor  in  April  2016.  Applicant  last  made  a  payment  to  the  creditor  in
September  2015.  During  his  SCI,  Applicant  explained  that  he  opened  this  account  to
purchase a washer and dryer. He expressed an intent to contact the creditor to resolve
this debt. This debt remains unresolved. (Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 7; Item 7 at 2)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c ($2,892) is a credit-card account that was charged
off by the creditor in April 2016. Applicant last made a payment to the creditor in August
2015. Applicant opened this account to purchase food, gas, and basic necessities. This
debt remains unresolved. (Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 5; Item 7 at 3)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d ($2,098) is a credit-card account that was placed
for collection by the creditor in about June 2016. The account first became delinquent in
October 2015. Applicant opened this account to purchase food, tires, and tools. During
his  SCI,  Applicant  detailed  an  arrangement  he  negotiated  with  the  creditor  to  make  a
$1,250 lump-sum payment to resolve this debt. This debt remains unresolved. (Item 5 at
2-3; Item 6 at 6; Item 7 at 3)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e ($5,497) is an automobile-loan account that was
charged  off  by  the  creditor  in  February  2016.  Applicant  opened  this  account  in  March
2014, and last made a payment to the creditor in October 2015. Applicant fell behind on
this account because he obtained another vehicle. During his SCI, Applicant expressed
an intent to contact the creditor to settle the debt. This debt remains unresolved. (Item 5
at 4; Item 6 at 6; Item 7 at 3)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f  ($4,749) is another automobile-loan account that
was charged off by the creditor in March 2016. Applicant opened this account in March
2014, and first became delinquent in September 2015. He last made a payment to the
creditor in February 2016. Applicant fell behind on this account because he traded in this
vehicle for a larger vehicle, which added to his loan balance. During his SCI, Applicant
detailed  an  arrangement  he  made  with  the  creditor  to  settle  the  debt  for  the  reduced
amount of $2,098 a few months earlier, in February or March 2020. He asserted that he
had not yet paid the debt as of his  SCI because he was trying to  save money for one
lump-sum payment. This debt remains unresolved. (Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 5; Item 7 at 3)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g ($1,242) is a credit-card account that was charged
off by the creditor in April 2016. The account first became delinquent in October 2015.
Applicant opened this account to purchase a television and other miscellaneous items.
During  his  SCI,  Applicant  detailed  an  arrangement  he  made  with  the  creditor  the  day
before his SCI to settle the account in one lump-sum payment, and his plan to make that
payment by the end of the week. This debt remains unresolved. (Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 7;
Item 7 at 4)
The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶1.h  ($3,025)  is  a  debt  consolidation  loan  on  which
Applicant defaulted in about 2016. During his SCI, Applicant attributed his default to the
loan’s high interest rate, and expressed an intent to contact the creditor to settle the debt.
This debt remains unresolved. (Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 6)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i ($442) is a utility account for  Internet service that
was placed for collection by the creditor in about May 2019. During his  SCI, Applicant
asserted that he disputed the debt on the basis that he had cancelled the service and
returned the equipment. He claimed that he was billed for equipment and service that he
did  not receive.  He did  not proffer any documents  corroborating his  dispute. This debt
remains unresolved. (Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 8; Item 7 at 4)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j ($110) is a utility account for Internet service that
was placed for collection by the creditor in about September 2018. The last reported date
of activity on this account was September 2016. During his SCI, Applicant asserted that
he  disputed  the  debt  on  the  basis  that  he  had  cancelled  the  service,  returned  the
equipment,  and  thought  that  he  had  paid  the  account  in  full.  He  did  not  proffer  any
documents corroborating his dispute. He expressed an intent to contact the creditor to
pay the debt despite his dispute. This debt remains unresolved. (Item 5 at 1; Item 6 at 8)
Applicant’s 2020 credit report revealed a $280 debt for a credit-card account that
was charged off by the creditor in January 2017. Because this debt was not alleged in the
SOR, I will consider it only to evaluate mitigation and the whole-person concept. Applicant
opened this account to purchase a car battery. The account first became delinquent in
August  2016.  During  his  SCI,  Applicant  expressed  an  intent  to  contact  the  creditor  to
settle  the  debt.  His  2021  credit  report  confirmed  that  Applicant  resolved  this  debt  in
October 2020. (Item 5 at 1-4; Item 6 at 8; Item 7 at 2-3)
On his SCA, Applicant answered  “no” to all questions about his financial record,
including whether, in the last seven years, he: 1) had defaulted on any type of loan; 2)
had debts turned over to a collection agency; or 3) had credit-card accounts charged off
for failing to pay as agreed. He did not otherwise disclose any of the SOR debts on his
SCA. (Item 4 at 37-38)
During his SCI, Applicant was asked if, in the last seven years, he had bills turned
over to collections or had an account charged off for failure to pay. In response to that
question, he volunteered information about the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a and stated that
no other accounts could be recalled.  After being confronted with information about the
debts alleged in SOR 1.b  through 1.j, Applicant acknowledged and provided additional
details concerning each debt. When asked why he did not list any debts on his SCA, he
explained  that,  until  he  was  confronted  with  them  during  the  SCI:  1)  he  had  forgotten
about the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.d, 1.g, and 1.h, and 2) he was not aware
of the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j. Although he attempted to list the debt alleged
in SOR ¶ 1.a on the SCA with information that he knew, because the information known
was incomplete, the system would not accept incomplete account information. He did not
list the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f on the SCA because he believed that they
occurred outside of the seven-year reporting window. (Item 5)
Applicant  was  offered  an  opportunity  to  provide  documentation  for  the  financial
accounts discussed during his SCI. He timely submitted those documents, including: 1)
a February 2017 notice alerting Applicant that the account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b had been
placed for collection; 2) a February 2017 offer to settle the account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g
for a discounted payoff of $870; 3) a March 2020 statement concerning the charged-off
account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d; 4) an April 2017 notice alerting Applicant that the account
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f had been placed for collection; and 5) a June 2020 confirmation of
an agreement to settle the account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j for the reduced amount of $72.
(Item 5 at 7-13)
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  issues  primarily  to  underemployment  and  poor
debt  management.  He  also  cited  a  relocation,  new  child,  and  new  employment  as
contributing factors. Although he did not specify the underlying details, the SCA revealed
that he relocated from state A to state B in December 2016; that his youngest child was
born  in  September  2016;  and  that  he  was  unemployed  from  December  2016  through
February 2017 due to his relocation. (Item 4 at 14, 26; Item 5 at 4)
During  his  SCI,  Applicant  described  his  financial  situation  as  making  enough
money to get by, while also stating that he was not making a lot of money. He maintained
that  he  was  very  willing  and  able  to  repay  his  debts,  but  did  not  proffer any  details  or
corroborating  documents  concerning  his  relevant  income  and  expense  history  or  his
ability to repay his debts. He indicated that he had a savings account without specifying
the amount therein. He did not anticipate any further financial difficulties because his wife
had taken over the  responsibility of  managing their finances. He had not  received  any
financial counseling. He travelled to Japan for eleven to twenty days between December
2019 and January 2020 to visit U.S. citizen friends who were stationed there. The record
did not indicate any of  the associated costs or how those costs were paid.  Applicant’s
January  2021  credit  report  revealed  no  new  delinquent  debts  or  recently  opened
accounts. (Item 4 at 31-32; Item 5 at 4; Item 7)
After his relocation to state B, Applicant was employed as an appliance technician
from  February  2017  through  February  2020.  He  left  that  position  due  to  a  lack  of
advancement opportunities. When he resided in state A, Applicant held various positions
in the service industry including: 1) as a facilities technician at a fitness studio from April
2016 through December 2016 (he left due to his relocation); 2) as an appliance technician
for  an  appliance  services  company  from  May  2015  through  April  2016  (he  left  for  a
“Change of career”); 3) as a technician at an automobile dealership from January 2012
through May 2015 (he left for a “Change of career”); 4) as a customer service advisor at
an automobile service and repair company from December 2011 through January 2012
(he  left  to  pursue  another  opportunity);  5)  as  a  bartender  at  a  hotel  from  March  2011
through December 2011 (he left for a “Change of career”); and 6) as a barista at a coffee
shop from September 2008 through March 2011 (he left to pursue another opportunity).
(Item 4 at 14-19).
