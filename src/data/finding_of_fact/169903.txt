In Applicant’s SOR response, he  admitted he incurred the debts listed in SOR ¶¶
1.a to 1.e. (HE 2) He also admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a that he had a friendship
with  AK,  a Saudi citizen  then  serving as  a  Saudi enlisted man. He  provided mitigating
information and proof of some payments to his creditors. (HE 3) Applicant’s admissions
are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant is a native-born U.S. citizen who is 45 years old. (GE 1) He has been
employed since July 2020 as a maintenance controller working in the Middle East (not
Saudi Arabia) for an ally of the United States on high-performance fighter aircraft sold to
the Middle Eastern country by U.S. companies under the Foreign Military Sales program.
(Tr.  31)  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  Marine  Corps  from  1987  to  2007.  (Tr.  7)  He
honorably  retired  as  a  staff  sergeant  (E-6).  (Tr.  7)  He  did  not  receive  any  disciplinary
actions in the Marine Corps such as nonjudicial punishment or written reprimands. (Tr. 7-
8) He served two tours in Iraq. (Tr. 8) In 1987, he earned a high school diploma. (Tr. 7)
He has two years of college; however, he  does not have a degree. (Tr. 7) In 2013, he
married his spouse in Saudi Arabia, and his children with his spouse are ages four, seven,
and eight years old. (Tr. 10) His wife and children are living in Australia. (Tr. 10)
Financial Considerations
On  January 16,  2003,  the  Department  of  the  Navy  Central  Adjudication  Facility
issued Applicant a letter of intent (LOI) to revoke security clearance, which raised security
concerns under Guidelines E (personal conduct) and F (financial considerations). (GE 5
at 3) The 2003 SOR alleged that Applicant failed to disclose any delinquent accounts on
his October 11, 2000 SCA. (GE 5 at 5) His 2003 SOR also alleged his November 8, 2000
credit report indicated: he had two accounts that were previously at least 120 days past
due;  one  paid  judgment;  two  paid  collection  accounts;  and  three  delinquent  collection
accounts for the following amounts: $260; $1,089; and $679.  (GE 5 at 5) Applicant did
not respond to the 2003 LOI; and his security clearance was revoked on January 3, 2004.
(GE 5 at 1) Applicant said he was deployed to Iraq when his clearance was revoked, and
he was never informed that his security clearance was revoked. (GE 2 at 2)
In 2013, Applicant was  injured in a traffic accident  in Saudi Arabia.  He  incurred
medical bills and lost part of his salary when he was unable to work. (Tr. 85-87) In 2015,
he  had  back  surgery,  and  he  missed  five  months  of  work.  (Tr.  89;  SOR  response)
Applicant’s father-in-law, who lives in Australia, had medical problems. Applicant funded
his spouse and children’s travel from Saudi Arabia to Australia four times  to enable his
spouse could care for her father. (Tr. 61, 76-79; SOR response) In 2016, he only received
partial  pay  for  six months  because  his  employer  was  having  difficulty  with  renewing  a
contract in Saudi Arabia. (Tr. 90-91; GE 2 at 2)
In August 2019, Applicant traveled to Australia for 21 to 30 days. (Tr. 72)  It cost
about $2,800 for him to travel from Saudi Arabia to Australia and return to Saudi Arabia.
(Tr.  79)  In  July  2019,  Applicant  returned  to  the  United  States  for  treatment  of  a  heart
ailment, and he missed work for 10 months. (Tr. 36, 88-90; GE 1; HE 2) He received the
medical treatments for his heart from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). (Tr. 36)
His only source of income while unemployed was his Marine Corps retirement. (Id.)
In May 2020, Applicant started working with his creditors. (Tr. 66-67) In June 2020,
he began working for a large U.S. contractor supporting a foreign air force at an overseas
location. (GE 1 at 14; Tr. 38) In August 2020, he completed his SCA, and he indicated he
planned to resolve his delinquent debts as soon as his employment became stable. (GE
1)  In  September  2020,  he  had  his  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  personal
subject interview (PSI), and he related that he was using automatic payments to pay one
large  debt.  (GE  2)  He  promised  to  establish  payment  arrangements  with  his  other
creditors. (Id.) Applicant’s June  15,  2021 credit report shows eight accounts in paid status,
and  six  accounts  in  collection  or  charged-off  status.  (GE  3)  He  has  not  taken  any
international travel away from his place of employment since July 2020. (Tr. 82)
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  has  five  delinquent  accounts  totaling  $61,148,  as
follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a is a charged-off credit union debt for $19,375. Applicant’s credit reports
indicate the account was opened in October 2015 (account ending in 89). (Tr. 52-53; GE
3 at 7; GE 4 at 2) He started to miss payments in May 2018. (Tr. 53; GE 4) Applicant’s
Marine Corps retirement check is deposited into the credit union identified in SOR ¶ 1.a,
and the credit union uses the funds to make payments to  address the two credit union
debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c. (Tr. 62, 67)
On July 31, 2021, the creditor offered to settle the  $13,765 balance for a single
payment of $3,441; however, Applicant did not pay the settlement amount. (AE C at 3)
Applicant  provided  receipts  showing the  following payments  to  address  the  account  in

SOR ¶ 1.b is a charged-off credit card debt for $19,323. (Tr. 57-59; AE A; GE 7 at
4) On April 6, 2021, the creditor offered to settle the debt for a single payment of $1,932,
or two $966 payments which were required to be made on May 5, 2021, and on June 4,
2021. (AE A at 1) On May 18, 2021,  the creditor offered to settle the debt for a  single
payment of $2,898, or two $1,449 payments which were required to be made on June 16,
2021,  and  on  July  16,  2021.  (AE  A  at  2)  On  June  28,  2021,  the  creditor  wrote  that
Applicant  authorized  a  $1,449  payment  by  phone  on  June  28,  2021.  (AE  A  at  3)  The
creditor said a check would be sent to Applicant for the second $1,449 payment. (Id.) It
is unclear why the  creditor would  send a  check  to Applicant unless  there was  another
account with the creditor. (AE A at 3) On June 29, 2021, the creditor offered to settle the
debt for a single payment of $2,898, or two $1,449 payments which were required to be
made on July 28, 2021, and on August 27, 2021. (AE A at 4) The June 29, 2021 letter
indicated the amount of the debt was reduced to $17,874. (Id.) On June 29, 2021, and
July 5, 2021, the creditor wrote that one payment of $1,449 was due on July 16, 2021, to
resolve the debt, and the payment would be made using a credit card. (AE A at 5-6) On
July 27, 2021, the creditor wrote the final payment was received in accordance with the
settlement agreement; however, if the payment was returned for any reason the account
would go into default. (AE A at 7)
On  July  29,  2021,  the  creditor  wrote  the  settlement  agreement  was  cancelled
“because  of  missed  or  returned  payments,”  and  the  debt  would  be  turned  over  to  a
collection agency. (AE A at 8) Applicant provided a spreadsheet showing two payments
to the creditor: on June 28, 2021, he paid $1,449; and on January 9, 2022, he paid $894.
(AE F) All of the letters from the creditor cite the same account number. Applicant said he
made  both  of  the  payments  to  settle  the  debt.  (Tr.  57-59,  100-101)  I  requested  that
Applicant provide documentation showing the second payment to the creditor. (Tr. 91-93)
He  provided  a  spreadsheet  which  shows  the  $1,449  payment  and  the  $894  payment;
however, the spreadsheet does not show the balance or available funds on August 27,
2021, when the final payment was due. (AE F) He did not provide proof of a payment in
August  2021.  Applicant’s  failure  to  make  the  second  payment  may  have  been  due,  at
least in part, to having his mail sent to his mother’s residence in the United States, and
she only sent his mail to the Middle East once a month. (GE 2 at 2; AE A, address on
correspondence from creditor is his mother’s address) The balance owed as of January
9, 2022, is $16,980. (GE 7 at 4)
SOR ¶ 1.c is a charged-off credit union debt for $14,545. The debt originated from
a vehicle loan (the account number ends in 05). (Tr. 65-66) The following table shows the

SOR ¶ 1.d is bank debt placed for collection for $5,823. On June 3, 2021, Applicant
and the creditor agreed that he would pay $400 monthly from June 2021 to April 2022, to
resolve the $5,823 debt. (Tr. 55; AE B at 1) He provided seven receipts and showed that
as of October 2021, he had reduced the balance owed to $3,823. (AE B at 2-8) According
to his most recent credit report, his balance is $3,023. (Tr. 63; GE 7 at 1-2)
SOR  ¶  1.e  is  a  collection  debt  for  $2,082.  Applicant  provided  a  spreadsheet
showing nine $200 payments made on a monthly basis from April 15, 2021, to December

Foreign Influence
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges Applicant has a friend, AK, who is a citizen and resident of Saudi
Arabia who serves or served in the Royal Saudi Air Force.
From 2009 to 2018, Applicant worked in Saudi Arabia for several U.S. contractors
in support of the Saudi Air Force. (Tr. 35; GE 1) From 2012 to 2016, he worked closely
with AK, who was Applicant’s supervisor when he worked at an air base in Saudi Arabia.
(Tr.  17,  39;  GE  1  at  23-24)  AK  was  enlisted  in  the  Saudi  Air  Force.  (GE  1)  Applicant
enjoyed recreational activities with AK and others in the mountains or deserts during off-
duty time. (Tr. 40, 49) After leaving the employment where he worked closely with  AK,
Applicant and his family continued to live in Saudi Arabia, and they socialized with AK
and his family. (Tr. 41-42) For example, they went shopping and had dinner together in
restaurants. (Tr. 41-42)
In  2017,  Applicant  moved  his family from  Saudi Arabia  to  Australia  because  he
was concerned about the conflict between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis in Yemen. (Tr.
75-77;  SOR  response)  See  Administrative  Notice.  His  spouse  is  a  citizen  of  Australia,
and she is not a citizen of the United States. (Tr. 75-77) In 2017, his spouse was unable
to obtain a Visa to the United States in a timely manner. (Tr. 75)  She did not return to
Saudi Arabia after 2017. (Tr. 77) She has never traveled to the United States. (Tr. 97-98)
Applicant, his spouse, and children intend to eventually move to the United States. (Tr.
98)
The last time Applicant physically met AK was in 2018. (Tr. 42) The last time he
received a communication from AK was in October 2021 on social media. (Tr. 43, 46-47)
There were about 15 Saudis in the same social media group. (Tr. 47)
AK left the Saudi Air Force, and he currently works for a U.S.-owned company that
does  work  for  the  Saudi  Arabian  Air  Force  providing  maintenance  support  on  U.S.-
manufactured aircraft in Saudi Arabia. (Tr. 44-45) AK was trained in the United States by
a large defense aerospace contractor. (Tr. 45) Applicant does not believe that  AK had
any connections to intelligence entities. (Tr. 45-46) No Saudi ever asked Applicant to do
anything inappropriate or to provide any sensitive information. (Tr. 48) He does not have
any property or bank accounts in Saudi Arabia. (Tr. 49) He does not owe any money to
anyone in Saudi Arabia. (Tr. 50)
Saudi Arabia
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a monarchy ruled by King Salman bin Abdulaziz
Al Saud, who is both head of state and head of government. The 1992 Basic Law sets
out  the  system  of  governance,  rights  of  citizens,  and  powers  and  duties  of  the
government,  and  it  provides  that  the  Quran  and  Sunna  (the  traditions  of  the  Prophet
Muhammad) serve as the country’s constitution. It specifies that the rulers of the country
shall be male descendants of the founder, King Abdulaziz (Ibn Saud).
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  has  issued  a  Level  4  Travel  Advisory  regarding
Saudi Arabia, advising U.S. travelers not to travel to Saudi Arabia due to COVID-19 …
reconsider travel to Saudi Arabia due to the threat of missile and drone attacks on civilian
facilities,  and  exercise  increased  caution  in  Saudi  Arabia  due  to  terrorism.  The  U.S.
Department of State advises not to travel within 50 miles of miles of  the Saudi-Yemen
border, as well as to the cities of  Abha, Jizan, Najran, and Khamis Mushayt;  the Abha
airport;  and  Qatif  in  the  Eastern  Province  and  its  suburbs,  including  Awamiyah  due  to
missile and drone attacks and terrorism.
Missile and drone attacks perpetrated by Iran and Iran-supported militant groups
represent a significant threat. The Islamic Republic of  Iran has supplied Yemen-based
Houthis  and  other  regional  proxy  groups  with  weapons  to  conduct  destructive  and
sometimes lethal attacks using drones, missiles, and rockets against a variety of Saudi
sites, including critical infrastructure, civilian airports, military bases, and energy facilities
throughout  the  country,  as  well  as  vessels in  Red  Sea  shipping  lanes.  Recent  attacks
were  aimed  at  targets  throughout  Saudi  Arabia,  including  Riyadh,  Jeddah,  Dhahran,
Jizan, Khamis Mushayt, the civilian airport in Abha, Al Kharj, military installations in the
south, as well as oil and gas facilities. U.S. citizens living and working near military bases
and  critical  civilian  infrastructure,  particularly  near  the  border  with  Yemen,  are  at
heightened risk of missile, drone, and rocket attacks.
Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Saudi Arabia. Terrorists may
attack  with  little  or  no  warning,  targeting  tourist  locations,  transportation  hubs,
markets/shopping  malls,  and  local  government  facilities.  Terrorists  have  targeted  both
Saudi and Western government interests, mosques and other religious sites (both Sunni
and Shia), and places frequented by U.S. citizens and other Westerners.
Militant  groups  in  Yemen  have  attacked  Saudi  border  towns  and  other  sites  in
Saudi Arabia with armed drones, missiles, and rockets. Civilians that are near the border
with Yemen are especially at risk. Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in
Saudi Arabia including in Qatif.
Saudi Arabia suffered from numerous terrorist incidents in 2019 (the most recent
year  for  which  the  U.S.  State  Department’s  report  was  published).  Terrorist  incidents
included  both  external  attacks  by  Iranian  and  Houthi  actors  and  small-scale  attacks,
largely  perpetrated  by  lone  offender  actors  including,  ISIS  sympathizers.  Militants
instigated violence using IEDs, gunfire, and UAS. [Several representative attacks in 2019
in Saudi Arabia were omitted.]
On December 6, 2019, a member of the Royal Saudi Air Force opened fire in a
classroom at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida, killing three and wounding eight. The
gunman, 2nd Lt Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, was a student who was receiving training
at the base. The FBI later noted that Alshamrani had coordinated with  al-Qaeda in the
Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) before the terrorist attack, for which the latter claimed credit.
In an August 31, 2021 press statement, the U.S. Department of State condemned
a  recent  Houthi  attack  against  Saudi  Arabia  that  struck  the  civilian  airport  in  Abha,
wounding eight civilians and damaging a commercial airliner. The statement noted that
since the beginning of the year, Saudi Arabia has endured more than 240 attacks from
the Houthis, who have endangered the Saudi people alongside more than 70,000  U.S.
citizens residing in Saudi Arabia.
Significant human rights issues in Saudi Arabia in 2020 included: unlawful killings;
executions  for  nonviolent  offenses; forced  disappearances;  torture and  cases  of  cruel,
inhuman,  or  degrading  treatment  of  prisoners  and  detainees  by  government  agents;
harsh  and  life  threatening  prison  conditions;  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention;  political
prisoners or detainees; serious restrictions on free expression, the press, and the internet,
including  threats  of  violence  or  unjustified  arrests  or  prosecutions  against  journalists,
censorship,  site  blocking,  and  engaging  in  harassment  and  intimidation  against  Saudi
dissidents living abroad; substantial interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly
and  freedom  of  association;  severe  restrictions  of  religious  freedom;  restrictions  on
freedom of movement; inability of citizens to choose their government peacefully through
free  and  fair  elections;  violence  and  discrimination  against  women,  although  new
women’s  rights  initiatives  were  implemented;  trafficking  in  persons;  criminalization  of
consensual same-sex sexual activity; and restrictions on workers’ freedom of association,
including prohibition of trade unions and collective bargaining.
On  February  11,  2021,  the  U.S.  Office  of  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence
assessed  that  Saudi  Arabia’s  Crown  Prince  Muhammad  bin  Salman  approved  an
operation  to  capture  or  kill  journalist  Jamal  Khashoggi.  The  report  noted  the  Crown
Prince’s support for  using  violent measures to  silence dissidents abroad. It also stated
that  the  Crown  Prince  had  absolute  control  of  the  Kingdom’s  security  and  intelligence
operations.
On February 26, 2021, the U.S. Department of State announced “Khashoggi Ban,”
a  new  visa  restriction  policy  pursuant  to  section  212(a)(3)(C)  of  the  Immigration  and
Nationality Act. It further announced  that it  was  imposing visa  restrictions on 76 Saudi
individuals believed to have been engaged in threatening dissidents overseas, including
but not limited to the Khashoggi killing.
