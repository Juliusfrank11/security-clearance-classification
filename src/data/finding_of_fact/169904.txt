SOR  ¶  1.a  alleged  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency,  from
about 2012 to 2013, after he was granted eligibility for a public trust position. SOR ¶ 1.b
alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency, between 2015 and 2018,
after  he  was  granted  access  to  classified  information.  Applicant  admitted  both  SOR
allegations. His  SOR admissions are incorporated  as findings  of fact. After a  thorough
review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  graduated  from
high  school  in  2003,  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2007,  and  completed  a  master’s
degree in 2009. He has never been married and has no children.
Applicant  has  worked  for  federal  contractors  holding  varied  positions  from
January  2010  to  present.  He  worked  as  a  program  analyst  for  a  federal  contractor
between January 2010 and March 2015. While in that position, he applied for and was
granted eligibility for a public trust position in March 2010. After holding the public trust
position, he illegally used marijuana at least four times between June 2012 and August
2013.  He  stated  that  he  smoked  marijuana  while  visiting  a  long-time  friend  in  another
state.
During a  May 13,  2015  interview  with  a  government  investigator, Applicant  was
questioned about his illegal use of marijuana. He indicated he was associating less with
his marijuana-using friend because he had a girlfriend. He told the investigator that he
did not intend to use marijuana in the future. (FORM, Item 3) following the background
investigation, Applicant was granted eligibility for a secret clearance in August 2015.
Applicant  worked  for  federal  contractors  as  a  senior  program  analyst  between
March 2015 and December 2019, and as a network data analyst between March 2020
and  January  2021.  He  started  working  for  his  current  employer  in  January  2021.  He
submitted his most recent SCA in August 2020.
During a September 23, 2020 interview with a government investigator, Applicant
stated that he used marijuana between June 2012 and December 2018. He estimated
using  marijuana  10  times  between  2015  and  2018  while  possessing  a  security
clearance. He used marijuana for recreational and experimental reasons. He claimed he
has  never  purchased  marijuana.  He  used  marijuana  with  a  long-time  friend  that
provided  the  marijuana.  Applicant  continued  to  associate  with  his  marijuana-using
friend. During his 2020 interview, Applicant told the investigator that he did not intend to
use marijuana in the future. Applicant presented no documentary evidence to show that
he  sought  or  received  any  medical  or  psychological  treatment  or  counseling  for
substance abuse.
