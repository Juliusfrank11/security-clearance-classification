In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  she  denied  the  SOR  allegation  in  ¶  1.a  with
explanations. (HE 3) She also provided some admissions. Her admissions are accepted
as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant is 46  years old,  and  a  government contractor has employed  her as a  real
property  subject-matter expert and  trainer. (Tr. 16-17)  She  has worked  either as  a  federal
employee  or federal contractor with  some  breaks in  employment  for the  last  nine  years.
(Tr. 53) In  2007, she  received  a  bachelor’s degree  in history  at a  university  in state  A. (Tr.
18) She  worked  in interior design  and  space  planning  for 13  years. (Tr. 19)  She  has  never
been  married, and  she  does not have  any  children. (Tr. 51) She  has  never served  in the
military. (Tr. 51)
Financial Considerations
Applicant  was  unemployed  in  2010,  employed  in  2011,  unemployed  in  2012,
employed  from  2013  to  mid-2016,  unemployed  from  mid-2016  to  mid-2017,  and
employed  thereafter  to  the  present.  (Tr.  49-50)  She  has  also  been  underemployed  at
times. (Tr. 49-50) Her annual income over the past four years has ranged from $65,000
to $120,000. (Tr. 53) Her current income is $102,000. (Tr. 53) Her current net worth, which
includes her retirement accounts, is approximately $40,000. (Tr. 99)
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  Applicant  has  a  delinquent  student  loan  for  $81,495.
Applicant disclosed her student loan debt on her February 7, 2019 SCA and during her
April 3, 2019, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview. (GE 1,
GE 5)
From 1998 to 2002, Applicant obtained five student loans from a state A entity. (Tr.
23, 27-28, 44; GE 2 at 2-4, 7-15) The interest rate on her promissory notes was eight to
nine percent. (Tr. 28-32) The creditor has provided the following balances:

The total balance in June 2016 was $43,877. (GE 2 at 7-15) On August 22, 2016,
the creditor emailed Applicant and indicated the amounts owed in column (4), and the
total balance was $60,782. (AE H) On September 12, 2018, the creditor wrote that the
balance owed was $81,495. (GE 2 at 1) The June 2016 printout of the “current balance”
in  column  (3)  does  not  explain  the  various  columns  of  figures.  (GE  2  at  7-15)  The
documentation does not explain why the balance increased $37,618 in 28 months from
June 2016 to September 2018.
Applicant said she  made  her first payments in 2010 because she  may have had a
deferment for unemployment or taking  classes from  her graduation  in  2007  to  2010.  (Tr.
33)  She   understood   that  her  debt  was  accruing   interest   while   she   was  in  school  and
during the  deferment. (Tr. 33-34)
Applicant said she disputed the debt because the creditor said she owes five times
the amount she borrowed. (Tr. 21)  Around 2012, a collection agent contacted her and
asked her to pay about $40,000. (Tr. 39) She said she borrowed $21,000 and her first bill
“was close  to  $40,000.” (Tr. 34) Her monthly payment was about $400, and she made
about four payments. (Tr. 36) She stopped making payments because she had a period
of unemployment. (Tr. 36) She did not make any payments after 2010 until 2016 when
her pay was garnished for about two months. (Tr. 38-39) The garnishment was 25 percent
of  her  wages.  (Tr.  47)  In  2016,  Applicant  emailed  the  original  creditor  asking  for  an
income-based  repayment plan; and  the  creditor replied  that this was  a federal student
loan program that is unavailable because her loan is a state loan. (AE E) The creditor
suggested that she provide evidence of financial hardship or extenuating circumstances
if she wished to have relief from the garnishment of her pay. (Id.)
In 2018, Applicant filed a complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(CFPB) asserting that the original creditor has refused to allow her to pay off each of her
five loans individually. (AE F) The CFPB responded that they had no jurisdiction over non-
federal student loans. (AE G)
Applicant  believes  the interest  on  her student  loan  might  be  compounding on  a
daily basis. (Tr. 37) She did not believe state A could garnish her pay outside of state A;
however, she believed that if she moved back to state A, the creditor would attempt to
garnish her wages. (Tr. 38) She has not made any payments since the garnishment in
2016. (Tr. 46-47) When the garnishment occurred in 2016, she was working for a state A
company, but she was living and working on an island in the Pacific Ocean. (Tr. 38-39)
Applicant said she has not heard from the creditor since 2016 or 2017. (Tr. 22) In
2018, she retained a consumer counsel, Mr. C, to negotiate resolution of the debt. (Tr.
21, 40) On February 24, 2020, Mr. C wrote:
Between  August  16, 2018  [and]  September 12,  2018,  we  made  numerous
attempts  to   contact  [the   original  creditor  and   the   collection   agent]   for  the
sole  purpose   of  satisfying   the   alleged   outstanding   debt  in   a   mutually
beneficial  manner  based   on   verifiable  and   legally   based   information   and
details.  . . .  Between  August 16, 2018  and  September  12, 2018, our  office
made  numerous written  and  phone  demands  to  both  [the  original creditor
and the collection agent] to  provide an accurate and detailed accounting of
the  account at issue  prior to  resolving  the  account  in satisfaction.  However,
such   an   accounting   was  never  provided   even   as  numerous  follow   up
requests for this information  was made by  our office. Based  on  information
provided   to   our  office  by   [Applicant],   we   believe   the   amount  in  question,
$81,494.91   is  not  an   accurate   balance,  and   is  not  owed   by   [Applicant].
Neither entity  could or would provide  any  details to  our office to  reconcile
nor verify  the  amount  at issue. Therefore we  could  not in  good  consci[ence]
or practice advise our client to  pay  a  debt  that a  creditor refused  to  verify
through a reasonable accounting of  the  account request. (AE D at 1-2)
Mr. C stated that reasonable offers to settle were made to the collection agent, and
they  were  rejected.  (Id.  at  2)  The  creditor  did  not  provide  “a  verifiable  accounting  or
provide a complete chain of ownership title of the alleged debt.” (Id.) Mr. C concluded that
she  had  an  excellent defense  to  the  debt  due  to  the  applicability  of  the  state  B’s statute
of  limitations, and  she  does not owe  the  claimed  amount of  $81,494.91  to  the  creditor.
(Id.) Mr. C  did not provide any written correspondence  to  or from the creditor.
Mr.  C   recommended   that  Applicant  not  make   a   partial  payment.   (Tr.  21-22)  In
2018, the creditor wrote  Mr. C  and informed him that she  owed $81,495. (Tr. 44; GE 2 at
1)  The   handwritten   notes  on   the   creditor’s  letter  to   Mr.  C   were  made   by   an   unknown
person  and  will not be  considered. (Tr. 46;  GE  2  at 1) In  2018,  the  SOR debt was dropped
from  Applicant’s credit report. (Tr. 20)  She  instructed  Mr. C  to  approach  the  creditor and
negotiate  a  settlement.  (Tr. 24) However, Mr. C  never wrote  the  creditor to  make  an  offer
to  settle the  debt. (Tr. 48) The  last  time  she  asked   Mr. C  about whether he  had  heard
from  the  creditor was in 2020,  and  Mr. C  said  he  had  not heard from  the  creditor. (Tr. 49)
There  is  no   evidence   that  Mr.  C   informed   the   SOR  ¶   1.a   creditor  of   the   address  of
Appellant’s current employer.
Applicant’s rough estimate of the current amount of the debt is about $60,000 to
$65,000. (Tr. 45-46, 50) She knows how to use a spreadsheet; however, she elected not
to use one to determine the amount of her debt. (Tr. 51) She believed that the creditor
would garnish 25 percent of her pay if she moved back to state A; however, she did not
believe the debt could be collected in state B. (Tr. 38)
An expert on student loan collection actions wrote:
Administrative  wage  garnishment  is  special  and  unique.  The  Higher
Education Act (20 U.S.C. § 1095a) in combination with the Debt Collection
Improvement Act of 1991 (31 U.S.C. § 3720D), allow wages to be garnished
for default Federal student loans. However, the loan at issue is not a Federal
loan, and thus Federal law does not apply, nor allow for an administrative
wage garnishment.
Unfortunately,  [state  A]  is  unique  in  that  its  legislature  also  allows  for
administrative wage garnishment, pursuant to [state A statute], more fully
described in [state A statute] - Order to Withhold and Deliver. However, the
law of [state A] regarding administrative remedies stops at its  borders for
the exact reason pointed out by Administrative Judge Harvey- the Full Faith
and  Credit  Clause  of  the  US  Constitution  only  applies  to  judgments,  not
administrative remedies.
In  essence,  while  a  judicial  garnishment  could  cross  state  lines,  time  is
limited in pursuing someone to obtain a judgment. Administrative remedies
may not have a time clock, but they are limited in geography to the state
which enacts such. This is a warning to [Applicant]. Should she ever return
to [state A], the state could start garnishing her wages, regardless how long
it has been since she last paid the loan. But, while she remains in [state B]
or any other state other than [state A], [state A] has no power to reach her
through administrative wage garnishment.
NOTE:  Should  [Applicant’s]  employer  have  locations  in  [state  A],  the
administrative remedy could be enforced against the [state A] location. This
is  not  [state  A]  reaching  into  [state  B].  It  is [state  A]  reaching a  business
subject to [state A] law, that happens to employ [state B] resident. (AE L)
Department Counsel counters  that  Applicant’s provides no  authorities in  state  B
indicating an administrative garnishment from state A would not be enforceable in state
B, and  that  Applicant’s  company  might open  an  office in  state  A.  (GE 6) Theoretically,
state A could use an administrative garnishment to obtain a judicial garnishment order in
state A’ courts. For the purposes of this decision, I will presume that state A will not file
an administrative or judicial garnishment of Applicant’s pay with her employer.
Applicant is current on all of her debts, including her federal student loans, except
for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a. (Tr. 23-24) Her 2021 credit reports do not contain any negative
entries. (AE A-AE C) She did not describe any financial counseling or provide a budget.
Applicant made two trips to Thailand and one trip to Europe over the last seven years for
vacations. (Tr. 41-42) Her goal in 2022 is to stay current on her debts and to pay down
her debts. (Tr. 52) Security is aware of  the debt, and she does not believe it could be
used to pressure or compromise her. (Tr. 25)
Applicant’s counsel argued  it is legal malpractice  for an  attorney to suggest that
Applicant  make  a  payment  to  the  creditor.  (Tr.  107-108,  111-112)  He  contended  that
prudent legal advice is to wait for the creditor to file a lawsuit because “that’s never going
to happen.” (Tr. 107, 111) Her counsel described the student loan as a “usurious loan.”
(Tr.  109)  He  recommended  against  her  taking  money  from  her  retirement  account  to
attempt to settle the SOR ¶ 1.a debt. (Tr. 113)
Character Evidence
Applicant loves her employment,  helping  people,  and  assisting  the  Army. (Tr. 25,
53) She  loves the  United  States  and  would  not take  any  actions  to  jeopardize  security.
(Tr. 26, 100)
Applicant  received  a  three  percent  merit  pay  increase  in  2019,  and  she  was
awarded  a  certificate of  appreciation  from  the  commander of  an  important  installation.
(AE J; AE K) The certificate of appreciation lauded her outstanding work and exceptional
contributions to mission accomplishment during October 2021. (AE K)
Seven  character witnesses  including family,  coworkers,  a  former employer,  and
friends made statements on Applicant’s behalf. Her sister and best friend said Applicant
expressed  frustration  to  her  about  the  creditor  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.  (Tr.  57-58)  Applicant’s
brother-in-law, her sister, and a friend are aware of her disputing for several years her
responsibility  for  repaying  her  student  loan.  (Tr.  58,  65,  72) Applicant  is  conscientious
about paying her debts. (Tr. 58, 65) She is passionate about her work and family. (Tr. 59)
The general sense of their statements is that Applicant has excellent integrity, and is detail
oriented, diligent, trustworthy, responsible, professional, honest, and reliable. (Tr. 56-98)
She  made  important  contributions  to  mission  accomplishment.  (Tr.  56-98)  Their
statements support approval of her access to classified information. (Tr. 56-98)
