Applicant admitted the sole SOR allegation. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 59 years old. She married in 1983 and divorced in 1995. She has two
adult children from the marriage. She remarried in 1998 and has an adult child from the
marriage.  She  has  worked  for  a  federal  contractor  since  1999  and  held  a  security
clearance since 2006.
In her December 2017 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed
that she failed to timely file her 2015 and 2016 federal and state income tax returns. She
stated in the SCA: “Had brain tumor/surgery in February 2017, returned to work Oct 2017,
working on filing.” She also stated: “Spoke with IRS, will complete NLT December 2017,
most likely a refund.” (Item 3)
Applicant responded to government interrogatories in April 2019. She provided IRS
transcripts for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017. Her 2015 federal income tax return was
filed in July 2018; 2016 federal income tax return filed in April 2019; and 2017 federal
income tax return filed in April 2019. She was entitled to refunds each year and there is
no balance owed for these years. (Item 4)
During Applicant’s July 2018 background interview with a government investigator,
she explained that she failed to timely file her income tax returns because she had a brain
tumor that eventually led to brain surgery in February 2017. Her condition made her tired.
She was aware she would be receiving a tax refund so she was lazy about timely filing
the returns. (Item 5)
In Applicant’s June 2020 answer to the SOR she stated:
My  sincere apologies for not  taking  care of this sooner. I  thought I remedied
this issue  last  year, but  this action  has made  me  aware that the  problem  still
exists. I immediately  made  copies of  my  State  taxes, and  resent it  by  mail.
I understand  the  importance  of  having  my  security  clearance, and  how  not
having  it will affect my  job  and  lively  hood  (sic). Please  be  assured,  that I
will not let this happen  in the  future. (Item 2)
Initially, Applicant failed to provide documents to substantiate that her state income
taxes  for  2015  through  2017  were  filed.  After  I  reopened  the  record,  she  provided  a
document  from  her  state  substantiating  a  zero  balance  owed  as  of  December  2020.
Although  this document  does  not  specifically  address  tax  years  2015  to  2017,  I  found
Applicant’s statement credible and believe she resent the required tax documents to her
state. I am satisfied that she is current on her state taxes. (AE A)
