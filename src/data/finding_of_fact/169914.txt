Applicant is a  43-year-old  single man  with  an  eight-year-old child. He   was married
to  his third  wife  from  2009  to  2020. The  marriage  ended  in  divorce.  (Tr. 25)  Applicant  is a
U.S. Army  veteran, serving  from  1996  to  2009. He was discharged  honorably. His Army
service  included  five   tours of  duty   in  combat   zones.  (Tr. 27) Since   2020, he   has   been
working  for a  defense  contractor as   a  support engineer. (Tr.  27)  His job  duties  include
modeling  simulations for radio transmitters. (Tr. 28)  He has earned  an  associate  degree
and  a bachelor’s degree, and  he is currently  pursuing  a master’s degree.
In  February  2019,  Applicant received  a  job  offer from  his previous employer. (GE
6) The  employer hired  him, in  part, based  upon  his credentials listed  on  his résumé  and
his  social  media  LinkedIn   account,  including   a   “Ph.D.”   of   electrical  and   computer
engineering  earned  in 2009, a  master’s of  engineering  earned  in 2012, a  bachelor’s  of
science  earned  in 2009,  and  a  bachelor’s of  computer engineering  earned  in 2011. (GE
6  at 9; GE  5  at 3) During  the  onboarding  process, the  company’s human  resources officer
contacted  Applicant  to  ask about his college  major, which was not listed  on  his résumé.
(GE  6   at  13)  The   human   resources  officer   also  asked   him   why   his  security   clearance
application   (SCA)  did  not  include   the   advanced   degrees  listed   on   the   résumé.  (GE   4)
Applicant  informed  the  human  resources officer that he  majored  in  math  and  minored  in
physics from  the  college  from which he  graduated  in  2009.  (GE 6  at 14)  Also,  Applicant
said he  would supplement his SCA with  the  additional information  and  provide  a  college
transcript the  next day.  (GE 6  at  15)  Applicant did  not provide  the  promised  information.
Instead, he  never returned  to  work, and  resigned  from  the  employment  three  days later.
(GE 4)
Applicant gained another job in May 2018. He submitted the same résumé that he
had submitted to his previous employer. (GE 5 at 3) He did not list the previous employer
in the employment history section of the résumé submitted to the new employer. (GE 5
at 4-5)
In  response  to  interrogatories  from  DOHA  in  January  2020,  Applicant  denied
receiving the degrees that he had listed on his résumé.  (GE 3 at 3) When asked on cross
examination  about  the  discrepancy,  Applicant  denied  intentionally  embellishing  his
résumé, contending instead that the online company that prepared his résumé mistakenly
included  this  information  without  his  knowledge.  (Tr.  47)  Yet  when  Applicant  initially
responded to the human resources officer’s email in February 2019 regarding the resume,
he used the title, “Ph.D.” after his name in the email signature block. (GE 6 at 13)
Applicant stated on his April 2018 SCA that he earned a master’s degree in 2014,
when,  in  fact,  no  degree  was  granted  to  him  that  year.  When  asked  about  the  false
information, Applicant testified that he made a mistake, and that he meant to indicate that
2014 was the last date that he had taken a class at the university.  (Tr. 62) Applicant’s
submission of embellished résumés and erroneous information on his SCA prompted the
Government  to  allege that he  intentionally falsified this information, as  alleged  in  SOR
subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c.
In 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with first degree burglary, a felony.
The charge was later dismissed. (GE 7 at 6) In 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged
with  driving  while  impaired.  Subsequently,  he  was  convicted  of  the  lesser  offense  of
reckless driving to endanger. (GE 9) In 2007, Applicant was charged and subsequently
convicted of driving under the influence. (GE 7 at 4) In 2009, Applicant was charged with
the  felony  of  failing  to  return  a  rental  car.  (GE  7  at  7)  The  charge  was  subsequently
dismissed.
Applicant failed  to  list any of  these  arrests, charges,  or convictions  on  his  2018
security  clearance  application.  He  explained  that  he  thought  criminal  activity  was  not
required to be listed if it occurred more than ten years before the completion of the security
clearance application. (Tr. 77) The security clearance application requires applicants to
disclose  felony  charges  or  alcohol-related  charges,  regardless  of  when  they  occurred.
(GE 1 at 38)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  problems.  In  2001,  he  filed  for  Chapter  13
bankruptcy protection. (GE 15) He later converted the case to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy,
whereupon the debt covered by that bankruptcy was discharged in May 2002. (GE 14)
The amount of debt is unknown from the record.
In 2016, Applicant’s student loan accounts, totaling approximately $86,000, came
out of deferment. (Tr. 90) The following year, the IRS conducted a random audit, which
concluded that he owed an additional $19,043 in income taxes for tax year 2014.
In   October  2017,  Applicant  filed   for  Chapter  13   bankruptcy   protection,  which
included  the  2014  tax  debt, in addition  to  student  loans  of  approximately  $80,000. (GE at
7)  In  September 2021,  Applicant  obtained  a  modification  of the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy
plan  to  include  tax  debts for  2017  and  2018.  (GE  18  at  3)  The  total amount  to  be  paid  in
his Chapter 13  bankruptcy  is $84,142, and  Applicant is to  satisfy  the  plan  in  60  months.
(GE 3  at 3)  He has been  making  payments since  December 2018. (GE  3  at 13)  Currently,
the  balance of his delinquent federal tax debt totals approximately $30,000. (GE 18 at 3)
The SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his 2018 SCA  when he did not disclose
the tax debt owed from 2014 in response to Section 26. Applicant contends that he did
not  falsify  Section  26.  Specifically,  he  filed  a  tax  return  in  2014  that  proved  to  be
inaccurate  per an  audit  in  2017,  which  determined  that  he  owed more money than he
originally paid. (Tr. 55)
