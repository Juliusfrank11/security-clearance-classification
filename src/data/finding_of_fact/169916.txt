Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $18,386 for 23
delinquent or past-due medical debts (SOR 1.a – 1.w), and that she owed $16,969 for the
delinquent remainder after a car repossession (SOR 1.x). The Government also alleged
that Applicant did not timely file her federal income tax returns for the 2008 through 2016
tax  years  (SOR  1.y).  In  her  response  to  the  SOR  (Answer),  Applicant  denied  with
explanations all of the SOR allegations.
In her Answer, Applicant claimed that the debts alleged at SOR 1.b, 1.c, 1.e – 1.j,
and 1.t had been paid or otherwise resolved. In support of these responses, she included
documents supporting her claims, but only as to SOR 1.c and 1.e. Regarding SOR 1.g –
1.j, Applicant averred that those debts were paid by her attorney. In support of this claim,
she  provided  information  documenting  a  lawsuit  settlement  whereby  her  debts  to  a
medical facility totaling $35,700 were resolved  through a single payment of $15,000  in
October 2017. Applicant denied the allegations at SOR 1.a, 1.d, 1.k – 1.p, 1.r, 1.s, 1.u,
and  1.v,  stating  that  she  was  “unfamiliar”  with  those  accounts  and  did  not  have  any
information  about  them.  (Answer)  In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by  Applicant’s
admissions, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 37 years old and has been sponsored for a security clearance by a
defense  contractor  for  whom  she  will  work  if  her  request  for  a  clearance  is  granted.
Applicant attended a state university between 2003 and 2008 but did not earn a degree.
She then studied at a technical training school to be a medical assistant between October
and December 2012, but did not complete those studies either. Starting in March 2018,
Applicant studied for a degree in intelligence studies, which she received in December
2021. (GX 1; GX 4; AX H)
Between January 2008 and April 2009, Applicant worked as a restaurant server
and as an optometry technician. Between April 2009 and July 2012, she worked as an
assistant in a business run by her boyfriend. She left that job when they broke up. For the
next five months, she worked as a certified medical assistant but left that job when she
became sick and required surgery in November 2012. Applicant’s illness was a condition
she first developed around 2000 and for which she has had multiple surgeries starting in
2002.  Applicant  was  unemployed  between  January  and  April  2013,  after  which  she
started  working  at  an  environmental  engineering  company  owned  by  her  father.  She
worked there until January 2016, but she claims she received no pay. Instead, she claims
her father paid for her room and board and other expenses, including her medical bills.
(Answer; GX 1; GX 4; AX E; Tr. 43 – 45, 85 – 89)
In   January   2016,  Applicant  started   working   as  an   executive   assistant  with   a
company   in  the   healthcare  industry.  On   May   17,   2016,  she  and   her boss  were  driving
from  a  business meeting  when  they  were involved  in a  car accident that left Applicant with
injuries  to   her arm,   shoulder,   and   neck.   Having   no   medical   insurance,   her   subsequent
medical  expenses   totaled   at   least  $35,000,   but  were  resolved   for  $15,000   from   the
proceeds  of   a   settlement  she   received   in   November  2017.  That  settlement  totaled
$100,000, of which Applicant received  $60,000  in November 2017  after medical expenses
and  legal fees.  Since  May  2016,  Applicant has supported  herself  using  those  settlement
proceeds  and  whatever savings she  had  at the  time  of  the  accident.  She  currently  spends
about  $2,000   each   month   for  rent  and   other  basic  expenses,  and   financed   her
undergraduate   studies   through   student   loans   that  included   money   for  living   expenses.
Applicant estimates that she will owe a total  of  $46,000  for those loans when they are no
longer in deferment  or forbearance. At a  monthly  expense  rate  of  $2,000  since  November
2017, Applicant would have  spent $96,000  by  November 2021. She  did not present any
current financial information  and acknowledged  that she  has not earned  income through
regular employment  since  2018.  (Answer; GX  1; GX  2; AX  D;  Tr. 59  –  63, 86  –  89,  93  -
95)
In her e-QIP, Applicant did not disclose any adverse financial information. At the
outset of the ensuing background investigation, a credit report obtained by investigators
on  November  2,  2019,  documented  the  debts  alleged  at  SOR  1.a  –  1.x.  Applicant
subsequently discussed those debts with a government investigator during  her PSI on
November 27, 2019. A credit report obtained by the government on March 26, 2021, did
not reflect any past-due or delinquent debts attributable to Applicant. (GX 1 – 4)
As alleged at SOR 1.x, Applicant’s vehicle was repossessed for failure to make the
necessary payments on the loan she obtained to pay for the car. In her December 4, 2019
PSI, Applicant averred that the vehicle was repossessed while she was in the hospital in
November 2012; but she also has claimed her father (who died in December 2018) sold
the car and paid off  the balance owed. Further,  she has claimed she made  a $10,000
down payment on the vehicle and was making $1,000 monthly payments, well in excess
of  the payments required by the terms of the loan, reducing the loan balance  to about
$1,000 before she was hospitalized in 2012. However, Applicant’s claims in this regard
conflict  with  information  showing  that  in  November  2019,  the  balance  was  $16,969.
Applicant has not produced any corroboration for her assertion that she had nearly paid
off the loan or that any remaining debt had been resolved. This debt does not appear on
the most recent available credit report, but there is no indication in the record as to why.
(Answer; GX 2; GX 4; Tr. 47 – 48, 77 – 79, 98 – 101)
As alleged in SOR 1.y, Applicant did not file federal or state income tax returns for
the  tax  years  2008  through  2016.  Applicant  denied  the  SOR  allegation;  however,  she
stated in her PSI and at her hearing that she had not filed for those years.  A review of
IRS regulations for individual filing requirements (see 26 U.S.C. § 6012) suggests that
between 2008 and 2016, the minimum annual income required to trigger a filing obligation
likely was less than $7,000. That figure was raised in 2017 to $12,950 to coincide with
major revisions to the U.S. tax code that year. Applicant has acknowledged that she made
more than $10,000 in 2012 and should have filed an income tax return for that year. She
believes  her father  may  have  filed  that  return  for her  while  she  was  receiving  medical
treatment in late 2012 and early 2013. In support of her claim that she was not required
to  file  returns  for  the  years  alleged  in  SOR  1.y,  Applicant  submitted  a  self-generated
statement regarding her non-filing of returns in 2019 or 2020. With that statement, she
provided various unsigned IRS forms pertaining to her receipt of tuition assistance and
estimated taxes for 2021. None of this information supports her claims about why she did
not file her taxes between 2008 and 2016. (Answer; GX 4; AX C; Tr. 48 – 50, 65 – 77,
101 - 103)
