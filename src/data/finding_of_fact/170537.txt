In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  allegations,  with
explanations.  I  have  incorporated  those  admissions  into  my  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make
the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  52   years  old.   He   has   a   high   school  diploma  and   two   years  of
technical school.  He has been married  four times (to wife  1 (W1): 1995-2014; W2: 2015-
2016; W3: 2017-2021;  W4: 2021  to  present).  He has two  children  and  two  stepchildren.
He has worked  for a  defense  contractor  as a  database  administrator  since  June  2019.
He served  in the  U.S. Army  for two  years and  received  an  honorable discharge  due  to
medical  reasons.   He   has  never  held  a   security   clearance.   He   completed   his   security
clearance application (SCA) in  July  2019.  (Tr. 6, 15-18; GE  1)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant:  purchased  marijuana  from  December 2018  to  about
May   2019;   used   marijuana,  with   varying   frequency,   from   2012   to   May   2019;  used
mushrooms in December 2018; and  used  ecstasy  in August 2018.  (See  SOR ¶¶  1.a  -
1.d.)
Applicant credibly  testified  that his marijuana  use  was very  limited. When  he  was
17  years old,  his first exposure to  marijuana  was when  a  girl blew marijuana  smoke  in
his face.  He did  not ask her  to  do  it  at the  time. His only  other uses  of  marijuana  were in
approximately   2017   when   he   inhaled   it  from   an   e-pen   (device  used   for   smoking
marijuana), inhaled  it from  a  joint, ate  a  pastry  laced  with  marijuana, and  ate  marijuana
gummy   bears  on   two   occasions.  All   these   uses  occurred   in  2017,   when   he   was  living
with  W3  and  used  it  at  her urging. They  also  occurred  when  they  lived  in a  state  which
legalized   marijuana   use   under   state   law.  At   the   time   of  these   uses,  Applicant   did   not
have  a  security  clearance, or any  affiliation  with  a  defense  contractor. He has  not used
marijuana  since  beginning  to  work for his current employer. He voluntarily  disclosed  his
marijuana  use  to  a  defense  investigator when  interviewed  in September 2019. (Tr. 20-
23;  GE 2)
Applicant credibly testified that he purchased marijuana from December 2018 to
May  2019  as  gifts  to  W3.  She  is  approximately  12  years  younger  than  Applicant  and
was  very  involved  in  using  marijuana.  He  was  trying  to  make  her  happy  and  believed
that  his  purchases  of  marijuana  as  gifts  might  help  that  cause.  His  purchases  were
made at state-legalized marijuana dispensaries. Applicant and W3 separated in August
2019. He has not purchased marijuana since their separation and has no intention to do
so.  He  has  no  further  contact  with  her  other  than  to  pay  spousal  support  from  the
divorce.  He  provided  a  signed  sworn  statement  indicating  his  intent  not  to  use  or
possess  illegal  drugs  in  the  future  (he  understands  marijuana  is  illegal  under  federal
law) when he completed interrogatories sent to him by DOHA. (Tr. 18-19, 25, 28; GE 2)
When   completing   the   DOHA  interrogatories,  Applicant  also  disclosed   his  one-
time  use  of  psychedelic mushrooms (December 2018) and  ecstasy  (August 2018). He
testified   that he  used   these   drugs  while   on   vacation   and  on   his birthday   when   he   was
with  W3.  He has  not used  them  since  and  has no  intention  to  do  so. He  did  not  hold  a
security  clearance  nor  work for a  defense  contractor  at  the  time  of  these  uses.  (Tr.  26-
27; GE 2)
