Applicant denied all the SOR allegations with explanations. After a review of the
pleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 61-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began  working
for his  current  employer  in  March  2015.  From  1994  to  2015, he  worked for a different
defense contractor before he was laid off in February 2015. He is a contract specialist.
He  has  held  a  security  clearance  for  38  years.  His  higher  education  includes  an
associate’s,  a  bachelor’s,  and  two  master’s  degrees.  He  is  married  (since  1993)  and
has one adult daughter. (Tr. at 6, 20, 22-23, 25; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  failed  to  timely  pay  his  2016-2019  federal  and
state taxes, and that he failed to timely file his 2017-2019 federal and state tax returns.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d).
While  Applicant  denied  the  allegations  in  his  SOR  answer,  he  previously
admitted  the  allegations  in  his  2020  SCA.  Specifically,  he  admitted  that  he  failed  to
timely file his 2016-2019 federal and state tax returns and that he failed to pay the taxes
owed  for  each  of  those  years  to  both  the  state  and  the  federal  governments.  He
confirmed  these  admissions  about  his  tax  delinquencies  when  he  spoke  to  a  defense
investigator  in  May 2020  during his background  investigation.  Applicant  explained  that
he failed to file his 2016 returns because he was required to provide documentation to
support his health savings account (HSA) deductions and he claimed he could not find
the  paperwork so  he  did not  file  that  year’s return. This led  to  a  snowball  effect on  his
2017-2019  returns,  which  he  did  not  timely  file  because  he  had  not  filed  his  2016
returns.  At  that  time,  he  was  preparing  his  taxes  himself  without  professional
assistance. He also stated that he did not give the time and priority to working his taxes.
He  rationalized  that because  he  was  having  taxes  withheld from his paycheck he was
satisfying  his  tax  requirement  even  if  he  was  not  filing  his  returns  on  time.  (Tr. 22-23,
28; GE 1-2)
Applicant claims he began working with a tax preparation firm (TPF) in December
2020  to  resolve  his  tax  problems.  He  provided  documentation  for  some  of  the  results
from his work with  the TPF, but  several questions  remain open. He  testified  that all of
his 2016-2019 federal and state tax return were filed. However, he failed to provide any
documentation  of  the  filing  of  those  returns,  either  by  providing  copies  of  the  actual
returns or by providing tax transcripts from the IRS or state tax authority. (Tr. 21; AE A)
He provided the following:
(1)  a   receipt  from   his  state   tax   authority   showing   that  on   January   22,  2022,   he   paid
$11,407  toward his 2018  state  tax  debt.  (See  AE  A,  attachment  B-1, Ex. 2)  (There  is no
information  about whether this amount paid satisfied  the entire debt);
(2)  a   receipt  from   his  state   tax   authority   showing   that  on   January   26,  2022,   he   paid
$1,733  toward his  2021  state  tax  debt.  (This debt  was not alleged  in  the  SOR) (See  AE
A, attachment B-1, Ex. 3);
(3)  a   receipt   from   the   IRS   showing   that  on   July   23,  2021,  he   paid   $5,541   toward  his
2016  federal  tax  debt.  (See  AE  A, attachment  B-2,  Ex. 1)  (There is no  information  about
whether this amount paid satisfied the  entire debt);
(4)  a   receipt   from   the   IRS   showing   that  on   July   23,  2021,   he   paid  $20,318   toward  his
2017  federal  tax  debt.  (See  AE  A, attachment  B-2,  Ex. 2)  (There is no  information  about
whether this amount paid satisfied the  entire debt);
(5)  a   receipt   from   the   IRS   showing   that  on   December  14,  2021   (one   day   before  his
security  clearance  hearing), he  paid $13,290  toward his 2018  federal tax  debt.  (See  AE
A,  attachment  B-2,  Ex.  3)   (There  is  no   information   about  whether  this  amount  paid
satisfied  the entire debt);
(6)  a   receipt   from   the   IRS   showing   that  on   December   14,  2021   (one   day   before  his
security  clearance  hearing), he  paid $13,835  toward his 2019  federal tax  debt.  (See  AE
A,  attachment  B-2,  Ex.  4)   (There  is  no   information   about  whether  this  amount  paid
satisfied  the entire debt).
Applicant’s documentation showed that as of January 22, 2022, he had not timely
filed his 2020 federal or state tax return, due on or before April 15, 2021. This tax filing
delinquency  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  and  I  will  not  consider  it  for  disqualification
purposes, but I may consider it to assess Applicant’s credibility, in the application of any
mitigating conditions, and  in  considering the whole-person factors. The  documentation
also shows that Applicant intended to hire the TPF to prepare and file his 2021 federal
and  state  tax  returns.  However,  this  information  conflicted  with  his  hearing  testimony
where  he  stated  that  he  intended  to  prepare  his  own  taxes  because  he  did  not  need
assistance  from  tax  professionals.  The  large  tax  payments  that  Applicant  made,  as
noted above, came from funds in his retirement accounts. (Tr. 36, 38; AE A, attachment
C)
Applicant  also  presented  two  written  character  recommendations  from  work
supervisors.  They  expressed  their  belief  that  Applicant  is  a  trusted  employee  and  a
valuable team member. Applicant also documented his active civic involvement, which
included: receiving  The  President’s Volunteer Service Award,  recognition for ten years
of  service  to  Junior  Achievement,  and  participating  in  the  American  Heart  Savior
program as CPR qualified. (AE A, attachment B-3)
Applicant  testified  that  his  financial  assets  included  a  $700,000  home  that  was
nearly completely paid for and a retirement account valued at approximately $100,000.
