Applicant  is  a  40-year-old  mechanic  for  a  defense  contractor  who  seeks  a
security clearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted as relevant
and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant  married  in  August  2002  and  divorced  in  September  2011.  (GE  1)  He
has two children from this marriage (ages 19 and 18). He remarried in June 2013 and
divorced  in  March  2017.  (GE  1)  He  has  no  children  from  his  most  recent  marriage.
Applicant attended college classes between August 2009 and August 2010 but did not
earn a degree or diploma. (GE 1) He enlisted in the Air Force in July 2000 and served
four years of active duty before receiving an honorable discharge in July 2006. (GE 1)
Between August 2017 and December 2021, Applicant was employed by his last
reported employer, who sponsored him for his security clearance. (GE 1 and AE E; Tr.
28)  In   a   post-hearing   submission   in  December  2021,   he   reported   he   has  resigned   his
position   and   no   longer  requires  a   security   clearance.  (AE   E)   Previously,  he   was
employed  by  other employers in various positions. He  has held  a  security  position  while
employed by his last-reported employer of record.
Applicant’s finances
Between  2014  and  2017,  Applicant  accumulated  11  delinquent  medical  and
consumer  debts  (including  an  adverse  judgment  obtained  by  SOR  creditor  1.j  in
October  2017  for  $13,578)  exceeding  $33,000.  (GEs  2-6;  Tr.  16-20,  40)  He  attributed
his debt delinquencies to a difficult divorce from his second wife in March 2017 and poor
financial decisions. (Tr. 30-31)
To  date,  Applicant  has  made  little  progress  in  resolving  his  debt  delinquencies.
More  specifically,  he  has  been  unable  to  document  any  of  his  listed  SOR  debts  with
voluntary  payments.  While  one  of  the  listed  SOR  debts  (a  $13,578  adverse  judgment
entered  against  Applicant  in  June  2018  and  covered  by  SOR  ¶  1.j)  appears  to  have
been reduced by a combination of garnishment and voluntary means  (GE 6; Tr. 25-26,
37),  the  judgment  debt  remains  unsatisfied  without  any  evidence  of  recent  efforts  by
Applicant to satisfy the balance.
Based   on   the   documentation   in  evidence,  none   of  Applicant’s  remaining   debts
covered   by   SOR  ¶¶   1.a-1.i  and   1.k  have   been   addressed   and   paid,   or  otherwise
satisfied  by  other voluntary  means. (GEs 2-5; Tr. 21-22, 31-34) Neither Applicant’s pre-
hearing   or  hearing   claims  to   have   satisfied   most  of   the   listed   SOR  debts   nor  his
promises  to  do  so,  are  enough  to  credit him  with  resolving  his debt  delinquencies.  One
of  Applicant’s small   debts (notably  SOR ¶  1.g), he  could  not identify. (Tr. 36-37) Other
previously delinquent debts were discharged  in  bankruptcy in 2007. (Tr. 43)
Afforded  post-hearing  opportunities  to  address  his  delinquent  medical  and
consumer  debts  with  documented  payments  and  payment  plans,  Applicant  did  not
provide  any  documentation  of  resolving  his  listed  SOR  debts.  He  earned  $65,000  in
calendar year 2021 from his listed employment and owns a metal fabrication business
that nets him an additional $6,600 a year. (Tr. 68-69)
Monthly  child  support  payments  to  his  first  spouse  for  his  youngest  child  totals
$103 a month and are current. His other monthly expenses exceed $3,000, which leave
him  with  a  monthly  remainder  in  the  range  of  $1,500  to  $1,800.  (Tr.  38-39,  41-42)
Applicant  has  a  savings  account  of  around  $1,000  and  a  modest  401(k)  retirement
account.  (Tr.  42-43)  He  claims  an  improved  credit  score  as  evidence  of  his  making
progress with his debts. (Tr. 77)
Character references
Applicant  is  held  in  high  regard  by  his  coworkers  who  hold  security  clearances
themselves,  but  only  one  of  his  coworkers  expressed  any  awareness  of  the  financial
issues affecting his security clearance. (AE B) All of his references credit Applicant with
integrity,  good  judgment,  reliability,  and  strong  moral  ethics.  Each  of  his  character
references  considers  him  to  be  worthy  of  holding  a  security  clearance  or  position  of
trust.
