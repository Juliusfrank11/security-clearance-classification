Applicant  is   a   30-year-old   employee   of   a   defense   contractor   for  whom   he   has
worked   since   May   2020.  He  served   on   active   duty   in  the   U.S.  military,  earning   an
honorable  discharge.  He  has   a   high   school  degree,  which  he   earned   in   2009.  As  of
2017,  he  has  separated  from  his spouse,  whom   he  married   in   2013.  He   has  a   seven-
year-old  child.  (Items 2, 3)
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  owes  11  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $18,000
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.k). The debts include, among other things, unpaid rent, unpaid personal
loans, and unpaid utilities. While Applicant denies several of these debts in his response
to  the  SOR,  I find that the  SOR  allegations are  established  through  credit  reports and
Applicant’s admissions. (Items 1-6)
Applicant attributed his financial problems to his and his now estranged spouse’s
overspending.  He  was  unemployed  for a  period  from  about  April  2020  until  May  2020
and  from  July  2018  until  October  2018.  He  also  separated  from  his  spouse  in  2017.
