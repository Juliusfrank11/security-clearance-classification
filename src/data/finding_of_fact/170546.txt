Applicant, age 36, is unmarried with a 13-year-old child who does not reside with
him.  He  received  his  high  school  diploma  in  May  2004,  and  has  been  pursuing  a
bachelor’s degree in business administration since June 2009. This is his first application
for a security clearance. (Items 3, 4)
The record indicates that Applicant initially applied for a security clearance while
employed by Defense Contractor A, with whom he was employed as a warehouse clerk
from at least April 2018 through January 2019. On a date not identified in the record, he
became employed by another defense contractor, who is currently sponsoring his security
clearance application. (Items 3, 4)
The  SOR  alleged  14  delinquent  debts  totaling  $35,356,  including  a  $1,009
judgment for a charged-off credit-card account; three medical accounts totaling $1,245;
and  10  federal  student  loan  accounts  totaling  $33,102.  In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant
admitted each alleged debt. He did not proffer any explanation or documents in response
to the SOR allegations. (Items 1, 2)
Applicant attributed his delinquent debts generally to unemployment and the lack
of a steady income; and his medical debts more specifically to expenses associated with
an emergency-room visit at a time when he did not have health insurance in 2018. He did
not proffer any details or corroborating documents concerning his relevant income and
expense history or his ability to repay his debts. The record did not indicate whether he
provides child support or other financial support for his child. (Items 3, 4)
Following his high school graduation, Applicant was unemployed, for reasons not
indicated in the record, until May 2006. He worked full time  as a loader/unloader for a
warehouse  restoration  business  through  January  2011,  when  the  business  shut  down
due to the economic recession. He became unemployed again through May 2013 (except
for  a  month  between  November  2011  and  December  2011  when  he  found  part-time
seasonal  work  as  a  driver  helper/package  handler  for  a  shipping  company;  and  two
months between March 2013 and May 2013 when he worked part time for a temporary
employment agency). He was employed full time as a machine operator from May 2013
until he was laid off in December 2013. He was unemployed again  until he found part-
time work in July 2015 as a package handler with another shipping company. He regained
full-time  employment  in  August  2016  as  a  shipping  specialist  for  a  communications
technology  company.  He  ended  his  part-time  position  in  March  2017  due  to  its
incompatibility with his full-time work schedule. He left his full-time position in April 2018
for a better job and career advancement opportunity with Defense Contractor 1.  (Items
3, 4)
On three occasions in January 2019, Applicant was interviewed in connection with
his security clearance background investigation. He described his then financial situation
as  stable  due  to  his  gainful  employment.  He  did  not  anticipate  any  further  financial
problems unless he were to lose his job. He did not receive any financial counseling, but
proffered his own plan to better manage his finances by ensuring that he paid his bills on
time and working with his creditors to resolve his delinquent debts. (Item 4)
A  few  weeks  after  his  initial  interview  in  January  2019,  Applicant  contacted  the
creditors for his medical and student loan debts, but did not take any action to resolve his
credit-card debt. He was unsuccessful in making arrangements to pay his student loan
debts because he was not able to make an immediate payment. He anticipated that he
would be ready to make a payment the following month. He apparently set up a payment
arrangement to pay his medical debts. However, he did not proffer proof of any payment
arrangements or payments made towards either his medical or student loan debts.  He
maintained that his medical debt creditor would only release a statement once there was
a $0 balance. (Item 4)
Applicant’s March 2021 credit report revealed no new delinquent debts. However,
it showed that he financed the purchase of a $15,541 automobile in May 2020 with a $415
monthly payment, which was then in current status. His July 2018, October 2019,  and
March 2021 credit reports disclosed that two unresolved medical debts, which existed at
the  time  the  SOR  was  issued,  were  not  alleged:  a  $36  account  and  a  $674  account.
Applicant attributed them to the same emergency room visit as those alleged in the SOR.
(Item 4 at 3; Items 6, 7, 8)
In  2013,  Applicant  consumed  alcohol  at  a  friend’s  home.  On  his  drive  from  his
friend’s  home,  he  was  pulled  over  by  a  police  officer  due  to  him  swerving  his  vehicle.
Applicant admitted that he knew it was a bad decision to drive after consuming alcohol,
but  did  so  anyway because he  wanted to  celebrate  the fourth  of  July holiday.  He  was
arrested and charged with misdemeanor driving under the influence (DUI) for which he
pled guilty. The court sentenced him to 90 days in jail, which was suspended pending his
successful  completion  of  24  months  of  probation  and  payment  of  a  $1,500  fine.  The
record did not indicate whether Applicant successfully completed his probation and paid
his fine. Applicant asserted that there is zero likelihood of another DUI offense as he will
never again drive after consuming alcohol. (Item 4 at 1-2, 4)
Applicant  failed  to  timely  pay  his  federal  and  state  taxes  in  tax  year  2016.  He
claimed that he did not have money to pay them. He reported that he owed approximately
$130 for his state taxes, but did not specify an amount for his federal taxes. His tax year
2017 refunds were applied to resolve them. (Item 3 at 35; Item 4 at 4)
In 2018, Applicant replaced his expired license plate with a valid license plate he
borrowed from his cousin. He received a citation for which he paid a fine and court costs
totaling $387. (Item 4 at 2)
Applicant’s  2013  DUI,  2016  tax  debt,  and  2018  citation  were  not  alleged  in  the
SOR. Thus, I will consider them only to evaluate mitigation and the whole-person concept.
