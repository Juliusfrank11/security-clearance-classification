Applicant, age 52, is married with two minor children. His educational history was
not indicated in the record. He has been employed since October 2017 by the defense
contractor sponsoring his SCA. This is his first application for a security clearance.  He
was  initially  hired  as  a  security  officer  and  is  now  working  as  an  Emergency
Communications Center (ECC) dispatcher. (Items 3, 4; Item 5 at 34)
The SOR, as amended, alleged a mortgage foreclosure (SOR ¶ 1.e) and seven
delinquent debts totaling $57,088, including two state tax liens totaling $17,390 (SOR ¶¶
1.a, 1.b); two repossession-related consumer debts totaling $32,140 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c., 1.d);
a $809 state tax debt (SOR ¶ 1.i); and two federal tax debts totaling $6,749 (SOR ¶¶ 1.j,
1.k).  It  also  alleged  that  Applicant failed  to  timely file  his federal  and  state  income  tax
returns for tax years 2008 through 2019 (SOR ¶¶ 1.f –1.h), which he deliberately failed to
disclose on his SCA (SOR ¶ 2.a).
In  his answer  to  the  original SOR, Applicant admitted  SOR ¶¶  1.a  through  1.c and
1.f  through  1.h. He  did  not address SOR ¶¶  1.d  and  1.e, which I construed  as  denials.
Although   he   answered   “I  admit”  to   SOR  ¶   2.a,  I   construed   it  as  a   denial  because   his
accompanying  explanation  equivocated  on  the  issue  of intent. He explained: “This  item
on  my  [SCA]  was a  mistake  on  my  part.” It  is unclear whether he  meant that he  mistakenly
omitted  the  information  or that it was a  mistake  for him  to  deliberately  omit the  information.
(Item  3)
Since  Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  amended  SOR,  I  construed  his
nonresponses  to  the  new  allegations,  SOR  ¶¶  1.i  through  1.k,  as  denials.  Despite  his
earlier  admissions,  I  also  construed  his  nonresponses  to  the  five  modified  allegations,
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.f through 1.h, as denials because the changes were substantive.
---SCA
Applicant  answered  “no” to  all of  the  financial  questions on his  November  2017
SCA, including whether, in the last seven years, he: 1) failed to file or pay federal or state
taxes when required by law; 2) had a lien placed against his property for failing to pay
taxes;  3)  had  any  possessions  or  property  voluntarily  or  involuntarily  repossessed  or
foreclosed; 4) defaulted on any type of loan; or 5) had been 120 days or more delinquent
on any debt. The SCA also asked whether he was then 120 days or more delinquent on
any  debt,  to  which  he  also  answered  “no.”  Applicant  did  not  otherwise  disclose  his
delinquent returns or other derogatory financial history on the SCA. He affirmed his “no”
responses to the financial questions on the signature form of the SCA by certifying that:
My  statements on  this form  . . . are true, complete, and  correct to  the  best
of  my  knowledge  and  belief  and  are made  in  good  faith  . . . .  I understand
that   intentionally   withholding,  misrepresenting,  falsifying   .  .  .  may   have   a
negative   effect  on   my   security   clearance,  employment  prospects,   or  job
status,  up  to  and  including  denial or revocation  of my  security  clearance  .  .
. . (Item  4)
Applicant  was  interviewed  five  times  during  the  security  clearance  background
investigation  initiated  by  his  November  2017  SCA.  During  Interview  1  (November  28,
2018), he was confronted with delinquent debts that were developed from a review of his
December 2017 credit report (Item 6), including two utility debts ($174 and $325) and the
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d. While he provided information about the two
utility accounts, he denied that either of them were delinquent. He denied knowledge of
the SOR debts, but promised to investigate them and the two utility accounts, and pay
those  deemed  valid.  He  then  volunteered  information  about  the  foreclosure  alleged  in
SOR ¶ 1.e. (Item 5 at 6-9)
During Interview 1, Applicant claimed that he answered “no” to questions about his
financial record because he either misunderstood the question or did not know about a
particular debt. He also asserted that any known bills had been paid. It is unclear whether
he meant that he knew he had delinquent debts, but did not list them because they had
been paid; or whether he denied having any delinquent debts because he paid all of his
bills on time. I inferred the latter because he subsequently declared that he thought his
finances were excellent prior to being confronted with the developed debts, and that he
would not have deliberately failed to pay a debt. He planned to resolve any delinquent
debts  for  his  own  personal  responsibility  and  promised  to  stay  on  top  of  his  financial
obligations in the future. (Item 5 at 6-9)
During Interview 2 (June 19, 2019), Applicant described his financial situation as
good. He asserted that he paid cash for everything and had no credit cards or credit-card
debts to his knowledge. He reviewed an April 2019 credit report (which was not included
in  the  record),  and  was  asked  about  the  status  of  the  debts  with  which  he  had  been
confronted during Interview 1. He paid the $174 utility debt via phone during Interview 2.
He maintained that he could not provide specific details about the $325 utility debt and
the four debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d, but promised to speak with his wife and
attempt to gather documentation about them. (Item 5 at 11-12, 17c)
During Interviews 3 (June 30, 2019) and 4 (July 1, 2019), Applicant provided the
details he learned about  the $325 utility account and the  debts alleged  in SOR ¶¶ 1.a
through 1.d, and proffered plans to resolve them. He provided evidence that he paid the
$325 utility account on June 20, 2019, which was apparently deemed sufficient enough
that it was not alleged in the SOR. (Item 5 at 13-17)
Applicant  did  not  discuss  his failure  to file  2008  through  2019  federal  and  state
income tax returns until Interview 5 (July 3, 2019). During Interview 5, he was asked why
the  state  tax  liens  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  had  not  been  offset  by  his  federal
refunds. In response, he disclosed that he had not filed any federal or state returns since
approximately 2008. He then proffered plans to file his delinquent returns, with the help
of a tax accountant, and pay any outstanding tax obligations resulting therefrom. He did
not specify a date for compliance with his filing and payment obligations, but anticipated
that  his  returns  would  be  filed  as  soon  as  the  tax  accountant  received  information
requested from the IRS. (Item 5 at 18)
During Interview 5, Applicant could not give a reason for why he omitted his tax
compliance failures from his SCA, but asserted his belief that he had been compliant with
paying his taxes because they were deducted from his paychecks. In his SOR answer,
he explained: “We simply found ourselves overwhelmed and did not file.” (Item 4 at 18;
Item 3)
Tax Returns
Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2008
through 2019; his State A income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2015; and his
State B income tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2019 (SOR ¶¶ 1.f through 1.h). On
a date not indicated in the record, he hired a tax accountant to assist him with preparing
and filing his delinquent returns and resolving any outstanding tax obligations. (AE A; Item
5 at 18)
Applicant provided copies of 11 cover letters, dated August 2019, which indicated
that the tax accountant finalized his 2008 through 2018 federal and state returns. He also
provided a copy of an October 2020 cover letter, which indicated that the tax accountant
finalized his 2019 federal and state returns. The letters instructed Applicant to sign the
2008 through 2016 returns and mail them to the respective federal and state agencies at
the addresses provided. The letters indicated that the tax accountant would file the 2017
through  2019  returns  electronically  upon  receipt  of  signed  authorization  forms  from
Applicant. (AE A)
There was no evidence in the record that Applicant obtained extensions for filing
his  2008  through  2019  federal  and  state  returns.  He  did  not  provide  copies  of  his  tax
returns, signed authorization forms, tax account transcripts, or any documentary evidence
that his 2008 through 2019 federal and state returns were actually filed and received by
the respective federal and state tax agencies.  However, in  his SOR  answer, Applicant
asserted that all of his delinquent tax returns had been filed. (Item 3)
Taxes
State A filed tax liens against Applicant for $2,551 in January 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.b);
and $14,839 in December 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.a). When he contacted State A’s tax agency in
June 2019 about the liens, Applicant was informed that they were for personal income
taxes associated with a former business, Company A, that he owned from 2004 through
2009.  Applicant  claimed  that  the  tax  accountant  referenced  above  discovered  that
Company A’s business accountant made a mistake on the K-1 filed for Company A in tax
years  2008  and  2009.  Applicant  also  claimed  that  both  liens  were  removed  when  his
delinquent returns were filed, and that no liens or delinquencies were on file with State
A’s  tax  agency  as  of  2020.  However,  Applicant  did  not  provide  any  documents
corroborating his claims. (Item 3 at 2; Item 4; Item 5 at 11, 15, 16, 38; Item 6 at 5)
According to the 12 cover letters referenced above, Applicant expected to receive
refunds for each of the federal and state returns filed for tax years 2008  through 2019,
except for the following years when he expected to owe taxes: $809 to State A  for tax
year 2009 (SOR ¶ 1.i); and a combined $6,749 to the IRS for tax years 2018 and 2019
(SOR  ¶¶  1.j  and  1.k).  Neither  party  proffered  any  documents  to  establish  Applicant’s
actual federal and state income tax liability for tax years 2008 through 2019, including any
refunds received or payments made. (AE A)
In his SOR Answer, Applicant claimed that he paid all state and federal income
taxes during the years in which he had not filed a tax return; presumably based on the
same rationale he expressed during Interview 5 – i.e., not from direct payments to the tax
agencies, but from his payroll deductions. He also asserted: “when our most recent tax
accountant  got  us  caught  up  on  our  filings,  we  found  that  we  were  actually  due  over
$60,000  in  [refunds]  dating  back  to  2009.”  He  explained  that  he  only  received  “about
$8,000” because he was only entitled to refunds from the prior three years. The record
did not indicate what happened to any refunds he may have received. (Item 3)
Repossessions
Applicant financed the purchase of a recreational vehicle (RV) in April 2007 with a
$70,742 loan. A balance of $25,884 was reported on Applicant’s 2017 credit report (SOR
¶  1.c).  The  last  activity  on  the  account  was  reportedly  May  2012.  When  Applicant
contacted the creditor in June 2019, he was informed that the balance was the amount
due after the RV was sold at auction following a repossession. The creditor told him that
he could repay the full amount via a payment plan, or settle it via a one-time lump sum
$14,000 payment. Applicant acknowledged that he never made any payments following
the June 2019 conversation due to the possibility of unemployment in connection with his
security clearance adjudication. In his SOR answer, he indicated that he considered the
debt resolved because it no longer appeared on a credit report he reviewed, but did not
provide for the record. (Item 3 at 2; Item 5 at 11, 13, 14, 38; Item 6 at 6)
Applicant  financed  the  purchase  of  an  all-terrain  vehicle  (ATV)  with  a  loan,  the
details of which were not specified in the record. A balance of $6,296 was reported by a
collection company on Applicant’s 2017 credit report (SOR ¶ 1.d). He indicated that the
balance related to the repossession of the ATV. Applicant negotiated a settlement with
the original creditor for a lump-sum payment of $2,500 on July 1, 2019, which he paid on
July 5, 2019. (Item 5 at 17, 17a, 17b, 38; Item 6 at 6)
Applicant  attributed  the  RV  and  ATV  repossessions  to  being  unable  to  make
payments on the loans due to not having income in 2013. He did not otherwise  convey
any  problems  with  his finances  and  has  never  sought  financial  counseling.  He  did  not
proffer any documents concerning his relevant income and expense history or his ability
to repay his debts. His SCA revealed one period of unemployment from May 2017 through
August  2017.  During  Interview  2,  Applicant  reported  that  his  income  decreased  by
$48,000 between 2009 and 2015. During that period, he juggled three part-time jobs: 1)
self-employment with Company A, from May 2004 through July 2009; 2) self-employment
with  another company he  owned  (Company B),  from  February 2009  through  February
2016; and 3) employment  with an individual employer, from March  2011  through June
2015. (Item 4; Item 5 at 4, 5, 8, 11, 38)
For some unspecified period, Applicant co-owned Company A with two friends who
eventually bought him out. He stated that the buyout occurred over the course of one to
three  years,  and  that  he  received  approximately  $3,000  per  month  from  the  buyout.
However,  he  did  not  specify  the  total amount  of  the  buyout,  or  what  happened  to  any
funds he received. He maintained that Company B had no profit. Applicant travelled to
Mexico for tourism for six to ten days in June 2016. The record did not indicate how that
trip was funded. The record also did not indicate the reason for, or the costs associated
with, Applicant’s relocation from State A to State B in 2015. (Item 4; Item 5 at 4, 5, 6, 8,
11, 38)
Foreclosure
Applicant financed the $405,000 purchase of his primary residence in 2003 with a
mortgage loan of an unspecified amount. The loan’s monthly payment was $2,400. After
Applicant defaulted on the loan, the lender foreclosed on the loan in 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.e).
(Item 5 at 8-9)
Applicant  did  not  address  the  foreclosure  in  his  SOR  answer.  However,  he
discussed the following facts and circumstances of the foreclosure during Interview 1. In
about 2012, Applicant contacted his lender to request a loan modification. Although he
did not specify a reason for the request, he mentioned that an appraisal of his home (in
connection with a business-related loan) revealed that his mortgage loan was underwater.
An  agent  for  the  lender  told  Applicant  that  they  could  not  proceed  with  the  loan
modification until he was 90 days behind on his loan payments. After he stopped making
payments  and  was  90  days  behind,  Applicant  called  his  lender again,  but  was  told  by
another agent that he could be no more than 30 days behind. So, he made payments on
his account to bring it back to 30 days behind only to be told by another agent that he had
to be 90 days behind. Because he grew tired of dealing with his lender, he stopped making
payments and allowed the lender to foreclose on the loan. (Item 4 at 10; Item 5 at 8-9;
Item 7)
Applicant claimed that his home sold in 2013 for more than the value of the loan,
leaving him with no deficiency balance. He maintained that he was unable to obtain any
corroborating documentation. The Government proffered a document that did not resolve
the issue of whether there was a deficiency balance. The loan did not appear on his 2017
credit report. (Item 5 at 38; Items 6, 7)
