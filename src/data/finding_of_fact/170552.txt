Applicant denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.m through 1.s. She failed to provide
a response to ¶¶ 1.a through 1.l. The lack of response will be treated as denials. After a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 31 years old. She earned a bachelor’s degree in 2014 and a real estate
license  in  approximately  2016.  Applicant  attended  two  universities  and  a  community
college from 2009 through 2014, and another college in 2016, which she financed at least
partially  through  student  loans.  She  worked  part-time  jobs  from  September  2007  to
August 2017. From August 2017 to March 2020 Applicant worked full-time as a leasing
consultant.  Applicant’s  income  increased  significantly  in  April  2020,  when  she  started
working in an administrative position for a defense contractor. Applicant has never been
married and has no children. (Items 2, 3)
The SOR alleges 19 delinquent accounts totaling $53,623 including nine student
loan  accounts  ($43,974),  six  consumer  accounts  ($7,580)  and  four  medical  accounts
($2,069). (Item 1)
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  in  April  2020.  She
disclosed  delinquent  debts  estimated  at  $10,000  and  acknowledged  defaulting  on  her
student  loans.  Applicant  attributed  her  financial  issues  to  hardship  during  college  that
began  in  May  2012  and  underemployment.  She  reported  changing  employment  to
increase her income, working to settle the debts in collection, and to getting her student
loans out of default. (Item 2)
During   an  August   2020   background   interview,  Applicant  acknowledged   nine
student loan  accounts  totaling $43,974 were placed  for  collection  in the  specific amounts
alleged  at SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h,  1.i, and 1.j.  She  also  acknowledged  the
debt alleged  at SOR  ¶  1.d ($4,967) was incurred  to pay  for  cosmetic surgery  in  2013, but
did  not recall  if  she  made  a  few  payments  on  the  account,  and  did  not  recall  further details.
Applicant said  she  did  not recall  the  debts  subsequently  alleged  at SOR  ¶¶  1.k, 1.q, and
1.s,  but  agreed   the   debt  alleged   at  SOR   ¶   1.k   was  probably   hers.   She   believed   the
delinquent accounts  alleged  at SOR  ¶¶  1.l, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.r  were  for  hospitalizations and
medical   appointments   from  December   2018   to  April   2019,  stated   a   credit  collection
company   recently   contacted   her,  and   that  she   was  awaiting   written   correspondence
regarding  settlement options. Applicant reported  the  debts  alleged  at SOR  ¶¶  1.m and
1.p were  incurred  buying  clothes and  that she  did  not recall  if  she  had  made  payments
on   the   accounts.  Applicant  attributed   the   delinquent  accounts   to   underemployment,
exacerbated  by  the  requirement to pay  a  derelict  college  roommate’s expenses for  nine
months,  and   legal   expenses  to   contest  charges  she   operated   a   vehicle   under   the
influence of drugs or alcohol in 2019. Applicant reported a significant increase in income
when  she  started  work  for  a  defense  contractor  in  April  2020  and  that  she  was  more
mature. She said the pay increase would enable her to begin paying the delinquent debt
and stated her intent to pay all delinquent debts. (Item 3)
In her August 2021 answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the debts alleged at SOR
¶¶ 1.m to 1.s remained delinquent. She acknowledged several past closed accounts, and
reported  aggressive  efforts  to  improve  her  financial  condition  since  August  2020.  She
claimed  to  have  paid  all  collections,  medical  debts  and  other  accounts,  and  said  her
answer included documentary evidence reflecting a zero balance for the accounts. The
only documentary evidence attached to Applicant’s answer to the SOR is an undated two-
page document which reflects account details for a student loan account not alleged as
delinquent in the SOR. It appears this student loan was obtained in December 2017, had
a reported balance of $3,699 as of May 31, 2021, and has been reported as current since
March  2020.  The  student  loans  alleged  as  delinquent  in  the  SOR  were  obtained  from
2009 to 2013. Applicant provided no documents reflecting payment on any debt alleged
in the SOR. (Item 1)
Credit records submitted by the Government dated July 28, 2020, reflect the 19
delinquent  accounts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  to  1.s  totaling  $53,623.  Credit  records
submitted  by  the  Government  dated  October  4,  2021,  reflect  13  delinquent  accounts
alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  to  1.k,  and  1.p  totaling  $50,503  including  nine  student  loan
accounts  ($43,974),  and  three  consumer  accounts  ($6,529).  The  October  2021  credit
report reflects Applicant resolved two delinquent medical accounts totaling $300 in June
2020 and June 2021. (Items 4, 5)
