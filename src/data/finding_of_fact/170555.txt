Applicant initially admitted to SOR allegation ¶ 1.a. but later disputed and denied
it. He also denied all the remaining allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 41-years-old, and is seeking employment with a defense contractor.
(TR at page 13 line 23 to page 17 line 14.) He is unmarried, and has no children. (TR at
page 34 lines 17~21.) Applicant attributes the alleged, past-financial difficulties to brief
periods  of  unemployment.  (TR  at  page  13  line  23  to  page  17  line  14.)  In  October  0f
2021,  he  completed  a credit  counseling course.  (TR  at page  22  line  1 to page 23  line
22, and AppX F.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a. Applicant now  denies an  alleged  past-due  debt to  Creditor A  in the  amount
of  about $14,670, as  the  result of a  vehicle  accident.  His car “was totaled, .  . .  [and]  the
insurance  .  .  . had  paid  off  the  car”  loan. (TR  at  page  17  line  25  to  page  19  line  5.) This
testimony   is  supported   by   documentation   from   Creditor  A   showing   the   “Amount
Reaming” as “$0.” (AppX K at page 2.) This allegation is found  for Applicant.
1.b. and  1,c.  Applicant  denies that he  has past-due  student  loans  totaling  about
$10,986. (TR at page  19  line  6  to  page  21  line  3.) This testimony  is supported  by  credit
reports submitted  by  both  the  Government  and  Applicant,  which show  he  is current with
his student loans.  (GX  5,  and  AppX  E  at  pages 10~11.) These  allegations are  found  for
Applicant.
1.d.   Applicant   denies   an   alleged   past-due   debt   to   Creditor   D  in   the   amount  of
about $326.  (TR  at  page  23  line  23  to  page  26  line  7.) This  testimony  is supported  by
documentation  from  Creditor D showing  that this loan  “has been  paid in full.” (AppX  B.)
This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.e.  Applicant  denies   an   alleged   past-due  debt  to   Creditor  E   in  the   amount  of
about $1,477. (TR at page  26  line  8  to  page  27  line  6.) This testimony  is supported  by
documentation   from   Creditor E   showing   “no  record” in   Creditor   E’s   “system” related   to
Applicant. (AppX C.) This allegation is found  for Applicant.
1.f.   Applicant   denies   an   alleged   past-due   debt   to   Creditor   F  in   the   amount  of
about $260. (TR at  page  27  lines  10~16.) This testimony  is supported  by  documentation
from  Creditor F confirming   “final payment,” and   that the  account   “is paid   in full.”  (AppX
D.) This allegation is found  for Applicant.
Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
2.a.  Applicant  denies  any   falsification   of   his  December  2018   Electronic
Questionnaires   for  Investigations  Processing   (e-QIP)  as  it  relates  to   Section   26   and
enquires as  to  financial delinquencies in  the  last seven  years. (TR at page  29  line  22  to
page  32  line  18,  and  GX  1  at page  35.) As noted  above,  in the  findings for allegations
1.a.~1.f., Applicant was unaware of any past-due indebtedness when he executed his e-
QIP,  and,  in   fact,   he   has   no   past-due   indebtedness.   This  allegation   is  found   for
Applicant.
