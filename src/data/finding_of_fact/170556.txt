of the delinquent debts. (Item 2) His most recent credit bureau report in September 2021,

The delinquent debts also  included his mortgage  account with  about $6,255  past due.
(Item 5) He stated that some accounts are duplicates and that he is making payments on
several  accounts,  and  that  he  hired  a  debt  management  company  to  assist  him  in
resolving his delinquent debt. (Item 2)
Applicant has been employed since 2011, with no recorded breaks in employment.
He had the same job since 2016 and before that, the same job since 2011. He was not
laid  off  unexpectedly.  Applicant’s  prior  security  clearance  application  in  2013  show
financial issues. His wife at that time went to a credit counseling service in 2014, which
handled multiple financial accounts. (Items 8, 9)
As to SOR 1.a, in the amount of $4,728, for a 2019 judgment, Applicant admitted
that he believed it had been paid. He submitted a document from the debt management
company showing he settled the debt for $1,575 on June 14, 2021.
As  to  SOR  1.b,  in  the  amount  of  $34,420  for  a  collection  account,  Applicant
admitted and claimed that he pays $600 a month on the account. He did not provide any
documentation. Applicant’s 2021 credit report reflect the debt as charged off. (Item 4)
As to SOR 1.c, in the amount of $13,500 for a charged-off account Applicant stated
that  he  pays  $300  a  month  with  a  direct  withdrawal.  He  did  not  provide  any
documentation.
As to SOR 1.d, in the amount of $8,505 for a charged-off account, the account is
with the debt management company. Applicant intends to pay this bill in the future.
As  to  SOR  1.e,  in  the  amount  of  $6,527  for  a  charged-off  account,  he  denied
because it had been paid in June 2021.
As to SOR 1.f, in the amount of $3,946, for a charged-off account, he admitted and
stated that this account is with the debt management company. The account is reflected
on his 2021 credit bureau report as charged off. (Item 4)
As  to  SOR  1.g,  in  the  amount  of  $2,339,  for  a  charged–off  account,  Applicant
denied because it is a duplicate of the account in SOR 1.h to the same creditor. He is
paying on this account monthly. This account 1.h does appear to be a duplicate.

admitted and stated that this account is with the debt management group.

balance. (Item 4)
As to SOR 1.k, in the amount of $38,795, Applicant denied this account and stated

with  a  total  balance  of  $194,327,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  is  working  with  the  bank

Applicant submitted documents from the debt management company that showed
he  has  paid money to them  since  at  least  2016. The  documents do  not  identify which
accounts received the money. but do not identify which accounts the money was applied.
In Applicant’s 2020 security clearance application, (SCA) he reported that he paid
his spouse’s and his bills in full in March “2023” through the debt management company.
(Item  3),  and  that  he  had  no  financial  problems.  It  is  not  clear  from  the  record  which
accounts he refers to with this statement. (Item 3) The accounts that he mentioned in his
SCA that he is paying, do not match the alleged account on the SOR. However, his 2020
credit  bureau  report  (Items  5,  6)  reflected  other  non-alleged  SOR  accounts  “pays  as
agreed.”  Applicant’s 2013 credit bureau report (Item 9) shows all accounts as “pays as
agreed.”
Applicants  2020  subject  interview  revealed  that  his financial  problems  began  in
2016, after his spouse lost income, reducing the overall family income by approximately
$40,000.  He  used  credit  cards  to  supplement  the  income.  He  stated  that  he  was
supporting two households. He stated that he would pick and choose which bills to pay.
Applicant stated that he was naïve regarding finances and allowed balances to increase
beyond  his  ability  to  repay.  He  attempted  to  negotiate,  but  most  creditors  refused  to
negotiate.  (Item  10) He  sought  loans  to  consolidate  debts,  sought credit  counseling in
2016  in  lieu  of  bankruptcy  and  entered  into  an  agreement  with  the  current  debt
management company. (Item 10) He told the investigator that he pays the debt company
$700 monthly, with a $500 service fee, which is dispersed to creditors.
Applicant listed  the  above  delinquent debts with  his debt consolidation  company.
However, it is not clear from  the  record which accounts have  been  settled  or paid.  (Item
10) Applicant told  the  investigator that his financial issues  are  slowly  improving, but  he
continues  to  struggle financially. He has  a  budget,  and  he  intends to  have  all  delinquent
accounts paid by 2023.
Applicant’s  net  monthly  salary  is  $4,480;  his  military  retirement  is  $600;  VA
disability $3,492; and his co-habitant’s net monthly income is $1,000 for a total of $9,572.
(Item  10)  He  listed  the  accounts  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  are  currently  with  the  debt
management  company.  He  listed  his  monthly  discretionary  funds  after  expenses  and
debts as $1,324. (Item 10)
Applicant  reported  real  estate  totaling  $236,000  and  $187,000;  liquid  assets  of
$1,924; a car valued at $15,000; a recreational vehicle for $8,000; with a total a value of
non-liquid assets in the amount of $446,000. He promised the investigator that he would
provide personal bank statements for the investigation, but he did not. (Item 10)
Personal Conduct
As to SOR 2.a, it was alleged that in March 18, 2018, Applicant was arrested and
charged  with  Domestic  Violence  and  Criminal Damage  to Property.  The  charges  were
dismissed. Applicant admitted this allegation.
As  to  SOR  2.b,  it  was  alleged  that  Applicant  was  investigated  in  April  2020  for
Criminal  Damage  to  Property  and  was  referred  for  prosecution.  Applicant  denied  this
allegation  as  he  filed  charges  against  the  victim.  In  addition,  he  wrote  a  statement
regarding the person responsible.
Applicant disclosed in his 2020 security clearance application that he was accused
of domestic violence in 2018 due to an altercation with his cohabitant. He related she was
drinking and in the situation, he had broken a picture of his own. He pleaded innocent,
went to trial and case was dismissed because he was getting his girlfriend help with her
drinking disorder and also counseling. (Item 3)
Applicant  was  investigated  for  property  damage,  but  he  volunteered  during  his
2020  subject  interview  that  his  girlfriend  had  consumed  a  “large  amount  of  alcohol.”
Applicant  left  the  residence  to  de-escalate  the  situation  and  when  he  returned  he
discovered damage in the residence. Applicant made a walk-in report to the police and
his cohabitant was charged with criminal damage to property. (Item 10)
The record file contained no police report or other criminal documents to support
the above allegations against the Applicant. The Government  conceded in its argument
in the FORM that the record evidence does not support the allegation under SOR 2.b for
personal conduct.
