The  SOR alleges that,  as of  June  29, 2021, Applicant owed  charged-off  debts of
$14,237  (SOR ¶  1.a), $12,495  (SOR ¶  1.b), $4,415  (SOR ¶  1.d), $4,301  (SOR ¶  1.e), and
$10,534   (SOR  ¶   1.f);  and   a   collection   debt  of   $8,423   (SOR  ¶   1.c).  When   Applicant
answered  the  SOR, he  admitted  five  of  the  six  alleged  debts.  He denied  the  debt in SOR ¶
1.f  on  the  basis that it has been  paid.  He provided  a  document from  a  collection  entity
showing  that the  debt had  been  settled  on  April 8, 2020, on  receipt  of  a  final resolution
payment of  $4,740. He explained  that he  was working  through  a  debt-resolution  company
to  address his delinquent accounts.  (Item  1.)  After considering  Items 1  through  7, I make
the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 66 years old and unmarried. He has no children. He has worked in the
field of physical security since at least January 1991. He began working for his current
employer,  a  defense  contractor,  in  March  2019.  As  of  July 2020,  he  was  a  guard  site
supervisor  for  the  U.S.  Army.  (Item  7.)  Applicant  indicated  on  a  March  21,  2020
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that he had been granted a security
clearance at the secret level, although he did not know the date. (Item 2.) In response to
the SOR, Applicant stated that he has been a security clearance holder since the early
1980s. (Item 1.)
On his March 2020 SF 86, Applicant listed charged-off credit-card debts of $14,237
(SOR  ¶  1.a),  $16,796  (two  accounts  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.e),  $8,423  (SOR  ¶  1.c),  and
$10,534 (SOR ¶ 1.f). With respect to each of the debts, Applicant stated, “I was ripe [sic]
off for about 49000 dollars and I was not able to [pay my] credit card bills.” He indicated
that he hired a company “to take care of the problem,” but he had not yet heard from his
creditors. (Item 2.)
One or more of the credit reports in evidence from September 5, 2019 (Item 3), April
24, 2020 (Item 4), March 9, 2021 (Item 5), and November 9, 2021 (Item 6) showed that
Applicant defaulted on the following accounts.
SOR ¶ 1.a — $14,237
On May 11, 2016, Applicant opened a credit-card account with a $19,500 credit
limit. He made a last payment on the account in May 2017. In February 2018, a $14,237
past-due balance was charged off. (Items 3-7.)
SOR ¶ 1.b — $12,495
On April 2, 1998, Applicant opened a credit-card account with a $12,500 credit limit.
During his July 2020 PSI, Applicant explained that he had obtained  the credit card for
“business and  consolidation  reasons.” He made a last payment on the account in May
2017. The account was seriously delinquent as of January 2018. By September 2019, the
account had been charged off for $12,495. (Items 3-7.)
SOR ¶ 1.c — $8,423
On August 18, 2009, Applicant opened a credit-card account with a $7,500 credit
limit. Applicant made a last payment on the account in November 2017. The account was
seriously delinquent as of July 2018. A $7,292 balance was charged off. As of September
2019, the account was $8,423 past due. (Items 3-7.)
SOR ¶ 1.d — $4,415
Applicant obtained an unsecured personal loan on August 13, 2012, to pay some
bills. He made no payments after May 2017, and a $4,415 balance was charged off  in
October 2017.  (Items 3-7.)
SOR ¶ 1.e — $4,301
On March 19, 1998, Applicant opened a credit-card account with a $3,850 credit
limit. He made no payments after May 2017. A $4,301 balance was charged off in July
2018. (Items 3-6.) As of April 2020, the debt was listed on his credit report as a charge-off
and as a collection balance. (Item 4.)
SOR ¶ 1.f — $10,534
On May 11, 2016, Applicant opened a credit-card account with a $10,670 credit
limit. The account was charged off for $10,534 on December 19, 2017. (Items 2, 3.) On
April 8, 2020, Applicant paid $4,740, which was accepted in full settlement of the debt.
(Item 1.)
When  interviewed  by  an  authorized  investigator  for  the  OPM  on  July  8,  2020,
Applicant  stated  that  he  was  contacted  by  an  unknown  person  in  2016  and  offered  a
business opportunity. In return for an initial investment of cash in an amount he could not
recall, Applicant would receive a percentage from the company’s sales. One month after
his initial investment, Applicant received $500, which was enough to persuade him that the
business opportunity was legitimate. Applicant invested a total of $16,000 on credit, even
though he did not receive another payment for his investments. He then stated that he
received an unsolicited offer from another company, claiming that it could “set up a false
company for him” through which the business expenses could be written off to clear the
debts.  Applicant  paid  $14,000  into  that  venture.  He  denied  any  susceptibility  to  future
scams as he had become weary of business ventures and knows that offers that sound too
good  to  be  true  probably  are  scams.  Applicant  stated  that  he  had  no  paperwork  or
electronic correspondence about the dealings. He did not report the scams to the police.
(Item 7.)
Applicant admitted that he owed the past-due debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.e. He
stopped  paying  on  the  accounts  because  the  minimum  monthly  required  payments
became too high for him to pay them and also meet his living expenses. He paid a debt-
resolution  company $360  a  month  for about  a  year from 2018 to 2019  to address  the
debts, but then began to suspect that he was being scammed.  After learning from his
creditors that no efforts had been made to negotiate with them, he stopped paying the
debt-resolution firm. Aware of the charge offs, he had not contacted his creditors in over
three  years.  He  expressed  that  he  did  not  plan  to  pay  the  defaulted  balances,  but  if
contacted, he would attempt to settle the debts for less than their full balances. (Item 7.)
Applicant told the OPM investigator that his base annual income is $35,000, but with
overtime he can earn up to $60,000 a year. He estimated his monthly take-home income at
$2,288 from which he pays his monthly expenses totaling $1,850. He did not maintain a
savings account but had about $17,482 in his checking account. (Item 7.)
As of March 9, 2021, Applicant’s credit report showed that no progress had been
made  toward  resolving  the  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.e.  Applicant  was  making  timely
payments of $300 a month on his $32,822 mortgage for his mobile home; $215 a month on
a car loan obtained in October 2019 for $10,327; and $50 a month on an installment loan
obtained in September 2019 for $2,846. Applicant had no open credit-card accounts. (Item
5.)
As of November 9, 2021, Equifax was showing no progress toward addressing the
past-due balances in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.e totaling $43,871. Applicant had continued to make
timely payments on his mortgage, which had a balance of $19,294. In September 2021, he
paid off his car loan with his payment of $4,135. In June 2021, he paid off an unsecured
loan obtained in September 2019. He had no open credit-card accounts. (Item 6.)
In  response  to  the  June  29, 2021  SOR, Applicant admitted  that he  had  financial
difficulties  largely  because  he  “was  taken  advantage  of  by  a  debt  relief  agency.”  He
explained   that  he   was  contacted   by   the   debt-resolution   company,  which   promised   to
handle everything  with  his creditors in return for monthly  payments of  $360. After he  had
made  several months of  payments,  he  learned  that his creditors had  not  been  contacted.
He asserts that shortly  after he  stopped  paying  the  first debt-resolution  firm, he  contacted
another debt-relief  company, who  instructed  him  to  cancel his credit cards  and  stop  paying
them. Applicant authorized  the  debt-relief  company  to  handle his defaulted  accounts.  He
provided  proof  that the  debt in SOR ¶  1.f  had  been  settled, and  stated  that he  was still
working  with  the  debt-relief  firm  to  settle his remaining  delinquent  debts.  As  evidence  of his
financial  responsibility,  Applicant  cited   the   recent  pay   off   of   his  vehicle   loan   “well   in
advance  of  the  loan  terms.” Additionally, he  was making  his monthly  mortgage  and  utility
payments on time and in full. (Item 1.)
Applicant presented no details about his monthly payments to the second debt-relief
firm and no evidence showing progress toward resolving the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.e, even
though he had an opportunity to update the evidentiary record in response to the FORM.
