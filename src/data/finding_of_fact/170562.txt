Applicant  is  49  years  old  and  was  married  to  his  first  wife  from  2005  until  they
divorced in 2015. He remarried in 2018. He has an eleven-year-old daughter from his first
marriage and three teenage stepchildren who are ages 14, 17, and 18. Applicant studied
electrical  engineering  during  college,  achieving  over  120  credit  hours,  but  did  not
graduate  with  a  degree.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  (Company  A)  since
March 2003, and he currently works as an engineering manager. Applicant was granted
a secret security clearance in approximately 2010. (GE 1-2; Tr. 10-11, 23-26, 33-35)
Applicant admitted using marijuana from February 2015 to April 2020, as alleged
in  the  SOR,  but  denied  using  marijuana  after  having  ever  been  granted  access  to
classified information. He denied ever having access to classified materials, stating in his
answer to the SOR, “For as long as I have held a clearance I have never asked our [facility
security officer] FSO to establish a need to know and as such have never been granted
access to classified materials.” (Answer; AE A; Tr. 47)
Applicant  testified  that he  first  used marijuana  in 1993,  during his junior year of
college. He used it every other week or monthly until he started working for Company B
in 1996 or 1997, when he stopped using marijuana because it no longer benefited his life.
He next used marijuana once in approximately 2006, shortly after he married his first wife.
While she regularly used marijuana, he did not, as he could be subjected to drug testing
by his employer, for whom he continues to work. Applicant stated that he disclosed this
one-time use in his 2010 SCA. The Government did not offer this document as evidence.
(Tr. 25-28, 35-37, 39)
On November 30, 2020, Applicant submitted his SCA and disclosed that he used
marijuana four to six times between February 2015 and April 2020. He claimed he used
marijuana  due  to  his  divorce  and  not  having  his  daughter  during  the  holidays.  When
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in December 2020, he confirmed
that he used marijuana four to six times in the previous seven years, and that most of the
use occurred by smoking it through a pipe, although he did consume an edible on one
occasion. He used marijuana recreationally, at home, while he was relaxing, and his wife
obtained  it  from  a  friend.  He  did  not  clarify  which  wife  had  obtained  the  marijuana.
(Answer; GE 1 at 62-63; GE 2; Tr. 28-30)
At the hearing, Applicant testified that he used marijuana approximately two times
in  2015,  once  with  his  first  wife  and  once  with  a  friend.  He  testified  that  his  next  use
occurred  over  the  holidays  in  2019  with  his  second  wife,  and  he  attributed  his  use  to
anxiety and the stress of dealing with a blended family. Applicant also consumed an edible
form of marijuana provided to him by his current wife in April 2020. He attributed his most
recent usage to stress and anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Applicant did not
purchase  the  marijuana  that  he  used, his wives and  a  friend  provided  it for him.  (Tr. 28-
30, 39-40)
As a result of Applicant’s 2015 divorce, his subsequent marriage, and the stress
of blending children from two families, he started to attend counseling in 2014 to address
his anxiety. He has continued to attend counseling sporadically for the past seven years
and  sought  other  avenues  such  as  exercise,  meditation,  and  social  interactions  to
address his stress and anxiety, but he continued to use marijuana occasionally until April
2020. (AE F-G; Tr. 20, 24, 32-33, 51)
Applicant’s employer has never drug tested him, but his employer could test him
at any time. He stated that company policy is that employees are not to be impaired while
they are at work, but he is unsure if there is a policy against illegal drug use and marijuana
use. In Applicant’s state of residence, medicinal and recreational marijuana use is illegal.
He did not report his 2015 to 2020 marijuana use to his supervisor or FSO, but he knew
his use was inconsistent with holding a DOD security clearance. At the hearing, during
his  interview,  and  in  his  2020  SCA,  Applicant  stated  that  he  does  not  intend  to  use
marijuana in the future. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 31-32, 37-42)
Applicant’s  provided  documentary  and  testimonial  evidence  of  the  important
projects he supports in his role at his company. He also provided evidence of his stable
financial record and excellent performance record. (AE C-D; H-O; Tr. 18-22, 43-46)
