Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c and denied 1.d. After
a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 49 years old. He married in 2009 and has two children, ages 12 and
10 years old. He served in the military from 1993 to 1997 and was honorably discharged.
He has worked for the same employer since 2008.
Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to a period in 2018, when the tenants
living  in  a  property  he  rented  failed  to  pay  the  rent,  and  he  was  unable  to  pay  the
mortgage.  The  property  was  foreclosed.  In  his  background  investigation  with  a
government investigator, he indicated once the property was foreclosed and sold, he had
no  future  issues  with  it.  He  also  stated  that his financial  problems were  due  to  paying
daycare expenses, and he had too much debt. (GE 4)
In  his SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  he  owes  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a
($27,302).  The  debt,  which  is  listed  on  his  credit  report  as  a  line-of-credit  has  been
charged off. Applicant did not provide any information of his efforts to resolve the debt. It
is  unclear  if  Applicant  believes  this  debt  was  included  with  his  mortgage  foreclosure,
which occurred in 2018. He did not provide evidence as to the debt’s current status. It is
unresolved. (Item 2, 4)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶  1.b ($10,867) is credit card debt.  During  Applicant’s
June  2020  background  interview,  he  told  the  government  investigator  that  he  had  too
much  debt  and  was  unable  to  make  payments  on  this  account.  He  began  receiving
collection notices and phone calls regarding the debt in about 2017. He made no attempt
to pay the debt and forgot about it, but now had enough earnings  to begin paying it in
August  2020.  He  would  arrange  an  automatic  payment  plan.  He  did  not  provide  any
evidence that he has made arrangements to pay this debt. It is unresolved. (Item 4, 5, 6)
The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  ($8,328)  is  a  credit  card  debt.  Applicant
acknowledge to the government investigator that he owed the debt and was unable to
pay it. He began receiving collection notices by mail and phone in 2016. He forgot about
the debt. He told the investigator that he now is earning enough to pay the debt and would
begin paying $150 a month beginning in August 2020. He did not provide any evidence
that he has made arrangements to pay this debt. It is unresolved. (Items 4, 5, 6)
Applicant  provided  documentation that the debt  in  SOR  ¶ 1.d  ($57) is  resolved.
(Item 2). Credit reports from May 2020 and March 2021 corroborate the delinquent debts
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b and 1.c. (Items 5, 6)
Applicant did not provide any evidence he has participated in financial counseling.
He did not provide information as to his current income, expenses, budget or financial
stability.
