Applicant is 44, and has never been married. He has a 23-year-old son and a 21-
year-old  daughter.  He  received  a  Bachelor  of  Science  degree  in  computer  science  in
2009.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  since  October  2018  as  an  information
technology  analyst.  One  week  before  the  hearing,  he  started  working  part-time  at  an
outlet retail store. This is his first application for a position of trust. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr.13-17,
64)
Financial Considerations
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  15  delinquent  debts,  totaling  $26,582.07.
Additionally, Applicant is indebted to the IRS and his state for an unalleged amount for
tax years 2014 and 2015. In his response to the SOR, he admitted all of the guideline F
allegations  and  claimed  he  was  either  paying  each  debt  or  working  with  a  debt
consolidator. The debts alleged in the SOR were confirmed by Applicant’s credit bureau
reports (CBR) and his response to DOHA interrogatories. (SOR; Answer; See Chart)

Applicant attributes his financial delinquencies to a number of factors: a period of
unemployment between June 2016 and October 2016; a period in which he lacked health
insurance;  a  period  when  he  did  have  insurance,  but  he  had  a  high  deductible;  a
relationship that ended in 2018, and left him with some of the residual joint utility bills; and
the COVID-19 pandemic. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. 20, 28, 37-40, 63-64)
In  June  13, 2018,  Applicant’s work  hours were reduced  because  of  a  lack of work,
and  his position  was eventually  terminated.  He received  unemployment  benefits, but  his
child  support payments were automatically  deducted  from  his checks, which left him  with
very  little to  pay  his bills. In  January  2019,  a  judgment was entered  against  Applicant  for
the  almost $20,000  student loan  debt alleged  in SOR ¶  1.a.  Since  May  2019,  his wages
have  been  garnished  $400  monthly. He provided  documentation  to  reflect that as of June
2021, the  balance  of the  account alleged  in SOR ¶  1.a  was $9,611.43. (See  Chart;  Tr.
28-35)
In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  indicated  he  was  working  with  a  debt
consolidator to resolve many of the debts alleged in the SOR. However, he admitted at
the hearing that he never made payments to the debt consolidation company, nor has he
made payments toward the underlying debts. (See Chart; Tr. 36, 57)
Applicant did not disclose any tax issues in his 2016 SCA. During his October 2018
interview with a Government investigator (adopted in July 2019), Applicant disclosed that
he was audited in 2017 for either his 2014 or 2015 state and federal income tax returns,
and both the state and the IRS were garnishing his paychecks $75. In his Answer to the
SOR, he claimed he was making payments to both his state’s department of revenue and
the IRS. He averred he established payment agreements with the IRS in October 2019
and with  his  state in November 2019.  He did  not provide  supporting documentation  to
corroborate his claims. (Answer; GE 1 at 31; GE 2 at 12)
At the hearing, Applicant testified that his tax year (TY) 2014 and 2015 state and
federal income tax issues arose as result of him purposely not including unemployment
benefits he had received when he filed his returns. He did this because he needed the
money he anticipated he would receive from his returns to pay his bills. He knew that he
owed money to the IRS and his state, but he manipulated the information in his tax filings
to reduce his income and to maximize his refunds. Applicant claimed that he timely filed
both his TY 2014 and 2015 state and federal income tax returns. He also claimed that he
established a payment agreement with the IRS in January 21, 2020,  that he has been
paying $150 per paycheck and that he owed no back taxes to the IRS for TY 2014 and
2015. He provided no documentation to support his claims. (Tr. 36, 48-52)
In  his  post-hearing  submissions,  Applicant  provided  copies  of  pay  stubs  from
Company  B.  These  stubs  reflect  garnishments,  in  various  and  inconsistent  amounts,
between July 2019 and June 2021. The garnishments did not occur every month, and the
stubs do not reflect the creditors that were garnishing his wages. One of the documents
provided by Applicant clearly shows that some of the garnishments reflected in the pay
stubs were for the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i, and the outstanding balance on July 13,
2021 was $543.67. (See Chart; AE C; AE I-K; Tr. 36-44)
Applicant testified that his paychecks were garnished to pay his outstanding state
taxes and the $240 debt alleged SOR ¶ 1.l. This debt was related to some of the  fines
and related criminal activity alleged in the SOR. According to Applicant, he believes the
documentation  that  he  provided  after  the  hearing  demonstrates  that  he  has  no
outstanding financial obligations to his state; and that this debt should be resolved in his
favor. I disagree. It is unclear from the documentation that the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.l
has  been  paid  and  resolved.  This  documentation  does  demonstrate  that  in  the  past,
Applicant was behind on his child support payments, and his state tax refund from 2016
was seized and applied to this obligation. Applicant’s 2014 state income taxes were filed
and resolved in a timely manner, and his refund was applied to a debt owed to another
undisclosed state agency. His 2015 state income tax return was filed and paid in full as
of June 4, 2019. It was not filed and paid in a timely manner, but it is resolved. (AE C, AE
E-H; Tr. 44-48)
In his post-hearing submissions, Applicant claimed he submitted documentation
regarding his federal income taxes. However, the documentation that he provided is for
his state  income  taxes. Additionally, he  labeled  documents  as  “IRS  Documents 1” and
“IRS Documents 2,” which I marked as AE E and AE F, respectively. These documents
are duplicates of each other. (AE C; AE E-H)
Applicant has been using Quicken software to monitor his finances. He testified
that he is current on all of his bills, and his federal student loans are deferred due to the
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Applicant filed for Chapter
7  bankruptcy  protection  in  2010,  and  his  debts  totaling  $70,000  to  $80,000  were
discharged in 2012. His financial issues were the result of medical debt, credit cards, and
payday loans –  living outside of his financial means. His bankruptcy and several other
incidents in the personal conduct section, infra, are not alleged in the SOR, and they will
not be considered as disqualifying conduct. However, conduct not alleged in the SOR in
this decision will be considered in the application of mitigating conditions, for assessment
of Applicant’s credibility, and in the whole-person analysis. (GE 1 at 30; GE 2 at 12-13;
Tr. 20, 58-59)

Before  he  graduated  from  high  school,  Applicant  enlisted  in  the  U.S.  Navy’s
delayed entry program in May 1996. While he was in the Navy, he struggled with following
rules and had issues with authority.  Additionally, his father’s  stroke from a year earlier
weighed  heavily  on  him.  Due  to  these  issues,  Applicant  did  not  handle  the  stress  and
demands of the military and chose to leave the Navy without authorization in August 1996.
He was apprehended in September 1997, charged with unauthorized absence (UA), and
administratively discharged from the Navy with an Other than Honorable (OTH) discharge
in October 1997, as alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a. There is no evidence he was tried by court-
martial for being absent without leave. (See Chart; Tr. at 66-70)
In 1998 or 1999, Applicant was arrested for fraudulently using and charging $1,000
to $1,200 to his son’s mother’s credit card. This incident was not alleged in the SOR and
will not be considered as disqualifying conduct. However, he testified that he never paid
the associated fine for this incident, and there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest,
which resulted in the arrest alleged in SOR ¶ 2.g, for failure to pay. (Tr. 94-95)
Between  February  2003  and  December  2004,  Applicant  was  arrested  multiple
times for incidents related to domestic abuse, as alleged in SOR ¶¶ 2.d and 2.e. These
incidents involved the mother of his daughter. According to Applicant they have a good
relationship at this time. The December 2004 domestic abuse incident was not alleged in
the SOR and will not be considered as disqualifying conduct. (Tr. at 72, 85-90)
Applicant was arrested three times for filling his car up with gasoline at gas stations
and  driving  away  without  paying.  These  arrests  occurred  in  two  states  between
approximately 2005 and 2006. He admitted at the hearing that he engaged in this criminal
behavior  a  total  of  seven  or  eight  times,  but  was  only  caught  the  three  times  he  was
arrested. Only one of these incidents was alleged in SOR ¶ 2.i, the remaining two arrests
and the other incidents will not be considered as disqualifying conduct. (Tr. at 96-97)
Between 2007 and 2013, Applicant sporadically saw counselors as a result of his
then  partner demanding  that  he  seek  help and  modify  his behavior  if  he  was  going  to
remain in their relationship. As a result, he had fewer issues with law enforcement during
this period. They broke up in the summer of 2013 or 2014. (Tr. 75-77)
In  2014,  Applicant  started  dating  Jane  Doe.  She  was  abused  as  a  child  and  in
previous  relationships. They fought during their relationship, but the  police were  never
involved until he moved out of their shared residence. In July 2016, when he returned to
remove his belongings from their home, they argued, and they both called the police. As
a result of this incident, a four-year restraining order was issued against Applicant. At the
hearing,  he  claimed  he  unknowingly  violated  the  restraining order by  returning to  their
apartment complex to check on a vehicle that he left there. (Tr. 77-84)
Following the 2016 arrest alleged in SOR ¶ 2.j for violation of a restraining order,
Applicant was court-ordered to attend over 50 weekly counseling sessions. He was tested
and  subsequently  diagnosed  with  Asperger’s  syndrome.  Applicant’s  counseling  has
helped him understand his anger issues. Since he completed the mandatory program in
approximately September 2018, Applicant has attended 20 voluntary sessions. As of the
date  of  the  hearing,  he  most  recently  attended  counseling  in  May  2021.  He  currently
meditates daily to help himself mentally and talks to a good friend. The restraining order
expired in November 2020. (Tr. 71-76, 83-85, 104-106)
The SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested or ticketed ten times for operating a
vehicle  while  his license  was  revoked  or suspended between August  2000 and  March
2017.  The  documentary  evidence
indicates  Applicant  was  actually  arrested
approximately  seventeen  times  between  August  2000  and  June  2019.  At  the  hearing,
Applicant  admitted  that  the  last  time  he  was  arrested  or  ticked  for  driving  under  a
suspended or revoked license or with no insurance was in 2020. Additionally, there were
periods in 2020 that he operated a vehicle without a valid driver’s license and without car
insurance. He lost his driver’s license due to receiving too many speeding tickets.  (See
Chart; Tr. 98-100)
Applicant testified that his numerous tickets for operating without a  valid  driver’s
license were the result of him being the sole wage earner in his family, and his need to
get to work. At his hearing, Applicant claimed that he had had paid all of the state fees
associated with his various tickets and crimes, his driver’s license was in good standing,
and his vehicle was fully insured. (Tr. 19-20, 98)
In his 2016 SCA, Applicant did not disclose any marijuana use during the previous
seven years. In his October 2018 interview with the Government investigator, he admitted
to  using  marijuana  in  2012  or  2014.  At  the  hearing,  he  testified  that  his  “firm  belief  is
marijuana is not necessarily a drug and should be taken off the Schedule I with the DEA
so [he does not] think of that as a drug per se.” When questioned, he admitted to using it
in 2017 or 2018, after he completed his SCA, but before his interview with the investigator.
Applicant’s failure to disclose his drug use in his SCA and during his interview were not
alleged in the SOR. Additionally, his drug use was not alleged in the SOR. His failure to
disclose his marijuana use on his SCA and during his interview will not be considered as
disqualifying conduct. (GE 1 at 28-29; GE 2 at 10-11; Tr. at 80; 102-104)
The documentary evidence indicates Applicant had outstanding warrants almost
continuously between 1999 and 2009. These warrants were often related to his criminal
conduct alleged in the SOR. However, his failure to resolve his court issues related to his
traffic  tickets  for  operating  a  vehicle  without  a  valid  or  suspended  license  also  led  to
multiple warrants. Additionally, he failed to pay his fines, and his checks were returned
for  non-sufficient  funds,  resulting  in  multiple  judgments  against  him  related  to  his
offenses. (GE 6; GE 9)
Applicant loves his current job and wants to continue working there. He has had
no reprimands other than attendance issues when he first starting working there due to
court-related  obligations.  He  believes  he  is  highly  regarded  at  his  position  by  his
supervisor. (Tr.at 118-119)
