Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $46,578 for four
delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e), one of which (SOR 1.a) was a
federal income tax debt for $6,584. It was further alleged that Applicant filed a Chapter
13 bankruptcy petition in April 2017 that was dismissed in April 2018 for failure to make
payments  as  required  by  the  petition’s  wage  earners  plan  (SOR  2.b).  In  response,
Applicant admitted all of  the SOR allegations and provided information about his 2017
Chapter  13  petition.  (Answer)  In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by  Applicant’s
admissions, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 45  years old and has worked as a civilian military instructor for two
different defense contractors since March 2010. He was hired by his current employer in
April 2013. Applicant served on active duty in the military between April 1996 and August
2006, and he has held a security clearance since 2004. (GX 1; Tr. 32 – 35)
Applicant was married between 2005 and 2017, when he and his ex-wife divorced
after  separating  in  2014.  They  have  two  children,  ages  14  and  11  together.  Terms  of
Applicant’s divorce required him to pay child support of $1,200 each month, alimony of
$800  each  month,  and  to  provide  ongoing  medical  insurance  for  his  ex-wife  and  his
children.  Applicant  also  was  required  to  pay  most  of  the  couple’s  debts,  including
mortgage and car loans. (GX 1; GX 2; AX K; Tr. 37 – 38)
The   SOR  allegations  of   debt  and   bankruptcy   are  supported   by   GX   1   –   5,  by
Applicant’s  discussion   of   those   issues  in   a   personal  subject   interview   conducted   on
February  10,  February  13, and  March  6, 2017, and  by  Applicant’s admissions to   those
allegations. The  tax  debt alleged  at  SOR  1.a  arose  when  Applicant  claimed  his wife  and
children  as dependents on  his 2014  federal income  tax  return. Unbeknownst to  him, his
wife  filed  her own  2014  return  and  claimed  their  children  as  exemptions. This  precluded
Applicant from  getting  those  deductions, resulting  in an  unexpected  federal income  tax
bill for $11,693,  which he  was unable to  pay  outright.  He  contacted  the  IRS  in 2015  to
establish  a  repayment plan; however, available information  shows that he  did not make
any  direct payments on  his 2014  tax  bill until September 2021.  At that  time,  Applicant paid
$8,162.55  to  the  IRS  to  resolve  that debt.  The  rest  of  the  original obligation   likely   was
satisfied  through  involuntary  diversions of federal income  tax  refunds for tax  years 2014
through  2020. (Answer; GX 1  –  5; AX A;  Tr. 35  –  36, 73  –  74)
In addition to his unexpected tax debt, most of Applicant’s other financial difficulties
stemmed  from  the  expenses  associated  with  his  divorce.  In  addition  to  his  support
obligations and the assumption of marital debts, Applicant had to pay rent and other bills
associated with living apart from the marital residence. He estimates he had initially about
$600 remaining each month after expenses. In August 2018, his older child suffered a
head injury. His medical insurance covered most of the treatment costs, but Applicant still
had to pay a $4,200 deductible. Eventually, he fell behind in car loan payments for two
vehicles. One was repossessed in 2016 and resold at auction. The remainder after resale
of that vehicle was $12,211 and is alleged at SOR 1.d. The other vehicle was repossessed
and auctioned off in early 2017. The remainder after resale for that loan $6,420 and is
alleged at SOR 1.e. Neither debt has been resolved; however, as will be discussed below,
Applicant has sufficient funds available to him to pay both debts. (GX 1 – 4; AX D; AX E;
Tr. 37 – 38, 56 – 59, 96 – 97)
Applicant  also  owed  $21,363  for  a  delinquent  debt  for  a  credit  card  account  as
alleged at SOR 1.c. He testified that he incurred the debt by using the card excessively
to make ends meet after he and his ex-wife separated. The account became delinquent
in January 2016. In October 2021, he reached a settlement with that creditor and paid
about $15,000 to resolve the debt. (AX C; Tr. 38, 56 – 59)
As  alleged at SOR 1.b,  Applicant filed a  Chapter 13 bankruptcy  petition in April
2017. By the terms of a wage earners repayment plan, he was required to pay $724 each
month for 60 months to resolve the debts listed in the petition. In January 2018, he was
ordered to pay $1,449 to resolve an arrearage of missed payments, and to resume his
$724 monthly payments; however, by June 2018 had again failed to comply with the terms
of the repayment plan and the petition was dismissed. Applicant testified that he did not
make the payments, in part, because of his own poor financial management practices.
As he testified, he “lost control of [his] finances and it kind of went south.” (GX 5; Tr. 36 –
38)
Around  the  time  the  SOR  was  issued  in  October  2019,  Applicant  filed  another
Chapter 13 petition. According to the repayment plan for that petition, he was required to
pay  $985  each  month  for  60  months  starting  in  November  2019.  Applicant  made
payments  for  several  months;  however,  at  some  point  the  monthly  requirement  was
increased to $1,707 after it was determined that not all of his liabilities had been included
in  the  petition.  Applicant  was  unable  to  afford  that  amount  each  month  and  soon  fell
behind.  In  May  2021,  he  was  ordered  to  resume  his  $1,707  payments  and  to  pay  an
additional $1,138 for six months to bring his account current. He could not make those
payments and the petition was dismissed in August 2021. Over the course of 13 months
while the petition was viable, Applicant made payments totaling $22,385. (Answer; GX 6;
AX B; Tr. 68 – 73)
After his first Chapter 13 petition was dismissed, Applicant tried without success
to  contact  the  creditors  listed  in  the  SOR  to  resolve  his  debts.  Before  his  bankruptcy
petition, he had engaged a financial counseling company to assist in resolving his debts;
however, the company he used turned out to be ineffective and unreliable.  Since then,
the  only  financial  counseling  he  has  received  was  through  the  financial  counseling
courses that are a prerequisite for filing bankruptcy. He also has engaged in various online
self-help courses. It was not until after the failure of his second Chapter 13 petition that
he took further action to resolve his debts. (GX 2; Tr. 59 – 63, 90)
Applicant’s father died  in December 2019. Sometime  in 2021, Applicant learned
that his father had left him an inheritance of about $70,000. That money is being managed
by Applicant’s mother, who provided him with the funds (a total of about $23,000) to pay
the IRS and credit card debts at SOR 1.a and 1.c, respectively. Applicant testified he used
another $15,000 of the inheritance to pay off the loan for the vehicle he currently drives.
He also has been drawing from those funds to improve his financial stability and claimed
to  have  prepaid  his  renter’s  and  car  insurance  policies,  and  other  routine  monthly
expenses in advance. As to the car repossession debts at SOR 1.d and 1.e, Applicant
resumed his efforts to contact those creditors but has not yet been able to  progress in
resolving those debts. He has made arrangements to repay other debts not alleged in the
SOR. (AX Z; AX AA; Tr. 42 – 44, 59, 79 – 81, 90 – 91, 98 – 99)
Applicant’s  finances  have  improved  recently.  While  he  still  pays  $1,200  each
month  in  child  support,  he  no  longer  is  required  to  pay  $800  in  spousal  support.
Additionally, in March 2021, he began receiving a monthly disability benefit of $725 from
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). After regular monthly expenses, he estimates
he  has  about  $1,500  remaining  for  debt  repayments  or  savings.  Applicant  has  not
incurred any new delinquencies since the SOR debts became delinquent, and there is no
indication he has ever missed payments on his spousal and child support obligations. (Tr.
74 – 78, 81 – 83)
Applicant  files  his  annual  income  tax  returns  as  required.  For  reasons  already
stated, the only time he has not paid his taxes on time was in 2015 for the 2014 tax year.
In his 2019 Chapter 13 petition, there is an entry showing debts for both the 2014 and
2018 tax years. As to the 2018 tax year, available information shows that he actually owed
$809 for that year. Applicant testified that he is unaware of any such debt and there is no
other information in the record that would suggest  he did not pay his income taxes for
2018. (GX 6; AX B; AX M – U; Tr. 48 – 56, 64 – 68, 73 – 74)
Applicant received several awards and commendation while he was on active duty,
including multiple Good Conduct, Army Commendation, and Army Achievement Medals.
He  also  was  named  Non-commissioned  Officer  of  the  Year  (NCOY)  for  two  different
commands. In civilian life, he has been a solid performer for his current employer. He also
has a good reputation among current and former associates for reliability, commitment to
his assigned duties, and for good character. (AX G – J; Tr. 29 – 35)
