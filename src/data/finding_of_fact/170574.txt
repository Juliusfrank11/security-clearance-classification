Applicant  is  a  43-year-old  electrical  engineer  for  a  government  contractor,
employed since November 2018. He previously consistently worked for other companies
from  2013  to  2018.  He  was  unemployed  from  August  to  October  2013,  from  June  to
August  2010,  and from  June  to  September 2009.  He  earned  an  associate’s degree  in
2004  and  a  bachelor’s degree  in  2008.  He  served  honorably  in  the  U.S.  Marine  Corps
from 1998 to 2003, including  a deployment at sea in December 2002 and  in Iraq from
March to August 2003. He married in 2002 and has three children (ages 21, 19, and 2)
that reside with him. He does not currently hold a security clearance.
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to timely file his federal
income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2012  through  2015  (SOR  ¶  1.a);  is  indebted  to  the
Federal Government for unpaid income taxes for at least tax year 2012 for approximately
$14,000  (SOR  ¶  1.b);  and  is  indebted  for  collection  accounts  totaling  approximately
$2,444  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c  –  1.h).  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations,  with
explanations. The Government’s exhibits support the Guideline F allegations.
Applicant worked as a civilian contractor in Afghanistan from 2012 to August 2013.
During that period, he had poor Internet connections and telephone connectivity. He has
resided in the U.S. since August 2013. While he was deployed, he provided his spouse
with a “power of attorney” so that she could file their income tax returns in his absence,
but  she  was  uncomfortable  with  it.  Applicant  failed  to  file  tax  returns  for  tax  year  (TY)
2012, presumably while he was deployed, but also for TY 2013 – 2015. He testified that
he believes he sought an extension to file his tax returns, but he did not complete the
returns by the extension date. He noted in testimony that “honestly, I don’t remember . . .
why we dropped the ball on that. I honestly don’t remember what the reasoning was.” (Tr.
p. 23)
Applicant was interviewed for his security clearance by a Government investigator
in May 2019. In the interview, he stated that he had not filed his 2012 Federal income tax
return because of his deployment to Afghanistan, and he needed to hire an accountant.
He stated that he owed about $6,000, and he intended to file and pay what he owed.
Applicant  filed  his  2012  income  tax  return  in  October  2019.  In  response  to
Government  interrogatories  dated  November  4,  2019,  he  noted  that  he  owed
approximately $14,000 for 2012  and had not yet filed tax returns for 2013 to 2015.  He
testified that he was motivated to resolve his tax issues by “the notion of getting penalties,
and I just need to pay. It’s just part of the due diligence and one of my responsibilities.”
In October 2019, Applicant hired an attorney to interact with the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) regarding his taxes. The IRS agreed to waive penalties for taxes owed for
tax  year  (TY)  2012,  but  no  repayment  agreement  was  made  with  the  IRS  to  resolve
Applicant’s tax debts. Applicant eventually filed his FY 2013, 2014, and 2015 tax returns
in December 2019, along with partial payments. In March 2020, he completed payments
for taxes owed for TY 2014; and in May and October 2020, he made two $500 payments
toward his TY 2015 debt. In November 2020, he received an IRS notice of intent to seize
(levy) his property unless he paid $2,283 toward his TY 2015 debt. In August 2021, he
paid the IRS $2,333 toward his TY 2015 debt.
Applicant testified at the hearing that he had savings accounts containing about
$6,300;  checking  accounts  containing  about  $2,200;  equity  in  a  home  and  IRA/401k
accounts. His household income was about $140,000 annually. In December 2021, after
the hearing in this case, he paid the IRS $19,281 for the TY 2012 debt (substantially more
than the $14,000 he claimed he owed); $12,511 for the TY 2013 debt; and $603 for his
TY 2020 debt. He provided a checking account statement showing a balance of $68,665
before paying the IRS debts. It is unclear where he obtained the additional cash since his
testimony on November 30, 2021.
The remaining SOR collection accounts, including a judgment debt in SOR ¶ 1.c,
were  settled  and  paid in  2020.  Applicant  was  unable  to  locate the creditor for the  $88
medical collection account in SOR ¶ 1.h, however the debt no longer appears on his credit
report.
Applicant provided successful performance evaluations and training and various
letters  of  recommendation  and  support  attesting  to  his  honesty,  professionalism,
dedication, loyalty, and trustworthiness.
