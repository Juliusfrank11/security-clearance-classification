Applicant admitted SOR allegation ¶ 1.b and denied SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c,
1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. She is 38 years old. She graduated from high school in 2001, and she
earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in 2005 and  a master’s degree  in 2018. As of her October
2020  SCA,  she  was  working  towards  obtaining  a  doctorate  degree  from  a  foreign
university. She married in 2011 and divorced in 2013. As of the date of the hearing, she
was single and did not have any children. She has owned a home since 2017. (Answer;
Tr. at 114-115, 153, 189; GE 1, 4, 6; AE A, B, I, M, Q, S, V, Y, DD)
Applicant previously held a secret clearance in 2012 and a top secret clearance in
2017.  As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  she  was  a  consultant  for  her  employer,  a  DOD
contractor,  since  late  2015,  and  she  has  supported  contracts  under  AGA  through  her
employment.  Under  one  such  contract,  Applicant  underwent  AGA’s  security  clearance
process,  completed  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  in  January  2016,  and  was
twice  polygraphed  by  AGA,  first,  on  December  7  (first  polygraph),  and  second,  on
December  13  (second  polygraph),  2017.  AGA  denied  her  security  clearance  in  June
2018, due to concerns involving sexual behavior, criminal conduct, and personal conduct.
She appealed AGA’s denial of her clearance in July 2018, and AGA’s clearance denial
was upheld on appeal in October 2018. (Answer; Tr. at 6, 140-150, 190; GE 1, 3, 4, 5, 6;
AE E, F, G, H, L, U, DD)
In  December 2018, Applicant completed  another  SCA  as part of  her acceptance
as a  direct commission  in a  U.S. military  command. She  disclosed  the  2018  AGA  denial
of   her  clearance   that  was  upheld  on   appeal.  In   January   2019,  in   support  of   another
contract   under  AGA,  Applicant   underwent  AGA’s  waiver  process;  AGA   granted   her  a
waiver in approximately  August  2020; and  Applicant  worked  on  the  contract  under  AGA
for over one  year.  In  October  2020,  she  completed  another  SCA when  her  employer  re-
nominated   her  for  another  AGA   contract.   She  disclosed   the   2018   AGA   denial  of   her
clearance  that was upheld on  appeal  and  her receipt  of  the  February  2020  DOD SOR. As
of  the  date  of  the  hearing, she  was still  undergoing   AGA’s security   clearance  process.
(Answer; Tr. at  6, 140-150, 190; GE 1; AE  I, N, O, Q, U, DD)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant:  (1)  worked  as  a  prostitute  from  approximately
2004  to  April  2007  (SOR  ¶  1.b);  (2)  engaged  in  an  affair  with  a  married  man  from
approximately 2007 to 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.c); (3) married her former spouse in approximately
February 2011, so that he could collect additional housing allowance from the U.S. Navy
under fraudulent circumstances (SOR ¶ 1.a); and (4) joined a “sugar baby arrangement”
website  on  around  February  2015,  and  received  approximately  $400  that  Spring  from
someone she met through the website (SOR ¶ 1.d).
The SOR also alleged that Applicant used marijuana in 2012 and in approximately
February 2014,  while  possessing a  clearance  (SOR  ¶  1.f). The  SOR  also  alleged  that
Applicant falsified material facts on her January 2016 SCA, when she deliberately failed
to  disclose  her  2012  and  2014  marijuana  use  and  answered  “No”  in  response  to  the
following:
Section  23  - Illegal Use  of Drugs or Drug  Activity  .  . .  Illegal Use  of Drugs or
Controlled  Substances  In  the  last  seven  (7) years, have  you  illegally  used
any drugs or controlled substances? Use  of a  drug or controlled substance
includes  injecting,  snorting,  inhaling,  swallowing,  experimenting   with   or
otherwise  consuming   any   drug   or  controlled   substance?   .  .  .   While
Possessing   a   Security   Clearance   Have   you   EVER   illegally   used   or
otherwise  been   involved   with   a   drug   or  controlled   substance   while
possessing a security clearance other than  previously listed?
(SOR ¶ 1.e; GE 6)
The  SOR  allegations  are  established  by  Applicant’s  admissions  in  her  Answer;
Applicant’s SCA’s from 2016, 2018, and 2020; AGA’s December 2017 reports from her
first and second polygraphs; AGA’s 2018 clearance decision statement; Applicant’s July
2018 appeal of AGA’s clearance denial; and Applicant’s hearing testimony. (Answer; Tr.
at 113-192; GE 1, 3, 4, 5, 6; AE E, F, G, I, DD)
Applicant  became  curious  about prostitution when  she  attended an all-woman’s
college. She testified:
[W]e   focused   a   lot  on   women’s  labor,  women’s  economics,  the   roles
education,   businesses   played   in  the   development  and   empowerment  of
women,  and   just   the   different  waves  of   feminism   that  women   experience
based on their socioeconomic backgrounds.
(Tr. at 115; GE 1, 3, 5, 6; AE E, F, I, Z, DD)
Applicant’s curiosity  led  her to first experiment with  prostitution  in 2004,  through  a
college  classmate  who  was a  “madam,” responsible  for organizing  the  “meetings between
the  client and  the  escorts.”   On  this occasion, the  madam  told Applicant about a  client;
Applicant confirmed  her interest; Applicant  was driven  to  the  client’s house,  and  “I had
my  one  hour and  then  I ended  the  night.  I was driven  back home.” (Tr. at 115-126, 177-
178, 190; GE 3,  5; AE  E, F)
Applicant next experimented  with  prostitution  in approximately  late  2006  to  early
2007, when  she  moved  to  state  A.  She  testified  that she  was  interested,  “from a  research
perspective,”  with  how  prostitution  worked  in state  A.  Initially, she  was connected  with  a
“madam,”   who   linked   Applicant   with   clients  on   two   separate   occasions.   She   then
independently  advertised  her sexual services at  an  hourly  rate  of $300,  and  engaged  in
prostitution  approximately  25  times until around  April 2007.  In  the  interest  of  safety, she
always met  her clients  at  a  hotel  and  not her  personal  residence.  (Tr.  at  115-126,  177-
178, 190-191; GE 3,  5; AE E, F)
Applicant testified that she did not disclose her 2004 and 2006 to 2007 involvement
with  prostitution  during  her  2016  interview  with  a  background  investigator  or  her  first
polygraph and the pre-test interview, because she incorrectly assumed that the timeframe
was beyond the relevant seven-year scope of interest. The ROI summarizing Applicant’s
2016 interview with a background investigator, marked as GE 7, is not in evidence. She
also testified that she was “. . . under a lot of stress . . . very much afraid. . .” during both
polygraphs,  having  never  previously  been  polygraphed.  She  testified  that  the  first
polygraph  lasted  four  hours  and  she  took  only one  break,  at  her request.  She  did  not
communicate to anyone, during the first polygraph, that she felt stressed. She conveyed
her stressful experience to her facility security officer (FSO) after her first polygraph was
completed. She knew the polygraphs were a part of her security clearance processing
with AGA. (Tr. at 115-126, 157-176, 179-187, 190; GE 3, 4, 5; AE E, F)
Applicant returned for a second polygraph because AGA told her she did not pass
the  lifestyle  portion  of  the  first  polygraph.  She  disclosed  her  2004  and  2006  to  2007
involvement  with  prostitution  during  her  second  polygraph,  to  include  the  pre-test
interview. She disputed the indications contained in the second polygraph report, that: (1)
she had read the first polygraph report and deemed it accurate, and (2) she was unable
to successfully complete the first polygraph because she was not ready to fully discuss
her involvement in the sex-work industry. She testified that: (1) she was not given a copy
of the first polygraph report to read, but rather, “they just read it to me,” and (2) she would
have been able to continue the first polygraph and discuss her 2004 to 2007 involvement
with prostitution if she had more time, but reiterated that it was already at the four-hour
mark when it concluded. In her July 2018 appeal of AGA’s clearance denial, she rebutted
the indications contained in the second polygraph report that characterized her as having
engaged in prostitution from 2004 to 2017. She maintained that she “. . . didn’t do the sex
work the entire time.” (Tr. at 115-126, 157-176, 179-187, 190; GE 3, 4, 5; AE E, F, G, DD)
Applicant  denied  the  indication,  contained  in  the  ROI  summarizing  her  2019
interview with a background investigator, that she concealed information about her past
involvement with prostitution  during her 2016 interview with a background investigator,
because  she  was  afraid  it  would  affect  her  ability  to  obtain  a  security  clearance.  As
previously  mentioned,  I  do  not  give  any  weight  to  the  ROI  contained  in  GE  2,  given
Applicant’s indication  that  she  did  not  adopt  this ROI.  Applicant  also denied  indicating,
during  her  second  polygraph,  that  she  tried  to  compartmentalize  her  past  involvement
with prostitution because it was difficult for her to admit that she was a “whore, a sugar
baby.” She compared a “sugar baby arrangement” to “going on a dating app, basically,”
and stated that it is considered “dating” since the parties “enter into a relationship.” She
stated that it is not illegal. She defined a “sugar baby” as:
[A]   person,   male  or  female,  who   engages  in  a   relationship   with   a   more
affluent male  or female. Sometimes  gifts  are  exchanged, but it’s usually  the
more affluent male or female [who] would present gifts to the sugar baby.
(Tr. at 115-126, 135-136, 157-176, 178-187, 190-191; GE 2, 5; AE E, G, J, K, DD)
Through  her  personal  advertisement  for  sexual  services,  Applicant  met  an
individual (Man 1) in approximately April 2007 with whom she engaged in a transactional
relationship for ten weeks. They then decided to explore the potential for a relationship
and Applicant stopped advertising her sexual services. She initially asked Man 1 to pay
her  $10,000  monthly for  her  services  and  companionship,  but  he  declined.  During  the
course  of  their  relationship,  Man  1  gave  Applicant  $4,000  monthly  from  April  to  the
summer  of  2007.  He  then  paid  for  the  remainder  of  her  college  tuition  for  that  spring
semester and the full tuition for the following fall semester. He  gave her money to help
her buy a car, and he gave her approximately $800 monthly to help her pay her rent. In
2013, she moved into a cottage adjacent to his  home and paid him $1,000 monthly in
rent, reduced from the $2,700 monthly market value. They traveled the world.  He gave
her numerous gifts. Applicant stated that Man 1 was her boyfriend, although she knew he
was  married  and  engaging  in  an  extramarital  affair  with  her  at  the  time.  She  felt
“enamored,  happy,  supported,  and  respected”  in  her  relationship  with  him.  Their
relationship ended  in 2015,  when his wife learned about it, but they continued to have
intimate, albeit   “infrequent,”  sexual  relations   until  2017.   (Tr. at  115-126,   157-175, 178-
187, 190-191; GE  1,  3,  4, 5, 6; AE  E, F, G, I, DD)
Applicant testified that she did not disclose her involvement with Man 1 during her
2016 interview with a background investigator because she also believed it was beyond
the  relevant  seven-year  scope  of  interest.  The  ROI  summarizing  Applicant’s  2016
interview with a background investigator, marked as GE 7, is not in evidence. Applicant
reiterated that she was in a state of duress during her first polygraph, and she recanted
statements  reflected  in  the  first  polygraph  report  wherein  she  characterized:  (1)  her
relationship with Man 1 as an “arrangement,” and one that she would have left if he was
not giving her money; (2) herself as the “sugar baby;” and (3) feeling “. . . like a prostitute
who  took  advantage  of  a  man  who  was  willing  to  help  me.”  She  testified  that  her
recantations are contained in the following documents: (1) her 2018 response to AGA’s
SOR; (2) her 2018 appeal of AGA’s clearance denial; and (3) her 2021 interview with a
background investigator. Of these documents, only Applicant’s July 2018 appeal of AGA’s
clearance denial is in evidence.
Applicant acknowledged that she did not make any such recantations during her
second polygraph. She also testified that she disclosed her relationship with Man 1 during
her 2019 interview with a background investigator, but denied telling the investigator that
Man  1  gave  her  $13,000  after  she  asked  Man  1  for  it  out  of  anger.  As  previously
mentioned,  I  do  not  give  any  weight  to  the  ROI  contained  in  GE  2,  given  Applicant’s
indication that she did not adopt this ROI. Applicant  maintained  that although  she and
Man 1 were having an affair, she “felt very much a part of a relationship.” (Tr. at 115-126,
135-139, 157-175, 178-187, 190; GE 2, 3, 4, 5; AE E, F, G, J, K, DD)
Man 1 telephonically testified that he met Applicant in approximately 2006 or 2007,
after  discovering  Applicant’s  profile  advertisement  through  an  online  search  for
prostitutes. He saw Applicant “a few times” over the course of approximately one to two
months in  a  “fee  for services kind  of  exchange.” During  these  occasions, he  estimated
that  he  paid  Applicant  a  flat  fee  of  $200  for  30  minutes  of  services.  Although  he  was
married, he asked Applicant if she could be his girlfriend because he no longer wanted
her to work as a prostitute. They dated for approximately seven to eight years. He saw
Applicant frequently and regularly provided her with financial support. He helped with her
expenses  related  to  her  apartment  rentals,  car  purchase,  education,  and  day-to-day
living.  They  traveled  together  on  numerous  domestic  and  international  trips.  In
approximately 2008,  his  medical  practice  hired  Applicant  as  a  consultant  to  utilize  her
“computer savvy skill set” to improve its social media profiles. He loved Applicant. (Tr. at
44-76)
Man 1 testified that Applicant told him, while they were dating, that she got married
and his relationship with her would be affected by her marriage. He could not recall when
Applicant got married and when her marriage ended. He recalled that Applicant did not
live with her spouse full time. He stated that both his marriage and Applicant’s marriage
had “little effect on our relationship.” (Tr. at 44-76)
In  approximately  January  2015,  Man  1’s  spouse  discovered  he  and  Applicant’s
romantic  relationship.  Applicant  consequently  vacated  the  apartment  she  had  been
renting on his property, and he gave  Applicant approximately $10,000 to help with her
relocation expenses. Their relationship  subsequently dwindled as they saw each other
less  and  he  became  involved  with  another  woman.  Applicant  moved  out  of  state  in
approximately 2017, and Man 1 stated that he had not since seen or provided Applicant
with any assistance, financial or otherwise. Man 1 testified that Applicant never demanded
or attempted to extort him for money. (Tr. at 44-76)
Applicant  met  her  former  spouse  in  2007,  when  they  volunteered  for  the  same
presidential campaign. They were peers first, and then their friendship developed into a
relationship.  They  started  discussing  marriage  in  early  2011.  Applicant  described  their
marriage as an “ethical non-monogamy relationship,” or “an open relationship” with “no
boundaries,” where all parties know and consent and respect boundaries.” She testified
that she “embraced the fluidity of sexuality” and is “bisexual in western lexicon,” and she
was  aware  that  her former spouse  was  unclear  about  his sexuality at  the time  of  their
marriage, which did not deter her. (Tr. at 122-130; GE 1, 4, 6; AE E, I, M, Y, Z, DD)
Applicant’s former spouse  served  in  the  U.S.  military  during  their  marriage. She
testified that they did not have any “explicit conversation,”  during their marriage,  about
how  he  was  paid  as  a  service  member  because  she  was  “fiercely  independent,”  she
earned  an  income,  and  they  maintained  separate  finances.  She  testified  that  they  did
however, discuss during their marriage his receipt of basic allowance for housing (BAH),
which she understood as money he received “as a benefit because he lived “in [state A].”
She testified that she did not purposefully marry him so that he could receive BAH, and
they never discussed marrying so that he could receive BAH. She stated that after their
divorce, she and her former spouse maintained a good relationship, and he moved in with
her, in her then-boyfriend’s cottage, for approximately three to four months in 2014 after
he had been reassigned from state B back to state A. (Tr. at 122-130, 187; AE M, Y)
Applicant   denied   telling   a   background   investigator  in  2016   that  she   married   her
former  spouse   because:  (1)   he   is  “homosexual;”   (2)  he   could   not  marry   his  then-male
partner because  of existing  U.S. military  policy;  and  (3)  he  asked  her to  do  so  to  help him
keep   his  home   by   getting   BAH   for  being   married.   She   also   denied   telling   the   2016
background  investigator that  she  wanted  to  help her former spouse  and  she  did not want
him  to  lose  his  home. She  also denied  telling  the  2016  background  investigator that  if  she
had  to  do  it over again,  she  should  have  told her former spouse  “no.” She  did  not recall
stating  that her former spouse  and  his then-partner asked  a  number  of  single women  to
do   so   and   that  all   the   other  women   said  “no.”   The   ROI  summarizing   Applicant’s  2016
interview  with  a  background  investigator, marked  as  GE  7, is not in evidence. (Tr. at 151-
157; AE M, Y)
Applicant’s former spouse telephonically testified. He met Applicant in 2007, when
they volunteered for the  same  presidential campaign.  He  and  Applicant  became  close
friends during the campaign year and subsequently remained in touch. They married in
2011  and  divorced  in  2013,  and  their  marriage  was  a  “non-exclusive”  one.  He  was
previously married from 2002 to 2004, and he was in the process of divorcing his third
spouse as of the date of the hearing. He also testified that Applicant did not work as a
prostitute during their marriage and recalled that she had stopped such work prior to their
marriage. He testified that Applicant remained one of his best friends. (Tr. at 76-92)
Applicant’s former spouse was an officer in the U.S. military. He testified that  he
never discussed with Applicant, during their marriage, how military pay worked and thus,
he did not believe she understood it. In 2011, when he was stationed in state A, he lived
in a condominium that he purchased before he married Applicant. He testified that he was
never delinquent on his mortgage. He received a $2,400 monthly housing allowance from
the U.S. military, which included Applicant as his wife and dependent, and he used the
housing allowance to pay for his monthly mortgage of approximately $2,800. He testified
that Applicant did not live with him in the condominium because her commute to where
she worked was too lengthy. (Tr. at 85- 92)
joined  a
In  February  2015,  Applicant
“sugar  baby”  website  called
“SeekingArrangement.com.”  She  testified  that  she  did  so  to  “meet  new  people  and  to
date,” and denied doing so to meet prospects who were affluent or who could provide her
with financial benefits. She met an individual through the website (Man 2) and stated, “We
had great conversations. Our talking on e-mails, it was very engaging.” When they met
for the first time, for lunch, “[w]e got along” and lunched for two hours. She testified that
after lunch:
[H]e  presented a  gift of $100  and  I  thought that was sweet and  generous. I
thought  we   connected   really   well.  And,  you   know,  it  looked   like   we  were
going   to  have  a   second  date. And   so   I was like,  why  don’t you   just   come
over to  my  place;  I’ll  make  dinner for  you. Let’s have  a  good  time.  And  he
came  over; we  had  a  great time  for several hours. I thought we  were hitting
it  off.  I  thought  this  might  lead   to   a   third   date   as   well.  We   engaged   in
consensual sex. And  then  he  left  money  outside  in the  kitchen  and  he  left,
and  I was a bit -- yes. He left.
(Tr. at 137-139, 172-176, 178-179, 190-191; GE 3, 5; AE E, F, G, DD)
Applicant  reported  this  encounter  during  her  second  polygraph.  The  second
polygraph report reflects that Applicant described the “sugar baby” website as “a Bumble
but for the arrangement lifestyle.” The  report also reflects that Applicant confirmed that
being  a  member  of  the  site  implied  a  willingness  to  be  in  an  “arrangement.”  Applicant
testified that she did not find it unusual that Man 2 gave her $100 after their lunch. She
described it as “social collectivism, just making sure everyone is okay.” She testified that
she clarified a statement she made during her second polygraph, that she was surprised
when Man 2 gave her money after their lunch because they had not yet had sex, and that
she realized he was a “john,” or a client seeking a prostitute’s services. She testified that
she meant to say that the money Man 2 left her was “just a  gift.” She testified  that she
made  this  clarification  in  her:  (1)  July  2018  appeal  of  AGA’s  clearance  denial;  (2)
“rebuttals in 2018, 19’ and ’20;” and (3) 2021 interview with a background investigator. Of
these  documents,  only  Applicant’s  July  2018  appeal  of  AGA’s  clearance  denial,  her
November  2019  response  to  DOD  interrogatories,  and  her  Answer,  are  in  evidence.
(Answer; Tr. at 137-139; 172-176, 190-191; GE 2, 3, 5; AE E, F, G, J, K, DD)
Applicant testified that she found Man 2’s gesture of leaving her money after sex
as “. . . pretty insulting and embarrassing. I misread it . . ..” She testified that she did not
have any discussions with Man 2 about a pay-for-services arrangement, and stated that
she “took it as a dating -- a potential relationship. I thought we would go on a third date.”
She stated that she would not have invited Man 2 to her personal residence, for safety
reasons, if she intended to act as a prostitute. She stated that they subsequently had no
further  contact.  She  testified  that  she  recanted  an  assumption  she  made  when  she
indicated, during her second polygraph, that she knew the $300 Man 2 left her was for
the  sex  they  had  and  she  therefore  spent  it  right  away,  and  that  she  rebutted  this
assumption in her “response to the SORs in 2018, 2019, and 2020.” Of these documents,
only  Applicant’s  July  2018  appeal  of  AGA’s  clearance  denial,  her  November  2019
response to DOD interrogatories, and her Answer are in evidence.  She testified that she
has not since joined any such similar website, and she had no future intentions of doing
so. (Tr. at 137-139; 172-176, 189-191; Answer; GE 2, 3, 5; AE E, F, G, J, K, DD)
Applicant  used  marijuana  three  times:  (1)  in  2008,  she  ate  a  marijuana  cookie
because she was curious; (2) in 2012, she smoked marijuana; and (3) in 2014, she ate
another marijuana cookie. After she used marijuana in 2014, she felt that she did not need
marijuana in her life. She testified that she has no future intent to use marijuana. (Tr. at
130-135, 160, 187; GE 1, 4, 5; AE E, F, I)
The  first polygraph  report reflects  Applicant’s  disclosure of  only  her 2014  marijuana
use.  It  also  reflects  that Applicant  referred to her ingestion of a  marijuana  cookie  in 2014
as  unintentional, because  she  did  not know  that her former spouse and  his partner, who
were living  with  her at the  time, made  marijuana  cookies.  The  second  polygraph  report
reflects Applicant’s disclosure of  her 2012  and  2014  marijuana  use.  It  reflects that she:
(1) did not discuss her 2012  marijuana  use  during  her first polygraph, because  she  was
embarrassed  that she  had used  marijuana while she was unknowingly pregnant; and (2)
knowingly   ingested   a   marijuana   cookie  in   2014,   but  did   not  discuss  such   knowledge
because  she  was concerned  that the  recency  of  her use  would have  a  negative  impact
on her security processing. (GE 4, 5; AE E)
Applicant testified that she unknowingly held a security clearance when she used
marijuana  in  2012  and  2014.  She  testified  that  when  she  worked  as  a  conference
organizer for a DOD contracting company in state A, she did so only for the summer of
2012,  as  further  discussed  below.  She  testified  that  although  she  completed  an  SCA
under  the  company’s  sponsorship  that  summer,  she  did  not  know  the  outcome  of  her
security clearance processing because she last spoke to the company’s owner when the
conference concluded. She testified that she was unaware she was granted a security
clearance in 2012 until she began working for her current employer in 2015. She testified
that she contacted the company’s owner in 2020 to ask when her security clearance was
granted after her completion of the 2012 SCA, because she needed to list this information
on her 2020 SCA, and his response was that he would “look into it.” Applicant disclosed,
in  her  2016,  2018  and  2020  SCA’s,  that  she  was  granted  a  security  clearance  in
December  2012.  She   listed   that  the   investigation   was  completed   in  approximately
September  2012;  she   was  granted   a   “Secret”  clearance   in   approximately   December
2012; and  that “It was from  US Pacific Command  J92.” (Tr. at 130-135; GE  1, 6; AE  I,

The president and owner of the state-A-based DOD contracting company in which
Applicant worked in the summer of 2012 telephonically testified. He met Applicant that
summer  when a federal customer proposed  that Applicant might  be  able to assist  him
with  an  international  conference  hosted  by  his  company.  He  hired  Applicant  as  an
independent consultant for the eight-week duration of the conference, from approximately
August to September 2012. She did not need a security clearance during this time, but
he  recalled  that  his  company  sponsored  her  for  one  because  it  hoped  to  hire  her
permanently after the conference’s conclusion. He stated that company records reflected
that Applicant completed an SCA in August 2012. He did not recall informing Applicant
that  he  was  her  FSO.  He  also  did  not  recall  having  any  further  communication  with
Applicant  after  the  conference  ended  in  September  2012,  to  include  any  discussions
about the status of her clearance, because the opportunity to hire her permanently did
not pan out. He testified that he did not believe Applicant had any knowledge that her
clearance  continued  to  be  processed  after  she  stopped  working  for  his  company  that
September.  He  also  testified  that  he  did  not  recall  being  notified,  through  the  Joint
Personnel Adjudication System, whether Applicant’s clearance had been granted, and he
could not recall whether Applicant was granted an interim security clearance in the short
time she worked for him. He testified that he only recently communicated with Applicant
in 2020, when she sent him an email asking whether he recalled the outcome of her 2012
security clearance processing. (Tr. at 92-113; AE C, D, AA-CC)
Applicant acknowledged she did not disclose her marijuana use on her 2016 SCA.
She attributed her failure to do so to poor judgment, stating she was scared of the adverse
impact such a disclosure would have on her security clearance eligibility. In her 2018 and
2020  SCA’s, Applicant  disclosed all three  occasions  in  which  used marijuana  and she
marked “Yes,” to the questions  that inquired whether her marijuana use occurred while
possessing a security clearance. In both SCA’s, she maintained that she did not know the
outcome  of  her  2012  security  clearance  processing  until  she  began  working  for  her
current employer in 2015. At that point, her employer informed her that she already had
a clearance that was about to expire. (Tr. at 130-135, 150-152, 187-190; GE 1, 6; AE I,

An  individual  who  served  as  Applicant’s  administrative  career  manager  from
February 2017 until December 2020, when Applicant was transferred to another program,
testified  in  person. This  witness  was  a  deputy  program  manager  as  of  the  date  of  the
hearing,  and  worked  for  the  same  employer  as  Applicant  since  2011.  She  ranked
Applicant  among  the  top  15%  of  employees  she  has  supervised.  She  stated  that
Applicant’s immediate supervisors favorably reviewed Applicant during the period when
Applicant was under her management, and that Applicant was promoted in approximately
2019. The witness testified that she was aware Applicant held a top secret clearance in
2017, and then was denied  clearance eligibility after a full-scope polygraph  by AGA in
approximately 2018, due to prior issues involving prostitution. The witness also testified
10
that she was aware Applicant was granted a waiver by AGA because the client wanted
Applicant on its project. The witness testified that Applicant openly told her, after Applicant
failed her first polygraph in December 2017, about Applicant’s prior voluntary work as a
prostitute  as  a  source  of  income.  The  witness  described  Applicant  as  “incredibly
hardworking” and  a  valued  data  scientist, which was “a  skill set  that’s hard  to  find  and
[Applicant] excelled with all of the products that she supported . . ..” (Tr. at 22-44; AE U)

An
the
individual  who  presented  himself  as  an  expert
fields  of
counterintelligence, insider threat, counterterrorism,  and cyber security  within the DOD
and  U.S.  intelligence  community,  and  an  officer  in  the  U.S.  military  with  experience  in
national security law, was hired by Applicant as an independent subject-matter-expert to
draft an expert witness report on her behalf. He wrote, in his June 2020 report, that he
closely examined  Applicant’s case  and was of the opinion that Applicant mitigated any
personal conduct, sexual behavior, and criminal conduct security concerns. He wrote that
Applicant made a prompt and good-faith effort to correct her omissions and had taken
positive  steps  to  reduce  vulnerabilities  associated  with  her  past  misconduct.  He  also
wrote  that  her  past  acts  of  misconduct  were  isolated  events  from  which  she  had
rehabilitated, taken complete accountability, and demonstrated that she was committed
to no longer engaging in such behavior. He concluded that she is “fit to maintain a security
clearance.” (AE P)
A  number  of  character  references  attested
to  Applicant’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness. One reference, who referred  to Applicant as a colleague and a friend,
wrote that he has known Applicant since 2015. He noted Applicant’s dedication, both in
her community and at work, to mentorship in the area of programming. Another reference,
who was Applicant’s college advisor and professor, wrote that she has known Applicant
since 2001. This reference wrote that she thought “very well of  [Applicant’s] intellectual
abilities,” and described her as an honest, mature, and highly productive person. Another
reference, who served as Applicant’s second-level manager from 2017 to at least 2021,
described  Applicant  as  innovative,  with  a  strong  commitment  to  learning  and  helping
others  learn.  Applicant’s  employer  has  rewarded  her  for  her  strong  work  ethic  and
passionate service. Applicant has participated extensively in volunteer and charity efforts
in  her  community.  She  has  several  publications,  to  include  one  involving  her  work  in
programming. (AE R, S, T, U, W, X)
