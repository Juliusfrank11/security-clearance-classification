Applicant  is  a  53-year-old  senior  engineer  and  supervisor  for  a  government
contractor,  employed  since  September  2019.  He  previously  worked  for  the  same
company  from  2004  to  2009;  he  was  unemployed  from  2009  to  2016  due  to  medical
problems,  and  worked  for  another  defense  contractor  from  October  2016  to  February
2018, but left because he suffered from vertigo. He was employed from July to October
2018 as a contract employee for his current company, and was unemployed until being
rehired in September 2019. He also owned an unprofitable company from 2011 to 2019.
He  honorably  served  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from  1986  to  1988.  He  married  in  1991  and
divorced in 1996. He remarried in 2000 and has four children, ages 23, 22, 19, and 17.
The youngest two children live with him. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1999, started
a  master’s program  in 2016, but stopped  after discovering his spouse’s infidelity. He  is
currently enrolled in a master’s program at a university where he lives, and plans to begin
another program at another university. He currently holds a secret security clearance.
The SOR alleges  under Guideline F  that  Applicant filed  a Chapter 7  bankruptcy in
February  that  was discharged  in June  1995;  he  filed  a  Chapter 13  bankruptcy  in 2019
that  was dismissed  in  June  2020  (SOR ¶¶  1.a  –  1.c).  Applicant  admitted  these  allegations.
SOR ¶¶  1.d  –  1.f  allege  student loan  collection  accounts totaling  about $68,871. SOR ¶
1.g  alleges a  past-due  car loan  for $2,667, with  a  total  balance  due  of  $33,805.  SOR  ¶¶
1.h  –  1.j allege  state  tax  liens totaling  about $47,549. SOR ¶¶  1.k and  1.l are tax  debts
owed  to  the  Federal government totaling  about $84,254; and  SOR ¶¶  1.m  and  1.n  allege
unpaid judgments totaling  about $43,238. Applicant denied  SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.d  –  1.n.
Applicant stated that he suffered from a back injury in 1983 and a football injury in
1985. However, he served in the Navy from 1986 to 1998. In 2010 he was having trouble
walking after kidney stone surgery, and from 2011-2016 could not work due to his injuries.
He stated that his spine was rebuilt in 2013 and he was unable to walk. After six months,
he started working part time and his spouse worked full time. He believed he had financial
issues  during this time,  but  was  not aware  of  the  extent since his spouse  handled the
family finances. (GE 6) He began full-time employment again in 2016 until he suffered
from  vertigo  and  was  released  in  2018.  In  2018,  he  began  consulting  with  his  current
employer, but  left the contract  in October 2018  after being injured in  a  car accident  in
September  2018.  No  independent  documentary  information  confirming  Applicant’s
medical  conditions,  inability  to  work,  and  his  personal  company’s  finances  were
submitted.
Applicant first filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1995 after his spouse at the time left
him with bills that he could not pay. He started school and was permitted to live with his
parents but only if he filed bankruptcy. The bankruptcy was discharged in 1995 and he
divorced his first spouse in 1996.
Of  note,  Applicant  did  not  discuss  any  marital  discord  with  his  current  spouse
during his hearing and claimed that he and his spouse were not separated, but she was
living in state A. When interviewed in 2017, he told the investigator he could not answer
his  phone  because  his  spouse  had  “confiscated”  his  cell  phone.  He  also  traveled  to
Mexico with his spouse to visit her family, but she did not return with him and he was not
sure she would return. He noted that they were not getting along, and therefore, he was
unable to provide financial information. When he asked her about finances, she “only yells
at him” and she “is taking all the money from their joint account” and he “can only assume
that she is paying bills.” He and his spouse are not separated, but he noted during the
interview that he did not think their car or mortgage payments were being made. In 2016,
he caught her having an affair with another man, and in 2017, Applicant and his spouse
had a physical altercation over his accusations that she was visiting dating websites. (GE
6)
Applicant purchased a home in state A in 2006. He noted in his 2017 interview that
he had not made a payment on his mortgage since 2010. (GE 6) More recently, he was
notified  in  2019  that  the  home  would  be  foreclosed  on.  In  an  effort  to  forestall  the
foreclosure,  he  filed  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  in  September  2019  to  force  the  mortgage
company to restructure or modify the mortgage. He lives in State B, and stated that he is
trying  to  “get my  family  out of  the  house  in [State  A] so  that it can  be  sold.” (Ans.)  He
claimed  $555,651  in  secured  payments,  and  $189,004  in  unsecured  payments.  No
principal or interest was paid. (GE 2) The bankruptcy was dismissed in June 2020.
SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.e  involve  student  loans.  Applicant  obtained  student  loans  in
1995 to 1999 that were later consolidated. He did not begin to pay them until 2009. While
unemployed,  he  did  not  contact  his  loan  servicing  companies  regarding  his  financial
status and  left  his student loans  unaddressed from 2009 to 2020. He  testified that the
loans are now rehabilitated and current. He claimed that he has been paying on the loans
since 2019, and that they are not currently in default. Applicant provided a  letter from a
loan  servicing  company  alleged  in  the  SOR,  dated  October  29,  2021,  stating  that  his
rehabilitated loan has been with student loan servicer N for a few months, and they were
inquiring to see if he had “what you need to stay on track repaying your federal student
loan.” (AE I) He testified that he made his first payment in December 2021, and will start
automatic payments of $360 per month in January 2022, but he was unsure of the exact
amount.  After  the  hearing,  he  provided  a  personal  budget  showing  a  $350  allocation
toward student loans. No financial records of actual payments or a current status of his
student  loan  accounts  were  submitted.  (AE  M)  Applicant  denied  knowledge  of  a
Department  of  Education  (DOE)  collection  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.f  but  said  he  would
research  it.  He  testified  that  he  called  the  DOE  in  late  December  2021,  and  left  a
message, but has not contacted them since and remains unaware of the DOE debt. His
2017 credit report shows a DOE deferred student loan, and his 2021 credit report shows
the DOE account in collections with $6,300 past due. (GEs 4 and 5)
Regarding SOR ¶ 1.g that alleges a past-due car loan, Applicant noted in his 2017
interview,  that he purchased  a car in 2008, but that he had not made a payment on it
since 2010. (GE 6) He testified that the SOR debt was for a car loan for his spouse, and
the car was destroyed. He claimed the insurance company took the car and paid the loan.
Applicant listed the debt in his Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing, but has not inquired about
the status of the loan with the creditor. Applicant’s February 2021 credit report shows he
was  about  four  payments  past  due  at  that  time,  and  owes  a  total  of  $33,805.  No
independent  documentation  showing  the  current  status  of  the  loan  or  any  insurance
payoff was provided.
SOR ¶¶ 1.h – 1.j allege state tax liens from two states, and SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.l are
tax  debts  owed  to  the  Federal  government.  Applicant  was  aware  of  the  debts  in
September 2019 as they were included in his Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing.  He testified
that he was taxed in each state that has filed liens, but did not believe he owed taxes. He
claimed that he lived in state B from 2004 to 2006, and was aware of his tax obligations
in  2016.  He  claimed  his  income  taxes  were  paid  by  a  consulting  company.  He
acknowledged living and working in state A from 2006 to 2019, and failed to file state A
income tax returns for tax years 2006 to 2009. He claimed a tax preparer told him in 2016
or 2017 that he did not have to file returns that were over 10 years old.
Applicant testified that he did not have income in 2010 or 2011, so he did not file
any tax returns. He claimed he filed state and Federal tax returns in 2012, but did not
remember if he owed any tax, but believes he always received a refund from returns that
were filed. He also testified that he believes he filed Federal tax returns for tax years 2013
to 2020, and thinks he received refunds. He claimed that he has paid Federal taxes owed,
but did not provide IRS transcripts or other evidence of payments. Applicant’s 2017 credit
report shows tax liens since 2010. (GE 5) He could not recall getting any tax debt notices.
Of  note,  Applicant’s financial plan, submitted  after the  hearing, shows his denial  of tax
debt allegations, but does not explain any action taken with regard to the debts. He also
does not have an allocation toward tax debts in his budget. He testified that he found out
in 2016 that he did not file Federal and state tax returns from 2006 to 2009. He spoke to
state A tax authority the week of his hearing, and said he made arrangements to resubmit
unfiled tax returns. He stated that he intends to refile tax returns for 2006 to 2009 in state
A, 2005 or 2006 in state B, and 2005 to 2009 Federal returns after the hearing. After the
hearing,  Applicant  submitted  a  copy  of  a  check  for  $1,047,  dated  January  2,  2022,
apparently written to pay a state A tax assessment from November 4, 2021. (AE L) No
information confirming that tax authority’s receipt of payment was submitted.
SOR ¶¶ 1.m and 1.n allege two judgments. (GE 5) One for a mobile-home loan
that he purchased for his wife in another state while they were separated. He stopped
making  payments  in  2011  and  he  assumed  the  home  was  repossessed  and  the  loan
foreclosed. He did not believe he owed any remaining balance. However, he had done
nothing to address the debt or confirm its status. The other judgment was for a finance
company debt. He testified that he was unaware of the judgment or the basis of the debt,
but had not contacted the creditor nor made any effort to determine its status.
Applicant  provided  several  character  letters  from  coworkers,  a  long-standing
friend, and his son who is serving in the Navy, attesting to the importance of his job, his
loyalty, and the lack of security incidents or other behaviors that would make him a risk
to national security. Of note, the letters appear to use similar language and format, and
none discuss his financial history. He also provided many educational and employment
awards  and  certificates.  He  has  cash  assets  of  about  $6,000  to  $8,000,  and  a  401k
retirement account valued at $70,000, however he borrowed $7,000 to $10,000 from it in
2020. He had financial counseling in 1995 and presumably in 2019, coincident with his
bankruptcy filings.
