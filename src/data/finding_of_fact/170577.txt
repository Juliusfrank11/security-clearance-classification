Applicant is 35-years-old and has been with his partner since September 2013. He
was  previously  married  and  divorced  two  times  (September  2006  to  April  2007  and
September 2008 to March 2013). He has a ten-year-old daughter with his second wife
and an almost seven-year old daughter and a four-year-old son with his current partner.
She has a 13-year-old daughter from previous relationship who lives with them. (GE 1;
Tr. at 10-12, 104)
Applicant  received  an  associate’s  degree  in  general  studies  in  2010  and  a
bachelor’s  degree  in  business  administration  in  2012.  Between  2008  and  2017,  he
worked as a dual-status technician, serving in the Army National Guard (ARNG) and as
a civilian employee for the Department of the Army (DOA). He was honorably discharged
as  a  staff  sergeant,  after  serving  multiple  deployments  to  Iraq,  Jordan,  Kuwait,  and
Germany. His last role for the DOA was as a staff accountant. He has worked as a senior
financial accounting analyst for his current employer, a Defense contractor, since August
2020. He has held a secret security clearance since 2008. (GE 1; Tr. at 10-12, 25-26, 79,
86-87, 112-113)
Applicant’s multiple  ARNG deployments negatively  affected  his second  marriage,
and  his oldest daughter was less than  a  year old when  he  deployed  to  Iraq  for a  year-
long   tour.  Applicant  and   his  second   wife   divorced   in  2013   following   his  return   from   a
deployment,   and   he   was  court-ordered   to   pay   $1,200   monthly   in  child   support  for  his
oldest  daughter.  The  child  support  payments  were almost  half  of  his  take  home  pay. He
was also responsible  for all  of  their  marital debt, including  the  mortgage  for their  home.
These   debts   totaled  more  than  $50,000,   not including   the   outstanding   balance   of   their
mortgage. (GE  1; Tr. 27-31, 104-105)
Shortly   after  his  second   divorce,   Applicant  entered   into   a   relationship  with   his
current partner. Her daughter lived  with  them,  and  his partner did  not work  outside  their
home.  He  supported  them  financially, as well  as his  daughter  from  his second  marriage.
Because  he  was responsible  for all  of  the  debt  from his  last  relationship,  he  was only  able
to  tread  water financially. Applicant’s middle  daughter was born during  this period, further
straining   their   finances.  In   2017,  when   the   Army   told  him   that  he   was  going   to   deploy
again,  this time  to  Afghanistan, Applicant  chose  to  leave  the  ARNG. He was unemployed
for  a   9-month   period   from   August  2017   to   April  2018.  When   he   regained   part-time
employment in April 2018, he  earned  only  $10 an hour until August 2018.  (Tr.  28-30, 90-
91)
Prior to his unemployment, Applicant earned approximately $60,000 annually as
dual-status technician. His civilian job with the DOA was tied to his service in the ARNG.
When he left the ARNG, he also lost his job with the DOA. Prior to leaving the ARNG and
DOA,  Applicant  filed  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  protection  in  August  2016.  He  made
payments according to the scheduled payment plan until 2018, when he was no longer
able to make the full payments due to his lack of income. (GE 1 – GE 5; Tr. 30-31, 74-82)
All three of Applicant’s biological children are disabled in some capacity, as is his
stepdaughter, who receives Social Security  benefits. Due  to their children’s disabilities,
his partner is unable to work outside of their home. (Tr. 99-100, 113, 115)
The mortgage debt  alleged  in SOR ¶ 1.a, for Applicant’s former  home, became
delinquent in 2014, when he stopped making payments following his second divorce. He
resided in the home for approximately 4 years without making payments; however, the
mortgage  was  included  in  his  2016  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  plan.  The  home  was
foreclosed upon in 2018, and sold in 2019. Multiple credit reports in the record reflect that
the current balance is $0. Applicant had no additional tax obligations related to this debt.
(See Chart)
Applicant’s  child-support  obligations  for  his  oldest  daughter  became  delinquent
during the period when he and his wife were separated in 2013, prior to the finalization of
their divorce, and when he was unemployed for nine months in 2017 and 2018. The debt
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c reflects the arrears that accumulated during the period that he was
unable to pay. Since regaining employment, Applicant has been making his court-ordered
payments  plus  $100  monthly  arrearage  payments.  These  payments  are  automatically
deducted from his paychecks. (See Chart)
Applicant’s  federal  student  loans,  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  (past  due  $587,  total
balance  of  $10,349);  1.f;  and  1.h  (past  due  $281,  total  balance  of  $4,968);  totaling,
$21,641, became delinquent between 2015 and 2016 for the above-stated reasons. His
most recent credit reports indicate that he has one $25,804 consolidated federal student
loan that is in good standing and was opened in January 2020. He made two automatic
monthly payments of $165 toward this loan prior to the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid,
Relief,  and  Economic Security (CARES) Act  in  March  2020.  Applicant  testified that  he
paid and resolved the student loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f in 2020, but his documentation
does  not  clearly  support  his  assertions;  regardless,  his  student  loans  are  in  good
standing,  and  as  discussed  below,  he  has  the  means  to  make  payments  toward  his
consolidated student loan when the CARES Act expires. (See Chart)
In  March  2021,  Applicant  contacted  the  creditor  for  SOR  ¶  1.k.  He  originally
opened this credit card  in 2007, and  it became delinquent  in  2014;  however,  when  he
contacted the creditor, it had no record of his account or his social security number. He
has not used this account in over ten years. He has the means to pay this debt, but due
to a lack of information was unable to make a payment. (See Chart)
When Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in August 2016, he was
earning $60,000 annually. He made 16 monthly payments of $152, per the payment plan.
After 16 payments, the monthly payment amount increased to $366. However, at the time
that  the  monthly  payments  increased,  he  was  unemployed.  He  continued  to  make
payments of $152 for three or four months, until the bankruptcy was dismissed in April
2018. He paid a total of approximately $3,000 to the trustees of the bankruptcy. Applicant
could not afford to refile for bankruptcy after it was dismissed. (See Chart)

In  September  2018,  Applicant  was  able  to  find  a  job  in  State  A,  which  is
approximately  two  thousand  miles  away  from  where  he  was  living  at  the  time.  He
borrowed  money  from  his  partner’s  parents  to  drive  himself  across  the  country.  After
repaying  his  partner’s  parents,  he  saved  approximately  $10,000  in  emergency  funds;
however, he was also supporting two households while working in State A, which limited
his ability to repay his delinquent debts. (Tr. 91-97)
Although Applicant earned $94,000 annually at his position in State A, he left after
only a few months due to the high cost of  living in the area. He then took a job in the
Midwest, where the cost of living was significantly lower.  His partner and their children
moved to live with him, further reducing their expenses. He worked for this employer for
two years, and earned approximately $104,000 annually. (Tr. 91-97)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  Government  investigator  in  January  2019,  and
confronted with his delinquent debts. He acknowledged that he wanted to pay and resolve
his  debts  but  did  not  have  the  capability  at  that  time  to  pay  them.  In  August  2020,
Applicant started working for his current employer, a Defense contractor, and at the time
of  the  hearing,  he  was  earning  $200,000  annually.  In  2020,  after he  started  earning a
higher salary, Applicant started making payments toward his delinquent debts using the
“snowball  method”  to  resolve  his  smallest  debts  first.  He  paid  and  resolved  debts  that
were not alleged in the SOR. (GE 5; Tr. 32-34, 91-97)
Based upon the  recommendation  of  his counsel, Applicant used his emergency
savings to resolve several of the SOR allegations in March and April 2021, shortly before
the hearing. Prior to this recommendation, Applicant had relied upon his understanding
that the statute of limitations (SOL) for delinquent debts in his former state of residence
was  three  years;  therefore,  many  of  the  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  were  no  longer
enforceable.  At  the  time  of  the  hearing,  after  paying  his  delinquent  debts,  he  had
approximately $60,000 in combined savings, checking, and investment accounts. (GE 8;
AE A; AE O; AE N; Tr. 85, 106-109)
Applicant timely filed his state and federal income tax returns shortly before the
hearing and owed approximately $200 and $1,000, respectively, and had the resources
and intent to pay both entities. He received credit counseling through his bankruptcy, did
research online, listened to the advice of one of his non-commissioned officers (NCO),
and read and followed Dave Ramsey’s materials. He utilizes a written budget to track his
bills and expenses. He has almost $7,000 of disposable monthly income, $5,000 of which
he routinely saves. His most recent credit reports indicate no new delinquent debts, and
all of his previous delinquent debts became delinquent during his divorce or during his
period of unemployment and underemployment. (GE 4; GE 8; AE A; AE O; AE N; Tr. 85,
106-109)
Applicant provided copies of his NCO evaluation reports between 2010 and 2016.
He was consistently described as knowledgeable, prepared, a team player, and a leader.
His  record  included  the  following  awards  and  decorations  while  serving  in  the  ARNG:
Army Achievement Medal (second award); Army Good Conduct Medal; and NCO of the
Quarter. Applicant was also recommended for an Army Commendation Medal for work
that  he  performed  in  support  of  Operation  Enduring  Freedom  while  he  was  serving  in
Kuwait. He wants to continue to serve the United States. (AE P, AE Q; Tr. 116-117)
