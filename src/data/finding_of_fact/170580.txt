Applicant  is  a  29-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  eligibility  for  access  to
classified  information for  his  job  as a Linux system  administrator for a  company in the
defense industry. He has been so employed since  April 2018, and this is the first time
he has applied for a security clearance. He had a full-time job as a system administrator
for a different company during 2014-2018. Before that, he had a part-time job as a web
developer  via  a  work-study  program  during  2012-2014.  He  was  a  university  student
during 2010-2016, and he  was awarded a  bachelor’s degree  in  2016. He is single with
no children although he is engaged to be married in 2022.
The  SOR  alleges  a  history  of  financial  problems  consisting  of  eight  delinquent
student-loan  accounts  in  amounts  ranging  from  $2,718  to  $46,335  for  a  total  of  about
$86,948.  The  three  accounts  with  Navient  are  alleged  to  be  charged  off  while  the  five
accounts  with  the  Department  of  Education  are  alleged  to  be  in  collection.  Although
Applicant  formally  denied  the  allegations  in his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  does  not  deny
obtaining the loans but instead takes issue with the status of the various  accounts. As
alleged  in  the  July  2020  SOR,  the  eight  delinquent  student  loans  are  established  by
credit reports from July 2018 and October 2019. (Exhibits 4 and 3, respectively)
A  more  recent  credit  report,  offered  by  Department  Counsel,  from  July  2021
shows  an  improving  situation.  (Exhibit  2)  The  report  shows  ten  student  loans  with  the
Department  of  Education/Nelnet  (which  is  a  federal  student  loan  servicer  working  on
behalf of the Department of Education) are in good standing. (Exhibit 2 at 1-4) The ten
accounts have balances in amounts ranging from $1,332 to $4,446 for a total of about
$27,876; none the accounts are past due; the status for all accounts is paid as agreed;
and the date of last payment for all accounts is June 2021, the month before the credit
reported was obtained.
The  three  charged-off  student  loans  with  Navient  are  included  in  the  July  2021
report too. (Exhibit 2 at 5-6) The largest was charged off in the amount of $41,590 and
had a current balance of $44,853. The last payment on the account was made in March
2021. The second was charged off in the amount of $14,983 and had a current balance
of $15,483. The last payment on the account was made in March 2021. The third was
charged  off  in  the  amount  of  $5,519  and  had  a  current  balance  of  $0,  as  it  is  a  paid
charged-off account. The last payment on the account was made in November 2020. In
summary,  the  July  2021  credit  report  shows  Applicant  had  a  total  balance  of  about
$60,336 on two accounts with Navient and the third account was paid.
Note,  the  July 2021  credit  report also  shows  two  student  loans  with  Sally  Mae,
both are being paid as agreed, and both are joint accounts (with Applicant’s parents as
far as I can determine). Likewise, Applicant Exhibit I pertains to the two Sally Mae loans,
which are not alleged in the SOR or at issue in this case.
Applicant provided more up to date information at the hearing via a January 2022
credit  report.  (Exhibits  A  and  B)  The  credit  report  shows  all  his  accounts  are  in  good
standing as follows: (1) a reported balance of $4,544 for four credit-card accounts, three
of which have $0 balances; (2) a reported balance of $0 for no collection accounts; (3) a
reported  balance  of $52,030 for 12 student loans  (the two  Salle  Mae  loans, which  are
not  at  issue,  and  10  loans  with  the  Department  of  Education/Nelnet;  the  latter  total
about $27,876; (4) a reported balance of $0 for auto loans; and (5) a reported balance
of  $356,059  for  a  mortgage  loan  for  a  recent  purchase  of  a  home.  The  three  student
loans with Navient are not reflected in this credit report, and they may have aged off. All
ten student loans with the Department of Education/Nelnet are in good standing as are
the two Salle Mae loans.
In  addition  to  the  credit  report,  Applicant  presented  a  January  18,  2022  letter
from the Department of Education concerning his student loans. (Exhibit C) The letter is
verification that his loans were transferred to a new loan servicer (likely Nelnet) due to
Applicant’s  rehabilitation  of  the  loans.  The  letter  also  informed  Applicant  that  the
Department of Education had notified the national credit bureaus to delete the record of
default from his credit record, and that he was eligible for all the benefits associated with
the rehabilitated loans before default.
In his post-hearing documentation, Applicant presented proof of payment on the
three  charged-off  student  loans  with  Navient.  (Exhibit  H)  It  shows  Applicant  made  11
payments during 2020 for an account ending in  5368, which  resulted  in  paying off  the
charged-off account mentioned above. He made 10 payments during 2020-2021 for an
account  ending  in  1574.  And  he  made  10  payments  during  2020-2021  for an  account
ending in 9508. Altogether, the payment history shows Applicant paid a total of $8,735,
with  $5,214  applied  to  principal,  $3,268  applied  to  interest,  and  $252  applied  to  fees.
The  outstanding  balance  on  the  two  unpaid  charged-off  loans  is  $62,751,  which  is
consistent  with  the  $60,336  balance  reflected  in  the  July 2021  credit  report  discussed
above.  Note,  the  Navient  account  numbers  in  Exhibit  H  appear  to  match  the  Navient
account numbers in the credit reports from 2018, 2019, and 2021. (Exhibits 4, 3, and 2,
respectively)
In addition to the student loans, Applicant presented documentation showing his
overall financial  responsibility.  Recalling the  January 2022  credit  report,  it  shows  all of
Applicant’s  financial  accounts  are  in  good  standing  and  that  he  has  no  collection
accounts  or  public  records.  (Exhibits  A  and  B)  Applicant  qualified  for  and  obtained  a
mortgage loan to purchase his first home in December 2020. (Exhibit D) The mortgage
loan  was  for $363,298  to  purchase  a  $370,000  home  with  a  monthly  loan  payment  of
$2,116. (Exhibits B and D) He owns a car, but he wisely bought a used 2017 Honda for
cash for less than $15,000, plus sales tax and fees, in December 2020. (Exhibit G)
Applicant has a good income and has shown an ability to increase his earnings.
His  2018  W2  shows  he  earned  $58,285  in  wages;  his  2019  W2  shows  $89,120  in
wages;  and  his  2020  W2  shows  $89,329  in  wages.  (Exhibit  E)  Recent  leave  and
earnings  statements  show  he  earned  a  gross  income  of  about  $101,241  in  2021.

Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3  The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4

‘right’  to a security  clearance”); Duane v. Department  of Defense, 275 F.3d  988,  994 (10th  Cir. 2002)  (no
right to a security clearance).

4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.6
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability   to   live   within  one’s  means,  satisfy   debts,   and   meet
financial  obligations  may   indicate   poor  self-control,  lack  of   judgment,   or
unwillingness  to   abide   by   rules   and   regulations,   all   of  which  can   raise
questions  about  an   individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and   ability   to
protect classified  or sensitive  information. . ..
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying
conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶  19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and
AG ¶ 19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  or difficulties  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.
The disqualifying conditions noted above apply.
5  ISCR Case No.  02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).
6  Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶¶  E3.1.14  and E3.1.15
Applicant  has  mitigated  the  security  concern  stemming  from  his  history  of
delinquent  student  loans  under  AG  ¶  20(d).  As  found  in  the  findings  of  fact,  the  five
federal student loan accounts in collection were successfully rehabilitated and are now
in good standing. (Exhibits 2, A, B, and C) Concerning the three charged-off  accounts
with  Navient,  one  account  was  repaid  and  the  other  two  accounts  are  in  repayment.
(Exhibits  2  and  H)  Together,  this  shows  Applicant  is  no  longer  neglecting  his  student
loans and is taking the matter seriously. There is also ample evidence to show Applicant
is  conducting  his  financial  affairs  responsibly.  The  most  recent  credit  report  from
January  2022  shows  all  his  accounts  are  in  good  standing  and  he  has  no  collection
accounts or public records. (Exhibits A and B). His finances were of sufficient quality to
allow  him  to  qualify  for  a  mortgage  loan  of  more  than  $350,000  to  purchase  his  first
home  in  late  2020.  (Exhibit  D)  He  demonstrated  common  sense  and  good  judgment
when  he  bought  a  used  2017  Honda  for  cash  as  opposed  to  financing  an  expensive
new  automobile  with  a  huge  monthly  loan  payment.  (Exhibit  G)  He  is  earning  a  good
income  and  it  appears  he  has  sufficient  cash  flow  to  meet  his  financial  obligations.
(Exhibits  E  and  F)  Although  he  did  not  present  a  perfect  case  in  mitigation,  Applicant
has  made  a  measurable  good-faith  effort  to  resolve  his  delinquent  student  loan
accounts per AG ¶ 20(d).
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent  standard,  I  have  no  doubts  or
concerns  about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to
protect  classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the
evidence  as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the
unfavorable  evidence  or  vice  versa.  I  also  considered  the  whole-person  concept.  I
conclude  that  he  has  met  his  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  show  that  it  is  clearly
consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  him  eligibility  for  access  to  classified
information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:
For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.h:
For Applicant
Conclusion
It  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for
access to classified information. National security eligibility is granted.
