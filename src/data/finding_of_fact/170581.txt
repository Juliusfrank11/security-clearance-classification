Applicant is a 51-year-old software developer who recently started working at his
present place of employment. He earns approximately $160,000 a year. He is a well-rated
employee and a highly respected worker. (Exs. I-J). Applicant takes the responsibilities
related to his work and his security clearance, which he has maintained without incident
for 23 years, very seriously. (Tr. 21) Applicant is nearing completion of an undergraduate
degree in political science. He is married. He has a teenage child who excels as a gifted
student.
Applicant  has  received  financial  counseling  and  retained  a  qualified  tax
professional to handle both his future tax returns and related matters. (Tr. 15, 29-30) He
believes he now possesses “financial literacy.” (Tr. 30) At issue are:
-  Applicant’s  failure  to  timely  file  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for  tax
years 2012-2018 (SOR allegations a-b);
-  Applicant’s failure to  pay  delinquent  federal taxes for tax  years 2013, 2014,  and
2015  ($13,120) and delinquent state taxes for tax years 2013, 2015,  and 2016
($5,972)  (SOR allegations c-d); and
-  Applicant’s  responsibility  for  the  balance  owed  on  a  charged  off  account
($40,100) (SOR allegation e).
Attributing his tax issues and delinquent debt to a lapse in judgment and poor inter-
spousal communication, Applicant noted his failings on his March 2019 eQIP and during
an April 2019 interview, indicating that he was working on rectifying the situation. (Tr. 20,
27,  58-59;  Exs.  1-2)  Having  maintained  a  security  clearance  for  23  years,  he  knew
financial  responsibility  and  honoring  his  tax  obligations  were  required.  He  already  had
begun addressing his “mistake” by December 2018. (Tr. 60) He noted, “[I]t was a lapse
of judgment. I should’ve filed and I didn’t file.” (Tr. 25) Applicant consulted a lawyer, then
retained a professional tax preparer to help him get his tax issues in order. Ultimately, he
did not recoup refunds owed to him that were unrecoverable because they “were out of
statutes of limitations. In satisfying all tax sums owed for the tax years at issue, however,
he thought the situation “would balance itself out. . . .” (Tr. 25)
The  SOR was issued  on  June  29,  2020.  Applicant’s federal tax  returns for  tax  years
2012-2015  were  accepted  by  the  appropriate  tax  authorities  by  late  February  and  early
March 2020. (Exs. B-C, K;  Tr.  26, 33) He  also  filed  his  tax  year 2016  federal  return, with
a  refund  issued  in  April 2020; federal tax  returns for tax  years 2017  and 2018  resulted  in
refunds  in March 2020. (Ex. B; Tr. 26) Any  owed  federal taxes have  been  paid.  (Tr. 37-
38; Ex. B, Ex. K)
Applicant has completed  and submitted state tax returns  for tax years 2017-2018,
with   refunds  issued   by   mid-March  2020.  (Ex.   C;  Tr. 31-32) State   tax   returns  for 2014-
2015  also  were accepted, but  their  processing  was delayed  due  to  Covid.  The  return for
tax   year 2014   was   received   in  March  2020. (Ex.  E) While   the   date   of  filing   is unclear,
Applicant paid state  taxes for tax  year 2015  in  April 2020. (Ex. E, Ex. C)  As of  at least
August 12, 2021, Applicant’s state  reflected  his prior payment of taxes owed  for tax  years
2012,  2013,  2015, and  2016  (Ex. D,  Ex. K; Tr.  33)  Consequently, all  state  tax  sums  at
issue have been paid.  (Tr. 39; Exs. C-E)
By  February  2019,  Applicant  had  discovered  that  a  home  equity  loan  for  about
$40,100 might go into default because he had somehow been paying less than the full
monthly amount owed, as well as miscommunications with his wife, he asserted claims
against  the  lender.  (Tr.  44;  Ex.  2  at  6) The mounting problems  with  this account  were
discussed during his April 2019 interview. (Ex. 2) The loan was ultimately defaulted and
turned over to a law firm. Applicant worked with the law firm  and agreed to initially pay
$1,200 a month toward the loan balance. (Tr. 41) The law firm eventually reduced to $869
and instituted a settlement agreement indicating the settlement amount due was $31,300.
This settlement agreement was signed in mid-June 2020, and scheduled to end
by the end of May 2023. (Ex. F) After 16 timely payments, some or more exceeding the
$869 a month agreed upon, the sum had been reduced to about $17,153 by September
2021. (Tr. 43; Ex. G) Applicant has continued to make timely payments toward the goal
of satisfying the obligation. (Tr. 43)
Today, Applicant and his wife now work in concert to make sure all financial issues
are in order. He drives a 12-year-old car, which he bought used and for which he since
has paid in full. (Tr. 74) His wife also drives a used car. Applicant maintains a retirement
savings account. He has not been on vacation in years. No longer relying on a commercial
tax preparation computer program, he now relies on his new professional tax preparer.
Applicant’s family lives within their means. Applicant’s home has significantly increased
in value in the past few years. He is up to date with his federal and state tax return filings.
