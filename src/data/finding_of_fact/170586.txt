Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance.  The  admitted  allegations  are  incorporated  and  adopted  as  relevant  and
material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant  married  his  former  coworker  in  October  2021  following  a  dating
relationship that began in 2020. (AE E; Tr. 103, 129) He has one child (a son, age 18)
from  a  prior  relationship,  who  resides  with  his  mother.  (GE  1;  Tr.  136-138)  While
Applicant has not seen his son in 10 years (Tr. 137), he has stayed in contact with him
and  continues  to  provide  financial  support  to  him.  (Tr.  141)  Applicant  averred  that  his
son enlisted in the Marine Corps following his high school graduation. (Tr. 138)
Applicant earned his high school diploma in June 2003 and has earned several
certifications  in  the  IT  field  since  graduating  from  high  school.  (GE  1;  Tr.  73)  He
attended  college  classes,  beginning  in  September  2019,  and  recently  earned  a
bachelor’s  degree  in  network  security  (Tr.  104)  Applicant  enlisted  in  the  Army  in
September  2003  and  served  one  month  of  active  duty  before  being  discharged  under
the Army’s early separation guidelines. (GE 1; Tr. 104)
Since  September 2015, Applicant has been  employed  by  his current  employer as
a  senior system  administrator and  more recently  as a  cloud  compliance  lead.  (GE  1;  Tr.
73)  For   the   past   eight  years,  he   has   been   involved   professionally   in  the   information
technology   (IT)  field.  Between   June   2005   and   September  2015,  Applicant  worked   for
other non-defense  employers in various jobs. (GE 1)
Applicant’s alcohol consumption and arrest-history
Applicant  was  introduced  to  alcohol  at  the  age  15  (mostly  beer).  (GE  2)
Alcoholism  runs  in  his  family.  (Tr.  109)  From  ages  18  to  22,  he  regularly  consumed
alcohol socially (mostly mixed drinks) and often drank to a level of intoxication in social
situations with co-workers and friends on weekends. (Tr. 111)
Between September 2011 and November 2018, Applicant was involved in three-
alcohol-related incidents. (GEs 2-7 and AEs A-D; Tr. 75-102) In September 2011, after
hanging out and drinking with a friend at a party, he was stopped by police for a cited
inoperable license plate. (GE. 2) After administering a field sobriety test of Applicant, the
officer  arrested  Applicant  and  charged  him  with  DUI,  DUI  per  se,  and  driving  while
impaired  by  alcohol.  Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to  DUI  per  se  and  received  probation.
(GEs  1-2  and  7)  His  probation  conditions  included  a  requirement  that  he  complete  an
alcohol substance abuse class. (GE 7)
Following  his  2011  DUI  incident,  Applicant  ceased  drinking  for  approximately
three  years  before  resuming  his  consumption,  mostly  in  social  situations.  (GE  2  and
AEs A and D) In February 2017, Applicant had consumed alcohol socially with friends to
the  point  of  intoxication  before  driving  home  (Tr.  114).  While  driving  at  a  high  rate  of
speed, he  was stopped  by a  police  officer who  noticed  Applicant’s tires were spinning.
(GE  6)  Noting  a  strong  smell  of  alcohol  on  Applicant’s  breath,  in  addition  to  glassy,
bloodshot  eyes,  the  officer  administered  standard  field  sobriety  tests  on  Applicant.
Citing  Applicant’s  test  failures,  the  officer  administered  a  preliminary  breath  test.  Test
results  produced  a  blood  alcohol content  (BAC) percentage  of  .14 per cent.  Based on
these  test  results,  the  officer  arrested  and  charged  Applicant  with  DUI,  DUI  per  se,
driving  while  impaired  by  alcohol,  and  driving  while  so  far  impaired  by  alcohol  that  he
could not drive safely. (GE 5)
Appearing in court on his 2017 DUI charges, Applicant pleaded guilty to DUI per
se  and  was  sentenced  to,  inter alia,  four days  of  confinement,  and  payment  of  a  fine.
(GE  4). Following  his DUI  incident,  Applicant  abstained from  alcohol  for a  year  before
resuming his alcohol consumption in 2018. (GEs 2 and 5)
In   November   2018,   Applicant   was  arrested   and   charged   with   DUI  and   other
alcohol-related   charges  after  being   questioned   at  the   scene   of   an   accident  involving
Applicant.  (GEs 2-4  and  AEs A  and  D). Before  leaving  a  restaurant for home, Applicant
consumed three beers and two martinis with friends without feeling intoxicated. (Tr. 126-
129) Arrest  reports  confirm  that Applicant declined  to  take  a  sobriety  test at the  scene
and   was  arrested   and   charged   with   four  related   counts   of  DUI.  (Tr.  126-127)  At  the
request  of  arresting   police   at   the   scene,   Applicant  was  escorted   home   by   a   neighbor.
(GE 4)  In  court, Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to  DUI in January  2019  and  was sentenced  to,
inter alia, two  years of confinement (all  but 90  days suspended), mandatory  outpatient
alcohol treatment,  and  probation through  August 2021. (GEs 1-4  and AEs A and D)
In compliance with his 2018 DUI treatment requirements, Applicant enrolled in an
outpatient alcohol counseling and treatment program in January 2019. (AE A) While his
treatment  counselors did  not  diagnose  him  with  any  form  of  alcohol  disorder,  they  did
recommend his enrollment in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), and abstain from drinking for
the duration of  the program.  (AE A; Tr.130) The program ran for 26  weeks over a  six-
month  period  (2019-2021),  during  which  time  Applicant  abstained  from  all  alcoholic
beverages.  (AE  A;  Tr.130)  Applicant  successfully  completed  his  26-week  alcohol
treatment  program  in  September  2019.  (AE  A).  His  program  counselors  credited  him
with consistent attendance and active, significant, and introspective group participation.
(AE A)
During  his  2019  counseling  and  treatment  program,  he  was  administered  three
random drug screens, all of which returned negative results in every drug classification
(including alcohol). To reinforce his lifestyle changes and the need for total abstinence,
his program counselors recommended weekly support meetings for a minimum of three
months  following  his  discharge.  (AE  A)  Applicant  accepted  and  complied  with  the
program’s abstinence recommendations and weekly support meetings and was credited
with successfully completing the program in September 2019. (AE E; Tr. 145-146)
Following   his  enrollment   in  his  26-week  outpatient   program   in   January   2019,
Applicant essentially  abstained from  alcohol. While he  was not recommended  to  abstain
from   alcohol  entirely   by   the   substance   abuse   counselor  he   consulted   with   in  a   post-
discharge   counseling  session   in September 2021,  she   did   enter   a  10-point  score from
the   Michigan   Alcohol   Screening   Test  (MAST)  she   administered   to   Applicant   in  her
counseling  session  with  him.  His counselor was able to  neutralize  this high  point  score
by   characterizing   it  as   a   reflection   of  his   past  DUI  incidents  that  did  not   necessarily
correlate  with  the  abstinence  he  practiced  since  his  las  DUI incident  in 2018.  (AE  D;  Tr.
148)   Crediting   Applicant   with   over  two   years  of  sustained   abstinence,   his   counselor
assigned   a   positive   prognosis  to   Applicant’s  ability   to   keep   his  alcohol  consumption
under control. (AE D)
Since  his  2018  DUI  incident,  Applicant  he  has  consumed  alcohol  on  only  two
occasions: once in  January 2019 and  once in a toast at his wedding  in October 2021.
(Tr. 30-36, 129-130) He has attended AA meetings regularly between January 2019 and
August 2021, and with the support of his spouse and support groups (inclusive of  AA),
he has maintained his sobriety (save for the two cited exceptions). (AEs A and D-E; Tr.
130-131)
Further,  since  his  last  DUI  incident  in  2018,  Applicant  has  not  been  involved  in
any  alcohol-related  incidents  or  abused  alcohol  in  any  way.  Corroborating  his
abstinence  assurances  are  negative  screen  results  from  three  non-randomized  drug
and alcohol screens conducted in August and September 2021, respectively. (AE C)
Endorsements and awards
Applicant  is  well-regarded  by  his  supervisors  (past  and  present),  family,  and
friends  who  know  him  (both  at  work  and  socially),  and  are  aware  of  his  prior  DUI
incidents.  (Tr. 22-25) AEs  B  and  G;  Tr. 45-46)  None  of  his  references  have  seen  him
intoxicated, either at work or in non-work situations. (Tr. 32-70) Uniformly, they credited

his  work  responsibilities.  (Tr.  22-31,  44-49)  Applicant  is  credited  with  receiving
promotions in recognition of his exceptional contributions and demonstrated strong work
ethic.  (Tr.  45-48)  All  of  Applicant’s  supervisors,  spouse,  and  colleagues,  past  and
present,  believe  that  Applicant  possesses  the  level  of  honesty,  trustworthiness,
reliability, and judgment requisite for holding a position of trust.
