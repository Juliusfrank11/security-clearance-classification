Applicant admitted both allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 45  years old.  She  has been married  since  2006 and  has  two  children
who  are 16  and  14  years old.  She  earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in 1998  and  a  master’s
degree  in 2014. She  is a  prospective  employee  for a  federal contractor. (Transcript (Tr.)

The  SOR  alleges  two  student  loans  debts  (¶¶  1.a-$45,694  and  1.b-$119,570).
Applicant  testified  that  she  attended  an  out-of-state  college  from  1994  to  1998.  Her
parents took out loans to pay some of her college expenses, and she took out student
loans in her own name. She was not certain of the exact amount of her original loans, but
estimated  the  total  was  likely  $60,000.  Applicant  took  college  courses  from  a  private
college from 1999 to 2002, while working full time. Her undergraduate student loans were
deferred during this time. She used student loans to fund her graduate education and she
estimated the amount of those loans to be around $60,000. She did not earn a degree
from this school. (Tr. 25; GE 2, 3)
Applicant  testified  that  when  she  left  school in  2002  she  was  supposed  to  start
repaying her student loans. She said she paid $100 a month until about 2006 when she
married. She said sometime after 2006 the owner of the loan changed, and she did not
know who to pay. She testified that at some point, she began paying again. It is unclear
when  the  loans  became  delinquent  again.  She  did  not  provide  any  documents  to
corroborate her testimony. (Tr. 25, 30-32)
Applicant began attending online college classes through a private university from
2011 to 2014. She testified that her student loans were deferred during this period. She
also  was  able  to  get  a  small  loan  of  about  $3,000,  through  the  GI  Bill,  because  her
husband was on active duty in the military. She  received  her master’s degree in 2014.
She contacted the creditor and learned she owed a lot more than she thought. She has
not made any payments on any of her student loans since graduating in 2014. (Tr. 14-15,
25-26, 32-33)
In 2013, Applicant founded a non-profit organization. She had a detailed business
plan, but it technically did not launch until about 2015. She voluntarily left her job in 2015
to run the non-profit. She had a partner. Applicant invested a small amount of her own
money  into  the  business,  but  the  bulk of  the  operating and funding  was  to  come from
government grants. She anticipated it would be three years before she was earning an
income. She estimated  that both her and her partner would  each earn about $90,000.
From 2015 to 2016, Applicant was not earning any income. The business account has a
current  balance  of  about  $7,000  to  $8,000.  When  asked  how  she  intended  to  make
student loan payments during the three years she did not anticipate earning an income,
she said she had not factored that expense into her planning. (Tr. 19-24, 33-37)
Applicant went back to  work in December 2016. She  changed  jobs in  the  later part
of  2019  and  was then  laid off  in March  or May  2020  due  to  the  pandemic. She  was earning
about  $24,000   annually   in  her  new   position.   She   was  unable  to   make   student  loan
payments. He  wages were garnished  by  the  Department  of  Education.  She  contacted  the
creditor and  was advised  that  she  could apply  for an  income  based  repayment plan.  By
the  time  she  received  the  application  form, the  pandemic had  begun  and  student loans
were put in  a  deferred  status.  She  has  not contacted  the  creditor  since  the  loans were
deferred. She  hopes to  participate  in a  payment plan  after the  deferment ends. (Tr. 17-
19, 24, 37-42)
Applicant did not recall making any voluntary payments on her student loans since
2011. Applicant has no idea how she will repay her student loans. She has no savings.
Her  family’s  annual  income  is  about  $65,000.  She  is  conscientious  in  how  her  family
spends their money. She credibly testified that when she was 18 years old she wanted to
attend a certain school and did not consider how expensive it was. When she graduated,
she was shocked at how much the monthly amount was to repay her student loans. Then
she attended another college that was also expensive, but again did not think about the
financial impact.  She  thought with  a  master’s degree  her earning potential would allow
her to repay the loans because she would earn more money. By the time she realized the
financial impact, she was between 35 and 40 years old and had about $160,000 of student
loan debt. She attempted to get a better paying job with a federal contractor, but is having
difficulty meeting its qualifications. She is hoping if she can get a better paying job, she
can pay her student loans. (Tr. 41-47)
