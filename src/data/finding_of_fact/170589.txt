Applicant is a 31-year-old single woman. She graduated from college in 2011 and
has been working as a healthcare consultant for various companies since then. (Item 1 at
5; Item 3 at 5)
Since finishing college in 2011, Applicant has incurred approximately $50,000 of
delinquent  debts.  Subparagraph  1.a,  totaling  $185,  is  a  delinquent  health  club  fee.
Applicant satisfied it on May 4, 2021. (Item 1 at 11) Subparagraph 1.b, totaling $623, is a
delinquent car insurance payment. (Item 1 at 6) The delinquent amount is the balance due
when she switched car insurance carriers in September 2019. She switched car insurance
providers because she could no longer afford the rate after losing her job in 2019. (Item 3
at 9) On May 4, 2021, Applicant contacted the creditor and arranged a payment plan. She
paid her first installment, totaling $124, that day. (Item 1 at 13)
Subparagraphs  1.e  through  1.g  are  allegedly  delinquent  student  loans,  totaling
approximately $32,000. Subject originally borrowed $18,000 to $20,000. (Item 3 at 8) She
deferred paying these loans for three years. (Item 3 at 8) She was unaware that interest
would accrue while the loans were in deferral. In May 2021, Applicant retained a credit
repair company to  help  her set  up  a  payment  plan.  (Item  1 at 7, 24) She provided no
evidence of any payments made yet.
SOR  subparagraph  1.h  alleges  that  Applicant  failed  to  file her state income tax
return for 2018. Applicant performed seasonal work in this state, but did not live there.
(Item 1 at 7) Moreover, she never received a W-2 or W-4  form  from  the  state’s taxing
authority, as her employer failed to withhold income taxes from her salary. (Item 1 at 5) In
early 2021, the state garnished her wages. Since then, she has been paying $250 per pay
period.  (Item  1  at  29)  The  initial  balance  was  approximately  $6,000,  as  alleged  in
subparagraph 1.i. Currently, the balance is $2,000. (Item 1 at 7)
Applicant did not file  her federal income  tax  returns for tax  years 2017  and  2018  on
time, as alleged  in subparagraph  1.j. (Item  1  at 7) Moreover, as of  the  date  of  the  SOR,
Applicant owed  back federal income  taxes  totaling  $3,889  for 2014  (subparagraph  1.k),
$8,554  for 2015  (subparagraph  1.l), and  $13,193  for tax  year 2016  (subparagraph  1.m).  In
April  2021,  Applicant  paid  $1,500   towards  her federal income   tax   deficiency.  The   IRS
applied  the  payment to  tax  years 2014  through  2016  in  equal,  $500  amounts.  (Item  1  at  32-
36)  On  August 3, 2021, Applicant retained  a  company  that assists people with  resolving
income tax  delinquencies. (Response to FORM at 3)
In September 2020, Applicant began working with her current employer. (Response
at 1) This is the first job with consistent, full-time hours that she has had since finishing
college. Previously, all of her work was either temporary or seasonal, and her income was
sporadic. Between 2014 and 2018, she only worked 40 percent of the year, and between
2018 and Fall of 2019, she was unemployed. (Item 1 at 5, Item 3 at 5)
In January 2018, Applicant went on a tropical vacation out of the country.  She took
another vacation out of the country in January 2019. (Item 2 at 19-20)
Section  26  of  the  EQIP  requests applicants to  disclose  whether they  have  had  any
accounts or credit cards turned  over to  a  collection  agency, suspended, charged  off, or
cancelled  for failing  to  pay  as agreed.  (Item  2  at 27)  SOR subparagraph 2.a alleges that
Applicant falsified  this section  because  she  did not list the  debts alleged  in subparagraphs
1.a   through   1.d.  When   Applicant  completed   the   SOR,  she   was  aware  that  both
subparagraphs 1.a  and  1.b were delinquent, but did not know that they had been turned
over to collection agencies. (Item 1 at 8-9)
Section  26  of  the  EQIP  also  requires  applicants  to  disclose  current  federal
delinquencies, whether they have ever been delinquent on federal or state delinquencies in
the past seven years, or whether they have failed to file any federal or state income tax
return. (Item 2 at 27) Applicant did not include her delinquent federal student loans, as
required. During her subject interview, she admitted taking out several student loans in
2012 and being subsequently unable to satisfy them because of employment instability.
(Item 3 at 7) In her answer, she stated that they were “not factual debts.” (Item 1 at 9)
Applicant did not include her state income tax delinquencies on her EQIP. At the
beginning of Applicant’s subject interview, she volunteered that she had not paid state
taxes  for  2017  and  2018.  (Item  3  at  7)  She  did  not  mention  her  federal  income  tax
delinquency. She contends that she did not include the federal tax delinquencies because
she was unaware they had been turned over to a collection agency. (Item 1 at 9)
