Applicant denied all the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  30-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor for “about  six-and-a-half  years.” (TR at  page  12
lines 2~5, and GX 1 at page 7.)  He is single and has no children. (TR at page 13 lines
14~22.)  Applicant  attributes  the  alleged  past-due  indebtedness  to  a  period  of
unemployment  or  underemployment  “between  2013  to  2015.”  (TR  at  page  22  lines
16~19.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a.  and  1.b. Applicant has past-due debts totaling about $10,027 to Creditor A,
as the result of motor vehicle repossession. He has done little if anything to address this
past-due  debt,  which  appears  on  his  July 2021  credit  report.  (TR at  page  24  line  2  to
page 29 line 10, at page 36 line 15 to page 37 line 24, at page 38 line 11 to page 39 line
9, and GX 4 at page 6.) These allegations are found against Applicant.
1.c.~1.h.  Applicant  had  past-due  student  loan  debts  totaling  about  $32,607  to
Creditor  C.  Applicant  has  resolved  these  debts  by  way  of  garnishment;  and  as  such,
they are  no longer  reflected as  past-due  on the  Government’s  July 2021  credit  report.
(TR  at  page  29  line  11  to  page  34  line  24,  GX  4  and  AppX  B.) These  allegations  are
found for Applicant.
Guideline E - Personal Conduct
2.a.  Applicant  knew  or  should  have  known  of  his  past-due  indebtedness,  noted
above  under  Financial  Considerations,  when  he  executed  his  September  2019
Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). He answered, “No,” to
Section 26 as to his having financial delinquencies “in the past sever (7) years.” (TR at
page 14 line 11 to page 24 line 1, and GX 1 at pages 32~33.)  I find this to be a willful
falsification. This allegation is found against Applicant.
