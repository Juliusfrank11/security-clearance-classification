In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  1.e  –  1.l,  1.n,  and  1.o.
Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  1.d,  and  1.m.  He  also  provided  brief  narrative
explanations for some of  the SOR  allegations,  and  a  longer narrative  statement about
his  financial  problems.  In  his  FORM  Response,  Applicant  provided  an  additional
narrative  statement  addressing  Department  Counsel’s  arguments.  Applicant’s
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 64 years old. He has been employed by a defense contractor since
2009. His work during this timeframe has been in a combat zone. He was employed as
a government employee from 2000 – 2006. He served on active duty in the U.S. military
from 1975 until he retired in 1998. He has no reported periods of unemployment. He last
applied for a security clearance in 2009. He earned an  associate’s  degree in 1984. He
has been married since 2015, and has a daughter age 37. (Item 2)
The SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts, totaling approximately $83,000. Twelve of
the debts are charged off, and three are in a collection. The allegations are established
by  Applicant’s  admissions,  and  the  2019  and  2021  credit  reports.  Applicant  did  not
provide  any  documentation  of  the  current  status  of  the  SOR  debts.  (Items  1,  2,  4,  5)
The status of the debts follows:
SOR  ¶  1.a  is an auto  loan  that  was  charged  off  in  the amount  of  $11,840.  The
account was opened in 2015, with a date of last activity in August 2019. Applicant states
that he was a cosigner on the loan for his step son. After a “falling out” with his mother,
the  step  son  left  the  car  with  Applicant,  who  then  turned  it  in  to  the  lender  before  he
returned to work overseas. (Items 1, 4, 5)
SOR  ¶  1.b  is  a  credit  card  that  was  charged  off  in  the  amount  of  $4,411.  The
account was opened in 2015, and the  date of last activity was in January 2018. (Items
1, 4)
SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.d  are  medical  accounts  in  collection  for  $121  and  $107.
Applicant  claims  these  debts  were  paid,  but  did  not  provide  any  supporting
documentation. The debts are noted on his 2019 credit report, but the creditors are not
identified. (Items 1, 4)
SOR ¶ 1.e is a loan that was charged off in the amount of $3,782. The account
was opened in 2017, and the date of last activity was in August 2019. Applicant claimed

supporting documentation. (Items 1, 4)
SOR ¶ 1.f is an insurance account that was placed for collection in the amount of
$276. In his Answer, Applicant claimed that he would pay the debt in the next 30 days,
but did not provide any supporting documentation that it had been paid. (Items 1, 4)

account  was  opened  in  2008,  and  the  date  of  last  activity  was  August  2019.  In  his
Answer, Applicant claimed that this is the next big item that he will work on as soon as
he  can  make  arrangements  with  the  current  credit  holder.  He  did  not  provide  any
supporting documentation to show that he took any subsequent action. (Items 1, 4, 5)
SOR ¶ 1.m is an auto loan that was charged off in the amount of $16,115.  The
account  was  opened  in  2016,  and  the  date  of  last  activity  was  September  2019.
Applicant claimed the full amount has been paid off, but did not provide any supporting
documentation. (Items 1, 4)
SOR  ¶  1.n  is  a  credit  card  that  was  charged  off  in  the  amount  of  $3,455.  The
account was opened in 2015, and the date of last activity was March 2017. (Item 4)
SOR  ¶  1.o  is  a  car  that  was  repossessed,  and  the  loan  was  charged  off  in  the
amount of $8,924. The account as opened in 2015, and the date of last activity was July
2018. Applicant stated in his Answer that he turned the car into the lender because he
was deploying to work overseas. He provided no subsequent information of his efforts
to address the remaining balance owed. (Items 1, 4)
Applicant  asserted  in  his  Answer  and  his  FORM  Response  that  his  financial
difficulties were  caused  by circumstances beyond his control. In 2017, his wife  started
treatment for a medical condition,  which  was  not  covered by insurance. In June 2018,
his salary was reduced by $25,000 when his contract was assumed by a new employer.
He also lost $30,000 in income in 2020 due to the pandemic. (Item 1, FORM Response)
Applicant  also  asserts  that  his  finances  were  significantly  impacted  during  this
period  due  to  erroneous  reports  to  the  credit  bureaus  and  to  his  bank,  that  he  was
deceased. He asserts that this occurred both in mid-2017 and again in 2018. Applicant
said he was not aware of this at the time. The situation impacted his finances when his
military  retirement  pay  and  VA  disability  pay  were  stopped  in  2018,  for  about  four
months. His creditors also demanded full payment. He stated that he did not have  the
money to pay them in full, and they went unpaid while  he figured out what to do next.
(Item 1, FORM Response)
Applicant  claims  he  called  several  debt  relief  services,  and  was  advised  to
address  his  debts  one  at  a  time.  He  stated  that  once  he  confirms  the  identity  of  each
creditor, he plans to address his debts in this manner. He cited  his payment of SOR ¶
1.m,  as  an  example,  but  this  payment  is  not  documented.  Applicant  provided  no
documentation  of  payments  made  towards  any  of  his  SOR  debts,  any  payment
agreements established, or formal relationships with any debt relief service. (Items 1, 4)
Applicant stated that his financial problems were an isolated incident. He argued
that his debts were not excessive, and but for his loss of income he could have paid his
creditors.  He  claims  that  these  financial  problems  haven’t  happened  before  or  since,
and that he made a choice to pay his wife’s medical treatments over his bills. He states
that  during his many years of  government  service,  he  has  never considered  betraying
his country.  He  argues  that  his financial  situation was  beyond his control, and  that his
debt has been dealt with or is being dealt with. He asserts that the credit reports being
used by the government are from 2017 and 2018, when his accounts were frozen. (Item
1, FORM Response)
While some of Applicant’s  debts became delinquent after mid-2018, a  review of
credit reports in the record indicate that the date of  last activity for several SOR debts
(SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.n, for instance) are from early 2017 – before Applicant’s
initial drop in income and before the first erroneous reports of his death. (Items 4, 5)
A  review  of  Applicant’s  credit reports list only  two  accounts  referencing  Applicant
as deceased  (Items  4,  5, listing  SOR ¶  1.n  and  the  creditor for SOR 1.o,  but a  different
account).   Applicant  also  provided   a   one-page   credit   statement   from   zumper.com
indicating  that he did  not have  a  credit score because  he  was deceased.  (Items 4, 5, AE
A)
Applicant did not provide any documentation showing that any of his debts have
been  paid,  are  being  paid,  or  have  been  disputed.  He  also  failed  to  provide
documentation  concerning  his  current  financial  situation,  such  as  his  monthly  income
and expenses, his assets, or whether he follows a budget. He provided no evidence of
credit counseling.
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (EO)  10865,  Safeguarding
