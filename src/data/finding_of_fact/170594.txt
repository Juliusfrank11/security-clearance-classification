In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  admitted  in  part  and  denied  in  part  the  SOR
allegations.  (HE  3)  He  also  provided  extenuating  and  mitigating  information.  (Id.)  His
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 38-year-old lead weapons instructor, who has worked for a defense
contractor  since  May  2020.  (Tr.  26-27;  GE  1;  AE  A)  He  is  applying  to  be  a  special
operations technician for which he will need a security clearance. (Tr. 69) If employed in
this  position,  his work  will  be  similar to  his Army  duties  when  he  was  in  Army  Special
Forces (SF). (Tr. 70) He received praise for his contributions to his Defense employer.
(HE 3 at 4; AE A) He has not had any employment problems after leaving confinement in
October 2016. (Tr. 70)
In  2006,  Applicant  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  political  science  and  an
additional bachelor’s degree in law and justice. (Tr. 25; HE 3 at 2) As part of his college
experience, he volunteered in legal aid and was an advocate for people who were the
victims  of  domestic  violence.  (Tr.  25-26;  HE  3)  He  assisted  in  the  preparation  and
publication  of  a  legal  study  while  in  college.  (Tr.  26;  HE  3)  He  is  currently  deployed
overseas working for a Defense contractor at a base. (Tr. 24, 27)
Applicant served on active duty in the Army from April 2007 to October 2016, and
he  received  an  honorable  discharge.  (Tr.  28,  44;  AE  E)  He  volunteered  for,  and  was
selected  to  attend,  SF  training.  (Tr.  29-30;  HE  3  at  2)  He  successfully  completed  SF
training in January 2009 and was awarded the Green Beret. (Tr. 30; HE 3 at 2; AE D) He
is Ranger, High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) parachute, and diver qualified. (Tr. 30-31;
HE 3 at 2; AE D) He completed several additional specialty training courses. (Tr. 31; AE
D)
Applicant was deployed to Pakistan for five months in 2011 and to Afghanistan for
10  months  from  2013  to  2014.  (Tr.  32-33;  HE  3  at  3;  AE  D)  He  served  his  country  in
combat and went on exceptionally dangerous capture or kill missions. (Tr. 32-33; AE C)
He had friends who were killed or injured in combat. (Tr. 33) He was a multi-purpose K9
handler, which included searching for improvised explosive devices (IED), other enemy
munitions, and enemy weapons. (Tr. 34) More information about his military background
is included in the Character Evidence section, infra.
Applicant’s  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  disability  rating  is  90  percent,
which includes disability for damage to various joints, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and 50
percent for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). (Tr. 57-59, 142) He had service-related
injuries to his hand and foot. (HE 3 at 3) He is seeking an increase in his disability rating
to 100 percent. (Tr. 142)
Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct
Alleged Theft, Importation, and Possession of Army and Foreign Munitions
The allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b are cross-alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a. SOR ¶ 1.a
alleges that Applicant was charged with the following criminal offenses: disobedience of
a lawful general order, in violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ);
failure  to  provide  notice  and  turn  over  abandoned  property,  in  violation  of  Article  103,
UCMJ;  possession  of  unregistered  firearms  and  explosives,  in  violation  of  Article  134,
UCMJ; and larceny, in violation of Article 121, UCMJ. In January 2016, he was sentenced
at a BCD-SPCM to be confined for 12 months and to reduction to specialist (E-4).
The conduct that formed the basis for the charges began during Applicant’s most
recent tour in Afghanistan in 2014. For about three months while Applicant was deployed
to  Afghanistan, he  gathered munitions.  (Tr. 139-140) Munitions are  defined  as military
equipment, which includes firearms, ammunitions, and explosives. He did not describe
how he obtained the munitions and whether he falsified any inventory, disposition, or turn-
in  documents.  During  this  deployment,  he  said  he  told  an  SF  colonel  about  having
munitions and  wanting  to  bring  the  ordnance  back to  the  United  States to  use  for training
of   K9   teams.  (Tr.   41,  95-97)   He   said  he   wanted   munitions  that  were  similar  to   enemy
munitions encountered  in Afghanistan  for more  realistic training. (HE  3  at  6, 11) The  SF
colonel told  him  it would involve  too  much  paperwork, hassle,  or effort to  obtain approval.
(Tr. 41-43, 97) The  SF colonel did not specifically  say  no  to  Applicant’s suggestion  about
importation  of  explosives from  Afghanistan  into  the  United  States. (Tr. 98) Applicant  did
not provide  the  name  or contact information  for the  SF colonel. Applicant denied  that he
received  a  direct order not to  bring  the  ordnance  to  the  United  States. (Tr. 43) He decided
to  “improvise” to  accomplish  this self-identified  training  mission. (Tr. 42) He rationalized
that he  could not accept no for an  answer when  he might be  able to  save  lives by  taking
the  actions   that he  took.  (Tr. 42)  No  one   ever gave   him   permission   to   bring   munitions
from  Afghanistan  to  the  United  States.  (Tr. 83)  The  only  enemy  munitions identified  were
two  PG-7VM, which are  fired from a  rocket propelled  grenade  (RPG)-7  launcher, and  an
AK-47.  See   The   Specification   of   Charge   II,  and   the   Specification   of   Charge   IV,   infra.
However, it is likely  that the  enemy  in Afghanistan  uses stolen  U.S. munitions and  PG-
7VMs for IEDs and other nefarious purposes.
Applicant  put  the  munitions  he  gathered  in  Afghanistan  in  an  ISU-60  Army
container  along  with  K9  and  other  tactical  equipment.  (Tr.  88,  140)  The  ISU-60  was
transported from Applicant’s tactical location, to Bagram Air Base, and eventually to  an
Army canine facility in an installation in the United States. (Tr. 140-141) He did not indicate
he warned the shipping entities (aircraft or ship), the Army, or customs that he had stored
explosives or munitions in the container.
Applicant  gathered  more  than  2,000  rounds  of  5.56  millimeter  ammunition  in
Afghanistan  to  bring  to  the  United  States.  (Tr.  89)  He  brought  the  ammunition  to  the
United States in ammunition cans in the ISU-60. (Tr. 89, 140-141) He said that there was
too  much  “red  tape  and  bureaucracy” in getting  ammunition  on  the  military installation,
and  he  believed  he  could  improve  the  survivability  of  his  team  by  avoiding  the
bureaucracy in training involved in getting ammunition authorizations. (Tr. 91-92) He said
that in 2014 he was focused on saving lives through realistic training. (Tr. 91-94) He did
not provide any statements from anyone that 5.56 millimeter ammunition was unavailable
for SF training at the installation where he was assigned.
Ammunition  is  accountable  in  the  United  States  at  U.S.  Army  ranges.  (Tr.  116)
Soldiers are not permitted to retain unused ammunition when leaving the range. (Tr. 116)
Overseas unused ammunition is supposed to be transferred to the replacement unit when
a unit rotates back to the United States. (Tr. 116) There was no information presented
that  the  unit  that  replaced  Applicant’s  unit  suffered  any  mission  decrement  due  to  the
missing munitions that Applicant took and exported to the United States from Afghanistan.
In November 2014, Applicant returned to the United States from Afghanistan, and
he brought some live ordnance or munitions from overseas  into the United States. (Tr.
37-38,  83)  He  wanted  to  train  dogs  with  actual  munitions  because  he  believed  that
devices used for training in the United States had a different odor. (Tr. 38) He suggested
use  of  ordnance  from  Afghanistan  in  K9  training  would  reduce  or  eliminate  in-country
acclimation  of  the  dogs.  (Tr. 38)  He  brought  explosives  and  ammunition  to  the  United
States to  enhance  a  canine  team’s survivability. (Tr. 38) However, some  of  the  items he
brought were souvenirs that he  took to  remind  him  of  an  operation  or mission. (Tr. 38) He
said he  had  U.S. and  enemy  ordnance  at his house  to  use  for training  because  dogs need
to  recognize  the  difference  between  friendly  and  enemy  munitions.  (Tr.  39) He  said  he
planned  to  take  the  ordnance  to  his  base  for training. (Tr. 40) He denied  that the  ordnance
was for his own  personal use  or gain.  (Tr. 41)  Whatever he  did not use  for  training, he
intended  to  “organize  a  big  cache  and  then  blow  it in place” on  the  military  installation.
(Tr. 95)  He never said he  intended  to  return the  U.S. Army  military  property  he imported
from  Afghanistan  into the United States to Army official supply channels.
Applicant  transported  the  munitions  that  he  obtained  in  Afghanistan  from  the
military installation to his off-post residence in his privately-owned vehicle. (Tr. 84-85) He
never  moved  the  munitions  from  his  off-post  residence.  (Tr.  85)  He  never  used  the
munitions for training. (Tr. 85) The munitions were stored in unlocked boxes in his off-
post residence; however, they were in a room with a locked door. (Tr. 86)  There is no
evidence that he attempted to sell the munitions to others.
In  late  November 2014  while  Applicant was on  leave  away  from his home,  there
was  a   break-in  of  his   off-post   residence.   (Tr.  139;  HE  3   at  6)  The   burglar  left  a   door
partially  open, and  a  neighbor called  the  police. (Tr. 139) The  law  enforcement officials
who   entered   his  off-post  residence   informed   the   Army   of  the   ordnance   in   Applicant’s
residence. Some  of Applicant’s personal firearms were stolen  in  the  burglary; however,
he  said none  of  the  munitions  that he  brought from  Afghanistan  were stolen. (Tr. 138-
139)
In July 2015, the following four charges and four specifications were referred to a
BCD-SPCM.  On  October  16,  2015,  Applicant  and  his  counsel  submitted  a  pretrial
agreement in which they offered to plead guilty to the Specifications of Charges I, II, and
IV,  and  Charges  I,  II,  and  IV,  in  return  for  referral  to  a  BCD-SPCM,  to  accept  the
amendments to other charges and specifications, and to dismiss the larceny of military
property charge. (GE 4 at 17-19) The offer to plead guilty included a promise to complete
a stipulation of the facts supporting the guilty plea. The parties did not provide a stipulation
of fact for inclusion in the security clearance record. (Tr. 142) The convening authority
accepted the offer to plead guilty.
In  the  Specification  of  Charge  I,  and  Charge  I,  Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to
wrongfully possessing and exporting one AN-M14 incendiary hand grenade; two M18A1
Claymore  Antipersonnel  Mines;  four  blocks  of  C4  Demolition  Charges;  17  M81  Igniter
Time Blasting Fuses; five M67 fragmentary hand grenades; eight rounds of 40 millimeter
low  velocity  High  Explosive  Dual  Purpose  (HEDP);  detonation  cord;  three  thermobaric
grenades;  six  blasting  caps;  M15  Modernized  Demolition  Initiators  (MDI);  M11
Modernized  Demolition  Initiators;  one  Dual  In-Line  initiator  blasting  cap;  and  C3
demolition charge datasheet. In addition to these items of U.S. military ordnance, he was
also charged with items of non-U.S. military property, including an AK-47 assault rifle and
one  British  fragmentation  grenade.  (GE  4  at  9-10,  12,  17).  The  maximum  possible
confinement for a violation of Article 92, UCMJ includes years of confinement. See MCM,
2012 ed., ¶ 16e(1)). Applicant agreed that the items in the Specification of Charge I above
were in his off-post  residence  and  most were U.S. Army  property. (Tr. 87-88) He did not
have  authority  from  any  military  authority  to  have  this property  in his residence. (Tr. 88)
While  he   was  deployed   to   Afghanistan,   Applicant  was  entrusted   with   his  SF   team’s
property. (Tr. 135; HE 3 at 3)
Applicant pleaded guilty to the Specification of Charge II, and Charge II, failure to
report and turn over captured or abandoned property, to wit: an AK-47 assault rifle, two
PG-7VM,  one  RPG  launcher,  of  a  value  greater  than  $500,  in  violation  of  Article  103,
UCMJ  (maximum  sentence  includes five  years of  confinement,  see MCM,  2012  ed.,  ¶
27e(1)(b));
The Specification of Charge III and Charge III were referred to trial; however, they
were dismissed pursuant to a pretrial agreement. They allege larceny of military property
of  a  value  of  more  than  $500,  in  violation  of  Article  121,  UCMJ  (maximum  sentence
includes  10  years  of  confinement,  see  MCM,  2012  ed.,  ¶  46e(1)(c)).  Applicant  was
charged with stealing the following items of U.S. Army military property from Bagram Base
in Afghanistan on or about October 2014: 2,088 rounds of 5.56 millimeter ammunition;
491  rounds  of  7.62  millimeter  long  range  ammunition;  263  rounds  of  9  millimeter
ammunition; one AN-M14 incendiary hand grenade; two M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel
Mines; four blocks of C4 Demolition Charges; 23 M81 Igniter Time Blasting Fuses; five
M67  fragmentary  hand  grenades;  eight  rounds  of  40  millimeter  low  velocity  High
Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP); 18 demolition blocks of ¼ lb. Trinitrotoluene charges;
detonation  cord;  three  thermobaric  grenades;  six  blasting  caps;  M15  Modernized
Demolition
Initiators;  one  M142
Multipurpose  Firing  Device;  one  Dual  In-Line  initiator  blasting  cap;  and  C3  demolition
charge datasheet. (GE 4 at 9, 14) He said he was not guilty of the larceny offense. (Tr.
43).
Initiators  (MDI);  M11  Modernized  Demolition
Applicant pleaded guilty to the Specification of Charge IV and Charge IV, wrongful
possession of unlawful firearms,  to wit: an AK-47 assault rifle, two PG-7VMs, and one
rocket  propelled  grenade  launcher,  in  violation  of  Article  134,  UCMJ  and  26  U.S.C.  §
5861(d)  (Section  5861(d)  states,  “it  shall  be  unlawful  for  any  person--(d)  to  receive  or
possess a firearm which is not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and
Transfer Record”). (GE 4 at 9-10; HE 3 at 7)
Applicant providently pleaded guilty in accordance with his pretrial agreement; the
larceny  charge  was  dismissed;  a  military  judge  sentenced  him  to  12  months  of
confinement; and with good behavior, he served almost 10 months of confinement. (Tr.
45; HE 3 at 7) Applicant’s father died while he was in confinement. (Tr. 44) Applicant said
he  took  responsibility  for  and  pleaded  guilty  to  the  offenses  he  committed.  (Tr.  77)
Applicant believed his offenses were not felonies. (Tr. 144-145)
Applicant disclosed the criminal offenses on his March 15, 2018 SCA. He admitted
that he made the wrong choices in his manner of handling munitions, and he said he had
no excuses or justifications for his actions. (Tr. 92-93) He promised to be detail oriented
and strictly follow protocols and rules in the future. (Tr. 64, 92) He would not place the
mission at such a  high priority  that he  would circumvent rules and  laws in the future.  (Tr.
65) He promised that he would not have any transgressions in the  future. (Tr. 67)
Applicant inherited or purchased several rifles and guns. (Tr. 99) He denied that
he was a collector of firearms or ammunition. (Tr. 100, 132) For example, he purchased
a Walter P38 Nazi relic, a World War II Luger pistol, and a Valmet fold stock 5.56, which
is an AK-style rifle. (Tr. 100-101) He currently owns seven to ten firearms. (Tr. 136) In
2017, he spent about $12,000 to purchase two firearms. (Tr. 136) He is currently storing
the firearms he purchased. (Tr. 136) He purchased these items as investments. (Tr. 101)
None of the firearms he currently owns fires a 5.56 milliliter round; however, in November
2014, he owned an AR-15, which fires a 5.56 milliliter round. (Tr. 137) The AR-15 was
stolen in the burglary of his residence in November 2014. (Tr. 137)
Alleged Theft of Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) and Family Separation
Allowance
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  that  in  January  2015,  Applicant  was  referred  for  disciplinary
action for violation of Article 121, UCMJ, for receiving Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH)
at the with dependent rate for failing to update his records to indicate he was divorced in
2012.  There  was  probable  cause  to  believe  he  fraudulently  submitted  a  document  for
family separation  allowance  (FSA)  for his deployment  in  2014.  He  did not  receive  any
disciplinary action because of his pending court-martial as indicated in SOR ¶ 1.a.
Applicant was married  from 2007  to  January  2012. (Tr. 35,  103) He  believed  his
wife  was upset with  him  because he  dedicated  his life  to being  a  successful Soldier. (Tr.
36) His wife  wanted  to  be  his  top  priority, and  he  advised  her that he  was giving  his career
and   the   Army   top   priority.  (Tr.  36)   Applicant   believed   his  decision   to   give   such   a   high
priority to Army SF caused or contributed to  the end of his marriage. (Tr. 35-36)
Applicant  said  he  provided  his  divorce  decree  to  the  Defense  Finance  and
Accounting  Service  (DFAS),  and  he  completed  the  documentation  to  change  his  BAH
after his divorce from with dependent to single; however, DFAS continued to pay him BAH
at the married or with dependent rate. (Tr. 46, 130; HE 3 at 9) He contacted DFAS three
or four times in the next two months after his divorce, and he asked DFAS to stop paying
him at the with dependents rate. (Tr. 46, 102) He was focused on being a good Soldier
and  completion  of  his SF  missions,  and  he  concluded  DFAS  would  eventually  correct
their mistake. (Tr. 47, 131) The local DFAS office was notorious for being understaffed
and inefficient. (Tr. 47) There is no evidence that he asked his chain of command or the
Inspector General for assistance in getting DFAS to correct his BAH payments. He was
not  confronted  with  the  overpayment  until  he  returned  from  Afghanistan  in  November
2014. (Tr. 132) He did not provide copies of any correspondence sent to DFAS to correct
the BAH overpayment.
Applicant received a BAH overpayment of about $15,000. (Tr. 127) He paid the
overpaid funds back to DFAS in the beginning of 2015. (Tr. 48, 104, 126-127)
In  late  2014, the  Army  Criminal Investigation  Command  and  other law  enforcement
presented  to  Applicant a  DD  Form  1561, which  was allegedly  signed  by  Applicant  on April
18, 2014,  to  apply  for family  separation  allowance  (FSA), which is an  allowance  paid when
a Soldier is separated  from their spouse and/or children while deployed. (HE 3 at 10; AE
J) The  DD  Form 1561  indicates his deployment began  on April 4,  2014,  and he  was “not
divorced   or  legally   separated   from   [his]  spouse.”  (AE   J)   On   May   12,   2014,   a   logistics
branch   lieutenant  colonel,  commanding,  signed   the   DD   Form   1561   (not  an   SF
commander). (AE  J) Applicant said  he  was re-deployed  to  Afghanistan  in April 2014. (Tr.
48)  He denied  that he  filled  out or signed  the  DD  Form  1561, and  he  noted  his first name
was  not  spelled   correctly   on   the   DD   Form   1561.  (Tr. 50-51, 128;   HE  3   at  10)   He  was
never  charged   with   submitting   a   fraudulent  DD   Form   1561   or  BAH  fraud.  (Tr.   52)   He
denied that he  had ever stolen  from  his country. (Tr. 66)
An SF colonel and a former SF soldier described multiple problems with the same
DFAS office that was supposed to process Applicant’s BAH and FSA. (Tr. 109, 113-114,
121-122) The DFAS office may have had difficulties because of the SF operational tempo
and various special pays for SF soldiers. (Tr. 109-111)
Applicant has good credit. (Tr. 53-55) A friend offered him employment at three to
four times his Army pay, and he decided to stay on active duty because he wanted to
deploy with his SF team. (Tr. 55-57, 122-123)
Character Evidence
An  SF  colonel,  who  is  currently  a  battalion  commander,  attended  the  SF
qualifications course with Applicant in 2008, and they subsequently served together in the
same detachment. (Tr. 107, 113) He was aware of Applicant’s court-martial; however, he
still believed that at his core, Applicant had good character. (Tr. 112) A friend described
Applicant as a patriot who wanted to continue to contribute to the Department of Defense.
(Tr.  124)  Numerous  written  character  statements  laud  his  contributions  to  mission
accomplishment while serving as an SF Soldier and Defense contractor. (AE A; AE B)
The general sense of Applicant’s character statements is that he is  patriotic, dedicated,
reliable,  diligent,  brave,  loyal,  friendly,  and  professional.  (AE  A;  AE  B)  Applicant  is
engaged in several charity endeavors. (HE 3 at 5)
In  2014,  Applicant  and  his  team  were  involved  in  a  firefight  in  Afghanistan.
Applicant repeatedly moved through enemy fire, and in the engagement, he  entered a
building and killed three enemy combatants. His actions saved the lives of two Afghan
Soldiers  who  were  medically  evacuated  and  other  team  members  through  his
suppressive  fire  upon  enemy  positions.  He  provided  a  “Narrative  to  Accompany  the
Award” and “Citation to Accompany the Award” for a Bronze Star with V device. (AE C)
However,  he  did  not  provide  the  orders for  the  award  or the  recommendations  for  the
award, which are usually detailed on a DD Form 638.
Applicant  initially  said  he  was  awarded  two  Bronze  Stars,  and  an  Army
Commendation Medal (ARCOM) with V device. (Tr. 34-35; AE D) Then he said, “I had a
Bronze  Star  with  valor.  That  was  talked  about  being  upgraded  to  a  Silver  Star.  I  had
another ARCOM with valor that same trip.” (Tr. 35)  He reiterated that he had an “Army
Commendation Medal and the Bronze Star with Valor.” (Tr. 35)
Applicant’s DD Form 214 shows that he received the following Army awards and
badges: two Bronze Star Medals (BSM); one Army Commendation Medal (ARCOM) with
V Device; two Army Good Conduct Medals (AGCM); one National Defense Service Medal
(NDSM); one Global War on Terrorism Service Medal (GWTSM); two Noncommissioned
Officer Professional Development Ribbons (NCOPDR); one Army Service Ribbon (ASR);
one  NATO  Medal;  Combat  Infantryman  Badge  (CIB);  SF  Tab;  Ranger  Tab;  Military
Freefall  Parachutist  Badge;  Parachutist  Badge;  Special  Operations  Diver  Badge;  and
Expert Marksmanship Badge with Carbine. (AE D) He successfully completed numerous
training courses. (Id.) The narrative and citation Applicant submitted do not establish with
certainty that he was awarded a Bronze Star with V device. His DD Form 214 listing of
medals, awards, and badges is given greater weight  than the narrative and citation he
submitted and his claims that he received a Bronze Star with V device. See AE D.
Applicant  believes  he  has  changed  since  November  2014,  and  is  now  a  better
person.  (Tr.  143)  The  “darkness  and  death”  of  his  combat  experiences  temporarily
clouded his judgment. (Tr. 143) He loves the United States, and he promised to serve
honorably  in  the  future.  (Tr.  143)  With  a  security  clearance,  he  can  increase  his
contributions to the national defense. (Tr. 143)
