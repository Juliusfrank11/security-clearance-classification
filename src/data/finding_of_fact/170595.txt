Applicant  denied  all  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  38  years  old.  He  married  in  2003  and  divorced  in  2009.  He  has  an
adult  child  from  the  marriage.  He  remarried  in  2015  and  has  no  children  from  the
marriage. (Transcript (Tr.) 18-20; GE 1
In September 2019, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA).
He disclosed he worked full time as a 1099 subcontractor from 2012 to 2018 for a federal
employer. He also said he worked full time for his own business, Company Y. He clarified
this  in  his  testimony.  During  2019  he  worked  part  time  for  this  employer,  but  also  was
working for his own business, Company Y. He testified that he started Company Y as a
private business in 2011, but it did not become viable and profitable until about 2018 when
he  began  receiving  federal  contracts.  He  continued  for  a  period  to  work  as  a
subcontractor, but at some point after 2018, he worked full time for his business. He is
now  a  full-time  employee  and  owner  of  Company  Y.  He  said  from  2018  to  2020  his
company hired employees (3) and was not earning a lot of money. Applicant’s wife is a
co-owner of the company with 51% of the share. His 2021 income was at least $155,000
and likely a bit more, but he did not know the exact amount. His wife’s income from the
business  was  $135,000.  He  was  unsure  of  his  earnings  in  2020  and  2019.  He  said  in
2017 he earned about $60,000 as a subcontractor. He provided a copy of his 2018 IRS
1040 showing  his  income  before  taxes  was  approximately  $31,352.  He  did  not provide
IRS 1040s for previous or subsequent years. (Tr. 20-26, 52-54; GE 1; AE H)
The SOR alleges Applicant is indebted to the Department of Education (DOE) for
10  collection  accounts  for  student  loans  totaling  approximately  $39,252.  These  loans
were  obtained  from  2012  to  2014.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-$5,776;  1.b-$5,050;  1.c-$4,717;  1.d-
$4,518; 1.o-$5,624; 1.p-$4,397; 1.q-$2,626; 1.r-$2,626; 1.s-$1,315; and 1.t-$2,603). (Tr.
82; GE 1 through 8)
The SOR also alleges Applicant is indebted to another student loan creditor, XYZ
and  has  eight  collection  accounts  totaling  approximately  $20,204.  These  loans  were
obtained from 2003 to 2006. (SOR ¶¶ 1.e-$3,808; 1.f-$3,513; 1.g-$2,636; 1.h-$2,620; 1.i-
$2,230; 1.j-$1,959; 1.k-$1,755 and 1.l-$1,683). (GE 1 through 8)
In  Applicant’s  September  2009  SCA,  he  disclosed  he  graduated  high  school  in
2001. He attended college from 2001 to 2004, but did not earn a degree. He attended a
vocational school from July 2007 to November 2008 and earned a master’s license. He
stated that he had four classes to complete to earn his Associate’s in Arts degree, which
he intended on completing in the spring semester. (Tr. 18-19; GE 2)
In the financial disclosure section of his 2009 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had
defaulted on a loan in July 2009 to his state’s student-loan authority. He stated:
I took our student loans during [c]ollege to pay for my tuition and books and
after leaving college I was unable to pay back the loan. I have made large
sum  payments  over  the  years,  but  defaulted  about  a  year  ago.  I  made
payment arrangements with them 6 months ago and am in the process of
paying the full loan amount back with [interest]. I never intended to default
on this loan but I was just making ends meet and couldn’t afford to make
the monthly payment. I am now in a financial positon to repay the loan.
A  September  2009  credit  report  (GE  7)  reflects  eight  delinquent  student  loans
obtained from 2003 to 2006 for a total of approximately $19,472. The last payments made
were in October 2008 and September 2009. Applicant testified that he made lump sum
payments towards the loans, but could not afford to repay them. He explained the lump
sum payments were his income tax refunds that were withheld by the IRS and applied to
his  student  loan  debt.  He  believed  this  happened  in  2017,  2018  and  2019,  but  was
uncertain.  These  amounts  decreased  his  balance,  but  did  not  satisfy  it.  He  said  these
amounts would have been sufficient to cover his monthly payments. (Tr. 57-64; GE 7)
Applicant testified that there were periods of time between 2006 and 2018 that he
was  enrolled  in  college  and  the  loans  would  have  been  deferred.  In  September  2019,
Applicant  completed  another  SCA  for  reinvestigation.  In  it  he  disclosed  he  has  been
attending  college  from  2011  to  the  present.  Applicant  provided  a  narrative  in  a  post-
hearing document with an explanation and a copy of his academic student transcript. (AE
D, E) He explained it showed the semesters he received credit toward an undergraduate
degree  from  2011  to  2018.  The  document  does  not  detail  what  semesters  he  was  in
school  and  when  his  loans  would  have  been  deferred  prior  to  2011,  except  as  he
previously  noted.  He  further  explained  that  from  2018  until  the  present  he  has  been
unable to earn additional credits toward a degree, but intends to start in the fall of 2022.
(Tr. 61-62, 65; GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s college transcripts reflect the following:
2011-credits transferred in the fall of 2011 from previous college. No specific prior
years’ attendance is detailed.
2012-spring term-two classes.
2013-spring term-one class.
2013-summer term-two classes.
2013-fall term-one class.
2014-spring term-two classes.
2014-fall term-two classes.
2018-fall term-one class.
In the financial disclosure section of his 2019 SCA, he disclosed he was currently
over 120 days’ delinquent to a student-loan agency. He disclosed the amount owed was
$35,000. He stated: “Unable to pay all bills and student loans while starting a business.”
(GE 1) He further stated: “Working on consolidation loan with provider to remove loans
from default status and begin repayment.” (GE 1) He listed as the date the financial issue
arose  as  January  2018  and  the  date  it  was  resolved  as  September  2019.  He  stated:
“Provided tax refunds to be applied to student loan debt yearly. Working with provider to
establish consolidation loan and remove from default status.” (Tr. 64; GE 1)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in October 2019 as part
of  his  background  investigation.  During  the  interview  he  confirmed  that  he  had  student
loans  with  DOE  and  XYZ.  He  said  he  owed  DOE  approximately  $35,895  and  he  had
inadvertently failed to disclose the debt to XYZ on SCA. He believed he owed XYZ about
$19,535.  He  was  researching  consolidating  the  loans  and  participating  in  a  loan
rehabilitation program. Applicant stated his loans were in forbearance when he attended
college in 2016, and he estimated his last loan payment was made in 2016. He believes
the DOE accounts have been in and out of collection since 2018 and the XYZ accounts
since  2017.  He  said  his  monthly  payments  were  $450,  but  was  unable  to  provide  the
investigator with details about his payments. Applicant did not provide evidence he made
the monthly  payments  of $450.  He  told the investigator  that  he intended  to consolidate
his student loans by December 2019. His testified that he did not make any payments on
these loans from 2017 to September 2020. (Tr. 83-86, 90-91; GE 3, 5)
Applicant further explained to the investigator that he started his own business in
January 2018 and experienced financial problems. He said he had to pay the business
first and then take what was left to pay himself. He was not receiving a consistent dollar
amount each paycheck. However, he was now in a better financial situation because his
business had improved, and he was willing to pay his debts. (GE 3)
Applicant  was  asked  by  the  investigator  about  a  cash  withdrawal  on  September
2018 from a bank in the amount of $16,000. Applicant explained this was to purchase a
boat for the business. Applicant testified that his business is in the maritime industry and
the boat is required. (Tr. 104-106; GE 3)
Applicant’s  credit  report  from  April  2020  reflects  his  XYZ  student  loans  were  in
default in 2015. The DOE were in default from 2017. He testified that he believed he was
in school, so the loans should have been deferred. He then explained that they likely were
in  default  in  2018-2019  because  he  was  investing  in  his  business  and  prioritized
payments to his employees. He estimated that over the years, but more in the past few
years, he invested between $75,000 and $150,000 in the business. The business began
to become profitable around 2020. His February 2021 credit report lists the DOE student
loans in collection. (Tr. 64-72, 93-96; GE 5, 7)
Applicant  was  asked  what  action  he  took  after  his  October  2019  interview  to
consolidate and pay his delinquent students loans, and he said he was researching his
options.  Applicant  provided  a copy  of  a  letter  from  the  collection  company for  his  DOE
student loans dated October 14, 2020, acknowledging his September 11, 2020 request
to rehabilitate his student loans. He included the account numbers of the DOE loans and
the current balances owed including interest and collection costs. The total amount was
$46,236. As part of the rehabilitation program, Applicant was required to pay $5 a month
for nine months. Due to the CARES Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, his loans
were placed in forbearance. When asked if he made any of the $5 monthly payments, he
said  no,  because  he  was  not  required.  He  was  told  he  would  still  get  credit  for
rehabilitating  the  loan  over  the  next  nine  months,  but  did  not  have  to  make  the  $5
payments. He provided a letter from DOE from June 1, 2021, stating that his defaulted
student  loans  were  rehabilitated  and  had  been  transferred  from  the  DOE  Default
Resolution Group, which services defaulted federal student loans to a new loan servicer.
He also provided a document to show he submitted a request for an automatic monthly
payment of $140 to be made for his DOE student loans, which was to start on January
20,  2022.  Applicant  testified  that  when  this  loan  comes  out  of  forbearance  his  monthly
payment will be based on his income. He did not know yet what the amount will be. (Tr.
31-36, 41-47; 78-79, 82, 87-89; Answer to the SOR; GE 1; AE A, B, D, G)
Applicant  provided  information  that  his  XYZ  student  loans  were  now  held  by  a
different  creditor.  He  acknowledged  and  the  document  notes  there  are  eight  loans  that
were incurred from 2003 to 2006 and totaled approximately $19,693. In September 2020,
he requested they be consolidated. The program did not require him to make any good-
faith payments. The consolidation was approved in October 2020, which took the loans
out  of default status and they are  in good  standing. His monthly payment is $131.  The
loans  are  in  forbearance  under  the  CARES  Act.  The  document  states  that  during  the
forbearance,  payment  may  still  be  made  and  one  can  opt-out  of  it  and  resume  a
repayment plan. I asked if he had made the monthly payments, and he said no because
he  is  not  required to  do  so  in  accordance  with  the  CARES  Act  during  the forbearance.
Applicant testified that he made a payment of $2,500 on January 11, 2022, even though
he was not required to do so. (Tr. 31-36, 41-42, 56, 72-82; Answer to the SOR; AE B, F)
Applicant  testified  that  the  documents  he  provided  show  his  student  loans  were
consolidated or rehabilitated and were in good standing before the date of the SOR and
therefore the SOR is inaccurate because the student loan were not in default and do not
remain delinquent. (Tr. 31-34, 73; AE A, B)
Applicant  testified  that he  has  reestablished  payment  plans  for  his student  loans
and there were plenty of times he made payments on the accounts and had periods when
they were not in default. He noted from 2006 to 2012, he made payments, but there were
also periods the loans were in default. (Tr. 111-116)
The  SOR  alleges  two  medical  collection  debts  (¶¶1.m-$355  and  1.n-$36)  that
became delinquent in 2015. Applicant testified that he was unaware of these debts until
he obtained a copy of his credit report in October 2019. He disputed the charges with his
insurance company and also on his credit report. He provided documents to show he paid
the debts in October 2020. These debts are resolved. (Tr. 35, 54-56; Answer to the SOR;
GE 5, 6)
Applicant  and  his  wife  purchased  a  home  in  March  2021  for  $820,000.  Due  to
Applicant’s  credit  rating,  the  mortgage  is  in  his  wife’s  name,  because  they  could  get  a
better  interest  rate,  but  the  deed  is  in  both  of  their  names.  Their  monthly  mortgage
payment  is  approximately $2,500.  They  made  a  cash  down  payment  of  approximately
$155,000.  Applicant  testified  that  his  share  of  the  down  payment  was  about  $75,000.
They  own  a  condo  where  they  previously  lived  and  now  rent.  The  rent  covers  the
mortgage,  but  not  beyond  that.  They  did  not  sell  it  due  to  the  market.  He  has
approximately $60,000 in a 401(k) pension plan and his wife has about $100,000. He and
his wife have about $50,000 in personal savings accounts. They purchased a new vehicle
in 2020 for $40,000. He took a loan from his pension to pay for it and then repaid the loan.
(Tr. 26-30, 102-104)
Applicant  traveled  for pleasure  in  2014  to  the  Dominican  Republic  (1-5  days),  in
2017  to  the  Bahamas  (6-10  days),  in  2018  to  Italy  (6-10  days),  and  in  2019  to  the
Bahamas (6-10 days). He also took skiing trips for three to four days to Aspen, Colorado
(2020) and Steamboat Springs, Colorado (2021). He testified that he paid his airfare for
his skiing trips to Colorado, but the rooms were complimentary. (Tr. 106-110; GE 1)
Applicant  testified  that  he  is  a  patriot  and  has  supported  defense  department
programs since  2009,  and  would not  do  anything  to  jeopardize  his  country.  He  said  he
paid  other priorities,  such  as paying  his employees.  He  admitted he should  have  taken
action on the student loans and been consistent. He said he did make payments on his
student loans over the years and they were not always in default, but did not have a record
of them. His finances have never been as good as they are now, and he does not see
any reason why he would default on the student loans again. He intends to pay them back
based on the income-based repayment plan. He has made no other recent payment other
than  the  $2,500  made  in  January  2022.  He  intends  to  pay  his  monthly  loan  payments.
(Tr. 110-111; 115-116)
Applicant provided character letters from a manager and coworker. He is described
as dedicated, hardworking, innovative, knowledgeable, and proud. He has an admirable
work ethic and a high level of accountability. He exercises good judgment and has high
moral standards. (Answer to the SOR)
