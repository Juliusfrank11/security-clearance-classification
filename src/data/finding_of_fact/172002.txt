Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  43  years  old.  He  received  an  associate’s  degree  in  2018.  He  was
married from 2009 to 2011 and in 2012. He married for the third time in 2015. He has two
adult stepchildren. (Item 2)
In  Applicant’s  October  2018  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  he  stated  in
response to his employment activities that “I have accepted an offer of employment with
[federal contractor], awaiting clearance needed.” He noted the dates as October 2018 to
present. He stated the same thing for employment activities from October 2017 to October
2018, and noted he was unemployed with a job offer and awaiting a clearance. He worked
from  February 2017  to  October  2017;  unemployed  December  2015  to  February 2017,
and was employed from June 2005 to December 2015. He left this job to go to college.
He attended college from May 2015 to May 2018. In Applicant’s answer to the SOR he
indicated he was currently employed. The dates of his employment are unknown. (Item
2)
The  SOR  alleges  four  delinquent  debts.  In  December  2018,  Applicant  was
interviewed  by  a  government  investigator.  He  was  confronted  with  the  debt  alleged  in
SOR ¶ 1.d ($28,862), which he acknowledged. The account was opened during his first
marriage. Applicant assumed payments on a trailer from the owners. He stopped making
the payments after his wife left. He did not recall the amount of the delinquency. He told
the investigator that he made payments of $50 and one of the payments was returned so
he assumed the matter was settled. In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he said that he
attempted to contact the creditor, but was unable to locate the creditor. He also said that
the debt is over 10 years old and therefore the statute of limitations has run. (Items 2,6)
During  Applicant’s background  interview Applicant acknowledged  the  delinquent
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($747) and 1.c ($114). He said he did not know that he owed
money on the accounts. He was going to research them and intended on resolving them
in 2019. Regarding the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($908), he told the investigator that he did not
know what the debt was for or if it belonged to him, but he would contact the government
investigator later to confirm the information. (item 6)
In January 2019, Applicant was interviewed again by the government investigator.
He said the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c became delinquent because he did not have the
money to pay them. He anticipated resolving the debts by the end of 2019. He said the
debt in SOR ¶ 1.a was a personal loan. He said he neglected to pay the loan because he
did not have the money. (Item 6)
Applicant’s December 2018  credit report reflects the  accounts alleged  in SOR ¶¶
1.a,   1.b.  and   1.c  as   charged   off.  The   account  in   SOR  ¶  1.d   is  listed   as  a   voluntary
surrender with a delinquent balance owed  of  $28,862. Applicant’s November 2021 credit
report does not reflect  the  alleged debts.  (Items 3, 4, 5)
In  response  to  Government  interrogatories from  January 2020,  Applicant  stated
that he attempted to resolve the SOR debts, but received no response from his inquires
and that the debts no longer appear on his credit report. (Item 3)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR he denied the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b and 1.c
and  stated  that  he  was  unable  to  confirm  their  status  with  the  creditor  and  the  three
accounts “are nearly 10 years old and therefore exceed the statute of limitations.” (Item
2)
Applicant further stated in his SOR answer that he has turned his life around. He
settled multiple outstanding debts, including five credit card debts, student loans, and a
debt for television services. He said he completed years of college and obtained a security
certificate that allowed him to obtain better job opportunities, which has allowed him to
live  within  his  means.  He  is  trusted  with  sensitive  information  and  maintains  a  clean
lifestyle.
