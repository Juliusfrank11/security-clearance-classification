Alcohol Consumption and Criminal  Conduct
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  in  March  2020,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  alcohol  use
disorder, moderate. Applicant agreed the diagnosis was accurate in March 2020. (Tr. 21)
Applicant  felt  stress  at  work  from  interactions  with  coworkers  and  due  to  extensive
mission-related  travel.  (Tr.  24-25)  He  left  defense-related  employment  in  March  2016
because his branch of the company was being sold. (Tr. 26) He had been using alcohol
to help him cope with the stresses of his employment. (Tr. 28) He made extensive efforts
to ensure his alcohol consumption did not adversely affect his employment. (Tr. 28) He
was unemployed from March 2016 to November 2017. (Tr. 27) After November 2017, he
worked  part time  for several retail  entities for  about  12  to  25  hours a  week. (Tr. 30, 34,
36)  He  also  worked   at  several  other  part-time   endeavors  unrelated   to   his  previous
defense  employment.  (Tr. 31,  35) During  2020, he  worked  for a  defense  contractor for  six
months  in  his specialty, and  then  he  was unable to  work because  the  security  levels for
his employment were increased. (Tr. 32-33)
Applicant has a family history of excessive alcohol consumption and mental health
disorders. (Tr. 37) He acknowledged a personal predisposition to these issues. (Tr. 38)
Applicant  first  consumed  alcohol  at  age  11.  (Tr.  38)  He  consumed  alcohol  in
college, and drank more regularly after college. (Tr. 38) He estimated that after college
he  consumed  about  six  beers  a  week.  (Tr.  38)  After  he  started  his  defense-related
employment and was traveling, he drank four to six beers a day. (Tr. 39)
In the 2010 to 2011 period, the volume of Applicant’s alcohol consumption peaked.
(Tr.  74)  Around  2010,  while  Applicant  was  on  mission-related  travel,  he  consumed
sufficient alcohol for an alcohol blackout. (Tr. 59-62) He did not remember how he went
from  the bar  where  he was  drinking  to  his hotel room. (Tr. 59) He believed  one of  his
Marine Corps companions at the bar drove him to his hotel. (Tr. 60) He missed the class
he was supposed to attend the next day. (Tr. 59-61)
In 2011, Applicant was consuming alcohol when he erroneously believed a bottle
in his freezer contained vodka. He consumed about six ounces of methanol that he was
storing in his freezer to use to maintain his vehicle. (Tr. 55-56) He called poison control
and  an  ambulance  took  him  to  the  emergency  room.  (Tr.  56)  He  was  hospitalized
overnight. (Tr. 57)
In 2015, Applicant was consuming alcohol and he slipped off of the couch, and cut
his toe on a knife that was on the floor. (Tr. 62) He received care at an urgent care clinic.
(Tr. 62) The incidents in 2011 and 2015 were the only alcohol-related incidents after which
he received medical care. (Tr. 63)
In 2016, Applicant consumed alcohol, and then he went to a park (Tr. 57) He fell
asleep in the park. (Tr. 58) It was cold and there was snow on the ground. (Tr. 57-58) His
alarm went off; he awoke; and he walked back to his residence. (Tr. 58) He did not suffer
frostbite or other cold-related injury.
After  he  left  his  defense-related  employment  in  2016,  he  increased  his  alcohol
consumption.  (Tr.  29)  During  a  five-month  period  in  2017,  he  occasionally  drank  500
milliliters of  alcohol (tequila  or gin)  on  more  than one  day during a week.  (Tr. 40)  The
frequency of his alcohol consumption peaked in 2017, and later in 2017, he reduced his
alcohol consumption. (Tr. 43-44, 74) In 2017, he hid bottles around his residence, and
consumed  alcohol  in  the  middle  of  the  night.  (Tr.  44)  Applicant  hid  his  alcohol
consumption from his cohabitant by consuming alcohol outside of her presence, such as
when she was at work. (Tr. 29-30) He described himself as having “extreme competency
in  being  a  functioning  drunk.”  (Tr.  30)  His  alcohol  consumption  when  off  duty  did  not
adversely affect his performance at work. In 2017, he began therapy. (Tr. 43, 45, 64) In
March 2018, he broke up with his cohabitant. (Tr. 64)
Applicant  attended  individual  therapy  and  group  counseling  from  2018  to  2020.
(Tr. 64) He attended about 15 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. (Tr. 72) His therapist
met with him on a weekly basis for 50-minute sessions which focused on treatment of his
anxiety and replacement of alcohol as a coping mechanism with more constructive means
of coping with stress. (Tr. 65-66) In late 2018, he began 105-minute weekly group therapy
sessions, and he limited his alcohol consumption to three to four beers for each drinking
session. (Tr. 45,  66) In  March 2020, he stopped meeting with  a  therapist  because  the
COVID-19  pandemic  security  protocols  for  video  teleconferencing  were  not  adequate.
(Tr. 67) His therapist did not provide a written diagnosis or prognosis. (Tr. 67) Applicant
was never explicitly told that he should abstain from alcohol consumption; however, he
acknowledged that during group sessions the message was that it was best to completely
abstain from alcohol consumption. (Tr. 68-70)
Applicant’s current level of alcohol consumption  is “almost zero.” (Tr. 46) He did
not drink any alcohol for about eight months in 2021. Then, during one three-day weekend
about one month before his hearing while visiting family, he drank nine beers. (Tr. 47, 54)
This was the most alcohol he consumed in the previous year. (Tr. 47) He acknowledge
that after consuming one drink, inhibitions are somewhat relaxed, and the next drink is
more of a possibility. (Tr. 75-76) He is confident that he is able to control the amount of
alcohol he consumes. (Tr. 71-72) He lives in a drug and alcohol free community. (Tr. 73)
On March 5, 2020, a psychologist, Dr. B, evaluated Applicant, and she diagnosed
alcohol use disorder (moderate). (GE 2 at 6) Dr. B said:
Given   [Applicant’s]  drinking   habits,  his  family   history   of   substance   abuse
and  mental health  conditions,  as well  as  [Personality  Assessment Inventory
(PAI)]  results pointing  to  significant alcohol-related  problems and  variable
mood, there  is reason  for concern. These  factors, coupled  with  his history
of   alcohol-related   incidents   and   lack  of   long   term   plans  to   abstain  from
alcohol, raise questions about his judgment.
*  *  *
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the risk of future alcohol-related incidents
seems  moderate,  and  [Applicant’s] prognosis  appears guarded. Although
[Applicant] reported that he had been consistent with individual and group
therapy, and he has gained insight into himself and his drinking, a medical
opinion  could  not  be  obtained  and  during  the  investigatory  process,  he
consistently conveyed a lack of confidence in his ability to avoid relapse in
the face of future stressors. As such, his diagnosis could pose a risk to his
judgment,  reliability  or  trustworthiness  concerning  classified  information.
(GE at 6) (emphasis added)
At the time of his March 2020 evaluation, Applicant had been sober for two months, and
he was concerned about “reversion into the past behaviors and activities.” (Tr. 50) After
his March 2020 evaluation, he ended his  alcohol-related therapies; nevertheless, he is
now comfortable with his current state of limited to almost zero alcohol use. (Tr. 50)
Applicant recognized that after receiving the March 2020 evaluation he would have
a  better  change  of  approval  of  his  access  to  classified  information  if  he  stopped
consuming alcohol. (Tr. 76-77) However, he decided to continue his alcohol consumption
because complete abstinence from alcohol as not his goal or intention. (Tr. 77) He did not
want to stop consuming alcohol because of his security clearance. (Tr. 77) He rationalized
that the reason for ending his alcohol consumption should be because of  his personal
goals and not because of security concerns related to his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 77)
Applicant  never  drives  after  consuming  alcohol.  (Tr.  51)  He  has  consumed
sufficient alcohol over the last three years to be intoxicated three or four times. (Tr.  51)
The most alcohol he consumed in the previous three years was one mixed drink and five
beers in November 2020, when his father passed away. (Tr. 48)

Applicant provided statements from four character witnesses. (AE A-AE D)
The general sense of his character statements is that he is a model employee, who
is mature, professional, empathetic, punctual, helpful, trustworthy, responsible, and
reliable. Two statements also described an improvement in his weight, health, and
general wellbeing in the last few years.
