In  his  Answer to  the  SOR, Applicant  denied all  of the  alleged  debts  (SOR ¶¶  1.a  -
1.p)  with  explanations and  some  documents.  His explanations are  incorporated  into  my
findings  of  fact.   After   a   thorough   and   careful  review   of  the   pleadings  and   exhibits
submitted, I make the  following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  41  years  old.  He  and  his  wife  separated  in  April  2015.  She  is  a
citizen and resident of a European country. He has no children. (1Tr. 36, 44; 2Tr. 34) He
earned a bachelor’s degree while in the U.S. Air Force and took some later courses but
has not earned a further degree. (1Tr. 37)
Applicant served in the Air Force from 2004-2011 as an intelligence analyst, with
a Top Secret/SCI clearance. He was discharged honorably as an E-5. (1Tr. 10, 39-41;
2Tr. 32-33; GE 1 at 24; AE S) After leaving the Air Force in December 2011, he moved
to Europe and attempted to gain employment as a U.S government contractor. (1Tr. 41)
He  worked  for  about  six  months  at  a  mall  on  a  U.S.  military  base  there  (December
2011-May  2012).  He  was  then  unemployed  for  the  rest  of  2012,  after  returning  to  the
United  States.  (GE  1  at  20)  He  worked  for  several  months  in  2012  as  a  sales
representative  for  a  cereal  company,  before  being  laid  off  in  July  2013.  He  was  then
unemployed for about two months. (GE 1 at 18-19; 1Tr. 42-43)
Applicant then worked for a defense contractor as a data analyst from September
2013 to September 2015, before he was laid off. He was then unemployed for most of
the next two years, until June 2017. (1Tr. 43-44; GE 1 at 18) From then until beginning
his current job, he worked several federal contractor jobs, interspersed with periods of
unemployment. (1Tr. 44-46; GE 1 at 15-18) His prior position, with a federal contractor,
was  under  a  six-month  contract  (Sept.  2019-February  2020),  at  the  equivalent  of
$90,000 annually. (1Tr. 37-38)
Applicant  has  worked  for his current  employer since  February 2020.  He  has  an
annual salary of $92,400.  He is a data analyst working with  veterans’  healthcare data.
(2Tr. 25, 39-40) He also receives $1,500 in veteran’s disability insurance due to a 70%
service-connected disability rating, including for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
(2Tr. 25-26, 38; AE T) Applicant is in related counseling. (2Tr. 39)
Applicant’s mother died tragically in a house fire in September 2013. He also had
difficulty  dealing  with  his  marital  separation  in  2015,  which  led  to  depression  and
anxiety.  He  acknowledged,  however,  that  his  debts  are  largely  due  to  his  own
mismanagement and financial irresponsibility, though it was during “a very dark, difficult
period in [his] life.” (1Tr. 34-36, 44, 49, 2Tr. 35-36, 48)
The delinquent debts alleged in the SOR include about $49,500 in student loans
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c, 1.f, 1.o, 1.p); credit-card debts of about $22,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, 1.g,
1.h,  1.i,  and  1.j),  along  with  smaller  phone  (SOR  ¶  1.k,  for  $155)  and  medical  debts
(SOR  ¶¶  1.l,  1.m,  and  1.n,  for  about  $700  total).  Applicant  denied  all  the  debts  in  the
SOR  but  clarified  at  his  hearing  that  he  acknowledges  responsibility  for  them  though
many are now paid. (1Tr. 47-48) The debts are established by the credit reports in the
record. (GE 2, GE 3, GE 4)
Applicant testified  that once  his employment stabilized, he  contacted  the student
loan  creditors to  renew  payments in about September 2019. Between  then  and  March
2020, Applicant made  six  or seven  monthly  payments of  $416  to  rehabilitate  his  student
loans.  (1Tr. 46-53) They  are all  now  considered  rehabilitated  and  no  longer delinquent.
(2Tr.  29-31;  AE   A,  AE   N-AE  R)   A   January   2022   credit  report  shows  that  Applicant’s
student  loans  are  in   “pays  as  agreed”   status.  (AE   M   at  29-83)   He   estimated   that  he
owes about $70,000  in  student loans,  both  public and  private. He  is making  payments
on  his private   loans   and  his federal   loans are  in   COVID-related  forbearance.   (2Tr. 36-
38) Applicant intends to  resume  payments on  those  plans once  the  forbearance  period
ends.   (2Tr.  31-32,  36-38;  AE   B)  While   this   case   was  pending   a   decision,  President
