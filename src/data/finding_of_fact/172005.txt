Per the SOR, Applicant has approximately $49,000 of debt. Applicant began falling
behind on his debts in 2018 when he was unemployed for three months. Subparagraph 1.a
is  a  delinquent  car  note.  The  balance  of  the  account  is  approximately  $27,000,  and
Applicant, as of the date of the SOR, was one month behind on the monthly payments of
$730.  (Answer  at  1)  SOR  subparagraph  1.b  is a  credit  card  account  totaling $16,148.
Applicant began using this credit card to make cash advances when he was unemployed.
The debt in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b is held by the same creditor.
Applicant is no longer behind on the delinquent car note alleged in subparagraph 1.a
and it is not in default. (Answer at 5) Subparagraph 1.b remains delinquent. On December
16, 2021, Applicant reached an agreement with the creditor. Under the agreement, he is to
resolve  the  debt  in  $200  monthly  payments,  beginning  December  30,  2021.  (AE  F)
Applicant’s counsel submitted the AE F on January 7, 2022, but did not provide proof that
the first payment was made on December 30, 2021, as required per the agreement.
SOR subparagraph 1.c, totaling $2,740, is a delinquent tuition payment. Applicant
was unaware of this debt. Specifically, after registering for a class with the university, he
dropped it and did not think he would owe the tuition for the entire semester. (Tr. 20) After
the  hearing,  Applicant  arranged  a  payment  plan.  Under  the  plan  he  was  make  $100
payments, beginning December 20, 2021. (AE E) He submitted AE E on January 7, 2022,
but provided no proof that he had made the first payment. Applicant had earlier promised
to make payment arrangements with this creditor, in response to interrogatories of June
2020. Applicant noted that he was going to contact the creditor. (GE 2 at 5)
SOR subparagraph 1.d, totaling $1,503, is a delinquent loan that Applicant used to
purchase furniture. (Tr. 20) He has been attempting to contact the creditor, but has thus far
been unsuccessful. (Tr. 20) It remains unresolved.
SOR subparagraph 1.e totals $1,032. After the hearing, Applicant contacted the
creditor and negotiated an agreement to satisfy the debt in the reduced amount of $671,
payable by February 14, 2022. (Tr. 23; AE C)
SOR subparagraph 1.f, totaling $502, is an allegedly delinquent phone bill. Applicant
disputes this bill. (Tr. 24) He provided no evidence substantiating the basis of the dispute.
SOR subparagraph  1.g, totaling  $81, is a  delinquent satellite  television  bill. Before
the  beginning  of  the  investigative  process, Applicant was unaware of  this debt.  (Answer at
2) Applicant satisfied  this bill in December 2021. (AE  D)
Applicant earns an annual salary ranging from $56,000 to $65,000, depending on
how  much  overtime  he  works.  (Tr.  16)  He  and  his  wife  have  approximately  $4,000
deposited  in  a  joint  checking  account.  (Tr.  40)  Applicant  testified  that  he  maintains  a
budget. (Tr. 22) He has approximately $1,000 of monthly discretionary income after bills
are paid. (Tr. 22) He did not provide a copy of his budget. In December 2020, Applicant
retained a credit repair agency to help him with his finances. (AE A; Tr. 42) He did not
elaborate about the services they have provided since he hired them.
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  in  June  2018.
Subparagraph 2.a alleges that he falsified his SCA by failing to list his delinquent debts in
response to Section 26, which reads as follows:
Other than  previously  listed, have  any  of  the  following  happened?  In  the  past
seven  years, you  had  bills or debts  turned  over to  a  collection  agency?  In  the
past seven  years, you  had  any  account or credit card suspended, charged
off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed?
Applicant had been making car payments on the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.a,
but  was  running  one  month  behind.  Subparagraph  1.b  had  been  charged  off  when
Applicant completed the SCA. Applicant was unaware that he owed the debts listed in SOR
subparagraph 1.c and 1.g. He denied SOR subparagraph 1.f. Although the debts listed in
subparagraphs 1.d through 1.f were delinquent when Applicant completed the security
clearance  application,  there  is  no  record  evidence  that  they  had  been  turned  over  to
collection, or charged off, and the record evidence is unclear as to whether they were more
than 180 days overdue when Applicant completed the SCA. (GE 3 at 2-4)
Applicant contends that he did not include the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.a
and 1.b because he electronically submitted an earlier SCA without double checking the
responses. (Tr. 47) Applicant had an opportunity to correct these discrepancies in 2018
when an investigative agent interviewed him and asked him whether he had ever been
more than 180 days late on debt payment in the past seven years. (Answer at 2) Applicant
failed to do so until confronted.
