allege and Applicant admitted that he had four delinquent medical debts for $100, $50,

SOR  ¶  1.p  alleges  and  Applicant  admitted  that  he  fell  behind  on  his  mortgage
payments  between  January  and  October  2014  due  to  his  gambling  habits.  (SOR

SOR ¶¶ 1.q, 1.r, and 1.s allege and Applicant admitted that he failed to timely file
his federal and state income tax returns for tax years (TY) 2013, 2014, and 2015. (SOR
response) At the time the SOR was issued, he owed federal income taxes for TYs 2013,
2014,  and  2015.  (Id.)  However,  during  his  March  15,  2019,  Office  of  Personnel
Management (OPM) interview, he said: (1) he had filed his tax returns for TYs 2013, 2014,
and 2015 in 2017; (2) he paid the taxes for TYs 2014 and 2015; and (3) he owed $4,500
for TY 2013. (GE 2 at 12) He said he did not timely file his tax returns because he owed
taxes. (Id.)
At his hearing, Applicant said he filed his tax returns for TYs 2013, 2014, and 2015
in  2018  or  2019.  (Tr.  42-43)  Most  of  the  delinquent  taxes  were  paid  in  2019,  and  the

Applicant’s  SOR  alleges  in  ¶¶  1.b  through  1.o  that  he  has  14  delinquent  debts
totaling  $37,768.  At  his  hearing,  he  said  in  late  2020  or  early  2021,  he  refinanced  his
house and received about $100,000. (Tr. 42, 45) After his hearing, he said the refinancing
was in June 2020. (AE D) He said the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f through 1.i, 1.n, and 1.o
were  paid  prior  to  refinancing  his  mortgage,  and  the  remainder  were  paid  after  he
refinanced his mortgage. (AE D) He said he had to pay his delinquent debts in order to
receive the funds from the mortgage company. (Id.)
Applicant’s  August  10,  2021  Equifax  credit  report  indicates  he  has  a  $515,871
mortgage account opened March 3, 2021, with a scheduled monthly payment of $2,099,
and this mortgage is in “pays as agreed”  status. (GE 16 at 3) He said that most of the
$100,000 was used to remodel the kitchen of his residence. (Tr. 42) He used some of the
remainder to pay all of the SOR debts. (Tr. 38) His August 10, 2021 Equifax credit report
shows the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b as a charged-off credit union account with first delinquency
in  July  2017  for  $15,552  with  an  actual  payment  of  $15,552,  a  charged-off  amount  of
$15,552,  and  a  zero  balance.  (GE  16  at  5-6)  It  also  shows  two  collection  accounts:  a

hearing that he paid the $15,552 debt in SOR ¶ 1.b. (AE D)
Personal Conduct
SOR  ¶  2.a  alleges  and  Applicant  admitted  that  the  Army  Criminal  Investigation
Command  (CID)  titled  Applicant  in  January 1999  for making  a  false  official  statement,
false  swearing,  indecent  acts,  and  sodomy.  (SOR  response)  Titling  is  a  legal  and  law
enforcement determination that probable cause supports commission of these offenses.
Applicant and eight other soldiers sexually assaulted an intoxicated 18-year-old female in
a barracks room on a military installation. (Tr. 23; GE 4) Some of the soldiers sexually
assaulted her while she was unconscious. (GE 4) Applicant denied his involvement in his
first statement to the CID. (Tr. 23; GE 4) Applicant subsequently provided a statement
admitting his role in the sexual conduct. (Tr. 23-24; GE 4) He asserted that the woman
consented to his sexual contacts. (GE 2 at 5-6) Applicant’s offenses were resolved under
Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). (Tr. 22) At his hearing, he said he
did not remember the offenses on his Article 15. (Tr. 23) His nonjudicial punishment (NJP)
included 45 days of extra duty and 45 days of restriction. (Tr. 22) The NJP record was not
admitted into evidence.
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges and Applicant admitted he received an Other Than Honorable
discharge from the Army in July 1999 based on the misconduct investigated by Army CID
in January 1999. (Tr. 24; SOR response)
SOR  ¶  2.c  alleges  and  Applicant  admitted  that  he  tested  positive  in  November
2004 in a urinalysis test for the presence of the cocaine metabolite in his urine. (Tr. 24;
SOR response) He said his spouse was heavily involved with cocaine, and he “got caught
up in it.” (Tr. 40) However, he said he only used cocaine once, and he was caught on the
urinalysis test. (Tr. 40-41; GE 2 at 6-7) He denied that he used any illegal drugs in the
previous 10 years. (Tr. 42) He received 45 days of extra duty, 45 days of restriction, and
reduction from specialist (E-4) to private (E-2) at an NJP proceeding held under Article
15, UCMJ. (GE 2 at 7)
SOR ¶  2.d  alleges and  Applicant admitted  that he  received  a  general discharge
under honorable  conditions in February  2005  because  of  the  conduct alleged  in SOR ¶
2.c.  (Tr. 24; SOR response)  His DD  Form  214  shows his discharge  was for misconduct.
(AE A)
SOR ¶ 2.e alleges and Applicant admitted that in June 2013, his employer issued
a warning to him for inappropriately clocking his spouse in and out from work on three
occasions in violation of company policy. (Tr. 28; SOR response) He said he clocked in
his spouse when she was in the parking lot so that she was not late for work. (Tr. 28)
SOR ¶ 2.f alleges and Applicant admitted he was convicted of driving under the
influence  of  alcohol  (DUI)  in  January  2004.  (Tr.  29;  SOR  response)  His  blood  alcohol
content was .13. (Tr. 40; GE 2 at 14) He was sentenced to 365 days in jail (suspended),
a $5,000 fine, and probation for five years. He received an alcohol-use evaluation which
determined he did not need alcohol treatment. (Tr. 40; GE 2 at 15) His current level of
alcohol consumption is one beer about every two months. (Tr. 30) There was no evidence
of binge-alcohol consumption or alcohol-related misconduct in the past 10 years.
SOR  ¶¶   2.g   and   2.h   allege   and   Applicant  admitted   that  he   contributed   to   his
spouse’s substance-use  disorder by  purchasing  heroin  for  her from  June  2014  to  October
2014.   (SOR  response)  Around   2013   or  2014,  Applicant’s  spouse   used   heroin   in  his
presence. (Tr. 34)  He  decided it was safer for him to purchase  heroin  for her than  for her
to  purchase  it  herself.  (Tr. 35) In  his April 18,  2018  SCA he  said he  “[p]urchased  small
amounts  of heroin  on  a  semi-weekly  basis for spouse’s personal  use  after spouse’s long-
term   pain   pill  prescription   was  terminated   and   up   until  spouse   went  into   inpatient
treatment program. Spouse  currently  on  daily  Suboxone  prescription.” (GE 1  at 39) His
first   involvement   with   heroin   was  in  “06/2014   (Estimated),”   and   his  most   recent  heroin
involvement   was  in  “10/2014   (Estimated)”   (Id.)  In   response   to   the   question   about  the
nature and  duration  of  the  involvement,  he  said  “[p]urchased  small  amounts for spouse’s
personal use a  few times a week.” (Id.)
During his March 15, 2019, OPM interview, Applicant said he purchased heroin for
her two to four times a week for $20 per visit. (GE 2 at 13)  At his hearing, he said he
purchased heroin for her on nine or ten occasions. (Tr. 35) He did not indicate what his
children were doing during those times when his wife was using the heroin he purchased
for her. Around late 2014 to early 2015, Applicant convinced his spouse that she should
enter an inpatient rehabilitation program. (Tr. 36) After completion of this program, she
did not resume her heroin use. (Tr. 36) She currently takes Suboxone in lieu of heroin.
(Tr. 36) Applicant advised the OPM investigator that his spouse failed a random urinalysis
and  lost  her  employment;  however,  he  did  not  indicate  the  particular  drug  she  was
accused of using or the date when she lost her employment. (GE 2 at 12) He said his
purchases of heroin were not common knowledge among his family members or friends
“as it is a very personal matter.” (Id. at 13)
SOR ¶¶ 2.i and 2.j allege and Applicant admitted he was arrested in August 2014
and October 2014, and charged with not using an ignition-interlock device on his vehicle
in violation of his probation resulting from the DUI conviction in SOR ¶ 2.f. (Tr. 30; SOR
response)  Applicant  said  he  drove  to  work  without  the  interlock  device  because  he
needed to get to work to earn money to pay for the interlock device.  SOR ¶ 2.l alleges
and Applicant admitted he received 30 days in jail (work release) in November 2014 for
violating  the  terms  of  his  probation  in  connection  with  his  failure  to  use  the  alcohol-
interlock device. (Tr. 30; SOR response)
SOR ¶ 2.k alleges and Applicant admitted that he received a one-day suspension
without  pay  in  November  2014  from  his  employer  for  not  maintaining  acceptable
attendance. (SOR response)
Character Evidence
When  Applicant was in the  Army, he   served  in an  imminent danger pay  area  in
support of Operation  Enduring  Freedom  in  Kuwait and  Iraq  from  April 14,  2003, to  April

showed  initiative  and  was  diligent,  responsible,  professional,  and  intelligent.  (Id.)  He
needed  no  supervision,  had  good  potential  for  rehabilitation,  and  made  important
contributions to mission accomplishment. (Id.) Several of their statements recommended
his retention in the Army. (Id.)
Applicant  said he  has learned from his mistakes.  (Tr. 39) He  is a  better person
now. (Tr. 39)
