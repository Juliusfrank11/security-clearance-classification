In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations, with explanations
for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k His admissions are incorporated in my
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 55-year-old graphic designer employed by a federal contractor since
September 2015. He has been employed by federal contractors since February 2006. He
was cleared for a position of public trust in May 2007 after disclosing delinquent debts in
a previous SCA. (FORM Item 5.) He has been married since January 1986 and has four
adult children. One of his daughters and her husband lost their jobs due to COVID-19 and
moved in with Applicant and his wife from June 2020 to August 2021, which increased
Applicant’s living expenses.
Applicant disclosed two delinquent debts in his SCA: an unresolved dental bill for
$1,459 from May 2014 and an unresolved car-repair bill for $7,000 in September 2015.
(FORM Item 3 at 29-30.) The creditor for the car-repair bill obtained a judgment against
him, which was satisfied in September 2019. (AX F.)
The  SOR  alleges  11  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $108,933.  The  debts  are
reflected  in  credit  reports  from  December  2021,  March  2020,  and  April  2017.  (FORM
Items 6, 7, and 8.)
On April 9, 2019, Applicant hired a law firm to assist him in resolving his debts. He
enrolled  in  a  42-month  program  with  an  estimated  completion  date  in  October  2022.
(Answer at 4-16; AX C.) He has paid the law firm $285 per month for two years and has
now increased his payments to $355 per month for the next three and a half years. His
estimated  completion  date  is  now  in  2025.  (AX  A  at  5)  The  delinquent  student  loans
alleged in the SOR are not included in the law firm’s program. The evidence concerning
the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.e: delinquent student loans totaling about $91,107. The March
2020 credit report reflected that the student loans were delinquent and had been assigned
to  the  government  in  2017.  On  March  27,  2020,  the  Coronavirus  Aid,  Relief,  and
Economic Security Act (CARES Act) became law, and it provided for relief measures on
Department  of  Education  (DoEd)-owned  federal  student  loans  through  September  30,
2020. In August 2020, Applicant signed an agreement to participate in a loan rehabilitation
program for these loans. In his application for the rehabilitation program, he reported that
his monthly income was about $10,000 per month and his monthly expenses, including
$570 in federal student loan payments, totaled about $9,470. He agreed to pay $133 per
month for nine months beginning in August 2020. (AX B.)
In Applicant’s cover letter to the FORM response, he declared his intention to begin
making payments in January 2022, when the CARES Act deferment  was scheduled to
end. On December 22, 2021, the COVID-19 emergency relief measures were extended
on  DoEd-owned  federal  student  loans  through  May  1,  2022.  Applicant’s  student  loans
have been in forbearance since  March 27, 2020. Notwithstanding the forbearance,  his
student loans were delinquent well before the forbearance went into effect. He has not
yet  completed  a  loan rehabilitation  program.  I  am  not  convinced  that  he  will  make  the
required payments on his student loans when they are no longer in forbearance.
SOR  ¶  1.f:  consumer  debt  placed  for  collection  of  $6,185.  This  debt  was
charged off in March 2017. In November 2021, Applicant settled this debt for $2,918. (AX
A at 4.)
SOR ¶ 1.g: consumer debt charged off for $5,687. This debt was charged off in
October 2016. (FORM Item 6 at 4) Applicant’s law firm has listed this debt as next in line
for resolution. (AX A at 4.)
SOR ¶ 1.h: consumer debt for $2,730. This debt was charged off in March 2017.
(FORM  Item  6  at  5.)  Applicant’s  law  firm  has  offered  to  settle  this  debt  for  $1,228.
Negotiations are still in progress. (AX A at 4.)
SOR ¶ 1.i: auto loan charged off for $620. This debt was charged off in October
2018. In Applicant’s answer, he stated that this debt was incurred when he cosigned an
auto loan for his son. He promised to resolve it by the end of 2020. A payment was made
in June 2021. (FORM Item 6 at 6.) A statement from his law firm reflects that the debt
was settled, but it does not reflect that the agreed amount has been paid. (AX A at 5.)
SOR ¶ 1.j: auto loan charged off for $2,554. This debt was charged off in October
2018. In Applicant’s answer, he stated that he was disputing the amount his gap insurance
paid  for  an  auto  that  was  totaled.  He  promised  to  resolve  this  debt  by  June  2021.  A
payment was made in August 2021. (FORM Item 6 at 6.) A statement from the law firm
reflects that the debt was settled, but it does not reflect that the agreed amount has been
paid. (AX A at 5.)
SOR ¶ 1.k: balance of $50 past due on an auto loan charged off for $1,073.
This debt was charged off in April 2016. When Applicant answered the SOR in November
2020, he promised that he would pay this debt by the end of 2020. It was still reflected in
the credit report from December 2021. (FORM Item 6 at 10.)
In  April  2019,  Applicant  purchased  an  automobile  with  a  defective  engine.  In
October 2021, he hired a law firm to sue the auto maker under the state’s “lemon law,”
after incurring an expense of $5,090 to replace a defective engine. (AX F at 3.)
In Applicant’s  response to the FORM,  he submitted evidence regarding another
auto loan on which two payments were late. This debt is not alleged in the SOR.
