Applicant  is  51  years  old.  He  graduated from  high  school in  1988.  He  attended
college between 2000 and 2003, and again between 2006 and 2019, but did not receive
a degree. Applicant has never been married, and he has no children.
Applicant work history shows four periods of unemployment, the result of being in
between contracts. He was unemployed between February and August 2009; between
August and November 2010; between April and May 2011; and he was laid off in July
2017 and unemployed until September 2017. He stated he worked part-time at a gym or
“other  gigs”  while  waiting  for  another  contract.  Except  for  the  above  periods  of
unemployment, Applicant has been working for federal contractors since November 2009.
He was hired by his current employer and security sponsor, a federal contractor, in April
2019. He is an Information Technology (IT) systems administrator. (Tr. 23) He is earning
about $93,000 a year. (Tr. 29)
Applicant submitted his most recent security clearance application (SCA) on April
9, 2019, seeking the continuation of his clearance eligibility required for his job. He stated
that other federal agencies granted him clearances in 2007 and 2009, and that the Office
of Personnel Management granted him eligibility for a secret clearance in 2009. (GE 1)
In  his  answers  to  Section  26  (Financial  Record)  of  his  2019  SCA,  Applicant
disclosed he was delinquent in four accounts including the car loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a
(surrendered in 2015, and owing $25,733); the credit card account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c
(delinquent in 2015, and owing $1,152); the delinquent rent alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g (owing
$5,822 since 2015); and the medical account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b (delinquent in 2016,
and owing $6,425).
Applicant  explained  that  his  financial  problems  were  the  result  of  periods  of
unemployment and underemployment. He works for federal contractors, and he is subject
to layoffs when the contracts end or his employers fail to renew the contract. He claimed
he had been in contact with his creditors trying to establish payment agreements or to
settle the accounts. He failed to present documentary evidence to substantiate his claim.
The SOR alleges nine delinquent debts, totaling about $41,000, which include two
charged-off  consumer  credit  accounts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.d);  and  seven  collection
accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e through 1.i). The remaining SOR allegation, SOR ¶
1.j, alleged that Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 2008, which was
discharged  in  April  2009.  (Tr.  40)  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  with
clarifications.
The status of the SOR allegations follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a ($25,733) concerns a car purchased in 2012. Applicant was unable to
make the car payments after he was laid off. He claimed he maintained contact with the
creditor  and  made  some  payments  with  the  help  of  his  mother  after  he  was  laid  off.
Ultimately,  he  surrendered  the  car  to  the  creditor  in  2015.  Applicant  received  a
Cancellation of Debt, Form 1099-C, for $23,712, dated December 31, 2021. (AE O) He
intends to file the document with is 2022 income tax return. (The 1099 is from 2021 so it
has to be the 2021 tax return.) He failed to present documentary evidence to substantiate
his claim of contacts with the creditor.
SOR ¶ 1.b ($6,425) alleges a medical account in collection. After he was laid off in
2015,  Applicant  travelled  to  another  state  and  was  hospitalized  and  treated for  kidney
stones in 2016. Applicant never made any payments toward this debt. In May 2021, he
contacted the creditor and was offered a $4,500 lump-sum settlement. He intends to take
out a loan to pay off the debt. (Tr. 48-50) This debt is unresolved.
SOR  ¶  1.c  ($1,152)  alleges  a  delinquent  credit  card  in  collection.  The  creditor
obtained a $1,152 civil judgment against Applicant in September 2017. (GE 7) Applicant
claimed he contacted the creditor on an unknown date before he received the February
2021  SOR,  and  then  again  on  April  19,  2021,  and  was  offered  a  $1,000  lump  sum
settlement.  He  satisfied  the  judgment  on  June  24,  2021.  (AE  R)  He  failed  to  present
documentary evidence to substantiate his claim of contacts with the creditor before April
2021.
SOR ¶ 1.d ($683) alleges a delinquent credit card in collection. Applicant opened
the account in 2013-2014 and it became delinquent when he lost his job around 2015. He
claimed  he  sporadically  contacted  his  creditors  telephonically  trying  to  settle  his
delinquent accounts. He claimed he contacted the creditor before he received the SOR
and made a settlement offer. The creditor agreed to settle the account for $480. Applicant
settled the account for less than owed and paid $480 on April 1, 2021. (AE B, AE T) He
failed  to  present  documentary  evidence  to  substantiate  his  claim  of  contacts  with  the
creditor before April 2021.
SOR ¶ 1.e ($444) alleges a charged-off credit card account. Applicant opened the
account in 2013-2014, and it became delinquent in late 2014. He contacted the creditor
after he received the SOR and made a settlement offer. The creditor agreed to settle the
account for $312. Applicant paid the account on March 29, 2021. (AE A, AE N)
SOR ¶ 1.f ($370) alleges a medical account in collection. After he was laid off in
2015,  Applicant  travelled  to  another  state  and  was  hospitalized  and  treated for  kidney
stones in 2016. The debt is for emergency services he received. Applicant never made
any payments toward this debt. He paid the debt after it was charged-off in October 2020.
(Tr. 62-64; AE F)
SOR ¶ 1.g ($5,822) alleges a delinquent lease in collection. After he was laid off
in 2015, Applicant was unable to make the rent payments, and he was evicted. (GE 7)
Applicant presented no documentary evidence of any payments toward this debt after his
eviction. He claimed he contacted the creditor trying to settle the account in 2020 and
2021,  but  the  negotiations  have  not  been  successful.  (Tr.  69-70)  He  presented  no
documentary evidence of his contacts with the creditor or of other efforts to resolve the
debt.
SOR ¶ 1.h  ($448) alleges a  medical account  in collection. After he  was laid  off  in
2015, Applicant travelled  to  another state  looking  for  employment and  was hospitalized
and  treated  for kidney  stones  in 2016. He believes the  debt is for medical services he
received  during  that period. Applicant paid the  debt after he  received  the  SOR. (Tr. 70-
71; AE C, I)
SOR  ¶  1.i  ($228)  alleges  a  delinquent  insurance  debt  in  collection.  After  he
surrendered his car, Applicant failed to pay his car insurance. He contacted the creditor
and settled the account for less than owed in April 2021. (AE, D, F; Tr. 70, 71)
SOR ¶ 1.j alleged that Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 2008.
The bankruptcy was discharged in April 2009. (Tr. 40) Bankruptcy is a legal recourse and
Applicant  was  entitled  to  obtain  financial  relief  and  secure  a  fresh  start.  A  Chapter  7
bankruptcy  discharge  releases  individual  debtors  from  personal  liability  for  unsecured
nonpriority debts and prevents the creditors owed those debts from taking any collection
action  against  the  debtor.  Applicant’s  SOR  debts  were  acquired  after  his  bankruptcy
discharge in 2009.
I  note  that  Applicant  has  student  loans  for  about  $50,000,  that  are  currently  in
forbearance and were not alleged in the SOR. On December 22, 2021, the DOE extended
the student loan payment pause through May 1, 2022. The pause includes the following
relief measures for eligible loans: a suspension of loan payments, a 0% interest rate, and
stopped  collections  on defaulted  loans. The Federal Student  Aid began  accepting and
reviewing applications from borrowers seeking loan forgiveness under the Public Service
Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program in the fall of 2017. Applicant presented no evidence
to show that he had applied for student loan forgiveness. He promised to pay his student
loans when they become due.
the  SOR  was
issued.  He  averred
Applicant  believes  that  circumstances  beyond  his  control  prevented  him  from
addressing his SOR debts between the time they became delinquent and February 2021,
that  his  periods  of  unemployment,
when
underemployment,  and  illness  (kidney  stones)  adversely  affected  his  ability  to  pay  his
financial obligations. Because of his low yearly income (below or about $63,000), he was
unable to recover from his financial problems  between 2015 and 2019. He averred his
income was insufficient to pay for his living expenses, current debts, and his delinquent
debts.  After  he  was  hired  by  his  current  employer  in  April  2019,  Applicant  has  been
making around $93,000 a year.
Applicant believes he has done his best to reestablish himself financially and to
pay  off  his  delinquent  debts.  He  stated  that  he  has  taken  a  loan  to  pay  off  the  two
remaining SOR delinquent debts. He believes that his financial situation is good. Except
for two delinquent SOR debts, he is current in his recent financial obligations. He believes
that his credit reports show that during the past three years he established a good credit
payment history on all the new accounts he opened to reestablish his credit worthiness.
Applicant presented no  documentary evidence of any contacts with creditors, of
any settlements made, of payment agreements established, or of  any payments made
before  the  SOR  was  issued.  Only  SOR  ¶  1.e  appears  to  have  been  paid  before  he
received the SOR. He was required to participate in financial counseling when he filed for
bankruptcy in 2008. He presented no evidence showing that he has participated in any
recent financial counseling.
Applicant  averred  he  has  a  working  budget.  (AE  U)  He  stated  that  he  now
understands what he needs to do to get his financial problems corrected and to establish
his  financial  responsibility.  Applicant  expressed  his  desire  to  resolve  his  financial
problems.  He  now  understands  the  seriousness  of  having  negative  information  on  his
credit. He promised to resolve the two remaining delinquent debts in the near future.
