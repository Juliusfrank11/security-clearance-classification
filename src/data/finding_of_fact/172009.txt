In  2013, Applicant matriculated  to  college  to  earn an  associate  degree. He opened
six  student-loan  accounts, as set forth  in subparagraphs 1.b  through  1.d, and  1.f  through
1.h  to  finance  the  education. (Item  1  at 3) By  the  time  Applicant graduated  in 2015, he  had
incurred  approximately  $40,000  of  student-loan  debt.  (Item  1  at 3)  In  early  2019, Applicant
missed   a  loan  payment.  (Item  1  at 3)  The  lender then  contacted  Applicant,  offering  to
arrange  a  weekly, wage  garnishment.  Applicant accepted  the  offer. Between  April 2019
and  February  2021, he  made  payments ranging  from  $148  and  $250. (Item  8) In  March
2021,  Applicant  opted   to   end   the   garnishment  payments  and   entered   the   federal
governmentâ€™s  loan   rehabilitation   program.  Under  this  plan,  his  wages  are  no   longer
garnished   and   he   now   pays  $561   per  month.  (Item   7)  He  has  been   paying   without
interruption since he  entered  this plan. (Item  7  at 1-3)  The  balance  of  these  student-loan
debts  alleged  in subparagraphs 1.(b)  through  1.d, and  1.f  through  1.h  totals approximately
$26,000, and the debts are no longer in delinquent status.  (Item 8 at 2)
