Applicant  was  arrested  in  September  2013  when  he  was  19  years  old  and
charged with assault causing bodily injury to a family member (or a person with whom
the  defendant  had  or  had  had  a  dating  relationship).  The  charge  was  dismissed  in
December  2014  after  the  county  attorney  moved  the  court  to  dismiss  the  charge
because  the  “evidence  [was]  insufficient.”  (Tr.  at  23,  26-28;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 1; AE C, D)
Applicant  denied  striking  the  mother  of  his  child.  He  credibly  stated  that  she
called  the  police  and claimed  that  he  pushed  her against  a  wall  after  he  asked  her  to
move  out of  his apartment.  Applicant has had  custody of  their child  since about 2015.
The mother was ordered to pay child support, but she made a few initial payments and
then nothing since. (Tr. at 23, 26-31; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1)
Applicant used marijuana sporadically from when he was a teenager until about
2017. His most recent use in 2017 was in a state where marijuana use was not against
state law. He used Xanax that was not prescribed to him in 2009 when he was in high
school.  He  used  cocaine  in  2011  and  2016. (Tr. at  24-25,  39;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 1)
Applicant  reported  his  use  of  marijuana  and  cocaine  on  the  Questionnaire  for
National Security Positions (SF-86) he submitted in January 2018. He has not used any
illegal drugs since 2017. He credibly testified that he wants to be a good role model for
his child, and he does not intend to use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future.

Applicant  has  a  history  of
to
unemployment  and  being  a  single  parent  without  the  benefit  of  child  support  from  his
child’s mother. He also admitted that he made irresponsible financial decisions, such as
buying  a  vehicle  that  was  more  than  he  could  afford.  The  SOR  alleges  a  $17,987
defaulted auto loan and 19 additional delinquent debts totaling about $7,637. (Tr. at 23-

financial  problems,  which  he  attributed
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a $17,987 defaulted auto loan. The vehicle was repossessed
in  about  2017,  leaving  a  deficiency  of  $17,987  after  it  was  sold  at  auction.  Applicant
initiated  a  $505  monthly  payment  plan  in  April  2021  (after  the  SOR  was  issued,  but
before  he  received  it). He  made  ten  payments  through  January 2022,  totaling  $5,050.
The balance in February 2022 was $13,156. (Tr. at 20-22, 32-33; Applicant’s response
to SOR; GE 1-4; AE A, B)
Applicant  paid  the  $817  delinquent  payday  loan  (SOR  ¶  1.c)  in  February 2021.
He paid the $817 delinquent telecommunications debt (SOR ¶ 1.m) in about May 2020.
(Tr. at 38; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE A)
Applicant asserted that he paid the $459 and $397 delinquent debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.d
and 1.e) owed to a collection company on behalf of two financial institutions. He stated
that  he  changed  banks  and  did  not  have  documents  establishing  the  payments.  The
debts  are  reported  by  all  three  credit-reporting  agencies  on  the  February  2018
combined credit report, and they both appear on the March 2020 Equifax credit report.
The  debts  do  not  appear  on  the  October  2021  Equifax  credit  report  nor  the  February
2022  Experian credit report. The debts did not “age off” the  reports because  they were
not  past  the  seven-year  reporting  window.  One  of  the  financial  institutions  issued
Applicant a new credit card in June 2020, which bolsters his assertion that he paid the
older  credit  card  account.  I  find  that  both  debts  have  been  paid.  (Tr.  at  37-39;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE A)
Applicant denied owing the $150 and $87 delinquent debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.o
and 1.q. He attempted to contact the creditors, but the creditors could not confirm that
he owed the debts. The $150 debt is reported by all three credit-reporting agencies on
the February 2018 combined credit report. The $87 debt is reported by TransUnion on
that  report.  Neither  debt  is  reported  on  any  subsequent  credit  report.  (Tr.  at  21;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE A)
Applicant denied owing the 13 delinquent medical debts alleged in the SOR. The
debts are listed on the February 2018 combined credit report, the March 2020 Equifax
credit report, or both credit reports. None of the debts are reported on any subsequent
credit report. Four of the alleged debts do not identify a creditor. He stated that he paid
four of the debts. He attempted to contact the creditors for the remaining debts, but the
creditors could not confirm  that he  owed the  debts.  (Tr.  at  21; Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 2-4; AE A)
Applicant  paid  other  debts  that  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR. With  the  possible
exception  of  one  unidentified  $250  medical  debt,  none  of  the  SOR  debts  became
delinquent  after  2018.  The  defaulted  auto  loan,  which  he  has  been  paying  since  April
2021,  is  the  only  delinquent  account  with  a  balance  reported  on  the  two  most  recent
credit  reports.  He  stated  that  he  planned  to  continue  paying  that  debt  and  he  will  be
debt-free  within  two  years.  He  stated  that  he  learned  from  his  mistakes  and  poor
financial decisions, and his finances are greatly improved. He follows a noted financial
expert, but he has not received formal financial counseling. (Tr. at 20-24, 40-45; GE 2-4;
