The SOR, as amended, alleged that Applicant owed $332,265 for 20 delinquent or
past-due debts (SOR 1.a – 1.p and 1.r – 1.u). Also alleged was a mortgage in foreclosure
with a $276,088 balance due. The debts at SOR 1.a, 1.g, 1.t – 1.u are for unpaid medical
services totaling $19,099. In response, Applicant admitted, with explanations, all of the
SOR allegations. (Answer) In addition to the facts established by Applicant’s admissions,
I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 47 years old and has worked for a defense contractor since January
2018.  She  worked  for  federal  contractors  between  2002  and  2006,  then  was  self-
employed until 2017 as the owner of a small defense contractor, which she ran with her
then-husband. Applicant served as an enlisted member of the United States Marine Corps
(USMC) between 1993 and 2008, when she was honorably discharged. Applicant has a
solid reputation with her employer and with their government customer. She is regarded
as a hard worker and a productive member of the contract team to which she is assigned,
and she volunteers at her church in her spare time. (GX 1; GX 2; AX A; AX D – G; Tr. 42
– 43)
Applicant was married between 2000 and 2002. She has a 21-year-old child from
that marriage whom she has raised without financial assistance and for whom she has
paid college tuition. Applicant remarried in August 2002 but divorced in August 2020. It
was with her second husband that she ran her small business. They have two children
whom Applicant is raising with little or no financial support from their father. (GX 1; GX 2;
AX K; Tr. 37 – 38, 54)
The SOR allegations are supported by her disclosures of financial problems in her
e-QIP  (GX  1)  and  by  credit  reports  obtained  as  part  of  the  ensuing  background
investigation and adjudication. (GX 3 – 6). Applicant discussed the debts alleged during
personal  subject  interviews  conducted  on  August  8  and  15,  2019  (GX  2),  and  she
admitted  to  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  (Answer).  At  the  outset,  Department  Counsel
conceded that the debts at SOR 1.b, 1.i, and 1.j had been resolved. (AX B; AX C; AX I;
Tr. 14 – 15)
Applicant attributes her financial problems to a business downturn in late 2016 and
her divorce in 2020. As to her business, her company worked as a subcontractor on a
project for which a much larger company was the prime contractor. When that company
lost the contract, Applicant’s company was unsuccessful in its bidding to continue working
on  the  next  contract,  and  she  had  to  look  elsewhere  for  new  business.  Thereafter,
Applicant and her ex-husband had mixed success generating revenue for their company.
Applicant’s  ex-husband  also  became  less  involved  in  the  company  so  that  he  could
pursue  unrelated  personal  interests.  Applicant  took  her  current  job  in  2018  because
income from her company no longer could support their family. She also took a part-time
job starting to make ends meet in late 2017. Additionally, unexpected medical problems
adversely affected her finances when she had unplanned surgeries in March 2017 and
March  2018.  Even  though  she  had  medical  insurance,  her  deductibles  were  high  and
posed unexpected expenses she struggled to pay. Applicant and her ex-husband began
divorce proceedings in late 2019. The legal expenses of a contentious divorce, as well as
his  lack  of  financial  support  also  have  hurt  her  finances.  Further  contributing  to  her
financial problems has been her commitment to pay college tuition for the child of her first
marriage, whose father has not supported in that regard. That child will graduate in the
spring of  2022.  Applicant’s second  husband  was unemployed  when  they  divorced  and
was ordered to pay only $250 a month to augment medical insurance for her younger
children. (GX 1; GX 2; AX F; Tr. 47 – 53)
Applicant started her small business in State A. In August 2005, she and her ex-
husband bought a house there. The mortgage debts at SOR 1.q and 1.p were obtained
to finance 80 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of the purchase price of that home. In
2007,  they  bought  a  home  in  State  B  to  be  closer  to  the  largest  of  her  company’s
customers. When they moved, they had difficulty selling the house  in State A due to a
weak housing market. They had sporadic success renting it while it was listed for sale,
and they eventually resolved the SOR 1.q mortgage in 2019 by selling it for far less than
the total balances owed on the three related mortgages. Available information shows that
both  accounts  are  still  outstanding  as  either  foreclosures  or  as  charge-offs  of  the
deficiency due after sale of the house. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3 – 6; AX B; Tr. 75 – 89)
In February 2007, Applicant and her ex-husband paid $500,000 for their first house
in State B. The mortgage debts at SOR 1.k, 1.m, and 1.o are equity loans associated with
this property. In May 2012, Applicant and her ex-husband bought and moved into another
house  in  State  B.  Because  the  housing market  continued  to  underperform,  they again
had difficulty selling the first house, again having mixed success renting the property while
it  was  listed  for  sale.  The  primary mortgage  of  $400,000  was  foreclosed  in  December
2017. One of  the equity loans, either SOR  1.m or 1.o,  was  used to  pay the remaining
$100,000 for the purchase price. The SOR 1.k loan was used to finance installation of a
pool soon after Applicant and her ex-husband moved in. The foreclosed first mortgage
was not addressed in the SOR. The debts at SOR 1.k, 1.m, and 1.o remain unresolved.
They  are  joint  liabilities  which  Applicant  believes  her  ex-husband  should  help  resolve.
She reports that he will not respond to her requests to do so. Applicant is unable to pay
anything meaningful toward these debts and is waiting for them to fall off her credit history
by  2025,  when  the  seven-year  reporting  period  under  the  Fair  Credit  Reporting  Act
(FRCA) expires. (GX 2 – 6; AX B; Tr. 68 – 80)
Applicant and her ex-husband bought the second State B house for $875,000. The
mortgage  debt  alleged  at  SOR  1.i  represents  the  primary mortgage  for  that  purchase.
Applicant and her ex-husband made their last payment on that mortgage in May 2018.
Applicant  and  her  ex-husband  lived  together  in  the  house  from  the  time  divorce
proceedings  were  initiated  in  2019  until  they  sold  the  house  in  April  2020.  This  sale
satisfied the mortgage at SOR 1.i. Applicant acknowledges that the decision to move in
2012 was purely discretionary, and in hindsight, that it was a poor decision  by her and
her ex-husband. (GX 1 – 6; AX B; AX I; Tr. 60 – 68, 104 – 105)
The debts alleged at SOR 1.a –  1.g, 1.t and 1.u are for unpaid medical bills. As
noted above, Applicant underwent emergency surgery in 2017 and in 2018. Although she
had medical insurance, she estimates the deductible for each procedure was as high as
$5,000. In addition to information showing she has paid the debt at SOR 1.b, Applicant
averred  that  her  remaining  medical  bills  totaled  $12,839  and  were  owed  to  a  single
medical creditor not specified in the SOR. The debt at SOR 1.h is for a delinquent credit
card  account  totaling  $21,345.  Applicant  used  the  card  to  cover  expenses  when  her
business  started  failing  and  her  ex-husband  was  out  of  work.  Applicant  had  another
delinquent  card  for  $6,597  with  the  same  creditor.  The  creditor  apparently  agreed  to
$12,986 in satisfaction of those debts. When Applicant and her ex-husband closed the
sale  of  their  second  State  B  house  in  April  2020,  Applicant’s  medical  debts  and  the
delinquent credit cards were paid directly from the proceeds of sale. (Answer; GX 1 – 6;
AX B; AX C; AX I; Tr. 55 – 60, 81 – 84)
The net proceeds from the April 2020 sale of Applicant’s house provided Applicant
and  her  ex-husband  with  $135,230,  which  they  split  evenly  through  their  divorce.
Applicant used her share ($67,615) to buy a car because her’s had been repossessed in
October 2018, as addressed at SOR 1.l. Applicant has also used this money to pay her
divorce-related  legal  fees  and  to  pay  college  tuition  for  her  oldest  child.  She  paid  the
$2,508 debt alleged at SOR 1.j and began addressing smaller medical and other debts
of which she was aware at the time. The SOR 1.l debt for $9,970 (amended from $46,165)
is for the remainder after resale of a repossessed car. Applicant chose to pay other debts
and to support her son’s education, while allowing this debt to drop from her credit history
after seven years in 2024 or 2025. (Answer; GX 1 – 6; AX B; AX C; AX I; Tr. 64, 98 – 99)
The debts at SOR 1.r and 1.s also remain unresolved. They are delinquent credit
card accounts in Applicant’s name, which she avers were used by both her and her ex-
husband, and for which she believes he is jointly responsible. She further claimed that
their debts were divided between them in their divorce decree, a copy of which she stated
she would provide post-hearing but did not. (Answer; GX 1 – 6; AX B; Tr. 94)
Applicant testified that her current finances are stable, in that, she is able to meet
all of her regular monthly expenses. She further explained that her decision to let some
of her debts fall off her credit history after seven years is an acknowledgment that she will
be unable to resolve larger debts related to mortgages and repossessions for which her
ex-husband is jointly liable. Nonetheless, she is trying to resolve her more modest debts,
such as her medical bills and retail credit card debts left from her marriage. Applicant also
has eschewed credit cards, choosing to live on a cash-only basis. She has cut expenses
where possible, has a second job, and has started saving money, albeit at a modest rate.
She has not engaged in any formal credit counseling or financial management assistance,
choosing instead to research debt resolution strategies on her own. Applicant insists she
is doing the best she can to resolve her debts and manage  her finances appropriately;
however, she sometimes is hindered by unexpected expenses, such as a recent major
car repair. (Answer; AX F; AX H; Tr. 84 - 90)
