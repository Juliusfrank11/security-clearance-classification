Applicant  denied  all of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.  After a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 41 years old. She has never married. She has three children, ages 23,
11 and 4 years old. Her eldest is presently not working. Applicant provides support to all
of  them.  She  also  provides  some  support  for  her  grandchild.  She  testified  that  she
receives child support for the middle child, but the father is not current with his payments
and  has  only  started  to  pay  since  2021.  The  father  of  her  youngest  child  provides
occasional support, but not regularly. (Transcript (Tr.) 20-22, 83, 87)
Applicant’s current annual salary since July 2021 is about $92,000. Before that it
was about $78,000, and earlier it was  about $62,000. She has worked for her present
employer, a federal contractor, since August 2017. She has been steadily employed since
2003,  except  for  a  period  from  June  2017  to  July  2017,  when  she  had  health  issues
related to her pregnancy, and from January 2010 to December 2010, due to budget cuts.
(Tr. 23-26, 32-33, 37-38; GE 1)
Applicant had lived with her mother, but moved out in January 2019. She moved
back  in  in  November  2021,  along  with  her  two  youngest  children.  She  attributes  her
financial  problems  to  being  a  single  parent,  health  issues,  and  medical  expenses.
Applicant stated that her medical issues began in about 2017. She has medical insurance,
but she estimated her out-of-pocket medical expenses are about $1,000 annually. (Tr.
26-27, 31, 34-37)
Applicant attended college from 1999 until May 2002. She did not earn a degree.
She resumed school at a different college from January 2003 until December 2014. She
financed  her  education  with  student  loans.  She  needs  three  more  classes  to  earn  a
degree. (Tr. 29-30; GE 1)
The SOR alleged eight delinquent consumer debts, one medical debt, and three
student loans totaling approximately $60,334. Applicant disclosed the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a
($617) on her August 2019 security clearance application (SCA) and indicated it was a
collection account, caused by a decrease in her income. She indicated it was resolved in
August 2019 because she was on a repayment plan. She testified the account was paid
after  the  creditor  contacted  her  and  agreed  to  settle  the  debt  for  $112.  She  provided
documents to support the settlement offer and that it was paid in May 2020. The debt is
resolved. (Tr. 40, 43-45; GE 1; AE A, E)
The  collection  account  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  ($462) was  for  cable  and  Internet  service.
Applicant  testified  that  she  returned  the  equipment  and  owed  a  balance  of  $228.  She
arranged a settlement agreement with the creditor to pay $20 a month, but only made
one  payment  last  year,  and  did  not  follow  through  with  the  agreement.  The  debt  is
unresolved. (Tr. 45-47; GE 3, 4. 5)
The  collection  account  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  ($18,157)  is  for  a  car  loan  for  a  vehicle
purchased  in  2018.  Applicant  testified  that  she  got  behind  a  few  times  in  her  monthly
payments,  but  she  is  still  paying  on  the  account  and  has  possession  of  the  car.  The
monthly payment is $466. Her January 2022 credit report reflects that the account is past
due  $9,710,  and  the  current  balance  is  $15,618,  which  reflects  that  she  has  made
payments,  but  they  were  insufficient  to  cover  the  past-due  amount.  She  provided  a
document from the creditor indicating she had made a payment arrangement on February
20, 2022, to pay $500. She did not provide evidence that this payment was made or the
arrangement was to make monthly payments. The debt is unresolved. (Tr. 48-51; GE 3,
4, 5; AE C).
The charged-off account in SOR ¶ 1.d ($12,834) is a vehicle repossession from
2015. Applicant testified that she received an IRS Cancelation of Debt Form 1099C. She
provided  a  copy  of  the  2019  form  reflecting  the  amount  alleged  as  discharged.  She
testified that she filed the form with her income tax returns. This debt was not resolved.
(Tr. 51-53; GE 3, 4, 5; AE D)
The  charged-off  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  ($269)  was  for  a  personal  loan  Applicant
obtained in 2012 or 2013 to improve her credit score. She testified that she made sporadic
payments, and a year ago she contacted the creditor wanting to pay the debt. She testified
her  last  payment  was  sometime  last  year.  She  does  not  have  a  monthly  payment
arrangement,  but  rather  will  make  payments  when  she  can  until  it  is  resolved.  She
provided  a  copy  of  her  account  statement  from  October  2021  to  December  2021  that
reflects a balance owed of $219. The debt is unresolved. (Tr. 53-57; AE F)
The charged-off debt in SOR ¶ 1.f ($554) is a store charge card. Applicant testified
that she made payment arrangements to settle the account for $332. She agreed to make
six payments of $55, but only made one payment last year and no other payments since.
The debt is unresolved. (Tr. 57-58; GE 3, 4, 5)
Applicant testified that the delinquent medical debt alleged in SOR  ¶ 1.g ($364)
was for medical equipment that was returned. She provided a document from the creditor
showing her account has a zero balance. The debt is resolved. (Tr. 58-59; AE I)
The charged-off debt in SOR ¶ 1.h ($711) is for a credit card. In Applicant’s SOR
answer she said payment arrangements had been made. She testified at her hearing that
she did not have payment arrangements with the creditor. The debt is unresolved.  (Tr.
59-62; GE 3, 4, 5)
The collection account in SOR ¶ 1.i ($716) is for a credit card. In Applicant’s SOR
answer,  she  said  she  was  going  to  validate  the  debt  with  the  creditor  and  if  it  was
confirmed then she would make payment arrangements. She testified that she contacted
the creditor, but did not make payment arrangements. The debt is unresolved. (Tr. 62-63;
GE 3, 4, 5)
The SOR alleges delinquent student loans in ¶¶ 1.j ($1,251), 1.k ($3,945) and 1.l
($20,454). Applicant did  not disclose these debts  on her 2019 SCA.  She  stated  in her
SOR answer that she “was able to get account out of default. Was set up for a repayment
program  which  included  paperwork  and  documents  and  place[d]  on  a  payment  plan.”
(Answer to SOR) Her loans are in deferment due to the CARES Act, which provided a
moratorium on student loan payments during the COVID-19 pandemic. (Tr. 63-72; GE 3,
4)
Applicant testified that she thought she had consolidated her student loans in 2009
or 2010. She also has other student loans. Her January 2022 credit report reflects student
loan accounts totaling approximately $77,917 opened from 2004 to 2008. They too are
deferred. It is unknown if some of her student loans have been consolidated. She testified
she  contacted  the  creditor  in  the  past  and  thought  that  her  student  loans  were  in
forbearance. She was attending college sporadically, but not since 2014. She confirmed
she made no payments towards her student loans from 2014 to 2020, when they were
deferred due to the pandemic. Applicant’s September 2019 credit reports lists the student
loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l as delinquent. (Tr. 63-72; GE 3, 4, 5)
Applicant provided a document from a collection company servicing the student
loans alleged in the SOR. Due to the way Applicant copied the document, the date on the
letter does not appear. The document notes that the total delinquent balance owed to the
SOR  creditor  is  $27,069  and  that  Applicant  had  indicated  a  wish  to  rehabilitate  the
defaulted student loans. She was offered a repayment amount of $5  a month and was
required to sign the agreement. Applicant did not provide any other documents to show
she  has  completed  the  paperwork  required  to  participate  in  a  rehabilitation  program.
When  asked  how  she  intended  to  resolve  her  student  loan  debt  once  the  deferment
expired, she said she would work out something she could afford. Applicant provided a
statement in a post-hearing email. Regarding the student loans alleged in the SOR, she
said that she made a few payments, but never completed a payment program. She had
recently contacted the original creditor and the loans were in default. She spoke with a
representative  who  mailed  her  a  form  to  complete  to  request  approval  for  a  new
repayment  program.  She  was  waiting  for  the  forms.  I  note  that  regardless  of  her
conversation with the creditor, the student loans are likely deferred under the CARES Act,
and are not presently in a default status. (Tr. 63-73; AE G, H, J)
Applicant has two consumer accounts (1-$334, 2-$393) that are past due on her
most recent credit report and are not alleged in the SOR. She opened Account 1 in August
2021, and it became past due in December 2021. Account 2 was opened in November
2020, and it became past due in October 2021. She obtained a loan ($3,165) in December
2020  that  is  charged  off.  The  date  of  last  activity  is  May  2021.  She  had  a  credit  card
account opened in December 2020, last activity was April 2021, and it was charged off
($655). Applicant leased an automobile, and it was repossessed in 2018 when she got
behind in payments. The credit report lists the charged-off amount of $5,557. Applicant
testified that she was unaware a balance was owed on the vehicle and the creditor has
not contacted her and she has not contacted them. Applicant testified that she incurred
these  debts  when  she  was  living  on  her  own  with  her  children  and  not  living  with  her
mother. Paying her monthly expenses was difficult. (Tr. 74-86; GE 5)
Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered
for disqualifying purposes. It may be considered when making a credibility determination,
in the application of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis.
Applicant  has  not  sought  any  financial  counseling.  When  interviewed  by  a
government  investigator  in  October  2019,  she  described  her  finances  as  a  work  in
progress. She testified that that is still the case. She testified that she wants to improve
her credit and can do better. She wants to be in a better place, financially. She does not
maintain a budget. (Tr. 82-83, 94-96)
