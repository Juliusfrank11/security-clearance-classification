In   his Answer, Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶   1.a  – 1.c,  and   denied   SOR  ¶¶   1.d –
1.f. He did not  provide  any  explanation addressing  the SOR allegations, or documentary
evidence   along   with   his  Answer.  Applicant’s  admissions   are   incorporated   into   the
findings  of   fact.   After  a   thorough   and   careful  review   of   the   pleadings  and   evidence
submitted, I make the  following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  40  years  old.  He  has  been  employed  as  a  program  manager  by  a
defense contractor since 2019. This is his first application for a security clearance. He
earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2005,  and  a  law  degree  and  an  MBA  in  2016.  He  has
been  steadily employed  since 2000, and was  working full time while  he was  attending
school. (Item 2)
In  his  background  interview,  Applicant  stated  that  some  of  his  debts  became
delinquent  in  2017  because  he  was  helping  his  mother  pay  her  mortgage  and  bills,
approximately $800 - $1000 a month. His father had passed away three years prior, in
about  2014.  He  prioritized  helping  her  with  her  finances  over  his  own  debt  payments.
He asserted that he is still paying $400  - $500  monthly  for his mother’s expenses. He
also  cited the high  cost  of  living,  inflation, and his lack of  pay raises  and cost of  living
adjustments as other reasons for his financial troubles. (Item 3)
The   SOR  alleges  six   delinquent  debts,   totaling   approximately   $38,000.  Five   of
these   debts  are  charged   off,   and   one   is  in  collection   status.   The   allegations  are
established   by   Applicant’s  admissions  and   the   2020   credit   report.   Applicant  did   not
provide  any  documentation  to  show  the  current status of  the  SOR debts.  (Items 1, 2, 3,
4) The  status of  the debts follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a is an education loan that is in collection in the amount of $17,160. The
date of last activity on the account was January 2017. As noted above, Applicant stated
in  his  background  interview  that  that  he  prioritized  other  expenses  and  helping  his
mother, over this debt. He hopes to make payment arrangements when he has a better
paying job. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4)
SOR  ¶  1.b  is  a  student-loan  debt  that  was  charged  off  in  January  2018,  in  the
amount  of  $11,032.  Applicant  stated  in  his  background  interview  that  he  called  the
creditor to reestablish payments, and that he has been paying $110 monthly. However,
he provided no substantiating documentation. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4)
SOR ¶ 1.c is an auto loan that was charged off in January 2018, in the amount of
$3,917.  He  stated  in  his  background  interview  that  when  this  account  became
delinquent in 2017, he made partial payments for about eight months, but then stopped
because he could no longer afford to do so. He claimed that he contacted the creditor in
2020 after receiving a notice in the mail about the debt. He was waiting on the creditor
to send him a payment plan, and said he intends to start making payments on this debt.
(Items 1, 2, 3, 4)
SOR  ¶  1.d  is  a  credit  card  that  was  charged  off  in  September  2019,  in  the
amount  of  $2,804.  In  his  background  interview,  he  gave  the  reason  for  the  financial
issue  as  the  high  cost  of  living.  He  claimed  that  he  set  up  a  payment  plan  with  the
late  2019,  approximately  $200  monthly,  however,  he  provided  no
creditor
substantiating documentation. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4)
in
SOR ¶ 1.e is a credit card that was charged off in February 2020, in the amount
of  $1,425.  In  his  background  interview,  he  said  the  reason  for  the  financial  issue  was
because  of  Inflation,  and  because  he  did  not  receive  a  pay  raise  or  cost  of  living
adjustment. He claimed that he called the creditor in 2020 after receiving a notice about
the  debt  in  the  mail.  He  was  waiting  on  the  creditor  to  send  him a  payment  plan,  and
intends to start making payments on this debt. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4)
SOR ¶ 1.f is a credit card that was charged off in August 2019, in the amount of
$1,421.  In  his  background  interview,  he  said  the  debt  was  due  to  helping  his  mother,
increased expenses due to inflation, and not receiving a pay raise. He claimed that he
called the creditor after receiving a notice about this debt in late 2019. He was waiting
on  the  creditor to  send  him  a payment plan, and  intends to  start making payments on
this debt. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4)
Since  he  did  not  provide  any  documentation  with  his  Answer,  and  did  not
respond  to  the  FORM,  Applicant  did  not  provide  any  documentary  evidence  showing
that any of his debts have been or are being paid, disputed, or otherwise resolved. He
also submitted no documentation concerning his current financial situation, such as his
monthly income and expenses, his assets, or whether he follows a budget. He provided
no evidence of credit counseling.
