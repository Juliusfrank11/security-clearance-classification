In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denied  the  financial  allegations  in  ¶¶  1.a
(owing a creditor $154,615 for a loan in collection), and 1.b (owing a bank $10,392 for an
account  in collection). He  admitted  SOR  ¶ 1.c  (owing $360,000 to the  Small Business
Administration (B) on a delinquent account). His SOR admission and those at his hearing
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence,
I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is 65 years old. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1977 and served over 22
years on active duty until he was honorably retired in January 2000. His service included
assignments to the Special Forces for 10 years, followed by assignments to signal and
intelligence  commands.  Since  he  retired,  Applicant  has  been  working  for  federal
contractors  providing  radio  and  communications  support  to  several  highly  sensitive
Government agencies. He has held eligibility for a clearance since 1978, sometimes at
the  top-secret  or  higher  levels.  There  is  no  evidence  of  any  other  security  concerns,
except for those alleged in the SOR. He married his wife of 40 years in 1982, and has
one adult daughter.
Sometime  before  2015,  Applicant’s  late  brother  (D),  asked  him  for  financial
assistance to purchase a supermarket franchise (store). D was the general manager for
a supermarket in the state where he and Applicant were born and raised. D proposed that
he  would  manage  the  store’s  daily  business  because  of  his  expertise,  and  Applicant
would be a silent investor-partner. Applicant lacked the expertise to manage a store, and
he had a full-time job and lived in another state. Applicant agreed.
Applicant and D purchased the store franchise for about $1 million. They came up
with about $500,000 from their savings and retirement accounts. For the remainder of the
price, D and Applicant took out a $643,00 Small Business Administration loan from the
creditor  alleged  in  SOR  1.c  (B).  Applicant  became  the  majority  stake  holder  in  the
business with 51 percent ownership, and his brother was the minority stake holder with a
49 percent ownership. They incorporated their business, and the supermarket opened for
business around October 2015. (Tr. 47-51)
The  store  did  well  for  the  first  two  years,  making  about  $2  million  in  2016,  and
about $3 million in 2017. Applicant testified the income was reinvested into the store, and
used  to  pay  employees  and  operational  expenses.  (Tr.  51-52)  Applicant  reported  the
business  increased  earnings  to  his  employer  and  supervisors  to  avoid  any  security
issues. He purchased a luxury car and a sports car in 2016-2017. As of January 2022, he
owed $19,293 on the luxury car loan, and $21,298 on the sports car loan. Both accounts
are current and in good standing. (AE 2; See AE 19.a)
In  late  2017,  D  had  several  strokes  and  was  hospitalized.  Thereafter,  he  was
unable to manage the store and an assistant manager was appointed. Applicant believes
that the assistant manager did not pay the incoming bills and misappropriated the store’s
money. He did not file charges or a claim against the assistant store manager.
In  about  June  2018,  Applicant  received  letters  from  the  store’s  landlord  and  a
creditor  indicating  that  a  loan  and  the  lease  were  delinquent.  Applicant  testified  he
contacted the creditors and explained to them that his brother was in the hospital. He then
tried to make things right. He called the store twice a week trying to assess the situation
and provided whatever help he could to manage the store.
When the store was failing, Applicant took out two personal loans trying to keep
the  store  functioning.  He  borrowed  $150,000  from  the  creditor  in  SOR  ¶  1.a,  and  a
$50,000 loan from EFG (a financial group not alleged in the SOR). The money from both
loans was supposed to be used to pay employee wages and store expenses; however,
according to Applicant the store manager did not pay the bills and $20,000 of money in
reserve disappeared. Applicant closed the store mid-2018. (Tr. 53-55)
While the  store was in business, it was repaying  both  of Applicant’s personal loans.
About $30,000  of  the  $50,000  loan  was paid  before the  store closed.  For the  remaining
balance,   Applicant   negotiated   a   $500   monthly   payment   plan   with   EBF.   Between
November 2019  and  March 2021, Applicant made  17  payments  for a  total  of $8,500.  (AE
13)  As   of  February   2022,  Applicant   owed   only   $5,040.  (AE   13,  14)   At   his  hearing,  he
anticipated  paying  the remainder of  the  debt in  October 2022.  He then  intends to  apply
the  payment to other debts.
Applicant believes that the store payments reduced the $150,000 loan alleged in
SOR ¶ 1.a, to about $90,000 by the time the store closed. He testified that in late-2018
early-2019, he attempted to establish a repayment plan with the creditor alleged in SOR
¶ 1.a, similar to the one he established with EBF, but the creditor refused. (Tr. 54-55) He
did not provide copies of any letters sent to the creditor offering to settle the debt. After
the store closed in late 2018, Applicant made no more payments to the creditor alleged
in SOR ¶ 1.a. The creditor has not contacted Applicant requesting repayment of the loan
since  the  store  closed  in  late-2018,  and  it  has  not  filed  for  collection  or  obtained  a
judgment against Applicant. (Tr. 56-57)
Applicant testified that when the store closed, it had paid about $343,000 of the
$643,000 SBC loan he and his late brother took out from B, and it owed about $300,000.
Applicant  believes  that  the  account  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  has  been  satisfied,  because
when the store closed, B took possession of all the merchandise and equipment inside of
the store to offset the store’s debt. After B took the  store’s merchandise and  property,
Applicant  did  not make  any further payments  on the  account, and he said the  creditor
never sought any additional payments. According to Applicant, the creditor did not attempt
any further collection, and it has not  filed for collection or obtained a judgment against
him. The creditor did not initiate a recovery action against the estate of Applicant’s brother.
Applicant does not know the status of the account or whether he owes any money. (Tr.
37, 55-56, 59)
The store owed about $100,000 in rent to the landlord when it closed. Applicant
testified that the landlord waived collecting the past-due rent because another company
wanted  to  lease  Applicant’s  store.  (Tr.  37)  Applicant  believes  that  the  other  company
assumed his lease. (Tr. 55) Applicant consulted with attorneys and has considered filing
for bankruptcy, but so far has decided against it. He notified the federal agency he was
working for about the possibility of having to file for bankruptcy because the business was
failing. (Tr. 37, AE 12)
Applicant opened the credit card account with the creditor alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b to
pay for store expenses trying to keep it open. SOR ¶ 1.b alleged one account (ending in
0279) in collection for $10,392. Applicant’s documentary evidence shows that he settled
the account for $4,157 in March 2021, and paid it off in twelve monthly payments of about
$346 between March 2021 and February 2022. SOR ¶ 1.b is resolved in Applicant’s favor.
(AE 1, 15, and 19.c)
Applicant also opened two lines of credit accounts with the same creditor to pay
for store necessities. As of January 2022, both line of credit accounts had a balance of
about $19,000 each. (See AE 5, 6) As of the hearing day, both accounts were current
and were not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 44-46, AE 2) In addition to the accounts previously
mentioned,  as  of  January  31,  2022,  Applicant  was  making  monthly  payments  on  the
following  accounts:  1)  a  mortgage  payment  of  $1,992,  on  a  $316,161  mortgage.  The
home has an estimated value of $609,800. (AE 3, 4); 2) a credit card owing $17,292 (See
AE 7 and AE 19.b); 3) a charge card owing $2,759; 4) a charge card owing $4,873; 5) a
charge card owing $8,106; 6) an unsecured loan owing $433; and 7) an unsecure loan
owing $3,145. (See AE 2)
As of the time of his hearing, Applicant’s annual gross salary was about $123,000.
Additionally, he earned about $8,400 a year from two part-time jobs; $26,400 a year from
his military retirement; about $36,000 a year from his service-related disability retirement;
and  $9,600  a  year  from  a  company’s  retirement,  for  a  total  annual  income  of  over
$203,400. Applicant believes that he is currently financially stable. His income allows him
to pay his living expenses and his debts, except for the two debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a
and 1.c. He intends to retire in 2023. He believes that his retired income will allow him to
continue paying his debts. (See AE 17, 18) If the creditors alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c
file collection actions against him, Applicant will try to make payment arrangements with
them. If they refuse to make payment arrangements, he believes that he may be forced
to file for bankruptcy.
Applicant has not participated in financial counseling recently. However, he noted
he  has  consulted  with  attorneys  about  the  possibility  of  filing  for  bankruptcy.
Notwithstanding, his documentary evidence is sufficient to show he is following a budget
and paying his debts, except for the accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c. I note that
he has not acquired any additional delinquent debts since 2018.
Applicant submitted three reference letters, including two from direct government
supervisors  and  his  federal  contractor  manager.  Applicant  has  been  working  with  a
sensitive federal agency since 2013. He has been entrusted with sensitive and classified
information for several programs. He  is considered to be a man of  high  character and
integrity. Both supervisors trust him with classified and national security information and
would welcome him back to work with the agency. (AE 8)
Applicant’s financial problems were caused by his failed business. He has learned
a  hard  lesson  as  a  result  of  his  financial  problems  and  the  clearance  process.  He
understands that he has to maintain financial responsibility to be eligible for a clearance
and to retain his job. He promised to maintain financial responsibility. He noted that he
has  increased  his  credit  score  to  717.  He  believes  this  demonstrates  his  improved
financial responsibility. (AE 19.e) His financial problems were caused by circumstances
beyond  his  control  and  are  unlikely  to  recur in  the  future.  He  believes  that  his  military
service, along with his many years working sensitive positions for federal agencies, show
that he will not be a security risk.
