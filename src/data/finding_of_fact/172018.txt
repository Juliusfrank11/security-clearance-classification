In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and
1.b, with explanations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 58 years old. He graduated from high school in 1982. He married in
1989  and  has  three  adult  stepchildren.  He  was  employed  from  October  2005  to  June
2016,  and  has  worked  for his current  employer  since  April  2017. He  was  unemployed
from June 2016 to April 2017. (Item 3)
The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file, as required, Federal and state income
tax  returns  for  tax  year  2018,  and  that  he  owes  approximately  $10,000  in  delinquent
Federal income taxes, and approximately $3,000 in delinquent state income taxes for tax
year 2018. (Item 1)
In his March 2020 SCA, Applicant reported that he failed to file Federal and state
income tax returns for tax year 2018, and estimated his combined tax debt to be $13,000.
He explained that he did not file the returns or pay the required income taxes because he
could not pay the taxes due. He attributed his financial difficulties to his wife’s retirement
and his failure to withhold sufficient funds to pay taxes incurred when he withdrew funds
from a retirement account in order to pay bills. He stated his intent to pay down the debt
with anticipated tax refunds and then to negotiate payment plans with Federal and state
tax authorities. (Item 3)
During his background interview with a government investigator on April 9, 2020,
Applicant confirmed he had not filed or paid his Federal and state income taxes for tax
year 2018. He reported commercial software he used to prepare his income tax returns
in early 2019 reflected that he owed approximately $10,000 in Federal income taxes, and
$3,000 in state income taxes. He decided not to file the income tax returns because he
could  not  afford  to  pay  the  amounts  due.  He  attributed  his  financial  difficulties  to  a
reduction in income after his wife was injured and unable to work  or run her business,
and  a  greater  than  anticipated  tax  liability  for  a  $30,000  withdrawal  from  a  retirement
account he used to pay bills. He acknowledged that he had not contacted Federal or state
tax authorities regarding his delinquent taxes. He stated his intent to use anticipated tax
year  2019  income  tax  refunds  to make payments  on  the  delinquent  taxes  and  to  then
negotiate payment plans with Federal and state tax authorities. (Item 4)
In his August 2021 answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations at SOR
¶¶  1.a,  and  1.b.  He  stated  he  delayed  filing  the  income  tax  returns  because  he  was
worried he could not afford the payments due. He attributed his financial difficulties to his
failure to  withhold sufficient funds to  pay  taxes due  on  funds withdrawn  from  a  retirement
account to  pay  off  his mortgage  and  bills associated  with  his wife’s business, and  to  her
injury  and  subsequent retirement.  He  stated  he  was in the  process of  paying  off  the  IRS
debt  and  provided  the  first page  of  a  five-page  IRS  Notice  CP521  addressed  to  him  and
his wife  dated  March  17, 2021. The  IRS  notice  references  his  installment agreement  for
tax  year 2018, reflects  the  amount owed  ($14,480.39), monthly  payments  due  ($286.00),
that the  last  payment  amount ($286.00) was  made  on  March  2, 2021, and  that the  next
payment  ($286.00) was due March 28, 2021.  (Item  2)
Applicant failed  to  timely file  his  Federal  income tax return for tax year 2018. A
Federal income tax return for tax year 2018 was apparently filed sometime after his April
9, 2020 background interview and on or before March 17, 2021, the date of the IRS Notice
CP521, because a  “request for an  installment agreement will be  denied  if any required
tax  returns  haven’t  been  filed.”  https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i9465  (Instructions  for
Form 9465 (10/2020)). (Items 2, 3, 4)
Applicant did not claim or provide documentary evidence to show that he filed the
state  income  tax  return  for  tax  year  2018  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a,  or  that  he  paid  the
delinquent  state  income  taxes  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  He  did  not  provide  evidence,
documented or otherwise, of his current financial budget, savings or expendable income.
