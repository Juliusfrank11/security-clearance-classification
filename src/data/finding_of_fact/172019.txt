In Applicant’s SOR response, he  admitted all of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) He
also provided extenuating and mitigating information. (Id.) His admissions are accepted
as findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  35-year-old  nuclear  inspector,  who  has  worked  for  a  defense
contractor for three years. (Tr. 6-7; GE 1) In 2006, he received a General Educational
Diploma  (GED).  (Tr.  6)  He  has  some  college  credits;  however,  he  did  not  receive  a
degree. (Tr. 7) He has not served in the military and has never been married. (Tr. 7) He
does not have any children. (Tr. 7)
Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges five student-loan debts totaling $31,425, which were placed for
collection as follows: ¶ 1.a for $9,646; ¶ 1.b for $8,801; ¶ 1.d for $5,685; ¶ 1.e for $5,326;
and ¶ 1.f for $1,967. His SOR also alleges a charged-off vehicle-related loan in ¶ 1.c for
$6,772 and two delinquent medical debts in ¶ 1.g for $1,427 and ¶ 1.h for $194.
Applicant went to  a  college  that  was implicated  in fraudulent  activity.  (Tr. 16) The
college  closed,  and  the  credits he  earned  were not transferable because  the  college  was
not  accredited.  (Tr. 45-46) He  made  some  payments  on  his  student loans.  (Tr. 45)  He
believed   he   could   be   released   from   liability   for  his   student  loans.   The   Department  of
Education  (ED) holds the  student loans in SOR ¶¶  1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and  1.f.  About two
years ago, Applicant contacted  ED  and  learned  ED  wanted  him  to  start payments. (Tr.
17) Applicant was trying  to  get a  deferment until he  could obtain a  release  from  the  student
loans.  (Tr. 17-21) He said his most recent  credit report does not  reflect his student-loan
debts.  (Tr. 17-18)  However,  his  January 31,  2020  credit  report,  the  most  recent  credit
report of record, states the five student loans were opened in the 2011 to 2013 timeframe
and reflects their transfer to collection status in 2017. (GE 3) The amounts in the SOR
are the amounts the five accounts are shown as delinquent in this credit report. (GE 3)
He does not have any documentation showing he attempted to settle his ED debt. (Tr.
18)
On  February  4,  2022,  the  Federal  Student  Loan  Borrower  Defense  Customer
Service emailed Applicant and advised him:
We  have  received  your  application  for a  borrower defense  discharge  of  your
dent loans under the  borrower defense  to  repayment rules  at 34
federal stu
C.F.R. §  685.206(c)  (2017).  .  . . We  will notify  you  once  a  decision  has been
made  on  your application.  If  your borrower defense  claim  is approved, we
will  determine  how  much  debt relief  (0%   -100%) to  provide  based  on  the
amount  of financial harm  you  suffered as a  result of your school’s conduct.
(AE C)
On March 25, 2022, ED emailed Applicant and gave him updated information about his
borrower  defense.  (AE  C)  ED  advised  that  he  could  provide  additional  information  to
assist in reconciling his claims. (Id.) In 2018, Applicant’s federal income  tax refund was
diverted to pay his student-loan debt. (GE 2) His student loans are no longer in collection
status pending resolution of his claim. (AE C)
As for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c for $6,772, Applicant said he borrowed money in 2012
to purchase a car, and it was voluntarily repossessed. (Tr. 20) He made $100 to $150
monthly payments for about five years to address this debt. (Tr. 19; AE B) He believed
this account was in good standing. (Tr. 19) On January 31, 2022, the creditor wrote that
he paid off 95 percent of the loan and now owes $1,246. (AE B)
SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h allege and Applicant admitted that he had delinquent medical
debts for $1,427 and $194. (SOR response) He had some discussions with creditors or
collection  agents.  (Tr.  22)  He  is  considering  some  options  on  how  to  settle  the  larger
medical  debt.  (Tr.  22)  He  believes  he  paid  the  smaller  medical  debt.  (Tr.  23-24)  His
January 31, 2020 credit report shows both debts are in collections. (GE 3) His January
31, 2020 credit report also shows that his non-SOR debts are paid or current. (GE 3)
Criminal Conduct
SOR ¶ 2.l alleges in about December 2006, Applicant was charged with failure to
appear on a misdemeanor charge, and in about February 2007, he was convicted of this

misdemeanor. (GE 5)
SOR  ¶  2.h  alleges  and  Applicant  admitted  that  in  about  March  2012,  he  was

police;  and  he  was  convicted  of  a  parole  violation.  (Tr.  27;  SOR  response)  A  parole
violation is a misdemeanor offense.
SOR ¶ 2.c alleges and Applicant admitted that in about December 2018, he was
charged with driving with a suspended driver’s license and fail to obey highway sign. (Tr.
26;  SOR  response)  Under  state  law,  driving  with  a  suspended  driver’s  license  is  a
misdemeanor, and fail to obey traffic sign is a traffic infraction and not a criminal offense.
SOR ¶  2.b  alleges in about January  2019, Applicant was charged  with  driving  with
a  suspended  license.  He said  when  the  police  officer stopped  him, he  became  aware that
his driver’s license  was suspended. (Tr. 26) The  police  officer issued  a  ticket to him. (Tr.

(GE 2) Under state law, illegally using a handheld personal communications device while

Applicant said he touched a person he considered a friend on her shoulder, and he said
“I hope you feel better.” (Tr. 32) In his August 8, 2019 OPM interview, Applicant said he

given  an  opportunity  to  disclose  the  firing  for  sexual  harassment  during  his  OPM
