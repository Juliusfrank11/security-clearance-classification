Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He is 52 years old. He married in
1994, divorced in 2002, and he has two adult children. He graduated from high school in
1987,  and  he  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1991.  He  previously  resided  in  a
condominium that he purchased in state A (Condo 1) from 2004 to 2014. (Answer; Tr. 1
at 9-10; Tr. 2 at 17-18, 35-37, 43, 47, 55; GE 1, 2; AE A, F)
Applicant was first granted a security clearance in approximately 2008. He worked
for previous DOD contractors from around 2002 to 2016. Since then and as of the date
of  the  hearing,  he  worked  as  an  assistant  administrator  for  his  employer,  a  DOD
contractor. (Tr. 1 at 6, 9-10; Tr. 2 at 5-6, 16, 54; GE 1; AE E)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  15  delinquent  debts,  comprised  of  5
delinquent consumer accounts totaling approximately $149,390 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.f, 1.i, 1.k,
1.o), and 10 delinquent mortgages culminating in property foreclosures in approximately
2014,  2015,  and 2016 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.e, 1.g-1.h, 1.j, 1.l-1.n). The SOR  allegations  are
established  by  Applicant’s  admissions  in  his  Answer,  in  his  2017  security  clearance
application (SCA), during his two interviews with a background investigator in 2018, in his
2020  response  to  interrogatories,  and  by  credit  bureau  reports  from  2017,  2019,  and
2020.  Applicant  testified  that  he  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  because  he  thought  he
would get his security clearance renewed. He testified that he did not believe the SOR
was correct, stating, “I don’t see account numbers. I don’t see property addresses.” He
also testified that he could not recall his 2018 interviews with a background investigator,
and  that  any  admissions  he  made  during  the  interviews  or  in  his  2020  response  to
interrogatories he did because he thought he would get his clearance renewed. (Answer;
GE 1-5; Tr. 2 at 18-19, 47-48, 65-68, 75-76)
All of the SOR debts revolve around properties purchased by Applicant. In 2004,
he purchased for cash Condo 1, as stated above, in which he resided until 2014. He later
obtained a first mortgage and a home equity line of credit (HELOC) through  Bank 1 on
Condo 1, as further discussed below. In 2008, he purchased five investment properties
consisting of the following: (1) two condominiums in state A (Condo 2 and Condo 3); (2)
a townhome in state A (TH); and (3) two homes in state B (Home 1 and Home 2). His tax
accountant  since  1988  advised  him  against  buying  the  investment  properties,  but  he
believed that state A would not be affected by the economic downturn that had already
begun in late 2007, and he thought he would be able to handle the two smaller homes in
state  B.  In  purchasing  his  five  investment  properties,  he  opened  five  additional  first
mortgages and a second  HELOC; he already had a first  mortgage and a HELOC with
Bank 1 for Condo 1, as above discussed. He had “. . . a total of eight loans around 2008,”
consisting of six mortgages and two HELOCs. His loans totaled approximately $500,000.
He could not recall the details surrounding these loans, but recalled that he put 20% down
on each of the properties by using a portion of the $500,000 he inherited after his parents’
death. (Tr. 2 at 35-43, 47-5, 51, 54-69, 75-85; GE 1, 2)
Applicant testified that from approximately 2008 to 2014, he was somewhat able
to use the rental income from his investment properties to pay the associated expenses.
He stated that he did not fully understand the extent of investment real estate expenses
and  acknowledged,  “I  didn’t  know  what  I  was  doing.”  He  stated  that  his  investment
properties were rented at times and unrented at other times, and he was unsuccessful in
getting his tenants to consistently pay their rent. He testified that his tenants refused to
pay  their  rent  when  the  economy  crashed  in  2008,  so  he  used  his  money  to  pay  the
mortgages on his investment properties; he hired attorneys to evict his tenants; he used
his money to make necessary repairs to the properties; and he obtained new tenants. He
could not recall the specific details surrounding each property. (Tr. 2 at 35-43, 47-5, 51,
54-69, 75-85; GE 1, 2)
By  2009, Applicant realized  he  had  made  a  mistake. He  again  consulted  with  his
tax  accountant,  who  advised  him  to  get rid  of his investment properties.  He  chose  not  to
do  so  because  he  continued  to  believe  he  could maintain  them. He consulted  with  his tax
accountant  every   year   subsequent,   and   he  repeatedly   received   the   same   advice.   By
2014, Applicant exhausted  all  of his inheritance. He  did  not have  any  money  set aside,
other than  his retirement accounts,  and  he  decided  not  to  use  his  retirement  money  to
pay  his mortgages.  He  last  consulted  with  his tax  accountant in  2014, and  he  was advised
to   contact   the   banks   and   work  something   out.   He   testified   that   he   was  “emotionally
devastated   that  I  was  so   wrong   on   the   real  estate   market,   but   I  bought  the   wrong
properties at the  wrong  time  and  I wasn’t thinking  clearly.” (Tr. 2  at  35-43, 47-5, 51, 54-
69, 75-85; GE 1, 2)
Applicant chose to walk away from his real estate investments. He stopped paying
his mortgages on all of his properties in 2014 and his properties were foreclosed. He did
not contact his creditors to seek a loan modification on any of his mortgages; he did not
attempt to sell his properties; and he did not seek any legal advice. He testified that when
he  walked  away  from  his  properties,  he  was  “under the  assumption  that  I  would  have
seven years of bad credit and that my credit would get better after the loans  would be
charged  off.”  He  acknowledged  that  the  first  time  he  attempted  to  contact  any  of  the
creditors for his SOR debts was in June 2021.  He testified  that “if it’s not on  my credit
[report], I think I’m okay. That’s my belief. That was my understanding in 2014.” (Tr. 2 at
35-43, 47-5, 51, 54-69, 75-85; GE 1, 2)
Applicant also testified that in addition to trying to maintain the mortgage payments
on all of his properties, he also paid for both of his children’s college tuition through his
retirement annuity from approximately 2012 through 2018. He also testified that he was
paying  approximately  $2,237  monthly  in  child  support  for  his  youngest  child  until  May
2018. He acknowledged  that he  could not handle his debts.  (Tr. 2  at 35-43, 47-5, 51, 54-
69, 75-85; GE 1, 2)
SOR ¶¶  1.a, 1.e, and  1.m are  for Condo  1. SOR ¶  1.a  is for  Applicant’s  Bank  1
HELOC; SOR ¶  1.e  is for Applicant’s Mortgage  Servicer 1  mortgage; and  SOR ¶  1.m  is
for Applicant’s  Mortgage  Servicer 2  HELOC.  The  2017  credit  bureau  report reflects that:
(1)  Applicant  obtained  a  mortgage  with  Bank 1  of  approximately  $150,000  in  2006; (2)
Applicant’s  Bank  1   mortgage   was  reported   as  delinquent  in   2014   and   transferred   to
another  lender;  (3)  Applicant  obtained   a   mortgage   with   Mortgage   Servicer  1   of
approximately  $150,000  in 2006;  and  (4) Mortgage  Servicer 1  foreclosed  on  Condo  1  in
2017.   The   2020   credit  bureau   report  reflects  a   zero  balance   for  Applicant’s  Bank  1
mortgage, but notes that  its status is delinquent and  the account has been  transferred or
sold.  That credit bureau  report does not report Applicant’s Mortgage  Servicer 1  mortgage.
Neither  the   Bank   1   nor  the   Mortgage   Servicer  1   mortgages  are   reported   on   the   2021
credit bureau report.  (Tr. 2 at 19-20, 37, 34-47, 65-68; GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; AE G)
The 2017 credit bureau report also reflects that: (1) Applicant obtained a HELOC
with Bank 1 of approximately $57,652 in 2007; (2) Applicant’s HELOC was reported as
delinquent  in  2014;  and  (3)  Applicant’s  HELOC  was  placed  for collection  by Mortgage
Servicer 2 in the approximate amount of $57,854. The 2019 credit bureau report reflects
that Applicant’s Bank 1 HELOC was $18,046 past due with a total outstanding balance of
$61,581. Applicant’s Bank 1 HELOC is not reported on the 2020 or 2021 credit bureau
reports. (Tr. 2 at 19-20, 37, 34-47, 65-68; GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; AE G)
Applicant testified:
I believe  [SOR  ¶ 1.a]  was a  mortgage  but  that mortgage  was for $150,000
and   there’s no  way   I paid it   down  to  [$61,000].  So,   I   think   [SOR  ¶ 1.a]  is
wrong. I think [SOR ¶ 1.a] should be  the  mortgage  [on  his residence  in  state
A] but that’s clearly not . . . That could be the  HELOC but I don’t know.
He also testified that he was unaware which property was associated with his Mortgage
Servicer  1  mortgage.  However,  he  disclosed  in  his  SCA  that  his  Mortgage  Servicer  1
mortgage was associated with Condo 1. He also discussed during his second interview
with a background investigator in 2018 (Interview 2), his Bank 1 and Mortgage Servicer
1 mortgages on Condo 1, as well as his Bank 1 HELOC on Condo 1, placed for collection
by Mortgage Servicer 2. (Tr. 2 at 19-20, 37, 34-47, 65-68; GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; AE G)
Applicant testified that he telephonically contacted Bank 1 in approximately June
2021. He testified that Bank 1 told him that it had a record of him having a previous loan
with them, but there was no indication of a delinquency due to the age of the loan. He
also  testified  that  he  unsuccessfully  attempted  to  contact  Mortgage  Servicer  1,  and
unsuccessfully attempted to contact Mortgage Servicer 2 in June 2021. He testified that
he  did  not  know any  further  details  about  these  debts;  he  could  not  recall  whether  he
received an IRS Form 1099 (1099) for his Bank 1 or Mortgage Servicer 1 mortgages; if
he did, he would have given any 1099s to his tax preparer; and, he did not believe any of
these debts were reported on his 2021 credit bureau report. He provided documentation
reflecting that he  received  an  IRS  Form  1099-A  (1099-A) from  Mortgage  Servicer 1  in
February  2016,  which  reflects  a  fair  market  value  of  his  property  of  $149,999  and  a
$125,802 outstanding principal balance. While the 1099-A also noted that Applicant was
personally liable for repayment of the debt, Applicant did not have a deficiency balance
on his Mortgage Servicer 1 mortgage. (Tr. 2 at 26-27; GE 2, 3, 4; AE J)

The 2017 and  2019  credit bureau  reports reflect,  in conjunction  with  Applicant’s
disclosures  in  his  SCA  and  during  Interviews  1  and  2,  the  following  for  Home  1:  (1)
Applicant obtained a mortgage with Bank 2 for approximately $47,100 in 2008; (2) this
mortgage was reported as delinquent in 2014 and transferred to another lender; (3) Bank
3 foreclosed on Home 1 in 2014; and (4) Debt Collector placed for collection Applicant’s
mortgage with Mortgage Servicer 3, in the approximate amount of $49,556, in 2016. The
2020 and 2021  credit bureau  reports do  not report Applicant’s mortgages with  Bank 2,
Bank 3, or Debt Collector for Mortgage Servicer 3. (Tr. 2 at 20-26, 33-35, 44-45, 52-54,
63-68; GE 2, 3, 4; AE H, I)

Applicant obtained a mortgage with Bank 2 for approximately $29,625 in 2008; (2) this
mortgage  was  reported  as  delinquent  in  2014  and  transferred  to  another  lender;  (3)
Mortgage  Servicer  4  initiated  foreclosure  proceedings  on  Home  2  in  2016;  and  (4)
Mortgage Servicer 5 foreclosed on Home 2 in 2016. The 2020 and 2021 credit bureau
reports  do  not  report  Applicant’s  mortgages  with  Bank  2,  Mortgage  Servicer  4,  or
Mortgage Servicer 5. (Tr. 2 at 20-26, 33-35, 44-45, 52-54, 63-68; GE 2, 3, 4; AE H, I)

also as discussed by Applicant during Interview 2. (Tr. 2 at 20-26, 33-35, 44-45, 52-54,
63-68; GE 2, 3, 4; AE H, I)
The  2017  and  2019  credit bureau  reports reflect,  in conjunction  with  Applicant’s
disclosures  in  his  SCA  and  during  Interviews  1  and  2,  the  following  for  Condo  2:  (1)
Applicant obtained a mortgage with Bank 2 for approximately $157,500 in 2008; (2) Bank
2  foreclosed  on  Condo  2  in 2014;  and  (3)  Debt Collector  placed  for collection  in 2017,  a
$44,116  loan  obtained  by  Applicant in 2014  with  Bank 4.  The  2019  credit bureau  report
reflects that Applicant’s outstanding  balance  with  Debt Collector for Bank 4  was $37,718.
The  2020 and  2021  credit bureau  reports do not report Applicant’s mortgages with  Bank
2  or  Debt Collector for Bank  4.  (Tr. 2  at 20-26,  33-35,  44-45,  52-54,  63-68;  GE  2,  3, 4;  AE
H,  I)
Applicant testified that although he admitted these allegations, he was unsure why
he had three different Bank 2 mortgages. He acknowledged that he became delinquent
on  a  Bank  2  mortgage  and  he  had  a  property  foreclosed  in  2014,  but  he  was  unsure
whether the foreclosed property was associated with any of the three Bank 2 mortgages.
He was aware that these Bank 2 mortgages had been reported on a credit bureau report,
but he testified that he did not have any outstanding debts with Bank 2 as of the date of
the hearing. He testified that he telephonically contacted Bank 2 in June 2021 and Bank
2  told  him  that  while  he  once  had  a  loan  with  them,  it  could  not  provide  him  with  any
further details. (Tr. 2 at 20-26, 33-35, 44-45, 52-54, 63-68; GE 2, 3, 4; AE H, I)
Applicant testified that he could not recall which property was associated with his
Bank  3  mortgage,  and  he  stated  that  Bank  3  had  no  record  of  this  account.  He  also
testified that he did not know the details about his loan with Bank 4, placed for collection
by Debt Collector, to include whether it was attached to any of his foreclosed properties.
He also testified that he did not know which property was associated with his mortgage
with Debt Collector for Mortgage Servicer 3, to include the balance due at foreclosure or
whether the reported outstanding balance was accurate; Debt Collector failed to send his
requested outstanding balance when he contacted this creditor in June 2021; and he did
not follow up with this creditor. He also testified that he could not recall which property
was  associated  with  his  Mortgage  Servicer  4  mortgage,  and  he  stated  that  Mortgage
Servicer 4 did not have any record of this debt when he contacted Mortgage Servicer 4
in June 2021. He acknowledged that he had a property foreclosed in 2016, but he was
unsure whether it was associated with a mortgage with Mortgage Servicer 5. He testified
that he telephonically contacted Mortgage Servicer 5 in June 2021 and Mortgage Servicer
5  told  him  that  while  he  once  had  a  loan  with  them,  it  could  not  provide  him  with  any
further details. (Tr. 2 at 20-26, 33-35, 44-47, 52-54, 63-68; GE 2, 3, 4; AE H, I)
Applicant also testified that he could not recall whether he received a 1099 for any
of  his  mortgages  with  Bank  2,  Bank  3,  Debt  Collector  for  Bank  4,  Debt  Collector  for
Mortgage Servicer 3, Mortgage Servicer 4, or Mortgage Servicer 5. He stated that if he
did, he would have given them to his tax preparer. He stated that when he attempted to
obtain  his  1099s  from  his  tax  preparer,  his  tax  preparer  told  him  that  they  had  been
shredded. He testified that he contacted Bank 2 and requested a copy of any 1099s they
sent him, but the creditor did not do so. Documentation provided by Applicant reflects that
Applicant and Bank 2 corresponded by email regarding his mortgages for Home 1 and
Home  2  in  June  2021.  The  emails  reflect  that  Bank  2  provided  Applicant  with
documentation  concerning  both  mortgages  in  attachments  to  its  emails;  however,
Applicant did not provide the referenced attachments at hearing. (Tr. 2 at 20-26, 33-35,
44-45, 52-54, 63-68; GE 2, 3, 4; AE H, I)
SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g are for TH. SOR ¶ 1.f is for Applicant’s  Bank 5  charged-off
HELOC,  as  discussed  by  Applicant  during  Interview  2.  The  2017  credit  bureau  report
reflects that Applicant obtained this Bank 5 HELOC in 2007 and Bank 5 charged off the
HELOC in 2017 for $34,999. This charged-off debt continued to be reported on the 2019,
2020, and 2021 credit bureau reports. SOR ¶ 1.g is for Applicant’s Bank 5 mortgage, as
disclosed and discussed by Applicant in his SCA and during Interview 2. The 2017 credit
bureau  report  reflects  that  Applicant  obtained  this  Bank  5  mortgage  for  approximately
$152,000  in  2006,  and  Bank  5  foreclosed  on  TH  in  2015.  The  foreclosed  status  of
Applicant’s Bank 5 mortgage continued to be reported on the 2019, 2020, and 2021 credit
bureau reports. (Tr. 2 at 24-30, 53, 63-68; GE 2, 3, 4, 5; AE G, K, L)
SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i are for Condo 3. SOR ¶ 1.h is for Applicant’s Bank 5 mortgage,
as disclosed and discussed by Applicant in his SCA and during Interview 2. The 2017
credit  bureau  report  reflects  that  Applicant  obtained  this  Bank  5  mortgage  for
approximately  $114,825  in  2007,  and  Bank  5  foreclosed  on  Condo  3  in  2014.  The
foreclosed status of this Bank 5 mortgage continued to be reported on the 2019 credit
bureau report; it was not reported on the 2020 or 2021 credit bureau reports. SOR ¶ 1.i
is  for  Applicant’s  mortgage  with  Mortgage  Servicer  3,  placed  for  collection  by  Debt
Collector for $25,140 in 2017, as discussed by Applicant during Interview 2.  The 2017
credit bureau report reflects that Debt Collector placed this loan, originally obtained by
Applicant with Mortgage Servicer 3, in collection for $25,140 in 2017. This loan with Debt
Collector continued to be reported on the 2019 credit bureau report; it was not reported
on the 2020 or 2021 credit bureau reports. (Tr. 2 at 24-30, 53, 63-68; GE 2, 3, 4, 5; AE
G, K, L)
Applicant acknowledged he had two properties foreclosed in 2014 and 2015 that
he financed through three loans with  Bank 5, but he testified that he could not identify
what SOR ¶ 1.f was for, and he could not distinguish SOR ¶ 1.f from SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1h.
He testified that he contacted Bank 5; Bank 5 gave him two 1099s; he provided the 1099s
to his tax accountant; and he believed his  tax accountant included these 1099s on his
relevant  income  tax  returns.  Documentation  provided  by  Applicant  reflects  that  he
contacted Bank  5 regarding  his mortgages for TH and  Condo 3  in June  2021.  Bank 5
provided him with a substitute Form 1099-A in January 2016 for TH mortgage, reflecting
a  $144,500  fair  market  value  of  his  property  and  a  $139,923  balance  of  outstanding
principal.  While  the  substitute  Form  1099-A  also  noted  that  Applicant  was  personally
liable for repayment of the debt, Applicant did not have a deficiency balance on his Bank
5 TH mortgage. Bank 5 also provided him with a substitute Form 1099-A in May 2015 for
Condo 3 mortgage, reflecting a $94,251 fair market value of his property and a $114,775
balance of outstanding principal. The substitute Form 1099-A also noted that Applicant
was personally liable for repayment of the debt, and Applicant had a $20,524 deficiency
balance on his Bank 5 Condo 3 mortgage. (Tr. 2 at 24-30, 53, 63-68; GE 2, 3, 4, 5; AE
G, K, L)
Applicant testified that he did not know anything about the mortgage with Mortgage
Servicer 3, placed for collection by Debt Collector (SOR ¶ 1.i). He stated that this debt
was not reported on his 2021 credit bureau report. He testified that he spoke with Debt
Collector and the creditor identified an account number, an outstanding balance, and a
potential payment arrangement; however, the creditor could not identify which property
was  associated  with  this  loan  or  provide  an  accounting  to  substantiate  the  reported
outstanding balance. (Tr. 2 at 31-33, 47, 65-68, 78-80; GE 2, 3, 4; AE G)
As of the  date  of the  DCS  VTC hearing,  Applicant  earned  $70,000  annually.  He
moved  to  state  C for a  lower cost of  living, where  he  pays  $750  monthly  in rent.  He testified
that  he  is current on  his expenses, to  include  his car  loan  and  four  credit cards,  and  he
attempts  to   live   by   a   budget.   He  testified   that  he   has  approximately   $600,000   in  his
retirement  accounts.  He  testified  that  with  his  tax  preparer’s  help, since  1988,  he  is current
on  his federal and  state  income  tax filings,  and  he  does not have  any  outstanding  taxes.
He testified  that his 2021  credit bureau  report did not report any  of  the  SOR debts,  he
worked  hard to  get his  credit in good  standing, and he  had  a credit rating  of  700  to  730.
He received  financial counseling  in June  2021.  He stated  that he  no  longer owned  any
investment  properties, as he  learned  his lesson. He  believed  that his mistakes  of  the  past
should not be  held against  him.  He traveled  to  Canada  for pleasure four times in 2016
and  again in 2018.  Letters of  support from  a  lifelong  friend, his team  lead, several co-
workers,  and   his  pastor  attested   to   Applicant’s  professionalism,  reliability,  and
trustworthiness. (Tr.  2  at  16, 22-23, 31-32, 48, 50, 52, 54, 69-74, 80,  85-86; GE  1, 2; AE
