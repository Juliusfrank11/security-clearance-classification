The  SOR  alleges  that,  as  of  September 21,  2021,  Applicant owed  student-loan
debts in collection for $25,616 (SOR  ¶ 1.a) and $9,143  (SOR ¶ 1.b); a Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) debt of $379 in collection (SOR ¶ 1.c); a satellite-television service
debt of $32 in collection (SOR ¶ 1.e); a cellular-phone debt of $282 in collection (SOR ¶
1.f); and four medical debts of $151 (SOR ¶ 1.d), $165 (SOR ¶ 1.g), $774 (SOR ¶ 1.h), and
$262 (SOR ¶ 1.i) in collection. (Item 1.) When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted
the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.h, but then disputed the validity of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e
and the accuracy of the amount in SOR ¶ 1.f. He did not respond to SOR ¶ 1.i, which may
have been missed as it was alleged out of alphabetical order.  He explained he had no
success in getting his health insurer to cover the medical debts that were incurred when he
was shot during an armed robbery, and he had mistakenly thought that his student loans
were deferred when he began graduate school classes online. (Item 2.) After considering
Items 1 through 7, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 39 years old. He and his ex-wife divorced in February 2014 after eight
years of marriage. Their two children, a daughter age 14 and son age 12, live with his ex-
wife. As of October 2017, Applicant had been in a cohabitant relationship since June 2013.
(Item 3.)
Applicant  has  a  bachelor’s  degree  earned  in  May  2007.  He  was  enrolled  in  a
university for one semester before pursuing a graduate degree online in 2019.  It is not
clear  in  the  record  how  long  he  pursued  his  studies  online.  He  was  not  pursuing  any
studies in October 2021, although he planned on resuming his graduate studies online in
January  2022.  (Items  2,  3.)  Applicant  started  working  as  an  analyst  on  a  government
contract with his current employer, an auditing firm, in February 2016. He was out of work
while  the  contract  was  being renewed  from  July 2016  until September 2016, when he
resumed his employment with the company. (Item 3.)
Applicant served honorably in the Army National Guard (ARNG) from November
2004 to October 2013. He was granted a Secret clearance in approximately October 2005.
He was in the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) in college, and was commissioned
as an officer on his college graduation. (Item 3.) In February 2010, at the rank of captain,
he  was  activated  for  a  full-time  position  as  a  program  manager  with  the  ARNG.  He
remained on active duty orders for an overseas deployment from August 2012 to June
2013. On his return, he worked from home full time doing manpower studies and analysis
for a data solutions company on a government contract. He lost that job in September
2015 when the contract was not renewed. He was unemployed until November 2015. He
had  some  temporary  work  from  November  2015  until  July  2016,  when  that  work  was
outsourced overseas. It appears that he had two sources of income from February 2016,
when he first started with his current employer, until July 2016, when he lost both jobs.
(Item 3.)
On October 30, 2017, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86) for his current employer. In response to an SF 86 inquiry concerning any
delinquency involving routine accounts, Applicant listed four debts: an $800 credit-card
debt that he resolved in September 2016; medical bills totaling $9,000 incurred because he
was shot while being robbed in April 2015; a disputed $282 cellular-phone debt (SOR ¶ 1.f)
in collection that he claimed was resolved in May 2015 when he closed his account; and
student loans totaling $28,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b). He explained that he would be re-
enrolling in school that next semester and planned “to request deferment while in school.”
(Item 3.)
One or more of Applicant’s credit reports from November 18, 2017 (Item 7), May
16, 2019 (Item 6), and March 23, 2020 (Item 5) showed that Applicant defaulted on the
following accounts.
SOR ¶ 1.a — $25,616
In August 2001, Applicant obtained a student loan for $18,585. In April 2010, the
loan  had  a  balance  of  $26,596.  The  loan  was  rated  as  current  until  April  2017.  As  of
October 2017, the loan account was 180 days past due for $2,233 with a total balance of
$29,007. (Items 6-7.) As of April 2019, the loan was in collections for $25,313. (Item 6.)
The loan reportedly had a delinquent balance of $25,616 as of February 2020. (Item 5.)
Applicant explained during an August 9, 2018 personnel subject interview (PSI) with
an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that he had to
continue to apply for hardship deferments of his student loans. He explained that he initially
neglected  his  student  loans  due  to  lack  of  income.  He  indicated  that  his  medical  bills
became his focus after he was injured while being robbed in April 2015. He admitted that
he received a letter from a collections entity about the student-loan debts in approximately
2017. He asserted that he had recently set up an online account with the Department of
Education to establish a repayment plan, and he was hoping to pay about $100 to $200 a
month toward his student loans. Applicant stated that since medical bills were no longer a
concern, he could focus on his student loans to bring them current. Applicant estimated
that he owed about $42,000 in total student-loan debts. (Item 4.)
SOR ¶ 1.b — $9,143
In September 2006, Applicant obtained a student loan for $7,339. The loan was
deferred for a time. As of October 2017, Applicant was $1,114 past due on a student loan
with  a  $12,447  balance.  (Item  7.)  As  of  February  2020,  Applicant  reportedly  owed  a
delinquent student-loan balance of $9,143. (Item 5.)
With  respect  to  the  student  loans  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b,  Applicant  stated  in
response to the SOR in October 2021 that he had been making monthly payments of $100
in  2019  until  he  began  graduate school online and assumed he did not have to make
payments on the loans. He apparently suspended his studies for a time, as he stated that
he would be re-enrolling at the university starting in January 2022 and would “work to get
this fixed.” (Item 2.)
SOR ¶ 1.c — $379
In September 2019, the VA placed a $379 debt for collection. As of February 2020,
the debt was unpaid. (Item 5.) Applicant explained in response to the SOR that he had
dropped an online class in graduate school when his father was placed in hospice care,
although he did not specify when that occurred. Applicant took off a semester and then re-
enrolled in graduate school. He mistakenly thought that the VA had withdrawn the funds for
the debt from his GI benefits. He admitted his error and indicated that he could work with
the VA to resolve the debt. (Item 2.)
SOR ¶ 1.d — $151
In November 2018, a $151 medical debt  was placed for collection. As of March
2020, the debt had not been paid. (Item 5.)
SOR ¶ 1.e — $32
In July 2017, a satellite-television company placed a $31 debt for collection. As of
November 2017, the collection entity was reporting a $32 balance. (Item 7.) During his
August 2018 PSI, Applicant stated that he had satellite-television service in 2014, but he
cancelled  the  account  when  he  moved.  He  asserted  that  he  was  never  notified  of  an
unpaid balance on the account. He indicated that he would inquire about the debt, and
resolve any valid balance. (Item 4.) In October 2021, Applicant expressed his belief the
debt was not valid as he had closed out his account and was unaware of any balance.
(Item 2.)
SOR ¶ 1.f — $282
In  March  2017,  a  collection  entity  acquired  a  $282  cellular-phone  debt.  As  of
October 2017, the debt was unpaid. (Items 3, 7.) Applicant explained during his August
2018 PSI that he thought the matter was closed after he told the collection entity that he
was not under contract with the cellular-phone company when the debt was reportedly
incurred. He explained that he would attempt to verify the debt and pay it in full within a
month if it was shown to be valid. (Item 4.) In his October 2021 response to the SOR,
Applicant indicated that he had closed the account after he returned from his deployment in
2013 and that he had “requested previously that this [debt] be removed from [his] credit
report.” (Item 2.)
SOR ¶ 1.g — $165
In May 2016, a $160 medical debt was placed for collection. As of October 2017,
the account had an unpaid balance of $165. (Item 7.) When asked about this debt and the
medical  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.h  and  1.i  during  his  August  2018  PSI,  Applicant  did  not
recognize the collection entities, but surmised that the medical debts in collections stem
from his medical care after being victimized in a robbery. (Item 4.)
SOR ¶ 1.h — $774
A medical debt was in collection for $774 as of October 2017. (Item 7.) There is no
evidence that debt has been paid.
SOR ¶ 1.i — $262
In March 2016, a collection entity acquired a $262 medical debt. As of May 2019,
the debt was unpaid. (Items 6-7.)
Applicant was shot while being robbed in April 2015. Because his wallet was stolen,
he did not have his medical insurance card to produce at the hospital, but he was able to
provide his medical insurance information. He explained on his October 2017 SF 86 about
the  listed  $9,000  in  medical  delinquencies,  which  he  subsequently  asserted  without
corroboration includes the  medical debts alleged in the  SOR, that the creditor hospital
“refused to look [him] up via [his] SSN and personal info,” and  billed him directly for the
medical charges. Thinking that his medical insurance would cover them, he ignored the
medical bills. In approximately September 2017, the state began garnishing his paycheck
at $260 per month. He then started working with the state’s crime victims advocate office,
and reportedly received assurances by the time of his August 2018 PSI that the medical
bills would be paid and that he would be reimbursed for his wages garnished. (Items 3-4.)
In response to the SOR, Applicant stated that he had tried unsuccessfully to resolve the
medical debts with his health insurance provider. (Item 2.)
During his August 2018 PSI, Applicant described his financial situation as good. He
indicated that payment of his medical expenses by the crime victims advocate office would
free up $260 of his income each month, and he would be reimbursed for the wages that
had been garnished for his medical debts. Additionally, he expected his financial situation
to improve as his cohabitant girlfriend had just completed her master’s degree and was
seeking employment. Applicant expressed his belief that he would be able to rectify his
outstanding delinquencies, assuming he could repay his student loans monthly in small
increments. (Item 4.)
Applicant  presented  no  documentation  of  any  efforts  to  pay,  settle,  otherwise
resolve, or dispute the debts in the SOR, even though he had an opportunity to update the
evidentiary record in response to the FORM. He provided no information about his current
income or expenses, including about any child support payments to his ex-wife. In addition
to the delinquent student loans, VA debt, and the $151 medical collection debt, Applicant’s
March  2020  credit  report  showed  that  he  owed  an  outstanding  credit-card  balance  of
$10,783 on an account closed by the credit grantor. The account had been ninety days
delinquent from February 2019 to April 2019, although Applicant was making payments on
the account. Applicant was current in his payments on a credit-card account with a $2,585
balance. He made timely payments of $296 per month on an unsecured loan for $1,500
obtained in September 2018 and satisfied the loan in May 2019. He paid off a $31,041 car
loan in July 2019. His loan payments had been delinquent 30 days six times. (Item 5.)
