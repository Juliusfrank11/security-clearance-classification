The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  F  that,  as  of  November  27,  2020,  Applicant
owed collection debts of $199 (SOR ¶ 1.a), $150 (SOR ¶ 1.b), $884 (SOR ¶ 1.c), $12,995
(SOR  ¶  1.d,  student  loan),  $3,329  (SOR  ¶ 1.f,  student  loan),  $508  (SOR  ¶  1.g),  $293
(SOR ¶ 1.h), $258 (SOR ¶ 1.i), $195 (SOR ¶ 1.j), and $144 (SOR ¶ 1.k); and a charged-
off debt of $8,246 (SOR ¶ 1.e, car-loan deficiency). As amended, the SOR alleges under
Guideline B that Applicant’s father-in-law (SOR ¶ 2.b) and mother-in-law (SOR ¶ 2.c) are
resident citizens of Jordan.
When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, she admitted the collection debts
in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.b,  1.d,  and  1.f,  but  stated  that  they  have  been  paid.  She  denied  the
collection  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.h  based  on  payment;  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  for  lack  of
knowledge; the car-loan debt in SOR ¶ 1.e and an associated debt in SOR ¶ 1.g because
she had returned the vehicle to the dealership within two business days of purchase; and
the  collection  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.i-1.k  on  which  she  had  opened  dispute  inquiries.
Applicant acknowledged that her in-laws are resident citizens of Jordan, but she denied
any inference that she had divided allegiance.
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Financial
Applicant is 39 years old and married. She has a bachelor’s degree earned in May
2005. (GE 1.) Between August 2001 and March 2005, Applicant obtained several student
loans  to  pay  for  her  undergraduate  education.  One  or  more  of  the  credit  reports  in
evidence show that Applicant had four student loans totaling $17,250 (accounts starting
with #45) that had been transferred by Sallie Mae to the federal government, which was
reporting a balance of $19,676 as of July 2011. As of July 2011, Sallie Mae was holding
four other student loans in collection totaling $15,068 (accounts starting with #96). (GE
8.) When Applicant went to college, she did not fully understand the system with respect
to paying for her education. She did not apply for some scholarships for which she was
eligible (Tr. 41), and after paying on her student loans for about four years, she became
“frustrated”  with  the  lack  of  progress  in  lowering  the  principal  and  stopped  paying  the
loans. (Tr. 46.)
While Applicant was in college, she had an internship with a defense contractor
from November 2003 to September 2004. (GEs 3, 11.) After she graduated, she worked
for the defense contractor as a full-time employee for the next nine years. (GE 1.)
On July 27, 2011, Applicant completed and certified as accurate a Questionnaire
for National Security Positions (SF 86). She responded affirmatively to financial record
inquiries concerning whether, in the last seven years, she had defaulted on any loan; had
an account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay according
to  terms;  or  had  been  over  180  days  delinquent  on  any  debts;  and  whether  she  was
currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts. She listed a student-loan debt of $8,206
and a credit-card debt of $10,573, asserting that they were being repaid under established
repayment plans, and a delinquent car loan on which she owed $12,180 for which she
was attempting to arrange for repayment. (GE 3.)
As  of  August  23,  2011,  Applicant’s  credit  report  showed  that  she  had  closed
several  credit-card  accounts  after  repaying  the  debts  on  time  and  that  she  and  a  joint
owner had opened a credit-card account in July 2011 (balance $7,506). She reportedly
owed two medical debts in collection for $106 and $418; credit-card collection debts of
$4,290, $10,373, and $6,199; $12,180 on the car loan; student-loan collection balances
of $7,946, $2,059, $2,664, and $2,322; and a charged-off credit-card debt of $6,901. The
federal  government  was  owed  $19,676  in  additional  student-loan  debts  that  were  in
deferment after being seriously past due from September 2010 through May 2011. (GE
8.)
On September 8, 2011, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator
for  the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  She  explained  that  her  Sallie  Mae
student loans totaled $14,900 and that she started repaying them in late July 2011 when
she made a payment of $600. She explained that she arranged to have $300 a month
withdrawn from her bank account for the debt.  She reported that she also  owed direct
federal  student  loans  of  $19,700,  which  she  started  repaying  at  $100  a  month  in  July
2011. She stated that those loans would be paid off in 2025. (GE 11.) Applicant admitted
at her hearing that she did not follow through with those plans. (Tr. 53.) Applicant told the
investigator that she settled the delinquent car loan for $6,090 and made her first monthly
payment of $200 in August 2011. As for the $10,373 credit-card delinquency, Applicant
stated had made payments of $200 in July 2011 and $500 in August 2011, and would
pay $500  in  September 2011  and  $366  in October 2011  with  $366  monthly payments
thereafter.  Applicant  had  not  contacted  her  creditors  to  whom  she  owed  $4,290  and
$6,199, as she was waiting until she had reduced the balances of the accounts on which
she was making payments. (GE 11.)
During her interview,  Applicant attributed her delinquencies to being young and
irresponsible with her money. She had allowed her then boyfriend and her sister to live
with her, and she supported them because they were unemployed. Applicant also gave
her mother $2,000 a month in financial support. Applicant stated that she could meet her
financial obligations because she was no longer supporting her mother, her sister, or her
former boyfriend. Applicant explained that she had paid $6,000 to a debt-settlement firm
for  assistance  in  resolving  her  debts,  but  when  she  saw  no  progress,  she  decided  to
arrange payment plans on her own. (GE 11.)
In July 2014, following her mother’s death, Applicant resigned from her job of nine
years. She decided to take some time off from working and was unemployed until May
2015. From May 2015 to November 2015, Applicant worked for a technology company
as a design engineer. (GE 1.) Wanting a more stable work environment, Applicant took a
job with a contractor on a federal installation.  On December 3, 2015, she completed a
Declaration for Federal Employment on which she answered “Yes” to whether she was
delinquent  on  any  federal  debt.  She  listed  three  delinquent  student  loans:  $3,835  and
$14,922, which were late as of May 2013, and $19,752, which was late as of April 2012.
She  added  that  she  was  scheduled  to  meet  with  a  financial  advisor  to  establish  a
repayment plan to pay off her student loans within five years. (GE 2.) Applicant did not
show for her appointment with the financial advisor. (Tr. 54.) She could not explain why
she failed to address her student loans when she had been diligent about cleaning up her
credit in other areas. (Tr. 54-55.)
In January 2017, Applicant quit her job and moved back to the state where she
was raised. She had been required to make presentations to large groups of people, and
it caused her anxiety. (GE 1.) Applicant worked as a substitute teacher from  April 2017
until  November  2017,  when  she  decided  to  return  to  engineering  full  time.  From
November 2017 to November 2018, she worked for a company that supports her current
employer.  In  November  2018,  she  accepted  a  full-time  position  with  her  employer,  a
laboratory that has DOD contracts. (GE 1.)
On December 11, 2018, Applicant completed and certified as accurate an SF 86
for her current background investigation. In response to an inquiry into whether she was
currently delinquent on any federal debt, she listed a $14,659 student loan and stated, “I
worked to pay off other outstanding debt for [the] last 10 years and was also until recently
helping  immediate  family  members  financially.  I  will  re-start  payment  of  this  loan  in
January   2019.” She   responded   “No”  to   inquiries  concerning   any   delinquency   involving
routine  accounts. (GE  1.)
Applicant’s  credit  report  of  January  10,  2019,  showed  two  student  loans  in
collection for $12,995 (SOR ¶ 1.d) and $3,329 (SOR ¶ 1.f). Those loans, which had been
placed with the U.S. government in November 2009, appear to be the loans once held by
Sallie Mae (account #96). Additionally, an automobile loan obtained in August 2012 for
$23,768 had been charged off for $6,819 in May 2013 after she stopped making her $646
monthly payments. As of  November 2018, the  creditor was claiming a debt balance of
$8,246 (SOR ¶ 1.e). Several debts were in collection status: $884 from April 2014 (SOR
¶ 1.c); $508 assigned in August 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.g); $293 owed since November 2017 to
a cable services provider (SOR ¶ 1.h); $258 on a cell phone account since October 2015
(SOR  ¶  1.i); $199 for insurance  assigned  in August  2017  (SOR ¶ 1.a); $195 on a  cell
phone  account  since  November  2015  (SOR  ¶  1.j);  $150  for  medical  services  from
September 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.b); and $144 on an account assigned in June 2016 (SOR ¶
1.k). (GE 7.)
During an interview with an OPM investigator on February 21, 2019, Applicant was
given five days to provide information about the delinquencies on her credit report that
she did not list on her SF 86. When re-interviewed on February 27, 2019, Applicant did
not recognize the $144 collection debt (SOR ¶ 1.k) or the $150 medical debt (SOR ¶ 1.b).
She acknowledged the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i-1.k. As for the cable-services debt in SOR ¶
1.h, Applicant explained that when she had her cable service disconnected, she was told
there was no balance due. Regarding the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g for $508, Applicant explained
that it was a credit-card balance that kept accruing after her automatic payments stopped.
She believed the $884 collection debt (SOR ¶ 1.c) was on a closed cell phone account.
Her new cell phone provider promised to pay off the debt and then did not pay it. About
her  federal  student  loans,  Applicant  stated  that  she  was  trying  to  consolidate  them.
Regarding the car-loan delinquency (SOR ¶ 1.e), Applicant stated that she made her loan
payments until 2013. She tried several times to return the vehicle to the dealer who would
not accept it, so she eventually just left the vehicle at the dealership. (GE 10.)
On February 22, 2019, a collection entity agreed to settle some $13,736 in student-
loan debts balances on four accounts (accounts starting #96) on receipt of a lump-sum
payment  of  $2,128  by  February 27,  2019.  (AE  D.)  Applicant  contacted  her  creditor on
December 1, 2021, and she was told that she owed the $2,128. The creditor was looking
into the debt and remains willing to accept the $2,128 in settlement if she did not already
pay it. (Tr. 51.) Applicant testified that the settlement may be for the federal student loans
in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.f, but she was not certain. (Tr. 39, 50.)
As  of  March  13,  2020,  the  collection  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c  were  still  on
Applicant’s  credit  report  as  unresolved.  Two  loans  held  by  the  U.S.  Department  of
Education, of $19,752 (likely the direct loans) and $14,922 (likely the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d
and 1.f) were listed as having zero balances after transfer. The other SOR debts were not
on her credit report with Equifax Mortgage Solutions. (GE 6.) Around early August 2020,
Applicant made a final payment settling her cable services debt (SOR ¶ 1.h) for $190.
(AE A.) The collection debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b were still on her credit report as of October
15, 2020. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.c had been dropped from her credit report. (GE 5.)
Applicant was not proactive about resolving her debts because they were no longer
on  her credit  report.  They  were  not  affecting  her day-to-day  life.  (Tr.  68-69.)  Applicant
indicated in response to the SOR on December 2, 2020, that she had paid the debts in
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.h. She provided documentation showing that the cable-services
debt in SOR ¶ 1.h had been settled on August 4, 2020. (AE A.) The $199 insurance debt
(SOR ¶ 1.a) was credited to her account and considered paid as of December 21, 2020.
(AE B.) The $150 medical debt (SOR ¶ 1.b) had also been paid in full (AE F; Tr. 34-35),
although the record from the creditor does not reflect the date of payment. Similarly, the
collection entities holding the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k confirmed that those debts
had  been  paid,  but  the  dates  of  debt  satisfaction  are  not  in  evidence.  (AEs  H-J.)  The
collection entity holding the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c agreed to settle the $884 balance for a
lump-sum  payment  of  $353  on  December  13,  2021.  (AE  G.)  Applicant  indicated  in  an
email  that  the  debt  has  been  paid  and  account  closed,  although  she  provided  no
documentary proof of the payment to settle that debt.
On  December 1, 2021,  Applicant expressed her intent to  repay  her outstanding
student loans. (Tr. 43.) Applicant owes direct student loans (reported balance of $19,725,
accounts  starting  #45).  She  had  no  plan  established  to  resolve  the  debt.  (GEs  6,  11.)
When  asked  at  her  hearing  about  her  plan  to  resolve  that  student-loan  debt  still
outstanding, Applicant responded:
So what I’m worried about is this is going to be a repeat of history and I’m
going to have all the conviction in the world at this exact moment [and] it’s
all going to dissipate when I walk away. But my plan is what it’s always been
that I’m going to contact, you know, the people — whoever they sold it off
to  and I’m  going to  ask them  what the balance  is. And I’m either going to
ask for a smaller payoff or — that’s my plan like right this second and that’s
what I should do. (Tr. 77.)
Applicant has made no effort to contact her creditors about the car-loan charged
off for $6,819 (SOR ¶ 1.e) or the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e, which she believes is associated with
the car purchase. (Tr. 62.) She testified that she only drove the vehicle for two days before
she realized that it was not a reasonable vehicle for her. (Tr. 43.) She does not intend to
repay it because she believes she was persuaded to purchase a car that was too big, and
she did not want. (Tr. 60-61.) She believes the dealer should not hold her to the loan’s
terms. (Tr. 61.)
Applicant had zero balances on all of her open accounts as of December 2021.
(AE  E.)  Her  current  take-home  pay  for  two  weeks  of  work  is  $3,589.  Her  spouse  is  a
student at a local community college and is unemployed. (Tr. 63-64.) They have a son
who  attends  daycare  at  $600  a  week,  and  Applicant  is  expecting  their  second  child.
Applicant’s other monthly  expenses include  rent at $2,150, around  $200  for electricity,
$50 for gas heat, $100 for the Internet, and $180 for cell phones. Applicant has had some
unexpected expenses, including a $6,000 medical bill for her son. (Tr. 64-66.) She has
$5,000 in her checking account and $60,000 in savings. (Tr. 67.) Applicant testified that
she is “terrified” of not having enough money to cover her expenses. (Tr. 68.)
Foreign Influence
Applicant is a U.S. citizen from birth. Her parents immigrated to the United States
and became U.S. citizens by naturalization. They were both deceased by December 2018
when  Applicant  applied  for  security  clearance  eligibility.  Applicant  is  the  fourth  of  six
children.  Her  sister  and  the  eldest  of  her  four  brothers  acquired  U.S.  citizenship  by
naturalization. Two of her brothers are U.S. citizens from birth. Her siblings reside in the
United States. (GE 1; Answer.)
Applicant  traveled  to  Jordan  to  meet  her  future  in-laws  from  July  14,  2016,  to
August 1, 2016. She returned to Jordan from July 27, 2017, to August 10, 2017, for her
wedding to her spouse, a Jordanian citizen. Under Applicant’s sponsorship,  Applicant’s
spouse immigrated to the United States and is a U.S. permanent resident. (GEs 1, 10.)
The circumstances of their meeting and courtship are not in evidence. Applicant’s spouse
is currently a student at a local community college. (GE 10; Tr. 64.) During a February 21,
2019  interview  by  an  authorized  investigator  for  the  OPM,  Applicant  stated  that  her
spouse came to the United States in 2017 after their marriage, and that he came to the
United States for better opportunities and a chance to study. (GE 10.)
Applicant’s parents-in-law are resident citizens of Jordan. (GE 1; Tr. 70.)  Applicant
has had in-person contact with her parents-in-law only in Jordan, when she went there to
meet them and then for her wedding. (GE 10.) Applicant indicated on her December 2018
SF  86  (GE  1)  and  during  her  February  2019  interview  (GE  10)  that  she  had  weekly
telephone  contact  with  her in-laws.  Applicant’s  spouse  currently  calls his parents  on  a
daily basis. Applicant exchanges only a brief greeting with her in-laws to be respectful.
Approximately  once  a  month  and  on  special  occasions,  such  as  birthdays,  Applicant
converses with her in-laws. (Tr. 70-71, 74.) Her parents-in-law do not know that she is
under consideration for security clearance eligibility. (GE 10.)
Applicant’s father-in-law has been blind since he was five years old. (Tr. 44.) He is
retired from his job with the government of Jordan as a phone operator at a blood bank.
(GEs 1, 10; Tr. 73.) Applicant’s mother-in-law has never worked outside her home. (GEs
1, 10; Tr. 44, 70.) Applicant and her spouse provide his parents about $2,400 a year in
financial support to cover medical and living expenses. (GEs 1, 10; Tr. 71.) His parents
own their home in Jordan. (Tr. 74.) They live an area in Jordan that is currently subject to
a Level 4 – Do Not Travel warning from the U.S. State Department due to terrorism and
crime.  Applicant’s spouse  has three  siblings: a  brother in Jordan  and  two  sisters who
reside in the United States. (Tr. 74-75.) No information was provided about his siblings’
occupations or activities.
During  her  February  27,  2019  interview,  Applicant  was  asked  by  the  OPM
investigator whether anyone would have reason for concern on viewing her social media
account.  Applicant  described  herself  as an activist  for human  rights  and  indicated that
some might view her opinions concerning the Palestinian situation as extreme or drastic
as  she  is  concerned  about  the  violence  in  the  Middle  East.  (GE  10.)  At  her  hearing,
Applicant  admitted  that  she  had  posted  statements  that  someone  might  think
controversial. (Tr. 76.) There is no evidence that she has ever acted on her opinions.
Administrative Notice
Administrative notice is not taken of the source documents in their entirety, but of
specific  facts  properly  noticed  and  relevant  and  material  to  the  issues.  I  take
administrative notice of the facts requested by the Government in HE I and of other facts
set forth in the source publications from the U.S. State Department, including the updated
travel advisory and the bilateral relations fact sheet.
Jordan’s form of government is a constitutional monarchy ruled by a king who has
ultimate  executive  and  legislative  authority.  The  United  States  has  a  long  history  of
cooperation and friendship with Jordan, and appreciates the leadership role Jordan plays
in  advancing  peace  and  moderation  in  the  region.  The  two  countries  both  seek  a
comprehensive, just, and lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and an end
to the violent extremism that threatens the security of Jordan, the region, and the world.
Based  on  shared  strategic  goals  and  a  close  working  relationship,  in  1996  the  United
States designated Jordan as a U.S. major non-NATO ally. The United States is Jordan’s
single largest provider of bilateral assistance, providing more than $1.2 billion in 2020.
Development assistance programs reinforce the United States’ commitment to broaden
cooperation and dialogue with a stable, reform-oriented Jordan. The two countries have
had a Free Trade Agreement in place since 2000, which has helped to diversity Jordan’s
economy and increased bilateral trade between the countries by over 800 percent over
the last 20 years. A strong U.S. military assistance program is designed to meet Jordan’s
legitimate defense needs, including preservation of border integrity and regional stability
through providing materiel and training.
Jordan remains at high risk for terrorism. Local, regional, and transnational groups
and  extremists  have  demonstrated  a  willingness  and  capacity  to  plan  and  executed
attacks  in  Jordan,  a  key  U.S.  ally  in  combating  terrorism  and  extremist  ideology.  The
current travel advisory from the U.S. State Department is Level 4 – Do Not Travel due to
COVID-19.  Travelers  are  advised  to  exercise  increased  caution  in  Jordan  due  to
terrorism.  The  State  Department  issued  a  Level  4  –  Do  Not  Travel  warning  within  3.5
miles  of  Jordan’s  border  with  Syria  due  to  terrorism  and  armed  conflict;  to  designated
Syrian refugee camps in Jordan due to government restrictions; and to Zarqa, Rusayfah,
and  the  Baqa’a  neighborhood  of  Ayn  Basha  due  to  terrorism  and  crime.  All  U.S.
government personnel on official travel to Zarqa, Rusayfah, and the Baqa’a neighborhood
must be in daylight areas only. Personal travel by U.S. government personnel to these
cities is not authorized. The U.S. State Department’s annual crime and safety report for
Jordan issued on May 1, 2020, reported that the U.S. involvement in Iraq and Syria and
the U.S. government’s policies regarding Israel led more than 80% of Jordanians to hold
an unfavorable opinion of the U.S. government, although the anti-Western sentiment did
not extend to U.S. citizens or culture generally.
Civilian  authorities  in Jordan maintained  effective  control over security forces  in
2020.  Yet,  significant  human  rights  issues  in  Jordan  included  cruel,  inhuman,  and
degrading treatment or punishment; arbitrary arrest and detention, including of activists
and  journalists;  infringements  on  citizens’  privacy  rights;  serious  restrictions  on  free
expression  and  the  press,  including  censorship  and  Internet-site  blocking;  substantial
restrictions on freedoms of assembly and association; official corruption; “honor” killings
of  women; trafficking in persons; and gender violence. Impunity remained widespread,
although  the  Jordanian  government  took  some  limited  steps  to  investigate,  prosecute,
and  punish  officials  who  committed  abuses.  There  is  no  indication  that  the  Jordanian
government used any coercive methods on its resident citizens to obtain U.S. sensitive
information  or  that  the  Jordanian  government  targeted  the  United  States  for  such
information.
