Drug  Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d allege, and Applicant admitted that he purchased and
used  marijuana  and/or  THC-infused  CBD  edibles  with  varying  frequency  from  about
August  2010  to  about  March  2019.  This  includes  marijuana  use  while  a  federal
government employee from August 2010 to August 2012.
Applicant used marijuana from about 1997 until 2020. (Tr. 18, 21) When he was in
college, he smoked marijuana on about a weekly basis. (Tr. 18-19) He usually purchased
the  marijuana  he  used.  (Tr.  19)  In  August  2010,  he  began  his  federal  government
employment. (Tr. 20) In 2020, he reduced his marijuana use to about once a month. (Tr.
21)   There  was  no   evidence   presented   of   the   sensitivity   of   his  federal  government
employment.
Applicant  did  not  possess  or  use  marijuana  from  early  2010  until  around  2011
because of  his federal government employment. (Tr. 22, 24) He learned there  was  no
drug  testing  at  his  federal  government  employment,  and  he  decided  to  resume  his
marijuana possession and use. (Tr. 23) He worked for a university from September 2012
to February of 2016. (Tr. 23) At his hearing, he claimed that in late 2011 or early 2012,
he stopped using marijuana again because he was looking for new employment, and he
did not possess and use marijuana until late 2015 or early 2016. (Tr. 23-26)
In July 2017, Applicant started his current employment, and since early 2018, he
has  been  eating  THC-infused  CBD  edibles,  which  he  purchased  from  marijuana
dispensaries.  (Tr.  27)  His  most  recent  use  of  a  THC-infused  CBD  was  in  August  or
September 2020. (Tr. 33-34, 43; SOR response at 2) He is aware that the THC content
of  the  CBD  gummies  he  consumes  exceeds  the  Department  of  Agriculture  authorized
level  for  hemp  products  of  .3  percent.  (Tr.  28-29,  49)  As  such,  his  possession  and
consumption  of  his THC-infused  CBD  gummies  violated  federal  restrictions.  See  Joint

SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  and  Applicant  admitted  that  he  used  a  prescription  opioid
without  a  prescription  in  August  2019.  He  used  his  spouse’s  prescription  opioid  twice
when he had a painful molar and a painful knee. (Tr. 35)
As to his history of illegal drug use, Applicant said in a written statement submitted
at his hearing:
Simply   put,   since   my   professional  career  started   in   2006,  I  have   never
allowed  drug  use  to  be  a  limiting  factor in my  employability  or professional
advancement.  If  I’m  unable to  use  due  to  my  employment status or (as of
late)  if   I  cannot  acquire   recreational  CBD  or  THC   products  from   a   state-
sanctioned  dispensary, I simply refrain  from  using.  (AE A)
As for his future use of illegal drugs, Applicant said:
So  I'm  [an]  adult now  with  a  kid  and  a  mortgage. I don’t  need  to  use  CBD
products  or  anything  really, and  I  haven’t.  Once  again,  it’s not  a  big  deal.
And  if  it’s going  to  affect my  employment,  I  can’t risk even  5  percent of  my
job  and  my  son  and  my  mortgage  and  everything. I’m  risk averse and  I can’t.
(Tr. 48)
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶¶ 2.a through 2.d allege Applicant failed to fully disclose on his March 17,
2019  SCA  the  information  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.e  concerning  his  marijuana
possession and use, his consumption of THC-infused CBD gummies, and his abuse of a
prescription opioid. He indicated on his SCA that he used marijuana; however, he limited
his  marijuana  use  to  states  where  marijuana  use  was  legal.  In  fact,  he  resided  in  and
possessed marijuana in several states where possession of marijuana was not legalized
under state law at the time he possessed it.
At his hearing, Applicant said his objective when he completed his 2019 SCA was
to disclose he was limiting his marijuana use to places where it was legal under state law.
(Tr. 36-37) He said “if [he] could get it legally at low risk, [he] will, and [he] will use edible
typically high CBD, low THC. (Tr. 37) He said he did not have “vivid memories of using
regularly.” (Tr. 40) When he answered the question on his SCA about drug use, he may
have  been  downplaying  his  drug  use.  (Tr.  46)  He  conceded  that  sometimes  he  used
marijuana outside these “limited parameters.” (SOR response at 2)
Applicant disclosed for the first time during his August 26, 2019 Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) interview that he used his spouse’s opioid prescription twice to treat
his painful tooth and knee. He indicated he wanted to be fully transparent about his opioid
use. (Tr. 35-37; GE 3)
SOR ¶ 2.e alleges Applicant failed to disclose on his September 7, 2010 SCA the
information  in  SOR  ¶¶ 1.a,  1.b,  and  1.c about  his marijuana  and/or THC-infused  CBD
use.  In  2010,  Applicant  was  applying  for  federal  government  employment.  He  said  he
intentionally answered no to the questions about marijuana possession and use during
the  previous seven  years because  he  “wanted  to  ensure  [he] received  the  job”  and  he
wanted to “ensure [his] employability.” (Tr. 22; AE A at 1) However, in his SOR response,
he claimed the omission of his marijuana involvement was unintentional and an oversight.
(SOR response at 3)
SOR ¶ 2.f cross alleges the drug involvement in SOR ¶ 1.b while he was a federal
government employee as a personal conduct security concern.
During his August 26, 2019 OPM interview, Applicant said he smoked marijuana
three or four times a week when he was in college from 1998 to 2003. (GE 1 at 12-13;
GE 3 at 7) He used marijuana once a week from 2008  to 2010 while he was attending
the university where he received his master’s degree. (GE 1 at 13; GE 3 at 7) From 2012
to  2015,  while  employed  at  another  university,  he  used  marijuana  on  a  weekly  basis,
mostly at home. (GE 1 at 14; GE 3 at 7) From 2016 to 2017, he used marijuana two or
three times a week. (GE 1 at 9-10; GE 3 at 7)
From 2017 to 2019, Applicant used marijuana once or twice a week. (GE 1 at 9;
GE 3 at 7) He reduced the frequency of his marijuana use from 2017 to 2019 because
the state where he was residing had not legalized the purchase of marijuana. (GE 3 at 7)
From  2017  to  2019,  he  purchased marijuana  in  the state  where he  lived from 2016 to
2017 because marijuana sales were legalized in that state. (Id.)
Applicant’s descriptions of his history of marijuana use during his OPM interview
indicated  significantly  more  extensive  marijuana  use  than  he described  at  his hearing.
(Tr. 29-30) At his hearing, he explained that at his OPM interview, he was trying to show
that he was candid and open, and he was not as careful about accuracy as during his
subsequent statement in response to the SOR and at his hearing. (Tr. 29-33)
Applicant’s employer positively described his contributions in four letters. (AE A at
8-11) He received bonuses from 2018 to 2020. (Id.)
