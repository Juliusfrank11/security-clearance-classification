The  SOR  identifies  six  allegations  under  Guideline  B  (foreign  influence).
Applicant  admitted  all  allegations.  He  noted  that  his  potential  inheritance  of  a  house
located  on  a  parcel  of  land  was  less  than  $400,000.  (SOR  1.f)  All  references  to  the
government  exhibits  shall  be  to  the  typed  page  numbers  that  are  in  the  upper  right
corner or at the bottom of the page.
Applicant,  40  years  old,  was  born  in  Iraq  in  1981.  He  received  his  Iraqi
high  school  diploma  in  July  2000,  and  an  electrician’s  certificate  that  allowed  him  to
avoid  compulsory  service  in  the  Iraqi  military.  (GE  1  at  13;  GE  2  at  4)  He  assumed
financial  responsibility  for  his  mother  and  two  sisters  after  his  father  died  in  a  train
accident in 2004. (Answer to SOR at 3) As shall be discussed below, from 2004 to late
2013,  Applicant  was  an  Iraqi  police  officer.  He  married  his  wife,  an  Iraqi  citizen,  in
2010. (GE 1 at 26) Their ceremony took place in Iraq.  They immigrated to the United
States after he received death threats in 2012. After his wife’s cousin,  an  Iraqi linguist
employed by the U.S. military, was assassinated by terrorists in September 2013, they
immigrated to the United  States  later in  the same month.  (GE 2 at 5)  Applicant’s  two
children,  seven  and  five  years  old,  were  born  in  the  United  States.  His  wife  is  also
pregnant. He and his wife became U.S. citizens in 2019. She has been employed by a
department store as a salesperson since 2017. (GE 1 at 30; Tr. 6, 16-21, 45)
Background
In 2003, the coalition forces began to hire Iraqis into linguist and police officer
positions.  A  commander  in  the  Iraqi  police  force,  recognizing  Applicant’s  language
skills, hired him and sent him to a neighboring middle eastern country for a six-month
training course at the country’s police academy. (Answer to SOR at 3; GE 2 at 1, 8; AE
B2)
For  the  first  five  years  of  employment  as  a  patrol  officer,  Applicant  went  on
patrols  with  United  States  Army  (USA),  helping  them  remove  improvised  explosive
devices (IEDs) from the roads. He also worked with them as a secondary linguist when
their  primary  linguist  was  absent.  (Tr.  32-33)  In  2008,  he  was  promoted  to  internal
affairs  of  the  Ministry of  Interior,  and  ultimately promoted  to  detective  in  that  division.
He was assigned to the director’s office where one of his responsibilities was to gather
and  marshal  documents  for  the  prime  minister’s  review.  In  addition  to  resigning  from
the ministry because of his wife’s cousin’s assassination, he resigned from the ministry
after  receiving  repeated  death  threats  in  2012  from  Iran  proxies  to  leave  his  position
because of his affiliation to the wrong religious faith. (Answer to SOR at 3; GE 2 at 4;
(Tr. 32-37)
Applicant  considered  his  collaborative  Iraqi  police  work  with  the  coalition
forces and his cousin’s assassination as two important factors that could qualify him for
refugee  status  to  increase  his  chances  of  immigrating  to  the  United  States.  So  he
applied for that status through the International Organization for Migration (IOM).  After
many  interviews  at  the  United  States  (U.S.)  Embassy  in  Iraq  in  2013,  Applicant’s
refugee status was approved, and he immigrated to United States in the same year. In
2014, he received U.S. permanent resident status. Applicant has not been back to Iraq
since 2013, and has no intention of  returning in the future.  (GE 3 at 5; GE 4 at 2; Tr.
36, 46)
Between  2013  and  March 2018, Applicant worked  in the  United  States at three
armed  security  positions and  was a  security  manager at a  reputable  department  store.
He was fired  from  one  of those  positions  for an  arrest made  without sufficient  probable
cause.   The   termination   does  not   tarnish   his  employment  history   because   he   was
immediately  hired  by  a  competitive  department store’s security  team. (GE 1  at 17; GE
3   at  5)  In   August  2018,  Applicant   established   a   military   supply   business  that  designs
and  sells clothing  and  accessories  to   police  and  military  personnel. (GE 2  at  2)  For a
period   of   time   in  2019   that  is  not  clear from   Applicant’s  testimony,  after  receiving   his
U.S. citizenship  in April 2019,  and  applying  for his current  linguist position, he  applied
for  another  linguist  position   and   received   an   interim   security   clearance.  Following
training,  he   was  sent  to   another  U.S.  state   for  supplemental  training   and   then   to   Iraq
under  a   six-month   contract.  However,  the   then-president  of   the   United   States
downsized   the   unit  Applicant  was  working   for,  and   he   was  sent  back  to   the   United
States   in   late   2019.  (Tr.  47-48)  Though   he   indicated   he   was  scheduled   to   begin
security  training  with  the  Department of  State  in  early  2020, there  is no  indication  from
the  record that his training  was initiated  or completed. Since  June  2020, Applicant  has
been  working  as a  security  officer for a federal agency.  (GE  1  at 15; GE  2  at 2, 3; GE  3
at 5;  Tr. 21; answer to SOR at 3-4)
SOR  1.a  –  Applicant’s  mother  is  69  years  old  and  has  three  children,  two
daughters and Applicant. She is a permanent U.S. resident, but still is an Iraqi citizen.
She  has  been  living  with  Applicant  for  the  past  four  months.  He  has  continued  to
provide  her  financial  support  since  2013,  both  in  Iraq  and  the  United  States.  She  is
retired  from  a  clerk’s  position  in  the  Iraqi  Ministry  of  Agriculture  where  she  worked
about  10  years.  Applicant  testified  that  she  receives  no  pension  because  she  did  not
work  there  15  years  and  did  not  have  three  children.  (Applicant  must  not  have  been
considered  one  of  her  children  because  of  his  immigration  to  the  United  States  in
2013.) She has cardiovascular problems. She intends to stay in this country. (GE 1 at
28; GE 2 at 14; GE 3 at 1; Tr. 22-24, 53-55)
SOR  1.b  –  Applicant’s  oldest  sister was  born  in Iraq  in  1986  and is 35 years
old.  Her  job  as  a  bookkeeper  at  a  courthouse  connects  her  to  a  branch  of  the  Iraqi
government.  She  is  not  affiliated  with  any  foreign  military  service.  Her  husband  is  a
financial analyst with the court. She has two children. Applicant talks with her every 10
days, exchanging pleasantries and making inquiries about the kids. She knows he is a
security  guard,  but  does  not  know  he  is  applying  for  a  security  clearance.  Applicant
offered to sponsor her U.S immigration. He saw this sister in 2013, the last time he was
in Iraq before he immigrated to the United States. (GE 1 at 25-27, 33-34, 56; GE 3 at 2;
Tr. 56-58)
SOR 1.c – Applicant’s younger sister was born in Iraq in 1989, and is 32 years
old. She moved to the United States in 2014 and became a permanent resident. She is
a  married-housewife  with  two  children.  She  never  had  any  affiliation  with  any
government  or  military.  All  her  family  members  are  now  U.S.  citizens.  Her  husband
sells  medical  insurance.  She  is  a  housewife  who  never  had  an  affiliation  with  any
foreign government or military. (GE 3 at 2; Tr. 29-30, 58-59)
SOR  1.d  –  Applicant  was  a  security  officer  in  Iraq  from  April  2004  to
September 2013. See discussion above. (GE 1 at 20-21; GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 5; GE 4 at
2; answer to SOR at 3; Tr. 32-37)
SOR  1.e   –   Applicant’s  friend,  an  Iraqi  resident  citizen,  joined   the   Iraqi
police   department   when   Applicant  did  in   2004.  They   completed   the   same   police
academy  training  program  after they  joined  the  police. He  has  not seen  his friend  since
he  left the  police  in 2013. Except for monthly  contact with  his friend, Applicant has no
contact  with   any   other  individuals  he   worked   with   in  the   Iraqi  police   force.  In   their
telephone   conversations,  the   topics  of   discussion   are   the   welfare   of   each   other  and
their  families.  Applicant loaned  his friend  $300  in January  2019. Applicant testified  that
at  his  request,   the   friend   returned   the   money   to   Applicant’s  mother  (SOR  1.a).  The
friend   does  not  know   that  Applicant  is  applying   for  a   security   clearance.  To   reduce
potential  security   concerns,   after   he   received   the   SOR   in  January   2021,  Applicant
discontinued  contact with  his friend  altogether.  (GE  2  at 14; GE  3  at 6; Tr. 36-41, 64-
68)
SOR  1.f  –  Before  immigrating  to  the  United  States  in  2013,  Applicant
contributed about $60,000 to help his mother purchase a house in Iraq. Her investment
in  the  house  came  from  a  monetary  inheritance  from  Applicant’s  father.  Applicant  is
eligible  to  inherit  twice  his  two  sisters’  share  of  the  house  that  had  an  approximate
value  of  $400,000  in April 2019. Based on his subjective  belief  in an overall negative
change  in  the  surrounding  neighborhood,  Applicant  surmised  that  the  value  of  the
house has reduced to about $150,000. He intended to use his property inheritance to
invest  in  his  clothing supply business and  a down  payment  toward  the  purchase of  a
house in the United States. As mentioned in the background discussion above, he has
no intention of returning to Iraq. The house is empty at the present time. (GE 2 at 15;
Tr. 42-46, 68-74, 76-77)
Other  than  the  house,  Applicant  has  no  other  financial  interests  in  Iraq.
Though he did not respond to inquiries regarding ownership of U.S. stock investments,
he did have a retirement account valued at about $10,000, but he used the money to
purchase a car. His wife has $6,000 in her savings account. Their combined checking
accounts  total  $5,000.  He  has  a  mental  budget  that  he  and  his  wife  apply  to  bills  as
they become due. Applicant voted in the last federal and gubernatorial election in 2021.
(Tr. 77-81)
Applicant’s  allegiance  and  loyalty  is  only  to  the  United  States.  He  believes
these  are  key  factors  in  protecting  his  family.  He  signed  an  unofficial  memorandum
renouncing Iraqi citizenship. (GE 2 at 14-16; Tr. 46-49)
Character Evidence
On  June  1,  2020,  the  employee  relations  department  of  one  of  Applicant’s
previous  Iraqi  employers,  indicated  by  letter  that  Applicant’s  employment  was  his
position was terminated as a result of a reduction. He was eligible for rehire. (AE B1)
A former senior law enforcement advisor indicated in letters of July 2020 and
January 2014,  that  he  was  assigned  to  head  of  police  recruitment  in  2004,  where  he
met  Applicant.  The  law  advisor  extoled  Applicant’s  work  ethic  and  his  practical
approach  to  getting  problems  solved.  He  believes  Applicant  warrants  a  security
position (AE B2, B6)
On October 24, 2019, one of the commanding officers of the coalition forces,
commended Applicant for his linguist services from July-November 2019. For the four-
month  period,  Applicant  helped  the  coalition  forces  reinstate  advisor  operations  in
northwest Iraq. The author of this recommendation stated that he would take Applicant
anywhere.  Applicant  received  a  certificate  of  appreciation  on  November  1,  2019.  (AE
B3, E1)
In  an  undated  endorsement,  another  linguist  reported  that  she  met
Applicant  in  2019.  She  observed  how he  strived  to  support the  USA  in  every way he
could.  He  always  performed  his  work  in  a  timely  fashion  and  would  voluntarily  make
himself available for jobs that other linguists declined. (AE B4)
In  an  undated  letter,  another linguist  indicated  he  worked  with  Applicant
for  an  unidentified  period  with  in  an  Iraqi  location.  Applicant  always  showed
professionalism  in  carrying  out  his  assignments.  His  positive  attitude  at  work  justified
his application for security clearance eligibility. (AE B5)
On  October  19,  2021,  Applicant  received  a  certificate  for  completing  a
supervision and management course. (AE E2)
Administrative Notice  –  Republic of Iraq
Iraq is a parliamentary republic that continues to evolve into a stable country.
The  outcome  of  the  2014  parliamentary  elections  met  international  standards  of  fair
elections  and  led  to  the  peaceful  transition  of  leadership  from  former  Prime  Minister
Nouri al-Maliki to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.
In  December  2019  because  of  the  constant  demand  for  changes  in  the  Iraq
political system, Prime Minister Adil Abd al-Mahdi resigned. A new prime minister was
confirmed by the Iraq cabinet in May 2020. He promised to improve security and fight
corruption.  Several  assassinations  later  in  2020  of  protest  leaders  and  a  well-known
researcher caused  serious  doubt  in whether the new prime minister would  be able to
accomplish his objective.
The U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens living in Iraq are at a high risk
for  kidnapping  and  terrorist  violence.  The  U.S.  Government  considers  the  potential
threats to U.S. government personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to
live and work under strict security guidelines.
A 2019 human rights report indicated that serious human rights problems are
still  widespread  in  Iraq.  Sectarian  hostility  and  corruption  at  all  levels  of  government
have  diluted  the  Iraqi  government’s  human  rights  protections.  Other  human  rights-
related  problems  include:  dangerous  conditions  in  prisons  and  detention  facilities;
arbitrary  arrest  and  pretrial  detention;  limits  on  freedom  of  expression  and  assembly;
and discrimination based on gender, race, and religion.
