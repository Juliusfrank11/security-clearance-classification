Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.o,  with  a  narrative  explanation.  His
admissions and explanation are  incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough
and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 33 years old. He and his wife have been married since 2011, and they
have three young children. He graduated high school in 2007 and attended some college,
using loans that are now alleged in the SOR. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy
from 2013 to 2017, with an honorable discharge. He was an E-4 sonar technician. (AE K
He said he held a clearance in the Navy. (Tr. 10, 26, 29-30, 33, 87; GE 1) He was awarded
a  Navy  and  Marine  Corps  Achievement  Medal,  a  Good  Conduct  Medal,  the  National
Defense Service Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. (AE K)
After leaving the Navy in 2017, Applicant moved with his family to a small town in
a neighboring state. He found it difficult to find work to pay off the bills that remained from
his time in the Navy. He worked for a glass manufacturing company, among other jobs,
before finding his current position in the defense industry in October 2018. He currently
earns about $31 an hour. (AE L) This is well more than the hourly wage in his two prior
jobs ($16.50 and 11.23 an hour). (Tr. 44) He estimated that he earned about $59,000 in
income in 2021, and estimated a similar income in 2020. (Tr. 30-32, 43-44)
Applicant  said  he  incurred  debts  through  schooling  and  a  repossessed  auto  he
could not afford when he left the Navy. (Tr. 28-29) He also had other debts that he thought
were resolved when he left, and incurred more debts after his income dropped in civilian
life. (Tr. 84-85) His wife is largely a homemaker caring for their young children.
Applicant  acknowledged  that  when  he  was  in  the  Navy,  the  DOD  issued  him  a
letter of intent (LOI) to deny his clearance, for financial reasons, in 2013. He was granted
a  conditional  clearance  in  2014,  contingent  on  documentation  of  monthly  financial
statements  to  his command.  He did  not have  to participate  in formal credit counseling
beyond keeping his command informed of his financial plans. (Tr. 10, 33, 45-47) The LOI
and the DOD’s decision are not in the record. Applicant acknowledged that his financial
plans and structure deviated after he was granted a clearance. He took out a car loan of
$600 a month. (Tr. 47)
While  in  the  Navy,  Applicant  was  arrested  on  a  domestic  battery  charge  after
becoming  intoxicated,  and  received  non-judicial  punishment.  (This  offense  was  not
alleged  in the SOR and  is not  considered as disqualifying conduct).  His  wife  was  also
suffering from a difficult medical condition (unrelated to the domestic offense). Applicant
sought guidance from a chaplain, and these factors prompted him to leave the Navy and
return to civilian life. As noted, he was discharged honorably.  (Tr. 47-48, 70-72, 85-86;
AE K)
In addition to working full time, Applicant is also attending technical school full time
to earn a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering. (Tr. 29) His current schooling is
covered under the GI Bill. (Tr. 93-95) He works a flexible schedule so he can be home to
attend school and help with child care. He has a long and lengthy commute to and from
work, to a different metropolitan area from where he lives. (Tr. 32-33)
Applicant has a few thousand dollars in a 401k plan at work. (Tr. 50) He estimated
that during winter, with high heating bills, he incurs about $4,500 in monthly expenses.
This is also about what he earns each month including about $400 monthly from the GI
Bill. He generally breaks even financially, but has little to no money saved in his bank
account,  and  lives  paycheck  to  paycheck.  (Tr.  50-52,  82,  88-89,  93-95)  Applicant  is
working off his other smaller debts, and does not want to incur new debt, while trying to
provide for his family. (Answer; Tr. 27-29, 81, 84) He wants to further his career and earn
more  income,  pay  his  debts,  and  buy  a  home.  He  loved  sonar  work  in  the  Navy,  and
wants to be able to do similar work as a contractor. (Tr. 27)
Applicant purchased a used car in May 2020. He traded in another car for $1,000
and made a $1,000 down payment. (Tr. 52) (The transcript also says the down payment
was for “$200,000,” a figure I have disregarded as clearly erroneous) (Tr. 52) He is current
on his $348 monthly car payment. (AE F; GE 5 at 2) Applicant attempts to keep a budget,
has watched credit counseling videos online, and has spoken to the VA about their credit
counseling program.  (Tr. 54, 83) He  submitted  credit report excerpts  reflecting that he
has between $25,800 and about $27,000 in total debt (AE B, AE C)
The Guideline F allegations in the SOR total about $59,000. They are established
through  Applicant’s  admissions  and  by  the  credit  reports  in  the  record.  (GE  2-GE  5)
Applicant also disclosed on his SCA that he had student loans in deferment, and had a
credit card “shut off.” (GE 1 at 48) The current status of his SOR debts is as follows:
SOR ¶  1.a  ($251) is a  gas bill placed  for collection. It  was incurred  when  Applicant
lived  in the  neighboring  state  after he  left  the  Navy. He believes the  debt  has  been  paid,
but is not certain. (Tr. 36, 55; GE 4 at 1)
SOR  ¶   1.b   ($1,260)  is  an   account  placed   for  collection   by   a   phone   company.
Applicant testified  that  earlier this  year he  negotiated  a  $500  settlement,  to  be  paid at  the
end of  March  2022. (Tr. 35-36, 56-58; GE  5 at  2)  The  record closed before  this payment
was documented,  but I consider it resolved.
SOR ¶  1.c ($369) is a  car insurance  bill placed  for collection.   It  remains unpaid,
though  Applicant has attempted to settle it. (Tr. 58-59; GE  5 at 2)
SOR  ¶   1.d   ($841)  is  an   unpaid  lease   from   an   apartment  where  Applicant   lived
when  he  was in the  Navy. He disputed  the  bill,  since  he  thought his living  expenses in the
Navy  were covered, but says his wife  told  him  he  still owes it. He now  intends to pay  the
debt.  (Tr. 59-61; GE 4  at 2)
SOR ¶  1.e  ($3,672) is a  bill placed  for collection. Applicant admitted  the  debt but
is unsure  what it is for, though  it might be  a  cell  phone  bill. He has  attempted  to  learn
more. It remains unpaid, though  at $3,462, less than alleged. (Tr. 61-62; GE 5  at 3)
SOR ¶¶  1.f  ($4,679), 1.g  ($5,606),  and  1.h  ($4,994) are federal student loan  debts
placed  for  collection.  They  were delinquent as of December 2020. (GE  4  at 3)  Applicant
made  several monthly  $5  payments  on  his student loans in  2020  and  2021, through  a  six-
month  loan  rehabilitation  program. His federal student loans are  now  consolidated  and  in
deferment  or  forbearance  because  he  is in  school. (AE  D, AE  G,  AE  H, AE  I, AE  J; Tr.
37-41.   62-66)   In   addition,  under  the   Coronavirus  Aid,   Relief,   and   Economic   Security
(CARES)   Act,   the   Biden   Administration   has  extended   the   COVID  pandemic  relief
program,  under which federal student loan  payments are deferred, through  August 2022.
Applicant estimated that he has about $15,000 to $20,000 in student loans  from
his undergraduate education prior to joining the Navy. (Tr. 38-41) This is confirmed by a
recent  credit  report.  (GE  5  at  3)  Applicant  mistakenly believed  he  did  not  have  to  pay
them, or they were deferred, while he was in the Navy. He also did not make payments
on these loans after leaving the Navy. (Tr. 65-66) He said his current schooling is covered
by the GI bill. (Tr. 41-42)
SOR ¶  1.i ($2,831) is  a  credit-card  account  that has been  charged  off  by  a  financial
institution. The  debt remains from  Applicant’s time  in the  Navy. He could not afford  to  pay
it when  he  left the  Navy. It  remains unpaid, though  Applicant has attempted  to  pursue
settlement.  (Tr. 67-68; GE 5  at 4)
SOR ¶  1.j ($26,044) is a  charged-off  account relating  to  an  auto  repossession. He
bought the  auto  in 2016, when  he  was in the  Navy, trading  in his wife’s car. Applicant said
he  owed  $17,000  when  the  vehicle  was repossessed,  and  that,  after it  was sold at auction,
he   owed   $11,000.  The   Government’s   evidence   indicates   that  he   owes  about  $18,200
after the resale.  The  debt remains unpaid.  (Tr. 28, 34,  68-69;  GE 5  at 2;)
SOR ¶  1.k ($4.405) is a  credit account that has been  charged  off.  Applicant and
his wife  used  the  account  for  personal  expenses, like  holidays and  trips. He  also  used  the
account for a  loan  on  a  motorcycle that he  bought in 2017, right before he  left the  Navy.
(Tr. 69-73)  He sold the  motorcycle  but GE  5  indicates that  for  the  account  at SOR ¶  1.k,
Applicant owed  over $7,000, as of  June  2021, and  the  debt remains outstanding. (Tr. 73-
74; GE 5 at 3;)
SOR  ¶   1.l  ($973)  is   an   account  that   has  been   charged   off.  Applicant  did  not
recognize the debt, though it is listed  on  his credit reports. (Tr. 74; GE 4 at 5, GE  5 at 5)
SOR  ¶   1.m   ($2,855)   is an   account  that   has   been   charged   off.  This  is the   same
creditor as  for the  debt  in SOR ¶  1.e,  and  Applicant believes they  are related.  Applicant
has contacted  the  creditor to  resolve  the  debt but it  remains unpaid.  Evidence  shows that
the  account has been  charged off  at $4,954. (GE 3 at 2;  Tr. 75-77)
SOR ¶  1.n  ($874) is an  electricity  bill placed  for collection.  (GE 3  at 2) It  is from
Applicant’s time in the  neighboring state. He is unsure of its status. (Tr. 77)
SOR  ¶   1.o   ($262)  is  an   account  placed   for  collection   by   an   internet  or  cable
provider. Applicant is unsure of its current status. (Tr. 77-78)  It is shown on  a  2018 credit
report, but no  others. (GE 2  at 8)
Applicant  submitted  proof  that  another,  unalleged  delinquent  debt,  to  a  military
credit card account, had been paid in April 2020. (Tr. 34-35, 78-79; AE E) He always files
his income tax returns and does not owe back taxes. (Tr. 79-80)
Two  work  references  provided  recommendation  letters.  Mr.  C  has  worked  with
Applicant for about three years. Mr. C was his supervisor for one year. According to Mr.
C, Applicant provides quality work in all respects, has good communication skills, and is
a dependable team player. He has good judgment and a mature, practical outlook. He is
an asset to the organization, and Mr. C recommends him highly. (AE A)
Mr. M attested that Applicant is a good co-worker who offers useful, knowledgeable
guidance. He is an essential part of the team, and he his detail-oriented approach helps
the  organization’s quality  control efforts.  He has an  excellent  work ethic and  performs with
integrity and professionalism. (AE A)
