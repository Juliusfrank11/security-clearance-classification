Having  thoroughly  considered  the  evidence  in  the  record,  including  Applicant's
admissions, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant  is  27  years  old  and  currently  married.  He  has  a  son,  age  six,  out  of
wedlock.  He  pays  child  support for his son, which  is taken  directly from  his paycheck.
He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in September 2012, and he received an honorable
discharge  from  active  duty  in  September  2016.  He  is  a  member  of  the  Marine  Corps
Inactive  Reserve  to  the  present  time.  Since  July  2019,  Applicant  is  employed  as  a
“CHUB1”  unpack  operator  in  a  chemical  handling  building  for  a  federal  contractor.  His
net monthly salary is approximately $4,200. His employer requires him to be eligible for
a position of trust to perform specific employment duties. (Tr. 15-16, 41-42; GE 1)
Applicant  stated  that  he  suffered  financial  problems  when  he  was  laid  off  from
employment  in  2017.  His  spouse  lost  her  school  employment  position  due  to  the
pandemic.  In  January 2022,  he  tested  positive  for  COVID.  He  was  sick  and  unable  to
work  for approximately  one  month.  He  used  40  hours of  his  vacation  and  16  hours  of
sick  leave  while  he  was  out  from  work.  At  that  time,  he  and  his  spouse  had  about
$10,000 in their savings account, which they depleted while he was unable to receive a
paycheck  for  the  remainder  of  the  month.  They  also  experienced  other  unexpected
family emergencies. At the hearing, he said it was his personal priority to save $10,000
again  in his savings  account  before he will  address paying off  other debts.  (Tr. 36-37,
43-47; GE 2)
The  SOR  alleged  under  Guideline  F  five  delinquent  debts  which  totaled
approximately  $31,116.  The  credit  reports  in  the  record  corroborate  the  delinquent
accounts. The current status of these debts is as follows: (GE 3, GE 4, GE 5)
1 Applicant was uncertain what the acronym “CHUB” stood for when asked during his hearing. Tr. 15.
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  a  $3,922  VA  Debt  Management  account  that  has  been
referred  for  collection.  Applicant  denied  this  debt  in  his  SOR  response.  During  the
hearing, he testified that he discovered two months ago after placing a phone call to the
creditor, that this account was for his unpaid medical bills. He mistakenly believed that
once he  was  discharged from  the military,  he  would  be  covered by TRICARE  medical
insurance  indefinitely.  He  later  learned  that  he  only  carried  medical  insurance  for
approximately six months after his 2016 discharge, but he continued to receive medical
treatment  from  the  VA  for  one  or  two  years  thereafter.  He  admitted  that  he  was
responsible for this debt. He has never made any payments on this account. He intends
to set-up a payment plan in the near future. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 16-20, 37-38;
SOR response)
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c allege two VA Debt Management accounts totaling $982 that
have  been  referred  for  collection.  Applicant  denied  these  debts  in  his  SOR  response,
but during the hearing, he admitted responsibility for these accounts. He also reiterated
that he had not made any payments on these accounts for unpaid medical services. He
intends to set-up payment plans in the near future. These debts remain unresolved. (Tr.
20, 37-38; SOR response)
SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  a  $26,014  charged-off  account  with  Wells  Fargo.  Applicant
admitted this debt in his SOR response, and at the hearing he stated that this account
was fully resolved. In 2016, he purchased a Jeep and financed it through Wells Fargo.
Since  he  voluntarily  returned  the  vehicle  in  2018,  he  no  longer  owed  any  deficiency
balance  on  this  account.  Applicant  claimed  that  he  had  called  the  creditor  a  year  ago
and  was  informed  that  he  did  not  owe  any  deficiency  balance.  Department  Counsel
asked him if he could provide documentation that substantiated his claim, and Applicant
agreed to provide documentation post-hearing. Applicant did not provide any supporting
documentation by March 15, 2022, and this debt is unresolved. (Tr. 20-23, 38-42; SOR
response)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  a  $198  T-Mobile  account  referred  for  collection.  Applicant
admitted this debt and testified at the hearing that  he had not made any payments on
this  account,  but  he  intended  to  pay  the  account  in  full  with  his  upcoming  paycheck.
Department Counsel requested Applicant  provide  documentation that the account  was
paid  in  full  during  the  two-week  period  the  record  was  held  open.  Applicant  did  not
provide any supporting documentation by March 15, 2022, and this debt is unresolved.
(Tr. 23-24; SOR response)
Applicant admitted that after paying all of his monthly expenses on a monthly net
income  of  about  $4,200,  he  had  about  $1,000  left  over  at  the  end  of  the  month.  He
stated that he uses some of that money to make an extra payment on his vehicle loan
by doubling his current car payment of $300 to $600.  He has doubled his car payment
on six or seven occasions in 2021 in an effort to raise his credit rating. When questioned
by Department Counsel for an explanation as to why he did not use any of the $1,000
monthly remainder  to  pay  his  delinquent  accounts,  Applicant  stated  that  he  just  never
considered these debts when he is paying his bills. (Tr. 23-24, 28-37)
Applicant  has  not  received   any   financial   counseling.  He   is  current  on   all   of  his
income  tax  return filings.  Beginning  in about 2018, his tax  refunds for  the following  three
years were intercepted  to  pay  back  child  support.  He  stated  that this year he  should get
a  tax  refund  of about $6,800,  which he  intends to  use  to  pay  his  delinquent  debts  and
place  any  remainder into  his  savings account.  When  questioned  about  the  previous tax
year,  he   admitted   that  he   received   a   2020   tax   refund   in  2021   for  about  the   same
amount. The  SOR  was issued  in  January  2021,  and  he  admitted  that  he   did  not apply
any  of  his 2020  tax  refund  to  make  payments  on  any  of  his outstanding  debts.  (Tr.  29-
37, 42-49)
Personal Conduct
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  falsified  his  July  2019  SCA  when  he  failed  to
disclose adverse financial information, such as whether he had defaulted on any loans,
had  any  repossessions,  or  had  any  accounts  past-due  or  referred  for  collection  within
the last seven years. (¶ 2.a) At the hearing Applicant testified that when he filled out the
SCA he was not aware that he was delinquent with the VA for unpaid medical services
or past due with his T-Mobile account. He did admit, however, that he was aware that
his  Jeep  had  been  repossessed  in  2018  for  non-payment.  He  knew  he  had  financial
issues  after  he  was  laid-off  from  work  in  2017,  which  was  stressful,  and  he  dealt  with
that stress by ignoring  his financial obligations. He stated, “…I’m not going to  look and
see if I do have any debts.” (Tr. 25-28, 38-41, 47-48; SOR response; GE 1)
The   second   SOR  allegation   under  Guideline   E   alleged   that  during   Applicant’s
background  interview  on  August 19, 2019,  he falsified  material facts after he  denied  that
he  had  any  delinquent  accounts  or repossessions when  questioned  by  the  investigator.
(¶  2.b)   Applicant   was  then   confronted   with   information   about  his   repossessed   vehicle
and  the   outstanding   balance   on   his  loan.  Applicant  then   explained   to   the   investigator
that   he   had   been   delinquent   on   the   car   loan   for  approximately   one   year   and   that  the
Jeep  was  eventually  repossessed  in 2018.  He  contacted the  creditor in  July  2019  to  set-
up   a   monthly   payment  plan   of  $220   to   pay   the   outstanding   deficiency   balance   of
$17,775.  He   had   made   two   monthly   installments;  one   payment   last   month   and   his
second   payment  the   same   month   of   his  interview.  Applicant  also  discussed   his  other
delinquent   accounts   which  were  attributed   to   his  2017   lay-off   from   employment.   His
2019   statement   to   the   investigator  acknowledging   a   deficiency   balance   on   his
repossessed  Jeep  is inconsistent with  his testimony  during  the  hearing.  (Tr. 25-28, 38-
41, 46-47; SOR response; GE 1, GE  2)
