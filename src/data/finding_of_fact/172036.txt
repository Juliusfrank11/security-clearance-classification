overseas and lacked some W-2 forms. (Tr. 50-51) He was deployed from 2017 to May

According  to  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  website,  U.S.  Citizens  and
Resident  Aliens  Abroad,  https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/us-
citizens-and-resident-aliens-abroad:
If you qualify for the  2-month  extension but are unable to  file your return by
the   automatic  2-month   extension   date,  you   can   request  an   additional
extension   to   October  15   by   filing   Form   4868,  Application   for  Automatic
Extension   of Time  To  File  U.S.  Individual Income  Tax   Return,   before  the
automatic 2-month  extension  date.  If you  are  allowed  extensions  to  June  15
and/or October  15, you  will owe  interest  on  any  unpaid  tax  amount  from  the
original due  date of the return (April 18, 2022, for calendar year 2021).
According to the IRS rules, Applicant’s TY 2017 tax return was due in July 24, 2018
because  he  did  not  request  an  extension.  When  he  sent  his  2017  federal  income  tax
return to the IRS, his tax preparer signed his return; however, he failed to sign it. (Tr. 43;
AE C)
Applicant’s  federal  income  tax  return  for  TY  2017  indicated  an  adjusted  gross
income of $39,000, and a refund of $1,752. (AE C) His federal income tax return did not
indicate that he was receiving a dependent deduction for any of his children.  Applicant
will not receive a credit or refund for the $1,752 for the overpayment from the IRS because
he filed his tax return more than three years after the due date. See IRS website, Don’t
Lose Your Refund by Not Filing, https://www.irs.gov/individuals/dont-lose-your-refund-by-
not-filing. (noting “There is usually no penalty for failure to file, if you are due a refund.
But, if you wait too long to file a return or otherwise claim a refund, you risk losing your
refund altogether. . . . Generally, after the three-year window closes, the IRS can neither
send a refund for the specific tax year nor apply any credits, including overpayments of
estimated or withholding taxes, to other tax years that are underpaid.”).
In  January  2022,  Applicant  and  the  IRS  agreed  on  a  settlement  agreement  to
address a debt for $10,527. (Tr. 41-43, 53-54) On March 8, 2022, Applicant made his two
monthly payment of $175. (Tr. 41-44; AE P) His tax debt resulted from IRS Form 1099s
employers  submitted  for  his  part-time  employments  in  TYs  2014  through  2016,  which
were not included in the income on those tax returns. (Tr. 49, 52)
Applicant  completed  credit  counseling  on  March  10,  2022.  (AE  T)  His  gross
monthly salary is $3,979. (AE U) His child support and medical insurance cost $1,246 a
month. (AE U) He listed six debts totaling $22,931. (AE U) He indicated his net monthly
remainder was negative $160. (AE U) His personal financial statement included his $175
monthly payment to the IRS. (AE U) If he is able to obtain a security clearance, his annual
pay will be $104,000. (Tr. 46) Most of his overseas pay will not be taxed by the federal
government, and his housing will be free. (Tr. 46) At the end of March 2022, Applicant
returned to the Middle East country for employment.
