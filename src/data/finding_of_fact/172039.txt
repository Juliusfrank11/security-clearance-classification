In Applicant’s original answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a
and denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b. In his amended answer to the SOR, he did not
expressly admit or deny SOR ¶ 2.a, but he argued that it was irrelevant. I have treated
his response to SOR ¶ 2.a as a denial. Applicant’s admissions in his answer and at the
hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 38-year-old business intelligence developer employed by a defense
contractor  since  June  2018.  He  worked  for  a  home-improvement  store  for  about  six
months  before  being  hired  by  his  current  employer.  He  has  never  held  a  security
clearance. He has never married and has no children. His father is a retired Navy veteran.
His father and brother are both disabled, and he takes care of them. (Tr. 2 at 16, 119.)
In March 2001, Applicant, then 17 years old, was employed at a gas station located
on a military installation. Because the amount of the money in the cash register did not
match the amount of gas that was sold, an investigation was initiated. There was a cash
shortage of $20.87 on March 30, 2001, and a surveillance camera was installed in the
office, which captured a video of Applicant taking money from the cash register. He was
accused of embezzling about $200 by ringing a “no sale” on the cash register on several
occasions and keeping the cash. At the hearing, he admitted taking money from the cash
register, but stated that he needed exact change for bus fare and sometimes exchanged
his money for smaller bills or change in the cash register. (Tr. 2 at 14-15.)
At the  hearing, Applicant  testified  that  he  believed  the  cash  shortage  at the  gas
station  occurred  because   employees  programmed  the  gas pumps  incorrectly  so  that a
$1.97  transaction   was  registered   as   19   cents.  He   believed   that   the   programming   error
caused  the  loss of about $3,000  and  triggered  the  investigation.  (Tr.  2  at 99.)  He  testified
that,  after the  investigation,  the  loss-prevention  supervisor concluded  that there was no
embezzlement,   and   no   further  action   was  taken.  (Tr.   2   at  14-16.)  The   incident  report
reflects that Applicant was turned  over to  his mother, but it does not reflect any  legal or
administrative  actions  taken  against  him.  (GX  3.) This incident was the  basis for SOR ¶
1.b.   The   juvenile   court   records  of   the   jurisdiction   where  Applicant  resided   and   worked
reflect no  record of  a  charge  or conviction  of  embezzlement or any  other criminal activity.
(Answer to SOR, Exhibit B.)
Applicant attended a community college from 2002 to 2006, while working as an
information technology consultant and earning about $40,000 per year. He dropped out
of school because he was failing. His girlfriend at the time (GF), who was nine years older
than him and who worked for a credit union, introduced him to business friend (BF) who
was involved in real estate.
BF was the owner and operator of a real estate development company as well as
the  owner  and  operator  of  an  apartment  building  management  company.  He  had  a
reputation for successfully revitalizing communities. (GX 8 at 20.) He and several others
purchased  multiple-family  buildings,  converted  them  to  condominiums,  and  sold  the
condominiums as individual units. BF’s business staff  included a mortgage broker, two
experienced  realtors,  a  certified  real  estate  appraiser,  and  an  experienced  real  estate
lawyer, all of whom were in their 30s and 40s. One realtor was in his 60s. (GX 10 at 2.)
Around September 2006, BF offered Applicant an opportunity to become involved in the
enterprise, and Applicant accepted it. (Tr. 2 at 17-18.). He was 23 years old at the time.
(GX 1 at 7.)
Applicant,  GF,  BF,  and  others  recruited  buyers  to  purchase  condominiums  as
investment  properties  or  second  homes.  In  fact,  the  properties  were  rentals  and  had
tenants living in them. Buyers were assured that they would not be required to make down
payments, pay closing costs, or be responsible for mortgage payments, even if they did
not have renters in their units. They were promised that they would share in the profits
when the units were sold. (GX 4; Tr. 2 at 57.)
Once a potential buyer agreed to participate, BF and others involved in the scheme
would  engage  mortgage  loan  brokers  and  mortgage  originators  to  prepare  loan
applications which reflected a falsely inflated purchase price; falsely represented that the
buyer would occupy the condominium as a primary or secondary residence; and falsely
represented that the buyer had substantial assets. The buyer’s income would be inflated
in  the  mortgage  application  by  adding  the  anticipated  rental  income  from  the
condominium to the buyer’s other income. (Tr. 2 at 37.) BF and others would arrange with
a closing attorney to prepare false documents, including a HUD-1 settlement statement,
which would falsely represent that the buyer had made a down payment and paid closing
costs. The mortgage lenders would then fund the mortgage loan through a wire transfer
to  the  bank  account  of  the  closing  attorney.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  would  then  be
disbursed to BF, who paid a 3% commission to the person who recruited the buyer. (GX
7 at 6-7.)
Applicant started  an  investment  consulting  business in  April 2007.  (GX  1  at   17.)
He used  this business to  recruit buyers for BF’s enterprise. (GX  4.) Applicant recruited  11
or 12  buyers who were his friends or friends of  his friends. (Tr. 2  at 42.)
In November 2006, Applicant purchased a condominium through BF’s enterprise
as an investment. The purchase price was $302,000. He wrote a check for $1,000. The
documentation for the purchase falsely reflected that he had made a payment of $20,000
for closing costs and had about $23,000 in his bank account. (GX 7 at 8.) On the same
day, he purchased a second condominium in a similar transaction. (GX 9 at 1; Tr 2 at 36.)
He used the rental income from the two condominiums to pay the mortgages. (Tr.  2 at
31-34.)
Applicant was not directly involved in the preparation of the falsified documents.
However,  he  did  attend  about  23  closings,  in  which  he  signed  documents  for  buyers,
using a power of attorney. (Tr. 2 at 46-48.) He testified that he knew the closings included
fraudulent documents, but insisted that he did not intend to participate in fraud. He knew
that the buyers were not paying the closing costs as represented in the documents, but
“everybody  knew  they  were not coming  from  the  buyer. The  lawyers knew. The  banks
know.” (Tr.  2 at  48.) He  testified  that  he  thought  it  “made  sense” for buyers to  include
anticipated future income from rentals in their statements of current assets. (Tr. 2 at 50.)
When he signed closing documents, he thought he was “just signing documents,” and he
was not thinking about whether they were factually correct. (Tr. 2 at 51.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  young  at  the  time  and  depended  on  the  more
experienced members of the operation to know what should be done. He admitted that
his lawyer told him that he was guilty of “willful blindness.” (Tr. 2 at 53.) He admitted that
he had questions about some of the transactions, but the more experienced members of
the enterprise gave him answers, and his concerns were superseded by their experience,
knowledge, and professional licenses. (Tr. 2 at 85.)
Applicant earned a 3% commission for each buyer that he recruited. He expected
to  earn  $182,000,  but  he  received  only  about  $50,000.  He  testified  that  he  stopped
recruiting for BF because he was not being paid. (Tr. 2 at 78.) When the real estate market
declined, most of the mortgage  loans involved in the fraud went into default and some
went into foreclosure. (GX 7 at 7.) During the sentencing proceedings, the government
presented  evidence  that  the  fraudulent  scheme  created  mortgage  company  losses
aggregating $2,844,565 for 16 properties purchased by buyers that Applicant recruited.
(GX 9 at 2.) Applicant’s two  mortgage loans defaulted, and his properties created bank
losses of $239,800 and $284,500 respectively. (GX 9 at 1.)
Court  records  reflect  multiple  judgments  obtained  against  Applicant  between
March 2008 and February 2009. He filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in May 2009
and his debts were discharged in October 2009. He filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition
in August 2010, which was dismissed in December 2010. He filed another Chapter 13
bankruptcy petition in July 2011, which was dismissed in August 2011. (GX 5.)
Applicant was arrested in November 2006. After a lengthy investigation, he was
indicted in September 2010 for 11 counts of wire fraud and 6 counts of bank fraud (GX 7
at 47.) On November 28, 2015, pursuant to a plea agreement, he pleaded guilty to one
count of wire fraud and one count of bank fraud. The remaining counts were dismissed.
(GX 11 at 1) He was sentenced to imprisonment for 24 months and supervised probation
for  36  months  after  release  from  prison.  (GX  11  at  3.)  He  served  his  sentence  and
successfully completed his probation in September 2020. (GX 12.).
While Applicant was awaiting trial, he finished the requirements for an associate’s
degree in December 2010. He earned a bachelor’s degree in May 2013 and  a master’s
degree in May 2015. He also worked for a non-government company as the manager of
business intelligence until he surrendered to government authorities to serve his sentence
to incarceration. His supervisor observed that he demonstrated discretion and integrity in
all his business dealings, that he had a strong sense of community, and that he routinely
volunteered for or directly supported many charitable events to benefit military personnel
and  veterans.  (Answer  to  SOR,  Attachment  1.)  A  coworker  who  became  a  friend
describes him as hardworking, smart, incredibly loyal, and selfless in his efforts to help
others. The coworker is familiar with the facts that led to his conviction and regards them
as  an  anomaly and a life  lesson. She  regards  him as  a faithful and  trustworthy friend.
(Answer to SOR, Attachment 2.)
Applicant also  was ordered to pay restitution  of $3,786,815  and was  ordered to
forfeit at least $7,413,712, jointly and severally with his co-defendants. (GX 11 at 5,11.)
He has been paying the restitution at the rate $50 per month since 2015 and is current
on  his payments.  (Tr. 2  at 97-98.)  He filed a petition for commutation  of  his sentence,
which was still pending at the time of the hearing. (AX C.) He testified that the purpose of
his clemency petition is to obtain a review of the restitution requirement. (Tr. 2 at 96.)

imprisonment  for  two  years,  three  years  of  supervised  probation,  and  ordered  to  pay
restitution of $3,099,224 and forfeit $7,413.712. BF was sentenced to imprisonment for
135  months,  five  years  of  supervised  probation,  and  ordered  to  pay  restitution  of
$11,374.201 and to forfeit $7,413.712. (GX 4.)

On November 20, 2020, the governor of the state where Applicant resides and is
employed restored his civil rights and removed the political disabilities resulting from his
conviction, except the ability to ship, transport, possess or receive firearms. His right to
vote, hold public office, serve on a jury, and be a notary public were restored. (Answer to
SOR, Exhibit A.)
Applicant  was  working  for  his  current  employer  when  the  SOR  was  issued.  His
performance  appraisal  for  June  2020  through  June  2021  rated  him  as  “exceeds  job
requirements,” the highest rating. His appraiser made the following comments at the end
of his appraisal: “[Applicant] is one of the best supply chain SME- (subject matter expert)
we have, plus equally proficient from [a] technical standpoint as well. Another great year
completed with flying colors!” (AX A.)
