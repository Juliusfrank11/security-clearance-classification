Applicant is 33 years old and a high school graduate who has taken some college
courses. He has never married and has no children. He joined the U. S. Army in 2009 but
was discharged under other than honorable conditions in January 2011, due to his failure
to  meet  three  required  reserve  evolutions.  Applicant  missed  those  evolutions  due  to
financial and transportation issues. In each instance, he notified his unit that he would be
unable to attend, because  of circumstances beyond his control. Those absences were
the cause of his discharge. (Item 5.) From the date of  Applicant’s discharge in January
2011 to January 2013, he was unemployed. In about 2012, during his unemployment, he
fell behind on the payments of some of his debts. (Item 5.) Applicant is seeking to obtain
eligibility to occupy a position of public trust, because his sponsor provides services to
the Department of Defense, and his job would involve access to sensitive but unclassified
information. (Item 3.)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged 11 delinquent debts totaling $27,667. SOR
¶¶1.a.  through  1.g.  are  education  loans  totaling  $26,346.  (Item  1.)  Applicant’s  Answer
and Response admitted those debts. Those loans have been consolidated and that he is
current on monthly payments paying down those loans. Those payments range between
$128 in January 2020 and $117 in May 2021. Applicant provided documents supporting
that assertion. His payments began before the SOR was issued in May 2020. (Item 3 and
Response.)
Applicant denied SOR ¶¶1.h. through 1.k., which total $1,321. He stated that he
disputed those debts, thereby causing them to be removed from his credit reports. (Item
3 and Response.) The Government’s most recent credit reports in the record (December
2019 and September 2021) support that assertion; those four SOR debts do not appear
on those reports. (Items 7 and 8.)  Applicant did not provide any documents of his own to
support his assertion. The SOR debts became delinquent between June 2016 and June
2019. (Items 6 and 7.)
