After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  66  years old,  married,  with  two  adult  children.  He  has  a  bachelor’s
degree. Applicant has worked for a defense contractor since February 2015. He served
in  the  U.S.  Army  on  active  duty  from  March  1974  until  September  1987,  and  in  Army
Reserve components from 2000 to 2015. All of his discharges were honorable. (Item 3.)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant has 11 delinquent debts totaling
$117,979. Applicant denied those Guideline F delinquencies, except for one. He admitted
¶1.b.  He  denied  ¶¶  1.a.,  1.c.,  and  1.d.  (duplicate  charges),  ¶¶  1.e.  and  1.f.  (invalid
collections), ¶¶ 1.g., 1.i., and 1. j. (paid), ¶1. k. (invalid charge), and ¶ 1.h. (“never had
card in his name”).
Under Guideline E, SOR ¶ 2.a. alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose
the delinquent accounts listed in SOR ¶ 1. SOR ¶ 2.a. alleged that Applicant additionally
failed to disclose a mortgage account that went into foreclosure in 2015. To SOR ¶ 2.a.,
he answered that “rental property went into foreclosure.”
Applicant  provided  no  documents  in  support  of  his  Answers  to  the  SOR.  The
evidence supports the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. (Items 5 and 6.) Aside
from  one  mortgage  account  in  foreclosure,  Applicant  claimed  no  knowledge  of  the
delinquent  accounts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  (Item  4.)  He  was,  however,  knowledgeable
enough  to  answer  with  some  detail  about  those  accounts,  including  details  about  the
mortgage account. (Items 2 and 4.)
