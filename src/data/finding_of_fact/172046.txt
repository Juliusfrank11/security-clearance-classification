Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings
of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I
make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  41  years old.  He  has  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  since  March
2003. He holds a master’s degree. He is married and has two children, ages 13 and 8.
He has held a security clearance since 2004. (Tr. 6, 21-22; GE1, 4)
Under  Guideline  H,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant  used  marijuana  from  2007  to
October 2017, while having access to classified information. (SOR ¶ 1.a) Under Guideline
E, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately gave false information on his March 2013
security clearance application  (SCA)  when  he failed to disclose his illegal drug  use as
stated in SOR ¶ 1.a above. (SOR ¶ 2.d)
Applicant admitted all of his illegal drug use, and his deliberate false answers given
on his 2013 SCA. Applicant began using marijuana in high school and continued his use
through his college years. He graduated from college in 2002. He was hired by his current
employer in 2003 and was investigated for and received a security clearance in 2004. He
claims he listed his previous high school and college drug use on his first SCA, however,
that document is not part of  the  record  so it cannot  corroborate  his assertion.  He also
asserts  that  he  stopped  using  marijuana  from  the  time  of  his  hiring  (2003)  until
approximately 2007, when he began using marijuana again. He started using marijuana
in 2007 on a recreational basis approximately two to five times a year. He used it with
college friends and while on vacation with his friends. He remains friends with some of
the people with whom he smoked marijuana, and they continue to use marijuana in his
presence. He claims they respect his decision not to use marijuana any longer. Applicant
was  aware  that  marijuana  use  violated  his  company’s  drug  policy  and  that  using
marijuana was illegal in the state where he was using it. He now lives in a state where
marijuana use is legal under state law. His wife works for the same employer and also
holds a security clearance. She did not and does not use marijuana and was unhappy
about Applicant’s use  of  it.  He continued to use marijuana until approximately October
2017, when he stopped using it. He testified that there was no monumental event that led
to his cessation of marijuana use. Shortly thereafter, he reported his marijuana use to his
employer. In April 2018, he received a letter of reprimand for violating the company’s drug
policy. He has never received any drug treatment or counseling. He provided a written
statement of his intent not to use illegal drugs in the future. (Tr. 23, 26-33, 41-43; SOR
Answer; AE E-G)
Applicant  admitted  that  he  knowingly  falsified  his  2013  SCA  by  not  listing  his
marijuana use. He claims he was embarrassed to disclose this information at the time
and  he  knew  his  use  of  marijuana  was  wrong.  He  continued  to  use  marijuana  after
completing this SCA. After his disclosure to his employer in 2017-2018, he completed an
SCA in March of 2018 where he disclosed his previous marijuana use. (Tr. 31-33; GE 1,
5)
Applicant  is  involved   in  community   activities   such   as  coaching   youth   activities,
helping  out at school activities,  and  serving  as a  substitute  teacher. His volunteer work at
his  children’s  school  was  commended   by   the   school  principal   and   assistant  principal.
Applicant  was  characterized   as  a   valuable   school  asset   and   positive   influence.   He
provided  letters of support from  two  work supervisors who  describe Applicant as  honest,
trustworthy, and  very  remorseful for his conduct that led  to  this point.  They  recommend
him  for a  position  of  trust.  Applicant also provided  letters of  commendation  where he  was
recognized  for his contributions to  team  successes. His work evaluations  from  2003  to
2020  characterize  him as follows: satisfactory  contributor (2003), h
igh  contributor (2004-
2006),  exceptional  (2007-2011),  20%  (2012),  exceeded   (2015,  2018),  significantly
exceeded (2013-2014, 2016-2017, 2019-2020). (Tr. 22-23; AE  B-D)
