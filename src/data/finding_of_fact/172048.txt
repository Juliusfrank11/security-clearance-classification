After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 35 years old and is a high school graduate. He married in 2007 and
was divorced in 2016. Applicant had two children (a son nine and a daughter twelve) from
that marriage. He remarried in 2017. The two children live with Applicant and his current
wife. Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from 2005 until 2016, when
he was separated with an other than honorable discharge. (Item 2.)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  has  nine  delinquent  debts  totaling  $36,882.
Applicant admitted those delinquencies. He claimed that he was paying on two of those
accounts and was settling a third account. Applicant claimed that his sudden discharge
from  the  Marine  Corps  contributed  to  his  financial  difficulties.  (Item  3.)  Applicantâ€™s
delinquencies range from 2016 to 2021. (Items 4 through 7.) He provided no documents
in support of his Answer.
