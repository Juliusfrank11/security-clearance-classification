Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR, with explanations and updates. After a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and is a Captain in
the Air Force Reserve. (TR at page 15 line 14 to page19 line 24, and GX 1 at pages 7
and 18.) He has held a security clearance since 2011 (GX 1 at page 90). He is married,
has one child, and he and his family live in the United States. (TR at page 17 line 14 to
page 18 line 1). From 2016~2018, Applicant attended National Taiwan University. This
is  where  he  met  his  wife,  and  all  his  other  acquaintances  noted  in  subparagraphs
1.d~1.j., which will be discussed further, below. (TR at page 16 line 21 to page 17 line
14.)
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a.  Applicant’s  wife   is  a   citizen   of   China,  whom   he   met  in  graduate   school  in
Taiwan. (TR at page  17  lines  15~23,  and  at page  29  line  15  to  page  30  line  2.)   His wife
is the  “Executive  Assistant for the  CEO  of  a  [U.S.]  company  . . . which  handles traveling
nurses.” (TR at page 36 line  24 to page 37 line 3.)
1.b.  Applicant’s  mother-in-law   and   father-in-law   are  citizens  and   residents  of
China. He  has  little,  if any, relationship  with  his in-laws. “They  don’t speak English,” and
he   does   not  speak   their   “local  dialect.”  (TR  at  page   20   line   11   to   page   21   line   2.)
Applicant’s father-in-law  “was a  public-school  teacher,”  and  his mother-in-law  a  “retired  .
. . accountant.” (TR at page 36 at line 24 to page 37 line 3.)
1.c. Applicant’s wife has three uncles, five aunts, two cousins, two grandmothers,
and  a  grandfather  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of  China.  Only  her  uncle,  who  is  a
building inspector, arguably has any connection with the Chinese government. Applicant
“never met him,” and does not “even know his name.” (TR at page 33 line 13 to page 34
line 15, and at page 37 line 19 to page 38 line 14.)
1.d. Applicant has a friend, whom he met at university in Taiwan, who is a citizen
of  and  resides  in  Germany.  He  works  “for  a  Taiwanese  Company  that  manufacture
semi-conductors.”  Applicant’s  only  contact  with  this  friend  is  “with  [a]  group  chat  .  .  .
maybe once a month.” (TR at page 38 line 15 to page 39 line 7, see also TR at page 22
lines 7~21.)
1.e. Applicant’s “thesis  advisor”  is a  citizen  of Hong  Kong  and  resides in Taiwan.
He has  “had  zero contact with  him  since  .  . .  [Applicant]  delivered  .  .  . [his] thesis  . .  . [in]
Spring  2018,”  about four years ago.
1.f.  and  1.g.  Applicant  had  friends  who  are  citizens  of  Honduras  and  reside  in
Taiwan.  The  husband  works  for  the  Honduran  embassy.  Applicant  has  “zero  contact
with him.” The wife “does . . . a lot of non-profit kind of stuff.”  Applicant  texts  her  about
“once every six months.” (TR at page 34 line 16 to page 35 line 3, and at page 40 line 1
to page 41 line 8.)
1.h.  Applicant  does  not  have   any   friends  who   are  citizens  and   residents  of
Taiwan. (TR at page  41 line  9 to page  42 line 10.)
1.i.  Applicant  has  a   friend,  whom   he   met   at  a  university   in  Taiwan,  who   is  a
citizen  of and  resides in  India.  “He’s been  involved  in  some,  like   green   energy   startup
kind   of  stuff.”  Applicant’s  only   contact  with   this  friend   is  “in  the   group   chat  .   .  .  maybe
once  a  month.” (TR at  page 42  lines 11~20.)
1.j.  Applicant  had   a   friend   who   is  a   citizen   and   resident  of  South   Korea.  They
have  “lost contact” with  each  other, “haven’t talked  to  her in a  year or so.” (TR at page
42 line 21  to  page 43 line 4.)
Notice
I  take administrative  notice  of  the following facts  regarding Taiwan:  Taiwan  is a
democracy led by a president and parliament selected in multiparty elections. In 1979,
the  United  States  switched  diplomatic  recognition  from  Taiwan  to  Chine.  Taiwanese
espionage  against  the  United  States  has  not  been  limited  to  industrial  espionage,  but
also to dual-use or military technology. (HX I.)
I take administrative notice of the following facts regarding the People’s Republic
of China (China). China is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party
is  the  paramount  authority.  China  has  expansive  efforts  in  place  to  acquire  U.S.
technology  to  include  secrets  and  proprietary  information.  About  80  percent  of  all
economic espionage  prosecutions  brought  by the  U.S.  Department of  Justice  relate to
the Chinese state. (HX II.)
