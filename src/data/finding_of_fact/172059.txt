In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.j and
denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.k. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 40-year-old public affairs specialist employed by a federal contractor
since December 2016. He attended a university from September 2012 to May 2016 but
did not receive a degree. He served in the Army National Guard from February 2005 to
June 2016 and was honorably discharged as a staff sergeant (pay grade E-6). He has
never married and has no children. His SCA reflects that he has never held a security
clearance. (FORM Item 2 at 27-28.)
Applicant disclosed in his SCA that he had not filed his federal and state income
tax returns since December 2016, and that he owed an estimated $5,000 in taxes. He did
not  specify  whether  his  tax  debt  was  federal,  state,  or  both.  (FORM  Item  2  at  28.)  In
response to DOHA interrogatories, he stated that he had not filed his federal and state
tax returns for tax years 2016 through 2020. He did not know whether he owed any federal
taxes. He stated that he owed state taxes and did not know how much he owed in state
taxes, but he declared, “I assume a lot.” (FORM Item 3 at 3-5.) When he was interviewed
by a security investigator, he stated that he did not file his federal and state returns for
2016 because his income was too low to require him to pay taxes. He stated that he did
not file his federal and state returns for subsequent years because he was working on
personal development and focusing on other things. (FORM Item 3 at 8.) His failures to
file federal and state income tax returns are alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b.
Credit reports from December 2020 and December 2021 (FORM Items 4 and 5)
reflect eight student loans placed for collection totaling  $50,151. The last activity on all
these loans was in April 2017.  They were all placed for collection and assigned to the
government  in  December  2020.  Applicant  told  a  security  investigator  that  he  had  not
made any effort to resolve them. (FORM Item 3 at 10.) The delinquent student loans are
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.j, which Applicant admitted.
The  December  2021  credit  report  (FORM  Item  5)  reflects  a  credit-card  account
that was charged off for $2,763 in May 2016. Applicant told the security investigator that
he was unaware that it was charged off. (FORM Item 3 at 8.) He submitted no evidence
of  efforts  to  resolve  the  debt.  The  debt  is  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.k.  Applicant  denied  this
allegation but provided no evidence or explanation to support his denial.
