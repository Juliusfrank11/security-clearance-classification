In her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations contained in the
SOR without further elaboration, evidence, or explanation. These allegations involved the
fact  that  her mother, father, sister, and  brother  are  all  resident  citizens  of  Poland.  Her
admissions are incorporated into these findings of fact.
Applicant is 40 years old. She earned a bachelor’s degree in Poland in May 2003,
and a master’s degree from a U.S. university in May 2008. She has never served in the
military or worked for the governments of either Poland or the United States. This is her
first  application  for  national  security  eligibility,  which  she  seeks  in  connection  with  her
defense contractor position as a linguist in Poland that she obtained in February 2020.
(Item 3; Item 4.)
Applicant  was  born  and  raised  in  Poland.  In  June  2003,  after  completing  her
education  there,  she  was  accepted  into  a  one-year  au  pair  program  and  came  to  the
United States to travel and further improve her English language skills. While here on that
J1  visa  she  applied  for  an  F1  student  visa,  which  was  granted.  She  remained  while
pursuing her master’s degree at a U.S. university from September 2004 until May 2008.
She married a native U.S. citizen in March 2008, becoming a permanent resident until
her naturalization as U.S. citizen in January 2012. Shortly thereafter, her divorce from her
husband  was  finalized  in  June  2012.  She  has  retained  her  Polish  citizenship  and  has
active passports from both nations. She claimed to have “equal allegiance  to  the  U.S.,
Poland, and [her] family in Poland.” (Item 3; Item 4.)
After her divorce,  Applicant lived  in a home owned by her aunt and uncle when
she was in the United States. She held full-time U.S. jobs from October 2018 to December
2019 and from August 2015 to September 2018, as well as part-time jobs from February
2016 to September 2018, and from April 2018 to June 2018. She also worked in two full-
time administrative positions in the medical field from April 2012 to October 2013, and as
a part-time caregiver for a U.S. home nursing company from July 2005 to February 2014.
(Item 3; Item 4.)
During that time she returned to Poland on numerous occasions to visit family and
look for employment there so she could move back. She was unsuccessful in finding a
job  in  Poland  until  obtaining  her  current  job  in  February  2020.  Since  her  U.S.
naturalization and divorce were final, she visited Poland from February 2014 to July 2015,
from  December  2017  to  January  2018,  from  June  2018  to  August  2018,  and  from
December 2019 to present. She lived with her parents from December 2019 to February
2020,  then  moved  into  military housing  on  a  Polish  Army  base  where  she  works.  She
wanted to return and live in Poland to be close to her family. (Item 3; Item 4.)
As Applicant admitted in her Answer, her mother, father, sister, and brother are
native citizens and residents of Poland. Her mother and brother are dentists, her father is
a retired provincial commander of the State Fire Service, and her sister is an ENT doctor.
Her mother and father are in their late sixties, and her siblings are 42 and 39 years old.
(Item 2, Item 4.)
The  record  contains  no  other  significant  evidence  concerning  Applicant’s  job
performance,  trustworthiness,  character  in  a  professional  setting,  or  track  record  with
respect to handling sensitive information and observation of security procedures. I was
unable to evaluate her credibility, demeanor, or character in person, since she elected to
have her case decided without a hearing.
As noted above, I take administrative notice of the facts about Poland that were
set  forth  in  the  official  U.S.  Government  publication  that  was  attached  to  Department
Counsel’s request for administrative notice. These include that Poland is a stalwart ally
of the United States, who is a NATO member, and with whom a strong relationship and
a shared commitment to freedom date back to the American Revolution.
