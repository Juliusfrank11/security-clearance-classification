Applicant is a 42-year-old aircraft mechanic for a defense contractor who seeks a
security clearance. The admitted  allegations are incorporated and adopted as relevant
and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant married in July 1999 and divorced in March 2006. (Item 4) He has one
child  from  this  marriage.  He  remarried  in  June  2006  and  has  one  child  from  this
marriage.  (Item  4)  Applicant  earned  an  associate’s  degree  in  April  2010.  (Item  4)  He
enlisted  in  the  Air  Force  in  July  2000  and  served  15  years  of  active  duty  before
receiving an honorable discharge in July 2015. (item 4)
Since August 2020, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as an
aircraft mechanic. (item 4) Previously, he worked for other employers in various types of
mechanic positions. He held a security clearance while in the Air Force, but has not held
one since his AF discharge in July 2015. (Item 4)
Applicant’s  finances
Applicant failed  to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2017 and
2018.    (Items   3-6)   Whether  he   ever  filed   his  federal   tax   returns  for   those   years   is
unclear. His IRS  tax  transcripts covering  his 2017  and  2018  tax  years confirmed  that,  as
of  April 28, 2021, Applicant had  not filed  his tax  returns for tax  years 2017-2018. (Item
6) His claims in  his response  of  filing  his tax  returns  for  these  years in  October 2021  are
not corroborated  and cannot be accepted  at face value without verification.
Applicant  became  indebted  to  the  IRS  for  delinquent  taxes  for  tax  years  2014,
2019,  and  2020.  (Items  1-6)  Summaries  furnished  from  the  IRS  document  his  taxes
owed for these years as follows: for 2014 ($909), for 2019 ($589), and for 2020 ($365).
(item 3) On October 2021, 2021, Applicant reached out to the IRS to reinstate his prior
installment  agreement.  (Item  2)  Under  the  terms  of  his  new  installment  agreement
approved  by  the  IRS,  Applicant  committed  to  paying  $50  a  month  to  the  IRS  on  his
agreed  $1,868  balance  owing.  (Items  2-3)  Reportedly,  Applicant  is  in  compliance  with
his payment terms.
Besides  his  tax  debts,  Applicant  accumulated  delinquent  student  loan  and
consumer  debts  exceeding  $13,000.  (Items  5-8)  His  listed  delinquent  student  loan
account  approximates  $10,529.  (Items  5-8)  He  is  also  indebted  to  three  consumer
creditors for moneys owed in excess of $3,000. (Items 5-8)
Since  September  2021,  Applicant  has  been  working  to  pay  off  his  delinquent
accounts. In February 2022, he paid off his student loan indebtedness with a lump sum
payment  of  $9,480.  (Item  9)  But  while  he  is  was  able  to  resolve  two  of  his  remaining
three consumer debts (i.e., SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.f) with pay-offs, he has not addressed his
remaining  consumer  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.c)  This  account  remains  unresolved  at  this  time.
Applicant  reported  joint  monthly  income  of  $7,004.  (Item  6)  He  reported  monthly
expenses of $6,561 and a net monthly remainder of $39. (Item 6)
Because there is a lack of documented information from Applicant in the record
to  assess his income tax filing status for tax years 2017  and  2018,  and the  remaining
delinquent  debt  (covered  by  SOR  ¶1.c),  no  favorable  inferences  can  be  drawn  as  to
whether  he  will  be  able  to  resolve  his  remaining  financial  issues  in  the  foreseeable
future.  Based  on  the  absence  of  sufficient  evidence  of  tax  filing  and  payment  history,
Applicant’s  prospects  for  addressing  his  delinquent  tax  filing  and  payment  issues  are
uncertain at best.
