Applicant  is  a  45-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has
worked  since  December  2016.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2002.  He  has  been
married  since  2006.  He  has  no  children.  Applicant  was  granted  a  clearance  in  2004
(Items 3, 6)
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  owes  13  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $81,000
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.m). The debts include, among other things, an unpaid mortgage, a debt
for professional services, credit cards, a telecommunications debt, medical debts, and a
utility debt. Applicant admitted the debts in the SOR, with no further comment. I find that
the SOR allegations are established through credit reports and Applicant’s admissions.
(Items 1-6)
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  paying  a  residential  mortgage
payment and a residential lease payment simultaneously without the requisite funds to
do so. He was responsible for both because, despite a realtor’s advice to  the  contrary,
he  was  unable  to  sell  his  home  in  State  A  after  moving  to  State  B  in  2012.  He  also
asserted that a bankruptcy attorney advised him to stop making payments on his credit
card  debts.  Applicant  alleged  that  he  later  consulted  with  another  bankruptcy  attorney
who suggested that he try to pay off his debts beginning with the smallest amounts. He
was unemployed from about September 2016 until December 2016 (Items 3, 6)
Despite averring that he would either repay or dispute the SOR debts, Applicant
has presented no evidence that  he has contacted creditors, made payments, disputed
any debts, offered or negotiated payment agreements, or taken any significant actions
to resolve his debts. All 13 SOR debts are unresolved. Applicant did not respond to the
FORM, so more recent information about his finances is not available. (Items 1-6)
