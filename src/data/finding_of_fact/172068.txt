The  SOR  identified  twenty-five  allegations  involving  delinquent  debts  totaling  in
excess of $24,297.  Applicant admits each of the allegations in the SOR.  Credit reports
of  the  Applicant  dated  May  27,  2020;  April  5,  2021;  and  December  21,  2021,  confirm
that she is indebted to each of the creditors listed in the SOR.  (Government Exhibits 3,
4, and 5.)  Applicant has been working for her current employer since October 2017.
Applicant  was  married  for  thirteen  years  from  2001  to  2016.  During  her
marriage, she had financial problems and filed for Bankruptcy on at least three separate
occasions, the first time in 2002, the second time in 2003, and the third time in 2013.  In
2003, her debt was discharged.  (Tr. p. 26.)  In 2013, the bankruptcy was dismissed for
failing to make payments according to the agreement.  (Tr. p. 26.)  Applicant contends
that the delinquent debts listed in the SOR were incurred in 2016, around the time she
was going through a divorce, or after, and before she obtained her current employment.
She confirmed that the debts are all her responsibility.  Applicant contacted a financial
advisor for assistance in resolving her debt.  The deposit to hire him was more than she
could afford, and so she is currently saving up to do it.  (Tr. pp. 20-22 and 39-40.)
