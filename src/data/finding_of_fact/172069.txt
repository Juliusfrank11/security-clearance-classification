Applicant  is  a  60-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  eligibility  for  access  to
classified  information  for  his  job  as  a  technical  support  engineer  for  a  company  in  the
defense industry. He has been employed by the same company since about September
2017  in  State  #1.  As  set  forth  below,  he  lived  in  State  #2  from  2006  to  late  2017.  He
was last granted a security clearance in 2014. (Exhibit 3, Section 25, and Exhibit 12) He
married  for  the  fourth  time  in  2017,  his  three  previous  marriages  having  ended  in
divorce. He has an adult child and an adult stepchild.
Applicant’s  educational  background   includes  an   associate   degree   awarded   in
2012   and   a   bachelor’s   degree   awarded   in  2014   from   the   same   university   in  State   #2.
Before   entering   the   university,  he   worked   in   State   #2   as   a   site   manager   during   2006-
2010. (Exhibit 3) He  was unemployed  during  the  period  of February  2010  to  May  2014,
while   attending   the   university   in  State   #2.   After   receiving   his  bachelor’s  degree,   he
worked   as  a   federal  civilian   employee   at  a   military   installation   in  State   #2   from   May
2014 to September 2017, when  he  began  his current job  in State #1.
Applicant’s employment history  includes  honorable  military  service.  He served  on
active  duty  in the  U.S.  Navy  for about 12  years during  1980-1992.  He  also served  in the
U.S.  Army   Reserve   for  about  five   years  during   1996-2001.  He  described   himself   as  a
100%-disabled   Veteran   with   traumatic  brain  injury,  memory   loss,   radiculopathy,
degenerative  disc disorder, shipwreck survivor, several gunshot wounds, post-traumatic
stress  disorder,  and   debilitating   migraines.  (Exhibit  A)  He  receives  disability
compensation  from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on  a monthly basis. (Exhibit
4 at 19)
The  SOR  alleges  a  history  of  financial  problems  or  difficulties  consisting  of  two
Chapter  13  bankruptcy  cases,  noncompliance  with  state  and  federal  tax  obligations,
four delinquent accounts  in amounts ranging from $145 to $20,988 for a total of about
$41,090,  and  a  past-due  mortgage  loan  in  the  amount  of  $34,907.  These  matters  are
discussed below.
1.   Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases—SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b.
Applicant’s
to  approximately
financial  problems  or  difficulties  date  back
November 2009, when  he  sought relief by  filing  a  Chapter 13  bankruptcy  case. (Exhibit
5) He  filed  the  case  in  a federal bankruptcy  court located  in  State  #2, where he  lived  at
the  time. The  bankruptcy  court confirmed  a  repayment plan  in  February  2010; the  plan
was completed  in  May  2014; the  court  issued  an  order of  discharge  in June  2014;  and
the  case  was closed  in  July  2014.  (Exhibit 5) Applicant did not  recall  the necessity  of the
Chapter 13  bankruptcy  case  when  he  was interviewed  about the  topic during  an  August
2020  background  investigation. (Exhibit 4  at 15) Based  on  my  review  of  the  Chapter 13
bankruptcy  case  docket  text,  it appears a  refinance  of real property  (e.g.,  refinancing  a
mortgage loan) was involved in the case. (Exhibit 5)
Applicant filed  a  second  Chapter 13  bankruptcy  case  in November 2019. (Exhibit
6)  He   filed   the   case   in   a   federal   bankruptcy   court   located   in   his   state   of  current
residence,  State   #1.  It   does   not   appear  the   bankruptcy   court  confirmed   a   repayment
plan.  Applicant  explained  he  filed  the  case  per the  advice of legal counsel  in an  effort  to
avoid  losing   his  home,  because   he   had   fallen   behind   on   a   mortgage   loan   and   was
attempting  to  obtain  a  loan  modification  from  the  mortgage  lender.  (Exhibit A; Exhibit 4
at  15-16)   The   bankruptcy   court  dismissed   the   case   in  response   to   the   Chapter   13
Trustee’s motion to dismiss in August 2020.  The case was closed in  October 2020.
2.   Noncompliance with income-tax obligations—SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e.
The SOR alleges Applicant is in noncompliance with state income-tax obligations
to file tax returns, as required, for tax years 2011-2016, and that he owes back taxes in
the amount  of  about $8,616 for those  same tax years.  The  state tax authority is  State
#1,  where  he  has  worked  and  lived  since  about  late  2017.  Applicant  denied  the
allegations  in  his  answer  to  the  SOR.  In  their  brief,  Department  Counsel  relies  on  a
proof  of  claim  filed  by  the  State  #1  tax  authority  in  the  2019  Chapter  13  bankruptcy
case. (Brief at 3; Exhibit 7) The  December 2019 proof of claim asserts Applicant owes
individual income tax due to non-filing estimated at $1,436 per year for a total amount of
$8,616 for tax years 2011-2016. Note, there are no tax liens reflected in credit reports
from September 2021, March 2021, and July 2020. (Exhibits 8, 9, and 10)
As set forth above, Applicant lived in State #2 from 2006 to late 2017. He was an
unemployed  student  at  a  university  in  State  #2  during  2010-2014.  His  time  at  the
university occurred between  periods of employment in  State #2 during 2006-2010 and
2014-2017. Department Counsel acknowledged that Applicant “may have lived in [State
#2] for some portion of that time period,” but did not offer an argument to establish that
Applicant was required to file income tax returns and pay income tax in a state in which
he did not reside during the relevant tax years. Without substantial evidence Applicant
was  a  bona  fide  part-year  or  nonresident  taxpayer  in  State  #1,  it  is  difficult  to  find  he
was required by law to file tax returns and pay income tax in State #1 for the tax years
in question. Given the conflicting evidence here, the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d
are unproven.
The allegation in SOR ¶ 1.e concerns back taxes owed to the IRS in the amount
of $6,605 for tax years 2019 and 2020. Applicant admitted this allegation, in part, in his
answer  to  the  SOR.  He  also  explained  he  was  on  a  payment  plan.  He  submitted
documentation from  the IRS showing the following: (1)  sometime in 2020,  he entered
into  an  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS  agreeing  to  make  monthly  payments;  (2)
during  September  2020  to  September  2021,  he  made  ten  installment  payments  for  a
total of $2,009, which were applied to tax year 2019; (3) in May 2021, the IRS notified
Applicant that his monthly payment was increasing to $250 beginning in July 2021; (4)
in August 2021, the IRS notified Applicant that his installment agreement was revised to
include  the  balance  owed  for  tax  year  2020  with  the  monthly  payment  remaining
unchanged;  and  (5)  as  of  September  2021,  he  owed  $195  in  back  taxes  for  tax  year
2019 and $4,054 in back taxes for tax year 2020. (Exhibits C, D, E, and 4 at 5-7) The
same  documents  show  he  last  made  a  payment  of  $250  in  July  2021.  He  did  not
provide documentation of payments made since July 2021.
3.   Four delinquent accounts—SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i.
The   SOR  alleges  Applicant  has  four  delinquent  accounts  in  amounts  ranging
from  $145  to  $20,988  for a  total of  about $41,090.  Two  are collection  accounts  and  two
are charged-off  accounts.  Applicant admitted  owing  a  $20,988  charged-off  account and
denied  the  three  other  matters in  his  answer to  the  SOR.  The  four delinquent  accounts
are established  by  credit reports from September 2021  and  March 2021. (Exhibits 8  and
9) Applicant did not provide  documentary  proof  that any  of  the  four accounts were paid,
settled, in  a repayment plan, disputed, cancelled, forgiven, or otherwise resolved.
4.   Past-due mortgage  loan—SOR ¶ 1.j.
The  allegation  here  concerns  a  past-due  mortgage  loan  in  the  amount  of
$34,907. It was mentioned above during discussion of the 2019 Chapter 13 bankruptcy
case. Applicant admitted having the mortgage loan but explained he was no longer past
due  in  his  answer  to  the  SOR.  He  explained  he  fell  behind  on  his  mortgage  loan
payments  after  his  spouse  was  injured  on  the  job  and  was  unable  to  return  to
employment. (Exhibit A) He filed the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case per the advice of his
attorney to prevent a foreclosure. Over a lengthy period of time, Applicant sought a loan
modification from his mortgage lender. He succeeded in that endeavor in August 2021.
As  proof,  he  submitted  page  1  of  6  pages  of  the  August  23,  2021  loan  modification
agreement.  (Exhibit  F)  He  did  not  submit  documentation  of  monthly  mortgage  loan
payments  since  August  2021.  Nor  did  he  submit  a  recent  account  statement  for  the
mortgage  loan.  The  most  recent  credit  report  from  September  2021  shows  the
mortgage loan (a VA real estate mortgage) was included in the Chapter 13 bankruptcy
case, the account has a balance of $0, and is past due in the amount of $0. (Exhibit 8 at
2)
Concerning  his  overall  finances,  Applicant  provided  a  pay  statement  from
February  2021  that  reflects  a  biweekly  base  rate  of  $2,724,  which  is  about  $70,000
annually.  (Exhibit  11  at  5)  Note,  there  are  no  tax  liens,  garnishments,  or  similar
withholdings reflected in the pay statement. It does reflect a deduction of about $65 for
an  unspecified  loan.  During  his  background  investigation,  Applicant  stated  that  he
receives monthly disability compensation from the VA in amounts ranging from $1,531
to $1,884. (Exhibit 4 at 19) At the high end, that is $22,608 in annual tax-free income; at
the low end it’s $18,372.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3
The  DOHA  Appeal  Board  has  followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s
findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the  substantial-evidence  standard.4  Substantial
evidence means “evidence that a reasonable mind could accept as adequate to support
a conclusion; evidence beyond a scintilla.”5 Substantial evidence is a lesser burden than
both  clear  and  convincing  evidence  and  preponderance  of  the  evidence,  the  latter  of
which  is  the  standard  applied  in  most  civil  trials.  It  is  also  a  far  lesser  burden  than
evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, the norm for criminal trials.
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.6  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.7

‘right’  to a security  clearance”); Duane v. Department  of Defense, 275 F.3d  988,  994 (10th  Cir. 2002)  (no
right to a security clearance).

Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability   to   live   within  one’s  means,  satisfy   debts,   and   meet
financial  obligations  may   indicate   poor  self-control,  lack  of   judgment,   or
unwillingness  to   abide   by   rules   and   regulations,   all   of  which  can   raise
questions  about  an   individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and   ability   to
protect classified  or sensitive  information. . ..
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying
conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶  19(a) inability to satisfy debts;
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and
AG ¶  19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local
income tax returns, or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income
tax as required.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  or difficulties  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.
With that said, his financial problems are not as problematic as they may appear in the
SOR.  To  his  credit,  he  completed  the  court-ordered  repayment  plan  for  the  2009
Chapter  13  bankruptcy  case,  which  ended  with  a  discharge  in  2014.  The  relatively
recent 2019 Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was due to the past-due mortgage loan, which
is  a  common  legal  strategy  to  prevent  foreclosure.  The  allegations  of  noncompliance
with  the  State  #1  tax  authority  are  unproven.  He  reduced  the  amount  of  back  taxes
owed  to  the  IRS  from  $6,605  to  $4,250  as  of  September  2021,  a  reduction  of  about
36%.  Moreover,  Applicant  succeeded  in  obtaining a  loan modification  of  the  mortgage
loan, although he could have done more to document that fact. What’s remaining is not
minor,  however,  as  there  are  four  unresolved  delinquent  accounts  for  more  than
$40,000.  It  appears  he  has  taken  little  to  no  remedial  action  on  those  debts.  The
disqualifying conditions noted above apply.
I  also  considered  the  mitigating  conditions  as  set  forth  in  AG  ¶  20.  Applicant
receives  credit  for  his  efforts  to  repay  back  taxes  owed  to  the  IRS  via  an  installment
payment  agreement.  He  reduced  the  amount  owed  by  about  36%,  a  substantial
reduction. See AG ¶ 20(d) and AG ¶ 20(g) He is also due credit for his sustained efforts
to  obtain  a  loan  modification  for  his  past-due  mortgage  loan.  See  AG  ¶  20(d)  And  he
receives credit in mitigation because of the loss of his spouse’s income due  to  a  work-
related injury. Applicant claimed the loss of income led to the  past-due mortgage loan,
which  resulted  in  the  most  recent  bankruptcy  case.  See  AG  ¶  20(b)  All  these  matters
weigh in his favor.
Nevertheless,  the  four  delinquent  accounts  for  more  than  $40,000  are  wholly
unresolved.  Likewise,  there  are  no  prospects  that  Applicant  will  take  steps  to  resolve
them in the near future. What’s missing here is a track record of repayment of those four
delinquent accounts. So despite  his efforts, Applicant has too much wholly unresolved
delinquent  debt  to  justify  a  favorable  clearance  decision.  Accordingly,  the  Guideline  F
matter is decided against Applicant.
Following Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to  protect
classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence
as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. In doing so, I gave
Applicant substantial credit for his years of honorable military service and for his status
as a 100%-disabled Veteran, for which I have respect and appreciation. I conclude that
he  has  not  met  his  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  show  that  it  is  clearly  consistent
with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph  1, Guideline  F:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs  1.a  –  1.e:
Subparagraphs 1.f –  1.i:
Subparagraph  1.j:
For Applicant
Against Applicant
For Applicant
Conclusion
It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for
access to classified information. National security eligibility is denied.
