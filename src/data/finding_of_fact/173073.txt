Applicant,  33,  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  federal  contracting
company, since June 2020. He completed a security clearance application in May 2020,
disclosing  three  delinquent  accounts.  The  ensuing  background  investigation  revealed
additional  delinquent  accounts.  The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  four
creditors for approximately $28,405. (GE 3, AE A)
Applicant’s  financial  problems  began  after  he  graduated  from  college  in  May
2017.  Initially,  Applicant  financed  his  education  with  student  loans.  He  stopped
attending  college  in  2012.  When  he  returned  to  college  between  2014  and  2017,  he
attended classes each spring semester, working construction jobs each summer and fall
semester  to  save  money  for  tuition.  After  graduation,  Applicant  continued  to  work
construction  jobs  until  January  2018.  He  was  then  unemployed  for  five  months.  He
returned  to  construction  work  in  June  2018,  working  laborer  or  construction  foreman
positions  until  he  secured  his  first  engineering  job  in  February  2019.  He  secured  his
current position, a better paying one, in June 2020. (GE 3, AE A)
The  accounts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  ($13,632)  and  1.c  ($3,446) are  for private
student loans originated by the university he attended. He mistakenly thought these two
loans  were  consolidated  into  his  federal  loans.  Upon  learning  that  they  were  not,  he
attempted to set up a payment plan in October 2019 for $100 per month. He could not
maintain  the  plan  because  he  was  unemployed.  He  contacted  the  university  again  in
August 2020 to set up a payment plan, and learned that his loans were transferred to a
law firm for collection. He setup a payment plan with the law firm in June 2021, agreeing
to  make  a  down  payment  of  $1,500  followed  by  $300  each  month.  He  paid  the  down
payment  in  June  2021  and  provided  evidence  with  his  September  2021  FORM
response that he made the July and August payments. (GE 2, AE B)
The account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b ($10,837) is for a credit card that he used for
emergencies  and  living  expenses.  Applicant  has  made  72  of  96  payments  on  his
established payment plan, totaling $3,600. The two remaining debts, SOR ¶¶ 1.d ($300)
and 1.e ($160) were resolved by Applicant in June 2021 and July 2020, respectively. In
addition  to  the  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR,  Applicant  also  paid  the  charged-off  $2,822
credit card debt he disclosed on his security clearance application. (GE 2,4,7)
Applicant  believes  that  with  his  current  job,  he  is  financially  secure.  The  most
recent  credit  report  in  the  record,  dated  September  2021,  shows  no  new  delinquent
accounts and that he is living within his financial means. (GE 4, AE A)
