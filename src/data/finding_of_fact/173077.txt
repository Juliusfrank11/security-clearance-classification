Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since about July 2021. His current employer hired him when it was
awarded the government contract of his previous employer for whom he worked since
March  2018.  There  has  been  no  interruption  in  his  employment  with  a  defense
contractor since March 2018. He was granted an interim security clearance in 2018. He
has an associate’s degree. He has never been married and has no children. (Transcript

Applicant has a significant history of criminal offenses, including several alcohol-
related offenses. In about January 2008, he was charged with driving with a suspended
driver’s license after being pulled over for speeding. His driver’s license was suspended
because  he  had  let  his  insurance  coverage  lapse.  In  about  August  2008,  he  failed  to
appear  for  his  court  date  for  driving  on  a  suspended  license  and  was  charged  with
failure  to  appear.  In  September  2009,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  driving  on  a  suspended
license, speeding, and failure to appear and was  placed on probation before judgment
(PBJ).  He  completed about  three  to  six months  of  probation  successfully  and  paid  his
required  fines  and  court fees.  (Tr. at  34-36, Applicant’s  response  to  SOR;  GE  1,  2,  4,
19)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  December  2009  in  State  A  and  charged  with  driving
under  the  influence  (DUI),  after  driving  home  from  a  bar  despite  knowing  he  was
intoxicated. He had a .13 blood alcohol content (BAC) at the time of his arrest. He spent
the night in jail. As it was Applicant’s first DUI, these charges against him were dropped.
(Tr. at 36-37; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 19)
About two months later, in February 2010, Applicant was arrested in State A and
charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI). He had been drinking at a bar and decided
to drive home despite knowing that he was intoxicated. He had a .19 BAC at the time of
his arrest. He spent one or two nights in jail. In October 2010, he pleaded guilty and was
sentenced to 60 days in jail, all suspended. His driver’s license  was suspended  for six
months, and he had to  pay fines and complete 24 hours of  community service.  (Tr. at
37-42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 5, 19)
Applicant had enlisted in  the  U.S. Navy  in about February  2010. As a  result of his
February  2010  DWI, Applicant’s accession  to  the  Navy  was declined.1  (Tr. 31, 59;  GE  2,
3, 19)
In  May 2010, Applicant  was  charged with  driving  with  a  suspended license.  His
license  had  been  administratively  suspended  as  a  result  of  his  February  2010  DWI
charge.  He  pleaded  guilty  and  received  PBJ  as  a  result  of  this  charge.  (Tr.  at  41-43;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 5, 6, 19)
In November 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI and Failure to
Stop After Accident Involving Damage to Attended Vehicle/Property. Prior to his arrest,
Applicant  had been drinking alone at  home for three  to four hours and had  consumed
about  two  bottles  of  wine.  He  decided  to  drive  despite  knowing  he  was  impaired
because he had to go to work. On his way to work, he collided with a pick-up truck, left
the  scene  of  the  accident,  and  drove  the  additional  two  to  three  miles  to  work  at  a
restaurant where he was employed  as a bartender. While investigating the hit and run
involving  the  aforementioned  pick-up  truck,  the  police  determined  that  Applicant  was
responsible and arrested him at work. Applicant had a .21 BAC when he was arrested.
He pleaded guilty to both charges and was sentenced to 365 days in jail with all but 45
days  suspended,  probation  for  three  years,  and  two  months  of  alcohol  classes.  He
claimed  that  he  completed  all  the  requirements  of  his  sentence.  In  his  January  2018
subject interview (SI), he did not tell his investigator about the hit and run aspect of his
arrest.  He  only  discussed  a  version  of  events  involving  the  DWI  that  did  not  include
colliding with another vehicle. (Tr. at 43-49; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 7, 8,
19, 20)
Applicant  attended  court-ordered alcohol classes from  February 2013  until April
2013.  Prior  to  attending  these  court-ordered  classes,  he  voluntarily  began  attending
some  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  meetings.  He  attended  AA  meetings  from  January
2013 until about July 2013. He completed a couple of the AA steps but did not have a
sponsor. (Tr. 57-58; GE 19)
In late June 2017, Applicant was arrested in State A and charged with intoxicated
endangerment. Applicant was  walking back to  the location where he  was  staying after
drinking  at  a  bar  for  seven  or  eight  hours.  A  bouncer  at  the  bar  where  Applicant  had
been drinking alerted the police that Applicant had too much to drink, so police  began
following him. Applicant tried to steal a bike that was locked to a bench and pushed it
over when he realized he could not take it. Police lost him for a couple of minutes, but
then relocated him when they saw him vomiting in a bush. When he noticed police were
following him, Applicant ran to evade them, but they apprehended him. Applicant spent
the  night  in  jail.  Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to  intoxicated  endangerment  in  August  2017.

1  Any  adverse  information  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  such  as  Applicant’s  issues  with  joining  the  Navy,
cannot  be  used  for  disqualification  purposes.  It  may  be  considered  when  assessing  Applicant’s
rehabilitation, in the application of mitigating conditions, and for the whole-person analysis.
In November 2017, Applicant was charged with Failure to Control Vehicle Speed
on  a  Highway  to  Avoid  Collision  after  he  was  involved  in  a  car  accident.  In  January
2018,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  this  charge  and  prepaid  a  fine.  The  vehicle  that  he  was
driving was  totaled as a  result of  this accident.  (Tr. 49-50,  52; Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 10)
In  March  2018,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Driver  Using  Hands  to  Use  Hand-
Held  Telephone  while  Motor  Vehicle  was  in  Motion.  This  charge  resulted  from  his
involvement in an accident because he was looking at his mobile phone and rear-ended
another vehicle.  He pleaded  guilty and paid a fine.  (Tr.  49-52;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 11)
In  March  2020,  Applicant  was  cited  for speeding  when  he  was  caught  traveling
64  mph  in  a  55  mph  zone.  He  pleaded  guilty  and  paid  a  fine.  (Tr.  52-53;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 12)
Sometime in 2021, Applicant was cited for speeding after a speed camera caught
him exceeding the speed limit. He pleaded guilty and paid a fine online. (Tr. 53-54)
Applicant  admitted   that  his  drinking   has   caused   problems  with   his  family,  his
finances, and  his health.  Applicant has a  paternal history  of   kidney  disease. Beginning
when  he  was about  25  years  old  in 2012,  Applicant showed  symptoms of  chronic  kidney
disease.   As  early   as  January   2018,  he   recognized   that  his  alcohol  consumption   had
exacerbated  his kidney  disease.  However, he  continued  to  consume  alcohol to  excess,
acknowledging  that,  at  that time, he  was consuming  four to  five  drinks once  or twice per
month and  drinking to the point of intoxication about once every two months.  (Tr. 29, 55-
56; GE 2, 3, 19; AE B, C)
As a result of a referral by the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudication
Facility  (DOD  CAF),  in  February  2021,  with  a  follow-up  in  June  2021,  Applicant
underwent a psychological evaluation by a licensed clinical psychologist (Psychologist).
The Psychologist was contracted by the DOD CAF. In order to make her psychological
evaluation,  the  Psychologist  reviewed  background  information  submitted  by  the  DOD
CAF,  the  results  of  a  clinical  interview,  testing  observations,  and  the  results  of  the
Personality Assessment Inventory. (Tr. 59; GE 2, 3)
Based  upon  these  measuring  tools,  the  Psychologist  diagnosed  Applicant  with
alcohol  use  disorder  (moderate-severe).  She  found  the  risk  of  future  alcohol-related
incidents to be moderate with a guarded prognosis. She noted her concern that, despite
all  of  the  adverse  effects  alcohol  has  had  on  him,  Applicant  continued  to  consume  it
without  undergoing  any  alcohol-related  treatment.  She  also  noted  that,  in  about  2019,
Applicant’s doctor recommended that he abstain from alcohol entirely. (Tr. 59; GE 2, 3)
Applicant claimed that, in the Fall of 2021, he turned over a new leaf and stopped
drinking. This decision was spurred partly by knowing that his kidneys were “basically all
the  way  gone,”  and  a  May  2021  medical  emergency  that  put  him  in  the  hospital  after
“throwing up 10 pints of blood” and nearly dying. He also credits his decision to change
his  lifestyle  on  a  subsequent  medical  issue  in  about  July  2021  when  his  right  lung
collapsed. He testified that he has not had a drink since Fall 2021, and that he plans to
continue to abstain from alcohol entirely. (Tr. 29, 55-56; GE 2, 3, 19; AE B, C)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  32  delinquent  debts  totaling  approximately
23,400.  Many  of  these  delinquent  debts  are  medical  debts  resulting  from  Applicant’s
aforementioned  chronic  kidney  issues.  However,  Applicant  also  has  other  debts,  such
as a delinquent credit-card debt, a delinquent debt to State A, a delinquent student-loan
debt, and a delinquent telecommunications debt. Applicant attributed his financial issues
to  his  youth,  his  disorganization,  and  a  lack  of  income.  He  also  attributed  them  to  his
past and ongoing health conditions. He has been covered by health insurance through
his employer as of March 2018 at the latest. (TR. 63-83, 110-121; Applicant’s response
to SOR; GE 13-19; AE A-D)
The  $1,916  judgment  entered  in  2011  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  4.a  has  not  been
resolved. Applicant claimed that he has paid this debt through garnishments, however,
he did not provide any documentation establishing it was paid. He testified that he may
have had documentation showing the debt was paid at one time, but he no longer does.
(Tr. 63-65; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 13)
The $848 medical judgment entered in 2013 alleged in SOR ¶ 4.b has not been
resolved. Applicant believes that he paid this  debt because he has not heard from the
creditor  or  any  collection  agencies  about  the  debt.  However,  he  did  not  provide  any
documentation  establishing  that  it  was  paid.  (Tr.  65-68;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR;
GE 14, 19)
The $2,461 judgment entered in 2017 in favor of State A alleged in ¶ 4.c has not
been  resolved.  Applicant  does  not  know  the  nature  of  this  debt.  He  presented  no
evidence  that  he  has  made  a  payment,  disputed  this  debt,  offered  or  negotiated  a
payment  agreement,  or  taken  any  significant  actions  to  resolve  this  debt.  (Tr.  68-70;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 16; AE C)
The $9,231 educational loan judgment entered in 2018 alleged in ¶ 4.d has not
been resolved. Applicant presented no evidence that he has made a payment, disputed
this debt, offered or negotiated a payment agreement, or taken any significant actions to
resolve this debt. (Tr. 70-71; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 15)
The  $119  telecommunications  debt  alleged  in  ¶  4.i  has  not  been  resolved.
Applicant  testified  that  he  paid  this  debt  sometime  in  2019  but  did  not  provide  any
documentation  establishing  it  was  paid.  The  debt  appears  on  Applicant’s  2018  credit
report but not  on  his 2021  credit  report.  (Tr. 76; Applicant’s  response  to  SOR; GE  17,
19)
The  remainder  of  Applicant’s  delinquent  debts  listed  in  the  SOR  are  medical
debts  (¶¶  4.e  through  4.h,  ¶¶  4.j  through  4.aa,  and  ¶¶  4.cc  through  4.gg).  Applicant
initially testified that he has paid only the debts listed in ¶¶ 4.e, 4.f, 4.h, 4.n, and 4.p. He
provided  documentation  establishing  that  the  debts  listed  in  ¶¶  4.e,  4.h,  and  4.p  were
paid in March and April 2022. The debts in ¶¶ 4.e, 4.h, and 4.p have been resolved. (Tr.
76-83; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 17-19; AE A, B)
Applicant  and  his mother  also testified  that they  believe  that most of  the  medical
debts  listed  in  SOR  ¶  4  have  been  paid.  Applicant  claimed  that he  could  not  match  up
his payment receipts  with  the  debts  listed  in  the  SOR because  creditors  combined  the
debts  into   one   statement.   He  was  unable   to   identify   which  documents  he   provided
corroborated  the  payments  he  alleged  he  made  on  the  remaining  SOR debts.  Many  of
Applicant’s  documents   relate   to   medical  services  that  were  provided   to   him   in   March
2021  and  later.  The  SOR debts listed  in  ¶¶  4.j through  4.aa  and  4.cc through  4.gg  are
all  contained  in  the  April 2018  credit report,  so  those  debts were incurred  prior to  March
2021.  As evidenced  by  information  in the  July  2021  credit report, the  SOR debts listed
in ¶¶  4.f  and  4.g  were also incurred  prior to  March 2021.  Any  of  Applicant’s documents
purporting   to   show   payments  for  medical  services  provided   to   him   after  March   2021
cannot  show   payments  for  the   debts  listed   in   ¶¶  4.f,   4.g,   4.j  through   4.o,  4.q   through
4.aa,  and  4.cc through  4.gg.  (Tr. 76-83,108-121; Applicant’s response  to  SOR; GE  17-
19; AE A-D)
Applicant’s  documents  show  that  he  has  made  some  payments  on  medical
debts,  but  he  has  failed  to  show  that  he  has  made  payments  on  the  aforementioned
SOR  debts.  Applicant  largely  began  his  efforts  to  pay  these  medical  debts  at  the
beginning  of  2022.  Most  of  the funds  that  he  used  to  pay  these  debts  were  gifts  from
friends and family, often raised through his mother’s fundraising efforts in February and
March  2022.  As  Applicant  did  not  provide  documentation  corroborating  his  alleged
payments, the debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 4.f, 4.g, 4.j through 4.aa and 4.cc through 4.gg are
unresolved. (Tr. 76-83,108-121; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 17-19; AE A-D)
Applicant testified that, at some time between 2005 and 2008, his aunt gave her
permission to add her name to his loan application from Bank A for a student loan. He
testified that  his aunt  told  him  she  would  be responsible for paying  back  this debt.  He
applied for this loan in his name and added his aunt as a co-signor. The debt became
delinquent by 2017 and Bank A filed a lawsuit against Applicant and his aunt to recover
the  balance. Applicant’s aunt  hired  an  attorney  and  defended  herself against Bank  A’s
lawsuit, claiming that Applicant had forged her signature to the loan application without
her permission. Bank A dismissed  Applicant’s aunt from  the  lawsuit with  prejudice,  but
obtained a judgment against Applicant as described in SOR ¶ 4.d.  (Tr. 70-76, 99-100;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 15, 17, 22, 23)
Applicant  claimed  that  his  aunt  changed  her  mind  about  their  agreement  with
respect to this loan years after he applied for it because she needed money.  Applicant
has  no  documentation  evidencing  his  aunt’s  consent  to  sign  her  name  to  loan
applications, but claimed that his mother is aware of the arrangement. Applicant’s aunt
passed away in late 2018. (Tr. 70-76, 99-100; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 15, 17,
22, 23)
In  order  to  assist  him  with  his  debts  and  investments,  Applicant  consulted  a
financial advisor beginning in February 2021 that his mother recommended. He did not
provide  evidence  as  to  what  his  financial  advisor  has  done  to  assist  him  with  his
finances. (Tr. 92-94)
As  a  result  of  his  chronic  kidney  disease,  Applicant  is  in  need  of  a  kidney
transplant  and  is  on  a  kidney  donor  list.  However,  he  claimed  that  in  order  to  be
approved for a transplant, he has to improve his credit-to-debt ratio. Applicant plans to
continue to pay down his delinquent debts in order to improve this ratio.  He also plans
to  continue  his  education  and  is  eight  to  ten  classes  shy  of  earning  his  bachelor’s
degree.  He  provided  a  transcript  from  his  school  showing  that  he  has  earned  good
grades. (Tr. 32-33, 80, 118-119; AE A-D)
