Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i and 1.j.
He partially admits SOR ¶ 1.o and denies ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m.1.n, 1.p and 1.q. After
a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 54 years old. He was married from 1987 to 1989 and from 1990 to
February 2020. He has four adult children. In his government interrogatories he stated he
began working for a federal contractor in August 2020. (Items 3, 4)
In  Applicant’s  July  2020  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  he  disclosed  he
failed to timely file his 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns. He attributed this to his
ex-wife’s failure to timely file the returns when he was working overseas in 2017 and 2018.
He estimated he owed $40 for each tax year and his accountant was making payment
arrangements with the IRS. He also attributed his other financial problems to his ex-wife
who did not pay the bills while he was overseas and instead was using their money for
other purposes. They are now divorced. (Items 2, 3)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  the  federal  government  for
delinquent taxes of approximately $26,439 for tax years 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. In
his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  attributes  his  tax  debts  due  to  malfeasance  by  his
accountant  in  approximately  2008,  and  when  his  wife  failed  to  timely  file  their  federal
income tax returns for 2017 and 2018. He stated that he owed federal income taxes in
2008 because his accountant did not take care of his taxes. He believed he owed about
$3,000, but then found out it was $10,000. He said he made payment arrangements with
the IRS, and that he and his wife “would chip away at the taxes but every year I had to
roll the amount over.” He said he had been working with the IRS since 2009 and when he
went overseas his ex-wife skipped making payments and then stopped. (Items 2, 3)
In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR  and  interrogatory  response,  he  provided
documents from his current accountant stating that as of October 2021, Applicant owes
$26,479 for tax years 2015 through 2018. His accountant was in communication with the
IRS to set up a recurring monthly payment. Applicant has been making payments of $380
to the IRS since January 2021, and his accountant says he has satisfied his 2015 federal
income  tax  debt.  Applicant’s  federal  tax  transcript  from  August  2021  shows  a  balance
owed of $720. Presumably his additional payments would have satisfied the balance for
tax  year  2015.  In  September  2021,  Applicant  submitted  a  request  for  an  installment
agreement to the IRS for monthly payments of  $380  for tax years 2015 through 2018.
There is no documentation to show the IRS has agreed to an installment agreement with
the proposed payment amount. Other tax years’ transcripts show inconsistent payments
toward tax debts owed for tax years that were not alleged in the SOR. (Items 2, 4, 8)
I have not considered any derogatory evidence that was not alleged  in the SOR
for  disqualifying  purposes.  I  may  consider  this  information  when  making  a  credibility
determination,  in  the  application  of  mitigating  conditions,  and  in  my  whole-person
analysis.
Applicant provided a document from the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.q verifying that he is
not  responsible for this  debt and  it  will be  removed from  his credit  report. This debt  is
resolved. (Item 2)
Applicant provided a receipt to show he made a $50 payment to a creditor, but it
is unclear which creditor on the SOR this payment applies to. (Item 2)
Applicant denies  the medical debts alleged  in SOR ¶¶ 1.b  ($367),  1.k ($79), 1.l
($77), 1.m ($39), 1.n ($33) and 1.p ($250). He stated he was unable to determine their
origin. He did not provide any information as to what actions he took to dispute the debts.
He indicated they may belong to his son, but did not provide information as to whether he
contacted his son to resolve them. The debts are listed on his credit reports. These debts
are unresolved.
In  Applicant’s SOR answer he  states the debt  in SOR  ¶ 1.c ($2,251)  originated
from a rental agreement and a dispute he has with the landlord. He said he is trying to
resolve  it.  He  did  not  provide  any  documents  or  information  regarding  efforts  he  has
made. It is unresolved.
Applicant admits owing  the  debts  in SOR ¶¶  1.d  ($1608),  1.e  ($947), 1.f ($3,202),
1.h  ($807),  1.i ($1,275), 1.j $5,571),  and  1.o  ($1,100). He stated  in his SOR answer that
he  was making  $100  payments toward the  debt in SOR ¶  1.e. He did not  provide  evidence
to substantiate his payments  or actions  he  may be taking to resolve  any  of  these  alleged
debts. (Item  2)
Applicant partially admitted the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g ($39,516). He stated in his SOR
answer that this debt is for two car loans. He said he is paying a portion of the debt based
on the vehicle he has, and that his ex-wife had the other vehicle that was financed and it
was repossessed. Applicant did not provide any documentation to substantiate that he is
not responsible for the whole amount or that he is making payments on the amount he
believes he owes. He did not provide a copy of a divorce settlement which reflects his ex-
wife would be responsible for this portion of the loan. (Items 5, 6, 7)
Credit reports from July 2020, March 2021, and September 2021 substantiate the
delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are individual accounts or joint accounts belonging
to Applicant. (Items 5, 6, 7)
Applicant stated in his SOR answer that he is taking care of his finances as he is
financially able. He said he has a payment agreement with the IRS and for his medical
bills.  He  is  paying  down  his  delinquent  debts.  He  stated  that  prior  to  being  employed
overseas he was an active participant in community activities with the Rotary Club, fire
department and high school, and was considered a person in good standing. (Item 2)
