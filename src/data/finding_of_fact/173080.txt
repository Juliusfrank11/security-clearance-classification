Applicant admitted some of the SOR allegations (¶¶ 1.a, 1.c) and denied others
(¶¶ 1.b, 1.d-1.f). His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of
the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 37 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since February
2020,  as  a  materials  handler.  From  2017  to  2020,  he  worked  non-government  private
sector jobs. He was unemployed from May 2016 to March 2017 and from March 2013 to
September 2014. He is a high school graduate and has taken some college courses. He
has  never  married  but  has  cohabitated  since  May  2019.  He  has  no  children.  He  is
seeking his first security clearance. (Items 3-4).
The SOR alleged Applicant owed four delinquent accounts totaling approximately
$14,996.  (¶¶  1.a-1.d)  Applicant  admitted  owing  these  debts  in  his  May  2020  security
clearance application (SCA) and in his August 2020 personal subject interview (PSI) by
a  defense  investigator.  An  August  2020  credit  report  also  lists  all  four  debts  as
delinquent.  In  his answer to  the SOR,  he admitted owing two  of  the debts and  denied
owing  the  other  two  without  giving  a  further  explanation.  The  SOR  also  alleged
Applicant  failed  to file his  2013  through  2019  federal and  state  income  tax  returns,  as
required  (¶¶  1.e-1.f).  Applicant  admitted,  during  his  PSI,  failing  to  file  his  federal  and
state income tax returns for years 2013, 2017, 2018, and 2019. He further explained he
did  not  file  federal  or  state  income  tax  returns  for  years  2014-2016  because  he  had
insufficient income to require him to file. (Items 3-5)
Applicant claims his delinquent debts were caused by his unemployment in 2013
that  resulted  in  financial  hardship.  He  did  not  reach  out  to  his  creditors  at  the  time  to
resolve the debts because he was financially unable to do so. During his PSI, he stated
that  he  intended  to  settle  these  debts  because  he  now had  a  steady  job.  He  failed  to
produce documentary evidence showing that he has made any payments toward these
debts,  or  established  a  payment  or  settlement  plan  with  the  creditors.  His  four
delinquent debts are unresolved. (Items 2, 4-5)
Applicant  claims  that  he  has  filed  all  his  federal  and  state  tax  returns  for  years
2017-2020  (year  2020  is  not  alleged  in  the  SOR),  which  are  the  only  years  he  had
taxable  income.  He  further  claims  these  returns  were  filed  in  March  or  April  2021.  He
failed to provide documentation supporting any of these assertions. (Item 4)
Applicant  did  not  provided  information  about  his  current  budget.  There  is  no
evidence available showing that he sought any financial counseling. (Items 1-6)
