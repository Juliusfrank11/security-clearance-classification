In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted parts of the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a
through 1.c, and he denied other parts of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) He also provided
mitigating information. (Id.)  His  admissions are  accepted as findings  of fact.  Additional
findings follow.
Applicant  is  37-year-old  senior  logistician.  (Tr.  6;  GE  1)  In  2006,  he  received  a
bachelor’s  degree  with  a  major  in  political  science,  and  in  2013,  he  was  awarded  a
master’s degree in data and supply chain management. (Tr. 7; GE 1) He served on active
duty for nine years in the Marine Corps, and then continued in the Marine Corps Reserve.
(Tr. 7-8) He is currently a major. (Tr. 8, 34) In 2006, he married, and his four children are
ages six, seven, eight, and ten. (Tr. 8-9)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s current  annual salary is $135,000, and  his spouse’s annual salary is
$155,000.  (Tr.  55)  He  has  an  additional  annual  income  of  about  $20,000  from  other
sources. (Tr. 55-56) He has substantial funds in the bank. (Tr. 56; AE C) From 2016 to
2022,  Applicant  and  his  spouse’s  gross  annual  income  averaged  from  $250,000  to
$300,000.  (Tr.  68)  He  estimated  his  net  worth  to  be  about  $650,000.  (Tr.  69)  His  net
monthly remainder is about $8,000. (Tr. 57) Several years ago, Applicant spent $42,000
in medical and legal expenses to adopt a child. (Tr. 25) The adoption expenses reduced
Applicant’s  available  funds.  Applicant’s  spouse  is  a  physician’s  assistant.  (Tr.  39)
Applicant and his spouse invested in several real estate investment properties over the
years.
In 2014, Applicant purchased a 10-acre lot and home in state M for $189,000 near
his  civilian  place  of  employment.  (Tr.  36-37)  Around  2014  to  2015,  he  spent  about
$180,000 to expand the house from 1,400 square feet to 3,500 square feet. (Tr. 16, 21,
25, 36, 38) He contracted with a construction company (CC) and agreed to pay $119,495
to CC to remodel his residence. (Tr. 38, 41) He had $80,000 cash, and he borrowed the
remainder on credit cards.
Applicant paid the final payment to the CC before the work was completed, and
then CC left without completion of the work. (Tr. 16, 41) CC closed their company, and
Applicant was unable to recover the funds paid to CC to complete the contract. (Tr. 16,
26,  42)  He  acknowledged  he  made  a  poor  decision  to  pay  CC  before  the  work  was
completed.  (Tr.  41)  He  paid  other  construction  companies  or  individuals  $57,000  to
complete  the  construction.  (Tr.  17,  26)  Completion  of  construction  was  necessary  to
enable Applicant’s family to live in the residence. (Tr. 17-18)
Applicant was unsuccessful in getting an insurance company to pay to complete
the construction or to recover the funds  paid to CC. (Tr. 26, 42-43) He did not provide
details  about  why  his  insurance  policy  might  pay  for  his  losses.  Applicant  was  unsure
about why he did not sue CC; however, it may have been an inability to collect from CC
and a reluctance to pay litigation costs when CC might not pay any judgment obtained
from a court. (Tr. 59) In 2021, Applicant sold the house and made a $130,000 profit after
the mortgage was paid. (Tr. 33)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  has  three  charged-off  debts  totaling  $44,471  as
follows: SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($3,136), 1.b ($21,335), and 1.c ($20,000).
In October 2015, Applicant hired a debt reduction company (DRC) to help resolve
five delinquent debts. (AE A) He paid DRC $580 monthly. (Tr. 52) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.a
originated from a store charge card, and the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b originated from a financial
credit card. (Tr. 46, 49) DRC wrote the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b; however, DRC
said  the  creditors  “did  not  respond  and  chose  not  to  pursue  the  accounts  so  now  the
statute of limitations has expired, and they cannot legally collect these debts. We will now
be  challenging  the  accounts  on  the  credit  report  to  be  removed.” (Tr.  46;  AE  A)  DRC
advised Applicant not to pay the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. (Tr. 49)
Applicant did  not  provide  the  correspondence  DRC sent  to  the  creditors in SOR ¶¶
1.a and 1.b. He did not receive an IRS Form  1099-C (cancellation  of indebtedness) from
the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. (Tr. 47)  He never made  an offer to settle the debt in
SOR ¶  1.b  because  DRC  was handling  the  settlement negotiations.  (Tr.  61-62) Applicant
did  not  indicate   that   DRC   ever offered   a   specific settlement amount  to   the   creditors in
SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b. (Tr. 63-64) He had  the  funds available to  pay  the  debt owed  to  SOR
¶   1.b   in   full   if   he   chose   to   do   so.  (Tr.  69-70)  Applicant  provided   a   February   17,  2022
TransUnion  credit report which did not include  the  delinquent debts in SOR ¶¶  1.a  and
1.b; however, his December 7, 2021 Equifax credit report lists the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b, but
not the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a. (GE 4 at 5, AE B)
Applicant said the three-year statute of limitations barred collection of the debts in
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b,  and  he  believed  the  debt  was  “no  longer  valid.”  (Tr.  32-33)  The
statute of limitations for a credit card debt in the state where his residence was located in
2015 and 2016 is five years. Applicant did not indicate the state with the three-year statute
of limitations or provide information about why that state would have jurisdiction over his
debts.
DRC said the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.c “chose not to respond and then charged off the
account  and  did  not  pursue  it  despite  our  attempts  and  it  is  now  past  the  statute  of
limitations and cannot legally be enforced.” (Id.) In 2015, the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.c issued
an  IRS  Form  1099-C  indicating  the  creditor  cancelled  a  debt  owed  by  Applicant  for
$18,093. (SOR response at 7) Applicant said the debt was “paid off in full per negotiated
settlement amount.” (SOR response at 3)  Actually, he paid the settlement amount, and
declared the $18,093 as income on his federal income tax return. (Tr. 61)
Applicant  explained  that  he  did  not  pay  the  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and  1.c
because CC should have repaid the funds Applicant borrowed and paid to CC to complete
work  that  was  not  performed.  (Tr. 53)  Applicant  wanted  DRC  to  convince  some  of  his
creditors to seek repayment from CC rather than from him. (Tr. 44) He was “under the
impression” from  DRC that  the  creditors could  seek repayment from CC and when the
creditors elected not to do so, Applicant elected not to repay the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.a
and 1.b. (Tr. 54)
Applicant said he paid the debts he believed to be legitimate, and he did not pay
the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b because he questioned their validity. (Tr. 60) Applicant
conceded that the lack of privity made enforcement by the creditors unlikely, that is, the
contract between Applicant and CC is only binding on Applicant and CC (the actual parties
to the contract), and creditors did not have a contractual basis to  enforce the contract.
(Tr. 65-66)
Two  non-SOR  creditors  responded  to  DRC’s  request  for  information,  and  DRC
settled both debts on Applicant’s behalf. (AE A) Applicant established payment plans for
some of his other debts. (Tr. 45-46) One non-SOR creditor obtained a judgment against
Applicant for $9,822. (Tr. 61) Applicant made $2,000 monthly payments required by the
judgment, and he resolved the debt. (Tr. 61)
Aside from the two debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, Applicant has excellent credit.
(Tr. 75; AE B) As to SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, he relied on the  DRC’s advice, which was to
allow  DRC  to  negotiate  settlement  of  his  debts.  (Tr.  75)  He  described  himself  as  an
honest, honorable, and trustworthy person. (Tr. 75)
