Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.j, and 1.l. He denied
the  SOR  allegation  in  ¶  1.k.  His  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  38  years  old.  He  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  2001  and  is  a
naturalized citizen. He enlisted in the military in 2001 and was medically discharged with
an honorable discharge in 2006. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2010 and a master’s
degree  in business  in 2015.  He married  in 2011 and  has  three small children. He  has
worked for a federal contractor since 2019. (Tr. 32-35)
The  SOR  alleges  10  delinquent  credit  cards  and  loans  totaling  approximately
$53,735.  He  cosigned  for  his  wife’s  student  loan  which  is  in  default  status.  The  last
payment was in November 2017. (SOR ¶ 1.a-$24,395). His mortgage was past due in the
amount  of  approximately  $71,887  (SOR  ¶  1.k).  These  debts  are  corroborated  by
Applicant’s admissions in his security clearance application (SCA), background interview,
government interrogatories, and credit reports from August 2019, January 2020, February
2021, and March 2022. (Tr. 72-74; GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
Applicant testified that he worked in industry and progressed in his career moving
up from a technician to a program manager, increasing his salary and responsibility along
the way. He wanted to own his own business and saw a business opportunity. He left his
job  in  approximately  July  2017  and  became  the  director  of  operations  in  a  start-up
business that he believed had excellent potential. He stated that when he left his stable
job he was making six figures and had medical benefits. He said he did not worry about
his  credit  and  not  paying  bills  because  entrepreneurship  is  about  taking  risks  and
gambling. He understood the risks. (Tr. 37; GE 1)
Applicant grew the company and was paid for about 8 to 10 months  as was his
medical insurance, but the business began to have money issues. He agreed to become
an  independent  contractor  employee  (1099)  to  help  with  the  cash  flow  issues.  The
business  started  having  more  problems,  and  Applicant  was  not  being  paid  or  was
receiving  partial  payments  or  late  payments.  He  started  missing  payments  on  his
mortgage and his other accounts. He paid for the necessities. He explained that a lot of
promises  were  made  by  the  owner  of  the  business  to  him,  but  he  attributed  it  to  the
entrepreneurial goal of the business. None of the promises were in writing. The business
stopped  paying  his  health  insurance  and  his  wife  was  pregnant  with  medical  issues.
Applicant became inundated with delinquent accounts. He stated that he is owed money
from the business, but the matter is in litigation. He estimated he is owed about $70,000-
$80,000. The owner promised when they win the case Applicant will be paid. The litigation
has been ongoing for about three years. He left the business and he was unemployed for
several months. He accepted a job in June 2019 that was an hour drive from his home.
His starting salary was about $100,000. He was promoted and his current salary is about
$135,000. Applicant also receives $1,882 monthly in disability benefits from Department
of Veterans Affairs (VA). (Tr. 35-45, 67, 69-71)
Applicant  explained  that  his  first  goal  was  to  make  sure  his  house  was  not
foreclosed. He was able to obtain a loan modification for his mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.k), which
is now current. He provided the supporting documents. (Tr. 46; SOR Answer)
Applicant testified that his wife does not work outside the home and he is the only
one  earning  an  income.  He  began  contacting  creditors  to  reach  settlements.  He
negotiated a settlement with the creditor in SOR  ¶ 1.d, which was approved in August
2021 (balance owed $7,434) to pay $2,230 over 18 months. He provided documentary
proof that he has made the requirement monthly payments since then. (Tr. 47-50, 68; GE
7; AE B, G, H).
Applicant reached a settlement agreement with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.c ($11,570)
to pay $5,785. He provided proof that he has made six monthly payments from November
2021 to March 2022. (Tr. 53-59, 74; AE F)
Applicant also provided proof that he has been making payments on another debt
since October 2021. He provided documents to substantiate the payments. The creditor
listed on his documents is not a collection agency and it is not one of the creditors alleged
in the SOR. (AE A, C, D)
At  his  hearing,  Applicant  stated  he  had  no  other  payment  agreements  with  the
remaining creditors alleged  in the SOR. Applicant’s  wife  has  credit  cards  that are also
delinquent.  They  deliberately  stopped  making  payments  on  the  credit  cards  so  the
creditors would agree to negotiate settlements. (Tr. 79-84; GE 7)
In  February  2022,  Applicant  started  a  side  business  so  he  could  increase  his
income.  It  is  a  delivery  service  for  a  major  company.  He  estimated  that  after  paying
expenses,  he  has  made  about  $2,500  since  February.  He  has  consulted  a  credit
counseling company, but did not hire it. He said he has told his creditors that he is paying
what he can afford. He said he stopped paying some credit cards because the creditors
would not negotiate a settlement unless he defaulted.  He obtained a $15,000 secured
loan in August 2021, so he could repay his mother and brother money they had lent him.
Applicant estimated he borrowed about $5,000 each from his mother and brother. He has
paid them back. Prior to the COVID pandemic, Applicant was paying his student loans.
Under the CARES Act the loans are deferred. He owes about $79,000. He will seek an
income-based payment plan when his student loans are no longer deferred. (Tr. 61-65,
75-79, 85, 87-89)
In the past, Applicant played in poker tournaments at casinos to relax. The entry
fees can be as high as $550. Sometimes his coworkers would give him the entry money.
In  2018,  he  played  a couple  of  tournaments  and  finished  high  enough  in  one  to  claim
about $11,000 in prize money. A couple of days later he had another big win. He stated
that in the past he has won more than he wagered. He said he would use his winnings to
celebrate by taking his family out for dinner and purchase items. He said he paid some
debts. Due to the pandemic he stopped going to the casino to play. He also said it is time
consuming and takes him away from his family. His last tournament was in 2019. He said
the most he has lost in one day was $2,000. (Tr. 99-105; GE 6)
Applicant does not have money saved in a pension plan or Individual Retirement
Account. He filed his 2020 federal tax return and owes about $2,000 due to an error made
in the return. He has not paid this tax debt. He believes he will be entitled to a refund on
his  2021  taxes,  and  it  will  be  applied  to  the  balance  he  owes.  He  stated  that  the  IRS
claims he owes $7,000, but he believes it is an error that will be corrected. Applicant does
not keep a budget, but intends to start one in the future. (Tr. 106-114)
