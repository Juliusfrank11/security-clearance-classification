Applicant  initially  denied  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  In  his  FORM  response,  he
amended his answer and admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.h, and partially
admitted and denied ¶ 1.k. He denied SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j.  After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 31 years old. He is not married and has no children. He served in the
Army Reserve from May 2010 until March 2018 and was honorably discharged. He lists
his  periods  of  employment  from  April  2014  to  September  2014;  October  2014  to  May
2015;  June  2015  to  October  2016;  and  January  2017  to  December  2019.  He  was
unemployed from October 2016 to January 2017.  He has been employed by a federal
contractor since December 2019. (Items 2, 3)
Applicant attended college at three different institutions from January 2009 to May
2010; January 2013 to December 2013; and April 2017 to December 2017, and earned
a technical certificate. He funded his education with student loans from the Department
of  Education  (DOE).  These  loans  are  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.h  and  total
approximately  $22,395.  Applicant  disclosed  on  his  January  2020  security  clearance
application (SCA) that the loans had been delinquent since approximately 2016. (Items
2, 3, 5, 6)
In  Applicant’s  response  to  the  FORM,  he  stated  that  his  student  loans  were
deferred  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  He  stated  that  he  began  a  rehabilitation
program  with  DOE  in  2021  and  is  making  payments  of  $150  a  month.  He  intends  to
continue  making  payments  until  the  loans  are  resolved.  He  provided  a  copy  of  a
repayment agreement dated June 21, 2021, showing the balance owed on his defaulted
student loans was $22,136. It also showed his first payment was due January 2022. A
document reflecting his account payments shows a payment of $132 made in November
2021 and another payment of $150 made in January 2022. A letter from DOE reflects that
he made six consecutive payments, which makes him eligible for DOE Title IV aid. He did
not provide evidence of when the payments were made and the amounts. (AE A, B, C)
Applicant disclosed in his January 2020 security clearance application (SCA) that
he failed to pay his 2017 federal income tax due to financial and personal hardship. He
estimated he owed about $2,800. He also disclosed that he failed to file his 2018 federal
income tax return due to financial hardship. He estimated he owed $3,000. His failure to
file was not alleged in the SOR. Regarding both his 2017 and 2018 tax issues, he stated
that he was working with a tax professional to resolve them and should have them taken
care of within the month. He stated: “At a minimum, we  are aiming towards a  payment
plan  for anything  owed.” (Item  3)  In his answer to  the SOR, he indicated he could not
confirm that he had a balance owed to the IRS. He amended this answer in his FORM
response explaining he understands he owes back taxes. He stated he has filed all of his
tax returns and begun making payments on the balance owed. He confirmed his tax debt
for tax year 2017 is $5,269 and 2018 is $6,375. He said he is making payments of at least
$300 a month, but will make payments of up to $500 a month when feasible. There is no
evidence  of  an  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS.  Applicant  provided  a  document
reflecting a payment of $500 was made to the IRS in November 2021 and another one of
$300 was made in January 2022. (AE F, G)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i ($5,761) is for a collection account for an apartment
that  Applicant  rented  with  two  roommates  and  they  broke  the  lease  in  2016.  One
roommate reneged leaving Applicant and his other roommate to pay the entire rent, which
they could not afford. Despite attempts to rectify the situation, including speaking with the
property  manager,  they  were  unable  to  pay  the  rent  and  were  evicted.  In  Applicant’s
January 2020 SCA, he indicated he was working with the collection agency to settle the
debt. He provided a letter from August 2020 showing he resolved the debt. (AE E, G)
SOR ¶ 1.j ($749) is a collection account from 2016. It was due to an overpayment
to Applicant by the Government. Applicant stated that he resolved the debt in either 2019
or  2020,  but  the  creditor  would  not  verify  the  date  the  debt  was  paid.  He  provided  a
document verifying the debt is resolved. (AE D, G)
Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to a period between 2015 and 2017. He
indicated  that  in  2015  he  was  earning  minimum  wage,  and  he  was  evicted  from  his
apartment. He was living in his friend’s car for eight months. The car was repossessed so
he had to live in a motel. He decided to move to seek new opportunities and while driving
cross  country  with  his  friend,  the  police  stopped  them.  His  stated  his  friend  had  a
marijuana vape pen and marijuana grinder in the car, and they were arrested. He paid a
lawyer to resolve the charge, which took over a year. He was unemployed from October
2016 to January 2017. (Item 2; AE G)
Applicant  began  living  with  his  father  in  approximately  October  2016  and  in
January 2017 he began a new job and was earning $15.50 an hour. In January 2020, he
began a new job and his annual salary was $68,000. In October 2021, he changed jobs
and his annual salary was $72,000. He recently moved to another job and he stated he
was making more money than he has ever before. He did not say the amount. Applicant
provided a copy of his budget, which reflects payments to the IRS and DOE for his student
loans.  It  also  reflects  he  has  $202  remaining  in  expendable  income  at  the  end  of  the
month. (AE F, G, H)
Applicant  disclosed  in his January 2020 SCA  that  he  traveled  to  the  Dominican
Republic in August 2018 for six to ten days for tourism. Applicant’s disclosures in his SCA,
admissions in his answer to the SOR and FORM response, along with credit reports from
March 2020 and February 2021 corroborate the SOR allegations. (Items 2, 3, 5, 6; AE G)
