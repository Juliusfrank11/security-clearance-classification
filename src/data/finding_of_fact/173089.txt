In  his answer to  the  SOR, Applicant admitted  each  allegation  (SOR ¶¶  1.a  through
1.g)  each  with  brief  comments. His admissions are incorporated  into  the  findings of  fact.
After a  thorough  and  careful review  of  the  pleadings and  exhibits  submitted, I  make  the
following findings of  fact.
Applicant is 36 years old. He graduated from high school in 2003 and from college
in  2007.  He  earned  a  Ph.D.  in  2014.  He  then  spent  two  years  as  a  post-doctoral
researcher.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  defense  contractor,  since  May
2016. He previously worked for the same company in 2007 and 2008. He and his wife
have been married since 2015; they have no children. (Item 2)
On his SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had delinquent student loans, both federal
and private. (Item 2 at 34-37). Applicant discussed these and other debts in his January
2019 background interview. (Item 3) In December 2020, he responded to interrogatories
from DOHA about his finances. He provided a personal financial statement, an October
2020  paystub,  and  a  May  2020  agreement  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education  to
rehabilitate  his  delinquent  federal  student  loans  (with  a  balance  of  about  $43,000)  by
paying $1,025 per month. (Item 4)
The SOR debts are established by Applicant’s admissions and by the credit reports
in the record, from September 2017, July 2019, April 2020, February 2021, and November
2021. (Items 5-9) The SOR debts total $36,477 in federal student loans, $14,470 in debts
to a bank, and a $936 tax lien. They are detailed as follows:
SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($16,927), 1.b ($10,589), 1.d ($5,922), and 1.f ($3,039) are all federal
student loans to the U.S. Department of Education. With his answer to the SOR, Applicant
provided a copy of the same rehabilitation agreement he submitted with his Interrogatory
Response.  According  to  that  agreement,  signed  in  May  2020,  Applicant  had  four
delinquent federal student loans, on which he owed about $43,000. He was to pay $1,025
per month. (AE A; Item 4 at 10)
Applicant explained some of his debts in his January 2019 background interview.
For some of his federal loans (originating between 2000 and 2007), he explained that he
requested forbearance in 2008 but did not clarify to the lenders that he was in graduate
school.  As  a  result,  he  began  receiving  payment  notices.  For  a  time,  he  was  on  a
repayment plan, but stopped making payments after he consulted legal counsel. Instead,
he fell behind. (Item 3)
Applicant’s federal student loans are likely in forbearance under the Coronavirus
Air,  Relief,  and  Economic  Security  (CARES)  Act  of  2020.  President  Biden  recently
extended this forbearance period through August 2022. It allows for a suspension of loan
payments, a zero percent interest rate, and collections on student loans are halted. (See
https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19). He provided no documentation
of  any  payments  made  on  his federal  student  loans,  either  before  he  entered  into  the
rehabilitation plan, or since, and he does not set forth a plan to address his federal student
loans when the CARES Act forbearance period ends.
SOR ¶¶ 1.c ($8,736) and 1.e ($5,734) are debts to a bank. Applicant indicated in
his background interview that he believes the accounts are private student loans that he
may have co-signed for his wife, but he was unsure of any details. (Item 3 at 5) His credit
reports list the accounts as being deferred, in collection, and most recently, charged off.
(Items 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) In his Answer, Applicant admitted the debts and suggested, without
corroborating evidence, that they were under the same rehabilitation agreement as the
federal student loans. These debts are unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.g ($956) is an unresolved state tax lien entered against Applicant in 2009.
(Item 5 at 2) It is not listed on subsequent credit reports. The tax lien was issued by State
1, where Applicant earned his Ph.D., between 2007 and 2014. (He now lives and works
in another state, State 2). In his background interview, he indicates that he erroneously
claimed State 1 as his residence one year and was therefore assessed tax on his income.
(Item 3 at 4) In his answer, he said that, while he admitted the debt, it is “in adjudication”
and  that  his  “income”  was  actually  an  educational  stipend.  (Item  1)  He  provides  no
documentation  to  support  either  the  fact  of  the  dispute  or  the  validity  of  his  assertion.
However, the tax lien appears to be an isolated circumstance.
With  his interrogatory  response,  Applicant  provided  an  October 2020  pay  stub  from
his employer. At that time, he  earned  $56.39  per hour and  worked  full  time.  With  a  40-
hour  work   week,  he   would  earn  $2,255.60   per  week,  and   $117,291.20   per  year  (52
weeks). (Item  5) It is presumed  that he  earns  a  similar income  now,  a  year and  a  half
later,  working   for  the   same   employer,  his  clearance   sponsor,  though   this  is  not
documented.
With his answer, Applicant provided no documentation about any efforts to pay or
resolve any of his debts, either through the debt relief program or otherwise. He provided
no updated information about his current financial stability. He also did not respond to the
FORM, so the only information about his financial situation is taken from prior information.
