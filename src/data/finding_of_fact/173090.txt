Applicant  is a  50-year-old employee  of a  defense  contractor. He  served  on  active
duty   in  the   U.S.   Navy   from   1989   until  he   retired   with   an   honorable   discharge   in  2011,
during  which  he  had  nine  years of  sea  service  and  almost four years of  foreign  service.
He is attending  college  with  a  view  toward  a bachelor’s degree. He married  in 2008  and
divorced  in  2013.  He  has a  32-year-old child. He  is living  with  his girlfriend.  (Tr.  at  18-
22; Applicant’s response to  SOR; GE  1, 2; AE  P-S)
Applicant  had  several  periods  of  unemployment  and  underemployment  from
2014, when his then employer lost a contract,  until he obtained his current job in June
2019.  He  also  had  severe  medical  problems  that  left  him  hospitalized  and  unable  to
work for extended periods. He was treated for prostate cancer in 2017. He had  blood-
clot problems with his legs, resulting in six operations over a two-year period from about
2018  to  2020.  Both  legs  were  eventually  amputated,  one  above  the  knee  and  one
below. One of his legs became infected, and he had an extended hospital stay to treat
it.  He  continues  to  have  problems,  with  another  surgery  in  October  2021.  He  has  a
100%  disability  rating  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA),  and  he
receives $3,448 per month in disability pay. The VA determined that the effective date
of  when  he  became  totally  and  permanently  disabled  due  to  his  service-connected
disabilities was in June 2020 (Tr. at 16-17, 20-27; Applicant’s response  to SOR; GE  1,
2; AE R, S)
Applicant  was  not  able  to  meet  all  of  his  financial  obligations.  Debts  became
delinquent; he lost his home to foreclosure; a car was repossessed; and he did not file
all of his federal and state income tax returns when they were due. The SOR alleges the
unfiled returns and 17 delinquent debts. However, the $4,956 delinquent debts alleged
in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.k(1)  are  duplicate  accounts.  Except  as  specifically  addressed
below,  the  debts  are  established  through  credit  reports  and  Applicant’s  admissions.
(Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-4; AE B)
Applicant did not file his federal and state income tax returns when they were due
for tax years 2016 and 2018.  He stated that he was having money issues, and he did
not file the returns if he thought he would owe money.  He filed his returns for 2017 on
time.  An  IRS  account  transcript  for  tax  year  2016,  obtained  on  January  25,  2022,
indicated  that  no  return  had  been  filed.  He  stated:  “I  did  my  2016  taxes  online  and
thought it was done, I did not know I had to mail my taxes in. That was the confusion.”
He submitted undated federal and state income tax returns for 2016, that indicated he
owed  the  IRS  $399  and  his  state  $1,215.  Those  figures  do  not  include  additional
interest  and  penalties.  He  did  not  submit  any  proof  that  he  paid  the  taxes.  (Tr.  at  38;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE C, E, L, M)
Applicant filed his federal and state income tax returns for 2017, 2019, and 2020
on  time.  An  IRS  account  transcript  for  2017,  which  was  obtained  in  January  2022,
indicated that he owed $3,647 for tax year 2017, which includes penalties and interest.
In March 2020, the IRS withheld his $342 refund for tax year 2019 and applied it to his
2017 tax debt. (Tr. at 39; AE D)
The IRS received Applicant’s 2018 federal income tax return on March 7, 2020. A
January 2022 IRS account transcript  for tax year 2018 indicated that he owed $1,671,
which includes penalties and interest. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE E)
In  January  2022,  Applicant  entered  into  a  payment  agreement  with  his  state  to
pay $8,163 in back taxes. He agreed to pay $248 per month for 36 months, with the first
payment due by February 15, 2022. He plans to set up a payment agreement with the
IRS. (Tr. at 39-40; AE I)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges $7,677 owed on a charged-off account to a credit union. The
creditor  charged  off  $9,677  in  2016,  which  is  the  balance  reflected  on  an  April  2020
credit  report.  Applicant  instituted  a  $200  per  month  payment  plan  in  2016.  He  made
consistent payments, and the balance was reduced to $7,677 in January 2021; $5,877
in October 2021; and $4,877 in March 2022. (Tr. at 17, 28-29; Applicant’s response  to
SOR; GE 3, 4; AE B, G, T, U)
SOR  ¶¶  1.j  and  1.k(2)  allege  $5,538  and  $2,812  debts  owed  to  the  same
financial institution. The April 2020 credit report lists the debts as reported by all three
credit  reporting  agencies  with  dates  of  last  activity  of  August  2014  and  October  2014.
The debts are not listed on the January 2021 Equifax credit report. Applicant  asserted
that  the  debts  were  paid,  and  provided  a  payment  chart  showing  $3,735  in  payments
between June 2017 and August 2017 on one account, and $1,157 in payments in May
2018  on  another  account.  These  accounts  are  resolved.  (Tr.  at  35-36;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE N, O)
Applicant  paid  $1,963  in  January  2021  to  resolve  the  debt  owed  to  an  online
university (SOR ¶ 1.p). He paid $162 in January 2022 to pay in full a medical debt (SOR
¶ 1.n). (Tr. at 37-38; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE F, J)
Applicant owed about $292,000 on his mortgage loan when he lost his home to
foreclosure  in  about  2017  (SOR  ¶  1.g).  The  creditor  sold  the  property  and  received  a
claim  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA),  but  there  remained  a
deficiency balance of about $72,000. The creditor wrote off the deficiency balance and
held  Applicant  and  the  VA  harmless  for  the  deficiency  balance.  (Tr.  at  19-20,  33;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE A)
Applicant asserted that he paid the medical debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e ($716)
and  1.f  ($110),  the  charged-off  $533  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.h,  and  the  $152  debt
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.o. The $152 debt is  reported by all three credit reporting agencies
on the April 2020 combined credit report, with an activity date of November 2017. It is
not listed on the January 2021 Equifax credit report. The other three debts are listed on
that  report,  which  was  obtained  about  five  months  before  the  SOR  was  issued.  The
$716 medical debt is listed on the January 2022 credit report. None of the debts appear
on  the  July  2021  TransUnion  credit  report  submitted  by  Applicant.  His  assertions  that
these  debts  were  paid  are  given  greater  weight  because  his  other  assertions  that  he
paid debts were corroborated by documentation.  (Tr. at 33-37; Applicant’s response  to
SOR; GE 2-4; AE B, K)
The remaining debts are $10,772 owed on a loan for a repossessed vehicle and
about  $10,320  owed  on  five  miscellaneous  debts.  (Tr.  at  31,  34-36;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE B)
Applicant paid several debts before the SOR was issued. He is eligible to receive
Social Security disability payments, but he wants to continue to work and be productive.
His finances are not perfect, but he credibly testified that he intends to continue to pay
his debts and his taxes. (Tr. at 25, 31, 34-36, 43-47; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE
3, 4; AE B)
