Applicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since about June 2020. He has a 10% service-connected disability
rating for his honorable service in the U.S. military from April 2014 to December 2014.
He served in the National Guard until he was discharged with a general discharge under
honorable  conditions  in  2018.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree.  He  has  never married and
he has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 16, 20-21; GE 1, 2; AE 2)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  criminal  offenses,  primarily  alcohol  related.  He  was
arrested in 2015 and charged  with assault. Alcohol was not a factor in this charge. He
explained  that  he  had  an  argument  with  his  roommate  and  pushed  him.  His  attorney
was  apparently  able  to  negotiate  a  plea  bargain  to  a  less  serious  offense.  Applicant
claims it was littering. (Tr. at 23-26; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 4)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  September  2016  and  charged  with  driving  while
intoxicated  (DWI).  The  police  report  of  the  incident  shows  that  Applicant  took  a
breathalyzer  test  that  registered  .19%  blood  alcohol  concentration  (BAC),  more  than
double  the  legal  limit.  He  pleaded  guilty  in  December  2016  and  was  sentenced  to
probation for two years. (Tr. at 33-36; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 5)
Applicant broke both of his wrists in a motorcycle accident in about 2017 after he
had been drinking. He was  able to  walk away from  the accident and  was  taken to the
hospital by a passing truck driver. There was no police involvement, and he was never
charged. (Tr. at 17-18, 22-23, 36-39; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant was drunk in February 2020 and had an argument with a friend at the
friend’s  house.  The  friend  told  Applicant  to  leave.  After  leaving,  Applicant  “keyed”  the
friend’s car and the friend’s girlfriend’s car. Applicant testified that he had about three to
four beers over a period of a couple hours and that he felt “buzzed,” but not intoxicated.
He did not feel that alcohol was a factor in his conduct because he “was super mad, and
[he]  would  have  done  it  even  if  [he]  was  sober.”  His  testimony  is  inconsistent  with  his
statement to a background investigator in August 2020 that he was super drunk during
the incident. (Tr. at 38-42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3)
An arrest warrant was issued, and Applicant was charged with two felony counts
of  property  damage.  Pursuant  to  a  plea  bargain,  in  about  February  2022,  he  pleaded
guilty  to  two  misdemeanor  counts  of  property  damage.  He  was  required  to  make
restitution of $1,625 and $1,490 to the two victims, and he was sentenced to probation
for one year. Terms of the probation included no contact with the victims and payment
of court costs. (Tr. at 15, 38-41; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 6, 7; AE 1)
Applicant testified that he has not had any alcohol since the incident in February
2020.  He  admitted  that  he  told  a  background  investigator  in  August  2020  that  he
continued to regularly drink until shortly before the interview. He testified that he lied to
the  investigator when he  told  the  investigator that he  had been  drinking when  actually
he  had  not.  He  did  not  like  his  team  at  work,  and  he  thought  if  he  did  not  receive  a
clearance he would be transferred to another team. (Tr.at 43-46; GE 2)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
June  2020.  He failed  to  report any  of  his criminal arrests  or  charges  under any  of  the
pertinent questions. (Tr. at 29-30; GE 1)
Applicant was interviewed for his background investigation in August 2020. When
asked if he had been arrested within the last seven years, if he had ever been charged
with a felony, and if he had ever been charged with a drug or alcohol-related offense, he
answered  “no”  to  each  question.  He  discussed  his  2016  DWI  after  being  specifically
confronted with it. He stated that he did not report the DWI on the SF 86 and discuss it
with the investigator because he did not know if it would show up on a records check.
Applicant  then  also  discussed  his  2015  and  2020  offenses.  He  stated  that  he  did  not
report  the  2020  arrest  and  charges  on  the  SF  86  because  he  thought  if  his  current
employer knew about the charges, he would not have been hired. (Tr. at 30-32; GE 1,
2)
Applicant  denied   intentionally   providing   false   information   on   the   SF  86.  In   his
response   to   the   SOR,   he   wrote   that  he   “did   not  fully   understand   what  charge   meant,”
and  that  he  thought that since  he  had  a  lawyer and  the  charges were reduced, he  was
not being  charged  at the  time. When  asked  at hearing  why  he  did not report  that he  had
been  arrested, he  testified: “I believe  negligence  of the  law. I thought - - I felt like  I  was
just  being  like  in  a  hold, and  I hadn’t gotten  arrested  yet,  like  until my  case  got  to  trial.”
He testified  that he  thought the  2016  DWI  charge  had  been  reduced  to  littering.  Other
than  Applicant’s  testimony, there  is no  evidence  that the  DWI  charge  had  been  reduced
to   littering.  Applicant  could  not  explain   why   he   did   not  report  a   conviction   for  littering.
