In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d,
and  1.e.  He  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.c.  His  admissions  are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  43-year-old  cyber  security  intelligence  engineer  employed  by  a
federal contractor since October 2019. He has also worked full time as an analyst for a
software company since April 2018 and part time as a rural mail carrier since September
2018. He earned a bachelor’s degree in December 2011 and a master’s degree in May
2015.
Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 2008 to 2016, received an
honorable discharge, and has served in the U.S. Army Reserve from 2016 to the present.
He  received  a  secret  clearance  in  2008,  and  has  held  eligibility  for  sensitive
compartmented information (SCI) from 2012 to the present.
Applicant married in May 2002 and separated in February 2018 after an incident
in which he admittedly punched his wife in the face after she tried to stab him with a pen,
scratched his throat, and tried to strangle him. (FORM Item 7 at 6.) The domestic relations
court  granted  him  first-offender  status,  he  completed  a  domestic  violence  training
program in February 2020, and the charges against him were dismissed in March 2020.
(FORM Item 3 at 69; AX B.) He has four minor children, ages 17, 16, 14, and 10. His wife
has primary custody and he pays child support. They divorced on a date not reflected in
the record. Applicant was the plaintiff in the divorce proceedings.
Applicant reported the domestic violence incident to his security manager and was
terminated because of it in March 2018. (FORM Item 3 at 26; FORM Item 7 at 3.) In April
2018,  he  was  hired  by  the  software  company  that  is  one  of  his  two  current  full-time
employers.  He  also  worked  as  a  self-employed  ride-share  driver  from  January to  May
2019.
The SOR alleges five delinquent debts, which are reflected in credit reports from
December  2021,  April  2021,  and  April  2020.  The  evidence  concerning  these  debts  is
summarized below.
SOR ¶  1.a: bank debt charged off  for $27,497.  This debt was incurred jointly by
Applicant  and  his  wife  to  buy  a  recreational  vehicle.  The  account  was  opened  in
November 2015. The last payment was in May 2019. (FORM Item 4 at 4.) In Applicant’s
answer to the SOR, he stated that the vehicle was surrendered to the bank because his
wife would not agree to sell it. The divorce decree provides that each party is responsible
for 50% of this debt. (AX E.) In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he stated that he had
contacted the bank about a settlement. The debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b: child-support arrearage of $22,018. Based on Applicant’s response
to the SOR and the evidence in the December 2021 credit report, Department Counsel
conceded that the security concerns raised by this debt have been mitigated.
SOR ¶  1.c:  car loan charged off for $8,428.  In Applicant’s answer to the SOR,
he stated that the car was surrendered to the bank because his ex-wife would not agree
to sell it. The divorce decree provides that each party is responsible for 50% of this debt.
In  Applicant’s  response  to  the  FORM,  he  stated  that  he  had  agreed  to  start  making
payments on  his portion  of  the  debt  in  January 2022.  He  submitted  some  handwritten
notes pertaining to his promise and reflecting an agreed amount to settle the debut, but
no documentary evidence of a payment agreement or any payments. (AX F.)
SOR ¶  1.d:  credit-card account  charged off  for $1,776.  In Applicant’s answer
to the SOR, he stated that he was making monthly payments on this debt. In his response
to  the  FORM,  he  submitted  evidence  of  monthly  payments  of  $66  from  January  to
December 10, 2021, shortly before he answered the SOR. (AX C.)
SOR  ¶  1.e:  home mortgage  loan past due  for $58,377, with an outstanding
balance  of  $723,607. Applicant’s ex-wife lived in the marital home for about a year but
did not make any payments on the mortgage loan. Applicant lived in a recreational vehicle
campground  during  this  time.  (FORM  Item  3  at  12.)  The  divorce  decree  required
Applicant’s ex-wife to sign a quitclaim deed for her interest in the home, but she has not
complied with this requirement. (AX L.) Applicant began making monthly loan payments
of $3,800 when he reoccupied the home, which are being applied to the past-due balance.
(Response to FORM; AX N; FORM Item 7 at 8.) He is seeking a modification of the loan.
(AX M.).
Applicant  did  not  provide  any  information  about  his  income  and  expenses.
However, his most recent credit report, dated December 7, 2021, reflects 39 accounts,
all of which are current or paid off, except for the accounts alleged in the SOR.
