Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owes $31,428 for six past-due
or delinquent debts (SOR 1.a – 1.f). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the
Guideline F allegations. (FORM, Items 1 and 3) In addition  to the facts established  by
Applicant’s admissions, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 31 years old and is sponsored for a security clearance by his employer,
a federal contractor. In his most recent e-QIP, he disclosed that he owed $35,171 for six
delinquent  or  past-due  debts.  A  credit  report  obtained  by  government  investigators  in
March  2021  documented  those  and  other  delinquencies  about  which  Applicant  was
interviewed by a government investigator on June 3, 2021. During the interview, Applicant
attributed his financial problems to his employer’s decision to stop allowing overtime, on
which Applicant relied to make an extra $5 hourly. When he was able to earn that extra
income, he could make at least the minimum payments on the commercial credit accounts
listed in the SOR. He did not otherwise explain why or how he incurred numerous credit
accounts  with  high  balances.  Based  on  my  review of  all  of  the  available  information,  I
conclude that Applicant was living beyond his means when his access to overtime pay
ended. (FORM, Items 4 – 6)
In  response  to  the  SOR, Applicant asserted  that he  had  resolved  one  account and
was paying  off  another  debt  that was not  one  of  those  alleged  in  the  SOR. (FORM, Item
3) He has not provided  any  information  in response  to  the  SOR or the  FORM  that would
support   that  claim.  Applicant  also  did  not  provide   any   information   about  his  current
finances  or  about  any   efforts  to   resolve   the   debts  documented   by   the   Government’s
information.
