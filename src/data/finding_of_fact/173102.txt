After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  45  years old,  divorced  and  remarried.  He  has  three  children  by  his
former  wife,  ages  20,  17,  and  14,  who  live  with  his  former  wife.  Applicant  has  three
stepchildren, ages 18, 16, and 15, who live with him and his current wife. He was awarded
an associate’s degree in December 2005. Applicant served on active duty in the Air Force
from April 2000 until he retired in May 2020 with an honorable discharge.
The  SOR  alleged  eight  delinquent  debts  that  total  $20,963  and  one  foreclosed
mortgage in 2014. Applicant admitted the allegations. More specifically, he answered that
two debts will be paid (SOR ¶¶ 1.b. and 1.c.) and one debt (SOR ¶ 1.d.) has been paid.
Applicant attributes the other debts to his separation and divorce from his first wife (SOR
¶¶  1.a.  and  1.e.  –  1.i.).  He  did  not  produce  any  documents  supporting  his  responses.
(Answer.)  Applicant did aver that the foreclosure (SOR ¶1.i.) had no balance due to the
mortgagee. The Government’s evidence supports that assertion. (Item 8.)
