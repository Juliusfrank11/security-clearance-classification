In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.i,
and  1.j.  (HE  3)  She  denied  the  other  SOR  allegations.  She  also  provided  mitigating
information. (Id.) Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 39-year-old multi-operations security specialist who has worked for
a defense contractor since May 2014. (Tr. 6, 19; GE 1) In 2001, she graduated from high
school. (Tr. 7) She received two associate’s degrees in 2006 and 2010. (GE 9 at 2-3) In
2012, she received a bachelor’s degree  with  a  major in social welfare. (Tr. 7) She  has
never married, and she does not have any children. (Tr. 7) She served on active duty in
the Navy from 2001 to 2005, and in the Active Reserve until 2010 or 2011. (Tr. 8) She
received  a  general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions  because  she  was  unable  to

Financial Considerations
In  2008, Applicant was working  for a  large  defense  contractor in security, and  in
2009, she  was going  to  begin working  in a  position  that  required  a  security  clearance,  and
she  did not receive  an  overtime-security  position  because  of  financial  issues. (Tr. 21) Her
financial  problem   in   2009   was  due   to   the   purchase   of  a   new   car,  student   loans,
unemployment,   underemployment   and   “irresponsible   spending.”  (Tr.  22)  In   2017,
Applicant was arrested  for driving  under the  influence  of alcohol (DUI). (Tr. 40; GE  2  at
5) In  2018, she  pleaded  guilty  to  reckless driving, and  the  DUI was dismissed. (Tr. 40; GE
2   at  5) The   cost  for  her  attorney,  fees,  fines,  and   costs   related   to   the   reckless   driving
offense   totaled   about $8,000  to  $10,000.  (Tr. 40) Her monthly   vehicle   insurance   costs
$150. (Tr. 40) Her annual pay  has  been  about $82,000  for  the  past  three  years.  (Tr.  19-
20)
The SOR ¶ 1.i alleges Applicant’s security clearance was revoked in 2017 because
of her finances. Her delinquent debts in 2015 to 2016 resulted when her sister and her
niece moved in with Applicant, and then her sister lost her job. (Tr. 23-24) She was also
moved to a different position at work, and her income was reduced. (GE 9 at 3) On May
15, 2015, she submitted an SCA, and on November 28, 2016, the DOD CAF issued an
SOR  alleging  security  concerns  under  Guideline  F.  On  October  26,  2017,  an
administrative judge issued a decision denying Applicant’s security clearance. See ISCR
Case No. 16-01155 (A.J. Oct. 26, 2017). The administrative judge said:
Applicant admitted  each  of  the  12  SOR allegations, including: a  mortgage-
loan   account  that  was  $3,995   past  due   with   a   total  balance   of   $176,697
(SOR ¶  1.a),  a  $8,751  charged-off  auto-loan  account that  was placed  for
collection   by   a   creditor  who   was  later  granted   a   $12,373   court  judgment
(SOR ¶¶  1.b  and  1.k),  five  credit-card  accounts in  charge-off  or collection
status  totaling   $10,765   (SOR  ¶¶   1.c,   1.e,  1.f.,   1.g.,   and   1.i),  a   $10,653
federal student-loan  account  (SOR ¶  1.d) and  two  medical accounts  totaling
$946  (SOR ¶¶  1.h  and  1.j) in collection  status.  The  debts alleged  in  SOR ¶¶
1.h  through  1.j have been resolved.
Wage garnishments were issued against Applicant to collect the auto-loan
and  the  student-loan  debts,  in  December  2014  and  November  2015,
respectively. In her SOR answer, Applicant averred, without providing any
corroborating documentary evidence, that the garnishment for the auto-loan
debt  would  be  satisfied  in  February  2017,  and  the  student-loan  debt  in
March  2017.  One  of  Applicant’s  federal  tax  refunds  was  intercepted  to
collect the student-loan debt. Another wage garnishment was issued  and
satisfied in September 2014 to collect a $463 delinquent debt owed for an
unspecified delinquent account (SOR ¶ 1.l).
In her SOR answer, Applicant claimed, without providing any corroborating
documentary  evidence, that she  was “on  track  with  a  repayment plan”  to  get
caught up  with  her mortgage-loan  payments,  that she  was adhering  to  the
terms of   the   payment  plans  she   arranged   to   resolve   the  debts  alleged   in
SOR ¶¶ 1.e.  and  1.g  (the  latter  of  which she expected  would be  completed
in approximately March 2017). She intended  to  negotiate payment plans to
resolve  the  debts alleged  in SOR ¶¶  1.c and  1.f, and  to  pay  the  debt alleged
in SOR ¶  1.i in December 2016.
Id. at 2-3 (footnotes omitted).
Applicant’s SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling $39,561 as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant’s $162,193 mortgage was past due in the amount of
$9,032. In 2012, she purchased her residence. (Tr. 25) Her foundation settled, and she
needed about $35,000 for repairs. (Tr. 27)  In her August 10, 2020 Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) interview, she said she was behind about $3,000 on her mortgage,
and  she  was  working on  a loan modification.  (GE  2 at 7)  Her  October 29, 2021  credit
report  indicates  her  date  of  last  activity  was  July  2019,  and  the  past-due  amount  is
$29,137. (GE 6 at 5) She said she stopped making payments for about one year. (Tr. 38)
She made one payment in a mortgage rehabilitation process in which she has to make
two more payments, and then, the past-due amount is scheduled to be rolled into a new
mortgage at a low interest rate. (Tr. 25-26) Her mortgage payment will be $1,245, which
is the same amount as before the mortgage rehabilitation. (Tr. 27) She said she could
provide the documentation explaining the mortgage rehabilitation. (Tr. 28) She believes
the fair market value of her home is about $354,000, and she intends to sell it  early in
2022 without correcting the foundation problem. (Tr. 38)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant has a charged-off vehicle loan for $12,509. Applicant
said she was making $250 monthly payments to address the debt. (Tr. 29) She did not
provide documentation showing her monthly payments or the current status of the debt.
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a medical debt placed for collection for $1,044 and ¶ 1.d alleges
a  charged-off  bank  debt for $982.  Applicant said  both debts were  paid, and  she  could
provide documentation showing payment. (Tr. 30-31) However, she did not provide post-
hearing documentation showing payment.
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a charged-off store debt for $534. Applicant said the debt was
paid in 2016 or 2017. (Tr. 31) Applicant’s July 21, 2020 credit report shows a last activity
date of February 2016, and a status of settled for less than full balance. (GE 5 at 7) This
debt is resolved. (Tr. 43)
SOR ¶  1.f alleges an  account  placed  for collection  for $7,868.  Applicant said this
signature loan  was paid  through  a  garnishment in  2015.  (Tr.  32)  Applicant’s October 29,
2021  credit report sh  ows a  date  of last  activity  of March  2015  and  a  zero balance. (GE 6
at 5) This debt is resolved.  (Tr. 43)
SOR  ¶¶  1.g  and  1.h  allege  two  federal  student  loans  placed  for  collection  for
$2,495 and $5,097. Applicant said her student loans were paid through a garnishment.
(Tr.  32)  Applicant’s  October  29,  2021  credit  report  only  includes  one  student  loan  for
$6,068.  (GE  6  at  4)  The  past  due  amount  is  $0,  and  the  status  is  “pays  account  as
agreed.” (Id.) She stopped making payments on her student loan due to the COVID-19
forbearance.  (Tr.  33)  In  March  2020,  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the
Department of Education placed federal student loans in forbearance. On December 22,
2021, the Department of Education extended the student loan payment pause through
May  1,  2022.  The  pause  includes  the  following  relief  measures  for  eligible  loans:  a
suspension of loan payments; a 0% interest rate; and stopped collections on defaulted
loans.  See  Federal  Student  Aid  website,  https://studentaid.gov/announcements-
events/covid-19. These debts are resolved or being resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.j  alleges  Applicant  was  denied  a  sensitive  federal position  because  of
financial issues in 2009. Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 1.j.
Applicant received a 30-minute financial-counseling session through her employer.
(Tr. 24-25) She has about $14,000 in a 401(k) retirement account. (Tr. 34) In April 2021,
she borrowed $5,000 from her 401(k) account to assist her sister and nephew. (Tr. 34)
She has had four involuntary garnishments from her pay. One was for the signature loan
in SOR ¶ 1.f; two were for student loans; and one was for a vehicle loan. (Tr. 37) All of
the garnishments were completed, and those four debts are resolved.
