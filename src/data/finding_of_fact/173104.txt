Applicant  is  a  28-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  where  he  has
worked  since  February  2022.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  military  from  2013
until he  was  discharged  with  a  general  under honorable  conditions discharge  in  2015.
He  is  attending  college.  He  married  in  2012  and  has  been  separated  since  2015.  He
has no children. (Tr. at 10, 19-21, 24, 46-48, 50; GE 1)
Applicant has a history of financial problems going back to his time in the military.
He reported on his May 2021 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that
he  “[h]ad financial issues and asked to be chaptered out in  order  to fix them.” Conduct
issues also factored in the discharge. (Tr. at 14-15, 24-25; GE 1-3)
The SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling about $23,800. The debts include
a loan for the purchase of a dog (SOR ¶ 1.a - $5,292), a loan for college (SOR ¶ 1.b -
$2,328),  a  delinquent  phone  bill  (SOR  ¶  1.c  - $2,287),  a  credit  account  for  home
furnishings (SOR ¶ 1.e - $3,213), and the deficiency balances owed on two auto loans
after the vehicles were  repossessed and  sold (SOR ¶¶ 1.d - $7,182 and 1.f  - $3,499).
(Tr. at 36-44; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3) Applicant admitted owing all of the
debts in the SOR, with the comment:
I  admit  that  I  made  very  poor  financial  and  budgeting  errors  when  I  was
younger  which  resulted  in  several accounts becoming delinquent. I  know
now that I am older that it was wrong and irresponsible. Over the past few
years  I  have  paid  off  several  accounts  to  work  on  fixing  my  credit.  I  will
seek financial advice from professionals and do what I need to do to pay
off these final few remaining accounts as soon as possible. I can provide
my  credit  report  to  show  that  I  have  been  actively  working  on  resolving
accounts as well as my current budget and financial plan to finish paying
off all remaining debts. (Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant had a vehicle repossessed in about 2014. The $7,182 charged-off debt
alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.d  represents  the  deficiency  balance  owed  on  the  loan  after  the
vehicle was sold. (Tr. at 42-43; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3)
Applicant bought and financed a luxury vehicle (M1) in about 2017. While he still
owned and was paying  for that vehicle, he bought  a truck in November 2018  that was
financed  with  an  auto  loan  of  about  $27,689.  He  explained  that  where  he  lived,  most
people owned trucks. He kept M1 for his sister to use to go to work and school. In about
December 2019, he traded in the truck for the purchase of another luxury vehicle  (M2)
that was two years old. He owed about $21,000 on the loan for the truck, but the dealer
gave  him  $28,000  for  the  truck.  The  remainder  of  the  purchase  price  of  M2  was
financed  with  a  loan  of  about  $32,700.  M1  was  voluntarily  repossessed  in  about
October 2020. To clarify a somewhat confusing situation, Applicant owned and had auto
loans for a  luxury vehicle  (M1) and  a  truck  at  the  same  time,  and  he  then  owned  and
had  loans  for  two  luxury  vehicles  (M1  and  M2)  at  the  same  time.  One  of  the  luxury
vehicles (M1) was voluntarily repossessed. The $3,499 charged-off debt alleged in SOR
¶ 1.f represents  the  deficiency  balance  owed  on  the  loan  after M1  was sold. (Tr. at 29-
32, 54-55
Applicant stated that he lost track of the SOR debts because they did not appear
on  the  credit  reports  he  obtained.  He  was  reminded  of  the  debts  through  the  security
clearance process. In March 2022, he made arrangements to pay $40 per month toward
the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b to 1.f. The holder of the SOR ¶ 1.a debt informed him
that  the  debt  was  transferred  to  a  collection  company.  He  was  unable  to  contact  the
collection  company,  and  the  Better  Business  Bureau  reported  the  company  as  out  of
business. He stated that he did not start paying the SOR debts sooner because  of the
expenses of relocating to a new area for his current job. He documented $40 payments
in  March  2022  toward  the debts  alleged  in SOR  ¶¶  1.b, 1.d,  and 1.e.  He documented
$40 payments in April 2022 toward the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b to 1.f. (Tr. at 16-17,
32-34, 38-45; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE A-H, K, M, N, R-W)
Applicant paid delinquent debts that were not alleged in the SOR. The June 2021
and  March  2022  credit  reports  indicate  that  he  paid  or  settled  debts  of  $877,  $1,375,
$169, and $1,409. He also paid several debts that may not have been delinquent when
they were paid.  He  estimated  that  he  paid debts totaling  “10,000  to  $15,000,  at least.”
He  has  a  $41,246  student  loan  that  is  in  deferment.  He  received  financial  counseling,
and he has a budget. He stated that he wants to put his mistakes behind him and make
better financial decisions. He asserted that he has the ability to pay his creditors, and he
plans to continue to do so. (Tr. at 15, 18-19, 22, 25-29, 33-36, 45; GE 2, 3; AE I, J, L, P,
X-Z)
Applicant  called  a  witness  who  testified  that  since  he  started  working  for  their
company  in  February  2022, he  has been  “an  exemplary  employee, he’s hard  working,
he’s on time.” (Tr. at 49-50)
