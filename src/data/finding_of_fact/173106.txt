Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  in  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  and  denied  the
allegations in 1.c and 1.d. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony,
and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  64  years old.  He  was  married  once from  2003  to  2006  and has no
children.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in 1990.  He  was  self-employed  from  2004  to
2015  and  was  unemployed  from  approximately December 2015  to February 2017.  He
was underemployed until he began working for his present employer in May 2020. His
current annual salary is approximately $90,000. (Transcript (Tr.) 22-27)
Applicant  attributed  his  delinquent  debts  to  his  period  of  unemployment  and
underemployment. In 2015, he lost a contract with the federal government. He attributed
it  to  a  cut  in  the  defense  budget  at  the  time.  Prior  to  then,  he  had  met  his  financial
obligations. He worked at different jobs and slowly increased his annual income. In 2019,
he  decided  to  begin  collecting  Social Security  benefits.  Applicant provided  a  copy  of  his
Social  Security   earning   statement,   which  showed   his  annual   earnings:  2014-$23,000;
2015-$20,000;  2016-$13,600;  2017-$25,000;  2018-$32,000;  2019-$47,000;  2020-
$55,000 and 2021-$88,000. (Tr.  49-55;  AE I)
Applicant inherited a house from his parents that is paid for and has no mortgage.
His  car  is  paid.  Since  he  began  his  current  employment  he  has  saved  approximately
$6,000 and contributed a combined amount of about $11,000 in his Individual Retirement
Account  and  his  401K  pension  plan.  He  also  invested  about  $1,400  in  stocks.  Post-
hearing,  Applicant  provided  information  that  after  receiving  Social  Security  benefits  he
changed his mind and he has repaid the Social Security Administration $17,000 that he
received. He also provided an August 2009 credit report to show at that time his credit
score was 745. (Tr. 27- 32, 56-58; AE C, D, E, F, H)
The  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  are  corroborated  by  Applicant’s  admissions,
statements, and credit reports from March 2018, April 2019, February 2021, and March
2022. (GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
Applicant purchased a boat when he was employed and owned it for a couple of
years.  In  2016,  when  he  was  no  longer  employed  he  was  unable  to  make  the  loan
payments.  He  voluntarily  returned  the  boat  to  the  creditor.  (SOR  ¶  1.a-$22,876)  He
disclosed this debt on his February 2018 security clearance application (SCA) and stated
it  was  resolved.  In  December  2018,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government
investigator.  He  told  the  investigator  that  after  he  returned  the  boat  to  the  creditor  he
believed the issue was resolved. He could not explain how he believed it was resolved.
He testified that he contacted the bank that gave him the loan for the boat in 2016, 2017
and  2018.  The  bank  also  contacted  him  wanting  to  collect  the  debt  and  offered  him  a
settlement  of  $8,000.  He  could  not  afford  the  settlement  because he  did  not  have  the
money at the time. Applicant testified that he is near retirement and does not intend to
pay  this  debt.  Post-hearing,  he  stated  that  the  debt  was  charged  off  in  2016  and  the
account was closed in April 2021. It is unresolved. (Tr. 37-40, 55-56)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($15,252) was a signature loan that Applicant obtained. He
stopped  paying  the  loan  when  he  was  unemployed  and  could  not  afford  to  pay.  He
disclosed  this  debt  on  his  SCA  and  said  he  could  not  afford  to  pay  it.  He  told  the
government investigator that he reached out to the creditor in December 2017  after he
got  a  job  and  was  told  the  loan  was  in  collection,  and  he  would  be  contacted  by  the
creditor’s attorneys. He testified that he was waiting to hear from the attorney and never
did. At that time, he made no other attempts to resolve the debt. At his hearing, he testified
that he did not intend to pay the debt. After his hearing, he contacted the attorney of the
creditor and was advised it could not locate the account. The debt is unresolved. (Tr. 34-
37, 55-56)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($5,704) was for a credit card that became delinquent in
2016.  In  2018,  Applicant  reached  a  settlement  with  the  creditor  and  made  monthly
payments to resolve  the  debt.  It is listed on his credit  report as  settled. This debt  was
resolved in February 2021. (Tr. 32, 40-43, 48-49; Answer to SOR; GE 4, 6)
Applicant testified that he could not identify the medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d
($264). He attempted to contact the creditor and was told the company no longer existed.
He thought it could possibly be for a laboratory expense. He provided a letter from the
laboratory  service  noting  he  had  a  zero  balance.  He  has  made  a  reasonable  effort  to
resolve this debt. I find in his favor for this debt. (Tr. 43-47)
Applicant testified that in June 2020, he met a woman from the Philippines through
an Internet site. They text or talk a couple of times a day. They may have a video chat
once or twice a day. She told him she had lost her accounting job and was unemployed.
In February 2021, Applicant began sending her $400 a month  and continues to do so.
Applicant stated she is now employed, but it is not enough to support herself. He does
not know who her employer is, but believes it is a private company. He is unaware if she
or her family have government contacts, but believes her parents are retired and live in
the country. In March 2022, he traveled to the Philippines to visit her for two weeks. He
refers to her as his girlfriend and confirmed he has a romantic relationship with her. He
told his facility security officer (FSO) about 18 months ago that he intended to travel to
the Philippines in the future. He did not tell his FSO about the actual trip until his return.
He could not recall if he told the FSO that he was visiting his girlfriend in the Philippines.
His estimated that his trip cost about $3,000 to $3,500. He provided documents to show
he  received  a  foreign  travel  debrief  upon  his return  from  the  Philippines  in  late  March
2022. His foreign travel debriefing document asked if during his foreign travel he made
any  acquaintances  with  any  foreign  nationals.  He  answered  “no.”  He  provided  a
document  to  show  he  enrolled  in  United  States  Department  of  State  Smart  Traveler
Enrollment Program indicating he was traveling to the Philippines. (Tr. 58-81; AE G)
