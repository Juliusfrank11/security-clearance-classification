Applicant  is  a  54-year-old  former  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  where  he
worked from 2018 until he was laid off in September 2021. The company continues to
sponsor  him,  and  he  will  be  rehired  if  he  receives  a  security  clearance.  He  served  on
active duty in the U.S. military or in the military reserve from 1989 until he retired with an
honorable discharge in 2008. He has about 90 college credits. He is married with three
adult children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 16-17, 20-21; GE 1)
Applicant  served  in  war  zones  while  on  active  duty.  He  has  a  100%  disability
rating  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  for  posttraumatic  stress
disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, and a heart condition. He receives about $3,915 per
month in disability pay. He stated that he is now on medication and “doing great.” (Tr. at
19-22, 24)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  problems,  which  he  attributed  to  his  PTSD,
bipolar disorder, and periods of unemployment and underemployment after leaving the
military. (Tr. at 18, 28-29, 39; GE 1-5) The SOR alleges nine delinquent debts  totaling
about $20,900. The debts consist of $6,265 and $4,377 owed on two military exchange
charged-off credit cards; three medical debts totaling $4,839; a charged-off auto loan of
$5,043; and three miscellaneous delinquent debts ranging from $27 to $259 for a total
of $375. Applicant admitted that he owed all of the debts at one time, but he stated that
at least two of the debts were paid.
Applicant  stated  that  he  stopped  paying  the  two  military  exchange  credit  cards
(SOR  ¶¶  1.a and  1.c) in  about  2009.  That  is consistent  with  what  is  listed  on  the  July
2018  combined  credit  report.  He  entered  into  a  payment  agreement  for  the  two
accounts in April 2021. He agreed to pay $3,700 in May 2021, followed by 22 monthly
payments  of  $500.  He  made  a  $3,700  payment  in  May  2021,  and  $500  payments  in
June, July, and August 2021. He stopped making the payments when he was laid off in
September 2021. (Tr. at 22; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-6; AE A, B)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  a  $5,045  charged-off  auto  loan.  The  July  2018  combined
credit report lists it as a joint account opened in 2012. Applicant stated that he cosigned
the loan for his son who was supposed to make the payments, but failed to do so. It is
unclear when the vehicle was repossessed, but Applicant stated that he thought it was
in about 2016 or 2017. The summary of Applicant’s background interview indicates that
Applicant told the investigator that his son totaled the car in an accident. The June 2019
Equifax credit report lists the account as opened in April 2012, with a date of last action
(DLA) of January 2014. The debt is not listed on the March 2021 Equifax credit report,
likely  because  it  “aged  off”  the  report  because  it  was  past  the  seven-year  reporting
window. (Tr. at 18, 24-25; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-6)
Applicant financed  another vehicle  in about November 2015. He stopped  paying
the   loan,   with   the   last   payment  made   in   about  June   2016.1   It  is   unclear  when   it  was
voluntarily   repossessed,  but  Applicant   stated   that  he   thought  it  was  in  late   2017.   The
creditor  charged   off   $8,599   and   transferred   the   account  to   a   collection   company.  For
whatever reason,  this  account was not  listed  on  July  2018  combined  credit  report or the
June   2019   Equifax   credit  report,   but   it  is  listed   on   the   March  2021   and   April  2022
Equifax credit reports.  (Tr. at 29-30; GE 2-6)
Applicant paid the $89 telecommunications debt (SOR ¶ 1.f) on March 30, 2021.
His assertion that he paid the $27 public utility debt (SOR ¶ 1.e) is accepted. He denied
ever  having  insurance  with  the  carrier  for  the  $259  insurance  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.g).  He
stated that he contacted the carrier, and they could not locate the debt. This debt was
listed on July 2018 combined credit report, but not the three more recent reports. (Tr. at
17, 27-28; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-6; AE A, D)
Applicant  had  many  medical  bills.  He  stated  during  his  background  interview  in
March 2019 that the $1,944 medical debt (SOR ¶ 1.h) was for a medevac helicopter. He
stated  that  he  was  paying  $410  per  month  until  the  debt  was  paid  off.  Two  of  the
medical debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i) are listed on the July 2018 combined credit report.
One medical debt (SOR ¶ 1.d) was listed on the June 2019 Equifax credit report. None
of the medical debts are listed on the March 2021 or April 2022 Equifax credit reports.
(Tr. at 26; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-6)
Applicant stated that his finances are better, and that he was able to buy a home
in March 2021. Payments on the SOR debts are on hold due to the current job lay off.
He  asserted  that  he  will  return  to  paying  his  debts  after  he  is  rehired.  He  has  not
received financial counseling. (Tr. at 19, 30-32; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-6)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
June  2018.  He  failed  to  report  his  financial  problems  under  any  question,  including
questions  that  asked  if  in  the  last  seven  years,  he  had  any  possessions  or  property
voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed (this section not alleged); if he defaulted on any
type of loan (not alleged); if had bills or debts turned over to a collection company; if he
had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as
agreed; if  he  had been over 120 days delinquent on any debt;  and if he was currently
over 120 delinquent on any debt. (GE 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  March  2019.  He
discussed the debts from the July 2018 credit report. The second repossessed vehicle
was not listed on that report, and there is no indication that Applicant ever brought it to
the investigator’s attention. (GE 2)
Applicant denied intentionally providing false information on the SF 86. He stated
that  he  knew  that  he  had  two  repossessed  vehicles  and  he  owed  debts,  but  he  was
1  This debt was not alleged in the SOR. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will not be used for
disqualification  purposes.  It  may be  considered  in  assessing  Applicant’s  credibility,  in  the  application  of
mitigating conditions, and in the whole-person analysis.
unsure why he answered the way he did. He stated that the information that he provided
was to the best of his knowledge, but it could have been related to his PTSD and bipolar
disorder. (Tr. at 19, 32; Applicant’s response to SOR)
