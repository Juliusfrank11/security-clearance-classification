In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c,
1.e, 1.k, 1.o, and 1.p, and he denied the other SOR allegations. (HE 3) He also provided
mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings
follow.
Applicant is 51 years old, and he tests virtual reality software for a DOD contractor.
(Tr. 6, 48; GE 2) In 1988, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 6) In 2005, he received an
associate’s degree in computer network technology. (Tr. 6-7) He served in the Navy from
1989 to 2009, and he honorably retired as a petty officer first class (E-6). (Tr. 8) His Navy
rating was operations specialist. (Tr. 8) Applicant has a 70 percent disability rating from
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). (Tr. 8-9)
In 2001, Applicant married, and his two children are ages 22 and 30. (Tr. 7) There
is  no  evidence  that  Applicant  uses  illegal  drugs,  violated  security,  or  has  issues  with
excessive alcohol consumption. (GE 1; GE 2)
Financial Considerations
Applicant separated  from  his spouse  in late  2015  or early  2016. (Tr. 20-21) In  mid-
2017, he  moved  back into  his residence  in  an  attempt  to  reconcile  with  his spouse.  (Tr.
21) In  mid-2018,  he  moved  out again.  (Tr. 21-22) He  was unemployed  from  December
2017 to April 2018. (GE  2  at 13)  In  September 2021, he  filed  for divorce. (Tr.  14, 42)
On February 8, 2021, Applicant’s lawyer wrote:
[Applicant] is under a Pendente Lite order of the court whereby he must pay
a  temporary  order  of  support  to  his  wife.  He  has  complied  with  the
temporary order to maintain the care for his spouse while they have been
separated. I have no reason to believe the court ordered payments will not
come to an end in the next several months as [Applicant] has given his wife
ample time to become financially independent.
Unfortunately, Covid-19  caused  many  civil matters to  be  continued  to  allow
the   Court  to   clear  its  criminal  docket.   I   humbly   submit  to   you   that   if  you
allowed   him   to   maintain  his   clearance,   any   financial  or  credit   matters
resulting  from this divorce proceeding  would be  resolved  once  we  have  a
final order of  the  court relieving  him  of  his current temporary  spousal support
payment to his wife. I  have been practicing family law for over 12 years . . .
and  I have  no  reason  to  believe  that [Applicant]  will remain in this temporary
circumstance  for any  long  duration  of  time  in the  foreseeable  future.  (AE  A)
Applicant  expects  his divorce  to  be final at  the  end  of  March  2022.  (Tr. 46) His
spouse is employed outside her home. (Tr. 43) He provides $1,500 to $1,700 monthly to
his  spouse  for  support.  (Tr.  43;  AE  I)  Applicant’s  personal  financial  statement  (PFS)
indicates his monthly gross income is $8,442, and his net monthly income is $7,802. (Tr.
44,  49;  AE  F)  His  PFS  net  monthly  remainder  is  $1,613.  (Tr.  45;  AE  F)  However,  he
included his rent ($1,300) in the PFS debt section and in his PFS expense section, which
resulted in a double deduction from his net income. (AE F) He did not include his monthly
spousal support ($1,500) as an expense. (Id.) He included his spouse’s income ($2,692)
in  the  PFS  gross  monthly income.  (Id.)  He  did  not  show any payments  to  address  his
student loans on his PFS. (Id.) Consequently, his available monthly remainder is much
less than the $1,613 he indicated in his PFS.
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant failed to file his federal income tax return for tax year
(TY) 2016, and SOR ¶ 1.b alleges he owed $1,500 in federal income taxes for TY 2016.
Applicant said his marital difficulties distracted him, and he forgot to file his federal income
tax return for TY 2016. (Tr. 20) He never filed his federal income tax return for TY 2016.
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a tax return for him and transferred about $730
from his refund for TY 2017 or 2018 to pay his taxes for TY 2016. (Tr. 23-25) In 2017 or
2018, he filed his state income tax return for TY 2016. (Tr. 24) In regard to his federal and
state income tax debts,  stated,  “the taxes  were  taken out of  my check  last  year for all
unpaid taxes.” (AE B) He did not provide documentation showing his taxes were paid or
when the IRS filed his tax return for TY 2016.
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant has student loans placed for collection for $43,276.
Applicant’s October 10, 2018 credit report indicates that he has a past-due “Government
Unsecured Guarantee Loan” for $34,343. (GE 3 at 3) The last activity on this account was
in  May 2017.  (Id.) The debt  is in  collection  status.  (Id.) Student  loans for $11,947 and
$8,285 were permanently assigned to the Federal Government. (Id. at 3-4) His December
3, 2019 credit report shows his student loan is in collection, and the balance is $43,276.
(GE 4 at 2) The record does not contain any credit reports that are more recent than his
December 3, 2019 credit report.
In  early  2017,  Applicant  stopped  going  to  class,  and  he  was  supposed  to  start
making $330 monthly payments thereafter on his student loans. (Tr. 27, 50) He said in
2017, he made about four payments to address his student loans. (Tr. 50) He lacked the
funds to continue to make payments. (Tr. 28) He did not provide documents proving he
made the four payments.
In  March  2020,  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  Department  of
Education  placed  federal  student  loans  in  forbearance.  The  Department  of  Education
extended the student loan payment pause through August 2022. The pause includes the
following relief measures for eligible loans: a suspension of loan payments; a 0% interest
rate;  and  stopped  collections  on  defaulted  loans.  See  Federal  Student  Aid  website,
https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19.
Applicant said he contacted the creditor, and he planned to start making payments
in May 2022. (Tr. 26) A university-related creditor recently emailed Applicant that he had
an outstanding tuition balance of $10,794, and the creditor suggested settlement of the
debt for a lesser amount or that he establish a payment plan. (AE G)  Applicant did not
show the $10,794 balance was part of or encompassed the $43,276 student loan debt in
SOR ¶. 1.c.
SOR  ¶   1.d   alleges  Applicant  has  a   delinquent  debt  for  furniture  with   a   balance
amount of $3,403  and  a payment  due  of $187.  (GE 4 at 2) When  Applicant moved  out of
an  apartment,  he  called  the  furniture owner and  told them  to  pick-up  their  furniture. (Tr.
29) The  owner picked  up  the  furniture,  and  Applicant  said he  paid $185,  which resolved
the  debt. (Tr. 29; AE D)
SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.k allege charged-off debts for $1,879 and $2,938. Applicant said
the debts resulted from credit cards that he shared with his spouse. (Tr. 32, 34) The debts
have  been  delinquent  for  two  or  three  years.  (Tr.  32,  34)  He  expects  family  court  to
allocate these debts to him or his spouse in the divorce. (Tr. 34)
SOR ¶¶ 1.f through 1.j, 1.l, and 1.n allege seven delinquent medical debts for $160,
$95, $92, $62, $48, $1,378, and $160. Applicant was unaware of the debts because he
believed  his medical  insurance  paid  for his medical  care.  (Tr. 33) Applicant’s  pay  was
garnished on December 22, 2021, for $533 and on January 7, 2022, for  $627, and he
provided his pay statements showing the garnished payments. (Tr. 35; AE E) On March
2, 2022, a medical creditor wrote that Applicant paid $800 toward a judgment of $1,155.
(AE E) He said all of the SOR medical debts were paid in full. (Tr. 32, 34, 37; AE B)
SOR ¶ 1.m alleges a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $438. On
March 2, 2021, Applicant paid this debt, and he provided a receipt showing payment. (Tr.
36; AE B)
SOR ¶ 1.o alleges in 2017 Applicant was evicted and owes his landlord $2,700.
On March 14, 2017, April 7, 2017, and May 10, 2017, his landlord obtained three default
judgments against Applicant totaling about $3,000. (GE 5) Applicant said about two years
ago he discussed the debt with the creditor; however, he did not agree to the amount of
the  debt  or  make  any  payments.  (Tr.  39)  There  is  no  evidence  of  subsequent
communications between Applicant and this creditor.
SOR ¶ 1.p alleges in April 2004, Applicant filed for bankruptcy, and in July 2004,
his nonpriority and unsecured debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy
Code. Applicant said he and his spouse had substantial debts, and they elected to seek
resolution through bankruptcy. (Tr. 40)
