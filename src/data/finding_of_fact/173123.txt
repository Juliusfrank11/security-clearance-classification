Applicant  is  a  31-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has
worked since August 2017. He earned a bachelor’s degree in May 2017. He has never
been married and has no children. (Items 5, 9)
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  owes  15  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $56,000
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.o). Applicant’s delinquent debt is largely comprised of student loans, but
also includes a credit-card debt, a medical debt, and a car note. Applicant admitted the
12 student loans in the SOR, but denied the three remaining debts, asserting that those
debts are not delinquent. He asserted that, through his current employment, he now has
sufficient  funds  to  pay  off  his  delinquent  debts.  I  find  that  the  SOR  allegations  are
established through credit reports and Applicant’s admissions. (Items 1-9)
The car note debt that was past due in the amount of $1,174 with an outstanding
balance  of  $12,327  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  has  been  resolved.  This  debt  became
delinquent when the checks that Applicant wrote to pay the debt were not delivered to
the  creditor  because  they  were  sent  to  the  wrong  mailbox.  Applicant  committed  to
bringing  this  debt  current.  The  January  2022  credit  bureau  report  (CBR)  reported  this
debt as a  paid  charge-off. The  debt was  listed  in the September 2019  CBR but not  in
the August 2020 CBR. (Items 1, 4, 6, 8, 9)
The  $237  medical  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  has  not  been  resolved.  Applicant
averred this debt is not delinquent. He did not recognize this account. He asserted that
he would research the account to see if it is his. He averred that he would pay the debt
if  it  is  his.  This  debt  is  listed  as  delinquent  on  the  September  2019  and  August  2020
CBRs. The debt is not listed on  the January 2022 CBR. Applicant did not provide any
documentation  establishing the  debt  was  paid,  disputed,  or otherwise  resolved.  (Items
1, 4, 7, 8, 9)
The  $2,619  credit-card  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  has  been  partially  resolved.
Applicant  averred  that  this  debt  is  not  delinquent  and  that  he  has  been  making
payments  on  the  debt.  The  debt  is  listed  as  delinquent  on  the  September  2019,  the
August 2020, and the January 2022 CBRs. On the January 2022 CBR, the balance on
this debt reflects recent payments and has been reduced to $461. Applicant opened the
credit-card account to purchase a computer for school, but then placed other expenses
on  the  credit  card  for  which  he  did  not  have  the  money  to  pay  as  he  was  a  student.
(Items 1, 4, 5-9)
The student loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.o totaling $52,281 have not
been resolved. Applicant claimed that he did not know these debts were delinquent and
that  his  grandmother  was  supposed  to  be  paying  them.  He  averred  that  he  would
contact  the  creditors  and  make  payment  arrangements  to  bring  the  accounts  current.
However,  he  did  not  provide  any  documentation  establishing  the  debts  were  paid  or
otherwise resolved. The student loans are listed in the August 2020 and January 2022
CBRs, which reflect a date of first delinquency of December 2018 and do not reflect any
payments  after  December  2019.  While  neither  party  has  provided  evidence  to  this
effect,  I  have   taken   administrative   notice   that  all   federal  student  loans  have   been   in  a
deferment status as of late  March 2020 at the  earliest. (Items 1, 4, 6-9)
Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM,  so  more  recent  information  about  his
finances is not available.
