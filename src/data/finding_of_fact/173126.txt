In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.e,
1.f, and  2.b. (HE  3)  He  denied  the other SOR allegations.  He also provided mitigating
information. (Id.) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a  39-year-old employee  of a  DOD contractor who  has worked  for this
employer since October 2018. (Tr. 8; GE 1) In 2000, he graduated  from high school. (Tr.
8)  In  2019, he  received  a  bachelor’s degree.  (Tr. 8; AE  13)  He served  in the  Navy  from
2007  to  August 2016. (Tr. 9) He received  a  general discharge  under honorable  conditions.
(Tr. 9)   He  was a  petty   officer second   class   (E-5) when  he   was discharged.  (Tr. 9)   His
Navy   specialty   was  logistics.  (Tr.  9)  He  was  married   from   2008   to   2011,  and   his  two
children   are   ages  12   and   14.   (Tr.  10)   His  dating   relationship   with   his  former  spouse
continued  until 2013. (Tr. 25)
Financial Considerations
Applicant  cited  a  contentious  divorce  in  2011  as  the  genesis  of  his  financial
problems leading up to his 2014 bankruptcy. (Tr. 22) He had expensive legal bills because
his former spouse made allegations against him. (Tr. 23) He went back to family court
three or four times to clarify visitation rules. (Tr. 24) He was not deployed after 2012. (Tr.
24) He was unemployed from August to October 2016, from January to September 2017,
and  from  April  to  October  2018.  (Tr.  45;  GE  13  at  2)  On  April  16,  2019,  an  Office  of
Personnel  Management  (OPM)
investigator  confronted  Applicant  about  several
delinquent debts. (GE 13 at 6-7) His current annual salary is $48,000. (Tr. 45) However,
it is unclear whether he included his income from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
or from his girlfriend in his income. (GE 13 at 2) His monthly child-support obligation is
$1,100, and  he  has  the  child-support  payment  made  automatically  from  his paycheck.
(Tr. 46) His monthly rent is $1,250, and his car payment is $600. (Tr. 47) He said he uses
a written budget, and he said he would provide it after his hearing. (Tr. 48) However, he
did not provide his budget. (Tr. 48) His tax returns are filed, and he does not currently
owe taxes. (Tr. 49-50) He did not provide copies of his tax returns for the last three years.
The SOR includes the following financial allegations:
SOR ¶  1.a alleges Applicant’s debts were discharged in June 2014 under Chapter
7 of the Bankruptcy Code. His unsecured nonpriority claims totaled $47,949. (GE 6 at 9)
His  priority  claims  included  $3,203  in  taxes,  $22,909  in  student  loans,  and  $1,394  in
domestic support. (Id. at 10) He owed federal income taxes for the following years: 2009
($906); 2011 ($736); 2012 ($781); and 2013 ($780). (Id. at 20) In his February 28, 2019
SCA he disclosed his bankruptcy in June 2014; however, he did not disclose that he failed
to pay his federal taxes when required by law in the previous seven years. (GE 1 at 50)
At his hearing, he said he paid his federal income tax debt with refunds for subsequent
tax years. (Tr. 26) However, he did not provide proof that his federal income taxes were
paid. He received financial counseling as part of the bankruptcy process. (Tr. 44; GE 6)
SOR  ¶   1.b   alleges  a  judgment  was  entered  against  Applicant  in  April  2015  for
$1,506.  Payment  was  delayed  because  he  could  not  locate  the  creditor.  (Tr.  32)  He
employed a lawyer to assist him in arranging payment. (Tr. 32) On August 27, 2021, he
paid the judgment. (Tr. 31; AE 1)
SOR ¶¶  1.c  and  1.e  allege two judgments were entered against Applicant from the
same  creditor  in  January  2016  for  $503  and  in  February  2016  for  $1,270.  Applicant
satisfied the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c on November 20, 2020, and the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e on
December 11, 2020. (Tr. 38-39; SOR response at 3; AE 2-3)
SOR  ¶¶   1.d   and   1.g  allege  two  judgments  for  city  tax  debts  entered  against
Applicant  in  February  2016  for  $62  and  in  February  2018  for  $62.  (AE  5)  Applicant
asserted he did not owe the two debts, and that he had a letter showing payment for the
first  one  in  February  2016.  (Tr.  35,  41)  He  did  not  provide  a  copy  of  the  letter.  On
December 28, 2020, he satisfied the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.d, and on December 16, 2020,
he satisfied the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.g. (Tr. 40-41; AE 6)
SOR  ¶  1.f   alleges  a judgment was  entered against  Applicant in  March  2017 for
$1,698. On May 3, 2021, he satisfied the judgment. (Tr. 40; AE 4)
SOR ¶¶  1.h  and  1.i  allege two charged-off debts for $451 and $863. On November

$353. On December 2, 2020, the creditor for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.j wrote that the account
was  settled  for  less  than  the  full  balance  on  November  30,  2020.  (Tr.  41-42;  SOR
response at 12) On November 14, 2020, the creditor for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k wrote the
account  was  settled  for  less  than  the  full  balance.  (Tr.  42;  SOR  response  at  13)  On
November 13, 2020, the creditor for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.l wrote and thanked Applicant
for meeting his obligation. (Tr. 42; SOR response at 14)
Applicant intends to avoid delinquent debt in the future. (Tr. 44) He has read at
least  two  books  on  investing  and  finance.  (Tr.  44)  He  has  educated  himself  through
multiple sources on how to maintain his financial responsibility. (Tr. 44) He has several
non-SOR debts, which are in paid or in paid as agreed status in his credit reports. (GE 2,

Criminal Conduct
The SOR contains the following criminal conduct allegations:
SOR ¶  2.a  alleges Applicant received nonjudicial punishment  (NJP) while in the
Navy  for  falsifying  dependency  documentation  in  order  to  receive  additional  financial
benefits. In his February 28, 2019 SCA Applicant said he received NJP in October 2014
for “failure to obey an order [and] false statements.” (GE 1 at 25) He was “found guilty,”
and he received 45 days of extra duty. (Id.) He said his command learned he was not
married when his former spouse called his command and informed them of the change
in  his marital status.  (Tr. 52)  Applicant  admitted  that he failed  to  update  his personnel
records  to  reflect  his  divorce.  (Tr.  50)  Applicant  told  an  OPM  investigator  that  the
falsification related to an allegation he was claiming “additional funds on his taxes.” (GE
13 at 2) He said it was an oversight, and he did not receive any additional benefits. (Tr.
52-53)
In  his  follow-up  September  17,  2019  OPM  interview,  Applicant  said  his  former
spouse was listed as his dependent on his military dependency document, which would
have  incorrectly  entitled  her  to  military/TRICARE  medical  benefits,  use  of  the
commissary, possession of a Navy identification card, etc. (GE 13 at 8) He received 45
days of extra duty, reduction to E-4 (suspended), and forfeiture of $1,213 pay per month
for two months (suspended) from his commander as a result of the NJP disposition. (Tr.
53-54; GE 13 at 8) There is no record evidence that Applicant received more pay due to
his records incorrectly indicating he was married in 2014 when he was actually divorced
in 2011. There is no evidence his former spouse fraudulently received medical care or
other  benefits  to  which  she  was  not  entitled  due  to  his  failure  to  timely  update  his
personnel records concerning his divorce.
SOR  ¶   2.b  alleges  Applicant   pleaded   no   contest  for  violation   of  a   custody   or
protection  order in  February  2016.  Applicant said from  2012  to  2017, his former spouse
“literally   made   [his]  life   a   living   hell   by   filing   false  undocumented   claims  of   things  like
abuse, stalking, kidnapping, just  –  you  name  it.  Anything  regarding  her and  the  children,
she  filed  it.” (Tr. 55)  She  alleged  that he  beat his children  with  a  belt,  punched  his eight-
year-old  son,  and   that  he   hit  his  son’s  head   against  a   concrete   wall,   giving   him   a
concussion. (Tr. 61-62)  Applicant claimed  the  judge  told him  that a  no  contest plea, “Well,
it doesn’t mean  you’re   guilty   or not guilty   . .  . but we  can  conclude   this case   –  by  that
plea.” (Tr. 56) Applicant decided  that it would be  best to  expedite  resolution  of  the  charge
with  a  no  contest plea. (Tr. 56) He received  a  fine  and  a  suspended  jail  sentence. (Tr. 56)
A  child protective  service  investigation  decided  her allegations  of physical  abuse  were
unfounded. (Tr. 62) The Navy based his discharge on his conviction. (Tr. 57) None of his
former spouse’s allegations of his abusive conduct resulted in convictions. (Tr. 55-59)
Applicant denied  that he  physically  abused  his former spouse  or his  children. (Tr.
64) In  order to  avoid conflict with  his  former spouse, Applicant has  ensured  that  he  has
not had  any contact with his former spouse since 2016. (Tr. 52, 60, 67)
Character Evidence
Applicant received  excellent Navy  evaluation  reports from  2011  to  2014. (AE  9-AE
11) He  received  a  negative  Navy  evaluation  report in  2015, which cited  his NJP,  and  in
2016,  which  cited   his violation   of   the   protection   order. (GE 13  at  8-9)  He   received   the
following   Navy   medals  and   awards:   two   Navy   Good   Conduct   Medals,  a   letter  of
commendation;   three   Navy   and   Marine   Corps  Achievement   Medals;  National  Defense
Service Medal; Global War  on  Terrorism  Expeditionary  Medal; Global War on  Terrorism
Service Medal; two  Sea  Service Deployment Ribbons; and  Navy  Expert Pistol Medal. (Tr.
20; AE  8, AE  12)  He  received  an  early  promotion  to  petty  officer second  class.  (Tr.  20)
He received a certificate of recognition, and his current employer has promoted  him.  (Tr.
20; AE  14) He received  a  certificate  of  voluntary  service from  the  state  public schools,
and  he is a state  basketball  official. (AE 15; AE 16)
