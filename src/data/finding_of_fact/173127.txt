Applicant  is  a  40-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  where  she  has
worked since September 2018. She attended college from about 2003 to 2004 and from
2012 to 2014, and she is again attending college in pursuit of a degree. She has never
married. She has a 21-year-old child. (Tr. at 19-20, 26-28, 41-42; GE 1, 5)
Applicant  has  a   history   of   financial  problems,  which  she   attributed   to   periods of
unemployment  and  underemployment and  being  a  single parent.  (Tr. at  18, 28-29, 39;
GE  1-5) The  SOR alleges 18  delinquent debts.  However, the  debts  in SOR ¶¶ 1.d  and
1.r  are  duplicate   accounts.   The   17   non-duplicative   debts  consist  of   seven   defaulted
student loans to  the  U.S. Department of Education  totaling  $13,782; two  medical debts
totaling   $578;  a   deficiency   balance   of   $7,165   owed   on   an   auto   loan   after  the   vehicle
was repossessed; and  seven miscellaneous delinquent debts totaling $7,267.
Applicant  started  paying  her  debts  after  she  obtained  her  current  job.  She  paid
several debts before the SOR was issued, including debts that were not alleged in the
SOR. (Tr. at 20; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A, B, D, H)
SOR ¶  1.p  alleges a  $158  delinquent  debt  to  a  collection  company  on  behalf of a
financial institution. The  debt is listed  by  all  three  credit reporting  agencies on  the  March
2019  credit report, with  an  activity  date  of  February  2019. Applicant indicated  that she
had  two  accounts with  the  same  collection  company  and  financial  institutions (only   one
was alleged  in the  SOR), and  she  paid $400 on  January  3, 2019, and  $321 on  February
1, 2019, to  resolve  both  debts.  She  provided  documented  proof  of  the  $400  payment on
January  3, 2019. The  two  later credit  reports  do  not  list either debt.  I find  that  Applicant
owed  $721  on  the  two  accounts, and  both  of the  accounts  have  been  paid.  (Tr. at  36-
37; Applicant’s response to  SOR; GE 2-5; AE A, H)
Applicant asserted  that she  paid the  $2,224  and  $750  delinquent  debts (SOR ¶¶
1.k and  1.l)  owed  to  a  collection  company  on  behalf of the  same  creditor.  She  provided
two   copies  of   documentation   that  the   $750   account  was  paid  by   June   2019.  Both
accounts  were  reported   by   all   three   credit   reporting   agencies  on   the   March  2019
combined  credit report, with  activity  dates for both  accounts of March 2016.  The  debts
are not listed  on  the  December 2019  or June  2021  Equifax  credit reports. The  debts did
not “age  off” the  reports because  they  were not past the  seven-year reporting  window. I
find  that both  debts have  been  paid. (Tr. at 36-38; Applicant’s response  to  SOR; GE  2-
5; AE B, E)
Applicant  paid  the  $211  telecommunications  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.n)  in  August  2019.
She paid the $1,577 charged-off furniture debt (SOR ¶ 1.e) in April 2020. She asserted
that  she  paid  the  $368  and  $210  medical  debts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.m  and  1.o)  and  the  $147
public  utilities  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.q).  She  did  not  provide  supporting  documentation,
explaining that she changed financial institutions and no longer had access to all of her
records.  The  debts  are  listed  on  the  March  2019  credit  report,  but  not  the  two  most
recent credit reports. (Tr. at 36; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A, D)
Applicant initiated a payment plan for the $2,200  delinquent debt to a collection
company on behalf of a financial institution (SOR ¶ 1.d). She is to pay at least $50 per
month. She had not made the first payment when the record closed. The seven student
loans are in a pause mandated for all federal student loans through at least September
2022.  Because  she  is  currently  attending  college,  she  will  likely  receive  a  deferment
after the pause ends. (Tr. at 29-30, 34-36; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5)
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  a  $7,145  charged-off  auto  loan.  The  vehicle  was  purchased
and financed in about April 2013. It is unclear when it was repossessed, but Applicant
stated  that  she  thought  it  was  in  about  2014  or  2015.  The  March  2019  credit  report
indicated that $7,875 was charged off  in October 2013, with a balance of $7,415. The
December 2019 credit report indicated the account was charged off, with a high credit of
$14,869,  a  date  of  last  action  (DLA)  of  January  2015,  and  a  balance  of  $7,165.  The
June  2021  credit  report indicated  that  $14,869  was  charged  off  (this amount  does  not
add  up,  and  is  contradicted  by  the  previous  reports),  with  a  balance  of  $7,165.  (Tr. at
31; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5)
Applicant’s  finances  have  greatly  improved.  She  has  a  good  job  at  a  major
company  that  pays  her  well.  If  she  receives  a  security  clearance,  her  opportunities  at
the company will increase. Her child is an adult. She has not let any new debts become
delinquent  since  before  she  started  her  job  in  2018.  With  tuition  assistance  from  her
employer,  she  is  paying  for  her  current  college  education  as  she  goes,  without  taking
out  additional  student  loans.  She  received  financial  advice  from  a  counselor  at  her
college. (Tr. at 19-20, 29-30, 40-41; GE 2-4)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
February  2019.  She  did  not  report  any  adverse  information  under  the  financial
questions.  She  credibly  denied  intentionally  providing  false  information  about  her
finances. She inquired about how to fill out the questionnaire because there were things
that she did not remember. She was told to do the best she could, and if anything came
up  in  the  investigation,  it  would  be  brought to  her attention. At  the time  she  submitted
the SF 86, she had already paid two of the SOR debts and several non-SOR debts. A
number  of  the  other  debts  were  old.  After  considering  all  of  the  evidence,  including
Applicant’s  age,  education,  experience,  and  credible  testimony,  I  find  she  did  not
intentionally provide false information about her finances on the SF 86. (Tr. at 18-25, 34,
36; GE 1)
