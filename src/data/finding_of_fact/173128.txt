Applicant is 59 years old. He graduated from high school in 1981. He enlisted in
the U.S. Army in 1982, and served on active duty until he was honorably discharged in
1990. He received the equivalent of two years of college while in the military service, but
did not receive a degree. He married in 1985 and divorced in 1997. He married his current
wife in 2000. He has four children, ages 29, 20, 14, and 10.
Applicant’s work history shows he worked for a federal contractor between 2004
and July 2017. During this period, he was granted eligibility for a clearance. He was hired
by  a  federal  contractor  in  July  2017,  and  was  terminated  from  his  position  when  his
eligibility  for  access  to  sensitive  compartmented  information  (SCI)  was  suspended.  In
August 2017, Applicant used  his then employer’s (Agency) computer system  to  search
for  Gamblers  Anonymous  (GA)  locations  near  him.  He  also  sent  several  emails
referencing  gambling  transactions,  a  cash  withdrawal  from  a  monetary  investment
vehicle,  and  communicated  relationship  problems  speaking  of  separation,  filing
bankruptcy, and credit card debt. (GE 12)
After  his  termination,  Applicant  was  unemployed  between  November  2017  and
February  2018,  when  he  was  hired  by  another  federal  contractor.  Since  then,  he  has
worked for three different federal contractors. He was hired by his current employer and
clearance sponsor in November 2021. (2018 SCA; Tr. 19-23)
Applicant  submitted  his  most  recent  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  on
February  15,  2018,  seeking  the  continuation-reinstatement  of  his  clearance  eligibility
required for his job. In his answers to Section 25 (Investigations and Clearance Record)
of  his  2018  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  that  the  Agency  suspended  his  SCI  eligibility,
because of the financial considerations concerns that were subsequently alleged in the
SOR.
In his answers to Section 26 (Financial Record), Applicant answered “NO” to the
following questions: (1) In the last seven years, have you filed a petition under any chapter
of the bankruptcy code? (2) Gambling - “Have you ever experienced financial problems
due to gambling?” and (3) Taxes – “In the last seven years have you failed to file or pay
federal,  state,  or  other  taxes  when  required  by  law  or  ordinance?”.  Applicant  failed  to
disclose  in  his  2018  SCA  that  he  was  having  financial  problems  due  to  his  gambling
problem. I note that he submitted his 2018 SCA in February 2018, and he filed his Chapter
13 bankruptcy in March 2018.
Applicant  failed  to  disclose  that  he  was  experiencing  financial  and  personal
problems due to his gambling, that he had delinquent credit-card debt, and that he did not
pay federal taxes when due. He stated; however, that he had a federal tax debt and that
he had a payment agreement  in place with the IRS. In the SCA comments section he
stated:
My   finance[s]   took   a   beating   in  2016   when   I   receive   my   inheritance. We
spent  money  recklessly  . . . we  purchased  a  foreclosure  home  .  .  .  I  dumped
everything   I  had   and   then   some   to   build   this   house   up   .  .  .  we   also   took
several weekend  trips and  I  took a  cruise  and  my  family  took a  few  additional
vacations . . . I have  never been  late  on  any  payments  and  I am  still  current
. .  .  when  the  agency  pulled  my  SCI  and  I  became  unemployed  it  added  a
tremendous  amount  of additional debt  .  .  . I had to  take a  job making  much
less
The  SOR  alleged  that Applicant filed  three bankruptcies:  a  Chapter 7,  filed  and
discharged in 1996 (SOR ¶ 1.a); a Chapter 13, filed in 2009 and discharged in 2015 (SOR
¶ 1.b); and a Chapter 13, filed in March 2018, and dismissed in November 2018 for failure
to  make  plan  payments.  (SOR  ¶  1.c)  The  SOR  further  alleged  that  he  owed  the  IRS
$34,548 for delinquent taxes for tax year (TY) 2016, and $89,220 for TY 2017 (SOR ¶¶
1.d, 1.e); that he had five charged-off accounts totaling $37,326 (SOR ¶¶ 1.f - 1.j); and
that  he  engaged  in  significant  financial  transactions  to  fund  his  gambling  or  to  pay
gambling debts, and that his gambling contributed, at least in part, to his delinquent debt
(SOR ¶ 1.k).
Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified his 2018 SCA when
he answered “NO” to the question “Have you ever experienced financial problems due to
gambling?” (SOR ¶ 2.a) And, that he was terminated from his employment in 2017 after
his access to SCI was suspended due to financial considerations and personal conduct
security concerns. (SOR ¶ 2.b)
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations of SOR ¶¶ 1.a through
1.f, 1.h, 1.k, and 2.b. He denied SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 2.a. He explained that he and
his ex-wife filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1996 during the divorce proceedings because it
was the only way to split the marital debt to the point where they both could afford to live
and pay child support. (Tr. 23) In 2009, he filed Chapter 13 because he could not afford
two mortgages. After selling his residence, he bought a new home before the closing of
the sale on his old residence. Before the closing on the old residence, the buyer died, and
he ended up with two mortgages that he could not afford. After his savings were depleted,
he had a short sale on one of the properties and filed bankruptcy. (Tr. 23-24)
Concerning the 2018 bankruptcy filing, Applicant explained that he was financially
irresponsible. His father died in 2014 and his mother in 2016. He inherited a share of his
mother’s IRA, totaling about $467,000, and recklessly spent his inheritance. When asked
how much of his inheritance was spent gambling, Applicant quibbled and was unable to
provide a straight answer. His best guess was “over $50,000.” (Tr. 25-27) When asked,
what was the reason he filed a Chapter 13 in 2018? He stated: “Originally, it was because
all the debt that I incurred after [sic] through the gambling, through just reckless spending,
vacations, everything else, I figured let's start clean.” (Tr. 43)
Applicant claimed that when he realized he had a gambling problem, he dismissed
the 2018 bankruptcy to face his creditors because that was the advice GA provides in its
website.  Bankruptcy  court  documents  indicate  the  2018  bankruptcy  was  dismissed  for
failure  to  make  plan  payments.  (GE  4)  Applicant  explained  he  used  some  of  his
inheritance to buy a foreclosure home of about 6,500 square feet for about $465,000. He
claimed he spent between $50,000 and $75,000 refurbishing the home and purchased a
camper to live in for about four months while the house was being refurbished. (Tr. 29)
Regarding his IRS debt, Applicant explained that he failed to pay sufficient taxes
when he withdrew the funds in his inherited IRA. In 2016, he also withdrew the funds in
his $90,000 IRA. When asked why did he  withdraw the funds in  his IRA, he stated he
could  not  recall.  He  guessed  it  probably  had  to  do  with  paying  taxes,  expenditures  or
gambling,  or  a  combination  of  all  of  these  reasons.  (Tr.  34-35)  The  aggregate  of  his
inheritance, job income, and withdrawing $90,000 from his IRA raised his tax bracket and
increased his tax debt. He believes he reported income of $470,000 in 2016. By the end
of 2017, Applicant had spent all of his inheritance, the proceeds of the sale of a property,
and $90,000 from his IRA. (Tr. 35-36)
Applicant did not pay the proper tax rate for TYs 2016 and 2017. He contacted the
IRS, paid $10,000, and started a payment plan for TY 2016. Since then, he has stopped
his IRS payment plan twice and hired two different companies to help him seek an offer
in compromise or a settlement for less than owed with the IRS. He claimed he has spent
over $12,000 in companies’ fees without results.
Applicant’s documents do  not  show  any  payments  to  the  IRS  between  March  2018
and May 2019  and  between  January 2020 and November 2021. He believes these were
the  periods during  which  he  hired  two  companies to  negotiate  on  his behalf  with  the  IRS.
(Tr.  39-40) As of  his hearing  date, Applicant had  established  a  payment plan  with  the  IRS
in which he  promised  to  pay  $1,505 monthly. In  April 2022, he  increased the  payment to
$1,550.  He  owes  the  IRS over $32,000  for TY  2016,  and  over $91,000  for TY  2017. (Tr.
41) He  claimed he paid off his tax debt to  his state. (Tr. 42)
Applicant testified he did not realize he had a gambling problem until after he was
terminated  in  2017  and  the  2018  clearance  investigation  started.  After  the  2018
bankruptcy  dismissal,  Applicant  claimed  he  contacted  the  creditors  of  the  charged-off
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.h, established payment plans with both creditors, and
made  payments  for  a  period.  He  stopped  making  payments  for  about  six  months  and
recently started a new payment plan. He averred that he has been making payments for
the last year or so.
The status of the remaining SOR allegations follows:
SOR  ¶  1.f   ($15,887)  concerns   a   car Applicant  purchased   in  2017.   The   account
became  delinquent  in May  2018,  and  it  was charged  off. He  contacted  the  creditor and
established   a   $200   monthly   car  payment   in   2018.  He   has  been   making   payments   as
agreed since, and  reduced the  balance owed  to $14,487.  (AE  A and  B)
SOR ¶ 1.g  ($3,036) alleges a  personal loan  Applicant  took  out in 2017. He claimed
the  loan  was never delinquent,  but he  included  it on  the  bankruptcy  filing. The  credit report
of  March  2021  (GE  8) shows he  stopped making  payments on  the account in  May  2018,
and  the  account was charged  off. After the  bankruptcy  was dismissed, he  negotiated  a
lower pay  off  balance,  and  he  paid  off  the  account  on  March  31,  2022  (after he  received
the  July 2021  SOR).  (AE A  and B)
SOR  ¶  1.h   ($9,441)  alleges  a   delinquent   credit  card  opened   in  2017   that  was
charged  off  in 2021. Applicant claimed  he  was  paying  $235  monthly  and  reduced  the  debt
to  $8,200. He settled  the  debt for less than  the  full  amount and  paid  it off  on  March 3,
2022.  (AE  A and  B)
SOR ¶ 1.i  ($8,840) alleges a  delinquent credit card that was charged  off. Applicant
claimed  he  contacted  the  creditor before  he  received  the  SOR  and  settled  and  paid it.
The  documentary  evidence  shows  that he  resolved  the  account on  April 22, 2022  (after
the SOR was issued). (AE C)
SOR  ¶  1.j   ($122)  alleges  a   charged-off   credit  account.   Applicant  contacted   the
creditor before he  received  the  SOR  and  settled  and  paid off  the  debt.  He paid the  account
in February 2021, before the  SOR was issued. (GE 8;  Tr. 44-49)
In  his answer to  the  SOR and  at his hearing, Applicant  denied  SOR ¶¶  1.g, 1.i, and
1.j  because   he   paid   them   off   before  the   SOR  was  issued   in  July   2021.   Documentary
evidence  shows he  paid  SOR  ¶ 1.g  on  March  2022,  SOR ¶ 1.i in  March 2022,  and  SOR
¶ 1.j in February  2021.  (AE A, B)
Concerning SOR ¶ 1.k, Applicant admitted he engaged in significant transactions
to fund his gambling. He averred he did not have a gambling debt because he used his
inheritance  to  fund  or  pay  off  his  gambling  debt.  He  argued  that  his  gambling  did  not
contribute  to  his  delinquent  debts.  He  believes  that  losing  his  SCI  eligibility,  being
terminated  from  his  job,  being  unemployed  for  four  months,  and  working  for  about
$35,000 less than what he used to earn contributed to his delinquent debt.
Regarding SOR ¶ 2.a, Applicant claimed he did not falsify his February 2018 SCA
when  he  answered  NO  to  the  question  whether  he  had  ever  experienced  financial
problems due to gambling. He testified that he has been a gambler his whole life. He likes
going to casinos. Brick and mortar gambling was always something he did with his wife
and friends. They would go out to casinos two or three trips a year to have fun. It was
always a very nice environment, he traveled to nice places, and it was part of his social
activities. (Tr. 29-30) He claimed he always paid his debts on time.
Applicant’s claims of lack of falsification are not credible. In August 2017, he used
his Agency’s computer system to search for Gamblers Anonymous (GA) locations near
him. He also sent several emails referencing gambling transactions, a cash withdrawal
from a monetary investment vehicle, and communicated relationship problems speaking
of separation, filing bankruptcy, and credit card debt. (GE 12)
Applicant cruised  in  the  Caribbean  with  his family  in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017.
At his hearing, he  stated  that during  the  last  three  years, he  and  his family  took a  trip  to
another state, and  he  travelled  to  Puerto  Rico. He noted  that his wife  is accustomed  to
living  an  extravagant lifestyle,  and  she  took  at least three  more  cruises than  he  did. (GE
2) The  day  of  his hearing, he  indicated  his family  was in a  cruise, but that he  could  no
longer travel with them in cruises because  of  his gambling  problem.  (Tr. 56)
Applicant believes that what got him into financial trouble in 2016 was his online
gambling,  not  visiting  casinos.  He  stated  he  became  involved  in  online  gambling
moderately when his stepdad died in 2014. But when his mother died in 2016, he got into
online gambling heavily. He gambled every day, and the internet made it easy for him to
spend thousands of dollars right from his cell phone. Before he inherited his mother’s IRA,
Applicant  stated  he  did  not  have  the  money  to  gamble  because  he  was  living  from
paycheck to paycheck. (Tr. 29-31)
Applicant’s online  gambling  was done  with  overseas companies, and he did not
receive  any  IRS  forms W-2G  for  TY 2016  and  2017.  Between  May  and  August  2017,
Applicant  debited  $53,261  from  one  of  his  checking  accounts  to  pay  international
gambling businesses located in China, Thailand, England, and Shanghai. (GE 2) When
he  disclosed  to  his  wife  his  gambling  problems  in  2017,  she  filed  for  legal  separation.
Applicant claimed he has not participated in any online gambling since 2017. He admitted
he continued gambling in casinos for a period during 2018, until he decided to attend GA.
He also gambled in 2019 during a cruise with his family. He used the proceeds of the sale
of one of his properties to gamble during a cruise. He averred his “clean date,” the day
he stopped gambling, was September 22, 2019. He had gambled the night before, but
promised his spouse he would stop gambling. He testified he gambled again in July 2020,
and reported the incident to his GA sponsor.
Applicant  testified  that  after  almost  three  years  of  attending  GA  meetings,  he
realized  that  a  lot  of  the  negative  things  that  happened  in  his  life  had  to  do  with  his
gambling. Now that has learned about himself through GA, he realizes that gambling has
been an issue his whole life. (Tr. 31) He believes he accepted responsibility for every debt
he had and paid them off. He also believes he made a tremendous effort to correct his
IRS issues, get his clearance back, and support his family. (Tr. 18)
Concerning  SOR  ¶  2.b,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  was  terminated  from  his
employment with a federal contractor in 2017 after his access to SCI was suspended. He
noted that he is considered to be a valuable employee and received a clearance about
one year after he was terminated. He believes he has  demonstrated that he has been
trustworthy, open and honest with his peers, security personnel, and his company.
Applicant believes that his financial situation is good. He is current with his recent
financial obligations. He believes that his credit reports show that during  the past three
years he established a good credit payment history. Applicant presented no evidence to
show he  has  participated  in financial  counseling  recently,  other  than  when  he  filed for
bankruptcy in 2018.
When asked whether he had a gambling problem, Applicant stated: I don't have a
gambling problem now, but I will always be a gambler by addiction. It's something that is
not going to go away. It is something I have to continue to work on and be aware of, and
it is important to surround myself with a support system. But I can tell you without doubt
that  my  financial  problems  probably  for  the  past  20  years  have  stemmed  one  way  or
another from my gambling or inability to value money. (Tr. 57)
Applicant stated he intends to continue attending GA and to avoid gambling. He
promised to remain abstinent in the future. Notwithstanding, he is not currently attending
GA meetings on a frequent basis. Since June 2021, he attended one GA meeting during
the second week of February 2022. He claimed he was attending GA meetings until he
moved to his current residence. He stated that due to COVID-19, the three GAs by his
current residence have closed. There's one still available, and he went to it in February
2022, but he does not like the format. He claimed he stays in touch with his sponsor, but
with his stress, he acknowledged that he needs to go back to GA meetings. He claimed
he has not gambled since 2020. He stated he reads his book and stays in contact with
his sponsor. He presented no documentary evidence to corroborate his attendance of GA
meetings, or his conversations with his sponsor.
