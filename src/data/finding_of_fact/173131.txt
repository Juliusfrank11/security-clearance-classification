Applicant, age 39, divorced his wife of 12 years in April 2019, following a period of
separation that began in February 2017. They have three children: one child, age 14; and
twins, age 7. He has cohabited with another woman since 2018. He received an associate
degree in 2009 and a bachelor’s degree in 2013. He attended college for eight months in
2016.  As  of  December  2019,  he  had  spent  four  months  working  towards  a  master’s
degree in cybersecurity. He has been employed by a defense contractor as a senior cloud
security engineer since 2018. (Items 2, 3, 4)
Applicant was honorably discharged from the U.S. Marine Corps in 2014, after nine
years of service. He continued to serve on Inactive Ready Reserve status until 2018. He
deployed to Iraq for seven months in 2006, and to Afghanistan for one year in between
2009 and 2010. He was granted security clearances in connection with his military service
in 2006 and 2012. (Items 3, 4)
The  SOR  alleged  seven  delinquent  debts  totaling  $104,397.  In  his  Answer,
Applicant admitted that he was responsible for all but two of the debts alleged. He denied
the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g (a $39,536 past-due mortgage loan account). He admitted
to being responsible for only half of the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c (a $17,000 charged-off
automobile loan account). (Item 2)
The collection agent for the credit-card account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a obtained an
$11,063 judgment against Applicant in May 2019. He proposed a payment plan of $100
per  month  and  made  other  “offers”  to  resolve  the  judgment,  but  could  not  reach  an
agreement  with  the  agent.  In  April  2021,  the  agent  filed  a  garnishment  to  satisfy  the
judgment. Applicant was summoned to appear in court in September 2021 to respond. In
his  Answer,  Applicant  asserted:  “Because  this  account  was  included  in  my  divorce
settlement,  I  am  unable  to  settle  the  debt  in  a  lesser  amount  without  impacting  other
legalities.” He also stated that, in anticipation of his September court appearance, he was
saving  money  to  either  resolve  the  debt  in  full  or  at  least  reduce  the  amount  of  the
garnishment. The status of the garnishment was not indicated in the record. Applicant’s
October 2021 credit report referred to the credit-card account as a “paid charge off” and
showed a $0 balance. This debt has been resolved.  (Items 2, 3)
The collection agent for the loan account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b obtained a $4,628
judgment against Applicant in about May 2019. Applicant reached a settlement with the
collection agent to resolve the debt via a lump sum payment of $2,812, which he paid in
December 2020. He derived the funds for the payment from a $2,380 employment bonus
and savings. In 2020, he created a “small emergency spending fund” savings account to
which he contributed funds from his “increased earnings” and the decreased expenses
that  stemmed  from  “staying  at  home  more  due  to  COVID-19”  and  “overall  lifestyle
changes.” The record did not indicate the amount of his contributions or the balance of
the savings account. Applicant’s October 2021 credit report showed the loan account with
a $0 balance. This debt has been resolved. (Items 2, 3)
Applicant  and  his  ex-wife  jointly  financed  the  purchase  of  a  vehicle  during  their
marriage  for  her  primary  use.  After  the  divorce  court  initially  assigned  his  wife
responsibility for making the loan payments, she surrendered the vehicle as part of her
Chapter  7  bankruptcy  proceedings  and  received  a  discharge  of  the  loan  in  December
2018.  The  lender  sold  the  vehicle  at  auction  and  charged-off  the  $17,000  deficiency
balance, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. The divorce court ordered the parties to “equally satisfy”
any deficiency balance. In his SOR answer, Applicant stated that he planned to negotiate
a payment plan to resolve the full amount of this debt since his ex-wife has been unwilling
to  satisfy  this  debt  “without  further  court  involvement.”  His  October  2021  credit  report
indicated  no  change  in  the  alleged  balance  on  this  loan  account.  This  debt  remains
unresolved. (Items 2 – 4, 6 – 8)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d is a credit-card account with a delinquent balance
of $18,695 that the creditor charged off in about May 2019. Applicant has been paying
$187 per month towards this debt since at least August 2019. Although this debt is not
yet resolved, the reduced balance of $13,646 on Applicant’s October 2021 credit report
shows that he has been complying with the payment plan. (Items 2 – 8)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e is a credit-card account with a delinquent balance
of $12,911 that the creditor charged off in about May 2019. Applicant has been paying
$130 per month towards this debt since at least June 2019. Although this debt is not yet
resolved, the reduced balance of $9,271 on Applicant’s October 2021 credit report shows
that he has been complying with the payment plan. (Items 2 – 8)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f is a credit-card account with a delinquent balance
of  $5,409 that the creditor charged  off  on a date not indicated in the record. Applicant
established a plan to pay $200 per month towards this debt in December 2020. He made
the  payments  from  December  2020  through  February  2021.  However,  he  missed  the
March  through  May  2021  payments  due  to  an  inadvertent  debit-card  issue.  He
reestablished the payment plan in June 2021. Although this debt is not yet resolved, the
reduced balance of $3,997 on Applicant’s October 2021 credit report shows that he has
been complying with the payment plan. (Items 2 – 4, 6 – 8)
SOR  ¶  1.g  alleged  a  $39,536  past-due  balance  on  the  mortgage  loan  for
Applicant’s former marital home located in State A. The loan became delinquent once his
ex-wife stopped contributing to the monthly payments after relocating to State B following
their  separation.  Applicant  initiated  action  through  the  lender’s  mortgage  assistance
program to save the home from foreclosure, but the lender only offered him the option to
make a lump-sum payment of $8,000, which he stated he could not afford. Despite his
efforts, he was unable to sell the home in time to avoid the December 2018 foreclosure.
Applicant never received any statements or other information from the lender following
the foreclosure.  In June 2019, the house sold at auction for an amount Applicant believed
exceeded the amount he owed on the loan at the time of the foreclosure. In response to
the  SOR,  Applicant  contacted  the  lender  who  advised  that  there  was  a  $0  balance
outstanding on the loan account and provided a December 2020 statement corroborating
same. Applicant disputed the account with the credit bureau agencies. In January 2021,
one of the agencies confirmed the account but reported it as closed with a $0 balance.
Applicant’s  October 2021 credit report also showed a $0 balance on the loan account.
This debt has been resolved. (Items 2 – 4, 6 – 8)
Applicant  attributed  his  delinquent  debts  to  the  tumultuous  period  in  his  life
between about 2017 and 2019, when he and his ex-wife were separated and divorcing.
Their divorce proceedings were complicated by the fact that they were held in his wife’s
new  state  of  residence  (State  B)  while  Applicant  remained  in  State  A,  by  a  protracted
custody  battle,  and  by  their  strained  relationship.  The  financial  impact  of  this  period
included litigation-related fees (including for his own attorney and a guardian ad litem he
hired to represent his children’s interests), travel costs, court-ordered child and spousal
support,  and  employment  income  loss.  Applicant  stopped  working  between  July  and
October 2017 due to the impact the divorce was having on his ability to focus at work.
(Items 2 – 4)
Applicant’s employment income was $151,600 annually as of December 2019. He
paid  $1,650 per month for child  support from  November 2017 through  June  2019.  His
child  support  order  ended  after  he  was  awarded  primary  residential  custody  of  the
children. He does not receive any child support from his ex-wife. He has paid $1,000 per
month  for  spousal  support  since  June  2017,  and  $1,084  per  month  since  June  2019.
Applicant’s recent credit report revealed no new delinquent debts. (Items 2 – 4, 6)
