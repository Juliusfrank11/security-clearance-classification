Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations.  His  admissions  are  adopted  as  a
findings  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence,  I  make  the  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He began  working
for his  current  employer  in  August  2019.  He is a  software  engineer.  He  is seeking his
first  security  clearance.  From  December  2016  to  August  2019,  he  worked  either
temporary jobs or was unemployed. From February 2011 to December 2016, he worked
for  a  different  defense  contractor.  Before  2011,  he  struggled  to  maintain  steady
employment. He is a high school graduate with some college credits. He is single, never
married, and has no children. (Tr. at 6, 17-18; GE 1)
The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his 2012-2019 federal income
tax returns, his 2012-2018 state income tax returns for state A, and his 2018-2019 state
income tax returns for state B. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c).
Applicant admitted  all  allegations in his SOR  answer. He also disclosed  his non-
filing   of  income   tax   returns  to   a   defense   investigator during   his   May   2020   background
investigation   interview.  At  some   point,  Applicant  submitted   to   the   Government
documents  showing   that  he   hired   a   tax   preparation   service  (TPS)   to   prepare   his  non-
filed  federal and  state  income  tax  returns.  A  July  2020  letter from  the  TPS  indicates  that
it  had   prepared   Applicant’s   2018   federal  and   both   state   returns  and   instructed   him   on
the   filing   procedure   he   was  to   follow.  There   is  no   further   documentation   showing   that
the   2018   returns  were  filed.  Neither  Applicant  nor  the   TPS   provided   documentation
concerning  the  filing  status of  the  remaining  tax  years, i.e.,  2012-2017, 2019.  (Tr. at  19-
20, 27-28; GE  2; SOR answer)
Applicant  explained  that  his  tax  situation  really  began  in  2008-2009,  when  he
realized he had a tax problem. This was during the time he was either unemployed or
he  was  working  low-paying  temporary  jobs.  In  2011,  he  was  hired  by  a  defense
contractor for an information technology position. During tax year 2012, he failed to file
his federal or state tax returns because he did not have the money to pay his tax debt.
Once  he  did  not  file  for  tax  year  2012,  he  continued  not  to  file  in  succeeding  years
because  he  did  not  know  how  to  make  up  for  the  earlier  non-filed  years’  returns.  He
claims  that  he filed  all the missing returns  with  the help  of  the  TPS  between  May and
June  2020.  He  failed  to  produce  documentation  supporting  his  assertion.  I  kept  the
record open by 30 days to allow Applicant to provide the documentation, but he failed to
do so. (Tr. at 18-21, 25, 39; GE 2)
Applicant testified that he is not a tax protestor and feels much better now that he
has filed his tax returns. He intends to file all future tax returns in a timely manner. He
claims  he  paid  whatever  amount  of  taxes  he  owed  once  the  returns  were  filed  and
processed.  He  current job pays  him an annual gross  salary of  approximately $70,000.
