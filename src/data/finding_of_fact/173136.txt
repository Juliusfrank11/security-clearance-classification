Applicant admitted all of the allegations in his Answer to the SOR. (¶¶1.a-d, and
2.a.) After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  64  years old.  He  was  previously married  from  about  1978  to  1990,
and he married his current spouse in 2013. He has an adopted son, age 31. He served
active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  from  August  1977  until  his  honorable  discharge  in
January  1982.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree,  with  a  focus  in  electronic  systems,  in
1982.  In  2009,  he  received  a  certification  in  systems  engineering,  and  in  2017,  a
master’s  degree  in  business  administration.  He  is  currently  employed  by  a  federal
contractor  since  mid-2021  as  a  principal  solutions  engineer.  Applicant  was  granted  a
secret  DOD  security  clearance  in  November  2018.  His  employer  has  sponsored
Applicant  for a  top  secret  security  clearance  in  order that  he  may  perform  specific  job
duties. (Tr. 9-10, 16-20; GE 1)
In  his  January  2018  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  had  previously  used
marijuana intermittently from June 1973 to September 2013, approximately a few times
a year. He listed that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future because he did not
like marijuana and his lifestyle had changed when he remarried in 2013. (Tr. 19-21; GE
2)
In  Applicant’s  April  2020  SCA,  he  disclosed  that  he  continued  his  use  of
marijuana  a  couple  times  a  year  from  2013  to  December  2019.  He  also  listed  that  he
had smoked marijuana with friends after a mass shooting took place in August 2019. At
the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  continued  to  use  marijuana  due  to  certain
emotional  triggers;  such  as  the  anniversary  of  9/11,  and  after  a  mass  shooting  took
place near his residence in 2019. He and his friends have consistently visited a historic
area of bars and restaurants for more than 30 years where the mass shooting occurred,
and they were traumatized by the event. From August 2019 to December 2019, he used
marijuana more frequently with friends and family to deal with the trauma. In December
2019, he purchased marijuana at a bar in this historic district. (Tr. 21-25; GE 1)
On  May  8,  2018,  Applicant  participated  in  a  background  interview  with  an
authorized  DOD investigator.  Applicant provided details about his use  of marijuana  up
to January 2013. He explained that his lifestyle changed after he remarried in 2013 and
he  stopped  playing  in  a  band.  Applicant  reported  that  he  had  no  intention  of  using
marijuana again in the future. (GE 5)
On  May  4,  2020,  Applicant  participated  in  another  background  interview.  He
admitted  marijuana  use,  on  a  yearly  basis,  from  June  1973  to  December  2019.  He
clarified,  however,  that  he  used  marijuana  on  a  “weekly”  basis  from  August  2019
through December 2019. He used marijuana more frequently with friends following the
mass  shooting  near  his  residence.  He  stated  that  he  purchased  marijuana  from  a
stranger in late 2019. He reported that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future.
(Tr. 27; GE 4)
During   the   March   2022   hearing,  Applicant   admitted   that   he   had   most  recently
used  marijuana a  “handful”  of times  between his May  2020  interview and early  2022. He
had   also  purchased   marijuana   once   since   2019.   Applicant   acknowledged   that  he   was
aware,  at  the   time   of   his  conduct,  that  using   and   purchasing   illegal  drugs  while
possessing  a security  clearance  was prohibited. In  January  2021, Applicant submitted  a
statement  of  intent   to   abstain   from   future   marijuana   use;   however,  Applicant  candidly
testified   that   he   had   used   marijuana   as  recently   as  early   2022   and   it  was  unlikely   he
would  abstain  from   using   marijuana   in  the   future.  He  has  never  participated   in  a  drug
counseling or treatment  program.  (Tr. 24-29; GE 3)
