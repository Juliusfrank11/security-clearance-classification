Applicant  admitted  some  of  the  SOR  allegations  (¶¶  1.d-1k)  and  denied  others
(¶¶  1.a-1.c,  1.l-1.m).  His  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  careful
review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  50  years  old.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  defense
contractor, since October 2015, as a weapons technician. Since 1995 he has worked for
defense  contractors  as  a  weapons  technician.  He  is  a  high  school  graduate  and  has
taken some college courses. He has never married and he has no children. He has held
a security clearance since approximately 1995. (Item 3; AE A).
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  2015  through  2017  federal
income  tax  returns,  as  required,  and  that  he  owed  $2,500  for  delinquent  taxes  for  tax
years  2013  and  2014.  (¶¶  1.a-1.c).  Applicant  admitted  in  his  January  2018  security
clearance application (SCA) that he failed to file his 2015 and 2016 federal income tax
returns. He also admitted owing $2,500 in delinquent federal taxes for years 2013 and
2014, and he claimed he had a payment plan with the IRS for these years, but he failed
to  document  any  plan.  In  his  May  2019  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  with  an
investigator,  he  admitted  not  timely  filing  his  2015-2017  federal  tax  returns  and  owing
delinquent  taxes  of  $2,500  for  tax  years  2013  and  2014.  In  his  April  2021  answers  to
interrogatories, he admitted not filing his 2015-2017 federal tax returns until April 2021.
His IRS tax account transcripts for tax years 2017 (filed in May 2021) and 2019 (filed in
July 2020)  showed  that  his  tax  refunds  for those  years  were  applied  to  his delinquent
2013  federal  tax  debt  (2017  refund  amount  applied:  $2,022;  2020  refund  amount
applied:  $1,210).  Other  than  this  information,  he  failed  to  document  payment  for  his
delinquent federal tax debts for 2013-2014. (Items 3-4; AE A, D, F)
The SOR also alleged that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in  November
2001  that  was  discharged  in  February 2002. He  also filed a  Chapter 13  bankruptcy in
July 2015 that was dismissed in February 2016. Applicant admitted these allegations in
his  SCA,  his  PSI,  and  in  his  SOR  answer.  He  explained  that  his  Chapter  13  was
dismissed  because  his  plan  payments  were  set  too  high  and  he  could  not  make  the
payments. (Items 3-4, 7; SOR answer)
The SOR alleged Applicant owed six delinquent accounts totaling approximately
$21,000.  (¶¶  1.f-1.k)  Applicant  admitted  owing  these  debts  in  his  SOR  answer.  The
debts are also supported by listings as delinquent debts in credit reports from January
2018 and June 2020. Applicant claimed that he established payment plans for all these
debts. He failed to provide documentation showing such plans. He further explained that
he was unable to address his debts because of several personal setbacks for a period
of time including, medical issues (e.g. multiple shoulder surgeries, eye surgery, and skin
cancer  removal),  dealing  with  family  deaths,  and  having  to  leave  his  home  due  to
drought conditions. All of the debts remain unresolved. (Items 3-6; AE A, SOR answer)
The  SOR  also  alleged  that  Applicant’s  home  foreclosure  and  some  credit  card
debt  resulted  from  his  gambling  losses  in  the  amount  of  approximately  $50,000.  It
further  alleged  that  Applicant  continues  to  gamble.  (¶¶  1.l-1.m)  In  his  SOR  answer,
Applicant denied both of these allegations. In his January 2018 SCA, Applicant admitted
that he had gambling losses of $50,000, which left him unable to pay his bills on time, or
at all. He claimed he has stopped gambling and sought professional help to do so. He
failed  to  provide  any  documentation  concerning  his  medical  assistance  in  this  area.
(Items 3-4; AE A; SOR answer)
Applicant  did not  provide  information about his current budget.  Other than  what
might  have  been  required  by  his  bankruptcy  filings,  there  is  no  documented  evidence
showing that he sought any financial counseling. (Items 3-7)
