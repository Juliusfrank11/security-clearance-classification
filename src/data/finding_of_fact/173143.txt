Applicant  is  32  years  old.  He  graduated from  high  school in  2007.  He  attended
college between August and December 2007, between January and October 2014, and
again from 2011 to 2021, but did not receive a degree. He stated that he completed winter
and  summer  sessions  in  2021.  He  is  working  on  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  cybersecurity
management and policy. Applicant married in May 2019, and he has two sons. (Tr. 5-7)
Applicant’s work history shows he was unemployed for seven months in 2006, and
worked  for  two  private  companies  between  July  2006  and  February  2008.  He  then
enlisted in the Navy, where he served honorably on active duty between February 2008
and September 2010. Apparently, he was discharged for failure to meet physical fitness
standards. (Tr. 8) While in the service, he received access to classified information. His
eligibility for access to classified information was carried over into his civilian job positions.
After  his  discharge,  Applicant  was  unemployed  between  September  2010  and
January 2011. He has worked for about eight different federal contractors from January
2011  to  present.  According  to  his  2019  SCA  and  testimony,  except  for  a  three-month
period of unemployment between June and September 2016, he has been continuously
employed  by  federal  contractors  since  January  2011.  He  was  hired  by  his  current
employer and clearance sponsor in March 2020. He is making about $95,000 a year. In
addition, he has a part-time job as a bartender, making about $500 monthly. His wife is
employed with a state agency and makes about $40,000 yearly.
Applicant  submitted  his  most  recent  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  on
September 3, 2019, seeking the continuation of his clearance eligibility required for his
job.  In  response  to  Section  20C  (Foreign  Travel),  he  disclosed  that  he  and  his  wife
traveled to Jamaica for five days during their honeymoon in June 2019.
In  his  answers  to  Section  26  (Financial  Record)  of  his  2019  SCA,  Applicant
disclosed he was “currently working on any financial debts that I have on my own in order
to purchase a home for my family within the next three years.” He disclosed the delinquent
car loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a (repossessed in 2018, and still owing $7,525). He disclosed
no additional financial problems or delinquent accounts. Applicant failed to disclose the
charged-off car loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b (repossessed in 2010, and still owing $7,000);
the six student loans alleged in SOR  ¶¶ 1.c through  1.h (owing $22,371); and the five
accounts in collection alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.i through 1.m (owing $4,524). He admitted all
of the SOR allegations with clarifications.
Applicant  explained  that  his  financial  problems  were  the  result  of  his  youth,
immaturity,  and  lack  of  understanding  about  his  financial  affairs.  He  believes  that  his
appearance at his hearing shows that he cares and that he has a clear understanding of
his financial shortcomings. He believes that he has been doing the things that he needs
to do to fix his financial issues. He noted that he wants to pay off his delinquent debts, to
make good faith [efforts] to pay them, and to show the Government that he can be trusted.
He stated he is not a threat to the Government. (Tr. 17-18)
The status of the SOR allegations follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a ($7,525) concerns a car Applicant co-signed for his then girlfriend, now
his wife,  in  2015.  He  testified he  had  some financial  problems  and was  behind  on  the
payments  when  the  car  developed  engine  trouble  and  he  surrendered  the  car  to  the
creditor in 2018. After that, he did not make any more payments, except for one in 2018.
He failed to present documentary evidence to substantiate his claims of contacts with the
creditor or of any payments made.
After his hearing, in March 2022, Applicant contacted the creditor and settled the
debt for $4,130. He promised to make 12 monthly payments of about $344 to pay off the
debt. He presented no documentary evidence of any payments made.
SOR ¶ 1.b ($7,000) alleges a charged-off car loan. Applicant purchased the car
when he was in the Navy in 2009. After he was administratively discharged for failure to
meet  fitness  standards  in  2010,  he  was  unemployed  for  about  five  months,  could  not
make the car payments, and the car was repossessed. He presented no documentary
evidence  of  any  contacts  with  the  creditor  or  of  any  payments  made  since  2010.  He
believes he is no longer financially responsible for the debt because it was dropped from
his credit report. This debt is unresolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.h alleged six student loans in collection, totaling $22,371.
Applicant  claimed  he  had  been  in  contact  with  the  Department  of  Education  (DOE)  to
have  the  loans deferred  because he  was  attending college, but decided to  establish a
monthly payment arrangement. He presented no documentary evidence of his contacts
with the DOE, or of any payment arrangements made.
I note that Applicant’s student loans are currently in forbearance. In April 2022, the
DOE  extended  the  student  loan  payment  pause  through  August  31,  2022.  The  pause
includes the following relief measures for eligible loans: a suspension of loan payments,
a 0% interest rate, and stopped collections on defaulted loans. The Federal Student Aid
began  accepting  and  reviewing  applications  from  borrowers  seeking  loan  forgiveness
under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program in the fall of 2017. Applicant
presented no evidence to show that he had applied for student loan forgiveness; however,
because of the forbearance, I find the student loans allegations for Applicant.
SOR ¶ 1.i ($1,502) alleges a delinquent lease in collection. Applicant explained he
broke the lease  to move to a more affordable apartment. He claimed he subsequently
settled and paid the delinquent account. He presented no documentary evidence of any
contacts  with  the  creditor,  of  any  payments  made  toward  this  debt  after  he  broke  the
lease, or of other efforts to resolve the debt. (Tr. 25-26)
SOR  ¶¶  1.j  ($584),  1.k  ($500),  1.l  ($207),  and  1.m  ($1,731)  allege  delinquent
accounts  in  collection.  Applicant  claimed  he  paid  off  these  delinquent  accounts.  He
presented no documentary evidence of any contacts with the creditors, of any payments
made toward these debts, or of other efforts to resolve the debts. (Tr. 26-28) I allowed
him additional time after his hearing to supplement the record with documentary evidence
to corroborate his claims. He failed to submit any additional documentary evidence.  (Tr.
27-28)
Applicant presented no evidence to show that circumstances beyond his control
prevented  him  from  addressing  his  SOR  debts.  I  considered  that  he  was  unemployed
seven months in 2006, five months in 2010-2011, and three months in 2016. He failed to
explain how these periods of unemployment or underemployment adversely affected his
ability to pay his financial obligations. After he was hired by his current employer in 2020,
Applicant has been making around $95,000 a year.
Applicant believes he has done his best to reestablish himself financially and to
pay off his delinquent debts. He believes that his financial situation is good. Except for
the delinquent SOR debts, he is current in his recent financial obligations.
Applicant presented no  documentary evidence of any contacts with creditors, of
any settlements made, of payment agreements established, or of  any payments made
before or after the SOR was issued, except for the settlement with the account alleged in
SOR  ¶  1.a.  He  presented  no  evidence  showing  that  he  has  participated  in  any  recent
financial counseling. He claimed he is following a budget, but presented no documentary
evidence of his working budget.
Applicant  stated  that  he  understands  what  he  needs  to  do  to  get  his  financial
problems corrected and to establish his financial responsibility. Applicant expressed his
desire to resolve his financial problems. He now understands the seriousness of having
negative information on his credit. He promised to resolve the remaining delinquent debts
in the near future.
