debts are for a credit card, two installment car loans, a personal loan, and a dental debt.
In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  some  debts  and  denied  others,  with
explanations.
The  SOR  also  alleges  personal  conduct  (Guideline  E)  based  on  Applicant’s
arrest  in  September  2014  and  plea  of  guilty  to  the  charge  of  possession  of  drug
paraphernalia. (SOR 2.a) SOR 2.b alleges Applicant falsified Section 22 of his February
2020  e-QIP  by  not  disclosing  his  arrest  and  charge  identified  in  SOR  2.a.  He  denied
both  allegations,  contending  that  he  was  neither  arrested  nor  found  with  any
paraphernalia in his possession. Applicant contends that he was unaware of what was
found. He remembered the officer writing him a ticket. The officer then instructed him to
pay the ticket as soon as he could. At the hearing, he recalled the officer writing him two
tickets. (Tr. 74) He was then free to go.
Applicant denied SOR 2.b as he did not remember the incident, specifically his
arrest, when he signed and certified the April 2020 e-QIP. He was 39 years old when he
filled out the e-QIP.
Applicant  is  41  years  old.  He  has  two  sons,  18  and  20  years  old;  he  has  a
stepson 21 years old, and a stepdaughter 16 years old. He plans to marry in June 2022.
He has been employed by a contractor in information technology (IT) since April 2017.
Before  his  current  job,  he  worked  at  a  call  center  for  three  months.  From  November
2016 to February 2017, he was unemployed. In addition, he was unemployed from July
2009  to  July  2010.  His  employment  history  includes  16  years  as  a  general  service
specialist. He has never had any problems with his security clearance that he has held
since  2007.  He  participates  in  regular  security  briefings  on  the  different  aspects  of
safeguarding classified information. (GE 1 at 12-20, 35; Tr. 14-20)
Applicant advocates his children’s participation in activities that increases their
perspectives and viewpoints on the world around them. He took them on a vacation to a
country  in  the  Caribbean  in  2011,  and  a  Latin  American  country  in  2017  for  six  to  10
days.  He  also  took  the  entire  family  to  another  country  in  the  Caribbean  in  2018  or
2019. He recalled spending about $1,500 on that trip. (GE 1 at 29-30, 48-50)
SOR  1.a   –   In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  the  debt  and
provided documentation showing the judgment, filed in February 2017, was satisfied in
April  2021,  after  he  received  the  SOR.  The  account  was  opened  in  April  2016  and
became  delinquent  in  September  2016.  Applicant  filed  an  identity  theft  complaint  with
the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  because  he  surmised  that  someone  had  used  the
card  fraudulently.  Applicant  did  not  resolve  the  debt  sooner  because  he  did  not  know
about it. He neglected to address the debt. (GE 2 at 2; GE 4 at 13; GE 5; Tr. 21; 48-53;
AE A; AE C)
SOR 1.b  – This is an installment car loan that Applicant admitted. The account
was  opened  in  October  2017  and  became  delinquent  in  October  2019,  with  the  last
payment in February 2021. (GE 2 at 3) The car Applicant purchased from this creditor
was  totaled  in  an  accident.  He  had  GAP  insurance  on  the  car. This  type  of  insurance
helps pay when the auto loan is more that the depreciated value of the vehicle. Though
Applicant used words in his testimony that he was fighting the debt, I find he was really
trying to  negotiate  with  ‘Silver Rock’ GAP  insurance  company  on the amount he would
have  to  pay  under  the  policy.  Applicant  testified  that  he  had  a  formal  payment
agreement  with  the  creditor  that  began  in  February  2021.  He  believed  that  he  could
provide  documentation  of  the  agreement.  No  independent  proof  was  provided.  His
intentions  of  paying  consistently  under  the  agreement  were  thwarted  by  his  marital
plans and other obligations. He claimed he had been making payments on the account
until just before the Christmas holidays of 2021, but supplied documentary proof of one
$154  payment  in  February  2021.  After  the  hearing,  Applicant  provided  an  undated
statement indicating that the account was closed on April 30, 2019, with a zero balance.
The  unanswered  question  is  how  the  charged  off  account  got  resolved  with  a  zero
balance on April 30, 2019. (GE 4 at 9; Tr. 22-23, 53-59; AE B, M)
SOR 1.c –  This account was for a line of credit that was opened in December
2015  and  became  delinquent  in  April  2016.  Applicant  denied  he  opened  this  account.
He reported this debt to the IRS claiming identity theft. Tax refunds were somehow used
to pay for items on his credit report that he did not recognize. No additional information
was  provided  concerning  his  identity  theft  claim.  In  February 2022,  Applicant  disputed
this account with a credit service, but testified he was still making payments on the debt.
He supplied undated paperwork indicating the  disputed account was closed on July 1,
2016 with a zero balance. (AE M, N) The unanswered question is how did the account
close July 2016, with a zero balance, but he was still making payments on the account
in 2021. (GE 4 at 11; Tr. 23-24, 59-60)
SOR  1.d   –  This is an installment  car loan  that  was  opened  in  June  2014  and
became  delinquent  in  February  2016.  Applicant’s  documentation  shows  the  account
was  closed  on  June  1,  2016.  The  collection  agency  actually  sold  this  account  to  the
SOR 1.e creditor. (GE 4 at 13; Tr. 24, 61; AE M)
SOR 1.e  –  This is an installment car loan account that opened in January 2016
and became delinquent in October 2017. Applicant admitted owing this creditor. He filed
a  dispute  when  the  creditor  refused  to  fix  the  car  even  though  it  was  under  warranty.
When Applicant fixed the car with his own money, the car developed more mechanical
problems.  Applicant  called  the  creditor  to  repossess  the  car  because  he  was  sold  a
lemon. (Answer to SOR)
Applicant  entered  into  a  payment  agreement  with  the  SOR  1.e  creditor  in
February 2021. The terms were payments of $100 a month. Applicant missed payments
for  four  or  five  months.  The  February  22,  2021  payment  agreement  called  for  a  $200
down payment, seven subsequent payments, with a final payment of $12,997. He tried
two years ago and last year to dispute the debt. Then, Applicant testified that he refused
to  make  payments  on  the  debt  because  he  was  treated  unfairly.  His  dispute
documentation shows that his reason for disputing the account was that it was opened
fraudulently.  The  result  of  the  credit  union’s  investigation  was:  “[credit  union]
investigated  [Applicant’s]  dispute  but  the  information  was  verified  as  accurate.  Other
information was  also updated.”  (AE  O) Applicant  registered his dissatisfaction  with  the
result. (GE 4 at 9; Tr. 61-63; AE D, O)
SOR 1.f  –  This is an account for dental services received in March 2015. The
account became delinquent in March 2020. Applicant recalled his dentist did some work
but  did  not finish  the  job  because  there  was  a  problem  with  Applicant’s  insurance.  He
had to go to another dentist to get the dental work completed. Applicant was told that he
could have this debt removed by applying the statute of limitations. He also paid about
$500  or  $600  on  the  debt  in  the  summer  of  2021.  His  documentation  shows  that  he
made  only  a  $106  payment  to  this  creditor  on  February  25,  2021.  Also  in  February
2021, he was advised by letter that this creditor could no longer sue him because of the
age of the debt. On February 18, 2021, Applicant then consented on a recorded line to
pay this creditor by regular electronic payments. (GE 4 at 11; Tr. 63-66; AE E, P)
When  Applicant  was  unemployed  in  2009  and  2016,  he  relied  on  his
unemployment compensation and his mother to pay his bills. Some bills were not paid
regularly. Other than the debts listed in the SOR, Applicant has incurred no new debt.
He  always  pays  his taxes.  He  never had  legal problems because of  not paying debts.
Applicant  believes  he listed  all his debts  that  he  was  aware  of  on his e-QIP. The  only
time  he  has  had  financial  problems  is  when  he  is not  working.  Even  with  employment
issues, he has always been trustworthy and would not betray the country. (Tr. 27-33)
SOR 2.a  – Applicant denied this allegation because he was never arrested. The
paraphernalia  found  in  the  car  he  owned  and  was  driving  did  not  belong  to  him.  The
offense  was  expunged.  Even  though  he  received  a  ticket,  the  officer  had  no  probable
cause  to  stop  him.  Besides  receiving  a  ticket  for  the  paraphernalia  charge,  Applicant
received a ticket for having something wrong with his car. He was instructed to pay the
ticket as soon as possible and then was free to go. The offense was not in the forefront
of his mind because it happened many times before in the area he grew up. That was
why  he  answered  “no” to  the  questions alleged  in SOR 2.b.  I find that he forgot about
the offense when he filled out the e-QIP in February 2020.  (Tr. 34-36, 70-75)
Applicant  testified  that  he  talked  to  a  credit  union  adviser  and  a  financial
counselor, and will continue to talk with them because he does not want to proceed with
the  marriage  with  ongoing  financial  problems.  In  a  letter  dated  February  26,  2022,  a
minister  since  1999,  with  expertise  in  premarital  spiritual  guidance,  initially  talked  with
Applicant in November 2020 about spiritual guidance in planning for matrimony. In her
workbook  material,  she  stresses  the  importance  of  sound  financial  management  in  all
money matters, including establishing  a  budget  and monitoring expenses  on  a regular
basis.  Applicant  demonstrated  a  willingness  to  incorporate  these  financial  issues  into
the management of his finances. (Tr. 33, 87; AE K)
Character Evidence
Applicant’s  supervisor  at  a  previous  job  from  2001  to  2009,  and  from  2012  to
2016,  recalled  him  as  a  diligent  employee,  intelligent,  and  trustworthy.  He  always
succeeded in handling classified or unclassified projects. (AE G1)
The team manager of Applicant’s current employer in the mobility section, has
supervised  Applicant for the  last four years.  Based on  his security consciousness  and
trustworthiness,  the  supervisor  has  supreme  confidence  in  Applicant’s  ability  to
complete tasks in a timely manner. (GE 2)
On  February  8,  2022,  a  former  supervisor  from  2017  through  2020,  indicated
that Applicant always excelled in different working environments while making complex
information more comprehensible to audiences. (AE G3)
