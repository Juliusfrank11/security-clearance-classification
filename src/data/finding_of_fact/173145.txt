Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  with  explanations,  except  for  SOR  ¶¶
1.n-1.q,  which  he  denied.  The  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a
careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of
fact.
Applicant is 46 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since January
2020, as a satellite controller. From 2016 to 2019, he was self-employed with either his
own  or  his  wife’s  business.  From  2010  to  2016,  he  worked  as  a  laborer  in  oil  fields
located throughout the Western United States.
He  served  honorably  in  the  U.S.  Marine  Corps  for  eight  years  (2000-2008),
including  two  combat  deployments  to  Iraq.  He  also  deployed  to  Syria  as  a  contractor
shortly after he was discharged from the Marine Corps.
He  is  a  college  graduate.  He  is  married  and  has  two  adult  children  from  a
previous marriage and two stepchildren from his current marriage, ages 14 and 15. (Tr.
6, 18-20; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant:  (1)  failed  to  file  his  2019  federal  and  state  income
tax  returns,  as  required  (SOR  ¶  1.a);  (2)  owed  the  federal  government  approximately
$388,950  in  delinquent  taxes  for  tax  years  2011-2018  (SOR  ¶  1.d);  and  (3)  owed  his
state tax authority approximately $24,819 in delinquent taxes for tax years 2014-2015,
and  2017-2018  (SOR  ¶  1.e). There  were  two  other  tax-related  allegations  in  the  SOR
(¶¶  1.b-1.c),  however,  I find that  they are  duplicative  of  the underlying facts alleged  in
SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.e, and I find for Applicant on SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.c.
In addition to the tax-related allegations, the SOR also alleged Applicant owed 12
collections,  charged-off,  and  past-due  accounts  totaling  approximately  $98,382.
Applicant  admitted  in  his  July 2020  security  clearance  application (SCA),  in  his  March
2021  answers  to  interrogatories,  in  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  and  during  his  hearing
testimony  that  he  failed  to  pay  his  2011-2018  federal  taxes  and  owed  over  $300,000.
He admitted owing approximately $24,000 in state taxes in his interrogatories response,
his SOR answer, and his testimony. He also admitted that he has not yet filed his 2019
federal  and  state  income  tax  returns.  His  SOR  answers,  his  hearing  testimony,  and
credit  reports  from  September  2020  and  December  2021  establish  the  remaining
delinquent debts. (Tr. 22-24, 34-35, 39-41; GE 1-4)
Applicant’s tax difficulties started when he was working in the oil fields from 2010
to 2016. He was an independent contractor and was required to file quarterly estimated
federal income tax returns because he was not subject to employer withholding. He was
required  to  file  IRS  Form  1099s.  (See  irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-
employed/self-employed-individuals-tax-center.) He filed timely Form 1040s for several
years, but did not pay the  federal taxes owed. This practice continued when Applicant
and  his  wife  owned  and  operated  their  small  businesses.  He  has  not  filed  his  2019
federal  or  state  income  tax  returns.  He  explained  that  his  non-tax  delinquent  debts
resulted from  his wife’s overspending when  he  was away from  home  working in the  oil
fields  and  when  they  used  credit  cards  and  short-term  loans  to  fund  their  small
businesses. (Tr. 22-24, 32, 35, 39, 41)
The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
SOR ¶¶  1.a,  1.d  and 1.e  (non-filed 2019  federal and state income  tax  return;
federal and state tax  debt)-$388,950  and $24,819. Applicant testified that he still has
not filed  his 2019  federal and  state  income  tax returns.  He  explained  that  because  he
sued  his  former  business  partner  in  state  court  when  the  partner  refused  to  accept
responsibility for the  company’s debts  as he  took over the  business from  Applicant,  he
has been unable to file those returns. He has hired a tax professional (TP) to handle his
tax returns. He stated that his TP is working with the tax authorities on payment plans.
He failed to produce documentation of any agreements or plans. He further averred that
he paid approximately $80,000 toward his federal tax debt in 2016. He did not provide
corroborating  documentation.  He  also  failed  to  produce  documentation  evidencing  his
lawsuit against his former business partner. His stated plan to address this tax debt is to
sell  a  home  he  owns  with  a  market  value  of  between  $575,000  and  $650,000.  His
current  mortgage  on  the  house  is  approximately  $275,000  and  he  owes  between
$25,000  and  $40,000  for  delinquent  monthly  payments.  (Tr.  23-24,  28,  34-35,  39-40,
51)
SOR  ¶   1.f   (past-due   mortgage)-$21,062.  Applicant  admitted  this  delinquent
debt. As stated above, this delinquent mortgage is the house Applicant plans to sell to
pay his tax debt. He is $25,000 to $40,000 behind on his mortgage payments. The IRS
has placed a lien on this property. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 25, 28, 51; SOR answer)
SOR  ¶   1.g   (credit-card   debt)-$9,081.  Applicant  admitted  this  delinquent  debt.
He claimed that his wife set up a payment plan with the creditor. He failed to document
any  payment  agreements  or  payments  made.  This  debt  is  unresolved.  (Tr.  43;  SOR
answer)
SOR ¶  1.h  (personal  loan)-$4,468. Applicant admitted this delinquent debt and
claimed  that  he  had  paid  the  amount  down  to  around  $1,500.  He  failed  to  offer
documentation of any payments made to the creditor. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 44;
SOR answer)
SOR  ¶   1.i   (credit-card   debt)-$2,112.  Applicant  admitted  this debt, but failed  to
document  any  payment  agreements  or  payments  made.  This  debt  is  unresolved.  (Tr.
42; SOR answer)
SOR ¶¶  1.j  and 1.k  (medical debts)-$1,469  and $779. Applicant admitted these
delinquent medical debts, but claimed he paid these debts, and when contacted by the
creditor, he wrote a dispute letter. He stated he would provide proof of payments and a
copy  of  the  dispute  letter,  but  he  did  not.  These  debts  are  unresolved.  (Tr.  42;  SOR
answer)
SOR  ¶   1.l   (consumer   debt)-$435.  Applicant  admitted  this  delinquent  debt.  He
has  not  made  any  attempts  to  pay  this  debt.  This  debt  is  unresolved.  (Tr.  44;  SOR
answer)
SOR  ¶   1.m   (medical   debt)-$186.  Applicant  admitted  this  was  a  delinquent
medical debt and that it was being settled. He failed to produce evidence of a settlement
arrangement. This debt is unresolved. (SOR answer)
SOR  ¶¶   1.n-1.q   (four   debts   related  to   Applicant’s   small   business)-$12,593;
$26,057;  $6,940;   $13,200.
Applicant  admitted  that  he  incurred  all  these  debts  for  his
small business that he operated from 2017 to 2019. He claims that his business partner
took  over  the  business  in  approximately  2019  and  part  of  the  agreement  was  for  the
business partner to assume all the business debt. The partner failed to take on the debt,
and Applicant claims he filed a lawsuit against the partner. Applicant claimed he could
provide  a  copy  of  the  court  documents  to  substantiate  his  dispute  with  the  former
partner, but he failed to do so. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 32; AE B)
Applicant produced character letters from two military officers, a retired Air Force
brigadier  general  and  an  active  duty  United  States  Space  Force  (USSF)  lieutenant
colonel. Neither have worked with him, but have had other contacts with him. They both
believe  Applicant  to  be  an  outstanding  member  of  the  community  and  a  dedicated
family man. (AE A).
