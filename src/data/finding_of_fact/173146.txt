In  his  Answer, Applicant admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a –  1.h, and  1.k,  and  denied  SOR  ¶¶
1.i   –   1.j,  all   without  explanations.   Applicant’s  admissions  are  incorporated   into   the
findings  of   fact.   After  a   thorough   and   careful  review   of   the   pleadings  and   evidence
submitted, I make the  following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 57 years old. He has been employed as an airplane mechanic by a
defense contractor since 2020. This is his first application for a  security clearance. He
graduated  high  school  in  1982.  He  has  been  married  since  1984,  and  has  one  adult
daughter, and two adult step-children. (Item 3)
Applicant has had several periods of unemployment. He was laid off from his job
of ten years in December 2017, and was then unemployed until June 2018. He became
reemployed  for  about  seven  months,  but  left  that  job  in  January  2019  because  there
was  not  enough  work  for him,  and he had a long commute. He  obtained  a new job  in
March 2019 for about eight months, but lost it due to budget cuts. He was unemployed
from November 2019 to August 2020, before obtaining his current job. He asserts that
these periods of unemployment caused him financial distress. (Items 2, 3, 4)
In  his  background  interview,  Applicant  stated  that  when  his  bills  became
delinquent, he worked with his creditors to continue making payments. However, he did
not  provide  specific
information  about  how  he  worked  with  his  creditors,  or
documentation  of  these  efforts.  He  stated  that  despite  working  with  them,  some
creditors sent his accounts to collection. (Item 4)
In his FORM Response, Applicant stated that he began paying off creditors as he
could.  He  claimed  that  he  has  done  very  well  in  satisfying  most  of  his  debts,  and  will
continue  to  pay  them  until  they  are  all  settled.  He  did  not  provide  any  substantiating
documentation  of  his  payments  or  resolution  of  specific  debts.  With  his  Response,  he
included two screen shots from his phone,  purporting to  show summaries of  collection
accounts from two credit reporting agencies. They appear to be from a phone app and
not from a credit report. The summaries provide no detail other than the creditor name
and debt amount. (Response; AE A)
The  Equifax  summary  Applicant  provided  with  his  FORM  Response  shows  that
he has three collections totaling $3,937. The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.k are listed, as
well as one debt for $58 that is not on the SOR. The TransUnion summary shows that
he has four collections totaling $6,105. SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.k are listed, and two debts for
$1,792 and $434 that are not on the SOR. Applicant asserts that the debts listed in the
summaries  are  the  only  ones  that  he  has  left  to  resolve,  however  he  provided  no
evidence of resolution of the other accounts. (Response; AE A)
The  SOR  alleges  eleven  delinquent debts,  totaling approximately  $75,000.  Five
of  these  debts  are  charged  off,  five  are  in  collection  status,  and  one  is  three  years’
delinquent. The allegations are established by Applicant’s admissions and the 2020 and
2021 credit reports. Applicant did not provide documentation to show the current status
of the SOR debts. (Items 2-6; Response) The status of the debts follows:
SOR  ¶¶   1.a   and   1.b   are  medical  accounts  in  collection  for  $202,  and  $58,
respectively. (Items 4, 5, 6)
SOR  ¶   1.c   is  a  debt  in  collection  in  the  amount  of  $2,693.  He  stated  in  his
background interview that he was unsure what this account  was related to, but did not
dispute  it.  He  admitted  the  debt  in  his  Answer,  and  it  remains  delinquent  on  the
collections summaries he provided with his FORM Response. (Items 4, 5, 6; AE A)
SOR ¶  1.d is a debt in collection for jewelry in the amount of $257. (Items 4, 5, 6)

(Items 4, 5, 6)

that he would research it. (Items 4, 5, 6)

SOR ¶  1.h is an auto loan that was charged off in the amount of $1,172.  It was
opened in 2011 and Applicant’s last payment was in January 2016. He reported that he
was unable to keep up payments on the car and surrendered it to the creditor. He stated
that he intends to pay this debt. (Items 3-6)
SOR ¶  1.i is a mortgage account that is three years’ delinquent in the amount of
$48,119, with a total balance of $204,959. It was opened in 2012, and last paid in April
2019. Applicant stated in his background interview that the loan was in forbearance and
that he was trying to defer payments until the end of 2020, while his financial situation
stabilized.  Applicant  denies  this  debt  in  his  Answer,  but  provided  no  documentation
showing the current status of the loan. (Items 4, 5, 6)

opened in October 2016, and became delinquent in November 2016.  Applicant denies

the loan.  (Items 4, 5, 6)

2020.  It  also  remains  delinquent  on  the  collections  summaries  he  provided  with  his
FORM Response. (Items 4, 5, 6; AE A)
Applicant  did  not  provide  any  documents  showing  that  any  of  his  debts  have
been  or  are  being  paid,  disputed,  or  otherwise  resolved.  He  also  submitted  no
documentation  concerning  his  current  financial  situation,  such  as  his  monthly  income
and expenses, his assets, or whether he follows a budget. He provided no evidence of
credit counseling.
