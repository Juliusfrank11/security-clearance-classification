The  SOR  identifies  five  allegations  under  Guideline  B  (foreign  influence)
applying  to  Applicant’s  foreign  family  members  and  friends,  who  are  citizens  and
residents  of  Iraq.  He  admitted  all  allegations.  References  to  the  government  exhibits
shall be to the typed page numbers located in the upper right corner of the page.
Applicant,  34  years  old,  was  born  in  Iraq  in  1987.  He  received  his  Iraqi  high
school  diploma  in  July 2008.  He  entered  the  United  States  in  May  2012,  and  tried  to
renounce  his  Iraqi  citizenship  when  he  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  June  2017.  He  was
informed that that the policy had changed allowing him to retain his Iraqi passport but
not to use it. He has not used his Iraqi passport since becoming a U.S. citizen in June
2017. (GE 2 at 5) He earned some college credits in 2014 at a U.S. community college,
but  received  no  degree.  Before  he  began  attending  a  university  in  the  fall  of  2020,
where  he  intends  to  complete  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  May  2022,  he  attended  a
community college. To pay for his education, he receives financial aid, a  scholarship,
and  a  monthly  check  from  a  friend.  Applicant  has  never  been  married.  He  seeks  his
initial security clearance. (GE 1 at 9-10, 16, 28, 73, 76-80, 89-90)
In  May  2018,  Applicant  was  working  in  the  United  States  as  a  mechanic.  In
April  2018,  he  was  hired  as  a  linguist,  and  anticipates  deployment  once  his  security
clearance  application  is  granted.  His  security  clearance  application  shows  a  gap  in
employment  activity  from  January  2018  to  April  2018.  He  was  unemployed  between
October  2014  and  December  2017.  During  the  period,  he  traveled  to  six  foreign
countries. Four of those trips were to Iraq, and each lasted more than 30 days. (GE 1
at 61-69) Between August 2013 and September 2014, Applicant was a security officer.
In  his  last  linguist  position  from  May  to  July  2013,  he  also  had  role  playing
responsibilities.  He  was  unemployed  in  the  previous  five  months.  For  a  two  month-
period  in  2012, he  worked for a  cleaning company.  From December 2008 to October
2011,  Applicant  was  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  as  a  linguist  in  Iraq.  His
supervisor during the period wrote a statement about Applicant’s good performance as
a linguist between 2009 and 2010. (GE 1 at 24; AE B). Before working as a linguist, he
was unemployed from January 2007 to November 2008. (GE 1 at 16-25)
SOR 1.a – Applicant’s mother is 52 years old. She is a resident citizen of Iraq.
She is  a housewife and  cares for the  family children. She  used to work on  the family
farm  until  it  was  destroyed  by  the  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Syria  (ISIS)  in  2014.
Applicant  has  weekly  contact  with  her  by  telephone  and  social  media.  He  sent  her
money from 2014 through 2020, but has sent no money in 2021. The mother has never
had  contact  with  any  government  or  military.  Living  with  his  mother  are  two  of
Applicant’s  sisters and  one  brother.  Applicant’s  mother does not  have  an  inheritance.
Instead,  she  obtains  assistance  from  non-government  organizations  (NGOs)  and  the
resources  provided  by  the  United  Nations.  Applicant’s  father  passed  away  in  2014  in
the ISIS attack. GE 1 at 29-34; Tr. 26-30, 45-46)
SOR 1.b – Applicant has a 15-year-old brother who is a citizen and resident of
Iraq. He attends an Iraqi high school. As noted in the preceding paragraph he lives with
Applicant’s mother. In  Applicant’s weekly  phone  calls with  his mother, he speaks with
his  younger  brother.  The  brother  is  unemployed  and  has  no  affiliation  with  a  foreign
government or military. (GE 1 at 30; Tr. 31, 46)
SOR  1.c  –  Four  of  Applicant’s  sisters  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Iraq.  The
32-year-old  sister  is  a  married  housewife.  Her  husband  is  an  unemployed  crane
operator. She has no affiliation with a foreign government or military. Applicant speaks
with her weekly by phone or social media. (GE 1 at 31; Tr. 48) Applicant’s 31-year-old
sister  is  a  married  housewife  with  no  affiliation  to  a  foreign  government  or  military.
Applicant has weekly contact with her by phone or social media. (GE 1 at 31; Tr. 49)
Applicant’s 20-year-old sister and his eight-year-old sister live with  Applicant’s mother.
In  his  weekly  contact  with  his  mother,  he  speaks  with  his  sisters  and  15-year-old
brother. (GE 1 at 29-34; Tr. 50-52)
SOR  1.d  –  Applicant’s  30-year-old  sister  is  married  and  lives  in  a  European
country  that  granted  her  refugee  status  because  she  survived  an  ISIS  attack.  She
stays  at  home  taking  care  of  her  newly  born  child.  Applicant  does  not  know  whether
her  husband  is  employed.  He  speaks  with  her  weekly,  probably by  phone  and  social
media  as  he  does  with  his  other  relatives.  This  sister  has  no  connection  to  a  foreign
government or military. (GE 1 at 34; Tr. 31, 49-50)
SOR  1.e  –  The  individuals  identified  below  include  friends  and  relatives  by
marriage. Those individuals will be identified here.
One  of  Applicant’s  close  friends  who  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Iraq,  is  his
brother-in-law (A). He is married  to  one  of Applicant’s sisters identified  at  GE  1  at 32.
(SOR  1.c)  He  has  occasional  employment  as  an  interpreter  with  a  NGO.  Applicant
contacts  him  monthly  by  phone  and  social  media.  This  person  has  no  connection  to
any government or military. (GE 1 at 41-42; Tr. 52-53)
Applicant’s  second  brother-in-law  (B)  is  the  crane  operator  married  to
Applicant’s 32-year-old sister. See SOR 1.c. Applicant speaks with him monthly when
he talks with his sister. He has no connection with any foreign government or military.
(GE 1 at 42-44; Tr. 53-54)
The  third  listed  foreign  contact  is  a  lifelong  friend  (C)  from  Applicant’s  Iraqi
childhood.  This  person,  a  citizen  of  Iraq,  currently  lives  in  a  European  country.
Applicant has not had contact with him in over a year. This friend is not associated with
a foreign government or military. (GE 1 at 44-45; Tr. 54-55)
Applicant  has  weekly  contact  with  his  cousin  (D),  the  fourth  listed  contact.
Their interaction occurs by phone and social media. This individual is a police officer,
but Applicant does not know his work location. He is considered an agent of the  Iraqi
state or local government. As discussed below, Applicant provided financial support to
this cousin and other family members and friends. (GE 1 at 55-56; Tr. 45-46)
Applicant  has  known  another  childhood  friend  (E)  since  approximately  2005.
He is employed by the Iraq army in the ministry of defense. The two persons converse
weekly or monthly over the phone or social media. Applicant provided financial support
to this person. (GE 1 at 46-47; Tr. 56-57)
The sixth foreign contact is the brother (F) of Applicant’s aunt. He owns a car-
parts store. Applicant contacts him about four times a year. He has no connection to a
foreign government or military. Applicant provided financial support to this person. (GE
48-49; Tr. 57-58)
The  seventh  foreign  contact  is  the  nephew  (G)  of  Applicant’s  other  aunt.  His
only  contact  with  this  nephew  occurred  when  Applicant  had  to  transfer  money  to  his
aunt. He provided financial support to this person. (GE 49-50)
The   eighth   contact  is  Applicant’s  uncle  (H)  who   is  married   to   his  aunt.
Applicant  contacts  him   quarterly.  This person   is unemployed.  (GE   1   at  50-51; Tr. 59-
60)
The  ninth  listed  contact  is  Applicant’s  cousin  (I).  This  person  works  in  the
residency office, and keeps track of foreigners who travel to and from an autonomous
region of northern Iraq. Applicant speaks with him monthly. Applicant provided financial
support to this individual. (GE 1 at 52-53; Tr. 60-61)
The   tenth   contact  is  another  uncle   (J)   who   Applicant  contacts  quarterly   by
phone  or social media.  This person  is a  farmer. Applicant  provided  financial  support  to
this uncle.  The  11th  contact  is an  aunt  (K)  who  Applicant spoke  with  quarterly  by  phone
or social media, but has not had  contact with  her  in over a  year. (GE  1  at 53-55; Tr. 61-
62)
Applicant  provided financial  support to  some  of  his relatives  and friends  from
his  Iraqi  hometown.  Except  where  noted,  most  these  individuals  are  citizens  and
residents of Iraq. The reason for the support was that these individuals lost everything
following  an  attack  by  ISIS  in  2014.  (Tr.  43-44)  It  is  surprising  that  Applicant  never
mentioned  this  attack  in  his  August  2018  PSI.  Instead,  he  only  explained  the  family
members  that  lived  in  tents  and  the  gifting  was  based  on  a  family  custom  motivating
family members to work together and share financial burdens. See GE 2 at 7.
Applicant  has  given  about  $18,000  to  his  cousin  D for  transfer  to  Applicant’s
mother  and  sisters;  he  provides  about  $10,000  annually  in  financial  support  for  his
mother (SOR 1.a). (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 62-63, 66)
Applicant  sent  cousin  (L),  a  citizen  of  Iraq  living  in  a  European  country,
approximately $2,500. He indicated he sent the money because, like some of the other
recipients,  this  cousin  he  had  lost  everything  in  the  2014  ISIS  attack.  Applicant  sent
friend  E  $5,000  and  another  cousin  I  $300  for  the  same  reason.  He  sent  his  uncle  J
about $4,000 to help pay his child’s medical expenses that the uncle could not afford.
He sent friend E $1,500 to help get back on his feet after the 2014 attack. (Tr. 63-64)
Applicant sent uncle J, referenced earlier, another $2,000. Applicant described
the  frequency  of  his  support  to  this  recipient  as  “twist.”  See  GE  1  at  57,  58.  (No
additional information was provided.)  He sent friend I $200 to give to his aunt  (K). He
sent  friend  E  about  $200.  Applicant  sent  cousin  I  $700  to  transfer  to  Applicant’s
mother. Applicant provided $2,500 to uncle J a couple of times. (Tr. 64-65) According
to  Applicant’s August 2018  PSI,  he  provided  at least $34,200 to relatives and friends.
(GE 2 at 7) Part of the money Applicant gifted to his relatives and friends in Iraq came
from his savings and from his friends in the United States. (Tr. 62-65, 80-83)
Applicant’s  most  recent  trip  to  Iraq  was  in  December 2020.  He  arrived  in  the
country on December 10, 2020 and returned to the United States on January 7, 2021.
He went to the country on several occasions in 2016 to determine whether any of the
victims in the 2014 hometown attack were members of his family. He indicated he lost
four family members in the 2014 attack. However, as noted earlier, he did not mention
this horrific event in his August 2018 PSI. Because of the unstable security situation in
his hometown, Applicant applied in 2018 to the International Organization for Migration
(IOM) for his family members to immigrate to the United States. (Tr. 67-70)
Applicant  has  no  foreign  property  or  financial  interests.  (GE  1  at  56)  Though
he owned a home in the United States in August 2017 (GE 1 at 12), he testified that he
owns no home or property in this country at the present time. He has about $20,000 in
savings, but no retirement account. He hopes to establish an account after he receives
his bachelor’s degree.  He initially testified that he had no close relatives in the United
States.  Then  he  testified  that  he  had  no  relatives  in  the  United  States.  When  asked
whether he was involved in his community, he testified “what is that,” then he indicated
that he was not involved in a religious or community organization. (Tr. 78-80)
If  a  terrorist  group  tried  to  exert  pressure  on  and  through  one  or  more  of
Applicant’s  foreign  family  members  to  get  Applicant  to  divulge  or  disclose  classified
information, he would not yield to that pressure. (Tr. 75)
Character Evidence
Applicant’s witness  (W) testified that he met Applicant while stationed in Iraq in
February or March 2009. W was part of an advisory and assistance team that traveled
around  to  train  local  Iraqi  border  enforcement  agents  (border  agents)  in  logistics  and
security. Applicant was introduced as the team’s interpreter for the next 12 months. He
supported the team on patrols through villages and forts. If the team had information to
exchange  with  local  border  agents,  Applicant  would  translate  that  information.  He
frequently  proposed  ideas  to  enhance  communication  and  interaction  between  the
coalition forces and the Iraqi locals. He taught the team different dialects of the Arabic
language. (Tr. 12-15, 20)
W explained that during his Iraqi deployment, about 70% of the time was spent
on  missions  away  from  the  military  base,  and  30%  of  the  time  they  were  inside  the
base to rest and replenish. W was armed during these missions, with body armor and
protective  equipment.  He  recalled  no  combat  incidents.  Though  W  could  not  recall
meeting  any  of  Applicant’s  family  members,  he  remembered  that  Applicant’s  family
prepared a meal and Applicant brought the meal to the team. (Tr. 16-20)
On March 3, 2009, the team chief  (TC) from December 2008 to March 2009,
indicated that Applicant was a level one interpreter with a commendable performance
record in executing interpreter duties with the border patrol officers and coalition forces.
Applicant displayed a promising future as an interpreter. In January 2009, he received
a certificate of appreciation for his service. (AE A)
On December 31 2009, a major (MA) wrote a recommendation for Applicant’s
admission  into  the  Special  Immigrant  Visa program  (SIV) based  on  his stellar linguist
service  between  December  2008  and  the  end  of  December  2009.  He  excelled  at
translating  discussions,  manuals,  and  other  documents.  He  provided  effective
assistance
the  maintenance  of  equipment  and  before  and  after  mission
responsibilities.  During  the  period  of  conflict,  because  Applicant  and  his  family  faced
threats  from  insurgents  hostile  to  the  Iraqi  government,  Applicant  constantly  wore
protective gear and concealed his identity to minimize the risk he and his family could
be kidnapped or executed. Applicant received a certificate of appreciation from MA for
his service to the coalition forces. (AE B)
in
On  February  2,  2010,  the  interpreter  manager  (IM)  wrote  a  recommendation
for  Applicant’s  enrollment  into  the  SIV  program.  As  MA  had  indicated,  Applicant
participated in over 400 combat missions and other mission-related activities with Iraqi
leadership and other prominent Iraqi locals. The remainder of this endorsement mirrors
M’s endorsement. (AE C)
On August 3, 2010, the commandant (CO) of the continuing education center,
wrote  that  Applicant  risked  his  life  on  numerous  occasions  in  patrols  and  forays  with
coalition forces. Applicant also trained Iraqi security forces so they could achieve more
effective security objectives. CO has no reason to believe that Applicant represents a
threat  to  the  national  security  of  the  United  States.  On  August  3,  2010,  CO  provided
Applicant a certificate or his support at the education center. (AE D)
On  October  10,  2011,  a  captain  (CP)  wrote  a  recommendation  based  on
Applicant’s  service  in  A’s  unit  for  three  months  in  2011,  and  his  service  by  MA  since
December  2008.  He  carried  out  linguistic  and  cultural  liaison  responsibilities  in  a
productive  manner.  He  demonstrated  loyalty  and  honesty.  (AE  E)  On  October  10,
2011,  Applicant  was  commended  for  his  honorable  linguist  service,  but  informed  his
assistance would no longer be needed. (AE F)
In an undated and unsigned recommendation, a squad leader (SL) wrote that
he was deployed to Iraq and Applicant was an interpreter who participated in about 400
combat missions and deserves significant credit for training the Iraqi police and army.
In  an  undated  unsigned  recommendation,  a  retired  police  detective  (PD)
indicated  that  he  held  positions  in  the  U.S.  government  at  some  time.  He  supervised
Applicant  for  a  two-year  period  between  2009  and  2011.  As  his  most  trusted
interpreter,  PD  helped  Applicant  apply  for  a  visa  through  the  SIV  program.  PD
recommends Applicant for a security clearance. (AE H)
In an undated, unsigned letter of recommendation, the assistant director (AD)
of  the  international  studies  program  commented  on  his  affiliation  with  Applicant.  AD
assisted  Applicant  in  the  selection  of  a  university  to  obtain  a  bachelor’s  degree.  AD
was involved in courses Applicant selected. He also taught two of Applicant’s courses.
Applicant  has shown  a  strong commitment  to  developing a  career in  the  international
community. (AE I)
In an unsigned and undated recommendation, a sergeant (SE) explained that
he  served  with  Applicant  in  Iraq  from  2009  to  2010,  when  SE  returned  to  the  United
States. After Applicant returned to United States in 2012, they resumed their contact.
SE  believes  Applicant  is  continuing  his  education  so  he  can  be  a  productive  and
dedicated member of the United States. (AE J)
On  July  15,  2021,  Applicant’s  point-of-contact  (POC)  handling  pay  and
personnel issues in late 2009, became close friends with Applicant and escorted him to
his interview to obtain a special immigrant visa (SIV). POC considers him a trustworthy
friend. (AE K)
On December 13, 2021, an Army National Guardsman (NG), who served with
Applicant in Iraq in 2009 and 2010, commented on his experiences with Applicant. For
the  entire  period,  Applicant  provided  effective  participation  in  the  success  of  the
coalition mission. (AE L)
In an undated recommendation, a former civilian police advisor (PA) contractor
was detailed to train local police forces, and relied heavily on the linguist assigned to
the  PA’s  team.  PA  and  Applicant  worked  together  for  months.  Applicant  listened
closely to the local Iraqis in meetings. During these meetings, he occasionally alerted
PA’s  team  when  he  believed  other  unfamiliar  linguists  were  experiencing  difficulty
translating  a  dialect.  He  also  took  extra  time  to  ensure  that  the  audiences  at  these
village meetings understood the issues for discussion as completely as possible.
Administrative Notice  –  Republic of Iraq
Iraq is a parliamentary republic that continues to evolve into a stable country.
The  outcome  of  the  2014  parliamentary  elections  met  international  standards  of  fair
elections  and  led  to  the  peaceful  transition  of  leadership  from  former  Prime  Minister
Nouri al-Maliki to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.
In  December  2019  because  of  the  constant  demand  for  changes  in  the  Iraq
political system, Prime Minister Adil Abd al-Mahdi resigned. A new prime minister was
confirmed by the Iraq cabinet in May 2020. He promised to improve security and fight
corruption.  Several  assassinations  later  in  2020  of  protest  leaders  and  a  well-known
researcher caused  serious  doubt  in whether the new prime minister would  be able to
accomplish his objective.
The U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens living in Iraq are at a high risk
for  kidnapping  and  terrorist  violence.  The  U.S.  Government  considers  the  potential
threats to U.S. government personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to
live and work under strict security guidelines.
A 2019 human rights report indicated that serious human rights problems are
still  widespread  in  Iraq.  Sectarian  hostility  and  corruption  at  all  levels  of  government
have  diluted  the  Iraqi  government’s  human  rights  protections.  Other  human  rights-
related  problems  include:  dangerous  conditions  in  prisons  and  detention  facilities;
arbitrary  arrest  and  pretrial  detention;  limits  on  freedom  of  expression  and  assembly;
and discrimination based on gender, race, and religion.
