unable
to  make  payments  on  several  of  his  debts  until  2019  because  of

The SOR alleges nine delinquent student loan debts totaling $33,758, which were
placed  for  collection  as  follows:  ¶  1.a  ($7,511);  ¶  1.b  ($5,145);  ¶  1.c  ($4,048);  ¶  1.d

Applicant’s  student  loans  were  in  deferment  until  2017  because  he  was  continuing  or
intended to continue his college education. (Tr. 26) In December 2019, he began making
$5 monthly payments as  part of  a  12-month loan-rehabilitation program.  (Tr. 27-29) In
March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Education (DE)
placed federal student loans in forbearance. On December 22, 2021, the DE extended
the student loan payment pause through May 1, 2022. The pause includes the following
relief measures for eligible loans: a suspension of loan payments; a 0% interest rate; and
loans.  See  Federal  Student  Aid  website,

car payments and  vehicle-related  expenses. (Tr. 49) Correspondence  from  the  creditor
was  sent  to   his  parent’s  residence   and   then   lost.   (Tr.   53-54)  The   debt  was  sent   to
collections   when   the   creditor  did   not   hear  from   Applicant.   (Tr.  53-54)  In   May   2019,
Applicant  entered   into   a   payment   plan   with   the   creditor,   and   he   made   $150   to   $200
monthly  payments every  month  from  June  2019  to  present.  (Tr. 46-50; AE  B) On  February

generated a personal financial statement. (AE  F) His current monthly salary is $2,850.
(Id.) His net monthly remainder is $465. (Id.) Applicant said:
I honestly have enjoyed working for the company that I work for. Ever since
I got this job, it’s  changed my life to where I’m able to pay everything off
now. Before I wasn’t able to. But working with this company I’ve been able
to  pay  everything  off.  With  my  security  clearance  that  would  help  me
tremendously to be able to go places that I can’t go, to make extra money
to pay off even more of my debt. . . . I’ve just been trying to pay everything
off and get my life together. So with this job it’s been helping tremendously.
(Tr. 63-64)
