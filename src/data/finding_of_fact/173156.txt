The SOR alleges Applicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax
years  (TY)  2007  through  2013  (¶  1.a);  that  she  is  indebted  to  the  IRS  for  delinquent
taxes for TY 2008, totaling $5,411  (¶  1.b); for TY 2009,  totaling $6,284  (¶ 1.c); for TY
2011,  totaling  $4,605  (¶  1.d);  for  TY  2012,  totaling  $4,432  (¶  1.e);  and  that  she  is
indebted to the  Federal Government for a tax lien  entered against  her in August 2016
for about $22,025 (¶ 1.f).
In her answers  to the SOR,  Applicant denied  all of  the  SOR  allegations  without
comment,  except  for  SOR  ¶  1.f,  which  she  admitted  and  stated  that  she  was  working
with  a  tax-relief  company  to  establish  a  payment  plan  with  the  IRS.  Her  admission  is
accepted as a finding of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the
following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is 69 years old. She has been married twice. She married her current
husband  in  1993,  and  she  has  one  adult  son.  Applicant  has  been  working  as  a  truck
driver for at least five different companies from 2006 to present. Her employment history
indicates no periods of unemployment or underemployment.  Apparently, she has been
working for the current employer since 2012. She is being sponsored for eligibility for a
clearance by a federal contractor. She stated that the Office of Personnel Management
(OPM)  granted  her  eligibility  for  access  to  secret  information  in  2008.  Apparently,  her
eligibility for access to classified information was not continued.
In her response to questions in Section 26 (Financial Record) of her 2018 SCA,
Applicant  stated  that  she  had  failed  to  both  timely  file  income  tax  returns  and  to  pay
federal  income  taxes  for  TYs  2007  and  2009.  She  also  failed  to  timely  file  federal
income  tax  returns  for  TYs  2008,  2010,  2011,  2012,  and  2013.  She  stated  that  her
failure to timely file income tax returns and to pay her taxes when due resulted from her
inability  to  get  all  her  tax  documents,  lack  of  information  or  lost  documents;  and  her
inability to find help to complete the income tax returns. She also disclosed that the IRS
placed  a  $20,000  lien  against  her  home  in  2016.  She  averred  she  hired  a  tax-relief
company to help her negotiate with the IRS and establish a payment plan.
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  an  OPM investigator in  December 2018.  She  told
the investigator that she did not file her TY 2007 income tax return until 2013, because
she was travelling frequently and had personal problems. She did not file her TY 2008
income tax return until February 2014. As of the day of her interview (December 2018),
she  had  not  started  to  pay  her  2008  delinquent  taxes,  about  $4,000.  As  of  May  11,
2020, she owed the IRS $5,411 for TY 2008. Applicant did not timely file her TY 2009
income  tax  return.  As  of  December  2018,  she  had  not  started  to  pay  her  2009
delinquent taxes, about  $6,000. As of  May 11, 2020, she owed the IRS $6,284  for TY
2009. (Item (9)
Applicant stated she did not file her 2010 income tax return because she did not
have  the  paperwork  needed.  She  indicated  she  needed  to  call  the  IRS  to  get  more
information  about  her  TY  2010  taxes.  She  filed  late  her  TY  2011,  2012,  and  2013
income  tax returns. She  believed  she owed  back  taxes for 2011,  2012,  and  2013,  but
she was not sure how much she owed. As of May 11, 2020, she owed the IRS $4,605
for TY 2011, and $4,432 for TY 2012. In 2011, Applicant earned $114,604, and received
an IRS Form 1099-C (Cancellation of Debt) for $1,668. (Item 8)
Applicant  stated  she  retained  the  services  of  a  tax-relief  company  and  was
waiting  for  the  company  to  settle  with  the  IRS  and  establish  a  payment  plan  on  her
behalf so that she could start making tax payments. She averred she timely filed her TY
2014  through  2017  income  tax  returns.  (Items  8  and  9)  She  failed  to  submit
documentary evidence to corroborate her claims about retaining a company to help her
negotiate with the IRS, and that she timely filed her TY 2014 through 2017 income tax
returns.
All  of  the  SOR  allegations  are  established  by  the  documents  in  evidence,
including Applicant’s SOR admission, her statement to an OPM investigator during her
2018 interview, and her answers to the DOHA interrogatory. (FORM, Items 2, 8, and 9)
Applicant  failed  to  submit  sufficient  documentary  evidence  about  her  efforts  to
contact the IRS, of any payment agreements established, of any payments made to the
IRS for taxes owed for TYs 2007 to present, or of having retained the services of a tax
resolution company to assist her with her IRS tax problems. The accounts alleged in the
SOR  are  outstanding  and  unresolved.  She  presented  no  evidence  to  show  she  has
participated  in  financial  counseling  or  has  a  working  budget.  She  did  not  present
evidence  of  her  and  her  spouse’s  current  financial  situation  (gross  monthly  income,
deductions, monthly expenses, and monthly net  remainder).  Without any documentary
evidence  of  his  current  financial  situation,  it  is  not  possible  for  me  to  assess  whether
she is financially overextended.
