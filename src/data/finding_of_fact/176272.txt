Financial Considerations

established by his November 20, 2019 SF-86; his January 29, 2020 Office of Personnel
Management Personal Subject Interview (OPM PSI); his December 19, 2019, March 20,
2020, and May 26, 2021 credit reports; and his January 13, 2021 SOR Answer. (GE 1

Applicant  stated  that  his  financial  difficulties,  “all  started  when  I  separated  from
my second son’s mom.” This occurred in “early 2019.” (Tr. 18) Applicant explained that
he  had  purchased  a  2018  Chevrolet  Silverado  truck  in  his  name  for  his  then  live-in
girlfriend  and  after  they  broke  up,  she  was  unable  to  make  the  payments.  Applicant
contacted  the  creditor  and  arranged  for  a  voluntary  repossession.  (Tr.  19-21)  The
creditor  sold  the  truck  at  auction  and  after  the  truck  was  sold,  there  was  an  $11,829
deficiency balance, discussed infra. (Tr. 21)

When asked whether he had sought financial counseling, Applicant responded,
“Yes and no,” adding that he had discussed his financial situation with a credit specialist
in  an  attempt  to  repair  his  credit.  When  Applicant  first  started  working  for  his  current
employer,  he  retained  the  services  of  a  credit  specialist  to  assist  him  in  regaining
financial  stability.  However,  he  was  unable  to  afford  the  approximate  “$100  monthly”
costs  of  this  service  given  his  income  and  expenses,  particularly  his  child  support
payments and monthly mortgage.  (Tr. 24, 33-34, 41-42)
During his hearing, Applicant  discussed his assets and  expenses.  He  stated  that
his monthly  take home pay is $2,880. He  broke down his monthly  expenses as follows:
(1)   mortgage   $1,520;  (2)   electricity  approximately  $100;  (3)   water   bill   approximately
$115;  (4)   car  payment  $740;  (5)   car  insurance  consistent  with  other  costs   $165;  (6)
gasoline approximately $260;  and (5) groceries approximately $400.  After paying all of
his  other  miscellaneous  bills,  he  stated  his  net  monthly  remainder  is,  “[r]eally,  to  be
honest,   nothing.”   (Tr.   30-33)   With  his  current  employer,   Applicant   is  able  to  have
“predictable” overtime. (Tr.  34-35)
Applicant  stated  that  he  is  “very  serious”  about  taking  the  necessary  steps  to
qualify for a security clearance. To that end, he has consulted with a realtor and during
his hearing provided the realtor’s name and contact information. He is prepared to sell
his  house  “to  pay  off  all  my  debt  to  get  my  clearance.”  His  house  is  appraised  at
“$345,000  to  $360,000”  and  he  owes  “about  $202,000  to  $205,000”  on  his  mortgage.
(Tr.  35-36;  AE  B)  Applicant’s  salary  has  increased  since  he  began  working  for  his
current employer and he has “approximately $5,000” in his savings account  as a result
of a recent income tax refund. (Tr. 39, 43)
