Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since about June 2018. He is applying for a security clearance for
the first time. He is either a college graduate or just a few credits short of a degree. He
is divorced with three children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 50, 72; GE 1)
Applicant  has  a  history of  substance  abuse  and  criminal offenses  related  to  his
substance abuse. He became addicted to prescription opioid painkillers after he injured
his  back  sometime  between  about  2008  and  2011,  resulting  in  significant  pain.  The
physician’s  assistant  who  prescribed
for
overprescribing “oxycodone, hydrocodone, and other controlled substances” to patients
he  was  treating  for pain  management.  Applicant’s  addiction  led  to doctor shopping for
prescriptions,  alcohol  abuse,  employment  issues,  marital  difficulties,  and  financial
problems. In addition to the opioid painkillers, he would sometimes drink between a pint
and  a  fifth  of  vodka  a  day  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a,  3.a).  (Tr.  at  18-38,  82-96,  126;  Applicant’s
response to SOR, attachments A, F, P, S; GE 1, 2)
the  medication  was
later  sanctioned
Applicant was arrested in May 2013 and charged with two felony counts of falsely
obtaining  a  prescription  in  December  2012  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  2.c).  The  essence  of  the
offense is that he obtained a prescription for a controlled substance from one provider
without  informing  the  provider  that  he  also  received  the  controlled  substance  from
another source. He pleaded guilty on June 11, 2013, to falsely obtaining a prescription.
The second count was dismissed. He was sentenced to up to five years in prison, which
was  suspended  upon  his  completion  of  probation  for  36  months,  and  included
conditions  that  he  complete  substance  abuse  treatment,  and  not  possess  or  use
controlled  substances  or  alcohol.  The  felony  was  reduced  by  the  court  to  a
misdemeanor  in  December  2017.  (Tr.  at  38-41;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR,
attachments A, G, H, N, P; GE 1-3)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  August  2013  and  charged  with  six  felony  counts  of
falsely obtaining a prescription between April 1, 2013, and June 10, 2013 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b,
2.c).  He  pleaded  guilty  in  October  2013  to  three  felony  counts  of  falsely  obtaining  a
prescription.  The  three  remaining  counts  were  dismissed.  In  January  2014,  he  was
sentenced  to  up  to  five  years  in  prison  and  $15,000  in  fines.  The  prison  term  and
$14,397  of  the  fine  were  suspended  upon  his  completion  of  probation  for  36  months.
Conditions  of  his  probation  included  a  drug  and  alcohol  evaluation  and  completion  of
any  recommended  substance  abuse  treatment,  and  to  not  possess  or  use  controlled
substances  or  alcohol.  The  felonies  were  reduced  by  the  court  to  misdemeanors  in
February 2018. (Tr. at 38-41, 98; Applicant’s response to SOR, attachments A, H, N, P;
GE 1-3)
Applicant  continued  to  abuse  opioid  painkillers  and  alcohol  notwithstanding  the
two  convictions  and  probation.  He  completed  a  36-day  inpatient  substance  abuse
treatment  program  from  about  February  2014  to  April  2014.  He  reported  that  he  was
drinking between a pint and a fifth of vodka a day  with the opioids. He was diagnosed
with  alcohol  dependence  and  opioid  dependence  (SOR  ¶¶  2.d,  3.a,  3.b).  He  was
advised  to  remain  abstinent  from  alcohol  and  recommended  upon  discharge  for
aftercare  and  outpatient  treatment.  (Tr.  at  40-43,  96;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR,
attachments I, P, R, S; GE 2, 5)
Applicant  did  not  follow  through  on  aftercare  or  outpatient  treatment,  and  he
relapsed after leaving the treatment facility. He found that alcohol enhanced the effects
of the opioids. He was driving under the influence of opioids and alcohol when he  was
arrested in May 2014. His blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was about two and a half
times  the  legal limit.  He  was  charged  with  driving under the  influence  of  alcohol/drugs
(DUI). He pleaded guilty to the lesser offense of impaired driving in May 2014. He was
sentenced to 90 days in jail, with the 90 days suspended, and a fine (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 3.b,
3.c). (Tr. at 42-46, 102-103; Applicant’s response to SOR, attachment J; GE 1-3, 5)
In  June  2014,  Applicant  was  found  in  violation  of  his  probation  for  the  2013
convictions,  and  his  probation  was  revoked  and  restarted.  He  was  sentenced  to  150
days  in  jail  for  the  June  2013  conviction,  with  all  but  three  weeks  served  at  a  work
release facility (SOR ¶ 1.d). He was sentenced to 365 days in jail for the August 2013
conviction, with all but three weeks served at a work release facility (SOR ¶ 1.e). (Tr. at
47-48; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
After  he  completed  the  work-release  program,  Applicant  resumed  abusing
alcohol  and  opioids,  including  oxycodone,  morphine,  and  fentanyl  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a,  2.b).
From about April 2015 to June 2015, he used heroin  during a period that he could not
obtain  the prescription opioids.  Heroin was  also  cheaper than the prescription opioids.
(SOR  ¶  2.e).  In  June  2015,  he  checked  into  the  same  substance  abuse  treatment
facility for inpatient treatment for 45 days. He was diagnosed with alcohol dependence
and  opioid  dependence  (SOR  ¶¶  2.f,  3.d).  The  facility  certified  that  he  successfully
completed the inpatient program in July 2015. He was then provided a 45-day aftercare
program. He was advised to remain abstinent from alcohol and opioids. In August 2015,
he successfully completed a workout-based life coaching program. (Tr. at 49-50, 51-57,
59, 97-99; Applicant’s response to SOR, attachments K, L, P, R, S; GE 2, 5)
Applicant did not use heroin after his discharge from the facility, but he returned
to  abusing  alcohol  and  opioids,  including  fentanyl  (SOR  ¶  2.b).  He  was  again  driving
under the influence of opioids and alcohol when he was arrested in December 2015. His
BAC  was  about  two  times  the  legal  limit.  He  was  charged  with  DUI  and  alcohol-
restricted  driver.  In  March  2016,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  DUI,  and  the  alcohol-restricted
driver charge was dismissed. He was sentenced to four days in jail and a fine (SOR  ¶
1.c). (Tr. at 51-55, 102-103; Applicant’s response to SOR, attachment M; GE 4)
There  is  no  evidence  that  Applicant  has  used  any  illegal  controlled  substances
after 2016. His  parents,  who  could  always  tell when  he  was  using,  have not observed
any indication of use in years. He returned to the workout-based program in 2016. He
enrolled  in  a  90-day  workout  and  addiction-recovery  program  in  March  2019.  The
program  “requires  at  least  90  days  of  commitment  to  strenuous  activity,  dedication  to
sobriety, and active involvement in [their] fitness, nutritional, spiritual, and life coaching
curriculum.”  He  continues  to  be  actively  involved  in  the  program,  and  he  sees  a
therapist   unrelated   to   that  program.  He   has  learned   to   deal  with   his  back  pain   with
ibuprofen   and   an   active   lifestyle.   He  is  motivated   by   his  children   and   his  faith   to   stay
clean.  He  has   disassociated   himself   from   drug-using   associates  and   contacts,  and   he
passed   numerous  drug   tests.   He  signed   a  statement  of  intent   to   abstain  from   all   drug
involvement  and   substance   misuse,  acknowledging   that  any   future  involvement  or
misuse  is grounds  for revocation  of national security  eligibility.  (Tr. at 59-65,  70-82,  100-
102,  107-121,  125-126, 135; Applicant’s response  to  SOR,   attachments O,  P,  Q,  T,  U;
GE  2; AE A, B)
In  2020,  Applicant  was  prescribed  a  prescription  opioid  to  deal  with  pain  in  a
tooth before a root canal (SOR ¶ 4.a). He did not enjoy the experience and did not use
the  drugs  again  after  the  procedure  was  completed.  He  stated  that  he  has  not  had
cravings for opioids in four or five years, and the short use of a prescription medication
in 2020 did not change that. (Tr. at 67-70, 94-96; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant stated that he does not believe that alcohol was ever his real problem,
and  that  he  never  really  enjoyed  large  amounts  of  alcohol.  As  such,  he  does  not  feel
that  he  has  to  completely  abstain.  He  describes  his  drinking  as  occasional  and
responsible. He stated that his last drink was in November 2021 (SOR ¶ 3.f). (Tr. at 45,
50, 65-67; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
August  2018.  He  reported  most  of  his  substance  abuse  and  criminal  history,  but  he
intentionally  failed  to  report  his  heroin  use  (SOR  ¶  4.b).  He  admitted  that  he  felt,  and
continues to feel, shame about his heroin use. (Tr. at 56-58, 103; Applicant’s response
to SOR; GE 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  June  2019.  He
discussed  his  addiction  to  opioid  painkillers,  including  oxycodone,  but  he  did  not
mention heroin use. He admitted heroin use in interrogatories in January 2020 after he
was specifically asked about heroin use as documented in records obtained by the DOD
from  the  substance  abuse  treatment  facility  where  Applicant  was  treated  in  2014  and
2015. He admitted at his hearing that if the DOD did not know about his heroin use, he
would  be  conflicted  and  it  would  be  very  hard  to  discuss  it,  even  at  his  hearing.  He
clarified that if he was directly asked about his heroin use, he would be honest.  (Tr. at
104-106; GE 2)
Applicant  called  three  witnesses,  and  he  submitted  documents  and  letters
attesting to his excellent job performance and strong moral character. He is praised for
his dedication, reliability, competence, enthusiasm, attention to detail, leadership, work
ethic,  trustworthiness,  and  integrity.  (Tr.  at  19-61;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR,
