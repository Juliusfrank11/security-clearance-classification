Applicant  is a  37-year-old  senior principal  aeronautical  engineer,  who  has  been
employed by a defense contractor since January 2009. (GE 1; Tr. 12-13) He has held a
secret  clearance  since  2009,  and  seeks  to  retain  it  as  a  requirement  of  his  continued
employment. (GE 1; Tr. 13-14)
Applicant graduated  from  high  school in June  2003. He was awarded  a  bachelor
of   science   degree   in   aerospace   engineering   in  June   2008   from   one   of   the   most
prestigious  engineering   colleges  in  the   United   States.  (Tr.  14-15,   39;  AE   B)   He  has
never married  and  has no  dependents.  He  provides substantial financial  support  to  his
parents  and  youngest brother. Hi
about $165,000  to  $170,000.  (Tr. 1  5-

During  summer  2005,  between  his  sophomore  and  junior  years  in  college,
Applicant was paralyzed following an off-road ATV motorcycle accident. Since then, he
has  been  permanently  confined  to  a  wheel  chair.  (SOR  Answer;  Tr.  18;  AE  I)  As  a
result, he suffers from chronic back pain in addition to fatigue and soreness. (Tr. 18)
Applicant’s pain management has improved throughout the years. (Tr. 24) When
he  returned  to  college after his accident,  the on-campus  medical  team prescribed  him
“some  prescription-grade”  pain  medications.  After  college,  his  doctors  prescribed
various  pain  medication  options  to  include  opioids.  He  chose  not  to  use  opioids  given
their  addictive  qualities,  especially  after  observing  many  individuals  in  the  spinal  cord
injury community become addicted to opioids. Rather, he chose to live with his pain and
take only over-the-counter medications like Advil. (Tr. 18-19, 42-44, 46, 61; AE K)
In  about  2008  or  2009,  Applicant  began  participating  in  an  adaptive  sports
program and met other wheelchair users who could relate to his situation. This program
offered  various  activities,  like  basketball  and  cycling.  Applicant  credits  his  association
with  this group  as  being  the  most  “influential or consequential aspect”  of  his recovery,
especially  when  it  came  to  managing  his  spinal  cord  injury  through  exercise,  which
enabled him to. reduce “a lot of the pain” in his back. (Tr. 19-21, 24-25, 44-45)
Applicant considered using marijuana to control his pain after learning of success
stories from fellow members of the spinal cord injury community. He stated most of his
pain  came from muscle  fatigue,  usually  in  his  back.  He  has  no feeling  in  his  legs,  but
does  experience  “a  lot  of  muscle  spasms”  and  found  that  marijuana  relaxed  his  back
muscles and spasms.  See discussion, infra. (Tr. 21-23, 44-45)
Applicant  still experiences  pain, but  it  is not as  severe  as  it  once was  and  over
the  years  he  has  developed  a  certain  degree  of  tolerance.  He  initially  tried  over  the
counter  medications  such  as  ibuprofen  and  later  marijuana.  Today,  he  does  not  take
anything for his pain except ibuprofen occasionally. Since  April 2019, he has not used
marijuana and has no intention of using it in the future. (Tr. 25, 46-47, 53)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant  self-reported  marijuana  use  on  his  April  25,  2019  SF-86.  (GE  1)  He
was  subsequently  interviewed  on  June  12,  2019,  by  an  Office  of  Personnel
Management (OPM) investigator regarding his marijuana use. (GE 3) He elaborated on
his marijuana use in his January 3, 2021 SOR Answer as well as during his testimony.
The following summarizes that marijuana use.
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from
about  March  2004  to  about  April  2019.  He  admitted  this  allegation  with  explanations.
(SOR Answer) He first used marijuana in 2004, at age 19,  on two separate occasions
while in college. A college friend “offered” the marijuana to him on these two occasions,
both of which predate his paralysis. He did not use marijuana after these two occasions
because he “did not particularly enjoy it.” (Tr. 26-28, 40, 56)
Applicant  did  not use  marijuana  again until 2011, after  receiving  his first medical
marijuana  card. He did  so  with  “varying  frequency” to  address his chronic back pain and
muscle  spasms   relating   to   his  paralysis.  (SOR  Answer;  Tr.  21-23,  26,  45,  56-57)   His
marijuana  usage  beginning  in 2011, “would have  been  on  average  once to  twice a  week
as needed.” He  added, “But,  like  I said, that  would be  on  average. But then  there  were
would  also  be  periods   or weeks, many   weeks  in  between   where I   wouldn’t  have   any.”
There were times when  he  did not use marijuana for months  or years  at a  time.  (Tr. 27-
28, 48-49,  54, 56; GE   3)  When  Applicant used  marijuana, it was typically  at home  or, if
with   other
the   wheelchair   basketball   community   at
tournaments. (Tr. 47-48, 54-55)
it  was  within
individuals,
Applicant’s  decision  to  completely  stop  using  marijuana  “was  more  of  like  a
phasing out.” He added that a side effect of marijuana use was dehydration. As a spinal
cord  injury  patient,  he  found  it  necessary  to  avoid  dehydration,  which  could  lead  to
bladder infections. Through exercise and a disciplined diet, he used marijuana less and
was able to mitigate the need for its use. (Tr. 33-34, 49-50, 54, 57-58) He had started to
reduce his marijuana use before he filled out his SF-86 in April 2019. (Tr. 54) Applicant
also  knew  that  continued  marijuana  use  would  compound  problems  qualifying  for  a
security clearance. (Tr. 52-53)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that Applicant purchased marijuana from about March 2004 to
about  April  2019.  He  “mostly  admit(ted)”  this  allegation  with  explanations.  (SOR
Answer) He did not purchase marijuana in 2004, but rather a friend in college offered it
to him on two separate occasions. The first time he purchased marijuana was  after he
received his first medical marijuana card in 2011 from a medical marijuana dispensary.
He  never  purchased  marijuana  “off  the  streets.”  (SOR  Answer;  Tr.  23-24,  28)
Applicant’s medical marijuana card expired in 2018. He has not renewed it nor does he
have any intention of doing so. (Tr. 24; AE J)
SOR  ¶   1.c   alleges  that  Applicant   used   and   purchased   marijuana   with   varying
frequency, from  about April 2009  to  about April 2019, while  granted  access to  classified
information. He admitted this allegation.  See  discussion under SOR ¶ 1.a  supra. (Tr. 26-
27)
Applicant  purchased  marijuana
for  pain  management  only  at  marijuana
dispensaries.  Applicant  did  not  share  with  his  employer  his  use  of  marijuana  for  pain
management stating, “some people probably would have been okay with it . . . others . .
.  may  have  some  objections  to  it.”  Applicant  did  not  discuss  his  pain  management
issues  with  management  primarily  because  he  considered  it  a  personal  issue  and
desired to maintain professionalism in the work place. (Tr. 29-31, 56-57)
If  his  clearance  is  renewed,  Applicant  stated  that  he  would  continue  to  abstain
from  all  drugs  in  the  future  to  include  marijuana.  (Tr.  35)  Applicant  takes  his  job  and
security  “very  seriously”  and  stated  that  he  is  not  a  threat  to  national  security.  He  is
trusted by his coworkers, management, and customers and has received promotions for
his work in support of the national defense. (Tr. 34)
Applicant  has  not  used  marijuana  since  April  2019.  (Tr.  53)  He  does  not
associate  with  anyone  who  uses  marijuana.  (Tr.  60)  Applicant  submitted  a  signed,
sworn, statement of intent, dated June 15, 2021, to avoid any future drug use or other
illegal  drugs  both  presently  and  in  the  future,  with  the  understanding  that  any  drug
violation  will  result  in  the.  automatic  revocation  of  clearance.  (Tr.  25-26;  AE  H)  Post-
hearing, Applicant submitted a negative drug test dated June 30, 2021. (AE L)
Personal Conduct
SOR  ¶   2.a   alleges   that  Applicant   falsified   his  March   31,  2009   SF-86   and
deliberately   failed   to   disclose   his  past   marijuana   use   when   he   answered   “no”  to   the
question  whether he  had  illegally  used  any  controlled  substance  in  the  last  seven  years.
Applicant admitted  this allegation with explanations. (SOR Answer)
Applicant  stated  he  “regretfully”  failed  to  disclose  his  2004  two-time  college
marijuana  use.  He  further explained  when  he  completed  his 2009 SF-86,  he  “deemed
these  2  occasions  as  insignificant  and  not  worthy  of  acknowledgement  since  [he]
thereafter  never  used   marijuana   through   2009.”  He   realizes  now   that   failing   to   list  his
2004   marijuana   use,  regardless  of   how   insignificant  it  may   have   been,  was  not  a
judgment for him  to  make. (SOR Answer)  When  Applicant completed  his 2009  SF-86, it
was his first job  out of college  and   he  “felt like  it was negligible  enough  to  dismiss . . .
per  [his]  judgement  at   the   time.”  This   was  also  the   first  time   he   applied   for  a   security
clearance. (Tr. 31-32, 40-41)
Applicant stated that since 2009, he has matured and grown, and now strives to
be  a  responsible  citizen,  human  being,  brother,  son,  and  coworker.  He  disclosed  his
2004  two-time  marijuana  use  in  the  interest  of  honesty,  peace  of  mind,  and  peace  of
conscience. (Tr. 32-33)
Character Evidence
Applicant  submitted  his  work  performance  reviews  for  2019  and  2020.  Those
reviews  document  sustained  superior  performance  and  rate  him  as  a  “top  performer.”
Management views  him as a  subject matter expert and placed him  in leadership roles
and  positions  of  responsibility.  Applicant  is  a  trusted  employee  within  his  company  as
well  as  with  his  company’s  customer  base.  (Tr.  37-38;  AE  C)  Applicant  informed  his
manager of these proceedings in early 2021 “to give him a heads up to some extent in
the  event  that  [he  was]  denied  a  clearance.”  He  did  so  to  mitigate  the  loss  to  the
company  of  him  being  terminated  as  a  result  of  his  clearance being  denied.  Applicant
stated  that  his manager “certainly  hopes for  a  positive  outcome.”  (Tr. 50-51) When  he
disclosed  his  past  marijuana  use  to  his  manager,  his  manager  could  have  started  the
termination process, but did not do so. (Tr. 55-56)
Applicant  has  received  two  company  awards  for:  (1)  his  leadership  role  in
company  diversity  in  Employee  Resource  Groups;  and  (2)  nomination  for  a  company
president leadership award for his efforts in securing “a major program.” Applicant also
received  various  monetary  awards  in  the  form  of  bonuses  for  his  work-related
accomplishments. (Tr. 38-39; AE D)
Applicant  submitted  two  reference  letters  from:  (1)  former  college  classmate,
coworker,  and  lifelong  friend,  who  has  known  Applicant  for  18  years;  and  (2)  staff
engineer/co-worker, top secret clearance holder, and 35-year company employee, who
has known Applicant 15 years. (Tr. 35-36; AE E) Reference (1) described how he and
Applicant  went  to  the  same  prestigious  university  and  survived  in  a  very  demanding
academic  environment  where  they  threw  “the  kitchen  sink  at  you”  and  how  it  took
everything in oneself “to stay afloat.” Reference (1) discussed how they went to work for
the same defense contractor where he saw Applicant “take ownership and leadership in
re-constructing and  modernizing  fundamental software  critical to  [defense  contractor’s]
design.”  The  writer  noted  Applicant’s  attention  to  detail  and  uncompromising  integrity.
He discussed how Applicant overcame his spinal cord injury and did not let it hinder him
in his work or attitude. (AE E),
Reference  (2)  has  knowledge  of  the  SOR  allegations  against  Applicant.  In  the
last 15 years, he has worked closely with Applicant. Reference (2) knows Applicant well
and   has first-hand   knowledge   of   his work ethic  and   character.  He described   Applicant
as  someone   with   “excellent  judgment”  and   an   employee   “entrusted   with   increasingly
responsible  positions  of leadership.” He  added  that at no  time  has anyone  on  their  team
or in management questioned  Applicant’s ability  to  lead  effectively  and  protect sensitive
information.   Reference   (2)  noted   that   if   Applicant  was  unable  to   perform   his  current
duties,  their   company   would  lose   one   of   their   most  valuable  leaders.  He  added   the
customer would also lose  one  of  the  best subject matter experts in a  highly  critical area.
See  AE E  for further details.
Applicant submitted three photographs depicting him in various settings. The first
one is of him in his wheel chair playing basketball, the second is of him on a hand cycle,
and the third is of him with his extended family. The hand cycle photograph depicts him
as an adaptive sports program member participating in a program fundraiser. Applicant
credits his family with providing him with moral support and the “number one reason” he
is  where  he  is  today.  It  was  his  closeness  with  his  family  that  caused  him  to  relocate
nearer  to  them.  (Tr.  36-37,  58-60;  AE  F)  The  last  two  photographs  are  of  Applicant’s
home that he purchased in October 2020 after saving for many years. (Tr. 37; AE G)
