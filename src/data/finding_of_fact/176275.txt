Applicant is a 64-year-old married man. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1982 and
a master’s degree in 1987. Since 2007, he has been working for a company in the avionics
industry that he co-founded. (Item 3 at 12)
Applicant  failed  to  file  his  federal  tax  returns  from  2009  to  2019,  as  alleged  in
subparagraph 1.a, and he owes a $28,551 delinquency for tax year 2009, as alleged in
subparagraph 1.c. As of March 2021, Applicant had two delinquent consumer accounts,
collectively totaling approximately $10,000, as alleged in subparagraphs 1.d and 1.e.
Applicant attributed his financial problems to the struggles of his business, which he
contends generated minimal income over the years. As his business struggled, he turned
to credit cards to make ends meet. (Item 4 at 7) He attributes his failure to file his income
tax returns to his inability to manage their complexity. (Item 4 at 13) He contends that he is
paying  the  2009  delinquency  through  a  payment  plan  (Item  4  at  11),  but  provided  no
supporting documentation.
Per SOR subparagraph 1.b, Applicant did not file state tax returns for tax years 2009
through 2019. In Applicant’s home state, the only income subject to taxation is that which
derives from dividends and interests from bonds and debt notes. (State X §77.4) Applicant
contends  that  during  the  years  that  he  struggled  financially,  he  did  not  have  enough
investment income, as defined under the state statute, to meet the threshold for filing state
income tax returns.
The consumer debt in subparagraph 1.d totals $3,816. By April 2021, Applicant had
satisfied this debt through monthly payments of $243. (Reply to FORM at 5)
As of February 2022, the balance of the debt set forth in subparagraph 1.e, was
$6,833. (Reply at 1) Applicant contends that he has been satisfying this debt through a
payment plan since November 2020. (Reply at 1) He provided proof of one payment made
in February 2022.
