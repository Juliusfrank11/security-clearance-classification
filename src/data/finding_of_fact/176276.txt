Applicant  is 29 years old  and single.  He has  bachelor’s  degree from the  United
States Merchant Marine Academy. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor
since  February  2020  and  seeks  to  retain  national  security  eligibility  and  a  security
clearance in connection with his employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A,
and 17.)
Applicant was on active duty with the United States Coast Guard from June 2016
to  December  2017,  when  he  resigned  his  commission  due  to  an  injury.  He  was
unemployed  or  underemployed  from  that  time  until  he  began  work  with  his  current
employer.  Applicant  stated  that  his  employment  situation  in  2018  and  2019  is  what
caused his delinquent debt issues. Since becoming employed Applicant has worked to
resolve  all  of  his  past-due  indebtedness.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at  Section  13A  and
Exhibit 2; Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 20-21, 28, 34.)

is
The SOR alleged that Applicant had five charged-off or past-due consumer debts,
and one state tax lien, in the total amount of approximately $40,342. The existence and
amount  of  this  debt  is supported  by  credit  reports  dated  March  24,  2020;  October 20,
2020;  May  18,  2021;  and  January  23,  2022.  They  are  also  supported  by  Applicant’s
answers on his e-QIP, and his statement to an investigator from the Office of Personnel
Management. (Government Exhibits 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7.)
The current status of the debts is as follows:
1.a. Applicant admitted that he owed his state of residence $2,616 in back taxes
and that a tax lien had been filed against him. He paid this tax debt in full and the state
released the lien on February 16, 2021. (Applicant Exhibits C and E; Tr. 21-23.) This debt
has been resolved.
1.b. Applicant admitted that he owed a past-due debt to a cable company in the
amount of $153. Documentation provided by the Government showed that this debt was
paid on or about June 18, 2021. (Government Exhibit 3 and Exhibit 7 at 3; Tr. 23-25.) This
debt is resolved.
1.c.  Applicant  admitted  that he  owed  a  charged-off  debt to  a  bank in  the  amount of
$16,634.  Applicant  made   a   payment  arrangement  with   the   collection   agency   that
purchased  the  debt.  He  resolved  the  debt on  March 6, 2021, as shown  by  documentation
from  the  collection  agency. The  credit  reports in the  record  that appear to  show  Applicant
still  owed  a  debt to  the  original creditor are incorrect since  the  debt was transferred  or
sold  to  the  collection agency. (Government  Exhibit 7;  Applicant Exhibits A  and  H; Tr. 25-
28, 35.)  This debt is resolved.
1.d. Applicant admitted that he owed a charged-off debt to a bank in the amount
of $14,886. Applicant made a payment arrangement with the bank and resolved the debt
in  February  2021.  (Government  Exhibit  7;  Applicant  Exhibit  H; Tr. 29-31.) This debt  is
resolved.
1.e. Applicant admitted that he owed a bank $1,464 for a charged-off debt. He paid
this debt in full on June 21, 2021. (Government Exhibit 7; Applicant Exhibit F; Tr. 31.) This
debt is resolved.
1.f.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  owed  a  bank  $4,589  for  a  charged-off  debt.  He
resolved this debt with the bank and paid the agreed amount in March 2021. (Applicant
Exhibits C and H; Tr. 31-32.) This debt is resolved.
Applicant submitted documentation that showed he resolved an additional credit
card debt that was not alleged in the SOR. (Applicant Exhibit B; Tr. 32-33.)
Applicant’s  current  financial  status  is  stable.  Other than  the  accounts  described
above he has no other delinquent debt. He is approved for a mortgage and is buying a
house.  He  is  able  to  pay  his  current  debts  without  difficulty.  (Government  Exhibit  7;
Applicant Exhibits G and H; Tr. 33-34.)
