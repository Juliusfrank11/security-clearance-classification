In his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (¶¶ 1.a – 1.i). In his
explanation  about  his  debts  and  tax  issues,  he  described  his  financial  and  personal
problems  from  2005  to  2021.  In  this  16-year  time  period,  Applicant  cited  a  variety  of
reasons,  including:  the  housing  and  rental  market  bubbles  and  fluctuations;  job
changes; moves for career opportunities; work demands and time obligations; problems
with  tenants  renting  his  home;  medical  ailments  of  Applicant  and  his  wife;  elder  care
and  health  issues  with  his  mother  and  mother-in-law;  and  wildfires  in  his  home  state.
Applicant’s admissions and explanations are incorporated into the findings of fact. After
a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 65 years old. He has been employed as a senior design engineer by
a defense contractor since 2019. This is his first application for a security clearance. He
graduated high school in 1975, earned an associate’s degree in 1985, and a bachelor’s
degree in 1992. He has been married since 2005, and has two adult step-children. (Item
3)
Applicant has had several periods of unemployment. He was laid off from his job
in 2018, and was out of work for approximately five months. After another layoff in 2012,
he was again unemployed for about two and a half years. During this time, he looked for
work in his field,  and  oversaw the  restoration  of his mother’s home.  He was supported
by  unemployment  compensation  and  his  spouse’s  social  security.  Over  the  last  16
years, Applicant has moved several times for employment within his home state, and he
made one move to another state for about ten months in 2015. (Items 2, 3, 7)
Applicant  provided   several  explanations   about   why   he   did   not   file   or   pay   his
federal  or  state   taxes.  He  stated   that  an   out-of-state   move,  a  tight  and   expensive
housing  market,  his mother’s health, and  personal expenses in 2016  were reasons he
could not  hire  an accountant  to  complete his 2015  taxes. He  reported  that  his  mother-in-
law’s declining   health,   a  demanding   job, and   household   moves were reasons he   could
not  hire  an  accountant  to  complete  his  2016  taxes.  He  stated  that  household  moves, a
demanding  job,  his mother-in-law’s declining   health,   a  health  issue  in November 2017,
his wife’s medical issues and  appointments,  and the  complexity  of itemized  deductions
were reasons that he  could  not  complete  his 2017  taxes. He reported  that taking  care of
his  mother-in-law,  his  health   issues,  his  wife’s  health   issues,  his  failure  to   file   or  pay
taxes for 2015  –  2017,  and  the  complexity  of  itemized  deductions were reasons that he
could  not  complete   his  2018   taxes.  He  asserted   that  federal  and   state   taxes  were
withheld from  his pay check from  2015  –  2018. (Item 3, 7)
In 2020, Applicant stated that because he gave so much of his time, effort, and
expertise  to  his  employer,  it  had  prevented  him  from  filing  his  taxes  on  time.  He  said
that  unless  his  employer  provided  him  with  an  extended  paid  leave  to  focus  solely  on
getting his taxes completed, he will only be able to work on them when he has free time,
and is not busy with his other personal responsibilities. (Item 4)
Applicant’s  IRS  tax  records  show  that  as  of  March  2020,  his  2015,  2016,  and
2018  federal  income  tax  returns  had  not  been  filed.  His  2017  return  was  filed  in
November of 2019, which was more than  a year late. The records show that he made
payments  to  the  IRS  from  2016  to  2019  in  varying  amounts.  No  documentation  was
provided  to  show  that  these  were  voluntary  payments,  not  garnishments.  Applicant
reported that he had previously owed taxes to the IRS, and around 2012 had a plan in
place to pay $100 monthly. He was uncertain about the status of this payment plan or
the amount that had been paid. (Item 4, 7)
The  record  includes  a  proposed  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS  dated
December  8,  2021.  Applicant  contacted  the  IRS  on  November  29,  2021,  and  the  IRS
proposed a repayment plan of $250 monthly payments beginning in January 2022. The
IRS  had  not  yet  calculated  the  full  amount  that  he  owed.  No  documentation  was
provided  to  show  that  he  has  made  any  payments  on  this  agreement  or  the  amounts
owed. (AE B)
Applicant’s most recent  state tax records show that  he had delinquent  state tax
debt  for  2015,  2016,  and  2018.  Between  April  2019  to  August  2020,  he  paid  $200
monthly  toward  this  debt.  No  documentation  was  provided  to  show  if  these  were
voluntary  payments  or  garnishments.  The  records  also  show  that  he  had  a  $227  tax
debt for 2020, which was paid in November 2021. (Item 4; AE C – J)
Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2013. He had $493,281 of debt
discharged without payment in June 2013. (SOR ¶ 1.a) In his Answer, he states that he
had  to  file  bankruptcy  because  of  financial  and  personal  problems  starting  in  2005,
including: purchasing a home in a speculative housing market; moves for employment;
problems  with  renting  his  home;  a  failed  start-up  business;  loss  of  employment;  an
expensive  home  rental  market;  the  cost  of  health  insurance;  and  medical  problems  of
him and his wife. (Item 2, 5)
In addition to the bankruptcy, the SOR alleged that Applicant had unfiled Federal
and state income tax returns for tax years 2015-2018 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.i). He also had an
outstanding $3,334 federal tax debt for 2009 (SOR ¶ 1.a) as well as a state tax debt of
$3,094  for  2015,  which  was  repaid  through  garnishment  in  2020  (SOR  ¶  1.f),  and  a
2016 state tax debt of $2,642 (SOR ¶ 1.g).
Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  He  provided  no  documentation
about  his  2009  unpaid  tax  debt.  He  failed  to  provide  documentation  showing  that  his
outstanding state and Federal tax returns have been filed, even belatedly. His state tax
records show that he still owes $301 for 2016, a debt which remains unpaid. (AE D)
Applicant  did  not  submit  any  documentation  concerning  his  current  financial
situation, such as his monthly income and expenses, his assets, or whether he follows a
budget. He has not asserted that his tax filings since 2018 have been timely.  Applicant
received  credit  counseling  as  part  of  his  2013  bankruptcy,  but  provided  no
documentation of any subsequent counseling.
