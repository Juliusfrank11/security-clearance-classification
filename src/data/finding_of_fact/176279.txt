Applicant is a 56-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for
her current employer since December 2019. She is applying for a security clearance for
the first time. She is a high school graduate. She married in 1987 and divorced in 2000.
Her two children are 34 and 26 years old. (Tr. at 16-19, 35; GE 1, 3)
Applicant  was  unsophisticated  about  legal  matters  when  she  went  through  her
divorce,  and  she  signed  documents  that  she  did  not  really  understand.  She  did  not
realize  that  she  agreed  that  her  ex-husband  would  have  custody  of  the  children,  and
she  would  be  liable for  child  support.  She  was  ordered  to  pay  about  $300  per month.

Applicant  lost  a  job  in  2010.  She  had  health  issues,  and  went  through  years  of
unemployment and underemployment. She contacted the department that handled her
child  support  payments,  and  she  paid  $10  per  month,  which  led  to  a  large  amount  of
arrearages. A March 2020 credit report listed the balance as $52,751. (Tr. at 25-26; GE
1-3)
Applicant’s paychecks from her current employer were garnished about $70 per
week  starting  in  2020.  The  payments  were  going  to  her  ex-husband  to  pay  the
arrearages,  even  though  her  children  had  reached  majority  years  earlier.  She  was
garnished $2,761 in 2020; $3,904 in 2021; and $782 in 2022. (Tr. at 16-17, 24-25; AE

Applicant’s ex-husband passed away in September 2021. Her children petitioned
the  court  to  end  the  child  support  payments.  The  court  closed  the  case  on  March  28,
2022,  with  the  annotation:  “All  child  support  amounts  established  by  the  court  or
administrative order, [redacted], including past due support have been collected and the
obligation has ended.” Applicant’s finances are otherwise in order. (Tr. at 15-16, 31-34;
AE A-D, F)
Applicant submitted letters attesting to her excellent job performance and strong
moral character. She is praised for her trustworthiness, work ethic, and judgment. (AE
