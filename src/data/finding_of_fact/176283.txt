Applicant   is   a   66-year-old  employee   of  a   defense   contractor,   where  he   has
worked   since   2002.   He  worked   for  another  defense   contractor   for  almost   20   years
before  his  current job.   He served  on  active  duty  in the  U.S. military  from  1975  until  he
was  honorably   discharged   in  1978.  He   seeks  to   retain   a   security   clearance,  which  he
has held for about  40  years. He  has  a  bachelor’s degree  that he earned in  1991. He has
never married, but he  has a  long-time  girlfriend. He  has no  children.  (Tr.  at  11-13,  16-
20; Applicant’s response to  SOR; GE  1)
Applicant  started  playing  the  slot  machines  at  a  local  casino  in  about  1998.  In
about  2009,  his  gambling  started  to  become  a  problem.  (Tr.  at  23,  37-51;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1-4) He reported himself to his security office in June 2010, who
reported the information to the DOD as follows:
Today,  6/24/10,   [Applicant]   self  reported   a   gambling   problem.   He  has
sought  treatment   through   Gamblers Anonymous.  [Applicant]   attended   his
first meeting  on  6/23/10. His gambling  began  a  year ago  and  has resulted
in going  from no  debt to  approximately  $100,000  debt  in the  form  of credit
card, home  equity  and 401k loans. [Applicant]  believes that by  recognizing
his  problem   and   starting   treatment  he   is  not  an   adverse  threat  to   his
country o  r company. He also believes he  can retire his debt in 5  years and
be debt  free  again.  (GE 4)
Applicant  stopped  gambling  for  a  period,  and  then  resumed.  He  went  through
several  periods  of  not  gambling,  followed  by  gambling.  His  gambling  became
problematic again  in about 2018.  He  lost about $200,000 in 2018. He  took out money
from his 401(k) retirement account and  credit cards. He was unable to pay his federal
income  taxes  and  other  debts.  (Tr.  at  42-44,  48-51,  55;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR;
GE 1-3, 5-8)
The SOR alleges Applicant’s gambling issues (SOR ¶¶ 1.e - 1.g); $14,132 owed
to the IRS for tax year 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.a); and three delinquent consumer debts totaling
about $49,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b - 1.d).
Applicant  attributed  his  gambling  problems  to  a  medical  condition  that  requires
medication. One of the side effects of the medication is compulsive behavior. He stated
that he is still on the medication, but his doctor prescribed another medication  in about
2019, which controls the compulsive behavior. (Tr. at 23-26, 59; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 1-3)
Applicant reported his gambling issues on the Questionnaire for National Security
Positions  (SF-86)  he  submitted  in  April  2020.  He  indicated  that  after  two  years  of  not
gambling from about 2016  to early  2018, he  stopped  his counseling;  the  symptoms  of
his  condition  became  aggravated;  and  he  increased  the  medication  that  causes
compulsive behavior. He relapsed from February to November 2018.
Applicant  returned  to  counseling,  and  the  changes  in  his  medication  helped
control his gambling. He attended Gamblers Anonymous meetings. He reported on the
SF  86  that  he  had  not  gambled  since  2018,  and  noted:  “I  believe  I  have  found  the
correct treatment plan for my condition. With this treatment plan I am not gambling nor
feel the urge to gamble and am recovering from my financial situation.”  Applicant wrote
in  his  response  to  the  SOR:  “had  I  found  this  treatment  plan  10  years  earlier  I  am
convinced I would have saved $300,000.” (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1)
Applicant  started  repaying  his  debts  in  2019.  He  paid  or  settled  several  debts
before the SOR was issued, and he made monthly payments to the SOR creditors. He
entered  into  an  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS  in  2020.  (Tr.  at  27;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 3, 5-8; AE A-F)
Applicant refinanced  the  mortgage  on  his home, where he  has lived  since  1986,
and  he  was able  to  pay  or settle  all  of his  debts.  He  paid the  IRS  $11,594  in July  2021
to  completely  pay  his  back taxes. He  paid $14,711  and  $12,155  in  July  2021  to  pay  the
remaining   amounts   owed   on   the   debts  alleged   in   SOR  ¶¶   1.b   and   1.c.  He   settled   the
debt  alleged  in SOR ¶ 1.d  for $7,560  through  11  monthly  payments of  $630, which he
completed  in  February  2021.  (Tr.  at 27-31, 56; Applicant’s response  to  SOR; GE  1,3,  5-
8; AE  A-E)
Applicant’s  finances  are  currently   stable.   He   earns   a   good   salary;  he   received
financial  counseling; he  maintains a  budget;  and  he  is paying  his bills.  He still  has  about
$100,000  in  equity  in his home, and  he  is  rebuilding  his  retirement  account.  (Tr. at 31-
34, 57; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5-8; AE F-K)
Applicant  testified  that  he  is  still  on  the  medication  that  “totally  eliminated”  the
compulsive  behavior  associated  with  the  medication  prescribed  for  his  condition.  He
attends  counseling  and  Gamblers  Anonymous.  He  now  feels  “100  percent”  in  control.
He estimates that he currently goes to the casino and gambles about once a month. He
last  gambled  in  a  casino  about  two  weeks  before  the  hearing,  when  he  “probably lost
$500.” (Tr. at 24-26, 36, 44-55)
Applicant  submitted  documents  and  letters  attesting  to  his  excellent  job
performance. He is considered a valued and trusted employee. (AE L-T)
