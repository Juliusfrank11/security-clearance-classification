Guideline K - Handling Protected Information
The allegations will be discussed in chronological order:
1.a. Applicant admits that in 2007, about 15 years ago, he made a copy and sent
a  document  that  contained  secret  and/or  sensitive  information  which,  prohibits  it  from
being copied and distributed. (TR-2 at page 12 line 3 to page 13 line 20, and GX 5 at
page 6.)
1.b.  Applicant  admits  that  also  in  2007,  he  emailed  a  document  to  a  co-worker
that contained sensitive information. (TR-2 at page 13 line 21 to page 15 line 6, and GX
5 at page 6.)
1.c. Applicant admits that in September of 2011, about 11 years ago, he failed a
weekly audit of his DoD classified computer. (TR-2 at page 15 line 7 to page 16 line 9,
and GX 5 at page 6.)
1.e.  Applicant  denies  that  in  March  of  2015,  about  seven  years  ago,  he  sent
classified  confidential  information  over  an  unclassified  network.  He  avers  that  he  sent
“raw data” that was unclassified. It was later determined that the data, taken as a whole,
was classified. (TR at page 38 line 4 to page 42 line 21, TR-2 at page 23 line 3 to page
27 line 2, and GX 6 at page 4.) Applicant subsequently received hands-on training as a
result of this incident. (AppXs A and B at page 1.)
1.d.  Applicant  denies  that  in  March  of  2016,  about  six  years  ago,  that  he  sent
classified  information over  an  unclassified  network.  He  avers  that  the  data  in  question
was sent to him. (TR at page 22 line 21 to page 37 line 21, TR-2 at page 16 line 10 to
page 23 line 2, and at page 31 line 19 to page 33 line 24.) However, he was found to be
culpable, and received subsequent training from his employer. (GXs 3~5, and AppXs A
and B at page 2.)
