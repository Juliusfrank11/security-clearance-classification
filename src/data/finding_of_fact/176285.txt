The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file federal (SOR ¶ 1.a) and state
(SOR ¶ 1.b) income tax returns for at least tax years 2017 through 2019. When Applicant
answered the SOR, he admitted he had not yet filed his delinquent income tax returns. He
explained that he had time constraints because of care for his elderly mother, and he had
misplaced the tax paperwork needed to file his delinquent returns. He expressed a plan to
submit his unfiled tax returns by June 30, 2021.
Applicant’s admissions to not filing his income tax returns for tax years 2017 through
2019 are accepted and incorporated as factual findings. After considering the pleadings,
exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 57-year-old electrical engineer, who earned his bachelor’s degree in
May 1987. (GE 1; Tr. 25.) From June 1988 to 2000, he worked for a defense contractor.
He was granted a secret clearance for his duties with that employer in 1989. At some time
during his tenure at that company, he worked on special access programs. (Tr. 27.) In
October  2004,  he  began  working  for  his  current  employer,  a  laboratory that  has  DOD
contracts. He has held a DOD secret clearance for his duties with the laboratory since
September 2005. (GE 1; Tr. 26.)
Applicant was married from October 1992 to June 1997. He has no children. (GE 1;
Tr. 23.) He has one brother, who is now 60 years old. (GE 1.)
To renew his clearance eligibility, Applicant completed and certified as accurate a
Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  on  September  30,  2020.  He
disclosed in response to a tax-filing inquiry that he had failed to file a return for tax years
2017, 2018, and 2019. He indicated that he owed no taxes for any of those tax years and
explained that he got behind in filing for tax year 2017 and had to file a return for tax year
2017 before filing his returns for tax years 2018 and 2019. (GE 1.)
On October 21, 2020, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He acknowledged that he had not filed his
federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2017, 2018, and 2019, in part due to
procrastination, but also because he had misplaced or lost documents and had issues with
his personal computer. He asserted that he typically was refunded about $1,000 to $2,000
in federal taxes, so he was certain he owed no federal income taxes for those tax years.
He stated that he often underpaid his state income taxes by about $100 to $200 and had
remitted taxes owed to the state with his returns that he had filed on time in the past. He
expressed an intention to file his delinquent tax returns by the end of 2020. He indicated
that he can afford to meet his financial obligations and expressed a willingness and ability
to pay his debts. He added that he planned on filing his income tax returns on time in the
future. (GE 2.)
As of late March 2021, Applicant had not filed federal or state income tax returns for
tax years 2017, 2018, and 2019. He “let slip the deadline” for filing his returns for tax year
2017,  and  in  preparing  to  complete  his  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2017  and  2018,  he
misplaced some of his tax-related papers, causing more delay leading into the 2019 tax
year. He also explained that he had some “time constraints” in that he had been spending
much of his free time caring for his then 95-year-old mother with dementia and behavioral
issues. He averaged about three hours per day helping her in the evenings and more time
on the weekends. About resolving his tax issues, he stated in response to the SOR:
To  initiate  a  remedy  for  this  delinquency,  I  have  spent  the  past  3  weeks
collecting all tax related documentation [for] the tax years 2017, 2018, and
2019. I plan to update tax forms, to the best of my ability, before meeting
with a tax accountant. As we are in the last weeks of [the] 2020 tax filing
season, getting an appointment with an accountant will be delayed until after
May 17, 2021. My plan is to have all prior years’  tax  forms submitted  to  the
IRS by June 30, 2021, as well as the 2020 tax forms.  (Answer.)
At his hearing, Applicant explained that his brother, who had his own apartment in
their mother’s basement, kept an eye on their mother, who had developed dementia by
age 92. (Tr. 20.) Their mother had caregivers around the clock, but it was up to Applicant to
arrange  for  the  in-home  care  providers  for  his  mother;  manage  her  medications  and
medical appointments; and assist her at bedtime. (Tr. 24-25.)
Applicant was aware of his legal obligation to file income tax returns, but he “just
pushed it aside.” (Tr. 21.) As one year and then the next passed, he had two and then
three years of returns to prepare when the care for his mother became more cumbersome.
(Tr. 21.)  Her health deteriorated from February 2021 until her death in October 2021. She
was hospitalized on four separate occasions during that time span for at least a week each
time. (Tr. 21.) The issues with his mother were “all-consuming.” (Tr. 36.) Even so, he had
some spare time to prepare his income tax returns, but he was not as organized with his
tax paperwork as he would have liked, so did not get his returns done. (Tr. 32.) When he
received the SOR in March 2021, he “did one sweep” for the documentation needed to file
his tax returns, but then put his tax matters on hold because of his mother’s hospitalization.
(Tr. 38.) He received a notice from the IRS in 2021 about his obligation to file a tax return
for tax year 2018. (Tr. 40-41.) It did not prompt him to file his delinquent tax returns. It
occurred  to  him  to  retain  the  services  of  a  tax  preparer,  but  the  issue  became  “the
organization of all the information the accountant needed” to file his returns. (Tr. 36.)
Applicant had always prepared his income tax returns himself, using commercially-
purchased  tax  software.  (Tr. 31.) He  could  afford  to  pay a  professional to  prepare  his
income tax returns. His current annual salary exceeds $150,000. (Tr. 36.)
Applicant  filed  for an  extension  of  the  filing  deadline for his income  tax returns for
tax  year 2020. He sent in $500  each  to  the  IRS  and  state  with  his request for an  extension
for 2020  in case  he  underpaid his income  taxes. (Tr. 42.) The  October 2021  extended
deadline  for filing  passed  without him  filing  returns for tax  year 2020. (Tr. 35.) He testified
that the  two  and  then  three  months following  his mother’s death  “flew  by  like  it  was  nothing.
It  was just  kind  of  in a  daze.” (Tr. 22.)  He explained  that he  also had  an  issue  with  an
apartment.  On  the  death  of  his father in 2005, Applicant inherited  a  1/8th  interest  in a  six-
unit apartment building  that was sold in 2020. (Tr. 30-33.)  He believes the  accountant
handling  the  estate  filed  an  erroneous “K1  1065  Form” on  the  apartment for tax  year 2020,
which he  brought to  the  accountant’s attention  sometime  in  spring  2021.  He  was  waiting  for
the accountant to file the correct form. (Tr. 33-34.)
In  late  January  2022,  Applicant  began  looking  for  his  tax  documents  to  file  his
delinquent tax returns. (Tr. 38.) Over the month immediately preceding his March 2022
security clearance hearing, Applicant went through four to five boxes of documents and
some mail for his tax paperwork. In the process, he discovered that he had no record of
having filed his federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2016, in addition to tax
years 2017 through 2020. (Tr. 22, 28.) He prepared his delinquent income tax returns
within  a  week  or  so  preceding  his  security  clearance  hearing.  (AEs  B-F;  Tr.  29.)  The
accountant handling the apartment agreed to meet with Applicant sometime after this tax
season  to  review  the  returns  Applicant  prepared  using  tax  software.  (Tr.  30.)  The  tax
returns  prepared  by  Applicant  in  March  2022  show  the  following  with  respect  to  his
adjusted  gross  income  and  claimed  tax  refunds  or  underpayments  for  tax  years  2016
through 2020:

Applicant testified that he has “no real excuse” for not catching up on his income tax
returns. (Tr. 37.) As of the close of the record, Applicant had not filed his recently-prepared
federal or state income tax returns for tax years 2016 through 2020. (AE A; Tr. 33.) IRS tax
account transcripts show that, as of April 15, 2022, the IRS had no record of returns from
Applicant  for  tax  years  2016  through  2020.  The  IRS  issued  notices  to  him  about  his
missing tax return on July 16, 2018 for tax year 2016; December 3, 2018 for tax year 2017;
March 30, 2020 for tax year 2018; and March 8, 2021 for tax year 2019. The IRS received
a payment of $500 from Applicant for tax year 2020 on May 17, 2021. He was granted an
extension to October 15, 2021, for his 2020 tax return but has not filed a return as of April
15, 2022. (AE A.)
