The  amended  SOR alleges that Applicant failed  to  timely  file  state  (state  X) (SOR ¶
1.a) income  tax  returns for tax  years 2015  through  2019; federal income  tax  returns for tax
years 2015  through  2020  (SOR ¶  1.b); and  state  (state  Y)  income  tax  returns for tax  years
2019  and  2020  (SOR ¶  1.c). Applicant  has admitted  the  failure to  file  the  tax  returns by  the
tax  deadlines. His admission  to  failing  to  timely  file  his income  tax  returns when  they  were
due  for tax  years 2015  through  2020  is incorporated  as a  finding  of  fact.  After considering
the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript,  I  make the following additional  findings of fact:
Applicant is a 70-year-old subject matter expert in a defense technology. (GE 1; AE
A.) He has a bachelor’s degree earned in May 1973, a master’s degree earned in June
1976, and a doctorate degree earned in August 1978. Applicant and his spouse wed in
September  1985.  They  have  three  grown  children  ages  30,  32,  and  35,  who  are  not
dependent on them. (GE 1; Tr. 28.)
Applicant  has  spent  his  career  in  the  defense  industry  and  has  worked  for  his
current  defense-contractor  employer  since  July  2019.  He  was  first  granted  a  security
clearance in 1989 or 1990. (GE 1; AE A; Tr. 65.)
Applicant and  his spouse  began  caring  for his elderly  aunt in 2012. His aunt  resided
in another state, but Applicant was responsible  for finding  caregivers for his aunt.  (Tr. 32-
33, 60.) He was in charge of his aunt’s finances and was her healthcare proxy. (Tr. 29.)
In September 2014, Applicant resigned from employment of almost nine years with
a laboratory in state Y that contracts with the DOD. He disagreed with management on how
to best serve a customer, and his performance was deemed unsatisfactory. Applicant was
unemployed  from  September  2014  to  July  2015.  (GE  1;  Tr.  59.)  He  collected
unemployment benefits from state Y, and his spouse was employed outside the home as a
teacher until she retired in 2016. (Tr. 30.) They reside in  a state that  does not tax the
income of its residents. State Y taxed his income at the laboratory as a non-resident wage-
earner. (Tr. 79-80.)
In  July  2015,  Applicant  relocated  across  the  country  to  state  X  for  work  with  a
previous employer as a contractor on a DOD program. (Tr. 60.) He rented a room in a
house while his spouse and children stayed behind in their home. (GE 1.)
In September 2016, Applicant and his spouse purchased a condominium in state X,
to save on rent while he was working there. (Tr. 40.) Applicant’s spouse stayed behind to
care for his elderly aunt, who had some major medical issues. (Tr. 25-26.) In November
2016, Applicant and his spouse moved his aunt from her state of residence because she
was not receiving the care she needed in her state. (Tr. 33-34, 61.) Applicant’s spouse
cared for his aunt in their home for about one week before moving his aunt into an assisted
living facility near her. In early 2017, Applicant’s spouse moved his aunt into another facility
where she was provided more appropriate care. The burden of maintaining, clearing out,
and then selling his aunt’s house in another state fell on Applicant and his spouse. (Tr. 34.)
In January 2018, Applicant’s spouse had a medical issue for which she was hospitalized
for a few days. (Tr. 26, 38.) Applicant traveled back home from state X to help her. (Tr. 26.)
In April 2018, his aunt’s house sold. (Tr. 34.) In June 2018, his aunt was hospitalized for
over a  week, and  Applicant’s spouse  had  to  deal with  palliative  care and  hospice care
providers for his aunt. Applicant’s spouse spent on average two to three hours per day with
his aunt from 2017 until July 2019, when she died. (Tr. 35-36.)
Applicant handled their taxes in that he gathered the information needed to file their
tax returns for their certified public accountant (CPA), who had been preparing their tax
returns  since  around  2012.  Some  documents  needed  to  file  their  tax  returns  went  to
Applicant in state X and other documents went to their marital residence. (Tr. 30-31.) It
became  an  issue  getting the  documentation  to  their CPA  in  a  timely fashion.  (Tr. 31.)
Applicant came home approximately one weekend per month. On some of the trips, when
he had time available, he would look through some of his paperwork, but it was “a real
challenge.” (Tr. 37, 69.)  He filed their tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016  late. He
recalls  it  was  in  either  2018  or  2019.  (Tr.  70.)  He  indicated  on  a  June  19,  2020
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that he filed his income tax returns
and  paid  his  taxes  late  for  tax  years  2015  and  2016,  but  the  issues  were  resolved  in
November 2018. However, he also indicated that he made a tax payment of $4,339 to the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) around November 19, 2019. (GE 1.) The tax deadline for
filing his and his spouse’s joint income tax returns for 2017 passed without them filing their
federal or state X income tax returns. (Tr. 39.)
Initially, Applicant worked full time in state X, but after several budget cuts, his hours
were reduced to four days a week. After a significant reduction in program funding in 2019,
he  was  laid  off  in  April  2019.  He  received  a  severance  package  and  collected
unemployment compensation. The  tax  deadline  for filing  his and  his spouse’s joint tax
returns for 2018 passed without their federal and state X income tax returns being filed.
(Tr. 39.) In June 2019, Applicant moved back home. He began working for his current
employer on a U.S. military installation in state Y in July 2019. (GE 1.) His first priority was
his job (Tr. 71), and he did not file a tax return with the IRS or with states X and Y for tax
year 2019 by the tax deadlines for those returns. (Tr. 32.) A trip planned for March 2020 to
sell their condominium in state X was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. (Tr.
40.)  At  the  start  of  the  pandemic,  they  apologized  to  their  CPA  for  not  getting  tax
documents to her that they needed to file their tax returns, although the CPA largely left it
to them to contact her. (Tr. 43-44.) Applicant did not think of submitting the documentation
he had at the time to the CPA as he wanted to have all the information needed for his
returns before contacting the CPA. (Tr. 73.)
On his June 2020 SF 86, Applicant stated  that he and his spouse were “late” in
submitting their federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018 because
of him commuting between his home and state X on a monthly basis to see his spouse and
help  her care  for his ailing aunt  in  an  assisted  living facility.  Also,  he  had  not kept his
paperwork and computer files organized nor allocated the time. He added that he was
working with a tax preparer to get his taxes filed for tax years 2017, 2018, and 2019, but
that taxes were withheld from his income. He disclosed that he had filed his returns and
paid his taxes late for tax years 2015 and 2016, and he received refunds of $4,176 in
federal income taxes and $3,784 from state X for tax year 2015. For 2016, he paid $4,339
to the IRS “shortly after 19 Nov. 2019,” and he received a $4,648 refund from state X. He
did not know what he owed, if anything, to the IRS or state X for tax years 2017 and 2018.
(GE 1.)
Applicant was interviewed by telephone by an authorized investigator for the Office
of Personnel Management (OPM) on August 5, 2020. Applicant admitted that he had not
yet filed his federal or state X income tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018. He added
that he would contact the IRS within the next few days to resolve the matters and pay any
taxes owed. He explained that he had not filed his returns or paid his taxes on time due to
a family member’s ill heath and having caregiver duties for this person. He also stated that
he was not able to attend to these financial matters while living in state X away from his
wife. (GE 2.)
At  the  request  of  the  DCSA  CAF,  Applicant  on February 8, 2021, provided IRS
account transcripts for 2017 and 2018 and state X wage and withholding information for tax
years 2015 through 2019. The IRS account transcript for 2017 showed that, as of January
5,  2021,  no  return  had  been  filed.  The  IRS  had  inquired  about  his  missing  return  on
November  15,  2018,  and  issued  a  notice  on  December  3,  2018.  Wage  and  income
information received by the IRS for tax year 2017 reflected wage income of $144,495 and
retirement benefits paid to him of $3,528. The account transcript for 2018 likewise showed
no return had been filed by January 5, 2021. He had a filing extension to October 15, 2019.
When the deadline passed with no return being filed, the IRS made an inquiry on March
10, 2020, and issued a notice on March 30, 2020.  Reported wage income was $125,542,
and retirement income was $10,788. He also received a gross distribution of $9,000 from
retirement accounts. State X wages and withholding details showed he had income taxes
withheld each year from his income, but not whether his and his spouse’s joint returns had
been filed. (GE 2.) Recently prepared and filed state X tax return for 2017 shows that they
were refunded $4,648 in state X taxes for 2016. (AE C.)
In a detailed response of February 8, 2021, to DCSA CAF interrogatories, Applicant
expressed  deep  regret  for  not  filing  his  tax  returns  on  time  and  for  failing  to  request
extensions of the tax-filing deadlines. He cited primarily three circumstances since 2012 or
2013, which “depleted the time [he and his spouse] could have spent keeping [their] lives,
[their]  files  of  paperwork  and  [their]  house  much  less  cluttered  and  better  organized.”
Chiefly, he blamed “all the time, worry, and effort” involved in caring for his ailing aunt, his
acceptance of a position in state X, and the consequent “degradation” in their ability to
keep their paperwork and home organized. He and his spouse had to interview potential
caretakers for 24-hour care for his aunt in her home, arrange for her financial affairs, and
meet with her attorneys. When her health deteriorated to where she could no longer be
cared for safely in her home, they moved his aunt into an assisted living facility in state Y in
2016. However, after only a short time there, they had to move her to another facility that
could better care for her. He added that much of the responsibility for his aunt’s medical
(finding doctors, arranging for transportation to medical visits and procuring prescriptions)
and legal needs (updating his aunt’s will, revising her trust, handling her finances) fell to his
spouse, until his spouse was hospitalized. After his aunt died in early July 2019, Applicant
served as executor of her will and trust. (GE 3.)
Concerning his job search’s impact, Applicant explained that he had no success
from mid-2014 to mid-2015 because of a tight job market. He accepted a position in state X
around July 2015 because the work was challenging and he respected his co-workers from
prior interactions with them, knowing that it would strain his and his spouse’s ability to
remain organized. He cited his commute back home every three or four weeks, and the
time-consuming purchase of a condominium after one year of paying rent. He was able to
get caught up on his returns and tax payments for 2015 and 2016 but then had to look for
another position when funding decreased for the program he was working on. Only a few
months after his layoff in April 2019, he was able to secure his present employment, but he
had to ship his belongings back home. He stated that with the assistance of a professional
tax preparer, he would file his 2017 and 2018 tax returns and then complete the filing of his
2019 and 2020 tax returns by the end of 2021. (GE 3.)
In  August  2021,  Applicant  and  his spouse  traveled  to  state  X to  clean  out  their
condominium and list it for sale. (Tr. 40.) The condominium sold in October 2021. (Tr. 63.)
At the time, Applicant took possession of some documents that were in the condominium
(W-2 forms and “charitable stuff”) that he needed to file their delinquent income tax returns
(Tr. 41-42), although neither he nor his spouse elaborated as to the which tax years the
documents  pertained.  They  rented  a  storage  shed  near  their  home  to  store  boxes  of
documents after they had sorted through them. It gave them space to get their taxes and
other important paperwork organized. (Tr. 63.)
Starting in January 2022, Applicant began a concerted effort, in piecemeal fashion,
to  compile  and  give  their  CPA  the  documents  needed  to  file  his  and  his  spouse’s
delinquent federal, state X, and state Y tax returns. (Tr. 43.) On March 2, 2022, the CPA
finished preparing, and Applicant submitted his and his spouse’s joint federal income tax
returns for tax years 2017 through 2020 and their state X income tax returns for tax years
2017 through 2019. (AEs C-F.) On March 24, 2022, the CPA finished preparing Applicant’s
and his spouse’s joint state Y income tax return for tax year 2019. On March 25, 2022, the
CPA finished their state Y income tax return for tax year 2020, and Applicant mailed the tax
returns for 2019 and 2020 to state Y. (AEs E-F.) Applicant paid the taxes owed when they
submitted their tax returns. He filed for an extension of the tax-filing deadline for tax year
2021. (AE B.)
The tax returns for tax years 2017 through 2020 reflect the following with respect to
their adjusted gross incomes and tax refunds or underpayments:

Applicant  understands,  in  hindsight,  that  he  could  have  taken  steps  to  better
coordinate their finances, such as purchasing a laptop that would allow for the use of Excel
software. (Tr. 12.) He also learned over the last year that the IRS had a lot of their tax
information that he could have accessed to get their delinquent tax returns filed. (Tr. 62,
68.) He was aware from completing security clearance applications in the past that not
filing tax returns could be of concern to the DOD. (Tr. 66.) As to why he did not make filing
the delinquent tax returns a priority, Applicant stated:
Again,   my,  first  of   all,  our  marriage.,   our  health,  finding   and   having
employment and  contributing  were the  primary  things in my  life. I didn’t want
to   be   collecting   unemployment  insurance   and   a   tax   burden.  That,   those
focus my efforts on getting, getting a  position. With  going  out to  [state  X],  it
was just  very  stressful. I was on  my  mind  but yes, there were many  other
things also on  my  mind. And  it wasn’t at the  bottom  of  the  list,  but it fell  below
what it, what I felt I was able to do without overstressing myself  or my  wife.
(Tr. 67.)
Applicant and his spouse always intended to pay the taxes owed. He made sure that
their bills were paid, including on the condominium in state X, but the burden of gathering
the information needed to file their tax returns was “another level of difficulty up from that.”
(Tr. 67-68.)
As of July 2020, Applicant’s gross salary was $137,508 annually. (GE  2.) He works
on a contract that provides engineering support to the United States Air Force. He highly
values the technical work that he does for the U.S. government and does not want to lose
the opportunity to “do more good for the U.S. government.” (AE A.) He is remorseful and
embarrassed about his failure to file his tax returns on time. (Tr. 73-74.)
The chief engineer to whom Applicant reported from about July 2019 until February
2021 indicated that Applicant’s performance in 2019 “demonstrably led” to the project team
receiving  a  prestigious  small  team  of  the  year  award.  The  chief  engineer  assessed
Applicant  as  an  exceptional  performer.  He  considered  Applicant  “an  outstanding
engineering  professional  with  exceptional  experience  from  an  abundance  of  technical
perspectives and [as someone who] is an essential engineer to keep [their] project cost,
schedule, and performance on track.” (AE A.)
The section lead on the project, who has been working with Applicant for a little over
a year, testified that he brought Applicant to the project because of Applicant’s “inordinate
amount of experience in the application of engineering into government-related projects.
They work remotely, and maintain almost daily contact through video conferencing, texting,
or emails. (Tr. 52.) The section lead considers Applicant to be “trustworthy without any
questions  whatsoever.”  (Tr.  54.)  He  is  aware  that  the  issue  about  Applicant’s  security
worthiness involves “unpaid back taxes compiled,” but that Applicant is completing them.
He has not seen any actions by Applicant that causes him any concerns. The section lead
had a similar issue involving unpaid taxes “due to an accountant’s error” about 15 years
ago. (Tr. 55-56.)
