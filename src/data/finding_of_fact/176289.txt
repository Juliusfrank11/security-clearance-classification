Applicant  is  a   53-year-old  manager,  systems  engineering   II,  who   has  been
employed   by   a   defense   contractor   since   May   2015.  He   has   held   a   secret   clearance
since   2009,  which  he   obtained   when   employed   by   a   previous  defense   contractor.   He
seeks to  upgrade  his clearance from  Secret  to  Top  Secret  as a  job  requirement.  (Tr. 12-
14; GE 1, GE 2)
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  1987.  He  was  awarded  a  bachelor  of
arts  degree  in  health,  physical  education,  and  recreation  in  1992,  and  he  received  a
single subject teaching credential in 1998. Applicant was awarded a master’s degree in
family and child counseling in 2000. (Tr. 14-18; GE 1, GE 2)
Applicant married in 2001, and has three children all living  at home. His spouse
at present does not work outside the home. His oldest daughter, age 21, finished high
school and  does “some  driving  and  some  babysitting.”  His two younger sons, ages 19
and 13, are still in school. (Tr. 18-20; GE 1)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s SOR lists five allegations, all related to his failure to file Federal and
state  income  tax  returns  and  indebtedness  to  the  Federal  Government  for  back  taxes
owed.  The  allegations  are  established  by  his  May  26,  2017  SF-86;  his  Office  of
Personnel  Management  Personal  Subject  Interview  (OPM  PSI);  his  January  20,  2021
Response to DOHA Interrogatories; and his June 7, 2021 SOR Answer. (GE 1 through
3; SOR Answer; Tr. 23)
Applicant  attributes  his  failure  to   timely   file   his  Federal  and   state   income   tax
returns  and   subsequent  indebtedness   to   the   Federal  Government  to   his  wife’s
mismanagement of  their  finances; however,  he  accepts full  responsibility  for his failure
to   provide   greater  oversight  of   the   household  finances.   He  added   that  he   did  not
become  aware of  this security concern  until he “got notice of this potential action against
me  . . ..” (Tr. 21)
The following is a summary of Applicant’s five SOR allegations and their status:
SOR ¶  1.a  –  Failed to timely file Federal income returns for 2015, 2016, and
2017. Applicant admitted this allegation. He reiterated that he accepts responsibility for
his  tax  returns  not  being  filed  in  a  timely  manner.  He  explained  that  his  wife  was
supposed  to  be  working  with  a  neighbor  to  prepare  their  tax  returns,  but  that  did  not
happen. When  asked  about  his  wife’s  response  regarding  their  tax  returns,  he  stated,
“When the wife shrugs her shoulders, it’s hard for me to respond. So I  would say, no, I
was not aware.” (Tr. 20-21, 27)
Applicant submitted IRS transcripts for the respective tax years in question. For
tax year 2015, the IRS received his tax return on April 10, 2017. For tax year, 2016, the
IRS received his tax return on September 2, 2018. For tax year 2017, the IRS received
his tax return on February 27, 2019. For each of those three tax years, Applicant’s wife
requested  extensions,  but  those  returns  were  submitted  past  the  extended  deadlines
incurring penalties and late fees, discussed further, infra, in SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.d. (Tr.
27-28, GE 3; AE B)
Applicant’s reiterated throughout his testimony that he  “assumed his wife  was in
control” and that he “trusted her to be as such.” He stated that he was unaware that his
returns were filed late. Since tax concerns were brought to his attention, he has taken a
more active role in ensuring his tax returns are timely filed. Applicant’s spouse “contests
that she can do it (file taxes) herself. So it’s a very hot topic.”  (Tr. 23-25) He added that
in  the  past  his  wife  “made  a  boatload  of  money  (selling  real  estate)  - - that  means
thousands and thousands of dollars during many of those years, if not all of them, and I
believe that was the source of our problem with taxes.” In addition to selling real estate,
Applicant’s wife  was  involved  in “a couple of her other adventures. One is technology-
driven.” She did not have taxes deducted on any of that income and the taxes deducted
from  Applicant’s pay  was not enough to cover their joint tax liability. (Tr. 25-26, 46-47,
49)
Although not alleged as a concern, in order to demonstrate moving forward that
his  past  tax filing  shortcomings  were  under control,  Applicant  provided  IRS  transcripts
documenting that he timely filled his 2018, 2019, and 2020 Federal income tax returns.
He  was  owed  refunds of  $2,489, $3,224,  and  $6,070,  respectively,  amounts that have
been applied to back taxes owed for previous years, discussed  infra. (Tr. 25-28; AE D,
AE J, AE K, AE L) ALLEGATION RESOLVED.
SOR ¶  1.b  – Failed to timely pay state taxes for tax years 2011, 2015, 2016.
Applicant admitted this allegation. Applicant’s explanation for his failure to timely pay his
state  taxes  paralleled  his  explanation  under  SOR  ¶  1.a,  supra.  He  stated,  “I  was  not
involved. . . And I did not inquire.” He added that he was not aware that he owed state
taxes until he asked his wife about their taxes when he completed his SF-86 and these
proceedings  were  initiated.  Applicant  testified  that  it  was  his belief  that  his  state  taxes
were  up  to  date,  but  he  was  unable  to  state  with  certainty  that  was  the  case.  Post-
hearing,  he  submitted  documentation  from  his  state  tax  authority  that  reflects  his  tax
returns are current, and he has a zero balance for each tax year from 2011 to 2020. (Tr.
28-32; AE H, AE I, AE J) ALLEGATION RESOLVED.
SOR ¶¶  1.c  –  1.e  – Indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes
in the amounts of $955 for tax year 2014, $5,641 for tax year 2015, and $19,124 for
tax year 2017. Applicant admitted these allegations.
Applicant submitted IRS documentation dated May 14, 2021, and May 17, 2021,
from  his  2020  tax  filing  indicating  that  he  had  overpaid  his  taxes  that  year;  that  $964
was  applied  to  tax  owed  on  his  2014  tax  return;  and  that  $4,524  was  applied  to  tax
owed  on  his  2015  tax  return.  Applicant’s  IRS  documentation  dated  August  9,  2021,
indicates  that  he  paid  $428  to  pay  off  the  balance  owed  for  tax  year  2015.  Applicant
stated,  “Those  (referring  to  IRS  documentation)  are  meant  to  show  my  work  towards
rectifying the situation.”  (Tr. 33-; AE B, AE D, AE E)
With  regard  to  the  $19,124  owed  for  tax  year  2017,  Applicant  stated,  “I’m
chipping away at it.” Applicant stated that he set up a $200 monthly payment plan with
the IRS, “This year (2021), when I realized I couldn’t’ trust my wife, to be quite honest.”
However, his monthly payments have typically exceeded that amount averaging $400 a
month. He submitted recent IRS documentation dated August 9, 2021 and September
3, 2021, indicating that he had made monthly payments of $428 and $403, respectively.
(Tr. 37-42; AE E, AE F)
Post-hearing,  Applicant  submitted  his  IRS  transcript  dated  November  5,  2021
indicating  that  he  owes  a  balance  of  $12,477  for  tax  year  2017.  His  IRS  Payment
Activity  record  dated  November  5,  2021  indicates  that  he  has  been  making  monthly
payments to the IRS since January 2021 in amounts ranging from $200 to $500. (Tr. 48,
52-54; AE G, AE K) SOR ¶¶ 1.C & 1.D RESOLVED. SOR ¶ 1.E BEING RESOLVED.
Applicant realizes the importance of timely filing his Federal and state tax returns
and paying his Federal and state income taxes when due.  He has taken a much more
“hands  on” approach  and is committed to maintaining ongoing communication with his
wife with regard to their taxes. He realizes that his continued employment is dependent
on maintaining a security clearance. As the primary income earner in his household, this
responsibility weighs heavily on him. (Tr. 44-46) Applicant keeps his finances separate
from his wife to avoid similar problems. (Tr. 46)  He could not offer an explanation why
filing his tax returns became an  issue after so many years other than what appears to
be  a breakdown  in  communications between  him  and his wife. (Tr. 49, 57) He  did not
explain why he did not notice the filings were late at the time he signed his tax returns.
During his hearing, Applicant discussed his assets and expenses. He stated his
annual income was “approximately $180,000.” (Tr. 48) He rents a single family home for
$3,600 a month. He has also taken over the responsibility for maintaining the household
budget to include making the payments to the IRS and his wife’s car payments. He does
menu planning and household shopping. (Tr. 50-51)
Character Evidence
Post-hearing,  Applicant   submitted   a   reference   letter  from  a   company   manager,
who   has  worked   directly   and   indirectly   with   him   for  seven   years.  His  letter   described
Applicant as an  employee  who  can  be counted  on  to  complete  difficult tasks and  duties.
Applicant  has  helped   “solidify   a   vision   and   improve   business  processes  with   [defense
contractor].”  His  letter   also   described   Applicant  as  incredibly   dedicated   and   hard-
working, and as an  asset to the company. (AE M)
