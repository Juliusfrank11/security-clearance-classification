The  SOR (Item  1) alleges under Guideline  F that, as of  July  26, 2021, Applicant
owed  $19,599  in charged-off  debt on  ten  credit-card accounts (SOR ¶¶  1.a-1.g,  1.i-1.j,  and
1.l) and  $1,105  in collection  debt on  two  accounts  (SOR ¶¶  1.h  and  1.k). When  Applicant
responded  to  the  SOR  (Item  2), he admitted  each  of  the  debts,  but asserted  that he  fell  for
a  credit-repair  scam. He enrolled  in a  debt-consolidation  program  and  was told that he
would have  to  allow  his accounts to  become  delinquent for any  settlement negotiations. A
few  months into  the  program, he  “realized  that it had  become  unsustainable and  that [he]
had been a victim of a shady practice.”
After  considering  the  pleadings  and  Government  exhibits,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact:
Applicant is 37 years old. He has never married and has no children. He earned his
bachelor’s degree in September 2014. From September 2014 to July 2017, he worked for
an electronics retailer. He has worked as a program coordinator and fire-desk operator for
his current employer since July 2017. (Items 3, 4.) In February 2020, he received an offer
of employment from a defense contractor that is contingent on him obtaining a security
clearance. (Items 3, 4.)
On  March  10,  2020,  Applicant  completed  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security
Positions (SF 86), not having previously held a DOD security clearance. In response to an
SF 86 inquiry concerning any delinquency involving routine accounts, Applicant listed nine
charged-off accounts with five different creditors totaling $21,078, including the debts in
SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.g, and 1.i. He indicated that his financial issues primarily started around May
2019, due to increases in his rent, other living expenses, and to “sudden large expenses.”
He explained that he could not take any actions presently to resolve the debts because of
insufficient income and rent and other large expenses taking priority. He asserted that he
planned to pay the debts, when [he] secured increased income.” (Item 3.)
On April 9, 2020, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
OPM. He explained that his financial problems began when his monthly rent increased
from $1,150 to $1,270 around May 2019, and he had to choose which bills to pay. His rent
increased again, in February 2020, to $1,310 per month.  He explained that he tried to
repay his debts through a debt-consolidation company that took his money and made his
situation worse, so he dis-enrolled from the program and made some payments when he
could afford to do so. In addition to the debts disclosed on his SF 86, he discussed credit-
card accounts (SOR ¶ 1.j and 1.i), with respective balances of $642 and $612, and stated
that  he  would  make  payments  on  them  with  his  next  COVID-relief  stimulus  check  of
$1,200. He did not plan to repay the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e because it had been charged off.
When asked about other debts on his credit report (SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.h, 1.k, and 1.l), he did
not dispute them and added that he would pay off the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.k within
the next six months to one year. He planned in the future to be more financially responsible
and stated that he would pay off his past-due accounts; impose daily limits on his accounts
so  that  he  stayed  within  his income;  and  use  cash  rather than  credit  for purchases.  If
granted  a  clearance,  he  could  take  the  job  with  the  defense  contractor,  which  could
increase his annual income by $3,000. (Item 4.)
Applicant  was  re-contacted  by  the  investigator  on  April  13,  2020,  for  additional
information about his attempted debt repayment through the debt-consolidation process.
He gave estimated dates of October 2019 to January 2020 for when he paid into the plan.
He acknowledged that his accounts had been in collection before being charged off. He
stated that he had no intention of repaying  those debts that had been charged off. He
added that the $1,200 economic stimulus payment was pending deposit to his checking
account, and once it cleared, he would make minimum payments to bring some past-due
accounts up-to-date. (Item 4.)
A check of Applicant’s credit on March 2, 2021, showed that the accounts in SOR ¶¶
1.a-1.g, 1.i-1.j, and 1.l had been opened between May 2015 and December 2018. Some
reduction in balances was reflected with respect to three accounts: SOR ¶ 1.h from $1,054
to $668 in collection; SOR ¶ 1.k from $2,413 to $437 in collection; and SOR ¶ 1.l from
$795 to $284 charged-off after collection. His credit report showed that he made payments
according to terms on other debts: a car loan obtained in November 2015 for $27,870 with
monthly  payments  of  $599  for  72  months  (balance  $8,685);  a  credit  card  obtained  in
December 2017 with a $900 credit limit (balance $858); two telecommunications accounts
opened in January 2019 and July 2020 (balances $175 and $135); and a utility account
opened in August 2020 (balance $57). (Item 5.)
As of January 2022, Applicant was making timely payments of $496 per month on a
new  car  loan  obtained  in  March  2021  for  $26,111.  He  was  also  making  payments
according to account terms on $6,501 in outstanding credit-card balances on five accounts
opened between October 2017 and October 2021. None of the charged-off balances listed
in the SOR were on his January 2022 credit report. (Item 2.)
Applicant  asserts  in  mitigation  that  the  debt-consolidation  firm  told  him  that  his
accounts would have to be delinquent before the creditors would agree to any settlements,
and by the time he realized he had fallen for “a shady practice,” he could not undo the
damage to his credit. He maintains that had he known the negative impact on his credit, he
would  not  have  acquiesced  to  the  debt-relief  program.  He  cited  his  record  of  timely
payments on his open accounts. As for his charged-off delinquencies, he stated, “At the
time of [his] investigation, all delinquent accounts had been charged off by the original
creditor.” He expressed regret for trying the debt-relief program but did not indicate that he
would attempt to resolve his charged-off debts. (Item 2.)
