In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.m and 1.o.
(Item  2)  He  denied  the  other  SOR  allegations.  (Id.)  He  also  provided  mitigating
information. (Id.) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 38-year-old security officer who has worked for a defense contractor
since  February  2020.  (Item  3  at  7,  11-12)  From  July  2019  to  February  2020,  he  was
employed as an appliance technician. (Id. at 12) From November 2018 to July 2019, he

November 2018, he was unemployed. (Id. at 14-15) From June 2006 to July 2018, he
was employed as a corrections officer. (Id. at 15) He served in the Army National Guard
from January 2001 to July 2007, and he received an honorable discharge. (Id. at 17)
Applicant married in 2011, and he does not have any children. (Item 3 at 20-21) In

Financial Considerations
Applicant  did  not  disclose  any  debts  placed  for  collection  or  charged  off  in  the
previous seven years on his March 22, 2020 SCA. (Item 1) On April 23, 2020, an Office
of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator interviewed Applicant about his delinquent
debts.  (Item  9) He  was  confronted  with  the negative  financial  information  on  his credit
report, including the SOR debts in collection or charged off, and he admitted his student
loans were in collections. (Id. at 1-2) Applicant told the OPM investigator that the collection
agent  for  his  federal  student  loans  contacted  him  in  2018,  and  he  entered  into  a  $5
monthly rehabilitation agreement. (Id.) Applicant said that he paid the account on time
after completion of the rehabilitation agreement. (Id. at 2) He said the debt in SOR ¶ 1.m
is in good standing; he denied that he owed the insurance debt in SOR ¶ 1.n; and he was
unaware of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.o. (Id. at 2-3) Later in his OPM interview, he  said the
creditor for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.o was the university which refused to give him his diploma
for  his  bachelor’s  degree  until  he  paid  the  debt.  (Id.  at  5)  The  OPM  investigator  gave
Applicant  an  “opportunity  to  provide  additional  documentation  regarding  financial
delinquencies;” however, he “failed to provide during the interview or subsequent to the
interview  [documents]  to  corroborate  [his]  disagreement  with  accounts  on  the  Credit
Bureau Report.” (Id. at 3)
In  March  2020,  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  Department  of
Education (DE) placed federal student loans in forbearance. On December 22, 2021, the
DE extended the student loan payment pause through May 1, 2022. The pause includes
the  following  relief  measures  for  eligible  loans:  a  suspension  of  loan  payments;  a  0%
interest  rate;  and  stopped  collections  on  defaulted  loans.  See  Federal  Student  Aid
website, https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19.
Applicant’s April 9, 2020 credit report shows the 12 student loans in the collections
section. (Item 5 at 8-11) They were assigned to collections on the following dates: ¶ 1.a
$6,995 (December 2015); ¶ 1.b for $5,200 (May 2014); ¶ 1.c for $5,150 (December 2015);
¶ 1.d for $4,213 (April 2012); ¶ 1.e for $3,277 (July 2011); ¶ 1.f for $2,114 (March 2017);
¶ 1.g for $2,063  (May 2014); ¶ 1.h for $1,986  (July 2011); ¶ 1.i for $1,063  (December
2012); ¶ 1.j for $977 (December 2012); ¶ 1.k for $822 (March 2017); and ¶ 1.l for $542
(April 2012). (Id.) They are all shown as closed and assigned to the government. (Id.)
On February 10, 2021, Applicant responded to DOD CAF interrogatories and said
the 12 federal student loans were paid, and then he checked the block indicating payment
arrangement have been made. (Item 4 at 3-6) The DOHA interrogatory instructions ask
for proof of making payments and documentation of payment arrangements. (Id. at 2) It
also  includes  examples  of  acceptable  documentation,  such  as  copies  of  cancelled
checks,  bank  statements,  correspondence  from  the  creditor,  a  record  of  payment
arrangements including payment history, and a credit report showing the account is paid,
settled  in  full,  or  being  paid  as  agreed.  (Id.  at  7)  He  attached  an  incomplete  personal
financial statement, and a pay statement from his employment for November 2020. (Id.
at 10-11)
Applicant’s  February  24,  2021  credit  report  shows  the  12  student  loans  in
collections. (Item 6 at 2-4) The debts  were  reported as  being in  collections  in October
2020. (Id.) This credit report also reflects that in January 2021, his 12 student loans were
reported as $0 past due and in pays as agreed status. (Id. at 7-9)
The June 14, 2021 SOR alleges 12 federal student loans placed for collection as
follows: ¶ 1.a for $6,995; ¶ 1.b for $5,201; ¶ 1.c for $5,151; ¶ 1.d for $4,213; ¶ 1.e for
$3,278; ¶ 1.f for $2,114; ¶ 1.g for $2,063; ¶ 1.h for $1,986; ¶ 1.i for $1,063; ¶ 1.j for $978;
¶ 1.k for $822; and ¶ 1.l for $542. (Item 1) The SOR alleges three additional delinquent
debts as follows: ¶ 1.m is a charged-off bank debt for $409; ¶ 1.n is an insurance debt
placed for collection for $162; and ¶ 1.o is a charged-off private education debt for $2,874.
Applicant’s  July  13,  2021  SOR  response  states,  “I  have  worked  with  a  Student
Loan company to make my payments manageable and they are in good standing.” (Item
2 at 4) He provided a July 11, 2021 credit report which indicated his $34,406 in student
loans were a “closed account” and not listed as collection accounts. (Id. at 5-7) He said
he paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.n ($162) two years ago, and it is not on his current credit
report. (Id. at 4) He said he is working on paying the debts in SOR ¶ 1.m ($409) and ¶ 1.o
($2,874). He did not provide copies of any documents he sent to the creditors or received
from  the  creditors.  He  did  not  provide  copies  of  bank  statements  or  other  documents
showing payments to the SOR creditors. He did not provide a history of his student loan
payments.
Applicant’s September 24, 2021  credit report  shows the  12  student  loans in the
collections  section  with  the  most  recent  activity  being  in  December  2017  with  a  $5
scheduled payment and their status as being transferred. (Item 7 at 9-11) It also shows
the accounts in pays as agreed status, payments from October 2020 to present, and a $0
past due balance. (Id. at 3-7)
The FORM credited Applicant with bringing his student loans to current status, but
indicated his history of handling his student loans, including not resuming payments until
October  2020,  warranted  denial  of  his  security  clearance.  (FORM  at  4)  The  FORM
the  absence  of
described  Applicant’s  security-significant  behavior  and  noted
corroborating documentation of mitigation. The FORM informed Applicant that he had 30
days  from  the  receipt  of  the  FORM  in  which  “to  submit  a  documentary  response
setting  forth  objections,  rebuttal,  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  explanation,  as
appropriate.  .  .  .  If  [Applicant  does]  not  file  any  objections  or  submit  any  additional
information . . . [his] case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination
based solely” on the evidence set forth in this FORM. (FORM at 4-5 (emphasis added))
Applicant did not provide a response to the FORM.
