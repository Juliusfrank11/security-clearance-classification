Applicant  is  a  46-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  she  has
worked since July 2020. She earned a high school degree in 1994. She has taken some
college courses intermittently over the years, but has not earned a college degree. She
has been married and divorced twice. Her first marriage was from 1997 until 2006. Her
second marriage was from 2013 until 2017. She has three adult children. She enlisted
with  the  U.S.  Army  Reserve  in  February  2005  and  earned  an  honorable  discharge  in
September 2005, when  she enlisted  with  the  U.S. Army on active  duty.  She remained
on active duty with the U.S. Army until February 2018. In February 2018, she earned an
honorable  discharge  after  being  “medically  retired.”  She  received  40  percent  of  her
military pay after her retirement and also received a medical pension from the military at
a 90 percent rating. While on active duty, she was deployed to  Iraq from August 2010
until June 2011. She was granted a clearance in 2005 and 2017. (Items 4, 5)
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  owes  19  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $51,000
(SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.q,  1.t,  and  1.u).  The  delinquent  debts  include,  among  other  things,
student loans, credit cards, medical debts, and a military overpayment. Applicant denied
the debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.q. She  admitted the remaining debts in
the  SOR;  some  with  additional  comment.  Her  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of
fact.  I  find  that  the  SOR  allegations  are  established  through  credit  reports,  Applicant’s
admissions, and the information she provided during her interview in September 2020.
(Items 1, 3, 5-8)
Applicant  attributed  her  financial  problems  to  bad  financial  decisions  that  her
second former spouse made while they were married. She claimed that he controlled all
of  her  finances  and  squandered  almost  $100,000  of  her  money  by  making  bad
investments.  She  was  unemployed  from  February  2018  until  about  August  2018  after
she  retired  from  the  military  and  decided  to  take  some  time  off.  She  was  also
unemployed  from  January  2019  until  about  July  2020  after  she  quit  her  job  to  move
back home with her family because she was having financial difficulties. (Items 4, 5)
The $9,493 debt alleged in ¶ 1.a has not been resolved. Applicant claimed that
this  debt  was  being  paid  through  a  military  allotment  during  an  unspecified  period  of
time  while  she  was  in  the  military.  Those  payments  stopped  when  she  retired  in
February 2018. She provided no documentation to support her allegation that she had
made  payments  on  this  account.  The  debt  appears  on  Applicant’s  2020,  2021,  and
2022 credit reports. (Items 1, 3, 5-8)
The   $6,823   debt   alleged   in  ¶   1.b   has   been   resolved.   Applicant’s  2022   credit
report reflects that this  account  was settled  for less than  the  full  balance.  (Items  1,  3,  5-
8)
The  student  loan  debts  alleged  in  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.d  have  not  been  resolved.
Applicant  presented no  documentary evidence  that  she has made payments, disputed
these debts, offered or negotiated payment agreements, or taken any significant action
to resolve these debts. These debts appear on Applicant’s 2020, 2021, and 2022 credit
reports. (Items 1, 3, 5-8)
The credit-card debts alleged in ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f have not been resolved. Applicant
presented  no  documentary  evidence  to  show  that  she  has  made  payments,  disputed
these debts, offered or negotiated payment agreements, or taken any significant action
to resolve these debts. These debts appear on Applicant’s 2020, 2021, and 2022 credit
reports. (Items 1, 3, 5-8)
The credit-card debts alleged in ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h have not been resolved. Applicant
claimed  that  these  are  duplicate  debts,  but  the  information  contained  in  the  credit
reports  does  not  support  this  claim.  Instead,  despite  having  the  identical  balance,  the
credit  reports  reflect  that  these  two  accounts  had  different  original creditors.  Applicant
presented  no  documentary  evidence  to  show  that  she  has  made  payments,  disputed
these debts, offered or negotiated payment agreements, or taken any significant action
to  resolve  these debts.  She also failed to provide  documentary evidence  showing that
these debts concern the same account. These debts appear on Applicant’s 2020, 2021,
and 2022 credit reports. (Items 1, 3, 5-8)
The  $687  credit-card  debt  alleged  in  ¶  1.i  has  not  been  resolved.  Applicant
presented  no  documentary  evidence  to  show  that  she  has  made  payments,  disputed
this debt, offered or negotiated a payment agreement, or taken any significant action to
resolve this debt. This debt appears on Applicant’s 2020, 2021, and 2022 credit reports.

1, 3, 5-8)
The  $480  credit-card  debt  alleged  in  ¶  1.k  has  not  been  resolved.  Applicant
claimed  that  this debt  was  a  duplicate  of  the  debt  described  in  ¶  1.s,  which  has  been
stricken from the SOR. She failed to provide documentary evidence showing that these
debts concern the same account. She presented no documentary evidence to show that
she  has  made  payments,  disputed  this  debt,  offered  or  negotiated  a  payment
agreement,  or  taken  any  significant  action  to  resolve  this  debt.  This  debt  appears  on
Applicant’s 2020, 2021, and 2022 credit reports. (Items 1, 3, 5-8)
The  $392  credit-card  debt  alleged  in  ¶  1.l  has  not  been  resolved.  Applicant
claimed  that  this  debt  was  a  duplicate  of  the  debt  described  in  ¶  1.r,  which  has  been
stricken from the SOR. She failed to provide documentary evidence showing that these
debts concern the same account. She presented no documentary evidence to show that
she  has  made  payments,  disputed  this  debt,  offered  or  negotiated  a  payment
agreement,  or  taken  any  significant  action  to  resolve  this  debt.  This  debt  appears  on
Applicant’s 2020, 2021, and 2022 credit reports. (Items 1, 3, 5-8)

presented  no  evidence  that  she  has  made  payments,  disputed  this  debt,  offered  or
negotiated  a  payment  agreement,  or  taken  any  significant  action  to  resolve  this  debt.
This debt appears on Applicant’s 2020, 2021, and 2022 credit reports. (Items 1, 3, 5-8)
The   medical  debts  alleged   in   ¶¶   1.n,   1.o,   and   1.q   have   not  been   resolved.
Applicant  denied   these   debts  because   she   didn’t  recognize   them   and   has  medical
insurance.  For  the   medical  debt   listed   in   ¶   1.n,  Applicant  acknowledged   that   her
daughter   was  treated   in  the   hospital,   but  that  medical  insurance   should   have   covered
any  amount  owed.  Applicant presented  no  documentary  evidence  to  show  that she  has
made   payments,  disputed   these   debts,  offered   or  negotiated   payment  agreements,  or
taken  any  significant  action  to  resolve  these  debts. The  debt  described  in ¶  1.n  appears
on  Applicant’s 2020, 2021, and  2022  credit reports.  The  debts described  in ¶¶  1.o  and
1.q  appear  on Applicant’s 2021  and 2022 credit reports.  (Items 1, 3, 5-8)
The  $100  lease  debt  described  in  ¶  1.p  has  not  been  resolved.  Applicant
presented no documentary evidence that she has  made payments, disputed this debt,
offered  or  negotiated  a  payment  agreement,  or  taken  any  significant  action  to  resolve
this debt. This debt appears on Applicant’s 2020 and 2021 credit reports, but not on her
2022 credit report. (Items 1, 3, 5-7)
The $4,222 credit-card debt described in  ¶ 1.t has not been resolved.  Applicant
presented  no  documentary  evidence  to  show  that  she  has  made  payments,  disputed
this debt, offered or negotiated a payment agreement, or taken any significant action to
resolve  this  debt.  This  debt  appears  on  Applicant’s  2020  and  2021  credit  reports,  but
not on her 2022 credit report. (Items 1, 3, 5-7)
The $20,495 government overpayment described in ¶ 1.u has not been resolved.
This debt resulted from Applicant receiving four to five months of full military pay after
she  retired.  Applicant  claimed  that  she  mistakenly thought  these  monthly credits  were
her VA benefits. When the government demanded she repay the overpayments, she did
not  have  enough  money to  do  so.  She  has been  repaying this debt  through  bi-weekly
garnishments. While she provided no documentary evidence of these garnishments, her
2022 credit report reflects a diminished balance of $15,332. This debt also appears on
her 2020 credit report, but not on her 2021 credit report. (Items 1, 3, 5, 6, 8)
As  of  September  2020,  Applicant’s  take-home  income  through  wages  and
disability  was  $4,942  per  month.  Her  total  monthly  expenses  were  $1,200  per  month,
leaving her with a net remainder of $3,742 per month. She claimed that she will repay
the  delinquent  debts  that  she  thinks  she  owes  after  she  investigates  their  validity.  In
February  and  October  2021,  Applicant  opened  two  new  installment  loans  secured  by
vehicles.  The  loan  amount  for  these  vehicles  was  a  combined  total  of  about  $47,000.
Her combined monthly payment on these vehicles is about $943. Applicant is no more
than four payments past due on an additional debt not listed in the SOR.1  Applicant did

consider it when applying matters of extenuation and mitigation, and for the whole-person analysis.
not  respond  to  the  FORM,  so  more  recent  information  about  her  finances  is  not
available. (Items 5, 8)
