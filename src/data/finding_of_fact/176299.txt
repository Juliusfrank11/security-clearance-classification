In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  four  delinquent  debts  totaling
about  $8,000  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.d).  It  also  alleged  that  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his
2018  and  2019 Federal income tax returns  (SOR  ¶ 1.e.).  In his response  to the SOR,
Applicant  admitted  the  debts  in  ¶¶  1.a-1.d,  but  denied  that  he  failed  to  timely  file  his
2018 and 2019 Federal tax returns. In his response to the SOR he claimed that, in early
2020,  he  mailed  his 2018  and  2019  Federal tax  returns,  but  the  IRS  failed  to  process
them.  He  stated  that  he  also  filed  his  state  income  tax  returns  for  State  A  and  has
received refunds from State A. He claimed that he has since mailed his 2018 and 2019
Federal tax returns to the IRS two more times without an acknowledgement of receipt.
In his response to the SOR, he alleged that the IRS owed him about $15,000 to $20,000
in tax refunds. (Items 1-6)
The  information  Applicant  provided  regarding  these  Federal  tax  returns  in  the
Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  he  submitted  in  July  2020  is
inconsistent with the information he provided in his response to the SOR. In his SF 86,
he  acknowledged  that  he  failed  to  timely  file  his  2018  Federal  tax  return  because  of
issues with his ex-wife. He further claimed in his SF 86 that he had not and could not file
his  2019  Federal  tax  return  until  the  IRS  processed  his  late  2018  Federal  tax  return.
According to the information he provided in his SF 86, Applicant had not filed his 2019
Federal  tax  return  as  of  July  2020.  He  provided  no  evidence  that  he  requested  an
extension  with  the  IRS.  Therefore,  his  entries  in  his  SF  86  and  lack  of  proof  of  an
extension  request  establish  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶  1.e.  The  SOR  allegations  are
established  through  Applicant’s  admissions,  his  entries  in  his  SF  86,  and  the  other
Government exhibits. (Items 1-6)
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  his  unemployment,  his  divorce,
record inflation, supporting a family as the sole breadwinner, and not receiving Federal
income tax refunds from the IRS. He was unemployed for a period from about August
2012 to April 2013, while he attended college, and from August 2016 to April 2018. His
August 2016 unemployment began when he quit his job instead of being fired after he
lost  his  commercial  driver’s  license  as  a  result  of  a  driving  under  the  influence  (DUI)
conviction.1  Applicant  provided  a  Personal  Financial  Statement  with  his  July  2021
interrogatory responses that showed he had a net remainder of $857 per month. (Items

The  late  filing  of  Applicant’s  2018  and  2019  Federal  tax  returns  remains
unresolved. While Applicant claimed he mailed these tax returns three separate times,
he provided no documentary proof to corroborate this assertion, such as copies of these
tax returns or proof of mailing. Instead, he provided Wage and Income Transcripts from
the IRS for the 2018 and 2019 tax years. These documents are filed with the IRS by his
employer and show how much money Applicant earned from his employer in the given
tax year, but do not provide proof of tax return filing. (Items 1-6)
Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM,  so  more  recent  information  about  his
finances is not available.
