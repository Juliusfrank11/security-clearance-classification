Applicant is 57 years old. He has been married since 1985, and has an almost 39-
year-old stepson and a 33-year-old son. He received a high school diploma in 1983. He
served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1983 until he honorably retired in October
2008 as a sergeant first class. He has primarily worked for Defense contractors since he
retired  from  the  military,  and  he  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  as  a  survival,
evasion,  resistance,  and  escape  instructor,  since  August  2020.  He  held  a  security
clearance  while  in  the  Army  and  was  granted  a  top  secret  clearance  in  approximately
2021. (Item 4; Item 6)
The   SOR  alleged   that   Applicant  failed   to   file   his  federal  and   state   income   tax
returns for tax  years (TY) 2013  through  2019, and  they  remain unfiled. Additionally, he
owes the  federal government $133,196  for TY  2013  through  2019, and  he  owes his state
$32,238  for TY 2013 through 2019. In his Answer to the SOR, he  admitted that he  made
a  mistake, and  indicated  that he  has “been  in the  process of  correcting  that mistake  since
June of  2020.” He admitted  all four SOR allegations and provided  documentation, which
is  discussed in depth below.  (Item  1; Item 3; Item  5; Item 6)
After Applicant retired from the Army in October 2008, he was unemployed from
October  2008  to  January 2009.  Since  regaining  employment  in  January 2009,  he  has
worked for various Defense contractors. He worked overseas from April 2011 until August
2020, when he returned to the United States due a reduction in force from the COVID-19
pandemic. While he was working overseas, he and his wife did not file federal or state
income tax returns.
We   were  under  the   impression   since   we   were   Expats  living   and   working
overseas, we  had  up  to  seven  years before we  had  to  submit our income
tax. We  also had a  family member who received a diagnose (sic) of cancer
which became  terminal. Because of our misunderstanding of the tax codes
and  family  issues, we  did not focus on  filing  our taxes. We  have  retained
the  serves (sic) of [TaxService]  to  represent us before the  IRS. They  have
made  contact with  the  IRS  on  our behalf. Because  we  contacted  the  IRS
first,   they   are  working   with   us  so   we   can   get  back  in  good   standing   with
them. None  of  our assets have  been  or will be  frozen  or seized. Mr. [C] from
[TaxService]  is  our Power of  Attorney  within the  IRS  Records.  (Item  4  at 51-
54)
Applicant completed a SCA in September 2020, and he was asked to disclose his
tax  history  dating  back  seven  years.  He  admitted  the  information  above  regarding  TY
2013 through 2019. Although he was living overseas, for at least part of TY 2011 and all
of TY 2012, it is unknown from the record evidence if he failed to file his tax returns for
TY  2011  and  2012  in  a  timely manner,  and  these  TYs  are  not  alleged.  Additionally,  it
appears from the documentation that he did not file TY 2020 in a timely manner, and he
owes the IRS for this TY as well, however, this TY is not alleged. None of the unalleged
TY will not be considered as disqualifying. (Item 4; Item 5; Item 6)
In November 2020, a few months after Applicant returned to the United States, he
was interviewed by a Government investigator. He confirmed the information he provided
in  his  2020  SCA  regarding  his  2013  through  2019  federal  and  state  tax  returns  was
accurate. Additionally, he acknowledged that he was embarrassed that he allowed his tax
issue to happen; he should have known better; and he should have checked or confirmed
his belief that he was exempt from filing tax returns because he was living and working
overseas. He also disclosed that his personal matters during this time period (his son was
diagnosed with brain cancer; he and his wife had three family members pass away; and
his  wife  had  to  return  every  three  months  to  the  United  States  for  prescription
medications) overwhelmed him, which also led him to forgot to deal with his tax issues as
well. (Item 5; Item 6)
After Applicant and his wife returned to the United States, he hired a company (Tax
Service) to represent them with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). During his November
2020 interview, he told the investigator that he had filed all of his income tax returns two
weeks  earlier.  At that time, he  did not know what  he owed, as  he was  waiting for  Tax
Service  to  work  with  the  IRS  to  determine  what  he  and  his  wife  owed.  He  told  the
investigator that he was not purposefully not paying his taxes, he was just confused and
overwhelmed by the process. In his March 2021 interrogatories, he further clarified that
he  and  his  wife  lost  four  siblings  and  his  wife  had  a  nervous  breakdown,  attempted
suicide, was hospitalized, and was diagnosed with major depression disorder, all of which
contributed to his inability to file his tax returns. (Item 5; Item 6)

Applicant indicated in his March 2021 interrogatories that he contacted his State
Department of Revenue (SDOR), but did provide a date for when he initiated contact. He
also  claimed  that the SDOR does not provide  tax account transcripts.  However, in  his
August 2021 response to interrogatories, he provided copies of SDOR notice of collection
letters for TY 2014 to 2019. As noted in the chart, he owes significantly more money for
each TY year than he claimed he owed. Additionally, he included documentation from the
IRS, which includes the actual amount that he owes the IRS for TY 2019, but he did not
include documentation from the IRS for the remaining TYs in question. He provided no
documentation indicating the IRS accepted his tax returns for the other alleged TYs. In
his August 2021 response to interrogatories, he admitted that he owes the IRS $133,196
and SDOR $32,238, and at that time, he did not have an installment agreement with either
entity. The IRS had processed no payments in the past five years from applicant. There
is  no  documentation  in  the  record  from  either  the  IRS  or  SDOR  that  either  entity  has
forgiven TY 2013, and is not requiring Applicant to either file or pay taxes for this year.
(Item 5 at 7; Item 6)
In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he provided a February 2022 letter from Tax
Service, the company that he retained in June 2020 to help him resolve his outstanding
federal  and  state  taxes.  According  to  Tax  Service,  “We  have  gotten  [Applicant]  into
compliance  with  [his]  missing  tax  return  filings  2014  –  2020  years.  We  are  currently
waiting the tax returns for 2015, 2016, 2017 & 2020 years to be assessed by the [IRS]
after which we  will set  an agreement for  2014 –  2020 tax liabilities. We have set up a
resolution with [SDOR] with monthly installment agreements.” Applicant did not provide
documentation from the IRS regarding TY 2014 and 2018 and its updated assessment.
(AE B)
Applicant  submitted   a   January   2022   authorization   for  bank  draft  payment
agreement between  himself and  the  SDOR  starting  on  February  28,  2022.  His checking
account is going  to  be  auto-drafted  $1,129.90  monthly  for 60  months. In  January  2022,
his  total outstanding  debt to  SDOR was $67,793.83. The  payments were to  start after he
submitted   his  response   to   the   FORM;   therefore,  there   is   no   proof  of   payments   in   the
record. Nor did he  provide  a  budget to  demonstrate  his ability  to  make  these  payments.
