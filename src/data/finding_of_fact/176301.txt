Applicant admitted  the  SOR  allegations  in  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b, 1.j and  denied  1.c through
1.i. Applicant’s admissions are  included  in the  findings of fact. After a  thorough  and  careful
review of the  pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the  following findings of  fact.
Applicant  is  58  years  old.  He  attended  college,  but  did  not  earn  a  degree.  He
served in the Air Force Reserve from 1986 to 1995 and was honorably discharged. He
married in 1995 and divorced in 2016. He has two grown children. He has been employed
by his present employer, a federal contractor, since April 2020. He was unemployed and
on disability from June 2015 to  April 2020. Before then he was employed by a federal
contractor from January 2011 to June 2015. (Item 3)
In  Applicant’s February 2021  security  clearance  application  (SCA), he  disclosed
three delinquent debts. Applicant attributed his financial problems to his unemployment
due  to  his  health  and  his  wife  passing  away  in  2016.  He  stated  to  the  government
investigator during his March 2021 interview that he was laid off from a position in 2015
and  was  supported  by  a  severance  package  and  his  wife’s  disability  until  she  passed
away in May 2016. He received  Social Security disability in November 2016. Applicant
was taking care of his son and looking for work. He was self-employed as an Uber driver
from August 2015 to December 2015. At some point, Applicant’s health became an issue
and he had a kidney transplant. The details and timeframe were not provided. He told the
investigator that now that his health was better, his finances were improving. However,
he did not intend to repay his debts for repossessed vehicles because they were over five
years old. (Items 3, 4)
During  Applicant’s  background  interview  by  a  government  investigator,  he
acknowledged owing the debt in SOR ¶ 1.j ($18,636) for a vehicle he purchased in August
2015 that was later repossessed in December 2015. He told the investigator that the debt
should be charged off and he does not plan on paying it because he returned the vehicle
over five years ago. This debt is unresolved. (Item 4 pages 7-10)
In Applicant’s July 2021 response to interrogatories, he stated: “Working on a plan
to have the medical collections paid of[f] in a month (end of Aug 2021).” Medical debts
are alleged in SOR ¶¶1.c ($482), 1.d ($459), 1.g ($67), and 1.h ($63). He subsequently
denied these debts in the SOR answer stating they had either been paid in full or removed
from  his  credit  report.  No  supporting  documents  were  provided.  They  are  unresolved.
(Item 2, Item 4 pages 3, 7-10, Item 5)
Applicant  acknowledged  to  the  investigator  that  he  owed  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.i
($7,195), which was for a personal loan he obtained in 2013 or 2014. He was unable to
pay  it  when  he  lost  his  job.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  planned  on  contacting  the
creditor and negotiating a settlement agreement and pay it as soon as he could. In his
SOR answer he denied the debt stating that it either had been paid in full or had been
removed from his credit report. He did not provide any documents to support his claim.
The debt is unresolved. (Item 2, Item 4 pages 7-10)
Applicant acknowledged to the investigator that he owed the debt alleged in SOR
¶ 1.e (collection account for utility bill-$431) for an electric bill that he could not pay when
he lost his job in 2015. He intended to pay the bill as soon as possible. In his SOR answer,
he denied the debt stating that it either had been paid in full or had been removed from
his  credit  report.  He  did  not  provide  any  documents  to  support  his  claim.  The  debt  is
unresolved. (Item 2, Item 4 pages 7-10)
Applicant admitted the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($11,795) and acknowledged it to the
investigator. He explained to the investigator that the amount was alleged by a former
landlord for damages and because Applicant had not removed all of his property from the
premises. Applicant disputed the debt and told the investigator that he intended to take
the landlord to court. Applicant did not provide any evidence as to his actions to resolve
or dispute the debt. It remains unresolved. (Item 2, Item 4 pages 7-10)
Applicant admitted the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($1,412). He explained to the investigator
that  the  debt  was  incurred  in  2015  after  he  lost  his  job  and  was  sick.  He  was  now
employed and intended to pay this debt as soon as possible. He did not provide evidence
that the debt was paid or resolved. (Item 2, Item 4)
Applicant stated that he arranged a settlement agreement with the creditor for the
debt in SOR ¶ 1.f ($78). The supporting documents show that an agreement was reached
and Applicant paid $701 towards the original amount of $779. It appears the remaining
balance alleged in SOR 1.f was the amount the creditor agreed to forgive. In Applicant’s
interrogatory response, he stated that he had followed up with the creditor for the debt
and was told his credit report would be updated regarding it. I find in Applicant’s favor on
this allegation. (Item 2, Item 4 at 3-10, 13-17, Item 6)
Applicant’s  admissions  in  the  SOR,  interrogatory  responses,  and  background
interview, a credit report from March 2021, and a state document verifying a judgment
corroborate the SOR allegations. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
