The  SOR  contains  one  allegation that  Applicant  used marijuana from  January
2012  to  November  2021.  (Answer  to  SOR)  In  her  February  14,  2022  answer,  she
admitted the allegation, but contended that since 2016, she only uses the drug clinically
for  anxiety  or  depression,  not  recreationally.  She  noted  that  the  drug  has  been
decriminalized  in  the  jurisdiction  where  she  lives.  She  indicated  that  her  future  use
would be as needed.
Applicant  is  25  years  old  and  single  with  a  four-year-old  son.  She  attended
college between 2014 and 2016, and 2017 to the present, but received no degree. She
is  currently  being  sponsored  by  a  defense  contractor,  and  has  been  working  as  a
community support worker since March 2020. She was unemployed from August 2019
to  March  2020.  She  was  employed  in  three  restaurant  positions  between  November
2017 and August 2019. (Item 2 at 10-22)
In her March 2021 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that she used marijuana. (Item 2)
Her  reason  for  use  was  anxiety  and  depression.  Although  she  was  not  formally
diagnosed by a doctor, she discussed her use with her mental health practitioner. She
noted  that  her  first  use  was  in  2012.  Her  most  recent  use  was  in  March  2021.  She
indicated that, “I have not used marijuana  consistently since 2011 (she probably meant
to  state  2012  because  she  identified  her  first  use  as  2012).  She  noted,  “However[,]
since the beginning of 2020, I have used it on an as needed basis.”  (Item 2 at 34) She
indicated  that  she  did  not  intend  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future.  Instead,  after  her
discussions with her mental health practitioner of alternative methods of easing anxiety,
she  intended  to  use  medication,  writing,  and  gaming  to  relieve  her  anxiety.  Applicant
never sought treatment for marijuana use. (Item 2 at 33-35)
In her April 26, 2021 PSI with the OPM investigator, Applicant stated she was
using marijuana three times a week, but, less than two months after she submitted her
e-QIP,  she  could  not  recall  when  she  first  started  using  the  drug.  She  noted  that  she
was purchasing about seven grams of the drug as needed. In  her November 23, 2021
interrogatory answers, she claimed her first use was in January 2019 and her last use
was  in  November  2021.  She  described  her  marijuana  use  as  occurring  three  to  four
times  a  week.  Her  future  intentions  were  to  use  marijuana  to  reduce  stress,  but  she
would discontinue use if required. On November 23, 2021, Applicant indicated that her
interrogatory  answers  were  accurate.  On  November  29,  2021,  she  confirmed  that  the
April  2021  PSI  accurately  reflected  the  discussions  she  had  with  the  investigator.
Applicant chose not to respond to the FORM. (Item 3 at 1-8)
