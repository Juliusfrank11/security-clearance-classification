Under Guideline  F,  the  Government alleged  that Applicant   did  not  timely  file   his
federal  income  tax  returns for at least the  2013  through  2017  tax  years (SOR 1.a); that
he  failed to  pay, as required, his federal income taxes for at least the 2013 through 2016
tax  years (SOR 1.b); and  that he  owed  the  IRS  $18,312.85  for unpaid  income  taxes from
the  2014  through  2016  tax  years (SOR 1.c).  In  response  to the  SOR, Applicant  admitted
with  explanations all  of the  SOR allegations.  He also  provided  a  recent copy  of his pay
stub  and a record of tax payments made between August 2017 and July 2019.  (Answer)
On  August 17, 2021, after receiving  a pre-hearing   copy   of  Applicant’s proposed
exhibits,  Department Counsel moved  to  amend  the  SOR. SOR 1.b, as amended, alleged
that  Applicant’s failure to  timely  pay  his federal income  taxes occurred  between  2013  and
2018. SOR 1.c,  as  amended,  alleged  that Applicant owes $28,451.50  for unpaid taxes
from  the  2014  through  2018  tax  years. Applicant  denied  SOR  1.b  and  1.c,  as  amended.
After  reviewing   the   proposed   exhibits  and   allowing   the   parties  to   be   heard,  I  granted
Department   Counsel’s   motion   and   amended   the   SOR  to   conform   to   the   evidence   as
provided  by  Directive, Section  E3.1.17.  (Tr.  11  –  18) In  view  of the  foregoing  pleadings
and   according   to   findings  by   the   Appeal  Board  on   remand,  the   following   facts  are
established.
Applicant  is  55  years  old.  Since  March  2003,  he  has  worked  for  a  defense
contractor as an information technology systems field engineer, a position that requires
eligibility for access to classified information for access to military facilities at home and
abroad. Applicant has held a security clearance since at least March 2004. He also served
in the Army on active duty between 1984 and 1993. Thereafter, he affiliated with the Army
Reserve until retiring in 2017. After leaving active duty, he earned an associate’s degree
in  applied  science  and  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  technology  management.  He  has  been
married since 1987 and has three children, one of whom is still his dependent. (GX 1; Tr.
46 – 48)
Between  2003  and  2017,  Applicant  was  sent  at  least  five  times  by  his  civilian
employer to work in direct support of U.S. military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait,
and Qatar. He disclosed in his 2018 e-QIP that he filed his federal and state income tax
returns late for the 2012, 2013, and 2017 tax years, and that he owed a total of $4,100 in
unpaid  taxes  for  those  years.  Information  obtained  by  investigators  and  adjudicators
during the ensuing background investigation showed that Applicant did not file his federal
income tax returns on time for the 2013, 2016, and 2017 tax years. (Answer; GX 1; GX
2; AX A – H; AX J; Tr. 48, 85 – 86)
Information   obtained   during   Applicant’s  background   investigation   shows  that   he
owed   $18,132.85   for   unpaid  taxes  in   the   2014   through   2016   tax   years.  At   hearing,
Applicant provided  information  showing  that,  as of December 9,  2020, he  owed  $28,451
for unpaid taxes in the  2014  through  2018  tax  years. The  same  information  shows that,
as of  August  4, 2021, he  owed  $19,022  in  unpaid taxes for the  2016, 2017, and  2018  tax
years, the  2014  and  2015  tax  year debts having  been  satisfied.  In July  2015, Applicant
entered   into   a   repayment  agreement  with   the   IRS   to   make  $151  monthly   payments to
resolve   his tax   debt.   That  repayment agreement  subsequently   has  been   renewed   and
adjusted   to   reflect   either  subsequent   late   filings  or  additional  requests  to   pay   through
installments  or  both.  His  monthly   payments   were  increased   with   each   renewal,  first  to
$191, then  to  $250.  He now  pays $350  each  month. His tax  debts also  have  been  reduced
through  involuntary  diversion  of  any  tax  refunds he  was due  after filing. (Answer; GX  2;
AX A  –  J, AX L; Tr. 66  –  78, 92)
Applicant asserts that he  was late in filing some of his federal and state returns
starting in 2013 because he found himself owing additional taxes as a result of increased
income from working overseas. He was not trying to avoid paying taxes but was confused
about how he should file his returns given his unexpected payment obligation even though
his 2013 filing requirements were no different than his filing requirements when he worked
overseas  the  previous  ten  years.  He  also  claims  he  did  not  know  how  to  change  his
income tax withholdings to avoid having to pay additional taxes after filing, and he has
acknowledged that he did not properly manage his finances until recently. Nonetheless,
as  discussed  above,  after  filing  his  2013  returns,  he  started  resolving  his  filing
discrepancies  and  established  a  repayment  plan.  He  also  started  using  a  private  tax
preparer who helped him file his returns for the 2018, 2019, and 2020 tax years. Applicant
is now current on all of his tax reporting obligations, and his tax preparer has helped him
adjust  his  income  tax  withholdings  to  a  level  appropriate  for  his  income  so  that  he  is
having sufficient tax withheld from his pay throughout the year. (Answer; GX 2; AX F; AX
J; AX L; Tr. 43 – 44, 49 – 52, 60 – 66, 81, 85 – 87)
Applicant’s  current  finances  are  otherwise  sound.  He  has  no  other  outstanding
debts,  and  he  brings  home  in  excess  of  $10,000  each  month  after  taxes  and  other
deductions.  He  estimates  that,  after  expenses,  he  has  about  $2,500  remaining  each
month, funds which he invests in a portfolio worth about $400,000. He acknowledged at
his hearing that he has the means with which to resolve his current tax debt. He prefers
not to do so, explaining that he is “kind of okay with [paying the IRS] $370 a month.” (Tr.
53 – 59, 94 – 96)
Applicant  has  an  excellent  reputation  in  the  workplace  and  his  community.
Associates who have known and worked with him for most of the past 25 years, and who
are aware of his tax problems, praise Applicant for his honesty, integrity, trustworthiness,
and professionalism. (AX K)
