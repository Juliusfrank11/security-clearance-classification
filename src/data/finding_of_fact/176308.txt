Applicant  is  a  58-year-old  engineer  working  for  a  defense  contractor.  He  has
worked for his current employer since 1998. He served in the U.S. military or the military
reserve from 1984 to 1997.  He served about eight years on active  duty.  All periods of
service  ended  with  an  honorable  discharge.  He  seeks  to  retain  a  security  clearance,
which  he  has  held  since  his  time  in  the  military.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree  that  he
earned  in  1993.  He  has  never  married,  and  he  has  no  children.  (Tr.  at  9-11,  30;

Applicant did not file his federal and state income tax returns when they were due
for tax years 1996 through 2006 and 2009 through 2018. He filed his federal and state
income tax returns for 2007 and 2008 on time. He received federal refunds of $2,724 for
2007 and $2,573 for 2008. (Tr. at 12, 20-21, 24-27; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2,
3)
Applicant  stated   that  he   did  not  realize   that   he   had   to   file   the   returns  if   he   was
due   refunds.  Since   he   had   more  than   enough   withheld  from   his  paychecks  to   pay   his
taxes, he  incorrectly  believed  he  was not  required  to  file  the  returns.  He  planned  to  file
the  returns and  receive the  refunds, but he  just never got around  to  it. (Tr. at 12-13, 22-
26, 36; Applicant’s response to SOR;  GE 2, 3)
Applicant  used  to  file  his  own  returns.  He  realized  it  was  easier  to  put  it  in  the
hands  of  a  professional,  and  he  retained  the  services  of  a  tax  professional to  prepare
the returns. He filed his federal and state income tax returns for 2017 in January 2019.
He  filed  the  2009  through  2018  returns  in  January  and  February  2020.  The  IRS
received his 2006 return in September 2020. He was due federal refunds each year, in
amounts  ranging  from  $1,242  to  $3,673.  Because  the  IRS  does  not  pay  refunds  from
returns  more  three  years  old,  Applicant  forfeited  almost  $18,000  in  federal  refunds  for
tax years 2006  and 2009 through 2015. He stated that he forfeited at least $10,000 in
refunds  from  his  state  during  the  same  period.  The  IRS  would  not  provide W-2s  from
before 2010, and Applicant no longer had information for tax years before 2006.  (Tr. at
15-19, 32-34; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2; AE C, D, J)
With  the assistance  of the tax professional,  Applicant filed his federal and  state
income tax returns for 2019, 2020, and 2021 on time.  He received refunds each year.
His state certified that he is in good standing. (Tr. at 33-34; GE 2; AE C, D, H-J)
Applicant accepted responsibility for his tax failures and poor judgment. He has a
good  job  with  a  stable  income.  He  completed  a  financial  counseling  course.  His
finances are currently in good shape, and he is aware that neglecting his tax obligations
in the future could jeopardize his security clearance and his job. He found the process
of  using a  tax professional easy,  and  he  is no  longer forfeiting thousands  of  dollars in
refunds.  He  credibly  stated  that  he  has  learned  a  valuable  and  costly  lesson,  and  all
future  tax  returns  will  be  filed  on  time.  (Tr.  at  17-19,  32-35;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 3, 4; AE G)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
January 2018. He did not report his failure to file federal and state tax returns under the
question that asked: “In the last seven (7) years have you failed to file or pay Federal,
state,  or  other  taxes  when  required  by  law  or  ordinance?”  He  credibly  denied
intentionally providing false information. As addressed above, he did not realize that he
was required to file tax returns if he was due refunds. Therefore, he thought he provided
the  correct  answer.  He  discussed  his  tax  situation  during  his  background  interview  in
January 2019. (Tr. at 17-18, 28, 31-32, 36; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 3) After
considering  all  of  the  evidence,  including  Applicant’s  age,  education,  experience,  and
credible testimony, I find he did not intentionally falsify the SF 86.
Applicant called a witness, and he  submitted documents and letters attesting to
his  moral  character  and  excellent  job  performance.  He  is  praised  for  his  honesty,
trustworthiness,  judgment,  dedication,  work  ethic,  and  diligent  handling  of  classified
information. (Tr. at 36-43; GE 2; AE A, E, L)
