Applicant is 57 years old. She has never married and has no children. She received
a high school diploma in 1982 and has taken some college courses. She also received a
professional  certification  in  2004.  Applicant  has  worked  for  several  U.S.  Government
contractors  as  a  technology  specialist  since  at  least  2007  and  has  held  a  security
clearance  on and off  since 1997.  Applicant  began working for  her  current employer,  a
defense  contractor,  in  March  2021.  She  is  seeking  to  continue  her  current  security
clearance in relation to her work with her employer. (Tr. at 16-19, 32; GE 1 at 9-10; GE 2
at 5; AE A at 3.)
Paragraph  1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for  clearance  because  she
failed to file her Federal (SOR 1.a) and state (SOR 1.b) income tax returns as required
for tax years (TYs) 2015 through 2019. As a result, the Government made a preliminary
conclusion that Applicant is potentially unreliable and untrustworthy and presents a risk
that she will not follow the Government’s rules and regulations. In her Answer, Applicant
admitted both allegations.
Applicant  has  a  history  of  non-compliance  with  the  Federal  and  state  tax-filing
deadlines. She did not file her tax returns for TYs 2009 and 2010 as required. She filed
within the three-year Federal statutory deadline to avoid forfeiture of her tax refunds for
those years. The SOR did not allege these facts. In about May 2011, the U.S. Department
of State granted Applicant national security eligibility at the Top Secret level. Applicant
then timely filed her returns as required for TYs 2011 through 2014. She received refunds
each  year.  For  many  years,  Applicant  has  claimed  zero  exemptions  on  her  W-4  tax
withholding  form,  including  the  tax  years  that  are  the  subject  of  the  SOR  allegations
(2015-2019).  She  believed  that  her  level  of  withholding  resulted  in  the  payment  of
sufficient  taxes  to  ensure  that  she  overpaid  her  Federal  income  tax  liability  in  each  of
those years and that she would not be penalized for filing her returns after their due date.
(Tr. at 34; GE 1 at 35.)
The current status of the matters alleged in the SOR is as follows:
1.a. Failure to timely  file Federal tax returns for TY2015  through TY2019 as
required. At the hearing, Applicant claimed that she misunderstood the tax-filing deadline
because she was complying with the three-year restriction for eligibility to receive a refund
of her overpaid taxes. She filed her TYs 2015 and 2016 Federal tax returns on February
9, 2018, which was in time to receive Federal refunds for those years. In her September
2017 e-QIP, she responded to a question in Section 26 by writing:
I have  been late on  filing for my federal  refund for FY  2015  and  2016. I am
not required to file  my [State 1] taxes, since I always am  due  a refund. I will
make sure  that both FY 2015 and FY 2016 are filed by the extension  date
of October 15, 2017. (GE 1  at 36.)
As  noted, she actually filed her  TYs 2015 and  2016  returns on  February 9,  2018, about
four months after  the October 15, 2017  date provided in  her e-QIP. According  to the tax
transcripts in  the record for those  two tax  years, Applicant  had  not  filed for  an extension
in   either   year.   She  believes   that  the  IRS  extension   request  form   states   that  it  is
unnecessary to  file  for an extension if that taxpayer is due  a refund;  however, she did not
provide   any  documentation  in  support   of  her  belief.  She   testified  that   she   now
understands  that she needed  to file  her returns by April 15th  of the following year.  (Tr.  at
36-37, 39-40; GE 4 at 55-56; AE G at 2-3.)
In  her  July  8,  2021  Answer,  Applicant  wrote  that  “after  going  through  my
adjudication in February 2020 [the month and year when the SOR was issued] . . . I filed
my Federal and [State 1] tax returns for tax year 2019 . . . [and] I filed Federal tax returns
from [sic] 2017 and 2018 (via mail).” She did not provide copies of those returns with her
Answer, but she provided a copy of her TY 2020 Federal tax return.
In response to interrogatories from the CAF in 2020, Applicant submitted a number
of documents with a cover note, dated September 8, 2020. In her note, she wrote that on
July 15, 2020, she filed her Federal tax returns for TYs 2017, 2018, and 2019, but that
IRS  Tax  Account  Transcripts  for  those  years  were  unavailable  due  to  COVID-related
delays at the IRS. Instead, she provided copies of her Federal tax returns for those years,
which  were  undated.  After  the  hearing,  Applicant  provided  an  IRS  Wage  and  Income
Transcript for TY 2017. That type of IRS transcript does not reflect the tax return filing
date and whether an extension was requested. At the hearing, Applicant claimed that on
or before April 15, 2020, she filed for an extension to file her 2019 tax return within six
months after the April 15, 2020 due date, and that she would provide evidence of that
extension  in  a  post-hearing  submission.  Her  post-hearing  submission  did  not  include
evidence  of  an  extension  for  TY  2019.  Her  submission  also  included  an  IRS  Account
Transcript,  which reflects  that  her  2020 Federal tax return  was  filed on May  17,  2021,
which  was  timely  under  the  IRS’s  COVID-related  automatic  extension  in  that  year.  In
summary, Applicant failed to timely file her Federal tax returns for TYs 2015 through 2019
as required. (Tr. at 42-43; GE 3 at 2; AE G at 4-12.)
1.b.   Failure  to  file  state  income  tax  returns  for  TY2015   through  TY2019  as
required. In her Answer, Applicant admitted that she failed to file her state tax returns for
the years alleged in the SOR. She wrote that she was not obligated to file tax years in
State 1 if she was owed a refund. Applicant provided the same comment in her e-QIP. In
her Answer she quoted from a page of the website of State 1 that provided information
regarding tax rules. The quote states: “You are not required to file if you do not owe any
taxes and will not receive a refund.” Department Counsel entered into evidence a page
from what appears to be the same website page, which contains the language Applicant
quoted  in  her  Answer  (GE  5).  That  exhibit  states  further  that  a  taxpayer  “must  file  an
income tax return in [State 1] if . . .you have [State 1] adjusted gross income equal to or
greater  that  the  [following]  amounts:  Filing  Status  –  Single  or  married  filing  separately
Income Threshold - $11,950.” Applicant’s adjusted gross income in [State 1] in each tax
year  alleged  in  the  SOR  substantially  exceeded  that  threshold.  These  instructions  are
contradictory when applied to Applicant’s situation. She never sought a clarification of her
tax-filing obligation. After receiving the CAF’s interrogatories in 2020, she filed her State
1 tax returns for TYs 2015 through 2019. The record is unclear if she filed her state tax
returns on July 15, 2020, with her Federal tax returns for TYs 2017 through 2019 or on
another date. (Answer at 1, 4, 7-14; Tr. at 23; GE 4 at 58-74; GE 1 at 36; GE 3 at 2, 5;
GE 5.)
Applicant’s state tax returns for TYs 2015 through 2019 reflect that she was due
to receive small refunds in each tax year except in TY 2019, when she owed $5. There is
no documentation in the record showing that she filed her state tax return for TY 2019 by
the filing deadline of May 1, 2020 or that she sought an extension to file after that date.
(Answer at 13-14.)
Mitigation
Applicant has been in continuous therapy with the same therapist since 2001. In
September  2013,  Applicant  experienced  serious  vicarious  trauma  at  the  time  of  the
shooting  at  her  worksite  at  the  Navy  Yard  in  Washington,  DC.  Several  of  her  close
colleagues  were  shot  and  killed  in  that  incident.  She  was  scheduled  to  be  with  those
individuals at that time, but a locked conference room door caused her to go elsewhere
prior to the shooting. Her colleagues stayed behind and became victims of the shooter.
Applicant  suffered  from  “survivor’s  guilt.”  As  a  result  of  this  incident,  her  “executive
functioning  skills”  were  not  as  good  as  they  needed  to  be.  She  entered  an  “emotional
trauma” program to help her recover from that experience. In late 2016, she also began
consulting  with  a  psychiatrist  who  diagnosed  Applicant  as  suffering  from  severe
depression. The psychiatrist prescribed medication for depression, and continues to the
present to manage her medication. Applicant described her depression as having been a
“progressive” problem, meaning that it worsened over time, until she received medication.
(Tr. at 24-26.)
Applicant is a recovering alcoholic and was a frequent drug user in her youth. She
has  been  sober  for  about  32  years.  She  remains  active  in  Alcoholics  Anonymous  and
works  with  her  sponsor.  Both  of  Applicant’s  parents  died  in  the  past  two  years.  Her
therapist wrote in a letter in the record that Applicant “manages her depression, and she
reaches out for help when she needs more support to manage her depression.” Applicant
described her current mental health at the hearing as “wonderful” though she is grieving
the loss of her parents, with whom she was very close. (Tr. at 24-26, 29; AE A at 1.)
A senior U.S. Government IT official and a long-time friend of Applicant’s wrote a
very positive character reference letter in support of Applicant maintaining her security
clearance. The friend acknowledged Applicant’s failure to file tax returns and attributed
her  actions  to  a  misunderstanding  by  Applicant  of  her  tax-filing  responsibilities.
Applicant’s  current  supervisor  also  wrote  a  supportive  character  letter.  At  the  hearing,
Applicant  described  her  performance  reviews  as  consistently  rating  her  as  “exceeds
expectations.” (Tr. at 27; AE A at 2-3.)
Applicant is financially secure and is capable of meeting any financial liability she
encounters.  She  has  significant  liquid  assets  and  minimal  personal  debts,  mainly  a
relatively small mortgage on her residence. She testified that her liquid assets are for the
most part from her inheritance from her father’s estate. Prior to his death, she said she
was less secure financially although her annual income over the past decade has been
well  in  excess  of  $100,000;  except  in  2017,  when  she  experienced  a  period  of
unemployment. Due to the need to file  estate tax  returns for  her father’s estate as the
executrix of the estate, Applicant is now working with a CPA. The CPA recently helped
her  submit  an  extension  for  the  filing  of  her  2021  Federal  tax  returns,  which  was
necessary due to her father’s death in 2021. (Answer at 15; Tr. at 46; GE 4 at 24, 35, 45,
54-58, 63, 67-68, 71; AE E.)
