In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations,  with  explanations,
except for SOR ¶ 1.h, which he denied. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact.
After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of
fact.
Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a federal contractor performing the duties
of a laboratory technician. He began working at his present job in May 2019. He served
in the Marine Corps from 2011-2016 as a radio technician and he received an honorable
discharge.  He  now  serves  in  his  state’s  National  Guard  (NG).  He  joined  the  NG  in
November  2018  as  a  helicopter  mechanic.  He  deployed  with  his  NG  unit  in  2021.  He
holds a bachelor’s degree. He is married and has six children, including two step-children.
Three of the children still reside with him and his wife. (Tr. 6, 17-18, 22, 30; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  eight  delinquent  accounts  (two  debts  arising  from repossessed
cars, a  debt  from  an  unexpired  lease, four telecommunications  debts,  and  a  medical debt)
totaling   approximately   $40,200.  The   debts   are  established   by   credit  reports  from
September  2019  and  December  2020; Applicant’s personal subject interview  (PSI) with
an  investigator in  September  2019;  and  his SOR admissions.  (SOR ¶¶  1.a  –  1.h)  (GE  2-
4; Answer to  SOR)
Applicant’s  financial  difficulties  began  after  he  was  discharged  from  the  Marine
Corps in 2016. He was attending school, taking short-term jobs, and using his G.I. Bill
benefits to support his family. During this time, his wife was unable to work because she
cared for their young children. As a result, Applicant got behind on his debts. (GE 2)
The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
SOR ¶  1.a-$17,186.  This debt resulted from the deficiency balance owed after the
repossession  and  sale  of  Applicant’s  car.  His  last  payment  was  in  2015,  and  it  was
repossessed in 2017. Applicant recently contacted the creditor about payment terms and
was told the creditor would settle the debt for approximately $7,819 paid over 24 months
with  a  monthly  payment  of  approximately  $325.  Appellant  did  not  provide  any
documentation showing that he accepted the plan or that he made any payments under
a plan. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 23, 25; GE 2-3; AE B)
SOR ¶  1.b-$13,875.  This debt resulted from the deficiency balance owed after the
repossession  and  sale  of  another  of  Applicant’s  cars.  His  last  payment  was  in  2017.
Applicant recently contacted the creditor about payment terms and was told the creditor
would settle the debt for approximately $11,484 with monthly payments of $20. Appellant
did not provide any documentation showing that he accepted the plan or that he made
any payments under a plan. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 26; GE 2-3; AE B)
SOR ¶ 1.c-$5,554.  Applicant incurred this unexpired-lease debt when he vacated
an  apartment  before  the  lease  was  up  in  2016  because  he  could  not  avoid  the  rent
amount. Applicant recently contacted the creditor about payment terms and was told the
creditor would accept three equal payments of approximately $1,851 to resolve the debt.
Appellant  did  not  provide  any  documentation  showing  that  he  accepted  the  creditor’s
proposal or that he made any payments. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 29-30; GE 2-3; SOR
answer; AE B)
SOR ¶¶  1.d-$879. Applicant admitted this telecommunications debt. He claimed
he gave his wife a debit card to pay this bill, but she used the card for other things. The
debt  was  turned  over  to  a  collection  agency  in  2016.  He  claims  there  is  no  longer  a
balance on this account, but he failed to present documentation showing payment. (GE
2-3; SOR answer; AE B)
SOR  ¶   1.e-$155.   Applicant  admitted
telecommunications  debt.  He
documented paying this debt in full on January 20, 2021. He had not made any payments
on the account previously. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 28; GE 2-3; SOR answer, AE B-C)
this
SOR ¶  1.f-$979.  Applicant admitted this telecommunications debt. He claimed that
the creditor offered to allow him to make five payments on the debt, or to pay a one-time
lesser settlement amount. He failed to present documentation that he took advantage of
either option. This debt is unresolved. (GE 2-3; SOR answer; AE B)
SOR  ¶   1.g-$1,539.   Applicant  admitted  this  telecommunications  debt.  He
documented making one payment of $235 on February 17, 2021, and a second payment
of $540 on March 1, 2021. He did not document any agreement reached with the creditor
concerning a settlement, or an acknowledgement from the creditor that the two payments
made settled the debt. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 28; GE 2-3; SOR answer, AE B, D)
SOR ¶  1.h-$125.  Applicant denied this medical debt. Applicant documented paying
this debt in full on January 21, 2021. This debt is resolved. (GE 3; SOR answer; AE B, E)
Applicant testified that his annual income is approximately $56,000 and that his
wife’s  current  income  is  between  $60,000  and  $70,000  annually.  He  and  his  family
currently  reside  with  his  in-laws,  but  they  are  trying  to  purchase  a  home  using  his
Department of Veterans Affairs benefits. He typically has approximately $100 to $200 left
over at the end of the month after paying all his bills. He has approximately $11,000 in
his retirement account. He admitted that he currently lives paycheck to paycheck. He has
received financial counseling through the NG. (Tr. 27, 30-34, 43)
Applicant’s  current  supervisor  wrote  a  letter  supporting  him  stating  that  he  is
trustworthy, reliable, and hard working. His supervisor also recommended that Applicant
retain his security clearance. (AE F)
