substance abuse class. (Tr. at 25-28; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3)
Applicant was arrested in September 2018 and charged with OWI. He refused a
breathalyzer. He pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to what he described as
underage  driving under the  influence.  He  could  not  explain  why a  person  in their later

a fine and take a traffic safety course. (Tr. at 17, 29-34; Applicant’s response  to  SOR;
