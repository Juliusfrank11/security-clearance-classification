Applicant  is 35  years old,  has  been married since  December 2012,  and  has  no
children. She has attended college for a number of years, as discussed below, but she
does not have a degree. Applicant has worked as an administrative programs assistant
for her current employer, a Defense contractor, since September 2017. This is her first
security clearance application. (Item 3; Item 4)
The SOR alleged that Applicant has two delinquent private student loans, totaling
$136,575. In her response to the SOR, she admitted both allegations, but she claimed
that: both accounts had been charged off; the creditor illegally placed both accounts in
default status when her co-signer passed away in 2014; the creditor is barred by a four-
year statute of limitations (SOL); and the debts no longer appear on her credit report. The
debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  were  confirmed  by  Applicant’s  credit  bureau  reports  (CBR)
dated August 2019 and January 2020. (Item 2; Item 5 at 9; Item 6 at 1-2)
Applicant started attending college before 2007, in State A, and she continued to
live and attend college in State A until 2012, when she moved to State B. She took online
courses  from  2015  until  2018,  when  she  was  in  a  car  accident.  She  resumed  taking
courses  in  September  2019.  (Department  Counsel’s  memo  states  Applicant  started
attended college courses in State A in August 2000, and attended courses continuously,
at three different institutions until September 2012. Applicant’s SCA, that she completed
in September 2019, asked her to disclose her education history dating back ten years.
She  disclosed  attending  two  secondary  institutions  in  State  A,  from  September  2008
through September 2012, and her secondary schooling in State B.) (Item 2; Item 3; Item
4)
In  her  2019  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  that  her  private  student  loans,  totaling
$136,576, had been charged off by her creditor after “they forced [her] into default [status]
in 2014 when they found out [her] grandmother was dying.” According to Applicant, the
SOL applied to these loans, it had passed, and there was a pending lawsuit against the
creditor on behalf of borrowers like her. (Item 3 at 57)
When Applicant was interviewed by a Government investigator in October 2019,
she was questioned regarding the status of her private and federal student loans. She
disclosed that in 2014, she was unemployed, and her grandmother was sick; therefore,
she was unable to make payments toward her private student loans. The student loan
creditor did not offer her any payment plans; the accounts were placed in default status;
and the balance on both loans were immediately due. Additionally, she claimed that the
SOL applied to these loans; she did not have to pay the loans; she did not intend to make
any payments; and she had never made any payments to either of the loans. (Item 4 at
2)
Applicant was living in State A when she opened the student loans alleged in the
SOR.  According  to  Applicant’s  August  2019  CBR,  the $47,437  student loan  alleged  in
SOR ¶ 1.a, was “assigned” or opened in September 2007, and the $89,138 student loan
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b was “assigned” or opened in January 2007. The last activity date
for both accounts is listed as August 2019, and they were both charged off. Applicant’s
January  2020  CBR,  gives consist  dates that  the  accounts  were opened, but indicates  that
the   last  date   of  activity   for  both   accounts   was  August  2013.   An   October  2019   loan
statement indicates  that Applicant’s  private  student loan  creditor was actively  attempting
to  collect $1,224.05  collectively  for both  student loans. (Item  5  at 9; Item  6  at 1-2; Item  7)
In  her  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  reiterated  that  she  believed  her  private
student loan debts were no longer valid due to a four-year SOL and her creditor’s illegal
behavior.  She  provided  no  corroborating  documentation  to  support  these  assertions.
(Item 2) The SOL for private student loans in State A is ten years, and the SOL for private
student loans in State B is four years. There is no evidence in the record that Applicant
resided in State B prior to 2012, and the loans alleged in the SOR were incurred in 2007.
According  to  her  2019  SCA,  Applicant  was  unemployed  during  the  following
periods:  December  2012  to  April  2013  (after  she  moved  to  State  B);  July  2013  to
December 2014 (she indicated that she resigned from a position in July 2013 for another
position  with  a  raise  but  was  then  unemployed  for  18  months);  and  July  2017  to
September 2017. (Item 3)
Applicant traveled  extensively  after she  married  her husband  in  December 2012.
She  took the  following foreign  trips: Egypt,  March 2014  (6-10  days); France, March 2014
(1-5   days);  Mexico,   November  2016   (1-5   days);  France,  April  2017   (1-5   days);  United
Kingdom, April 2017  (1-5  days); Italy, April –  May  2017  (6-10  days); China, December
2017  (1-5  days); India,  December 2017  (1-5  days); Mexico,  January  –  February  2018  (6-
10   days);  Mexico,   July   2018   (1-5   days);  United   Arab   Emirates,  December  2018   (1-5
days); Jordan, December 2018  (1-5  days); Japan, March  2019  (1-5  days); South  Korea,
March 2019  (1-5  days); Thailand, March 2010  (1-5  days); and  China, March 2019  (1-5
days). (Item  3; Item 4)
