Applicant is a 51-year-old civilian employee of a defense contractor who seeks a
security clearance. The admitted  allegations are incorporated  and adopted as relevant
and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant married in  December 1992  and divorced in  September 2006.  (Item 3)
He  has  no  children  from  this marriage.  He  remarried  in  October 2017  and  divorced  in
April  2018.  (Item  3)  He  has  no  children  from  this  marriage.  (Item  3)  Applicant  earned
technical certifications in December 1994 and September 2000. (Item 3) He reported no
military service.
Since January 2012, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as a
technical architect. (Item 3) Previously, he worked for other employers in various types
of technical positions. Applicant has never held a security clearance. (Item 3)
Applicant’s  finances
Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax year
2013.  (Item  4)  His  interrogatory  responses  and  incorporated  IRS  tax  transcript  for  tax
year  2013  document  that  he  didn’t  file  either  his  federal  or  state  tax  return  until
November 2016, well after the expirations of any obtained filing extensions. (Item 4) Tax
records  document  that  he  is  indebted  to  the  Federal  Government  for  delinquent  taxes
owed for tax year 2018 in the amount of $1,908 (inclusive of interest and penalties) as
of  August  2020.  (Item  4)  His  tax  account  transcripts  for  tax  years  2014-2018  confirm
that any tax refunds owed to Applicant for these years were redirected  to satisfy taxes
owed for his earlier IRS tax years. (Item 4) To date, Applicant has provided no evidence
of his addressing his delinquent federal taxes owed for tax year 2018.
Besides   his  2018   federal  tax   debt,  Applicant  accumulated   four  delinquent
consumer debts exceeding  $39,000  between  2012  and  2020.  (Items 3-7) Credit  reports
reveal  no   efforts  on   Applicant’s  part  to   address  these   debts   (covered   by   SOR  ¶¶   1.c-
1.f).
In  May  2013,  Applicant  filed  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  relief.  (Items  3-7).  He
reportedly scheduled $19,000 in debts. (Item 4) Of these scheduled debts, his primary
debt  of  concern  was  a  mortgage  debt  on  his  home.  (Item  4)  Once  he  was  able  to
arrange new payment terms with his lender, he simply stopped paying the trustee on his
agreed plan payments. Applicant’s Chapter 13 petition was thereafter dismissed in July
2013  for  lapses  in  approved  plan  payments.  (Item  4)  Some  of  the  accounts  that  are
covered  by  the  SOR  were  included  in  Applicant’s  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  petition.
Applicant’s  assigned  reason  for  accumulating  his  delinquent  debts  was  his  prioritizing
his  needs  to  provide  financial  assistance  to  his  family  members  over  his  taking
responsibility for paying his debts in a timely manner and keeping his finances in sound
working order.  (Item 4)
Since  January  2012,  Applicant  has  been  employed  consistently  by  his  current
employer without any reported interruptions in his work schedules. To date, he has not
made any documented progress in addressing his delinquent federal tax and consumer
debts. Afforded an opportunity to supplement the FORM with updated information about
addressing his debts, he failed to do so.
Because there is a lack of documented information from Applicant in the record
to assess his reported delinquent tax and consumer accounts, no favorable inferences
can be drawn as to whether he will be able to resolve his SOR-listed debt delinquencies
in the foreseeable future. Based on his untimely filing of his 2013 federal and state tax
returns and the absence of sufficient evidence of addressing his SOR-listed delinquent
accounts,  Applicant’s  prospects  for  resolving  his  debt  delinquencies  are  uncertain  at
best.
