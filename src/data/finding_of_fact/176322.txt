Applicant  is  a  37-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  where  he  has
worked  since  January  2020.  He  has  two  associate’s  degrees  that  he  earned  in  2006
and a bachelor’s degree that he earned in 2010. He has never married, and he has no
children. (Tr. at 12-13, 30; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1)
Applicant  has  a   history   of  financial  problems,  which  he   attributed   to   periods  of
unemployment  and  underemployment. (Tr.  at 28-41,  45; Applicant’s response   to   SOR;
GE  1) The  SOR  alleges nine  delinquent  debts totaling  about  $61,660. The debts include
a payday  loan  (SOR ¶ 1.a  - $587), three  defaulted student loans  (SOR ¶¶ 1.b  - $21,609;
1.c - $15,211;  and  1.f - $11,909), the  deficiency  balances owed  on  two  auto  loans  after
one  vehicle  was stolen, and  the other vehicles was repossessed and  sold  (SOR ¶¶  1.d  -
$1,731  and  1.e  - $9,246), and  three  miscellaneous accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.g  - $480; 1.h  -
$431; and  1.f  - $457).  Applicant owed  all  of  the  debts at one  time,  but  all  but  two  have
been paid or settled. Specific debts are addressed below.
Applicant paid the delinquent $587 payday loan (SOR ¶ 1.a) in November 2020.
He settled the $1,731 deficiency balance owed on an auto loan  (SOR ¶ 1.d) for $596,
with  the  payment  made  in  November  2020.  He  settled  the  $9,246  deficiency  balance
owed  on  an  auto  loan  (SOR  ¶  1.e)  for  $4,500,  with  payments  completed  by  February
2021. (Applicant’s response to SOR; AE A, E, I)
Applicant settled the $11,909 defaulted student loan  (SOR ¶ 1.f) for $5,000. He
paid  $2,500  in  November  2020  and  another  $2,500  in  January  2021  as  settlement  in
full. He settled the $480 loan (SOR ¶ 1.g) for $300, which was paid in November 2020.
He settled the $431 and $457 debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i) to the same credit union for
$877, with the payment in November 2021. (Applicant’s response to SOR; AE B, D, F)
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c allege $21,609 and $15,2118 defaulted student loans owed
to  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education.  Applicant  asserted  that  he  unsuccessfully
attempted  to  defer  the  loans  or  have  them  placed  in  forbearance  when  he  was
unemployed. He stated that his paychecks were eventually garnished, and his income
tax refunds were seized for the loans. He established a $5 per month payment plan, but
he  said  that the  collections  branch failed  to keep track of  the payments.  (Tr. at  42-43;
Applicant’s response to SOR)
In  January  2020,  Applicant  applied  for  a  borrower  defense  discharge  of  his
federal student loans. (Tr. at 56; Applicant’s response  to  SOR; AE  C) He stated in his
response to the SOR:
Due  to  nefarious  actions  by  the  Department  of  Education,  which  was
issuing  blanket  denials  of  Borrower  Defense  applications  without
considering the claims, a law suit was filed and there is currently litigation
to  determine how  the processing  of  the Borrower Defense  Applications will
be treated by the Department of Education.
Documents provided by Applicant show the two  defaulted student loans alleged
in  the  SOR  and  two  additional  student  loans  that  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  The
principal owed on the four loans is $50,860 and the interest owed is $12,163, for a total
of $63,023. (Tr. at 49-51; AE G)
Applicant’s  student-loan  payment  records  show  seven  payments  of  $145
between October 2013 and July 2014, followed by monthly $5 payments from October
2014 through March 2015. However, the $5 payments in January, February, and March
2015  were  reversed.  Another  $5  payment  was  made  in  May  2015.  His  wages  were
garnished  a  total  of  $2,152  between  April  and  October  2016.  All  of  those  payments
were applied to interest and fees, with none going to the principal. (Tr. at 43, 46; AE H)
Applicant  resumed  making  $5  monthly  payments  in  December  2016,  which
continued  through  November  2017.  He  made  a  single  $5  payment  in  July  2018.  In
February 2019, $1,095 was withheld from his federal income tax refund and applied to
the loans. He made five payments of $5 between August and December 2019, however
two of those payments were reversed. He made a $100 payment in January 2022. (Tr.
at 46-48; AE H, K, L)
Applicant stated that he borrowed  about $37,000 in student loans, and he does
not understand how he now owes about $63,000. He did not appear to have a handle
on the concept of compound interest and how if more than the interest is not paid, the
loan can balloon to much more than what was borrowed. He admitted that he was “not a
math  guy.”  Even  though  he  does  not  completely  agree  with  the  amount  owed,  he
entered into a $463 per month payment agreement in January 2022.  He made a $465
payment in February 2022. He intends to honor the agreement. He realizes now that if
he does not start addressing the loans with payments going toward the principal, absent
action from the federal government or a favorable result from the lawsuit, the loans will
continue to grow. (Tr. at 50-68; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE K, L)
Applicant  paid  several  debts  that  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Applicant’s
January 2022  credit  report listed four accounts  that were  a  total of  $567 past due. He
owed  the  IRS  about  $1,200  for  tax  year  2019,  but  he  has  been  paying  the  IRS  and
reduced  the  amount  owed  to  about  $400.  He  acknowledged  that  he  made  some
financial mistakes, but he has learned valuable lessons. His finances are the best they
have been in years. He has a good job that pays  well. He plans to bring his  accounts
current  and  continue  to  pay his other accounts,  including his  taxes  and  student loans.
He has not received financial counseling. (Tr. at 69-79, 84; GE 2-4)
Applicant called a witness, and he submitted documents and letters attesting to
his excellent job performance and moral character. He is praised for his trustworthiness,
work ethic, honesty, reliability, loyalty, professionalism, competency, dependability, and
integrity. (Tr. at 22-27; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE J)
