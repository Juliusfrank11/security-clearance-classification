The  SOR alleges that,  as of  August 20, 2021, Applicant owed  six  charged-off  debts
totaling   $17,617   (SOR  ¶¶   1.a,  1.e-1.g,   and   1.i-1.j),  and   eight  collection   debts  totaling
$11,337   (SOR  ¶¶   1.b-1.d,  1.h,  and   1.k-1.n).  When   Applicant  answered   the   SOR,  he
admitted  the  alleged  accounts were delinquent but indicated  that  the  original  amount  of the
debt in SOR ¶  1.h  was $80  less than  the  amount alleged. He stated  that he  had  previously
made  payments on  the  debts in SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b; was on  payment plans for the  debts
in SOR ¶¶  1.c-1.d, 1.f, 1.h-1.i, and  1.k-1.l; and  had  paid off  the  debts in SOR ¶¶  1.m  and
1.n. He asserted  that once  the  debts in payment plans were resolved, he  would resume
payments on  the  debts in SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b, and  begin payments on  the  debts in SOR
¶¶  1.e, 1.g, and  1.j. I accept and  incorporate  as factual findings that Applicant incurred  the
delinquencies in the  amounts admitted  by him. After considering the  pleadings, exhibits,
and transcript, I make the  following  additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 35-year-old designer employed by a defense contractor since May
2005. (GE 1.) He has held a DOD security clearance for over 16 years with no security
violations. (Tr. 67.) He took classes at two local community colleges between May 2008
and May 2013, and he earned a certificate. (GE 1.)
Applicant and his ex-wife divorced in August 2017 after four plus years of marriage.
His ex-wife has primary residential custody of their two daughters, now age 6 and age 11.
(GE  1;  AE  A.)  Applicant  has  two  other  daughters,  age  2  and  age  7  months,  with  his
fiancée. They have had a cohabitant relationship since about October 2019. (Tr. 50, 54.)
In July 2013, Applicant purchased the home that he shared with his now ex-wife. He
obtained a first mortgage of $153,174 and a second mortgage of $12,345. He made his
mortgage payments on the primary loan through May 2017 and on the other loan through
June 2017. (GEs 3-4.) In July 2017, he and his ex-wife separated permanently, and he
moved in with his mother for about a month before renting an apartment. (GE 1.)
Applicant’s ex-wife was given the marital home in the divorce. (GE 1; AE A.) As of
August 2017, the monthly payment obligation on the first mortgage was $1,097. (GE 4.)
Applicant was required to pay the expenses of the property, including the mortgages, only
through June 30, 2017. Thereafter, his ex-wife was solely obligated to pay the mortgage
loans, taxes, insurance, maintenance, and utility expenses for the property. The court gave
her five years to refinance the property and obtain a mortgage in her name. Applicant was
to be removed from liability for any debt related to the property within five years of their
divorce. (AE A.) She made no payments on the mortgages. (GEs 3-4.) The house “went
under,” and  Applicant asserts he could do nothing about the situation, as he had been
required in the divorce to deed the property to his ex-wife, who abandoned the property.
(Tr. 26.) As of August 2017, the primary mortgage was listed as having a zero balance on
Applicant’s credit report after transfer. However, the second mortgage was still affecting his
credit.  As  of  November 2017,  that  mortgage  loan  was  $323  past  due on a balance of
$11,378. (GE 4.).
At the time of their divorce, Applicant and his ex-wife agreed that he would pay $291
per week in child support starting July 7, 2017, and that they each would pay half of the
cost of work-related or camp daycare and medical expenses for their children. Regarding
financial liabilities, Applicant and his ex-wife assumed responsibility for the debts incurred
separately or in their respective names. They agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the
other  from  any  liability  arising  for  the  failure  to  pay  a  debt,  and  to  terminate  any  joint
accounts. (AE A.)
Applicant had been current on his financial obligations before his divorce, (Tr. 39,
41.) He stopped paying on several of his consumer credit obligations in the summer of
2017  because  he  could  not  afford  to  pay  them  as  he  had  his  divorce  attorney’s  fees
totaling some $10,000; his child support payment; and his living expenses, which included
rent. (Tr. 36, 43.) His annual income in 2017 was less than $60,000. (Tr. 48.)
On November 30, 2017, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86) to renew his security clearance eligibility. He indicated on his SF 86 that
a credit management company was assisting him in eliminating all but one of his credit-
card  debts  (including  the  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  1.f-1.i,  and  1.l).  Under  a  section  for
additional comments, Applicant stated that his ex-wife was supposed to pay the mortgage
on the marital residence, but that it was continuing to adversely affect his credit and his
credit  score.  (GE  1.)  Applicant  now  discrepantly  recalls  that  he  contacted  the  credit
management company in late 2017 and that the company was handling only two or three
of his credit-card delinquencies, including the account in SOR ¶ 1.j. (Tr. 45.)
Applicant paid the credit management company $267 per month for several months
but less than one year before he terminated its service in October 2018 because he saw
no progress in the reduction of his debts. He believes the company was holding onto his
money until debts dropped from his credit report. (Tr. 44-47.) He began contacting his
creditors on his own to arrange for repayment. (Tr. 46.)
Several of Applicant’s accounts were delinquent by December 2017, including a
couple  of  debts  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  (GE  4.)  The  history  of  his  delinquency  and
repayment efforts for the SOR debts follows.
SOR ¶ 1.a — $9,990 charged-off account
An unsecured loan with a credit union, with a high credit of $11,785, was $298 past
due with a $9,882 balance as of November 2017. The loan was scheduled to be repaid at
$300 per month. (GE 4.) Applicant had taken out the loan to replace a couple of his now
ex-wife’s engines. He asserts that she was supposed to pay him half of the loan and never
did. (Tr. 42.) The account was charged off for $9,990 in July 2018 because of no payments
after March 2018. (GE 3.)
Applicant  made  four  $60  payments  toward  the  debt  in  June  2021  to  bring  the
balance of the debt to $9,735. (GE 2; AE A.) Applicant asserted in August 2021 that he
would resume repayment when the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.k, and 1.l were
paid off. (AE A.) On January 4, 2022, Applicant arranged to pay $10 a week toward the
debt  through  automatic  deductions  from  his  checking  account.  (AE  B.)  He  made  11
payments of $10 each between January 21, 2022, and April 1, 2022. (AE G.)
SOR ¶ 1.b — $3,184 collection account
Applicant became delinquent on his rent payment starting in June 2019. In October
2019, the creditor placed a past-due balance of $3,184 in collection. (GEs 2-3.) Applicant
made $67 weekly payments in June 2021 to reduce the balance of the debt to $3,117. (GE
2; AE A.) He asserted in August 2021 that he would resume payments when the debts in
SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.k, and 1.l were paid off. (AE A.) He made no further payments
on  the  collection  account  by  December  2021.  (GE  2.)  On  January  4,  2022,  Applicant
arranged  to  pay  $10  a  week  toward  the  debt  through  automatic  deductions  from  his
checking account. Payment records reflect he made $10 weekly payments from January
21,  2022,  through  April  1,  2022.  (AE  H.)  As  of  April  8,  2022,  the  debt  balance  was
$3,007.81. (AE P.)
SOR ¶ 1.c — $2,902 collection account
Applicant’s  credit-card  account  (#6032),  opened  in  October  2009,  became
delinquent in September 2017 for nonpayment after July 2017. As of December 2017, his
account was $561 past due on a balance of $2,891. (GE 4.) In February 2019, his account
was placed for collection  in the amount of $2,902.  (GE 3.) According to Applicant, the
creditor agreed to accept $2,000 in settlement payable at $41.50 per week. (AE A.) As of
November 2021, Equifax was reporting a debt balance of $2,034. (GE 2.) Payment records
show that he made $41.50 weekly payments to a collection entity from June 24, 2021,
through April 1, 2022. (AEs A, B, I.) The debt balance was $132.50 as of April 8, 2022. (AE
P.) After the debt is paid off in late April 2022, Applicant plans to put the money he was
paying to this creditor toward other debts. (Tr. 42.)
SOR ¶ 1.d — $2,305 collection account
Applicant stopped paying on a revolving charge account (#6879) opened in June
2010. As of December 2017, his account was $274 past due on a balance of $2,419. (GE
4.) In  May 2019,  his account  was  placed for collection with an  outstanding balance of
$2,305. (GE 3.) On June 18, 2021, he began making $23.11 monthly payments toward the
debt. (AE A.) As of  November 2021, he owed $2,103 on the debt.  (GE 2.) A payment
record reflects that he continued to make his monthly payments through March 21, 2022.
(AE J.)
SOR ¶ 1.e — $2,225 charged-off account
Applicant and a joint owner opened the credit-card account in September 2005. The
creditor charged off a $2,225 balance in July 2019 after two years of no payments. (GE 2.)
Applicant asserted in August 2021 that he would resume payments when the debts in SOR
¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.k, and 1.l were paid off. (AE A.) He has made no payments toward
the debt. (GE 2; AE P.)
SOR ¶ 1.f — $1,965 charged-off account
Applicant opened the credit-card account (#5178) in September 2015. His account
had a credit limit of $1,700. He made no payments on the account after July 2017, and the
creditor  charged  off  his  account  for  $2,083.  (GEs  2-4.)  After  a  June  2021  payment,
Applicant reportedly owed a balance of $1,880. (GE 2.) He asserted in August 2021 that he
was current on a payment plan under which he was making payments of between $30 and
$100 a month toward an outstanding balance of $1,775. (AE A.) He did not make any
payments after June 2021 until November 26, 2021, when he began making $15 weekly
payments to a collection entity. As of April 1, 2022, he had made 19 payments of $15 each.
(AE K.)
SOR ¶ 1.g — $1,245 charged-off account
Applicant’s  gasoline  credit-card  account  (#2116),  opened  in  August  2014,  was
reportedly past  due  for  $311  on  a  balance  of  $1,122  in  December  2017.  (GE  4.) The
account was closed in November 2017 and charged off for $1,245 around February 2018
because of nonpayment after June 2017. (GEs 2-3.) Applicant asserted in August 2021
that he would make payments when the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.k, and 1.l were
paid off. (AE A.)
Applicant provided evidence of $10 weekly payments starting January 24, 2022, to a
collection  entity  (AEs  B,  L),  which  he  indicates  were  made  on  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.g.
However, the evidence shows that the payments were made on a credit-card debt placed
with the collection entity by a home improvement retailer (debt not alleged in the SOR).
Available credit reports show that Applicant’s credit card (ending in #4281) with the home
improvement retailer, opened in December 2010, was $255 past due on a balance of $896
as of November 2017. (GE 4.) As of April 6, 2022, the collection entity was reporting a debt
balance of $898 on the debt placed by the home improvement retailer. (AE L.) It was not
clearly established  that  Applicant  has  made  any payments  on the gasoline credit-card
account in SOR ¶ 1.g. As of December 2021, the debt was on his credit record as $1,245
past due. (GE 2.)
SOR ¶ 1.h — $1,187 collection account
Applicant’s gasoline credit-card account (#7302), opened in August 2014, was 120
days or more past due in the amount of $294 on a $1,065 balance as of December 2017.
(GE. 4.) In October 2018, the creditor placed a $1,187 balance for collection. (GE 3.) As of
December 2021, Equifax was reporting a debt balance of only $71 on the debt. (GE 2.)
Applicant provided records showing that a judgment obtained by the collection entity was
satisfied as of December 20, 2021. (AE D.)
Applicant submitted in evidence checks showing $10 weekly payments from October
1, 2021, through April 1, 2022, to a collection entity to resolve an account. He asserts that
the payments are for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h (AEs E, F) to reduce the balance to $739.36 as
of April 8, 2022. (AE P.) It is unclear what debt is currently being addressed through those
payments. It may be a credit-card debt owed to a tire retailer, as Applicant asserted that he
is repaying that debt at $10 a month. (AE L.) His December 2017 credit report lists a credit-
card  account  with  a  tire  retailer  opened  in  March  2014  that  was  $401  past  due  on  a
balance of $1,268 as of December 2017. (GE 4.)
SOR ¶ 1.i — $1,140 charged-off account
Applicant’s credit-card account with the creditor (#5178), opened in February 2016,
was past due $242 on a balance of $1,334 as of December 2017. (GE 4.) The account was
charged off for $1,140. (GEs 3-4.) After an initial payment of $1 on July 9, 2021, Applicant
made  $30  payments  approximately  every  two  weeks  starting  on  July  23,  2021.  As  of
August 2021, he claimed a debt balance of $955. (AE A.) The debt was not on his credit
report as of December 2021. (GE 2.) As of April 5, 2022, the debt balance was $593.14.
(AE N.)
SOR ¶ 1.j —  $1,052 charged-off account
Applicant’s retail charge account, opened with the creditor in December 2013, was
past due for $207 on a balance of $882 as of December 2017. (GE 4.) His account was
charged  off  for  $1,052.  (GEs  2-3.)  He  asserted  in  August  2021  that  he  would  make
payments when the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.k, and 1.l were paid off. (AE A.)
As of December 2021, he had made no payments on the debt. (GE 2.)  On January 4,
2022, he arranged to make $10 weekly payments starting in January 2022. He provided
payment records showing 11 payments of $10 each between January 21, 2022, through
April 1, 2022. (AE M.) As of April 8, 2022, the debt balance was $942.38. (AE P.)
SOR ¶ 1.k — $776 collection account
Applicant’s  account  with  an  Internet  and  cable  services  provider  first  became
delinquent in July 2017. It was placed for collection in December 2019 for $776. (GE 2.) He
arranged to make $50 monthly payments. (AE A.) As of November 2021, the balance of
the debt was $726. (GE 2; AE A.) He made a payment on February 26, 2022 (Tr. 47),
which fully resolved the debt. (AE C.)
SOR ¶ 1.l — $492 collection account
Applicant made no payments after July 2017 on a Visa credit-card account (#4447)
opened by him in January 2016. As of December 2017, the account was $160 past due on
a balance of $773. (GE 4.) The account was charged off and sold or transferred in March
2018. As of March 2020, Applicant owed a balance of $492. (GE 3.) He began repaying
the debt at $35 per week on June 18, 2021. As of August 13, 2021, he had made eight
payments of $35 each. (AE A.)  He paid off the debt on December 20, 2021. (AE P.)
SOR ¶ 1.m — $392 collection account
As of March 2020, Applicant owed a collection balance of $392 to the same creditor
identified in SOR ¶ 1.k. (GE 3.) The credit entry on his credit report does not reflect an
account number for the debt. Applicant paid off the debt on June 18, 2021. (AE A; Tr. 28.)
The debt was not on his December 2021 credit report. (GE 2.)
SOR ¶ 1.n — $99 collection account
Applicant’s account with a telecommunications company was in collection for $99 as
of March 2020. (GEs 2-3.) The debt was fully resolved with a final payment of $49 on June
18, 2021. (GE 2; AEs A, P; Tr. 28.)
Applicant’s annual income at work increased by $5,000 to $6,000 in 2018 and 2019.
(Tr. 49.) Despite the extra income, Applicant fell behind about $6,000 in his child support,
which he attributes to unexpected medical co-payment expenses. (Tr. 31.) In March 2019,
he was ordered to pay $457 per week ($291 for child support, $50 toward the arrearage,
and $116 for daycare) to his ex-wife. The payment was to be made by wage execution,
which he asserts was voluntary. Any payment five days late or more would result in a $50
weekly sanction fee. (AE A; Tr. 31-33, 38.) As of early February 2022, Applicant’s child
support arrearage was $1,826. On his petition, his child support was modified to $391 per
week ($291 in child support, $50 in childcare expenses, and $50 toward the arrearage).
(AE O.) The modification of Applicant’s child support obligation in February 2022 freed up
$66 per week to put towards his delinquent debts. (Tr. 30.) Applicant expects the child-
support arrearage to be paid off in August 2022. At that point, his child support obligation
will decrease by $50 to $341 per week, and he will have additional funds to pay down his
debts. (Tr. 31.)
Applicant had insufficient income withheld from his pay for tax years 2017 through
2020 to cover his federal income tax obligations. He could not pay the taxes owed when
they  were  due  because  of  his  child  support  obligation.  (Tr.  58-59.)  He  has  paid
approximately $70,000 total in child support and daycare costs for his two older daughters
since 2017. (Tr.44.) In the spring of 2021, he began making $25 monthly payments to the
IRS under an installment agreement to repay his delinquent federal income taxes for tax
years 2017 through 2020. The agreement was modified in March 2022 to increase his
monthly payment to $50. Some $1,100 of his $2,000 federal income tax refund for 2021
was  put  towards  his  federal  income  tax  delinquency,  which  reduced  his  income  tax
delinquency for tax years 2017 through 2020 to approximately $20,000. (Tr. 59-62.)
Applicant’s December 2021 credit report reflects that Applicant and a joint owner
obtained  an  unsecured  loan  of  $5,733  in  January  2021.  They  were  making  monthly
payments of $132 on time. Additionally, Applicant opened new credit-card accounts with
$300 credit limits in August 2020, September 2020, February 2021, and August 2021. As
of November 2021, the accounts were current with respective balances of $358, $342,
$268, and $279. An automobile loan, obtained by Applicant in May 2019 for $11,266, was
past due for $900 on a balance of $11,456 as of October 2021. He was not asked about
the reasons for his late payments or about a credit-card delinquency that he paid after his
account was charged off for $616. (GE 2.)
Applicant currently earns about $83,000 annually in his defense-contractor job. (Tr.
49.) He is repaying a $10,000 loan from his retirement account at work. He borrowed the
funds in 2016 to renovate the basement in his marital residence. The payment of $51.92 a
week comes directly out of his pay. (Tr. 57.)
Applicant, his fiancée, and their two young daughters live with his fiancée’s parents.
His fiancée works as a dental assistant. (Tr. 64.) Applicant did not provide any details
about her income. He pays her parents $200 for rent and contributes to other household
expenses, such as groceries. (Tr. 54-55.) He drives a 2013 model-year vehicle and has a
car payment of $176 a month. He took out the car loan in May 2015 for $16,655. Available
credit information reflects that he was chronically 30 days late in his car payments, but he
was never more than two payments past due. As of November 2021, his car loan was past
due one payment of $176. (GE 2.). Car insurance for him and his fiancée is $78 per week.
(Tr.  58.)  Daycare  for  their  two  daughters  is  $400  a  week.  (Tr.  64.)  Applicant  has  had
unexpected  expenses  for his two older daughters. He spent  $150 on clothes for them
during their recent stay with him. (Tr. 57.) Applicant has paid off his divorce attorney’s fees
(Tr. 36), but he did not provide any information about that amounts or dates of repayment.
