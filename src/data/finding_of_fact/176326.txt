Applicant is 51 years old, and he works on a computer interface system for a DOD
contractor. (Tr. 6; GE 1) In 1989, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 6, 8) In 2018, he
received a bachelor’s degree with a major in electrical engineering. (Tr. 6-7) He served in

Financial Considerations
Applicant’s  annual  salary  is  about  $74,000.  (Tr.  28)  He  receives  an  additional
$20,000 in Navy retirement benefits. (Tr. 28) His spouse is not employed outside their
home. (Tr. 29) He is able to pay his bills; however, he does not have excess funds for
savings and investments. (Tr. 29-30) He has about $25,000 in a Thrift Savings Plan and
a 401(k) account. (Tr. 30) Around 2019, Applicant’s spouse had medical problems, and

SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b allege and Applicant admitted that he failed to file his federal
and state income tax returns for tax years (TY) 2012 through 2019 as of the date of the
SOR,  March  26,  2021.  (HE  3)  He  failed  to  timely  file  his  tax  return  for  TY  2010.  In
subsequent  years,  he  believed  he  could  not  file  tax  returns  for  later  TYs  because  he
needed information from the previous tax return for the next tax return. (Tr. 18)  His tax
returns for TYs 2012 and 2013 were filed; however, his tax returns for TYs 2014 through
2019 were filed in June 2021. (Tr. 20, 21) Applicant said he electronically submitted his
tax returns for TY 2014 through 2019 in the December 2020 to January 2021 timeframe.
(Tr. 17, 22) He did not present a receipt or documentation for the electronic filing in the
December 2020 to January 2021 timeframe. (Tr. 23) About six months later, he contacted
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to check the status of taxes, and he learned the IRS
did  not  have  his  tax  returns  for  TYs  2014  through  2019.  (Tr.  23)  He  subsequently
resubmitted them electronically; then he checked with the IRS in September or October
of 2021; and he learned the IRS had not received his tax returns. (Tr. 23) He mailed paper
copies of his federal income tax returns for TYs 2014 through 2019 using certified mail.
(Tr. 17, 24) At the time of his hearing, he said he believed all of his federal income tax
returns were filed. (Tr. 19-20) He was aware of his tax-filing responsibilities, and he chose
not to take timely actions to file his tax returns because he was intimidated by the process
of getting his tax issues resolved. (Tr. 34) He said he was “hiding from [the] problem.” (Tr.
35)
The IRS tax transcript for TY 2016 indicates in July 2019, the IRS calculated his
taxes due; the balance  owed on November 23, 2020, was $10,506; and no payments,
other than monthly withholding from salary, are reflected on the tax transcript. (GE 2 at
21-22) The IRS tax transcript for TY 2017 indicates in March 2020, the IRS calculated his
taxes  due;  the  balance  owed  on  November  23,  2020,  was  $9,511;  and  no  payments,
other than monthly withholding from salary, are reflected on the tax transcript. (GE 2 at
25-26) The November 6, 2020 IRS tax transcripts for TYs 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2019
did not indicate any tax returns were filed, and the IRS did not calculate his tax liability for
those tax years.
Applicant acknowledged that he did not file his state tax returns for TYs 2014 to
2019. (Tr. 26) The state calculated his state taxes for several years, and garnished his
pay. (Tr. 26) He was unsure which TYs were calculated, filed, paid, or resolved. (Tr. 26)
SOR ¶¶  1.c and  1.d  allege   and Applicant admitted  that he  owes federal income
taxes of  $10,506  for TY  2016  and  $9,506  for TY  2017, respectively. (HE  3)  He estimated
that he  owed  the  IRS  between  $30,000  and  $50,000  for TYs 2014  through  2019. (Tr. 24-
25)  He tried  to  refinance  his house  previously; however, the  lender  would not loan  him
funds because  of  his tax  situation. (Tr. 33) He intends to  borrow  the  funds from  his mother
to  pay  his tax  debt,  and  then  he  intends  to  refinance  his  house  and  use  the  proceeds  to
repay  his mother. (Tr. 17)  He estimated  that  he  has about $100,000  of  equity  in his home.
(Tr. 25)
