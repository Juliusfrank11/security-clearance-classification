Financial Considerations
The SOR lists one allegation under this concern as a result of Applicant failing to
file  Federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2016,  2017,  and  2018.  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  This
allegation, which he admitted, is established by his July 15, 2019 SF-86; his August 23,
2019  Office  of  Personnel  Management  Personal  Subject  Interview  (OPM  PSI);  his
December 15, 2020 Response to DOHA Interrogatories; and his undated SOR Answer.
(GE 1 through 3; SOR Answer; Tr. 1 at 11)
SOR  ¶  1.a:  In  his SOR Answer,  Applicant  explained  his failure  to timely file  his
Federal income tax returns as follows:
During  my  employment at [previous employer] (Aug  2015  to  Feb  2019), I
elected  for maximum  allowances on  my  form  W4  beginning  in 2016. This
was due  to  a  misguided  concept to  allocate  the  otherwise withheld portion
of   my   paycheck  into   a   split  between   high   interest   yielding   account  and
securities for the   tax   year term. The   methodology   was  to   accrue   savings
and  investment interest on  the  earmarked  money, then  liquidate  and  pay
back  owed   taxes  to   the   IRS.   This  of   course   did  not  take   into   account
penalties  due   to   misrepresenting   W4   allowances,  risk  from   securities
investment,  taxed   owed   on   short  term   capital  gains,   and   of   course  the
financial ethics of   the  situation. This pattern occurred  from  2016  until the
end   of  my   employment  with   [previous  employer]  and   partially   into   my
employment  with   [current  employer]  (approximately   May   2019).  (SOR
Answer)
Applicant  further  stated  that  after  beginning  his  current  employment  that  it
became apparent to him that he needed to revise his withholdings strategy and resolve
his income tax situation. He stated that he had retained the services of a certified public
accountant (CPA) in February 2020; however, “after the onset of the pandemic, we had
individually  gotten  distracted  with  personal  affairs  and  lost  touch  with  the  process.”
(SOR Answer) After Applicant began working for his current employer, he retained the
services of another CPA and stated that he was collecting the necessary documentation
to file his back tax returns: “My tax advisor and I are currently working on . . . all of my
tax returns  in  order to bring  me  up  to  date  with  the  IRS.” (SOR Answer)  He concluded
his Answer by stating that he would present tax filing documents at his DOHA hearing.
Applicant explained when his continued hearing reconvened that he had retained
a  CPA  only  a  week  before  (in  June  2021):  He  clarified  that  despite  “the  Tax
Engagement  Letter  that  I  received  from  [the  CPA],  I  have  yet  to  actually  retain  them
with. But that is where we’re  at in the  process right now.”  (Tr. 1 at 9-14) At his August
12,  2021  hearing,  when  asked  about  the  progress  he  made  in  filing  his  delinquent
income tax returns, Applicant stated:
As far as  my  accounting  firm  is  concerned,  they  are basically  almost done
with  it. A  partner that I’ve  been  working  with, their  work is being  reviewed
by   another   partner  and   the   documents  should  be   coming   to   me   by   this
Friday. That’s the update I received earlier. I had a look at the tax returns
for years 2016,  ’17,  ’18.  As  far as  the  amount  owed,  they  saw  mine  with
my estimates  that  I  originally disclosed  in  the  original interrogation which
were approximately $7,000 per tax year from 2016 to 2018. (Tr. 2 at 8)
When asked about the status of his 2019 and 2020 income tax returns, Applicant
stated that his CPA was going to bring those income tax returns up to date. Applicant
estimated  that  he  would  owe  “about  $41,000  to  $43,000”  in  past-due  federal  income
taxes for tax years 2016 to 2020, requiring him to set up a payment plan with the IRS.
He acknowledged that his employer, a defense contractor, derives their revenue at least
in part from money collected from taxes. Applicant was unsure when he would be able
to reach an agreement with the IRS regarding a payment plan. (Tr. 2 at 8-14)
In short, as of the date the record closed, Applicant had not filed his income tax
returns for tax years 2016 through 2018.  His returns for tax years 2019 and 2020 are
also unfiled.
Foreign Influence
The SOR lists one  allegation under this concern as a result of  Applicant having
family  connections  in  India.  Applicant’s  family  connections  are  established  by  his  July
15,  2019  SF-86;  his  August  23,  2019  Office  of  Personnel  Management  Personal
to  DOHA
Subject
Interrogatories; and his undated SOR Answer. (GE 1 through 3; SOR Answer.)
Interview  (OPM  PSI);  his  December  15,  2020  Response
SOR  ¶  2.a  –  Applicant’s  grandmother,  several  aunts,  uncles  and  cousins
are  citizens  and  residents  of  India.  Applicant  admitted  the  relatives  as  alleged,  but
denied  that  they  are  a  Guideline  B  national  security  concern.  In  his  SOR  Answer,  he
provided the following information regarding his relatives in India:
.  .  .  in  the   interests  of   addressing   these   concerns  very   precisely,  any
conversations  I  have   had   in  the   past   with   my   extended   family   consist  of
topics of conversation  limited  to  health  of myself and  my  family  members
and   what  hobbies  I  am   interested   and   pursuing   of   late.  The   primary
reason  for the   limited   extent  of   our conversations  is due   to   the   language
barrier.  I  personally   speak  the   native   language   of   my   extended   family,
Telugu, at a  1st  grade  level and  cannot read  or write. My  extended  family
similarly  has very  limited  English  fluency. Beyond  that,  there is never any
mention  of work or subjects remotely relating  to  my  work. (SOR Answer)
Applicant  speaks  “very  infrequently”  to  his  grandmother,  aunts,  uncles,  and
cousins in India. He does not send them any money. He said his relationship with them
would not have any effect on his ability to protect national security. None of Applicant’s
relatives  living  in  India  work  for  the  Indian  government  except  one  cousin.  Applicant
does not communicate with that cousin. (Tr. 2 at 17-18) Applicant has visited India three
times in 1998, 2003, and 2016. (Tr. 2 at 18) Applicant’s testimony regarding contact with
his relatives in India was consistent with the information he provided during his August
23, 2019 OPM interview. (GE 2)
Applicant  is  a  native-born  U.S.  citizen,  and  was  raised  and  educated  in  the
United  States.  His  immediate  family  consists  of  his  mother,  father,  and  older  brother,
who  are  all  naturalized  U.S.  citizens,  and  live  in  the  United  States.  Applicant
communicates  with  all  three  of his immediate  family  by  text,  email, or telephone  “most
days.” (Tr. 2 at 14-17) He was issued a U.S. passport on November 12, 2020, and has
never been issued a foreign passport or identity card by a country other than the United
States.  (GE  1)  Outside  of  his  immediate  family,  Applicant  has  a  “maternal  uncle”  and
“some  paternal  relatives”  and  “one  more  that’s  failing  me  right  now”  that  live  in  the
United States. (Tr. 2 at 17)
Applicant’s  mother  is  a  homemaker  and  his  father  works  for  his  local  county
government  as  a  civil  engineer.  (Tr.  2  at  18-19)  Applicant  owns  a  car  and  has  three
401(k)/retirement accounts valued at approximately $140,000. All of these are assets in
the United States. He has no financial ties to India. He is registered to vote in the United
States and exercises that right. (Tr. 2 at 19-21) Applicant has no plans to relocate to or
retire in India. (Tr.  at 22)
