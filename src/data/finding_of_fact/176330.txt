Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance.  Applicant  denied  generally  each  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR  with
explanations covering the financial allegations that included admissions. Findings of fact
follow.
Background
Applicant married in January 2017 and has four children from prior relationships,
two  of  whom  reside  with  him  and  his  wife.  (GE  1;  Tr.  17,  33-34)  He  earned  a  high
school diploma  in  June  2005.  (GE  1) Applicant  did  not  report  any  military service  and
has never held a security clearance. (GE 1)
Since  June  2019,  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  his  current  employer  as  a
heavy  equipment  mechanic.  (GEs  1-2;  Tr.  17,  19-20)  Between  June  2005  and  June
2019, he worked for other employers in various technician jobs. (GE 1; Tr. 20-21)
Applicant’s finances
Between  2015  and  2019,  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  and  state
income tax returns. (GE 2) His tax records document his preparing and filing his federal
and  state  tax  returns  for  these  years  (2015-2019)  in  July  2020.  (GE  2;  Tr.  25-26)
Applicant attributed his failures to timely file his tax returns to  his limited understanding
of  the  importance  of  timely  filing  of  his  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  and  his
reserving no withholding on both his federal and state tax withholding forms. (GE 2; Tr.
23-24)
For tax   years 2015-2019,  Applicant  accumulated  delinquent federal taxes  owed
for  these   tax   years  as   follows:  $10,515   for  tax   year  2015;   $11,790   for  tax   year  2016,
$9,709  for tax  year 2017; $2,888  for tax  year 2018, and  $3,718  for  tax  year 2019. (GE
2) Cumulative  federal taxes owed  for these   2015-2019  tax  years totaled  $38,620.  (GE
2; Tr. 24-25)
Besides  accruing  over  $38,000  in  delinquent  federal  taxes  for  tax  years  2015-
2019, Applicant accumulated approximately $18,363 in delinquent state taxes owed his
state  of  residence  for  these  tax  years.  His  reported  delinquent  state  taxes  are  as
follows:  $3,582 for tax year 2015; $3,829 for tax year 2016;  $3,124 for tax year 2017;
$1,396 for tax year 2018; and $6,432 for tax year 2019. (GE 2)
In  April  2021  (following  the  issuance  of  the  SOR),  Applicant  entered  into  an
installment  agreement  with  the  IRS  to  pay  off  his accrued  delinquent federal  taxes  for
tax years 2016-2017 and 2019. (AE C) Monthly payments set by the IRS called for initial
payments of $245 a month, beginning in May 2021, and increased payments of $440 a
month,  beginning  in  May  2022.  (AE  C)  Furnished  debit  balances  from  the  IRS  report
reduced  balances  owed  for  these  tax  years  as  follows:  2015  (0  balance  owing),  2016
($5,952  balance  owing),  2017  ($5,536  balance  owing),  2018  ($1,973  balance  owing),
and 2019 ($8,048 balance owing). (AE F) These reported balances total approximately
$21,509  and  implicitly  reflect  cumulative  interest  and  penalties  accrued,  as  well  as
reductions  attributable  to  credited  Applicant  payments  and  other  credits.  (AE  F)
Whether Applicant has maintained his compliance with the terms and conditions set by
the IRS in his installment agreement is not fully validated.
In  July  2021  (following  the  issuance  of  the  SOR),  Applicant  entered  into  an
installment  agreement  with  his  state  of  residence.  (AE  E)  Under  the  terms  of  this
installment  agreement,  Applicant  obligated  himself  to  accept  monthly  electronic  fund
deductions from his checking account in the amount of $379, beginning in August 2021.
(AE  E)  Installment  terms  required  Applicant  to  maintain  adequate  funds  in  his  bank
account  for  the  electronic  funds  withdrawal  each  month,  beginning  in  August  2021.
Whether  Applicant  has  maintained  his  compliance  with  his  state
installment
agreement’s conditions and requirements is unclear. (AE E)
In  addition  to  his  tax  debt  delinquencies,  Applicant  incurred  a  deficiency  on  a
$17,196  car  loan  he  took  out  in  December  2015  to  finance  his  purchase  of  an
automobile.  (GEs  2-4)  Finance  terms  called  for  monthly  payments  of  $697  for  36
months. (GEs 2-4) After his wife quit her job to stay home with their daughter who had
special medical needs, Applicant faced considerable insurance co-pays on his hospital
and  other  medical  bills  associated  with  his  daughter’s  medical  needs.  As  a  working
father with only his income to manage his household needs, he  could no longer afford
the monthly payments on his automobile. (GE 2; Tr.21-22)
After making his last payment on his SOR 1.a vehicle loan balance in December
2018, Applicant surrendered the vehicle to the auto vendor. (GE 4; Tr. 22-23) He later
learned that the vehicle was sold at auction for less than the amount he owed on his car
loan. (GE 2 and AE B; Tr. 22-23) With his wife’s return to the work force, Applicant was
able to pay off the reported deficiency balance (n May 2021) following the public sale of
the  vehicle  at  a  published  auction.  (AE  B;  Tr.  18)  Why  he  waited  so  long  (over  four
months  after  the  issuance  of  the  SOR  in  January  2021)  to  pay  off  his  SOR  ¶  1.a
deficiency balance is unclear. (AE B; Tr. 22-23)
Applicant’s  April  2021  credit  report  reflects  considerable  improvement  in  his
management  of  his  finances.  (AE  D)  His  most  recent  credit  report  assigned  credit
scores ranging between 625 and 642 and included a serious delinquency that kept his
credit score from moving into a higher scoring range. (AE D)
