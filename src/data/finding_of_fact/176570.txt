Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into
the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 40 years old. He earned an associate degree in 2012 and a bachelor’s
degree in 2014. He married in 2018 and has two children ages 11 and 2. He has been
employed as a federal contractor since 2009 and with his current employer since 2019.
He lists no periods of unemployment on his security clearance application (SCA). (Item
1)
The SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling approximately $113,378. Applicant
attributed his financial issues to an unsuccessful real estate investment he made in 2016.
He used personal loans and credit cards to make the down payment and for repairs on
the property he purchased. By 2018 he was unable to make payments on the accounts
and  they  went  into  collection.  The  accounts  are  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  ($24,093),  1.c
($18,544), 1.d ($9,807), and 1.e ($27,209). In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he states
for each debt that he has been in contact with the financial institution associated with the
debt to resolve it and is working on a payment plan. He further stated:
I am working on repairing all of this and I have a tangible plan that can get
this debt resolved within the next 2 years. I am a part-time real estate agent
and I have been investing in single family rental properties. I plan to use the
money I can earn in selling real estate and by refinancing the homes I have
purchased  to  pay  off  the  debts  mentioned  in  the  Statement  of  Reasons.
(Item 2)
Regarding the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a, Applicant stated that this debt is an outstanding
car  loan.  He  sub-leased  the  car  to  someone  and  that  person  stopped  making  the  car
payments and let the insurance lapse. He is unable to locate the person and the car. In
his September 2020 background interview with a government investigator, he stated that
he has been in contact with the creditor. In his answer to the SOR he said he was in touch
with the creditor to resolve the debt and is working on a payment plan. (Items 2, 4)
The debts in the SOR are corroborated by Applicant’s admissions in his answer to
the SOR, his statements to the government investigator, and credit reports from July 2020
and May 2021. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5)
Applicant did not provide any documentary evidence that he was participating in
payment plans, making payments, or had reached settlement agreements with any of the
creditors.
