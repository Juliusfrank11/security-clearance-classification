Applicant, age 42, has never been married. He has two children, ages 7 and 16.
He received his high school diploma in 1998. He attended an online university from 2009
through  2011,  without  earning  a  degree.  He  has  been  employed  as  an  advanced
manufacturing technician since December 2018 by a defense contractor, with whom he
had been previously employed on a contract basis through another company beginning
in May 2018. He was unemployed from March 2018 through May 2018, after leaving a
previous employer to relocate from State A to State B. This is his first application for a
security clearance. (Item 3)
The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his federal and state tax income tax
returns for tax years 2018 and 2019. It also alleged 10 delinquent debts totaling $23,975,
including  six student-loan  accounts  totaling  $6,950,  an  $11,194  child-support  account,
two utility accounts totaling $1,940, and unpaid federal taxes totaling $3,891 for tax years
2018 and 2019. In his Answer, Applicant admitted all but one of the SOR debts. He denied
the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d (a $126 utility account) on the basis that that it had been
paid. Each alleged debt was confirmed by a December 2020 credit report. (Items 2, 5)
Applicant failed to file, as required, his federal and state income tax returns for tax
years  2018  and 2019,  as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.j  and  1.k.  He  also failed  to  pay federal
income  taxes  for  tax  years  2018  and  2019,  as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.l.  He  attributed  his
failure  to  file  to  a  combination  of  procrastination,  laziness,  and  pandemic-related
challenges in accessing his tax preparer. In his November 2020 SCA, Applicant proffered
plans  to  file  his  2018  returns  with  his  2019  returns.  During  his  January  2021  security
clearance  interview  (SCI),  he  proffered  plans  to  file  his  2018  through  2020  returns  in
February 2021. He asserted that there was zero chance that he would file late again. He
also formulated the following plan to ensure that he would file timely going forward: 1) he
will make a standing appointment with his tax preparer for each filing season; and 2) he
will file his returns as soon as he receives his W-2 form. (Item 2; Item 3 at 33; Item 4 at
1-2; Item 6 at 9)
In his Answer, Applicant asserted that he filed his 2018 and 2019 federal and state
returns in 2020. However, his IRS tax account transcripts revealed that he filed his 2018
through 2020 federal returns in May 2021. His entire 2020 federal refund ($2,215) was
applied  to  his  child-support  debt.  As  of  June  28,  2021,  he  owed  the  IRS  taxes  in  the
amount of $3,764 and $127, respectively, for tax years 2018 and 2019, as alleged in SOR
¶ 1.l. In his Answer, Applicant averred that he was in the process of “filing for a repayment
plan” to resolve his 2018 and 2019 federal tax debt. (Item 2; Item 5 at 13-17)
Applicant filed his 2020 state tax return sometime in or before May 2021, the exact
date of which is not specified in the record. State B used his entire  state tax refund of
$1,153 for tax year 2020 in May 2021 to pay outstanding tax and child-support liabilities.
$493 of the refund was applied towards his child-support debt, and the remainder was
listed as an “internal offset,” with $0 of the refund being received by Applicant. There are
no documents in the record to corroborate that Applicant’s 2018 and 2019 state returns
have been filed. (Item 5 at 14)
The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 1.f through 1.i are student-loan accounts
associated  with  the  online  university  that  Applicant  attended  from  March  2009  until
January  2011,  when  he  stopped  to  focus  on  work  and  to  keep  food  on  the  table.  He
acknowledged  that  he had not made payments  on the  loans  since 2011.  A  December
2020  credit  report  reported  two  of  the  debts  totaling  $2,907  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.c),  as
placed for collection in May 2011 by the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE); and the
remaining four debts totaling $4,043 (SOR ¶¶ 1.f through 1.i), as 120 days or more past
due by Navient (two were opened in July 2009, and two in March 2010). (Item 2; Item 4
at 2, 4-5: Item 5; Item 6 at 18)
The  record  did  not  indicate  whether  the  Navient  loans  are  federal  or  private.
However,  Applicant  claimed  that  Navient  serviced  all  six  loans,  without  providing  any
corroborating documentation. He maintained that, despite his efforts, he has been unable
to reach the USDOE to confirm whether the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c are, in
fact, being serviced by Navient. The Navient loans were in forbearance from March 2021
until February 2022, which he stated he applied for because he had children and had a
hard time making ends meet. In his Answer, he asserted that he was “awaiting payment
info  after  forbearance  expired”  on  the  Navient  loans,  and  that  the  U.S.  Department  of
Education “could not be reached to inquire about details” of those loans. (Item 2; Item 4
at 2, 4-5: Item 5; Item 6 at 18)
I, sua sponte, took administrative notice of the fact that, beginning March 13, 2020,
due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  USDOE  has  been  providing  emergency  relief  on
federal  student  loans,  including  the  suspension  of  loan  payments  and  collections  on
defaulted loans. On April 6, 2022, President Biden extended that COVID-19 relief through
August 31, 2022.1

The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  is  a  cell-phone  account  placed  for  collection  by
Provider A. Applicant opened the account approximately 14 years ago for two phones,
one for himself and the other for his oldest child. He asserted that he was current with the
account for about 11 or 12 years, until he could no longer afford the monthly payment. He
attempted to return the phones to Provider A to resolve the debt. However, Provider A
would not accept them due to the terms of his service contract agreement. He then tried
to resolve the debt by obtaining service with a new provider, with the expectation that he
would be given a credit for his two existing phones sufficient to repay the debt. However,
he was not given that credit due to the age of the phones. At some point, he received a
letter from a collection agent for Provider A. He claimed that he could not afford to pay
the collection debt. In his SCA, he promised to resolve the debt by the end of November
2020. During his SCI, he asserted that he planned to negotiate with the collection agent
in an attempt to settle for a lesser amount. In his Answer, he stated that he had “not yet
set up a payment plan.” (Item 2; Item at 38; Item 4 at 4)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d is an account placed for collection by Applicant’s
former internet-service provider with whom he had service in 2017. Although he asserted
that he was not delinquent on his account when he closed the account and returned his
equipment in 2018, there remained a balance for unpaid fees. In his SCA, he promised
to resolve the debt by the end of November 2020. During his SCI, he maintained that he
was  still  attempting to  contact  the  creditor to  satisfy  the  debt  in  full.  In  his Answer,  he
claimed  that  he  paid  the  debt,  without  proffering  any  corroborating  documentation.  In
(Item 2; Item 3 at 37; Item 4 at 4).
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e is the arrearage amount that Applicant owes for his
youngest child’s support. He claimed that he had been timely paying $800 per month for
a period between mid to late 2017. Then, he was only paying “whatever and whenever
he could” due to his unemployment for a period of about seven to eight months beginning
in March 2018, which the state considered a gift rather than child support. On a date not
indicated in the record, State A garnished his wages in the monthly amount of $1,064,
including $800 for child support and $264 for the arrearage. Once he began working for
his current employer in December 2018, State B adjusted his wage garnishment to his
new salary, in an amount not indicated in the record, without including any amount for the
arrearage, to which he attributes the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e. During his SCI, he averred
that  his  various  attempts  to  reach  State  B  to  discuss  a  resolution  of  his  debt  were
unsuccessful. In his Answer, he stated: “In process of coming to an agreement with other
party involved.” A child-support order is not in place for his oldest child because he shares
joint custody with her mother. (Item 2; Item 3 at 35; Item 4 at 2)
During his SCI, Applicant asserted that he was current with all of his day-to-day
expenses. The only credit report in the record,  from  December 2020, revealed that he
brought current an automobile loan account that had been 60 days past due. It also shows
that he took out a cash loan in the amount of $1,500 in July 2020, with a payment of $261
per month and a balance of $1,201, which was then current. (Item 4 at 5; Item 5 at 6)
Applicant  reported  one  period  of  unemployment  between  March  2018  and  May
2018, during which he received unemployment benefits in the amount of $1,200 to $1,500
bi-weekly. He was employed from September 2016 until March 2018, when he relocated
from State A to State B. There is no information in the record about the reason for his
relocation. His May 2021 paystub revealed an annual income of approximately $54,000,
including overtime. It also showed that his wages are garnished in the amount of about
$305 per pay period; and, that he pays about $20 per pay period towards a 401k loan.
There  was  no  other  information  in  the  record  about  that  loan.  The  paystub  does  not
indicate any details about the garnishment. The record otherwise contains scant details
surrounding  his  income  and  expense  history.  The  record  does  not  indicate  whether
Applicant sought or received financial counseling. (Item 3 at 15-16; Item 4 at 6)
