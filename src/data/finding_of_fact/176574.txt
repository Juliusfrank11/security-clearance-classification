The SOR alleges that, as of June 29, 2021, Applicant owed charged-off debts of
$3,110 (SOR ¶ 1.b); $15,894 (SOR ¶ 1.d); $29,951 (SOR ¶ 1.e); and $23,545 (SOR ¶ 1.f).
Additionally, the SOR alleges that Applicant owed collection debts of $1,770 (SOR ¶ 1.a)
and $42,233 (SOR ¶ 1.c). When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted the alleged
debts but stated that he had sold his home and paid them off. (Item 1.)
After considering  Items 1  through  9, and  Applicant’s exhibits A  through  C, I make
the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 54 years old and twice divorced. He was married to his first wife from
December 1989 to July 1999 and to his second wife from December 2006 to January
2022. He has one daughter, age 17, from his second marriage. (Item 2; AE A.)
Applicant served honorably on active duty in the United States military from June
1987 to April 1997. He was granted a DOD security clearance for his military duties and
retained clearance eligibility throughout his career. (Item 3.) On his discharge from the
military, he became employed by a defense contractor as a site manager. Over the next 17
years, he worked at various remote field sites overseas. He has been with his current
employer, also a defense contractor, since September 2014. (Item 2.) He has no education
beyond his general education diploma (GED). (Item 3.)
Shortly after returning to the United States in September 2014 for his current job,
Applicant purchased a home in October 2014. He obtained a mortgage solely in his name
for $459,675. In February 2017, that loan was paid off, likely through a refinancing, as he
took on a mortgage of $485,510 with another lender at that time. The monthly payments on
that mortgage loan were $2,899. (Item 4.) In May 2016, Applicant was granted a top secret
security clearance. (Items 8, 9.)
In May 2017, Applicant and his second wife separated. In June 2020, they entered
into a formal separation agreement under which Applicant agreed to pay his now ex-wife
$1,000 per month for 120 months. Applicant was given exclusive use and possession of
their marital residence, which was deeded in his name. He also assumed sole legal and
physical custody of their daughter and agreed to cooperate with his ex-wife on all matters
concerning their daughter. He was responsible for all outstanding credit-card debts in his
name and on those credit-card debts listed in his spouse’s name as of the date of their
separation agreement, but not for any debts incurred by her subsequent to the agreement.
(Item 3.)
In  February 2020, Applicant’s employer was informed  that the  DOD Continuous
Evaluation Program developed unreported information that Applicant was delinquent on
three  accounts  totaling  $57,523.  (Item  8.)  On  April  4,  2020,  Applicant  completed  and
certified  to  the  accuracy of  a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In
response to SF 86 inquiries into his financial record, Applicant stated that he was working
with a bankruptcy lawyer to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition as he had a hard time
paying all his bills in the past year and a half. Regarding any delinquency involving routine
accounts, Applicant listed one debt — a debt consolidation loan for $42,233 (SOR ¶ 1.c) —
that he planned to include in a bankruptcy filing. (Item 2.)
As of June 17, 2020, Applicant was making his mortgage payment according to
terms, although his account had been 30 days past due in February 2020 and March 2020.
His credit report showed that the $42,233 debt (SOR ¶ 1.c, account opened June 2016)
was placed for collection in October 2018. Additionally, a credit union had charged off
credit-card balances of $29,951 in April 2020 (SOR ¶ 1.e, account opened July 2002) and
$15,894 in May 2020 (SOR ¶ 1.d, account opened April 2009). An unsecured loan with the
same credit union, obtained for $30,000 in June 2017, was past due $3,689 on a balance
of  $23,305  (SOR  ¶  1.f).  Credit-card  debts  of  $3,110  (SOR  ¶  1.b,  account  opened
September 2017) and $12,180 (not alleged, account opened August 2006) were charged
off in December 2018 and January 2019, respectively. (Item 4.) In July 2020, a fast cash
lender placed a $1,770 debt (SOR ¶ 1.a) for collection. (Item 5.)
When asked during his October 2020 PSI about the finances, Applicant stated that
he was in the process of filing for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy so that could consolidate his
debts totaling between $120,000 and $130,000. He explained that his second wife had bad
spending habits, opened multiple credit-card accounts without his knowledge, and ran up
balances that she did not pay. He stated that he obtained a loan from a credit union to pay
off  some  of  his  second  wife’s  debts,  although  when  confronted  about  the  adverse
information  on  his  credit  report,  he  stated  that  the  loan  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  (which  was  not
obtained from the credit union) was that debt. He asserted that his then spouse opened up
new credit-card accounts and ran up more debt. When he could not get his mounting debt
under control, he obtained legal counsel to file for bankruptcy.
When confronted with the delinquencies on his credit report by the investigator,
Applicant stated that the $3,110 credit-card debt (SOR ¶ 1.b) was paid. He expressed his
belief that the charged-off balances in SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.f were on credit cards used by
his second wife, but added that he may also have used the credit cards to pay some bills.
(Item 3.) He asserted that the $12,180 charged-off credit-card debt (not alleged) was also a
debt incurred by his second wife, and that she opened most of the credit-card accounts
without his knowledge. However, he had accepted repayment responsibility for all of the
debts. (Item 3.)
During  his PSI,  Applicant reported  annual gross income  from  his employment of
$197,000   while   his  spouse’s  income   was  inconsistent.   He  estimated   her  earnings  at
$30,000  in 2019. He related  that in addition  to  spousal support at $1,000  a  month, he  had
monthly   expenses  totaling   $7,390,  which  left  him   discretionary   income   of   $3,214   per
month. He stated that he was living within his means and was willing and able to pay his
debts. (Item 3.)
Applicant’s credit reports show that all of the SOR debts as well as the $12,180
unalleged delinquency were opened as individual accounts in his name. (Items 4-6.) He did
not explain how his spouse could have opened accounts in his name and run up balances
without his knowledge.
On  October  26,  2020,  Applicant  was  re-contacted  by  the  OPM  investigator.  He
explained that his separation agreement with his second wife, which was executed in June
2020, was not filed with the court until late October 2020. He explained that he had not
filed for bankruptcy as he had been advised to wait until his divorce was final to ensure that
his  ex-wife  was  not  included  in  his bankruptcy.  (Item  3.) In  December 2020,  a  default
judgment was granted against Applicant for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c. Court records reflect
that Applicant had been served with the complaint on November 3, 2020. (Item 7.)
On  November  19,  2020,  Applicant’s  employer  was  informed  that  the  DOD
Continuous  Evaluation  Program  had  developed  unreported  information  about  six
delinquent accounts totaling $126,913. His employer was advised to file an incident report.
(Item 9.) It is unclear whether an incident report was filed with the DCSA CAF.
In October 2020, Applicant paid off in a lump sum the $5,022 balance on a $39,430
car loan obtained in June 2015. In December 2020, he paid off his mortgage balance of
$449,501 and took on a new mortgage for $461,579. (Item 5.)
As of July 30, 2021, Applicant had made no payments on the debts in the SOR. It is
unclear  whether  Applicant  knew  about  the  judgment  debt  at  that  time.  The  $12,180
charged-off  debt  (unalleged)  was  paid  off  in  May  2021.  Applicant  was  making  timely
payments on a credit-card account opened in May 2019 which had a $1,146 balance, and
on  an  automobile  loan  obtained  for  $32,629  in  October  2015.  The  balance  of  the
automobile loan was $2,027 after his June 2021 payment. He was making timely payments
of $2,421 per month on his mortgage. (Item 5.)
Applicant asserted on September 17, 2021, that he sold his house, and with the
proceeds paid off all of the debts alleged in the SOR. (Item 1.) A check of his credit on
January 5, 2022, reflected no progress toward resolving the $3,110 debt (SOR ¶ 1.a).
However, his credit report showed that his mortgage loan was paid off in August 2021, and
that the $15,894 charged-off credit-card balance (SOR ¶ 1.d) was settled for less than its
full  balance  at  that  time.  The  $23,545  unsecured  loan  delinquency  (SOR  ¶  1.f)  and
$29,951 credit-card delinquency (SOR ¶ 1.e) were settled for less than their full balances in
October 2021. The consolidation loan in SOR ¶ 1.c was listed as having a zero balance
after charge off. His credit report reflected zero payments on that account since September
2018. (Item 6.)
On January 26, 2022, Applicant asserted in response to the FORM that he had
settled and paid all his debts at issue with the proceeds from selling his house in lieu of a
Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing. He added that he was able to obtain a mortgage on a new
home for him and his daughter; that he had no other outstanding debt obligations; and that
with the finalization of their divorce, his second wife no longer had access to any of his
accounts. (Item 1.)
The final order of divorce, entered in late January 2022, indicates that Applicant’s
ex-wife  was  not  required  to  pay  child  support  for  their  daughter.  The  terms  of  their
separation agreement were incorporated within the divorce decree. Accordingly, Applicant
is obligated to continue paying spousal support to his ex-wife of $1,000 a month until June
2030. (AE A.)
Applicant’s current credit report shows that he bought a new home in January 2022,
taking on  a  mortgage obligation of  $352,240 with repayment at $1,909 per month. He
obtained an automobile loan of $22,756 in late February 2022, to be repaid at $410 per
month. He also opened a new cellphone account in March 2022, incurring a $230 debt.
With  the  intention  of  rebuilding  his  credit,  Applicant  opened  a  credit-card  account  in
October 2021 with a $1,000 credit limit and a credit-card account in March 2022 with a
$3,000 limit. Those accounts had zero balances as of April 2022. (AEs B, C.) The debt in
SOR  ¶  1.a  was  no  longer on  his credit  report. The credit-card debt in SOR ¶ 1.b was
reported as having been settled for less than its full balance in January 2022. The debt in
SOR ¶ 1.c was on his current credit report as having a zero balance, but with no indication
of  any  payments  since  the  October  2018  charge  off.  (AE  B.)  Applicant  completed  a
homeownership education course in December 2021 as well as a financial management
course. (AE C.)
Applicant indicated in response to the FORM that he did not intend to be in debt or
use credit in the future unless he must. He regards dealing with the financial issues as a
“life changing event for [him] that resulted in a long divorce battle with [his] ex-wife so [he]
could change [his] life and take care of [his] daughter and provide for her better.” (AE B.)
