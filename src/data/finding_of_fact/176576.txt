Applicant admitted to all the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with the defense contractor since about December of 2021. He does not hold
a security clearance. Applicant  is married, and has one child. (TR at page 22 line 7 to
page 23 line 7, and GX 1 at page 7.) Applicant attributes his current financial difficulties
to  extended  periods  of  unemployment,  from  about  2012~2016,  and  again  from  about
2017 until the start of his current employment. (TR at page 38 lines 7~18.)
