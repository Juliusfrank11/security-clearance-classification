Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations,  with  explanations.  His  admissions  are
incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I
make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 69-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began  working
at his present job in July 2004. He also has owned a home-based business since 1999
(Bus. A). He retired from the U.S. Air Force as a lieutenant colonel in 1995. He served
from  1974  to  1995  as  a  missile  officer.  He  holds  a  master’s  degree.  He  has  been
married for 47 years and has two adult children. (Tr. 19-21, 32, 34, 41; GE 1)
Applicant  first  received  a  security  clearance  when  he  was  commissioned  in  the
Air Force in 1974. He has since held a clearance for over forty years without incident.
According to his current supervisor, Applicant handles classified information on a daily
basis in a secured facility and has never had a security incident or violation. (Tr. 20, 32,
47; GE 1)
The SOR alleged Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for
years  2012-2014  and  2016.  It  also  alleged  that  he  failed  to  file  his  state  income  tax
returns for years 2012-2016. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.b). The basis for the allegations came to
light when Applicant voluntarily admitted not filing his tax returns when he completed his
August  2017  security  clearance  application  (SCA).  Those  admissions  establish  the
allegations by substantial evidence. (GE 1)
Applicant credibly explained that he failed to file his federal and state tax returns
for the stated years initially because he had not kept good records for Bus. A and that
caused him to delay filing his tax returns. This occurred starting with tax year 2012. He
was  never  able  to  get  the  records  together  to  file  his  2012  returns  and  this  then
impacted  the  succeeding  years. Everything snowballed  on  him  after that.  He  stated  in
his 2017 SCA that he would complete and file the delinquent tax returns by September
2017.  He  acknowledged  that  he  failed  to  meet  that  self-imposed  deadline.  During  his
September  2018  background  interview,  he  told  that  investigator  that  he  anticipated
resolving all his tax issues by December 2018. He acknowledged that he failed to meet
that self-imposed deadline because he still did not have his tax records organized. (Tr.
21z, 33-34; GE 1-2)
The status of Applicant’s federal and state tax return filings is as follows:
Tax Year 2012:
Federal  tax  return:  Between  2017  and  2019,  when  Applicant  was  gathering  the
necessary information to file his delinquent tax returns, he contacted the IRS and was
told  by  a  representative  that  he  need  not  file  his  2012  return  because  it  was  too  old.
Relying on that advice, when he filed the remainder of his delinquent federal returns in
2019, he did not file his 2012 return. When he realized that he needed to file his 2012
return  for  his  security  clearance,  he  did  so  in  December  2021.  He  also  paid  $3,470
toward any delinquent taxes owed, interest, and penalties. (Tr. 21-22, 24; AE A)
State  tax  return:  Documents  show  that  Applicant’s  2012  state  tax  return  was
processed  in  January  2017  and  that  all  resulting  taxes,  interest,  and  penalties  owed
were paid by October 2017. (GE 2)
Tax Year 2013:
Federal  tax  return:  In  April  2014,  Applicant  timely  filed  an  extension  to  file  his
federal return by October 2014. He also made a $500 estimated payment at the time he
filed his extension. Applicant was unable to gather the necessary information to file his
return by the October extension deadline. In May 2019, Applicant filed his 2013 federal
return.  He  included  a  $2,321  tax  payment  with  the  return.  In  October  2019,  he  paid
$1,744 in interest and penalties that he owed.  (Tr. 25-26; AE B)
State  tax  return:  Documents  show  that  Applicant’s  2013  state  tax  return  was
processed  in  October  2017  and  that  all  resulting  taxes,  interest,  and  penalties  owed
were paid by October 2017. (GE 2)
Tax Year 2014:
Federal  tax  return:  In  April  2015,  Applicant  timely  filed  an  extension  to  file  his
federal return by October 2015. He also made a $1,500 estimated payment at the time
he filed his extension. Applicant was unable to gather the necessary information to file
his  return  by  the  October  extension  deadline.  In  May  2019,  Applicant  filed  his  2014
federal return. He included a $3,202 tax payment with the return. In October 2019, he
paid the remaining amount owed for interest and penalties. (Tr. 25-26; AE C)
State  tax  return:  Documents  show  that  Applicant’s  2014  state  tax  return  was
processed in August 2018 and that all resulting taxes, interest, and penalties owed were
paid by November 2018. (GE 2)
Tax Year 2015:
Federal  tax  return:  No  federal  return  alleged.  However,  this  return  was  filed  in
May 2019 and the resulting tax, interest, and penalties have all been paid. (Tr. 27; AE
D)
State  tax  return:  Documents  show  that  Applicant’s  2015  state  tax  return  was
processed in April 2017 and that all resulting taxes, interest, and penalties owed were
paid by July 2017. (GE 2)
Tax Year 2016:
Federal  tax  return:  In  April  2017,  Applicant  timely  filed  an  extension  to  file  his
federal return by October 2017. He also made a $6,000 estimated payment at the time
he filed his extension. Applicant was unable to gather the necessary information to file
his  return  by  the  October  extension  deadline.  In  April  2019,  Applicant  filed  his  2016
federal  return.  He  included  a  $10,085  tax  payment  with  the  return.  In  June  2019,  he
paid $819 for interest and penalties that he owed. (Tr. 27; AE E)
State tax return:  Applicant believed that he filed his 2016 state tax return at the
same time he filed his 2016 federal return (in April 2019), however, he discovered that
was not the case. He made a payment of $600 towards any tax owed in April 2017. He
filed his 2016 return in February 2022. (Tr. 27; GE 2; AE L)
Applicant  documented  that  after  tax  year  2016,  all  federal  and  state  income
returns  have  been  timely filed  and  all  resulting  taxes  were  timely  paid.  (Tr.  22,  27-28;
GE 2; AE F)
Applicant has learned much from his dilatory actions in filing his taxes. He failed
to  act  sooner  to  remedy  his  problem  because  he  felt  overwhelmed.  He  now  has
organized  his self-employment  business  records  so  that  the problems  that  created  his
tax-filing delay will no  longer plague him.  He has also received  advice  from  a certified
public accountant (CPA) concerning his tax issues. He also will most probably hire a tax
professional  to  prepare  and  file  his  tax  returns  in  the  future.  He  understands
government  rules and regulations  are important and has no problem  with  the U.S.  tax
process. He is not a tax protestor. He has the resources necessary to always be able to
pay his taxes. He and his wife have combined income in excess of $200,000. They also
have  retirement  accounts  valued  over  $800,000.  He  has  a  credit  score  of  775  and  he
timely pays all of his debts. (Tr. 21, 30; AE G, K)
Applicant’s immediate supervisor testified that Applicant is an excellent performer
and  was the  top  performer last  year. The  supervisor is aware of  Applicant’s tax issues
and despite those, he recommends that Applicant retain his security clearance. He has
no concerns about Applicant’s ability to protect classified information. (Tr. 45-47)
Applicant  presented  statements  from  a  former  and  a  current  coworker,  both
attest to his integrity, work ethic, trustworthiness, honesty, and good judgment. They are
fully aware of Applicant’s tax issues, but they also recommend that he retain his security
clearance. The former coworker  also works as  a volunteer tax  preparer and conveyed
that Applicant’s tax problem is not unique. (AE I, J)
