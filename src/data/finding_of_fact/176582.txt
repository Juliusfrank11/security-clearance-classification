Applicant  denied  one  SOR  allegation  (¶  1.a)  and  admitted  the  second  SOR
allegation, with explanations (¶ 1.b). His admission is adopted as a finding of fact. After
a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  59  years  old.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  federal
contractor as a surveyor since February 2018. He is a high school graduate. He served
in the Air National Guard from 1984 to 1990, when he was administratively discharged
under  other  than  honorable  conditions.  He  married  in  1983  and  divorced  in  1987.  He
has one adult child. (Items 2, 3).
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  2013  through  2019  federal
income  tax  returns,  as  required,  and  that  he  also  failed  to  file  his  2015-2017  state
income  tax  returns,  as  required.  (¶¶  1.a-1.b).  Applicant  admitted  in  his  August  2020
security clearance application (SCA) that he failed to file his 2014-2017 federal income
tax returns. There is no record evidence to support that Applicant failed to timely file his
2013, 2018, or 2019 federal tax returns as alleged. I find for Applicant on those specific
years within SOR ¶ 1.a. During his August 2021 background investigation interview, he
confirmed  that  he  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  tax  returns  for  2014-2017.  (Items  1
(Applicant’s answer), 2, 3)
Applicant  admitted  in  his  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  that  he  failed  to
timely file his state income tax returns for 2015-2017. He confirmed his SCA admissions
during  his  background  interview  in  August  2021.  He  also  admitted  that  as  of  August
2021, he had not yet filed his state tax returns for 2015-2017. (Items 2, 3)
Applicant claimed that the reason that his 2014-2017 federal tax returns and his
2015-2017  state  tax  returns  were  not  filed  was  because  the  person  he  had  preparing
and supposedly filing all his returns failed to do so. During his background interview, the
investigator asked Applicant for the name of his tax preparer, which Applicant refused to
give.  Applicant  further  claimed  that  he  mailed  all  of  his  delinquent  federal  tax  returns
(2014-2017) to the IRS in November 2021, but he cannot get verification from the IRS
about the filing of these returns. He presented no documentation to support his claimed
actions with the IRS. Concerning his state tax returns for 2015-2017, Applicant claimed
he  filed  the  tax  returns  for  2016  and  2017  in  January  2022  and  that  he  now  disputes
having to file a state tax return for 2015. He provided no supporting documentation. He
attributes  part  of  his filing  delays  to  not  being  able  to  obtain  copies  of  his W-2  wages
statements in a timely manner. (Items 1-3)
Applicant  did  not  provide  information  about  his  current  budget.  There  is  no
documented  evidence  showing  that  he  sought  any  financial  counseling.  In  his  SOR
answer  he  asserted  that  he  lives  within  his  means,  paid  for  a  new  truck  in  2019,  and
saved enough to buy a new home. (Items 1-3)
