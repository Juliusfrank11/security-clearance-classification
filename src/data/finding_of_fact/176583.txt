Applicant  is  a  46-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  where  he  has
worked  since  January  2019.  He  served  in  the  National  Guard  from  2007  to  2010.  He
attended  college  off  and  on  since  2007  without  earning  a  degree,  and  he  is  currently
enrolled in college. He has never married, but he has lived with his girlfriend for about
eight  years,  and  they  share  two  young  children.  (Tr.  at  16-19,  37-38;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
The   SOR alleges  eight  delinquent  debts. The   debts  consist of   balances due   on
two   auto   loans  after  the   vehicles  were  repossessed   (SOR  ¶¶  1.a   -  $10,953   and   1.e   -
$8,591);  a   defaulted   student  loan   (SOR  ¶  1.b   -  $7,142);  two   medical  debts  totaling
about $165  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.f);  two  debts owed  to  apartment  landlords  (SOR ¶¶ 1.c  -
$613  and  1.g  - $1,912); and  $841  owed  to  a  telecommunications  company  (SOR ¶ 1.h).
Unless  specifically   stated   otherwise  below,  the   debts   are  established   by   credit  reports
and  Applicant’s admissions.
Applicant attributed his financial problems to moving cross country for his job. He
also had periods of unemployment and underemployment. (Tr. at 16; GE 1, 2)
The creditor for the $10,953 auto loan (SOR ¶ 1.a) agreed to reduce the amount
owed to $5,000, but Applicant did not pay it. The debt “aged” off  his most recent credit
report as beyond the seven-year reporting window. He believes the creditor is satisfied
because  his  current  auto  loan  is  with  the  same  financial  institution.  (Tr.  at  20-23;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A)
Applicant asserted that he settled the $8,591 deficiency balance on the auto loan
for  a  repossessed  vehicle  (SOR  ¶  1.e)  for  “$500  something,”  and  that  he  paid  the
settlement  amount  in  2019.  He  stated  the  amount  was  paid  with  a  prepaid  debit  card
from an account he no longer has. The debt is listed by TransUnion and Equifax on the
September 2018 combined credit report with a last action date of December 2014. The
debt is not listed on the Equifax credit reports from 2019, 2020, and 2022. (Tr. at 25-27;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A)
Applicant owes $31,431 for five federal student loans. He is attending college, so
all of the loans, including the defaulted loan alleged in the SOR, are currently deferred.
Four of the loans were taken out within the last two years.  He stated that he was on a
$5 per month loan rehabilitation program in 2019. The 2022 credit report indicates that
Applicant made four payments in 2020 before the COVID-19 pause and he returned to
school. It also shows that he made payments in January and February 2022. (Tr. at 16,
23-24; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A)
Applicant cosigned an apartment lease for a friend. The friend moved out of the
apartment  with  a  balance  of  $613  due  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  The  friend  did  not  pay,  leaving
Applicant responsible. Applicant has not paid the account, but he stated that his friend
told him that she paid the debt. The debt is listed on the 2018 and 2019 credit reports,
showing an activity date of January 2013. The debt is not listed on the 2020 and 2022
credit  reports.  There  is  no  direct  evidence  that  the  debt  was  paid.  (Tr.  at  24-25;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A)
SOR  ¶  1.g  alleges  a  $1,912  debt  owed  to  an  apartment  landlord.  Applicant
admitted he owed the debt. He wrote in his response to the SOR that he was “currently
in works to satisfy debt.” No payments have been made. He stated that he disputed the
amount  of  the  debt.  The  debt  is  listed  by  Experian  on  the  September  2018  combined
credit  report  with  an  activity  date  of  August 2018.  The  debt  is not  listed  on  any  of  the
later Equifax credit reports. (Tr. at 28-29; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A)
Applicant stated  that he  paid  the  two  medical  debts totaling  about  $165  (SOR ¶¶
1.d   and   1.f).   The   debts  are  not  listed   on   any   credit  report  after  2019.   (Tr.   at  17,   25;
Applicant’s response  to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A)
Applicant denied owing the $841 debt to a telecommunications company (SOR ¶
1.h). He stated that a family member stole his identity to open a cable television account
without  his  permission.  The  debt  is  listed  by  Equifax  and  Experian  on  the  September
2018 combined credit report with the annotation: “Account disputed by consumer.” The
activity  date  is  August  2015.  The  debt  is  not  listed  on  the  Equifax  credit  reports  from
2019, 2020, and 2022. (Tr. at 29-30; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A)
Applicant  has  taken  financial  counseling  courses.  He  stated  that  his  finances
have  greatly improved  since  the  start of  his background  investigation,  but  took  “a  little
hit”  because  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  His  girlfriend  lost  her  job  because  of  the
pandemic, and she has been out of work for about a year. (Tr.at 17-20, 34-37, 40-41)
With the exception of the deferred student loan, none of the SOR debts are listed
on  the  April  2022  Equifax  credit  report  submitted  by  Applicant.  However,  that  report
listed  two  new  past-due  debts  and  two  new  charged-off  debts.  A  credit  card  was  $48
past due with a balance of $822, with the last payment in February 2022. An unsecured
installment account was $360 past due with a balance of $4,850, with the last payment
in January 2022. An unsecured installment account was charged off for $4,274, with the
last  payment in  February 2021. An unsecured  installment account was  charged off for
$2,873, with the last payment in November 2020.1 (Tr. at 30-33; AE A)
