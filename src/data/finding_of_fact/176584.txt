Applicant is 33 years old, unmarried, and has a two-year-old daughter. He received
a bachelor’s degree in May 2014, his first master’s degree in May 2019, and his second
master’s degree in April 2021. Since  January 2007, he  has worked  as a self-employed
entrepreneur  (no  further  information  provided).  He  has  been  employed  by  a  state
government since March 2021, as a research scientist. This is his first security clearance
application. (Item 3)
The SOR alleged that Applicant has four delinquent private student loans, totaling
$165,337. In his response to the SOR, he denied all allegations and stated the loans were
charged off and the debts appear with a $0 balance on his credit report. The debts alleged
in the SOR were confirmed by Applicant’s credit bureau reports (CBR) dated December
2021 and June 2021. (Item 2; Item 4 at 11-12; Item 5 at 2-3)
Applicant  made   the   four  delinquent  student  loans  debts  alleged   in  the   SOR
between  June  2010  and  October 2012, while  was he  an  undergraduate  student.  The  last
activity   for  all   four  debts  occurred   in  January   2019,  and   they   were  charged   off   in
approximately   May   2019   by   Applicant’s  student  loan   creditor  (SLC).  The   CBRs   reflect
Applicant as the  “maker,”  or the  primary  person  responsible  for the  debts.  (Item  4  at 11-
12; Item 5  at 2-3)
In   his   April  2021   SCA,  Applicant  disclosed   that  his   private   student  loans   were
charged  off  by  SLC,  because  it  was “unwilling  to  collect an  amout  (sic) that  wouldn’t result
in a  charge  off.  I personally  have  may  (sic) every  attempt possible  to  resolve  this debt.
[SLC] and  my  cosigner have  refused  to  make  resolving  the  issue  possible.” (Item  3  at  45-
46)
In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, he provided December 2021 letters from SLC
indicating  it  was  no  longer  attempting  to  collect  the  delinquent  private  student  loans
alleged in the SOR, and he was no longer required to make payments toward these debts.
This  was  based  upon  the  age  of  each  debt.  Additionally,  SLC  notified  him  that  it  was
required by law to notify the Internal Revenue Service to report the cancellation of a $600
or greater debt, which applied to all of these debts. It is unknown if he has reported the
cancellation of these debts in his 2021 federal tax return. (Item 2)
In Applicant’s Response to the FORM, he claimed that he did everything he could
to satisfy these debts, including: attempting to make partial payments; to set up a payment
plan;  to  remove  a  co-signer;  to  amend  the  monthly  required  payment;  and  to  pay  the
debts. He provided no documentary proof to support these assertions. (AE A)
Applicant blames his co-signer for his inability to make payments toward the SOR
allegations. According to him, SLC would not negotiate with him regarding modifying his
$2,000 monthly loan payments without the involvement of his co-signer, who was “off the
grid,  …uncontactable,  and  unwilling  to  cooperate  with  [SLC]  in  any  circumstance.”
Additionally,  Applicant  asserts  that  SLC  was  held  accountable  in  2016  for  illegal  and
unethical  practices,  which  directly  affected  him  and  his  attempts  to  make  partial  and
modified  payments  toward  his  student  loans.  He  provided  no  documentary  proof  to
support his assertions. (AE A)
Applicant took vacations to Mexico in 2017 and Jamaica in 2018. In June 2021, he
purchased an automobile with a $52,299 loan that has a $831 monthly payment. In July
2021,  he  purchased  an  automobile  with  a  $45,131  loan  that  has  a  $1,002  monthly
payment.  According  to  his  December  2021  CBR,  these  accounts  are  current.  He  has
$143,709 in federal student loans that are currently deferred. He was unemployed from
May 2020 to December 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5)
