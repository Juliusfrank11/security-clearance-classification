The SOR specifies five allegations: SOR. ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant failed to
file federal and  state  tax  returns  for tax  years  2015  through  2019.  In  Applicant’s  initial
December  2020  answer,  he  denied  the  2015  to  2019  tax  returns  were  not  filed,  but
admitted  that  the  2015  to  2018  returns  were  filed  late.  In  response  to  SOR  ¶  1.b,
Applicant admitted his federal taxes  from 2011 to 2015  were not paid when due.  (The
allegation  reads  “through  2016.”)  When  he  submitted  his  December  2000  and  March
2021  answers,  he  was  participating  in  a  repayment  plan  with  the  Internal  Revenue
Service (IRS). In response to SOR ¶ 1.c, Applicant admitted that his state income taxes
for  tax  years  2011  to  2015  were  not  paid  when  due.  (The  allegation  reads  “through
2015.) (Answer to SOR)
In Applicant’s March 1, 2021 supplemental answer, he furnished responses to
SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.e.  He  admitted  SOR  ¶  1.d,  and  provided  information  about  his
participation  in  an  IRS-installment  agreement  activated  on  November  24,  2020.  He
admitted owing the  Federal Government  $145,000  in unpaid federal taxes.  (Tr. 56-57)
He essentially admitted SOR ¶ 1.e, but noted that a payment plan started several years
ago  reduced  the  state tax balance  substantially.  (March  2021  supplemental answer to
SOR)
Applicant married in 2007 and has two sons, 11 and 8 years old. He has lived
in  his  current  home  since  2014.  His  84-year-old  mother-in-law  lives  with  him.  In  June
1998,  he  received  a  certificate  of  completion  in  computer  technology  at  a  computer
learning  center.  He  has  received  several  certifications  in  information  technology  (IT).
(GE 1 at 9, 13, 18; Tr. 20, 24-25; March 2021 supplemental answer to SOR at 2)
Applicant has been employed as an IT exchange systems engineer since
January  2017.  From  October  2015  to  January  2017,  he  was  a  systems  engineer.
Between May 2012 and October 2015, he was a team leader. In previous jobs, he was
a  network  engineer  or  a  systems  engineer.  His  other  source  of  income  is  a  rental
property  that  he  purchased  in  2006.  He  has  had  tenants  for  the  past  ten  years.  Even
though  he  currently  receives  $1,400  a  month  in  rent,  after  subtracting  the  monthly
mortgage  for  the  rental  property,  the  monthly  management  fee,  and  the  condominium
fee, from the rent, he indicated that he loses $400 to $500 a month. (GE 1 at 13-24; GE
2 at 11-12; Tr. 64-71, 111)
From   2006   to   2012,  Applicant  worked   two   jobs   during   the   work  day,  but
taxes were not properly  deducted.  During  the  period, he  worked  full  time  as: a  network
engineer from  April 2005  to  April 2006;  a  systems  analyst from  April 2006  to  April  2007;
an  exchange  administrator from  July  2006  to  February  2008; a  systems  engineer from
April 2007  to  November 2008;  an  exchange  administrator from  November 2008  to  May
2012;  and   an   exchange   team   lead   from   May   2012   to   October  2015.  (GE   1   at  15-20).
According   to   his  e-QIP,  his  jobs  appeared   to   overlap   one   another   rather than   indicate
employment  at  two   jobs  simultaneously.  Applicant  contended   that   several  employers
regarded   him   as  an   independent  contractor  for  their   own   benefit   did  not  withhold   any
taxes   from   his  earnings.  This  employment   status  caused   Applicant  and   his  wife   to
underpay   his taxes.  In   late   2011,   Applicant’s   wife’s  job   was  reduced   to   part-time   work
because  of complications with  the  pregnancy  of  her first child. In  January  2011,  his wife
lost  her job  while  the  child  remained  in  the  hospital for 12  weeks after birth.  She  lost  her
job  in April 2018  for an  unidentified  period. (GE  2  at  13-14;  Answer to  SOR at 3; Tr. 25-
28)
In   2012,  Applicant  quit   his  second   job,  but   in   February   2013,  he   resumed   the
second   employment  after  his  wife’s  medical   bills  related   to   her  pregnancy,  and   other
bills, began appearing in  the  mail. His wife  became  pregnant in  2013  and  gave  birth to a
second   child   in  November   of  that  year.   Working   two   jobs  caused   him   to   live   at  an
apartment away  from  his home  during  the  week. His normal work routine  was to  leave
for work on  Monday  and  not return home  until  late  Friday  night for a  short weekend  with
his family.  Applicant’s  wife   resumed   working   at  some   time   not  indicated   in  the   record.
Then,   her   job   was  eliminated   again  in   2017   or 2018, before  she  found   employment   at
her current job.  (Tr. 27-31)
Applicant’s  tax  returns  were  prepared  by  his  wife  and  the  tax  preparer,  with
help from Applicant who then signed the returns. In 2015, he had his withholdings set at
zero with his filing status as ‘married filing jointly.’ He thought his W-2 withholdings were
sufficient to cover the federal and state taxes, but they were not. In the period between
2013  and  2017,  his  accountant  advised  him  that  his  excessive  earnings  were  the
reason his taxes were so high. His federal tax problems were complicated when the IRS
placed a tax lien on his rental property. Applicant learned from his attorney in the month
before the hearing that although the withholdings that he and his wife set for their jobs
appeared to be sufficient, their earnings pushed them into the higher tax bracket where
their withholdings were insufficient to cover the taxes. (GE 2 at 14; Tr. 29-37)
Applicant testified that in 2017 or 2018, he discovered that his 2016, 2017, and
2018  federal  tax  returns  were  not  filed.  He  claimed  that  he  collected  and  reviewed  a
large quantity of tax-related documents and directed his tax preparer to get the returns
ready for filing. In March 2019, Applicant disclosed his tax problems in his March 2019
security  clearance  application.  He filed  the  2016  through  2018  federal  tax  returns  and
presumably  the  other  returns  in  June  2020.  He  has  made  11  payments  under  IRS
repayment  plan,  making  several  payments  before  the  IRS  activated  the  automatic
withdrawal  in  October  2021.  At  some  time,  he  negotiated  a  repayment  plan  with  the
state  tax  agency  and  began  paying  $480  in  monthly  installments  that  have  steadily
decreased to $288 a month by June 1, 2020. State tax records show that one tax lien
imposed  in  January  2017  was  released  in  February  2021.  The  other  state  tax  lien
imposed in March 2019 was released in March 2021. (GE 1 at 49; GE 2 at 9; Tr. 37-44,
47-49, 49, 51-53; AE D at 1-3)
Though  Applicant  was  participating  in  an  IRS  payment  plan  beginning  in
November 2020, his objective was to take out a loan against his home to extinguish the
delinquent  IRS  income  tax  balance.  Applicant  believed  that  the  prime  mortgage
insurance (PMI) will disappear when he secures the loan against his home. To have the
loan  approved,  Applicant  indicated  he  satisfied  a  medical  collection  account  and  had
two credit card accounts removed from his credit report. The financial actions resulted in
a  130-point  increase  in  his  credit  score  to  680.  Documentation  reflects  that  Applicant
has no IRS liabilities for federal tax years 2011 through 2020. (Tr. 53, 90, 92; AE F at 2,
5; AE G at 3-17)
During cross-examination, Applicant indicated  that he  filed W-2 forms for both
2010 jobs and filed the 2010 federal tax return within the extension period. He knew that
he  could  not  pay  the  $7,000  in  tax  when  he filed  the  2010  return and  agreed  with  his
wife they did not have the funds to pay the tax. He believed he began a repayment plan
at  the  time  (circa  2011)  and  was  paying  $400  to  $500  a  month  until  2018,  but  had  to
stop  when  the  IRS  sought  to  increase  the  monthly  installment  to  $1,500.  He  testified
that  at  some  point  in  2012,  the  IRS  reviewed  the  repayment  plan  and  decided  they
wanted  the  entire  amount  ($7,000)  by  the  end  of  2012.  Applicant  produced  scant
evidence of actual payments under any previous plan before the IRS plan that began in
November 2020. (GE 2 at 6, 14; GE 3 at 3; Tr. 60, 61; AE G at 1-17)
For federal tax year 2011, Applicant owed about $8,000. Because he was
unable  to  pay  the  taxes  due  when  he  filed  the  return  in  April  2012,  he  contemplated
adding  the  past-due  taxes  to  the  existing  payment  plan.  He  recalled  he  and  his  wife
talked about increasing their income withholdings at a higher amount regardless of the
exemptions  that  he  claimed,  but  he  did  not  act  on  increasing  his  withholdings.  For
federal  tax  year  2012,  Applicant  was  aware  when  he  filed  the  return  that  he  owed
$9,800. (GE 2 at 6; GE 3 at 3; Tr. 62-63)
For  federal  tax  year  2013,  Applicant  owed  $23,000.  He  recalled  resuming  his
second employment during that year. He was a W-2 employee at both jobs and he was
aware taxes were being withheld from both jobs. Applicant did not take any action at the
time  to  change  his  withholding  or  exemptions  to  prevent  the  dramatic  increase  in  tax
liability, but he did not think his tax liability would be that high.  Unable to pay the 2013
federal  incomes  taxes,  Applicant  and  his  wife  decided  to  enroll  in  a  repayment  plan
eventually. Despite entries that show installment plans were established for federal tax
year 2013, the only plan with documented payments is the plan that began in November
2020. (GE 2 at 6; GE 3 at 3; Tr. 63-67)
Applicant  owed  $69,000  in  income  tax  for  federal  tax  year  2014,  because  he
obtained an early withdrawal of between $100,000 and $110,000 from his and his wife’s
401(k) account to pay the down payment on his current home. He was unaware that the
early  withdrawal from his 401(k) account  would  be taxed  as extra  income.  He  thought
that after you pay the taxes  and penalties, there  was no additional tax consequences.
When  he  filed  his  2014  federal  tax  return  in  2015,  he  discovered  that  the  401(k)
withdrawal  was  taxed  as  extra  income.  Again,  Applicant  mentioned  an  IRS  payment
plan.  However,  the  only  active  installment  plan  was  the  one  activated  in  November
2020. (GE 2 at 6; GE 3 at 3; Tr. 72-74)
Applicant surmised that the $55,000 in federal taxes he owed for tax year 2015
was  due  to  having  two  jobs  and  selling  their  first  home  in  2012  by  a  short-sale,  and
renting for two years before they purchased their current home. Applicant filed the 2015
federal tax return in January 2017. The reason for the late filing was because of the time
he  ended  his  work  day  at  his  second  job.  Though  he  also  claimed  that  collecting  tax
documentation extended the time it  took to prepare his 2015 return, he conceded that
the documents he was seeking were provided to him electronically or by mail so that he
could file his tax return on time. In 2016, Applicant advised his wife to file the 2015 tax
returns, but because of her job, raising two children, and tending to their home, she was
unable to prepare the 2015 return. (GE 2 at 6; GE 3 at 3; Tr. 74-80)
In 2017, Applicant  did not file his 2016 federal  tax return on time because his
tax preparer indicated that to correct everything, the filing would cost Applicant $10,000.
He did not have the money so he began discussing his tax issues with a new preparer,
but he still did not file his 2016 returns on time because he did not have the $6,205 he
owed  the  IRS  and  cost  for  tax  services  of  the  new  preparer,  and  getting  “everything”
(presumably documentation) to him in anticipation of  enrolling in an IRS  payment plan
requiring payments of about $3,000 a month. (GE 2 at 6; Tr. 80-82)
Applicant filed the federal tax returns for 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 on June
30, 2020, because he knew the returns had to be filed. (GE 3 at 3) The reason for the
delay was that  he finally completed his review of  the voluminous paperwork  under the
restrictions caused by the pandemic. He did not think that the delinquent federal taxes
would  be  a  problem  as  long  as  he  had  a  repayment  plan  in  place.  He  stressed  his
honest  disclosures  about  the  delinquent  taxes  to  the  OPM  investigator.  (If  he  was
referring to the interview with the  OPM investigator, the May 2019 PSI and  June 2020
interrogatory  answers  were  submitted  before  he  entered  the  repayment  plan  in
November 2020.) Apparently, the fact that he was going to receive a refund for federal
tax  years  2017,  2018,  and  2019,  instilled  additional  assurance  that  there  would  be  no
security clearance issue. He also testified about his desire to negotiate a payment plan
with the IRS that called for more manageable payments of $2,400, instead of $3,000 a
month installment package connected to his 2016 federal tax return. (Tr. 85-87)
Applicant filed his 2016 through 2019 state tax returns on June 30, 2020,
the same day he filed his federal returns. He owed $4,257 the state tax agency for tax
year 2015 and $7,644 for tax year 2014. He knew he owed the state income taxes when
he filed the returns. Applicant claimed that the security clearance investigation was not
one of the reasons he filed the state and federal returns in June 2020. (GE 2 at 8; Tr.
87-88)
Applicant’s  rental  property,  which  he   purchased   for  $219,00,  is  currently
worth  about $180,000.  He is trying  to  sell  the  rental  before the  15-year adjustable-rate-
mortgage (ARM) becomes due in March 2022.  (Tr. 88-89)
Concerning earnings for Applicant and his wife, he takes home about $8,000 a
month. His wife earns a little over $5,000 a month. He and his wife still have $105,000
in the 401(k) account he took an early withdrawal from in 2014. (Tr. 101-102)
Regarding  Applicant’s  expenses,  his  mortgage  is  $4,500  a  month,  which
includes  property  taxes,  insurance,  and  escrow.  The  first  mortgage  on  the  rental
property  is  $1,030  a  month  and  the  second  is  $265  a  month.  He  and  his  wife  make
monthly payments on four credit cards. Applicant’s credit card  balance  is $18,000, and
he pays $400 on the card every month. His wife’s total balance on three credit cards is
about $17,500. Since he pays for all the credit cards, his monthly payments amount to
$900. He pays $166 a month in car insurance for two cars. He has been paying $700 a
month  on  a  time  share  since  2015.  He  purchased  the  timeshare  in  2003  when  the
monthly fee was lower. Applicant has not used the timeshare in the last few years and
has not taken any other vacations in the last two. (Tr. 95-104)
To  prevent  similar  financial  problems  from  recurring  in  the  future,
Applicant intends to remain employed with his current employer who offers no benefits
last
like paid time off (PTO). He plans to forego future vacations as he has
few  years.  He  receives  a  free  meal for  delivering  meals  to  the  elderly.  Working  under
telework regulations since the beginning of the pandemic in  March 2020, has reduced
the
in
expenses.  Applicant  believes  he   incurred   the   large   tax   dilemma   because:  (1)  he   was
working   two   jobs;  (2)  he   had   limited   to   time   to   interact  with   his  children;  and,  (3)  he
wanted  to  settle  his family  into  a  dwelling  where his family  had  space  to  thrive.  (Tr. 108-
113)
Character Evidence
On  October  20,  2021,  reference  JR  indicated  that  she  known  Applicant  for  27
years  and  taught  him  history  in  high  school.  In  subsequent  years,  she  observed  him
become as  good husband, father, and  citizen.  His  entire family is active  in  church.  JR
believes Applicant is security conscious. (AE E1) AE E2 contains a blank page followed
a copy of JR’s AE E1 reference.
In  a  statement  dated  October  21,  2021,  RN  expressed  that  Applicant  attended
her high school. In recent years they have resumed their friendship. RN knows that he
is  supportive  of  his  children’s  sport  and  church  activities.  He  has  demonstrated  his
trustworthiness by caretaking her home when she is away. Applicant does not display a
flashing lifestyle despite his good income. (AE 3)
Reference RW has known Applicant for 30 years, partially because he and
RW’s  son  attended  the  same  high  school.  RW  believes  Applicant  has  always
displayed  goal-oriented  behavior  that  has  worked  hand-in-hand  with  his
dependability.
