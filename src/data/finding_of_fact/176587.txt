Applicant is a  38-year-old employee  of  a  government contractor.  He  has  worked
for his current employer since  about  January  2018.  He  attended  high  school from  1998
until  2002   but  did   not   earn  a   diploma.  In   2016,  he  received   a   certificate   in  aviation
mechanics.  He also attended  classes full  time  at  two  other trade  schools between  2014
and   2017,  but  did  not   earn  a   certificate   or  degree.   He   served   on   active   duty   with   the
U.S.  Air   Force   for   about   10   years  until   2013   when   he   received   a   general   discharge
under honorable  conditions.  He  received   this   discharge   because   he   was  charged   with
driving   under  the   influence   of  alcohol  in   February   2013.   He   was  twice  deployed   to
combat zones during  his military  service.  He  was married  in 2008  and  divorced  in 2013.
He has been  living  with  a  cohabitant since  2016  and  has been  engaged  to  marry  her as
of  late  2021.  He  has five  children  with  three different women.  At  least four  of his  children
are minors for whom  he  is financially  responsible.  He  was  unemployed  from  about 2013
until January  2018.  He  briefly  held one  temporary  job  for about four months in 2015. He
claimed   that  he   was  looking   for   work   throughout   this  period   of   unemployment.

The  SOR  alleges
that  Applicant  has  seven  delinquent  debts
totaling
approximately  $91,000.  These  delinquencies  consist  of  child  support  payments  (SOR
¶¶  1.a and 1.b), an  automobile  loan  (SOR ¶  1.c),  a  government overpayment  (SOR  ¶
1.d), and telecommunications debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g). Approximately $69,000
of  the  delinquent  debt  in  the  SOR  is  for  unpaid  child  support  in  State  A  and  State  B.
Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  and  1.e  through  1.g,  with
additional comment. He denied the SOR debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d.  His admissions
are adopted as findings of fact. (Tr. 30-46, 50-61; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-6;
AE A)
The  child  support  debts  to  State  A  and  State  B  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b
have been resolved. Applicant testified that he brought these accounts current through
payments  and  by  taking  custody  of  the  two  children  for  whom  the  payments  were
provided after his ex-wife passed away in April 2021. Both State A and State B forgave
any  back  child  support  owed  in  2021  when  Applicant  took  sole  custody  of  the  two
children.  Applicant  provided  documentary  evidence  from  States  A  and  B  that  these
accounts are current. He first fell behind on these payments because he was unable to
find employment after he  left the military. However, he began repaying the debts once
he  started  his  current  job  in  January  2018.  (Tr.  30-39,  50,  57-59,  61;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1-6; AE A)
The  $20,068  charged-off  automobile  loan  listed  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  has  not  been
resolved. The creditor charged off this debt in July 2013. The debt became delinquent
because  Applicant  received  a  demotion  in  rank in  2013  and  lost  a  significant  portion  of
his  salary.   He   believed   his  ex-wife   was  responsible   for   this  loan.  He  testified   that  she
took  the   car  after  their   divorce,   but  in  his  2018   clearance   interview,  he   stated   that   he
was in possession  of the  vehicle  that secured  the  debt when  it was repossessed.  He  did
not  initially  try  to  make  payment  arrangement  on  this debt  because  he  believed   his ex-
wife  was responsible  for it. After learning  that he  was responsible  for the  debt,  in 2016
or 2017,  he  claimed  that he  contacted  the  creditor but  he  could  not  afford to  make  the
payments they  were requiring, so  he  gave  up. He presented  no  documentary  evidence
that   he   has   made   a   payment,  disputed   this  debt,   offered   or   negotiated   a   payment
agreement,   or  taken   any   significant   actions  to   resolve   this   debt.   The   debt  appears  on
the  2017  and  2019  credit reports but  not on  the  2021  and  2022  credit reports.  (Tr. 39-
41; Applicant’s response to  SOR; GE  2, 3, 4)
The  $536  government  overpayment  debt  listed  in  SOR  ¶  1.d  has  not  been
resolved.  During his clearance  interview,  Applicant  stated  that he was  unaware  of  this
debt. He stated in his response to the SOR that he was unaware of the debt and denied
it because the government had not properly communicated to  let him know he owed it.
He  initially  testified  at  his  hearing  that  he  was  unaware  of  this  debt.  However,  he
subsequently testified that this debt was likely for an overpayment for moving expenses
while he was still in the military.  He claimed that he contacted his former military base
several times in 2013 after he became aware of the debt to resolve it, but no one could
help  him  with  a  resolution,  so  he  stopped  trying.  Given  that  he  took  these  efforts  to
resolve the debt in 2013, he must have been aware of it during his clearance interview,
when  he  responded  to  the  SOR,  and  at  hearing.  Regardless,  he  presented  no
documentary  evidence  that  he  has  made  a  payment,  disputed  this  debt,  offered  or
negotiated a payment agreement, or taken any significant actions to  resolve  this debt.
The debt appears on the 2017 and 2019 credit reports, but not on the 2021 and 2022
credit reports. The latest activity date listed on the 2017 and 2019 credit reports is 2014.
(Tr. 41-43; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-4)
The  $222  and  $133  telecommunications  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.e  and  1.f,
respectively, have not been resolved. Applicant fell behind on these debts because he
was not earning enough money to pay them and prioritized other expenses. He claimed
that he paid the debt listed in SOR ¶ 1.e and he believed his fiancée paid the debt listed
in  SOR  ¶  1.f.  He  did  not  provide  documentation  to  corroborate  that  he  or  his  fiancée
paid these debts. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.e appears on the 2017 and 2019 credit reports
but not on the 2021 or 2022 credit reports.  The 2017 and 2019 credit reports reflect a
2012 activity date for the debt listed in SOR ¶ 1.e. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.f appears on the
2019 and 2021 credit reports, but not on the 2022 credit report. The 2019 credit report
reflects a 2018 activity date for the debt listed in SOR ¶ 1.f. The 2021 credit report does
not list an activity date. (Tr. 43-45, 59-60; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5)
The $649 telecommunications debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g has not been resolved.
Applicant became delinquent on this debt when he moved from State A to State B and
did not return the  creditor’s equipment.  He claimed that he arranged for  the creditor to
forgive his debt by using the same equipment when he set up another account with the
same  creditor  in  State  B.  He  did  not  provide  any  documentation  to  corroborate  the
existence  of  this  agreement  with  the  creditor  or  the  resolution  of  this  debt.  This  debt
appears on the 2017 credit report with an action date of 2013, but it does not appear on
the 2019, 2021, or 2022 credit reports. (Tr. 45-47, Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2,
3)
Applicant had two additional delinquent debts not listed in the SOR that appeared
on  the  2022  credit  report.1  These  delinquencies  were  rental  debts  for  $1,631  and
$5,201,  respectively.  Applicant  claimed  that  he  paid  these  debts.  He  provided
corroborating documentation that he paid the first of these rental debts in May 2022 and
the other in June 2022. (Tr. 16-20, 23-24; GE 5, 6; AE A)
With   the   exception   of   the   four  months  that   he   held  a   temporary   job   in  2015,
Applicant  earned   approximately   $1,200  per month  through   the   G.I.  Bill   while   attending
school   from   2014   through   2018.   He   currently   earns   approximately   $5,700   in  gross
income  per month.  His fiancée  was recently  laid  off, is looking  for another job, and  is in
the  process  of applying  for unemployment  benefits.  Applicant testified  that he  was  able
to  make  payments  on  his  debts because  of the  income  she  was providing  prior to  being
laid  off.  He  has  no  savings account,  but  testified that he  has  “about five  grand  just  sitting
around.”  He claimed  that he  earns enough  money  to  save  each  month  and  that he  and
his fiancée follow  a  written  budget.  He has  not  received any financial  counseling.  (Tr.47-
49, 56-57;  GE 2)
Applicant  presented  two  character-reference  letters.  One  was  from  a  co-worker
and the other from a long-time friend. The friend holds a security clearance and works
for a U.S. Senator as a military/veteran liaison. Both of these individuals think Applicant
should be entrusted with a security clearance and cite to how well he takes care of his
children  and  his  understanding  of  the  importance  of  family.  They  also  attest  to
Applicant’s  strong  work  ethic  and  his  ability  to  rebound  from  the  difficult  situation
involving his ex-wife and her untimely passing. (AE A)
