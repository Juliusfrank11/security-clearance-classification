Applicant  is  a  70-year-old  vice  president  of  a  company  doing  business  as  a
defense contractor, a position he has held since May 2018.  He has a master’s degree
that he earned in 1974. He is also a 1977 law school graduate and an attorney. He has
been  a  member  of  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  Auxiliary  since  2001.  He  is  married  with  an
adult child. (Tr. at 6, 13; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1; AE E-K)
The SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling about $49,300. The debts consist
of  three  consumer  accounts  totaling  about  $23,533  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and  1.c);  two
medical debts totaling $200 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e); and a defaulted $25,573 student loan
(SOR ¶ 1.f). All of the debts are listed on a May 2019 credit report.
Applicant  worked  at  a  law  firm  from  2010  to  2018.  The  law  firm  paid  bonuses,
which was often the largest part of the compensation, once a year. This left the partners
and  employees  struggling  for  the  rest  of  the  year.  His  compensation  also  decreased
about $20,000 to $25,000 at one point. He left the law firm to take his current job. He is
also  an  adjunct  professor  at  two  law  schools  and  a  college.  (GE  1,  2;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; AE K)
Applicant  and  his  wife  were  primarily  responsible  for  their  elderly  parents.  His
father passed away in about 2008, and his father-in-law passed away in 2011. Applicant
and  his  wife  also  traveled  extensively  to  the  state  where  his  mother  lived,  before  he
moved  his  mother  to  be  closer  to  him  in  2012.  Applicant  had  a  financial  plan  for  his
mother through 95, but  she outlived his plan,  resulting in out-of-pocket expenses. She
passed away at 102 in 2018. There were also expenses related to traveling to care for
his mother-in-law. She passed away in 2017. Applicant and his wife  also paid for their
child to go to college from 2008 to 2012. (Tr. at 14-15; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE
2; AE K)
Applicant stated that he was making regular payments to the bank for the $4,781
charged-off  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  until  2014,  when  the  creditor  stopped  sending
monthly  statements.  His  wife  handles  the  family’s  finances.  He  stated  that  she
unsuccessfully attempted to contact the creditor to arrange payments. The debt is listed
by  all  three  credit  reporting  agencies  on  the  May  2019  combined credit  report with  an
activity date of May 2019. The debt is not listed on the June 2022 Experian credit report
submitted by Applicant. (Tr. at 44-48; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE L)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  a  $16,742  airline  miles  charged-off  credit  card.  Applicant
stated that, like the previous debt, the creditor stopped sending monthly statements. He
wrote  in  his  response  to  the  SOR:  “my  wife  and  I  were  fully  prepared  to  pay  off  this
obligation, but in the last several years have never received any bill, communication or
other response, including to whom and to where payments should be made”. The debt
is listed by all three credit reporting agencies on the May 2019 combined credit report
with  an  activity date  of  March  2015. The  debt  is not  listed  on  the June 2022 Experian
credit report. (Tr. at 48-50; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE L)
Applicant  admitted  owing  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c,  but  he  stated  the
amount owed was $1,882 and not $2,010. He reported the debt on a Questionnaire for
National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  he  submitted  in  January  2019,  with  the  comment:
“paying off the obligation at $69.11/month.” He told an investigator during his June 2019
interview that he believed the account had been satisfied. He repeated that claim during
a  telephonic  follow-up  interview  in  July  2019.  (Tr.  at  50-53;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  testified  that  the  debt  was  sold  to  a  collection  company  in  2019.  He
was offered the option of paying $77 per month for 24 months. He made one payment
in September 2019, but he “never received any subsequent payment coupons or other
written  communication  from  [collection  company],  despite  [his]  attempts  to  continue
payments.”  He  stated  that  the  collection  company  occasionally  contacts  them  by
telephone,  insisting on payments  through  a credit  or debit  card,  or online by providing
access  information for their  checking  account.  He  “refused  to  do  either  out  of  security
concerns.” His position  is: “if  they want their  money, they can jolly well send us any of
that  and  we’ll  gladly  reinstitute  payments.”  The  letter from  the  collection  company  has
an 800 number and a website that accepts payments. The debt is not listed on the June
2022 Experian credit report. (Tr. at 50-53; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE L)
Applicant  denied  owing  the  two  medical  debts  totaling  $200  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and
1.e). The debts are not identified and do not appear on the 2022 credit report. (Tr. at 5;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3: AE L)
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  a  defaulted  $25,573  student  loan  that  was  taken  out  for
Applicant’s child’s education. Applicant stated that the loan was consistently and timely
paid “until the lender suddenly and without notice charged it off.” The debt is listed by all
three credit reporting agencies on the May 2019 combined credit report with an activity
date of February 2015. The bank holding the loan issued an Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) Form 1099-C (Cancellation of Debt) in 2019, which cancelled Applicant’s $13,885
debt.  Applicant asserted  that  they were  paying the  loan, as  evidenced  by the  $13,885
figure as opposed to $25,573. However, creditors are not obligated to include interest,
and if they do, it is required to be reported.1  The 1099-C did not report any interest. (Tr.
at 57-63; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE L)
Applicant   and   his  wife   have   received   financial  counseling.  She   handles  the
family’s  finances.  He  believes  she   keeps  an   informal  budget.   She   works  ten   hours  a
week.  In   addition   to   his  salary,  he   receives  Social  Security   benefits  and   the   pay   for
being  an  adjunct professor at  two  law  schools and  a  college. He  recently  refinanced  the
mortgage  for the  house  he  has lived  in since  1997.  None  of the  SOR debts are listed  on
the  June  2022  Experian  credit report submitted  by  Applicant. Except for the  SOR debts,
his finances  are  in  order.  He  has $86,321  in federal stu
dent loans  that are on  pause  due
to   relief   granted   for  the   COVID-19   pandemic.  The   original  amount  borrowed   was
$48,594,  so   a   fair   amount   of  the   balance   is  interest.   Applicant   stated   that  with   his
1 See https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099ac.
refinanced mortgage, he is willing and able to pay the student loans when the pause is
ended. (Tr. at 63-75; AE A-D, K-O)
The  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Applicant’s  employer  has  known
him  professionally  and  personally  for  about  26  years.  He  attested  to  Applicant’s
excellent job performance and strong moral character. He recommended Applicant for a
security clearance. (Tr. at 17-41)
