Applicant  admitted  both  of  the  SOR  allegations  in  her  Answer.  She  is  40  years
old,  single,  and  has  a  minor  child.  As  of  the  date  of  the  DCS  VTC  hearing,  she
cohabitated with her fiancé of three years since 2010. (Answer; Tr. at 13-15, 23; GE 1;
AE L)
Applicant graduated from high school in 1999. She earned an associate’s degree
in 2001, a bachelor’s degree in 2003, and a master’s degree in 2008. As of the date of
the  hearing,  she  worked  as  an  engineer  for  her  employer,  a  DOD  contractor,  since
2010. She was first granted access to sensitive information in 2009. (Tr. at 5-6, 15-16,
51-52; GE 1; AE D, E, F)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  failed  to  pay  her  federal  income  taxes,  as
required,  for  tax  years  (TY)  2012  through  2018,  and  she  owed  the  U.S.  Government
approximately $17,685 in unpaid taxes for those tax years (SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.b). The SOR
allegations  are  established  by  Applicant’s  admissions  in  her  Answer,  her  December
2018  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  her  adopted  2019  background  interviews,
and her July 2020 response to interrogatories. (Tr. at 16-19; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  attributed  her  failure  to  pay  her  federal  income  taxes  for  TY  2012
through  2018  to  her  inability  to  pay  due  to  minimal  income.  After  she  and  her  fiancé
relocated in 2010, her fiancé had difficulty finding employment, and she was the primary
breadwinner. She prioritized their basic living expenses, to include child care. Her fiancé
worked  for many years in  a  part time or temporary capacity,  and he  obtained full-time
employment in approximately 2017. (Tr. at 16-32, 45-46; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  indicated  in  her  April  2019  background  interview  that  she  established
an  installment  agreement  with  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  in  2013  of  $190
monthly, to resolve her outstanding taxes. In her July 2020 response to interrogatories,
she provided documentation reflecting that she made the following payments to the IRS
for her outstanding taxes: (1) four payments totaling $546 between May 2018 and July
2020 for TY 2012; (2) a payment of $149 in May 2018 for TY 2018; and (3) a payment
of $149 in June 2020 for TY 2020. In 2020, the IRS revised her installment agreement
to  $262  monthly.  Due  to  financial  assistance  from  her  mother,  in  part,  she  made
additional  payments  to  the  IRS  of  approximately  $3,612  and  $1,296  toward  TY  2012
and 2013 in November 2020, respectively, and $1,000 and $764 in March 2021 toward
TY 2013 and 2018, respectively. (Tr. at 16-32, 38-44, 48, 51-52; GE 1, 2; AE A, B, C, G,
H, M, N)
IRS  tax  account  transcripts  from  December  2020  and  August  2021  reflect  that
Applicant  paid  her  outstanding  taxes  for  TY  2012  and  2013,  and  she  paid  down  her
outstanding  taxes  for  TY  2018  from  $837  to  $754.  She  testified  that  all  of  her  federal
and  state  income  taxes  had  been  filed  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing;  she  owed  an
unrecalled amount in taxes for TY 2019, which was included in her monthly installment
agreement  with  the  IRS;  and  she  intends  to  continue  paying  her  outstanding  taxes
through  that  agreement.  She  provided  documentation  reflecting  that  as  of  September
2021,  she  owed  the  IRS  a  total  of  $11,537,  and  she  was  current  on  her  monthly
payments. (Tr. at 16-32, 38-44, 48, 51-52; GE 1, 2; AE A, B, C, G, H, M, N)
Applicant testified that she received financial counseling online in approximately
2020. She also intends to consult with a tax advisor. She provided a copy of her budget,
reflecting a total monthly household income of  $6,700 and a  monthly net remainder of
approximately $1,481, which provides her with sufficient disposable income to meet her
financial  obligations.  Her  annual  performance  reviews  reflect  that  her  employer  rated
her performance as “[c]onsistently  meets expectations”  from  2017  to  2019  and  “strong
performance”  in  2020,  and  her  employer  gave  her  a  star  award  in  appreciation  of  her
efforts on a project in April 2021. A co-worker of over 10 years described Applicant as
reliable, professional, and trustworthy. (Tr. at 23, 32-38, 41, 46-51; GE 2; AE D, I, J, K,
