Applicant is a  37-year old married  woman  with  three  pre-teen  children. Applicant
earned  an  associate  degree  in 2006  and  a  bachelor’s degree  in 2008. (Item  3  at 11) She
has been  working  for her current employer as a  program  control analyst since  February
2011. (Item 3  at 13; Item 4 at 2)
Applicant incurred 11 debts, totaling approximately $39,000, as alleged in the SOR.
Applicant  attributes  incurring  these  debts  to  spending  beyond  her  means  and  in  a
financially irresponsible manner using credit cards. (Item 4 at 9) Applicant contends that
the  debts  alleged  in  subparagraph  1.b  and  1.e,  as  well  as  those  in  1.c  and  1.d  are
duplicative; however, she provided no evidence. (Item 2 at 2) Also, she contends that she
satisfied the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, and 1.g, totaling $27,000. (Item 2
at 2) She provided no documentary evidence.
Applicant did not disclose any delinquent debts, as required, on her February 2020
security clearance application. (Item 3 at 33-34) During her April 2020 subject interview,
she was asked whether she had any delinquent debts and again failed to acknowledge any
such debts to the investigator before being presented with proof of the delinquencies on
her credit report. (Item 4 at 4) When the agent showed her the credit report containing
these delinquencies, Applicant explained that she omitted the information because there
was no place to enter it on the security clearance application. (Item 4 at 5) In her answer,
she explained that she omitted the information because she “went through these specific
questions too fast” when completing the application. (Item 2 at 3)
