In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted both allegations, with explanations
(contained in the attachment to his answer). I have incorporated those admissions into
my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and
exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  47  years  old.  He  was  awarded  a  bachelor’s  degree.  He  is  married
and  he  has  two  children,  ages  14  and  17.  He  volunteers  in  his  community  and  has
coached  youth  soccer.  He  is  a  consultant  to  several  Government  agencies,  including
the  DOD.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  since  2016  (his  current  employer
acquired the company who hired him in 2016). He was granted a security clearance in
2016, after completing his security clearance application (SCA) in July 2016. (Tr. 6, 21,
29-30; GE 1)
The SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from 2014 to
about 2019, and he used marijuana, with varying frequency, from about 2016 to about
2019, while holding a security clearance. (See SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.b.)
Applicant  credibly  testified  that  his  marijuana  use  was  very  limited.  While  he
admitted  using  recreationally  in  college,  his  2014  to  2019  uses  were  all  due  to  his
decision to use marijuana rather than prescribed opioids to manage his pain after four
oral surgery procedures during that timeframe. His first two oral surgeries were in 2010
or  2011  and  2014  timeframe,  and  he  took  the  prescribed  opioid  pain  medicine.  He
became  concerned  about  the  addictive  effect  of  these  drugs  and  talked  to  his doctors
about  alternative  pain  management,  including  using  marijuana.  His  third  oral  surgery
was in 2016, after he filled out his SCA in July 2016. He admitted using marijuana rather
than opioids for pain management after this surgery. He lives in a state where marijuana
use is legal under state law. He did not list his marijuana use on the SCA because, he
believed  his use  was legal under state  law and  the  question  asked  about “illegal”  drug
usage.  Even  though  he  did  not  have  to  do  so,  Applicant  applied  for  and  received  a
medical  marijuana  card.  He  only  used  marijuana  after  the  dental  surgeries  for  pain
management. He did not use it recreationally. (Tr. 22-24, 36, 38; GE 2; AE A)
Applicant  testified  that  sometime  in  2018  he  first  became  aware  that  using
marijuana violated federal law and was advised by a coworker that he should report his
previous uses to his employer. Later in 2018, Applicant believed he self-reported to his
employer  his  marijuana  pain-management  use  after  his  2016  surgery.  (Tr.  39,  42-43;
GE 2, AE A)
In  2019,  Applicant  had  a  fourth  oral  surgery.  He  once  again  used  marijuana
rather  the  opioids  for  pain  management  after  the  surgery.  This  was  the  last  time
Applicant used marijuana. While he has not informed his employer about this marijuana
use, during his January 2020 background investigation, he disclosed this information to
the  investigator.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  was  confused  as  to  what  his  obligations
were regarding the prohibition on marijuana use given the legality differences between
federal  and  state  jurisdictions.  He  admitted  that  he  did  not  seek  clarification  from  his
facilities security officer or other company officials. (Tr. 25, 27, 41-42, 44-45)
Applicant  provided  a  signed  statement  indicating  his  intent  not  to  use  illegal
drugs,  including  marijuana  in  the  future.  He  expects  to  have  at  least  one  more  oral
surgery  in  the  future,  but  he  will  not  use  marijuana  for  pain  management  after  that
procedure. He will talk with his doctors about other pain management options and if he
has to, he will take the prescribed opioids. (Tr. 46, 49; AE B)
