In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) He
also provided mitigating information. (Id.) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 57-year-old engineering technician II who has worked for a defense
contractor for three years. (Tr. 7, 9; GE 1) In 1984, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 7)
He has never served in the military. (Tr. 7) He was married in 1987 and divorced in 1991.
(GE 1 at 22) His two children were born in 1987 and 2004. (Id. at 25)
Financial Considerations
For several years, Applicant was paid cash for labor work without the information
being shared with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (Tr. 44-46) He has a history of not
filing tax returns because his refunds were going toward a child support debt, and he did
not believe this was fair because he was not permitted to see his daughter. (Tr. 31; GE 4
at  9)  His  child  support  debt  for  his  oldest  child  was  paid  in  2016.  (GE  2  at  14)  He
acknowledge that his handling of his taxes was not “the right thing to do.” (Tr. 31) Later,
after  his  child  support  was  paid,  he  failed  to  file  some  tax  returns  because  he  was
distracted  by  other  events  and  issues  in  his  life,  including  the  illness  and  death  of  his
father. (Tr. 32-33, 47-48)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant failed to file his federal income tax returns for TYs
2016 and 2018. Applicant said he was unable to find W-2s or other documents showing
his income for TY 2016. (SOR response, Ex. A) For TY 2016, he provided an IRS account

Applicant’s April 20, 2022 TY 2018 IRS tax transcript indicates his TY 2018 federal
income tax return was filed on May 4, 2020; however, his IRS processing date was May
3, 2021. (AE H at 1) On April 24, 2021, a duplicate return was filed. (Id.) When he filed
his TY 2018 federal tax return, he owed the IRS $739; however, he did not pay the IRS
$739 when he filed his TY 2018 tax return. (Tr. 25-30) His tax debt for TY 2018 was paid
with his federal income tax refunds for TYs 2020 and 2021, with the final payment being
made in April 2022. (Id. at 2; AE H at 1; AE G)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant failed to file as required his federal income tax return
for TY 2017. An IRS tax transcript shows his TY 2017 tax return was filed in April 2019.
(GE 3 at 13) He was due a $470 refund, and it was transferred to address a non-IRS debt.
(Id.)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant failed to file as required his state income tax returns

(SOR  response,  Ex.  C  at  1)  For  TYs  2017  and  2018,  he  provided  copies  of  his  state
income tax returns; however, they were not signed or dated. (Id.) His tax return preparer

he filed his TY 2017 and 2018 state tax returns around April 2021. (Tr. 35)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges Applicant owes past-due state income taxes of $5,900 for TYs
1991, 1992, 2008, 2009, 2013, and 2014. His July 14, 2020 state tax account summary
indicates he owes a total of $5,901 for the following six TYs: 1991 ($168); 1992 ($1,650);
2008 ($3,630); 2009 ($2,772); 2013 ($590); and 2014 ($557). (GE 2 at 11) His May 17,

Ex. E at 2) He also paid a non-SOR medical debt for $115. (Tr. 39-40; Id.)
The IRS received Applicant’s federal income  tax return for TY  2019  on  May 18,
2020, and for TY 2020 on May 10, 2021. (AE H at 5, 6) His TY 2020 federal income tax
return indicates he had itemized deductions of $12,400 and his TY 2021 federal income
tax return indicates he had itemized deductions of $12,550; however, he did not provide
a copy of his Schedule As for those two TYs. (AE I at 1, 5) He self-prepared his federal
income tax returns for TYs 2020 and 2021. (AE I at 2, 6) He is credited with timely filing
his state and federal income tax returns for TYs 2020 and TY 2021. (Tr. 41-42; AE H at
3, 8; AE I at 1-9) He received a $42 refund in May 2022 for TY 2021 and the remainder
of his refund was used to pay his tax debt for TY 2018. The $42 refund is an indication all
of his federal income taxes are current. (AE H at 3, 9)
On  April  25,  2022,  Applicant’s  program  manager
lauded  his  diligence,
responsibility,  and  potential  for  future  contributions  to  his  employer.  (AE  F)  He  was
promoted  to  engineering  technician  II,  and  he  is  likely  to  be  promoted  to  positions  of
greater responsibility in the future. (Id.)
