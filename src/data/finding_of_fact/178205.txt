Applicant is 52 years old. He was married in November 1990 and divorced in May
2008. Applicant has two adult children. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from
November  1988  until  his  honorable  discharge  in  May  2000.  Applicant  studied  nursing
from September 2006 until April 2008 and became a licensed practical nurse (LPN) in
June  2008.  Applicant  seeks  eligibility  to  occupy  a  position  of  public  trust,  because  his
employer and sponsor provides services to the Department of Defense, and his job would
involve access to sensitive but unclassified information. Applicant has been employed by
his sponsor since September 2019. (Items 3 and 4.)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged  10 delinquent debts  (totaling $14,402) and
one Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing in October 2013 that was discharged in January 2014.
(Item  1.)  Applicant  admitted  those  allegations.  He  also  admitted  that  he  filed  another
Chapter 7 in November 2021. (Item 2.) The recent bankruptcy is not alleged in the SOR.
(Item 1.)
When Applicant divorced in 2008, he lost the income of his spouse.  Applicant tried
to pay all of his bills, but he fell behind. Applicant also had to pay $200 per month child
support for his then minor children. That led to his first bankruptcy, in 2013. Applicant lost
his job in about 2018 and had a period of unemployment (dates not specified). The jobs t
Applicant could find paid less than he needed. Due to Covid pandemic health concerns,
job  opportunities  became  more  limited.  Because  of  a  service-related  injury,  Applicant
could not take some jobs that required him to stand for long periods of time. He hopes to
qualify for some disability benefits. Applicant is unsure when that might happen. There is
no  evidence  that  Applicant  made  any  payments,  established  any  payment  plans,  or
contacted his creditors. (Items 2 and 4.)
