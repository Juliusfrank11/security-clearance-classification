Applicant  admitted  some  of  the SOR  allegations,  with  explanations,  and  denied
other allegations. Her admissions are incorporated into these findings of fact. Applicant
denied  all  the  ASOR  allegations.  Although  she  “admitted”  ASOR  ¶  2.c,  her  narrative
explanation  makes  it  clear  that  she  is  denying  any  deliberate  or  intentional  false  or
misleading statements. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She began working at
her present job in March 2019. Aside from a one-month period of unemployment in 2013,
she  has  worked  in  the  information  technology  (IT)  area  since  2001,  including  work for
other federal contractors. She is a high school graduate with some college credits. She
was married for the fifth time in 2018 (previous marriages were from: 1984-1987, 1993-
2001,  2007-2012,  2015-2018).  She  has  three  adult  children.  She  has  held  a  security
clearance since 2013. (Tr. at 22-23, 41-42, GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  17  delinquent  debts  including  vehicle  repossessions,  medical
and consumer debts totaling $45,156. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.q) The debts were listed in credit
reports from May 2019, September 2020, and December 2021. (GE 9-11)
Under Guideline F, the ASOR alleged, in May 2017, Appellant’s company’s board
of directors (BD) removed her as a BD member for withdrawing $7,050 from the company
bank account without proper authorization. (SOR ¶ 1.r) This allegation was also crossed-
alleged  under  Guideline  E.  Additionally,  under  Guideline  E,  the  ASOR  alleged  that
Applicant falsified material facts in her April 2019 security clearance application (SCA), in
response to Section 13A, when she failed to state that she had been removed from her
company’s BD. Additionally, the ASOR alleged she falsified material facts when she failed
to list in her April 2019 SCA, in response to Section 28, that she was a party in a civil
lawsuit within the last seven years. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.c)
In response to the allegations in the original SOR, Applicant credibly explained that
her financial difficulties resulted from several factors, including unexpected medical bills
from her cancer diagnosis and from severe leg and arm injuries requiring surgery due to
an  accident.  The  accident  left  her  wheelchair  bound  for  several  months.  She  also
admitted that she made some bad financial decisions when she helped finance vehicles
for an  ex-husband who  let the  loans  go delinquent.  (Tr. at 23-27; A1 and attachments
(listed by Applicant as Items and Exhibits))
Applicant documented that she earns over $160,000 per year from her current job,
and  she  also  testified  that  she  is  working  a  second  IT  job,  which  also  pays  her
approximately $160,000 per year as well. Her $320,000 total yearly income is more than
sufficient to pay her existing monthly bills and other debts as stated in her monthly budget.
She contributes to a retirement account that has approximately $14,000. She owns her
own home, which was purchased in 2021, and is current on her monthly payments. She
produced copies of her 2019 and 2020 federal tax returns where she received tax refunds.
(Tr. at 29, 55; A1 (Exhibits 1, 5, 10-13))
The status of his delinquent debts listed in the SOR is as follows:
Guideline F
Vehicle Repossession Deficiency-$12,558 (SOR ¶ 1.a). This debt was assigned
for collection in November 2012. The date of activity is July 2020. Applicant admitted that
she financed this vehicle for her ex-husband who agreed to make the payments. When
he did not, the vehicle was repossessed, sold, and resulted in a deficiency balance as
noted. When Applicant and this ex-husband divorced, she documented that the divorce
settlement ordered her ex-husband to pay this debt. He failed to do so. This debt is not
listed on her December 2021 credit report or her March 2022 credit report. Based upon
the date of activity, the information would not have been removed based upon the Federal
Trade  Commission  rules  that  restrict  reporting of  debts  over seven-years-old  on  credit
reports. (Tr. 23-24; GE 10, 11; A1 (Item A); AE A)
Vehicle Repossession Deficiency-$9,559 (SOR ¶ 1.b). This debt was assigned
for collection in April 2016. The date of last activity is August 2019. Applicant admitted
that  she  financed  this  vehicle  for  her  ex-husband  who  agreed  to  make  the  payments.
When he did not, the vehicle was repossessed, sold, and resulted in a deficiency balance
as noted. When Applicant and this ex-husband divorced, she documented that the divorce
settlement ordered her ex-husband to pay this debt. He failed to do so. She filed a dispute
letter with the creditor in September 2019. (Tr. 23-24; GE 11; A1 (Item B))
Medical Debt-$5,758 (SOR ¶ 1.c). Applicant credibly explained that this medical
debt resulted from surgery she had and that her insurance was supposed to pay the debt.
She is still working with her insurance company to resolve this issue. She contacted the
creditor to  work out  a payment plan,  but the creditor refused  any terms  other than full
payment. This debt is being resolved. (Tr. at 25-26; A1 (Item C))
School  Debt-$4,350  (SOR  ¶  1.d).  Applicant  credibly  explained  that  this  school
debt was from a cyber-security course she enrolled in and then later dropped because of
her busy schedule. Although she dropped the class before the deadline to be charged for
it, she was charged for the course. She disputed the charge with the school and the school
agreed to remove the charge. This debt was assigned to collections in December 2019
and the date of last activity was August 2020. This debt is not listed on her December
2021 credit report or her March 2022 credit report. Based upon the date of activity, the
information would not have been removed based upon the Federal Trade Commission
rules that restrict reporting of debts over seven-years-old on credit reports. This debt is
resolved. (Tr. at 26; GE 10, 11; A1 (item D))
Three Medical Debts assigned to the same collection company-$1,011; $681;
$180 (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.o). Applicant documented that she paid all three medical
debts in July 2019. These debts are resolved. (Tr. at 26; A1 (Items E, F, and O))
Medical Debt assigned to a collection company-$437 (SOR ¶ 1.g). Applicant
documented that she paid this medical debt in June 2019. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at
27; A1 (Item G))
Consumer Debt assigned to a collection company-$257 (SOR ¶ 1.h). Applicant
credibly testified that  she paid this debt. This debt  was  assigned to collections  in April
2020,  and  the  date  of  last  activity  was  August  2020.  This  debt  is  not  listed  on  her
December 2021 credit report or her March 2022 credit report. Based upon the date of
activity,  the  information  would  not  have  been  removed  based  upon  the  Federal Trade
Commission rules that restrict reporting of debts over seven-years-old on credit reports.
This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 27; A1)
Debt  assigned  to  a  collection  company-$152  (SOR  ¶  1.i).  Applicant
documented that she paid this medical debt in June 2019. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at
27; A1 (Item I))
Vehicle Repossession Deficiency-$8,108 (SOR ¶ 1.j). This debt was assigned
for collection in March 2017. The date of last activity is  June 2020. Applicant admitted
that  she  financed  this  vehicle  for  her  ex-husband  who  agreed  to  make  the  payments.
When he did not, the vehicle was repossessed, sold, and resulted in a deficiency balance
as noted. When Applicant and this ex-husband divorced, she documented that the divorce
settlement ordered her ex-husband to pay this debt. He failed to do so. She filed a dispute
letter with the creditor in September 2019. (Tr. 27; A1 (Items J and A))
Three Medical Debts assigned to the same collection company-$1,004; $432;
$192 (SOR ¶¶ 1.k, 1.l, and 1.n). Applicant documented that she paid all three medical
debts in June 2019. These debts are resolved. (Tr. at 27-28; A1 (Item K))
Two  Medical  Debts  assigned  to  the  same  collection  company-$213;  $175
(SOR ¶¶ 1.m and 1.p). Applicant documented that she paid both medical debts in June
2019. These debts are resolved. (Tr. at 27-28; A1 (Item P))
Debt assigned to a collection company-$89 (SOR ¶ 1.q). Applicant documented
that she paid this debt in June 2019. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 28; A1 (Item Q))
Regarding  the  ASOR  allegation  (SOR  ¶  1.r)  that  in  May  2017,  Applicant  was
removed  from  her  BD  position  of  her  company  by  the  other  BD  members,  Applicant
denied that she was properly removed by the BD because it had no authority to do so.
Applicant was in a legal dispute with the other BD members over several things, including
her being reimbursed for IT work she performed for the company, of which she was a 33
percent  owner.  Applicant,  with  the  consent  of  the  company  CEO,  wrote  herself  three
checks  (in  January,  February,  and  March  2017) totaling  $7,050  as  payment for her  IT
services she rendered to the company. In May the BD issued a resolution that Applicant
was to be removed as a BD member and that charges would be filed against Applicant
for embezzlement. The BD made a formal complaint to the local police department and a
police  report  was  issued.  No  criminal  charges  were  ever  filed  against  Applicant.
Additionally, she intervened in a pending civil lawsuit brought by another former company
employee against the company and the other BD members (except Applicant) seeking
summary judgment against the BD for its improper removal of her as a BD member. She
sought  to  have  the  BD’s  removal action  declared  null  and  void.  In  February  2018,  the
judge granted the motion and declared the BD’s action in removing Applicant from the BD
was without proper authority and therefore “null and void.” Applicant remained a member
of the BD. (Tr. at 31, 34-35; AE 12-13; AE B13-35, B39-42)
Guideline E
The relevant facts underlying SOR ¶ 2.a are stated above and will not be restated
here. Applicant stated that in response to the Section 13A allegation that she falsified her
April 2019 SCA regarding being fired or let go for cause from her employment, her answer
was correct because she remained a BD member after the judge’s ruling which nullified
the BDs action of removing her. Therefore, her SCA response to Section 13A was not
false or deliberately misleading. (Tr. at 35; AE B18-20)
Applicant admitted that she failed to document on her April 2019 SCA that she was
a party to a civil lawsuit. She stated that it was an oversight and not intentional. A review
of her April 2019 SCA, Section 13A, shows that when she described her relationship with
the company with whom she was a named party in a civil lawsuit, she stated “I did hire a
lawyer to collect my ownership interest.” In her July 2017 background interview with an
investigator,  Applicant  voluntarily  disclosed  her  contentious  relationship  with  her
company’s former CEO  and  stated  that  she  was  getting  an  attorney  to  file  against  the
CEO to get her share of the company. She also voluntarily disclosed the lawsuit during
her more recent background investigation in August 2019.
