Applicant is a 70-year-old employee of a government contractor. He has worked
for his current employer since about April 2019. From April 2019 until November 2019,
he was a contract employee. In November 2019, he became a permanent employee of
the  government  contractor.  He  has  bachelor’s  and  master’s  degrees.  He  has  been
married  since  1982.  He  has  three  adult  children.  Two  of  his  children  have  a
developmental  disorder,  and  are  fully  dependent  on  Applicant’s  financial  assistance.
Applicant has never held a security clearance, but has worked on sensitive matters as a
government  contractor.  Applicant  has  a  technical  and  scientific  background,  holds
numerous  U.S.  and  international  patents,  and  has  authored  dozens  of  scientific  and
technical publications. (Transcript (Tr.) 35-37; 46; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1.)
Applicant earns approximately  $130,000  annually  from  his  current  employer.  He
earned   about  $121,000   in   2020   and   about  $126,000   in   2021.   He   receives  $740   per
month   from   a   pension   from  a   former  employer.  He  also  receives  about  $2,600   per
month from  Social Security. Applicant’s wife  does not work, but receives about $990  per
month  from  social security.  Applicant currently  has a  surplus in  funds at the  end  of  each
month.  At  the  time  of the  hearing  he  had  between  $7,000  and  $8,000  total  in cash  and
in a  savings account.  Applicant has  about  $450,000  in assets, including  about  $420,000
in  equity   in  his  home.  From   about  2009   until  about  2018,  Applicant  worked   as  a
consultant  for   several companies, but   primarily   for Company   A.   From   about   2009  until
about 2015,   Applicant’s  earnings  from   Company   A   were   lucrative. For the  first   several
months,   Applicant   made   between   $5,000   to   $10,000   per  month,   but  that  amount
increased   to   about  $20,000   per   month   for  several  years.   In   about  2015,   Applicant
moved   at  his  own   expense   in   order  to   be   closer  to   Company   A’s  place   of  operation.
Beginning  shortly  after  his move  in 2015, Company  A  made  a  strategic change  in how
they   ran   their   business.  This  change   caused   Company   A’s  revenues  to   drop
dramatically,  and   consequently,  Applicant   began   making   far  less   money.   From   2016
until 2018, Applicant made  between  $10,000  and  $15,000  per year. He looked  for other
work but could not find employment  in his field until he started with his  current employer.
As  a   consultant,  he   was  ineligible  for unemployment benefits during   this time.   (Tr. 27-
29; 31-32; 44; 47-49; 50-52, 83-95;  Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A-C)
The SOR alleges that Applicant had ten delinquent debts totaling approximately
$72,000.  These  debts  consisted  of  telecommunications  debts,  credit  card  debts,  and
delinquent Federal taxes.  Approximately $36,000 of  the delinquent debt  in  the SOR  is
from unpaid taxes from the 2016 and 2017 tax years.  Applicant attributed the financial
delinquencies  to  not  having  enough  money  to  pay  his  bills  as  a  result  of  the
aforementioned lack of income and unexpected medical bills that his wife incurred after
suffering a fall in 2015. He also acknowledged that part of the reason he fell behind on
his  Federal  taxes  was  that  he  failed  to  account  for  the  amount  of  Federal  taxes  he
would  have  to  pay  from  his  earnings.  Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR  debts  with
additional  comment  in  his  response  to  the  SOR.  For  several  of  the  SOR  debts,  his
comments in his response to the SOR and his testimony make it clear that he does not
believe  he  owes  them.  Despite  his  admissions  in  his  SOR  response,  his  testimony
further  supports  these  disputes.  (Tr.  3,  40-45,  52-83,  97-99;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 1-5, 6; AE A-D)
The  $251  and  $682  telecommunications  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.g,
respectively,  have  not  been  resolved.  These  debts  were  originally  incurred  with  the
same  telecommunications  carrier.  While  Applicant  admitted  these  debts,  he  does  not
believe  that  he  owes  them.  When  Applicant  began  suffering  a  decline  in  income,  he
cancelled  his  accounts  with  this  creditor  to  save  money.  He  claimed  that  when  he
closed  these  accounts,  the  creditor  told  him  he  owed  them  no  money,  but  then  later
sent  him  a  bill.  He  has  the  funds  to  pay  the  accounts  but  does  not  want  to  do  so  on
principle because he thinks he has paid everything he owed on these accounts. He also
believes  he  does  not  owe  these  accounts  because  the  creditor  offered  him  the
opportunity  to  open  another  account  with  it.  Applicant  claimed  that  he  had  a  written
invitation  from  the  creditor  to  open  a  new  account,  but  he  did  not  provide  it.  He
presented no documentary evidence  that he has  made a  payment,  disputed this debt,
offered or negotiated a payment agreement, or taken any significant actions to resolve
this debt. These  debts  do  not  appear on  Applicant’s 2022  credit  report.  (Tr. 44-45, 73,
81-82, 98-99; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 4, 5; AE B, C)
The  credit card  debts  alleged  in SOR ¶¶  1.b,  1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and  1.h  have  not  been
resolved. In  his response  to  the  SOR, Applicant claimed  that  he  has not yet addressed
these   debts   because   he   has  been   addressing   other  debts.   At  his   hearing,  he   testified
that he  does not believe  that he  owes these  debts because  they  are  time  barred  by  the
statute   of  limitations   in   the   state   where  he   resides.   Applicant   also   did   not   attempt   to
resolve   these   debts   because   he   disagreed   with   the   interest   and   penalties  that  he
believed  were part of  the  balance,  and because  he  prioritized  other debts.  He  does not
intend  to  pay  these  debts.  Instead, he  plans to  let  them  age  off  his credit report.  (Tr. 40-
44, 73-83, 98; Applicant’s response  to SOR; GE 1-5; AE  A-C)
The $8,564 credit card debt  alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c has been resolved. Applicant
testified and presented documentation to corroborate that he satisfied this debt with the
creditor for less than the full balance in September 2021. Applicant’s 2022 credit report
also  confirms  that  this  debt  was  settled.  (Tr.  78,  97-98;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR;
GE 1, 3, 4, 5; AE A, C, E)
The  delinquent  Federal  taxes  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.i  and  1.j  have  been  partially
resolved.  Applicant  testified  and  presented  documentation  to  corroborate  that  he  has
made  and  complied  with  a  payment  arrangement  with  the  IRS  to  satisfy  those  debts.
Applicant was first delinquent on his Federal taxes for the 2015 tax year. He fell behind
on  his  taxes  because  he  did  not  withhold  enough  money  or  make  sufficient  offset
payments throughout the 2015, 2016, and 2017 tax years. When it came time to make
his Federal tax payments for those years, he did not have sufficient funds to pay them
because  of  his  lack  of  income  with  Company  A.  Applicant  first  made  a  payment
arrangement with the IRS in 2016 for  Federal taxes owed from the 2015 tax year that
were not alleged in the SOR. From 2016 until November 2019, Applicant made sporadic
but  inconsistent  payments  on  his  delinquent  2015,  2016,  and  2017  Federal  taxes.
Eventually, in March 2020, he made a payment arrangement with the IRS that he has
consistently paid for over two years, through June 2022. He intends to continue to pay
these Federal taxes through his current monthly installment plan. As of June 2022, he
had paid down his delinquent Federal tax balance to about $32,900. He does not owe
delinquent  Federal  taxes  after  the  2017  tax  year.  (Tr.  13-14,  38,  42,  52-71,  95-97;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2; AE C, D)
A friend and former business colleague of Applicant whom he has known for over
25 years testified on Applicant’s behalf. Applicant’s witness holds a  PhD in physics and
has held a government security clearance. The witness attested to Applicant’s honesty,
diligence, and kindness. The witness believes that Applicant should be permitted to hold
a security clearance. The witness also corroborated Applicant’s employment experience
with Company A. (Tr. 24-34)
