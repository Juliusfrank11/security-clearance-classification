Applicant  is a  41-year old  married  man  with  two  children.  He  has been  married
since 2018. (GE 1 at 23) He was married previously from 2003 to  2011. The previous
marriage ended in divorce. One of his children is from his previous marriage and the other
is from a previous relationship.
Applicant is a high school graduate and has taken some college courses. (Tr. 14)
He served in the U.S. Navy from 1999 to 2004. He received a general discharge under
honorable  conditions.  (Tr.  14)  He  has  been  working  for  a  defense  contractor  as  a
management analyst since 2019. (Tr. 14)
Applicant has a history of financial problems, including $1,641 of delinquent state
income  taxes  incurred  between  tax years 2008  and  2015,  as  alleged  in  subparagraph
1.a.  During  this  period,  he  was  working  as  a  contractor  for  a  company  that  was  not
deducting his projected income tax debt from his pay. (Tr. 16) He contends that he has
reached  out  to  the  state  taxing  authority,  and  has  settled  and  paid  the  debt.  (Tr.  16)
Applicant provided no documentary proof of this assertion.
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  did  not  file  his  2012  income  tax  return  on  time
(subparagraph 1.b), and that he has unpaid taxes totaling $3,888 from tax years 2012
and 2015, as alleged in subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d. As for the 2012 tax return, allegedly
filed late, Applicant admitted this allegation, explaining that although he completed it and
mailed it on time, the IRS returned it because he forgot to sign one of the pages. (Answer
at 1) He then filed it again, remembering to sign all of the pages.
As for the alleged  delinquencies for tax years 2012  and 2015,  Applicant  admits
incurring these delinquencies. He promised to arrange a payment plan after contacting
the  IRS  to  ascertain  the  exact  amount  of  the  delinquency.  (Answer  at  1)  The  IRS
responded  to  Applicant  on  May  12,  2022.  According  to  the  IRS,  Applicant’s  oldest
outstanding unpaid tax bill is from tax year 2019. (AE D at 1, 3) The other late tax bills are
for tax years 2020 and  2021.  Applicant  entered  into an agreement  with  the  IRS  under
which he is to pay $100 per month to satisfy these delinquencies, beginning in July 2022.
(AE  D  at  1)  The  IRS  correspondence  did  not  include  the  balance  of  the  outstanding
delinquency.
Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in August 2016, as alleged in
subparagraph  1.e.  (Answer  at  1)  This  bankruptcy  was  converted  to  a  Chapter  7
bankruptcy  in  February 2017.  In  May  2017, approximately $58,000  of  debts,  including
Applicant’s income tax debt for tax year 2015, was discharged. (GE 6 at 22, 24, 29-30)
The  debt  alleged  in  subparagraph  1.f,  totaling  $10,811,  constitutes  the  balance
due on a car loan that had been repossessed. (Answer at 1) Applicant purchased this car
in  2018 after the bankruptcy discharge.  (AE E)  After settling a  disability claim  with  the
Navy for $30,000, Applicant used this money to satisfy the car loan. (AE E; Tr. 32)
The  debt  alleged  in  subparagraph  1.g.  totaling  $16,815  is  a  motorcycle  loan
delinquency.  Applicant  has  been  making  payments,  ranging  between  $300  and  $600,
towards  the  satisfaction  of  this  debt  since  April  2018.  (AE  A  at  2;  AE  C)  The  current
balance is $12,109. (AE B)
The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.h, totaling $7,639, is a car loan that Applicant
cosigned with his sister. (Answer at 2) Applicant contacted the creditor, and was told the
account  had  been  settled.  (Tr.  37)  As  of  the  hearing  date,  Applicant  was  awaiting
confirmation  of  settlement  from  the  creditor.  As  of  the  close  of  the  record,  he  had  not
provided any evidence from the creditor corroborating that the debt had been settled.
The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.i, totaling $2,037, is a delinquent phone bill.
Applicant contends that the bill is current. (AE I) Although his current phone bill is from
the same phone company of the delinquent phone bill that was reported delinquent on
Applicant’s June 2020 credit report, the account numbers do not correspond. (compare
AE I with GE 4 at 7) Moreover, per a June 2020 credit report, Applicant disputed this debt
and the dispute was not resolved in his favor. (GE 4 at 7)
Applicant is unsure of the creditor who holds the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.j,
totaling $1,205. He suspects that it is a cell phone account that he opened for his sister
and that she did not pay the subsequent bills. (GE 2 at 3) It remains outstanding.
The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.k, totaling $957, is a phone bill totaling $957.
Applicant confirmed that this account is current. (AE F)
Applicant admits having a credit card delinquency, as alleged in subparagraph 1.l,
but denies the amount of $763. (Answer at 1) He provided no evidence substantiating the
legal basis of his dispute.
The  debt  alleged  in  subparagraph  1.m,  totaling  $385,  is  a  phone  bill.  Applicant
contends that he paid it; however, the evidence is inconclusive.
Applicant attributes his financial problems before filing for bankruptcy protection in
2017 to the breakdown and ultimate dissolution of his first marriage. Specifically, his ex-
wife opened numerous credit accounts, which the family court held Applicant responsible
for, as part of the divorce decree. (GE 2 at 2) He attributes the recurrent financial problems
he experienced after the bankruptcy discharge to the expenses associated with caring for
his elderly, wheelchair-bound father who suffered from a substance abuse problem. (Tr.
42, 45) He stated that he “should have found a way to resolve things a lot better” with his
father’s well-being without putting his finances in jeopardy. (Tr. 42) Applicant also stated
that a series of low-paying jobs and an increase in his child support payments contributed
to his post-bankruptcy financial problems. (GE 2 at 2)
In  June  2020,  Applicant  retained  a  credit  repair  agency  to  help  him  resolve  his
delinquent  finances.  (AE  H  at  3)  Applicant  was  disappointed  with  the  credit  repair
agency’s  services  because  they  continuously  told  him  that  disputed  debts  were  being
resolved, and that they were negotiating  settlements with other creditors, but he never
received any confirmation of their progress. (Tr. 33) He characterized their program as a
scam. (Tr. 21)
Applicant  maintains  a budget.  He  has  $2,816  of  monthly expenses.  (AE  J) The
copy of the budget that he provided does not include his monthly income.
