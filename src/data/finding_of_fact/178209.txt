Applicant  is  a  49-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  where  he  has
worked  since  July  2017.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  military  from  1999  to  2005  and  the
military reserve from 2005 to 2010. All service ended with an honorable discharge. He
seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has held since his time in the military. He
attended  college for several years, but  he  has  not earned  a degree.  He  is  married for
the second time after his first marriage ended in divorce. He has three children between
the ages of 20 and 25 and an adult stepchild. (Tr. at 13-25, 28, 40; 50, 52; GE 1, 6)
Applicant  has a  history of  financial  problems.  He  lost  a job in 2010  because he
was  ineligible  for  a  clearance  upgrade  because  of  his  finances.  The  DOD  issued  an
SOR to him in 2014. That SOR was withdrawn because Applicant was able to bring his
finances back in line. (Tr. at 54-56, 70; GE 1, 6)
Applicant’s finances once again became problematic because he was required to
make  high  child  support  payments  of  $1,000  per  month;  his  daughter  wrecked  their
vehicle in 2016, requiring the purchase of a used car; his wife is disabled and unable to
work; and he pays his disabled sister-in-law $200 per month to help her out. His father
became  ill  and  passed  away  in  2016.  There  were  expenses  related  to  traveling  cross
country  to  visit  him  and  to  attend  the  funeral.  His  youngest  child  has  autism  and  his
second child also has some special needs. He continues to pay his ex-wife even though
his children have reached majority and the child-support order is no longer in effect. (Tr.
at 19, 23-2, 41, 48-49, 52-54; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 6)
The SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling about $27,900. The debts include
a  $629  public  utilities  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.a);  a  $1,970  debt  to  a  landlord  of  an  apartment
(SOR ¶ 1.b); six defaulted student loans totaling about $21,956 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c – 1.h); two
medical debts  totaling $147  (SOR  ¶¶  1.i,  1.j);  and  a $3,199 payday loan  (SOR  ¶  1.k).
Applicant owed all of the debts at one time, but all of the debts have been paid, settled,
brought current, or otherwise resolved. Specific debts are addressed below.
Applicant paid or settled debts that were not alleged in the SOR before the SOR
was issued. He paid or settled debts to American Express and Capital One in 2019. (Tr.
at 73; GE 2-5)
Applicant paid the $629 utilities debt (SOR ¶ 1.a) in July 2021. The debt was for
their final electric bill before they moved. He forgot about it before the DOD bought it to
his attention. (Tr. at 35-37, 56-57; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A)
Applicant’s  previous  apartment  had  a  bedbug  infestation.  The  landlord  hired  an
exterminator and billed Applicant (SOR ¶ 1.b). Applicant believed his neighbors brought
in  the  bedbugs,  and  he  should  not  have  had  to  pay  for  the  exterminator.  He  relented
after  receiving  the  SOR  and  paid  the  debt  in  October  2021.  (Tr.  at  37-39,  57-59;
Applicant’s response to SOR; AE B)
Applicant  was  on  a  $5  per  month  rehabilitation  program  for  his  student  loans
(SOR ¶¶ 1.c – 1.h) from 2019 through March 2020. The student-loan pause brought on
because of the COVID-19 pandemic stopped the rehabilitation program. Applicant has
been  approved  for  a  consolidation  loan.  He  will  resume  payments  when  the  pause  is
over. (Tr. at 39-41, 59-63; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-6; AE C-J, R)
SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j allege $88 and $59 medical debts as listed on a June 2020
Equifax credit report. The creditors are not identified in the credit report or the SOR. The
activity  date for both  debts  is  August  2019. The  debts  are  not  listed  on  the  May  2021
Equifax  credit  report,  nor  any  other  recent  credit  report.  Applicant  has  been  unable  to
find out any information about the debts. (Tr. at 41-43; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE
2-5; AE L-M)
Applicant  took  out  a  payday  loan  of  about  $3,000  to  help  his  ex-wife  with  her
rent. They agreed that each would pay half of the loan. She did not pay her half, and the
loan  went  to  collections  (SOR  ¶  1.k).  Applicant  settled  the  $3,199 balance  due  on the
loan for $1,590, with the payment made in April 2022. (Tr. at 41-44, 66-67; Applicant’s
response to SOR; AE K)
Applicant  received  financial  counseling.  His  finances  are  now  stable.  He
maintains  a  budget.  He  is  able  to  pay  all  of  his  current  bills  without  accruing  any
additional delinquent debts. (Tr. at 44-49, 51-52, 63-70, 73; AE L-Q)
