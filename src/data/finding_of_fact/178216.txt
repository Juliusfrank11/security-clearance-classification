In  his Answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  (¶¶  1.a  –  1.k).  His
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 41 years old. This is his first application for a security clearance. He
has been employed  as  an engineering technician by a  defense  contractor  since 2020.
He  earned  a  high  school  diploma  through  a  correspondence  course  in  2004.  He  was
married in 2003, and has two adult and two minor children. (Item 3)
Applicant’s  SCA  shows  that  he  has  been  consistently  employed  since  2008.  In
his  Answer,  he  claimed  that  the  reason  for his  outstanding  debt  was  because  he  was
laid off and out of work for almost a year. He stated that when he became re-employed,
his pay was not enough to cover his living expenses and resolve his debt. He asserted
that he is trying to resolve outstanding debt, but he did not provide any further details.
(Item 3)
In his 2021 background interview with a government investigator, Applicant was
asked about all of the debts alleged on the SOR. He was unable to provide almost any
information  about  the  accounts,  other  than  affirming  that  the  debts  were  not  resolved.
He  stated  his financial  issues  began  in  2014  when  he  was  laid  off  from  a  high-paying
job. He was also addicted to illegal drugs at that time, which he claimed caused him to
make  poor financial  decisions.  Between  the  drug  use  and  lower  pay  at  his  next  job,  it
caused  him  to  stop  making  payments  on  his  debts.  He  asserted  that  most  of  these
debts  were  incurred  in  2013,  when  he  was  earning  more.  He  stated  that  he  has  not
addressed  his  delinquent  debts,  because  his  focus  has  been  on  staying  sober  and
taking  care  of  his  family.  Applicant  has  had  other  periods  of  illegal  drug  use  and
addiction when he was younger, and served time in prison for related offenses. (Item 3,
4)
The  SOR  alleges  seven  charged-off  debts  totaling  $21,754,  and  four  debts  in
collection, totaling $3,461. The status of the debts follows:
SOR  ¶   1.a   is  an  auto  loan  that  was  charged  off  for  $7,985.  It  is  not  resolved.
(Item 4, 5)
SOR  ¶   1.b   is  a  credit-card  account  that  was  charged  off  for  $4,401.  It  is  not
resolved. (Item 4, 5)
SOR  ¶   1.c  is  a  credit  card  that  was  charged  off  for  $2,339.  It  is  not  resolved.
(Item 4, 5)
SOR ¶  1.d is a credit card that was placed in collection in the amount of $1,958.
It is not resolved. (Item 4, 5)
SOR  ¶   1.e  is  a  debt  that  was  placed  for  collection  in  the  amount  of  $761.
Applicant  stated  that it was  for items  purchased  through  a  catalogue  in  2013  or 2014.
The debt is not resolved. (Item 4, 5)
SOR ¶  1.f is a credit card that was charged off for $759. It is not resolved. (Item
4, 5)
SOR  ¶   1.g  is  a  credit  card  that  that  was  placed  for  collection  in  the  amount  of
$668. It is not resolved. (Item 4, 5)
SOR ¶  1.h  is a credit card that was charged off for $461. It is not resolved. (Item
4, 5)
SOR ¶  1.i is a medical debt that was placed for collection in the amount of $74. It
is not resolved. (Item 4, 5)
SOR ¶  1.j is a credit card that was charged off for $5,138. It was opened in 2012,
and the last payment was made in 2015. This debt is not resolved. (Item 4, 5, 6)
SOR ¶  1.k is a debt that was charged off for $761. In his background interview,
Applicant  claimed  that  this  debt  is  a  duplicate  of  ¶  1.e.  The  credit  report  shows  that
original  creditor  and  the  debt  amounts  are  the  same,  and  it  notes  that  the  debt  was
purchased by another lender. This account is likely a duplicate of 1.e, which is held by a
collection agency. (Item 4, 5)
Applicant did not provide any documentation showing that any of his debts have
been  or  are  being  paid,  disputed,  or  otherwise  resolved.  He  also  submitted  no
documentation  concerning  his  current  financial  situation,  such  as  his  monthly  income
and expenses, his assets, or whether he follows a budget. He provided no evidence that
he has received credit counseling.
