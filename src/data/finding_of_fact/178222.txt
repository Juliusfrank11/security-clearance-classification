In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted all of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) She
also provided mitigating information. (Id.) Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a  58-year-old senior quality  inspector employed  by  a  DOD contractor
for   the   last   34   months.  (Tr.  9-10)  Before   her  current  employment,   she   worked   for  an
automobile  company  as a  senior quality  inspector for 42  months  and  for a  life  insurance
company  selling  insurance  for 21  years  (1993  to  2014).  (Tr.  11, 23;  GE  1) In  1981, she
graduated   from   high   school.   (Tr.  9)  She   received   an   associate’s  degree,  a   bachelor’s
degree  in  2016,  and  a  master’s degree  in  industrial organization  psychology  in 2018. (Tr.
10)  In  1999, she  married  for the  second  time, and  she  has two  sons who  are ages 31  and
39. (Tr. 12)
Financial Considerations
In 2016, Applicant’s husband had a surgery, and he was unable to work. (Tr. 53)
He returned to work for about 18 months, and then he had another surgery. (Tr. 53) He
receives or received Social Security disability of $1,300 per month, and he has part-time
employment where he earns $850 per month. (Tr. 53, 77-78) He is 69 years old, and he
may  be  receiving  Social  Security  retirement  rather  than  Social  Security  disability
payments. (Tr. 90) Applicant was off from work for six months due to knee surgeries in
September 2017 and March 2018, and her pay was reduced 50 percent while she was
not  working.  (Tr.  54-55;  SOR  response)  She  received  treatments  for  cancer  from
September 2020 to March 2021. (SOR response) Applicant’s life was also complicated
because of caring for a sick parent and traveling to visit her parent. (Tr. 42) Her annual
income is about $45,000. (Tr. 77)
The SOR alleges the following financial concerns:
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b allege Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the
Bankruptcy Code in March 2018, and this bankruptcy was dismissed in August 2018. She
and her husband jointly filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code in
September 2018, and this bankruptcy was dismissed in May 2019. Their first bankruptcy
was dismissed possibly because the trustee sent the bills for monthly payments to the
wrong  employer.  (Tr.  55-57)  Applicant  became  briefly  unemployed  in  2019,  and  the
second bankruptcy filing was dismissed because of her unemployment. (Tr. 58) She is
making payments to or paid most of the creditors listed in the bankruptcy documents. (Tr.
58-64) She received financial counseling through the bankruptcy process. (Tr. 87-88)
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d allege Applicant failed to pay her federal income taxes when
due  for  tax  years  (TY)  2007,  2008,  2009,  2015,  and  2016,  and  she  owes  the  federal
government about $91,490 for those five TYs. She files her tax returns separately from
her  husband.  (Tr.  86)  She  was  an  IRS  Form  1099  contractor  when  she  was  selling
insurance starting around 2007. (Tr. 24-34) She had an IRS audit possibly around 2010
or 2011, and there were changes in her company’s payment policies. (Tr. 24-28) Her pay
or bank account had an allotment to pay her federal income taxes for about two years,
and it paid some of her taxes for TYs 2007 and 2008. (Tr. 28-30) She made inconsistent
quarterly tax payments to the IRS because of large variations in her commission-based
income. (Tr. 30, 35) When she had extra money available, she made payments to the
IRS. (Tr. 30) She realizes now that she should have consistently paid her quarterly taxes.
(Tr. 30) Around 2013 or 2014, she started receiving a regular salary, and she was able to
make more consistent payments to the IRS. (Tr. 31-32) She estimated she may owe the
IRS about $2,000 for TY 2021. (Tr. 47-48)
The IRS audited Applicant’s income and concluded her income was much higher
than Applicant believed it was, and the auditor assessed that Applicant owed a substantial
federal tax debt. (Tr. 37-38) On July 10, 2012, the IRS recorded three tax liens as follows.

Applicant said  almost  all  of  her tax  returns  were  timely  filed. (Tr. 36, 40)  She  may
have  filed  her federal  income  tax  returns  for TYs  2016, 2017,  and  2018  in  2021.  (Tr. 41-
42, 91) However, as indicated  in  the  IRS’ filing  in Applicant’s  2018  bankruptcy, the  IRS
assessed  her federal income  taxes for TYs 2016  in October 2017,  and  for TY  2017  in
December 2018.  (GE 5  at  15) All  of her  federal income  tax  returns are filed  except for her
return for TY 2021. (Tr. 39)

SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f allege Applicant owes $2,531 for TY 2018 and $4,244 for TY
2019.  On  July  12,  2021,  the  IRS  sent  a  notice  of  intent  to  levy  property  to  Applicant
seeking payment of these two federal income tax debts. (GE 3 at 10-11)
SOR ¶  1.g  alleges  Applicant  has  a  charged-off  debt  for  $493. She  said she  paid
the  $493  debt,  and  the  account has a  zero balance. (Tr. 66; SOR response)  Her April 27,
2021  credit report indicates paid  account  with  a  zero balance  for this creditor. (GE 7  at 6-
7) She  said in her SOR  response  that there was a  letter attached; however, there was no
such letter attached  to  her SOR response. (Tr. 66-67; SOR response)
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges Applicant’s mortgage is past due in the amount of $1,678 with
a total balance of $68,366. She said the mortgage was her mother’s mortgage, and  her
mother passed away around 2015. (Tr. 69, 72, 90) Two of Applicant’s siblings moved into
the house. (Tr. 73) Applicant and three others inherited the property; however, Applicant
did not believe her name was on the title to the property. (Tr. 72, 76) A tax lien was filed
against the property, and she suggested the IRS may have filed the lien. (Tr. 73, 75) The
tax  lien  could  also  have  been  for  delinquent  property  taxes.  The  Federal  Housing
Administration (FHA) guaranteed the mortgage, and the house was foreclosed. (Tr. 74,
89; GE 8 at 5) Her April 27, 2021 credit report indicated for this mortgage account “claim
filed with government.” (GE 7 at 2) The state billed Applicant for property taxes; however,
delinquent property taxes were not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 75) She did not believe she
was one of the owners of the property. (Tr. 76)
Applicant estimated  that she  owed  the  IRS  about $90,000. (Tr. 43, 50)  About three
months before  her hearing, she  sent the  IRS  a  proposed  payment plan. (Tr. 43, 45-46,
52)  The  IRS  has not responded  to  her proposal. (Tr. 46) She  has not  made  any  payments
to the IRS since July 2019. (Tr. 45)  She  did not provide a copy of  her proposed payment
plan.
