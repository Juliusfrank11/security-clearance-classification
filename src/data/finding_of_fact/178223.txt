After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 49 years old, was thrice married and thrice divorced, the last divorce
being in March 2016. As of his November 2021 Answer, Applicant had remarried. He has
an adult son. Applicant  has an  associate’s degree  (2006),  a bachelor’s degree  (2018),
and a master’s degree (2019). He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from 1999 until
2011, when he was honorably discharged. Applicant has worked for a defense contractor
since  October  2018.  He  was  granted  a  security  clearance  in  December  2008.  While
working  for  that  defense  contractor,  Applicant  was  also  self-employed  part-time  as  an
insurance producer from February 2011 until February 2013 when his license expired. At
the  time  of  his  October  2019  SCA,  Applicant  had  lived  at  the  same  residence  since
September 2012 (a rental). (Item 3.) When he answered the SOR, Applicant had moved
to a different home (which he owns) but in the same state. (Item 2.)
Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  has  seven  delinquent  debts
totaling $38,176. (Item 1.)  He admitted the SOR allegations with explanations and refers
to three credit reports attached to his answer.  (Item 2.)  More specifically, in admitting
these debts,  Applicant also answered that he settled or resolved the SOR debts by or
before October 13, 2021 (Item 2, ¶¶ 1.d.- g.) or November 8, 2021 (Item 2, ¶¶ 1.a.- 1.c).
The credit reports also show that the seven SOR debts were in collection or charge-off
status (sometimes both), some as far back as April 2018. (Items 2 and 4 through 7. Items
5 and 6 are credit reports submitted by Applicant. In his response to the FORM, Applicant
submitted  documents  showing  a  payment  made  on  September  14,  2020,  to  the
collections creditor of SOR ¶  1.f. He also submitted documents showing he settled the
debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and b. on November 8, 2021. (Item 10.)
Under Guideline E, SOR ¶ 2.a. alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose
the delinquent accounts listed in SOR ¶ 1 on his October 2019 SCA. (Item 1.)  Applicant
denied  that  allegation. (Item 2.)  He  offered a  number of  explanations.  First,  Applicant
called the omissions of the seven delinquent accounts from his SCA an “error.” Second,
he mentioned that he was going through a divorce. Third, Applicant noted that he was
“uncertain” of the legality of some of those debts. Fourth, he stated that he had started a
business and guaranteed some of the start-up expenses of that business. (Item 2.) During
Applicant’s  Personal  Subject  Interviews  (PSIs),  he  was  asked  about  his  delinquent
accounts. Applicant agreed that those were his accounts. He was also asked why each
of those accounts was omitted from his SCA. Applicant responded that those accounts
were omitted due to an “oversight.” (Item 9.)
