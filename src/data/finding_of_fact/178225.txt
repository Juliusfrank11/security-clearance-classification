In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the debts alleged in the SOR
(¶¶ 1.a through 1.l), noting that several of the smaller debts had been paid off. He provided
a  narrative  explanation  but  no  documents.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 38 years old. He was married for about 14 months, from November
2005 to February 2007. The marriage ended in divorce, with no  children. He has lived
with a cohabitant since 2009, and disclosed two children born since then, ages 12 and
10. (Item 2, Item 3)
After graduating from high school in 2002 (Item 3), Applicant served in the U.S. Air
Force from March 2003 to September 2012. He was discharged honorably, with the rank
of staff sergeant (E-5), due to injuries he sustained in an auto accident. (Item 2) Since
June 2012, he has worked for a large defense contractor, employed on an Air Force base
as an aircraft supervisor. (Item 2) He has held a clearance since 2003, when he joined
the Air Force. (Item 3 at 3)
Applicant  submitted  an  SCA  in  October  2019.  He  disclosed  several  delinquent
debts, and explained that after a second auto accident, in August 2018, he was placed
on disability for nine months, and his income was reduced to 75% of what it was. As a
result,  he  fell  behind  on  his  payments  and  financial  obligations.  He  noted  that  he  had
retained a debt collection agency to help him resolve several of his accounts, and was
paying $25 per week, per account, until the account is paid off. (Item 2; Items 8, 9)
The record includes three credit bureau reports (CBRs), dated November 2019,
September 2021, and February 2022, which establish the delinquent accounts alleged in
the  SOR.  (Items  1,  5,  6,  7)  He  discussed  his  debts  in  his  background  interview  and
provided updated information, including documentation about various debts and a July
2021 CBR, in an August 2021 interrogatory response. (Items 3, 4)
The SOR debts total about $39,000. The debts are detailed as follows:
SOR ¶¶  1.a  ($20,120), 1.b  ($5,983),  and  1.c  ($9,240) are accounts that have been
charged off by a bank (the same creditor for each account). These accounts represent
about  $35,000  of  the  $39,000  alleged  SOR  debts.  They  became  past  due  in  2018  or
2019, were placed for collection, and have now been charged off. (Items 6, 7) Applicant
disclosed these three debts on his SCA. (Item 1) He said in his interrogatory response
that the debts remained unpaid and he provided no additional documentation about them.
(Item 4 at 3, 4, 9) He provided no additional information in his SOR response about these
debts, which remain unresolved.
SOR ¶  1.d  ($758) is a past-due auto-loan account. (Item 4 at 11-12) As of February
2022, the account was in repossession status with a balance of $3,725, of which $1,138
is  now  past  due.  (Item  7  at  5)  Applicant  admitted  the  debt  and  provided  no  additional
information in his SOR response. The account is unresolved.
SOR ¶  1.e  ($985) is an account that has been charged off. This is an auto loan,
initially for $27,585. The account was charged off in October 2019. (Item 5 at 9; Item 6 at
3; Item 7 at 6) Applicant admitted the debt, noted in his interrogatory response that the
account  remained  unpaid,  and  provided  no  additional  information.  (Item  4  at  4)  .  The
account is unresolved.
SOR ¶  1.f ($1,537) is an account that has been placed for collection. (Item 6 at 2;
Item  7  at  2)  Applicant  admitted  the  debt,  noted  in  his  interrogatory  response  that  the
account remained unpaid and provided no additional information in his SOR response.
The account is unresolved. (Item 4 at 6)
SOR ¶¶  1.g  ($258), 1.h  ($56),  1.i ($10), 1.j ($60), 1.k ($57), and  1.l ($57) are all
medical debts reported for collection. (Item 5 at 7-8, Item 6 at 3) In his SOR response,
Applicant  reports  that  all  of  these  accounts  have  been  paid.  Though  he  provides  no
documentation, the credit reports support that the accounts have been paid. I consider
these debts resolved.
In  his  interrogatory response,  Applicant  provided  a  personal financial  statement
(PFS) and a paystub, among other documents. He earns about $104,000 annually. In his
PFS, he only listed one debt: his $1,852 mortgage. (Item 4 at 10, 13)
In his response to the SOR, Applicant noted that he has held a clearance both in
the Air Force and with his current employer, without incident. He said that after his August
2018 auto accident he was on disability for six months, reducing his income to 60%  of
what  it  was  (rather than  75%  and for nine months,  as  he  noted earlier).  He  said he  is
getting back on his feet but has had some setbacks. He said he had paid off over half of
the debts in the SOR, and was beginning to address the rest. He said many of his debts
were medical bills related to injuries from the accident, since the VA’s medical insurance
denied out-of-network providers who treated him. (Item 1 at 8)
Applicant  provided  no  documentation  with  his  SOR  response.  He  gave  no
additional  details  of  his  efforts  to  address  his  SOR  debts,  whether  through  the  debt
collection company, or otherwise. While  he  indicated  that “over half” of  his SOR debts
have been paid, this appears to refer to the number of debts of which he says that the
smallest six debts, all medical accounts, have been paid off. That accounts for about $500
in  debt  payments,  out  of  about  $39,000  in  delinquent  accounts  alleged  and  admitted.
Applicant noted that when he pays off one account, he moves on to the next, and believes
he is on a good path to address his accounts in collection. (Item 1 at 8)
Applicant  provided no documentation to  support his assertions that  his financial
stability has improved. The record did not indicate that he participated in credit counseling
through the debt collection agency he mentioned in his SCA or otherwise.
