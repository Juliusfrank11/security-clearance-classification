as findings of fact.

Financial Considerations
Applicant  volunteered  information  about  three  delinquent  credit  card  accounts
during his OPM PSI. (Item 6 at 6) He said he stopped making payments on two credit
cards in 2014 due to illness and unemployment. (Id.) He stopped making payments on
the third credit card on an unspecified date due to lack of income. (Id.)
In 2014, Applicant left his position with a DOD contractor because of health issues.
(Item 2) The Department of Veterans Affairs determined he was 100 percent disabled.
(Id.) While he was unemployed, he was living off of his VA disability payments, and Air
Force retirement pay. (Id.) He fell behind on some debts. (Id.)
Applicant’s  June  26,  2021  credit  report  (Item  5)  and  SOR  (Item  1)  allege  four
delinquent debts as follows:
SOR ¶  1.a
is a  charged-off  furniture  debt for $15,087.  Appellant borrowed  $35,000
for home  furnishings.  He paid $19,000,  and  stopped  making  payments  for  a  time.  (Item
2) Later, Appellant  offered  to  resume  payments,  and  the  creditor rejected  this  proposal
and  counteroffered  with  a  request for a  single “lump  sum” payment. (Id.) In  July  2019,
Appellant contacted the creditor and collection agent and learned the debt was charged
off, and the account could not be reopened. (Id.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c are two charged-off credit card debts owed to the same bank
for $2,468 and $2,448. Appellant said he attempted to make arrangements for reduced
payments. (Item 2) The accounts went to collections. (Id.) The collection agency wanted
a single lump sum payment for each debt. (Id.)
SOR ¶  1.d  is a delinquent home loan for $4,821. Appellant said the account was
current when his home was sold in 2019. (Item 2) The creditor wrote “your mortgage loan
has  been  paid  off  or  otherwise  satisfied  in  full.”  (Id.)  He  provided  a  Deed  of  Trust
document with a stamp of “PAID” on it. (Id.)
Applicant’s February 4, 2022 credit report shows 22 accounts. (Item 4) Only one
account has a balance, and that balance is $8. (Id.) Of the accounts listed 21 of 22 reflect
“pays account as agreed” for status. (Id.) The only negative entry is his mortgage account,
which was a Department of Veterans Affairs guaranteed mortgage loan for $347,000. (Id.
at 5) It was at most three payments overdue. (Id.)
The FORM indicated the mortgage debt in SOR ¶ 1.d was mitigated. (FORM at 3)
However,  his  history of  handling  his  other three  loans  warranted  denial  of  his  security
clearance. (FORM at 4)
