Applicant  is  36  years  old.  He  is  not  married  and  has  no  children.  He  has  a
Master’s degree.  He holds the position of Engineer Technician for a defense contractor.
He  seeks  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his  employment  in  the
defense industry.
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  five  delinquent  student  loan  debts  totaling
approximately  $29,000.
In  his  Answer,  Applicant  denies  each  of  the  allegations  and
provides  explanations.  Credit  reports  of  the  Applicant  dated  April  19,  2019;  February
14, 2022; and May 13, 2022, reflect that each of  these debts were at one time owing.
(Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5.)
Applicant applied for and received student loans to  attend a university to obtain
his Bachelor’s degree and Master’s degree.  He obtained his Bachelor’s degree in 2007,
and his Master’s degree  in 2013.  He tried to work full time while going to school, took
some  courses  on  line,  had  various  jobs,  some  of  which  were  contracting  jobs  that  did
not provide stable employment. There were periods of unemployment, and there were
times he only earned minimum wage.  He could not afford to pay all of his bills, which
included  his  student  loan  payments.  (Tr.  p.  22.)  By  later  2013,  Applicant’s  student
loans were in default.  Applicant set up an income driven payment plan but was unable
to  make  the  payments  toward  the  debt  until  2016/2017,  when  he  was  earning  more
money.
In  March  2019,  Applicant  began  working  for  his  current  employer.  Applicant
completed a security clearance application dated April 4, 2019.  (Government Exhibit 1.)
This  was  his  first  time  applying  for  a  security  clearance.  As  part  of  his  security
clearance  background  investigation,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  an  authorized
investigator  for  the  DoD  on  April  26,  2019.
(Government  Exhibit  2.)  During  the
interview,  Applicant’s  delinquent  student  loans  were  brought  to  his  attention.  At  that
point, Applicant realized the importance of addressing these debts.  Applicant hired an
Asset Recovery agency to assist him in resolving his delinquent student loan debt.
In April 2022, Applicant consolidated all of his student loan accounts he took out
for  his  Bachelor’s  degree  and  Master’s  degree,  and  set  up  a  payment  plan  that  he
intended  to  follow.  Applicant  was  scheduled  to  pay  $600  monthly  to  begin  in
January/February 2022.  When he contacted the creditor about the payment, Applicant
learned that the Attorney General had filed a lawsuit against the student loan entity, and
that Applicant was a party to the class action.  As a result of the settlement agreement,
Applicant’s liability  set forth in allegations 1.a through 1.e,  was forgiven, effective June
30,  2021.  (Tr.  pp.  31-32.)  Applicant  no  longer  owed  the  creditor  the  $29,000  for  the
debts  set  forth  below.  Applicant  also  learned  that  monies  totaling  $5,200,  that  he  had
paid from June 2021 to January 2022 toward resolving the debts would be refunded to
him.  (Tr. p. 55.)
Each of the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR are no longer owing and are no
longer of security concern:
Allegation 1.a., is a delinquent debt for a student loan account that was charged
off  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $7,714.  The  debt  was  forgiven,  effective  June  30,
2021.  (Applicant’s Exhibits A1 through A12.)
Allegation 1.b., is a delinquent debt for a student loan account that was charged
off  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $7,547.  The  debt  was  forgiven,  effective  June  30,
2021.  (Applicant’s Exhibits A1 through A12.)
Allegation 1.c., is a delinquent debt for a student loan account that was charged
off  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $6,212.  The  debt  was  forgiven,  effective  June  30,
2021.  (Applicant’s Exhibits A1 through A12.)
Allegation 1.d., is a delinquent debt for a student loan account that was charged
off  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $5,451.  The  debt  was  forgiven,  effective  June  30,
2021.  (Applicant’s Exhibits A1 through A12.)
Allegation 1.e., is a delinquent debt for a student loan account that was charged
off  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $2,268.  The  debt  was  forgiven,  effective  June  30,
2021.  (Applicant’s Exhibits A 1 through A12.)
Applicant  testified  that he  still owes  approximately $189,000  in  student  loans  to
several  student  loan  entities.  These  loans  remain  owing,  but  are  in  good-standing
because he is making regular monthly payments toward resolving the debts.  (Tr. p. 47.)
He plans to follow the payment plan consistent with the requirements of the creditor until
he resolves the debt.
Applicant  stated  that  he  currently  brings  home  approximately  $4,200  monthly.
After paying his regular monthly expenses, including his student loan payments of $600
monthly,  he  has  about  $1,000  left  in  discretionary  funds.
(Tr.  p.  52.)  He  lives
responsibly  and  does  not  spend  money  he  does  not  have.  He  currently  has  no
delinquent debts.  His priority is to resolve his student loan debt.
Applicant also states that he was granted a Q clearance from the Department of
Energy in June 2021.  He now hopes to be eligible to receive a Top Secret  clearance
from the DoD.  (Tr. p. 62.)
