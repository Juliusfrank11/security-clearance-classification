Applicant  is  a  57-year-old  employee  of  a  DoD  contractor  seeking  a  security
clearance.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  since  October  2018.  He  was
divorced in 2012 and remarried in 2013.  He has one adult child. (Item 2)
On   December  21,  2018,  Applicant  submitted   a   security   clearance   application.
(Gov   1)   A   subsequent   security   clearance   background   investigation   revealed   Applicant
had   the   following   financial  issues:  a   $5,737   account  owed   to   a   jewelry   store  that  was
placed   for  collection   (SOR  ¶   1.a:   Item   2   at   40;   Item   3   at   5;  Item   4   at  1,  2);  Applicant
owes the  Internal Revenue  Service  (IRS)  approximately  $13,230  for delinquent income
taxes from  tax  years 2014,  2017, and  2018;  (SOR ¶  1.b: Item  2  at  38-39;  Item  3  at  10-
11, 17); and  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  federal income  tax  returns for tax  years 2015
and  2016. (SOR  ¶  1.c: Item 3  at 5, 20)
In his response to the SOR, Applicant denied owing the delinquent jewelry store
account. (SOR ¶ 1.a) He indicated the account was paid off on January 1, 2022. He did
not provide documentary proof that the debt was paid off in full.  He denies that he has
not filed his federal income taxes for tax years 2015 and 2016. (SOR ¶ 1.c) He claims
the tax returns were filed in January 2022. Applicant did not provide documentary proof
that  his  federal  income  tax  returns  were  filed.  Applicant  admits  that  he  still  owes  the
debt for delinquent federal income taxes. (SOR ¶ 1.b) Applicant states that he owed the
IRS a lot more. He has made payments towards his delinquent federal income tax debts
with varying consistency between December 2015 to September 2019. (Item 3 at 17-18)
However, Applicant did not provide documents indicating the current balance and status
of his federal tax debt.
Applicant listed his federal tax debts and the delinquent jewelry store account on
his  security  clearance  application.  He  encountered  financial  problems  because  of  low
periods of employment in 2018 and his wife suffered from an illness. He had no health
insurance  and  used  his  money  to  pay  his  wife’s  medical  debts.  During  this  time,  the
jewelry store account became delinquent. Applicant claims he has been making monthly
payments  towards  this debt  since obtaining full-time  employment  in October 2018.  He
did not provide corroborating evidence such as receipts, or a payment history to verify
his payments toward this account, or proof of its resolution in January 2022. (Item 3 at
5-6)
