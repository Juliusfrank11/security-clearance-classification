In his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. He
denied the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.c through 1.j, and stated that the alleged debts were
paid.
Applicant is 33 years old. He married his wife in 2013. They have four children. He
served on active duty in the Army from June 2008 to March 2017. He received a secret
security clearance in 2008. He was a specialist, E-4, when he was honorably discharged.
He immediately enlisted in the National Guard and was placed on yearly orders until he
started  his  current  position  in  November  2017  with  a  defense  contractor.  He  is  a  field
service  representative.  After  beginning  his  job,  he  returned  to  reserve  duty  with  the
National Guard. He is a staff sergeant, E-6. His wife was on active duty in the Army for
ten years, during the same time period as Applicant.  (Tr. 17-21; GE 1 at 32)
When Applicant and his wife were discharged from the Army in March 2017, they
had a combined annual income of about $96,000. After leaving, his wife started nursing
school and stopped working. They then lived on his National Guard income, which was
about $30,000. She is still in school, and he continues to support the family on his current
salary of about $49,000. (Tr. 20-23)
Based on credit bureau reports (CBR) from March 2019, November 2019, January
2021, and April 2022, the SOR alleged ten delinquent debts, which totaled $41,335 and
became delinquent between 2014 and 2019. (GE 2, 3, 4, 7) The status of each debt is
listed below:
1.a. The  $14,572  charged-off  account  is owed  to  NF credit  union  for a  $22,000
personal loan Applicant and his wife took out in 2016 to purchase a used car. They made
payments  up  to  the  time  he  left  active  duty  in  March  2017.  He  still  has  the  car.  He
acknowledged that this is his debt. The debt no longer appears on his CBR, so he has
been  unable  to  locate  the  creditor  to  work  out  a  settlement.  (Tr.  23-26)  The  debt  is
unresolved.
1.b.  The $13,127 charged-off account is owed to NF for a loan he took out in 2012
to purchase a 2007 truck. In late 2014, he sold it to another service member, who wrote
him  a  check  for  the  balance  due  on  his  loan.  That  checked  bounced  and  he  became
responsible for the loan balance. He reported the theft to the police. He has been unable
to  locate  the  service  member  or  the  necessary  documents  from  the  sale  of  the  truck,
which are necessary to bring charges. (Tr. 26-32; GE 2 at 3) This debt is unresolved.
1.c. The $4,632 charged-off account was owed to CO for a car loan. After the car
was voluntarily repossessed, it was immediately sold. Applicant negotiated a settlement
for the balance owed and paid it in 2018. (Tr. 33-34; GE 7 at 6) This debt is resolved.
1.d.   The  $4,080  charged-off  account  was  owed  to  PI  for  a  personal  loan  that
Applicant took out to buy a motorcycle. The debt was paid in March 2021. (Tr. 35-36; AE
A at 5) This debt is resolved.
1.e.  The $3,391 cell phone bill was paid on May 10, 2022. (Tr. 36-37; AE A at 6)
This debt is resolved.
1.f. The $652 credit card debt was paid on May 15, 2022. (Tr. 38-39; AE A 7) This
debt is resolved.
1.g. The $341 debt was owed to a company for automobile insurance. It was paid
in February 2021. (Tr. 39; GE 7 at 2) This debt is resolved.
1.h. The $232 medical bill was paid in February 2021. (Tr. 39; GE 7 at 2) This debt
is resolved.
1.i.
This $163 debt is a duplicate of the credit card debt listed in ¶ 1.f, but references
a lesser balance because Applicant had made payments on the debt. It was resolved in
May 2022, as noted above. (Tr. 40-41)
1.j. The $145 medical debt was paid in February 2021. (Tr. 41-42; GE 7 at 2) This
debt is resolved.
Applicant has two debts that were not alleged in the SOR. A delinquent account
for $1,354, which is owed to OPP for a personal loan he took out in October 2019 to cover
work expenses. It was reported as charged-off in March 2022.  He made payments on it
in January and February 2022 according to his April 2022 CBR. (Tr. 43; AE 7 at 4) In April
2022, a college reported a delinquent debt of $3,984 for a training class he took. (GE 7
at  2)  He  established  a  payment  plan  with  the  college  and  has  made  four  bi-weekly
payments of $250 on the debt. (Tr. 44) Both are being resolved.
Applicant has not participated in credit or budget counseling. (Tr. 50) He said his
wife  helps  with  their  finances  and  he  is  more  confident  about  his  financial  situation
because  of  his  current  position.  (Tr.  46)  In  his  post-hearing  submission,  he  said  he
contacted Military One Source and would be working with them for assistance with his
budget. (AE A at 8)
