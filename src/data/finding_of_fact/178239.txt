Applicant  is  a  50-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  where  she  has
worked  since  2008.  She  seeks  to  retain  a  security  clearance,  which  she  has  held  for
many years.  She has a  bachelor’s degree  that  she earned  in 1996,  and  she  took  real
estate classes in 2003. She is twice married and divorced, with two adult children. She
resides with her fiancé. (Tr. at 12-13, 30, 60-61, 94; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1,

The SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling about $71,963. Applicant denied
that she currently owed the debts as they were beyond her state’s statute of limitations.
The debts are established by credit reports and Applicant’s admissions.
Applicant  and  her  second  husband  divorced  in  2010.  Her  ex-husband  received
the house, but had to pay the mortgage loan, which was in both of their names. He was
supposed  to  refinance  the  loan  to  remove  Applicant’s  name  from  the  loan.  A  credit
report  from  February  2013  indicated  that  the  mortgage  loan  was  still  in  both  of  their
names.  A  November  2019  credit  report  showed  the  mortgage  loan  as  closed,
apparently in May 2019. (Tr. at 64; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 4, 5, 7)
Applicant borrowed from her 401(k) retirement account and bought  a foreclosed
house on her block for $24,500 in 2011. She knew the house needed work, but she did
not  realize  how  much  work  until  she  started  renovating  it.  At  the  time,  Applicant  lived
next door in a rented home with her boyfriend (not her current fiancé). Applicant, her ex-
boyfriend, and a witness described how much work was put into the house by Applicant,
her  ex-boyfriend,  and  their  friends.  Applicant  financed  the  out-of-pocket  expenses  of
about  $75,000  with  credit  cards.  She  was  unable  to  obtain  a  mortgage  loan  because
she was still on the loan on the house where her ex-husband was living. (Tr. at 22-24,
34-39, 62-64; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-5, 7; AE B)
Applicant  and  her  then  boyfriend  moved  into  the  house  about  a  year  after  the
purchase.  They  fostered  two  siblings  for  a  period.  Applicant  and  her  boyfriend  later
separated,  and  he  moved  out  in  about  2018  or  2019.  Applicant  was  able  to  keep  her
credit  cards  current,  but  the  high  balances  caused  some  of  the  cards  to  raise  the
interest rates. (Tr. at 35, 40, 46-47, 63, 85-87, 91-92; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE
1, 3, 4, 7)
In about 2014, Applicant sought the services of a debt settlement company. She
was  told  to  stop  paying  her  credit  cards,  so  that  the  company  could  negotiate
settlements  with  the  creditors.  She  enrolled  her  debts  into  the  company’s  debt  relief
plan.  She  paid  $734  every  two  weeks  into  a  dedicated  account.  The  company  would
negotiate settlements with her creditors and pay the settlement amounts, plus their fees,
out of the dedicated account. (Tr. at 40-43, 64-66, 80; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE
1, 7; AE B, C)
One of the creditors informed Applicant that she would be sued if she did not pay
that account. The debt settlement company was unable to help her. She was afraid of
putting so much toward the debt relief plan when a creditor could still sue her, and she
would not have the funds to pay that creditor. She withdrew from the debt relief plan in
about  October  2015.  She  paid  a  total  of  about  $29,117  into  the  program.  Two  debts
totaling about $20,000 were settled. She received a refund of about $2,619, and the rest
went to the company’s fees. (Tr. at 66-70, 80-85; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3-5,
7; AE B, C)
Applicant settled the debt from the company that threatened to sue her, but did
not pay any other debt after she withdrew from the debt relief plan. She stated that she
put  the  money  in  an  account  to  be  used  if  she  was  sued  by  another  creditor  or  to
eventually pay the debts. (Tr. at 81-85; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 3-5, 7; AE
A-C)
Applicant went to a financial advisor in 2017. She wanted to pay her debts and
contemplated selling her house to do so. The advisor told her that she should keep the
house,  but  work  separately  to  pay  her  debts.  She  followed  the  advice  to  not  sell  the
house, but she did not pay the debts. Applicant worked for her employer on temporary
assignment  in  another  state  for  an  extended  period  in  2018.  She  was  able  to  save
$20,000, but that was not enough to pay the debts. She took another assignment in a
third state for almost a year. She worked long hours, six days a week. By the time she
returned  in  2020,  with  overtime  and  per  diem,  she  saved  about  $75,000,  which  was
enough to pay her debts. (Tr. at 47-49, 70-72; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
July 2019 while she was on temporary assignment for her company. She fully reported
her financial issues and  delinquent  debts.  She  wrote:  “I am  completely  responsible  for
the current debt and I have a plan in progress to pay it off.” She was interviewed for her
background investigation in December 2019. She stated that she believed that all of her
debts would be settled or paid by early 2020. (GE 1, 7)
Applicant retained an attorney in 2020 to locate her creditors and ensure the right
company was paid. After researching the debts, her attorney informed her that most of
the  debts  could  not  be  legally  enforced  because  they  were  beyond  the  statute  of
limitations.  Two  of  the  debts  might  not  have  been  beyond  the  statute  of  limitations
because they were being paid by the debt settlement company. She followed his advice
to not pay any of the debts. None of the debts alleged in the SOR have been paid. (Tr.
at 72-75, 87-91, 98; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE A, C)
Applicant  is  engaged  to  be  married  to  a  gentleman  she  met  on  her  last
assignment.  She  sold  her  house  in  January  2022,  which  was  unencumbered  by  any
mortgage  or  lien,  for  $255,000.  She  is  holding  $80,000  from  the  proceeds  as  a  down
payment  on  a  new  home;  she  paid  about  $43,000  toward  her  student  loans;  and  she
bought a new car for about $30,000. Other than the unpaid SOR debts, her finances are
in good shape. (Tr. at 76, 91-93; AE A)
Applicant called witnesses, and she submitted documents and letters attesting to
her  excellent  job  performance  and  strong  moral  character.  She  is  praised  for  her
honesty,  trustworthiness,  professionalism,  dedication,  loyalty,  reliability,  judgment,
sincerity, and integrity. She is recommended for a security clearance. (Tr. at 19-61; AE
