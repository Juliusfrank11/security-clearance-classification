Applicant  is  a  47-year-old  employee  of  a  small  airline.  He  has  worked  for  his
current  employer  since  about  September  2013.  He  has  a  pending  job  offer  from  a
government contractor contingent on him receiving eligibility for a clearance.  He has a
GED,  attended  some  college  courses  from  2009  through  2012,  and  earned  a  trade
license in 2012. He has been married twice. His first marriage was from 1998 until 2011.
He was married again in 2020. He has two adult step-children. He served in the Army
National Guard from May 2007 until June 2008, when he was medically discharged. He
was  awarded  an  honorable  discharge.  (Transcript  (Tr.)  23-34;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 1.)
In  November  2007,  while  he  was  in  the  Army  National  Guard,  Applicant  was
issued an SOR (the 2007 SOR) that alleged various delinquent debts. One of the debts
in the 2007 SOR consisted of an account secured by a repossessed vehicle. Applicant
claimed that his ex-wife  caused his delinquencies  on these debts because  she was  in
charge  of  their  finances  at  the  time.  Applicant  and  his  ex-spouse  filed  for  Chapter  7
bankruptcy in about 2007, and received a discharge of almost $100,000 of debt in about
2008. (Tr. 36-41; GE 5, 6)
The SOR alleges that Applicant had four delinquent debts totaling approximately
$21,000.  These  debts  consist  of  a  telecommunications  debt,  a  medical  debt,  and  two
debts that were secured by repossessed vehicles. The SOR debts appear in Applicant’s
2019 credit report, but not in his 2020 and 2022 credit reports.  Applicant attributed the
financial delinquencies contained in the SOR to a lack of income caused, in part, by an
employment opportunity that did not pan out. More specifically, in about June 2013, he
quit his job performing aircraft maintenance in State A and moved across the country to
State B for a similar job  that he thought  he had been offered and accepted. However,
after moving to State B and informing his new employer that he was ready to start work,
his new employer informed him they had hired someone else and the opening was no
longer available. Applicant decided to stay in State B, found a lower paying job not in his
field,  and  looked  for  another  job  in  aircraft  maintenance.  He  found  an  aircraft
maintenance  position  in  State  B  with  his  current  employer  in  about  September  2013.
(Tr. 27-29, 42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-4, 6; AE I)
The  $173  telecommunications  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  has  been  resolved.
Applicant testified that he settled this debt and presented a document dated November
13, 2020, from the creditor’s collection agency evidencing that the debt had been settled
for less than the full amount. (Tr. 51, 61-63; Applicant’s response  to  SOR;  GE 1, 2, 6;
AE D)
The  $1,633  medical  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  has  been  resolved.  After
investigating this debt when he saw it on his credit report in 2019, Applicant claimed that
a hospital billed him for medical services that were provided to someone else with the
same name. He claimed that the charges were related to treatment for a broken hand,
which he has never suffered. He claimed that he disputed the charge with the hospital
and  the  collection  agency.  After  not  receiving  any  resolution,  he  disputed  the  charge
with  Veterans  Affairs  (VA),  and  the  charges  were  promptly  removed  from  his  credit
report.  Because  of  the  timing  and  the  lack  of  further  contact from  the  creditor and  the
collection  agency,  he assumed  that the VA resolved  the  issue  in his favor.  (Tr. 63-64;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 6)
The $7,379 vehicle loan alleged  in SOR ¶ 1.c has not been resolved. Applicant
told the background investigator in November 2019 that he would pay this debt once he
accepted  his  contingent  job  offer  with  a  government  contractor.  At  his  hearing,  he
testified he would pay it once he had enough extra funds to afford it. For an unspecified
period of time, he did not pay the loan back because of his “arrogance.” Additionally, he
did  not  pay  the  debt  because  he  thought  the  vehicle  was  not  properly  repaired  after
being  involved  in  an  accident,  because  he  did  not  agree  with  the  amount  the  vehicle
sold  for  at  auction,  and  because  the  debt  no  longer  appeared  on his  credit  report.  He
thought  that  if  a  debt  no  longer  appeared  on  his  credit  report,  he  was  no  longer
responsible  for  it,  regardless  of  why  the  debt  no  longer  appeared.  Based  upon  the
conflicting  evidence,  it  is  unclear  whether  he  intends  to  pay  it.  He  presented  no
documentary  evidence  that  he  has  made  a  payment,  disputed  this  debt,  offered  or
negotiated a payment agreement, or taken any significant actions to  resolve  this debt.
(Tr. 50-60; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 6; AE I)
The  $11,836  vehicle  loan  alleged  in  ¶  1.d  has  not  been  resolved.  This  debt
became  delinquent  when  Applicant  abandoned  his  vehicle  in  State  A  after  moving  to
State B in 2013.  He told the background  investigator in November 2019 that he would
pay this debt once he accepted his contingent job offer with a government contractor. At
his hearing, he testified that he would pay the debt once he had enough extra funds to
afford it. He claimed that he tried to catch up on the debt after September 2013 when he
found  another aircraft maintenance position, but  the creditor  wanted  payments that  he
could not afford. The vehicle  that secured the loan was eventually  sold at auction.  For
an unspecified period of time, he thought he did not have to pay the loan back because
of his “arrogance.” Additionally, he did not pay the debt because he didn’t agree with the
amount the vehicle sold for at auction, and because the debt no longer appeared on his
credit  report.  Based  upon  the  conflicting  evidence,  it  is  unclear  whether  he  intends  to
pay it. He presented no documentary evidence that he has made a payment, disputed
this debt, offered or negotiated a payment agreement, or taken any significant actions to
resolve this debt. (Tr. 27-29, 42-50; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 6; AE I)
As  early  as  November  2019,  Applicant  earned  about  $72,000  annually  with  his
current employer. In about November 2021, Applicant’s wages at his job increased from
almost $30 per hour to almost $42 per hour as a result of joining a union. He works at
least  40  hours  per  week  and  is  paid  time  and  a  half  for  overtime.  After  this  raise,  he
makes  about  $85,000  per  year.  Beginning  in  about  2011,  he  began  receiving  about
$600  per  month  in  disability  compensation  from  the  military.  Applicant’s  spouse  does
not  work.  In  about  2019,  she  was  struck  by  a  vehicle  and  is  applying  for  disability.
Applicant  testified  that  he  has  $500  per  month  left  over  after  accounting  for  all  of  his
expenses.  He  holds  stock  valued  at  about  $35,000  and  has  between  $80,000  and
$100,00 in a retirement account. In April 2020, Applicant made a lump sum payment of
about $6,400 to pay off a car loan not on the SOR that he opened in April 2019. This car
loan  was  not  delinquent  when  he  paid  it  off.  In  October  2021,  Applicant  purchased  a
recreational  vehicle  (RV).  He  purchased  the  RV  for  $42,000,  putting  $20,000  down  in
cash. He obtained the cash to pay towards his purchase of the RV by selling some of
his stock. As of the hearing date, Applicant had not filed his 2021 federal tax return. He
knew  he  was  late  in  filing  this  tax  return  and  had  not  received  an  extension  from  the
IRS. He planned to hire someone to file his 2021 tax return for him. He claimed that he
is normally on time with filing his tax returns, but this year, because of a move, he has
not  had  time  to  do  so.  He  claimed  that  he  does  not  normally  owe  money  to  the  IRS
when he does file his tax returns.1 (Tr. 30-33, 53-54, 64-67, 74-77; GE 3; AE G, I)
Applicant  provided  documents  evidencing  his  favorable  resolution  of  several
other  debts  not  included  on  the  2007  SOR  or  the  SOR.  He  also  provided  a  character
reference  from  his  former  landlord  attesting  to  his  compliance  with  the  terms  of  his
rental  agreement,  and  her  satisfaction  with  how  he  treated  the  property.  He  also
provided  a  document  showing  that  he  completed  a  U.S.  Army  training  requirement  in
2007. (Applicant’s response to SOR; AE A, B, E, F)
