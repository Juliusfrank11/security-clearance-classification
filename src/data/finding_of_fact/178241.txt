Applicant  is  a  40-year-old  heavy  equipment  mechanic  foreman  for  a  defense
contractor, employed since 2012. Applicant attended high school, but did not graduate.
He married in 2005 and divorced in 2006. He remarried in 2007 and has two children and
a stepchild. One child,13 years old, lives with him, while the other two are adults.
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  F  that  Applicant  has  14  delinquent  debts,
including  five  medical  debts,  totaling  about  $43,798.  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the
allegations with explanations, and submitted documentary evidence with his Answer to
the SOR.
Applicant explained in testimony that he fell behind on debts when his spouse fell
ill in late 2017 and was unable to work. Due to her condition, she lost her job in late 2017
or early 2018. She started working again part-time in mid-2019, and full-time in early 2020.
During that time, Applicant was unable to cover the family’s expenses. He met with his
facility security officer (FSO) in 2018 and offered to resign because he knew his debts
would  affect  his  security  eligibility.  His  FSO  instead  advised  him  on  ways  to  mitigate
financial concerns. He consulted an attorney with the intent to file bankruptcy, but he was
advised  to  contact  his creditors first  in  an  effort  to  negotiate  settlements.  His  creditors
generally cooperated in facilitating settlement of the accounts.

however,  the  company  refused  to  provide  the  settlement  terms  in  writing  or  submit  a
change to his credit report. His attorney spoke with the creditor and relayed Applicant’s
desire  to  settle  and  pay  the  account.  The  creditor  agreed  to  refer  the  matter  to  their
collection agent to work with Applicant. (AE L)

Some  of  Applicant’s  debts  predated  2012  because  his  work  hours  and  income
fluctuated while working in union positions. His pay has increased since 2012 from $40
to $56 per hour. He was also involved in his father’s trucking business that was dissolved
in 2014 or 2015. Applicant’s spouse handled financial matters for the family and Applicant
became  aware  of  the  extent  of  his  financial  problems  when  he  received  a  call  from  a
collection  agent  in  2018.  He  confronted  his spouse  and  learned  that  she  was  juggling
finances to try to make ends meet, and was afraid he would divorce her if he found out.
Applicant  has  rented  his  home  since  2013  and  currently  has  about  $1,500  in
checking/savings accounts. He is using three credit monitoring services and purchased
short and long-term disability insurance to cover  them  in case of future job losses.  He
borrowed money from his parents to help him satisfy some of the debts and owes them
$3,000. He received financial counseling in January 2022 as part of his pre-bankruptcy
filing.  He  submitted  a  personal  financial  statement  showing  he  has  about  $400  in  net
monthly remainder. (AE B)
Applicant provided three supporting character letters. (AE S-U) One was from a
retired military veteran and military contractor with a top secret clearance, who advised
Applicant  on  how  to  settle  debts.  He  said  Applicant  took  his  advice  and  he  described
Applicant  as  honest  and  hard  working.  Applicant’s  coworker  described  him  as
hardworking and trustworthy, and a former neighbor described him as moral person with
integrity.
