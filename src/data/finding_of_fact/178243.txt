Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except SOR ¶¶ 1.r to 1.aa, 1.ee to
1.gg, and 1.jj, which she denied. She is 55 years old. She married in 1987, divorced in
2002, remarried in 2003, and divorced in 2010. As of the date of  the hearing, she lived
with her fiancé since 2016. She has three adult children. She graduated from high school
in 1984 and attended some college but did not earn a degree. (Answer; Tr. at 6-7, 11, 23,
27-28; GE 1)
Applicant worked  as  a  U.S. Government civilian  from  approximately  1991  to  1992,
1998  to 1999,  and  in  2014.   She  held  inconsistent  employment  with  minimal  income  and
had periods of unemployment between 2009  to  2016, to include six months in 2009, one
month  in 2010, and  from  2014  to  2016.  Since  2016, she  has primarily  worked  as an  over-
the-road   (OTR)   truck  driver.  In   2019,  she   became   a   working   partner  in  her  fiancé’s
trucking  business. As of  the  date  of the  hearing  and  since  approximately  January  2020,
her  fiancé’s company  contracted  with  a  DOD  transportation  company, for whom  Applicant
previously  worked  from  February  to  June  2019.  Applicant testified  that  her  fiancé  had  a
security  clearance, and  she  has never held  one.  (Answer; Tr. at  7-8, 21-26,  28-34, 39-40,
48-51, 62; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  2  delinquent  consumer  accounts  totaling
approximately $10,718 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.kk) and 35 delinquent medical accounts totaling
approximately  $79,444  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b  - 1.jj).  The  SOR  allegations  are  established  by
Applicant’s  admissions  in  her  Answer,  2020  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  and
2020 background interview, and by credit bureau reports from 2020 and 2021. All of the
SOR debts are delinquently reported on the 2020 credit bureau report, and SOR debts
¶¶  1.b,  1.d  to  1.g,  and  1.i  to  1.m  are  delinquently  reported  on  the  2021  credit  bureau
report. The 2021 credit bureau report reflects that Applicant paid SOR debts ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c,
1.h, 1.n to 1.q, 1.bb, 1.dd, and 1.ii. (Answer; GE 1-4)
Applicant attributes her delinquent debts to a relocation in 2009 for a job as a pastry
chef in a restaurant that ultimately failed to open. From 2009 to 2014, she worked multiple
low-paying jobs, had periods of unemployment, as previously discussed, and endured a
failed relationship. She also suffered from physical and stress-related problems, for which
she was prescribed multiple medications by various doctors and was hospitalized three
times between 2014 and 2016. During this period, she did not have health insurance, and
she was denied state housing assistance, Medicaid, food stamps, and disability benefits.
Her  mother  passed  away  in  2016  from  a  terminal  illness  that  depleted  her  mother’s
savings. Regarding this time in her life, Applicant stated that she “. . . made bad choices
in the people I could trust as well as life choices. I kept going downhill not knowing what
else to do,” and “I hit rock bottom.” (Answer; Tr. at 21-26, 28-34, 39, 51-54, 61-62)
Applicant  began  to   regain  control   of  her   life   after she   and   one  of  her daughters
were taken  in  by  that daughter’s boyfriend. She  realized, during  this time, that  a  number
of   her  problems  stemmed   from   her   multiple   prescription   medications,   “but   my   real
problems couldn’t be  medicated  away.” She  testified  that as of the  date  of the  hearing,
she was no longer medicated  or seeing  multiple doctors. In 2015,  at age 49, she made  a
career change  and  learned  to  be  an  OTR  truck driver. In  the  first several years, however,
she  continued  to  experience  financial difficulties,  because  she  was “learning  the  ropes,
[and]  gaining  experience  at  low  paying, low  miles.” During  this time, she also  struggled  to
maintain health  insurance  for herself and  her  daughter,  who  suffered  from  costly  health
issues. As  of the  date  of  the  hearing, she  did  not have  health  insurance.  (Tr. at 21-26,  33-
34, 41-42, 49, 51-54, 61-62)
In  approximately  2016,  Applicant  met  her  fiancé,  and  he  earned  approximately
$20,000  annually  as  a  self-employed  OTR  truck  driver.  Although  they  shifted  their
priorities to keep current on their essential financial obligations, which included a home,
they suffered another setback in 2017, when her fiancé purchased a truck for his company
and the truck immediately began having issues. As of the date of the hearing, they paid
approximately $17,500 for needed truck repairs only to find out that the truck was beyond
repair. They purchased a newer truck one week before the hearing, through a $95,000
loan taken out by her fiancé for which monthly payments of $2,400  were scheduled to
begin  in  October  2021.  She  estimated  that  she  earned  a  minimal  annual  income  of
approximately $20,000 as an OTR truck driver in 2018, and she did not earn any income
in 2019 as a result of unsuccessfully attempting to lease a truck as an owner-operator. In
addition,  she  contracted  COVID-19  at  the  onset  of  the  pandemic  and  business  also
suffered  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  She  estimated  that  she  earned  a  minimal
annual income of $5,600 in 2020 and 2021. They also had a house fire, which destroyed
her  medical  records,  and  she  has  since  had  difficulty  retracing  her  creditors  to  try  to
replace those records in order to address her delinquent medical debts. She testified that
when she received  the SOR in November 2020, “I had to face how deep  in debt I was
and began to pay off some of my debt, as things started to improve at the end of the year.”
(Tr. at 21-26, 38, 40-44, 46-47, 59-63)
SOR  ¶  1.a  is  for  a  $2,310  charged-off  account  for  Applicant’s  car  that  was
repossessed in 2015. After she received the SOR, Applicant paid this debt in December
2020 with financial assistance from her fiancé. The 2021 credit bureau report reflects that
this debt is paid. (Tr. at 42-43, 57-58; GE 3)
SOR  ¶¶  1.b  to  1.jj  are  for  35  of  Applicant’s  delinquent  medical  debts,  totaling
approximately $79,444.  As  previously discussed,  Applicant  does  not  know  what  these
medical debts are for, as she has not been able to replace her medical records destroyed
in her house fire. She acknowledged, as previously discussed, that she had medical debts
from 2015 to 2016 related to her hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and medical
care for herself and her daughter. She testified that she paid SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.h, 1.bb, 1.cc,
1.dd,  1.hh,  and 1.ii in December 2020, after she  received  the  SOR,  and  that  she paid
SOR ¶¶ 1.n, 1.o, 1.p and 1.q in January 2021. The 2021 credit bureau report reflects that
SOR debts ¶¶ 1.c, 1.h, 1.n to 1.q, 1.bb, 1.dd, and 1.ii are paid. She intends to resolve her
remaining medical debts. (Tr. at 22-23, 31-35, 43-47, 49, 52-54, 57; AE A)
SOR  ¶  1.kk  is  for  an  $8,588  debt  placed  for  collection.  This  is  for  commercial
driver’s  license  training  that  Applicant’s  previous  employer  provided  her  in  2016.
Applicant  has  to  repay  her  previous  employer  for  this  training  because  Applicant  left
employment  before  the  required  conclusion  of  her  one-year  commitment.  Applicant
testified that she and her fiancé were saving to pay this debt. They had saved $1,000 as
of the date of the hearing, and they intended to apply this savings toward resolving this
debt. (Tr. at 35-39)
Applicant  earned  her  HAZMAT  certification  and  Transportation  Worker
Identification  Credential  (TWIC)  card.  The  former  is  required  for  drivers  who  will  be
hauling  loads  containing  Department  of  Transportation-classified  hazardous  materials,
while  the  TWIC  card  allows  drivers  to  enter  and  travel  port  facilities  unescorted.  She
testified that she has learned how to make sound financial decisions and understood the
importance of good credit. She testified that she expected to owe $2,000 in taxes for tax
year  2020,  and  she  and  her  fiancé  planned  to  pay  it  using  money  he  set  aside  in  his
savings. She acknowledged that she was not in a position to resolve her delinquent debts.
Her future brother-in-law, a financial advisor, provided her with financial counseling. She
also developed a household budget. (Tr. at 24-26, 35-39, 47-48, 54-63)
