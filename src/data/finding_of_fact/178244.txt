Financial Considerations
From  2012  to  2017,  Applicant  worked  for  the  same  company.  (Tr.  28)  In  2014,
Applicant went on a mission trip to Ghana, and he and his spouse decided to try to adopt
from  an  orphanage.  (Tr. 32) After  two  years  of  background  checks  and  paying  almost

The February 25, 2021 SOR alleges six federal student loans placed for collection
totaling $94,179 as follows: ¶ 1.a for $21,217; ¶ 1.b for $21,063; ¶ 1.c for $19,572; ¶ 1.d
for  $19,453;  ¶  1.f  for  $6,420;  and  ¶  1.g  for  $6,420.  (HE  2)  The  SOR  alleges  three
additional delinquent debts as follows: ¶ 1.e is a charged-off credit union debt for $10,817;
¶ 1.h is a charged-off debt for $520; and ¶ 1.i is a utility debt placed for collection for $87.
(Id.)
Applicant’s six   SOR-alleged  federal student-loan  debts resulted  from  his  college
and   post-graduate   education.  In   2011,  Applicant   received   a   bachelor’s  degree   after
attending classes for two  years while he was on active duty in the Marine Corps. (Tr. 52,
68)  In   2012,  he   started   a   master’s  degree   program,  and   in  2013,  he   left  his  master’s
program  after attending  a  university  for four quarters. (Tr. 68-69) Applicant and  his spouse
estimated  his student loans totaled about $40,000 rather than  the  $94,179  alleged in  the
SOR. (Tr. 50,  84, 111-112) Applicant  had  an  education  deferment  for repayment  of his
student loans in 2012  to  2013  because  he  was taking  classes towards a  master’s degree.
(Tr. 35)  Then  he  moved  several times, and  the  account  was transferred. (Tr. 56, 69) He
never made any  student-loan payments. (Tr. 57, 69)
I asked Applicant to provide documentation after the hearing showing the status of
the student loans to enable an assessment of whether some debts were duplications of
other debts, and he provided the requested documentation. (Tr. 112-113; AE L) On March
3,  2017,  the  Department  of  Education  (D.  Ed.)  informed  Applicant  that  he  had  three
delinquent student loans totaling $47,173 ($37,357 principal and $9,816 interest). (AE L)
The  three  student  loans  were:  $19,545;  $21,181;  and  $6,447,  and  they  were  made  in
2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. (Id.) The debts in SOR ¶ 1.a for $21,217; SOR ¶ 1.c
for $19,572; and SOR ¶ 1.g for $6,420 are duplications of other SOR debts, and these
three debts are mitigated.
In 2019 or 2020, Applicant’s federal income tax refund was transferred to pay  a
portion of his student-loan debt. (Tr. 57, 70) Repayment of his student loans was not a
priority to him because of other issues, such as raising a family, adopting a child from
Ghana,  and  establishing  his  and  his  spouse’s  employments  after  leaving  the  Marine
Corps. (Tr. 86) He was also waiting to see if the federal government would forgive his
student-loan debt. (Tr. 58) He wanted to check to see if he could get a disability rating
from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and then maybe he could use the disability
rating to have some of his student loans forgiven. (Tr. 58) Applicant said he was working
on establishing a payment plan for his student loans. (Tr. 33) He and his spouse sent in
their W-2s, 2019 and 2020 federal income tax returns, and other information to the D. Ed.
(Tr. 33, 85; AE L) Applicant intends to initiate the D. Ed.’s rehabilitation program to  get
his  loans  out  of  default  status.  (Tr.  36,  85)  The  student-loan  debts  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  for
$21,063; SOR ¶ 1.d for $19,453; and SOR ¶ 1.f for $6,420  are unresolved. Applicant’s
spouse’s student loans total about $55,000, and they are current. (Tr. 101, 105)
In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the D. Ed. placed federal
student loans in forbearance. (Tr. 36) On December 22, 2021, the D. Ed. extended the
student loan payment pause through May 1, 2022. The pause includes the following relief
measures  for  eligible  loans:  a  suspension  of  loan  payments;  a  0%  interest  rate;  and
loans.  See  Federal  Student  Aid  website,
stopped  collections  on  defaulted
https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19. His student loans are not listed
on his April 12, 2022 credit report. (Tr. 36-37; GE 4)
The  debt in  SOR ¶  1.e  is a  charged-off  credit union  debt  for $10,817.  Applicant
and   his  spouse   used   the   funds  to   rehabilitate   a   residence   they   received   from   his
grandfather to  enable them  to  rent out the  residence. (Tr.  38) The  rent was insufficient to
cover  the   mortgage,  and   the   property   was  foreclosed   in  2014   or  2015.  (Tr.  59)  The
property  was auctioned, and  there is  no  deficiency  balance  on  the  mortgage  because  the
mortgage  was a  VA-guaranteed  loan.  (Tr. 65-66) The  VA  did not seek any  payment  from
Applicant.  (Tr. 66) Applicant said he  made  four payments  to  address the  debt in SOR ¶
1.e; however, the  creditor turned  the  debt over to  collections. (Tr. 38-39) He said he  is
making  $432  monthly  payments  to address the  debt  in SOR ¶  1.e. (Tr. 39, 86; AE  E; AE
F)  He believed  the  current balance  is  about  $5,900.  (Tr.  50)  They  expect the  debt to  be
resolved in March 2023. (Tr. 86)  This debt is being resolved.
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.h is a charged-off debt for $520. Applicant said he paid the
debt. (Tr. 39) He disputed the status of the debt as indicated on his credit report. (Tr. 39)
This debt is resolved.
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.i is an $87 utility debt placed for collection. Applicant said he
paid the debt when he learned about it. (Tr. 40, 87; AE G) This debt is resolved.
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges Applicant failed to disclose on his February 13, 2020 SCA the
information in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.i concerning his delinquent debts. Applicant did not
disclose any debts placed for collection or charged off in the previous seven years on his
February 13, 2020 SCA. (HE 2)
Applicant said he completed an SCA in 2017, and then he changed employment.
(Tr. 41-42) In 2020, he was supposed to complete his SCA because his 2017 SCA was
apparently not processed. (Tr. 43) For his 2020 SCA, he updated the employment history;
however, he hurried through the  remainder of the SCA and did not read the questions
carefully.  (Tr. 43)  He completed   the  SCA  as  quickly   as  he   could.   (Tr.  46)  He  was  just
checking off the  no  blocks without really reading the questions. (Tr. 71-72) He compared
it to  completion  of  a  medical questionnaire  when  one  has an  appointment with  a  physician.
He did not disclose  his  foreclosure or the  other delinquent debts  on  his SOR. (Tr. 60; GE
1)  He  was  “complacent”  about   his  SCA.  (Tr.  72)  He  did  not  intend   to   deceive   the
government.  (Tr. 44) He held  a  security  clearance  for 17  years, and  he  did not believe  his
SCA or background raised any  security issues. (Tr. 44)
SOR  ¶  2.b  alleges  Applicant  failed  to  disclose  the  debts  listed  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a
through 1.i during his May 4, 2020 OPM PSI. (HE 2) He admitted that he told the OPM
investigator he paid his bills on time and was not behind on any payments at the beginning
of the financial interview. (Tr. 45, 54) When the investigator asked him about his student-
loan  debt,  he  admitted  that  he  owed  the  student  loans,  and  he  had  not  made  any
payments since 2012. (GE 2 at 8) His tax refunds for two years were diverted to pay his
student  loans.  (Id.) He suggested  to the  OPM investigator that  he might  receive  some
forgiveness of his student loans if the VA decided he was disabled. (Id.) He also discussed
his charged-off credit union debt for $10,817 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e, and he said he was in
settlement  negotiations  with  the  creditor.  (Id.  at  9)  He  did  not  intend  to  mislead  the
investigator about his finances. (Tr. 45) His failure to be scrupulously accurate was based
on complacency and his belief that his background did not raise any security issues. (Tr.
45-46) He did not intend to conceal security-relevant information.
Applicant  promised  to  be  more  careful  in  his  future  completion  of  security
documents and forms. (Tr. 47) He will ensure his answers  are accurate and complete.
(Tr.  47-48)  He  has  served  the  United  States  faithfully  for  17  years,  and  he  would  not
intentionally falsify the information he provides to security officials. (Tr. 48) He believes
he can continue to provide valuable contributions to the nation’s defense. (Tr. 48)
Character Evidence
Four  character  witnesses,  including  his  spouse  and  three  friends,  made
statements supporting approval of his access to classified information. (Tr. 74-138) The
general  sense  of  their  statements  is  that  Applicant  is  honest,  diligent,  loyal,  patriotic,
helpful, and trustworthy.
During his Marine Corps service, he received the following awards: Certificate of
Appreciation;  Navy  and  Marine  Corps  Achievement  Medal;  Letter  of  Appreciation;
National Defense Service Medal; Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; Marine Corps
Good Conduct Medal; and Expert Rifle Badge (2). (Tr. 26; AE J) He completed several
Marine Corps training courses. (Id.)
