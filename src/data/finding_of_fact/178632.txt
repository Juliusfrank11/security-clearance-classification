Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.g. He denied SOR
allegations  ¶¶  1.c~1.f.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,
and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  78-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with the defense contractor, in a “casual on call . . . status” since 2016. He is
not married. (TR at page 20 lines 1~15, and GX 1 at page 5.)
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a.  and  1.g. Applicant  has  lived  in South  Korea  since  1979, working  for various
U.S. Government organizations and  U.S. defense  contractors. (TR at page  18  line  2  to
page   20   line   7,   and   AppX   G.)   Applicant’s   “live-in  girlfriend” is a   citizen   and   resident  of
South  Korea. They  have  cohabitated  in  her apartment since  about  2018.  She  is  retired
after having  worked  for the U.S. Government.  (TR at page  44 lines 10~20, and AppX A.)
1.b.  Applicant  has  one   friend   who   is  a   citizen   and   resident  of   South   Korea.  He
works for the  United States  Forces Korea  (USFK). Applicant  had  another friend  who  is a
citizen   and   resident   of   South   Korea.  This  past-friend   got  involved   in  receiving
“kickbacks”  from   contractors,  but  Applicant   has  had   no   contact  with   this  past-friend
since  about 2013, for nearly  a  decade. (TR at  page  35  line 13  to page  38  line  9, at page
42 lines 5~14, at page  44 line 21  to  page 45 line 17, and AppX B.)
1.c.  Applicant no  longer owns an  apartment  in South  Korea.  He sold it and  now
lives with  his Korean  girlfriend, as noted  above. (TR at page  45  lines 18~21, and  AppX
C.)
1.d.~1.f.  Applicant has  no  bank accounts in South  Korea. (TR at page  25  line  24
to page 26 line 6, at page 45 lines 22~25, and AppXs D and E.)
I take administrative notice of certain facts re South Korea:
Notice
South  Korea  is  a  constitutional  democracy  governed  by  a  president  and  a
unicameral  legislature.  South  Korean  government  espionage  and  collection  activities
have  resulted  in  U.S.  criminal  prosecutions.  South  Korea  has  also  been  the
unauthorized  recipient  of  technology  controlled  under  U.S.  export  laws.  Finally,
industrial espionage remains a high-profile concern relating to South Korea and South
Korean companies. (GX I.)
