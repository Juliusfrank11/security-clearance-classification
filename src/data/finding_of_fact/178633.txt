Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 43 years old.
He married in 2003, divorced in 2004, remarried in 2013, and divorced and remarried in
2018. He has four step-children, one adult and three minors. (Items 3, 4, 5, 8)
Applicant  attended   college  from January   2009  to   June  2012,   but  did  not   earn   a
degree.  From   March  to   May   2017,  he   attended   a   community   college   and   technical
institute   and   earned   a   Professional  Truck   Driver  Institute   (PTDI)   certificate   and   a
Commercial Driver’s License  (CDL). He  worked  as a  professional  driver from  May  2017
to   the   date   of   his  September  2019   security   clearance   application   (SCA).  He  was
unemployed  from  December 2016  to  May  2017, June  2018  to  April 2019,  and  August  to
September 2019. As of  and  since  his SCA, he  worked  for his employer as  an  over-the-
road   (OTR)   truck  driver.   He  was  issued   a   Transportation   Worker  Identification
Credential (TWIC)  card  and  Hazardous Material Endorsement (H) in April 2017, but he
has  never held a security clearance. (Items  5, 8)
The SOR alleged that Applicant had 19 delinquent federal student loans totaling
$86,242  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  - p,  1.r  - 1.t).  It  also  alleged  that  he  had  three  delinquent
consumer  debts  totaling  $5,151  (SOR  ¶¶  1.q,  1.u,  1.v)  and  two  delinquent  medical
debts totaling $437. In addition to his admissions in his Answer, Applicant disclosed his
delinquent  federal  student  loans  and  SOR  debts  ¶¶  1.q  and  1.u  on  his  SCA.  He  also
discussed  his  delinquent  debts  during  his  October  2019  background  interview.  The
September  2019  and  June  2020  credit  bureau  reports  list  Applicant’s  19  delinquent
federal student loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.a - p, 1.r - 1.t). The 2019 credit bureau report also lists
SOR debts ¶¶ 1.q, 1.v, 1.w, 1.x, and the 2020 credit bureau report also lists SOR debts
¶¶ 1.q and 1.u. (Items 1, 4-8)
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  to  1.p  and  1.r  to  1.t  are  for  19  delinquent  federal  student  loans
totaling  $86,242.  Applicant  incurred  these  student  loans  when  he  attended  college
between 2009 and 2012. He stated in his SCA and during his background interview that
he  initially  paid  his  student  loans  for  a  short  period  and  then  he  deferred  them.  He
stated in his Answer that he was unaware his student loans were no longer in deferment
and had been placed for collection until he checked his credit report.  He believed that
the  U.S.  Department  of  Education  was  going  to  forgive  his  student  loans  due  to  the
actions of the college that he attended, and he would pay any student loans that were
unforgiven.  He  stated  in  his  Answer  that  he  had  not  received  any  “call  or  e-mails
regarding these debts in quite some time now. I’m unsure where to go from here,” and “.
. . it seems no matter who I call they know nothing about them.” He failed to provide any
corroborating documentation that his delinquent federal student loans were resolved or
of his efforts to resolve them. (Items 1, 4-8)
SOR  debt  ¶  1.q  is  for  a  $1,585  charged-off  credit  card.  Applicant  became
delinquent on this credit card during his period of unemployment beginning in 2016. He
stated in his SCA that he attempted to contact the creditor, but his telephone calls went
directly  to  the  creditor’s  voicemail,  and  the  creditor’s  voicemail  was  full  and  not
accepting  messages.  He  indicated  during  his  background  interview  that  this  debt  was
not  reported  on  his  credit  report  with  Credit  Karma  and  he  would  look  into  it.  In  his
Answer, he stated that he would contact this creditor and immediately resolve this debt.
He failed to provide any corroborating documentation of resolution. (Items 1, 4-8)
SOR  debt  ¶  1.u  is  for  a  $906  charged-off  credit  card.  Applicant  became
delinquent on this credit card during his period of unemployment beginning in 2016. He
stated in his SCA and during his background interview that the account reflected a zero
balance.  The  2019  credit  bureau  report,  which  reports  the  $906  charge  off,  reflects  a
zero  balance;  however,  the  2020  credit  bureau  report  reflects  both  a  charge-off  and
outstanding  balance  of  $906.  Applicant  indicated  during  his  background  interview  that
he would look into this debt. In his Answer, he stated that he would contact this creditor
and immediately resolve this debt. He failed to provide any corroborating documentation
of resolution. (Items 1, 4-8)
SOR debt ¶ 1.v is for a $2,660 past-due student loan. Applicant indicated during
his  background  interview  that  this  student  loan  relates  to  the  same  student  loans  in
SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.p and 1.r to 1.t, and he was unsure why it was reported separately. The
2019  credit bureau  report reflects that Applicant opened this account in 2011, and the
account  was  reported  in  2019  with  the  notation  that  “first  payment  [was]  never
received.” Applicant stated in his Answer that he understood this debt would be forgiven
after  the  college  lost  a  class  action  lawsuit.  He  failed  to  provide  any  corroborating
documentation that this delinquent student loan was resolved or of his efforts to resolve
it. (Items 1, 4-8)
SOR debts ¶¶ 1.w and 1.x are for two medical accounts, placed for collection for
$87  and  $350,  respectively.  Applicant  indicated  during  his  background  interview  that
both  medical  bills  stem  from  injuries  he  sustained  in  a  2018  motorcycle  accident,  in
which he was hit by another driver. He received a settlement from the accident and was
awaiting  his  attorney’s  instructions  as  to  when  to  pay  the  associated  medical  bills.  He
was  unaware  that  any  of  the  medical  bills  had  been  placed  in  collection.  He  indicated
that SOR ¶ 1.x was reported on his credit report with Credit Karma, but SOR ¶ 1.w was
not. He indicated that he would contact his attorney and pay any remaining outstanding
medical bills. (Items 1, 4-8)
In  his  Answer,  Applicant  stated  that  both  medical  debts  were  to  be  paid  by  a
former employer, from 2017 to 2018, for an on-the-job injury that was to be covered by
workers’  compensation.  He  stated,  “I  remember  speaking  with  a  woman  about  this
matter  and  the  last  I  heard,  they  were  contacting  [his  former  employer]  about  it.  That
was several years ago. I assumed the matter had been resolved.” He failed to provide
corroborating documentation that these medical accounts were resolved or of his efforts
to resolve them.  (Items 1, 4-8)
Applicant  indicated  during  his  background  interview  that  he  hoped  to  have  his
outstanding  financial  accounts  resolved  by  mid-2020.  He  also  indicated  that  he  made
changes  since  incurring  these  financial  delinquencies,  and  he  no  longer  uses  credit
cards.  He  indicated that  he  lived  within  his means  and  had no  intention  of  having any
future  delinquent  debts.  He  stated  in  his  Answer  that  he  would  never  risk  his  job  to
repay  a  debt.  There  is  no  evidence  in  the  record  that  Applicant  had  any  financial
counseling. (Items 4, 8)
