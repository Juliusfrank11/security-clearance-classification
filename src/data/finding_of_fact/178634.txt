Alcohol Consumption
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges in about March 2007, Applicant was charged with driving under
the influence of alcohol (DUI). Applicant said he had three drinks at a unit hail and farewell
function  over  about  a  three-hour  period.  (Tr. 32,  75-76,  118) The  drinks  were  not  “big
ones”  or  “doubles.”  (Tr.  118-119)  A  police  officer  stopped  him  for  swerving  on  his
motorcycle. (Tr. 32,75) He refused a breathalyzer because he believed he was impaired.
(Tr. 119) He did not receive a blood-alcohol test. (Tr. 119) The police arrested him  for
DUI, and he stayed in jail overnight. (Tr. 32) After six months of probation, the charge was
reduced to and he was convicted of reckless driving. (Tr. 32, 121) He completed a two-

treatment. (Tr. 33) He said he disclosed the arrest to his supervisor and possibly to his
security officer. (Tr. 78-79)
Applicant received a memorandum of reprimand for the 2007 DUI arrest, and he

(Tr. 79, 120) The reprimand was filed in his personnel file. (Tr. 120) He was taken off of
the promotion list for CW5, and he realized he would not be promoted to the rank of CW5.
(Tr. 120) He also completed the standard Army alcohol-counseling program consisting of

consumption  was  from  2006  to  2009,  and  during  this  period  he  occasionally  had  five
drinks during a single sitting. (Tr. 82, 112)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  in  about  August  2009,  Applicant  was  charged  with  DUI.  He
claimed he drank four drinks  over about a  three-hour period  at a party.  (Tr.  80)  At his
hearing, he said that he did not remember the blood-alcohol content (BAC) test result,
and  then  he  said  it  could  have  been  a  .2.  (Tr.  121-122)  The  Office  of  Personnel
Management (OPM) report of investigation (ROI) indicates his BAC was .23 percent. (AE
M at 80) After considering the OPM ROI BAC test result, he conceded that he did not
remember how much he had to drink at the party. (Tr. 163) He believed he was impaired
but not intoxicated. (Tr. 81) The police arrested him for DUI on his way home from the
party. (Tr. 82) He was found guilty of DUI first offense. (Tr. 123; AE M at 81) He received
11 months and 29 days of probation, 2 days in jail, a $350 fine, and loss of driver’s license
for one year. Id. He did not participate in any alcohol counseling or treatment after the
2009  DUI.  (Tr.  83)  Applicant  disclosed  the  DUI  arrest  to  his  supervisor.  (Tr.  84,  123)
However,  no  incident  report  from  his  security  record  was  offered  as  an  exhibit  at  his
hearing. (Tr. 84, 93)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges in about March 2013, Applicant was charged with DUI. Applicant
claimed that he drank two to five beers at a  friend’s residence  over a five-hour period,
and then he elected to drive a friend home before going to his own home. (Tr. 85-86, 123)
The police stopped Applicant because he was blocking an intersection. (Tr. 86) Applicant
was stopped in the intersection because he was unsure about which way to turn. (Tr. 86)
He was arrested for DUI, but not charged with DUI. (Tr. 90)  He refused a breathalyzer
even though he was aware that he should have metabolized one beer per hour and not
been intoxicated by the time the police stopped him. (Tr. 123-124) He was also aware
that the refusal of a breathalyzer would result in suspension or revocation of his driver’s
license, and the refusal would be admissible in a DUI trial. (Tr. 125)
Applicant received a pretrial diversion for the 2013 DUI. (Tr. 90) He completed two
years of unsupervised probation and about 12 hours of alcohol classes. (Tr. 87, 91; GE
6 at 3) He performed community service, and he went to two Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)
meetings. (Tr. 88) He said he was told by the county alcohol counselor that his DUI was
a  one-time  event,  and  because  he  did  not  drink  during  the  week,  he  did  not  have  a
problem with alcohol. (Tr. 88-89) However, Applicant realizes now that he had an alcohol
problem. (Tr. 89) He did not have a document from the counselor indicating he did not
have an alcohol problem; however, he believed such a document was possibly submitted
to the court adjudicating the DUI offense. (Tr. 89-90) He said he disclosed the DUI arrest
to his supervisor and security officer; however, no incident report from his security record
was offered as an exhibit at his hearing. (Tr. 92-93)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges in about  May 2017, Applicant was charged with  Operating a
Vehicle While Under the Influence of Alcohol (OUI). He claimed that he went to dinner
and had three, maybe four drinks over about a three-hour period. (Tr. 39, 95, 125) The
police stopped him possibly for swerving while driving; he refused a breathalyzer; and he
was arrested for OUI. (Tr. 39, 95, 125) The police report indicates he swerved and almost
hit a “passing semi.” (Tr. 96; AE N (police report)) However, Applicant did not remember
much  about  his  driving  before  the  arrest.  (Tr.  95)  He  was  charged  with  OUI  Second
Offense. (AE N (arraignment)) He pleaded guilty to OUI First Offense. (file) He received
a fine of $1,250. In November 2017, he completed a 24-hour class over a weekend and
learned about alcohol consumption. (Tr. 40-47, 96-97; AE B; AE F) He abstained from
alcohol consumption from May to November 2017. (Tr. 41, 53) No incident report from
his security record concerning the 2017 OUI was offered as an exhibit at his hearing. (Tr.
102)
Applicant admitted he had a problem with alcohol consumption, and it is a “lifelong
issue” for him. (Tr. 43, 49, 63) He described himself as a “recovering alcoholic.” (Tr. 63)
He decided to limit his alcohol consumption after November 2017 to two standard drinks
in an evening. (Tr. 49, 51-52, 165-166) He claimed he has only consumed about 20 drinks
in the last year, or perhaps it was 24 or 25 drinks. (Tr. 50, 62) He typically drinks no more
than three beers in a weekend or possibly two or four drinks in a month. (Tr. 50-51, 53,
105; SOR response ¶ 39) He may not drink anything for a month. (Tr. 105) He has not
become  intoxicated  since  2017.  (Tr.  53)  He  most  recently  consumed  alcohol  a  month
before his hearing, and on that occasion, he drank one beer. (Tr. 102-103)
Applicant occasionally reviews the workbook he received from his alcohol-related
class  in  2017  to  reinforce  and  refresh  what  he  learned  about  limiting  his  alcohol
consumption.  (Tr.  60,  66,  97;  AE  F)  He  understands  the  risks  of  excessive  alcohol
consumption  and  believes  he  will not  engage  in  excessive  alcohol consumption  in  the
future. (Tr. 66) In June 2021, he moved overseas, and attendance at alcohol counseling
or classes was difficult. (Tr. 100) He attended two sessions over the Internet about alcohol
consumption in 2021 after he received the SOR. (Tr. 61, 97-98) Those two sessions are
the only counseling or treatment he has received for alcohol since 2017. (Tr. 65) He never
had a one-on-one session where an alcohol or medical counselor reviewed his history of
alcohol  consumption.  (Tr.  128)  He  was  never  advised  that  his  history  warranted  a
recommendation of abstinence from alcohol consumption. (Tr. 128)
Applicant  has  never  been  diagnosed  with  alcohol  dependence  or  alcohol  use
disorder. (Tr. 113) He exercises to reduce stress. (Tr. 54, 62) He has not engaged in any
questionable conduct after 2017. (Tr. 110) His support group is his girlfriend and a close
friend. (Tr. 64) He does not drive after consuming alcohol. (Tr. 100, 105, 134, 165; SOR
response ¶ 39)
