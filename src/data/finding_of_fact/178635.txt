Applicant  is  a  55-year-old  employee  of  a  government  contractor.  While  the
names of  the contractors for whom he has worked have changed because of mergers
or because a new company has been awarded a contract, he has worked in the same
position  since  January  2008.  He  earned  a  high  school  diploma  in  1984  and  an
associate’s  degree  in  2010.  He  has  been  married  since  2006.  He  was  married  once
before  from  1990  until  2001.  Applicant  has  four  children,  two  of  whom  are  minors  for
whom he is financially responsible. He had a step-child who passed away in April 2010
at the age of 11 from a genetic disorder. He and his current spouse lived separate and
apart for about a month from March 2021 until about April 2021. (Transcript (Tr.) 19-26;

The  SOR  alleges  Applicant’s  1998  and  2010  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  filings  and
discharges  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b),  as  well  as  eight  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately $96,000. These delinquencies consist of student loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.c and
1.d),  and  medical  debts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.e  through  1.j).  Approximately  $90,000  of  the
delinquent debt in the SOR is for delinquent student loans. Applicant admitted all of the
SOR  allegations  with  additional  comment.  His  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of
fact. (Tr. 18-20, 25-39, 43-49, 54-55; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-7; AE A)
Applicant  filed  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  case  in  January  1998.  This  bankruptcy
was  discharged  in  April  1998.  Applicant  claimed  that  he  filed  this bankruptcy  because
his ex-wife was incurring debt, but not contributing to their income because she was not
working. He claimed that he decided it would be better for him to discharge their debts
because he thought he would have to pay all of it himself when he and his ex-wife split
up. He had between $50,000 and $100,000 in debt consisting of credit cards and loans
discharged in this bankruptcy. (Tr. 25-26; Applicant's response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant filed another Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in April 2010. This bankruptcy
was discharged in August 2010. Under Schedule D, Creditors Holding Secured Claims,
the petition listed two auto loans totaling $52,157. Under Schedule E, Creditors Holding
Unsecured Priority Claims, the petition listed $24,239 in student loans. Under Schedule
F,  Creditors  Holding  Unsecured  Nonpriority  Claims,  the  petition  listed  claims  totaling
$364,055. The Schedule F claims included $82,155 in student loans. Applicant claimed
that he filed this bankruptcy because he had a lot of medical debt from the cost of care
for  his  stepdaughter  who  was  gravely  ill.  He  also  claimed  that  he  decided  to  file  this
second bankruptcy because he had abandoned his home as he decided the home was
too small for his family to live in. Providing medical care for his stepdaughter and having
space  for  her  medical  equipment  played  a  major  role  in  this  decision.  After  trying  to
negotiate a settlement with his mortgage company, he abandoned the home and rented
another  home.  He  did  not  attempt  to  sell  his  home  because  he  claimed  it  was  in
disrepair. He stopped making mortgage payments on the abandoned home. He claimed
that once his other creditors noticed that  he had defaulted  on  his mortgage  loan,  they
accelerated his debts on their accounts and he could not afford to pay them. (Tr. 26-29,
43-46; Applicant's response to SOR; GE 1, 3)
loans  were  delinquent  until  his  March  2020  clearance
The student loan  debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c  and 1.d have  not been  resolved.
Applicant took out these loans from 2004 through 2008 or 2009. The loans first became
due  sometime  in  2010,  but  Applicant  consistently  applied  for  forbearance  or  deferrals
for several years. Applicant may have made one or two payments on his student loans
after 2010, but he also testified that he was not sure about making these payments and
he  may  not  have  made  any  payments.  The  February  and  August  2020  credit  reports
reflect  a  last  activity  date  of  October  2018.  The  July  2021  credit  report  reflects  a
delinquency date of October 2018 for both debts. Applicant provided no documentation
to  support  his contention  that he made any payments on  these loans.  He  provided  no
documents  to  corroborate  whether  or  when  his  student  loans  were  in  forbearance  or
deferred prior to being referred to collections. He claimed that he did not realize that his
interview,  but
student
acknowledged  that  he  had  not  checked  on  their  status  for  some  time  prior  to  that.
Applicant tried to contact the government to rehabilitate his student loans for a couple of
months beginning in March 2020 but couldn’t get through to anyone. He speculated that
his  inability  to  connect  with  someone  was  because  of  the  pandemic.  After  these
attempts in spring of 2020, he stopped trying to rehabilitate his student loans until about
December  2021.  In  December  2021,  he  entered  into  a  student  loan  rehabilitation
agreement  with  the  government  and  his  loan  servicer  that  calls  for  him  to  contact  the
loan  servicer  to  begin  to  make  payments  on  his  debt.  He  plans  to  contact  his  loan
servicer  in  August  2022.  He  admitted  that  he  contacted  the  government  in  December
2021 to attempt to rehabilitate his student loans because he received the  SOR. I have
taken administrative notice that all federal student loans were eligible for placement in a
deferment  status  as  of  late  March  2020  at  the  earliest.  Therefore,  available  evidence
shows  that  Applicant  was  delinquent  on  these  debts  prior  to  any  placement  in  a
deferment status. (Tr. 29-35, 46-49; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 4-7; AE A)
The delinquent medical debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.e through 1.j have been settled.
The  activity  dates  listed  on  the  credit  reports  for  the  medical  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.e
through 1.h are no later than September 2018. The credit reports for the debts in SOR
¶¶ 1.i and 1.j do not list activity dates. These SOR medical debts arose from a medical
emergency when Applicant  suffered from atrial fibrillation  (a-fib) in 2018. In addition to
his  direct  medical  expenses,  Applicant  also  paid  about  $300  to  $400  per  month  for
medication related to his a-fib from 2018 until late 2019 or early 2020 when he switched
cardiologists and began paying about $75 per month. In April 2021, Applicant borrowed
money  from  his  brother  and  settled  all  the  debts  listed  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.e  through  1.j.  He
provided  corroborating  documentation  that  he  settled  these  accounts.  After  settling
these  accounts,  he  borrowed  money  from  his  retirement  savings  in  order  to  pay  his
brother  back.  He  admitted  that  receiving  the  SOR  was  what  motivated  him  to  take
action  to  settle  these  medical  debts.  (Tr.  35-36,  51-54;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR;
GE 1, 4, 5)
Applicant  earns  $52.26  per  hour  and  works  full-time.  He  occasionally  works
overtime.  He  made  approximately  $80,000  in  2021,  but  that  amount  was  lower  than
expected because he suffered a broken arm and could not work for about three and a
half months. During the time he was injured, he was paid disability and a small  stipend
from his union. His wife contributes to the family income and has earned between $20
and $23  per hour over the past  three  years as  an employee  of State A. However, before
her  child   passed   away   in  about  2011,  his  wife   had   a   hard  time   finding   steady
employment  because   of   the   time-consuming   medical  care  that  her   daughter  required.
Applicant’s  wife   handles  all   the   finances  because   Applicant  claims  that  he   has  limited
access to  electronic devices in his workplace.  He and  his wife  pay  $1,850  per month  for
the  mortgage  on  the  house  they  purchased  in  2014. They  have  a  $600  per month  car
payment  for  a   2018   SUV  they   purchased   in   2018.   They   pay   approximately   $300   per
month   for  electricity   and   pay   the   full   balances  on   their   credit  cards  every   month.
Applicant testified  that he  has between  $15,000  to  $20,000  in his checking  account and
$5,000  to  $10,000  in  his savings account.  When  asked  why  he  did  not  use  this money
towards  his SOR debts, he  claimed  that he  did not  have  it at the  time  because  he  was
living  apart  from  his wife  and  they  were paying  for two  places to  live.  Applicant and  his
wife  do  not follow  a  written  budget  and  he  could not  specify  how   much  money  he  has
left  over  at  the   end   of   each   month   after  paying   his  bills.  He  has   not   received   any
financial  counseling   other than   what   was  required   for his bankruptcies.   (Tr.  21-25,  39-
42;  Applicant’s response to  SOR; GE 1-3)
In addition to the aforementioned causes, Applicant attributed his financial issues
to  the  2013  government  shutdown  and  a  ruptured  biceps  tendon  he  suffered  in  2013
that  kept  him  out  of  work  for  five  to  six  months.  He  had  to  take  a  loan  from  his
retirement account at this time in order to keep up with his financial obligations. He also
suffers from silicosis, or scarring of the lungs, as a result of breathing in fine particles of
silicon at a worksite where he worked from 1999 through 2002. (Tr. 28-29, 56-57)
