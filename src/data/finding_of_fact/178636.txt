Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR allegations  in her  Answer. She  is 50  years old.
She   is   married   and   she   has   seven   children--five   adults  and   two   minors--and   six   step-
children--all adults.  (Items  1, 2)
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  1990.  She  worked  for  ten  years,  from
November 2008 to June 2018, as a cook and teacher’s aide in state A. She then worked
as a part-time auction driver from July to September 2018, in state B. She has worked
as  a  maintenance  person  since  October  2018  in  state  C,  and  she  has  worked  in  that
capacity  for  her  employer,  a  DOD  contractor,  since  May  2020.  She  has  never  held  a
security clearance. (Item 3)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  10  delinquent  consumer  debts  totaling
$26,628 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.b, 1.d - 1.f, 1.h - 1.l) and two delinquent medical debts totaling
$2,387  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  1.g).  In  addition  to  her  admissions  in  her  Answer,  Applicant
disclosed her delinquent debts on her June 2020 security clearance application (SCA).
She also discussed her delinquent debts during her July 2020 background interview. A
July 2020 credit bureau report lists all of Applicant’s delinquent debts. (Items 1-5)
Applicant  attributes  her  delinquent  debts  to  the  high  cost  of  living  and  minimal
income she and her spouse earned  in state A, where she was born and lived with her
family  until  2018.  During  that  time,  her  spouse,  at  times,  was  an  unreliable  source  of
income  because  he  was  “in  and  out  of  [treatment]  programs  and  facilities.”  She  also
indicated  that  she  did  not  receive  financial  help  from  her  older  children’s  fathers.  In
2018,  Applicant  and  her  spouse  moved  their  family  to  state  B  for  a  better  life,  but
Applicant  was  only able  to find  part-time  employment, as  discussed  above.  They then
moved to state C, where she secured full-time employment and earned more than when
she  was  employed  in  state  A.  She  attempted  to  resolve  her  delinquent  debts  while
maintaining  steady  employment  in  state  C,  but  the  credit  union  through  which  she
applied  for  a  debt  consolidation  loan  denied  her  based  on  her  negative  credit  history.
