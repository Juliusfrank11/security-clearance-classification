He lives with a woman with whom he has a child. In July 2020, he began a position as a
warehouse specialist with a defense contractor. He has been employed since 2008, but
has not earned sufficient money to pay his bills,  which lead to financial difficulties and
delinquencies. (Items 3 and 4)

discharged  in  September  2002.  (Item  5)  The  amount  of  debt  discharged  is  not  in  this
record.  In  October  2016,  Applicant  filed  his  second  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  petition.  In

2020, a personal loan was charged off in the amount of $4,051. These debts total about
$19,400. None of them have been resolved or are being addressed.
According  to  a  budget  Applicant  submitted  with  his  2016  Chapter  7  bankruptcy
petition, his net monthly income was $1,172 and expenses were $2,166, resulting in a
$994 monthly shortage. (Item 6 at 40-43) During his October 2020 background interview,
Applicant told the investigator that his financial situation had improved since he became
employed with the defense contractor in 2020.  (Item 4 at 5) Applicant did not submit a
more current budget or documentation that he obtained credit or financial counseling or
