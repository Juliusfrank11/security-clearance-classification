The SOR alleged that Applicant petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December
2020, which was pending as of the date of the SOR (SOR ¶ 1.a). It also alleged that he
had three delinquent consumer debts totaling $70,939 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b - 1.d). In addition to
his  admissions  in  his  Answer,  Applicant  disclosed  SOR  debts  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.d  on  his
SCA,  and  he  discussed  his  delinquent  debts  during  his  September  2020  background
interview.  The  August  2020  credit  bureau  report  lists  SOR  debts  ¶¶  1.b,  1.c,  and  1.d.
The  February  2021  credit  bureau  report  lists  Applicant’s  December  2020  bankruptcy
(SOR  ¶  1.a).  It  also  reflected  that  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.c  were  included  in  Applicant’s
December 2020 bankruptcy, carried a zero balance, and were closed accounts. It also
reflected that Applicant did not have any outstanding delinquent debts. SOR ¶ 1.d was
not reported on the 2021 credit bureau report. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
Applicant  attributed  his  delinquent  debts
from
underemployment  when  he  was  not  employed  overseas.  In  2014,  he  resigned  from
employment with a DOD contractor overseas when family issues affected his ability to
work.  In  2019,  he  also  resigned  from  employment  overseas  with  a  DOD  contractor
when he was unexpectedly not cleared to work after taking medical  leave for a hernia
repair. His court-ordered child support obligation of $2,000 monthly from approximately
2014  until September 2019,  when  it  was  reduced  to  $1,000 monthly,  also  affected his
lack  of
income
to  a
finances.  He  also acknowledged  that he  made  bad  financial decisions.  (Answer; Items
2, 3, 6).
SOR  ¶  1.b  is  for  a  credit-card  account  past  due  in  the  approximate  amount  of
$3,921,  with  a  total  balance  of  $24,343.  Applicant  stated  in  his  SCA  that  he  had
obtained  better  employment  and  was  trying  to  resolve  this  debt.  He  indicated  in  his
background  interview  that  he  was  communicating  with  the  creditor  in  an  attempt  to
make payment arrangements for this debt. This debt was resolved through Applicant’s
December 2020 bankruptcy. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6)
SOR debt ¶ 1.c is for a credit-card account past due in the approximate amount
of  $2,804,  with  a  total  balance  of  $23,182.  Applicant  indicated  in  his  background
interview that  he  was  communicating with  the  creditor in an attempt  to make  payment
arrangements. This debt was resolved through Applicant’s December 2020 bankruptcy.
(Items 3, 4, 5, 6)
SOR  debt  ¶  1.d.  is  for  a  credit-card  account  placed  for  collection  in  the
approximate amount of $23,414. Applicant stated in his SCA that he had not yet made
payments on this debt because he was unsuccessful in his attempts with the creditor to
lower his payment. He indicated in his background interview that he was communicating
with  the  creditor in an attempt  to make payment  arrangements.  Although  not  reflected
as such on his credit reports, this debt is resolved through Applicant’s December 2020
bankruptcy. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6)
Applicant  acknowledged  in  his  background  interview  that  his  financial  status
needed improvement and “he feels like he’s in over his head.” He indicated that he was
not  able  to  make  timely  payments  on  his  debts  and  he  lacked  the  financial  means  to
repay  his  debts,  but  that  he  was  willing  to  resolve  them.  He  was  intent  on  securing
better  employment,  saving  money,  and  reaching  payment  arrangements  with  his
creditors so that he could resolve his debts and avoid future financial problems. He had
not yet had any financial counseling. (Items 2, 3, 6)
