In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted all of the allegations in SOR (¶¶ 1.a,
through 1.h). Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 28-year-old employee of a DOD contractor who has worked for this
employer since February 2019. Her job title is aircraft modification electrician. She served
in the Army National Guard from December 2010 until January 2019, when she received
an honorable discharge. She earned an associate’s degree in 2019. She has held a DOD
security clearance since 2011. She was married in 2013, and has an 8-year-old son with
special needs. (Tr. 10-11, 21; GE 1)
Financial Considerations
The  SOR  alleges  eight  delinquent  debts  totaling  approximately  $51,700.  The
majority of the debt is from two repossessed vehicles in the amount of $48,372, with the
most recent vehicle purchased in 2020 and repossessed shortly thereafter. (¶¶ 1.f and
1.h) Applicant stated that she suffered financial issues after she received a significant cut
in pay after she was required to move for her job in February 2021. In addition, she was
unemployed  for  a  period  of  time  taking  care  of  her  disabled  son  and  step-father.  Her
current  annual  salary  is  $88,100,  and  her  husband’s  salary  is  approximately  $54,000.
Beginning in June 2022, her husband will be earning approximately $95,000 annually with
his new employer. (Tr. 59; GE 2, GE 6)
In September 2020, Applicant participated in a background interview with a DOD
investigator. Her delinquent debts were discussed and she stated that she was catching
up on the overdue bills, and that some of the outstanding accounts from her credit report
were being disputed. (GE 6)
Applicant lived with her parents from June 2013 to April 2019. She  testified that
she and her spouse suffered financial problems beginning in 2017, when she attended
college full-time until 2019. During this two-year period, she took care of their disabled
son during the day, worked part-time, and her husband’s hours were reduced from his
employer. These circumstances caused them financial issues and they were unable to
pay all of their bills. (Tr. 21-25, 28-29, 54-55; GE 1)
Applicant was hired by her current employer in February 2019. At the request of
her  employer,  she  moved  from  State  A  to  live  a  month  or  two  in  State  B  to  establish
residency,  and  then  she  returned  to  State  A  for  her  employment  duties.  Her  move
increased her salary by 15% and she received a monthly housing stipend of about $3,000.
She believed that she would stay in State A for the next decade, but the pandemic hit the
country, and in about December 2020, her employer notified her that she would return to
State B in about February 2021. Upon her return to State B, Applicant lost the 15% pay
increase  and  the  $3,000  monthly  housing  stipend,  which  negatively  impacted  her
finances. (Tr. 13, 21-25, 28-29, 54-55; GE 1)
The SOR includes the following financial allegations:
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  is  indebted  for  an  unpaid  medical  account  in  the
amount of $662. Applicant stated that the insurance paid this medical bill and  she was
disputing  the  account.  Department  Counsel  asked  her  if  she  could  provide  supporting
documentation  while  I  held  the  record  open  for  two  weeks,  and  Applicant  agreed.  No
documentation was submitted and this debt remains unresolved. (Tr. 32, 58; GE 6)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a charged-off Bank of America account in the amount of $783.
Applicant testified that this was a credit card that became delinquent in 2017. The creditor
recently  offered  a  settlement  of  $200  to  resolve  the  outstanding  balance,  and  she  is
currently working on paying that settlement. Department Counsel asked her to provide
supporting documentation if she settled the account while the record was held open, and
Applicant  agreed.  No  documentation  was  submitted  and  this  debt  remains  unresolved
(Tr. 34-37, 61)
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d allege two unpaid accounts with Credit One Bank, one account
is $100  past due  with  a  balance  of  $630,  and  the  second  account is delinquent  in the
amount of $545. Applicant stated that she is in the process of paying the first account,
and the second account remains unpaid. She agreed to submit documentation while the
record was held open, but she failed to provide any. Both accounts remain unresolved.
(Tr. 38-39, 61-62; SOR response at 3; AE 2-3)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a charged-off account with Suncoast Credit Union in the amount
of  $489.  Applicant  stated  that  she  contacted  the  creditor to  see  if  she  could  settle  the
account, or arrange a payment plan. She had not received a response from the creditor
as of the date of the hearing. This account remains unresolved. (Tr. 42-43)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a delinquent account with American Credit Union in the amount
of $27,059, the balance due after a vehicle was repossessed in about February 2021.
Applicant stated that this was for her motorcycle. When she received notification from her
employer that she would be relocated in State B, she voluntarily called the bank to have
the  motorcycle  repossessed.  At  the  hearing,  she  claimed  that  the  motorcycle  was
auctioned  and  the  proceeds  paid  the  outstanding  balance  in  full.  Department  Counsel
requested supporting documentation be submitted while the record was held open, and
Applicant  agreed.  No  documentation  was  submitted  and  this  account  has  not  been
resolved. (Tr. 25-29, 61; AE 4)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges a delinquent account with Fingerhut Webbank in the amount of
$216. Applicant testified that she had contacted the creditor to see if a settlement could
be arranged, or set-up a payment plan, but as of the date of the hearing, she had not
heard  from  the  creditor.  No  post-hearing  documentation  concerning  the  status  of  this
account was received. This account remains unresolved. (Tr. 42-43)
SOR  ¶  1.h  alleges  a  delinquent  account  with  Chrysler  Capital  in  the  amount  of
$21,313,  the  balance  due  after  a  vehicle  was  repossessed  in  about  October  2017.
Applicant stated that the document provided with her SOR response, a single page taken
from a credit report, showed that Chrysler Capital sold the account to another agency and
the balance reflected a zero. Applicant claimed that the loan balance of $21,313 was the
total  loan  balance,  and  not  the  actual  amount  of  approximately  $4,000  owed  after  the
vehicle  was  repossessed  and  later  auctioned.  She  also  stated  that  she  had  not  been
contacted by a collection agency pursuing the deficit loan balance. Department Counsel
requested supporting documentation be submitted while the record was held open, and
Applicant agreed. No documentation was submitted to support her claims. This account
has not been resolved.  (Tr. 43-44, 50-51; AE A)
Applicant  stated  that  she  and  her  spouse  have  worked  with  a  debt  resolution
agency in the past, but for “whatever reason”, they were dropped from the program. The
debt agency’s repayment schedule attached to her SOR response showed that the debts
alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  1.c,  and  1.g  were  the  same  amount  as  alleged  in  the  SOR  or
higher.  Applicant  testified  that  they  are  currently  working  with  a  new  debt  resolution
agency. She participated in financial counseling classes with her current bank, through
her  employer,  and  she  also  took  personal  finance  courses  while  attending  college.
Applicant offered to send supporting documentation to show that she was working with
the debt resolution agency to pay off their debts. She also stated that when her husband
returns  to  State  B  in  June  2022,  he  will  be  employed  at  a  new  job  with  a  significantly
higher salary. He is currently enrolled in school and their son will complete his school in
June 2022. Department Counsel asked Applicant to provide a monthly budget, to show
her current status, and also a monthly budget that incorporates her husband’s anticipated
earnings. Applicant did not provide any documentation. (AE A; Tr. 39, 45-46, 49-52, 56-
57, 65-68)
Applicant stated that their son is significantly disabled and has been through 86
surgeries  to  date.  State  A paid for his medical care until she  was  hired  by  her current
employer  in  February  2019.  Her  employer’s  insurance  now  covers  almost  all  of  his
medical costs, so they have “minimal copays” for their son’s medical care. (Tr. 57-58)
Applicant and her spouse received approximately a $3,000 to $4,000 federal tax
refund  last  year.  She used  the money  to  move  to  State  B.  She  also  admitted  that  her
employer provided her a moving stipend, but it did not cover “deposits” she was required
to pay in State B.  She also received this year’s tax refund of approximately $14,000. She
used  the  money  to  pay  some  late  car  payments  and  about  $5,000  of  unpaid  medical
expenses.  She  admitted  that  despite  the  April  2021  SOR  putting  her  on  notice  of  the
Government’s concerns about her financial issues, she did not use any money from their
combined 2020 and 2021 tax refunds totaling over $17,000 to voluntarily pay, settle, or
resolve any of the debts alleged in the SOR, which included six accounts under $800. (Tr.
59-61, 64-66)
Applicant  admitted  upon  questioning  that  she  had  a  delinquent  account  with
Verizon  in  the  amount  of  approximately  $3,000.  This  debt  developed  after  they  left
Verizon in January 2021, and the balance owed is for the devices that they kept. This
debt is not resolved. She did not think to mention this debt when specifically asked if she
had any other outstanding delinquent debts because she thought this debt was already
alleged  in  the  SOR.  Applicant  purchased  a  2020  vehicle  and  has  a  $600  monthly  car
payment, and her husband has a 2019 vehicle with a $500 monthly payment. She claimed
that she could not get a used vehicle with a lower monthly payment due to her poor credit
score. (Tr. 59-64, 68-71; AE B)
