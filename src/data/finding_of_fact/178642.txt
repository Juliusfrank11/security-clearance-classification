Applicant  is  38  years  old  and  has  never  been  married.  He  has  no  children.  He
graduated  from  high  school  in  2001.  He  has  worked  for  Federal  contractors  as  an
electronics technician since 2008. He wants to continue his education to prepare himself
for future responsibilities. He was granted a security clearance in 2009 and now seeks to
renew his clearance eligibility in relation to his employment. Without a clearance, he can
continue with his current employer, but his progress and opportunities at the company
would be limited. (Tr. at 39, 44-45.)
Paragraph 1  - Guideline J,  Criminal Conduct
The Government alleges, in this paragraph, six incidents involving criminal conduct
by  Applicant  over  the  period  March  2006  to  August  2020.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant
admitted each  of  the allegations,  but  in  two  instances  he also  denied  part  of  the  SOR
allegations. The specific details are as follows:
1.a. March 2006  traffic  citations  –   seat belt and no insurance.  On  March 10,
2006, Applicant was cited for two  driving  violations. He was 23  years old at the  time  and
was living  at his home  with  his mother. In  April 2006, he  pled  to  both  charges  and  was
fined   $85  for  the   seat  belt  violation   and  $1,040  for the   insurance   violation.  In   addition,
Applicant  failed   to   pay   the   assessed   fine   and   a   warrant   was  issued   in   July   2006.   In
October   2006,  the   court  set  aside   the   guilty   plea   and   fine   for   the   insurance   violation.
Applicant   paid  the   remaining   fine   in   full   on   November  27,  2006.   Applicant  presented
evidence  at the  hearing  showing  that he  now has  insurance  for his  vehicle.  He admitted
that he  acted  immaturely  at that time. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 15-17, 47; GE  9; Answer Ex. 5-
8; AE A.)
1.b. May  2008  possession of  marijuana  and driving an unregistered vehicle.
On  May  4,  2008,  Applicant  was  charged  with  drug  possession  and  operating  an
unregistered vehicle. In the summary of his background interview, Applicant is reported
as stating that the original drug charge was for a felony. The Government’s court records
reflect  that  this  charge  was  for  a  misdemeanor,  however,  no  police  records  were
submitted into evidence to permit a review of the original charge by the police. On June
17,  2008,  Applicant  pled  guilty  to  misdemeanor  marijuana  possession  and  was  fined.
Applicant testified that he no longer uses drugs and he does not  drink alcohol. His last
use of marijuana was in about 2008. He prefers to have a clear, focused mental condition.
He knows that marijuana use is legal under laws of the state in which he resides (State
1), but he also understands that Federal law and his work for the Federal Government
prohibit his use of marijuana. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 17-18, 46-47; GE 4 at 2; GE 8 at 1-4.)
1.c. January  2013  domestic  battery  arrest. Applicant admits he was arrested on
this charge, but he denies the underlying allegation of domestic battery. He had a physical
altercation with his then-girlfriend (Woman A) during an argument outside of a club, which
was observed by a police officer. In an affidavit, Woman A wrote that Applicant violently
pushed her. Applicant blames this arrest on a “toxic relationship” he had with the victim,
which he claimed was due to her mental illness. Applicant admitted both he and Woman
A  were  intoxicated  at  the  time  of  his  arrest.  He  testified  that  no  charges  were  filed.
Applicant and Woman A started dating in 2012 and separated in 2016. Applicant testified
that he has never had an issue of domestic abuse with any woman before or after the
one involved in this incident. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 18-19, 47-50; GE 2 at 4; GE 7 at 10.)
1.d. September 2016  restraining order due  to  domestic  violence. On July 18,
2016, Woman A obtained a temporary court restraining order for protection from Applicant
based upon her claims that applicant had physically abused her. Applicant believes that
she initiated the proceedings against him because he had terminated their relationship.
He testified that he was surprised that she sought the court order because he had never
been violent with her. The woman claimed in her court papers that she sought to leave
him and he reacted violently towards her. At the DOHA hearing, Applicant denied that he
had  ever  been  violent  with  her,  but  admitted  that  “we  [did]  tussle  together.”  The  court
papers were served on Applicant on August 15, 2016. A preliminary court date had been
continued on August 4, 2016, because Applicant had not been served at that time. The
SOR alleges that Applicant evaded service of the restraining order. This allegation was
based upon court papers reflecting five unsuccessful attempts to serve the court papers
on Applicant at his residence in State 1. In his Answer, Applicant admitted that the court
entered a restraining order against him, but he denies that he evaded service. He claimed
he was not aware of the order until it was served.  The restraining order was ultimately
dismissed on October 20, 2020, at the request of Woman A. (Answer at 2-3; Tr. at 19-20,
50-54, 61-64; GE 7 at 44, 49; Answer Ex. 1.)
1.e. May  2016  driving  citations  –   no  valid license  and tire  violation. Applicant
was issued a citation on March 14, 2016, He was ordered to appear in court on May 9,
2016 to respond to these charges.  He failed to appear in court. He finally appeared in
court on November 1, 2016. He pled guilty to failure to appear, and the driving infractions
were dismissed. He was fined $100 and was ordered to pay the fine in installments of
$35 per month commencing on December 1, 2016. Applicant failed to appear in court on
December  1,  2016,  to  pay  the  first  installment  of  the  fine  and  a  civil  assessment  was
ordered. Applicant testified that he was working in another state for an extended period
of time and upon his return to State 1, he resolved the citation. He began paying the fine
in January 2018 and finished paying it in October 2018. He was unable to explain why he
did not have a valid driver’s license at the time of the citation. He described generally that
his driver’s  license  had  been  suspended  at some  time  due  to his failures  to appear in
court. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 21-23, 54-56; GE 6 at 3-6; Answer Ex. 2-4.)
1.f. August 2019  – traffic  citation for  speeding (86/65).
On October 22, 2019,
Applicant failed to appear in court to respond to a speeding citation. The court docket in
the record reflects that he failed to appear in court again on November 7, 2019, February
11,  2020,  and  August  14,  2020.  The  docket  also  shows  that  he  appeared  in  court  on
February 21, 2020, and pled  not guilty. Applicant claims that he appeared at the initial
court hearing and requested a trial. He went to court for the trial and the courthouse was
closed due to the COVID pandemic. He testified that he never heard further about a court
date. His employer subsequently relocated him to State 2 for an extended period of time
to manage a project. He claimed he was unaware of  the warrant until he received the
SOR. He wrote in his Answer that he intends to go to court and address the citation and
warrant. As of December 30, 2020, the amount of the unpaid fine was $882. At the DOHA
hearing, he provided evidence of payment of the fine in the amount of $1,010 on May 23,
2022, a week before the hearing. Applicant testified that he now understands that he can
hire an attorney to represent him in any future legal problems and avoid  missing court
dates when he is away from home due to his work responsibilities. He admitted that he
had been irresponsible missing the November 2019 court date. (Answer 3; Tr. at 23-25,
56-59; GE 5 at 1-3; AE C.)
Paragraph 2  - Guideline F, Financial Considerations
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because of his unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, raising questions about
his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. The
SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  failed  to  file  his  Federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  as
required for tax years (TYs) 2016, 2018, 2019, and 2020 (SOR 2.a). The SOR also alleges
that  Applicant failed  to pay his State 1 fine  and  penalties  in  connection  with  the  traffic
citation alleged in SOR 1.f (SOR 2.b). The specific details are as follows:
2.a.  Failure   to   timely   file   Federal  and  state  taxes.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant
admitted that he failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2016 and
2018 through 2020 in a timely manner. He asserted that the returns have now been filed.
At the hearing, Applicant explained that his failures to file his returns was “mostly” due to
his  work-related  travel  schedule  for  extended  periods  of  time.  His  exhibits  include
unsigned copies of his Federal tax returns for TY 2018 and 2020 that were prepared by
a  tax  professional.  The  TY  2018  return  is  undated  and  reflects  a  balance  due  in  the
amount of $3,792 and the TY 2020 return reflects a refund due to Applicant in the amount
of $731. The TY 2020 tax return is dated July 14, 2021, which would have been about
two  months  late  in  the  absence  of  an  extension  to  file  past  the  due  date,  which  was
extended  to  May  17,  2021,  for  that  tax  year  due  to  the  COVID  pandemic.  Applicant
provided no documentary evidence that he filed for an extension in 2021. He testified that
the  other  tax  returns  were  filed  in  about  September  2021,  after  he  received  the  SOR.
Given  the  limited  information  in  the  record, counsel  for the  Government  and  Applicant
stipulated to Applicant’s testimony that his tax returns for TYs 2016, 2018-2020 were filed,
but they were not filed on time. Applicant testified that he intends to file his returns in a
timely manner in the future using the services of a tax professional. (Answer at 4; Tr. at
26, 64-; GE 2 at 5; AE D through I.)
Applicant testified further that he entered into a payment plan  in 2021 to pay his
Federal tax debt of about $4,000 for TY 2018.  He pays the Federal Government about
$200  per  month.  He  also  had  a  tax  liability  to  State  1  for  the  same  year.  The  state
garnished his wages to collect that debt. He has now fully paid the state tax debt. With
interest and penalties, his total Federal and state tax debt for 2018 was about $9,000.
This liability arose due to Applicant withdrawing funds from his 401k account in 2018 to
pay off a car loan and a credit card. (Tr. at 69-74.)
2.b.  Failure  to  pay  State 1  fine and penalties.  Applicant asserted in his Answer
that he has retained an attorney to address the underlying infraction and fine. As noted in
the discussion of the facts surrounding SOR 1.f, above, Applicant provided evidence that
he paid this fine of about $1,000 on May 23, 2022, shortly before the hearing date of June
1, 2022. He testified that he did not pay this fine earlier because he was unaware of it
prior to receiving the SOR. (Answer at 4; Tr. at 73-74; GE 5 at 2; AE C.)
Paragraph 3  - Guideline  E, Personal Conduct
The Government cross-alleges in this paragraph all of the allegations set forth in
paragraphs  1  and  2  of  the  SOR.  The  SOR  states  that  conduct  involving  questionable
judgment or an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations raises questions about
an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to  protect  classified  or  sensitive
information. In his Answer, Applicant denied that his personal conduct demonstrates an
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. (Answer at 4.)
Mitigation
The Director of Operations of Applicant’s employer and security clearance sponsor
provided  a  strong  character  reference  praising  Applicant’s  reliability  and  good  moral
character. The character reference described Applicant as “dependable, responsible, and
honest.” (Tr. at 12; AE J.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  began  working  for  his  current  employer  in  February
2022.  He  manages  large  and  important  contracts  for  one  of  the  U.S.  military  services
installing technical equipment, which requires experience, skills, scheduling, and project
planning. He worked for his prior employer for about three years and another employer
for about ten years before that. Both of his prior jobs and his current employment involved
the same type of Defense Department contract work. In his last job, he lived and worked
in State 2. Starting in about 2019 he began working as a team lead, and more recently
he managed about 30 technicians. Applicant worked ten or more hours a day, six days a
week. He was voted “Employee of the Year.” His good work for that company opened the
opportunity he has with his current employer. In his new job, he will be managing a team
of  about  60  technicians.  Applicant  is  a  relatively  young  person  to  have  so  much
responsibility. In his new position as a manager, he has more responsibility and his pay
is accordingly higher. Over the years, his hourly pay rate has increased from $14.50 to
about $45. His new position also requires him to work long hours with much overtime. His
income increased to well over $100,000 in 2021. (Tr. at 27-37, 42-43.)
The Defense Department contracts on which Applicant works often require him to
be on site in another state for long periods of  time. As a result, when he is residing in
State 1, he lives with his mother. He testified that this situation was the main reason why
he missed court dates and did not file his taxes in a timely manner. He also admitted that
he has been irresponsible in the past, but claims that behavior has changed. He believes
that  he  has  shown  “tremendous  growth  since  those  situations  [alleged  in  the  SOR]
happen[ed]. They have all been taken care of. And they are all things that will not occur
again.” (Tr. at 28-36, 76.)
Applicant has learned from his employment the importance of planning and taking
care of both his work requirements and those of his personal life. He realizes he can no
longer afford to be irresponsible in his handling of his personal affairs. He claims he is
now much more responsible than he has ever been. He understands that the four most
recent incidents listed under Guideline J, and both of the financial issues alleged under
Guideline  F,  arose  while  he  held  a  security  clearance.  His  receipt  of  the  SOR  has
prompted him to reexamine how he has handled his taxes and other legal responsibilities.
Applicant understands that he has a highly supportive attorney who has known him since
his childhood and is available to take care of any legal problems Applicant encounters.
Applicant now also has a tax professional to file his income tax returns every year in a
timely fashion. Applicant’s 2021 tax returns were filed prior to the filing deadline  in April
2022.  He  also  commented  that  he  has  not  been  arrested  or  given  a  citation  since  the
2019 speeding incident. (Tr. at 29-38, 59.)
Applicant is determined to avoid repeating the tumultuous relationship he had with
Woman A for four years (2012 to 2016). He is now in a stable relationship with a woman
he  wants  to  marry.  He  and  his  girlfriend  plan  to  raise  a  family  together.  She  has  a
doctorate degree in physical therapy. They presently have no difficult relationship issues,
but they are engaged in counseling to help them learn to communicate better and avoid
issues that can be disruptive to their relationship. He now invests his money rather than
going out with his friends. He has a good credit score. Applicant and his girlfriend look
forward to buying a house one day. (Tr. at 38-41.)
