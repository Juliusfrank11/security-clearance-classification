The SOR alleges foreign influence security concerns based on Applicant’s mother-
in-law (SOR ¶ 1.a.), sister-in-law, and four brothers-in-law (who are citizens and residents
of Iraq). (SOR ¶ 1.b.) In his response to SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations
under  Guideline  B.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a
careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  hearing  transcript,  and  exhibits,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact:
Applicant  is  48  years  old.  He  was  born  in  Mosul,  Iraq,  and  he  obtained  his
bachelor’s  degree  in  that  country  in  1997.  He  entered  the  United  States  illegally  in
December  2001,  and  he  was  held  in  a  detention  center  by  U.S.  immigration  until  his
hearing in May 2002. He requested political asylum at his hearing due to threats and three
detainments by members of the Ba’ath Party, of which he was not a member. His asylum
was granted. Beginning in March 2007, he served in the U.S. Army National Guard as a
military translator with the rank of Specialist (E-4). He deployed to Iraq in October 2008,
and  returned  to  the  U.S.  in  June  2009.  He  received  an  honorable  discharge  in  March
2010. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2009. His current translator employment
offer  with  a  federal  contractor  is  contingent  based  on  his  eligibility  for  a  DOD  security
clearance. (GE 1, GE 2, GE 3; Tr. 18-23, 30-31, 52-53)
Applicant was hired by a federal contractor for a linguist position in August 2006
and was terminated in February 2007. He told his supervisor that he needed to be moved
to  another  military  base  in  Iraq  because  the  current  base  was  too  dangerous.  His
supervisor told him he was needed at that base, but Applicant told him he could not stay
there. Applicant was fired by his employer and sent home. He was also hired by another
federal  contractor  in  March  2010  to  work  in  Iraq  as  a  translator.  He  was  fired  by  his
employer in August 2010, for violation of company policy and creating a hostile workplace.
Applicant admitted he was aware that he was not to have any type of relationship with
any foreign nationals in Iraq, but he became romantically involved with an Iraqi woman.
They  discussed  becoming  engaged  and  eventually  married.  He  failed  to  report  his
relationship to his employer. (Tr. 53-59; GE 2, GE 3)
In September 2010, he travelled to Damascus, Syria after his family arranged a
marriage for him with an Iraqi woman. He married his new wife in Syria and sponsored
her  for  a  Visa  to  the  U.S.,  which  she  entered  in  June  2011.  When  questioned  by
Department Counsel as to why he chose to travel to Syria to arrange a marriage with an
Iraqi woman rather than marry a U.S. citizen, Applicant stated “in our culture, you have to
marry [someone from the same tribe].” His wife is now a naturalized U.S. citizen, and they
have two daughters, ages seven and ten months. His wife returned to Iraq to visit family
in 2012 and 2015. He and his wife returned to Iraq in 2017 to attend the marriage of his
brother-in-law. They stayed at his mother-in-law’s house. (Tr. 18-19, 24-29, 31-32, 43-44,
58-59)
Applicant’s mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Iraq. During his background
interview in October 2017, he told the authorized DOD investigator that he had contact
with her two times per week via telephone. He and his spouse regularly send her financial
assistance,  about  $250  every  three  or  four  months.  She  occasionally  works  as  a
housekeeper and is not affiliated with the Iraqi government or military. (Tr. 28, 36-37, 42,
50-51)
Applicant’s  spouse’s  two   older  brothers   (B-in-law  1  and  2)  are  citizens  and
residents of Iraq. During his background interview in October 2017, he told the authorized
DOD investigator that he and his wife have contact with them about every two or three
months. One of her brothers is employed as a soldier with the Nineveh Protection Unit
(NPU), which is affiliated with the Iraqi military. One  of his wife’s  younger brothers (B-in-
law 3) moved to Canada and married in 2019. He is an Iraqi citizen currently residing in
Canada. Her other younger brother (B-in-law 4) and her sister (S-in-law) are citizens and
residents of Iraq. Applicant reported to the investigator that he and his wife have contact
with these family members weekly, and they are not affiliated with any foreign government
or  military.  The   investigator  questioned   Applicant  as  to   why   he   failed   to   list  his  wife’s
siblings on the security clearance application (SCA) or during his counterintelligence (CI)
interview  in  August  2017.  Applicant  stated  that  he  intentionally  failed  to  report  these
individuals because he did not want his security clearance investigation to take any longer
than necessary. (GE 1, GE 2, GE 3; Tr. 37-41)

Applicant  was  interviewed  again  by  two  DOD  authorized  investigators  in  June
2018. There were discrepant facts reported in his previous background investigations that
required  additional  information.  During  the  course  of  the  interview,  the  reporting
investigator  noticed  that  Applicant  was  getting  irritable  with  their  questions.  Applicant
repeatedly stated that the investigators were asking too many questions. Also, on a few
occasions, he extended his arm and pointed his finger very close to an investigator’s face,
stating  in  a  very  loud  voice,  “You’re  asking  too  many  questions.”  At  one  point  during
questioning, the investigator abruptly stopped the interview after Applicant got up from
his chair shouting and displaying aggressive behavior. Applicant was told that if he did
not calm down, he would be escorted out of the facility. He was also given a ten-minute
break to get his emotions under control before the interview continued. Applicant received
the investigative reports from both background interviews. He certified with his signature
that the investigative records were reported accurately. (GE 2; Tr. 46-50)
Administrative Notice
I have taken administrative notice of the following facts concerning Iraq:
The Federal Republic of Iraq (Iraq) is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The
U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens not to travel to Iraq due to terrorism and
armed conflict. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for violence and kidnapping. Numerous
terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq and regularly attack both Iraqi security
forces  and  civilians.  The  Islamic  State  in  Iraq  and  Syria  (ISIS),  a  designated  terrorist
organization,  remains a  threat to public safety in  Iraq.  Additionally,  criminal gangs and
local militia pose a potential threat to U.S. citizens. In February 2018, the U.S. Director of
National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that, given the ongoing presence of ISIS and Iran-
supported militants, Iraq will likely face a lengthy period of political turmoil and conflict.
(AN I)
Iraq’s  most  significant  human  rights  abuses  are  largely  fueled  by  the  terrorist
activities of ISIS; however, some Iraqi security forces were alleged to have engaged in
unlawful  killings,  disappearances  and  extortion,  torture,  life-threatening  conditions  in
detention and prison facilities, and arbitrary arrest and detention. (AN I)
The United States’ commitment to Iraq is balanced against the inherent dangers
of the ongoing conflict in Iraq to its citizens and residents from terrorists and significant
human rights issues. (AN 1)
