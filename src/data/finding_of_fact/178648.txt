Financial Considerations
Applicant and his spouse timely filed their joint tax return for TY 2015; however,
they owed $864. (GE 3 at 19) They had a payment plan with the IRS and resolved their
TY 2015  tax debt on April 24, 2017.  (GE 3 at  20) SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  allege, and he
admitted, that he did not file a federal or state income tax return for TYs 2017 and 2018.
(Tr. 26-30, 34-35, 49; SOR response) When he was preparing his tax returns for those
two tax years, he noticed that he owed a substantial amount for taxes; he did not have
the funds available to pay the taxes; and he decided not to file the two tax returns. (Tr.
30-31) Applicant and his spouse were earning about $100,000, and when his spouse lost
her job  in  2019,  the family income  went  down  to  about  $60,000.  (Tr.  23,  31,  37;  SOR
response) In addition, she failed to withhold sufficient funds from her income for federal
income taxes, and they were unable to pay their federal income taxes when due for TY
2017 and 2018. (Tr. 23-26) They filed their federal and state tax returns for TYs 2019,
2020, and 2021. (Tr. 33, 35; AE A-AE C) They received refunds for each of those three
tax years. (AE A-AE C)
Applicant’s current gross annual salary is about $65,000. (Tr. 38; GE  3 at 7) He
said he lacked the income to address the delinquent debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e,
which allege Applicant has a collection debt for $4,121, a collection debt for $2,200, and
a charged-off debt for $1,986. (Tr. 38) He lives paycheck to paycheck. (Tr. 43) He has
little savings and sometimes needs to borrow from family. (Tr. 42)
Applicant hoped that his wife would find employment outside their home, and then
they could pay their SOR debts and some non-SOR debts such as a car loan, a signature
loan, and their mortgage. (Tr. 43-46) He is planning to receive financial counseling, file
his tax returns for TYs 2017 and 2018, and establish a payment plan to pay the taxes
owed. (Tr. 47, 50)
