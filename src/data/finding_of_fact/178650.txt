Applicant is 39 years-old, divorced and has five children. (Item 2) She completed
a  security  clearance  application  on  December  22,  2015.  (Item  3)  Applicant  attended
college courses, but she has not received a degree. She has held a security clearance
since 2016. Applicant reports no military service. She is being sponsored by a defense
contractor for a security clearance. (Item 5)
In 2015, when Applicant signed her security clearance application, she was using
the last name of Munoz. In 2020, when she obtained the services of the debt resolution
company, she used the last name Munoz. The name Munoz appears to be her mother’s
last  name.  (Item  3)  On  Applicant’s  2021  credit  bureau  report,  her  consumer  name  is
Munoz and her other name is Coronel.  (Item 8) From the record it appears that in 2022,
Applicant’s  last  name  was  Coronel.  This  last  name  is  also  on  her  2022  credit  bureau
report. (Item 9) The files in this case reflect both names.
Financial
The  SOR  from  December  2021,  alleged  that  Applicant  has  about  $29,961  in
delinquent  debt  for  19  accounts,  and  a  chapter  7  bankruptcy  that  was  discharged  in
2014.  (Items  1,7,  10)  The  allegations  in  the  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.t  are  supported  by
Applicant’s 2020 and 2021 credit bureau reports. (Items 7, 8, 9) She admitted 15 of the
SOR allegations and denied four alleged accounts. Applicant claimed in her answer to
the SOR that those accounts were paid.
Applicant  attributed  her  financial  difficulties  to  a  two  income  family  reduced  to
one income. Her husband at the time suffered a heart attack in 2015, and he could not
work for several months. Applicant became the sole provider and she used credit cards
to  pay  household  bills  including  rent  and  food.  In  2016,  Applicant’s  husband  suffered
another  heart  attack.  Applicant  filed  for  divorce  in  2020  and  moved  out  of  the  house
with her five children. (Item 2)
In  May  2019,  a  continuing  evaluation  (CE)  report  was  issued  to  Applicant’s
employer  stating  that  Applicant  had  13  delinquent  accounts  totaling  $18,229.  (Item  4)
She  also  had  a  $4,000  judgment  against  her.  (Item  11)  The  judgment  is  the  same  as
SOR allegation 1.o for $4,608. She then reported the judgment to her FSO. On January
20, 2021, another CE report was issued to Applicant’s employer. (Item 6) This CE report
showed  $21,095  in delinquent  debt  which  Applicant had  not  disclosed.  (Item 6) At the
time, Applicant stated that she was utilizing a debt relief program. (Item 5)
In  August  2020,  Applicant  signed  a  debt  resolution  agreement for  enrolled  debt
$21,479.  (Item  2)  The  term  was  for  48  months.  Applicant  submitted  the  signed
agreement and proof that she has paid $146 bi-weekly (as a program deposit amount)
to the debt relief company since October 2020. Applicant was advised to stop paying all
debt so that settlement amounts could be negotiated. (Item 2) There were 15 accounts
enrolled in the plan.
Applicant  submitted  a  screen  shot  of  the  four  accounts  that  she  denied  in  her
answer to the SOR (1.b, 1.d, 1.i, and 1.t), noting in her handwriting that those accounts
were paid in full. She did not state the amount of settlement for each  of  the accounts.
However, her latest credit report reflects a payment on  the four debts which amount to
$5,746 (19% of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR). (Item 9) Applicant claims that
settlement  agreements  have  been  reached  on  four  other  accounts,  but  she  did  not
submit evidence to substantiate her claim. (Item 2)
As to the 2014 chapter 7 bankruptcy that was discharged in the amount of about
$18,000 for consumer debt, she explained in her security clearance application that she
was not financially able to provide for her children and pay her previous debts. (Item 3)
The record reflects that Applicant has a total net monthly income of $2,800. Her
total  monthly  expenses  are  $2,700.  She  has  a  monthly  disposable  income  of  $100.
(Item 2) There is no record of financial counseling. (Item 2)
