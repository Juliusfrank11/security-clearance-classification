Applicant is 32 years old and single. She graduated from high school in 2007 and
took some college courses in 2009 and 2010 and again in 2012 and 2013, but she has
not  yet  earned  a  degree.  Since  October  2017,  she  has  been  employed  by  a  defense
contractor assigned to work at a military installation. She was recently promoted to be a
quality assurance coordinator. She is about to begin a second job as a part-time delivery
driver.  She  is  a  first-time  applicant  for  a  security  clearance  and  is  seeking  to  obtain  a
clearance in relation to her employment with the defense contractor. (Tr. at 4, 15-16, 24,
41, 45.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she is
financially  overextended  with  delinquent  debts  and  therefore  potentially  unreliable,
untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
The  SOR identifies  ten  past-due  or charged-off  debts  owed  by  Applicant totaling
about $15,600   (SOR 1.c  through   1.l).  Her two   largest  debts   are  for delinquent   student
loans  totaling  about $13,000  (SOR 1.k and  1.l). The  SOR  also  alleges that  she  failed  to
file  her Federal and  state  tax  returns in tax  years (TYs) 2010, 2011, 2013, and  2014  (SOR
1.a  and  1.b).  In  her  Answer, Applicant  admitted  all  of the  SOR allegations. The  existence
and   amounts   of  these   debts  is   also   supported   by   credit  reports   in  the   record  dated
September 28, 2019,  and February 15, 2022. (GE  3 and  4.)
The current status of the SOR allegations is as follows:
1.a  and 1.b. Failure to file Federal and state tax returns for TYs 2010, 2011, 2013
and 2014. Due to the passage of time, Applicant was unable to explain at the hearing why
she failed to file tax returns for the four years in question. Applicant was able to locate the
documentation she needed to file for TY 2014. In early 2022 she mailed her Federal and
state tax returns for that year. She owed no additional taxes for TY 2014. Applicant has
received a notice from the IRS that she owes about $1,600 in back taxes for TY 2016.
She intends to enter into a payment plan with the IRS to pay this delinquent tax debt. She
is currently paying past-due state taxes pursuant to a recent voluntary payment plan she
negotiated,  which  provides  for  the  automatic  withdrawal  of  $100  from  her  biweekly
paychecks. She is uncertain what tax year is being paid under this plan.  The state tax
debt is about $500. She has timely filed all of her returns for TYs after 2015 and has an
extension to file her TY 2021 returns. (Tr. at 17-22.)
With respect to TY 2010, 2011, and 2013, Applicant has been unable to reach an
IRS  employee  to  obtain  the  needed  information  for  the  prior  years.  The  IRS  phone
message  states  that  tax  information  is only available  for TYs  2018  and  later.  She  has
considered seeking help from the tax professional who prepared her most recent returns,
but has not yet done so. She noted that she was a full-time student in 2009 and 2010 and
had no income. (Tr. at 17-24.)
1.c. Collection debt in the amount of about $315. This debt is for a payday loan
account that Applicant opened in 2017 or 2018 and could not repay. Before she applied
for a security clearance, she contacted this creditor and tried to resolve the debt with a
payment plan. The collection agency refused and demanded full payment. Since then she
has not repaid this loan. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 24, 26-27.)
1.d. Collection debt in the amount of about $377.  This debt is owed for internet
services and unreturned equipment. Applicant could not pay the original creditor in about
2016 or 2017. The collection agency for the creditor demanded full payment of the debt,
which Applicant could not pay. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 27-28.)
1.e. Collection debt in the amount of about $172. This debt is also owed for internet
services and unreturned equipment. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 28-30.)
1.f.  Collection  debt  in  the  amount  of  about  $178.  Applicant  testified  that  this
account is with the same creditor and the same collection agency as the debt in SOR 1.e,
but it is not a duplicate of SOR 1.e. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 30-31.)
1.g Delinquent  medical debt in  the  amount of $1,168. This debt  is for emergency
room medical services in 2017  or 2018. Applicant’s  insurance  company  paid its share of
the  bill, and  the  unpaid  balance  is Applicant’s share of the  bill. The  creditor refused  to
accept  partial payments pursuant to  a  payment plan. This debt is not resolved. (Tr.  at 31-
32.)
1.h  Delinquent  medical  debt  in  the  amount  of  $2,044.  This  debt  is  for  medical
services. Applicant is unsure what services are covered by this bill. Applicant has not paid
this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 32.)
1.i.  Collection  debt  in  the  amount  of  about  $202.  This  debt  is  for  a  pet  medical
insurance policy that Applicant was unable to pay. The creditor demanded a payment for
the  full  amount  of  the  debt,  and  Applicant  could  not  afford  to  pay  it.  This  debt  is  not
resolved. (Tr. at 32-33.)
1.j. Collection debt in the amount of about $94.  Applicant is uncertain about the
nature of this debt, and she has not paid the creditor. This debt is not resolved.  (Tr. at
33.)
1.k Student loan debt in the amount of about $4,770 placed for collection. Applicant
initially tried to repay this student loan with small payments, but was unable to continue
paying it. She has not tried to rehabilitate the student loan and begin paying on normal
payment terms. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 34, 42.)
1.l   Student  loan  debt  in  the  amount  of  about  $8,101  placed  for  collection.  The
current status of this debt is the same as the debt in SOR 1.k. This debt is not resolved.
(Tr. at 34.)
Government  Exhibit  3,  the  most  recent  credit  report  in  the  record,  lists  three
additional delinquent debts. One is a credit-card debt in the amount of $578. This account
was opened in 2019 and was sold to a collection agency in November 2021. The second
debt  is  also  for  a  credit-card  account  that  was  opened  by  Applicant’s  mother  under
Applicant’s name. The amount of the delinquent debt is $658. Her mother has agreed to
repay this debt. Applicant is also delinquent on her car loan. She is paying that delinquent
debt and has retained possession of the car. (Tr. at 34-38; GE 3 at 4-6.)
Mitigation
Applicant admitted that she was irresponsible with her credit when she was young.
She would take out loans to pay debts and then be unable to repay the loans. Applicant
testified about her plan to pay the debts she believes she owes. She recently received a
promotion and a pay raise and has just begun working at a second job that permits her
to work flexible part-time hours. She now has the additional income to begin paying her
debts and repairing her credit in the future. (Tr. at 25-26.)
Applicant  has  not sought financial counseling  though  her mother  has encouraged
her to  talk to  a  counselor at Applicant’s  bank.  After she  pays her monthly  living  expenses,
she  has little  or no  money  left over. She  expects to  make  a  gross amount of  about  $600
per week working  at her second  job  and  intends to  use  that  money  to  begin paying  down
her debts.  She  hopes to  pay  off  her debts by  the  end  of 2022,  with  the  exception  of  her
student loans, which are  too  large  to  repay  without a  payment schedule.  (Tr. at 34-35, 38-
43.)
