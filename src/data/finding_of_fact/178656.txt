Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  March  2020.  He  has  been  continuously  employed  since
2008. He earned a bachelor’s degree  in 2013. He served on active duty with the U.S.
Army  from  1997  until  2006,  when  he  was  awarded  an  honorable  discharge.  Applicant
has been married and divorced three times. His marriages were from 1999 until 2000,
from 2003 until 2004, and from 2005 until 2012.  He has one minor child and one adult
child. Applicant has been awarded a clearance at least three times in the past. (Items 2,
3, 4, 5)
Under  Guideline  F,  the  Government  alleged  in  its  SOR  that  Applicant  had  10
delinquent debts totaling about $63,500. Applicant’s delinquent debts consisted of child-
support payments due to State A, credit cards, and personal loans. Applicant admitted
all  the  debts  described  in  the  SOR.  He  claimed  that  he  has  either  paid  or  is  making
monthly payments on all these debts with the exception of the debt listed in SOR ¶ 1.h.
He alleged that the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h  is an  “old  debt” that he  needs to  have  removed
from his credit report. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. Applicant alleged
that his financial issues arose as a result of his having to pay more than he could afford
for medical  bills  in  about  mid-2019.  As  of  late  2019,  he  has  been  working  with  a  debt
consolidation  company in  order to  resolve  his delinquent  debts.  The  Guideline  F  SOR
allegations  are  established  through  the  Government’s  evidence  and  Applicant’s
admissions. (Items 1-4, 6-8)
The $7,880 child-support debt to State A listed in SOR ¶ 1.a has been resolved
through  payments.  Applicant  presented  documentary  evidence  in  his  response  to  the
SOR that, in March 2021, he made three payments on this debt for a combined total of
$3,700. His 2022 credit report reflects that this account is current. (Items 1-4, 6, 8)
The $23,764 personal loan listed in SOR ¶ 1.b, has not been resolved. Applicant
claimed that he has been making payments on this debt since late 2019 and that he has
satisfied it. He provided what may be documents from his debt consolidation company
purportedly  showing  that  he  has  made  24  of  24  settlement  payments  on  this  debt.
However, his 2022 credit report still shows this debt as charged off with a last payment
date in March 2019. He provided no documents from the creditor showing the debt has
been  resolved.  Moreover,  his  documents  that  may  be  from  his  debt  consolidation
company  lack  sufficient  context  such  as  the  amounts  of  the  alleged  payments  or  an
agreement with the creditor to conclude the debt has been satisfied. (Items 1-4, 6-8)
The personal loan and credit-card debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.i have been
resolved.  Applicant  claimed  that  he  has  been  making  payments  on  these  debts  since
late 2019 and that he has satisfied them. He provided what may be documents from his
debt  consolidation  company  showing  settlement  payments  made  on  these  debts.  His
2022 credit report corroborates that these debts have been settled for less than the full
amount. (Items 1, 2, 4, 6-8)
The  credit-card  debts  listed  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.d,  1.e,  and  1.f  have  been  partially
resolved  through  payments.  Applicant  claimed  that  he  has  been  making  payments  on
these  debts  since  late  2019.  He  provided  documents  that  may  be  from  his  debt
consolidation  company  purportedly  showing  the  number  of  monthly  settlement
payments  he  has  made  on  these  debts.  Applicant’s  2022  credit  report  confirms  that
payments have been made on these accounts, as the balance on each of them is lower
than those listed on his 2021 credit report. (Items 1, 2, 4, 6-8)
The  credit  card  debt  listed  in  SOR  ¶  1.g  has  the  same  account  number  and
original creditor as the credit card account in SOR ¶ 1.d. It is a duplicate account and is
therefore resolved. (Items 1, 2, 4, 6-8)
The  $4,040  automobile  loan  debt  listed  in  SOR  ¶  1.h  has  not  been  resolved.
Applicant  told  the  investigator  during  his  March  2020  clearance  interview  that  he  had
paid  this  debt  years  ago.  In  his  response  to  the  SOR,  he  claimed  that  he  needed  to
have  the  debt  removed  from  his credit  report and  that it  was “not on  my  records that I
could find.” Applicant presented no documentary evidence that he has made a payment,
disputed this debt, offered or negotiated a payment agreement, or taken any significant
action to resolve this debt. This debt does not appear on Applicant’s 2021 or 2022 credit
reports. (Items 1, 4, 5, 6)
The $1,507 credit-card debt listed in SOR ¶ 1.j has not been resolved. Applicant
claimed  that  he  has  made  payments  on  this  debt  and  that  he  has  satisfied  it.  He
provided  what  may  be  documents  from  his  debt  consolidation  company  purportedly
showing  that  he  has  made  his  settlement  payment  on  this  debt.  However,  his  2022
credit report still shows this debt as charged off with a last payment date in April 2019.
He  provided  no  documents  from  the  creditor  showing  the  debt  has  been  resolved.
Moreover,  his  documents  that  may  be  from  his  debt  consolidation  company  lack
sufficient  context  such  as  the  amounts  of  the  alleged  payments  or an  agreement  with
the creditor to conclude the debt has been satisfied. (Items 1, 2, 4, 7, 8)
As  evidenced  by  his  2014  clearance  interview,  Applicant  had  delinquent  debts
when  that  interview  was  conducted.  Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM,  so  more
recent information regarding his finances is not available. (Item 5)
On  about  December  3,  2019,  the  sheriff’s  department  in  County  A  charged
Applicant with destruction of property, entering property to damage, and dumping trash
on  a  highway  or  private  property,  all  misdemeanors.  These  charges  were  dismissed.
Later in December 2019, a court in County A issued a protective order against Applicant
in  favor  of  another  individual.  A  court’s  entry  of  a  protective  order  may  indicate  that  it
found  instances  of  criminal  behavior.  However,  there  is  insufficient  evidence  in  the
record  to  establish  that  this  protective  order  was  entered  based  upon  Applicant’s
criminal behavior. This protective order was dismissed in September 2020. (Items 1, 2,
4, 9, 10)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  aforementioned  criminal
charges  and  the  protective  order  that  a  court  entered  against  him  under  Guideline  J.
(Items 1, 2, 4, 9, 10)
Despite being required to do so, Applicant failed to disclose his aforementioned
criminal  charges  on  the  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  he  submitted  in
January 2020  (January 2020  SF  86). While  he  admitted  that  he  failed  to  disclose  this
information  in  his  January  2020  SF  86,  he  claimed  this  omission  was  unintentional
because  he  was  not  “arrested”  when  he  was  criminally  charged.  An  incident  report
related  to  these  criminal  charges  was  created  in  February  2020,  however,  there  is
insufficient  evidence  to  conclude  that  Applicant  was  confronted  with  his  failure  to
disclose  these  criminal  charges  in  his  January  2020  SF  86.  He  did  not  discuss  these
criminal  charges  during  his  March  2020  clearance  interview,  however,  his  investigator
did not confront him with these criminal charges. Applicant disclosed these charges on
the Questionnaire for National Security Positions he submitted in June 2020 (June 2020
SF 86) before being confronted. (Items 1-4, 9, 10)
In  the  SOR, the  Government alleged  Applicant’s failure to  disclose  these  criminal
charges in his January 2020 SF 86  under Guideline  E. (Items 1-4, 9, 10)
While Applicant disclosed the delinquent debt listed in SOR ¶ 1.a in his January
2020  SF  86,  he  was  also  required  to  report  the  SOR  debts  listed  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b-1.j.
Applicant therefore failed to disclose all of the delinquent debts that  he was required to
on  his  January  2020  SOR.  An  incident  report  related  to  these  financial  delinquencies
was created in February 2020, however, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that
Applicant was confronted with his failure to disclose these delinquencies in his January
2020  SF  86.  Applicant  disclosed  several  of  these  SOR  and  other  delinquent  debts
during his March 2020 clearance interview before being confronted by his investigator.
Applicant  also  disclosed  many  of  these  SOR  and  other  delinquent  debts  in  his  June
2020  SF 86. In his response  to the  SOR,  Applicant admitted that he failed to disclose
SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.j in his January 2020 SOR, but referenced his efforts to pay or otherwise
satisfy those debts, alluding to his understanding that those debts were not delinquent.
(Items 1-4, 6-8, 10)
In  the  SOR,  under  Guideline  E,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  failure  to
disclose all of the SOR debts he was required to in his January 2020 SF 86. (Items 1-4,
6-8, 10)
