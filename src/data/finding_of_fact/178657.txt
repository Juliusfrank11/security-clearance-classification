The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  nine  separate  creditors  for
delinquent  accounts  totaling  in  excess  of  $113,000,  which  include  collections,  charge
offs, and vehicle repossessions.  In his answer, Applicant admits each of the allegations
set  forth  in  the  SOR.  Credit  reports  of  the Applicant  dated  June  25,  2021;  March  16,
2022; and June 1, 2022, confirm this indebtedness.  (Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5.)
Applicant testified that until COVID 19 and its aftermath, he paid his bills on time
and  had  no  financial  problems.  His  financial  problems  began  in  January  or  February
2020.  His  employer  downsized  due  to  COVID  19.  He  lost  his  job  and  had  to  go  on
unemployment.  His  salary  to  support  his  family  went  from  $90,000  annually  to
unemployment benefits.  Two weeks after he lost his job, his wife was laid  off from her
job.  This had  a huge impact on his family.  For about six or seven months, Applicant
and  his  wife  supported  their  family  on  unemployment  benefits.  This  included  making
their  mortgage  payment,  and  paying  the  necessities  to  survive.  Many  bills  became
delinquent.
Applicant  explained  that  he  grew up  in  a  family  that  bought  and  sold  cars  as  a
hobby,  and  used  it  as  a  way  of  making  extra  money  to  support  the  family.  Applicant
chose exotic cars or cars he knew were underpriced, but highly desirable.  He would fix
them up, added a special attraction to make them original, (for example, enhancing the
stereo system, changing the wheels), and then flipped them.  (Tr. p. 25.)  Sometimes he
made as much as a $10,000 profit on one sale.  On average, he earned about $30,000
a  year  selling  cars  this  way.
(Tr.  p.  30.)  Applicant  learned  the  craft  from  his
grandfather, and father who used to do the same thing.  When Applicant lost his job, he
could not make the payments on several of the cars he had purchased  and they were
repossessed.
Applicant  knew  that  once  he  went  back  to  work,  he  could  pull  equity  out  of  his
house, which he knew to be about $400,000, and he could easily pay off his delinquent
debt with it.  This is exactly what he did.
Applicant began working for his current employer in April 2021.  He earns about
$120,000  annually.  (Tr.  p.  73.)  To  resolve  his  indebtedness,  in  November  2021,  he
applied for and obtained a home equity loan in the amount of $65,000, that he used to
In  January  2022,  he  refinanced  his  house  and  pulled
pay  his  delinquent  debts.
$88,000,  that  he  used  to  pay  off  his  remaining  delinquent  debts.  (Tr.  pp.  80-81.)  On
January 17, 2022, Applicant paid off all of the debts set forth in the SOR.

payment of $1,200.  When he became unemployed, he could no longer afford to make
the car payments.  The car was voluntarily repossessed.  The account was settled for
