Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  where  he  has
worked since May 2019. He is a high school graduate. He married in 2018. He has four
stepchildren (Tr. at 14-17; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  problems.  He  had  periods  of  unemployment
and  underemployment.  He  also  admitted  that  he  was  young  and  ignorant  about
finances. He filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in 2011. He listed $7,295 in unsecured
nonpriority claims. His dischargeable debts were discharged in 2012. At his request, his
employer transferred him cross country to another state in 2017. When he arrived, there
was  insufficient  work  for  him,  and  he  was  laid  off  about  eight  months  later.  His  then
fiancée,  now  wife,  moved  with  him,  but  was  unable  to  find  a  job  immediately.  Her
employment  has  been  sporadic  since  the  move.  (Tr.  at  14-15,  19,  22-23,  40-41;

The SOR alleges the 2011 bankruptcy, $3,324 owed in federal income taxes for
tax  year  2017,  and  14  delinquent  debts.  Except  as  addressed  below,  the  debts  are
established through credit reports and Applicant’s admissions.
Applicant filed his federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2017 on time,
but  he  mistakenly  misreported  his  income.  The  IRS  issued  a  refund  of  $1,108  in
February  2018,  but  assessed  additional  taxes  in  2019.  Applicant  made  payments
totaling  $70  in  September  and  October  2019,  and  $50  was  withheld  from  his  2018
refund. The balance, with penalties and interest, in February 2020 was $3,324  (SOR ¶
1.o).  Applicant  entered  into  an  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS  in  March  2020  in
which  he  agreed  to  pay  $50  per  month.  He  made  all  of  the  required  payments.
Additionally,  $1,226  was  withheld  from  his  2019  refund  in  April  2020,  and  $111  was
withheld  from  his  2020  refund  in  June  2021.  He  made  the  last  $50  payment  in  May
2022, and in the same month, he paid  $828 to completely pay the back federal taxes.
(Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2; AE B, D, E, I, J, M)
Applicant’s  state  income  taxes for 2017  were  also  affected.  In  December 2020,
he started a payment agreement with the state to pay $100 per month until the balance
of $1,177 was paid in full. The state confirmed that he paid the back taxes in full in June
2021. The back state taxes were not alleged in the SOR. (AE F, G, I, J)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges $5,039 owed to an apartment landlord. Applicant stated that in
about 2014, he had a week or two left on his lease when the landlord saw him walking
his dog, and she told him it was against the apartment’s policies to have that breed.  He
showed  her  his  lease,  which  did  not  have  a  breed  restriction.  She  threatened  to  evict
him. His lease was up shortly thereafter, so he did not think much of it. He stated that
the  landlord never sent  him  a  letter claiming he  owed  anything,  and  the first  he  heard
about  the debt  was  when  it showed up on his credit  report.  He  disputed  the debt  with
the  credit  reporting  agencies.  It  does  not  appear  on  the  May  2022  credit  report.  It  is
unclear if  he  won  his dispute  or the  account  just  “aged  off” his credit report as beyond
the seven-year reporting window.  (Tr. at 25-27; Applicant’s  response  to  SOR; GE  1-2,
4-7; AE A, J)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  $627  owed  to  a  utility  company  from  2014.  Applicant  stated
that  it  was  the  electricity  account  in  the  apartment  discussed  above.  The  debt  is from
2014.  He  stated that  the  electricity company did  not  shut off  the electricity for about  a
month after he moved out, and he was charged for the electricity for the new tenant. He
stated  that  he  thought  he  paid  it.  It  does  not  appear  on  the  February  2021  and  May
2022  credit  reports,  but  that  provides  little  information  about  whether  it  was  paid
because  the debt  is beyond  the  seven-year reporting window.  Applicant  contacted the
creditor after the hearing. The creditor could not locate any records of the account. (Tr.
at 27-28; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-2, 4-7; AE A, J, L)
Applicant provided inconsistent information about the $1,084 telecommunications
debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. He wrote “Admit” in his response to the SOR, but he testified
that  it  was  not  his  account.  The  debt  is  listed  on  the  2019  and  2020  credit  reports  as
disputed, with December 2013 as when it became delinquent. It does not appear on any
later credit report. It is unclear if Applicant won his dispute or the account just “aged off”
his  credit  report  as  beyond  the  seven-year  reporting  window.  Applicant  contacted  the
creditor after the hearing. The creditor could not locate any records of the account.  (Tr.
at 28-29; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 4-7; AE A, J, L)
The  2019  and  2020  credit reports list a  $1,490  medical  debt (SOR  ¶  1.d) with  the
annotation:  “Consumer  disputes   this account  information.”  The   name   of   the   creditor  is
not identified  in the  credit reports nor the  SOR. The  activity  date  is July  2019. The  debt
does not  appear on  any  later credit report. The  account  did not  age  off  his  credit reports
because   it  was  not  beyond   the   seven-year  reporting   window.   Applicant  believes  this
account was for a medical incident  that happened  on  the  job. He expected  the  employer
to   pay   it  because   it  was  work related.   (Tr. at  29-30; Applicant’s  response   to   SOR;   GE
2,4-7; AE  A, J)
Applicant paid the $1,052 delinquent debt owed to a bank  (SOR ¶ 1.e). He has
another credit card with the bank. He is current on that account. (Tr. at 31; Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2. 4-7; AE A)
Applicant paid the  $620  delinquent debt owed  to  a  collection  company  on  behalf
of  a  bank  (SOR ¶  1.f)  in May  2020. (Tr. at  31-32; Applicant’s response  to  SOR; GE  2, 4-
7; AE  A)
Applicant  testified  that  he  paid  the  $878  delinquent  debt  owed  to  a  collection
company  on  behalf  of  a  bank  (SOR  ¶  1.g).  The  debt  is  listed  on  the  2019  and  2020
credit  reports  with  a  balance  of  $878.  The  account  became  delinquent  in  2019.  The
February 2021 credit report lists the account with a balance of $673 and a date of last
payment  of  January  2021.  The  debt  does  not  appear  on  the  2022  credit  report,  but  it
indicates that he has another credit card with the bank. He is current on that account.
(Tr. at 32; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 4-7; AE A)
Applicant  cosigned  an auto  loan  for  his girlfriend’s (now  wife) car in  2013.  After
paying the loan for more than four years, the car was repossessed in 2018. The credit
reports list the terms of the loan as $242 per month for 60 months, with a high credit of
$16,964.  The  balance  is  reported  as  $13,107.  The  first  delinquency  is  reported  as
March 2018, and the last payment occurred in October 2018. When the amount owed,
the  monthly payments,  and  how long  the  payments  were  made  are  factored  together,
the  balance  appears  high  for  a  deficiency  balance.  Applicant  has  not  made  any
payments since the repossession. (Tr. at 33-34; Applicant’s response  to SOR; GE  1-2,
4-7; AE A)
SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j allege $323 and $3,634 debts owed to the same jewelry store.
Applicant  stated  that  he  paid  the  smaller  debt,  but  not  the  larger  debt.  The  debts  are
listed  on  the  most  recent  credit  reports  as  charged  off  and  transferred,  with  a  $0
balance.  He  stated  that  he  plans  to  pay  the  larger  account.  (Tr.  at  35-36;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1-2, 4-7; AE A, J)
SOR  ¶  1.k  alleges  $242  owed  to  a  collection  company  on  behalf  of  an  Internet
and cable television provider. The debt is listed on the July 2019 combined credit report
as reported by Experian and TransUnion. It is not listed on any later reports. Applicant
thinks  he  may  have  paid  it,  but  he  does  not  remember.  The  company  has  changed
names a few times. Applicant contacted three individuals after the hearing. None of the
three could locate any records of the account. (Tr. at 37; Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 2, 4-7; AE A, L)
Applicant  testified   that   he   paid   the   $135   delinquent  debt  owed   to   a   collection
company  on  behalf  of a  public utility  company  (SOR ¶  1.l) in  the  state  where he  used  to
live. The  debt is listed  on  the  July  2019  combined  credit report as reported  by  all  three
credit reporting  agencies,  with  an  activity  date  of  June  2019. It  is not listed  on  any  later
reports.  Applicant  contacted   the   utility   company   after  the   hearing.  The   company   could
not locate  any  records of  the  account.  (Tr. at 38; Applicant’s response  to  SOR; GE  2, 4-
7;  AE A, L)
Applicant admitted owing the $1,101 and $788 debts owed to a finance company
associated with a retail store (SOR ¶¶ 1.m and 1.n). At the hearing, he testified that he
had  not  made  payment  arrangements,  but  he  planned  to  do  so.  Post-hearing,  he
submitted a document from the successor to the creditor indicating that he reached out
to the creditor in an attempt to resolve the debts.  (Tr. at 35-36; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 2, 4-7; AE A, J, L, N)
Applicant  stated  that  his current  finances  are better.  He  paid  several debts  that
were not alleged in the SOR. He has a good and stable job. His wife is working at a job
where she has a future. They do not live an extravagant lifestyle,  and they are able to
pay their bills. The charged-off auto loan is the only delinquent debt on his most recent
credit report. He realizes that maintaining financial stability is important for his security
clearance,  his  job,  and  his  family.  With  the  exception  of  whatever  he  received  as  a
requirement  of  his bankruptcy,  he  has  not  received  formal financial counseling.  (Tr. at
18-21, 24, 41: GE 2, 4-7; AE A, I)
Applicant  submitted  letters  attesting  to  his  exceptional  job  performance  and
for  his  dependability,  work  ethic,  attitude,
moral  character.  He
is  praised
professionalism, candor, dedication, and trustworthiness. (AE K)
