Applicant, age 43, has five children, including four who share his last name (ages
16, 14, 11, and 7 (born January 2015)) and one with a different last name, age 7 (born
November 2014). He was married twice. He divorced his first wife of six years in 2008
and his second wife of three years in 2017. (Item 3)
Applicant served on active duty as an enlisted member of the U.S. Navy from 1999
until 2010, when he was honorably discharged. His education history was not indicated
in the record. He has been employed as an avionics technician by the defense contractor
sponsoring his SCA since July 2019. He was granted a DOD security clearance in 2003
during his military service, and again in 2014 as employee of another defense contractor.
(Item 3)
The SOR alleged 12 delinquent debts totaling $46,010, including a $26,388 child
support  obligation.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  9  of  the  12  alleged  debts.  His
admitted  debts  totaled  $39,698.  Each  of  the  SOR  allegations  were  confirmed  by
Applicant’s credit reports, dated September 2019, April 2020, and January 2022. (Items
4-6)
Applicant denied the debts alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a ($2,696) and SOR ¶ 1.f ($2,980)
on  the basis that his ex-wife  was  responsible for repaying them. He  disputed  the debt
alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.g  ($636)  on  the  basis  that  he  was  being  wrongfully  charged  for
equipment that he returned and for which he received a receipt. He did not  proffer any
corroborating documents. He asserted that SOR ¶ 1.a related to his “ex-wife’s previous
rental company.” His credit reports listed the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a as a joint account,
and SOR ¶ 1.b as an individual account.  (Items 4, 5)
Applicant  asserted  that  the  medical  collection  accounts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b
($119),  1.c  ($36),  1.d  ($105),  1.i  ($1,077),  and  1.j  ($358)  will  be  paid  by  his  U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability benefits. He explained: “VA  provides me
with  full  coverage  due  to  disabilities.”  He  did not proffer any corroborating documents.
The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.d appeared on all three credit reports in the
record. Those alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j only appeared in the 2019 report. The 2022
report also revealed four new medical debts totaling $613 that went to collections after
the SOR was issued. (Item 4,5)
Although he admitted SOR ¶ 1.e ($26,388), Applicant  claimed  that  he  “received
court ordered  termination”  of  his child support obligation.  Attached to his Answer were
two documents purportedly corroborating his claim, one dated July 14, 2021 (AE B) and
the other dated July 19, 2021 (AE A). AE B relates to his child support obligation for three
of the children who share his last name, ages 14, 11, and 7. Their mother is identified as
Applicant’s  second  ex-wife.  AE  B  is  a  document  terminating  a  previous  income
withholding  order.  AE  A  is  the  related  court  order.  Neither  AE  A  nor  B  establish  that
Applicant’s  child  support  obligation  was  terminated.  They  only  evince  that  an  income
withholding  order  previously  issued  to  his  employer  was  terminated.  Applicant’s  2022
credit report listed two child support accounts in collection status: the one alleged in SOR
¶ 1.e with a reduced balance of $6,189, and another with a balance of $36,226. Because
the  $36,226  account  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  I  will  consider  it  only  in  evaluating
mitigation and the whole person. (AE A, B; Item 6 at 4 and 6)
Applicant plans to pay the debts alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k and 1.l. With respect to the
debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.h,  he  reported  that  the  “vehicle  was  repossessed,”  without
proffering a plan to resolve it. Applicant’s credit reports revealed two new loan accounts
and six new credit-card accounts opened between October 2019 and December 2021,
and  that  he  financed  a  home  purchase  in  June  2022  with  a  VA  loan.  All  of  the  new
accounts were reported to be in good standing. The record did not address the reason
why Applicant failed to disclose any of his derogatory financial information  on his SCA
nor  was  that  omission  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Thus,  I  will  consider  it  only  in  evaluating
mitigation and the whole person. (Item 3 at 43-44; Item 5 at 1, 4; Item 6 at 6-8)
