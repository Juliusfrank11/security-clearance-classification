Applicant admitted  both SOR allegations,  ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, with explanations and
documentation.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  57  years  old.  He  has  a  high  school  diploma.  He  was  married  from
2000-2007, and has a daughter from that marriage, now 19 years old. (GE 1) Applicant
works as a welder for a defense contractor on a U.S. military facility. He has never had
a clearance before but needs one for base access. (Tr. 13, 28-30)
Applicant  worked  for  defense  contractor  1  from  1984  until  January  2013,  when
he  was  laid  off.  Until  about  March  2015,  he  worked  on  his  farm  but  was  otherwise
unemployed. He then worked as a welder for defense contractor 2, from March 2015 to
February 2016. Applicant left that job because of the hours. He worked on his farm for
the  next  year,  until  February 2017,  but  was  again  otherwise  unemployed.  In  February
2017, Applicant returned to work with his long-time employer, defense contractor 1 and
has continued working there. (Tr. 32-35, 57-59; GE 1)
The SOR concerns two years of state and federal unfiled income tax returns, for
tax years 2015 and 2018. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b) Applicant disclosed on his 2017 SCA that
he had not filed his 2015 income tax returns. He indicated, both in his Answer and his
testimony, that this was because he was unemployed at the time and was injured with
no  health  insurance.  (Tr.  30-31,  35;  Answer)  Applicant  clarified  in  his  testimony  that  it
was  during  tax  year  2016  that  he  was  largely  unemployed,  not  2015.  (Tr.  53-54)  In
2016, his income was $461. (Tr. 50-51; GE 2 at 20)
Applicant also acknowledged that during this period, he withdrew money from his
IRA retirement account in order to support himself. He did not realize that doing so had
tax implications.  He  said  he  thought  his state  and federal tax returns  had  been  “taken
care of” during the IRA withdrawal process. (Tr. 36-40; GE 8, GE 9)
For tax year 2015, tax records in the Government’s evidence show an extension
filed  by  his  tax  preparer  but  no  return  filed  subsequently.  (Tr.  49;  GE  2  at  19,  36)
Applicant  filed  his  2015  state  and  federal  returns  in  December  2017,  through  his  tax
preparer. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b) He received a $33 federal refund. His 2015 state return did
not reflect either a refund or money owed. (AE J)
Applicant  also  did  not  timely  file  his  state  and  federal  tax  returns  for  tax  year
2018.  (SOR  ¶¶ 1.a,  1.b)  This is documented by a  December 2019 letter from  the  IRS
that  Applicant  provided  with  an  interrogatory  response.  (GE  2  at  37)  A  2018  account
transcript shows that an extension was filed in April 2019, but no return was filed. (GE 2
at  22;  37)  Applicant  indicated  that  he  had  mailed  the  returns  on  December  19,  2019,
and that he owed $416. (GE 2 at 11)
AE C contains a signed handwritten note from Applicant’s tax preparer explaining
that  “the  tax  return  did  not  get  transmitted  when  it  was  prepared  in  2018.”  (AE  C)  (In
fact, this refers to “the 2018 tax year” not “in 2018.”) (Tr. 59-60, 64) Applicant’s 2018 tax
returns were filed in May 2020, with the assistance of his tax preparer. (AE A, AE B) He
paid $416 in federal taxes (as noted previously) and received a $231 state refund. (AE
B, AE D)
Applicant has retained the same tax preparation firm for almost 40 years. (AE B
through  AE  K;  Tr.  73)  This  relationship  predates  the  tax  years  at  issue,  and  is  also
ongoing.  Applicant acknowledged  that  he  did  not  understand the process, and that he
should have  sought the  advice  of  his tax preparer in  considering what to do about his
2015 income tax returns. (Tr. 38) As to the late filings, Applicant acknowledged that he
was at fault and offered no excuse for his tardiness other than being busy and “terrible
with  documents.”  (Tr.  41-43,  78)  He  said  that  typically,  “I  would  pile  my  stuff  up  and
carry it to the tax man.” (Tr. 46)
Applicant  did  not  provide   copies  of   his  2015   state   and   federal  returns  at  his
hearing, but did  so  afterwards,  along  with  returns from  2014  and  2016. (AE  I,  AE  J,  AE
K)  The   printed   copies   of   all   of   Applicant’s  state   returns  from   2014-2016   show   a   “filing
date”  of May  24,   2022. (AE   I,   AE  J, AE   K) Thus,   it would   appear that   all  of the  returns
were  filed  shortly  after  the  hearing.  However,  on  May  31,  2022,  Department  Counsel
provided the following information in an e-mail to Applicant and myself:
I  got  in  touch   with   Mr. [name   redacted],  the  accountant.   He affirmed   that
the  [state]   returns   were filed   concurrently   with   their   Federal counterparts.
The   current   date   is  added   whenever  the   software  he   uses  reprints  a
return.” (HE III)
On that basis, the timing of the timing of the filing of these state returns is accepted as
concurrent with the federal returns for 2014-2016, as noted.
Applicant documented that his tax returns have always been prepared and filed
by  his  longtime  tax  preparer.  Applicant  filed  his  2014  state  and  federal  tax  return  in
January 2016. He received an $884 federal refund and a $508 state refund. (AE I)  He
filed  his 2016  state and federal tax returns  in  May 2018.  (While not  alleged,  these tax
returns were also late, though likely due to Applicant’s medical issues and employment
instability  at  the  time).  For  2016,  he  reported  income  of  $461,  and  received  small
refunds. (Tr. 50-51; GE 2 at 20; AE K) For tax year 2017, his returns were filed in July
2018,  and  he  received  a  refund  of  $2,711.  (GE  2  at  21;  Tr.  51)  He  received  small
refunds for his state and federal taxes for tax years 2019 (AE F), and 2020 (AE G), and
he filed an extension for 2021 (AE H)
Credit reports from 2017 and 2018 show a few medical debts, but no other debts,
and  more  recent  credit  reports,  from  September  2019  and  April  2022,  show  no
delinquencies. (GE 4 – GE 7) The SOR alleges no debts.
Applicant  reported  on  a  current  personal  financial  statement  that  he  earns
$59,000  annually  in  his  job.  He  reported  an  extra  $10,000  in  estimated  income  from
side jobs and cattle sales from his farm. After monthly expenses and repayment on his
mortgage and another loan, he reported a monthly surplus of about $1,637. (AE E)
