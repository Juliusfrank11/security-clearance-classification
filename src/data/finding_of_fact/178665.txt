Financial Considerations
Applicant was underemployed in 2013 and 2014 after moving away from the West
Coast to assist her father. (Tr. 23-24) She and her son moved in with her father and then
into a trailer park. (Tr. 25-26) Several of the SOR debts became delinquent in the 2013
to 2014 time period. (Tr. 25) After living in the area with her father for about 15 months,
Applicant  returned  to  the  West  Coast  and  obtained  better  employment.  (Tr.  26)  Her
current monthly net income is $4,200. (Tr. 45) She has a monthly remainder of roughly
about $1,000 left after paying her expenses and debts. (Tr. 47) She agreed to provide a
personal financial statement and five years of IRS Form 1040s to enable me to assess
her income and available remainder after her hearing. (Tr. 51-52) After her hearing she
provided three character letters, a personal statement, and an email from a creditor. (AE
A-AE  E)  Applicant  wrote  that  after  her  hearing  she  contacted  or  attempted  to  contact

The SOR alleges 23 delinquent debts totaling $53,420 as follows: 1.a is a charged-
off credit union debt for $3,268; 1.b, 1.u, and 1.v are Department of Education  (D. Ed.)
student loans placed for collection for $3,192, $1,864, and $4,482; 1.c  is a debt placed
for collection for $2,788; 1.d, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.p are Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
debts placed for collection for $1,862, $474,  $151,  and $250;  1.e, 1.f,  1.s,  and  1.t  are

and 1.r are accounts placed for collection for $6,704 and $818; and 1.w is a charged-off
debt resulting from a vehicle repossession for $17,892. (HE 2; GE 3)
On May 15, 2020, Applicant said she called the creditor for the charged-off credit
union debt in SOR 1.a for $3,268; however, all she received was a recording. (HE 3) She
was unable to reach the creditor to arrange a resolution. (Id.) At her hearing, she said she
contacted the creditor to set up a payment plan, and the creditor did not have a record of
the debt. (Tr. 38-39) She suggested the debt was dropped from her credit report. (Tr. 38)
Applicant’s June 15, 2022 credit report does not show this debt. (GE 5)
Applicant’s D. Ed. student loans in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.u, and 1.v for $3,192, $1,864,
and  $4,482  were  placed  for  collection.  On  May  22,  2019,  Applicant  told  an  Office  of
Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that she was making $75 monthly payments
to address the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.u and 1.v. (GE 4 at 2) On May 15, 2020, she said her
student loan total was $4,574, and she said she submitted a financial hardship request to
the creditor. (HE 3) She said if the financial hardship request was denied, she intended
to submit a request for a payment plan. (Id.)
At  her  hearing,  Applicant  said  she  asked  D.  Ed.  to  set  up  a  consolidation  and
waiver  for  her  student-loan  debts.  (Tr.  31-32)  She  believed  her  student  loans  totaled
$4,482;  however,  she  had  not  heard  from  D.  Ed.  (Tr.  32-33)  She  disputed  her
responsibility for the student-loan debt because she believed she was the victim of identity
theft when she was living with her father in 2013 to 2014. (Tr. 33-34) She did not apply
for the student loans, and she believed the college applied for them without her consent.
(Tr.  33)  However,  her  June  15,  2022  credit  report  reflects  the  student  loans  were
borrowed  in  2011,  which  was  before  she  moved  to  assist  her  father.  Two  delinquent
student loans are listed for $1,289 and $3,277. (GE 5 at 5) The high credit for the $1,289
debt was $1,750, which is an indication of  some payments, and the high credit for the
$3,277 debt is $3,000. (Id.) The date for the most recent payment on either of the two
debts  is  February 2019.  (Id.) At her hearing,  she  said  she  submitted  the  request for a
repayment  plan  about  three  months  before  her  hearing.  (Tr.  34)  She  said  she  would
provide her request for a payment plan after her hearing (Tr. 34); however, she did not
provide it.
SOR ¶¶ 1.c for $2,788 and 1.l for $208 are being collected by the same collection
agent. On May 15, 2020, Applicant said she would contact the creditor in the next 30 days
to make arrangements to pay the remaining balance. (HE 3) At her hearing,  Applicant
said the debt for $208 was paid in full, and she provided a confirmation number. (Tr. 37;
SOR response, Encl. 2) She could not remember whether she ever addressed the debt
for $2,788. (Tr. 38) Applicant’s June 15, 2022 credit report does not show a debt owed to
this collection agent. (GE 5)
Applicant  had  four  delinquent  debts  owed  to  the  VA  in  connection  with  her
education expenses. (Tr. 37) On April 23, 2020, Applicant paid the VA debts placed for
collection in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.p for $1,862, $474, $151, and $250. (Tr. 35-36;
SOR response, Encl. 3) Applicant’s June 15, 2022 credit report does not show any debts
owed to the VA. (GE 5)
On May 15, 2020, Applicant said she was seeking financial assistance to resolve
the  four  delinquent  medical  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.e,  1.f,  1.s,  and  1.t  for  $1,789,
$1,332, $1,588, and $1,182. (HE 3) She said if she did not receive financial assistance,
she would pay $150 monthly until the debt is paid in full. (Id.) At her hearing, she said
the  four debts  were  paid.  (Tr.  30-31)  Applicant’s  June  15,  2022  credit  report  does  not
show any medical debts. (GE 5)
For the SOR debts in ¶¶ 1.g through 1.k for $1,002, $733, $484, $437, and $212,
Applicant mistakenly kept the equipment for television services when she moved. On May
15, 2020, she said she planned to start payment plans for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 1.i,
and 1.j, and she planned to dispute the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k because she did not receive
services from the company. (HE 3) At her hearing, she said she paid the debts in SOR
¶¶ 1.h and 1.j for $733 and $437. (Tr. 41-42) Of the five debts, the only debt shown in her
June 15, 2022 credit report is her charged-off debt in SOR ¶ 1.j for $437. (GE 5 at 4)
Applicant disputed the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.m for $1,018 and 1.r for $818 allegedly
owed  to  telecommunications  companies.  (Tr.  41-42)  On  May  15,  2020,  she  said  she
planned to inquire about and possibly dispute the debt in SOR ¶ 1.m, and she said the
debt on SOR ¶ 1.r did not appear on her current credit report. (HE 3) Her June 15, 2022
credit report does not show any debts owed to  either of the creditors or their collection
agents. (GE 5)
Applicant’s  collection  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.q  for  $6,704  related  to  damages  to  an
apartment she rented. (Tr. 39-40) On May 22, 2019, she told an OPM investigator that
she was unaware the debt had gone to collections, and she would follow up on the debt.
(GE 4 at 2) On May 15, 2020, she said the debt was paid in full in 2017 and is no longer
showing on her credit report. (HE 3) At her hearing, she said in 2019, she paid the debt
through her monthly paycheck. (Tr. 39, 41) Her June 21, 2018 credit report reflects this
debt in the collections section with an assignment date of March 2017 and an activity date
of June 2018. (GE 3 at 7) Her November 19, 2019 and June 15, 2022 credit reports do
not  show  this  debt.  (GE  2;  GE  5)  After  her  hearing  she  emailed  the  creditor  and  was
advised by email that her email was blocked. (AE E)
Applicant’s delinquent debt in SOR ¶ 1.w for $17,892 related to the repossession
of her truck in 2014. Her June 21, 2018 credit report reflects a  charged-off account for
this debt. (GE 3 at 9) On May 22, 2019, Applicant told an OPM investigator that when the
vehicle was repossessed she thought the sale of the vehicle covered the balance. (GE 4
at 2) She promised to “follow up” on this account. (Id.) On May 15, 2020, Applicant said
the debt is no longer on her credit report. (HE 3) At her hearing, she said she set up an
automatic payment plan through her employer and had made 36 monthly payments of
$230.  (Tr.  29)  Applicant  said  she  would  contact  the  creditor  to  obtain  proof  of  her
payments.  (Tr.  30)  Her  June  15,  2022  credit  report  does  not  show  this  debt.  (GE  5)
Department  Counsel  suggested  she  could  also  provide  her  pay  stubs  to  show  her
payments. (GE 5)
Character Evidence
Applicant provided three character statements from coworkers. (AE B-AE D) They
indicate she is trustworthy, diligent, and professional. She made important contributions
to  her  company.  Their  letters  support  granting  her  continued  access  to  classified
information.
