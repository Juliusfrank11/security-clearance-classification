In  her  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  (¶¶  1.a-1.m).  Her
admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. Based on my review of the pleadings,
evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is 38  years old. She  has a six-year-old son. She cohabitated with her
boyfriend,  who  is  her son’s father, until 2021.  She  now lives  with  family  to  reduce  her
monthly  expenses.  She  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2006.  She  has  worked  as  a
financial analyst for a defense contractor since 2009. (Tr. 17– 20, 38; GE 1)
In  her  testimony,  Applicant  attributed  her  financial  problems  to  the  early-2016
period. In March 2016, Applicant gave birth  to her son eight weeks early. She  was on
maternity leave for 12 weeks after his birth, and was paid 60 percent of her salary during
that time. The baby’s premature birth also created hospital bills for her. Applicant stated
that SOR ¶¶ 1.i-1m are the medical debts related to his birth that insurance did not cover.
(Tr. 20-21, 28-30)
Applicant purchased her home in 2014, and it was foreclosed upon in early 2017.
At that time, her boyfriend had agreed to split their household expenses each month. She
claimed  that  he  was  unable  to  do  so  during  that  two-year  period  because  he  was  in-
between jobs. The record shows that he was unemployed twice in 2014, for about four
months  the  first  time,  and  for  about  a  month  the  second  time.  He  was  consistently
employed after 2014. She tried to sell the home before foreclosure; however, they had a
flood in the basement, which prevented a sale. (Tr. 42-44, 50-58; AE H, I)
In May 2021, there was a fire in Applicant’s apartment building. Her rental unit and
belongings suffered water damage from this incident. She was displaced for most of the
month. Her losses were covered by insurance, and her out-of-pocket expenses were less
than  $1,000.  Before  renting  another  unit,  she  decided  to  move-in  with  her  mother  to
reduce her expenses. Since her move, her boyfriend was supposed to provide her with
funds for child support, but he has not done so, and she has not taken any action to obtain
it. (Tr. 33-39, 50-58; AE H)
In February 2022, Applicant required treatment and examination at the hospital.
She  stated  that  her  bills  from  that  event  were  about  $1,042.  She  asserted  that  she  is
paying those bills first, before addressing her other delinquent debts. (Tr. 40; AE D)
In  August  2018,  Applicant  was  asked  about  twelve  of  the  SOR  debts  by  a
government investigator. She stated that she was going to request validation of six, and
asserted that she would contact the creditors to make payment arrangements if the debts
were hers. She admitted responsibility for the other six debts, and stated that she planned
to contact the creditors to make payment arrangements. Only one of these twelve debts
has been resolved in the last four years. (GE 3)
Applicant submitted a monthly budget. Her greatest monthly expense is for her car,
which altogether costs her $915 each month. She also spends about $1,300 monthly on
payments for her credit cards, a personal loan, and a student loan. She is  also paying
$200  monthly for her  recent medical  bills,  and  $150  towards  the  judgement  alleged  in
SOR ¶ 1.a. She has about $500 left over at the end of the month. About $100 of that goes
into her savings, and the rest is spent on incidentals. She has no other funds leftover at
the end of the month for other debt payments. She stated that after her recent hospital
bills are paid, she plans to pay her other medical debts, and later her delinquent consumer
debts. (Tr. 48; AE D, E, K, L)
The SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts, totaling about $51,000. The status of the
debts are as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a  is a judgement entered against Applicant in December 2019 for $4,444.
The  creditor  is  a  collection  agency  collecting  a  delinquent  consumer  debt.  A  writ  of
garnishment was issued in 2020, but the records show she is making monthly payments
of $150. The balance as of May 2022 was down to $1,767. (Tr. 21-22, 30-31; GE 7; AE
B; M, N).
SOR ¶ 1.b  is a credit card account that was charged-off for $21,894. Applicant has
not taken action on this debt. (Tr. 21-22, 31; GE 4, 6)
SOR ¶ 1.c is an unsecured debt that was charged-off for $7,371. Applicant has not
taken action on this debt. (Tr. 23, 31; GE 4, 6)
SOR ¶ 1.d  is a credit card account that was charged-off for $6,201. The last activity
on this account was in 2014. Although Applicant claimed that this debt was being paid,
she did not provide documentation showing that she has taken any action on this account.
(Tr. 22-24, 32, 45; GE 4)
SOR ¶ 1.e  is a consumer debt that was charged-off for $1,352. Although Applicant
claimed that this debt was being paid, she did not provide documentation showing that
she has taken any action on this account. (Tr. 23-24, 32; GE 4, 6)
SOR ¶ 1.f  is a credit card account that was placed for collection for $3,012. The
last activity on this account was in 2015. Applicant paid a settlement on this account in
2019. It is now resolved. (Tr. 23-24, 32, 44-47; GE 5; AE P)
SOR ¶ 1.g  is a credit card account placed for collection for $1,200. The last activity
on the account was in 2016. Applicant paid a settlement on this account in 2019. It is now
resolved. (Tr. 23-24, 32, 44-47; GE 5; AE O)
SOR  ¶  1.h  is  a  credit  card  account  that  was  placed  for  collection  for  $4,408.
Although  Applicant  claimed  that  this  debt  was  being  paid,  she  did  not  provide
documentation showing that she has taken any action on this account. (Tr. 23, 32; GE 6)
SOR  ¶¶   1.i   -  1.m   are  medical  debts  placed  for  collection  in  the  total  amount  of
$1,338. Applicant attributed these debts to the birth of her son in 2016. Applicant stated
that she will pay these after she completes repayment of her recent medical debt from
2022. (Tr. 23, 29-30; GE 6)
