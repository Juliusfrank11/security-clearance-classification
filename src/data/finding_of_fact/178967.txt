In her Answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.d, and 1.g, and denied ¶¶ 1.e
and 1.f. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact.  Based on my review
of  the  pleadings,  evidence  submitted,  and  testimony,  I  make  the  following  findings  of
fact:
Applicant  is  34  years  old.  She  was  married  in  2010  and  divorced  in  2013.  She
remarried in 2021, and has two young children with her second husband. She has been
employed as an airplane mechanic by a defense contractor since 2019. She served on
active  duty  in  the  Navy  from  2010-2015.  She  was  deployed  three  times  during  this
period. She served in the Navy Reserves from 2015-2022, and received an  honorable
discharge.  She  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  about  2011.  She  earned  an
associate’s  degree in 2017, and several trade school certificates in 2020. (Tr. 17 –  26;
GE 1)
Applicant stated that her financial problems started in her early 20s after joining
the Navy. She was immature, and made some poor financial decisions because of her
youth and inexperience. In 2013, she separated from her first husband. While she was
on  deployment,  he  ran  up  charges  on  her  credit  card,  stole  almost  all  of  her
possessions out of her apartment, and emptied her bank account. He also absconded
with  a  vehicle  that  they  jointly  owned.  When  they  divorced  later  that  year,  he  was  in
prison. (Tr. 34-43, 97)
In 2015, after Applicant left active duty service with the Navy, she was unable to
find  gainful  employment.  She  had  several  jobs  at  a  time  earning  minimum  wage,  and
was  living  paycheck  to  paycheck.  She  stated  that  she  was  barely  able  to  afford  her
monthly  expenses,  and  was  unable  to  resolve  outstanding  debts  until  she  obtained
better  employment. She finally obtained employment  in her career field as an airplane
mechanic in 2019. She is now earning about $71,000 annually. (Tr. 34-43, 87-91)
In  2020,  when  her  finances  stabilized,  Applicant  started  researching  how  to
repair her credit and resolve her debts. She stated that she did her best not to incur new
unnecessary debt. Through  a finance-related podcast,  she found  a credit  repair group
that provided financial counseling and  other specific guidance to members for minimal
cost. She used the information that she learned to start making settlement offers to her
creditors,  and  requested  debt  validations  for  accounts  that  she  believed  were
fraudulent. She has been using this method to address the debts listed on the SOR. (Tr.
26-28, 32-33, 82-84, 94)
In  2017,  Applicant  became  seriously  ill  while  pregnant.  This  created  loss  of
wages  and  financial  hardships.  When  she  became  pregnant  again  in  2021,  she  took
proactive financial measures, anticipating that she would be unable to work for a period
of time. She prepaid some of the family’s monthly bills six months ahead, to include car
payments,  so  she  and  her  husband  would  not  be  at  risk  for  default  or  repossession.
This expense  took away from  her ability to resolve some delinquent debt. (Tr. 40-46, 49-
59)
Applicant   submitted   a   monthly   budget.   It   shows  that  she   and   her   husband   are
able  to   meet  their   monthly   expenses,   and   pay   debts.   Their   biggest  monthly   expenses
are  for  child   care  and   their   vehicle   payments.  While   costly,  she   was  able  to   credibly
explain  why  her family needed  the  used  SUV  she  purchased  in 2021. In  2022, she  has
already  paid  about  $1,200  of medical debt from  her  2021  pregnancy  and  delivery;  about
$3,000  of  her husband’s debt;  and  settled  two  of  the  SOR debts. (Tr. 42-43,  71-82, 87-
91, 96; AE A-H)
The  SOR  alleges  six  delinquent  debts,  totaling  about  $30,000,  as  well  as  a
suspension of  Applicant’s  security clearance in  2011, for financial reasons. The status
of the debts are as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a  is a credit card that has been charged-off for $8,207. Applicant stated
that she incurred this debt in 2015 when the transmission went out in her vehicle. While
the  repair  was  costly,  it  was  less  expensive  than  acquiring  a  new  vehicle.  Since  her
savings  were  limited,  she  charged  the  repair  cost  to  her  credit  card.  After  leaving  the
Navy,  she  stated  that  she  was  struggling  to  earn  enough  money  to  cover  her  basic
expenses,  so  she  stopped  paying  her  credit  card.  She  contacted  the  creditor  to  settle
this debt. She provided documentation showing that she paid the negotiated settlement
offer. The debt it is now resolved. (Tr. 34-41; AE F, G)
SOR ¶ 1.b  is student-loan debt placed for collection for $19,187. Applicant stated
that  she  did  not  defer  her  student  loan  repayments  while  she  was  in  school  or
afterwards, because neither the lender or her school’s financial aid department advised
her  that  was  possible.  When  she  contacted  the  lender,  she  was  offered  an  income-
based  repayment  plan  that  she  could  not  afford  at  the  time.  Once  her  finances
stabilized,  she  contacted  the  lender  to  rehabilitate  the  loan.  In  2021  she  made  some
$109  monthly  payments,  and  her  current  monthly  payments  are  $220.  Her  intent  is  to
consolidate the debts into one loan. She has also applied for loan forgiveness for part of
the balance, and has a plan to resolve this debt in the near future. (Tr. 29-30; 53-63; AE
A)
SOR  ¶  1.c   is  a  credit  card  that  was  placed  for  collection  for  $1,228.  Applicant
stated that this account was likely the result of fraud, and she has contested this debt.
She  currently  has  another  credit  card  account  with  this  creditor  in  good  standing.  She
asked  for  debt  validation  for  this  account,  and  the  creditor  provided  invalid  personal
information. She also claims that she made a settlement offer several months ago to get
it  off  her  credit  report,  and  never  received  a  reply.  She  has  not  received  further
correspondence form the creditor. (Tr. 30-31, 63-67; GE 6)
SOR ¶ 1.d  is a debt in collection for $675. It was a store credit card that her ex-
boyfriend  used  to  purchase  clothes  for  himself.  Applicant  contacted  the  creditor  and
sent them a settlement offer. This debt is now resolved. (Tr. 31, 67-69; AE C)
SOR  ¶  1.e   is  a  debt  in  collection  for  $245.  Applicant  stated  this  was  a  bill  for
cable and internet services. She has resolved this debt. (Tr. 31, 69-70; AE B)
SOR  ¶  1.f   is  a  credit  card  debt  that  was  charged-off  for  $451.  Applicant  has
resolved this debt. (Tr. 31, 69-70; AE D, H)
SOR  ¶  1.g  alleged  that  Applicant  had  her  security  clearance  suspended  for
financial  reasons  in  2011.  While  this  is  accurate,  she  appealed  the  Navy  Central
Adjudication  Facility’s  (CAF)  decision,  and  her  clearance  was  reinstated.  Applicant
stated  that  she  worked  with  a  Navy  attorney  to  resolve  the  case.  They  submitted
documentation  showing  that  she  contested  the  majority  of  accounts  on  the  SOR,
because they were fraudulent, and these creditors were unable to validate these debts.
She  admitted  responsibility  for  some  of  the  debts,  and  took  action  to  resolve  them  at
that  time.  She  was  told  by  the  Navy  CAF  in  October  2011  to  continue  to  meet  her
financial  obligations.  The  debts  from  2011  were  not  connected  to  her  later  financial
problems. (Tr. 34-43, 97; GE 3)
