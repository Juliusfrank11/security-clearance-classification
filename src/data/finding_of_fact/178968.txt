The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of August 26, 2021, Applicant owed
charged-off  debts  of  $30,922  (SOR  ¶  1.a);  $9,995  (SOR  ¶  1.b);  $3,075  (SOR  ¶  1.c);
$12,011 (SOR ¶ 1.d); and $31,487 (SOR ¶ 1.e); and that Applicant received a Chapter 7
bankruptcy discharge in June 2021 (SOR ¶ 1.f). Under Guideline H, Applicant is alleged to
have used marijuana three times between June 2016 and September 2016 while he held
access  eligibility  for  classified  information  (SOR  ¶  2.a).  When  Applicant  answered  the
SOR,  he  admitted  that  he  had  owed  the  five  alleged  debts,  which  became  delinquent
because of his divorce and the failure of tenants, and that he had received a discharge of
those debts in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy before the SOR was issued.
After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the following
findings of fact:
Applicant is 37 years old and divorced. He served in the enlisted ranks of a branch
of the United States military from June 2003 until April 2014. He achieved E-6 rank and
was granted an honorable discharge. He took some classes at a community college from
January 2012 to December 2013. He has worked as a nuclear test engineer for his current
employer, a defense contractor, since his discharge from the military in April 2014. He held
a DOD security clearance at the level of secret from 2003 until it was suspended upon the
issuance of the SOR. (GE 1; Tr. 24-25.) His security clearance eligibility was last renewed
in 2014 for his defense-contractor employment. (Tr. 45.)
Applicant purchased a home in October 2010. He obtained a mortgage loan for
$215,526 with initial repayment at $1,435 per month. (GE 2; AE E.) Available credit reports
show that he obtained a car loan in August 2010 for $34,613, which he paid off one year
later in a $30,737 lump sum. In May 2011, he obtained a car loan for $29,090 that he paid
off in April 2013 in a $22,089 lump sum. (GE 3.)
On  his marriage  in  October 2015,  Applicant  moved  in  with  his ex-wife,  who co-
owned  her  home  with  her  ex-husband.  (Tr.  41.)  Applicant  kept  his  house  as  a  rental
property. His ex-wife’s income as a registered nurse was comparable to his income. (Tr.
27.) However, she had poor credit so the debts incurred during their marriage were  in
Applicant’s name. (Tr. 42.) He made his debt payments on time. (AEs D-E.)
Around January 2018, Applicant decided to divorce his  ex-wife for her infidelity.
(GEs 1, 5; Tr. 25.) He consulted with an attorney about a bankruptcy, and was advised to
wait until his divorce was final. He had some sizeable debts but was making payments on
them. He was informed that if he was committed to filing for bankruptcy, he would not
benefit from making payments on his unsecured debts. (Tr. 48.) He and his attorney had
discussed a possible Chapter 13, but Applicant preferred a Chapter 7 filing because he
“would be out of it in a matter of months rather than a period of three to five years.” He
wanted to stabilize his life after his divorce sooner rather than later. (Tr. 50.) On the advice
of the bankruptcy attorney, Applicant stopped paying on his unsecured debts, including a
loan  in  his  name  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  for  the  car  his  ex-wife  was  driving.  (Tr.  27,  36,  40.) He
continued to make the payments on the mortgage for his property, in which he had tenants,
and on his loan for a 2007 model-year car that he was driving. He had obtained the loan in
October 2016 for $14,876. (GE 2.)
Applicant’s house was rented out, so on his marital separation in February 2018,
Applicant moved into a one-bedroom apartment at rent of approximately $900 a month.
(GE 1; Tr. 28, 49.) In March 2018, his tenants stopped paying the rent. He asserts that
“there was zero chance that [he] would have been able to maintain those payments” on his
unsecured debts at that point. (Tr. 37.) He lost about $7,000 in rental income between
March 2018 and August 2018 (GE 5), and fell behind in his mortgage payments over that
time. (GE 2; AEs C-D.) He paid his ex-wife $600 a month during the divorce proceedings
from March 2018 to December 2018. (Tr. 49-50.) In August 2018, he succeeded in having
his  tenants  evicted.  (GE  1;  AE  F;  Tr.  28,  37-38.)  Of  the  $1,064  in  legal  fees  and
disbursements for the eviction proceeding, he had paid all but $89 as of August 21, 2018.
(AE F.) By then, the accounts in the SOR had been charged off. (GE 2; AE D.) Applicant
made no efforts to try and settle any of the past-due debts. (Tr. 45.)
Applicant and his ex-wife’s divorce was final in December 2018. (GE 1; AE B.) They
share custody of their daughter now age 5, and split the time spent with their daughter. (AE
B, Tr. 30.) Applicant has paid $100 a week in child support since his divorce. (GE 5; Tr.
36.) He has never been behind in his child support payments. (Tr. 48.)
To  renew  his  security  clearance  eligibility,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  as
accurate a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on January 16, 2020. He
disclosed that he had used marijuana recreationally with his then wife on two or three
occasions between June 2016 and September 2016 while he held a security clearance. He
denied any intention to use marijuana in the future, as he did not enjoy it and has since
been divorced from his ex-wife whose drug use was a contributing factor. (GE 1.)
In response to SF 86 inquiries about any financial delinquency involving routine
accounts, Applicant listed seven delinquent accounts: a $28,101 deficiency balance on a
loan for a repossessed vehicle  that his ex-wife retained after the divorce  (SOR ¶ 1.a);
$3,060 on an unsecured loan obtained for home improvements (driveway repaving, Tr. 41)
in  collection  (SOR  ¶  1.c);  three  credit-card  debts  in  collection  for $9,996  (SOR ¶ 1.b),
$12,017 (SOR ¶ 1.d), and $2,515 (not alleged in SOR); a $31,487 balance on a debt-
consolidation loan in collection (SOR ¶1.e); and a $1,291 hospital bill in collection (not
alleged). Applicant explained that he was unable to afford the payments on the accounts
after his marital separation as he had to establish a new household and provide  for his
daughter. He expressed a plan to file for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy with his tax refund for
2019 and that he had been told by his lawyer to concentrate on remaining current on his
mortgage loan and his car loan. (GE 1.)
As of May 12, 2020, Applicant’s credit report showed that he was on time with his
monthly payments of $1,460 and $341 on his mortgage and car loans. He had not been
late on his mortgage since September 2018, and had never missed a car payment. As of
April 2020, the balances were $175,204 (mortgage) and $2,032 (car loan). He reportedly
owed  the  following  charged-off  balances:  $30,922  (SOR  ¶  1.a,  opened  for $59,071  in
October 2016, charged off for $18,646 in July 2018); $9,995 (SOR ¶ 1.b, charged off in
July  2018);  $3,075  (SOR  ¶  1.c,  charged  off  in  July  2018);  and  $12,011  (SOR  ¶  1.d,
charged off for $12,016 in August 2018). His credit report reflected that a past-due balance
of $31,487 (SOR ¶ 1.e) was charged off in June 2018. (GE 2.) Information gleaned from a
May 2022 credit report indicates that he obtained the loan for $40,000 in June 2016, so he
had paid down the loan until February 2018. (AEs C, E.)
On May 19, 2020, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He explained that he divorced his ex-wife for her
infidelity, and that he had no obligations in the divorce to his ex-wife apart from his child
support. He retained those assets that he had brought into the marriage, including his
house. He denied any use of marijuana beyond his brief experimentation with his ex-wife in
the summer of 2016. He held a DOD secret clearance at the time of his drug use and
admitted knowing that he was not authorized to use marijuana and should have reported it.
Applicant acknowledged owing the delinquencies in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.e as well as the $1,291
medical debt listed on his SF 86. He explained about the car loan for his ex-wife’s vehicle
(SOR ¶ 1.a) that it was in his name; that she made no effort to pay on the loan during their
separation;  and  that  the  vehicle  was  repossessed  and  sold.  (GE  5.)  The  vehicle  was
repossessed in May 2018. (Tr. 39.)
Applicant explained to the OPM investigator that the credit-card accounts in SOR ¶¶
1.b-1.d were for household expenses and to repave his driveway. The debt-consolidation
loan  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  was  used  to  pay  off  some  credit-card  debts  and  for  household
expenses. He attributed his financial issues to his divorce because he had to establish a
new residence  for himself  on  their separation  and  also  a  tenant  did  not  pay rent  from
March 2018 to August 2018. He lost about $7,000 in income and had to evict the tenant in
2018.  After  consulting  with  a  bankruptcy  attorney,  he  decided  to  keep  current  on  his
mortgage and car loans needed to live, and he stopped paying on unnecessary accounts
that  he  could  not  afford  to  repay.  Applicant  expressed  that  he  planned  to  resolve  his
delinquent debts by filing for bankruptcy in the future when he had the  money to pay a
bankruptcy attorney. (GE 5.)
Applicant  retained  his  bankruptcy  attorney  on  August  26,  2020,  at  a  flat  fee  of
$2,500. (GE 4; Tr. 29.) He asserts that he could not previously afford to retain a bankruptcy
attorney  because  he  had  other  legal  fees  stemming  from  his  divorce  and  the  eviction
proceedings. (Tr. 29.)
As  of  November  3,  2020,  Applicant  was  still  current  on  his  mortgage  loan.  In
October 2020, he paid off the loan for his vehicle, a 2007 model-year car that he retained
following his divorce. (AE E.) He still has that car (Tr. 39), as well as a 2017 model-year
truck that he bought in October 2020 with a loan for $34,285, to be repaid at $633 per
month for 72 months. (GEs 3-4.) That truck loan does not appear on his June 2022 credit
reports (AEs D-E), but he listed the truck loan as a secured debt on his bankruptcy petition.
(GE 4.) The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d were on his credit report as past-due balances with
no progress toward repayment. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.e was not on his credit report. (GE 3.)
After  completing   a   debtor-education   course  required   for  a   bankruptcy   filing,
Applicant filed  a  no-asset Chapter 7  bankruptcy  petition  on  March 8, 2021. (Tr. 30-31.)  He
listed  $93,661  in unsecured, nonpriority  claims on  nine  accounts:  the  five  accounts in the
SOR; three  medical debts of  $328, $1,291, and  $2,046;  and  a  $2,542  credit-card  debt.  (GE
4.) That credit card does not appear on  the  credit reports in evidence, so  it is unclear when
he   opened   that  account  or  whether  it  was  delinquent  as   of   his  bankruptcy   filing.  He
exempted  his two  secured  claims (the  truck and  mortgage  loans) from  his bankruptcy  and
indicated  that he  intended  to  retain the  properties and  continue  to  make  his payments.  He
reported  wage  income  of  $86,631  in 2019  and  $100,353  in 2020, but also that his monthly
expenses exceeded  his income  by  about $10. He listed  a checking-account balance  of
$222; one  cent in savings; $2,497  in an  investment account;  and  $13,498  in a  retirement
account at work. He completed  a  required  financial management  course  around  March  18,
2021, and  was granted  a  Chapter 7  bankruptcy  discharge  on  June  16, 2021.  (GE  4;  Tr.  30-
31.)
Applicant opened a credit-card account with a $600 credit limit in June 2021. He
made his payments on time and had a $387 balance on the account as of May 2022. (AEs
D-E.) His gross annual salary from his defense-contractor job is currently $111,900. (Tr.
33-34.) As of June 2022, he had approximately $2,000 in checking and almost $400 in
savings deposits. (Tr. 35.) In addition to his child support at $100 per week, he pays half of
his daughter’s childcare expense, which is currently at $105 per week. (Tr. 52.)
Applicant  has  not  used  marijuana  since  the  summer  of  2016  when  he  used
marijuana on three occasions with his ex-wife: one time at her parents’ home and the other
two times in their home. He does not intend to use marijuana in the future. He understands
that any future illegal drug use could affect his security clearance eligibility. (Tr. 30-31, 46.)
Applicant knew that, as a defense-contractor employee, marijuana use was not allowed.
(Tr. 46.)
Character References
A co-worker, who has known Applicant since 2010 when they served as radiological
control  technicians  together,  is  aware  that  Applicant  filed  for  divorce  and  to  evict  his
tenants. She first learned of the debt and drug issues in the SOR and of his bankruptcy in
preparing for her testimony with Applicant’s attorney. She has not seen any concerning
behaviors from Applicant with regard to his ability to safeguard classified information. (Tr.
55-60.)
Applicant’s direct supervisor for the last three to four years has known Applicant for
about ten years. Although not aware of the details, he knew well before Applicant’s hearing
that Applicant was going through a divorce and a bankruptcy, and that he had lost his
security clearance. The supervisor testified that he was aware of the issues of concern to
the Government, although it is unclear whether he knows that Applicant used marijuana in
the  summer  of  2016.  The  loss  of  Applicant’s  clearance  impacted  that  work  that  the
supervisor could assign to him. Applicant has been careful since then to ensure that he
does not work on classified matters. When Applicant held a clearance, he strictly complied
with security regulations. His supervisor does not consider Applicant to be a security risk.
He considers Applicant to be very patriotic. In their limited social interactions outside of
work, which includes helping Applicant with a couple of things at his home, this supervisor
has “definitely not” seen any signs of excessive spending on Applicant’s part. Applicant is
currently transitioning into being a lead shipper and does not need a security clearance to
perform that job, but if he regains his clearance eligibility, he would have more flexibility at
work. (Tr. 63-67.)
