After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I
make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 42 years old with no children. He was married from October 2004 until
his  divorce  in  August  2016.  Applicant  has  about  a  year  and  a  half  of  college  credits.
Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from January 2003 until July 2016,
when  he  was  honorably  discharged.  He  was  unemployed  from  June  20016  until  May
2017, while transitioning from the Air Force. For part of that time, from September 2016
until March 2017, Applicant was taking college courses.
Since May 2017, Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor. Applicant
attributes his financial difficulties to two factors. First, he was unemployed upon leaving
the Air Force. Second, during his marriage, Applicant had always allowed his spouse to
handle finances. In 2015, he was separated from his spouse and anticipated their divorce.
Applicant did not know that his spouse had not filed 2014 joint federal income tax returns.
Upon his separation and divorce, Applicant was unaware of the status of his credit cards.
He was divorced in August 2016, just after he left the Air Force. (Items 3 and 4.)
The SOR alleged seven delinquent accounts totaling $31,015. (Item 1.) Applicant
admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.b., c., f.,  and g.  He  denied  SOR  ¶¶ 1.a.,  d., and  e.  (Item 2.)  More
specifically, Applicant answered each SOR as follows:
SOR  ¶   1.a.  ($1,821   owed   to   the   IRS   for  failure  to   file   his  2014   tax   return):
Applicant’s documents showed that he made nine payments to the IRS under a plan from
2/22/21 to 8/20/21 (seven for $180, one for $32, and one for $327). This debt does not
appear on the Government’s credit reports. (Items 5 and 6.) Applicant disclosed this debt
in his SCA and discussed it in his personal subject interview. (Items 3 and 4.)
SOR  ¶   1.b.   ($14,133):  Applicant  answered  that  a  financial  advisor  told  him  to
rebuild his credit and let this debt expire due to age.
SOR ¶ 1.c. ($6,864): Applicant answered that a financial advisor told him to rebuild
his credit and let this debt expire due to age.
SOR ¶  1.d. ($4,786):  Applicant’s documents showed that he made 13 payments
under a plan from 8/14/20 to 7/14/21 (12 for $199 and one for $29).
SOR ¶  1.e.  ($1,664):  Applicant’s documents showed that he paid this debt in full
on March 17, 2021.
SOR ¶  1.f.   ($1,272): Applicant answered that having resolved several debts, he is
moving to pay this off.
SOR ¶ 1.g. ($475): Applicant answered that this debt is next in line and should be
paid in full by the end of October 2021. (Item 2.)
In  sum,  Applicant’s documents show  payments made  to  retire SOR ¶¶  1.a.,  d.,  and
e. totaling  $8,271.  Applicant did  not produce  any  documents relating  to  SOR ¶¶  1.b., c.,
f., and  g. totaling  $22,744. (Item 2  and  Response.)  In  his Response,  Applicant produced
an   April  21,  2022   letter  from   the   Department  of   Veterans   Affairs  verifying   his  monthly
disability   benefit   ($1,897).  He  also  produced   his  employment   pay   stubs  from   January
2022  to  August  2022  ($1979  every  two  weeks).  (Response.)   SOR ¶¶  1.b., c., f.,  and  g.
remain in  collections or  past due  on  Applicant’s credit reports.  (Items 5  and  6.)  Aside  from
the SOR debts,  Applicant’s  financial history  and current finances  are good.  (Item 4.)
Law and Policies
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
Supreme  Court  held,  “the  clearly  consistent  standard
that  security
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Department of the Navy
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).
indicates
The adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(a),
the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the
“whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a
A2(b)  requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to
classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In  reaching  this
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on
the  evidence  contained  in  the  record.  Likewise,  I  have  avoided  drawing  inferences
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.
Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish
controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or
mitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel,  and  has  the
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.”
A  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk
that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.
