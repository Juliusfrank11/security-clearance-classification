Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  SOR,  except  for  ¶¶  1.t.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with the defense contractor since 2019. He is divorced, and has two children,
ages  11  and  14.  (TR  at  page  14  line  6  to  page  17  line  4.)  He  attributes  much  of  his
financial  difficulties  to  his  divorce,  and  plans  to  address  these  difficulties  by  letting  his
admitted past-due debts fall off his credit report after seven years of delinquency. (TR at
page 35 line 16 to page 36 line 20.)
