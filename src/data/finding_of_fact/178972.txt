Applicant, age 45, has four children, ages 9, 15, 21, and 23. He married the mother
of his four children in 2000. Although scant on details, the record indicates that they have
been  separated  since  about  2016.  He  attended  a  university  from  2009  through  2012,
without earning a degree. He served honorably on active duty with the U.S. Army from
1996 through 2016. Since then, he has been employed by defense contractors: first, as
an instructor by Defense Contractor A from September 2016 through May 2018; and then
as a training analyst by Defense Contractor B from May 2018 through at least November
2018. On a date not identified in the record, he became employed by Defense Contractor
C  (for  whom  he  worked  at  the  time  he  received  the  SOR  in  November  2021  and  the
FORM  in  March  2022),  who  is  his  current  sponsor.  He  was  granted  a  DOD  security
clearance in about 1996 in connection with his military service.  (Items 1, 2; Item 3 at 6
and 9)
The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state tax income
tax  returns  for  tax  years  2017  and  2018.  It  also  alleged  a  $2,350  delinquent  federal
income tax debt for tax year 2019 and four other delinquent debts totaling $4,648. In his
Answer, Applicant admitted each SOR allegation and stated: “I will make sure all my debts
are paid in full. I made these debts and I accept full responsibility and consequences for
what lead to my action.” (Item 2)
Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years
2017 and 2018, as alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a (federal), 1.c (State A), and 1.d (State B). In
April 2019, the IRS granted him an extension to October 2019 to file his 2018 return. He
did not request an extension for his 2017 return. He was required to file 2018 returns in
two states due to his May 2018 relocation from State A to State B. He filed his 2017 and
2018 returns on May 24, 2021, and then timely filed his 2019 and 2020 returns. (AE I, J;
Item 1 at 3; Item 3 at 6, 13, 17, 18)
In February 2018, Applicant sought advice from a tax professional after he learned
that his spouse claimed their children as her dependents on her 2017 tax return. He was
advised  that  he  could  not  also  claim  their  children  on  his  2017  tax  return.  The  tax
professional estimated that he would owe taxes of about $7,000 and advised him to file
his 2017 return and then set up a payment plan for the amount owed. However, Applicant
opted not to timely file his 2017 return. He initially planned to wait until he could claim his
children as dependents on his 2018 return, at which time he would pay his 2017 tax debt.
He did not specifically address why he failed to follow through with his initial plan or the
reason he did not timely file his 2018 return. However, in his FORM response, Applicant
stated:
Waiting to take care of my issues was wrong but at the time I was financially
not able to do anything because I was going through personal problems that
led me not to fulfill my obligations. Not filing my taxes for 2017 and 2018 is
the first and only time I have ever missed filing my taxes. I know there is no
excuse that is good enough to not file taxes and for that I am truly sorry. I
own up to my faults and mistakes and will fix all my issues no matter how
long it takes me.
In his Answer, Applicant acknowledged that failing to timely file his returns “was wrong”
and a “lapse of judgment.” (FORM Response; Item 1; Item 3 at 6, 9)
Although  it  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  Applicant  failed  to  pay  federal  income
taxes  for  tax  years  2017  and  2018,  the  balances  of  which  were  $15,723  and  $4,743,
respectively, as of March 2022. I will consider those debts only to evaluate mitigation and
the whole-person concept. As alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b, he also failed to pay federal income
taxes for tax year 2019, the balance of which was $2,350 as of October 2021. The record
did not indicate whether he has any state tax debt. In April 2021, the IRS transferred a
$2,807 credit from his account to a 2016 federal tax debt and applied his tax year 2020
refund of  $1,804  to  unspecified  “non-IRS  debt.”  In his Answer,  Applicant attributed his
2019  tax  debt  to  his  filing  status  being  incorrect.  He  asserted  that  he  “made  some
corrections to fix that problem” and was “in  the process of trying to pay everything off.”
He stated: “I know its [sic] going to take some time, but I am going to make sure everything
is paid off because this is the first and only time, I have ever done anything like this.”  (AE
I, J; Item 1; Item 3 at 17, 18)
The $3,837 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e is a military exchange credit-card account
that was placed for collection. Applicant used the card to help pay household bills and to
buy  clothes  and  shoes  for  his  children.  The  debt  is  being  paid  through  $60  monthly
garnishments of Applicant’s military retirement pay. In his answer, Applicant stated that
he was making payments in addition to the garnishment. However, he did not specify the
amounts of those payments or proffer any documents to corroborate them. A February
2022 credit report showed a reduced balance of $3,744. (AE D at 27; Item 1 at 3; Item 2
at 40; Item 6 at 17-18; Item 3 at 10; Item 4 at 2; Item 5 at 2)
The $340 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f is a bill from a 2019 emergency room visit that
was placed for collection. Applicant was surprised by the bill because he thought it would
have been paid in full by either Tricare or his U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
disability benefits. He claimed that when he tried to pay the debt, the creditor told him that
it had been paid by the VA, and then he contacted the credit bureau agencies to remove
the  debt.  He  did  not  proffer  any  corroborating  documents.  However,  the  debt  did  not
appear on his recent credit reports. (AE D-F; Item 1 at 3; Item 4 at 3; Item 5 at 2)
The $86 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g is a dental bill placed for collection for which
Applicant was responsible to pay. He paid the debt in full in November 2021. (AE G; Item
1; Item 4 at 3; Item 5 at 2)
The $385 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h is an account that was charged off.  The type
of account was not indicated in the record. He paid $466 in January 2021 to resolve the
debt. (Item 4 at 4; Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 22)
There were additional delinquent debts revealed in the record that were not alleged
in the SOR. I will consider them only to evaluate mitigation and the whole person concept.
Five were revealed on Applicant’s June 2020 and April 2021 credit reports in the following
amounts:  $11,942  (1),  $11,833  (2),  $1,427  (3),  $909  (4),  and  $284  (5).  Another  was
reported  on  his  SCA:  a  $3,000  (6)  loan  account  that  was  charge-off  in  approximately
October 2014. During his November 2018 security clearance interview (SI), he disclosed
a January 2018 lawsuit filed by the creditor of a loan account (7) on which he had been
six months’ delinquent, and a $568 debt (8). He also confirmed seven other delinquent
debts totaling $8,137 (9) that were apparently listed on a credit report not included in the
record. (AE H; Item 2 at 39; Item 3 at 9; Items 4, 5)
In  February  2021,  Applicant  set  up  a  payment  plan  with  a  reduced  balance  of
$8,150 to resolve the $11,942 (1) debt in monthly installments of $170. He paid $170 in
February  2021.  His  last  payment  is  scheduled  for  January  2025.  He  did  not  proffer
documents to corroborate any payments he made pursuant to this plan  after February
2021. (Item 6 at 3, 12-14)
In  his SCA,  Applicant asserted that he had been “working to pay []off” the $11,833
(2) debt. During his SI, he explained that the  debt was a loan he took out in 2013 to help
pay  household bills. Although  the  creditor presented  a  settlement offer of  about $4,000  to
$5,000  for  him  to  resolve  debt, he  maintained  that he  was not  able  to  pay  that large  of  an
amount in the timeframe requested. (Item 2  at 39; Item  3 at 9-10)
In January 2021, Applicant paid the $1,427 (3) and $284 (5) debts in full, and a
reduced amount of $364 to resolve the $909 debt (4). During his SI, Applicant asserted
that the creditor called to present a settlement offer for the $3,000 debt  (6) in October
2018.  He  maintained  that  he  intended  to  call  them  back  to  set  up  a  payment  plan.
Between  January  2018  and  April  2018,  Applicant  made  monthly  payments  totaling
between $600 to $650 to settle the lawsuit debt (7). In August 2021, he “paid off or settled”
the $568 debt (8). The record did not contain sufficient information to determine the status
of the seven other delinquent debts totaling $8,137 (9). (AE H; Item 3 at 10Item 6 at 4, 5,
19, 20, 21)
In his SCA, Applicant attributed his indebtedness to “not making enough.” During
his SI, he attributed  his financial hardship  to a  period  that  began  in  April 2004,  due to
mental health struggles he experienced following his Iraq deployment. During that period,
he  gave  up  and  stopped  taking  care  of  his  financial  responsibilities,  which  he  found
overwhelming. While  he  was going  through  that hard time, he  “just  wasn’t sure how to
start paying off  all of his debt.” He sought and  continued to participate in mental health
counseling until 2017, which he  intended to resume in State B once he located a  new
counselor. He described his psychological health as “much  better.”  In a February 2021
response to DOHA-issued interrogatories, he stated:
There  is  no   reason   to   explain   my   actions  about  my   credit  being   in  the
position  that it is. I  was young, and  I didn’t think about what would happen
to  me. But I know  that  no  matter what I am  going  through  or what I went
through, I will never turn my  back on  my  country  or the  people I  swore  to
protect while  serving  in  the  Army.  (Item  2  at 39-41;  Item  3  at 11;  Item  6  at
6)
During   his  SI,   Applicant  proffered   a   plan   to   engage   the   services  of   a   credit
counseling   firm   to   assist  him   with   resolving   his  delinquent  debts.   At  that  time,  he   was
maintaining   two   households:  his   in   State   B,  and   his  wife   and   children   in   State   A.   He
relocated  to  State  B  for employment with  better pay. He intended  to  use  the  increased
income  to  “pay  off  all  of  his  debt and  provide  a  good  life  for himself  and  his  family.” He
was  unable   to   provide   a   specific  timeframe   for  a   full   debt   resolution   at  that   time.  The
record did not indicate  whether he  ever engaged the services of  that firm. (Item  3 at 11)
In  a  February  2021  personal  financial  statement  (PFS),  Applicant  reported  an
$8,073  monthly  net  income,  including  $1,194  military  retirement  pay  and  $3,931  VA
disability  pay.  He  estimated  a  $2,535  monthly  net  remainder.  His  two  February  2021
paystubs revealed that he took out a 401k loan at some point, for which he was repaying
$119 per pay period, and that his pay was being garnished for child support in the amount
of  $530  per  pay  period.  There  was  no  other  information  in  the  record  about  his  child
support obligation. Applicant provided three recent credit reports, one from each  credit
bureau  agency,  dated  February  2022.  They  revealed  that  he  opened  14  new  credit
accounts in the last two years. (AE D-F; Item 6 at 9-11)
In his FORM response, Applicant stated:
I enjoy  what I  do  and  working  alongside  America’s warfighters [fills] a  void
that was created  when  I took off  the  uniform. Not  then, now, or anytime  in
the  future  would I  ever put  my  country  or  the  warfighters  that  protect  me  and
my family in harm’s way regardless of my  financial situation. I  have  worked
diligently  to  take  care of  the  things mentioned  above  and  will continue  until
they  are dissolved. My love  for this country  and  patriotism  outweighs any
risk of  me being a threat to national security.
