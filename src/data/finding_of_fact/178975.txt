Applicant is  38  years old and  has never married. He  has  two  children,  ages  11  and
12. He enlisted in the  U.S. Navy  in 2003  at age 20. He received an  Honorable discharge
in August  2012.  After separating  from the  Navy, Applicant  took some  college  courses in
2013  and  was unemployed  until January  2014. Since  February  2014, he  has worked  for
a   Government  contractor as  a   specialist.   He   was  granted   national security   eligibility   in
2002  and  2014.  He seeks to  retain  his  eligibility  and a  security  clearance  in  connection
with  his  employment.  (Item  3  at Sections  13A, 15, 17, 18, 25.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible
for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable,
untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR
lists  13  debts  that  are  charged-off  or  in  collection.  The  total  amount  of  the  debts  is
approximately  $19,000.  The  existence  and  amount  of  these  debts  is  supported  by
Applicant’s admissions in his Answer to all but two SOR allegations (SOR 1.g and 1.m),
and by credit reports in the record dated March 15, 2022; May 6, 2021; and February 14,
2020.  The  debts  are  also  confirmed  by  Applicant’s  answers  to  interrogatories  and
comments  made  during  an  interview  with  an  investigator  from  the  Office  of  Personnel
Management (OPM) held on May 12, 2020. (Items 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.)
Applicant  advised  that  his  financial  delinquencies  consisted  of  unpaid  student
loans and some additional debts that arose due to his addiction to gambling. He wrote

debts listed in the SOR. (Answer at 1-2; Item 4 at 8; Item 8 at 8.)
