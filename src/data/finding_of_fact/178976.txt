Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 64-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She is employed as
a  linguist.  Applicant  is  married,  and  has  three  adult  children.  (TR at  page  16  line  3  to
page  19  line  6.)  She  attributes  her  current  financial  difficulties  to  difficulties  in  finding
employment as a deployed linguist because of her age. (TR at page 19 line 10 to page
26 line 12.)

about $6,733. Since the end of 2019, Applicant has been making monthly payments of
$75 towards this debt, as evidenced by documentation from a successor creditor to this
debt. Her current balance is $6,057. (TR at page 26 line 23 to page 29 line 8, and AppX

amounts  of  about  $17,243,  and  $4,705.  (TR  at  page  29  line  9  to  page  32  line  11,  at
page 34 line 20 to page 35 line 10, and at page 35 line 21 to page 37 line 7.) Despite

Applicant.
