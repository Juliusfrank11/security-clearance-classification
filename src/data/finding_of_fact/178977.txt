The  SOR  alleges  that  the  Applicant  is  indebted  to  eleven  delinquent  accounts
totaling  in  excess  of  $37,000.  Applicant  admits  all  of  the  debts  listed  in  the  SOR.
Credit reports of the Applicant dated March 21, 2020; and August 26, 2026, confirm the
indebtedness.  (Government Exhibits 5 and 6.)
Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  2007  through  2015,  and
was  honorably  discharged.  He  began  working  for  his  current  employer  in  September
2018.  He has had consistent employment, except for one brief period of unemployment
from April 2018 to September 2018.  (Government Exhibit 2.)
In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  attributes  his  excessive  delinquent
indebtedness to a divorce, that was finalized in 2015, and the loss of a job.  It is noted
that Applicantâ€™s divorce was seven years ago.  Why he waited so long to try to resolve
his debts is not known.  Applicant stated that he is now taking steps to repay the debts
at  a  pace  that  allows  him  the  opportunity  to  resolve  the  debts  a  few  at  a  time  while
remaining  capable  of  paying  all  of  his  current  financial  responsibilities  in  a  timely
manner.  His  plan  going forward  to  pay off  several debts  at a  time  and move  to  other
debs as resolution is achieved.  He stated that he plans to pay off all of his delinquent
debts.  He  also  stated  that  he  attempted  to  provide  documentation  to  show  the  debts
that are being paid off or have been resolved, but he is having difficulty retrieving those
documents.  (Government Exhibit 1.)
The following delinquent debts set forth in the SOR are of security concern:
1.a.  A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the
approximate amount of $10,265.  The debt remains owing.

payment  agreement.  There  is  no  documentation  to  show  that  the  debt  is  being  paid.

Applicant has failed to provide sufficient evidence in mitigation.  He has not made
a  good  faith  effort  to  address  his  delinquent  debts,  nor  has  he  taken  any  meaningful
step  to  resolve  the  delinquencies.  Applicant  submitted  evidence  to  show that  he  paid
one  debt,  allegation  1.i.,  and  that  he  entered  into  a  payment  arrangement  to  pay  the
debt  set  forth  in  allegation  1.e.  He  has  submitted  no  documentary  evidence  to  show
that  he  is  complying  with  the  payment  arrangement.  He  has  not  proven  that  he  has
established a meaningful track record of repayment and that his financial situation has
been  stabilized.  He  has  not  provided  evidence  showing  that  his  current  financial
situation is under control and that there is no risk of recurrence of the financial problems
at issue.
