Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer or a predecessor company on the same contract since December
2009.  He  is  a  high  school  graduate.  He  is  married  with  two  children,  ages  14  and  8.
(Items 3, 4)
Applicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts, unfiled
tax  returns,  and  unpaid  taxes.  The  SOR  alleges  six  delinquent  debts  totaling  about
$53,800  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.f),  and  that  Applicant  did  not  file  his  federal  (SOR  ¶  1.g)  and
state (SOR ¶ 1.h) income tax returns when they were due for tax years 2018 and 2019.1
Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations.
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  his  wife  losing  her  job,  his  son’s
medical problems, and helping his family members financially. He also admitted that the
financial  issues  were  due  to  his “being  a  young  irresponsible  adult  at  the  time,  putting
off  monthly bills  just  to  buy  the  latest  shoe  or  device  that  came  out.”  He  did  not  have
enough taxes withheld from his pay, so he owed taxes when it came time to file his tax
returns. (Item 3, 4; AE A, B)
Applicant  reported  his tax issues  and financial  problems on  a  Questionnaire  for
National Security Positions (SF 86) that he submitted in March 2020. He discussed the
same  issues  during  a  background  interview  in  April  2020.  He  stated  that  he  started
working with a debt consolidation service in March 2020. He stated that he was paying
$200 to $225 per month, and his delinquent debts were being handled by the service.
(Items 3, 4)
Applicant retained a tax expert. While he did not submit direct proof that the old
returns were filed, he submitted proof that he entered into an installment agreement with
the IRS in October 2021 to address taxes owed from 2012 and 2016 through 2019. He
agreed  to  pay  $150  per  month,  starting  in  November  2021,  to  increase  to  $365  per
month in November 2022. Applicant stated that the current balance owed to the IRS is
$25,865. He did not submit any documents about his state taxes. (AE A, B, D)
1  The SOR did not allege that Applicant owed back taxes. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will
not be used for disqualification purposes. It may be considered in the application of mitigating conditions
and in the whole-person analysis.
In  his  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  owed  the  $27,201
charged-off auto loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. The debt is listed on credit reports from July
2021  and  April  2022.  The  account  was  reported  as  opened  in  March  2020  and
becoming delinquent in June 2020. He did not discuss this debt during his background
interview in April 2020, but the credit reports indicate the debt was not delinquent at that
time.  In  his  response  to  the  FORM,  he  wrote  that  it  was  an  incorrect  reporting.  He
indicated that “a better rate was quoted to [him] which [he] took instead of this loan not
sure  why  it’s  reporting  in  a  delinquent  state.  This  car  loan  is  current  will  attach  ledger
proving so.” If Applicant has such a ledger, it was not submitted. (Items 2, 4-6; AE A, B)
Applicant reported the $12,852 charged-off auto loan (SOR ¶ 1.b) on his SF 86;
he  discussed  it during his background  interview;  and  he admitted  it  in  his response to
the SOR. The debt is listed on the 2021 Equifax credit report. The activity date is April
2018. The debt is not listed on the April 2022 Equifax credit report.  In his response to
the FORM, he wrote that the debt had been disputed by his credit consolidation service,
and he was awaiting resolution. (Items 2-6; AE A, B)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  a  $12,366  charged-off  auto  loan.  During  his  background
interview in April 2020, he agreed that the account was $1,176 and 30 days past due (a
credit report from 2020 was not submitted in evidence). He stated that since December
2020,  he  had  been paying an  extra  $100  per month  to bring the  account  current. The
credit  reports  from  2021  and  2022  indicate  the  debt  was  opened  in  May  2018  and
became  delinquent  in  June  2020.  The  April  2022  credit  report  indicates  that  the  last
payment date was March 2022, and the balance was $11,791, which was less that the
$12,366 balance reflected on the 2021 credit report. Applicant admitted owing the debt
in  his response to the SOR.  He  wrote  in his response  to  the  FORM  that  the debt  had
been disputed by his credit consolidation service for “failure to provide loan deficiencies
information.” He wrote that the debt “was in process to be resolved.”  (Items 2, 4-6; AE
A, B)
Applicant admitted owing the $632 (SOR ¶ 1.d) and $628 (SOR ¶ 1.e) charged-
off debts owed to the same credit union. He wrote in his response to the FORM that the
debts had been disputed by his credit consolidation service “to come to an agreement to
settle on,” and that the debts were “in progress to be resolved.” (Items 2, 4-6; AE A, B)
Applicant  initially  admitted  owing  the  $182  medical  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.f),  but  later
disputed it. The debt is identified only by an account number on the 2021 credit report
and in the SOR. It is not listed on the April 2022 credit report. (Items 2, 5-6; AE A, B)
Applicant stated that when his wife obtained a stable job, they took the necessary
steps to get everything in order. He has been working with a credit specialist and a tax
specialist.  His  financial  statement  shows  that  he  is  paying  $250  per  month  to  the  IRS
and $250 per month to a company that is apparently his credit specialist. The financial
statement  shows  net  monthly  income  of  $10,558;  monthly  expenses,  including
payments  to  the  IRS  and  credit  specialist,  of  $7,150,  and  a  remainder  of  $3,408.  He
