Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 1.a and denied ¶ 1.b in his Answer. He is 41 years old,
single, and does not have any children. (Answer; Tr. at 7, 11-12, 23, 52; GE 1)
Applicant graduated from high school in 1999 and earned an associate degree in
2006. He worked for a previous DOD contractor from approximately 2007 to 2014. As of
the date of the hearing, he worked as a principal designer for his employer, another DOD
contractor, since approximately November 2017. He has never held a security clearance.
(Tr. at 5, 7-9, 23, 29-30, 33; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  approximately  once  or  twice  a
month from about May 1999 to September 2020 (the date of the SOR), and he intended
to  continue  to  use  marijuana  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b).  Applicant  first  experimented  with
marijuana  in  the  summer  of  1999,  before  his  senior  year  of  high  school.  He  used  it  a
handful  of  times,  knowing  that  it  was  illegal.  He  listed  in  his  November  2019  security
clearance application (SCA) that he used marijuana from May 1999 to September 2019.
He indicated, during his January 2020 background interview, that he used marijuana one
to  two  times  monthly,  from  1999  to  December  2019,  and  he  acknowledged  that  his
December 2019 marijuana use occurred after he submitted his SCA. (SOR; Answer; GE
1, 2; Tr. at 15, 20, 23-24, 32-45, 53-68)
Applicant testified that after first experimenting with marijuana in 1999, he did not
use marijuana again until he was in college, between 2004 and 2006, using it “once in a
while  on  the  weekend.”  He  testified  that  he  did  not  use  marijuana  from  2006  to  2015,
when  he  worked  for  a  DOD  contractor,  because  he  did  not  want  to  jeopardize  his
employment. He testified that after he used marijuana in college, he did not use marijuana
again until 2016, when he used it to self-medicate after his father had a stroke. He used
marijuana once to twice monthly for anxiety relief, as a sleep aid, and to relax. He obtained
marijuana for his personal use from a friend and  he  used  it  alone or with  a  friend.  He
stated in his June 2020 interrogatory responses that he no longer personally possessed
marijuana and he used it recreationally, on occasion, with friends who purchased it. (SOR;
Answer; GE 1, 2; AE A; Tr. at 15, 21, 24-25, 27-45, 53-70)
Applicant testified that he had not used marijuana since November 2017, when he
began working for his employer, because he did not want to jeopardize his employment.
He testified that he erred, in his SCA and during his January 2020 background interview,
when he listed and indicated that he last used marijuana in 2019. He also testified that he
did  not  thoroughly  read  the  January  2020  background  interview  summary  when  he
adopted its accuracy in his June 2020 interrogatory responses. He also testified that he
erred when he admitted SOR ¶ 1.a in his Answer. He testified, “I just didn’t understand
what I was doing . . .,” as this was the first time he had undergone the security clearance
process. He maintained he was just trying to be honest and stated that he should have
sought advice from his Facility Security Officer (FSO). (SOR; Answer; GE 1, 2; AE A; Tr.
at 15, 21, 24-25, 27-45, 53-70)
In  October 2013, Applicant was charged  with  misdemeanor marijuana  possession.
A  police  officer pulled  him  over for a  tinted  license  plate,  the  officer smelled  marijuana,
and  Applicant admitted  to  the  officer  that he  had  marijuana  in his car. During  his  January
2020   background   interview,  he   indicated   that  he   obtained   the   marijuana   from   a   friend
because   he   needed   it   to   sleep   while   he   was  visiting   his  parents.   At  the   hearing,  he
testified, however, that  he  did not obtain the  marijuana  for his personal use. Rather, he
was simply  transporting  the  marijuana  for his  sibling  who  was going  through  a  divorce.
He  intended   to   offer  the   marijuana   to   his  sibling   as  a   way   for  his  sibling   to   relax.  He
testified  that  he  had  never used  marijuana  with  his  sibling. He  hired  an  attorney, appeared
in court, took an online  drug  education class, and  paid a  fine  of a couple hundred dollars
to  have  the  charge  expunged  from  his record. (SOR; Answer; GE  1, 2;  Tr. at  25-27, 45-
52)
Applicant  stated  in  his  2019  SCA  that  he  would  not  use  marijuana  if  he  were
required  to  stop.  He  indicated  during  his  January  2020  background  interview  that  he
planned to use marijuana once monthly because it was fun. When he was asked during
his second background interview on February 7, 2020 about his discrepant statements
regarding  his  future  intent  with  marijuana,  he  indicated  that  he  did  not  plan  to  use
marijuana in the future. He stated in his Answer and testified that he made his previous
statements about his future intent with marijuana under the idea that marijuana was legal
or  being  made  legal  under  state  law.  Upon  further  research,  he  testified  that  he
understood marijuana remained illegal under federal law, and he intended to comply with
both state and federal laws and abstain from marijuana use in the future.  He signed a
statement of intent in February 2022, in which he stated that he would abstain from any
drug involvement and substance misuse and acknowledged that any future involvement
or  misuse  would  be  grounds  for  revocation  of  his  national  security  eligibility.  (SOR;
Answer; GE 1, 2; AE A; Tr. at 21-22, 31-32, 37-38, 68-73)
Applicant  testified  that  he  manages  his  anxiety  by  living  an  active  and  healthy
lifestyle. He indicated during his January 2020 background interview and in his June 2020
interrogatory responses that he associates with an individual who uses illegal drugs, and
he clarified during his testimony that this individual is a friend who has a prescription for
the  medical  use  of  marijuana.  He  testified,  however,  that  he  no  longer  socializes  with
individuals who use marijuana, as he changed his social circle in approximately 2016. If
he were to find himself in a situation where marijuana was being used, he testified that
he would remove himself. He testified that he is not subject to random drug tests by his
employer. He was voluntarily drug tested by his doctor in January 2022 and the test did
not show any illegal drug use. (GE 2; AE A; Tr. at 21, 43-44, 68-73)
