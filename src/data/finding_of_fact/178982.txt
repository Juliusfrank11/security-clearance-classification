Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR allegations  in her Answer.  She  is 37  years old,
single,  and  she  does  not have  any  children.  She  graduated  from  high  school in  2003  and
attended  college  from  2003  to  2010  but did not earn  a  degree.  (Answer; Tr. at  17-18, 35-
38, 74;  GE 1, 2)
Applicant  was  unemployed  from  January  2006  to  August  2008,  and  from
September to December 2011. From approximately December 2011 to February 2015,
she worked as a temporary employee, through a staffing agency, for the same company
that she worked for as of the date of the hearing. As of the date of the hearing, she worked
as a compliance coordinator and an assistant facility security officer for her employer, a
DOD  contractor,  since  approximately  March  2015.  She  was  first  granted  a  security
clearance in approximately May 2018. (Answer; Tr. at 5, 18-23, 36-38, 73-74; GE 1, 2;
AE D)
The SOR alleged that Applicant had two delinquent consumer accounts totaling
approximately  $4,749  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  - 1.b),  a  $335  delinquent  medical  account  (SOR  ¶
1.c),  and  nine  delinquent  student  loans  totaling  $56,269  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  - 1.l).  The  SOR
allegations are established  by Applicant’s admissions in her Answer, her 2019 security
clearance application (SCA), a 2019 background interview, and by credit bureau reports
from 2017, 2019, and 2020. SOR debt ¶ 1.c is reported as delinquent on the 2017 credit
bureau report. All of the SOR debts are reported as delinquent on the 2019 credit bureau
report. SOR debts ¶¶ 1.a and 1.d through 1.l are reported as delinquent on the 2020 credit
bureau report. (Answer; GE 1-5)
Applicant attributes her delinquent debts to periods of unemployment from January
2006  to  August  2008,  and  from  September  to  December  2011;  an  unpaid  leave  of
absence  from  May  to  September  2011,  to  care  for  her  grandmother  who  became  ill;
minimal income from 2010 until 2015; and financial hardship in 2015 due to a relocation,
and residing and continuing to care for her ill grandmother, whose funeral expenses she
contributed  to  financially.  She  also  testified  that  she  discovered  that,  in  2019,  her  ex-
boyfriend stole her identity and opened around six accounts in her name, unbeknownst
to her. She disputed these debts as she learned about them. She acknowledged, during
her background interview, that she also incurred delinquent debts due to immaturity and
not living within her means. (Answer; Tr. at 29, 42, 51-58, 65-68, 76-77, 81-82; GE 1, 2)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b are for two charged-off credit cards, in the amounts of $1,144
and $3,605, respectively. Applicant testified that both of these credit cards were among
the accounts opened by her ex-boyfriend using her identity. She incorrectly believed she
disputed them, as she had with the other accounts he opened in her name. As of the date
of  the  hearing,  she  contacted  both  creditors  and  was  in  the  process  of  resolving  both
debts. (Answer; Tr. at 23-26, 51-58, 83; GE 1, 2)
SOR ¶ 1.c is for a $335 medical account in collection. Applicant believed this debt
was related to a surgery she had in 2009, which she understood was covered by medical
insurance. She spent two years trying to get her insurance company to pay for this debt.
She paid this debt in March 2018. (Answer; Tr. at 24-27, 61; GE 2, 5; AE A)
SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.l are for delinquent federal student loans totaling $56,269.
Applicant obtained both federal and private student loans to finance her college education
and  living  expenses  while  she  attended  college  from  2003  to  2010.  All  of  her  student
loans were in forbearance from 2010 until approximately 2011, due to minimal income. In
2013,  she  was  notified  that  her  federal  student  loans  were  approximately  $6,000
delinquent. She was unaware that they had been in a repayment status because she did
not  receive  the  bills,  which  were  sent  to  her  grandmother’s  old  residence.  She
unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a payment plan with  the  servicer for her federal
student loans between 2013 and 2018, and the servicer told her that she had to pay the
outstanding delinquency in full. In 2018, when her federal student loans were switched to
a  different  servicer,  she  entered  into  an  automatic  payment  plan  of  $5  monthly  for
approximately  12  to  18  months  and  made  timely  payments  in  accordance  with  her
payment plan. (Answer; Tr. at 27-29, 32, 35-47, 49-50, 58-68, 70-75, 77-83; GE 1, 2; AE
B)
Applicant’s  federal  student  loans  were  placed  in  forbearance  through  executive
order  in  2020,  due  to  the  Covid-19  pandemic.  As  of  January  2022,  they  remained  in
forbearance.  She  intended  to  resume  payments  even  while  her  federal  student  loans
were in forbearance, and she planned to timely pay her federal student loans once they
were no longer in forbearance. Unlike her federal student loans, she has been repaying
her  private  student  loans  since  2011.  She  made  payments  according  to  a  monthly
payment plan that progressively increased from $25 to $356 monthly, as of the date of
the hearing. She was current on her private student loans, and she estimated that the
total balance of her private student loans was $30,000. (Answer; Tr. at 27-29, 32, 35-47,
49-50, 58-68, 70-75, 77-83; GE 1, 2; AE B)
Applicant stated that she lived within her means, she timely paid her bills, and she
intended to continue to timely pay her bills in the future. She rents her mother’s second
home, and her mother was in the process of putting Applicant’s name on the deed. She
paid her mother $1,200 monthly for the mortgage payment and she also paid for all of the
household  expenses.  She  has  a  monthly  net  remainder  of  approximately  $2,500  after
expenses,  and  she  has  approximately  $20,000  in  savings  and  $200,000  in  retirement
savings.  She  described  her  financial  situation  as  “great.”  She  monitors  her  credit  to
prevent future identity theft and she did not have any other delinquent debts.  She also
stated  that  she  received  credit  counseling  in  2012  and  again  in  2019.  In  addition,  her
mother, who has a financial background, has provided her with credit counseling, helped
her develop a budget, and has assisted her with getting her finances in order since 2018.
Letters of recommendation from Applicant’s co-worker, a friend, and a family member, all
attested to Applicant’s trustworthiness, integrity, and work ethic. (Tr. at 20-21, 25, 29-34,
37-38, 42, 47-49, 54-55, 58-61, 66-69, 75-78, 82-85; GE 1; AE C, E)
