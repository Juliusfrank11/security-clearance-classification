In  his  answer  to  the  SOR, Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  contained  in SOR  ¶¶
1.a through  1.f.  His admissions  are accepted  as findings of  fact.
Applicant is 35 years old and divorced since 2021. He lives with his girlfriend. He
has two children with his former wife and a child with his girlfriend. In 2018, he earned an

the past six years. He is a supervisor. (Tr. 14-17)
Applicant has a history of illegally using cannabis. In November 2003, Applicant
was arrested and charged with possession of cannabis. This charge was dismissed, but
he was required to complete 50 hours of community service and one year of supervision.
In April 2005, he was arrested and charged with driving under the influence (DUI) of drugs,
possessing  cannabis,  improper  display  license  plate,  and  registration  expiration.  The
charges were dismissed after proving he was not under the influence of cannabis and no
cannabis  was  found  in  his  car.  In  December 2005,  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with
possession of cannabis and drug paraphernalia.  This charge was dropped. (Tr. 22-24;
GE 2 at 9, 11; GE 3)
In February 2010, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony cultivation of
cannabis  plants,  manufacturing/delivering  cannabis,  and  possession  of  cannabis.  He
pleaded  guilty  to  production  of  cannabis,  a  felony.  He  was  fined  $9,323,  placed  on
probation for two years, and ordered to perform 200 hours of community service. (Tr. 24;
GE 2 at 10; GE 3)
In  his April 2017  security  clearance  application  (SCA), Applicant disclosed  his 2003
and  two  2005  misdemeanor charges and  his 2010  felony  conviction,  all  of which involved
the  illegal use  and  possession  of cannabis.  (GE 1  at  30-32) He  wrote  in  his SCA  that  he
“quit smoking  completely  when  I pursued  a  position  with  a  [defense  contractor] last  year.”
(GE 1  at 34) In  his August 2018  background  interview  about the  information  in his SCA
(more   than   a   year  after  submitting   his SCA),  Applicant   discussed   in  detail   his   criminal
activity  involving  cannabis.  He  told  the  investigator that he  only  used  cannabis  on  special
occasions and  would stop  using  it if  necessary  to  obtain a  security  clearance. (GE 2  at
14) In  his November 2019  Interrogatories, Applicant stated  that he  used  cannabis on  a
regular basis and  intended  to  use  it  in  the  future.  He said he  used  it  with  his  girlfriend.
(GE 2 at 2-3)
While  testifying,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  purchased  and  used  cannabis  with
varying frequency from about August 2001 through November 2019. He used it the week
before his hearing.  He uses  it a  couple times  a  week  as  a leisure activity to  relax.  He
believes that holders of security clearances are permitted to use marijuana. He said he is
not addicted to it, and could stop if necessary to keep his job. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 18-20,
27)
Applicant said he no longer associates with the people with whom he was involved
at  the  time  of  his  arrests.  He  does  not  use  cannabis  with  any  person  other  than  his
girlfriend (now wife), who has a medical marijuana card. (Tr. 18-9, 25-26) He stated he
did not use marijuana for a couple years prior to 2009. (Tr. 20-22)
Applicant  stated  that  he  was  unaware  that  as  an  employee  for  a  defense
contractor, he was prohibited from using cannabis as it is illegal under federal law.  He
thought that because his state legalized cannabis that the federal government did too. He
said he is not subject to drug testing at his job. (Tr. 27-30)
