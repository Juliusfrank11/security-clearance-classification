Applicant, age 33, divorced his wife of three years in 2019. They separated in 2017.
They share custody of two children, ages 7 and 8. Although it was not court ordered, they
agreed that Applicant would pay $800 per month for child support. (Item 3; Item 7)
Applicant served on active duty as an enlisted member of the U.S. Air Force from
2012 until 2017, and then as an inactive reservist until 2019. He received his high school
diploma in 2006, and a bachelor’s degree in computer electronics engineering technology
in about January 2020. He has been employed as a field service representative by the
defense contractor sponsoring his SCA since November 2019. He was previously granted
a DOD security clearance on a date not indicated in the record. (Item 3)
The  SOR  alleged  10  delinquent  debts  totaling  $48,688,  including  five  federal
student loans totaling $38,634. In his Answer, Applicant admitted all but one of the alleged
debts.  His  admitted  debts  totaled  $45,588.  Each  of  the  SOR  allegations  were  also
confirmed by his May and December 2021 credit reports. (Items 5-6)
Applicant took out the aforementioned student loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.g) to
pay for his bachelor’s degree. The May 2021 credit report shows the date the loans were
opened as: July 2008 (SOR ¶ 1.c), December 2007 (SOR 1.d), July 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.e),
April 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.f), and October 2006 (SOR  ¶ 1.g). During his June 2021 security
clearance  interview  (SI),  he  stated  that  he  attended  university  from  September  2006
through  January  2020.  He  also  averred  that  after  graduation,  he  was  able  to  obtain
deferments  two  times.  He  was  not  able  to  provide  the  dates  of  the  deferments  or  the
amount of the loans at the time of the deferments. Information in his credit reports indicate
the loans have been in delinquent status since about June 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.c) and July
2019 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.g). The record did not address these discrepancies. (Item 5
at 4-5; Item 6 at 2-7; Item 7 at 3)
Applicant contacted the collection agent for his student loans on the morning of his
SI and was offered a repayment plan. He maintained that he could not afford the $330
per month required of that plan, but intended to contact the agent again after his SI to try
to negotiate  the monthly payment  down to $200, which  was an amount he  maintained
that he could afford to pay. He attributed his delay in contacting the collection agent to his
belief that his loans were in forbearance. In his Answer, Applicant asserted that he was
resolving  the  student  loan  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.c  through  1.g  through  an  income-based
repayment plan. However, he did not provide any corroborating documents. (Item 2; Item
7 at 3-4)
Applicant  did   not  assert  that  his  student  loans   were  subject   to   the   current
emergency   relief  available  for  federal  student  loans,   nor  did   the   statements  he   made
during his SI and in his Answer indicate such. However, I sua sponte  took administrative
notice  of  the  fact that,  beginning  March 13,  2020,  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic, the
U.S. Department  of Education  has been  providing   emergency  relief for federal student
loans, including  the  suspension of loan  payments and collections on defaulted loans. On
April 6, 2022, President Biden extended that COVID-19 relief  through August 31, 2022.1
Applicant denied the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($100) on the basis that it is unknown to
him. Despite his research, he has not found a way to contact the creditor to confirm the
debt. In his Answer, he  stated that had  “disputed this account.” The  debt in SOR ¶  1.a
appeared on his May 2021 credit report, but not his December 2021 credit report. (Items
2, 4, 5)
Applicant paid  the  debt  in SOR ¶  1.j ($81) and  intends to  pay  the  debts in SOR ¶¶
1.b  ($1,125), 1.h  ($2,992), and  1.i ($5,756) once  he  refinances his home  mortgage. The
debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  is related  to  a  military  exchange  credit-card  account. The  debts  in SOR
¶¶  1.h  and  1.i are related  to  two  consolidation  loans he  took out to  pay  off  car loans. He
used   the   first  one   in   September  2016   (SOR  ¶   1.i)  to   pay   off   the   remaining   balance   of
Truck  A.  He  financed   the   $42,000   purchase   of   Truck  A   in  2015   with   a   $572   monthly
payment. After about  a  year, he  realized  that he  could no  longer afford the  payments so
he  sold Truck A  leaving  a  remaining  balance  of  about $10,000, which was charged  off  by
the  bank. The  record did not indicate  why  the  reported  balance  due  is $5,756  given  that
Applicant has not made  any  payments on  the  account since  it was charged  off. He used
the  second  consolidation  loan   in  July  2017  (SOR ¶  1.h) to  pay  off  a $2,992  deficiency
balance  remaining  after Truck  B  was repossessed  due  to  nonpayment in  2017  or  2018.
During  his SI,  he  acknowledged  that he  had  never contacted  the  creditors about the  debts
in  SOR   ¶¶   1.b,   1.h   or  1.i.   In   his   Answer,  he   asserted   that   he   was  “in   the   process   of
refinancing  [his] home  in order to  get all  my  account [sic] back into  good  standing,” and
“working  to  set  up  a  repayment  plan” to  resolve  the  debt in  ¶  SOR 1.b.  (Items  2,  5,  6;  Item
7 at 5)
During  his  SI,  Applicant  disclosed  a  third  vehicle  that  had  been  repossessed  in
2018 due to nonpayment. He financed the $20,900 purchase of this vehicle in 2016 with
a $350 monthly payment. He asserted that he fell behind in payments because he could

no  longer  afford  the  monthly  payment.  In  September  2020,  he  settled  the  debt  for  an
amount he could not recall. (Item 5 at 9; Item 7 at 4)
Applicant opened all of the accounts underlying his non-student loan debts during
his marriage. He relied  on  his wife’s  income to pay those bills. He asserted that, once
they separated (on a date not indicated in the record), he was “forced to take on all the
financial burden and simply could not do it alone.” In his Answer, he maintained that “I’m
actively trying to resolve  financial conflicts  the  best  and  most efficient way  I can  .  . .  .”
(Item 2; Item 7 at 3)
Applicant sought help from a debt relief company in about 2020 to assist him with
resolving his debts. However, he was unable to recall any details about their agreement,
including which debts were involved, the amount he paid the company each month, and
the extent to which the company assisted him with his debts. He was not certain for how
long he worked  with  the  company,  but estimated about one  year.  He asserted  that he
stopped working with them because he could no longer afford the monthly payments. He
did not indicate whether the company provided him with any financial counseling. (Item 7
at 4)
Applicant  also  attributed  his financial  situation  to  other factors  in  addition  to  his
separation and divorce, including his own financial irresponsibility. In his SCA, he reported
that his 2018 DWI conviction negatively impacted his finances. During his SI, he explained
that he fell behind on his mortgage payments following the DWI. He was able to bring the
mortgage  current  through  a  loan  modification.  He  has  prioritized  paying  expenses
associated with the care of his children, including a keeping a roof over their heads, gas
in the car for transportation to get them to daycare and him to work, and paying for food
and utilities. (Item 3 at 37-38, 40; Item 4 at 6; Item 5 at 5; Item 7 at 3)
Applicant  reported earning a  monthly salary of  about  $5,000  per month in  June
2021 and October 2021. He reported income and expenses that left him with a monthly
net remainder of $954 as of July 2021 and $240 as of October 2021 (due to increased
car and childcare expenses). During his SI, he indicated that he was trying to get a raise
to  help  him  repay  bills.  His  December  2021  credit  report  revealed  no  new  delinquent
debts. (Item 4 at 6-7; Item 5; Item 7 at 5-6, 9)
