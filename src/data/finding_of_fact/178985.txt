1.f, 1.g, and 1.h. He denied the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c., and 1.e.
Applicant is 37 years old and unmarried. He graduated from high school in 2002,
and subsequently earned an associate’s degree in electronics. He has two children, one
with his former girlfriend A, and one with his former girlfriend B. He enlisted in the Marine
Corps  Reserve  in  2003  and  was  honorably  discharged  in  2007.  He  held  a  security
clearance  while  in  the  Marines.  (Tr.  17-19,  39)  After  his  discharge,  he  worked  in
construction from 2007 to 2013. He worked for a defense contractor in the Middle East
from about 2015 to 2017.  He then started a cruise business with a friend, which he closed
in 2018 due to financial problems. In September 2019, he submitted a security clearance
application for a job with a different defense contractor and anticipated returning to the
Middle East when he received a security clearance. (GE 1, GE 4; AE D)
On  December  25,  2020,  Applicant  became  embroiled  in  a  serious  physical
argument with his former girlfriend B. It became violent and the police were called. He
was  arrested  and  charged  with  aggravated  battery,  a  felony.  He  pleaded  guilty  to  the
charge  and  was  immediately  incarcerated.  He  served  13  months  in  prison  and  was
released  on  January  19,  2022.  He  is  on  supervised  probation  for  three  years  and  is
required to attend counseling, anger management and parenting classes. (Tr. 20-25)
Since  his release from prison,  Applicant  has been  working as  a forklift  operator
and is not earning enough money to resolve his debts. He is trying to repair his credit by
removing negative inquiries. (Tr. 26-27) He said he lost a lot of money when he had his
cruise  business  between  2017  and  2018,  which  accounts  for  some  of  his  delinquent
debts. He would like to find a job in the trucking industry that pays more money and would
allow him to resolve debts. He lives with girlfriend A and their child. (Tr. 38-41)
Base on credit bureau reports (CBR) from September 2020 and September 2019,
the SOR alleged eight delinquent debts totaling about $93,000, which became delinquent
between 2018 and 2020. (GE 2, GE 3) Applicant said he sent letters to all of his creditors
a week before the hearing. requesting information about the alleged debts, but had not
received a response as of the hearing date. (Tr. 29, 34) The status of each debt is as

card. Applicant denied owing it because he does not have any recollection of
it. He would pay it if it is his debt. It is unresolved. (Tr. 28.)
3.  The debt in SOR  ¶ 1.c for $2,896 is owed to Midland for a delinquent credit
