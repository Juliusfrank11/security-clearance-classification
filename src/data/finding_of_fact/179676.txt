Applicant,  38,  has  worked  in  technical  support  since  December  2017.  Although
he  has  worked  in  the  same  position,  his  federal  contactor  employer  has  changed.  He
completed  a  security  clearance  application  in  March  2020,  and  did  not  disclose  any
disqualifying  information.  The  ensuing  investigation  revealed  that  he  owed  $45,458  in
delinquent debt. (GE 3 - 5)
Applicant  served  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  February 2003  to  June  2010. While  he
was stationed in Germany, he met his wife, a German citizen, whom he married in May
2007.  After  his  separation  from  the  U.S.  Army,  he  remained  in  Germany.  Although  he
took college classes between 2011 and 2017, he did not earn a degree. Professionally,
Applicant  worked  part  time  as  a  civilian  employee.  In  October  2016,  he  decided  to
return to the United States, living and working for one year before returning to Germany.
(GE 3)
In July 2017, Applicant began working on a U.S. military installation. It is unclear
if  he  did  so  as  a  civilian  employee  or  as  a  federal  contractor  employee.  He  left  the
position in November 2019, after accepting his current position. (GE 3)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  14  creditors  for  $45,458  in
delinquent debt. The majority of that amount, 63%, is for four delinquent  student loans
totaling $28,813 (SOR ¶¶1.a – 1.d). The next largest delinquent debt, SOR ¶ 1.o, is the
deficiency balance on a  car repossession for $7,021, followed  by a delinquent  debt  to
another government agency for $2,622 (SOR ¶ 1.p). The remaining debts are consumer
accounts.
Applicant admits owing the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a  –  1.h and 1.j –  1.n. He
has  contacted  the  creditors  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.f  and  1.h  and  inquired  about  how  to
return the accounts to good standing. He admits owing a deficiency balance on the car
repossession  in  SOR  ¶  1.o,  but  disagrees  with  the  SOR  allegation  as  to  the  amount
owed.  He  denies  the debts alleged  in  SOR ¶¶  1.i  and 1.r,  because  he does not know
their origins. He denies SOR ¶ 1.q claiming that it is a duplicate of SOR ¶ 1.m. He does
not provide any answer or explanation for SOR ¶ 1.p, the delinquent debt owed to the
other government agency. (GE 1-2)
Applicant  blames  his  financial  problems  on  earning  insufficient  income  after
separating from the Army in June 2010. Currently, he and his wife earn enough  money
to pay their recurring bills. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant expressed his intention
to  repay  his  outstanding  delinquent  debt  by  paying  off  what  he  can  immediately  and
using  a  debt  consolidation  loan  to  address  the  other  debts.  He  did  not  provide  any
corroborating evidence of this plan. (GE 2,3)
