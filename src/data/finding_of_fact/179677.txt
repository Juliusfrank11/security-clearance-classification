In  Applicant’s  answer,  he  admitted  the  allegation  in  the  SOR.  I  adopt  his
admission as a finding of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and
exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. (Item 3)
Applicant is 35 years old. He is single, never married. He has worked as a quality
specialist for his current employer, a federal contractor, since 2020. He received a high
school diploma in 2005. He honorably served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps
from 2007 to 2015. He held a security clearance while in the Marine Corps. (Items 4-6)
The SOR alleged Applicant falsified material facts on his August 2020 SCA when
he answered that he had  used marijuana from June 2003 to December  2019 and that
he intended to use marijuana in the future, when in actuality he had not used marijuana
since 2007 and he had no intentions of using it in the future. (Item 1)
Applicant listed his uses of marijuana as alleged above in his August 2020 SCA.
He  also  stated  that  in  the  SCA  that  he  intended  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future.  In  an
earlier  SCA  from  April  2012,  that  he  completed  while  in  the  Marine  Corps,  he  denied
any uses of illegal drugs, including marijuana within the last seven years. (Items 4-5)
In September 2020, Applicant was interviewed by a background investigator and
was asked about his 2020 SCA admissions to marijuana use. Applicant admitted that he
lied on his 2020 SCA about his prior marijuana uses. He clarified that he had not used
illegal  drugs,  including  marijuana,  since  2007  when  he  joined  the  Marine  Corps.  He
further  explained  that  he  lied  about  using  marijuana  from  2008  to  2019  because  he
decided he did not want to be considered for a security clearance. He believed that if he
gave  disqualifying  information,  such  as  recent  illegal  drug  use,  he  would  not  be
considered for a security clearance. He went on to tell the investigator that he regretted
his decision to lie about his drug use. He restated that he has not used any illegal drugs
since he was approximately 20 years old and before he was a Marine. (Item 6)
In  June  2021,  Applicant  answered  interrogatories  as  part  of  the  adjudicative
process  for  his  clearance.  He  was  again  asked  to  explain  his  reason  for  lying  on  his
August  2020  SCA  about  using  marijuana  beyond  2007.  He  stated  that  he  was  not
happy  with  his  job  and  thought  if  he  could  get  disqualified  from  having  a  clearnce  he
might  also  be  “let  go”  by  his  employer,  thereby  allowing  him  to  collect  unemployment
until the Covid pandemic was over. His disqualifier would be his fictitious drug use after
2007. (Item 6)
