Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  13  delinquent  debts
totaling about  $250,000.  He  admitted  all of  the  allegations of  the  SOR.  His  admissions
are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
record evidence, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 36 years old. He has never married and has no children. He earned a
medical  degree  from  a  foreign  university  in  December  2011.  He  has  worked  for  a
Federal  contractor as a medical clerk  since March  2020. The  pending e-QIP is his first
application for a trustworthiness determination.  (Tr. at 20-24, 29-32.)
Applicant attended two years of college in the United States studying accounting.
He decided to change his career plans, and in 2005, he was accepted to study medicine
in a university in Country A. The program involved four years of classwork and one year
of  practical  experience  in  Country  A.  He  graduated  in  2011  as  a  doctor  qualified  to
practice  medicine  in  that  country.  He  has  also  received  a  U.S.  certificate  on  medical
coding and billing.  He is presently  pursuing  a  master’s degree  in  nutrition  in the United
States. (Tr. at 23-34, 36-37, 50-52.)
Applicant  borrowed  the  funds  to  pay  for  his  medical  school  tuition,  which  was
approximately  $178,000  (see  below).  These  student  loans  were  part  of  a  special
program  for  individuals  who  held  citizenship  in  both  the  United  States  and  Country  A.
Dual  citizens  like  Applicant  paid  a  higher  tuition  than  those  students  who  were  only
citizens  of  Country  A.  After  completing  his  education,  he  was  required  to  perform  one
year  of  “social  service”  in  a  small  village  in  Country  A.  He  was  paid  the  equivalent  of
about  $45  per month.  In  his  e-QIP,  he  wrote  that  he  worked  as  an  intern  in  Country A
until  March  2014.  He  was  actually  unemployed  from  January  2013  to  March  2014.  He
was unsuccessful finding employment in Country A as a doctor, and he returned to the
United States. Applicant experienced periods of unemployment in 2016-2017 and again
in  2019.   He   seeks   eligibility   for  a   position   of   public  trust  in  relation   to   his  employment.
(Tr. at  28-36, 51-53; GE 1  at 13-15.)
Applicant does not agree that his student loan debt is as much as alleged in the
SOR. He wants to review his borrowing history with his foreign university to have a better
understanding of his indebtedness. He has very little information about any of his debts.
(Tr. at 26, 42-43, 46.)
According to the record evidence, the current status of the debts listed in the SOR
is as follows:
1.a  through  1.d.  Student  loans  in  collection  totaling  approximately  $111,000.
These four loans were for the tuition expenses for the first four semesters of Applicant’s
medical  school  education.  They  were  private  loans  through  a  U.S.  bank.  In  2011  or
2012,  the  loans  became  due  for  repayment,  and  the  creditor  started  garnishing  his
paycheck in the amount of about $70 per month. He requested that the payments cease
because he could not afford them. He testified that three or four years ago he called the
creditor  and  explained  his  financial  situation.  The  creditor  decided  not  to  try  to  seek
repayment at that time. Since then he has been unable to make any payments on these
loans. They are not  presently in deferment or rehabilitation status, and they have been
placed  for  collection.  GE  4  reflects  that  the  original  amounts  of  these  loans  totaled
approximately $79,000. The amounts of the debts have increased due to interest over a
period of about ten years. These debts are not resolved. (Tr. at 37-41; GE 3 at 4-5; GE 4
at 1-2; GE 5 at 2-3; GE 6 at 7-8.)
1.e.  Credit-card  account  in  collection  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $1,926.
Applicant  opened  this  account  to  purchase  a  cell  phone.  He  recalls  paying  on  the
account  but  was  subsequently  unable  to  continue  the  payments.  The  creditor  referred
the  account  to  a  collection  agency.  This  collection  account  is  for  the  same  credit-card
debt as the one listed in SOR 1.m, below. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 41-42; GE 3
at 2; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 4; GE 6 at 8.)
1.f  through  1.i.  Student loans in collection totaling approximately $63,000. These
four loans are Direct Loans made by the U.S. Department of Education (DOE). Applicant
has  never  been  able  to  make  any  payments  on  these  loans.  He  has  never  applied  to
DOE for a deferment or forbearance. He has also never sought to enter into an income-
based repayment or a loan-rehabilitation plan. The loans have been placed for collection.
GE  4  reflects  that  the  original  amounts  of  these  loans  totaled  approximately  $41,000.
These debts are not resolved. (Tr. at 42-64; GE 4 at 3-4; GE 5 at 2-3; GE 6 at 8-9.)
1.j and  1.k.  Student loans in collection totaling approximately $33,000. These two
student loans were granted under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFEL),
which were private loans subsidized and guaranteed by the U.S. Government. Applicant
has  been  unable  to  make  any  payments  on  these  loans.  He  has  never  applied  for  a
deferment  or  forbearance.  He  has  also  never  sought  to  enter  into  an  income-based
repayment or a loan-rehabilitation plan. The loans have been placed in collection. GE 4
reflects  that   the   original  amounts  of   these   loans   totaled   approximately   $17,000.  These
debts are not resolved.   (Tr. at 42-46; GE  4 at  4; GE 5  at 2; GE 6  at 8.)
1.l.  Student  loan in  collection  in the amount of  approximately $41,000.  This loan
was  a  private  loan  through  the  same  U.S.  bank  that  provided  Applicant  with  the  loans
discussed  in  1.a  though  1.d,  above.  The  credit  reports  in  the  record  reflect  that  the
$41,000 amount  is the original amount of  this  loan. The record contains no  information
regarding the current amount due on this loan. Applicant has been unable to make any
payments on this loan, and the loan has been assigned to the U.S. Government as the
guarantor of the loan. This debt is not resolved. (Tr.at 46-48; GE 4 at 6; GE 5 at 4; GE 6
at 6.)
1.m.  Credit-card  account  charged  off  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $1,343.
Applicant  opened  this  account  in  January  2015,  and  he  defaulted  on  paying  it  in
December  2016.  The  creditor  charged  off  this  account  and  assigned  it  to  a  collection
agency. Applicant believes this is the same account as the one listed in SOR 1.e, above.
The  record  evidence  confirms  that  the  two  accounts  are  for  the  same  debt.  The  debt
amount  of  $1,343  is  the  original  charged-off  amount.  The  amount  alleged  in  SOR  1.e
($1,926) is the more recent amount Applicant owes to the collection agency. (Tr. at 42,
47; GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 5; GE 5 at 4.)
Based  upon  the  information  available  in  Applicant’s  credit  reports  in  the  record
summarized above, Applicant borrowed about $178,000 for his medical school education
during  the  period  2005  to  2011.  With  ten  years  of  accrued  interest,  the  current  total
amount  of  his  student  loans  is  about  $248,000.  Applicant  has  received  no  financial
counseling and has no plan except to investigate the current amounts of the debts he is
advised  that  he  actually  owes.  At  this  point  he  cannot  afford  to  repay  these  debts.  He
summarized  his  position  on  his  student  loans,  stating:  “as  I  see  right  now  it’s  going  to
take me forever to repay these back. But I have to do it.” (Tr. at 48-49.)
