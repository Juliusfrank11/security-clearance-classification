The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of October 27, 2021, Applicant owed
seven charged-off debts for $12,164 (SOR ¶ 1.a), $11,100 (SOR ¶ 1.b), $1,038 (SOR ¶
1.c), $5.497 (SOR ¶ 1.d); $3,281 (SOR ¶ 1.g), $5,542 (SOR ¶ 1.h). and $3,457 (SOR ¶
1.i); two collection debts for $5,753 (SOR ¶ 1.e) and $8,218 (SOR ¶ 1.j); and a past-due
account for $5,945 (SOR ¶ 1.k). Under Guideline E, Applicant allegedly communicated
from September 2017 to June 2018 with a person whom she believed was a well-known
actor, and, at his request, sent him gift cards and money, and provided him with her Social
Security number so that he could open credit-card accounts in her name resulting in the
delinquent debts (SOR ¶ 2.a).
When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, she admitted the delinquent debts,
but  explained  in  response  to  the  Guideline  E  allegation  that  it  was  a  scam;  that  the
impostor promised to pay off the credit-card debts that she incurred for him; and that he
threatened her. In an attached statement, she stated that she was “vulnerable and gullible
in 2017” after her divorce, but that when she realized she made a “huge mistake,” she
retained the services of a lawyer to work with her creditors to forgive the debts because
she was a scam victim. She indicated that it would never happen again. (Answer.)
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 57 years old, twice divorced, and has a 25-year-old son. (GE 1.) She
earned an associate’s degree in May 1985. (GE 2.) She has worked as a “PC” technical
specialist for a defense contractor since January 2010. (GE 1; Tr. 16.)
Applicant and her second husband divorced in June 2016 after almost ten years of
marriage.  She  moved  into  her  current  address  in  August  2016.  She  bought  her
condominium outright with funds from her divorce settlement. (Tr. 32.)
Applicant had a difficult time emotionally after her divorce. She obtained counseling
and asserts that an actor helped her through that time in that she derived pleasure from
watching him act on a show that she enjoyed. (Tr. 18, 38.)
In  approximately September 2017,  Applicant  began  communicating via  a  social
media messaging application with a person who identified himself as the actor, but who
was an impostor. Applicant responded that she would like to meet him, and he told her to
make a reservation through his agent. Applicant filled out a form electronically and sent him
$3,000 through his purported agent. She withdrew the $3,000 from her 401(k) account.
After several messages between them, Applicant was convinced she was communicating
with the actor. At the impostor’s request, she procured and sent him several ITunes cards.
She willingly provided him with her address and Social Security number, which he used to
open credit-card accounts in her name for cards sent to her at her home address. She
used the credit cards to purchase ITunes cards and obtain cash advances that she wired
to  the  impostor  at  various  addresses  in  the  United  States  and  abroad.  The  impostor
repeatedly promised to pay the balances on the accounts and did so initially, but some of
his payments were rejected for insufficient funds. (GE 2; Tr. 17-23, 31.) Given the actor’s
professional success, Applicant questioned the impostor about why he did not purchase his
own  ITunes  cards.  She  does  not  now  recall  his  response  other  than  it  was  “some
nonsense” to keep her believing that she would meet him. (Tr. 38.) She never asked what
happened to all the cash advances she sent. (Tr. 43.)
The impostor eventually proposed that he and Applicant start a clothing business
together, and he told her he needed money for the start-up costs. (GE 2; Tr. 22.) Although
he never sent Applicant a business plan or told her how he would use the money, she
obtained a home-equity loan for $37,647 against her condominium in January 2018 (GE 3),
and wired around $37,000 to him. (GE 2; Tr. 24.)
Applicant began to suspect that something was amiss because the impostor refused
to send her a “selfie;” however, she continued to send him money and gift cards. (Tr. 19.)
Between  October  21,  2017,  and  December  29,  2017,  Applicant  conducted  15  wire
transfers totaling $10,716 that were sent to addresses in the United States and abroad.
Between November 10, 2017, and January 6, 2018, she made 28 money transfers totaling
$22,414 in amounts ranging from $400 to $1,000 to nine different people in the United
States and abroad. She made purchases of $9,184 between November  21, 2017, and
November 30, 2017; $13,270 between December 1, 2017, and December 19, 2017; and
$5,260 between January 1, 2018, and January 28, 2018, which she indicates were all for
ITunes gift cards for the impostor. She used the credit-card account in SOR ¶ 1.a for 27
purchases totaling $10,638, and obtained three cash advances totaling $2,205 between
November 24, 2017, and January 8, 2018. (GE 2.)
When  the  balances on  the  credit cards reached  their  credit limits (were “maxed
out”), the impostor stopped paying on them and refused to make any further payments.
Applicant could not afford to pay them, and so she defaulted on the accounts. (Tr. 31.) The
delinquency histories of the accounts in the SOR follow.

The   impostor  threatened   to   make   no   further payments  on   the   maxed-out  credit
cards  unless  she   continued   to   wire   money   and   procure  ITunes  cards  for him.  (GE  2.)
Sometime  in June  2018, he  called  her  using  an  application.  She  recognized  immediately  by
the sound  of  his voice that it was not the  actor and  that she  had  been  scammed. (Tr. 19-
20.) She  reported  the  scam  online  to  the  Federal Bureau  of  Investigation  (FBI) (GE 2), but
she  never heard back from  the  FBI. (AE  A; Tr. 43.)  Through  a  legal plan  at work, Applicant
has had  an  attorney  working  for her since  2019  to get her debts forgiven because of the
scam. As of  June  2022, the  creditors in the  SOR were holding  her legally  liable for the
debts. (Tr. 26.)
On December 8, 2019, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86) in application for a DOD security clearance. In response to a financial
record inquiry concerning whether she was currently seeking assistance to resolve financial
difficulties, Applicant reported that she was a victim of a scam and owed credit-card debt,
so she had retained an attorney to contact her creditors and attempt to resolve her debts.
In response to SF 86 queries about any routine financial delinquencies, Applicant disclosed
that she owed about $100,000 in a home-equity loan and credit-card debts, and stated,
“The scammer/impostor forced me to use credit cards and he promised to pay them off
and obviously did not. I was a victim.” (GE 1.)
On  March 6, 2020, Applicant was interviewed  by  an  authorized  investigator for the
Office  of   Personnel  Management  (OPM).  She   provided   details  about  the   delinquent
accounts  on   her  credit  record,  including   those   incurred   because   of   the   scam.  She
explained  that she  could not afford to  repay  them, and  that should her attorney  have  little
success in having  her debts forgiven, she  might have  to  file  for bankruptcy. Applicant did
not dispute  the  evidence  of  her wire  transfers and  purchases to  U.S. and  international
addresses, which she  indicated  were at the  impostor’s request.  She  described  her overall
financial situation  as stressful and  admitted  that she  made  a  mistake  in acceding  to  the
scammer’s demands. She  maintained  she  would not again fall  for a  scam. She  indicated
that her lawyer, a  character reference  listed  on her SF 86, her supervisor,  and some co-
workers, are aware that she  fell  for a  scam. (GE 2.) The  extent of  their  knowledge  is not in
evidence.
Applicant has no savings but has about $80,000 in a 401(k) account. (Tr. 34.) She
has not considered using any of that retirement asset to settle any of the SOR debts. (Tr.
35.) She lives from paycheck to paycheck, has to budget expenses, and sometimes goes
weeks without buying food. (Tr. 34.) She has been current in making her monthly payment,
presently at $411 per month, on the home-equity loan that she obtained to provide money
and gift cards to the impostor. (GE 3; Tr. 32.) She leases a 2020 model-year vehicle at a
cost of $356 per month. (Tr. 33.)
Applicant told the impostor where she works but no details about her work. (Tr. 36.)
She has not had any disciplinary issues at work. (AEs A-C.) An engineering manager at
work attests that Applicant has been fully professional, very loyal, dependable, honest, and
hardworking. She is considered a valuable team member within their department. (AE B.)
The manager for whom she worked directly from 2014 to at least December 2021 attests to
the diligence with which Applicant fulfills her job duties. He described her as a strong asset
to their employer. (AE C.) Likewise, an engineer in the department, who has known her for
about eight years, indicates that Applicant is conscientious and dedicated to her job. She is
willing to stay late to ensure that an important task is completed. He indicates that she
does not often make mistakes, but when they happen, she is the first to point it out and
rectify it. (AE D.) Their character reference letters make no mention of Applicant having
financial problems or having been caught up in a scam.
Applicant regrets disclosing her personal information to the impostor. She no longer
communicates with anyone she does not know, including by messaging or social media
applications. (AE A; Tr. 43.)
