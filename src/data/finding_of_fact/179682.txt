In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c-
1.g, and 1.j. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.h, and 1.i. His admissions are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  41-year-old  help-desk  representative  employed  by  defense
contractors  since  November  2016.  He  was  hired  by  his  current  employer  in  February
2022. (Tr. 12.) He held non-federal jobs as a mail clerk from May 2005 to December 2010,
a  part-time  recruiter  for  a  college  from  July  2013  to  November  2016,  and  a  site
representative for a major corporation from August 2013 until November 2016, when he
was hired by a defense contractor. (GX 1 at 13-17.) His SCA does not reflect whether he
was employed between December 2010 and July 2013. He has never married and has
no children.
Applicant earned about $12 per hour and worked 40 hours per week from August
2013 to November 2016. His pay increased to about $23 per hour when he began working
for defense contractors. (Tr. 27-29.).
Applicant attended college from August 1999 to May 2004, January to May 2006,
and  August  2015  to  October  2016.  He  did  not  receive  a  degree,  but  he  received  a
certificate as a dental assistant in in November 2016. (GX 1 at 11-12; AX D.) He recently
completed an online course and received a certificate in workplace diversity and inclusion.
(Tr. 26.)
Applicant served in the U.S. Air Force Reserve (USAFR) from December 2010 to
January 2016 and received an honorable discharge. He was a senior airman (pay grade
E-4), serving as an aircraft crew chief. He received a security clearance in February 2012.
The document notifying him that his application for a clearance was granted cautioned
him about the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts and failure to fully disclose
the debts in his SCA. (GX 5.)
Applicant underwent surgery for a brain tumor in December 2019 and was unable
to work until early February 2020. (Tr. 32.) His pay was reduced to about 30% to 40% of
his full pay while he was on medical leave. (Tr. 19, 32.) In his most recent resume, he
stated that he was able to return to work without limitations and perform at the same high
level as he did before his surgery. (AX B.)
The  SOR  alleges  two  delinquent  student  loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.j),  five
delinquent medical debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.g), and three consumer debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.h,
and 1.i). The delinquent debts are reflected in credit reports from December 2020, June
2021, and April 2022. (GX 2, 3, and 4.) The evidence concerning the debts is summarized
below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: student loan placed for collection of $62,237. This loan first became
delinquent in November 2017 (GX 3 at 3.) Payments on this loan were about $350 per
month. Collection of this loan was deferred until August  31, 2022. Applicant made two
payments on the debt that were returned to him because of the deferment. (AX H; Tr. 16.)
SOR ¶ 1.b: credit-card account placed for collection of $791.  This debt first
became delinquent in September 2015, and it was charged off in December 2020. (GX 3
at 2). He made a payment on this debt after he was interviewed by a security investigator
in February 2021. (GX 6 at 4.) It was paid in full in April 2022. (AX G; Tr. 17-18.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.g: medical debts for $809, $349, $273, $225, and $348, totaling
$2,004, placed for collection by the same collection agency. Applicant testified that
these medical debts were incurred in December 2019, when he underwent surgery for a
brain tumor. (AX A.) His surgery was covered by his medical insurance, and the amounts
alleged  in  the  SOR  are  copayments.  (Tr.  44.)  They  were  referred  for  collection  in
December 2020. (GX 2 at 3.) He was making payments on his medical debts when he
was interviewed by a security investigator in February 2021. (GX 6 at 3.) He is now paying
$30-$40 per month to the collection agency.  One of the debts has been paid and four
debts remain delinquent. (AX I; Tr. 19-20, 40.)
SOR ¶ 1.h: telecommunication service bill placed for collection of $406. This
debt was incurred for failure to return equipment. It was placed for collection in November
2020. (GX 2 at 3.) Applicant paid it in full shortly after he was interviewed by a security
investigator in February 2021. (GX 6 at 3; Tr. 21, 39.)
SOR  ¶  1.i:  credit-union  debt  placed  for  collection  of  $499.  This  debt  was
charged off in February 2018. (GX 2 at 5.) Applicant told a security investigator that he
paid it in 2018. (GX 6 at 2.) However, the evidence he submitted at the hearing reflects
that he did not pay it in full until June 2022. (AX C; Tr. 39.)
SOR ¶ 1.j: student loan placed for collection of $24,370. This student loan was
transferred to the same creditor as the loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. (AX J.) It first became
delinquent in June 2015. (GX 3 at 3.) Payments on this loan are deferred until August 31,
2022.
On June 10, 2022, the Friday before the hearing on June 14, 2022, following the
advice of his attorney, Applicant completed three on-line financial management classes.
(AX M; Tr. 42.) He completed a personal income and expense analysis reflecting total
monthly income of $4,483 and expenses of $3,719. He lives in a rental property and owns
a car that is fully paid for. He has budgeted $375 per month for student loans once the
deferment ends. (AX L.)
Applicant’s  neighbor  has  known  him  for  about  18  months  and  considers  him  a
caring and reliable friend, and he trusted Applicant to take care of his apartment during a
two-month absence. (AX F at 1.) A technical sergeant in the  USAFR regards him as a
mentor “who continues to be a voice of reason when I am needing clarity.” (AX F at 2.) A
friend  for  20  years  considers  him  dependable,  responsible,  honest,  courteous  and
“adored and respected by many.” (AX F at 3.) A Navy lieutenant who has known Applicant
for 15 years describes him as dependable, responsible, honest, and courteous. (AX K.)
