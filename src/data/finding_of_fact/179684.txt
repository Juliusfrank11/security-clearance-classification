Applicant  denied  the  SOR  allegations.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a federal contractor performing the duties
of a chief systems engineer. He began working at his present job in November 2016. He
earned his bachelor’s degree in 2008 (attending from 2004-2008), his master’s degree in
2010 (attending from 2008-2010), and his doctorate (Ph.D.) in 2016 (attending from 2011
to 2016). He used student loans  to finance all of his higher education. The loans were
serviced  by  both  the  Department  of  Education  (DOE)  and  a  private  loan  servicing
corporation (PL). He is divorced. He has seven children, including two former stepchildren
and reported that he provides financial assistance to the younger two children. He served
in the Air National Guard from 2009 to 2017 when he was honorably discharged. (Tr. 6,
21-22, 24-26, 40; GE 1, 3)
The  SOR  alleged  eight  delinquent  DOE  student  loans  totaling  approximately
$98,042.  The  debts  are  established  by  a  credit  report  from  September  2020  and
Applicant’s personal subject interview (PSI) with a background investigator in November-
December 2020, including documents provided by Applicant to the investigator after his
interview. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.h) (GE 2-3)
Applicant’s student loan history is somewhat confusing. The SOR only alleged that
his DOE loans were in collection status and therefore delinquent. A November 30, 2020
letter from a loan servicing company corroborates that the same eight DOE student loans
listed in the SOR were the loans Applicant sought to rehabilitate. An August 9, 2021 letter
to  Applicant  from  DOE  indicated  that  the  same  eight  student  loans  were  successfully
rehabilitated.  As  for  the  student  loans  serviced  by  the  PL,  correspondence  to  the
Applicant from the PL indicated that 11 student loans (with different  loan numbers and
amounts  due  versus  his  DOE  loans)  were  placed  into  a  “forbearance”  status  for
nonpayment  on  November  25,  2020.  (Since  these  delinquent  student  loans  were  not
alleged  in  the  SOR,  I  will  not  consider  them  for  disqualification  purposes,  but  I  may
consider them in determining the applicability of any mitigating conditions and in making
assessments using the whole-person factors.) (GE 2, see attached thereto  documents
labeled  “Attachment  1,  Item  003,  Page  3,  4,  8,  9  of  9”;  Answer  to  SOR  attachment
thereto).
Applicant testified that his undergraduate student loans were deferred during his
military  service.  During  his  background  interview,  he  stated  that  he  never  made  any
payments toward his PL student loans before or after his military service. While Applicant
was trying to work with the PL servicer, COVID hit and subsequently through Presidential
action, all federal student-loan payments were automatically deferred. Applicant believes
that  the  PL  student  loans have  been  consolidated  with  the  DOE  student  loans.  Applicant’s
most recent credit report  (April 2022)  still  shows the  PL  student loans as separate  from
the  DOE  loans, however, the  status listed  for each  of  the  PL  loans indicates “Pays account
as agreed” as of March 2022. (Tr. at 22-23; GE 2 (PSI p. 3))
During his testimony, Applicant claimed that earlier in April 2022 he made his first
payment of $289, under what he believed was the total consolidation of all his student
loans, including both from DOE and the PL. I asked Applicant to provide documentation
of  this  payment  and  documentation  showing  the  latest  payment  agreement  he  had
concerning his student loans. Applicant responded with a post-hearing email dated May
20, 2022. (See AE A1-A25) Listed in Applicant’s email as an item attached thereto was a
document he called “Proof  of payment  toward Student Loan.” However, the  supporting
documentation does not show the April student-loan payment of $289 he referenced in
his hearing testimony. Moreover, none of the documents comprising AE A1- A25 show
any  agreements  toward  paying  his  student  loans,  or  any  actual  payments  toward  his
student  loans. What the  documentation  shows  is that  Applicant  entered an  agreement
with  a  commercial  service  to  submit  requests  on  his  behalf  seeking  student  loan
consolidation  or  requests  for  repayment  plans.  The  agreement  called  for  Applicant  to
make monthly payments of $248 from April 2022 through September 2022, followed by
monthly payments of $39 from October 2022 to March 2023. These payments are called
“document  preparation  services  and  fees”  of  this  company  and  do  not  go  toward  any
student-loan  payments.  (AE  A8)  One  of  the  documents  (AE  A15)  is  a  request  for
additional  forbearance  and  a  request  to  stop  making  payments  because  of  “financial
difficulties.” None of these documents, or any other documentation in the record, show
payments toward Applicant’s DOE or Pl student loans. The documents show that his total
student-loan debt is greater than $160,000. (AE A 24) (AE A1-A25)
Applicant  provided  spreadsheets  for  April  and  May  2022,  listing  his  monthly
expenses for each month. It is not a budget because it does not track his income against
his expenses. Both months show expenses of $248, which he labels as “school loan,” but
which is for the payment of the document preparation services for the commercial service.
There  are  no  other  entries  for  student-loan  payments.  The  spreadsheet  also  shows
Applicant is making minimal monthly payments on 12 credit cards. The combined balance
on  those  cards  is approximately $34,000.  An  earlier budget from November 2020  that
Applicant submitted during his background interview, shows that he was operating at a
monthly deficit after paying all his expenses for the month. (GE 2, see attached thereto
documents labeled “Attachment 1, Item 002, Page 1 of 5”; AE B1-B2)
Applicant  provided letters from two  coworkers in  support of  Applicant  seeking a
leadership  position  in  a  local  civic  organization.  They  described  Applicant  as  honest,
forthcoming, dependable, and responsible. (AE C1-C2)
