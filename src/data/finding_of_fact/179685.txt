Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  employee  of  a  Department  of  Defense  contractor
seeking  a  security  clearance.  She  was  born  in  another  country  and  immigrated  to  the
United States in 1998 at the age of 13. She became a US citizen in 2004. She attended
a for-profit technical institute between  2005  to  2009, earning  a  bachelor’s degree. She
has never served in the U.S. military. She is single and has no children.  (Tr. 10, 24, 32;
Gov  1)  The  names  of  individuals,  businesses,  and  institutions  have  been  changed  in

Guideline F, Financial  Considerations:
Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-
QIP)  on  October  1,  2020.  Under  Section  26  –  Financial  Record  of  the  e-QIP,  she
indicated  that  she  may  be  delinquent  on  Federal  student  loans  on  her  credit  reports.
She indicated that her Federal student loans were being reviewed for forgiveness as a
result  of  the  technical  institute’s false  promises  of  future  employment  after graduation.
She estimated the total amount of her student loans was $45,000. She listed no other
delinquent debts or financial issues. (Gov 1 at 34-35)
Applicant’s  security  clearance  background  investigation  revealed  the  following
delinquent  debts:  four  delinquent  student  loans  placed  for  collection  owed  to  the
Department  of  Education  in  the  amounts  of  $10,876;  $8,385;  $3,073;  and  $532;  an
approximate total of $22,866. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.d: Gov 1 at 34-35; Gov 3 at 5-6; Gov 4 at
2; Gov 5 at 1-2; Gov 6 at 5-6).  Four additional student loans were also alleged in the
amounts  of  $10,531;  $7,019;  $4,823;  and  $3,587;  an  approximate  total  of  $25,960.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h: Gov 1 at 34-35; Gov 2; Gov 3 at 5-6)
Applicant admitted all of the debts. She took out these student loans to pay for
the  technical  institute  she  attended  from  2005  to  2009.  She  chose  to  attend  the
technical  institute  because  of  their  promises  of  future  employment  upon  graduation.
Upon her graduation, she could not find a well-paying job relative to her degree. During
college,  she  worked  part-time  in  a  department  store.  She  continued  to  work  at  the
department store after graduation until she could find a better paying position. Applicant
took more classes on software testing to qualify for better paying jobs. In 2013, she was
hired  as  a  test  engineer  for  a  commercial  technical  company.  She  worked  for  the
company until 2015 when her current employer, a defense contractor, hired her. Both of
these jobs were unrelated to the field she was trained for at the technical  institute. (Tr.
22; Response to SOR; Gov 1 at 34-35; Gov 2)
After  her  graduation  from  the  technical  institute,  Applicant’s  student  loans
became  due  in  2010.  Her  payments  were  between  $500  to  $800  a  month.  She  made
payments for close to a year. She applied for a forbearance in 2011, because of her low
income from working at  the department store  and having to  pay out-of-pocket medical
costs because she had no health insurance. She applied for and received an extension
of  the forbearance every six months through October 2020. In October 2020, she was
told that she could no longer apply for forbearance. (Tr. 34-38; Gov 2)
In  2019, Applicant learned  that a  lawsuit was  filed  against  the  technical  institute
based   on   their   false   promises  of   post-graduate   employment.  A   judgment   was  entered
against   the   technical   institute.  Applicant  was  advised   to   apply   for  her  loans   to   be
discharged   under  the   borrower  defense   to   repayment  rules,  34   C.F.R  §   685.206(c)   or
§685.22. She  applied  for a  discharge  on  July  12, 2021.  (AE  O)  On  March 24,  2022, the
Department   of   Education   approved   her  claim   for  discharge   of   payment   of   her  federal
student loans.  This appears to  be related  to  student loan  debts alleged  in SOR ¶¶  1.a  –
1.d.  (Tr. 37; AE  A)
After  the  discharge,  she  had  four  remaining  federal  subsidized  student  loans  in
default,  an  approximate  balance  of  $22,954.  Sometime  after  March  2022,  Applicant
submitted a  request for reconsideration to  request  the  discharge  of  the  remaining four
loans. She hopes to have a decision from the Department of Education by August 2022.
She has no other delinquent debts. If  her request for reconsideration is denied,  she is
prepared  to  enter  into  a  payment  agreement  on  her  remaining  student  loans.  Her
current monthly income is $4,100. She has over $86,000 in savings and over $36,800 in
her  retirement  account.  She  is  capable  of  making  payments  towards  the  remaining
student loans if they do not qualify for discharge. (Tr. 21, 28-30, 40; AE I; AE A; AE B;
AE C; AE D)
Applicant  earned  approximately  $65,000  a  year  when  she  worked  for  her  first
technical company between 2013-2015. Her current employer hired her in 2015 at the
starting  annual  salary  of  $52,000.  She  was  promoted  in  2019  and  currently  earns
$75,000, annually. In 2011, Applicant and her mother moved in with her sister and her
husband to save expenses. She does not pay rent, but she helps out with groceries and
running errands. In 2015, Applicant needed a car. Her sister bought a car for her in the
amount of $16,000. Applicant paid her sister $1,000 a month until the car was paid off in
2017.  Applicant  encountered  health  issues  between  2017  to  2019.  She  paid
approximately  $11,084  for  treatments  that  were  not  covered  by  insurance.  (Tr.  28-35,
40; AE J; AE K; AE L; AE M)
Whole-Person Factors:
Mr.  G.,  Applicant’s  brother-in-law,  wrote  a  letter  on  Applicant’s  behalf.  He  has
known  Applicant  for  16  years.  He  states  Applicant  is  responsible  and  of  great  moral
character. He states Applicant immigrated to the United States from her home country
to escape religious persecution. Despite coming to the U.S. with significant educational
and  personal  impediments,  Applicant  worked  hard  to  establish  herself  in  the  United
States. She  worked  a near-minimum-wage  job  during  college  and for several years after
graduation.   She   received   a   degree   from   the   technical  institute  that   defrauded   her.  Mr.
G.  and   his  wife   have   been   advocates  for  Applicant   over  10   years.  They   invited   her  to
leave  her apartment  and  move  in  with  them  in  order to  allow  her to  attain  more  financial
stability   and   to   recover  from   the   reality   that  her  degree   was  “empty”  or  “contained   no
value” on  the  open  market. He states Applicant is financially  secure.  He works  with  her
to  insure she  is contributing  to  her savings account  and  retirement  account.  (Tr. 44;  AE
E)
Mr. G. states that they have spoken with the staff of Applicant’s technical institute
on numerous occasions over the years and sought legal guidance on how to deal with
her “empty’ degree.” When  claims against  the  technical  institute began to gain traction
and  Applicant  received  letters  to  participate  in  lawsuits,  they  determined  delaying
payments was in the Applicant’s best interests, especially with the eventual  guilty pleas
of the technical institute. He  states Applicant’s loans are being forgiven. As a  one-time
holder  of  a  security  clearance;  former  contractor  of  a  government  agency;  and  former
employee with Navy, he has no doubt Applicant will continue to be a significant asset to
the U.S. Government. (AE E)
Applicant’s managers think highly of  her. In various feedbacks during her tenure
at  her  current  employer,  she  has  been  described  as  “a  true  team  player”  She  is
dedicated to helping others. People on her team rely on her for advice and knowledge-
sharing. Applicant is “the go to person” on her team. She is “a huge asset . . . and is a
rock star.” (AE M)
