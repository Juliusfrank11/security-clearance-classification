The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file, as required, federal (SOR ¶ 1.a) and
state (SOR ¶ 1.b) income tax returns for  tax years 2014 through 2019, and that, as of
November 2021, he owed delinquent federal taxes of $24,294 (SOR ¶ 1.c) and state taxes
of $4,553 (SOR ¶ 1.d) for tax years 2014 through 2020. When Applicant responded to the
SOR, he admitted that he failed to file his tax returns by the tax deadlines and that he owed
delinquent federal income taxes. He denied that he had any outstanding state taxes as he
had satisfied his state tax debt. He indicated that he has taken full responsibility for the
mistakes  he  made  and  that  he  is current on a monthly payment plan with the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) for his federal taxes.
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact:
Applicant is a 54-year-old self-employed master plumber. He has worked for himself
since  July  2006  and  handles  all  the  paperwork  for  his  business.  (Tr.  16-17.)  He  has
accepted an offer of employment with a defense contractor contingent on him obtaining a
DOD security clearance. (Tr. 16-19.) He briefly taught plumbing at a vocational technical
high school from August to September 2014 but did not enjoy teaching. (GE 1.) He was
married from July 1990 to October 2000 and has two sons, ages 31 and 29. He and his
current girlfriend have been cohabiting since August 2007, except for a brief breakup. (GE
1; Tr. 45.)
Struggling with the paperwork for his business and seeking a change, Applicant
applied  for  employment  with  a  defense  contractor.  (Tr.  15-18.)  On  April  7,  2021,  he
completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He had not previously
held a DOD security clearance. In response to an SF 86 inquiry into whether, in the last
seven years, he had failed to file returns or pay federal, state, or other taxes required by
law, Applicant disclosed that he failed to file federal and state income tax returns for tax
years 2014 through 2019 “due to a broken computer,” but he retained the services of an
accountant in November 2020 and filed all of his delinquent tax returns. He admitted owing
some federal and state income taxes totaling $1,752 (federal only) for tax year (TY) 2014;
$13,585 (federal $11,791 and state $1,794) for TY 2015; $9,015 (federal $8,028 and state
$987)  for  TY  2016;  $13,943  ($11,826  federal  and  $2,117  state)  for  TY  2017;  $9,877
($8,405 federal and $1,472 state) for TY 2018; and $11,052 ($9,462 federal and $1,590
state) for 2019. He reported that he was on a payment plan with the state but still arranging
for repayment of his federal taxes with the IRS. (GE 1.)
On June 7, 2021, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He explained that he was paying $748 per month
toward his outstanding state tax debts, currently totaling $7,030, but was in the process of
setting up a repayment plan with the IRS for $57,652 in outstanding federal income taxes.
He volunteered that he had not yet paid $6,388 in federal income taxes and $633 in state
income  taxes  for tax year 2020.  He  explained  about  his tax filing and tax delinquency
issues that the computer that contained the financial information for his plumbing business
had a malfunction in 2014. When it came time to prepare the income tax returns for his
self-employment as a plumber for TY 2014, he did not have the information needed to
complete his federal and state income tax returns. He continued to neglect his tax filing
and tax payment obligations for subsequent tax years. He denied any intention to evade
taxes and explained that he was in the process of refinancing his mortgage to pay his back
taxes with the equity on his home. (GE 2.)
Applicant knew that he should rectify his tax issues, but he felt overwhelmed by all
the paperwork that would be required to file his delinquent returns and was “scared of the
ramifications” for not filing, so he “let it go.” The IRS never sent him any notices inquiring
about his unfiled returns, although he feared that he would receive a notice from the IRS.
(Tr. 43.) He and his girlfriend discussed his failure to file, and eventually the pressure he
felt adversely affected his relationship with his cohabitant girlfriend to where she decided
on her own  in November 2020  to take steps to address his tax issues. They restarted
QuickBooks and re-enter all the information for the previous six years, and she took his
paperwork to his accountant on her own. (Tr. 17-19, 30-32, 43-45.) Applicant had used this
accountant to file his taxes for tax years prior to 2014. (Tr. 31.) During the six consecutive
years that he disregarded his known obligation to file returns, he did not set aside any
money for taxes. (Tr. 38.)
In response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant indicated on September 29, 2021,
that he was currently working with the state and the IRS to satisfy his back taxes and
penalties. He related that he submitted a large lump-sum payment to the IRS and was in
repayment plans with both the state and the IRS. (GE 2.) In response to a request from
DOHA for details about his tax payments, Applicant explained that he obtained $38,000
from his mother and made lump-sum payments to the IRS of $21,045; $12,313; $3,195;
$2,100;  and  $76.  He  provided  documentation  showing  a  deposit  of  $38,000  into  his
checking account on July 27, 2021; payments of $21,045 and $12,313 to the IRS on July
28, 2021; and an installment agreement with the IRS requiring him to pay $965 per month
starting November 1, 2021. For the state taxes, he submitted evidence of his $748 monthly
payments between April 15, 2021, and September 7, 2021. He estimated that his state
taxes would be paid off within the next five months. (GE 3.) Applicant obtained the $38,000
from his mother because he had to make a large lump-sum payment to the IRS before he
could get on a repayment plan for his delinquent federal income taxes. His tax returns had
been filed, but the IRS was threatening to file a lien on his house. (Tr. 21, 46.)
A current payment record from the IRS shows that Applicant made a payment of
$2,100 to the IRS on August 26, 2021, and monthly payments of $965 from November
2021 through June 2022. All of these tax payments were applied to his tax liability for TY
2016. Additionally, he made a $8,899 payment on April 30, 2022, with his return for TY
2021. (AE A.) He obtained the funds for that payment from an old retirement account that
he had for about 20 years that he had not contributed to. (Tr. 37.) He testified that his state
tax liability was settled on his final payment of approximately $2,500, which was a reduced
balance from the amount remaining. (Tr. 20, 35.) He estimates that he owes about $43,000
to $44,000 in federal income taxes as of June 2022. (Tr. 20-21.)
Applicant  understands  that  he  made  a  “poor  choice”  in  failing  to  timely  file  his
income tax returns and pay his taxes. (Tr. 15, 29.) He is able to meet his current financial
obligations, although he does not have any savings and has been taking on extra jobs to
ensure that he has the funds to make his federal income tax payments. He has checking
deposits totaling $5,000. (Tr. 39-41.) His cohabitant girlfriend contributes to the household
income.  (Tr.  26.)  Applicant’s  monthly  expenses  include  $1,700  for  his  mortgage  loan
(balance $167,000); $250 for cable services; $500 for a van loan (balance $10,000); $100
for electricity; and an average of $100 for heating. (Tr. 22-23.) His home is currently valued
at $420,000. He intends to refinance the mortgage on his home or obtain a home-equity
loan to give him the funds to pay off his federal income tax debts. (Tr. 23, 41.) He tried to
refinance  last  year  but  his  income  was  not  enough  to  qualify  for  the  loan.  (Tr.  39.)  If
granted  a  security  clearance,  he  will  earn  about  $25.50  an  hour  with  the  defense
contractor. (Tr. 24.) In May 2022, Applicant learned that there are open positions for which
he may be qualified that do not require a security clearance. He has not pursued any of
those opportunities while a decision on his security clearance eligibility is pending. (Tr. 29.)
Character Reference
A close friend of Applicant’s for about 30 years testified that Applicant is reputed
among their community to be of strong character, a hard worker, and always willing to help
others. This friend, who works as a federal probation officer, became aware of Applicant’s
tax  issues  when  Applicant  applied  to  work  for  the  defense  contractor  as  he  helped
Applicant with his application for employment. They had discussed taxes previously over
the  years,  but  primarily  it  was  about  the  challenges  Applicant  had  with  managing  his
records as a small business owner. This friend does not consider Applicant a security risk
as Applicant is working hard to rectify his tax situation. (Tr. 50-56.)
