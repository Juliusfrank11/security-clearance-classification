Applicant admitted all six allegations contained in the SOR with explanations. (Item
2)
Applicant is 36 years old and has been married since 2006. They have two minor
children. After graduating from high school in 2003, he enlisted in the Marine Corps and
served  until  2008,  when  he  received  an  Honorable  discharge.  He  has  earned  some
college credits. He began working for a defense contractor in April 2015. (Item 3)
In April 2020, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations
Processing (e-QIP). (Item 3) Applicant was interviewed in October 2020 by a government
investigator. During that background interview, Applicant discussed his delinquent debts.
He said his financial problems started in 2015 when his father was diagnosed with cancer
and his brother needed financial assistance, and he began supporting them. He told the
investigator that he intended to resolve his delinquent debts in the future when he had
enough money. (Item 4)
Based  on  Applicantâ€™s  admissions  and  credit  bureau  reports  (CBR)  from  August
2020,  and  January  2022,  the  SOR  alleged  five  student  loans  in  collections,  totaling
$23,711, and two car loans in collections totaling $26,753. He acknowledged that he has
not made any payments on his student loans since obtaining them between 2008 and
2009. In 2015 and 2017, he took out car loans. (Items 4, 5, and 6) In his Answer, Applicant
stated that he contacted all of his creditors in an attempt to settle and resolve the debts,
but has  been  unable to  do  so  because  they requested  large  settlement  payments.  He
asserted that he only had one unresolved car loan and that the SOR alleged a duplicate
car  loan.  According  to  the  August  2020  CBR,  those  two  debts  have  different  account
numbers and appear to be unrelated. After receiving the FORM in February 2022, he did
not submit evidence documenting that he made any payments on the alleged debts, or
that the two alleged car loans debts are the same debt.
Applicant did not submit a written budget, listing his current monthly income and
expenses or financial status. He did not present evidence that he participated in credit or
budget counseling.
