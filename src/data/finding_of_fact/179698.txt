In Applicant’s SOR response, he  denied the SOR allegation in ¶ 1.a. (HE 3) He
also provided mitigating information.
Applicant is a 54-year-old systems engineer who has been employed by a DOD
contractor in the area of information technology for several years. (Tr. 20-21) In 2006, he
married, and his three children are 9, 10, and 12. (Tr. 20) He attended college, and he
did  not  receive  a  degree.  (Tr.  21)  He  has  not  served  in  the  military.  (Tr.  21)  His
exceptionally detailed resume provides additional information about his background and
training. (AE BB (pg. 461-471)) The summary indicates:
A   hands-on   computer   consultant/manager  and   critical  thinking   that  can

Financial Considerations
In  January  2014, Applicant’s net monthly  pay  was about $10,000. (AE  EE  (pg. 486-
487))  Later in 2014, Applicant his net monthly  pay  was about $18,000. (AE  GG  (pg. 510))
He had  a  brief  period  of unemployment in 2014. From  late  2014  to  March  2017, his  annual
salary was about $100,000. (Tr. 59-62, 64; AE  HH  (pg. 513)) In  2018, Applicant’s annual
$145,000.  (Tr. 49) His spouse
salary  was $170,000. (Tr. 52) His current annual salary is
did not  work outside  their  home  from  2015  to  2021. (Tr. 50)  He  spends  about  $11,000
annually to support his autistic child. (Tr. 57)
SOR  ¶   1.a   alleges  a   charged-off   account  for  $71,997.  In   2006,  Applicant
purchased   his  residence   for  $387,000   with   financing   his  builder  provided.  (Tr.   24)   His
home’s  purchase   was  financed   with   two   loans  from   the   same   mortgage   lender   (C1),
primary  mortgage  account XX35  and  secondary  mortgage  account XX77. (Tr. 24-25; HE
3)  Lender C1  sold  the  two  loans to  Lender A. He made  two  separate  payments  to  the
lenders  for the two mortgages. (Tr. 32)
Applicant’s  November  14,  2006   mortgage   agreement  indicates   the   primary
mortgage  amount was  $311,500, the  annual interest  rate  was  8.5  percent,  the  loan  period
was  30  years, and  the  monthly  payment  was $2,284.  (pg. 279) His credit report  states he
had  a  $290,643  conventional mortgage  (XX35), opened  in  2006, modified  in 2014, and
closed  in  May  2021, and  it was in a  “[p]ays account  as agreed” status in 2021. (GE 6  at
6)  An   April  29,  2009   bill  from   Lender  A   for  first  mortgage   account   XX35   indicates  the
balance   was   $309,214   with   a   monthly   payment  is  $2,398.  (AE   L   (pg.  103-104))  From
January   2015   to   October  2015,  Applicant  made   the   $2,686   monthly   payments  on   his
primary  mortgage  account  (XX35), although  some  of the  payments were made  15  to  30
days late. (AE  X) This  account was transferred  or sold to  another mortgage  company,
Lender C2,  and  then  to  Lender Q,  on  May  21, 2021. (GE  6  at  5) Applicant  currently  has
a  $299,873  FHA  mortgage  with  an  $1,835  monthly  payment. (GE  6  at 5) The  Lender Q
mortgage   is in  a   “[p]ays  account  as  agreed”   status.  (Tr. 35; GE   6  at  5)  The   Lender Q
annual interest  rate  is 2.9  percent.  (Tr. 36) Applicant’s  handling  of the  XX35  mortgage
account does not raise  a  security  concern;  however, the  relationship between  the  primary
mortgage XX35 with the secondary mortgage  XX77  will be briefly discussed,  infra.
In  2006, Applicant also  borrowed  $77,822  at an  11.25  percent annual  interest  rate
from Lender C,  and  his  contract  specified  monthly  payments  of $756. (AE K  (pg. 75-76);
AE  Y  (pg. 295-297)) An  April 29, 2009  bill from  Lender A  for second  mortgage  account
XX77  indicates the  balance  was  $77,071  with  a  monthly  payment is $756.  (AE  L  (pg. 105-
106))
Around 2014 to 2015, Applicant changed employment, and he received less pay.
(Tr. 26-27) He also had a period of unemployment. (AE EE (pg. 478)) He called mortgage
lender  A,  and  he  asked  for  better  loan  terms.  (Tr.  28)  He  stopped  paying  his  two
mortgages.  (Tr.  27-28)  Lender  A  provided  loan  modification  documentation;  however,
Applicant  had  difficulty  completing  the  application  and  providing  all  of  the  supporting
documentation,  which  was  extensive.  (Tr.  28-30)  In  April  2014,  Applicant  submitted
documentation to modify both of the mortgages. (Tr. 34; AE EE (pg. 478-482)) The two
loan numbers were written on the bottom of the loan modification request. (Id.) After three
or four months, a mortgage modification was approved. (Tr. 30-31)
The  new  loan  modification  agreement states it “amends and  supplements (1) the
Mortgage, Deed  of  Trust,  or Deed  to  Secure Debt (the  ‘Security  Instrument’), dated  the
14  day  of  November, 2006  and  in the  amount of  $311,500.00.”  (Tr. 39; AE  K  (pg. 91); AE
M  (pg. 109)  The  new  principal balance  was $304,764. (AE  K  (pg. 93; AE  M  (pg.  111))
Applicant insisted  that he believed  two mortgages for about  $310,000 and  $70,000  were
merged  into  one  mortgage  for about $311,000. (Tr. 40) Applicant successfully  completed
the   three-month   trial  period,   and   he   said  he   received   payment   instructions  for  one
mortgage. (Tr. 31-32)
Applicant’s July 1, 2015 Lender A statement for account XX77 shows he paid $756
the previous month and $844 in the year to date. (AE P (pg. 163)) His August 1, 2015
Lender A statement for account XX77 shows he paid $756 the previous month and $1,600
year to date. (AE Q (pg. 170)) On August 19, 2015, the Lender A wrote Applicant that his
new  principal  balance  of  the  second  mortgage  was  $79,389,  which  included  unpaid
interest of $7,391. (AE X (pg. 225-226) Interest was added to his principal balance. (Id.)
His new monthly payment was $1,339, and the first payment was due on September 1,
2015. (Id.) His September 1, 2015 Lender A statement for account XX77 shows he paid
$756 the previous month and $2,356 year to date. (AE R (pg. 177)) He did not make any
additional payments to Lender A for account XX77 after August 2015, and the payment
for the year to date remained at $2,356 for the remainder of 2015. (AE V (pg. 205))
Lender A noted that correspondence was sent to Applicant on the following dates
after  the  August  1,  2015  trial  period:  November  23,  2015;  December  29,  2015;  and
September 5, 2017. (HE 3 at 9) Applicant denied that there were two loan modifications
submitted, and he denied there was a trial period which consisted of monthly trial payment
in the amount of $756.37, beginning June 1, 2015, through August 1, 2015.  (Tr. 42)
The following exchange occurred between Department Counsel and Applicant:
[Department  Counsel]:   I'm  looking  at  a  letter  dated  August  19,  2015,  for
account  number  [XX]77,  and  it's  talking  about  a  principal  balance  of
$79,000. Are you telling me that your first mortgage was only $79,000?
[Applicant]:  No.  I'm  saying  that  the  mortgage  that  I  paid  on  was  the  first
mortgage, which was a much larger sum.
[Department  Counsel]:   Right,  but  in  2015  you  did  a  trial  plan  to  get  your
second mortgage back on track.
[Applicant]:  No,  I  didn't,  because  there  was  only  one  loan  modification
application that I submitted. If there were two mortgage applications, then I
would say, okay, there would be a separate statement for  that, but I only
submitted one application.
[Department  Counsel]:  What  if  you  did  a  loan  modification  on  the  first
mortgage and then you also did this trial plan to fix your second mortgage?
Do you think that's possibly what happened?
[Applicant]:  I  don't  think  so.  I  only   had   one   payment  stub   coming   from
[Lender A]  as one payment.
[Department Counsel]: So  let's  see. So  in  2015, though, you  were receiving
separate statements just for your second  mortgage, weren’t you?
[Applicant]:  Before  the  mortgage  modification  was  occurring,  yes,  I  was
receiving two separate statements, two separate mortgage accounts, two
separate  amounts.  After  the  mortgage  modification  submission  went
through, [Lender A] was only sending one mortgage statement to me at my
address, actually in a certified overnight letter, so they were very diligently
Fed Ex'ing these trial statements to my home [address omitted]. So the trial
itself to them was very important. And as I said, they were sending FedEx
mail overnight to make sure that those payments were made on time, and I
sent them as well. (Tr. 42-43)
Applicant provided payment records from Lender A, which showed that Applicant
paid  $2,686  to  address  his  XX35  debt  11  out  of  12  months  from  December  2014  to
December 2015. (AE X (pg. 247-248))
Applicant received multiple bills from Lender A. (AE N-AE W  (pg. 149-209)) For
example,  on  December  16,  2015,  Lender  A  wrote  Applicant  and  advised  him  that  his
regular monthly payment was $756; he owed $5,964 in interest payments for the period
before June 1, 2015; and he accumulated $12,279 in overdue interest payments for the
period up to January 1, 2016. (AE V (pg. 205, 209)
Applicant said   he  responded  to  Lender A’s requests for payments,   indicating   he
believed  the  $79,000  second  mortgage  was included  in the  loan  modification  in  2014. (Tr.
34)  In   2017,  Applicant   complained   to   the   state   attorney   and   Consumer  Credit  Bureau
about Lender A’s attempts  to  receive  payment for the  $72,000  mortgage. (Tr. 63) Lender
A  received  correspondence  about loans XX35  and  XX77  from  Applicant on  August 16,
2017, and  September 3, 2017. (HE  3  at 6) On  September 15, 2017,  Lender A  provided  a
detailed   history   of   the   two   loans,  including   supporting   documentation.  (Id.)  Lender  A
responded to  Applicant’s complaints as follows:
Our  records   indicate   on   May   14,  2015,   the   loan   ending   in   [XX77]  was
approved   for  an   Extension   Program  Trial  Period   Plan.  The   trial   period
consisted   of   monthly   trial  payment  in  the   amount  of   $756.37,  beginning
June  1, 2015, through  August 1, 2015. My  research  confirms that the  trial
period  plan  was completed, as stated  in enclosed  letter dated  August 19,
2015.  Further research   confirms that   the  extension   agreement  was  to  be
returned   within  fifteen   days.  Our  records  confirm   that  it  was  not  returned
within the  specified  timeframe. I have  enclose[d] copies  of both  letters for
your reference.
[Lender A’s] records  indicate  that  the  loan  ending  in [XX77] was charged  off
and referred to our Recovery Department on  January 19, 2016. At the time
of   the   charge   off,  the   loan   was  paid  through   the   September  2014
installment.   I  have   enclosed   a   copy   of   the   loan   payment  history   for  your
convenience. (HE 3  at 7)
On November 22, 2017, Lender A wrote Applicant asking for payment of $71,998.
(Tr.  43;  AE  AA  (pg.  433))  Lender  A  insisted  that  Applicant  owed  about  $72,000,  and
Applicant maintained the $72,000 was included in the mortgage modification. (Tr. 34, 41)
Applicant said both loans were cited in his single loan modification request, and he was
pleased  when the modification  amount was reduced about $70,000.  (Tr. 44)  Lender A
sold the mortgage account to Lender C2, and Applicant said he continued to receive only
one list of required payments. (Tr. 32)
Applicant disclosed  the  issue  of  his mortgage  in his July  24, 2018  SCA.  He said,
“In  the  year of  2015,  I had  applied  for a  mortgage  modification  using  the  home  affordable
refinance   program.  My   mortgage   was  80/20.  My   income   wasn't   enough.  The   bank
focused  on  the  primary  mortgage  - as to  the  second  mortgage  I had  strongly  assume  it
was being  purged  into  one.” (GE 1  at 57)  The  Office  of  Personnel Management February
28, 2019  summary  of  Applicant’s interview  did not mention  Applicant’s theory  that the  first
and  second  mortgage  were merged  together into  the  mortgage  modification, the  summary
of interview indicates:
The  reason  for the  delinquency was due  to  the  interest  rate  being  11% and
not being  able to  refinance. The  account is currently  being  charged  off. The
Subject  is not aware of when  the  account became delinquent. The  Subject
indicated  that he  no  longer owes anything  due  to  the  account being  in  the
process of  being  charged  off  so  no  further action  will be  taken. (GE 12  at 7)
Applicant’s  October  18,  2019   credit   report  shows  the   debt  in   SOR  ¶   1.a   as
originating  in November 2006,  with  a  balance  of $71,997  (XX77), and  as  a  charged  off
real estate  mortgage  with  date  of last  activity  of  April 2014. (GE  3  at 1) In  2021, the  lien
for the  SOR ¶  1.a  debt was released. (Tr. 46; AE  F (pg. 25)) The  “MORTGAGE  RELEASE,
SATISFACTION, AND  DISCHARGE” document states:
The   undersigned,   [Lender  A],   the   Mortgagee   of  that  certain   Mortgage
described   below,  does  hereby   release,  discharge   and   reconvey,   to   the
persons legally  entitled  thereto, all  of  its right,  title,  and  interest  in and  to  the
real  estate   described   in  said  Mortgage,  forever  satisfying,  releasing,
cancelling, and discharging the lien  from said  Mortgage.  (AE E (pg. 21)
Applicant said he did not know why the lien was released. (Tr. 46) This debt is not shown
on his June 29, 2021, or July 25, 2022 credit reports. (GE 5, GE 6)
Applicant said after the  hearing  he  would provide  documentations showing  that the
two   mortgages  were   included   in   the   same   modification.  (Tr.  63)  He  provided   his
application  for a  loan  modification, which has the  two  loan  numbers handwritten  on  the
bottom   of   the   pages.   (AE   EE   (pg.  478-482))  Both   mortgages  are  listed   in  the   income
portion  of the  application,  and  he  provided  the  homeowner’s insurance  to  Lender A. (AE
EE  (pg. 480); AE  FF (pg. 494-495))  He did not  receive  an  IRS  Form  1099C indicating  the
$72,000   mortgage   was  forgiven.  (Tr.  65)   His  budget  showed   a   current  discretionary
monthly  remainder of $2,492. (AE  DD  (pg. 476))  He did not include  his spouse’s income
of  $3,128  in the  calculation  of  the  remainder; however, she  was not employed  outside
their  home  until recently. (Id.)  Applicant’s credit reports reflect paid debts or debts with  a
zero  balance  or  in  current  paid  as  agreed  status.  The  three  major  credit  reporting
companies score Applicant at 710, 698, and 698. (AE B (pg. 7))
