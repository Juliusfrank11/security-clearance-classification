In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c,
1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.j, with explanations. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.f,
and 1.h. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 44-year-old test engineer employed by a defense contractor since
December 2019.  He served  on active  duty in  the U.S. Army from August 1998 to July
2007  and  was  honorably  discharged  as  a  staff  sergeant.  He  worked  for  federal
contractors from July 2007  to August  2013. He  was  unemployed from  August  2013 to
January 2014. He worked in private sector jobs from January to July 2014. He has worked
for defense contractors from July 2014 to the present.
Applicant received a security clearance in October 2012. His security clearance is
currently suspended, and he is on leave without pay. (AX A.)
Applicant  married  in  September  2002,  and  his  wife  committed  suicide  in
September  2004.  He  remarried  in  July  2007  and  divorced  in  April  2017.  He  has  two
children, ages 23 and 12. He received an associate’s degree in November 2006.
The  SOR  alleges  nine  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $35,000  and  a  home
foreclosure. The  debts  are  reflected  in  credit  reports  from  December  2021,  November
2019,  and  February  2019.  (GX  3,  4,  and  5.)  The  evidence  concerning  these  debts  is
summarized below.
SOR ¶  1.a:  deficiency  after a  vehicle  repossession  charged off  for $18,630.
Applicant has not contacted  this creditor or taken  any  action  to  resolve  the  debt. (Tr. 46-
47.)
SOR ¶ 1.b: delinquent rent payments for an apartment, referred for collection
of $4,456. Applicant testified that he has disputed the amount of this debt with the creditor,
and the dispute has not been resolved. (Tr. 48.) He submitted no documentary evidence
of the basis for the dispute. The debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c: debt to U.S. Government agency placed for collection of $3,379.
This debt arose when Applicant enrolled in a class using his veteran’s benefits, but failed
to  complete  the  class. He  testified  that  the debt  was  partially resolved  by diverting his
federal income tax refunds and is now being collected by deductions from his disability
pay. He believes that the debt has been reduced to about $1,100. (Tr. 50-53.) He did not
provide any documentation showing diversion of his federal entitlements to resolve this
debt or any other efforts to resolve the debt.
SOR ¶ 1.d: credit-card account charged off for $987. Applicant testified that he
had not made any payments on this debt but that it was “cleared,” because it is no longer
reflected on his credit reports. (Tr. 53-54.) It is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.e:  charge  account  charged  off  for  $831.  Applicant  testified  that  this
debt was for a purchase of tires, and he has been making $20 payments since January
2022. He did not provide any documentation of payments. (Tr. 54-55.)
SOR  ¶  1.f:  debt  referred  for  collection  of  $1,221.  Applicant  testified  that  he
disputed this debt with the credit bureau when it first appeared on his credit report in 2019,
and that the dispute is reflected on his credit report. (Tr. 55-56.) The February 2019 credit
report reflects the debt and the dispute. (GX 5 at 12.) The credit reports from November
2019 and December 2021 do not reflect the debt. (GX 3; GX 4.) Because the debt is too
recent  to  have  “aged  off”  the  credit  report,  it  is  likely  that  the  dispute  was  resolved  in
Applicant’s favor.
SOR ¶ 1.g: utility debt referred for collection of $169. Applicant testified that he
paid this debt and that he currently has service with the same provider. (Tr. 57-58.) He
did not provide any documentation of payment or evidence that the account is current.
SOR ¶ 1.h: telecommunications debt referred for collection of $219. Applicant
denied this debt on the ground that he has never had an account with this provider.  He
testified  that  he  disputed  the  debt  with  the  credit  bureau.  (Tr. 58.)  The  February 2019
credit report reflects that the dispute was resolved. (GX 5 at 12.) The debt is not reflected
on the two more recent credit reports. (GX 3; GX 4.) It is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.i: debt charged off for $5,106. Applicant testified that this debt was for
a personal loan, and that it was satisfied when he obtained another loan from the same
lender. (Tr. 56-61.) The February 2019 credit report reflects that this account was closed
when the loan was refinanced, and that the account is current. (GX 5 at 9.) This debt is
resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.j:  home  foreclosure.  Applicant  testified  that  he  fell  behind  on  his
payments while he was unemployed, and he contacted the lender and asked to modify
the  loan  because  of  hardship  or  to  allow  a  short  sale  of  the  property.  (AX  B.)  Both
applications were denied, and the lender advised him and his family to move out of the
house. They moved out in August 2013 and rented an apartment nearby. After about six
months, Applicant drove by the house and noticed a letter on the door, which informed
him that his application to modify the loan was approved. He contacted the lender and
asked for 60 days to modify the loan, because he was required to give  his landlord 60
days of notice to move out. The bank refused to delay the process, and the house was
sold. (Tr. 62-64.) The February 2019 credit report reflects that the loan was foreclosed,
the collateral was sold, and that there is no balance due. (GX 5 at 5.) The debt is resolved.
In  2019,  Applicant  contacted  his  credit  union  for  advice  on  how  to  improve  his
credit rating and better manage his finances. He was able to purchase a home in April
2021. He missed one payment at the beginning of his mortgage, but his payments now
are current. (Tr. 67-70.)
Before  Applicant  was  suspended  without  pay,  his  take-home  pay  was  about
$4,400 per month. He is now receiving $378 per month in unemployment compensation.
His payments on his home mortgage loan are $1,415 per month. He purchased a used
vehicle  in  2019,  and  his  car  payments  are  $641  per  month.  He  pays  child  support  of
$1,400 per month. (Tr. 70-72.) He has about $15,000 in his retirement account. (Tr. 79.)
He has no savings. (Tr. 83.) He receives military disability pay. (Tr. 54.) However, he did
not  submit  any  evidence  of  disability  pay  at  the  hearing  and  did  not  report  it  in  his
application for modification of his previous home mortgage.
A former roommate who lived with Applicant a total of five or six years and who
served  with  Applicant  on  active  duty  testified  that  he  considers  Applicant  an  “honest,
good,  and  responsible  person”  who  paid  his  fair  share  of  their  living  expenses.  The
roommate is employed by a federal contractor and has held a security clearance since
1996. (Tr. 103.) The roommate was not aware of Applicant’s delinquent debts. (Tr. 98.)
A  friend  and  former supervisor from  2017  to  2019  testified  that Applicant was a
dedicated,  reliable, and  trustworthy  worker. (Tr. 108.) He  also  was unaware of Applicant’s
delinquent debts. (Tr.108-110.)
