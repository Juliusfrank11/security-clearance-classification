In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.h
and 1.j-1.m. She denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.i. Her admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  58-year-old  contracts  manager  employed  by  various  defense
contractors from November 2002 to the present. She married in September 1982 and has
two adult children.
Applicant  was  a  federal  employee  from  March  1986  to  December  1993.  She
underwent a security investigation in 2006 and was granted a clearance on a date  not
reflected  in  the  record.  Her  SCA  reflects  that  she  was  cleared  for  access  to  sensitive
compartmented  information  (SCI)  in  December  2011.  (FORM  Item  3  at  45.)  She  was
unemployed  from  November  2016  to  October  2017.  About  three  months  after  she
returned to work in October 2017, her husband lost his job and was unemployed for about
a year, until he found a part-time job.
After a personal subject interview (PSI) with a security investigator in September
2018, Applicant submitted documentation that four delinquent credit-card accounts were
paid or settled; a credit card debt of $2,932 was cancelled in 2014; a delinquent credit-
card debt of $447 was resolved in January 2015; a delinquent credit-card debt of $208
was  resolved  in  March  2016;  and  a  delinquent  dental  bill  for  $1,731  was  resolved  in
October 2016. These debts were incurred, became delinquent, and were resolved before
she became unemployed in November 2016. None of  these debts were alleged in the
SOR.  (FORM  Item  5  at  3,  4,  6-8,  11-14).  I  have  considered  the  evidence  of  these
delinquent debts for the limited purposes of  deciding which adjudicative guidelines are
applicable; evaluating evidence of mitigation, and as part of my whole-person analysis
The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file her federal and state income
tax returns for tax years 2016 through 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.a), that she owes delinquent federal
taxes  of  $10,512  (SOR  ¶  1.b),  and  that  she  owes  delinquent  state  income  taxes  of
$11,648 (SOR ¶ 1.c). The SOR also alleges 11 delinquent consumer debts that are reflect
in credit reports from April 2019, December 2021, and March 2018 (FORM Items 6, 7,
and 11.). The evidence concerning the allegations in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns for tax
years 2016 through 2018. In Applicant’s response to the SOR, she stated that the federal
and state returns for tax years 2016 and 2017 were late because she and her husband
had difficulty obtaining records. She did not provide any explanation of the nature or cause
of their difficulty. Thus, I am unable to determine if her difficulty in obtaining records was
due to disorganization, carelessness, procrastination, or some reason beyond her control.
Her admission establishes the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a that the federal and state returns
for 2016 and 2017 were not timely filed.
Applicant stated that the 2018 return was timely mailed but not received. She did
not submit any evidence of timely mailing. She stated that she and her husband filed the
2018  return  again  in  December  2019  but  have  been  unable  to  document  that  filing,
because the IRS is backlogged with processing returns due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
She stated that she was told by an IRS representative to “be patient.”
SOR ¶ 1.b: federal tax debt of $10,512. Applicant incurred a federal tax debt of
$11,410 for tax year 2014. She attributed the debt to a mistake in her return. She provided
no evidence of the nature of the mistake. She had a payment plan providing for payments
of $160 per month, and she made three payments in 2018 and one in 2019. The payment
plan  was  terminated  because  she  was  late  filing  her  returns  for  2016  and  2017.  Her
refunds of $1,225 for 2016 and $4,348 for 2017 were applied to her tax debt. When she
submitted her SCA in February 2018, she calculated that her refund for 2018 would be
$3,886, which would also be applied to her federal tax debt. In her response to the FORM,
she  provided  documentary  evidence  that  her  current  federal  tax  debt  is  zero.  (FORM
Response,  Exhibit 1.) The  documentary evidence establishes that the federal  tax debt
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b was paid, albeit involuntarily.
SOR  ¶  1.c:  state  tax  debt  of  $11,648.  Applicant  owed  state  taxes  of  $552  for
2016; $1,602 for 2017; and $1,705 for 2018. (FORM Item 4 at 5.) In response to DOHA
interrogatories in January 2020, She stated that she believed that the state tax debt was
due  to  a  mistake  made  by  her  husband’s  employer,  causing  a  school  district  tax
assessment  to  be  paid  to  the  wrong  district.  She  stated  that  she  had  entered  into  a
payment  plan  for  $100  per  month  to  pay  the  tax  debt.  (FORM  Item  4  at  6-8.)  In  her
response to the FORM, she stated that the IRS had rejected their federal return because
someone  else  had  claimed  their  dependents,  that  they  were  required  to  amend  and
resubmit their state return, that the state erroneously estimated that they owed $11,648,
and that they had been paying $500 per month since December 2021. They resubmitted
their 2019 state tax return in March 2022, and the state tax transcript reflects that they
owed $176, not the $11,648 alleged in the SOR. (FORM Response, Exhibit 2.). A state
tax lien that was imposed  on a date not reflected in the record  was released in March
2022. The release recites that the tax debt “has been settled, cancelled- and/or satisfied.”
(FORM Response, Exhibit 3.) The debt is resolved.
SOR  1.d:  home  equity  line  of  credit,  past  due  for  $689  with  a  balance  of
$24,598.  After  a  PSI  with  a  security  investigator  on  September  6,  2018,  Applicant
provided documentation that a past-due balance was paid in full. (FORM Item 5 at 8.) The
April 2019 credit report reflects that the past-due amount alleged in the SOR was incurred
after the PSI and after the account was previously brought up to date. (FORM Item 6 at
2.) In her response to the FORM, Applicant asserted that payments on this account are
current, but she did not provide documentary evidence to support her assertion. (FORM
Response at 2.)
SOR ¶ 1.e: credit-card account charged off for $12,870. After the PSI, Applicant
provided documentation of a $50 payment on September 10, 2018. (FORM Item 5 at 2.)
She  provided  no  evidence  of  any  other  payments.  In  her  response  to  the  FORM,  she
asserted that she was making payments on this debt until it was sold, and that she has
not been able to locate who owns the debt. (FORM Response at 2.) She did not provide
any documentation of the amounts and frequency of her payments after September 2018.
The  fact  that  the  debts  were  charged  off  indicates  that  the  payments  were  less  than
required. She also did not provide any documentary evidence of her efforts to locate the
current holder of the debt. This debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.f: credit-card account charged off for $1,385. After the PSI, Applicant
submitted evidence of a payment of $267 on this debt in May 2014. (FORM Item 5 at 9.)
In response to the FORM, she provided documentary evidence that, as of October 22,
2021, she was making monthly $300 payments by automatic withdrawals from her bank
account. (FORM Response, Exhibit 4.) This debt is being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.g: medical bill for $946. In Applicant’s response to the FORM, she stated
that she had been trying for two years to resolve this debt but that the creditor has failed
to submit the claim to her insurance provider. She did not provide any documentation of
her  efforts  to  resolve  the  debt,  nor  did  she  explain  why  she  has  not  contacted  her
insurance provider directly. The debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶  1.h:  credit-card account  past due  for $185  with a  balance  of  $900.  In
Applicant’s  response   to   the   FORM,  she   submitted   evidence   of   monthly   $50   payments
totaling  $800  on  a  debt of  $972. (FORM  Response, Exhibit 5.) The  debt is being  resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.i:  unsecured  loan  placed  for  collection  of  $645.  In  Applicant’s
response to the FORM, she submitted evidence that she settled this debt for $128.95.
(FORM Response at Exhibit 6.) The debt is resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.j:  veterinarian bill  placed for  collection of $495.  Applicant  disputed
this  bill on  the  ground  that  the  veterinarian  did  not  properly  treat her  dog,  causing  the
dog’s  death.  In  her  response  to  the  FORM,  she  stated  that  the  veterinarian  agreed  to
cancel the bill. She provided no evidence to support her dispute and no evidence that the
debt was cancelled. The debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.k:  charge  account  placed  for  collection  of  $288.  In  Applicant’s
response to the FORM, she stated that she paid this debt “years ago,” but could not find
her documentation. It is not resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.l and 1.m: installment account charged off for $1,824, and line of
credit  charged  off  for  $1,418.  Both  debts  were  charged  off  in  March  2016.  In  the
September 2018 PSI, Applicant stated that both debts were satisfied. (FORM Item 4 at
13.)  She  provided  no  documentary  evidence  showing  that  they  were  satisfied.  In  her
answer to the FORM, she admitted these debts but stated that she has been unable to
find the current owners of the debts. She provided no documentary evidence of contact
with the original creditors or her efforts to locate the current owners. She has not disputed
the debts with any of the credit bureaus. The debts are not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.n: telecommunications bill placed for collection of $239.  Applicant
did  not  respond  to  this  allegation  in  her  answer  to  the  SOR.  She  admitted  it  in  her
response to the FORM, asserting that the debt was paid in full. However, she provided
no documentation to support her assertion.
Applicant  attributed  her  financial  problems  to  unexpectedly  being  laid  off  in
November  2016,  after  earning  about  $110,000  annually,  and  her  husband’s  loss  of
employment for more than a year, followed by his underemployment for a year and a half.
She provided no explanation for the delinquent debts that were incurred before she was
laid off. Her SCA reflects that she and her husband took a vacation trip outside the United
States in April 2017, after she was laid off. (FORM Item 3 at 37-38.)
Federal income tax transcripts reflect joint adjusted gross income of $241,412 for
tax year 2014; $198,930 for 2015; $191,577 for 2016; and $118,878 for 2017. (FORM
Item 4 at 19-25.) Applicant has not provided any information regarding her current income
or expenses. She told an investigator that she had hired a debt-consolidation service in
the  spring  of  2016  but  terminated  her  contract  because  the  service  did  not  make  any
payments to her creditors.
