Financial Considerations
The SOR lists six allegations under this concern, the first two deal with his failure
to  file  his  Federal  and  state  income  tax  returns,  and  the  remaining  four  deal  with
collection accounts, all of which are discussed in further detail below. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.f)
These  allegations  are  established  by  his  July  22,  2019  SF-86; his  Office of  Personnel
Management  (OPM)  Report  of  Investigation  (ROI)  conducted  from  October  16  to  29,
2019, to include summarized results of Applicant’s Personal Subject Interviews (PSI) on
October  4,  2019  and  October  29,  2019;  his  September  14,  2019  and  November  27,
2020  credit  reports;  and  his  June  5,  2020,  SOR  Response.  (GE  1  through  5;  SOR
Answer)
Applicant’s financial difficulties began in  2009 when his business partner and vice
president  of   his  former  business   suddenly  departed   leaving   him   responsible   for  all
operations  and   company   debt.   His  company   lost   a   major  contract   that   was  eventually
replaced   by   a  much   less   profitable   contract.  Applicant  estimates   this  business   loss
caused  his  salary  to  be  reduced  from  “about  120  (thousand  dollars a  year)” to  “around
80   (thousand   dollars   a   year).  This  unplanned   income   loss   placed   Applicant  in  a
precarious financial position,  “it was either pay  rent and  bills or . . . not doing   anything
else.” Added  to  that,  Applicant’s state  of residence  began  garnishing  his wages for non-
payment of state taxes. (Tr. 34-36)
In  his  SOR  Answer,  Applicant’s  explanation  for  not  filing  his  Federal  and  state
income  tax  returns  from  2012  to  2018  was,  “This  situation  occurred  due  to  me  owing
taxes and being unable to pay them at the time. I let the time lapse and eventually fell in
to being paranoid and afraid to reach out to the IRS and [state tax authority] to pay the
taxes  and  bring  my  returns  up  to  date.  I  realize  that  was  not  the  correct  response.”
(SOR Answer) He added during his hearing, “So, that initially is just because I just kept
getting scared because I had that initial tax burden and it  just left me  in  paralysis.” (Tr.
36-37)  Going  forward,  Applicant  stated  that  he  intends  to  file  his  taxes  in  a  timely
manner. (Tr. 39)
SOR ¶ 1.a: Failed to file Federal income tax returns for tax years 2012, 2013,

signatures. (AE H, AE P through AE T) In his SOR Answer, Applicant attached his 2018
(alleged)  and  2019  (not  alleged)  Federal  income  returns.  These  two  returns  do  not
reflect filing dates or signatures. (SOR Answer) Applicant submitted documentation that
he had made a $7,679 payment to the IRS on May 20, 2021, and a $2,381 payment to

completed  state  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2012,  2013,  2014,  2015,  and  2016.

SOR  Answer,  Applicant  attached  his  2018  (alleged)  and  2019  (not  alleged)  state
income  returns.  These  two  returns  do  not  reflect  filing  dates  or  signatures.  (SOR
Answer)
Applicant  was  alerted  to  the  Government’s  concerns  regarding  his failure  to  file
his  Federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  during  his  October  4,  2019  OPM  PSI.
Applicant  stated  that  he  was  “scared  to  file  taxes  and  face  the  amount  that  has
accumulated  over  the  years  and  did  not  have  the  means  to  pay  them.”  His  state  tax
authority  began  garnishing  his  wages  in  2018  for  $20,000  in  back  taxes  owed  to  the
state. During that interview, Applicant stated that he was unsure of the amount he owed
for  his  Federal  and  state  back  income  taxes.  Applicant  added  that  he  understood  the
importance of filing and paying his taxes. He stated that he was currently in the process
of  contacting  a  tax  assistance  group  to  handle  his  outstanding  debt  with  the  IRS  and
state  tax  authority.  Applicant  was  also  alerted  to  the  Government’s  concern  regarding
his failure to file his Federal and state tax income tax returns when he received his April
10, 2020 SOR. (Tr. 49-50; GE 2) At his hearing, Applicant stated that he was working
on  filing  his  Federal  and  state  income  tax  returns,  adding  that  all  of  his  income  tax
returns from 2017 to 2021 had been filed. (Tr. 50-52)

(SOR Answer; Tr. 42-43; AE D) DEBT RESOLVED.

acknowledged  purchasing  this  recreational  vehicle  even  though  he  had  not  filed  his
income tax returns. Contacted creditor and settled account for $18,515 on June 3, 2020.
(SOR Answer; Tr. 44-47; AE C) DEBT RESOLVED.

Character Evidence
Applicant stated that he takes security “very seriously” and is not a security risk.
In  that  regard,  he  submitted  numerous  certificates  documenting  security  training  he
completed.  (Tr. 43-44; AE N,  AE V) He  submitted a  detailed  letter of  recommendation
from  a  client command  recognizing  his “outstanding  support and  technical innovation.”
(Tr. 44; AE K)
The  president  of  Applicant’s  current  employer  testified  on  his  behalf.  She  has
held a  security clearance  since 2000. Applicant worked for her  company from 2004 to
2009  and  was  rehired  in  2017.  The  company  president  provided  favorable  testimony
regarding  his  work  performance,  character,  and  contribution  to  the  national  defense.
She  is  aware  of  his  tax  and  financial  problems.  She  is  also  familiar  with  how  those
problems evolved and what he is doing to resolve them. In short, she does not believe
that he is a security risk. Applicant’s company president also provided a reference letter
that was submitted with his SOR Answer consistent with  her testimony. (SOR Answer;
Tr.  11-20)  The  officer  in  charge  of  a  client  command  also  provided  a  reference  letter
that lauded Applicant’s character and performance. (SOR Answer)
Applicant’s  2020  and  2021  employee  evaluations
reflect  his  superior
performance. The  write-ups  describe  in further detail his trustworthiness  and his value
to the company. (AE J) Applicant also submitted recent photographs of his two children.
