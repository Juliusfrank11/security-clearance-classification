Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has
worked since April 2017. He worked for another government contractor from December
2009 until he began his current employment. He earned a high school diploma in 2000
and an associate’s degree in 2008. He has been married since 2016. Applicant has one
child who is four years old. (Transcript (Tr.) 31-32, 39-40; Applicant’s response to SOR;

The  SOR alleges  Applicant’s 15  delinquent  debts totaling  approximately  $53,000.
These   delinquencies   consist  of   personal  loans,  credit  cards,   student  loans,  and   a   car
loan.  Approximately   $30,000   of  the   delinquent  debt  in   the   SOR  is  for  student   loans.
Applicant admitted  all  of  the  SOR allegations with  additional comment. His  admissions
are adopted  as findings of  fact.  (Tr.  19-77; Applicant’s response  to  SOR; GE  1-7;  AE  A-

Applicant  attributed   his  financial  issues  to   several  causes.   He  admitted   that,
earlier  in  his  life,   he   was  immature  about   his  financial  responsibilities  and   ignored   his
debts.  He also knowingly  spent beyond  his means.  For example, he  took out a  $10,000
loan  to pay  for his wedding  which he  later defaulted  on.  He  also borrowed  $1,200 for his
son’s baptism  despite  being  delinquent  on  other financial  obligations.  Applicant  was in a
car accident in April 2017  that  totaled  his car. He  could not afford to  pay  the  difference
between  what was owed  on his car loan  and the  amount he  received  from his insurance
company  for his totaled  car.  In  2017, he  and  his wife  had  a  son  who  had  a  milk allergy,
so  he  had  to  spend  extra  money  on  special formula that his son  could tolerate.  He also
took on  a  substantial amount  of his   wife’s and  his in-law’s debt   that is  not  listed  in  the
SOR, but has  contributed  to his inability  to  cover his expenses.1  Finally, his wife  was not
working   between   about  2015   and   July   2021,  when   she   began   earning   a   modest  and
sporadic  income  of no  more than  $200  per  month.  (Tr.  19-31,  38-40,  48-51,  54, 58-69,
70-74; Applicant’s response  to SOR; GE 1, 6)
Applicant’s  2019  security  interview  with  his  background  investigator  made  him
realize that his security clearance was in jeopardy.  In about July 2019, after beginning
the process to renew his security clearance, and having had his background interview,
Applicant  decided  to  get  his  debts  under  control.  He  and  his  wife  contacted  a  debt
consolidation company (Company A) and entered into an agreement for Company A to
negotiate  payments  with  Applicant’s  and  his  wife’s  creditors  on  their  behalf  (the
Agreement).  The  Agreement  allowed  Applicant  to  pay  money  into  an  account  with
Company  A.  Company  A  would  then  draw  funds  from  his  account  in  order  to  pay
Applicant’s  and  his wife’s  creditors a monthly amount that it had negotiated with them.
Applicant is currently paying Company A about $552 per month under the Agreement.
Applicant and his wife decide  which debts and in what order they want  Company A to
address.  Applicant  has  included  some  of  the  SOR  debts  as  part  of  his  rehabilitation
program  with  Company  A,  but  decided  to  attempt  to  resolve  some  of  the  SOR  debts,
1  Any  adverse information  not alleged in  the SOR, such as  Applicant’s  wife’s  or  in-law’s  delinquent debt,
or his  ability  to  pay  it,  cannot be used for disqualification  purposes. It may  be  considered  when  assessing
the application of mitigating conditions  and for the whole-person analysis.
such  as  his  delinquent  Federal  student  loans,  outside  of  the  Company  A  program.
Applicant and his wife have also included with Company A, non SOR debts that belong
to  Applicant’s  wife  and  his  in-laws.  Out  of  a  sense  of  moral  (not  legal)  obligation,
Applicant  agreed  to  pay  certain  debts  that  his  wife  and  his  in-laws  had  incurred.  The
SOR debts are in various stages of  resolution. Some have been paid for less than the
full balance, some are in the process of being paid, and some remain unaddressed. As
he  finishes  paying  debts  through  Company  A,  Applicant  has  cycled  in  other  debts  for
Company A to negotiate and pay. His plan is to continue this approach until he is debt
free. His agreement with Company A began in August 2019 and it was to continue for
53 months. He has provided documents to show that he has paid down or has settled
some debts for less  than  the full  amount.  Applicant  has  not  prioritized  negotiating and
paying  his  SOR  debts  through  Company  A  over  his  wife’s  and  his  in-law’s  debts.  (Tr.

The $1,786 credit card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a is being resolved by payments
through Company A. Applicant has 25 remaining monthly payments to make out of 47
total. If he continues to make his payments as scheduled, he will have settled this debt
through  payments  of  $864  in  total  by  the  end  of  July  2024.  (Tr.  20-22,  33,  36;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-6; AE A, G)
The delinquent debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, 1.i, 1.m, and 1.n. have been settled
by Applicant paying less than the full balance to creditors. With the exception of the debt
in SOR ¶ 1.m, which he negotiated and paid on his own, Applicant made his payments
to these creditors through Company A. (Tr. 22-29, 36-37; Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 1-6; AE A, G, H)
The  $1,886  credit  card  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.d  was  settled  and  paid  for  an
amount less than the full balance in June 2022. (Tr.  23; Applicant’s response  to  SOR;
GE 1-6; AE C, G)
The $7,040 car loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e has not been resolved. This debt was
incurred  in  the  aforementioned  instance  when  Applicant’s  insurance  payment  on  his
totaled vehicle did not cover the full amount of his auto loan. The latest activity date for
this debt on any of the credit reports is December 2017. Applicant has not entered into
payment  arrangements  with  respect  to  this debt,  but  plans  to  pay  it  when  he  receives
his  anticipated  2022  income  tax  refund  sometime  in  2023.  (Tr.  23,  44;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1-6; AE G)
The $3,283 personal loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g has not been resolved. Applicant
incurred  this  debt  in  about  2016  in  order  to  pay  for  landscaping  at  his  residence.  The
December 2019 credit report reflects a last payment date of September 2018. Applicant
has not entered into payment arrangements with respect to this debt, but plans to add it
to the list of debts that Company A will resolve on his behalf in November 2022. (Tr. 25-
26, 44-46, 71; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-6; AE A, G)
The $2,142 personal loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h has not been resolved. Applicant
incurred this debt to pay for his son’s baptism  (although he also testified the loan was
used for Christmas gifts). The December 2019 credit report reflects a last payment date
of  March  2019.  Applicant  has  not  entered  into  payment  arrangements  with  respect  to
this debt, but plans to add it to the list of debts that Company A will resolve on his behalf
in late August 2022. He plans on making a down payment on his debt in August 2022.

The  student  loans  for  $17,246  and  $13,265  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.j  and  1.k,
respectively,  have  not  been  resolved.  While  these  student  loans  are  currently  in  a
deferred status as of March 2020 as a result of the pandemic, the latest last activity date
listed  on  a  credit  report  is  February  2019.  The  December  2019  credit  report  shows  a
first delinquency date of February 2017. Applicant acknowledged making only a couple
of  payments  on  these  debts  after  they  first  became  due  in  2008  or  2009,  and  then
repeatedly  requested  forbearance  because  he  could  afford  to  pay  them.  He  plans  to
contact his student loan servicer in September 2022 in order to begin making payments
and  to  seek  student  loan  forgiveness.  (Tr.  26,  40-44,  55,  57;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 1-6; AE G)
The  $1,072  credit  card  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.l  has  not  been  resolved.
Applicant  has  not  entered  into  payment  arrangements  with  respect  to  this  debt,  but
plans  to  add  it  to  the  list  of  debts  that  Company  A  will  resolve  on  his  behalf  in  late
August 2022. Applicant incurred this debt for day-to-day expenses. The December 2019
credit  report  reflects  a  last  payment  date  of  September  2018.  (Tr.  46;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1-6; AE A, G)
The $774 credit card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.o has not been resolved. Applicant
has not entered into payment arrangements with respect to this debt, but plans to add it
to  the  list  of  debts  that  Company  A  will  resolve  on  his  behalf  in  early  August  2022.
Applicant  incurred  this  debt  for  daily  expenses.  The  December  2019  credit  report
reflects a last payment date of February 2017. (Tr. 29, 47; Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 1, 4; AE G)
Applicant  submitted  earnings  statements  from  his  employer  for  the  June  1
through June 15, 2022 pay period, as well as the  June 16 through June 30, 2022 pay
period.  Applicant’s  hourly  pay  is  $29.58.  Both  of  these  earnings  statements  reflect
significant overtime, which substantially increased Applicant’s earnings. For the first pay
period  in  June  2022,  Applicant  worked  15.5  hours  of  overtime.  For  the  second  pay
period in June 2022, he worked 22.5 hours of overtime. His take home income for the
June 2022  pay periods  was  $3,152  and $3,304, respectively.  The number of  overtime
hours he normally works per pay period has not been established, but Applicant testified
that  he  makes  about  $53,000  annually  without  overtime  and  between  $70,000  and
$80,000 annually with overtime. Applicant also submitted a budget worksheet as part of
his  evidence.  In  it,  he  lists  his  and  his  wife’s  monthly  income  as  $7,044.  Applicant’s
take-home  pay  in  June  2022,  as  established  by  his  earnings  statements,  was  $6,456
and  included  significant  overtime.  Applicant’s  wife  contributes  no  more  than  $200  per
month. Therefore, it is unclear how Applicant arrived at the higher figure on his budget
worksheet,  which  detracts  from  its  accuracy.  In  his  budget  worksheet,  Applicant  lists
expenses  of  $3,804  and  a  monthly  surplus  of  $1,640.  He  also  provided  a  bank
statement showing that he has about $63 in his checking account and about $1,209 in
his  savings  account.  He  has  received  some  financial  counseling  through  one  of
Company A’s subsidiaries by watching some online videos. In the Agreement, Company
A  advised  against  incurring  any  additional  debt  while  in  their  program.  After  receiving
the SOR, Applicant has incurred additional debt on two credit cards, but claimed that he
is current on those new credit card accounts. (Tr. 31, 49; Applicant’s response to SOR;
