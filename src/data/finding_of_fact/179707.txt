In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through
1.f, and he denied the SOR allegation in ¶ 1.a. (HE 3) His admissions are accepted as
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 44-year-old aircraft mechanic who has been employed by the same
DOD contractor since 2015. (Tr. 6, 28) In 1996, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 7) He
has  taken  some  college  classes;  however,  he  has  not  received  a  degree.  (Tr.  7)  He
served in the Air Force from 1996 to 2014, and he received early retirement as a technical
sergeant (E-6) under the Government’s Temporary Early Retirement Authority. (Tr. 7, 27)
He received monthly retirement pay and medical benefits. (Tr. 8) He has held a security
clearance  for  seven  years  while  working  for  a  DOD  contractor,  and  there  are  no
allegations of security violations. (Tr. 28)  His resume provides further details about his
employment. (AE Y)
Applicant was married from October 1998 to June 2005. (Tr. 21; GE 1) He was
married the second time from July 2009 to July 2010. (Tr. 21-22; GE 2) His two children
are ages 20 and 21; they are married; and they do not live with him. (Tr. 9, 26)
Financial Considerations
As  a  result  of  his  first  divorce,  Applicant  had  monthly  child-support  payment
responsibilities  of  $1,200,  and  he  was  required  to  pay  about  $900  monthly  for  a  debt
consolidation loan he obtained to pay off marital debts and for other costs. (Tr. 32, 37; AE
E  at  6;  AE  BB)  His  first  wife  was  dishonest  about  opening  credit  card  accounts  in
Applicant’s  name  while  he  was  deployed.  (Tr.  32)  He  eventually  paid  off  the  debt
consolidation loan. (Tr. 37)
From  March 2016  to February 2018, Applicant cohabitated with his girlfriend,  who
had   been   medically   discharged   from   the   Air   Force.   (Tr.  22-23)  She   had   mental-health
issues,  and   she   attempted   suicide.  (Tr.   23) She   was  unemployed.   (Tr.  23)  Applicant’s
finances were harmed  by  his support  for  her. (Tr. 23)  He did  not detail  how  much  he  paid
to assist her.
The August 19, 2020 SOR alleged six delinquent debts totaling $42,165 as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a  alleges  Applicant’s mortgage is past due  in the amount of  $24,443.  On
March  14,  2012,  Applicant  obtained   a  $185,423   mortgage   with   $46,355   repayment
guaranteed   by   the   Department   of   Veterans  Affairs  (VA).  (Tr.  30-31;  AE   A;  AE   B)  This
mortgage   enabled   him   to   purchase   a   house   near  an   Air   Force   Base   where  he   was
assigned. The  home  was newly  constructed, and  the  development where it was located
had  new  homes under construction. (Tr. 36) In  October 2014, the  mortgage  account was
one  month  late  because  of  Applicant’s support for his cohabitant,  who  was an  inpatient
at a  military hospital at  a distant location. (Tr.  34) In  October 2014, Applicant retired  from
the   Air   Force   and   moved   out   of  the   house.   (Tr.   33)   A   friend   moved   into   the   house   in
October 2014,  and  his  friend  paid  rent for several months. (Tr. 33-34) The  $1,300  rent
was  sufficient  to   pay   the   mortgage,  insurance,  and   taxes.  (Tr.  34)  Applicant’s  tenant
advised  him  that  he  was having  financial problems  and  could  not pay  the  rent.  (Tr.  36; AE
N)  Applicant was unable to  sell  the  home  because  new  homes were available at similar
prices, and he could not compete with them. (Tr. 36-37)
In  August  2016,  the  creditor  received  a  judgment  for  $202,226  for  Applicant’s
residence, and the deed for Applicant’s property was transferred to the creditor. (Tr. 68;
AE C) On August 3, 2022, the VA wrote Applicant a letter which stated:
Please   be   advised,  the   property   which  secured   this  loan   was  sold  to   the
noteholder at  foreclosure sale  on  [in  2016]  for $154,315.80.  At  the  time  of
the  foreclosure  sale,  the  total outstanding  loan  balance  was $205,819.72.
The  proceeds from  the  foreclosure sale were applied  to  this balance, as well
as a  claim  under loan  guaranty  from the  Department  of Veterans  Affairs in
the  amount of  $46,805.00, but those  payments were not sufficient to  fully
pay  the  outstanding  balance  resulting  in a  deficiency  balance  of  $4,698.92.
VA  Regulation  38  CFR 36.4324(e) provides upon  payment of a  claim  to  the
lender following  termination  of  the  account,  VA, to  the  extent of guaranty
paid,  has the  right to  establish  and  collect  this debt  against  you.  However,
because   this   was  a   Guaranteed   Indemnity   Fund   Loan   (GIF)   that  was
established  after December 1998, VA  is not pursuing  such  collection.  (AE
R)
On  April 29,  2019, the  VA  indicated  the  amount of  VA loss was $45,931. (AE  B)
The   creditor  refunded   two   months   of  insurance   payments   from   Applicant’s  escrow
account  to  Applicant.  (Tr. 38-39) Applicant’s  mortgage  debt is  resolved. (Tr.  39; AE  M)
He is credited with mitigating this debt.
In 2020, Applicant purchased another house in a different state. (Tr. 54) His current
mortgage is $284,742, and the VA has guaranteed repayment. (Tr. 67; AE D) His monthly
payment for mortgage, taxes, and insurance is $1,715; it is automatically paid from his
bank  account;  and  his  mortgage  account  is  current.  (AE  D)  The  mortgage  company
estimated his home value is $459,000; his equity is $174,258; and he could borrow an
additional $73,258. (AE D) His car loan is paid off. (Tr. 57) His annual net pay is $67,000.
(Tr. 64) He has about $2,000 monthly remaining after all expenses are paid. (Tr. 62)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a charged-off credit-card debt for $8,174. SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a
credit-card debt in collection for $7,158. SOR ¶ 1.d alleges a charged-off credit-card debt
for $1,466. Applicant used these three credit cards for the expenses of daily living, and
he  admitted  his  responsibility  for  the  three  debts.  (Tr.  42,  46,  48;  SOR  response)  On
October 4, 2018, he told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that he
planned to pay these three debts in 2019 or as soon as possible. (Tr. 44; GE 2 at 8-10)
However, after he made this promise to the OPM investigator, he needed funds to assist
his mother and grandmother. (Tr. 44) He also moved twice after his OPM interview. (Tr.
48-49, 54) He did not make any payments to address SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d after his
OPM interview. He did not provide details about his financial assistance to his mother and
grandmother or the additional expenses from moving to different residences.
Applicant currently  has  funds available to  pay  the  debts in SOR ¶¶  1.b, 1.c, and
1.d. He has a  total of  about $20,000  in his checking  and  savings accounts; however, he
did  not   believe   it   was  a   good   idea   to   pay   these   three   debts  before   he   knew   the
ramifications of  paying  them  on  his  pending  security  clearance  disposition. (Tr. 43,  46-
47,  63; AE  L) If  he  used  his  available  funds  to  pay  his  SOR  debts,  and  he  lost  his security
clearance   and   employment,   he   would  be   in   a   financial  hardship   because   the   funds
expended   would  be   unavailable  while   he   was  unemployed.  (Tr.  43,  46,  71)   After  his
hearing,  he   indicated   in  an   email   that  he   would  pay   the   three   delinquent  debts  if   his
security  clearance  is not revoked  with  the  funds that  were already  available to  settle  the
three  debts. (AE J; AE  L)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges an account placed for collection for $151. Applicant owed this
debt for Internet services for about seven years. (Tr. 50-51) He paid this debt on June 14,
2022. (Tr. 52)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a utility account placed for collection for $773. Applicant admitted
responsibility for this debt; it was delinquent for about six years; and he paid it on July 8,
2022. (Tr. 53; AE X)
Applicant has not received formal financial counseling. (Tr. 55) He has received
financial advice over the years on an ad hoc basis. (Tr. 55) On August 1, 2022, his credit
scores from the three primary credit reporting companies were 690, 705, and 712. (AE K)
He has $45,445 in his 401(k) account. (AE Q) He is currently paid $32 an hour. (AE T)
Applicant explained why he did not resolve the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d
as follows:
Like I said, I could have settled the three other debts that are here for any
amount along the way, but I wasn’t sure that I was going to be able to keep
my job if I had done so. So I really wanted to get some guidance from either
the  security  administration  or  somebody  that  had  better  knowledge  than
myself what I really needed to do, and I was more than willing to do  that,
just as I have been my whole career. But no one that I could reach out to
could give me any guidance as far as this goes. I felt like I was just kind of
left out here floundering a little bit, I think. (Tr. 76)
Applicant provided an event timeline in which he said:
Every  attempt  of  mine  to  gain  any  information  about  the  status  of  my
clearance  was  met  with  messages  stating  that  it  was  still  under  review
month after month [since] 2018 and that I should remain prepared for the
worst.  Such  was  the  basis  for  my  decision  to  retain  the  funds  I  had
accumulated to avoid the aforementioned possibility that I would be unable
to financially support myself after a possible termination of my employment
as is what I believe to have been the most responsible decision possible
given the circumstances. (AE V at 13)
After his hearing, Applicant indicated in an email that he recently accrued sufficient
funds to pay the three delinquent debts, and he closed with the following comments:
I  would  further  argue  that  to  expend  these  funds  at  any  time  since  the
government  originally  expressed  its  possible  decision  to  revoke  my
clearance, or during these proceedings, whether to clear these debts or for
any  other  reason  would  have  actually  represented  precisely  the  type  of
decision  making  and  irresponsible  acts  that  I  am  accused  of  and  under
review for in the first place. I maintain that I did not act in bad faith to my
creditors in the first place, and I do not intend to do so now. It has also been
explained to me more than once that my paying off these debts at any time
after my interview would not have necessarily secured my retention of my
clearance,  which  further  supports  my  risk  assessment  and  decision  to
ensure that I do not place myself in any further financial peril should I lose
my employment as a result of this evaluation.  I have had to live under these
incredibly  stressful  circumstances  since  these  debts  occurred,  and  have
carried  their  weight  through  numerous  setbacks  to  reach  my  current
improved financial state and do not intend to let anything put me back in
position again.  I find myself in the position to have built up my finances only
to be possibly set back to start over after all of the work I have had to put
forth  to  regain  any  sort  of  financial  comfortability  after  my  experienced
setback surrounding 2014.
I would again ask all reviewing these proceedings to observe my 25 years
of credit history and honorable and decorated military service to recognize
these events were not indicative of my overall judgement, or reliability and
that had it not been for the hardships including the lack of rental payments
for  the  home  I  had  to  leave  behind  in  [specific  state  omitted]  to  gain
employment after retiring from active duty, I would have been quite capable
of  continuing  to  pay  my  debts  as  required  as  I  had  throughout  my  entire
adult life before, and in the years since this isolated incident.  After all, many
years  of  this  service  were  completed  as  a  single  person  managing  all
finances independently without any spouse or agent to monitor my finances
while I was deployed in various hostile areas of operation away from access
to any type of communications that would allow me to access my accounts
during  those  deployments.  I  would  also  note  that  all  of  the  credit  card
accounts  in  question  were  opened  up  to  10  years  prior  to  the  issues  I
experienced and they had always been paid and up to date prior to this time
period as evident by the maturity of the accounts. (see government exhibit
credit report for dates accounts were established) (AE J)
Character Evidence
Three of Applicant’s friends and coworkers and his supervisor provided character
statements.  (AE  F;  AE  G;  AE  I;  AE  O)  The  general  sense  of  their  statements  is  that
Applicant is dedicated, loyal, diligent, honest, trustworthy, and professional. He adhered
to the “Air Force core values Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We
Do.” (AE G) Their statements support his continued access to classified information. He
has also received annual pay increases. (AE T)
Applicant was deployed 11 times and completed numerous training courses during
his  Air  Force  career.  (Tr.  73;  AE  H)  He  received  the  following  Air  Force  (AF)  awards:
Meritorious  Service  Medal;  AF  Commendation  Medal  with  2  oak  leaf  clusters;  AF
Achievement Medal; Joint Meritorious Unit Award; Meritorious Unit Award with 3 oak leaf
clusters; AF Outstanding Unit Award with Valor Device with 7 oak leaf clusters; AF Good

Ribbon with 1 oak leaf cluster; Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon with 1 service
star;  AF  Training  Ribbon;  and  NATO  Medal.  (AE  H)  The  description  of  actions  in  his
August 20, 2003 AF Achievement Medal indicates he was dedicated to his duties, and he
made important contributions to the combat mission in Iraq. (AE H)
Applicant  received  treatment  for  anxiety  and  depression  issues  that  “developed
over the years of repeated and long-term deployments.”  (AE U) He believed his mental-
health  issues  were  due  to his  exposure  to  operations  and  environments  during his Air
Force career, especially when he was in Special Operations. (Id.) After retiring from the
Air Force he was able to end his use of prescribed medications to treat his anxiety and
depression through alternative treatments and resiliency development. (Id.)
