The  SOR  alleges  that:  Applicant’s  immediate  family  relatives  are  citizens  and
residents of South  Korea  (SOR 1.a  through 1.c); Applicant’s  extended family members
are  residents  and  citizens  of  South  Korea  (SOR  1.d);  Applicant  assisted  his  cousin,  a
citizen of South Korea, with his business matters (SOR 1.e); and 14  persons (SOR 1.f
through  1.t),  citizens  (not  residents)  of  South  Korea,  are  Applicant’s  friends  holding
positions  in  the  South  Korean  government  or  government-affiliated  organizations.
(emphasis added)
In  his  February  19,  2021  answer  to  the  February  5,  2021  SOR,  Applicant
admitted SOR 1.a through 1.o, 1.q, and 1.t. He denied SOR 1.p, 1.r, and 1.s.
In  his  May  2021  amended  answer  to  the  undated  amended  SOR,  Applicant
changed  several  of  his  original  answers.  He  admitted  SOR  1.a,  1.b,  1.d,  and  1.e.
However,  unlike  his  February  2021  answer,  he  denied  SOR  1.c  (brothers-in-law  and
sister-in-law), stating that “several sisters-in-law have either passed away or are citizens
or  residents  of  the  United  States.”  Though  admitting  1.f  through  1.s,  and  1.q,  he
objected  to  the  terminology  in  each  of  the  allegations  describing  these  persons  as
“friends”  in  the  February  2021  SOR.  He  denied  SOR  1.p,  1.r,  and  1.s.  Unlike  his
February  2021  answer  to  SOR  1.t,  he  denied  SOR  1.t  in  his  May  2021  amended
answer,  claiming  that  the  account  is  in  his  name  and  confirming  (without  supporting
documentation) there is less than $300 in that account. He noted that “we  do not have
any  substantial  interests  in  Korea,  or  in  any  foreign  business…”  (May  2021  answer  to
the SOR)
In  his  May  2021  amended  answer,  Applicant  denied  SOR  1.u,  explaining  his
rights to the annuity and indicating the retirement contributions are too small to create a
conflict  of  interest.  In  his  response  to  SOR  1.v,  Applicant  emphasized  that  he  never
provided any services for any foreign government. In working for previous law firms, he
provided  legal  services  for  firm  clients  located  in  foreign  countries,  and  not  foreign
countries.  He  no  longer  works  for  these  firms.  In  examining  the  record  in  this  case,  I
observed  Applicant’s demeanor as  I  listened  to  his  testimony.  I  found his testimony to
be generally credible. The discrepancies between his testimony and the information that
he  provided  on  the  same  person  during  the  background  investigation  are  reduced  in
significance by the volume and short relationship of most of the contacts (more than 50)
that  Applicant  reported  in  his  October  2017  security  clearance  application  and  his
interrogatory answers in June 2020. See GE 1 and GE 2.
In  1972,  Applicant  was  born  in  the  United  States  to  Korean  parents  who  are
naturalized U.S. citizens, and who have lived in this country for 40 years. He does not
regard  himself  as  a  dual  citizen  of  another  country.  He  has  a  U.S.  passport  and  has
never  been  issued  a  passport  by  another  country;  his  wife  has  a  South  Korean
passport, but as a homemaker she does not travel. He received his bachelor’s degree in
1994  and  his  juris doctor’s degree  in  1997.  He passed two bars in two states and  has
been a practicing attorney for at least 22 years.  He married his wife in June 1999. His
21-year-old  daughter  was  born  in  the  United  States.  His  19-year-old  son  was  born  in
South Korea, but is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Applicant’s family lives in a home that he
purchased in 2007. (GE 1 at 5-10, 18-23 133; Tr. 16, 35-36; February 2021 answer to
SOR)
Applicant  has  practiced  law  as  a  sole  practitioner  since  2014.  From  August
2009  to  December  2013,  he  was  an  attorney  working  for  a  U.S.  law  firm.  From  June
2001 to June 2006 he lived and taught courses in South Korea. From July 2006 to May
2008, and May 2009 to December 2013, he conducted remote lectures from the United
States  while  a  member  of  a  U.S.  law  firm.  Applicant  has  never  been  investigated  or
possessed  a  security  clearance.  The  reason  why  he  is  seeking  eligibility  is  that  he
wants to spend less time traveling and transition to a new job in information technology
(IT) that contributes to the stability of the United States in some fashion. His sponsor is
a  defense  contractor  dedicated  to  research  and  information  systems.  (GE  1  at  11-15,
133-134; GE 2 at 6-9; Tr. 37-38, 72-74)
SOR  1.a  –  Applicant’s  wife  was  born  in  South  Korea  in  1972.  She  is  still
registered as a permanent resident of the United States because she is fearful of taking
the naturalization test. In 1999, she married Applicant in the United States. She became
a  permanent  resident  of  this  country  in  2000  and  began  living  with  Applicant  and
working as a computer art designer in the same year. Next, she found a job as a rater
for a social media company. She discontinued employment in the early 2000s to devote
complete attention to raising their two children. Applicant’s wife intends to remain in the
United States. (GE 1 at 18-20; Tr. 41-43)
SOR 1.b – Applicant’s mother-in-law is 86 years old and a citizen and resident
of  South Korea. His father-in-law passed away in 2013. The mother-in-law is 86  years
old and lives in an assisted living facility which Applicant’s wife’s oldest brother pays for.
Neither Applicant nor his wife  provide financial  assistance  to his mother-in-law.  She  is
retired  from  employment  at  a  Korean  publishing  company.  Applicant  has  not  spoken
with  her for three  or four years. His  wife’s last  communication  with  her was  during  the
winter holidays in 2021, and was sporadic before that time because her mother had her
cell  phone  confiscated.  Applicant’s  wife  has  visited  her  mother  twice  since  2005.  The
mother-in-law has no affiliation with a foreign government or military. (GE 1 at 25-28; Tr.
44-47)
SOR 1.c – Applicant admitted the allegation in his February 2021 answer to the
SOR, but he provided little information about his three brothers-in-law, and two sisters-
in-law. He stated only that he had not communicated with most of them for a long time.
In  his  May  2021  answer,  he  denied  the  allegation,  claiming  that  several  sisters-in-law
had  died  or  become U.S.  citizens.  He  did  not  identify  the  sisters-in-law who  had  died,
and those who were still living.
Applicant’s oldest brother-in-law is a citizen and resident of South Korea. He is
65  years old and  chief  operating officer (CEO)  of  a  South  Korean company.  He  is not
affiliated with any foreign government or military. He pays the costs of the assisted living
facility of  his mother. (SOR  1.b)  His  wife is 60  years old and also a  resident  citizen of
South  Korea.  The  record  does  not  reveal  her  occupation.  Applicant  has  quarterly
contact  with  these  persons  by  phone  and  in  person.  As  noted  above,  he  provided
negligible  additional  information  about  two  of  his  other  two  brothers-in-law  and  two
sisters-in-law. He indicated he has no contact with them because they are not fluent in
the English language and they generally do not correspond. (GE 1 at 30-33; Tr. 47)
SOR 1.d  –  Applicant has two  cousins who  are resident citizens of  South  Korea.
The  first  cousin  is  president  of an  international school of  law  (SOR 1.e) where Applicant
worked  from  2001  through  2006.  The  second  cousin  (unalleged) is  employed  at another
South   Korean   law   school.  Neither   cousin  is   affiliated   with   any   foreign   government   or
military.  Except  for  the   two   cousins  described   above,  all   of  Applicant’s  other  aunts,
uncles,  and  cousins on  his mother’s side  live  in the  United  States.   Reference  D and  E,
U.S.  citizens,  are  first cousins of  Applicant.  (GE  1  at  35-38; Tr.  17-18; Applicant’s May
2021 answer to  the SOR)
Applicant’s wife’s niece, the  daughter of Applicant’s oldest  brother-in-law, is 34
years old,  and  a  citizen  and  resident on  South  Korea. Applicant contacts her when  he  is
visiting  the  country. There is no  information  about her occupation  or her marital status,
but she  is not affiliated  with  a  foreign  government or military. Applicant’s wife’s  31-year-
old niece  is also a  citizen  and  resident of South  Korea. She  works for a  pension  fund,
but  Applicant   does  not  know   if   she   is   connected   to   a   foreign   government   or  military.
Applicant interacts with  them  during  his visits on  special  occasions  to  South  Korea. (GE
1   at  32-35)  Applicant  does   not  know   how   many   cousins  his  wife   has  in  South   Korea,
and  is not close  with  any  of  them. He was fairly  certain that his wife  was not close  with
any of them either. Applicant did not identify any of the cousins.  (Tr. 48-49)
SOR 1.e – In his February 2021 answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he
assisted  his  cousin  (referred  to  in  SOR  1.d  above),  a  resident  citizen  of  South  Korea
and president of an international school of law, with his business matters. Applicant also
taught U.S. law in the English language between 2001 and 2006, and has not provided
teaching assistance since then, but was still providing legal advice until October 2017.
He contacts his cousin on a quarterly basis, by phone, in person, or social media. (GE 1
at 35-38, 108; Tr. 18, 49-50)
Applicant’s  other  cousin  (referenced  above  in  SOR  1.d  and  unalleged),  a
resident  of  South  Korea,  is  a  professor  employed  by  a  South  Korean  law  school.
Applicant  has  never  had  any  business  relationship  with  this  cousin.  Their  contact  with
each  other  occurs  when  they  are  visiting  each  other’s  country.  This  cousin  has  no
affiliation with a foreign government or military. (GE 1 at 35-38; Tr. 49-50)
SOR  1.f  –  In  Applicant’s  February  2021  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  viewed  the
former South Korean prosecutor as an acquaintance  while  in the United States. In his
May 2021 answer, Applicant objected to the former prosecutor described as a “friend” in
the allegation. They met at Applicant’s U.S. church in the same way Applicant met most
of  the  other  persons  listed  in  SOR  1.f  through  1.s.  Applicant’s  last  contact  with  the
individual was  in 2017, five  years ago  at  Applicant’s former church. Applicant believes
the  former  prosecutor  has  returned  to  South  Korea.  (Tr.  50-52;  Applicant’s  May  2021
answer to the SOR)
SOR  1.g  –  Applicant  initially  met  the  South  Korean  citizen  employed  by  the
country’s  communications  commission  while  Applicant  was  employed  at  the  U.S.  law
firm  (2009-2013).  The  firm  arranged  seminars  in  intellectual  property.  This  person,  a
resident  citizen  of  South  Korea,  attended  a  seminar  where  the  two  had  contact.
Applicant  does  not  know  whether  the  communications  commission  is  a  government
entity. He has had no contact with this person since 2014. (Tr. 53-57)
SOR 1.h –  Applicant’s first contact with the South Korean citizen employed by
the  ministry  of  finance  began  in  2010  or  2011  at  Applicant’s  church  when  the  person
was temporarily living in the United States for two years.  Applicant communicates with
this individual whenever he visits South Korea. With their families living two blocks from
one  another  and  having  their  children  attend  the  same  schools  in  their  U.S
neighborhood,  I  find  that  their  relationship  was  more  than  at  an  acquaintance  level,
even  though  the  close  relationship  ended  in  about  2013,  when  Applicant  believes  this
person returned to South Korea. Applicant’s wife has never interacted with  the minister
of finance. Applicant does not know whether the individual still has the government job.
In  October  2017,  Applicant  considered  his  phone  and  face-to-face  contact  with  this
person as quarterly. (GE 1 at 59; Tr. 55-57)
Applicant  has  had  contact  with  a  second  South  Korean  citizen  working  as  a
manager for the South Korean ministry of finance (unalleged). His interaction occurred
between  2014  and  2017,  when  this  person  returned  to  South  Korea.  Applicant  has
never participated in business ventures with this person. (GE 1 at 69-70; Tr. 56-57)
SOR  1.i  –  Applicant’s  relationship  with  the  South  Korean  citizen  employed  by
the ministry of land, infrastructure, and transportation, lasted about the same length of
time as SOR 1.h. Applicant had no further connection to the individual after he returned
to South Korea in 2017. (GE 1 at 59-60; Tr. 57-58)
SOR  1.j  –  In  his  February  2021  answer  that  the  South  Korean  citizen  was
employed  by  the  Korean  intellectual  office.  However,  in  his  May  2021  answer,  he
claimed  without  explanation,  that  the  South  Korean  citizen  was  an  employee  in  the
Korean  patent  office.  Applicant’s  association  with  the  person  identified  in  SOR  1.j
initially began  at his U.S.  church  and  occurred  in the  same manner as his  association
with  the  persons  described  in  SOR  1.h  and  1.i.  He  described  his  contact  with  this
person occurs annually when one visits the other’s country. (GE 1 at 67-68; Tr. 58)
SOR 1.k – Applicant met the South Korean citizen, an employee of the Korean
ministry  of  foreign  affairs,  at  his  U.S.  church  in  2012  or  2013.  In  2016,  this  person
returned  to  South  Korea.  The  only  occasions  of  additional  contact  occur  sporadically
when  Applicant  is  visiting  Korea.  Applicant  indicated  that  he  had  never  had  financial
contact with this individual. (GE 1 at 73-74; Tr. 58-59)
SOR  1.l  –  Applicant  met  the  South  Korean  citizen,  a  reporter  working  for  a
Korean daily publication, at his U.S. church in 2010. There has been no further contact
with this person since 2011. (GE 1 at 71-72; Tr. 59-60)
SOR. 1.m  –  In about 2012,  a South Korean citizen,  a former major general in
the  country’s  military,  met  at  the  same  U.S.  church  where  Applicant  met  the  previous
South  Koreans,  except  for the  person  identified  at  SOR  1.g.  Applicant  saw the former
major  general  regularly  until  the  former  military  person  returned  to  South  Korea  in
approximately 2017. Applicant does not know whether this person worked in a position
for  the  South  Korean  Embassy.  He  speculated  that  this  individual  was  working  for  a
think tank. (GE 1 at 76-77; Tr. 60-62)
SOR  1.n  –  This  individual,  a  South  Korean  citizen,  served  in  the  Korean  Air
Force  and  currently  works  for  the  Korean  government  defense  acquisition  program.
Applicant apparently met him about 2011 in the U.S. church, and the last time he spoke
with this person was in 2012, with no communication after this person returned to South
Korea in 2017. Based on the number of foreign contacts that Applicant reported in his e-
QIP and his June 2020 interrogatory answers, I find Applicant was mistaken about the
last time he had contact with this individual. (GE 1 at 82-83; GE 2; Tr. 62)
SOR 1.o  –  This individual,  a  citizen  of South  Korea,  worked  for the  ministry  of
information   and   technology.  Applicant   surmised   that  he   remembered   this  person   from
the church, but was not sure. Applicant’s recollection of this individual was hazy.  (Tr. 62-
63)
SOR 1.p – This person, a citizen of South Korea, worked as the South Korean
Ambassador  to  the  United  States.  Applicant  met  him  in  2014  at  the  U.S.  church,  but
could not recall when this person returned to South Korea. Applicant never had financial
dealings or a professional relationship with this person, but knows that he is no longer
the Ambassador. (GE 1 at 115; Tr. 63-64; May 2021 answer to SOR)
SOR  1.q –  This person, a  citizen of  South Korea,  was  employed  as  a military
priest  in  the  country.  After  meeting  at  Applicant’s  U.S.  church,  the  priest  conducted
religious  ceremonies  at  Applicant’s  church.  Applicant  saw  him  weekly  at  church
between  2014  and  2017,  and  sees  him  occasionally  during  his  visits  to  South  Korea.
Applicant  could  not  recall  whether  this  person  was  still  in  the  military.  I  find  that
Applicant  was  mistaken  when  he  testified  seeing  the  priest  only  once  in  South  Korea.
Based  on  the  regularity  of  contacts  in  the  United  States  and  sporadic  interactions  in
South Korea, I find that Applicant’s relationship with the priest was more than simply an
acquaintance. (GE 74-76; Tr. 64-65)
SOR  1.r  –  Friends,  citizens  of  South  Korea,  work  for  the  South  Korean
federation  of  fisheries.  In  both  answers  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denied  the  allegation
because  his  contacts retired  from  the  organization  between  2016 and  2018.  Applicant
explained  that  he  met  them  through  a  client  who  wanted  to  organize  an  office  in  the
United States. His contact with them began in February 2017 and ended in September
of  the  same  year.  Applicant  is  unsure  what  type  of  office  they  wanted  to  establish.
Applicant does not believe the fisheries is an agency of the South Korean government,
but rather a co-operative. (Tr. 65-67)
SOR 1.s – The allegation reads that Applicant’s South Korean friends, who are
citizens  of  the  country,  currently  work  for  a Korean  trade  promotion  agency.  Applicant
denied  this  allegation.  He  met  these  individuals  through  his  church  and  not  through
professional interaction. They were not potential clients. Except for SOR 1.q, Applicant’s
frequency  of  contact  was  minimal  during  the  time  these  listed  individuals  lived  in  the
United States. (Tr. 67-68) See also, Applicant’s May 2021 answer to SOR 1.s.
SOR 1.t – Applicant opened two or three bank accounts in 2001 to deposit his
wages.  The  only  account  still  open  is  described  in  his  October  2017  e-QIP.  Since  he
moved back to the United States in 2006, he has maintained no more than $1,000 in the
South  Korean  account  which  he  uses  to  pay  for  transportation  in  trips  around  the
country. (GE 1 at 101-102; GE 2 at 18; Tr. 68-69)
SOR  1.u  –  Applicant  denied  that  he  will  receive  an  annuity  from  the  South
Korea  university  based  on  his  employment at  the  university  from  2001  to  2006.  In  his
May 2021 answer, he averred that the retirement pension does not show a preference
for South Korea over the United States. He pointed out that the future pension was not
substantial  and  would  not  cause  a  conflict  of  interest.  Applicant  provided  more  focus
about  the  pension  in  his  testimony  asserting  his  right  to  the  money  (less  than  one
percent  of  his  earnings  while  employed  in  South  Korea)  once  he  retires  as  a  U.S.
citizen. (May 2021 answer to the SOR; GE 1 at 20-22; Tr. 24-25, 28-30, 69-71)
SOR 1.v  –  Applicant denied  he served as a consultant,  or that he  provided legal
or intellectual property  services for foreign  countries,  including  South  Korea  and  Japan,
from   2010   to   the   present.   In   his  May   2021   answer  to   the   SOR,  Applicant  stated   that
while employed at previous law firms, he provided legal services for firm clients based in
foreign   countries,  rather  than   foreign   countries.  In   2016,  a   Korean   organization
responsible   for  sponsoring   startups   through   education   and   training,  sponsored   an
American  company  not affiliated  with  the  Korean  government.  The  American  company
hired   Applicant  to   provide   lectures  in  intellectual  property   law   over  a   six-week  period.
Ultimately,  Applicant   was  hired   by   four  Korean   startup   companies  to   do   trademark
registration   for  them,  and   was  paid   on   a   flat  fee   basis   about  $1,000   per  company.
Without explaining  the  basis for his conclusion, he  determined  there was no  conflict of
interest   because   none   of   the   startup   companies  were  controlled   by   the   organization
providing   the   training   and   education   for  the   startup   companies  or  the   Korean
government.  See   GE   1   at  109;  GE   2   at  18-19.   Considering   the   lack  of   evidence
demonstrating   that   Applicant   performed   legal  services  for  a   foreign   country,  I   find   no
potential  conflict  of   interest   to   Applicant’s  potential  security   responsibilities   that  would
increase  the  risk of  a  compromise of  classified  or sensitive  information. Therefore, SOR
1.v is resolved in Applicant’s favor under both the  foreign influence and outside  activities
guidelines.
In  addition  to  his  South  Korean  bank  account  (Tr.  68),  Applicant’s  family  was
eligible  for  medical  benefits  (unalleged)  provided  by  the  Korean  health  care  system
based  on  his  South  Korean  employment  between  2001  and  2006.  Those  medical
benefits expired in December 2018. (GE 1 at 103)
Applicant’s net U.S. earnings for 2019 and 2020 were about $200,000. His U.S.
financial  assets  include  a  home  worth  about $1,000,000,  with  approximately $320,000
remaining  on  the  mortgage.  His  U.S.  checking  and  savings  accounts  total  about
$150,000.  He  has  $80,000  to  $100,000  in  his  retirement  income  accounts.  He  began
accruing  his  bank  and  retirement  accounts  in  1999  when  he  moved  to  the  United
States. Applicant and his wife have two cars. Since he ended his teaching job in 2006,
Applicant has returned to South Korea about every two years for professional reasons,
for conferences and seminars, or to visit family and friends. (GE 1 at 115-130; Tr. 31-40,
45)
Character Evidence
Reference  C  is  an  attorney  with  prior  military  service,  having  served  the  U.S
military for 12 years. Reference C has known Applicant since 2009 and worked with him
on legal matters involving Korean clients. As a practicing attorney, Applicant has always
complying  with  professional  responsibility  rules.  Reference  C  vouches  for  Applicant’s
responsible and trustworthy behavior. (AE C)
Reference  D,  a  U.S.  citizen  by  birth,  is  Applicant’s  first  cousin.  They  have
known one another since early childhood and were roommates in college. Reference D
indicated that he and Applicant have six aunts and uncles living in the United States. No
additional  information  was  provided  identifying  their  residency  status.  According  to
reference  D,  18 of  the children  of  the  six aunts  and  uncles  are  U.S.  citizens  (cousins)
living in the Eastern part of the United States, and most are married. (The description of
the 18 cousins implies that there are remaining cousins who are not U.S citizens, or are
living in a foreign country.) Reference  D considers Applicant a trustworthy person who
demonstrates that he cares about the future of his children. (AE D)
Reference  E,  Applicant’s  first  cousin  and  a  U.S  citizen,  has  known  him  since
childhood. Their mothers are sisters who have lived in a city in the eastern part of the
United States for approximately 40 years. They attended college together. Reference E
lives in the same U.S. county as Applicant and interacts with him at social and sporting
events. (AE E)
Reference  F,  a  U.S.  citizen  and  priest  of  a  U.S.  church,  has  known  Applicant
since 2008 when reference F was the priest of  another U.S. church (Church X) where
Applicant  met  most  of  the  individuals  identified  in  SOR  1f.  through  1.s.  Church  X
conducts religious services in four different languages.
Church  X  had  Korean  members  from  the  Korean  Embassy,  Korean  news
organizations,  and  Korean  companies.  Generally,  these  Korean  members  would  cycle
through the local area for two or three years before returning to Korea. As members of
Church  X,  according  to  the  reference  F,  Applicant  and  his  wife  were  active  in  church
activities,  like  hosting  prayers  and  fundraising.  Applicant  has  established  no  fresh
contacts  with  persons  affiliated  with  the  Korean  government  since  he  applied  for  a
security  clearance.  Based  on  his  dependability  and  integrity,  reference  F  attests  to
Applicant’s security clearance eligibility. (AE F)

Administrative Notice  –  Republic of Korea
The Republic of South Korea is a stable constitutional democracy, governed by
a  president  and  a  unicameral  legislature.  The  country  has  been  close  allies  with  the
United States since 1950. Currently, thousands of U.S. service persons are stationed in
South Korea, and the two countries have periodically conducted military exercises.
Although South Korea has strong bilateral relations with the United States, the
country  has  been  involved  in  multiple  incidents  of  government  espionage  and
intelligence  collection  activities  that  have  resulted  in  U.S  criminal  proceedings.  South
Korea is one of the most active countries involved in industrial espionage directed at the
United States.
The South Korean Government generally respects human rights and the rule of
law.  Though  persistent  problems  with  discrimination  against  women,  persons  with
disabilities,  and  minorities,  percolate  occasionally,  the  country’s  record  demonstrates
that it values the importance of human rights.
