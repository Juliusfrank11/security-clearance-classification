In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  admitted  that  he  received  the  diagnoses
described in  SOR ¶¶ 1.a  and 1.b. (HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. His
admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant  is a  44-year-old  senior field  test engineer,  and he has worked  for  his
current employer, a DOD contractor, managing laboratories developing simulators and
fielding manuals for devices for the Army for six years. (Tr. 86-87; GE 1) He served in
the  Army  National  Guard  from  1996  to  2005,  and  he  was  honorably  discharged  as  a
Chief  Warrant  Officer  2  in  2005.  (Tr.  81,  84;  GE  1)  He  was  an  Apache  helicopter
mechanic and pilot. (Tr. 81) He received a physical and mental evaluation from the Army
which did not indicate any mental-health disqualifying issues. (Tr. 81) He injured his knee
and received surgeries in 2003 and 2004. (Tr. 83) He is not receiving disability from the
Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA).  (Tr.  129)  He  has  not  served  in  a  combat  zone;
however, he served a tour in Kuwait from 1999 to 2000. (Tr. 129; GE 2 at 2) In 2007, he
attended college; however, he did not receive a degree. (GE 1 at 10) In 2010, he married,
and he does not have any children. (Tr. 129)
From  2005  to  2013,  Applicant  worked  for  DOD  contractors  training  helicopter
pilots  on  simulators.  (Tr.  84-85)  From  2013  to  2014,  he  supported  engineers  in  a
development environment. (Tr. 85) From 2014  to 2015, he worked with  simulators for
another  DOD  contractor.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  1997.  (Tr.  87)  His
periodic reinvestigation was in 2007. (Tr. 87) There is no evidence of security violations.
He  has  never  received  any  adverse  employment  actions  such  as  reprimands  or
suspensions. (Tr. 88)
Psychological Conditions
Applicant’s medical records indicate he first experienced bipolar symptoms when
he was six years old. (AE L at 145) Applicant denied any mental-health issues before
2005;  however,  he  was  the  victim  of  sexual  abuse  around  age  six.  (Tr.  107,  129)
Applicant’s grandmother was schizophrenic. (Tr. 128) Both of his parents have suffered
from depression. (GE 3 at 4)
In 2004, Applicant’s grandfather died, and  friends who were military aviators died
in accidents  at  Fort Hood, Texas and  Iraq. (Tr. 89)  Applicant  was engaged; however, the
engagement was not going  well. (Tr. 89) He was taking  pain medications after his knee
surgery.  (Tr.  89)  He  was  also  dissatisfied   with   his  employment.   (GE  2   at   3)  In   2005,
Applicant  sought help from   a   general practitioner and   was  diagnosed   with   depression
and   Attention   Deficit   Disorder  (ADD),  and   he   was  prescribed   Cymbalta,   an   anti-
depressant.  (Tr.  88, 106-108;  GE  2  at  3) He  took Cymbalta  for a  week or two. (Tr.  108)
He  began  to  think about committing  suicide. (Tr. 90, 130) His father took him  back to  see
his doctor. (GE 2  at 3) He learned  when  he  went back to  see  his treating  physician  that
he  mistakenly  received  an  excessively  large  dose  of  Cymbalta. (Tr. 91) A  flight surgeon
advised  him  to  stop  taking  Cymbalta  and  then  to  see  how  he  felt. (Tr. 91)  He  complied
with the  flight surgeon’s advice.
In  2006,  Applicant  was  feeling  lethargic  and  tired,  and  he  went  to  see  another
general practitioner. (Tr. 91; AE L at 45) He was diagnosed with depression and possibly
ADD. (Tr. 91) He was prescribed antidepressants and Ritalin for ADD. (Tr. 91, 110) The
side  effects  of  the  medications  made  Applicant  feel  worse,  and  despite  medication
changes, he was not improving.
Later in 2006, Applicant went to see Dr. D, a psychiatrist, who diagnosed him with
a Bipolar Disorder. (Tr. 93) Applicant said for the first time he experienced episodes of
mania. (Tr. 111-112) He tried multiple mood stabilizers. (Tr. 112) He slept about three
hours over a four-day period, and he said his inability to sleep was due to taking Ritalin
medication.  (Tr.  112-113;  GE  2  at  3)  Applicant  believed  the  idea  that  he  was  manic
originated from his reaction to Ritalin. (Tr. 131) He felt “like Superman.” (Tr. 131) Dr. D
described Applicant as honest, candid, and reliable. (Tr. 92-93; AE L at 45, 154) Dr. D
said Applicant does not have a condition or treatment that could impair his judgment or
reliability, particularly in the context of safeguarding national security information. (AE L
at 154) Dr. D retired in 2008, and Applicant next saw Dr. E for about nine months. (Tr.
93; AE L at 45) The record does not contain Dr. E’s diagnosis.
From 2009 to 2010, Dr. F treated Applicant and he continued the Bipolar Disorder
diagnosis  and prescribed  Lamictal. (Tr. 114) Applicant  said  Dr.  F told  him he  was not
really sure the correct diagnosis was Bipolar Disorder. (Tr. 114) Applicant continued to
feel tired and lethargic; however, he did not feel depressed. (Tr. 115) Dr. F continued to
prescribe Lamictal, and Applicant took the medication because he was doing well with
this medication. (Tr. 114; GE 2 at 3) Dr. F recommended follow-up appointments every
six months or so to monitor how he was doing, and Applicant complied with this treatment
recommendation. (Tr. 115) In November 2010, he stopped seeing Dr. F because he was
moved  to  a  different  state.  Medical  records  from  Dr.  F  were  not  introduced  into  the
security record.
Dr. M, a psychiatrist, treated Applicant from April 2011 to October 2016. (Tr. 93;
AE L at 45) In April 2011, Dr. M wrote in Applicant’s medical records that he
presented   with   life   long   history   of   episodes  of   irritable  &   happy   mood,
excessive   [e]nergy,  decreased   need   for  sleep   and   increase[d]  sex   drive.
[Patient  (Pt)]  also  had   episodes  of   getting   depressed   and   irritable.   Pt
reported  having  disturbed  sleep  and  appetite, loss of  interest  in activity  of
daily   living,  lack  of   motivation,  multiple   episodes   of  anxiety   attacks,  and
multiple   episodes  of   crying   spells.  .  .  .  Pt  also  presented   with   history   of
feeling  anxious and  having  frequent  panic attacks. Pt  has also  a  long  history
of  paying  attention  to  details, difficulty  completing  prolonged  tasks, difficulty
initiating complex tasks, easily frustrated, and easily bored. (GE 4 at 1)
Dr. M diagnosed Applicant with Bipolar I Disorder (mixed type) in remission, ADD,
in  remission,  and  Obsessive
Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder,  Major  Depression
Compulsive  Personality  (OCP)  traits.  (Tr.  93-94,  116;  AE  L  at  45;  SOR  ¶  1.a)  Dr.  M
prescribed Lamictal for mood stabilization and Vyvanse for Attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD). (Tr. 116)
On  July 25,  2013,  Dr.  M  noted  that  Applicant  “is  doing  well.  Anxiety  and  mood
level is great. Illness history of Bipolar course was reviewed with [Applicant] with clear
history  of  manic  or  hypomanic  episodes  but  ocp  traits  and  anxiety  and  recurrent
depressive episodes. No side effects from meds. Supportive and individual therapy was
provided.”  He  changed  his  diagnosis  to  Major  Depression  in  remission,  ADHD,  and
Obsessive Compulsive Personality (OCP) traits. (Tr. 95; GE 4 at 17) Dr. M reduced the
Lamictal  prescription  from  150  mg  to  100  mg  for  mood  stabilization  and  Adderall  for
ADHD. (Tr. 117; GE 4 at 17) Dr. M noted Applicant’s judgment was logical and his mood
was  stable.  (Tr. 96;  GE  4  at 17)  Dr.  M advised  the  OPM investigator  that  he  was  not
confident  about  the  Bipolar  Disorder  diagnosis  and  the  correct  diagnosis  might  be
Anxiety, Depression, ADD, and OCD traits. (AE L at 45)
Applicant followed   all  prescribed   or recommended  treatment  from  April 2011   to
October 2014,   and  from   October 2014   to   February   2016.  (Id. at  46)   Applicant did  not
receive  any  treatment  from  October 2014  to  February  2016, and  Dr. M  did not remember
why  Applicant stopped  treatment.  (Id.) Applicant had  the  following  appointments with  Dr.
M: six  in 2011,  eight in  2012, one  in  2013,  three  in  2014, and  two   in  2016.  (Id.) Dr. M
believed  Applicant  would  carefully  safeguard  classified  information  because  he  is  a
perfectionist, anxious, and has OCD. (Id.) His last treatment with Dr. M was in October
2016. (Tr. 97; GE 4 at 22)
Medical  records  generated  by  Dr.  M’s  recommends  follow-up  appointments  as
shown in the following table.

Applicant said that even though the medical records in some instances said to see
Dr.  M  every  couple  of  weeks,  Dr.  M  told  Applicant  that  he  needed  to  see  him  when
needed or to renew a prescription. (Tr. 117-118) Dr. M kept him on Lamictal even after
Applicant told Dr. M that he was taking vitamins and Chinese medicine. (Tr. 118) Dr. M
never told him to stop taking Lamictal. (Tr. 118) In 2017, Applicant saw Dr. M’s spouse
because Dr. M was out of the office; however, he did not provide the dates when he saw
Dr. M’s spouse. (Tr. 119)
In November 2017, Applicant went to Europe with his spouse, and he forgot his
medications. (Tr. 97) He discovered he felt better without his medications. (Tr. 97; SOR
response,  ¶  D.II) Without  his  medications,  he  felt  stable  and  less  groggy.  (Tr.  98)  He
believes his mental health can be stable through a low carbohydrate diet and exercise.
(Tr. 99, 127; GE 2 at 2) When he cheats on his diet, symptoms of tiredness and lethargy
return, which has occurred five or six times. (Tr. 127-128)
The DOD CAF asked Dr. B, a licensed clinical psychologist, to evaluate Applicant
for continued access to classified information. (GE 2 at 1) In April 2020, Dr. B generated
a psychological report for the DOD CAF. (GE 2) Dr. B considered Applicant’s background
information,  her  clinical  interview  and  observations  of  Applicant,  and  Applicant’s
Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI). Dr. B provided a detailed mental-health history
of  Applicant,  and  she  diagnosed  him  with  Bipolar  II  Disorder,  Depressive  Disorder
(moderate, recurrent, in partial remission), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Obsessive
Compulsive Personality traits. (SOR ¶ 1.b; GE 2 at 5) Dr. B did not interview Applicant’s
spouse  or  coworkers.  (Tr.  99-101)  Dr.  B  explained  the  reasons  for  her  diagnosis  as
follows:
Applicant’s presentation  was inconsistent with  his psychological test results,
as he certainly is quite anxious, ruminative, and possibly hypomanic at this
time. His insight is clearly  lacking  and  his fixation  on  “blood  sugar issues”
and  diet  as  opposed  to  voicing  awareness of his psychiatric diagnoses is
concerning. He describes a  history  of  at least one  hypomanic episode  that
he   claims   was  the   result  of   taking   Ritalin   as   prescribed,  although   that  is
highly   unlikely.  He  also   describes   numerous  episodes  of   depression.
Therefore, I find  that the  prior diagnosis of  bipolar disorder is appropriate. It
does not seem  plausible that  he  has ADHD in my  opinion, as  he  does not
describe   his  attention   as  being   problematic  until  adulthood.  I  suspect  his
attentional issues are related  to  his other psychiatric conditions.  GE  2  at 5-
6.
Dr. B’s prognosis is as follows:
The   [A]pplicant’s  prognosis  is  poor,   based   on   his  limited   insight  and   the
absence  of ongoing  care for psychiatric conditions. This suggests increased
risk for instability, which can lead to impairment in judgment, reliability, and
trustworthiness. (GE  2 at 5-6)
Dr. S  assessed  Applicant’s mental-health  at  Applicant’s request. (Tr. 25-31) Dr. S
is a  licensed  clinical social worker who  has  a  Ph.D. in psychology. He  has never held  an
active  license  in  psychology  “because  I  can’t make  [any] money  doing  that.”  (Tr. 32)  His
only  testimony  involved  cases about the  need  for longer stays in hospitals.  (Tr.  32)   He
said  he   has  seen   Applicant  regularly   about  once   a   week   since   December 1,  2020,  or
perhaps it was about 20  times over 18  months. (Tr. 28-29) From  December 1, 2020, to
January  6, 2021, he  said “[s]even  sessions have  been  completed  and  no  symptoms of
Bipolar  Disorder  have   been   detected   during   this  time.   Neither   have   any   other   serious
symptoms  been  uncovered during  our sessions.” (AE  F) Applicant said Dr. S’s sessions
were  about   every   two   to   four  weeks.  (Tr.  126)  Dr.  S   did   not   review   Applicant’s   past
medical records.  (Tr.  36, 41) He was unaware that Applicant experienced  symptoms  of
Bipolar and   Major   Depressive   Disorder  for several  years. (Tr.   38)   Applicant   told   Dr.   S
about  a   depressive   episode   in  2005   and   suicidal  thoughts.   (Tr.  39)  He  was  aware
Applicant  went  four  days  with  only  three  hours  of  sleep.  (Tr.  40)  In  response  to
Department Counsel’s question about not sleeping much for four days, Dr. S said he was
aware of this fact “but I don’t see that – I’ve done that, nobody is labeling me bipolar.”
(Tr. 40)
Dr. S most recently saw Applicant for a 50-minute clinical appointment on May 11,
2022, or May 13, 2022. (Tr. 34) He also saw Applicant on April 15, 2022, and on May 5,
2022.  (Tr.  51)  He  based  his  diagnosis  of  “almost  perfectionistic”  on  his  interview  of
Applicant, his spouse, and his coworkers. (Tr. 33, 36) He noted in his report that Applicant
“discontinued his prescriptions for bipolar three years ago due to visiting out of country
and, serendipitously, having forgotten to bring his medications. No symptoms of bipolar
appeared when the medications were not taken. This is attested to by his above average
performance  and  being  symptom  free  at  work  and  at  home.”  (Tr.  44;  AE  F)  Dr.  S
suggested that Applicant was inconsistent about going to his appointments from 2011 to
2016  because  Applicant  “thinks  he’s  found  the  cause  and  a  solution.  He  stopped  the
meds, I know that . . . I don’t know the details of why he would do that, I have no idea. I
didn’t know that, but I can’t imagine being worried about it when you’re doing fine.” (Tr.
46)
Dr. S’s diagnosis is that Applicant does not meet the criteria for Bipolar Disorder.
(AE  F)  He  is  almost  perfectionistic.  (Tr.  35,  46-47)  He  did  not  talk  to  anyone  who
previously diagnosed Applicant. (Tr. 34) He does not  provide  “a serious diagnosis like
bipolar or schizophrenic, [he] always asks for a second opinion.” (Tr. 35) Applicant is not
taking  any  medications.  (Tr.  28)  Applicant  is  “doing  beautifully.”  (Tr.  29)  He
recommended that Applicant continue with talk therapy and psychotherapy because he
believes “all  folks could  continue with talk therapy.”  (Tr. 34-35) He recommended that
Applicant see a mental-health provider every 15 to 30 days “for his own mental growth,
if he chooses, not because he really needs it, because he’s trying to grow, to understand
himself.”  (Tr.  49)  His  recommendation  is  that  Applicant  see  a  mental-health  provider
whenever Applicant deems it necessary or “as needed.” (Tr. 50) He believes Applicant
is  trustworthy.  (Tr.  29)  Applicant  received  inconsistent  diagnoses  over  the  years,  and
bipolar disease is frequently incorrectly diagnosed. (Tr. 30) Incorrect prescriptions can
have adverse medical effects. (Tr. 30) Cymbalta is prescribed for depression; however,
it can trigger suicidal tendencies. (Tr. 31)
Dr. S was focused on Applicant’s current behavior and how he was performing at
work,  and  not  on  his  mental-health  history.  (Tr.  41)  He  said  he  did  not  care  about
Applicant’s  diagnosis  from  three  years  ago.  (Tr.  41)  He  acknowledged  that  “there’s  a
possibility that  they [will]  fall back  to  where  they  were,  but  there’s somebody  trying  to
survive now. That’s what I’m concerned with is now and the behavior.” (Tr. 41)
Applicant does not have any concerns about his mental health, and he  has not
taken any medications for his mental health since November 2017. (Tr. 104, 119; SOR
response, ¶ D.III) He does not believe he has Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. (Tr. 130)
He does not believe he has a chronic mental illness, and he does not believe he needs
psychiatric  care.  (Tr.  106,  120)  He  decided  not  to  return  to  see  Dr.  M  in  2017  after
consulting with  his spouse  who  does not  have  any training  in  psychology.  (Tr. 120) If
problems develop, he plans to seek help from a mental-health practitioner. (Tr. 105) He
is  willing  to  see  a  mental-health  provider  once  a  month  if  it  will  satisfy  security
requirements. (Tr. 132)
Applicant  said  security  officials  told  him  the  security  issue  was  the  Bipolar
Diagnosis,  and  he  believed  his  security  issue  was  resolved  when  Dr.  M  changed  his
diagnosis from Bipolar to Depression. (Tr. 121-122) He wanted to do whatever he needed
to  do  to  resolve  security  concerns.  (Tr.  122)  He  told  his  facility  security  officer  (FSO)
when  the  issue  of  his  mental  health  first  arose,  and  Applicant  said  “[e]ssentially  that
before he had a diagnosis that he later attributed to blood sugar and not the diagnosis
he  was  given.”  (Tr.  60)  Applicant  told  his  FSO  that  he  stopped  following  treatment
recommendations and taking his medications without communicating with his treatment
provider.  (Tr.  61-62)  The  FSO  did  not  recommend  whether  he  should  follow  medical
advice or tell him that he needed to communicate with his treatment provider about not
taking his medications. (Tr. 62) He relied upon his FSO for advice on security matters.
(Tr. 122) His FSO did not consider him a threat to national security. (Tr. 62-63)
Applicant did not know what to do when he received the SOR. (Tr. 123) He sought
advice  from  supervisors  in  his  company.  (Tr.  123-124)  They  suggested  he  seek  an
opinion from a third party, and he sought assistance from Dr. S. (Tr. 124) He provided
his  medical  records  to  Dr.  S.  (Tr.  125)  Dr.  S  told  Applicant  he  might  have  situational
depression in 2005 because of stress. (Tr. 125-126)
Character Evidence
Applicant  presented  three  character  witnesses  at  his  hearing  and  16  written
statements  from  his  coworkers,  friends,  pastor  and  spouse.  (Tr.  53-79;  AE  G)  The
general  sense  of  their  statements  is  that  Applicant  is  friendly,  reliable,  diligent,
professional, responsible, detail oriented, and trustworthy. (Id.) They did not provide any
negative information about his mental health, work performance, and disciplinary actions.
(Id.)  He  is  a  valued  asset  to  his  company  who  makes  important  contributions  to  his
company. (Id.) He supports his spouse and his community. (Id.) His work performance is
outstanding. (Id.) Their statements support his continued access to classified information.
