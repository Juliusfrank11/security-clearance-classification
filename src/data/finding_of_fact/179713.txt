In 2016, Applicant was depressed after returning to the United States from Korea,
and he was having problems in his marriage. (Tr. 30; GE 3 at 3) On about 10 occasions
over a three to four-month period, he surfed the Internet with his cell phone looking for
dating opportunities and because of curiosity. (Tr. 31, 32-33)
On   or  about   December  14,   2016,   Applicant   located   and   responded   to   an
advertisement about dating  and  sexual encounters. (Tr. 29-30) He  was 34  years old in
December 2016. (Tr.  37)  After about  10  emails back and  forth  over several hours, the
person  (Ms. C)  advised  Applicant that she  was 14  years old.  (Tr. 36)  Applicant said he
“replied, no, you’re not.  [H]e  just  didn’t believe” Ms. C. (Tr. 36) He  wanted  proof  of  Ms.
C’s age, and  he  engaged  in commentary  back and  forth  with  Ms. C about her  age. (Tr.
36) Eventually, he  came  to  believe  Ms. C  was actually  14  years old.  (Tr. 44)   He never
communicated  with  Ms. C  over the  telephone.  (Tr.  36)  He knew  sexual communications
with  an  underage  person  was illegal. (Tr.  37)  He expressed  concern  to  Ms.  C  about  being
discovered. (Tr. 38) Despite  this concern, he communicated about sexual matters to  Ms.
C, a  female  he  believed  to  be  14  years old,  because  of  his fantasy. (Tr. 38;  GE  6)  He
could  not or would not  disclose  details  about  the  fantasy  at  his  hearing. (Tr. 38-39, 66)
He  never  disclosed   details  about  the   fantasy   to   anyone;  however,   he   denied   that  his
fantasy was to engage in sexual relations with a  14-year-old girl. (Tr. 38)
Applicant  requested  that  Ms.  C  send  him  nude  pictures  of  herself  including  her
genitalia. (Tr. 40, 44) Ms. C did not send him any pictures; however, he sent her three
pictures of himself: one of his face, and two of his genitalia. (Tr. 40-41) He was unsure
whether she asked for the pictures. (Tr. 64) He sent one picture of his genitalia after he
learned  Ms.  C was  14  years old.  (Tr. 41) In emails,  he  offered  to  teach  Ms.  C how to
perform various explicit sexual acts. (Tr. 43; GE 6) He provided Ms. C with information
about websites for the purpose of having her view pornographic videos. (Tr. 44; GE 6) He
denied that he suggested that Ms. C go to any Internet sites containing child pornography.
(Tr.  63-64)  He  also  offered  to  perform  sex  acts  on  Ms.  C,  and  he  requested  that  she
perform sex acts on him. (Tr. 43; GE 6) He said exceptionally gross things to Ms. C about
what he wanted to do with his bodily fluids. (GE 5; GE 6) Applicant asked Ms. C to meet
him during the day where they could be alone because he was worried about being caught
by law enforcement. (Tr. 43; GE 6)
On December 29, 2016, an Air Force investigator interviewed Applicant about his
communications  with  Ms.  C,  and  he  admitted  the  allegations.  (Tr.  46,  61;  GE  6)  The
investigators  examined  his  computer  and  cell  phone  for  evidence.  (Tr.  53,  64)  The
investigators retained his cell phone, and there has not been any allegation that Applicant
viewed child pornography. (Tr. 64)
Applicant said he did not propose a place to meet with Ms. C, and he insisted that
he was not really going to engage in sex with her. (Tr. 65) He said:
Because   I  wasn't  going   to   do   anything   like   that.  Honestly,  I  thought
somebody  was  messing  with  me  at  that  time. So,  I didn’t  want,  for  one, I
couldn’t  do  that. That’s  sick, twisted,  and  I  don’t even  know  why  I went  as
far as I did.  But to  actually  go  and  meet somebody  and  do  something  like
that,  no, I can’t do that.  (Tr. 62-63)
In about July 2017, Applicant received NJP under Article 80, UCMJ, for attempting
to  commit  a  lewd  act  upon  a  child  by  intentionally  exposing  his  genitalia  via
communication  technology  to  a  person  he  believed  to  be  14  years  old,  but  had  not
attained the age of 16 years. (Tr. 56-58; GE 5 at 4) He admitted the conduct and offense
alleged  in  the  NJP.  (Tr.  58)  The  commander  imposed  a  reduction  in  grade  to  staff
sergeant (E-5), forfeiture of one half of one month’s pay for two months, and a reprimand.
(Tr. 58; GE 5) The commander who imposed the NJP recommended that Applicant be
allowed to remain in the Air Force; however, the next commander wanted to discharge
him. (Tr. 59) In March 2018, the Air Force administratively discharged him from the Air
Force for misconduct, specifically sexual perversions. (Tr. 52, 60) The conduct that was
the basis of the discharge is detailed above. (Tr. 53)
Applicant  disclosed  the  conduct  described  above  to  his  spouse,  in-laws,  and
employer.  (Tr.  53-55)  Applicant  received  counseling  from  a  therapist  with  experience
counseling  and  treating  pedophiles.  (Tr.  47)  He  was  unsure  about  her  credentials;
however, he believed she was a mental-health professional and possibly a social worker,
psychologist,  or  psychiatrist.  (Tr.  47)  She  advised  Applicant  that  he  did  not  meet  the
criteria for pedophilia. (Tr. 47-48) She did not provide a letter indicating her diagnosis or
prognosis.
Applicant  also   received   counseling   for  depression,   anxiety,   and   ADHD  issues
through  the  Department of  Veterans Affairs. (Tr. 26)  He received  Wellbutrin  for a  month
or two  to  treat  his depression; however, he  did not like  the  side  effects and  he  stopped
taking  it. (Tr.  49-50) Applicant  and  his spouse  participated  in marital counseling. (Tr. 48,
50) He attended  a  five-day  counseling  and  education  session  with  his spouse. (Tr. 26,
50)  He believed  the  marital counseling  was helpful and  effective. (Tr. 50) He also received
financial counseling. (Tr. 51)
Applicant said:
I am  incredibly  sorry  for my  actions during  that time. I’ve  gotten  deep  within
my  church.  Right now  I’m  one  of  the  youth  leaders. My  wife  and  I,  we  do
kids  youth  ministry. . . .  I’ve  done  everything  I can  to  try  to  get help that way
this can be resolved.  I  can’t believe I  did this.  I’m  now doing whatever I can
to  show  that this isn’t me. The  paperwork and  stuff, the  things that I did,  this
isn’t  me.  (Tr. 26)
Applicant loves his country and regrets his misconduct. (HE 3) He is doing everything he
can to show he is rehabilitated and deserves a security clearance. (Id.)
