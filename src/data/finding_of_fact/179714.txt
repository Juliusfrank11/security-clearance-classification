Applicant is 54 years old. He married in 1989 and separated from his wife in 1992.
A divorce was never finalized. Since 2010 Applicant has cohabitated with a woman. He
has six children. He received his high school diploma in 1985 and  enlisted in the U.S.
Navy  after  graduation.  In  1995  he  was  administratively  separated  under  Other  Than
Honorable  conditions.  He  claimed  at  the  hearing  that  his  discharge  was  subsequently
upgraded.  He  held  a  security  clearance  while  in  the  Navy  and  during  periods  of
subsequent employment. He was employed by a DoD contractor as a tradesperson since
November 2018 and at the time of his submission of his e-QIP. In March 2022, he began
working  for  a  different  DoD  contractor.  He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a security  clearance  in
relation to his employment. (Tr. at 16-20, 35, 41-42.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)
In paragraph 1 of the SOR, the Government listed numerous acts of misconduct
by  Applicant  resulting in  the  issuance  of  bench  warrants  for failure  to  appear  in  court,
including an outstanding bench warrant issued in June 2017 and charges of contempt of
court on at least four occasions. The SOR also alleged that in 1994 Applicant was taken
to Captain’s Mast for offenses involving fraudulent checks. In addition, the SOR alleged
that Applicant deliberately provided false information three times on his May 2019 e-QIP.
In his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in paragraph 1, except he denied the
falsifications  by  virtue  of  responding  only to  the  underlying  claims  of  criminal  conduct.
(Answer at 1-3.)
The details regarding each of the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 1 are as
follows:
1.a   Outstanding   bench   warrant  issued   June   2017.  Applicant  failed  to  appear  in
court on June 15, 2017, as required for a readiness hearing on a driving violation citation.
On June 20, 2017, the court issued a bench warrant for his arrest and set bail at $10,000.
The  underlying  charge  was  issued  in  about  February 2017  and  was  for  Driving  with  a
Suspended License (DSL), after his license was suspended or revoked for driving under
the influence of alcohol (DUI). Applicant license has been suspended or revoked since
about 1994 for DUI. He was originally arraigned on the DSL charge on May 1, 2017, after
being stopped for speeding. He was also charged with speeding. In his Answer, Applicant
admitted the SOR allegation about an outstanding bench warrant and wrote that he was
homeless  at  the  time  and  had  custody  of  his  son.  He  explained  that  he  had  no  funds
available to pay a fine, although there was no fine to pay at the court hearing he missed.
He blamed his five-year delay in resolving the bench warrant on his work schedule, which
included  travelling  overseas.  At  the  DOHA  hearing,  he  testified  that  he  resolved  the
outstanding warrant in May 2022. He provided no documentation, however, to support
his testimony. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 21-25, 33; GE 7 at 9, 17.)
1.b   Additional bench  warrants,   and   May   2009  arrest for Fugitive   from   Justice   in
another  state.  The  SOR  alleged  that  bench  warrants  had  been  issued  for  Applicant’s
arrest for failure  to  appear in  court in  State 1  in  or about  July 2005,  September 2006,
February 2009, as well as the June 2017 bench warrant alleged in SOR 1.a. The SOR
also alleged that Applicant was arrested in May 2009 in State 1 for being a Fugitive from
Justice in State 2. Following his arrest, he was extradited to State 2 on June 19, 2009. In
his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in this subparagraph 1.b. He testified that
the  bench  warrants  were  issued  because  he  was  delinquent  on  his  child  support
payments. At the DOHA hearing, he clarified that he assumed the bench warrants were
due to child support issues. He testified that he has two ongoing child support issues that
he hopes to resolve with an insurance payment for a car accident. He also explained that
he was extradited to State 2 for failure to pay a probation fine. He sought to shift the blame
for  the  non-payment  of  the  fine  in  State  2  to  a  woman  with  whom  he  once  had  a
relationship. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 25-29, 36-37; GE 6 at 7; GE at 7 at 1, 5, 7, 17, 21.)
1.c  Multiple  charges for Driving  on  a  Suspended  or Revoked  License  due  to  a  prior
DUI. Applicant was issued citations for this driving offense in or about December 1994,
December 1995, March 2008, August 2008, December 2016, and February 2017. In his
Answer, he admitted these allegations and citations. He testified at the DOHA hearing
that he  still has to  complete an 18-month  program  to  be  eligible  to  receive  his driver’s
license. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 29-33; GE 6 at 6; GE 7 at 13, 15.)
1.d  Multiple  charges of Contempt of Court.  Applicant has been found in contempt
of court on at least four occasions, specifically in May 2005, September 2007, May 2009,
and May 2012. In his Answer, Applicant admitted this allegation. At the DOHA hearing,
he  explained  that  the  contempt  citations  were  likely  due  to  delinquencies  in  his  child
support payments over a number of years. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 33-38; GE 6 at 6- 7; GE 7
at 10, 21.)
1.e   October 1994   Non-Judicial Punishment for issuing   fraudulent  checks.   In his
Answer, Applicant admitted that he was charged with this offense. Included in the record
evidence is a report of investigation prepared by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service,
dated  October 18,  1994,  which  states  that Applicant  was  punished  administratively on
October  16,  1994,  in  connection  with  a  related  Naval  Criminal  Investigative  Service
investigation into fraudulent check activity. Applicant received a reduction in rank to E-4,
30 days’  restriction, 25 days’  extra duty, and forfeiture of ½ pay for two months, which
was suspended for six months. At the DOHA hearing, Applicant denied the misconduct.
He admitted  that he  received  another Captain’s mast in  1995  and was administratively
separated from the Navy. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 38-43; GE 6 at 4; GE 8.)
1.f.  Falsification   on   e-QIP   under  Section   22   -  Police   Record.  The  focus  of  the
Government’s  three  falsification  allegations  under  Section  22  of  the  e-QIP  is  whether
Applicant has ever been convicted of an offense and sentenced to a term of imprisonment
exceeding one year, or charged with a felony offense, an offense involving firearms, or
an offense involving alcohol or drugs. He answered this question in the negative when in
fact he had been charged with a felony offense and was convicted and sentenced to a
term of imprisonment exceeding one year. Separately, he was charged with an offense
involving both drugs and a firearm. He has also been charged with an offense involving
alcohol. The details are as follows:
1.f.i  Failure  to   disclose   Applicant’s   April  2004   arrest   in  State   2   for
Possession   of   Marijuana   5   Lbs  or  Greater.   This  was  a   felony   charge.   In   his  e-QIP,
Applicant  characterized   this  charge   as  a   misdemeanor.  The   FBI   report  in  the   DOHA
record reflects  that both  the  charge  at this arrest and  the  charge  to  which he  pled  guilty
were felonies.  He was sentenced  to  two  years of  incarceration  and  five  years of  probation.
In  August 2009,  his probation  was revoked  because  his  fine  had  not been  paid,  and  he
was sentenced  to  serve  up  to  nine  months  in  jail. Applicant’s extradition  from  State  1  to
State  2  in  2009,  discussed  in  SOR 1.b  above, was in response  to  his probation  revocation.
He was released  from  jail in February  2010.  In  his July  2019  background  interview, he
failed   to   voluntarily   disclose   that   the   charge   was  a   felony.  When   confronted   with   the
Government’s  information   that   the   charge   was  a   felony   and   he   was  sentenced   to   two
years  of   confinement,   he   did   not   dispute   either  fact.   In   his   Answer,  he   wrote   that   the
charge   was  “presented”   as  a   misdemeanor   though   he   acknowledged   that  the   offense
“carried” a  two-year sentence.  He also denied  that he  possessed five  pounds  or  more of
marijuana.   At   the   DOHA   hearing   Applicant  insisted   the   2004   charge   was  for  a
misdemeanor.  He also  denied  being  sentenced  to  two  years of incarceration.  Applicant
did not  deny  that  he  served  nine  months in  jail  after his probation  was revoked  for non-
payment  of the  $8,000  fine  imposed  as  part  of  his original sentence. His testimony  was
inconsistent with  the  FBI report in  the  record  evidence  that  the  charge  was a  felony  and
that he  was sentenced  to  two  years of  incarceration. His testimony  was  unconvincing  and
lacked  credibility. Applicant’s e-QIP  falsification  was deliberate.  (Tr. at 43-47;  GE  1  at  33-
34;  GE 2 at 12;  GE  6 at 10-12.)
1.f.ii  Failure  to   disclose   a  December  1995   arrest  and   felony   charge   of
Possession, Purchase  Cocaine  Base  for Sale and  related  charges, including  Possession
of  a  Controlled  Substance  while  Armed. Applicant pled guilty to Transportation with the
Intent to Sell Narcotics Controlled Substance and was sentenced to 270 days in jail and
three  years  of  probation.  This  charge  is  a  felony,  and  it  involved  drugs  and  a  firearm.
Applicant failed to disclose this arrest and the charges, and he did not voluntarily disclose
them during his July 2019 background interview. In his Answer, Applicant did not try to
explain why he did not disclose,  in his e-QIP,  these charges and conviction, for which he
served  jail time.  At  the  hearing, he  sought  to  explain  his  omission  based  on  the  number
of   years  that  had   passed   since   these   charges.  His  testimony   was  unconvincing   and
lacked  credibility. Applicant’s e-QIP  falsification  was deliberate.  (Tr. at 47-52;  GE  1  at  32-
34; GE 2 at 12;  GE 6 at  5.)
1.f.iii  Failure to  disclose  February  1993  arrest  and  charge  of  DUI with  a  BAC
over 0.10%. The documentary records in evidence reflect that Applicant was arrested for
DUI on December 5, 1994. In his e-QIP, Applicant provided two separate dates for this
arrest, December 1993 and December 1994.  At his hearing, Applicant testified that he
only had one DUI and that was in 1993. His license was suspended at that time. In his
background interview, however, he described his DUI arrest as occurring in December
1994. In his Answer, Applicant admitted to this arrest, though he denied having a BAC
over 0.10%. I am unable to find in the evidence any official record of a second DUI offense
in  1993,  and  Department  Counsel  did  not  note  any  such  record.  Applicant  truthfully
disclosed on his e-QIP his one DUI, which occurred in December 1994 according to the
official records. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 53-55; GE 1 at 32-33; GE 2 at 11; GE 7 at 11.)
1.g  Falsification  on  e-QIP  under Section  24  –  Use of  Alcohol. Applicant failed to
disclose  on  his  e-QIP  treatment  received  in  May  1993  at  a  Navy  Counseling  and
Assistance  Center  (CAAC)  as  a  result  of  his  use  of  alcohol.  Applicant  was  referred  to
Level II treatment for alcohol abuse at a Navy CAAC and completed his treatment in May
1993. The e-QIP question in Section 24 asks if the individual has ever been ordered or
asked to seek counseling or treatment as a result of his use of alcohol. The question also
asks if the individual has ever voluntarily sought counseling or treatment as a result of his
use of alcohol. Applicant answered both questions in the negative, which was incorrect.
In his Answer, he claims he was never ordered to attend CAAC, but he states that upon
his arrival at a new duty station he was sent to CAAC. It is unclear what he meant by
those  statements.  At  the  DOHA  hearing,  he  clarified  that  he  simply  forgot  about  the
treatment.  He  further  explained  that  he  never  sought  the  treatment  nor  was  he  ever
ordered to attend it. He testified that his attendance at the CAAC was simply part of the
requirement of reporting to a new duty station. He explained in his July 2019 background
interview  that  the  CAAC  alcohol  education  program  also  satisfied  the  education
requirements he was ordered to take after what he described as his 1993 DUI conviction.
Under  the  wording  of  the  e-QIP  question,  his  attendance  at  CAAC  alcohol  education
treatment required  an  affirmative  answer. Applicant’s  testimony on this SOR allegation
was  confusing,  disjointed,  unconvincing,  and  lacked  credibility.  Applicant’s  e-QIP
falsification was deliberate. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 55-59; GE 1 at 35-36; GE 2 at 11, 14.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct)
The  Government  cross-alleges  as  criminal  conduct  the  personal  conduct
allegation  set forth  in subparagraph  1.a.  concerning the  outstanding June  2017  bench
warrant. In his Answer, he denied having ever been involved in any criminal activity. He
wrote that all of the alleged incidents of criminal activity were the result of “’being in the
wrong place at the wrong time.’” (Answer at 3; Tr. at 59.) As discussed above, Applicant
testified  that  the  2017  bench  warrant  was  resolved,  but  he  provided  no  supporting
documentation.
Paragraph 3  (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
is
financially  overextended  and
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
therefore  potentially  unreliable,
because  he
untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR
identifies three past-due debts that have been referred to collection. The debts total about
$9,000. In his Answer, Applicant admitted each of the allegations, but asserted that two
of  the  debts  had  been  resolved  and  that  he  has  been  trying  to  contact  the  creditor  to
resolve the third debt (SOR 3.b) (Answer at 3.)
The current status of the allegations in paragraph 3 of the SOR is as follows:
3.a.  Cellphone   account  in  collection   in  the   approximate   amount  of   $1,416.
Applicant admitted that he failed to pay this bill when it was due because he lost his job
in 2018 and was unemployed for about two-to-three months (June 2018 to August 2018).
He testified that he paid this account in June 2021. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 60-61;
GE 4 at 1; GE 5 at 6.)
3.b.  Rental account in collection  in  the  approximate  amount  of $7,305. Applicant
was  unable  to  pay  his  rent  due  to  his  loss  of  employment  in  June  2018.  He  was
unemployed from June to August 2018. He vacated his residence in October 2018 with
about  four months  of  rent  ($1,780  per month)  unpaid.  Applicant  testified  that  since  he
returned from his most recent overseas business trip in 2021, he has tried to contact this
creditor, but he has not been successful. Applicant’s background interview conducted by
a  U.S.  Government  investigator  occurred  in  July  2019.  The  investigator’s  report  of
investigation  summarizing  the  interview  was  attached  to  DOHA’s interrogatories  in  the
record. Applicant noted in his interrogatory responses that he agreed with the report as
accurate and adopted the report as his own statement. In that report, it was noted  that
Applicant  was  in  contact  with  this  creditor  at  the  time  of  the  interview.  He  was  told  he
would receive in the mail a statement with the balance due. He told the interviewer that
he planned to pay the debt off in installments by May 2020. He provided no documentary
evidence  addressing  the  current  status  of  this  debt  or  his  claimed  attempts  to  seek  a
resolution. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. at 61-63; GE 1 at 9, 15; GE 2 at 5, 14; GE 4 at 2;
GE 5 at 5.)
3.c. Pay-day  cash  loan  account  in collection  in the  approximate  amount of  $315.
Applicant admitted that he failed to repay this loan when it was due. He testified that he
repaid this loan in or about June 2021. GE 3 reflects a zero balance due on this account.
This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 63-66; GE 3 at 5; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 6.)
