Applicant is a 55-year-old systems engineer and production and design manager
for  a  government  contractor,  employed  since  October  2018.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s
degree in 1989. He married in 1996 and divorced in 2017. He has three adult children
(ages 25, 24, 21). He has never held a security clearance.
The   SOR  alleges   under  Guideline   F   that  Applicant   is  indebted   to   the   Federal
Government for delinquent  taxes for tax  year 2017, totaling  about $30,058  (SOR ¶  1.a);
and   a   delinquent  tax   debt  owed   to   state   “A,”  totaling   about  $3,900   (SOR  ¶   1.b).  The
amended   SOR  alleged   that  Applicant  is  indebted   to   the   Federal  Government  for
delinquent taxes for tax  year 2016, totaling  $18,295  (SOR ¶  1.c); and  that Applicant failed
to  timely  file  his annual  Federal  income  tax  returns as required  for tax  years 2016  through
2018  (SOR ¶  1.d). Applicant admitted  SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  1.d  (Ans. 1),  and  denied  SOR ¶¶
1.b  and 1.c  (Ans. 2). In regard to SOR ¶  1.c,  Applicant replied that the  correct  total owed
for  2016   Federal taxes   is   $9,000,  and   that   he   is  on   a   payment  plan.   (Ans.  2)   He   also
provided documents with his answers.
Applicant owned a shipyard from about 1998 to 2012. He grew the business to 65
employees, and testified that it was reasonably profitable.  He testified that in 2011, he
agreed  to  build  two  large  crew  boats  costing  $7  million  per  boat.1  Despite  his  cost
estimates, the company lost money on the project. (Tr. 11-12)
In 2009, he filed Chapter 11 “reorganization” bankruptcy (Case No. 09-5***3). The
business claimed $3,634,797 in liabilities and $1,588,050 in assets.  (AE C) In October
1 Applicant testified that the boat contract loss  was in 2011 after which he filed  bankruptcy, but his
company’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy was filed in 2009 and the Chapter 7 bankruptcy was filed in 2010. His
personal Chapter 13 bankruptcy  was filed in 2009. It  is unclear whether the  boat contract discussed in
testimony  was part of the larger shipyard business or his subsequent small boat business.
2010, the Chapter 11 trustee filed a motion to convert case No. 09-5***3, to a Chapter 7
bankruptcy,  or  dismiss  the  case.  On  June  16,  2010,  the  U.S.  Bankruptcy  Court  judge
granted the motion to dismiss the Chapter 11 as of May 25, 2010. (GE 12) A final decree
discharging the trustee in the Chapter 11 case was granted in July 30, 2010. (GE 12)
In October 2010, Applicant’s company filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy (Case No. 10-
5***8),  on  estimated  liabilities  of  $2,372,589  and  assets  of  $56,151.  The  Chapter  7
bankruptcy  included  claims  from  15  creditors,  including  the  IRS  for  approximately
$142,932,  for  unpaid  taxes,  interest,  and  penalties  for  Federal  Social  Security,
unemployment, and corporate income taxes in tax years 2008 and 2009.  (GE 15) The
Chapter  7  bankruptcy  was  discharged  in  August  2012.  (GE  14)  In  his  supplemental
closing argument, he stated that “all taxes that were owed by [boat company], that were
in  the  form  of  payroll  taxes  were  paid.”  He  claimed  in  argument  that  his  company
accountant stopped paying $300,000 in payroll taxes after he lost oversight control from
another accountant. No independent documentation supporting this claim was submitted.
Applicant filed personal Chapter 13 bankruptcy (Case No. 09-5***6) in 2009 on the
advice of counsel to shield him from claims of the boat company’s creditors. He completed
the Chapter 13 plan by October 2010, and it was discharged.  He claimed $257,344 in
liabilities and $472,520 in assets. (AE C) A total of 45 creditors made claims, including
the  IRS who  claimed  approximately $345,203  in  taxes  owed;  the U.S.  Small Business
Administration who claimed  approximately $29,808 owed; and his state Department of
Revenue who claimed approximately $104,704 in taxes owed. The IRS claim included
debts for unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties for Federal Social Security, unemployment,
and corporate income taxes in tax years 2008 and 2009. (GE 13)
In 2011, Applicant started a small boat building business, incorporated as a limited
liability  company  (LLC).  He  testified  that  the  business  has  been  recently  unprofitable.
From 2009 to 2012, Applicant worked for a marine consulting company  before he was
laid off. In 2017, he decided to become self-employed and to use a $450,000  builders
loan  and  $250,000  cash  (including  taking  an  early  withdrawal  of  $200,000  from  his
retirement account with penalties) to build a speculative (spec) home with the intent to
sell when completed. He completed the home in 2017, and but could not sell it until 2019
because it was overpriced. (Tr. 13) It sold for $650,000, well below what he expected to
make. He claimed he lost $75,000 on the sale of the home and $200,000 in other costs
as a result of the spec home project. (Tr. 41-47) From January to October 2018, Applicant
worked  for  another  engineering  company,  before  accepting  his  current  position  with  a
defense contractor in October 2018. (GE 1)
Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns as required for tax years 2016
to 2018. The 2016 Federal income tax return was originally filed late; in November 2017;
and the 2017 and 2018 returns were filed late; in December 2019. No extensions were
requested. (GE 5) He failed to pay income taxes due for tax years 2016 and 2017. As of
December  2020,  he  owed  $47,317  in  delinquent  Federal  taxes  and  about  $5,200  in
delinquent state taxes. (GE 4) In his answer to the amended SOR, he noted that he owed
about  $9,000  in  delinquent  Federal  income  taxes,  and  continued  payments  on  his
payment plan. Applicant admitted  his outstanding  Federal tax  liability, but as a  result of
the  application   of  subsequent   tax   year refunds  to  his   balance, and   a   payment   plan   he
started   in   December  2020   and   ended   in   May   2022,   he   has   paid   off   the   Federal  tax
balance. Part of  his 2020  Federal tax  refund  was applied  to  his 2017  tax  debt.  (GEs 4  and
5)  He stated in testimony:
And, you  know, the  taxes –  I sort of  shoved  them  to  the  back. And  I  focused
on  my  children. And  I did.  Should  I have  filed  them?  Yes. I could have  –  I
could  have   eliminated   some   not-to-file   penalties  –   did-not-file   penalties.
That was definitely  a  mistake. Did  I have  the  money  to  pay  it?  I didn’t. I  didn’t
have the cash to  pay it. I was doing my best to support my kids, but I could
have gotten rid of  the penalties. (Tr. 14)
Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant also  filed his 2017 state income tax
return  late  (in  January  2020)  (GE  2),  and  his  2018  and  2019  state  tax  returns  late  (in
December 2021). (GE 2; Ans. 2) Applicant originally owed a $3,900 to the state for tax
years 2016 to 2020, but he filed amended Federal income tax returns that changed his
state obligation. As of January 2022, the state notified him that alleged debts for tax years
2016-2019  were  canceled based  on  information  he  provided them. (Ans.  2; Tr. 65-66)
Applicant also failed to file his 2019 and 2020 Federal income tax returns when due (2019
filed in December 2020; 2020 filed in about August 2021). All state and Federal income
tax returns have now been filed, and some have been recently amended. (Tr. 55-60; Ans.
2; GEs 2-9)
Applicant  has  not  sought  financial  counseling,  except  as  required  by  the  court
before filing bankruptcy. He blamed a dishonest accountant for his company’s failure to
pay business taxes  when due, and his own reluctance to use an accountant to file his
personal  taxes,  for  much  of  his  troubles.  He  expressed  regret  for  his  past  financial
situation and attributed them to his failed business, overextension because of his spec
home, bankruptcy, divorce, as well as expenses related to his children attending college.
He admitted not managing taxes well, but claims he has undergone tremendous personal
growth since then. He worked diligently to resolve his tax issues, and holds himself to be
responsible and accountable. He currently earns $146,000 per year, has about $4,000 in
liabilities, is paying on a mortgage, and has about $10,000 in cash. He submitted a page
from a credit report showing a “good” credit score.
