In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c,
1.e,  and  1.h,  and  he  denied  the  remaining  SOR  allegations.  (HE  3)  He  also  provided
mitigating information. (Id.) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 48-year-old logistics management analyst, working for the property
book  office  for  a  DOD  contractor  since  March  2021.  (Tr.  6,  9,  21) He  has  been  at  an
overseas  location  since  May  of  2021.  (Tr.  4,  6,  20)  In  1992,  he  graduated  from  high
school, and he has not attended college. (Tr. 6) He honorably served on active duty in
the Army from 1992 to 1997, and in the Army Reserve from 2010 to 2019. (Tr. 7) He was
a sergeant (E-5) when he left the Army Reserve. (Tr. 7) His military occupational specialty
(MOS) on active duty was M1A1 Abrams Armor Crewman (19K) and his MOS in the Army
Reserve  was  unit  supply  specialist  (92Y).  (Tr.  8)  He  has  periodically  held  a  security
clearance since 1995. (Tr. 24) There is no evidence of any security violations.
Applicant  was  married  to  his  first  wife  from  1999  to  2004,  and  he  married  the
second time in 2013. (Tr. 8) He has separated from his second wife, and on February 1,
2022, he filed for divorce. (Tr. 8, 20) He does not have any children; however, he has
three  step-children.  (Tr.  8,  22)  He  married  his  second  spouse  in  Germany,  and  he  is

stepchild is in the U.S. Air Force. (Tr. 22) In 2019, his spouse obtained employment in
pest control in the United States at an annual salary of $36,000 plus commissions. (Tr.
39-40) In 2020, she obtained a real estate license; however, she makes very little money
because the area is “saturated with real estate agents.” (Tr. 40) He estimated he will need
to pay his spouse about $4,500 monthly in spousal and child support after the divorce.
(Tr. 42)
Financial Considerations
In  2014,  Applicant’s  net  annual  income  as  a  government  contractor  working  in
Germany  was  $54,000.  (Tr.  24)  His  spouse  worked  in  a  convenience  store  stocking
shelves  and  later  in  a  gas  station  in  Germany.  (Tr.  26)  She  received  some  financial
benefits from the German Government for herself and children and some child support
for her youngest child. (Tr. 26)
In  May  2015, Applicant  moved  his family  from  Germany  to  the  United  States. (Tr.
27)  Germany  stopped  providing  his spouse  financial  support;  she  stopped  receiving  child
support; and  she  was unable to  immediately  obtain employment in the  United  States. (Tr.
29)   From   May   2015   through   July   2016,  he   worked   as   a   supply   supervisor  in  Middle
Eastern  Country (M  EC) 1.  (Tr. 28) His base pay  in MEC 1  was about $90,000; however,
his  housing   allowance   was  substantially   less  than   he   believed   it  would  be   when   he
accepted  the  employment.  (Tr. 29) Applicant and  his family  accumulated  debt during  May
2015 through July 2016. (Tr. 29)
Applicant  was  unemployed   from  July   2016   to   October  2016   when   he   obtained
employment in MEC 2. (Tr. 30-31) Starting  in October 2016, his annual salary  in MEC2
was about  $102,000, which included  his cost of living  allowance  (COLA). (Tr. 31-32)  In
March or  April 2017, a  new  company  took over the  contract and  reduced  his  hourly  pay
to   $15   and   eliminated   his  COLA.  (Tr.   31-32)   From   July   through   December  2017,  he
worked  in South  Central Asian  Country  (SCAC)  for an  annual  pay  of $127,000. (Tr.  32-
33) He did not return from leave on time, and  he was terminated  from his employment in
SCAC  for job  abandonment.  (Tr. 34) Applicant and  his employer disagreed  on  when  he
was supposed to return  from leave. (Tr. 34)
Applicant was unemployed from December 2017 through February 2018. (Tr. 34)
From February of  2018 through June of 2018,  he worked as  a warehouse selector  for
several companies and earned about $17 an hour. (Tr. 34) He was able to work overtime,
and his annual pay was about $52,000. (Tr. 34-35) From June 2018 through February
2020, he worked in SCAC as a property book officer, and his annual salary was $147,000.
(Tr. 35-36) From March 2020 to May 2020, he earned $13 an hour doing home repairs in
the United States. (Tr. 36) From May 2020 through March 2021, he was employed doing
inventories at various bases around the world for an annual pay of $70,000. (Tr. 36-37)
In  March  2021,  he  began  his  current  employment,  and  his  annual  salary  increased  to
$115,000, and then in May 2021, his salary increased to $149,000 when he was deployed
overseas.  (Tr. 37, 63-64)
Applicant’s current gross annual  income  including  COLA  is $149,000. (Tr. 21-22,
38) He also receives $801  monthly  because  he  has a  40  percent disability  rating  from  the
Department  of Veterans Affairs (VA). (Tr.  38)  He has  less than  $1,000  in his checking
and savings accounts.  (Tr. 41) He has $6,300 in a  401(k) account. (Tr. 41)
Applicant and his spouse purchased a house in the United States, and his mother
and step-father moved into the home with Applicant’s spouse and step-children. (Tr. 49)
His mother and  step-father were paying  rent.  (Tr. 49) Applicant’s  mother got sick, his step-
father had to retire,  and they moved into their own place in  2020. (Tr. 49)
In 2018, Applicant employed a credit service company to assist with debts, and he
paid a total of $1,400 to the company. (Tr. 47) The credit service company disputed debts,
and Applicant was dissatisfied with their services. (Tr. 47-48) At his hearing, Applicant
said the closing for the sale of  his house in the United States would occur in the near
future, and he and his spouse planned to use the profits of about $64,000 to pay off their
car loans and miscellaneous debts. (Tr. 42-44)
On August 11, 2022, Applicant provided  some bills and checks  issued from the
settlement of his mortgage on July 21, 2022: (1) $2,221 was paid to a non-SOR collection
company (vacation club) to address a $4,697 debt (AE B at 1-2); (2) $29,538 was paid to
address  a  non-SOR,  time-share  debt  originating  in  February  2019  in  the  amount  of
$28,429 (AE B at 3-7); $13,890 was paid to address a non-SOR debt that was in current
status (AE B at 8; GE 2 at 4); and (4) $3,112 was paid to address a non-SOR bank debt.
(AE B at 11-12) None of the payments were made to address SOR debts.
The  January  12,  2021  SOR  alleges  nine  delinquent  debts  totaling  $75,798  as
follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a $19,695 charged-off debt. Applicant was unable to make his
car payment after his pay was significantly reduced, and his vehicle was repossessed in
2017. (Tr. 50) In 2018 or 2019, he tried to discuss the debt with the creditor; however, the
creditor was unwilling to discuss the debt with him because it was charged off. (Tr. 51)
On August 15, 2022, Applicant said in an email that he contacted the creditor “to discuss
making payments once [his] divorce is final” and he knows what his monthly payments to
his former spouse will be. (AE F)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  a  $17,423  charged-off  credit  union  debt.  In  2015,  Applicant
obtained a personal loan, and in August 2015, he stopped making payments on it.  (Tr.
51-52)  He  said  “[t]he  bank  where  we  were  going  to  make  our  payments,  that  bank
changed and they would no longer accept the payments. And I, at the time, was not able
to  make  any  payments  online,  and  then  I  just  ignored  it.”  (Tr. 52)  On  August  4,  2022,
Applicant contacted the creditor, and the creditor agreed to a $100 monthly payment plan
with the first payment due on August 8, 2022. (AE E)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a delinquent debt related to a repossessed vehicle for $11,768.
Applicant said the balance was about $11,000 at the time the vehicle was repossessed.
In 2017 or 2018, the vehicle was sold at auction, and the creditor advised him in a letter
that the balance after the sale was $1,600. (Tr. 53) Later he contacted the creditor about
setting  up  a  payment  plan,  and  the  creditor  said  “well,  it's  been  charged  off,  there’s
nothing we can do about it.” (Tr. 53-54) Applicant did not make any payments to address
this  debt.  (Tr. 54)  On August  15,  2022,  Applicant  said  in  an  email  that  he  intended  to
contact the creditor to discuss making payments once his divorce is final and he knows
what his monthly payments to his former spouse will be. (AE F)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges an insurance account placed for collection for $472. The correct
amount of the debt was $267. (Tr. 55) Applicant said he paid the debt; however, he did
not  contact  the  creditor  before  his  hearing  to  verify  the  debt  was  paid.  (Tr.  55-56)  On
August 8, 2022, the creditor wrote the debt was paid in full. (AE C)
SOR ¶  1.e  alleges a  charged-off  personal loan  for $16,455.  The  debts in  SOR ¶¶
1.b   and   1.e   are  owed   to   the   same   creditor.   In   August  2014,  Applicant  obtained   this
personal loan,  and  in  2016,  this debt  was charged  off. (Tr. 57;  GE  4  at 3) He  did  not  make
any  payments to  address this debt.  (Tr. 57)  On  August  15, 2022, Applicant said he  had  a
payment agreement with  the  creditor, and  he  cited  to  the  agreement he  had  with  creditor
that related to SOR ¶ 1.b. (AE E; AE  F)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a charged-off account for $1,675. The debt was charged off in
January 2016, and Applicant said he paid this debt in 2016. (Tr. 57-58; SOR response;
GE 4 at 3) The debt does not appear on his August 28, 2020 and his July 6, 2022 credit
reports. (GE 2; GE 3)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges a collection account for $7,493. This debt related to rental of an
apartment or house. (Tr. 58) Applicant withheld rent until repairs were made. He provided
a letter from the collection agent indicating on May 31, 2019, he settled the debt with a
payment of $5,250. (Tr. 58-59; AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges a utility account placed for collection for $643. Applicant said
he established a payment plan and paid this debt. (Tr. 59-60; SOR response) He said his
home currently has a utility account with this SOR creditor. (Tr. 60) His August 13, 2018
credit report shows this collection account. (GE 4) His August 28, 2020 and July 6, 2022
credit reports do not include this account. (GE 2; GE 3)
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges a medical account placed for collection for $174. Applicant said
he had a medical issue in Germany, and the debt was paid. (Tr. 60-61) His August 13,
2018 credit report shows this collection account. (GE 4) His August 28, 2020 and July 6,
2022 credit reports do not include this account. (GE 2; GE 3)
Applicant’s mortgage account is a non-SOR debt. He said his monthly mortgage
payment was $2,900. (Tr. 42-43) His July 7, 2022 credit report indicates he obtained a
$429,000  mortgage  in  2019,  his  last  payment  was  in  February  2020,  and  his  current
balance  is  $445,600.  (GE  2  at  5)  He  said  his  mortgage  started  to  go  into  foreclosure;
however, the foreclosure process stopped because of the COVID-19 pandemic. (Tr. 62)
He  did  not  make  any  mortgage  payments  after  May  2020,  which  may  have  been  16
months or possibly until the closing on his home sale in July 2022. (Tr. 62, 64) He said
his wife used the extra funds not used to pay the mortgage to pay utilities and make some
home repairs. (Tr. 64)
Applicant  did   not  contact  any   of  the   creditors  after he   received   the   January   12,
2021  SOR  until the  date  of his hearing  on July  14, 2022,  because  he  felt  stress.  (Tr.  61-
62) He did not want to  make  any  promises about making  payments that he  would not or
could not keep.  (Tr. 62)  He said,  “I don’t really  have  an  excuse  other  than, you  know, I
just  didn’t  want  to  deal  with  the  stress.  I  had  enough  going  on  with  trying  to  make
payments and everything else on the stuff that I was paying on.” (Tr. 62)
After  his  hearing  Applicant  sent  a  budget  spreadsheet  and  checking  account
statements for January through July 2022; however, he did not mark or indicate which
payments were made to any SOR creditors. (AE D; AE F)
