Under the Influence of alcohol (DUI), tried, and found guilty. Applicant admitted the SOR
allegation. (SOR response) Applicant said he only had one or two drinks. (Tr. 42, 91) At
a road block, a police officer told Applicant to pull over. (Tr. 43) He received a field sobriety
test, and “he did the eye thing.” (Tr. 91) He believed the request for a breathalyzer test
was unfair because he was the only one required to do a breathalyzer test, and he refused

drunk; however, he was found guilty of DUI, and his driver’s license was suspended until

driver’s license  was not suspended. (Tr. 26,  45-47) He denied  that he  was drinking  any
alcohol  that day. (Tr. 49-50) He refused  the  breathalyzer because  “why  should I have  to
breathe  every  time  I get pulled  over because  I  had  a  DUI three,  four years ago.” (Tr. 50)
Applicant said  he  “beat the  case” in   court. (Tr. 27,  50)  Applicant  said the  police  officer
who  arrested  him  left the  police  force,  and  the  case  was dismissed  because  the  officer
“quit lying  about his involvement of  giving  [him] the  DUI.” (Tr. 31, 51)  The  police  officer
quit or retired  from  the  force because  “he  wasn’t going  to  participate  or involve  [himself]
in messing  with  people’s lives.” (Tr. 51) After his hearing, Applicant provided  an abstract
of  court record, which states his attorney  “entered  guilty  plea  30  days to  appeal or pay  5
days  jail  and   10   mandatory   days  comm   service   (dismissed   in   appeal   court-see   court

then   subsequently   pleaded   guilty   to   Driver’s  License   Suspended   for  DUI  (2nd)  and
Speeding.  Applicant said  he  was unaware his driver’s license  was suspended   after his
second  DUI arrest,  and  at  the  time  of the  driving  with  suspended  license  arrest the  case
related  to  the  second  DUI arrest in  2013  was still  pending  a  trial. (Tr. 51-53)  He  pleaded
guilty to the  speeding  offense. (Tr. 54)
SOR ¶ 2.i alleges on or about October 29, 2014, Applicant was arrested for and
then subsequently pleaded guilty to Driving While License Suspended for Other Reasons.
The police record indicates he pleaded guilty at trial. (GE 4 at 1) However, he said the
only time his driver’s license was suspended was after the first DUI until he received the
certificate showing he completed the alcohol-awareness class. (Tr. 32-33)

Conduct-Failure  to  Comply.  Applicant  said he  had  an  argument  with  the  mother of  his
child. (Tr. 55) A police officer wanted Applicant to leave the apartment he was sharing

SOR ¶  2.k alleges in  about August  2018,  Applicant  was charged  with  Failure to
Appear  and   Contempt,   after  he   knowingly  violated   a   court-issued   protective   order.
Applicant received  an  order from  the  court  directing  him  not  to  contact the  mother of  his
child  for 30  days. (Tr. 57) He was authorized  to  speak to  her through  a  third  party. (Tr.
59) Applicant went to  a  police  station  to  obtain  help getting  his clothes from  the  mother of
his  child.   (Tr.   29,  60)   The   mother   of  his  child   works  at   the   police   station.  (Tr.  30)  He
thought the  police  would help him; however, he  was arrested for violation  of  a protective
order. (Tr.  29)  The  charge  was dismissed  because  Applicant  did  not  understand  how  he
could  get  his  clothing   returned   from   the   mother  of  his  child.   (Tr. 29-30,  84) The   judge
found  Applicant  did not understand the  parameters of the  protective  order. (Tr. 73)
Applicant  currently  has  a  good  relationship  with  the  mother  of  his child,  and  he
speaks to her about every day. (Tr. 29, 58) They have meals together, and he described

alcohol about once a week. (Tr. 62) He limits himself to consumption of one or two drinks.
(Tr. 63) He has not received any alcohol counseling after the alcohol-awareness class he
received shortly after the October 2009 DUI arrest. (Tr. 63)
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b allege Applicant failed to disclose in his October 2, 2018 SCA
the criminal offenses in the criminal conduct section, supra. SOR ¶ 1.c cross alleged the
allegations in the criminal conduct section, supra.
Section 22, Police Record, asks in the last seven years: (1) whether Applicant was
issued a summons, citation, or ticket to appear in court in a criminal proceeding; however,
fines  less  than  $300  for  offenses  unrelated  to  alcohol  or  drugs  are  not  reportable;  (2)
whether he had been arrested by any law enforcement official; and (3) whether he has
been, charged, or convicted of any crime in any court. (SOR 1.a; GE 1 at 26-27) Section
22,  Police  Record,  also  asks  whether  he  had  “EVER  been  charged  with  an  offense
involving  alcohol  or  drugs.”  (Id.  at  27;  SOR  ¶  1.b  (emphasis  in  original))  Applicant
incorrectly answered, no, to these questions. (GE 1 at 26-27)
Applicant  said  he  received  assistance  completing  his  SCA,  and  he  answered
everything  to  the  best  of  his  ability.  (Tr.  32,  66)  He  may  have  misunderstood  the
questions. (Tr. 32) He focused on the seven-year time limit in several questions. (Tr. 68)
He did not disclose the 2011 DUI because of the seven-year time limit, and the second
DUI charge “shouldn’t be on [his] record anymore. I beat the case.” (Tr. 69-70) He said
he believed he did not have to disclose the second DUI arrest because it was thrown out
in court. (Tr. 73) Applicant understands the difference between an arrest, a charge, and
a dismissed charge. (Tr. 72-73) As to the August 2018 offense, Applicant acknowledged
the  police  arrested  him  for  violation  of  the  protection  order,  but  he  did  not  disclose  it
because he believed there should not have been a record of the offense and the charge
was dismissed. (Tr. 73-74)
Applicant said he did not tell the person assisting him with completion of his SCA
about the DUI arrest in 2014. (Tr. 95-96) He told her about the arrest in 2018, and that
the charge was dismissed, and she said “to put no and keep going.” (Tr. 85) He did not
ask  her  for  a  statement  corroborating  her  advice  about  not  disclosing  the  information
about dismissed charges on his SCA prior to his hearing. (Tr. 93) I suggested that he ask
her for  a  statement  after  his hearing.  (Tr. 93-95)  On  July  12,  2022,  the  director of  the
entity assisting the developmentally disabled wrote “Our staff did not guide or direct his
responses to the information which he provided” on his SCA. (AE B)
On  April  24,  2019,  an  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  investigator
interviewed Applicant. (Tr. 75-76) Applicant did not remember the interview. (Tr. 75-80)
The summary of  interview indicates Applicant disclosed the details of  his August 2018
arrest for violation of the protective order to the OPM investigator. (GE 2 at 3) The OPM
investigator confronted Applicant about several of his other arrests. (GE 2 at 4-5)
Applicant’s  sister  believes  Applicant  made   an   honest  good   faith   mistake   on   his
SCA because  he  was focused  on  the  dismissal of the  charges and  not on  the  arrests.  (Tr.
86) He believed  the  seven  years elapsed  and  his first DUI  was outside  that  time  limit. (Tr.
86) He was following  the  advice of  the  person  who  assisted  him  with  the  completion  of
his SCA. (Tr. 90) He did not intend or attempt to be deceptive. (Tr. 86)
Character Evidence
Applicant gets along well with his coworkers. (Tr. 34) He wants to provide financial
support to his family. (Tr. 34) On March 11, 2022, the director of a company assisting the
developmentally disabled said Applicant “has performed his work in our mail room very
well. We have seen no personal or employment related issues and do consider him to be
of good character.” (AE A) On July 12, 2022, the director wrote that Applicant “has been
an  excellent  employee”  and  there  were  no  known  issues  of  concern  pertaining  to  his
security clearance. (AE B)
Applicant’s sister said he has been able to live on his own in an apartment since
he was hired to work in the mail room. (Tr. 87) He has a separate apartment from the
mother of his child. (Tr.88) He is trustworthy, and he does a good job in the mail room.
(Tr. 86, 99) He has matured tremendously in the last several years. (Tr. 99)
