Applicant  is  a  55-year  old  married  man  with  two  adult  children  and  one  adult
stepchild. (Tr. 18) A previous marriage ended in divorce. Applicant is a veteran of the U.S.
Navy, serving from 1994 to 2010. He retired honorably. (GE 1 at 24) Applicant works for a
contractor as a management analyst. (Tr. 19) He is tasked with providing administrative
support  for  senior  government  employees,  military  members,  and  other  government
contractors. (Tr. 19) He has been employed in this line of work since retiring from the Navy.
After  retiring  from  the  Navy,  Applicant  matriculated  to  college  and  earned  a
bachelor’s degree in 2014. (GE 1 at 14) He has held a security clearance for 32 years. (Tr.
21)
Applicant  is  highly   respected   on   the   job.  According   to   his  supervisor,  Applicant
demonstrates  “a  keen   sense   of   security   awareness,  not  only   ensuring   the   proper
safeguarding  of  information  by  his  [sic]  self, but by  raising  the  awareness of  all  in [their]
division.” (Answer at 13)
Since 2009, Applicant has incurred approximately $25,000 of delinquent federal and
state  income  taxes,  and  approximately  $28,000  of  delinquent  consumer  debts.  The
delinquent federal income taxes stem from tax years 2009 to 2019, and are alleged in
subparagraphs 1.a through 1.h. Subparagraph 1.i sets forth Applicant’s failure to file his
state income tax returns. The remainder of the allegations concern Applicant’s consumer
debts.
Applicant contends his income tax problems related to problems managing his side
business. Because he “wasn’t business-smart at all,” he hired his brother to file his income
tax returns. (Tr. 34) Initially, “everything was fine.” (Tr. 35) Then, some years after starting
the business the IRS audited his finances. Applicant did not save many of his receipts
when he purchased inventory, and lost others when he relocated in 2016. (Tr. 35; GE 1 at
11)
Applicant also attributes his delinquent debts to the loss of income that occurred
when  his  GI  bill  benefits  ceased  in  2014,  which  coincided  with  health  issues  his  wife
experienced that compelled her to stop working. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 26) At or about this time,
his son was incarcerated, leaving Applicant and Applicant’s wife to care for the grandson,
and increasing household expenses. (Tr. 26) Strapped for cash, Applicant had to prioritize
which debt to pay and which debt to not pay. (GE 2 at 7) Applicant acknowledges that
some his financial problems were due to irresponsible spending. (GE 2 at 3) Specifically,
he  “took  on  probably  more  debt  than  [he]  should  have[,].  .  .  [and]  didn’t  make  smart
decisions money-wise.” (Tr. 32)
In  2018, Applicant contacted  the  IRS  and  negotiated  a  payment plan  to  satisfy  the
federal tax  delinquencies  alleged  in subparagraphs 1.a  through  1.h. Between  February
2018  and  April 2022, he  made  19  payments,  totaling  approximately  $3,540. (AE  A  and  AE
B)  Approximately $23,000 remains outstanding.
Applicant  has  yet  to  file  his  state  tax  returns  from  2012  to  2018,  as  alleged  in
subparagraph  1.i.  (Tr.  45)  However,  he  has  been  making  monthly  payments  ranging
between $80 and $137 since February 2021 through a payment plan. (AE C; Tr. 46) He
contends  that  he  began  making  payments  before  February  2021,  but  was  unable  to
substantiate this contention before the close of the record. The amount owed is unknown
from the record. Applicant was making payments under a previous payment plan in 2013,
but “let it lapse” in 2016 (Tr. 47) Although he is making payments towards the satisfaction
of his state tax debts, he has yet to file his state income tax returns. (Tr. 46)
The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.j, totaling $17,948, is the deficiency from a car
that the lender repossessed. (Tr. 25, 50) The car originally belonged to Applicant’s son.
When his son was incarcerated in 2016, Applicant assumed liability for payment of the car
note, but was unable to make them. The repossession was voluntary. (Tr. 47) The debt
remains  outstanding,  and  Applicant  has  no  plans  to  address  it  until  he  resolves  other
debts. (GE 2 at 8)
The  debt  alleged  in  subparagraph  1.k  is  owed  to  another  car  lender.  Applicant
opened this account in 2010. (GE 2 at 10) The account became delinquent in 2017 and
was  charged  off  later  that  year  in  August  2017.  (GE  4  at  11)  In  April  2019,  Applicant
contacted the creditor and negotiated a payment plan. (Answer at 4) He has been making
monthly payments, ranging from $96 to $507 since then. (Answer at 4) The current balance
is unknown from the record.
The  debt  alleged  in  subparagraph  1.l,  totaling  $604,  constitutes  a  delinquent
maintenance  fee  from  a  timeshare  property  that  Applicant  purchased  in  2017.
(Supplemental Answer at 3) He fell behind on these fees in 2019. He contends that he
satisfied the delinquent fee and is trying to sell the property to no avail. (Tr. 28) He stopped
making payments in January 2022, anticipating that the company he had hired to get him
out of this time share would successfully obtain his release from the time-share obligations.
(Tr. 28) If the efforts at getting out of the time-share responsibilities fail, Applicant “may go
back to making payments.” (Tr. 29)
The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.m, totaling $421, is a delinquent credit card that
Applicant opened to pay for car repairs. (Tr. 30; Supplemental Answer at 6) He will begin
making payments to satisfy it after he pays off his other debts. (Tr. 31)
The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.n, totaling $229, is a cable television service bill.
Applicant disputed this bill, contending that the dates that the service allegedly was not
paid do not correspond to the dates when he lived at the residence. (Tr. 31; GE 4 at 12) He
provided no proof substantiating the basis of his dispute.
The  debt alleged in subparagraph 1.o, totaling $186, is owed to an unidentified
medical creditor. Applicant denies this allegation contending that he was unaware of this
debt before the issuance of the SOR. (Answer at 1)
Applicant  earns  $62,000  annually.  (Tr.  38)  His  salary  has  increased  by
approximately  $15,000  over  the  past  two  years.  (Tr.  32)  After  a  four-year-hiatus,
Applicant’s wife has returned to work. She earns $23,000 annually, and she helps pay the
bills. (Tr. 51) Applicant contends that this additional income has enabled him to make more
steady debt payments. (Tr. 52) Applicant did not submit a budget into evidence.
