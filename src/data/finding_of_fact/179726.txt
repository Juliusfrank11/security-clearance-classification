Applicant is a 35-year-old civilian engineer of a defense contractor who seeks a
security  clearance.  Allegations  covered  in  the  SOR  and  admitted  by  Applicant  are
incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant  has  never  been  married  and  has  no  children.  (GEs-2;  Tr.  27)  He
earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  May  2008  and  completed  additional  post-graduate
classes  between  May 2008  and  June  2012. (GEs  1-2; Tr. 27) Applicant  did not  report
any military service and has never held a security clearance. (GEs 1-2)
Since October 2015, Applicant has worked for his current defense contractor as
an  engineer.  (GE  1;  Tr.  28)  Because  the  company  he  listed  in  his  security  clearance
application  has  a  different  name,  and  no  longer  sponsored  him  after  March  3,  2022,
initial confusion arose over the status of his sponsorship. (HE 1) Current DOHA tracking
entries  confirm  his  sponsorship  by  his  current  employer  under  a  different  name,  as  of
March  9,  2022.  (H1)  Whether  the  new  sponsorship  reflects  a  name  change  or  a
corporate purchase of his old company is unclear.
Previously,  Applicant  was  self-employed  as  a  freelance  data  analyst  (August
2015-October  2015)  for  a  start-up  company  and  provided  tutorial  services  between
June 2011 and August 2014. (GEs 1-2) Applicant has never held a security clearance.
Applicant’s finances
Records  document  that  Applicant  did  not  timely   file   his federal,  state,  and   local
district   tax   returns,   as   required,  for  tax   years  2012   through   2015.  (GEs  1-3)  He  is
credited  with  filing  his federal  tax  returns for tax  years 2012-2015  in  May  2021.  (AE  B;
Tr. 25-26) Applicant is  also credited  with  filing  his state  tax  returns for tax  years 2012-
2014   in  May   2021.  (AE   E; Tr. 30-31) According   to   a   notice   to  Applicant,   in  July   2021,
the  local district’s office of tax and revenue  processed  his filed 2015 income tax return in
2021   and   denied   his  refund   claim   because   his  refund   claim   exceeded   the   maximum
time  limit.  (AE  A) Applicant  attributed  his tax-filing  lapses  to  being  disorganized  and  not
focused on his tax filing obligations. (Tr. 29-30)
In November 2021, Applicant received a notice from the IRS that the Service did
not  accept  his  filed  federal  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2012-2015  due  to  the  lack  of  a
signature on the late-filed returns. (AE D; Tr. 31) He did not refile his 2012-2015 returns
(all  signed)  until  March  2022  and  has  been  denied  his  claimed  refunds  because  his
claimed refunds were too late for consideration. (AE B; Tr. 31-32) Applicant is satisfied
that he does not owe the IRS or his state and local district taxing authorities any monies
for tax years 2012-2015. (Tr. 34-35)
Applicant is current with all of his debts and earns $136,000 a year. (Tr. 28) He
maintains a strong credit standing (save for his filing lapses).
