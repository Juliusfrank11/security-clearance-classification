The SOR alleges that, as of June 11, 2021, Applicant owed two judgment debts of
$45,778 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and $3,189 (SOR ¶ 1.b); five collection debts totaling $33,264 (SOR
¶¶ 1.c-1.e and 1.g-1.h); and two charged-off debts totaling $5,060 (SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.i).
When  Applicant  answered  the  SOR,  she  admitted  all  the  debts  without  explanation.  I
accept and incorporate as factual findings that Applicant was indebted on the accounts.
After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  54-year-old  high  school  graduate  who  has  worked  as  an
administrative aide for a defense contractor since August 2020. (GE 1; Tr. 31-32, 40.) She
initially worked in a secure area but was moved when the SOR was issued. (Tr. 32-33.)
She does not need a security clearance in her current position. (Tr. 33.)
Applicant was married to her first husband for less than two years in the mid-1990s.
She and her current husband married in September 1997. They have a 21-year-old son
and a 23-year-old daughter. (GE 1.)
When  their  children  were  young,  Applicant’s  husband  had  a  very  successful
commercial real estate appraisal company in her hometown in state A, and they were able
to save money. Around 2006, they moved to  state B, and he continued to operate his
business long distance. Following the real estate crash in state A, they moved back to state
A,  but  stayed  only nine  months  because  their children  disliked  it  so  much. Applicant’s
spouse closed his business, and they returned to State B. (Tr. 55-56.) They used all of
their retirement assets, $161,000, to purchase and open a coffee house and tea room in
May 2010. (Tr. 24, 62.) Applicant operated the business year-round, although it was busier
in the summers. She had four or five part-time employees year-round and 15 part-time
employees in the summers. (Tr. 25.)
The coffee shop did well for the first four years, but business began to suffer after a
competing  shop  opened  nearby.  (Tr.  24.)  Applicant  and  her  spouse  paid  for business
supplies and other bills, except payroll, using Applicant’s personal credit-card accounts.
(Tr. 51.) In January 2015, they opened a second coffee shop. (Tr. 57.) Applicant’s spouse
got  a  job  at  $55,000  a  year  where  he  could  work  at  their  new  coffee  shop  while  also
working for his new employer. (Tr. 57.) Their  primary location never regained its initial
popularity. Applicant and her spouse adjusted spending by closing the shops during the
winter months when customer traffic was low, but they struggled to pay expenses. In the
summer of 2016, another competitor opened, which led to a further decline in customers.
By the time they closed the business in November 2016, Applicant was seriously in debt on
several credit-card accounts. (GEs 1-6; Tr. 26, 49.) They now realize that they should have
closed the business six months earlier than they did. (Tr. 26.) Their vendor bills exceeded
the business income. (Tr. 48.) They considered but ruled out a bankruptcy filing because
they did not want to jeopardize their children’s ability to obtain federal student loans. (Tr.
58.)
Applicant worked in retail from November 2016 until April 2017, when the store
location where she worked closed due to decreased revenues. She then worked at a call
center from May 2017 to August 2020, booking hotel reservations on commission and
being paid a small hourly wage. (GE 6; Tr. 50.) She earned more in commission during the
summers, about $6,000 in commissions. (Tr. 50.) Her spouse started over in the banking
industry around that time. (Tr. 50.)
On May 5, 2020, Applicant completed, and certified as accurate, a Questionnaire for
National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to an SF 86 financial record inquiry into
any delinquency involving enforcement, Applicant seriously underreported that she owed
only an estimated $50 on the credit-card account in SOR ¶ 1.a. She explained that she and
her  spouse  took  on  debt  for  two  coffee  shops  that  they  had  to  close  due  to  market
conditions and new competition, and that while they had taken out debt “under the name of
the company,” they did not realize that they were personally liable for the debts incurred for
the business. She  added, “no  court is involved. I am  not sure  I even have a judgment
against me.” She listed two accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b) in response to SF 86 inquiries
into any delinquency involving routine accounts, but indicated that she owed only $50 on
each account. She gave as the reason for the financial issue that  she and her spouse
could not file for bankruptcy as it would affect their children’s chances of obtaining student
loans for college. Applicant reported no other debts on her SF 86. (GE 1.)
Court  records  reflect  that,  as  of  January  2017,  Applicant  owed  $45,777  on  the
credit-card account in SOR ¶ 1.a. When asked about the discrepancy between the $50
balance reported on her SF 86 and the actual balance, Applicant testified that she thought
she owed less. (Tr. 37.) In May 2017, the creditor for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a obtained a
default judgment against her for $46,217. The account had been opened in the name of
her coffee shop with Applicant named as a cardholder. The card was intended to be used
for the company’s commercial or business purposes. Under the terms of the agreement,
Applicant was jointly and severally liable to repay the charges incurred on the account. In
early June 2017, the court issued notice to Applicant of the default judgment and that she
was required  to  pay  $35  per week to  the  creditor with  the  first payment due  on  July  3,
2017.  Applicant paid $3,900  before defaulting  on  her payments.  In  June  2019, the  creditor
filed to levy against Applicant’s bank assets for the $42,422 balance. (GE 5.)
In late April 2018, the creditor for the debt in  SOR ¶ 1.b filed for a small claims
judgment against Applicant in the amount of $3,188. In late August 2018, the court granted
a default judgment for $3,290. Applicant was ordered to repay the judgment at $35 per
week beginning on September 18, 2018. (GE 5.)
The delinquency histories for the debts in the SOR, as reflected on one or more of
the credit reports in evidence from June 2020 (GE 2), February 2021 (GE 3), and July
2021(GE 4), are reflected in the following table.

On July 6, 2020, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). She explained that when she and her spouse
made the difficult decision to close their coffee shops, they offered to make payments to
her creditors, but each wanted $300 monthly payments, which they could not afford so they
made  no  payments.  She  acknowledged  that  she  had  received  notice  of  the  two  court
judgments  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b),  and  explained  that  she  did  not  know  the  account
balances when she completed her SF 86. Her credit report was then reviewed. She did not
dispute the reported delinquencies, which she asserted had been used in operating the
business. When confronted with the $319 retail credit-card debt (SOR ¶ 1.i), Applicant
stated  that  she  had  an  account  with  the  creditor,  but  she  did  not  realize  it  was  in
collections. She indicated that she would look into the debt and pay it. She related that she
did not want the debts to adversely affect her security clearance eligibility or her ability to
obtain employment with the defense contractor, so she would contact her creditors and
begin making payments of approximately $50 on each account. (GE 6.)
Sometime in 2020, after her OPM interview, Applicant and her spouse looked into
repaying the debts incurred for their failed business through a debt-repayment plan with a
debt-relief company, but they could not afford the $1,400 monthly payment required under
the plan, so they did not start the process. (Tr. 28, 43-44.)
Applicant began working for her defense-contractor employer in August 2020. In
September 2020, she finished paying off a $34,901 car loan obtained in May 2015. She
had no delinquent debts on her credit report apart from the SOR accounts. (GE 3.)
Between 2017 and 2022, Applicant and her spouse obtained about $185,000 in
Parent Plus student loans for their children’s educations. (Tr. 27, 34, 45.) Their daughter
graduated  from  college  in May  2021, and  their  son  is a  senior in college. (Tr.  45.) In late
December 2020  or early  January  2021, Applicant’s spouse  purchased  the  home  that they
had  been  renting  for seven  years. The  purchase  price  for the  home  and  amount of  the
initial mortgage  loan  are not in evidence. In  January  2022, he  refinanced  the  mortgage,
which  is  in  his  name   only,   taking   on   a   new   loan   for  $420,000.  The   monthly   mortgage
payment is about $3,597. (Tr. 59-61.) He used  the  equity  in  their  home  to  pay  off  all  of  the
Parents Plus loans taken  out for their  daughter’s education;  some  of  their  son’s student
loans;  a  vehicle  lease; and  a  car loan  for an  older, 2015  model-year Jeep. (Tr. 29-30, 59-
61.) As to  why  they  did not use  some  of  the  equity  to  make  payments on  the  SOR debts,
Applicant responded, “I was just hoping it would just go away.” (Tr. 36.)
At her hearing, Applicant  exhibited little knowledge of the details of her and her
spouse’s financial affairs. Her spouse handles their household finances. (Tr. 30, 42.) His
annual salary is $120,000. (Tr. 62.) Applicant currently earns almost $25 an hour and takes
home $688 per week. (Tr. 40.) Since January 2021, they have had about $500 a month in
discretionary household income  after paying their expenses. (Tr. 64-65.) Applicant still
receives collection notices from some of the SOR creditors, which she and her spouse
ignore. (Tr. 66-67.) As to why they did not use some of their monthly discretionary income
to  pay  off  her  old  debts,  Applicant’s  spouse  testified,  “I  see  those  very  old  debts  as
something that will eventually go away.” (Tr. 65.) Applicant has $11,000 and her spouse
has  $25,000  in  their  respective  401(k)  accounts.  (Tr.  62.)  He  has  a  side  business  in
commercial  real  estate,  and,  over  the  past  year,  he  obtained  two  economic  industry
disaster loans for $3,000 to $4,000. He still has most of that money in a bank account. (Tr.
63.) He was not asked about, and did not volunteer any details about, his income from his
side business.
