Applicant,  28,  has  worked  for  her  current  employer,  a  federal  contracting
company, since October 2018. She completed a security clearance application, her first,
in March 2020. In response to questions about her use of illegal drugs or drug activity,
she  disclosed  that  she  purchased  and  used  marijuana  between  October  2008  and
to  self-medicate  depression  and  another  medical  condition.  She
March  2020
affirmatively  answered  the  question  relating  to  her  use  of  illegal  drugs  while  having  a
security clearance and the question regarding her intention to continue using marijuana
in  the  future.  In  her  April  2020  interview  with  a  background  investigator,  Applicant
clarified  that  she  mistakenly  reported  having  a  security  clearance  on  her  security
clearance  application,  but  affirmed  her  intention  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future  to
address her medical issues. At the hearing, she testified that she mistakenly indicated a
future intent to use marijuana on the security clearance application.  These disclosures
form  the  basis  of  the  SOR  allegations  in  this  case.  Applicant  reports  that  she  did  not
receive an interim security clearance. (GE 1-2)
Applicant  was  introduced  to  marijuana  in  middle  school,  using  the  drug  when  it
was  available  to  her.  While  in  high  school  between  2009  to  2012,  she  used  the  drug
twice a week to help with the symptoms of a medical condition. In 2013, at age 19, she
obtained  a  prescription  for  medical  marijuana,  and  purchased  it  at  a  state-sanctioned
dispensary. After turning 21, she no longer required a prescription to purchase the drug.

Between 2013 and 2017, Applicant was in college. Between 2013 and 2014, she
worked  at  a  funeral  home.  Because  her  position  required  drug  testing,  she  abstained
from  marijuana.  After  leaving  the  funeral  home  positon  in  2014,  she  resumed  using
marijuana to deal with a recurring medical issue that her doctor was unable to diagnose.
After graduating from community college in 2017, she decided to take a class to learn a
skill that would make her  an attractive candidate for a position at  a federal contracting
company. While taking the class, she abstained from marijuana to ensure that she was
eligible for hire, knowing that she would be required to pass a drug test if she received
an  offer  of  employment.  After  securing  her  current  job  in  October  2018,  she  learned
about  her  employer’s  standards  of  business  conduct,  which  included  the  admonition
that the company complied with the federal Drug Free Workplace Act and that because
marijuana  remained  illegal  under  federal  law,  the  company  prohibited  its  use  even  in
states where it was not against state law. (Tr. 16-17,19-20, 23-24; GE 3)
In  October 2019, Applicant experienced  pregnancy  loss. Between  October 2019
and  December 2019, she  used  marijuana  once  a  week to  self-medicate  her depressed
mood.  Concerned   that   her  depression   was  not  improving,  she   decided   to   get   help  in
December  2019.  She   sought  counseling   through   her  employer’s  employee   assistance
program   (EAP)  and   treatment  from   a   psychiatrist.   When   Applicant  began   taking
antidepressant medication  in January  2020,  she  used  marijuana  once  a  week until April
2020,   to   alleviate   the   side   effects   of  the   medication.  She   continued   to   use   marijuana
even   after  completing   a   security   clearance   application   in  March  2020.  Once   she   was
able  to   better  tolerate   the   medication,  she   stopped   using   the   drug.   Applicant  reported
that   she   has   not   used   marijuana   since   April  2020.  In   2021,   Applicant   again  sought
counseling  when  she  felt she  needed  additional support.  (Tr.  17,  20-21, 24-27, 30, 35-
36, 38-40)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  she  remained  on  antidepressant
medication  and  was  under  the  care  of  a  psychiatrist  for  medication  management.
According to a January 2022 letter from the treating  psychiatrist, she treated Applicant
for  anxiety  and  depression  with  a  short  course  of  medication  to  improve  Applicant’s
mood  and  anxiety.  The  course  of  medication  stopped  when  Applicant  went  into
remission.  The  psychiatrist  noted  that  Applicant  disclosed  her  marijuana  use  and
described her as being compliant with her prescribed treatment. (Tr. 37; AE B)
Applicant testified  that  she  no  longer uses marijuana  because  it is  not compatible
with   her  lifestyle   or  employment   obligations.  She   has  made   changes  to   her  life   to
support   her  mental  health,  including   medication,  exercise,  and   a   healthy   diet.  She
stated that she  no longer associates with individuals who use  marijuana. She  provided a
letter of intent  stating  her intent to  abstain from  illegal drug  use  in  the  future.  (Tr.  22,  30-
31, 42; AE A)
