The SOR alleges that, as of June 18, 2021, Applicant owed eight debts totaling
$49,484 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b, 1.e-1.f, and 1.h-1.k); three charged-off debts totaling $41,283
(SOR  ¶  1.c-1.d  and  1.g);  and  a  $535  judgment  debt  from  2019  (SOR  ¶  1.l).  When
Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted the alleged debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.f and 1.k, and
indicated that he was working on repayment terms for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.e,
and 1.f; that he has taken action to pay off the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k, but that the debt in SOR
¶ 1.d has been written off. Applicant denied owing the medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and
1.g, asserting that they were his spouse’s debts; the student loan delinquencies in SOR ¶¶
1.h-1.j, asserting that they had been paid in full; and the judgment debt, asserting that it
was for a check forged by his spouse.
I accept and incorporate as factual findings that Applicant was legally responsible to
repay the delinquencies admitted by him. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and
transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 62-year-old program manager employed by a defense contractor most
recently  since  July  1997.  He  previously  worked  for  the  company  as  an  engineering
assistant  from  September  1980  to  February  1994.  (GE  1.)  Around  July 1979,  he  was
granted a secret-level security clearance for his matriculation at one of the United States
military academies. He resigned his commission in October 1979 for medical reasons. (GE
1; Tr. 39.) Applicant held a secret-level clearance for his work with his current employer
until 2008, when his clearance eligibility was upgraded to the top-secret level. (GE 1.) He
currently holds a top-secret clearance and access eligibility to sensitive compartmented
information. (Tr. 88.)
Applicant attended college at night for 17 years. He earned an associate’s degree in
electrical  engineering  in  1985  and  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  professional  business
management in 1995. (Tr. 39, 145-146.)
Applicant  was married  to  his first wife  from August 1980 to January 1992. He has
two  children  from  that marriage  who  are now  ages 33  and  40. (GE 1; Tr. 52.) He married
his second  wife  in February  2005  and  was widowed  in March 2014. (GE 1.) His second
wife  was diagnosed  with  a  brain  tumor in August 2012. She  ended  up  in a  coma  and  spent
22  months in a  hospital until her  death. Applicant spent a  considerable amount of  time  at
the  hospital.  (Tr. 29.) On  her death, he  served  as the  administrator for her trust  (Tr. 53),
which included  the  home  that they  had  shared  during  their  marriage. She  owned  the  home
from  her previous marriage, and  the  deed  to  the  property w  as in her name  only. (Tr. 61-
62.)  Three   of   her  children   from   a   previous  marriage   (including   a   son   now   deceased)
contested  the  estate.  (Tr. 147-148.)  The  trust tied  up  Applicant’s finances,  as  he  continued
to  make  the  payments on  two  mortgages  with  initial balances of  $85,000-$90,000  and
$50,000-$55,000   on   the   property.   He  paid  off   the   mortgages  around   mid-2018,  and,
pursuant to  a  court order, sold the  property  in September 2018. The  proceeds from  the
sale were held by  the  trust until his second  wife’s estate  was settled  in January  2022. (Tr.
62-63.) In  the  end, Applicant and  his second  wife’s children  settled  out of  court. (Tr. 148.)
Applicant incurred  more than  $43,000  in attorney’s  fees in the  battle over the  trust assets.
(Tr. 34,146-147.)
Applicant incurred  substantial  credit-card debt  during  his  second  marriage,  in  part  to
pay  medical co-payments for his then-wife’s care. (Tr. 59-60.) He testified  that most of  her
medical debts were written  off  by  her creditors on  her death. (Tr. 59.) However, he  also
testified  that, in 2016, he  paid off  more than  $90,000  in credit-card debt on  four accounts
(two  accounts not alleged  and  the  accounts in SOR ¶¶  1.c and  1.f).  His monthly  payment
totaling   $4,000   on   those   four  accounts   was  unsustainable,  so   in  July   2016,  he  re-
mortgaged  his home  from  his first marriage  for $103,000 and used some of the funds to
pay  off  the  four credit-card accounts. (GE  2; Tr. 57-60.) Additionally, in October 2016, he
obtained  a  debt consolidation  loan  to  pay  off  some  credit-card debt.  That  loan  became
delinquent in October 2018 and was charged off for $20,138 (not alleged).
Still grieving the loss of his second wife and lonely, Applicant met his third wife in
late 2015 while out at a club. (Tr. 68, 87.) She was 29 years younger than him, had a
young child (Tr. 69), and portrayed herself as loving with good ethics. (Tr. 30.) They got
engaged in February 2016 (Tr. 70) and were married in September 2016. (GE 1.) They
lived apart throughout their marriage because she wanted to stay near her family, and it
was  not  a  reasonable  commute  for  him.  (Tr.  70-71.)  He  thought  that  they  would  live
together at some point, but it didn’t happen. (Tr. 60.) Applicant paid for her living expenses,
daycare for her child, and gave her additional money when she asked for it. (Tr. 30-31, 69.)
He gave her about $2,200 a month starting in February 2016. (Tr. 70.) She held part-time
employment in daycare. (Tr. 72.)
Around September 2016, Applicant’s spouse began running up debt on his credit
cards. (Tr. 74.) Initially, he saw no issues with her purchases, as they were for items he
thought she needed, like a television. (Tr. 75.) She initially charged $200 to $300 a month
on his accounts, which did not seem excessive until it “snowballed.” (Tr. 72.) Eventually,
unbeknownst to Applicant at the time (Tr. 77), she gained access to his credit cards by
going through his wallet and writing down the account numbers. She purchased items over
the telephone using his credit and pawned some items for the money. She pawned her
rings in late 2017 or early 2018. He argued with her over her misuse of his credit, but he
did not immediately close the accounts, as she would make “all kinds of threats” that he
could  no  longer  see  her  or  she  no  longer  wanted  to  be  a  couple.  (Tr.  31-33,  73-75.)
Additionally, in late 2017, she took his ATM card without his knowledge and drained his
bank account. He discovered it when he went to use the card. (Tr. 74.) Yet he continued to
support her because he took his marriage vows seriously, and she would cry that she
needed help. (Tr. 75.) He took no action to freeze his credit because he did not know he
could do so. (Tr. 100.)
In  August  2018,  Applicant’s  spouse  was  arrested  for  possession  of  heroin,
confirming Applicant’s suspicions that she had a drug problem. (Tr. 68.) They shared a
checking account, and on her arrest, he immediately closed all his accounts so she could
no  longer  have  access.  (Tr.  72.)  He  testified  that  he  paid  for  four  drug-rehabilitation
programs for her (Tr. 33, 76), spending “thousands of dollars” in increments of “$700 here,
$800 there.” He purchased plane tickets and sent her money for bedding and clothes. (Tr.
149.) During her fourth rehabilitation program, she purchased a car in early 2019 that was
eventually repossessed in September 2019. He asserts that she managed to obtain the
loan in SOR ¶ 1.b for the vehicle in his name without his knowledge. (Tr. 33, 37, 81.) He
stopped providing financially for his spouse in March 2019. (Tr. 80, 151.)  Applicant and his
spouse  tried  to  live  together  in  March  2019,  after  she  had  been  discharged  from  her
rehabilitation program, but that lasted only one week as he discovered she was again using
drugs. (Tr. 82-83, 151.) By the time he and his wife separated in June 2019, Applicant was
seriously in debt. (GEs 1-4.) He estimates that he provided his spouse a total of $150,000
to $200,000 between 2016 and early 2019. (Tr. 82.) He testified that “it took [him] a long
time to wake up to the fact that [he was] dealing with a drug addict.” (Tr. 141.)
Applicant  filed  for  divorce  in  May  2022.  (AE  C;  Tr.  46,  149.)  He  paid  a  $1,000
retainer fee upfront. (Tr. 148.) He and his spouse entered into a prenuptial agreement in
2016 when his annual salary was about $150,000. (Tr. 152.) Under that agreement, he
would have lost about $100,000, which was a percentage of his property holding from his
first marriage, if he filed for divorce without cause, so he delayed filing for divorce until he
was able “to demonstrate clearly beyond a shadow of a doubt that she had been in  —
unfaithful.” He found out that she was living with another man in 2019. He did not have the
funds to pay for a divorce attorney earlier. (Tr. 80, 85-87.) Applicant now indicates that on
the advice of his attorney, he plans to refile for divorce on June 24, 2022. (AE I.)
On  January  30,  2020,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  as  accurate  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to SF 86 inquiries into
delinquency involving routine accounts, Applicant reported that student loans he had taken
out  as  a  parent  for  his  son’s  education  became  delinquent  around  June  2019  in  the
amount  of  $15,000  and  were  placed  for collection.  He  reported  that  the debt collector
would not agree to a three-year repayment plan and so began garnishing his pay at $720
every two weeks since September 2019. He also listed two credit-card delinquencies of
approximately $23,000 (SOR ¶ 1.c) and $26,000 (SOR ¶ 1.f); a jewelry debt for $8,000
(SOR ¶ 1.e); delinquent property taxes of $7,500 (not alleged, on his property from his first
marriage); two smaller retail charge debts of $2,600 and $700 (not alleged) that he paid off;
and a car-loan delinquency of $26,000 (SOR ¶ 1.d) for a repossessed vehicle. He cited as
the reason for his financial issues that his “soon to be ex-wife is a drug addict and stole
monies [from him] placing [him] in extreme financial duress.” He indicated that those debts
that were not paid were on a list to be addressed once his divorce is finalized, and that he
planned to resolve the issues “in an order that is reasonable.” (GE 1.)
The delinquency and payment histories for the debts in the SOR, as reflected on
one or more of the credit reports in evidence from March 2020 (GE 4), March 2021 (GE 3),
and April 2022 (GE 2), are reflected in the following table.

Applicant was notified  by  letter from  the  U.S. Department of  Education  (U.S.  DoED)
of   its  intention   to   garnish   his  wages  for  the   defaulted   Parents  Plus  student  loans.  He
asserts nonetheless that the  garnishment of  his wages was voluntary  in that he  “chose  not
to  fight it.” The  U.S. DoED  wanted  a  lump-sum  payment of  the  balances in full  and  would
not agree  to  accept installment payments,  so  he  “accepted”  the  garnishment  as  it  operated
as an  installment repayment plan  in amount similar to  what he  planned  to  offer. (Tr. 134-
135.)  In  November 2021, the  U.S. DoED notified  Applicant  that he  was owed  a  refund  for
involuntary  payments received  since  collections  actions  temporarily  ceased  by  operation  of
law  on  March 13, 2020, due  to  the  pandemic. (AE  F.) The  letter did not specify  the  amount
to   be   refunded.   Applicant  maintains  that   the   document   is  proof   that  he   has  paid  the
Parents Plus student loans. (AE I.)
In June 2021, Applicant  bought a used vehicle. He put down about $3,000 and
obtained an automobile loan for $13,654 with a repayment term of $261 per month. (GE 2;
Tr. 37-38, 47, 93.) As of March 2022, he had made timely payments on the account to
reduce the loan balance to $11,970. (GE 2.) Applicant testified that he is paid up on the
loan through July 2022. (Tr. 38.)
In February 2022, Applicant received $108,000 in the settlement of his second wife’s
estate. (Tr. 42, 148.) He asserts that about $40,000 of the money went to his attorney for
legal fees associated with the resolution of the estate. He also paid off a $25,000 loan from
a lifelong friend. (Tr.  36, 64.) He explained that he  borrowed the  funds from his friend
because he had to find a new attorney to handle the dispute over his second wife’s trust.
(Tr. 66.) It is unclear whether some or all of this loan went to pay attorney fees over and
above the $40,000 paid in 2022.
Applicant currently rents his living quarters at $700 a month, but he has to move out
by the beginning of August 2022 because his landlord intends to renovate the upstairs. (Tr.
65, 67, 95, 117.) He expects the move to cost him $6,000 to $7,000, and his rent to more
than double. (Tr. 65, 94-95.) He testified that he has to resolve his living situation before he
begins  to  make  payments  on  his  delinquencies.  (Tr.  104.)  Applicant  sees  only  two
alternatives to address his debts: either bankruptcy, which he considers as not honorable,
or negotiating settlements for reasonable balances, which he sees as “paying blackmail in
a sense” because he did not personally benefit from the credit, was lied to by his third wife,
and suffered financially because of her abuse of his credit. (Tr. 105-107.) He has been
frustrated at times in his efforts to negotiate settlements for his past-due debts “because
people are greedy. They want their money. They want it yesterday. And they don’t care
what your circumstances are or what.” (Tr. 124.)
Applicant still owns the house that he bought in 1987. (Tr. 47, 56.) The home is too
far from his work for him to commute to work, so he rented it out for years until 2017. He
could not afford needed repairs to the property so it  sat vacant (Tr. 54.) He fell behind
about $7,500 on the property taxes. He paid some of the back taxes in April or May 2021
and the rest in 2022, using some of the money he received from his second wife’s estate.
(GE 1; Tr. 36, 64.) He took $12,000 to $14,000 of the $108,000 received from her estate to
fix up  the property so he could rent it out.  (Tr. 64-65.) A tenant signed a lease on the
property in February 2022. Applicant pays around $575 a month on the mortgage for the
property (Tr. 54-56) and  is paid $825 per month in rent. (Tr. 90.)  He has made timely
payments on the mortgage, which had a balance of $101,360 as of April 2022. (GE 2.)
Applicant has an open line of credit for $1,600 obtained in September 1993. As of
April 2022, the outstanding balance was $241. He has no open credit-card accounts. (GE
2.) He continues to receive offers of credit and was pre-approved for a credit card with a
$2,500 credit limit. That offer expired on May 18, 2022. (AE D.) He recently received a
“Certificate of pre-qualification” for a personal loan of between $1,000 and $50,000, with
the amount to be determined if he accepted the offer by June 16, 2022. (AE E.) He is not
planning to accept any of the credit-card offers before his divorce is finalized. (Tr. 46-47.)
He is considering obtaining a consolidation loan of $20,000 to $30,000 to pay off reduced
settlement balances. (Tr. 49, 123.)
Applicant is currently negotiating with the creditor that had charged-off $20,138 in
loan debt (not alleged in SOR) that has been unaddressed since 2018. (GE 3.) On March
3, 2022, the collection entity holding the debt was willing to settle the debt for $10,069. (AE
H.) Applicant testified that he was alternatively offered a loan that would include the more
than $20,000 he owes. (Tr. 141-143.) He has made no payments on that debt. After his
hearing, he retained the services of a credit-repair firm to correct his credit record and
begin  the  process  of  repairing  his  credit.  (AE  I.)  He  provided  no  details  about  that
arrangement or any no documentation in that regard.
Applicant’s annual salary from his defense-contractor employment is $177,000. He
received incremental wage increases over the years. (Tr. 151-152.) Over the past year, he
has had about $2,900 in monthly discretionary income after paying his living expenses,
which he testified has gone to paying off some debts and repairing his property so he can
rent it out. Prior to that time, his wages were being garnished for his parent student loans at
$1,500 a month. As of May 2022, he had about $3,000 in checking-account deposits and
$900 in savings. He has almost $300,000 in 401(k) assets. (Tr. 89-92.) He has not had any
credit counseling. (Tr. 95.)
Applicant has no record of violating security requirements. (Tr. 38, 157-158.) He
requests that he be given time to address his financial delinquencies and expects that he
will be able to settle some of the SOR debts over the next year, if he can settle them with
repayment plans rather than in lump-sums. (AE I; Tr. 158.)
