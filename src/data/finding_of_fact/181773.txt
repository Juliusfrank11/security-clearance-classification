Applicant is 43 years old. He married in September 2020. He has three children,
ages  21,  17,  and  15,  and  his  wife  has  two  children,  ages  17  and  13,  from  a  prior
relationship. Applicant received a high school diploma in 1998 and attended a technical
institute for two years, but did not receive a degree or certification. He enlisted in the U.S.
Navy in December 1998, but in April 2000 he was administratively discharge under Other
Than  Honorable  conditions.  He  held  a  security  clearance  while  serving  in  the  Navy.
Applicant  has  experienced  two  periods  of  unemployment  since  2016  (August  2016  to
September 2017 and December 210 to March 2019). He has been employed by a DoD
contractor as an artisan since March 2019. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance
in relation to his employment. (Tr. at 23-25; GE 1 at 14-16.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption)
The details regarding the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 1 are as follows:
1.a.   March  2000  Non-Judicial  Punishment  (NJP)
for  Drunkenness  and
Incapacitation  for  the  Performance  of  Duties.  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation  in  his
Answer. He was too drunk to report for duty. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 27, 32; GE 2 at 19.)
1.b.   June  2008  Charge  of  Felony  Battery  resulted  from  an  incident  in  which
Applicant  was  under the  influence  of  alcohol.  Applicant denied  the battery  charge,  but
admitted that he  was under the influence of  alcohol at the  time of  the dispute  with  his
domestic partner and unplugged the house phone while his domestic partner was making
a call to 911. He was taken to jail intoxicated. The record evidence reflects that the battery
charge was a misdemeanor. The altercation was just verbal and there were no injuries.
The  record  evidence  also  reflects  that  the  offense  of  maliciously  obstructing  a
communication  device  is  also  a  misdemeanor.  Neither  the  battery  charge  nor  the
obstruction of the call charge were prosecuted. Applicant recalls pleading guilty to being
drunk. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 28, 32-35; GE 8 at 17; GE 9 at 2, 4.)
1.c.  November  2008  charge  of  Driving  Under  the  Influence  of  Alcohol  (DUI).
Applicant admitted that he pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of DUI and was ordered
to  complete  a  DUI  program.  He  was  given  a  sentence  of  probation  for five  years.  His
driver’s license was also suspended. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 28, 35-36; GE 7 at 3.)
1.d.  February 2009 charge of Drunk in Public amended at the hearing to Driving
on Suspended License (DSL). Applicant denied the original allegation because he has no
memory of any such charge or arrest. Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to
conform  to  the  Government’s  evidence.  According  to  that  evidence,  Applicant  was
actually cited for DSL at that time. Applicant admitted this amended allegation. He was
sentenced to probation for three years. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 29, 35-37; GE 8 at 10; GE 10
at 8.)
1.e. March 2010 charges of  DUI and DSL and failure to complete court-ordered
DUI program. In his Answer Applicant admitted the arrest on that date and the charges.
He was on probation at that time for his 2008 DUI and his DSL convictions. He pled guilty
to misdemeanor DUI and was sentenced to probation for five years. The court ordered
him to attend a program for multiple DUI offenders. He denied part of the SOR allegation
because he disputed the Government’s claim that he had not completed the DUI program.
He testified that he completed the program, but his certificate of completion was never
submitted to the court. He requested the program manger to provide a duplicate certificate
to the court, and he submitted a copy of the certificate into evidence at the DOHA hearing.
The  certificate  reflects  that  Applicant  enrolled  in  the  course  in  October  2012  and
completed it in November 2016. He attributed the delay in enrolling and completing the
course to his inability to pay the fees associated with the program. It took him about four
years to complete an 18-month program. He claims that he sought extensions from the
court when he could not continue the program for financial reasons. (Answer at 2; Tr. at
29-30, 38-39; GE 7 at 3; AE A.)
1.f. April 2010 charges of DUI and DSL. Applicant asserts that these charges are
the same as those alleged in 1.e. The time difference between the two alleged dates is
only six days. He noted that during this period, he had no access to his vehicle, which
had been taken from him by the police. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 30, 39-40.)
1.g. August 2016 charges of DUI, DSL, Spousal Battery, and maliciously/unlawfully
removing  telephone.  At  the  hearing  Department  Counsel  moved  to  amend  the  SOR
allegation  by  deleting  the  phrase  “maliciously/unlawfully  removed  telephone”  on  the
ground  that  this  charge  was  part  of  the  charges  filed  against  Applicant  and  alleged  in
SOR  1.b,  above,  and was  not  a  part of  the 2016  charges.  Applicant  denied  the  entire
allegation.  He  believes  that  his  criminal  records  are  wrong  or  they  have  been
misinterpreted  in the  preparation  of the  SOR.  He asserted  that he  has only  had  two  DUIs
(2008  and  2010)  and  the  battery  charge  is a  duplicate  of  the  2008  charge. At the  hearing,
Applicant denied  the  DUI charge, but  admitted  he  was cited  for DSL  due  to  the  lack  of a
record  evidencing   his   completion   of  the   court-ordered   course   that   was  part   of  his
sentence  for the  2010  DUI.  He argued  that his driver’s  license  should  never have  been
suspended.  He claimed  that  the  DSL  charge  was withdrawn  after  he  established  that  he
had completed  the  program  by  producing  a  duplicate  of  his certificate  of  completion. I find
Applicant’s  testimony   regarding   the   DSL   charge   to   be   credible   and   that   the   SOR
allegation regarding other charges is based upon incorrect information. (Answer at 2; Tr.
at 30, 40-45; GE 2 at 23; GE 7  at 4; GE 8 at  3, 21-24; GE 10 at 3.)
Applicant has never received any in-patient treatment for alcohol abuse. He has
never been diagnosed with alcohol dependence or abuse. (Tr. at 45-46.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance  Misuse)
The details regarding the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 2 are as follows:
2.a.  March   2000   Non-Judicial  Punishment   for  testing   positive   for  marijuana.
Applicant was administratively  discharged   from  the  Navy   under Other Than  Honorable
conditions  as   a   result  of   failing   a   drug   test   on   March  2,  2000.  Applicant  admitted   this
allegation. He commented  that he  was 19  years old at the  time  and  was influenced  by  his
friends and  peers. He  regrets the  choices he  made  at that  time.  (Answer at 2, 5; Tr. at  49-
51; GE 6.)
2.b. Applicant used marijuana from 2000 until June 5, 2013. Applicant denied this
allegation on the ground that the June 5, 2013 date is incorrect. That date is his official
“clean date” for abstaining from both illegal drugs and alcohol. His last use of marijuana
was in 2012, the year in which he gained custody of two of his children. The information
in the report of his background interview about drug use until June 2013 is the result of a
misunderstanding by the investigator. That date only applies to his last use of alcohol.
(Answer at 2, 5; Tr. at 50-51; GE 2 at 20, 23.)
Paragraph 3  (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)
The  SOR  sets  forth  three  allegations  of  omissions  in  Applicant’s  e-QIP  that
resulted in false answers. The details regarding the SOR falsification allegations set forth
in this paragraph and Applicant’s responses are as follows:
3.a.   Failure  to  disclose  his  use  of  marijuana  in  the  seven  years  preceding  April
2019 in his response to Section 23 – Illegal Use of Drugs in the e-QIP. Applicant ceased
using marijuana in 2012 when he was granted full physical custody of two of his children.
He understood that responsibility required him to be drug-free. He did not list his last use
of marijuana sometime in 2012 because it was about seven years prior to the date of his
e-QIP  and  disclosure was not required  under the  question’s seven-year time limitation.
He credibly testified that the information in GE 2 regarding drug use until June 5, 2013, is
a misunderstanding. That date only applies to use last use of alcohol. (Tr. at 52-53; GE 2
at 20.)
3.b.  Failure  to  disclose  in  his  response  to  Section  22  - Police  Record  all  of  his
offenses involving alcohol and drug use during the period 2000 to August 2016 and an
alleged felony charge. Applicant was never charged with a felony, so he had nothing to
report in response to the e-QIP question regarding past felony charges. The same is true
with respect to the alleged 2016 DUI. Applicant disclosed his 2010 DUI arrest in response
to  Section  22,  and  in  response  to  Section  24  –  Use  of  Alcohol,  he  disclosed  the  DUI
offenders program he was ordered to take. He failed to respond correctly to a follow-up
question in Section 22 that asks for other instances of certain types of charges including
alcohol and drugs. As a result, he failed to list his 2008 DUI charge and his 2000 NJPs
for  alcohol  intoxication  and  drug  use.  He  failed  to  list  these  incidents  due  to
misunderstanding  the  question  and  acknowledges  that  he  answered  the  question
incorrectly. He said that he filled out the questionnaire, which he described as lengthy,
after  a  long  day  of  work,  and  he  did  not  clearly  understand  the  question.  He  credibly
testified that he had no intention to mislead the Government or to withhold this derogatory
information  from  many  years  ago.  In  his  background  interview,  he  volunteered  the
information regarding 2008 DUI before being confronted. (Tr. at 54-57; GE 1 at 31-32,
33-34; GE 2 at 7, 10.)
3.c. Failure to disclose his delinquent debts incurred in the seven years preceding
April 2019 in his response to Section 26 – Financial Record. Applicant credibly testified
that he failed to disclose his delinquent debts and repossessed vehicle due to oversight.
He acknowledged that he answered the question incorrectly. He said he was not prepared
to respond to these detailed financial questions. He did not have a credit report at the
time  he  prepared  his  responses  to  the  e-QIP  questions,  and  he  mistakenly  did  not
disclose certain debts in response to the questions. He had no intention to mislead the
Government about his debts. In his July 2019 background interview, Applicant discussed
his  debts  at  length  indicating  that  he  had  no  intent  to  shield  information  from  the
Government in his e-QIP. (Tr. at 55, 57-58; GE 2 at 10-18.)
Paragraph 4  (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
is
financially  overextended  and
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
therefore  potentially  unreliable,
because  he
untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR
identifies eight past-due debts that have been referred to collection or charged off. The
debts total about $23,000. In his Answer, Applicant denied all of the allegations under this
guideline, except one (4.b). (Answer at 3-4, 7-8.)
The current status of the allegations in paragraph 4 of the SOR is as follows:
4.a.   Credit  union  account  charged  off  in  the  amount  of  $14,888.  This  debt  is  a
vehicle loan account. Applicant defaulted on paying the monthly loan payments in 2016
during  a  period  of  unemployment  from  August  2016  to  September  2017..  In  2020  he
entered into a payment plan agreement with the creditor and has been paying this account
monthly.  GE  3  and  4  confirm  that  Applicant  is  “paying  under  a  partial  payment
agreement.” This debt is being resolved. (Tr. at 59-60; GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 4.)
4.b. Credit account in collection in the approximate amount of $1,263.  Applicant
paid this debt after his July 2019 background interview, possibly in 2020. He does not
have  a  receipt.  The  account  does  not  appear  on  the  most  recent  credit  report  in  the
record, dated March 31, 2022. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 60-61; GE 3; GE 4 at 2; GE
5 at 6.)
4.c. Credit account in collection in the approximate amount of $878. The original
creditor on this account is the same creditor as the one listed in 4.b, above. Applicant
testified that he only had one account with this creditor. In 2021 he disputed this debt with
the  credit  bureaus.  He  believes  his  dispute  is  still  under  investigation.  He  provided  no
evidence regarding the dispute. The credit reports in the record do not reflect that this
debt is disputed. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. at 61-62; GE 4 at 2.)
4.d.   Collection  account  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $593.  This  account  was
originally a credit-card account. Applicant paid this debt in May 2021. He provided proof
of payment of the debt. This debt has been resolved. (Tr. at 62-63; GE 4 at 2-3; GE 5 at
12; AE C.)
4.e. Payday loan account in collection in the approximate amount of  $315.  This
account became delinquent after Applicant prepared his e-QIP. Applicant paid this debt
in late 2020 or early 2021. This debt has been resolved. (Tr. at 63; GE 2 at 11; GE 4 at
3; GE 5 at 12.)
4.f. Credit union account in collection in the approximate amount of $815. Applicant
defaulted  on  paying  this  credit-card  account  in  late  2016  or  early  2017  when  he  was
unemployed. Applicant settled this debt for less than the full balance, as evidenced by a
credit report in the record, dated January 5, 2021 (GE 4). The settlement was paid in June
2020. Applicant provided proof of the resolution of this debt. This debt has been resolved.
(Tr. at 63; GE 3 at 7; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 5; AE B.)
4.g.  Collection account in the approximate amount of $4,516. Applicant disputed
this  account  in  about  April  2021  because  he  does  not  know  what  it  is.  The  dispute  is
confirmed  by  the  Government’s  March  31,  2022  credit  report  in  the  record  (GE  3).
Applicant called the original creditor identified in his credit report (Creditor A) and learned
that it is an online lender. He claimed that he has never taken out a loan from Creditor A.
His dispute has not been resolved. In his background interview, Applicant admitted that
he   received   a   loan   in   the   amount   of  $3,000   from   Creditor  A   in   May   2016   and   that  he
became  delinquent  on  the  loan  in  August  2016  due  to  limited  financial resources during
periods  of   unemployment.   Government   Exhibit  5   confirms  Applicant’s  loan   for  $3,000
from  Creditor A  and  the  dates  he  provided  to  the  investigator. This  debt  is  unresolved.
(Tr. at  64; GE 2 at 16; GE 3  at 5; GE 5  at 4.)
4.h.   Medical  account  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $294.  Applicant  does  not
recognize  this  debt.  He  insists  that  in  2019  and  2020  he  had  a  state-funded  medical
insurance policy for low-income families that has no co-pays. The date on which Applicant
became delinquent on this account is not apparent in the Government’s credit reports and
it  only  appears  on  the  oldest  report,  dated  May  11,  2019.  Applicant  has  reviewed  his
recent credit report and this debt does not appear on it. He has not taken any action to
dispute this debt. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. at 64; GE 2 at 11; GE 5 at 12.)
Mitigation
Applicant  summarized  his  life’s  journey  in  a  brief  statement  (AE  K).  He
acknowledged his history of misconduct when he was young and irresponsible. He also
admitted that  he  has a  history of  losing jobs  and encountering financial  difficulties.  He
wrote that he began to change his ways when he was granted full physical custody of two
of his children in 2012. In that year he stopped using illegal drugs, i.e., marijuana. In 2013
he ceased drinking alcohol so that he could become a better father. He joined a church
that has become central to his life along with his family. Now he is married at age 41. He
works on improving his character and being a better husband and father. He has been an
active participant in Narcotics Anonymous (NA) for over 8 years and has worked all of the
steps. He has been sober since June 2013. He has a support group as part of NA that is
important  to  him.  His  most  important  supporter  is  his  wife.  He  has  made  a  serious
commitment to himself and his family to provide his children with a better life. His children
have successfully developed into responsible individuals. His oldest is attending college
studying civil engineering, and the younger ones are excelling as well. (Tr. at 48, AE K.)
Applicant provided character letters from  senior managers, supervisors, and co-
workers at his place of employment and from his church pastor and assistant pastor. They
all describe Applicant in glowing terms and remark how he matured and devoted himself
to his wife and family and to his church. His pastor wrote that Applicant has “completely
turn[ed]  his  life  around”  and  has  “grown  emotionally,  mentally  and  spiritually.”  The
church’s assistant pastor commented that Applicant takes “full responsibility for his past”
and now is one of the pastors “must trusted and faithful friends.” At work, he is described
as “dedicated, hardworking, and possess[ing] a can do spirit.” He is praised for his work
ethic, reliability, honesty, integrity, and positive attitude, as well as his professionalism.
