Applicant  is  61  years  old  and  is  unmarried  with  no  children.  He  has  an
Associate’s  degree.  He  is  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  as  an  Engineer.  He  is
seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.

The  SOR  identified  three  allegations.  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  Federal
income tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2019.  He failed to timely file his state (A)
income  tax  returns  for  those  same  years.  He  also  failed  to  timely  file  his  state  (B)
income tax returns for tax year 2015.  Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth
in  the  SOR,  and  states  that  he  is  expecting  a  refund  when  they  are  filed.  Applicant
began  working for his  current  employer in  1982,  and  has  had  continuous  employment
with his company for 40 years.  He applied for his first security clearance about 38 or 39
years ago.  (Tr. p. 16.)
In about 1989, Applicant joined a professional group of engineers.  In about 1990
or 1991, he was told by an ex-registered agent of the IRS who was in the group that if
Applicant  had  no  tax  liability,  he  would  have  three  to  five  years  to  file  his  income  tax
returns to get his refund back.  It was not until Applicant’s father passed away in 2001 or
2002 that Applicant began having trouble getting his income taxes filed.  He stated that
he  was  overwhelmed  with  his  father’s  estate,  as  he  was  the  executor  of  the  will.
Applicant  just  did  not  have  the  time  to  get  everything  done.  Applicant  testified  that  he
always understood that he was required to file annual income tax returns regardless of
whether he was going to receive a tax refund.  (Tr. p. 23.)
Applicant admitted that at least twice in the past, he has taken the time to catch
up on his past-due income tax filings  when he  is forced to  fill out a  security clearance
application  during  his  security  clearance  renewals.  The  first  time  it  occurred  was  in
2013.  As  part  of  his  security  clearance  update,  Applicant  had  to  complete  a  security
clearance  application,  and  that  time  he  filed  his  past-due  income  tax  returns  for  tax
years  2011  and  2012,  which  were  filed  late,  but  were  filed  in  2013.  (Tr.  p.  25.)  This

another security clearance application in 2018, and filed his past-due income tax returns
for tax years 2013 through 2017 in August 2018.  (Tr. p. 26.)  Applicant states that he
was late filing these returns, depending on the year, because his truck was broken into,
his company laptop was stolen, his personal bags were stolen, and his tax information
including  all  W-2’s  were  in  his  personal  bags  that  were  stolen,  or  he  misplaced  his
paperwork and got busy and forgot to file.  (Government Exhibit 2.)
Applicant testified that he has now filed all of the income tax returns in question,
namely  Federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2011,  2012,  2013,  2014,
2015,  2016,  2017,  2018  and,  2019.  (Tr.  p.  24.)
In  regard  to  his  Federal  and  state
income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2018  and  2019,  they  were  not  filed  until  late  2020.
Applicant explained the  reason for that delay  was  because he  was  helping his mother
clean  out  the  family  home  and  moving  her  into  a  smaller  home.  Traveling  back  and
forth took time, and he got overwhelmed.  (Tr. p. 27.)  In regard to his Federal and state
income tax returns for 2020 and 2021, Applicant states that he is working on them.  (Tr.
p. 27.)
In regard to his failure to file his state (B) income tax return in a timely fashion for
tax year 2015, Applicant explained that his company sent him to work in state (B) on six
separate trips, for more than 28 days.  His employer was not familiar with the tax laws
that  impacted  their  employees  temporarily  working  out  of  state.  Applicant  researched
the matter, and determined that if he was employed for more than 28 days, he and the
other  employees  with  him  would  be  entitled  to  per  diem.  The  company  payroll
department then had  to  change  the tax withholdings for that period  of  time.  Applicant
was in contact with his Human Resources department and informed them of the issue.
It took a while for Applicant and the others with him to receive their W-2 Forms.  When
Applicant finally received all of the documentation necessary to file his income tax return
for State (B), it had passed the deadline for filing.  (Tr. p. 30.)  Applicant has now filed
his  2015  income  tax  return  for  State  (B).  Given  the  extenuating  circumstances  here,
this allegation is found for the Applicant.
Applicant testified that he has never believed in filing for an extension to file his
returns, and it did not make sense to him because if you have the time to do that, you
have time to prepare them and get them filed.  (Tr. p. 28.)
Applicant  admits  that  his  failure  to  file  his  Federal  and  state  (A)  income  tax
returns on time may go back as far as tax years 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010.
Applicant provided copies of his Federal and State (A) income tax filings for tax
years 2011, 2012, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021.  (Applicant’s Post Hearing Exhibit A.)
