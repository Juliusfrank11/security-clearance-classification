Applicant is 35 years old and was married in 2007 and divorced in 2014. He has
no children. He earned a high school diploma in 2005 and enlisted in the U.S. Marine
Corps  following  graduation.  He  served  on  active  duty  for  nine  years  and  deployed  on
three  occasions.  He  was  medically  separated  in  August  2014  under  Honorable
conditions. Applicant always planned on serving a full 20 years in the Marine Corps. His
medical  separation  was  a  disappointment  for  him.  At  that  time,  he  held  the  rank  of
Sergeant (E-5). He has worked as an aircraft technician for his current employer since
March 2021. He held a security clearance while in the Marine Corps.  He is seeking to
obtain a security clearance in relation to his employment. (Tr. at 6-7, 18-22.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
is
financially  overextended  and
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he
therefore  potentially  unreliable,
untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR
identifies seven past-due or charged-off debts owed by Applicant totaling about $37,000
(SOR 1.a through 1.g). In his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations and
commented that he has paid one of the debts. The existence and amounts of all seven
debts is supported by credit reports dated May 22, 2021; and November 5, 2021. (GE 3
and 4.)
Applicant  first  started  to  experience  financial  problems  about  one  year  after  he
separated from the Marine Corps. He had less income at that time than when he was in
the Corps. By 2016, the problems became more acute. He experienced a driving under
the influence criminal charge in October 2016 and had to hire an attorney and pay a fine.
He  described  that  his  financial  situation  went  into  a  downward  spiral  at  that  point.  He
worked as a day laborer from 2017 until 2021. He lived with his parents starting in 2017
to  reduce  his  living  expenses.  He  spent  a  lot  of  time  working  with  the  Veterans
Administration on his disability claim. He has a 60% disability rating, but a 0% rating for
Post-Traumatic  Stress  Disorder  (PTSD).  He  is  presently  being  reevaluated  for  PTSD-
related issues. He would like to believe that he does not have PTSD, but he is leaving
that  to  a  professional’s opinion.  He  believes that  his ego  and  “military  mindset”  kept him
from  asking  for help.  His lack of  work experience  and  a  college  degree  hurt his ability  to
find  a  suitable,  good-paying  job. On  April 9,  2021,  Applicant hired  a  credit-repair  company
to  help him  address the  delinquent debts he  had  accumulated.  He submitted  his e-QIP
hired  the  company  to  repair  his  credit  so  that  he  could  qualify
about four  weeks later. He
to purchase a  house in  the  future. (Tr. at 22-30, 34, 44; GE 1 at 33.)
The current status of the debts listed in the SOR is as follows:
1.a.   Collection  Debt   in  the   Amount   of  $1,063.   Applicant  determined  that  this
debt  was  for  a  retail-store  credit  card  account.  He  asserted  in  his Answer  that  he  has
settled the debt and had it removed from his credit report. He testified that he personally
negotiated a settlement  with  the collection agency based upon  the advice he received
from his credit advisor. He claims he paid the settlement of the debt in January 2022. This
debt is resolved. (Tr. at 30-33; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 1, 2; Answer Exhibit 1 at 1.)
1.b.  Charged-Off Debt in the  Amount of $8,089. This debt is for a  secured loan.
Applicant opened  this loan  in  April 2016  to  pay  and  consolidate  some  debts.  The  loan
was  collateralized   with   a   vehicle   that   Applicant  owned   without  any   debt.   He   stopped
paying  on  the  debt  in  October 2016  because  he  could  not keep  up  with  the  payments.
Because  of the  age  of this debt, Applicant’s credit advisors are telling  him  to  let  the  debt
be removed  from  his credit report after seven  years.  This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 39-
41; GE 3  at 2; GE 4  at 4; Answer Exhibit 1  at 1.)
1.c. Charged-Off  Debt  in the  Amount of  $4,341.  This debt is for an auto loan.
Applicant opened this loan in April 2016. He stopped paying on the debt in October 2016
because he no longer had a steady paycheck like he did as a Marine. As with the debt in
SOR 1.b, his advisors are telling him to wait for the debt to be removed from his credit
report after seven years. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 42-44; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 4;
Answer Exhibit 1 at 1.)
1.d Collection Debt in the Amount of $424. This debt is for a wireless telephone
account. He returned the phone to the service provider, but a balance remained on the
account. Applicant intends to pay this debt over the coming months this year, possibly as
early as July 2022. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 44-45, 55; GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 5.)
1.e  Collection Debt in the  Amount  of  $4,484.  Applicant opened this credit-card
account in May 2017. He defaulted on the payments a few months later. Under Applicant’s
“game  plan”  he has developed with his advisors, this debt will be one of the last debts
that he will repay. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 45-47; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 5.)
1.f  Charged-Off  Debt  in the   Amount  of  $16,433.  Applicant opened this credit-
card account in August 2013. He defaulted on the account in August 2016. Applicant does
not recall the original purpose of this debt. His credit advisor is disputing this debt to better
understand the debt. Applicant believes this may be a duplicate of other debts owed to
the  same  creditor.  If  the  debt  is  valid,  he  intends  to  negotiate  settlement  and  pay  it
sometime in the future. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 41-42, 47-48; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at
6.)
1.g  Auto-Lease  Account  Past Due  in  the  Amount  of  $2,285.  Applicant opened
this account in January 2016. He fell behind on three payments in 2017, and the car was
involuntarily repossessed. Applicant believes that the balance due on the debt after the
sale  of  the  car  is  about  $11,500.  Applicant  has  not  yet  received  guidance  from  his
advisors, so he has not attempted to pay this debt. He intends to repay the debt when he
is able to negotiate a settlement. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 48-52: GE 3 at 4; GE 4
at 8.)
Mitigation
Applicant is trying to maintain financial stability and not repeat his past mistakes.
He puts about $100 per paycheck into a savings account. He intends to use the funds in
that account to repay his debts. His current balance in that account is about $600. He
also contributes 15% of his paycheck into his employer’s 401(k) plan. He recognizes that
he will not be able to continue  in his current job past a certain age because the job is
physically demanding. He wants to be ready for retirement. (Tr. at 52-56.)
Applicant has a plan to repay most of his debts one day. The exceptions are the
three older debts owed to one creditor. He intends to let them drop off his credit report
due to their age. He plans to try to negotiate settlement and make payments of one debt
every five months. (Tr. at 52-56.)
