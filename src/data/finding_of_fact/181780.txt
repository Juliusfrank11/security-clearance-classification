The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  six  creditors  for  delinquent
accounts  that  were  either  charged  off  or  placed  for  collection  totaling  approximately
$50,000.  In his answer, Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR.
Credit  reports  of  the  Applicant  dated  November  17,  2020;  April  29,  2021;  March  3,
2022;  and  July  18,  2022,  confirm  that  he  was  once  indebted  to  each  of  the  creditors
listed in the SOR.  (Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5 and 6.)  Applicant began working for his
current  employer  in  February  2018.  This  is  his  first  time  applying  for  a  security
clearance.
Applicant  explained  that  his  financial  problems  started  as  a  result  of  his
compensation  package  changing,  which  significantly  reduced  his  income.  Applicant
explained that at his previous place of employment, he held a sales job and was given
an on-target earnings package of $120,000.  For three years, from 2015 through 2017,
he  over  achieved  and  earned  about  $180,000  annually,  much  more  than  his  target
earnings.  Because he was earning too much, his company restructured his competitive
plan, and for two years he was not earning even the on-target earnings.  He believes he
made about $100,000 those two years.  As a result, he fell behind on many of his bills.
He  stated  that  he  managed  to  keep  up  with  the  credit  accounts  that  he  had  open,
including his children’s school tuition and his student loan.
After leaving his previous employer, Applicant liquidated his 401k and borrowed
between $50,000 and $75,000 to keep his family afloat while he built his “sales pipeline”
at  his  new  job.  With  his  current  employer,  Applicant  stated  that  his  compensation
package has allowed him to pay back his delinquencies and satisfy his past due debts.
(Tr. p. 48.)  Applicant explained that he consolidated his debts and paid them off.  (Tr. p.
48.)  Applicant also stated that the  last  two years, 2020 and 2021,  he  has built up his
“sales  pipeline”  and earned close to $350,000  annually.  (Tr.  pp. 55, 56, and  61.)  He
has also been able to build up some savings.  Applicant  stated that he has only three
revolving credit cards and pays cash for everything else.  He and his fiancé are planning
to purchase a house next year.
Applicant explained that after taxes he now brings home about $2,100 every two
weeks.  He  also  receives  periodic  commission  checks  based  upon  his  sales.  He
testified  that  he  is  expecting  a  commission  check  soon  for  about  $26,000.  Without
touching  his  commission  check,  after  paying  his  regular  monthly  expenses,  such  as

savings, he currently has about $100,000 in his 401K.  He states that he always files his
annual income tax returns in a timely fashion.  Applicant earns sufficient monies to be
able to resolve all of his delinquent debts.
