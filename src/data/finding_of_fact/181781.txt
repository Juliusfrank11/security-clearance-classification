Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.j  with  explanations.  I  construe  his
answers to SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b as denials of intent to falsify his e-QIP. His admissions
are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 40 years old. He graduated from high school in 2000. (GE 1) Motivated
to join the military after September 11, he enlisted in the Marine Corps, and served on
active duty for four years (2003-2007). He served two tours in combat in Iraq and was
discharged honorably. (GE 1; Tr. 54-55) He was unemployed for about nine months in
2007-2008  before  taking  a  job  on  a  security  detail  in  the  Middle  East  for  a  defense
contractor. He spent much of the next three years working for defense contractors. (GE
1; Tr. 52-57)
Applicant  then  spent  a  year  (2011-2012)  working  in  retail.  He  was  then
unemployed for several years (2012-2016) while pursuing his bachelor’s degree, which
he  earned  in  2016.  (GE  1,  GE  2)  He  indicated  in  his  background  interview  that  he
supported himself with his pension and that the post-9/11 GI Bill paid for his education.
(GE 2 at 4)
Applicant  worked   for  an   insurance   company   for  a   few   months   in   2017   but  was
terminated after a physical altercation with a customer. (GE 1, GE 2) He was then briefly
unemployed  again until September 2017, when  he  began  working  for defense  contractor
C, his clearance sponsor. (Tr. 66-67; GE 14)  He was  released  in April 2020, shortly after
the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, because  he did not have a clearance. (Tr. 67,
132)  He was then  unemployed  for about a year. (Tr. 67, 125, 133)
Applicant began working for his current employer in April 2021. (Tr. 133-134) As
noted,  he  is  now  sponsored  for  a  public  trust  position.  He  has  an  annual  salary  of
$100,000. (Tr. 113-115) His wife works for a testing laboratory. She has a $63,000 annual
salary. (Tr. 116-117, 120) Applicant estimated that they have a combined a net monthly
income of $4,000. (Tr. 88-89)
AE  5  is  a  May  2022  e-mail  from  an  agency  of  the  AGD,  confirming  Applicant’s
“favorable adjudication” of his “eligibility for continued performance on the [AGD agency]
contract.” It also says “this notification does not constitute a security clearance.” (AE 5)
Applicant testified that he is working on this contract with his current employer.
Applicant  also  testified  that  he  is  a  disabled  veteran.  He  said  he  earns  90%
disability benefits, at $2,300 per month. (Tr. 88, 119) He testified that his disability related
to a variety of circumstances and conditions, including PTSD, insomnia, tinnitus, and a
combat incident involving blast wounds and shrapnel. (Tr. 119-120) He said he has not
participated  in  mental health  counseling,  other than  when  the  Department  of  Veterans
Affairs (VA) evaluated his injuries. He did have emergency room (ER) visits (as noted by
some  of  his  medical  debts).  (Tr.  130-131)  Applicant  did  not  provide  supporting
documentation of his disability status with the VA.
Applicant  married   his  second   wife   in   2019.  They   have   three   children   together,
including   a   newborn  infant  born   shortly   before  the   hearing.  Applicant   and   his first   wife
married  in  July  2005, and  separated  in  June  2007.  He said  they  divorced  in  2017. (Tr. 98-
99) The  marriage  produced  a  daughter  (D1), born in 2006, now  age  15. D1 lives with  her
mother  in  State   A.   Applicant  also   has   a   10-year-old  son   (S1),   born  in  2011   through
another relationship. S1  lives with his mother in State B. (Tr. 76-79)
The  SOR  debts  concern  past-due  child  support  of  over  $120,000,  as  well  as
multiple  medical  debts,  a  federal  student  loan,  and  some  phone  debts.  The  debts  are
listed on credit reports from October 2017 and April 2019. (GE 3, GE 4)
Applicant attributed his debts to his employment instability, depression, and PTSD
after he  returned from Iraq and the  Middle East.  He  said his life began  to  turn  around
when he moved to a new state, met his second wife, and returned to work as a contractor,
serving the national interest. (Tr. 58-61) Applicant acknowledged that he cannot afford to
be irresponsible, given his current family responsibilities. (Tr. 68-69)
By far the largest debts in the SOR relate to child support. SOR ¶ 1.f ($78,951) is
a debt to a child support agency in State C, where the mother of S1 used to live. (Tr. 79-
80, 83-84) GE 3 reflects that the account was opened in January 2008, and was reported
for collection in April 20176. (GE 3 at 3)
SOR  ¶ 1.a ($123,882) is a  child  support debt  through  State D,  where  Applicant
now lives. The figure alleged is taken from GE 4, an April 2019 credit report, but it is also
listed on GE 3 ($119,468). The account was opened in January 2008 and was reported
for collection in September 2017. (GE 3 at 3)
Applicant acknowledged that his child support debts became delinquent because
he  was  negligent  and irresponsible.  He  was  travelling,  often  overseas,  and  was  not  in
contact with the mothers of his two children. He said he took responsibility for the debts
once he returned to the United States. (Tr. 79, 105-107)
There  is  no  indication  that  Applicant  paid  any  child  support  for  either  D1  or  S1
when he was unemployed and in school (2012-2016) Applicant testified that S1’s mother
told him she intended to file for child support when S1 was about five or six years old, and
he acknowledged being negligent in response. (Tr. 122-124) Applicant testified that he
did not receive a court order for child support for S1. (Tr. 122-124) He said he took action
to address the child support for S1 in 2017. (Tr. 105-106)
In his background interview,  Applicant said  child  support for S1  was finalized  in
December 2016 and was finalized for D1 in December 2017. He said he paid $603.14
biweekly  through  his  pay.  (GE  2  at  6)  (Which  child  referenced  here  in  the  interview
summary is unclear, but is likely S1). There are no documents in the record from State B
regarding either Applicant’s child support requirements or payments to the mother of S1
when she lived there. (regarding SOR ¶ 1.f)
In  October 2017, Applicant was ordered  by  State  A  to  pay  $903  per month  in child
support to  the  mother of  D1.  (AE  2  at  7, 9)  In  May  2021,  Applicant  notified  the  State  A
court of a  change  in income  because  he  had  been  unemployed  since  April 2020. He  noted
that he  had  to  pay  child  support from  another relationship (S1) in  the  amount  of  $572. (AE
2  at  13) He  noted  child  support obligations through  State  D for two  children  (D1  and  S1,
presumably) of  $1,475  a  month, with  a  total balance  due  of  $132,256. (AE  2  at  14)  ($903
+ 572 = $1,475)  (AE 2; Tr. 102-103, 124-126, 134-135)
In  his  hearing  testimony,  however,  Applicant  testified  that  he  “didn’t  do  a
modification. I stayed with the current amount as if I was [still working with contractor C]
as in good faith thinking that I was going to go ahead and, you know, I’ll find employment
later, or soon enough.” (Tr. 67-68)
Applicant also testified that he did not miss any child support payments due to his
unemployment  in  2020-2021.  (Tr.  67-68)  He  appears  to  have  been  unemployed  from
about April 2020 to April 2021. During this period, in fact, he  was required to pay $903
per month to D1’s mother. AE 3 reflects that he missed several payments, either in part
or in full, until he regained employment and resumed making full payments (or more, for
arrearages) in September 2021. (AE 3 at 3-7)
Similarly, AE 4 reflects that Applicant missed several payments either in full ($572)
or in part, during this period of unemployment until September 2021, when full payments
resumed. (AE 4 at 2-4)
Applicant also acknowledged that he also only began paying child support for D1
in 2017. (Tr. 104) There are no documents in the record regarding his payments before
July 2019 for either D1 or S1.
AE 3 shows State D’s documentation of child support payments for S1 since July
1, 2019. As of July 1, 2019, Applicant owed a balance of $42,444 in child support for D1.
He generally owed $903 in monthly child support for D1. From July 2019 to May 2020,
Applicant  generally  made  his  required  payment,  plus  some  arrearage  payments.  For
some subsequent months, he has made the full payment, and for other months he has
not. (AE 3)
Since June 2020 Applicant’s arrearage balances generally increased, with limited
exceptions. Each month also reflects interest charges, initially of $139 per month, now up
to over $320 per month. As of June 29, 2022, Applicant owed $38,661 in arrearages, and
$25,240 in interest, for a total of $63,901 for D1. (AE 3)
AE 4 shows State D’s documentation of child support payments for S1 since July
1, 2019. Some months show payments in full and some show partial payments. Most of
the months show an increase in arrearages. As of July 1, 2019, Applicant owed a balance
of $82,063. It has now increased to $84,902. (AE 4) Applicant now owes almost $150,000
in child support arrears and interest. (AE 3, AE 4)
Credit  reports  from  April  2019  and  May  2022  show  Applicant’s  child  support
account in State A as closed with a zero balance. (GE 3; AE 1 at 25) No SOR debt is
specifically linked to this account.
Applicant  believes  his  remaining  SOR  debts  are  resolved.  (Tr.  126)  Several  of
them  are  past-due  medical  debts,  all  related  to  emergency  room  (ER)  visits.  These
include  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  ($637),  1.c  ($630),  1.d  ($430),  1.e  ($394), and  1.i  ($228)  (GE  4).
Applicant testified and reported in his answer that he believes these debts have all been
paid. (Tr. 81-87; Answer) He provided no documentation of these payments.
SOR ¶ 1.g ($3,244) is a federal student loan debt in collection. (GE 3) Applicant
said he has been paying that debt since 2019 at $687 a month. He believes the debt is
resolved. (Answer; Tr. 84-85, 90-92) He provided no documentation of these payments.
SOR ¶ 1.h ($889) is a cell-phone bill placed for collection. (GE 3) Applicant said in
his answer that the account was over 10 years old and had been dropped from his credit
report and had been paid. (Tr. 85-87; Answer) The debt is not reflected on a recent credit
report (AE 1), but he provided no documentation.
SOR ¶ 1.i ($537) is a cell-phone bill placed for collection. (GE 3) Applicant believes
the account has been closed and paid. (Tr. 87) He provided no documentation.
Applicant said he has not participated in credit counseling. (Tr. 131) A May 2022
credit report indicates no delinquencies, and he said he has no other known debts. (AE
1; Tr. 89) He estimated a monthly remainder of about $2,000. (Tr. 88)
Under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  allegedly  falsified  his
September 2017 e-QIP in failing to disclose either his federal debt or his child support
debt  (SOR  ¶  2.a) or  his various other  charged-off  debts  and  debts in  collection,  current
delinquencies, or other routine  debts (SOR ¶  2.b), as required. He answered  “No” to  all
the  financial questions  on the  e-QIP. (GE 1  at 52-53)
However, in the Comments section of GE 1, Applicant wrote:
I have  further documents and  letters from  individuals and  organizations that
helped  me  mitigate  all  my  current debts and  issues from  my  past.  I hope  all
the   necessary   documentation   given   on   my   behalf   would  suffice.   I  have
taken  responsibility  for my  debts and  have  been  making  payments towards
them. Thank you  for your time and patience in my clearance. (GE 1 at 55)
Applicant  said  that  the  last  time  he  prepared  an  e-QIP  or  security  clearance
application  before 2017  was  in  about  2010 or 2011,  after he  returned from  the  Middle
East. (Tr. 94-95, 130) Much of the information in the 2017 e-QIP was prepopulated. “So
when it said, ‘no’, I just went over it and [said] ‘no.” And that’s when I made that comment.”
(Tr. 95) Applicant acknowledged negligence “because I didn’t update that thinking that it
was already populated – auto-populated already.” (Tr. 130) He said he “skipped over a
lot of things. . . all I did was update my address, my residence because I was travelling
…” (Tr. 62-63)
Applicant testified  that he  did  not know  that his federal student loan  debt  (SOR ¶
1.g) was delinquent  when  he  submitted  his 2017  e-QIP. He  said  he  had  been  attending
community  college  and  had  a  student  loan. He did not attend  the  full  course,  so  he  had
to repay the loan, which he did not do. (Tr. 90-91)
Applicant acknowledged delinquencies, but testified that he did not know what type
of debts they were. He acknowledged that he had child support debts, but said he did not
know he owed “that much,” and said he did not know of any arrearage. He did not review
his  financial  record  for  verification.  He  said  he  did  not  know  about  his  debts  until  the
investigator showed him his credit report. (Tr. 71-74, 92-93, 97, 107, 128-129)
The child support order in State A is dated October 2017, shortly after Applicant
began working for defense contractor C. October 2017 is also the date of his credit report
pulled  in  connection  with  his  2017  background  investigation.  Applicant  testified  that
shortly after the court order for $903 a month in child support owed to the mother of D1,
his wages were placed under a garnishment order. (Tr. 109)
Applicant acknowledged under questioning that he knew before October 2017 that
he owed child support that he was not paying. (Tr. 110) He acknowledged that he did not
list his child support debt on his application. When asked why not, he said thought child
support was already listed on his 2017  e-QIP because of  what was listed on his 2010
application, though he acknowledged he did not update it in 2017 as he should have. (Tr.
110-111) (Applicant’s 2010 application is not in evidence).
Applicant listed both D1 (born in 2006) and S1 (born in 2011) as his  children on
his September 2017 application. (GE 1 at 36-37, 40) He acknowledged that S1’s mother
told him she intended to file for child support when S1 was about five or six years old (in
about 2017, or earlier). He said he did not receive a court order for child support for S1.
(Tr. 122-124). However, he acknowledged being negligent in response, and said he knew
he had child support for S1 that he had not paid. (Tr. 122-124)
In Applicant’s first background interview, he was asked whether, in the past seven
years,  he  was  delinquent  on  alimony  or  child  support.  He  answered  “Yes,”  an  answer
noted  as  “discrepant”  due  to  “oversight”  (GE  2  at  6)  In  discussing  the  status  of  child
support for both of his children, he said child support for S1 was finalized in December
2016  and  was  finalized  for  D1  in  December  2017.  He  said  he  paid  $603.14  biweekly
through his pay. (GE 2 at 6)
Applicant’s background interview resumed two days later. At the  beginning of that
interview, he  was confronted  with  various specific debts on  his credit  report,  including  the
debts at SOR ¶¶  1.g, 1.h, and  the  specifics of  the  child  support debt at SOR ¶¶  1.a  and
1.f.  (GE   2   at   9)   He also   brought  child   support documents   to   his second   interview.  (Tr.
112-114; GE  2  at 11) Those  documents  are referenced  in  Applicant’s  interview  summary
but are not in evidence.
Witness M is a longtime government contractor. She worked with Applicant on a
military contract. They met in June 2019, and travelled together for work on assignments
several  weeks  long.  She  has  not  seen  Applicant  since  Feb  2020.  She  attested  to  his
judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and honesty. She feels he is a hero, an honorable
man, and a “stand up” individual. (Tr. 25-33)
Witness  W  is  a  retired  U.S.  Army  master  sergeant  with  24  years’  active  duty
service.  He  is  now  with  contractor  C,  Applicant’s  former  employer.  He  has  held  a
clearance  for  many  years.  He  and  Applicant  were  co-workers.  He  trained  with  and
travelled  with  Applicant.  W  regards  Applicant  as  an  outstanding  coworker.  He  has  no
concerns about granting him a clearance, and regards him as reliable and trustworthy.
(Tr. 34-43)
Witness D is a retired Army colonel.  He works for an Army contactor.  Applicant
and D worked together in a training capacity. They had professional and social interaction.
He regards Applicant as reliable and capable. (Tr. 44-51)
