In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.l,
1.m,  1.n,  1.q,  1.r,  1.t,  1.u,  1.x,  1.y,  1.cc,  1.dd,  1.ee,  and  1.ff.  (HE  3)  He  denied  the
remaining SOR allegations. (Id.) He also provided mitigating information. His admissions
are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 54-year-old information technology technical support problem solver,
and he has been working for his current employer since September 2020. (Tr. 23, 25, 74)
In 1986, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 105)  In  2005, he  received  an  associate’s
degree. (GE 1 at 11) In 2014, he received a bachelor’s degree. (Id.) In 2016, he received
a master’s degree in business administration, strategy, and leadership. (Tr. 105; AE H)
In 2018, he received a master’s degree in business administration, entrepreneurship, and
innovation.  (Tr.  105;  GE  1  at  12;  AE  H)  He  is  working  on  his  Ph.D.  in  business
administration. (Tr. 21-22; AE K) He has never served in the U.S. military. (GE 1 at 19) In
1990, he married, and his children were born in 1997 and 1999. (Tr. 22, 104; GE 1 at 22,
25-26) His spouse is a special education teacher. (Tr. 58) She does not get paid in the
summer. (Tr. 74)
Applicant’s daughter graduated from college one year ago, and his son graduated
from college two years ago. (Tr. 80) Applicant paid or borrowed funds for their college
educations. (Tr. 77-80) His daughter’s income from her employment is low, and Applicant
is paying for a recreational vehicle in which she lives. (Tr. 77) His son is autistic; however,
he was able to graduate from college. (Tr. 77-78) His son is unable to find employment,
and Applicant provides financial support for him. (Tr. 78)
Financial Considerations
All of the debts on the SOR are owed to the same medical creditor, and the SOR
creditor used a single collection agent. Applicant had medical insurance for at least the
previous five years, and when he had a surgery, the medical insurance only paid for part
of surgery or test charges. (Tr. 107) He was billed for the remainder. (Tr. 107-108) He
was unsure about the annual cap on charges in his insurance policy. (Tr. 107) He did not
provide a copy of his medical insurance policy.
Applicant  paid  a  law  firm  $129  monthly  since  about  2019  or  2020,  to  verify  or
dispute  negative  entries  on  his  credit  report  based  on  the  Fair  Credit  Reporting  Act
(FCRA).  (Tr.  27,  108,  113-114)  Applicant  provided  documentation  from  the  law  firm
covering the period from January 2021 to present and listing the accounts the law firm
challenged. (AE O at 1-52) He also provided sample letters from the law firm to creditors
asking for verification information from the creditors and disputing negative credit report
entries. (AE O) For example, from January 2022 to July 2022, the law firm sent letters on
19 different dates challenging 76 negative credit report account entries, including some
that were unrelated to the SOR debts. (AE O) The reason Applicant employed the law
firm was to improve his credit score. (Tr. 110-111) He provided sample letters from the
law firm. (AE O) When a negative entry was removed from a credit report, the law firm
did not provide the reason for the deleted information. (AE M) The debt could be deleted
for  a  variety  of  reasons.  (Id.)  He  also  pays  the  law  firm  $129  monthly  to  dispute  his
daughter’s medical debts. (Tr. 112) When the law firm told him a debt owed to the SOR
creditor was successfully disputed, he contacted the SOR creditor, and the SOR creditor
advised him that he did not owe the debt. (Tr. 116) He did not know why the debts were
deleted except in the instances where he paid the debts. (AE M)
In  2010,  a  spider  bit  Applicant,  and  he  had  a  MRSA  infection.  (Tr.  40)  He  was
hospitalized  for  30  days,  and  his  bill  was  about  $22,000;  however,  his  insurance  paid
most of the bill. (Tr. 41) He used up the funds in his accounts to pay his medical bills. (Tr.
42-43)
Applicant’s October 28, 2015 credit report shows 36 accounts totaling $163,233,
and all accounts are paid as agreed or with zero balances or both, except for eight medical
debts in collections totaling $1,721 for the following amounts: $492; $260; $249; $249;
$150; $150; $121; and $50. (GE 3 at 11-13) None of the eight accounts in collection are
on his November 28, 2020 credit report or listed on the SOR. (HE 2; GE 4)
From 2016 to 2018, Applicant received treatments for his diabetes and liver. (Tr.
41-43) In 2018, he had surgery under general anesthesia. (Tr. 39) He lost his employment
in 2019, at least in part because of his illnesses and an inability to travel. (Tr. 97-98) His
company put him on disability status, and for about two months in late 2019, he was not
paid. (Tr. 99-100) He used credit cards to live. (Tr. 100) After losing his job in 2019, his
employment was sporadic until he received his current employment. (Tr. 101)
In 2018, Applicant had two atrial cardiac ablations, and the hospital had two nurse
anesthetists and one anesthesiologist for the surgeries. (HE 3 at 1) The anesthesiology
bills are in SOR ¶¶ 1.a for $3,023, 1.b for $2,841, and 1.e for $1,804. (Id.) Applicant said
the creditor advised him that he is no longer responsible for these three debts. (Id.) He
disputed  these  debts  on  his  credit  report.  (Id.)  He  also  had  a  12-lead  EKG  and  an
echocardiogram after each cardiac ablation, and they were billed in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d
for $2,793 and $2,264, respectively. (Id.) SOR ¶ 1.t for $150 was for a separate 12-lead
EKG and echocardiogram in relation to a possible cardiac ablation. (Id. at 2) SOR ¶ 1.y
for $96 was for a post-surgery office visit. (Id. at 3) Applicant said the SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d,
1.t, and 1.y debts were his responsibility. (Id. at 1-3)
SOR  ¶¶  1.f  for  $1,467  and  1.g  for  $1,309  related  to  the  anesthesiology  for  two
colonoscopies. (HE 3 at 1) The creditor agreed that Applicant did not have to pay these
two debts, and he disputed their presence on his credit report. (Id.)
SOR ¶ 1.h for $1,144 was for an endoscopy done under anesthesiology to band
esophageal varices from complications related to stage 2 non-alcoholic cirrhosis of his
liver. (HE 3 at 1) Applicant said he did not owe this debt. (Id.)
SOR  ¶   1.q   for $163   was  for  an   office   visit  to   a   surgeon   to   assess  the   need   for
surgery  to  repair  a  severe anal fistula.  (HE  3  at 2)  SOR ¶ 1.i for $1,030  was for general
surgery. SOR ¶¶  1.j for $706,  1.k for $684, and  1.z  for $85  were for anesthesiology  to
repair  a  severe anal fistula.  (HE  3  at 1-3)  SOR ¶¶  1.r for $162, 1.s for $158, 1.v  for $139,
1.x  for $108, and  1.bb  for $77  were for wound  care after the  fistula  surgery. (Id. at 2-3)
He received  follow-up  wound  care  15  to  20  times on  a  weekly  basis  for several months.
(Id.  at 1-2) Applicant said he  did  not owe  the  debts  in  SOR ¶¶  1.i, 1.j, 1.k,  1.s,  1.v, 1.z,
and  1.bb;  however, he  accepted  responsibility  for  three  debts  in SOR  ¶¶  1.q,  1.r,  and  1.x.
(Id.  at 2-3)
SOR ¶ 1.l for $515 was for a colonoscopy /C polypectomy via Snare (Hot), which
was used to remove about 12 pre-cancerous polyps. (HE 3 at 2) It was done under light
(Id.)  Applicant  accepted
general  anesthesiology
responsibility for this debt. (Id.)
including  ventilator  support.
SOR ¶¶ 1.m for $318 and 1.u for $150 were for Iron/Platelet infusions. (HE 3 at 2)
Applicant said he has had about 15 of these infusions on a weekly basis. (Id. at 2) He
accepted responsibility for these two debts. (Id.)
SOR ¶ 1.n for $264 was for an emergency room visit for lower leg cellulitis that

about one week for IV antibiotics and further diagnostic procedures. (Id.) Upon discharge,
he received six weeks of continuous at-home antibiotics through a PIC line. (Id.) Applicant

SOR  ¶  1.o  for  $196  was  for  an  emergency  room  visit  for  chest  pain  and
supraventricular tachycardia. (HE 3 at 2) SOR ¶ 1.aa for $80 was for an overnight sleep
study to determine whether there was a connection with his atrial fibrillation. (HE 3 at 3)
SOR ¶¶ 1.cc for $68, 1.dd for $68, 1.ee for $68, and 1.ff for $60 were for four consultations
with specialists in relation to his diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, and Applicant was referred
to a cardiologist for further care. (Id. at 2-3) Applicant said he no longer owes the debt in
SOR ¶ 1.o; however, he accepted responsibility for the four debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.cc, 1.dd,
1.ee, and 1.ff. (Id. at 3)
SOR ¶ 1.p for $193 was for an EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) to monitor
and  remove  (band)  esophageal  varices.  (HE  3  at  2)  It  was  done  under  light  general
anesthesia. (Id.) Applicant said he no longer owes this debt. (Id.)
SOR ¶  1.w  for $119  was for a  telehealth  call  to  discuss  Applicant’s liver disease.
(HE 3 at 3) Applicant said he no longer owes this debt. (Id.)
In  the  November  2,  2020  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  he  had  $19,966  in  medical
debts resulting from surgery and other professional services in 2015, and he said he was
working with the collection agent to pay this debt. (GE 1 at 36)  He said he was paying
$25 to $100 every few weeks. (Id. at 37) None of the medical debts from 2015 are listed
on his current SOR.
The October 1, 2021 SOR alleges 32 delinquent medical debts totaling $22,302
owed  to  the  same  collection  agent.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  received  the  medical
services that resulted in the SOR debts. (Tr. 67) He  provided a list of 21 bills from the
creditor totaling $12,583: $103; $163; $96; $219; $1,854; $68; $60; $60; $2,793; $2,305;
$318; $61; $68; $2,264; $68; $2,264; $828; $150; $150; $264; and $515. (AE B) Applicant
believed that these 21 debts were all that he owed to the creditor. (Tr. 44) The creditor’s
letter  indicates  Applicant  paid  four  medical  debts  for  $20,  $162,  $109,  and  $103  for
medical  services  received  in  2019  and  2021.  (Tr.  46-47;  AE  B)  The  creditor  asked
Applicant to pay off one or two of the smaller medical debts every month. (Tr. 47)
The following table shows the list of debts owed to the same creditor from three
credit reports and a statement from the creditor, AE B. The creditor’s statement indicated
8 of 21 debts on  the  creditor’s list were not listed  on  the  SOR, and 13 of the 21 debts
were listed on the SOR. The  creditor’s statement said the total was $12,583; however,
the column total in the following table is $14,671. (AE B)

Applicant  believed  the  legitimate  medical  debts  were  listed  on  AE  B  and  the
incorrect debts were not. (Tr. 53-54) The medical debts on AE B resulted from medical
treatments he received in 2017, 2018, and 2019, and those debts were his responsibility.
(Tr. 50-53) He did not make payments for a time because the SOR creditor wanted to
consolidate the debts, and for him to make large payments. (Tr. 109-110) Recently, the
SOR creditor agreed that he could pay off the smaller medical debts first, which enabled
him to pay six debts. (Tr. 110) He made the following payments to the SOR creditor: May
12, 2022 ($80); May 20, 2022 ($60); June 3, 2022 ($69); June 15, 2022 ($69); July 5,
2022 ($36); and July 15, 2022 ($69). (Tr. 54-55, 70; AE I; AE N) Over the last two years,
he made about $380 in payments to the creditor. (Tr. 71)
Applicant gave a higher priority to paying his credit card debts  than his medical
debts because he was not being charged interest on his medical debts and some credit
cards were charging up to 30 percent interest. (Tr. 109) According to the most recent list
he received from the SOR creditor, he owed the medical creditor $13,321 for 20 debts for
services received from 2017 to 2021 in the following amounts: $199; $250; $250; $250;
$199; $250; $250; $163; $97; $1,904; $226; $2,793; $2,366; $318; $2,264; $852; $150;
$150; $515; and $196. (Tr. 45, 68; AE N) Most of the debts that were deleted from his
credit report were due to the challenges from the law firm he hired to dispute debts and
not through Applicant paying the debts. (Tr. 68) The creditor is satisfied with his current
payment plans. (Tr. 79)
Applicant has had  credit  counseling.  (Tr. 60-61; AE D) His budget indicates net
income of $8,684; and expenses of $7,582. (Tr. 71-72; AE J) He has $800 in his checking
account and $3,400 in his savings account. (Tr. 81) His budget does not fully reflect his
payments to support his son. (Tr. 79) He is trying to save for his retirement. He budgeted
$100 monthly to pay the SOR creditor. (AE J) He believes he can pay about $200 a month
in the future towards his medical debts. (Tr. 47-48, 59) Despite his medical problems, he
kept his mortgage and other financial accounts in a current status. (Tr. 62) Since he began
his  current  employment  in  September  2020,  he  paid  off  several  credit  cards  with  low
balances and a signature loan that he took out in 2015 to pay for his daughter’s education.
(Tr. 75)
Applicant’s  July  8,  2022  TransUnion  credit  report  shows  five  medical-collection
accounts (opened in 2018 and 2019) owed to the SOR creditor as follows: $1,804; $684;
$2,793; $1,467; and $2,264. (AE M; Pt. II, pages 101-102) His TransUnion credit report
also showed 41 satisfactory accounts. (AE M; Pt. II, page 104) His July 5, 2022 Experian
credit report shows seven medical-collection accounts (opened in 2017, 2018, and 2019)
owed to the SOR creditor as follows: $195; $2,264; $2,793; $318; $1,804; $1,467; and
$684. (AE M; Pt. II pages 126-129) His Experian credit report also showed 42 satisfactory
accounts.  (AE  M;  Pt.  II  page  131)  His  June  30,  2022  Equifax  credit  report  shows  16
medical-collection accounts (opened in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020) owed to the SOR
creditor as follows: $150; $1,467; $1,804; $2,264; $2,793; $162; $108; $85; $163; $684;
$96; $68; $318; $150; $195; and $193. (AE M; Pt. II pages 156-161) His Equifax credit
report also showed 39 satisfactory accounts. (AE M; Pt. II page 161)
Applicant has eight credit cards, and their balances are: $2,557; $3,026; $1,168;
$913; $2,538; $2,941; $517; and $450. (Tr. 82-90; GE 6) He has a 2016 F-250 truck and
a 2013 F-150 truck. (Tr. 95) In 2020, he purchased the used F-250 for $37,440, and it
was 100 percent financed. (Tr. 96) All of his credit cards are close to their maximum or
over the maximum due to the latest monthly payment not yet being made, and he makes
the minimum payments every month. (Tr. 82-83) His spouse has two credit cards. (Tr.
90)
Applicant has a significant amount of equity in his home, and he intends to take
out a home-equity loan at about a 5.6 percent interest rate which he can use to pay off
his truck, his recreational vehicle  where  his daughter lives,  six of  his  credit  cards, and
apply  $11,000  towards  the  debts  owed  to  the  SOR  creditor.  (Tr.  73-74,  77,  102)  His
monthly interest payments will be reduced about $450. (Tr. 103) When his student loans
come out of deferment, his monthly payment will be $1,200. (Tr. 93) He is current on his
state and federal income taxes. (Tr. 94)
Applicant’s plan  is to  pay  his debts and  establish  his financial responsibility. (Tr.
111)  When the school year begins, he and his wife will have additional income, and they
will be able to  make their student loan  payments.
Character Evidence
The  vice  president  of  the  company  where  Applicant  is  employed  has  known
Applicant for 12 years and currently supervises him. (Tr. 33) He described Applicant as
an  exceptional  employee  who  is  diligent,  trustworthy,  responsible,  competent,  and
honest. (Tr. 33-38) He volunteers in his community, and he is passionate about caring for
his family and contributing to the success of his company. (Tr. 65-66)
Applicant provided six character statements from friends, coworkers, supervisors,
and his spouse. (AE G) The general sense of their statements is that Applicant is honest,
responsible,  diligent,  trustworthy,  helpful,  generous,  professional,  and  reliable.  Their
statements support continuation of his security clearance.
