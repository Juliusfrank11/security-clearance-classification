Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $51,262 for 11
delinquent  or  past-due  debts  (SOR  1.a  –  1.k).  In  response,  Applicant  admitted  with
explanations  all  of  the  allegations.  (Answer)  In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by
Applicant’s admissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact.
Applicant  is  47  years  old.  He  enlisted  in  the  United  States  Marine  Corps  in
November 1995 and retired as a staff sergeant in December 2015. Thereafter, he worked
for a federal contractor until August 2019. Between September 2019 and August 2020,
he was unemployed except for two months, when he worked as a landscaper and at a
retail store. He has worked for his current employer since September 2020. (GX 1; GX 3;
Tr. 22 – 26, 32)
Applicant first received a security clearance after he entered on active duty in 1995.
In March 2015, he submitted an e-QIP to renew that clearance. The ensuing background
investigation produced information that supports all of the SOR allegations. The debts at
issue became delinquent between 2014 and 2018. Only one debt (SOR 1.c) has been
paid; however, that debt was for a delinquent military exchange system credit card that
was  resolved  involuntarily  when  the  creditor  garnished  the  past-due  amount  from
Applicant’s retired pay. (GX 3 – 6; Tr. 48)
Applicant has been married three times. He and his current wife were married in
July 2009 and have two minor children together. He attributes his financial problems to
what  he  claims  was  his  wife’s  financial  malfeasance  while  he  was  deployed  overseas
between August 2010 and May 2011. He claims she abused a general power of attorney
he gave her before he deployed. He avers she drained their bank accounts and ran up
numerous debts that went unpaid. She then took their (at the time only) child and moved
to another state near her mother. Upon his return from deployment, Applicant reconciled
with his wife and she returned to their home near his duty station. Thereafter, they had
their second child; however, they again separated in 2016. As of the hearing, neither had
filed for divorce, but Applicant has recently contacted a law firm to pursue filing. (Answer;
AX 2; Tr. 26 – 32, 57 – 58)
Aside  from  SOR  1.c,  discussed  above,  Applicant  has  not  paid  or  otherwise
resolved any of the delinquent debts attributed to him in the Government’s exhibits. In his
March 2021 response to the SOR, he indicated his expectation that the debts at SOR 1.a,
1.b, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i would fall off his credit report after seven years because they have
been charged off as business losses. As to SOR 1.j and 1.k, he stated his intention to
resolve those debts by May 2021, but acknowledged at hearing that he had not yet paid
them.  He  further  stated  that  the  SOR  1.g  debt,  the  remainder  after  resale  of  a  car
repossession, was the responsibility of his estranged wife. Although it appears in one of
his  credit  reports as  a  joint  account,  he  did not  present  any  information  to  support his
claim. (Answer; Tr. 35 – 41)
Finally, he thought he had paid the medical bills alleged at SOR 1.d and 1.e, but
he has no proof of that claim. According to a 2020 credit report, those debts were first
reported  as  delinquent  in  2018.  They  do  not  appear  on  a  2021  credit  report.  Absent
additional  information  from  the  Applicant,  the  status  of  these  debts  is  unclear  in  this
record. (GX 4 – 6; Tr. 41)
Applicant testified that he does not intend to pay for any debts that he feels are his
wife’s responsibility. SOR 1.a is the only debt listed as a joint account. He did not provide
any information that shows she is responsible for any of the debts in the SOR. As of the
hearing, he planned to list all of his debts in a petition for divorce (not yet filed) so that
responsibility for the debts could be shared with his wife. (GX 5; Tr. 49 – 51)
In addition to the income Applicant receives for his work as a defense contractor,
he receives disability pay from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and his retired
military pay. Most of his retired pay is allocated to his wife for the support of their children.
After paying his regular monthly expenses, he has as much as $3,000 remaining each
month. He does not use that money to pay off any of his past-due debts, choosing instead
to spend his extra money on other things. (Tr. 34, 42 – 45, 54 – 55)
