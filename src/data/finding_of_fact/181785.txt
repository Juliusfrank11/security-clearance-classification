In  his  answer,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  allegations  ¶¶  1.c-1.e  and  1.g,  and  he
denied ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i. His admissions are incorporated into my findings of
fact. Based on my review of the pleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make
the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  52   years  old.   He  was  married   in  1992,  and   has   one   adult  son.  He
served  on  active  duty  in the  United  States Marine  Corps  from  1989  –   1993, and  in  the
U.S. Army  from  1994  –  2010.  His service included  overseas deployments in  a  combat
zone. He is now  retired  from the  military. Applicant has been  consistently  employed  since
2012. His only  period  of unemployment was for three  months in  2011.  Since  2013,  he  has
worked  for a defense contractor as a technical support engineer.  (Tr. 17-21;  GE 2)
The SOR alleges failure to timely file  federal and state income tax returns, and
seven delinquent debts, totaling about $27,534. The status of the allegations is as follows:
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b allege that Applicant failed to timely file his 2016 and 2018
federal and state income tax returns. In his 2019 background interview with a government
investigator, he reported that he failed to file his 2016 income tax returns because he was
traveling for work at the time they were due, and then forgot about filing and paying them.
He told the investigator that he would file his 2016 return in 2019. Applicant provided a
different narrative at the hearing, he stated that his 2016 returns were filed on time, but
he did not submit payment  along with the filing. He did not provide any documentation
substantiating this. He also reported that he had an extension to file his 2018 returns, and
that he filed them in 2019.  He asserted that his tax return filings for the last five years
have  been  timely.  The  Government  did  not  submit  sufficient  evidence  to  show  that
Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  2018  federal  or  state  returns,  but  there  is  sufficient
evidence to find that he failed to timely file his 2016 federal and state returns. (Tr. 22-25;
44-49; GE 3)
SOR ¶ 1.c is a federal tax debt for $7,266 for tax year 2016. Applicant stated that
he contacted the IRS in 2019 to set up a payment plan. His tax account balance records
show that he has been making monthly payments of $200 to the IRS since November
2019, and the current balance for his 2016 tax debt is $1,975. (Tr. 22-24, 44-49; GE 3;
AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.d is a charged-off auto loan for $10,988. Applicant was unemployed for
three months in 2011, after the employment contract he was working on ended. He stated
that his next job paid less, and that he became unable to make his car loan payments. In
2012, his car was repossessed. This debt is unpaid. He did not address this debt until
2019,  when  he  made  a  settlement  offer  to  the  creditor.  However,  he  never  followed
through with any payments. (Tr. 27-29, 49-50; GE 2, 3, 5)
SOR ¶ 1.e is a charged-off auto loan for $3,634. Applicant purchased a car in 2013,
and it was totaled in an accident in 2016. While his car insurance covered the majority of
the loss, he claims that his gap insurance did not cover the difference. He claims that he
disputed the coverage with the gap insurance provider, but he did not provide sufficient
documentation of the dispute. This debt is unpaid. He did not address this debt until 2019,
when he made a settlement offer to the creditor. However, he never followed through with
any payments. (Tr. 29-32, 49-51; GE 3, 5, 6)
SOR ¶ 1.f is a debt in collection for cellular phone services for $2,007. Applicant
claimed that this debt resulted from his switch to another service provider in 2018.  He
claimed that he resolved this debt in 2020, but the settlement documentation he provided
is from 2022. This debt is now resolved. (Tr. 32-33, 51-52; GE 3, 5; AE B)
SOR ¶ 1.g is a charged-off account with a jewelry store for $1,702. The account
has been delinquent since 2018. Applicant claimed that this account was paid, but he did
not provide sufficient documentation to show that it has been resolved. (Tr. 33-36, 53; GE
5, 6; AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.h is a debt in collection for the Department of Veterans Affairs for $898.
It  has  been  delinquent  since  2012.  Applicant  thought  it  might  have  originated  as  an
overpayment.  In  his  testimony,  he  claimed  that  this  debt  was  paid  through  automatic
deduction from his military retirement pay. However, the post-hearing documentation he
provided  shows  a  settlement  agreement  for  this  debt  from  June  2022,  and  no
documentation showing that any payments had been made. (Tr. 37-39; 53-54; GE 3, 5,
6; AE D)
SOR ¶ 1.i is a debt in collection for cellular phone services for $1,039. Applicant
stated that he did not know why this debt became delinquent in 2017, and claims that he
paid  it  in  approximately  February  2020.  However,  he  did  not  provide  sufficient
documentation showing that it has been paid. (Tr. 39-41, 54; GE 3, 4, AE C)
In addition to the SOR debts, the record shows that Applicant owes the IRS $1,006
for his 2021 taxes. He claims that the IRS assessed this amount after filing his tax return.
He also has a $2,193 debt for his state taxes. He set up a payment arrangement for his
state taxes on May 31, 2022, but did not provide sufficient documentation showing that
he has made any payments towards this debt. (Tr. 22-25, 43-49; AE A, H)
Applicant stated that he earns about $90,000 annually. He reported that he does
not have a budget, and he failed to provide any information about his monthly expenses.
He asserted that he has chosen to pay his current expenses over his delinquent debts.
He claims that he does not have the means to resolve his bigger debts because he is
making $200 monthly payments on his tax debt. He also reported that he does not have
a savings account, but that has about $70,000 in his 401K account. (Tr. 41-43, 54 -58)
