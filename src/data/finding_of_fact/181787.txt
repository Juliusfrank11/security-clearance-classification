In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and
1.b, alleging that he failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years
2010 through 2016. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He worked for this
employer  as  a  shipfitter  from  October  2009  to  April  2017,  when  he  became  a  quality
inspector. He was promoted to a manager position in August 2021. (Tr. 21.) He has never
held a security clearance.
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  July  2007  and  attended  some  college
courses,  but  he  did  not  receive  a  degree.  He  is  currently  a  part-time  student,  working
toward a bachelor’s degree in business management. His educational expenses are paid
by his employer. (Tr. 16, 20-21.) He married in August 2014 and has two children and two
stepchildren, all of whom live with him and his wife.
As a shipfitter, Applicant earned around $40,000 per year. His pay increased to
about $60,000 to $70,000 per year when he became a quality inspector. As a manager,
he now earns about $75,000 to $80,000 per year. (Tr. 22-23.) Applicant’s wife is a nurse,
works part time, and earns $40,000 to $45,000 per year. (Tr. 26-27.) He estimates that
their net monthly remainder after paying all expenses is about $1,000 per month. (Tr. 29.)
Applicant and his wife own their home. They refinanced their home mortgage loan
in August 2021 for $226,000. (Tr. 30.) In March 2021, they purchased two used vehicles,
model years 2005 and 2008. In April 2022, they purchased another used vehicle. (Tr. 30-
31.) A credit report from June 2022 reflects no delinquent debts. (AX I.)
During  an  interview  with  a  security  investigator  in  November  2018,  Applicant
admitted  that  he  made  a  conscious  decision  in  2010  to  not file  his  income  tax  returns
because he could not afford to pay the taxes due. (GX 2 at 8.) He told the investigator
that he was working with a professional tax preparer but that the tax preparer could not
help him with the tax returns for 2010 through 2013. (GX 2 at 9.) In response to DOHA
interrogatories  in  December  2019,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  not  filed  his  federal
income tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2015. He estimated that he owed $1,864
for 2014 and $845 for 2015. He stated that he had filed his federal returns for 2016, 2017,
and 2018, and that he owed $1,483 for 2016 and was entitled to refunds for 2017 and
2018. (GX 2 at 27.)
In response to the same interrogatories, Applicant stated that he had filed his state
income tax return for 2010, but he provided no documentation to support his statement.
He  admitted  he  had  not  filed  his  state  returns  for  2011,  2012,  and  2013.  He  provided
documentation that he had filed his state returns for 2014 through 2018, but had not paid
the taxes due. His documentation does not reflect when the state returns for 2014 through
2018 were filed. (GX 2 at 47.)  He admitted owing state taxes of about $1,042, and he
provided documentation of a payment plan for his state taxes. (GX 2 at 43-46.) He also
provided documentation that a $719 refund was being applied to his tax debts for 2014,
2015, and 2017, leaving a balance due of $48.73. (AX H.)
At the hearing, Applicant presented documentary evidence that he filed his 2016
federal return in April 2019, had timely filed his 2017 federal return, had filed his 2018
federal return in October 2019 after receiving an extension of time, and timely  filed his
2019 federal return. (AX B-E.) He also submitted evidence that he had a payment plan in
place for his federal tax debt and that his tax debt was satisfied as of June 2022. (AX A,
F, and G.). He provided no evidence that he had filed his federal returns for 2010, 2011,
2012, and 2013.
Applicant attributed his failures to file his federal and state tax returns to numerous
factors.  He  was  arrested  for  DUI  in  June  2010  and  then  failed  to  appear  in  court  in
September 2010. (GX 2 at 5-6.) As a result, he incurred the cost of legal fees and higher
insurance rates. His mother and stepfather broke up while he was living with them. He
then lived with his grandparents from August 2010 to May 2013, when  he began living
with his girlfriend. (GX 1 at 8-9.) He fell behind on his debts. His car was repossessed
and his pay was garnished for delinquent student loans and credit-card debts. (GX 2 at
8.) After Applicant and his wife married in 2014, his wife told him he needed to get himself
together and start taking care of his obligations. (Tr. 17-19.)
Applicant testified that he and his wife were scheduled to meet with an IRS agent
in mid-July 2022 regarding the federal returns that have not yet been filed. (Tr. 46.) I held
the record open to enable him to submit additional documentation regarding his past-due
federal returns. He did not submit any further evidence.
