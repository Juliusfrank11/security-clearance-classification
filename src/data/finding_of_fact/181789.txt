approximately  $60,0000,  for  delinquent  accounts  that  have  either  been  placed  for
collection or charged off.  Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR.
Credit reports of the Applicant dated May 10, 2018; May 14, 2019; and January 7, 2021,

Applicant served in the U.S. Navy from 1992 to 1996, and received an honorable
discharge.  He  then  attended  a  University  from  1996  to  2000,  without  receiving  a
degree.  He rejoined the military, this time serving in the Army on active duty from 2005
to 2016, and is now in the reserves.  While in the Army, Applicant applied for a security
clearance, and it was denied due to financial issues.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  Applicant
got  married  in  2010,  and  divorced  in  2012.  Since  2016,  Applicant  has  lived  with  his
girlfriend, and they have one child born in 2014.
