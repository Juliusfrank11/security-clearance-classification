Applicant is 41 years old. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2002 and was medically
separated  under  Honorable  conditions  in  February  2013  at  the  pay  grade  of  E-7.  He
married in 2001 and has two children, ages 8 and 18. He and his wife separated in  or
about March 2015 and divorced in 2018. After his military discharge, Applicant pursued
a college education and obtained an associate’s degree in 2015. He earned a bachelor’s
degree in May 2018. He was unemployed while he attended his undergraduate classes
and was financially supported by disability benefits from the U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA). He is presently taking post-graduate courses in pursuit of a master’s degree.
He began working for a Defense Department contractor in 2018 and was employed as a
research associate. In 2020 he began working for a different Government contractor as
a research coordinator. Applicant held a clearance while serving in the Army. He is now
seeking to obtain a security clearance in relation to his employment. (Tr. at 10-11, 20-22,
24-25; GE 1 at 13, 21; GE 2 at 1.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is
financially  overextended  with  delinquent  debts  and  therefore  is  potentially  unreliable,
untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
The  SOR  identifies  seven  charged-off  or  past-due  debts  in  collection  owed  by
Applicant  totaling  about  $39,000.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  two  of  the  SOR
allegations. The existence and amounts of these debts is also supported by credit reports
in the record dated March 12, 2020; May 21, 2019; and February 9, 2018. (GE 4-6.)
The current status of the debts set forth in the SOR is as follows:
1.a.  Debt charged off in the approximate amount of $14,774. Applicant denied this
debt in the Answer. In August 2013, Applicant borrowed funds to purchase a vehicle after
his discharge from the Army. He was unemployed and in about March 2014 he could not
afford the loan payments. The vehicle was voluntarily repossessed. He claimed that he
was advised in writing that he owed nothing further on the debt.  Applicant testified that
the document was destroyed with much of his personal property in a hurricane. He was
advised  about  this  outstanding  debt  on  his  credit  report  at  his  July  2018  background
interview.  When  he  received  the  SOR,  he  saw  that  the  debt  remained  an  unresolved
security concern. He has taken no further action because he believed that he does not
owe anything on this loan. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 34-38; GE 2 at 7; GE 4 at 1;
GE 5 at 1; GE 6 at 3.)
1.b. Debt charged off in the approximate amount of $11,400.  Applicant incurred
this debt to purchase a car for his then-wife. He could not afford to continue the make the
payments, and he surrendered the car to the lender. The original amount of the loan was
about $46,000. The loan was charged off in the amount of $27,000. When he returned
the  vehicle  in  2014,  he  did  not  believe  that  he  owed  anything  further  on  the  loan.  He
learned about the debt during his background interview in 2018 and again in the SOR.
He has no documentation to show that the debt was fully repaid with the return of the car.
He has taken no further steps to resolve the debt since he returned the vehicle. This debt
is not resolved. (Tr. at 41-43; GE 2 at 7; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 3.)
1.c. Debt charged off in the approximate amount of $6,633. This debt is for a third
auto  loan.  According  to  the  credit  reports in the  record,  Applicant  took  out  this  loan  in
2012 and stopped paying on the loan in 2013. In his background interview, he recognized
the debt as his loan for a car he purchased in 2012. At the hearing, he testified that he
disputed this debt because he never had a third vehicle. He believed this debt is not his
obligation. He suggested that it could be his father’s debt since their names are almost
identical. He has no documentation to support his claim that the debt is not his liability.
The  credit  reports  reflect  that  he  stopped  paying  on  this  loan  in  June  2013  before  he
purchased in August 2013 the car with the loan discussed in 1.a, above. The Government
established by substantial evidence that this debt is owed by Applicant. This debt is not
resolved. (Tr. at 45-47; GE 2 at 6-7; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 3.)
1.d. Medical collection debt in the approximate amount of $952. Applicant admitted
this  debt  in  the  Answer.  His  statement  in  his  Answer  that  he  is  “currently  mak[ing]
payments on this [debt]” is incorrect. He testified that he personally visited a nearby VA
hospital about this bill, and he believes that the VA has taken responsibility for the debt.
He has no documentation to support this belief. This debt remains on the Government’s
most recent credit report in the record. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 26-30; GE 4 at 2;
GE 5 at 2.)
1.e.  Debt  charged  off  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $3,089.  This  debt  is  for  a
payday  loan  Applicant  incurred  a  number  of  years  ago.  He  admitted  the  debt  in  the
Answer.  He  testified  that  he  paid  the  debt  for  a  period  and  then  he  stopped  receiving
correspondence from the creditor. He wrote in the Answer that he  “assumed [the loan]
was paid off.” He added that he would follow up with the creditor. He called the creditor
and was  advised  that the debt  was  resolved.  He  received  nothing in  writing. When he
received  the  Government’s  evidence  in  May  or  June  2021,  he  learned  that  the  debt
remained on his credit report. He has taken no further steps to resolve this old debt. This
debt is not resolved.  (Tr. at 30-33; GE 2 at 7; GE 6 at 4.)
1.f. Collection debt in the approximate amount of $1,374. This debt arose out of a
December  2011  payday  loan  that  Applicant  defaulted  on  in  approximately  December
2012. He was experiencing serious financial problems at that time. He has done nothing
since 2012 to repay this loan. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 48-51; GE 2 at 7; GE 5 at
2; GE 6 at 4.)
1.g Collection debt in the approximate amount of $1,128. This debt is for a gym
membership that became delinquent in August 2017. Applicant disputed this debt in the
Answer claiming that he never had a gym membership. When he learned about the debt
during his background interview, he called the gym and advised the creditor that he was
never a member. He mailed the gym a copy of a bill to show the creditor that he lived in
another  state.  The  debt  appears  on  a  credit  report  submitted  by  the  Government.
Applicant provided no documentation in support of his claimed dispute. This debt is not
resolved. (Tr. at 51-55; GE 2 at 7; GE 6 at 8.)
Mitigation
Applicant has provided little evidence in mitigation of the security concerns raised
by  his  financial  delinquencies.  He  testified  that  he  has  purchased  a  home  and  new
vehicles, but he provided no budgetary information that would support a conclusion that
he is presently living within his means and has the financial ability to repay his delinquent
debts. (Tr. at 10.)
