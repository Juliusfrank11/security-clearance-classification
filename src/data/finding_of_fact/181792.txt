In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR allegations, SOR ¶¶ 1.a
through  1.k;  and  2.a  and  2.b.  In  his  SOR  response,  he  also  provided  mitigating
information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Background Information
Applicant  is  a   32-year-old  warehouse   specialist,   who   has  been   employed   by   a
defense   contractor   since   September   2018.   This  is  his  first   application   for  a   security

Financial Considerations
The SOR lists 11 allegations under this concern. SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.k allege
various debts, all of  which are discussed in further detail below. These allegations are
established by his March  4, 2020 SF-86, his June  26, 2020, December 15,  2020, and
March  31,  2022  credit  reports;  his  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  Report  of
Investigation conducted from July 2, 2020 to July 14, 2020 to include an OPM Personal
Subject Interview (PSI) on July 9, 2020; and his September 3, 2021 SOR Answer.
Applicant stated that he got into financial difficulty “around a year after my first  --
or my  divorce” .  .  .  [s]o  around  2016.” (Tr.  20-21) He found it financially challenging to
maintain two residences after he moved out of the residence he shared with his first wife.
He opened up “a couple of cards -- credit cards . . . and I wasn’t making enough money
to balance all those, and it just started getting in the hole from there and it just got deeper
and deeper.” (Tr. 21-22)
During Applicant’s July 9, 2020 OPM PSI, he stated that he was willing and able
to pay all his bills and debts. He committed to look into any unknown accounts and pay
any  applicable  balance  within  two  years.  The  OPM  investigator  gave  Applicant  the
opportunity  to  provide  documentation  regarding  his  financial  delinquencies.  The
investigator noted that Applicant failed to provide documentation during his interview or
subsequent to his interview to corroborate his disagreement  with accounts in his credit
report. (GE 2) Later, Applicant stated that he has “taken care of everything that I promised
I  would.  The  other  debts  that  are  listed,  I  admitted  to  them  and  then  I  have  not  done
anything towards those because they are so – they are past the statute of limitations, and
I’ve taken care of the ones that were on my credit as collections – that were outstanding.”
(Tr. 22-23)

SOR ¶  1.k  alleged a  $105  charged-off credit union “cash advance” account.

3,  2021,  stating  that  this  account  was  paid  in  full.  (Tr.  36-37;  SOR  Answer)  DEBT
RESOLVED.
Applicant stated that he had no intention of addressing any of  the unpaid debts
because, “I was advised (by a family friend) that they are past the statute of limitations.
So if I were to reopen all of these, they would go back onto my credit and put in collection
accounts, which I heard is more.” (Tr. 37) Department Counsel advised Applicant that in
the  security  clearance  process,  the  Government  was  not  just  concerned  about  legal
technicalities of collectability or not, but rather whether an applicant addresses things for
which  they  are  responsible.  (Tr.  38)  I  reiterated  what  Department  Counsel  advised
Applicant adding that waiting until his debts fell off his credit report was not a responsible
way to address his financial situation. (Tr. 58-59, 66-69) I inquired whether he wanted to
leave  things  as they were  or take additional corrective  action. He  replied,  “No,  if  it will
definitely help me, I will definitely take care of stuff.” (Tr. 58)
When asked whether he had the means to address his delinquent debts, Applicant
responded,  “if  it  will  better  my  chances  for  my  future,  then,  yes,  I  will  definitely  take
actions.” (Tr. 38-39)  Applicant added, that ever since his OPM PSI,  “I have taken care of
the  ones (debts) that I saw  were in outstanding collections since the  interview and  all my
current revolving  debt that I have  is on  time  and  paid  in full  every  time.” (Tr. 39) Applicant
has  not  received   any   financial  counseling.  He  discussed   financial  counseling   with   his
family  and  friends, but they  told him  it would “cost a  lot  of  money  just  to  get some  financial
counseling.” (Tr. 39, 44-45) He stated  that he  has  made  changes in his spending  habits
to  include  spending  “what I know  I can  spend.” He has also placed  small  lines of  credit
on the credit cards that he  does have. (Tr. 39-40)
Applicant’s monthly take home pay is “[a]round $3,200.” His monthly rent is $1,250,
his monthly car payments are $750 for a 2019 Chevrolet Suburban, his monthly internet
service  is  $80,  his  monthly  child  support  garnishment  is  $137,  and  he  estimates  his
monthly utilities are approximately $150. He estimated his annual salary to be $58,000.
Applicant’s  wife  buys  groceries  which  average  $300  to  $400  a  month  with  her  child
support  that  she  receives  from the father of her child.  Applicant  estimates  his monthly
credit card bills are approximately $100. He usually spends his entire take home pay to
cover  his  bills.  Any  money  that  he  has  left  after  paying  his  bills  goes  into  his  savings
account.  Applicant  has  approximately $3,500  in  his  savings  account.  He  has  a  401(k)
retirement  account  through  his  employer,  but  he  does  not  know  the  balance  of  his
account. (Tr. 40-44, 61)
Personal Conduct
The SOR lists two allegations under this concern. SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b allege two
terminations  from  two  separate  employers  in  2017  and  2018,  which  are  discussed  in
further detail below. These allegations are established by his March 4, 2020 SF-86, GE
1 and 2, his September 3, 2021 SOR Answer, and his hearing testimony. Applicant initially
self-reported both of these allegations on his March 4, 2020 SF-86. The only evidence
developed regarding these two allegations was derived from Applicant’s March 4, 2020
SF-86, his July 9, 2020 OPM PSI, and his hearing testimony.  There is no Government
evidence  to  refute  or  corroborate  Applicant’s  version  of  the  facts  regarding  these  two
terminations.
SOR  ¶  2.a  alleges  that  Applicant  was  terminated  in  April  2018  from  his
position  as  a  maintenance  technician  at  an  apartment  complex  for  violating  the
terms of his employment by participating in an on-site, after-hours party. Applicant
had a job at this apartment complex as a resident maintenance technician for which he
received an hourly wage and lived at the complex at a reduced cost. (Tr. 49-50)
While employed at this apartment complex, Applicant had befriended “a couple of
my  neighbors,  and  they  weren’t  the  best  neighbors  to  everyone  else.”  (Tr.  50)  These
neighbors had an after-hours party that became loud and boisterous. Applicant had been
invited to attend this party, but declined because he had to take his wife to the hospital
for  induced  labor.  Applicant  was  later  accused  by  one  of  the  apartment  residents  of
attending that party. Applicant informed his supervisor that he was at the hospital with his
wife at the time of this boisterous party. The complaining neighbor showed the apartment
complex  management  pictures  of  Applicant  that  she  had  purportedly  taken  of  him
attending   this  party.  However,  Applicant  pointed   out   that  the   pictures  were  of  him
attending   a   daytime   children’s  birthday   party   at  the   neighbors  versus  attending   the
boisterous party in question. (Tr. 50-51, 55-58)
The terms of Applicant’s employment did not prohibit him from socializing with his
neighbors,  but  preclude  his  off-duty  behavior  from  participating  in  or  causing  a
disturbance. Applicant protested his termination with a “maintenance supervisor,” but was
informed  by  the  supervisor,  “My  hands  are  pretty  much  tied.”  (Tr.  51)  Applicant  was
unable to offer an explanation as to why this complaining neighbor tried to implicate him
stating, “To  be  honest,  I’m  not sure, but  one  –  but from the angles of  the pictures that
they’re coming from, it was – this lady – and I was really nice always to her and she would
always ask for me to come into her apartment, so I’m not sure what I did to her. . ..” (Tr.
52,  55-58)  Applicant  had  never  been  counseled  or  received  formal  write-ups  while
employed at this apartment complex. (Tr. 52) Applicant cannot understand why he had
these issues because as he explained, “I’m a very type of people person, too, but I guess
that’s how my family is.” (Tr. 53)
Applicant  was  given  the  choice  of  being  terminated  or  leaving  by  mutual
agreement.  Applicant  chose  to  leave  by  mutual  agreement  because  he  already  had  a
better paying job at a plumbing company and by leaving voluntarily his supervisor offered
to  act  as  a  reference  for  him.  Note  –  Applicant’s  testimony  regarding  this  incident  is
consistent with what he told the investigator during his July 9, 2020 OPM PSI. (GE 2)
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges that Applicant was terminated in February 2017 from his
position  as  a  maintenance  technician  at  an  apartment  complex  for  stealing  a
refrigerator. Applicant had a job at this apartment complex as a resident maintenance
technician for which he received an hourly wage and lived at the complex rent-free. He
had worked there for “about two years.” Management was remodeling the complex with
all new appliances, flooring, and lighting. The appliances removed from the apartments
were  placed by  the  dumpster to  be  hauled  away  by  the  “local junk  guy.” Also,  various
people would “come and just pick ‘em up and take ‘em home or whatever they did with
‘em – sell ‘em.” (Tr. 45-47, 53-55)
Applicant’s father saw the old refrigerators sitting by the dumpster and asked him
if it would be possible for him to secure one of the old refrigerators for him to use in his
garage. Applicant assured his father that he could do that and one Friday after work he
loaded  an  old  refrigerator  onto  his  truck  and  drove  it  to  his father’s  house.  Applicant’s
manager called him into the office the following week and informed him that one of the
tenants had taken a picture of Applicant driving off the property with the refrigerator on
his truck. Applicant acknowledged that was indeed correct and that he had removed an
old  refrigerator  by  the  dumpster  and  taken  it  to  his  father’s  garage.  At  that  point,
Applicant’s manager terminated him for removing stolen property from his worksite and
gave him 30 days to vacate his apartment. (Tr. 46-47, 53-55)
Applicant stated that it was common practice to remove parts from old appliances
placed  by  the  dumpster  for  future  use.  Applicant  contested  his  termination  with  his
manager  to  no  avail.  Applicant  gleaned  from  the  manager  that  it  “looked  bad”  for  an
employee  who  lived  there to  be  removing  a  refrigerator from  the  property. No police  report
was  filed.  Applicant  had   never  been   accused   of   stealing   before.   After  that,  Applicant
“didn’t argue  or fight ‘em  on  it” and  moved  out within 30  days. (Tr. 48-49, 53-55)  Note –
Applicant’s  testimony   regarding   this  incident  is   consistent   with   what  he   told   the
investigator during his July 9, 2020 OPM  PSI. (GE 2)
Character Evidence
Post-hearing,  Applicant  submitted  two  work-related  reference  letters  from  his
production  control  managers.  Both  managers  highly endorse  Applicant.  They  describe
him  as  highly  motivated,  trustworthy,  dependable,  competent,  and  hard-working.  They
view  him  as  an  upwardly  mobile  employee  capable  of  greater  responsibility.  Both
managers recommend Applicant for a security clearance. (AE A, AE B)
