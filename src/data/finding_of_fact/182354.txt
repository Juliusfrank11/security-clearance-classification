employer since  December 2019. (Tr. 31-32) In  2015, he  married, and  he  has a  two-year-

Financial Considerations
Applicant was unemployed from 2013 to 2015 while attending college. (GE 1; SOR
response) From 2016-2018, Applicant and his spouse accrued credit card debt when they
were both employed. (Tr. 53) They used credit cards to support themselves and spent
more  than  they  should  have  on  eating  at  restaurants  and  other  activities.  (Tr.  42)  His
vehicle’s transmission failed, and he needed to purchase a new vehicle. (Tr. 43) He had
expensive dental bills. (Tr. 69) His spouse has not been employed outside their home for
about three years. (Tr. 40) He acknowledged that he failed to budget and limit expenses
resulting in increased debt. (Tr. 50-51, 54)
Applicant disclosed 11 delinquent debts on his November 18, 2019 SCA, and he
indicated  he  started  resolving  his  delinquent  debts  using  a  debt  resolution  company
(DRC) in April 2019. (GE 1) Applicant’s SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts totaling $39,266,
of  the  following  amounts:  $10,211;  $5,223;  $4,861;  $4,353;  $3,465;  $2,819;  $2,631;
$2,307; $1,354; $987; $579; and $476. The first 11 debts are charged-off credit cards or
loans  from  lending  institutions,  and  the  last  debt  is  a  collections  account  owed  to  a
telecommunications company.
Applicant  entered   into   a   contract   with   DRC  in  January   2019.   (Tr.   57;  SOR
response; AE  A) Before  January  2019, Applicant was making  the  minimum  payments on
his credit  cards, and  DRC  advised  him  to  stop  making  payments. (Tr.  45, 55-56) In  March
2019,  Applicant  began   paying   DRC  $500   monthly.  DRC  contacted   the   creditors   and
established  or attempted  to  establish  payment plans with  the  creditors. (Tr. 45; AE  A;  AE
R)  At  the   time   of   the   hearing,  Applicant  was  paying   $580   monthly   to   DRC.  (Tr.  45)
Applicant  paid   off   his   spouse’s  vehicle   in   April  2022,  and   he   intends  to   increase   his
monthly   payment  to   DRC  to   complete   the   payment  plan   sooner   than   the   scheduled
completion  date  in about  two  years. (Tr. 45,  47-48)  He received  credit counseling  from
DRC. (Tr. 44, 59-60)  His budget  indicates he  has net annual income  of about  $57,000.
(Tr.  60-61;  AE   R)   He  is  making   the   following   monthly   payments:   purchasing   company
stock  for  $350;  putting   $350   into   a   401k   account;  and   saving   $140.  (AE   R)   The   401k
contribution of $350 includes a  portion  from  his employer, and the stock purchase is at a
discounted  price.  (Tr.  58) Applicant and  his family  live  with  his spouse’s grandmother  in
her house. (Tr. 48) He  pays $500  monthly  for rent.  (Tr. 48) He intends to  purchase  the
house once their other debts are paid. (Tr. 48)
DRC paid the  settlement amounts for three  SOR debts, and  they  are  resolved: ¶
1.b   (balance   at   settlement:   $5,605;   settled   for  $2,803);   ¶   1.h   (balance   at   settlement:

The creditor for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e ($3,465) and 1.i ($1,354) refused to work

creditor’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit. (Tr. 47; AE B-AE F)
Applicant’s student loans total about $74,000. (Tr. 63, 68) Before the COVID-19
pandemic-related deferment, his student loans were in “pays as agreed status.” (GE 2)

when  the  deferment  ends.  (Tr.  63-64)  He  timely files  his  state  and  federal  income  tax
returns. (Tr. 67) He does not owe any delinquent taxes. (Tr. 67)

He loves his employment, and he expects to have continued success at work. (Tr. 49, 70)
He received a pay raise in the last 12 months, and he increased his monthly payment to
DRC to $580. (Tr. 63)
