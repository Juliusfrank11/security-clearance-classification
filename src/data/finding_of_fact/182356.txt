In his answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are
incorporated  into  my  findings  of  fact.  Based  on  my  review  of  the  pleadings,  evidence
submitted, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is 38 years old. He has a daughter who is a minor. He was married in
2008,  and  divorced  in  2011.  He  married  his  second  wife  in  2011,  and  they  are  in  the
process  of  getting  a  divorce.  Since  2017,  he  has  worked  as  a  field  technician  for  a
government contractor. He reported on his SCA that he has been steadily employed since
2005, except for one period of unemployment from March to September 2012. (TR. 10,
38; GE 1, 2).
Applicant stated that he is the only income earner in his family, and that his wife
has not consistently worked since they were married. She was not working at the start of
their marriage,  and  since  has  only held  jobs  on  a  short-term  basis.  He  claims  that  his
wife’s  inconsistent  employment  history  is  the  reason  for  his  financial  problems.  He
asserted that his debts can be easily managed and solved once his divorce is finalized.
He reported that his wife has experienced health problems since they were married, which
has resulted in hospital visits and medical bills for her care. (Tr. 18-20, 22-23)
The SOR alleges a 2014 Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and nine delinquent debts totaling
about $45,460. The status of the allegations is as follows:
SOR  ¶  1.a  is  a  2014  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  that  had  approximately  $63,869  in
outstanding liabilities. Applicant stated that this bankruptcy was due to poor management
of his finances, and that he had no other solution to resolve his debts at that time. (Tr. 20,
35; GE 1, 2, 3)
SOR ¶ 1.b is a utility account that has been placed for collection for $210. Applicant
claimed that he reached out to the collection agency in 2021, and they had no record of
the debt. He asserted that he does not know who is the current credit holder of the debt.
He reported that this debt has not been resolved. He did not provide sufficient evidence
documenting his communications with the collection agency. (Tr. 24-25; GE 2, 4, 5, 6)
SOR ¶ 1.c is an account for car insurance that has been placed for collection for
$497. In his background interview with a government investigator, Applicant stated that
this debt is from a canceled car insurance policy. He told the investigator that he would
resolve this debt in 2020. At the hearing, he testified that he has not reached out to the
creditor or resolved the debt. (Tr. 25; GE 2, 4, 5, 6)
SOR  ¶  1.d  is  a  charged-off  auto  loan  for  a  repossessed  car  in  the  amount  of
$14,327.  In his background  interview,  Applicant  stated  that he  could  not afford  his  car
payments because his wife was ill and unemployed, but that he would resolve the debt
within the next year. At the hearing, he testified that his last contact with the creditor was
in January 2020, and the debt remains unpaid. (Tr. 25-26; GE 2, 4, 5, 6)
SOR  ¶¶  1.e  and  1.f  are  charged-off  personal  loans  for  $2,770  and  $2,043,
respectively. In his background interview, Applicant claimed that he took these loans to
cover medical expenses for his wife, and he committed to make installment payments to
satisfy the loans. At the hearing, he testified that he has not made payments on the loans,
and  he  did  not  provide  documentation  of  any  efforts he  took  to  contact  the  creditor or
resolve these debts. (Tr. 23-24; GE 2, 4, 5, 6)
SOR  ¶  1.g  is  delinquent  car  loan  in  the  amount  of  $17,879.  In  his  background
interview, Applicant stated that the car was totaled in an accident, and his gap insurance
should  have  covered  this  debt.  At  his  hearing,  he  claimed  that  he  contacted  the  gap
insurance company in 2020, and he needs to dispute the debt with the credit reporting
agency. He did not provide sufficient documentation of his gap insurance claim, his credit
report dispute, or any payments made on this debt. (Tr. 28-30, 36; GE 2, 4, 5, 6)
SOR  ¶  1.h  is  a  debt  in  collection  for  cellular  phones  in  the  amount  of  $3,911.
Applicant  stated  that  he  and  his  family  received  the  phones  from  a  cellular  service
provider. When he broke their contract to switch to another service provider, he did not
repay the amount that they owed for the phones. This debt has not been resolved. (Tr.
30, 34; GE 2, 5)
SOR ¶ 1.i is a medical debt in collection for $3,199. Applicant claimed that his debt
was for emergency medical care for his wife. He did not explain why her medical debt
would appear on his credit report and not hers. He stated that he has not taken any action
to resolve this debt. (Tr. 30, 34; GE 2, 5)
SOR  ¶  1.j  is a  medical  debt  in  collection  for  $624.  In  his  background  interview,
Applicant  stated  that  this  debt  was  for  an  emergency  room  visit  after  he  was  in  a  car
accident, and claimed that he would resolve this debt in 2020. At the hearing, he testified
that he has not taken any action to resolve this debt. (Tr. 30, 34; GE 2, 5)
Applicant provided a budget as part of his post-hearing submission. It shows that
he has about $3,800 of monthly income, and about $2830 in monthly expenses. Applicant
did  not  provide  any  information  about  what  happens  to  his  approximate  monthly
remainder of $970. At the hearing, he testified that he was not in a position to address his
debts, and that he had no savings, and only $200 in his checking account. (Tr. 30-33; AE
