Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  used marijuana with  varying frequency from about
December 2018 to about November 2019.
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying frequency from about
December 2018 to about November 2019, while granted access to classified information.
In   June   2008,  the   DOD  granted,  and   in  February   2014,  the   DOD  renewed
Applicant’s   security   clearance.  (Tr.   21-22)   From   December   2018   to   about  November
2019, he  used  marijuana. He  worked  for the  same  DOD contractor  during  this time  period.
(Tr.  19;  GE   1)  He  did   not  have   access   to   classified   information   when   he   was  using
marijuana. (Tr. 31) He  did not use  marijuana  on  business trips or in the  workplace. (Tr.
34)  He   needed   a   security   clearance   to   have   access  to   his  employer’s  facility   or  DOD
facilities  on   behalf   of  his  employer;  however,  he   did  not   have   access   to   classified
information. (Tr. 32-33)
Applicant’s  November  12,  2019  SCA  asked  about  use  of  illegal  drugs  in  the
previous  seven  years.  (Tr.  22;  GE  1)  Applicant  voluntarily  responded  that  he  used
marijuana  from  December  2018  to  November  2019.  (Tr.  23;  GE  1)  He  explained,
“Seldom, recreational use outside of  work, primarily on  weekends.” (GE 1  at 35) As for
plans of future marijuana use, he said “I do not intend to keep using now that I am actively
on a government contract again and it really doesn’t do much for me.” (Id.) In his February
25, 2020 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview, he said he used marijuana
about 20 times during this period. (GE 4 at 2) He used marijuana because he was curious
about  how  it  would  affect  him.  (Id.)  He  does  not  intend  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future
because of his employment. (Id.)
At his hearing, Applicant said he probably used marijuana less than 20 times. (Tr.
23) He is no  longer friends with  the  persons who  provided  the  marijuana  to  him, and  he
stopped  associating  with  them  about one  year ago. (Tr. 24, 27-29) If  marijuana  is offered
to Applicant, he refuses to  use it. (Tr. 29)
Applicant’s spouse had a marijuana prescription for pain, and her prescription has
probably expired. (Tr. 40) She sometimes used marijuana with Applicant; however, she
stopped using marijuana in January 2022. (Tr. 24-25, 30, 41) He is not specifically aware
of the presence of marijuana or drug paraphernalia in his house. (Tr. 30-31) He did not
ask her whether she had any remaining marijuana in their house. (Tr. 41)
Applicant  never  used  marijuana  before  or  after  the  period  December  2018  to
November 2019. (Tr. 27) Marijuana is the only illegal drug he ever used. (Tr. 26-27) He
did not test positive on a urinalysis test for use of any illegal substances. He has 15 years
of DOD-related employment and held a security clearance for 15 years.
Applicant  was  aware  that  marijuana  use  is  illegal  under  federal  law.  (Tr.  22)
Recreational use of  marijuana  is illegal in  his state  of  residence.  (Tr. 23)  He  knew his
employer  opposed  marijuana  use  by  employees,  and  federal  contractors  were  not
supposed to use marijuana. (Tr. 33-34) His employer did not conduct testing for illegal
substances.  (Tr.  35)  He  was  aware  that  marijuana  use  might  jeopardize  his  security
clearance. (Tr. 36, 39)
