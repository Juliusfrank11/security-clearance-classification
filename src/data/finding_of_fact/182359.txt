In  Applicant’s SOR response, he  admitted  the  SOR allegations  in ¶¶  1.a  through
1.d.   (HE   3)  He  also  provided   mitigating   information.  His   admissions   are   accepted   as
findings  of  fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant  is  a  74-year-old  electronics  engineer,  who  has  worked  for  the  same
defense contractor since 1985. (Tr. 42) He has 37 years of experience as an electronics
engineer. (Tr. 21-22; GE 1) He honorably served on active duty in the Army from 1969 to
1971,  and  in  the  Army  Reserve  from  1971  to  1975.  (Tr.  21-22)  He  did  not  serve  in  a
combat  zone.  (Tr. 86) When  he  left  the  Army he  was  a  Specialist 5  (E-5). (Tr. 22)  He
received a bachelor’s degree in 1972. (Tr. 39) He married the first time in 1969, and he
divorced in 1984. (Tr. 39; GE 1) He married the second time in 1986, and he divorced in
2003.  (Tr.  40;  GE  1)  He  does  not  have  any  children.  (Tr.  40)  He  has  held  a  security
clearance for 37 years as a contractor and during his time in the Army. (Tr. 22-23) There
is  no  evidence  of  security  violations.  His  resume  provides  additional  details  about  his
professional background.  (AE G)  He  needs his  security clearance to  retain  his current
employment. (Tr. 71)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s  annual  base  pay  is  about  $200,000,  and  he  sometimes  receives  a
bonus of about $12,000. (Tr. 36, 42) He also receives about $45,000 annually from the
Social Security Administration (SSA). (Tr. 43) He started receiving SSA payments when
he reached age 70. (Tr. 44)
Applicant  had  a  girlfriend,  and  her  daughter  was  born  in  1998.  (Tr.  35,  40)  His
girlfriend was addicted to the use of illegal drugs. (Tr. 23, 47) Applicant provided money
to his girlfriend for living expenses, and she said she had to pay her drug dealer, who was
threatening her life. (Tr. 24, 50, 53) She showed him a broken window and a bullet hole
to convince him the threats were real. (Tr. 54) He did not indicate that he called the police
or that he ensured his payments were not used to procure illegal drugs. In 2014 and 2015,
he took extra funds out of his 401(k) account to assist his girlfriend. (Tr. 45-46; GE 5) He
was unsure about how much he provided to her. (Tr. 52) He did not intend for her to use
the money he gave her to purchase illegal drugs. (Tr. 53) He reduced his 401(k) account
from about $300,000 to about $50,000. (Tr. 46) He temporarily stopped paying his debts
and filing his federal income tax returns. (Tr. 35) He conceded, “when you’re in love, you
do stupid things, I guess.” (Tr. 54) Applicant’s girlfriend died of a heart attack shortly after
leaving a drug-treatment program. (Tr. 40) He continues to provide financial support to
his girlfriend’s daughter, who is now 23 years old. (Tr. 40-41)
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($5,313), 1.d ($13,983), 1.e ($2,714), and 1.f ($8,494)
became delinquent in 2015 and 2016. (Tr. 66) In December 2019, Applicant paid a debt-
settlement company (DSC) a $1,500 retainer because he had difficulty determining which
creditor  held  these  four  debts.  (Tr.  35,  67;  AE  B)  He  asked  DSC  to  attempt  to  reach
settlement  agreements  for  these four  debts on  his behalf.  (Tr. 27)  In  December 2019,
DSC sent letters to the four creditors indicating he had a significantly reduced income; he
was  considering  filing  for  bankruptcy;  and  payment  was  “infeasible.”  (Tr.  69;  AE  C)
Applicant did not review the letters DSC sent to his creditors before they were sent. (Tr.
76,  77-79)  Applicant  suggested  the  language  of  the  letters  to  the  creditors  was  DSC
attempting to negotiate a favorable settlement. (Tr. 69)  DSC offered to settle the debts
for  about  10  percent  of  the  amount  owed.  (Tr.  67;  AE  C)  In  December  2019,  he  was
concerned  about  losing  his  employment.  (Tr.  68)  The  creditors  did  not  reply to  DSC’s
settlement offers. (Tr. 28, 30-32) DSC said the debt might be collection barred due to the
statute  of  limitations.  (Tr.  30,  32)  DSC  changed  the  lawyer  who  was  supposed  to
represent Applicant several times. (Tr. 75) Applicant contacted DSC the week before his
hearing to check the status of the negotiations with his creditors, and DSC advised him
that  there  were  no  responses.  (Tr. 71. 76) DSC recommended  that he  not  contact his
creditors because if he “appeared too eager, they would not negotiate very well.” (Tr. 71)
Applicant did not intend to directly contact the SOR creditors. (Tr. 77) If DSC was
unable to make progress resolving his debts, he may consider hiring a different lawyer to
assist him. (Tr. 77)
On  April  24,  2020,  Applicant  told  an  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)
investigator that he hoped to get a payment plan in place for each of his creditors, and he
had sufficient income and an inheritance which would enable him to pay his debts. (Tr.
71; GE 5 at 10) At his hearing, he said he is willing to pay his debts, and he wanted to
establish  payment  plans  with  his  creditors.  (Tr.  35)  However,  he  did  not  want  to
excessively reduce his reserves.  (Tr. 35) He intends to pay his debts.  (Tr. 38)  He has
about $125,000 available from an inheritance available to pay his debts. (Tr. 60)
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  failed  to  file  his  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax
years (TY) 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. His adjusted gross income (AGI) for the following
TYs  were  as  follows  (rounded  to  nearest  $1,000):  TY  2014  ($280,000);  TY  2015
($293,000); TY  2016  ($196,000); and  2017  ($177,000). (Tr. 45; AE  A1) He was out of
town   when   his  filing   extension   expired   for  TY   2014.   (Tr.  56)  Around   2019,  Applicant
received  a  letter from  the  IRS  advising  him  that his tax  returns were not filed. (Tr. 24; SOR
response) Applicant  hired  an  accountant  who  filed  his  tax  returns form  2014,  2015,  2016,
and  2017  in  April 2019. (Tr.  25, 57;  AE  A1) He  failed  to  timely  file  his federal income  tax
returns for those  four  TYs because  of fear, uncertainty, procrastination,  and  laziness. (Tr.
56) He  was concerned  about  the  complication  of computing  IRS  penalties and about the
amount of  additional taxes he  might owe. (Tr. 56) Applicant used  some  of  the  $200,000
he  inherited  from  his  mother to  pay  his  $75,000  federal  income  tax  debt  in July  of  2019.
(Tr. 25, 58-59; AE A1)  He timely  filed his federal income tax  returns for TYs 2018, 2019,
and  2020,  and  he  filed  his TY  2021  federal income  tax  return in June  2022. (Tr. 61) He
does not owe any taxes to the IRS. (Tr. 62) His state  does not have a state income tax.

On August 2, 2022, DSC offered to pay the creditor $221.40 monthly for 24 months to
resolve the balance owed of $5,314. (AE O) The first payment was due on August 15,
2021. (Id.) He provided a photocopy of the front of the first check to the creditor. (AE P)
SOR ¶  1.c  alleges  a  charged-off  bank  debt  for $33,956.  He  did  not pay  the  creditor
because  “[i]t  seemed  pointless” because  of  the  problems he  was having  with  his girlfriend.
(Tr. 65) In   2017, the  bank  sued   Applicant,   and   in  2019,  Applicant agreed   to   pay   $566
monthly  for 58  months  for a  total of  $33,956. (Tr. 29, 64; AE  D; AE  L)  Applicant is making
the  required  payments, and  the balance owed  is down  to  $12,400. (Tr. 29, 65;  AE  K)  He
intends to  continue  his  payments  until the  debt is  paid. (Tr.  66)  The  debt  is scheduled  to
be paid in April 2024. (AE L)
SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.e  allege  two  charged-off  credit-card  debts  for  $13,983  and
$2,714  owed  to  the  same  creditor.  Applicant  did  not  make  any  payments  before  his
hearing. (Tr. 30) On August 2, 2022, DSC advised the creditor that Applicant wanted to
pay both accounts in full over the course of 24 months, and  the creditor accepted  this
arrangement. Applicant agreed to make the first $583 payment on August 15, 2022, and
make monthly payments until $13,983 is paid. (AE M) Similarly, he agreed to make 24

to pay the accounts in full over the course of 24 months, and the creditor accepted this

make monthly payments until $8,494 is paid. (AE Q) He provided a photocopy of the front

emphasized  his  professionalism  and  contributions  to  his  company.  (AE  F)  Their
statements support his continued access to classified information. He received excellent
performance evaluations from his employer. (Tr. 34; AE E; AE J)
