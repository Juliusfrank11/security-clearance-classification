In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  partially  admitted  and  partially  denied  the
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.f. (HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. (Id.)
His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 64-year-old telecommunications technician who has worked for DOD
contractors at the same location since 1985. (Tr. 6, 8-9, 24-25; GE 1 at 10-12) He is a
high  school  graduate,  and  in  2005,  he  received  an  associate’s  degree  in  electronics
technology. (Tr. 6-7; GE 1 at 9) He was married from 1985 to 2005, and his sons are ages
29 and 31. (Tr. 7-8) He was deployed to Germany while he was on active duty in the Air
Force. (Tr. 27) He received an Outstanding Unit Award and an Air Force Commendation
Medal. (Tr. 27-28) He honorably served in the Air Force from 1978 to 1984. (Tr. 8)  He
has held a security clearance for about 40 years. (Tr. 26) There is no evidence of security
violations, arrests, convictions, use of illegal drugs, or abuse of alcohol. (GE 1)
Financial Considerations
In the last 10 years, Applicant’s income has varied from $60,000 to $80,000. (Tr.
25)  His base  salary  is  $44  an  hour, and  he  frequently  receives overtime  pay.  His total
monthly   expenses   are   about   $1,750.   (Tr.  32)  He   has   a   monthly   remainder  of  about
$2,000. (Tr. 32) His adjusted  gross income  (AGI) on  his IRS  Form  1040  for three  recent
tax   years  (TY)  was  as  follows  (rounded   to   nearest   $1,000):  2019   ($79,000);  2020
($76,000);  and  2021  ($78,000). (AE  G-AE  I) Each  TY  he  owed  $500  to  $1,000.  (Id.)  Thus,
no federal income  tax  refund  was available for transfer to  address unpaid  federal student
loans  for those three  TYs. He does not owe any tax debts.
Applicant has about $24,000 in his checking account, a certificate of deposit valued
at $104,000, and about $885,000 in a retirement account. (Tr. 29-30) After his divorce,
he was supposed to receive about $700 monthly from his former spouse because he had
custody of his two sons. (Tr. 31) The confluence of events relating to his divorce, decline
in the housing market, and his sons needing financial support while in college caused his
financial problems. (Tr. 55) He elected to financially support his sons instead of paying
his mortgage. (Tr. 55) His two sons currently have excellent jobs. (Tr. 56)
The January 28, 2021 SOR alleges seven delinquent debts as follows:
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  a  $500  delinquent  medical  debt,  which  resulted  when
Applicant’s  son  was  injured  and  taken  to  the  hospital  in  an  ambulance.  (Tr.  33)  He
believed his son requested that his health insurance cover the bill. (Tr. 34) His son moved
five times, and his son evidently did not receive the bills. (Tr. 35) Several months before
his hearing he contacted his son, and his son said he would take care of the bill. (Tr. 36)
On July 19, 2022, Applicant paid this debt, and he provided a confirmation number. (AE
J)
SOR  ¶¶  1.b  through  1.e  allege  four  student-loan  debts  totaling  about  $48,600
placed for collection for $8,360, $18,215, $13,666, and $8,352. Applicant borrowed the
funds to enable his son to attend college. (Tr. 36-37) His son graduated from college in
2019, and then his student loans were deferred for six months. (Tr. 37) Applicant received
delinquency notices and contacted his son. He erroneously believed his son was paying
on the loans because his son repeatedly assured him he was paying the student loans;
however, his son was apparently making payments on different student loans. (Tr. 38,
40-41)
After  receiving  two  or  three  notices,  around  March  2020,  Applicant’s  pay  was
garnished  for  $700  a  month.  (Tr.  39-41)  After  his  pay  was  garnished,  he  called  the
Department of Education (D. Ed.) and asked them to transfer the loans under his son’s
name; however, D. Ed. refused. (Tr. 39-40, 42) Applicant’s son agreed to pay Applicant,
and then Applicant was going to pay D. Ed. (Tr. 39) Garnishments occurred in March and
April 2020. (Tr. 41)
In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the D. Ed. placed federal
student loans in forbearance, and Applicant’s scheduled garnishment for May 2020 did
not  occur.  (Tr.  39,  41)  The  D.  Ed.  extended  the  student-loan  payment  pause  through
August 31, 2022. The pause includes the following relief measures for eligible loans: a
suspension of loan payments; a 0% interest rate; and stopped collections on defaulted
loans.  See  Federal  Student  Aid  website,  https://studentaid.gov/announcements-
events/covid-19. Applicant said “I certainly have the assets to pay this off and I have no
trouble  doing  so.  I’m  just  waiting  for  the  Government’s  next  move.”  (Tr.  39,  44)  He
expected the garnishments to resume soon, and he emphasized “I certainly can pay the
balance off at any time.” (Tr. 43)
Applicant’s  June  9,  2022  credit  report  indicates  the  following  for his four  D.  Ed.
student-loan  debts:  high  credit  of  $6,000  and  current  balance  $8,360;  high  credit  of
$12,000  and  current  balance  of  $18,215;  high  credit  of  $9,000  and  current  balance  of
$13,666; and high credit of $6,000 and current balance of $8,352. (GE 2 at 3-4) The debts
were all at least six-months delinquent before the federal forbearance. (Id.)
SOR ¶¶  1.f  and  1.g  allege  a  delinquent mortgage  and a home  equity  account owed
to  the  same mortgage company  which may  have  been  resolved  through  a foreclosure in
2015. In  2003, Applicant purchased  a  home  in 2003  with  a  $140,000  mortgage, which
was  subsequently   refinanced   for  $165,000.  (Tr.  45-46)  In   2008,  he   borrowed   $95,000
through  a  home  equity  loan.  (Tr.  46)  In  2015,  he  was not  receiving  all  of the  $700  monthly
payments  from his former spouse  for child  support, and  his two  sons were in college  and
had  significant expenses. (Tr. 47-48) He could  not afford the  payments on  his mortgage
and  home  equity  loan. (Tr. 47) He said “the  financial demands of  my  two  kids [were] more
important  [than]  saving   the   family   home.”  (Tr.  50)  He  discussed   refinancing   with   his
mortgage  company, and  they  may  have  suggested  that  he  stop  making  payments.  (Tr.
48) He  kept  providing  documentation  for the  refinancing  of  his residence;  however, the
mortgage  company  was never satisfied  with  the  documentation  he  submitted. (Tr. 48-49)
He  did   not  make   any   payments   for  6   to   12   months   and   the   creditor foreclosed   on   the
property in 2015.  (Tr. 49)
Applicant learned that the federal government had sued  his mortgage lender for
unfair lending practices. (Tr. 51; AE D) He contacted the federal government; however,
he was not provided documentation showing he was added as a plaintiff to the lawsuit.
(Tr. 51) He did not attempt to sell his house as a short sale. (Tr. 53) He was unaware of
the amount  the house was  sold for at  the foreclosure.  (Tr. 53) He was  not  specifically
advised whether there was a deficiency as a result of the foreclosure. (Tr. 52-53)
Applicant’s  May  2,  2022  credit  report  indicates  a  high  credit  $140,000  joint
mortgage  account,  “pays  account  as  agreed”  status,  actual  payment  $68,847,  and  a
current  balance  of  zero.  (GE  2  at  9)  His  November  25,  2017  credit  report  indicates  a
$95,000 debt owed to the same creditor as his mortgage. (GE 6 at 3) The $95,000 debt
is shown with an account closed designation, foreclosure, and a zero current balance.
(Id.)  Court  documents  indicate  the  foreclosure  amount  was  $169,712.  (GE  7  at  5)  In
March  2016,  the  court  disbursed  a  “foreclosure  surplus.”  (GE  8  at  7)  I  requested  that
Applicant find out whether there was a deficiency and the status of the foreclosure after
the hearing. (Tr. 56-57) However, in light of the evidence of record indicating resolution
through forfeiture seven years ago in 2015, I am satisfied that the two debts related to his
residence are resolved.
Character Evidence
Applicant has served his country since 1978. (Tr. 55) He believes he is financially
responsible. (Tr. 55) His father served the United States in World War II and the Korean
War; his grandfather served the United States in World War I; and his brother served the
United States in the Vietnam War. (Tr. 54-55) Other relatives also served in the military.
(Tr. 54-55)
In 1979, Applicant received letters of appreciation from a colonel, master sergeant,
second lieutenant, and civilians. (AE E) He also had excellent performance evaluations.
(AE E) In 1989, 1992, and 2019, he received letters of appreciation or commendation,

contributions to mission accomplishment. (AE F) Applicant loves his job and takes great
pride  in  his  work.  (Tr.  56)  He  wants  to  continue  to  contribute  to  his  employer  and  his
