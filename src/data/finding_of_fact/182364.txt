Financial Considerations
The  SOR alleges 12  delinquent debts totaling  $25,393  with  the  following  balances:
¶ 1.a (past due in the  amount of $7,893 with  a balance of  $13,497);  ¶ 1.b ($5,507); ¶ 1.c
($1,556); ¶ 1.d  ($1,497); ¶ 1.e  ($662);  ¶ 1.f ($627); ¶ 1.g  ($569);  ¶ 1.h  ($351);  ¶ 1.i  ($345);
¶ 1.j ($336); ¶  1.k ($262); and  ¶  1.l ($184). (Item  1) SOR ¶  1.m  alleges Applicant failed  to
file  a  federal income  tax  return for tax  year 2018, and  SOR ¶  1.n  alleges he  owes federal
income taxes of about $2,000  for TY 2018. (Id.)
The  debts in  SOR ¶¶  1.b  through  1.j, and  1.l were placed  for collection. (Items 1,
2) The  debt in  SOR  ¶  1.a  was delinquent,  and  the  debt in  ¶  1.k was charged  off.  (Items
1, 2)
During Applicant’s July 20, 2020 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal
subject  interview,  Applicant  volunteered  that he filed  his and  his spouse’s  joint federal
income tax return for TY 2018. (Item 4 at 5) In 2020, he received a letter from the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) stating he failed to file his or his spouse’s W2 forms showing their
earnings. (Id.) One of Applicant’s employers sent him an incorrect W2, and he wrote his
employer  asking  for  a  correct  W2.  (Id.)  He  never  received  a  corrected  W2  from  his
employer. (Id.) His spouse intends to file her federal income tax return as married filing
separate. (Id.) He estimated that when he filed his federal income tax return for TY 2018,
he and his spouse owed less than $2,000. (Id.) He plans to file his TY 2018 income tax
return after his wife files her married filing separate tax return. (Id.)
When Applicant responded to the SOR on January 22, 2022, he admitted all of the
financial  allegations  without  elaboration,  except  he  disputed  the  amount  of  his  debt  in
SOR  ¶  1.b  ($5,507).  He  did  not  indicate  that  he  made  payments  to  any  of  his  SOR
creditors, had established payment plans, or filed disputes of the SOR debts. He did not
indicate whether he refiled his TY 2018 federal income tax return or paid any additional
federal income taxes owed for that year.
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges Applicant failed to disclose on his June 22, 2020 SCA that he
had delinquent debts. His SCA asked whether in the last seven years he had any debts
in collections, charged-off debts, defaulted on any loan, or been delinquent over 120 days
on any debt. (Item 3 at 39-40) He answered, no, and he did not disclose any delinquent
debts in his SCA. (Item 3 at 39-40)
During  his  July  20,  2020  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  interview,
Applicant said without being confronted that he had: (1) defaulted on debts; (2) debts in
collections;  and  was  more  than  120  days’  delinquent  on  debts.  (Item  4  at  4)  He
remembered  some  delinquent  debts  and  the  OPM  investigator  told  him  about  other
delinquent debts on his credit report.
SOR ¶  2.b  alleges Applicant failed  to  disclose  on  his June  22, 2020  SCA that he
failed  to timely  file  his federal income  tax  return in TY  2018  and  that  he  owed  delinquent
taxes for TY  2018.  His June  22, 2020  SCA asked  whether he  failed  to  timely  file  or pay
federal income  taxes in the  previous seven  years, and  Applicant answered, no. (Item  3  at
39) During  his July  20, 2020  OPM  interview, Applicant  said without  being  confronted  that
he  failed  to  file  his and  his  spouse’s  W2s with  their  joint  federal  income  tax  return for TY
2018,  and  he  owed  less than  $2,000 as discussed  supra.
SOR  ¶  2.c  alleges  Applicant  was  fired  from  his  employment  in  May  2020  for
numerous  infractions  of  company  policies,  violating  client  rights,  and  harassment  or
abuse  of  clients.  (Item  1)  Management  alleged  he  omitted  pertinent  information  when
management questioned him about his offenses. (Id.) He is not eligible for rehire. (Id.)
On May 18, 2020, Applicant’s employer wrote that Applicant was terminated from
his employment because: (1) he left a group of clients unattended; (2) he was sleeping
while responsible for high-risk precaution clients; and (3) he threatened a client. (Item 8
at 1)
In March 2020, Applicant received a reprimand because a staff member heard a
client say to Applicant, “I don’t feel safe after you threatened me the other night.” Applicant
responded  to  the  client,  “shut  the  fxxk  up.”  (GE  8  at  4)  The  staff  member  confronted
Applicant about making the threat, and Applicant admitted he made the threat. (Id.) The
reprimand  does  not  include  the  content  of  the  threat.  In  his  OMP  interview,  Applicant
denied that he engaged in any of the alleged conduct, with the exception that he said he
was  fired  for  leaving  male  and  female  adolescents  unattended  while  he  used  the
restroom. (Item 3 at 3) He denied that there were multiple incidents. (Id.)
SOR ¶ 2.d alleges Applicant was fired from his employment in December 2019 for
sleeping on the job. (Item 1) Applicant told the OPM investigator that he was not sleeping.
He said he was resting his head on his hand because of wisdom-teeth pain, and he was
not asleep. (Item 3 at 3) Applicant said a coworker took his picture and turned him in to
management for sleeping. (Id.)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant was suspended from his employment for two weeks
for bringing his child to his workplace in November 2019, in violation of company policy.
(Item 1) In his SCA, Applicant said he was suspended for two weeks when he reported
for his armed  security guard  employment  and  brought  his child  “due  to  baby  sitter not
picking him up on time.” (Item 3 at 16) During his OPM interview, he said his shift started
at 6 p.m., and his wife could not pick up his son until 10 p.m. (Item 4 at 4) Applicant kept
his son with him at his employment until about 9:30 p.m. when he dropped his son off at
his spouse’s residence. (Id.)
In  the  FORM,  Department  Counsel  described  Applicant’s  security-significant
behavior and noted the absence of mitigation. The FORM informed Applicant that he had
30 days from the receipt of the FORM “in which to submit a documentary response
setting  forth  objections,  rebuttal,  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  explanation,  as
appropriate.  .  .  .  If  [Applicant  does]  not  file  any  objections  or  submit  any  additional
information . . . [his] case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination
based  solely” on  the  evidence  set  forth  in  this  FORM.  (FORM at 5 (emphasis added))
Applicant did not provide any response to the FORM.
