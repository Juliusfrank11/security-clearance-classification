Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.h and denied ¶¶ 2.a
and 2.b. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 52 years old. He served in the military from 1988 to 1992, deployed
during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and was honorably discharged. He
earned an associate degree in 1994. He has three children ages 27, 21, and 17. He was
married from 2003 to 2013. Applicant has owned his own business since 2005. He has
accepted a job with a federal contractor. He will continue to own his business, but it will
be managed by someone else. (Tr. 15-19)
In  2015,  Applicant’s  business  was  burned.  The  losses  from  the  fire  included  a
building, vehicles, tools and records that were used to conduct his business. All of the
assets associated with the business were destroyed by the fire. It was determined the fire
was set by arsonists and was racially motivated with slurs written on the building. The
debts alleged in the SOR were accounts associated with his business. He was the sole
owner of the business and was unable to pay the accounts at the time, but stated he was
responsible for them and intended to pay them. After the fire, he contacted many of his
creditors and used his savings to pay many of his debts, but could not afford to pay all of
them at that time. He paid many debts that were not alleged in the SOR. He paid down
some of the amounts owed in the accounts to show he was making a good-faith effort to
resolve them even if he was unable to make the full payment. He did not want the creditors
to think he had abandoned the debts. He was able to refinance his home in 2022 in order
to pay some of the remaining debts. (Tr. 17-19, 43-44, 56)
The  debts  alleged  are  corroborated  by  Applicant’s  admissions,  statements,  and
credit reports from March 2020, October 2020, and May 2022. (GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Applicant has paid the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($18,446-AE A); 1.c ($4,527-
AE B); 1.d ($887-AE C); 1.e ($386-AE D); 1.f ($92-AE E); and 1.g ($165-AE F). These
debts are resolved. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($39,195-AE H) is enrolled in a payment plan
and Applicant has been making payments of approximately $800 a month since October
2021. SOR ¶ 1.a is being resolved. (Tr. 20-29, 41-42, 44-49)
After the fire, the insurance company refused to pay for the losses, and Applicant
filed a lawsuit. Before the judgment was entered the bank where Applicant obtained his
loan requested the Small Business Administration(SBA) pay the portion of the loan that it
had  backed  when  Applicant received  the  loan.  (SOR 1.h-$71,974) The  SBA  paid  $71,974
to   the   bank.  Later,  a   summary   judgment  was  entered   for  Applicant  and   it  ordered   the
insurer to  pay  the  total amount  of the  loan  to  the  bank, which they  did.  The  bank  was then
required   to   return the  $71,874   to   the   SBA, which  it  did.   Applicant   disputed   the   debt  in
SOR ¶  1.h  with  the  credit bureau  and  it was deleted. This debt  is resolved. (Tr. 29-34,  49-
51; AE G, I)
Applicant  testified  that  he  has  no  new  financial  delinquencies,  his  finances  are
stable and he has participated in credit counseling. (Tr. 46, 53; AE H)
Applicant  credibly  testified  that  when  he  completed  his  security  clearance
application (SCA) in January 2020, he believed he had to only disclose his personal debts.
He did not think he had to disclose his business debts and did not disclose those that are
alleged in the SOR. He testified he did not deliberately fail to disclose or attempt to hide
his debts. He acknowledges he made a mistake. I found his explanation credible. (Tr. 35,
51-53)
Applicant did not disclose in his SCA that he had been charged in about May 2007
with  felony  aggravated  assault,  felony  aggravated  battery,  and  felony  possession  of  a
firearm or knife during the commission of or attempted to commit certain felonies. He was
required  to  disclose  if  he  had  ever been  charged  with  any felony offense,  to  which  he
answered “no.” (Tr. 36-39, 51-53)
Applicant testified that in 2007 he was involved in altercation and was protecting
his family from bodily harm. He was licensed to carry a weapon and he discharged it. He
was arrested and was permitted to participate in a first offender program, which deferred
adjudication. He successfully completed the program. Applicant credibly testified that the
judge told him the status of the charge would be like it never happened. Applicant relied
on what he was told by the judge when he completed his SCA and did not disclose his
felony arrest. (Tr. 35-39) The Order of Discharge from the State ordered:
The defendant be  discharged without adjudication  of guilt;
That this discharge  shall  completely  exonerate  the  defendant of  any  criminal
purpose;
That  this  discharge   shall   not   affect  any   of   said  defendant’s  civil   rights  or
liberties;
The defendant shall not be considered  to  have a criminal conviction; and
This discharge  may  not be  used  to  disqualify  a  person  in any  application  for
employment or appointment to  office in either the  public or private  sector.
(Answer to the  SOR)
Applicant further testified that he did not deliberately or intentionally fail to disclose
his felony arrest, but honestly did not believe he was required to disclose it based on what
he had been previously been told. He acknowledges that he made a mistake. I found his
explanation credible. (Tr. 36-39, 51-53)
Applicant holds a state license to work in his specialized area of construction and
also  has  various  certifications.  He  provided  a  copy  of  his  resume  and  an  award  he
received. He provided a character letter that describes him as intelligent, hard-working,
dedicated, and trustworthy. He is considered a team-player, who is a leader and a person
of integrity. (Tr. 39-40; AE M O, Q, R, S, U)
