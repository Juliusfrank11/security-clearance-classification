(SOR ¶ 1.f: Item 6 at 8, Item 9 at 10, 13)The total amount of the delinquent debt incurred
after the 2016 bankruptcy discharge is approximately $30,267.
Under  Guideline  E,  Personal  Conduct,  it  is  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately
omitted his delinquent debts on an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigation Processing
(e-QIP)  in  response  to  Section  26  - Financial  Record  Delinquency  Involving  Routine
Accounts, which was signed and certified by Applicant on February 5, 2020. (Item 4)
Applicant admits to all of the SOR allegations.
Applicant  filed   bankruptcy   on   October  23,  2015.  He  claimed   total  assets  of
$250,433   and   total  liabilities  of  $101,795.  Applicant’s  dischargeable  debts   were
discharged   on   February   1,  2016.   (Item   7)  After  the   discharge,  Applicant  continued   to
struggle financially.
In  response  to  DOHA  Interrogatories,  dated  January  18,  2021,  Applicant
authenticated  the  unsworn  summary  of  his  background  investigation  interview  as
accurate.  The  interview  was  held  June  8,  2020.  At  the  beginning  of  the  interview,
Applicant was asked twice whether he had any debts that were currently over 120 days
late. He answered, “No.” He was also asked twice whether he had any debts that were
over 120 days late since his bankruptcy. He again answered, “No.” He was also asked
twice  about  whether  he  had  any  repossessions.  He  answered,  “No.”  He  was  then
confronted with numerous delinquent accounts that were not included in his bankruptcy.
(Item 6) Applicant admitted to all of the delinquent accounts to include the two automobile
repossessions.  He  did  not  list  the  delinquent  accounts  on  his  security  clearance
application because he was not aware they were delinquent. His wife handles all of the
finances. The two car repossession debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f resulted from his
wife not making the car payments because she has a gambling addiction. The two cars
were repossessed in December 2017. Applicant believed that he would not owe anything
after the two cars were repossessed. His wife spends about $2,000 every two months on
gambling and refuses to let Applicant handle the finances. (Item 6 at 4-5)
Applicant believed that he did not need to pay any accounts that were charged off.
There was only one debt (SOR ¶ 1.b) that was not charged off. He claims he was unable
to make any payments towards this account because his employer and the union were
negotiating, which resulted in reduced work hours and pay. (Applicant provided no details
about the negotiations as well as specifics about his reduced pay and work hours.) (Item
7 at 7-11)
In   his  response   to   the   FORM,  Applicant   states  that   he   does  not  contest  the
allegations about  falsifying  his e-QIP  application. He  states  he  had  a  lack  of moral  and
ethical judgment,  but states he  “came  clean” when  he  spoke  to  the  investigator and  when
he  answered  the  interrogatories. He  requests  that his  security  clearance  not be  denied
due  to  one  moral and  ethical lapse  in  judgment.  Applicant admits his finances have  been
less  than   perfect.   He   reiterated   that   he   was  under  the   impression   that  the   automobile
repossessions were written  off. He admits that  he  did  not live  within his means for a  small
period  of  time. He has  not taken action towards any of these debts because  he is paying
his accounts that are in  good  standing. He has not incurred  additional debt.  (AE  A  at 1 -

In September 2021, Applicant was able to move to on-base housing, which allowed
his  rent  to  be  reduced  to  $1,500  a  month.  Other  monthly  payments  include:  $400  car
insurance; $240 family cell phone plan; $100 internet; $80 streaming services; $140 gas;
$400 groceries; and $100 miscellaneous. His total monthly expenses are approximately
$2,960.  (AE  B).  He  did  not  list  his  current  monthly  income,  but  mentioned  during  his
background  investigation  interview  that  his  monthly  income  was  $4,890.  (Item  6  at  5)
Based on this figure, he has approximately $1,930 left over each month after expenses.
Applicant states that although he is required to have a SECRET clearance to work
in his building, he never handles classified information. Applicant states that he is highly
respected by his supervisors and co-workers. He is trying to mitigate his financial issues
and is aware of the risks associated with financial difficulties. He would never engage in
espionage, subversion, or anything that would cause discredit upon himself, his job, or
his country. He requests that he be allowed to continue to have his security clearance.
