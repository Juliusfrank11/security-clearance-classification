In  Applicant’s SOR response, he  admitted  the SOR allegations  in ¶¶  1.a -1.d,  and
2.a  - 2.b.  He  denied  the  SOR allegations  in paragraphs  3.a  and  3.b  (Response  to  SOR).
At hearing, he  admitted  SOR ¶¶  1.e  and  2.b  as amended.  His admissions  are accepted
as findings of  fact.
Applicant is a 65-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from
high school and has some college credit, but no degree. He served on active duty in the
Navy from March 1986 to April 2009. After 23 years, he retired at the rank of E-8, senior
chief  petty  officer,  with  an  honorable  discharge.  While  in  the  Navy,  he  held  security
clearances at the Secret and Top Secret levels. He is divorced and has one adult son.
He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  since  April  2009  after  his  retirement  from  the
Navy. (Tr. 14-16, 24-25)
Alcohol Consumption
Alcohol concerns were raised  because  Applicant was arrested  and   convicted  of
DUI offenses  on  four occasions between  July  1995  to  September 1,  2018.  (SOR ¶¶  1.a
–  1.d) After the  SOR was issued, Applicant  was arrested  and  charged  with  DUI on  May
15, 2022. (SOR ¶ 1.e) The alcohol-related driving offenses are:
SOR ¶  1.a:  In July 1995, Applicant was arrested for DUI in [State 1]. He pled guilty
and received a fine. (Tr. 16; Gov 1 at 34; Gov 4 at 9) He does not recall the specifics of
this arrest. He was driving home alone from a bar. The police stopped him. He failed a
breathalyzer test. He was on active duty in the Navy at the time. The Navy was aware of
the arrest. (Tr. 26-28)
SOR ¶  1.b: On October 29, 2000, Applicant was arrested for DUI in [State 1]. He
pled  guilty  and  was  sentenced  to  three  days  in  jail,  a  $600  fine  and  his  license  was
suspended. (Tr. 17; Gov 1 at 34; Gov 4 at 9) Applicant and his roommate were driving to
get breakfast after drinking at a bar. A police officer stopped him. He took a breathalyzer,
but was not sure of the results. His license was suspended for one year. He reported this
offense to the Navy. (Tr. 28-30)
SOR ¶  1.c:   On April 30, 2011, Applicant was arrested for DWI in [State 2]. He pled
guilty and received a fine. (Tr. 17; Gov 4 at 10) He was staying at a hotel. He drove his
motorcycle back to the hotel after going to a sports bar. He had 3-4 alcoholic drinks at the
sports bar. When he pulled into the hotel parking lot, a police officer approached him and
asked to look at his helmet. The police officer smelled alcohol on Applicant’s breath and
asked if he had been drinking. Applicant took a breathalyzer at the police station. He was
over the legal limit. Applicant testified that he attended 20 hours of counseling. He told
his alcohol counselor that this was his third DUI arrest. He does not recall receiving an
alcohol diagnosis and was never advised to stop drinking alcohol. He reported his alcohol
arrest to his employer after his court conviction. (Tr. 31-35)
SOR ¶  1.d: On September 1, 2018, Applicant was arrested for DUI in [State 3]. He
pled  guilty  and  received  20  days  in  jail,  suspended;  a  $300  fine;  ordered  to  use  an
interlock device on his car for a period of one year; three years probation; and ordered to
attend alcohol counseling through the county health department. (Tr. 17-18; Gov 2 at 26;
Gov 3 at 26; Gov 4 at 2, 11; Gov 5; Gov 6)
Applicant’s  September  2018  arrest  occurred  on  the  Saturday  of  Labor  Day
weekend. He spent the day on a boat with friends. They would dock the boat at different
restaurants throughout the day to drink mixed alcoholic drinks and eat. Applicant does
not recall the number of alcoholic drinks he consumed during the day. He left the boat
around  6:30  or  7  pm.  He  went  to  a  restaurant  after  getting  off  the  boat.  He  stopped
drinking when he left the restaurant around 9 pm. While driving home, he rear-ended a
car that was turning left at an intersection. The passengers in the other car were not hurt.
Applicant  had  about  $500  damage  to  his  car. When  the  police  arrived  at  the  accident
scene, they smelled alcohol on Applicant’s breath. He failed a failed a field sobriety test.
A breathalyzer at the police station registered 0.16. (Tr. 35-39)
SOR ¶ 1.e: On May 15, 2021, Applicant was arrested for DUI in [State 3]. He pled
guilty  and  was  sentenced  to  60  days  in  jail,  suspended,  and  a  $250  fine.  He  lost  his
license for a period of one year. (Tr. 19, 53; Gov 7) At the time of his May 2021 arrest,
Applicant was still on probation related to his 2018 conviction for DUI. An officer observed
Applicant’s vehicle swerving over the line and pulled him over. Applicant admits drinking
about three or four alcoholic drinks before  the  arrest over a period of  three hours at a
restaurant. He refused to take a breathalyzer test because he did not want to take it.  He
claims he reported his arrest to his supervisor after he was convicted. (Tr. 40-43)
Appellant testified that he has never been  diagnosed  with  an alcohol disorder. N  o
one  has ever recommended  that he  abstain  from  alcohol.  He  never attended  Alcoholics
Anonymous  (AA)  meetings.  He  does  not  believe   he   is  an   alcoholic.  He  usually   drinks
alcohol   on   the   weekends.   He  usually   has  three   to   four  drinks  over  a   few   hours  at   a
restaurant.  He does not drink alcohol at home  unless he has company. Before 2009, his
alcohol  consumption  was higher while  he  served  in  the  Navy. Applicant testified  he  drank
alcohol on  average  of  five  to  six  times a  week. He has never tried  to  stop  drinking  alcohol.
He  realizes  that   he   should  stop   or  curtail   his  drinking.  Later,  he   testified   he   does  not
believe  he  needs to  stop  drinking. He just needs to  stop  making  stupid  decisions. (Tr. 48-
52)
Applicant’s  license  has  not  been  reinstated  yet.  It  has  been  over  a  year,  so  he
intends to request a hearing to have his license reinstated. He has not driven after drinking
alcohol since his May 2021, arrest for DUI. When he goes out, his friends drive him or he
takes  an  Uber.  The  last  time  he  went  out  drinking  was  the  Saturday  night  before  the
hearing. He has never reported to work while intoxicated. (Tr. 53- 54)
Criminal Conduct
Applicant’s five  DUI arrests were cross-alleged  under Criminal  Conduct.  (SOR ¶
1.b) A  May  27, 2002  arrest in [State  1] for operating  a  vehicle  with  a  suspended  license
was also alleged. For this offense, Applicant pled  guilty, was fined  $1,000,  and  served  48
hours in jail. Applicant was in the  process of  transferring  to  a  new  duty  location  in [State
3].  He  drove  from  [State  3]  to  [State1].  He  was pulled  over for having  a  tail  light out.  He
said  it was the  first and only time  that he drove on  a suspended license. He reported it to
the  Navy. He claims it did not violate  the  terms of  his probation. He  had  to  fly  back to
[State 3] to serve his 48-hour jail sentence. (SOR ¶ 2.a: Tr. 30-31; Gov 4 at 10)
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 3.a alleges that in response to Section 22, on his February 3, 2019, security
clearance application, “Have you ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol or
drugs?” Applicant answered, “Yes.”  He listed his September 2018 arrest for DUI. He is
alleged  to  have  deliberately  omitted  his  alcohol-related  arrests  in  July  1995,  October
2000, and April 2011, which are alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c.
SOR ¶ 3.b alleges that in response to Section 22, on his August 31, 2020, security
clearance application, “Have you ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol or
drugs?” Applicant answered, “Yes.”  He listed his September 2018 arrest for DUI. He is
alleged  to  have  deliberately  omitted  his  alcohol-related  arrests  in  July  1995,  October
2000, and April 2011, which are alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c.
Applicant testified that he misunderstood the question. He believed he was only
required to list alcohol offenses within the last seven years. Applicant listed his November
2000 and July 1995 arrests on his previous security clearance application  in 2009. He
believed  the  question  regarding  alcohol-related  offenses  in  Section  22  did  not  include
alcohol arrests that he previously disclosed. The government was on notice of Applicant’s
1995 and 2000 DUI arrests. (Tr. 20-22. 45-46; Gov 2, Section 22 at 33-34)
Applicant  found  the  e-QIP  security  clearance  applications  in  2019  and  2020
confusing. He never intended to falsify his security clearance applications. He listed his
2018 DUI offense in response to section 22 on both his 2019 and 2020 security clearance
applications.  He  did  not  list  his  2011  DUI  on  either  application.  This  coincides  with
Applicant’s mistaken belief that he did not have to list alcohol offenses that were more
than seven years old on his 2019 and his 2020 security clearance applications. I find SOR
¶¶  3.a  and  3.b  for  Applicant  because  he  did  not  intend  to  deliberately  withhold  these
offenses from the government. He misunderstood the question. (Tr. 21-22)
