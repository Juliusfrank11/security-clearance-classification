The  SOR alleges  that Applicant owes delinquent Federal income  taxes for tax  year
2014  in the  amount of  $11,386.07  (SOR ¶  1.a), and  he  failed  to  file  Federal and  State  A
income  taxes for tax  years 2016, 2017, 2018,  and  2019.  (SOR ¶¶  1.b  and  1.c)  He admitted
all  SOR  allegations  and  stated  this situation  developed  due  to  him  not  considering  this
matter to  be  a  priority  and  procrastination. In  his response  to  the  SOR he  stated  that he
was in the process of remedying this matter. (Items  1-4)
Applicant completed an interrogatory on April 15, 2021, concerning the accuracy
of  a  report of  his  background  interview  conducted  on  August  25,  2020,  and  questions
about his Federal and state income taxes. He verified that the report of his interview with
an authorized DOD investigation was accurate. He had reported to the investigator that
he had not filed any income tax returns for 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019. In the interrogatory,
however, he listed that he had filed both a Federal and State A income tax return for 2016,
but  he  had  not  yet  filed  his 2020  Federal income tax return.  He  was  asked to  provide
supporting documentation with the interrogatory. Applicant provided IRS transcripts for
tax years 2014, 2017, 2018, and 2019. The IRS tax transcripts showed he had not filed
federal income tax returns for tax years 2017, 2018, and 2019. He did not provide any
State A income tax documentation. He provided no proof of payments or an established
payment plan with any tax authority, or  that he had recently filed any of the Federal or
State A income tax returns alleged in the SOR. (Item 4)
