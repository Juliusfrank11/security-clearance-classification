Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a DoD contractor who seeks eligibility to
hold  a  public  trust  position.  (Tr.  22)  Allegations  covered  in  the  SOR  and  admitted  by
Applicant  are  incorporated  and  adopted  as  relevant  and  material  findings.  Additional
findings follow.
Background
Applicant has never been married and has no children. (GEs 1-2)) She earned a
bachelor’s  degree  in  poultry  science  in  May  2009  and  another  bachelor’s  degree  in
business administration and health care in May 2000. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 22, 46-47) Applicant
enlisted in the U.S. Army in January 1996 and served four years of active duty and four
years  of  inactive  reserve  duty  in  the  Army’s  Inactive  Reserve.  Applicant  received  an
honorable discharge in January 2004. (GE 1)
Since October 2021, Applicant has been employed by her current employer (the
same employer she worked for between November 2011 and April 2017). (GE 1; Tr. 66)
She  has  been  sponsored  by  her  employer  pending  the  outcome  of  her  public  trust
eligibility  application.  Between  February  2020  and  October  2021,  and  between  April
2017 and September 2018, she reported mostly experiencing unemployment, and relied
on  her  savings  and  part-time  earnings  to  fund  her  necessities.  (GE  1;  Tr.  60,  67).
Overall, Applicant characterized her employment between April 2017 and October 2021
as unsteady. (Tr. 66-67)
Between November 2011 and April 2017, Applicant was employed by a defense
contractor  (and  current  employer)  supporting  U.S.  combat  troops  in  a  Middle  East
country as a quality analyst. (GE 1 and AE D; Tr. 47-48, 59-60) After losing her analyst
job following her employer’s loss of its Government contract in April 2017, she could not
find  gainful  work  for  many  months.  To  support  herself,  she  accepted  low-paying  field
inspector  jobs  on  an  independent  contractor  basis  between  September  2018  and
October 2021. (GE 1 and AE D; Tr. 23) Between December 2004 and November 2011,
Applicant worked as a test proctor for a non-defense employer. (GE 1 and AE D)
Applicant’s finances
Citing unemployment and underemployment, and a desire to save her home from
foreclosure, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in May 2019. (GEs 4 and 6-7;
Tr. 28-29) In her petition, she listed total assets of $186,636 (inclusive of her residence
valued  at  $174,655)  and  liabilities  of  $220,650.  (GE  6)  Applicant  scheduled  secured
claims  totaling  $158,400  (consisting  of  the  mortgage  on  her  home  that  called  for
monthly  payments  of  $1,164)  and  unsecured  claims  (mostly  credit  cards)  totaling
$62,150. (GE 6; Tr. 30-31, 55, 61-62) Applicant’s bankruptcy petition was discharged as
a no-asset bankruptcy in August 2019. (GEs 2 and 6-7)
Following  her  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  discharge  in  August  2019,  Applicant
continued  to  encounter  financial  difficulties  over  her  efforts  to  save  her  home  from
foreclosure and public sale of her residence. While unemployed, she fell behind in her
mortgage  payments  and  attempted  unsuccessfully  to  obtain  a  loan  modification.  (GEs
1-2) Facing limited financial resources, she petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief in
October  2019.  (GE  5) Unable  to  prevent  the  sale  of  her  home,  she  acquiesced  in  the
dismissal of her Chapter 13 petition without ever finalizing an approved payment plan.
(Tr.  65-66)  Court  records  confirm  the  dismissal  of  Applicant’s  Chapter  13  bankruptcy
petition  in  March  2021.  (GE  5)  The  foreclosure  of  Applicant’s  mortgage  did  not  leave
any deficiency balance. (Tr. 34, 66)
While working  in a  Middle East country  for her current employer supporting  U.S.
combat  troops  between   2011   and   2017,  Applicant  obtained   extensions  from   the   IRS
that   extended   the   required   times   for  filing   her  federal  tax   returns   for  tax   years  2013-
2017.  (AEs  H-1,  H-2,  and   L;  Tr.  49-50) When   her employer’s  contract  expired   in  April
2017,  she   was  separated   and   received   an   exit  bonus  from   her  then   and   current
employer in the  amount of  $10,000. (Tr. 48)
While  employed abroad  (2011-2017), Applicant  regularly filed for extensions for
those  tax  years.  (Tr.  49-54)  Once  she  returned  to  the  United  States  in  2017,  she
retained a tax professional with expertise in tax filing for overseas clients. She retained
this  tax  professional  specifically  to  help  her  with  filing  her  federal  tax  returns  for  the
2013-2017  tax  years,  which  she  did  in  late  2017.  (HEs  1-3;  Tr.  49-53)  For  these
combined  tax  years,  she  accrued  estimated  tax  deficiencies  totaling  $17,695  for  the
combined  years.  This  calculated  deficiency  balance  included  imposed  interest  and
penalties.  (GE 2; Tr. 54) For tax years 2018 and 2019,  Applicant has filed  her returns
timely, as required. (HEs 1-3 and AEs H-1 and H-2; Tr. 53-54)
Addressing  her  delinquent  federal  taxes  for  tax  years  2013-2017),  Applicant
entered into an installment agreement with the IRS in August 2021. (AE I; Tr. 44, 68-69)
Her agreement followed months of her exchanges of information with the IRS, as a part
of  her concerted  efforts  to  resolve  her assessed  tax deficiencies.  (HEs  1-3; Tr. 44-45)
Once the IRS ceased to recognize her ensuing unemployment following her April 2017
employment separation, she moved swiftly with the aid of  her tax professional to work
out an installment agreement with the IRS. (Tr. 44-45)
Under  the  terms  of  her  June  2021  installment  agreement,  Applicant  obligated
herself to making monthly payments of $264. (AE I-1 and J-1-J-4) Three months later in
November 2021,  Applicant  completed a  revised  installment agreement  with  the IRS  to
cover an additional tax year. (AEs I-2; Tr. 69-70) Payment terms under her revised IRS
agreement called for increased monthly payments of $284. (AEs I-2; Tr. 45) Applicant’s
payment  receipts  document  her  making  the  required  regular  monthly  payments  and
staying in compliance with her agreement. (AEs I-2 and (J-1-J-13; Tr. 45-46)
Over  the   course   of  past   three   years,  Applicant  has   managed   her   finances
responsibly  and  is current with  her creditors, while  avoiding  using  her credit cards.  (Tr.
37)  She   currently   earns  around   $76,000   a   year  (a  considerable   reduction   from   the
$118,000  she  earned  from  the  same  employer before her separation  in April 2017.  (AE
K;  Tr.  47,  68)  She   has  title   loans  and   student  loans  that  are  either  paid  in   full   or  in
payment  compliance   with   her  lenders.  (AEs   O-1   and  O-2; Tr. 38) And, her car is paid
off.
For help in improving the management of her finances, Applicant completed on-
line  classes  in  January  2022  in  financial  recovery,  money  matters,  and  borrowing
losses.  (AEs  J1-J3).  Lessons  learned  and  applied  to  the  handling  of  her  debts  and
accounts are difficult to assess without more evidence.
In   Applicant’s   personal  financial  statement,   she   reported   net  monthly   income   of
$5,355  and  monthly  expenses (inclusive  of her IRS  payments) of  $3,748.  (AE  K; Tr.  39-
41, 58-59) Applicant reported  a  monthly  remainder of  $1,606. (AE  K; Tr. 40) She  has a
401(k)   retirement  fund   with   approximately   $10,000   in  the   fund   and   a   savings  account
with   $10,000   in   the  account   that  is much   less  than   the  $25,000   she   maintained   in her
savings account before  her loss of employment in April 2017. (Tr. 56) Her housing  costs
are covered by her current employer. (Tr. 39)
Endorsements and performance  evaluations.
Applicant  is  well-regarded  by  her  friends  who  know  her  well  and  find  her  to  be
reliable  and  trustworthy.  (AEs  F-1  and  F-2)  Applicant’s  performance  evaluations  for
2014 and 2015 (while employed abroad) credit her with exceeds requirements ratings in
most  rating  categories  in  each  of  her  evaluations.  (AE  E)  Categories  in  which  she
achieved  exceeds  requirements  ratings  include  attendance,  job  knowledge,  quality  of
work, reliability, and values. (AE E)
