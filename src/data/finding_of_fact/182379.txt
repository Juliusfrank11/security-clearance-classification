Applicant is 58 years old. She has been married to her husband since 1995, and
they have three daughters who are young adults. She received a high school diploma in
1982. She currently works as an administrative specialist,  and she has worked for her
current  employer,  a  DOD  contractor  since  2011.  She  has  held  a  secret  security  since
1982, and has worked for DOD contractors her entire career. (Tr.10-11, 16-19; GE 1)
In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, she denied the $22,703 mortgage debt alleged
in SOR ¶ 1.a. She admitted both her 2008 and 2016 Chapter 7 bankruptcies. Additionally,
she  admitted  that  she  failed  to  disclose  her  2016  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  to  her  facility
security officer (FSO), as required.
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a was a home equity loan opened in March 2007, for
Applicant’s  current  primary  residence.  At  the  hearing,  she  testified  that  this  debt  was
included  in  her  2008  Chapter  7  bankruptcy;  however,  the  bankruptcy  documentation
indicates  the  debt  was  reaffirmed  at  that  time.  In  her  post-hearing  documentation,
Applicant provided documentation from the creditor demonstrating that this debt was paid
in  full  in  April  2018.  At  that  time,  the  mortgage  was  released,  and  the  release  was
recorded with the county. (Tr. 26-31, 40-43; GE 2 at 37; GE 3 at 23; GE 4 at 9; AE A; AE

Applicant’s financial issues started in late 2007.  Her husband has been an over
the road (OTR) truck driver for most of his adult life. In 2007, they purchased a semi-truck
for him to become an owner/operator. Soon after they purchased the tractor trailer, the
vehicle required repairs. Additionally, the fuel for the vehicle was very expensive, which
left very little money in their budget for food, gas, or other unexpected bills. During this
period, Applicant’s company lost the contract she was working on as well. Therefore, they
decided to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. Their total unsecured liabilities were
just  under  $83,000.  Their  debts  were  discharged  in  2010,  and  she  disclosed  this
bankruptcy to her FSO, as required. (Tr. 19-22, 25, 39; GE 2; GE 7; AE A; AE B)
In  2016,  Applicant’s  husband  told  her  he  wanted  a  divorce.  She  went  to  see  a
divorce attorney, and after reviewing her debts and her income, he told her she could not
afford to remain in her marital home with her three children. At that time, her daughters
were between the ages of 14 and 19. Applicant’s husband’s attorney recommended that
they discharge their debts through bankruptcy before filing for divorce. They followed her
husband’s attorney’s advice  and  filed  for Chapter 7  bankruptcy  in  August,  2016. Their
unsecured  liabilities  totaled  just  over  $45,000,  and  their  debts  were  discharged  in
December,  2016.  Applicant  and   her  husband   chose   to   work  on   their  marriage   and
ultimately  did not get divorced. (Tr. 22-25; GE  3; GE 7; AE A; AE B)
In 2016, Applicant disclosed her financial issues and bankruptcy to her supervisor,
because she needed to take time off of work for various appointments.  However, she did
not  report  the  bankruptcy  to  her  FSO  due  to  “personal  humiliation,  embarrassment,
[related to her] husband…asking for a divorce.” At that time, she was more comfortable
disclosing her personal information to her supervisor than to her FSO. Additionally, she
was embarrassed that she was filing for bankruptcy a second time. (Tr. 31-32, 38-39; GE
7; AE A)
I’ve  worked with these  people, or those people at the time, for many years.
I was just  humiliated. I  still  wasn’t sure if we  were going  to  stay  married. It
was just bad judgment on  my part, that’s all I  can say. (Tr. 32)
Applicant’s  supervisor  recommended  that  she  hold  off  on  reporting  the  2016
bankruptcy to their FSO until she was certain that she was going to file. “And then things
got away from [Applicant] until the investigator came to interview [her]” in December 2019.
She disclosed the 2016 bankruptcy to the investigator at that time, and it appears that
she did so before being confronted. She recognizes she made a serious mistake in not
reporting  the  2016  bankruptcy  to  her  FSO,  and  she  will  not  make  a  similar  lapse  in
judgment. This is the lone mistake she has made in her 30-year career working as a DOD
contractor. (Tr. 33, 46; GE 7; AE A; AE B)
Applicant does not have any current delinquent debt. She and her husband each
earn  approximately  $62,000  annually.  They  follow  a  written  budget  and  have  a  net
monthly remainder of over $3,200. They are able to live within their means and pay their
bills. They have filed their state and federal tax returns in a timely manner the past five
years and do not owe any state or federal tax debt. She has attended credit counseling
in conjunction with both of her bankruptcy filings. (Tr. 25-26; 34-37; GE 2; GE 3; GE 6;
AE B; AE F)
Applicant testified  and  provided  a  letter  regarding  the  importance  of   her lengthy
career  working   for  DOD  contractors.  According   to   her   last   two   employee   performance
evaluations,  she   is  considered   a   valued   employee   who   is  reliable  and   consistently
exceeds  expectations.   “She   is  quick  to   bring   any   security   concerns  or   issues   to   our
attention, which greatly reduces the  opportunity  for a  security  incident.” (Tr. 33, 46;  AE  B-
D).
