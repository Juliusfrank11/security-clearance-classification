Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. She is 63 years old. She married in
1981,  divorced  in  1991,  remarried  in  1992,  divorced  in  2000,  remarried  in  2003,  and
divorced  in  2006.  She  has  an  adult  daughter  and  three  adult  grandchildren.  She
graduated from high school in 1977 and attended college but did not earn a degree. She
has owned her home since 1999. (Answer; Tr. at 7, 21-23; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  has worked  for various  DOD contractors  since  approximately  2000.  She
was unemployed  in 2013.  After a  layoff,  she  was again  unemployed  from  December  2014
to  January  2015. She  then  worked  part time, as a  designer for an  event center, from  May
2015   to   February   2016,  when   she   was  again  laid   off.   She   was  unemployed   from
November 2015  to  April 2016.  Since 2016 and  as  of the  date  of the hearing, she  worked
as an  information  specialist for her employer, a  DOD contractor.  She  has also worked
part  time, as  a  cashier  at an  arts and  crafts store, since  2007.   She  was first granted  a
security  clearance  in  approximately  September 2011. (Tr. at  7-9, 23-24, 26-27, 29, 53-
54; GE 1, 2)
The   SOR  alleged   that   Applicant  failed   to   file   her   federal  and   state   income   tax
returns for at least tax  years (TY) 2014  through  2018  (SOR ¶¶  1.a, 1.b).  The  SOR  also
alleged  that Applicant had  three  delinquent consumer accounts totaling  $42,609  (SOR ¶¶
1.c,  1.d,  1.e).   The   SOR  allegations  are  established   by   Applicant’s  admissions   in  her
Answer, March 2018  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  2018  and  2019  background
interviews, 2020 response to interrogatories, and credit bureau reports from 2018, 2019,
and  2021.  SOR debts ¶¶  1.c through  1.e  are reported  on  the  2018  and  2019  credit bureau
reports, and  SOR debt  ¶  1.d  is reported  on  the  2021  credit bureau  report.  SOR debts ¶¶
1.c through  1.e are not  reported  on  her most  recent  credit  bureau  report from  May  2022.
(Answer; GE 1-5; AE A)
Applicant  attributed  her  inability  to  timely  file  her  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns  for  TY  2013  to  2016  to  two  roof  leaks  in  her  home,  in  2013  and  2016,  which
damaged  documentation  she  needed  to  file  her  relevant  income  tax  returns.  She  was
overwhelmed with having to pay approximately $600 in 2014 and $1,000 in 2016 to repair
her roof, as well as with reconstructing the documentation she needed to file her relevant
income tax returns. She did not seek help with reconstructing her tax documentation, and
she did not think to attempt to do so online; rather, she corresponded with her creditors
by  telephone  and  mail.  She  consequently  did  not  provide  her  tax  preparer  with  the
required documentation so that her tax preparer could timely file her income tax returns
for  TY  2013  to  2018.  She  acknowledged  during  her  October  16,  2018  background
interview that her inability to pay her tax advisor also affected her ability to file her income
tax returns since 2013. She testified that she also did not timely file her federal and state
income tax returns for TY 2019 and 2020, because she was waiting for her tax preparer
to first file her income tax returns for TY 2013 to 2018. (Answer; Tr. at 26, 34-53, 60-62;
GE 1, 2)
Applicant  testified  that  she  has  worked  with  a  tax  advisor  since  approximately
2009. She testified that her tax preparer filed her federal and state income tax returns for
TY 2013 to 2018 in June 2021, and her federal and state income tax returns for TY 2019
and 2020 in August 2021. She did not provide corroborating documentation. She testified
that she was unsure how much she owed in federal taxes; she believed she owed $2,000
in state taxes; and her tax preparer was assisting her with negotiating payment plans with
both the IRS and the state tax authority to resolve any outstanding taxes. She testified
that as of the date of the hearing, all of her federal and state income tax returns had been
filed. She also testified that she expected to pay taxes on money she withdrew from her
individual retirement account (IRA) in 2016 when she was unemployed, and in 2022 to
repair her roof. (Tr. at 42-53, 61-62, 65; GE 2; AE A)
Applicant  attributed  her  delinquent  consumer  debts  to  the  above-mentioned
periods  of  unemployment;  four unexpected  car  repairs  from  around  2014  to  2018  that
cost between $200 and $800; $1,800 in medical expenses related to a dental condition
between  2014  and  2018,  and  an  immune  system  disorder  diagnosed  in  around  2016;
replacement of her HVAC system in 2020, for which she was on a $300 monthly payment
plan as of the date of the hearing; and providing needed financial assistance to both her
mother and her daughter. (Answer; Tr. at 26, 34-44, 53-54, 59, 65-66; GE 1, 2)
Applicant testified that she attempted to work with her creditors from approximately
2015  to  2018  to  resolve  her  delinquent  consumer  debts,  but  she  made  little  progress
because  she  could  only  make  nominal  monthly  payments  while  interest  continued  to
accrue.  On  the  advice  of  her bank,  she  consulted  with  Accelerated  Financial  Services
(AFS) in January 2014 in an attempt to resolve her delinquent debts. In October 2018,
she  entered  her  three  consumer  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  1.d,  and  1.e,  into  a  debt
consolidation plan with AFS. She also included in her debt consolidation plan four debts
that are not alleged in the SOR. She testified that she paid approximately $1,500 monthly
into her debt consolidation plan for one year, and then $50 monthly since. Documentation
from AFS reflects that Applicant has made timely payments into her plan. (Tr. at 29-34,
54-60, 63; GE 1, 2; AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.c is for a $13,402 charged-off account. Applicant testified that although
this debt was no longer reported on her most recent credit bureau report, she intended to
resolve it through her debt consolidation plan with AFS. (Tr. at 54-56; GE 5; AE A)
SOR  ¶   1.d   is  for  a   $17,101   charged-off   credit  card.   As   previously   discussed,
Applicant included  this  debt  in her debt consolidation  plan  with  AFS. An  IRS  Form 1099-
C reflects  that  the  creditor cancelled  this  credit card  debt  in  December 2019.  (GE  5; AE
A)
SOR  ¶   1.e   is  for  a   $12,106   charged-off   credit  card.   As   previously   discussed,
Applicant included  this  debt  in her debt consolidation  plan  with  AFS. An  IRS  Form 1099-
C reflects that the  creditor cancelled  this credit card  debt  in December 2017. (Tr. at 58;
GE 5; AE A)
As of the date of the hearing, Applicant’s net monthly income was approximately
$4,500.  She  also  earned  $12.25  hourly  from  her  part-time  employment,  where  she
worked 12 hours weekly as of the date of the hearing. She testified that her monthly net
remainder, after expenses, was $100. She was seeking additional part-time employment
in an effort to resolve her debts, to include her outstanding taxes. She had $7,000 in her
IRA that she had been contributing to since 2016. She testified that she did not use credit
cards.  She  testified  that  she  was  current  on  her  mortgage,  for  which  she  paid  $1,400
monthly. She also testified that she developed a budget for her income and expenses,
and she understood the importance of timely filing her future federal and state income tax
returns. She has not received credit counseling. She traveled to Jamaica for tourism in
June 2009 and June 2011, and she also traveled to Mexico for tourism in June 2011. (Tr.
