Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR in his November 2020 answer
to the SOR. In his supplemental answer to the SOR, he admitted ¶¶ 1a, 1.b, 1.c, and 2.a.
He denied SOR ¶ 1.d based on dates alleged. After a thorough and careful review of the
pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 37 years old. He married in 2015 and has four children under the age
of five years. He earned a bachelor’s  degree in 2007 and master’s degree  in 2015. He
has worked for federal contractors since approximately 2011 and his present employer
since 2019. He has held a security clearance since approximately 2011. (Tr. 15-22; GE
1; AE B, D, E)
Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from February 2004 to April 2017.
He  testified  that from  2004  to  2006,  while  in  college,  he  used  marijuana  less  than  ten
times. He used marijuana once in June 2009, while on a camping trip. He did not use
marijuana from June 2009 to June 2016. He illegally purchased marijuana one time in
2016. He cooked this marijuana in brownies to eat. He used marijuana from June 2016
to  February  2017,  about  five  to  seven  times,  while  holding  a  security  clearance.  His
explanation for using it was he was dealing with anxiety, sleep issues, and a back injury.
His doctor had prescribed medication, but he did not like taking the drugs because they
made him groggy. He used marijuana as a muscle relaxer. He now infrequently takes a
prescribed medication for stress, anxiety, and sleep issues that has minimal side effects.
He testified the last time he used marijuana was February 2017. (Answer to SOR; GE 4;
Tr. 23-30)
Applicant used  the  prescription  drugs Adderall and  Ritalin  from  May  2012  to  2019.
These  drugs were not prescribed  to  him. He got the  drugs from  a  friend. He was unaware
this was inappropriate  and  was not overly  concerned  using  these  drugs. He swapped  his
prescribed  Xanax  with  a  friend  who  had  Adderall  and  Ritalin. He infrequently  used  it while
attending   college   and   later  night  school  in  2015,  while   earning   his   master’s  degree   or
when  completing  a  big  project to  help  him  be  more  focused.  He  estimated  he  used  his
friend’s prescription  drugs about  five  or  less  times  and  did  not  take  a  whole pill. He  no
longer has contact with this friend since Applicant moved to  a  new state  in 2019  that is a
long  distance  away. His doctor was unaware he  was using  these  drugs. (Tr. 30-32,  40-
45,48-50; GE  4)
Applicant voluntarily disclosed his drug use on his security clearance applications
(SCA)  in  2011,  2018,  and  again  in  2020.  He  indicated  to  the  investigator  during  his
background interview that he does not intend to use any illegal drug or drug that is not
prescribed to him in the future. He provided a signed written statement  that he will not
use  illegal  drugs  in  the  future  and  acknowledging  future  involvement  may  result  in
revocation  of  his  clearance.  He  also  indicated  in  writing  that  he  is  willing  to  submit  to
random and scheduled drug testing. (Tr. 32-34; GE 1, 2, 3; AE G)
Applicant  fully  understands  that  illegal  drug  use  is  inconsistent  with  holding  a
security clearance. He understands this is regardless of whether he actually has access
to classified information. (Tr. 35-36, 43)
After the birth of his first child in 2017, Applicant made a conscious decision that
he must set an example for his children and illegal drug use was inconsistent with the
model he wanted to represent. He is a different person since becoming a parent. He felt
it  was  more  important  to  be  honest  in  disclosing  his  past  drug  use  than  to  hide  it  and
although  disclosure was  required,  it was  also  the  right  thing to do.  He  does not regret
being honest. He admitted he made errors in judgment that are in his past and has thought
about the negative impact his past drug use could have on his family and his career. He
asked for another chance. (Tr. 35-37)
Character witnesses testified on Applicant’s behalf. They described him as honest,
honorable, prodigious, forthright, disciplined, and trustworthy. They would never question
his integrity. He is a devoted family man and father. He is devoted to his faith and is part
of a team at his church. His supervisor testified that Applicant is highly respected at work
for his attention to detail, and he ensures the project is completed on schedule. All but his
wife, who testified for him, hold security clearances. All expressed they had no concerns
about Applicant holding a security clearance. (Tr. 52-91)
