Applicant denied both allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  47  years old.  He  has  not  been married  and has  two  adult  children,
ages 24 and 25. He has been employed by his present employer since 2017.
The  financial  allegations  alleged  in  the  SOR  are  supported  by  Applicant’s
statements in his May 2018 security clearance application (SCA), his answer to the SOR,
his statements made to a government investigator in May 2019, and credit bureau reports
(CBR) from November 2021 and August 2018. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  Applicant  has  child-support  arrearages
totaling
approximately  $39,884.  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  explained  that  the  same
child-support  arrearage  currently  alleged  was  previously  adjudicated  at  a  security
clearance hearing in 2010, at which time the balance was $28,000. At  that hearing, he
presented evidence that he had established a payment plan to address the debt in which
$400 would be automatically withheld from his monthly wages, with $247 directed to his
ongoing child-support obligation and $153 applied to the arrearage. The decision implies
that the Income Withholding Order was recently established, and Applicant had not yet
made any payments as of the May 2010 hearing. Since the decision, the arrearages have
grown to the alleged amount. (Items 6, 8)
Applicant disclosed in his May 2018 SCA that he is paying the minimum amount
required  on  his debt, and  he  is attempting  to  have  it  recalculated.  He  explained  in  his
SOR answer that his child-support payments have been automatically withheld from his
wages for many years, but those payments are not reflected in the balance on his credit
report.  In  Applicant’s  response  to  the  FORM,  he  provided  a  copy  of  the  Income
Withholding for Support letter sent to his employer in August 2012 requesting $267 be
withheld for child support and $67 be withheld for past-due child support. In support of his
payment efforts, he provided a paystub from one employer for October 2013 that reflected
a year-to-date total paid of $3,083. He provided two paystubs from a different employer
from November 2013 and December 2013 that shows the year-to-date amount paid was
$1,370.  In  his  SOR  answer,  he  did  not  provide  any  other  documentation  of  payments
since 2010. In addition, he provided a document to show his children were enrolled in
school in 2013 and he was listed as the parent on their  school forms. He provided the
same documents in his response to the FORM. (Items 3; AE I, J)
Applicant provided a copy of an email from March 2016, presumably from the case
worker for the state where the child support court order was entered. It stated that the
state did not add interest to Applicant’s child support arrears. The amount accrued is the
actual court-ordered amount. The email stated:
We  have  not received  any  payments from  you  since  October 1, 2013  when
the   employer  at  the   time   quit  withholding.   We   did  receive   a   $978.35
payment  in June  2015  as a  result of  a  hit  on  your bank  account.  I cannot
negotiate  any  amount as long  as there  is a  valid  court  order in effect,  which
there is until [child] emancipates in [M]ay. After that,  I would be  in agreement
with   the   $250   per  month.  I  have   received   a   notice   that  a   check   will   be
coming  in for $350  around [M]arch 21st. Thank you for setting  that up. I will
go  through  your case  and  see  what months the  support may  be  able to  be
removed   due   to   you   having   the   children.  I  will   do   an   updated   affidavit  of
arrears and send it out to you. (AE F)
Applicant provided receipts to show he made payments of $250 in April 2016 and
May 2016 and payments of $150 in February 2017, March 2017 and January 2018. The
receipts say they were  paid by auto pay, but I am unable to determine if  the  auto pay
stopped after May 2016 because the amount was reduced, indicating there was a change.
He did not provide proof of consecutive payments. He did not provide other evidence to
show  payments  made  since  his  2010  hearing,  other  than  the  2013  payments  made
through his employer. (AE A through E, G, H, I)
Applicant  has  repeatedly   said  that  he   made   child-support  payments  to   different
states  that  did  not  give  him  credit;  that  his children  lived  with  him  for  years  so  he  should
not have  been  paying  child  support;  and  that he  should be  given  credit for air  fare he  paid
for the  children. He did  not  provide  evidence  that he  followed  up  with  the  case  worker in
the  state  where the  child-support order was issued  to  request an  adjustment or request a
recalculation. If one was made, he did not provide it to show the current amount owed  or
if  the  balance  was satisfied. He provided  a  “child  support collections” document from  a
different state  from  May  2001, which reflected  that $7,242  would be  garnished  from  his
wages  through   his   employer at the   time.   It   is  unknown   if  this occurred   or how   long  he
worked  for his employer. He claims he  made  payments from  2001  to  2009  to  a  different
state   that  were  never  deducted.  However,  when   he   had   his  2010   hearing,  he   had   a
substantial amount of  child  support in arrears.  He further stated  that he  has tried  to  correct
the  child-support  issues since  2001, but  has been  unable because  he  does not  have  an
attorney  in the  state  where the  order was issued  to  petition  the  court and  it is a  financial
burden to travel there.  (AE K)
Applicant provided with his response to the FORM, a state tax document from 2014
that shows  he received  unemployment compensation during that tax year. In his 2018
SCA,  he  does  not  list  any  period  of  unemployment  for  2014.  He  disclosed  he  was
employed from September 2013 to January 2014 and changed jobs and was employed
from February 2014 to January 2017.1
Applicant  denied  owing  the  medical  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  ($1,071).  He
disclosed this debt on his 2018 SCA and noted he believed he was double-billed by his
insurance  company  for  a  back  brace.  He  believes  the  device  was  covered  by  his
insurance benefits. He stated that he was in the process of having the collection account
removed from his CBR. In his May 2019 interview with a government investigator, he said
the debt should have been covered by his insurance company. The debt was incurred in
approximately  December  2014.  He  said  the  issue  was  between  the  medical  supply
company and his insurance company. He was waiting for them to resolve it, but he did
not  believe  he  was  responsible  for  this  debt.  In  his  response  to  the  FORM,  Applicant
provided numerous insurance documents. The debt is not reported on the 2018 or 2021
CBRs. Based on the evidence, Applicant has a legitimate dispute and has been battling
the insurance companies to resolve it. I find for him on his allegation.  (Item 4; AE K, M
through AA)
