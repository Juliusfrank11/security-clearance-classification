she  was 18  years old  and  earning  $7.25  an  hour  working  in a  retail establishment. (Tr.
19-22) A  drug  distributor promised  to  pay  her  $1,500,  and  in return, she  agreed  to  import
an  illegal drug  into  the  United  States. (Tr. 19-21; HE 3) She left  the  United  States and
went to  Jamaica  with  the  intention  of  bringing  illegal drugs into  the  United  States.  (Tr. 19-

(Tr. 24) Applicant exited  her vehicle, and  a  physical altercation  between  Applicant,  her
sister, and  three  women  occurred. (Tr. 24; HE  3) Applicant’s sister helped  Applicant get
back into  her vehicle. Applicant  said she  was innocent of the  charges because  of  self-
defense; however, her attorney advised her to plead guilty because she was a convicted
felon. (Tr. 24; HE 3) Her  sister went to  trial and  was acquitted. (Tr. 24; HE 3) Applicant
completed  a six-month  anger-management  class in 2012. (Tr. 27; HE 3)
The police report states:
[Applicant]  intentionally  struck the  [victim] against  her will and  in doing  so
caused  harm  (abrasions cuts and  bruising). [Applicant]  used  closed  fists in
the   incident.   [Applicant]   then   using   a   motor vehicle   intentionally   used   the
vehicle   as  a   deadly   weapon   driving   at  and   striking   the   victim   with   the
vehicle. [Applicant] then turned the vehicle  around and  drove the vehicle at
the  [victim] as she  lay  on  the  ground. Victim  was pulled  out of  the  path  of
[Applicant’s] vehicle. (GE 5  at 11)

SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  in  January  2019,  Applicant  was  charged  in  state  court  with
public  assistance  fraud  ($200  or  more),  a  3rd  degree  felony,  between  April  2015  and
December 2016.  (HE 2)  She  was  arrested  in  February 2019.  In  September 2019,  she
pleaded  nolo  contendere  to  the  charge  and  received  deferred  adjudication.  She  was
sentenced  to  pay  $11,202  in  restitution,  to  complete  an  anti-theft  class,  and  to  be  on
probation until September 2024.
Applicant admitted  the  charge, pleas, and  sentence  described  in  SOR ¶¶  1.c  and
1.d.  (HE  3)  In  November 2014, she  went on  paid maternity  leave  from  her employment
because  of  the  birth  of  her third  child. (Tr. 29) In  2015, her son’s father moved  out,  and
she  applied  for public assistance. (Tr. 29; HE  3) She  started  receiving  public assistance
in March 2015.  (Tr. 30) In  April 2015, she  returned  to  her employment from  which she
took maternity  leave. (Tr. 31) She  failed  to  accurately  report her employment  income, and
she  continued  to  receive  public assistance. (Tr. 31; GE  6; HE 3) In  October 2015, she  left
her employment,  and  she  went to  work for a  temporary  staffing  agency. (Tr. 32, 34) On
November 23, 2015, Applicant provided  a  pay  stub  showing  bi-weekly  pay  of  $540. (Tr.
35; GE 7  at 12) She  did  not submit the  information  about pay  she  received  from  another
employer.  (Tr.  35)  Again  on   December  3,  2015,  she   provided   a   pay   stub   from   one
employer, but not the  other employer. (Tr. 35-36) Applicant said someone  told  her that
she   did  not  have   to   disclose   income   from   temporary   employment  because   the
employment  might  be   for  only   one   month.   (Tr.  37-39)  She   acknowledged   that  she
received  incorrect information  from  someone  about the  income that was supposed to  be
disclosed. (Tr. 38-39) She  said she  did  not feel at the  time  of  the  receipt  of funds that  she
was fraudulently receiving funds from the government. (Tr. 40)
Applicant said she still qualified for public assistance because of her income level,
three children, and not receiving child support. (Tr. 32, 39; GE 1; GE 2) She stated in her
SCA that even with her new employment she would have still qualified for the assistance.
(GE 1 at 44) She told the OPM investigator she did not report her total income “because
her income would [have] still qualified her for the assistance.” (GE 2 at 2) At her hearing,
she said she believed the annual income threshold for receiving benefits was $50,000 or
$60,000. (Tr. 41)
The  state  investigator indicated  Applicant and  her dependents “received  $6,167.00
in excessive  Food  Stamp  Benefits to  which they  were not legally  entitled, during  the  period
of   May   2015   through   May   2016,”  and   they   “received   $5,035.02   in  excessive   Medicaid
Benefits to  which they  were not legally  entitled  during  the  period  November 2015  through
December  2016,  for  an   aggregate   of  $11,202.02   which  was  obtained   by   fraudulent
means.” (GE  7  at 15) At her hearing, she  conceded  she  was not really  sure whether her
statements  were accurate  about  her total  income  not  causing  her  to  be  disqualified  from
receiving  public assistance. (Tr. 43-44)
From April 3, 2015 to October 1, 2015, Applicant received a salary of $19,827. (Tr.
32-33; GE 7 at 12) From March 2015 to December 2016, she submitted pay stubs totaling
$7,737, and during that time period, she received total income of $89,000. (Tr. 33)
After  pleading   guilty,  she   paid  the   court-ordered   restitution   of  $11,202   for  food
stamps and  Medicaid  and $5,076 for school readiness services; she  completed  the  anti-
theft  class;  and  her probation  was terminated  on  June  29, 2020. (Tr. 42; HE 3; GE  7  at 6-
9)
Applicant’s current annual income  is $81,000, and  her husband’s annual income
is about $90,000. (Tr.  42) They do not have  any financial problems. (Tr. 43)
Applicant  indicated  the  first  offense  was  more  than  20  years  ago.  (Tr.  50)  The
second offense did not result in a conviction, and she paid restitution for the third offense.
(Tr. 50) She is a different person today. (Tr. 48) She is a mother of four children and a
mentor to others. (Tr. 48) She wants to move on and have a successful career and life.
(Tr. 48)
