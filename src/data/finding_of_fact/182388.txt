Applicant,  63,  has  worked  as  a  program  manager  for  a  federal  contracting
company since 2019. He also serves as pastor to a church that he and his wife founded
in 2014. He served in the in the U.S. Air Force from 1976 until retiring in 1998 as a Master
Sergeant. He held a security clearance at various levels during his military service. The
record  does  not  contain  any  evidence  of  any  security  violations  or  other  incidents  of
concern related to Applicant’s past handling and safeguarding of  classified information.
He completed his most recent security clearance application in March 2019. He disclosed
that he had not filed his federal income tax returns for 2016 and 2017. The background
investigation developed additional derogatory information. The credit reports in the record
as well as Applicant’s responses to DOHA issued interrogatories serve as the basis for
the  Government’s  financial  concerns.  The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  failed  to  file  his
federal and state income tax returns from 2016 to 2018 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.b); that he owed
approximately $24,516 in federal taxes (SOR ¶¶ 1.c – 1.d); that he owed over $112,389
in  delinquent  student  loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.e  –  1.h);  and  that  he  owed  $7,884  on  two
delinquent accounts. (Tr. 21-24; GE 1)
Applicant admits the he failed to filed his income tax returns for the 2016 through
2018 tax years. Consequently, the IRS filed substitute returns for the 2016 and 2017 tax
years, resulting in the Agency assessing him over $24,516 in additional federal taxes. At
the hearing, he testified that he also failed to timely file his 2019 and 2020 federal income
tax returns. Applicant took responsibility for his failure to timely file his income tax returns,
claiming  oversights  on  his  part.  He  testified  that  a  flood  in  his  home  in  Spring  2021
prevented him from gathering the documentation he needed to file his 2018 through 2020
tax returns. (Tr. 24, 45-47; GE 3; AE F-G)
Applicant self-prepared his 2016 income tax returns, but used a tax preparer for
the 2017 and 2018 tax years. According to updated IRS transcripts (AE F – G), Applicant
filed the 2016 federal income tax return in March 2020, indicating he was owed a $10,137
refund that was applied to the outstanding $17,531 tax liability for the 2017 tax year. He
filed the 2017 tax return in April 2020, indicating that he was owed a $17,889 refund of
which the IRS transferred $11,244 to another, unspecified non-IRS debt. He also provided
a receipt from the state tax authority showing payment of $2,673 in taxes for  the 2016
and 2017 tax years. (Tr. 39-45, 58-60; AE A-C)
Applicant  provided  a  completed  copy  of  his 2018  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns,  signed by Applicant and  his wife  in February 2022. He overpaid  his  state and
federal income taxes and was due a refund. He provided photographs showing that he
mailed the returns to the state and federal tax authorities on February 22, 2022. At the
time the record closed, Applicant did not provide any evidence that he had filed his 2019
or 2020 income tax returns. (Tr. 46-47; AE C, I-M)
After separating from the Air Force, Applicant earned  a  bachelor’s and  master’s
degrees and completed some additional post-graduate work toward a doctoral degree.
He financed his education through student loans. He testified that between 2015, when
he stopped taking classes, and 2020, he did not make any payments toward his student
loans. He could not afford to make payments consistently as the obligation was nearly
$3,000  per  month.  Applicant  claimed  that  two  periods  of  unemployment  between
November 2017 and March 2018, and November 2018 to January 2019, also prevented
him from paying his student loans as he focused on paying his household bills. At time of
the hearing, the loans were in forbearance under the COVID -19 student loan payment
pause  announced  by  President  Biden  in  March  2020.  Applicant  contacted  his  loan
servicer to arrange his participation in a rehabilitation program set to begin in March 2022,
with a monthly payment of $1,400. Since then, President Biden has extended the student
loan payment moratorium through January 1, 2023. It is unknown if Applicant decided to
begin  participation  in  the  rehabilitation  program  as  scheduled,  or  to  keep  the  loans  in
forbearance status. (Tr. 26-27, 31-36, 60-62,65; AE E, N-R)
The   SOR  alleges  the   Applicant  also  owes   two   delinquent  consumer  accounts.
According   to   a   credit  report,  dated   January   2022,  Applicant  paid  the   $987   charged-off
account alleged  in SOR ¶  1.i. (AE  D)  Applicant claims that he  does not recall  incurring
the   debt   alleged   in  SOR  ¶   1.j  ($6,897)   owed   to   the   university   where  he   did  his  post-
graduate studies. That debt remains unresolved. (Tr. 27-30, 62-63; GE 4-6)
Applicant testified that he and  his wife have been working on rehabilitating their
finances since 2016 or 2017, engaging a credit repair organization to help them clean up
their credit histories. To date, the credit-repair company has helped Applicant to remove
44 negative items from his credit report. (Tr. 69-71; AE S)
Applicant  currently  earns  $120,000  per  year  and  enjoys  an  annual  household
income of over $270,000, including his wife’s salary and his military retirement income.
He also receives a housing stipend from his church (Tr. 24, 36-37)
