Applicant  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.d.  She  admitted  the
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.e through 1.q. Her admissions are adopted as findings of fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 32 years old. She is not married. She has a nine-year-old child. She
does  not  receive  child  support.  She  graduated  from  high  school  in  2008.  She  began
attending  college  full  time  in  2008.  She  worked  part-time  while  attending  college.  She
stopped attending in 2012, when she had her child. She went back to school in 2014 and
stopped  again  in  2015.  She  needs  two  more  semesters  to  earn  her  degree.  Applicant
began working for a federal contractor in June 2019, but stopped in February 2021. She
explained that due to the pandemic and her security clearance review she was not able
to work for this employer. Her annual salary at the time was approximately $35,000. She
has been working at temporary jobs. (Tr. 16-24, 58)
The  SOR alleges that Applicant has five  delinquent consumer debts (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-
1.d   and   1.n)
totaling
totaling   approximately   $2,331;  delinquent  student
approximately  $32,325  (SOR ¶¶  1.e  through  1.m);  unfiled  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns from tax year 2019 (SOR ¶¶  1.o-1.p) and  a $244 state tax debt  (SOR ¶ 1.q).
loans
Applicant provided documents to corroborate that the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($426)
was settled in September 2020; the debt in ¶ 1.b ($142) was paid in January 2020; and
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($564) was settled in August 2019. These debts are resolved. (Tr.
26; AE D, E, F)
Applicant testified that sometime before December 2021, she was working with a
person  who  was  helping  her  with  her finances,  but  she  lost faith  in  that  person.  So  in
December 2021, she began working with a credit specialist (CS) who gave her tips on
budgeting and tackling her financial problems. The service was free for the first 60 days
and then she paid CS $99 a month until about two months ago. CS sent out letters to the
credit  bureaus  to  dispute  some  of  her  debts.  Applicant  stated  she  has  not  received
responses regarding the disputed debts. (Tr. 30-32)
Applicant denied the medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($284). She stated she was unable
to determine the creditor and had contacted a number on the credit report, but there was
no  response.  She  stated  that  CS  is  disputing  that  debt,  but  she  has  not  received  a
response.  This  debt  is  reflected  as  a  collection  account  in  her  September  2019  credit
bureau report (CBR) with an assignment date of September 2016 and a last activity date
of September 2019. It is not reflected on her 2021 and 2022 CBRs. (Tr. 27-29; GE 2, 3,
4, 5)
Applicant is disputing the debt in SOR ¶ 1.n ($915). She admitted this debt in her
answer  to  the  SOR,  but  testified  that  she  never  had  an  account  with  this  cell  phone
provider, so she disputed it. In her background investigation, she told the investigator that
she  had  not  had  an  account  with  this  creditor  since  2017  and  was  unaware  of  the
collection  account.  She  intended  to  contact the  creditor  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the
debt and pay it if it was accurate. Her two 2019, 2021, and 2022 CBRs reflect this debt
as  a  charged-off  account.  She  testified  that  CS  is  disputing  this  debt.  Post-hearing,
Applicant provided a copy of a credit report showing the account had been disputed and
deleted. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 32-34; GE 2, 3, 4, 5; AE H)
Applicant testified that she funded her college education with student loans and
worked  part-time  while  attending  college.  In  2015,  she  stopped  attending  school  and
could not afford to pay her student loans. She did not contact the lender to advise them
of her status. (Tr. 19-22)
In January 2019,  Applicant was interviewed by the government investigator  and
was confronted with her delinquent student loans. After she stopped attending school in
2015, she did not make any payments on her student loans. She disagreed with the debts
because she had not received any correspondence that they were in collection. She said
she  had  three  student  loans  and  did  not  recall  the  name  of  the  lender  and  had  no
knowledge  the  loans  were  from  the  Department  of  Education  (DOE).  She  intended  to
obtain a copy of her credit report to determine who she needed to pay and then pay the
loans if the information was correct. The debts are reflected as collection accounts in her
2019 CBR and the loans were obtained from 2009 through 2012. She testified that it was
difficult to handle her student loans when she lost her job. (Tr. 35-40, 58-60; GE 3, 5)
Applicant  testified  that she  participated  in  a student  loan  rehabilitation  program,
where  she  was  to  pay  $5  a  month  for  a  period  of  months.  She  stated  she  made  the
payments until the government placed the student loans in a deferred status. The record
was held open to allow Applicant an opportunity to provide the supporting documents to
show when she had applied for the rehabilitation program and that she was making the
required monthly payments before the deferment. Post-hearing, she provided a copy of
her request to the creditor from March 2021 to rehabilitate her student loans, copies of
her monthly rehabilitation payments from March 2021 to August 2021, and a November
2021, confirmation letter from the creditor advising her she had successfully rehabilitated
the  loans.  The  loans  are  now  deferred  pursuant  to  the  Government’s  moratorium  on
student loan payments. (Tr. 35-40; AE I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P)
SOR ¶¶ 1.o, 1.p, and 1.q alleged that Applicant failed to timely file her 2019 federal
and state income tax returns and she owed past-due state income taxes ($244) for tax
year 2017. Applicant testified that she did not timely file her 2019 federal and state income
tax  returns  because  she  had  recently  moved  at  the  time  and  decided  to  have  a
professional complete her tax returns. She did not receive a W-2 income statement from
one of her employers, which caused a problem of unreported income. She stated that she
filed her 2019 returns when she completed her 2020 returns. She received a refund for
2020 tax year. She provided unsigned copies of  her 2019 federal and state tax returns
indicating they were completed by a professional tax preparer. Her 2019 federal income
tax return showed that she owed $722 in federal income taxes and $104 for state income
tax. There was also an electronically completed voucher for the amount to be paid to the
IRS that was included with the return. (GE 2; Tr. 40-56; AE A, B)
Applicant provided a letter from the Department of the Treasury from April 2021,
that showed a portion of her refund was applied to a state tax obligation. Presumably, this
refund  was  from  her  2020  federal  taxes  and  satisfied  her  2017  state  tax  debt.  Post-
hearing,  Applicant  stated  in  her  email  that  she  verified  with  the  IRS  that  her  2019  tax
return was not filed. She contacted her tax preparer who told her that her 2019 tax returns
were mailed. Applicant said she advised the tax preparer that the IRS tax transcripts for
2019, reflected the returns were not filed. The tax preparer told her that she would mail
Applicant a copy of the 2019 tax returns to sign and mail. Applicant stated that she had
reached out several times to the tax preparer, but was unable to connect with her. At the
close of the record, she had not yet received the tax returns that were presumably in the
mail. (Tr. 40-56)
At her hearing, Applicant provided a copy of her 2019 federal and state tax returns
as exhibits. The tax preparer’s name and identification number were on the copies. The
copies  were  unsigned  by  Applicant.  Also  included  with  the  tax  exhibits  were  copies  of
electronically prepared  payment  vouchers  with  Applicant’s  name  and  address  and  the
address of the IRS and state tax authority where they should be mailed. It is unknown
why Applicant has not signed her copy of the tax documents and mailed them. Applicant
provided a copy of a letter from the IRS indicating that on July 26, 2022, it had received
a request for verification of non-filing for tax year 2019. The letter confirmed that there
was no record that Applicant’s 2019 federal tax return had been filed. The evidence does
not support that her 2019 federal and state tax have been filed. (Tr. 40-56; GE 2; AE A,
B, C, G, L, Q)
Applicant  attributes   her  financial  issues  to   being   underemployed.   She   stopped
attending  college  when  she  had  her daughter. She  moved  in  with  her parents.  She  was
working  at a  state  office  for  about  seven  years and  was only  earning  about $8  an  hour.
She  is working  at a  temporary  job  now  and  earning  $15  an  hour. She  has  no  extra  money
at the end of  the  month after paying her expenses. She  does not have a budget.  (Tr. 61-
65
Applicant’s  August  2021  and  June  2022  CBRs  reflect  that  she  has  a  new
delinquent debt for unpaid insurance for $52 that was not alleged in the SOR. It was first
reported delinquent in July 2021. There is a second delinquent debt reported in the June
2022 CRB that is reflected as a charged-off account for $2,759 that was opened in June
2020, and the last payment made was June 2021. I will not consider this information for
disqualifying purposes,  but  may consider it  when  applying the  mitigating conditions,  in
making a credibility determination, and in my whole person analysis. (GE 4, 5)
CS  testified  on  Applicant’s  behalf.  In  her  technical  role,  CS  does  not  provide
budgeting and financial management services, but did try to assist Applicant with some
financial advice. CS disputed items on Applicant’s credit report that did not belong to her
or had an inaccurate amount reported. She advised Applicant how credit cards worked.
(Tr. 70-78)
