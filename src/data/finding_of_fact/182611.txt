Applicant admitted both of the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b with explanations.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 61 years old. He served in the armed forces from 1983 to 1995 and
received  an  honorable  discharge.  He  married  in  1988  and  has  two  adult  children.  He
earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1983  and  a  master’s  degree  in  2001.  He  has  been
employed by a federal contractor since December 2019.
Applicant disclosed in his October 2019 security clearance application (SCA) that
he was unemployed from January 2014 until September 2019. He also disclosed that he
had not filed federal or state income tax returns for tax years  2015 through 2018, and
explained  that  he  had  no  income  during  those  years  due  to  his  unemployment,  and
therefore was not required to file. During his December 2019 background investigation
with a government investigator, he stated that he checked the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) and his state’s  Department of Taxation  (DOT) websites for the subject tax years
and confirmed his income fell below the required filing threshold. (Items 4, 5)
In December 2019 Applicant received a notice from his state’s DOT that he owed
$6,316 for tax year 2016. Applicant told the investigator that he intended to dispute the
amount owed, but he would pay the balance if it was determined to be correct. In January
2020,  Applicant  paid  the  DOT  $6,350.  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  he  stated  that  he
resolved  his  state  tax  issue  and  will  continue  to  work  with  the  DOT  to  resolve  any
outstanding issues. He said he had not received any income in his state for the other tax
years  alleged.  To  address  the  possibility  that  he  owed  federal  taxes,  he  submitted  a
payment to the IRS for $2,500 in mid-December 2019. In his Answer to the SOR, he said
he sent the IRS another $1,200 to cover any estimated penalties. (Items 3, 5, 6)
Applicant  answered  Government
in  January  2021.  The
Interrogatories specifically requested that Applicant provide copies of his 2015 to 2018
IRS tax transcripts so it could verify the status of his filings and verify if he did not need
to file for those years. He stated that he had not received the documents in time, so did
not provide them with his Answer. (Item 6)
interrogatories
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he has inquired of the IRS about
the status of any balance he owed or refund he was due for tax years 2015 through 2018.
At that time, he said he had not yet received a response. He said he intended to continue
to work with the IRS and DOT to resolve any tax matters. He did not provide copies of the
IRS tax transcripts for tax years 2015 through 2018 that he had said he was waiting for
when he completed the interrogatories in January 2021. (Item 3)
Applicant told the government investigator that his wife worked during the tax years
in question, but did not earn enough income to require filing. While unemployed, he lived
off of his savings and investments. He said he ensured he had the required tax withheld
from his distributions. In his SOR answer, he said that he always prepaid any taxes owed
when he redeemed his investments. (Items 3, 5)
Distributions  of  investments  are  included  in  a  taxpayer’s  gross  income  from  all
sources, which are the basis for federal and state income tax return filing requirements.
Applicant did not provide a copy of his tax transcripts for any of the tax years in question
that might show he was not required to file for each of the tax years. (Item 3, 5)
