In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  (¶¶  1.a  –  1.i).  He
also  provided  an  explanation  for  each  of  the  allegations.  Applicant’s  admissions  are
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  62  years  old.  He  has  been  employed  as  a  logistics  management
specialist  by  a  defense  contractor  since  2017.  He  was  granted  a  secret  clearance  in
about 2004. He served in the Army on active duty from 1979-1992, and in the reserve
from  2001-2007.  He  was  married  in  1984  and  divorced  in  2007.  He  was  remarried  in
2009 and divorced in 2018. He has two adult children. (Item 3)
Applicant’s  SCA  shows  that  he  has  been  consistently  employed  since  2008.  In
his  Answer,  he  cited  a  number  of  factors  that  have  impacted  his  finances,  including:
low-paying  work;  his  ex-wife’s  refusal  to  get  conventional  unemployment;  failure  of  a
part-time  startup  business;  and  reduced  earnings  when  he  left  the  military  in  1992.
Some of these issues caused him to file Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in 1995 and 2000. (Item
2, 3)
Applicant  stated  that his wife  obtained  information online that American  citizens
should not pay taxes. He claims that he disagreed with her, but she refused to file. He
stated that he  had always paid his taxes on time without any issues.  He asserted that
after they got divorced, he went to a tax preparation service, and found out that he could
have filed  his tax returns  “single”  during the years his wife refused to file. He reported
that  he  has  agreements  to  pay  his  outstanding  Federal  and  state  taxes,  and  that  he
makes  automatic  payments  monthly.  However,  he  did  not  provide  sufficient
documentation of these agreements or payments. (Item 2, 3)
Applicant’s IRS tax account records show that his 2014, 2015, and 2016 Federal
income  tax  returns  were  not  filed  until  2018.  His  2017  return  was  filed  on  time.  As  of
September 2020,  he  owed  the  IRS: $14,876 for 2014; $13,046 for 2015;  and $14,147
for  2016.  His  records  show  that  he  made  some  payments  on  his  2015  taxes  from
February 2020 to September 2020. The records also showed that he had an installment
agreement  for  his  2017  taxes  and  made  $110  payments  from  December  2018  to
February 2020. (Item 8)
The  record  includes  a  one-page  document  from  an  unknown  website,  on  an
unknown  date,  showing  that  Applicant  was  choosing  a  payment  amount  of  $690
monthly,  but  no  payment  agreement  was  provided.  Another  document  titled  payment
activity,  shows  seven  $690  payments  towards  his  2015  taxes,  and  nine  payments  for
his 2017 taxes. No recent payments were documented. (Item 8)
An  account  summary  from  a  state  Department  of  Revenue  shows  a  $11,634
balance.  Applicant  wrote  on  this  page  that  he  pays  $283.64  monthly,  but  provided  no
other documentation. The record also shows state tax liens filed in 2018 for $2,304 and
$804. The first lien was satisfied in September 2019. (Item 8, 9)
The U.S. Army Central Personnel Security Clearance Facility warned Applicant in
2002 that the retention of his security clearance was contingent on him avoiding future
financial  delinquencies.  His  2011  SCA  and  credit  report  shows  at  that  time  he  owed
approximately $18,000 in child support, had a $738 tax lien, and defaulted on a $4,400
auto loan. (Item 4, 7, 14)
The  SOR  alleges  three  charged-off  debts  totaling  $34,567;  two  Chapter  13
Bankruptcies filed five years apart; failure to timely file three years of Federal and state
income
tax  debt;  and
approximately $11,000 in unpaid state tax debt. The status of the debts follows:

SOR  ¶  1.a  is  credit-card  account  that  was  charged-off  in  2016  for  $8,642.
Applicant stated that he became unemployed and unable to pay the account. He claims
that  he  contacted  the  creditor  to  negotiate  a  payment  plan,  but  provided  no
documentation of those efforts. He stated that he forgot about the debt once he stopped
receiving notices in the mail. (Item 2, 5, 6, 13)
SOR ¶ 1.b is a credit-card account that was charged-off in 2016 for $7,032. In his
Answer, Applicant stated that this debt was for a loan for his wife to start an online travel
business, which failed. In his background interview, he stated that this was a credit card
that he was unable to pay when he lost his job. He claims that he contacted the creditor
to negotiate a payment plan, but provided no documentation of those efforts. He admits
that he ignored notices in the mail about this debt, since he cannot pay it. (Item 2, 5, 6,
13)
SOR  ¶  1.c  is  an  auto  loan  that  was  charged-off  in  2017  for  $18,893.  Applicant
stated that he purchased a van to start a part-time delivery service after getting laid off
from his job. The delivery service was not successful, and he defaulted on the loan after
six months. He stated that he returned the vehicle to the dealership, and  was charged
for the full cost of the vehicle. (Item 2, 5, 6, 13)
SOR  ¶  1.d  is  a  Chapter  13  Bankruptcy  filed  by  Applicant  in  1995,  which  was
discharged in July 2000. He stated that after leaving active duty with the Army, his pay
dramatically changed, and he could no longer afford his expenses. (Item 2)
SOR  ¶  1.e  is  a  Chapter  13  Bankruptcy  filed  by  Applicant  in  December  2000,
which  was  discharged  in  April 2006. He  stated his job situation had  not  changed  after
leaving active duty, and he was still working a low-paying job. He reported that his wife
was not working, and he did not want to let his debts go into default. (Item 2)

His  tax  records  show  some  payments  up  to  September  2020.  However,  he  has  not

record  of  payments,  or

Applicant  did  not  submit  any  documentation  concerning  his  current  financial
situation, such as his monthly income and expenses, his assets, or whether he follows a
budget. In 2020, he reported that he has about $3,000 of discretionary funds at the end
of each month. No evidence was provided that Applicant has received credit counseling.
