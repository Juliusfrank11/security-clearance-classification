Personal Conduct
Applicant’s two allegations under this concern are established by his September
28, 2021 SF-86; his Office of Personnel Management (OPM) background investigation
conducted  from  December  2,  2019,  to  December  20,  2019,  containing  his  December
13,  2019  OPM  Personal  Subject  Interview  (PSI);  and  his  February  1,  2021  SOR
Answer. (Items 1 – 3)
The  following  is  a  summary  of  the  two  allegations  against  Applicant  under  the
personal conduct concern and his response to those allegations.
SOR ¶  2.a  –  Alleged  that Applicant falsified  material facts  on  his  September  28,
2019 SF-86 when queried whether in the last seven years he had ever been  fired  from a
job;   quit  after  being   told  he   would  be   fired;   left  a   job   by   mutual  agreement  following
charges  or  allegations   of  misconduct;   left   a   job   by   mutual  agreement  after   notice   of
unsatisfactory  performance;  received  a  written  warning; or  been  officially  reprimanded,
suspended,  or  disciplined   for  misconduct  in   the   workplace,  such   as  a   violation   of
security   policy,  to   which  he   answered,   “No.”  Applicant  admitted   this  allegation.  He
explained   that,   “I   erred   in   answering   this  question   and   I   now   acknowledge   that   I  was
terminated  from  [Government contractor employer] for coming  to  work intoxicated.  I had
been  up  late  the  night before  celebrating  my  71st  birthday  and  should not have  gone  to
work at 6  am,  my  usual start  of my  shift.  I  found  it  hard  to  believe  at  the  time  that I could
have  had  a  measurable  quantity  in my  system.  I now  acknowledge  that   I was wrong  in
answering  ‘No’  (to) this question.” (Item 1)
SOR ¶  2.b  –  Alleged  that Applicant falsified  material facts  on  his   September  28,
2019   SF-86   when   queried   whether  in   the   last  seven   years  his   use   of  alcohol   had   a
negative  impact on  his  work performance, his professional or personal relationships,  his
finances,  or  resulted   in  intervention   by   law  enforcement/public  safety   personnel,  to
which  he   answered   “No.”  Applicant  admitted   this  allegation.  He  explained,  “Same   as
1.a. above.”
Although  not  alleged,  it  is  noteworthy  that  in  addition  to  the  two  Guideline  E
allegations  discussed,  infra,  Applicant  also  told  two  different  versions  about  his
termination  from  his  Government  contractor  employer  in  July  2019.  While  he  told  the
OPM investigator that he  showed  up for  work with  alcohol in  his system from drinking
the  night  before,  he  told  his  doctor  that  he  had  been  terminated  from  his  job  after
returning from lunch with alcohol on his breath. (Item 6)
