Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e, 1.g, and 1.j. Her
admissions  have  been  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  She  denied  the  SOR
allegations  in  ¶¶  1.f,  1.h,  1.i,  1.k  and  2.a.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 56 years old. She married in 1993 and divorced in 2016. She has four
sons, ages 29, 27, 26 and 23. She is a college graduate who took time off to raise her
children. In 2012, she went back to work full time when her third child started high school.
She worked for the same employer until 2017, when she was laid off due to budget cuts.
She was unemployed for about six months and then worked for about five months before
leaving her job to care for her sick mother. She began her present employment  with a
federal contractor in November 2018. (Tr. 16-25; GE 1)
The   debts   in  the  SOR   are  corroborated  by   Applicant’s  admission,   credit  reports
provided as Government Exhibits, and  her testimony. (GE 1-7)
In about 2015 one of Applicant’s sons was working for a franchise business that
he thought had great potential. He was being mentored by the owner. Applicant and her
son discussed the possibility of purchasing their own franchise. Her son thought it was a
promising opportunity to purchase a franchise and open it in a neighboring city. Applicant
testified that she did her due diligence by working with local businesses, attending training
and participating in working groups and discussions with coaches offered by the franchise
business. (Tr. 25-31)
In  October 2015,  Applicant  decided  to  purchase   the  franchise and  was the  sole
owner.  It   cost  $60,000.  She   was  working   full   time   ($70,000   annual  income   in   2015;
$95,000  in 2022) and  had  received  a  lump-sum  payment of  $90,000  from  her divorce.
From  the  Small  Business Association  (SBA),  she  obtained a  loan  ($150,000) to  start the
business  (SOR ¶  1.a-$133,749). She  purchased  two  vehicles for the  business (SOR ¶¶
1.c and 1.d). She  used  credit cards  to finance  some  of the  business expenses. She  said
she   was  nervous  and   excited.  Her  two   oldest  sons  were  full-time   employees  of   the
business   and   her  two   younger  sons,  who   were  still   in  college   and   high   school,
occasionally  worked for the business.  (Tr. 31-33, 66-77)
The business opened in early 2016 and did very well initially. In 2018, the business
started to fail due to various factors; for instance, she found it was difficult to get good
employees, and she believed some employees were stealing from the business. In 2018,
she and her sons were working just to pay the franchise fee. She was unable to repay
her SBA  loan  and  contacted  them  about her options.  Applicant  testified  that  when  the
company went out of business in 2018, she spoke a few times with the SBA and with the
collection agency handling the SBA loan. No arrangements to pay the debt were made.
In June 2022, she spoke with the SBA about the defaulted loan and was advised to submit
a form showing her assets and liabilities. She has not yet submitted the form. (Tr. 32-38,
66-77, 89-91)
Applicant  testified  that  after  the  business  failed, she  was working  with  a  lawyer and
discussed   filing   bankruptcy.  She   said   she   was  working   with   the   attorney   for  at   least   a
year. She  changed  attorneys and  discussed  filing  bankruptcy  with  her current attorney
over the  course  of approximately  two  years. At the  time  her business failed,  she  and  her
ex-husband  were still  joint owners of  a  house  they  were attempting  to  sell, but were having
difficulty. Due  to  the  equity  in the  house  it  was difficult to  file  bankruptcy. She  estimated
her Chapter 13  bankruptcy  payments would be around $3,500  a  month, which she could
not afford. She  did  not  have  any  liquid assets. She  said  the  house  sold on  July  7, 2022.
She   said  that   she   was  entitled   to   $275,000  from   the  proceeds of   the   sale,  but her ex-
husband  had  done  significant  repairs in  order  to  sell  it,  and  she  had to  reimburse him for
the  costs.  She  did  not know  exactly  the  amount owed, but  anticipated  it  could  be  $40,000
to $50,000. She anticipated receiving her share of  the profit shortly. (Tr. 35-40)
The  debt in  SOR ¶ 1.b  ($18,732) was a  credit card that  was used  in Applicant’s
business.  She   contacted   the   creditor  in   2018.  She   did   not   follow   up   and   contact  them
again until a week before her hearing, with a letter stating she believed there were some
fraudulent  charges made  to  the  account.  She  requested  an  itemized  bill. The  debt  is not
resolved. (Tr. 40-43, 77-78; AE F)
The  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.d  ($9,474  and  $9,025,  respectively)  are  two
accounts from the same creditor for vehicles Applicant purchased and were used in her
business  and  later  repossessed.  A  week  before  her  hearing,  she  sent  a  letter  to  the
creditor indicating she wanted to discuss making an arrangement for payment. The debt
in SOR ¶ 1.j ($250) is also with the same creditor. Applicant testified that this account
was bundled with the other two accounts, but did not offer any documents to substantiate
the information. None of these debts are resolved. (Tr. 43-46, 53-54, 78; AE G)
The  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  ($6,328)  is  a  credit  card  debt  that  Applicant  has  been
making $150 payments on since November 2020. If she continues to make her payments
the debt will be resolved in June 2024. The debt is being resolved. (Tr. 48-49, 78; AE H)
Applicant testified and documented that she paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f ($4,605)
and 1.g ($2,869) through payments she started in 2019. These debts are resolved. (Tr.
49-51; AE I, J)
Applicant settled the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h ($2,668) for $1,867 in June 25, 2021. This
debt is resolved. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.i ($1,789) was settled in December 2020 for $679.
This debt is resolved. (Tr. 51-53; AE K, M)
The creditor for the charged-off debt in SOR ¶ 1.k ($4,511) had a judgment entered
in December 2020 against Applicant. She stated that she made payments, but could not
sell her house until she paid the balance owed on this debt. She paid the debt on June
27, 2022. The debt is resolved. (Tr. 54-57; AE N)
Applicant testified that she hopes to resolve her remaining delinquent debts with
the money she receives after the proceeds from the sale of the house she owned with
her ex-husband when the money becomes available. She said she has a budget and lives
within  her  means.  She  has  about  $10,000  in  savings  and  $150,000  in  a  retirement
account. (Tr. 57, 79-83)
Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in February 2020. In
response  to  questions  about  whether  Applicant  had  any  delinquencies  involving
enforcement, she stated “Yes” and listed “SBA” as the agency to which she owed a debt.
She indicated she was currently delinquent on a loan. She provided the loan number and
the  amount she  owed ($133,000). She  wrote  “I bought a franchise  and  took out a  loan
with  SBA.  The  business  failed.  I  am  currently  working  with  my  attorney  discussing
bankruptcy.”  (GE  1)  She  further  stated:  “Currently  working  with  my  attorney  regarding
options.” She also said: “Court not involved.” (Tr. 57; GE 1)
Section 26 also asks about delinquencies involving routine accounts. It specifically
asks  if  the  applicant  in  the  last  seven  years  had  any  property  repossessed,  either
voluntarily or involuntarily; defaulted on any type of loan; had bills or debts turned over to
a collection agency; had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or canceled
for failing to pay as agreed; if the applicant had been over 120 days delinquent on any
debt not previously entered, or if applicant was currently over 120 days delinquent on any
debt. She answered “No.” (GE 1)
Applicant  testified  that  she  did  not  intentionally  lie  or  attempt  to  deceive  the
Government. She said she disclosed the SBA delinquent loan and did not know why she
did not disclose any of her other debts. She said she thought the question was beyond
seven years and not within seven years, but then said she could not swear to that being
the reason. She said she thought the debts were not over 120 days delinquent or she
was not contacted by collection agencies. She said her debts had not been turned over
to collection agencies at the time she completed her SCA and there were not court actions
against her. She was aware that two vehicles she purchased had been repossessed and
that she was unable to pay the numerous bills associated with the business. I did not find
Applicant’s explanations  credible. I find that although she disclosed her defaulted SBA
loan, she intentionally failed to disclose her numerous other delinquent debts. (Tr. 57-66,
85-86)
Applicant  provided  copies  of  her  2019  through  2021  employee  performance
appraisals reflecting her outstanding or above average performance. A character witness,
who has known her since 2014 and considers her a close friend, testified on her behalf.
He was aware that Applicant was purchasing a franchise and thought it was a high-risk
business.  He  considers  himself  fiscally  conservative.  He  has  never  questioned
Applicant’s  integrity  and  believes  she  is  an  upstanding  dedicated  mother  and  family
member, and he does not have any concerns about her holding a security clearance. He
held one for 40 years. (Tr. 101-107)
Applicant’s boyfriend  testified  on  her behalf.  They  have  been  together for about
five years, and he has known her for about seven years. He testified that she is a hard
worker and was stressed out about the business she purchased. He was aware of her
debts and believes she has every intention of paying them. He believes she is honest and
would not be in a relationship with her if she was not. He believes her failure to disclose
her debts was an accident and sometimes the questions on the SCA are difficult to follow.
(Tr. 93-101)
