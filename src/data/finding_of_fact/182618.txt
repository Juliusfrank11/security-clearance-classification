Applicant is 63 years old. He was born in a foreign country and immigrated to the
United States as a political refugee in 1981 at the age of 22. He became a U.S. citizen in
June 1989. He married in 2002 and divorced in March 2016. He and his former wife have
two children, ages 18 and 15. He graduated from high school in 1979 in the country of his
birth. He has taken college classes in the United States and earned a certificate. In 2015
he applied for a security clearance, which was granted in May 2016 (or possibly in 2018,
Tr. at 42), so that he could  work for a  U.S. Government  contractor as  a linguist  in the
country of his birth. He is seeking to retain his clearance in relation to his employment as
a linguist with a different Government contractor. He has worked for that contractor since
November 2019. (Tr. at 10-16, 40-46; AE I at 1, 2.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is
financially  overextended  with  delinquent  debts  and  therefore  potentially  unreliable,
untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
The  SOR identifies  eight charged-off  debts  or debts in collection  owed  by  Applicant
totaling  about $36,000.  In  his  Answer, Applicant admitted all  of  the  SOR allegations  with
additional  explanations  regarding   his  understanding   of   the   status   of   the   debts.  The
existence  and  amounts of  these  debts is also supported  by  credit reports in the  record
dated  July  6, 2020,  November 3, 2020, May  26, 2021, and  April 27, 2022. (GE  3  to  5  and
7.)
The background and current status of each of the debts alleged in the SOR is as
follows:
1.a. Credit-card debt charged off in the amount of $10,202. Applicant opened this
credit-card  account  in 2012  and  defaulted  on  the  account  in  January 2016.  The  credit
card was used for business and personal expenses. Applicant has made no subsequent
payments on this account. He believes that the statute of limitations has expired on this
debt. He testified that he contacted the creditor when he became employed by his current
employer in 2019, but he was unable to pay the amount demanded by the creditor. He
did not contact the creditor earlier when he first began working in as a linguist in June
2018. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 48-54; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 7 at 3;
AE A at 10-11.)
1.b. Credit-card debt charged off in the amount of $1,859. Applicant opened this
credit-card account in 2013 and defaulted on the account in March 2016. The account
was charged off. Applicant has made no payments on this account to resolve this debt.
This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 52; GE 3 at 3-4; GE 4 at 4; GE 5 at 3; GE 7 at 4.)
1.c. Credit-card debt charged off in the amount of $2,448. Applicant opened this
credit card account in 2012 and defaulted on the account in February 2016. The account
was charged off. Applicant has made no subsequent payments on this account. This debt
is not resolved. (Tr. at 52; GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 4; GE 5 at 3.)
1.d. Credit-card debt charged off in the amount of $4,998. Applicant defaulted on
this  account,  and  the  creditor  placed  it  for  collection.  Applicant  has  made  no  further
payments on this account. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 55-58; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 2.)
1.e. Credit-card debt charged off in the amount of $3,790. Applicant defaulted on
this account, and the creditor placed it for collection. Applicant has made no payments to
resolve this account. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 57-58; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 2-3.)
1.f.  Retail  store  credit-card  debt  charged  off  in  the  amount  of  $654.  Applicant
opened this credit card account in 2011 and defaulted on the account in February 2016.
The  account  was  charged  off.  Applicant  claimed  that  this  debt  was  paid  off  through  a
payment to a collection agency. The names of the original creditors and the amounts of
the debt do not match to support his claim. See discussion in the Mitigation section below.
Although  Applicant  believes  he  paid  the  collection  agency  for  this  debt,  he  has  not
documented that payment. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 58-66; GE 3 at 5; GE 4 at 5;
GE 5 at 4.)
1.g  Loan  account  charged  off  in  the  amount  of  $6,342.  Applicant  opened  this
account  in  2012  for  his  business  in  the  original  amount  of  $21,000  and  after  repaying
much  of  the  loan,  he  defaulted  on  the  account  in  February  2015.  The  account  was
charged  off,  and  the  creditor placed  it for collection.  Applicant  claims  that  he  paid  this
account, but did not provide any documentation that he did so. The debt appears on his
May 2021 credit report in the record (GE 3) as unpaid and sold/transferred to a third party.
This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 66; GE 3 at 5; GE 4 at 5; GE 5 at 4.)
1.h Collection  account  on  a  credit-card  debt  charged  off  in  the  amount of $5,973.
Applicant defaulted  on  this account,  and  the  creditor placed  it  for  collection.  In  his Answer
Applicant wrote  that  he  entered  into  a  payment  plan  with  the  collection  agency  in 2019.
In  support of  that statement,  he  provided  to  a  Government  investigator a  letter from  the
collection  agency, dated  July  31, 2020,  confirming  Applicant’s payment arrangement to
pay  this debt with  a  balance  of $5,973.16. Under the terms of  his plan, he  was obligated
to   pay   $5.00   per  month   for  12   months  beginning   August  30,   2020.   He  provided   no
documentation  evidencing  his payments.  The  terms of the  plan  make  no  mention  of any
future payments beyond the $60 paid over the  first year. Applicant claimed that he made
additional payments totaling  about  $2,800, but he  provided  no  documentation  to  support
that  claim  and  no  evidence  from  the  creditor that  the  debt had  been  resolved. In  light  of
the  available record  evidence, this debt is  not  resolved.  (Tr. at 74-75;  GE  4 at 3; GE 5  at
2; AE K  at 2-3.)
Mitigation
In 2001, Applicant started his own retail business and subsequently expanded the
business  into  wholesale  and  import/export.  His  business  faced  new  regulations  and
taxation in 2014 and his business ultimately failed in 2015 or 2016, causing the numerous
defaults on  the credit cards  and a  loan discussed above.  His  marriage  also failed that
year and he filed for divorce. His children were eight and 11 years old at that time, and
their mother declined  to  have  custody of  the children,  leaving them  with  Applicant.  He
was 56 years old at that time, and he felt he had limited job opportunities. He experienced
a period of underemployment or unemployment before beginning work in July 2018 as a
linguist. (Tr. at 12-16.)
Applicant  discussed  his  credit  problems  with  a  non-profit  organization.  He  was
counseled  to  consolidate  all  of  his  debts  and  pay  a  monthly  payment  or  to  file  for
bankruptcy. He had insufficient income to pay a consolidation loan, and he did not want
to  file  for  bankruptcy.  He  explained  his  situation  with  his  creditors  and  none  of  them
pursued  legal  actions.  Two  creditors  transferred  their  debts  to  collection  agencies.
Applicant has worked with the collection agencies, as discussed above and below. (Tr. at
14-15, 16, 73-74.)
Applicant was hired  as a  linguist by  a  U.S. Government contractor in late  2014. He
disclosed his financial problems in  his first security clearance application in  2015. In July
2018   he   was  deployed   to   a   war  zone.  His  ex-wife   took  custody   of   their   children   and
Applicant  paid   her  child  support.  He  worked   for  that  employer  until   October  2019.  In
November 2019  he  began  working  for a  new  employer as a  linguist supporting  a  different
U.S. agency. (Tr. at 15-16.)
In his 2015 e-QIP Applicant disclosed that he  had $13,000 of delinquent credit-
card debt and a $7,000 delinquent loan with the creditor identified in 1.g, above. He wrote
that  the  cause  of  the  delinquencies  was  a  “bad  economy.”  In  his  2019  e-E-QIP  he
provided some additional information about his delinquent debts. In another exhibit and
at the hearing, Applicant argued that he was granted a clearance in 2016 or 2018 after
fully  disclosing  his  history  of  delinquent  debts  in  his  2015  e-QIP  and  during  his
background interviews. (Tr. at 15, 42; GE 1 at 39-43; AE D at 109-110; AE I at 2.)
Applicant submitted two reference letters. One is from Applicant’s supervisor who
strongly supports Applicant in his effort to  establish mitigation of  the  security concerns
raised by his financial delinquencies. He describes Applicant as “thorough, conscientious,
and  kind”  The  reference  provider’s  command  handles  sensitive  matters  in  a  U.S.
embassy  in  a  foreign  country.  He  values  Applicant’s  discretion  and  dedication.  The
second reference is from a U.S. military officer who has worked with Applicant for several
months. He praised Applicant’s skills as a linguist.
Applicant also provided a Certificate of Appreciation he received in 2020 from the
military  command  he  supported  as  a  linguist.  The  Certificate  refers  to  Applicant’s
performance as a linguist as “exceptional.”
At the time of Applicant’s background interview in 2020, he provided a document,
dated July 30, 2020, evidencing a payment plan with a creditor that is not listed in the
SOR. The amount of the delinquent debt is stated to be $813, and the agreement provides
for a single payment of $244. This debt is only listed in the Government’s credit reports
dated July 6, 2020 and November 3, 2020 (GE 5 and GE 4, respectively), which reflect a
default, charge off, and referral to collection. The account was last active in 2016. It is not
clear why this debt was not listed in the SOR. Applicant sought to explain that this debt
was alleged in 1.f of the SOR. The names of the original creditor listed in the SOR and
the payment plan document do not match and therefore, do not support that argument.
The record evidence is incomplete regarding the history of this delinquency and payment
plan. (Tr. at 60-64; GE 4 at 5; GE 5 at 3.)
