Applicant  is a  42-year-old employee  of a  defense  contractor.  He has worked  for
defense  contractors since  1999,  and  for  his current employer since  2006. He seeks  to
retain  a   security   clearance,  which  he   has  held  for  more  than   20   years.  He  is  a   high
school graduate,  and he earned  technical certifications.  He married  in 2012. He and  his
wife  have  a  child,  and  he  has a  child  from  a  previous relationship.  (Tr.  at  13,  20-22, 28-

The   SOR  alleges  six   delinquent  debts   totaling   about  $133,661.  The   debts  are
established through credit reports and  Applicant’s admissions.
A number of factors contributed to Applicant’s financial problems. He had a costly
nine-year  custody  battle  with  the  mother  of  his  oldest  child.  His  wife  has  significant
medical and mental health issues that have prevented her from working.  Her condition
required  the  purchase  of  items  totaling  about  $2,000  per  month.  The  items  were  not
reimbursable by medical insurance. Both of his children required counseling to deal with
sexual  and  emotional abuse,  which  was  not  inflicted  by Applicant  or  his  wife.  He  also
assisted with the expenses related to his brother-in-law’s unexpected  passing  in 2018.

Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case  in  June 2021. Under Schedule  D,
Creditors  Who  Have  Claims  Secured  by  Property,  the  petition  listed  a  $143,065
mortgage  loan  (the  house  was  valued  at  $190,327).  Under  Schedule  E/F,  Creditors
Who  Have  Unsecured  Claims,  there  were  no  priority  unsecured  claims.  Nonpriority
unsecured  claims  totaled  $133,711.  The  six  SOR  debts  are  listed  in  the  bankruptcy
petition. (Tr. at 52-53; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5; AE E)
The  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  plan  has  not  yet  been  approved,  but  Applicant  has
been making monthly payments in anticipation  of its approval. He made ten payments
of  $1,750  between  July  2021  and  March  2022,  and  five  payments  of  $1,757  between
April 2022 and August 2022, for a total amount paid during that period of $26,285. He
pays his mortgage loan outside the plan. He intends to continue making payments into
the Chapter 13 bankruptcy unless the court approves a plan that is much greater than
he is currently paying and completely unaffordable. (Tr. at 25, 39-45, 54, 57-59; GE 5;
AE F, P-R)
Applicant’s  current  finances  are  better.  He  lives  a  frugal  lifestyle.  His  wife  is  in
counseling to deal with her issues. The collateral expenses related to her condition have
greatly  declined.  He  received  financial  counseling  as  a  requirement  of  his bankruptcy.
(Tr. at 24-25, 36-45, 49, 55, 59-60; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5; AE J, K)
Applicant  submitted  letters  attesting  to  his  exceptional  job  performance  and
strong moral character. He is praised for his trustworthiness, reliability, professionalism,
work ethic, honesty, honor, patriotism, frugality, and integrity. He is recommended for a
security clearance. (AE A-C)
