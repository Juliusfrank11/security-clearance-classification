SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant owes the federal government for delinquent taxes in
the amount of $18,224 for tax year (TY) 2016.
The following table reflects Applicant’s federal income tax information. (AE 1) For
TYs 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2020 he provided IRS tax transcripts, and for TY
2018 he provided a tax return. (AE 1; AE 2; AE 5) He filed his TY 2017 federal income
tax return about one year late because he was unable to file electronically or online, and
he needed to file a paper copy of his tax return. (Tr. 40) He knew he would not owe taxes
for TY 2017, and he did  not believe  it  was  important  to timely file his TY 2017 federal
income tax return. (Tr. 40) Some of his other tax returns were filed late because he was
unable to file electronically. (Tr. 70) At some point, the IRS advised him that there is no
penalty for filing a tax return late if no tax is due. (Tr. 80) He did not provide any evidence
that the IRS authorized him or taxpayers in general to file tax returns after their due dates
if they believed no taxes were due.
Amounts in the following table are rounded to the nearest thousand. The source
for the TY 2018 row is Applicant’s tax return. (AE 2) The sources for the other rows are
his  IRS tax transcripts.  (AE 1; AE 2) He requested an extension for filing his TY 2021
federal income tax return. (Tr. 43)

Applicant said he filed his TY 2018 tax return in October 2019. (AE 2) He provided
an October 15, 2019, Turbo Tax email, which notified him that the IRS rejected his TY
2018 federal income tax return because of an improper PIN code. (AE 4) He mailed in a
paper copy of his tax return to the IRS in response to the October 15, 2019 Turbo Tax
email. (AE C) The DOHA interrogatories and at his hearing, he was advised his TY 2018
tax  transcript  showed  no  return  was  filed.  (Tr.  41;  GE  3  at  23;  GE  9) When  Applicant
contacted the IRS on August 31, 2022, the IRS advised him he should refile his TY 2018
federal  income  tax  return.  (HE  3)  He  plans  to  refile  his  TY  2018  tax  return  early  in
September 2022. (Id.) I have credited Applicant with showing good faith in his efforts to
timely file his TY 2018 federal income tax return. No adverse inference is drawn from the
filing of this federal income tax return for TY 2018.
Applicant’s  TY  2016  IRS  tax  transcript  shows  he  owed  $22,338  on  August  30,
2021, and he owed $18,801 as of September 2022. (GE 3; AE 5) His tax refunds for TYs
2017, 2019, and 2020 were transferred to address his TY 2016 federal income tax debt.
His TY 2016 IRS tax transcript shows the following payments in 2021 and 2022: $352
(Nov. 8, 2021); $352 (January 5, 2022); $352 (February 14, 2022); $270 (April 15, 2022);
$107 (April 15, 2022); $373 (May 20, 2022); $373 (June 21, 2022); and $373 (July 20,
2022). (Tr. 33-34; AE 5) The August 22, 2022 payment of $373 was dishonored and the
IRS imposed a $25 penalty. (AE 5)
An IRS summary shows Applicant made the following payments to the IRS.

In Applicant’s August 13, 2021 response to DOHA interrogatories, he provided an
unsigned installment agreement request in which he offered to pay $500 monthly to the
IRS to address his federal income tax debt for TY 2016. (GE 3) According to the IRS tax
transcript for TY 2016, on September 23, 2019, an installment agreement was established
with the IRS. (AE 5) On September 30, 2019, he paid $175, and on September 30, 2019,
he paid $225. (Id.) On May 2, 2021, the IRS removed him from the installment agreement.
(Id.) On November 2, 2021, a new installment agreement was established. (Id.)
On November 7, 2021, Applicant paid $352, even though he did not expect the
IRS  to finalize  his payment  agreement  of  $352 monthly for 72 months  until December
2021. (HE 3 at 12) On August 22, 2022, he paid $373, and on September 6, 2022, he
paid  $373.  (AE  5)  According  to  the  IRS  payment  activity  document,  these  last  two
payments were being processed. (Id.) He conceded he failed to comply with a previous
agreement with the IRS because he believed the monthly payment was too high. (Id.) He
explained the IRS wanted him to make monthly payments of at least $400, and he wanted
a lower monthly payment. (Tr. 34) Resolution of Applicant’s tax issues was also delayed
due to understaffing at the IRS and the pandemic. (Tr. 42, 44-45)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges an account placed for collection for $713.  This debt resulted
from a dispute Applicant had with his landlord. (Tr. 48-51) Applicant delayed paying for
this debt because he disputed his responsibility for it. (HE 3 at 4-5) On November 5, 2021,
Applicant paid the creditor $590, and the creditor indicated the balance owed is $0. (Id.
at 15) This debt is resolved. (Tr. 48, 52-53)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a medical account placed for collection for $673. This was an
ambulance bill from several years ago. (Tr. 55-56) Applicant informed the creditor that the
debt was supposed to be paid by his insurance; the creditor agreed; and the debt was
removed from his credit report. (HE 3 at 5; AE 6)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges a medical account placed for collection for $144. (GE 3 at 17)
On  November  8,  2021,  Applicant  paid  the  creditor  $215.  (HE  3  at  17)  This  debt  is
resolved. (Tr. 57)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  an  account  placed  for  collection  for  $484.  Applicant  said  he
settled this debt on November 24, 2021. (HE 3 at 7) This debt is resolved. (Tr. 58-60)
SOR ¶ 1.f  alleges a  delinquent student-loan account  for about $80,000.  In August
2003, Applicant was fired  his job, and  his student  loans  became  delinquent.  (Tr. 21, 63-
66;  HE  3   at  8)  He  said  he   made   some   payments  before  his  student  loans  became
delinquent. (Tr.  63-64) He did not provide  documentary  corroboration  that he  made  these
payments. He  returned  to  college  and  received  a  master’s degree  in  2005. (Id.) He was
underemployed  for 10  years. He said  he  tried  “on  multiple  times, to  reform  that  loan  and
to  set up  some  kind  of  payment arrangement with  my  services.  I was rebuffed  doing  that.”
(Tr. 21, 69) He said he  attempted  to  rehabilitate  the  loan; however, the  creditor wanted
an  initial payment  of $20,000.  (Id.) He  did  not provide  any  documentation  showing  the
creditor wanted an initial payment of  $20,000  before he could begin repaying his student
loan. The  creditor threatened  to  garnish  Applicant’s wages, and  then  elected  not to  do  so.
(Tr. 68) Applicant believed his income was too low to warrant garnishment. (Tr. 69)
On   November  19,   2019,  Applicant   said   his   student-loan   account   was  recently
transferred  to  the  Department of  Education  (DoEd), and  he  intends to  use  the  nine-month
loan   rehabilitation   program   to   bring   his  loan   out   of  default  status.  (HE   3   at   8)   At   his
hearing, he  estimated  his student loan  debt  might be  $90,000.  (Tr. 62)  He  said  some  of
his debt  or late  charges might  be  waived  it he  completed  a  reform  period. (Tr. 62) In  June
2022, he  submitted  documentation  such  as  a  budget,  pay  records,  and  bills, to  apply  for
a “Fresh  Start”  payment plan  that would enable  rehabilitation  of  his student loans. (Tr. 71-
72;  AE  7;  AE  9) He  said  he  was continuing  to  work on  rehabilitating  his student  loans.  (Tr.
24) The Fresh Start program begins in October 2022. (AE 9)
In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the DoEd placed federal
student  loans  in  forbearance.  The  DoEd  extended  the  student  loan  payment  pause
through December 31, 2022. The pause includes the following relief measures for eligible
loans:  a  suspension  of  loan  payments;  a  0%  interest  rate;  and  stopped  collections  on
loans.  See  Federal  Student  Aid  website,  https://studentaid.gov/
defaulted
announcements-events/covid-19.  The  President  announced  forgiveness  of  $10,000  of
student loan debt; however, Applicant may be ineligible for the forgiveness because his
income  exceeds  $125,000.  (Id.)  There  are  other  programs  Applicant  is  researching  to
resolve his student loan debts. (AE 7; AE 9)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges an account placed for collection for $1,263. On November 16,
2021, Applicant paid $948 and settled this debt. (HE 3 at 9-10, 18) This debt is resolved.
(Tr. 60-62)
Applicant has taken  actions to  reduce  his expenses. (Tr. 25) He moved, and  his
rent and  utilities are  lower. (Tr. 25, 73-74)  He  has  about $1,000 monthly  available to pay
his  student  loan   and   tax   debt.   (Tr.   73)   He   enrolled   in   a   consumer  debt  and   credit
counseling  course,  and  he plans  on  taking  another credit  counseling  course.  (Tr. 2  7, 77-
79)   His  June   23,  2022   credit  report  indicates  all   15   accounts  are   in  “pays  as  agreed”
status. (GE 8)
