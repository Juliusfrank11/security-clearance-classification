Applicant  is  a  47-year-old  whose  employment  with  a  defense  contractor  is
contingent  upon  obtaining  a  security  clearance.  He  has  worked  for  an  employer  that
does  not  require  that  he  hold  a  security  clearance  since  about  July  2020.  From
approximately 2007  until  about  July 2019,  he  alternated  between  being  self-employed
and  working  for  government  contractors  in  the  information  technology  (IT)  field.  He
earned a bachelor’s degree in 1999. He was married from August 2016 until April 2022,
when  he  finalized  his divorce.  However,  he  has  lived  separate  and  apart  from  his  ex-
spouse beginning in about 2019. He has a former stepson who is 20-years-old and two
daughters who are 25 and 17 years old. His youngest daughter lives with Applicant and
he  is  financially  responsible  for  her.  He  provides  financial  support  as  needed  for  his
adult child. He was awarded a position of public trust in 2007. (Transcript (Tr.) at 23-36;

The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  eight  delinquent  debts  totaling  about
$49,000. The majority of the total of Applicant’s SOR delinquencies is comprised of two
Federal student loans totaling about $41,500 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b). Applicant also has
delinquent  credit  cards  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c  through  1.f)  and  medical  debts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.g  and
1.h). In his SOR Response, Applicant admitted the Guideline F allegations contained in
¶¶  1.a  through  1.d  and  1.f  with  additional  comments.  He  denied  the  Guideline  F
allegations  contained  in  ¶¶  1.e,  1.g.,  and  1.h  with  additional  comments.  Applicant’s
admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  Despite  Applicant’s  denials  in  his  SOR
Response,  those  allegations  are  established  by  the  Government’s  evidence,  including
credit reports. (SOR Response; GE 1-5; AE 1, 2, 4)
Applicant provided  a  June  21, 2022  document from  the  Department of  Education
that reflects that the delinquent student loans alleged  in SOR ¶¶  1.a and 1.b are in good
standing   as  of   that  date.   Applicant  testified   that,   beginning   about  a   year  ago,  he
contacted   his   student loan   service  provider and  made  nine  monthly   payments   of  $143
and   one  payment of  $149   in order   to   become   eligible  for an   income-based   repayment
plan.  Applicant  also  provided   a   document   from  his  loan   servicer  stating   that   he   is
currently  enrolled  in an  income-based  repayment plan  with  no  required  payments until
about  August  2023,  at   the   earliest.  From   approximately   2010   until 2020, Applicant  did
not make  any  payments on  these  student loans.  (Tr. 20, 38-45; SOR Response; GE  1-
5; AE 1, 2)
Applicant  provided  a  July  2022  letter  from  the  creditor  showing  that  he  has
entered into a payment arrangement with it to pay $90 per month on the $6,419 credit-
card debt in SOR ¶ 1.c  until it is satisfied.  He began making these payments in about
May  2022.  This  account  became  delinquent  in  about  July  2019  when  Applicant  lost  a
job. (Tr. 45-47; SOR Response; GE 1-5; AE 4)
Applicant  has  not  taken  any  action  to  address  the  credit  card  debt  for  $692
alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.d.  The  latest  activity  date  on  the  credit  reports  for  this  account  is
August 2019. (Tr. 47; Response to SOR; GE 2-5)
Applicant  claimed  that,  in  February  2022,  he  sent  a  dispute  letter  to  the  credit-
card company holding the debt for $509 in SOR ¶ 1.e. The basis of his dispute is that
he does not believe that he owes the full amount alleged. Applicant has not heard back
from the creditor and has not tried to contact the creditor again.  He has not made any
payments  on  this  debt.  He  did  not  provide  a  copy  of  his  dispute  letter  or  any
documentation supporting his dispute. (Tr. 47-50; Response to SOR; GE 2-5)
Applicant  has  not  taken  any  action  to  address  the  credit  card  debt  for  $447
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f. The activity date on the credit report for this account is April 2014.
He plans to address this debt in the future. (Tr. 50; Response to SOR; GE 2, 3)
Applicant  claimed   that   he   disputed   the   medical  debts  listed   in   SOR  ¶¶   1.g   and
1.h  because  he  had  medical insurance  through  his  employer. The  debts  were incurred
as a  result of  a  hand  injury A  pplicant suffered  in 2017.  Applicant claimed  he  sent a  letter
disputing  these  debts  to  the  medical provider and  believes that  he  received  a  letter from
the  provider acknowledging  that  he  no  longer owed  the  debts.  Applicant did not  provide
any  documentation  to corroborate  that  he disputed the  debt.  He  also  did not  provide any
documentation   showing   that  his  dispute   of   the   debt  had   been   resolved   in  his  favor  or
that it is no  longer owed. These  debts appear on  the  2019  credit report but not on  the
2020 or 2021 credit reports. (Tr. 51-52; Response  to SOR; GE 3)
In about 2001, Applicant filed a petition in Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and received a
discharge.  Applicant  purchased  a  home  about  22  years  ago.  In  2006  or  2007,  he
deeded the home to his parents in order to avoid it being foreclosed upon. Despite living
in  another  home,  Applicant’s  parents  pay  the  approximately  $1,267  mortgage  each
month. Applicant pays his parents about $700 each month to go towards that mortgage.
He lost his job in approximately July 2019 and claims that loss of employment caused
his  current  financial  difficulties.  Applicant  earns  about  $46,000  per  year  at  his  current
job.  He  would  make  more  money  if  he  worked  for  the  government  contractor  that
requires him to hold a security clearance.  (Tr. 25-33; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  has  a  significant  history  of  criminal  offenses,  including  drug-related
offenses.  In  about  September  2018,  he  was  charged  with  second  degree  child  abuse
and  assault  in  State  A  after  a  physical  altercation  with  his  then  15-year-old  stepson.
Applicant claims that he  got in his stepson’s face  and  grabbed  his stepson  by the  shirt
collar after hearing his stepson cursing. He claims his stepson suffered a “scratch” from
the altercation. Applicant stated that his stepson’s grandfather filed the charges against
him, but agreed to drop the charges after discussing the incident with Applicant. State A
dropped  the  charges  against  Applicant  and  the  charges  were  expunged.  (Tr.  52-58;
Response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE 5)
In  about  May  2016,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  felony  threat  to
kidnap or injure a person and misdemeanor simple assault in City B. He spent the night
in jail. This charge arose from an incident where Applicant and his then girlfriend (now
ex-spouse) were arguing in or around their vehicle on the side of the road after a night
out  at  a  club.  Applicant  claimed  there  was  no  physical  contact  between  him  and  the
alleged  victim,  but  that  he  was  upset  and  continued  to  “mouth  off,”  after  the  police
arrived, so he was arrested. He claimed that the charges against him were dropped and
that  the  alleged  victim  did  not  press  charges.  Throughout  the  clearance  investigative
process,  and  until  after  significant  cross-examination,  Applicant  consistently  confused
this arrest with his 2018 arrest.  (Tr. 60-65; GE 2, 6)
In about March 2011, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony  possession
of   a   dangerous  controlled   substance   with   intent  to   distribute   in   State   A.  He   was
convicted  of this crime. Stemming  from  the  same  arrest, he  was also charged  with  two
other   misdemeanors   relating   to   drug   possession,  but   the   prosecutor  moved   to   nolle
prosequi  these   misdemeanor  charges  and   they   were  dismissed.   Applicant  received   a
sentence  of five  years in jail with  four years,  nine  months and  ten  days suspended,  and
three years of probation.  He has complied with all of the terms of  this conviction.  (Tr. 65-
67; Response to SOR; GE  1, 2,  6)
In  about  April  2011,  Applicant  was  indicted  on  two  criminal  counts  in  federal
district court. The first count was conspiracy to commit theft of government property, a
felony. The second count was theft of government property, also a felony. In about 2009
and 2010, Applicant and an associate were selling stolen U.S. Government computers
that Applicant claims were no longer in use. Applicant claims that his role in this scheme
was  to  make  sure  the computers were  clean  and  then  re-install software  on  them.  He
also  received  some  of  the  profits  from  the  sale  of  these  stolen  computers.  Applicant
pleaded guilty to  count  one of  the indictment,  while  count  two  was  dismissed.  He was
sentenced to two months in prison and was on supervised release for two years. He has
complied with all of the terms of this conviction. (Tr. 72-76; Response to SOR; GE 2, 7)
In April 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with misdemeanor carrying a
concealed weapon in State C. Applicant claims that he had a gun in his car because he
had been shooting at a gun range  the day before the arrest. The police found the gun
when they pulled him over for a moving violation. Applicant was convicted and received
a 90-day suspended sentence, which he completed without incident.  (Tr. 76-77; GE 1,
2, 6; AE 3)
In November 1997, Applicant was arrested in State D for having marijuana in his
car  and  charged  with  felony  maintaining  a  vehicle  for  keeping  controlled  substances.
This charge was dismissed. He was also charged with felony possession with intent to
distribute a nonnarcotic schedule I controlled substance. This charge was reduced to a
lesser misdemeanor charge of which Applicant was convicted. Finally, he was charged
with  and  convicted  of  misdemeanor  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia.  However,  in
1998  he  was  pardoned  by  the  Governor  of  State  D  for  the  possession  of  drug
paraphernalia  conviction  for  a  reason  not  in  evidence.  (Tr.  77-78;  Response  to  SOR;
GE 1, 2, 6)
In  March  1997,  Applicant  was  arrested  in  State  D  and  charged  with  felony
possession  of  a  weapon  in  a  safe  school  zone  and  felony  possession  of  a  concealed
deadly weapon. Both of these charges were dismissed.  (Tr. 78-79; Response to SOR;
GE 2, 6)
In  February  1995,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  felony  fraud,  theft
over  $500  in  State  D.  Applicant  was  also  charged  with  felony  conspiracy  and
misdemeanor theft under $500. Applicant was allowing merchandise to be stolen from
his  place  of  employment  without  reporting  it.  He  was  ultimately  found  guilty  of
in
theft  under  $500  and  misdemeanor  agreement
misdemeanor
misdemeanor criminal conduct.  He was  ordered  to  pay restitution for the  property that
was stolen. (Tr. 79-80; Response to SOR; GE 2, 6)

In  October 1994, Applicant was charged  with  misdemeanor larceny for shoplifting
“blunts” from  a  pharmacy  in State  D.  The  charges against  him  were dismissed. (Tr. 80-
81; Response to SOR; GE 6)
Applicant used  marijuana with varying frequency since the late 1990s, when he
was in college.1 While there were several years when he was not using it, such as while
he was on probation, he used marijuana again consistently from about 2014 until about
August  2019.  He  used  it  about  two  to  three  times  per  week  during  this  timeframe.
Applicant failed to divulge his 2014 through 2019 marijuana usage on his Questionnaire
for National Security Positions (SF 86) that he certified in August 2019. He claimed that
he  failed  to  divulge  this  marijuana  use  because  he  thought  that  he  only  had  to  report
drug use that was “harder” than marijuana, and because he  did not consider marijuana
to be illegal. In March and April 2010, Applicant attended and completed pre-trial drug
counseling as a condition of one of his drug offenses. (Tr. 67-72, 82-83; GE 1)
Under  Guideline  J,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant’s  2016  arrest,  his  two  2011
arrests, his 2005 arrest, his two 1997 arrests, and his 1995 and 1994 arrests. Applicant
admitted  these  arrests  in  his  SOR  Response,  with  additional  comments.  Applicant’s
Guideline  J  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  Under  Guideline  H,  the  SOR
cross-alleged  Applicant’s 2011  and 1997 drug-related arrests. (Tr. 60-81; Response to
SOR; GE 6, 7; AE 3, 5)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  has  made  mistakes  in  the  past  and  claims  to
have learned from them. He stated that he has been keeping out of trouble and that he
1  Any  adverse information  not alleged  in the  SOR, such as  Applicant’s  2001 bankruptcy, his  2018  arrest,
his   marijuana   use,   or  his   failure  to  divulge  this   use  on   his   SF   86,   cannot   be   used   for  disqualification
purposes. It may  be considered when  assessing  Applicant’s  rehabilitation, in  the  application  of  mitigating
conditions, and for the whole-person analysis.
has  matured.  He notes  his involvement  with  his church  and his attempts  to  become  a
role  model  for  those  younger  than  him.  He  says  he  is  now  more  of  a  family  man.  He
blames his youth and lack of maturity for some of his illegal actions and points out that
many  of  his  arrests  happened  decades  ago.  Applicant  provided  character  reference
letters  from  those  who  know  him  noting  his  strong  character,  selflessness,  good  work
ethic,  willingness  to  learn  from  his  mistakes,  and  positive  role  in  the  community.
Applicant  also  provided  a  document  showing  that  he  has  completed  a  2021  course  in
cybersecurity awareness. (Tr. 21-22, 83-85; Response to SOR)
