In  Applicant’s SOR response, she  denied  the  allegations in  SOR ¶¶  1.a  through
1.c. (HE 3)  She also provided mitigating information.
Applicant  is  a   32-year-old  senior  scheduling   manager  and   production   control
specialist who  has been  employed  by  a  DOD contractor for the  previous six  years. (Tr. 6,
8)  In   2008,  she   graduated   from   high   school,  and   in  2012,  she   received   a   bachelor’s
degree   with   a   major  in  biology.  (Tr.  6-7,   29-30)  She   completed   several  post-graduate
classes; however, she  has not received a  master’s degree. (Tr. 7) She has never served
in the  military. (Tr. 8) There is no  evidence  of  security  violations, arrests,  convictions,  use
of illegal drugs, or abuse of  alcohol.
Applicant was married from 2016 to 2018, and she has custody of her five-year-
old son. (Tr. 7-8) Her former husband lost his employment, and he was evicted from his
residence.  (Tr. 26)  She  tried  to  financially  assist  her former husband.  (Tr.  26) He  was
financially irresponsible, and he had other non-financial issues that showed he had a lack
of discretion and good judgment. (Tr. 66-67) Her husband was supposed to pay annual
child support of $12,500; however, he has not paid child support. (Tr. 25, 42) In 2019, she
allowed her former husband to move in with her and their son. (Tr. 41) In 2020, she forced
her  former  husband  to  move  out  of  her  residence.  (Tr.  41)  She  was  reluctant  to
aggressively pursue  child  support  from  him  because  she  did not want  him  to  insist on
more access to their son. (Tr. 67)
Financial Considerations
After graduating from college in 2012, Applicant worked part time with her father
who had medical issues, and she worked for two or three days a week at a pharmacy.
(Tr. 21, 31-32) For most of 2014, a DOD contractor employed her. (Tr. 22) She took some
additional  college  classes  in  2014.  (Tr.  30)  She  left  her  DOD-contractor  employment
because her husband wanted her to move. Next, she worked for an insurance company,
and her pay was reduced about $20,000. (Tr. 22) She followed her employment with an
insurance company with work for a restaurant. (Tr. 23)
In 2016 to 2017, Applicant focused on saving money to pay off a single-wide mobile
home. (Tr. 36) In January 2019, she paid off her vehicle loan. (Tr. 39) She recently paid
some medical debts and paid off her single-wide mobile home. (Tr. 25, 41) In May 2021,
she  sold  the  mobile  home,  and  used  $13,000  from  the  sale  as  a  down  payment  to
purchase some land and a house. Her mortgage was $91,000. (Tr. 38) She used about
$20,000 to move a home on to the land she purchased and to make necessary repairs to
this home. (Tr. 45, 53) In September 2021, she moved into the home. (Tr. 37-38; 68)
Applicant’s current  annual salary is $82,000. (Tr. 44; AE C) She has $10,000 in
her 401(k) account.  (Tr.  44) She  has  no  savings  account  balance,  and  she  has  about
$2,000 in her checking account. (Tr. 45, 54) In 2021, she purchased a used vehicle for
$36,000, and her loan balance on it is down to about $30,000. (Tr. 46) She settled some
of her delinquent credit card debts. (Tr. 63)
Applicant filed her federal income tax returns for tax year (TY) 2020 and TY 2021
in  April  2022,  and  she  owes  $3,200  to  the  IRS  for  TY  2020.  (Tr.  49-51;  AE  C)  Her
anticipated refund for TY 2021 is about $2,400, and her accountant said her refund will
be applied to her TY 2020 tax debt. (Tr. 51) She did not timely pay her taxes because she
owed money for her home repairs. (Tr. 52)
Student Loans
After Applicant graduated  from  college  in  2012, her  student loans,  which originated
before  2013, were deferred  for about  one  year. (Tr.  21, 30)  Her student  loans were a  mix
of   federal-guaranteed   loans  and   private   loans.  (Tr.  31)  She   considered   student-loan
consolidation;  however, she  preferred  to  work with  the  loans on  an  individual basis. She
recognized that some  of her payments were dispersed to all the loans. (Tr. 34; AE A; AE
B) In  May  2016, she  began  working  for her current employer. (Tr. 23) She  stopped  making
payments  to  her student loans around  late  2016  or early  2017  because  she  was unable
to  work due  to  three  of her hospitalizations  for  complications of  pregnancy,  and  after her
son  was born, he  had  some  medical problems. (Tr. 35, 54-55) She  used  medical leave
without pay. (Tr. 23,  35) When  her son  had  medical problems; she  missed  work to  take
him  to  appointments;  and  she  incurred  several medical debts.  (Tr.  25) Around  2019, a
medical creditor garnished  $900  from  her  pay over a two-month period. (Tr. 41-42)
Applicant’s  SOR  alleges  three  charged-off  student-loan  accounts  in  ¶  1.a  for
$12,517;  ¶  1.b  for  $4,713;  and  ¶  1.c  for  $2,910.  (HE  2)  Her  November  5,  2020  credit
report, the earliest credit report of record, shows the three student-loan accounts had a
high  credit  total  of  $14,352  with  a  total  balance  of  $20,140  as  shown  on  the  following
table. Eight student loans were in “pays as agreed” status, and they had a high credit of
$32,000 with a balance of $43,845.  (GE 4 at 4-7) When the balance exceeds the high
credit on a debt, a history of  the debts delinquency is established.  One account has a
balance  of  $5,500  and  a  high  credit  of  $5,500.  (GE  4  at  7)  The  $5,500  account  was
transferred, and is not included in the following table. (GE 4 at 7) This credit report also
shows nine student loans in current status with a previous history of being at least 180
days past due. (GE 4)

Applicant  received  correspondence  from  two  student-loan  entities  about  her
student-loan debts. (Tr. 34, 57) She communicated with the student-loan creditors when
she stopped making payments. (Tr. 55) After the three SOR-alleged student loans were
charged  off,  she  contacted  the  creditor  and  asked  to  resume  payments;  however,  the
creditor said the debt was “written off, so there is no account for you to make payments
on.” (Tr. 56, 58-59) After she discussed the three charged-off student-loan debts with the
Office  of  Personnel  Management  investigator,  she  emailed  the  student-loan  creditor’s
customer service address, and she asked for confirmation that she was not permitted to
pay the three debts; however, she did not receive a reply. (Tr. 62) She did not do anything
about the three SOR debts after she received the SOR. (Tr. 63) The three charged-off
debts were not owed to the Department of Education (DoEd). (GE 4) They are not listed
on her current credit report. (GE 6)
Applicant’s December 3, 2021 credit report shows the eight student loans are in
“pays account as agreed” status, and all accounts show a last payment date in October
2021. (GE 6) One account shows a $1,784 payment in March 2021 with a current balance
of zero. (GE 6 at 7) The paid-off debt was item (12) in the above table. The following table
shows the student-loan accounts on this credit report.

DoED (GE 3-6) She provided account statements from two of the three major creditors
after  her  hearing,  but  not  from  DoED.  (AE  A;  AE  B)  She  did  not  provide  the  current
balances on her accounts. It is not known whether she had an account statement from

In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the DoED placed federal
student  loans  in  forbearance.  The  DoED  extended  the  student-loan  payment  pause
through August 31, 2022. The pause includes the following relief measures for eligible
loans:  a  suspension  of  loan  payments;  a  0%  interest  rate;  and  stopped  collections  on
