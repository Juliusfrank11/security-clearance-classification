Applicant, age 54, is married with two adult children. He received his high school
diploma in 1987. He attended an online college from 2006 through 2008, without earning
a degree. He honorably served the U.S. Air Force from 1990 through 1999. He has been
employed  as  a  technical  services  analyst  by  a  defense  contractor  since  2019.  He
previously maintained a security clearance during his military service. (Item 3; Item 4 at
8; Item 5 at 13)
Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years (TY) 2014,
2015,  and  2016  (as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a)  and  also  for  TY  2017  through  2019.  I  will
consider the unalleged TY only to evaluate mitigation and the whole person. He did not
request a filing extension in any of those TY. He filed his 2014, 2015, and 2017 returns
on May 1, 2020; his 2018 and 2019 returns on October 20, 2020; and his 2016 return on
June 15, 2021. He made a $2,285 payment with his 2014 return; and a $1,683 payment
with his 2017 return. The IRS returned the 2016 return to Applicant on September 28,
2021 because it was missing a signature. He returned the signed 2016 return to the IRS
on a date not indicated in the record sometime before he submitted the Answer. (AE A at
1, 3, 4, 6, and 7; Item 2; Item 5 at 22-24)
Applicant failed  to  timely  pay  his federal  income  taxes for TY  2017  through  2019
(as  alleged   in   SOR   ¶   1.b)   and   also   for  TY   2014.  He   owed   $1,826   for  TY   2014   as   of
January  2022.  He  owed  a  total of  $3,312  for TY  2017  through  2019  as of April 2021. I will
consider the  2014  debt  only  to  evaluate  mitigation  and  the  whole person. A  January  2022
IRS   account   transcript   reflected   that  an   installment  agreement  to   repay   the   2014   debt
was established  by  the  IRS  in  November 2021.   The  terms  of that  agreement  were not
indicated   in the   transcript.   In  the   Answer, Applicant   admitted  SOR   ¶  1.b  and   stated:   “I
admit  that  I am  in  debt  to  the  Federal Government and  the  balance,  in full, has yet to  be
paid.” He  also asserted  that he  was paying  his  federal tax  debt  pursuant  to  an  installment
agreement approved  by  the  IRS  via $200  monthly  payments on  the  15th  of  each  month.
Because  the 2014  debt was not alleged, it was unclear whether his reference  to  Federal
Government “debt” included  that TY. The  document he  provided  with  the  Answer reflected
the  $200  per month  agreement, but  did not reference  any  tax years  or the  date  when  the
installment   agreement  was  established.  Applicant   did   not   proffer  documents
corroborating  any  payments made  pursuant to  IRS  besides those  he  submitted  with  his
returns. (AE A  at 1-2, 4; Item  5 at 22-24)
Applicant also failed to timely file his state income tax returns and to pay his state
income taxes for TY 2014 through 2019. As of April 2021, he owed a total of $13,879 for
TY 2014 through 2019, which the state agreed he could pay via $1,164 monthly payments
to begin April 8, 2021. Although the filing dates were not equivocally stated in the record,
he apparently filed his TY 2014 through 2019 state returns sometime between May 2020
and April 2021. Because the SOR alleged only the state tax debt owed (SOR ¶ 1.c), I will
consider his failure to timely file state returns only to evaluate mitigation and the whole
person.  In  a  personal  financial  statement  Applicant  completed  in  June  2021,  he
referenced a $268 monthly payment for state taxes, but did not provide any proof of those
payments. In the Answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 1.c and asserted that he was paying
his  state  tax  debt  pursuant  to  an  installment  agreement  approved  by  the  state.  The
document he provided with the Answer to corroborate that agreement reflected that  he
made one $320 payment on November 19, 2021, but did not reference any tax years or
the terms of the agreement. Applicant did not proffer documents corroborating any other
payments made pursuant to the agreement. (Item 3 at 39-41; Item 4 at 2-3; Item 5 at 15,
20-21)
During Applicant’s April 2020 subject interview (SI), he attributed his delay in filing
TY 2014 through 2017 returns to traveling so frequently for work and what he described
as miscommunication with his wife. He explained that he never explicitly asked his wife
whether the tax returns had been filed, but just assumed that they had.  He maintained
that he simply forgot to file his TY 2018 returns and had not yet filed his TY 2019 returns
due  to  COVID-19.  I  took  administrative  notice  of  the  fact  that  the  IRS  extended  the
deadline for TY 2019 returns to July 15, 2020. (Item 4 at 2-3, 8)
During  the  SI,  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  was  not  good  at  filing  and
maintaining paperwork and had never made his finances, including taxes, a priority in his
life. He claimed that he was not aware that his wife had not filed their TY 2014 through
2017 returns until sometime in 2018, when he was going through years of unopened mail
and noticed a bunch of employee withholding (W-4) forms. He explained that piles and
piles  of  unopened  mail  had  accumulated  at  his  home  while  he  was  travelling  for  work
between 2015 and 2018. Although his wife did check the mail during that time, she never
opened  any  mail  addressed  to  Applicant  or  any  mail  involving  taxes  or  employee
withholding forms. (Item 4 at 3-4)
During the SI, Applicant acknowledged that he could have been more proactive in
dealing with his mail and other important information since he only traveled for work two
weeks  of  every  month.  He  decided  to  finally  go  through  his  mail  in  2018  because  he
realized that he was getting older and wanted to get his financial life in order in preparation
for retirement. He planned to avoid future filing delays by asking his son-in-law (who had
recently earned a finance degree) to handle his tax filings every year. He expressed his
regret for assuming that his taxes were taken care of by his wife and promised to work
hard to avoid that miscommunication in the future. (Item 4 at 4-5)
In Applicant’s November 2020 SCA, he provided the following explanation for why
he failed to timely file his federal and state returns for TY 2014 through 2017: “working as
[sic] contractor moving from contract to contract, I thought my wife had filed them and she
thought I filed them.” He did not provide a reason for TY 2018 and 2019. The information
he  provided  in  the  SCA  about  the  status  of  his  return  filings  and  tax  payments  was
confusing,  which  suggested  that  he  apparently  either  partially  filled  out  or  completed
another  SCA  prior  to  November  2020  that  was  not  included  in  the  record  (particularly
since he was interviewed in April 2020). Nevertheless, Applicant clearly articulated that
he had been working with the state tax authority to resolve his state tax issues and sought
out professional financial and legal advice to help him resolve his federal tax issues. He
indicated that his delinquent state and federal tax returns had either been filed or were in
the process of being filed, and that he intended to remediate any associated delinquent
taxes or penalties. (Item 3 at 39-41)
In Applicant’s June 2021 response to interrogatories propounded by the CAF, he
attributed the miscommunication with his wife about their TY 2014 through 2017 taxes to
the fact that she worked at night so they did not talk much. He declared that the “USA is
[his] beloved home,” and that he was trying to correct his mistakes and doing his best to
fix the concerns identified by the CAF. (Item 5 at 13-14)
