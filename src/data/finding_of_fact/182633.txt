Financial Considerations
Applicant’s  11  delinquent  SOR  debts  totaling  $82,156  are  established  by  her
March  26,  2021  SF-86;  her  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  background
investigation  conducted  from  May  26,  2021  to  June  14,  2021,  containing  her  June  1,
2021 OPM Personal Subject Interview (PSI); her May 21, 2021 and November 4, 2021
credit reports; and her December 1, 2021 SOR Answer. (Items 3 – 7)
Applicant explained  that some  of her  admitted  personal loan  and  credit card debt
was  incurred   to   pay   court costs and   legal fees  associated   with   her husband’s custody
dispute  with  his ex-wife, which began  in  2015. (Items 3, 5) She  acquired  additional debt
and  her accounts became  delinquent when  she  was laid  off  from  her former job  in  April
2016   and   remained   unemployed   for   about   ten   months.   (Item   3,  4,   5)   Additionally,
Applicant’s husband   was unemployed   from  November 2020  to   April 2021, and   he  was
laid   off   again  in  about  June   2021   during   the   COVID-19   pandemic.  (Item   5)   Finally,
Applicant  explained   that  she   incurred   some   additional  debt  resulting   from   paying   her
husband’s  out-of-pocked   healthcare  costs,   which  total  over  $10,000   annually   and
without which he would be permanently disabled  and  unable to work. (Item 3)
The following is a summary of Applicant’s 11 SOR debts and their current status.
SOR ¶ 1.a – Past-due personal loan account in the amount of $3,374. Applicant
admitted  this  allegation.  She  took  this  loan  out  in  2015  to  pay  her  husband’s  attorney
fees  in  a  post-divorce  dispute  with  his  ex-wife.  She  made  her  last  payment  on  this
account in 2016. She added that she has been working with a credit-repair company to
negotiate a lesser amount. Applicant did not submit any documentation supporting her
negotiation efforts. (Items 3, 6) DEBT NOT RESOLVED.
SOR  ¶  1.b  –  Collection  medical  account  in  the  amount  of  $4,995.  Applicant
admitted his allegation. This debt is for her husband’s uncovered medical costs in 2016.
This account has been delinquent since 2016. (Items 3, 6) Applicant did not submit any
documentation  identifying  her  resolution  efforts,  if  any,  to  address  this  account.  DEBT
NOT RESOLVED.
SOR  ¶  1.c  –  Collection  personal  loan  account  in  the  amount  of  $27,490.
Applicant  admitted  this  allegation.  She  took  this  loan  out  in  2016  to  pay  husband’s

efforts, if any, to address this account. DEBT NOT RESOLVED.
SOR ¶ 1.d – Collection student loan account in the amount of $3,871. Applicant
denied this allegation. She stated that she was charged for a semester that she did not
attend and had “many conversations with the school about the charge for classes.” The
college she attended notified her in 2017 that she owed a balance for three classes that
she  dropped  after  registration.  She  contends  that,  because  she  dropped  the  classes,
she does not owe the college for the credits, and as of her June 1, 2021 OPM PSI, she
had not taken any action to resolve the debt.  (Items 3,6) DEBT NOT RESOLVED.
SOR  ¶  1.e  –  Collection  credit  card  account  in  the  amount  $3,860.  Applicant
denied this allegation. She stated that this account, “is wrongfully indebted to me,” and
that she is working with a credit-repair company to have this account removed from her
credit report. Her credit report indicates that this account was opened in 2015 and her
last payment was made in 2106. (Items 3, 6) Applicant provided no explanation for her
change in position regarding liability. DEBT NOT RESOLVED.
SOR ¶ 1.f - Collection personal loan account in the amount of $24,508. Applicant
denied this allegation. She opened this account in about 2014 and used it to pay for her
wedding and her husband’s custody dispute. She  was unable to remain current on her
payments after her 2016 layoff, but after securing a new job in 2017 and stabilizing her
finances,  Applicant  contacted  the  lender  and  arranged  a  settlement  for  $5,000.  She
stated  that  she,  “paid  this  entire  balance  in  full,  but  disagreement  on  the  remaining
interest has projected the entire balance.” She  added  that she is working  with  a credit-
repair  company  to  have  this  account  removed  from  her  credit  report.  (Items  3,  6)
Applicant did not submit any documentation identifying her resolution efforts to address
this account. DEBT NOT RESOLVED.
SOR  ¶   1.g   –   Collection   medical  account  in   the   amount  of   $8,251.  Applicant
admitted   this  allegation.  She   incurred   this  debt  in  2018.  She   stated   that  she   was
negotiating   the   balance   to   a   lesser  amount  of   $700   that  would  be,   “paid  in  full   before
January   31st ,   2022.”   (Items   3,6) It   is   unclear  from  the   FORM   when   or if  she   made  her
last   payment.   Applicant  did   not  submit  any   documentation   supporting   her  negotiation
efforts.  DEBT NOT RESOLVED.

working with credit repair to remove.” It is unclear from the FORM what this debt was for
or  when  or  if  she  made  her  last  payment.  (Items  2,  3,  6,  7)  Applicant  provided  no
documentation to support her denial of liability. DEBT NOT RESOLVED.
SOR  ¶  1.i  –  Collection  medical  account  in  the  amount  of  $660.  Applicant
admitted  this  allegation.  She  incurred  this  debt  in  2015  to  pay  for  her  husband’s
uncovered medical treatment. She stated that she, “is working on getting this paid in full
with  a  reduction  in balance  while  working  with  the  credit repair  company.” It  is  unclear
from  the  FORM  when  she  made her last payment.  (Items 2, 3, 6, 7)  Applicant did  not
submit any documentation supporting her negotiation efforts. DEBT NOT RESOLVED.
SOR  ¶  1.j  –  Collection  medical  account  in  the  amount  of  $179.  Applicant
admitted  this  allegation.  She  incurred  this  debt  in  2018  to  pay  for  her  husband’s
uncovered  medical  treatment.  She  stated,  “I  have  since  paid  this  debt  in  full  with  the
collection agency.” However, Applicant did not submit any documentation corroborating
her claim of payment. (Items 3, 6) DEBT NOT RESOLVED.
SOR ¶ 1.k – Collection medical account in the amount of $85. Applicant admitted
this  allegation.  She  incurred  this  debt  in  2016.  It  is  unclear  from  the  FORM  what  this
debt  was  for  or  when  or  if  she  made  her  last  payment.  She  stated  that  she  “will  be
working  with  the  credit  repair  to  reduce  this medical charge  to  pay  off.” (Items 3, 6, 7)
Applicant  did  not  submit  any  documentation  supporting  her  negotiation  efforts.  DEBT
NOT RESOLVED.
The  only  documentation  that  Applicant  submitted  was  that  accompanying  her
SOR Answer: (1) her marriage certificate to her husband; (2) a family court Register of
Actions  describing  litigation  events  between  her  husband  and  his  ex-wife;  and  (3)  a
credit-repair  company  email dated  September  27,  2021  with  access  details  to  login  to
her credit-repair company. (Item 3) However, as  Department Counsel explained in her
FORM, Applicant’s documentation leaves it unclear what services are being provided by
the  credit-repair  company  and  what  accounts  are  included  in  services  to  be  provided.
Applicant  did  not  submit  any  information  after  receiving  her  FORM  that  would  have
addressed any of these shortcomings.
Applicant stated that she is an outstanding citizen and had no debt before 2015.
She recapped her extenuating circumstances and the life events that led to her financial
difficulties. She further stated that she will not be able to complete her job tasks unless
she has a secret clearance. She added that she is a law-abiding citizen and would not
under  any  circumstances  betray  her  country  as  a  result  of  her  debt.  She  works  very
hard  and  supports  a  disabled  husband  and  three  children.  Additionally,  she  receives
health  insurance  through  her  job  that  is  necessary  to  ensure  that  she  and  her  family
members receive proper medical care. (Item 3)
