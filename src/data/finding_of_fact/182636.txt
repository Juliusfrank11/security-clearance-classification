Applicant is 48 years old, married and has two children (ages seven and ten) and
two stepchildren (ages 25 and 28). He received his high school diploma in 1992 and has
taken  some  college  courses.  In  2006  Applicant  applied  for  a  trustworthiness
determination. DOHA granted him eligibility in March 2007. Applicant is now the co-owner
and a senior management officer of a technology company (the Company), which he co-
founded  in  2011.  He  is  also  the  Facility  Security  Officer  (FSO)  of  the  Company.  The
Company  has  about  12  employees.  Applicant  was  granted  eligibility  for  a  Secret
clearance in November 2018. The Company is now seeking facility clearance eligibility to
work  on  Top  Secret  DoD  contracts.  As  one  of  the  Company’s  Key  Management
Personnel, Applicant is also seeking eligibility at the Top Secret level  as a requirement
for the upgrade of the Company’s facility clearance. (Answer at 1-2; Tr. at 28, 43-51; GE
4 at 1; AE B at 1, 3, 4.)
Paragraph 1  - Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance  Misuse
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because of his recent drug involvement. Specifically, the SOR alleged that Applicant used
marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from  about  August  2019  through  March  2021  (SOR
1.a). The SOR also alleged that Applicant used marijuana after he had been granted a
security clearance in November 2018 (SOR 1.b). In his Answer, Applicant admitted both
allegations under this guideline. (Answer at 1.)
In 2019 Applicant started smoking marijuana at the request of his wife. They lived
in  State  A  where  it  was  legal  to  purchase  and  possess  marijuana.  His  wife  was
experiencing anxiety, and she wanted to use marijuana to ease her discomfort and help
her sleep at night. When the Company was given the opportunity in 2021 to work on a
DoD contract that required the Company to have a Top Secret facility clearance, Applicant
knew that he would need to upgrade his clearance, and he stopped smoking marijuana.
His wife continued to occasionally smoke marijuana alone in the family’s garage before
retiring to sleep. Applicant submitted his e-QIP for his upgraded clearance a couple of
months later. He disclosed his marijuana use in his e-QIP and wrote that he used it about
40-50 times during the period August 2019 to March 2021. He wrote, “When it was noted
that existing contract work would require potential to upgrade to a TS I thought I probably
should  not  use  [marijuana].”  At  the  hearing,  he  confirmed  these  dates,  the  estimated
number of times he used marijuana, and his motivation for ceasing his marijuana use in
about March 2021 before submitting his May 2021 e-QIP. (Tr. at 40-41, 45-47, 49; GE 1
at 35-36.)
Paragraph 2  - Guideline  E, Personal Conduct
The  Government alleges in this paragraph  that Applicant is ineligible  for  clearance
because   he   has  engaged   in  conduct   that  involves  questionable   judgment,   an
unwillingness to  follow  rules and  regulations,  lack of  candor, and  dishonesty. The  SOR
cross-alleged  under this guideline  the  two  Guideline  H allegations described  above  (SOR
2.a). The  SOR also alleged  that Applicant was arrested  and  charged  with  Driving  Under
the   Influence   of   Alcohol  (DUI)  on   two   occasions,  once   in  August   2000   and   again  in
November  2004   (SOR  2.b   and   2.c).  The   SOR  sets   forth   two   additional  allegations
involving  Applicant’s failure to  disclose  the  November 2004  DUI arrest in his 2021  e-QIP
and   in  a   prior  e-QIP,  certified   by   Applicant  on   April  6,   2017   (2017   e-QIP).  Applicant
allegedly  falsified  his responses under Section  22  - Police  Record (EVER)  (SOR 2.d  and
2.e)  in both  e-QIPs. The  specific questions also use  the  unlimited  timeframe  of  “EVER,”
with  the  emphasis in the  original e-QIP  texts  in both  the  section  titles  and  in the  questions.
In   his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted   the   allegations  in  subparagraphs   2.a   through
2.c. He  denied  the  falsification  allegations in  SOR 2.d  and  2.e. He  accompanied  those
denials with  explanations.  He wrote  that the  omission  of his second  DUI arrest in 2004  in
his 2017  e-QIP  and  the  omission  of  both  arrests in his 2021  e-QIP  was not intentional
and  was due  to  a  misunderstanding.  He wrote  that  he  fully  disclosed  both  DUIs  during  his
background interviews in 2017 and  2021.  (Answer at 1-2.)
Applicant  discussed  his  DUIs  in  his  2021  background  interview.  He  told  the
investigator  that  his failure  to  disclose  his  2000  DUI  in  his  2021  e-QIP  was  due  to  an
oversight.  He  disclosed  it  under  questions  dealing  with  alcohol  counseling.  He  also
reported that he did not disclose the 2004 DUI due to a misunderstanding. (GE 3 at 8-9.)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  his failure  to  completely disclose  his  DUI
arrests in his two most recent e-QIPs was unintentional. Applicant noted that he disclosed
his  2000  DUI  in  the  2021  e-QIP  in  response  to  questions  in  Section  24  titled  “Use  of
Alcohol.” He omitted his 2004 DUI due to a “clerical mistake.” He did not believe he had
to  repeat  in  his  2021  e-QIP  all  of  the  details  in  his  2017  e-QIP  and  from  his  prior
investigations. The record does not contain the summaries of his background interviews
from his prior investigations. In his 2017 e-QIP he disclosed his 2000 arrest, but not his
2004 arrest. He said that omission was due to a misunderstanding. He also noted that he
fully disclosed his recent use of marijuana and disclosed his DUI arrests in his background
interviews. He also testified that he no longer drinks alcohol because he has developed
an allergic reaction to alcohol. (Tr. at 37-42, 50-51; GE 2 at 37.)
Mitigation  and Whole-Person Evidence
Applicant’s  business  partner  testified  in  support  of  Applicant.  The  witness  has
known Applicant since 2009 and has worked closely with him since then. They started
their business together in 2011. The witness believes Applicant has “amazing integrity”
and  appreciates  Applicant’s  honesty  since  they  are  partners.  He  and  Applicant  have
discussed the differences between Federal law and the law in State A where they both
live and work. (Tr. at 21-29.)
Applicant’s wife  also testified. She  has  known  Applicant for 13  years. The  first time
he  smoked  marijuana  was with  her in the  summer or fall of  2019. They  last  used  marijuana
together  in the  first  quarter of 2021.  She  asked  Applicant  to  smoke  marijuana  with  her
because   she   was  nervous  and   suffering   from   anxiety.  She   was  experiencing   difficulty
sleeping, and  she  thought that  marijuana  might help  her condition.   She  did  not want  to
use  marijuana  alone.  She  has  seen  Applicant use  marijuana  30-40  times  during  the  2019-
to-2021   period.  She   continues  to   use   marijuana   for  her  anxiety   and   has  smoked
marijuana  as recently  as a  couple of months  before the  hearing. She  does  not use  the
drug  in the  presence  of  her husband. She  smokes at  before bedtime  in  their  garage  away
from the couple’s children. (Tr. at 29-36.)
