Applicant is 33  years old  and married with three children. He has a  high school
education and has been employed by a defense contractor since November 2020 in a
FC. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A, and 17.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  failed  to  meet  his  financial  obligations  and  is  therefore  potentially
unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
Applicant admitted both allegations in the SOR. He also submitted additional information
to support the granting of national security eligibility.
The Government alleged in paragraph 1 of the SOR that Applicant had not filed
his  2017,  2018,  or  2019  Federal  tax  returns.  Paragraph  2  of  the  SOR  alleged  that
Applicant had not filed his 2017, 2018, or 2019 State A tax returns.
Applicant is a native-born American citizen. He was also a citizen of FC because
his mother is a citizen of FC, where she currently lives. He lived in the United States until
December 2017, when he moved to FC for better employment opportunities  and to be
close  to  his  family.  Applicant  worked  for  different  FC  firms  from  January  2018  until
November 2020, when he began working for his current employer. During the period he
was employed by FC firms Applicant was paid in the local currency. (Tr. 14; Government
Exhibit 1 at Section 13A.)
Applicant admits that he was at fault for not filing his 2017 Federal and State A tax
returns in a timely fashion. He further stated that he did not know he was required to file
Federal tax returns for 2018 and 2019. He thought that since he was employed in FC,
was a dual citizen of FC, and was paid in local currency, he did not have to file tax returns.
Applicant  eventually  determined  that  his  belief  was  in  error.  (Tr.  13-15;  Government
Exhibit 3 at 13, 25-26.)
All  or  most  of  the  salaries  of  Americans  who  are  working  and  living  full-time
overseas are exempt from Federal taxes. See Internal Revenue Service, Publication 54,
Tax  Guide  for  U.S.  Citizens  and  Resident  Aliens  Abroad,  https://www.irs.gov/forms-
pubs/about-publication-54   (accessed  September  21,  2022).  The  maximum  Foreign
Earned Income Exclusion rose from $104,100 in 2018 to $107,600 in 2020. According to
Applicant  this exclusion  would  have  covered  all of  his  income from  his  FC employers.
Such  a  situation  does  not,  however,  obviate  the  requirement  to  timely file  a  tax  return
every year. Applicant stated that he simply did not know of this requirement, (Tr. 23-24;
Government Exhibit 3 at 13.)
Applicant  did  not  have  access  to  tax  forms  for  tax  year  2017  until  recently.  He
accessed his W-2 Wage and Tax Statement for 2017 from the IRS website on December
4, 2021. He testified that he prepared and mailed his Federal tax returns for 2017 through
2019 to the Austin, Texas IRS service center on February 8, 2022, which were received
on February 28, 2022. He did not report any income for 2018 or 2019 on his Federal tax
forms because he believed income earned overseas in a foreign currency was exempt.
He did not present any evidence supporting that statement. Applicant did not retain copies
of  these  tax  returns.  As  of  the  date  the  record  closed  Applicant  had  not  received  any
response from the IRS as to whether his returns were correct or processed. (Tr. 16-17,
23-26, 38; Government Exhibit 3 at 5-12.)
Applicant had issues getting his State A tax returns to the proper office. It appears
that he has now sent them to the proper address on April 20, 2022. (Tr. 20-21; Applicant
Exhibits A at 1-2 and D at 6.)
Applicant forwarded a copy of  his State A tax returns for 2017, 2018, and 2019
that were prepared by him. They properly show that he was no longer a resident of State
A  in  2018  or  2019.  The  2017  form  submitted  to  me  is  incomplete.  The  form  shows
Applicant  owed  $2,224  in  taxes.  However,  there  is  no  information  that  Applicant  has
actually made arrangements to pay the taxes. Therefore, based on this record, I cannot
find that he has successfully filed his 2017 State A tax return. (Tr. 26-28; Applicant Exhibit
C.)
Applicant appeared to have retained a tax service firm on April 7, 2022, to file his
2017, 2018, and 2019 tax returns. No further information was received as to whether the
firm  has  actually  filed  any  of  Applicant’s  Federal  or State  A  tax  returns  for  the  subject
years. (Applicant Exhibit A at 2.)
Mitigation
Applicant submitted  a  recent  performance  review  from  his supervisor,  which stated
he  meets or exceeds expectations in every  area. In  conclusion  his supervisor stated, “HE
IS  JUST AN OVERALL OUTSTANDING MEMBER AND  GREAT ADDITION TO THE  .
. . TEAM!!!!!” (Applicant Exhibit B.) (All emphasis in original.)
