In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the four delinquent debts alleged in
the SOR. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 55-year-old information technology expert employed by a defense
contractor. He received a bachelor’s degree in June 1995 and has worked in the private
sector  since  at  least  2010.  He  married  in  August  1987,  divorced  in  August  1989,  and
remarried in November 1989. He has six children, five of whom are adults and one is 15
years old.
Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from  December  1986  to
December 1990 and received an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance while
on active duty in the Navy and in August 1996 while working on a government contract.
The  SOR  alleges  four  delinquent  debts  that  are  reflected  in  credit  reports  from
February 2021 (FORM Item 5) and November 2021 (FORM Item 6). They are a bank loan
charged off for $53,802 (SOR ¶ 1.a); a car debt charged off for $25,670 (SOR ¶ 1.b); a
car debt charged off for $9,980 (SOR ¶ 1.c); and a telecommunications account referred
for collection of $814 (SOR ¶ 1.d).
During Applicant’s interview with a security investigator in April 2021, he attributed
the  delinquent  bank  loan  to  home  projects  and  landscaping.  He  attributed  the  first
delinquent car debt to leasing a luxury car in April 2013 and the second car debt to leasing
another luxury car in December 2015. He voluntarily surrendered both cars when he was
unable to afford the payments. (FORM Item 3 at 1.)
Applicant  disclosed  in  his  SCA  that  he  traveled  outside  the  United  States  in
October and November 2018. In his security interview in April 2021, he explained that this
travel occurred when he, his wife, their youngest daughter, and two cousins went on a
one-week cruise. (FORM Item 2 at 40; FORM Item 3 at 9.)
Applicant has worked with a debt resolution agency to explore options for resolving
the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. The agency proposed three options:
Option  1: Pay off all three debts in 48 months at $1,614 per month or in 53 months
at $1,463 per month.
Option  2: Pay off the bank loan in 30 months at $1,462 per month or in 53 months
at $832 per month.
Option 3: Pay off the two car debts in 30 months at $1,154 per month.
Applicant  decided  that  all  three  options  were  too  expensive,  and  he  contacted
three home mortgage lenders to explore refinancing his home and using his equity to pay
the  three  debts.  When  he  responded  to  the  FORM,  he  was  scheduled  to  close  on  a
refinancing  of  his  home  on  June  17,  2022.  His  monthly  payments  on  the  refinanced
mortgage  will  be  $5,834.  (AX  A  at  11.)  He  provided  no  evidence  of  negotiations,
payments, or payment agreements with the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c
When  Applicant  answered  the  SOR,  he  was  making  monthly  payments  on  the
telecommunications  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.d.  In  his  response  to  the  FORM,  he
submitted evidence that the debt was paid in full.
Applicant’s spouse is a two-time cancer survivor. The record does not reflect when
her first treatments occurred. The second series of treatments began in 2015. Applicant
attributed  his financial problems  to  medical debts  that  were  not  covered  by insurance.
(FORM Item 3 at 1.) He did not provide any information about the amounts of the debts.
In  response  to  DCSA  interrogatories,  Applicant  provided  a  personal  financial
statement  dated  September  15,  2021.  He  reported  that  he  and  his  spouse  had  net
monthly income  of  $9,331;  monthly expenses  of  $1,984;  and  one  monthly  payment  of
$3,584 on the refinanced home mortgage loan. He estimated his net monthly remainder
as $3,762.
Although Applicant has met his goal of refinancing his home, he has not provided
any documentary evidence showing affordable  payment  agreements  with  the  creditors
alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and  1.c.  Even  if  he  reaches  payment agreements,  he  will
need time to establish a track record of compliance with the agreements.
