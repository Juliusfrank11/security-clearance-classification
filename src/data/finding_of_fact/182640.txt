Applicant is a 25-year-old design engineer of a defense contractor who seeks a
security  clearance.  Allegations  covered  in  the  SOR  and  admitted  by  Applicant  are
incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant has never been married and has no children. (Item 3) He earned a high
school diploma in June 2015 and bachelor’s degree in May 2020. (Item 3) Applicant did
not report any military service, and he has never held a security clearance. (GEs 1-2)
Since  November  2020,  Applicant  has  worked  for his  current  defense  contractor
as  a  design  engineer.  (Item  3)  Previously,  he  worked  for  other  employers  in  various
jobs. He has never held a security clearance. (Item 3)
Applicant’s finances
Records document that Applicant did not timely file his federal and state income
tax returns for tax years 2016 through 2020. (Items 4-5) Applicant attributed his tax-filing
lapses to being an uninformed young student who did not believe the low earnings he
produced from his college internships required him to file federal and state income tax
returns. (Items 4-5) In his interrogatory response, he assured that (a) he made less than
the lowest tax bracket, and (b) his taxes were paid in excess through his withholdings,
leaving him with no monies owed the IRS. (Items 4-5)
To  date,  Applicant  has  not  taken  any  cognizable  actions  to  clarify  his  tax-filing
situation  with  either  the  IRS  or  his  state  of  residence.  Nor  has  he  provided  any
documentation  to  support  his  claims.  Without  more  information  from  Applicant  to
support  his  claims  that  he  was  not  required  federal  or  state  tax  returns  for  tax  years
2016 through 2020, favorable inferences cannot be drawn. At this time, Applicant’s tax-
filing lapses for these covered tax years remain unresolved.
