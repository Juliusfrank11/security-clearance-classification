Applicant  is  54  years  old,  has  never  married,  and  has  two  adult  children.  She
received her high school diploma in 1985 and a certificate from a law enforcement training
center in 1998. She attended college classes from 2002 to 2008, but was not awarded an
undergraduate  degree.  Since  2016  she  has  been  employed  as  a  litigation  analyst.
According to her e-QIP and the report summarizing her background interview, she has
been unemployed only for two brief periods since 2009; i.e., July to November 2014 and
October  2016  to  January  2017.  She  has  twice  been  granted  eligibility  for  a  security
clearance  at  the  top  secret  level,  first  in  1998  and  then  in  2012.  She  seeks  to  obtain
eligibility again in connection with her current employment. (Item 3 at 12-25, 28, 30-31,
37-39; Item 2 at 2; Item 17 at 2.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible
for  a  clearance  because  she  is  financially  overextended  and  therefore  potentially
unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
The SOR alleged that she has voluntarily filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief three times,
specifically in 1991 (1.a), 2010 (1.b), and 2018 (1.f). Her debts were discharged in each
case. The SOR also alleged that she filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief two times, in
January  2015  (1.c)  and  August  2015  (1.e).  In  both  cases  the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy
petitions were dismissed. The SOR alleged two tax debts owed to her state of residence
(State 1). For tax year (TY) 2010, she is alleged to owe approximately $8,497 (1.g), and
for TY 2012, she is alleged to owe approximately $7,696 (1.h). SOR 1.h also alleged that
State 1 has imposed a tax lien on Applicant for the delinquent taxes due for TY 2012. The
SOR further alleged that Applicant owes the U.S. Government about $14,022 in unpaid
taxes for TYs 2011 and 2013 (1.i). In her Answer Applicant admitted with explanations
each of these eight allegations. (Answer at 1.)
The SOR listed a ninth allegation stating that Applicant is indebted to State 1 for a
judgment entered against her in July 2015 in the amount of $14,770 for unemployment
benefits that she fraudulently received. (1.j) In her Answer, she denied that she committed
fraud in receiving unemployment benefits and claimed that she never received notice of
a hearing on State 1’s request for a judgment. (Item 2 at 1.)
The details of the nine SOR allegations are as follows:
1.a.   1991  Chapter  7  Bankruptcy  Petition  and  Discharge.  Applicant  filed  this
bankruptcy petition in July 1991 and her debts were discharged in December 1991. In her
Answer,  Applicant  explained  that  she  suffered  an  on-the-job  injury  in  1989  and  was
unable to work. In 1990 she became a single parent and experienced financial difficulties.
She filed for bankruptcy “to get a fresh start.” (Item 2 at 1; Item 4.)
1.b.  2010  Chapter 7  Bankruptcy  Petition  and  Discharge. This petition  was filed  in
January  2010. Applicant’s debts of $731,611.57  were discharged  in May  2010. She  was
employed  as a  security guard at that time. She  also owned  a  part-time  seasonal business,
which she  started  in 2003. In  her Answer, she  wrote  that a  bad  economy  forced  her to  file
this bankruptcy  petition  to  “salvage what I could  of  a  life  for myself  and  my  children.” She
further   explained   that   at  that   time   she   had   a   large   mortgage,   four  work  vehicles,   two
personal vehicles, a  warehouse,  and  two  young  children. (Item  2 at 1;  Item  3 at 40;  Item
5.)
1.c  January 2015 Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Petition. Applicant wrote in her answer
that she filed this petition “to stave off creditors because [she] had yet to fully recover from
the economic crash of 2009/2010.” She was also solely responsible for a child in college.
She claimed that she filed this petition due to “bad advice” of an attorney. In July 2015,
the  petition  was  dismissed  upon  Applicant’s  request  that  her  Chapter  13  plan  not  be
approved. (Item 2 at 1; Item 3 at 40; Item 6.)
1.d.  The SOR contains no allegation under this heading.
1.e.  August  2015  Chapter  13  Bankruptcy  Petition.  In  August  2015,  the  same
attorney filed a second Chapter 13 petition on behalf of Applicant. In September 2015,
Applicant filed an Amended plan under Chapter 13. Applicant submitted four amended
plans, and in July 2016 the bankruptcy court entered an order denying confirmation of
Applicant’s  plan  due  to  her  failure  to  fulfill  a  condition  for  confirmation.  The  case  was
dismissed in October 2016. In her Answer, Applicant wrote that both Chapter 13 petitions
were  filed  as  part  of  “a  plan  to  buy  me  time  until  I  was  eligible  to  file  a  Chap  7  [debt
discharge petition] again.” (Item 2 at 1; Item 7.)
1.f. 2018 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Petition and 2018 Discharge. Applicant filed a pro
se Chapter 7 petition in November 2018. She successfully discharged $138,058 of debts
in March 2019 with no distribution of any assets. The record reflects that Appellant was
employed  by  one  Government  contractor  as  a  Personnel  Security  Manager  starting  in
January 2017 until June 2018 and by a second Government contractor with the same title
in  June  2018.  The  most  recent  information  in  the  record  is  from  June  2018,  when  a
Triggered Enhanced Subject Interview of Applicant was conducted by investigators of the
Office of Personnel Management. In her November 2018 bankruptcy petition, she did not
list  any  employer,  but  provided  information  about  her  personal  business,  which  had  a
name similar to the business she claimed in her e-QIP she sold in December 2014. Her
petition reflects monthly income of $1,391. (Item 3 at 18-19; Item 8; Item 9 at 2, 8; Item
17 at 2.)
1.g  State  1  Unpaid  Taxes  Due  in  the  Amount  of  $8,497  for TY  2010.  Applicant
asserts in the Answer that she has resolved this tax debt with installment payments. She
provided  a  letter  from  State  1,  dated  March  14,  2022,  that  confirms  she  has  no
outstanding tax obligations to State 1. This debt is resolved. (Item 3 at 42; Item 15; Item
16.)
1.h.   State  1  Tax  Lien  Entered  against  Applicant  in  the  Amount  of  7,696  for  TY
2012. See 1.g, above. This debt is resolved. (Item 3 at Item 15; Item 16; Item 17 at 7.)
1.i. Federal Unpaid Taxes Due in the Amount of $14,022 for TYs 2011 and 2013.
Applicant admitted this debt in her Answer, but claimed that the debt has been resolved.
She  was  only  able  to  provide  limited  records  to  substantiate  her  claim  due  to  the
unavailability of records from the IRS for TY 2011 and earlier. She provided a tax account
transcript for TY 2013 that shows that the IRS wrote off her debt of $10,630 in April 2019.
The  TY  2013  tax  debt  is  resolved,  but  was  not  paid.  There  is  no  record  evidence  to
support her claim of resolution of the TY 2011 tax debt. (Item 14 at 4-5; Item 15 at 1,)
1.j.   July 9,  2015  State  1’s  Judgment  in  the Approximate  Amount  of  $14,770  for
Fraudulently Receiving Unemployment Benefits. This debt is not resolved. This judgment
was  entered  against  Applicant  by  the  Bankruptcy  court  as  part  of  her  Chapter  13
proceeding. State 1 filed an adversary proceeding against Applicant. In its Complaint to
Determine  Dischargeability  of  a  Debt,  State  1  alleged  that  Applicant  fraudulent
represented  that  she  was  eligible  and  remained  eligible  to  receive  unemployment
benefits. The requirement for eligibility was that Applicant be unemployed while receiving
benefits. State 1 alleged that while Applicant was receiving unemployment benefits, she
was  actually  employed  during  the  period  November  2011  through  July  2012.  In  her
Answer  Applicant  claimed  that  “she  had  no  idea  what  this  debt  was  about.”  She  also
claims that she never committed any fraud and was in the process of investigating the
matter  further.  I  note  that  Applicant  was  represented  by  counsel  in  her  bankruptcy
proceeding and the summary of filings in that proceeding reflect that State 1’s complaint
initiating  the  adversary  proceeding  was  filed  on  May  4,  2015.  This  judgment  is  not
resolved. (Item 6 at 3; Item 11; Item 12.)
Applicant  submitted  no  additional  documentation  or  information  concerning  her
debts  or  current  income.  Also,  she  provided  no  information  detailing  her  plans  for
resolving her past-due indebtedness or demonstrating other indicia of trustworthiness.
Paragraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)
2.a. The Government cross-alleged in this paragraph the SOR allegation set forth
in 1.j, above.
Applicant denied  committing  any  fraud  by  collecting  unemployment  benefits from
State  1  during  the  period  involved, November 2011  to  July  2012.  The  record evidence
supports  the   claim   of  State   1   that  Applicant   was  employed   during   those   months.  Her
claims  for  unemployment  benefits   during   that  period   were  not  valid   due   to   her
employment.   Applicant  wrote   in   her  Answer  that   that  she   made   an   inquiry   of   State   1
regarding  this issue  and  was waiting  to  hear back. She  provided  no  additional or  follow-
up information  or documentation. (Item 2  at 1.)
