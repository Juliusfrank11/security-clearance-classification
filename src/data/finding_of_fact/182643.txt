Applicant is a 55-year-old civilian of a defense contractor who seeks a.  security
clearance.  Admitted  facts  are  adopted  and  incorporated  by  reference.  Additional
findings of fact follow.
Background
Applicant  never  married  and  has  one  adult  child  (age  37)  from  a  prior
relationship,  and  a  granddaughter  who  resides  with  her  mother.  (GE  2;  Tr.  26)  She
earned  a  high  school  diploma  in  July  1981,  and  another  in  July  1983.  (GE  2)  She
reported no military service.
Since January 2018, Applicant has been employed by her current employer as a
security  officer.  (GEs  1-2)  She  has  held  part-time  jobs  since  2016  to  supplement  her
income  and  currently  earns  $27  an  hour  with  her  part-time  employers.  (Tr.  49-50)
Between  September  2006  and  December  2017,  she  worked  for  other  employers  in
security  officer  positions.  (GE  1;  Tr.  27-28)  She  has  held  a  security  clearance  since
August 2008 in the same building for her work as a security officer. (GE 2)
Applicant’s finances
Burdened   by   her  ongoing   efforts  to   help  her  family   at  home,  she   petitioned   for
Chapter 13  bankruptcy  relief  in May  2015. (GE  3; Tr. 24) In  her bankruptcy  petition,  she
scheduled  real property  totaling  $351,971  and  personal property  totaling  $41,234.  (GE
3)  On   the   liability   side   of   her  reported   accounts,  she   scheduled   secured   claims  of
$339,940   and   unsecured   non-priority   claims  of   $88,812.  (GE   3)  Unable  to   satisfy   the
revised  monthly  payments set by  the  bankruptcy  court, she  accepted  a  dismissal of  her
Chapter 13  petition in  April 2014. (GEs 1 and 3; Tr. 24, 33-34)
Bankruptcy  records  and  credit  reports  document  Applicant’s  (a)  petition  for
Chapter  13  bankruptcy  relief  and  (b)  her  accumulation  of  eight  delinquent  debts
between  2011  and  July  2022,  exceeding  $42,000.  (GEs  4-8)  Applicant  attributed  her
debt delinquencies to providing financial assistance to  her family members (i.e., to the
sister  of  her  child,  as well  as  to  funds  she  expended  to further her education.  (Tr. 25,
31-32)
Included  SOR  debts  are  as  follows:  1.b  (a  utility  debt  for  $439);  1.c  (a  federal
loan  for  $23,768),  1.d  (a  commercial  loan  for  $10,677);  1.e  (a  collateralized  car  loan
with $3,375 in past due payments on an overall balance of $48,234); 1.f (a credit card
debt for $2,356); 1.g (a utility debt for $1,395); 1.h (a medical debt for $891); and 1.i (a
consumer debt for $242). (GEs 3-8) These debts are listed in Applicant’s credit reports
as  unresolved  and  outstanding.  (GEs  4-8)  Shortly  after  her  Chapter  13  bankruptcy
petition was dismissed, Applicant retained a credit repairing firm to help her ensure that
her reported delinquent debts  were accurate. (Tr. 34) Once these reported debts were
verified, she contacted the creditors herself to try to make settlement arrangements with
the identified creditors. (Tr. 34-35)
Applicant  was  able  to make  contact  with  her SOR  creditors.  However,  she  was
only successful in documenting her payoffs of creditors covered by SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d.
(AEs  A-D;  Tr.  37-39)  These  documented  payoffs  for  reduced  amounts  covered  over
$34,000  of  the  total  debt  amounts  listed  in  the  SOR  and  represent  two  of  her  largest
identify  and  work  out  payment
debts.  (AEs  A-D)  Her  post-hearing  efforts  to
arrangements  with  her  remaining  creditors  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.e-1.i),  while  successful
according  to  Applicant,  are  not  documented  with  payoffs  or  payments.  (Tr.  39-44)
Among Applicant’s major alleged SOR debts that are not documented with payments or
payment plans is an  account with  a  car retailer covered  by  SOR ¶  1.e  (a car loan  for the
purchase of a  luxury  vehicle) with  a  past due  amount  owing  on a $48,234  loan  balance).
Credit records report that she  last made  a  payment on  this account in June  2015. (GEs
7-8) Applicant’s claims that she has made  more recent payments and is current with this
loan  account are not documented  and  cannot be  accepted  without verification. (Tr. 40-
42)
Promising at hearing to provide post-hearing documentation of the current status
of  her  SOR  ¶  1.e  account,  Applicant  did  not  provide  any  updated  verification  of  the
current  status  of  the  account,  citing  her  “inability  to  get  more  information  on  the
accounts  in  question.”  (AE  B)  Based  on  available  information,  Applicant’s  loan
deficiency  with  her  car  loan  remains  unpaid  and  unresolved.  Applicant’s  remaining
debts  covered  by  the  SOR  (1.b  and  1.e-1.i)  remain  unpaid  and  unresolved  as  well.
While  most  of  these  debts  have  fallen  off  of  her  most  recent  credit  reports  (notably
debts  covered  by  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.e-1.i),  age  (and  not  payment)  of  the  debts  is
inferentially the most likely reason for their more recent disappearance from Applicant’s
credit  reports.  Without  more  documented  verification  clarification  from  Applicant,
favorable inferences of voluntary, good-faith resolution of these debts cannot be drawn.
One  of  the  debts  Applicant  addressed  is  a  non-SOR  debt  covering  a  hospital
debt  was  dismissed  by  a  court  presiding  over  the  creditor’s  complaint.  (AE  E)  While
Applicant  was  successful  in  selling  her  home,  she  used  the  proceeds  of  the  sale
($520,000) to finance her new house and set aside no funds to address her delinquent
debts. (Tr. 42-43)
