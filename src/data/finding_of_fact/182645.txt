In his answer, Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations (¶¶ 1.a-1.h and 2.a). His
admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. Based on my review of the pleadings,
evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is 37 years old. He was married in 2021. He has a minor son and step-
son with his wife and an adult daughter from a prior relationship. He has taken college
courses, but has not earned a degree. He has worked as a material handler for a defense
contractor since 2009. He stated that he previously held a security clearance, but it is no
longer active. (Tr. 18-20; GE 1)
Applicant  cited  different  reasons  for  his financial  problems  and  the  debts  in  the
SOR. He reported that a few years after his daughter was born, he was required to pay
monthly child support and part of her daycare expenses, which impacted his finances. He
paid child support between about 2004 and 2020, and claimed that in 2014 it increased
to about $1,000 monthly for the last five years. (Tr. 29-32, 68-69)
Applicant reported that for a time he was living beyond his means, had maxed out
his credit cards, and was getting behind on his bills. In the 2013-2014 timeframe, he was
suspended from work without pay on a few occasions, for mistakes he made at work. In
about October 2020, his girlfriend (now his wife) lost her job, and he was the sole income
earner in their household for about a year, until 2021. (Tr. 22, 61-62)
Under Guideline F, the original SOR alleges eight delinquent debts, including five
student loans totaling about $15,856, and three delinquent consumer debts totaling about
$4,981. Under Guideline E, the SOR also alleges that Applicant falsified material facts on
his 2018 SCA. The status of the allegations is as follows:
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c,  1.d, and 1.g are student loans in collection totaling $13,308, and
¶ 1.e is a student loan that has been charged off for $2,548. Applicant attended college
classes from about 2010-2013. He stated that after finishing his courses, he was unable
to afford the loan payments. He reported that he has never made any payments on these
loans. He claimed that he requested a payment plan a couple of times, but never followed
through  with  payments.  These  student  loans  are  unresolved.  In  a  post  hearing
submission, he provided payoff and settlement information for a debt with a student loan
creditor that was not alleged in the SOR. He did not provide evidence showing that he
has made payments to resolve this other student loan. (Tr. 20-22, 35-38, 41, 63-64; GE
2, 4, 5)
SOR ¶  1.b is an auto loan placed for collection for $4,527. Applicant stated that
the vehicle was totaled in an accident in 2020. After the accident, he never reached out
to the insurance company or the lender to resolve this debt. This debt remains unpaid.
(Tr. 20-21, 38-40, 67-68; GE 4, 5).
SOR ¶  1.f  is a credit card placed for collection for $302.  It has been delinquent
since about 2013. Applicant stated that he has no recollection if it was ever paid, and he
failed to provide any documentation showing that it has been resolved. (Tr. 22, 40-41; GE
4, 5)
SOR ¶ 1.h is a gym membership account placed for collection for $152. Applicant
stated  that  he  was  unable  to  handle  the  expense  after  joining.  He  stated  that  he  last
reached out to the creditor in 2017, and has not taken any action since then. This debt is
remains unpaid. (Tr. 22, 41-42; GE 5)
SOR  ¶   1.i   is an unpaid  federal income tax debt for $22,926 for tax years 2014,
2015, and 2021. The debt is split almost evenly for each tax year. Applicant stated that
he was traveling to another state for work for a few weeks in 2015 and 2016 when his
2014  and  2015  tax  returns  needed  to  be  filed.  He  reported  that  he  was  living  with  his
mother at the time, and that she was supposed to file the returns for him while he was on
travel. She did not file the returns, and he did not confirm the filings with her. He stated
that he learned that these two tax returns had not been filed and that he owed money for
these years in 2016 or 2017. He learned that he owed money for his 2021 taxes the day
prior to the hearing, when he checked his IRS account balance. He reported that his 2014
and 2015 tax returns are still unfiled, and that he has no payment arrangement with the
IRS to resolve the debt. (Tr. 24-29, 42-44, 64-67; AE B)
SOR ¶  2.a alleges that Applicant falsified material facts on his 2018 SCA by failing
to report his financial delinquencies involving routine accounts. His narrative in his SOR
answer and testimony were the same. He said that his failure to report the debts was not
intentional, because he was rushing to complete his SCA. He claimed that since he works
in  the  tool  room,  he  was  repeatedly  interrupted  while  completing  his  SCA.  He  also
asserted  that  he  read  the  questions  too  fast  and  answered  the  questions  without
understanding  them.  He  reported  some  of  his  delinquent  debts  in  his  background
interview with a government investigator before being confronted with his other debts. (Tr.
11-12, 23, 56-68; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  reported  that  he  earns  about  $43  an  hour,  which  has  increased  from
about $20 an hour when he started in 2009. He and his wife purchased a home in about
2019, and their monthly mortgage is about $2,000. They do not have a written budget,
and he failed to provide any other information about their monthly income and expenses.
He reported that they do not have any funds in their joint savings account, but that he has
about $80,000 in his 401K retirement account. He has not had credit counseling. His wife
handles their finances, and has recently started a credit repair business. He reported that
she has personal debt that she is trying to address as well. (Tr. 45-49, 62)
