Applicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  2015.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance  for  more  than  35
years. He has a  bachelor’s degree  that he earned 1982. He is divorced  with two adult
children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 10, 15-17; GE 1, 2)
Applicant has a history of marijuana use, from about 1978 to 1982 while he was
in college; once in December 2001 to January 2002 while he held a security clearance;
and again in 2017 and 2018, while holding a security clearance. His marijuana and drug
paraphernalia  possession  resulted  in  several  charges.  He  was  cited  in  1979  for
possession  of  marijuana;  in  January  2002  for  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia;  in
September  2017  for  possession  of  marijuana  and  drug  paraphernalia;  and  in  January
2018  for  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia.  (Tr.  at  15,  18-19,  26,  55-56;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 6, 7, 9)
Applicant  made  a  signed  statement  as  part  of  his  background  investigation  in
September  1989.  He  discussed  his  1979  citation  for  possession  of  marijuana.  He
admitted that he possessed marijuana in 1979. He wrote that he first smoked marijuana
in April or May 1979 at a party. He stated that he smoked marijuana two to three times
from  April  or  May  1979  until  the  June  1979  arrest.  He  falsely  stated  that  he  had  not
used marijuana after the arrest in June 1979.1  He stated that he had no intention to use
marijuana in the future. (Tr. at 55-58; GE 9)
Applicant  was  cited  in  January  2002  for  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia.  He
denies  that  he  possessed  drug  paraphernalia.  He  asserted  that  the  pipe  that  was
allegedly used  to  smoke  marijuana  was  actually a  tobacco  pipe  and  was  only used  to
smoke tobacco. He stated that it was proven to be tobacco, and he was found not guilty
of the charge. (Tr. at 22, 36-37, 40; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant made a signed statement in May 2002. He admitted his marijuana use
from 1978 to 1982 while attending college. He also admitted to using marijuana on one
occasion in December 2001 or January 2002, while employed by a defense contractor
and  holding a  security  clearance.  He  said  he  used  it at  his home with  a  named friend
from  his  home  state  who  was  visiting.  He  stated  that  he  had  no  intention  to  use
marijuana  in  the  future.  He  essentially  stated  the  same  facts  in  a  signed  statement  in
March 2005. In spite of those two statements, Applicant testified at his hearing that he
did not recall using marijuana in 2001 to 2002.  (Tr. at 19-20, 23-26, 40-41; Applicant’s
response  to  SOR;  GE  6,  7)  I  did  not  find  his  testimony  credible.  I  find  by  substantial
evidence2  that he used marijuana while holding a security clearance in about December
2001 or January 2002.
1 Any adverse matter that  was not alleged  in the SOR  will not be used for disqualification  purposes. It may
be  considered when  assessing  Applicant’s  credibility, in the  application  of  mitigating  conditions, and in the
whole-person  analysis.
2  Substantial  evidence  is  “such  relevant  evidence  as  a  reasonable  mind  might  accept  as  adequate  to
support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.” See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No.
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
September  2015.  He  reported  that  he  was  fired  from  his  employment  in  June  2015
because  of  “Misunderstanding  of  company  policy.” He  provided  a  detailed  explanation
under other questions. He reported his 1979 citation for possession of marijuana, but he
did not report his January 2002 citation for possession of drug paraphernalia. He denied
that  he  “EVER  illegally  used  or  otherwise  been  involved  with  a  drug  or  controlled
substance while possessing a security clearance other than previously listed.” (GE 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  June  2017.  He
discussed  his  2015  job  termination.  He  stated  that  the  1979  marijuana  possession
charge was discussed previously, and there were no other developments to report. (GE

Applicant  was  stopped  for  a  traffic  citation  in  September  2017.  The  deputy
noticed the smell of unburnt marijuana and saw something suspicious in the cup holder.
Applicant stated that it was an old pipe that he used to smoke tobacco. When he was
handed  the  pipe,  the  deputy  saw  burnt  marijuana  residue,  and  it  smelled  like  burnt
marijuana.  Applicant  admitted  to  smoking  “bud”  that  day.  The  deputy  also  found  two
plastic  bags  in  the  vehicle  with  just  over  two  grams  of  marijuana.  Applicant  was  cited
with possession of marijuana. (Tr. at 15, 26, 30-31; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2,
3, 13, 15)
Applicant  received  a  deferred  adjudication  for  the  offense.  He  was  required  to
pay a fine and fees, and he was required to attend a personal behavior class. (Tr. at 15,
16, 38-39; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 15)
Applicant held a security clearance at the time. He  self-reported the charge and
its disposition to his security officer in November 2017. He indicated that he purchased
the  marijuana  and  smoked  it  in  a  state  where  it  was  legal  under  state  law.  He
transported it to his state, where it was not legal under state law. He falsely stated that
he had not used illegal drugs on any other occasions since 1979. (Tr. at 15, 26; GE 3,

Applicant was going through airport security in his home state in January 2018. A
small knife and a pipe with marijuana residue was found after his carry-on bag was x-
rayed. The small metal pipe was wrapped in a napkin in a ziplock bag inside a toiletry
bag. Airport police were notified.  Applicant admitted to the  police officer that the carry-
on bag and the ziplock bag was his. The officer asked him what was in the ziplock bag
to which Applicant replied it was “a small pipe that he had forgotten that was in his bag.”
He  also  stated  that  he  smoked  tobacco.  The  police  officer  examined  the  pipe  and
determined  based  on  his  experience  that  the  residue  was  burnt  marijuana.  Applicant
17-04166   at  3  (App.  Bd.  Mar.  21,  2019)   (citing   Directive  ¶   E3.1.32.1).   “This   is   something   less   than  the
weight  of   the   evidence,  and   the  possibility   of   drawing   two  inconsistent  conclusions   from   the   evidence
does  not prevent [a Judge’s] finding  from  being  supported by   substantial   evidence.”  Consolo v. Federal
Maritime  Comm’n,  383  U.S. 607,  620 (1966).  “Substantial  evidence” is  “more than  a  scintilla  but  less  than
a preponderance.”  See v. Washington  Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36  F.3d  375, 380  (4th  Cir. 1994);  ISCR
Case No.  04-07187  at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2006).
then   admitted   that  he   smoked   marijuana,  and   that  the   last   time   he   smoked   marijuana
with the pipe was the  previous month on Christmas.  (Tr. at 31-39; GE 14)
Applicant was cited with possession of drug paraphernalia, provided a court date,
and  permitted  to  board  his flight.  Applicant  was  found  not  guilty  of  the  charge  in  April
2019. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 14)
Applicant  testified   that   he   borrowed   the   carry-on   bag   from   his  son,  and   he   was
unaware that the  pipe  was in the  bag. He stated  that he  never asked  his son  about  the
pipe  because  he  did not want to  worry his son.  He denied  telling  the  police  officer  that
he  used  the  pipe  to  smoke  marijuana.   (Tr.  at 31-39; Applicant’s response   to   SOR;   GE
14) I did not find his testimony credible.  I find that the incident happened substantially as
reported in the  police report of the incident.
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  background  investigator  in  October  2018  about
the 2017 and 2018 citations and his marijuana use. He admitted that he used marijuana
in  college  from  1978  to  1983,  but  he  stated  that  he  did  not  use  it  again  until  he
possessed and used marijuana in July 2017. He discussed his September 2017 charge
for  marijuana  possession.  He  used  marijuana  three  or  four  days  while  he  was  on
vacation  in  July  2017,  and  again  in  September  2017.  He  stated  those  were  the  only
times he used drugs while holding a security clearance. He stated that he had not used
marijuana at any other time, and he did not intend to use it in the future as it could derail
his career. (GE 2)
Applicant  discussed  the  January  2018  citation  from  the  airport  with  the
investigator. He stated that the pipe was not his, and he did not know how it got in his
bag. He stated that it could belong to one of his children. (GE 2)
Applicant  denied  that  he  provided  false  information  during  the  interview.  He
stated that he told the truth and that it was not his pipe that was found at the airport. (Tr.
at 31-39; Applicant’s response to SOR) As indicated above, I did not find him credible. I
find  that  he  lied  to  the  investigator,  and  he  provided  additional false  statements  in  the
SOR response and during his hearing testimony.
Applicant  also has a  history of  workplace  issues.  An  incident  report  was  issued
by  an  employer  in  February  1997  because  Applicant  “did  not  comply  with  company
policy  of  paying  his  [company]  credit  card  in  a  timely  manner  and  by  using  his  credit
card  for  personal  use.”  He  stated  that  he  paid  the  balance  off  in  full,  and  no  further
action  was  required.  He  went  to  work  for  another  defense  contractor  in  August  1997,
where  he  worked  until  he  was  terminated  in  May  2015  for  unauthorized  use  of  an
employer-issued credit card. (Tr. at 45-50; GE 6, 8, 10, 16)
In 2001, Applicant’s employer counseled him for charging personal rental cars to
the  company’s  corporate  credit  card  without  proper  authority,  for  having  an  unpaid
balance  on  a  corporate  credit  card,  and  for  not  repaying  a  cash  advance  from  the
company.  The  company  assisted  him  in  resolving  the  matter.  He  was  suspended
without  pay  for  a  week.  He  was  “placed  on  permanent  probation  for  any  similar
violations,” with  the  warning  that “[s]hould similar violations occur he  will  be  immediately
terminated.”  (Tr. at 50;  GE 6, 11)
Applicant was terminated in May 2015 for misuse of a company credit card. He
stated that he was having financial difficulties, and he used the company credit card for
“expenses  that  involved  transportation  to  work  and  some  expenses  on  an  approved
trip.” He asserted that it was a “[m]isundstanding of company policy,” and that he “never
falsified  any  trip  reports  and  paid  the  balance  of  the  credit  card.”  (Tr.  at  44,  50-55;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 12, 16)
Applicant  submitted  documents  and  letters  attesting  to  his  excellent  job
performance  and  ethical  standards.  He  is  praised  for  his  work  ethic  and  sensitive
handling of classified information. (Applicant’s response to SOR)
