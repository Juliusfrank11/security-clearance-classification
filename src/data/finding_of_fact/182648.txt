Personal Conduct
The SOR lists five allegations under this concern. SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1b allege that
Applicant  falsified  his  January  9,  2013  SF-86  and  his  January  22,  2015  SF-86,
respectively; SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d allege terminations from employment for unsatisfactory
performance in October 2012 and January 2014, respectively; and SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a
termination  from  employment  for  violating  his  employer’s  workplace  and  sexual
harassment policy in May 2017.
These allegations are established by his January 9, 2013 SF-86; his January 26,
2015 SF-86; his Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigation conducted from
January 11, 2016 to February 18, 2016, to include his January 14, 2016 OPM Personal
Subject  Interview  (PSI);  his  May  6,  2020  DOHA  Response  to  Interrogatories;  a  DISS
CATS  Incident  Report  printed  July  8,  2021;  two  former  Government  contractor
employment  records;  and  his  March  16,  2021  SOR  Answer.  (GE  1-7;  SOR  Answer)
These SOR allegations are summarized as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a – Alleged that Applicant falsified material facts on his January 9, 2013
SF-86 when queried whether in the last seven years he had consulted with a health care
professional regarding an  emotional or mental health  condition  or was  hospitalized  for
such a condition. The question instructed applicants to answer ‘No’ if the counseling was
for any of the following reasons and was not court-ordered: strictly marital, family, grief
not related to violence by applicant, or  strictly related to adjustments from service in a
military combat environment. Applicant answered ‘No’ and is alleged to have deliberately
failed to disclose that he received mental health treatment from about 2001 to January
2013. Applicant denied this allegation. (SOR Answer; Tr. 29-30; AE K)
Applicant  explained  in  his  SOR  Answer,  “I  did  not  go  back  to  2001,  12  years,
because the question states seven (7) years and seven (7) years from 2013 is 2006. I
only  went  back  to  2006  and  do  not  understand  why  my  treatment  prior  to  2006  was
introduced during this investigation, considering the question’s requirement is seven (7)
years.  Very  importantly,  my  counseling  was  for  my  marriage,  family  matters  and  life
situations.”  (SOR  Answer)  Applicant’s  hearing  testimony  was  consistent  with  his  SOR
Answer and his January 14, 2016 OPM PSI. He recounted the counseling he has had
throughout the years. (Tr. 33-41, 84-86; SOR Answer)
SOR ¶ 1.b - Alleged that Applicant falsified material facts on his January 22, 2015
SF-86 when queried whether in the last seven years he had consulted with a health care
professional regarding an  emotional or mental health  condition  or was  hospitalized  for
such a condition. The question instructed applicants to answer ‘No’ if the counseling was
for any of the following reasons and was not court-ordered: strictly marital, family, grief
not related to violence by applicant, or strictly related to adjustments from service in the
military combat environment. Applicant answered ‘No’ and is alleged to have deliberately
failed to disclose that he received mental health treatment from about 2001 to January
2013. Applicant denied this allegation. (SOR Answer; Tr. 29-30; AE L)
Applicant  explained  in  his  SOR  Answer,  “I  did  not  go  back  to  2001,  12  years,
because  seven  (7)  years  from  2015  is  2008.  I  only  went  back  to  2008  and  do  not
understand  why  my  treatment  prior  to  2008  was  introduced  during  this  investigation,
considering  the  question’s  requirement  is  seven  (7)  years.  Very  importantly,  my
counseling was for my marriage, family matters and life situations. I used the January 9,
2013 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) as a guide for my
January 22, 2015, since there was no negative feedback from the 2013 e-QIP. I am proud
of the counseling I have completed throughout the years; it has helped my marriage and
life greatly knowing I am not the only person with personal issues that can be dealt with
effectively with counseling.” (SOR Answer) Applicant’s hearing testimony was consistent
with his SOR Answer. He recounted the counseling he has had throughout the years. (Tr.
33-41, 84-86)
Applicant’s counsel introduced a copy of the most recent version of the November
2016 SF-86 noting that the section dealing with psychological and emotional health has
been rewritten and no longer asks the question that Applicant was accused of falsifying
on his 2013 and 2015 SF-86s. (Tr. 41-44; AE M)
SOR ¶ 1.c – Alleged that Applicant was terminated from his defense contractor’s
employment  in  October  2012  for  unsatisfactory  performance.  Applicant  admitted  this
allegation. (SOR Answer; Tr. 29-30)
Applicant  explained  in  his  SOR  Answer  that  the  Government  Customer  (Lead)
(GCL)  “micromanaged”  him  from  the  onset  of  his  employment  and  complained  to  his
supervisor about “small nonjob related issues.” He stated that the GCL would “bad mouth”
Government  contractors  to  other  Government  employees  behind  the  Government
contractors back. Applicant provided specific examples of how the GCL made his work
environment very difficult and how Applicant felt like he was in a no-win situation. (SOR
Answer) He self-reported this termination on his January 9, 2013 and January 26, 2015
SF-86s. Applicant’s hearing  testimony was consistent with his SF-86s, his January 14,
2016 OPM PSI and his SOR Answer. (Tr. 44-47, 87-90; GE 1, GE 2)
SOR ¶ 1.d – Alleged that Applicant resigned in lieu of termination from his defense
contractor’s  employment  in  January  2014  for  unsatisfactory  performance.  Applicant
admitted this allegation. (SOR Answer; Tr. 29-30)
Applicant explained in his SOR Answer that he resigned in lieu of termination on
the advice of one of his supervisors. The supervisor explained to Applicant that it “would
look  better”  if  he  resigned  instead  of  being  terminated.  Applicant  noted  that  this
Government  contractor  sponsored  him  for  a  Top  Secret  clearance  and  rated  his
performance  from  January  7,  2013  to  September  30,  2013  “As  Expected  (Solid
Performer)” noting in the comments section “[Applicant] is a valuable asset to the team,
company  and  customer.”  Applicant  stated  that  he  never received  counseling  regarding
his performance nor did he receive any customer complaints. However, he did have an
ongoing “personality conflict” with a female team member, who Applicant stated sexually
harassed him and performed a lap dance on a male coworker in the conference room in
front of a program manager. He provided examples of the sexual harassment. Applicant
also filed an online complaint with his state department of fair employment and housing
against the Government contractor and the female coworker; however, the agency made
a finding of “unfounded.” He opined that he was terminated due to the personality conflict
he  had  with  the female  coworker, and  stated  that he  knows his performance  was “well
received by co-workers, supervisors, and customers.” After he was terminated, his senior
line manager wrote a “glowing” letter of recommendation for him. (AE C) (SOR Answer;
Tr. 97-100)
Applicant’s hearing testimony was consistent with his January 14, 2016 OPM PSI
and his SOR Answer. (SOR Answer; Tr. 90-94; GE 2) Applicant’s counsel introduced a
copy of Applicant’s performance evaluation from January 2013 to September 2013, which
corroborated Applicant’s SOR Answer and discussed his performance in detail, with all
comments  being  favorable.  The  source  document  that  provides  the  basis  for  this
allegation is a one-page Government contractor Personnel Action Form that states as,
“Termination Type: Voluntary,” and “Reason: Mutual Agreement.” Applicant testified that
his  termination  was  not  by  mutual  agreement,  but  rather  it  was  as  stated  in  his  SOR
Answer.  His  supervisor  advised  him  that  it  would  be  better  to  resign  versus  being
terminated. (Tr. 47-55; AE B)
SOR ¶ 1.e – Alleged that Applicant was terminated from his defense contractor’s
employment  in  May  2017  for  violation  of  the  firm’s  workplace  and  sexual  harassment
policy. Applicant admitted this allegation. (SOR Answer; Tr. 29-30)
tap  on  a  young
Applicant explained in his SOR Answer that this was an “over blown situation, all
that  occurred  was  a
lady’s  shoulder  to  get  her  attention.”
He  added  that  he  “did  not  linger,  grab,  or  squeeze.”  Applicant  stated  that  he  and  the
woman  “worked  well  together and  never had  any issues in  the  workplace.” The  sexual
harassment complaint came as “a big surprise” to him, and Applicant assumed that the
situation would be resolved through counseling and additional training. Applicant opined
that the woman was a Government employee and his Government contractor did not want
to jeopardize losing the contract. Applicant stated his performance with this Government
contractor was never an issue. He noted that he received an overall rating as “Superior
Contributor” on his 2015 performance evaluation and his manager gave him “all positive
remarks” on 2016 performance evaluation. (AE D, AE E) (SOR Answer)
Applicant’s  hearing  testimony  was  consistent  with  his  SOR  Answer  and  his
January  14,  2016  OPM  PSI.  (SOR  Answer;  Tr.  94-97,  104-105;  GE  2)  The  source
documents that provide the basis for this allegation is a four-page Government contractor
document and a May 8, 2017 letter that states, “This termination is due to violation of the
firm’s Workplace and Sexual Harassment Policy;” and a three-page DISS CATS Incident
Report printed on July 8, 2021. The documents do not elaborate on the underlying facts
that  led  to  Applicant’s  terminations.  The  Incident  Report  also  states  that  Applicant
received a “Favorable” Top Secret Eligibility Level determination on June 21, 2017 and
same document reported that the Government contractor terminated him 40 days prior
on  May  8,  2017.  Applicant  acknowledged  that  the  woman  in  question  interpreted  his
tapping  her on  the  shoulder as a  “harassing  gesture” and  he  accepts responsibility  for
that. (Tr. 55-64; GE 5, GE 6)
Applicant submitted two performance evaluations from this employer, covering the
period January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015, and January 1, 2016 to December 31,
2016. Both evaluations are very favorable. Applicant has learned from this incident that,
“Anybody can  perceive  anything the  way they feel and  the way that want to  perceive  it
and the way they want to interpret it. So I ensure that I do not do anything that could be
interpreted as hostile or harassing. I maintain a very businesslike demeanor while I’m at
work talking to coworkers, whether they’re male or female.” (Tr. 64-67; AE D, AE E)
Government Exhibit 8  is a  July  16, 2019  six-page  DOD CAF-initiated  evaluation
conducted   by   a   clinical  psychologist  to   “determine   whether  [Applicant’s]  reliability   or
judgment present a  threat to  him  handling  classified  information  based  upon  the  belief
that he  may  have  a  condition  or diagnosis which if  left untreated, may  disqualify  him  from
being  eligible  to  hold a  clearance.” Attached  to  the  evaluation  is the  clinical psychologist’s
four-page   resume.   The   evaluation   recounts   that  every   attempt  by   the   psychologist  to
contact  any   of   the   individuals   who   made   complaints  about  the   Applicant  or individuals
involved with his terminations was unsuccessful. (Tr. 67-69; GE 8,  GE 9)
The evaluation was comprehensive to include history and methodology; however,
only pertinent portions follow. The Diagnosis Impression states in part, “Clinical interview
and  the  results  of  psychological  testing  indicates  that  the  [Applicant]  is  not  currently
experiencing  any  significant  psychological  symptoms  which  would  disqualify  him  from
being able to hold a security clearance. Additionally, the Prognosis section states in part,
“It  is  the  opinion  of  the  undersigned  provider  that  the  [Applicant]  does  not  possess  an
underlying psychological defect which would inherently impair his judgment, reliability, or
trustworthiness.”  Lastly, referring to Applicant’s personality responses, the psychologist
stated, “While these  behaviors should be  carefully considered, they do  not constitute a
psychological defect or condition which impairs the [Applicant’s] judgment, reliability, or
trustworthiness to safeguard or handle sensitive information.” (Tr. 69-72; GE 8, GE 9)
Applicant has sought counseling  following  his May  2017  termination  for violating
his firm’s   workplace   and   sexual harassment   policy. The   counseling   was  to   address,   in
part, the  impact that termination  and  violation  of  company  policy  had  on  himself  and  his
marriage. Among  the  lessons  Applicant  said  he  learned  from  that  counseling  was that  he
may   not  have   thought  his   conduct   was  “anything   bad,”   but  the   offended   party   “can
interpret  it  and   think  that  way   and   that’s  their   right.”  Applicant  learned   not  to   touch   or
compliment and  maintain professionalism  within the  workplace. Applicant’s wife  is aware
of  the  details surrounding  his recent termination  and  is supportive, adding  that she  is of
the  opinion that the complaining woman “went overboard.” (Tr. 72-74)
Applicant continues to participate in counseling for mild depression, as well as for
marriage  enrichment,  and  to  assist  him  to  maintain  a  professional  attitude  in  the  work
place. He mentors new employees on how to avoid the mistakes he made in the past.
(Tr. 75, 83, 101-102, 107-108)
Character Evidence
Applicant’s  DD-214  documents  his  20-year  Navy  career  to  include  training,
qualifications, and numerous awards and decorations. His personal awards include the
Navy  and  Marine  Corps  Commendation  Medal  and  two  Navy  and  Marine  Corps
Achievement Medals. (AE A) Applicant submitted two photographs, the first is of him at a
Labrador and dog rescue organization raffle. He volunteers in support of various aspects
of that organization. The second is of him playing Santa Claus at a German Shepherd
rescue organization picnic. He also volunteers in various aspects of that organization and
adopted two dogs from them. (Tr. 75-77; AE F) Several performance evaluations have
already been discussed, supra. Applicant’s evaluations from his Government contractor
employers from 2017 to 2020 were favorable. (Tr. 77, 80; AE H – J) Applicant described
his current performance since starting with his current Government contractor in August
2021 as “Great. No Problem.” (Tr. 77)
Applicant submitted one reference letter dated January 13, 2014 from his former
senior line manager from the Government contractor that terminated him in January 2014
for  unsatisfactory  performance.  In  short,  his  former  senior  line  manager  wrote  a  very
favorable assessment of Applicant and his work performance. He concluded by saying,
“[Applicant]  has  my  personal  recommendation  for  employment.  My  team’s  loss  will  be
your company’s gain.” (AE C)
When  asked  if  there was anything  he  would like  to  say  in closing, Applicant stated,
“I feel that I am  trustworthy. I should be  able to  continue  to  work with  classified  information.
Had  a  couple of bumps on  the  road  on  the  way  through, but I’ve  had  a  clearance  for 37
years. And  I just feel that I deserve  to  keep  my  clearance. I’m  a  hard worker. I respect
people.  I respect my  bosses. I respect people  I work with. I think that I should maintain
my  clearance. That’s all  I can  really  say.” (Tr. 78)  Applicant  committed  to  answering  SF-
86s truthfully, maintaining  professionalism  in the  workplace,  and  to  bring  any  challenging
work-related interpersonal issues to  the human resources department. (Tr. 79)
