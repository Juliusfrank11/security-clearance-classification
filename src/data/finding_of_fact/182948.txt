Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a government contractor. She has worked
for her current employer since about March 2021. She worked for another government
contractor  from  2016  until  2019  and  another  from  2019  until  she  started  her  current
employment. She was awarded a high school diploma in 2007 and attended college for
several  years  without  earning  an  undergraduate  degree.  She  was  married  from  2015
until  her  divorce  in  July  2019.  She  currently  resides  with  a  cohabitant.  She  has  no
children. (Tr. 18-20; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant’s  six  delinquent  debts  totaling  approximately
$39,000.  These  delinquencies  are  a  federal  student  loan  (SOR  ¶  1.a),  a  credit-card
account (SOR ¶ 1.b), and four medical debts  (SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.f). Approximately
$32,000 of the delinquent debt in the SOR is for a student loan. Applicant admitted all of
the SOR allegations with additional comment. Her admissions are adopted as findings
of  fact.  The  SOR  allegations  are  established  through  Applicant’s  admissions  and  the
Government’s evidence. (Answer; GE 1-4)
Applicant  claimed  her  financial  issues  resulted  from  underemployment  and
unemployment.  She  quit  a  job  to  provide  assistance  to  an  ill  family  member  who
required  care.  She  went  through  a  divorce  in  2019.  She  and  her  boyfriend  recently
allowed her boyfriend’s sibling to move in with them until he can “get back on his feet.”
She claimed that she only has enough income to pay one delinquent bill at a time. She
acknowledged  that  she  did  not  address  her federal  student  loan  appropriately  when  it
first  became  due  in  about  2013  because  she  was  immature.  (Tr.  26,  29,  33,  35,  37;
Answer; GE 1)
Applicant’s  take-home  pay  is  about  $2,300  per  month.  She  is  paid  hourly  and
earns $22.15 per hour. From March 2019 until March 2021, she earned between $14.25
and $18 per hour. Her boyfriend, who resides with her, shares with household income
and expenses. His take-home pay is about $2,700 per month. Applicant has $5,000 in a
retirement  account.  She  pays  $450  per  month  in  rent.  She  purchased  a  new  Honda
crossover  SUV  in  2020  for  $25,000.  She  pays  $629  per  month  on  that  car  note.  Her
latest monthly electric  bill  was  $430,  and  she  pays  $160  per month for her cell phone
and  internet.  Her  boyfriend  pays  $90  per  month  for  child  support  and  has  a  $400
monthly car payment.  He  also  pays  $80  to  $90  per month  for  insurance.  She  claimed
that at the end of the month, after paying all of her expenses, she has about $100 left
over for savings. (Tr. 20-21, 26-29, 31, 43-45)
In about April 2021, Applicant inherited about $12,000 from her late grandmother.
In  about  June  2021,  she  inherited  another  $7,000  for  a  total  inheritance  of  about
$19,000. Applicant plans to use this inheritance to pay for a down payment on a house.
However, there is no legal impediment to her using this inheritance for other purposes.
As  a  result of  additional deposits  that  Applicant  and her boyfriend have  made  into  the
checking  account  containing  the  inheritance,  this  account  holds  a  balance  of  about
$23,000. (Tr. 22-25, 29-30).
The delinquent federal student loan in the amount of $32,351 listed in SOR ¶ 1.a
has not been resolved. The payments on  this debt became due in 2013, about a year
after Applicant stopped attending college. She did not make any payment on this debt
or attempt to contact the creditor until about 2015. In 2015, she worked with a company
not affiliated with the Federal Government, and made payments of $100 per month for a
year. After that year, in about 2016, this company asked her to make a $1,600 payment
to  continue with  their program,  which  she could not afford. She therefore discontinued
making  payments  and  did  not  attempt  to  remedy  her  delinquency  on  this  debt  until
about  2018.  In  2018,  she  contacted  the  same  company,  but  they  still  wanted  a  down
payment that was more than she could afford. As of the hearing, she had yet to contact
the  Department  of  Education  to  try  to  resolve  her  delinquency.  (Tr.  32-36,  40-41;
Answer; GE 1-4; AE A)
In  her  post-hearing  document  submission,  Applicant  provided  an  undated
document  from  the  Department  of  Education  reflecting  that  her  student  loans  are  not
currently  eligible  for  forgiveness  or  an  income-driven  repayment  plan.  I  have  taken
administrative  notice  that  all  federal  student  loans  were  eligible  for  placement  in  a
deferment  status  as  of  late  March  2020  at  the  earliest.  Therefore,  available  evidence
shows  that  Applicant  was  delinquent  on  these  debts  prior  to  any  placement  in  a
deferment  status.  This  debt  appears  on  the  2021  and  2020  credit  reports  with  a  last
activity date of May 2017. (Tr. 32-36, 40-41; Answer; GE 1-4; AE A)
The delinquent credit-card account in the amount of $4,467 listed in SOR ¶ 1.b
has not been resolved. Applicant claimed that she fell behind on this debt because of a
lack of income due to underemployment and unemployment while she cared for a family
member  who  was  ill.  She  stopped  making  payments  on  this  debt  in  about  May  2014.
She claimed that she contacted the creditor about another account she had with it and
paid  off  that  account,  but  has  not  made  any  effort  to  resolve  this  account.  This  debt
appears on the 2020 and 2019 credit reports. (Tr. 36-38; Answer; GE 1, 3, 4)
The  delinquent medical debts totaling  about $3,400  listed  in SOR ¶¶  1.c  through
1.f   are   being   resolved.   Applicant  incurred   these   debts  in   2016   when   she   had   surgery
without medical insurance. She  claimed  that she  has been  making  payments on  these
debts and  provided  documentation  showing  that she  made  monthly  payments to  a  debt
collector from  August 2021  until September 2022.  This document also showed  that she
made   a   $25   payment   in  January   2020   and   a   $100   payment  in  January   2021.   She
claimed  that the balance on these debts is about $900.  These  debts appear on  the  2019
credit report.  (Tr.  38-39,  42; Answer; GE 1, 4; AE  A)
Applicant  has  a  second  delinquent  federal  student  loan  in  the  amount  of  about
$30,000 that is not listed in the SOR.1  This account is also unresolved.  She made the
same attempts to resolve this account that she did with the aforementioned student loan
account listed in SOR ¶ 1.a. Available evidence shows that she was delinquent on this

debt prior to any placement in a deferment status. This debt appears on the 2021 credit
report with a last activity date of May 2017. (Tr. 36, 41; GE 1, 2; AE A)
In late 2021, Applicant contacted an individual in order to help clear up her credit
report.  She  paid  this  person  $150  to  have  her  dispute  the  entries  on  her  credit  report
regardless  of  whether  she  had  a  reasonable  basis  for  her  dispute.  She  engaged  this
individual for about  two  months.  She  claimed  that,  as  a  result  of  this  individual’s  help,
her  credit  score  rose,  and  some  entries  no  longer  appeared  on  her  credit  report.  This
individual did not assist Applicant with budgeting. (Tr. 38-40, 42-43)
