After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 47 years old and a high school graduate. He has been a self-employed
truck driver since November 2017, and has worked for a federal contractor since June
2019. He has lived with a cohabitant since May 2017 and has no children. (Items 3, 7)
The SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts, totaling approximately $38,014. In response
to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations at SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 1.h through 1.k.
He  reported  that  he  was  working  with  a  credit  repair  agency  to  resolve  his  debts  and
submitted a letter from a credit consultant that he had improved his financial position by
obtaining higher paying, more stable employment. He denied the allegations at SOR ¶¶
1.b, 1.d through 1g, and 1.l, stating that those accounts had been resolved. Credit records
reflect that the debts alleged at SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.l, totaling approximately $3,899,
were resolved before the SOR was issued, and that the debts alleged at SOR ¶¶ 1.b and
1.e, totaling approximately $8,370, were resolved before the FORM was issued. (Items
1, 2, 4, 5, 6)
In  his June  2019  security  clearance  application  (SCA), Applicant disclosed  that he
was more than  120  days’ delinquent on  the  accounts  alleged  at  SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  1.c,  for
the  deficiency  balance  on  two  vehicle  loan  accounts  totaling  $24,330  after  the   vehicles
were  voluntarily   repossessed   and   sold   at   auction.   He  also   reported   the   credit  card
account alleged  at SOR ¶  1.b  had  been  charged  off  for $7,080, that he  had  reached  a
settlement  agreement  with   the   creditor,  and   that  he   was  making   payments  under  that
agreement.   He   reported   financial  difficulties   in  2016   and   2017   and   attributed   those
difficulties to  low  wages at his previous employment.  He said that  he  had  sought higher
paying   employment   and   was  working   with   a   credit   counseling   and   repair   service  to
resolve his financial issues. (Item 3)
In  an  August  2019
interview  with  a  government
investigator,  Applicant
acknowledged  that  he  had  incurred  the  debts  alleged  at  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.l,  and
stated his intent to resolve those debts. He attributed his financial difficulties to low wages,
and  said  that  he  would  secure  more  lucrative  employment.  He  reported  that  he  was
working with a debt consolidation service and was making monthly payments in an effort
to resolve his debts. He said that his financial condition was good, that he was willing and
able to repay his debts, and that his financial problems would not recur. (Item 7)
The evidence concerning debts alleged the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶1.a: charged-off auto loan for $11,603. This account was opened in April
2014 and became delinquent in October 2016.  Applicant reported that the vehicle was
voluntarily repossessed, sold at auction, that the account was delinquent in the amount
of $11,609, that he had engaged a credit counseling and repair service, and that he was
making payments on the account as part of a debt consolidation plan. The July 2019 and
February  2020  credit  reports  reflect  the  account  as  charged  off  and  past  due  in  the
amount  of  $11,603.  In  response  to  the  FORM,  Applicant  submitted  evidence  that  the
deficiency  balance  had  been  reduced  to  $9,920,  that  the  creditor  agreed  to  settle  the
account  for  $2,580,  and  that  he  had  made  the  final  payment  under  the  agreement  in
March 2022. This debt is now resolved. (Items 3, 4, 5, 7; AE C, D)
SOR ¶ 1.b: credit-card account charged off for $7,080. This account was first
delinquent in 2016. Applicant reported the account as delinquent in the amount of $7,080,
and stated that he would make payments under a settlement agreement. The July 2019
credit report reflects the account was charged off for $7,080. The February 2020 credit
report reflects the account as charged off, but subject to a payment plan with a past-due
balance of $1,131. The March 2022 credit report reflects that the charge off was settled
for less than the full balance. This debt is resolved. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
SOR ¶ 1.c: charged-off joint account auto loan for $6,925. This account was
opened  in  March  2017  and  became  delinquent  in  about  November  2017.  Applicant

in the amount of $6,925, and that he was making payments on the account as part of a
debt consolidation plan. The July 2019, February 2020, and March 2022 credit reports
reflect  the  account  as  charged  off  and  past  due  in  the  amount  of  $6,925.  Applicant
provided evidence that the creditor agreed to settle the account for $1,000, and that he
paid off the account in March 2022. This debt is resolved. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; AE E, F)
SOR ¶ 1.d:  collection account for $2,600. This account was first delinquent in
2016. The July 2019 credit report reflects the account as in collection with a balance of
$3,000. Applicant reported that he was making monthly payments on his debts through a
debt consolidation service. The February 2020 credit report reflects the account balance
in collection had been reduced to $2,600, that “[Applicant] disputes –  reinvestigation in
process.” This account does not appear in his March 2022 credit report. Applicant claimed
that  he  settled  this account  in  response  to  the  SOR  and  FORM.  Although  he  failed  to
provide documentary evidence, and this debt may have fallen off his credit report for other
reasons, I have given him credit for his past payments on this debt, and based upon the
entire record find that this account has been resolved. (Items 2, 4, 5, 6, 7; AE B)
SOR  ¶1.e:  charge  account  charged  off  for  $1,290.  This  account  was  first
