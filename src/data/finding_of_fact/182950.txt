In setting forth my findings, some details, including specific amounts of income and
tax liabilities, were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific information is
available in the cited exhibits and transcript. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and
transcript, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant  is  61  years old.  He  has  his bachelor’s  degree  with  a  concentration  in
finance and his master’s degree in business administration. The degrees were earned in
May  1984  and  May  2003,  respectively.  In  October  2013,  he  began  consulting  for  a
company that has DOD contracts. At the time, the company had a sole owner who was
seeking to retire. Applicant became a full-time employee of the company in February 2014,
earning $220,000 a year. (Tr. 76-77.) In late November 2015, with a $21 million line of
credit,  he  became  a  one-fifth  owner  of  the  company,  which  is  structured  as  an  S
corporation for tax purposes. (Tr. 77.) He was the company’s chief financial officer before
2021 when he became its vice chairman and chief strategic officer. (GE 1; Tr. 26-31.) He is
required to obtain a security clearance because of his position as a senior management
official. (Tr. 30.) Pending a final adjudication of Applicant’s security clearance eligibility, the
company’s  board  of  directors  has  temporarily  excluded  him  from  access  to  classified
information. (AEs H-I.)
Applicant and his spouse have been married since September 1992. They have a
25-year-old  son  and  a  27-year-old  daughter who live independently. Applicant and his
spouse have owned their current residence since January 1996. (GE 1; Tr. 23-24.) In May
2007, they  refinanced  the  primary  mortgage  on  their  home  for a  loan  of  $810,000. (GEs 4-
5.)
Applicant worked in the banking industry after college. He was laid off in 2000 from
his employment as chief operating officer for a bank. He lost his base salary of $140,000.
(Tr. 80.) He was given severance, but not enough to cover his annual expenses, so he
worked for another bank, earning $160,000 per year, until he was laid off in 2005, as the
industry underwent some consolidation and contraction. He then worked for an investment
company  at  $150,000  per  year  (Tr.  80),  knowing  that  his  position  was  going  to  be
eliminated within two years, so in June 2006, he started his own consulting business. (GE
1; Tr. 28-33.) Applicant did not have sufficient funds withheld or set aside for his taxes
when he was self-employed as future work was not guaranteed. (Tr. 81-84.)
Through September 2013, Applicant was self-employed as a consultant performing
operational and financial reviews and evaluating marketing programs and profitability for
his clients, which included a shipbuilding company; a toy train manufacturer; a software
sales developer; a hardware company; and a sail maker. (GE 1; Tr. 29.) Applicant was,
and continues to be, the sole income earner in his household. (Tr. 34.)  He had a sizeable
mortgage on his home as well as car loans, and found it challenging to “maintain a cost of
living that was acceptable.” (Tr. 33-34.) His income fluctuated considerably over the years
(Tr. 79) and was as low as $40,000 annually at one point. Applicant reduced expenses by
eating at home rather than at restaurants and taking vacations close to home. He worked
with his creditors to address his debts. Some debts were paid late. He regained financial
stability about the time that he started his present employment. (Tr. 33-36.)
Applicant and his spouse filed their joint income tax returns on time, but sometimes
they filed amended returns. He testified that it became difficult at times to estimate his tax
liability. (Tr. 38.) There were times when he was self-employed when he sent in a payment
with their tax return but it was less than what he owed. (Tr. 44, 85.) He admits that he
“should have been following [his] ups and downs in income.” (Tr. 51.) However, for some
tax years, he was billed late for taxes owed for a prior TY. (Tr. 86.) Tax underpayments by
them  or  tax  adjustments  by  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  and/or  their  state’s
Department of Revenue led to tax liens being placed against their property for unpaid taxes
for some tax years. (GE 3; Tr. 44.) Available tax records reflect the following, rounded
down  to  the  nearest  hundred,  with  respect  to  their  federal  and  state  tax  liabilities  and
repayment status:

On November 18, 2016, Applicant completed an SF 86, not having previously held a
security clearance. He responded negatively to all of the SF 86’s financial record inquiries,
including the following:
In the  past seven (7) years  have  you  failed  to  file  or pay  Federal, state, or
other taxes when required by law or ordinance? and
In  the   past  seven  (7)  years,  [have]  you   had   a   lien   placed   against   your
property  for failing  to  pay  taxes or other debts.  (Include  financial obligations
for which you  were the  sole debtor, as well  as those  for which you  were a
cosigner or guarantor). (GE 1.)
On  October  4,  2018,  Applicant  had  a  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  with  an
authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). When asked about
the SF 86 query concerning any liens in the last seven years, Applicant stated that he was
not certain how to answer the question. He explained that he did not believe he had any
liens against him, but he had been on a payment plan to resolve a tax lien issue from 2009.
He explained that he had some financial issues in 2009 when he was self-employed and
became delinquent on some $40,000 in federal income taxes. He stated that his taxes
were not fully paid off. When confronted with the record of tax liens that had been filed
against him as of his PSI (in February 2008 for $8,700; in December 2009 for $17,400; in
July 2010 for $57,100 and $40,700; in September 2011 for $15,700; and in October 2016
for $82,300), Applicant expressed his belief that they all stemmed from the original tax lien
in 2009. (GE 2.) When asked on cross-examination why he did not fully disclose his tax
problems, he testified, in part:
I explained  to  [the  OPM  investigator] I was going  through  a  payment plan
with  the  IRS. She  did not ask any  details whatsoever. And  I said I was on
target —  and was paying my taxes. . .  So it was noticed. (Tr. 96-97.)
Since 2016, most of Applicant’s income has been S corporation distributions that he
states have been used to pay his tax liabilities. (AE N; Tr. 66-67, 72-73.) Applicant testified
that in 2017 and 2018, he took S corporation distributions at least three times a year, which
resulted in a large increase in his federal income tax liability for those TYs. (Tr. 88.) His and
his spouse’s federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2016 through 2020 show
the following with respect to his income and their joint tax liabilities, rounded down to the
nearest hundred:

Applicant asserts that he was unaware before his PSI that tax liens had been filed
against him. He denies ever receiving any notice of a tax lien having been filed. (Tr. 38-39,
47.) The Government submitted notices of federal and state tax liens for the TYs alleged.
Those notices were filed against Applicant and his spouse and properly recorded with the
registry of deeds in their county. (GE 3.) No evidence was presented showing that the lien
notices  were  mailed  to  Applicant.  He  knew  he  owed  taxes  and  indicated  that  to  his
understanding, the IRS may choose or not to issue a lien for unpaid taxes. (Tr. 47-48.) He
asserted in response to the SOR, “It is practice for any tax discrepancy that there be a lien
placed no matter if the issue is [the] taxpayer or Department of Revenue.” (Answer.)
Regarding adjustments to his federal and state tax liabilities, Applicant asserts that
when  he  was  notified  of  adjustments,  he  immediately  communicated  with  the  tax
authorities. He was assigned a representative and entered into payment plans to pay the
taxes. (Tr. 38-39, 48, 52.) He admitted that he paid some taxes late. (Tr. 47.) Applicant
maintains  his  own  records  of  tax  payments,  which  indicate  that  he  paid  the  IRS
approximately $3.4 million between October 18, 2016, and May 13, 2022, in addition to his
standard coupon payments based on his tax returns. (Tr. 92.) Applicant’s payment records
show that, in 2016, he paid the IRS only $1,000 a week from October 18, 2016, through
December 27, 2016, when his income exceeded $1 million that year. His weekly payment
increased over time (to $1,500 from mid-January 2017 to mid-February 2017; $1,900 from
mid-February 2017 to mid-June 2017; $2,500 from mid-June 2017 to late December 2017;
$4,000 throughout 2020; $5,000 from January 2021 to mid-April 2021; and $10,000 since
then).Included in the $3.4 million were the tax withholdings from his base salary (Tr. 109),
which  for  recent  years  were  as  follows:  $35,000  for  TY  2017;  $24,300  for  TY  2018;
$54,200 for TY 2019; $67,800 for TY 2020; and $65,400 for TY 2021 (AE L); and also
some quarterly lump-sum payments as large as $150,000 to $250,000 as determined by
the IRS. (Tr. 110-111.) Assuming he submitted sizeable estimated tax payments, the tax
lien for 2017 and 2018 clearly shows that his estimated payments fell considerably short of
what he and his spouse owed. Payment records from his bank show that just over $1.9
million was debited from his bank account between November 20, 2020, and May 6, 2022.
(AE  K.)  Applicant  estimated  that,  as  of  mid-August 2022, he  has paid more than $3.7
million in taxes, including fees and penalties, with no effort on his part to reduce his tax
burden. (Tr. 39.) As to why he did not indicate on his SF 86 that he had failed to pay some
taxes on time in the seven years preceding his November 2016 SF 86, Applicant reiterated
that  he  was  unaware  of  the  tax  liens  and  that,  while  he  was  late  in  making  certain
payments to the IRS, he was making payments. (Tr. 68.) He testified that “anything that
[he] had to pay that was late [he] never thought of that as being that negative.” (Tr. 69.) He
subsequently explained,
So  I filed  my  taxes, and  I’ve  been  paying  the  taxes. Did  I pay  it in full?  No.  I
didn’t know  the  answer should have  been, no. I didn’t know  I should have
answered,  I  have   filed   the   taxes  on   time,  but  I  owe   the   IRS   some   extra
money. (Tr. 93.)
He testified that he read the SF 86 question about failing to pay any federal, state, or local
taxes in the last seven years as “that [he] failed and didn’t pay any tax.” (Tr. 94-95.)
In  2021,  Applicant’s  company  exceeded  expectations  and  earned  a  profit  of
approximately  $11  million.  Currently,  Applicant  and  his  partners  each  receive  a  base
annual salary of $460,000. (Tr. 31.) He indicated that he not only has paid off the founder
of the company but that he has obtained an additional $30 million in credit to pay off other
partners. (Tr. 69-70.)
Applicant is on  a  repayment plan  with  the  IRS  for TY  2020. (Tr. 40.) He reports that
he  owed  approximately  $500,000  in 2016, which is down  to  “slightly  under”  $400,000, and
a  little less than  $1.3  million  for 2020, which is down  to  about $800,000. (Tr. 52, 108.)  He
makes weekly  payments to  the  IRS  (Tr. 52, 108)  and  controls  the  payments.  In  addition,  he
is required to make quarterly payments of $250,000. (Tr. 53.)
Applicant’s February 2020 credit report showed that, in August 2019, he obtained a
$300,000 loan (balance $293,454) and a vehicle loan for $84,185 (balance $75,898). (GE
5.) He testified that the $300,000 was a home-equity loan. (Tr. 103.) When asked why he
took on such a sizeable automobile loan when he had such a large federal income tax
delinquency,  he  testified  that  he  thought  he  could  afford  the  payments  but  turned  the
vehicle in to the dealer after only three months.  The home-equity loan went to college
tuition. (Tr. 104-105.)
Applicant provided a current estimate of monthly expenses totaling $6,294, including
$4,300 for his mortgage, but only $94 in electricity costs and $400 for gasoline. (AE O.) He
converted his heat system to natural gas, and recently upgraded his air conditioning units.
(Tr. 37.) As of February 2020, the balance on their primary mortgage was $665,972 with
scheduled repayment at $4,028 per month. (GE 5.) As of July 27, 2022, their mortgage
balance  was  $572,407.  (AE  E.)  He  testified  that  was  paying  $5,000  a  month  on  his
mortgage as of mid-August 2022. (Tr. 108.) Applicant has about $380,000 in combined
investment and retirement assets. (Tr. 37.)
Applicant has held several voluntary positions in the communities where he has
lived  over  the  years,  including  as  a  volunteer  fireman,  the  founder  of  a  street  hockey
league, youth sports coach, treasurer of a local yacht club, and board member of his town’s
finance committee. (Tr. 24-25.)
Character References
Two long-time friends of Applicant attest to him being hardworking, honest, and
reliable. They endorse Applicant for a security clearance as he is willing to follow rules and
dedicated to maintaining confidentiality. (AE F.) Neither of the friends commented about
Applicant’s  tax  issues,  so  it  is  unclear  whether  they  are  aware  of  his  substantial  tax
underpayments that led to the issuance of both federal and state tax liens.
A certified public accountant, who recently retired from being managing director of
the  firm  that  provided  audit and  tax  compliance  services for Applicant’s company, has
provided  individual  tax  preparation  services  for  Applicant  since  2017.  He  attests  that
Applicant always “processed” his tax returns on time and that he appropriately addressed
any adjustments made to his tax returns by the tax authorities. He considers Applicant to
be willing and dedicated to maintaining confidentiality and recommends him for clearance
eligibility. (AE G.)
