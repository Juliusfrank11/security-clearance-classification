Applicant is a 58-year-old civilian employee of a defense contractor who seeks a
security clearance. Allegations admitted are incorporated in the findings. Findings of fact
follow.
Background
Applicant married in August 1990 and has two adult children from this marriage.
(GE 1) He attended college classes between January 2000 and May 2000, but he did
not earn a degree or diploma. (GE 1) He reported no military service.
Since   April  2017,   Applicant  has  been   employed   by   his  current  employer  as  a
machine   supervisor.  (GE  1;   Tr.  47-48)  He   was  employed   by   this  same   employer
between  December 1995  and  September 2014  before leaving  this employer for a  two-
year  period  of  self-employment  with  his  father  in  a  joint  venture  start-up  tooling
company (2015-2017). (GE 1; Tr. 46-47)
Without  any  income  from  his  start-up  venture,  Applicant  fell  behind  with  his
creditors.  By  December  2016,  following  a  tornado  strike  on  his  home,  he  became
delinquent  on  his  home  with  virtually  no  income  to  fund  his  mortgage  and  necessary
repairs  to  his  home.  (Tr.  47)  Applicant  has  never  held  a  security  clearance  and  is
currently sponsored by his employer for a clearance. (GE 1)
Applicant’s finances
Applicant purchased a home in November 2014 and financed it with a mortgage
of $165,000. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 33, 56) He replaced this mortgage in August 2017 with a new
mortgage of $214,000. (GEs 2-3 and AEs A-B; Tr. 32-33) Credit records document that
this  mortgage  was  purchased  by  another  lender  for  $218,000.  (GEs  2-3)  In  February
2022,  Applicant  refinanced his home  with  another mortgage  lender  for $326,000  (GEs
2-3 and AEs A-B; Tr. 31-34, 59-60)
After the payoff of his first mortgage, Applicant received around $70,000 from the
loan disbursements, which he used to pay off his remaining debts and get “us totally out
of  debt  with  that.”  (AEs  F-J;  Tr.  87-88)  In  refinancing  his  home  with  his  current
mortgagee,  he  was  able  to  lower  his  mortgage  while  saving  interest  accruals  on  his
debts.
Between  August  2010  and  December  2015,  Applicant  opened  a  number  of
education and consumer accounts. Credit reports confirm he co-signed a  student loan
with his daughter that included a high credit allowance of $16,786. (GEs 2-3) While his
daughter made several payments initially on the loan, she failed to follow through with
her scheduled payments and permitted the loan to fall into default by March 2018. (GEs
2-3)  Burdened  by  his  own  debts,  Applicant  was  not  financially  able  at  the  time  to
assume responsibility for his daughter’s payment obligations. (GEs 2-3 and 5; Tr. 22-23,
36, and 47)
Other debts that Applicant could not afford to address during his extended period
of  underemployment  and  unemployment  in  2016-2017  include  three  credit  card  debts
covered by SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d-1e. These three credit card debts have since been paid
off by Applicant and no longer appear on his credit reports. (AEs B and D-J) Applicant’s
most recent credit reports reveal a solid credit score of 718. (AE B; Tr. 32) He maintains
an average balance of $776 in his checking account. (AE D; Tr. 38)
