Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶  1.a,  as  amended,  and  the  newly  added  SOR  ¶  1.b.
Her admissions  are  incorporated  into  the findings  of  fact.  After a thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  56  years  old.  She  has  a  high  school  diploma  and  is  trained  as  a
licensed  practical  nurse  (LPN).  She  was  married  twice,  and  has  four  grown  children.
She  worked  as  an  LPN  from  2013  to  2019,  and  still  does  part-time  work  in  that  field.
She also works in software. She has  worked for a DOD contractor since  2017. (GE 1;
Tr. 40)
On  her  e-QIP,  Applicant  disclosed  unpaid  taxes  and  unfiled  tax  returns  for  tax
years 2016 and 2017, and an older tax debt, from about 2010. (GE 1 at 49-51)
Applicant  testified  that  she  has  always  been  a  salaried  “W-2”  employee.  Her
2018  tax  debt  resulted  from  her  status  as  an  independent  contractor,  a  “1099”
employee,  because  she  did  not  understand  that  as  a  “1099”  independent  contractor,
she, rather than her employer, was responsible for withholding taxes from her pay. (Tr.
42-46) In 2018, she earned over $163,000 in taxable income but had little withheld. (GE
7, AE C)
Applicant usually requests a filing extension for her federal tax returns. She said
she  started  her  job  as  a  DOD  contractor  in  September  2017.  If  she  had  filed  for  an
extension, her 2016 federal taxes would have been due not in April 2017, but in October
2017.  She  said  she  did  not  have  an  excuse  for  not  filing,  just  overwork  and  travel.
Applicant  explained  that  her  DOD  job  involved  work  in  states  located  away  from  her
home, long days and working weekends.
Applicant received an interrogatory from DOHA about her taxes in March 2020.
(GE 2) She said she prepared and filed her federal tax returns for tax years 2016, 2017,
and 2018 some time afterwards, in 2020. She asserted that she did so while working on
an assignment in another state, and that she returned home in fall 2020, after she was
promoted.  She  said  she  prepares  her  tax  forms  herself,  using  well-known  tax
preparation software. (Tr. 47-48, 52-53, 68-70, 78-79)
With her answer, Applicant provided signed copies of her 2016, 2017, and 2018
federal tax returns. Those returns are signed on January 23, 2021. (AE A, AE B, AE C)
Applicant’s federal account transcripts for those tax years reflect that she filed her 2016
return in October 2021, her 2017 return in November 2021, and her 2018 return in April
2022. (GE 5, GE 6, GE 7)
Applicant’s  2016   federal  account   transcript   reflects   a   $1,335   credit  that  was
transferred   to   address   her  2018   tax   debt.   (Tr.  48-49;  GE   5;   AE  A)   For 2017,   she   paid
$103.  (GE   6)   Her  2018   account  transcript   reflects   that  she   earned   over  $163,000   but
had little  withheld.  She  now  owes $40,291  in  taxes, penalties,  and  interest.  (GE  7; AE
C)  (SOR ¶  1.b)
Applicant does not have to pay state income taxes in her home state.  She said
she  filed  her  2019  and  2020  federal  returns  with  extensions.  (Tr.  54-55)  She  filed  her
2021 tax returns the day before the hearing. She said she was due a refund of $1,233,
an amount that will likely be recaptured to address her 2018 tax debt. (Tr. 35, 54-56, 66)
Applicant’s  plan  to  address  her  $40,000  tax  debt  from  2018  is  to  refinance  her
home and to use the equity in the home to address her taxes. She recently remodeled
the  home,  where  she  lives  with  her  mother.  She  said  she  bought  the  home  from  her
mother,  and  it  has  a  $64,000  mortgage.  (Tr.  86-88;  AE  D)  At  the  time  of  the  hearing,
she had no plan in place to address the debt. She said she had received a letter from
the IRS, but acknowledged that it was her responsibility to act on it. (Tr. 90-94)
Applicant  is  again  a  W-2  employee,  and  no  longer  an  independent  contractor.
She earns $47 an hour. She earned $104,000 in 2021. She has an extra $50 taken out
weekly for her past-due taxes. (Tr. 63, PH 3 at 2) She said her income and expenses
are  “holding  steady,”  although  she  has  little  to  no  current  savings  due  to  the  home
remodeling project. (Tr. 59-61) Her credit reports do not reflect any significant financial
issues. (GE 3, GE 4)
Applicant also has a federal tax lien filed in 2004, for $8,553. (GE 8) She testified
that  she  went  to  her  county  courthouse  to  research  the  status  of  the  2004  federal tax
lien.  The  clerk  told  her  they  had  no  record  of  it.  (Tr.  33-34)  The  2004  tax  lien  is  not
alleged in the SOR. She acknowledged prior tax debt (2004 lien) and prior filing issues
(2010-2016). She offered  no explanation for the tax debt and  said she had no excuse
for failing to file her tax returns, other than immaturity and the press of work and travel.
(Tr. 40, 90)
After  the  hearing,  Applicant  submitted  updated  documentation  about  her  recent
tax filings.  Her 2019 federal tax return,  provided  with  extensive  documentation,  shows
taxable income of $57,493, and a $1,268 refund. (PH 2 at 2)
Applicant’s  2020  federal  tax  return  shows  taxable  income  of  $44,728,  and  a
refund  due  of  $3,706.  (PH  3)  For  tax  year  2021,  she  earned  a  taxable  income  of
$104,336, and was to be refunded $1,233, as noted above. (PH 4)
Applicant also provided a Form 9465 Installment Agreement Request. It covers
tax  years  2004,  2008-2011,  2014,  and  2018.  She  reported  that  she  owed  $69,560  in
past-due  taxes,  and  paid  the  first  $560.  She  reported  that  she  could  pay  $500  per
month, and she provided the routing and account numbers for her bank so the money
could be withdrawn automatically. (PH 5)
Applicant  also  provided  a  post-hearing  statement.  She  acknowledged  that  she
thought  she had  improved  her standing by being honest about her past-due  taxes  but
now realizes there is more work to do. Her tax problems began when she was a single
mother, raising her children without financial support, while working three jobs to make
ends meet.  She  had  no  excuse for failing to file  her tax  returns  properly,  but  said  she
never owed  taxes until 2014. (This could mean  “2004,” the  year of the tax lien). She  is
now in contact with the IRS to address her taxes. (PH 5, PH 6)
Applicant  closed her statement by stressing that she  loves her job working  with
the  military,  and  feels  rewarded  by  the  work,  as  she  does  with  nursing.  She  needs  a
“CAC” card to do her job. She offered to “keep someone updated” on her progress, and
requested to  leave  the record open for another  three to six months so  she  could hear
from the IRS. She said she would resolve her taxes as soon as she could and will file
her tax returns on time in the future. (PH 6)
Applicant also provided several references, all of whom said she does a good job
and  is  a  valued,  sought-after  team  member  due  to  her  comprehensive  knowledge,
training expertise, and communication skills. (PH 1)
