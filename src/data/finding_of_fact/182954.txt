Applicant is a 49-year-old single woman. She was married from 2006 to 2018, when
she and her husband divorced. (Item 3 at 27) Applicant is a college graduate, earning a
degree in 1997. (Item 3 at 17) Since October 2018 she has been working for a defense
contractor as an engineer. (item 3 at 18; Item 8 at 2)
Applicant’s  marriage  was  extremely abusive.  (Item 8 at 7) Her husband was so
volatile that when Applicant fled from him in October 2017, she hid her location, blocked
his  phone  number,  and  was  compelled  to  move  several  times,  as  he  stalked  her  and
harassed  her  friends  who  knew  her  whereabouts.  (Item  8  at  6  - 9)  Applicant  legally
divorced him in July 2018.
Applicant’s  marital  problems  and  subsequent  divorce  corresponded  with  her
financial problems, as alleged in the SOR.  Specifically, when Applicant prepared to file her
first federal and state income tax returns after her 2018 divorce, she discovered that her
ex-husband, who was responsible for filing their income tax returns during the marriage,
had not filed their federal and state income tax returns from 2015 to 2017, and that she
was delinquent on her federal income taxes in the amount of $19,749 for tax years 2013
and 2014. (Answer at 1 -2; Item 8 at 6-7)
In  April  2019,  Applicant  retained  an  accountant  to  help  resolve  her  income  tax
delinquencies. (Item 10 at 3) The accountant advised her to gather all of her old financial
records so that he could review them and prepare the returns. This was a daunting task for
Applicant because all of her old financial information were in the home where “she had fled
. . .after a final altercation” with her husband in October 2017. (Item 10 at 3) Nevertheless,
Applicant, by December 2019, had largely contacted all of the entities, such as mortgage
companies, insurance companies, employers, and banks, that she needed to reconstruct
her tax records for 2015 to 2017. (Item 10 at 3)
At  or  about  the  time  Applicant  was  reconstructing  her  financial  records,  her
accountant  contacted  her  ex-husband  to  persuade  him  to  file  his  income  taxes  under
“married filing joint” status for tax years 2015 to 2017, explaining that filing jointly would
result in a larger deduction and a lower tax rate. (Item 2 at 4; Item 11 at 3) Applicant’s ex-
husband initially agreed to provide whatever documents needed to file jointly, but never
followed  through.  By  December  2020,  he  had  stopped  responding  to  Applicant’s
accountant entirely. (Item 10 at 3)
In February 2022, Applicant’s accountant characterized the filing of Applicant’s back
tax returns as “currently in progress,” and anticipated that they would be completed by April
2022. (Item 9 at 2) In March 2022, Applicant’s accountant drafted the tax returns for 2015
through 2017 for Applicant’s review. By June 2022, 15 months after answering the SOR,
Applicant had not yet filed the back tax returns for 2015 to 2017. Per her accountant, they
anticipate filing these returns by late September 2022. (Item 11 at 1)
Applicant  contends  that  she  has  filed  her tax returns for 2018 to 2021 and that
refunds have been applied to her delinquencies for earlier tax years. (Item 11 at 4) Per an
IRS tax transcript, $1,608 of a refund received in 2019 was credited to Applicant’s 2013
delinquency.  (Item  4 at 12)  There is no additional documentary evidence of  payments
toward the delinquencies on file. Applicant has not yet submitted a payment plan to the IRS
for the 2013 and 2014 tax delinquencies. (Item 11 at 4)
Applicant incurred approximately $6,600 of delinquent consumer debts over the
years, as alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.d through 1.j. (Item 2 at 2) These debts became
delinquent in approximately 2015 when Applicant’s then husband, upon whom she was
dependent to help make ends meet, lost his job. (Item 8 at 8)
After Applicant finalized her divorce and obtained a better-paying job in 2018, she
began paying the delinquent bills. (Item 8 at 12) Subparagraph 1.d is a utility bill, totaling
$512, Applicant satisfied this bill in February 2022. (Item 9 at 3)
Subparagraph 1.e is a credit card bill, totaling $454. Applicant satisfied this bill in
January 2021, before the issuance of the SOR. (Item 9 at 4)
Subparagraph 1.f is a credit card bill, totaling $3,916. By February 2021, before the
issuance of the SOR, she had satisfied this debt. (Item 9 at 5)
Subparagraph 1.g is a credit card bill, totaling $534. Applicant satisfied this debt in
February 2021, before the issuance of the SOR. (Item 9 at 6)
Subparagraph 1.i is a credit card bill, totaling $1,203. By March 2022, Applicant had
satisfied this debt. (Item 9 at 7)
Applicant contends that she satisfied the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.h and
1.j, totaling $1,603. (Item 9 at 1) She provided no documentary evidence.
While Applicant was married, she used alcohol to cope with the emotional trauma
caused  by  her  husband’s  abusive  behavior.  (Item  8  at  7)  Within  a  three-week  period
between December 2015 and January 2016, Applicant was arrested twice and charged
with operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. (Item 8 at 5) The second arrest
occurred while the hearing for the first charge was pending. Before both arrests, applicant
had  consumed  two  pints  of  vodka.  (Item  8  at  5)  Under a  plea  agreement,  the  second
charge  was  dismissed,  and  Applicant  agreed  to  complete  an  alcohol  education  class,
complete counseling, pay a fine, and serve 18 months of probation. (Item 9 at 2 at 5-6;
Item 9 at 13-20) After Applicant completed the terms of the probation, the court dismissed
the charges.
Now  that  Applicant  is  no  longer  married,  she  does  not  drink  alcohol  to  excess.
Instead, she drinks approximately two drinks per month, and spends her free time at the
gym  rather  than  at  bars.  (Item  8  at  6)  She  has  not  had  any  alcohol-related  arrests  or
charges since January 2016.
