From  approximately  2010  to  2015, Applicant  was a  state  government employee.
He worked  as a  counselor for mentally  challenged  individuals. He was laid  off  in June
2015, when  the  state  government elected  to  close  the  facility  in which  he  worked. He was
subsequently  unemployed  or underemployed  as a driver  for a  ride  sharing  service, during
which time  he  obtained  his bachelor’s degree.  From  2019  to  November 2021, he  worked
as a  cybersecurity  auditor for a  DOD contractor. He was laid  off  because  he  did  not have
a   security   clearance.  Since   November 2021,  he   has  been   a   self-employed   community
youth   teacher.  He   taught  members  of   the   youth   community   computer  skills,  and   he
assisted   them   with   obtaining   cybersecurity  certifications  that  enabled   them   to   find
corporate   employment.   The   DOD  contractor  for  whom   he   previously   worked   was
sponsoring  him  for a  security  clearance.  (Tr.  at  6-7, 18-19,  35-36,  41-43, 50-55, 58,  60-

The SOR alleged that Applicant had eight delinquent consumer accounts, totaling
$236,555 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.h) and a $36,541 delinquent child support obligation (SOR ¶
1.i). The SOR allegations are established  by Applicant’s admissions  in his Answer; his
November  2018  security  clearance  application  (SCA);  the  background  interviews
conducted in 2018 and 2019; by credit bureau reports from 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022;
and by documentation from the creditors for SOR debts ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.i. SOR
debts ¶¶ 1.c and 1.i are reported on the January 2019 credit bureau report. SOR debts
¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e to 1.h are reported on the June 2019 credit bureau report. SOR debt
¶¶ 1.a to 1.f are reported on the 2020 credit bureau report. SOR debts ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c are
reported on the 2021 credit bureau report. SOR debts ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c are reported on the
2022 credit bureau report. (Answer; GE 1-10; AE A, B)
Applicant  attributed  his  delinquent  debts  to  his  period  of  unemployment  or
underemployment from 2015 to 2019, and his decrease in income after 2021. He earned
approximately $32,000 annually from around 2013 to 2015, and approximately $73,000
annually from 2019 to 2021. He attributed his child support arrears to the child support
enforcement agency’s decision in 2014, that in addition to paying $1,202 monthly, he was
obligated to pay an unrecalled lump sum amount that dated back to 2013.  Although he
made payments toward his child support obligation in 2014 through pay withholdings, his
arrearage increased when he became unemployed and underemployed. During this time,
he  unsuccessfully  attempted  to  modify  his  child  support  obligation.  He  resolved  his
delinquent debts and child support arrearage by gradually paying them one at a time, with
money he saved when he worked for a DOD contractor from 2019 to 2021, with money
he earned as a community youth teacher since 2021, and through interception of his tax
refunds, as further discussed below. (Tr. at 29-37, 41-48, 58, 60-61, 64-73; GE 1, 10; AE

and  carried  a  delinquent  balance  of  $6,356.  Applicant  entered  into  a  payment  plan  of
