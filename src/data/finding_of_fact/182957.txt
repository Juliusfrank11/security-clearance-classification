Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  –  1.o  and  1.q.  She  denied  SOR  ¶  1.p.  She
provided  narrative  statements  with  her  answers.  Her  admissions  and  statements  are
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and the record evidence submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  66  years  old.  She  has  a  high  school  diploma  and  some  other
schooling. She was married for 32 years, from 1986 until her husband died in July 2018.
She  has  two  adult  daughters.  She  worked  as  a  cleared  employee  of  another  federal
government  agency  (AGA)  for  forty  years,  from  1976  until  August  2016,  when  she
retired as GS-8, step 10, with a salary of about $62,000. (Tr. 12-13, 45-47) She lived in
State  1  from  1987  to  2016,  until  moving  to  State  2  shortly  after  she  retired.  She  was
unemployed until February 2017, when she began working for a federal contractor, her
current  sponsor for a clearance.  She  works on  a DOD facility,  but is contracted to the
same federal agency from which she retired in 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 45-50, 89)
The SOR alleges over $230,000 in past-due federal student loans, bank or credit
card debts of about $4,300, and some past-due state tax debt. Applicant disclosed her
financial  issues  on  her  SCA  and  she  discussed  her  debts  during  her  May  2019
background  interview. (GE 1, GE  2) Applicant’s debts are detailed  on  the  credit reports
in the record,  from May 2019, March 2020, and March 2022. (GE 2, GE 3, GE  4).
Applicant  testified  that  in  the  mid-1990s,  her  husband  began  acting  erratically,
exhibiting  symptoms  of  what  was  later  diagnosed  as  bipolar  disorder  or  manic
depression.  He  stopped  working and  began  making large  family decisions  unilaterally,
such as moving the family into  his mother’s house. He  assumed  the  mortgage  for  that
home after his mother died, in about 1999-2000, but did not pay the mortgage. He also
quit his job without Applicant’s knowledge. Their young daughters also had a traumatic
experience  at  school,  and  Applicant’s  sister  was  diagnosed  with  a  chronic  disease
requiring continuing care. (Tr. 37-40, 53-58, 92; Answer)
Applicant’s husband’s troubles  continued  and  he  began taking out loans without
her knowledge. His paycheck was garnished to address those loans. Applicant took out
student loans to pay for her daughters’ education, expecting that her husband’s income
would help pay them back. (Tr. 40; Answer)
Applicant,  her  husband,  and  her  younger  daughter  moved  to  State  2  after  she
retired from federal service in 2016 because  of  the high cost of  living in State 1. They
moved into a home owned by Applicant’s brother and his wife. Applicant took the job as
a  federal  contractor  on  a  U.S.  government  facility  to  support  her  husband  and  his
medical expenses. His health deteriorated and he died in 2018. At the same time, she
was  contacted  by  student  loan  creditors  asking  for  increased  payments  she  could  not
afford. (Tr. 40-42, 89-90; Answer)
Applicant  was  doing  her  best  to  pay  her  bills.  She  also  had  to  purchase  a  new
car when her car died, and the new car was totaled in an accident in State 1 while she
was there for her daughter’s wedding. She used her federal retirement payments to pay
for  the  car.  Student  loan  payments  have  been  on  hold  due  to  the  COVID-19
moratorium. (Tr. 41-42)
Applicant  and  her  husband  filed  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  petition  in  2009.  The
bankruptcy  was  discharged  in  September  2014.  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  Applicant  paid  about
$60,000  into  the  bankruptcy  plan,  about  $1,500  per  month.  She  kept  her  federal
employer’s security  office appropriately  informed  during  the  process.  (GE 5; Tr. 50-52,
58-62, 103-105; Answer)
SOR ¶¶  1.c ($54,010);  1.d  ($53,061);  1.e  ($51,333);  1.f ($27,326);  1.g  ($23,531);
1.h   ($19,875);   1.i  ($18,038);   and   1.j  ($11,005)  are  all   federal  student  loans  that
Applicant took out  for her daughter’s college  education.  (GE 3) The  credit reports in  the
record show  that  she  took out  the  loans between  2011  and  2014  while  her bankruptcy
case  was pending. (GE  2  –  GE  5)  They  are  all  still  listed  as  past due  on  an  April 2022
credit report. (GE 4) Interest  of $17,335  on  her student loans accrued  in 2019. (AE  N)
Applicant  said   the   last   time   she   made   any   payments   was  in  early   2020.  She   said   the
government  stopped   accepting   payments   under  the   COVID-19   moratorium.  She   said
she  was paying  on  the  loans before then, as money  was taken  out of her pay  and  her
government  annuity.  All   told,   about  $1,300   to   $1,400   per  month   was  going   towards
student loan  payments  before the  moratorium. (Tr. 63-69) When  payments were put on
hold,   Applicant  used   that  money   to   pay   expenses  related   to   her  daughter’s  wedding.
Her younger daughter is still  in school. Applicant realized  she  could not afford the  loans,
but  said  she   felt  like   a   failure  if   she   did  not  help  her  daughters.  (Tr.  63-72,  95-102;
Answer)
After the hearing, Applicant provided paystubs from her employer from 2019 and
2020,  showing  garnishments  of  her  pay  of  between  $205  and  $256  per  paycheck
towards  her student loans, until June 2020, when  none is shown. (AE  J, AE K, AE O,
AE P)
SOR  ¶  1.b  is  a  $2,000  delinquent  state  tax  debt  from  tax  year  2015,  owed  to
State  1.  The  debt  owed  is  now  approximately  $4,800  due  to  interest.  Applicant  paid
$2,000 in early 2022, and is on a $254 per month payment plan for the next 12 months.
(Tr. 72-76; AE E, AE H) This debt is being resolved.
SOR  ¶¶  1.k  ($968), 1.m  ($764), and 1.q ($400) are  consumer debts  to  a  bank.
Applicant provided some documentation from early 2021 about two of these debts (AE
B  and  AE  C)  and  indicated  in  her  answer  that  she  would  resolve  them.  She  had  not
made any payments towards these accounts by the hearing date. (Tr. 78) They remain
listed as past due on an April 2022 credit report. (GE 4 at 7)
SOR ¶ 1.l ($801) is a consumer debt to another bank. Applicant paid the debt off
in  February  2021.  (Answer;  AE  A)  An  April  2022  credit  report  shows  that  the  account
was charged off but now has a zero balance. (GE 4 at 12) This debt is resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.n  ($545)  is  a  consumer  debt  to  a  bank.  SOR  ¶  1.o  ($439)  is  a  credit
account with a department store. SOR ¶ 1.p ($406) is a credit account with a bank. All
three debts are still listed as past-due as of April 2022. (GE 5 at 18)
Applicant  participated in  credit  counseling many years ago  and  also  during the
bankruptcy. (Tr. 87-88) She testified that she has every intention of paying on her debts.
She  said  it  is  not  easy  to  get  correct  contact  information  for  many  of  her  consumer
creditors  and  collection  agencies.  (Tr.  80-83;  AE  I,  AE  O,  AE  P)  Her  first  financial
priority  after  her  husband  died  was  to  pay  funeral  costs  and  to  pay  back  loans  from
family  members.  (Tr.  80-83)  She  plans  to  keep  working  for  another  five  years  and
paying her debts, and then retire back to State 1 to be near her daughter. (Tr. 107-108)
Applicant  earns  $28  an  hour  in  her  job.  (Tr.  94)  She  reported  a  monthly  net
annuity  of  $3,205  in  federal  retirement.  She  receives  about  $3,030  in  net  monthly
income  from  her  job.  On  a  personal financial  statement  prepared  for  the  hearing,  she
reported multiple credit card accounts she was paying down, most with balances of less
than $1,000. She also has a car payment of $338. No payments towards her SOR debts
are indicated. (AE D, AE F)
Applicant’s  brother  and  sister-in-law  wrote  letters  of  reference.  They  noted  the
many  family  hardships  Applicant  has  endured.  They  regard  Applicant  as  honest,
trustworthy, and patriotic. She is also kind, loyal, caring, and dependable, and she has a
moral character. (AE L, AE M)
