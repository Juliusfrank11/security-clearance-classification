The SOR alleges under Guideline G (SOR ¶ 1), and cross-alleges under Guideline
J (SOR ¶ 2.a) and Guideline E (SOR ¶ 4.b) that Applicant was convicted of driving under
the  influence  (DUI)  or  operating  under  the  influence  (OUI)  offenses  committed  in  July
2013  (SOR ¶ 1.b), April 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.c), and August 2015  (SOR ¶ 1.d). Also under
Guideline G, Applicant allegedly consumed alcohol at times to excess and to intoxication
since about 2013 to at least December 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.a); was separated from the Army
National Guard Reserve (ARNG) because of his alcohol-related offenses; and received
treatment from November 2015 to January 2016 for diagnosed addictive disorder-alcohol
abuse and attention deficit disorder (SOR ¶ 1.f) and from February 2016 to April 2016 for
substance abuse and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (SOR ¶ 1.g).
The   SOR  alleges  under  Guideline   H  (SOR  ¶   3.a),  and   cross-alleges  under
Guideline  J  (SOR ¶  2.b), that  Applicant  used  cocaine  with  varying  frequency  from  about
September  2013   to   at  least  September  2015   while   granted   access  to   classified
information  (SOR ¶  3.b).  His use  of cocaine  while  granted  access  to  classified  information
was also cross-alleged  under  Guideline  E  (SOR ¶  4.a).  Also  under Guideline  E,  Applicant
allegedly   falsified   his  June   30,  2018   Electronic  Questionnaires  for  Investigations
Processing   (hereafter  SF  86)  by   responding   negatively   to   inquiries  concerning   any
delinquency  regarding  routine  accounts  (SOR  ¶  4.c). Under Guideline  F, the  SOR alleges
that   Applicant owed,  as  of   May   21,  2021,  three   charged-off   debts for $24,833   (SOR  ¶
5.a), $  830  (SOR ¶ 5.b), and  $53  (SOR ¶ 5.i); and  eight  collection debts for $185  (SOR ¶
5.c), $572  (SOR ¶  5.d), $1,493  (SOR ¶  5.e), $619  (SOR ¶  5.f), $1,188  (SOR ¶  5.g), $567
(SOR ¶ 5.h), $3,923 (SOR ¶ 5.j), and $469 (SOR ¶ 5.k).
When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted all of the allegations but indicated
that he did not intentionally falsify his SF 86. Applicant asserted that he had abstained
from alcohol since December 5, 2019; that he sought help for his depression and is on
mental-health  medications;  and  that  he  had  paid  off  some  of  the  delinquent  debts,
including the debt in SOR ¶ 5.a.
Applicant’s admissions to abusing alcohol and committing drunk-driving offenses;
to receiving treatment for the diagnosed conditions; and to having owed the delinquent
debts are accepted and incorporated as findings of fact. After considering the pleadings,
exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 35-year-old high school graduate with some online college study.
(GE  1.)  He  has  never  married,  but  he  has  had  a  cohabitant  girlfriend  for  the  past  five
years.  She  has  two  children,  ages  17  and  20,  who  live  with  them.  (Tr.  29,  32,  81.)
Applicant has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since about June
2017. (GE 1.)
Applicant enlisted in the ARNG at age 17 in April 2004 (Tr. 32-33), and he served
until February 2016, when he was granted a general discharge under honorable conditions
because he had tested positive for cocaine and alcohol in a routine ARNG screening. (Tr.
35.) He appealed the character of his discharge, and it was later changed to honorable
based on his military service record. (GE 2; AE B; Tr. 35-36.) He was activated twice to
combat duty: from May 2006 through April 2007 and from July 2008 to May 2009. (AE B;
Tr. 33.) He was granted a security clearance shortly before his second deployment. (Tr.
34.) On his return from active duty, he worked full time for his state’s ARNG, which included
a deployment overseas from October 2012 to August 2013. (AE C.) In September 2013,
he lost his full-time job with the ARNG. He indicated on his June 2018 SF 86 that funding
for  his  full-time  position  with  the  ARNG  ran  out,  but  his  medical  records  from  the  VA
indicate that his job loss was because of his July 2013 DUI. (AE C.)
Substance Use  and Treatment
Applicant  drank  alcohol  in  high  school  “at  a  party  here  or  there.”  (Tr.  36.)  His
drinking to excess started in the summer of 2007. After he returned from being deployed,
he initially consumed alcohol in quantity of 30 beers and 750 ml of liquor per week. (AE
C.) He eventually moderated his consumption to social drinking, about twice a week, until
about April 2013. After he and his then-fiancée called off their relationship three months
before  they  were  to  marry  (Tr.  37),  he  began  to  turn  to  alcohol,  often  nightly,  to  self-
medicate for mental-health issues. (AE C; Tr. 25.)
After drinking four to five alcohol drinks while out at a casino with family members
one evening in July 2013, Applicant was stopped by police for swerving. He failed field
sobriety  tests  and  was  arrested  for  DUI.  He  pled  guilty,  was  granted  accelerated
rehabilitation,  placed  on  probation,  and  ordered  to  complete  100  hours  of  community
service and alcohol counseling. The charge was dismissed after he completed the terms.
(GE 2.)
Applicant’s July 2013 DUI was a factor in him losing his full-time job with the ARNG
around September 2013. He drank 750 ml of vodka per night early that winter before his
family intervened in January 2014, and he attended a two-week alcohol program. (AE C.)
From March 2014 to November 2014, he worked as a part-time bartender. (GEs 1, 2.) He
drank  alcohol  at  times  to  excess  and  used  cocaine  intermittently  in  combination  with
alcohol in that job. (Tr. 26, 44.) He used cocaine as the drug helped him sober up more
quickly from drinking. He found that the drug helped him drink more. (Tr. 42.)
Applicant consumed five to six alcohol drinks and three to four shots of liquor on
April  18,  2014,  while  talking  with  patrons  and  then  cleaning up  with  his manager  after
closing the bar. While driving home, he was stopped by the police, who smelled alcohol
on his breath. He failed a breathalyzer and was arrested for  DUI. (GEs 1-2.) Available
records from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) indicate a re-arrest date of October
25, 2014; a disposition date of January 14, 2015; and a sentence of  six months in jail,
suspended, a $500 fine, one year of probation, and 100 hours of community service. (GE
6.)
Applicant was seen at a VA health center in May 2014 and referred to the facility’s
substance-abuse  clinic.  He  reported  an  escalation  of  alcohol  use  following  two
deployments and use of alcohol to avoid his mental-health problems. A toxicology screen
of  May  8,  2014  was  positive  for  cocaine.  While  attending  substance-abuse  outpatient
programs  at  the  VA  between  July  2014  and  September  2014,  he  continued  to  drink
alcohol once a week, about two to four drinks each time. His drinking adversely affected
his relationship with his family between April 2014 and February 2015. (AE C.)
Applicant was unemployed from about November 2014 to June 2015. He was not
engaged  in  any  substance-abuse  treatment  nor  seeing  a  psychiatrist  during  that  time.
(GE  1;  AE  C;  Tr.  25.)  On  March  6,  2015,  he  presented  at  a  VA  clinic  for  a  medical
screening for a research study. He showed signs of mild intoxication, and he reported a
history of  consuming two to three alcohol drinks per day. He described his drinking as
“out of control” in the recent past. He was advised to abstain from alcohol. (AE B.)
Applicant worked for a home-improvement retailer from April 2015 to August 2015.
He  told the VA in 2015  that he had been  sober, but he  subsequently admitted  in  May
2016 that he had been drinking the entire time. (AE C.) In August 2015, he started working
as a manager at a bar. (GE 1.) In addition to using alcohol, he used cocaine on occasion
to at least November 22, 2015. (GE 2; AE C.) He reported during a psychiatric consult at
the VA in May 2016 that he had “hired his cocaine dealer” when he managed the bar so
that he and his staff would have access to the drug “as needed.” At times, he slept on a
sofa at work and was late to his drill weekend because of drinking. (AE C.)
On August 31, 2015, Applicant crashed his scooter in route home after consuming
five to six alcohol drinks with a friend on the friend’s boat. He was charged with DUI and
with probation violation (two counts). (GE 6.) He testified that he was charged with being
a two-time first offender for the April 2014 and August 2015 DUIs in that he faced one
DUI charge for the August 2015 offense with the ramifications of two DUIs. (Tr. 38.) FBI
records show that, on April 27, 2016, he was convicted of  the August 2015 DUI and of
the violation of probation charges. On May 4, 2016, he was sentenced on the DUI charge
to six months in jail, one year of probation, and a $500 fine. He had to serve only ten days
in jail as the court accepted his attendance at a substance-abuse treatment program in
lieu of jail time. He was sentenced on the probation violation counts to two days in jail for
each  offense,  to  serve  concurrently.  (GE  6;  AE  C.)  He  was  also  required  to  have  an
interlock-type device in his vehicle. (GE 2; Tr. 28.) He testified that he fulfilled the terms
of his sentence, and the device was removed. (Tr. 78.)
On  September  17,  2015,  Applicant  went  to  a  VA  mental-health  clinic  seeking
substance-abuse  treatment.  He  reported  some  anxiety  and  exhibited  some  signs  of
minimization of the harm drinking had caused him. He reported drinking “only six drinks”
before his August 2015 DUI. He was placed on a trial dose of Lexapro and referred to an
outpatient alcohol and substance abuse program. (AE C.)
During a follow-up visit with his treating psychiatrist at his local VA clinic on October
19,  2015,  Applicant  reported  he  had  completed  seven  sessions  of  substance-abuse
treatment and had abstained from alcohol. He was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder
and PTSD (rule out), and was continued on Lexapro. (AE C.)
Applicant  quit  working  at  the  bar  in  November  2015  to  focus  on  his  alcohol
rehabilitation.  (GE  1.)  On  November  23,  2015,  he  went  to  a  VA  medical  center’s
psychiatric emergency department accompanied by his ARNG supervisor. Applicant had
been  late  to  a  military  drill  because  of  intoxication,  after  having  consumed  a  gallon  of
alcohol. He reported binge drinking of six to eight beers plus 750 ml of vodka or rum every
three weeks and consumption of lesser amounts several times per week, to as recently
as November 20, 2015. He complained of symptoms of PTSD and requested substance-
abuse treatment. He was admitted for observation for 23 hours, and was diagnosed with
alcohol use disorder (binge pattern) and PTSD.  Assessed as psychiatrically stable, he
was discharged on November 24, 2015, for immediate admission to a private inpatient
alcohol-treatment facility for alcohol detoxification. The records from that private treatment
facility were not submitted in evidence, but the VA records show that he was discharged
from the inpatient facility on December 1, 2015. (AE C.)
While residing in a sober-housing situation, Applicant received follow-up recovery-
support treatment in a VA intensive outpatient program (IOP) from December 2, 2015, to
December 23, 2015, for diagnosed alcohol use disorder (severe) and PTSD. In reviewing
his  options  for  follow-up  care  with  his  recovery  support  team  on  December  17,  2015,
Applicant expressed a desire to continue individual therapy to address his negative life
experiences, as his felt his alcohol and drug use stemmed from “defective ability to cope.”
He did not believe group substance-abuse treatment would be helpful to him, although
medical records show that he had demonstrated active listening skills in group sessions.
He  was  discharged  on  December  23,  2015,  to  follow-up  with  counseling  until  a  dual-
diagnosis  program  became  available,  and  to  continue  with  his  VA  psychiatrist.  At
discharge, Applicant indicated that he was “considerably” confident in his ability to abstain
from alcohol and drugs. He denied any cravings to use alcohol or drugs in the prior 30
days. (AE C.)
During a session with his VA psychiatrist on January 12, 2016, Applicant reported
that he had abstained from alcohol for 50 days with no cravings. On January 26, 2016,
he  was  determined  to  be  not  a  good  candidate  for  a  certain  dual-diagnosis  program
because  his  medical  record  did  not  adequately  support  the  PTSD  diagnosis.  He  was
accepted into another program through the VA to start on May 26, 2016, or earlier, if a
slot became available. (AE C.)
Applicant agreed to participate in  a once-weekly continuing care program at the
VA,  but  he  never  started  the  program.  He  told  the  VA  he  was  on  active-duty  orders
through February 23, 2016, and was unable to attend. In lieu of that program, he attended
individual  therapy  outside  the  VA  setting.  His  therapist  advised  the  VA  that,  after  six
weeks  of  therapy,  she  considered  Applicant  to  be  in  the  “pre-contemplative  stage”
regarding  his  drinking  and  in  some  denial.  VA  records  show  that  Applicant  consumed
alcohol on at least February 14, 2016. (AE C.)
On March 4, 2016, Applicant was admitted to a six-week specialized inpatient dual-
diagnosis  program  at  a  VA  facility  for  diagnosed  alcohol  dependence  and  PTSD.  A
breathalyzer  test  on  admission  was  negative  for any  alcohol.  Applicant  interacted  well
with peers and staff and attended all groups and classes with good participation. Clinical
opinion was positive for Applicant’s development of goals toward an overall improvement
in his lifestyle and his challenges. He was discharged as scheduled on April 15, 2016,
with a plan to continue cognitive behavioral therapy with his private therapist.  During a
psychiatric visit at the VA on April 19, 2016, Applicant reported that he had maintained
sobriety. (AE C.)
On May 16, 2016, Applicant was assessed at the VA to see if an increase in his
service-connected disability was warranted due to his mental-health issues. He reported
no alcohol consumption since February 14, 2016, and was diagnosed, in part, with PTSD
and alcohol use disorder, severe, in early remission. (AE C.)
Applicant became employed as a clerk at a gas station in June 2016. He was fired
in March 2017 for a violation of his employer’s policies unrelated to drinking. (GEs 1-2.)
Applicant then held a part-time job in maintenance for a daycare facility until he started
his current employment in June 2017. (GE 1.) He denies any drinking around that time,
but admits that he did not take his recovery as seriously as he should have. (Tr. 26.-27.)
After not drinking for approximately 18 months (AE C), he began drinking socially, “a drink
now  and  then  at  dinner,”  in  the  summer  of  2017.  (Tr.  47.)  Applicant  thought  he  could
control his drinking. (Tr. 50.)
On his June 2018 SF 86, Applicant disclosed that he received treatment for PTSD
for  about  two  months  in  2016.  He  listed  his three  DUIs  and  one  violation  of  probation
offense. Concerning an SF 86 inquiry into whether his use of alcohol had any negative
impact on his work performance, professional or personal relationships, his finances, or
resulted in law enforcement intervention, Applicant indicated that, in addition to the DUIs,
alcohol caused him problems between September 2013 and September 2015 in that his
relationships  with  family and  friends  suffered.  He  disclosed  that  he had  participated  in
alcohol-rehabilitation programs at the VA between November 2015 and January 2016.
(GE 1.)
In  response  to  an  SF  86  illegal  drug  inquiry,  he  reported  that  he  used  cocaine
infrequently and only when drinking between September 2013 and September 2016. He
responded affirmatively to an SF 86 inquiry into whether his drug use occurred when he
possessed a  security clearance.  He explained  that he self-medicated  with  alcohol and
sometimes cocaine when he was in a “rough place” in his life, but that he had checked
himself  into  rehabilitation,  was  taking  medications  to  control  his  PTSD,  and  going  to
support groups for his PTSD.  He  added that he  had  ended  all ties to  people  who  use
illegal drugs and drink heavily, and he denied any intention of returning to that lifestyle.
(GE 1.)
On  August  10,  2018,  Applicant  had  a  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  with  an
authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He related that
he  was  drinking  alcohol,  despite  previous  treatment  for  alcohol  use.  He  described  his
current  consumption  as  one  or  two  drinks  per  month  at  family  functions,  usually
celebrations, which he did not consider to be abusive. He stated  that he  would “never”
again consume alcohol to the point where it impacted him negatively. (GE 2.)
As for his cocaine use, Applicant recalled during his PSI that he last used cocaine
around September 2015 and not September 2016. He stated that he used cocaine about
five times, in bar settings, while he held a security clearance. He denied any intention to
use  cocaine  in  the  future  because  of  his  “current  career”  and  stated  that  he  had  no
ongoing association with individuals who use the drug. (GE 2.) Applicant now asserts that
his  cocaine  use  occurred  between  September  2014  and  September  2015,  when  a
positive drug screen for cocaine led to his discharge from the ARNG in February 2016.
(Tr. 41.) VA records show he tested positive for cocaine on May 18, 2014, and again on
November 22, 2015. (AE C.) He now recalls that he first used cocaine on his birthday in
March 2014 and last used cocaine before he entered the dual-diagnosis program, which
VA records show started on March 4, 2016. (AE C; Tr. 44) He told the clinicians in the
dual-diagnosis program that he last used cocaine on November 22, 2015. The evidence
substantiates  that  he  used  cocaine  on  occasion  between  March  2014  and  at  least
November 2015 rather than from September 2013 to September 2015 as reported on his
SF 86, or from September 2014 to September 2015 as stated during his PSI.
Applicant’s  drinking  eventually  progressed  to  every  other  day  after  work.  He
testified at his hearing that it was not that he lacked control over his drinking at that time,
but  he  “thought  it  was  on  that  path.”  (Tr.  47-49.)  On  December  5,  2019,  Applicant
contacted his VA psychiatrist and reported that “the drinking started back up” and that his
mental-health  medications  were  ineffective.  He  had  not  been  taking  his  psychiatric
medications. (AE B.)
On December 10, 2019, Applicant voluntarily sought treatment in the psychiatric
emergency room  at  the  VA for his alcohol use  disorder.  He felt  that  he  could  not  stop
drinking on his own and could not safely undergo detoxification at home. (Tr. 49-50.) He
was admitted overnight for observation prior to entering a substance-abuse day program.
A drug screen of December 10, 2019, detected no presence of illegal drugs. He reported
a last use of  cocaine some four years prior, but recent use of alcohol to a last use on
December 5, 2019. He described his drinking as “getting out of hand.” He used alcohol
to address issues of insomnia and anxiety, and reported consuming two bottles of vodka
every two to three days preceding his last use. He was discharged to a recovery-support
program  on December 11, 2019, with a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder.  He was not
accepted for admission to a higher level of residential treatment as clinical opinion was
that his needs could be met at the lower level of care. (AE B.)
Applicant  attended  a  recovery-support  program,  which  included  group  day
sessions  starting  December  12,  2019,  in  the  same  substance-abuse  rehabilitation
program  he  had  attended  in  2015.  He  was  diagnosed  with  alcohol  dependence,
uncomplicated.  His  family  and  friends  were  supportive  of  his  recovery,  and  he  felt
extremely confident throughout treatment that he would not use alcohol or illegal drugs.
Initially, he reported that he was slightly bothered by cravings or urges to use alcohol. He
attended  and  participated  in  all  aspects  of  the  program,  including  group  sessions  of
December  17,  2019,  in  which  the  importance  of  medication  compliance  was  stressed,
and  December  30.  2019,  in  which  attending  self-help  meetings  after  discharge  was
encouraged.  He  remained  abstinent  from  alcohol  and  illegal  drugs,  as  confirmed  by
negative urine screens and breathalyzer tests. Clinicians assessed him as able to identify
and discuss triggers and urges, and having developed good coping skills to avoid relapse.
Applicant requested to follow up the program in an evening IOP outside the VA network.
At discharge to his home on January 6, 2020, he was referred to a community resource
for assistance with securing an IOP. He also planned to see his private therapist and his
psychiatrist at the local VA primary-care clinic. (AE B.)
During a January 7, 2020 session with his VA psychiatrist, Applicant reported that
he  had  become  complacent  with  social  alcohol  use  and  so  took  action  to  stop  using
alcohol.  He  expressed his intention  to  pursue  an  evening  IOP  and denied  any current
cravings or urges to use alcohol. Concerning his mental-health medications, he admitted
that he had discontinued taking his Depakote on his own. He was continued on Adderall
and cleared to return to work. (AE B.)
Applicant testified that he attended an IOP three nights per week for two months.
(Tr. 27, 51.) Records of that program are not in evidence. In response to interrogatories,
on  January  21,  2021,  Applicant  stated  that  his  alcohol  and  drug  use  was  “more  of  an
escape from underlying PTSD issue.” He indicated that he was “seeking counseling for
mental health due to PTSD still.” (GE 2.)
On July 27, 2020, Applicant was diagnosed by the VA with adult attention deficit
hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD).  He  currently  takes  bupropion  for  a  mood  disorder
diagnosed in February 2021 and Ritalin for his ADHD. (AEs B-C; Tr. 79.) He is currently
on a maintenance schedule where he sees his VA-appointed psychiatrist every two or
three  months.  He  is  not  currently  receiving  therapy  from  a  therapist.  He  last  saw  the
private  therapist  in  Spring  2021,  and  he  has  been  looking  for  a  new  therapist  without
success. (Tr. 51, 84.) He has requested an appointment with his VA psychiatrist because
of  increased  depression  over  the  last  month.  (Tr.  80.)  Notwithstanding  his  history  of
drinking  to  self-medicate  mental-health  issues,  he  does  not  believe  he  is  at  risk  of
relapsing into alcohol. (Tr. 80.)
Applicant is not  involved  in any  self-help  meetings such  as  Alcoholics Anonymous
(AA), but he  has participated  about once  a  week in  an  online  program  Smart Recovery,
which he states instructs on “more  modern coping skills and  techniques.” (Tr. 52-53.) He
signed  onto  Smart Recovery  in January  2020. (Tr. 53.)  He  denies any  consumption  of
alcohol since  December 5, 2019, and  any  intention  to  drink alcohol in the future. (Tr. 27-
28.)  His girlfriend  and  family  are his primary  support system. (Tr. 53.)  He testified  that his
job is also a significant deterrent to relapse. (Tr. 81.)
Finances
Applicant’s finances began to suffer around 2014 and 2015, when he was drinking
heavily.  He  testified  that  all  of  his  money  went  to  fight  cancer.  (Tr.  54.)  Available  VA
records  do  not  show a  cancer diagnosis (AEs  B-C),  and  he  presented  no  evidence of
medical payments. Periods of unemployment were a factor in him being unable to meet
some of his expenses. (Tr. 54.)
Applicant  responded  affirmatively  on  his  June  2018  SF  86  to  inquiries  into  any
delinquency involving enforcement. He listed one debt of $20,000, for which his pay was
garnished. At the time, he believed it was a credit-card debt, but he recalled during his
August 2018 PSI that it was a car-loan deficiency balance. (GE 2.) About steps to satisfy
the debt, he indicated on his SF 86, “I had no clue about it. . . talking with lawyer to get it
resolved  sooner.”  He  answered  “No”  to  the  SF  86  questions  about  any  delinquency
involving  routine  accounts,  but  added,  “Besides  previously  stated  not  that  I  can
remember.” (GE 1.)
As  of  July  14,  2018,  Applicant’s  credit  report  (GE  5)  showed  the  delinquent
accounts listed in SOR ¶¶ 5.a.-5.j. As of April 9, 2020 (GE 4), his credit report showed an
additional  delinquency  (SOR  ¶  5.k).  The  delinquency  and  payment  histories  for  the
accounts are reflected in the following table:

During his August 2018 PSI, Applicant was confronted about the delinquencies on
his credit  report. About  the previously disclosed  garnishment, Applicant  stated  that his
wages were being garnished at 24% if his pay since March 2018 to recover a $20,000
deficiency balance on a  car loan  that he  thought  insurance had covered.  He  indicated
that  he  was  unaware  of  any  other delinquent  accounts,  and  when  confronted  with  the
adverse credit information on his credit report, he was unable to provide any details. He
expressed  an  intention  to  pay  off  his  legitimate  debts.  He  had  not  had  any  financial
counseling, but stated that he intended to get some help to address his debts. (GE 2.)
Applicant asserts that when  he  found  out  about  the  adverse credit  information  on
his credit record,  he  “tried  to  get one  of those  credit  consolidators and  figure it out  that
way, and  then  it  kind  of fell  off. [He] got  promoted  at work and  it wasn’t important to  [him],
so   [he]  neglected   it.”  (Tr.  55.)  In   his  January   2021   response   to   DOHA   interrogatories,
Applicant stated,  “1/2  of  all  debts  paid  and  working  with  lawyer for rest.” (GE  2.)  He  now
admits   that  it  was  not   until  he   received   the   SOR  that  he   realized   he   could  not  put   off
11
dealing with the debts any longer. (Tr. 55.) He maintains that he paid off some $30,000
in debt balances, including the car-loan debt in SOR ¶ 5.a, which was resolved through
garnishment. (Tr. 56.) He provided no documentation proving that any of the SOR debts
have been paid.
As of May 2022, Applicant was $387 past due on a $16,012 vehicle loan obtained
in August 2017. His account first became past due 30 days in December 2017. It was 90
days  past  due  in  January  2019,  December  2020,  and  January  2021.  The  loan  had  a
balance  of  $8,364  as  of  late  May  2022.  (AE  A.)  He  testified  about  the  May  2022
delinquency that his car payment was not debited properly from his bank account so the
bank rejected his payment. He paid $400 on July 4, 2022, to catch up. (Tr. 76.)
A credit-card account opened with a retailer in May 2021  was reported as being
120 days past due in February 2022, although it was current as of June 2022 with a $253
balance. A $22,122 vehicle loan cosigned by Applicant for his girlfriend in August 2017
had never been late. She made the $421 monthly payments on time and had reduced the
balance  to $6,303 as of  May 2022.  (AE A; Tr. 30.) As of  July 2022, a $148 debt from
February 2020 for his interlock device was in collection.  (AE A.) He maintains that the
debt has been paid. (Tr. 77.) As of July 2022, his credit rating was poor. (AE A.)
Applicant received a substantial increase in his salary from $68,000 to $104,000
annually on his promotion effective May 2, 2022, to a supervisory role at work. (Tr. 29,
67-68.)  As  of  his  July  2022  security  clearance  hearing,  he  was  researching  credit
specialists to resolve some of his past-due debts. (Tr. 29.) He receives a monthly disability
payment from the VA of $1,987. (Tr. 68.)
Applicant’s  cohabitant   girlfriend   is  a   paraprofessional  in  special  education   for  a
school district  during the academic school year. (Tr. 29.)  She did not finish out the  2021-
2022  school year because  of complications from  COVID she  suffered  in early  2022. (Tr.
68.)  When  she  was working, she  earned  $14.50  per hour for a  32-hour work week. (Tr.
82.)
Applicant  and  his girlfriend’s monthly  expenses  include  $2,000 for rent  (Tr. 69);
$377  and  $421  in  car  payments  (AE  A);  $100  for  Internet  service  (Tr.  70);  $89  for
cellphone service (Tr. 71); and $600 to $700 for gasoline. (Tr. 71.) He and his girlfriend
give  her  20-year-old  daughter about $200 a month for her  college expenses. She  is a
commuter student at a community college. (Tr. 82.) Applicant was recently billed $1,200
for emergency room services. (Tr. 71.) He testified that he has around $2,000 per month
available for food after paying his other obligations. (Tr. 72.) He indicated that he used
some of his discretionary income to remove five collections debts from his credit report
and to pay bills. (Tr. 72.) He has minimal savings of maybe “a couple” hundred, although
he expects his financial situation to improve with his recent increase in income. (Tr. 73.)
Applicant has  not had  any financial  counseling, even  though  he  testified  he  “definitely”
needs it. (Tr. 74.)
