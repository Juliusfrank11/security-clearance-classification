Applicant admitted the SOR allegation. Her admission is adopted as a finding of
fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  48-year-old  prospective  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  She
has  been  offered  a  position  contingent  on  holding  a  security  clearance.  That
government  contractor  is  sponsoring  her  for  a  clearance.  She  has  had  intermittent
employment since she was medically retired from the U.S. Army in 2016. She held the
rank  of  major  when  she  was  retired.  She  receives  retirement  pay  from  the  Army  of
$1,400 monthly and a disability  pension  from  the  Department  of Veterans’ Affairs (VA)
of  $692  monthly,  based  upon  a  40  percent  VA  disability  rating.  She  holds  a  master’s
degree. She recently married and has no children. (Tr. at 19, 24; GE 1)
The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file her 2013-2017 federal income
tax returns. (SOR ¶ 1.a).
Applicant  admitted  the  single  allegation  in  her  SOR  answer.  She  provided  a
variety  of  reasons  why  she  was  unable  to  timely  file  her  federal  tax  returns  for  years
2013-2017.  Those  reasons  include:  she  was  either  performing  duties  as  an  Army
reservist  or  placed  on  active  duty  orders,  which  created  pay/tax  issues  for  her;  she
rented her house out half the year, which caused tax issues; in April 2014, tax filing time
for tax year 2013, she was assigned to a task force requiring her to work 15-18 hours a
day so she did not have the time to file her taxes, but she did file for a six-month filing
extension; her tax records were stored at her home in a different state and she had little
opportunity  to  access  them;  she  had  medical  issues  involving  the  functioning  of  her
brain, a condition which was later diagnosed as multiple sclerosis, which ultimately led
to her medical retirement from the Army in 2016; she  was homeless for approximately
18 months staying with friends on occasion. (Tr. 21-24, 42-43)
Applicant received a lump-sum payment of approximately $197,000 from a family
trust  fund  in  2016  or  2017.  She  did  not  use  this  money  to  hire  an  accountant  or  tax
professional  to  prepare  her  unfiled  federal  returns  from  2013-2017.  She  claimed  to
interview several certified public accountants about her situation, but she  asserted that
despite  the  lump  sum  payment,  she  could  not  afford  to  pay  any  of  them  a  fee  of
$10,000.  She  used  the  proceeds  from  the  trust  payment  to  pay  her  mortgage
arrearages,  to  pay  medical  expense,  and  to  live  on.  That  fund  is  now  depleted.
Applicant  claimed  that  she  was  unaware  of  the  military  tax  assistance  programs
available on military bases to active duty and retired military members.  She stated that
in  2017-2018,  she  received  some  financial  counseling  assistance  from  a  group  that
works with military veterans. (Tr. 24, 26, 28-29, 60-61)
In  April  2019,  Applicant  completed
interrogatories  sent  by  DCSA  CAF
adjudicators.  As  part  of  her  response,  she  provided  wage  and  income  transcripts
obtained by her from the IRS for tax years 2013-2017. At that time, she had not filed her
federal returns for those  years. She  stated  in  her response, “I hope  to  have  all  returns
finished by December, including 2018.” Presumably, her reference to December meant
December 2019. She did not file her federal returns by her hopeful deadline. (GE 2)
As  stated   above,   the   SOR  was  issued   to   Applicant  in  February   2021.  She
testified  that  she  hired   a   tax   attorney/CPA   to   file   all   of  her unfiled  federal returns from
2013-2020. Applicant admitted  she  did  not timely  file  her federal returns for years 2018-
2020.  Since  the  unfiled   tax   returns for those   years  were  not  alleged   in  the  SOR,  I  will
not use  that evidence  for disqualification  purposes, but  I may  use  it to  assess credibility,
for  the   applicability   of  any   mitigating   conditions,  and   in  considering   the   whole-person
factors.   Applicant   presented   documentation   showing   that  her  2013   federal   return   was
filed  in August  2022  (AE  F); her 2014-2016  returns were filed  in November 2021  (AE  E,
pp. 1, 44, 89); and  her 2017 return  was filed in August 2022  (AE G).
Applicant  testified  that  she  did  not  deliberately  refuse  to  file  her  federal  tax
returns. She needed help with the task and did not get it. He medical issues impacted
her ability to complete her taxes. (Tr. 32-34, 49)
Applicant provided character letters from five colleagues and former supervisors,
including two  retired  Army major generals.  All  of  her references  state  that Applicant  is
trustworthy and reliable based upon their personal knowledge of her. They all seem to
place  the  responsibility  on  the  Army  for  not  providing  Applicant  the  proper  means  to
transition out of the service with her medical problems. This they believe ultimately led
to her tax problems. All recommend that her clearnce be continued.
