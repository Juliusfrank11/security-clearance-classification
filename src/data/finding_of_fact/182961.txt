Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.e, 1.i, and 1.k, and denied SOR ¶¶ 1.f-1.h and
1.k, each with a brief explanation. His admissions and explanations are incorporated into
the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 49  years old.  He and  his wife  have  been  married   since  2002.  They
have   two   teenage   sons.   Applicant   graduated   from  high   school   in  1991   and   joined   the
Navy. He served  in the  Navy  on  active  duty  from  1992-2001; he  then  joined  the  U.S. Army
Reserve for about a year. He then returned to active duty  with the Navy  and served  from
2003-2013  when  he  retired  as  a  petty  officer first class (E-6). He  earned  an  associate’s
degree  in 2001.  (GE 10; Tr. 17, 28, 32-35, 82)
After leaving the Navy, Applicant worked part-time and was then hired as a security
officer for another government agency (AGA). He worked there from 2013 to February
2018, when he was terminated for failing to report a traffic accident. (GE 1 at 16-17)
Applicant was on  patrol  and  pulled  out into  traffic. He  heard a  thump,  looked  back,
and   saw   a   motorcyclist  on   the   ground.  He  returned   to  the   scene  and  asked   the  driver
what had  happened. The  other driver said Applicant pulled  in front  of him. Applicant did
not agree  with  that,  but  did not argue. The  other driver was not injured. Applicant saw  the
driver’s backpack, and   thought he  was in college  and   concluded, or assumed,   that the
driver did not have  enough  money  to  afford  to  pay  for the  damage, so  he  offered  to  pay
for some  of  the  damage, including  to  the  motorcycle’s headlight.  After a  while  the  driver
reported   the   incident   to   Applicant’s  employer,  the   AGA.  Applicant  was  terminated
because  he  failed  to  report the  incident,  which occurred  while  he  was on  duty. Applicant
said he  understood  that the  offer to  pay  the  other driver looked  like  a  cover up, but that
was not his intention. “I  just  felt  bad  for him,” he  said.  Applicant considered  contesting  his
termination  but did not  have  the  financial means to  hire  legal counsel to  do  so.  (Tr.  35-
49, 62-63)
Applicant  was  briefly   unemployed   after  he   was  fired,  but  then   found   work  as  a
security  manager for $16  an  hour. (AE  T)  This was a  significant decrease  from  his  prior
salary  of  $88,000  a  year with  the  AGA.  (Tr. 41, 64,  112; GE  1) In  about January  2019, he
began   working   security   with   another  contractor,  making   an   annual  salary   in   the   mid-
$40,000s. He  was promoted  in  mid-2020,  and  his annual salary  rose  to  the  mid $70,000s.
(Tr. 112-114)
Since  January  2022,  Applicant  has  worked  as  an  information  technology  (IT)
consultant for a government contractor. He earns $30.77 an hour in that job, which is full
time. (AE U) He recently began working in security at another contractor job, for which he
also needs a clearance. He earns $21 an hour in that job, working 20-25 hours a week.
He holds a clearance now and also held a clearance in the Navy. (Tr. 12, 42-43, 112-113;
AE S)
Applicant  also  receives  $1,452  a  month  in  retirement  pay.  He  also  is  a  100%
service-connected  disabled  veteran.  He  receives  disability  pay  of  $3,746,  recently
increased from $2,800 per month. (AE N, AE O, AE P; Tr. 46-51)
Applicant testified that he first encountered financial trouble while at his last duty
station in the military, because he was not making enough money. (Tr. 34; GE 10) He
filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 in 2010, and it was discharged in 2014.
(GE 3; Tr. 30, 44) (SOR ¶ 1.a)
After leaving the Navy, Applicant began getting phone calls from creditors in 2017
He then lost income after he was terminated by the AGA and took a significant pay cut in
his next job. This led him to fall behind on his debts. He acknowledged that he did not
monitor his online bill-paying and income stream. (Tr. 29-30, 43-45, 57-61) His mortgage
payment  also  increased  from  $2,400  to  $2,600  per  month  and  he  could  not  meet  his
financial responsibilities. (Tr. 67-69; Answer; AE A) In 2017, he was offered a mortgage
modification, with monthly payments of $2,416. (AE M)
On his SCA, Applicant listed debt consolidation and various debts. (GE 1 at 43-45)
He paid the debt-consolidation firm about $180 but did not enter into an agreement with
them.  (Tr.  65-66)  In  January  2019,  Applicant  again  filed  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy
protection. He declared assets of $933,000 and liabilities of $535,000, monthly income of
$6,807  and  monthly  expenses  of  $5,581.  (GE  2  at  12)  Applicant  participated  in  credit
counseling during the bankruptcy process, as required. The bankruptcy was dismissed in
October 2019 for failure to make payments. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. 30) (SOR ¶ 1.b) He indicated
that  he  and  his  wife  could  not  afford  the  bankruptcy  plan  payments  of  $2,000.  The
bankruptcy trustee also noted that Applicant had unfiled federal income tax returns. (Tr.
68; GE 2 at 60)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  during  this  period,  from  about  August  2019  to
November  2021,  he  and  his  family  did  not  pay  their  mortgage.  Due  to  a  federal
moratorium on evictions, the family remained in the home. (Tr. 69-70) In November 2021,
they moved into a rental property. (Tr. 30. 69-70) Applicant asserted that the home they
owned was foreclosed on, but he did not owe anything to the mortgage company because
he surrendered the house. (Tr. 103) Applicant has been current on his rental payments
of $2,300 a month since December 2021, including a $4,400 security deposit. (AE E)
In  January  2022,  Applicant  cashed  out  his  401k  retirement  (about  $11,000)  to
address his debts. He said he has between $400 and $700 at the end of each month after
paying the household expenses. He has little to no savings currently. He tries to keep a
budget but does not have a formal one. He did pursue credit counseling and budgeting
from Navy Relief. He was advised to declare bankruptcy, which he did in 2019. He said
his financial issues were generally attributable to falling behind on his bills trying to provide
for his family. (Tr. 51-55) Applicant hopes to be debt free by the end of 2023. (Tr. 31, 101)
SOR ¶ 1.c ($35,850) is a student loan account placed for collection. (GE 8, 9) The
loans  date  back  to  at  least  2001,  when  he  earned  his  associate’s  degree,  and  were
delinquent by 2004, when he owed almost $21,000 in past-due student loans. (GE 10;
Tr. 86) They became delinquent again in about 2014. He thought they were covered in
his bankruptcy discharge but they were not. He said he made partial payments until about
2018 when he lost his job. Applicant made $5 monthly payments from January 2021 to
May 2021 so he could be considered for deferred payment. (Tr. 82-89) The student loan
is now with a different creditor, and payments are deferred until June 2022. (Answer; GE
6; AE A; Tr. 77, 107-109) He will soon be required to pay $108 per month. (AE V)
SOR ¶ 1.d ($10,071) is a home improvement account, opened in 2015, now placed
for collection. He now owes $10,359 (GE 6, 7, 8, 9) He has a payment plan in place for
$200 monthly payments, to start in July 2022. He says he owes only $2,100. (Answer; Tr.
27, 89-92; AE A, AE I, AE V) Applicant mistakenly relies on AE I to conclude that he owes
only  $2,150  on  this  delinquent  debt;  however,  AE  I  relates  to  a  different  home
improvement company. They are different accounts, and SOR ¶ 1.d is unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.e ($4,026) is a charged-off debt to a bank. (GE 6, 7, 8, 9) Applicant said
he called the creditor in January or February 2022 and made a few payments before then.
He has a payment plan in place for $250 a month starting July 2022 and the total amount
owed is $3,772. (Answer; AE A; AE B, AE V; Tr. 92-93)
SOR ¶¶ 1.f ($1,863) and 1.h ($2,452) are debts charged off by a credit union. (GE
6, 8, 9) Applicant set up a payment plan to pay off the two accounts and said they were
paid off in January 2022. He provided no receipts but credit reports show a zero balance.
(Answer; AE A, AE V; Tr. 93) These accounts are resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.g ($263) is a medical debt placed for collection. (GE 8) The account has
been paid. (AE C; Tr. 95-96)
SOR ¶ 1.i ($5,778) and SOR 1.j. ($2,877) are two judgments filed entered against
Applicant  in  favor  of  an  HOA,  in  2020  and  2016  respectively.  (GE  4;  GE  5)  Applicant
indicated that he initiated a payment plan to resolve both HOA judgments in April 2022.
(AE A) He paid $1,000 in April 2022 and $200 in May 2022 (AE D) Applicant asserts it is
one  debt,  not  two,  and  believes  he  owes  around  $7,000  total.  (Tr.  96-101)  His  post-
hearing documentation did not include any additional payments since May 2022. (AE V)
SOR ¶ 1.k concerns Applicant’s 2017 federal income tax return, unfiled as of the
date of the SOR amendment. Applicant knew that tax returns are usually due by April 15
of the following year. (Tr. 70-71) His 2017 tax returns were unfiled at the time he filed his
2019 bankruptcy, as noted. Applicant and his wife take their tax returns to a  nationally
known tax preparer. They did not alert them that he was late on his tax filing. (Tr. 79)
Applicant  did  not  file  the  returns  on  time  (by  April  2018)  because  of  his  recent
termination (February 2018). (Tr. 75) He said he filed his 2017 returns in April 2020. (Tr.
72-74) Post-hearing documentation from his tax preparer shows that his 2017 state and
federal returns were prepared at that time. Applicant owed $4,145 in federal income taxes
and $114 in state income taxes for tax year 2017. (AE H at 18) There is no evidence that
Applicant has paid or is paying these delinquent taxes. He said he had no other unfiled
returns and no other delinquent federal or state taxes. (Tr. 70-82)
According to his 2019 bankruptcy petition, Applicant has several other debts, some
of which remain unpaid and unresolved, since the bankruptcy was dismissed. Applicant
asserted that he had paid some, and did not recognize others. The bankruptcy petition
was filed jointly with his wife. (Tr. 101-107; GE 2)
Applicant  was  recognized  in  February  2020  with  an  award  at  work.  (AE  K)  He
achieved excellence or exceeded expectations in an earlier performance evaluation, from
2016-2017. (AE L) Applicant’s references attest to his reliability, professional judgment,
his value as an asset to his employer, and to the importance he places on his family. (AE
Q, AE R)
Applicant  understands  the  security  significance  of  his  financial  history  of  late
payments due to mismanagement and loss of employment. He is working to address his
debts. He has reduced his spending, set a budget, and set up repayment plans. He takes
pride in his prior military service and wants to continue to serve the country. (AE V)
