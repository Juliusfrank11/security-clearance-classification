Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.h, and 1.j and 1.k.
He denied SOR ¶ 1.i. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated  into  the  findings of  fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 39  years old.  He earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in 2006. He married  in
2012  and  divorced  in 2017. He has a  child, age  eight,  from  the  marriage. He remarried  in
2019   and   has   an   infant  child   and   a   six-year-old  stepchild.   Applicant  began   his   current
$120,000.  At his previous job, from
employment in  August 2022  and  his annual salary is
February   2022   to   August  2022,   his   annual   salary   was  $116,000.   From   March  2020   to
February  2022  he  earned  $110,000  annually  and  from  November 2017  to  February  2020
he earned $95,000  annually.  (Transcript (Tr.) 15-22, 79-80; GE  1)
Applicant partially  attributes his financial difficulties to  his  May  2017  divorce.  He
received  the  marital house  and  was required  to  sell  it  as part of  the  divorce settlement,
splitting  the  profit,  if there was any.  In  addition,  he  initially  was required  to  pay  $1,040  a
month  for child  support,  which he  found  difficult to  pay. The  child  support payment was
modified in May 2020,  and  he now pays $400 a month. The  divorce decree required  him
to  file  his 2017 income  tax return as single.  (Tr. 16-17; AE  A, L)
Applicant met his second wife in 2018 and moved in with her in June 2018. He still
owned the marital house from his divorce and was responsible for the mortgage payments
and  other  monthly expenses  associated  with  it.  He  stated  his financial  problems  were
beyond his control because he had two mortgages to pay. He was not legally responsible
for paying her mortgage. He testified that because he was living with her, he felt obligated
to help pay her mortgage. From June 2018, he paid her mortgage of approximately $800,
along with his mortgage payment of $1,200. He sold his marital residence in May 2019
and  there  was  a  $4,000  deficiency.  He  borrowed  money  from  his  father  to  pay  the
deficiency. He repaid him in September 2019. (Tr. 22-28; AE C, G)
Applicant’s  wife   was  on   leave   through   the   Family   &   Medical   Leave   Act  (FMLA)
from  October 2020  to  January  2021. Applicant  testified  that she  earned  partial pay  during
this period. She  later was on  eight  weeks leave  from  her job  due  to  pregnancy  from  June
to  August  2022.  Applicant testified  that she  earned  60% of  her income  during  this time.
She  went  back  to  work recently. Her annual income  is approximately  $55,000.  (Tr. 20-22;
AE E, F)
Applicant purchased   a   motorcycle  after his divorce.  When  he  moved   in   with   his
second  wife,  he  was unable  to  make  the  $150  monthly  payments  on  the  loan  (SOR ¶  1.e-
$8,034).  The   account   went  into   collection   status,   and   Applicant  resolved   the   debt   in
October 2021   with   a   lump-sum   payment.   He   then   sold   the  motorcycle  for   $3,200   after
paying  the  loan.  Applicant provided  documentary  proof  the  debt is resolved. (Tr. 28-32,
66-67; AE  O)
The   debts  alleged   in  SOR  ¶¶  1.f   ($5,319),  1.g   ($26,097)  and   1.h   ($4,827)  are
charged-off  credit card debts. Applicant had  difficulty  paying  these  debts when  he  started
helping  his wife  with  her mortgage  payments.  He contacted  the  creditor in SOR ¶  1.g  and
requested  it  lower the  interest  rate.  He testified  that he  did not follow  up  with  the  creditor
because  he  then  contacted  a  debt consolidation  company  to  assist  him  in resolving  his
debts   and   was  advised   not  to   contact  his  creditors  and   to   stop   making   payments.  He
provided   a   copy   of  the   contract  that   he   signed   in  November   2017,  which  indicated   his
monthly  payments on  the  $42,636  amount of  unsecured  debt was $638  a  month. He said
he made  about  six  to  nine  months  of  payments, but then  stopped.  He testified  that he
likely  had  missed  monthly  payments to  these  creditors  before the  advice from  the  debt
consolidation   company.   Applicant   did   not  provide   corroborating   documents   of  his
payments  to  the  debt consolidation  company. He did not contact the  other creditors.  He
has not taken  any  other action  on  these  debts to  resolve  them  since  then.  These  debts
have  been  delinquent  since  at least May  2019.  Applicant testified  that he  paid  the  debt in
SOR ¶  1.i ($261). He did not provide  documentary  evidence  this debt is resolved. (Tr. 45-
46, 50-54, 68-70;  GE  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, AE U)
Applicant’s wife  has a  car note  for a  2017  vehicle. He recently  purchased  a  2020
vehicle  because  they  needed  a  bigger car that could hold  three  car seats.  He testified
that he is unfamiliar with his wife’s finances. (Tr. 46-49, 74-79; GE 6)
Applicant’s  wife   sold  her  house   in   September  2021,  and   she   and   Applicant
purchased  a  new  house  and  made  a  cash  down  payment of $30,000  to  $35,000. She
made  a  profit of  about  $45,000  on  the  house. They  used  the  remainder of  the  profit  for
home  improvements.  He testified  that after paying  for the  home  improvements,  he  did not
have   any   extra   money   to   pay   his  other  delinquent  debts,   including   his  tax   debt.  Their
current mortgage payment is approximately $2,000. (Tr. 71-74; GE 6)
Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  2017  and  2018  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns. He was indebted to the IRS for delinquent taxes in the approximate amount of
$2,738 for tax year 2016 and $655 for tax year 2019.
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in August  2019. He told
the investigator that he was financially unable to pay his 2016 federal income taxes, but
would do so by the end of 2020. He discussed his failure to timely file his 2017 and 2018
federal  income  tax  returns.  He  said  he  had  an  appointment  with  a  tax  professional  in
September 2019 to assist him in filing both his state and federal tax returns and any taxes
owed would be paid in full by the end of 2020. Applicant also acknowledged the delinquent
accounts alleged in the SOR. He told the investigator that he had not made an effort to
pay them, but understood he was obligated to do so. He intended to contact the creditors
to negotiate payment plans and he intended to eventually pay the balances owed. (GE 2)
Applicant  testified   that   he   used   the   proceeds  from   the   sale   of  his  motorcycle
($3,200)  to   pay   his  tax   debt.   He   provided   an   IRS   document  that  showed   a   history   of
payments. It  reported  that in April 2020  a  state  income  tax  levy  of  $641  was paid for tax
year 2016;  in January  2021  a  $656  payment was applied  to  a  federal tax  debt  for tax  year
2019; in September 2021  a  $405  payment was applied  to  a  federal tax  debt for tax  year
2020,  and  $2,748  was applied  to  a federal tax  debt for tax  year 2016. (Tr. 32,  42-45,  64-
65; AE K)
Applicant testified that he failed to timely file his 2017 and 2018 federal and state
tax returns because after his divorce he let it slip, and he should have taken care of it. He
delayed further because he said the cost of having the returns completed by a tax service
was a hindrance. He said he could not afford the $500 it would cost. He said his wife was
pregnant and not working. (Tr. 32-37; AE D, G, H, I, J)
Applicant  testified  that  he filed  his 2017  and  2018 federal and  state  income  tax
returns  the  last  week  of  August  2022,  shortly  before  his hearing.  He  provided  the  first
page  of  the  state  tax  form  for  each  year,  but  it  does  not  show  that  he  signed  the
documents and the date they were submitted. He said he could not file electronically. The
2017 state form shows he owes $962 and the 2018 state form shows he was due a $702
refund. He testified he has not paid what he owes. (Tr. 33-45, 64; AE D, G, H, I, J)
Applicant also provided the first page of his 2017 and two pages of his 2018 IRS
1040 forms. He did not provide evidence that he signed the documents, and the date he
submitted them to the IRS. The 2018 federal form shows he is owed a $523 refund. He
did not provide the same page for his 2017 federal tax form, which would show that he
was due a refund or had a tax debt. Applicant testified that he owes $9,500 for federal
income  tax  for  tax  year  2017.  He  said  that  he  will  likely  not  receive  the  2018  federal
income tax refund because it is beyond the three-year period to claim it. He said that he
filed his 2019 federal income tax return and owed taxes, but was unable to pay it until
January 2021. He filed his 2020 federal income tax return, and he received a refund, but
could not recall the amount. He filed his 2021 federal income tax return and owes $1,484
that has not been paid. He has not contacted the IRS to make payment arrangements for
any of his delinquent taxes.1
Post-hearing,  Applicant  provided   an   email   stating   he   was  unable  to   obtain
verification  from  the  IRS  website  that his 2017  and  2018  tax  returns have  been  received.
The  response  email  stated  that the  IRS  had  notified  Applicant by  mail  that his 2017  tax
return should  have  been  filed  and  was not.  It  said it  could  take  up  to  six  weeks to  process
returns and  that he  should include  with  his return any  payment due  and  if  he  could not
pay the  full amount to  pay what he could and apply for a payment plan. Applicant did not
provide  evidence  post-hearing  that he  has made  any  payments to  the  IRS. (Tr. 33-45,  64-
65; AE G, H, R, T, V, W)
testified
that  his
Applicant
financial  problems  are  due
to  extenuating
circumstances.  They  are  his  2017  divorce,  child  support,  his  wife  not  earning  her  full
salary while on medical leave, a new baby, and assuming her mortgage payments and
her other financial responsibilities. He testified that he and his wife are working through
the  Dave  Ramsey  financial  program,  which  they  started  in  the  summer  of  2021,  but
because his wife was out of work they have not been able to pay much. He said he has
a good plan moving forward. He said his failure to file his income tax returns was due to
his divorce. (Tr. 46)
The SOR allegations are corroborated by Applicant’s testimony, admissions in his
answer, his SCA, responses to Interrogatories, his personal subject interview, and credit
reports from August 2019, January 2021, February 2021, and June 2022. (GE 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6)
Character witnesses testified  on  Applicant’s behalf. His father testified  that he  is
aware of Applicant’s financial difficulties due to his wife being out of work. He believes his
son has always made an effort to pay his bills. His son has always acted responsibly and
he is confident he will pay his creditors. The circumstances that created his son’s financial
problems were beyond his control and given enough time he will resolve his debts. (Tr.
58-59)
Applicant’s  father-in-law  testified  on  his  behalf.  He  has  known  Applicant  since
2018. He described Applicant as a supportive husband and father and a stable provider.
He and Applicant coach a youth soccer team together. His daughter has had some health

conditions, and in the whole-person analysis.
challenges. He is not aware of Applicant’s financial issues, but he is a hard-worker and
provides for his family. (Tr. 59-61)
Applicant provided character letters from people he worked with for 6 to 12 months.
He  is  described  as  a  person  with  high  moral  and  ethical  standards.  He  is  considered
exceptional, responsible, loyal, and dependable. He is a family man who provided a new
home for his family and has a good attitude and work ethic. (Tr. 54-55; AE M, N, Q)
Applicant testified that he is not an insider threat. He is a family man who got into
some financial difficulties. Post-hearing, Applicant provided a statement that he realizes
holding a security clearance is a privilege and he takes that responsibility seriously. He
has never done anything that would be perceived as a threat to national security. He is a
patriot and would not do anything to harm the country. He made some financial choices
and has personal debt, but he cannot be blackmailed. He has not received pressure from
his creditors as they have written-off his debt. He reaffirmed his commitment to protect
classified information. (AE S)
