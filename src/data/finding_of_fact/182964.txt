Applicant admitted the SOR allegation in ¶ 1.a and denied the allegations in ¶¶ 1.b
through 1.p. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, admissions, testimony,
and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 44  years old.  He married  in 2000  and  has four children,  ages 15, 13,
11   and   9.  He   earned  a   bachelor’s  degree   in   2000  and   a  master’s  degree   in  2008.  He
served  in the  Army  from  2003  to  2005  and  was honorably  discharged  due  to  noncombat-
related   medical   issues.  Applicant   disclosed   on   his  June   2020   security   clearance
application   (SCA)  that   he   was  employed   by   the   same   federal  contractor  from   2005   to
2019.  He  also  disclosed   he   began   employment  with   a   different  federal  contractor  in
October 2019. At his hearing, he  testified  that in early  2021,  he  began  work for  another
federal   contractor.   He   did   not  disclose   any   periods   of  unemployment   in  his  SCA.  He
testified  that while  employed  the  contracts would change  and  there  were weeks when  he
would not get paid, but  he did  not have  any  extended  periods of  employment since  he  left
the  military. (Tr. 15-19, 82-84; GE 1)
Applicant  testified   that  prior  to   2018,   his   annual  salary   was  about   $45,000.
Beginning   in  2018,  his  pay   increased   to   approximately   $95,000.  In   January   2021,  his
salary  increased  to  $115,000. Applicant attributed  his financial problems to  his wife  losing
her  job   in  2015,   and   they   could  not  keep   up   with   their   expenses.  His  wife   has  some
medical  issues  and   difficulty   working   full   time.  She   resumed   full-time   employment  15-
months ago and  earns  between  $50,000  and $60,000  annually. Applicant stated he  was
living off of credit to  pay for food and clothing  for his family after she  lost her job.  He also
indicated he  mismanaged his money. (Tr. 19-21, 27-28, 81, 87; GE  2)
Applicant disclosed on his 2020 SCA that he had a judgment entered against him
in 2009 and his wages were garnished to pay the debt. He also disclosed that because
his  wife  lost  her  job  in  2015,  they  missed  mortgage  payments  and  foreclosure
proceedings  were  initiated.  He  disclosed  that  he  had  attempted  to  obtain  a  loan
modification, which was denied, and he was looking for another option to resolve the debt.
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in June 2020, shortly after
he completed his SCA. He told the investigator that in 2017 he sought a loan modification
on his mortgage, which was granted. He made some payments, but after a few months,
he began to miss payments again. He told the investigator that he tried to negotiate a
new modification with the mortgage company because his wife was now employed, but it
refused to grant a new modification. He said that his overall finances were now good with
the exception of the mortgage. He and his wife were working and paying all of their bills
on  time.  Because  he  could  not  obtain  a  loan  modification  at  that  time,  he  planned  on
requesting in the next month a short-sale on the property. (GE 2)
Applicant testified that he was making his mortgage payments from 2015 through
2018, but had missed some payments. The company he worked for had lost a contract
and  he  had  to  look  for  an  opening  with  the  next  contractor,  so  he  was  not  receiving
income. He estimated he was unemployed for about a month. He said his wife went back
to work after she lost her job, but lost her job again. He could not recall the specific time
periods. He was granted a loan modification in December 2018, with the first payment
due January 2019. Applicant did not provide specifics regarding how many months he did
not  make  timely  payments.  He  said  the  mortgage  company  would  not  accept  late
payments.  They  remained  living  in  the  house.  He  broke  his  ankle  in  July  2019  and
although he had medical insurance, not all of the expenses were covered. The mortgage
went  into  foreclosure  again.  The  creditor  would  not  accept  late  payments.  He  did  not
make payments from July 2019 until June 2022 when he was granted a new modification
to  his  mortgage.  He  is  current  on  his  mortgage  and  provided  a  document  to  show  he
made his August 2022 payment. (Tr. 37-51; AE B, C)
Other  than  the  two  debts  noted  above,  Applicant  did  not  disclose  any  other
delinquent debts in his SCA. When he was interviewed by the government investigator,
he did not disclose any delinquent debts other than the mortgage. He said his finances
were all good except for the mortgage. He was then confronted with the delinquent debts
and collection accounts alleged in the SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.p. (GE 2, 3)
All  of  the  debts alleged  in the  SOR are  reported  on  his June  2020  credit report and
are  corroborated   by   Applicant’s  testimony   and   statements  made   to   the   government
investigator. (GE 1, 2, 3)
Applicant  acknowledged  to  the  investigator  the  collection  accounts  for  medical
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.j ($526) and 1.l ($203). They were incurred in approximately
July 2019 when he broke his ankle. He said he could not recall they were in collection or
when they were considered delinquent. He told the investigator that he had arranged a
monthly payment plan with the creditor three months ago and it would be paid over the
next  year.  At  his  hearing,  he  testified  that  these  debts  were  “recalled.”  He  could  not
provide an explanation for what that meant. He said he had been making payments, but
provided no proof of the payments. He admitted they were valid debts, but be believes
they were canceled. There is insufficient evidence that Applicant made payments on the
debts or to corroborate they have been resolved. (Tr. 69-74)
When  confronted  by  the  investigator, Applicant admitted  owing  the debt  in SOR ¶
1.f  ($969). The  debt was for an  alarm  system  he  had  installed  in his home  in  2006. He
told the  investigator he  canceled  the  service in 2011  and  was current on  his payments.
He said he  was unaware it was delinquent or that the  account was in collection.  In  his
SOR answer, he stated the amount owed was less than alleged and the account was in
a payment plan. He testified that he believed the debt was paid. He provided documents
to show he made monthly payments of $19.46 from April 2022 to August 2022. This debt
is being resolved. (Tr. 63-64; AE E)
Applicant was confronted  by  the  investigator with  each  collection  account  in SOR
¶¶ 1.b  ($4,528);  1.c ($1,943);  1.d  ($1,549);  1.e  ($1,439);  1.g  ($942);  1.h  ($542); 1.i ($536);
1.k ($465);  1.m  ($135);  1.n  ($81), 1.o  ($80);  and  1.p  ($61). For each  of these  accounts,
Applicant  told   the   investigator  that  he   could   not  recall   any   of   the   specifics   about   the
account,  such  as when  it was opened, when  it went delinquent,  or if  it was only   in his
name. He  said he  had  difficulty  remembering  the  majority  of  his credit cards and  loans.
He did not disclose  them  because  he  was not familiar with  them  and  thought they  were
taken  care of. He  said  he  would begin making  payments when  required. He would  look
into his unpaid  debts  and pay  off the  smaller debts  as  soon  as  possible and  would  make
payment  arrangements for his other debts  He  hoped  to  have  them all  paid within a  year.
(GE 2).
In Applicant’s answer to the  SOR, he stated  the  debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c,  1.d, 1.f,
and  1.g,  were all  in  payment plans.  SOR ¶¶  1.b, 1.c,  1.d  and  1.m  have  the  same  collection
creditor. A  document Applicant provided  shows that in July  and  August 2022   he  made
payments   of $58   on  one  account   and   $45  or another.   He   wrote   in   the  margin  that   the
payments  were  applied   to   SOR  ¶¶   1.b   and   1.c  respectively.  He  did  not  provide
documentary  evidence  that he  has  payment plans  with  the  collection  creditor  or any  other
payment  agreements.  The  accounts  in  SOR  ¶¶ 1.b  and  1.c  are  both  credit  card  accounts
that   went  into   collection   in   approximately   2015.   He   testified   that   he   has   been   making
monthly   payments  on   the   debt  in   SOR  ¶   1.c  since   June   2021.   He  did  not   provide
corroborating   documents  to   show   the   payments.   He  provided   a   document  from   the
collection  creditor for the  debt  in SOR ¶  1.b,  indicating  that a  payment of  $50.38  would
be   electronically   withdrawn   from   his  account   in   January   2021   and   the   balance   was
$4,175.  He  testified  that he  had made  51 payments on  this  debt  and  the  current  balance
was $3,974.  I left  the  record open  to  allow  him  to  document  the  current balance  and  proof
of payments  for the last six months. No corroborating documents were provided.  (Tr. 23-
26, 28-33, 52-56; GE  2, 3; AE C, D, E)
Applicant provided a document that shows $52 monthly payments from February
2022  to  August 2022  were  paid  to a  collection  law firm. He wrote in  the margin  of  the
document that payments are for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d, but no evidence was provided to
corroborate that this payment is for that debt. The document does not identify the debt.
He testified that he has been making monthly payments since June 2021. He provided a
letter from March 2021 from the same collection law firm that shows a payment of $200
was  applied  to  a  different  creditor  account.  I  cannot  corroborate  that  his  $52  monthly
payments were for SOR ¶ 1.d or whether they were for another debt he is paying through
this law firm. He did not provide documentary evidence that he has a payment plan with
the collection law firm for SOR ¶ 1.d. (Tr. 55-58; AE C, D, E)
Applicant provided a document to show payments were made to another law firm
on the collection account in SOR ¶ 1.g. The payments of $64 were paid from February
through May 2022. He provided an undated copy of a settlement offer from the law firm.
The offer was to settle the account at a 70% discount with a one-time lump sum payment
that had to be paid within 30 days. He wrote comments on the letter that are undiscernible,
other than noting it was for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g. The letter notes the balance owed,
which matches the amount in the SOR. I believe this is the same debt. He testified that
the debt is paid, but did not provide documentary evidence to  confirm the resolution of
the debt. He is given credit for making some payments on the debt. (Tr. 64-65; AE C)
Applicant provided evidence that he resolved the debt in SOR ¶ 1.m. It is unknown
when it was paid. He provided evidence that in March 2021 he resolved the debts in SOR
¶¶ 1.n and 1.p. He provided a copy of a medical bill for his wife that showed there was a
balance of $99 due in March 2021. He indicated this bill is for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.o. It is
a different creditor than that alleged in the SOR. It is unresolved. (Tr. 37, 76-80; AE C)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he wrote “account is canceled” for the debts in
¶¶ 1.e, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.k. All of these debts are reported as delinquent and in collection in
Applicant’s June 2020 credit report. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.e had a last activity date in 2013
and was charged off in March 2014; ¶ 1.h was charged off in April 2014; ¶ 1.i was charged
off  in  May 2014;  and ¶  1.k  shows  the  account  is with  a  collection law firm  and  its  last
activity date was June 2017. Due to the age of these debts they have likely fallen off of
Applicant’s more recent credit reports.
Applicant  testified that he  contacted  the  creditor  in SOR  ¶ 1.e and  was  told  the
debt was either canceled or not valid. He admitted that he did not pay the debt. He said
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h is valid and he did not pay it. He believes the account is now closed.
He acknowledged the debt in SOR ¶ 1.i and said he reached out to the creditor. He did
not pay the debt and believes it was canceled due to its age. (Tr. 59-62, 65-68; GE 3)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.k is for a collection account for a communication company
that went into collection in December 2018. He settled the account in  March 2021. (Tr.
71-72; AE F)
Applicant  provided  current  copies  of  credit  reports from each  of  the  three  credit
bureaus. Except for his mortgage and the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k, no other delinquent debts
are reflected. It is noted that Applicant owes more than $75,000 of student loans that have
been deferred under the government’s moratorium due to the pandemic. He stated that
his payments will be approximately $800 a month when the deferment ends. (Tr. 105; AE
F, G, H)
Throughout the hearing, Applicant had difficulty identifying the specific accounts
he was making a payment towards. Some payments could have been for accounts that
were not alleged in the SOR. I have attempted to give him credit for payments made, but
in  some  instances,  without  additional  evidence  it  was  impossible  to  determine  if  an
account was held by a new collection company or an existing creditor and which creditor
Applicant’s  payments  were  going   to.  Applicant  could  not  recall   the   identity   of   certain
accounts or how long he had  them.
Applicant  was  asked during the hearing if  he  paid his  federal  income  taxes.  He
testified that he usually owes federal income taxes and that he currently owes the Internal
Revenue  Service  $9,000 for tax year 2021. He  testified  that  he  now has  an  additional
$600 withheld from his pay to cover future tax liability. He does not have an installment
agreement  with  the  IRS  for  his 2021  tax  debt.  He  explained  he  sends  the  IRS  money
when he can to apply to his 2021 taxes. He estimated that when he sends money to the
IRS, it is about $250. He has not contacted the IRS, but he did receive a letter from them
about his tax liability. He testified that he did not owe federal income taxes for 2020. (Tr.
87-93)
Applicant testified that he withdrew money from his 401(k) for living expenses. He
paid the tax penalty when he withdrew the funds. He estimated the amount he withdrew
to be around $2,000. He and his wife have two joint bank accounts. He estimated he has
about $250 in one and $500 in the other. He does not have a budget, but tries to put his
expenses  on  a  worksheet  and  keep  track  of  his  weekly  bills.  He  has  had  no  financial
counseling. He worries about his bills and what to pay and when. He believes he has a
better grasp on his finances. He said he now checks his credit and is more enlightened.
He did not begin to address his delinquent debts until 2021. He admitted he and his wife
did not pay attention to their bills. He was receiving letters from collectors. He said he
tried a money management program. He did not elaborate on the program and could not
recall the name of the program. He said the period of time he participated in it was maybe
2007,  2012  or  2013.  He  believes  he  has  made  improvements  regarding  his  financial
situation. He testified he is a responsible father and has provided his family a stable home.
He now has a record system to keep track of his finances. He said he is making progress
and handling his bills. (Tr. 22, 33, 84-87, 93-102)
