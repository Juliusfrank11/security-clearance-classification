The  SOR alleges that,  as of  November 15, 2021, Applicant owed  $19,045  (SOR ¶
1.a) and  $2,105  (SOR ¶  1.g) on  loans for repossessed  vehicles;  $614  (SOR ¶  1.b), $300
(SOR ¶  1.c), and  $437  (SOR ¶  1.d) in credit-card balances in collections; $25  (SOR ¶  1.e)
in medical collection  debt;  $55  (SOR ¶  1.f) on  a  charged-off  utility  account;  and  $3,956
(SOR ¶  1.h) in collection  debt placed  by  a  former landlord. When  Applicant responded  to
the   SOR,  he   admitted   that  he   incurred   the   debts  but   stated   that  he   had   repayment
arrangements for the  debts in SOR ¶¶  1.a, 1.g, and  1.h; had  settled  the  debts in SOR ¶¶
1.b-1.d  for less than  their  full  balances; and  had  satisfied  in full  the  debts in SOR ¶¶  1.e
and  1.f. He provided  documents confirming  payments,  which  were  accepted  into  the  record
as exhibits at his hearing.
I  accept  Applicant’s  admissions  to  having  owed  the  delinquent  balances  and
incorporate  them  as  factual  findings.  After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and
transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  32-year-old  high  school  graduate.  He  and  his  spouse  married  in
February 2014. (GE 1.) They have an infant daughter, who was born in February 2022. (Tr.
20.) Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor as a Class A machinist since
March 2020. (Tr. 24.)
Applicant worked  as a  setup  operator for a  company  in his home  state  after high
school. After some  five  years there, he  was making  only  $15  an  hour, so  in April 2013, he
and  his future spouse  relocated  for a  new  job  paying  him  $22  an  hour in a  state  with  a
lower cost of  living. (GE 1; Tr. 37-38.) The  job  was in a  rural area  with  limited  job  prospects
in the  manufacturing  sector. (Tr. 37.) A  year into  his new  job, it became  apparent that the
business was failing  and  layoffs were expected. Applicant indicated  on  a  January  7, 2020
Questionnaire  for National Security  Positions (SF 86) that  he  left  the  job  before  he  could  be
laid  off  “like many  of  [his] coworkers were.” (GE 1.) At his hearing, he  testified  that he  was
laid   off   in  “a  very   big   downsizing.”  (Tr.  36.)  Whether  he   was  formally   laid   off   or  left
voluntarily  in September 2014  in anticipation  of  being  laid  off, he  and  his spouse  returned
to  their  home  state. (Tr. 37-38.)  Before they  left,  Applicant informed  his landlord  (SOR ¶
1.h) to  see  if  he  could be  released  from  the  remaining  term  on  his  apartment  lease.  He  was
informed  that he  would not have  to  pay  for the  months left on  his lease  provided  someone
moved  into  the  apartment after they  vacated.  He did not receive  any  correspondence  from
the   landlord   after  he   moved.  Given   the   full   remaining   rent  balance   was  reported   on
Applicant’s credit report, he assumes the landlord did not rent out the vacant apartment.
(Tr. 51.)
From October 2014 until January 2020, Applicant worked as a Class A machinist for
a manufacturing company. (GE 1.) His spouse was a daycare worker for almost the entire
time, earning approximately $11 an hour. Most of her income went toward her student
loans. (Tr. 32-33.) During that time, Applicant opened credit-card accounts that he did not
handle responsibly. (Tr. 45.) Applicant was terminated from his job, which paid him an
hourly wage of $26 by the end of his employment, for absentee issues. He appealed and
was awarded unemployment compensation at 60% of his income for about two months.
(Tr. 26-29.)
The  cost  of  living  was  substantially  higher  in  Applicant’s  home  state,  and  he
struggled to maintain his payments on some of his financial obligations. (Tr. 36-39.) As of
March 19, 2020, his credit report showed that he had defaulted on the SOR accounts (GE
3), as set forth in the following table.

$177.71  monthly
through June 2022 to reduce
balance to $3,127. (AE K.)
Applicant started working for his current employer in March 2020 at $38 an hour.
(Tr. 24.) His income was significantly higher than in his previous job, but so too was his and
his spouse’s housing expense. Their monthly rent went from $785 in their previous locale
to  $2,057  (heating and  water included) on  their relocation.  (Tr. 54,  66-67.) Applicant’s
spouse worked in child daycare for three months at $14 an hour and then at a “doggie
daycare” at about $12.50 per hour for about six months until August 2021, when she quit
working due to her pregnancy. (Tr. 30-32.)
Applicant did not list any financial delinquencies on his January 2020 SF 86. (GE 1.)
On April 6, 2020, he had a personal subject interview (PSI) with an authorized investigator
for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). While reviewing the financial section on
his SF 86, Applicant volunteered that he was delinquent on four accounts: two vehicle
loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.g)  and  two  credit-card  accounts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.d).  He
explained that someone in his security office had told him to “leave it blank” if he did not
have the information for the accounts. When asked about the debts, he explained that he
became delinquent on the vehicle loan in SOR ¶ 1.a because of a reduction in income
when he moved back to his home state, and the vehicle was repossessed in mid-2015. He
admitted that he had made no attempts to resolve the deficiency balance of about $12,000
on his loan as he did not have the funds to put toward the debt. As for the auto loan in
SOR ¶ 1.g, which Applicant asserted was a joint loan with his spouse but which is reported
as his loan on his credit report (GE 3), he was $700 behind in his payments for a vehicle
that  was  “a  lemon.”  He  further  explained  that  he  tried  to  resolve  the  issue  before  the
vehicle was repossessed sometime in the summer of 2017. He indicated that he would
contact  the  creditor within  the  next  two  months  to  make  repayment arrangements.  He
estimated that he owed respective balances of $300 and $550 on the credit-card accounts
in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d, which became delinquent because of a loss of overtime availability.
He admitted he had no plans established to address the debts, but he intended to contact
a debt consolidation agency within the next two months.  (GE 2.)
Applicant was then confronted about the delinquent balances on his March 2020
credit report. He stated that he did not realize that the balance of the automobile loan was
as  high  as  the  reported  $19,045,  and  that  he  plans  on  including  the  debt  in  a  debt
consolidation  plan.  Similarly,  he  did  not  realize  that  he  owed  $608  on  the  credit-card
account opened with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.c. He did not recognize the medical debt in
SOR ¶ 1.e, or the collection entities identified in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d (same company) and
SOR ¶ 1.h, but indicated he would research the accounts and pay the medical debt within
the day if it was valid. He recognized the utility provider in SOR ¶ 1.f but explained that he
did not know he owed a balance. He stated that he would research the debt and pay it
within five days if it is valid. He explained that he had been depending on overtime to pay
his bills and overtime became unavailable. He denied any chance of recurrence of him
becoming delinquent on financial accounts because he was living within his means, making
more responsible financial decisions, and not opening any new credit-card accounts. He
had not received any financial counseling as of his PSI. (GE 2.)
As  of  July  19, 2021, the  debt in SOR ¶  1.h  was no  longer on  Applicant’s credit
report. The other SOR debts were still listed on his credit report. Applicant had a record of
timely $420 monthly payments on a joint vehicle loan obtained for $19,794 in July 2018.
The  balance  of  the loan was $12,887 as of  July 2021.  (GE 4.) The loan is for a 2015
model-year vehicle. It is their only car. (Tr. 53-56.) He had opened a credit-card account in
May 2021 with a $1,000 credit limit. As of July 2021, the account had a $1,087 balance.
(GE 4.)
After his PSI, Applicant checked his credit report periodically for his credit score. (Tr.
48.) Apart from paying the medical debt in collection (SOR ¶ 1.e), he made no effort to
address the past-due debts on his credit report before he received the SOR on November
17,  2021.  (Tr.  42,  44,  62.)  On  receipt  of  the  SOR,  he  contacted  his  creditors  about
repayment arrangements for the car loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.g) and the apartment debt
(SOR ¶ 1.h), and for lump-sum settlements on the other delinquencies, as he realized that
he had to address them for his clearance eligibility. (Tr. 43-45.) The creditor for the car-loan
deficiency in SOR ¶ 1.a wanted $606 per month, which he indicated he could not afford.
He was then given the option of paying what he could each month. (Tr. 68.) He arranged to
make monthly payments of $50 on the car debt in SOR ¶ 1.g and $177 on the apartment
debt in SOR ¶ 1.h. He did some house and yard work for his parents to pay off a loan for
$300, sold some of his possessions, and “scraped together” what he could from his income
to make payments on his debts. (Tr. 46-47.)
Applicant stopped paying on the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.g after three months.
(Tr. 20, 42, 50.) He could no longer afford the payments because he and his spouse have
incurred about $200 in monthly expenses for their daughter’s diapers and formula since
her birth in February 2022. (Tr. 66.) He continued to make his monthly payments toward
the apartment debt. (AE K.)
Applicant  and  her  spouse  combined  their  incomes  when  she  was  working.  He
handled the monthly household bills, including paying their rent. His spouse paid for the
groceries and yearly vehicle taxes. They made an effort to keep each other informed about
their expenses. (Tr. 34-35.) Applicant’s hourly wage increased to $41 in 2022. (Tr. 25.) He
had $1,600 in a checking account in June 2022, most of which was earmarked for his and
his spouse’s July 2022 rent. He had only $20 in his savings account. (Tr. 57.) His and his
spouse’s financial situation is “more stable than it’s ever been,” but they continue to live
from paycheck to paycheck. (Tr. 60-61.)
Applicant’s  spouse  obtained  a  part-time  job,  20  to  30  hours  per  week  in  the
evenings, as a store clerk at $14.25 per hour starting in July 2022. (Tr. 30, 63.) Since they
cannot afford daycare, Applicant plans to watch his daughter in the evenings when his
spouse is working. (Tr. 63.) Applicant understands that he did not always exercise sound
financial judgment in the past in that he lived beyond his limited means. (Tr. 19.)  He is
committed to seeing through his repayment agreement with his former landlord (SOR ¶
1.h), and with the expected income from his spouse’s employment, getting back on track
with the arrangements for the two defaulted car loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.g). (Tr. 22.)
Applicant has been timely with his income-tax filings. He currently owes less than
$1,000 in federal income taxes for a tax year(s) prior to 2020, and tax refunds have been
taken and applied to the tax liability. (Tr. 59-60.) Information about the extent of the tax
debt  and  the  tax year(s) involved  was  not  presented  in  evidence.  When  he began his
current job, he arranged for additional tax withholdings from his income to help pay down
his federal tax debt. (Tr. 60.)
Character Reference
Applicant’s current supervisor has worked for their employer for 39 years. He attests
that Applicant can be counted on to fulfill his work duties with little disruption and to inform
him of any work or personal issues that need to be addressed. He described Applicant as
“a quiet presence in a large group of men that are a generation older than him.” Applicant
has been willing to learn and asks relevant questions. The supervisor believes Applicant
“has a trustworthy and dependable character.”  (AE I.)
