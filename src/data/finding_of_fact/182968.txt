Applicant is 50  years old, has never married,  and has no children. He cohabitated
with  a  woman  (the  Cohabitant) from  2004  until September 2020. He  currently  lives with  a
new  girlfriend.  He has a  high  school diploma  and  has taken  college  courses over  several
years, but has not yet earned a  degree. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1994 and served
until 2002  when  he  was honorably  discharged. He then  entered  the  Navy  Reserve  for two
years. He was honorably  discharged  from  the  Reserve  in 2004. When  he  served  in the
Navy  he  held  a  Top  Secret  security  clearance  for a  period  and  then  a  Secret  clearance.
He  has   also   held  a   Secret   clearance   while   working   as  a   defense   contractor.   He  has
worked  as an  analyst  for his current employer since  2007.  He seeks to  retain national
security  eligibility  and  a  security  clearance  in connection  with  his employment.  (Tr. at 20-
28; GE 1 at 7-12, 18-19, 29-31.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he is financially overextended and  has failed to pay his Federal taxes  and to
timely file his Federal and state income tax returns. The Government alleged that these
facts render Applicant potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage
in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR lists five allegedly past-due consumer debts
that have been referred to collection or charged off. The total amount of these debts is
$32,755. The SOR also alleged three years of delinquent Federal tax debts in the total
amount  of  about  $5,500  for  tax  years  (TYs)  2018,  2019,  and  2020.  Lastly,  the  SOR
alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal and state income tax returns for 2019
and  2020.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  under  this  guideline
except one (SOR 1.e), which is a debt he asserted he had paid. He also wrote that he
paid SOR debt 1.d and his delinquent Federal taxes and that he has filed his Federal and
state tax returns for TYs 2019 and 2020. (Answer at 1-2.)
The current status of the matters alleged in paragraph 1 of the SOR is as follows:
1.a.  Credit  union   credit-card  account   charged   off   in  the   amount  of   $15,244.
Applicant defaulted  on  paying  the  monthly  payments in 2018  during  a  period  of financial
distress. He  has made  calls to the credit union about this debt and the debts  owed to the
same  credit union  listed  in  subparagraphs 1.b  and  1.c,  but  he  has  not  taken  any  significant
steps to  repay  this debt.  He intends to  do  what is necessary  to  take  care of  these  three
debts. The  debt alleged  in subparagraph  1.a  is not  resolved. (Tr. at 28-31, 68; GE  2  at 4;
GE  3 at 2; GE  4 at 5.)
1.b.  Credit  union   credit-card  account  charged   off   in  the   approximate   amount  of
$9,356. Applicant defaulted on paying the monthly payments in 2018 during a period of
financial distress. He has not taken any significant steps to repay this debt. This debt is
not resolved. (Tr. at 28-31; GE 2 at 3; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 5.)
1.c.  Credit  union  debt-consolidation  loan  account  charged  off  in the  approximate
amount   of  $7,961.
Applicant   defaulted   on   paying   the   monthly   loan   payments   in   2019
during  a  period  of financial distress.  He has not taken  any  significant steps to  repay  this
debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 28-33; GE 2  at 2; GE 3  at 2; GE 4  at 5.)
1.d. Medical collection  account in  the  approximate  amount of  $150.  Applicant paid
this debt over the  phone  in May  2022. This debt has  been  resolved. (Tr.  at  34-35; GE  3
at 3; GE  4 at 6.)
1.e.  Communication   service  provider   account  in  collection   in   the   approximate

amount   of   $44.
Applicant paid  this  debt in  January  2021.  This  debt  has  been  resolved. (Tr. at  35-36;  GE
3 at 3.)
1.f.  Delinquent  Federal  tax  debt  for TY  2018  in  the  approximate  amount of $2,475.
This tax  debt and  the  debts alleged  in SOR 1.g  and  1.h  were the  result of  Applicant under-
withholding  taxes on  his income  and  changes in the  tax  law. Applicant resolved  this tax
debt with  a  credit from  a  prior tax  year  and  a  payment in March 2022  of  $572. This debt
has been resolved. (Tr. at  37-44; AE G at 1-2.)
1.g. Delinquent Federal tax  debt  for  TY  2019  in  the  approximate  amount  of $2,313.
Applicant resolved  this  tax  debt  with  payments in April and  September 2022.  This debt
has been resolved. (Tr. at 37-44; AE B; AE  H at 1-2.)
1.h. Delinquent  Federal tax  debt for TY  2020  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $728.
Applicant resolved  this  tax  debt  with  payments in March  and  September  2022.  This  debt
has been resolved. (Tr. at 37-44; AE  B; AE F at 1-2.)
1.i  Failure  to   timely   file   Federal  and   state   tax   returns  in  TYs  2019   and   2020.
Applicant  blamed   his  failure   to   file   his  tax   returns  on   time   for  these   two   years  on   his
financial problems at that time. The Cohabitant  was not able to contribute any significant
funds   to   the   couple’s  expenses   and   those   expenses   fell   mostly   on   Applicant.   He   was
overwhelmed.   He   filed   his  TY   2019   returns   on   September  12,  2022   and   his  TY   2020
returns  on August 29, 2022. (Tr. at 46-48; AE F; AE  H.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  experienced  financial  problems  due  to  poor  money
management and to the financial demands made by the Cohabitant. He bought a house
and was having difficulties paying his bills because he was living beyond his means. The
Cohabitant lost her job and had to take a lower paying job. She was also on disability for
one  year  after  being  diagnosed  as  bipolar.  He  had  tax  problems  due  to  an  early
withdrawal  from  his  retirement  account  in  2017.  In  2020  he  borrowed  money  from  his
401k  to  pay  his  2017  tax  debt  that  resulted  from  the  early  withdrawal  from  his  401k
account. The  IRS was  threatening to  impose a  lien on his house  at  that  time. Later in
2020 he sold the house and received about $100,000 of net proceeds from the sale. He
gave the Cohabitant $40,000, even though the house was in his name. He was unable to
provide an explanation as to why he did not resolve  his other debts with the remaining
sales  proceeds.  He  said  that  with  the  sale  of  the  house  in  which  he  lived  with  the
Cohabitant and the end of that relationship, he just “took a break.” He is trying to get his
life back together following the end of that long-term relationship in 2019 and 2020. His
life has improved since he separated from the Cohabitant. (Tr. at 21-30, 33, 36-41.)
Applicant filed  his TY  2021  tax  returns about a  week before the  hearing. He did not
file  for extensions   so   the   returns  were  untimely.  That fact  was  not   alleged   in  the   SOR
because  the  delinquencies  post-date  the  SOR. He owed  the  Federal Government  about
$4,500  for TY  2021.  He  recently  mailed  a  check to  the  IRS  to  pay  that tax  debt.  (Tr. at  45-
48.)
Applicant presently has about $22,000 in savings. His monthly take home pay is
about $4,000. He recently moved in with a new girlfriend, who has a significant salary. He
contributes $700 to their living expenses and she pays the rest. He owns his car. He has
about  $3,000 of  net  disposable  income after expenses.  He  can afford  a payment  plan
with the credit union if it was willing to accept one. He has not explored that possibility
yet. He recognizes that he has to change his tax withholding to make sure he covers his
yearly  tax  obligations.  He  has  not  done  so  or  taken  other  necessary  actions  on  his
finances because he “hit a  wall” in the 2017-2019 period and is just starting to recover
with the help and support of his new girlfriend. He said, “I just had some really bad years.”
He claims that he used to be financially responsible. At one point since 2018, he sought
the help of a debt relief company to assist him to pay and resolve his debts, but he rejected
their proposal. He has not received any financial counseling. (Tr. at 51-53, 69.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct)
The  details  regarding the  single  SOR  allegation  set forth  in paragraph  2  are  as
follows:
2.a  September 2020  arrest and  charge  of  Driving  Under the  Influence  of  alcohol
(DUI). Applicant had  a  minor accident when  he  failed  to  navigate  a  turn properly  near his
home  after staying  up  all  night. Earlier in  the  evening, he  had  been  drinking  alcohol. When
he   was  driving   home,  he   felt  that  he   was  more  tired   than   intoxicated.   The   sheriff   was
called. Applicant registered  a  0.10% blood  alcohol content even  though  he  had  not had  a
drink in several hours. He was arrested  and  charged  with  DUI.  He was convicted  of  the
offense  of Wet and  Reckless. The  court sentenced  Applicant  to  one  year of  probation.  He
successfully  completed  all  of  the  terms of  his probation, and  it expired  in May  2022. He
also  completed   all   of  the   state   DMV   requirements  to   maintain  his  driver’s  license.
Applicant is  very  aware  that  the  consequences of a  second  similar offense  in  his  state  will
be  much  more severe. This was his first DUI arrest,  and  he  has not had  any  similar arrests
since  September 2020.  At this point he  rarely  drinks to  excess. He  has  a  couple of  glasses
of   wine   two   nights   a   week  with   his  new   girlfriend.  He   does  not   drink  and   drive.  He
describes  his  2020  accident  and  arrest  as  “isolated.”  He  has  never been  diagnosed  with
alcohol use  disorder. (Tr. at 54-61; GE  5.)
Paragraph 3  (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption)
The  Government  cross  alleged  its  Guideline  J  allegation  in  a  single  allegation
under  the  guideline  regarding  Alcohol  Consumption.  See  the  discussion  under  that
guideline, above.
