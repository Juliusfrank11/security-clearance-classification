Applicant  is  a  58-year-old  engineer  working  for  a  defense  contractor.  He  has
worked for his current employer since 1998. He served in the U.S. military or the military
reserve from 1984 to 1997.  He served about eight years on active  duty.  All periods of
service  ended  with  an  honorable  discharge.  He  seeks  to  retain  a  security  clearance,
which  he  has  held  since  his  time  in  the  military.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree  that  he
earned  in  1993.  He  has  never  married,  and  he  has  no  children.  (Tr.  at  9-11,  30;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 3; AE F, K)
Applicant did not file his federal and state income tax returns when they were due
for tax years 1996 through 2006 and 2009 through 2018. He filed his federal and state
income tax returns for 2007 and 2008 on time. He received federal refunds of $2,724 for
2007,  which  included a  $600 stimulus payment,  and $2,573  for 2008. He  testified  that
he  filed  the  2007  returns  on  time  to  qualify  for  a  federal  program  in  which  stimulus
payments were issued in 2008. He felt the stimulus payments were issued for a political
motive.  He  filed  to  receive  the  stimulus  payment,  and  he  then  did  not  vote  for  the
candidates  or  party  that  supported  the  stimulus  program.  (Tr.  at  12,  20-21,  24-27;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3)
Applicant  never  went  into  a  tax  year  thinking  that  he  would  not  file  tax  returns.
Tax season up through April 15th  does not have any holidays, and Applicant would use
that time to concentrate on work. The filing date then slipped by. (Tr. at 26) He testified:
When  I failed  to  file  I didn’t  intend  not to  file, I  just  missed  the  day, and  the
IRS   didn’t  follow-up   with   me   and   I  knew   they   owed   me   money.   And   it
wasn’t until they  thought that I  didn’t owe  them  money  that they  contacted
me   to   tell   me   to   file,   at  which   point   I   did   and   they   sent   me   a   return,   a
refund.   So   that  was  the   nature   of  that  relationship  with   the   IRS   as   I
perceived it.  (Tr. at 22-23)
Applicant credibly  testified  that  he  did  not realize  that he  had  to  file  tax  returns if
he   was  due   refunds.  Since   he   had   more  than   enough   withheld  from   his  paychecks  to
pay  his taxes, he  incorrectly  believed  he  was not required  to file the returns.  He planned
to  file  the  returns and  receive  the  refunds, but he  just  never got around  to  it. (Tr. at 12-
13, 22-26, 36; Applicant’s response  to SOR; GE 2, 3)
Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the  military  in  a  combat  regiment  as  a  first
lieutenant  from  1994  to  1997.  During  that  period,  he  served  in  Operation  Uphold
Democracy  in  Haiti  in  about  1994  to  1995.  He  was  also  involved  in  counter-drug
operations.  He  was  involved  in  training  exercises  and  a  conference.  As  some  point,
likely in about 1996, his regiment asked him to assist other service members to file their
tax  returns,  which  Applicant  stated  took  away  from  his  ability  to  file  his  own  returns.
There is no evidence as to what, if any, training Applicant received in order to help his
troops. He apparently did not learn too much from the experience because he stated he
never used any tax-filing software  and  did  his  own  returns  with  pen  and paper.  (Tr. at
21; GE 1)
IRS tax transcripts indicate that in some years the IRS filed returns for Applicant,
and in at least one year actually issued a refund based on the IRS-prepared returns. For
tax  year  2002,  the  IRS  showed  an  inquiry  for  non-filing  of  tax  return  on  February  23,
2004. The IRS prepared a substitute tax return on July 12, 2004, and refunded $600 to
Applicant on September 3, 2004. (GE 2)
For tax year 2003, the IRS showed an inquiry for non-filing of tax return on April
18, 2004. The IRS prepared a substitute tax return on September 29, 2008. Based on
the IRS-prepared return, Applicant would have been due a refund of $1,742. I note that
it appears that at least one page is missing from the transcript (transcripts typically have
“This Product Contains Sensitive Taxpayer Data” at the bottom (e.g. see transcripts for
2002, 2004, 2005)). However, it was already beyond the three-year window to receive a
refund. (GE 2)
The IRS established that no tax returns was filed for tax years 2004, 2005, and
2006 and issued notices for all three years on June 2, 2008. (GE 2)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
January 2018. He did not report his failure to file federal and state tax returns under the
question that asked: “In the last seven (7) years have you failed to file or pay Federal,
state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance?” (GE 1)
For  tax  year  2017,  the  IRS  issued  an  inquiry  for  non-filing  of  tax  return  on
November 26, 2018, and a notice was issued on December 17, 2018. Applicant filed his
federal and state income tax returns for 2017 in January 2019. The federal return was
received by the IRS in January 15, 2019. The IRS issued a refund of $3,024 on March
1, 2019. (GE 2)
Applicant was interviewed for his background investigation on January 31, 2019,
after  the  2017  return  had  been  filed.  A  signed  statement  was  not  taken,  but  the
interview  was  summarized  in  a  report  of  investigation.  He  initially  answered  that  he
satisfies all legal requirements. He  was asked if he had any questions or concerns, at
which  time,  he  volunteered  that  he  had  not  filed  federal  and  state  tax  returns  since
1997, and he was not sure if he was legally required to do so if he did not owe money.
He filed the returns for 2005 and 2006 (exact year unknown (actually 2007 and 2008)).
GE 3)
Applicant told the investigator that he missed the April 15th deadline each year,
and he believed the IRS and his state were happy since he always had the maximum
amount deducted from his paycheck; he owned a home; and he would be due a refund
of at least $3,000 from the IRS and an unsure amount from his state. He stated that he
received a letter from the IRS in 2018 (presumably the notice for tax year 2017) telling
him to file his 2017 returns. He stated that he was not aware he was legally obligated to
file  tax  returns  if  money  was  due  to  him.  He  indicated  that  he  would  go  through  his
documents to file all the returns from 1997. (GE 3)
When asked at his hearing about his 2018 tax returns following his January 2019
clearance  interview,  Applicant  replied,  “I,  once  again,  was  intending  to  get  the  pencil
and the forms out and do it by hand and the due date slipped because I wasn’t using a
tax service. So yeah, for that year I once again slipped” (Tr. at 32)
The  DOD  sent  Applicant  interrogatories.  The  dates  they  were  sent  to  Applicant
and  when  he  received  them  are  not  in  the  record,  but  it  was  apparently  no  later  than
January  2020,  because  that  period  is  mentioned  in  Applicant’s  response  to  the
interrogatories. (GE 2)
Applicant used to file his own returns by hand. He finally realized it was easier to
use  a  professional,  and  he  retained  the  services  of  a  tax  professional  to  prepare  the
returns. As indicated above, he filed his federal and state income tax returns for 2017 in
January 2019. He requested IRS wage and income transcripts (W-2 information) for the
years that he did not have W-2 forms. He filed the 2009 through 2018 returns in January
and February 2020. The IRS received his 2006 return in September 2020. He was due
federal refunds each year, in amounts ranging from $1,242 to $3,673. Because the IRS
does  not  pay  refunds  from  returns  more  three  years  old,  Applicant  forfeited  almost
$18,000 in federal refunds for tax years 2006 and 2009 through 2015. He stated that he
forfeited  at  least  $10,000  in  refunds  from  his  state  during  the  same  period.  The  IRS
would  not  provide  wage  and  income  transcripts  from  before  2010,  and  Applicant  no
longer  had  information  for  tax  years  before  2006.  (Tr.  at  15-19,  32-34;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2; AE C, D, J)
With  the assistance  of the tax professional,  Applicant filed his federal and  state
income tax returns for 2019, 2020, and 2021 on time.  He received refunds each year.
His state certified that he is in good standing. (Tr. at 33-34; GE 2; AE C, D, H-J)
Applicant accepted responsibility for his tax failures and poor judgment. He has a
good  job  with  a  stable  income.  He  completed  a  financial  counseling  course.  His
finances are currently in good shape, and he is aware that neglecting his tax obligations
in the future could jeopardize his security clearance and his job.  He found the process
of  using a  tax professional easy,  and  he  is no  longer forfeiting thousands  of  dollars in
refunds.  He  credibly  stated  that  he  has  learned  a  valuable  and  costly  lesson,  and  all
future  tax  returns  will  be  filed  on  time.  (Tr.  at  17-19,  32-35;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 3, 4; AE G)
Applicant credibly denied intentionally providing false information about his taxes
on his 2018 SF 86. As addressed above, he did not realize that he was required to file
tax returns if he was due refunds, and he did not owe any taxes. Therefore, he thought
he  provided  the  correct  answer.  He  discussed  his  tax  situation  during  his  background
interview  in  January  2019.  (Tr.  at  17-18,  28,  31-32,  36;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR;
GE  1,  3)  After  considering  all  of  the  evidence,  including  Applicant’s  age,  education,
experience,  character  evidence,  and  credible  testimony,  I  find  he  did  not  intentionally
falsify the SF 86. Additional comments with be provided in the Analysis section.
Applicant called a witness, and he  submitted documents and letters attesting to
his  moral  character  and  excellent  job  performance.  He  is  praised  for  his  honesty,
trustworthiness,  judgment,  dedication,  work  ethic,  and  diligent  handling  of  classified
information. His supervisor who has known Applicant since 2012 testified that Applicant
“is very honest. He will tell you like it is and tell you the truth, whether it’s good truth or
bad truth.” (Tr. at 36-43; GE 2; AE A, E, L)
