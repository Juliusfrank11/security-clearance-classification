Applicant is 53 years old. He is married for the second time. He has one adult child
from his first marriage and two adult stepchildren.  He earned a high school diploma in
1987. He began his current employment with a major aerospace company in June 2009,
having previously worked there from 1996 to 2002. He is applying for his first national
security  eligibility  so  he  can  support  his  employer’s  ongoing  and  prospective  DoD
contracts. He never served in the military or held a Federal civil service position. (GE 1;
GE 2; Tr. 8-9, 34-35, 46-47.)
As alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b, Applicant and his first wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy
relief  during  October  1997.  The  bankruptcy  court  discharged  their  eligible  debts  in
February 1998. Applicant testified that their marriage was contentious and  he  “was not
responsible with [his] money at all back then.” (GE 3; Tr. 36.)
Applicant’s divorce from  his first wife  was finalized  in May  2004  and  he  married  his
current wife in July 2005. They encountered  no  financial difficulties during their  first eight
years of marriage, and  purchased  their  first home  in  February  2012.  In  2013  Applicant
suffered  some  significant  medical issues,  causing  him  to  miss  several months of  work.
He also  incurred  increasing  expenses of  three  teenage  sons’  involvement  in sports, and
had  reduced  overtime  availability  at work  when  he  returned. He and  his wife  borrowed
funds to  try  to  remain solvent,  but eventually  fell  behind  on  some  debts including  a  four-
or-five-month  delinquency  on  their  home  mortgage. Their  lender filed  a  foreclosure  action
at  that  point.   They   wanted   to   protect  their   home,  in   which  they   had   already   accrued
substantial equity, and  sought legal advice.  Their  attorney  advised  and  assisted  them  to
file for  Chapter 13 bankruptcy  protection, which they  did in April 2014  as alleged  in SOR
¶ 1.b. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 28-30, 37-40, 52-53.)
Applicant’s medical troubles continued and he suffered a six-month period in which
he could not work, causing problems with fully making the initial court-ordered monthly
bankruptcy payments, of  which he kept his attorney apprised. The attorney apparently
filed a request to lower those payments to an affordable level. During the same period,
his father-in-law suffered a debilitating disease. The family decided  that Applicant’s in-
laws would sell their home in another state and move in with Applicant and his wife so
that  her  father  could  continue  to  be  cared  for  at  home.  This  arrangement  generated
significant funds that were contributed to Applicant and his wife to repay or bring current
all of the debts involved in their bankruptcy. They then petitioned to have the bankruptcy
dismissed by the court in January 2017, and began resolving each underlying debt with
the respective creditor in a methodical and reasonable manner. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 28-30,
37-40, 52-53.)
The  SOR also alleged  five  specific delinquent consumer debts, totaling  $4,152.00,
that remained  on  Applicant’s credit reports in  early  2020. These  accounts  were opened
between  2010  and  2014  and  were among  the  last  of  the  bankruptcy  debts resolved  by
Applicant and  his wife,  who  is the  primary  manager of  their  finances.  The  largest of these
debts   (SOR  ¶   1.c)   was  a   secured   $3,183.00   loan   for  a   vacuum   cleaner  that  she
purchased. This debt was fully  repaid in August 2019. The  other four debts  (SOR ¶¶  1.d-
1.g), totaling  $969.00,  were  also repaid  in  full  between  mid-2017  and  early-2020.  (GE  2,
GEs  4-7; AE  A; Tr. 40-42.)
During  2012  and  2013,  while  Applicant was struggling  financially, he  had  too  little
Federal  income   tax   withheld  from   his  paychecks  and   bonuses,   and   incurred   some
additional  tax   liability  for  IRA   withdrawals.  As  a   result,  he   incurred   $14,584.00   in
delinquent  tax  debt,  as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.h. He filed  proper  returns  documenting  these
shortfalls  and   made   contemporaneous  arrangements  with   the   IRS  to   increase   his
withholdings, pay  $300  per month, and  forfeit subsequent refunds  to  repay  this debt.  After
three  or four years of  compliance  with  this agreement, he  completed  full  repayment of  this
debt. He  has  not experienced  any  other income  tax  issues.  (GE 1; GE  2; AE  B; Tr. 22,
27, 34, 44-46.)
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges a former $3,156.00 child support arrearage owed to Applicant’s
state’s Department  of Social  and   Health   Services.   After the   separation  preceding   their
2004   divorce,   Applicant’s  then-four-year-old  son   lived   with   him   but   his  former  wife
provided  no  child  support. During  his senior year of high  school, that  son  declared  that  he
would no  longer follow  Applicant’s rules and  was going  to  go  live  with  his mother so  he
could   just  party   and   play   video   games.   The   arrangement   among   them   provided   that
Applicant  would  pay   no   child   support  to   his  former  wife,  but  she   was  on   welfare  and
claimed  their  son  as a  dependent  to  increase  her  monthly  payments. The  state  paid her
the  equivalent of child  support payments and  charged  Applicant  for  them  because  he  was
a  solvent parent.  This continued  until the  son  graduated  from  high  school at age  19, but
Applicant was not notified  of  the  debt until he  had  accumulated  the  alleged  arrearage. He
made  regular payments to  the  state  for a  couple of  years until he  had  paid  all  support
claimed  by  the  state. Due  to  a  clerical error, the  state  failed  to  report this fact to  the  credit
bureaus so  the  debt remained  on  the  credit report. Applicant provided  a  letter from  the
state  agency  documenting  his completion  of payments  in July  2014  as an  attachment to
his Answer. (Tr. 15-17, 25, 46-48.)
Applicant’s current financial situation is good. His wife works almost full time as a
substitute secretary for two local school districts, his father-in-law passed away, and his
mother-in-law  is  living  in  a  nursing  home  that  is  fully  paid  for  by  her  ex-husband’s
insurance   as  a   retired   postal  employee.  They   sold  their   former  home   and   put  about
$80,000.00  of  equity  into  a  down  payment for the  home  they  currently  own  and  live   in.
They  have  a  stable  budget and  sufficient income  that has allowed  them  to  remain current
on  all  financial obligations while  making  regular contributions  to  retirement savings. (GE
6; GE 7; Tr. 30-34, 39-40, 43-44, 53-54.)
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified material facts in his March 2018 e-QIP
response to the Section 26 bankruptcy question by disclosing his Chapter 13 filing but
saying that it was dismissed at his request because he “had the money to catch up the
house up to current and payoff [sic] the cars involved.” This was generally consistent with
what  Applicant  told  the  investigator  during  his  April  2019  OPM  enhanced  subject
interview.  The  SOR  alleges  that  the  statement  was  false  because  it  differed  from  his
“representation to the Bankruptcy Court on December 2014, 2016, when [he] moved to
dismiss  the  case  because  he  could  ‘no  longer  afford  to  make  [his]  Chapter  13  Plan
Payments.” On that date, Applicant’s attorney filed a motion seeking voluntary dismissal
of  the  case  that stated, “[Applicant’s] overtime  hours have  been  decreased  and  is  [sic]
suffering from an unexpected illness and they can no longer make their Chapter 13 Plan
Payments.”  On  January  10,  2017,  the  bankruptcy  judge  granted  Applicant’s  motion  to
voluntarily dismiss the Chapter 13 case, “for Other Cause.” (GE 2.)
Applicant  agreed  that  he  had  been  encountering  difficulties  making  the  full
payments, and so advised his attorney, before his in-laws moved in to live with them and
donated funds to him and his wife for use resolving their Chapter 13 debts. He neither
signed, nor was aware of, the specifics of his attorney’s December 2016 formal motion to
dismiss the case. He testified that both reasons played into their determination to use the
available funds to resolve the debts rather than continuing to make payments under court
supervision,  despite  the  fact  that  he  would  lose  the  benefit  of  paying  a  significantly
reduced total amount to resolve the debts through bankruptcy. When they obtained the
resources to meet their obligations to fully repay their creditors, they decided to honorably
do so. I find no evidence that Applicant attempted to conceal any of these material facts,
which he has freely disclosed and discussed throughout this process. (GE 1; GE 2; GE
3; Tr. 29-30, 32, 48-51, 58-60.)
After  increasing  the  Federal  income  tax  withholdings  from  his  paycheck,  as
discussed above with respect to SOR ¶ 1.h, Applicant and his wife received refunds from
the IRS for tax years 2014 and 2015. Their then-active Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan called
for them to turn over any refunds in excess of $1,500 to the trustee for use in making plan
payments.  Their  attorney  did  not  make  them  aware  of  this  requirement  until  the
bankruptcy trustee received notice of the refunds and petitioned the court to recover the
funds. On November 18, 2016, the court entered an order implementing an agreement
between the trustee and Applicant’s attorney to increase their monthly plan payments in
order to account for the  refund  recoupment. This situation  was  not an  irresponsible  or
surreptitious  attempt  to  unlawfully  retain  the  income  tax  refunds,  but  rather  a
misunderstanding  that  was  promptly  resolved  through  a  court-sanctioned  mutual
agreement. (GE 3; Tr. 21-22, 49-51.)
Three  current  and  former  supervisors,  with  extensive  experience  in  classified
programs,  wrote  letters  on  his  behalf.  They  uniformly  praised  his  character,  diligence,
trustworthiness,  dedication,  loyalty,  and  attention  to  compliance  with  all  applicable
security protocols. (AE B; AE C; AE D.)
