The amended SOR alleges that, as of February 28, 2020, Applicant owed $14,391
on a charged-off automobile loan (SOR ¶ 1.a); $449 on a charged-off account (SOR ¶ 1.b);
$6,104 in collection placed by a utility company (SOR ¶ 1.c); $1,540 in collection placed by
a storage company (SOR ¶ 1.d); $916 in collection by a utility company (SOR ¶ 1.e); and
$706 in collection placed by a fitness club (SOR ¶ 1.f). Applicant is also alleged to have
failed to file her federal income tax returns for tax years 2020 and 2021 by her June 15,
2022 hearing (SOR ¶ 1.g). Applicant admitted the delinquencies, which she explained were
incurred  largely  because  of  her  spouse’s  loss  of  income  due  to  multiple  injuries,  but
indicated that she has paid the fitness club debt. As previously noted, she admitted at her
hearing that she has not filed her federal income tax returns for tax years 2020 and 2021
because she cannot afford to pay a tax-return preparer.
I accept and incorporate as factual findings that the SOR debts became delinquent
as alleged and that Applicant has not file her income tax returns for the last two years.
After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 59-year-old media production associate with an associate’s degree
earned in June 1984 from a community college. (GE 1; Tr. 29.) She has worked for her
current employer, a defense contractor, since July 1985, and is currently on a technical
manual team. (GE 1; Tr. 40.) She has held a clearance for most of her employment, and
was first granted a DOD secret clearance in approximately 1999. (Tr. 31.)
Applicant and her spouse married in in February 2003, after they had been together
for 20 years. (Tr. 30.) Applicant indicated on her May 23, 2017 Questionnaire for National
Security Positions (SF 86) that she and her spouse separated in April 2016. They were
living apart at the time, but were not legally separated. They have a 35-year-old son and a
33-year-old daughter. (GE 1; Tr. 30.)
In March 1996, Applicant purchased a home that had three separate apartment
units. (GE 1.) They converted two of the units into one larger area. (Tr. 39.) No information
is in evidence showing the initial mortgage balance. While working for an office installation
company,  Applicant’s  spouse  was  injured  shortly  thereafter  when  a  freight  elevator
malfunctioned, and he was struck in the head. (Tr. 21.) He lost about 30% of his hearing
and was unable to work for several months. (Tr. 22.) He had no medical insurance to cover
his medical bills. (Tr. 24.)
When Applicant’s spouse was able to return to work, he tried some side jobs with
contractors that did not work out due to his hearing loss. (Tr. 22.) Applicant recalls that it
was  during  that  time  of  her spouse’s lack  of  stable employment that  she obtained the
assistance of a debt-repair company to negotiate with her creditors. She obtained a second
mortgage on their home (loan amount not in evidence), and with the funds paid off the
debts they had at the time with the assistance of the credit-repair company. (Tr. 50-51.)
She had some credit counseling at that time but has had no financial counseling since
then. (Tr. 50.)
While  helping  a  friend  with  a  roof  repair  around  June  2005,  Applicant’s  spouse
injured himself in a fall.  He was hospitalized for two months, although he had medical
insurance through Applicant which covered some of his medical debts. (Tr. 24.) When
Applicant’s spouse was able to return to work, his father got him a job as a longshoreman.
Applicant’s spouse  was not in that job long when a tractor-trailer truck backed him into
another trailer. He incurred multiple surgeries and was out of work for 18 months without
income before he received worker’s compensation. Medical insurance paid some of his
medical expenses, but some medical debts went into collections. Applicant took hardship
withdrawals from her retirement account at work to pay some of their debts. Even so, her
mortgage lender initiated foreclosure proceedings in 2009. Her account was last active in
June  2007.  (GE  3;  Tr.  23-24.)  After  vacating  her  foreclosed  home  in  October  2010,
Applicant rented her living quarters for the next ten years. (GE 1.)
In late 2013, Applicant had a car accident. Her vehicle, which she had bought in
August 2013, was determined by her insurer to be not repairable. Even though she had
gap insurance, her lender is holding her liable for a $449 debt on her loan (SOR ¶ 1.b).
During the 2014 to 2015 timeframe, Applicant’s financial situation was particularly dire. She
defaulted on the car loan for her next vehicle (SOR ¶ 1.a) around the time that her spouse
sustained a back injury. He became addicted to his pain medications and was out of work
for  at  least  a  month  while  undergoing  rehabilitation  treatment.  While  he  was  in  the
rehabilitation facility, Applicant could no longer afford the rent-to-own house in which she
had been living. She rented a storage unit for her belongings, and she moved into a motel
temporarily until she  could  save up enough money for a new apartment. She stopped
paying her rent for the storage unit (SOR ¶ 1.d). (Tr. 33-34.)
When Applicant completed her SF 86 in May 2017, she responded negatively to the
SF 86 financial record inquiries, including whether she had any possessions or property
repossessed or foreclosed in the last seven years; whether she had defaulted on any loans
in the last seven years; and whether any bills or debts had been placed for collection in the
last seven years. (GE 1.) As of July 25, 2017, the credit reporting agencies were reporting
several delinquencies on her credit report. The delinquency and payment histories of the
debts follow.
Charged-off account for $14,391 (SOR ¶ 1.a)
In January 2014, Applicant obtained a car loan for $24,437, to be repaid at $485 per
month for 73 months. The loan had a high interest rate. Applicant struggled to make the
loan payments. Her April 2019 credit report shows a date of last activity in November 2014.
(GE 2.) She surrendered the vehicle in a voluntary repossession when her spouse was in
the rehabilitation program. (Tr. 33.) In June 2015, her account was charged off for $14,391.
(GE 3.) She believed she owed nothing on the debt following the repossession until she
began receiving demands for payment of the deficiency balance. (Tr. 34.) She contacted
the creditor and was told the debt was in collections. She does not know who currently
holds the debt. (Tr. 33.) She has made no payments on that debt as of her June 2022
hearing. (Tr. 25, 33.)
Charged-off account for $449 (SOR ¶ 1.b)
In August 2013, Applicant obtained a car loan for $18,131, to be repaid at $139 per
month for 73 months. After making only a few payments on her car loan, she was in an
accident, and the insurance company totaled her vehicle. She received a settlement from
her primary auto insurer, but it did not fully cover the balance of her loan. She had gap
insurance, but due to a delay involving an issue with the title between the lender and her
gap insurer, she ended up owing $1,196. Her lender charged off that debt in November
2014. Her July 2017 credit report shows a $457 balance on the account with a date of last
activity in June 2016. (GE 3.) She does not believe that she should pay the debt as she did
not have the car and did not legally hold the title. Her lender was supposed to provide the
title  to  the  gap  insurer  by  a  certain  date  and  did  not  do  so.  (Answer;  Tr.  25,  35-38.)
Applicant disputed her liability for the debt with the creditor bank, but she does not know if
she has any paperwork about the debt. She has not contacted her creditor about resolving
the debt, which she believes is now around $1,000. (Tr. 36-37.)
Collection account for $6,104 (SOR ¶ 1.c)
In  November  2014,  a  utility  company  placed  a  $6,104  balance  in  collection  for
unpaid gas charges incurred in the home that was lost to foreclosure. As of June 2017, no
progress was reported on reducing the debt. (GE 3.) Applicant has not made any payments
on that debt as of June 2022. (Tr. 25, 39.) When she contacted the creditor, she was told
the debt had been written off. (Tr. 56.)
Collection account for $1,540 (SOR ¶ 1.d)
A $1,540 debt for the storage facility in which she placed her belongings when she
moved to the motel was assigned for collection in December 2015, was still outstanding as
of July 2017. (GE 3; Tr. 40.) Applicant has not tried to reach out to this creditor in recent
years, and she has made no payments on that debt as of June 2022. (Tr. 25, 40.)
Collection account for $916 (SOR ¶ 1.e)
A utility-services provider had placed a $916 debt for collection by July 2017. (GE 3.)
Applicant  believes  the  debt  is  from  the  second  gas  account  at  the  premises  lost  to
foreclosure in 2010 (Tr. 40), although it is unclear when that debt was incurred. The debt
appears only on the July 2017 credit report. There is no activity date or assignment date
listed for the debt, and the collection agent is not the same as that holding the larger gas
debt in SOR ¶ 1.c. Applicant has made no payments on the debt as of June 2022. (Tr. 25.)
Collection account for $706 (SOR ¶ 1.f)
Fees assessed for a gym membership went unpaid and were placed for collection in
the  amount  of  $706.  As  of  June  2017,  the  debt  had  not  been  paid.  (GE  3.)  Available
information does not reflect when Applicant incurred the debt. She paid the debt in 2020,
after she received the SOR. (Tr. 25, 61.) I held the record open after her hearing for her to
submit an email from the gym confirming her payment. No document was submitted.
Applicant’s July 2017 (GE 3) and April 2019 (GE 2) credit reports include an account
(not  alleged)  for  an  automobile  that  was  involuntarily  repossessed.  The  account  was
opened in January 2016 for $11,495, with terms of repayment at $433 per month for three
years. As of June 2017, she was reportedly $5,072 past due on a debt balance of $12,782.
As of April 2018, the account had a zero balance, so the creditor may well have taken the
vehicle in full satisfaction of the debt. However, Applicant was not asked about the debt,
and it was not alleged. As of April 2019, only the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b were still on
her credit report. (GE 2.)
While working for a roofing company, Applicant’s spouse purchased a 2010 model-
year truck with a loan of about $30,000, to be repaid at almost $640 per month for five
years. (Tr. 52-53.) Applicant testified that her spouse has about six months left on the loan
(Tr. 53), so it appears that he obtained the loan around early 2018. The loan has a high
interest rate because her spouse did not have established credit. She testified that he was
told that after the first three payments, he could refinance to lower their monthly payment.
They were not successful in refinancing the loan, and it has been a struggle to maintain
their payments. (Tr. 45-46.) The truck is used primarily by Applicant. (Tr. 46.)
In March or April 2020, Applicant received the SOR, informing her of the debts of
concern to the DOD. She paid the gym debt, but otherwise made no efforts to resolve her
past-due accounts. (Tr. 25, 33-40.)
Applicant and her spouse fell behind on other debts during the COVID-19 pandemic
due to his lack of steady income. He worked for a temporary agency that assigned projects
in the trades until April 2020 when construction jobs were shutdown. He was out of work for
a couple of months until June 2020, when he started working in roof repair for a real estate
company. In November 2020, with both Applicant and her spouse employed, they were
able to purchase their home, although she had to take withdrawals from her retirement
account at work to pay down their debt so they could qualify for their mortgage. (Tr. 26-29,
48.) Applicant does not recall exactly how much she withdrew from her retirement account.
She took $5,000 of her retirement funds for the down payment on her house.  (Tr. 53.)
Applicant did not provide any details about the mortgage loan other than that the monthly
payment is about $1,750. (Tr. 44.) She had been paying rent at $1,550 per month for the
previous four years. (Tr. 58.)
In June 2021, Applicant’s spouse lost his job when his employer went into “semi-
retirement”  and  no  longer  needed  his  services.  He  was  unemployed  for  the  next  ten
months.  (Tr. 26.) In February 2022, Applicant took a withdrawal of almost $4,000 from her
retirement account at work to pay bills. Some $3,000 of those funds went toward their
electric bill. (Tr. 53-54.) She concentrated on paying her household bills and some credit-
card debts incurred during the pandemic. (Tr. 37.)
In April 2022, Applicant’s spouse began working 32 hours per week at $14.70 per
hour for a municipality at its transfer station. (Tr. 26-29, 43.) Applicant’s annual salary with
her defense-contractor employer, after some 35 years with the company, is now close to
$60,000  following a  recent raise and a job promotion in May 2022. Her income varies
depending  on  overtime  availability.  (Tr.  41.)  Her  take-home  pay  for  the  two-week  pay
period was $1,275 on April 7, 2022; $1,782 on May 19, 2022; and $1,424 on June 2, 2022.
(Tr. 42.)
Applicant and her spouse are not presently able to pay all of their bills in full each
month by their due dates, although they make their mortgage payment of $1,750 on time.
(Tr. 29, 44.) She and her spouse owe about $5,000 in total credit-card balances. (Tr. 54.)
One of his credit cards is in collections status. Applicant is currently paying $46 a month on
a  credit-card  account  that  is  not  in  collections.  (Tr.  56.)  They  live  from  paycheck  to
paycheck, and Applicant has to choose between which credit-card account to pay one
month and which the next. (Tr. 57.)
Applicant and her spouse use propane for hot water and cooking, which costs them
about $200 to $300 for the year. They have electric heat, which in the winter costs them
almost $1,000 a month. They currently owe their electricity provider almost $5,000, and
she has been paying $550 a month under a payment plan to the utility company. Applicant
is looking into some state assistance for their electric bill on the basis of hardship. She has
been told that she qualifies for temporary assistance. Their cell phones cost them almost
$100 a month for two lines. They pay a similar amount for their Internet service. (Tr. 44-47.)
Applicant and her spouse have not yet filed their federal income tax returns for tax
years  2020  and  2021.  They  reside  in  a  state  that  does  not  tax  resident  income,  but
Applicant works in a state that taxes income earned in the state by out-of-state residents.
That state did not deduct income taxes from the paychecks of workers living in Applicant’s
state during the pandemic. Applicant does not expect to owe taxes for 2020 and 2021, but
she does not have the money to pay a tax preparer to file her returns. (Tr. 49-50.)
Applicant wants to pay her debts. She expects to be able to pay her debts over time,
now that her spouse is again employed, and she has overtime available to her until 2023.
(Tr. 51-52.) None of the creditors in the SOR are currently pursuing her for collection. She
recalls that, other than the car loan in SOR ¶ 1.a, none of her creditors have pursued her
for  collection  since  she  moved  on  vacating  her  first  home  following  the  foreclosure  in
October 2010. (Tr. 55.) She denies that she would compromise her job to pay her debts.
(Tr. 72-73.)
