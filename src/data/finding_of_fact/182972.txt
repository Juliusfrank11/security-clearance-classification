Financial Considerations
The  SOR  lists  26  allegations  under  this  concern,  the  first  two  are  for
indebtedness to the Federal Government and his state government for delinquent taxes
owed, and the remaining 24 allegations are for various delinquent accounts, all of which
are  discussed  in  further  detail  below.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  –  1.z)  These  allegations  are
established  by  his  April  30,  2019  SF-86;  his  February  12,  2020  DOHA  Response  to
Interrogatories,  containing  his  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  Report  of
Investigation  (ROI)  conducted  from  June  5,  2019,  to  August  1,  2019,  to  include  his
summarized  Personal  Subject  Interview  (PSI)  on  June  13,  2019;  his  May  15,  2019,
December 18, 2019, and June 17, 2021 credit reports; and his undated SOR Response.
(GE 1, 2, 4 through 6; SOR Answer)
During Applicant’s June  13, 2019 OPM PSI, he  stated that “[h]e feels bad about
his  debt  and  all  of  his  financial  issues  are  due  to  circumstances  that  resulted  in  him
losing  income.”  In  2013,  the  defense  contractor,  who  Applicant  was  working  for
changed, and the new defense contractor reduced Applicant’s income. As a result of his
reduced income, he was unable to remain current with his bills. In June 2014, he began
working with a credit repair company (CRC) and was able to pay off nine accounts. He
became dissatisfied with CRC because they were not paying his creditors on time and
he  replaced  CRC  in  June  2016  with  a  second  credit  repair  company  (CRC-2).  He
continued  to  use  CRC-2  until  2018,  but  stopped  using  them  to  pay  off  some  medical
bills.  In  March  2019,  he  resumed  using  CRC-2  and  continues  to  use  them.  Applicant
pays CRC-2 $500 per month to “pay off and negotiate and talk to them (creditors).” (Tr.
70, 112-113, 126; GE 2; AE AS)
During  his  testimony,  Applicant  reiterated  what  he  stated  in  his  June  13,  2019
OPM PSI adding that “in about roughly of 2013,” the defense contractor he was working
for lost their contract and  was replaced by a new defense contractor. In order to keep
his job, he had to take a pay cut. His salary was reduced from about $67,000 a year to
about $55,000 a year, which was approximately a $12,000 annual pay cut. However, he
regularly received pay increases every year with the new defense contractor. Applicant
stated his financial problems “didn’t really start till 2014 when [he] saw the reduced pay
cut that  [he] was no  longer able  to  pay [his] full  bills, like  [his] credit cards,  gas cards.”
(Tr. 32-33, 121-126)
Applicant  then  resorted  to  taking  out  high  interest  loans  to  pay  his  maxed-out
credit  cards.  (Tr. 33-35,  103-104)  He  stated  that  he  was  using  his  credit  cards  to  buy
‘[his]  stuff  besides  food,  like  DVDs  and  movies  and  stuff  and  comic  books  and  other
stuff to stay in the lifestyle that [he] was living.” He was also using his credit cards “to do
a  cash  advance  to  pay  some  of  this  other  stuff  off.”  (Tr.  35)  He  stated  that  he  never
gambled  and  never  will.  (Tr.  36)  His  mother  passed  away  in  2014,  but  he  was  not
required to pay for her funeral expenses because those expenses were covered by her
estate. (Tr. 37) A summary of Applicant’s SOR allegations follows.
SOR ¶ 1.a: Indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes in the
amount  of  $31,558  for  tax  years  2010,  2011,  2013,  2014,  2015,  2016,  2017,  and
2018.  Applicant denied  that  he  was  indebted  to  the  Federal Government for tax years
2010  and  2011,  stating  that  those  tax  years  were  paid  off.  He  admitted  that  he  is
indebted  to  the  Federal  Government  for  delinquent  taxes  for  tax  years  2013,  2014,
2016,  2017,  and  2018.  He  had  initiated  an  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS  dated
July  16,  2020,  with  monthly  payments  at  $300.  As  of  the  date  he  submitted  his  SOR
Answer, he had an outstanding balance of $21,453. (SOR Answer)
During his hearing, he stated that he has always filed his tax returns, and his tax
preparer  advised  him  to  set  up  a  payment  plan  with  the  IRS  for  any  taxes  owed.
Applicant  provided  documentation  that  he  had  initiated  an  updated  installment
agreement with the IRS dated April 24, 2021, with monthly payments at $691. His taxes
for 2010 and 2011 are paid. However, as of his hearing, he owed the IRS $19,369 for
tax years 2013 through 2018. He did not know how much he owed the IRS for tax years
2019 and 2020 (not alleged). He claimed that he would be paying off the balance owed
to  the  IRS  “in  the  next  three  months”  as  he  would  be  cashing  out  stock  valued  at
$34,758 from his former defense  contractor. (Tr. 39-46, 112; AE A through G, AE  AP,
AE O, AE AR, AE AZ)
Applicant stated  that he  owes taxes every  year “because  they  say  [he] make(s)
too  much.”  His  tax  preparer  advised  him  to  increase  his  withholding  tax;  however,
Applicant stated that if he reduced his take-home pay he “couldn’t continue to settle the
other  debts.”  With  that  said,  he  planned  to  increase  his  withholdings  in  October  2021.
He  stated  that  every  time  he  has  filed  his  tax  returns,  he  had  to  reestablish  a  new
payment plan with the IRS. He explained the nuances of his tax transcripts, established
that his taxes are paid for 2010 and 2011, and reiterated that he has always filed his tax
returns on time. He was unsure what he owes the IRS for tax years 2019 and 2020. (Tr.

and  2018.  He  provided  documentation  that  he  had  initiated  an  installment  plan,  with

$1,274 for tax year 2017 and $1,735 for 2018. (SOR Answer)
During  his  hearing,  Applicant  stated  that  in  addition  to  having  paid  off  his
indebtedness for tax year 2016, he had paid off his indebtedness for tax year 2017, and
owed $721 for tax year 2018, and provided documentation of  same. He added that he
was  indebted  to  his  state  tax  authority  for  tax  years  2019  and  2020,  and  those  years
were included in his existing installment plan. He had increased his monthly installment
payment to $275 on July 12, 2021. He was unsure of the amounts he owed his state tax
authority  for  tax  years  2019  and  2020.  (Tr.  57-61;  AE  J  through  L;  AE  AQ,  AE  AY)
